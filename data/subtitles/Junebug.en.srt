1
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,539
There's a lot of good people,
just point them out.

2
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:28,416
There. Mr. Wilson.

3
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:38,050
I'm going to mingle.
I'll see you later. Good luck.

4
00:01:38,676 --> 00:01:39,677
Thank you.

5
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:55,316
So now we're onto the 3rd of 3 pieces
by Zeppelin Crespo tonight.

6
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:57,651
I believe this to be the best one -

7
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,362
at least the most interesting
and unusual.

8
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:03,198
This is what Crespo called
a head trumpet painting

9
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,243
or sometimes a flubug painting.

10
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:08,286
These were made during
a very brief period

11
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:11,205
between Crespo's incarcerations
and when public health records

12
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,542
first indicated a diagnosis of autism.

13
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:17,336
This painting -
lot number 21 - is titled

14
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:21,548
"My True Love, True, True. True."

15
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:26,886
Let's start the bidding
for this amazing work at $7,000.

16
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:30,932
Ladies and gentlemen do I have $7,000
for this wonderful Crespo?

17
00:02:31,057 --> 00:02:34,518
Thank you, ma'am.
Can I have $7,500 for a good cause?

18
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:37,563
$7,500, Bernadette has on the phone.

19
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:42,401
Do I have $8,000 in the back row,
sir, with the hat.

20
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:43,819
You like this one?

21
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:46,738
Let's get it to $8,500.

22
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:49,157
Come on people,
I know there's money in this crowd.

23
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:52,702
$9,000, for this beautiful...

24
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:54,328
It makes me happy.

25
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,460
But I'm going to buy the UFO.

26
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:06,464
$9,500, Bernadette has on the phone.
Do I have $10,000?

27
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:23,952
Where did you come from?

28
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:50,920
Madeleine, this is Bill Mooney.
You remember me?

29
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:52,547
Oh of course I do.

30
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,382
I want to put my two cents in that

31
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:59,386
I agree that Wark is much better
for you than Micheaux would be.

32
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,889
And I think that you should
come down here yourself, maybe.

33
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:05,767
Because I think he would really be
into that.

34
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,686
And I think it would make
a big difference.

35
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:15,818
Oh. OK. You are so great. Really.
Let me think about it.

36
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:18,529
And I'll call you back. Goodbye.

37
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,574
He says he thinks it would make
a difference if I went down there.

38
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,540
Is this the Battle of Antietam?

39
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:34,585
Which one? Oh, yeah.

40
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,088
I recognize the corn fields.

41
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:57,690
Oh! A stout heart, my love,

42
00:07:57,815 --> 00:08:03,320
pray God grants to me and a promise
of my safe return."

43
00:08:03,445 --> 00:08:05,447
You know who wrote that?

44
00:08:05,655 --> 00:08:06,364
Who wrote that?

45
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:10,159
Glow-ray. You don't know her, do you?

46
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,078
I've never heard of her. Tell me.

47
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:16,707
That's because she come to me
in a dream. I dreamed that.

48
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:21,712
And I put it in the mouth
of a nigger slave right there

49
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,257
in that picture after getting captured.

50
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:30,136
Bless his heart.

51
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:36,809
Who is that out there?

52
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,022
That's my husband George. You met him.

53
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:27,397
I'm not kidding,
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven!

54
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:30,984
Yeah. I'll give him a day,
maybe and then I'll call.

55
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:38,324
Make sure you overnight the Cheerwine.
Cheer, like "Cheerleader".

56
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,617
Today.
I want him to have it immediately.

57
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,327
It's his favorite soda pop.

58
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,621
It's regional.
You can only get it down here.

59
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:46,414
George says
you can only get it down here.

60
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:48,249
So, do that.

61
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:54,171
OK, bye.
If this happens. Oh my God.

62
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:55,506
It will.

63
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,300
I think I'm in love.

64
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,344
It will!

65
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,225
You gonna make her a bird.

66
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:13,452
Fuck!

67
00:11:16,747 --> 00:11:18,374
Where are the cigarettes?

68
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:19,500
Top of the fridge.

69
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:20,834
Where?

70
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,252
Right there.

71
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,089
I can't find them.

72
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:27,507
Then we're out.

73
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:31,427
I found them.

74
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,596
I told you, they were right there.

75
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:39,226
We're out of cigarettes.
You got any matches?

76
00:11:39,393 --> 00:11:40,811
No.

77
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,192
Well, can I use your lighter? Perhaps?

78
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:53,281
Thanks!

79
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:54,532
Don't mention it.

80
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:59,370
Are you too busy to help out?!

81
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:02,289
You too busy
with them coming any minute?

82
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,125
And I know I can't even ask you
what's new because if it ain't...

83
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:10,129
on the sport pages in the funnies
you won't know about it.

84
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,140
Holy cow.

85
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,855
Did you eat all the rest
of my eggs?

86
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:30,732
What did you do with my eggs?!

87
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:32,525
Stuffed them up my butt!

88
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:34,402
How come every time
I read the paper you bother me?

89
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:35,820
- Go somewhere else.
- I'm back.

90
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:37,279
I can't spread
the paper out anywhere else.

91
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:38,614
You got your own room to go to!

92
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,449
Have you seen all the shit
she's got in there?!

93
00:12:40,574 --> 00:12:41,950
Where have you been?

94
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:43,452
Gone.

95
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:45,036
Did you go to the store?

96
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:46,037
Yeah.

97
00:12:46,204 --> 00:12:48,289
Did you remember to get my Vantages?

98
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:50,959
No. I forgot.

99
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,585
I figured you would.

100
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:54,212
No cigarettes in the whole damn house.

101
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:55,796
And no eggs.

102
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,882
Where's Ashley?

103
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,092
How should I know?

104
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:05,096
What?

105
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,963
Have you met her? Is she thin?

106
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:44,341
How could I have met here, Ashley?
Use your head.

107
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,721
I bet she is thin.
I bet she's prettier than I am, too.

108
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:52,723
I know I'm gonna hate her.
I can't wait.

109
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,145
Oh, did you know
I lost two more pounds?

110
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:01,273
Yesterday all I had to eat was
a hot dog with a little bit

111
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,233
of mustard and no bun.

112
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:08,863
I think you can tell that
I've lost some weight.

113
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,200
Johnny, look.

114
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:15,911
It's got all these exercises
you can do during your pregnancy.

115
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:17,371
It's got like 14 exercises

116
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:20,374
you can do after you give birth
to flatten your stomach.

117
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,043
Isn't that great?

118
00:14:24,753 --> 00:14:26,379
You making that for them?

119
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:31,384
Yes. Don't mess. Go sit or something.

120
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:46,106
I can't! I'm too excited.

121
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:48,566
- Ashley, sit down!
- What's she like?!

122
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,626
Have you thought of anything? Huh?

123
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:12,839
'Cause I know if we have a little boy
that we'll name him Johnny,

124
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:15,591
but I was thinking that if we have
a girl we could name her Jonni too,

125
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:18,344
but just spell it with an "I".
What do you think?

126
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:20,471
I think it's stupid.

127
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:25,100
Well, so are you. You're stupid too.

128
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:40,656
Johnny, Ashley, Pat, Eugene.

129
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:42,783
Peg.

130
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:47,871
Peg. What did I say? What did I say?

131
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:04,010
I'll be fine, right? I'll be fine.

132
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:10,391
Was that a car door?

133
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:12,810
I thing they're here.

134
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,520
They're here!

135
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:15,855
Oh lord!

136
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:22,486
Damn it. Look at this mess!
Are you coming?

137
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:24,279
You haven't seen your brother
in 3 years!

138
00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:24,780
Quit it!

139
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:27,073
I'd think you'd want to know what's
going on with him and welcome him.

140
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,327
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Come on Eugene, George is here.

141
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:32,787
George is here.

142
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:38,792
You're here! You're here!
You're here right where we live!

143
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,213
Hi! Look at you. You're here.

144
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:45,840
- You're about to burst.
- I know. I wrote you about it.

145
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,175
You're so thin.

146
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,512
- Hi, Momma.
- Darling. I'm so glad to see you.

147
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,181
I thought you'd never get here.
Guess what's upstairs?

148
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:55,683
Mr. Johnsten.

149
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:57,351
Hi!

150
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,396
Wow, you're so beautiful!

151
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,273
Fermented cheese just for you.

152
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,192
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi.

153
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,027
How do you do?

154
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,780
Do you diet?

155
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,782
No. I run. And swim.

156
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,456
What was that?

157
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,790
I smashed your birdie!

158
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,417
- No, darling-
- Ashley!

159
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,795
I just bumped the wall. I'm sorry.
We can replace it. Can't we replace it?

160
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,296
I declare, Ashley.

161
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:31,174
I'll pick it up! I'll pick it up!
Let me do it.

162
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:31,841
No, wait a minute.

163
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:35,428
You go on, upstairs and I'll see
if we got anything to feed you

164
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:37,930
after I clean up Ashley's mess.

165
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:42,184
You still got 3 left.

166
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,689
No wonder he's thin.
She sure don't look like she can cook.

167
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:50,400
I love her.

168
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:58,490
Johnny?

169
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:05,914
I'm Madeleine. I married George.

170
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:11,711
You got any cigarettes?

171
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:16,924
What? No. Sorry. I don't smoke.

172
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,801
George got any?

173
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,261
Oh. George doesn't smoke.

174
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,056
He give it up?

175
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:31,312
I can tell you're brothers.
You're just as handsome.

176
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:34,148
He give up being an asshole, yet?

177
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:35,691
Madeleine?

178
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,026
What was that?

179
00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:38,485
Madeleine, I'd swim too,

180
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,988
but I wouldn't be caught dead
in a bathing suit like this.

181
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:42,322
See, I'm about to have a baby.

182
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,073
No!

183
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,284
I am too. Any day now.

184
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:47,744
But I've got this exercise book,

185
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,913
and I'm trying to lose weight
'cause Johnny hates it when I'm heavy.

186
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,333
And I can't stand it either.
Do you have kids?

187
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,377
Oh no. No.

188
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,256
Have you ever been married before?
When did you and George get married?

189
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:04,509
It'll be exactly 6 months tomorrow.

190
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,136
I'll be damned.

191
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:11,849
I know. I actually find it hard
to believe myself.

192
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:16,187
How's Johnny?

193
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:18,689
Good.

194
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:22,276
He still working at Replacements Ltd?

195
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:26,905
Still there. Back living here.

196
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,910
It's good you come down here.

197
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:40,626
I want to know everything
there is to know about you.

198
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,836
I want you to tell us
every little thing.

199
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:44,254
God. That would be so boring.

200
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:49,259
Not to me. What makes you tick?

201
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:53,971
All we got is dry cereal for you.

202
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:56,557
That's fine, Pat.
Can I do anything to help?

203
00:19:56,724 --> 00:20:00,853
No. Nobody messes in my kitchen.

204
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:07,317
Oh, OK. Pat, your little ceramic thing.
It wasn't-

205
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,068
Are you wearing make-up?

206
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:10,778
'Cause, you could wear more
if you wanted to.

207
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:12,822
You're so tall. I'm fair.

208
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,491
But, I like to experiment
with a lot of different looks.

209
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:17,660
Were you born in Chicago?
I was born right here.

210
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:21,413
I've lived here all my whole life.
My favorite animal is the meerkat.

211
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:22,706
Do you know what they are?
They're so cute.

212
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:25,792
I've got this little charm bracelet
with meerkats on it.

213
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,586
Did you have lots of boyfriends?
I bet you did.

214
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:30,255
Did you ever try out
for cheerleading or anything?

215
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,340
I tried out, but I didn't make it.

216
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:40,431
I was born in Japan.

217
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:44,810
You were not.

218
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,938
My father was in the diplomatic service.
And then we moved to Africa.

219
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:51,316
And then to Washington, DC
for a short while

220
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:54,318
and then back to Africa
and then to Chicago.

221
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:59,114
Wow. What kind of things did you like
to do when you were a little girl?

222
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:00,657
What type of things?

223
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:02,909
Reading and horseback riding.

224
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:04,536
At the same time?

225
00:21:05,787 --> 00:21:08,164
No. I never tried it at the same time.

226
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,047
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

227
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:19,299
I have a half-brother now
but he's gone now.

228
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:21,260
So that's why
this is pretty much my family.

229
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:23,553
And children
are the most important thing.

230
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,306
They're so important.

231
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:31,936
Can you still have kids?

232
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:33,521
Ashley!

233
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:37,691
George wrote that you own
a art museum or something?

234
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:42,195
Yes. An outsider gallery.
Self-taught artists.

235
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:46,241
That's my cellphone.
Don't worry, I'll just call back.

236
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:47,409
And that's why we're here really.

237
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:53,247
We drove down to meet- have you heard
of this artist from Pinnacle - David Wark?

238
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,124
Wark?

239
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:59,169
He lives about half an hour away.
Most people haven't heard of him yet.

240
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:03,048
Anyway we drove down to meet him.
For the gallery.

241
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:06,009
I wouldn't think you'd have to come all
the way down here from Chicago

242
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:08,094
to find a good artist.

243
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:13,349
And I insisted to George -
I said if we're this near anyway,

244
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,017
let's come here.

245
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,602
You drove all that way?

246
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:20,647
We stayed one night.
We had sort of a little honeymoon.

247
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,525
And then last night
we stayed in Asheville.

248
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:26,069
- You stayed in Asheville last night?
- Yes. Last night.

249
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:27,070
Well.

250
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:30,365
And then we work up early this morning
to see David Wark.

251
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:32,241
And that's so exciting.

252
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:36,120
He paints mostly his conceptions
of the Confederate War.

253
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:39,957
It's extraordinary.
He's not schooled or trained.

254
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:43,043
If you get him talking
he goes off on these ideas,

255
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,337
and it's strange
because he sort of gets confused

256
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,298
with his own personal history
and that of the world.

257
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,883
Momma Peg does arts and crafts!

258
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:58,474
That's great. And George told me that
you do woodworking, Mr. Johnsten.

259
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:02,311
Just call him Eugene. That's his name.

260
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:03,729
Eugene.

261
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:08,483
Come on. I want to show you your room.

262
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,484
I'll get that.

263
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:13,321
No. It's OK. I like to carry things,
it's good for me.

264
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:17,158
I bet you went to college, huh?
I want to go to college.

265
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:26,124
Here's you all's room, it's the nursery
You'll love this. Paw made that cradle.

266
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:28,126
Johnny helped him.
Of course they need to paint it.

267
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,002
They made this?

268
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:30,628
Yeah. Here's the bathroom.

269
00:23:30,795 --> 00:23:33,631
We're going to share that,'cause
my bedroom's right through there.

270
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:38,927
So if you get lonely at night and you
want to talk you can just go like,

271
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:42,764
knock on the wall
and then I'll know it's you

272
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:46,059
and I can come out and we can talk.

273
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:55,609
Shouldn't I tell Pat about her thing?
I should replace it.

274
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:58,529
No. Don't worry about it.
She's got lots of them.

275
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:05,660
And I want her to like you.
And Madeleine, you keep calling her Pat.

276
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,078
Her name's Peg.

277
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,455
Oh, fuck.

278
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:15,086
I'll let you alone right now.

279
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:16,462
OK.

280
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:19,214
I want to hear all about how you
and George met and everything.

281
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,133
Was it love at first sight?

282
00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:24,302
Yeah.

283
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:25,554
Really?

284
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,433
Yeah. I saw him at the gallery
and a week later we were married.

285
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:39,024
I love that.
That is so fuckin' cool, Madeleine.

286
00:24:45,071 --> 00:24:46,573
Can I help you unpack?

287
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:50,702
There you are.
We thought we'd lost you, George.

288
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:54,956
Look at you! You just light up a room.

289
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,459
Hey, man.

290
00:24:59,793 --> 00:25:00,836
Hi.

291
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:05,006
Where you going?

292
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:07,842
I'm late.
Some of us do real work, you know.

293
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:10,970
Where's Madeleine?

294
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,972
Sit down, it's breakfast!

295
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:26,276
Hi. If you go to the mall today get me
the Cliffnotes for "Huckleberry Finn".

296
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,319
Let's go to the mall.

297
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:30,488
I love that book. It's my favorite.
Don't you love it?

298
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:31,989
No. I'm getting the Cliffnotes.

299
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,784
It's for his GED.
He didn't graduate high school.

300
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,786
We just loved each other too much
to wait.

301
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,621
- Ashley! Do you ever stop it?
- No.

302
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,998
See you later.

303
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,627
How you getting to work?

304
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:49,214
Norman's giving me a ride.
If he ever fuckin' gets here!

305
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:55,803
Let's go to the mall now. Let's do.
You'll love the mall.

306
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:58,681
It's got like a thousand fountains
and it's got this fudge factory!

307
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:01,016
And it's got a Nike store,
and a Barnes and Noble's,

308
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:02,309
and I can show you Aladdin's Castle

309
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:04,394
which is this arcade where
I first saw Johnny.

310
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,565
And there's Joanne's Nuthouse which is
where you get nuts and almonds.

311
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:11,734
Hey guys,
Madeleine wants to go to the mall!

312
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,640
Johnny Johnsten! Johnny Johnsten!

313
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:53,940
Johnny Johnsten! Johnny Johnsten!
Goddamn it!

314
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:04,491
Who's got their Panther pride?
Count down, boys.

315
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:07,869
Johnny, 200 more days. Panther pride!

316
00:27:08,244 --> 00:27:11,706
Panther! Let's catch scratch
those motherfuckers!

317
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:13,583
Next year,

318
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:15,126
I guaran-goddamn-tee it they're going

319
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:17,670
to fuckin' at least go to the fuckin'
Superbowl again.

320
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,213
Guaran-goddamn-tee it.

321
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,174
I'm serious.

322
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:27,095
I will not get a girlfriend ever.

323
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,057
I'm sick of it goddamn it.
Tarra, are you in love? You're in love.

324
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,686
Yes, I'm in love now. His name is Keith.

325
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:37,730
Why don't you ever bring him
around here?

326
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,773
No. He's a professional football player.

327
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,942
Shut up! What position?

328
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:43,026
Fullback.

329
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:45,487
I worked with this one guy.
He liked to go deer hunting.

330
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:48,907
He got a tic stuck on his anus.
He thought it was a hemorrhoid.

331
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:51,284
He kept on putting Preparation H
on it for week,

332
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:52,368
made it all supple.

333
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:53,828
He had his wife look at it
and she screamed,

334
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:56,038
Oh my God, it's a tic.

335
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:58,666
He pulled it off and stomped it
and it wouldn't even crush

336
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,876
because the Preparation H
made it so soft.

337
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:02,336
I don't know what love is, dude.

338
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:05,297
Man, my neighbors
are just driving me up the wall.

339
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:06,298
And they're in love.

340
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:07,340
They're technically in love,

341
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:11,552
but they're fighting over
a fuckin' goddamn mini-dish.

342
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:15,181
Get a mini-dish, is all I'm saying!
Just get a goddamn mini-dish.

343
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:16,974
This is the best fuckin' job I ever had.

344
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:18,309
Shut the fuck up.

345
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:20,769
I tell you what though,
you should come over to the house, man.

346
00:28:20,894 --> 00:28:24,189
I got that Superbowl on tape.
I been watching it like every other day.

347
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:26,274
I always feel like they're going to win,
you know,

348
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:29,402
if I watch it on tape I fell like
they're going to pull it out.

349
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:33,489
But they never do. They never do.

350
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:39,370
Let's do it now.

351
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:41,830
Here?

352
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:45,292
Yeah! Don't you like 'Cinnamon Fizz'?

353
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:48,503
We can play beauty parlor.

354
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,176
Why hello, Miss Madeleine.
You called about...

355
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:17,154
'Cinnamon Fizz'.
Don't you just love the way that sounds?

356
00:29:24,703 --> 00:29:27,038
I suddenly have the urge to drink this.

357
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:33,252
Oh, that could be hormonal. Pica.
Do you feel like you want to eat dirt?

358
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,421
Or clay, as well?

359
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:41,426
No! Yuck! What do you think I am? Clay.

360
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:45,972
No. Yuck.

361
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:48,224
What'd you say that was - pica?

362
00:29:48,475 --> 00:29:51,310
Yeah. You might need iron, or something.
Do you take supplements?

363
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:52,478
No.

364
00:29:56,148 --> 00:29:57,983
I bet that's why George married you.

365
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:01,153
Why? What's wrong?

366
00:30:02,237 --> 00:30:09,661
Nothing. The head's just on my nerves.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

367
00:30:13,456 --> 00:30:14,707
What are you going to name it?

368
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,501
Junebug.

369
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:22,673
I mean, his real name will be Johnny
but we'll call him Junebug.

370
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,134
And if it's a little girl
we'll christen her Junebug Johnsten.

371
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:29,345
Can't you see a little baby
named Junebug?

372
00:30:33,724 --> 00:30:36,060
So you don't know what you're having?

373
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:38,145
A baby.

374
00:30:40,647 --> 00:30:43,108
No, I meant a boy or a girl?

375
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:47,821
Oh that. I don't know.
I don't want to know.

376
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:48,780
I want to be surprised.

377
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:52,116
I don't care, so long as it's healthy
and it looks like Johnny.

378
00:30:52,408 --> 00:30:54,327
What does he want?

379
00:30:57,163 --> 00:30:59,206
I don't know
if he wants a baby right now.

380
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:02,751
But I know just as soon as he sees it
he's going to fall in love.

381
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:04,461
He's just going through a phase.

382
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:06,671
I read in one of my books that
that can happen.

383
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,675
How long has he been like that?

384
00:31:12,343 --> 00:31:14,011
Two years.

385
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:18,223
But I know as soon as he sees that baby
he's going to snap out of it.

386
00:31:18,974 --> 00:31:22,185
I think. Yep.

387
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:26,773
What do you think?

388
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:31,069
I don't know him.

389
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:40,077
Gosh, I wish that
I could grow my nails out like this.

390
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:41,954
I'm always biting on mine.

391
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:45,749
I do too. But these are wrapped.

392
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:48,126
You are kidding me! These are fake?

393
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:50,253
Yeah. I used to bite my own ones
right down to the quick.

394
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,298
George doesn't even know.
I even bite my toenails.

395
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,180
You do not! I do too!

396
00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:04,516
I didn't think anybody else
in the world did that!

397
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:08,061
Ashley, what are you doing to her?

398
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:10,146
Cinnamon Fizz. Do you like it?

399
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:13,941
It's way past your nap time, Ashley.
You know what the doctor said. Come on.

400
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:15,609
I am not finished with her yet.

401
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:19,238
She's a grown-up.
She can finish her own fingernails.

402
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:22,699
Let me have that please.
I don't want that on my carpet. Go on.

403
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:24,993
Can I bum one of those?

404
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,872
For later.

405
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:35,711
Tah. Don't tell Geroge.

406
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:51,267
How was your day?!

407
00:32:55,813 --> 00:32:57,064
When's dinner?

408
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,221
Oh God. Don't stop. Don't stop.

409
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:48,153
Don't stop there. Do what you do-

410
00:33:58,621 --> 00:33:59,955
I'm serious.

411
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:45,121
Oh hey. Don't talk to me 'cause
I'm working out. Did you not go?

412
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:46,081
No!

413
00:34:46,206 --> 00:34:48,500
The Camaro still tore up?
Can't you fix it?

414
00:34:52,295 --> 00:34:54,130
George wanted to take us
to a fancy dinner tonight

415
00:34:54,255 --> 00:34:57,174
after the shower
but we got the church thing.

416
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,303
Hey, why don't you ask George?
He could help you fix it.

417
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:07,058
18, 19.

418
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,435
When did he call there?

419
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:12,605
This morning.
It was his sister who's a lawyer.

420
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:14,774
Did you know that he had a sister
who's also a lawyer?

421
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:16,358
What, a real lawyer?

422
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:18,861
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Fuck.

423
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:22,239
She's definitely negotiating something
with somebody in New York.

424
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:23,865
Okay. What gallery?

425
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,451
It sounds like it could be Mark Lane.

426
00:35:26,618 --> 00:35:29,245
Right, of course.
She thinks because they're in New York-

427
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:34,041
Yeah. She's influenced
by their highfalutin talking.

428
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:36,585
Wait. Did she sign anything?

429
00:35:36,752 --> 00:35:41,924
I have no idea. I mean, probably not.
I doubt it. I highly doubt it.

430
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:45,135
OK. No, I can handle this.
I can deal with this.

431
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,345
Okay. Are you having fun?

432
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,430
It's fine. You know what? I got to go.

433
00:35:49,556 --> 00:35:50,974
- You don't want me to call?
- Okay, darling. Bye.

434
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,517
Okay. Bye.

435
00:35:57,104 --> 00:36:01,316
I think it's time for a game, ladies.
The how big is your belly game.

436
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:02,609
It's huge!

437
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:16,455
This is Madeleine.
This is my new sister.

438
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,498
Hi, Nice to meet you.

439
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:19,249
She's George's wife. Isn't she pretty?

440
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:21,126
That's my little tuxedo-

441
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:22,628
- Did you do that?
- I did.

442
00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:26,214
You are so good!
You can make anything, Miss Peg.

443
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:29,634
Do you have children?

444
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:31,552
No.

445
00:36:40,436 --> 00:36:42,396
The reason people like meerkats...

446
00:36:45,524 --> 00:36:47,067
you got 2 eyes looking right at you.

447
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:49,652
That makes them look kind
of humanoid to you.

448
00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:51,779
The meerkat approaching you

449
00:36:51,904 --> 00:36:54,365
creates a hostile defense
until it can smell you.

450
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,992
Ashley? Ashley!

451
00:37:01,663 --> 00:37:05,333
...help in reproducing individuals
where they're young.

452
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:10,380
Only the offspring of the alpha female
are allowed to live.

453
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:13,257
The others, if they happen
to get impregnated accidentally,

454
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:15,468
while the alpha female is pregnant

455
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:20,180
sometimes try to sneak their young
in with a newborn of the alpha female.

456
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:21,640
They live in social groups

457
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:27,312
of which non-reproducing individuals
contribute to the welfare of the...

458
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:33,818
Look at these. Thank you so much.
It's just too much.

459
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:39,698
Here, open this one.

460
00:37:39,782 --> 00:37:40,824
Okay.

461
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:47,747
What's this?

462
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:54,420
That's a baby spoon.
That should be in a museum.

463
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:56,213
I bet that's as old as crap, Ash.

464
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,715
Who's that from?

465
00:37:57,881 --> 00:38:00,843
I don't know.

466
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:04,971
Hush! Who gave this little old spoon?

467
00:38:05,138 --> 00:38:06,514
George and me.

468
00:38:08,725 --> 00:38:16,440
I love it. Thank you so much.
I love it. Thank you so much.

469
00:38:17,024 --> 00:38:19,318
It means so much that
you're here with me.

470
00:38:19,443 --> 00:38:22,946
I don't believe
that can go in the dishwasher.

471
00:38:24,656 --> 00:38:25,907
Thank you.

472
00:38:33,998 --> 00:38:35,166
Goddamm it!

473
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:41,922
Hold on second. Hold on. Sorry.

474
00:38:50,805 --> 00:38:52,140
Why are you swearing?

475
00:38:52,265 --> 00:38:54,350
I was trying to tape this fuckin' thing
on TV and it won't work.

476
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:57,394
Well, did you use a tape I already used?
Maybe the tab thingy is pushed in.

477
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,605
No, I did that. I pushed it in.

478
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:02,774
No, you push it in if you don't want
to tape something.

479
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:04,401
That's why it didn't work.

480
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:06,820
Here, let me help you.
What are you trying-?

481
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:13,743
No! No! Go on! Forget it. Go on.
Forget it. Fuck it. Go on.

482
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:26,087
God loves you just the way you are

483
00:39:26,212 --> 00:39:28,756
but he loves you too much
to let you stay that way.

484
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:04,456
Lucille.

485
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:07,125
These people got the wrong house.

486
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:15,091
We're having a little thing for Ashley.
Her friends. Kind of last minute.

487
00:40:15,257 --> 00:40:18,969
We want that woman been courting
my brother's pictures. Is she here?

488
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:22,097
Hi Mrs. Speas! Hi.
We're having my baby shower.

489
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,516
You should come on in.
Who you got with you?

490
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:26,101
Madeleine?!

491
00:40:27,018 --> 00:40:28,144
God.

492
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:33,357
You all come on in. Sure. Come on in.

493
00:40:36,026 --> 00:40:37,486
I'm Madeleine.

494
00:40:37,653 --> 00:40:39,571
I've been trying to call you all day.
How did you find us?

495
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:42,157
A roomful of ladies.
Did you do this for me?

496
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:43,575
Of course.

497
00:40:43,784 --> 00:40:45,911
- That's my sister.
- How do you do?

498
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:49,497
Oh, I think it's that retarded
artist Madeleine knows.

499
00:40:50,873 --> 00:40:53,417
I'm telling you
they're not the right gallery for him.

500
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:54,543
They won't take care of him.

501
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,672
He sounds pretty good on the phone.
Course he never came himself.

502
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:01,300
Right. That's why I came down here,

503
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,386
because I love your brother's work,
ma'am. I love it.

504
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:07,597
They said you came down here
because your husband lives here.

505
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:08,723
Who said that?

506
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,266
The New York people.

507
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:12,185
No - it's just a coincidence.

508
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:15,438
They said you was small potatoes.

509
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:16,355
That's right.

510
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,109
Ma'am, honestly,
I can make your brother money.

511
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:21,693
Dear Jesus...

512
00:41:22,986 --> 00:41:23,653
If that's what you want.

513
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,779
Glory be to you, Lord,

514
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:30,660
I want to say thank you for this day
and for the blessings of this party

515
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:33,663
and for my friends
and all my presents-which I love.

516
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:37,291
And for the gift of life
growing inside me.

517
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,752
Help me to be a good Christian mother,

518
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:43,422
and to raise the child to praise
your name, Jesus. Amen.

519
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:44,756
Amen.

520
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:49,719
Sister Glow-ray from a beam
of light on high.

521
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:55,266
For those who suffered April 15,
1865 in the Battle of Bentonville.

522
00:41:55,391 --> 00:41:59,978
Who saw the serpent Sherman victorious
on North Carolina ground.

523
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:06,860
Forever we honor their risen souls...

524
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:07,986
Amen.

525
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,034
Amen.

526
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,954
How are you?

527
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:04,955
Just great.

528
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:06,539
Yeah? Have you been good?

529
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:11,377
My wife Madeleine. This is Mary.

530
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,506
We were kind of in school together.
A couple of years apart.

531
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:20,802
George Johnston,
you can't hide from me. Get up here.

532
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,305
- How you doing?
- Hey, Bud. I'm good.

533
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,181
You remember Emily?

534
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:25,849
- Hi. How are you?
- How are you?

535
00:43:25,974 --> 00:43:27,684
- I'm wonderful.
- Nice to see you.

536
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:30,144
Hey, Pastor, this is my wife Madeleine.
This is Bud.

537
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,271
Hi. You're so young.

538
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:35,024
It is nice to meet you.

539
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:43,782
Look. Who's that?

540
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:50,538
Will we see you tomorrow morning,
Mrs. Johnsten?

541
00:43:53,374 --> 00:43:54,667
That's you, darling.

542
00:43:56,085 --> 00:43:57,002
Oh, me!

543
00:43:57,169 --> 00:43:58,462
You don't know who you are yet, huh?

544
00:43:58,629 --> 00:43:59,588
No.

545
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:02,424
Well Eugene, I'm gonna pray
with you family here real quick.

546
00:44:02,591 --> 00:44:05,302
And then I got to get this show
on the road. Alright?

547
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:12,100
Lord, I just thank you
for this fellowship tonight

548
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:15,644
and for the safe return
of George to his home flock.

549
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:21,775
I pray, Lord, that you would bless
his marriage to Madeleine.

550
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:27,489
Or God that it would be
a spirit filled union.

551
00:44:28,615 --> 00:44:32,702
That they would see the impermanence
of this world.

552
00:44:33,411 --> 00:44:35,246
And pray, Lord God that
you would banish the Devil

553
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:37,248
and all evil-doers from their door,

554
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,417
no matter where they are
in the kingdom, Lord.

555
00:44:41,793 --> 00:44:43,420
Praise you Jesus.

556
00:44:43,545 --> 00:44:46,339
Amen.

557
00:44:46,506 --> 00:44:47,590
You ready for that song?

558
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:49,300
Uh oh.

559
00:44:49,717 --> 00:44:50,802
Come on.

560
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,638
Kind of a big room.

561
00:44:54,096 --> 00:44:55,806
It's good. Come on.

562
00:44:56,056 --> 00:45:00,185
Alright everybody,
you all knew that we had a treat

563
00:45:00,352 --> 00:45:03,814
when you heard George Johnsten
was back in town.

564
00:45:04,189 --> 00:45:05,690
Now don't tell a lie.

565
00:45:05,857 --> 00:45:08,151
Who of you all thought that
he was going to get out of here

566
00:45:08,276 --> 00:45:10,028
without giving us a hymn?

567
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:12,738
This wasn't my idea.

568
00:45:13,573 --> 00:45:17,660
I know you're a little rusty,
so I'm going to get Eddy McGee.

569
00:45:17,743 --> 00:45:20,037
Come on,
Eddy and bring your son up here.

570
00:45:20,245 --> 00:45:24,541
Come on up here and help this man out.
You remember the number don't you?

571
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:26,209
I think I need the book.

572
00:45:26,835 --> 00:45:30,213
- It's 283.
- Thank you.

573
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,510
This one here is, he's 16.
His voice just broke. He's singing bass.

574
00:45:39,722 --> 00:45:53,025
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
Calling for you and for me;

575
00:45:53,943 --> 00:46:00,866
See, on your portals He's waiting
and watching,

576
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:22,844
Watching for you and for me Come home,
come home, Ye who are weary come home;

577
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:38,776
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
Calling O sinner come home.

578
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:47,200
Oh for the wonderful love
He has promised,

579
00:46:47,325 --> 00:46:53,289
Promised for you and for me,

580
00:46:53,873 --> 00:47:00,212
Tho' we have sinned
He has mercy and pardon,

581
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:06,301
Pardon for you and for me.

582
00:47:07,635 --> 00:47:23,316
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary come home;

583
00:47:24,484 --> 00:47:42,793
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
Calling O sinner come home.

584
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:00,309
I don't think I'd ever move back
to Baltimore.

585
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:02,894
This is just so much more peaceful.

586
00:48:04,479 --> 00:48:05,063
Yeah, I hear you.

587
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:08,691
Momma Peg made it.
She makes most of my maternity stuff.

588
00:48:08,942 --> 00:48:11,319
It's so beautiful. Such lovely work.

589
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:16,824
It's not much,
but I'm kind of proud of it. You sew?

590
00:48:17,116 --> 00:48:19,326
Oh no, I can't do anything
with my hands.

591
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:20,869
You don't have to. You're smart.

592
00:48:21,411 --> 00:48:23,246
George knew that when he married you?

593
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,251
Hey. Why doesn't Madeleine hlep you
with you report?

594
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:31,129
She'd be good at it.
It wouldn't take much.

595
00:48:31,295 --> 00:48:32,797
You all could do it tonight.
Couldn't you? Please.

596
00:48:32,922 --> 00:48:34,131
Sure, I can help you.

597
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:36,300
You all ready to skedaddle?

598
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:37,593
I bet you get an A.

599
00:48:37,718 --> 00:48:38,802
Where did you get that?

600
00:48:58,362 --> 00:48:59,822
Hey Peter, we're going to go home.

601
00:49:07,954 --> 00:49:10,999
Come on!
You need an engraved invitation or what?

602
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:31,184
You coming to bed?

603
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,147
Not now. I'm looking for something.

604
00:49:42,861 --> 00:49:46,531
My Phillips-head.

605
00:49:52,245 --> 00:49:53,621
Peg?

606
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:41,790
Peg?

607
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,586
No, it's me Ashley.

608
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,131
There's some 'Zingers'
on the bottom shelf.

609
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,468
Oh, I'm just getting a carrot.

610
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,768
Dolly would be a nice name.

611
00:51:27,248 --> 00:51:31,669
I turned the light on and everything.
Are you going to go?

612
00:51:35,172 --> 00:51:37,967
She's really, really smart
and she wants to help you.

613
00:51:47,684 --> 00:51:49,435
I'll wait up, OK?

614
00:51:59,945 --> 00:52:01,071
He's ready for you.

615
00:52:01,196 --> 00:52:02,155
OK.

616
00:52:02,322 --> 00:52:05,075
You look so pretty. You smell good too.

617
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,579
All baby powder and shampoo-y.

618
00:52:10,913 --> 00:52:12,832
I'm going to bed.

619
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,042
OK.

620
00:52:16,168 --> 00:52:18,545
- Good night.
- Good night.

621
00:52:18,796 --> 00:52:20,005
- Thank you.
- OK.

622
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:52,618
So what do we do?

623
00:52:55,955 --> 00:52:57,206
Write a paper.

624
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:01,627
They don't believe you read it unless
you can write a paper on it.

625
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:04,629
So... a paper.

626
00:53:06,131 --> 00:53:07,674
Have you read any of it?

627
00:53:07,841 --> 00:53:09,467
Yeah. I looked through it.

628
00:53:10,968 --> 00:53:12,136
Did you think it was funny?

629
00:53:15,181 --> 00:53:17,182
No. I thought it was long.

630
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:21,311
OK.

631
00:53:29,277 --> 00:53:30,111
What?

632
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:31,654
- Nothing.
- What?

633
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:39,870
You smell like George. OK.

634
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:44,457
How about I help you
with some of the themes?

635
00:53:50,755 --> 00:53:54,717
OK, how about you help me
with some of the themes.

636
00:53:55,926 --> 00:53:57,219
OK?

637
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:06,269
OK. How about escape?

638
00:54:07,479 --> 00:54:10,356
Huck, and Jim,

639
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:13,859
are constantly managing to
just wriggle out

640
00:54:13,943 --> 00:54:15,194
of one situation before-

641
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:16,487
Who's Jim?

642
00:54:18,238 --> 00:54:19,323
The black man.

643
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,367
The slave -
traveling down the Mississippi.

644
00:54:22,534 --> 00:54:25,245
Oh, yeah. Jim.

645
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:36,714
OK. Well, their relationship is a -

646
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:44,804
it's Huck's gradual sort of love affair
with this slave is the major theme-

647
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,681
Wait. They fall in love with each other?

648
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:48,099
No, not love affair like that

649
00:54:48,183 --> 00:54:49,517
I don't think you're talking
about the right book.

650
00:54:49,684 --> 00:54:50,435
I'm not talking about a romance.

651
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,728
Two people can love each other
and it's not really -

652
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:59,193
It's more... respect.

653
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:06,241
Huck comes to see this slave
as a real person.

654
00:55:06,366 --> 00:55:11,829
A whole person. Like himself.
And that's a new insight.

655
00:55:14,498 --> 00:55:18,544
This is what
you'd call a picaresque novel.

656
00:55:18,711 --> 00:55:20,921
That's good word to use.

657
00:55:22,172 --> 00:55:26,593
And it means, usually,

658
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,806
a main character that's traveling like
'Don Quixote', or 'Candide'.

659
00:55:31,973 --> 00:55:36,143
You think I'm a complete idiot,
don't you?

660
00:55:36,894 --> 00:55:46,152
No. God no. I just don't know how much
of this book you've read.

661
00:55:47,028 --> 00:55:49,030
And it's a pity,
because it's a great book.

662
00:55:49,155 --> 00:55:51,032
And it is really funny.

663
00:55:51,783 --> 00:55:53,909
Doesn't this boy's dad try to kill him?

664
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,370
Yeah.

665
00:55:56,537 --> 00:56:01,541
That's not funny.
You're doing this to make fun of me.

666
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:13,552
No, I'm not. I'm trying to help you.
Let's just read the first chapter.

667
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:17,264
It actually lays out
a lot of the themes.

668
00:56:18,182 --> 00:56:22,269
Are you listening to me? Will you do it?

669
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:24,396
What?

670
00:56:24,521 --> 00:56:26,314
Just read the first chapter.

671
00:56:26,898 --> 00:56:29,484
I don't have to. That's why I got this.

672
00:56:44,998 --> 00:56:50,795
You're right. This thing it tells you
everything I could have told you.

673
00:56:53,756 --> 00:56:56,091
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
Do you?

674
00:57:06,017 --> 00:57:12,899
It's been hard, lately, around here.

675
00:57:15,317 --> 00:57:16,318
What do you mean?

676
00:57:16,861 --> 00:57:22,532
Just with everything. You know?

677
00:57:23,825 --> 00:57:25,702
Oh. Did you not want to have children?

678
00:57:31,082 --> 00:57:34,418
I would have gone to Washington,D.C.
In 12th Grade.

679
00:57:34,502 --> 00:57:40,549
You know? Except for her.
She kept looking at me all junior year.

680
00:57:40,716 --> 00:57:44,845
And I couldn't concentrate.
That fucked me up.

681
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,096
So, when is this due?

682
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:47,722
Any fucking time now!

683
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,892
No, I meant the paper.

684
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:54,145
Tell me what you're doing here.

685
00:57:55,312 --> 00:57:56,230
What do you mean?

686
00:57:56,397 --> 00:57:59,024
Tell me what you
and George are doing here?

687
00:57:59,191 --> 00:58:00,484
- Johnny.
- Fuck you.

688
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:05,238
I don't need George sailing in here
all-help out poor Johnny, some shit.

689
00:58:05,405 --> 00:58:07,115
No. None of us need shit from you.
Okay?

690
00:58:07,282 --> 00:58:07,741
Johnny.

691
00:58:07,907 --> 00:58:10,618
And fuck Huck Finn! Fuck!

692
00:58:10,827 --> 00:58:16,540
Johnny, stop! Stop. Oh God. Sorry.
Darling, I'm trying to help you.

693
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:19,835
I wasn't laughing at you.
I wasn't laughing at you.

694
00:58:20,043 --> 00:58:27,217
We didn't come here to upset you. Okay?
I'm sorry. Just be still. Sorry.

695
00:58:34,098 --> 00:58:35,182
There.

696
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:42,522
What are you doing?

697
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,319
Hey.

698
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:58,954
Oh shit. I'm sorry. Oh my god, Johnny,
it's so sweet almost. I'm sorry.

699
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:01,456
What, you think I'm a fuckin' idiot?

700
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:03,792
Ever since you got here
you've been playing me, man.

701
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:06,795
Don't tell me
you didn't mean anything by it.

702
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,590
I know it when I see it.
I'm not stupid! I'm not an idiot!

703
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:16,220
Johnny, you completely misunderstood me.
I was helping you. Sweetheart, listen-

704
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,389
Oh shut up! You bitch! Fuck!

705
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:23,560
Where the hell you think
George come from anyway?

706
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,520
He's no better than us!

707
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:29,065
- He doesn't think-
- And neither are you. Alright?

708
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,444
Flaunting around! We all see it!
We're not stupid.

709
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,030
I don't know what George
isn't giving you,

710
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,781
but you want something.

711
00:59:58,008 --> 01:00:10,436
Oh he taught me to love him.
He promised to laugh.

712
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:32,874
He called me his blossom.
He called me his flower.

713
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:39,004
A blossom to cheer him
though life's weary hour.

714
01:00:40,172 --> 01:00:45,885
But now he has gone and left me alone.

715
01:00:49,264 --> 01:00:54,060
The wildflowers to weep
and the wild birds...

716
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:05,820
Where would I be if I was a screwdriver?

717
01:03:11,686 --> 01:03:12,603
You may be seated.

718
01:03:16,565 --> 01:03:20,360
You all, when was the last time
you were so filled up

719
01:03:20,527 --> 01:03:22,571
with the Holy Spirit
that people mocked you?

720
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:26,324
And said, That person must be drunk.

721
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:28,618
That person must be filled
with new wine.

722
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:34,248
I think I have to confess that
that time for me may have been never.

723
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:50,388
Well, I don't like that she was
"just helping him out".

724
01:03:50,888 --> 01:03:53,140
I don't think anyone
ever taught her how to do.

725
01:03:53,391 --> 01:03:54,016
Do what?

726
01:03:54,141 --> 01:03:56,602
Do right. Don't be dumb.

727
01:03:58,354 --> 01:04:04,484
I like her. She means well.
George likes her.

728
01:04:04,651 --> 01:04:06,444
She doesn't know George.

729
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:08,238
She loves him.

730
01:04:08,571 --> 01:04:10,156
What do they have in common?

731
01:04:11,824 --> 01:04:12,867
He loves her.

732
01:04:13,242 --> 01:04:15,578
And then she's up all hours with Johnny?

733
01:04:15,828 --> 01:04:20,666
I don't like it.
I want you to say something to her.

734
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:28,214
Are you listening to me?
Don't be stupid.

735
01:04:28,339 --> 01:04:32,301
But just find out if she
and George are happy.

736
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,595
And tell her Johnny and Ashley
are real happy.

737
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,890
We don't need some stranger
coming in here messing things up.

738
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:42,060
She ain't a stranger. She's family.

739
01:04:42,894 --> 01:04:48,775
She's still strange.
She's older. She's too pretty.

740
01:04:48,942 --> 01:04:52,361
And she's too smart
and that's a deadly combination.

741
01:04:52,528 --> 01:04:53,487
Hi.

742
01:04:56,323 --> 01:04:57,866
Speak of the devil.

743
01:04:58,742 --> 01:05:02,954
So, how was church? Where's George?

744
01:05:03,413 --> 01:05:04,456
Gas.

745
01:05:05,457 --> 01:05:06,624
He left again?

746
01:05:08,626 --> 01:05:12,797
Eugene says that you
and Johnny stayed up late last night.

747
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:17,051
Yeah. I was helping with his paper.
Kind of.

748
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:24,266
Talking. I guess that's the way
you do things in Chicago?

749
01:05:24,641 --> 01:05:26,101
What? Say up late?

750
01:05:26,601 --> 01:05:28,645
Yeah. Talking.

751
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:31,856
Remember when we used
to go honkytonking at the Grange?

752
01:05:31,981 --> 01:05:33,316
Be quiet, Eugene.

753
01:05:33,441 --> 01:05:34,734
We stayed up till all hours.

754
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:38,112
Eugene, nobody's listening to you.

755
01:05:44,451 --> 01:05:46,494
Eugene, sit up straight.

756
01:05:47,537 --> 01:05:48,955
And remember what I said.

757
01:05:53,709 --> 01:05:57,004
She's a very strong personality,
isn't she?

758
01:05:57,254 --> 01:06:01,758
That's just her way.
She's not like that inside.

759
01:06:04,177 --> 01:06:06,554
She hides herself.

760
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:10,016
Like most.

761
01:06:17,314 --> 01:06:18,649
What are you looking for?

762
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:21,068
Oh, nothing.

763
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,366
My screwdriver, I guess. It's nothing.

764
01:06:29,742 --> 01:06:31,619
How long
have you been doing woodworking for?

765
01:06:31,744 --> 01:06:33,037
I'd love to see your-

766
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:49,302
Hey!

767
01:06:51,846 --> 01:07:00,604
Hey! You all! I think this is it!
Hi. They're getting really close.

768
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:02,105
I knew I should have washed my hair
this morning.

769
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:03,065
- What can I do?
- Hey, Ashley.

770
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,274
Could you cut my toenails?

771
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:05,900
- Are you sure this is it?
- Sure.

772
01:07:06,067 --> 01:07:07,068
Let me get my scissors.

773
01:07:07,193 --> 01:07:08,903
They been coming all morning,
I've been timing them.

774
01:07:09,028 --> 01:07:12,740
They're really close. Johnny?!

775
01:07:18,787 --> 01:07:19,455
Where you going?

776
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,622
Bring the car up front.

777
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:22,624
Don't just stand there. Go get the car.

778
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:25,126
Hey, do you have
any of that nail polish left?

779
01:07:25,293 --> 01:07:27,045
I know I have clippers.
I'm just looking!

780
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,171
What's going on?

781
01:07:28,296 --> 01:07:30,048
Your baby that's all. Where you been?

782
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:33,009
It's OK. Relax, honey.
We got plenty of time.

783
01:07:33,134 --> 01:07:35,970
- What do you want me to do?
- Why don't you got get the car.

784
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:37,638
Your daddy's got it.

785
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,224
Okay. I need my little suitcase it's-

786
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:41,808
No, don't tell me that.
I want to do something important.

787
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,644
Call the doctor?

788
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,564
Lord have mercy!
What do you think I'm doing?

789
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,317
The line is busy.
Go get her little suitcase!

790
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:57,156
How can every line
at the hospital be busy?

791
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,324
What if we had an emergency?!

792
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,619
Breathe.

793
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,247
It's alright. It's fun!

794
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:08,541
Just think after all this
I get to take home a baby, too.

795
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:09,500
Damn it to hell!

796
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:10,960
- It's better than Christmas!
- Come on, let's go.

797
01:08:11,127 --> 01:08:11,794
Come on, get up.

798
01:08:11,919 --> 01:08:12,628
I got it!

799
01:08:12,753 --> 01:08:14,797
Thank you. Could you go grab my flower
flops please.

800
01:08:16,215 --> 01:08:17,967
- Where are they?
- They're in there.

801
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:19,426
I know. But where?

802
01:08:19,593 --> 01:08:21,345
By my side of the bed.

803
01:08:21,511 --> 01:08:22,220
What do they look like?

804
01:08:22,387 --> 01:08:24,139
- Shoes!
- Brown!

805
01:08:32,897 --> 01:08:34,774
I'm sorry. You stay here.

806
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:37,359
When George gets home tell him to come
on to the hospital. He'll be a help.

807
01:08:37,484 --> 01:08:38,610
OK.

808
01:08:38,944 --> 01:08:42,114
Pop the trunk!

809
01:08:42,447 --> 01:08:43,407
I'm trying.

810
01:08:43,532 --> 01:08:45,325
We'll keep you posted. You OK?

811
01:08:45,492 --> 01:08:47,535
Ashley, you're the one having the baby.

812
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,453
I know!

813
01:08:48,578 --> 01:08:51,998
Come on, let's go.
I don't want your water breaking.

814
01:08:52,165 --> 01:08:54,125
We just had that upholstery cleaned.

815
01:08:56,877 --> 01:08:59,421
Can you get in? Watch your head.

816
01:08:59,922 --> 01:09:02,382
I hope it's a big baby.
I want to lose like 40 pounds.

817
01:09:02,507 --> 01:09:04,885
Will you ride with your wife!

818
01:09:06,886 --> 01:09:08,388
Heaven's sakes.

819
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:13,643
Is everybody in?

820
01:09:13,934 --> 01:09:15,478
What do you think?

821
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,855
We bucking up.

822
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:20,691
Will you drive, Eugene?!

823
01:10:40,472 --> 01:10:41,932
Look!

824
01:10:42,057 --> 01:10:44,476
Come on. You'll get your one of
your own soon enough.

825
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:49,731
Hello?

826
01:10:49,897 --> 01:10:52,608
Bernadette! Oh, thank God!

827
01:10:53,234 --> 01:10:56,028
Did Jane ever get through to you?
We've been trying to call.

828
01:10:56,153 --> 01:10:58,322
I really don't want
to be the one to tell you this.

829
01:10:59,156 --> 01:11:00,032
What?

830
01:11:00,157 --> 01:11:02,117
David Wark isn't going with us.

831
01:11:02,242 --> 01:11:04,703
No! What? Why?

832
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:05,912
His lawyer or his sister,

833
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:07,580
called yesterday
and said they want to show

834
01:11:07,747 --> 01:11:09,499
in New York
so they're signing with Mark Lane.

835
01:11:09,582 --> 01:11:15,296
Shit. I just saw them.
He was here. He ate cake.

836
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:17,006
He went home with all the balloons.

837
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:20,050
He said he enjoyed the party.
Did you throw him a party?

838
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:24,012
No, it was-Nevermind.
What else did they say?

839
01:11:24,137 --> 01:11:26,139
I don't know what happened.
They offered them something he wanted.

840
01:11:26,264 --> 01:11:27,891
I don't know what it was.
You'll have to talk to Tommy.

841
01:11:28,057 --> 01:11:28,683
Tommy spoke to her-

842
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:34,438
No. No. Don't let anyone call him.
I'm going to go there.

843
01:11:34,563 --> 01:11:38,942
I'll go back there and I'll see him.
He likes me. We have a thing.

844
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:43,155
I'm just going to tell him
how much I love him.

845
01:11:43,321 --> 01:11:51,412
We're not going to lose him.
We're not going to lose him. Okay?

846
01:11:51,579 --> 01:11:52,330
Okay.

847
01:11:52,497 --> 01:11:54,915
- Okay.
- Okay.

848
01:11:55,082 --> 01:11:57,001
- Love you.
- Love you too. Bye.

849
01:11:57,126 --> 01:11:58,085
Bye.

850
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:07,760
There's got to be a cigarette
in this house.

851
01:12:12,515 --> 01:12:14,016
Are you allergic to any medications?

852
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,184
No.

853
01:12:15,351 --> 01:12:16,644
Are you taking any medications?

854
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:17,978
No.

855
01:12:18,937 --> 01:12:20,772
How many children do you have?

856
01:12:21,356 --> 01:12:23,233
Where you been? Timbuktu?

857
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,320
Sir, I'm sorry. You can't smoke in here
This is a non-smoking facility.

858
01:12:28,363 --> 01:12:29,364
Hey, wait a second.

859
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,075
Can I get you anything?

860
01:12:33,242 --> 01:12:35,995
My husband just walked out of the room.

861
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,997
He went to smoke a cigarette.
He'll be back.

862
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:29,711
We have to go.
We have to go to Pine Mountain.

863
01:13:29,836 --> 01:13:30,545
What? Why?

864
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,088
- Wark's signing with Lane Gallery.
- Are you smoking?!

865
01:13:32,255 --> 01:13:35,424
No! Come on, give me the keys. Hurry.

866
01:13:35,549 --> 01:13:36,634
I'll drive.

867
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,803
No. I'll drive. You're too slow.
Oh and Ashley's gone into labor.

868
01:13:39,928 --> 01:13:41,555
They've all gone to the hospital.

869
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:43,890
What?

870
01:13:45,517 --> 01:13:46,518
What?

871
01:13:49,145 --> 01:13:50,188
It means something.

872
01:13:50,563 --> 01:13:51,522
What?

873
01:13:51,773 --> 01:13:52,773
Family.

874
01:13:53,608 --> 01:13:56,819
Can I drop you off, George? Please.

875
01:13:56,944 --> 01:13:58,946
I don't understand why you don't know
how much this means to me.

876
01:13:59,113 --> 01:14:01,114
Do you want me to lose him?
Because I will.

877
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:03,617
And they won't take care of him.
You know that.

878
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,785
And actually, he's why we're here
in the first place.

879
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:07,787
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for him.

880
01:14:07,912 --> 01:14:08,955
I know.

881
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:13,834
You need to be there, I agree with that,
but I just don't think it's my place.

882
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,419
I think it is.

883
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:28,348
OK. I'll leave you
when we're closer to him.

884
01:14:28,473 --> 01:14:32,059
I'll leave you there
and go back to the hospital.

885
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:37,147
Really? Are you sure?

886
01:14:38,649 --> 01:14:43,862
If that's what you want.
If that's what you think is right.

887
01:15:01,753 --> 01:15:04,714
According to my chart
and according to everything,

888
01:15:04,839 --> 01:15:06,508
you've done extremely well...

889
01:15:24,983 --> 01:15:26,192
- Hey.
- Hey.

890
01:15:50,631 --> 01:15:54,468
It's as if I have this personal,
spiritual connection to what you do.

891
01:15:54,593 --> 01:15:56,178
You know? Ever since I was a child,

892
01:15:56,303 --> 01:15:59,598
I've been drawn
to things from the South.

893
01:15:59,765 --> 01:16:03,310
It's as I recognize something.

894
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:08,064
It's as if ever painting is
like my child.

895
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:12,735
My own child.
It's not just a commodity.

896
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,820
These other dealers,

897
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,780
they would just treat you
like a commodity

898
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:20,450
and they would never understand
your vision and your mission.

899
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:23,829
I believe, Mr. Wark,

900
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:27,457
I love your work more
than Mark Lane does.

901
01:16:28,124 --> 01:16:31,586
I'm a collaborator with God.

902
01:16:31,836 --> 01:16:35,214
This life here is
just a saddening well of tears.

903
01:16:35,381 --> 01:16:42,054
I got no great wish to tarry here.
And I'm ready to ascend anytime.

904
01:16:42,262 --> 01:16:48,226
But my job here is
to make the invisible visible.

905
01:16:48,393 --> 01:16:49,686
I want to help you.

906
01:16:49,852 --> 01:16:53,105
I want to give you the opportunity
to do just that. I can.

907
01:16:53,898 --> 01:16:58,027
There. There that's
my Niggerland Uprising series.

908
01:17:07,327 --> 01:17:11,289
I never could draw a colored face.
I've never known one personally.

909
01:17:30,181 --> 01:17:33,976
George. Hubby.

910
01:17:35,394 --> 01:17:38,063
His face stuck with me
and I put him in a painting.

911
01:17:46,363 --> 01:17:48,656
You could reach the whole of
Europe with me. Think about that.

912
01:17:48,781 --> 01:17:50,283
Sissy says New York.

913
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:52,743
Okay, if New York is the obstacle

914
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:55,454
I can absolutely guarantee you that
we would show in New York.

915
01:17:55,579 --> 01:17:57,248
We work with Mimi Steinberg there-

916
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:58,499
- Jew?
- Love you.

917
01:17:58,624 --> 01:17:59,666
What?

918
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:02,794
Jewess? That lady?

919
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:08,633
That wouldn't be what we'd want to do.

920
01:18:11,844 --> 01:18:13,846
Mark Lane is Jewish.

921
01:18:14,805 --> 01:18:16,807
What?

922
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:25,357
Nothing. I would be your representative.
Personally.

923
01:18:25,482 --> 01:18:27,150
To the whole world
you would only deal with me.

924
01:18:27,275 --> 01:18:29,277
Whatever you want,
I would get it for you.

925
01:18:35,825 --> 01:18:41,038
A Barker's Fruit Basket.
You get me one of those.

926
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:43,039
I had one when I was a kid.

927
01:18:43,248 --> 01:18:44,833
I don't know
if they still make them or not.

928
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,544
You get that and the deal is yours.

929
01:18:49,587 --> 01:18:50,838
That's all you want?

930
01:19:02,265 --> 01:19:09,188
You promise to join me
with God's angels in my quest,

931
01:19:09,355 --> 01:19:10,690
you done that.

932
01:19:11,899 --> 01:19:16,028
And you believe
in Jesus Christ as your personal savior.

933
01:19:16,153 --> 01:19:17,571
I believe in you.

934
01:19:19,865 --> 01:19:23,160
I look in your eyes
and I view your soul,

935
01:19:23,285 --> 01:19:25,495
clear as spring water.

936
01:19:26,579 --> 01:19:33,044
I can see that you're good.
And that you strive for righteousness.

937
01:19:36,755 --> 01:19:40,342
So you get me
a big old Barker's Fruit basket

938
01:19:40,467 --> 01:19:43,970
with a lot of navel oranges
and the deal's yours.

939
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:49,601
I make my mark on your paper.
Here it is.

940
01:19:53,604 --> 01:19:55,064
Where?

941
01:20:07,117 --> 01:20:11,370
There. Finished.

942
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:15,416
Thank you.

943
01:20:17,543 --> 01:20:21,713
Didn't no one say
them people was Jews to me.

944
01:21:19,224 --> 01:21:20,684
George is staying.

945
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:35,614
George, darling,
why don't you leave your cellphone on?

946
01:21:35,781 --> 01:21:38,534
I've been trying to reach you.
I got him back.

947
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:40,452
And you can't believe,
it's the most bizarre thing,

948
01:21:40,577 --> 01:21:43,663
all he wanted was a fruit basket.

949
01:21:44,372 --> 01:21:46,374
Well, that's good for you.

950
01:21:47,542 --> 01:21:52,421
I know. Have you heard of a Barker's?

951
01:21:52,588 --> 01:21:54,799
Listen, we lost him.

952
01:22:02,347 --> 01:22:03,640
George, what happened?

953
01:22:06,267 --> 01:22:11,230
She didn't want the fetal monitor
and it came fast.

954
01:22:12,857 --> 01:22:13,858
I have to come to the hospital.

955
01:22:14,025 --> 01:22:15,776
You could have.

956
01:22:19,238 --> 01:22:20,572
What?

957
01:22:24,034 --> 01:22:25,785
There's nothing to do.

958
01:22:30,581 --> 01:22:31,624
Will you come get me?

959
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:36,754
No. I'm going to stay with Ashley.

960
01:22:38,881 --> 01:22:46,388
I guess you should,
you could take a cab. Bluebird Cab.

961
01:22:49,807 --> 01:22:51,934
I'm going to get back to her now.

962
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:14,455
You got the acid reflux?

963
01:23:27,926 --> 01:23:29,302
Don't you want some?

964
01:23:31,721 --> 01:23:32,680
OK.

965
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:48,987
It's funny how you're gone all the time
but you always here when I need you.

966
01:23:49,112 --> 01:23:50,321
Isn't that funny?

967
01:23:52,323 --> 01:23:53,783
Is Madeleine alright?

968
01:23:54,325 --> 01:23:55,743
She's on her way home.

969
01:23:55,868 --> 01:23:57,119
To Chicago?!

970
01:23:57,202 --> 01:23:59,204
No. Here.

971
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:07,504
Did she ask about me?
Is she too old to have babies?

972
01:24:08,087 --> 01:24:09,464
Wait a second,
that's none of my business.

973
01:24:09,631 --> 01:24:11,424
You don't have to answer that.

974
01:24:15,136 --> 01:24:16,428
Is she?

975
01:24:17,846 --> 01:24:23,852
No, no, not. I don't think she is.
We haven't really talked about it.

976
01:24:24,352 --> 01:24:28,398
Oh, you better.
For the relationship to work out.

977
01:24:29,107 --> 01:24:30,858
That's what they say, anyway.

978
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,579
I hate hospitals,

979
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,708
but it really wasn't all that scary -
all the needles and stuff.

980
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,209
It wasn't all that bad.

981
01:24:52,086 --> 01:24:54,255
I'll tell you what's
the scariest thing is to me.

982
01:24:56,382 --> 01:24:58,717
The scariest thing to me is Johnny.

983
01:25:00,093 --> 01:25:01,345
It is.

984
01:25:05,307 --> 01:25:07,308
He didn't say nothing.

985
01:25:08,101 --> 01:25:16,775
Not one word. I don't know what it is.
I think he really did want it, too.

986
01:25:18,652 --> 01:25:23,907
A boy. You know how I know?

987
01:25:25,575 --> 01:25:30,079
'Cause I heard him tell your pa
to paint the cradle brown.

988
01:25:32,248 --> 01:25:37,628
You wouldn't put a baby girl
in a brown cradle.

989
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:44,176
You just wouldn't.

990
01:25:57,271 --> 01:25:59,064
I don't know what he's thinking.

991
01:26:04,736 --> 01:26:06,654
It's not my fault.

992
01:26:06,946 --> 01:26:08,072
Course not.

993
01:26:10,575 --> 01:26:13,953
And all that time and all that stuff
I got and all those months.

994
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,163
It was just all for nothing!

995
01:26:18,082 --> 01:26:20,792
And those fucking doctors!

996
01:26:20,959 --> 01:26:26,089
They think that they know everything!
But they don't know anything.

997
01:26:36,473 --> 01:26:38,142
I don't understand.

998
01:26:38,308 --> 01:26:41,061
I don't understand
why would God let this happen?!

999
01:26:41,186 --> 01:26:50,528
Why would he. I want something good
to come out of this!

1000
01:26:57,785 --> 01:27:03,081
I mean it. I really mean it.

1001
01:27:23,058 --> 01:27:25,143
I bet I'm real pretty right now.

1002
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,359
Boy, these things
really make you think, huh?

1003
01:27:37,071 --> 01:27:42,701
You know what? I'm craving some nuts.

1004
01:27:45,036 --> 01:27:48,331
Well, I am too!
And they won't give me any.

1005
01:27:49,707 --> 01:27:52,043
You want me to go see
if I can get you some peanuts?

1006
01:27:52,168 --> 01:27:56,463
Would you? You always know what I need.

1007
01:28:00,759 --> 01:28:03,970
All want in the whole world is
for Johnny to love me

1008
01:28:04,095 --> 01:28:05,680
like he did in high school.

1009
01:28:09,892 --> 01:28:17,066
You held him, didn't you?
He was beautiful. He was perfect.

1010
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:21,570
He was.

1011
01:28:24,156 --> 01:28:25,365
He was blue.

1012
01:28:32,163 --> 01:28:34,540
You'll come back and see me tomorrow,
won't you?

1013
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:37,084
And can you all stay for the service?

1014
01:28:37,876 --> 01:28:41,380
We want to and I have to figure out-

1015
01:28:41,546 --> 01:28:46,176
I know. You got stuff
you got to get back to. I know.

1016
01:28:46,885 --> 01:28:48,636
But you'll be there in spirit.

1017
01:28:51,389 --> 01:28:52,348
I will.

1018
01:28:52,515 --> 01:28:53,641
I know.

1019
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:01,940
I don't understand, but

1020
01:29:02,107 --> 01:29:04,484
you make me feel better
about things than anybody else.

1021
01:29:04,609 --> 01:29:06,903
And you don't even do anything!

1022
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:22,167
I love you. I'm so happy that you
and Madeleine are my family.

1023
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:24,169
You too.

1024
01:29:32,176 --> 01:29:33,261
Okay.

1025
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:37,598
Bye.

1026
01:29:39,099 --> 01:29:40,684
Send her my love. Okay?

1027
01:29:41,685 --> 01:29:42,728
Yeah.

1028
01:29:49,609 --> 01:29:52,653
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry to get you out of bed.

1029
01:29:53,321 --> 01:29:54,363
Well.

1030
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:57,825
I'll call you soon. I'm really happy.

1031
01:29:58,283 --> 01:30:00,202
Well.

1032
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:08,334
I'm just so sorry
for your family's loss.

1033
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:58,532
Piece of shit. I'm gonna sell it.

1034
01:34:04,092 --> 01:34:05,552
George?

1035
01:34:11,057 --> 01:34:12,683
I'm sorry.

1036
01:34:17,104 --> 01:34:18,689
We're going home tomorrow morning.

1037
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:23,568
We are? But I haven't seen Ashley.

1038
01:34:23,693 --> 01:34:25,070
I took care of it.

1039
01:34:27,947 --> 01:34:29,449
You don't want to tell her
why I didn't go-

1040
01:34:29,574 --> 01:34:35,121
There's nothing to do. So we're going.

1041
01:34:42,836 --> 01:34:43,962
Darling, what happened?

1042
01:34:44,129 --> 01:34:45,630
Don't touch it.

1043
01:34:53,512 --> 01:34:55,097
George?

1044
01:35:58,655 --> 01:35:59,698
Mayo?

1045
01:35:59,865 --> 01:36:00,824
What?

1046
01:36:01,366 --> 01:36:02,409
You want mayonnaise on these?

1047
01:36:02,534 --> 01:36:05,662
No, I don't -
does George eat mayonnaise?

1048
01:36:05,829 --> 01:36:09,499
Lord yes. He could eat it with a spoon!

1049
01:36:14,628 --> 01:36:16,880
- You'll tell Ashley that I-
- Sure.

1050
01:36:17,464 --> 01:36:18,257
And I promise I'll write.

1051
01:36:18,382 --> 01:36:19,633
I got it.

1052
01:36:24,179 --> 01:36:27,807
She'll like that.
And don't worry about Ashley.

1053
01:36:28,224 --> 01:36:32,770
She's a firecracker.
You looking forward to the drive?

1054
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:38,901
You and George play car games?

1055
01:36:40,944 --> 01:36:45,740
You know like name the presidents
and count billboards and such as that.

1056
01:36:45,907 --> 01:36:51,245
We used to love that.
Watch out though, he's a cheat.

1057
01:37:03,131 --> 01:37:04,132
Where's George?

1058
01:37:14,725 --> 01:37:15,976
You need any help?

1059
01:37:16,352 --> 01:37:17,394
All done.

1060
01:37:23,066 --> 01:37:24,609
You got another one of those?

1061
01:37:31,282 --> 01:37:32,533
Don't tell Madeleine.

1062
01:37:37,329 --> 01:37:39,123
I guess she's gonna stay around.

1063
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,046
I hope so.

1064
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:49,882
I guess she'll find out all my faults,
sooner or later.

1065
01:37:52,385 --> 01:37:59,308
Well... She's got lovely hands.
I'll give her that.

1066
01:38:03,895 --> 01:38:06,606
But you don't have a thing wrong
with you George...

1067
01:38:09,317 --> 01:38:11,027
not a thing.

1068
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:44,779
You OK?

1069
01:39:44,946 --> 01:39:47,323
Oh! Wait a second.

1070
01:39:52,203 --> 01:39:53,663
Look what I found.

1071
01:39:53,829 --> 01:39:55,080
Hey.

1072
01:39:58,125 --> 01:39:59,960
I just remembered
I woke up this morning

1073
01:40:00,085 --> 01:40:02,421
and I rolled over
and I saw it lying under there,

1074
01:40:02,546 --> 01:40:03,505
but I was half asleep,

1075
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:07,133
so I was just sitting in the kitchen
and I remembered.

1076
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:08,885
So strange. Isn't that funny?

1077
01:40:09,218 --> 01:40:12,346
I have done some screwing in here,
I guess.

1078
01:40:19,853 --> 01:40:22,272
I never saw any of your woodworking.

1079
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:27,735
Yeah, well, it'll hold til next time,
I guess.

1080
01:40:33,366 --> 01:40:34,325
Thank you.

1081
01:41:07,147 --> 01:41:08,439
Hey.

1082
01:41:13,277 --> 01:41:14,737
Fine.

1083
01:41:16,363 --> 01:41:17,781
I know.

1084
01:41:20,033 --> 01:41:22,035
Just 'cause I want to.

1085
01:41:22,411 --> 01:41:26,039
I was waiting until after you got up.
How are you this morning?

1086
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:28,333
What's that?

1087
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:30,710
Old bird.

1088
01:41:48,977 --> 01:41:58,068
Yeah I know you're sad. I know.
It's OK. I'm right here.

1089
01:42:02,781 --> 01:42:08,369
Hey, I was thinking what do you think

1090
01:42:08,494 --> 01:42:14,375
about maybe sometime later
we could try again or what?

1091
01:42:40,107 --> 01:42:41,775
I'm so fuckin' glad we're out of here.
