She's the
first lady racer?

26
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,159
But she didn't
actually win.

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,680
She crossed the line
first. It's so exciting.

28
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,759
Not nearly as exciting
as crossing your mother.

29
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
Oh! I think we can
all ignore that.

30
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,360
Oh, what is that man doing?

31
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,120
Jackson!

32
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,520
Madam?
What did I tell you?

33
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,000
Get the camellias
out of the rain

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
and put them by the front
door before the guests arrive.

35
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,960
Furber.
Madam?

36
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,800
Salvage any of Jackson's appalling
pruning and send it to Mrs. Holborough,

37
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,719
who's kindly offered up a leg
of mutton for tonight's dinner.

38
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,479
Which you'll go
and fetch, Marion.

39
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,800
But, Mother, Reverend Burton
has asked me to drain the font.

40
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,400
My hands
are clearly full.

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,560
I'll go.

42
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,039
Uncle George has posted

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,879
the most grisly clippings of
the Valentine's Day Massacre!

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,199
Hilda.
Seven terrified men

45
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,400
cut down in a hail
of automatic gunfire!

46
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,159
Made worse by the strays that
came to lap the curdled blood.

47
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Hilda!

48
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,639
The Devil Dogs!
The Hounds of Hell!

49
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,479
The leg of lamb!

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400
Now.

51
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:02,400
Why we try and marry her off to gentry,
when plainly she'd prefer an undertaker.

52
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,520
Seating.

53
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,479
I'm putting Sarah on your left
and Phillip on your right,

54
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,639
so please try and make
an effort to be civil.

55
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
Right.

56
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,080
I shall go and brush up
on my very small talk.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,639
It might be
an awkward meal.

58
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,600
For all we know, Sarah's
grazing in greener pastures.

59
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,560
Whilst your brother sows his wild oats
in the South of France with his floozy.

60
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,600
No. We'll keep the home fires burning
until his highness wanders home.

61
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,199
Like Father did.

62
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,920
Yes, like Father did.

63
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,040
I've got news,
everybody!

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,120
You all right, sir?

65
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,360
No. Are you?

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,720
Coping, sir.

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,279
Hear, hear.
Well done.

68
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,360
Well done. They look like they're
waiting for a firing squad.

69
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,920
Can't you make them
more relaxed?

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,879
Last meal
and a cigarette, perhaps?

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,720
I can't believe it.
You'll never guess.

72
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,240
Houdini escaped the Chinese water
torture, only to die of a burst appendix.

73
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,839
How ghastly!

74
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Oh, and Mother's
got a telegram.

75
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,319
"Mr. and Mrs. Whittaker. "
Your mother.

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
What's it say, Father?

77
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,759
Perhaps your mother
should read this first.

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,759
That stupid, stupid,
stupid boy!

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,759
What's happened?
Has there been an accident?

80
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,000
It's John,
he's married that...

81
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,079
Francophile?

82
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,720
Photographer?

83
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Pharmacist?

84
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,519
And why
are you smirking?

85
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,759
Deploying a smile, dear. One member
of this family may actually be happy.

86
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't be absurd. We don't
know anything about this woman.

87
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,319
Furber!

88
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,920
Furber!

89
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,199
Oh, not again!

90
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,240
Madam.

91
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,279
Lord have mercy.

92
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,040
Mr. John is coming home
with his... With his wife.

93
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,519
Yes. Their bags have just
arrived. Congratulations, madam.

94
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,360
I'll be the judge of that.
You can clear up this mess

95
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,639
and get Cook
to send up a ham.

96
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,560
This was sent from Dover.
They'll be halfway here.

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,639
Yes, chop chop, Furber. Go
and dress the mutton as ham.

98
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,959
Very sharp, Jim.
Don't cut yourself.

99
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,759
John married
the floozy. How exciting!

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,639
<i>♪ A room with
a view and you</i>

101
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,959

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,959

103
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,079
There she blows.
Behold the country cottage.

104
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, Lord.
It's enormous.

105
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,319
So I lied about gingerbread
hedges and obese little children.

106
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,759
How hard to swim
is the moat?

107
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,879
Smoke and mirrors, darling.
Smoke and mirrors.

108
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,120
By the by, smoking, don't.
Apparently, it wilts the azaleas.

109
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,120
That makes no sense.
Speak English.

110
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,920
All will be revealed,
darling.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,319
Oh, give me back the wheel of my
car. I'm going back to Detroit.

112
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,079
How romantic!
Here they come! Oh! Furber!

113
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,920
Mr. John and his wife
are about to arrive.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,279
I can't see them.

115
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
Your tunnel vision.

116
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,360
Smile, Marion. I don't
feel like smiling.

117
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,319
You're English, dear.
Fake it.

118
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,600
The prodigal son returns
in a blaze of gravel.

119
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,800
Father! You shaved.

120
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,720
Hilda.
Welcome, madam.

121
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,920
Hilda,
you do look gorgeous.

122
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,000
It's so lovely
to see you.

123
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,879
Oh! Darling. Sorry, sorry.

124
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,759
Mother,
this is my wife, Larita.

125
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,199
Mrs. Whittaker,
the pleasure is all mine.

126
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,639
You're American.

127
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,764
And very welcome.

128
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,679
Jim Whittaker.
Lari, this is my father.

129
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,360
I fought alongside many
of your countrymen, Larita,

130
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,960
and I must say it's an honor
to have a comrade in the family.

131
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,240
Thank you. I do hope
I'm not a disappointment.

132
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,799
Far from it.
And my two little blisters.

133
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,519
Hilda and Marion.

134
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,000
Aren't you the woman
who won the Grand Prix?

135
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,279
Yes. First place,
before disqualification.

136
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,039
Apparently, you need chest
hair to change gears in Monaco.

137
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,360
I saw you in the paper. I cut
your head out. I could just die!

138
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,480
Furber, that suitcase to the
drawing room and do be careful.

139
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,600
Marion. Golly, you're not
a bit like what we imagined.

140
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:13,600
Someone older, I expect.
Awfully sorry about that.

141
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,559
Before the frostbite
sets in...

142
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,519
Yes. I'm so looking forward to getting
acquainted with the mother of my Panda.

143
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,320
You'll find me quite
uncomplicated, I'm afraid.

144
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,399
Oh! What are you doing?

145
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,919
Carrying you over
the finish line.

146
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Oh!

147
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,759
Venus de Milo,
meet my Venus Detroit.

148
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,399
Hello.

149
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,639
Mother's turned our old
nursery into a boudoir.

150
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,039
I wouldn't exactly
call it a boudoir, Hilda.

151
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,279
Marvelous. All those grubby
memories of Little Johnny.

152
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,399
We didn't even have time
to raid the hothouse.

153
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,639
I only hope we can
make you comfortable.

154
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,799
Please, don't go to any trouble.
We're only staying a few days.

155
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,039
Aren't we, Johnny?
Of course.

156
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,000
And for our
next surprise...

157
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,080
What on earth is that?

158
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,919
His Master's Voice! A wedding
gift from us to you all.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,039
How divine! You should
have got married years ago!

Come on, little blister. Twirl for me.

164
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,080
I see you're connoisseurs
of the great masters

165
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,360
Yes we avoid them
at all costs

166
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,320
Oh! A continental education. Not
all of us have been so fortunate.

167
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,639
Yes. What an emotional depiction of the
French postal service, Mrs. Whittaker.

168
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,679
Come now, Lari. Not "Mrs.
Whittaker. " It's "Mother" now.

169
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,600
Oh, I don't think we're quite
ready for that yet, darling.

170
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, since time is
so clearly against us,

171
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,480
why don't you show Larita
up to the nursery?

172
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,240
Dinner's at 8:00.

173
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,679
You didn't tell them?

174
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,960
One bombshell
at a time, darling.

175
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,240
That's not fair!
Your poor mother.

176
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,080
How long are we staying?

177
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,039
A few days?

178
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,000
I shoulder the shortcomings
of this family for generations

179
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,440
and what do I get in return?
A few days. And look at her.

180
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,320
What am I supposed to do
with the bauble of a woman?

181
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,360
Hang her?
I think she's splendid.

182
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,159
Oh, do you, Hilda?
Well, we can all relax.

183
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,480
She's not what I expected.

184
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,840
She's exactly what I expected.

185
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,960
Surely not exactly?
She wasn't drunk.

186
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,080
Very funny, Jim. Reduce
this to the burlesque.

187
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,600
She looks so expensive!

188
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,000
Very.

189
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,279
I like her.
Yes, Jim.

190
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,120
We all know
what you like.

191
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,440
Mother!

192
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,320
Hmm. We have all been
sent to our wombs.

193
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,840
And so toasty.

194
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,559
Economics in action.

195
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,360
She keeps half the house
closed to save on heating.

196
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,759
Well, that explains
the frosty reception.

197
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,840
Well, darling.
Let me warm you up.

198
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Well?

199
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,080
She's lovely, John.
I'm very proud of you.

200
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,440
Thanks, Father.

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,240
John.

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,919
How long is a few days?

203
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,279
Mother, Larita and I would
like to find a home in London.

204
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,000
But this is your home.

205
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,720
A home of their own.

206
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,159
But...

207
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,200
But, Panda,
we need you here.

208
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,320
Since you went off on your
quick jaunt around the Riviera,

209
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,240
we've had to let go
of six more people.

210
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,759
Mother, if you'd just listened to
me and taken on some machinery...

211
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:01,440
Wouldn't that be a good idea? I could
run the entire estate single-handedly.

212
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,080
Congratulations on your
insight and your spontaneity.

213
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,519
Sarah and Phillip
are coming to dinner tonight,

214
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,399
and I have got a table plan that will
take the League of Nations to unravel.

215
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,960
Tonight?
That's absolutely splendid!

216
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,480
Don't be so fickle
in your affections, John.

217
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,440
Sarah might not be as
accommodating as you expect.

218
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,840
Codswallop.
She'll be delighted.

219
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,799
If Mother was so desperate
for her hand in marriage,

220
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,279
she should have
asked for it herself.

221
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,879
Strange as it may seem,
I agree with your sister.

222
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,440
I think you're wrong.

223
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,240
On certain things, yes.

224
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,240
Call her.

225
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Really?
Really.

226
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,639
Really!

227
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,840
If Edgar were here,
he'd do the manly thing.

228
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,279
What? Run away?

229
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,080
Here they come!

230
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,039
And the checkered flag
goes to...

231
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,840
Fast work, John.

232
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,000
I should have
written you, Sarah,

233
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,240
but it all happened so fast,
I didn't know where I was.

234
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
In Larita's arms,
it seems.

235
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,519
Please don't be disappointed.

236
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,159
Of course I'm disappointed,

237
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,600
but tell me you're happy, and
I'll tell you you're forgiven.

238
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,600
You're the top. You're
Mahatma Gandhi. You're the top.

239
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,320
Panda, don't break out
the brandy just yet.

240
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,960
To hell we're not.

241
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,960
Have I missed something?

242
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,240
Let
sleeping cows stand.

243
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Oh, you plonker!

244
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,559
Rule one,
push sleeping cow.

245
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,919
Rule two,
get out of the way.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,240
Rule three,
remember rule two.

247
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,559
Sarah! It's so
lovely to see you.

248
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,919
I hear your poor father
is not having a good day.

249
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,360
I'm afraid not.
He sends his love.

250
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,960
You are a jolly good sport, turning
up like this. That's all I can say.

251
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,639
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Larita is such a pretty name.

252
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,879
Yes. Excellent
for musical comedy.

253
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,639
Hilda!
Phillip,

254
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,919
I hear the cow is in a
terrible way. I've sent flowers.

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,360
And did she eat them?
Touche!

256
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,320
Good evening
to you all.

257
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,600
Nobody told me
tonight was fancy dress!

258
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,639
Then why have you come
as the village idiot?

259
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,480
I think I'm snagged.

260
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,159
Let me
help you with that.

261
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,960
Holy mother!

262
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,799
Panda?

263
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,840
You're forgiven,
tenfold.

264
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,320
Sarah Hurst, I'd like
to introduce my wife,

265
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,480
Larita Whittaker.

266
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,399
Gosh, I do like
the sound of that.

267
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,960
Sarah, finally.

268
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,080
Johnny talks about you
constantly.

269
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,000
How very annoying for you.

270
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,759
I hope we can be friends.

271
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,799
We already are.
Congratulations.

272
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,200
And I'd like
to be friends, too.

273
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,879
Larita,
my tiresome brother...

274
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,720
The dishonorable
Phillip Hurst.

275
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,240
Charmed, my dear lady.
Indeed.

276
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,799
Phillip,
won't you escort me in?

277
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,159
Of course, my beautiful
little Sausage Fingers.

278
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, that's whet my appetite.
Shall we adjourn to the dining room?

279
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,759
And toast my beautiful bride.

280
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Yes, John.

281
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,799
Had we known there was
to be a wedding reception,

282
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,360
we could have all
lashed out on taffeta.

283
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,840
She's a lot like drowning, quite
pleasant once you stop struggling.

284
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,039
So, tell me, John. Was Larita's
family able to attend the wedding?

285
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,960
Phillip!

286
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,240
More cabbage, madam?
No, thank you.

287
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,519
There's lots to do, Larita.
You ride, don't you?

288
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,519
Boats, cars or planes?

289
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,320
No, horses, silly.

290
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,080
Ah, yes, horses.

291
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,639
Faulty steering
and unreliable brakes.

292
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,159
I'm stealing that
for Stirrup Cup!

293
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,399
Stirrup what?
Cup.

294
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,879
Every November, Phillip and
Sarah's family host the hunt.

295
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,679
Wait till you meet their father,
Lord Hurst. He's terrific.

296
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,840
And Lady Hurst?

297
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,880
Was terrific
until she

298
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
stopped.

299
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,519
Stopped what?
Living.

300
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,960
Oh. I'm very sorry
to hear that.

301
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,960
Between Father's polio and
Phillip's mania for tipping cows...

302
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,920
Can we please just
drop the cows?

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,559
I think we'll give the fox
a break this year.

304
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,039
No hunt?

305
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,079
Mrs. Winston gave me
her saddle. I've had a wax.

306
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,680
Your father and I conspired to
make John the master of the hunt.

307
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,799
People come from far and wide. It's
such a shame to disappoint them.

308
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,319
Very thoughtful, Mother.

309
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,319
You do hunt,
I take it, Larita?

310
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,119
Hypocrites, gossips
or defenseless animals?

311
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,759
Bravo!

312
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,559
You wouldn't get her
to the start, I'm afraid.

313
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,480
We have another conscientious
objector, Father.

314
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,799
Company!

315
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,920
Do you object to the circus
or the slaughter, Major?

316
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,519
I support Sheppard's
position on pacifism.

317
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,759
Good for you.

318
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,119
So, when does
the carnage begin?

319
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,400
After the War Widows' Revue,
but before the craft fair,

320
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,000
in between the dog show
and the shoot.

321
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,759
And don't forget
the highlight.

322
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,759
Mother's Christmas dance is
the hot ticket of the season.

323
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,079
She's ordered the most
exquisite Japanese lanterns.

324
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,119
From Japan?

325
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,920
No, Fortnum & Mason's.

326
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,839
Yes. Prepare
for a whirlwind, Larita.

327
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,160
I'm breathless already.

328
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I won't make it to Christmas.
You won't need to.

329
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,599
I won't make it to breakfast.
What were we just eating?

330
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,759
The lumpy gray
and beige concoction?

331
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,799
Yes. That's the word I
was looking for, "greige. "

332
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,079
Absolutely no idea, but it
is the specialty of the house.

333
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,599
Incoming! Have you met my
namesake? He's very good in bed.

334
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,079
They'll hear you.

335
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,279
I don't care.
I do.

336
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,799
Look, I know we need the heat,
but please don't smoke in here.

337
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,720
Mother's clairvoyant
about these things.

338
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,240
She loathes me, Johnny.

339
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,839
I'm a gold-digger burrowing in
from the land of opportunists.

340
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,319
Your father's an
interesting study, though.

341
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:13,119
Quietly sardonic.
I like that in a man.

342
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,920
A fact that won't earn you many
brownie points under this roof.

343
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,480
After the armistice, Father
didn't come straight home.

344
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,319
He caroused around France and
Italy, drinking, having affairs.

345
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,680
A lot of men did similar.
Couldn't settle down.

346
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,319
Why didn't she
go after him?

347
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,680
A question of pride.

348
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,240
He finally just
wandered home.

349
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,599
It's still a bit of a sore point.
We try not to speak about it,

350
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,400
except in public.

351
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,359
You see, she feels she's
missed out on something.

352
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,920
Which means, of course, she's
missed out on everything.

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,319
Exactly. The war robbed her
of all her expectations.

354
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,880
She takes one look
at a woman like you...

355
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,039
The harlot stealing
into the nursery...

356
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,000
The delicious concubine

357
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,960
with the delectable ears,

358
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,359
nose,

359
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,519
neck.

360
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,359
I could just eat you.

361
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,000
After that meal,
I'm not surprised.

362
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,640
<i>♪ I'm mad about the boy ♪</i>

363
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,279
Dear Lord, thank you for bringing
John and his floozy home safely.

364
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,119
<i>John.</i>

365
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,759
Why is Larita
always so late?

366
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,559
You can't hurry
perfection.

367
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,480
Edgar was never
late for a meal.

368
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,480
Well,
he's missed a few lately.

369
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,960
Good morning. How are we all
on this glorious day?

370
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,559
There she is.

371
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,960
Morning, darling.

372
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,559
What would Madam
like for breakfast?

373
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,839
I think Madam will get more
sustenance from a kipper.

374
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,680
But it won't be
as much fun.

375
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,000
Aren't you riding with us?

376
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,000
Darling, I think
it's about high time

377
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,000
that your mother and I have
an intimate tete-a-tete.

378
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,359
Just us girls.

379
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,279
Lovely.
Mmm. What a frightening thought.

380
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,759
Two hemispheres under one roof.

381
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,079
Papua New Guinea,
India, the Argentine.

382
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,680
I may not have traveled,
but the world has come to me.

383
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,599
Are you coming down
with something?

384
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,559
Pollen, but if I hold
my breath long enough...

385
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,039
How peculiar.

386
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,680
Which is why we should
get to know one another.

387
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,799
Where does
one start?

388
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,359
Shall I
make headway?

389
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
I was born in Detroit. My
father worked in the steel plant.

390
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,200
He was one of the first
lured over to Henry Ford.

391
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,359
Ah. Hence the love
of motoring?

392
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,720
Yes, but
I also love animals.

393
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,160
I am a city girl.
I take chickens to the vet.

394
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,880
You can't be squeamish about livestock
now that you are living in the country.

395
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,119
Which was never
my intention.

396
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,519
I was happily carving out a niche
for myself on the race circuit,

397
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,640
when I was unexpectedly flagged
down by someone irresistible.

398
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,960
Remarrying was the farthest
thing from my mind.

399
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,839
I see.

400
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,640
May I ask...

401
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,279
Dead, unfortunately.
No children.

402
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Oh.

403
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,160
How disappointing for you.

404
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,480
Still, he provided well,
though?

405
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,759
Yes, yes, but there were a lot of
hidden costs associated with his passing.

406
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,000
That beautiful motorcar. Surely
you must have independent means?

407
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,720
Mrs. Whittaker, I'm more than
happy to discuss my means,

408
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,000
but I think you'll be
a tad disappointed.

409
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,200
The car is my sole
source of income,

410
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,160
which makes living in London
an imperative.

411
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,240
But what will John
do in the city?

412
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,359
Work. It's not uncommon.

413
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,880
John was brought up
in the country, Larita.

414
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,079
Where will he work?

415
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,960
Chalk Farm, perhaps?
Or St. Martin's-in-the-Fields?

416
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,920
I know this is not perfect, so that's
why I'm asking for your guidance.

417
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,279
So, please, how can I make
this pleasant for everybody?

418
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,400
Well, wartime experience dictates
that you keep your head down

419
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,279
and you fit in
as well as you can.

420
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,000
<i>Oh, there's a war on?
Oh, no.</i>

421
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,599
Not necessarily.

422
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,720
Australian mimosa.

423
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,680
Mmm. Beautiful.

424
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,400
Oh!

425
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,319
And then the British troops
opened fire.

426
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,079
How grisly!

427
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,599
How'd it go, Mother?

428
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, marvelous!

429
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,559
Marvelous.

430
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:21,400
I fear storm clouds
are gathering, Mrs. Whit.

431
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,559
Stop being maudlin, Father.
It's the future.

432
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,799
Spanner!

433
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,440
Father, allow me to introduce
Panda's new chauffeuse,

434
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,559
lovely la-la-Larita.

435
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,039
Watch it, Phillip.

436
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,279
My son is prone to fabrication,
but I can see on this occasion

437
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,039
he has been perfectly
frank, Mrs. Whittaker.

438
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,160
Yes, that's right.
There are two of us now.

439
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,960
No shortage of wits
around here anymore.

440
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,799
Okay, stand back!
I give you the future!

441
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,240
All right, John.
You can take my baby out for a spin.

442
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,720
Allergies. She inflates
like a puffer fish.

443
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,079
You just want to squeeze her
until she pops.

444
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,440

445

449
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,279
The missus is a bit
trigger-happy this week.

450
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,200
Bleeding tinnitus
is killing me.

451
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,079
Well, I like the new Mrs. Whit. Reminds
me of the old one before the war.

452
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,359
Only more reasonable. You can
tell she's run her own household.

453
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,599
Be silent.

454
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,200
Good morning, Furber,
Jackson, Millie and...

455
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,000
Cook, I can't call you
a verb. Your name?

456
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,119
Beatrice.

457
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,960
All right, all right,
it's Doris. Sorry, madam.

458
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,559
Always wanted to be
called Beatrice.

459
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,079
Well, Beatrice, would you mind if
I helped myself in the mornings?

460
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,240
I fear I shall be rising
later and later.

461
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,000
Well, if it pleases,
Mrs. Whit...

462
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,720
The point of the bell?

463
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:38,240
When I ring it, you come to
me. Not the other way round.

464
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,759
Larita. May I have a word? Mmm.

465
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,519
Come along.

466
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:50,200
Would you please refrain
from chatting to the staff?

467
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,599
It's chore enough trying to
keep this motley crew together.

468
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,559
I had a brilliant French maid in
Paris. Perhaps I should send for her?

469
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,119
Thank you, no.

470
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,359
I'd prefer to keep English the
first language in this household.

471
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,519
Oh.

472
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
Ah, there you are.

473
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,119
I say. Anyone for tennis?

474
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,799
Yes. You!

475
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,240
John, Shackleton wouldn't
let a dog out today.

476
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:15,680
The fog has lifted and
Whittakers don't do winter.

477
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,279
You go ahead, darling.
I'll play with myself.

478
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,519
No, really.
I'm a lot of fun.

479
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,119
Ooh...

480
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,799
John!
It's brass monkeys out here.

481
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,559
Oh!

482
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,359
Day one of the Antarctic Open.
Mister Whittaker to serve.

483
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,200
Hole in one!
Deuce.

484
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,640
I see your pair of deuces,
and I raise you a tenner.

<i>The Titanic could

486
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,279
Sarah, you're an embarrassment
to the Hurst family name.

487
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,640
I'm going to have you killed.

488
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,559
Good God! What's wrong
with you? No! Stop now!

489
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,519
You must stop!
Everybody, listen!

490
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,799
Shoot the court jester!

491
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,400
Enough!

492
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,880
Nice backhand.

493
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,559
Was that
a backhand compliment?

494
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,759

The fillies are lining up.

500
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,720
Miss Hilda Whittaker looking most
fetching in her feedbag and bridle.

501
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,359
One woman's heaven...

502
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,279
She's absolutely beautiful.

503
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,359
Broken, tarnished
and completely useless,

504
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,519
thing's guaranteed to
keep my wife at bay.

505
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,079
May I?

506
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,519
If you don't mind
getting your hands dirty.

507
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,559
In Detroit, what we lack in
dirt, we make up for in filth.

508
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,359
Your first husband from
that neck of the woods?

509
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,200
Oh, well.
Word gets about.

510
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,240
Where is he now?

511
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,480
Dead.

512
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,480
Cancer.

513
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,400
He was a fair bit
older than me.

514
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,079
I spent a while playing the un-merry
widow, but the black wore thin.

515
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,359
You didn't care for him,
I gather?

516
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,400
Oh, I cared too much.

517
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,400
Life was just such an unpleasant
experience for the man, I...

518
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,559
I'd be a liar to say I wasn't
glad when he was relieved of it.

519
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,359
God is a comedian
playing to an audience

520
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,119
too afraid to laugh

521
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,480
When were you
last in France?

522
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,799
Just after the war.

523
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,519
On a personal reconnaissance,
trying to ascertain

524
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,759
what exactly all those fine
young men had died for.

525
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,559
Apparently, I'm of the
romantic Lost Generation.

526
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,960
What did you lose?

527
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,920
I'm not sure.

528
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,240
Hello, hello.

529
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,240
Who is the tiny tank?

530
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:01,319
Who's a pretty little
cheeky chorizo?

531
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:05,359
On bended knees, please
come and play with me.

532
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,359
Johnny, dear, you know
how much I love you,

533
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,559
so please, try to take this
in the best possible light.

534
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,440
I'm getting a machine gun and
mowing down your entire family.

535
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,720
Mmm. Well, that's fairly
disappointing.

536
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,839
I thought at least you and
Father were getting along.

537
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,000
Hmm. Yes, I might
spare the menfolk.

538
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,160
But it's awfully dispiriting. We
have absolutely no privacy here.

539
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,599
I never needed any privacy
before. This is my home.

540
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,559
Well, it's not mine,
and I very much want one.

541
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,640
<i>♪ We're all alone,
no chaperone</i>

542
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,200
<i>♪ Can get our number</i>

543
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,200
<i>♪ The world's a-slumber,

544
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,279
Timing is everything,
you little brute.

545
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,000
Come. Umpire at least.
Phillip is pining for you.

546
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,799
If I knew
you played tennis,

547
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,799
I never would have signed
that marriage certificate.

548
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,400
Not a bad day for it.

549
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,759
Reading.

550
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,079
My fiance, Edgar, was
always hiding behind books.

551
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,519
Marion, you're needed on the tennis
court. John was just asking after you.

552
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,240
Would you like to see
a photo of him, my Edgar?

553
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,759
Poppy!

554
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,279
That's Enrico Caruso.

555
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,400
Who's dead, I know that. But if
you ignore the nose and the mouth

556
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:41,920
and the ears, there's
a striking resemblance.

557
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,839
I don't actually have
a picture of Edgar.

558
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,440
Well, mustn't keep you.

559
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,160
No, no. Of course.

560
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,480
Looking forward to getting
stuck in to a good book.

561
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,960
Poppy!

562
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,759
You haven't seen
the beast, have you?

563
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,880
The dog?

564
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,319
Nope. I haven't.

565
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,880
Poppy!

566
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,199
Oh!

567
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,320
Oh, poor, poor Poppy.
I'm so sorry.

568
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,079
Larita!

569
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,960
I've been sent in
to badger you.

570
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,639
Please, please help us
make up doubles.

571
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,519
Hilda, I can't. I'm only good
for the cocktails between sets.

572
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,239
We're between sets now.

573
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,719
Hilda, you can't possibly
want me on court.

574
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,320
Phillip! Go get him.

575
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,679
Poppy!

576
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,719
Poppy!

577
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,159
Poppy!

578
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,800
What are you doing?
Reading.

579
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,480
<i>Sodom and Gomorrah,
A Biblical Story.</i>

580
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,920
Who gave you
this filth?

581
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,519
Go and find the dog!

582
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,239
Larita!

583
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,199
Please refrain from giving my
daughter pornographic literature.

584
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,400
Yes, yes, of course.

585
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,239
Oh, and I volunteered
you and Hilda

586
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,199
<i>to perform the dance of The Dying
Swan for the War Widows' Revue.</i>

587
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,880
We're short on numbers.

588
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,039
Lovely.
Anything to help.

589
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,960
Have you seen the dog?

590
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:25,880
No. Not recently.

591
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,840
Probably out seizing the
sunshine like everyone else.

592
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
Poppy!

593
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,400
Furber!

594
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,519
Oh!

595
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,719
Oh, it's you, madam.
I'm sorry.

596
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,360
Can I get you anything?

597
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:50,079
A shovel.

598
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,440
Shovel. Of course.

599
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,119
Go and get Phillip
a hot toddy.

600
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,360
Phillip. You look so...

601
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,159
So... So...

602
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,039
The suspense
is killing me.

603
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,519
Poppy!

604
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,760
Oh. Sorry.
It's fine.

605
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,119
Your brother is such
a sharply honed twit.

606
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,639
Where is our beautiful
cougar hiding?

607
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,880
Under a book, I expect. I wish
she wouldn't slack indoors so much.

608
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:30,760
Some people would kill
to be indoors with Larita.

609
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,920
She isn't built
the same as us.

610
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,199
Still,
it is annoying, though.

611
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,760
You're such a sport,
always ready for anything.

612
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:44,800
I haven't got Lari's beauty
or charm or intelligence.

613
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,039
She is clever,
isn't she?

614
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,119
Mmm.

615
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Clever and bored.

616
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,719
I don't understand it. I'm not bored.
You're not bored. Nobody else is bored.

617
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,360
Your father is,
out of his mind.

618
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,679
Yeah.
Father was born bored.

619
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
Hmm.

620
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,800
If only she made
an effort to play along.

621
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,519
Stop being
so torturous, Panda.

622
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,119
You had her playing charades
last night. What more do you want?

623
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,400
John!
Hmm?

624
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,000
John?

625
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,559
To tell the truth, I never really
liked her. Crabby, snappy little bitch.

626
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,320
I didn't like
the dog much, either.

627
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,519
Poor Poppy.
Casualty of war.

628
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,280
If I may be
so bold, madam?

629
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,840
These people ride horses,
lots of horses.

630
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,880
It would be advantageous
to do the same.

631
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,519
And I thought Detroit
was a tough town.

632
00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:00,760
<i>♪ You do something to me</i>

633
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:08,519
<i>♪ Something that simply
mystifies me</i>

634
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,960
Has your horse

635
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,119
<i>♪ You have the power

636
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,320
Oh, John,
don't hurt it.

637
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,559
Far from it, we've got a hunt coming up.

638
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,159
Poor little mite
needs a head start.

639
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:35,079
Oh.
Go on, run.

640
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,719
So much to learn
about each other.

641
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,239
My curriculum vitae.

642
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,719
The brook is the border
of Sarah's property.

643
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,360
Mother always imagined we'd
join forces and invade Surrey.

644
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,280
And how about those
foot soldiers on high?

645
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,840
I say, that's Davis,
Lord Hurst's man.

646
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,079
And there's Lord Hurst.

647
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,360
Closely followed by
my mother-in-law.

648
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,639
I wonder what the devil
they're surveying?

649
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,599
Are you disappointed
you didn't marry Sarah?

650
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:15,840
Of course not.

651
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,519
We've seen each other naked
since we were one.

652
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,280
She's part of the...

653
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,840
The scenery.

654
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,280
You can hack it a little
while longer, can't you?

655
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,400
How long is a little? And
don't say two weeks again.

656
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,840
Well, there's the War Widows'
Revue, the craft fair,

657
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,480
the hunt.
The hunt.

658
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,000
The memorial service.

659
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,400
What memorial service?

660
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,400
Friends,
we are gathered here today

661
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,400
in remembrance
of our missing friend, Poppy.

662
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,159
Oh, Poppy.

663
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:54,639
Wherever you have chosen
to sow your seeds,

664
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,519
we pray that
you are blooming.

665
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,280
We pray that you have
gone to a better place.

666
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,480
Shame we don't know exactly
where that place is.

667
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,880
Anyway, now for a eulogy from
Emily Dickinson, queen of mirth.

668
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,599
"Because I could not
stop for Death

669
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,760
"He kindly stopped for me

670
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,679
"The carriage held but just
ourselves And Immortality... "

671
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,760
Or maybe the carriage didn't stop
and that's how he got squished.

672
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,920
Scraped off the road
and put in a sausage...

673
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,159
Oh, Hilda!

674
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,320
Thank you, Mr. Gribble.

675
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,760
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

676
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,639
behold Reverend Burton

677
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:51,280
and Marion Whittaker as
they reach for the scissors

678
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,800
<i>in Samson and Delilah.</i>

679
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,559
Hark!
I hear my husband snore!

680
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,159
What the hell
happened to Delilah?

681
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,519
Looks like a sack
full of oranges.

682
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,559
I'll creep forth on padded foot and
relieve him of his ample follicles.

683
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:47,360
How hilarious!

684
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,559
It's meant to be a tragedy.

685
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,920
Then you succeeded
beyond your wildest dreams.

686
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,840
Your father
seems to have a fan.

687
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,440
Don't read
too much into it.

688
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,719
She was a godsend
during Mother's last months.

689
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,519
Sometimes I wonder where they
would be without each other.

690
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,119
Marion, my ample follicles
are in dire need of a trim.

691
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,199
I wouldn't taunt the artistes, my
little dying swans. You're on next.

692
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,119
Mother, I've encouraged
my girls to undertake

693
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,880
something a little more
contemporary.

694
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,880
Yes, Hilda and I seem to
have a talent for the can-can.

695
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,159
The traditional can-can,
performed without underwear?

696
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,239
Phillip.

697
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,679
Anything for you, Phillip.

698
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,599
Mmm.
Yes, anything.

699
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:27,599
That will raise a bit more
than money for the war widows.

700
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,880
I'm doubling
my donation.

701
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,280
Pinkie.

702
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,719
Fans at the ready,
gentlemen.

703
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,039
All the way
from gay Paris,

704
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,039
I give you
Miss Hilda Whittaker

705
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:45,239
and, for her debut
performance, Mrs. John Whittaker

706
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,519
doing the can-can!

707
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,039
Is it my imagination, or is your
daughter dancing without her scanties?

708
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,599
Ow!

709
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:15,400
Bravo!

710
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,559
It's not Lari's fault.

711
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:21,719
But she said
it was traditional.

712
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,159
Phillip said it, not Larita.
And it was a joke.

713
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,519
Everyone understood that except
Nelly No Knickers over here.

714
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,599
Hilda isn't as experienced
as your wife, John. No one is.

715
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:33,840
If you're not prepared to have a
straight talk to her, then I certainly am.

716
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,760
Don't be ridiculous, Marion.
You'll lose a finger.

717
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,599
Lord Hurst will never
speak to me again.

718
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,000
Oh, rubbish. You two
are as thick as thieves.

719
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,679
I saw you together with the
surveyors in the back fields.

720
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,519
Preparing the jumps
for the hunt!

721
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,280
I'm completely humiliated.
I'll never get a husband now.

722
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,760
After tonight, I'd have thought
they'd be lining up round the block.

723
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,079
John! I hate her! Hate, hate, hate her!

724
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,159
The advance notices are
sensational, Mrs. John.

725
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,239
Is it my imagination or is the cutlery
particularly deafening this evening?

726
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,840
I don't know how many times I have
to say this, Hilda. I am sorry.

727
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:19,559
That's easy
for you to say.

728
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,079
It's surprisingly hard
to be easy.

729
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,360
You're smiling, Jim.

730
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,840
God forbid,
the wind might change.

731
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,800
Hilda, if I had any inkling that you
were going to take me seriously...

732
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,400
You could have made an
effort to enjoy it less.

733
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,199
Well, I had my underpants on.
I was having a grand time.

734
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:42,559
It's not fair!

735
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,960
You've got two husbands,
and I've had none.

736
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,920
Well, technically,
I have one.

737
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,400
But you've had two.

738
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,039
Well, I've had two shoes, and
that's a great deal more practical.

739
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:55,320
I dare say, you've worn
down more soles than that.

740
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,840
John.

741
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,320
Marion, Larita's first husband died
of cancer. Stop being so callous.

742
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,079
Come now, John. I'm sure
Marion can appreciate the pain

743
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,800
of watching a loved one
slip through her fingers.

744
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:12,400
She's scandalous!

745
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:16,000
You should hear what they're
saying about her in the village.

746
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,039
Well, let's stop those
wagging tongues, shall we?

747
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,920
Is it true you've had
as many lovers as they say?

748
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:26,880
Of course it's not true,
Mrs. Whittaker.

749
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,360
Hardly any of them
actually loved me.

750
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,440
Hmm.

751
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,639
Well, that was uncalled for. I
realize it was a joke, but still...

752
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:38,639
You threw me to
the wolves in there.

753
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:41,480
Come now, Marion hardly
constitutes wolves.

754
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:45,360
All right, you threw me to the
voles. Either way, you abandoned me.

755
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,800
Your sisters need
to be restrained.

756
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,280
Restrained?

757
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,119
Hilda breaks loose once and
she's almost institutionalized.

758
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:55,159
And poor old Marion, Edgar
drops by for a cup of sugar

759
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:57,480
and Mother has his name
engraved on the family crypt.

760
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:59,639
I mean, I'm sorry,
but it really is very funny.

761
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:01,079
Hilarious.

762
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:03,000
Welcome to
the petrified circus.

763
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:06,280
Meet the resident contortionist
who can't bend any further.

764
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,719
Then stop. Be yourself.
Let them live in your spell.

765
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,360
<i>♪ You do that voodoo
that you do so well ♪</i>

766
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:17,519
You're right,
of course.

767
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,480
I'm a hypocrite, pretending
to be someone I'm not,

768
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,159
especially since
it isn't working.

769
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,159
What the devil has
that dog dug up?

770
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:32,599
Pilot, what
have you got there?

771
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,119
How could you not tell us?

772
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,519
Marion, it was an accident. I
am walking on eggshells here,

773
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:42,679
and I believe I panicked.

774
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,119
And once again,
I'm very, very sorry.

775
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,639
Well, how could you do it?
Well, how could you?

776
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,800
Well, I imagine she bent her legs
and lowered her full body weight

777
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,039
onto the Chihuahua that
was hiding beneath her.

778
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,440
Marion, please.

779
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,000
John, did you have
anything to do with this?

780
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,920
No. No, I was the sole
perpetrator of Poppy's demise,

781
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,159
and ever since I have
been wracked with guilt.

782
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,400
Please, please, please
let me buy you a new dog.

783
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,679
Oh, God!

784
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,920
You might buy your loved
ones in the United States,

785
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,519
but you can't
in the United Kingdom.

786
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,079
How unfortunate.

787
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:24,920
You could at least
show some remorse.

788
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,840
Oh, I am full
of remorse.

789
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,840
I just refuse to invest in amateur
theatrics to convince you of my sincerity.

790
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,400
That's not how I came off
the assembly line.

791
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,880
I'm sorry,
I can't change.

792
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:40,400
Not for you.
Not for anybody, anymore.

793
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,239
And I wouldn't want her
any other way. So...

794
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:51,960
Madam, the dog.

795
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,920
Stay back. Stay back.

796
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,039
I knew it the second I laid
eyes on her. She's a killer.

797
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,159
She sat on poor
Poppy deliberately.

798
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:06,760
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Of course she didn't.

799
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,679
My brother has married a dog
murderer. She should be put down.

800
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,400
Put through a divorce court.

801
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,199
The Lord does not
sanction divorce.

802
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,639
The Lord is almighty, Marion. He
can sanction anything he likes.

803
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:20,639
I say the sooner
they move out, the better.

804
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:22,119
They move out?

805
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:26,519
John isn't going anywhere.
Watch and learn.

806
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,239
It's so unfair. Why can't
I have a room like this?

807
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,039
I could die of envy.

808
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,320
Laying to rest
this tragic incident,

809
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,800
we've had this splendid set of rooms
made over for you, haven't we, Jim?

810
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,480
Yes. My wife would
like you to rest in peace.

811
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,760
And I've even had an old friend of
Johnny's brought down from the attic.

812
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,760
<i>Old Faithful Awaits
His Master's Return.</i>

813
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,159
I used to sleep under
that silly painting.

814
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,360
That's very comforting, I'm sure,
but we're expected back in Mayfair.

815
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,639
But these are the largest
rooms in the house.

816
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,039
You'll find nothing
like it in London.

817
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,519
She has a point.
She always does.

818
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:15,920
Sometimes I don't know
why you ever did wander home.

819
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,320
And miss all the fun?

820
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,880
Cook would like to inform you,
Mrs. Whittaker, the bird is stuffed.

821
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,239
Oh.

822
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:24,519
What bird? Hmm?

823
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:27,719
Thursdays is bubble and squeak.
I hadn't made any arrangements.

824
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,199
Oh, but I have!

825
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:39,840
In appreciation of your understanding,
and now for that delicious double bed.

826
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,360
We'll think of you
every time we use it.

827
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:52,199
Darling, what exactly
are we celebrating?

828
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,559
Thanksgiving.

829
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:55,320
Thanks for what, hmm?

830
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,679
The annihilation of an entire
indigenous people.

831
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,199
A loving union
of two great cultures.

832
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,559
Just like us.

833
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:05,199
How transcontinental.

834
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,840
I can't believe you got
access to the kitchen.

835
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,159
Beatrice did put up quite a fight,
but technically I outrank her.

836
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:11,679
Who's Beatrice?

837
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,079
Your cook.

838
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:16,239
Or now my undercook, since
I'm qualified cordon bleu.

839
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,000
That's a degree.

840
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,199
Furber, Furber, Furber.

841
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,159
Can you take the vegetables down to
the kitchen and tell Cook to cook them.

842
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:28,360
No, Furber, thank you. I think
I'll surprise my alimentary canal.

843
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,760
Well, Mother, if you don't mind, I think
I'm going to eat my meal before it gets cold.

844
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,920
Furber. I've changed my mind.
Bring it back.

845
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,360
Me, too.

846
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,400
Gobble, gobble.

847
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,360
Yes.

848
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,920
Here's a tip, Hilda. A sure way to
a man's heart is through his stomach.

849
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,039
Or his mother.

850
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,519
Larita, look, I've found
another likeness of Edgar.

851
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:03,719
Marion,
this is Fatty Arbuckle.

852
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:05,360
Who's in jail,
I know that,

853
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,320
but if you cut out his cheeks
and give him a bald patch,

854
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,199
there's a striking
resemblance.

855
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:14,440
Edgar's away on a trip.
He's across the pond,

856
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:18,039
sowing his wild oats
or something agricultural.

857
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:20,960
She's good,
I'll give her that.

858
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:23,000
I think you're overreacting.

859
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,079
Lari. Lari!

860
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,719
Not the vase,
not the vase!

861
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,480
<i>Taking the corn cockle
buds and bee-kissed roses</i>

862
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:41,719
<i>roughly in his
calloused hands,</i>

863
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,840
<i>his hot moist tulip exploded
in her river of delights...</i>

864
00:52:58,559 --> 00:52:59,599
Larita?

865
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:04,199
Early Christmas present.
For you, darling.

866
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,760
The mind boggles.

867
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,400
Well, it's... It's...
It's magnificent.

868
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,519
It's monstrous!

869
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:18,599
It's me.

870
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:22,360
I posed for a young Spaniard.
Don't you absolutely adore it?

871
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,840
Very expressive, darling, but
I can't quite see you in it.

872
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,039
Well, you can see everything else!

873
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,719
You actually took your clothes
off in front of a total stranger?

874
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,840
Don't be a buffoon, Marion. Of
course she took her clothes off.

875
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,159
I think it's unholy.
To be honest, Lari,

876
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:36,480
I'm not sure I approve
of you being nude.

877
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,000
You know, without...
Without me.

878
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,639
Extraordinary.

879
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,320
What exactly are you
hoping to achieve?

880
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,719
I'm just trying to get into
the swing of things, Mother.

881
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,480
Marvelous!

882
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,639
Well, then, you'll be riding
in the hunt with us, won't you?

883
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,400
Well, I might be persuaded
if the painting stays.

884
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,320
Hunt.
Paint.

885
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,639
Hunt.

886
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,599
Very well.

887
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,559
Hunt.

888
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,880
View, hello.

889
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:21,000
Hello, everyone.
Good to see you.

890
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,360
Richard.

891
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,920
Morning, Jim. After
generations of false starts,

892
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,760
we finally managed
to combine our cavalry.

893
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,719
Congratulations. A marriage
of minor convenience.

894
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,760
You'll be fine,
I promise.

895
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,480
Now, remember, the second you have the
Holborough boy's eye, flirt outrageously.

896
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,239
But Warwick Holborough has
ears like the Cambridge Cup!

897
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,199
And Phillip's the prize.

898
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,360
Now, if you want a man's
attention, ignore him.

899
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:57,000
Warwick the Wing Nut
and Sausage Fingers.

900
00:54:57,639 --> 00:55:01,480
What a handsome couple. They'll
have puppies, not children.

901
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,719
Wait.

902
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,599
There's something
I need to say.

903
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,360
I see you, you're wasted here.

904
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:15,679
When the time comes,
give me a ring.

905
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:19,000
If I could find your neck,
Phillip, I'd wring it.

906
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:21,239
Larita's making
sheep's eyes at Phillip.

907
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,079
She's a Venus de flytrap!

908
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:25,559
She wants him
all to herself.

909
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:27,599
She's not interested
in Phillip.

910
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,079
Nobody's interested in Phillip.
I am.

911
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,360
Mount up, Larita.

912
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,000
If you don't mind,
Mrs. Whittaker,

913
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,760
I think I might give
the fox a head start.

914
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:40,159
Lari, get on the pony,
please.

915
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:42,119
It's just as I thought.

916
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,440
Mrs. Whittaker, I said I'd ride,
and I'm always good for my word.

917
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,159

A victory lap,

There's something wild about

Uncle George?

946
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,559
Oh, thank God,
a friendly voice.

947
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,559
Yes, and she's
a complete nightmare.

948
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:38,280
Really?

949
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,559
How salacious.

950
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,960
Come in.

951
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,000
Mother?

952
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:52,440
I'd like to apologize
for today's schmozzle.

953
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,800
That really won't
be necessary.

954
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,679
In her defense, Larita made no secret
of her disapproval of blood sports.

955
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,360
She did ride as promised.

956
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,960
Well, we should credit her with her
imaginative way of keeping her word.

957
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:07,760
You must be
very proud of her.

958
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,320
Mother, I think...

959
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,000
I think maybe Larita
and I ought to go.

960
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,880
Oh.

961
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:18,639
Yes, I see.

962
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,159
Very well. Feel free to drop
in whenever it takes your fancy.

963
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:25,719
Off you go. Enjoy.
Don't be like that.

964
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,800
I'm sorry, dear, wasn't
Mummy being kind enough?

965
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,400
Here, take these. They might
get you as far as Constantinople,

966
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,199
and this, to Casablanca.

967
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,440
Mother, stop it!

968
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:36,440
No. You stop it!

969
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,199
Stop being so naive.

970
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,159
The money's gone, John.

971
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,880
Nothing left.

972
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,519
The only thing standing between
this family and bankruptcy

973
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:56,679
are those surveyors
in the back field.

974
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:04,239
Lord Hurst is offering to buy 400
acres to keep the bailiffs away.

975
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:08,079
It's your legacy,
John Whittaker,

976
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:10,559
and I'm selling it.

977
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:17,440
I had no idea.
No.

978
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,360
No, you don't.

979
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:26,360
You were supposed
to take over the estate.

980
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,960
You're supposed to take
your responsibilities,

981
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:31,800
but you were unexpectedly
flagged down.

982
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:36,719
I've been struggling for years
with a man who doesn't care,

983
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,079
waiting for you
to step up to the mark.

984
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,440
No. You just go.

985
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:48,280
Go to Algiers with
your racing car driver.

986
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,559
I'm too tired
to care anymore.

987
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,719
Well, it's not exactly surprising,
John. Look at the grounds.

988
01:00:57,039 --> 01:00:59,000
Your mother is being
very practical.

989
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,920
In what sense?

990
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:05,159
Well, you're not coming back.
Your father moved out decades ago.

991
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:08,719
Phillip's not going to marry Hilda.
Nobody's going to marry Marion.

992
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,159
Subdividing the land and selling to a
trusted neighbor is an elegant solution.

993
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:15,159
Somewhat harsh.

994
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:19,360
I've had my fair share
of selling off my past,

995
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,280
and it is an auction of innocence
that's neither fun nor pretty,

996
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,320
but it is realistic, something
your mother excels in.

997
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,519
But it's my responsibility.

998
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,239
Gracious, how can I
have been so blind?

999
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:16,840
Winter hydrangeas!
How do you do it?

1000
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,679
It's a controlled mixture of
passion, persistence and horse manure.

1001
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,559
I was hoping to catch a
glimpse of the new bride.

1002
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,199
Ah. John's wife has
very fickle allergies.

1003
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,719
Allergies to what?
Flowers, Emma.

1004
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,559
Flowers. Can you believe it?

1005
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,000
That is a strange choice of
bedfellow for this neck of the woods.

1006
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,760
We'll just have to make do
with John and Sarah.

1007
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
It will be like
old times.

Sarah, I've often meant
to ask you something,

1012
01:02:58,679 --> 01:02:59,679
but I hadn't the courage.

1013
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,199
Well, don't then.

1014
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:04,199
Did you think I behaved
like a cad,

1015
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,400
marrying Larita like that,
without telling you?

1016
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,239
No, of course not.

1017
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:11,960
You took the opportunity and married
for love, and I respect you for it.

1018
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,360
If we'd have married, it would have
been for friendship and convenience.

1019
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,800
Would it?
Yes.

1020
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,199
We knew one another
far too well.

1021
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:22,440
I want my marriage to be

1022
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:26,679
thrilling, romantic,
with passionate love letters.

1023
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,119
I could have written you
love letters.

1024
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:29,719
Well,
you didn't, did you?

1025
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:32,159
I did love you
all the same.

1026
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:35,719
John, stop it.

1027
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:47,360
He's very different from
the man I met in France.

1028
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,760
The boy.
The same, sweet boy.

1029
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:59,480
Is it true what she says?

1030
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,559
Are you really
selling off the land?

1031
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:06,239
To be perfectly honest,
I haven't the faintest idea.

1032
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:12,280
But it's your home.
It's your community.

1033
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,559
Doesn't that matter?

1034
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:16,719
No.

1035
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:21,079
You're a dark horse.

1036
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,119
Have you noticed how few men of
my age there are in this village?

1037
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,800
Fourteen years ago, we all
took the King's shilling.

1038
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,800
We all signed up together.

1039
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,400
My brother,

1040
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,440
friends,

1041
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,320
staff,

1042
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:45,960
all hunkered down in the
front row of the Great War.

1043
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:50,880
I thought they kept majors
safely behind desks.

1044
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,199
Promotion for surviving.

1045
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:58,480
As captain, it was my job to
get them all out of the trenches.

1046
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,800
Within the first four minutes
of our first charge,

1047
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:07,760
20, 000 men died.

1048
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,559
In Thorverton,
down the road here,

1049
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:19,199
they were stationed
in Morocco.

1050
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:22,559
Their captain brought them
all home.

1051
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:30,960
I didn't bring
a single man back.

1052
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,480
This whole village died.

1053
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,679
I think there's a glimmer
of life in you yet.

1054
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,119
Well, if there is, it has no time for
pet cemeteries and Japanese lanterns.

1055
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:46,239
Why did you come back?

1056
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,360
I had no choice.

1057
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:06,239
<i>She came for you.</i>

1058
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,000
Why the lie?

1059
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,000
She thought "wandering
home" sounded better.

1060
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:19,199
And, to be perfectly frank,
I no longer cared.

1061
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,960
I hate new games.

1062
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:29,119
There are too many balls.
I can't sink anything.

1063
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:31,840
Sink some gin,
Sausage Fingers.

1064
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:33,239
I never, ever win.

1065
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,400
Oh! Well done!

1066
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,199
Stop sucking it.
Come and help.

1067
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,320
Come on, Pops.

1068
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,480
All right, missy, hold your horses.

1069
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,239
All right.
Clear the decks, puppies.

1070
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,880
May I?

1071
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:02,199
I was hoping
to have a word.

1072
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,280
We're accentuating the positive today. I
really don't have a mind for anything else.

1073
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,440
Of course. Of course.

1074
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,440
I know you're under
considerable stress.

1075
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:16,800
Regarding what?

1076
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,960
Lord Hurst's kind offer
to buy into your property.

1077
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,880
The realtor I'm dealing with in
London also specializes in subdivision.

1078
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:30,880
Perhaps he could help
negotiate a premium price.

1079
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,320
Thank you, but really, this
is of no concern of yours.

1080
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,159
Of course
it is a concern.

1081
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,239
I am a member of this family
now, and I'd like to help.

1082
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,400
And this is your
interpretation of help, is it?

1083
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:45,480
Carving up our heritage and selling
it off to the highest bidder?

1084
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,480
Well, coming from a country no older
than the chair you are sitting in,

1085
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,559
it seems a very
practical solution.

1086
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,559
Just forget the seven
generations of people

1087
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:57,159
who have devoted their entire
lives to farming this land.

1088
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,639
Get someone else to do it,
with a machine, no less.

1089
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,480
Who do you think you are?

1090
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:09,039
Swinging your wherewithal
like a cat on heat.

1091
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,159
Now, if you really want to
be of assistance, Larita,

1092
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:16,680
I think you know
what's required.

1093
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,840
Right.

1094
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,800
I think it's time an expert
showed you how this game is played.

1095
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,199
Watch it.

1096
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,760
Bravo!
Bravo!

1097
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,680
What a sportswoman, I must
say. Can you imagine? Fantastic.

1098
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:37,880
Lari,
you're confusing me.

1099
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,520
I'm feeling
trapped, John.

1100
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,119
I don't understand.

1101
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:44,399
It's this house! It has an
air of doom hanging over it,

1102
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,039
and I can barely stand
the weight much longer.

1103
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,680
The answer is to
go abroad again.

1104
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,520
Not yet.

1105
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,960
This is my life for now,
you know that.

1106
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:02,960
And what part
do I play in it?

1107
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:04,399
Do you have to be so loud?

1108
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,319
Of course I do.
I'm American.

1109
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:17,600
What is the use of bickering like
this? It doesn't lead anywhere.

1110
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,399
You never know. It might
lead to a natural end.

1111
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:23,760
Do you want it to?

1112
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,079
Do you?

1113
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,119
No!

1114
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,159
I just want some
peace and quiet.

1115
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:36,079
You're far too young
to make a remark like that.

1116
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,239
I can't help my age...

1117
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,159
Grandma.

1118
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,520
Look, I'm sorry that I
leave you alone so much.

1119
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,119
Honestly, I'm sorry.

1120
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,760
Good. Then let's do
something about it.

1121
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,399
Why are we driving so fast?

1122
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:06,159
The thrill of escape.

1123
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,079
You're looking very game
today, fairest game in the land.

1124
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:17,680
A penny for your thoughts?

1125
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,039
It's more than pennies,
I'm afraid, Pinkie.

1126
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,159
I don't think I can afford
the party this year.

1127
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:24,720
But the Japanese lanterns!

1128
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,880
No, canceled.

1129
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,800
Had to choose, Japanese
lanterns or the maid.

1130
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,560
No, you're not getting out
of it that easily, my dear.

1131
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,359
My offer of cellar
and staff still stands.

1132
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,720
It wouldn't be Christmas
without your knees-up.

1133
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,880
This is the first piece of
clarity I've had since arriving.

1134
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,039
Why can't we live in
moments like these forever?

1135
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,840
Why?

1136
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:06,159
Because you've stopped
loving me, my darling.

1137
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,800
How can you say that?

1138
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:11,840
Oh, I just open my mouth
and the words come out.

1139
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:15,359
Then let's make
a fresh start.

1140
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,520
There are so many things
I need to tell you about me.

1141
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:35,560
Hard things.

1142
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,119
I don't care.

1143
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:38,600
I do.

1144
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:44,039
It doesn't matter.
I trust you absolutely.

1145
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:49,479
<i>♪ I see you again</i>

1146
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,880
<i>♪ Whenever spring
breaks through again</i>

1147
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:55,399
Come on.

1148
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:00,640
<i>♪ Time may lie heavy between</i>

1149
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:07,239
<i>♪ But what has been
is past forgetting</i>

1150
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,119
Stop.

1151
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:20,239
<i>♪ Throughout my life
will come to me</i>

1152
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:23,600
<i>♪ Though the world
may go awry ♪</i>

1153
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:28,520
Shot!

1154
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,600
John!

1155
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,960
Top hole!

1156
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:44,079
Oh!

1157
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:46,479
I can't decide
which is worse,

1158
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,880
the idea that you had to sneak
outside to get some privacy

1159
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,920
or that you were
caught by Veronica.

1160
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:52,640
Who's Veronica?

1161
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:55,680
I am. It's my name.

1162
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,439
I fail to see
the humor in it, Jim.

1163
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,039
No, darling, you know,
you're quite right.

1164
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:04,000
I can certainly see
the serious implications.

1165
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:05,800
It's really not
a laughing matter.

1166
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,199
It's only
a laughing matter.

1167
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:12,119
Indecent exposure is
illegal, even in America.

1168
01:13:12,359 --> 01:13:13,560
No... Yeah.

1169
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,680
You're right. And we're very,
very sorry. Aren't we, Lari?

1170
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,479
Well, no. I'm not.

1171
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,159
This is my husband.

1172
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:21,439
And this is my home!

1173
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,880
Well, maybe it's time for the
young ones to fly the nest.

1174
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,239
Certainly not.

1175
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,880
They will stay put
and brazen this out.

1176
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,079
And you can get that ghastly
painting out of my house.

1177
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:34,079
We do not need any more
reminders of your easy virtue.

1178
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,880
No!

1179
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:43,800
Help me, Jack.
Right.

1180
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:46,079
Excited, Furber?
Overwhelmed, sir.

1181
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,119
Jolly good!
Miss Hilda.

1182
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:51,840
Uncle George.
How explosive!

1183
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,560
Furber, I recognize
that as asparagus.

1184
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,079
Correct, madam.

1185
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,680
Ha!

1186
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,119
I pity poor Panda.
Oh, what is it now?

1187
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:01,199
Read.

1188
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,479
<i>The Detroit News.</i>

1189
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,520
Uncle George is
a super sleuth!

1190
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,800
Collecting old newspapers is the
last refuge of a truly boring man.

1191
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,039
Boring? Far from it. It was a scandal!

1192
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:16,159
Wasn't it, Mrs. Morley?

1193
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:20,640
Mrs. Tom Morley
of Detroit, Michigan.

1194
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,359
Don't be grotesque, Hilda.

1195
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I suppose I'd better finish my
meal before it wilts entirely.

1196
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:28,319
Any dressing?

1197
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,119
Oh, I am genuinely shocked.

1198
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:31,920
No, thanks, I always
end up wearing it.

1199
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,319
We've been hoodwinked!

1200
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:35,159
Mmm. Especially that
runny vinaigrette.

1201
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:36,359
Fire and brimstone!

1202
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:37,840
Mayonnaise has more ballast.

1203
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,960
Will you stop this insulting
behavior immediately?

1204
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,000
Hmm.

1205
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,960
I always hated that
photo of myself.

1206
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:52,000
Of everything
I've ever expected,

1207
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,079
nothing could have
prepared me for this.

1208
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:55,404
Prepared you for what?

1209
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:57,840
She was charged with
murder. I was acquitted.

1210
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,359
And that's consolation?

1211
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:00,720
I told you my husband died.

1212
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,840
Yes, but you didn't tell us how,
did you? Does John know about this?

1213
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:06,640
Oh, I see.

1214
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,720
It's no concern of ours.

1215
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,239
Father! Really!

1216
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,239
Yes, and after Hilda went through
all that trouble digging it up.

1217
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:15,880
In fact, I'm going outside for a
cigarette. Would you care to join me?

1218
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,520
Thank you, Jim,
don't mind if I do.

1219
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,279
No concern?

1220
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,359
The pack's closing.

1221
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:33,600
This woman has taken
advantage of our son.

1222
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,359
He'd never have married her
if he'd known the truth.

1223
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:36,479
You know that,
do you?

1224
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,479
I suppose you would have
preferred we had an affair?

1225
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,039
Well, I think it would
have been more appropriate!

1226
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:41,119
Mother!

1227
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:43,760
Unfortunately,
I agree with you!

1228
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,960
Oh, it's easy
to talk like this now.

1229
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:48,119
It isn't easy.
It's heartbreaking.

1230
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:50,159
I love John,
but it's not blind love.

1231
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:54,479
Marion, does that sound
indicate contempt or asthma?

1232
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,880
You can't palm us off
like that, Mrs. Morley.

1233
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,000
This
is your doing, child.

1234
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,279
You're a bigger fool
than you look.

1235
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,239
Larita is your type,
isn't she, Father?

1236
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:03,039
That is the nicest thing
any of you have ever said.

1237
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:04,239
God forgive you.

1238
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:06,479
Hello,
are we having a picnic?

1239
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:09,439
John,

1240
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:14,119
I think your wife better unveil
this one herself. Don't you, Larita?

1241
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,000
Before we met,

1242
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:23,439
I was involved in a court case
over the death of my husband.

1243
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,479
It was seedy and stressful,

1244
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,920
but since I was
found innocent,

1245
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,319
I didn't think it necessary
to burden you with the details.

1246
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,800
Innocent?

1247
01:16:35,079 --> 01:16:37,880
She was responsible
for a man killing himself!

1248
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,800
The verdict was suicide, but
that's not where it started.

1249
01:16:42,039 --> 01:16:43,960
I thought it was cancer.

1250
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:45,439
It was.

1251
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,039
But he was so
desperately sick.

1252
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,600
If you would have known him, you would
have understood how forgivable it was.

1253
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,119
It's not as if
she poisoned him herself.

1254
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,359
Well, that's what everyone thinks.

1255
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:56,760
She's a black widow. I pity you, Marion.

1256
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,199
Really?
Well, I won't let you!

1257
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:00,279
Right, that's it!

1258
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:02,279
You have a dance to organize,
I suggest you all get to it.

1259
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:04,279
Now, go on! Now!

1260
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,319
Hilda! Come on, inside!

1261
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:15,479
John.

1262
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:44,000
Are you crying because
you're angry or ashamed?

1263
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:47,920
Neither.

1264
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,199
Coming here has been the most
demoralizing experience of my life.

1265
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,399
Why didn't you tell me?

1266
01:18:03,319 --> 01:18:05,359
I wanted to, everything
just happened so fast.

1267
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:06,960
That's not good enough.

1268
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,880
I tried to,
several times,

1269
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,600
but you trusted me
"absolutely. "

1270
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,520
And you saw the field day those
fatuous hypocrites made of it.

1271
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,720
Larita, please remember
they're my family.

1272
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,279
I shouldn't think of them
at all if they weren't.

1273
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,760
Still,

1274
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:33,239
you should have told me.

1275
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,640
You should have
loved me more.

1276
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,960
I couldn't love you
any more.

1277
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:43,439
You should have
loved me better.

1278
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,760
I don't understand you,
Larita.

1279
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:52,920
I don't understand you
at all.

1280
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,199
Are you all left feet?

1281
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,800
Dancing with you is like
trying to move a piano.

1282
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:22,920
Ow!

1283
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,079
I wonder what the
American will be wearing?

1284
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,439
Or who she'll be poisoning.

1285
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:34,279
Do you like long
moonlit walks?

1286
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,039
Only when taken by
people who annoy me.

1287
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:41,600
You've got me all to yourself, Phillip.
Larita's upstairs with a headache.

1288
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,840
And which little fool,
pray tell, gave her that?

1289
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:04,520
Do you think you ought to go
and see if Larita is coping?

1290
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,359
I already have. She's fine.

1291
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:08,520
It's been a very trying day
for her, John.

1292
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:11,319
Go and escort
your wife down.

1293
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:12,680
No, I wouldn't worry.

1294
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,640
You know my wife, she'll make
an entrance when she's ready.

1295
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,239
Come in.

1296
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:28,279
Quickly,
you'll blow my cover.

1297
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:38,760
Why are you sitting
in the dark?

1298
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,000
Watching.

1299
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:46,920
People are so universally
similar when their guard is down.

1300
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:56,199
It seems they are universally similar
when their guard is up, as well.

1301
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:01,600
May I?

1302
01:21:04,119 --> 01:21:06,279
Thank you for being
gallant today.

1303
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:08,680
You are damn cool
in a crisis.

1304
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,319
The judge at my trial
said something similar.

1305
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:16,520
Why did you do it?

1306
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,279
Why did you marry John?

1307
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,279
My first husband was older,
and his end was messy.

1308
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:31,359
Long afterwards this

1309
01:21:33,319 --> 01:21:36,680
boy, this pure boy

1310
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,319
arrived fresh
and unblemished.

1311
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:46,159
I married him because any
other relationship seemed

1312
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:49,720
cheap and squalid.

1313
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,079
My first marriage cost me my youth,
and here I am stealing someone else's.

1314
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,119
What will you do?

1315
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:04,000
The best I can.

1316
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:12,960
Davis, thank you.

1317
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,960
And thank you, Pinkie.

1318
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:16,760
No, not at all, my dear.

1319
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:18,760
Just look at this turnout.

1320
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:23,840
Hmm. They've only come for a repeat
performance of the Cincinnati succubus.

1321
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,439
May I have
the pleasure?

1322
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:02,239
Look.

1323
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:23,239
Tango, please.
Certainly.

1324
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:25,640
Tango.
Tango.

1325
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,079
Dance with me, John.

1326
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,279
Lari, don't.

1327
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:42,439
Please, dance with me.

1328
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,319
That was very gallant.

1329
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:19,960
You've got to
stop them, Mother.

1330
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:21,279
No, I don't.

1331
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:03,840
Marvelous.
Marvelous.

1332
01:26:05,399 --> 01:26:10,880
Straight from the bordellos of Buenos
Aires to the Hippodrome of London, maestro.

1333
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:12,359
Take it away.

1334
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,720
Jim, this is the end.

1335
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:29,920
Congratulations,madam.

1336
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:31,680
Have you been drinking,
Furber?

1337
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,640
Yes, madam. Prodigiously.

1338
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,319
You are full of surprises.

1339
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:38,079
Yes, madam.
I was even arrested once.

1340
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,039
What for?

1341
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:41,359
Bigamy.

1342
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:51,960
Ah, there you are, Pinkie. I've found you.

1343
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,760
Larita,
where are you going?

1344
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:08,039
Away, Sarah,
for John's sake.

1345
01:27:08,119 --> 01:27:09,439
Far, far away.

1346
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:13,159
Is there anything
I can do?

1347
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:14,760
You can look after him.

1348
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,800
Women like me are tiresome
in love. We expect too much.

1349
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,840
Marry John.

1350
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,239
It's the way things always should have
been. I'm just so sorry I got in the way.

1351
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,479
You love him that much?

1352
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,680
Go. I'll cover for you.

1353
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,239
Sweet Sarah.

1354
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:43,640
I'm so glad you've
recovered from your headache.

1355
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:47,560
Please don't build any convenient
social lies on my behalf.

1356
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,760
Oh, I say,
Mother is only...

1357
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,920
Fighting to keep
the charade alive?

1358
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:55,319
You've shown tremendous fortitude
holding this family together, Veronica,

1359
01:27:55,399 --> 01:27:56,920
and I can respect that.

1360
01:27:57,399 --> 01:28:02,119
But what I can't respect is the manipulative
road you've chosen to maintain control.

1361
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,800
This war is over.
Move on.

1362
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,239
Move on.
Oh, how convenient.

1363
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:12,399
Oh, wake up, Marion.
Edgar's not coming back.

1364
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,079
And that ring isn't stuck, you are.

1365
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:18,880
And, Hilda, you've got such promise,
yet you're squandering it on malice.

1366
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:23,600
My advice to both
you girls? Run.

1367
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,880
Go see the world
through your own eyes.

1368
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:31,960
So speaks the siren, leading
the sailors to their death.

1369
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:34,239
Well, at least I'm not Medusa,
turning them to stone.

1370
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:36,520
Get out!

1371
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,720
Larita?
Fine.

1372
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,560
Lari? Lari, don't go.

1373
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:45,039
John, I have to.
I can't live here.

1374
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,600
Nothing can.

1375
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,720
But you're my wife,
and I love you.

1376
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:53,840
Oh, John, my darling.

1377
01:28:56,319 --> 01:28:58,399
You don't know
what love is.

1378
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:03,279
You have no idea what it
means to love someone so much

1379
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:05,760
that you will do
anything for them.

1380
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,840
Even inject
them with poison

1381
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,359
when they're too feeble
to do it for themselves.

1382
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:25,560
I don't believe that you could
have ever loved me like that.

1383
01:29:34,359 --> 01:29:36,119
Oh, John, let her go.

1384
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,039
Let her go.

1385
01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:44,199
Off into the sunset to inject
another family with her poison.

1386
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:46,239
Mother.
Go on, off you go.

1387
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:49,359
Before your past
catches up with you, again!

1388
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:50,600
Mother!

1389
01:29:54,279 --> 01:29:55,600
You evil...

1390
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,239
Mother! Shut up!

1391
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:03,399
They are predicting
warmer weather, madam.

1392
01:30:03,479 --> 01:30:06,479
Yes, Furber, I believe
they are. Thank you.

1393
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:13,479
Very generous.

1394
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:17,079
There's something special
in there for Jackson.

1395
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:19,079
Please make sure he gets it. Of course.

1396
01:30:19,159 --> 01:30:20,720
Where will Madam
be staying?

1397
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:23,399
Who knows?

1398
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:25,720
Good luck.

1399
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:28,960
And you, Furber.

1400
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,319
Would you forward the
painting please, Furber?

1401
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,600
To where, sir?

1402
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:44,319
I shall enjoy passing
on the good news, sir.
