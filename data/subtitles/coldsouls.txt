{} RUSSIAN 01 START



After the soul is extracted
in New York.



You'll travel with Nina



and one other mule.



Yes... Dimitri.



I don't get it...



You didn't make the quota



again this month.



Yes.



And the military?



They passed on it.



We have to identify new outlets



and it takes time... Dimitri...



I'm not arguing...



If the US government steps in



we're out of business.



I want my soul back.



I'm sorry, that's impossible.



You signed the NCNR clause here.



It's non-cancelable, non-returnable.



No.



What if everyone was doing that?



We wouldn't be in business,
would we?



{} RUSSIAN 02 START



Nina, what did you write here?



That's the scientist.



He didn't believe he had a soul.



Next!



Sasha, how many poets' souls do we have?



Fourteen.



No... Not enough.



All right.
So the scientist is a poet and...



...this one also...



"Jellybean".



Boss?



20,000?



Have you seen it?



Seen what?



For crying out loud!
It looks like a prune!



Get out!



Next!



Listen up.



We're selling Russian souls to Americans.



What about selling...



American souls to Russians?



Who wants to buy an American soul?



Well, Oleg...



Sveta, to begin with.



Don't you, honey?



She says to have an American soul



will help her acting.



She made a list.



Kevin Spacey, George Clooney,



Robert Redford, Al Pacino...



Baby...



No actresses?



Why don't you pick some actresses too?



You guys add some females in there.



How do you expect us to do that?



You'll find a way, Oleg.



{} RUSSIAN 03 START



Have you seen this?



It's a chickpea. (This line was NOT in Russian)



It's a pea...



For God's sake.



A chickpea.



The shape doesn't mean anything.



It's a beautiful soul.



Does Dimitri know about this?



Get him!



Get him now!



I want him to see what he does to me!



Fellas. I've got a little problem...



{} RUSSIAN 04 START



You shouldn't judge by appearances.



Al Pacino won three Oscars.



But it's a chickpea!



A chickpea!



It'll work fine.



{} RUSSIAN 05 START



Do you have any American films with Paul Giamatti?

Paul Giamatti. Paul Giamatti.



{} RUSSIAN 06 START



Do you know when she plans to return the soul?



I'm not paying you to ask questions.



{} RUSSIAN 07 SECTION



You said everything was fine!



Yes...



then they found out.



So what?



It's not my problem.



He's here now.



So yes, it's your problem.



How much is he paying you?



I'm doing you a favor.



So you don't lose Flintstein.



You really think I'm an idiot?



You can't trust anyone, can you?



{} RUSSIAN 08 SECTION START



Nina...



tell him.



You tell him.



{}  RUSSIAN 09 SECTION START



Get him out of my sight...

{} RUSSIAN 10 SECTION START



Sir, we're busy here...
you'll have to leave.



I'm sorry.



What are you doing here?



Who is this guy?



He's a famous actor in America.



He came all the way from New York...



Dimitri knows about this?



Please! You're disturbing everyone!



What is she... What are you...
What is she doing?



No need to call him. He knows.



He lied, right?



Not at all. It's not what you think.



{} RUSSIAN 11 START



Is he a relative?



No, just a friend from America.



I didn't know
she had friends in America.



Olga...



two weeks ago...



committed suicide.



She had no family.



Do you want her address?



{}  RUSSIAN 12 SECTION



I didn't know she had friends
in America.



She never paid on time.



Except before the tragedy...



She paid off all her debts at once.



All this is going into the garbage.
