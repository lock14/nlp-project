Good morning, America.



It's now 1 2 noon
in Salamanca, Spain.



In a short time, world leaders
from over 1 50 countries...



...meet here in Plaza Mayor...



...to sign up to President Ashton's
bold new counterterrorist strategy.



Since 9/ 1 1, more than 4500 people
have been killed...



...in the rising tide of global terror.



Those lives will not
soon be forgotten...



...as today, the world comes together
to take a stand against this violence.



We may be on the brink
of a historic agreement...



...between Western
and Arab leaders.



Security services are on high alert
in Salamanca...



...where we go live to our news team
and our reporter Angie Jones.



Five, four, three, two....



I am standing inside PIaza Mayor
in SaIamanca, Spain...



...where crowds have Iined up
for the kickoff of...



...what is without question
a landmark summit.



For months,
President Ashton's been working...



...with leaders
from five continents...



...to forge a new groundbreaking
alliance in the ongoing war on terror.



And now here, today...



... Western and Arab leaders
will meet for the first time...



...to formalize this new coalition...



...designed to once and for aII...



...put a strangIehoId
on internationaI terrorism.



-Bring him up.
-Cue Mark.



-Tell us, Angie, what's the mood like?
-For the most part, hopeful.



Everyone here is very
sympathetic to those...



...who lost loved ones
in the recent bombing.



I did, however, speak to delegates...



What's she doing?



...both of whom took a hard line,
suggesting that U.S. foreign policy...



Kevin, shut her down.



...has to bear some responsibility
for the recent events.



Thanks, Angie.
You'll have to keep us informed.



- What the heII was that?
- Not everyone loves us, Rex.



Why don't you Ieave the punditry
to someone paid to have an opinion?



I'm cool with censorship.
I know the American people love that.



-Come on, Angie. Lighten up.
-Got it.



-GaIIery.
-Pass me over.



-Bruce.
-Yes.



-What was that? Stick to the script.
-I toId her. Wanna teII her?



-Fine.
-That's fine.



-Who is the cIown on two?
-Two is Luis.



Camera two, are you gonna move?



We're here for the summit,
not the sideshow.



Man, it's Iike training
a freaking dog.



Okay, everybody,
the president is about to arrive.



When he does, we're on him.
Let's get our ducks in a row.



Three, wider.
Four, stay where you are.



Kevin, keep it moving.
I'm dying here.



Camera five,
give me the motorcade.



Number seven, concentrate.
I wanna go cIose on the president.



AII right, sir.



That's good.



Tighten up, five. Good.



-Isn't that...?
-It's Thomas Barnes.



Why didn't we know he was here?
Shit, Grace. We shouId've had this.



Yeah, I don't....



-Kevin, puII the archives.
-PuII the archives, pIease.



The president's approaching
the pIaza. AII cameras ready.



Angie, we're back in 20.



And remember, we're here
for the summit, not the sideshow.



-There are other stories.
-I don't give a shit.



UnIess the protesters set themseIves
on fire, they're not our story.



-Kevin, you got it?
-Yeah.



Check this out.



This was onIy Iast year.
I can't beIieve he's back aIready.



If we're the onIy ones
who have this....



He won't taIk. A year ago we had HiII,
we had that guy who saved Reagan.



-McCarthy.
-AII of them.



A hero piece.
Barnes wanted nothing to do with it.



That was then.



It's a shame. It wouId've made a great
side story. We've no time to work it in.



That was then, this is now,
okay, guys? We've got our story.



Okay, cue graphics.



Camera five, give me a singIe.



-Here comes the mayor.
-Three, four, ready at the podium.



Three, wide. Four, in cIose. Start with
the Ieaders and end with the mayor.



-Thank you so much for being here.
-Three, puII back.



Yes. Camera six, get ready.
We're coming to you.



Good. That's good.



-Two, give me crowds.
-De Soto speech ending in one minute.



Camera five, give me something eIse
to work with. That's good.



Angie, when this is over,
I want a 1 5-second fiII to wrap it up.



-Keep it simpIe.
-You mean dumb it down?



Get off it, Angie. Come on.



She's unbeIievabIe.



I offer you my city....



The mayor's done in five.
Ready with the graphics.



This summit could be the
defining moment of his presidency.



PuII out, four, three--



Oh, my God.



The president appears
to have been shot.



-Shit.
-I heard two shots...



-...and the president fell.
-Who's that guy?



What's he doing?



Okay, five, stay with that guy.
Everyone eIse, give me Ashton.



Three, stick with the president.
Just stay with him.



That's good. Just stay with him.
Stay with him. HoId it there.



This is insane.



Yeah, yeah. I'm coming back.



-Camera three, do better.
-They're not letting me through.



Don't give me this buIIshit.
Figure it out.



Okay, you got him?



-What was that?
-There appears to be an explosion....



Camera four, turn around.
Find out what that was.



Kevin, get pIayback going. We have
to upIink everything we've got.



-Bruce.
-UpIink VTs 1 through 7 on my monitor.



Okay, Angie, you're on. Let's go.



We're Iive, Angie. This is it. Go.



I need a minute, Rex. All right?



Shit. Get Mark to stretch.



I know this is tough, okay?
I know that.



We need you to teII us
what's going on.



-Okay.
-Focus, okay?



Angie? Please, tell us
what you're seeing.



-Deep breath. Go.
-The president of the United States...



...has been shot.
There have been several gunshots.



It appears there was also a bomb
that went off outside the plaza.



There are people running scared--



Oh, shit!



Mark?



Mark, you gotta fiII.



It seems that a huge bomb....



Oh, my God. Angie! Angie!



At the moment,
smoke from the explosion...



...mercifully covers the extent
of the human carnage.



There must be many people dead
and injured.



-Angie.
-This truly is terrible.



Come on, kiddo, get up.



Get up.



Kevin, puII the feed.



Turn it off!



Good morning, America.



It's now 1 2 noon
in Salamanca, Spain.



In a short time, world leaders
from over 1 50 countries--



It's time.



--Plaza Mayor to sign up
to President Ashton's...



...bold new
counterterrorist strategy.



Since 9/ 1 1,
more than 4500 people...



...have been killed
in the rising tide of global terror.



Those lives will not

All teams, this is Control.



-Motorcade one minute to landing.
-Copy.



-Level 4B, clear.
-Roger, Control.



-It was before he Iost it.
-Come on.



-Guy had a nervous breakdown.
-Six months ago.



He's not that guy anymore.
Give him a break.



What are the chances he freaks out
the minute we waIk?



I'd put it at fifty-fifty.



We doing this?



Mr. President.



All teams, this is Control.
Eagle is on the move.



Tell us, Angie,
what's the mood there?



For the most part, hopeful.



Everyone here
is very sympathetic to those...



...who lost loved ones
in the recent bombing.



Thanks.



For what?



For getting me back out here.



Don't thank me yet.



Mr. President?



Here we go.



AII right, sir.



What a beautifuI baby.



Thank you.



Thank you so much.



It's a wonderfuI day.



Hey! Drop it.

...it is with great pIeasure
that I invite you aII to our humbIe city.



And it is with a sad heart...



...that we must meet in mourning...



...for those who Iost Ioved ones

Back annex, the buiIding
shouId have been cIeared.



Copy. It's clear.



I've got a fIutter on the second fIoor.



Seventh window from the Ieft.



-Copy. We'll check again.
-The hopes of the worId...



...are with us.



Let us not disappoint them.



For we cannot today...



...or ever, Iet the specter of eviI...



...overcome the hope
of a better tomorrow.



It's just a fan that's been Ieft on.
We got it.



Therefore, I offer you my city,
my heart and my hope.



Barnes!



Barnes!



-Barnes!
-EagIe's down!



Repeat, EagIe's down!



Got a GSW. Repeat, GSW.



-Get him out of here!
-Move! Move!



Move him! Go! Go, go, go!



Pick him up! One, two, three.



You got him?



Find that shooter.



ControI, I want a perimeter
set a haIf bIock out.



Sweep the buiIdings
aIong the back annex.



No one goes in or out
without our go.



-Okay, you got him?
-Veronica!



-ControI.
-Do something!



Come in, ControI!
I need a 20 on POTUS.



ControI. Come in, ControI. Damn it!



-Listen to me!
-I said back up! Hey, shut up!



Listen! We are in danger.
We gotta get out of here!



Now, get up! I said get up!



-Let me have him.
-Let me go.



Barnes.



Why'd you run for the president?
Why did you run for the president?



-Barnes, we're handIing this.
-I hear bang.



-I protect the mayor. It's my job!
-You got there pretty fast.



-Barnes, he's a cop.
-I don't care, he knows something!



Get him out of here! Get him out.



Don't reIease him!



I've been set up!
You got the wrong person!



ControI. ControI, come in.



There's no response from ControI.



I just spoke with them.
POTUS is secure.



TiII we find that shooter,
we're shutting the city down.



This never shouId've happened.



Except that it did.
And it happened on our watch.



I can't Iive with that.



We gotta find him.



-Sir, we need your camera.
-Sure.



-Where's the zoom?
-It's that right here.



Right there.
That's where the fIutter was.



But the shot was up and to the Ieft.



Wait, you saw the shooter?



No. But I saw something.
Like a fIash of Iight.



-I saw a man in that room, sir.
-I'II check it out.



-I'm coming with you.
-No! No.



If you're wrong, Iet me take the heat.



Sir, did you fiIm this entire thing?



-Yes.
-Show me.



I think I got the shooter on tape.



Wait, go forward.



Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
There's a bomb at the podium!



There's a bomb at the podium!



Everybody get down!



This never should've happened.



Find that shooter.



Flash of light.



Find that shooter.



He just waIked. He just waIked.



Medic! We need a medic here!



Barnes.



We're gonna get you
some heIp, buddy.

Hey! Hey, stop him! Stop him!



Stop! Stop!



Hey, freeze!



Secret Service.
I need to see your tapes.



Yeah. Kevin.



I need to see any footage you have
of the back part of the pIaza.



-We need footage of the pIaza.
-How much do you need?



Just give me everything.



Can you hear me?
Camera three, can you hear me?



Just pIay it back from there.
Yeah.



-Barnes, you were right.
-About what?



About the shooter. I'm in pursuit,
leaving the back annex, heading west.



Repeat, heading west.

-No. No, I need you to.



-I got it. Go.

-Camera seven, can you hear me?
-ControI? Come in, ControI.



ControI, come in.



-I need you to teII us--
-Damn it.



Okay. We need you to teII us
where you are.



This is Agent Barnes. ControI is down.
My partner is in pursuit of a suspect.



We need immediate assistance
just outside the back annex.



Grace, they have a suspect.



Headed west on the surface streets.



-West.
-Do you copy?



Camera six, if you can hear me,
turn around and go west.



Camera six, if you can hear me,
turn around and go west.



Backup is on its--

Barnes, what is it?



Rewind that.



Six? Six, did you get aII that?



Stop.



Oh, my God.



What? What? What did he see?



Next.



PoIice, I work for the mayor.



Are you armed?



Are you armed?



Yes.



Okay, I'II turn it off. Go through.



I'II be at the underpass.



You have a gIow about you.



It's the heat.



The heat?



What have you been doing?



Nothing.



Taking in the crowd.



Some more than others?



I saw you just now.



-You saw nothing.
-It didn't Iook Iike nothing.



You don't have to worry about him,
I promise.



Enrique.



You're the one that I want,
there is no one eIse.



How many ways do I need to say it?



When you've finished here we'II go
away together, just you and me.



I Iove you.



Did you remember to bring my bag?



Thank you.



-I Iove you.
-I Iove you.



Ladies and gentIemen,

When do we think

It's not Iike I have to make
a speech now.



I couId just wing it. How much troubIe
couId I reaIIy get myseIf into?



Thanks. Nice to know
we both know my Iimitations.



-We're stopping?
-Yes, sir.



Rick, I'II caII you back.



The NSA's just confirmed the threat.



-Control, handoff complete.
-Roger, point man.



Where's PhiI?



The hoteI.
He's on with the Joint Chiefs.



He's sending the doubIe, isn't he?



Yeah.



We're moving POTUS to the hoteI.



ControI, we've N.D.'d the car.
POTUS is returning.



We issue a statement that we're
deferring to Prime Minister Gutierrez--



Deferring, that's great.



Control, E TA to castle
is two minutes.



Today of aII days.



Christ.



Sir, we've used doubIes
since Reagan.



That was for photo ops.
Not for anything this big.



Control, we have PO TUS
and we are moving to the castle.



Eagle has arrived at the plaza.



Control, we have PO TUS
and are entering the castle.



-Sir.
-TaIk to me, PhiI.



NSA caIIed it five minutes ago.
It's reaI.



And the summit? You're not
thinking of puIIing out entireIy?



Why wouId we?



Do we know who's behind this?



A IocaI group with a vague connection
to the Mujahedin Brigade.



-Why issue the threat now?
-U.S. SpeciaI Forces...



...uncovered a pIot to smuggIe
a bomb out of Morocco.



We took their bomb and their men,
and this may be their retaIiation.



You think trying to kiII me
is a retaIiation.



POTUS is moving.



Safe for Eagle to exit vehicle.



Copy that.



This is them?



That's Benwar Suarez. As near
as we can teII, he Ieads the group.



And what do we know about him?



He's from Morocco,
educated in Paris.



He went off the map for awhiIe,
but he surfaced in Beirut, Darfur.



CoupIe days ago we intercepted an
e-maiI between members of his group.



Embedded in it were Iinks to maps,
bIueprints of the area.



It was this morning
that we received the threat.



The Joint Chiefs,
what do they recommend?



That we go after their Ieadership.



Here in Spain?



Morocco.



We have a sateIIite Iock
on one of their camps there.



You want me to caII in a strike
on a friendIy Arab nation?



They're harboring terrorists.



-And this inteI, we're certain--?
-AbsoIuteIy.



ControI, we're cIear on seven.



Why not focus on the ones
who are here actuaIIy doing this?



This summit is too important.



But we're Iooking for five peopIe
out of 6 miIIion. We are trying.



Try harder.



Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States:



President Henry Ashton.



A wonderfuI day. Some words now.



WeIcome.



This is a wondrous day.



Today, we make history.



-He doesn't even Iook Iike me.
-Senor Presidente...



...fellow members
of the European Union...



...President Ashton...



...and citizens of the world...



...it is with great pleasure that
I invite you all to our humble city.



Is that Thomas?



Yes, sir.



I thought he was stiII inactive.



He was.



WeII, if he's back,
why isn't he with me?



We weren't sure if he was ready.



-You sent him out there.
-We need someone to seII the doubIe.



SeII? He took a buIIet for me, PhiI.



And Iook at him.



He hasn't stopped
punishing himseIf since.



I Iiked him every bit
as much as you did.



But we needed to know
we couId count on him again.



So you threw him out there
to see if he couId?



That's how we treat
our friends now?



Therefore...



...I offer you my city,
my heart and my hope.



This summit could very well be the
defining moment of his presidency.



Jesus!



The president appears
to have been shot.



I heard two shots,
and the president fell.



Get the Joint Chiefs on the Iine now.



AdmiraI Houston, it's McCuIIough.
Have you seen the situation?



The president is secure.



Get him out of here!



How Iong do we have to get
the birds in the air?



So you're ready to strike now?



Mr. President.



Sir.



Mr. President.



The Chiefs have a sateIIite Iock
on their viIIage. They're ready.



Sir?



Ted?



-There's an issue of when we can go.
-We go now.



You can't give the order.
You've been shot.



We go now, we risk teIIing the worId
that you weren't there.



We weren't there, Ted.



Get the vice president to do it.



No, we are not going near
the 25th Amendment.



TeII Rick to work up a story
I was shot, but I'm okay.



That's not gonna fIy.



If we have to go to some hospitaI
and put on a show, we do it.



-We have to taIk--
-I'm done taIking!



Christ!



Sir, we gotta go now.
We have to attack.



Sir?



Cavic, find out what's
going on down there.



Mr. President, pIease step away

-Cavic to ControI.
-Mr. President.



TeII them to stand down.



Sir, we have to respond!



Bombing a camp in Morocco wiII
bIow this summit out of the water.



That is what the peopIe
behind this want me to do.



Mr. President,
we have to act strong.



No, we have to be strong.



They sent us a warning
because they want us to react.



They know our pIaybook.



They're banking on us doing
what we aIways do. We wiII hit back.



We have the worId's sympathy
right now.



Let's honor that. Let's finish
what we came here to do.



Okay, copy that.



Everything is being prepared
to transport the president.



We need to get the president
to Air Force One now.



I'm done hiding.
This is the president, is my wife there?



-We have to be better than this.
-Sir.



-Yeah, get Air Force One ready....
-Kay, it's me.



No, we're fine here. We're safe.



Good morning, America. It's now

This was taken 1 5 minutes ago.



You wouId find that we are

What have you done to him?



He's stiII in one piece.



You shouId be happy about that.

We never see this side of the story.

I've got her Iecturing me now.



We're here for the conference
not the sideshow.



Is everything going to pIan?



To the Iast detaiI.



And the president?



Are you sure they sent a doubIe?



The beauty of American arrogance...



...is that they cannot imagine a worId
where they're not a step ahead.



Has the package arrived?



-As we speak.
-Perfect.



Javier will be by.



Understood.



Felipe.



You wiII make us very proud.



Control, we have PO TUS

Copy that.
Eagle has arrived at the plaza.



-Javier.
-Yeah.



Are you in position?



-I'm on my way.
-Good.



For the moment, the Americans think
they've dodged a buIIet. Do not be Iate.



-Don't worry about me.
-I won't.



Your brother spoke very highIy
of your SpeciaI Forces training.



Do not disappoint him.



You just make sure my brother

Come on, guys. Move, move, move!



What's the status on level seven?

We need footage
of the back of the pIaza.



Again.

-Go ahead.



ControI is down. My partner
is in pursuit of a suspect.



We need immediate assistance
outside the back annex.



-Give me a heading.
-They have a suspect.



Headed west on surface streets.
Do you copy?



West, copy that.



Camera six, if you can hear me,

Backup is on its--



What? Barnes, what is it?



Barnes.



Oh, my God.



-I'm coming with you.
-No.



If you're wrong, Iet me take the heat.



-Barnes, you were right.

About the shooter. I'm in pursuit,
Ieaving the back annex, heading west.



What?



Barnes, what is it?



Barnes.



Hey!



Secret Service, get out of the car.
Get-- Get out of the car.



-Washington.
-This is Barnes.



Look, I know how this is gonna sound,
but Agent TayIor has gone rogue.



CaII the other agents back.



I know I made the caII,
but there's something eIse going on.



-Barnes.
-ControI is compromised.



-All agents are heading west.
-Listen to me! Damn it!



Goddamn it!



Let him go.



What are you taIking about?



My brother. I've done my part.
Now you Iet him go.



Put the gun down.



Make the caII. Or I puII the trigger,
and your pIan's finished.



Again.



Again.



Go ahead.



Do it.



Do it and your brother is dead.



Can you Iive with that? Knowing that
your brother died because of you?



Javier, Iisten to me.



He's going to be deIivered

Don't mess it up now.



You'II get your brother back.



Nothing....



Nothing had better happen to him.



Nothing wiII.

Veronica.



I'm here.



We did it.



Not yet.



-Yeah.
-Barnes, PO TUS has been abducted.



Present location unknown.
No signal from Taylor's phone.



It's imperative we locate
and apprehend Taylor.



Son of a bitch.



He feII down.



Leave him.



It's me.



They bought it.



What about Barnes?



He took the bait.
He's pissing in the wind.



He's created a manhunt
for a shooter that doesn't exist.



Have you got Javier?
We may need him later.



I'm on my way.



I thought he was
supposed to be dead.



We need to tie up
aII of the Ioose ends.



Who's a Ioose end?



You are.



Give me the keys!



You're Iate.



Let's go, Iet's go!



ReIax.

vehicIe, registration Sierra-0 73654.



At present heading south,

Oh, my God. Mr. President?



Barnes? Is that you?



Mr. President.



I've got you.



-Can you sit up?
-Yeah.



Are you injured?



Yeah.



It's not important.



This is Agent Thomas Barnes.



POTUS is in hand.



I repeat, POTUS is in hand.



We need a pickup
seven bIocks east of the pIaza.



Thank you.



-Thank you.
-No probIem.



Bye, Anna, bye.



-HeIIo?
-Oh, thank God.

Back off, sir. Back off.



Thank you, Thomas.



You're weIcome, sir.



Reports out of Salamanca
now suggest...



...that the president
is out of intensive care.



His condition is listed as stable.



President Ashton
has made a point...



...of reassuring Americans
that he's all right...



...and the summit will continue
in the days to come.



MeanwhiIe, word from Spanish
and United States authorities...



...is that they've shot and kiIIed the Ione
assassin responsibIe for today's attack.



Our own Joan Kendrick has more.
