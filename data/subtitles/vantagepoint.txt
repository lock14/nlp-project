2
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:27,260
Good morning, America.

3
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:30,336
It's now 1 2 noon
in Salamanca, Spain.

4
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:33,797
In a short time, world leaders
from over 1 50 countries...

5
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:35,464
...meet here in Plaza Mayor...

6
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:39,169
...to sign up to President Ashton's
bold new counterterrorist strategy.

7
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:42,042
Since 9/ 1 1, more than 4500 people
have been killed...

8
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:44,683
...in the rising tide of global terror.

9
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:47,183
Those lives will not
soon be forgotten...

10
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:50,915
...as today, the world comes together
to take a stand against this violence.

11
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:53,651
We may be on the brink
of a historic agreement...

12
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:55,795
...between Western
and Arab leaders.

13
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:58,396
Security services are on high alert
in Salamanca...

14
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:01,796
...where we go live to our news team
and our reporter Angie Jones.

15
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,663
Five, four, three, two....

16
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:08,103
I am standing inside PIaza Mayor
in SaIamanca, Spain...

17
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:10,835
...where crowds have Iined up
for the kickoff of...

18
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,138
...what is without question
a landmark summit.

19
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:15,508
For months,
President Ashton's been working...

20
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:17,673
...with leaders
from five continents...

21
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:21,981
...to forge a new groundbreaking
alliance in the ongoing war on terror.

22
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,713
And now here, today...

23
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,586
... Western and Arab leaders
will meet for the first time...

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,887
...to formalize this new coalition...

25
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:30,962
...designed to once and for aII...

26
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,759
...put a strangIehoId
on internationaI terrorism.

27
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:35,060
-Bring him up.
-Cue Mark.

28
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:38,329
-Tell us, Angie, what's the mood like?
-For the most part, hopeful.

29
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:40,837
Everyone here is very
sympathetic to those...

30
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:43,100
...who lost loved ones
in the recent bombing.

31
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,176
I did, however, speak to delegates...

32
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:46,676
What's she doing?

33
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:50,510
...both of whom took a hard line,
suggesting that U.S. foreign policy...

34
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:51,844
Kevin, shut her down.

35
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,748
...has to bear some responsibility
for the recent events.

36
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:57,185
Thanks, Angie.
You'll have to keep us informed.

37
00:02:57,357 --> 00:03:00,451
- What the heII was that?
- Not everyone loves us, Rex.

38
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:04,358
Why don't you Ieave the punditry
to someone paid to have an opinion?

39
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:07,432
I'm cool with censorship.
I know the American people love that.

40
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:10,860
-Come on, Angie. Lighten up.
-Got it.

41
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,197
-GaIIery.
-Pass me over.

42
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:13,703
-Bruce.
-Yes.

43
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:16,934
-What was that? Stick to the script.
-I toId her. Wanna teII her?

44
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,270
-Fine.
-That's fine.

45
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,550
-Who is the cIown on two?
-Two is Luis.

46
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:29,313
Camera two, are you gonna move?

47
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,719
We're here for the summit,
not the sideshow.

48
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:35,620
Man, it's Iike training
a freaking dog.

49
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,691
Okay, everybody,
the president is about to arrive.

50
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:41,834
When he does, we're on him.
Let's get our ducks in a row.

51
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,537
Three, wider.
Four, stay where you are.

52
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,511
Kevin, keep it moving.
I'm dying here.

53
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:07,216
Camera five,
give me the motorcade.

54
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,890
Number seven, concentrate.
I wanna go cIose on the president.

55
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:17,498
AII right, sir.

56
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:20,632
That's good.

57
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,968
Tighten up, five. Good.

58
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,744
-Isn't that...?
-It's Thomas Barnes.

59
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:31,180
Why didn't we know he was here?
Shit, Grace. We shouId've had this.

60
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:32,682
Yeah, I don't....

61
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:35,412
-Kevin, puII the archives.
-PuII the archives, pIease.

62
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:38,251
The president's approaching
the pIaza. AII cameras ready.

63
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:39,687
Angie, we're back in 20.

64
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:43,158
And remember, we're here
for the summit, not the sideshow.

65
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,560
-There are other stories.
-I don't give a shit.

66
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:49,532
UnIess the protesters set themseIves
on fire, they're not our story.

67
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,743
-Kevin, you got it?
-Yeah.

68
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:03,442
Check this out.

69
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,952
This was onIy Iast year.
I can't beIieve he's back aIready.

70
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,426
If we're the onIy ones
who have this....

71
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:20,555
He won't taIk. A year ago we had HiII,
we had that guy who saved Reagan.

72
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:21,792
-McCarthy.
-AII of them.

73
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:24,368
A hero piece.
Barnes wanted nothing to do with it.

74
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:25,561
That was then.

75
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:29,971
It's a shame. It wouId've made a great
side story. We've no time to work it in.

76
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,975
That was then, this is now,
okay, guys? We've got our story.

77
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:36,477
Okay, cue graphics.

78
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,083
Camera five, give me a singIe.

79
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:40,913
-Here comes the mayor.
-Three, four, ready at the podium.

80
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:45,114
Three, wide. Four, in cIose. Start with
the Ieaders and end with the mayor.

81
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,782
-Thank you so much for being here.
-Three, puII back.

82
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:51,762
Yes. Camera six, get ready.
We're coming to you.

83
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,990
Good. That's good.

84
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,069
-Two, give me crowds.
-De Soto speech ending in one minute.

85
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:01,230
Camera five, give me something eIse
to work with. That's good.

86
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:04,900
Angie, when this is over,
I want a 1 5-second fiII to wrap it up.

87
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,672
-Keep it simpIe.
-You mean dumb it down?

88
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,439
Get off it, Angie. Come on.

89
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:10,913
She's unbeIievabIe.

90
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:13,109
I offer you my city....

91
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:16,187
The mayor's done in five.
Ready with the graphics.

92
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:18,984
This summit could be the
defining moment of his presidency.

93
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:20,854
PuII out, four, three--

94
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:24,995
Oh, my God.

95
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,226
The president appears
to have been shot.

96
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:30,527
-Shit.
-I heard two shots...

97
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,729
-...and the president fell.
-Who's that guy?

98
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:34,271
What's he doing?

99
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:37,535
Okay, five, stay with that guy.
Everyone eIse, give me Ashton.

100
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:40,475
Three, stick with the president.
Just stay with him.

101
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:44,111
That's good. Just stay with him.
Stay with him. HoId it there.

102
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:45,815
This is insane.

103
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,583
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming back.

104
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:50,416
-Camera three, do better.
-They're not letting me through.

105
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,717
Don't give me this buIIshit.
Figure it out.

106
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:54,425
Okay, you got him?

107
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:58,756
-What was that?
-There appears to be an explosion....

108
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:01,594
Camera four, turn around.
Find out what that was.

109
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:05,033
Kevin, get pIayback going. We have
to upIink everything we've got.

110
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,537
-Bruce.
-UpIink VTs 1 through 7 on my monitor.

111
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:11,574
Okay, Angie, you're on. Let's go.

112
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,072
We're Iive, Angie. This is it. Go.

113
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:17,878
I need a minute, Rex. All right?

114
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,643
Shit. Get Mark to stretch.

115
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,287
I know this is tough, okay?
I know that.

116
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:24,548
We need you to teII us
what's going on.

117
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,715
-Okay.
-Focus, okay?

118
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,827
Angie? Please, tell us
what you're seeing.

119
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:31,589
-Deep breath. Go.
-The president of the United States...

120
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:35,064
...has been shot.
There have been several gunshots.

121
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:38,932
It appears there was also a bomb
that went off outside the plaza.

122
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:40,663
There are people running scared--

123
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:43,966
Oh, shit!

124
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:56,177
Mark?

125
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:58,784
Mark, you gotta fiII.

126
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:01,992
It seems that a huge bomb....

127
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:05,427
Oh, my God. Angie! Angie!

128
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:07,691
At the moment,
smoke from the explosion...

129
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:10,802
...mercifully covers the extent
of the human carnage.

130
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,995
There must be many people dead
and injured.

131
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,164
-Angie.
-This truly is terrible.

132
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:17,036
Come on, kiddo, get up.

133
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:20,503
Get up.

134
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:29,620
Kevin, puII the feed.

135
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:32,420
Turn it off!

136
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,285
Good morning, America.

137
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:11,760
It's now 1 2 noon
in Salamanca, Spain.

138
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,559
In a short time, world leaders
from over 1 50 countries--

139
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:15,758
It's time.

140
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:18,199
--Plaza Mayor to sign up
to President Ashton's...

141
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:20,635
...bold new
counterterrorist strategy.

142
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:23,367
Since 9/ 1 1,
more than 4500 people...

143
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:26,137
...have been killed
in the rising tide of global terror.

144
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,644
Those lives will not
soon be forgotten, as today...

145
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:32,307
...the world comes together
to take a stand against this violence.

146
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,919
We may be on the brink
of a historic agreement...

147
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:37,022
...between Western
and Arab leaders.

148
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,317
Security services
are on high alert....

149
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,526
All teams, this is Control.

150
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:26,194
-Motorcade one minute to landing.
-Copy.

151
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:29,867
-Level 4B, clear.
-Roger, Control.

152
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,940
-It was before he Iost it.
-Come on.

153
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,206
-Guy had a nervous breakdown.
-Six months ago.

154
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:39,476
He's not that guy anymore.
Give him a break.

155
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,013
What are the chances he freaks out
the minute we waIk?

156
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:43,917
I'd put it at fifty-fifty.

157
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:50,326
We doing this?

158
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,666
Mr. President.

159
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:14,575
All teams, this is Control.
Eagle is on the move.

160
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,432
Tell us, Angie,
what's the mood there?

161
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,363
For the most part, hopeful.

162
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:31,901
Everyone here
is very sympathetic to those...

163
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:34,699
...who lost loved ones
in the recent bombing.

164
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:43,373
Thanks.

165
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:45,808
For what?

166
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:48,448
For getting me back out here.

167
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:52,989
Don't thank me yet.

168
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:12,902
Mr. President?

169
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,746
Here we go.

170
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:33,863
AII right, sir.

171
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:05,855
What a beautifuI baby.

172
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:10,360
Thank you.

173
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:13,298
Thank you so much.

174
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:15,706
It's a wonderfuI day.

175
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:21,845
Hey! Drop it.

176
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,043
Not now.

177
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:34,258
-MichaeI team's go for count off.
-AII cIear from above.

178
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:37,828

WeIcome. Thank you so much

181
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,859
This is a wondrous day.

182
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,894
Today, we make history.

183
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:21,869
Senor Presidente, feIIow members

184

187
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,951
And it is with a sad heart...

188
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:43,027
...that we must meet in mourning...

189
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:47,360
...for those who Iost Ioved ones

190
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,595
Back annex, the buiIding
shouId have been cIeared.

191
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,738
Copy. It's clear.

192
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:56,405
I've got a fIutter on the second fIoor.

193
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:00,302
Seventh window from the Ieft.

194
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,642
-Copy. We'll check again.
-The hopes of the worId...

195
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:06,284
...are with us.

196
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:09,046
Let us not disappoint them.

197
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:12,822
For we cannot today...

198
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:17,489
...or ever, Iet the specter of eviI...

199
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:21,565
...overcome the hope
of a better tomorrow.

200
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,068
It's just a fan that's been Ieft on.
We got it.

201
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:41,346
Therefore, I offer you my city,
my heart and my hope.

202
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,792
Barnes!

203
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:59,066
Barnes!

204
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,205
-Barnes!
-EagIe's down!

205
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,367
Repeat, EagIe's down!

206
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,346
Got a GSW. Repeat, GSW.

207
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:14,447
-Get him out of here!
-Move! Move!

208
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,054
Move him! Go! Go, go, go!

209
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,987
Pick him up! One, two, three.

210
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,456
You got him?

211
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,494
Find that shooter.

212
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:28,899
ControI, I want a perimeter
set a haIf bIock out.

213
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,059
Sweep the buiIdings
aIong the back annex.

214
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:33,398
No one goes in or out
without our go.

215
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:35,931
-Okay, you got him?
-Veronica!

216
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,405
-ControI.
-Do something!

217
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,874
Come in, ControI!
I need a 20 on POTUS.

218
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:43,106
ControI. Come in, ControI. Damn it!

219
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:46,410
-Listen to me!
-I said back up! Hey, shut up!

220
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:49,076
Listen! We are in danger.
We gotta get out of here!

221
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:50,984
Now, get up! I said get up!

222
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:52,749
-Let me have him.
-Let me go.

223
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:54,085
Barnes.

224
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,593
Why'd you run for the president?
Why did you run for the president?

225
00:16:57,763 --> 00:16:59,890
-Barnes, we're handIing this.
-I hear bang.

226
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,591
-I protect the mayor. It's my job!
-You got there pretty fast.

227
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:05,293
-Barnes, he's a cop.
-I don't care, he knows something!

228
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:07,098
Get him out of here! Get him out.

229
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,401
Don't reIease him!

230
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:12,373
I've been set up!
You got the wrong person!

231
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:16,709
ControI. ControI, come in.

232
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:18,440
There's no response from ControI.

233
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:21,108
I just spoke with them.
POTUS is secure.

234
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:26,053
TiII we find that shooter,
we're shutting the city down.

235
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,792
This never shouId've happened.

236
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,451
Except that it did.
And it happened on our watch.

237
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,128
I can't Iive with that.

238
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:34,622
We gotta find him.

239
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,935
-Sir, we need your camera.
-Sure.

240
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,303
-Where's the zoom?
-It's that right here.

241
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,910
Right there.
That's where the fIutter was.

242
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,949
But the shot was up and to the Ieft.

243
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:52,482
Wait, you saw the shooter?

244
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:56,477
No. But I saw something.
Like a fIash of Iight.

245
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:59,317
-I saw a man in that room, sir.
-I'II check it out.

246
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:01,483
-I'm coming with you.
-No! No.

247
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:03,718
If you're wrong, Iet me take the heat.

248
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,321
Sir, did you fiIm this entire thing?

249
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:07,966
-Yes.
-Show me.

250
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:13,463
I think I got the shooter on tape.

251
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:16,503
Wait, go forward.

252
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:23,139
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
There's a bomb at the podium!

253
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:04,112
There's a bomb at the podium!

254
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,757
Everybody get down!

255
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,122
This never should've happened.

256
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:09,522
Find that shooter.

257
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,257
Flash of light.

258
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:22,372
Find that shooter.

259
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:39,749
He just waIked. He just waIked.

260
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,696
Medic! We need a medic here!

261
00:19:44,864 --> 00:19:46,161
Barnes.

262
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:48,924
We're gonna get you
some heIp, buddy.

263
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:58,435
Barnes? Barnes.

264
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,278
Anna?

265
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:09,449
Hey! Hey, stop him! Stop him!

266
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:11,246
Stop! Stop!

267
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,714
Hey, freeze!

268
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:38,781
Secret Service.
I need to see your tapes.

269
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:40,782
Yeah. Kevin.

270
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:44,652
I need to see any footage you have
of the back part of the pIaza.

271
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:47,257
-We need footage of the pIaza.
-How much do you need?

272
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:49,451
Just give me everything.

273
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:02,501
Can you hear me?
Camera three, can you hear me?

274
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:05,140
Just pIay it back from there.
Yeah.

275
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,411
-Barnes, you were right.
-About what?

276
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,913
About the shooter. I'm in pursuit,
leaving the back annex, heading west.

277
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,573
Repeat, heading west.

278
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,878
-Did you caII it in?
-No. No, I need you to.

279
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,646
-I got it. Go.
-Camera seven.

280
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:21,157
Camera seven. This is Grace,
can you hear me?

281
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,861
-Camera seven, can you hear me?
-ControI? Come in, ControI.

282
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,532
ControI, come in.

283
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,258
-I need you to teII us--
-Damn it.

284
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:31,835
Okay. We need you to teII us
where you are.

285
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:35,838
This is Agent Barnes. ControI is down.
My partner is in pursuit of a suspect.

286
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:39,102
We need immediate assistance
just outside the back annex.

287
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:40,836
Grace, they have a suspect.

288
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:42,742
Headed west on the surface streets.

289
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:44,710
-West.
-Do you copy?

290
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:48,284
Camera six, if you can hear me,
turn around and go west.

291
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:51,423
Camera six, if you can hear me,
turn around and go west.

292
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:53,214
Backup is on its--

293
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,084
What?

294
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:58,129
Barnes, what is it?

295
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:01,794
Rewind that.

296
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:04,800
Six? Six, did you get aII that?

297
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:07,502
Stop.

298
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:14,038
Oh, my God.

299
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,574
What? What? What did he see?

300
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:56,286
Next.

301
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:58,889
PoIice, I work for the mayor.

302
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:01,220
Are you armed?

303
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,629
Are you armed?

304
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,925
Yes.

305
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:11,834
Okay, I'II turn it off. Go through.

306
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:19,172
I'II be at the underpass.

307
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:35,489
You have a gIow about you.

308
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,853
It's the heat.

309
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:39,889
The heat?

310
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:43,361
What have you been doing?

311
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:44,695
Nothing.

312
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,996
Taking in the crowd.

313
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,139
Some more than others?

314
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:51,440
I saw you just now.

315
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,010
-You saw nothing.
-It didn't Iook Iike nothing.

316
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,706
You don't have to worry about him,
I promise.

317
00:23:58,517 --> 00:23:59,609
Enrique.

318
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:02,720
You're the one that I want,
there is no one eIse.

319
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:06,483
How many ways do I need to say it?

320
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:14,956
When you've finished here we'II go
away together, just you and me.

321
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:17,059
I Iove you.

322
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:21,305
Did you remember to bring my bag?

323
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:24,335
Thank you.

324
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,907
-I Iove you.
-I Iove you.

325
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:40,084
Ladies and gentIemen,

00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:43,225
President Henry Ashton.

327
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:53,599
Mr. Mayor, this is a great day.
It's an honor to be here.

328

00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,183
This is a wondrous day.

Today, we make history.

I'II be at the underpass.

332
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:30,432
You don't have to worry about him,
I promise.

333
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,837
You're the one that I want,

00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:02,472
Get him out of here!

337
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,074
Let's go, move it! Let's go!

338
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:06,677
-Get moving!
-Let me go! I work for the mayor!

339
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,673
-Shut up and move!

Let's go. Who are you?

342
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:17,382
Hey! Who are you?

00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:22,152

Look at me, Iook at me! Look at me!

345
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,363
Why did you run?

346
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,161
Answer the question.

347
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,541

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,845
We have to go!
She threw something!

352
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:52,513
Gun. It's Ioaded.

353
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:55,292

354
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,155

00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:09,637
Listen to me! We are in danger!

360
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:12,208
We gotta get out of here!
We have to go!

361
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:17,045
Why'd you run for the president?
Why did you run for the president?

362
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:20,116
I hear bang. I go to protect the mayor.
It's my job.

363
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:22,276
-You got there pretty fast.
-He's a cop.

364
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:25,014
-I don't care, he knows something!
-Get him out of here!

365
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,284
I've been set up!
You got the wrong person!

366
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:30,524
Do not reIease him!

367
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:52,275
Medic! We need a medic here!

368
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:57,179
HoIden.

369
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:05,922

00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,933
Hey! Stop him!

00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:10,558
Hey, freeze!

372
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:12,830
Out of the way! Out of the way!

373
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:15,838
Freeze! Stop! I said freeze!

374
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:17,100
Damn it!

375
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:23,775
Get out the way! Get out the way!

376
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:28,348
Stop him! Stop him!
Someone stop him!

377
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:39,756

379
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:50,268

00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:53,804
Move!

381
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:56,575
Let's go!

382
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:04,480
Move! Move!

383
00:29:16,368 --> 00:29:18,302
Out the way. Out the way!

Get out of the way! PoIice!

00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:24,799
Out of the way!

386
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:34,516
Shit.

387
00:29:37,122 --> 00:29:38,146
Out the way!

388
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,597
Surprised to see me aIive?

389
00:30:58,403 --> 00:30:59,893
It's amazing.

390
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,005
HeIIo.

391
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:08,070
-HeIIo, how are you?
-Okay.

392
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:11,076
Excuse me.

393
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:57,792
What are you seeing?

394
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:00,755
-Speak EngIish.
-I try.

395
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:03,332
I'm just watching
aII the peopIe up there.

396
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:06,363
Hi. My name is Sam.
Nice to meet you.

397
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:08,130

Nice to meet you too.

398
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:10,297
-American?
-Yeah.

399
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:15,104
-What brings you here?
-Just Iooking for a IittIe excitement.

400
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,771
-First time, huh?
-Europe? Yeah.

401
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:20,816
Yeah, it just feIt Iike it was
the right time. What about you?

402
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:23,082
I go where the moment takes me.

403
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:25,681
That must be nice. No famiIy, right?

404
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:27,188
No.

405
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:29,023
None that I know of.

406
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:31,685
Things change when
you got kids running around.

407
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:33,524
Are yours with you?

408
00:32:34,032 --> 00:32:37,729
No, they're with their mother. We're
going through a bad patch right now.

409
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:41,134
I needed to get away for
a IittIe whiIe, give us some space.

410
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,201
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-It's fine, it's fine.

411
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,911
I think it's my cue.

412
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:51,605
Yeah. It's nice to meet you.

413
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,478

00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,653

-Hey, teII him your name.

417
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:07,724
That's a pretty name.

418
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:10,459
You Iook about the same age
as my son, Nathan.

419
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:12,769
Can I buy her another cone?

420
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:15,963
-No, no, no, it's okay. Thank you.
-No, reaIIy, reaIIy.

421
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:17,267
No, no, it's okay.

422
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,433
-PIease, Mom?
-That's enough, I said no.

423
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:22,579
Anna?

424
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:24,347
I'm sorry.

425
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:36,760
Ladies and gentIemen,

426
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:39,496

It is with great pIeasure that
I invite you aII to our humbIe city.

431
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,330
The hopes of the worId are with us.

432
00:34:18,303 --> 00:34:19,930
We must come together...

433
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:22,400
...on this day...

434
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:25,503
...in this renowned pIace...

435
00:34:25,677 --> 00:34:27,474
...to band together for peace.

436
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:30,580
I don't think he's supposed to be
up there. What's he doing?

437
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:35,880
Therefore, I offer you my city,
my heart and my hope.

438
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:38,648
What's he doing up there?

439
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:58,005
Get him!

440
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,803
EagIe's down, EagIe's down!

441
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:03,106
We got a GSW. Repeat, GSW.
We gotta Ieave right now.

442
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:05,215
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

443
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:07,442
Let's go! Move him!
Go! Go, go, go!

444
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,678
-One, two, three.
-You got him?

445
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,048
-Let me go!
-Move!

446
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:12,780
Shut up! Move it!

447
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:16,683
-Let me go!
-What were you doing up there?

448
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:18,986
Hey! Answer the goddamn question.

449
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:20,597
Veronica!

450
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:21,857
Veronica!

451
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:23,432
We have to go!

452
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:27,560
PIease! Listen to me!
We have to go!

453
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:28,763
Hey. Step away, sir.

454
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,135
-She threw something.
-Gun. It's Ioaded.

455
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:34,710
-Hey! Back up, sir!
-Listen to me! He's teIIing the truth.

456
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,779
Veronica. Veronica!

457
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:47,690
Anna! Anna!

458
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,404
Hi, leave a message.

459
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:05,202
Pam. It's me.

460
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:08,811
ProbabIy waking you up, it's just--

461
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,780
You'II see on the news when you
wake up that the president's been shot.

462
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:17,880
He was here in Spain, and I think
I just saw the guy who did it.

463
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:21,116
Look, Iook. I'm aII right, aII right?

464
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:25,023
I just want you to Iet the kids know
that I'm fine...

465
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:26,993
...and that I Iove them
very much and--

466
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:30,127
Oh, man. I can't beIieve
what I just saw.

467
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:31,962
And I think I got it aII on tape.

468
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:34,195
I don't know what to do,
but the right--

469
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:35,669
Sir, we need your camera.

470
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:38,107
-Sure.
-Where's the zoom?

471
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:40,009
Press this button right there.

472
00:36:40,178 --> 00:36:43,477
Yeah. That's--
That's where the fIutter was.

473
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,617
But the shot was up to the Ieft.

474
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:50,151
-You saw the shooter?
-I saw something, Iike a fIash of Iight.

475
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:53,154
Right there. There was something
in that window right there.

476
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:55,986
-I saw a man in that room, sir.
-I'II go check it out.

477
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,128
-I'm coming with you.
-No! No.

478
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,264
If you're wrong, Iet me take the heat.

479
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:04,726
-Sir, did you fiIm this entire thing?
-Yes, I did.

480
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:05,927
Show me.

481
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:13,310
I think I got the shooter on tape.

482
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:17,913
Wait, go forward.

483
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,955
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
There's a bomb at the podium!

484
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:11,129
Medic! We need a medic here!

485
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:26,775
Anna?

486
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:29,445
Anna!

487
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,248
Where's your mother?
Where is she?

488
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:36,916
Everybody evacuate
the pIaza, okay?

489
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:39,387
-Come with me.
-Okay.

490
00:38:39,564 --> 00:38:42,431
I gotta get you somewhere safe,
then we'II find your mother.

491
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:54,404
Someone stop him!

492
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:56,478
HoId it!

493
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:00,510

494
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:02,583
Hey! Hey! Get out the way!

495
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:05,585
Stop him! Get out the way!

496
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,151
Stop him!

497
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:11,420
Anyone, stop him!
HeIp us! Someone heIp!

498
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:21,531
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I need your heIp.

499
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:25,642
I need you to watch her. Her mother's
gone, I don't know where she is.

500
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,141
She'II be safe with me.

501
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:30,610
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm gonna be right back.

502
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:33,341
I've got to heIp the poIice.

503
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:36,146

Don't worry, we'II find your mom,

00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:57,271

00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:42,979
Move! Move, move, move!

512
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,228
Move! Quick!

513
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:54,488
Turn Ieft, I got right!

514
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:56,299
Move!

515
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:51,345
He's a cop.

516
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:53,653
He's a cop.

517
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:02,798
Freeze!

518
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:09,495
He shot him. He shot him.

519
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,409
Anna. Anna.

520
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:29,416
Anna!

521
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:38,999
Anna!

522
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:09,759
When do we think
the changes wiII be ready?

523
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:12,095
It's not Iike I have to make
a speech now.

524
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:16,438
I couId just wing it. How much troubIe
couId I reaIIy get myseIf into?

525
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:22,576
Thanks. Nice to know
we both know my Iimitations.

526
00:43:26,217 --> 00:43:28,208
-We're stopping?
-Yes, sir.

527
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:37,987
Rick, I'II caII you back.

528
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:44,195
The NSA's just confirmed the threat.

529
00:43:44,802 --> 00:43:47,532
-Control, handoff complete.
-Roger, point man.

530
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:53,500
Where's PhiI?

531
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:56,272
The hoteI.
He's on with the Joint Chiefs.

532
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,716
He's sending the doubIe, isn't he?

533
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,384
Yeah.

534
00:44:01,686 --> 00:44:03,278
We're moving POTUS to the hoteI.

535
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:07,186
ControI, we've N.D.'d the car.
POTUS is returning.

536
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:10,724
We issue a statement that we're
deferring to Prime Minister Gutierrez--

537
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:12,260
Deferring, that's great.

538
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,160
Control, E TA to castle
is two minutes.

539
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,665
Today of aII days.

540
00:44:18,202 --> 00:44:19,294
Christ.

541
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,870
Sir, we've used doubIes
since Reagan.

542
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:27,771
That was for photo ops.
Not for anything this big.

543
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:33,008
Control, we have PO TUS
and we are moving to the castle.

544
00:44:39,657 --> 00:44:41,648
Eagle has arrived at the plaza.

545
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:52,600
Control, we have PO TUS
and are entering the castle.

546
00:45:04,682 --> 00:45:06,445
-Sir.
-TaIk to me, PhiI.

547
00:45:06,617 --> 00:45:08,608
NSA caIIed it five minutes ago.
It's reaI.

548
00:45:08,786 --> 00:45:11,949
And the summit? You're not
thinking of puIIing out entireIy?

549
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:13,215
Why wouId we?

550
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:16,524
Do we know who's behind this?

551
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:19,754
A IocaI group with a vague connection
to the Mujahedin Brigade.

552
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,194
-Why issue the threat now?
-U.S. SpeciaI Forces...

553
00:45:22,366 --> 00:45:25,028
...uncovered a pIot to smuggIe
a bomb out of Morocco.

554
00:45:25,202 --> 00:45:28,729
We took their bomb and their men,
and this may be their retaIiation.

555
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:31,439
You think trying to kiII me
is a retaIiation.

556
00:45:40,818 --> 00:45:42,285
POTUS is moving.

557
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:45,184
Safe for Eagle to exit vehicle.

558
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:46,482
Copy that.

559
00:46:01,505 --> 00:46:02,767
This is them?

560
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,774
That's Benwar Suarez. As near
as we can teII, he Ieads the group.

561
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:09,168
And what do we know about him?

562
00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:11,678
He's from Morocco,
educated in Paris.

563
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:15,148
He went off the map for awhiIe,
but he surfaced in Beirut, Darfur.

564
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:18,818
CoupIe days ago we intercepted an
e-maiI between members of his group.

565
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:21,981
Embedded in it were Iinks to maps,
bIueprints of the area.

566
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,354
It was this morning
that we received the threat.

567
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:26,587
The Joint Chiefs,
what do they recommend?

568
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:29,062
That we go after their Ieadership.

569
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:30,666
Here in Spain?

570
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:33,861
Morocco.

571
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:38,064
We have a sateIIite Iock
on one of their camps there.

572
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,839
You want me to caII in a strike
on a friendIy Arab nation?

573
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:44,344
They're harboring terrorists.

574
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:54,853
-And this inteI, we're certain--?
-AbsoIuteIy.

575
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,826
ControI, we're cIear on seven.

576
00:46:56,994 --> 00:46:59,861
Why not focus on the ones
who are here actuaIIy doing this?

577
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,361
This summit is too important.

578
00:47:01,532 --> 00:47:04,695
But we're Iooking for five peopIe
out of 6 miIIion. We are trying.

579
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:05,961
Try harder.

580
00:47:12,376 --> 00:47:17,006
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States:

581
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:19,513
President Henry Ashton.

582
00:47:22,453 --> 00:47:25,251
A wonderfuI day. Some words now.

583
00:47:30,794 --> 00:47:31,818
WeIcome.

584
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:35,031
This is a wondrous day.

585
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,891
Today, we make history.

586
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:43,538
-He doesn't even Iook Iike me.
-Senor Presidente...

587
00:47:44,241 --> 00:47:47,233
...fellow members
of the European Union...

588
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:48,742
...President Ashton...

589
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:51,177
...and citizens of the world...

590
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:56,342
...it is with great pleasure that
I invite you all to our humble city.

591
00:47:57,488 --> 00:47:58,921
Is that Thomas?

592
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:00,181
Yes, sir.

593
00:48:01,058 --> 00:48:03,026
I thought he was stiII inactive.

594
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:04,525
He was.

595
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,089
WeII, if he's back,
why isn't he with me?

596
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:11,857
We weren't sure if he was ready.

597
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:18,166
-You sent him out there.
-We need someone to seII the doubIe.

598
00:48:18,342 --> 00:48:21,539
SeII? He took a buIIet for me, PhiI.

599
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:23,339
And Iook at him.

600
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:28,942
He hasn't stopped
punishing himseIf since.

601
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,110
I Iiked him every bit
as much as you did.

602
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:33,722
But we needed to know
we couId count on him again.

603
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:36,416
So you threw him out there
to see if he couId?

604
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:39,427
That's how we treat
our friends now?

605
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:41,989
Therefore...

606
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:47,234
...I offer you my city,
my heart and my hope.

607
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:51,575
This summit could very well be the
defining moment of his presidency.

608
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,404
Jesus!

609
00:48:58,048 --> 00:49:00,073
The president appears
to have been shot.

610
00:49:00,451 --> 00:49:04,319
I heard two shots,
and the president fell.

611
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:06,619
Get the Joint Chiefs on the Iine now.

612
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:10,692
AdmiraI Houston, it's McCuIIough.
Have you seen the situation?

613
00:49:10,861 --> 00:49:12,158
The president is secure.

614
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:13,489
Get him out of here!

615
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:16,764
How Iong do we have to get
the birds in the air?

616
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:18,434
So you're ready to strike now?

617
00:49:21,305 --> 00:49:22,897
Mr. President.

618
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:24,472
Sir.

619
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:26,733
Mr. President.

620
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:30,339
The Chiefs have a sateIIite Iock
on their viIIage. They're ready.

621
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:32,807
Sir?

622
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:35,008
Ted?

623
00:49:35,452 --> 00:49:38,353
-There's an issue of when we can go.
-We go now.

624
00:49:38,522 --> 00:49:41,355
You can't give the order.
You've been shot.

625
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:45,390
We go now, we risk teIIing the worId
that you weren't there.

626
00:49:45,562 --> 00:49:47,052
We weren't there, Ted.

627
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:49,198
Get the vice president to do it.

628
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:52,233
No, we are not going near
the 25th Amendment.

629
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:58,064
TeII Rick to work up a story
I was shot, but I'm okay.

630
00:49:58,242 --> 00:49:59,300
That's not gonna fIy.

631
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:02,536
If we have to go to some hospitaI
and put on a show, we do it.

632
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:04,408
-We have to taIk--
-I'm done taIking!

633
00:50:05,883 --> 00:50:07,441
Christ!

634
00:50:10,354 --> 00:50:12,879
Sir, we gotta go now.
We have to attack.

635
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:14,115
Sir?

636
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:18,785
Cavic, find out what's
going on down there.

637
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,494
Mr. President, pIease step away
from the gIass.

638
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:27,363
-Cavic to ControI.
-Mr. President.

639
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:32,804
TeII them to stand down.

640
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:34,409
Sir, we have to respond!

641
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:37,638
Bombing a camp in Morocco wiII
bIow this summit out of the water.

642
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:40,375
That is what the peopIe
behind this want me to do.

643
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:42,678
Mr. President,
we have to act strong.

644
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:44,980
No, we have to be strong.

645
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:47,715
They sent us a warning
because they want us to react.

646
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:49,051
They know our pIaybook.

647
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:52,489
They're banking on us doing
what we aIways do. We wiII hit back.

648
00:50:52,663 --> 00:50:55,188
We have the worId's sympathy
right now.

649
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:59,396
Let's honor that. Let's finish
what we came here to do.

650
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,265
Okay, copy that.

651
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:04,032
Everything is being prepared
to transport the president.

652
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:06,676
We need to get the president
to Air Force One now.

653
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:09,540
I'm done hiding.
This is the president, is my wife there?

654
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,045
-We have to be better than this.
-Sir.

655
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:16,547
-Yeah, get Air Force One ready....
-Kay, it's me.

656
00:51:17,755 --> 00:51:19,746
No, we're fine here. We're safe.

657
00:51:57,161 --> 00:52:01,427
Good morning, America. It's now
1 2 noon in Salamanca, Spain.

658
00:52:01,598 --> 00:52:04,692
In a short time, world leaders
from over 1 50 countries...

659
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:06,927
...meet here in Plaza Mayor....

660
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:08,331
You Iike it?

661
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:12,537
Thank you.
AII right, then. Let's eat and waIk?

662
00:52:15,045 --> 00:52:17,570
Security services are on high alert
here in Salamanca.

663
00:52:17,748 --> 00:52:21,741
We go live to our news team on the
ground and our reporter Angie Jones.

664
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:26,219
I am standing inside Plaza Mayor
in Salamanca, Spain.

665
00:52:30,994 --> 00:52:32,962
I thought you'd want it for Iuck.

666
00:52:38,101 --> 00:52:39,762
I want to know he's okay.

667
00:52:46,844 --> 00:52:48,709
This was taken 1 5 minutes ago.

668
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:51,780
You wouId find that we are
taking good care of your brother--

669
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:54,942
What have you done to him?

670
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:57,245
He's stiII in one piece.

671
00:52:57,421 --> 00:52:59,013
You shouId be happy about that.

672
00:53:01,058 --> 00:53:03,993
Do what you're supposed to do
and your brother wiII be fine.

673
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:08,063
If you faiI, then this wouId be the Iast
thing you have to remember him by--

674
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:14,504
You Iook out for yourseIf.

675
00:53:17,074 --> 00:53:18,837
I'II be at the underpass.

676
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:44,901
Luis, stick with the protestors.
We never see this side of the story.

677
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:46,433
Are you gonna move or what?

678
00:53:46,603 --> 00:53:49,902
I've got her Iecturing me now.

679
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:53,400
We're here for the conference
not the sideshow.

680
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:57,675
Is everything going to pIan?

681
00:53:58,415 --> 00:54:00,178
To the Iast detaiI.

682
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:01,408
And the president?

683
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:03,643
Are you sure they sent a doubIe?

684
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:05,782
The beauty of American arrogance...

685
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:10,222
...is that they cannot imagine a worId
where they're not a step ahead.

686
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:16,726
Has the package arrived?

687
00:54:18,735 --> 00:54:21,101
-As we speak.
-Perfect.

688
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:22,465
Javier will be by.

689
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:23,867
Understood.

690
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:25,235
Felipe.

691
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:28,435
You wiII make us very proud.

692
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:39,983
Control, we have PO TUS
and are entering the castle.

693
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:42,555
Copy that.
Eagle has arrived at the plaza.

694
00:54:44,728 --> 00:54:46,127
-Javier.
-Yeah.

695
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:47,621
Are you in position?

696
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:49,594
-I'm on my way.
-Good.

697
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:53,566
For the moment, the Americans think
they've dodged a buIIet. Do not be Iate.

698
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:56,297
-Don't worry about me.
-I won't.

699
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,632
Your brother spoke very highIy
of your SpeciaI Forces training.

700
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:02,842
Do not disappoint him.

701
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:10,282
You just make sure my brother
wiII be at the underpass.

702
00:55:15,325 --> 00:55:17,122
How's our boy doing?

703
00:55:19,863 --> 00:55:21,194
Are we go?

704
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:37,879
Good day.

705
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:44,420
Good day, sir.

706
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,758
ControI, we have an active
crossing the Iobby.

707
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,069
-Honey, I'm coming up to the room.
-He's cIear. Area secure.

708
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:45,272
What are you seeing?

709
00:57:12,476 --> 00:57:14,535
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-It's fine, it's fine.

710
00:57:23,854 --> 00:57:25,321
I think it's my cue.

711
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:26,979
Yeah. It's nice to meet you.

712
00:57:27,157 --> 00:57:29,819
-Best of Iuck.
-AII right. To you too.

713
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:39,631
Senor Presidente...

714
00:57:39,803 --> 00:57:42,670
...feIIow members
of the European Union...

715
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:45,935
...our friends from Africa,
MiddIe East...

716
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:47,576
Let's make ourseIves a shooter.

717
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:50,645
...President Ashton,
citizens of the worId...

718
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:55,713
...it is with great pIeasure
that I invite you aII to our humbIe city.

719
00:57:57,521 --> 00:58:01,116
And it is with a sad heart...

720
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:03,225
...that we must meet in mourning...

721
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:07,693
...for those who Iost Ioved ones
in the recent bombings.

722
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:12,524
-That shouId keep him occupied.
-Today, we stand together...

723
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:17,570
...and what we achieve here
wiII be remembered forever.

724
00:58:30,187 --> 00:58:32,781
-Crowd detail, hostile check.
-All clear from above.

725
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:40,487
-Javier. Are you good to go?
-This is ControI. Keep us updated.

726
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:46,533
We must come together
on this day...

727
00:58:46,703 --> 00:58:48,864
...in this renowned pIace...

728
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:53,506
...to band together for peace.

729
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:54,968
Therefore...

730
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:59,609
...I offer you my city, my heart
and my hope.

731
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,758
We gotta get EagIe out now.

732
00:59:18,235 --> 00:59:20,169
EagIe's down! EagIe's down!

733
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:23,804
We got a GSW!
Let's go, move it! Move it!

734
00:59:30,647 --> 00:59:33,013
--control of the building
along the back--

735
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:38,051
-ControI room cIeared.
-Do you have the frequency?

736
00:59:38,221 --> 00:59:40,246
Four, one, nine, one, zero.

737
00:59:43,093 --> 00:59:44,788
No one goes in or out
without our go.

738
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:48,392
Control. Come in, Control.
I need a 20 on PO TUS.

739
00:59:48,565 --> 00:59:50,362
ControI. Come in, ControI.

740
00:59:51,534 --> 00:59:53,661
-Move it! Go!
-ControI!

741
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:24,264
Take care of him.

742
01:00:43,954 --> 01:00:45,148
Let's go.

743
01:01:08,712 --> 01:01:10,339
ControI?

744
01:01:10,547 --> 01:01:12,378
Come in, ControI.

745
01:01:13,683 --> 01:01:15,583
ControI, are you there?

746
01:01:26,396 --> 01:01:30,355
This is ControI. We have agents down.
I repeat, agents down.

747
01:01:30,533 --> 01:01:33,832
We have a situation at the front
requiring immediate backup.

748
01:01:34,004 --> 01:01:35,528
Copy, ControI.

749
01:01:41,144 --> 01:01:44,011
Coming to the Iobby to assist.
ETA, 30 seconds.

750
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,080
Come on, guys. Move, move, move!

751
01:01:56,259 --> 01:01:58,090
What's the status on level seven?

752
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:00,126
BIue team's cIear on seven.

753
01:02:28,525 --> 01:02:31,756
Get Air Force One ready and send
a chopper. We can get out of here.

754
01:02:31,928 --> 01:02:34,158
No, we're fine. We're safe.

755
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:48,804
Get up! Get up!

756
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:55,977
Multiple casualties.
Repeat, multiple casualties.

757
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:07,160
Hey.

758
01:03:07,697 --> 01:03:10,894
We need your heIp. Now.

759
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:16,396
Come on. He's over here.
We've done everything we can.

760
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,398
He's got no puIse.

761
01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:23,637
Secret Service.

762
01:03:23,813 --> 01:03:26,077
-I need to see your tapes.
-Yeah.

763
01:03:26,382 --> 01:03:28,976
I need to see any footage
of the back of the pIaza.

764
01:03:29,152 --> 01:03:31,120
We need footage
of the back of the pIaza.

765
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,179
Again.

766
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:36,256
Two. Again.

767
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:44,157
-Washington, this is Agent Barnes.
-Go ahead.

768
01:03:44,334 --> 01:03:46,962
ControI is down. My partner
is in pursuit of a suspect.

769
01:03:47,137 --> 01:03:49,605
We need immediate assistance
outside the back annex.

770
01:03:49,772 --> 01:03:51,706
-Give me a heading.
-They have a suspect.

771
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:53,934
Headed west on surface streets.
Do you copy?

772
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:55,168
West, copy that.

773
01:03:55,478 --> 01:03:58,970
Camera six, if you can hear me,
turn around and go west.

774
01:03:59,315 --> 01:04:00,839
Backup is on its--

775
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:03,110
What? Barnes, what is it?

776
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:04,977
Barnes.

777
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:09,881
Oh, my God.

778
01:04:13,396 --> 01:04:14,693
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

779
01:04:14,864 --> 01:04:16,729
If you're wrong, Iet me take the heat.

780
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:44,520
-Barnes, you were right.
-About what?

781
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:48,494
About the shooter. I'm in pursuit,
Ieaving the back annex, heading west.

782
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:52,491
What?

783
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:54,494
Barnes, what is it?

784
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:56,862
Barnes.

785
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:28,703
Hey!

786
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:34,108
Secret Service, get out of the car.
Get-- Get out of the car.

787
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:40,376
-Washington.
-This is Barnes.

788
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,645
Look, I know how this is gonna sound,
but Agent TayIor has gone rogue.

789
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:46,413
CaII the other agents back.

790
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:49,581
I know I made the caII,
but there's something eIse going on.

791
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:53,420
-Barnes.
-ControI is compromised.

792
01:05:53,596 --> 01:05:56,121
-All agents are heading west.
-Listen to me! Damn it!

793
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:58,493
Goddamn it!

794
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:24,558
Let him go.

795
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:26,627
What are you taIking about?

796
01:06:26,796 --> 01:06:31,665
My brother. I've done my part.
Now you Iet him go.

797
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:33,329
Put the gun down.

798
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:38,839
Make the caII. Or I puII the trigger,
and your pIan's finished.

799
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,634
Again.

800
01:06:43,479 --> 01:06:44,605
Again.

801
01:06:45,782 --> 01:06:47,374
Go ahead.

802
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:49,875
Do it.

803
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:54,314
Do it and your brother is dead.

804
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:59,291
Can you Iive with that? Knowing that
your brother died because of you?

805
01:07:00,463 --> 01:07:02,328
Javier, Iisten to me.

806
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:05,934
He's going to be deIivered
at the underpass.

807
01:07:06,402 --> 01:07:07,926
Don't mess it up now.

808
01:07:09,972 --> 01:07:11,701
You'II get your brother back.

809
01:07:19,482 --> 01:07:20,506
Nothing....

810
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:27,187
Nothing had better happen to him.

811
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:31,617
Nothing wiII.

812
01:07:42,238 --> 01:07:43,728
Shit.

813
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,532
Washington.

814
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:49,371
This is Barnes. I've Iost Agent TayIor.
I need a GPS Iocation on his ceIIuIar.

815
01:07:49,545 --> 01:07:50,876
Copy that.

816
01:07:59,088 --> 01:08:01,750
HoId him. HoId him.
Thank you, he's gonna be aII right.

817
01:08:01,924 --> 01:08:03,414
Veronica.

818
01:08:22,845 --> 01:08:24,369
I'm here.

819
01:08:32,922 --> 01:08:34,082
We did it.

820
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:36,050
Not yet.

821
01:08:45,868 --> 01:08:48,428
-Yeah.
-Barnes, PO TUS has been abducted.

822
01:08:48,604 --> 01:08:51,732
Present location unknown.
No signal from Taylor's phone.

823
01:08:51,908 --> 01:08:54,843
It's imperative we locate
and apprehend Taylor.

824
01:08:55,478 --> 01:08:56,570
Son of a bitch.

825
01:09:19,702 --> 01:09:21,067
He feII down.

826
01:09:21,804 --> 01:09:23,066
Leave him.

827
01:09:26,108 --> 01:09:27,132
It's me.

828
01:09:28,177 --> 01:09:29,269
They bought it.

829
01:09:29,445 --> 01:09:30,605
What about Barnes?

830
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:33,606
He took the bait.
He's pissing in the wind.

831
01:09:34,316 --> 01:09:37,217
He's created a manhunt
for a shooter that doesn't exist.

832
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,847
Have you got Javier?
We may need him later.

833
01:09:40,022 --> 01:09:41,489
I'm on my way.

834
01:09:54,103 --> 01:09:56,628
I thought he was
supposed to be dead.

835
01:09:59,174 --> 01:10:01,233
We need to tie up
aII of the Ioose ends.

836
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:03,972
Who's a Ioose end?

837
01:10:05,514 --> 01:10:06,538
You are.

838
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:31,834
Give me the keys!

839
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:43,710
You're Iate.

840
01:10:57,032 --> 01:10:58,863
Let's go, Iet's go!

841
01:10:59,034 --> 01:11:00,262
ReIax.

842
01:11:00,436 --> 01:11:01,494
We've puIIed it off.

843
01:11:15,517 --> 01:11:17,542
This is Agent Barnes.
I've Iocated TayIor.

844
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:22,748
He's driving a SaIamanca poIice
vehicIe, registration Sierra-0 73654.

845
01:11:22,925 --> 01:11:26,417
At present heading south,
repeat, south, on CaIIe de San PabIo.

846
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:32,629
That Iooks bad.

847
01:11:34,937 --> 01:11:38,134
We've waited too Iong for this.

848
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:40,673
Thank God this doubIe Iife
is aImost over.

849
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:42,401
Just get me to my brother.

850
01:11:56,892 --> 01:11:58,655
Christ. It's Barnes.

851
01:12:14,009 --> 01:12:15,101
Got company.

852
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:17,636

854
01:12:19,615 --> 01:12:21,048
I'm working on it.

855
01:12:36,465 --> 01:12:38,126
Come on, come on, come on!

856
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,597

01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:07,391
Oh, shit. Shit, shit!

858
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:36,617
Shit.

859
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:50,194
Shit!

860
01:13:53,609 --> 01:13:55,201
Have you lost him?

861
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:56,901
I'm stiII working on it.

862
01:13:57,079 --> 01:14:00,344
WeII, untiI you do, stay cIear
of the rendezvous. AII right?

863
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:03,350
No. We're going to
the underpass now.

864
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:06,511
-You heard what he said.
-I'm picking up my brother.

865
01:14:06,688 --> 01:14:09,213
Are you out of your mind?
I've worked too hard.

866
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:13,293
Either you're coming with,
or I drive myseIf. You choose.

867
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,790

868
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:22,394
Oh, shit!

869
01:14:28,944 --> 01:14:31,606
Shit! Get him off my ass.

870
01:15:07,816 --> 01:15:09,408
Look out!

871
01:15:11,653 --> 01:15:13,143
Happy?

872
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:15,183
Just drive.

873
01:15:28,637 --> 01:15:30,298
Where's my brother?

874
01:15:30,472 --> 01:15:31,871
Surprised to see me aIive?

875
01:15:32,174 --> 01:15:33,937
-Where's Veronica?
-Veronica said--

876
01:15:34,109 --> 01:15:36,134
I don't care. You both tried to kiII--

877
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,241
-Where's my brother?
-What brother?

878
01:15:46,021 --> 01:15:47,545
Where's my brother?

879
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:50,055
Looks Iike we've both been set up.

880
01:15:58,734 --> 01:16:00,065
Anna. Anna.

881
01:16:00,869 --> 01:16:02,166
Come on, Iet's go!

882
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:04,599
Where is he?

883
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:06,597
Where is he?

884
01:16:16,251 --> 01:16:18,048
Back off.

885
01:16:22,324 --> 01:16:24,554
Let's go, Iet's go! Come on!

886
01:16:24,726 --> 01:16:28,526
I won't ask you again.

887
01:16:29,531 --> 01:16:30,759

Give me my brother!

890
01:16:53,588 --> 01:16:54,612
He's dead.

891
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:42,829
Goddamn you!

892
01:17:43,004 --> 01:17:44,665
You used me.

893
01:17:45,373 --> 01:17:47,466
I trusted you, you son of a bitch.

894
01:17:49,978 --> 01:17:51,605
Who's got POTUS?

895
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:54,072
You're too Iate, Tom.

896
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:55,978
Why the fuck did you do this?

897
01:17:56,151 --> 01:17:57,675
You can't stop us.

898
01:17:58,086 --> 01:17:59,314
You'II never stop it.

899
01:18:00,255 --> 01:18:04,419
This war wiII never end.

900
01:18:06,762 --> 01:18:08,320
Kent.

901
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:12,331
Kent. Kent, what have you done?

902
01:18:13,702 --> 01:18:16,637
Kent, who's got the president?

903
01:18:16,872 --> 01:18:18,430
Kent!

904
01:18:30,986 --> 01:18:32,044
Stop him.

905
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,484
Get him under controI. Stop him!

906
01:18:42,898 --> 01:18:43,956
Anna!

907
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:45,491
Anna!

908
01:18:48,303 --> 01:18:49,395
Anna!

909
01:18:49,704 --> 01:18:52,002
No! Don't kiII him!

910
01:18:53,441 --> 01:18:54,465
Look out!

911
01:18:59,247 --> 01:19:00,839
Anna!

912
01:19:01,216 --> 01:19:03,013
Anna!

913
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:39,880
Jesus Christ.

914
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:48,491
-Anna! Anna!
-Oh, my God.

915
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:51,863
Are you aII right?

916
01:20:20,829 --> 01:20:23,320
Oh, my God. Mr. President?

917
01:20:24,165 --> 01:20:26,759
Barnes? Is that you?

918
01:20:46,421 --> 01:20:47,820
Mr. President.

919
01:20:51,092 --> 01:20:52,184
I've got you.

920
01:20:54,596 --> 01:20:57,258
-Can you sit up?
-Yeah.

921
01:21:07,976 --> 01:21:09,034
Are you injured?

922
01:21:10,045 --> 01:21:11,376
Yeah.

923
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:14,047
It's not important.

924
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:27,051
This is Agent Thomas Barnes.

925
01:21:28,096 --> 01:21:29,723
POTUS is in hand.

926
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:32,998
I repeat, POTUS is in hand.

927
01:21:33,168 --> 01:21:37,468
We need a pickup
seven bIocks east of the pIaza.

928
01:21:41,309 --> 01:21:42,867
Thank you.

929
01:21:43,044 --> 01:21:45,774
-Thank you.
-No probIem.

930
01:21:47,248 --> 01:21:50,342
Bye, Anna, bye.

931
01:22:01,162 --> 01:22:02,652
-HeIIo?
-Oh, thank God.

932
01:22:02,831 --> 01:22:05,629
-Howard, are you okay? Are you hurt?
-No, I'm--

933
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,995
-Are you sure? Are you okay?
-I'm aII right.

934
01:22:08,169 --> 01:22:11,536
We were watching the news.
We got your message. You're all right?

935
01:22:11,706 --> 01:22:13,367
-Yeah.
-Because we were so worried.

936
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:15,008
-I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

937
01:22:15,176 --> 01:22:18,634
The kids have been really concerned
about you. Nate wants to talk to you.

938
01:22:18,813 --> 01:22:19,973
I'm so glad you're okay.

939
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:23,584
-AII right, put him on the phone for me.
-Okay, all right, hold on.

940
01:22:23,752 --> 01:22:25,481
Here's your daddy, Nate.
He's okay.

941
01:22:25,653 --> 01:22:27,450
Nate. That you?

942
01:22:27,622 --> 01:22:29,283
Hi, Dad.

943
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:31,286
How you doing, buddy?

944
01:22:31,459 --> 01:22:33,893
I'm okay. I'm fine.

945
01:22:34,062 --> 01:22:35,586
Don't you worry about anything.

946
01:22:35,764 --> 01:22:37,459
-Will you be coming back?
-Yeah.

947
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:42,360
TeII your mom that I'm coming home
right now. I Iove you guys.

948
01:22:43,738 --> 01:22:46,206
Back off, sir. Back off.

949
01:22:49,244 --> 01:22:50,905
Thank you, Thomas.

950
01:22:54,616 --> 01:22:56,447
You're weIcome, sir.

951
01:23:18,506 --> 01:23:20,337
Reports out of Salamanca
now suggest...

952
01:23:20,508 --> 01:23:22,738
...that the president
is out of intensive care.

953
01:23:22,911 --> 01:23:24,708
His condition is listed as stable.

954
01:23:24,879 --> 01:23:26,813
President Ashton
has made a point...

955
01:23:26,981 --> 01:23:29,449
...of reassuring Americans
that he's all right...

956
01:23:29,617 --> 01:23:32,450
...and the summit will continue
in the days to come.

957
01:23:32,987 --> 01:23:35,956
MeanwhiIe, word from Spanish
and United States authorities...

958
01:23:36,124 --> 01:23:40,117
...is that they've shot and kiIIed the Ione
assassin responsibIe for today's attack.

959
01:23:40,295 --> 01:23:42,388
Our own Joan Kendrick has more.
