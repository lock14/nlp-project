for an explanation about--

Wendy, just--just
listen to me, all right?

515
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,254

I went online

looking for
an explanation

517
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,190
about what happened,
and I found out

518
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:29,475
about this high
school French class

519
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:30,542
from New York.

520
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:33,579
6 years ago they went
on a trip to Paris.

521
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:36,047
When they were boarding,
a kid had a vision

522
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:37,382
that the plane
was gonna explode.

523
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:40,703
Just like you did.

524
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,087
He freaked out

525
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:44,422
and 7 people
got off the plane.

526
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:48,226
Just like us.

527
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,148
And on takeoff,
flight 180 blew up.

528
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,535
And over the next
several months,

529
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,203
everyone who got off
that plane

530
00:25:58,205 --> 00:26:00,672
started dying
in weird accidents.

531
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:02,491
They died in the order
they would've

532
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,259
if they had stayed
on the plane.

533
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:07,663
Unless someone intervened,
then it skipped them.

534
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:10,282

happened to us as simple?

had that premonition

1219

and none of us
had gotten off that ride,

1220

make sense to you?

1222
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,979
IAN: Oh, yeah.

1223
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:48,917

dies of a plain heart attack

1224
01:01:48,919 --> 01:01:50,584

1245
01:03:53,392 --> 01:03:55,392
Let's go with what
you guys are saying.

1246
01:03:55,394 --> 01:03:56,727
Let's just say,
you know,

1247
01:03:56,729 --> 01:03:59,197
that death does have
a conscious plan

1248
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:01,565
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

1249
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:03,767
So, Newton's third
law of motion,

1250
01:04:03,769 --> 01:04:05,002
and, well, look,

1251
01:04:05,004 --> 01:04:06,570
I'm just guessing that
it goes for death, too,

1252
01:04:06,572 --> 01:04:08,505
when he's working
in our world.

1253
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:10,774
Newton says
that every action

1254
01:04:10,776 --> 01:04:12,476
has an equal and
opposite reaction.

1255
01:04:12,478 --> 01:04:15,563
So, that means that

1256
01:04:15,565 --> 01:04:19,500
if death has taken
action so can we.

1257
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:21,736
And that that action
we take might have

1258
01:04:21,738 --> 01:04:24,338
an opposite reaction that
thwarts death's intent.

1259
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,107
You're being a fucker,
but go on.

1260
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:29,010
Ok. Ok.

1261
01:04:29,012 --> 01:04:32,280
What if,
for example,

1262
01:04:32,282 --> 01:04:34,715

1263
01:04:34,717 --> 01:04:37,018

the utilitarian choice...

1264
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,520
Kill themselves.

1265
01:04:41,674 --> 01:04:44,242
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much
gonna ruin any plan

1266
01:04:44,244 --> 01:04:47,045
that death's put in motion.
And even better,

1267
01:04:47,047 --> 01:04:50,764

I didn't do anything.

1286
01:06:22,005 --> 01:06:23,838
I told them about
the pictures in the camera

1287
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,039
and flight 180
and Frankie and Lewis

1288
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:27,441
and why we went to see
Ian and Erin and--

1289
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:28,910
did they
believe you?

1290
01:06:28,912 --> 01:06:30,962
Yeah, right.
Would you believe me?

1291
01:06:30,964 --> 01:06:33,498
No, they looked at me
like I was crazy.

1292
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,967

had us in there.

1293
01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:37,168
For all we know,

1294
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,270
whoever was sitting behind
Erin is already dead.

1295
01:06:39,272 --> 01:06:40,872
And we're next.

1296
01:06:40,874 --> 01:06:42,340
Now.

1297
01:06:45,243 --> 01:06:49,380
Ian almost died first,
but we intervened.

1298
01:06:49,382 --> 01:06:50,915
So it skipped Ian.
That's...

1299
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:52,784
That's how
we regain control.

1301
01:06:53,987 --> 01:06:56,020

to be next is skipped.

wait, wait, wait.

1303
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:59,724

on the roller coaster...

1304
01:07:01,259 --> 01:07:03,227
Well, I'm next...

1305
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:04,462
And then you.

1306
01:07:04,464 --> 01:07:07,665
