That one.

00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:03,676
Here boy.

4
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:09,316
You're heavy.

5
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,900
And slobbery.

6
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,860
There.

7
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,300
You're a good boy!

8
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,740
You're my good boy!

Hello!

11
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,180
Honey, I don't have much time!

12
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,620
<i>Daddy?</i>

13
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,500
<i>Are you okay?</i>

14
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,100
Something's came up at work, honey.

15
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,060
Daddy is not gonna be home
for a while.

16
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,140
I don't understand.

17
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,420
<i>You can't go back
to the house Penny, okay?</i>

18
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,700
<i>What's happening?</i>

19
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,300
<i>It's alright.
You won't be alone.</i>

20
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,220
<i>You have Bolt.</i>

21
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,660
I've altered him.

22
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,220
He can protect you now.

26
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,780
There he is, doctor Calico!

27
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,140
Any luck getting our guest
to spill his guts?

28
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,900
<i>Oh, his guts will spill.</i>

29
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,660

As the package arrived...</i>

34
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,900
<i>...I think it might make our dear friend
a bit more communicative.</i>

35
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:27,940
I'm sending an agent to pick it up.

36
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,140
<i>Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me
on the first flight.</i>

37
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,100
Bolt, let's go!

38
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,100
<i>We only need the girl!</i>

39
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,260
- What?
- Where is Calico?

40
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,140
I'm not talking to you.

41
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,820
Bolivia, Bolivia,
Calico is in Bolivia!

42
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,260
Near lake Rogaguado!

43
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,700
Lake Rogaguado?
I should have known!

44
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,100
Come on Bolt, let's go.

45
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,700
Bolivia!

46
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,980
There is a flight
leaving in 10 minutes.

47
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,300
Bolt, zoom zoom!

48
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,940
Bolt, dispatch!

49
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,380
Puppy!

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,420
LOCK

51
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,740
Good boy!

52
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,220
Airport!

53
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,180
Bolt, speak.

54
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,260
Okay, okay...

55
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,900
Good job, buddy.

56
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,580
Mission accomplished!

57
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,300
That's a keeper!

58
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,140
It's alright tough guy,
you caught them all.

59
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,900
Don't worry Bolt,
you've saved the day again.

60
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,620
<i>Good boy!</i>

61
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,180
<i>Airport!</i>

62
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,500
<i>Bolt, speak.</i>

63
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Boom mike!

64
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,020
- We got a boom mike.
- That's a boom mike.

65
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,740
That's sloppy.

66
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,620
The dog could've seen that.
He could've seen that!

67
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,980
Uh, who cares if the dog
sees a boom mike?

68
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,580
Forgive me for answering
a question with a question,...

69
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,820
...but who are you?

70
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,300
Mindy Parker, from the network.

71
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,020
Of course. Let me ask you,
Mindy from the network...

72
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,500
What do you see here?

73
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,380
- Uhh... the dog?
- "The dog" she says.

74
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,020
Oh, Mindy. Poor, poor Mindy.

75
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,700
Am I missing something?

76
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,300
You're missing everything, Mindy.

77
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,300
You see a dog.
I see an animal that believes...

78
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:01,380
...with every fiber of his being,
every fiber...

79
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,340
...that the girl he loves
is in mortal danger.

80
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:07,100
I see a depth of emotion on the face
of that canine the likes of which...

81
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,460
...has never been captured
on screen before.

82
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,820
Never, Mindy from the network.

83
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,900
We jump through hoops to make sure
Bolt believes everything is real.

84
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,380
It's why we don't miss marks.
It's why we don't reshoot.

85
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,300
And it's why we most certainly
do not let the dog see boom mikes!

86
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,540
Because, Mindy from the network,...

87
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,420
...if the dog believes it,...

88
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,660
...the audience believes it.

89
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,780
Wow. Okay, you want reality,
here you go chief.

90
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,420
The show's too predictable.

91
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,540
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her
from the creepy english guy, we get it.

92
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,100
There's always a happy ending.

93
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:56,100
And our focus groups tell us
18 to 35 year olds are unhappy.

94
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,140
They're not happy with happy.

95
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,860
So maybe you should,
I don't know,...

96
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,540
...spend a little less time worrying about
the dog's method acting,...

97
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,060
...and more time figuring out
how to stop 20 year olds in Topeka...

98
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:06,300
...from changing the channel.

99
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,900
Because if you lose
so much as half a rating point,...

100
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,300
...so help me, I will fire everyone
in this room, starting with you!

101
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,340
How's that for real?

102
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,660
There. Perfect.

103
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,380
You saved me again, Bolt.

104
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,020
It's okay, it's nothing.

105
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,940
No more bad guys.

106
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,540
Do you want some food, Bolty?
Huh? Are you hungry?

107
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,340
You've got them, Bolt,
no one is gonna hurt me.

108
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,500
Bolt, look at me.
I'm fine, see?

109
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,020
Come here buddy, come here!

110
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,940
Go, get it Bolt!
Go, get it!

111
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,940
Yeah, that one is no funny either.

112
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,900
Well, what we have here?

113
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Your old buddy, Mister Carrot!

114
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,660
Oh, Bolt!

115
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,260
You know I have to go.

116
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,940
Yeah, you are my good boy.

117
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,340
And there she is,
my little superstar!

118
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
Let's get to that
"Teen" vogue cover shoot.

119
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,740
Mam, I wanna take Bolt
home for this weekend.

120
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:03,180
- Well, I... I'm...
- Oh, that be nice. That be great.

121
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,900
That would.
A little girl and her dog.

122
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,060
Nothing better that.

123
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,100
So I can bring Bolt home?

124
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,820
As your friend,
I say yes, absolutely...

125
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,260
...but as your agent, I have to remind you.
This is Bolt's world.

126
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,940
He has to stay right here.
Okay, let's go.

127
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,860
But he never gets to be a real dog.

128
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,580
And it will be only for the weekend
and I just once...

129
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,020
What? You know what? It's a fair question.
Let's do this, let's put a pin in it.

130
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,980
Pin in, there you go. Now,
let's let that hang there a little bit...

131
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,580
...and then we'll address that
when we thought things through, okay?

132
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,420
Good enough for everybody?
Smiles all around!

133
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:42,620
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

134
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:46,060
I don't need to think it through.
I wanna take Bolt home.

135
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,100
Look at this face!
I have a little girl at home,...

136
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:53,100
...love of my life.
I would do anything for her.

137
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,660
And I would trade her for you
in a heartbeat!

138
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
True story.

139
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,140
That reminds me, uh,
we need to begin over to wardrobe.

140
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,260
Let's go.

141
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,740
- I need every...
- I... I just...

142
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,780
So, the dog thinks this is all real?

143
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:20,220
Oh, yeah. Hear new.
Guy never leaves the set.

144
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,380
It's unbelievable. Whenever I get a chance
this is the perfect way to unwind.

145
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,420
I like to start with an evil laugh.

146
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,220
Hello, hairballs!

147
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,660
You may have one today Bolt,
but in the end...

148
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,660
...we will get your little Penny.

149
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,100
Not likely cat. For you've choosen
to follow the path of evil,...

150
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,060
...ultimately we'll destroy you,
along with your fiendish puppet master.

151
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,940
- Wow!
- I know. Okay, watch this.

152
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,380
She is a goner, dog.
But green-eyed man has a plan...

153
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:00,740
...and soon he will execute it.

154
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,660
Yeah and then he will execute her!

155
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,380
Nice!

156
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:11,540
I would super bark you both
back into the hole you crawled out of...

157
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,060
...but I need you alive...

158
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,380
...because I got a little message for you
to take back to your green-eyed man.

159
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,820
You tell him,
his old friend Bolt said he...

160
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,020
Is it long?

161
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,220
- Is what long?
- The message.

162
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:26,420
Is it a long message?
Because I have a horrible memory.

163
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,860
Yeah, I'll make a brief, all right?
You tell him I said, I'm gonna...

164
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,500
You know what?
Why don't we do this?

165
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,740
You remember the first half of the message
and then I remember the second.

166
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,060
And then we can pass it on
green-eyed man together.

167
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:39,540
I don't care how the message
is translated, alright?

168
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,460
Just do it, okay? Tell the green-eyed man,
that I will not sleep,...

169
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:46,820
...I will not rest until my Penny is safe
from his evil clutches.

170
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,660
You tell the green-eyed man, I'll...

171
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,140
Way too many words! I was like, "what?",
and then I was like "huh?"...

172
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,500
...and then "I got a little bored".
Some about clutches?

173
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,460
Anyway, I'll do my best!
Ciao!

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,020
By the way, huge fan, love it,
love you, gotta go. Thank you!

175
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,220
Get back here, you... You sick!
Revolting, low some little...

176
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,900
Dogs!

177
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,300
Cats!

178
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,580
I'll never let them get you, Penny!

179
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,220
You ready, Bolt?

180
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,020
Let's widen out camera three.

181
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,420
Ready four! Go four!

182
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,100
And... driver.

183
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,380
Thanks, Larry.

184
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,100
<i>Alright Scooter, right the grade.
Ready on to propel bars.</i>

185
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,260
<i>And track with them!</i>

186
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,820
Calico's super computer.

187
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,500
If we can access it...

188
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,180
...we'll find and learn
where they're keeping my father.

189
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,780
The weapon is hot.

190
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,340
"Heat vision" time.

191
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,580
Bolt, stare!

192
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,140
Now!

193
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,620
Nice move.

194
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,620
Come on, come on!

195
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,940
Such devotion...
It brings tears to my eyes!

196
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,180
Calico!

197
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:25,540
Your father's discoveries could be
a great use to our organization.

198
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,780
I'm sure, he will be
more commutating...

199
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,220
...now that I've got
his "lucky Penny"!

200
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,540
Bolt!

201
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,380
World domination is waiting my grasp!

202
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,060
How did your focus groups
feel about the end of this?

203
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,300
You asked for unhappy
18 to 35 years olds,...

204
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,780
...I give you unhappy
18 to 35 year olds.

205
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,220
<i>Bolt, it's okay Bolt.
I'm fine.</i>

206
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,340
<i>Guards, stop her!</i>

207
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,620
- Hey, hey!
- Bolt!

208
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,900
- Hold on!
- Listen to him.

209
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,660
- He needs to know I'm okay.
- No, you're not okay.

210
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,660
You've been kidnapped by
fiendish Doctor Calico.

211
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:19,940
At least that is what the dog
needs to think but...

212
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:23,220
...just imagine, close your eyes
and imagine how excited he'll be...

213
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,020
...when he saves you, tomorrow. OK?

214
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,140
But he's gonna be freaking out all night.
Please, just let me...

215
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,460
Wait a second.
What's that behind your ear?

216
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:36,100
Is that a... Yes, it is!
It's a pin!

217
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,100
Let's do this. Let's take the pin
and put it in this conversation.

218
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,060
And we will not take it down, no m'am,
until this matter is resolved.

219
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,020
- But I just...
- What's that reminds me up?

220
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,460
The DVD release junket.
Let's get going. It's a big push.

221
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:51,300
I want to go with a modern looks.

222
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,700
Alright, okay. Let's give her some air.
Let's not crowd the talent.

223
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,420
I've been working on my evil laugh.
Is there an evil laugh like...

224
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Like that?

225
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,140
Okay, here is the thing.
You're not ready for the evil laugh.

226
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,700
You could do a chuckle,
like a mildly upset chuckle...

227
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,100
...after my evil laugh.
Listen to mine.

228
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,620
Hey Bolt!

229
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
Climbing here!

230
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,460
Bolt, come back!

231
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,260
I'm too late.

232
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:35,500
- Bolt, help!
- I'm coming Penny!

233
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,660
<i>Bolt, help!</i>

234
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,020
Hold on, Penny.
Hold on!

235
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,300
<i>Bolt, help!</i>

236
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,100
<i>Bolt, help!</i>

237
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,340
Penny!

238
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,580
Bolt! Here, Bolt!

239
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,620
Okay, Bolty, okay!
Stay cool! You're cool, Bolty!

240
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,460
The green-eyed man!

241
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,380
Penny! Penny!

242
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,780
Penny!

243
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,940
Target acquired!

244
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,620
It ends here!

245
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,980
Penny!

246
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,620
Penny!
They moved her.

247
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,820
There is no time
for formalities, brothers.

248
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,740
My person is in danger
and I... I...

249
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,820
- Wow! What're you doing?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

250
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,180
- You wanna sniff mine first?
- What?

251
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,580
- Not from around here, are you?
- Hey, stop it!

252
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,300
- What?
- This is serious.

253
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,740
Hey, there. Are you lost sweety?

254
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,340
Hey, wait!

255
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,820
Why can't I bend these stupid bars?

256
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Oh, buddy!

257
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,660
You got your head stucked
pretty good, huh guy?

258
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,100
Hey guys, come here. Check this out!
He's got his melon stucked.

259
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,940
Yup, that is one stucked melon.

260
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,100
Hey, hey buddy, take it easy!
Slow down.

261
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:43,540
I will not take it easy,
because I'm missing my person.

262
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,980
Hey buddy, relax. Like this,
turn and pull. Turn and pull.

263
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,380
Forget about it,
you'll be out no time.

264
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,820
What are these things?
They're weaken me.

265
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,300
- Polystyrofoam packing peanuts.
- Styrofoam?

266
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,060
This has a "green-eyed man"
written all of it!

267
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,940
Have you seen the man
with a green eye?

268
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,940
You know, I gotta say something,
if I could say something here.

269
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,300
You look familiar.
Joey, look at this guy's mug.

270
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,140
Yeah, you know, I could've sworn
I've seen this guy before.

271
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:34,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

272
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,780
I gotta tell ya,
I never forget a face.

273
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,300
- He never does.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

274
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:40,580
- Never. - Yeah, he's really good
with the faces and such.

275
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,540
Listen, listen! The man with the green eye.
Tell me what you know, birds!

276
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,100
- I know this dog.
- Yeah, yeah, me too!

277
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,660
I gotta remember,
it's gonna kill me. Hold on.

278
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,820
No, I don't know.
I, I, I thought I know.

279
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,780
Hey, you ever hang out down on 14th Street
with a stray named Kelvin?

280
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,940
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kelvin, the Labrador.
- What?

281
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,180
You gotta gimme something here,
cause this is redonkulous.

282
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,020
Absolutely redonkulous!

283
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,060
Capisch redonkulous!
Ya know what that means?

284
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,220
You pigeons are useless.

285
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,340
I need someone on the inside,
someone close to the green-eyed man.

286
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,380
- A cat.
- Oh, a cat?

287
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,580
Yeah, a cat. When I find him...

288
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,380
When I find him, I'm gonna
make that cat wish never born.

289
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,500
I think we know just the cat.

290
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,580
Right on time, Saul.
Come on in.

291
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,380
Okay, Saul, nice work. Let's find
some mustard next time. Okay, babe?

292
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,460
Yes, Mittens.
Thank you, Mittens.

293
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,980
Is that an everything bagel, Ted?

294
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,740
- Attaboy!
- Good day, Mittens.

295
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,260
Louie!

296
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,860
What is this?

297
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:11,060
It was a slow week.
I mean, that's half of what I got.

298
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,700
You hear this, Louie?
I'm starving here.

299
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,500
And when the old stomach
starts talking, it ain't talking to me.

300
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,500
- It's talking to... the claws!
- Not the claws! Please!

301
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,700
I'm holding these bad boys back as best as
I can, but the thing is it's not up to me.

302
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,420
The stomach got a direct line
to these babies,...

303
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,900
...and I'm picking up a lot of chatter!

304
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,540
So, I'll talk to the claws,
but in exchange...

305
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:44,460
...next week, all your food comes to me.
- But that's not our deal!

306
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,100
I bring you half, you give me
protection! That's our deal.

307
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,660
Yeah, well, the deal just expired.
Now, get lost.

308
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,020
Mark my words, Mittens.

309
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,700
One day, someone's gonna stand up to you!
Someone's gonna teach you a lesson!

310
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,780
Yeah, I'm really scared now.

311
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,900
You should be!

312
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,780
Aaah! Okay! You...

313
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,820
Where is she?

314
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,740
- Who?
- You know why I'm here!

315
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,260
Where is she?

316
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,860
Okay, okay! Look buddy, I don't know
what you're getting at, but...

317
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,580
Come on, Mittens.
Just tell the guy where she is.

318
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,660
- Tell the dog, make him happy.
- Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens! Tell him!

319
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,060
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

320
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,980
Would you tell the crazy canine
that he's got the wrong cat?

321
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,940
- You got her, pal!
- That's her!

322
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:40,340
- She's the one!
- That is definitely the right cat!

323
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,900
Looks like we're gonna do this
the hard way.

324
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,420
Whoa! Aaah!
Are you crazy, man?

325
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,620
Hey Joey, do we go to far on this?

326
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,420
You kidding?
This is the best day in my life.

327
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,620
You work for Ben and Bart,
who work with the man green-eye.

328
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:02,060
They take him Penny.
Where is she?

329
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:05,020
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- This is becoming tiresome cat...

330
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:07,780
...in fact, I feel a yawn coming on.

331
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,820
Okay, okay, I'll talk, I'll talk.
I know where Penny is.

332
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,420
Yeah, they have her.

333
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:18,060
Yes, the men in black and the guy,
the guy with the blue eyes.

334
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:19,140
Blue eyes?

335
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,820
Oh, green! Yes, green!
The one green eye.

336
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,860
You just can't stop lying, can you cat?
It's in the genes. This is gross.

337
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,020
I know, it's disgusting,
I disgust myself.

338
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,940
Hollywood?

339
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,260
But if you put me down,
I'll show you where she is.

340
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,820
You know, I hope you appreciate
the risk I'm taking here.

341
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,780
Every bone in my evil
cat body is telling me...

342
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,500
...not to betray the trust
of the green-eyed man.

343
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,660
Okay, this is a top,
top secret map...

344
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,300
...of the entire earth!

345
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,380
Now, we're over here,
by the green lady with the big torch.

346
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,260
And my boss has Penny locked up...

347
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,500
Right, right over... Here, here!
By the waffle with the sun glasses!

348
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,580
Now all you need to do
is get from here to there.

349
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:30,860
Well, I told you where you find her, so
if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.

350
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,500
I'll release you cat,
when we found Penny.

351
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,300
Excuse me? That wasn't the deal!
We had a deal!

352
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Your deal just expired.

353
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,740
She said that to me,
not 10 minutes ago.

354
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,780
The irony!

355
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Perfect.

356
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,020
Hmm... padlock.

357
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,460
Listen Cujo, I got some pretty
wicked claws under these mitts,...

358
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:09,500
...do not, I beg of you do not make me
bring out these bad boys!

359
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,340
It gets ugly!

360
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,260
- What are you doing?
- Stay back!

361
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,260
If I stare at the lock really hard,
it'll burst into flames and melt.

362
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,180
Now I'm concerned on a number of levels.

363
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,540
- Easy, watch! Watch it those!
- I'm good. We gotta go.

364
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,500
Intruders!

365
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,580
Hey! Slow down you screwy
borrowed of mind...

366
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,460
- Oh, boy, this thing is heavy.
- Hey, hey! Put it down.

367
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,220
I forgot the keys.

368
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,220
I'll be right back.

369
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,020
Hey, lucky Penny.

370
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Thanks. Now move your butt.

371
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,220
Okay, just upon your left.
Yeah. I got... No, I got, I got mine.

372
00:33:58,221 --> 00:33:59,220
You got it?

373
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,460
It's on tipping my tongue.
I know that dog.

374
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,700
I'm telling you, Joey. Bobby, you guys looking
at me like, you don't know. I'm telling you...

375
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,460
...I know this dog.
I've seen him somewhere.

376
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,100
You remember it tonight,
when you're perching.

377
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,980
Alright, that's...
That's will happen.

378
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,100
- I've got some good news!
- Really?

379
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:53,820
Yes, I do. I just booked you,
on the tonight show's "main guest"!

380
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,700
That's right. That, I mean...

381
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:01,220
...which means just absolutely nothing,
if Bolt is still missing.

382
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:05,260
It's not even a good news, like whatever,
so up tonight show. Who cares? I don't care.

383
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,940
It's okay, baby.

384
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,660
- He must be so scared.
- Scared? This is Bolt we're talking about.

385
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,980
He's not scared of anything.

386
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,340
I bet Bolt would want
you to the tonight show.

387
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,620
It is...

388
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,620
I just... or maybe not.

389
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,140
Bolt loves you very much sweety.
And you're here.

390
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,300
He couldn't have gone far.

391
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,900
Welcome to Ohio.
So much to Discover!

392
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:46,940
So, if you got super powers,
I guess that would make you, what...

393
00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:50,100
...like some kind a super dog?
- That information is classified.

394
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,900
Oh, come on!
Like, what's your best power?

395
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,780
You go to move.
How about flying? Can you fly?

396
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,620
Don't be silly, I can't fly.

397
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:01,860
Okay, okay, fine.
If you don't have any powers,...

398
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:03,820
...you don't have any powers.
What's it to me?

399
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,580
- I have super bark.
- A super bark? Wow, you're kidding me?

400
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,500
What exactly this one do
with the super bark?

401
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,020
I really can't talk about it.
It's classified.

402
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,820
I suggest you pipe down
and take me to Penny.

403
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,820
You're awfully attached
to this Penny character, huh wags?

404
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,540
- She is my person.
- Oh, please. She's a person.

405
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:34,340
And if you ask me,
the only good person is a...

406
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,500
Styrofoam!

407
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,100
Tag and roll!

408
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,980
Tag and what?

409
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,860
What? What is this red liquid
coming from my paw?

410
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,140
It's called blood, hero!

411
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,220
- Do I need it?
- Yes.

412
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,380
So if you want it to keep inside
your body where it belongs,...

413
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:16,220
...you should stop jumping off trucks
doing eighty on the interstate!

414
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,340
Yeah, well, normally I'm a tad more
indestructible. Must have been the...

415
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,020
Styrofoam!
That stuff, it weakens me!

416
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,180
- What are you doing? Put that down!
- Alright, that's it. I've had with you.

417
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,220
Untie me, pooch or I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
Uhmm... I'm gonna seriously wound you!

418
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,780
I'm gonna seriously wound you
with this styrofoam!

419
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,380
Are you mad? You don't know
the power of styrofoam!

420
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,740
Oh, you bet on that, baby.
And I'm about to unleash it!

421
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,020
- The power of the styrofoam!
- No!

422
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,500
Alright, cat. Okay, you win.
I'll untie you.

423
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,900
That's a weird push
to put a piano!

424
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,500
- Are we gonna have any more problems, cat?
- No, no, no. No more problems.

425
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,220
I'll take you to Penny.

426
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,460
Ah! What is that?

427
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,540
- What?
- That!

428
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,900
Okay, you have two seconds to tell me
what you've implanted in me, cat!

429
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,380
Poison? A parasite? Poison?
Wait, I just said that, didn't I?

430
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
See, I'm all discombobulated!
I can't think straight!

431
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,420
Oh, I don't believe this.
You're hungry!

432
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,500
- Where is the antidote?
- Okay, okay! Alright!

433
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,180
There's your antidote...

434
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,260
Food!

435
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:34,540
<i>Alright! Who wants burgers?</i>

436
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,100
<i>- I'll take one.
- Me too!</i>

437
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,620
<i>Watch this!</i>

438
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,700
Go on, use the dog face.
This gonna be beatiful.

439
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,620
You know, beg.
Do the dog face!

440
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,220
What? The dog face?
What is that mean?

441
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,940
Figures, I'm tied to the one dog on earth
who doesn't know how to beg, huh.

442
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,420
Okay, if you want the food...

443
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,300
...the antidote, you're gonna
have to do exactly what I say.

444
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,460
No, not likely. You're a degenerate
creature of darkness.

445
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,140
Yeah, yeah, granted but that's it.

446
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:10,860
All I'm asking you to do is
just tilt your head a little.

447
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,100
You could do that, can't you?
Come on.

448
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,580
- More, more...
- This is stupid.

449
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,220
No, no. Come on. Work with on this.
Please, you're almost there.

450
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,540
Oh, boy!

451
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,100
Okay, try the other way.

452
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,540
There you go! Tilt up! Down.
Now, a little smile. Lose the smile.

453
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,420
Drop your left ear. Your other left.
Okay, the other way was better.

454
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,340
Now, drop them both.
Hold it right there.

455
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,780
And ever so slightly, look up.

456
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,300
Soup is on, baby!

457
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,860
Here you go.

458
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,820
Yes!

459
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,900
Oh, look at you, you little guy!

460
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,220
Here you stupid cat!

461
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,100
<i>...what really happened.
And why is that matter to you?</i>

462
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,940
<i>- Because I'm involved.
- With rich?</i>

463
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:28,500
<i>- With James.
- If you and James are romantic...</i>

464
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,300
<i>...I wanna know all about it.
- What? So you can...</i>

465
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,260
<i>Come undone!</i>

466
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,260
<i>You gonna get stop that leaking!</i>

467
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,700
<i>Go Larry, go Larry, go Larry! Stop!</i>

468
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,580
<i>It really does help and it really
releases the serotonin and...</i>

469
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,140
<i>Hey, man! This time
we'll do it my way!</i>

470
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,540
Well, hello puppy. Did you come for some
of grandma's butter bean dumplings?

471
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,460
You wait right there.

472
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,540
Look at you.
You're quite a little actor, huh?

473
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,900
I haven't eating like this in ages.

474
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,940
Hey, look! My stomach distended.
How great is that!

475
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,860
Yeah, well. Don't get used to it.
We gotta keep moving.

476
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,900
But this place is a gold mine.
What's wrong with you?

477
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,340
Every week, new RVs bring us
new suckers, who bring us new food.

478
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,180
Look around! It's perfect.

479
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,860
Do my eyes deceive me? Is this
some apparition I see before real?

480
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,980
Or could it be?
My hero!

481
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,020
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

482
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,540
You're Bolt, the super dog.
You're fully awesome.

483
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,580
Wait a minute.
You know this dog?

484
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,700
- Oh, I do. He is fully awesome!
- Ah, yeah, yeah. We've established that.

485
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,820
- Who are you?
- I'm Rhino.

486
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,860
Rhino, the hamster?

487
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:08,140
Well, you know, my ancestry
isn't all hamster. I'm 1,16% wolf...

488
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,340
...with a yellow wolverine
and there is some...

489
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,020
But that beside the point!

490
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:17,020
We have before us a legend.
Bolt, the super dog!

491
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:22,180
You can outrun speeding missiles, and burn
through solid metal with his heat vision.

492
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,500
And best of all, he can obliterate
large structures with his super bark!

493
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,220
Wait a minute,
you've seen the super bark?

494
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,340
- Have you been observing me?
- Oh, yeah. I watch you all the time.

495
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,060
- That's incredible.
- Oh, it's nothing, really.

496
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,740
But I'm always so vigilant!
No one can avoid my detection!

497
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,180
- You are a phantom.
- Ah, if you say so...

498
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,780
Oh, hey! Check it out!

499
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,500
Take a gander at this Bolt action.
Scary, huh?

500
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,980
- It's like, we're twins.
- Yeah, scary.

501
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,660
- So, where is Penny?
- She was kidnapped by the green-eyed man.

502
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,940
Kidnapped? This is terrible!
She could be in grave...

503
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,140
Grave danger. I know.
But I've captured this cat.

504
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,900
An agent of the green-eyed man,
I presume!

505
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,980
You presumed correctly.
She is taking me to Penny.

506
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,180
You! You are a vile vermin.

507
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:25,180
How did you sleep at night?
Penny is the most wonderful person ever.

508
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:30,420
She loves Bolt and he is awesome.
And you're a monster!

509
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,860
How dare you disrupt
their relationship with your evil!

510
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,020
- Die! Die!
- Whoa! Whoa!

511
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:38,060
I can take her Bolty.

512
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,540
- Die! Die!
- Easy, easy, Rhino. Easy.

513
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,980
You're right,
we need her alive.

514
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,180
We?

515
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,260
Yes. Bolt, I can be
a valuable addition to your team.

516
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,380
- I'm listening.
- I'm lightning quick.

517
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,260
I have razor sharp reflexes
and I'm a master of stealth.

518
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,580
Plus, I'll keep the cat in check.

519
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,380
- The road will be rough.
- I have a ball.

520
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:09,740
- There is no turning back.
- I guess I have to roll with the punches.

521
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,540
- Easy won't be a part of the equation.
- Promise.

522
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:16,660
Gotta warn you, going into the belly
of the beast, danger in every turn.

523
00:44:16,661 --> 00:44:19,860
- I eat danger for breakfast.
- You're hungry?

524
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,300
- Starving.
- Welcome aboard.

525
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,860
Hey, can we talk for a second?

526
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,340
I don't know what's going on here
but I'm just a little bit concerned...

527
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,660
...about the numbers of lunatics
on this trip.

528
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,820
- My limit is one.
- He is coming with us.

529
00:44:37,821 --> 00:44:38,820
But I...

530
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,380
Move it prisoner,
we're losing daylight.

531
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,500
I agree.

532
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,220
Now, we need to find
a fast set of wheels.

533
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,140
I've got a better idea.
Follow me!

534
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,180
Okay, so what we do here is
we give the target a quick fly over...

535
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,420
...we adjust the trajectory and land
dead center. Am I missing anything, Rhino?

536
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,580
Just the knowledge that every minute
spent in your company becomes...

537
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,100
...the new greatest minute of my life!

538
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:19,380
No, forget it! How do you say,
"No way, I'm doing this" in crazy?

539
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,700
- Calm down, cat. You're with me.
- That's the problem.

540
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,300
Oh, would you be relax?

541
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,740
Every time you get this
on the "magic box", it was awesome!

542
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,620
Magic what?

543
00:45:33,621 --> 00:45:36,220
You know, "magic box",
people stare at.

544
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,980
Wait a minute! Is this "magic box"
have moving pictures on it?

545
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,580
Yeah and Bolt's pictures are the best.

546
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,700
Bolt's pictures?
Of course! He's a former...

547
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,060
Oh, no! Oh, no! No, wait, wait!
Bolt, guys! Hear me out!

548
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,260
- Let it begin! Let it begin! Let it begin!
- Wait, you're not a super he...

549
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,140
What are you doing?

550
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,780
Mittens!

551
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,660
Mittens, take my paw.
I need you alive.

552
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,340
Yeah, of course!
Stay away from me!

553
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,140
- Squeeze my paw, I'll save you!
- No, you won't. You're not really a...

554
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,620
Bolt!

555
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,460
Saboteur!

556
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,780
Ah! Ouch! You moron!

557
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,460
- Stop it! I'm trying to help him.
- Help him? Yeah, right.

558
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,420
Don't worry Bolt!
I'll stop her.

559
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,420
I can't hold it.

560
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,740
- Let it go, you monster!
- Bolt!

561
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:53,460
The real world hurts, doesn't it?
But you wouldn't know about that, would you?

562
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,820
Get down here cat.
We don't have time for this.

563
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,540
I'll get a ladder.

564
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,900
Look, genius.
You're a part of a TV show.

565
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,660
You know what that is, television?
It's an entertainment for people.

566
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,580
It's fake!
Nothing you think is real as real!

567
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,340
That's has preposterous!

568
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,740
Think about it Bolt. Since you got lost,
none of your powers are working, aren't they?

569
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,620
For the first time
you're hungry, you're bleeding.

570
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,660
I mean, do you really think that
you were born with a birthmark...

571
00:48:20,661 --> 00:48:23,780
...in the exact shape of
a lightning bolt?

572
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,540
It's my mark of power, cat!

573
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,700
It's the mark of
a make-up artist, dog!

574
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,780
You're ridiculous!
Now, get down here!

575
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,340
No.

576
00:48:34,341 --> 00:48:37,780
Mittens, so help me, I will
super bark you out of that tree.

577
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,540
Yeah, go nuts. Let's see
how that works out for you.

578
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,020
You leave me no choice.

579
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,620
Oh, the super bark.
Scary, scary!

580
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,300
Yeah, that's really really super.

581
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,460
It's not true. This is not true.

582
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,020
Wow, that one felt really super.

583
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,380
Wait!
No, it didn't.

584
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:15,420
Okay, okay. I get the idea,
you can stop now.

585
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,740
That's enough!
Seriously dog, stop! I'm not kidding.

586
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,940
Would you stop?

587
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,260
Okay, fine. You're the super dog.
Bolt, be quiet, please.

588
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,700
Bolt, we gotta run!

589
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,420
- Bolt!
- Come here.

590
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,820
ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER

591
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,940
LOST DOG - BOLT

592
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,260
He is white with a lightning bolt on his side.
REWARD! Please help me get my friend back.

593
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,220
Look who we found young lady!
It's Bolt!

594
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,460
- They found him!
- Bolt!

595
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,820
Isn't that right you little puppy dog?

596
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,580
That is not Bolt.

597
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,700
Well, that depands on
how you look at it.

598
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,660
You know, when I was little,
I want a bicycle for my birthday...

599
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,700
...but my parents got me
a baseball glove. So...

600
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:37,380
You know what I did? I pretended
that baseball glove was a bicycle.

601
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,060
And I rode it to school every day.

602
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,660
True story.

603
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,420
- It's not him.
- I think it's him. I do.

604
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,020
Thank you.

605
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,660
Look kid, it's time
we are honest with you.

606
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,700
If we don't get back in the production,
people are gonna lose their jobs.

607
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,940
- Good people with families.
- But Bolt is still out there.

608
00:50:57,941 --> 00:50:59,620
- And I...
- I know, we feel for you.

609
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:03,700
And the last thing we wanna do is ask
a little girl to make a grown up decision.

610
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,940
But it's come to that,
we need you to move on.

611
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,060
We need you to let Bolt go.

612
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,300
It must be made of styrofoam!

613
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,900
No, no! No, no, no!
Please, it can't end like this!

614
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:46,340
Stop worrying cat.
I'll get us out of here.

615
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,980
You can't, Bolt. You got nothing.

616
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,500
No super strength,
no super bark.

617
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,420
And no heat vision.

618
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,060
Listen to me, okay?
We've been taking to a place...

619
00:51:57,061 --> 00:51:59,380
...where humans go
animal shopping, alright?

620
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,420
And this is what humans do.
They always pick the cute ones.

621
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:04,380
The ones that look like you, Bolt.

622
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,020
But the rest of us
never come back out.

623
00:52:07,021 --> 00:52:08,940
I said, I'll get us out of here, alright?

624
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,580
My hero!

625
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,740
Ring, ring. Who is it?
Destiny!

626
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,180
I've been expecting your call.

627
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:20,660
Oh, would you give it up already? You're
liquefying, whatever brains you have left.

628
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,300
I can not be contained
in any container.

629
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,060
You quitter! Watch this!

630
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,820
I did it! I'm back!

631
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,900
That styrofoam is a wicked stuff.

632
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:46,500
Totally awesome! There is no truck
that I know that can keep Bolt and Rhino!

633
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,020
Rhino, what are you doing here?

634
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,900
Oh, nothing. I was enjoying an evening
stroll and thought that I'd just...

635
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,700
...pop the hatch on hack
that containment unit!

636
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,620
- You... You opened the door?
- Yes, I did.

637
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,220
That's... That's great, Rhino.

638
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,100
Yeah, that's... That's really good.

639
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:11,180
Alright, let's go get
the prisoner back.

640
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,540
I... I can't do it.

641
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,380
What did you say?

642
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,180
- I can't.
- What... Who are you?

643
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,580
Rhino, you're just...
Just a little...

644
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,860
- You are Bolt.
- But I'm not...

645
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:44,180
Who single handedly destroyed
the green-eyed man's under sea labs?

646
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:44,980
Me, but...

647
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:49,980
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate
the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs?

648
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:52,700
- Who, Bolt, who? Who?
- Me, but none of them...

649
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:57,820
You! You can, Bolt.
Because, all over this planet...

650
00:54:57,821 --> 00:55:00,620
...there are animals
who feel like they can't.

651
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:06,980
Like a little hamster,
who once spent his days in a RV park.

652
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:12,460
Dreaming of the day when he too would save
a little girl from danger and be told:

653
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:17,540
"You did it! You did it, Rhino!
You saved the day. "

654
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,140
They need a hero, Bolt!

655
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:24,140
Someone, who never mind
what the odds, will do what's right.

656
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:28,380
They need a hero to tell them
that sometimes the impossible...

657
00:55:28,381 --> 00:55:33,100
...can become possible,
if you're awesome!

658
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,780
Well, you're right
about one thing, Rhino.

659
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,740
Mittens does need a hero.

660
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,860
I guess I'll have to do.

661
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:48,420
Such modesty! Now,
who is going to save that cat?

662
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,500
- Me.
- Who? Tell me who?

663
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:51,580
Me.

664
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,660
I'll get my ball.

665
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,260
ELMWOOD COUNTY
ANIMAL SHELTER

666
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,460
Over there.

667
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,500
There it is.

668
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:25,580
This will be just like the time, you
infiltrated Calico's R.D. cover base!

669
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,740
It's not gonna be
exactly like that, Rhino.

670
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,380
We're gonna have to do things
a little differently.

671
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,580
Oh, stealth mode!

672
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,220
ADOPT A PET WEEK

673
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,260
- Good night, Ester.
- Good night, Lloyd.

674
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,100
Lloyd?

675
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:57,820
Lloyd Spoon, you jump out and scare me,
and I'm gonna pepper spray ya again!

676
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,660
I swear it, it's like
I work with toddlers!

677
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,820
Threat nullified.

678
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,540
I feel alive!

679
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,060
There's a guard.

680
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,940
I'll snap his neck.

681
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,020
We need to get away him
from that door.

682
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,820
- Ball!
- Ball?

683
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,540
Ball! Ball! Ball! Ball!

684
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:46,780
Oh, come... I'm just... I'm read...
I'm just... Oh, god! Just quiet down!

685
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,620
Mittens?

686
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,860
Bolt!

687
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,700
- What are you doing here?
- I'm busting you out.

688
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:11,100
You came all the way back here, for me?

689
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,060
Yeah.

690
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,380
But how did you... I mean...
You don't have any super powers.

691
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,780
- I know.
- Really?

692
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,380
- Yeah.
- Wow!

693
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:21,940
- Crazy day for you, huh?
- It's been a lot. Yes, it has.

694
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,300
- Are you ready for this?
- No.

695
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,620
Me neither.

696
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,860
Hey, hey, hey!
What is twisting your giblets?

697
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,420
Hey, wait! Where did you get
that hamster?

698
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,380
Give it, give it.

699
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,580
Hey, wait!

700
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,100
Initiating escape!

701
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,420
Lloyd, block the door! Block the door!
Block the door! Block the door!

702
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,460
Super bark! Super bark!

703
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:19,900
Sweet Sister Francis!
What did you do my new truck?

704
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,060
You hold that back later!

705
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,900
Oh, sally Ester!

706
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:29,140
- Both you boys need serious help!
- Spicy eyes!

707
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:35,180
- We need a ride.
- I've got a big one.

708
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,740
You're welcome!

709
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:57,780
I can't believe it! My whole life,
I wanted to see a real live super bark.

710
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:02,580
You are legendary!

711
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,540
Mittens...

712
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:21,340
If... If I don't chase bad guys,
then what am I?

713
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,260
I mean... What...

714
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,700
Don't worry about it.
Being a regular dog,...

715
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:32,420
...is like the greatest gig
in the world, okay?

716
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,700
Look, I'm gonna let you in,
on a little secret, okay?

717
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,300
A little known cat secret.

718
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,580
You know why we hate dogs?

719
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,940
Because we wanna be dogs,
we have dog complexes.

720
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,500
But... But what are dogs do?

721
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,500
Slubber, sleep,
chase tails, chew shoes.

722
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,460
You don't exactly need
a master's degree.

723
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,900
You know, most dogs
living in a place like this.

724
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,820
And uhm... Well, I don't know,
they do things like...

725
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,780
Out of this? But... But...

726
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,660
- And this is your dog bowl.
- What is?

727
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:06,900
This! The entire floor!
It's the ground, goes to the hound.

728
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,340
How cool is that?

729
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:12,940
And on cold nights,
this and a ball of yarn...

730
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,780
Oh, it doesn't get better than that.

731
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:19,540
You... You seem to know
a lot about this places.

732
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:23,580
Yeah, I did my time in one of these, but I'm
more be an alley cat at heart, you know?

733
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,260
Sprung out first chance I got,
never looked back.

734
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,580
<i>Rhino is awesome!
He is so awesome!</i>

735
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:39,460
He is... He is beyond awesome.
He... He is "be awesome"!

736
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,540
He is... Uh!

737
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,260
I... I am "be awesome".

738
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:55,260
I think it's about time I introduce you
to a regular dog piece d'resistance.

739
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,660
- Get your head out.
- Why?

740
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,100
Just do it.

741
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,220
This...
This is awesome.

742
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,500
And stick your tongue out!

743
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,500
This is totally awesome!
Why don't you try it?

744
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,820
No, thanks.
It's really a dog thing.

745
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:33,700
<i># I have got so much to give,</i>

746
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,260

01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,620

<i># cuz that home belongs to you.</i>

781
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,260
Hey Bolt, wake up.

782
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,620
Come on, I've got a surprise for you.

783
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,740
Okay, okay, no picking.

784
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:45,180
Alright. Now, open them.

785
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,940
Bask in the glow, baby!

786
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,940
Just let me give you
the grand tour, okay?

787
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:58,380
This one, this one is mine.
And this one is all yours.

788
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,980
- Mittens, I... - Oh, I found this
really soft pillow thing for you.

789
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:05,340
And get this! I found some
styrofoam and I stuffed it inside...

790
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:08,140
...which I thought both kind of creative
and ironic. You know what I mean?

791
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:10,180
- Mittens, I don't think that...
- Check it out!

792
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:14,660
Total privacy
and completely sound proof!

793
01:06:14,661 --> 01:06:18,060
- Yeah, well, I don't think that I...
- Okay, I lied. It's not sound proof.

794
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,580
- But, you know...
- Mittens, I can't stay here.

795
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:26,580
- What?
- We're one waffle away from Penny.

796
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:30,140
You still going back to her?

797
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,180
Mittens, she is my person.

798
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:37,980
Ouch! Ouch! Ear, ear!

799
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,780
Look at me, Bolt.
I'm real.

800
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,660
Now, how about this, huh?
Is that real?

801
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:51,580
Is this look real to you?
Or that? Is that real? Or that?

802
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:55,660
How about that, Bolt?
She is an actress.

803
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,660
- She is just pretending.
- Not Penny.

804
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:03,460
There is no Penny.
She is fake.

805
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,100
No, you're wrong. She loves me.

806
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:08,580
No, no Bolt.
That's what they do, okay?

807
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,980
They act like they love you.
They act like they'll be there forever.

808
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,820
And then one day, they pack up
all their stuff and move away,...

809
01:07:14,821 --> 01:07:16,980
...and take their love with them.

810
01:07:16,981 --> 01:07:20,660
And leave their declawed cat
behind to fend for herself!

811
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,820
They leave her...

812
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:32,220
...wondering what she did wrong.

813
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,660
I'm sorry Mittens, but...

814
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:43,180
Penny is different.

815
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,580
Then go.

816
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,660
- Mittens, I...
- Get out of here, Bolt!

817
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,340
I never should take a pitty on you.

818
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,420
- Oh, Mittens...
- Just get out of here, Bolt!

819
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,140
You take care of Mittens.

820
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,540
That meat lover's pizza
is not loving me back at all!

821
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:53,060
- Hey there, Rhino.
- Morning, cat.

822
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:58,100
- Where is Bolt?
- He is... Uh...

823
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:02,740
- He's gone.
- Bolt left?

824
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:08,460
Yeah, but he... Uhm... He instructed me
to tell you, that he... Uhm...

825
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:11,500
He had to face
the green-eyed man alone.

826
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,260
- Where are you going?
- To Bolt.

827
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,100
But he doesn't need us anymore.

828
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:24,620
Trust me, I've seen that
a million times before.

829
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:29,140
In the cold, dark night before the battle
when the steely fangs of evil...

830
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,980
...are sharpened and posed to strike...

831
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:34,860
...the hero must go and face
his greatest challenge alone.

832
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:38,060
But if Bolt's taught me anything,...

833
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:41,900
...it's that you never abandon
a friend in a time of need!

834
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:45,260
When your team mates
in trouble, you go.

835
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,860
Whether they ask or not, you go!

836
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:50,340
Not knowing if you're
coming back dead or alive...

837
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,260
He went the other way.

838
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:56,860
...you go! Knowing how deep the shrapnels
gonna pierce your hide, you go!

839
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,220
Penny!

840
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:27,540
No way! Wow! Bolt!
I'm really a big fan of yours, brother.

841
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:30,100
I'm Blake. This is my partner, Tom.
Tom, say what's up.

842
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:31,220
- What's up?
- Wow!

843
01:10:31,221 --> 01:10:32,180
Oh, no!

844
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,060
And this is our
personal assistant, Billy...

845
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,060
...who is supposed
to wait up on the wire.

846
01:10:36,061 --> 01:10:38,660
Bolt, I've been admired you such a long time
and there is something I always wanted...

847
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,460
...to tell you if I ever get
a chance to meet you. And now...

848
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,180
Okay Billy, that was horrifying
what you just did.

849
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:45,140
Why don't you make yourself useful? Go,
get me some bread crumbs. Whole grain. Go!

850
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:47,260
Whole-wheat is not the same thing
as whole grain, Billy!

851
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,940
- Not the same, Billy!
- Do not come out with whole-wheat!

852
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,340
Or pumpernickle Billy!

853
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,900
- Okay guys, but I really gotta get going.
- I know. I know you're a busy dog.

854
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:56,420
But if you got a second, we'd love
to pitch you an idea for your show.

855
01:10:56,421 --> 01:10:58,700
Tom's better pitching.
I'll let him taking from here.

856
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:00,140
Tom has got the spotlight.

857
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,860
Wait for it!

858
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,660
- Aliens.
- Holy snap!

859
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,900
- Aliens?
- Audiences love aliens.

860
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:12,619
Holy crap!

861
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:15,300
- It'll be huge man, huge!
- You can't touch us!

862
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:21,700
I love it. I'll tell you what,
if you guys can help me find Penny,...

863
01:11:21,701 --> 01:11:23,700
...the girl from the television show...

864
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:27,780
...I'd love hear more about
this aliens idea, but on the way.

865
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,180
- We got a nibble!
- Don't freak out.

866
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,940
This is how you blew with Nemo.

867
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:35,020
We open exterior outer space scenery.

868
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,140
Calico comes for your Penny.

869
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,540
And then you squish him.

870
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:53,220
And as the tractor beam is pulling Penny
toward to alien mother ship...

871
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,660
...we fade to black.

872
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,100
And we have a great pop song
for the end credits.

873
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,020
Talk your people.
We're ready to move on this.

874
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,820
He's so on board!

875
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,660
There it is!

876
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,500
The most terrifying place on earth!

877
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:41,100
At long last, we've arrived
at he belly of the beast.

878
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:44,660
The lair of the green-eyed man!

879
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,860
Rhino, hold up!

880
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,740
Hold up!

881
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,300
What, what is the problem?
I'm... I'm pumped!

882
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:57,860
Listen, this may be really hard
for you to understand...

883
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,780
...but you see, sometimes things
aren't what they seem to be...

884
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:04,820
...and sometimes when you think
something is really real and it's not,...

885
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:08,660
All of my training
has prepared me for this moment.

886
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,460
Die! Die!

887
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:18,140
Prepare yourself, foul man-beast!
I will eat your pancreas...

888
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:21,620
...with your spleen and then
I will rip your liver out of your...

889
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:26,540
You're so cute
with your little whiskers.

890
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,420
<i>Oh, I had a hamster just like you
when I was a kid.</i>

891
01:13:58,940 --> 01:13:59,980
<i>Bolt!</i>

892
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,220
Bolt!
You're okay!

893
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,980
Oh, you came back!

894
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,500
Bolt, I thought I've lost you.

895
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,540
You're my good boy.

896
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:58,540
Good boy.

897
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:02,020
Okay, people. Let's move
to stage 7 and do it for real.

898
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,700
- I miss him.
- I know, honey.

899
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:14,300
I do too.

900
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,100
<i>First positions, please!</i>

901
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:31,460
Okay, hold still a little sweetie.

902
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,580
<i>15, take 1. Mark.</i>

903
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,740
<i>And action.</i>

904
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,060
Ah, Professor.

905
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:03,700
I'd like to thank you
for granting us an access...

906
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:07,700
...to that labyrinthian mind of yours.

907
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:10,020
You know I'd never do such a thing.

908
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:16,100
Unless it was only way
to save your little girl's life!

909
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:18,300
- Penny!
- Daddy!

910
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:20,780
Bolt!
Here, Bolt!

911
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:25,100
Your dog is nowhere near...

912
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,340
Get that dog!

913
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,940
Go! Go, go!

914
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:38,980
It's okay, boy. Come here.

915
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:47,540
Fire! Fire! Fire!
It's fire!

916
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,100
Hey Wags!

917
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:59,220
Mittens? What are you doing here?

918
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,900
Long story, short I was tied to a delusional
dog and dragged across the country...

919
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:08,020
...but that is not important now.
The real question is,...

920
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:11,820
...what are you doing here
and why aren't you in there?

921
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,380
You were right about her, Mittens.

922
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:20,820
She, uh, well... it wasn't real.

923
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:23,140
No Bolt, it is real.

924
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:26,220
I was in there just now,
I saw her face after you left.

925
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:28,260
She's broken hearted.

926
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:32,380
She doesn't want just any dog,
she loves you.

927
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:39,180
She's your person, Bolt,
and you are her dog.

928
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,780
- Bolt, you just gonna have to trust
me on this. - Mittens, be quiet!

929
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:49,900
- No, you need to hear this!
- No, no, seriously, be quiet!

930
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,340
What is it?

931
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,380
Penny!

932
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:59,780
- Help! Please, help! Help!
- Hold on!

933
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,540
Please!

934
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,140
Oh, my gosh! The stage!

935
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,420
Yeah, you better run!

936
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,700
- I'm on your six.
- What are we do?

937
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,620
Just make sure
I get inside that building!

938
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:32,820
Bolt?

939
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,500
- Is anyone still in there?
- I don't know.

940
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,340
Coming through!

941
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:50,460
- It's a good day to die!
- Not on my watch, rodent!

942
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:19,540
Bolt!

943
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,660
I knew you'll come back.

944
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,780
Bolt, zoom zoom!

945
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:32,940
Bolt...

946
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,900
Bolt, just... just go on and out.

947
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:41,300
Go.

948
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:44,340
It'll be okay.

949
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,620
You're my good boy.

950
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,500
I love you.

951
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,860
Have you seen my daughter?
Has anyone seen my baby?

952
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:41,580
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

953
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,980
Quiet! Everyone be quiet!

954
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:53,100
It's the super bark!

955
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:56,820
- It's coming from over there!
- Come on, let's go, go!

956
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:13,860
Over here! We found them!
They're here! We found them!

957
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:21,140
Alright, we got a RG coming
through people! Make it hole!

958
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:25,100
<i>For your own safety,
stay away from the building!</i>

959
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,140
- Bolt.
- Sweetie!

960
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:38,060
You're okay! Oh, you gotta be okay.
You're gonna be just fine.

961
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,260
- She is stable.
- We're gonna take her to the hospital...

962
01:22:40,261 --> 01:22:41,460
...just to be safe.

963
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,060
I'm so, so, so sorry does happened.

964
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,980
I can't imagine,
what you must feeling.

965
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:59,500
No mother should ever have to go
through something like this, but I...

966
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:04,180
...promise you, we're
going to make this work for us.

967
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:08,420
I'm talking cover stories, production
deals, executive producer credit...

968
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:10,300
This is so great!

969
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:15,700
We quit!

970
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:19,460
No, no, wait! Let's not make
any rush decisions.

971
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:21,860
Let's put a pin on it.

972
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:36,300
I'm afraid your injuries
far more severe...

973
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,340
...then we've previously
thought, my dear.

974
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:42,300
We have to completely
reconstruct your face.

975
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,780
Have a look.

976
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:53,300
At least Calico won't
be able to recognize me.

977
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,620
Calico!

978
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,500
Bolt!

979
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:21,300
What?

980
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:33,180
Aliens!

981
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:39,940
That is totally unrealistic.

982
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:43,900
- Absolutely "redonkulous".
- You could say that again.

983
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,780
Oh! Oh, yeah! Right there!
Right there! Over!

984
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,020
Yeah, that's the spot.

985
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,380
Hey, silly doggy!

986
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,500
That's a keeper.

987
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:11,300
You wanna go play outside, huh?
You wanna go play outside?

988
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,100
Let's go!

989
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:31,580
- Is that dog look familiar? - Nope. I've
never seen him before in my life.

990
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:43,940
<i># There is no home like the one you've got,</i>

991
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:51,140
<i># cuz that home belongs to you.</i>
