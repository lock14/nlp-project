1
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:43,699
<i>Did you ever meet Don Juan?</i>

2
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:45,824
<i>Never. Not once!</i>

3
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:48,783
<i>Then why are you in mourning?
Because I've never met him.</i>

4
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:54,283
It's amazing. I had no idea
my own funeral could be so delightful.

5
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:57,867
It certainly brought your
career to a happy end. End?

6
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:00,449
<i>Leave off while they still
think of you as you were.</i>

7
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:02,783
<i>All these wrinkles,
these lines, these gray hairs.</i>

8
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:06,408
You'd spoil any party,
even a funeral.

9
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:09,699
No, no, no, my friend.
This is a great sight.

10
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:11,949
Women and women and women.

11
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:14,283
The eternal hunger of women for love.

12
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,408
I pretty much have all my stuff.

13
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,533
Looks like you got a love letter
from one of your other girlfriends.

14
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:39,908
I don't have any other girlfriend,
Sherry. Come on!

15
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:42,783
All right. I get it.

16
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:47,742
No, you don't.
But it's okay.

17
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:51,158
That's the way you are.
You're never going to change.

18
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:54,117
I just don't think
I want to be with an-

19
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:56,908
an over-the-hill Don Juan anymore.

20
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,158
What do you want, Sherry?

21
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:03,117
What do <i>you</i> want, Don?

22
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:06,783
I mean, I'm like your mistress,

23
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,867
except you're not even married.

24
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:12,699
L-Look at your friend Winston
next door.

25
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:15,824
It looks like
they're having a great time.

26
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,742
Don't you ever want to have a family?

27
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:23,367
Well, is that what you want?

28
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:30,158
I don't know what I want, but I just
want to figure it out by myself.

29
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:33,408
By yourself.

30
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,324
Yeah.

31
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:37,992
Maybe I'll call you sometime.

32
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:48,783
<i>Sherry?</i>

33
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:34,533
<i>What are you but a female?
Same as you!</i>

34
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:36,867
<i>Nobody asked you. He never kissed you.</i>
<i>It was an impudent lie!</i>

35
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:39,283
<i>Yes, it was a lie. Don Juan told
me so himself.</i> <i>It was only publicity.</i>

36
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:41,199
<i>He did not!
Don't you-</i>

37
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:43,367
<i>And who are you to give orders here?
Who am I?</i>

38
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,742
Don Juan said I was the girl whose kiss he'd
been seeking on a thousand women's lips!

39
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:49,533
I was the only one. He'd never love
anybody else in his life!

40
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:51,949
<i>Ha! He loved you so much that he went
straight from you to another woman.</i>

41
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:54,367
<i>He loved me!
And loathed young women like you.</i>

42
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:56,074
<i>Cat!
Cow!</i>

43
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,408
Snake!
Pig!

44
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,867
Goat!
Weasel!

45
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:00,574
Worm!
No, no, no, no!

46
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,825
Yeah?

47
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:41,158
Hey, Winston.

48
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,158
You at work?

49
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,991
It's Saturday. Of course. Yeah.

50
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,908
No, I just got up.

51
00:08:58,241 --> 00:09:00,325
What, you can't access the site?

52
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:07,075
Yeah. All right. I'll be right over.

53
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:11,991
Yes. Coffee would be good.

54
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,491
Will it be a cup of Ethiopian coffee?

55
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:20,450
Okay.

56
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:55,366
Good morning.

57
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:57,325
<i>Morning, Don!</i>

58
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:07,658
Hey, you two.
Keep your eyes on the Cheerios.

59
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,075
How's the sweetest grape on the vine?
I'm good.

60
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,408
Winston is in the back,
on his computer,

61
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,408
in his office.

62
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,783
<i>Irie.</i>

63
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:29,700
Thank you, Don.

64
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:38,408
What's up, Winston? Hey, Don. Listen.
I can't seem to access this site.

65
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:41,450
I need your computer expertise.
Yeah? What is it?

66
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:45,158
It's like a whole system for breaking
down the plots of detective fiction...

67
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:47,158
or the solution of crimes.

68
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,408
Y- Click.

69
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,116
Yes. You see?

70
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:54,533
And click. I tried before.

71
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:56,991
Stay calm.
Click. Uh-

72
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,200
Go get 'em, Sherlock.

73
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,158
Cool, cool, cool.

74
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,783
Oh, this is my kind
of information, man.

75
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:09,283
I love the Net.

76
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:13,866
The whole world of information-
through the wall, click.

77
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,075
You sure you don't want a
computer at your house? No.

78
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,075
Seems awful strange to me.

79
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,658
A man who made all of his money off of
computers doesn't want to have one in his house.

80
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,033
Oh!

81
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,616
Cool. Cool.
This is fascinating.

82
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:36,200
Supposedly, you can use this
to write a mystery novel...

83
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:38,450
or to solve a complicated crime.

84
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,866
If-

85
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,033
Don.

86
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:44,991
You all right?

87
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:47,866
What?

88
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,825
Is something wrong?

89
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,408
Well, it's probably nothing.

90
00:11:55,533 --> 00:12:00,283
Uh, a love letter
from one of your lovely ladies.

91
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:02,658
Something like that.

92
00:12:04,783 --> 00:12:06,825
I'll read it to you.

93
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:12,033
"Dear Don, sometimes life
brings some strange surprises.

94
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:14,700
"It's been almost 20 years
since we've seen each other,

95
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:18,158
"but now there's something
I need to tell you.

96
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:21,783
"Years ago, after our story ended,

97
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,075
"I discovered I was pregnant.

98
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,741
"I decided to go through with the
pregnancy, and I had a baby, a son.

99
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:30,741
"Your son.

100
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:33,783
"I decided to raise him by myself
because our time together...

101
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:36,575
"had come to a close.

102
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,033
"My son is now almost 19.

103
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:43,991
"He's somewhat shy and secretive,
unlike you,

104
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,325
"but a sensitive, wonderful person.

105
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,783
"A few days ago he left
on a mysterious road trip,

106
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:52,950
"but I'm almost certain
he's searching for his father.

107
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:55,616
"I've told him almost nothing about you,

108
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,158
"but he's resourceful and imaginative.

109
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:01,950
"Anyway, if this is, in fact,
your correct address,

110
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:04,866
well, I just felt
I should let you know."

111
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:09,116
There's no signature...

112
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,450
and no return address.

113
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,283
Hey, congratulations!
You're a father.

114
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,825
Uh, you're really upset by this.
C-Can I see it?

115
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:33,950
Your address is handwritten,

116
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:35,991
but printed.

117
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:38,366
Red ink on pink paper.

118
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:41,950
Typewriter.

119
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,616
<i>A red ribbon. Curious.</i>

120
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:53,033
"Dear Don, sometimes"-

121
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:54,950
Hmm.

122
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:02,741
Damn. This postmark is too
faint to read. That's fucked up.

123
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,658
Tsk-tsk.

124
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:08,783
And you have no idea
who this is from?

125
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,075
Nope.

126
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,991
None.

127
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:15,116
But from all I know,

128
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:18,033
you are like, uh-
like Don Juan or something.

129
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,158
Don Juan.

130
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,825
I gotta go.

131
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:37,241
You want me to keep the letter
for forensic evidence or... clues?

132
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:39,408
Or- Don.

133
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,908
Hmm.

134
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:09,241
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

135
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,241
I see that.

136
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,533
It's kind of lonely in here, man.

137
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:26,533
Do you mind?

138
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:40,825
Is Sherry coming home?
No.

139
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,533
She left.

140
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,491
<i>What do you mean, "She left"?
She went on a trip?</i>

141
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:50,283
No. I mean, she left.

142
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,741
Sorry, man.

143
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:57,325
Yeah, me too. I think.

144
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:03,950
Well, but knowing Sherry, she probably
hasn't played her last card yet. Right?

145
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:05,908
Probably not.

146
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:10,033
Anyway, you've never had trouble
finding interesting females.

147
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:12,616
I mean, uh, that's the way your life
has been though. Right?

148
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:15,033
You're like, uh- like Don Juan.

149
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:18,325
Winston, please stop saying that.

150
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,158
Hey.

151
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:30,616
About this letter- I did examine
the postmark under my microscope.

152
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:34,116
<i>And it is too faint to read,
but the stamp-</i>

153
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:36,116
it's got on it a woodpecker.

154
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,325
<i>What does that mean to you?
Anything?</i>

155
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:44,991
Well, what I think we should do...

156
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:47,241
is to narrow down the possibilities.

157
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:50,325
Winston, this is probably
someone playing a joke on me.

158
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:53,075
If not, then...

159
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,033
whatever.

160
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:59,408
It seems so unfair-
someone to write a letter like this...

161
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,533
and-and-and not sign it?

162
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:03,991
Don't you want to know
who is the mother of your son?

163
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:07,032
My hypothetical son?
No, Winston.

164
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:08,991
<i>I don't, okay?</i>

165
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:11,782
Okay.

166
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,657
Then we can just drop it.
<i>We can?</i>

167
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:17,657
We can, of course. Okay.

168
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:19,825
<i>Good.</i>
It's dropped.

169
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,700
But then how can you ignore
something like this?

170
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:45,116
- You need to treat this as a sign.
- What kind of sign?

171
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,116
<i>Of the direction of your life.</i>

172
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,532
Of this present moment.

173
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:53,407
<i>You need to solve this mystery...</i>

174
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:57,991
and find out which of your women it was that
you impregnated with your semen 20 years ago.

175
00:17:58,116 --> 00:17:59,950
Winston.

176
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:06,366
<i>What happened to
that groovin' CD I burned for you?</i>

177
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:12,241
Here it is. Do you mind?

178
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:25,825
Ah, that's nice.
Ethiopian sounds.

179
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,950
It's good for the heart.

180
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,866
Look, come over tomorrow
for, uh, Sunday brunch,

181
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:46,991
and, uh, we'll talk a little further
about our investigative plan, huh?

182
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:48,991
So I'll leave that right there.

183
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,032
Go home and leave me alone.

184
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:53,325
Okay, man. I love you too.

185
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,741
I think your father's real name
is Sam Spade.

186
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:24,157
My father isn't Sam Spade.

187
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:27,325
No? Think he's Sherlock Holmes?

188
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:29,782
No.

189
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:33,325
Well, I know he's one of those
famous detectives. Mike Hammer!

190
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,491
No, not Mike Hammer.

191
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:39,450
Oh, I know.
He's that Dolemite guy. Right?

192
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:42,241
No, not Dolemite.
No?

193
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,200
He's down.

194
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,907
Keep your eyes open.
He may be Dolemite. No!

195
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:58,866
Mona,

196
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,782
thank you.

197
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:04,616
That was so delicious.
You're welcome. Anytime.

198
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:06,575
Really?
Mm-hmm.

199
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,325
What time's dinner?

200
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,950
You are the most perfect woman
in the world.

201
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:14,032
Hey, hey, hey.
Let me tell you something. That's mine.

202
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:16,157
Come, come, come.

203
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,450
No cigarettes.

204
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,282
That's where you get your appetite.

205
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:31,282
Your woman cooks too good.

206
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:35,366
I'd like to look at that pink
letter again. Let me see it.

207
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:39,241
I burned it last night- microwave.
Yes, little Rita?

208
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:41,241
Papa, you're smoking again.

209
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,700
No, no, no. This is just herbs.
It's just a little Cheeba. Hmm?

210
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:46,700
Let me see that.

211
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:53,950
He's right.
It's just <i>cannabis sativa.</i>

212
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:55,950
You see?
Just a little indigo, baby.

213
00:20:56,075 --> 00:20:59,366
'Cause Mama says,
"No more smoking tobacco anymore."

214
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,700
Yeah, I know. I gave it up. Never!

215
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:05,491
Never! No more tobacco.
I promise. Okay.

216
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:12,366
Come, come, come, come.
Let me see this mysterious pink letter.

217
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:34,075
Okay. What you have to
do for me is make a list.

218
00:21:35,116 --> 00:21:37,325
A list.

219
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,366
I need the possibilities
of who the mother might be.

220
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:45,450
You give me a list of all your
girlfriends from back then,

221
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:47,741
and then I can plan everything.

222
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Uh, I think I'm going home, Sherlock.

223
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:56,825
Just destroy that letter when
you're through with it, will you?

224
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,657
Work on that list.

225
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:14,950
Hello, Winston?

226
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:18,657
What list?

227
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:24,075
<i>No, haven't even thought about it.</i>

228
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,116
Are you on a cell phone?

229
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:30,616
Yeah. Is it okay if I run in
and grab that list?

230
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,200
Sure. Why not?
Great. Hold on a second.

231
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:43,116
Any other info
on where they might be?

232
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:46,282
Not really. That's where they
lived or their families lived.

233
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,657
That's all I can remember.
Good. Cool.

234
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:53,907
Okay. Sorry about that.
It's okay.

235
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:55,866
Look, man. I'm all over this.

236
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:58,782
The day after tomorrow,
I'll have everything ready.

237
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:00,866
Knock yourself out.

238
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,325
Don, man, my lunch break's almost over.
Sorry. What's up?

239
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,282
Look, I got all the info right here,
based on your list,

240
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,241
plus the whole plan.

241
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,782
You got addresses, married names,

242
00:24:16,907 --> 00:24:18,907
in some cases even their jobs.

243
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:20,866
I've got some sad news though.
What?

244
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:23,200
That girl named Michelle Pepe?

245
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:25,907
She died in a car accident...

246
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:27,825
<i>five years ago.</i>

247
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,450
I found the name of the cemetery
where she-well, where she is.

248
00:24:32,575 --> 00:24:34,657
Little Michelle Pepe?

249
00:24:34,782 --> 00:24:37,366
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.</i>

250
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:40,366
<i>But the other four-
I got all their info.</i>

251
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:44,157
Well, that's...
very impressive, Winston.

252
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,657
I really don't know why you did all of
this. What am I supposed to do about it?

253
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:50,116
Look, your whole trip-
it's all planned.

254
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:53,491
Booked reservations, rental cars.
Everything you need.

255
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:57,325
- All you have to do is give them the credit card.
- What are you talking about?

256
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,200
You go visit them.
You go to their houses. You see them.

257
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:04,200
You bring flowers, pink flowers.
You're just checking in.

258
00:25:06,116 --> 00:25:07,866
Just checking in.

259
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:11,575
<i>I even got maps.
Everything you need.</i>

260
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,950
And I burned you a new CD, see?

261
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:19,200
That's traveling music.
<i>That I'll take.</i>

262
00:25:21,032 --> 00:25:23,950
Uh, just coffee, please, Avis.
Thank you.

263
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:27,407
A few tips though.
Dress conservative, a little classy.

264
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:29,325
Don't give anything away.

265
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,366
And always, always bring flowers.
Pink flowers.

266
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:36,325
<i>And look for clues about your son-
photographs, anything.</i>

267
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,907
<i>Or hints, like pink stationery
and red ink.</i>

268
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:42,407
<i>Handwriting, if possible.
And find that typewriter.</i>

269
00:25:42,532 --> 00:25:44,616
Bring me that typewriter,

270
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:47,325
and then I can forensically
match the type...

271
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,241
to the letter.

272
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:51,950
You're insane, Winston.

273
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:55,700
Even if you could possibly
rope me into this nonsense,

274
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:57,657
which you can't,

275
00:25:57,782 --> 00:26:00,782
I'm not a detective, I'm not a private
eye in one of your crime novels.

276
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:06,366
Forget it. No fuckin' way.

277
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:09,575
What, after all the work I've done?
<i>Well, you do it.</i>

278
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,116
You take the trip.
I'll pay for it.

279
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:15,032
<i>Me? Impossible.
I've got three jobs and five kids.</i>

280
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,741
<i>And, besides, it's your life.</i>

281
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:21,116
I've merely prepared the strategy.

282
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:23,450
But only you can solve the mystery.

283
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:25,532
And why is that?

284
00:26:25,657 --> 00:26:27,950
Because you understand women.

285
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,741
Let me ask you something.

286
00:26:44,782 --> 00:26:47,200
Suppose I took this ridiculous trip,

287
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:50,407
and say this kid really exists,

288
00:26:50,532 --> 00:26:53,157
and he shows up...
while I'm gone.

289
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:55,700
Don, don't worry.
I'll monitor your house every day.

290
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:58,200
Yeah? Then what?
What do you do? If he shows up?

291
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,575
He shows up. Don't worry.
I apprehend him.

292
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,741
Oh, okay. Great.
You apprehend him.

293
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:08,282
Look, I've got seven minutes
before I'm due to punch in.

294
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:12,575
Tomorrow morning, on my way to the
plant, I will drop you at the airport.

295
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,032
No problem.
I got you an early flight.

296
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:18,450
It's not gonna happen.
No way.

297
00:27:18,575 --> 00:27:21,532
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning
at 7:00 a.m. sharp.

298
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,032
 <i>My mom won't let me wear a bikini.<i></i> I can't
believe your mom let you come on this trip.</i>

299
00:30:37,157 --> 00:30:39,991
<i>Oh, she doesn't know. I mean, she knows,
but she thinks</i> <i>that I'm with your family.</i>

300
00:30:40,116 --> 00:30:42,325
<i>No, she wouldn't have let me come, and
you would have been</i> <i>totally mad at me.</i>

301
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,782
<i>What if she calls my mom? She's not gonna
call her.</i> <i>She thinks that she's here.</i>

302
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,366
See, it's perfect. No, it'll be fine.
Don't worry. Wait, wait, wait. What?

303
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:50,782
Don't even worry about it. Do I need to call
my mom? 'Cause my mom will totally lie for you.

304
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:54,450
<i>I want to go to the party tonight, and I
really want to be able</i> <i>to meet some cute guys.</i>

305
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:58,532
That guy is so cute that's sitting
behind me. Can you see him?

306
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,282
<i>Oh, my God. He's really cute though.</i>
<i>Don't stare at him.</i>

307
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:03,282
<i>He is cute.
He looks like a supermodel.</i>

308
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:07,491
<i>No, he looks like the Calvin Klein model that's
on the side of the bus.</i> <i>Oh, my gosh. He's so cool.</i>

309
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,907
<i>He's totally staring at us right now. Think Ally will take
us to get something</i> <i>to eat before we go? I'm starving!</i>

310
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:13,657
<i>That's why you need the
mix-and-match</i> <i>for when you get fat.</i>

311
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:16,282
<i>Oh, my God. I know! We're such heifers.</i>
<i>You get the bigger sizes.</i>

312
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,616
<i>I look so fat.
Doughnut girl.</i>

313
00:32:33,157 --> 00:32:35,366
<i>Look for clues,</i>

314
00:32:35,491 --> 00:32:38,366
<i>like a typewriter,
like something pink.</i>

315
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,866
<i>This will be very easy.</i>

316
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:24,450
Hi, Laura. It's me, Don.
Remember me?

317
00:34:27,824 --> 00:34:30,157
Hi. Who are you?

318
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:33,532
Don Johnston.
Really?

319
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:36,324
You're Don Johnson?
Yeah- No.

320
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,324
Johnston with a "T." Oh.

321
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:41,407
Uh, does Laura Daniels, who was
formerly Laura Miller, live here?

322
00:34:41,532 --> 00:34:43,282
Yeah. That's my mom.

323
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:45,324
Well, I'm a very old friend of hers,

324
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:48,032
and I haven't seen her
in, um, in over-

325
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:50,074
Well, come on in.

326
00:34:56,407 --> 00:35:00,699
So, my how'll be home from work soon,
so just sit down. Here.

327
00:35:00,824 --> 00:35:02,657
Make yourself comfortable.

328
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:08,574
So, my name's Lola.

329
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:13,074
Well, sometimes people call me Lo,
but my really real name is Lolita.

330
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,032
Lolita?

331
00:35:16,117 --> 00:35:19,324
Yeah.

332
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:26,199
Well, l-I don't- Do you want something?
'Cause we've got Popsicles.

333
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,992
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

334
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:33,157
<i>Lolita.</i>
Yeah?

335
00:35:34,657 --> 00:35:37,742
Do you have any brothers
or sisters? <i>Why?</i>

336
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:40,157
Do you think I need some?

337
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,657
Oh, wait, that's my phone.

338
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:47,949
Just-Just stay there.
I'll be right back, okay?

339
00:35:48,074 --> 00:35:50,367
<i>Okay.</i>

340
00:36:50,782 --> 00:36:54,199
That's so crazy.

341
00:36:54,324 --> 00:36:56,574
Really?

342
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:58,367
<i>That's so sick.</i>

343
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:01,992
He didn't. Wait. Hold on.
My cell phone's ringing. Hello?

344
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:05,574
<i>Yeah. I know. I just talked to her.</i>

345
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:07,617
That's crazy, right?

346
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:09,617
<i>I know.</i>

347
00:37:37,157 --> 00:37:39,574
Can I help you with something?

348
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:49,199
Donny, is that you?

349
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:53,367
Hey, Laura.

350
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:58,242
What are you doing here?

351
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,867
We're having chicken for dinner.

352
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:30,324
That was quite an outfit
you weren't wearing earlier.

353
00:38:33,117 --> 00:38:35,574
Well, here we are.

354
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:55,324
<i>Then Larry exploded
in a ball of flames at the track.</i>

355
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,742
That happened,
and now it's just me and Lo.

356
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:08,032
It was even on TV.

357
00:39:11,117 --> 00:39:13,492
I'm sorry.

358
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:19,199
Lo, your head looks
just like a pineapple.

359
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,992
- Mom!
- Doesn't it?

360
00:39:22,117 --> 00:39:24,742
Yeah, it does look like a pineapple.

361
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:30,242
So, what, uh-

362
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:34,907
Where do you work?
Oh, Mom has her own business. Right?

363
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:36,824
Yeah.
Really?

364
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:39,282
I'm a professional closet organizer.

365
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:42,617
Come on.
No, I organize people's closets.

366
00:39:43,742 --> 00:39:45,742
I even do their drawers.

367
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:49,992
I label everything.
I get them all organized.

368
00:39:50,117 --> 00:39:52,282
I even color coordinate them.

369
00:39:52,407 --> 00:39:55,657
Yeah. And they pay her for that.
It's amazing.

370
00:39:55,782 --> 00:39:58,492
- Hmm.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

371
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:04,324
Lolita, I said you- Lolita!

372
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:06,242
I said you could have a taste.

373
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:10,074
Now, come on. That's enough of that.
That's not cool.

374
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,574
Lolita. Interesting choice
of name, Laura.

375
00:40:17,407 --> 00:40:19,242
What?

376
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:26,282
<i>So, Donny, I heard you made it big
in business a few years ago?</i>

377
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:29,242
What are you into?

378
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,992
It was computers.
Oh, high-tech stuff.

379
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,032
More high tech than pencils, I guess.

380
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:37,492
Mr. Fancy Pants!

381
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:42,907
<i>Yeah, my pants are fancy.
So what?</i>

382
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:49,992
So I see you're having a yard sale?

383
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:53,282
Uh, you got me.
It's something we do on Saturdays.

384
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:56,367
Yeah, Larry had all this crap
in the garage, and-

385
00:40:56,492 --> 00:40:59,742
And then I got this neighbor
to paint a sign for us.

386
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:01,657
It's fun.

387
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:05,032
Are you gonna be selling
any old, uh, typewriters?

388
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:07,324
No.

389
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:09,782
Wh- That's so 20th century.

390
00:41:11,492 --> 00:41:14,617
Did you come all the way down here
to get a typewriter, Don?

391
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:19,032
What do you want a typewriter for?

392
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:23,242
An old friend asked me if I would
look around for a typewriter.

393
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:26,824
So... I just remembered it.

394
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,407
Well-

395
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:38,074
You know, I forgot to make dessert.

396
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,074
Oh, Don doesn't like Popsicles.

397
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:16,742
Donny.

398
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,742
What are you doing here?

399
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:23,117
I was just looking for a typewriter.

400
00:42:23,242 --> 00:42:25,282
Oh.

401
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:27,824
I remember.

402
00:42:38,742 --> 00:42:40,574
Bye.

403
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:48,449
Hey.

404
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:56,657
Bye, Don.

405
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,157
Good-bye, Laura.

406
00:43:03,742 --> 00:43:05,574
<i>Come back sometime.</i>

407
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:07,532
<i>See you, Laura.</i>

408
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:27,782
Lo! Go.
Put some clothes on.

409
00:46:44,242 --> 00:46:46,824
Can I help you?
Dora?

410
00:46:46,949 --> 00:46:49,324
Yes.

411
00:46:49,449 --> 00:46:51,532
It's me, Don.

412
00:46:51,657 --> 00:46:54,117
Remember me?

413
00:46:54,242 --> 00:46:56,074
Oh, Don!

414
00:46:57,742 --> 00:47:00,074
What-What are you doing here?

415
00:47:01,657 --> 00:47:03,574
I brought these flowers.

416
00:47:09,282 --> 00:47:11,617
So beautiful.

417
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:15,117
Wanna come in?

418
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:38,782
So,

419
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:42,742
what brings you out here?

420
00:47:44,032 --> 00:47:47,782
Well, I was kind of in the area,
so I thought I'd drop in.

421
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,157
I see.

422
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:53,367
How- How did you
track me down, exactly?

423
00:47:53,492 --> 00:47:55,699
Uh, on the computer.

424
00:47:55,824 --> 00:47:57,699
They can do anything.

425
00:48:11,282 --> 00:48:13,157
Nice place you've got here.

426
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:16,157
<i>Oh, thank you.
It's a nice example.</i>

427
00:48:16,324 --> 00:48:18,199
My husband and I are in real estate.

428
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:20,617
<i>We sell landscape lots...</i>

429
00:48:20,742 --> 00:48:23,907
and preconstructed designer homes.

430
00:48:24,032 --> 00:48:27,532
Or do you already have this information
from your computer?

431
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:29,699
<i>No.</i>

432
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,532
Your card is pink.

433
00:48:34,074 --> 00:48:35,867
Yes.

434
00:48:35,992 --> 00:48:39,532
Ron, my husband, thought it would be cute
if mine were pink and his blue.

435
00:48:48,449 --> 00:48:51,157
I like those pearls.

436
00:48:53,449 --> 00:48:55,282
<i>Did I give you those?</i>

437
00:48:59,992 --> 00:49:01,867
I don't think so.

438
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:05,699
<i>I should have.</i>

439
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:19,032
It's very strange,
your showing up like this.

440
00:49:22,532 --> 00:49:24,407
Yeah, it <i>is</i> strange.

441
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:32,992
It's my husband.

442
00:49:34,032 --> 00:49:37,574
<i>Hey! Where's my perfect little wi-</i>

443
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:40,532
<i>Well, what have we here?</i>

444
00:49:42,907 --> 00:49:45,282
Hi. Don Johnston.

445
00:49:47,032 --> 00:49:49,157
I'm a really old
friend of Dora's. Oh.

446
00:49:49,282 --> 00:49:52,907
You don't look <i>really</i> old.
Just kinda old.

447
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,242
<i>I'm Ron.</i>

448
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,699
<i>Don Johnston.</i>
Mm-hmm.

449
00:49:58,824 --> 00:50:01,617
That's an old flame of yours,
right, honey?

450
00:50:01,742 --> 00:50:04,867
Don just dropped in
completely unexpectedly.

451
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:08,992
<i>Wow! Nice to meet you, Don.</i>

452
00:50:09,117 --> 00:50:11,157
Ron and Don.

453
00:50:13,282 --> 00:50:16,532
Hey, uh, is Don gonna stay
for dinner? I hope.

454
00:50:16,657 --> 00:50:20,074
No. I really couldn't.

455
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:22,324
Well, sure you could.

456
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:25,074
Right? Honey?

457
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:39,199
<i>Computers, huh? Wow.</i>

458
00:50:39,324 --> 00:50:41,657
<i>That's gotta be a lucrative field.</i>

459
00:50:41,782 --> 00:50:43,867
Yeah, I've done pretty well.

460
00:50:43,992 --> 00:50:48,117
Hmm. Well, the real estate biz
has been very good to us.

461
00:50:48,242 --> 00:50:50,032
<i>Right, hon?</i>

462
00:50:50,157 --> 00:50:52,867
At first I had the idea
of going into bottled water.

463
00:50:52,992 --> 00:50:57,117
I think in the near future, water
will be worth more than oil or gold.

464
00:50:57,242 --> 00:51:01,992
<i>Yeah. You're dying of thirst,
you can't take a swig of oil.</i>

465
00:51:02,117 --> 00:51:03,907
Right?

466
00:51:04,032 --> 00:51:06,782
Or gold, for that matter.

467
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:10,492
Boy, you are certainly
right about that.

468
00:51:10,617 --> 00:51:12,742
But for right now,

469
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:16,282
we decided that real estate
and quality prefab homes...

470
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,532
was the right way to go.

471
00:51:18,657 --> 00:51:21,699
And it has been quite lucrative.

472
00:51:27,992 --> 00:51:30,657
Hon, those are beautiful flowers.

473
00:51:30,782 --> 00:51:32,657
Mmm.

474
00:51:36,532 --> 00:51:38,657
Hey!

475
00:51:38,782 --> 00:51:41,617
Don, I want to show you something.
Excuse me.

476
00:51:51,782 --> 00:51:53,574
Isn't this the coolest photo?

477
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:56,367
Wow. Yeah.

478
00:51:56,492 --> 00:51:59,324
Yeah?
This is crazy, right?

479
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,324
My straight little Dora.

480
00:52:02,782 --> 00:52:05,117
My adorable little Dora.
Mmm.

481
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,449
Young hippie chick.

482
00:52:08,574 --> 00:52:11,657
That is great, Ron.
Now, could you please put it back?

483
00:52:11,782 --> 00:52:13,657
Sorry, baby.

484
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,949
Probably brings back
one or two memories, huh, Don?

485
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:24,199
I took that photo, didn't I?

486
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:28,032
Mm-hmm.

487
00:52:30,992 --> 00:52:33,949
Well, you know, it's strange...

488
00:52:34,074 --> 00:52:37,074
how people's lives change, isn't it?

489
00:52:47,032 --> 00:52:48,907
So, any kids?

490
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:57,657
Well, that's-
that's kind of a touchy subject.

491
00:52:57,782 --> 00:53:00,617
See, I always wanted
to have kids with Dora.

492
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:03,032
You know, I mean, kids of our own.

493
00:53:03,157 --> 00:53:07,367
<i>But she didn't, really,
so I respect that.</i>

494
00:53:07,492 --> 00:53:11,907
Oh, I don't know if I would have had the
time and patience to be a good mother...

495
00:53:12,032 --> 00:53:14,407
to- to Ron's children.

496
00:53:17,074 --> 00:53:19,574
I'm just happy to have my Dora.

497
00:53:30,324 --> 00:53:32,117
What about you, Don?

498
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,117
You married?

499
00:53:35,992 --> 00:53:37,867
No, I'm still a bachelor.

500
00:53:39,242 --> 00:53:41,532
A bachelor?

501
00:53:41,657 --> 00:53:43,449
Wow.

502
00:53:43,574 --> 00:53:46,574
But any kids?
He said he was still a bachelor.

503
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:49,742
Well, honey, you know-

504
00:53:49,867 --> 00:53:53,157
You never know.
One or two could have gotten away.

505
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:56,867
No. No kids I know of.

506
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:27,532
Hello, Winston.

507
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,492
Just a crazy guess.

508
00:55:32,782 --> 00:55:35,532
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing up here.

509
00:55:35,657 --> 00:55:37,532
I'm gettin' nowhere.

510
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:41,032
Yeah, I saw her.

511
00:55:41,157 --> 00:55:43,949
Yeah, I saw her too.

512
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,492
Yesterday.

513
00:55:47,074 --> 00:55:49,157
No. No clues.

514
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:51,117
No typewriters.

515
00:55:53,782 --> 00:55:58,449
Couldn't you have rented me, like, a Porsche
or some car that I might really drive?

516
00:55:58,574 --> 00:56:01,367
I'm a stalker in a Taurus.

517
00:56:04,324 --> 00:56:08,032
I have done everything
that you wanted me to do, you know.

518
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:10,117
I've really had enough of this.

519
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,657
I think I oughta go back today.

520
00:56:14,282 --> 00:56:17,617
Yeah, but l- I don't-
I don't think I wanna see her.

521
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:23,242
No, Winston-

522
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,532
Winston, let me-
let me talk to you later, okay?

523
00:56:28,657 --> 00:56:30,782
Can I just-Yeah.

524
00:56:30,907 --> 00:56:33,242
Let me talk to you later.
Please?

525
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,699
Okay? Thanks.

526
00:57:54,449 --> 00:57:57,367
I'll talk to you in a while.
Okay?

527
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,657
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we're now on our final descent.</i>

528
00:58:16,782 --> 00:58:19,992
<i>Please return to your seats and make sure your
seat belts</i> <i>are securely fastened. Thank you.</i>

529
00:59:52,742 --> 00:59:54,532
I heard what you said.

530
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,657
And I heard what Dr. Markowski said.

531
00:59:56,782 --> 00:59:59,574
<i>You have to believe in yourself.</i>

532
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:01,657
<i>I have a lot of respect for you.</i>

533
01:00:01,782 --> 01:00:03,992
<i>I understand how you feel.</i>

534
01:00:04,117 --> 01:00:06,867
<i>I understand, and I'll try
to do better next time.</i>

535
01:00:06,992 --> 01:00:08,782
Hi.

536
01:00:08,907 --> 01:00:12,867
It takes a lot of courage to say
what you said. I'm very proud of you.

537
01:00:12,992 --> 01:00:16,742
<i>And I want you to know that
I think you're doing very, very well...</i>

538
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:18,782
<i>and I believe in you.</i>

539
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:21,367
Yeah, she definitely
speaks to iguanas.

540
01:00:22,824 --> 01:00:24,617
<i>Okay. That's right.</i>

541
01:00:24,742 --> 01:00:27,949
<i>Call back on Monday
and we'll happily schedule you and Iggy.</i>

542
01:00:28,074 --> 01:00:30,949
Sure.
Mm-kay. Thank you.

543
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:35,324
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnston, but Dr.
Markowski only takes appointments,

544
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:37,907
and she's in a session right now.

545
01:00:38,032 --> 01:00:40,157
Is your animal friend with you?

546
01:00:40,282 --> 01:00:43,074
Uh, no, l-l-I don't have
an animal friend.

547
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:46,742
I'm an old friend of Carm-
uh, Dr. Markowski's.

548
01:00:46,867 --> 01:00:49,117
Um, Carmen has
a really tight schedule.

549
01:00:49,242 --> 01:00:52,032
She may have a minute,
if you want to sit down.

550
01:00:52,157 --> 01:00:54,199
Yeah, okay.

551
01:01:55,282 --> 01:01:58,117
<i>No, no, no.
Of course I won't forget you, Cleo.</i>

552
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,242
<i>Yes, I promise.</i>

553
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:03,657
<i>Thank you, Dr. Markowski.</i> <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

554
01:02:03,782 --> 01:02:06,157
- Bye now.
- Bye, Cleo.

555
01:02:06,282 --> 01:02:08,117
See you next week, Mrs. Dorston.

556
01:02:17,532 --> 01:02:19,407
So, what do we have next?

557
01:02:26,657 --> 01:02:29,282
Don?

558
01:02:37,074 --> 01:02:39,407
So, you're an animal psychic?

559
01:02:39,532 --> 01:02:42,324
No.
I'm a communicator.

560
01:02:43,449 --> 01:02:45,699
And you're a doctor now?
Mmm.

561
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:50,617
When we were together, you were so
passionate about becoming a lawyer.

562
01:02:50,742 --> 01:02:52,657
I mean, you were...

563
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:55,867
very passionate.

564
01:02:55,992 --> 01:02:59,574
Yeah, well, passion's a funny thing.

565
01:03:01,617 --> 01:03:03,867
<i>I have a doctorate
in animal behavior.</i>

566
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:07,532
But that was sort of after the fact.

567
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:10,867
It's an odd story.

568
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:14,492
I'm getting into odd stories.

569
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:17,949
Well, I was a very successful lawyer.

570
01:03:19,492 --> 01:03:21,782
I had no life, though,
outside my work,

571
01:03:21,907 --> 01:03:24,449
except for my dog, Winston.

572
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:29,074
Your dog's named Winston?

573
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:31,992
<i>Yes.</i>

574
01:03:32,117 --> 01:03:33,907
<i>But then he died...</i>

575
01:03:34,032 --> 01:03:35,907
suddenly.

576
01:03:37,407 --> 01:03:40,157
I'm sorry. Oh, no. It was, uh-

577
01:03:40,282 --> 01:03:42,117
It was years ago.

578
01:03:42,242 --> 01:03:45,367
But my new ability was this gift.

579
01:03:46,867 --> 01:03:48,699
This gift from Winston.

580
01:04:06,032 --> 01:04:08,532
All right, you can come in again.

581
01:04:13,742 --> 01:04:15,574
Anyway,

582
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:18,367
<i>after Winston died I got this gift.</i>

583
01:04:18,492 --> 01:04:20,742
<i>To-</i>

584
01:04:20,867 --> 01:04:23,032
To read animals' minds?
<i>No. I told you-</i>

585
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:26,324
- No.
- I'm a communicator.

586
01:04:28,324 --> 01:04:30,992
You see, soon after Winston died...

587
01:04:32,242 --> 01:04:35,617
I realized that I could
hear animals speak to me.

588
01:04:35,742 --> 01:04:40,074
I mean, I certainly hadn't
been aware of that before.

589
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:42,199
And I don't read animals' minds.

590
01:04:42,324 --> 01:04:44,907
<i>But when they want to communicate,</i>

591
01:04:45,032 --> 01:04:47,449
<i>I can hear them.</i>

592
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,949
You know, like you and I are talking.

593
01:04:50,074 --> 01:04:53,074
<i>But we don't read each other's minds.</i>

594
01:04:57,699 --> 01:04:59,992
Is he saying something?

595
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:10,617
He says you have a hidden agenda.

596
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:15,074
He- He said that?

597
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:19,532
I think you'd better
go back outside now, Ramon.

598
01:05:27,742 --> 01:05:29,532
<i>Animals can tell us what they want,</i>

599
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:33,449
but that doesn't mean
that that's what's best for them.

600
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,657
<i>Yes?</i>

601
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:44,074
Excuse me, Carmen, but Mr. Renaldo and
Skippy are here for your next session.

602
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:45,992
Oh. Okay.

603
01:05:46,117 --> 01:05:49,032
Um, give me one more minute.

604
01:05:59,324 --> 01:06:03,074
<i>Sorry, Don, but I really
can't keep Skippy waiting.</i>

605
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:08,324
Do you think you could tell Skippy
that you're just gonna walk me to my car?

606
01:06:11,657 --> 01:06:14,407
How about later?
Wanna get a drink?

607
01:06:14,532 --> 01:06:16,324
No. I don't drink.

608
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:18,242
Maybe get something to eat?

609
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:21,074
I don't, uh, eat.

610
01:06:22,907 --> 01:06:24,699
You don't?

611
01:06:24,824 --> 01:06:27,617
Uh, take a walk?

612
01:06:27,742 --> 01:06:30,532
I know you walk.
I don't feel like it.

613
01:06:34,117 --> 01:06:35,907
Do you have a typewriter?

614
01:06:36,032 --> 01:06:37,907
A typewriter?

615
01:06:41,449 --> 01:06:43,907
Are you married?

616
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:46,949
You know, I think you
should probably go now.

617
01:06:47,074 --> 01:06:48,949
Oh, come on, Carmen.

618
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:52,492
Can't you answer me?
No.

619
01:06:53,824 --> 01:06:55,617
"No," you won't answer me?

620
01:06:55,742 --> 01:06:59,032
No, I'm not married.

621
01:07:01,032 --> 01:07:02,907
I was though.

622
01:07:04,742 --> 01:07:06,867
Any kids?

623
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:11,242
Yes.

624
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:15,699
<i>I have a daughter, Lianna.
She's 16.</i>

625
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,532
She's in Sweden.

626
01:07:19,657 --> 01:07:21,617
Sweden.

627
01:07:21,742 --> 01:07:23,992
Am I supposed to ask about you?

628
01:07:24,117 --> 01:07:26,907
<i>It seems like I've told you
my whole life story.</i>

629
01:07:27,032 --> 01:07:28,824
<i>So-</i>
Me? No.

630
01:07:28,949 --> 01:07:30,742
I'm not married.

631
01:07:30,867 --> 01:07:32,699
<i>Of course you aren't.</i>

632
01:07:34,574 --> 01:07:37,242
And I don't have any kids.

633
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,242
Do I?

634
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,199
How would I know that?

635
01:07:45,532 --> 01:07:48,907
Sorry, Carmen, but Mr. Renaldo and Skippy
have been waiting in the session room.

636
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:51,282
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll be right there.

637
01:07:51,407 --> 01:07:53,282
Okay.

638
01:07:59,824 --> 01:08:02,907
Well, my time is really up.

639
01:08:03,032 --> 01:08:06,074
So, good-bye.

640
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:08,117
<i>Bye, Carmen.</i>

641
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:32,117
<i>Mr. Johnston?
You forgot your flowers.</i>

642
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,742
Hey. Excuse me!
Excuse me.

643
01:11:39,824 --> 01:11:43,492
Excuse me. Uh, do you know
where Atwood Road is?

644
01:11:43,617 --> 01:11:46,074
I'm lost.

645
01:13:01,908 --> 01:13:03,367
Oh!

646
01:13:03,492 --> 01:13:06,242
<i>Hey.</i>

647
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:08,492
Hey, it's okay.

648
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:12,074
It's okay.

649
01:13:13,033 --> 01:13:14,824
Can I help you?

650
01:13:14,949 --> 01:13:16,949
Does Penny live here?

651
01:13:17,074 --> 01:13:18,992
Who's askin'?

652
01:13:20,324 --> 01:13:24,658
I'm an old friend of Penny's.
Don. Don Johnston.

653
01:13:26,867 --> 01:13:30,199
She's in the house.
Go around there. A screen door.

654
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:32,199
Thanks.

655
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:11,533
Penny?

656
01:14:21,949 --> 01:14:23,824
Hello?

657
01:14:25,242 --> 01:14:27,658
- Penny?
- Yeah?

658
01:14:35,742 --> 01:14:37,617
Donny.

659
01:14:44,283 --> 01:14:47,324
So, what the fuck do <i>you</i> want, Donny?

660
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:51,449
Oh, I just thought I'd drop by.

661
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:53,449
Just checking in.

662
01:14:56,449 --> 01:14:59,449
Well, I don't remember any
happy ending between us, Don.

663
01:14:59,574 --> 01:15:03,324
No... reconciliation, nothing.

664
01:15:03,449 --> 01:15:05,908
You left <i>me,</i> Penny.
Remember?

665
01:15:06,033 --> 01:15:08,367
Yeah.

666
01:15:08,492 --> 01:15:10,367
Very clearly.

667
01:15:13,117 --> 01:15:15,908
So, what is it you wanted?

668
01:15:16,033 --> 01:15:17,992
Everything okay over there, Pen?

669
01:15:19,783 --> 01:15:21,617
Not sure yet!

670
01:15:22,617 --> 01:15:24,492
Goddamn it.

671
01:15:25,574 --> 01:15:27,783
What is it you wanted?

672
01:15:31,283 --> 01:15:33,117
Penny, do you-

673
01:15:34,574 --> 01:15:36,449
Do you have a son?

674
01:15:43,242 --> 01:15:45,117
Fuck you, Donny!

675
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,283
Danny, grab that fucker.

676
01:15:59,158 --> 01:16:00,992
<i>Penny!</i>

677
01:16:02,908 --> 01:16:05,117
Shut up.

678
01:16:05,242 --> 01:16:07,117
I didn't say anything.

679
01:16:27,283 --> 01:16:30,074
What the hell's your fuckin' problem?
I was just leaving.

680
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:33,367
No, what are you doing upsetting Penny like
that, huh? I just needed to ask her a question.

681
01:16:33,492 --> 01:16:36,283
Yeah, I know you asked her a question.
Now, listen.

682
01:16:36,408 --> 01:16:40,158
I just don't think
it's very sensitive of you...

683
01:16:40,283 --> 01:16:43,074
comin' out here
to try to hurt Penny's feelings,

684
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,658
you know,
to get back at her or whatever.

685
01:16:49,367 --> 01:16:51,158
That just seems so rude.

686
01:19:11,492 --> 01:19:13,074
You said all pink, right?

687
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:16,492
<i>It's best that they're all pink, yeah.</i>

688
01:19:22,117 --> 01:19:23,908
Oh, you're very good at this.

689
01:19:24,033 --> 01:19:26,949
That's beautiful.
Thanks.

690
01:19:27,074 --> 01:19:28,867
Are you okay?

691
01:19:28,992 --> 01:19:32,699
Uh, it was just
a minor misunderstanding.

692
01:19:32,824 --> 01:19:35,574
Mind if I take a look?

693
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:41,742
<i>Oh. That's nasty.</i>

694
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:44,199
Did you even wash it?

695
01:19:44,324 --> 01:19:46,699
Sort of.

696
01:19:47,742 --> 01:19:49,617
Let me take care of it.

697
01:20:02,324 --> 01:20:04,117
What's your name?

698
01:20:04,242 --> 01:20:06,908
Sun. Sun Green.

699
01:20:07,033 --> 01:20:09,117
Sun Green?

700
01:20:09,242 --> 01:20:11,074
Perfect.

701
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,992
What's yours?

702
01:20:13,117 --> 01:20:14,908
Don.
Don Johnston.

703
01:20:15,033 --> 01:20:16,949
Really?

704
01:20:17,074 --> 01:20:19,699
Don Johnson?
<i>Johnston.</i>

705
01:20:19,824 --> 01:20:21,699
With a "T."

706
01:20:23,867 --> 01:20:25,742
So...

707
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:32,617
if I continue down this road,

708
01:20:32,742 --> 01:20:35,283
I will find the Riverview Cemetery?

709
01:20:35,408 --> 01:20:39,408
Yeah. You just go down the hill.
You'll see the entrance on your right.

710
01:20:45,617 --> 01:20:47,658
Thank you, Sun Green.

711
01:20:47,824 --> 01:20:49,658
You're welcome.

712
01:21:16,449 --> 01:21:18,324
Hello, beautiful.

713
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,617
Red ink on pink paper.

714
01:22:55,158 --> 01:22:57,199
I don't know what I want.

715
01:22:57,324 --> 01:22:59,324
<i>He says you have a hidden agenda.</i>

716
01:22:59,492 --> 01:23:01,324
Fuck you, Donny.

717
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:01,324
Circle Drive, please.
No rush.

718
01:24:44,658 --> 01:24:47,949
The wheel of fortune turns.
Round and round it goes.

719
01:24:48,074 --> 01:24:50,074
Where it stops, no one knows.

720
01:24:54,824 --> 01:24:56,699
Boy.

721
01:25:48,367 --> 01:25:51,033
That's my report, Sherlock.

722
01:25:51,158 --> 01:25:53,992
The general outline
of what you put me through.

723
01:25:55,492 --> 01:25:57,283
That's it?

724
01:25:57,408 --> 01:26:01,574
And after all that, you're still no closer
to knowing who's the mother of your son?

725
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:03,617
That's right.

726
01:26:04,783 --> 01:26:07,117
But there was that one typewriter.

727
01:26:07,283 --> 01:26:09,617
And the pink motorcycle.

728
01:26:09,742 --> 01:26:12,533
And it was Dora's pink,
uh, business card.

729
01:26:12,658 --> 01:26:14,699
And-And-And Laura's pink bathrobe.

730
01:26:14,824 --> 01:26:18,074
I think this whole thing
is a farce, a fiasco.

731
01:26:19,074 --> 01:26:21,074
As far as I know,

732
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:23,533
you may have written
that letter to me.

733
01:26:26,742 --> 01:26:29,992
Look, I'm really sorry
that you got beat up and everything.

734
01:26:30,117 --> 01:26:34,158
I feel that it was somehow my fault.

735
01:26:34,283 --> 01:26:36,158
It was.

736
01:26:38,617 --> 01:26:40,783
Kind of strange, too, how, uh,

737
01:26:40,908 --> 01:26:43,742
Carmen's magic dog was named Winston.

738
01:26:46,324 --> 01:26:48,617
Yeah-

739
01:26:48,742 --> 01:26:51,699
Look, man, I really put
a lot of work into this thing.

740
01:26:51,824 --> 01:26:55,533
I thought that it was really important
that you know whether or not you had a son.

741
01:26:55,658 --> 01:26:58,742
I mean, it's your life.
You got to live your life, right?

742
01:26:58,867 --> 01:27:01,533
I <i>was</i> living my life, Winston.

743
01:27:03,658 --> 01:27:05,908
I still am.

744
01:27:06,033 --> 01:27:08,992
What's this?
It's pink.

745
01:27:09,117 --> 01:27:11,908
It's a note I found in
my foyer when I got back.

746
01:27:12,033 --> 01:27:14,949
Red ink on pink paper.

747
01:27:15,117 --> 01:27:16,824
It's from Sherry.

748
01:27:16,949 --> 01:27:18,742
What? From Sherry?

749
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:22,074
Why didn't you tell me?
May I see it?

750
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:27,117
Envelope and paper
not exactly the same size.

751
01:27:29,158 --> 01:27:31,283
You know, the handwriting...

752
01:27:31,408 --> 01:27:35,199
seems pretty close to the address
on the envelope, but I can't be sure.

753
01:27:37,449 --> 01:27:39,367
Sherry still likes you.

754
01:27:41,867 --> 01:27:44,824
You think that Sherry
could have sent the first letter...

755
01:27:44,992 --> 01:27:48,033
and made the whole thing up
just to fuck with you?

756
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:49,992
Who knows?

757
01:27:51,492 --> 01:27:53,283
You know, I've got to go.

758
01:27:53,408 --> 01:27:57,242
I think I have just enough time to stop
home and compare the handwriting...

759
01:27:57,367 --> 01:28:00,242
and then hopefully
punch in at work on time.

760
01:28:00,367 --> 01:28:03,117
You coming?
No.

761
01:28:04,283 --> 01:28:07,158
I just need a little break
from all of this.

762
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:09,949
Look, don't worry.

763
01:28:10,074 --> 01:28:12,867
We're still going to
solve this mystery.

764
01:29:02,283 --> 01:29:05,033
Didn't I see you
at the airport last night?

765
01:29:05,158 --> 01:29:07,117
I don't know.
Did you?

766
01:29:07,242 --> 01:29:09,033
Yeah.

767
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:11,242
You on a road trip?

768
01:29:11,367 --> 01:29:13,242
Yeah.
Something like that.

769
01:29:16,783 --> 01:29:19,574
You look hungry.
Can I buy you a sandwich or something?

770
01:29:19,699 --> 01:29:21,492
Uh, no, that's okay.

771
01:29:21,617 --> 01:29:24,742
You can relax.
I'm not gay. I'm not a cop.

772
01:29:24,867 --> 01:29:27,783
Just a guy who sees a guy
who might need a sandwich.

773
01:29:30,033 --> 01:29:31,992
Okay. Thanks.

774
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:35,742
But could you get something to go?
I'd sorta rather stay outside.

775
01:29:35,867 --> 01:29:37,699
Sure.

776
01:29:37,824 --> 01:29:39,783
How about a nice club sandwich?

777
01:29:39,908 --> 01:29:41,783
I'm vegetarian.

778
01:29:42,908 --> 01:29:44,824
You eat cheese?

779
01:29:44,949 --> 01:29:47,617
Yeah, sometimes.
I like cheese.

780
01:29:48,908 --> 01:29:51,283
Okay, I got it.
I'll be right back.

781
01:30:06,992 --> 01:30:08,783
Thanks.
You're welcome.

782
01:30:38,324 --> 01:30:40,199
Hey.

783
01:30:41,283 --> 01:30:43,867
You found us a place.

784
01:30:43,992 --> 01:30:45,992
All right.

785
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,324
Let's see here.

786
01:30:51,449 --> 01:30:54,117
Big cheese and veggie sandwich...

787
01:30:54,242 --> 01:30:56,117
with mushrooms.

788
01:30:57,908 --> 01:30:59,742
Fries-
Mmm.

789
01:30:59,867 --> 01:31:01,742
extra large.

790
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,117
Two waters.

791
01:31:09,867 --> 01:31:11,742
Two coffees.

792
01:31:19,992 --> 01:31:22,574
My mom put that there...

793
01:31:22,699 --> 01:31:24,574
<i>for good luck.</i>

794
01:31:29,033 --> 01:31:31,283
Thanks for the food.

795
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:33,617
Ahh.
No problem, chief.

796
01:31:37,783 --> 01:31:39,699
You called me chief?

797
01:31:41,949 --> 01:31:43,867
Yeah. Why?

798
01:31:49,449 --> 01:31:51,324
What happened to your eye?

799
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:54,949
I, uh-

800
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:58,992
I ran into somebody.

801
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:01,492
Somebody's fist.

802
01:32:03,242 --> 01:32:06,033
You a gangster?

803
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:07,949
No. I wish.

804
01:32:08,074 --> 01:32:11,574
No, I was, uh- I was in computers.

805
01:32:13,158 --> 01:32:15,033
Computers and girls.

806
01:32:16,992 --> 01:32:18,783
What about you, chief?

807
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:21,824
I'm interested in, uh, philosophy.

808
01:32:24,033 --> 01:32:25,908
Philosophy and girls.

809
01:32:29,867 --> 01:32:31,742
Sounds pretty good.

810
01:32:32,949 --> 01:32:35,283
Think so?

811
01:32:41,699 --> 01:32:43,617
So, uh,

812
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:49,033
as just a guy
who gave another guy a sandwich,

813
01:32:51,658 --> 01:32:55,908
you have any, like,
philosophical tips or anything...

814
01:32:57,617 --> 01:33:00,617
for a guy on a kind of road trip?

815
01:33:01,658 --> 01:33:03,992
You asking me?

816
01:33:05,574 --> 01:33:07,408
Yeah.

817
01:33:08,533 --> 01:33:10,367
Well-

818
01:33:13,658 --> 01:33:16,283
The past is gone.

819
01:33:16,408 --> 01:33:18,324
I know that.

820
01:33:19,617 --> 01:33:22,117
The future...

821
01:33:22,242 --> 01:33:24,199
isn't here yet,

822
01:33:24,324 --> 01:33:26,199
whatever it's going to be.

823
01:33:27,699 --> 01:33:29,492
So,

824
01:33:29,617 --> 01:33:33,533
all there is is- is this.

825
01:33:34,908 --> 01:33:36,742
The present.

826
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:44,408
That's it.

827
01:33:46,658 --> 01:33:48,574
Are you a Buddhist?

828
01:33:50,533 --> 01:33:52,449
No. Are you?

829
01:33:53,908 --> 01:33:55,783
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

830
01:33:57,199 --> 01:34:01,367
I'm sorry that's the best
I have to offer at the moment.

831
01:34:01,492 --> 01:34:03,367
No, I appreciate it.

832
01:34:04,492 --> 01:34:06,867
I like what you said.

833
01:34:08,074 --> 01:34:11,283
It's better than some, like,

834
01:34:11,408 --> 01:34:13,449
fatherly-sounding bullshit.

835
01:34:16,699 --> 01:34:18,492
Is that...

836
01:34:18,617 --> 01:34:20,658
what your father's like?

837
01:34:27,117 --> 01:34:30,367
Ah, that's not a good subject.

838
01:34:30,492 --> 01:34:33,242
Hey, I gotta go, man.
I'm sorry.

839
01:34:33,367 --> 01:34:35,824
Thanks again
for the sandwich and stuff.

840
01:34:35,949 --> 01:34:37,824
Hold on a second.
Wait.

841
01:34:40,242 --> 01:34:43,617
I know you think
that I'm your father, don't you?

842
01:34:45,742 --> 01:34:48,949
What? Just tell me.
You can talk to me, chief.

843
01:34:49,074 --> 01:34:51,242
Man, you're fucked up.

844
01:34:51,367 --> 01:34:53,908
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Wait!
