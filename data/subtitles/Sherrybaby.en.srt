1
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:41,767
* There's an angel on my left. *

2
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:46,701
* But the devil's on my right. *

3
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:51,667
* I've been boxing shadows. *

4
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:54,667
* I tried to put up a fight. *

5
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:05,067
* So, brother, will you meet me
in the middle *

6
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:08,634
* so I can make it to the end? *

7
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:14,000
* It's not my first
second chance, *

8
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:18,734
* but, at this point,
who's counting, my friend? *

9
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:27,434
* It better be
some kind of heaven. *

10
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:33,801
* There better be some kind *

11
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,767
* of carnival in the sky *

12
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:41,767
* at the end of this ride. *

13
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:02,734
Excuse you.

14
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:05,667
Hey, excuse me.

15
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,968
Hey, sir, you just
bumped into me.

16
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:12,467
Fuckin' rude
motherfucker.

17
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:48,834
* So, brother, will you meet me
in the middle *

18
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:53,601
* so I can make it to the end? *

19
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:57,400
* It's not my first
second chance, *

20
00:02:57,401 --> 00:03:03,067
* but, at this point,
who's counting, my friend? *

21
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:12,601
* It better be
some kind of heaven. *

22
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:18,834
* There better be some kind *

23
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:23,467
* of carnival in the sky *

24
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:27,968
* at the end of this ride. *

25
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,968
Swanson,
95-G4-620.

26
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:56,901
Dorothy Washington,
house manager.

27
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,534
Come on in.

28
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,167
Most everyone's at work,

29
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:07,567
but this house
fills up real good

30
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:09,501
around 7:00,
8:00 at night.

31
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:10,734
<i>Your box came</i>
<i>yesterday.</i>

32
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:12,133
<i>Show me your</i>
<i>release sheet,</i>

33
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:14,400
<i>and then we'll</i>
<i>get you a room.</i>

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,400
<i>Ladies, this here</i>
<i>is Sherry Swanson.</i>

35
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,400
Hey.

36
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,334
<i>Hi.</i>

37
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:33,334
You got some privacy,

38
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:35,100
but we don't lock
bedroom doors.

39
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:36,601
This is for the locker

40
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:37,701
where you store
all your valuables,

41
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:38,701
in the corner, there.

42
00:04:38,702 --> 00:04:40,467
You get your house keys
after 30 days

43
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:41,868
with no write-ups:

44
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:43,400
no infractions
of our house rules,

45
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:45,200
do your chores,
all that.

46
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,033
I'm sure you'll be fine,
honey.

47
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:48,467
Yeah.

48
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,634
<i>Get the phone!</i>

49
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:22,701
<i>Do you like the blue ones,</i>
<i>the green ones?</i>

50
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:23,701
<i>The pink ones.</i>

51
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:24,868
<i>What size are you?</i>

52
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:25,868
Bobby?

53
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:27,033
<i>Hello?</i>

54
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:28,734
Hey, it's Sherry.

55
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:30,734
<i>Sherry, is that you?</i>

56
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:34,801
Yeah, what's up?

57
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:38,334
<i>Listen, I got</i>
<i>to wrap it up.</i>

58
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:39,334
Want a cigarette?

59
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:42,601
Yeah, okay, um...

60
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:44,634
that's cool.

61
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,434
Tell everybody
I said hi.

62
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:47,701
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

63
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:49,334
Kiss my baby for me.

64
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:51,968
Kiss Lexi for me.
Tell her I'm coming.

65
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:54,701
What time are you
coming tomorrow?

66
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,968
<i>After lunch.</i>
<i>Listen, I got to run.</i>

67
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:59,234
Cool, peace.

68
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,868
<i>Blanquita.</i>

69
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:02,234
<i>Blanquita,</i>

70
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:04,400
you think you're
too good for us?

71
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,133
<i>Destiny, chill out.</i>

72
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:08,567
<i>The girl just got</i>
<i>her release.</i>

73
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,100
<i>Parole office.</i>

74
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:22,300
Could I talk to PO Hernandez?

75
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,934
<i>Who's calling?</i>

76
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,167
Swanson.

77
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:26,300
<i>Parole number?</i>

78
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,968
95-G4-620.

79
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,267
No crossing state lines without
permission from this office.

80
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,267
Any change in residence

81
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:37,701
must be reported
in writing.

82
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:39,033
Do you understand
the conditions

83
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:40,734
of your parole,
Ms. Swanson?

84
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,234
Mm-hmm.

85
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,601
Here's the rest
of your commissary.

86
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:49,234
Count it out
in front of me.

87
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:50,567
Sign the receipt.

88
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:52,501
Make sure it's
all there.

89
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:06,133
On each and every
reporting day,

90
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,801
you will submit
your pay stubs

91
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,934
along with this form.

92
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:13,000
Make sure the form
is filled out correctly.

93
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:15,033
Can I smoke in here?

94
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,033
Get a job as soon
as possible.

95
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:19,934
Otherwise, I have to see you
three times a week,

96
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:23,367
and, frankly, I don't have
the time for that right now.

97
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:44,300
Could I ask you
about something now, or...

98
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:50,400
Um, this--this
curfew thing?

99
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:52,167
<i>I just, um--</i>

100
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:55,300
<i>I would like to spend the night</i>
<i>at my family's house,</i>

101
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:56,300
<i>at my brother's house.</i>

102
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:58,968
I haven't seen them
for a long time.

103
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:02,334
I thought you had
no problems, Swanson.

104
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:03,734
Yeah.

105
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:06,367
Any unreported police contact

106
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:08,534
will result in the immediate
violation of your parole,

107
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:09,734
and I will violate you.

108
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:11,334
You will be returned
to prison

109
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:12,934
to serve the remainder
of your sentence,

110
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:14,901
plus any new charges
you may incur.

111
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:17,300
Monday at 9:00 a. m. ,
you report to Mr. Monroe

112
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:20,234
at 1138 Clifford Street.

113
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:22,000
Please give me a pass.

114
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,667
Are you trying to fuck
with me, Swanson?

115
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:30,033
Or are you here to successfully
complete your parole?

116
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:33,400
To successfully complete
my parole, sir.

117
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:37,033
<i>I just really--</i>

118
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:39,167
I have to see my daughter.

119
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,567
I haven't seen her
in a long time.

120
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:59,801
Your brother's name
and address, what is it?

121
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:01,667
Robert Swanson.

122
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,868
<i>1334 Ridge Drive.</i>

123
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:05,801
Slow down.

124
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:08,901
One...

125
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:12,501
334 Ridge Drive.

126
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:17,701
Mountainside,
New Jersey.

127
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,300
<i>Come on, there's nothing</i>
<i>to see here.</i>

128
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:31,701
<i>Come on, keep moving.</i>
<i>Keep moving.</i>

129
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:32,634
Let's go.
Let's go.

130
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,501
Dump it.

131
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:52,367
Yo, bitch, why do you--
I told you,

132
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:55,200
I ain't coming
up off that rock for free.

133
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:51,968
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

134
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:53,033
Good luck tomorrow,
okay?

135
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:54,033
<i>Thanks, Andy.</i>

136
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:56,367
<i>Thanks for helping</i>
<i>me out.</i>

137
00:10:56,368 --> 00:10:57,367
How do you do?

138
00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:59,868
Hey.

139
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,367
I'm Andy Kelly.

140
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:02,934
I'm the director
of this program.

141
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:03,934
Oh, hey, I'm Sherry.

142
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:04,968
I just got here.

143
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:06,367
Nice to meet you--
Sherry Swanson.

144
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:07,367
Yeah.

145
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:08,667
Right, I processed
your intake.

146
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,667
Oh.

147
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,234
Welcome to Genesis House.

148
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:12,634
Thanks.

149
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:15,434
Is that your Bible?

150
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:17,100
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, it is.

151
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:18,667
Well, you know what
you should do?

152
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:20,434
Take a look at this one.

153
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:22,634
What's laid out in the first
164 pages of this book

154
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,167
gram for life.

155
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:26,367
It's a program of change
that'll spin your head around

156
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:27,901
and make you happier
than you ever were

157
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:29,300
when you were on drugs
and alcohol.

158
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:30,400
I know all about it.

159
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:32,567
I did a year of 12-step
when I was locked up.

160
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,601
Really?

161
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:38,334
I, um... I like
the Good Book better.

162
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,467
Gotcha.

163
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,167
Do you want some coffee?

164
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:47,567
Yeah.

165
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:50,534
<i>Please.</i>

166
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,567
Oh.
Oh, stop.

167
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:10,934
Stop, stop.

168
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:14,067
Damn.

169
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,067
I could go all night.

170
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:22,767
Look at this.

171
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,501
My friend shaved it.

172
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:30,434
You want to kiss it?

173
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,667
Come on, baby.

174
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,667
Come on, kiss it.

175
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:34,767
Okay.

176
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:02,100
You have
a visitor.

177
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:03,200
Okay.

178
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:31,200
Oh, shit.

179
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,133
Put some meat
on your bones.

180
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:38,601
Yeah.

181
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:40,868
I missed you.

182
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:43,300
You should have
come see me.

183
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,801
Okay, let's get
the fuck out of here.

184
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,334
It's all pretty much the same.

185
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:57,601
The only thing different
is we got a new table.

186
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:03,234
Well, I guess Lynette
redecorated the living room.

187
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:05,133
We got Alexis a new bed.

188
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:08,334
She didn't want to get rid
of her little baby bed.

189
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:12,767
But you'll see;
everything's the same.

190
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,701
It'll be like
you never left.

191
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,901
<i>Did you hear</i>
<i>Chris Cuzar died?</i>

192
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:27,067
How am I supposed
to hear that?

193
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:29,801
I don't know
who you talk to.

194
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,534
Nobody.

195
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:37,300
I don't talk
to nobody, Bob.

196
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,801
How'd he die,
from the dope?

197
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:41,234
Yep.

198
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,367
Shit, do you have
a cigarette?

199
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:50,801
Nope, I quit.

200
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,667
Fuck you.

201
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:57,501
Look at the little mermaid.

202
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:59,067
Don't go too far.

203
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:00,634
Come back here.

204
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:02,133
Get over here.

205
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,901


206
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,767
<i>Munchkin.</i>

207
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:07,200
Hey, girls.

208
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:08,467
Hey, hon.

209
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:09,467
<i>Lynnie.</i>

210
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:12,000
<i>Hi, Sherry.</i>

211
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:15,400
Welcome home.

212
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:20,934
Hi.

213
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:22,801
<i>You're here,</i>
<i>wow.</i>

214
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,334
Not going to hug you--
I'm wet.

215
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,834
You remember Sherry,
Lexi?

216
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Mommy?

217
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,634
Hi.

218
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:44,734
I'm going
to clean the pool.

219
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,734
It's dirty.

220
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:46,734
Hey, baby.

221
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:48,200
Oh, you want
to hug me?

222
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,801
Yeah?

223
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:52,667
Oh, baby.

224
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:55,367
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

225
00:15:55,368 --> 00:16:01,067
Oh, Lexi,
I'm so sorry.

226
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:03,267
I'm so sorry, baby.

227
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:11,434
I missed you
so much.

228
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,334
Where were you?

229
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:34,634
<i>Mommy, Mommy,</i>

230
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:35,634
Mommy, Mommy.

231
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:38,133
Damn, girl,
you got heavy.

232
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,000
Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy.

233
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,534
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

234
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:48,067
Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy.

235
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:51,267
Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy.

236
00:16:51,268 --> 00:16:53,567
Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy.

237
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:55,534
Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy.

238
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:57,100
Don't jump on the couch,
sweetie.

239
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,133
Sit down, baby.

240
00:16:58,134 --> 00:16:59,567
Let me put on
your robe.

241
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:01,701
Arm.

242
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:04,334
You want to see
your presents, baby?

243
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:05,767
What are you doing,
silly goose?

244
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:07,901
<i>Okay, look at this one.</i>

245
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,033
Look at that.

246
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:12,601
I picked that
for you.

247
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:14,667
Eeee.

248
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,834
I like that.

249
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,667
I think that's cute.

250
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,734
Okay, look at that.

251
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,100
I already got
that stuff.

252
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:24,334
You do?

253
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,901
Okay, whatever.

254
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:27,400
<i>A Barbie.</i>

255
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,300
Yeah, you like Barbie?

256
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:30,601
She's so pretty.

257
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:32,067
You do?

258
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,934
Oh, can I kiss her too?

259
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:39,400
smooch!

260
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:42,334
<i>Okay, now this present</i>
<i>is the most special one,</i>

261
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:44,667
that's behind
my back.

262
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:47,434
This one is from
my best friend.

263
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:49,167
<i>She made it.</i>

264
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,434
<i>She made it all</i>
<i>by herself for you.</i>

265
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:54,200
Red, red, red.

266
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:57,300
Ohh.

267
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:58,367
I like it.

268
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,601
You like it?

269
00:17:59,602 --> 00:18:01,467
Uh-huh.

270
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:02,534
You do?

271
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:03,801
Uh-huh.

272
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:05,834
Oh, I love you,
Lexi.

273
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,000
You want Mommy to tell you
the story now

274
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,767
of what happened
to me?

275
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:12,767
Mm-hmm.

276
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:13,868
Yeah?

277
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:19,200
Look, honey,
come here.

278
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:21,434
I want to tell you
the truth, okay?

279
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,434
Okay?

280
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:26,200
And sometimes
it's not easy

281
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:28,334
to tell the truth;
you know what I mean?

282
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:30,133
Mm-hmm.

283
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:34,100
I did a bad thing,
and they sent me to jail.

284
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:36,067
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what that is?</i>

285
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:42,868
<i>What bad thing?</i>

286
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:49,968
I stole from people
to get money for drugs.

287
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:51,400
Mm-hmm.

288
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:52,567
Oh, baby,
come here.

289
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:59,200
Oh, honey, I missed you
so, so, so, so much.

290
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:02,534
I used to talk to you.

291
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:03,968
Did you hear me?

292
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:05,701
Mm-mm.

293
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:08,367
No?

294
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,701
Lord, please, please, please,

295
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:21,067
please, please
hear my extra prayer tonight.

296
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:23,467
y weaknesses
and my mistakes.

297
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:25,367
Give me the strength
to take life one day at a time

298
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:27,300
and take care
of my daughter again, amen.

299
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,133
Three years in Clinton, huh?

300
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:52,801
Well, there's the Del Monte
plant in Irvington,

301
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:55,100
just started hiring
new people.

302
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:57,534
Actually, I would like
to work with kids.

303
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:58,868
Kids?

304
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:03,033
Yes, I graduated the Parenting
From the Inside program,

305
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:06,300
and I worked 13 months

306
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:10,734
<i>in the family trailers</i>
<i>and 6 in the children's center.</i>

307
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:16,100
So I'd like to work
in a Head Start

308
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:17,901
or a day care
or something like that.

309
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:18,934
Uh-huh.

310
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:26,067
<i>Also, I have a child.</i>

311
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:30,367
Swanson, you're a young,
pretty girl.

312
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:31,367
If you don't want to work

313
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:32,767
<i>in the factory,</i>

314
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:36,567
<i>you know, maybe you could</i>
<i>wait tables, cocktail--</i>

315
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,567
<i>oh, no, no, no, no,</i>

316
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:41,200
not--not with...

317
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:44,467
<i>Hmm.</i>

318
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:47,634
Wait, I, um...

319
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,067
I have some papers.

320
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:03,033
This is from
the parenting program.

321
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:05,200
Okay.

322
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,734
This one is from
the children's center.

323
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:08,834
Okay.

324
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,000
And...

325
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:13,133
And... and what?

326
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:29,968
Nice.

327
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:33,801
I'll suck your dick
if you give me the job I want.

328
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,434
The fuck you
looking at?

329
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:12,868


330
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:22,200
God, grant me the serenity

331
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:28,100
to accept things
I cannot change,

332
00:22:28,101 --> 00:22:30,133
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

333
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:33,200
Tonight Dean will be reading
the preamble.

334
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:34,501
My name's Dean.

335
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:36,400
I'm an alcoholic
and an addict.

336
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:37,834
<i>Hi, Dean.</i>

337
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:39,000
Genesis Recovery

338
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,801
<i>is a fellowship</i>
<i>of men and women</i>

339
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:42,634
o share their experience,

340
00:22:42,635 --> 00:22:44,067
strength, and hope
with each other,

341
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:46,267
that they may solve
their common problem

342
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:49,133
<i>and help others to recover</i>

343
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,601
from alcoholism
and drug addiction.

344
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:51,467
Is there anyone here tonight

345
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:53,734
that feels the need
to drink or use?

346
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:56,567
Go ahead, little sister.

347
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:59,367
<i>Don't be shy.</i>

348
00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:05,133
Um, I'm Sherry.
I'm an addict.

349
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,701
Hi, Sherry.

350
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,801
Um, I've got
2 1/2 years clean.

351
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:19,434
I got clean in prison,

352
00:23:19,435 --> 00:23:21,467
and...

353
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:24,934
I feel like using so bad.

354
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:33,934
From the age of 16 to 22,
heroin was the love of my life.

355
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,868
I mean, I had a daughter,

356
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:44,334
and I never even
took care of her,

357
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:50,400
and I want
to take care of her,

358
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:54,601
but I got to...

359
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:58,367
stay clean,
so I'm just here

360
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:00,968
to stay clean and...

361
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,868
That's all I got.

362
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,167
Hey, Sherry.

363
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:21,400
Hey.

364
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:24,934
Listen, don't worry
about your problems.

365
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:27,968
I mean,
you're not alone.

366
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,467
Like, me, I could
completely relate

367
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,667
to what you
were saying,

368
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:32,133
because I come
from a dysfunctional,

369
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:33,567
alcoholic family.

370
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:37,701
And drugs were part
of my entire teenage life.

371
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:38,968
When I was growing up,

372
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:41,267
I knew we weren't supposed
to be doing drugs,

373
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:42,834
but everyone
was doing them anyway,

374
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:46,133
so I just--
I just fell into that, you know?

375
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:48,634
She's not hearing you,
friend.

376
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:52,167
She's got too much
on her mind.

377
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:55,534
Do you need
a ride home?

378
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,767
Okay, thanks.

379
00:24:57,768 --> 00:24:59,467
He's right, Andy.
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,200
I'll catch up with you
tomorrow.

381
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,467
Sherry, did you ever

382
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:24,634
<i>work at Tony Martino's joint,</i>
<i>the Paradise?</i>

383
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:26,267
I used to cook speed

384
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:28,367
in a warehouse
over at South Kearny.

385
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:31,367
<i>Tony was</i>
<i>one of my partners.</i>

386
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:33,400
What's your name again?

387
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:34,734
Dean Walker.

388
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:37,334
Dean Walker?

389
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,167
I don't know you.

390
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:44,801
Man, I was, like, 16
when I worked there, I think.

391
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:46,934
<i>Tony named me Lolita.</i>

392
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:49,467
That was my stage name
because I was so young, Lolita.

393
00:25:49,468 --> 00:25:51,200
<i>I had really long hair.</i>

394
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,367
Yeah, I remember.

395
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:53,567
<i>You do?</i>

396
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:55,200
You know
they closed that place down.

397
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:56,200
<i>Why,</i>

398
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:57,634
too many underage girls?

399
00:25:57,635 --> 00:25:58,634


400
00:25:58,635 --> 00:25:59,634
<i>No,</i>

401
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:00,734
it all came down

402
00:26:00,735 --> 00:26:02,067
when Richardson
got into office.

403
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:03,167
Tony lost all his juice.

404
00:26:03,168 --> 00:26:06,434
Where's he at, anyways?

405
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:07,834
<i>Greenhaven.</i>

406
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:10,667
He got busted making a big move
in the city last year.

407
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:12,300
They gave him 15 to life.

408
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:15,868
15 to life.

409
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:18,934
Damn, that's deep.

410
00:26:18,935 --> 00:26:21,267
<i>He probably deserved it,</i>
<i>though, right?</i>

411
00:26:21,268 --> 00:26:22,400
Ugh!

412
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,334
Do you know Richie Parks?

413
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:25,534
Richie Parks.

414
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:27,234
No, I don't know him.
Who's that?

415
00:26:27,235 --> 00:26:29,734
He's another lowlife scumbag.

416
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:31,934
He's also my baby's daddy.

417
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:34,734
He broke out a while ago.

418
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:37,567
I don't know
if he's alive or dead.

419
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:39,033
Do you have kids?

420
00:26:39,034 --> 00:26:40,067
Oh, yeah.

421
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:41,767
I got three boys
and two girls.

422
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,601
They all live in Oklahoma
with their mamas.

423
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,901
Hmm.

424
00:26:45,902 --> 00:26:47,033
Do you take care of them?

425
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:49,567
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>I do now.</i>

426
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,434
So far away.

427
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah.

428
00:26:57,934 --> 00:26:59,133
Okay, thanks, man.

429
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:00,634
Good night, little sister.

430
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:01,968
And you take care,
all right?

431
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:03,634
And be careful.

432
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:05,567
Bye.

433
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,467
I love you too.

434
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:21,601
All right.

435
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:23,534
Okay, bye.

436
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:29,033
What's up?

437
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:31,367
Some fucking real-life bullshit
I had to deal with today.

438
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:32,534
Are you done
with the phone?

439
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:34,133
Yeah, go ahead.

440
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:37,067
I forgot how it gets,
you know.

441
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:40,200
Here I was,
thinking prison was the worst;

442
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,968
this was gonna be, like,
some kind of heaven,

443
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:43,400
but it ain't, you know?

444
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:46,267
I heard that.

445
00:27:46,268 --> 00:27:49,934
That job shit
got me tight.

446
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:54,334
You all right?

447
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:05,033
Good looking out,
girl.

448
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:08,000
Ain't no thing.

449
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:10,267
What are you looking at?

450
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:16,334
<i>Damn, white girl,</i>
<i>you are always on the phone.</i>

451
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:19,300
¿Estás sorda?

452
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:21,200
Hey, Lynette.
Hi.

453
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,000
How are you?
It's Sherry.

454
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,534
Is Bobby there?

455
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:27,467
Don't you hear me?

456
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:31,934
Ah--
hey, Bobby, what's up?

457
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:34,133
It's Sherry, yeah.

458
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:36,934
How you doing?

459
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:39,467
Yeah?

460
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,067
Cool. Listen, I called
to talk to Alexis, actually.

461
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,167
Is she there?

462
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:45,000
Why, you think
you're something special?

463
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:46,567
What? She's sleeping?

464
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:47,734
Wait.
Hold on a second.

465
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:49,801
Get out of my face.

466
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:50,901
Bitch.

467
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:53,434
Uh...

468
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:55,534
Okay, well,

469
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:57,901
I'm gonna call back tomorrow,
then, early,

470
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,033
because I really want
to talk to her, okay?

471
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:07,200
Okay.

472
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:09,133
Okay, Bobby.
Bye.

473
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:17,267


474
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,234
Have you got a problem
with me?

475
00:29:22,235 --> 00:29:25,200
Yeah, I've got
a problem with you, bitch.

476
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,701
You jealous of me
or something?

477
00:29:26,702 --> 00:29:29,100
Your mother's a bitch.

478
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,367
Oh, my mother's a bitch?

479
00:29:31,368 --> 00:29:35,834
My mother's dead,
you fucking stupid crackhead.

480
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:37,200
But you turned out good.

481
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:38,767
Look at you.

482
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:40,434
Your daddy's
a fucking baby raper.

483
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:42,067
Get the--

484
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:44,400
Fuck you,
you fucking cunt!

485
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,434
I'll call the cops!

486
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:48,033
Do you hear me?

487
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:50,300
Fuck you,
you fucking toothless cunt!

488
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:51,834
Fuck you, <i>puta!</i>

489
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:53,234
Now that you've
both been fucked,

490
00:29:53,235 --> 00:29:54,534
you should feel better.

491
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:55,734
I'm telling you, bitch,

492
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:57,567
you don't fuck with me,
because I will hurt you.

493
00:29:57,568 --> 00:29:59,400
Go to your rooms, now,

494
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:01,067
or I'm calling 911.

495
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:02,100
Go.

496
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:13,734
Sherry, wake up.

497
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:18,634
Oh.

498
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:20,567
What's going on?

499
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,767
Sorry.

500
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:36,901
Sorry to show up like this.

501
00:31:36,902 --> 00:31:39,000
Bob.

502
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:40,067
<i>Yes, hon?</i>

503
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:44,167
Your sister's here.

504
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:47,167
<i>Hey.</i>

505
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:48,467
<i>Hey.</i>

506
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:49,834
What are you
doing here?

507
00:31:49,835 --> 00:31:51,133
Mommy!

508
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:53,167
Hey.
Oh.

509
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:54,834
<i>Hey, Lexi.</i>

510
00:31:54,835 --> 00:31:58,734
<i>How you doing, kiddo?</i>

511
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:03,667
Why do you have
a garbage bag?

512
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:04,968
<i>A garbage bag?</i>

513
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:07,701
Okay, come on.

514
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:09,434
Let's finish getting ready
for camp.

515
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:24,667
I can't stay at that place.

516
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:27,200
<i>It's like being in prison</i>
<i>all over again.</i>

517
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:29,701
I know. I know.
I hear you.

518
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:32,167
Mm.

519
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:34,100
<i>But don't you</i>
<i>have to stay there?</i>

520
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:35,234
No.

521
00:32:35,235 --> 00:32:36,834
<i>I can live</i>
<i>wherever I want.</i>

522
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:37,901
<i>I just have a curfew.</i>

523
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:39,334
You take sugar?

524
00:32:39,335 --> 00:32:42,734
No.

525
00:32:42,735 --> 00:32:44,400
Milk?

526
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:46,334
No, thanks.

527
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,634
So, Bobby,

528
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:55,234
<i>I'm not asking</i>
<i>to move in here.</i>

529
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:56,767
Okay?

530
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:59,534
But I do need to stay here
for a little while.

531
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:02,667
<i>Two weeks.</i>

532
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:05,767
If I stay at that place,

533
00:33:05,768 --> 00:33:08,200
I'm gonna violate.

534
00:33:08,201 --> 00:33:09,767
I can feel it.

535
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:14,834
Okay.

536
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:18,701
Okay.

537
00:33:18,702 --> 00:33:21,834
No drugs in this house,
Sherry.

538
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:24,033
You bring drugs in here,
and I'm going to call the cops.

539
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:25,167
<i>Bobby,</i>

540
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:28,534
how many times
do I got to tell you this?

541
00:33:28,535 --> 00:33:30,634
I'm clean.

542
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,300
<i>Okay.</i>

543
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,701
Promise?

544
00:33:33,702 --> 00:33:35,868
<i>Hey, my baby.</i>

545
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:40,300
I'm going to camp now,
Sherry.

546
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,701
"Sherry"?

547
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:49,801
You want to give your mama
a kiss?

548
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:51,601
I think you do.

549
00:33:51,602 --> 00:33:52,601
<i>Alexis.</i>

550
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:54,133
An Eskimo kiss?

551
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:55,801
<i>You're gonna be late</i>
<i>for camp.</i>

552
00:33:55,802 --> 00:33:57,400
<i>You remember</i>
<i>what that one is?</i>

553
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:58,334
smooch!

554
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:01,367
You have a good day,
baby.

555
00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:02,367
Mm-hm.
Okay.

556
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,067
Bye, Alexis.

557
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:06,634
Have a good day,
okay?

558
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:07,667
Bye, baby.

559
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:09,133
Oh, yeah,
here's your lunch.

560
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:11,067
Bye, Sherry.

561
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,033
What the fuck was that?

562
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:19,033
What?

563
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:21,567
She just called me Sherry.

564
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:26,801
Yeah.

565
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:29,067
Me and Lynette were trying
to talk to you about that

566
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:31,434
<i>the last time</i>
<i>you were here.</i>

567
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:33,267
You want to help me
with these boxes?

568
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:34,801
<i>Yeah, babe.</i>

569
00:34:40,868 --> 00:34:42,000
I'll be right back.

570
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,934
Oh, yeah,
whatever.

571
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:55,067
I'm her--
I'm her fucking mother.

572
00:35:55,968 --> 00:35:58,901


573
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:16,601
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

574
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:45,033
You want one?

575
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:46,200
Sure.

576
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,133
Thanks.

577
00:36:58,434 --> 00:37:02,601
You don't think these pants
are too tight, do you?

578
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:04,367
Turn around.
Let me see you.

579
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,834
No, you got a good figure.

580
00:37:10,835 --> 00:37:12,100
You look cute.

581
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:21,234
You think Lexi's
gonna get my body?

582
00:37:21,235 --> 00:37:22,234
I don't know.

583
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:24,567
<i>I do.</i>

584
00:37:24,568 --> 00:37:28,567
That girl is going to be
tall and skinny.

585
00:37:28,568 --> 00:37:32,033
Watch.

586
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:33,934
I'm gonna look out
for her.

587
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:38,534
Want me to do your makeup
later?

588
00:37:40,868 --> 00:37:43,400
Would you?

589
00:37:43,401 --> 00:37:45,534
Sure.

590
00:37:45,535 --> 00:37:48,534
Just let me
finish this first.

591
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:53,501
I'm going to do your eyes purple
to match your pants, okay?

592
00:37:53,502 --> 00:37:55,300
And I'll give it to you
when I'm done,

593
00:37:55,301 --> 00:37:57,400
so you can have it.

594
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:08,267
I never got a professional
makeup job before.

595
00:38:08,268 --> 00:38:09,467
Thank you.

596
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,467
You know, every Friday night
in my cell,

597
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:18,734
we'd have ladies' night.

598
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:21,033
We'd put on face masks
and wear lingerie

599
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:22,634
and stuff like that.

600
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,968
Lingerie in jail.

601
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:29,367
You're really nuts.

602
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:30,501
That's what happens

603
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:32,467
when you got to wear
state clothes every day.

604
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:37,834
You didn't go with any girls,
did you?

605
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:44,601
No.

606
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:46,868
Some girls in there
tried to get with me,

607
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:50,467
but I told them
what time it was.

608
00:39:01,434 --> 00:39:04,067
Daddy.

609
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:06,934
Sherry Anne.

610
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:08,033
What's that?

611
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:09,834
Hi.
How are you?

612
00:39:09,835 --> 00:39:11,167
Well, we got
into some traffic.

613
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:12,467
Hey, Marcia.

614
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:13,968
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i>
Good.

615
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:15,434
<i>Don't cry.</i>
<i>You'll make me cry.</i>

616
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,601
Oh.

617
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:21,934
Come on, stop it.

618
00:39:21,935 --> 00:39:24,567
It's okay.

619
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:26,968
We should have taken 22,
and...

620
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:29,133
I missed you so much.

621
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:31,534
I missed you too.

622
00:39:33,033 --> 00:39:35,400
Come on,
say hi to my wife.

623
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:36,434
Look at my makeup.

624
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:37,868
It's real pretty.

625
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:39,367
<i>Yeah, we took 78, and--</i>

626
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:40,734
Remember Marcia?

627
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:41,868
Hi.
Hi.

628
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,300
Bob.

629
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:45,501
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

630
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:47,534
You really got to clean out
those gutters, you know?

631
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:49,067
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>yeah, I know.</i>

632
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:54,901
This ought
to help you out.

633
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:55,968
You know, Dad,

634
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:59,801
<i>you don't</i>
<i>have to give me money.</i>

635
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:01,968
<i>Grandpa's here.</i>

636
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:02,968
Oh, there she is.

637
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:04,200
Oh, Lexi.

638
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,100
There's my precious
little girl.

639
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:08,434
Here, honey.
This is for you.

640
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:09,801
Can I just
fix this?

641
00:40:09,802 --> 00:40:11,100
Dad.

642
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:12,133
Oh, this is hot.

643
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:13,400
Attagirl.

644
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:15,968
Look at you and Grandpa.

645
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:17,300
What do you say, Alexis?

646
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:18,300
Thank you, Grandma.

647
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:19,400
<i>You're welcome.</i>

648
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:20,434
Hey, Dad.

649
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:21,901
Hey, Dad.

650
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:24,000
Dad, look at how much
we look alike

651
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:26,000
now that she's
got bigger.

652
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:27,000
Look at that.

653
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:28,934
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

654
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,033
What do you got there?

655
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:31,300
Dad.

656
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:34,434
Dad, there's a--
I want to show you something.

657
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:35,834
<i>Daddy.</i>

658
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:36,868
Come on.

659
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:38,033
I want to show you
something.

660
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:39,601
Come on.
Let's go see what Sherry wants.

661
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:40,601
<i>I got my GED.</i>

662
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:41,601
Okeydoke.

663
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:42,734
<i>Okeydoke.</i>

664
00:40:42,735 --> 00:40:45,868
<i>I want to show you.</i>

665
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:48,901
I want to welcome home
my baby,

666
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:51,033
Sherry Anne.

667
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:53,367
Welcome home,
Sher.

668
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:56,701
Cheers. Cheers.

669
00:40:56,702 --> 00:40:57,634
Cheers.

670
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:00,367
<i>I want soda.</i>

671
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,701
Milk first.

672
00:41:02,702 --> 00:41:05,000
<i>Then you'll get</i>
<i>your soda.</i>

673
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:08,501
Hey, Lynnie,
this sure looks good.

674
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:11,968
Did you help with this?

675
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:12,968
No.

676
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,701
So how's the Caddy
holding up, Dad?

677
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:20,234
Eat your burger first.

678
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:21,901
<i>It's the perfect piece</i>
<i>of machinery.</i>

679
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:23,634
<i>You know, you've had</i>
<i>that car so long,</i>

680
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:24,734
<i>I don't think it's safe</i>
<i>for you</i>

681
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:25,968
to drive it down to Florida
this year.

682
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:27,167
<i>I don't think so either.</i>

683
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:28,234
<i>You need a new car,</i>
<i>Dad.</i>

684
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,234
Now?

685
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:30,367
Okay.

686
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,033
I swear, she's hooked
on the Disney Channel.

687
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:34,033


688
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,367
<i>Did you see that email</i>

689
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,367
Marty sent around?

690
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,467
Bobby, that's disgusting.

691
00:41:37,468 --> 00:41:39,300
We're eating here.

692
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:41,634
<i>They're going to start charging</i>
<i>for emails, you know.</i>

693
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:43,601
<i>Alexis, come eat</i>
<i>more of your burger.</i>

694
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,467
<i>That's what I keep saying,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

695
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:47,567
<i>That Marty,</i>
<i>he's a real piece of work.</i>

696
00:41:47,568 --> 00:41:49,100
I don't know
where he finds that stuff,

697
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:51,834
but he does.

698
00:41:51,835 --> 00:41:54,801
<i>Come on, pass me</i>
<i>that potato salad.</i>

699
00:41:54,802 --> 00:41:56,767
<i>There you go.</i>

700
00:41:56,768 --> 00:41:58,901
<i>I don't want to waste room</i>
<i>on salad.</i>

701
00:41:58,902 --> 00:42:01,868
Yeah?

702
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:02,968
You do?

703
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:04,300
<i>Yeah.</i>

704
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:07,133
Okay, Alexis wants
to hear me sing for you all.

705
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:08,801
Spare us, Sher.

706
00:42:08,802 --> 00:42:10,400
We don't want to break
any glasses.

707
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:16,133
<i>Alexis.</i>

708
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:20,434
<i>* Close your eyes. *</i>

709
00:42:20,435 --> 00:42:23,701

* darling. *

711
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:31,200
* Do you feel
my heart beating? *

712
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:33,267
<i>* Do you understand? *</i>

713
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:35,634
<i>* Do you feel *</i>

714
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:38,100
* the same, *

715
00:42:38,101 --> 00:42:41,133
* or am I only *

716
00:42:41,134 --> 00:42:44,067
<i>* dreaming? *</i>

717
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:46,167
<i>* Or is *</i>

718
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:54,033
his burning
an eternal flame? *

719
00:42:54,034 --> 00:42:56,701
<i>* I believe *</i>

720
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:59,801
<i>* we're meant to be, *</i>

721
00:42:59,802 --> 00:43:01,033
<i>* darling. *</i>

722
00:43:01,034 --> 00:43:06,634
* I watched you
when you were sleeping. *

723
00:43:06,635 --> 00:43:09,801
* You belong with me. *

724
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:13,801
<i>* Do you feel the same, *</i>

725
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:19,901
<i>* or am I only dreaming? *</i>

726
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:22,467
<i>* Or is *</i>

727
00:43:22,468 --> 00:43:29,934
* this burning
an eternal flame? *

728
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:35,133
That was good, Sher.

729
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:36,934
Should have gone
on<i>American Idol.</i>

730
00:43:36,935 --> 00:43:38,133
You'd probably win.

731
00:43:38,134 --> 00:43:40,834
Don't be a wise guy.

732
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:41,834
Sherry's a good singer.

733
00:43:41,835 --> 00:43:43,567
<i>Beautiful, baby.</i>

734
00:43:43,568 --> 00:43:46,634
Okay, I'm going to get
some more wine.

735
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,267
<i>Come on, baby bear.</i>

736
00:43:51,268 --> 00:43:52,400
<i>I'm putting him in.</i>

737
00:43:52,401 --> 00:43:53,667
<i>I'm putting him in.</i>

738
00:43:53,668 --> 00:43:57,701
I think this looks good
like that.

739
00:43:57,702 --> 00:43:59,267
Can I come in yet?

740
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:00,901
<i>Nope.</i>

741
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:03,300
Is that good?

742
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:05,334
<i>Yeah, that's good.</i>

743
00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:08,000
<i>This can be your baby.</i>

744
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:10,200
And this can be mine.

745
00:44:10,201 --> 00:44:11,968
What's your baby's name?

746
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:15,501
My baby...

747
00:44:15,502 --> 00:44:16,667
um...

748
00:44:16,668 --> 00:44:19,400
my baby is named Alexis.

749
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:20,868
No!

750
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:22,634
What do you mean, "no"?

751
00:44:22,635 --> 00:44:25,634
This is pretend,

752
00:44:25,635 --> 00:44:28,968
and you have to pick
a new name.

753
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,834
Why?

754
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,200
Because.

755
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:36,501
But Alexis
is my favorite name.

756
00:44:36,502 --> 00:44:37,767
No.

757
00:44:37,768 --> 00:44:39,934
Besides, there could be
two Alexises.

758
00:44:39,935 --> 00:44:42,334
Well, okay.

759
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:43,734
You can call her that,

760
00:44:43,735 --> 00:44:46,767
but then my baby's name
can be Sherry.

761
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,934
Two Alexises
and two Sherrys.

762
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:51,167
Two Alexises...

763
00:44:51,168 --> 00:44:53,200
And two Sherrys.

764
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,701
Ah!

765
00:44:58,702 --> 00:44:59,701
Mm-mm.

766
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:01,434
In the fort,
in here.

767
00:45:01,435 --> 00:45:02,434
Let's go.

768
00:45:02,435 --> 00:45:03,434
Okay.

769
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:07,667
Should I take
this Sherry?

770
00:45:08,968 --> 00:45:12,701
Lynnie told me to call you
Sherry, not Mommy.

771
00:45:12,702 --> 00:45:14,234


772
00:45:14,235 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah, I figured.

773
00:45:19,001 --> 00:45:20,534
Squeak, squeak, squeak.

774
00:45:20,535 --> 00:45:22,000
When you come
and live with me,

775
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:23,901
<i>you can call me Momm</i>

776
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:26,300
Alexis, Grandma Mary's here
to see you.

777
00:45:26,301 --> 00:45:27,534
<i>Grandma Mary.</i>

778
00:45:27,535 --> 00:45:30,167
No, baby.

779
00:45:30,168 --> 00:45:31,601
<i>She's waiting.</i>

780
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:35,868
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

781
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:37,434
<i>Hi, Grandma.</i>

782
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:41,434
You are confusing her
with this Sherry bullshit.

783
00:45:41,435 --> 00:45:43,434
I'm confusing her?

784
00:45:43,435 --> 00:45:44,934
I don't think so.

785
00:45:44,935 --> 00:45:46,467
She was fine
until you showed up again.

786
00:45:46,468 --> 00:45:47,767
I'm her mother.

787
00:45:47,768 --> 00:45:48,767
Well, act like one.

788
00:45:48,768 --> 00:45:50,167
What, are you
fucking jealous?

789
00:45:50,168 --> 00:45:52,167
You want to--you're gonna
curse in front of her?

790
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:53,667
You want to see
my stretch marks, Lyn?

791
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:55,000
<i>Don't be disgusting.</i>

792
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:58,067
Check this out.
You want to check this out?

793
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,901
It's just too many people
in a house.

794
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:37,501
I told you, you can't just keep
sleeping on the floor like that.

795
00:46:37,502 --> 00:46:39,834
You should be on my side.

796
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,734
<i>Here, you need some cash?</i>

797
00:46:48,735 --> 00:46:52,000
Daddy, gave me
some cash.

798
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:55,567
Sherry, here.

799
00:46:55,568 --> 00:46:58,934
I'm your fucking sister.

800
00:46:58,935 --> 00:47:00,400
Shit!

801
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:05,667
I'll just wait out here,
make sure you get a room.

802
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,801
Dean, hey, it's Sherry,

803
00:47:22,802 --> 00:47:24,634
Tony Martino's girl.

804
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:25,667
Yeah.

805
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:31,000
Yeah, I met you
at Genesis Recovery, remember?

806
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:33,834
I was just, um...

807
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:37,167
uh...

808
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,334
Well, I was just calling
because I was--

809
00:47:44,335 --> 00:47:51,267
I was...

810
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,501
I was wondering if, um--

811
00:47:53,502 --> 00:47:55,601
what you were doing.

812
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,234
<i>Who's there?</i>

813
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:14,167
<i>Dean.</i>

814
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:27,234
Greetings.

815
00:48:27,235 --> 00:48:30,167
Damn, you got here late.

816
00:48:38,234 --> 00:48:40,200
Oh, no.

817
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:52,467
Damn.

818
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,234
<i>You like my hair?</i>

819
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,968
Yeah, it ain't bad.

820
00:49:16,968 --> 00:49:20,400
Ooh, look at that.

821
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:22,000
Mm-hmm.

822
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,734
Mmm.

823
00:49:23,735 --> 00:49:27,234
Looking good,
little Lolita.

824
00:49:27,235 --> 00:49:31,100
Don't call me that.

825
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:37,434
You got to stop
drinking that poison.

826
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:58,667
Did you ever
see me dance?

827
00:49:58,668 --> 00:50:00,968
Oh, yeah.

828
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,200
Are you going to dance
for me tonight?

829
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:04,200
No.

830
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:09,200
I gave that shit up.

831
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:12,734
Good little girl.

832
00:50:12,735 --> 00:50:17,767
Doesn't dance
for anybody anymore.

833
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,234
You had any police contact
this weekend, Swanson?

834
00:50:54,235 --> 00:50:56,067
No, but I called--
On the wall!

835
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:57,334
Get your hands
on the wall now!

836
00:50:57,335 --> 00:50:59,033
I told you I was going
to my brother's house.

837
00:50:59,034 --> 00:51:00,701
I called you. I left you a--
you didn't get my message?

838
00:51:00,702 --> 00:51:01,701
Shut up!

839
00:51:01,702 --> 00:51:02,701
What the fuck?

840
00:51:02,702 --> 00:51:03,801
You can stay
where you want,

841
00:51:03,802 --> 00:51:05,801
but you will go through
the proper channels.

842
00:51:05,802 --> 00:51:07,501
Spread 'em.
Kick your shoes off; let's go.

843
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:09,968
Kick them off.
Kick them off.

844
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:11,467
Spread 'em out.
Come on; let's go.

845
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,467
You've done this before.

846
00:51:12,468 --> 00:51:13,634
Pat her down.

847
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:15,400
Keep that chest
pressed against the wall.

848
00:51:15,401 --> 00:51:17,334
<i>You think just because you can</i>
<i>send me back to prison,</i>

849
00:51:17,335 --> 00:51:18,434
<i>you're strong?</i>

850
00:51:18,435 --> 00:51:19,734
<i>Control yourself.</i>
I'm strong.

851
00:51:19,735 --> 00:51:20,734
<i>Shut up.</i>

852
00:51:20,735 --> 00:51:22,934
Stand up straight.

853
00:51:22,935 --> 00:51:25,734
Right foot up.
Right foot up.

854
00:51:25,735 --> 00:51:27,567
Right foot up.

855
00:51:27,568 --> 00:51:28,968
You are fucking
with the wrong one today.

856
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:30,267
Put your right foot up.
Get your foot up!

857
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:33,868
Left foot up.

858
00:51:33,869 --> 00:51:35,634
Left food up.

859
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:37,934
Spread 'em.
Officer.

860
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,367
<i>I could violate your ass</i>
<i>right now,</i>

861
00:51:47,368 --> 00:51:48,567
send you back to prison
for two more years.

862
00:51:48,568 --> 00:51:49,501
Is that what you want?

863
00:52:03,234 --> 00:52:06,501
But a job came through
for you,

864
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:09,434
and I'm going
to let you take it.

865
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,000
Top of your head.
Look away.

866
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:22,868
Listen,
I'm going to do good.

867
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:24,200
Just--just be quiet.

868
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:26,100
I graduated a lot of programs
when I was in prison.

869
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,534
Look, shut up.

870
00:52:28,535 --> 00:52:30,467
Put your shoes back on.

871
00:52:36,534 --> 00:52:38,501
It's a Catholic Charities
youth organization,

872
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:40,567
summer program
over on Irvine Turner.

873
00:52:40,568 --> 00:52:42,901
Monroe somehow convinced them

874
00:52:42,902 --> 00:52:45,467
<i>that you'd been</i>
<i>rehabilitated.</i>

875
00:52:45,468 --> 00:52:46,968
<i>Here's the address.</i>

876
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:57,601
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

877
00:52:57,602 --> 00:52:59,033
Thank you.

878
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:02,234
<i>Everybody in line?</i>
<i>Everybody ready?</i>

879
00:53:02,235 --> 00:53:04,300
<i>I want to see if you guys</i>
<i>are tough.</i>

880
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:05,868
All right.
Okay, come on.

881
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:07,567
Let's see what you got.

882
00:53:07,568 --> 00:53:09,100
Good, good.

883
00:53:09,101 --> 00:53:10,100
Okay, end of the line.

884
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:11,334
What's your name?
Zak.

885
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:12,734
Okay, Zak,
let's see what you got.

886
00:53:12,735 --> 00:53:13,734
Uh-huh, uh-huh,

887
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:14,901
but this is what
you got to do.

888
00:53:14,902 --> 00:53:16,434
You got to bend
your knees, see?

889
00:53:16,435 --> 00:53:17,734
And you got
to follow through.

890
00:53:17,735 --> 00:53:18,734
Okay, let's see.

891
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:20,734
Follow through.
Good, good.

892
00:53:20,735 --> 00:53:22,100
You are a little badass.

893
00:53:22,101 --> 00:53:23,100
One more.

894
00:53:23,101 --> 00:53:24,234
Ow!

895
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:25,467
Ow, he's strong.

896
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,567
He's--how about you?

897
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:27,734
What have you got?

898
00:53:27,735 --> 00:53:29,067
You got to show me
a little harder.

899
00:53:29,068 --> 00:53:30,868
I want to see
that power you got.

900
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:32,100
Good.

901
00:53:32,101 --> 00:53:34,200
Yeah, you know
what you're doing.

902
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:35,434
You got to bend
your knees.

903
00:53:35,435 --> 00:53:36,701
You got to focus,
Chastity.

904
00:53:36,702 --> 00:53:37,701
You got to focus.

905
00:53:37,702 --> 00:53:38,834
You got to focus.

906
00:53:38,835 --> 00:53:40,200
Yeah, what's your name?

907
00:53:40,201 --> 00:53:41,734
Russel.
That's good, Russel.

908
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:43,133
One more, Russel.
You got one more.

909
00:53:43,134 --> 00:53:44,801
Good, good, good.

910
00:53:44,802 --> 00:53:46,067
All right,
I know your name.

911
00:53:46,068 --> 00:53:48,334
Let's see--

912
00:53:48,335 --> 00:53:49,334
Okay.

913
00:53:49,335 --> 00:53:50,634
We can't play
this game anymore.

914
00:53:50,635 --> 00:53:51,634
Let's play another game.

915
00:53:51,635 --> 00:53:52,767
Let's play z

916
00:53:52,768 --> 00:53:55,834
Okay, who told me
they wanted to be a dinosaur?

917
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:37,934
What's up?

918
00:54:37,935 --> 00:54:39,634
What are you
doing here?

919
00:54:39,635 --> 00:54:41,367
I just came by
to say hey.

920
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:45,534
Uh... I'm kind of busy
right now.

921
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:47,234
Oh, yeah?

922
00:54:47,235 --> 00:54:48,968
Yeah.

923
00:54:48,969 --> 00:54:52,167
You got a broad
in there?

924
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,934
I fucking thought
you liked me, man.

925
00:54:56,935 --> 00:54:58,267
I do like you.

926
00:54:58,268 --> 00:54:59,667
Hey, no, wait,
wait, wait.

927
00:54:59,668 --> 00:55:01,467
<i>From a bank robbery</i>

928
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:02,868
<i>at 1091 3rd Avenue.</i>

929
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:04,767
<i>A male black</i>
<i>about 6 feet tall</i>

930
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:07,767
<i>with one eye,</i>
<i>wearing a white do-rag</i>

931
00:55:07,768 --> 00:55:09,567
<i>under a yellow hard hat.</i>

932
00:55:09,568 --> 00:55:10,868
<i>The direction?</i>

933
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:12,567
<i>It's heading...</i>

934
00:55:12,568 --> 00:55:15,367
All right, come back
in 20 minutes, all right?

935
00:55:15,368 --> 00:55:17,968
Yeah, okay.
Okay!

936
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:19,901
20 minutes.

937
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:01,133
So what's her name?

938
00:56:01,134 --> 00:56:02,133
<i>Where does she live?</i>

939
00:56:02,134 --> 00:56:03,434
<i>Why should I tell you,</i>

940
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:04,868
<i>so you can hunt her down</i>
<i>and beat her ass?</i>

941
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:07,234
No, I'm not going
back to prison, Dean.

942
00:56:07,235 --> 00:56:08,934
I just want to know
who this bitch is

943
00:56:08,935 --> 00:56:11,601
you'd rather be fucking
than me.

944
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:14,667
<i>No way you want to go</i>
<i>down that road.</i>

945
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:19,167
Oh, yeah, tell me more.

946
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:20,434
I be you wouldn't like it

947
00:56:20,435 --> 00:56:22,801
<i>if I started fucking</i>
<i>Andy Kelly.</i>

948
00:56:22,802 --> 00:56:24,100
<i>It wouldn't matter to me.</i>

949
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:25,968
Oh, no?

950
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,767
Fucking figures.

951
00:56:28,768 --> 00:56:31,133
At least he knows
how to eat pussy.

952
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,100
What was that?
I didn't hear you.

953
00:56:34,101 --> 00:56:35,801
Nothing.

954
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:43,868
Shit.

955
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,801
I'm sorry.

956
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:51,834
I'm such a piece of shit
sometimes.

957
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:54,267
I can't control myself.

958
00:56:54,268 --> 00:56:58,167
Nobody owns anybody.

959
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:01,868
The state of New Jersey
owns my ass.

960
00:57:09,234 --> 00:57:12,534
I miss my friend, man.

961
00:57:12,535 --> 00:57:13,934
Crusher.

962
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:15,434
<i>She always had my back.</i>

963
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:17,067
Well, I can be your friend.

964
00:57:17,068 --> 00:57:18,634
It's not about that.

965
00:57:21,734 --> 00:57:24,200
What are you cooking?

966
00:57:24,201 --> 00:57:26,200
Venison stew.

967
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:29,067
What's that?

968
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:31,133
It's deer meat.

969
00:57:31,134 --> 00:57:32,801
Mmm.

970
00:57:32,802 --> 00:57:35,400
I never ate Bambi before.

971
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:37,434
Well, actually,
it isn't Bambi.

972
00:57:37,435 --> 00:57:40,601
It's Bambi's daddy.

973
00:57:40,602 --> 00:57:41,767
Ooh, yeah?

974
00:57:41,768 --> 00:57:46,267
Bambi's daddy,
that's pretty funny.

975
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,467
Bobby, hey, what's up?

976
00:58:09,468 --> 00:58:11,000
Yeah?

977
00:58:11,001 --> 00:58:14,200
I had my first day
of work today.

978
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:15,367
It was cool.

979
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:18,133
Made me think of my baby.

980
00:58:18,134 --> 00:58:23,934
Is she there?
I really want to talk to her.

981
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:26,501
Why do you always got to tell me
the same shit, Bobby?

982
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:27,667
I know she's there.

983
00:58:27,668 --> 00:58:29,133
I know she's fucking awake.

984
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:35,067
It's 7:30.

985
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:36,167
What about her birthday?

986
00:58:36,168 --> 00:58:38,801
You guys have
anything planned?

987
00:58:38,802 --> 00:58:41,267
Oh, yeah, I will--
I will be there.

988
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:21,901
* Yeah, we do! *

989
00:59:57,067 --> 00:59:58,968


990
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:02,334
<i>Okay, at this next block,</i>

991
01:00:02,335 --> 01:00:03,667
turn left.

992
01:00:03,668 --> 01:00:05,367
Yes, ma'am.

993
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:08,100
<i>It's the third house</i>
<i>on the left.</i>

994
01:00:08,101 --> 01:00:09,701
<i>You grew up there?</i>

995
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:10,834
<i>Yup.</i>

996
01:00:10,835 --> 01:00:12,734
<i>That's fancy.</i>

997
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:14,367
<i>I guess.</i>

998
01:00:14,368 --> 01:00:15,367
<i>You want to come in</i>

999
01:00:15,368 --> 01:00:16,701
and meet my family?

1000
01:00:16,702 --> 01:00:19,033
No, no, you go
and enjoy your daughter.

1001
01:00:19,034 --> 01:00:23,100
Call me when you're ready
to be picked up.

1002
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,267
All right,
I'll see you later.

1003
01:00:27,268 --> 01:00:28,701
Bye-bye.

1004
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:39,367
Hello!

1005
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,367


1006
01:00:47,368 --> 01:00:49,033
Hey, wait.

1007
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:50,167
Dean!

1008
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:53,200
Dean, wait!
Wait! Wait!

1009
01:00:53,201 --> 01:00:55,367


1010
01:00:55,368 --> 01:00:59,067
Those fuckers aren't home.

1011
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:00,267
<i>What do you want</i>
<i>to do?</i>

1012
01:01:00,268 --> 01:01:02,868
Um...

1013
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:04,534
Let's go
to my dad's house.

1014
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,267
Maybe they're there.

1015
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,334
You're late.
We just finished the cake.

1016
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:34,434
Well, maybe if you'd told me
where the party was at--

1017
01:01:34,435 --> 01:01:36,267
hold on one second.

1018
01:01:36,268 --> 01:01:39,200


1019
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:47,033
<i>Hey, Alexis, I think you have</i>
<i>more presents to open.</i>

1020
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:48,567
<i>Don't push me.</i>

1021
01:01:50,968 --> 01:01:53,701
Hi, Alexis.

1022
01:01:53,702 --> 01:01:56,701
Alexis, hey.

1023
01:01:56,702 --> 01:01:58,968
Happy birthday, baby.

1024
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:00,567
Happy birthday.

1025
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:05,868
<i>Happy, happy,</i>
<i>happy birthday.</i>

1026
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:07,801
Sherry brought you
some presents.

1027
01:02:07,802 --> 01:02:09,033
What do you say?

1028
01:02:09,034 --> 01:02:11,033
Thanks.

1029
01:02:11,034 --> 01:02:12,367
Here you go, babe.

1030
01:02:12,368 --> 01:02:13,367
Can I open it?

1031
01:02:13,368 --> 01:02:15,133
Go ahead; open it.

1032
01:02:15,134 --> 01:02:16,667
<i>Open all of them.</i>
<i>Open them.</i>

1033
01:02:16,668 --> 01:02:17,767
<i>I want to open one.</i>

1034
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:19,200
Oh, look at this.

1035
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:22,534
You're going to look
just like a ballerina.

1036
01:02:23,534 --> 01:02:25,033
<i>Sherry Anne.</i>

1037
01:02:25,034 --> 01:02:29,534
Welcome.

1038
01:02:29,535 --> 01:02:30,734
Can I get you a drink?

1039
01:02:30,735 --> 01:02:32,968
Yeah, thanks.

1040
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:35,100
Number two.

1041
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:36,701
<i>I don't want to play anymore!</i>

1042
01:02:36,702 --> 01:02:39,167
Look at it.
Look at the front, though.

1043
01:02:39,168 --> 01:02:41,534
Candy lipstick.

1044
01:02:41,535 --> 01:02:44,767
And this is special gum.

1045
01:02:44,768 --> 01:02:45,901
Special gum?

1046
01:02:45,902 --> 01:02:47,100
Yeah, but it's inside.

1047
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:48,300
So much candy.

1048
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:50,734
You want to open it?

1049
01:02:50,735 --> 01:02:52,601
Game Boy.

1050
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,634
You have one of those
already, sweetie.

1051
01:02:54,635 --> 01:02:56,133
You do?
I could take it back.

1052
01:02:56,134 --> 01:02:58,234
If you want to,
I'll find you something else.

1053
01:02:58,235 --> 01:02:59,367
No.

1054
01:02:59,368 --> 01:03:00,534
I want two Game Boys.

1055
01:03:00,535 --> 01:03:02,100
You can't have two;
that's silly.

1056
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:04,267
You can have
whatever you want, baby.

1057
01:03:04,268 --> 01:03:06,267
<i>Lookit. You got finger paints.</i>

1058
01:03:06,268 --> 01:03:07,834
<i>No!</i>

1059
01:03:07,835 --> 01:03:09,534
That's my present!

1060
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:10,934
It's mine.

1061
01:03:10,935 --> 01:03:13,501
No fair.

1062
01:03:13,502 --> 01:03:16,000
It's my present.

1063
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,501
Yes, honey.

1064
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,501
Alexis.

1065
01:03:18,502 --> 01:03:19,634
It's your present.

1066
01:03:19,635 --> 01:03:21,067
Nobody is going to take it
away from you.

1067
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:22,767
<i>What happened?</i>

1068
01:03:22,768 --> 01:03:25,133
<i>What's going on?</i>

1069
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,267
Let's go, guys.

1070
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:28,234
Let's go downstairs
and play musical chairs.

1071
01:03:28,235 --> 01:03:29,501
<i>Let's go, everybody.</i>

1072
01:03:29,502 --> 01:03:30,834
I think they need
some time out.

1073
01:03:30,835 --> 01:03:32,801
<i>You come too.</i>

1074
01:03:32,802 --> 01:03:34,901
<i>Here we go, everybody.</i>

1075
01:03:34,902 --> 01:03:36,334
<i>We're all coming.</i>

1076
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:42,267
What a mess, huh?

1077
01:03:42,268 --> 01:03:45,300
<i>Whoo!</i>

1078
01:03:45,301 --> 01:03:49,567
<i>Okay, not fair.</i>

1079
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:55,033
You all right?

1080
01:03:58,934 --> 01:04:02,434
<i>Dad,</i>

1081
01:04:02,435 --> 01:04:04,901
I feel like--

1082
01:04:04,902 --> 01:04:06,767
I don't know what to do.

1083
01:04:06,768 --> 01:04:10,467
I feel like they're taking her
away from me.

1084
01:04:10,468 --> 01:04:13,634
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

1085
01:04:13,635 --> 01:04:14,734


1086
01:04:14,735 --> 01:04:18,000
Bobby and Lynette,
they love you a whole lot.

1087
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:19,734
I love you.

1088
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:24,234
<i>Dad, she won't even talk to me.</i>

1089
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:28,300
You should have seen her
when I first came back.

1090
01:04:28,301 --> 01:04:29,567
She was playing with me.

1091
01:04:29,568 --> 01:04:30,601
She was hugging me.

1092
01:04:30,602 --> 01:04:31,801
She was calling me Mommy.

1093
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:35,434
They told her
not to call me Mommy anymore.

1094
01:04:35,435 --> 01:04:36,834
<i>Can you believe that shit?</i>

1095
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:38,734
<i>Sherry, just give them</i>
<i>some time</i>

1096
01:04:38,735 --> 01:04:40,334
<i>to get used to you again.</i>

1097
01:04:41,567 --> 01:04:43,667
Come on.

1098
01:04:43,668 --> 01:04:45,601
I know, but...

1099
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:50,501
Come on.

1100
01:04:58,834 --> 01:05:00,934
<i>Just give it a little time,</i>
<i>honey.</i>

1101
01:05:16,133 --> 01:05:17,067
<i>What?</i>

1102
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,767
Sherry, what?

1103
01:05:27,334 --> 01:05:29,267


1104
01:06:02,434 --> 01:06:04,367
Baby, you got
that taste?

1105
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:46,968
Keep you coming back.

1106
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:48,467
It works if you work it.

1107
01:08:48,468 --> 01:08:51,000
It won't if you don't.

1108
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:58,067
What happened to you?

1109
01:08:58,068 --> 01:09:01,033
I walked home, man.

1110
01:09:01,034 --> 01:09:04,033
You're also fucked up.

1111
01:09:04,034 --> 01:09:05,534
Come on;
let's go clean you up.

1112
01:09:05,535 --> 01:09:08,801
Hey, lay off the goods,
man.

1113
01:09:08,802 --> 01:09:10,334
I can walk.

1114
01:09:10,335 --> 01:09:12,267
Well, then, let's walk.

1115
01:09:41,234 --> 01:09:43,767


1116
01:09:46,234 --> 01:09:47,767
<i>Can I come in?</i>

1117
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:49,734
Yeah.

1118
01:09:55,968 --> 01:09:57,901


1119
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,901
<i>Come on;</i>
<i>get undressed.</i>

1120
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:37,934
You are a real,
live Injun, Dean.

1121
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:50,734
I bet you're
a good dad.

1122
01:10:50,735 --> 01:10:54,434
It's too bad your kids
never get to see you.

1123
01:10:54,435 --> 01:10:59,534
I'm--I'm going
this winter.

1124
01:10:59,535 --> 01:11:01,467
Want to go with me?

1125
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:08,000
One day
at a time, right?

1126
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:14,534
<i>Hey.</i>

1127
01:11:14,535 --> 01:11:15,734
Lazy lady.

1128
01:11:15,735 --> 01:11:17,033
Come on, sleepy,
get up.

1129
01:11:17,034 --> 01:11:19,701
Wake up.

1130
01:11:19,702 --> 01:11:22,767
I was dreaming so much.

1131
01:11:22,768 --> 01:11:25,934
I want my baby back, Dean.

1132
01:11:25,935 --> 01:11:30,400
I want Alexis.

1133
01:11:30,401 --> 01:11:32,334
You know, if you
stop talking so much

1134
01:11:32,335 --> 01:11:34,901
about what you want,
stop being so selfish,

1135
01:11:34,902 --> 01:11:40,167
maybe what you want
will come to you on its own.

1136
01:11:40,168 --> 01:11:42,100
Okay.

1137
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:49,100
I'm just mad
'cause I suck.

1138
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:55,267
Shit.

1139
01:11:55,268 --> 01:11:57,501
Dean?

1140
01:11:57,502 --> 01:11:58,901
<i>Yeah?</i>

1141
01:11:58,902 --> 01:12:01,868
Do you have a long-sleeved shirt
or something I could borrow?

1142
01:12:01,869 --> 01:12:05,601
I can't go out like this.

1143
01:12:05,602 --> 01:12:09,734
* Wayp in the sky. *

1144
01:12:09,735 --> 01:12:11,701
* Way up in the sky. *

1145
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:14,000
* The mama bird flies. *

1146
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:17,501
* The mama bird flies. *

1147
01:12:17,502 --> 01:12:20,634
* While down in the nest. *

1148
01:12:20,635 --> 01:12:23,133
* While down in the nest. *

1149
01:12:23,134 --> 01:12:25,834
<i>* The baby birds rest. *</i>

1150
01:12:25,835 --> 01:12:32,100
* The baby birds rest. *

1151
01:12:32,101 --> 01:12:34,367
* wing on the left. *

1152
01:12:34,368 --> 01:12:37,534
* With a wing on the left. *

1153
01:12:37,535 --> 01:12:40,334
* And a... *

1154
01:12:40,335 --> 01:12:42,567
* wing on the right. *

1155
01:12:42,568 --> 01:12:47,167
* And a wing on the right. *

1156
01:12:47,168 --> 01:12:49,934
* The baby bird sleeps. *

1157
01:12:49,935 --> 01:12:53,133
* The baby bird sleeps. *

1158
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:56,667
* All through the night. *

1159
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:59,534
* All through the night. *

1160
01:12:59,535 --> 01:13:00,567
Shh!

1161
01:13:00,568 --> 01:13:02,467
Shh!

1162
01:13:02,468 --> 01:13:05,234
<i>Baby bird.</i>

1163
01:13:05,235 --> 01:13:09,200
They're sleeping.

1164
01:13:19,701 --> 01:13:23,634
How was work today?

1165
01:13:23,635 --> 01:13:25,200
How'd you get in here?

1166
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:27,400
I'm the one
who asks the questions.

1167
01:13:27,401 --> 01:13:28,701
<i>I don't answer.</i>

1168
01:13:28,702 --> 01:13:31,267
Fuck me, snoopy.

1169
01:13:31,268 --> 01:13:34,200
<i>You got to give me</i>
<i>a break.</i>

1170
01:13:41,534 --> 01:13:44,067
You look terrible.

1171
01:13:44,068 --> 01:13:45,000
Yeah.

1172
01:13:50,567 --> 01:13:52,300
What's going on?

1173
01:13:56,067 --> 01:13:58,367
I'm going to tell you
the truth.

1174
01:14:03,868 --> 01:14:05,801
I'm in trouble.

1175
01:14:11,601 --> 01:14:14,033
I'm dirty.

1176
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:16,167
You want to get clean?

1177
01:14:18,734 --> 01:14:21,234
You want inpatient?

1178
01:14:21,235 --> 01:14:23,133
No, I want outpatient.
Or prison.

1179
01:14:23,134 --> 01:14:26,434
No, because
I have to keep this job.

1180
01:14:27,567 --> 01:14:29,234
This job is the only thing
that I haven't--

1181
01:14:29,235 --> 01:14:30,701
Please, please,
let me keep this job.

1182
01:14:30,702 --> 01:14:31,801
It's inpatient
or prison.

1183
01:14:33,534 --> 01:14:35,234
Hello.

1184
01:14:35,235 --> 01:14:36,601
Yeah, I got my PO here.

1185
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:38,901
Can I call you back?

1186
01:14:38,902 --> 01:14:41,934
Please, please, please,
please, please.

1187
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:43,868
I lost my daughter.
I lost her.

1188
01:14:43,869 --> 01:14:46,067
I don't know--there's no
other way I can get her back.

1189
01:14:46,068 --> 01:14:48,634
Inpatient or prison;
your choice.

1190
01:14:48,635 --> 01:14:51,567
Ugh!

1191
01:14:51,568 --> 01:14:52,601
You know,
I don't get you.

1192
01:14:52,602 --> 01:14:53,701
You want to get clean.

1193
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:54,968
You don't want
to do the work.

1194
01:14:54,969 --> 01:14:56,234
You want your daughter,

1195
01:14:56,235 --> 01:15:00,934
but you don't want
to do the work.

1196
01:15:03,934 --> 01:15:05,667
I wish it could be
some other way,

1197
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:06,701
but at this point,

1198
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:11,534
you do not qualify
for outpatient.

1199
01:15:11,535 --> 01:15:13,601
Take the weekend.

1200
01:15:13,602 --> 01:15:15,400
Say good-bye
to your family.

1201
01:15:15,401 --> 01:15:17,567
Report to me Monday morning
at 8:00 a. m. ,

1202
01:15:17,568 --> 01:15:19,234
and I will take you down.

1203
01:15:19,235 --> 01:15:22,467
If I don't see you,
I will issue a warrant

1204
01:15:22,468 --> 01:15:24,400
for your arrest.

1205
01:15:47,234 --> 01:15:49,000
<i>You're probably not</i>
<i>going to believe this,</i>

1206
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:51,601
<i>but I think about you</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

1207
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,434
You're my sister.

1208
01:15:55,435 --> 01:15:57,367
I never forgot you.

1209
01:15:57,368 --> 01:16:04,133
You snaked me
with that bitch, Bobby.

1210
01:16:04,134 --> 01:16:05,801
I can't trust you.

1211
01:16:05,802 --> 01:16:09,834
I want you to get to know
your daughter, Sherry.

1212
01:16:09,835 --> 01:16:11,133
I really do.

1213
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:13,267
<i>But you got to put yourself</i>
<i>in our shoes.</i>

1214
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:15,400
<i>Lynette loves</i>
<i>that little girl</i>

1215
01:16:15,401 --> 01:16:17,567
like she was her own,
and to tell you the truth,

1216
01:16:17,568 --> 01:16:20,901
<i>I do too.</i>

1217
01:16:22,501 --> 01:16:23,567
<i>leave mine alone?</i>

1218
01:16:24,434 --> 01:16:26,701
We've been taking care of her.

1219
01:16:26,702 --> 01:16:28,534
You think that's easy?

1220
01:16:28,535 --> 01:16:30,701
<i>And we are going</i>
<i>to have our own kid,</i>

1221
01:16:30,702 --> 01:16:32,300
<i>maybe even two,</i>

1222
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:34,067
but we've been taking care
of Alexis

1223
01:16:34,068 --> 01:16:35,634
<i>because of you,</i>
<i>remember?</i>

1224
01:16:35,635 --> 01:16:40,067
I know. I know.
I fucked up.

1225
01:16:40,068 --> 01:16:42,634
I always fuck up.

1226
01:16:51,334 --> 01:16:54,000
I know what
you've been through.

1227
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:56,067
Don't think I don't know
what you've been through.

1228
01:16:56,068 --> 01:16:59,167
What's that mean?

1229
01:16:59,168 --> 01:17:00,400
It means
I'm on your side.

1230
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:02,234
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1231
01:17:02,235 --> 01:17:05,734
<i>It means I'm on your side,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

1232
01:17:05,735 --> 01:17:07,200
<i>I'm on your fucking side.</i>

1233
01:17:13,868 --> 01:17:16,501
So will you let me
take her out alone,

1234
01:17:16,502 --> 01:17:19,901
<i>just me and her,</i>

1235
01:17:19,902 --> 01:17:21,968
so she's not
scared of me anymore?

1236
01:17:26,901 --> 01:17:28,701
<i>Okay.</i>

1237
01:17:30,334 --> 01:17:32,467
Okay, but no sleepovers,
okay?

1238
01:17:32,468 --> 01:17:37,267
<i>One step at a time,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

1239
01:17:37,268 --> 01:17:38,734
You love me?

1240
01:17:38,735 --> 01:17:41,367
Yes, I love you.

1241
01:17:41,368 --> 01:17:44,167
<i>I know.</i>

1242
01:18:30,367 --> 01:18:31,701
<i>No!</i>

1243
01:18:31,702 --> 01:18:33,067
<i>Alexis.</i>

1244
01:18:34,868 --> 01:18:37,400
Oh, hi.

1245
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:38,400
<i>Hey.</i>

1246
01:18:40,267 --> 01:18:41,567
Hi.

1247
01:18:41,568 --> 01:18:43,200
Alexis,
go put on your shoes.

1248
01:18:43,201 --> 01:18:44,567
Sherry's here
to take you.

1249
01:18:44,568 --> 01:18:46,000
I'll go get her ready.

1250
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:47,801
I hope you're happy,

1251
01:18:47,802 --> 01:18:49,934
because nobody else is.

1252
01:18:49,935 --> 01:18:52,634
Excuse me.

1253
01:18:52,635 --> 01:18:54,534
Come on,
put your shoesies on, okay?

1254
01:18:54,535 --> 01:18:56,901
<i>And you should like...</i>

1255
01:18:56,902 --> 01:19:00,234
Hey, Lexi.

1256
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:01,334
<i>What is it, baby?</i>

1257
01:19:01,335 --> 01:19:02,734
<i>I don't want to go, Bobby.</i>

1258
01:19:02,735 --> 01:19:04,067
<i>It's okay, sweetie.</i>

1259
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:05,901
You're going to have a fun day
with your mother.

1260
01:19:05,902 --> 01:19:08,234
Why, baby?
You scared?

1261
01:19:08,235 --> 01:19:09,767
You can tell Mama.

1262
01:19:09,768 --> 01:19:13,367
Let's pack her green shirt too,
just in case she gets dirty.

1263
01:19:13,368 --> 01:19:14,901
Okay.

1264
01:19:14,902 --> 01:19:16,133
I got it.

1265
01:19:16,134 --> 01:19:17,734


1266
01:19:17,735 --> 01:19:19,534
<i>Alexis, let's put</i>
<i>your backpack on.</i>

1267
01:19:19,535 --> 01:19:21,534
<i>Come on, sweetie,</i>
<i>please.</i>

1268
01:19:21,535 --> 01:19:22,767
I don't want to go, Bobby.

1269
01:19:22,768 --> 01:19:25,067
Sweetie, come on;
it's going to be fun.

1270
01:19:25,068 --> 01:19:26,667
Here, I'll carry you out,
okay?

1271
01:19:26,668 --> 01:19:28,167
<i>Don't forget this.</i>

1272
01:19:28,168 --> 01:19:29,234
You look so pretty
in this.

1273
01:19:29,235 --> 01:19:30,968
<i>Oh, what a big girl.</i>

1274
01:19:30,969 --> 01:19:32,267
Come here; let me
put this on you.

1275
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,934
Keep your hair
out of your face.

1276
01:19:34,935 --> 01:19:36,167
<i>I'll see you later,</i>
<i>okay,</i>

1277
01:19:36,168 --> 01:19:38,601
<i>and make some cheeseburgers</i>
<i>for supper, okay?</i>

1278
01:19:38,602 --> 01:19:40,033
<i>Okay, have fun.</i>

1279
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:45,400
<i>Bye, Lyn.</i>

1280
01:19:45,401 --> 01:19:49,501
Okay.

1281
01:19:49,502 --> 01:19:51,801
You're gonna have
a fun day, okay?

1282
01:19:51,802 --> 01:19:56,367
Remember what I told you?

1283
01:19:56,368 --> 01:19:59,934
You're gonna have fun.

1284
01:19:59,935 --> 01:20:03,267
Can you get the door?

1285
01:20:03,268 --> 01:20:08,100
It's going to be a good time;
I promise, okay?

1286
01:20:08,101 --> 01:20:09,400
Come on, let go.

1287
01:20:11,133 --> 01:20:12,267
Let go, baby.

1288
01:20:12,268 --> 01:20:13,601
Okay.

1289
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:15,534
No, no, no, no,
put it in the front seat.

1290
01:20:15,535 --> 01:20:17,634
Sherry, it needs to go
in the back; that's the law.

1291
01:20:17,635 --> 01:20:18,634
Always in the back, okay?

1292
01:20:18,635 --> 01:20:21,000
Come here, sweetie.

1293
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:22,534
Come on, please.

1294
01:20:22,535 --> 01:20:24,067
Come on.
Here we go.

1295
01:20:26,033 --> 01:20:28,667
Put your legs down.

1296
01:20:28,668 --> 01:20:30,501
Just like our car.

1297
01:20:30,502 --> 01:20:32,567
I don't want to go,
Bobby.

1298
01:20:32,568 --> 01:20:34,133
Okay, but see,
this is the day

1299
01:20:34,134 --> 01:20:36,033
that you get to know Sherry
better, okay?

1300
01:20:37,601 --> 01:20:38,667
<i>Okay?</i>

1301
01:20:38,668 --> 01:20:39,734
Okay.

1302
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:40,834
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

1303
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:42,000
<i>You don't want to go?</i>

1304
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:43,200
<i>Well, listen to me.</i>

1305
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:45,100
<i>You're going to have fun,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

1306
01:20:45,101 --> 01:20:46,467
<i>I promise.</i>

1307
01:20:46,468 --> 01:20:47,868
Okay.

1308
01:20:47,869 --> 01:20:51,033
<i>What time are you</i>
<i>going to have her back?</i>

1309
01:20:51,034 --> 01:20:52,834
Um...

1310
01:20:52,835 --> 01:20:54,501
I don't know,
4:00 or something.

1311
01:20:54,502 --> 01:20:56,300
Okay, 4:00.


1312
01:20:56,301 --> 01:20:58,601
<i>Hey. You okay, baby?</i>

1313
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,133
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1314
01:21:01,134 --> 01:21:02,300
<i>She's okay.</i>

1315
01:21:02,301 --> 01:21:04,234
She'll be--
she'll be all right.

1316
01:21:04,235 --> 01:21:06,701


1317
01:21:06,702 --> 01:21:10,868
<i>Alexis,</i>
<i>it's going to be okay.</i>

1318
01:21:10,869 --> 01:21:14,834
<i>You're going to have</i>
<i>a fun day, okay?</i>

1319
01:21:14,835 --> 01:21:17,000
You're going to have
a good time.

1320
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:18,801
Have fun with her,
okay?

1321
01:21:18,802 --> 01:21:21,033
Thanks.

1322
01:22:21,934 --> 01:22:24,400
* With a wing on the left. *

1323
01:22:24,401 --> 01:22:26,901
* With a wing on the left. *

1324
01:22:26,902 --> 01:22:29,868
* And a wing
on the right. *

1325
01:22:29,869 --> 01:22:32,601
* And a wing
on the right. *

1326
01:22:32,602 --> 01:22:35,634
* The baby bird
sleeps. *

1327
01:22:35,635 --> 01:22:39,901
* The baby bird
sleeps. *

1328
01:22:39,902 --> 01:22:41,501
* All through the night. *

1329
01:22:41,502 --> 01:22:43,934
* All through the night. *

1330
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:49,367
I'm hungry.
Are you hungry?

1331
01:22:49,368 --> 01:22:50,367
Yeah.

1332
01:22:50,368 --> 01:22:52,100
You want junk food?

1333
01:22:52,101 --> 01:22:53,834
Yes.
Yes.

1334
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:54,968
I'm starving.

1335
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:57,000
Me too.

1336
01:22:57,001 --> 01:22:58,367
You want to push it?

1337
01:22:58,368 --> 01:23:00,400
I want chicken nuggets.

1338
01:23:00,401 --> 01:23:01,501
Okay.

1339
01:23:01,502 --> 01:23:03,400
<i>And I want to eat...</i>

1340
01:23:03,401 --> 01:23:05,400
<i>french fries.</i>

1341
01:23:05,401 --> 01:23:07,434
I want french fries too.

1342
01:23:07,435 --> 01:23:08,868
And...

1343
01:23:08,869 --> 01:23:11,734
So when are we going to get
to miniature golf?

1344
01:23:11,735 --> 01:23:14,501
Soon.

1345
01:23:14,502 --> 01:23:16,667
Really soon.

1346
01:23:16,668 --> 01:23:20,467
I've never did
miniature golf before.

1347
01:23:20,468 --> 01:23:21,701
You never did?

1348
01:23:21,702 --> 01:23:23,133
Uh-uh, never.

1349
01:23:23,134 --> 01:23:25,901
That's a shame.

1350
01:23:25,902 --> 01:23:28,968
Did you ever go
to Florida?

1351
01:23:28,969 --> 01:23:29,968
Florida?

1352
01:23:29,969 --> 01:23:31,767
Yeah.

1353
01:23:31,768 --> 01:23:33,367
No.

1354
01:23:33,368 --> 01:23:35,100
Me neither.

1355
01:23:35,101 --> 01:23:37,167
You want to go?

1356
01:23:37,168 --> 01:23:40,133
Lyn and Bobby went,

1357
01:23:40,134 --> 01:23:42,400
and I stayed
at Grandma Mary's.

1358
01:23:42,401 --> 01:23:43,667
Hmm.

1359
01:23:43,668 --> 01:23:49,868
She--she lets me stay up late
and watch late movies...

1360
01:23:49,869 --> 01:23:51,601
This thing
looks like it hurts.

1361
01:23:51,602 --> 01:23:56,067
And has a little dog
that's named Isabella.

1362
01:23:56,068 --> 01:23:57,434
It's mean?

1363
01:23:57,435 --> 01:24:01,000
No, it's named Isabella,
but it's a nice dog.

1364
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:03,067
It's a little
French bulldog.

1365
01:24:03,068 --> 01:24:08,400
So do you want to go
to Florida?

1366
01:24:08,401 --> 01:24:10,133
Mommy?

1367
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:11,901
Yes, my love?

1368
01:24:11,902 --> 01:24:13,767
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1369
01:24:13,768 --> 01:24:15,701
You do?

1370
01:24:15,702 --> 01:24:18,400
Okay, let's go.
One more.

1371
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:24,234


1372
01:24:24,235 --> 01:24:28,200
<i>Come on. Damn it.</i>

1373
01:24:28,201 --> 01:24:29,267
<i>Go in the bathroom.</i>

1374
01:24:29,268 --> 01:24:30,834
Jesus Christ.

1375
01:24:30,835 --> 01:24:33,567
You like embarrassing me
like that?

1376
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:35,567
Do you?

1377
01:24:35,568 --> 01:24:37,467
Why don't you answer me?

1378
01:24:37,468 --> 01:24:40,601
You never listen to me,
and you never answer me.

1379
01:24:40,602 --> 01:24:41,934
Look at me
when I talk to you.

1380
01:24:41,935 --> 01:24:43,100
You want me
to leave you here?

1381
01:24:43,101 --> 01:24:44,234
Is that what you want?

1382
01:24:44,235 --> 01:24:45,901
You're lucky
that I'm here with my girl,

1383
01:24:45,902 --> 01:24:47,534
or I'd beat the living shit
out of you,

1384
01:24:47,535 --> 01:24:48,634
you fucking bully!

1385
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,534
Lexis?

1386
01:24:55,535 --> 01:25:00,467
Lexis,
I'm sorry.

1387
01:25:00,468 --> 01:25:02,133
Lexi, Lexi.

1388
01:25:02,134 --> 01:25:04,234
Hey, baby.

1389
01:25:04,235 --> 01:25:06,000
Alexis,
what are you doing?

1390
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:08,634
Did you go
to the bathroom?

1391
01:25:08,635 --> 01:25:10,634
Lexi,
open up the door.

1392
01:25:10,635 --> 01:25:12,868
Open up the door.

1393
01:25:12,869 --> 01:25:14,200


1394
01:25:14,201 --> 01:25:16,634
Come here.
What is it?

1395
01:25:17,634 --> 01:25:19,300
Oh, what happened?

1396
01:25:22,767 --> 01:25:24,067
It's okay.

1397
01:25:24,068 --> 01:25:26,367
I'm scared, Sherry.

1398
01:25:26,368 --> 01:25:27,300
It's okay.

1399
01:25:36,167 --> 01:25:37,567
All right.

1400
01:25:37,568 --> 01:25:39,934
I'm just gonna
get the keys.

1401
01:25:39,935 --> 01:25:41,868
Ugh, fuck.

1402
01:25:46,267 --> 01:25:49,133
Let's get these wet pants
off you.

1403
01:25:51,367 --> 01:25:54,501
Come on, you got to help me
get your shoes off.

1404
01:25:54,502 --> 01:25:56,701
Oh--come on.
Jesus.

1405
01:25:56,702 --> 01:26:01,067
Okay, and you do
the other one.

1406
01:26:03,968 --> 01:26:06,400
Fuck me.

1407
01:26:09,467 --> 01:26:12,634


1408
01:26:12,635 --> 01:26:15,234
<i>Okay, look what I got.</i>

1409
01:26:15,235 --> 01:26:16,534
<i>Oh--</i>

1410
01:26:16,535 --> 01:26:17,701
what's that?

1411
01:26:17,702 --> 01:26:20,667
Oh, look at this.

1412
01:26:20,668 --> 01:26:22,467
Come on, baby.

1413
01:26:22,468 --> 01:26:23,968
I'm trying.

1414
01:26:23,969 --> 01:26:25,701
Come here.

1415
01:26:25,702 --> 01:26:28,567
Okay,
take your panties off, Lex.

1416
01:26:28,568 --> 01:26:30,567
Sherry, close the door.

1417
01:26:30,568 --> 01:26:32,234
Hey, you got to help me.

1418
01:26:34,901 --> 01:26:35,834
All right.

1419
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,367
Come on, left foot.

1420
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:41,067
Left foot.

1421
01:26:41,068 --> 01:26:43,634
Do you even love me?

1422
01:26:52,734 --> 01:26:54,167
Tell me you love me.

1423
01:26:54,168 --> 01:26:55,334
I love you.

1424
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:59,501
Tell me,
"I love you, Mommy. "

1425
01:26:59,502 --> 01:27:04,434
I love you, Mommy.

1426
01:27:39,133 --> 01:27:41,067
Come on.

1427
01:28:16,267 --> 01:28:18,133
You know what?

1428
01:28:21,467 --> 01:28:26,567
I used to get scared too...

1429
01:28:26,568 --> 01:28:28,501
all the time.

1430
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:58,300
Watch your step, honey.

1431
01:28:58,301 --> 01:28:59,701
Why don't you go
say hi to Lynnie?

1432
01:28:59,702 --> 01:29:01,167
She's worried about you.

1433
01:29:01,168 --> 01:29:04,834
Lyn. Come here, Lyn.
I got to tell you something.

1434
01:29:09,133 --> 01:29:10,734
Did you guys have fun?

1435
01:29:12,334 --> 01:29:14,767
Yeah.

1436
01:29:14,768 --> 01:29:17,767
Thanks for calling.

1437
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,133
You know what, Bob?

1438
01:29:26,134 --> 01:29:28,067
What?

1439
01:29:34,601 --> 01:29:37,334
I never asked you this
the whole time that I was away.

1440
01:29:37,335 --> 01:29:39,300
I never asked you...

1441
01:29:39,301 --> 01:29:41,234
Asked me what, Sherry?

1442
01:29:49,367 --> 01:29:55,834
Could you help me
take care of my daughter?

1443
01:29:55,835 --> 01:29:59,834
I can't do it by myself.

1444
01:30:01,133 --> 01:30:02,367
Of course I can.

1445
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,167
What do you think
I've been doing?

1446
01:30:04,168 --> 01:30:06,601
I know,
but I never asked you.

1447
01:30:13,501 --> 01:30:14,567
Come here.

1448
01:30:14,568 --> 01:30:16,767
Yes.

1449
01:30:20,267 --> 01:30:26,234
You're gonna be okay.

1450
01:30:31,734 --> 01:30:33,400
You want
to come inside?

1451
01:30:33,401 --> 01:30:36,667
No.

1452
01:30:36,668 --> 01:30:38,367
You think you were worried
about Lexi.

1453
01:30:38,368 --> 01:30:41,767
Dean's probably waiting
by the window for his baby.

1454
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:48,767
Thanks.

1455
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:12,000
* Oh, I will free
the bird in me, *

1456
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:15,334
* oh, when I find my life, *

1457
01:31:15,335 --> 01:31:18,634
* what I always knew
could be, *

1458
01:31:18,635 --> 01:31:22,200
* oh, when I find my life. *

1459
01:31:22,201 --> 01:31:25,567
* I will see
the truth in me, *

1460
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:34,234
* oh, when I find my life. *

1461
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:45,734
* I will see
beyond the stain, *

1462
01:31:45,735 --> 01:31:49,200
* oh, when I find my life. *

1463
01:31:49,201 --> 01:31:52,901
* Fear of loss
and fear of gain, *

1464
01:31:52,902 --> 01:31:56,167
* oh, when I find my life. *

1465
01:31:56,168 --> 01:32:02,601
* Oh, when I find my life. *

1466
01:32:02,602 --> 01:32:09,801
* Oh, when I find my life. *

1467
01:32:09,802 --> 01:32:13,968
* I remember
all the days of shame *

1468
01:32:13,969 --> 01:32:18,300
* and all the lies
you told me. *

1469
01:32:23,868 --> 01:32:26,834
* I have worked
so hard to learn *

1470
01:32:26,835 --> 01:32:31,534
* and come so far
in my attempts to let it go, *

1471
01:32:31,535 --> 01:32:36,601
* my dear. *

1472
01:32:36,602 --> 01:32:43,534
* And it's so easy. *

1473
01:32:43,535 --> 01:32:50,167
* I just opened my eyes. *

1474
01:32:50,168 --> 01:32:56,734
* And it's so hard *

1475
01:32:56,735 --> 01:32:59,667
* to let go. *

1476
01:33:04,234 --> 01:33:08,100
* Oh, I will free
the bird in me *

1477
01:33:08,101 --> 01:33:11,701
* oh, when I find my life. *

1478
01:33:11,702 --> 01:33:15,367
* All will be
what I want to be, *

1479
01:33:15,368 --> 01:33:18,467
* oh, when I find my life. *

1480
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:22,200
* I am here,
and I am free, *

1481
01:33:22,201 --> 01:33:25,400
* oh, when I find my life. *

1482
01:33:25,401 --> 01:33:32,267
* Oh, when I find my life. *

1483
01:33:32,268 --> 01:33:39,367
* Oh, when I find my life. *

1484
01:33:39,368 --> 01:33:45,601
* Oh, when I find my life. *

1485
01:33:45,602 --> 01:33:51,334
* Oh, when I find my life. *
