1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THR3E (2006)

2
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,896
They were expecting us
but this is ridiculous.

3
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,092
It looks like... Mardi Gras.

4
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,052
A good luck.
- Thanks.

5
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,137
Look. What do you think?

6
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,576
You are a cunning businesswoman.

7
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,094
Is this the boat?
- Yes.

8
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,098
The former Massachusetts.
Ideal for these waters.

9
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,854
Well done, Jack. He is beautiful.

10
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,094
M. Madsen...
- Call me Jack.

11
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,574
Gary Richards. Your master.

12
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,816
This is Jennifer.
- Hi, Jennifer.

13
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,011
This is Gail.
- Hi, Gail.

14
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,130
And this is Bill.

15
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,732
Shy, slow, grumpy...
- Who is that?

16
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,812
Manny and Pepe.
They will help me.

17
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,608
Manny knows where the fish are.

18
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,738
If he wants...

19
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,218
Note the small ones.
There is a laptop.

20
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,529
I know what you think. Stout!

21
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,618
My God.

22
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,058
What happens?

23
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,697
This will leave traces.

24
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,448
Damn.
- Jack... difficult you do not.

25
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,338
She is right. Keep your outside.

26
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,929
That was strange.

27
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,935
Let's just eat.

28
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,458
There he goes again.
- It's true.

29
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,333
They were gay.
- But no. You imagine you in.

30
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,292
More than that even. They were so...

31
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,894
Damn.

32
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,208
Manny, bring a bottle.
Tonight we celebrate.

33
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,897
Health.
- At us. And the rest of the pot.

34
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,898
Our...
- And the rest of the pot!

35
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,333
Take a glass, Manny.

36
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,939
No, thanks.

37
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,854
Tough day at the port?
- Excuse me?

38
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,252
The señorita is difficult?
Drink a glass with us.

39
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,533
A little. What I am concerned,
does wonders.

40
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,657
Need anything?

41
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,939
No, everything okay. Thank you.

42
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,057
You had nothing to say, Jack.
- This guy is an idiot.

43
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,613
I have to lose.

44
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,811
For me is roads
on the quay as a Marlin.

45
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,773
I would you could tear.
- No, too late.

46
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,574
I have a headache.

47
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,692
Have a beer.
As in the good old days.

48
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,619
That I am happy.
- Come on, Homer.

49
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,138
Wil je 'n aspirin?
- No.

50
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,938
Show me your legs.

51
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,938
Merry Christmas.

52
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,569
Do you like?

53
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,810
Please use your teeth?

54
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,290
Tighter.

55
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,218
Ever get someone to.

56
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,049
What would he do?

57
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,452
Who says it's a 'he' is?

58
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,491
What would they do?

59
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,253
Not...

60
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,409
He call all the whole morning.
He makes me crazy.

61
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,014
Someone watch it on us.

62
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,330
Shall I tell him something?
- No.

63
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,299
Do we understand each other? Buy, okay?

64
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,139
A moment.
Manuel, have you seen him?

65
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,052
He makes some Margarita's ready.

66
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,738
We wait for 20 minutes on the beers.

67
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,334
's Problem, M. Madsen?

68
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,890
Yes. We are still awaiting the beers.

69
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,256
Immediately, señor.

70
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,257
I'll call you back.
- Señoras.

71
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,497
Thank you.

72
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,733
Thank you very much.

73
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,209
I do not like the attitude
that guy.

74
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,652
I care for it. Keep this course.

75
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,618
You provoke them. I see it.
- It provokes me.

76
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,856
It's a customer!
He gave a lot of money.

77
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,454
He has respect for anyone.

78
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,333
If you do not handle,
you can go.

79
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,178
Okay, I go.

80
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,177
Okay, you go off at the next port.

81
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,291
What happens?

82
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,652
Place ice cream and beer to top.

83
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,739
What is the problem, Manuel?

84
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,568
That is the problem.

85
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,568
Do what he asks.
- Do it yourself.

86
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,412
You have one.

87
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,089
Get him inside.

88
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,211
No, no. Let him go.
Do not do everything at once.

89
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,893
I hope they do not
to bring here.

90
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,255
Margarita Are there no more?

91
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,333
What will they do?
- Striking until he is dead.

92
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,173
Throw him back.

93
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,617
My God. Smoke.

94
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,218
Captain!
We have a problem above.

95
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,411
What happens?
- Everything is on fire.

96
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,378
Damn. Look how big he is.

97
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,928
Help us!

98
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,891
Manny, Evacuate passengers.
We leave the boat!

99
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,216
In the life review.

100
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,010
We can reach anyone!

101
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,131
It failed!

102
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,213
Captain!

103
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,539
Captain!

104
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,612
Captain!
- Attention.

105
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,256
I have found him.
He floated in the water.

106
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,936
My God!

107
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,777
Still others seen?

108
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,813
Seen Jack?

109
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,340
I can not believe it.

110
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,097
It is so cold.

111
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,292
I have huge cold.

112
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,697
It's okay. It is good.

113
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,893
Good day.

114
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,251
Thank you
have kept me warm tonight.

115
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,616
You did the same with me.

116
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,211
How long will it take
before they come looking for us?

117
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,372
They do not yet know
that we are missing.

118
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,051
Yes, but when they hear...

119
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,569
It can take weeks,
maybe months.

120
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,969
We are not in Miami.

121
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,734
It seems that the
you can not care what happens.

122
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,249
I am glad that I am still alive.

123
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,811
Wil you?

124
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,536
Is there anything else?

125
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,139
If lunch or dinner?
- No, I... in general.

126
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,769
Maybe catch, I got lucky.

127
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,374
Can we really no fire lighting?

128
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,930
With what?
- No idea.

129
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,292
You mask. The rock.
The knife. You can see it in movies.

130
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,770
There are no increases in glass.
And you will find no flint.

131
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,409
How do you know?
- Because I live in such a place.

132
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,533
You think I do not want to fire?
- No, no.

133
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,495
Excuse me.

134
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,091
We have a house built.

135
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,619
A house?

136
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,218
How are you?

137
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,136
I have pain everywhere.
Have you seen something?

138
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,053
Nothing.

139
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,134
We go swimming in the dark.
As clever of you.

140
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,894
And my blisters?
- It will be good to do.

141
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,289
Come on.

142
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,811
Leave your clothes on the beach.
You do not want to sleep in wet clothes.

143
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,450
Come on! There is none.
- You are there.

144
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,498
I do not see what it matters.

145
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,089
We have slept together.

146
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,458
Come on, I will turn a blind eye.

147
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,415
Do not look.

148
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,931
It is very pleasant.

149
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,536
See? You must learn to trust me.

150
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,098
Can I ask you a question?

151
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,454
Go ahead.

152
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,330
Why did you get that girl beaten
on the quay?

153
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,571
You look not a guy out.

154
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,975
They forced me to it.
- Haart store?

155
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,252
Yes. They hit me. They tamped me.

156
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,530
She made me ridiculous
for my friends.

157
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,890
Why did she do that?
- No idea.

158
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,011
Because she refuses
its problems.

159
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,969
She wants me to blame.
And she wants to punish me.

160
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,049
What problems have they?

161
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,699
She is pregnant.

162
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,932
Or that she says.
She wants to marry me.

163
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,814
But I refused.

164
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,210
Is she not a virgin?

165
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,458
Were you a virgin when you married?

166
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,334
That does not matter.
- Reply.

167
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,174
It is your business.
- I understand.

168
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,168
You want to know everything about my life,
but you said nothing about yours.

169
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,052
You work with two weights.

170
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,972
What are you talking about?

171
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,689
You like your man.

172
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,778
You're rich and you think
ways than the rest.

173
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,695
That is not true.
You do not know what I think.

174
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,739
You act stupid.
- Dom?

175
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,408
You think? Listen...

176
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,171
you can only survive
I eat because you give and for your concern.

177
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,968
I would not hear.

178
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,899
Wil you turn?

179
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,491
Smart ass, Señora!

180
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,459
A perfectly formed heart.

181
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,016
Then maybe God
you do not really heart it.

182
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,018
You sleep?

183
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,136
My mother did that with my father
when I was little.

184
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,333
They punished him doorte silence.
You know what he said to me?

185
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,328
"Pretend you're sad
and enjoy the silence. "

186
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,694
If you have cold,
put you against me.

187
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,417
Go fish?
- Near the reef.

188
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,098
Is not it dangerous?
- The best place for lobster.

189
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,293
What do you think?

190
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,935
From what?

191
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,138
Everything.

192
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,570
I do not want more
you argue, Manuel.

193
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,256
I would also not
argue with you, Señora.

194
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,970
Call me Jenny. Not "Señora".

195
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,133
Okay, Jenny.

196
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,089
Can we be friends?
- We are friends.

197
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,211
We sleep together. Have you forgotten?

198
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,573
You know where you are?

199
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,737
You know who I am?

200
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,698
Jenny!

201
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,848
Jack?

202
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,810
Where were you? Where did you find him?
- On the reef.

203
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,329
Is it? What have you done?

204
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,451
Calm down.
- Okay.

205
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,695
We are almost there.

206
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,458
Bye, honey.

207
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,892
I love you.

208
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,091
What took you so long as?

209
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,490
Put it here.

210
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,611
Jack, put you down, baby.

211
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,054
What? What is it?
- Not in my back.

212
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,653
Here is water.

213
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,056
Here, honey. Drink water.

214
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,934
I thought I had lost you.

215
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,859
Stop, dear...
- Thanks. Thank you.

216
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,818
Drink water.

217
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,253
Let me, honey.

218
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,412
I missed you.

219
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,696
I must lie down.

220
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,097
Let me.

221
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,893
He sleeps.

222
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,615
He seems not to remember.

223
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,418
He needed rest, nothing more.

224
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,615
Are you hungry?
- Yes.

225
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,731
Thanks you have saved him.

226
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,858
I had it almost done.

227
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,492
Just kidding.

228
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,856
Someone a hot breakfast?

229
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,137
How did you do that?
- What?

230
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,978
The fire lit?
- Oh, that.

231
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,939
I have two pieces of wood
rubbed against each other.

232
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,338
As they do with the scouts.

233
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,451
Unbelievable.
We were not successful.

234
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,618
And I could not catch lobster.

235
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,414
Where did they find?
- On the reef.

236
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,973
And you need glasses.

237
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,176
What sticks do you use?

238
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,976
It is not a native flora...

239
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,136
You cheated. I knew it.
You are a small child.

240
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,059
Good to see that you feel good.
- It's nice that I feel something.

241
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,768
And Bill and Gail?

242
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,889
I would not talk about.

243
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,095
But you were not silent.
I am... I... you know...

244
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,939
You have a cabin built.
Is there a tank? There is...

245
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,370
Manuel did't. I just helped.

246
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,210
Good work. I am builder
and I am impressed.

247
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,092
It smells good, baby.

248
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,733
Yes. Enter.

249
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,369
What do you want?
- I want to open.

250
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,496
Let me.

251
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,018
You trust me with a knife.

252
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,853
I want to keep sharp.

253
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,852
Boring.

254
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,813
Here.

255
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,179
Here.

256
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,053
Wil je?

257
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,976
Go ahead. I go swimming first.

258
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,090
He was so sweet.
- Yes?

259
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,417
it seems that he is good fun.

260
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,489
What do you mean?
- Come on.

261
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,369
It looks like the Blue Lagoon.
And I see no separate rooms.

262
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,332
Stop, Jack.
- "He was so sweet. "

263
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,094
We have been trying for 2 days to survive.

264
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,056
We had no time
to build a Hilton.

265
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,978
But you had time to
's wedding suite building.

266
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,892
Where are you going?
- I go swimming.

267
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,490
Go. Great.
All children love.

268
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,093
Sorry.

269
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,538
Excuse me.

270
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,133
I'm tired.

271
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,255
I am sad. I am angry.

272
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,052
I'm grumpy.

273
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,290
And... I, I, I, I...

274
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,456
And I'm sorry.

275
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,809
We must agree.

276
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,176
Only in this way we come here.

277
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,095
You're right. Easy to...

278
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,258
Stop to enjoy. Okay?

279
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,892
Does he know where we are?
- No.

280
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,220
Have you seen airplanes?
- No.

281
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,933
A boat?

282
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,535
Cargo ships. Corridors. Nothing?

283
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,174
No, nothing.
- Have you fucked him?

284
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,099
Yes.
- Good.

285
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,053
He is great.
- He is handsome.

286
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,298
Thank you.

287
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,497
What are you doing?

288
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,294
This fluid is
flavors to waste

289
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,819
and other
contain no liquid.

290
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,057
Take the more mature if you want
they are juicy.

291
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,776
Why a mask?

292
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,173
Mask.

293
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,938
No idea. He had him
when we arrived.

294
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,569
You think that strange?

295
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,419
The boat is on fire
and he thinks it a mask to take?

296
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,617
Maybe he was in his pocket.

297
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,779
Perhaps he was glad to see you.
- Very nice...

298
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,330
You make ridiculous.
- Oh, really?

299
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,893
How did it go?

300
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,098
The water is cloudy.

301
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,172
And the reef?

302
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,492
Too wild. I can not hold
what I collect.

303
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,254
Why do not you come?
- I have no sense.

304
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,455
Is it okay?

305
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,248
Bring a lobster to and
't is better than okay.

306
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,095
It is far. Can you swim well?

307
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,177
Well, I'm not very...
- She's a great swimmer.

308
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,575
I am not a good swimmer.
- Shut up.

309
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,329
Ok. Come on.

310
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,573
Ok.
- Great. Do you't fire?

311
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,293
Princess.

312
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,932
You know what really makes me bales?

313
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,570
I can not mourn
to my friends

314
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,255
because Zorro has a knife

315
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,332
and he wants to fuck my wife.

316
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,735
Do me a favor.
Pretend nothing

317
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,177
going on and keep him busy
on the reef

318
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,258
so I can mourn.
- Stop with your bullshit.

319
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,414
I am here
already 2 days longer than you.

320
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,770
So stop cutting.

321
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,978
Okay, I go diving. Stay here.

322
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,738
Stay away from the coral.

323
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,699
You'll cut you if you come out.

324
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,211
You have one. Fantastic.

325
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,657
How deep did you go?
- Twelve meters.

326
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,934
Want to see?
- Okay.

327
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,016
A shark. He is here.

328
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,017
It's okay. He'll do nothing.

329
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,409
You knew he was there, right?

330
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,058
I was just bitten.

331
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,057
Shows. Shows.

332
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,332
A jellyfish.
- It's painful.

333
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,337
You need to pee
to reduce the pain.

334
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,730
I can not
the back of my arm pee.

335
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,413
You need friends.

336
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,611
What have you done, Jack?

337
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,891
He had no need.

338
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,778
How can you do?

339
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,456
Easy. My feet bleed
and my head on fire.

340
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,736
Do you smoke cigars, Manuel?
There are still a lot.

341
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,658
No. Why did you move to the hut?

342
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,972
What do you think? Choose the boot
or hut. 's Whatever.

343
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,449
You should not do, Jack.

344
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,975
Should we all
creep in that cabin?

345
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,978
All right. I take the boat.
- Good choice.

346
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,738
You are not required, Manuel.
- Yes it is.

347
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,339
No, he built them. You built them.

348
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,134
'T even.
- We can take the boat.

349
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,570
What do you mean?
- Me?

350
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,289
You were not allowed to move
without eroverte talk.

351
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,368
That guy like you.
- And you had the captain not to dig.

352
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,378
That's disgusting.
- He like you, huh?

353
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,249
You want to make complicated...
- It's true.

354
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,337
...not, Jack?
- Not you?

355
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,809
He has saved my life.

356
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,093
He also saved yours.

357
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,416
Yes. But there is a difference.

358
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,373
Come on.

359
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,536
You can at least have some respect.

360
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,294
Why do you say me
what happened here?

361
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,214
Nothing happened.

362
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,010
's in your head. You and rejects it.

363
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,376
Yes?
- Yes, it's in your head.

364
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,615
What is that?
- I was bitten.

365
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,498
A jellyfish.

366
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,217
Good. Bad karma.

367
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,892
It hurts.

368
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,020
How are you?
- Good.

369
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,929
And you?
- Okay.

370
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,296
Sure? You look so disappointed.

371
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,457
From there he can not hear.

372
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,177
's Whatever.

373
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,852
He is stupid.

374
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,855
He thinks we have a relationship.

375
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,412
Maybe this should be so.

376
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,053
Why blame will
if we do not have fun?

377
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,932
Make no jokes about it.

378
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,493
I'm not kidding.

379
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,978
The food is ready.

380
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,854
Is that for me?
- Yes, let me do.

381
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,659
Not necessary.

382
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,056
With greetings from the captain.

383
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,294
Now we both
armed and dangerous.

384
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,730
Manuel said that he
studied for civil engineer.

385
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,295
State to Miami for 2 years.

386
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,813
With such a degree you can
a beautiful building strandhut...

387
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,653
You know, Jack,

388
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,328
I have enough of your bullshit.

389
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,573
Yes? And what will you do?

390
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,374
Why are you doing this?
- Do you really want to fight me?

391
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,292
What I want...

392
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,932
I want...

393
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,415
that you near
my wife continues!

394
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,971
Or I give you a plug.
- Jack! He has not touched me!

395
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,494
Hold on!
- No...

396
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,618
But that does not
I do not mind me.

397
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,416
Fucking arrogant beach gaper!
- Right.

398
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,696
This means no money.

399
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,573
You are a stupid gringo
itself can provide no food.

400
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,539
But I can cook.
Stay away from my fire!

401
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,293
Wil you big mouth design?

402
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,293
Can you stop?
- Hold your fire.

403
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,611
From now you can eat for sure.

404
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,453
I will do nothing to help you.

405
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,220
We have not needed.
- No?

406
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,776
Once we are here,
I will live to 'make a hell.

407
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,772
Beginning March pray
that they can quickly find.

408
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,052
Because I live you
to 'make a hell.

409
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,132
Great. Great!

410
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,934
That was... very stupid!

411
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,738
What do we do now?

412
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,819
You can not even find coconut.
Do you think he will give us food?

413
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,171
I...

414
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,057
I will provide food!

415
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,852
I will provide food!

416
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,933
Are you?

417
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,733
I got one.

418
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,851
That I do not eat.

419
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,095
I do...

420
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,131
We eat here anymore.

421
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,094
I am a prisoner!

422
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,817
Formidable! That is formidable!

423
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,659
Fine!

424
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,532
I go to the reef.

425
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,255
Here.

426
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,974
Without mask, you see nothing.
- Give me the knife.

427
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,139
For the second.

428
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,298
See you later.

429
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,812
Are you mad at me?
- No.

430
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,258
Would you like to eat?

431
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,978
I can not.

432
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,614
What do you mean?

433
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,456
I would feel
I him in the lurch.

434
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,736
Never mind. It is a fool.

435
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,573
It is my husband.
- He treats you bad.

436
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,215
Normally he does not.

437
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,008
Ok. Be a good wife.
What is it me?

438
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,250
He should not know what you do.
I will not say.

439
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,529
I trust you.
- Do you trust me?

440
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,375
Even when I swear in
's head of my mother?

441
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,738
Or perhaps, Manuel.

442
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,299
I swear the whole world
I will never say.

443
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,776
And if you give me a kiss,
I would not tell him.

444
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,814
Why do you say that?

445
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,375
Because I wanted to kiss you
the first time I saw you.

446
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,851
That's not fair, Manuel.
- Why do you say that?

447
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,410
It is never just a kiss.
- Do not worry.

448
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,415
You should not do what you do not want.
Just some food.

449
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,571
Promise that you will say nothing?

450
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,529
I would never hurt you.

451
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,533
Ok. I want a little bit.
- Okay.

452
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,973
Here.

453
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,052
Some juice?

454
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,013
Thank you.

455
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,176
Sorry for what happened.
- It's your fault.

456
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,250
What?
- You are cute.

457
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,335
No, actually.

458
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,254
Imagine how it would be
Jack and I were alone.

459
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,410
You would probably him
also a kiss questions.

460
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,136
Well. You can still laugh.

461
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,452
I see that you've already done.
- What?

462
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,371
You know.
- No.

463
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,455
It is better that I go.

464
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,094
Can I what?

465
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,173
For Jack?
- No.

466
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,855
I can't tell him. 's for me.

467
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,096
Yes. Take it.

468
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,892
Thank you.

469
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,132
You are welcome.

470
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,331
The next time
I make a whole meal.

471
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,059
I am right
on a decent kiss.

472
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,613
I started to make me worry about you.

473
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,772
I said you do not make fires.

474
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,972
It's okay. He is not.
He is on the other side of the island.

475
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,694
Have you spoken to him?
- Yes, I have him.

476
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,256
What did he say?
- He asked me if everything was okay.

477
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,530
Is that all?
- Yes.

478
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,016
Have you caught something?
- Yes.

479
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,897
Give me a cigarette?

480
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,131
There are there.
- What is that?

481
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,572
Fish.

482
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,010
What is that?
- What?

483
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,690
There. Similar to fish.

484
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,698
That's down from last time.
- The last time?

485
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,334
You think I'm going fishing
and I eat fish without you?

486
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,369
Many prisoners?
- Ignore him.

487
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,250
He gave him, huh?
- No.

488
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,539
Why did you fire then lit?
- To bake what you bring.

489
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,055
The yellow you can not eat.
They are poisonous.

490
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,690
Nobody asked your opinion.
- I try to be a good neighbor.

491
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,258
You lie to me?

492
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,015
You lie and he gives you food.

493
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,778
Okay, you want the truth, Jack?

494
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,214
I fish stolen from him.

495
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,378
I ate him and I
nothing left for you

496
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,808
because I knew
that you would respond.

497
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,136
You are going to restart again.

498
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,978
Manuel!
- Yes, Jack?

499
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,131
Did you know that my wife today
fish has stolen from you?

500
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,133
They do not need to steal.

501
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,138
If they want fish, I will give her.

502
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,609
Thank you.
- Sure.

503
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,293
Let us prepare what you have.

504
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,853
The yellow?

505
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,778
Why we will install our
what on the beach?

506
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,733
Away from the counter-flow,
on to the sand flies?

507
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,534
No, he should just leave.

508
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,017
We get rid of him. Damn.

509
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,568
Trap is not. Note.

510
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,255
You have to catch him at...
- That I do not get inside.

511
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,696
's war. Come on, tough guy.

512
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,650
That I do not get inside.
- It Looks bad, but it's good.

513
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,935
I will open one.

514
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,093
Beautiful, is not it?

515
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,093
Let's see if there are.
- Okay.

516
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,180
Why faded you fire?
- That I did not.

517
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,816
The bastard.
- No, Jack. Jack!

518
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,937
It's just a fire.

519
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,089
Hey! It is our fire!

520
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,457
You've stolen our fire, motherfucker.
- It is me. You have no.

521
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,571
Then we stole your lighter.
- That was not necessary.

522
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,216
It flew a spark on the island
and landed here!

523
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,690
Here? Here?

524
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,769
Jack! It's just fire.

525
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,612
Wil je't out, gringo?

526
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,817
Wil je't out?
- Give me that knife.

527
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,214
No!
- This is war.

528
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,694
Give me klotemes.
- Back, Jenny.

529
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,578
He has begun.

530
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,929
Through him we are here.

531
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,615
You're crazy, man.
- It does not matter who it is fire.

532
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,693
Saturday below decks when you 'fire began.
He was there.

533
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,329
You think I put the boat on fire
here with you to finish?

534
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,255
That is unbelievable.
- With me? No. Not with me.

535
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,415
Am I right?

536
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,531
Do you see each other.

537
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,612
You stole our fire,
I take fish.

538
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,058
Go ahead, take him.

539
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,376
You know how stupid you look?

540
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:10,410
You'll remember the taste
when you no longer have tomorrow.

541
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,415
Look at me not so, Manuel.

542
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,417
Stop it.

543
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,129
I do not eat more.

544
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,891
I want your girlfriend not.

545
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,096
I would not be your friend.

546
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,369
Who took my glasses?

547
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,816
I killed him.
I killed him, damn it!

548
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,176
He is hungry.
We have hunger.

549
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,331
He has requested it.
- Do you not?

550
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,697
I give him along. Let go.

551
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,940
I killed him.
- I give you your glasses back. Leave that.

552
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,289
Let me go.

553
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,298
Let me straight.

554
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,218
He will find out.

555
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,650
I do not care.

556
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,810
I can not do.

557
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,938
Come live with me.

558
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,456
I can not.

559
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,458
Why?

560
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,335
Promise me nothing to say.

561
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,178
Promise me you will keep silent.

562
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,011
Say nothing to him.
- Okay.

563
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,138
I promise it you.

564
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:37,696
But not only women
are good at it.

565
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,010
He will look in your eyes
and he will't know.

566
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,859
Why did you do it, if you knew?

567
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,853
Because I love you.

568
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,650
The wind enter them there.

569
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,735
Great.
- I got another one.

570
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,296
Suddenly came the shark
and scheurde him my harpoon.

571
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,095
't here are lots of sharks.
As in 'Jaws'.

572
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,770
The sharks were everywhere.

573
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,538
It was crazy.

574
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,537
I had the impression that I...

575
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:48,289
It wound me up. I
soup with venus shells

576
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,094
and I go to the woods to...

577
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,618
What?
- Nothing.

578
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,454
You did not remove his glasses.

579
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,731
He was furious. He wanted to murder you.

580
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,539
Well. Then he
how I felt.

581
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,773
We need him smoking

582
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,819
and store.
Do you see that handsome head...

583
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,138
The man and the fish?

584
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,212
And what did he say?

585
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,250
I told you already, he was furious.

586
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,898
He looks calm from now.

587
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,693
What has he done?

588
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,893
Nothing.

589
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,575
What have you done?

590
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,777
I told him that he was a fool,
Like I said to you.

591
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,292
I believe you.

592
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,411
Then I...

593
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,489
Tell me what happened here.
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

594
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,572
Did you gevrijd with him?

595
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,978
I can not believe I said that.

596
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,298
You gevrijd with him, right?

597
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,179
The worst scenario...

598
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,052
My God.

599
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,377
And now?

600
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,779
Go...

601
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,099
with them?
- No.

602
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,258
No?
You still love him

603
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:10,577
and me together.
Then you can 'borrow a cup of...

604
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,969
What do you want?

605
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,619
I want you to stop!

606
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,615
Watch what you want.

607
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,373
You will get what you deserve.

608
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,935
I want you to stop.

609
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,973
Okay, done.

610
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,774
's recent...

611
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,654
You have my heart broken. And...

612
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:38,170
you guys are together worth. And...

613
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,496
You're a big liar star.

614
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,689
And I want you...

615
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,532
leave. I think everything
it said. Go!

616
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,498
Look what I got caught.

617
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,171
Let him go.

618
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,658
You do not need.

619
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,053
He is still not back.

620
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,850
Why do you do?

621
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,013
You can not even
out of your head?

622
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,773
Or pretend he is not there?

623
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,977
You are crazy.
- He is not.

624
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,375
Let's dance.

625
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,453
Dancing?
- Yes.

626
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,578
Since I do not want.
- Okay, there's nothing to do.

627
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,174
We ruzieën all the time.

628
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,853
Let's dance.
- There is no music.

629
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,413
Then we make music.

630
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:42,693
Come on.

631
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,898
What happens?

632
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:43,498
I do not know.

633
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,696
It's like he just found.

634
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,139
it looks like a boat.

635
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,209
You have the sloop.

636
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,768
Let me help you.
- Reverse.

637
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,772
Let me help you.

638
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,254
He tries to help you, Jack.

639
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,650
He has already helped.

640
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,858
We try to help you
the island to leave Jack.

641
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,618
Let the sea make for you.

642
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,419
I'm good. Thank you.

643
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,458
So is Jack.

644
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,858
You never in your life
shared something with someone.

645
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,011
I still have you shared?

646
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,451
I was never yours.

647
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:32,529
Do you really
that you will get away?

648
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,128
This brings you to your end.

649
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,698
You do not know which way.
- North-northeast.

650
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:45,451
We are south-southwest.
I repair it and sail departure tomorrow.

651
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:50,535
So fast?
- Why? Not sure?

652
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,649
Everything is not as great as it seems?

653
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,619
Do not be cruel, Jack.
- Were you not cruel?

654
01:09:56,820 --> 01:10:00,256
I did what I had
to survive.

655
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:04,129
Ok. Then you also have to fuck me
in order to get here.

656
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,175
Is that all?

657
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,618
That would be a good start, baby.
- What do you mean?

658
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,737
Wil you that we love?

659
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,369
Immediately. Yes. Here.

660
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,373
Yes? Walk to the moon, Jack.

661
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:21,255
You wouldn't, even if you wanted.

662
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:25,973
You need a heart to forgive.
- What do you know about a heart?

663
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,650
He has been a rush to die.

664
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:43,331
He leaves tomorrow.
- Did he say?

665
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,898
You still talk to him.

666
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,773
Why not? It's a small island.

667
01:10:58,780 --> 01:10:59,929
Wil you go swimming?

668
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:02,611
's Nachts's beautiful.

669
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,176
And it is full Monday Great.

670
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,617
When you 're fishing, Manuel...

671
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,415
...she said that the next boat
wanted to leave.

672
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:15,574
And that they would do anything for.
- Nice try, Jack.

673
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:19,136
Ignore him. He lies.

674
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,973
Wil you still go swimming?

675
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,493
Come. I want you to swim.

676
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:32,940
The latest in the water must boil.
- That will do.

677
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:51,129
I said to you. It's beautiful.

678
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:53,333
Come on.

679
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,573
Let's take the boat
and leave him here.

680
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,456
Wil you?
- I would not stay any longer.

681
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,656
But he is not of that boat.

682
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:47,535
We can catch him when he sleeps.

683
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,337
And when he wakes up?

684
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,416
Can you do nothing?

685
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,539
Yes it is.

686
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,892
Wake up. Wake up.

687
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:24,173
What is wrong?

688
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,572
He is gone, go fishing.

689
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:29,248
If you want to go away, this is the moment.

690
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,774
Are you sure?
- Yes.

691
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,409
I checked the boat this morning.
He is ready. There is even a sail.

692
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:37,934
Come on.

693
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,052
Take the coconut them.

694
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,932
Stay there and push.
- He is coming.

695
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,579
Push!

696
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:21,490
Fast!

697
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,171
's gonna be fine. it will succeed.

698
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,415
Step into. Step into.

699
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:09,297
He went rampage like a screwball.
- It's a screwball.

700
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,019
Do you think he's only saves?

701
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:14,412
Can't care what you?
Why do you still busy?

702
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,537
I do not.

703
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:34,891
How long does it take
before we are back?

704
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:36,734
Maybe two days.

705
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:44,497
My God.
- What is it?

706
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:46,890
He leaks.
- Display.

707
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,649
I loose it, all right?

708
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:51,495
Can you do it?

709
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,731
Oh.
- What?

710
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:55,971
He has tampered with the boat
so that we would sink.

711
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,454
He is trying to murder us.

712
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:01,618
From the road. Let me see.
- Are we all well?

713
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,500
a few miles.
We have to swim.

714
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,213
I would not go back.

715
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,456
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

716
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,293
't have lasted longer
than I thought.

717
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,850
You tried to murder us, Jack.

718
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,499
How could you?

719
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,333
Where is he?

720
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:48,489
I do not know.

721
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:51,334
We became lost in each other's reef.

722
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,452
Jack, what are you doing?

723
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,652
Jack, stop it.

724
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,614
What are you planning?
- Say, buddy...

725
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,249
Was it a nice swim?
Shut up.

726
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,695
Was it a nice swim?

727
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,254
Everything okay?

728
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,413
Was it pleasant?

729
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:16,412
Come on, boy.

730
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,538
You are a coward, Jack!

731
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:40,614
You covered him while
he has my whole day swimming.

732
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:43,215
Everything can and everything goes.

733
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:52,537
To love and keep...

734
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:59,257
Respect and cherish...

735
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,532
In good and bad days...

736
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,056
Until death do us part.

737
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,738
Or something worse.

738
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,697
Are you familiar?

739
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,252
Amsterdam, 2001?

740
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,169
What did you not?

741
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:33,412
Not answers. a rhetorical question.

742
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:35,009
You know what I think?

743
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:40,215
Maybe you and I
for him to step up,

744
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:43,258
like you did for me.

745
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,209
Would not that be fun?

746
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,649
There are many possibilities.

747
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:55,298
Consider this as a concession.

748
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,370
Understand me well. There are 12 steps.

749
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,809
The first is...
a few crazy things.

750
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:55,488
Beat it, Manuel!

751
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,697
Come on. I care for you.

752
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,090
We must make the weapons.
- What?

753
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:38,690
Did you already? You have a fever.
- It does not.

754
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:39,896
No, we should hide.

755
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,178
No, I do not want to hide.
I want to fight.

756
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,612
I must fight against him.

757
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:48,053
Walk!

758
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:41,769
Are you ready to die out of love?

759
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,658
I am ready.

760
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:46,574
There is no edeler goal.
- Hold on, Jack!

761
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,811
Sooner or later someone comes along.

762
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:50,812
You will be accountable
for your actions.

763
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:54,371
My action?
- He can not fight. He is sick.

764
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,292
You made him sick.

765
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,133
I will teach him.

766
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:10,818
Leave him alone.

767
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,973
Stop it, Jack.

768
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:38,974
Someone built a hut here.

769
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,378
We're sorry, madam.
We wanted to not interfere.

770
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:51,211
We did not know that anybody was.
Is it?

771
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:55,573
Yes. 't Is. I can not believe
you there.

772
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:59,011
How long have you been here?
- A year, maybe longer.

773
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:01,695
Do you know what
with Maritani happened?

774
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,578
No, but we can
the ship's use.

775
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:06,169
Come on. I bring you there.
- Okay.

776
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:18,490
How are you here?
- I swam and I swam and I swam...

777
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,888
We have chocolate biscuits.
Would you?

778
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:47,132
Tell them that you let them.
- They're cute.

779
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:49,012
I thought you could use.

780
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,330
I enjoy every moment.

781
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:20,329
Wait!

782
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,615
Wait!
