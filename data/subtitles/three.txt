THR3E (2006)
They were expecting us
but this is ridiculous.
It looks like... Mardi Gras.
A good luck.
- Thanks.
Look. What do you think?
You are a cunning businesswoman.
Is this the boat?
- Yes.
The former Massachusetts.
Ideal for these waters.
Well done, Jack. He is beautiful.
M. Madsen...

And this is Bill.
Shy, slow, grumpy...

If he wants...
Note the small ones.
There is a laptop.
I know what you think. Stout!
My God.
What happens?
This will leave traces.
Damn.
- Jack... difficult you do not.
She is right. Keep your outside.
That was strange.
Let's just eat.
There he goes again.

They were gay.
- But no. You imagine you in.
More than that even. They were so...
Damn.
Manny, bring a bottle.
Tonight we celebrate.
Health.
- At us. And the rest of the pot.
Our...
- And the rest of the pot!
Take a glass, Manny.
No, thanks.
Tough day at the port?
- Excuse me?
The señorita is difficult?
Drink a glass with us.
A little. What I am concerned,
does wonders.
Need anything?
No, everything okay. Thank you.
You had nothing to say, Jack.
- This guy is an idiot.
I have to lose.
For me is roads
on the quay as a Marlin.
I would you could tear.
- No, too late.
I have a headache.
Have a beer.
As in the good old days.

Who says it's a 'he' is?
What would they do?
Not...
He call all the whole morning.
He makes me crazy.
Someone watch it on us.
Shall I tell him something?
- No.
Do we understand each other? Buy, okay?
A moment.
Manuel, have you seen him?
He makes some Margarita's ready.
We wait for 20 minutes on the beers.
's Problem, M. Madsen?
Yes. We are still awaiting the beers.
Immediately, señor.
I'll call you back.
- Señoras.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I do not like the attitude
that guy.
I care for it. Keep this course.
You provoke them. I see it.
- It provokes me.
It's a customer!
He gave a lot of money.
He has respect for anyone.
If you do not handle,
you can go.
Okay, I go.
Okay, you go off at the next port.
What happens?
Place ice cream and beer to top.
What is the problem, Manuel?
That is the problem.
Do what he asks.
- Do it yourself.
You have one.
Get him inside.
No, no. Let him go.
Do not do everything at once.
I hope they do not
to bring here.
Margarita Are there no more?
What will they do?
- Striking until he is dead.
Throw him back.
My God. Smoke.
Captain!
We have a problem above.
What happens?
- Everything is on fire.
Damn. Look how big he is.
Help us!
Manny, Evacuate passengers.
We leave the boat!
In the life review.
We can reach anyone!
It failed!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
- Attention.
I have found him.
He floated in the water.
My God!
Still others seen?
Seen Jack?
I can not believe it.
It is so cold.
I have huge cold.
It's okay. It is good.
Good day.
Thank you
have kept me warm tonight.
You did the same with me.
How long will it take
before they come looking for us?
They do not yet know
that we are missing.
Yes, but when they hear...
It can take weeks,
maybe months.
We are not in Miami.
It seems that the
you can not care what happens.
I am glad that I am still alive.
Wil you?
Is there anything else?
If lunch or dinner?
- No, I... in general.
Maybe catch, I got lucky.
Can we really no fire lighting?
With what?
- No idea.
You mask. The rock.
The knife. You can see it in movies.
There are no increases in glass.
And you will find no flint.
How do you know?
- Because I live in such a place.
You think I do not want to fire?
- No, no.
Excuse me.
We have a house built.
A house?
How are you?
I have pain everywhere.
Have you seen something?
Nothing.
We go swimming in the dark.
As clever of you.
And my blisters?
- It will be good to do.
Come on.
Leave your clothes on the beach.
You do not want to sleep in wet clothes.
Come on! There is none.
- You are there.
I do not see what it matters.
We have slept together.
Come on, I will turn a blind eye.
Do not look.
It is very pleasant.
See? You must learn to trust me.
Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Why did you get that girl beaten
on the quay?
You look not a guy out.
They forced me to it.
- Haart store?
Yes. They hit me. They tamped me.
She made me ridiculous
for my friends.
Why did she do that?
- No idea.
Because she refuses
its problems.
She wants me to blame.
And she wants to punish me.
What problems have they?
She is pregnant.
Or that she says.
She wants to marry me.
But I refused.
Is she not a virgin?
Were you a virgin when you married?
That does not matter.
- Reply.
It is your business.
- I understand.
You want to know everything about my life,
but you said nothing about yours.
You work with two weights.
What are you talking about?
You like your man.
You're rich and you think
ways than the rest.
That is not true.
You do not know what I think.
You act stupid.
- Dom?
You think? Listen...
you can only survive
I eat because you give and for your concern.
I would not hear.
Wil you turn?
Smart ass, Señora!
A perfectly formed heart.
Then maybe God
you do not really heart it.
You sleep?
My mother did that with my father
when I was little.
They punished him doorte silence.
You know what he said to me?
"Pretend you're sad
and enjoy the silence. "
If you have cold,
put you against me.
Go fish?
- Near the reef.
Is not it dangerous?
- The best place for lobster.
What do you think?
From what?
Everything.
I do not want more
you argue, Manuel.
I would also not
argue with you, Señora.
Call me Jenny. Not "Señora".
Okay, Jenny.
Can we be friends?
- We are friends.
We sleep together. Have you forgotten?
You know where you are?
You know who I am?
Jenny!
Jack?
Where were you? Where did you find him?
- On the reef.
Is it? What have you done?
Calm down.
- Okay.
We are almost there.
Bye, honey.
I love you.
What took you so long as?
Put it here.
Jack, put you down, baby.
What? What is it?
- Not in my back.
Here is water.
Here, honey. Drink water.
I thought I had lost you.
Stop, dear...
- Thanks. Thank you.
Drink water.
Let me, honey.
I missed you.
I must lie down.
Let me.
He sleeps.
He seems not to remember.
He needed rest, nothing more.
Are you hungry?
- Yes.
Thanks you have saved him.
I had it almost done.
Just kidding.
Someone a hot breakfast?
How did you do that?
- What?
The fire lit?
- Oh, that.
I have two pieces of wood
rubbed against each other.
As they do with the scouts.
Unbelievable.
We were not successful.
And I could not catch lobster.
Where did they find?
- On the reef.
And you need glasses.
What sticks do you use?
It is not a native flora...
You cheated. I knew it.
You are a small child.
Good to see that you feel good.
- It's nice that I feel something.
And Bill and Gail?
I would not talk about.
But you were not silent.
I am... I... you know...
You have a cabin built.
Is there a tank? There is...
Manuel did't. I just helped.
Good work. I am builder
and I am impressed.
It smells good, baby.
Yes. Enter.
What do you want?
- I want to open.
Let me.
You trust me with a knife.
I want to keep sharp.
Boring.
Here.
Here.
Wil je?
Go ahead. I go swimming first.
He was so sweet.
- Yes?
it seems that he is good fun.
What do you mean?
- Come on.
It looks like the Blue Lagoon.
And I see no separate rooms.
Stop, Jack.
- "He was so sweet. "
We have been trying for 2 days to survive.
We had no time
to build a Hilton.
But you had time to
's wedding suite building.
Where are you going?
- I go swimming.
Go. Great.
All children love.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
I'm tired.
I am sad. I am angry.
I'm grumpy.
And... I, I, I, I...
And I'm sorry.
We must agree.
Only in this way we come here.
You're right. Easy to...
Stop to enjoy. Okay?
Does he know where we are?
- No.
Have you seen airplanes?
- No.
A boat?
Cargo ships. Corridors. Nothing?
No, nothing.
- Have you fucked him?
Yes.
- Good.
He is great.
- He is handsome.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
This fluid is
flavors to waste
and other
contain no liquid.
Take the more mature if you want
they are juicy.
Why a mask?
Mask.
No idea. He had him
when we arrived.
You think that strange?
The boat is on fire
and he thinks it a mask to take?
Maybe he was in his pocket.
Perhaps he was glad to see you.
- Very nice...
You make ridiculous.
- Oh, really?
How did it go?
The water is cloudy.
And the reef?
Too wild. I can not hold
what I collect.
Why do not you come?
- I have no sense.
Is it okay?
Bring a lobster to and
't is better than okay.
It is far. Can you swim well?
Well, I'm not very...
- She's a great swimmer.
I am not a good swimmer.
- Shut up.
Ok. Come on.
Ok.
- Great. Do you't fire?
Princess.
You know what really makes me bales?
I can not mourn
to my friends
because Zorro has a knife
and he wants to fuck my wife.
Do me a favor.
Pretend nothing
going on and keep him busy
on the reef
so I can mourn.
- Stop with your bullshit.
I am here
already 2 days longer than you.
So stop cutting.
Okay, I go diving. Stay here.
Stay away from the coral.
You'll cut you if you come out.
You have one. Fantastic.
How deep did you go?
- Twelve meters.
Want to see?
- Okay.
A shark. He is here.
It's okay. He'll do nothing.
You knew he was there, right?
I was just bitten.
Shows. Shows.
A jellyfish.
- It's painful.
You need to pee
to reduce the pain.
I can not
the back of my arm pee.
You need friends.
What have you done, Jack?
He had no need.
How can you do?
Easy. My feet bleed
and my head on fire.
Do you smoke cigars, Manuel?
There are still a lot.
No. Why did you move to the hut?
What do you think? Choose the boot
or hut. 's Whatever.
You should not do, Jack.
Should we all
creep in that cabin?
All right. I take the boat.
- Good choice.
You are not required, Manuel.
- Yes it is.
No, he built them. You built them.
'T even.
- We can take the boat.
What do you mean?
- Me?
You were not allowed to move
without eroverte talk.
That guy like you.
- And you had the captain not to dig.
That's disgusting.
- He like you, huh?
You want to make complicated...
- It's true.
...not, Jack?
- Not you?
He has saved my life.
He also saved yours.
Yes. But there is a difference.
Come on.
You can at least have some respect.
Why do you say me
what happened here?
Nothing happened.
's in your head. You and rejects it.
Yes?
- Yes, it's in your head.
What is that?
- I was bitten.
A jellyfish.
Good. Bad karma.
It hurts.
How are you?
- Good.
And you?
- Okay.
Sure? You look so disappointed.
From there he can not hear.
's Whatever.
He is stupid.
He thinks we have a relationship.
Maybe this should be so.
Why blame will
if we do not have fun?
Make no jokes about it.
I'm not kidding.
The food is ready.
Is that for me?
- Yes, let me do.
Not necessary.
With greetings from the captain.
Now we both
armed and dangerous.
Manuel said that he
studied for civil engineer.
State to Miami for 2 years.
With such a degree you can
a beautiful building strandhut...
You know, Jack,
I have enough of your bullshit.
Yes? And what will you do?
Why are you doing this?
- Do you really want to fight me?
What I want...
I want...
that you near
my wife continues!
Or I give you a plug.
- Jack! He has not touched me!
Hold on!
- No...
But that does not
I do not mind me.
Fucking arrogant beach gaper!
- Right.
This means no money.
You are a stupid gringo
itself can provide no food.
But I can cook.
Stay away from my fire!
Wil you big mouth design?
Can you stop?
- Hold your fire.
From now you can eat for sure.
I will do nothing to help you.
We have not needed.
- No?
Once we are here,
I will live to 'make a hell.
Beginning March pray
that they can quickly find.
Because I live you
to 'make a hell.
Great. Great!
That was... very stupid!
What do we do now?
You can not even find coconut.
Do you think he will give us food?
I...
I will provide food!
I will provide food!
Are you?
I got one.
That I do not eat.
I do...
We eat here anymore.
I am a prisoner!
Formidable! That is formidable!
Fine!
I go to the reef.
Here.
Without mask, you see nothing.
- Give me the knife.
For the second.
See you later.
Are you mad at me?
- No.
Would you like to eat?
I can not.
What do you mean?
I would feel
I him in the lurch.
Never mind. It is a fool.
It is my husband.
- He treats you bad.
Normally he does not.
Ok. Be a good wife.
What is it me?
He should not know what you do.
I will not say.
I trust you.
- Do you trust me?
Even when I swear in
's head of my mother?
Or perhaps, Manuel.
I swear the whole world
I will never say.
And if you give me a kiss,
I would not tell him.
Why do you say that?
Because I wanted to kiss you
the first time I saw you.
That's not fair, Manuel.
- Why do you say that?
It is never just a kiss.
- Do not worry.
You should not do what you do not want.
Just some food.
Promise that you will say nothing?
I would never hurt you.
Ok. I want a little bit.
- Okay.
Here.
Some juice?
Thank you.
Sorry for what happened.
- It's your fault.
What?
- You are cute.
No, actually.
Imagine how it would be
Jack and I were alone.
You would probably him
also a kiss questions.
Well. You can still laugh.
I see that you've already done.
- What?
You know.
- No.
It is better that I go.
Can I what?
For Jack?
- No.
I can't tell him. 's for me.
Yes. Take it.
Thank you.
You are welcome.
The next time
I make a whole meal.
I am right
on a decent kiss.
I started to make me worry about you.
I said you do not make fires.
It's okay. He is not.
He is on the other side of the island.
Have you spoken to him?
- Yes, I have him.
What did he say?
- He asked me if everything was okay.
Is that all?
- Yes.
Have you caught something?
- Yes.
Give me a cigarette?
There are there.
- What is that?
Fish.
What is that?
- What?
There. Similar to fish.
That's down from last time.
- The last time?
You think I'm going fishing
and I eat fish without you?
Many prisoners?
- Ignore him.
He gave him, huh?
- No.
Why did you fire then lit?
- To bake what you bring.
The yellow you can not eat.
They are poisonous.
Nobody asked your opinion.
- I try to be a good neighbor.
You lie to me?
You lie and he gives you food.
Okay, you want the truth, Jack?
I fish stolen from him.
I ate him and I
nothing left for you
because I knew
that you would respond.
You are going to restart again.
Manuel!
- Yes, Jack?
Did you know that my wife today
fish has stolen from you?
They do not need to steal.
If they want fish, I will give her.
Thank you.
- Sure.
Let us prepare what you have.
The yellow?
Why we will install our
what on the beach?
Away from the counter-flow,
on to the sand flies?
No, he should just leave.
We get rid of him. Damn.
Trap is not. Note.
You have to catch him at...
- That I do not get inside.
's war. Come on, tough guy.
That I do not get inside.
- It Looks bad, but it's good.
I will open one.
Beautiful, is not it?
Let's see if there are.
- Okay.
Why faded you fire?
- That I did not.
The bastard.
- No, Jack. Jack!
It's just a fire.
Hey! It is our fire!
You've stolen our fire, motherfucker.
- It is me. You have no.
Then we stole your lighter.
- That was not necessary.
It flew a spark on the island
and landed here!
Here? Here?
Jack! It's just fire.
Wil je't out, gringo?
Wil je't out?
- Give me that knife.
No!
- This is war.
Give me klotemes.
- Back, Jenny.
He has begun.
Through him we are here.
You're crazy, man.
- It does not matter who it is fire.
Saturday below decks when you 'fire began.
He was there.
You think I put the boat on fire
here with you to finish?
That is unbelievable.
- With me? No. Not with me.
Am I right?
Do you see each other.
You stole our fire,
I take fish.
Go ahead, take him.
You know how stupid you look?
You'll remember the taste
when you no longer have tomorrow.
Look at me not so, Manuel.
Stop it.
I do not eat more.
I want your girlfriend not.
I would not be your friend.
Who took my glasses?
I killed him.
I killed him, damn it!
He is hungry.
We have hunger.
He has requested it.
- Do you not?
I give him along. Let go.
I killed him.
- I give you your glasses back. Leave that.
Let me go.
Let me straight.
He will find out.
I do not care.
I can not do.
Come live with me.
I can not.
Why?
Promise me nothing to say.
Promise me you will keep silent.
Say nothing to him.
- Okay.
I promise it you.
But not only women
are good at it.
He will look in your eyes
and he will't know.
Why did you do it, if you knew?
Because I love you.
The wind enter them there.
Great.
- I got another one.
Suddenly came the shark
and scheurde him my harpoon.
't here are lots of sharks.
As in 'Jaws'.
The sharks were everywhere.
It was crazy.
I had the impression that I...
It wound me up. I
soup with venus shells
and I go to the woods to...
What?
- Nothing.
You did not remove his glasses.
He was furious. He wanted to murder you.
Well. Then he
how I felt.
We need him smoking
and store.
Do you see that handsome head...
The man and the fish?
And what did he say?
I told you already, he was furious.
He looks calm from now.
What has he done?
Nothing.
What have you done?
I told him that he was a fool,
Like I said to you.
I believe you.
Then I...
Tell me what happened here.
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Did you gevrijd with him?
I can not believe I said that.
You gevrijd with him, right?
The worst scenario...
My God.
And now?
Go...
with them?
- No.
No?
You still love him
and me together.
Then you can 'borrow a cup of...
What do you want?
I want you to stop!
Watch what you want.
You will get what you deserve.
I want you to stop.
Okay, done.
's recent...
You have my heart broken. And...
you guys are together worth. And...
You're a big liar star.
And I want you...
leave. I think everything
it said. Go!
Look what I got caught.
Let him go.
You do not need.
He is still not back.
Why do you do?
You can not even
out of your head?
Or pretend he is not there?
You are crazy.
- He is not.
Let's dance.
Dancing?
- Yes.
Since I do not want.
- Okay, there's nothing to do.
We ruzieën all the time.
Let's dance.
- There is no music.
Then we make music.
Come on.
What happens?
I do not know.
It's like he just found.
it looks like a boat.
You have the sloop.
Let me help you.
- Reverse.
Let me help you.
He tries to help you, Jack.
He has already helped.
We try to help you
the island to leave Jack.
Let the sea make for you.
I'm good. Thank you.
So is Jack.
You never in your life
shared something with someone.
I still have you shared?
I was never yours.
Do you really
that you will get away?
This brings you to your end.
You do not know which way.
- North-northeast.
We are south-southwest.
I repair it and sail departure tomorrow.
So fast?
- Why? Not sure?
Everything is not as great as it seems?
Do not be cruel, Jack.
- Were you not cruel?
I did what I had
to survive.
Ok. Then you also have to fuck me
in order to get here.
Is that all?
That would be a good start, baby.
- What do you mean?
Wil you that we love?
Immediately. Yes. Here.
Yes? Walk to the moon, Jack.
You wouldn't, even if you wanted.
You need a heart to forgive.
- What do you know about a heart?
He has been a rush to die.
He leaves tomorrow.
- Did he say?
You still talk to him.
Why not? It's a small island.
Wil you go swimming?
's Nachts's beautiful.
And it is full Monday Great.
When you 're fishing, Manuel...
...she said that the next boat
wanted to leave.
And that they would do anything for.
- Nice try, Jack.
Ignore him. He lies.
Wil you still go swimming?
Come. I want you to swim.
The latest in the water must boil.
- That will do.
I said to you. It's beautiful.
Come on.
Let's take the boat
and leave him here.
Wil you?
- I would not stay any longer.
But he is not of that boat.
We can catch him when he sleeps.
And when he wakes up?
Can you do nothing?
Yes it is.
Wake up. Wake up.
What is wrong?
He is gone, go fishing.
If you want to go away, this is the moment.
Are you sure?
- Yes.
I checked the boat this morning.
He is ready. There is even a sail.
Come on.
Take the coconut them.
Stay there and push.
- He is coming.
Push!
Fast!
's gonna be fine. it will succeed.
Step into. Step into.
He went rampage like a screwball.
- It's a screwball.
Do you think he's only saves?
Can't care what you?
Why do you still busy?
I do not.
How long does it take
before we are back?
Maybe two days.
My God.
- What is it?
He leaks.
- Display.
I loose it, all right?
Can you do it?
Oh.
- What?
He has tampered with the boat
so that we would sink.
He is trying to murder us.
From the road. Let me see.
- Are we all well?
a few miles.
We have to swim.
I would not go back.
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.
't have lasted longer
than I thought.
You tried to murder us, Jack.
How could you?
Where is he?
I do not know.
We became lost in each other's reef.
Jack, what are you doing?
Jack, stop it.
What are you planning?
- Say, buddy...
Was it a nice swim?
Shut up.
Was it a nice swim?
Everything okay?
Was it pleasant?
Come on, boy.
You are a coward, Jack!
You covered him while
he has my whole day swimming.
Everything can and everything goes.
To love and keep...
Respect and cherish...
In good and bad days...
Until death do us part.
Or something worse.
Are you familiar?
Amsterdam, 2001?
What did you not?
Not answers. a rhetorical question.
You know what I think?
Maybe you and I
for him to step up,
like you did for me.
Would not that be fun?
There are many possibilities.
Consider this as a concession.
Understand me well. There are 12 steps.
The first is...
a few crazy things.
Beat it, Manuel!
Come on. I care for you.
We must make the weapons.
- What?
Did you already? You have a fever.
- It does not.
No, we should hide.
No, I do not want to hide.
I want to fight.
I must fight against him.
Walk!
Are you ready to die out of love?
I am ready.
There is no edeler goal.
- Hold on, Jack!
Sooner or later someone comes along.
You will be accountable
for your actions.
My action?
- He can not fight. He is sick.
You made him sick.
I will teach him.
Leave him alone.
Stop it, Jack.
Someone built a hut here.
We're sorry, madam.
We wanted to not interfere.
We did not know that anybody was.
Is it?
Yes. 't Is. I can not believe
you there.
How long have you been here?
- A year, maybe longer.
Do you know what
with Maritani happened?
No, but we can
the ship's use.
Come on. I bring you there.
- Okay.
How are you here?
- I swam and I swam and I swam...
