2
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,826
I'm inviting you for breakfast.

3
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:14,125
I can't.
I have to go to church.

4
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:20,840
Well, after church then.

5
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:23,759
Come on,
we haven't seen you for so long.

6
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,345
Why don't you put this on,
because

7
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,807
I don't want your little baby
to get sick.

8
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,017
It's so cold out.

9
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:38,398
- Come on!
- Okay.

10
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:42,485
Okay?

11
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,448
You'll come?

12
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:48,617
Oh, yeah.

13
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,953
Great!

14
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:55,916
- Could you put the whole thing on?
- Oh, yeah. - Okay.

15
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,125
See you.

16
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,812
You owe me five dollars.

17
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:25,860
Not till he's sitting at the table.
I don't owe you anything yet.

18
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,949
Something's going on with him.
I'm worried.

19
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,952
You keep saying that.
I think your...

20
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:37,622
Your maternal instincts
might be kicking in.

21
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:46,129
In all the world,

22
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:50,717
there are books and books
and books of laws.

23
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:56,056
But in all this world,
there really is only one Lord.

24
00:03:57,183 --> 00:04:01,311
We need never ask:
"Lord, what should I do?",

25
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:05,315
because the Lord
has told us what to do.

26
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,235
"Love one another."

27
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:13,656
That, my friends,
is the one true law.

28
00:04:14,032 --> 00:04:17,952
Love is God in action.

29
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:21,539
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the love of God,

30
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:25,710
the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
be with you all now and forever more.

31
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:28,129
- Amen.
- Amen.

32
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:36,803
Hi, Mrs. Gruner.
Do you want some help?

33
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:39,097
- Thank you, dear.
- Okay.

34
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:43,143
It's my turn
to drop them off at the hospital.

35
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:49,024
You're a good-looking fellow, Lars.

36
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:50,859
Where's your girlfriend?

37
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:52,527
I don't have one.

38
00:04:52,987 --> 00:04:54,446
- Are you gay?
- No.

39
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,198
My grandson's gay,
I know all about the gays.

40
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:59,242
I know, but I'm not gay, so...

41
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:04,038
- Well, don't leave it too long.
It's not good for you. - Okay.

42
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,374
Here.

43
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:11,045
Give this to somebody nice.

44
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:12,588
For a start.

45
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:18,260
Hello, Lars.

46
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,651
I guess...

47
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:37,904
- I'll see you at work tomorrow.
- Yeah, okay. Bye.

48
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:44,869
Karin, my brother is 27-years-old.
Maybe he wants to be left alone.

49
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:47,705
- That's not what he wants.
- Really? Hey, just...

50
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,833
Go.
How do you know that exactly?

51
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:54,253
Because that's not how people are.

52
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:58,215
There he goes.

53
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,056
Lars! Come on, you promised!

54
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:16,274
- Is that normal?
- Five dollars.

55
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:01,484
Morning!

56
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:02,986
Good morning, Cindy.

57
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:04,904
Did you have a nice weekend?

58
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:08,991
That new girl's kind of cute, huh?

59
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:12,328
You and Margo!
What do you think?

60
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:26,634
Lars, you've got to see this!

61
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:29,595
I'm not really in the mood
for porn this morning.

62
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:30,720
It's not porn.

63
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,808
Okay, it is,
but check it out, alright?

64
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:40,855
You like?
Man, it's solid!

65
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:45,235
If she'd weigh 125 pounds,
then she weighs 125 pounds.

66
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,361
Is that right?

67
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:50,365
You can customize everything.
They've got different heads and parts.

68
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:52,325
You can design your own woman!

69
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,244
And, Lars...

70
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:57,621
- Lars!
- Yeah?

71
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,251
They're anatomically correct.

72
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,509
You aren't going to buy one, are you?

73
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,052
I wish.

74
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:16,265
Look how much they cost.
I'm wiped out from the X-box.

75
00:08:17,516 --> 00:08:19,058
Morning.

76
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:23,312
- Morning!
- Oh, hey! Yeah. Morning!

77
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:25,898
Margo's here, everybody!
Hurray!

78
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:32,738
Could you put the headset on?

79
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:41,205
I was thinking,

80
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,958
we're the only ones from the lake.
We could carpool.

81
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,169
Lars, it's your day for coffee, buddy.

82
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:49,754
Oh, yeah.

83
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:57,596
You know what your problem is?
You're just too aggressive.

84
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,058
- Just chillax, you know?
- Shut up.

85
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,318
Wait. Stop.

86
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:13,485
Stop!

87
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:18,115
Karin! What? What?

88
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:21,285
We want you to come for dinner.

89
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,206
Will you come?

90
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:34,505
You scared me.

91
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,217
- Sorry! Sorry.
- You scared me.

92
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,427
Oh, sweetheart. Sorry.

93
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,596
Wait.

94
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:45,892
- It's okay. I can't. I can't.
- Why not? No!

95
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,354
Why not?
Come on, Lars, we miss you.

96
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:56,986
I brought my work home, so I have to...
I'll get in trouble.

97
00:09:58,112 --> 00:09:59,238
No, you didn't.

98
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:01,573
Did you hear that?
That's my phone, I think.

99
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:04,952
No, come on, wait! Wait!
Lars! Stop! Stop!

100
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:11,500
- Come on, please?
- I have other plans.

101
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:13,544
And I can't.

102
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:18,215
Lars, there's salmon
and cherry pie in there.

103
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:23,762
- Could you please let me go?
- No.

104
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,057
Okay.

105
00:10:43,407 --> 00:10:45,032
Is that all you can eat?

106
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,743
- Yeah, that was delicious. Thank you.
- Okay.

107
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,412
No, no, you stay there.
No, it's my turn.

108
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:52,914
You boys talk.

109
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:04,509
Okay...
Karin's been worried about you.

110
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:08,513
She thinks you've got a problem because
you spend so much time by yourself.

111
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:13,392
I'm fine.

112
00:11:13,727 --> 00:11:16,812
That's what I told her.
That's exactly what I said.

113
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:19,106
Okay.

114
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:22,401
Dad was kind of like that too, so...

115
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:27,114
Yeah, but he didn't want
anyone around. That's the difference.

116
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:30,701
That's not true.

117
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:37,416
Okay. You know? Yeah, sure,
maybe after mom died,

118
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,752
but you didn't even know him
before that. So...

119
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:45,882
I mean, not that you could have,
but I'm just saying...

120
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:02,315
Karin and I would really like it
if you moved in.

121
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:07,110
No, that's okay. Thank you.

122
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:09,112
The house is half yours.

123
00:12:09,322 --> 00:12:11,406
I know, but I'm fine, thanks.

124
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:14,743
I'm just putting it out there.

125
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:22,292
- Well, goodnight. Sleep tight.
- Goodnight.

126
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:25,796
Wait.
Here's some leftovers for you.

127
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:28,089
Do you have my blanket?

128
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:31,676
- Oh, yeah. It's on the...
- I'll get it. Grab these.

129
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,970
I'll be right back.

130
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:39,225
It's a beautiful blanket.

131
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:42,728
- Gus says your mother made it for you.
- Yeah.

132
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,313
When she was pregnant.

133
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:51,571
She must have loved you very much,
like we do.

134
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,371
- Are you mad at me?
- Is he coming?

135
00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:05,208
- Here we go. - Goodnight.
- Thanks. Goodnight.

136
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:15,051
What?

137
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:16,803
We talked, he's fine.

138
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:44,954
6 weeks later...

139
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:01,137
- Hello?
- Hey, Lars. It's Karin.

140
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:03,556
They just delivered
a huge box for you.

141
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,016
It's in the garage.

142
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:10,145
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay, bye.

143
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:12,272
Thanks.

144
00:15:11,831 --> 00:15:13,582
That's a nice sweater.

145
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:31,348
Hey!

146
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,517
Come on in.

147
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:40,649
That's okay.
Is Karin gonna come to the door?

148
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:41,984
Karin!

149
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:43,569
Yeah?

150
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:45,571
Honey, come here, it's Lars!

151
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,156
- Really?
- Yeah.

152
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:53,786
She's just doing some kind of...

153
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,123
It's pregnant women's yoga.

154
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,587
No, it's good.
It's good, good stuff.

155
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,005
- Hey.
- Hi.

156
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,340
What's up?

157
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,136
I have a visitor.

158
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,765
- You have?
- In the garage?

159
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,725
- Now?
- Yeah.

160
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,393
A visitor?

161
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,104
That's great!

162
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,524
Yeah.

163
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,276
And she's not from here.

164
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,903
She?

165
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,530
Yeah.

166
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,699
Wow, what do you know?

167
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,036
Where did you meet this person?

168
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,789
- On the Internet.
- Yeah, everybody's doing that now.

169
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,083
That's great!

170
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,170
She doesn't speak much English, though.

171
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,174
That's okay.
It's the same with the guys at work.

172
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,094
- It's not that big a deal.
- Okay.

173
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,723
Oh, yeah.
You know, she's in a wheelchair,

174
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,226
so I don't want her
to feel weird about it.

175
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,394
- We don't care.
- Oh, no. No.

176
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:03,603
Okay.

177
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:07,899
And I have to ask you a really...
I know it's a really big favor.

178
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:10,110
Yeah.

179
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:14,823
Well...
She's really religious and,

180
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:17,200
because we're both young and single,

181
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:20,662
it doesn't feel right for us
to stay in the garage alone together.

182
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:22,956
No.
We'll put her in the pink room.

183
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,667
- She could sleep here.
- In the pink room? - Yeah!

184
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,794
- Okay.
- Sure! And there are new towels.

185
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:35,050
Just give us half an hour to pick up

186
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,344
and get something in the oven.

187
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:39,638
- Okey-dokey.
- Let's get the place ready.

188
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,312
Okay. Let's get started!

189
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:50,482
Man, that is...

190
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:55,361
You quiet ones...
You know what they say.

191
00:17:56,739 --> 00:18:00,033
It's great. It's great.
See you in a little bit.

192
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:01,826
- Okay.
- Okay.

193
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:27,684
You know, Bianca's a missionary.

194
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,729
Was a missionary.
Right, sorry.

195
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,231
She was raised by nuns.

196
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:35,150
But now she's on a sabbatical,
she can experience the world.

197
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:36,401
Isn't that neat?

198
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,450
She's shy.

199
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,703
Well, you are.

200
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:50,498
Everything's so new

201
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,626
for her. Right?

202
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,218
- Are you hungry?
- We're starving.

203
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,972
Gus, will you give me
a hand in the kitchen?

204
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:14,646
How was that?

205
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:17,357
I know.

206
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:21,319
He's out of his mind.

207
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:25,115
Oh, my God!

208
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:28,910
It seems crazy, right?
I mean, he's crazy!

209
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:34,582
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. - What are we gonna do?

210
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:39,336
Oh, my God!

211
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:42,214
We have to put him in a hospital,
I think.

212
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,758
We have to put him in a hospital,
I can't afford that.

213
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:48,637
Karin, I can't believe this.
My little brother is totally insane!

214
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:51,182
- Pull yourself together.
- How am I? - Gus!

215
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:54,143
- Calm down! - How can I?
- Calm down, okay? Now!

216
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,727
He's talking to a doll!

217
00:19:56,854 --> 00:19:59,147
We've just got to get
through this somehow, okay?

218
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,608
- I don't know how we're gonna
do that. - Me neither.

219
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:03,318
But you've gotta be calm.

220
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:05,403
Okay?

221
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:07,113
Okay.

222
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,701
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

223
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,249
Karin, she's not gonna eat!

224
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:49,654
You're never gonna believe this.

225
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,323
It makes me mad.

226
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:54,826
Bianca's from the tropics.

227
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,411
She's Brazilian.

228
00:20:58,872 --> 00:21:02,041
Well, half Brazilian, half Danish,
that's right.

229
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:07,213
And somebody stole her luggage.

230
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:12,342
Yeah!
And they stole her wheelchair.

231
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:17,848
That's terrible.

232
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,434
Yeah!
Can you believe that, Gus?

233
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:24,688
- Yeah, I can't believe it.
- Right.

234
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:30,694
Well, it makes me angry.
Anyway...

235
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:37,908
I wanted to ask you a favor.
She doesn't mind, I promise.

236
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:42,204
Karin, would you mind lending Bianca
some clothes? She doesn't have any.

237
00:21:54,718 --> 00:21:55,759
Do you?

238
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:58,429
I'm not sure we're the same type, Lars.

239
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:00,763
That's okay, Karin, because

240
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:04,976
Bianca doesn't care about superficial
things like that, so it's okay.

241
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:16,529
- Sure.
- Yeah, that's right.

242
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:20,116
See? I told you.
Thanks.

243
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:27,831
This used to be my mom's room.
So...

244
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,752
If you need anything,
Gus and Karin are across the hall.

245
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,378
I'm in the garage.

246
00:22:34,923 --> 00:22:37,424
You know that, so what else?

247
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:41,428
Your towels are brand-new,
thanks to Karin.

248
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:47,267
Lars, I think we should go to bed.

249
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:48,518
Oh, okay.

250
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,854
Just one second.

251
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,108
I just wanted to say
I'm so glad you're finally here.

252
00:22:57,694 --> 00:22:59,987
I think right now...

253
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,366
Yeah. Okay, goodnight.

254
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,962
Wait!
Gus had a good idea.

255
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:21,341
He's concerned about Bianca's health.

256
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:26,346
You know, with the traveling,
the change of climate, and everything...

257
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,306
Well, it's stress, you know?

258
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:32,269
I'll make an appointment
with Doctor Berman for tomorrow.

259
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:33,687
For early tomorrow.

260
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:35,272
We'll all go.

261
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,316
Yeah. You remember Dagmar?

262
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:43,612
- Okay. Do you think that's a good idea?
- I do. I think we should do it.

263
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,489
Yeah.

264
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,576
- That's a good idea, I was gonna go...
- Let's go to bed.

265
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,619
...shopping for wheelchairs, anyway.

266
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:53,122
- So, goodnight.
- Night.

267
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,291
I'll see you tomorrow.

268
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:45,964
Oh, my God.

269
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:09,445
Natasha escaped from Moscow,

270
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,532
where she was forced to strip
for the Russian mob.

271
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:16,035
Now all she wants is
an all-American male to love.

272
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:21,998
Midori left a high-paying job in Tokyo
because she was unsatisfied as a woman.

273
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,461
Tammy dropped out of high school
to join the rodeo.

274
00:25:26,587 --> 00:25:30,423
Are you the right cowboy
to tame this wild filly?

275
00:25:45,063 --> 00:25:47,356
The doctor will tell us what to do.

276
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:51,110
But she's family practice.
We need a shrink.

277
00:25:51,194 --> 00:25:53,737
No, she's a psychologist, too.

278
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,035
She says you have to be,
this far north.

279
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:07,042
What'll people think?

280
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:11,838
We can't worry about that.

281
00:26:15,593 --> 00:26:16,843
Right.

282
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:37,237
Right there
is where my dad used to work.

283
00:26:38,573 --> 00:26:39,740
Our dad.

284
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:45,412
That's the library. I have a card,
you can borrow it if you want to.

285
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:49,875
Actually, I'll have to take them out
for you, but you just tell me.

286
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:54,254
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know, actually. Gus?

287
00:26:55,172 --> 00:26:56,923
What was it that dad did?

288
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:00,092
Water and Power.

289
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,188
My job's at the School Department.

290
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,611
I miss everybody, but there's
so much to do in the house.

291
00:27:19,112 --> 00:27:22,198
I'll go back
as soon as the baby's old enough and...

292
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:41,967
Yeah. Sure.

293
00:27:42,885 --> 00:27:44,469
"Reader's Digest",

294
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:48,973
"Midwest Living" or "Country Home"?

295
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:52,059
That's what I would say.

296
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:09,618
Well, her blood pressure's low.

297
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:18,168
- Is that serious? - Could be.
We'll have to wait and see.

298
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,132
It's fine.

299
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:27,468
Mine's probably low, too.

300
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:34,893
I...

301
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:39,605
I want you to bring her in
every week for a special treatment.

302
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:42,107
Can you do that?

303
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:49,698
Are you sure that's necessary?

304
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:54,953
- Yes.
- Okay. Okay.

305
00:28:56,498 --> 00:28:57,873
What do you think?

306
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:01,627
If that's what she says,
then we should.

307
00:29:02,878 --> 00:29:04,128
Okay.

308
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,757
You can set that up with Joanna,
at the desk.

309
00:29:09,802 --> 00:29:12,512
I look forward
to getting to know you, Bianca.

310
00:29:16,683 --> 00:29:20,436
- Karin, I'm telling you,
he belongs in a hospital! - No!

311
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:24,023
My Uncle Garth went to one
of those places and never came back.

312
00:29:24,106 --> 00:29:26,358
But he needs more help
than we are able to give.

313
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:29,778
- I told you something was wrong
and you wouldn't listen! - If I may.

314
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:33,615
Has Lars been functional?

315
00:29:33,783 --> 00:29:36,326
Does he go to work,
wash, dress himself?

316
00:29:36,494 --> 00:29:37,953
So far.

317
00:29:39,664 --> 00:29:42,040
Has he had any violent episodes?

318
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:46,419
No! No, never. He's a sweetheart,
he never even raises his voice.

319
00:29:46,546 --> 00:29:47,629
Okay.

320
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,923
We gotta fix him.
Can you fix him?

321
00:29:50,173 --> 00:29:51,882
I don't know, Gus.

322
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:56,762
I don't believe he's psychotic
or schizophrenic.

323
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,350
I don't think this is caused by genes
or faulty wiring in the brain.

324
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,769
So, what the hell is going on then?

325
00:30:03,854 --> 00:30:05,688
He appears to have a delusion.

326
00:30:05,772 --> 00:30:07,022
A delusion?

327
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:10,526
What the hell is he doing
with a delusion, for Christ's sake?

328
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,695
That's what we have to find out.

329
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:16,115
Chances are he's been
decompensating for some time.

330
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,368
I guess we didn't realize.

331
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:27,876
Have there been any changes
in the family in the last year or so?

332
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,461
No, everything is
pretty much exactly the same,

333
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:34,132
except that Karin is pregnant
and Lars is nuts.

334
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:37,510
You know, this isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

335
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:42,098
What we call mental illness
isn't always just an illness.

336
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:46,685
It can be a communication,
a way to work something out.

337
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,979
Fantastic.
When will it be over?

338
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:51,023
When he doesn't need it anymore.

339
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,861
How can we help?

340
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,576
- Go along with it.
- Oh, no. No, that's...

341
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:08,207
Oh, my! No, no, no.
I mean, pretend that she's real?

342
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:10,583
I can't.
I'm just not gonna do it.

343
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:13,211
- She is real.
- Well... - I mean,

344
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:15,338
she's right out there.

345
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:16,964
Right. I get that.

346
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,926
But I'm not gonna do it.

347
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,553
You won't be able
to change his mind anyway.

348
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:24,514
Bianca's in town for a reason.

349
00:31:24,598 --> 00:31:27,225
- Right, but...
- It's not really a choice.

350
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:34,856
Okay. Okay. Alright.
Then we'll do it. Whatever it takes.

351
00:31:34,982 --> 00:31:37,984
Oh, yeah.
And everyone's gonna laugh at him.

352
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,861
And you.

353
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,084
She loves kids.

354
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:04,385
- More coffee, Lars?
- Yes, please.

355
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:07,429
You see the funny face?

356
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:11,517
Does Bianca want some?

357
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:14,854
Yeah.

358
00:32:16,189 --> 00:32:18,232
- There you go.
- Thank you, Karin.

359
00:32:18,816 --> 00:32:20,483
Gus? No? Okay.

360
00:32:21,861 --> 00:32:23,111
Sure.

361
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:31,161
Are you not gonna
go to work today, Gus?

362
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:35,957
- I don't feel good.
- Oh, no.

363
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:41,921
Bianca could help you.
She has nurse's training.

364
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:46,384
No, she doesn't. She doesn't
have nurse's training, Lars,

365
00:32:46,468 --> 00:32:48,343
because she's not a person.

366
00:32:48,595 --> 00:32:50,345
She's a big plastic thing.

367
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:54,099
That's amazing.

368
00:32:56,144 --> 00:32:57,478
Did you hear that?

369
00:32:58,938 --> 00:33:01,940
Bianca just said that's why
God made her, to help people.

370
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,658
Are you gonna be late?

371
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:14,619
For work?

372
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:21,000
I am gonna be late.

373
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,294
I have to go.

374
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:24,670
Okay.

375
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,632
But I'm going to check in.

376
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,175
Okey-doke.

377
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:32,136
- You have my number at work,
right, Karin? - Yeah.

378
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,479
I wanted to tell you
you look really pretty today.

379
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:49,110
I hope you feel better, Gus.

380
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,321
Me, too.

381
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:54,074
- And thanks so much for breakfast.
- No.

382
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,410
- Okay, gotta go. Bye!
- See you!

383
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,416
Well, I had to try. You know...

384
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:12,007
- What? What? What?
- It's just... I don't know.

385
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:17,721
It's true. We've been all wrapped up
in ourselves. We have, Gus!

386
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:21,225
This is not my fault, though.
It's not my fault.

387
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,526
Come on, Bianca.
Let's make a couple of calls.

388
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:50,169
Good morning, Cindy.
You look pretty today.

389
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:52,129
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Sunshine...

390
00:34:54,632 --> 00:35:00,596
It's way in advance, but you know
how excited I get about these things.

391
00:35:07,145 --> 00:35:11,398
- Where are they? I know you took them.
- Did not. - You did, too. As revenge.

392
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:14,026
- For what?
- The fake rat I put in your drawer.

393
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:15,109
Oh, that.

394
00:35:15,194 --> 00:35:17,945
Lars, I'm missing 3
of my action figures.

395
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:21,449
It's your turn to get coffee.

396
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,995
Listen up, Margo. Those action figures
are extremely important to me.

397
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,455
They're worth a lot of money.

398
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:29,999
If I don't see every damn one
back on my desk soon,

399
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:33,377
you can tell your teddy bear
to watch his back.

400
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:47,098
I'll return them.
One at a time.

401
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:56,066
- Are you going to Cindy's party?
- Oh, no.

402
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,822
I was hoping you would.
I really wish you would.

403
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:05,783
Well, maybe.

404
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:07,993
That'd be great!

405
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,081
Do you think
I could bring my girlfriend?

406
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,417
Yeah!

407
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:18,212
Yeah. I mean,
I'm totally bringing somebody.

408
00:36:26,263 --> 00:36:27,346
Wow.

409
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:29,305
I didn't know there were sex dolls!

410
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,516
Love dolls.
That's what they call them.

411
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:34,519
I saw a special on cable.

412
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:37,230
So you're serious?
Bianca really has a...

413
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:42,861
She's really
just one of the girls then.

414
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:45,947
I'm sorry.

415
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:48,741
Que un hombre se compro
una muneca que se infla...

416
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:50,577
Le salen las tetas asi,
el tipo se la come...

417
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:52,995
Sale volando.

418
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:56,206
No way!

419
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:00,169
Does she have a sister?

420
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,381
I wish I had a woman
that couldn't talk.

421
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:10,429
It's not that funny.
It's not that funny.

422
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:13,974
We don't want anything to do with her.
She's a golden calf.

423
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:16,268
We all know what happened with that.

424
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:18,978
He's not worshipping her.
They're just dating?

425
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,355
These young people have no willpower!

426
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,524
He's sick, alright? He's sick.

427
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:29,280
We were just hoping, if we came to you,
you could help pave the way a little.

428
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:32,200
If you could just try to understand...

429
00:37:32,326 --> 00:37:34,577
- He is a nice man.
- We can try.

430
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:37,580
- I don't know why we're here.
- Oh, for Heaven's sake!

431
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,207
What's the big deal?

432
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:44,337
Sally, your cousin
puts dresses on his cats.

433
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:49,466
Hazel, your nephew
gave all his money to a UFO club.

434
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,636
Arnie, everybody knows
your first wife was a klepto.

435
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,597
- She wasn't! - Why is she buried
in a pair of my earrings?

436
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:58,058
That's enough.

437
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:00,435
These things happen.

438
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,730
Lars is a good boy.

439
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:09,276
You can depend on me.

440
00:38:10,237 --> 00:38:11,695
Thanks, Mrs. Gruner.

441
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:16,367
Well, he's not bringing her to church,
is he, Reverend Bock?

442
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,456
Well...
The question is, as always,

443
00:38:25,377 --> 00:38:27,002
what would Jesus do?

444
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:39,681
#Oh, Holy, Holy,
merciful and mighty. #

445
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:48,857
#God in three Persons.
Blessed Trinity. #

446
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:56,448
I would like to take the opportunity

447
00:38:56,573 --> 00:39:00,159
to welcome all of our new visitors
to our church today.

448
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:05,747
Bianca, it's good to see you.
Lars, God bless. God bless.

449
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:09,710
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

450
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,796
- Watch yourself.
- Easy, easy.

451
00:39:16,718 --> 00:39:18,510
These are for you, Bianca.

452
00:39:20,013 --> 00:39:21,013
Thank you.

453
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:23,222
Bianca, this is my friend,
Mrs. Gruner.

454
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:26,434
She has a darling figure.

455
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,276
Those are nice. They're not real,
so they'll last forever. Isn't that neat?

456
00:39:37,446 --> 00:39:38,738
Hello.

457
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:43,326
Get back here!

458
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:19,360
There we go.
Watch your head on the way in.

459
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,696
Watch, watch!
There we go.

460
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:29,453
Are you comfortable?
I'll get the chair.

461
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:32,790
Can you put her seatbelt on?

462
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:35,709
Bianca, Gus is gonna
put on your seatbelt.

463
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:40,338
- And put that on her legs.
She gets cold. Thank you. - Yeah.

464
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:54,686
Thanks, Gus.

465
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:59,065
Where are you guys going?

466
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:03,944
Just one second.

467
00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:08,824
She doesn't know. It's a secret.
But I can tell you.

468
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:12,870
She's asking questions all the time
and wants to know all about me,

469
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:14,663
so I thought I'd take her

470
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:17,708
to the lake, where we used to play.

471
00:41:18,835 --> 00:41:21,253
- Yeah.
- Do you remember that? - Yeah.

472
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:24,256
That sounds nice.

473
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:27,925
Yeah. I gotta go.

474
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:30,636
I'm coming
Why are you yelling?

475
00:41:53,993 --> 00:41:57,120
Gus and his friends
used to come up here all the time.

476
00:41:57,371 --> 00:41:59,664
In the summer they'd go fishing.

477
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:02,751
In the winter they'd play hockey.

478
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,675
Watch your head.

479
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,470
Here we go.

480
00:42:15,347 --> 00:42:16,680
That's okay.

481
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:22,436
This was our tree-house.
The rope's here.

482
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:25,022
And the ladder.

483
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:47,127
#L is for the way you look at me, #

484
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:54,968
#O is for the only one I see, #

485
00:42:55,177 --> 00:43:02,892
#V is very, very extraordinary, #

486
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:11,985
#E is even more
than anyone that you adore. #

487
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:20,451
#And love
is all that I can give to you, #

488
00:43:20,618 --> 00:43:28,083
#Love
is more than just a game for two. #

489
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:33,380
#Two in love can make it... #

490
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:38,176
You should watch me
chop wood, too.

491
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,012
I'm really good at it.

492
00:43:51,815 --> 00:43:53,065
I'm sorry.

493
00:43:54,108 --> 00:43:57,152
I couldn't wait.
I wanted to see how she was doing.

494
00:43:57,236 --> 00:44:01,573
After the treatment, she has to rest.
It doesn't work without the resting.

495
00:44:04,744 --> 00:44:07,788
Keep me company?
Lars?

496
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:09,831
Keep me company.

497
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:23,302
Do you know how many sessions
she's gonna have to have?

498
00:44:25,722 --> 00:44:29,391
No. I don't, it's a tricky illness.

499
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:36,649
But, what I could use
is a more complete history on her.

500
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:39,902
- Parents...
- They died when she was a baby.

501
00:44:41,154 --> 00:44:44,073
- That's not fair.
- Yeah, but...

502
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,492
She doesn't feel sorry
for herself or anything.

503
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:51,121
She just wants to be normal,
have everyone treat her normal.

504
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:59,337
- That's nice. I admire that.
- Me too. Is that your husband?

505
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:04,008
- Yes. He died.
- Oh, no.

506
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,262
I'm sorry.

507
00:45:09,347 --> 00:45:11,140
- Do you have kids?
- No.

508
00:45:16,479 --> 00:45:18,272
You must get really lonely.

509
00:45:18,523 --> 00:45:21,567
Sometimes I get so lonely,
I forget what day it is and

510
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:23,152
how to spell my name.

511
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:30,784
How about you?

512
00:45:34,413 --> 00:45:35,580
You're funny.

513
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:40,626
So what's the difference between
a delusion and a hallucination?

514
00:45:41,211 --> 00:45:44,964
It's false perception
versus false belief.

515
00:45:45,048 --> 00:45:48,217
- So when Moose thinks
the FBI's after him... - The DEA.

516
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:51,637
- INS.
- IRS. ATF. AAA.

517
00:45:51,764 --> 00:45:53,347
That would be a delusion.

518
00:45:53,432 --> 00:45:55,725
Hey, dude,
they are after us.

519
00:46:02,648 --> 00:46:04,316
My dad told me that

520
00:46:07,028 --> 00:46:10,363
wood warms you three times:

521
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:14,993
First when you chop down a tree,
then when you chop it up...

522
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:37,139
- What are we doing? Why are we
doing this for him? - Come on.

523
00:46:39,184 --> 00:46:40,768
It's funny.

524
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,270
Is it?

525
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:47,566
I don't know.

526
00:46:47,775 --> 00:46:49,317
Maybe not.

527
00:46:55,282 --> 00:46:56,825
So tell me about Karin.

528
00:46:59,036 --> 00:47:01,955
- I don't know her very well.
- She's wonderful!

529
00:47:02,873 --> 00:47:06,209
Gus and I are both very lucky
with women. She's wonderful.

530
00:47:09,004 --> 00:47:10,797
But she...

531
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:17,928
We don't have to talk.
Let's find you something to read.

532
00:47:18,221 --> 00:47:22,558
- No, it's just... Between us?
- Of course.

533
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,522
I'm worried about her.

534
00:47:29,774 --> 00:47:31,900
I think she has a little problem.

535
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:36,071
- Maybe you shouldn't tell me.
- No, it's okay. It's just...

536
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,243
And I think it's
'cause she's insecure, but

537
00:47:42,744 --> 00:47:45,329
she's just always
trying to hug everybody.

538
00:47:45,622 --> 00:47:50,042
You know, some people don't like that!
Some people don't like to be hugged.

539
00:47:50,127 --> 00:47:54,338
But she doesn't realize that.
She takes it personally, and thinks...

540
00:47:54,882 --> 00:47:56,883
You know?
It hurts her feelings.

541
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:02,805
I don't know what to do about that.

542
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,433
Do you?

543
00:48:06,768 --> 00:48:11,146
But it's such a comfort sometimes,
to have somebody's arms around you.

544
00:48:11,272 --> 00:48:12,522
Don't you think?

545
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:16,693
- No.
- Come on, it feels good.

546
00:48:18,154 --> 00:48:20,197
It does not feel good.
It hurts.

547
00:48:24,285 --> 00:48:27,037
Like a cut or a bruise?

548
00:48:27,162 --> 00:48:31,749
Like a burn. Like when you go outside
and your feet freeze

549
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:35,002
and then you come back in
and they thaw out. It's like that.

550
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:38,631
It's almost exactly like that.

551
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,008
Same with everybody?

552
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:46,347
Well, not really with Bianca.

553
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,227
But everyone else.

554
00:48:51,852 --> 00:48:54,104
So, you don't let people touch you.

555
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,232
Lars, isn't that hard
to get away with?

556
00:48:58,776 --> 00:49:02,529
Not really here,
'cause I have all these layers.

557
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,616
- And that helps.
- Look...

558
00:49:07,701 --> 00:49:09,244
We can't change Karin.

559
00:49:10,788 --> 00:49:13,998
But I can help you.

560
00:49:22,257 --> 00:49:23,715
That's fine.

561
00:49:28,972 --> 00:49:30,222
Pain?

562
00:49:30,348 --> 00:49:32,099
Yeah, but I can take it.

563
00:49:42,317 --> 00:49:43,568
Are you okay?

564
00:49:47,406 --> 00:49:51,284
- Well, that's enough for today.
- Yeah. Thanks.

565
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,624
What?

566
00:49:59,126 --> 00:50:00,710
Yeah, I'm okay.

567
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:16,892
Well, it's scientifically proven
that everyone's favorite word

568
00:50:17,018 --> 00:50:18,894
is their own name, so

569
00:50:19,604 --> 00:50:20,937
if you just

570
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:23,982
say their names a lot, you're okay.

571
00:50:25,985 --> 00:50:28,361
You can see
it's gonna make them happy.

572
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:31,615
Okay.

573
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,216
Yeah.

574
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:52,051
Okay...

575
00:51:02,394 --> 00:51:04,437
Mr. Sunshine!

576
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:08,942
And this must be Bianca. Welcome!
Welcome. Come on in!

577
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:20,120
I have my boots on,
but I brought my shoes.

578
00:51:20,204 --> 00:51:22,831
Don't worry about it. Baxter?
Baxter, baby.

579
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:25,582
Lars, this is my husband.

580
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,045
Hi, Lars.

581
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:33,757
Bianca...

582
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,552
How are you?

583
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,473
Is that for me, Bianca?
Thank you!

584
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:47,396
Can Baxter get you two
something to drink from the kitchen?

585
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,865
Lars?

586
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,786
I'll have a beer.

587
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,123
And for Bianca?

588
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,585
She doesn't drink.

589
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:14,463
She doesn't like it when I drink either,
but I'm just gonna have one.

590
00:52:17,842 --> 00:52:19,843
I can help you with your coats.

591
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:25,015
Hi. This is Margo.
And this is Bianca.

592
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:28,435
Hi. Hi, Bianca.

593
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,193
I'm glad you sent around that memo.
I would have freaked.

594
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:38,652
It's so bizarre.

595
00:52:39,404 --> 00:52:42,323
- It's a disorder.
- What a weirdo.

596
00:52:43,575 --> 00:52:44,742
Lars?

597
00:52:45,452 --> 00:52:49,205
Look at him. He's in love
with that slutty hunk of silicone.

598
00:52:49,623 --> 00:52:52,875
- Her name's Bianca.
- Does he have sex with her?

599
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:54,919
Babe, that's what she's for.

600
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,965
- So, I hear you guys
are getting married! - Yes! - No!

601
00:53:01,884 --> 00:53:02,926
Tickle fight!

602
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,271
I would kill to have hair like hers.

603
00:53:15,356 --> 00:53:19,234
Oh, I'd cut it to here,
long in front, short in back.

604
00:53:19,985 --> 00:53:23,405
Lars would never let her cut it.
Guys and long hair...

605
00:53:25,907 --> 00:53:27,282
I don't care.

606
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:31,370
However she likes it,
that's how I like it.

607
00:53:32,497 --> 00:53:34,081
That's my kind of guy.

608
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:37,292
I need wine.

609
00:53:39,796 --> 00:53:40,963
I'll get it.

610
00:53:42,632 --> 00:53:45,968
- Anyone else?
- Oh, no. - No, thanks.

611
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:05,319
Dude...

612
00:54:06,905 --> 00:54:09,824
Hey, Lars.
Bianca? Total babe.

613
00:54:11,577 --> 00:54:15,955
- Thanks. - The best thing is,
she doesn't know how hot she is.

614
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:18,582
That's what you want in a woman.
They stay with you,

615
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:21,126
'cause they don't know
they could get somebody better.

616
00:54:21,252 --> 00:54:22,878
You know what I'm saying?

617
00:54:24,005 --> 00:54:26,381
Is she flexible?

618
00:54:40,062 --> 00:54:41,187
Yes.

619
00:56:01,098 --> 00:56:02,557
Did you have fun?

620
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:14,152
Yeah.

621
00:56:18,031 --> 00:56:19,824
I'm just happy, that's all.

622
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:32,711
And so he solaced himself
with pacing up and down the meadow

623
00:56:32,795 --> 00:56:35,464
and writing and carving
on the bark of the trees

624
00:56:35,548 --> 00:56:38,175
and on the fine sand
a multitude of verses,

625
00:56:38,342 --> 00:56:42,637
all in harmony with his sadness.
In sum and praise of Dulcinea.

626
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:04,366
But what distressed him greatly

627
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:07,244
was not having another hermit there
to confess him.

628
00:57:35,188 --> 00:57:36,522
Pain?

629
00:57:37,399 --> 00:57:38,649
That's okay.

630
00:57:39,484 --> 00:57:41,443
That's okay.
I can take that.

631
00:57:44,531 --> 00:57:47,199
You must be excited
about a baby on the way.

632
00:57:50,995 --> 00:57:52,830
Don't you want to be an uncle?

633
00:57:56,876 --> 00:57:58,460
Yeah...

634
00:58:03,048 --> 00:58:06,092
- Do you ever wanna be a mom?
- I don't know.

635
00:58:16,437 --> 00:58:17,770
Yes.

636
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:24,777
But I'm not able
to have children of my own.

637
00:58:27,697 --> 00:58:29,906
Oh, that's too bad.

638
00:58:40,877 --> 00:58:42,836
Bianca's like that, actually.

639
00:58:49,634 --> 00:58:51,844
She can't have babies, either.

640
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:54,138
That's a shame.

641
00:58:55,891 --> 00:58:58,684
When she was a baby,
her mom died in the middle of things

642
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,811
when she was being born.

643
00:59:02,064 --> 00:59:03,522
Like yours.

644
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:07,401
You have a lot in common.

645
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:21,706
Lars, you know we've learned a lot
since then.

646
00:59:21,999 --> 00:59:25,668
- Things are better.
- But it could still happen, right?

647
00:59:25,753 --> 00:59:28,671
It's highly unlikely. It's

648
00:59:30,049 --> 00:59:32,425
rare.
- Yeah, but it still could.

649
00:59:37,056 --> 00:59:39,432
Lars, just take a breath.

650
00:59:45,814 --> 00:59:47,189
That's okay.

651
00:59:48,733 --> 00:59:49,983
I'm sorry.

652
00:59:51,486 --> 00:59:53,987
I'm sorry.
It's just so dangerous.

653
00:59:54,572 --> 00:59:57,324
- I don't like to think about it.
- Lars, sit down.

654
00:59:57,409 --> 00:59:59,034
Put your head between your knees.

655
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,745
Put your head between your knees.
Sit down.

656
01:00:03,747 --> 01:00:06,874
Just put your head
between your knees. Bend over.

657
01:00:07,334 --> 01:00:09,210
Okay. Okay.

658
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,421
Okay.

659
01:00:13,215 --> 01:00:16,843
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Take a breath.

660
01:00:27,729 --> 01:00:31,398
We should get cell phones.

661
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:35,652
Then we can call each other
whenever we want.

662
01:00:47,373 --> 01:00:51,710
How about afternoons,
Mondays and Wednesdays,

663
01:00:51,794 --> 01:00:53,754
and then maybe all day Saturday?

664
01:01:01,678 --> 01:01:03,637
Yeah? You sure?

665
01:01:03,805 --> 01:01:06,599
Okay!
Bianca, is that okay with you?

666
01:01:07,934 --> 01:01:11,896
Bianca wants to volunteer
at the hospital on Thursday afternoons.

667
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:14,815
You do?

668
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:17,943
What about your blood pressure?

669
01:01:18,694 --> 01:01:22,864
Just think of all the bald children.
Wouldn't they love her?

670
01:01:23,616 --> 01:01:25,158
That's true.

671
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:28,661
A little bit of layering here
and some texture right there.

672
01:01:28,746 --> 01:01:31,414
And I don't know
what you guys think, but...

673
01:01:33,918 --> 01:01:37,045
- Bangs?
- I like that. - That's pretty.

674
01:01:38,506 --> 01:01:41,633
Are you sure?
Because it's not growing back, right?

675
01:01:45,303 --> 01:01:48,722
"What's That Sound?"
By Veronica Charles.

676
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,601
- I hear the telephone.
- Ring! Ring!

677
01:02:28,387 --> 01:02:30,888
- Hey.
- Hey.

678
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,814
He's not gonna get any better, is he?

679
01:02:44,152 --> 01:02:46,361
No, probably not.

680
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:50,866
He's gonna love that thing

681
01:02:52,827 --> 01:02:56,913
his whole life,
and it's all my fault.

682
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:01,834
No, it's not.

683
01:03:03,003 --> 01:03:04,545
I don't know.

684
01:03:05,922 --> 01:03:11,552
I mean, I left home
as fast as I could. You know?

685
01:03:13,972 --> 01:03:16,057
I never thought about him.

686
01:03:16,475 --> 01:03:20,519
Then the two of us
move back here all fat and happy,

687
01:03:20,853 --> 01:03:24,522
and he moves into the goddamn garage
like the family dog.

688
01:03:25,983 --> 01:03:28,902
And I let him.

689
01:03:32,448 --> 01:03:35,575
No wonder he goes
and orders a fiance in a box.

690
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:40,580
Come here.

691
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:06,271
There was this pair of... Benji?

692
01:04:06,398 --> 01:04:09,108
- Oh, Basenjis?
- Basenjis!

693
01:04:09,526 --> 01:04:11,735
Yes, there were these two Basenjis.

694
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:14,737
They don't bark at all.

695
01:04:40,722 --> 01:04:41,972
Hello!

696
01:04:50,314 --> 01:04:51,481
Bianca!

697
01:04:52,024 --> 01:04:53,692
We're upstairs!

698
01:04:59,615 --> 01:05:00,866
What's going on?

699
01:05:01,033 --> 01:05:04,243
It's the hospital volunteer banquet
at the VFW.

700
01:05:04,453 --> 01:05:07,872
- Doesn't she look beautiful?
- She does. She looks beautiful!

701
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:12,209
Because...

702
01:05:14,421 --> 01:05:16,589
We were supposed to play Scrabble.

703
01:05:17,549 --> 01:05:18,799
Are you sure?

704
01:05:19,259 --> 01:05:20,259
Yeah.

705
01:05:20,343 --> 01:05:22,970
Her schedule's on the refrigerator.
Did you check?

706
01:05:24,347 --> 01:05:27,058
No, I didn't. I forgot.

707
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:34,272
Could I have a moment
alone with her, please?

708
01:05:38,986 --> 01:05:40,236
Thank you.

709
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:42,614
Thank you.

710
01:05:48,996 --> 01:05:50,330
You're my girlfriend!

711
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:54,917
I shouldn't have to check a schedule
to see when you make a plan!

712
01:05:55,877 --> 01:05:57,878
You have 10 people
around you all the time!

713
01:05:57,962 --> 01:06:00,297
You can't ask one of them
to call me and let me know?

714
01:06:00,382 --> 01:06:04,259
- They never fight. - At work I get
excited about playing Scrabble...

715
01:06:04,344 --> 01:06:06,011
I don't like his tone.

716
01:06:12,227 --> 01:06:13,727
Now, you listen to me.

717
01:06:13,812 --> 01:06:15,979
Bianca has a life of her own.

718
01:06:16,063 --> 01:06:18,773
No self-respecting woman
is gonna be at your beck and call!

719
01:06:18,857 --> 01:06:20,483
The sooner you learn that, the better.

720
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:23,194
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah, you're away
at yourjob all day.

721
01:06:23,278 --> 01:06:27,240
What's she supposed to do? Wait for you?
Would you do that for her?

722
01:06:27,324 --> 01:06:29,075
Would she even ask you to?

723
01:06:29,702 --> 01:06:33,913
She's out in the community doing
things for others less fortunate.

724
01:06:33,997 --> 01:06:36,791
- You should be proud of her.
- What about me?

725
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:40,795
Big baby.
He's just like my husband!

726
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:43,505
She'll be home at 11.

727
01:07:01,149 --> 01:07:04,776
She's my girlfriend and I shouldn't
have to check a schedule to see her!

728
01:07:09,114 --> 01:07:10,364
Are you okay?

729
01:07:12,576 --> 01:07:15,077
How would she feel if I just left her?

730
01:07:16,204 --> 01:07:21,959
- What if I abandoned her? - She didn't
abandon you. She'll be back.

731
01:07:23,628 --> 01:07:25,421
How do I know that?

732
01:07:27,716 --> 01:07:30,301
People do whatever they want.

733
01:07:31,802 --> 01:07:36,181
- They don't care.
- No, we all care. Lars, we do care.

734
01:07:38,476 --> 01:07:39,601
No, you don't.

735
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:45,565
That is...
That is just not true! God!

736
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:49,277
Every person in this town

737
01:07:49,487 --> 01:07:52,781
bends over backwards
to make Bianca feel at home.

738
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:56,451
Why do you think
she has so many places to go

739
01:07:56,659 --> 01:07:58,160
and so much to do?

740
01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:03,165
- I don't know.
- Because of you!

741
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:07,169
Because all these people love you!

742
01:08:07,879 --> 01:08:11,006
We push her wheelchair,
we drive her to work,

743
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:15,803
we drive her home,
we wash her, we dress her,

744
01:08:16,554 --> 01:08:20,391
we get her up,
we put her to bed, we carry her!

745
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:25,645
And she is not petite, Lars!
Bianca is a big, big girl!

746
01:08:27,106 --> 01:08:31,567
None of this is easy for any of us,
but we do it!

747
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:36,364
God, we do it for you!

748
01:08:39,326 --> 01:08:43,287
So don't you dare tell me
how we don't care!

749
01:08:57,885 --> 01:09:01,555
I think it's the person's job
who's upset, to say they're upset,

750
01:09:01,639 --> 01:09:03,265
because they cannot, you know...

751
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:05,058
- Hey!
- Oh, hey.

752
01:09:05,393 --> 01:09:07,561
- Hey!
- How was the game?

753
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,690
The cheese inspectors
beat the crap out of us.

754
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:16,861
Is everything all right?
I usually put Bianca to bed.

755
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:18,154
I know.

756
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,324
Okay, tell him.

757
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,119
We wanted
to talk to you about that.

758
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,543
You don't have to do that anymore.
I'm gonna do that.

759
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:35,087
Are you sure?
Because I don't mind.

760
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,588
I thought that you...

761
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:38,548
Sorry.

762
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:44,179
- It's just been one of those days.
- It's... It's fine.

763
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,140
It's up to you.

764
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:52,771
- I'll leave you guys.
- Hey, Gus?

765
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,149
- What's that?
- Thank you, though.

766
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,986
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, you did.

767
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:04,114
Okay.

768
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:09,870
I'm tired.

769
01:10:17,295 --> 01:10:20,005
- Did I miss something?
- We had a big fight!

770
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,590
- Really?
- Yes!

771
01:10:32,518 --> 01:10:36,020
Are those hand knit mittens?

772
01:10:36,605 --> 01:10:38,564
I think it's kind of cold out.

773
01:10:43,946 --> 01:10:46,989
- Lars, have you met Erik?
- Not officially.

774
01:10:47,658 --> 01:10:49,367
You're famous around here.

775
01:10:51,452 --> 01:10:52,619
I know.

776
01:10:53,454 --> 01:10:55,080
Hell of a grip too, pal.

777
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:58,333
Yeah.

778
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:27,820
Yes?

779
01:11:40,833 --> 01:11:45,336
- My office.
- I think I'm gonna stay.

780
01:11:46,714 --> 01:11:48,840
She's feeling pretty lousy today.

781
01:11:51,177 --> 01:11:52,761
We'll both stay.

782
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,147
I asked her to marry me last week.

783
01:12:09,235 --> 01:12:10,944
Congratulations!

784
01:12:12,822 --> 01:12:14,365
When's the happy day?

785
01:12:15,116 --> 01:12:16,575
She said no.

786
01:12:20,538 --> 01:12:22,623
I know. I couldn't believe it.

787
01:12:25,543 --> 01:12:27,044
Yeah.

788
01:12:34,301 --> 01:12:38,346
Stop it! You have no right
to talk to me like that!

789
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:39,722
No, you don't!

790
01:12:39,807 --> 01:12:42,058
You don't.
I don't talk to you like that!

791
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:58,824
Have you stopped yelling?

792
01:13:38,905 --> 01:13:40,781
I was talking to Bianca

793
01:13:40,866 --> 01:13:44,744
and she was saying that, in her culture,
they have these rites of passages

794
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:47,370
and rituals and ceremonies...

795
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,457
Just all kinds of things
that when you do them,

796
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:52,542
or when you're done,
if you live through them,

797
01:13:52,626 --> 01:13:54,377
they'll let you know
you're an adult.

798
01:13:55,838 --> 01:13:57,505
Doesn't that sound great?

799
01:13:58,424 --> 01:13:59,799
It does.

800
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,970
- How did you know?
- How did I know what?

801
01:14:04,388 --> 01:14:05,847
That you were a man.

802
01:14:08,558 --> 01:14:10,351
I couldn't tell you.

803
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,605
Was it...

804
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:16,732
Was it sex?

805
01:14:25,116 --> 01:14:26,867
Yeah, you know...

806
01:14:26,993 --> 01:14:28,786
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of...

807
01:14:28,912 --> 01:14:33,874
No. Well, it's kind of sex,
but it's not, you know?

808
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:36,250
I don't know.
I don't know.

809
01:14:36,585 --> 01:14:38,753
It's a good question.

810
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:41,297
Yeah, but I have to know.

811
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:44,300
Hold that thought.

812
01:14:56,313 --> 01:14:59,107
- You should ask Dagmar.
- I did ask Dagmar.

813
01:14:59,273 --> 01:15:00,982
She said I should ask you.

814
01:15:04,278 --> 01:15:08,156
- I can only give you my opinion.
- That's all I want.

815
01:15:08,241 --> 01:15:10,534
It's not like
you're all one thing or the other.

816
01:15:10,618 --> 01:15:12,202
There's still a kid inside.

817
01:15:12,286 --> 01:15:15,122
But you grow up
when you decide to do right.

818
01:15:15,206 --> 01:15:18,166
Not what's right for you;
what's right for everybody.

819
01:15:18,251 --> 01:15:20,335
Even when it hurts.

820
01:15:22,212 --> 01:15:23,879
Okay. Like, what?

821
01:15:27,217 --> 01:15:28,300
Like...

822
01:15:29,553 --> 01:15:35,141
Like you don't jerk people around,
and you don't cheat on your woman,

823
01:15:35,225 --> 01:15:38,769
and you take care of your family.
You admit when you're wrong.

824
01:15:38,937 --> 01:15:40,688
You try to, anyways.

825
01:15:42,482 --> 01:15:44,483
That's all I can think of.

826
01:15:45,068 --> 01:15:47,653
It sounds like it's easy and,
for some reason, it's not.

827
01:15:47,737 --> 01:15:51,156
- I know, because nothing's easy.
- It's like the old man.

828
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,450
He didn't have
to take care of 2 kids alone.

829
01:15:53,534 --> 01:15:56,745
He could have given us to an orphanage.
People do that.

830
01:15:56,829 --> 01:16:00,498
But he loved us and tried to do right,
even though he didn't know how

831
01:16:00,666 --> 01:16:03,043
and even though
he had a broken heart.

832
01:16:13,553 --> 01:16:15,721
I shouldn't have left you
alone with him.

833
01:16:15,972 --> 01:16:19,433
He was too sad.
It scared me and I just...

834
01:16:20,769 --> 01:16:22,144
I just ran.

835
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:27,274
That was selfish

836
01:16:29,569 --> 01:16:31,028
and I'm sorry.

837
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:37,617
That's okay.

838
01:16:41,789 --> 01:16:42,830
Okay.

839
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,754
You've crossed the line!

840
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:54,258
- You kept swiping my action figures.
- I hide them! I don't hang them!

841
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:57,178
Whatever, you're too old
for that thing, anyway. Okay?

842
01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:01,182
- Take off the noose.
- No. - Take it off!

843
01:17:01,641 --> 01:17:05,185
Face it, Margo! The bear is dead.
Okay? Burn on you!

844
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:13,985
I warned her.

845
01:17:32,587 --> 01:17:34,463
It's not just the bear.

846
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:37,508
I broke up with Erik.

847
01:17:45,517 --> 01:17:47,059
I'm sorry to hear that.

848
01:17:49,104 --> 01:17:51,522
Yeah, I didn't even
have a good reason.

849
01:17:52,106 --> 01:17:54,315
He just wasn't very interesting.

850
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:06,828
Then why was he your boyfriend?

851
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:12,334
I get lonely.

852
01:18:15,378 --> 01:18:17,338
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

853
01:18:35,815 --> 01:18:37,191
Thank you.

854
01:18:38,151 --> 01:18:39,276
Sure.

855
01:18:42,696 --> 01:18:45,156
Hey, what are you doing
on Friday night?

856
01:18:48,577 --> 01:18:53,998
I have a School Board meeting.
Bianca got elected, so...

857
01:18:55,793 --> 01:18:58,378
- That's great!
- Yeah. - Yeah.

858
01:19:02,174 --> 01:19:03,299
Okay.

859
01:19:05,927 --> 01:19:07,094
Why?

860
01:19:08,221 --> 01:19:12,057
I was just thinking that maybe
we could all go out sometime.

861
01:19:15,019 --> 01:19:18,772
- Never mind.
- After I drop off Bianca, I'm free.

862
01:19:19,273 --> 01:19:21,483
But just me, so...

863
01:19:26,364 --> 01:19:28,073
That would be great, Lars!

864
01:19:29,741 --> 01:19:30,992
Thank you.

865
01:19:34,413 --> 01:19:35,579
Okay.

866
01:19:58,561 --> 01:19:59,811
Nice shot.

867
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:27,796
You're putting
too much spin on the ball.

868
01:20:28,006 --> 01:20:29,048
I know.

869
01:20:35,388 --> 01:20:38,474
Sorry, we're full up. Next week's
the Ladies League Tournament.

870
01:20:38,558 --> 01:20:41,185
- Nada? - Dude!
- Tell them lady go.

871
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,270
No way, Nelson,
they'll shred me.

872
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:46,064
Is that Lars?

873
01:20:48,484 --> 01:20:52,445
- Hey, buddy!
- We're full. - No problema!

874
01:20:57,201 --> 01:21:00,828
- I kicked your butt.
- No, no, I'll kick your butt!

875
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:07,168
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

876
01:22:25,243 --> 01:22:30,581
This was exactly what I needed.
Things look so much better!

877
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:34,418
Thanks for going bowling with me, Lars.

878
01:22:43,136 --> 01:22:44,470
I don't...

879
01:22:52,811 --> 01:22:59,817
I don't want to give you
the wrong idea about this.

880
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:07,867
It's just,
I never could cheat on Bianca, ever.

881
01:23:08,285 --> 01:23:10,495
Oh! No!

882
01:23:11,246 --> 01:23:14,957
Oh, my God,
I hope you didn't think that, Lars.

883
01:23:15,583 --> 01:23:17,084
I would never do that.

884
01:23:27,512 --> 01:23:29,179
I would never do that.

885
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:35,977
Oh, okay, good. Yeah.

886
01:23:36,187 --> 01:23:40,232
Because a man doesn't cheat
on his woman, and that's that.

887
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:43,818
Absolutely. And vice versa.

888
01:23:44,653 --> 01:23:48,406
Besides, I don't mean
to steal anybody's boyfriend.

889
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:51,492
One day,
I'll find a man of my own and

890
01:23:53,704 --> 01:23:55,121
we'll be happy, too.

891
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,751
That's the way it works, I guess.

892
01:24:19,145 --> 01:24:20,437
Thanks.

893
01:24:24,275 --> 01:24:25,734
Snow!

894
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:34,199
I was hoping that winter was over.

895
01:24:35,368 --> 01:24:39,371
No, it's a thaw.
Winter isn't over till Easter.

896
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:48,756
Thanks again.

897
01:24:50,216 --> 01:24:51,342
Hey.

898
01:25:18,409 --> 01:25:19,868
Goodnight, Lars.

899
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:42,057
I'm not sure how well
these treatments are working.

900
01:25:42,307 --> 01:25:43,599
No?

901
01:25:48,271 --> 01:25:49,730
What do you think?

902
01:25:51,733 --> 01:25:53,192
I don't know.

903
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,450
I'm sorry.

904
01:26:11,794 --> 01:26:14,504
I don't know.
It's hard, because

905
01:26:16,882 --> 01:26:19,634
I know that she loves me, but

906
01:26:19,802 --> 01:26:22,262
I ask her to marry me
and she says: "No".

907
01:26:25,349 --> 01:26:27,225
Or she says: "I don't know".

908
01:26:30,187 --> 01:26:32,063
Or she doesn't say anything.

909
01:26:37,485 --> 01:26:38,944
Nothing?

910
01:26:46,703 --> 01:26:53,500
When I was a child, I spoke
as a child. I understood as a child.

911
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:11,059
Hey...

912
01:27:57,562 --> 01:27:59,146
Wake up!

913
01:27:59,564 --> 01:28:00,940
Wake up!

914
01:28:04,945 --> 01:28:06,320
She won't wake up.

915
01:28:06,905 --> 01:28:11,242
- Bianca! I think she's unconscious!
- Are you sure? - Look at me. Bianca?

916
01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:14,160
Hey, hey, hey!

917
01:28:14,453 --> 01:28:16,871
- Bianca's unconscious!
- Can you hear me?

918
01:28:16,956 --> 01:28:18,123
Bianca!

919
01:28:21,168 --> 01:28:22,168
Wake up!

920
01:28:22,253 --> 01:28:25,547
Hey, she looks alright!
She looks alright!

921
01:28:25,715 --> 01:28:28,383
- Hey, hey!
- Call 911! - Okay.

922
01:28:32,179 --> 01:28:36,766
- 911? - I don't know! You always
expect me to know what to do!

923
01:28:46,568 --> 01:28:48,485
They're here.
Call Doctor Berman.

924
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:50,571
#... you look at me, #

925
01:28:50,655 --> 01:28:53,699
#O is for the only one I see, #

926
01:28:53,908 --> 01:28:57,244
#V is very, very extraordinary, #

927
01:28:57,454 --> 01:29:00,581
#E is even more than anyone... #

928
01:29:00,749 --> 01:29:02,875
I'm sorry,
you'll have to wait out here.

929
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:04,542
#... that you adore. #

930
01:29:05,544 --> 01:29:07,712
It's okay.
The doctor's on the way.

931
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:11,341
Hello? Hello?

932
01:29:11,508 --> 01:29:13,426
- Lars!
- Yeah.

933
01:29:24,605 --> 01:29:25,730
What?

934
01:29:29,108 --> 01:29:30,233
What?

935
01:29:31,402 --> 01:29:33,153
Bianca's very sick.

936
01:29:35,365 --> 01:29:38,408
No, she's not.
Come on, she's not sick.

937
01:29:38,826 --> 01:29:40,494
She's not! Lars?

938
01:29:43,665 --> 01:29:44,790
She's dying.

939
01:29:46,376 --> 01:29:47,834
- But...
- God!

940
01:29:48,586 --> 01:29:51,463
We're gonna keep her here
till she's stable, but

941
01:29:52,089 --> 01:29:54,382
she wants to go home
with Lars tonight.

942
01:29:54,883 --> 01:29:56,425
- Can I see her?
- Sure.

943
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,367
What?

944
01:30:43,054 --> 01:30:46,140
I'm sorry, but I just don't get it.

945
01:30:46,266 --> 01:30:50,227
What's this gonna do to him?
How could you let this happen?

946
01:30:50,437 --> 01:30:54,940
I'm not letting it happen, it's Lars.
It's always been Lars.

947
01:30:55,984 --> 01:31:00,195
He's making the decisions.
He's the one who found her unconscious;

948
01:31:00,405 --> 01:31:02,656
he's the one who said she's dying.

949
01:31:16,253 --> 01:31:17,920
Are you okay back there?

950
01:31:18,756 --> 01:31:21,466
They gave her something,
so she's asleep.

951
01:31:23,218 --> 01:31:24,927
Anything you want, Lars?

952
01:31:30,767 --> 01:31:33,435
We're gonna stay together
in the pink room tonight.

953
01:33:20,331 --> 01:33:24,917
Come down to the family room, Lars.
Let Bianca rest.

954
01:33:34,011 --> 01:33:36,304
We sent Gus and Karin to the movies.

955
01:33:37,472 --> 01:33:39,431
They didn't want to leave you.

956
01:33:45,521 --> 01:33:49,274
No, I'm glad...
I'm glad they left.

957
01:33:49,692 --> 01:33:53,362
I feel terrible that all this is
happening so close to the baby coming.

958
01:33:53,446 --> 01:33:56,823
That's how life is, Lars.
Everything at once.

959
01:33:57,241 --> 01:33:58,909
We brought casseroles.

960
01:34:00,702 --> 01:34:01,953
Thank you.

961
01:34:09,711 --> 01:34:12,588
Is there something
I should be doing right now?

962
01:34:12,798 --> 01:34:15,216
- No, dear.
- You eat.

963
01:34:16,969 --> 01:34:18,469
We came over to sit.

964
01:34:18,971 --> 01:34:21,514
That's what people do
when tragedy strikes.

965
01:34:21,682 --> 01:34:23,349
They come over and sit.

966
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:25,976
Okay.

967
01:34:29,522 --> 01:34:31,523
Don't you feel a little better?

968
01:34:51,042 --> 01:34:54,753
I got spring fever, we're going
to the lake. You wanna come?

969
01:35:03,513 --> 01:35:06,223
Lars, why don't you come with us?

970
01:35:06,391 --> 01:35:08,309
It would do everybody good.

971
01:35:15,607 --> 01:35:17,066
Bianca?

972
01:35:17,901 --> 01:35:20,320
Don't you wanna see
this beautiful day?

973
01:35:34,543 --> 01:35:37,545
- Is there a storm coming?
- The weather said no.

974
01:35:41,841 --> 01:35:43,717
Looks like a storm to me.

975
01:35:44,844 --> 01:35:49,056
Well, I need to stretch my legs.
Let's take a chance.

976
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:56,897
Lars?

977
01:36:00,318 --> 01:36:02,194
We're gonna watch the water.

978
01:36:03,236 --> 01:36:08,240
- We won't be far.
- Holler if you need us. - Okay.

979
01:37:57,055 --> 01:38:00,974
- You think it's not that color?
- It doesn't match the curtains.

980
01:38:01,851 --> 01:38:05,520
- I think so. Here, just be careful.
- Okay.

981
01:38:13,236 --> 01:38:14,403
Gus...

982
01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:20,326
No. Don't run. Lars!

983
01:38:22,412 --> 01:38:23,579
Lars!

984
01:38:49,188 --> 01:38:55,944
Lars asked us not to wear black today.
He did so to remind us

985
01:38:56,153 --> 01:38:59,197
that this is no ordinary funeral.

986
01:39:02,242 --> 01:39:06,620
We are here to celebrate
Bianca's extraordinary life.

987
01:39:09,124 --> 01:39:12,251
From her wheelchair,
Bianca reached out

988
01:39:12,919 --> 01:39:14,461
and touched us all

989
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:18,549
in ways
we could have never imagined.

990
01:39:20,635 --> 01:39:21,969
She was a teacher.

991
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:28,016
She was a lesson in courage.

992
01:39:33,355 --> 01:39:35,148
And Bianca loved us all.

993
01:39:37,234 --> 01:39:38,693
Especially Lars.

994
01:39:42,156 --> 01:39:43,823
Especially him.

995
01:40:29,785 --> 01:40:31,160
Hi.

996
01:40:31,370 --> 01:40:34,080
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry, I just...

997
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:40,753
I don't know, it's just funerals
and mom and dad, you know.

998
01:40:48,511 --> 01:40:51,513
- He's unbelievable, huh?
- He is.

999
01:40:57,603 --> 01:41:00,814
I wanted to thank you for...

1000
01:41:10,323 --> 01:41:11,365
Gus!

1001
01:41:14,619 --> 01:41:15,661
Yeah.

1002
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:21,000
So, shall we see you at the house?

1003
01:41:21,167 --> 01:41:23,502
- Of course.
- Okay. - Sure.

1004
01:41:53,615 --> 01:41:56,491
She asked me not to be sad,
but I can't help it.

1005
01:42:00,371 --> 01:42:01,955
Yeah. Me neither.

1006
01:42:05,627 --> 01:42:07,628
But it'll get better with time.

1007
01:42:10,131 --> 01:42:12,424
That's what everyone keeps saying,
so...

1008
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:17,220
It's true, I think, in a way.

1009
01:42:22,309 --> 01:42:24,644
But there'll never be
anybody like her.

1010
01:42:48,125 --> 01:42:49,876
I suppose we should

1011
01:42:51,879 --> 01:42:53,630
catch up with everyone.

1012
01:43:01,264 --> 01:43:02,931
Do you wanna take a walk?

1013
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:06,600
Yes.

1014
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,106
