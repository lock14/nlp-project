You know, sometimes...
you have to go|through something
to find out|why you did it.
There was a friend of mine|who worked on "24"
in the art department.
And we affectionately|refer to him as "dark Mark."
He was a rock and roll guy.
And I said, "Look,|we're starting this label
and we're looking|for a rock band."
He called me|about three weeks later
and said,|"I just saw this guy...
He plays a dobro
and he does this stuff|with pedal boards
and-- he's the most amazing|guitar player I've--
I've ever seen.
I remember|the first day we met.
We set up a meeting.
So the meeting didn't start|for less than five minutes
before they were, like,|calling us assholes
and that we would|steal all their music
and that we were gonna rip|them off and da-da-da-da.
And I remember, I went...
I went,|"Well, fuck you guys.
Get the fuck outta here."
And Jude was like, "No, no, no,|calm down, calm down."
And so Jude|finished the meeting,
and kind of|struck a deal that
we would start|to record stuff,
and at any point|if someone was uncomfortable
they would leave.
And...
a year and a half later,|we finished the record.
- Ironworks.|- It's me, Manu.
Oh, great, all right.
Hello, Manu.|Come on in.
Hi, how are you?|That's for you.
- Yes?|- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
You're welcome.|I'm from the South.
New Orleans.
This is the main|control room.
And there is|the main controller.
What's up?
- What are you doing?|- Good to see you.
How'd you feel|about last night?
It was all right.
Everyone seemed|to really like the show,
but I was fighting the sound|on the stage and the lights.
I thought you did|a great job.
- Yeah.|- I really do.
I thought the band|sounded amazing.
You guys are really tight.
- Yeah.|- I have one criticism...
your nervousness,|a little bit,
comes off with an edge like--|like you're pissed off or something.
I-- I get frustrated|really bad.
Yeah, and you gotta|channel that maybe
somewhere else,|you know?
I'm gonna try.
- Nice to see you.|- All right. You're good?
Yeah, I'm all right.|How are you?
- Good.|- Yeah?
Jesus.
That's the only time|I'll ever be able to do that.
The way this is worded--
There are two|areas in medical?
- Or two zones--|- Or two stations in medical...
- Two stations?|- Yeah, two stations are logged on--
Two stations are logged on,|one of them's medical.
- Yeah, perfect.|- Okay, two stations logged on, okay.
Cool.
What's that?
- Banana.|- That's that smoothie from last week?
- Uh-huh.|- No, I think I'll get a new one.
It's brand new,|it's brand new.
From last week.
I got one last week,
And this--|it looked the same. No.
You don't like them?|I thought you liked it.
You'll like it.|It'll make you better.
Stop.
Stay.
Here we go,|here comes the rehearsal.
Rehearsal!
- I want Eugene on that side.|- And action!
Well, I met a guy who|basically introduced me
to a lot of the Appalachian music|and claw hammer music.
The melodies were--|were simple and pure.
And the lyrics...
were...
borderline evil.
In my 27 years|of working here,
I always wanted to work|with an artist that natural to himself.
You know, as a producer,|it's very easy to look smart
because you're|working with something
that sort of shines|through any colors.
Probably his greatest|gift is his voice.
He just gets these|bell tones that...
most singers|just don't have.
You know,|that kind of stuff.
- Cut!|- That's a cut.
- That was an awesome take--|- Hey, Nick.
We're working 14 hours a day,|five days a week,
101/2 months a year, so...
I mean, I spend more time|here than anywhere else.
I got my "24" teddy bear.
This is my new|emotional partner.
The idea to go|to Europe with the band,
by the sheer nature|of what we're trying to do
in that 14 days--
we're gonna pack in|a lot of living.
It's like|living... concentrate.
I think the most excited|I've ever seen Kiefer
is him talking|about the tour
that he's gonna do with the band|that he's helping get off the ground.
So it's been really fun|to watch him
and watch his excitement|as it gets closer and closer.
I can listen|to a Beatles song
and it'll take me back to when|I was eight years old.
I can listen|to a Led Zeppelin song
and I could...
feel and smell|the first kiss in my life.
Music transports me|emotionally
faster than anything...
I know.
I played it for two people|who were very impressed,
but they didn't go|"Gotta have it."
And I asked one, like,|"You seem to really love this.
Why aren't you...?" He said, "Well,|how old is he?" I said "he's 28."
He goes, "Man,|the head of my label
doesn't wanna hear|about anybody over 25."
I went "Oh, okay, cool.|No problem."
You know? I mean,|what am I gonna say to that?
You know, it's just|an awareness
that pop radio is|about the kids right now.
And I understand that.
But we treat kids now|like they're so fucking stupid
we gotta pacify them|with this shit music.
It's like-- it's such|an insult to them.
He's certainly|got what it takes,
more than 99%|of artists that I see.
He's got the voice,|he's got the music,
the songwriting skills,|the guitar playing...
Rocco's future|is right before him.
He can take it|if he wants it.
And he can fuck it up|if he wants to.
I think it's his|to do either with.
As an artist,|I think he's absolutely pure.
There are times|in my life,
because I had kids,|because I was married,
because I made|other choices,
that I would take|certain jobs as an artist
that maybe weren't|the right thing to take.
Well, Rocco's|never done that.
I think they're all|incredibly talented.
I think everybody in the band|contributes an amazing amount
to this overall sound.
What I want-- people to see
this band play live.
I think that that in itself is such|an amazing experience.
At the end of the day,|you're not gonna be able to say,
"Well, the band just didn't cut it|or they didn't have it."
Because that's just|simply not the case.
They do have it and they can cut it.|So the only question mark...
is really... Is us,
and our ability|to get them out there.
And that's a responsibility|I really do take seriously.
- That sounds great.|- Sounds good, yeah?
Yeah. We've met Rocco.
That's Dave--|bass player.
- That's Eryun...|- What's up?
...on the drums,|and that's Greg,
master percussionist.
And the soul|of Ironworks, Mark.
Captain Mark.
Hold up, hold up.
That's where you go back|to the drum for me.
Right when the solo starts again,|boom. Big like that.
We just need to play|the whole song with more energy.
Try it in G,|just to humor me.
Before this,|I was working in a cubicle
as a transcriber|for reality television.
Horrible.
You know,|I had a normal job.
I was an operations manager|for a retail company...
for years.
I actually just|stopped working.
I was working actually part time.|I had to move back to my parents'.
I just couldn't|afford to, you know, live.
But hopefully,|I'll be out soon.
I've never been to Europe,|so this is so exciting for me.
This is gonna work.|It's all or nothin'.
And could you go|back to your old job?
I could,|but I never will.
None of us have|anything to lose.
We're just gonna play music|and do what we do best.
And hopefully,|people will dig it.
- Are you excited?|- Yeah.
You guys, like,|leave right way?
- Tomorrow.|- Ladies...
Hi, how are you?
The whole thing about|getting on that plane
and going to Europe--
I have no idea|what we're doing.
He's kind of playing|their tour manager.
Now, if you know|Kiefer well,
organization is|not his middle name.
- Merry Christmas|- Yeah.
You can book the dates,|and do the best job you can,
but hopefully you|have a scenario
that you might want to shoot for,|but even that--
I mean, the original plan|has already changed so much
and we haven't even|gotten on a plane yet.
Rocco?
Rocco?
Rocco, hey...
Hey, mate,|you have an interview.
Sorry about this.
Okay, so like, 45 minutes|in the lobby, okay?
Good? Okay.
And when staying|in a foreign country...
by yourself with|$40,000 worth of guitars,
lock your door.
Hey, come on in.
We might have|to hit your room.
I don't know if|both of us will fit.
How's it going?|Good?
Yeah, I think.
I mean, I had a wakeup call for 8:30,|which I never got.
Can you explain to me
what is this suitcase that|you carry everywhere?
- Which one? This one?|- Yeah.
My dad had|a case like that,
and he was very funny.
He used to carry it around and people|would always wonder what was inside.
I remember going|to nursery school with him,
and I just remember|how big his beard was.
And it was just after he finished|a film called "Kelly's Heroes,"
and he had|a leather jacket,
and I just-- I can smell the leather|off of that jacket.
And I remember|he was always laughing.
And I remember that case.
So I got one.
Rocco DeLuca|and the Burden--
the first time that|we will not have partnered
with a major label.
This is the artist|that we feel
most represents
what we believe|in creatively,
musically, and so
this is a very|exciting time for us.
If there is one musician
that you could|jam with or write with,
who would it be?
I've actually done it.
It was Johnny Cash, and I had|the opportunity to play with him.
It was amazing just|to see a true craftsman
and a true poet|really lay it down.
You smell better|than Rocco.
Yeah, you smell better|than Kiefer, by the way.
Here we go, guys.
I don't think we talked|specifically about
the borderline|at 9:30 tonight.
If she can tag that in the interview|at some point, that would be great.
We're going back|to the office now.
Great.|Okay, guys.
Do you guys|feel any pressure
about playing in London|for the first time?
Man, it's cold.
Do you have the number|for this place?
Hi. We are outside|the Borderline Club,
and we're the band|that's playing tonight.
And we had a 2:00 load-in,|and nobody's here.
Shall we go around|to the back door?
Our instruments|can't be sitting in this cold.
That'd fuck 'em up, man.
This is why|we need roadies.
So we're waiting|for Barry to come,
and I was wondering if you guys|got ahold of him yet.
Rocco DeLuca|and the Burden.
He just walked out the door.|He'll be here in a minute.
- I guess they're close by.|- Great.
Take Beste's guitar with you.|Stick it inside,
'cause I think the road cases|will be fine with Rocco's stuff.
- Barry?|- Ah, I'm Barry.
- Kiefer. How are you?|- Good to meet you, mate.
- Nice to see you.|- Nice to meet you. Cheers.
You guys were dropped off|at the wrong door.
I'll go around the back|and try to get all this lot open.
Yeah, it's way over|at the other side.
This says there is|going to be a band.
It says there is going|to be another band.
- It does?|- "Cheap Hotel."
- Do you know who they are?|- I have no idea.
I think anytime you play a big city,|it's an important concert.
Possibly the president|of Polydor Records might come out.
He's a big part of what we are going|to do over here,
So we need to impress a lot|of people.
On the advertisement card,
it says Rocco DeLuca|& Cheap Hotel.
The memo|we had sent was
"Rocco DeLuca|and the Burden,
and we need|a cheap hotel."
Well, we got|the cheap hotel.
Oh, we got the cheap hotel.|Yeah.
First with|just the band members.
Piss off.
No, I'm just kidding.
Fuck them.|I don't want them either.
Between Etta James and Aretha Franklin|and Billie Holiday,
the most beautiful|instrument in the world
was a black woman's voice.
They're just|angels to me.
Please give a warm|Borderline welcome
for Rocco DeLuca|and the Burden.
It's a London|crowd, man.
They take a lot|of work to get going.
At this stage in anyone's career,|I'm really hypercritical.
Constructive criticisms--|which is,
maybe change|the sound a little bit,
pace it|slightly differently,
but most importantly,
play at least|another 200 shows.
Tonight's audience
was one of the most|striking things I've ever seen.
When I see someone|on a stage
drop his heart|out there like that...
and it's like...
oh my God.
How are you feeling, guys?
That was a rough one, right?
Yeah, that's always|how it works, you know?
You fuckin'-- we've been talking|about this show from the beginning.
Always works out,|you know what I mean?
And when it gets built up|and there are so many fuckin' people
so we have to meet all these--|fuckin' photo shoots and everything.
Then you get up there|and do it and it's just like--
The beginning|was hard, right?
The whole fuckin'|thing was hard, man.
Was it the crowd|or something?
- The sound, the crowd--|- The sound was horrible onstage.
I'm gonna talk to Shannon.|I'm bummed.
They did very,|very well tonight.
I mean, for the first time in,|that was a cool show.
That was a cool show.
- Ow, that hurt.|- You all right?
Yes, sir.|Absolutely perfect.
We just took|London by storm.
Oy!
I want to make|a toast tonight...
I watched|a band tonight...
show some balls.
- What are they called?|- Cheap Hotel.
...DeLuca and the Burden.
And man, you did it.
Regardless of whether your audience|was involved or not...
they were just|so simply still.
Yodel, dude.
Give me one second.|I'm gonna go out here and practice.
You can yodel right here|right now if you're a man.
I know, but-- I'm try-- I need to get it|in my head first before I can do it.
It's not there yet.
I know how you|think it sounds--
- Argh!|- Just go for it, just loud and clear.
Fuck you. It's not|that simple, you cunt.
All right, I'm going.
Hey, Kiefer,|you're a pirate, man.
That would|explain everything.
Whoa!
Not funny.
How was your night, man?
- Fantastic.|- You had fun?
Yeah.|Phone charger.
Couldn't tell you|where the phone is.
But I know how to|power it when I find it.
They didn't|like the set list
because it was|a gradual build
and it took|too long to peak.
I just don't think you were|put here to please everybody.
You know?
That would be horrible.
You gotta have|some kind of a stand
and stand against|something as well.
And if you're not, then...
you're just|being accommodating.
- I'm nervous, actually.|- Why?
Because the week|before we left,
we had sold two tickets.
It's generally better if more people|show up than are in the band.
Ooh, there, look.
One of our taxis is here.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
The rest of it will be|coming from next door.
I'm gonna|go over right now.
I like the place,|very cool.
It's very|traditional looking.
I've heard some good|bands have played here.
Radiohead played|their show here.
I hope it sounds good.
This is a good spot.
It smells old.
This is awesome.
My concern is that|it's so close to Christmas
And this is|probably the city
that we have|the least contacts,
the least promotion.
We're gonna try and figure out|what we have to do
and if it's literally|just handing out flyers
or telling people about the show on|the street, then that's what we'll do.
We'll see.
They don't seem very concerned|about it though, do they?
Yeah, shit.
- How much is cover charge tonight?|- 20.
20 euros?|Are you kidding me?
Well, no wonder you're|having a hard time
getting people to come in here.|You're kidding me? 20 euros?
Kiefer wants|to speak to you.
Hey, man, it's Kiefer,|how are you?
Good.|I was just curious...
I heard that|the tickets were 20 euros
and I'm concerned about|not having very many people
show up at this show.
- To play in front of nobody?|- Right.
It's kind of a buzzkill.|It's fine though.
We'll have fun anyways.|It'll be fine.
We'll play to the bartender|and a couple of friends.
Do you have anybody|at any single radio station
that would be|interested in me
giving an interview|really quickly
and playing a track|or two off the CD
and explaining what|we're even doing here
and what this tour|is about?
Okay, mate, thank you|very, very much.
I really appreciate it.
Check, one, two.
Well, we just managed|to get the door price off the ticket
and we'll|take it from there.
Hi, Ruth.|How are you?
Oh, thank you.
I'm doing a tour with a band
and he's someone that we've spent|the last year making a record for.
It'll come out in March.
I've been carrying|most of the luggage
for the last little while, yeah.
Yeah, that's kinda my job.
Okay, well, Kiefer Sutherland,
it was a pleasure|to speak to you today.
- Well, thank you so much.|- Not at all.
Give us a quick plug again|for the free gig tonight.
Well, I hope maybe we|get a chance to see you
down there at Whelan's|at about 9:00.
And it's|a free concert and...
I think this is|one of the most
fantastic bands|that I've ever heard.
And I'd love you|to come down
and check it out|and see for yourself.
The legend, Kiefer,|lovely to talk to you.
Good luck with the band, good luck|with the new series of "24,"
good luck with everything.|We think you're great.
Oh, bless your heart.|Thank you so much.
And thanks for the support|and we'll talk to you soon, I hope.
- Cheers. Thanks, Kiefer.|- Take care.
I think there's gonna|be a point at some time...
ahem--
where it will be very obvious|for me to step back.
Tonight's not it.
Tonight we need all of us--|everybody who's on this trip
needs to kinda|help fill this place.
So that's what we're|gonna try and do.
Okay, let's give|out some tickets.
- Wanna go see a concert tonight?|- What concert?
- Rocco DeLuca and the Burden.|- Cool, man.
Free concert.|You wanna go?
- Yeah.|- You'll love it.
Would you guys|be interested in coming to see
- a rock show at Whelan's?|- Sure.
A friend of ours' band is|playing tonight at Whelan's--
- Rocco DeLuca and the Burden.|- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it's a phenomenal band.
That was good.|Let's go up this way.
You guys wanna see an amazing|rock and roll show tonight?
- What's the name of the band?|- Rocco DeLuca and the Burden.
- They'll blow you away.|- "24," it's coming on again?
Yep, February 12th.
...two tickets|to a show tonight at 10:00.
I work as an actor, yeah.
- Kiefer Sutherland. Nice to meet you.|- Oh, okay.
Onto the next stop.|We've got a band that's playing--
- What's your name?|- Kiefer.
- Yeah?|- Yeah.
Jack Bauer.
Or that, yeah.
This is classic.
You guys wanna go see|a concert tonight?
I am.|Nice to meet ya.
- You're not.|- Yeah.
- Yeah? Cheers.|- Take care, man.
You gotta learn how|to drink those faster.
If you're handing out|tickets to a free show,
no one believes|you're you.
So it's a new|device of mine...
It was very funny.|Dave started to make me laugh.
He said, "Thanks for|bringing me on this trip.
It's good to see that the label's|going so well.
Free concerts,|what a great idea."
The cab driver|actually asked, he said,
"So is this for|a charity or something?"
At least the rain stopped.
- It's gettin' packed.|- The press is here too.
- That's great, that's awesome.|- Yeah.
Fuck. You did good work|really quickly, man.
- Huh.|- You should be proud.
You did really|good work quickly.
I've known Rocco|for quite a while now.
I met him when|I was 13 years old.
Rocco is definitely|an interesting person--
very kind,|but he has this deep...
sense of pain|sometimes
that I don't even|know much about.
I think that fuels|some of his writing
and his passion.
It's very simple|to say, "Well, you know,
It's just a show, it's just|a rock and roll band."
But music|moves people, man.
And the more you travel about,|the more you see
how important|it fucking is, you know?
I think he's always known|that this is what he wants to do.
I don't think|he's had a normal job.
Thank you,|thank you.
Thank you for asking,|we appreciate it.
My father was|a traveling musician
and wasn't|around very often.
He had two brothers
who also played music.
So there was always|late-night jam sessions
and lots of interesting characters|hanging around.
My mother, I just met...
about three years ago.
All I had of her was...
a couple|of magazine covers.
She was a model|in Los Angeles... I guess.
She just wasn't ready to really|take care of a baby.
So my grandmother
took me out|of that situation.
I haven't seen|my mom since I met her
and I haven't seen my dad in about|three or four years now.
Do you have any|anger for your mother?
I don't have any anger|for her, no. Not at all.
So where does all this|anger in your music come from?
Well, maybe I do then.
It's not towards anybody.|It's a cry for help.
You know?
It's a cry--|it's a cry to be healed.
That's just the universe,
that's just|the way things work.
You gotta plant with|the blood, you know?
And... that's the only way|you'll get a soulful flower.
Thank you very much|for listening,
we appreciate it.|Rocco DeLuca and the Burden.
Yeah, yeah.
I can't thank you enough.
This is one of the most important nights|I've ever had.
Today at 1:00, we had two people|coming to the show.
And...
tonight we have|this audience
with a standing ovation|and the encore.
Congratulations.|You did it.
He's like a soul brother
who wants to journey|to the end of the night,
you know?|Who wants to see...
what this whole thing|is fucking about.
I'm impressed,|I'm proud, I'm all of that.
I just--|took my breath away.
This was like|a trigger for me.
I needed another gear.|I think you guys did too.
- Yeah.|- You know?
You guys played|your ass off.
- Thank you.|- It's all good.
- You broke my heart.|- Thank you.
We have a connection.|We both, you know,
had fathers,|I guess, that were...
always not around.|I don't know
if that has anything|to do with it.
I quit smoking|two months ago.
I didn't realize|how much I wanted it.
Not only for the label,|but for the band.
And not only for the band|but for the label.
What a night.
Kind of a big room.
I'm gonna go steal|some salt from the kitchen.
That's what you do at night|when you can't sleep?
Well, when I've|been up a few days,
and...
I'm singing|every night...
I just...
sometimes, need a little bit of--|should we go in there?
Yeah? I need|a little salt to...
to gargle.
For my throat.
John Lee Hooker|was a hero of mine.
And a little while ago
before he passed on,
I got to open up|a couple shows for him.
I remember|the first show I played...
I was at the Sun Theater
And I did|my sound check.
And I was about|to get off and...
I was playing|by myself and...
and John Lee Hooker|said "Hey, man."
He said "You go ahead|and sit in my chair
when you play, okay?"
And that was all he said.
I was really proud|to be a part of those shows.
It's very cool.
Very cool.
Good afternoon, reception.|How may I help you?
Everybody's sleeping.
I think. I don't know.
- Hello, camera crew.|- How you doing, dude?
I'm good, but I'm naked.|What's the plan?
We were supposed to|check out two hours ago,
- I know that much.|- Okay.
Hello?
Everyone looks|like they're beat.
Hey, David,|have you seen Kiefer?
Nobody's heard from him?|Aw, that's awesome.
- Hey, man.|- Hey, how you doing?
I see everybody's checking out|about three hours late.
- I know.|- They just talked to him.
He's up and he didn't|know what time it was,
or he would've been up
and gone to the library|and read a few books.
How you doing,|man, this morning?
I'm doing fine.|I just don't have enough luggage.
This is gonna be|a long trip downstairs.
Yeah.
That's attractive.
Now, undo all this|stuff to make sure
I haven't lost this phone.
It's upstairs.
I gotta find this phone.
Do you lose a lot|of stuff when you go out?
Two wives...
two lives...
yeah, I have.|I have.
Why do you let me|film you at night
when you do|all this crazy stuff?
I don't think|it's that bad.
Whatever, I mean,|I'm not here to judge that.
But why do you|let me film you?
Because this band|is worth seeing.
Yeah, but I don't need|that to see the band.
I can film the band.
I mean, usually famous people|try to be very private.
Why is that you let me|film you as you are?
Not the you-- a very strong actor|and professional--
but the you|in your private life,
going out, having fun|with your friends.
I don't know yet.|I'll have to think about that.
You coming?
What happened|to the sun, man?
The sun?|Bring on the night.
What time is it?
It's 9:35...
in the morning,|and it will stay like this...
well, till 12:00 or 1:00 actually,|in the afternoon.
And then...|black as night.
- Hello.|- Welcome, my name's Adel.
- I'm sorry?|- Adel.
Adel. Kiefer.|Very, very nice to meet you.
- You're the host of the show?|- Yeah.
My mother is a very|successful theater actor,
and both my parents|were incredibly supportive.
And they knew that it was going to be|very important for me
to make the mistakes|that I was gonna make early on.
You mentioned your mother,|Shirley Douglas.
And her father is one of the greatest|Canadians of all times.
He's called "the father|of Medicare in Canada."
"The father of Medicare|in Canada," yeah.
Have you ever thought|about going into politics?
I grew up in parliament
watching|my grandfather speak,
and it was not something|that I felt as comfortable with
as what I do now,|which is work as an actor.
- You were here last year.|- Mm-hmm.
And I think every|Icelander noticed that
because you were in the papers.|There were a lot of stories about you--
See, I can't read Icelandic.
When I was here, I didn't realize|I was in the paper that much.
Maybe you're lucky that|you can't read Icelandic.
Not that they were|bad stories,
but there were a lot|of stories about
your going out,|drinking
- and--|- Those are true.
They're all true?
Yeah, well, we went out|and we went drinking.
But, no, on some level obviously,
stories get exaggerated.
As for going out|and having--
at least what I consider|to be a fun time--
yeah, we did that.
Okay, that's your|Christmas present.
You all get a girl.
Don't say I never|did nothing for you.
- Aw, did I get the brunette?|- I knew you'd do it.
I'm sorry. Can I give you|my gift to you right now?
- You all get a girl.|- Oh, cool. Aw, you get the brunette.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Cool, dude.|Thanks.
That's my wrapping paper|inside there.
After this film,|I'm going to need this.
I love it.
We were talking about that|the whole time last night.
"I want to wish you the best of luck|out there in the big city.
I just hope you don't forget|the rest of us when you become famous.
Just go out there|and get 'em, kiddo.
Merry Christmas|and happy birthday."
- Hey, I love you to death.|- You too, man.
I wonder if anybody|reviewed the show.
I'd like to have that.|That'd be cool.
Be careful of that.
It's an old lesson.
Do your thing.
If you get|caught up in that,
Even if it starts|off really great,
if you believe that there,|then you've got to believe this here.
Just fuck 'em.
- Kiefer...|- Yeah.
What was Christmas|for you when you were a kid?
It was good.
It was either with|my mom or my dad.
The best Christmas|I ever had I was about 14.
- What happened?|- I had a girlfriend.
- oh, your first one?|- In Toronto, yeah. First serious one.
And I had a job|in a restaurant.
Yeah, I remember|feeling fiercely independent.
This parade.|Is this a traditional thing?
People walk down here?|Yeah.
Always to this one they're|peace walking--
The people|on the main street.
- Same time every year.|- Every year, yeah.
Tonight, we are having|a traditional Icelandic Christmas feast.
- Smoked goose.|- Smoked goose-- fantastic.
- Try it.|- This is my granddaughter.
- Hi. How are you?|- I'm fine.
- Nice to meet you.|- thank you.
I'm gonna get a water.
I want to get a--
You don't like goose?
- I don't like food.|- Why?
I've just never been|a food guy, you know.
Cheeseburgers and pizza|is pretty much the end of it for me.
No, I'm not going|to eat that right now.
- Why not?|- I'm not very hungry right yet.
I'm sorry.
What about|pickled goose?
- I had the goose.|- You had the goose?
I had the goose.
But this is|Icelandic traditional.
I'm going to try it.|I just need a minute.
- You need a minute?|- Just a minute.
- Merry Christmas.|- Merry Christmas.
Went to Rocco DeLuca,|had great concert.
Yeah, he had very good concert,|of course.
How do you fucking know?|You weren't there.
But I just know it.
The horses are approaching|the starting gate.
They're all in line.
All set...
And now, away they go.|All came out well.
On the outside we have|"Kid Shredding" and "Spaghetti Dancer."
Those two are fast.|Now "Superfluously" takes over.
"Paramour" in the orange|is giving up second
As "Big Fine" comes through|in the white blinkers to get third.
"Real Wild" showing speed|down at the rail in the white colors.
"Go Go Louie's" right there too,|with "True Pioneer,"
As they all bunch up|on the lead now.
Then comes Paramour,|the we drop back to Go Go Louie,
Racing four lengths|off the lead.
We come to the top of the lane.|It's wide open.
True Pioneer,|one from the rail width.
They come for home now! It's "Nash|Rudin" on the grandstand side,
Spaghetti Dancer in the black,|but Nash Rudin flying.
Spaghetti Dancer|trying to keep him off.
These two nose and nose,|Kid Shredding with a shot too
But it's going to be Nash Rudin,|and Nash Rudin goes on to score.
Okay, I still have to find it.|I think it's two more doors down.
You're lost, Kiefer?
- Nah?|- Where's the venue?
I've never been|here to this--
Here we are.
Get the fuck|out of here!
You get the fuck|out of here.
How are you?
This is where we're going|to load in through?
We're going to start|bringing in the equipment.
You can come|this way as well.
Yeah, we have the truck|backed up here,
- we're going to come right this way.|- Either way.
Ready to fight.|You ready?
One picture,|just you and me.
Well, you're too fucking big|to say no to.
Thank you|so much, mate.
Sing it. Come on,|it's too beautiful
It's funny|that they know this.
It's not as funny|as it was 10 years ago.
Viva la Iceland!
You should check|if you're here somewhere,
and Rocco.|Do you think you are?
It's not of great concern to me,|to be honest with you.
Oh, okay.
Ah, here you are.
- Aha.|- Dum-dum-dum-dum-da-dum...
"Heroes Also Fail."
Do you want me|to read this for you?
Not particularly. Do they talk|about the show last night?
Now somebody's going to write|about the actual concert.
That's what|I'm interested in, yeah.
And that's not|in the paper today.
I phoned her from England,|just to tell her
that we got to Europe safe,|and it was my birthday.
And she said,|"Have fun.
But remember,
Now you're 39."
Like that somehow was going|to magically make me...
"okay."
What did she mean?
Grow up.
In all fairness, my mother's|pretty much usually right.
- New tattoo, Kiefer?|- Hmm?
- New tattoo?|- Yeah.
It's "I Trust You|to Kill Me"
In Icelandic rune.
It means that I've already come|to terms with the fact
that you're|coming after me,
and there's nothing you can do now.|I've accepted it.
It means that whatever|it is I'm going to do,
I'm going to do|the way I see fit,
and the way|I think is right.
So you don't care about|what people think anymore?
No.
I think that's ridiculous.
Of course I care|what people think.
But I've accepted the fact
that some people aren't|going to like what I do.
And if I can|accept that now,
then it protects my ability|to go forward and do it.
The times that I've made|terrible mistakes as an actor
have been when I tried to do something|I thought someone else would like,
and it didn't come|from my heart.
And this tattoo will always|remind me of that now--
to not make|that mistake.
So this trip|is a passage
towards something|else for you?
It's becoming|that, yeah.
I wasn't as clear|about that when we started,
but it's definitely|becoming that now, yeah.
Kiefer put that tattoo|on his arm, man.
He put "I Trust You to Kill Me"|on his arm,
which, you know,
you could put|worse things on your body.
I mean it's-- this means something|to us. It matters, you know.
And he's-- you know--
that's one of his ways|of expressing that it matters.
It's a heavy deal.|It's good.
It's very good.
Isn't it beautiful?|I love it, man.
I want to go play|right now.
Heavy stuff, man.|It's crazy.
I'm glad we got|a chance to come here.
This is kind of|a symbolic place to be.
I don't know. We have our own walls|in the United States too.
And we have-- every country has|their own walls.
This is just a reminder
not to divide,|but to connect.
The "West Wonder"|McDonald's moved in.
Now I can go to East Germany and|get a fucking Big Mac.
Where's Starbucks?
If everything works out well, hopefully|one day there will be a Wal-Mart.
Certainly the idea|of making a film
about the band
was something that was|very interesting to me,
and I'm also at a point|in my life
where I'm discovering|a lot about myself.
I didn't think that would probably be|as much a part of this film
as it's kind of become.
Look, I've spent|most of my life
really protecting|my privacy.
The only time|that it's ever a problem
Is when I do something|really stupid
and I just end up|embarrassing my family.
And they don't|deserve that.
Some people might go,|"What a spoiled ass.
Privileged little prick."
And...
"It's not that hard,|get your shit together."
You know...
And whoever|does say that,
I'm right there with you.
You know, sometimes...
you have to go through something|to find out why you did it.
I don't completely get it.
It really has|almost everything to do
with just taking a chance|on something, finally.
Stop being so scared.
And if everybody ends up|not liking you because of it,
well, they weren't going to like you|for real anyway,
so there you are.
And right now|that's the best reason
I can tell you why I'm letting|you do this.
We'll be here|all week, folks.
Very interesting.
This is going to be|a strange setup.
- Where's the stage?|- Here and here.
Looks like more of a restaurant|than anything.
But I'm sure|it will be fun.
Oh, God.
What is that?
It's a piece of shit.
These are|the speakers here.
- You're kidding.|- It's not going to work.
We need to find somebody who|knows exactly what's going on here.
There's a little misunderstanding|where we're playing.
They're trying to get|ahold of Kiefer, I guess--
figure stuff out.
Pizza in Germany.|It's good.
You think the guys|are looking for you?
I think they were surprised|when they called upstairs
and said, "We're ready to go,"|and I said, "Good, go."
But this band|is proving themselves
show after show|after show after show,
and they are finding|an audience--
sometimes 300 people|at a time.
So they don't|need you anymore?
I was very aware|that there is a time
that I'm going to have to really|step out of the way,
because...
I'll be in the way.
I think there's another|stage downstairs.
Is there really?|Bigger?
Yeah, that's|what they told me.
- Wanna go look at it?|- Sure.
Yeah, this is more like it.
There's no point|in playing upstairs.
This looks like|it would be cool down here,
but upstairs|is ridiculous.
It's cool, but not|for playing rock, though.
When I was a kid,
my dad used to|tell this story
that-- when I was like|two or three years old,
and it was when my mother|and father split up--
I was running,|I was chasing something
and I ran into the wall.|I missed the door.
And my father started to laugh|really hard.
And he said|for about two months
I would just run
full force into a wall|just to make him laugh.
And, maybe...
the Christmas tree|is part of that.
So you wanted|to please your father,
because you were making him happy|when you were doing that?
I like watching|people laugh.
So what, next Christmas|you're not going to tackle a tree?
So that was my last|Christmas tree.
I hope.
- It's not a jazz combo.|- No, that's not how the place is.
I'm not going to play|for a dinner crowd.
It's not people in suits, having dinner|with their grandmothers.
Well, I'm telling you,|because you asked me.
We'll play downstairs after midnight,|or we just won't play at all.
And Kiefer can figure it out|when he comes.
Other than that, I don't want|anything to do with it.
- I'm pissed off about it.|- Why are you pissed off?
Don't be pissed off.|Everybody's trying to make it work.
- It's just been a hard one.|- Everybody's trying to make it work.
The guys here are really cool.|Obviously,
there's been a fuck-up somewhere.|Let's not try to be, you know--
Negative? No, I don't want|to be negative, but it's a rock show.
It needs to be treated|like a rock show.
Why don't you play|later downstairs?
- That's what I was saying.|- Ja.
- Thank you.|- I don't think it will be a problem.
- Rocco. Nice to meet you.|- Hildegard.
- It's all good.|- Okay.
Start drinkin'.
Good idea.
- Kiefer?|- Has been called.
I don't know.|He's supposedly on his way.
Ah, perfect.
Wow, this is|going to be good.
I'm just not going to play|for a dinner crowd.
Because that's like|happy hour to me.
That's like|background music,
And that's everything|I'm fighting against.
You either work it proper
or you don't work it at all.
Off to the white trash|fast food
for rock and roll.
New Year's Eve.
How are you doing|out there?
He unfortunately|broke his string,
so he's going|to take a second.
What time is it?
What?
5... 4... 3...
2... 1...
Happy New Year!
And here's one for the kids.|This is called "Soul."
Hey, Kiefer.|How you doing, man?
Just kidding.|I'm doing all right.
- Good.|- How are you?
- Good.|- I'm packing.
- Ready to go home?|- Yes.
After you bought that?
Like you wouldn't|fucking believe.
- Yes.|- Great.
You had a good night?
Yeah.
I'm trying to find stuff.
Yeah, I heard.
You lost your wallet?
Yes.
I'm not ready|to go back to L.A.
- Why?|- Now, look at this. Look.
Look at this.
The sun's out.|The snow's on the floor.
I don't know|anybody in town,
except for|a handful of people.
I think|that's kind of cool.
I don't want|to leave that.
Oh, my God.|Mr. Sutherland, how are you?
- Oh, good.|- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too. Cheers.|- Fantastic.
What a great way|to start my new year.
- Fantastic.|- Cheers. Oh, cool.
- All the very best to you.|- Thanks very much.
Kiefer Sutherland--!
So you found|your charger?
I never lost|the charger.
I lost the wallet,|the money and everything else.
I always had|the charger.
We'll just take everything|that we've been learning
and wait to finally|drop a record.
We'll give it a go,
and if doesn't work|we'll try again.
Fuck, I have to pack.
I need the microphone.
- I have it somewhere.|- Cool.
The receiver.|We have the cable.
- I'll find it.|- Thank you, my friend.
- See you later.|- See you downstairs.
- Are you packed?|- I'm going now.
My work is over.
It's never over.
You didn't figure that out|last night?
It's never over.
Oh, can I be|really annoying?
See.
- What?|- Oh, no, a picture.
- Sure.|- Fantastic.
- Thank you.|- Cheers.
- Cheers to you.|- Thank you.
- Bye bye.|- Bye.
What a gem.
