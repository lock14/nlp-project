1
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,327
- Good morning.
- Hey.

2
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:19,565
- Good morning.
- Hey.

3
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,898
- Hey.
- Hi.

4
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:29,858
- Dean Daniels?

5
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:31,521
- That'd be me.

6
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,007
- I got a note in my box that
said you wanted to see me.

7
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,585
- I sent out a lot of notes.

8
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:40,854
I need you to tell me your name.

9
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:42,484
- Oh, sorry.
Patrick Chibas.

10
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:44,850
- Oh, Patrick.
Great.

11
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,384
Come on in.

12
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:53,002
How was your summer?

13
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:55,334
- I waited tables
at this fusion place

14
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:56,486
in the East Village.

15
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:58,724
- Good money?
- Yeah.

16
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,271
Am I in trouble?

17
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:05,181
- No, no.
Not at all. No.

18
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:08,185
You declared
an environmental sciences major

19
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,176
last spring?

20
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:10,646
- Yeah.

21
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:13,716
- Well, we have a scholarship
that's designated for--

22
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:15,089
well, it's designated

23
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,007
for an outstanding
minority student

24
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:18,318
in environmental sciences,

25
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,429
and I just wondered
if you might be interested.

26
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,546
- Sure.

27
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:23,241
- Well,
there's just one thing then.

28
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:24,360
I need to ask you, Patrick,

29
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:26,470
On your Belmont application,
you--

30
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,355
well,
under the voluntary disclosure

31
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:30,050
of your racial/ethnic
background,

32
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:32,639
you marked "other."

33
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,675
- Yeah.
I'm New Yorican.

34
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:38,201
- New Yorican?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:41,141
A New Yorker
of Puerto Rican descent.

36
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:43,859
- Right.

37
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,458
Do you think--
uh...

38
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,407
would it be fair
for me to say, then,

39
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:49,325
that you're hispanic?

40
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:51,243
- What's wrong
with New Yorican?

41
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:53,512
- Well, nothing,
of course.

42
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:55,399
- Then why don't you
just say that?

43
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,732
- Because the scholarship
committee is--

44
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:02,271
well, they're not
culturally sensitive,

45
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:04,637
if you know what I mean.

46
00:06:04,638 --> 00:06:05,852
- No.

47
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:07,929
- They're old,
and, just trust me on this,

48
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,943
the simpler the better
with these folks.

49
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:13,075
- You do understand
why I don't want

50
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:15,696
to be called hispanic,
don't you?

51
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:16,751
- Well, as I understand it,

52
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,255
and correct me,
please, if I'm wrong,

53
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:20,173
it's because
it really only refers

54
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:22,858
to imperialists
of European descent

55
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:24,327
who colonized Puerto Rico.

56
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:26,501
- Yeah, I mean,
if you understand, then--

57
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:27,908
- Then why am I suggesting it?

58
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:28,930
That's a good question.

59
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,081
You're right.

60
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:32,384
I shouldn't compromise
your feelings

61
00:06:32,384 --> 00:06:34,077
for the sake of expediency.

62
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,260
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,155
- That's okay.

64
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,926
- How about
just plain Puerto Rican?

65
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:40,982
- No.

66
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:45,170
- It's a $12,000 scholarship,
Patrick.

67
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,384
- It is?

68
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,813
- You are a remarkably talented
student, Patrick,

69
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:50,764
and I think
you should be rewarded

70
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:52,617
in a meaningful way.

71
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:58,211
- You can put "Puerto Rican."

72
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,162
- Thank you.

73
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,531
- # and that was just the way #

74
00:07:05,532 --> 00:07:08,504
# you play the game #

75
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:12,595
- Fuck.

76
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:17,167
- Dean Daniels.
- Yeah.

77
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:18,701
- I'm Nathan Glazer, the R.A.

78
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:20,235
Security's waiting inside.

79
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:22,793
- And the student?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:23,975
- What's his name?

81
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,246
- Simon Brick.

82
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,301
- Thanks.

83
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:38,104
- They're right in here.

84
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:40,598
- And neither of you guys heard
anything last night?

85
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:41,684
Hey.

86
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:42,675
- Oh, hello.

87
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:45,425
Sarah, this is Jason...
- Thorn.

88
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:46,959
- He found the note.

89
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,435
- You must be Simon.

90
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:53,831
- How'd you guess?

91
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:58,211
- I'm Sarah Daniels,
the Dean of Students.

92
00:07:58,212 --> 00:07:59,810
Are you okay?

93
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:02,366
- I guess.

94
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:03,837
- What did the note say?

95
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:05,978
Uh, <i>notes,</i> plural.

96
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:10,198
- He found
the other one last week.

97
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,007
- Why didn't you tell someone?

98
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:26,213
- I just figured
some asshole put 'em there.

99
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,003
- That's an understatement.

100
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:29,058
This is serious shit.

101
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,943
- I didn't want
to make a big deal.

102
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,319
I just got here.

103
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,035
I don't want everyone
to know who I am like that.

104
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:36,729
- So you don't have a roommate?

105
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,688
- I live next door.

106
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:38,839
- No, this is a single.

107
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,182
- Did you request it?

108
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:41,269
- Yeah.

109
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,579
- You're lucky, man.

110
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,305
My roommate stinks,
literally.

111
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,264
His--his feet--

112
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:46,990
- Okay.

113
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:51,466
More to the point...

114
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:52,809
we're gonna find out
who did this,

115
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,717
and we're gonna put an end
to it.

116
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:01,023
Would you like
to talk to somebody,

117
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:02,877
maybe go see one
of the counselors

118
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:04,252
over at Student Health?

119
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:08,120
- You know,
I think I'd really just like

120
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,207
to go to class.

121
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:15,120
- If there's anything
that I can do,

122
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,655
call me.

123
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:22,313
Thank you.

124
00:09:22,314 --> 00:09:23,686
Thanks.

125
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:35,930
- Has anyone had a run-in
with Simon?

126
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:36,922
- The opposite.

127
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,200
Everybody seems to like him.

128
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:40,277
I made a point of asking him
to meals the first week

129
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:41,524
since he didn't have a roommate.

130
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,920
He's real shy.

131
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,008
- Okay.

132
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:47,789
Well, call us if you think
of anything.

133
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,324
- You could, uh, put guards
at the doors

134
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:51,721
is something I thought of.

135
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:54,629
- Yeah, I'd have to clear it
with President Garvey.

136
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,859
And tell your freshmen not
to prop the doors open, hmm?

137
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,072
- Thanks, Nathan.

138
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,078
Let's make copies
of those notes,

139
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,348
and then you can give
the originals to the police.

140
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:05,722
- You want me
to call the police?

141
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:08,823
- Of course.

142
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:10,101
What?

143
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:13,426
- President Garvey will want
to handle it internally.

144
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:15,726
- He's being threatened.

145
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:17,103
- It's up to you.

146
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:21,513
- Call the police.

147
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:22,728
- Yes, ma'am.

148
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,820
- These winter term classes
are an embarrassment.

149
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:29,057
Wine tasting?

150
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:31,007
The films of Brigitte Bardot?

151
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:32,510
- I teach that.

152
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:34,204
- Well, we can't be
too demanding

153
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:35,514
in the winter term.

154
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:36,889
- Why not?

155
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:42,036
- Because it is one month
in the winter,

156
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:45,392
and that's when they all ski,
all right?

157
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:48,142
67% of students surveyed said
the ski slopes

158
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:50,124
were a deciding factor
in choosing Belmont

159
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,232
over competing colleges.

160
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:55,013
You're late.

161
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:57,762
- There's a problem.

162
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:58,977
- God.

163
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,964
- I have never seen anything
like this before.

164
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:05,946
- Is he all right?
Is he frightened?

165
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:09,078
- I mean, we might as well be
in Mississippi, 1963.

166
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:13,746
All we need is guys with hoods
burning crosses on the quad.

167
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:15,600
- Is that a plan?

168
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,975
- It had to be someone
from town.

169
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,020
- Oh, because rural America
is racist?

170
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,097
- Because it couldn't
be someone from here?

171
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,600
- What do we do?

172
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,551
- President Garvey is speaking
in Boston.

173
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:26,500
I can't call him
for another hour,

174
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:29,792
so it gives us time
to come up with something.

175
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,633
Jeffrey, give me Rita Chambers
in the press office.

176
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:38,199
- I bet they don't do
a damn thing.

177
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,213
- I bet they'll expel him.
- Or her.

178
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:42,291
- We have to let people know
this isn't Belmont.

179
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,241
We should issues some sort
of a statement right away

180
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:45,648
condemning this.

181
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:47,757
- Well, shouldn't we try
to find out who did it first?

182
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:50,346
- They should have
an all-campus meeting,

183
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:51,593
get it out in the open.

184
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:52,552
- I bet you they call one

185
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:54,629
of those useless
all-campus meetings.

186
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,867
- An all-campus meeting.

187
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:59,010
That feels like the kind
of response we should have.

188
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,033
Doesn't it?
- Yeah.

189
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:01,951
- In case any
of the parents call.

190
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:04,507
- You could sell it
as a learning experience.

191
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:06,297
- It is a learning experience.

192
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:07,895
- And it will get everybody
on board, too,

193
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,142
in terms of protecting the boy.

194
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,804
- Like a neighborhood watch.

195
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:11,763
- We'll cancel classes

196
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,170
and hold the meeting
this afternoon.

197
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:14,224
- I think we should wait.

198
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,175
- Why don't we call it a forum?

199
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:17,741
- A forum on race.
Good idea.

200
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:20,107
- Wait, wait.
Wait a second.

201
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:23,367
We should speak to Simon first.

202
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,988
What if he doesn't want us
talking about him this way?

203
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:26,947
- Why wouldn't he?

204
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:28,673
- It might be embarrassing
for him.

205
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:29,824
He's very quiet.

206
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:31,390
Everybody will stare.

207
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:32,956
- No one will stare.

208
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:35,034
- Now, who's going to speak
at this forum.

209
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:37,144
- You should, Catherine.
You're Dean of the College.

210
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:38,455
- I'd like to put my name in.

211
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:40,691
- You'll want
an African-American up there.

212
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,609
- There's the chaplain.

213
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,368
- Who else?

214
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,159
- There's Ellen Jenkins
in Economics.

215
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:51,177
Hmm.

216
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,419
- Uh, Dean Kenney,

217
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,337
One of the guys from
the police department's here,

218
00:12:58,338 --> 00:12:59,296
wants to talk to you.

219
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:00,671
- The police?

220
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:02,333
You called the police?

221
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:04,124
- Yeah.

222
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,850
- I told him to.

223
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,352
- Never do that.

224
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,333
It'll be in the local press,

225
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:11,219
and then the wire services
will get hold of it,

226
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,265
and then we're
everybody's business.

227
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,577
How can you be so stupid?

228
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:16,173
- Those notes are violent.

229
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:17,836
- It is an internal incident.

230
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:19,882
<i>Internal.</i>

231
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,886
You have really overstepped
your bounds this time, Sarah.

232
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:23,974
- Officer Olson wants--

233
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:25,030
- Tell him to wait.

234
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,879
I better not see any press
on this campus.

235
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:39,285
- Hey.

236
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,587
You did the right thing
calling the police.

237
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,665
- You couldn't have said
that back there?

238
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,957
- You still have the spark
of life left in you.

239
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,172
Just give it a couple of years

240
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:50,250
and you too will join the ranks
of the walking dead.

241
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:58,401
Is that a reporter?

242
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,863
Oh.

243
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:02,013
- No.

244
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:04,348
He just plays one on TV.

245
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:07,672
- I don't know.

246
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:09,685
I think the whole campus
is in shock, you know.

247
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:11,187
- Mm-hmm.

248
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:13,170
Are you in shock?

249
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,129
- Well, yeah.

250
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:15,599
Yeah, but I'm more curious,

251
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,060
you know,
because historically speaking,

252
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:20,777
<i>The Story of Little Black Sambo</i>
was a metaphor

253
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,016
for imperialism
in East India, you know.

254
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:24,133
So I'm wondering,

255
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:28,418
well, when did Sambo come
to mean, um...

256
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:30,432
oh, um, you know, I...

257
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:32,189
- Sambo.

258
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,340
- Sambo.
Yeah, Sambo.

259
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,225
- Okay, can we please stop
saying "Sambo."

260
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:37,304
- Excuse me.

261
00:14:37,305 --> 00:14:38,678
Hi.

262
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:41,651
Can I help you?

263
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:42,993
- I don't know.
Who are you?

264
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:44,207
- I'm Sarah Daniels.

265
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,902
I'm the Dean of Students.
Who are you?

266
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:48,204
- Aaron Carmichael.

267
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:50,312
Didn't--

268
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:52,327
I used to watch you
in Chicago, didn't I?

269
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:55,076
Action News Team Channel 3
was my first job.

270
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:56,035
- That's right.

271
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:57,665
So what are you now,
with CNN?

272
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,830
- I'm with Channel 6
in Burlington.

273
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:03,036
- Channel 6 in Burlington.
Wow.

274
00:15:03,037 --> 00:15:03,995
Good for you.

275
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:05,496
- Hmm.

276
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:06,936
- Uh, so...

277
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:09,046
are you interviewing these guys?

278
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:11,219
- Well, I'm here to do a story
on what happened

279
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,466
on campus last night.

280
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,759
The station got
an anonymous call this morning.

281
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,667
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

282
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,010
- Absolutely.

283
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:21,736
- You guys can go back
to class.

284
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:23,270
- All right.

285
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,764
- I wonder if you might
hold off on this thing.

286
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,522
The student
to whom this happened

287
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:36,248
really doesn't want
any attention.

288
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:38,294
- Oh, I'd never reveal
his name,

289
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:40,019
but this is quite a story.

290
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,177
A hate crime in Belmont College,
bastion of liberal idealism,

291
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,614
it's ready-made.

292
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:48,458
- Ready-made for what?

293
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,784
- So how is the college
responding to this incident?

294
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,875
- We're having a...
Um...

295
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:57,154
A race forum.

296
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,232
- And what's that?

297
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,958
- A forum...

298
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,908
on race

299
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:05,497
so we can discuss
the incident

300
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,151
and the surrounding issues

301
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:09,205
of race.

302
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:10,452
- Hmm.

303
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:12,082
So the usual lip service?

304
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,542
- Uh, no comment.

305
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:19,497
- Off the record.

306
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:20,840
- Off the record?
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:22,981
- I don't want to lose my job.

308
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,065
- Well, take my card then.

309
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:29,535
You'll want to talk to me

310
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:32,029
when those other vultures
descend.

311
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,138
So what'd you do in Chicago?

312
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,758
- I was Dean of Students
at Lancaster College.

313
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,148
- At Lancaster?

314
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,682
How long have you been here?

315
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:44,430
- I'm just starting
my second year.

316
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:45,646
- Well, it's, uh...

317
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,532
it's definitely a step up.

318
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:50,824
- Let's just say
it's different.

319
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:54,564
It's night and day.

320
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:01,629
- Belmont will not be reduced
to this trash.

321
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,643
Ours is a noble tradition
of learning, of truth,

322
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:05,337
most importantly,

323
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:07,926
of tolerance.

324
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,579
Armed with that tradition,
Belmont

325
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,072
will rise to this challenge.

326
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,908
Armed with that tradition,
she will prevail.

327
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:19,050
Now, we often speak
of the student body,

328
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:21,639
and I've always responded
to that expression,

329
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:26,402
"for this college is nothing
without all of you."

330
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,424
If Belmont has a heart,

331
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,663
it is her students.

332
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:35,385
And today Belmont's heart
beats stronger than ever.

333
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,266
- I thought Ellen Jenkins
was going to be up here.

334
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:43,312
- She declined our invitation.

335
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,134
- Oh?

336
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:46,796
- So did Simon Brick.

337
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:32,348
- Thank you, President Garvey,
for that generous introduction

338
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:34,266
and for your sterling leadership

339
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:36,630
during these trying times.

340
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:39,732
Like all of you,

341
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,417
I am shocked
by what has happened

342
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:44,015
to one of our students.

343
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:46,508
If truth be told,

344
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,841
we are a family,

345
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:52,870
and so we must ask ourselves
some difficult questions.

346
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:55,139
Have we done our best

347
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,824
to protect our brothers
and sisters?

348
00:18:57,825 --> 00:19:01,563
Or has our silence
made us culpable?

349
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:05,272
We need to look inside
our hearts this afternoon

350
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:07,606
and ask the question,

351
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:10,227
is my conscience clear?

352
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,282
- And now Chaplain Scott
will close

353
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,817
with a nondenominational
statement

354
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:21,831
of universal spirituality.

355
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:23,013
Chaplain.

356
00:19:23,014 --> 00:19:24,227
- Thank you.

357
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,096
We used to call it a prayer.

358
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:32,028
If we might have a moment
of silence.

359
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:43,535
May the spirit of acceptance
touch each of you,

360
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:45,709
and may our wishes
for peace be granted.

361
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,381
- You're not staying
for the end.

362
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:56,033
- Oh.
I always skip the credits.

363
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:57,887
- Well, President Garvey
authorized overtime

364
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:00,061
for one guard
outside Houtman Hall.

365
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:01,212
- One guard?

366
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:05,175
But there must be four
or five entrances.

367
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:07,126
- I've worked here 20 years,
Sarah,

368
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:08,852
and one thing I've learned,

369
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:10,131
these people
don't know their ass

370
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:11,346
from a hole in the ground.

371
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:12,720
- Uh.

372
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:15,181
Thanks.
- Yeah.

373
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:17,322
- Is he saying
that I'm somehow responsible

374
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:19,144
for what happened to Simon,

375
00:20:19,145 --> 00:20:21,478
I mean,
just because I'm white?

376
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,820
- At least he talked to you.

377
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,483
I'm the invisible man.

378
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,529
- I thought we'd get to talk.

379
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,991
- That was
just apologist bullshit.

380
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:30,652
- Well, problem solved.

381
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:32,410
- And what's the college doing
to diversify?

382
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,169
- I know that they're
recruiting heavily

383
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,023
and they've built
these affinity houses.

384
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:37,173
- Yeah, what's that?

385
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:38,580
- Residences
for different groups,

386
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:40,178
like if all
the Pan-Asian students wanted

387
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,375
to live together,
explore their culture,

388
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,517
cook pad thai, wear sarongs.

389
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:46,859
- Yeah, but...

390
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,681
- if you didn't know
what they were going for,

391
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,088
you might call it segregation.

392
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,111
- Uh, Ellen.

393
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:53,317
- Dr. Jenkins.

394
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,362
It's good to see you.

395
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:56,960
I don't believe I've ever met
your husband.

396
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:59,614
- He's not my husband.
- I'm not her husband.

397
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,915
- Oh.
Oh, my mistake.

398
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,345
- I'm not married.

399
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,590
- Have we met?

400
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:07,988
- Aaron Carmichael
from Channel 6 in Burlington.

401
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:11,154
- A reporter.

402
00:21:11,155 --> 00:21:12,272
Were you here today?

403
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:13,679
- I was.

404
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,395
- Did someone invite you?

405
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:21,159
- Actually, Dean Daniels
mentioned it to me.

406
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,852
- Sarah,

407
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,418
Join us.

408
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,112
- Thank you for your time.
- My pleasure.

409
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:32,411
- You know this gentlemen?

410
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:34,425
- Well, we met this morning.

411
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,429
In fact, Dean Daniels
was doing her level best

412
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,506
to kick me off campus,

413
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,287
all the while remaining
unfailingly polite.

414
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:45,516
- Well, in the future,
we would appreciate it

415
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:48,521
if you arranged all interviews
through our press office.

416
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:50,535
- I'll keep that in mind.

417
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:51,973
Now, if you'll excuse me...

418
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:53,508
Thanks.

419
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,088
- I told you this would happen.

420
00:21:59,071 --> 00:22:02,426
- So racism is a bad thing?
- Indeed.

421
00:22:02,427 --> 00:22:03,545
- Huh.

422
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,719
- And behold,
they heave their collective sigh

423
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,348
of white guilt,

424
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:10,129
and then they drive downtown
in their Saabs and buy sweaters.

425
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:15,116
Cheryl's making up some pasta
if you want to come over.

426
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:17,482
- Don't you two ever want
to be alone?

427
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,080
- No.

428
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,200
- Hmm.

429
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,829
Well, I feel like I should be
paying you rent.

430
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,300
- You need to get out more.

431
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:25,825
- Where to?

432
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:28,062
I...

433
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,757
I'll see you in the morning.

434
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:31,450
- Dean Daniels.

435
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:34,551
Dean Daniels.

436
00:24:34,552 --> 00:24:35,670
This is lucky.

437
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,236
I was gonna come by your office.

438
00:24:37,237 --> 00:24:39,315
I'm Greg...
Sullivan.

439
00:24:39,316 --> 00:24:40,593
- Greg.

440
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:42,192
- Well, no need to stop.

441
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:43,949
- Oh, okay.

442
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,314
- I just, uh, wanted to talk
to you about last week's forum.

443
00:24:46,315 --> 00:24:48,072
I thought it
was really instructive.

444
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:50,215
- Oh.
I'm glad you thought so.

445
00:24:50,216 --> 00:24:51,429
- Yeah,
it got me so worked up

446
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,315
to talk
about this Simon Brick issue.

447
00:24:53,316 --> 00:24:54,658
Everybody else too.

448
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,904
- Uh-huh.

449
00:24:55,905 --> 00:24:58,398
- But, uh, I feel like
the momentum's dying out,

450
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:01,146
so I had an idea.

451
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:02,713
I want
to start a discussion group...

452
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:04,439
- Oh?
- To keep people talking.

453
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,527
- Oh.
- I was thinking

454
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:08,084
about calling it
Students for Tolerance.

455
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:10,193
- Oh.
- What do you think?

456
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,792
- It, uh...

457
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:13,838
it's a good idea, actually.

458
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,148
- Excellent.

459
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:18,312
Uh, so how does
something like that get

460
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:19,655
to be official?

461
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:22,692
- Uh...

462
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,290
does it have to be official?

463
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,665
- Yeah, just to get a room.

464
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:28,286
- Okay.

465
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:29,372
Uh...

466
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:31,993
well, uh, first you need
a faculty sponsor,

467
00:25:31,994 --> 00:25:35,894
and then, um,
the Student Activities Committee

468
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:37,619
gives you an account
and a space.

469
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,802
- And at that point,
could I say

470
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,144
that I'm the founder
and president

471
00:25:40,145 --> 00:25:42,030
of Students for Tolerance.

472
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:44,332
- Uh.
I don't see why not.

473
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,866
- I'm applying
for law school next year,

474
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:48,168
and I'm a little short
on the extracurricular,

475
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:49,224
if you know what I mean.

476
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:51,110
- I see.

477
00:25:52,453 --> 00:25:54,913
Hey, uh...

478
00:25:54,914 --> 00:25:58,653
why don't you ask Dean Strauss
to be your sponsor?

479
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:00,124
- That's a great idea.

480
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,658
- Yeah, I thought
you might like it.

481
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:02,905
- Thanks,
Dean Daniels,

482
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:05,333
and, uh, nice pace.

483
00:26:09,746 --> 00:26:11,311
Ah, whatever.

484
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:46,123
- Dean Kenney,
how are you?

485
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:47,305
- Not well.

486
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,455
- Dean Daniels,

487
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:49,735
I'm Mike Olsen,
Belmont police.

488
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,067
- Oh, how do you do?
- Pleasure.

489
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:56,127
- Where's Simon?

490
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,726
- In my room.
- Oh.

491
00:26:57,727 --> 00:26:59,675
- It must have happened
while we were at breakfast.

492
00:26:59,676 --> 00:27:00,794
- The guard was probably

493
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:02,074
on the other side
of the building.

494
00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:03,799
- Here's the rock.

495
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,324
- Very helpful.

496
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,211
- Excuse me.

497
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:09,265
- You know, uh,

498
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:11,119
cameras would solve
this whole problem

499
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,037
inside and out.

500
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,585
- Why not razor wire
and guard towers?

501
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:17,480
- Catherine.

502
00:27:23,364 --> 00:27:24,864
- We are already
in the Boston papers.

503
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:26,559
Are you aware of that?

504
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,723
"Racial Incident at Belmont."

505
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:32,312
"Racists Run Belmont Ragged."

506
00:27:32,313 --> 00:27:34,103
And that reporter friend
of yours wants

507
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:37,107
to bring a camera crew
to the next forum.

508
00:27:37,108 --> 00:27:39,249
- Well, what's the point
of another forum?

509
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:42,062
- How else are we going
to have a dialogue?

510
00:27:42,063 --> 00:27:43,405
- Well, we could talk
to each other

511
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:45,290
instead of being talked at.

512
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:46,857
Public dialogue
is never real dialogue.

513
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:49,925
Nobody will admit
to anything in a crowd.

514
00:27:49,926 --> 00:27:51,460
- Well, that reporter's
gonna be there,

515
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,675
so I can only hope you're right.

516
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,005
- I told Simon we can
just switch rooms for a while.

517
00:27:59,006 --> 00:28:01,337
- Why don't you take him up
on it?

518
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,301
- My dad's always told me

519
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:08,625
that we can afford
to do what we want,

520
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:11,120
but if you want to live
in that neighborhood

521
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:13,325
or go to that school,

522
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:15,947
you have to be prepared
for ugliness,

523
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:19,302
and you can't let it bother you.

524
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:23,298
So if I go home
or change rooms even,

525
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:25,696
I'm letting it bother me.

526
00:28:25,697 --> 00:28:27,549
- you're letting them win.

527
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,833
- but I want to win.

528
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:35,061
- well, I think it's coming
along just fine.

529
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:36,501
More details, okay?
That's it.

530
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:37,714
More--oh, excuse me.

531
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,769
Sarah.

532
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,889
- Burton.

533
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,838
- a young man, Greg Sullivan,
has asked me

534
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,852
To sponsor his students
for tolerance group.

535
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:45,482
He said you recommended me.

536
00:28:45,483 --> 00:28:47,720
- Well, you seemed
like an obvious choice to me.

537
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:49,479
- We'd be honored
if Simon Brick would attend

538
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,501
our first meeting,

539
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:52,003
but he won't return any
of my calls.

540
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:53,410
- I doubt he wants to come.

541
00:28:53,411 --> 00:28:54,912
- Would you ask him?

542
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:56,766
- I'd rather not.

543
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,876
- But you're our liaison.

544
00:28:58,877 --> 00:29:01,465
- What?
- To the minority students.

545
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:06,579
- Wha--what the hell does
that mean?

546
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,754
- Never mind.
I'll keep trying him myself.

547
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:18,854
- My dad said I should insist
on talking to you right away.

548
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:23,489
When I got the scholarship,
they took away my financial aid.

549
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,896
It's costing more now.

550
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,558
- That's not right.

551
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,084
- My dad is furious.

552
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:31,161
He was already mad
about the whole hispanic thing.

553
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:33,813
He said I shouldn't have to make
compromises to get something.

554
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,467
- Maybe I should call him
and try to explain.

555
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:38,066
- And then I told him
about Simon Brick,

556
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,888
and he completely freaked.

557
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:42,509
He said that's exactly why
he didn't want me to come here.

558
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,075
- He didn't want you
to come here?

559
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,249
- But I wanted a change
of scenery,

560
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,157
you know,
or just some scenery, period.

561
00:29:49,158 --> 00:29:50,915
But now with this financial aid
letter, I--

562
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,610
- Don't worry, okay?

563
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:54,272
I will straighten this out.

564
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,990
What?
Is there something else?

565
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:07,698
- Some of my friends asked me
to come here and talk to you

566
00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:11,342
about that forum thing we had
to go to.

567
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,771
We felt like it
was really insulting.

568
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,178
- You mean
the minority students?

569
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,511
- No, I mean--

570
00:30:17,512 --> 00:30:19,174
What?

571
00:30:19,175 --> 00:30:21,859
You think all my friends
are minority students?

572
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,447
- No, I just--I just thought
that's what you meant.

573
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,406
- Why?

574
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,868
Because hispanic people
stick together?

575
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,563
- No, I just--

576
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:31,192
I didn't--

577
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:36,020
I wasn't thinking, like,
you and your <i>amigos</i> or anything.

578
00:30:36,021 --> 00:30:37,394
That was a joke.
I was making a joke.

579
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:38,449
- It wasn't funny.

580
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,600
- My god, Patrick.
I'm sorry.

581
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:40,941
- And I didn't correct
you before,

582
00:30:40,942 --> 00:30:43,052
but it's "students of color,"
not "minority students."

583
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:44,714
Students of color.
Of course.

584
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:47,335
I just--the minority thing,
you know,

585
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:49,829
it's--it's a--
it's a technical thing.

586
00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:52,353
You know paperwork:

587
00:30:52,354 --> 00:30:54,079
Everything has to fit
into a box.

588
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,966
- Is that why you made me say
I was Puerto Rican?

589
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,469
- You know, Patrick,
I wasn't trying

590
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,810
to make you say anything.

591
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:01,624
I just wanted to make sure
you got the scholarship.

592
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:02,967
- So it was a compromise.

593
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:04,885
- No,
not a bad compromise

594
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:06,035
like your dad meant,

595
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:08,689
but a good compromise,
between the two of us,

596
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,259
that you agreed to.

597
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,433
- Right.

598
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:16,584
- Look, Patrick.

599
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,630
I really am on your side.

600
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:21,603
Everyone who recommended you
says you are

601
00:31:21,604 --> 00:31:26,174
an exceptional student,
smart, and talented.

602
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:31,511
So just let us give you
the $12,000, okay?

603
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:35,028
- Okay.

604
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:36,339
- And don't be shy.

605
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,110
You go to the next forum,
and you tell them how you feel.

606
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,673
- We must rebuild
our community,

607
00:31:45,674 --> 00:31:46,823
and to do that,

608
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:49,987
we must rebuild our sense
of trust.

609
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:51,587
I know we can
count on all of you

610
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:54,176
to help us in this effort.

611
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:56,829
The safety of our students

612
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,280
is a paramount concern
to all of us here today.

613
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:01,880
And you have our word:

614
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:05,811
The miscreant responsible
for this second heinous act

615
00:32:05,812 --> 00:32:07,634
will be discovered.

616
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:12,588
- Miscreant?

617
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:14,250
- Heinous.

618
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:19,781
- And now I believe
Dean Strauss has a few words.

619
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:26,845
- Thank you, President Garvey.

620
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:32,343
I'd like to begin this afternoon
with a story that--

621
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:33,940
Is there a question?

622
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:42,316
- We wanted to say something.

623
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:49,381
At the forum last time
when you talked,

624
00:32:49,382 --> 00:32:50,596
we found it really patronizing.

625
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:51,554
- Be sure you get this.

626
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:52,928
- We felt like you talked

627
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,166
about the students of color
like we weren't even here,

628
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,956
and then you talked
about the white students

629
00:32:56,957 --> 00:32:58,715
like they were all a bunch
of criminals.

630
00:32:58,716 --> 00:33:00,345
- You must have misunderstood.

631
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:02,518
- But how can we misunderstand?

632
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,796
There's a bunch
of white people

633
00:33:03,797 --> 00:33:05,650
onstage

634
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:06,770
literally talking down to us.

635
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:07,888
Young lady, I want to--

636
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,871
I want to hear what you have
to say, but...

637
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:10,861
- Here we go.

638
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:12,203
- I can understand
your feelings.

639
00:33:12,204 --> 00:33:13,611
We're all brothers
and sisters here.

640
00:33:13,612 --> 00:33:14,730
- Here we go where?

641
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,232
- I-I would like to begin.
I had a story.

642
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:17,639
- Hey, man.
You're not our brothers.

643
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,588
- You people don't know
what you're talking about.

644
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:22,242
When I say "brother,"
I mean "brother."

645
00:33:22,243 --> 00:33:24,574
I was a freedom rider.
I marched on Selma.

646
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:25,758
- Ancient history.

647
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:27,388
- Yeah, you weren't at the back
of the line.

648
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:28,666
- You weren't there.

649
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,488
I sacrificed for you people.

650
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:32,246
- Burton.
Enough.

651
00:33:32,247 --> 00:33:34,900
Let him talk.

652
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:37,873
- What are you talking about?
Sit down.

653
00:33:39,024 --> 00:33:41,548
- Please, can we all
just sit down?

654
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:43,945
- But you're always telling us,
"be inclusive."

655
00:33:43,946 --> 00:33:45,735
- It's sheer tokenism, Jay.

656
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:48,070
- You only want us here
so you can put our pictures

657
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:49,475
on your fucking website!

658
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:51,203
That's right.

659
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:53,856
- All you care about
is your image.

660
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:56,540
- Shut up!

661
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:58,043
- Listen.

662
00:33:58,044 --> 00:33:59,161
Listen! Listen!

663
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,280
I got this scholarship.

664
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:02,230
It was supposed
to go to a minority student,

665
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:04,532
but then I'm not
an official minority

666
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:07,409
because there's no box
on the form for what I am.

667
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,286
So to get the scholarship,
I had to say I was Puerto Rican.

668
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:12,939
But I've never even been
to Puerto Rico.

669
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,218
- Excuse me!
Excuse me!

670
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,560
What are you complaining about?

671
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:17,477
I don't even get a scholarship
because I'm white.

672
00:34:17,478 --> 00:34:19,427
- I didn't get it for my color.

673
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:21,634
- That's what you just said!

674
00:34:21,634 --> 00:34:23,488
- <i>I</i> deserved
that scholarship.

675
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:25,565
- <i>I</i> don't get shit
for being white.

676
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:26,940
I'm living in freshmen dorms

677
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,666
'cause there's not
enough housing

678
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,839
because of those
dumbass affinity houses.

679
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,694
- We like those affinity houses

680
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,005
because they get us away
from you.

681
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:36,018
- Come on.
Half of 'em are empty!

682
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:37,808
- 'Cause we don't want
to be ghetto-ized.

683
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:38,832
- Why not?

684
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:42,060
It's where you belong.

685
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:43,754
- Fuck you.

686
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:44,777
- Fuck you!

687
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:47,397
- Oh, don't.

688
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:51,905
- This is not
what we marched for.

689
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,504
- Give us some help here.

690
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:58,713
- Security.
Find security.

691
00:35:01,304 --> 00:35:03,158
Turn that camera off.

692
00:35:04,213 --> 00:35:05,907
You! Turn that off!

693
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:07,440
Turn it off!

694
00:35:13,324 --> 00:35:14,952
- So what's the purpose
of these forums

695
00:35:14,953 --> 00:35:16,583
that you're holding?

696
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:19,811
- Well, we believe
the forums offer

697
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:22,752
a valuable learning experience

698
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,438
and also a chance to heal.

699
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:27,578
- But there was little
in the way of healing

700
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:30,072
at this afternoon's forum.

701
00:35:30,073 --> 00:35:32,023
- You! Turn that off!

702
00:35:32,024 --> 00:35:33,493
Turn it off!

703
00:35:33,494 --> 00:35:35,218
- Some students blame
remarks made

704
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:38,958
by the faculty at today's forum
for the violence that ensued.

705
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:41,835
Belmont's press office reported
that five students were treated

706
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:43,625
for minor injuries.

707
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:46,056
This is Aaron Carmichael
reporting live

708
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:47,429
from Belmont College.

709
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,389
- Sarah.

710
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,923
Would you excuse us?

711
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:22,655
- Can I buy you a drink?

712
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,021
- I'm not giving you
an interview.

713
00:36:25,022 --> 00:36:26,395
- I'm off the clock.

714
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:32,214
I've only been here two months,

715
00:36:32,215 --> 00:36:34,930
and I could really use
the company.

716
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:42,346
- Only if we go someplace
where there aren't any students.

717
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:56,636
Oh, man.

718
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:59,033
We're gonna get killed.

719
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:01,239
- Oh, I can handle myself.

720
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,772
I'm from Newark.

721
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:18,565
- What can I get ya?

722
00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:23,232
What a letdown.

723
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:25,086
- Uh...
- I'll have a beer.

724
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:26,524
Two beers.
- Two beers.

725
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:27,770
- Okay.

726
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:30,680
- So how did you end up...
- In Burlington?

727
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:33,268
- See.
See, I knew that was coming.

728
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:37,616
Um...
I was at WKOW in Portland,

729
00:37:37,617 --> 00:37:40,717
then KCTV Kansas City
doing features,

730
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:42,635
trying to get
behind the anchors' desk.

731
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:45,447
But every station
had black anchors already.

732
00:37:45,448 --> 00:37:47,302
Then this producer
in Burlington called,

733
00:37:47,303 --> 00:37:49,634
and I thought, "hmm."

734
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:52,288
- There are no blacks
in Vermont.

735
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:54,910
- I want East Coast exposure.

736
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:56,764
I want to move
to a major network.

737
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:59,449
- And a story like this
is ready-made?

738
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,517
- It wasn't my idea
to cover this.

739
00:38:02,518 --> 00:38:03,764
I learned a long time ago

740
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:07,855
that my subjects better not be
too black too often.

741
00:38:07,856 --> 00:38:09,390
- So why are you doing it?

742
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:14,441
I didn't really decide to
until I got on campus.

743
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:17,669
It seemed that everybody
was working so hard

744
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,609
to get me off campus
that I had to wonder,

745
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,167
who exactly are they trying
to protect?

746
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:25,116
- Simon.

747
00:38:25,117 --> 00:38:27,451
- Well, you are maybe.

748
00:38:27,452 --> 00:38:29,048
I don't know about the rest
of them.

749
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:34,515
Do--I can't take this music.
- Oh.

750
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:37,392
Do you got some coins
for the jukebox?

751
00:38:37,393 --> 00:38:38,351
- # higher #

752
00:38:39,758 --> 00:38:42,570
# 'cause your love, love, love #

753
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:45,351
# it takes me higher #

754
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:48,995
- Air supply?
- Please.

755
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:53,885
- How do you know
you're a good reporter?

756
00:38:53,886 --> 00:38:55,389
- I am a good reporter.

757
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,394
- But how do you know
if you don't get hired

758
00:38:58,395 --> 00:38:59,927
because you're black,

759
00:38:59,928 --> 00:39:02,389
or if you do get hired
because you're black?

760
00:39:04,053 --> 00:39:06,161
- Didn't Lancaster hire you
because you're white?

761
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:08,430
- They needed
a last-minute replacement.

762
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,732
- Oh, I thought it was
because of some quota.

763
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:12,202
- It was because I was cheap.

764
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:15,079
You're not siding
with that little twerp

765
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,294
at the forum,
are you,

766
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:20,354
Mr. Reverse Discrimination
Anti-Affirmative Action?

767
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:25,117
- It's just the other student,
the one with the scholarship.

768
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:27,002
- Okay.

769
00:39:27,003 --> 00:39:28,186
Here we go.

770
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:32,436
- You want to dance?

771
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:37,008
So he changed "New York"
to "Puerto" and got $12,000.

772
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:38,319
What's the problem?

773
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,493
- People should be called
what they want to be called.

774
00:39:40,494 --> 00:39:42,666
- Yeah, but how are you
supposed to keep up?

775
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,392
- That's not the point.

776
00:39:44,393 --> 00:39:46,310
When--when I was at Lancaster,

777
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:50,273
even though it was my job
to help the students,

778
00:39:50,274 --> 00:39:54,556
sometimes,
because I was white,

779
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:58,713
people took my advice
as paternalistic.

780
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:01,877
- Like you were
the missionary lady

781
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:03,187
coming to clean up the natives.

782
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:06,481
- Well,
something like that.

783
00:40:06,482 --> 00:40:09,836
- Or the kindly slave owner
come to help out these darkies.

784
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:11,308
- Just...
- Okay.

785
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,329
- Quit it!

786
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:22,207
So with Patrick,
I thought...

787
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,965
I will treat him entirely
as an equal.

788
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,458
We will be in
on this whole thing together,

789
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:29,111
exploit the system,
put it to the man.

790
00:40:29,112 --> 00:40:30,902
- Yeah, but you're the man.

791
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:32,277
- He wasn't in on anything.

792
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:33,939
I was just--

793
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,191
I was just a crazy Dean
forcing him to be Puerto Rican.

794
00:40:38,192 --> 00:40:40,173
- Well, did you make him wear
a sombrero?

795
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:41,995
- That's Mexican.

796
00:40:44,072 --> 00:40:46,501
- You know, I don't even know
why you want to help these kids.

797
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:48,835
They seem like a bunch
of ingrates to me.

798
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:50,657
- Because the world isn't fair.

799
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:54,812
People keep getting their asses
handed to them.

800
00:40:54,813 --> 00:40:57,145
Why shouldn't we try
and change that?

801
00:40:58,745 --> 00:41:01,461
Ah.

802
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:05,042
You're an idealist.

803
00:41:05,043 --> 00:41:08,622
Shut up, idealist,
and dance.

804
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:41,738
- You still want
to go to the game tomorrow?

805
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:42,697
- Oh, yeah.
I'd love to.

806
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:44,135
- All right.

807
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:47,748
Get him.

808
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:55,132
Oh!

809
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:56,634
- Son of a bitch.

810
00:42:56,635 --> 00:42:57,720
- Oh, ho-ho.

811
00:42:59,928 --> 00:43:00,886
- What?

812
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:01,845
Uh...

813
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:04,051
Oh, my God.

814
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:13,799
- Thanks for the beer.

815
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,448
You're sending me on my way.

816
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,348
- Tonight was pretty much
the best time

817
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:26,011
that I've had in Vermont.

818
00:43:26,012 --> 00:43:29,686
- It's been so long since
I've had an actual conversation.

819
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:32,116
- I was starting to feel crazy.

820
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:33,747
But tomorrow's gonna be
a horrible day,

821
00:43:33,748 --> 00:43:34,992
and I have to get some sleep.

822
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:39,915
- If you don't like it here,

823
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:40,938
why did you come?

824
00:43:40,939 --> 00:43:43,241
- What, are you
investigating me now?

825
00:43:44,647 --> 00:43:45,862
- You don't fit in here.

826
00:43:45,863 --> 00:43:47,651
The--these people are...

827
00:43:47,652 --> 00:43:48,771
blowholes.

828
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:57,306
I believe the expression
is "blowhards."

829
00:44:00,406 --> 00:44:01,396
- What are you doing here?

830
00:44:01,397 --> 00:44:03,059
- Well, what are you
doing here?

831
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,145
- What, are you saying

832
00:44:04,146 --> 00:44:05,552
that I couldn't cut it
anywhere else?

833
00:44:05,553 --> 00:44:07,246
- Are you saying I sold out?

834
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:08,684
- You ought
to hide those buttons

835
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:09,707
so they don't get pushed.

836
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,082
- You ought
to hide those chains

837
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,360
so they don't get yanked.

838
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,026
- I'm not--
I didn't--

839
00:44:17,027 --> 00:44:20,544
- Yeah, before you choke
on that foot...

840
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:23,293
you want to have lunch tomorrow?

841
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,216
- Oh, hey.
What's up, b?

842
00:44:42,217 --> 00:44:43,782
- aight.
- All right, Del.

843
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:48,194
- For the career day coming up,

844
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:51,103
I have some ideas for people
that I would like to invite.

845
00:44:51,104 --> 00:44:52,733
Practically speaking, I'm--

846
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,236
- I told you, man.

847
00:44:54,237 --> 00:44:56,793
- So, I would like to pursue--

848
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,135
- Hey, man,
you disturbing class.

849
00:44:58,136 --> 00:44:59,862
- Sit down, man.
- pursue any ideas that...

850
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,979
that you all might have.

851
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,195
- Come on, nigger, sit down.

852
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:04,369
- Take your seats, please.

853
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,264
Hey, guys.

854
00:45:15,973 --> 00:45:17,698
- Will President Garvey
make a statement?

855
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:18,753
- No comment.

856
00:45:18,754 --> 00:45:20,385
- Will President Garvey
make a statement?

857
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:21,598
- No comment.
Please. Please.

858
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,262
He'll have a statement
later this morning.

859
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:25,114
- Does the board
have any official position?

860
00:45:25,115 --> 00:45:26,649
- I believe
I've already answered that.

861
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:27,959
- Are you still holding
classes?

862
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,982
- Of course.

863
00:45:28,983 --> 00:45:30,421
- Over here.
One more question.

864
00:45:30,422 --> 00:45:31,763
- Please. Please.

865
00:45:31,764 --> 00:45:32,946
If everybody could just wait,

866
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,640
I'll be handing out
a press release shortly.

867
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:37,293
- Will President Garvey resign?
- No, he won't.

868
00:45:37,294 --> 00:45:39,020
- Are the minority students
going on strike?

869
00:45:39,021 --> 00:45:40,138
- Not to my knowledge.

870
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:42,184
- Will President Garvey
be making a statement?

871
00:45:42,184 --> 00:45:43,463
- Please. Please.

872
00:45:46,884 --> 00:45:48,418
Sarah.

873
00:45:50,496 --> 00:45:51,869
Those are the names and numbers

874
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,322
of some of our key
African-American alumni.

875
00:45:55,323 --> 00:45:57,879
President Garvey wants you
to call them

876
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,268
and assure them that everything
is under control.

877
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:02,610
- Why me?

878
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:04,880
I mean...

879
00:46:04,881 --> 00:46:07,212
Burton said this thing
to me the other day

880
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:10,730
about my being the liaison
to the minority students.

881
00:46:10,731 --> 00:46:13,861
- Well, when we set out
to diversify,

882
00:46:13,862 --> 00:46:16,931
we wanted your experience
serving a...

883
00:46:16,932 --> 00:46:19,519
more diverse student population.

884
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,341
- It wasn't diverse.

885
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:24,251
- African-American then.

886
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:32,146
- Why didn't you hire
a black person?

887
00:46:32,147 --> 00:46:33,138
- We tried.

888
00:46:35,952 --> 00:46:38,572
- So when I came here
for my interview,

889
00:46:38,573 --> 00:46:40,010
were you surprised?

890
00:46:41,322 --> 00:46:42,312
- Surprised?

891
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:44,390
- Because I was white?

892
00:46:44,391 --> 00:46:45,667
- No.

893
00:46:45,668 --> 00:46:48,034
- You didn't think
that because I was at Lancaster,

894
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:49,247
I was black.

895
00:46:49,248 --> 00:46:53,116
- By the time we hired you,
we knew you were white,

896
00:46:53,117 --> 00:46:55,065
so don't let it bother you.

897
00:47:11,977 --> 00:47:15,173
You deserved that scholarship,
and you know it.

898
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:17,794
- Then why does it have to come
at a price?

899
00:47:17,795 --> 00:47:20,127
Why is there is always
some fucking price?

900
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:23,420
Look.

901
00:47:23,421 --> 00:47:25,498
Here's why I agreed
to come and talk to you.

902
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:26,840
I'm applying
at NYU for the spring.

903
00:47:26,841 --> 00:47:27,831
I'm not staying here.

904
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:30,005
- Patrick.
- I hate this place.

905
00:47:30,006 --> 00:47:32,786
You could give me $12,000,
and I don't care.

906
00:47:32,787 --> 00:47:34,064
It's not worth it.

907
00:47:34,065 --> 00:47:35,407
My father says
if I stay here,

908
00:47:35,408 --> 00:47:36,397
all I'll learn is shame.

909
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:37,677
- That's not all you'll learn.

910
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:38,668
- I hate Vermont.

911
00:47:38,669 --> 00:47:40,137
- Please.
Please reconsider.

912
00:47:40,138 --> 00:47:41,128
You're so smart.

913
00:47:41,129 --> 00:47:42,247
- I don't want to reconsider,

914
00:47:42,248 --> 00:47:44,453
and I don't want
anymore compliments!

915
00:47:44,454 --> 00:47:46,627
I'm not some genius
or something.

916
00:47:46,628 --> 00:47:48,161
I'm just whatever I am,

917
00:47:48,162 --> 00:47:50,239
and I want to get the fuck out
of here!

918
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:51,454
- Patrick.

919
00:48:14,693 --> 00:48:16,387
- You're early.

920
00:48:16,388 --> 00:48:18,113
- Do you want to take a walk?

921
00:48:19,776 --> 00:48:21,598
- Well, I don't think
it's entirely your fault.

922
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,802
- It's not enough
to say my intentions were good.

923
00:48:23,803 --> 00:48:25,400
I made the kid feel like shit.

924
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:27,447
- So?
Learn from your mistakes.

925
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:28,726
Make up for it
with the next one.

926
00:48:28,727 --> 00:48:30,994
- That's what I was trying
to do with Patrick.

927
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:34,288
- Yeah,
what were you making up for?

928
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:35,757
- There was no money
at Lancaster.

929
00:48:35,758 --> 00:48:38,570
I couldn't do anything
for anybody there.

930
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:39,658
- Is that why you left?

931
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:40,777
- I left to come here.

932
00:48:40,778 --> 00:48:41,992
- Because...

933
00:48:43,366 --> 00:48:44,388
See, see, see.

934
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:47,138
I just keep getting
this look away.

935
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:49,056
Look, is there something
with the college

936
00:48:49,057 --> 00:48:51,422
that you're not
coming clean about?

937
00:48:51,423 --> 00:48:53,372
Because I already know
that they basically went out

938
00:48:53,373 --> 00:48:55,289
and trolled for black students.

939
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:56,759
- It's called recruiting.

940
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,221
They're trying to diversify.

941
00:48:59,222 --> 00:49:01,235
- Which you're all for, right?

942
00:49:03,634 --> 00:49:05,295
- It's...

943
00:49:05,295 --> 00:49:09,353
It's just...

944
00:49:09,354 --> 00:49:12,039
it's just that the college
treats these kids

945
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,542
like they're action figures,
you know,

946
00:49:13,543 --> 00:49:15,428
like you can collect
the whole set,

947
00:49:15,429 --> 00:49:17,410
but then if you want
to play with them,

948
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,103
you have to take them out
of their packaging.

949
00:49:19,104 --> 00:49:22,077
And once you do that,
they're no good anymore.

950
00:49:23,996 --> 00:49:25,050
- Look.

951
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:26,743
If you think
the world isn't fair

952
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:28,630
and you want to change that,

953
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:31,538
shouldn't you be
at Lancaster?

954
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:35,438
Shouldn't your try and help
the kids who actually need it?

955
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,964
- You don't understand.

956
00:49:37,965 --> 00:49:39,978
Something happened to me.

957
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:44,421
- At Lancaster?

958
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:46,595
What happened to you there?

959
00:49:53,627 --> 00:49:54,585
- I can't.

960
00:49:54,586 --> 00:49:55,833
- Sarah.

961
00:49:58,103 --> 00:49:59,188
Sarah!

962
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:04,719
As police continue
to search for the guilty party,

963
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,221
many students
at Belmont are worried

964
00:50:06,222 --> 00:50:09,033
about the racial climate
at their school.

965
00:50:09,034 --> 00:50:10,665
- White people talk to you
in class.

966
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:13,637
Socially, there's not a lot
of interaction.

967
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:15,460
- Well, it seems like
the students of color want

968
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:16,546
to stay separate.

969
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:18,241
I mean, they have
their own student union,

970
00:50:18,242 --> 00:50:20,445
their own radio shows.

971
00:50:20,446 --> 00:50:22,045
- And some students wonder

972
00:50:22,046 --> 00:50:25,144
if Belmont College's attempts
to bridge the racial divide

973
00:50:25,145 --> 00:50:28,309
are actually making
matters worse.

974
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:32,305
Aaron Carmichael, in Belmont,
for Channel 6 news.

975
00:50:36,845 --> 00:50:40,137
- Hey, the fat lady
has not sung yet.

976
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,982
Let's go to the Fox Hat.
Come on.

977
00:50:42,983 --> 00:50:44,868
- I...

978
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:48,351
I got to finish this paper
while I can still see.

979
00:50:48,352 --> 00:50:50,047
- I'll do a shot
in your honor, dude.

980
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,581
- All right.

981
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:55,000
Whoo-hoo!

982
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:13,829
- Fuck. Fuck.

983
00:51:15,908 --> 00:51:18,335
- Hey, you!

984
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:19,294
What are you doing here?

985
00:51:19,295 --> 00:51:20,574
- Yeah,
what about the note, huh?

986
00:51:20,575 --> 00:51:21,661
Did you find that too,

987
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,002
or did you put it
on Simon's door?

988
00:51:23,003 --> 00:51:24,474
- I just found it.

989
00:51:24,475 --> 00:51:27,415
I swear to you I would
never do anything like that.

990
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:28,532
I swear to God!

991
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:31,665
- Jason. Jason.

992
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:34,159
- Back the fuck off, man.
He didn't do it.

993
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,149
- He didn't do anything.

994
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,460
He was out with us.

995
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:37,835
- Where is Simon?

996
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,813
We're gonna move you
in here with Nathan.

997
00:51:59,732 --> 00:52:02,769
- They're winning.

998
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,156
- Belmont College.

999
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:09,001
Nestled in the mountains
of northern Vermont,

1000
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:11,208
It's the kind
of small liberal arts school

1001
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:13,541
most parents would feel
perfectly safe

1002
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:14,980
sending their children to...

1003
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,481
until now.

1004
00:52:16,482 --> 00:52:19,295
That's when a series
of ugly racial taunts

1005
00:52:19,296 --> 00:52:21,308
against
an African-American student

1006
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:24,568
turned into what some
are calling a death threat.

1007
00:52:24,569 --> 00:52:27,190
It's this sinister message,

1008
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:30,034
intended for the unidentified
Belmont student,

1009
00:52:30,035 --> 00:52:32,721
that has led
to the heightened concern

1010
00:52:32,722 --> 00:52:35,534
and heightened security.

1011
00:52:35,535 --> 00:52:38,251
Apparently, the same student
received similar threats

1012
00:52:38,252 --> 00:52:40,137
in the last two weeks,

1013
00:52:40,138 --> 00:52:42,246
threats
that some say were mishandled

1014
00:52:42,247 --> 00:52:44,483
by the school administration.

1015
00:52:44,484 --> 00:52:46,017
Are you with me?

1016
00:52:46,018 --> 00:52:47,328
Are you sick of this?

1017
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:48,672
Are you tired
of an Administration

1018
00:52:48,673 --> 00:52:49,789
that does nothing?

1019
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,867
If President Garvey
can't provide

1020
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,178
some sort of leadership,

1021
00:52:53,179 --> 00:52:55,799
then he should step aside
for somebody who can.

1022
00:52:59,828 --> 00:53:02,927
- Belmont's Board of Trustees
held an emergency meeting

1023
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:05,358
to discuss how to deal
with the problem,

1024
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,448
although the school
has made no public statement.

1025
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:11,750
In the meantime,
minority students

1026
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:14,371
are taking time off
from the college,

1027
00:53:14,372 --> 00:53:18,015
and many of them are leaving
for good.

1028
00:53:20,126 --> 00:53:22,140
- The Board is livid.

1029
00:53:22,141 --> 00:53:23,833
They want
the students protected,

1030
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:25,496
and they want solutions.

1031
00:53:25,497 --> 00:53:27,414
So here's what I need you to do.

1032
00:53:27,415 --> 00:53:30,003
Come up with a ten-point plan.

1033
00:53:30,004 --> 00:53:31,377
- A plan for what?

1034
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:34,254
- Call it "racial harmony."

1035
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:36,204
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

1036
00:53:36,205 --> 00:53:39,785
And type it up
so any idiot can understand it.

1037
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:43,109
Type it up in a bulleted list.

1038
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:46,752
- You want me to solve racism
with a bulleted list?

1039
00:53:46,753 --> 00:53:50,109
- Include
specific concrete suggestions.

1040
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:17,727
- You know,
I've got an exclusive

1041
00:54:17,728 --> 00:54:19,262
with the kids
in the Black Student Union.

1042
00:54:19,263 --> 00:54:21,339
I thought you might like
to listen in.

1043
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,769
- Well, I can't.

1044
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,560
- Well, don't you care
what they have to say?

1045
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,253
- Of course I do,
but I'm busy.

1046
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:38,090
That's not why I'm here.

1047
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:42,182
I want to know
why you ran away the other day.

1048
00:54:42,183 --> 00:54:43,844
Do you not trust me?

1049
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:47,872
- You're a reporter.

1050
00:54:47,873 --> 00:54:49,181
- But you're not my story.

1051
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:51,131
- Well, what am I then?

1052
00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:52,667
- A friend.

1053
00:54:55,735 --> 00:54:57,652
Maybe something more.

1054
00:54:57,653 --> 00:54:58,867
I don't know.

1055
00:55:01,362 --> 00:55:03,470
Or maybe you don't date
black men.

1056
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:06,283
- That's not it,
and you know it.

1057
00:55:06,284 --> 00:55:07,819
- Yeah?
Well, how do I know it?

1058
00:55:10,216 --> 00:55:11,973
- You know, I was
wondering if maybe the reason

1059
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:13,060
you thought you could treat

1060
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:14,627
the Patrick Chibas kid
as an equal

1061
00:55:14,628 --> 00:55:17,408
is because he's
a nice, creamy latte color

1062
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:19,837
instead of just plain old black.

1063
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:22,426
- That's ridiculous.

1064
00:55:22,427 --> 00:55:25,080
- You know, maybe you did look
down on those kids at Lancaster.

1065
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:27,572
- I did not look down on them.

1066
00:55:27,573 --> 00:55:29,715
- Maybe that's why you left.
- No.

1067
00:55:29,716 --> 00:55:31,312
- Was it the money?

1068
00:55:31,313 --> 00:55:33,390
The skiing?
- I don't ski.

1069
00:55:33,391 --> 00:55:34,574
- The scenery?

1070
00:55:34,575 --> 00:55:35,979
- Why not?
It's beautiful.

1071
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,034
- It's empty.

1072
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:38,506
- There's no crime.

1073
00:55:38,507 --> 00:55:39,943
- Except hate crimes.

1074
00:55:39,944 --> 00:55:43,811
- The leaves, the snow,
the fresh air.

1075
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:45,281
- It's a gated community.

1076
00:55:45,282 --> 00:55:47,041
- It's a winter wonderland.

1077
00:55:47,042 --> 00:55:48,830
- It's fucking White Christmas.

1078
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,761
It's white.

1079
00:55:53,913 --> 00:55:54,968
- You said it.

1080
00:55:57,749 --> 00:55:59,730
- And you're not denying it.

1081
00:56:02,672 --> 00:56:04,844
So you wanted
to be with white people.

1082
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:10,152
- I wasn't always like this,
okay.

1083
00:56:10,153 --> 00:56:12,325
You have to believe me.
I wasn't always like this.

1084
00:56:15,554 --> 00:56:17,728
- Then what changed?

1085
00:56:17,729 --> 00:56:20,541
- I used to be a good person.

1086
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:23,321
- What changed?

1087
00:56:26,997 --> 00:56:28,914
- I met the students.

1088
00:56:28,915 --> 00:56:31,153
- At Lancaster.

1089
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,965
- It wasn't like I'd never been
around black people before.

1090
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:38,249
- But...

1091
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,743
- But I'd only ever known
people--

1092
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:43,555
people like you.

1093
00:56:43,556 --> 00:56:45,538
- Nice, clean, black folks.

1094
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:46,911
- These kids were different.

1095
00:56:46,912 --> 00:56:48,478
- How?

1096
00:56:48,479 --> 00:56:52,282
- They were more...

1097
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,816
regular.

1098
00:56:55,129 --> 00:56:56,821
And they scared the shit
out of me.

1099
00:56:59,859 --> 00:57:01,552
Maybe it was
because I was outnumbered,

1100
00:57:01,553 --> 00:57:04,557
but they all seemed so loud
and belligerent.

1101
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:06,474
And I couldn't understand
a word they were saying.

1102
00:57:06,475 --> 00:57:08,041
They would walk down the hall
in packs

1103
00:57:08,042 --> 00:57:09,479
and if I didn't get out
of their way,

1104
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,741
they'd ram me over
and pushed me aside.

1105
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:14,434
- Hey, hey.

1106
00:57:14,435 --> 00:57:15,458
- They were kids.

1107
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:16,799
- Yeah,
that's what I told myself.

1108
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,174
"They're just kids.
Kids are kids,"

1109
00:57:18,175 --> 00:57:21,562
And that worked
for about a minute.

1110
00:57:21,562 --> 00:57:23,832
But then I just got pissed off
because they were so rude.

1111
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:25,366
- All of them?

1112
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:26,934
- No, there were plenty
of nice ones,

1113
00:57:26,935 --> 00:57:28,467
but they aren't
the ones you notice.

1114
00:57:28,468 --> 00:57:29,747
You notice the awful ones

1115
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:33,517
because they dominate
the landscape.

1116
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:34,701
And it was the same
on the train.

1117
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:36,906
There would be
a dozen black people

1118
00:57:36,907 --> 00:57:39,016
sitting quietly,
going about their business,

1119
00:57:39,017 --> 00:57:42,436
but there'd be
two incredibly loud,

1120
00:57:42,437 --> 00:57:46,080
stinky, offensive black guys
at one end of the car,

1121
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:48,733
and they'd be
the ones I noticed.

1122
00:57:48,734 --> 00:57:50,491
And I told myself not
to pay attention to them,

1123
00:57:50,492 --> 00:57:53,721
that they weren't representative
of their entire race.

1124
00:57:53,722 --> 00:57:55,350
I knew that.

1125
00:57:55,351 --> 00:57:57,044
But then I noticed
that I started slipping

1126
00:57:57,045 --> 00:57:58,898
into a pattern
when I got on the train.

1127
00:57:58,899 --> 00:58:01,552
First--first I would look
for an empty seat

1128
00:58:01,553 --> 00:58:03,949
next to a white woman
and then a white man

1129
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:07,115
and then a black woman
and then...

1130
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,511
Last choice, a black man.

1131
00:58:09,512 --> 00:58:11,109
And sometimes,
if the only empty seats

1132
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:12,068
were next to black men

1133
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:14,050
and if they were wearing
big puffy coats,

1134
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:15,680
then I would just stand.

1135
00:58:15,681 --> 00:58:17,663
And then I started
adding categories:

1136
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:20,892
white men,
then hispanic, then Asian,

1137
00:58:20,893 --> 00:58:22,425
then Middle Eastern

1138
00:58:22,426 --> 00:58:26,390
and then finally
and always last,

1139
00:58:26,391 --> 00:58:29,298
black men.

1140
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:31,024
- Thanks.

1141
00:58:31,025 --> 00:58:33,677
- Well, I felt terrible
about it

1142
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,723
at first.

1143
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:38,120
I'd--I'd get on the train,
and--and I'd wonder,

1144
00:58:38,121 --> 00:58:40,038
"what must
that poor black man be thinking?

1145
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:43,299
"I'm so obviously avoiding him.

1146
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,536
"he's a perfectly nice person
sitting there.

1147
00:58:45,537 --> 00:58:48,350
I can see his face."

1148
00:58:48,351 --> 00:58:52,409
But I just...

1149
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,167
didn't want to take a chance.

1150
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:55,765
And then after a while,

1151
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:59,601
it sort of slipped my mind
to feel bad about it,

1152
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:01,009
and then everything
slipped my mind

1153
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,798
so that when I found myself

1154
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,227
sitting across from my students
thinking that they were scary

1155
00:59:05,228 --> 00:59:09,159
or that their hair was stupid

1156
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,173
or it was no wonder
they were pregnant,

1157
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:13,380
I knew it was wrong,
but...

1158
00:59:13,381 --> 00:59:16,415
I didn't care.

1159
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:19,100
I just felt tired,

1160
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:22,233
contemptuous.

1161
00:59:22,234 --> 00:59:23,799
They weren't gonna listen to me.

1162
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,909
They weren't gonna graduate
from college.

1163
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:28,147
They weren't gonna do anything
with their lives,

1164
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:30,512
not because they couldn't,
but because they didn't want to,

1165
00:59:30,513 --> 00:59:33,645
because they were lazy
and stupid...

1166
00:59:36,779 --> 00:59:39,047
because they were black.

1167
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,363
And it started to scare me.

1168
00:59:50,363 --> 00:59:51,706
For the career day coming up,

1169
00:59:51,707 --> 00:59:55,446
I have some ideas for people
that I would like to invite.

1170
00:59:55,447 --> 00:59:56,852
And then I think--

1171
00:59:56,853 --> 00:59:58,482
I think that we should

1172
00:59:58,483 --> 01:00:00,592
make some--
- Crazy, man.

1173
01:00:00,593 --> 01:00:01,966
- make some room...
- Give it.

1174
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:04,652
- for employers
who are actually recruiting.

1175
01:00:04,653 --> 01:00:06,410
Hey, could you guys--
- Yo. Yo, man.

1176
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:08,072
Do you want
to take your seats, please?

1177
01:00:08,073 --> 01:00:09,637
- Come on, nigger, sit down.

1178
01:00:09,638 --> 01:00:10,853
- Ass in the seat, Nigger.

1179
01:00:10,854 --> 01:00:12,707
- Chill out, girl.
- Hey, could you guys--

1180
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,401
Do you want--
- Naw, man, naw.

1181
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,031
- Nigger!
- Could you guys--

1182
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:17,054
- Nigger, stop playing.

1183
01:00:17,055 --> 01:00:18,717
- Stop it!

1184
01:00:18,718 --> 01:00:19,867
I mean, Jesus Christ,

1185
01:00:19,868 --> 01:00:21,657
if you keep calling
yourself niggers

1186
01:00:21,658 --> 01:00:23,096
and acting like niggers,

1187
01:00:23,097 --> 01:00:26,772
then why do you get so upset
when we think you're niggers?

1188
01:00:30,129 --> 01:00:31,663
- You said that to them?

1189
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:35,563
- This close.

1190
01:00:36,907 --> 01:00:38,088
It was leaving my mouth.

1191
01:00:38,089 --> 01:00:40,102
I could see it in the air.

1192
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,595
- Well, it's not
my favorite word either.

1193
01:00:42,596 --> 01:00:43,682
- But I can't say that.

1194
01:00:43,683 --> 01:00:45,280
- No.
No, no. No, no.

1195
01:00:45,281 --> 01:00:46,463
- I knew
that if I didn't leave

1196
01:00:46,464 --> 01:00:48,670
that that crap would start
coming out of my mouth,

1197
01:00:48,671 --> 01:00:52,632
that everything
that popped into my head,

1198
01:00:52,633 --> 01:00:54,966
that I would say it.

1199
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:58,130
Belmont, Vermont.

1200
01:01:02,447 --> 01:01:04,299
Beautiful mountain.

1201
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,794
Green mountain.

1202
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,451
I knew it would be quiet
and clean...

1203
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:13,921
and white.

1204
01:01:15,936 --> 01:01:18,748
It wasn't a noble way
to save myself, or a brave way,

1205
01:01:18,749 --> 01:01:21,560
but it was the only way
I could think of.

1206
01:01:25,174 --> 01:01:27,763
But now I'm right back
where I started.

1207
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:29,809
- But you're not a dog.

1208
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,247
- Of course I'm not.

1209
01:01:31,248 --> 01:01:33,931
- So you can control this crap,

1210
01:01:33,932 --> 01:01:35,849
but, you know,
you act like you can't,

1211
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:37,896
like a dog can't help chewing up
the furniture.

1212
01:01:37,897 --> 01:01:39,048
But you're not a dog.

1213
01:01:39,049 --> 01:01:41,124
You're a human
with a human-sized brain.

1214
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:43,235
- Well, what about you?
You're not perfect.

1215
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,303
"Put a sombrero on him."

1216
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,682
- We could do this all day.

1217
01:01:50,683 --> 01:01:53,815
You know,
just get it all out.

1218
01:01:55,862 --> 01:01:56,757
Come on.

1219
01:01:59,857 --> 01:02:01,071
Yeah?

1220
01:02:02,862 --> 01:02:04,747
"Blacks:

1221
01:02:04,748 --> 01:02:06,440
"Lazy.

1222
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:08,839
"Stupid.

1223
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,862
Scary hair."

1224
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:13,666
- They're always late.

1225
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:16,543
- Come on. Come on.

1226
01:02:16,544 --> 01:02:18,365
- Homeless.

1227
01:02:18,366 --> 01:02:19,739
They never use crosswalks.

1228
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,529
They're always running out
into traffic.

1229
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,927
- Well, it's no wonder
they're all dead or in prison.

1230
01:02:25,046 --> 01:02:26,004
- Okay.

1231
01:02:26,005 --> 01:02:28,753
Now...

1232
01:02:28,753 --> 01:02:30,991
"Whites:

1233
01:02:30,992 --> 01:02:32,046
"Stingy.

1234
01:02:32,047 --> 01:02:33,005
Tight-assed."

1235
01:02:33,006 --> 01:02:34,124
- Spineless.

1236
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,370
- They can know you
for 15 years

1237
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:36,713
and walk right by you
on the street

1238
01:02:36,714 --> 01:02:38,856
without even recognizing you.

1239
01:02:38,857 --> 01:02:40,900
Always stealing our talent
and our music.

1240
01:02:40,901 --> 01:02:42,371
- Plain vanilla candy-asses.

1241
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:44,385
- Can't cook for shit.
No sex drive.

1242
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:45,503
- Frigid.

1243
01:02:45,504 --> 01:02:47,325
- And when they do it,
they do it all wrong.

1244
01:02:47,326 --> 01:02:48,380
- Hey.

1245
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:52,248
- Freak-assed serial killers.

1246
01:02:52,249 --> 01:02:53,943
- Hateful.

1247
01:02:53,943 --> 01:02:55,413
Liars.

1248
01:02:55,414 --> 01:02:57,491
- And they're always asking
black people to tell them

1249
01:02:57,492 --> 01:03:01,167
that it's okay
that they are racist.

1250
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:12,930
But that's just trading insults.

1251
01:03:12,931 --> 01:03:14,400
- Yeah.
What we need is a plan.

1252
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:16,063
- Hell yes,
we need a plan.

1253
01:03:16,064 --> 01:03:17,181
I mean,
what are you gonna do,

1254
01:03:17,182 --> 01:03:19,004
just sit there and wallow in it?

1255
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:21,273
What the hell good is
that going to do you?

1256
01:03:21,274 --> 01:03:22,839
- Well, fine.
What's yours?

1257
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,365
- I'm going to get
to the bottom of this story.

1258
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:26,804
I'm gonna find the truth,

1259
01:03:26,805 --> 01:03:28,722
because I'll bet
whoever's doing this,

1260
01:03:28,723 --> 01:03:30,127
they don't stand out at all.

1261
01:03:30,128 --> 01:03:31,502
But I'm gonna find
the son of a bitch

1262
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:32,813
and put his face on national TV.

1263
01:03:32,814 --> 01:03:35,050
I'm gonna say,
"Here you are, America.

1264
01:03:35,051 --> 01:03:37,224
"Huh?
Remind you of somebody?

1265
01:03:37,225 --> 01:03:38,886
Run away from that."

1266
01:03:38,887 --> 01:03:41,444
- Oh, I already ran away.
It doesn't work.

1267
01:03:41,445 --> 01:03:43,042
- So what's your plan?

1268
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:00,335
- "One: Stop being stupid.

1269
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,861
"Two: Move to Vermont.

1270
01:04:02,862 --> 01:04:05,194
Three: Admit defeat."

1271
01:04:05,195 --> 01:04:07,655
What is this?

1272
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:12,866
- The college wants a plan too,
ten steps to solve racism.

1273
01:04:19,292 --> 01:04:20,442
And they asked you.

1274
01:04:20,443 --> 01:04:22,999
- Apparently,
I put on a good face.

1275
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,986
- Well,
that's half the battle.

1276
01:04:37,585 --> 01:04:38,673
- # it's my turn, my turn #

1277
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:39,953
# let's go, let's go #

1278
01:04:39,954 --> 01:04:41,105
# I put it all on the line #

1279
01:04:41,106 --> 01:04:42,384
# when I'm out on the crime #

1280
01:04:42,385 --> 01:04:43,633
# it's my turn, my turn #

1281
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:44,817
# let's go, let's go #

1282
01:04:44,818 --> 01:04:46,577
# if you really want it,
go and get it #

1283
01:04:46,578 --> 01:04:47,569
# don't let it go #

1284
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:48,529
# it's my turn, my turn #

1285
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:49,681
# let's go, let's go #

1286
01:04:49,682 --> 01:04:50,737
# I put it all on the line #

1287
01:04:50,738 --> 01:04:52,529
# when I'm out on the crime #

1288
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,968
- Hey!

1289
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,433
- # if you want it,
go and get it #

1290
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:57,808
# don't let it go #

1291
01:04:57,809 --> 01:04:59,537
# you can kill 15 cats
in one song #

1292
01:04:59,538 --> 01:05:01,744
# and you wonder why your shows
don't last that long #

1293
01:05:11,345 --> 01:05:12,433
- You can't record this.

1294
01:05:12,434 --> 01:05:14,449
- Yeah,
well, you can't keep it secret.

1295
01:05:19,474 --> 01:05:21,009
- He's back there.

1296
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:23,121
- Did you call the police?

1297
01:05:23,122 --> 01:05:24,497
- No.

1298
01:05:41,554 --> 01:05:43,888
He said it'd be okay
if we called you.

1299
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:51,377
- It was all you?

1300
01:05:52,786 --> 01:05:55,761
- I can see my hands
writing those notes

1301
01:05:55,762 --> 01:05:57,841
and tying that rope.

1302
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:02,224
I knew I would get caught.

1303
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:03,888
I just...

1304
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:05,904
I did it anyway.

1305
01:06:05,905 --> 01:06:07,185
- Why?

1306
01:06:07,186 --> 01:06:10,353
- It's like someone else
was doing it.

1307
01:06:10,354 --> 01:06:12,305
- Well, I wish somebody else
was doing it.

1308
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:14,161
Now they're gonna think
we're all crazy.

1309
01:06:14,162 --> 01:06:15,761
- Oh, they're gonna love this.

1310
01:06:15,762 --> 01:06:17,424
"There's no racism.

1311
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:19,377
They're doing it to themselves."

1312
01:06:19,378 --> 01:06:22,673
The press is gonna be
all over this.

1313
01:06:22,674 --> 01:06:25,809
Do you know that brothers
are being executed for nothing?

1314
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:27,984
For nothing!

1315
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:32,145
It's shit like this
that sets us back every time.

1316
01:06:32,146 --> 01:06:35,632
I can't believe I've got to go
on the air and report this.

1317
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:37,713
This is an embarrassment!

1318
01:06:37,713 --> 01:06:38,737
- It's not about you.

1319
01:06:38,738 --> 01:06:41,361
- Well, it sure
as hell isn't about you.

1320
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:23,153
- What are you gonna do?

1321
01:07:30,578 --> 01:07:32,432
- You?

1322
01:07:52,146 --> 01:07:54,641
- Good luck to you then, Sarah.

1323
01:07:54,642 --> 01:07:56,817
- Good luck to you.

1324
01:08:32,305 --> 01:08:34,224
- Write up a press release.

1325
01:08:34,225 --> 01:08:35,664
Don't say "expelled."

1326
01:08:35,665 --> 01:08:37,552
- I'll say he
voluntarily agreed to leave.

1327
01:08:37,553 --> 01:08:38,865
- Mm-hmm.

1328
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:41,841
And say we've encouraged him
to seek counseling.

1329
01:08:41,842 --> 01:08:43,344
- Say he's deranged.

1330
01:08:43,345 --> 01:08:45,424
- You've never even spoken
to him.

1331
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:48,528
- Highlight the fact
that we are forming a committee

1332
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:51,377
and we're looking forward
to further discussion.

1333
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:53,041
And you fill in the rest.

1334
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:55,057
- I'll get it out this morning.

1335
01:08:57,617 --> 01:09:00,017
- You know, I feel sorry
for Simon.

1336
01:09:00,018 --> 01:09:02,448
I feel like it's going
to take him a long time

1337
01:09:02,449 --> 01:09:03,472
to recover from this.

1338
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,617
- I think
he just wanted attention.

1339
01:09:05,618 --> 01:09:07,761
- None of you know Simon.

1340
01:09:07,762 --> 01:09:09,232
- I do.

1341
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:10,641
He's Little Black Sambo.

1342
01:09:10,642 --> 01:09:12,880
That's how he referred
to himself in the notes.

1343
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:14,705
Remember the story?

1344
01:09:14,705 --> 01:09:17,521
Little Black Sambo
has some beautiful new clothes,

1345
01:09:17,522 --> 01:09:18,992
and he's walking
through the jungle

1346
01:09:18,993 --> 01:09:20,113
showing them off,

1347
01:09:20,113 --> 01:09:21,808
and a tiger jumps out
of the bush

1348
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:22,801
and threatens to eat him.

1349
01:09:22,802 --> 01:09:26,928
So Little Black Sambo
offers his coat

1350
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:30,097
to the tiger
in exchange for his life.

1351
01:09:30,098 --> 01:09:32,368
And then another tiger pops up,
and so on and so on,

1352
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,833
until the tigers have taken
all his clothes.

1353
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:39,024
Little Black Sambo is going home
naked and forlorn

1354
01:09:39,025 --> 01:09:42,032
when he hears a terrible noise
coming from the forest.

1355
01:09:42,033 --> 01:09:44,049
All of the tigers
are wearing his clothes

1356
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,393
And arguing over
which of them

1357
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:47,601
is the grandest tiger of all.

1358
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:49,392
The tigers argued and argued

1359
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,825
until they got so angry,
they started chasing each other

1360
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:52,944
around a tree.

1361
01:09:52,945 --> 01:09:54,577
They began spinning and spinning

1362
01:09:54,578 --> 01:09:56,368
Until they were
just a yellow blur.

1363
01:09:56,369 --> 01:09:57,552
They spun so fast,

1364
01:09:57,553 --> 01:09:59,824
they spun themselves
into butter.

1365
01:09:59,825 --> 01:10:02,704
So Little Black Sambo
got himself a spoon,

1366
01:10:02,705 --> 01:10:05,872
scooped up the butter,
and ate the tigers up,

1367
01:10:05,873 --> 01:10:08,112
which is just what Simon Brick
has done to us,

1368
01:10:08,113 --> 01:10:10,736
gotten us all in a whirl
over nothing.

1369
01:10:10,737 --> 01:10:12,881
- It wasn't over nothing.

1370
01:10:12,882 --> 01:10:14,865
- He's a little fox,
a con man.

1371
01:10:14,866 --> 01:10:17,681
- Imagine him
for half a second.

1372
01:10:17,682 --> 01:10:18,833
- Oh, ho.

1373
01:10:18,834 --> 01:10:20,817
- That isn't why he did it.

1374
01:10:20,818 --> 01:10:22,192
- Why then?

1375
01:10:23,602 --> 01:10:24,624
- I don't know.

1376
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:25,840
- You don't know?

1377
01:10:27,953 --> 01:10:28,848
- Come in.

1378
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:33,105
- I got a call you wanted
to see Simon

1379
01:10:33,106 --> 01:10:34,224
before I drive him home.

1380
01:10:34,225 --> 01:10:35,889
- Yes, we do.
- Oh, please don't.

1381
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,297
- We deserve an opportunity

1382
01:10:37,298 --> 01:10:40,817
to confront the individual
who's put us through all this.

1383
01:10:40,818 --> 01:10:42,448
Bring him in here, Mr. Meyers.

1384
01:11:00,529 --> 01:11:02,320
Well,
don't you have anything

1385
01:11:02,321 --> 01:11:03,792
to say for yourself,
Mr. Brick?

1386
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:05,808
What were you trying
to get out of us?

1387
01:11:08,785 --> 01:11:09,937
- Nigger.

1388
01:11:12,754 --> 01:11:15,601
I was waiting for someone
to call me a nigger.

1389
01:11:18,193 --> 01:11:19,856
- You see, all my life,
my dad told me,

1390
01:11:19,857 --> 01:11:21,457
"be ready.

1391
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:23,344
Be ready for the day.
Be ready."

1392
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:24,752
But no one would do it.

1393
01:11:24,753 --> 01:11:26,961
- Because no one
on this campus thinks that.

1394
01:11:26,962 --> 01:11:28,657
- Yeah.

1395
01:11:28,657 --> 01:11:32,176
Everyone on this campus
is real nice to me.

1396
01:11:32,177 --> 01:11:36,112
I mean, I walk into a room,
and you all smile big smiles.

1397
01:11:36,113 --> 01:11:37,648
And I can see
you're all trying really hard

1398
01:11:37,649 --> 01:11:39,952
to think of something
to say to me,

1399
01:11:39,953 --> 01:11:42,800
going out of your way
to be my friend,

1400
01:11:42,801 --> 01:11:45,137
like my R.A.

1401
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:46,257
He's great.

1402
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:47,856
You know he has dinner
with me every night?

1403
01:11:47,857 --> 01:11:49,905
I can't even walk down
the sidewalk

1404
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:51,376
because every one
of my professors

1405
01:11:51,377 --> 01:11:53,904
has to come up to me
and say hello.

1406
01:11:53,905 --> 01:11:56,145
They walk right past
all their white students,

1407
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,000
but they all say hello to me.

1408
01:11:58,001 --> 01:11:59,505
Yeah, I'm--

1409
01:11:59,506 --> 01:12:02,161
I'm lucky
the way everyone loves me.

1410
01:12:02,162 --> 01:12:03,824
- You are lucky.

1411
01:12:03,825 --> 01:12:06,992
- You think I can't feel
that hate?

1412
01:12:06,993 --> 01:12:09,552
It's so thick
that I can't even breathe!

1413
01:12:09,553 --> 01:12:11,921
Why don't you just say it?

1414
01:12:11,922 --> 01:12:13,201
Say it!

1415
01:12:13,202 --> 01:12:14,352
- Get him out of here.

1416
01:12:14,353 --> 01:12:15,825
- Come on, Simon, let's go.
- Say it!

1417
01:12:15,826 --> 01:12:17,521
- Get him out of here.
Get him off my campus now.

1418
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:22,032
- I hate you too.

1419
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:22,929
- Let's go.

1420
01:12:41,201 --> 01:12:43,216
- And on that note...

1421
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:48,336
- What's this?

1422
01:12:48,337 --> 01:12:50,096
- My letter of resignation.

1423
01:12:50,097 --> 01:12:51,249
I quit.

1424
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,464
- Why?

1425
01:12:52,465 --> 01:12:54,384
- This sends
a terrible message.

1426
01:12:54,385 --> 01:12:55,632
- He's right.

1427
01:12:55,633 --> 01:12:57,712
He's nothing but a problem
to you.

1428
01:12:57,713 --> 01:12:59,152
- Of his own making.

1429
01:12:59,153 --> 01:13:00,624
- You're relieved he's gone.

1430
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:02,704
You'd be relieved
if they all left.

1431
01:13:02,705 --> 01:13:04,785
- That's outrageous.

1432
01:13:04,786 --> 01:13:07,057
- Oh, there's no cameras now.
Just say it.

1433
01:13:07,058 --> 01:13:09,841
"We'd all be so much happier.

1434
01:13:09,842 --> 01:13:14,512
It'd be so much easier
if everybody was white."

1435
01:13:14,513 --> 01:13:17,265
- I have never thought that.
- Fine.

1436
01:13:17,266 --> 01:13:19,408
Stick to your stories
if it makes you feel better,

1437
01:13:19,409 --> 01:13:21,520
but...

1438
01:13:21,521 --> 01:13:24,177
I don't want
to be a liar anymore,

1439
01:13:24,178 --> 01:13:26,672
and I really want
to get the fuck out of here.

1440
01:13:28,978 --> 01:13:30,801
- Where are you going?

1441
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:39,664
- Hey, jared.
Wait up.

1442
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,288
- Oh, thanks.

1443
01:13:42,289 --> 01:13:43,185
- There it is.

1444
01:13:45,169 --> 01:13:48,400
Come here.

1445
01:13:48,401 --> 01:13:50,608
Congratulations.

1446
01:13:50,609 --> 01:13:52,560
Send me a postcard
from the land of the living.

1447
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:55,057
- All right.

1448
01:13:55,058 --> 01:13:56,112
Bye.

1449
01:14:00,049 --> 01:14:02,192
- Dean Daniels.

1450
01:14:02,193 --> 01:14:04,112
Greg Sullivan,
Students for Tolerance.

1451
01:14:04,113 --> 01:14:05,840
- Oh, yeah,
I remember you, Greg.

1452
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:06,800
What's up?

1453
01:14:06,801 --> 01:14:08,816
- Our first meeting was a bust.

1454
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:12,464
Dean Strauss wouldn't shut up.

1455
01:14:12,465 --> 01:14:13,648
- And on top of that,

1456
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,472
there are no black students
in our group.

1457
01:14:15,473 --> 01:14:17,328
- Aha.
- Right.

1458
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:18,480
It's ridiculous.

1459
01:14:18,481 --> 01:14:21,136
But I don't know what to do.

1460
01:14:23,762 --> 01:14:25,392
- Well, maybe I do.

1461
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,121
- Hi, Dean Daniels.

1462
01:14:39,122 --> 01:14:41,616
- Hey,
Claudia, Tyler.

1463
01:14:41,617 --> 01:14:43,312
I've got someone here
I'd like you to meet.

1464
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,768
- I think Aaron's point
that we cover these stories

1465
01:14:46,769 --> 01:14:49,744
more aggressively
is probably true,

1466
01:14:49,745 --> 01:14:53,392
but they also seem un--
unusually common.

1467
01:14:53,393 --> 01:14:56,497
- But it's fair to speculate
on what motivates these people.

1468
01:14:56,498 --> 01:14:58,417
Belmont is implying
that this particular student

1469
01:14:58,418 --> 01:14:59,377
is mentally ill.

1470
01:14:59,378 --> 01:15:00,560
- Well,
of course you have to be

1471
01:15:00,561 --> 01:15:02,161
to do something like this.

1472
01:15:02,162 --> 01:15:03,825
But it happens often enough

1473
01:15:03,826 --> 01:15:05,841
that it makes you wonder

1474
01:15:05,842 --> 01:15:08,752
if there's not
something else too.

1475
01:15:08,753 --> 01:15:10,096
- Something in the air?

1476
01:15:10,097 --> 01:15:11,888
- Well, maybe.

1477
01:15:11,889 --> 01:15:14,000
I mean, this kid wouldn't have
done this to himself

1478
01:15:14,001 --> 01:15:16,368
if somebody hadn't made him
feel bad,

1479
01:15:16,369 --> 01:15:18,640
if somebody hadn't put the words
in his head.

1480
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:21,168
See, I don't think
you see yourself like that,

1481
01:15:21,169 --> 01:15:22,480
the way he did,

1482
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:26,480
unless somebody's already seen
you that way first.

1483
01:15:26,481 --> 01:15:27,536
Let me explain.

1484
01:19:52,145 --> 01:19:53,145
