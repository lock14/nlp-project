1
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,010
<i>I'm Erica Bain. And as you know,</i>
<i>I walk the city.</i>

2
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,280
<i>I bitch and moan about it.</i>
<i>I walk and watch and listen...</i>

3
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,200
<i>... a witness to all</i>
<i>the beauty and ugliness...</i>

4
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,300
<i>... that is disappearing</i>
<i>from our beloved city.</i>

5
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,990
<i>Last week took me to</i>
<i>the gray depths of the East River...</i>

6
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,190
<i>... where Dimitri Panchenko</i>
<i>swims his morning laps...</i>

7
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,230
<i>... like he has every morning</i>
<i>since the 1960s.</i>

8
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,110
<i>Today I walked by the acres of scaffolding</i>
<i>outside what used to be the Plaza Hotel...</i>

9
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,830
<i>... and I thought about Eloise.</i>

10
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,710
<i>Remember Kay Thompson's Eloise?</i>

11
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,660
<i>Eloise who lived in the Plaza Hotel...</i>

12
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,790
<i>... with her dog Weenie and her parents,</i>
<i>who were always away...</i>

13
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,270
<i>... and her English nanny who had</i>
<i>eight hairpins made out of bones.</i>

14
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,700
<i>That Eloise. The adored brat</i>
<i>of my childhood. A little punk kid...</i>

15
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,540
<i>Sid Vicious, spewing beer from his teeth</i>
<i>in the Chelsea Hotel.</i>

16
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,040
<i>Andy Warhol, his sunglasses...</i>

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,870
<i>Edgar Allan Poe, freeing live monkeys</i>
<i>from the crates of a crumbling schooner...</i>

18
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,190
<i>... on the oily slips of South Street.</i>

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,400
<i>Stories of a city...</i>

20
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,920
<i>... that is disappearing before our eyes.</i>
<i>Its people swept over...</i>

21
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,440
<i>So, what will be left of those stories?</i>

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,550
<i>Are we going to have to construct an</i>
<i>imaginary city to house our memories?</i>

23
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,910
<i>Because when you love something,</i>
<i>every time a bit of it goes...</i>

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,020
<i>... you lose a piece of yourself.</i>

25
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,400
<i>So where's Eloise going to sleep tonight?</i>
<i>Can you hear her ghost...</i>

26
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,570
<i>... wandering around the collapsing</i>
<i>corridors of her beloved Plaza...</i>

27
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,860
<i>... trying to find her nanny's room...</i>

28
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,840
<i>... calling out</i>
<i>to the construction workers...</i>

29
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,630
...in a voice that nobody hears:

30
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,620
"Has anyone seen my turtle,
Skipperdee?"

31
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,370
This is Erica Bain, and you've been listening
to <i>Street Walk</i> on WNKW.

32
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,470
- <i>And this is 90. 1, WNKW.</i>
- All right.

33
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,080
- See you next week.
- Have a good one, Erica.

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,130
Hey, I'm out of here.

35
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,500
Did Eloise really mean that much to you?

36
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,450
Oh, come on, Carol.
Weren't you ever a little girl?

37
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,610
Not the kind of little girl that
remembers the name of her turtle.

38
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,540
Anyway, good show.

39
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,710
Look, Bravo called again
about that TV spot.

40
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,600
You know what? I'm...

41
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm not a face. I'm just a voice.

42
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,040
The shows are on the website.
People can download them for free.

43
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,340
- Yeah, exactly.
- Maybe.

44
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,180
Bye.

45
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,220
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

46
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,400
- Hello.
- <i>What are you wearing?</i>

47
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,630
Green scrubs, tied at the waist,
very sexy V-neck.

48
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,090
- <i>Short-sleeved little number.</i>
- How about the sexy green hat?

49
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,530
- Still got that?
- <i>In my hand.</i>

50
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,670
You like it more than the others,
less than the others or the same?

51
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,110
Oh, yeah. I'm at the place...

52
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,610
...and I wanna make sure you're still okay
with the cream and the orange.

53
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,960
Yeah, cream and orange.

54
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,620
Actually, it's not cream.
It's vanilla. But that's fine.

55
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,280
It's not cream. It's vanilla.

56
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,750
- Who cares? Let's go get married tonight.
- <i>Your mother cares.</i>

57
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,050
Trust me, she wants invitations.

58
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,100
Yeah, these are good. Thanks.

59
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,500
Hey, listen. For tonight, if you meet me
at Nicole's art thing...

60
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,550
<i>... you don't have to</i>
<i>talk to anyone but me.</i>

61
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,230
- <i>Maybe.</i>
- Come on.

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,400
- <i>I've got a game, haven't I?</i>
- You're not coming?

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,510
- <i>Look, I've gotta go.</i>
- What?

64
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,110
<i>I do love you.</i>

65
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,580
Yeah. I love you too.

66
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,710
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, you're James.

67
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,820
- I'm Erica. I'm Nicole's friend.
- Hi.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,610
These are good.
They're really cool. I love them.

69
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,420
The Laundromat is in a town in Jersey
where Diane Arbus used to do her laundry.

70
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,590
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, that gun store is down in Chinatown.

71
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,840
Berenice Abbott shot it in the '30s.

72
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,950
It's really evocative, you know?

73
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,410
Kind of quiet. I like that.
It doesn't make too much noise.

74
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,560
Thanks.

75
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,870
Bring more drinks, less shrimp. More.

76
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,530
Where you going? You're leaving?

77
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,920
- No, no. I'm staying. I'm staying.
- Oh, my God, you're such a bad liar.

78
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,130
I know, but I try.

79
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,760
You have to convince him
to come to one of these things.

80
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,200
He can't avoid us forever. Oh, my God.

81
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,700
- What are you doing here?
- Don't you love this woman?

82
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,700
I could take her or leave her.
You guys...

83
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,840
...this, when it starts, it's disgusting.

84
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,470
- We have to go.
- You're too happy.

85
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,620
- Say goodbye.
- Bye.

86
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,840
- I hate you.
- I love you.

87
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,560
I really... I hate you so much.

88
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,440
Oh, God. It's so pretty out.

89
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,200
Tell you what. I'll get him.
You sit here. Okay?

90
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,340
No, let me get him.

91
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,890
- Okay. Will you get me my jacket too?
- Fine.

92
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,400
Here. Take this.

93
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,020
Thanks.

94
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,470
Hey.

95
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,270
Oh, I can open my own door.

96
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,750
Thank you.

97
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,780
Good boy. Good boy.

98
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,370
- Hi, puppy!
- Here.

99
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,950
Are you gonna be that crabby
when you get older?

100
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,730
I am older. And I'm way meaner.

101
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,890
Look, she gave me an apple. Here, baby.

102
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,070
- So she is human.
- That was too big a bite.

103
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,830
That was too big a bite.
I didn't say you could eat the whole thing.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,310
You know what?

105
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,780
I could get about maybe five days and we
could go to the place with the water and...

106
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,390
...find good food and lots of sleeping.

107
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,350
Yes, I concur.

108
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,950
Here, boy. Good boy.

109
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,220
Good boy.

110
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,510
Don't give it to him. Throw it.

111
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,440
- I wasn't mucking about, you know.
- What about?

112
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,060
Why can't we go down
to city hall tonight?

113
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,320
- Because it's closed.
- Tomorrow, then.

114
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,750
David, you have a family.
I don't, you know?

115
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,870
- You're not marrying my family.
- Well, I am, kind of.

116
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,910
I mean, I hope I am.

117
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,380
Your mom is so sweet and she just...
She wants the whole deal, you know?

118
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,110
She wants the invitations...

119
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,680
...and the band playing and the minister.

120
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,840
I don't know. Maybe I do too,
you know? Because...

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,820
...it's not like I'm gonna do this twice.

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,590
You're not?

123
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,060
No, I'm not.

124
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,580
That's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

125
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,350
Where's Curtis?

126
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,270
Oi, Curtis!

127
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,900
Come on, boy.

128
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,950
Come on, pup! Did he go up there?

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,270
- He's not in there, is he?
- Come on!

130
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,350
Curtis?

131
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,480
Hey!

132
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,790
- There he is.
- Curtis.

133
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,700
- Come on, boy.
- Curtis, come on.

134
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,150
Hey, Curtis?

135
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,390
- Hey.
- Curtis.

136
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,360
Hey.

137
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,040
- What's up, boy?
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

138
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,460
Hey.

139
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,950
Man, don't you know
there's a fucking leash law?

140
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,280
Yeah, don't you fucking know better?

141
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,390
Yeah. I'm sorry. Thanks for finding him.

142
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,430
It's... It's all good, bro. It's all good.

143
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,700
But...

144
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,420
...I get a reward or something?

145
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,790
Our gratitude. Now give him to me.

146
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,810
Come on, man. You know gratitude
ain't worth shit around here.

147
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,780
- You're hurting him!
- Give me the dog.

148
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,010
No, I don't think so.
See, I kind of like this dog.

149
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,600
I think he's a keeper. A keeper.

150
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
Smile, baby.

151
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,950
- You are a cunt.
- Fuck you, bitch!

152
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Come on, motherfucker.
That's what I thought, you stupid pussy.

153
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,710
- Look...
- Go.

154
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,270
I haven't got much money.
You can have what I've got.

155
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,500
Give me your watch, give me your
ring. Let's go, I ain't got all day.

156
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,140
Hurry the fuck up, princess.

157
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,820
- Let's go. Hurry up!
- Give him the shit.

158
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,650
- Get the fuck over here.
- Fuck!

159
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,220
- David!
- I fucking missed it!

160
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,590
Where you going?

161
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,070
- Action!
- Think you're fucking with me?!

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,340
You just made my day!

163
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,010
Popped your motherfucking cherry!

164
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,120
Let's even shit out.

165
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,870
Ready for your close-up, cunt?!

166
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,220
Heads up!

167
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,560
Hollywood!

168
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,680
Think you're fucking with me?!

169
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,020
You ain't got nothing to say now, fool!

170
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,710
- David.
- Oh, how cute. Lovebirds.

171
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,960
- A chickenhead and a faggot.
- Say "cheese," bitch!

172
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,810
This is the emergency room.

173
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,660
- Did you get any sleep?
- No. Where's Murrow?

174
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,520
We're looking for him.

175
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,880
She was dead on arrival
and her fingerprints are all over the gun.

176
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,000
- Where?
- Bedroom.

177
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,920
Daughter called 911.

178
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,800
Thanks. I wanna see her.

179
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,820
- So he's laughing again.
- Yeah.

180
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,900
Listen, the kid's in a waiting room
with ACS. I'll meet you over there.

181
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,930
We need your signature right here.

182
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,430
Where is she?

183
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,930
- Can I talk to her?
- You can try.

184
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,880
Hey, sweetie.

185
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,180
Can I have a word with you?

186
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,880
We're just gonna be right here.
All right.

187
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,000
You like lollipops?

188
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,190
Pick one.

189
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,400
That was the one I was gonna pick.

190
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,700
You know, sweetie...

191
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,000
...something you should know. Your
mommy, she was really worried about you.

192
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,830
And if she could, she would tell you
that you can trust me.

193
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,990
Did your stepfather hurt your mommy?

194
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,160
Sean? Sean!

195
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,760
Okay. Okay, step back!

196
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,780
- I want my daughter!
- Get back!

197
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,430
All right! All right.

198
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,150
You don't have the right.

199
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,710
- I do...
- At a time like this, I need to see her.

200
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,860
No, you don't. I do have the right.

201
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,520
- She is my daughter.
- No, she is your stepdaughter.

202
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,590
And you know
how this whole thing works.

203
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,840
You done been through this a thousand
times. You hire your lawyers...

204
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,800
...and you do your thing.
But right now, we're gonna do ours.

205
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,790
- I'm gonna take a walk. You deal with him.
- Yeah, I got it.

206
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,000
That was Dr. Sterling. Okay, bye-bye.

207
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,620
It's a hell of a thing.

208
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,310
- Yup.
- I heard her show once.

209
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,900
Erica?

210
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,320
Erica, can you hear me?

211
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,210
Erica?

212
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,760
You had the service?

213
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,840
They didn't know when
you were going to wake up...

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,510
...if you were going to wake up.

215
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,560
You were gone for three weeks.

216
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,070
We had to let him go. We had to.

217
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,970
I wanna see him again.

218
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,720
- He's gone.
- I wanna see him again!

219
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,130
He's gone, honey.

220
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,940
He would have been happy
that you lived.

221
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,140
<i>Nurse Bench, you have a call on one-four.</i>
<i>Nurse Bench.</i>

222
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,690
I don't know. All the faces
are starting to blur together. l...

223
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,550
I just can't tell anymore, you know?

224
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,280
You gotta help us here. We need
something from you, anything.

225
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,000
Let's start over again.

226
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,960
He hit your boyfriend with the pipe.
Once, twice, three times?

227
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,600
We know how tough it can be...

228
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,470
...to go back there...
- Do you, huh?

229
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,630
Look, Miss Bain, we're on your side.

230
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,440
Yeah.

231
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,480
I know that.

232
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,590
You're the good guys.

233
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,590
So how come it doesn't feel like that?

234
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,510
<i>Please leave a message for David and Erica</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

235
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,310
<i>Hey, it's me. Call me at the gallery.</i>

236
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,780
<i>I'll take you out. Go to dinner, a movie.</i>

237
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,000
<i>Let's go for a walk. Anything, okay?</i>

238
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,760
Ma'am, can I help you?

239
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,200
Detective O'Connor and Detective Pitney,
please.

240
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,110
Pitney and O'Connor are out.
Can anyone else help you?

241
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,320
Well...

242
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,720
...you know,
I wanted to check on my case.

243
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,410
I've been calling and
we've been playing phone tag...

244
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,750
...and I thought that if I came down...
- Okay.

245
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,850
What kind of case did you have?

246
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
My boyfriend was beaten to death.

247
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,900
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have a complaint report number?

248
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,950
- No, I don't know it.
- And what was his name?

249
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,820
David Kirmani.

250
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,320
K-l-R-M-A-N-I.

251
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,550
It might be under Erica Bain.

252
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,280
About how long ago did it happen?

253
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,880
June 11 th.

254
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,190
Okay. I realize how difficult
this can be...

255
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,140
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

256
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,640
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

257
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,300
Okay.

258
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,630
I realize how difficult it can be...

259
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,580
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

260
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,590
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

261
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,390
- Wanna get something to eat?
- What's up, guys?

262
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,190
- Hey.
- You saw the game last night?

263
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,880
Man.

264
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,740
Could I help you?

265
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,060
Yeah. I wanna buy a gun.

266
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,650
License?

267
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,830
Oh, yeah, of course.
I need a license, yeah.

268
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,250
Once you get one, fill out this form,
and we'll notify you in 30 days.

269
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,990
I need to get something now.

270
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,950
Sorry. That's illegal.

271
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,280
Hey!

272
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,490
I won't survive 30 days.

273
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,300
Hey.

274
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,400
- What happened to you?
- Me? Nothing.

275
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,350
A thousand dollars.

276
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,950
A thousand dollars?

277
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,280
Okay, but I need to learn how to use it.

278
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,320
No shit. Follow me.

279
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,670
Wait right here.

280
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,890
In here.

281
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,690
It's a Kahr K9.
Check to see if it's loaded.

282
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,030
How do I do that?

283
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,050
The chamber. Pull the slide back.

284
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,800
It's got internal safety so you don't
shoot yourself. Loads from the handle.

285
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,880
All right.

286
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,260
You pay me now, it's yours.

287
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,210
I'll throw in the bullets.

288
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,680
Yeah, I'll take it.

289
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,580
Got it, got it, got it.

290
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,000
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.

291
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,340
I don't care.

292
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,820
There's plenty of ways to die.

293
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,780
But you have to figure out a way to live.

294
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,530
Now, that's hard.

295
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,690
Look at you, all sophisticated.

296
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,980
- You shouldn't be working this late.
- I had a client dinner.

297
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,420
Hey, can I get a dirty martini
for the lady?

298
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,790
You said this was business, Sean.

299
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,030
It is.

300
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,690
Eighty-six that.

301
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,190
Okay, l...
I need a favor from you.

302
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,170
You...

303
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,850
- You heard about that Murrow thing, right?
- His wife killed herself.

304
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,010
Oh, come on. Women don't
shoot themselves in the face.

305
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,730
At least in my experience.

306
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,470
Where do they shoot themselves,
in your experience?

307
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,340
The heart.

308
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,270
Jackie, I been...

309
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,300
...chasing after this asshole
for three straight years.

310
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,920
And right when his wife was ready
to turn state's evidence on him...

311
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,750
...instead of blowing the lid off of him,
she blows off her own head.

312
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,190
- Come on.
- You don't let go, do you?

313
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,070
So what can I do?

314
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,620
Well, she has a daughter.
Had a daughter.

315
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,150
And...

316
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,460
...her daughter knows something.

317
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,720
But now he's asked for custody of her
and then he's gonna get it.

318
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,250
- Is he the father?
- No, no. He's her stepfather.

319
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,510
- And you want her made a ward of court.
- Yes.

320
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,830
She knows something
and she's not safe with him.

321
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,820
Look, all I'm asking you to do
is just act on her behalf.

322
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,450
Please.

323
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,540
Sean, I'm your ex-wife.

324
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,780
Conflict of interest.

325
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,850
And besides, I don't do pro bono.

326
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,960
You used to.

327
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,950
Yeah, well, I grew up.

328
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,250
When did you get out?!

329
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,840
- You won't let me see my kids?
- You can't be here! Court order!

330
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,730
- I'm calling 911!
- lf I can't see them, you won't see them!

331
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,760
Try seeing them now.

332
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,470
It's my money too.

333
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,450
I can hear you breathing.

334
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,870
No.

335
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,800
- Squad central.
- <i>Notify upon arrival.</i>

336
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,450
- Damn.
- We're a 10-84 at 110 and Lenox.

337
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,380
<i>10-4. Eighty-five to patrol supervisor</i>
<i>on the scene.</i>

338
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,850
- 10-4.
- Looks like the circus made it to town.

339
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,480
Any IDs?

340
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,260
Victim's a 30-year-old Vietnamese female.
Ida Combs.

341
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,490
- Where's the other body?
- This way.

342
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,800
Got a 39-year-old, Sandy Combs.
White male.

343
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,930
Looks like he was a roadie for Aerosmith.
I don't think those guys have a dental plan.

344
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,140
Guy had a rap sheet longer than my dick.

345
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,860
So in other words, no priors.

346
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,940
Easy.

347
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:48,690
So we got us a Sandy Combs and
an Ida Combs. What does that tell us?

348
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,820
They're married.
I'm way ahead of you, pal.

349
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,510
- Yeah, that's one way of ending it.
- You know, what's wrong with divorce?

350
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,590
Everything.

351
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,240
Divorce sucks.

352
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,100
Okay, so tell me.

353
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,720
Well, she took three in the torso
with a.38.

354
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,810
Then somebody smoked him with a 9 mm
automatic. Don't ask me who, though.

355
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,880
And we found these casings.

356
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,350
Three casings. Looks like there's
a partial print on one, but it's smudged.

357
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,190
Anybody check surveillance?

358
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,030
That monitor's working,
but the machine's empty.

359
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,290
Machine's working.

360
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,460
- But where's the tape?
- Don't know.

361
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,070
And why didn't he take the money?

362
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,640
They chickened out, got scared?

363
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,240
We got three casings, only one hit.
How about that?

364
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,570
Maybe he's farsighted, crappy shooter.
Who knows?

365
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,140
Or he never fired a gun before.

366
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,500
<i>It is...</i>

367
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,870
<i>... astonishing...</i>

368
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,940
<i>... numbing, to find...</i>

369
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,680

00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,550

<i>... your eyes.</i>

374
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,940
<i>A sleepless, restless stranger...</i>

375
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,520
<i>... who keeps walking...</i>

<i>... keeps...</i>

378
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,560
<i>... living.</i>

379
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,060
New York, like any metropolis...

380
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,130
New York, like any metropolis,
is an organism that changes, mutates.

381
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,470
Building sprout-like chromosomes
on the DNA of its streets.

382
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,050
<i>New York, like any metropolis...</i>

383
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,900
<i>... is an organism that changes, mutates.</i>

384
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,090
<i>Building sprout-like chromosomes</i>
<i>on the DNA of its streets.</i>

385
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,500
Look, I've got... I've got two shows
that are almost finished.

386
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,570
They're already mixed. All they need is an
intro and an outro, which I could do live.

387
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,560
I've got six shows in various stages.

388
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,700
I've got all these stories in my files.
You know, new stuff, better stuff.

389
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,320
And I know what I'm doing,
and you know that I know what I'm doing.

390
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,330
Erica. You've been through so much.

391
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,830
You need more time before
you put yourself out there.

392
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,230
- Don't make me beg.
- I don't mean to.

393
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,330
But we have a public and I'm not sure
you're ready for it yet.

394
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,830
You telling me I can't work
because of what happened?

395
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,230
I did not say that.

396
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,000
Look...

397
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,910
...I just need to keep living.

398
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,350
You know, I don't wanna...

399
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,320
I don't wanna disappear.

400
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:12,220
- <i>station WNKW,</i>
<i>located at 90. 1 on the FM dial.</i>

401
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,450
<i>Up next is</i> Street Walk.

402
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,680
Let's now join Erica Bain
in our WNKW studios.

403
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,080
Okay, Erica.
Three, two, one, you're on.

404
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,060
This is Erica Bain, and I walk the city.

405
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,840
New York...

406
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,230
...like any metropolis, is an organism...

407
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,280
Okay. Is there anything we can cut to?

408
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,100
<i>Music, prerecord, anything?</i>

409
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,990
Give me a minute, Carol.

410
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,910
New York...

411
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,590
...like any metropolis...

412
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,790
...is...

413
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,430
Oh, shit.

414
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,640
New York...

415
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,900
...the safest big city in the world.

416
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,690
But it is horrible...

417
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,800
...to fear the place you once loved.

418
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,600
And to see a street corner
you knew so well...

419
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,480
...and be afraid of its shadow.

420
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,340
To see familiar steps,
be unable to climb them.

421
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,500
I never understood
how people lived with fear.

422
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,220
Women afraid to walk home alone...

423
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,520
...people afraid of...

424
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,690
...white powder in their mailbox...

425
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,250
...darkness and night.

426
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,060
<i>People afraid of people.</i>

427
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,760
I always believed that fear
belonged to other people.

428
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,160
Weaker people.

429
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,470
It never touched me.

430
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,160
And then it did.

431
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,050
And when it touches you, you know...

432
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,970
...that it's been there all along...

433
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,640
...waiting beneath the surfaces
of everything you loved.

434
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,880
And your skin crawls...

435
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,600
...and your heart sickens...

436
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:48,410
...and you look at the person you once were
walking down that street...

437
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,110
...and you wonder, will you...?

438
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,390
Will you ever be her again?

439
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,810
Talk to me.

440
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,340
Look at this motherfucker right here.

441
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,340
Hey, what sounds
you got up in there, dog?

442
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,870
This motherfucker
think I'm playing, man.

443
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,300
Don't nobody talk in New York no more?
I asked you a motherfucking question!

444
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,890
I said, what are you listening to,
you fucking faggot?!

445
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,590
- Radiohead, man.
- Radiohead?

446
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,450
Leave him alone, man!

447
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,340
Man, shut the fuck up!

448
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,680
Little man, you ain't know
your pop sucked dick?

449
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,140
He's good at it too. Now, you wanna
grow up to be like that punk ass?

450
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,060
That's a nice watch.
How old are you?

451
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,940
- Get your ass out of here.
- Tell your mom I said "What's up?"

452
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,810
Yo, little man, holler at me,
I'll show you how to be a G.

453
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,630
Hey, yo, thanks for the iPod, man.

454
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:49,240
This shit is nice, man.
This is all me right here.

455
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,710
- I'm keeping this joint.
- You kidding me, right?

456
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,570
This is cool.

457
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,820
Oh, shit.

458
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,810
- Yo, yo, yo, I got this, I got this.
- Bitch, is you crazy?

459
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,020
This is too easy, man.

460
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,060
So...

461
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,300
...you gonna give me some Radiohead
too?

462
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,000
You ever been fucked by a knife?

463
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,380
<i>I should have walked out of that train.</i>

464
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:23,480
<i>I could've just shown them the gun,</i>
<i>and they wouldn't have hurt me.</i>

465
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,720
<i>Why don't my hands shake?</i>

466
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,970
<i>Why doesn't somebody stop me?</i>

467
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,400
I swear they like Oreos.

468
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,930
Homicide, this is Vitale.

469
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,430
There you go,
you're doing the tricks again.

470
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:50,010
Upside down. No, come on up.
Gotta come to the top. There you go, baby.

471
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,870
Okay, thank you.

472
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,620
We've got two confirmed shot
on a subway from Brooklyn.

473
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,950
Church Street, lower Manhattan.
Everyone's arguing whose jurisdiction.

474
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,360
- That makes it ours.
- All right, fellas, let's go.

475
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,760
We got two dead bodies inside
the subway car, and no eyewitnesses.

476
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,970
Of course not.
Did you check with BCI?

477
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,310
Yeah, I got this printout.

478
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,910
- They here yet?
- Yes, sir.

479
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,390
- And I'll get them to you.
- Morning, fellas.

480
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,110
Christ on a cracker.

481
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:02,270
Well, I hope this is their stop.

482
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,740
Got Radiohead, U2, Dixie Chicks.

483
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,630
- No Wu-Tang?
- I don't think this is his.

484
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,890
Money in his pocket.

485
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,360
Looks like a 9 mm automatic.

486
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,310
- Like from the other night?
- Yeah.

487
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:38,620
Check it against Brass Catchers,
see if it matches.

488
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,180
Hey, you.

489
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,000
- just go inside. I came out here for
a smoke. I just wanna go back in.

490
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,730
You're giving me a hard time.
You let my friends in.

491
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,360
They both had cash, so neither one of them
was robbed. And they had priors.

492
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,430
A shitload of them.

493
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,670
The guy at Sandy's, he had priors.

494
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,530
I know, but that was domestic.

495
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,000
No, but he wasn't robbed.

496
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,340
Or something.

497
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:35,550
- I mean, what are we missing?
- I wish I knew.

498
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:39,200
Now, look. You got a small guy sitting.

499
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,990
These two punks come at him with a knife
and, you know...

500
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,740
...he shoots the first one without
getting out of his seat.

501
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,360
Right. Go on, I'm with you.

502
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:50,280
It's like maybe Mr. Average Joe just
decided, "I'm not gonna take it anymore.

503
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,650
And I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands."

504
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,820
The kind of guy
you wouldn't even notice.

505
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,670
Well, if that's true, he's getting better.

506
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,610
Yeah. Every bullet hit home.

507
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,390
- Detective!
- Hey, detective!

508
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,040
- Detective!
- Any leads, detective? Please.

509
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,320
- Come on, step back!
- What about the bodies, detective?

510
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,920
It's a new... It's a new investigation.

511
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,990
We haven't talked to anybody yet, no.

512
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,330
It's a brand-new investigation.

513
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:30,880
- Any suspects?
- No, we're not... I'm sorry, but we're not...

514
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,030
Any leads? How many?

515
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,710
Detective!

516
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,770
Hey.

517
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,850
Excuse me, don't I know you?

518
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,540
- No, I don't think we've met.
- Wait a minute. I know you.

519
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,520
- No. You haven't. l...
- What's your name?

520
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,240
My name's Erica Bain.
I do a radio show.

521
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:50,690
I don't know if you'd be interested in doing
an interview. I'd love to...

522
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:52,950
I'm sorry.
We're not talking to the media now.

523
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,550
I'm not that kind of media.
It would be about you.

524
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,280
My life's not that interesting.

525
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,410
- Yeah, but the work you do is.
- No, thank you.

526
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,260
<i>So...</i>

527
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,560
<i>... you gonna give me some Radiohead</i>
<i>too?</i>

528
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,660
<i>You ever been fucked by a knife?</i>

529
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,730
How the hell did this get out so quick?

530
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,200
Who knows? Coroner hates you,
people fucking technicians. Who knows?

531
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,830
"Bloodbath."

532
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,200
You ever listen to NKW?

533
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,860
- What is that, like hip-hop?
- No.

534
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,860
Remember a couple of months ago...

535
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:00,860
...this girl and her boyfriend,
they got jacked in Central Park?

536
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:04,860
- No. Which ones?
- Well, anyway, she has this radio show.

537
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,810
- Right.
- She shows up at the subway last night...

538
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,280
...and guess who she wants to interview?
- Me?

539
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,150
What, you? You should totally do it.
Remember that Bernie Goetz thing?

540
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,290
Hey, is Carter in?

541
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,080
Reporters calling in the night.
Reporters eat that shit up.

542
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,660
No, well, she's not that kind of reporter.
Yeah, well, have him call me.

543
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,460
What is she?
Like a DJ or something?

544
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:27,000
- No, she's just interesting, you know.
- Interesting?

545
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,990
Have him call me at my desk.
It's Mercer.

546
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,130
What's she want with you?
Give her my number.

547
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,730
What's her precise street address?

548
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,240
You know what I want?

549
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,480
I want everyone in the market
that night...

550
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,280
...everyone on the subway, outside.
Everybody, I need them all brought in.

551
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,690
Somebody has to have seen this guy.

552
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,160
I need you to get the registration
off of this iPod.

553
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,710
- See who it belongs to.
- I'm on it.

554
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,260
You've been avoiding me.

555
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,870
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah.

556
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:00,330
You've been avoiding
the full glare of my disapproval.

557
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:04,800
Yeah, well, it was... The show sucked
and everybody hated it. I'm sorry.

558
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:08,210
Well, we don't normally do silence
on WNKW.

559
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:10,400
You almost managed a full minute.

560
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,680
Well, I think I did
an okay recovery, so...

561
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:17,150
You got 11 more steps, do you?
Are they all gonna be on the air?

562
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:25,090
I thought we were better than
some AM confessional...

563
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,670
...but people are responding.

564
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:31,710
I was wrong.
I'm big enough to admit it, so keep it up.

565
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,790
Erica Bain?

566
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,050
Erica Bain.

567
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,220
I'm Detective Mercer. You...

568
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:06,600
You remember me from last night?

569
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:10,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well...

570
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,830
...I saw you in the hospital after...

571
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,080
After what had happened
to you and to your friend.

572
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,160
My friend?

573
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:25,010
Yeah. I stopped by your room, you know,
because I recognized your name.

574
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:29,150
My wife, she used to listen to your show
all the time and...

575
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:33,160
...that was why I stopped you
in the subway.

576
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,910
I just wanted you to know that.

577
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,850
Thank you.

578
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,250
You know, it was disturbing.

579
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,250
It really was. I mean, you were gone.

580
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:53,310
And to see somebody...

581
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,030
...that can't see you, it...

582
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,440
But you're back now.

583
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,830
Yeah, I'm back now.

584
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,330
A lot of people don't make it back.

585
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,180
I know that.

586
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:11,370
I know you do. You see...

587
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,330
...I checked into your case.

588
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,650
- You checked into my case?
- Yeah.

589
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:20,390
We got two of the best detectives
in this city that's working on this...

590
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,660
...and we will find them.

591
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,140
We always do.

592
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,000
Are policemen always so confident?

593
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,560
Are you interviewing me now?

594
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,980
- Yeah, I guess I am.
- Right.

595
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,930
Okay.

596
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,310
How long is this gonna take?

597
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:45,060
Five minutes, tops.
We can do it over here.

598
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:48,840
Yeah.

599
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:54,560
When you first go to a crime scene...

600
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,970
...what do you look for?
- Evidence.

601
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,180
Okay, such as?

602
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,230
Murder weapon, entry wound...

603
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,890
...DNA samples, prints,
carbon fragments...

604
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,780
...position of the corpse.

605
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,730
It's amazing what a dead body
can tell you.

606
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,840
So the dead do talk?

607
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,310
Oh, yeah. Everybody talks.

608
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:19,660
Now, most everybody lies.
But the dead can't.

609
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:23,910
And then again, the lies
tell you things too, because...

610
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:26,450
...people tell them for a reason.

611
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:30,920
And those bodies at the subway,
what are they telling you?

612
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,290
You read the paper.

613
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,430
Should I believe what I read?

614
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,790
You ever read about him?

615
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,670
Why do I know him?

616
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:50,100
That's Mr. Murrow. He owns the parking
out on Roosevelt Island.

617
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,100
But that's not all he does.

618
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,010
What else does he do?

619
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:00,650
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

620
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,320
Then this is off the record.

621
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,840
Okay.

622
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,320
He imports drugs, guns, people.
Whatever's in demand.

623
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,350
Found three guys that had crossed him...

624
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:19,630
...with their hands Superglued to a table
and expanding cement in their throats.

625
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,770
Had his wife ready
to testify against him...

626
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,900
...and then she's found with her brains
blown out, gun in her hand.

627
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,110
Nothing adds up except his lawyers.

628
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,220
Now he's got custody
of his stepdaughter...

629
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:31,630
...and not for sentimental reasons.

630
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,120
But he knows she knows something...

631
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:37,010
...and I hate to think what's
gonna happen to her. But...

632
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,010
...maybe you know a nicer side.

633
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,410
And why can't you nail him?

634
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,320
Because I follow the law.

635
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:51,840
Well, there's nothing you can do?

636
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,090
Nothing that's legal.

637
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,640
I didn't say that.

638
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,840
I didn't hear it.

639
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:06,970
Thank you.

640
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,160
<i>Nothing that's legal.</i>

641
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:13,890
So...

642
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,430
...there's nothing you can do?

643
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,370
No. No matter how bad I feel about it.

644
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:24,080
I petitioned that she be made
a ward of the court...

645
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,070
...but his lawyers killed that one
stone dead, so...

646
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,010
Ever shot anyone?

647
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,850
Yeah.

648
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,790
Did your hands shake?

649
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,950
No.

650
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:47,310
But that's one of the benefits
of being on the right side.

651
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:52,980
A benefit that that asshole and
the subway shooter don't have.

652
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,240
And you think they're the same?

653
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:59,440
They both walked away from a murder,
didn't they?

654
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,220
Let me ask you a question.

655
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,930
Just us.

656
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,120
How did you...

657
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,630
...pull it back together
after what happened to you?

658
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,280
You don't.

659
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,640
I'm sorry.

660
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,300
- No, no.
- Jacked-up question, man.

661
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:25,960
It's a fair question. You...

662
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,220
You become someone else.

663
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,530
A stranger.

664
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,630
You must have loved him very much.

665
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,200
Yeah.

666
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:55,500
Sometimes that just makes it harder,
you know. You just wish you didn't.

667
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:00,110
So, come on, some more cop stuff.

668
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:03,090
- Or are we done?
- No, l... We're good.

669
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:06,160
Thanks.

670
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:09,380
And... here.

671
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,530
That's my card. You...

672
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,270
You wanna talk about your case,
you can call me. Any time.

673
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,000
I warn you...

674
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,530
...I don't sleep.

675
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,440
Neither do I.

676
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,370
<i>I walk the streets at night now.</i>

677
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,670
<i>I find places and things</i>
<i>I never knew existed.</i>

678
01:00:55,990 --> 01:01:00,360
<i>But am I finding them</i>
<i>or are they finding me?</i>

679
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,200
<i>Ever shot anyone?</i>

680
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:08,040
<i>Yes.</i>

681
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,450
<i>Did your hands shake?</i>

682
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:18,000
<i>No, that's one of the benefits</i>
<i>of being on the right side.</i>

683
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:22,960
<i>That from a police detective covering</i>
<i>last night's subway shooting.</i>

684
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,920
<i>And like all good cops,</i>
<i>he believes in the law...</i>

685
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:31,540
<i>... in right and wrong,</i>
<i>and the thin, fragile line between them.</i>

686
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:36,530
<i>And he's probably wondering,</i>
<i>as I speak...</i>

687
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,760
<i>... why is somebody</i>
<i>doing his job for him?</i>

688
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,780
Hey, baby.

689
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,290
- Hello.
- What's up, honey?

690
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:59,920
Not much.

691
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:03,350
So, what would 50 dollars do for you?

692
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,660
- Shouldn't she be at home?
- She got no home.

693
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:10,730
Have you, honey?

694
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,490
- Where to?
- Come on in.

695
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,250
- You're looking for a show in the back seat?
- Oh, yeah.

696
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,350
What's your name, honey?

697
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:33,710
Chloe.

698
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:37,710
What's he got in mind, Chloe?

699
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:41,070
The little whore needs a mommy.

700
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:44,080
Are you a mommy?

701
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:47,530
You're a whore, right?

702
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,620
I'm collecting whores.

703
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,790
You know them suicide bombers
over in Iraq?

704
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,780
When they die they want 72 virgins.
Me, I want whores.

705
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:56,670
I want them while I'm alive.

706
01:02:56,830 --> 01:03:00,430
You know, Chloe and I
are gonna take a little walk.

707
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:07,630
- You ain't going nowhere.
- Never get in the car.

708
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,480
How long have you been in it?

709
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,850
Four...

710
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,770
...five, six days.

711
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,660
Since...

712
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,960
Since Vegas.

713
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:27,180
But you wanna go now, don't you?

714
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,270
Yes.

715
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:32,240
Are you giving me grief again?

716
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:35,270
Oh, my, got us a supercunt here.

717
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,620
Open the doors.

718
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,440
And if I don't?

719
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:42,460
Then I'll be the last supercunt
you'll ever see.

720
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:46,800
Get out of the car, Chloe. Go on.

721
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:49,210
Not until he pays me.

722
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:51,320
All right, pay the girl.

723
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,650
Come on! Easy.

724
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,970
All of it.

725
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,350
All of it!

726
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,040
Come on, walk.

727
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,680
Don't turn around. Just keep going.

728
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:29,900
You got a family back there, Chloe,
in Vegas?

729
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,070
No. I went there from Albuquerque.

730
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,580
Well, you got enough money
to get you home now.

731
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,230
Ain't you a sad whore?

732
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,700
Get out of the way!

733
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:56,980
Hey. Hey!

734
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,900
You're okay. You're okay, come on.

735
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,120
Let me turn you over.

736
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:05,870
All right. I'm so sorry. Here.

737
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:10,190
Is this...

738
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:11,890
...still America?

739
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,100
Yeah. Your leg is broken.

740
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,740
Who the hell are you?

741
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,270
I'm nobody.

742
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,610
<i>There is no going back...</i>

743
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:33,330
<i>... to that other.</i>

744
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:35,500
<i>She is gone.</i>

745
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:39,320
<i>This thing, this stranger...</i>

746
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,780
<i>... it's all you are now.</i>

747
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:49,840
You walking out the heat?

748
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:51,280
Yeah.

749
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,000
Are you all right?

750
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:56,180
Your hands are cold as ice.

751
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:01,110
Your lipstick is smudged.

752
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,900
Erica. Erica!

753
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,500
You never said my name before.

754
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:14,070
I heard your show.

755
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,390
Right and wrong?

756
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:23,410
Ballistic tests have linked
last night's shooting...

757
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,990
...with the shooting from the market
and the shooting from the subway, so...

758
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,750
Are you saying...? Are you saying the
same gun was used in all three shootings?

759
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:32,430
Well, that seems to be the case.

760
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,910
Detective.

761
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:36,830
Sources are saying the witness
can provide a description...

762
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:39,880
...but has refused to talk.
- I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

763
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:43,080
Has the witness refused
to provide a description?

764
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:46,930
No, the witness is awake...

765
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:50,990
...and she is coherent, and we will be
interviewing her shortly.

766
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,540
Now, thank you, that's everything.
Chief.

767
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:57,690
Please, everybody, please.

768
01:06:57,850 --> 01:07:00,540
That's all the information
we're prepared to release.

769
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,400
Thank you very much.

770
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,200
Hey.

771
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,930
- You handled yourself really well back there.
- I tried.

772
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:18,480
So, what, is this guy
becoming an obsession with you?

773
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,200
No, my interest is in you.

774
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,600
Why me?

775
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:29,170
Well, because you seem like a good man,
you know? Like a good cop.

776
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:33,000
Yeah, well, ain't nobody
doing my job for me.

777
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,730
You heard my show.

778
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,560
Yeah.

779
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:39,380
You gotta think every one of those
reporters in that room...

780
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:42,030
...is gonna sensationalize this.

781
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:43,800
But not you.

782
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,110
You're better than that.

783
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,990
How can you tell?

784
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,360
Your show.

785
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,250
- My show?
- Yeah.

786
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:58,130
You see, my wife...

787
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:00,430
...she didn't listen to it.
- No?

788
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,810
I did.

789
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,490
Well, you don't fit our audience profile.

790
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:09,310
- Yeah, and you don't fit your voice either.
- I don't?

791
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:14,710
No, you're a whole lot cuter
and about 100 pounds lighter.

792
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:19,600
How's the girl doing?

793
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,040
She's pretty banged up.
Yeah, but we'll know more tomorrow.

794
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:28,110
Well...

795
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:31,800
I hope she's all right.

796
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:33,370
Yeah.

797
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,510
- Hi.
- Hey.

798
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,050
You see those pictures
of the subway thing?

799
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,020
- Gross.
- They shot another one last night.

800
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:54,870
- Some pervert.
- Who will they go for next, Donald Trump?

801
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,400
- No, that's incitement.
- And justified.

802
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:00,190
- Wish he'd take care of my ex.
- You think that's funny?

803
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,840
I suppose you think
lethal injection's funny too.

804
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:06,000
- Funny like strange, or funny "ha, ha"?
- You're sick, you know that?

805
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,050
You're all sick.

806
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:18,930
I'm thinking about opening up your show.
I want you to take phone-ins.

807
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,070
- On what?
- You heard them.

808
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,330
You mean the shootings?
The vigilante thing?

809
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:28,570
- You really think that that's appropriate?
- Why not?

810
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:31,630
Well, I thought you said
you didn't like that kind of thing.

811
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,760
I don't. But you're good at it.

812
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:38,450
- How am I good at it?
- You're a survivor.

813
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:41,370
- I'm not asking you to personalize it.
- Oh, you're not?

814
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:43,740
No more than you already have.

815
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:48,120
<i>" The essential American soul is hard...</i>

816
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,090
...isolate, stoic, and a killer.

817
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,450
It has never yet melted."

818
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,790
I quote that from D.H. Lawrence...

819
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,220
...because someone
is playing God out there...

820
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,250
...killing in the name of justice,
in this...

821
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,980
...the safest big city in the world.

822
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:10,810
And because I've been asked today to do
something that we've never done before:

823
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:13,020
Take calls from our listeners
on the subject.

824
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,840
This is a new departure for us but
we wanna hear from you...

825
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,120
...so call 212-165-9990.

826
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,980
First caller. Hi, you're on the air.

827
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,010
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i>he's doing us a favor.</i>

828
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,150
And why is that?

829
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,230
<i>Because no matter what</i>
<i>the media tells us...</i>

830
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,850
<i>... crimes are being committed,</i>
<i>and he's cleaning it up.</i>

831
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,870
And you think
he has the right to do that.

832
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,210
- <i>Well, yeah.</i>
- Next caller. You're on the air.

833
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,390
<i>You're talking about murder.</i>

834
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,270
<i>The death penalty without a trial.</i>

835
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:44,730
<i>The vigilante is just like the people</i>
<i>he's killing. He should be in jail.</i>

836
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:47,640
Well, maybe he will. Next caller.
You're on the air.

837
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,360
<i>It's less about what he's doing</i>
<i>than how it makes us feel.</i>

838
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,870
<i>There's not a person I know...</i>

839
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:54,200
<i>... doesn't get a jolt of</i>
<i>pleasure when they hear</i>...

840
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:56,600
- <i>Pleasure?</i>
- <i>Yeah, revenge makes us feel good.</i>

841
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:58,940
<i>That's why we have war,</i>
<i>why we got the death</i>...

842
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,140
- <i>Next caller, you're on the air.</i>
- <i>I think it's good for New York.</i>

843
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,540
<i>I mean, this city</i>
<i>was turning into Disneyland.</i>

844
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,790
- <i>We're getting our street cred back.</i>
- <i>Next caller. You're on the air.</i>

845
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,960
<i>What is wrong with our society, that this</i>
<i>kind of thing can even get on radio?</i>

846
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,000
<i>Revenge, murder, vigilante killings?</i>

847
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,850
<i>Hasn't the whole Iraqi debacle</i>
<i>taught us anything?</i>

848
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:19,640
<i>"Waste the bad guys, bring them on."</i>

849
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,260
<i>I've been a fan of yours.</i>
<i>I can't even believe you're</i>...

850
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:24,090
Neither can I. You're on the air.

851
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,870
<i>I wonder if the vigilante has a girlfriend</i>
<i>because there's something sexy about</i>...

852
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,720
- Sexy?
- <i>Yeah, completely.</i>

853
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:32,220
<i>And if he's listening, my number is 2</i>...

854
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,930
- You're on the line.
- <i>This is the vigilante calling.</i>

855
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,440
<i>I'm the man that takes care of business.</i>
<i>That chick can have</i>...

856
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,050
- I need to talk to someone.
- Ma'am, can I help you?

857
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,290
Yeah.

858
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,090
I need to talk to someone
about a homicide.

859
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,530
Names?

860
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,950
Erica Bain.

861
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,970
She was the victim?

862
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,800
No. She wasn't the victim.

863
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:10,780
She was the...

864
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:14,720
- She's...
- No "Erica Bain" under homicide.

865
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,420
- Well, maybe there should be. You know?
- Pardon me?

866
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:23,960
Nothing.

867
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:28,470
<i>You gonna give me</i>
<i>some Radiohead too?</i>

868
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,300
<i>Fucking woman!</i>

869
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:34,290
<i>Are you a mommy?</i>
<i>You're a whore, right?</i>

870
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:38,720
Erica?

871
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:42,980
Is that you?

872
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,800
- <i>Because I could not stop for Death...</i>
- Erica?

873
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:49,970
<i>... he kindly stopped for me.</i>

874
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,260
Erica?

875
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,740
<i>The carriage held but just ourselves.</i>
<i>And Immortality.</i>

876
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,510
Erica?

877
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:13,170
<i>Mercer.</i>

878
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,960
Hey, it's me, Erica.

879
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,620
I know.

880
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,690
- Is everything okay?
- <i>Yeah, I...</i>

881
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:27,760
I just wanted to talk and l...
For some reason, I thought of you.

882
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,590
<i>Okay.</i>

883
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:33,200
<i>What's going on?</i>

884
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:36,080
What do you do when you can't sleep?

885
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:41,370
- Nothing.
- <i>Isn't that hard?</i>

886
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:43,550
To do nothing?

887
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:47,190
<i>Well, you sort of get used to it.</i>

888
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,320
Erica?

889
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,120
<i>Well, come on, what's happening?</i>
<i>Talk to me.</i>

890
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,380
Did you sleep better
when your wife was beside you?

891
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,940
I know I did.

892
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:11,930
I couldn't feel my body unless his arms
were wrapped around me.

893
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:15,040
<i>Yeah, well, my wife, she used to...</i>

894
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,690
<i>... flip through the night.</i>

895
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:21,190
So I called her a mackerel.

896
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,550
I guess that's not the worst thing
in the world to wake up to.

897
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:30,810
<i>Hey, you want me to stay on the phone</i>
<i>with you until you go to sleep?</i>

898
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:32,310
No.

899
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:35,290
You've been good to me.

900
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,910
<i>Sleep tight.</i>

901
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,430
Yeah.

902
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:55,460
How late?

903
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,900
Look, I'm not busting your balls. You
told me it'd be there and it better be.

904
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:36,500
Why do you think you can hurt people?

905
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:39,290
- What?
- Just do damage and walk away.

906
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,130
Don't you know what you leave behind?

907
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:44,280
- Do I know you?
- Do you think about it?

908
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:47,860
Does it keep you up at night?

909
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:51,300
- Does it haunt you?
- Excuse me?

910
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,530
Because it haunts me.

911
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:54,940
Are you one of them
press paparazzo freaks?

912
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,080
You got a fucking camera there?

913
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,440
You can't take my fucking picture.

914
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:02,900
You're gonna come to my fucking place
and take my fucking picture?

915
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:06,910
You fuck!

916
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:10,260
- You a fucking cop?
- You wish.

917
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:13,210
Well, it looks like he fell from up there.

918
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:17,470
Cause of death could be the fall.
It could be the crowbar stuck in his skull.

919
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:19,770
I'd say 50-50 either way.

920
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,590
Shit.

921
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:23,650
Maybe 70-30.

922
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,380
I mean, come on, man. How many people
wanted this prick dead? Besides us?

923
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:32,440
Too many.
The problem is he knew all of them.

924
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:34,750
He wouldn't let anybody
get this close to him.

925
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:38,300
You think someone did us a favor?
Maybe we should put him on the payroll.

926
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,020
What, like someone think
they're doing our job for us?

927
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:44,260
Saying, "Hey, New York's finest,
I'm gonna send you a little message.

928
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,470
This is how it's done."

929
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:47,920
- Get a shot right there.
- Officer!

930
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,000
Here we go. All right, I'll be back.

931
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,730
Erica, are you okay? Oh, my God.

932
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:55,030
- Get out.
- My God!

933
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,010
- Get away!
- No, I won't get away.

934
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,810
Don't touch me. I'm sick!

935
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,320
I can see that.

936
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:11,260
- We have to get you to a hospital.
- No.

937
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,600
No.

938
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,610
- Why not?
- I can't because...

939
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,010
Oh, God. I can't.

940
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:22,720
What kind of trouble are you in?

941
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:25,200
You don't wanna know.

942
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:18,420
Were you a nurse?

943
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,740
When I had to be.

944
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:24,830
This is going to leave a scar.

945
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:31,990
I killed a man tonight.

946
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,990
Because he did this to you?

947
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,520
No.

948
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,590
I would've killed him anyway.

949
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:47,810
Back home...

950
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:51,480
...they gave young boys guns.

951
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,750
Made them kill their parents.

952
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,080
Just to show us...

953
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,110
...anyone...

954
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,520
...can cross that line.

955
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:07,750
Anyone can be a killer.

956
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:12,930
Each death leaves a hole...

957
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,540
...waiting to be filled.

958
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:26,210
Did the ME come back
with his liver temperature yet?

959
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:30,050
Yeah, he's about... Dead about two hours
from when we got there.

960
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:35,320
- So that puts us at what time?
- About 1:00, give or take.

961
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,350
Damn.

962
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:42,590
Okay, I want everyone from the subway
and from that market killing...

963
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:45,570
...I want them all brought in again.
- We've done all of that.

964
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:48,450
We need to do it again.
We need to think outside the box.

965
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:51,330
But he hit him with a crowbar,
hefted him over the rail.

966
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:54,810
We're talking about a different guy
here, man. Think about it.

967
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:57,510
Maybe.

968
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:01,310
What about the iPod?
You said it traced back to a kid.

969
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,860
I thought I told you.
The kid's father is an attorney.

970
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:06,040
- He wants a subpoena, but I'm on it.
- Get him.

971
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:09,240
- Whatever you gotta do...
- All right. I'll call right now.

972
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:18,300
Hey, Erica.

973
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,890
No, I just wanna know how you slept.

974
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:24,960
Hey, you wanna see what I do?

975
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:30,340
Well, meet me over at Wynnward Hospital
in Washington Heights.

976
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,440
You'll get an idea.

977
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:37,920
<i>East 14 and Broadway, East 14 and</i>
<i>Broadway. None confirmed at the time.</i>

978
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:45,510
Why doesn't he march here?

979
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:48,520
- March down the street.
- Ethan Grant, my man.

980
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,230
Now sit your hippie ass down.

981
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,110
You smoking pot?

982
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:56,190
- I need to talk to you.
- My dad said not to get involved.

983
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,140
Oh, yeah? Does your dad know
you smoke grass, huh?

984
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,820
That's a lot more than
a misdemeanor these days.

985
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:04,260
- Listen, I didn't see anything.
- I think you did.

986
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:07,870
- Look at me. Hey, you selling this shit?
- No.

987
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,320
Well, I believe you.

988
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:13,190
Maybe a judge won't. Come on, Skippy.
Get your shit. Let's go. Come on.

989
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,240
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Hey.

990
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:23,550
Sure.

991
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,660
- Nice jacket.
- Thanks.

992
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,220
So, what time
you got to sleep last night?

993
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:31,770
I don't know, pretty soon
after we hung up, I guess.

994
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:35,210
- About 1, 1:30?
- Yeah. Something like that.

995
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:38,600
Yeah. I ended up working all night.

996
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,170
You know you're not gonna be able
to reference this on your show?

997
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:45,570
Sure, if I knew what this was.

998
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:48,860
We're gonna interview
a witness to a shooting.

999
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:52,380
- Isn't that against procedure?
- Yeah.

1000
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,370
But I've tried to talk to her twice...

1001
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,910
...and she seemed real nervous
to talk to me.

1002
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,490
I figure maybe if you were there,
she'll talk.

1003
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:01,190
Why me?

1004
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,460
Because you got me to talk.

1005
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,520
Hi, Chloe.

1006
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:19,430
How are we feeling today?

1007
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:21,690
All right.

1008
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,880
I brought a friend.

1009
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:33,150
Hi, Chloe.

1010
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,260
Hi.

1011
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:57,380
So you feel like telling me what happened
to you that night now?

1012
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:15,850
That's a pretty necklace.

1013
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:26,880
You should tell them what you saw.

1014
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,240
Whatever it was, tell them the truth.

1015
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,190
It's okay.

1016
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,810
I saw...

1017
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:51,360
I saw nobody.

1018
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:56,740
Come on, Chloe.
Tell me the truth now, all right?

1019
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,740
And nobody saw me.

1020
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:10,750
Okay.

1021
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:13,130
Sorry if that upset you.

1022
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,640
Well, I'm sorry that
I couldn't be more help back there.

1023
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,610
Well, you definitely seemed to help her.

1024
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:22,910
She sure liked your...

1025
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:24,740
...necklace.

1026
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:26,820
It meant a lot to me.

1027
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,960
Erica?

1028
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:41,280
- Yeah.
- Why'd you call me last night?

1029
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:44,550
I told you, I couldn't sleep.

1030
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,870
And you were in bed?

1031
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,780
No. I couldn't sleep.

1032
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,580
You wanna tell us again
why you didn't wanna come in?

1033
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:07,130
- For what? To get back my iPod?
- Hey, watch your ass.

1034
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:09,890
I don't know. I had mixed feelings.

1035
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,580
I mean, I was kind of glad
those guys got killed.

1036
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:16,230
- You were glad?
- Yeah. I know I shouldn't be, but I was.

1037
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:20,320
- While we're young, give us a statement.
- Look, I didn't see any vigilante.

1038
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,490
Those guys smacked me around
and took my iPod.

1039
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:25,320
Then they hassled some black dude
sitting next to his kid...

1040
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:29,060
...so we all got off,
except for some woman at the back.

1041
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:31,010
A woman.

1042
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:34,480
Yeah, just a woman.
She was staying out of it.

1043
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,650
Maybe the vigi guy got on
at the next stop.

1044
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:41,450
Can you describe this woman well enough
for an artist to make a sketch?

1045
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:42,830
I can try.

1046
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,350
<i>Where are you going</i>
<i>with this woman thing?</i>

1047
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,300
I'm not sure yet.

1048
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:53,450
Women kill their kids, their husbands,
boyfriends, shit they love.

1049
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:55,070
They don't do this.

1050
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,710
- How you doing?
- They don't?

1051
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:58,300
- Good.
- You need some more water?

1052
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:59,900
- Nope.
- Okay.

1053
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:03,040
Just think about the first moment
that you met her. All right?

1054
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:05,490
Where you were, where she was.

1055
01:26:05,650 --> 01:26:07,890
Tell me anything that comes to mind.

1056
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,070
She had light hair, I think.

1057
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:17,190
And okay lips. And she was skinny.

1058
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:22,210
But she had some ass.
You know, you could tell because...

1059
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:26,020
- But you're not doing the ass, right?
- No.

1060
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:27,750
Okay.

1061
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:30,760
She had good skin.

1062
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,730
It was smooth.

1063
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,610
And nice breasts.

1064
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:40,070
Yeah. Like, they were little,
like Kate Moss titties.

1065
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:42,720
- But they looked good with...
- Try to focus on the face.

1066
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:44,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

1067
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:48,550
- Hey, you know what I do remember?
- What?

1068
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,090
She was, like, on lockdown.

1069
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:55,490
<i>I mean, shut off. Kind of scary.</i>

1070
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,270
"It's not cream.

1071
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,520
It's vanilla."

1072
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:01,580
You left a hole in me.

1073
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,530
But I'm done now.

1074
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,030
You hear me?

1075
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:13,960
I'm done now.

1076
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:21,770
Great. It's Jennifer Aniston.
I knew he was bullshitting us.

1077
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:24,680
No, not really. This is a phenomenon
that happens quite often.

1078
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:27,010
The mind gets so saturated
with popular images...

1079
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:31,040
...it's often difficult, especially for people
under 20, to recall something unique.

1080
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,560
<i>That's Mr. Murrow.</i>

1081
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:37,390
<i>He owns the parking out on</i>
<i>Roosevelt Island. That's not all he does.</i>

1082
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,210
<i>What else does he do?</i>

1083
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:42,150
- <i>You really wanna know?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1084
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,420
- <i>Then this is off the record.</i>
- Erica!

1085
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,590
Who is it?

1086
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:51,880
It's Detective Mercer.
Could I have a minute with you?

1087
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:55,280
Yeah. Yeah, just a second.

1088
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,430
- Hey.
- Hey.

1089
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:10,700
I tried to call, but there was no answer.

1090
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:13,110
The ringer must be off.

1091
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:17,740
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1092
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:28,730
- It's pretty dark in here.
- I like it like that.

1093
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,600
Got something...

1094
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:38,800
Is this yours?

1095
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:45,040
- Where'd you find it?
- Spanish Harlem.

1096
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:50,600
A uniform pinched the suspect's girlfriend
trying to pawn it.

1097
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:53,480
He fit the description that you gave.

1098
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:57,600
Oh, my God.

1099
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:59,240
I need a favor from you.

1100
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:03,300
I'd like for you to come downtown
and ID him in a lineup.

1101
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:10,320
No. I can't.

1102
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,860
I understand you're nervous,
but you won't be alone in there.

1103
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:17,100
I promise.

1104
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:23,950
I'll get my stuff.

1105
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,900
Thanks.

1106
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,630
Okay, let's go.

1107
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:58,670
You're going to view five subjects,
and then I'm gonna ask you three questions:

1108
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:02,950
Do you recognize anyone? Where do you
know them from? And what did they do?

1109
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:06,180
Lights and blinds.

1110
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:10,890
Number one, approach the mirror.

1111
01:31:15,730 --> 01:31:17,190
No.

1112
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,270
Sit down.
Number two, approach the mirror.

1113
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:24,460
No.

1114
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:27,210
Sit down.
Number three, approach the mirror.

1115
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:40,270
No.

1116
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:43,950
Sit down.
Number four, approach the mirror.

1117
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,450
I can see them all. It's none of them.

1118
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:52,490
Sit down. You're sure?

1119
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:55,240
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1120
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:57,930
I really am.

1121
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,260
I'm so sorry.

1122
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,380
Damn, I thought we had him.
You think she just froze up?

1123
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:12,560
Doesn't really seem like the type,
you know?

1124
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,710
I don't know.

1125
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:20,770
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1126
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:23,150
That looked like
it was pretty tough on you.

1127
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:27,210
It was. I was kind of hoping
I was finally done.

1128
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:30,250
Yeah, well, I'm off now.
Let's go get some food.

1129
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,160
- No, I'm not hungry. That's okay.
- No, you need to eat.

1130
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:39,760
I can barely remember his hands.

1131
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:42,210
Perhaps you need to forget.

1132
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:44,490
I can't.

1133
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,050
I miss who I was with him.

1134
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,790
You know that feeling?

1135
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:56,600
You know...

1136
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:02,060
...this is Mughal. It was a gift
from David's grandmother.

1137
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,910
Speaking of gifts...

1138
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,780
You know, someone gave me
a gift the other night.

1139
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:15,790
Yeah?

1140
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:22,640
You recall that guy we saw on TV
at the coffee shop?

1141
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:28,100
The one I've been trying to put away
for three years.

1142
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:32,050
Apparently somebody else
must've had something against him...

1143
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:35,690
...because we're not talking
about a 9 mm here.

1144
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:40,140
It got real personal.

1145
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,540
Yeah, I read about it.

1146
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:54,250
We got some more information
on that subway shooting.

1147
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,850
Turns out there was a woman on the car.

1148
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:04,520
Now, all this time, we've been looking
for a man with a gun.

1149
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:07,920
It was a woman with a grudge.

1150
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,010
Well, I guess there's a lot of us
out there.

1151
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:23,370
You know, Erica, when I was a rookie...

1152
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,910
...I used to give myself this test.

1153
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:33,680
I would ask myself, if there was someone
that I knew that had committed a crime...

1154
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:36,890
...would I have the fortitude
to put them away?

1155
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:40,910
What kind of someone?

1156
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:47,560
Someone close to me.
Like the best friend I could ever...

1157
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:50,960
I could ever hope to have.

1158
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:54,990
And...?

1159
01:34:56,890 --> 01:35:01,290
I always hoped that I would have
the courage and the dedication to say yes.

1160
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:05,710
And do you?

1161
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:08,360
I do.

1162
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:12,050
And it's important that you know that.

1163
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:15,820
I know that.

1164
01:35:17,490 --> 01:35:19,880
It's what I admire about you.

1165
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:33,710
One more piece of evidence,
and she goes down.

1166
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:37,710
And I'm sure you'll find it.

1167
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:43,030
You're a good detective.
You miss nothing.

1168
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:47,770
I have to go.

1169
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:52,280
- I got it.
- Okay.

1170
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,020
Hang on.

1171
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,110
Hey.

1172
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,980
- I wonder what David would think of...
- Think of what?

1173
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:15,340
This woman with a grudge.

1174
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:21,260
I don't know.

1175
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,580
The dead don't talk.

1176
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,270
At least not to me.

1177
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:50,820
All right, thanks.

1178
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:18,070
Hey, can I get Joey Mortell?

1179
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:23,440
Crackheads.

1180
01:37:23,610 --> 01:37:27,390
<i>I got you stuck in traffic,</i>
<i>88th and 3rd Avenue.</i>

1181
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:31,690
<i>Pull over at the corner, Roma's Pizza.</i>
<i>Get yourself a slice.</i>

1182
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:35,160
- No, I'm not gonna be here that long.
- <i>You are gonna be there that long...</i>

1183
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:38,540
...because I got traffic backed up on 3rd
all the way to 96th Street.

1184
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:42,060
- Make yourself comfortable.
- <i>Well, I need you to do me a favor, okay?</i>

1185
01:37:42,450 --> 01:37:47,030
Can you run a trace on a call?
And I don't have a subpoena.

1186
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:49,050
<i>But you'll get one, right?</i>

1187
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:51,450
Yeah, if I have to.

1188
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:53,780
All right.

1189
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:56,870
Give me the date and the time.

1190
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,120
<i>Two days ago, July 20th...</i>

1191
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:02,030
...between 12 and 1:30 a.m.

1192
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,850
<i>All right. Okay, I need the number.</i>

1193
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:06,200
Hold on.

1194
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:12,340
- <i>It's 917...</i>
- Yeah.

1195
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:17,210
- <i>... 157</i>- <i>1431.</i>
- All right, give me the name.

1196
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:20,530
Look, it's private, like I said.

1197
01:38:20,690 --> 01:38:22,450
<i>Okay, it's that kind of private. I see.</i>

1198
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:25,520
All right. Okay, yeah, I got you covered.

1199
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:28,340
- Okay, just call me, all right?
- <i>You got it.</i>

1200
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,700
You seen this ring before?

1201
01:38:38,270 --> 01:38:39,760
It looks familiar.

1202
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,880
I got a name. Shauna Nelson.

1203
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:54,840
An address, a cell phone.

1204
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,600
What'd she look like?

1205
01:38:56,850 --> 01:39:01,270
She had two eyes, a mouth and a nose,
right in the middle of her face.

1206
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:03,950
Please get the fuck out of here.

1207
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:19,730
Yeah.

1208
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:28,960
Shut up. Shut up. That is...

1209
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:32,150
It's true.

1210
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:34,420
Hello?

1211
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:36,720
Hello?

1212
01:39:37,330 --> 01:39:38,700
- Do you know this number?
- No.

1213
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:41,010
Are you sure? 917.

1214
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:44,050
Hey, you guys, are 917... Fuck you guys.
I'll see you later, okay?

1215
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:45,910
- Bye.
- Later.

1216
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:05,880
Hey!

1217
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:10,640
- Are you Shauna?
- Did you just call me?

1218
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:14,490
Yeah, l... I got your number from
the pawn shop. You had my ring.

1219
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:19,000
Yeah. Motherfucker fucks some slut...

1220
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:21,370
...gives me the ring
as a fucking make-up gift.

1221
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:24,280
- Turns out he stole the shit.
- I wanna know where he is.

1222
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,420
Can you tell me where he is?

1223
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:29,360
- l...
- No. No.

1224
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:31,900
- I need an address. Phone number, anything.
- No.

1225
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,160
- Tell me where he is!
- No!

1226
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:37,840
I saw what they did to you.

1227
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:41,240
That shit can't happen to me.

1228
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:46,630
The call lasted
three minutes and 46 seconds.

1229
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:49,190
<i>From 12:26 to 12:30...</i>

1230
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:54,190
...from 917-157-1431 to your cell phone.

1231
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:56,820
Vicinity of Roosevelt Island.

1232
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:00,380
<i>Did she tell you she was someplace else?</i>

1233
01:41:00,990 --> 01:41:03,770
- Yes, she did.
- I'm sorry, man.

1234
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:05,180
But fuck her, right?

1235
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:08,190
- <i>Fuck her.</i>
- Yup.

1236
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:09,950
Fuck her.

1237
01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:12,140
Hey, do me a favor.

1238
01:41:12,950 --> 01:41:15,090
Keep this to yourself until...

1239
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:18,160
...I can get that subpoena.
- <i>Didn't even go on the hard drive.</i>

1240
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:42,290
<i>Action!</i>

1241
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:46,170
<i>Think you're fucking with me?!</i>

1242
01:41:56,740 --> 01:42:01,400
<i>Popped your motherfucking cherry!</i>
<i>Over there. Let's even shit out.</i>

1243
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,710
<i>Heads up!</i>

1244
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,820
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1245
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:14,330
<i>How cute. Lovebirds.</i>

1246
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:54,830
<i>Action!</i>

1247
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:58,680
<i>Think you're fucking with me?!</i>

1248
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:12,090
- You guys wanna make money or not?
- Hell, yeah.

1249
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:16,580
You know what to do. Stand on that corner
and keep an eye out.

1250
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:18,740
Show me you can do this.
Show me you're ready.

1251
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:22,390
Stand next to the four guys,
keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.

1252
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,940
Cops come, what do you do?

1253
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:25,350
- Run!
- Run, right?

1254
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:06,550
Good. Listen, motherfuckers,
stand on that sidewalk, keep an eye open.

1255
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:09,060
- How hard can that shit be? Right?
- Yeah.

1256
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:12,530
Good. So get going. Get on
that fucking sidewalk. Come on.

1257
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:24,760
You want something?

1258
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:26,620
I want my dog back.

1259
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:31,070
The fuck?

1260
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,890
Hi. Hi, boy. It's me.

1261
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:36,990
Hey. Hey, buddy. Hey.

1262
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:38,780
Do you remember me? Huh, boy?

1263
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,660
Come on, man.

1264
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:43,960
Go, go!

1265
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:47,960
No, you got me fucking waiting,
and I need an address!

1266
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:50,290
For Reed Bryant. He came in yesterday.

1267
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,050
Get away, bitch!

1268
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,450
Who's the bitch now?

1269
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:28,210
- <i>90 Clayton Avenue.</i>
- Thank you.

1270
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:00,530
Get the fuck out of the road!

1271
01:47:34,570 --> 01:47:37,860
- Hey, puppy.
- Don't you know there's a leash law?

1272
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:42,140
For a bitch like you!

1273
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,710
It's just you and me
and the fucking dog again, bitch!

1274
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:49,050
I made your boyfriend smile.
I'm gonna make you smile too, bitch!

1275
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:52,180
- You think you can come after me, huh?
- Get on the ground!

1276
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:56,100
Get on the fucking ground! Police!
On the ground! Lay flat on the ground!

1277
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:58,230
- Drop the gun, Erica!
- Stay out of this!

1278
01:47:58,410 --> 01:48:00,070
- No.
- This is between him and me!

1279
01:48:00,230 --> 01:48:02,620
- You do not have the right.
- Yes, I do!

1280
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:05,360
No. I have the right
to hunt him down and to shoot him.

1281
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:06,510
Then shoot him, then!

1282
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:09,370
I don't do that shit, I investigate it.
Now give me the gun.

1283
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,870
- And what are you gonna do, Mercer?
- Come on.

1284
01:48:12,730 --> 01:48:14,500
- You gonna arrest him?
- Give me the gun.

1285
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:16,150
- Arrest me, officer!
- Shut up!

1286
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,880
- Give me the gun!
- Come on, cuff me!

1287
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:20,770
- Shut up!
- Give me the gun, I said.

1288
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:23,770
Come on. Good girl.

1289
01:48:24,290 --> 01:48:26,300
That's it. Good girl.

1290
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:29,500
No.

1291
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,670
Now, if you're gonna use a gun,
you make sure it's legal.

1292
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:43,640
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1293
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:45,560
- Ain't nobody talking to you.
- Come on...

1294
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:48,070
- I saw that shit you did!
- You're a fucking cop!

1295
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:49,250
- Not tonight.
- Come on!

1296
01:48:49,450 --> 01:48:52,610
- Put me in cuffs! Get me out of here!
- Shut the fuck up!

1297
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:14,920
You can take me now.

1298
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:20,440
Problem is, if you go down,
I go down.

1299
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:24,320
No. I can't let you do that for me.

1300
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:38,080
So you've got one person left to shoot.

1301
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:40,810
What?

1302
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:44,470
You see, there was never any vigilante.

1303
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:48,250
It was just three punks
out on a killing spree.

1304
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:52,900
They got a taste for it up in Central Park.

1305
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:56,900
And they bought themselves a gun.

1306
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:03,240
And they turned on each other,
the way they do.

1307
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,280
And somehow...

1308
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:07,510
...I got winged and...

1309
01:50:08,450 --> 01:50:09,950
...I did what I had to do.

1310
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,110
Right here.

1311
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:20,350
- I can't.
- You only shoot bad guys?

1312
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:25,570
I've joined that club. Now you nick me,
graze me, but you wound me.

1313
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:31,510
From about 3 feet.

1314
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:41,980
- My hands are shaking.
- You just make sure you miss my heart.

1315
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:53,120
Damn! Motherfuck, that shit hurts!

1316
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:55,080
I'm sorry.

1317
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,250
I'm sorry.

1318
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:59,290
So am I.

1319
01:50:59,450 --> 01:51:03,200
Now you get out of here
before I lose my temper.

1320
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:56,220
Baby, look at you.
She left you too, huh?

1321
01:51:57,350 --> 01:52:01,000
That's okay. I got you now.
You're gonna be fine. Come here.

1322
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:03,200
Come here. Wait, wait, wait!

1323
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:19,640
10-13, 10-13. Officer hit.

1324
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:23,530
Three perps down at 90 Clayton.

1325
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:26,790
Send a bus.

1326
01:53:09,130 --> 01:53:13,920
<i>There is no going back</i>
<i>to that other person...</i>

1327
01:53:14,730 --> 01:53:16,700
<i>... that other place.</i>

1328
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:21,160
<i>This thing, this stranger...</i>

1329
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:24,800
<i>... she is all you are now.</i>
