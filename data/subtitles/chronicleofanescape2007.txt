On March 24, 1976



the Argentine Armed Forces
organized a coup d'etat.



ln 1985 the military,
who ruled for seven years



were taken to court
for human right violations:

in Latin America.



This story is based on the
testimony of two of the victims.

They'll beat us all.
Sort it out quietly.



Quiet. Ok?



Ok. Let go.
You too, Tano. Quiet.



Keep your mouth shut, ok?



They found your number
in my address book.



Why did you make up
the mimeograph story?



They beat me up really bad.



Did all sort of things.



Claudio... l had no choice.



Why choose me?



l needed time.
Do you understand?



l needed time for
my comrades to get away.



So you'll have a revolution...



by betraying those
who have done nothing?



Claudio...



when they see you're not involved,



they'll let you go.



You just have to hang in
there a bit longer.



Tano...



they won't let me go.



You've killed me, Tano.



DAY 45

- Good morning, sir.



You are our prisoners,

Jorge...



Take off your blindfold.
They're gone.



You're an asshole, Tano.



Why didn't you give up your comrades?
Motherfucker.



Take him to the bathroom, Almagro.



Yes, sir.
Can l take off my blindfold?



- Where?
- Right there.



So Tano knows you too?



Yes, but he says anything.
He's fried.



He told them about papers
he ordered from me.



l printed them,
and they caught me.



You're the mimeograph guy!



They have to let me go.



- They'll let me go.
- Me too.



Tano's the one who's staying.



l told them
you're not involved in it.



lt's all clear now.



They need you to give
them names.



Something.



But l have nothing to give them.



They don't buy it.
You must give them someone.



Don't you know anybody?



Someone from school...
someone really involved.



l don't know anyone
from school.



And in here?



You need to wake up.



Start looking around you.



Listen out.



Besides, it's not us.



lt's the revolutionaries.



lt's them they're after.



DAY 72



You're going to prison, Tano.



- l'm leaving?
- Yes, put your shoes on.



Easy, Tano. There's no rush.



This is the first case we've solved.



ln a few days the situation
will be clarified for you all.



Let's go, Tano.



But you must continue
to help us.



For some of you
we don't have enough.



You know what we want.



lnformations: names,
addresses, phone numbers.



They took him to prison.
Good.



- We'll be legal prisoners now.
- They'll bust me in jail.



When they find out
my brother's a rebel,



they won't leave me alone.



- They'll kill me.
- Why would they?



You're a nobody.



Sorry, Guillermo.



l should've taken the pill.



My brother warned me.



Knock it off. They'll beat us.



- Easy, Vasco.
My brother knew.



They're incompetent,
don't you see?



Easy.



Sorry.



l'm sorry.



l'm fine now.



So you knew him?



He squealed on me.



He did?
Vasco turned you in?



- What do you mean?
- He just let something slip.



They tortured him, he gave
my name and address.



Of course.



That's why you took
such good care of him.



Because he turned you in.



l should've taken care of Tano.



Easy. Just some medecine
for the trip home.



ls he ready?



Walk.



Single file!



Single file!



Let's go! Come on, kid!
Move it.



Easy, l said!



Let's go back in.



DAY 118



Eyes down!



Eyes on the floor!



Put these on, Jorge.
You're going home.



Are you scared, fagots?



<i>Wh</i>at are you waiting for?



You're all shit-scared?



Guillermo.
You're coming with me.



l have some questions for you.



l don't understand.



Wait here for me, Jorge.



Let's visit your mates,
see if they're where you said.



Jorge...



What do you want?



My name is Guillermo Fernandez.



Please tell my family.



- l live in Morón.
- Shut it.



l don't help guerrillas.



So don't bust my balls, ok?



Come on, Jorge.
Mind the door.



You're going home,
but choose your friends with care.



And don't print that bullshit.
lt's bad for you.



We know you're a good guy.



Don't worry your parents.



Head down, motherfucker!



Hello, Guillermo.
Want to go for a ride?



Take his cuffs off.



Head down!



Recognize this house?



Go ring the bell.



And mind what you do
or l'll blow your head off.



Look back and you're dead.
Got it?



Careful crossing the street.



l said go!



Guillermo Fernández?



A smoke?



Yes, please, sir.



Your hand.



Do we do a good job?



Only l've heard rumors
you were saying we don't.



Explains why you're
giving us bad adresses.



Ones we already know.
Like this one.



Or those of friends
who've already fled the country?



You put on a great show, kid.



Even the guards
thought highly of you.



You lied to us, Guillermo.
You kept information from us.



No, sir. Please understand.



l didn't know what l was doing.
l panicked.



You bought time
to save your friends.



No, sir, l was scared. Really.



l didn't hide anything.
l was so confused.



Do you know who l am?



- l'm the judge.
- Ajudge?



Will you send me to prison?



l decide whether we kill you
or let you go.



You haven't done much to stay alive.



l swear it wasn't an operation.



l didn't know
what l was saying.



My head was a mess...



You've got three days
to put your ideas in order,



and come up
with real information.



Either you open your head
or we do it.



l told you. lt's worse for those
who hold back information.



Who don't talk.



But you don't listen.



You're stupid.



Now you're all punished.



You must cooperate.



Tell the truth.



<i>Wh</i>en there's a lead
the investigation progresses.



The FBl started
in a house like this.



You have to tell what you know.



Or you'll end up like Tano.



Underground.



Get undressed!



Hands out.



Undress! Are you deaf?



The blindfolds.



Look at yourself, Vasco.
That's you.



Recognize yourself?



You don't?



And you, Gallego...
Recognize yourself?



Nor will anyone else outside.



Now you must talk.



Look at that mug!



Aren't you ashamed?



You're repulsive.



Here.



You betrayed me, Guillermo.



l was handling your case.



You were getting out,
now look at you.



You played me.



But now l'll get you clean.



Disinfectant!



How can someone this young
be so rotten inside?



l'll make you shine.



- Sir!
- You'll shine like new.



- Sir... Sir!
- You'll shine like new.



Shut up!



Don't forget.
Talk and you can still get out.



Guillermo!



Guille, are you ok?



l've got to get out.



Really?



l'm going with you.



DAY 119



l'm hungry.



Plenty of restaurants
on the outside.



We'll be out soon.



Have to hang on.



Gallego...



Still think they'll let you go?



- You'll end up like Tano.
- Nothing happened to Tano.



Lucas just wants to scare us.



<i>Wh</i>y else say we'd go to prison?



They killed Tano.



How do you know they killed him?



- And Jorge?
- Jorge was never with us.



Your case is closed, Gallego.



All our cases are closed.



We have to escape.



How do you suggest?



We must think like we did outside.



lt's easier than it seems.



- Gallego!
- Yes, Lucas.



And you, goalie, get dressed!



Think you can just lounge around?



Dirty bums!



Blindfold off, pants on.



Here. Have the scraps.



Thank you, Lucas.



Goal!



Come on, Argentina!



Were Lucas' scraps tasty?



You want me to reject food?



Don't pretend.
You're not tough.



- You're nobody.
- You left me alone.



<i>Wh</i>y didn't you do it?



What were you scared of, Gallego?



- We're all scared here.
- l wasn't scared.



This lunatic wanted
to hit Rivas with the pan.



- You held the weapon.
- lt was there.



lf it went wrong,
we'd all have paid.



l'm not going to kill anyone.



- You're terrified, Gallego.
- You can't talk.



Acted like Lucas' pal,
now look at you!



l want to get out alive.



My way.



DAY 120



How do you take them off?



l've got a plan.



A plan?



Fuck off.



- What's that?
- A screw.



- What for?
- To open the window.



l know they open,
l've cleaned them.



- Then what?
- Climb out using blankets.



They're too worn.
They won't hold.



We'll tie them with the straps.
They'll hold.



- And then?
- We'll be out.



On the outside.
We go out stark naked, right?



Nice plan! Great!



You'd rather tunnel out
with a spoon?



And when we're outside?



Know what you'll find
when you open the window?.



- Get up!
- Get up! Let's go!



Attention!



Attention!



Attention!



Attention!



Quiet! Quiet!



Quiet!



You think you're cool
because you went to college?



No, sir.



They teach you
to handle guns there?



No, sir.



You'd like to escape, right?



You'd all like to escape.



You're guilty.
That's how it is.



l know that's how it is.



We'll kill whoever
wants to escape.



Start thinking
about your last request.



Let's see.



How about you, Gallego?



<i>Wh</i>at's your last request?



Come on!



l want...



l'd like to call home.



And you, Guillermo?



What do you want?



Will you grant it?



We are men of honour.



We are not filthy liars.



Of course we will.
l'm listening.



lf you're going to kill me,
l want to see your faces.



Tie them up!



Get up!



You're killing prisoners
without telling me?



You guards are to blame.



You spoil these bitches rotten.



No, Hugo.
l make good use of them.



Think. The more you mistreat them,
the less they talk?



Then it's you who's rotten.



Do you feel pity for them?



You do your job. l'll do mine.



Less than one day left.



Come on!



You're real scum!



Treat you well
and you pay me back like this.



That was the last time, Guillermo.



Good night.



Why do you play tough?



Want to get killed?



- They heard us.
- They didn't hear anything.



- l want to finish it all.
- We're already dead.



We're dead.



l won't be here
when they come for me.



We're disappearing.



Gallego!



You're disappearing!



DAY 121

Claudio.



What is it?



lt has to be today.
Tomorrow l'll be dead.



Tucumano and Lucas are out.



They're the most unpredictable.



These guys are very methodical.



They've fed us.



Now they count us
and clear the dishes.



They count us again at dawn.



Just before sunrise.



That gives us three hours.



Tonight?



Let's pray.



What's up?



What are you doing?



Go back to sleep.



Shut up!
Do what l tell you.
