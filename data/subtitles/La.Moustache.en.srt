1
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,781
What if I shaved my moustache off?

2
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,251
What?

3
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,289
What would you say
if I shaved my moustache off?

4
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,555
No idea. I like you with it.

5
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,098
I don't know you without it.

6
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,727
How can you stand such a hot bath?

7
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,199
We have to get going soon.

8
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,711
I said we'd be there at 8:30.

9
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,746
That way, we won't be back late.

10
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,944
I'm going to the supermarket
to get stuff for breakfast.

11
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,454
- Can you put the CD back to the start?
- Yes.

12
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:47,060
"LA MOUSTACHE"

13
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,836
Still in that bath?

14
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,674
No, I'm dressing.

15
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,344
Why didn't you let me in?

16
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,285
I couldn't find my key.

17
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,788
My shoelace broke.

18
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,129
- Found some others?
- Other what?

19
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,833
Shoelaces.

20
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,307
No, I switched shoes.

21
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,441
Marc.

22
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,585
Can you bring me a towel, please?

23
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,804
Listen, Marc...

24
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,487
I'm not against the idea,
but we're running so late.

25
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,893
Isn't it too sexy
for my goddaughter's birthday?

26
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,730
They like my tarty look.

27
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,400
Do you? You haven't said.

28
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,340
Yes, I like it.

29
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,321
Shit, I wanted that space.

30
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,222
- We'll never find a space.
- Yes, we will.

31
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,351
Believe me, we won't.

32
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,493
- What's so funny?
- You.

33
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:55,302
I usually hate angry drivers,
but I adore you.

34
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,069
You know what?

35
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,577
Go on up while I park the car.

36
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,875
Why? I'll stay with you.
I don't mind.

37
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,849
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

38
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,748
You're sure?

39
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,999
I forgot Lara's present.

40
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,609
- Know the door code?
- Yes.

41
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,622
Hi.

42
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,429
Come on in.

43
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,200
No more kisses.

44
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,533
After 15 years of kissing guys,
I've had enough.

45
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,102
What's up?

46
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,806
- Hi, Marc.
- Good evening.

47
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,173
Hello, Lara.

48
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,284
Aren't you saying hello?
Don't you recognize him?

49
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,014
I do. He's Marc.

50
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,448
Bravo.

51
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,362
Why "bravo"?

52
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,987
I don't know.

53
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,158
I wanted to say "bravo," so I said "bravo".

54
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,726
Ah merde...

55
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,971
I like it... your hair.

56
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,476
Thanks.

57
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,808
- Serge warned me.
- Warned you?

58
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,714
He told me about your hair.
But I'd have noticed anyway.

59
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,684
Got nothing against garlic?

60
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:51,951
Off to bed, sweetheart.
Brush your teeth.

61
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,108
That's not what happened.

62
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,806
It is.

63
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,972
Not at all.

64
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,539
You're so two-faced, Agnès.
You can't help it.

65
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,085
Remember the radiators?

66
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,353
Where did Marc go?

67
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,955
What radiators?

68
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,398
Well, what radiators?

69
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,659
The radiators...

70
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,563
One day, about 10 years ago,

71
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:48,342
Agnès and I spent a weekend with some
people we knew vaguely, in Burgundy.

72
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:55,517
Three couples, walks in the forest,
errands in the village, an open fire.

73
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,613
A nightmare.

74
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,180
It was winter.

75
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:03,524
On arriving, they explained over and over

76
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:08,590
that they couldn't heat all the rooms
unless the radiators were on low.

77
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,104
If not, the fuses would blow.

78
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:20,975
That night, this young lady ignored orders
and put the heating in our room on high.

79
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,537
The fuses blew.

80
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,015
We changed the fuses.

81
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,542
We had a lecture from our host...

82
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,215
- Christian, right?
- I don't remember.

83
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:37,820
Anyway, on the second night,
we were playing Scrabble by the fire.

84
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,832
Agnès went up to bed before us.

85
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,765
The fuses didn't blow.

86
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,132
Everyone thought she'd gotten the message.

87
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,869
But when we went up too,

88
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:55,277
we were horrified to find
that it was minus 5 in every room,

89
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,474
while ours was like a sauna.

90
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,144
Everything was crystal clear.

91
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:06,681
She'd turned the other radiators off
to put ours on full.

92
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,718
Okay, this far, you could say
she was just being cheeky.

93
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,856
But the best part
was when we asked her for an explanation.

94
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,697
She denied everything emphatically.

95
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,761
We kept asking her.

96
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,572
We proved it had to be her,
and she never confessed.

97
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:30,081
And that's what I admire, because you won't
even admit on your deathbed

98
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,118
you turned those radiators off.

99
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:39,324
Because I didn't turn them off.

100
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,621
Who turned them off, then?

101
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,255
I don't know, but it wasn't me.

102
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,672
Nadia!

103
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:47,661
Nadia!

104
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,328
Serge doesn't seem happy.

105
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:14,059
He has to make a mockery
of everything all the time.

106
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,761
Pathetic, isn't it?

107
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:19,599
Did Nadia talk to you?

108
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:21,229
Stop.

109
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:23,365
Stop what?

110
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,603
The dinner post-mortem:

111
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:30,512
Serge's mental state, his despair.
I don't give a shit.

112
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:36,677
Find another subject, then.
What do you want to talk about?

113
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,086
Stop it, will you?

114
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:40,819
What's the matter?

115
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:43,794
Did I say something that upset you?

116
00:13:43,862 --> 00:13:47,025
We can talk. We talk, don't we?

117
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:49,124
I want you to stop.

118
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:51,897
The joke's gone on long enough.

119
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,404
I'm sick of it now, so stop.

120
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:59,841
Stop the car.

121
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:01,504
Pull over.

122
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:07,841
Explain.

123
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:12,285
Don't say you haven't noticed.

124
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:15,986
Noticed what?

125
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:17,426
Tell me.

126
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,727
- Is it that hard to say?
- No, it isn't.

127
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:26,601
I just shouldn't have to say it.

128
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:27,900
My moustache.

129
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:32,869
Can't you feel something missing?

130
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:34,879
What?

131
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:39,410
I've shaved my moustache off.

132
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:42,945
I don't understand.

133
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:50,827
Are you asleep?

134
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:54,227
No.

135
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:55,994
What are you thinking about?

136
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,769
Your moustache, of course.

137
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,189
You know, in the car earlier,
I thought...

138
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:26,528
if you carried on, I'd get really scared.

139
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,697
I got scared.

140
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:32,930
You carried on.

141
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,832
Please stop it. It scares me.

142
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:41,675
So don't start again.

143
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:45,444
You're the one starting again.
Stop it!

144
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,985
Agnès.

145
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:49,748
It doesn't matter.

146
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:50,981
Look at me.

147
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:54,514
I've shaved it off, but I can grow it back.

148
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,461
Why are you doing this?

149
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:10,269
You know you've never had a moustache!

150
00:16:10,342 --> 00:16:14,574
If it had gone, Serge and Nadia
would have noticed.

151
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:17,308
You went up first.

152
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:23,018
You realize what you're saying?

153
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:29,254
Give me the phone.

154
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:48,740
Nadia, it's Agnès.

155
00:16:48,814 --> 00:16:52,750
Sorry to wake you, but I have a question.

156
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:53,978
<i>I'm sleeping.</i>

157
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:56,111
Was Marc different tonight?

158
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:57,815
<i>No.</i>

159
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:59,686
Had his moustache gone?

160
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:03,524
<i>What do you mean?</i>

161
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:09,659
Suppose I'd asked you to deny
he'd had a moustache when he'd had one.

162
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:11,600
<i>I don't follow you.</i>

163
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,698
Never mind.
I just want you to answer one question.

164
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,869
- Has Marc ever had a moustache?
- <i>No.</i>

165
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:25,315
<i>You sound like you're having fun,</i>
<i>but we're trying to get some sleep here.</i>

166
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,487
You warned them.

167
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:43,331
Listen, I have a long day tomorrow.

168
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:46,030
I'm taking a sleeping pill.

169
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:33,580
Agnès?

170
00:18:33,652 --> 00:18:35,483
I'm sleeping!

171
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:42,344
Morning.

172
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,409
Hi.

173
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:44,716
Okay?

174
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,186
This gives you the geometric axis.

175
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,487
Right!

176
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:54,697
I'll try again.

177
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,529
I'll go out and come back in.

178
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:58,398
Look at me this time.

179
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,983
Okay? In shape?

180
00:21:19,424 --> 00:21:22,916
- A quick coffee?
- No, a coffee.

181
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:25,053
Not a quick coffee. A coffee.

182
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:28,956
Incredible.

183
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:31,501
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

184
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:01,021
- What are you doing?
- Obviously, having a coffee.

185
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:03,431
You said you'd be back then...

186
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:04,991
Then I had a coffee.

187
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:07,663
Fine. I'll have one, too.

188
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:14,072
You're odd this morning.

189
00:22:14,145 --> 00:22:16,136
Did you have a fight?

190
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:22,211
Haven't you noticed?

191
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:26,417
Sure. I've noticed you're odd.

192
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:28,686
Let's get to work.

193
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:43,469
The advantage is we're dealing
with neophytes and experts.

194
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,339
The message changes,
but not the words and visuals.

195
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:48,709
I like that idea.

196
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:52,441
Of course. Whatever you want.

197
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:57,986
No, Monday isn't possible.

198
00:22:58,056 --> 00:23:01,082
We're on a tight deadline.

199
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:06,831
- You're a jerk.
- You notice that?

200
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:08,889
Of course I notice.

201
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,935
How long has it been?

202
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:12,936
Three years since you both quit.

203
00:23:13,004 --> 00:23:16,440
All that effort. It's totally dumb.

204
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:23,379
Want to come and eat?

205
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:38,025
Got the photos for your badge?

206
00:23:38,096 --> 00:23:40,189
No, I forgot. Tomorrow.

207
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:05,184
Go for it.

208
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:08,487
That's good!

209
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,550
Go on, pass!

210
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:15,025
Pass to the center!

211
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,794
- Score!
- Okay?

212
00:24:16,868 --> 00:24:19,666
Fine, but we're losing.

213
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:41,222
I got sushi if you want.

214
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,522
I just had some.

215
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:45,721
These are delicious.

216
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,564
They'll score again before the end.

217
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:04,811
There's some wasabi there.

218
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:09,909
There. It's over. A disaster.

219
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:16,492
I'm disappointed.

220
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:18,791
Really disappointed.

221
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:27,432
Men who hate football are so boring.

222
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,574
You've been smoking?

223
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:40,549
Yes, I've been smoking.

224
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:43,744
That's pathetic.

225
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:04,463
Look!

226
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,469
What's that smell?

227
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:09,472
Look at this!
What is this, huh?

228
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,007
Marc!

229
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,510
- You're mad.
- What is it?

230
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:17,946
You're mad.

231
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:36,058
Don't touch me!

232
00:30:30,741 --> 00:30:33,403
I'm not lying to you, Marc.

233
00:30:33,477 --> 00:30:38,039
I've never lied to you.

234
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:39,912
I know.

235
00:30:42,953 --> 00:30:45,183
That's the worst part.

236
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:53,393
You really believe you had a moustache?

237
00:31:02,606 --> 00:31:05,040
Should I see a psychiatrist?

238
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:10,280
We don't know any psychiatrists.

239
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:17,850
I think we need to get help, yes.

240
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,834
You weren't going to say good-bye?

241
00:32:01,902 --> 00:32:03,870
I didn't want to wake you.

242
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:06,600
Are you working all weekend?

243
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,835
Not tomorrow, I hope.

244
00:32:10,077 --> 00:32:11,704
You know...

245
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:14,077
Remember Stéphanie in La Rochelle?

246
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:17,709
She had hallucinations.
François was panicked.

247
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:22,347
Then she saw someone,
and the whole thing blew over.

248
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:25,950
I don't think he even put her on medication.

249
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,064
Shall I call François?

250
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:36,030
Yes, call him.

251
00:32:41,942 --> 00:32:45,241
It's like freaking out when you're high.

252
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,110
Just remember, it ends at some point.

253
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:50,309
It has to end.

254
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,103
Excuse me.

255
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:20,307
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

256
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:21,848
Look.

257
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:25,373
Do you see a difference here?

258
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:29,081
Yes, the moustache.

259
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:32,148
It's important for me.

260
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:34,820
You're sure I have a moustache here?

261
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:39,161
Yes, I'm sure, absolutely positive.

262
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:43,067
- You are?
- Yes.

263
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:44,502
Thank you.

264
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:49,799
Yes, I remember them.
They're old friends of Serge.

265
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:52,277
How are they?

266
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:54,780
I'll see them tomorrow anyway.

267
00:33:54,848 --> 00:33:58,011
By the way, Armelle mentioned a guy.

268
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:00,679
Is he a priest or not?

269
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,121
You're back?

270
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:09,060
It's Marc. I didn't expect him
until this evening.

271
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:10,926
Take care.

272
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,160
Nadia, I'm seeing you tomorrow.

273
00:34:14,234 --> 00:34:16,202
Good-bye.

274
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:23,105
The agency was too much for you?

275
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:25,577
You didn't feel good?

276
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,273
I wanted to be with you.

277
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:28,815
Come here.

278
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:47,199
Do you want to talk?

279
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:50,828
I'd like to talk, but this is a bad time.

280
00:34:50,904 --> 00:34:52,667
We'll hurt each other.

281
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:58,242
I called the guy who helped Stéphanie.

282
00:34:58,312 --> 00:35:01,941
He can take us on,
but not for another 10 days.

283
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:05,007
I have another address that might be good.

284
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:07,246
That one can see us on Monday.

285
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:11,023
What do you think?

286
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:13,889
- You think 10 days is too long?
- Yes.

287
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:18,022
- Don't you?
- Yes, I do.

288
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:23,898
It's cold.

289
00:35:27,674 --> 00:35:30,040
What shall we do?

290
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,510
Do you want to go out?

291
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:36,515
Right now? No, I don't, really.

292
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,481
We can't stay cooped up in here.

293
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:47,083
We could go swimming.

294
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:52,331
Since you weren't here,
I hadn't planned anything.

295
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:54,299
You prefer that?

296
00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:58,896
Know what? We'll meet halfway.

297
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:01,600
We'll go and buy you a jacket.

298
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:23,962
Which one?

299
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,331
- Try this one on, just to see.
- All right.

300
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:58,126
Don't I look like a clown in this?

301
00:36:58,198 --> 00:37:00,359
No. I think it suits you.

302
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:04,937
I'll treat you.

303
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:09,169
Chiffonnade of trepanned baby mullet.
It's so pretentious.

304
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:11,905
- It's a new chef.
- Really?

305
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,972
It's all different.
That thing with the coulis has gone.

306
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,887
Do you want to leave?

307
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:24,890
Do you want to?

308
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,653
No, I'm kidding.

309
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:31,459
Would you like an aperitif?

310
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:33,432
Yes. Champagne.

311
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,797
Two.

312
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:37,302
I'll leave you to choose.

313
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:38,668
You have cigarettes?

314
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:42,106
- Marlboro, Marlboro Light?
- Light.

315
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:44,040
No, not Light.

316
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:48,905
What's the matter?

317
00:38:09,002 --> 00:38:12,267
Let's not pretend we're not stressed out.

318
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:16,036
We'll quit again later.
It's not a priority now.

319
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,818
We did everything right today.

320
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,445
We bought you a jacket.

321
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:31,685
You hate it, I don't.
You'll never wear it.

322
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:33,589
That's what couples do.

323
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:49,270
It's not good?

324
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,375
Yes, it's good.

325
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:56,673
Actually, no. It tastes odd.

326
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:03,052
Or maybe it's me.

327
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:08,356
I feel as if I was...

328
00:39:08,428 --> 00:39:10,623
color-blind or...

329
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:13,598
dyslexic, I don't know.

330
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:19,635
Dessert?

331
00:39:19,706 --> 00:39:25,906
No. I'm afraid the meringues
might end up tasting of beans.

332
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:35,446
Agnès, I'm here.

333
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:40,893
I'll always be here, whatever happens.

334
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:44,723
I don't want us to lose each other.

335
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:50,199
I don't want that, either.

336
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:28,502
Please, no music tonight.

337
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,544
<i>Marc, it's Bruno.</i>

338
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:45,318
<i>We're slaving away here without you.</i>

339
00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:47,587
<i>It'd be good to hear from you.</i>

340
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:48,992
<i>Bye.</i>

341
00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:51,223
<i>It's Dad.</i>

342
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:52,788
<i>Apparently, you're not in.</i>

343
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:56,393
<i>I could try the mobile,</i>
<i>but I don't like those things.</i>

344
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:02,136
<i>It's nothing urgent, just a reminder</i>
<i>we expect you both for lunch tomorrow.</i>

345
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,234
<i>Take care, and see you then.</i>

346
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:07,911
<i>All messages have been erased.</i>

347
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:16,446
You put the photos away?

348
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:19,251
What photos?

349
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:20,793
The photos of Bali.

350
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:25,230
Of Bali?

351
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:31,237
The photos of Bali that were on the table.

352
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:41,011
<i>Marc and Agnês aren't in right now.</i>

353
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,447
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

354
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:45,485
<i>It's Bruno. Are you there?</i>

355
00:41:45,552 --> 00:41:46,917
<i>I've tried your mobile.</i>

356
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:49,512
<i>Please call me, we have to talk.</i>

357
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:51,648
Why don't you call him back?

358
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:54,956
I asked you if you put the photos away.

359
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,559
I'd rather talk about that
after Monday's appointment.

360
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:02,761
That's not what I'm saying.

361
00:42:02,836 --> 00:42:05,566
I asked if you put the Bali photos away.

362
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:28,112
<i>Marc and Agnês aren't in right now.</i>

363
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:30,274
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

364
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,443
<i>It's Bruno. Marc...</i>

365
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,215
<i>If you're there, answer.</i>
<i>This is absurd.</i>

366
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:41,022
<i>What's going on?</i>

367
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:43,028
Just a second.

368
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:55,897
Bruno, this has to stop right now.

369
00:42:55,976 --> 00:43:00,913
You did this crazy thing
to keep Agnès happy.

370
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:03,848
I can live with that, but she's in a bad way.

371
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,009
<i>What's wrong?</i>

372
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:08,714
Couldn't you see the problem she has,
inventing such a crazy idea?

373
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:09,914
That she's in danger?

374
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,151
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

375
00:43:12,225 --> 00:43:15,922
- She called you two days ago.
- <i>To say what?</i>

376
00:43:18,164 --> 00:43:21,565
To ignore my moustache.

377
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:23,067
<i>I don't understand.</i>

378
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:28,340
Did you notice I'd shaved it off?

379
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:30,569
<i>No. Hold on.</i>

380
00:43:30,643 --> 00:43:33,612
<i>Agnês says you had a moustache?</i>

381
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,238
No, that I didn't.

382
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:39,183
<i>Exactly. You haven't had one once</i>
<i>in the last 15 years.</i>

383
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:42,050
<i>What is all this?</i>

384
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:45,023
- She's coming...
- <i>Put her on.</i>

385
00:43:48,461 --> 00:43:50,929
Who was that?

386
00:43:50,997 --> 00:43:52,988
Nobody.

387
00:43:55,668 --> 00:43:57,568
What's wrong?

388
00:44:14,587 --> 00:44:16,578
Did you just call?

389
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:22,189
Yes, you could call it a problem.

390
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:29,796
I realize that.

391
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,670
Shall I put him back on?

392
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:38,475
He'll call you back.

393
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:42,738
That's kind, Bruno.

394
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:45,580
You're very kind. See you soon.

395
00:44:58,098 --> 00:44:59,793
So it's me?

396
00:45:19,285 --> 00:45:22,186
It's 12:15.

397
00:45:22,255 --> 00:45:27,420
Are we going to your parents',
or would you rather not?

398
00:45:27,494 --> 00:45:29,758
I'd rather not.

399
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:31,922
Okay, I'll call them.

400
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:44,108
Catherine, it's Agnès.

401
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:48,443
I'm really sorry to call you so late,
but Marc just called.

402
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:50,710
They're rushed off their feet.

403
00:45:50,783 --> 00:45:52,808
He'll have to be at the agency all day.

404
00:45:55,722 --> 00:45:58,589
Yes, as usual.

405
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,887
He said he'd call you this afternoon.

406
00:46:05,465 --> 00:46:08,400
I'm really sorry.

407
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:09,526
Take care.

408
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:14,062
While you're at it,
cancel Serge and Nadia, too.

409
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,735
Cancel who?

410
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,471
Serge and Nadia.

411
00:46:21,247 --> 00:46:24,683
Serge and Nadia Scheffer.

412
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:27,743
Your ex and his Russian wife.

413
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,913
Dinner tonight?

414
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:33,652
Dinner last Thursday
with your goddaughter?

415
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:38,821
You don't know them?

416
00:46:43,203 --> 00:46:45,763
And Bruno?
Do you know Bruno?

417
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:48,739
He called earlier.

418
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:51,572
Yes, of course.

419
00:46:51,644 --> 00:46:55,444
And you just called my parents
to cancel lunch?

420
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:58,245
Your mother, yes.

421
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:07,626
Okay, you spoke to my mother,
but we were having lunch at my parents'?

422
00:47:18,037 --> 00:47:20,130
Your father's dead, Marc.

423
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:24,472
Your father died last year.

424
00:47:26,879 --> 00:47:30,474
You said "your parents,"
not "your mother."

425
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:38,282
I heard you, I swear I did.

426
00:47:42,595 --> 00:47:47,259
I think I'll go and lie down
for a while.

427
00:47:49,602 --> 00:47:52,628
Agnès, you're not going to vanish?

428
00:47:52,705 --> 00:47:54,605
Not you.

429
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:58,994
You're sure he's asleep?

430
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:02,694
With what I gave him,
he'll be out for hours.

431
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:05,897
What time are they coming?

432
00:50:05,972 --> 00:50:09,203
They didn't say.
They'll be here soon.

433
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:12,711
Even with that dose, he may not go quietly.

434
00:50:15,381 --> 00:50:20,250
They're used to it, you know.
They bring what they need.

435
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,722
Will they use a straitjacket?
I couldn't bear that.

436
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:29,228
The straitjacket is purely chemical
these days.

437
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:32,197
They'll give him a shot.

438
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:34,165
He'll rest.

439
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:58,688
Bruno, I'm scared.

440
00:50:58,758 --> 00:51:00,726
Having regrets?

441
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:02,055
No.

442
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:06,588
It's too late to stop things now.

443
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:09,032
We had no choice.

444
00:51:25,017 --> 00:51:26,416
Are you okay?

445
00:51:53,846 --> 00:51:55,711
Boulevard Emile Augier.

446
00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:00,046
What number?

447
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,713
I'll tell you when to stop.

448
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,728
The boulevard ends here.

449
00:52:19,805 --> 00:52:24,174
We've passed it, then.
Can you go back?

450
00:52:27,813 --> 00:52:29,508
I can't see.

451
00:52:31,817 --> 00:52:34,513
I don't believe it. I was born here.

452
00:52:42,728 --> 00:52:45,253
You can't remember the number?

453
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:49,165
No, I can't remember it!
Can you turn that off?

454
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:05,109
<i>You have just dialed</i>
<i>an invalid number.</i>

455
00:53:14,794 --> 00:53:20,096
<i>You have just dialed</i>
<i>an invalid number.</i>

456
00:53:32,378 --> 00:53:35,040
<i>France Télécom, Corinne speaking.</i>

457
00:53:35,114 --> 00:53:40,518
I'd like the number of Mr. And Mrs. Thiriez,
Boulevard Emile Augier.

458
00:53:40,586 --> 00:53:42,053
That's Thiriez with a "Z".

459
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:43,247
<i>In Paris?</i>

460
00:53:43,322 --> 00:53:45,222
Yes, Paris 16.

461
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:47,156
<i>Certainly, sir.</i>

462
00:53:48,494 --> 00:53:51,725
<i>Sorry, I'm afraid that number's unlisted.</i>

463
00:53:51,797 --> 00:53:53,822
I know, but it's my parents'.

464
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:55,594
<i>Sorry, I can't.</i>

465
00:53:55,668 --> 00:53:57,329
This is an emergency.

466
00:53:57,403 --> 00:53:59,530
I must speak to my mother now.

467
00:53:59,605 --> 00:54:01,596
<i>You don't know her number?</i>

468
00:54:01,674 --> 00:54:03,266
Of course I do!

469
00:54:03,342 --> 00:54:06,334
<i>Sir, I can't.</i>
<i>I have other calls waiting.</i>

470
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:10,143
Wait! I need to know
if my father is alive or dead!

471
00:54:10,216 --> 00:54:13,310
- <i>I understand, but...</i>
- You don't understand.

472
00:54:13,386 --> 00:54:19,256
If he's alive, but my wife says he's dead,
then something serious is going on...

473
00:54:19,325 --> 00:54:20,690
<i>Good-bye, sir.</i>

474
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:28,463
Where to now?

475
00:54:28,534 --> 00:54:30,661
Drive.

476
00:54:52,224 --> 00:54:54,954
It's me. I'm at La Muette.

477
00:54:55,027 --> 00:54:56,619
Can you come and get me?

478
00:54:56,696 --> 00:54:59,392
<i>La Muette? At your mother's?</i>

479
00:54:59,465 --> 00:55:01,592
Yes, I'm at my mother's.

480
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:03,601
Hurry, I'm waiting.

481
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:48,237
Can you wait a second?

482
00:56:11,704 --> 00:56:12,864
Shit!

483
00:56:35,828 --> 00:56:37,819
Terminal 1 or 2?

484
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:41,398
Sir!

485
00:56:45,204 --> 00:56:47,570
Terminal 1 or 2?

486
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:51,375
2.

487
00:57:05,591 --> 00:57:08,389
Too late for Hong Kong?

488
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,655
For your luggage it is.

489
00:57:10,729 --> 00:57:12,094
No luggage.

490
01:00:18,884 --> 01:00:22,718
I'll be home when this card gets there.

491
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:26,588
This is the view from my window.

492
01:00:26,658 --> 01:00:31,027
I'd like your eyes to see it.

493
01:00:31,096 --> 01:00:35,123
Without your eyes,
I see nothing.

494
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:26,764
You didn't buy it in the end?

495
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,702
What?

496
01:14:28,773 --> 01:14:30,900
That engraving.

497
01:14:30,975 --> 01:14:32,340
No.

498
01:14:35,646 --> 01:14:38,240
He wouldn't lower his price?

499
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,880
That's right.

500
01:14:42,953 --> 01:14:46,411
Good. I don't know
where we'd have put it.

501
01:14:50,494 --> 01:14:55,488
I can't stand packing.

502
01:14:55,566 --> 01:14:59,263
You don't care, do you?

503
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:06,644
You just don't care.
You don't care at all.

504
01:15:10,414 --> 01:15:13,440
Are you going to keep this?

505
01:15:13,517 --> 01:15:17,954
It's okay on holiday,
but back in Paris I'm not so sure.

506
01:15:30,434 --> 01:15:33,301
What do you two want to do tonight?

507
01:15:33,371 --> 01:15:36,534
Shall we eat together
or meet at the casino?

508
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:41,041
Can you hear me?

509
01:15:41,112 --> 01:15:44,411
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

510
01:15:46,851 --> 01:15:49,411
What's this clown's jacket?

511
01:15:54,191 --> 01:15:56,989
Don't tell me you got this here!

512
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:12,505
You've got foam everywhere.

513
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:51,137
Okay? Want to go back?

514
01:16:51,215 --> 01:16:52,341
Please.

515
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:55,146
I'll have to let them know.

516
01:16:55,219 --> 01:16:56,618
You'll come back?

517
01:16:56,687 --> 01:16:58,985
Of course.

518
01:16:59,056 --> 01:17:00,717
I'll come with you.

519
01:17:21,745 --> 01:17:23,679
It's not like them to go.

520
01:17:23,747 --> 01:17:28,184
We leave tomorrow.
We may not see them again.

521
01:17:28,252 --> 01:17:30,516
We were looking for you lovebirds.

522
01:17:30,588 --> 01:17:32,351
Us, too. We were leaving.

523
01:17:32,423 --> 01:17:33,822
One last drink together.

524
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:36,121
Just one, then.

525
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,184
- Can I see?
- Here you go.

526
01:17:38,262 --> 01:17:41,720
- Aren't we cute?
- Got any others of us?

527
01:17:41,799 --> 01:17:45,166
This was on the junk.

528
01:17:45,236 --> 01:17:48,364
- How about that drink?
- Let's go.

529
01:17:50,908 --> 01:17:53,570
They're getting on your nerves tonight.

530
01:17:53,644 --> 01:17:56,135
No, I like them.

531
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,080
We don't have to see them back in Paris.

532
01:18:29,179 --> 01:18:31,113
Agnès.

533
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,412
Say nothing.

534
01:19:14,525 --> 01:19:17,119
I've nearly finished.

535
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:24,831
I almost thought you'd
shave your moustache off earlier.

536
01:19:24,902 --> 01:19:28,030
I'd like to see you without it one day.

537
01:19:54,098 --> 01:19:55,963
I'll wear that tomorrow.

538
01:20:21,258 --> 01:20:24,352
I'll put the tea set in your case.

539
01:20:31,335 --> 01:20:33,735
What are you doing?

540
01:20:33,804 --> 01:20:35,738
