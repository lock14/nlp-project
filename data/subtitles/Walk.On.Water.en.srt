1
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,247
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:02,019
...we are now approaching another
great symbol of this country...

3
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,719
...and one of the most
famous places in Turkey...

4
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,526
...the Bosphorus Bridge,
connecting Europe and Asia.

5
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,061
In the last 2000 years...

6
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,604
...many nations wanted
to control this special place...

7
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:19,438
...that was used for transportation
between Europe and the Middle East.

8
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,877
This bridge was opened in 1973.

9
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:27,949
And as you will be able to see,
it is always full of traffic.

10
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,782
If you look further down,
you will be able to see...

11
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,924
...the Sultan Mehmet Bridge...

12
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,651
...that was opened in 1988...

13
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,194
...after the city expanded
even more.

14
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,840
We are arriving to Uskudar...

15
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,744
...the Asian part of Istanbul.

16
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,645
Please be careful
when you leave the boat...

17
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,414
...and take all
your belongings with you.

18
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,156
When in Uskudar,
walk along the promenade...

19
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:44,930
...and eat some of the fish
our local fishermen bring in daily.

20
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,979
Excuse me.

21
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,089
Hasan. Hasan.

22
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,961
Help!

23
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,732
Help! Help! Hasan.

24
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,594
Hasan.

25
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,165
- Help.
- What happened?

26
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,669
Please help.

27
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,036
Hasan. Hasan.

28
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,575
Hasan.

29
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,644
Here he is!

30
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,518
Shalom, everybody!

31
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,758
Well done, Eyal. Excellent job.

32
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,791
- Thanks.
- Champagne, anyone?

33
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,965
Let's have a drink.

34
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,727
A real celebrity.
Give yourself a blow job.

35
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,460
MASTER OF TERROR
TERMINATED

36
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,303
Not only in Israel...

37
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,473
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

38
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,113
- You speak to Iris?
- Yesterday.

39
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,344
- And?
- She sounds okay.

40
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,042
Strange.
She's not answering my calls.

41
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,150
- Quiet, please. Cheers!
- Cheers!

42
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,321
Shouldrt we say something?

43
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,692
Well... To Eyal,
who loves his profession.

44
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,591
Great job.

45
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,964
- Anything to add, Menachem?
- Very funny. I won't say anything.

46
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,141
Cheers!

47
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,637
Cheers!

48
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,734
Iris!

49
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,109
Iris?

50
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,748
Iris, are you asleep?

51
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,523
Iris?

52
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,407
Eyal

53
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,288
Menachem...

54
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,102
Fire at will.

55
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,027
You're in good shape.

56
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,997
- Thanks.
- How are you doing?

57
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,760
- What do you mean?
- Nothing special.

58
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,267
I'm glad you're okay.

59
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,873
Menachem asked
if you could stop by his office.

60
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,792
Good to see you.
You can't disappear like that.

61
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,430
So, resting? Having fun?

62
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,158
The usual.
We're starting a new operation, right?

63
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,927
You didn't go to the psychologist.

64
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,073
I won't go.
Iris had therapy forever.

65
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,906
I'm afraid they'll ground you.
You know the regulations.

66
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,945
- Fuck regulations. How is this related?
- How is this related?

67
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:47,782
- It was traumatic, so till you see one...
- I can't believe this shit.

68
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,682
Don't be so aggressive.
I'm trying to help you.

69
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,481
Go ahead, help me.

70
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,952
- Remember Alfred Himmelman?
- The Nazi you wanted to find?

71
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,755
You can put it that way.

72
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,900
- He's probably half-dead. Who cares?
- I do.

73
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,268
He wiped out all the Jews
from an entire area of Germany.

74
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,202
Hardly anyone survived except me,
your mother and a few others.

75
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,111
Himmelman lived in Argentina
all these years.

76
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,471
Some dirty deal with the government
protected him.

77
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,674
Two months ago, he disappeared.
We don't know where to.

78
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,017
- What did you have in mind?
- Himmelman has a son in Germany...

79
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,248
...whom we always kept an eye on.

80
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,451
He's not a child himself,
has two adult children.

81
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:34,188
The daughter met an Israeli
and moved to a kibbutz.

82
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,492
And a son in Berlin.

83
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:44,872
- How do I fit into the picture?
- The son is coming to visit his sister.

84
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,307
She's worried
about all the suicide bombers.

85
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,980
So she called a travel agency
to hire a tour guide, and I thought...

86
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,218
What? Take him
to the Holocaust museum?

87
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:03,625
I think if you get close to them,
we'll learn about the grandfather.

88
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,796
And I need someone
who speaks German.

89
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,461
Menachem, let's be honest here.

90
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,560
No one gives a damn anymore.

91
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,768
He'll die by himself soon enough.

92
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,840
I want to get him before God does.

93
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,679
This is a security announcement.

94
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,587
Please do not leave your luggage
unattended. Thank you.

95
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,128
Hello?

96
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,088
Where?

97
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,256
Rishon LeZiyyon?

98
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,498
Shit! How many killed?

99
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,965
Call Yaakov! What do you mean,
no answer? Call again!

100
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,173
Menachem!
He hasn't come through yet.

101
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,004
- So dial again.
- I heard about it.

102
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,702
- Galit!
- Menachem!

103
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,916
Shit, cell phones are dead.
Every time a bomb goes off...

104
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,582
Never mind,
they'll come back soon. Fuck them!

105
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,347
Twelve people killed.

106
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,655
Hi. I'm Axel.

107
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,320
This is my name here.

108
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,962
Mr. Himmelman.

109
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,896
Welcome to Israel.

110
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,798
- You just missed today's bomb.
- What?

111
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,972
We just had a bomb.
A terrorist just blew himself up.

112
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,663
- Where?
- Not far.

113
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,900
Rishon LeZiyyon.
It's a city close to here.

114
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,307
- Very close?
- Yes, but don't be afraid.

115
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,915
They never do more than one
a day. I mean, usually.

116
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,643
But maybe for you,
they will have a second one today.

117
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,719
I'm joking.

118
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,016
Okay.

119
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,628
- What?
- This music.

120
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,429
They always play sad music
after a bomb.

121
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,236
Let's hear some good music.

122
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,074
Okay.

123
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,406
I've got The Doors, the first album,
and Morrison Hotel...

124
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,516
...some Dylans, Tom Waits...

125
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:09,154
...and, of course, the Boss.

126
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,120
- You like Springsteen?
- Yeah.

127
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,521
Yeah. Why not?

128
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,925
Okay.

129
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,205
Pia! Pia!

130
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,816
Yes, that suits you. Come here!

131
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,078
Careful!

132
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,023
Come here.

133
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,919
- Hello!
- Hello!

134
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,258
Careful, you'll get all wet.

135
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,967
- You must be Eyal!
- Yes. Hello!

136
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,494
- Pia!
- I figured.

137
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,075
- Thank you.
- I just picked him up. He was scared...

138
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,335
...when he heard about the bomb.
- You speak too fast!

139
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,280
I don't speak very good Hebrew.

140
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,379
Little Hebrew. But I am learn...

141
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:46,974
Great.

142
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,611
Well, anyway, let's go.

143
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,585
- Hungry?
- Yes.

144
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,461
Totally crazy!

145
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,932
This is the "Maskeer,"
the director of the kibbutz.

146
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,626
It's my brother, Axel.

147
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,066
- Hello.
- Hello.

148
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,470
- Do you like the kibbutz food?
- Yes, I like it very much. Thank you.

149
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,940
The fish is very good.
It's from here.

150
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,377
- Your sister?
- Yes.

151
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,577
Very nice, your sister. I told her...

152
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,386
...if I not marry, I marry her.

153
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,514
- Bye.
- Bye.

154
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,963
We've got Rikudei Am tonight.

155
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,959
Oh, good for you.

156
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,330
- What's "Riku Am"?
- Rikudei Am.

157
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,233
Israeli folk dances.

158
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,805
- It's fun.
- Do you know these dances?

159
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,136
Well, I know enough about them.

160
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,212
That's why I think I'm gonna leave
you guys. See you tomorrow.

161
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,105
Oh, no, please stay with us.

162
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,978
Yes, please.

163
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,882
- You disappeared.
- No, I went to get some fresh air.

164
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,656
This is fun. You like to live here.
You can do it every week.

165
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,455
I must remember the steps
and teach them to my children.

166
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,691
Hey, maybe you can dance
with my sister now.

167
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,367
No, no. We're not allowed to dance
with customers on the first night.

168
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,134
Sorry.

169
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,110
- That was a nice evening.
- It's always good.

170
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,648
There's not much apart
from "Rikudei Am" once a week.

171
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,581
It's no Berlin here.

172
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,834
Very good.

173
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,268
- Who do you dance with usually?
- All kinds of people.

174
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,809
- No boyfriend? Nothing?
- Well...

175
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,477
How about our nice tour guide?
He's really tough.

176
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:15,142
- I'm sure he's good around the house.
- He's like my last boyfriend.

177
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,484
And? What came of it all?

178
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,601
Sometimes it's difficult.
People are very direct here.

179
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,237
They just ask you,
"Was any of your family a Nazi?"

180
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:41,543
It's interesting that when I say yes,
they look at me with pity...

181
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:46,443
...but they stay friendly. Nobody's
ever been unfriendly because of it.

182
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,916
If you accept yourself,
others will accept you too.

183
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,455
And that's where you're wrong,
little brother. You really are naive.

184
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,255
How so?

185
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,763
As soon as my boyfriend heard more
about our family, it was over.

186
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:07,267
It ruined everything. First he said
it wasrt a problem, not my fault...

187
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,474
...but he came back and told me...

188
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:14,374
...that he didn't hate Germans,
but he couldn't stop thinking about it.

189
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,878
He couldn't handle it.

190
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,849
Do you want milk and sugar?

191
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,485
I know, a splash of milk
and one sugar.

192
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,691
Right, you still remember.

193
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,991
Axel, why did you come here?

194
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,626
Don't you want to see Mother?
They really miss you.

195
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,201
- Mother asked me to ask you...
- I knew it!

196
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,402
Here, call and tell them you tried
but it didn't work.

197
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,270
Wait a moment.

198
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,044
What do you want from me?
I feel good here. It's good for me.

199
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:53,250
It's beautiful here.
But why don't you call or visit?

200
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,385
- And why did you leave home?
- I'm still in Berlin.

201
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,148
How often do you visit?
Every four months?

202
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:03,587
Pia, it's not the same.
At least we have a relationship.

203
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,389
I don't want any relationship!
You don't understand. Here.

204
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,566
You can take the checks back too.
I never cashed one.

205
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,326
Totally unnecessary.

206
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,269
Okay, okay, let's not fight.

207
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,075
I'm here to spend time with you.

208
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:22,177
And so Hansel and Gretel
kept fighting.

209
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,247
Very dramatic. What do you say?

210
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,947
You're wrong. There's something
there. You have to keep pushing.

211
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,617
- Be focused.
- I am focused. What do you want?

212
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,127
- What's going on?
- That's my question.

213
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,327
We're finished soon,
and I'll be back. Right, Menachem?

214
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,363
- When do we start training?
- No rush. Carry on with this.

215
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,870
I'll come back.

216
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:52,100
Something you're hiding from me?
No problem. I'll go.

217
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:53,845
Relax.

218
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,393
- Good morning to you.
- Good morning.

219
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,855
Good morning.

220
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,891
Why don't you join us.

221
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:15,760
Well...

222
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,692
Maybe I can use an egg.

223
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,668
So where are you going?

224
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,140
- You're not coming with us?
- No, I have to work.

225
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,608
I'll join you on the weekend.

226
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,407
Do you have a nice plan for today?

227
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,585
Well, we have many options.

228
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,778
We can go see
Christian holy places...

229
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,787
...or places mentioned in the Bible,
whatever Axel wants.

230
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,789
There are so many places
I wanna see.

231
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,484
Haifa is beautiful, isn't it?

232
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,392
And I also wanna see
the Sea of Galilee, Kinneret.

233
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,293
Kinneret.

234
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,433
You seem to know the country
pretty well.

235
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,365
I've always been interested in Israel.

236
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,632
I also wanna see Palestinian cities.
Can we go to the West Bank?

237
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,333
It's the other direction.
Why do you want to go there?

238
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,136
Why not?

239
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,041
I brought a few of my CDs.

240
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,645
Be my guest.

241
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,597
Let me see what else
you've got there.

242
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,336
Many woman singers.

243
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,374
- Only women.
- Why?

244
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,976
I like female singers.

245
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,703
When a man sings, I feel like...

246
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,680
...there's something missing.
- Really? That's strange.

247
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,779
- Who is this?
- Gigliola Cinquetti.

248
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,480
She's Italian.

249
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,051
Fits in perfectly with the scenery,
don't you think?

250
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,968
So how many children
do you have?

251
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,746
- I don't have any children.
- But you said something about...

252
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,713
...teaching your children to dance.
- No, I meant the children that I teach.

253
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,283
I work for this organization.

254
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,922
We help children of immigrants
from Turkey and other places.

255
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,489
We help them with their homework.
We read with them...

256
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,455
There's not much money
with that work.

257
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,458
My God, you just sound
like my parents.

258
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,460
Why? What do they think?

259
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,964
My father owns this big factory,
and he wants me to work there.

260
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,035
- I see.
- He always expected us...

261
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:36,696
...to join the family business one day.
But then Pia left...

262
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:40,469
...and I just told them I'd rather do
something useful with my life.

263
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,729
So tell me more about your family.

264
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:04,299
Well, there's not so much to tell.
It's only my parents and Pia.

265
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,132
- No grandparents?
- No. They died a long time ago.

266
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,235
- Do you have any?
- What, grandparents?

267
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,705
- Yeah.
- No.

268
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:16,505
Actually, even my mother died
a few years ago, and my father.

269
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,843
- He died when I was in high school.
- Oh, I see.

270
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,845
- Do you have any children?
- No.

271
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,714
- I'm not going to have any.
- Why not?

272
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,283
Forget it. You don't have to hear
my pessimistic view of the world.

273
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,624
Hi, Pia.

274
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,524
No, no, no.
We're already in the North, why?

275
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,293
Oh, I see.

276
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,299
You wanna talk to him?

277
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:38,799
Okay, okay. Bye.

278
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,234
They had a bomb in Haifa,
very close to where we passed.

279
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,668
What happened?

280
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,276
Another one of those fucking terrorists
exploded. Four people died.

281
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,446
Shit.

282
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:50,946
It's terrible.

283
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,517
Did you ever think why these people
are doing this? I mean...

284
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,712
...how desperate they must be
to go out and kill themselves?

285
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,085
What's to think? They're animals.

286
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,818
There's a lot to think.
They have mothers and children.

287
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,123
So why do they come and kill
innocent mothers and children here?

288
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,897
There's nothing to think about.

289
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,099
He says his grandfather is dead.
I'm stuck with this pseudo liberal...

290
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,003
...who talks about suicide bombers'
motives. I almost punched him.

291
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,211
Calm down.

292
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:22,679
What did he say
about his grandfather?

293
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,041
- He doesn't have one.
- Find out more.

294
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,582
Maybe he doesn't know. Maybe...

295
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,846
Maybe he thinks he's Dolly
the clone-sheep and never had one.

296
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,617
Stop acting like a child.
Maybe you do need a therapist.

297
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,126
I don't need to host
a patronizing German peacenik...

298
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,797
...for the Foreign Ministry.

299
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,490
Why are you getting so uptight?
It's not like you.

300
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,503
Relax, have some fun.

301
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,432
And if you happen
to learn something...

302
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,474
- Whatever. I've got to go now.
- Call me later.

303
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,079
The Sea of Galilee.

304
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,327
So this is where it all happened.

305
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,316
Hey, Jesus, they lied to you.

306
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,844
It's impossible to walk on water.

307
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,683
Bravo.

308
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,414
You did it.

309
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,826
You don't understand. You can't just
come to the Sea of Galilee...

310
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,192
...and start walking on water.

311
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,398
If you could,
everybody would be doing it.

312
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,029
You need to prepare yourself.

313
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,070
And how would you do that?

314
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,536
- Please enlighten me.
- Well...

315
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,537
...you need to completely
purify yourself.

316
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,808
Your heart needs to be like
it's clean from the inside...

317
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,286
...no negativity, no bad thoughts.

318
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,955
And then?

319
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:48,751
And then you can walk on water.
I'm sure of it.

320
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:37,868
Where did you go?

321
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,703
- I just went to get something.
- What?

322
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,401
We gotta do
"Cinderella Rockefella."

323
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,410
- Rubbish, you're crazy.
- Why not?

324
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,843
What are you talking about?

325
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,950
- My little brother is drunk.
- I didn't drink anything.

326
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,246
You remember the song
"Cinderella Rockefella"?

327
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,618
- Cinderella who?
- Do you remember Esther Ofarim?

328
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,587
Ofarim. Yes, I know the name.

329
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,558
- How do you know of her?
- She and her husband, the Ofarims...

330
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,628
...they were huge
in Germany in the '60s.

331
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,858
- My aunt was a great fan of hers.
- She taught us that song.

332
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,195
Axel and I used to sing it
at family parties.

333
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,497
We used to get dressed up
as prince and princess.

334
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,079
Thanks! Thanks a lot!

335
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,446
Thank you, Tom.
And now we have a surprise.

336
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,222
Our Pia and her brother Axel.

337
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,327
Go for it, Pia!

338
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,601
...first to the right...
- No, no, first with the left foot...

339
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,406
Yes, left foot forward, turn right,
then a double side-step...

340
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:02,183
You do it great. Come to Berlin.
We'll do it at Father's party...

341
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,582
No way. You're out of your mind.

342
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:35,235
They said something about a party,
but with no details.

343
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,345
Forget it, Menachem.
They'll be here any minute.

344
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,747
I'm taking him to the Dead Sea.
Via the Jordan Valley.

345
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,187
During the day, it's safe, don't worry.

346
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,692
I'll show him Jericho.
He wants to see Palestinians.

347
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,923
He's such a nudnik.
I won't stop in Jericho, don't worry.

348
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:57,193
I might drown him in the Dead Sea.
Might be a world news scoop.

349
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,627
Okay, Menachem.
They're here, I gotta go. Bye!

350
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,806
- Hi.
- Good morning. Morning.

351
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,032
Make sure my brother
puts on suntan lotion.

352
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,268
He always gets sunburned
really fast.

353
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,174
Two hours on the desert,
he'll be red like a tomato.

354
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:13,114
No problem. It's part of the service.

355
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,632
So tell me.

356
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,827
- Does she like living here?
- Yes, she loves it.

357
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,832
Does she have a boyfriend?

358
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,634
She had one, but not anymore.

359
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,671
A guy she met in India.

360
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,948
- She says Israeli men are...
- What?

361
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,281
- Impossible?
- Yes.

362
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,850
I mean, no.

363
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,078
It's okay.
She's not the first to think so.

364
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,159
Is it true that Israeli men
don't talk about their feelings?

365
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,587
I don't know.

366
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,728
I really don't like to talk about it.

367
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,428
So are you in a relationship?

368
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,006
I'm not so great
in relationships, I think.

369
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,435
Do you know anyone
who's good at relationships?

370
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,107
I guess you're right.

371
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,707
How can you ever know
what a woman is really thinking?

372
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,010
They always complain
that you never listen.

373
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:26,622
"You're not connected
to your emotions. You never cry."

374
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,223
Just never know when they're serious,
when they really mean it.

375
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,056
What do you mean?

376
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,832
For many years, I was involved
with a woman, Iris.

377
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,067
That's it.

378
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,600
Now I'm on my own.

379
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,343
Come on, let's take this stuff off.

380
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,356
It's an Arabic word.
It means "come on."

381
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,998
You don't have to walk on water here.
You can float on them instead.

382
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,115
- You really never cry?
- Never.

383
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,378
Not even when you see a sad movie
or hear a sad song?

384
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,522
It's okay, I have a good excuse.

385
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,657
When I was 15,
the doctors discovered...

386
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,383
...I have a rare eye problem.

387
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:40,529
My tear ducts are dry,
so I can't cry even if I want to.

388
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,492
- Oh, shit, your sister's gonna kill me.
- What?

389
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,927
You're really burnt.

390
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:21,403
Okay, put some on your arms.

391
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,196
I'll do your back.

392
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,308
So they didn't circumcise you?

393
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,176
I think I never saw one.

394
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,815
You know, we used to talk
about it in the army.

395
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,076
If it looks bigger
and if it's better in bed.

396
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,914
I don't know,
it's the only one I ever had.

397
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,248
Is everybody like that in Europe?

398
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,395
In Germany hardly nobody
is circumcised, except for the Turks.

399
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,895
In other countries of Europe?
Let me think.

400
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,036
Italians?
Definitely not circumcised.

401
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:57,037
Also, the English and the French,
definitely not.

402
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,604
Only the Muslims
are circumcised in Europe...

403
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,303
...and the Jews, of course.
I think it looks better circumcised.

404
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,616
I see you know quite a lot about it.

405
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,734
Thank you.

406
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,237
It's so freezing out here.

407
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,576
No, don't move away.

408
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:38,074
The only way to keep warm
is to sit close to each other.

409
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,978
Every Israeli soldier knows this.

410
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,812
So how often does your sister
visit you?

411
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,116
- She doesn't.
- Why not?

412
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,886
She doesn't get along
with my parents.

413
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,396
I actually came here
to try to bring her back...

414
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,998
...to my father's birthday party.
- Birthday party?

415
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:01,228
Yes, my father's going to be 70,
and we're organizing a party for him.

416
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,135
My mother thought it would be
a great surprise if Pia came.

417
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,639
Sounds nice.

418
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,840
Yes. It's going to be
a big thing with lots of guests.

419
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:13,915
You know, my parents live
in this villa next to Wannsee.

420
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,313
That's where the party's
going to be.

421
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:21,147
But Pia, she doesn't even
wanna talk about it.

422
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,427
- Can I ask you something personal?
- Of course.

423
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,831
I've got nothing to hide. Go ahead.

424
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,667
I've always wondered what it was like
to grow up in Germany...

425
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,969
...and then suddenly realize...

426
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,738
...what happened in World War II.

427
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,150
Well, that's not such an easy one.

428
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,252
- Was your family in the...?
- You're changing the subject.

429
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,547
Okay, I'm sorry.

430
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:58,695
To tell you the truth, it's something
we almost never talk about.

431
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,490
My friends, they feel like
it's something from the past.

432
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,860
They feel like it's something...

433
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,434
...we don't have anything to do with.

434
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:09,367
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

435
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,700
It actually feels right
to talk about it...

436
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,774
...especially in Israel.

437
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:22,708
It's just that whenever I try
to talk about it, I...

438
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,449
I don't know, I never find
the right words. I feel...

439
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,452
I don't know...

440
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,524
...stupid.

441
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,239
This is an interesting way
to put out a campfire.

442
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,635
It's the best way.

443
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,504
They teach it to you
in the Boy Scouts.

444
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,643
I told you, you haven't been
drinking enough water.

445
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,616
Didrt listen.

446
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,218
That was beautiful.

447
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,760
Thank you.

448
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,656
You're very welcome.

449
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,536
Here, listen.

450
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,173
That's an Israeli female singer
for you.

451
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:24,809
What's the song about?

452
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,845
It's a love song, you know.

453
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,211
But what are the words?

454
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,889
Can you translate?

455
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,255
Guess I can try.

456
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,962
"The two of us are riding in a car.

457
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,397
You tell me it will be a long ride.

458
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,668
That I can fall asleep.

459
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,079
Later, you tell me
everything that happened.

460
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,713
I'm not sleeping.

461
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:02,882
I'm...

462
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,747
...counting stars
through holes in the blanket.

463
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,654
And you with a cigarette
in your mouth...

464
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,228
...singing along with the radio.

465
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,657
A love song.

466
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,131
Kiss me strong.

467
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,796
Kiss me until it hurts."

468
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,840
That's it, more or less.

469
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,277
It goes on like that.

470
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,427
Fire at will.

471
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,420
Shit!

472
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,221
What's up? You're working hard, eh?

473
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,555
- Too many female singers.
- What?

474
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,193
Nothing. I'm just...

475
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:24,133
You're not... Do you have to
report this? Could you just...?

476
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:28,465
It's okay. There's nothing wrong.
It's not that bad. Go home.

477
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,401
Have a nice weekend.

478
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,604
- Rest. Don't worry.
- Look, it's a problem.

479
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:39,711
The guy's in complete denial.
He's been through a trauma.

480
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,784
It might be risky to send him
on such a complicated job.

481
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:46,889
Are you saying that
just so you can keep him?

482
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,685
I'll be done with him in two days.
It's fine with me. You know what?

483
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:53,920
Check his results from today's
practice. I bet he wasrt good.

484
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,098
I don't know.

485
00:43:55,299 --> 00:44:00,498
I can't give him up. He did a terrific
job with Abu lbraim. I need him.

486
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,499
I can insist he sees Rudy.

487
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:07,837
I'll convince him he's not just
any shrink but the chief counselor.

488
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,614
Am I interrupting?

489
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,215
No. Just asking when
you'll be done with this bullshit.

490
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,819
Just a couple of days more.
Menachem, we need to talk.

491
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:21,116
Just a second.
Let me finish with Jello. Take this.

492
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,190
Check the extra material
on Himmelman.

493
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,761
Extra material? I told you he's dead.
What do you want?

494
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,124
Sorry.

495
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:34,761
Too much desert.

496
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:39,138
I'll be sitting outside, reading.
Take your time.

497
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,025
You look different today.

498
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,457
- Different?
- Yes.

499
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:03,558
- I don't know, your hair looks...
- You said we're going...

500
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,703
...to a fancy restaurant in Tel Aviv,
so I put on some lipstick.

501
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,164
- It's nice.
- Thank you.

502
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,651
Can I offer you dessert?

503
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:25,182
We have hot chocolate souffle
with ice cream.

504
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,016
We have creme brulee.

505
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,192
We'll wait till my brother
comes back.

506
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,923
Okay, I'll give you a few minutes.

507
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:40,662
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

508
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,840
Do you know where there's
a nice party held tonight?

509
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,865
A good one, but you have to be
a very good dancer.

510
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:48,969
He's very friendly, your brother.

511
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:53,849
Yes, he is.

512
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,486
I have the address
to the best party in town.

513
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,321
It's a place called TLV.

514
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,697
Don't look at me.
I know nothing about these things.

515
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,325
I mean, nothing.

516
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,989
- Are you sure this is the right place?
- Yeah. Looks great, doesn't it?

517
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,734
You want a drink?

518
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,704
- Yes.
- Beer, please.

519
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,186
- What can I get you, sweetie?
- "Sweetie"?

520
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,586
- Okay, then, not sweetie.
- Three Heinekens.

521
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,795
I'm going over for a sec.

522
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,535
Thanks.

523
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,232
- Let's go dance.
- No, no.

524
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,105
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

525
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,311
You go dance. I'm okay.

526
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,073
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

527
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,049
Do you mind?

528
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,344
- I'm going.
- Why?

529
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:46,488
I just have to go.
Pick you up tomorrow at the hotel.

530
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,969
Morning.

531
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,543
Did you sleep well?

532
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,647
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Good morning.

533
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,612
Is it okay if Rafik
takes a ride with us to Jerusalem?

534
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,789
- He lives in... What's it called?
- Bayt Jala.

535
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,184
Bayt Jala.

536
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,958
An Arab?!

537
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,355
Whatever.

538
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,927
You're paying.

539
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,698
This is where the border
used to be...

540
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,877
...until we took over
East Jerusalem in '67.

541
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:44,137
Arab snipers were sitting
on top of these walls.

542
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:48,514
If they had a bad day, they would shoot
the Jews walking on the other side.

543
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,183
I think we should get off here.

544
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,251
- Can you please let us off?
- Why?

545
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,361
Rafik is taking me
to his uncle's shop.

546
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:33,862
This is the Wall.

547
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,793
Maybe you'd like to put a note there.

548
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,058
The religious believe
God reads them.

549
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:41,395
- You've no reason to be upset.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

550
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,998
The main thing is that he found
someone to take him shopping.

551
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,176
Isn't that why he came to Israel?

552
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,574
It's so strange. He always liked
to flaunt it back in high school...

553
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,579
...in front of our parents' friends.
It was the first thing...

554
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:56,617
...that he'd say, "Ich bin schwul."
"I'm gay" in German.

555
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:58,718
But he didn't say a word to me.

556
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,355
Neither did you.

557
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,689
But it really doesn't matter anymore.

558
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,458
Maybe you frightened him,
said something that...

559
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:08,222
- So now it's my fault?
- No, it's not a question of fault.

560
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:11,492
I really don't wanna talk about it.
Let's talk about you, okay?

561
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,896
Why won't you go
to your father's birthday party?

562
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,298
He told you about that?

563
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:18,434
- Is it a secret?
- It's not. I just don't wanna go.

564
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,836
Why not?

565
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,568
I don't want to go back.
I don't want to see them again.

566
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,041
But they're your parents.

567
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,442
Are you taking sides on this now?

568
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,085
This is the womars section.

569
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,215
Do you want to put a note?

570
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,192
Oh, here's Axel.

571
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:42,495
- Hey.
- Look at this. I wanted one for years.

572
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,298
- How much did you pay?
- Hundred euro.

573
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,470
- Rafik got him to lower the price.
- Give me the jacket.

574
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,562
- What is it?
- I'll speak to him.

575
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:51,841
Stay out of this!

576
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,440
- What are you doing?
- Let me handle this.

577
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,204
It's all right. He would've paid
twice as much in Berlin.

578
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,609
- It's principle.
- What principle? He's satisfied.

579
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,785
- He doesn't feel he's been ripped off.
- Stay out of this, okay?

580
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,419
Give back the money!

581
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,220
One hundred?
You should be ashamed.

582
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,850
You won't get a better price.
I promise.

583
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:18,926
It's enough, great.

584
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,469
Here. One hundred. Take back 20.
You get it for 80.

585
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:26,032
You're trying to cheat?
Give me the money.

586
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,911
20, 40, 60, 80...

587
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,473
That's it.

588
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,611
Only 20? What are you thinking?

589
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,260
- You didn't have to do that.
- Why not?

590
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,862
- I told you, it's a good price for Axel.
- So what?

591
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,055
So it wasrt too much money for me.

592
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,929
- I feel so bad for those shopkeepers.
- Oh, poor Palestinian shopkeepers.

593
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,496
I forgot you Germans
are so sensitive.

594
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,264
Human misery
always touched your hearts.

595
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,739
- What did you say?
- Nothing, forget it.

596
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,740
I will go now.

597
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,083
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

598
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,813
It's not your fault.

599
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,858
It was very nice to meet you.

600
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:17,923
Take care.

601
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,429
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

602
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,538
- Stay in touch.
- We will.

603
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,885
- Can I say one sentence?
- Go ahead.

604
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,865
You Jews are so obsessed with
what was done to you in the past.

605
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,301
Maybe if you let go...

606
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,631
...you'd be able to see...
- That's already three sentences.

607
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:10,507
- Okay. Thanks for the ride.
- You're welcome.

608
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,782
This is all that's left
of a full public bus...

609
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:50,419
...after another suicide bomber
blew himself up.

610
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,617
The terrorist, driving a 4x 4 SUV,
stopped behind the bus...

611
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:59,284
...while it was picking up
passengers at this station...

612
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,164
- The atmosphere here is pretty grim.
- Yes.

613
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,360
You've never thought
of coming home?

614
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,038
You want to ruin our last evening?

615
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,404
- They're your parents, damn it!
- You know nothing about them.

616
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:17,239
- Then tell me something.
- I don't want to. It'd do no good.

617
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:21,273
If there's something I should know,
then please tell me, okay?

618
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,880
You really don't know, do you?

619
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,881
All the hours
Father spent alone in his room?

620
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,417
The long-distance calls
in the night?

621
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,929
- What do you mean?
- His "stock market" calls?

622
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,092
Once, I picked up the phone
and heard...

623
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:41,770
...that our grandfather
was still alive.

624
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:46,800
That they'd helped him escape
and hide for years.

625
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,945
- He's alive?
- He was when I left.

626
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:56,978
I can't believe it. They said
he died towards the end of the war.

627
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,747
They said a lot of things.
I was so mad.

628
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:03,289
I screamed at them.
I insisted that we turn him in.

629
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:07,260
- Do you think he's still alive?
- I don't know.

630
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,163
I moved out the same day.

631
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,928
Father was afraid
I'd go to the police. It was terrible.

632
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,375
I don't understand.
Why didn't you tell me?

633
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,705
You'd just gone to Italy.

634
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,444
You were in love.
I didn't want to ruin it.

635
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:31,552
I was back two weeks later!

636
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,451
I know.

637
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,484
I'm sorry.

638
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,160
I couldn't handle it.

639
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,340
See you. Take care of yourself.

640
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,675
We have to get going.

641
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,765
Well, you've got
my phone number...

642
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,190
...if you're in the area sometime.

643
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,869
Okay, thanks.

644
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:32,743
It's 102 FM Radio Tel Aviv...

645
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,977
...and as usual
we play you soft music...

646
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:39,453
...the morning
after a suicide bombing.

647
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,683
Thank you so much for everything.
I had a very interesting vacation.

648
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,823
My pleasure.

649
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,489
This is my address in Berlin.

650
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,855
You're more than welcome
if you're ever around.

651
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:23,089
Thank you, but to tell you the truth...

652
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:27,099
...l've never been to Germany,
and I don't think I'll ever want to go.

653
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,669
Well, if you change your mind.

654
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,118
You tell him.
I feel wrong about it anyway.

655
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,192
No problem.
It should come from me.

656
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,921
I'll keep him busy
with Himmelman.

657
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:59,632
How long
will this Nazi shit continue?

658
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,963
Isn't this thing getting
too expensive?

659
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,629
Don't worry, I talked to the boss.
Your ass is covered, I...

660
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,142
Hello, Eyal. Did he catch his plane?

661
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:12,439
Yes, he's gone.
Could've told me he's homo.

662
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:15,174
- Why does it matter?
- Did you spend two weeks with him?

663
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,354
- A real "homo" homo?
- No, a half-homo.

664
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,388
Did he have wandering hands?
He try to touch you?

665
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:25,820
- I take it you really had fun.
- I'm not amused at all.

666
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:30,022
Here's your last disc. I didn't even
listen to it. I'm done with this.

667
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,724
I'm ready for the new operation.

668
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,007
Okay, I'll leave you alone.

669
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,511
I can't believe
you got me mixed up with this crap.

670
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:49,885
Touring around with...
I mean, I've got nothing against him...

671
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:53,078
...but everyone's started training.
I missed three days already.

672
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,325
Listen! They decided you're not...

673
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,891
I told you... I warned you.

674
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,596
- What?
- I'm sorry.

675
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,894
I tried. I told them you were
really good with the Germans.

676
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:11,039
- That you are in great shape.
- Fuck! Those mother...!

677
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,401
Who do they think they are?

678
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,942
I started this mission,
and I'm supposed to finish it!

679
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:19,277
What other agent
would do such a clean job?

680
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:23,018
- I... Forget it.
- Don't take it so bad.

681
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:26,313
- There will be other operations...
- I've had enough of you!

682
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:29,719
Enough of you
and of your stupid Nazi games!

683
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,129
- Hello.
- Hello.

684
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,173
Menachem asked me to deliver this.

685
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:28,313
- He wants you to listen to this.
- Thanks, I...

686
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:32,011
- Do you need it back?
- No.

687
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:36,021
- I... If I'm not needed, I'll just leave.
- Thanks.

688
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:59,504
Once, I picked up the phone
and heard...

689
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,980
...that our grandfather
was still alive.

690
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:06,178
That they had helped him
to escape and hide for years.

691
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,847
- He's alive?
- He was when I left.

692
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:14,886
I can't believe it. They said
he died towards the end of the war.

693
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:18,067
They said a lot of things.
I was so mad.

694
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:21,703
I screamed at them.
I insisted that we turn him in.

695
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,101
- Do you think he's still alive?
- I don't know.

696
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:28,001
I moved out the same day.

697
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:32,336
Father was afraid
I'd go to the police. It was terrible.

698
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,696
Good day.

699
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:57,306
Thank you.

700
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,251
Thank you.

701
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:18,851
Please do not leave
your baggage unattended.

702
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:23,829
Radio One!

703
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,959
For adults only.

704
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:32,402
I'm Knut Elstermann! Let's start
the day with a cool oldie. I hope...

705
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:36,567
...that you all are well and that you
have a nice and a peaceful day.

706
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,172
Here's Buffalo Springfield
with "For What It's Worth."

707
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:41,166
What are you doing here?

708
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,968
I wanted to surprise you.

709
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,198
Well, you did.

710
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,519
- Thank you.
- I really love hot dogs.

711
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,626
This is not a hot dog.
It's a currywurst.

712
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:07,929
- Currywurst?
- Currywurst.

713
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:20,230
- It's really nice here in Berlin.
- Well, what did you expect?

714
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,637
I don't know.

715
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:26,010
The truth is I was...

716
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,777
I was afraid you wouldn't be
happy to see me.

717
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,911
No, you don't understand, l...

718
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:36,685
I... But I can explain to you.

719
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,427
I was in a very delicate situation
when I came to Israel.

720
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:43,258
Delicate?

721
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:47,095
- Remember I told you about Iris?
- Your girlfriend?

722
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:51,403
Well, the truth is she was my wife.

723
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:54,334
We were married for a few years...

724
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:58,872
...and about a month before you came
to Israel, she suddenly...

725
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:01,046
She left.

726
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:05,177
And we don't have tourists now,
and there's not much work, so I...

727
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,918
You see, after you left,
I really felt that...

728
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:13,961
I didn't want you to think
that just because... You know.

729
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,290
So I bought a ticket and...

730
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,890
It's okay.

731
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:21,968
Eat your currywurst.
It will get cold.

732
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,241
Before I forget.

733
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:39,079
I don't believe it. Folk dancing.

734
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,756
Thank you. It's very nice.

735
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:45,188
You have no idea how nice.
Do you know how humiliating...

736
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,158
...it was to walk into Tower Records
and ask for this music?

737
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:51,128
You should have seen the guy there,
how he looked at me.

738
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:06,013
- Can I have two beers, please?
- What kind of beer?

739
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:08,513
- You have Heineken?
- Sure.

740
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:15,114
So where are you from?

741
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,785
Israel.

742
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:25,091
- Something to eat?
- We just gorged on currywurst.

743
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:27,764
- Oh, gourmets!
- Yes.

744
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:33,299
Well, maybe he doesn't like Israel,
but I think he likes you.

745
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:35,306
Really? I wouldn't know.

746
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:36,773
I'm not into German guys.

747
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,672
- What do you mean?
- I've never been with a German guy.

748
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:44,080
- What?
- I've been with Italians, English...

749
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:48,723
...French, Turks, the Palestinian,
but never with a German guy.

750
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,554
You have any idea why?

751
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,127
Not really.
It just worked out that way.

752
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:57,832
I guess it's less complicated.

753
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:02,664
I always thought you people were
more easygoing about these matters.

754
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:05,732
- Who? Germans?
- No.

755
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,873
- You know...
- Homos?

756
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,672
Yes.

757
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,474
I thought it's more easy,
like with the Arab.

758
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:16,446
- You met, and right away...
- Rafik?

759
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,587
I'm not sure if that's true
in his case, but, yes...

760
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,017
...sometimes it's very fast.

761
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:23,486
Why?

762
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,054
- Are you jealous?
- No.

763
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:31,123
- But it could be fun sometimes, no?
- What?

764
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,693
Being able to see someone you like
and just go straight to bed...

765
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:38,203
...not having to talk much.
- Yeah, that can be nice.

766
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:43,769
And... And when that happens...

767
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:48,009
...how does it work out? I mean...

768
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:52,715
...how do you know...?
- Oh, you straight men.

769
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,353
- What?
- You're all the same.

770
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,954
The only thing you want to know
is who does the schnooky-schnooky.

771
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:00,822
Oh, really?

772
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:04,933
No, I mean...
Well, it's interesting.

773
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,866
You, for example.

774
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:10,699
What do you...?

775
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,933
If you really need to know,
I like it both ways.

776
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:20,138
After all, how many options are there?
It would be stupid to limit yourself.

777
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:23,681
But...

778
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,781
...doesn't it hurt?

779
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,589
No, not really.

780
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,386
You have to relax your tushy,
and then it can feel pretty good.

781
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,587
The feeling of someone
entering your body...

782
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:38,732
...the feeling of a...

783
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,164
Maybe that's enough
for the first time, huh?

784
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:51,105
So how is your Arab friend?

785
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,148
Much better after I sent him
another 100 euro...

786
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,818
...to give his uncle
for that stupid jacket.

787
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,718
- Axel!
- Surprise!

788
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,023
Hi, sugar.

789
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:39,826
- Hello! Who's this hottie?
- He looks yummy!

790
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,259
Oh, you're cute.

791
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,728
He's a friend from Israel.

792
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:46,927
How do you do?

793
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,773
How's the party at "Roses" today?

794
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:56,242
- Good, as always.
- All right, first I need a drink.

795
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,777
I feel like something else.

796
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,741
Pull yourselves together, girls!

797
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:03,712
Bye!

798
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:13,626
- They thought you were cute.
- Should I be flattered?

799
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,626
Don't get upset.
They're really okay.

800
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,992
Some of them even volunteer
in our organization.

801
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,363
Don't patronize. Remember,
we invented Dana International.

802
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:16,685
You okay?

803
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,523
Eyal!

804
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,625
Fuck off, asshole,
or I'll blow your brains out!

805
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,493
- You speak German.
- Not really.

806
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,892
- But you just spoke perfectly.
- My parents spoke German.

807
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,293
What?

808
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,263
My mother was born in Berlin.

809
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:03,300
She lived there until they had
to move and hide.

810
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,701
That's how I grew up.
No German products in the house...

811
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:12,437
...no traveling to Germany,
never talking about it.

812
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:15,412
When they were alone
and didn't think I was listening...

813
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,278
...they'd speak German.

814
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,448
Is that why you brought the gun?

815
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:24,683
I don't know. Just before I left
for the airport, I got scared.

816
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:27,919
I didn't really think it over.
I just took it.

817
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,502
It's too bad you didn't kill him.

818
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:36,131
What?

819
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:37,429
Too bad you didn't kill...

820
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,072
...that piece of shit!

821
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:42,899
Those people pollute the world.
They turn everything into shit.

822
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:49,544
You know what?

823
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:53,548
As long as you are here, why don't you
come to my parents' kibbutz.

824
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:56,053
- Their what?
- Their villa.

825
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:57,885
I told you about it, remember?

826
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,526
My father's birthday party
is this weekend.

827
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:02,756
Come instead of Pia.

828
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:04,831
I'd be happy to.

829
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,282
You know,
I almost bought you this CD.

830
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:24,314
I bought it at the airport
on the way home.

831
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:27,919
I bought so many Hebrew CDs.

832
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,886
Only female singers, I hope.

833
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:44,569
Let's stop here for coffee.

834
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:56,478
Thanks.

835
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,619
That was the first highway
in Germany.

836
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,653
In the '20s, they had car races here.

837
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:06,761
Do you see those seats over there?

838
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,924
That's where the important people
watched the races...

839
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:13,658
...all the politicians, aristocrats.

840
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:16,269
And then Hitler and his people.

841
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,140
Yes, he was sitting there too.

842
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,012
You know,
when we were in high school...

843
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:29,547
...a group of students went
to Germany...

844
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,582
...as a part of
an exchange program.

845
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:34,347
So there were all kinds
of stories about...

846
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:37,992
...how the German girls
were easy and, you know...

847
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,223
But there was one thing
I couldn't get out of my head.

848
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,398
My friends figured out...

849
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,295
...that anyone they saw
who was over 60 years old...

850
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:49,834
...was a grown-up during the war
and probably participated in it.

851
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,001
So they made up this game...

852
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:55,142
...where they walked up
to all the people in the street...

853
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:56,971
...and asked them in Hebrew:

854
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,906
"Where were you when my family
was burned at the camps?"

855
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:04,079
And they started laughing and,
you know...

856
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:07,446
Do you wanna play
this game here?

857
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:09,123
It did cross my mind.

858
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:12,827
But I figure that
only people over 80, 85...

859
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:16,691
...could've been in the army then.
Very few are still alive.

860
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:19,662
Don't be a sissy. Give it a try.

861
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:25,370
How old would you say this man is?

862
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,178
What is it?

863
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:35,714
You won't believe this,
but I know this man.

864
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:38,249
He's a friend of my parents.

865
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:41,656
Incredible.

866
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:44,692
- Hello.
- Hello.

867
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:46,224
What are you doing here?

868
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:48,555
- Watching over you.
- I don't understand.

869
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:50,732
Calm down.
Introduce me, then I'll go.

870
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,957
I'm staying here. Room 223.

871
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:57,233
This is Menachem,
a friend of my mother.

872
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,071
This is Axel.

873
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,468
- A pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

874
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,942
It's always nice to run into
somebody you know just like this.

875
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,841
- Will you join us?
- No, no, thank you. I'm on my way.

876
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:12,885
I just ate a little sandwich.
Well, it was nice bumping into you.

877
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,350
Bye.

878
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:26,531
- Small world, isn't it?
- Yes, this always happens to me.

879
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:34,301
This is an Esther Ofarim song
I really like.

880
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:44,212
I guess I don't have to translate, huh?

881
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:52,749
Here it is.

882
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:12,105
Axel, nice to have you here.

883
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:14,475
- Hi!
- Come on, give me that.

884
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,044
Okay.

885
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:17,318
That too.

886
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:18,486
No, it's okay.

887
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:19,813
Yes, yes.

888
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,648
There's no way out.

889
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,348
This is Helga. She took care of me
since I was little.

890
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:25,958
Helga, this is Eyal.

891
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:27,128
Welcome.

892
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:30,196
I hope you're taking
very good care of our Axel.

893
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,958
- Well, someone's gotta do it.
- Yeah.

894
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,796
Then come to the kitchen.
I made cheesecake.

895
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,304
Okay.

896
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:45,513
Come, let's say hello to my mother.

897
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,084
Mama.

898
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,414
Axel.

899
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,058
My dear.

900
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,453
This is my mother.

901
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:02,291
- Nice to meet you. I'm Segret.
- I'm Eyal. Nice to meet you too.

902
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,965
- Eyal, that's...
- It's an Israeli name.

903
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,092
Oh, I see. That's nice.

904
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,530
So you live here?

905
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:11,103
No. It's my first time to Germany.

906
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:12,800
Welcome, then.

907
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,038
I hope you have a good time.

908
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,341
Excuse me.
There's so much to do.

909
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:20,378
Ah, Axel, please...

910
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:24,882
...be punctual this evening.
We start at 8:00. On the dot.

911
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,032
- You look...
- What?

912
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,370
Very German.

913
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:22,867
Thank you. You look good too.

914
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:26,104
You think this jacket
is good enough?

915
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:28,509
Sure. Come on.

916
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:50,398
- Nice to see you, my son.
- Nice to see you, Father.

917
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:53,005
- And where is your sister?
- She couldn't make it.

918
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,839
Does she want
to stay on that kibbutz forever?

919
01:21:57,379 --> 01:22:00,576
Let's not talk about it.
Today is your birthday, Father.

920
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:02,639
This is my friend Eyal.

921
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:04,842
A pleasure.

922
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:16,430
Oh, Axel!

923
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,825
- Nice to see you!
- Hello.

924
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:23,433
Did you prepare something
for your father?

925
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:26,340
Of course, Uncle Gustav.

926
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:32,373
May I have your attention, please?

927
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:37,280
I thought long and hard about what
I should bring to Father's birthday...

928
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:39,612
...something fun
with positive energy.

929
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:44,954
I thought I'd teach you all a dance
that I learned recently.

930
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:49,085
I promise you it's very easy,
and you'll all enjoy it.

931
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:54,565
So... Form a circle and do what I do.
It's really very easy.

932
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:57,127
So... You, come.

933
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,471
Okay, Aunt Frieda is there.
All right...

934
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:08,315
- Not you?
- No, I have to organize something.

935
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:12,349
And start with the right.

936
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:49,914
You must. Come on.

937
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:00,597
And again.

938
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:22,050
And... That's it!

939
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:24,358
Great!

940
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:42,172
Thank you, son.
You managed to surprise me.

941
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:49,439
We wish him all the best

942
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:52,343
Three cheers for him

943
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:57,919
We wish him all the best

944
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:00,955
Three cheers for him

945
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:05,497
Hip, hip, hurrah!

946
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:36,019
I'm very happy
to be with my family again.

947
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:38,399
And...

948
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,630
...in my homeland.

949
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:47,975
Father!

950
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,183
Blow the candles out.

951
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:37,258
Axel!

952
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:41,625
You cannot imagine
how happy, how overjoyed I am...

953
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:44,354
...that my father
and my son are with me today.

954
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:51,298
This is Axel, my son.
You don't know him.

955
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:12,318
Mother!

956
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:16,795
Is that why you sent me to Israel?
To bring Pia for this?

957
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:22,734
It all happened in the last few days.
I never thought we'd get him here.

958
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:26,507
Congratulations. Had I known,
I never would have come.

959
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:31,137
Don't talk to me like that. Can't you
see how happy your father is?

960
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:35,043
Sure. It's a pity the old man
didn't give a political speech.

961
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,219
What kind of a tone is that?
From you?

962
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,011
You always make things difficult.

963
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:43,046
Why did you have to bring
that Israeli?

964
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:46,749
As though all you do
is meant to cause us trouble.

965
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:48,590
You really think so?

966
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,496
As if we hadrt had enough trouble.

967
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:55,829
All the years they watched us,
like criminals...

968
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:58,737
...to see if we were
in contact with Grandfather.

969
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,134
What did we do wrong?

970
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:03,742
Our phone's always been bugged.
I thought it was over...

971
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,674
...but I guess I was wrong.

972
01:28:06,247 --> 01:28:08,010
I know it sounds crazy...

973
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:11,743
...but who's to say that
your Israeli friend isn't from Mossad?

974
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:16,750
Right! And if he isn't, I'm sure he'll
want to join after tonight's show.

975
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:46,652
Eyal?

976
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:15,935
He's alive. He's here at the villa.

977
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:18,237
- Sit down.
- He's there. I saw him.

978
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:20,710
I thought he'd come.

979
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:22,678
He's very old,
but we can get him out.

980
01:30:22,884 --> 01:30:24,715
There are no bodyguards,
just a nurse.

981
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:26,480
Take this.

982
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:30,958
Are you crazy? Let's get him out...

983
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,491
...and bring him to trial in Israel.
- Eyal!

984
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:37,494
It's really no problem. We can do it,
just the two of us. We just need a car...

985
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:38,721
...and we'll drive him
to the pickup point.

986
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:41,868
You don't get it. Nobody knows.

987
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:46,568
- What do you mean? We're...
- There's no we, no car, no pickup.

988
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,176
You have to finish this yourself.

989
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:52,539
Only you. Terminate him!

990
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:55,581
- Terminate him?
- Yes.

991
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,347
- Terminate.
- But, Menachem...

992
01:30:59,687 --> 01:31:02,918
- We can get him out.
- Eyal, listen carefully.

993
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:07,925
Why did you come here? To find this
man, right? Now you've found him.

994
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,962
So maybe he's half-dead,
but only half.

995
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:15,397
And this is our chance. Not to
let him escape without punishment.

996
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,238
Go! Do the right thing.

997
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,172
For me, for your mother.

998
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:23,232
Go!

999
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:25,040
Don't be afraid.

1000
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:30,941
Get him before God does?

1001
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:34,445
Yes. Get him before God does.

1002
01:36:10,965 --> 01:36:13,058
Iris, my wife.

1003
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:17,227
She didn't just leave, you see.

1004
01:36:20,374 --> 01:36:22,171
She killed herself.

1005
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,741
She left me a note.

1006
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:29,310
She wrote that I kill everything
that comes near me.

1007
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,413
I can't kill anymore.

1008
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:45,064
I don't want to kill anymore.

1009
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:57,561
Hi, Axel.

1010
01:37:57,771 --> 01:38:01,434
It's 5:00 in the morning,
and Tohm is finally asleep again.

1011
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:05,177
I knew I shouldn't have listened to you
and your dear sister.

1012
01:38:05,412 --> 01:38:09,007
All that talk about having babies
and how it would change my life.

1013
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:12,515
It did. I have become
a sleepless slave.

1014
01:38:13,687 --> 01:38:16,383
I would go back to bed now,
but I can't.

1015
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:18,785
We're picking melons this week.

1016
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:23,556
Anyhow, you and this Andreas
of yours should come for a visit.

1017
01:38:23,764 --> 01:38:25,664
You know,
do the loving-uncle thing...

1018
01:38:25,866 --> 01:38:28,198
...so Pia and I can get away
for a few days.

1019
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:33,338
The truth is,
being a father is not that terrible.

1020
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,940
It's actually quite fascinating.

1021
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:39,044
All kinds of new things
are happening to me.

1022
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,572
I dream.

1023
01:38:41,815 --> 01:38:44,409
Last night,
I even dreamt about you.

1024
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:47,553
We were in the North again,
by the Sea of Galilee.

1025
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,883
And you take off your sandals,
step forward...

1026
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:53,423
...and simply begin
to walk on the water.

1027
01:38:53,627 --> 01:38:56,687
And you don't fall.
You don't sink, nothing.

1028
01:38:56,897 --> 01:38:59,161
You're just walking on water...

1029
01:38:59,366 --> 01:39:02,301
...as though it were
the easiest thing in the world.

1030
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:03,970
And then you turn around...

1031
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:06,435
...and hold out your hand, and I...

1032
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,467
I follow you.

1033
01:39:08,876 --> 01:39:11,674
And suddenly both of us
are walking on water.

1034
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:14,245
And we keep walking and walking.

1035
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:16,439
There is this music all around us.

1036
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:19,919
And I look at you,
and you smile at me...

1037
01:39:20,888 --> 01:39:23,721
...and everything is so peaceful.

1038
01:39:25,492 --> 01:39:27,392
And we feel good.

1039
01:39:27,594 --> 01:39:29,027
Just...

1040
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:31,389
...good.
