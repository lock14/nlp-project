00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,240
<i>Brendan?

3
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,160
Emily?

4
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,560
<i>Yeah.

5
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
<i>How's things?

6
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,080
Status quo.

7
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,080
<i>Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

8
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,840
<i>That's good.

9
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,760
What's going on, Em?

10
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,520
<i>You know, it's good
to see you, Brendan.

11
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,520
<i>It's been some time.

12
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,800
Two months.

13
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,680
<i>Yeah, I didn't even know your
locker. I had to ask Brain.

14
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,600
Em, why don't
we meet somewhere?

15
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,000
<i>I can't.

16
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,320
Why not?

17
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,440
<i>I screwed up real bad,
you know.

18
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,360
<i>I really screwed up.

19
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Screwed up how?

20
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,680
<i>Look, I did what she said with the
brick. I didn't know it was bad,

21
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,120
<i>but The Pin's on it now for poor
Frisco, and they're playing it all on me.

22
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,080
Slow down, now. What?

23
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,600
<i>You gotta help me, Brendan.
Please.

24
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,360
<i>I think Tug... Oh, no!

25
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,640
Brain!

26
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,480
Brendan, it's been awhile.

27
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,400
Where you been eating?
Back of school.

28
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,400
Yeah, no one's seen you.

29
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,440
What's it been, a couple
of months? It's been awhile.

30
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,480
You gave Emily
my locker number?

31
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,640
Few days ago, was I wrong?
No.

32
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,800
You know, it's been so long
I don't know your two's stats.

33
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,600
Yeah, it's been awhile.
Who's she been eating with?

34
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,400
I don't know,
that's hard to keep track.

35
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Is it?

36
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,600
Can be. Can be hard
to keep track of those things,

37
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,680
because lunch is... Lunch is a
lot of things. Lunch is difficult.

38
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,640
Uh-huh.

39
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,960
She hadn't been doing
too good, Brendan.

40
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,520
Yeah, well, I'm not looking
for a patch up.

41
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,520
Em's life is her own,
but she asked for my help.

42
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,680
Help with what?
I don't know.

43
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,720
I don't even care. It's not my business.
I just want to know she's okay.

44
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,160
So I gotta find her.
That's all this is.

45
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,360
Well, I know
she's been poking in

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
with the Ivy-bound cheerleading
elite, Laura Dannon's crowd.

47
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
Laura Dannon
there on the Linc'?

48
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,840
And Brad Bramish.

49
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,120
Cream on the upper-crust.

50
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,560
Anyway, Em tagged after them for
a bit, but it didn't work out.

51
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,160
She picked her way down
the food chain.

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
Last I saw, she was with
what's her name, the drama vamp.

53
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,880
Small-time dealer, the evil
one, the one you dated.

54
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,200
Kara.
That's my bus.

55
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,840
You know her locker number?
Kara's?

56
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,560
Em's.
269.

57
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
Thanks, Brain.

58
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,360
Keep your specs on.
Find me if she shows.

59
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,560
Will do.

60
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,360
Hello, Kara.

61
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,920
Hello, Brendan.
Kara.

62
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,360
Come to see the show?
No, I didn't.

63
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,840
Lapdog, blow.
Stay.

64
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,440
I need words.
Well, I'm listening.

65
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,920
About Emily Kostich.

66
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,160
Run and get my purse.
Go on, hurry up.

67
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,080
Still picking your teeth with freshmen?
Well, you were a freshmen once.

68
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,960
Way-once, sister.

69
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,840
You and Em tight for a bit.
Who's she eating with now?

70
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Eating with?
Eating with. Lunch. Who?

71
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,440
You're a cutie.

72
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,040
Brendan.

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,120
I don't know where she is.

74
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,440
I know you do, so why don't
you want me to find out?

75
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,920
Well, maybe
I'm looking out for you.

76
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,480
Oh, I appreciate that.

77
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,240
Brendan.

78
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,840
If you're ever looking
to get back into things,

79
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,480
I could use you.

80
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay. So...
Go. Say your line. Okay.

81
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
Go.
So I just...

82
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,600
No, he's got to come in first,
and then you can say your line.

83
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,880
<i>Hello?

84
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,840
Yes, hello, ma'am, this is
Tom. I'm a friend from school.

85
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,320
Could I speak to...

86
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,640
<i>Oh, sure, Tom.
Laura's here. Just a sec.

87
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,600
<i>Yes?

88
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
<i>I'm calling for details.
For what?

89
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,840
<i>Details about the party.
Who is this?

90
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,120
<i>Or I'll hang up.
You don't know me. I'll save you some time.

91
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,480
<i>I know everyone, and I have
all the time in the world.

92
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
Folly of youth.

93
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,440
Ask whose invitation I've got.

94
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,400
<i>What you said...
Emily Kostich.

95
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,560
<i>15 Busch Street, in Stockton Cove.
Buzz 42 at the gate.

96
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,960
<i>9:00. But who gave you...

97
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,040
"The sun, whose rays
Are all ablaze

98
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,760
"With ever-living glory,

99
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,520
"Does not deny
His majesty

100
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,920
"He scorns to tell a story!

101
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,600
"He don't exclaim,

102
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,000
"'I blush for shame
So kindly be indulgent. '

103
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,600
"But, fierce and bold,

104
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,760
"In fiery gold
His glories all effulgent!

105
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,680
"I mean to rule the earth
As he the sky

106
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,120
"We really know our worth
The sun and I!"

107
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,080
And the stupid coach,
the coach won't let me play.

108
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,880
So, cheers.

109
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,320
Beautiful. I mean,
I am Brad Bramish, Coach.

110
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,920
You gotta let me play.

111
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,600
How am I supposed to put in
my best game

112
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
if I'm worried about whether
or not I'm gonna be in there?

113
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,240
Hey.

114
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Hey!

115
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,480
What are you doing here?
Leaving.

116
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,360
Oh, yeah?

117
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,680
Brad's not the kind of guy
you wanna mess with.

118
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,760
Fearless flyer.

119
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Quit your yapping
and fix me one.

120
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
I'll never get through
all this.

121
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,040
Uh-huh.

122
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,040
So why are you here tonight?
I'm looking for Emily.

123
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,000
Em's been AWOL for a good
month. Nobody's seen her.

124
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,000
I saw her yesterday.

125
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,960
Nearly nobody.

126
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,040
Listen, you're scratching
at the wrong door.

127
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,520
I didn't know Em well enough to
know the details of what she was in.

128
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,920
I just got wind
of the downfall.

129
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,600
If you haven't got a finger in
Em's troubles, then why did her name

130
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,240
get me into your
rather exclusive party?

131
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,760
Keep up with me now. I don't
know, but it sounded like you did.

132
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,800
And a body's got a right
to be curious.

133
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,120
Now I'm not so sure.
Well, put that body to bed.

134
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,960
I don't know a damn thing about
whatever troubles and that works for me.

135
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,280
I just want to find her.

136
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,880
Coffee and Pie.

137
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,560
Coffee and Pie, Oh My?

138
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
And you didn't hear it
from me.

139
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,920
It's Tugger.
All right.

140
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,840
Will you wait here for me?
Sure.

141
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,840
You'll sit right here and
wait? I'll just be five minutes.

142
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,440
Yes.
Okay.

143
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,160
Why don't you
say something?

144
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,760
I will not talk
about this.

145
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,640
We'll talk about this
right now! I won't!

146
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,360
I'll talk about this now!

147
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,720
Where's Dode?

148
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,560
Hey, Brendan,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

149
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,120
Kara told me
you know where Em's at.

150
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
And why you looking for Em?

151
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,640
She asked for my help.

152
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,480
Well, listen, man, I got plenty on my
plate without dealing with some jilted ex.

153
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,520
It's not about that.

154
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,680
Well, whatever it's about, act
smarter than you look and drop it.

155
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,920
Where's she at?

156
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,880
You better get
while it's good.

157
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Heel it now, dig?

158
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,280
Throw one at me if you want, hash-head. I
got all five senses and I slept last night.

159
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,240
That puts me six-up
on the lot of you.

160
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,560
Just easy, bro.

161
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,800
Where's Em?

162
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,080
All right! All right!
All right!

163
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,600
Where's Em?

164
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,240
She's with me.

165
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,040
She was tight when she called
you, man. Came to me freaked.

166
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,360
Told me to shake you
if you came by.

167
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,080
Said you'd only
make things worse.

168
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,240
Deal with whatever
this ain't about and drop it.

169
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,280
Tell Em I wanna see her.

170
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,840
Tell her if she wants my help
or not, it's her business.

171
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,800
But I want to hear it straight
from her. She don't want...

172
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Today! She knows
where I eat lunch.

173
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,640
And stay out, man!

174
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,760
I must've sounded pretty crazy
on the phone yesterday.

175
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,800
You just gotta
forget about it.

176
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,840
That's how you can
help me out, is just,

177
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,600
please, forget about it.

178
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,320
Brendan,

179
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,680
I know that you're mad
at all these people,

180
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,120
because you think I went away
from you and went to them.

181
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,960
But you got to start seeing it
as my decision.

182
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,000
You know, stop getting angry
just because where I wanna be at

183
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,360
is different from
where you wanna be at, okay?

184
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,240
Who fed you that line, Em?

185
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,960
Stop picking on Dode. Okay?
He's a good guy.

186
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,440
The Pie House rat?

187
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,280
He's a good friend.

188
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,840
So what am I?

189
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,160
Yeah, I mean, what are you?

190
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,680
Eating back here,
hating everybody.

191
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,800
I mean,
who are you judging anyone?

192
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,680
God I...
I really loved you a lot.

193
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,600
I couldn't stand it.

194
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,840
I had to get with people. I couldn't
handle life with you, anymore.

195
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm sorry, Brendan. I'm sorry.

196
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
You gotta come back to me, Em.
No!

197
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,920
You're in a spot but I can get you
out of it, if you just come back to me.

198
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,600
No, you're not hearing me!
I don't wanna be put away

199
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,120
and protected. Whatever
befalls you, I'll deal with.

200
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,120
No.

201
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,120
Just tell me about the trouble
with the brick, The Pin.

202
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,320
What? Are you gonna fix
things, like you did with Jerr?

203
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,080
No. Okay?

204
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,800
I came here to say goodbye.
Okay? For good.

205
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,480
Whatever you have to do
to let me go, you gotta do it.

206
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,800
You gotta promise me, though,
okay? You have to.

207
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,080
That you're not... You're not
gonna torture yourself.

208
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
Please.

209
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,240
That you're...
You're just gonna let me go.

210
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,080
Just let me go.

211
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,880
Do you know anything
else about this? No.

212
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,200
Slim pickings.

213
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,480
Why did you let Dode fly
when he went back to,

214
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,960
who's her name, at the theater? Kara.

215
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,960
It's their turf. I couldn't
hear them without being seen,

216
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,000
and that would only
biff their play.

217
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,360
Best to know that it's there, let
it ride and see what comes of it.

218
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
Anyway. Well, if this
is what I think it is,

219
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,480
it didn't come straight from Dode,
unless he's playing out of his league.

220
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,280
I can only give you my best guess. Yeah.

221
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,960
When the upper crust
does shady deeds,

222
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,920
they do them in different
places around town.

223
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,960
One of them is by the pier, another
one is by the bike trails in State Park.

224
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,160
I mean, there's a lot of them.

225
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,040
And the pitch is, they've got
little symbols for each one.

226
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,600
So they can tell each other the
place without word getting around.

227
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,400
This might be that.
But Dode wouldn't know it?

228
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,360
No, this is the upper crust.
Dode's pie-pan grease.

229
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,520
Call anything up?

230
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,880
How many places
start with "A"?

231
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,880
Or if it's a shape,
could be just a random symbol.

232
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,680
Even if you figure it out,
what good would you do?

233
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,680
You said her business
was none of yours.

234
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,320
So she's all right.

235
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,080
Forget it now, go home. Sleep.

236
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,840
Brendan, you're up early.
Couldn't sleep.

237
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,560
Find Emily?

238
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,000
You all right?

239
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,960
Yeah.
What are you here for, zero?

240
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,560
Forced into taking the early bus.
The others don't run by my street.

241
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,440
So what's the word with Em?

242
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,800
She's gone.
Can't raise her?

243
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,320
No, I can't.

244
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,080
So what now?

245
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,640
Now, I don't know. I guess...

246
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,360
I don't know.

247
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,040
I can't let her go, Brain.

248
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,440
I was set to, but I can't.
I don't think I can.

249
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,280
Do you think you can help her?

250
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,120
No.

251
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,840
You think you can get the straight,
maybe break some deserving teeth?

252
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,360
Yeah, I think I could.

253
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,080
Well...

254
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Tell me to walk from this,
Brain.

255
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,800
Tell me to drop it.
Walk from it. Drop it.

256
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,360
But you're thick, Brendan.

257
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,880
Yes, I am.

258
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,800
I need you to op.

259
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,880
Like on Jerr, but that was
cake to this, and unlike Jerr,

260
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
there's not much chance
of coming out clean.

261
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,480
24/7 on this one.

262
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,440
You okay to op for me again?

263
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,120
So what first, tip the bulls?
No.

264
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,600
Bulls would gum it.

265
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,680
They'd flash their dusty
standards at the wide-eyes,

266
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,920
probably find some yegg to pin,
probably even the right one.

267
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,320
But they'd trample the real
tracks and scare the real players

268
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,400
back into their holes.

269
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,880
If we're doing this, I want the
whole story. No cops, not for a bit.

270
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,920
So what's first?

271
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't know.

272
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,280
Your mom still have that cell?
In her car.

273
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,120
Can I borrow it for
a few days? Get me the number?

274
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,120
Yeah.
Wait for my word.

275
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,120
And cover for me first.

276
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,960
I'm gonna be a little late.

277
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,240
<i>Stop it. What did you do, Brendan?

278
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,160
<i>Are you crying for
him? You're crying for Jerr?

279
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,200
<i>Trueman went straight
for him. He knew the lay!

280
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,160
<i>You ratted on Jerr!
Stop it now, Em!

281
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,120
<i>What, you telling me
it isn't true? Look at me!

282
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,600
<i>You ratted him out,
because you were jealous!

283
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,960
<i>No, I spun on him and
I bulled the two-bit toker,

284
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,760
<i>'cause I know what his world
would do to you!

285
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,200
<i>I love you too much
to see that!

286
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,000
<i>You don't love me,
you just wanna keep me!

287
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,920
<i>You're the only thing I love!

288
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,440
<i>You're the only thing I love!

289
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,520
<i>And this is how I do it.

290
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,080
I wanna keep you safe.

291
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,400
You can't keep me safe,
Brendan, all right?

292
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,200
I'm in a different world now.

293
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,200
And you can't keep me out
of it, and you can't beat it.

294
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,280
Not if I don't want you to.

295
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,360
Here's the cell number. Yeah.
Keep it on vibrate.

296
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,840
Better stop meeting me
in the open, too.

297
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,840
I'm gonna start getting visible.
I need you on the underneath.

298
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,320
I'll call. Trueman, the
Ass. VP, wants words.

299
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,960
I'll bet he does.
Keep him off me.

300
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Stonewall him, he won't bite.
Just keep him away from me.

301
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,960
I'll try. So what's first?
Make Em's troubles mine.

302
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,240
Emily said four words I didn't
know. Tell me if they catch.

303
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,920
Brick.
No.

304
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,840
Or bad brick.
No.

305
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,640
Tug?
Tug.

306
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,120
Tug, might be a drink.

307
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,520
Like milk and vodka,
or something.

308
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,240
Poor Frisco.
Frisco.

309
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,120
Frisco Farr was
a sophomore last year.

310
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,080
Real trash.
Maybe hit a class a week.

311
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,840
Didn't know him then
and haven't seen him around.

312
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,320
Pin.
Pin.

313
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,120
The Pin?
The Pin, yeah?

314
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,120
The Pin's kind of a local spook
story. You know the kingpin.

315
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,440
I've heard it.
Same thing.

316
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,720
Supposed to be old,
like 26. Lives in town.

317
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,280
Dope runner, right?
Big time.

318
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,000
See, The Pin pipes it from the lowest
scraper to Brad Bramish himself.

319
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,720
Maybe. I mean, ask any dope rat
where the junk sprang, and they'll say

320
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,400
they scraped it off that, who scored
it off this, who bought it off someone.

321
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,760
After four or five connections,
the list always end with The Pin.

322
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,520
But I bet you, you got every rat in
town together and said show your hands

323
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,480
if any of them have actually seen The Pin,
and you'd get a crowd of full pockets.

324
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,000
You think The Pin's just
a tale to take whatever heat?

325
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,280
But what's first?

326
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,000
A show of hands.

327
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,280
Hello, Brendan, are you
here for the show? No.

328
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,360
Well, then, could you go then,
honey? 'Cause I have this headache.

329
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,720
Try smoking like a chimney.
I've heard that helps.

330
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,120
Hey, isn't this Dode's brand?

331
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,560
You don't know Dode's brand.
I do now.

332
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,240
I'm gonna start shaking
things up.

333
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,160
Give me the story,
you might miss the bite.

334
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,360
The story about what?
All right.

335
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
The story about what?

336
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,040
I don't want to play games
if you've got a headache.

337
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,240
Get me
if you want to spill it,

338
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,520
but I can't guarantee
safe passage after tonight.

339
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,920
I don't know...
Tell The Pin

340
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,520
that Brad was my calling card,
and I need words.

341
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,040
Brad Bramish?

342
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,920
Tail Kara at lunch. She's got
rehearsal, but she'll blow early.

343
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,560
She goes home, drop her,
or else wait for my call.

344
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,400
Will do.

345
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,800
I mean, am I crazy, huh?

346
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,600
I mean, this is all
I am trying to say here!

347
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,640
Okay, if you put me
in the game,

348
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,120
Brad Bramish is gonna do
what needs to be done, baby.

349
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,120
Okay?
But they don't put me in!

350
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,080
What needs doing,
ain't gonna get done!

351
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,720
Huh? And then
don't come crying to me.

352
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,400
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! If you don't
put me in the game!

353
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,680
Now, am I right?
Of course I'm right!

354
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,480
And don't come to me
if you don't let me play!

355
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,200
Didn't.
Shut up!

356
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,280
Hey!

357
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,000
What are you doing here?
Just listening.

358
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,440
All right, you got me.
I'm a scout for the Gophers.

359
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,920
Been watching your game for a month, but
that story right there, just clenched it.

360
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You got heart, kid. How soon
can you be in Minneapolis?

361
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,560
Yeah?

362
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Cold winters, but they got
a great public transit system.

363
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,160
Yeah?
Yeah.

364
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,360
Oh, yeah?

365
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,600
There's a thesaurus in the
library. "Yeah" is under "Y."

366
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,280
Go ahead, I'll wait.
You know, who invited you?

367
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,080
To the parking lot?

368
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,360
Gee, I guess I invited myself.

369
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,840
Maybe you wanna
go somewhere more private.

370
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,920
With you? Sure.

371
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,960
If this boy knows what's good
for him, he'll just beat it.

372
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,760
Whooping this small fry's butt
ain't gonna help me none.

373
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,240
Sure ain't gonna help him,
neither.

374
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,120
Come on, Brad!

375
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,400
Hey, was there a fight?
Yeah.

376
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,720
You're quite a pill.

377
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,920
Uh-huh.

378
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,160
Where are you going?
Home.

379
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,400
Why did you take
a powder the other night?

380
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,160
Same reason I'm taking one now. Hold it!

381
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,640
I wanna help you.
Go away.

382
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,160
Look, I can't trust you. You ought
to be smart enough to know that.

383
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,200
I didn't shake up the party
to get your attention,

384
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,680
and I'm not heeling
you to hook you.

385
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,040
Your connections could help me,
but the bad baggage they bring

386
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,440
could make it zero sum gain
or even hurt me.

387
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,320
Better off coming at it clean.

388
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,960
I wouldn't have
to lead you in by the...

389
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,040
I can't trust you.

390
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,640
Brad was a sap, you weren't.

391
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,280
You're with him,
so you're playing him.

392
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,760
So you're a player.

393
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,640
With you behind me,
I'd have to tie one eye up,

394
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,360
watching both of your hands.
I can't spare it.

395
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,000
You're not Brad.
No, I'm not.

396
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,600
<i>You didn't call. Sorry. Kara
went home though, didn't she?

397
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,920
<i>Yeah, but she stopped
at a payphone

398
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,840
<i>and made two calls that she
didn't want on her phone bill.

399
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,200
<i>Get the numbers?
No. Sorry.

400
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,800
It's all right.
Me and Brad front-page news?

401
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,040
<i>- All the buzz. You really do that?
- Yeah.

402
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,240
<i>- Why? Is Brad The Pin?
- Brad is a sap.

403
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,080
I downed him on his field,
and his crew didn't bite.

404
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,240
So now I know he's a sap, and anyone who
acts like he isn't is profiting by it.

405
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,680
That's not why I roughed him,
though.

406
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,040
<i>- For kicks?
- Economics.

407
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,680
Brad's the school's biggest
jake buyer,

408
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,360
so if this Pin is behind all the
selling, I just got his attention.

409
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,000
Anyway, now we've shaken the tree, let's
wait and see what falls on our heads.

410
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,040
<i>Will do.

411
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,440
<i>So you didn't know
this boy?

412
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,000
- No sir, never seen him.
- And he just hit you?

413
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,240
Like I said, he asked
for my lunch money first.

414
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,160
Good thing I brown-bagged it.

415
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,920
Okay, Brendan, I've been
looking to talk to you.

416
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,360
And you've helped
this office out before.

417
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,640
No, I gave you Jerr to see
him eaten, not to see you fed.

418
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,080
Fine.

419
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,360
Very well put.

420
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,840
Accelerated English.
Mrs. Kasprzyk.

421
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,400
- Tough teacher.
- Tough, but fair.

422
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,040
Okay, we know you're clean.

423
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,360
And you've...

424
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,920
Despite your motives, you've
always been an asset to this office.

425
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,560
And you're a good kid.

426
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,600
I want to run some names
past you.

427
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,840
- Hold it, we're not done here.
- I was done here three months ago.

428
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,920
I told you then I'd give
you Jerr, and that was that.

429
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,160
I'm not your inside line,
and I'm not your boy.

430
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,440
- That's not very--
- You know what I'm in...

431
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,080
...if the wrong yegg
saw me pulled in here?

432
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,040
- What are you in?
- No.

433
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,760
And no more of these informal chats,
either. You got a discipline issue with me,

434
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,800
write me up or suspend me,

435
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,760
- ...and I'll see you at the parent conference.
- Hold on!

436
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,840
I could write you up
for talking back to a VP

437
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,880
and for looking at me
in that threatening way.

438
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,640
I would exercise
a little tact, Mr. Frye.

439
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,920
You can't pull a stunt like that
unless there's something I need you for.

440
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,600
- So is there?
- Maybe.

441
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,840
Maybe.

442
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,440
Maybe there's something
you need from me.

443
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,000
Maybe.

444
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,360
All right, I need you off my back
completely for the next few weeks.

445
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,680
There might be some heat soon.

446
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,400
If it's something I can't
cover, I won't go to bat for you.

447
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
If I get caught like that,
it's curtains anyway.

448
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,600
I can't have brass
cutting me favors in public.

449
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,080
I'm just letting you know now,

450
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,560
so you don't come kicking in my
homeroom door once trouble starts.

451
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,880
Okay. Okay,
here's what I can do.

452
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,160
I won't pin you for anything
you aren't caught at.

453
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,400
But if anything comes up with your
prints on it, I can't help you.

454
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,760
Also, if I get to the bottom
of whatever this is,

455
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,720
and it gets too hot,
and you don't deliver,

456
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,880
VP's gonna need someone
to turn over, police-wise,

457
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,640
I'll have you.

458
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,360
So there better be some meat at
the end of this, like you say.

459
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,400
Or at least a fall guy.

460
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,160
Or you're it.

461
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,200
<i>Nope, Dode is MIA.

462
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,720
I'm 9 of 10 that Kara's got
him, but who knows where.

463
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,920
I shook,
but she's not spilling.

464
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,680
<i>No more job offers,
so she's gotta play.

465
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,120
And I know enough about Kara
to let that worry me.

466
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,080
All right, keep your specs on
for him. Any other news?

467
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,760
<i>Some. Laura Dannon came
to me, looking for you.

468
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,840
<i>- She did, huh?
- Fourth period.

469
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,280
<i>Nearly shook me upside down.

470
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,520
<i>Can't say I didn't enjoy it.
But why'd she come to me?

471
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
She's tapping Kara,
and Kara knows you know me.

472
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,920
<i>Yeah, well,
she's some piece of work.

473
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
<i>If I had known where you were,
I might have told her.

474
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,360
That's the spirit.

475
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,800
Ask around for Dode.
Tail Kara again at lunch.

476
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,760
I've got knives in my eyes.
I'm going home sick.

477
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
<i>- I'll call you tonight.
- All right.

478
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
I wanna see The Pin.

479
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,280
I wanna see The Pin.

480
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,800
I guess you do.

481
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,680
You The Pin?

482
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,600
Yeah.

483
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,920
So now I'm very, very curious
what you're gonna say next.

484
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,160
Maybe I'll just sit here
and bleed at you.

485
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,560
Helled, if you're gonna go
breaking my best clients' noses

486
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,560
and expect me to play sandbag.

487
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,520
Anyway, you've been
sniffing me out before then.

488
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,400
Sniffing for me
like a vampire bat

489
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,000
for a horse with a nick on
its ear that he can suck on.

490
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,320
They do that.

491
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,520
So now you got Tugger
to bring you in,

492
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,200
which he never does.

493
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,440
And you got me listening.

494
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,960
So I'm very curious what you have to say
that better be really, really good.

495
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,320
Why don't you call Ms. Dannon in from
the hall first? She ought to hear this.

496
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,960
No dice, soldier.

497
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,640
Would've been a neat trick,
though.

498
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,320
I was just gonna come up
with some bit of information

499
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,040
or set up some phony deal,
anything. She'd let me walk.

500
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,360
Then I was gonna go to the Vice
Principal and spill him the street address

501
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,280
of the biggest dope
port in the burgh.

502
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,600
He knows zippo.

503
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,800
1250 Vista Blanca, the ink
blotter on the desk, in the den,

504
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,640
in the basement of the house
with the tacky mailbox.

505
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,080
You gonna do what now?

506
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,480
No good, soldier.

507
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,760
All right, Tugger, enough.

508
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Tug!

509
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,320
Tug, stop!

510
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,120
My glasses?

511
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,320
The hell with you then.
Which wall is the door in?

512
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,240
Sorry about this, kid.

513
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,680
But what the hell
with what you said before?

514
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,680
Where you were at, with all
of us and Tug a fist away.

515
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,480
You gotta use your nut.

516
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,880
Allay the situation.

517
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,680
So, yeah,
you're not scared of me.

518
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,640
I got it.

519
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,840
But I'm also thinking
you're a little nuts, now.

520
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,880
So you've got that tradeoff
with your situation.

521
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,840
But nuts isn't all bad,

522
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,800
so maybe it was a good play.

523
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,440
I don't know.

524
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,240
So Laura talked me down.

525
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,040
Why don't we take you
upstairs, back with the living?

526
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,880
I thought we had orange juice,
Brendan. I'm sorry.

527
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,320
How about some Tang?

528
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,480
- No, that's more like soda, isn't it?
- Water's fine, ma'am. Thanks.

529
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,560
Wait a minute, we have apple
juice here, if you'd like that.

530
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,200
Or we've got milk, but you're
having that on your corn flakes.

531
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,480
Apple juice sounds terrific.

532
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,880
It's country style.

533
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,920
That's perfect.

534
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And I'll even give it to you
in a little country glass.

535
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,320
How about that?

536
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,960
Boys?
I'm fine, Mrs. M.

537
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,160
Thanks, Mom.

538
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,600
Okay, well,

539
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,320
I'm gonna go do something
in the other room.

540
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,560
So, how abouts we take another
snap at hearing your tale?

541
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,760
I don't know. It starts out same as
before. I mean, this floor ain't carpeted.

542
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,800
We're cooled off.

543
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,640
Your muscle seemed pretty cool
putting his fist in my head.

544
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,920
I want him out.

545
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,280
- Looky, soldier--
- The ape blows or I clam.

546
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,640
So clam!

547
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,960
What've you got I can't beat
out of you back in the basement?

548
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,640
Give us a few minutes, Tug.

549
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,120
I'll call you if whatever.

550
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,520
So?

551
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,200
About a year ago, I had a small-time
dealing partnership with Jerr Madison.

552
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,640
- Know him?
- 'Till he took the fall for you.

553
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,640
Yeah, well.

554
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,760
I didn't ask him to,
but he was a straight player,

555
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,800
and I got out clean.
Almost.

556
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,200
Nothing on my official record, but
the VPs play it like I owe them one.

557
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,720
When I made it clear I wasn't
gonna be playing their hound dog,

558
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,200
well, they didn't like it.

559
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,480
They keep badgering me,
calling me in.

560
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,960
- Gee, that's tough.
- I don't like being told whose side I'm on.

561
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,680
So now they think
I'm on your trail.

562
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,040
I'm in a nice spot
to know their movements,

563
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,600
feed them yours.

564
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,840
- I got you.
- You haven't got me, yet.

565
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,120
What? Price?

566
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,280
Considering the benefits
my services could yield,

567
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,720
I don't think
that's unreasonable.

568
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,880
And what are your
services exactly?

569
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,880
So I can be specific
on the invoice.

570
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,160
Whatever serves
your interests.

571
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,400
Fair enough.

572
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,920
I'll have my boys
check your tale,

573
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,320
and seeing how it stretches,
we'll either rub or hire you.

574
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,120
You'll know which by the end
of the day tomorrow.

575
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,080
We're done.

576
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,440
I'll drive you back.

577
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,640
Just drop me at school.

578
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,880
- How long was I out?
- Half an hour.

579
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,840
It took all of it for me
to cool The Pin down.

580
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,600
Thanks.

581
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,680
You trust me now?

582
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,640
Less now than when
I didn't trust you before.

583
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,840
Maybe if you can tell me your
angle in all this, I could.

584
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,560
Emily tried to get with Brad
and I about three months ago.

585
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,160
Three months ago.
And you stonewalled her.

586
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,400
Oh, all right. If you've already
got the world's address...

587
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,800
Three months ago.

588
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,000
And I liked her, but she
wasn't us and it didn't work.

589
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,040
And when she left, she took
some souvenirs with her.

590
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,240
Dirty habits she wasn't
strong enough to control

591
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,320
and a connection to The Pin
to keep them going.

592
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,120
A few months pass,
and the next I hear,

593
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,800
The Pin's raging over a certain
situation with the junk Em's partial to.

594
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,360
And it's all coming
down on her head.

595
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,960
You're saying Em scraped
the junk off The Pin?

596
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,040
I don't care how hard she was
hooked, I don't buy that.

597
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,160
You weren't there. She wasn't
herself. It had dug deep.

598
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,720
It was awful.

599
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,680
And whether she scraped
or copped

600
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,640
or just ran her tab around the
world and into her own back,

601
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,240
it must've been grand.

602
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,520
I've never seen
The Pin so hot.

603
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,280
And when he thought his precious,
his bricks of whatever it was,

604
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,200
when one of them was missing,

605
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,360
he scared me.

606
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,240
Why are you telling me
all this? What's your play?

607
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,600
You think nobody sees you.

608
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,400
Eating lunch
behind the portables.

609
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,040
Loving some girl like she's
all there is, anywhere, to you.

610
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,720
I always seen you.

611
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,320
Or maybe I liked Emily.

612
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,560
Maybe I see what
you're trying to do for her,

613
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,680
trying to help her,

614
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,240
and I don't know anybody
who would do that for me.

615
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,480
Now you are dangerous.

616
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,400
- Devlin, should I actually kiss her here?
- No, no.

617
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,880
Move on to the next scene.

618
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,000
Brendan. Brendan. Brendan.

619
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,880
Where's Dode flopped?

620
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,160
I know you two are cozed up,
so you tell me or you won't.

621
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,320
Now, last time I checked,

622
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,160
you were giving me ultimatums.

623
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,160
It worked. You went
to Laura, told her my tale.

624
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,520
- Part of the plan?
- Turned out to be.

625
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,040
I just feel so cheap and used.

626
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,960
Gol, I must seem a real cad.
Sometimes I just hate myself.

627
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,920
- Whatever happened to us, Brendan?
- Where's Dode flopped?

628
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,240
We used to be
a pair and a half.

629
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,640
Sometimes I miss
having someone to talk to.

630
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,760
Do you ever miss
having someone to talk to?

631
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,040
Oh, yeah.

632
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,840
You must.

633
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,640
I need to hear Dode's tale
about Emily. It's important.

634
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,200
Well, you better be sure you
wanna know what you wanna know.

635
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,280
Laura's working with me now, and I'll
have The Pin and Tug in my corner soon.

636
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,320
The sooner I get the truth from Dode,
or the truth about Dode from you,

637
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,240
the safer you'll both be.

638
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,400
No?

639
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,280
Pass it on to Dode, anyway.

640
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,760
Maybe he'll have the sense to get out
from under you before he gets hurt.

641
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,160
You didn't.

642
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,320
Did you?

643
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,840
<i>So Dode and Kara are shacked
up, but what's their play?

644
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,360
I don't know, Dode passed Emily
the note. He knows something.

645
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,560
Now Kara's got him under her
thumb, she's gonna use him somehow.

646
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,920
But I don't know
and I don't know.

647
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,440
So all we can do is wait
until she shows some cards.

648
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,240
Anyway, tomorrow we see if The
Pin hires me or breaks my knees.

649
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,560
I give us 70:30. And if we're in, I
get under his skin and see what's what.

650
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,120
You stick to Kara. Keep your
specs peeled for Dode.

651
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,400
And stay away from Laura.

652
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,000
<i>I think she's with us,
Brendan.

653
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,120
I'll let you know when she is.

654
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,240
<i>Okay.

655
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,120
You the Pin's?

656
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,320
What's his answer?

657
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,400
Chuck Burns. Long-haired
lug, deals, shines a blade.

658
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,240
<i>I know him. I just can't
pin him to any crowd.

659
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,680
<i>He's definitely not
muscle for anyone.

660
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,640
<i>He taps the Carrows crowd,
but doesn't hang with them.

661
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,240
<i>I mean, if you've got a guess,
I could check it out.

662
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,000
Pin. If he's with The Pin everything's
kablooie, and I gotta blow the burgh.

663
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,840
<i>I'll check it.
I'm in third now.

664
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,920
Never mind.

665
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,080
If I don't call by 3:00,
call in the bulls.

666
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,200
So?

667
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,560
So.

668
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,040
That's what you'll get
every week for your services.

669
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,240
Unless, of course, there's
some specific job,

670
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,680
in which you'll
get sliced in with my crew.

671
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,160
- Square?
- Yeah.

672
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,960
We're doing a thing tonight
down at the Hole.

673
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,080
Know it?

674
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,360
South of T Street. Yeah.

675
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,440
It's a little
welcome-you-in thing.

676
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,320
Six o'clock.

677
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,520
<i>I know what you did.
I was in the tunnel.

678
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,680
<i>I saw you hide her.

679
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,160
Dode.

680
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,840
<i>Anyone I tell,
it would ruin you some way.

681
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,920
<i>And I'm gonna tell someone.

682
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,240
<i>- Are you making an offer?
- Maybe.

683
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,560
<i>Or maybe I'll just do you in.

684
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,320
Hire another hash head
to blade me?

685
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,240
<i>Don't need no blades, shamus.

686
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,880
<i>- I just gotta squawk.
- What do you want?

687
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,880
<i>Just to see you sweat.

688
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,000
<i>- Brendan?
- Brain.

689
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,840
<i>Are you all right?

690
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,760
So I'm gonna start you
on the dope circles.

691
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,320
Anyway, there's not
much else doing.

692
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,840
I'm tailing out this big deal,
but it's almost done.

693
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,880
Oh, yeah, what was it?

694
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,640
It was big time.
Biggest I ever done.

695
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,480
And there was a snag in it,
but it's almost done now.

696
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,120
What was it?

697
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,560
You're going to make
me curious, being so curious.

698
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,680
I want to lay something out.

699
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,440
You're coming into
a certain situation,

700
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,400
and I'm sort of bringing
you in because of it.

701
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,760
I didn't tell Tug to hit you
for the Brad Bramish thing.

702
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,280
He got hot
and he just hit you.

703
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,760
He's been doing that.

704
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,120
Yeah?

705
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,160
Yeah.

706
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,280
Muscle you can't control's
no good at that.

707
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:54,120
You're working for me,
not for Tug. That's all.

708
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,760
All right.

709
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,680
It's tough sometimes.

710
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,600
It's twisted.

711
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,120
Complicated. I don't know.

712
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,840
Everyone's got their thing.

713
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,240
- You read Tolkien?
- What?

714
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,800
You know, The Hobbit books.

715
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,240
Yeah.

716
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,120
His descriptions
of things are really good.

717
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,560
Oh, yeah.

718
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,960
He makes you want to be there.

719
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,240
<i>- Don't go to class.
- What?

720
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,600
<i>Fifth period, Trueman and the
VP come in, asking for you.

721
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,080
<i>Did they call your mom?

722
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,480
Probably, I got in late.

723
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,760
<i>Get out of there, too, then.

724
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,600
<i>Meet me behind the library.
I've got some stuff.

725
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,400
Frisco Farr was found
on a sidewalk,

726
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,840
three weeks ago,
outside of Pinkerton's Deli.

727
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,880
He was in a coma.

728
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,320
His stomach contained
a sausage sandwich,

729
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,400
a horse dose of heroin

730
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,600
and traces
of choleric tricemate,

731
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,760
which is a poisonous chemical
found in laundry detergent.

732
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,120
He's still under. Nobody's
talking, so nothing's come of it.

733
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,360
- OD?
- No.

734
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,840
The chem the junk must've been
cut with put him down.

735
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,800
Bad junk, bad brick.

736
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,640
Could that form of heroin be called
brick? It was a concentrated powder.

737
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,400
Its street handle's
"whip," "rock" or "brock."

738
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,240
From Laura.

739
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,640
I told you to stay clear
of Laura.

740
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,080
You tell her
to stay clear of me?

741
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,960
I got to get voicemail.

742
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,840
No, tell her I'll be at
The Pin's at 1:00.

743
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,880
- Any news with the Lug?
- No.

744
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,720
No news.

745
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,280
- This isn't good.
- No.

746
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,600
Ask!

747
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,360
<i>Administration.

748
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,640
Gary Trueman's office, please.

749
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,960
<i>This is Trueman.

750
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,920
What the hell are you doing,
asking for me in class?

751
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
<i>What the hell are you doing
out of class?

752
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,120
What?

753
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,560
<i>The VP and I needed to ask you a
few questions about Emily Kostich,

754
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,360
<i>who you might have heard is
missing. It's a very serious thing.

755
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,400
<i>The police are involved.

756
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,000
<i>The VP and I knew
you two were close,

757
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,920
<i>so the VP and I came
to ask you questions,

758
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,720
<i>but you were truant.

759
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,600
- What?
- I've been cut loose.

760
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,000
I'm not safe here. We
shouldn't have met in the open.

761
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,680
All right, lay low, but ask
on the underneath for Dode.

762
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,280
He set up whatever
Emily walked into.

763
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,040
It's getting more and more
urgent that we talk.

764
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,040
What are you going to do?

765
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,120
I would have liked to have played
it safe, but there's no time.

766
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,520
The Pin's not letting
anything drop.

767
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,280
- I have to push things a bit.
- How?

768
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,440
I don't know. Find Dode.

769
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,760
What with the poking, genius?

770
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,320
Maybe you're poking
for your bull friends!

771
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,120
Don't be a sap. I can't even face
up at school, the VP's so hot for me!

772
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,480
Yeah, maybe
you're looking to make good!

773
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,520
I'm looking to find this
big game The Pin's played.

774
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,840
Not to gum it, but just so
when its tail jams in my back,

775
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,400
I know who to bill
for the embalming!

776
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,960
You ought to ask him
what you wanna know.

777
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,720
I did, he didn't tell me!

778
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,680
The Pin's not giving me the
straight. That makes me nervous.

779
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,240
Makes me angry.

780
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,640
Yeah.

781
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,840
That's understandable.

782
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,560
There was 10 of them.

783
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,400
I don't know where he picked
them. He didn't tell me.

784
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,080
So we get 10 kils of brock.

785
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,720
There ain't enough marks in
the whole burgh to eat that.

786
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,320
So he unloads eight up north,
even up to the docks.

787
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,480
I don't know who.
Didn't tell you.

788
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,120
Yeah.

789
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,280
That was eight.
So that's the 10th in there.

790
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,000
We gotta break it off
into doses.

791
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,560
Sell off around the High,
maybe some by Shorecliffs.

792
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,640
What about the ninth brick?

793
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,200
Yeah, there were
some problems with that.

794
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,640
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

795
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,720
It... uh... disappeared.

796
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,800
Someone skimmed it.

797
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,880
We started raising hell
with all the likely suspects,

798
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,040
and what do you know?
It came back.

799
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,440
But it came back bad.

800
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:52,200
One of ours took a dose
off the top, laid him out.

801
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,520
Frisco.

802
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,800
Yeah, poor Frisco.

803
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,760
You heard about that?

804
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,600
We'll catch the rat.

805
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,320
Just takes time.

806
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,040
I heard something
fell with Emily Kostich.

807
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,440
Emily who?

808
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,680
Kostich.

809
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,120
Don't know her.

810
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,120
- Has The Pin talked about her?
- Not to me.

811
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,320
He might know something.

812
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,080
Ask him. Tell me
what he says, 'cause,

813
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,160
you know,

814
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,920
if you heard something,
I wanna check.

815
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,800
Sure.

816
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,760
Pow-wowing?
Just shooting the shat.

817
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,840
- Yeah, just shooting it.
- Good.

818
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,880
Tug, I got a call, someone who says
they know something about Emily.

819
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,200
- Emily?
- Emily Kostich.

820
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,880
Where she's at now.

821
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,800
- Says we'd want to know. He wants to meet.
- Yeah?

822
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,240
So we'll meet.

823
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,320
Four o'clock.

824
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,200
Emily used to be Tug's girl.

825
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,760
- You know Emily, didn't you?
- A while back.

826
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:31,040
- You've heard she's missing.
- Yeah, I heard that.

827
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,320
So maybe you want
to come along, too?

828
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,400
What does Emily
got to do with you?

829
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,880
Show, maybe we'll find out.

830
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,120
Four o'clock.

831
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,560
That's my ride.

832
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,000
Four o'clock.

833
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,800
Payphone, anywhere.

834
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,560
<i>The mobile customer you have
called is not available...

835
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,000
What time is it?

836
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,240
- Brendan, you've fallen...
- What time is it?

837
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,440
3:40! You're exhausted. You've
swallowed a lot of blood!

838
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,040
- Get back in the car.
- Shut up! Shut up!

839
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,320
You need to go
to the hospital. You're sick!

840
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,360
Shut up, please! Please!

841
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,960
Okay. What you gotta do is

842
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,520
drive around to
the Pie House lot.

843
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,440
So Dode's gotta go by you or
me to get down to the tunnel.

844
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,800
If you see Dode,

845
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,960
then honk four times,
long-short, long-short.

846
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,960
And don't be seen.

847
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,840
- Get back in the car.
- Do it!

848
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,160
Please, I need you to do this.

849
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,920
I need you here.

850
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,520
Please.

851
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,440
- What are you doing, Dode?
- You gonna stop me?

852
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,800
What do you think
you're doing, Dode?

853
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,840
I saw you. I saw what you did.

854
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,040
- What did you see?
- I saw you.

855
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,000
- What'd you see me...
- I was in the tunnel, and I saw you!

856
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,880
You were with her, dead, and you
took the body! I saw you hide it!

857
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,320
Yeah, I did. That's all
you saw. What about before?

858
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,360
Before what?

859
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,160
Before I got there.
Did you see who killed her?

860
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,120
- You killed her.
- I found the body, Dode.

861
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,400
No, you...
I thought you didn't.

862
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,720
But we figured you out. I got the
news on you, 'cause you hid the body.

863
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,760
- Who's we?
- Shut up!

864
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,680
Shut up! You're always talking, always
this and that, smartso! You gotta shut up!

865
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,600
- I didn't kill her, Dode.
- You're not going to talk!

866
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,920
- Dode, I know what you think of Em.
- Shut up!

867
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,280
And I know
you tried to help her.

868
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,480
You're going
to shut your mouth!

869
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,600
Me and Kara, we're gonna bury you,
and we're gonna get paid doing it, dig?

870
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,120
We're gonna put it over
real nice!

871
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,840
I'm telling you now,
you're in over your head.

872
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,240
You don't want
to put your hand in this!

873
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,280
- She's dead! You...
- Why was she scared, Dode?

874
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,240
She came to me.
Who was she scared of?

875
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,120
- I think I know why, I just gotta know who!
- You're trying to confuse me.

876
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,360
Dode. You couldn't
stand it, your little Em.

877
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,800
She was gonna keep it. It was
mine, and you couldn't stand that!

878
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,240
- What was yours?
- I had you pegged.

879
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,520
What was yours?

880
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,440
I loved her,

881
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,160
and I would have
loved that kid.

882
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,480
I'm gonna bury you.

883
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,160
What'd I miss?

884
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,840
Dode here says
Emily Kostich is dead.

885
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,320
Oh, yeah?

886
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,680
He says he knows who did it.

887
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,880
He says he knows
where the body is.

888
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:22,080
He says he wants more money than
I think the information is worth.

889
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,240
That so, Dode?

890
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,720
So walk. What's the info
have to do with you, anyways?

891
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,040
- Plenty.
- Plenty, he says.

892
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,080
And he wants cash on the nail.

893
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,000
That's a pot-skulled reef-worm with
more hop in his head than blood.

894
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:42,120
- Why pay for dirt you can't believe?
- No. You'll believe this.

895
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,320
- Maybe you will.
- No, you will.

896
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,280
'Cause it's someone close
to you. Real close.

897
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,800
Maybe it's hot, but it's Dode.
You can't trust it.

898
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,240
Real close.

899
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:08,600
I'm not getting my shoes wet for
this. Let him milk you if you want.

900
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,720
Stay.

901
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,840
It's still too much.

902
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,560
No, it isn't. You won't
complain when you hear it.

903
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,680
So maybe you should.

904
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,440
You had her up against
the wall with the brick.

905
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,240
I know my business.
It's still too much.

906
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,280
No, it isn't, 'cause that's
not why she was killed,

907
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,640
but it's real important
to you,

908
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,320
'cause the person
who killed her is real close.

909
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,600
'Cause he's got a lot to lose.

910
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,480
And he knows if I don't
bury him by spilling to you,

911
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,360
I spill to the bulls
and I bury him for real.

912
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,840
And he's really,
really scared.

913
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,320
She had a kid in her,
and he couldn't stand it!

914
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,600
Tug, it's all right!

915
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,800
Tug, stop!

916
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,920
Tug!

917
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:31,960
Tug.

918
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,040
She sprung it on me,
just...

919
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,040
It's a hell of a thing
to spring on a guy.

920
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,240
I don't remember much.

921
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,440
Laura talked me down after.

922
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,360
Said whatever...

923
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,360
She knew her,
said it wasn't true.

924
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,760
But I still think sometimes.

925
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,680
I think

926
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,680
about it being true,

927
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,920
about it being mine.

928
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,040
Maybe I did it

929
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,520
'cause I thought it was true.

930
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,320
It's a hell of a thing.

931
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,640
- You up?
- What's the stats?

932
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,880
Everyone's just laying low.

933
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,360
You're here with us now,
at my folks' place.

934
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,200
Everyone's assuming it's war.

935
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,200
No one's said anything, yet.

936
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,760
Everyone's laying low.

937
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,080
War?

938
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,120
- You're with us.
- The hell I am.

939
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,080
All right, I'm with you.

940
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,040
So just lie low.
Sleep some more.

941
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,960
Laura, she said
you should sleep.

942
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,360
<i>- Brendan?
- Yeah.

943
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,520
<i>Are you... What... Man,
have you heard about Dode?

944
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,560
<i>- I was there.
- You...

945
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,920
Where were you
yesterday? I called.

946
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,720
<i>Kasprzyk took my phone, turned
it off. I just now got it back.

947
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,360
<i>- All right, listen.
- Are you okay?

948
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,720
Just listen.

949
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,240
<i>- Is my name in the papers with the story?
- No.

950
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,880
All right. Is it just
Dode's name in the papers?

951
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,960
<i>Yeah. What do you mean?

952
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:43,000
Listen, I'm gonna be calling
you tonight, probably late.

953
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,800
So sleep with your phone on. Could
you get a car if you needed to?

954
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,960
<i>- If it's late enough I could take my mom's.
- Be ready then. I'll call.

955
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,680
Brendan, did you
hear about Dode?

956
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:57,080
You scheming tramp.
You set that poor kid up.

957
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,800
You held Dode like a card till
you could play him. For money!

958
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,440
I don't know what
you're talking about.

959
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,960
You'd bury me at the same time,
but it was mostly for the money.

960
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,280
You got Dode thinking Em had
his kid, thinking I did it,

961
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,240
and that was enough for him,
but he stuck to the money,

962
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,600
'cause you had
your claws in him!

963
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:14,880
'Cause he couldn't come away from the
deal without it and make you happy!

964
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,920
Brendan, I think you just need
to just sit down for a second.

965
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,120
I think you're just
a mess right now.

966
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:24,200
Can you please, sweetheart, could you
go run and get my shoes from my locker?

967
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,480
Still wish you knew
what you wanted to know?

968
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,280
You know, if it's any consolation,
it probably wasn't Dode's kid.

969
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,560
It might have been Tug's kid.
Frankly, I wouldn't bet a horse.

970
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:48,440
It was kind of a crowded field there
at the end, if you know what I mean.

971
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,040
Meanie.

972
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,200
- What are you doing?
- Showing your ace.

973
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,080
Far enough.

974
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,840
Everyone's paying
social calls.

975
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,240
So what are the stats?

976
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,240
- The stats are war.
- Tug got hot. He panicked.

977
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,000
Tug's been after my digs
from the get-go.

978
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,560
No, he's been anxious, 'cause he
thought if you found out he killed Emily,

979
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,680
you'd turn him over.

980
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,360
- He was right.
- Yeah, well.

981
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:33,760
I told him to get this straight,
no roughing. I wasn't even there.

982
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,240
All right, so he's a hothead. So
you don't want him on your side.

983
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,600
At least let's have a pow-wow
before we start digging trenches.

984
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,080
Maybe we can all walk away
amiable enemies.

985
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,560
Yeah, all right.

986
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,440
- Four o'clock.
- Tomorrow?

987
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,360
Tonight. Let's clear it all
before it boils up again.

988
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,680
Wait!

989
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,960
I'll drive you back.

990
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,080
So here's the sit.

991
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,760
You and The Pin
are gonna pow-wow, tonight.

992
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,120
Four o'clock, his place.

993
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,040
Bring all the muscle you want,
you won't need it.

994
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,080
He wants to talk straight,

995
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,080
and you're gonna work with him
for whatever he needs.

996
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,000
- 'Cause you don't want war.
- The hell I don't.

997
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,880
The Pin's sitting on the brick
profits. Hitting him now would be post.

998
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,960
Make peace,
wait for your chance.

999
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,280
He's right, Tug.
Smooth it out.

1000
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,200
Besides, he's got you
on the Dode thing.

1001
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,320
War will mean you versus him
and every bull in the burgh.

1002
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,000
Yeah, we'll talk.

1003
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,240
- You going?
- Yeah.

1004
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,400
Go away.

1005
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,440
I'm sorry, Brendan.

1006
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,840
I'm so sorry.

1007
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,640
Don't go tonight.

1008
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,520
I gotta make sure
everything plays out smooth.

1009
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,920
It'll play out however it
plays, without you there.

1010
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,760
I gotta make sure.

1011
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,160
Why?

1012
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,560
'Cause if there's war,
I'm in it, too.

1013
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,720
I'm just scared.

1014
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,680
If things go bad tonight...

1015
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,640
Just be careful.

1016
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,280
- Your folks left a car here?
- Yeah.

1017
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,040
Take it and Laura's.
I'll go first in yours.

1018
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,120
The hell you'll take mine.

1019
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,680
The scenic route.
Draw off any tailers.

1020
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,400
They'll think it's you, might
even radio back you're alone.

1021
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,800
Mr. Smarts.

1022
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,800
You got a cigarette?

1023
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,880
- I don't smoke.
- I've seen you smoke.

1024
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,280
I don't smoke cigarettes.

1025
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,400
Give me 15 minutes, then go.

1026
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:46,840
Write this down.

1027
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,040
I'm gonna be out of
The Pin's by 4:15.

1028
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:52,440
So at exactly 4:15, you put an
anonymous call into the bulls.

1029
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:55,920
You tell them there are drugs
in the trunk of the black Mustang

1030
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,360
outside The Pin's house.

1031
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,640
<i>- Can you get the car?
- Yeah.

1032
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:03,200
All right, after you call the
cops, go to Tug's house. 12 Elm.

1033
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,760
Park outside and wait.
Laura's inside.

1034
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,080
She hasn't got a car, but if she blows on
foot or gets a pick, tail her. All right?

1035
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,320
<i>- All right?
- Okay.

1036
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,600
I'll call you
when it gets light.

1037
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,000
Thanks, Brain.

1038
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,320
Talk!

1039
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,840
I want full assurance that any heat
from Emily and Dode is on just you.

1040
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,880
I don't even want my name
pulled into the shindig.

1041
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,320
Second, you owe me six C's.

1042
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,120
No rush.

1043
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,840
But I want your shake that they'll
be home in not too much time.

1044
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,120
That's square.
You did them, after all.

1045
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,520
Lay low, it'll blow over.
Stick on this,

1046
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:45,120
one of you will dish it to bury
the other. You'll both get the rap.

1047
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,200
As for the six,
did you borrow it?

1048
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,800
Yeah.

1049
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,560
Then you owe it. Shouldn't
need a shake on that.

1050
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,040
All right to both. Good. Let's
seal it up and blow for keeps.

1051
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,200
Third thing,

1052
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,400
the last brick...

1053
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,040
It's yours.

1054
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,520
That's not the point.

1055
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,840
I'm gonna start selling it.

1056
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,080
How do I know it's not bad?

1057
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,840
- Why would it be?
- Why was the last one?

1058
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,240
Because someone got greedy.

1059
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:18,440
Tug here's had the means to swipe half
of it and cut it bad for a long time.

1060
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,680
Now we're splits, the loss
of my trust is retroactive.

1061
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,720
- Did you, Tug?
- No.

1062
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,640
- All right, let's shake and blow.
- Not good enough.

1063
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,960
What would be good enough?

1064
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,240
I want to see him dose it,
just to prove it.

1065
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,400
Then we're square.

1066
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,400
Hell for that. I didn't
touch your junk! That's all!

1067
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,920
- I wanna see it.
- To hell!

1068
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,440
Your not wanting to dose, it's
proving something to me right here.

1069
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,920
Oh, it better be.

1070
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,440
It's telling that I ain't
under your thumb no more!

1071
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:51,680
That I ain't playing lapdog
to no gothed-up cripple!

1072
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,520
I'll dose it.

1073
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:57,920
What?

1074
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,880
If that'll shut you two
apes up, I'll take the dose.

1075
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,280
If I don't die,
we're all right as rain.

1076
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:04,720
Deal?

1077
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,520
Fine.

1078
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,720
Tangles.

1079
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,800
Johnny, go with him.

1080
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:29,320
<i>Where is it? Where's the brick? What's
happening? What did you do with it?

1081
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,800
<i>I didn't touch the brick.
You better give it back.

1082
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,800
What's happening?

1083
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,120
- Cops?
- No.

1084
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,200
The brick...

1085
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,000
The brick is gone.

1086
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,400
Make peace, huh? Talk it out?

1087
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,320
Get your boys in my den
so you could snag it under my nose!

1088
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,480
- No, it's not that!
- Was it bad, Tug?

1089
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,280
Snag it so I don't know, or
sell it off to flat the war odds!

1090
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,640
You're right! I really did
all that! Pin, think about it!

1091
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,600
Tug, no!

1092
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,360
Brendan!

1093
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,360
No!

1094
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,600
Help me!

1095
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,120
No! No!

1096
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,200
Brendan! Please!

1097
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,920
Please help me.

1098
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,000
<i>It's the cops!

1099
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,240
<i>- Cops!
- Help me.

1100
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,400
Brendan, please.

1101
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,440
<i>- Hey, where are you?
- Library. Where are you?

1102
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,040
Did she blow last night?

1103
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,680
<i>No, stayed there until 6:30,
then walked to school.

1104
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,400
<i>- You didn't give her a ride, did you?
- No.

1105
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,800
<i>- She came to school, straight from Tug's?
- Yeah.

1106
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,400
<i>- She there now?
- Yeah.

1107
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,000
<i>Not with me, but here.

1108
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,960
All right, tell her I wanna meet
up on the field in half an hour.

1109
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,280
Then go home, get some sleep.

1110
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:26,720
<i>Will do.

1111
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,640
Did you see it all?

1112
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,080
With The Pin and Tug?

1113
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,760
No, I took your advice
and didn't go.

1114
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,240
No?

1115
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,440
What happened?

1116
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,520
The papers say six dead,

1117
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,760
three around the house,

1118
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,240
girl in the back of Tug's car,
and The Pin and Tug.

1119
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,360
Yeah?

1120
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:45,200
Tug tried to shoot his way out
when the police got there.

1121
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,000
They tied him to Dode, too.
Same gun.

1122
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,600
And the girl.

1123
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,040
Huh.

1124
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:58,160
- Well, it's a good thing you weren't there.
- Yeah.

1125
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,720
Do you think
the girl was Emily?

1126
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,920
Probably.

1127
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,040
You loved her.

1128
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,760
Yeah, I did.

1129
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:21,480
You did all of this
because you loved her.

1130
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,040
And now it's finished.

1131
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,400
No.

1132
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:30,600
What?

1133
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,960
It's not finished.

1134
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,880
Tug pulled the trigger on Em,
and he got the fall for it.

1135
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,840
But the bulls could have
found that out without me.

1136
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,840
I set out to know who put her in the
spot, who put her in front of the gun.

1137
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,080
That was you, angel.

1138
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,760
What are you talking about?

1139
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,520
It was you.

1140
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,200
- Brendan.
- What?

1141
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:04,160
You want the whole tale?
You want me to tell it to you?

1142
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,240
Tell it to me.

1143
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,280
All right, from the top.

1144
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,520
You had your fingers in
Brad Bramish for appearances

1145
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,840
and to keep him buying from The
Pin, who you were hooked with.

1146
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,040
When Emily came to you and Brad,
you saw her for what she was,

1147
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,480
an insecure little girl
trying to get in.

1148
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,440
She goes on the back burner.

1149
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:33,440
Meanwhile, maybe you're getting
bored, or maybe just greedy,

1150
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,920
but when The Pin scores big with
the bricks, you take your shot.

1151
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,600
You hook one, take half, cut it back
to size, but you cut it back bad.

1152
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:43,200
Maybe accidentally, maybe to down
The Pin's operation, doesn't matter.

1153
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:47,400
You put it back. Poor Frisco
doses off it and lands in a coma.

1154
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,760
So now The Pin's fuming,
maybe he's jealous of Brad,

1155
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,640
so he comes to Brad's car looking
for blood, or at least a scape.

1156
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:57,000
You're in big trouble. There's
gonna be a war over this.

1157
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:01,560
And there's Emily. She
trusts you. She wants in.

1158
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,160
- It's duck soup.
- No!

1159
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,440
You frame her for the bad
brick, then you cut her loose.

1160
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,360
You turn on your heel
and bite her in the throat.

1161
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,560
Last week at the payphone,
Del Rio and Sarmentoso,

1162
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,280
she saw something
she was scared of.

1163
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,600
Tug's car driving by,
The Pin riding shotgun.

1164
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:16,120
But she wouldn't have
seen The Pin.

1165
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,160
No, she was across the street, angel.
She saw the driver's side. She saw you.

1166
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,960
She saw you, and she ran
like she saw some devil.

1167
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:25,280
Brendan, why...

1168
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,920
She took the hit, Dode hid her
away, but The Pin was on to her.

1169
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,360
He tracked her down and told her
to meet, that they'd make good.

1170
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:33,360
He gave her a time and a place and
sent Tug. Just to get the straight.

1171
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,520
But maybe you had talked Tug
up. Or maybe he just blew a fuse.

1172
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,520
But when Em sprung it on him
that she had her kid,

1173
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,280
he did what anyone could
count on Tug doing.

1174
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,920
He hit her.

1175
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:46,120
She took the hit for you,
and you let her take it.

1176
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,360
- Stop! Stop!
- That's the tale.

1177
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:50,320
- Are you gonna tell me it's not?
- Stop it. It's not.

1178
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,560
Will you tell me it's not?

1179
01:36:58,760 --> 01:36:59,920
It's not.

1180
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:06,560
It isn't true.

1181
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,000
I hope it isn't.

1182
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,800
I want you to have been
on my side all along,

1183
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,480
not just trying
to get me under your thumb,

1184
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,640
like Brad and The Pin and Tug.

1185
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,120
But I think you knew
that party was gonna blow up.

1186
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,200
I think that was
your final play.

1187
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,640
But I hope I'm wrong.

1188
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:36,000
I hope everything
I wrote in the note

1189
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:39,520
that I dropped at Gary Trueman's
office this morning is wrong.

1190
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:43,440
About your and Brad's
involvement in The Pin's runnings.

1191
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,520
And I hope you didn't steal the
brick last night in your purse.

1192
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,360
I didn't.

1193
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,480
Good.

1194
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:59,320
That means you didn't let me
walk into a slaughterhouse.

1195
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,560
And you didn't lead The Pin and Tug
and their crews to the slaughter.

1196
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:08,760
And when Trueman reads my note,
takes my cue and searches your locker,

1197
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,200
he won't find a damn thing.

1198
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:27,600
Brendan,

1199
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,560
don't do this.

1200
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,080
It's done.

1201
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,520
Done?

1202
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,120
Well, that's most of it.

1203
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,760
Nine out of 10.

1204
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:56,400
I told Em to tell
Tugger it was his.

1205
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,040
Told her it would
soften him up.

1206
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,800
She said she wished she could keep
it, but she didn't love the father.

1207
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:11,840
I was gonna drive her down
to the doctor the next day.

1208
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,840
Most wouldn't.

1209
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,040
She was already
starting to show.

1210
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,920
Three months.

1211
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,400
Do you know whose kid
that makes it?

1212
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,320
Or have you known all along?

1213
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,040
Mother...

1214
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,600
- You get your straight?
- Yeah.

1215
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:58,040
- I wouldn't have, if I...
- It's all right.

1216
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:03,720
Chuck Burns came to. The knife
guy. He spilled it all to the bulls.

1217
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:07,680
Turns out Brad Bramish hired him on
his own. It was just a grudge thing.

1218
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,240
Fits.

1219
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:13,280
You did good, Brain. Go sleep.

1220
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,760
Yeah. You, too.

1221
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,160
What'd she whisper to you?

1222
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,840
She called me a dirty word.

1223
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,440
All right,
you don't have to tell me.
