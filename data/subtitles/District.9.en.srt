1
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,315
A virus, a selective virus.

2
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:02,100
Release it near the aliens.

3
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:46,947
They can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you.

4
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,898
They check the brand and take them.
They take whatever you have on you.

5
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,822
Your cell phone or anything.

6
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:53,812
After that, they kill you.

7
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,961
Fuck off!

8
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,443
No, it's not my house.
I don't live here.

9
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,024
Yes! It is my house!

10
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,384
What is eviction?

11
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,048
You put the money here first.

12
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:45,576
You don't get anything until you pay.

13
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,286
What are you trying to do?
I'll chop your balls off.

14
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:27,897
Some of the guns are small.
But if it shoot you, it make a big mess.

15
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,174
No, not them!

16
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,604
Look! I found some!

17
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:01,548
I told you before,
this is human technology...

18
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,048
...it is useless.

19
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:05,748
Only our technology
contains the fluid.

20
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,913
That is not our technology?

21
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,023
No, it's junk.

22
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,242
Keep looking.

23
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,712
I find something.

24
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,647
Yes. This is what we need.

25
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,188
Good, little one.

26
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:29,376
Get down.

27
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,288
Careful. Wait.

28
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,157
There.

29
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:47,252
Why must it take so long?

30
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,890
Because it is very difficult...

31
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,126
...so much can go wrong.

32
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,798
Twenty years of work.

33
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,298
Our plan is ready now?

34
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,496
Quiet. Listen.

35
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:16,482
They are coming.

36
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,097
You must hide this...

37
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,498
...they must not find it.

38
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,377
Answer the door and be polite.

39
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,625
No! You take it.

40
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:50,097
This place is swarming with MNU.
I will be searched.

41
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,198
I must get back to my son.

42
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,967
Don't make them angry. Be polite!

43
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,125
Nobody is here.

44
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,326
No.

45
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,121
That's not mine.

46
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,698
No.

47
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,904
No. No.

48
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,498
Look, I fix it...

49
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,698
...l make it work.

50
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,215
I told you not to touch that.

51
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:53,097
What is wrong?

52
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:56,705
Nothing. Go outside
and watch for humans.

53
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,491
Where is your friend?

54
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:01,474
He's gone.

55
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,208
Inside, go! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

56
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:12,941
What do you want?

57
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,044
I know.

58
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:21,713
Why am I being evicted?

59
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,813
Yes?

60
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,733
It says you must give
me 24 hours notice.

61
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,499
This isn't legal.

62
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:40,442
No.

63
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,938
Yes.

64
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:14,673
You keep away from my child!

65
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:21,298
It's a silver cylinder.

66
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:22,795
I can't find it.

67
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,597
We must find it.

68
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,936
It contains the fluid.

69
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,198
It's not here.

70
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,959
It has to be, keep looking.

71
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,420
We trade for 10,000 cans.

72
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,674
Give them one hundred cans.

73
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,894
Yes, yes, but we take all of them now.

74
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,361
Get them the cat food. Hurry up.

75
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,998
Fuck off! Go!

76
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,373
Hey, friend, not you. You stay here.

77
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:28,338
- What do you want with me?
- We just want to talk.

78
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:31,183
Talk about what?

79
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,761
Stupid prawn.
They'll believe anything.

80
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:44,148
I pay you next week, I promise.

81
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,097
No money, you get nothing.

82
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:48,786
Fucking prawn, this isn't a charity.

83
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,273
You!

84
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,112
What do you want?

85
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,994
You have to go.

86
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,460
Yes! Yes!

87
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:08,653
No, get back.

88
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,434
Please, just go. Leave us alone.

89
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:42,382
Nothing. You must hide
somewhere else.

90
00:55:56,876 --> 00:56:01,632
Only one thing that
could make that happen.

91
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:06,398
Quick, we have to hide him.

92
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,900
Now you, get down there.

93
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,338
Where's the fluid?
What did you do with it?

94
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,277
You took it.

95
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:35,597
I know you did.
I can see what's happening to you.

96
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,061
Tell me where it is.

97
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:47,284
Yes, that's it. Yes!

98
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:07,458
You ruined everything.

99
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:37,159
Fuel goes in here!

100
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,731
That's enough! Quiet!

101
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,398
Then we fly away.

102
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,115
I said quiet! We cannot trust him.

103
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,927
Never mind.

104
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,471
Too bad. I could've fixed you.

105
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:06,673
Forget it.

106
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,389
It doesn't matter, it's too late.

107
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:22,097
We have medical machines on the
mother ship that can fix you. Yes.

108
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:25,592
We can use this ship to fly up there.

109
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,597
I don't have fluid.

110
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:39,440
I could fix you and I could fly away.
But I don't have fluid.

111
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:51,974
It took 20 years to
collect that amount.

112
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,635
Yes.

113
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:13,217
He likes you.

114
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,275
We are the same.

115
00:59:27,702 --> 00:59:29,418
There is a way out of this.

116
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,782
We get the fluid back from MNU.

117
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,751
The transformation is accelerating.

118
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,231
You do not have much time.

119
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,210
How many moons does our planet have?

120
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,596
Seven.

121
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,920
This planet only has one.

122
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:07,197
I can't wait to see our planet.

123
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:09,172
It is bigger than this one, isn't it?

124
01:03:09,175 --> 01:03:10,623
Enough.

125
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,588
We go home now?

126
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:18,563
Not home. No.

127
01:03:19,699 --> 01:03:23,134
This is where we must go.

128
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,498
See that tent there?

129
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,943
That might be ours.

130
01:03:28,449 --> 01:03:30,637
I want to go home!

131
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:37,916
We can't go home. Not anymore.

132
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,126
We go up to the mother ship.

133
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:02,829
Yes.

134
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:27,003
You said it was a suicide mission.

135
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,097
Maybe you were right.

136
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,893
We have no weapons.
They'll shoot us on sight.

137
01:06:57,324 --> 01:06:59,123
I want the arm. Cut it off.

138
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,229
I understand.

139
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,386
Fuck!

140
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,875
I thought you said not to kill them?

141
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,320
What is this place?

142
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:07,900
What do they do in here?

143
01:13:05,449 --> 01:13:07,609
What do we do now?

144
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:13,627
I thought you had a way out?

145
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,939
I have an idea.

146
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,274
Follow me.

147
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,967
Making a bomb!

148
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,422
Let's go!

149
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:49,865
Go! Drive!

150
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,875
Go down and initiate
the binary commands.

151
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:12,614
To do what?

152
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:16,510
It's going to take a bit
longer than I thought.

153
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,015
Three years.

154
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,274
Yes. Three years.

155
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:39,826
I will fix you but first
I must save my people.

156
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,052
I will not let my people
be medical experiments!

157
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,898
I must go home and get help.

158
01:15:55,899 --> 01:15:59,403
I must use all the fluid
to travel quickly.

159
01:16:05,475 --> 01:16:09,042
I will come back. I promise.

160
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,096
Father!

161
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,194
In there.

162
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,744
Father.

163
01:18:08,574 --> 01:18:09,735
Father!

164
01:19:39,925 --> 01:19:41,145
My son!

165
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,219
My son's in there!

166
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,609
Bring him to me.

167
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:22,252
I can't, it's too far.

168
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:40,681
Are you hurt?

169
01:33:09,699 --> 01:33:13,970
No, we stick together.
I'm not leaving you here.

170
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:23,136
I will come back for you.

171
01:33:26,699 --> 01:33:29,364
Three years, I promise.

172
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,103
We go home now?

173
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,480
Yes.
