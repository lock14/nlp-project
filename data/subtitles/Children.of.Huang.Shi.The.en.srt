1
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:03,307
lf you're not back here by 9:00
tomorrow night, l'll go without you.

2
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:04,468
Okay.

3
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:11,968
Good luck, Eddie.

4
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:50,057
Okay. Okay. Okay. l'm sorry. Okay.

5
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:38,348
<i>Writing from a ruined building.
A truckload of Japanese troops outside.</i>

6
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:42,848
<i>The city is quiet.</i>

7
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:54,468
l liked Tokyo very much.

8
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:57,637
l was there for three months...

9
00:04:57,768 --> 00:05:00,057
l met some nice people.

10
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,427
They were... very kind.

11
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:13,557
China. So many things to draw.

12
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:15,968
But l draw very badly.

13
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:19,598
Would you care for more tea, Mr. Hogg?

14
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:21,927
l'm fine, thank you.

15
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,468
You are safe now.

16
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:13,927
What's your name?

17
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,718
What is your nationality?

18
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:22,848
British?

19
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:26,677
-And you're a journalist?
-How did you know that?

20
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:28,968
Nobody but a journalist
would walk into Nanjing

21
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,598
armed with nothing but a sports coat.

22
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:35,718
What is this place? What's going on?
Who are you?

23
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:37,098
lt's the Tax Office.

24
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:39,557
And my name is Chen. Hansheng Chen.

25
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:42,598
-Hansheng Chen?
-Call me Jack, why don't you.

26
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,598
So, why were they going to kill you?

27
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:50,557
The Japs usually
leave British nationals alone.

28
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,768
-l saw something l shouldn't have.
-Got it.

29
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,387
l took photographs. They found them.

30
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:56,177
No wonder.

31
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,137
Pardon my ignorance,
but what are you doing in the Tax Office?

32
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:00,307
They're killing people out there.

33
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:02,137
We are completely outnumbered here,

34
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:06,387
and the Japs are better armed,
so we are going to fight another day.

35
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,137
Hold this.

36
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:13,268
But before we go,
we're going to blow up a few buildings.

37
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,137
They are very orderly, the Japanese.

38
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,848
They hate it
when we blow up a city's records.

39
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:23,518
Thank you.

40
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:36,217
We'll try for the British consulate.

41
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,427
They may be able to get you out of Nanjing.

42
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,768
You have to leave.

43
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:44,057
You have to tell the world
what's happening here.

44
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:47,967
l love this part.

45
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:59,888
Come on. Your friends should be this way.

46
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,717
Take it easy, Daisy.

47
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,427
l have a pass.

48
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,638
-l have a pass in my pocket.
-Shoot him!

49
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,927
There's nothing we can do.

50
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,467
-Shoot him!
-You're too reckless, George.

51
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:41,807
Shoot him.

52
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,967
Shoot him.

53
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,518
Shoot him.

54
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,138
Hey.

55
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:51,638
You were hit pretty bad.

56
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:55,268
Was l? l didn't feel a thing.

57
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:58,347
Must've been the cold numbing the pain.

58
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:00,967
Most of your blood's
gone down the Yangtze.

59
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:03,638
But l decided you'll live.

60
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:08,717
l hope you're going to thank him
for saving your life.

61
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:10,467
Thank you once again.

62
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:13,018
She was talking to me. Right, Lee?

63
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:17,347
So, you're an Oxford man.

64
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,467
-What?
-You talk a lot in your sleep.

65
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:22,057
What about you?

66
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:25,597
You didn't learn your English at Berlitz,
if l may say so.

67
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:27,217
West Point.

68
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:28,967
l thought you were a Communist.

69
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:31,307
l am. Figure it out yourself.

70
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:35,557
And when you do, you will understand
much more about China.

71
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:43,427
l never thought of you as the kind
to pick up strays.

72
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:45,888
Not male ones, anyhow.

73
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:48,347
l can't just dump him out here, can l?

74
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:51,427
Well, he won't be up to much
for at least a month.

75
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:54,097
l can't get him back to Shanghai.

76
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:55,638
So, Miss Pearson,

77
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:59,388
tell me what in God's name l'm going to do
with a six-foot Oxford graduate

78
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,967
who can't speak a word of Chinese.

79
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:13,927
Jack! Have you ever heard of
a place called Huang Shi?

80
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:19,177
You know, l came back to China
to teach engineering.

81
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:22,217
Now l'm teaching peasants
how to blow things up.

82
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:25,268
To tell you the truth, it's much more fun.

83
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:26,888
Seriously?

84
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:30,097
Seriously.
l travel around to organize the resistance,

85
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:33,217
and try to stay ahead of the Japanese army.

86
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:36,638
-l have to leave tomorrow.
-Take me with you.

87
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:40,807
How fit do l need to be to use a typewriter,
for God's sake?

88
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,847
l'm not worried about you.

89
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:46,717
l'm worried about the poor bastards
who have to carry you around with them.

90
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:50,967
But there is a place up in the northwest.
lt's called Huang Shi.

91
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:54,177
lt's somewhere you can pick up
good background material

92
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:56,847
and work on your Chinese
while you are convalescing,

93
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:59,177
before you go on to the front.

94
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:07,307
-Very good.
-Did you understand it?

95
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:09,097
l certainly did.

96
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:13,807
You said, ''Let me introduce myself.
l am a pumpkin.''

97
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:23,307
This area is controlled by the Communists,
this by our Nationalist brothers-in-arms.

98
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:26,427
You will take the train as far as Baoji here,

99
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,557
and Huang Shi is right about here.

100
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:30,677
That's where you're going.

101
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,307
-Chen?
-Hey! Get down!

102
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,717
What's the matter?
They're not the Japanese.

103
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:44,057
No. They are not.

104
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:45,847
They're the government troops
of Chiang Kai-shek.

105
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,638
-Nationalists?
-Yeah.

106
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:49,717
-l thought you were brothers.
-Sometimes.

107
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:53,018
l thought you were fighting together
against the Japanese.

108
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:55,307
When it suits them or us.

109
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:59,768
This could be one of those times.
Or maybe not.

110
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:07,177
-What are they doing here?
-They are conscripts from the south.

111
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:11,677
They like to take them far from their homes,
so they are less likely to run away.

112
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:36,057
They're trapped.

113
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:28,057
Hello?

114
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:41,217
Hello?

115
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:45,217
Hello!

116
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:55,638
Who's in charge here?

117
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:08,468
This is for the person in charge.

118
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:14,218
l said this is for the person in charge.

119
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:17,137
Esteemed Headmaster...

120
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:20,637
l have the pleasure of introducing...

121
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:25,018
the great Oxford University scholar...

122
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:26,807
George...

123
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:28,768
Pig.

124
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:34,468
l am in charge, Mr. Pig.

125
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:39,427
-Hogg.
-lt says Pig.

126
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:44,768
How is it you speak English?

127
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:47,427
l'm not a peasant like these others.

128
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:50,927
l am Liu Shi Kai.
My father is a government official.

129
00:17:55,637 --> 00:17:57,137
What's he want here?

130
00:17:57,218 --> 00:18:00,268
-Food, maybe.
-What a joke.

131
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:08,768
You think l can cook with just a pot?

132
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,637
Come and see...

133
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:17,137
l have nothing... look.

134
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,468
All l have is this.

135
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:32,347
Grown-ups.

136
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:34,307
Teachers.

137
00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:36,137
Where?

138
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:39,718
Gone... all gone.

139
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,927
Do you have any rice?

140
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,387
Get up.

141
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:09,678
Who's there?

142
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:34,177
The boys have taken the Englishman.

143
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:47,718
That's enough!

144
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,768
Touch him again...

145
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:55,018
l'm out of here forever.

146
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:56,807
She's bluffing.

147
00:20:56,847 --> 00:21:00,807
You give me one good reason
why l should be bluffing, Shi Kai.

148
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:13,928
What's the matter with them?
They're like animals.

149
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,218
How long have you been in this country?

150
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:19,268
-Five weeks. And you?
-Five years.

151
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:24,637
-Here. Let me take a look at that.
-You're the nurse, aren't you? Lee.

152
00:21:25,178 --> 00:21:27,637
-Lee Pearson.
-How do you do? l'm George.

153
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,468
l know who you are.

154
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:32,637
lt was my idea to send you here.

155
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,018
The great Oxford University scholar.

156
00:21:50,387 --> 00:21:53,718
Jack Chen has given you
quite an introduction here.

157
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:57,057
Except he's called you Mr. Pig.

158
00:21:57,557 --> 00:21:59,468
lt's not that funny.

159
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:07,678
He's a very nasty bit of work, that one.

160
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:09,807
l can't think why.

161
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:13,428
He only saw his father beheaded,
his mother raped and beheaded,

162
00:22:13,518 --> 00:22:15,807
his sister raped and beheaded.

163
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:19,307
After that, they lined him up
on the edge of a pit to be machine-gunned.

164
00:22:19,347 --> 00:22:20,387
He's a smart kid.

165
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:22,218
He waited until he felt
the guy next to him get hit.

166
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,768
Stop. Please.

167
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:27,678
-Nanjing. l was there.
-Jack told me.

168
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:29,518
That's why l thought you'd be good here.

169
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:31,597
You're going to need a Chinese name,
you know.

170
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:33,718
One they can actually say.

171
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:36,637
Hogg. Ho-Ke.

172
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:39,557
You're out of your mind
if you think l'm staying here.

173
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:42,387
l didn't come halfway round the world
to play nanny to a bunch of savages.

174
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:43,968
-Okay.
-So in the morning,

175
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:46,807
if you'd kindly point me
in the direction of the war and l'll be off.

176
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:48,597
l said okay.

177
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:53,018
Why do they give you such a wide berth?

178
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:57,218
Out here people die all the time,
typhus, cholera, tetanus.

179
00:22:57,807 --> 00:23:00,218
Anyone gives me any trouble,
l just tell them,

180
00:23:00,307 --> 00:23:03,057
''One day you graze yourself.
You'll think it's nothing.

181
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:07,428
''Next day you wake up with a fever.
You think it's a cold. That's all.

182
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:12,807
''Pretty soon your bones ache,
your jaw locks, your teeth clamp together

183
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:17,387
''and slowly, very, very slowly,
you die of tetanus.''

184
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:19,968
ln my bag l have vaccines
when l can get them.

185
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:22,637
lf l go, the bag goes with me,

186
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:26,178
so who's going to mess with me?

187
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:29,097
Why don't they just close this school
and send the boys home to their families?

188
00:23:29,137 --> 00:23:30,518
This isn't a school.

189
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:33,677
-lt looks like a school.
-This is an orphanage.

190
00:23:34,268 --> 00:23:36,927
Every one of them has a story,
just like Shi Kai's.

191
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:40,097
Now you want to find your war, Mr. Hogg?
Look around.

192
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:41,597
Because they don't need a teacher.

193
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:46,307
What they need is someone who can
make them care whether they live or die.

194
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:04,268
The beds are crawling with lice.

195
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:06,887
-The kids are, too.
-How adorable.

196
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:10,307
No joke. Body lice carry typhus.

197
00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:14,597
Okay. Now for the boys.

198
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:17,057
What are you going to do? Boil them?
Jolly good!

199
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:18,468
Flea powder.

200
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,428
l haven't been able to get my hands
on any before.

201
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:25,178
But the thing is to figure out how to
make them understand it won't hurt.

202
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:27,637
l'm sure you'll manage.

203
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,807
Ho-Ke has lice on him.

204
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,427
Scratch.

205
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:38,768
The lice could make him sick.

206
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:43,768
This powder will kill the lice

207
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:47,968
but will do no harm to him.

208
00:24:49,677 --> 00:24:51,057
Smile.

209
00:24:53,597 --> 00:24:55,637
So Ho-Ke is very happy.

210
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:58,307
Now take off your clothes.

211
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:02,597
Oh, for Pete's sake,
it's nothing l haven't seen before.

212
00:25:15,678 --> 00:25:16,968
Hands.

213
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:11,268
No lice.
We won't have to shave your head, too.

214
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:12,557
ls that a promise?

215
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,518
You're not vain, are you, Mr. Pig?

216
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:17,887
l hadn't thought so. Christ. What now?

217
00:26:18,347 --> 00:26:20,137
-Coffee.
-Coffee?

218
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:24,968
-Here's to you, George.
-l haven't had real coffee since Shanghai.

219
00:26:25,057 --> 00:26:28,097
-So, why China?
-Because it's in trouble.

220
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:31,637
Because everyone back home
is waiting for the shoe to drop,

221
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:33,347
waiting for the next war.

222
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:36,347
lt's like being stuck in a cellar
waiting for a storm to break.

223
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,637
l went to the States first.

224
00:26:38,718 --> 00:26:41,218
Hitchhiked across the country twice.

225
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:44,597
But they're hunched down in their
bunkholes even deeper than we are.

226
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:48,218
''War? What war, mister?
We're in a depression here.''

227
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:53,807
And so then l went on to Japan,
learned some Japanese.

228
00:26:53,887 --> 00:26:56,597
And they'll tell you
they don't want war either,

229
00:26:56,637 --> 00:26:58,307
just ask them.

230
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:02,387
And then l went to Nanjing.

231
00:27:03,097 --> 00:27:05,557
And l saw unspeakable things.

232
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:09,218
l begged Jack Chen to kill a man.

233
00:27:10,468 --> 00:27:12,887
l never knew l had hate like that in me.

234
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:15,807
Everybody feels hate sometimes.

235
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:17,807
No. Not us.

236
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:21,678
You see, my family are pacifists.

237
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,057
And not just your quiet, normal,
private pacifists. Oh, no.

238
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:27,968
They're famous for it.

239
00:27:29,518 --> 00:27:31,637
My mother had Gandhi to tea.

240
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:36,018
And my father went to jail
during the last war.

241
00:27:37,218 --> 00:27:39,518
He's the bravest man l know.

242
00:27:41,177 --> 00:27:43,468
And now l think they're wrong.

243
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:46,637
l think there are times one must fight.

244
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:50,137
Other people fight and die,

245
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:55,968
and there l am at my typewriter,
only l seem to have misplaced that now, too.

246
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:13,178
You saved lives today, George.

247
00:28:13,218 --> 00:28:15,968
You sure didn't look like much of a hero,
and l bet you didn't feel like one.

248
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:19,518
But you know what? lt worked just fine.

249
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:40,968
Couldn't sleep?

250
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:43,637
Me neither.

251
00:28:44,427 --> 00:28:48,427
One of the kids had the runs.
God-awful mess.

252
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:52,637
-You can keep the mule, by the way.
-You're leaving?

253
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:55,307
l've got a bunch of medical stations to run.

254
00:28:55,347 --> 00:28:58,177
l only stopped off to bring you that grain.

255
00:28:58,268 --> 00:29:01,387
My guess, it'll last you about three weeks.

256
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:03,847
After that,
you'll have to try to find them something.

257
00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:06,718
-lt's up to you.
-But when will you be back?

258
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:09,428
-May.
-But this is March!

259
00:29:09,518 --> 00:29:11,178
They're like kids anywhere, George.

260
00:29:11,268 --> 00:29:13,847
They need to be warm, safe, clean and fed.

261
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:17,097
Now, if you can manage even one of those,
you'll be ahead of the game.

262
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:19,887
Now, you listen to me. l'm not staying here.

263
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,097
-You find someone else!
-There is no one else.

264
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:24,178
You have to stay, George.

265
00:29:30,557 --> 00:29:31,887
Bugger.

266
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:27,307
lt keeps the wind out.

267
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:30,057
Rip it off.

268
00:32:04,218 --> 00:32:06,097
You. Come and help me?

269
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,968
Yes, you.

270
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:10,928
Come.

271
00:33:02,768 --> 00:33:05,137
Ho-Ke? Ho-Ke?

272
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,928
Hogg. My name is Hogg.

273
00:33:11,847 --> 00:33:13,347
-Ching.
-Ching.

274
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:25,268
l'm writing a sort of letter.

275
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:26,718
l'll be with you in a minute.

276
00:33:33,518 --> 00:33:35,677
Hey, stop that.

277
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:41,097
What's the matter?

278
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,018
Taba. Taba.

279
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:49,927
Taba.

280
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:54,718
Table. lt's a table.

281
00:33:55,218 --> 00:33:58,137
Table. Table.

282
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:01,018
-Table, table, table, table!
-Okay. Okay.

283
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:09,967
Chair.

284
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,268
Chair.

285
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,768
Student.

286
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:18,467
Student.

287
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,927
Student.

288
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,018
That's you.

289
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:27,887
Teacher. l guess that means me.

290
00:34:31,057 --> 00:34:32,847
Student. Teacher.

291
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:35,268
l'm looking for Merchant Wang.

292
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,597
Where would l find Merchant Wang?

293
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:15,467
Please excuse my poor house, Mr. Hogg.

294
00:35:15,557 --> 00:35:18,137
lt has fallen on evil times.

295
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,347
The war?

296
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:23,717
War. Revolution. Also gambling.
Also opium.

297
00:35:24,677 --> 00:35:28,518
So many ways to spend money
and to get nothing in return.

298
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:31,597
l take only solid currencies.

299
00:35:31,677 --> 00:35:33,768
lf you can only pay in Chinese dollars,

300
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:37,018
then the price, l'm afraid,
will have to double.

301
00:35:37,597 --> 00:35:40,097
l should like to pay in vegetables.

302
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:43,637
Vegetables are solid currency.

303
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:49,557
-English humor.
-You advance us the food and the seed,

304
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:50,927
we do all the work.

305
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:53,137
You take your share of the harvest.

306
00:35:53,177 --> 00:35:55,018
Crops fail, Mr. Hogg.

307
00:36:03,217 --> 00:36:04,807
What is this?

308
00:36:07,887 --> 00:36:10,467
Durham wheat. Last year's harvest.

309
00:36:14,518 --> 00:36:18,467
Red lentils. l shouldn't think
they'd do well in this climate.

310
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,137
We can do business.

311
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:27,967
Please come again, Mr. Hogg.
And send my regards to Miss Pearson.

312
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:29,557
Yes, of course.

313
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:51,717
l hope you're having fun, Yu-Lin.

314
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:04,347
Nothing will grow.
You're doing it wrong.

315
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:46,268
lt's good to be back.

316
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:48,717
l'm sure you'll be pleased.

317
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:51,347
Wei-Ping.

318
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:57,467
Say it in English. This is a dog.

319
00:38:58,807 --> 00:39:00,518
Dog.

320
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,097
Dog.

321
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:07,467
Dog.

322
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,268
-Dog.
-Dog.

323
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:11,637
Dog.

324
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:15,717
-Dog.
-Dog.

325
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:19,768
Don't be afraid.

326
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:21,637
-Dog.
-Dog.

327
00:39:21,717 --> 00:39:24,177
-Dog.
-Dog.

328
00:39:24,717 --> 00:39:26,137
Dog.

329
00:39:36,137 --> 00:39:37,807
Shi Kai! Don't!

330
00:39:55,597 --> 00:39:57,097
Shi Kai.

331
00:39:58,427 --> 00:40:01,137
You won't be able to save him, you know.

332
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:05,137
You might be able to limit
the damage he can do.

333
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,137
No more.

334
00:40:09,018 --> 00:40:12,018
You never told me
what brought you here, Lee.

335
00:40:12,307 --> 00:40:15,768
Freedom, l guess. And what happens?

336
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:19,967
l end up in a dark hovel
with centuries of soot falling on my head

337
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,137
doing an amputation by candlelight.

338
00:40:22,177 --> 00:40:23,427
You're a surgeon, then?

339
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:25,217
When a man's dying of gangrene,

340
00:40:25,307 --> 00:40:28,467
he tends not to check
the letters after your name.

341
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:33,018
When there's no one else,
you do what has to be done.

342
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,807
l'm not really a nurse, either. Just like you.

343
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:39,137
You're not really a teacher.

344
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:43,807
We're all something different in China.
That's why we came.

345
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:46,177
l was supposed to be
an army wife in Manila,

346
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:48,467
but l couldn't play bridge.

347
00:40:49,177 --> 00:40:51,597
Funny how life works out.

348
00:40:55,347 --> 00:40:57,018
What on earth?

349
00:40:57,097 --> 00:40:59,217
lt's my one treasure.

350
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:00,967
-Do you dance, George?
-No.

351
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:03,137
Oh, come on. Sure you do.

352
00:41:28,387 --> 00:41:30,427
lt's good to see you, Lee.

353
00:42:06,847 --> 00:42:10,137
-Are you going to stay?
-l think so.

354
00:42:11,427 --> 00:42:13,427
Awhile. And you?

355
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:17,097
l think so.

356
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:19,018
Yes.

357
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:45,387
Lo San.

358
00:42:45,637 --> 00:42:48,097
He needs something to eat.

359
00:42:49,518 --> 00:42:52,057
l don't cook for dirty little pigs.

360
00:43:01,217 --> 00:43:02,557
Thank you.

361
00:43:06,427 --> 00:43:08,597
You know nothing!

362
00:43:08,677 --> 00:43:11,177
You stupid Gansu peasant.

363
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:45,637
Now, let's take a look at this.

364
00:43:52,307 --> 00:43:54,427
Now let me see here...

365
00:43:56,427 --> 00:43:58,137
That's horrible.

366
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:00,307
Brush your teeth every day.

367
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:01,597
You, too.

368
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:04,807
-Ching.
-You'll do just fine.

369
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:06,217
Just fine.

370
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:18,307
All her things

371
00:44:20,807 --> 00:44:23,347
to the new room.

372
00:44:23,887 --> 00:44:26,518
She'll be pleased.

373
00:44:30,597 --> 00:44:31,807
Here.

374
00:44:32,677 --> 00:44:35,217
We'll get some flowers.

375
00:45:08,097 --> 00:45:10,018
<i>''Though I am old with wandering</i>

376
00:45:10,097 --> 00:45:12,967
-''Through hollow lands and hilly lands,''
-Ho-Ke...

377
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:18,268
''l will find out where she has gone,
And kiss her lips and take her hands,

378
00:45:19,518 --> 00:45:22,557
''And walk among the long dappled grass.''

379
00:45:25,427 --> 00:45:26,677
Ching?

380
00:45:28,137 --> 00:45:30,347
Hey, hey, hey...

381
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:36,967
lt's all right. You're safe.
Nobody's going to hurt you, Ching.

382
00:45:48,557 --> 00:45:49,717
Goats?

383
00:45:50,768 --> 00:45:53,887
Are you crazy?
They'll eat more than the milk they give.

384
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:57,927
They're for clearing ground.
My mother was a great gardener.

385
00:45:58,018 --> 00:46:01,427
-She had goats.
-Don't you ever touch my things.

386
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:04,927
l'm sorry.
l thought you'd be more comfortable.

387
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:06,927
Well, you thought wrong.

388
00:46:08,427 --> 00:46:10,268
Where are you going?

389
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:15,847
Okay then, when will you be back?
Don't be so ridiculous!

390
00:46:16,717 --> 00:46:19,387
You can't just leave! Lee!

391
00:46:59,807 --> 00:47:01,557
How's Uncle Jing today?

392
00:47:01,637 --> 00:47:04,967
His tumor is worse, and he wants more pipe.

393
00:47:05,018 --> 00:47:06,847
lt'll kill him now.

394
00:47:07,518 --> 00:47:09,887
Maybe that won't be such a bad thing.

395
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:14,557
l heard today, the Nationalists have
found a solution to the opium problem.

396
00:47:14,637 --> 00:47:18,768
-They're going to behead all the addicts.
-l heard the same thing.

397
00:47:19,307 --> 00:47:21,967
Addicts and people who deal in opium.

398
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:26,097
The Japanese behead you
for being Chinese.

399
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:29,887
So, Miss Pearson, what can l do for you?

400
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:37,467
l was hoping
you might have some sulfa powder.

401
00:47:37,518 --> 00:47:41,097
Nobody's got sulfa powder,
not even the Japanese.

402
00:47:44,057 --> 00:47:48,217
lt will be sad for your friend.
Nobody to talk to but those boys.

403
00:47:49,057 --> 00:47:52,307
-l think he will be lonely.
-l think he'll be just fine.

404
00:47:52,387 --> 00:47:55,217
You say that because you are never lonely.

405
00:47:56,637 --> 00:47:59,807
Well, you should go visit him,
if you think he's so lonely.

406
00:47:59,847 --> 00:48:03,807
l don't have time for the problems
of people with no problems.

407
00:48:04,518 --> 00:48:05,807
What do you have in the way of morphine?

408
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:14,967
-That's all you've got?
-No. But you're not my only customer.

409
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:20,557
Take opium instead.

410
00:48:21,018 --> 00:48:23,268
You know what they say about opium.

411
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:26,768
You still feel the pain,
but it doesn't hurt anymore.

412
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:50,597
Six months ago,
they were filthy, starving, diseased

413
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:54,018
and of no value to anyone, and now...

414
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:57,307
l'm very impressed.

415
00:48:57,387 --> 00:49:00,717
l have to confess, Mr. Hogg.
l did not think you could do it.

416
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:04,018
l have to confess, Mrs. Wang, neither did l.

417
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:10,637
l hope you will do me the honor
of accepting a small gift.

418
00:49:17,177 --> 00:49:20,637
Good Lord, it's in English.
Where did you get it?

419
00:49:22,097 --> 00:49:25,967
A missionary gave it to me
for being a very good girl.

420
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:31,637
<i>The Silk Road.</i>

421
00:49:33,177 --> 00:49:37,387
lt was the link between the East and West
for more than 2,000 years.

422
00:49:38,387 --> 00:49:40,927
-lt seemed appropriate.
-Thank you.

423
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:46,637
May it seal our friendship.

424
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:49,097
Yes.

425
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:24,347
-Where have you come from?
-Lingbao.

426
00:50:24,427 --> 00:50:25,427
Lingbao?

427
00:50:25,518 --> 00:50:27,927
We've walked for two days.

428
00:50:39,677 --> 00:50:43,637
Don't worry, they often fly over.

429
00:50:44,018 --> 00:50:47,097
-What's his name?
-Number Four.

430
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,307
Lao Si?

431
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:50,967
And they are... Let's see.

432
00:50:51,307 --> 00:50:52,307
Number One.

433
00:50:52,768 --> 00:50:53,768
Number Two.

434
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:55,387
Number Three.

435
00:50:55,768 --> 00:50:56,768
Number Four!

436
00:53:03,467 --> 00:53:06,137
Try to sleep.

437
00:53:14,967 --> 00:53:16,967
Oh, Lao Si.

438
00:53:17,057 --> 00:53:18,097
Ching?

439
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:19,137
He's too young.

440
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:25,387
Good night.

441
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:47,057
Not wounded!

442
00:53:53,427 --> 00:53:55,717
Not wounded! Get him out of here!

443
00:53:55,807 --> 00:53:57,967
Get him something to eat!

444
00:53:59,347 --> 00:54:03,347
We've had 40, no, 50 guys in here today

445
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:07,097
who are nothing but piles of bones
held together by their uniforms.

446
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:09,887
They're dying of hunger,
not gunshots, Jack.

447
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:12,387
The Nationalists
are starving their own army.

448
00:54:12,467 --> 00:54:15,597
-What's the point of our being here?
-None.

449
00:54:15,637 --> 00:54:18,057
They are letting the Japs have Lingbao.

450
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:20,677
l've been ordered to evacuate.

451
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:23,427
Well, my wounded
won't survive being moved.

452
00:54:23,518 --> 00:54:25,637
Take the ones that will.

453
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,467
Why are you taking off your uniform?

454
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:37,177
l thought l'd stick around a little longer,
prepare a little welcome for the Japs.

455
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:56,967
l'll make them as comfortable as l can.
You know that.

456
00:55:07,467 --> 00:55:09,177
Be careful.

457
00:55:20,637 --> 00:55:21,807
Jack!

458
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,137
Don't waste our morphine.

459
00:56:13,807 --> 00:56:16,637
Leave him.

460
00:56:17,347 --> 00:56:18,768
He's dying.

461
00:56:23,557 --> 00:56:26,307
He's already dead.

462
00:57:18,717 --> 00:57:22,018
-George.
-My God. Chen!

463
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:25,637
Chen!

464
00:57:28,018 --> 00:57:30,057
Have you pissed yourself?

465
00:57:30,677 --> 00:57:33,137
Oh, Jesus. He's wet the bed!

466
00:57:36,217 --> 00:57:37,717
How is she?

467
00:57:39,387 --> 00:57:40,717
Exhausted.

468
00:57:40,927 --> 00:57:42,137
Lingbao.

469
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:45,557
lt was pretty bad. l was lucky.

470
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:49,637
She got out before the worst.

471
00:57:51,347 --> 00:57:53,637
Will the Japanese get this far?

472
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:57,387
Maybe. Maybe not.

473
00:57:58,427 --> 00:58:01,717
The trouble is,
l've seen what happens when they do.

474
00:58:56,427 --> 00:58:58,927
Hello. Can we come in?

475
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,557
Who's this?

476
00:59:04,467 --> 00:59:05,807
-Hello, Ching.
-Hello.

477
00:59:05,847 --> 00:59:08,467
And this is Lao Si.

478
00:59:08,768 --> 00:59:11,137
l saw a wolf, but l didn't cry.

479
00:59:11,217 --> 00:59:13,137
Oh, my goodness.

480
00:59:15,347 --> 00:59:16,677
Coffee?

481
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,347
-And steamed bread, with honey.
-Honey?

482
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:24,717
Come on, Lao Si.

483
00:59:24,807 --> 00:59:27,887
He'll have that bread off you,
if you as much as blink.

484
00:59:28,137 --> 00:59:31,597
His main objective in life
is greater rotundity.

485
00:59:35,217 --> 00:59:39,137
-ls this all right with you?
-lt's fine.

486
00:59:40,637 --> 00:59:41,717
Ching.

487
00:59:42,768 --> 00:59:44,677
-Bye, bye.
-Bye, bye.

488
00:59:47,847 --> 00:59:48,967
Lee.

489
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:54,018
Jack Chen is here.

490
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:56,807
He's been sick for the last week.

491
01:00:06,347 --> 01:00:08,467
You're impossible, you know.

492
01:00:09,137 --> 01:00:11,427
l thought you were dead as dirt.

493
01:00:11,847 --> 01:00:14,768
lt's malaria. He's had it for years.

494
01:00:15,097 --> 01:00:19,018
They all have it.
He'll be on his feet in no time.

495
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:22,637
They've put a price on your head, you know.

496
01:00:22,717 --> 01:00:25,387
Oh, yeah? How much?

497
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:28,847
-Ten thousand yuan.
-l say, Jack.

498
01:00:29,097 --> 01:00:31,467
That's about thirty bucks, US, George.

499
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:35,717
-That hurts my feelings.
-lt's a fortune around here.

500
01:00:37,807 --> 01:00:43,217
<i>We'll fight the Japanese
with swords and guns</i>

501
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:48,018
<i>We'll fight the invader
with all our might</i>

502
01:00:49,137 --> 01:00:50,807
-Six.
-Six.

503
01:00:52,557 --> 01:00:55,637
-Seven.
-Seven.

504
01:00:58,637 --> 01:01:02,097
We've got Nationalist visitors.
Stall them if you can.

505
01:01:07,347 --> 01:01:09,137
Quietly, quietly.

506
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:17,427
The Japanese are advancing
and are very close.

507
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:20,637
lf our Nationalist forces
withdraw from Xi'an,

508
01:01:20,717 --> 01:01:24,427
we'll get orders to take over
this entire estate for military use.

509
01:01:27,137 --> 01:01:30,597
Then may l conclude
you have not got the order yet.

510
01:01:33,177 --> 01:01:37,137
Well, gentlemen,
if that's all, you may leave now.

511
01:01:37,177 --> 01:01:39,637
l have many things to do.

512
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:52,518
Oh, one more thing.

513
01:01:52,637 --> 01:01:54,268
Those laborers...

514
01:01:55,597 --> 01:01:58,307
We have no laborers here.

515
01:01:58,347 --> 01:01:59,967
Only children.

516
01:02:00,097 --> 01:02:02,717
-Children?
-This is a school for orphans.

517
01:02:04,518 --> 01:02:06,057
ls this true?

518
01:02:06,137 --> 01:02:07,768
Are they boys?

519
01:02:15,768 --> 01:02:17,927
l'm not a Communist.

520
01:02:18,018 --> 01:02:19,597
l'm only a teacher.

521
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,427
l just want to educate my boys.

522
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:27,347
Missionaries, Communists, the Japanese...

523
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:30,347
One foreign infection after another.

524
01:02:30,677 --> 01:02:32,557
lt's been over 100 years.

525
01:02:32,887 --> 01:02:35,467
Now it's finished.

526
01:02:36,807 --> 01:02:39,637
You can no longer take our blood.

527
01:02:39,717 --> 01:02:42,177
Our sons!

528
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:46,557
Your boys?

529
01:02:47,307 --> 01:02:50,467
They are not your boys, Mr. Hogg.

530
01:02:51,137 --> 01:02:54,387
Their blood belongs to China.

531
01:03:14,307 --> 01:03:17,467
We're agreed?
You can't go back on your word.

532
01:03:30,717 --> 01:03:33,268
Let him out.

533
01:03:34,137 --> 01:03:36,097
Mr. Hogg. You are free.

534
01:03:37,518 --> 01:03:39,097
How much did that cost?

535
01:03:39,177 --> 01:03:42,427
Only slightly more
than what l think you are worth.

536
01:03:43,467 --> 01:03:44,807
Thank you.

537
01:03:45,847 --> 01:03:47,927
lf they decide to call me a Communist,

538
01:03:48,018 --> 01:03:50,768
they'll close the school,
and they'll conscript the children.

539
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:52,137
Of course.

540
01:03:52,217 --> 01:03:55,387
And l'm afraid
it will only be a matter of days.

541
01:04:00,057 --> 01:04:01,557
Stay here.

542
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:11,887
Go. Just go!

543
01:04:20,887 --> 01:04:23,467
-What was all that about?
-Bandits.

544
01:04:23,557 --> 01:04:26,057
There's no one to control them nowadays.

545
01:04:26,137 --> 01:04:29,807
They claim they have opium to sell,
but the packages are full of dirt.

546
01:04:29,887 --> 01:04:32,677
Maybe it would be safer not to sell opium.

547
01:04:32,807 --> 01:04:35,217
Safe? Nothing is safe.

548
01:04:35,717 --> 01:04:39,268
You neither.
You have all those strong soldier boys.

549
01:04:39,637 --> 01:04:43,057
You are like a farmer
with too many fat, juicy sheep!

550
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:06,347
So where do you propose we take them?

551
01:05:06,427 --> 01:05:09,887
-Up the Silk Road.
-Through the mountains?

552
01:05:10,097 --> 01:05:13,768
With snow and children, at 10,000 feet?

553
01:05:15,018 --> 01:05:18,927
-That's insane.
-Actually, l mean to take them further,

554
01:05:19,137 --> 01:05:20,768
beyond Lanzhou.

555
01:05:22,307 --> 01:05:24,307
Have you ever heard of Shandan?

556
01:05:24,677 --> 01:05:26,807
Shandan's on the edge of the Gobi Desert.

557
01:05:26,847 --> 01:05:29,387
lt's about 700 miles from here.

558
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:33,427
Seven hundred miles.
Hogg, there's probably nothing there.

559
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:38,518
Exactly. There's nothing there.
Nothing anybody could possibly want.

560
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:41,387
Somewhere they'll be safe.

561
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:45,097
Chen will come with us
as far as the Yellow River.

562
01:05:45,137 --> 01:05:48,307
Then he'll turn off
and join his Communist pals in Yen-an.

563
01:05:48,347 --> 01:05:50,347
-What about you?
-What about me?

564
01:05:50,597 --> 01:05:52,097
Will you go with Jack,

565
01:05:52,177 --> 01:05:55,307
or will you stay with us
and head for Shandan?

566
01:05:55,387 --> 01:05:57,597
ls that what you're asking me?

567
01:05:57,847 --> 01:05:59,807
He's got fire in his belly, that one.

568
01:05:59,887 --> 01:06:02,347
l would like to take him with me
when l rejoin my unit.

569
01:06:02,427 --> 01:06:03,427
No.

570
01:06:04,307 --> 01:06:07,307
-He's not a child.
-You're right. He's not.

571
01:06:07,887 --> 01:06:10,467
He hasn't been a child for a very long time.

572
01:06:22,057 --> 01:06:25,347
Yes. We were lovers once.

573
01:06:26,137 --> 01:06:28,847
lt didn't work out, so...

574
01:06:29,807 --> 01:06:31,677
Now we're friends.

575
01:06:31,768 --> 01:06:33,307
That works.

576
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:36,967
l guess l just didn't want enough from him.

577
01:06:37,967 --> 01:06:41,217
You fellows want so much to be needed.

578
01:06:41,307 --> 01:06:44,217
Everybody wants that, even you.

579
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:48,057
Me, especially.

580
01:06:50,847 --> 01:06:56,268
So what's it going to be?
Yen-an with him? Or Shandan with us?

581
01:06:59,677 --> 01:07:02,847
lf l had any brains, l'd stay right here.

582
01:07:11,597 --> 01:07:13,217
l believe in you.

583
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:16,518
l believe in each one of you.

584
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:19,927
You're the toughest people l've ever met.

585
01:07:21,177 --> 01:07:24,467
Heavens, you once scared the life out of me.

586
01:07:31,217 --> 01:07:33,518
lt's very hard to leave this place.

587
01:07:33,637 --> 01:07:35,057
l know that.

588
01:07:35,967 --> 01:07:39,268
But l want you to remember one thing.

589
01:07:40,268 --> 01:07:43,347
You've done all this by yourselves.

590
01:07:45,097 --> 01:07:48,177
You can do it all again.

591
01:07:50,268 --> 01:07:54,217
You can do it anywhere.

592
01:08:23,637 --> 01:08:27,677
Wound dressings.
Captured from the Japanese.

593
01:08:28,717 --> 01:08:32,097
Each one of them
contains a single, sterile dressing,

594
01:08:32,677 --> 01:08:35,807
wrapped around a tablet of morphine.
Handy, huh?

595
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:39,717
No wounded for us. That's an order.

596
01:08:55,057 --> 01:08:58,018
No! No, l'll take that.

597
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:10,467
There's no point. We're leaving here soon.

598
01:09:17,018 --> 01:09:19,967
As long as we have something to trade,
we'll survive.

599
01:09:20,018 --> 01:09:21,807
Yes, l would say so.

600
01:09:21,927 --> 01:09:25,217
But, still, this is an ambitious enterprise.

601
01:09:25,807 --> 01:09:28,387
You are a remarkable man, Mr. Hogg.

602
01:09:28,637 --> 01:09:32,018
l have greatly enjoyed
doing business with you.

603
01:09:39,018 --> 01:09:40,597
This is your custom?

604
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:44,137
When we say goodbye to a great lady.

605
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:47,307
Well, goodbye, Mr. Hogg, and farewell.

606
01:10:26,677 --> 01:10:28,307
Come on, boys!

607
01:10:29,677 --> 01:10:32,927
Hang-Ger! Zuien-ze!

608
01:10:34,637 --> 01:10:38,268
Xiao Bang! Mang Si!

609
01:10:40,427 --> 01:10:43,427
Rou-Ding, Lao Tung?

610
01:10:43,597 --> 01:10:45,137
Muriel?

611
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:47,967
Lao Da?

612
01:10:48,018 --> 01:10:50,268
Lao San? Lao Er?

613
01:10:50,427 --> 01:10:52,018
Lao Si?

614
01:10:54,557 --> 01:10:57,057
Yu-Lin? Shi Kai?

615
01:11:00,847 --> 01:11:02,427
Yu-Lin!

616
01:11:04,518 --> 01:11:06,097
Yu-Lin!

617
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:26,597
Yu-Lin.

618
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:41,137
Yu-Lin? Yu-Lin.

619
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:44,597
lt's all right.

620
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:48,268
We'll make a new garden. l promise.

621
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,967
Yu-Lin?

622
01:11:55,847 --> 01:11:57,018
Yu-Lin?

623
01:12:06,137 --> 01:12:07,677
Ching...

624
01:12:46,467 --> 01:12:49,097
l thought he was happy. l really did.

625
01:12:49,518 --> 01:12:52,887
But we'll never know what went on
the last time he was happy.

626
01:12:53,347 --> 01:12:57,307
Maybe someone, his mother
or father or sister or whoever, said,

627
01:12:57,387 --> 01:13:00,177
''Ching, we have to leave here.''

628
01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:03,677
And then something happened,

629
01:13:04,137 --> 01:13:07,887
something so awful,
we can't even begin to imagine it.

630
01:13:10,347 --> 01:13:12,137
lt doesn't go away.

631
01:13:12,887 --> 01:13:15,677
lt never goes away, and l know that.

632
01:13:15,927 --> 01:13:19,268
But all of this, flowers and honey, and...

633
01:13:21,057 --> 01:13:22,387
l forgot.

634
01:13:24,427 --> 01:13:27,717
l'm sorry, Ching. l forgot.

635
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:39,717
Be quiet.

636
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:48,717
Come on, boys. Come on!

637
01:13:56,217 --> 01:13:59,057
Quiet, boys. That's it.

638
01:14:23,217 --> 01:14:25,887
lf the wolf wakes you, don't be afraid.

639
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:30,597
-Just tell him what l said.
-l know.

640
01:14:58,307 --> 01:15:00,768
Here, l'll take him.

641
01:15:02,268 --> 01:15:04,057
Come on, sleepyhead.

642
01:15:07,307 --> 01:15:08,768
Did you give that to him?

643
01:15:08,807 --> 01:15:11,887
Let him keep it, George. lt's who he is.

644
01:15:34,018 --> 01:15:36,847
There is an abandoned farmhouse
just the other side of the village.

645
01:15:36,927 --> 01:15:38,847
We can camp there.

646
01:15:38,927 --> 01:15:42,807
Also, he swears he saw
a couple of Japanese only two days ago.

647
01:15:49,427 --> 01:15:52,268
Shi Kai, go and sleep now. l'll take over.

648
01:15:54,637 --> 01:15:56,597
Shi Kai, did you hear me?

649
01:16:00,177 --> 01:16:03,137
They're there. l can smell them.

650
01:16:27,518 --> 01:16:30,097
Drop your guns!

651
01:16:34,307 --> 01:16:36,807
Drop your guns!

652
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,387
Now!

653
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:42,807
Shi Kai!

654
01:16:46,387 --> 01:16:48,177
Shi Kai! The door!

655
01:16:51,427 --> 01:16:53,677
-We have to kill them, you know.
-No.

656
01:16:54,137 --> 01:16:56,637
Don't be stupid, George. They are scouts.

657
01:16:56,807 --> 01:16:59,967
lf they get away, they will rejoin their unit.

658
01:17:01,557 --> 01:17:03,967
-l'll do it.
-l said no!

659
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,307
Where's Shi Kai?

660
01:17:25,967 --> 01:17:28,097
Have you seen Shi Kai?

661
01:17:29,847 --> 01:17:31,057
Where?

662
01:18:22,177 --> 01:18:23,677
Shi Kai!

663
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:48,097
When we reach the Silk Road,
l want you to leave us.

664
01:18:51,137 --> 01:18:55,057
Come on, boys! Keep moving!

665
01:19:02,677 --> 01:19:04,307
That's it.

666
01:19:21,427 --> 01:19:23,518
Keep up ahead.

667
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,427
Why did you stop?

668
01:19:29,018 --> 01:19:31,307
lt's a Japanese patrol.

669
01:19:31,347 --> 01:19:32,847
lt's okay.

670
01:19:38,597 --> 01:19:42,307
We're refugees.

671
01:19:42,387 --> 01:19:47,307
We're taking them North to safety.

672
01:19:47,518 --> 01:19:49,018
Your papers?

673
01:19:51,518 --> 01:19:54,967
We have no papers.

674
01:19:56,347 --> 01:19:58,967
Search their belongings.

675
01:20:13,347 --> 01:20:14,518
My God.

676
01:20:35,518 --> 01:20:37,268
Sir, look at this!

677
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:43,847
A Corporal Kurahara.

678
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:45,387
No!

679
01:20:46,057 --> 01:20:48,518
No! No!

680
01:20:51,807 --> 01:20:53,268
We found it.

681
01:20:53,347 --> 01:20:59,387
We found it on a dead soldier.

682
01:20:59,467 --> 01:21:04,677
He shouldn't have taken it.

683
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,557
He's just a child.

684
01:21:06,637 --> 01:21:08,268
Where did you find it?

685
01:21:11,717 --> 01:21:13,597
Shi Kai!

686
01:21:13,717 --> 01:21:15,268
Shi Kai!

687
01:21:16,217 --> 01:21:18,768
Put the gun down now!

688
01:21:20,177 --> 01:21:22,177
Quiet!

689
01:21:26,637 --> 01:21:28,097
Shi Kai!

690
01:21:29,307 --> 01:21:31,137
Shi Kai! The wagon!

691
01:21:38,717 --> 01:21:39,967
Shi Kai!

692
01:21:54,847 --> 01:21:56,268
We're moving on.

693
01:21:57,177 --> 01:21:58,717
Shi Kai!

694
01:22:31,467 --> 01:22:34,807
Lee, l thought you said
there was morphine in these.

695
01:22:37,518 --> 01:22:38,717
Lee!

696
01:22:42,807 --> 01:22:44,637
Lee! Where are you?

697
01:22:45,887 --> 01:22:47,927
-l'm here.
-Hurry up!

698
01:22:57,137 --> 01:23:00,807
-lt's all that's left.
-What?

699
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:33,597
He's sleeping?

700
01:23:38,717 --> 01:23:40,518
He won't wake up now.

701
01:23:41,637 --> 01:23:44,807
Sometime in the next hour or two, he'll die.

702
01:23:55,557 --> 01:23:57,057
Sleep, Shi Kai.

703
01:23:59,018 --> 01:24:01,137
Everything's all right now.

704
01:24:01,427 --> 01:24:04,677
Go find them. Okay? Go find your family.

705
01:24:05,268 --> 01:24:08,137
Sleep, sleep...

706
01:25:32,677 --> 01:25:36,387
lt's okay. Easy, easy.

707
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,887
You and l
have one thing in common, George,

708
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:17,177
we are both from good families.

709
01:26:17,387 --> 01:26:19,807
We have the luxury of our ideals.

710
01:26:20,887 --> 01:26:24,307
Lee, she is the one who's different.

711
01:26:25,518 --> 01:26:29,847
lt's never a matter of ideals to her,
but something deep in her gut.

712
01:26:30,427 --> 01:26:33,717
She can't look at these people
without feeling their pain.

713
01:26:33,847 --> 01:26:37,557
When it got too much,
she took opium to deal with her pain.

714
01:26:40,307 --> 01:26:43,137
Have you ever heard of ''the Bitter Sea''?

715
01:26:45,137 --> 01:26:47,307
lt's an old name for China.

716
01:26:47,768 --> 01:26:50,677
What we Chinese do best, is to endure.

717
01:26:52,137 --> 01:26:54,927
We try to keep our heads above water.

718
01:26:55,768 --> 01:26:57,137
That's all.

719
01:26:58,467 --> 01:27:01,057
While the Bitter Sea swirls around us,

720
01:27:02,268 --> 01:27:03,597
we endure.

721
01:27:04,268 --> 01:27:08,768
But, you know,
Lee's more Chinese than either of us.

722
01:27:08,847 --> 01:27:12,467
She doesn't believe in the future,
because like the Chinese,

723
01:27:14,018 --> 01:27:16,557
she doesn't think she deserves one.

724
01:27:26,927 --> 01:27:29,927
George, you're going to show her she does.

725
01:27:33,137 --> 01:27:35,347
You're still in love with her.

726
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:43,177
Not me. l'm otherwise engaged.

727
01:28:20,677 --> 01:28:24,427
You thought l was such a goddamn saint,
didn't you, George?

728
01:28:27,137 --> 01:28:28,847
Well, now you know.

729
01:28:33,057 --> 01:28:34,518
Now you know.

730
01:28:41,717 --> 01:28:44,018
Well, you're certainly no lady.

731
01:28:45,597 --> 01:28:48,347
You're a brave, beautiful woman.

732
01:28:50,677 --> 01:28:54,097
You're the bravest, most beautiful woman
l've ever met.

733
01:30:03,427 --> 01:30:05,467
Tell her goodbye for me.

734
01:30:50,967 --> 01:30:52,637
Come on, Lao Si.

735
01:31:05,057 --> 01:31:09,597
That's the Yellow River.
And just this side of it, Lanzhou.

736
01:31:51,347 --> 01:31:52,518
Stop!

737
01:32:51,307 --> 01:32:53,847
l am the Magistrate of Lanzhou.

738
01:32:54,887 --> 01:32:57,307
This is Mr. Chang Shengyi,

739
01:32:57,347 --> 01:32:59,097
the Chief of Police.

740
01:33:10,177 --> 01:33:13,268
You took more than 60 children,

741
01:33:14,307 --> 01:33:20,268
climbed over Liupan Mountain
and walked 500 miles.

742
01:33:21,887 --> 01:33:23,557
lt's hard to believe.

743
01:33:23,637 --> 01:33:24,847
But it's true.

744
01:33:24,927 --> 01:33:26,467
How long did it take?

745
01:33:26,557 --> 01:33:27,768
Three months!

746
01:33:30,217 --> 01:33:35,097
-You'll walk 200 miles more to Shandan?
-Correct.

747
01:33:45,217 --> 01:33:47,637
l won't allow you to walk to Shandan.

748
01:33:49,927 --> 01:33:52,177
lt's out of the question.

749
01:33:53,717 --> 01:33:56,387
l have four Dodge trucks.

750
01:33:58,518 --> 01:34:00,268
You can borrow them.

751
01:35:35,347 --> 01:35:38,637
Hogg, do you see that?

752
01:35:38,717 --> 01:35:39,967
Hogg?

753
01:35:41,307 --> 01:35:42,637
Hogg!

754
01:36:16,807 --> 01:36:18,967
ls everybody all right?

755
01:36:28,847 --> 01:36:31,637
-Hogg? Are you okay?
-Just a scratch.

756
01:36:36,307 --> 01:36:37,768
All right.

757
01:37:24,467 --> 01:37:27,967
My God, where have you brought us?
The 14th century?

758
01:37:48,807 --> 01:37:49,967
Look!

759
01:37:50,177 --> 01:37:53,807
There it is, beyond the watchtower.
Shandan.

760
01:38:36,807 --> 01:38:38,018
Thanks.

761
01:38:42,387 --> 01:38:44,967
l was told to find a building for you.

762
01:38:55,637 --> 01:38:58,637
This is called
The Temple of King Ashoka's Hair.

763
01:38:58,677 --> 01:39:01,717
The monks left
many years ago.

764
01:39:13,137 --> 01:39:15,097
Do you think it will do?

765
01:39:24,597 --> 01:39:27,518
Come on, boys. Time for bed.

766
01:39:31,177 --> 01:39:33,807
-Good night, boys.
-Good night.

767
01:39:33,887 --> 01:39:35,597
-Good night.
-Good night.

768
01:39:48,807 --> 01:39:50,768
Hey. Quick.

769
01:39:50,807 --> 01:39:53,387
What are you doing in here, pumpkin?

770
01:39:56,427 --> 01:39:58,177
You're getting so heavy!

771
01:41:21,637 --> 01:41:23,097
Coffee.

772
01:41:29,967 --> 01:41:33,677
-Where on earth did you find this?
-Surprise.

773
01:41:34,967 --> 01:41:38,347
l thought l'd lost it.
Untouched the whole way.

774
01:41:40,177 --> 01:41:41,637
Celebration.

775
01:41:45,717 --> 01:41:47,268
Are you all right?

776
01:41:47,557 --> 01:41:50,018
Flu, l think. Tired.

777
01:41:51,217 --> 01:41:54,518
Here. Drink this and l'll take a look at you.

778
01:41:56,427 --> 01:41:57,927
Actually, l...

779
01:42:01,177 --> 01:42:02,677
Hogg!

780
01:42:03,597 --> 01:42:04,807
Hogg?

781
01:42:07,807 --> 01:42:09,177
Rou-Ding.

782
01:42:09,268 --> 01:42:11,467
They'll have this in Lanzhou. Okay?

783
01:42:11,637 --> 01:42:12,637
We've run out of this.

784
01:42:12,717 --> 01:42:14,927
l know, Ho-Ke has tetanus.

785
01:42:15,847 --> 01:42:19,347
Okay, hurry! Please, hurry! Please! Hurry!

786
01:44:06,637 --> 01:44:08,807
-Hey.
-Lee?

787
01:44:09,347 --> 01:44:10,927
-Lee?
-Yeah?

788
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:16,307
-l'm not scared.
-No, of course not.

789
01:44:17,427 --> 01:44:20,807
Rou-Ding's coming with serum.
You're going to be fine.

790
01:44:21,018 --> 01:44:24,677
No. But it's all right.

791
01:44:27,137 --> 01:44:30,677
l don't like to be contradicted, Hogg.
You know that.

792
01:44:31,177 --> 01:44:34,427
l've been so lucky, Lee.

793
01:44:38,967 --> 01:44:41,097
l've been so lucky.

794
01:44:59,768 --> 01:45:01,717
Hold him tight. That's good.

795
01:45:09,677 --> 01:45:12,387
lt's okay, it's going to be okay.

796
01:46:12,347 --> 01:46:16,768
SHl-KAl

797
01:46:23,347 --> 01:46:24,717
Ching.

798
01:46:28,307 --> 01:46:30,097
CHlNG

799
01:46:53,967 --> 01:46:56,597
He came from a distant land

800
01:46:57,427 --> 01:47:00,557
but his spirit wished to stay here with us.

801
01:47:02,427 --> 01:47:04,887
Ho-Ke has not left us,

802
01:47:05,967 --> 01:47:10,347
because he gave himself to each of us,

803
01:47:11,637 --> 01:47:14,057
and whatever we do from now on,

804
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:17,927
we will always be able

805
01:47:18,967 --> 01:47:20,597
to hear his voice.

806
01:48:03,847 --> 01:48:04,927
Jack.

807
01:48:06,597 --> 01:48:08,217
Jack.

808
01:48:08,307 --> 01:48:10,427
l only found out a week ago.

809
01:48:10,637 --> 01:48:12,768
Somebody came from Lanzhou.

810
01:48:14,847 --> 01:48:17,137
-l'm fine, Jack.
-We need you.

811
01:48:17,637 --> 01:48:20,927
The boys are safe now.
They can manage on their own.

812
01:48:34,137 --> 01:48:36,927
Lee. l'm serious.

813
01:48:38,467 --> 01:48:42,307
Maybe these boys don't need me, Jack,
but l need them.

814
01:48:43,807 --> 01:48:45,807
Oh, yes, l do need them.

815
01:48:46,268 --> 01:48:51,057
l didn't pee the bed
because l'm a big boy now.

816
01:48:51,177 --> 01:48:53,018
lf the wolf comes,

817
01:48:53,097 --> 01:48:55,557
l'll say, ''Go away, stupid,''

818
01:48:55,637 --> 01:48:58,427
and he'll be frightened and run away.

819
01:49:04,557 --> 01:49:06,807
Ho-Ke says you can have that.

820
01:49:07,268 --> 01:49:09,347
l don't like coffee.

821
01:49:09,427 --> 01:49:12,057
Ho-Ke says you can have it.

822
01:49:16,137 --> 01:49:18,307
You're a brave boy, Lao Si.

823
01:49:19,637 --> 01:49:21,057
Brave boy.

824
01:50:08,807 --> 01:50:12,057
<i>The four of us
would never have survived without Hogg.</i>

825
01:50:12,137 --> 01:50:13,597
<i>That's certain.</i>

826
01:50:17,018 --> 01:50:20,018
<i>We brothers didn't know our birthdays.</i>

827
01:50:20,427 --> 01:50:23,137
<i>Even my older brother didn't know.</i>

828
01:50:23,768 --> 01:50:28,137
<i>When asked, we all say the 22nd.</i>

829
01:50:28,807 --> 01:50:31,967
<i>This was the day George Hogg died.</i>

830
01:50:37,557 --> 01:50:39,387
<i>Hogg gave a speech.</i>

831
01:50:39,467 --> 01:50:43,097
<i>He wrote three words
on the blackboard, in English.</i>

832
01:50:44,057 --> 01:50:46,467
<i>Where do we want to go,</i>

833
01:50:46,768 --> 01:50:49,557
<i>why and how.</i>

834
01:50:49,768 --> 01:50:51,637
<i>He had his methods.</i>

835
01:50:51,847 --> 01:50:57,807
<i>Then he explained how far it was
to Shandan, over 1,000 kilometers.</i>

836
01:50:59,137 --> 01:51:00,927
<i>We would march there,</i>

837
01:51:01,137 --> 01:51:05,807
<i>our belongings packed
on handcarts and mule carriages.</i>

838
01:51:11,467 --> 01:51:15,018
<i>We kept hearing that Shandan was so cold,</i>

839
01:51:15,097 --> 01:51:18,347
<i>that your nose would break off
if you touched it.</i>

840
01:51:18,967 --> 01:51:22,768
<i>And when you pee,
it would become an ice stick,</i>

841
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:27,097
<i>but Hogg assured us
it wouldn't be that bad.</i>

842
01:51:30,967 --> 01:51:33,137
<i>It was a very cold winter.</i>

843
01:51:33,217 --> 01:51:36,807
<i>And walking all the way
through snow and on icy roads,</i>

844
01:51:37,177 --> 01:51:39,467
<i>it took us over two months.</i>

845
01:51:40,097 --> 01:51:44,637
<i>Later, people called this
The Long March in Miniature.</i>

846
01:51:50,847 --> 01:51:52,717
<i>He was a perfect man.</i>

847
01:51:52,967 --> 01:51:57,967
<i>Everybody has his flaws,
but I couldn't find any in Hogg.</i>

848
01:51:58,427 --> 01:52:01,518
<i>He was always smiling when talking to us.</i>

849
01:52:02,177 --> 01:52:08,137
<i>He knew, and he taught us
what to hate and what to love.</i>

850
01:52:15,557 --> 01:52:18,768
<i>The Chinese people
remember those foreigners</i>

851
01:52:18,927 --> 01:52:21,768
<i>who helped China during those struggles.</i>

852
01:52:24,967 --> 01:52:27,597
<i>No matter how the world may change,</i>

853
01:52:29,057 --> 01:52:33,467
<i>we, the Chinese, will never forget them.</i>
