CHANGING TIMES

3
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:03,981
Where's everybody?

4
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,667
-You know, it's Sunday.
-What do you mean, it's Sunday?

5
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,592
You know we need
to get things moving.

6
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,413
Why aren't they working?

7
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:12,618
Let's go!

8
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:14,477
Hurry up!

9
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:17,514
Thank you.

10
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,102
Welcome to Tangiers.
I am Nabila Balouch.

11
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:26,794
Hello, Nabila.

12
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,478
-Did you have a good trip?
-Yes.

13
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:33,863
Things didn't go well in Marbella.
They disagree with the estimate.

14
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:35,857
Is that your only luggage?

15
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:39,631
Yes, I am not a tourist.
I am a traveler.

16
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,466
One of the issues we had
with this project

17
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,958
was to design
a perfectly insulated building.

18
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:51,367
It's only 550 yards from an airport
supporting big commercial airplanes.

19
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:55,750
So, the facade is insulated
with double-glazing windows,

20
00:03:55,858 --> 00:03:59,818
the interior has false ceilings
made of mineral flagstones,

21
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:03,565
and, for the most part, the stones
on the floor are carpeted.

22
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:05,553
Christian is better suited to tell you

23
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:08,945
how things are going inside
the building, on the technical side.

24
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:12,587
How does last minute information
get broadcasted live?

25
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,210
Where are the teleprompters
and the telexes?

26
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:16,262
Are they at the same level?

27
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,864
By the way,
you haven't forgotten the flowers?

28
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:19,660
A daily bouquet since last week.

29
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:22,576
-No signature.
-That's perfect.

30
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:23,786
Roses every time, right?

31
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,613
Yes, but you haven't
told me which color.

32
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:27,688
-I thought red was too daring.
-Be daring then, Nabila.

33
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:31,339
So light will go
through the window anyway?

34
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:34,256
Yes. There will be light,
but it will be dimmed.

35
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:38,412
Behind the window, we'll have blinds,
something like that.

36
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:41,131
This building
must be able to function 2 4/7.

37
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:41,833
Is it facing north?

38
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:44,458
Yes, it is facing north,
but its two main facades. . . .

39
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:47,660
<i>The land we have chosen</i>
<i>for MEDI 1 S A T</i>

40
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:51,787
<i>is located in the northwest area</i>
<i>of the Tangiers' Free Zone,</i>

41
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,351
<i>bordering the airport.</i>

42
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,873
<i>It has a surface</i>
<i>of 1 92,800 square feet,</i>

43
00:04:56,977 --> 00:05:00,273
<i>which gives us enough space</i>
<i>for our main building.</i>

44
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:02,344
<i>Construction and equipment</i>

45
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,976

46

<i>to insure the durability</i>

47
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:09,478

50
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:19,376
<i>In the western wing of the building,</i>
<i>an 820</i>-<i>square</i>-<i>feet set</i>

51
00:05:19,473 --> 00:05:22,954

52
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,513
<i>It communicates with a control room,</i>

53
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:30,505
<i>processing sound, image, light,</i>
<i>and external broadcasting.</i>

54
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,616
<i>Cecile, I don't want to show my face.</i>

55
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:44,561
<i>Or at least not yet.</i>
<i>I am afraid you won't recognize me.</i>

56
00:05:44,657 --> 00:05:46,118
It would be nice
if you closed your eyes.

57
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:47,632
That way you would only
hear my voice.

58
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,185
Every night, I hear yours
on the radio, I look at the city,

59
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,711
and to me,
you and the city become one.

60
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:55,152
Now, the moment has come to...

61
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:57,966
Shit. That's bad.

62
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:19,910
You cut your hair?
Good idea. You look better that way.

63
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:22,864
<i>With or without curls</i>
<i>My style is right</i>

64
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:26,605
You know, I didn't come alone.
I came with Nadia.

65
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:28,461
You could have told me.

66
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:30,765
I thought you would be happy
to know her. It's been so long.

67
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:32,654
Well, sure, but not like this.
You're impossible.

68
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:34,444
You put people
in front of the situation,

69
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:36,138
and you let them deal with it.

70
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:38,096
Anyway. It's all right.
Where is she?

71
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:39,884
She's afraid to come out.
Come on.

72
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:51,750
Hello, Nadia. It's very nice meeting
you. Better late than never.

73
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:53,831
Hello, Rachid. How old are you?

74
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,726
Nine and a half years old.

75
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:57,713
My name isn't Rachid, right, mom?

76
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,304
His name is Said.

77
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:03,115
I didn't know you were coming,
but let's celebrate.

78
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:06,151
Nadia came to see her sister.
Are you sure she's coming?

79
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:08,461
Of course she is. I'll wait for her.

80
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,896
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

81
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:17,414
I feel bad leaving you here.

82
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,495
I'm fine. Go ahead. Seriously.

83
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:21,903
We'll go have an orange juice.

84
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:36,208
I'm sure her sister won't come.
Do you mind if she stays with us?

85
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,575
Honestly, Sami, I would have preferred
if it didn't happen this way.

86
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:39,917
It's very simple. Just say yes or no.

87
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,610
I am the one who has to make
the decision?

88
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,306
Well, ask your father.

89
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,514
It won't be a problem, then.
He has always respected my freedom.

90
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:47,853
Right, and to you, freedom means
imposing your whims on others.

91
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:49,327
Don't start, please.

92
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:53,935
We'll end up doing what you want
anyway, as always.

93
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,872
I'll go get her, then.

94
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,016
Don't stay here. It's ridiculous.

95
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,633
Something must have come up.
It happens.

96
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:12,842
I have her cell phone number.
She'll answer the phone at some point.

97
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:15,879
Stop it, Nadia. You've been
leaving messages for a week.

98
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:17,479
If she wanted to talk to you,
she would have done it already.

99
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:19,854
Don't say that.
I know her better than you do.

100
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,164
Fine.

101
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,311
Meanwhile, come
to my parents' house. It'll be easier.

102
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,784
No way!
I've already told you that.

103
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,466
At least for tonight.
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

104
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,990
Where's the lady?

105
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,471
She's waiting for us in the car.

106
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:52,878
Is she your mommy?

107
00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:54,286
Yes, she is.

108
00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:56,108
Why did she call me Rachid?

109
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:58,118
She made a mistake.

110
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:00,781
What's her name?

111
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:03,047
Cecile.

112
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:21,071
It was a floating island, surrounded
by an indestructible bronze wall,

113
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,886
with a smooth rock pointed at the top.

114
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:25,358
Twelve children were in the palace.

115
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:29,002
They were born in Eole. Six boys
and six girls in their blooming youth.

116
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:31,047
What does "blooming" mean?

117
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:35,529
It means they were
opening like flowers.

118
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:36,527
Like you.

119
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,464
I am not an opening flower.

120
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:40,714
I'll continue reading.

121
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:43,850
On the island, Eole's daughters
had married his sons.

122
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:44,935
The most diverse meals...

123
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,602
Why aren't you coming?
Are you hiding?

124
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:51,561
I am not hiding.
I didn't want to interrupt.

125
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:54,513
It's 8:00 pm, anyway.
I have to run to the station.

126
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:57,544
I left the window open.
The eastern wind has calmed down.

127
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:58,729
But if you would rather close it. . . .

128
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,302
No, it's okay.

129
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:01,099
Above all, make yourself at home.
You promise?

130
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,183
Yes, madam.

131
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,623
Madam? Don't call me madam!

132
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:06,695
Come on, Nadia.
Don't be anxious like this.

133
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,557
I am very happy to have you here.

134
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:11,405
Good night, Said.

135
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,396
Well, I am going out for a bit.
Can you give me a ride to town?

136
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:17,544
If you want to.

137
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:20,396
See? I told you things
would go well with my mother.

138
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:23,083
She's overdoing it.
It makes me uncomfortable.

139
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:26,346
She's always distant, so she's making
an effort to be affectionate.

140
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:27,823
It comes off as clumsy.

141
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:32,167
Did you see? Your parents
put us in the same room.

142
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:34,345
So? We've slept together before,
right?

143
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:35,983
Okay, I'm taking off.

144
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:37,292
Already?

145
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:39,498
You didn't even unpack.

146
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:40,943
You want me to stay with you?

147
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,277
No, it's okay.

148
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:46,410
I feel a little uncomfortable to be
alone in this house with your father.

149
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,066
Don't worry. He doesn't talk much.
You don't even have to greet him.

150
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,365
-What is this?
-My toys.

151
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:59,119
We could give them to Said.
What do you think?

152
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,190
You don't want to dive in?

153
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:07,850
No, thank you.

154
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:18,601
Actually, I'll just walk.

155
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:21,574
Come on. Stay a little longer!

156
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,786
You're always running away.
Shouldn't we try to talk a little?

157
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:24,554
Talk about what?

158
00:11:24,657 --> 00:11:26,631
I don't know.
Talk about you, your life.

159
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:29,290
It's only normal.
You call once in a blue moon.

160
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:30,887
You're exaggerating.
I always tell you what's going on.

161
00:11:30,993 --> 00:11:34,157
I'm not mad at you, Sami.
I just want to understand.

162
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:35,151
There's nothing to understand.

163
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:37,322
What about Nadia? Said?
This is news to me.

164
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:41,286
I told you we lived together in Paris.
It's not a surprise, is it?

165
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,967
What time is your show?

166
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:46,414
In 1 0 minutes.
I'll never get there on time.

167
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:48,171
Just walk. I'll take the car.

168
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:52,685
I'll leave it on the parking lot.

169
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:55,173
No, keep it.
I'll take a taxi to go home.

170
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:05,681
You didn't tell me how long you were
staying, you and your friends.

171
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:06,791
Is ten days all right?

172
00:12:06,897 --> 00:12:08,009
Last time, you didn't last a week.

173
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:09,771
May I remind you
that you were never around?

174
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:12,328
You want people to be here,
and you're always somewhere else.

175
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:14,699
I hate you!

176
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:06,310
Wait a second!

177
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,303
Nadia?

178
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:40,585
Aicha?

179
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,149
Hold on.

180
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:47,048
I left a ton of messages.
You could have called me back.

181
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:48,875
Calling cell phones is expensive.

182
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:51,278
I can't afford it,
especially foreign cell phones.

183
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,164
So, are you here?

184
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,500
Yes, Sami took me
to his parents' house.

185
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,876
But I would much rather
stay at your place, because...

186
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:59,245
You can't stay at my place.
It's too small.

187
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:01,100
<i>Hold on.</i>

188
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:12,462
Nadia? Nadia?

189
00:14:21,648 --> 00:14:22,793
What's going on? Are you ill?

190
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,423
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>

191
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:26,186
So what's new with you?

192
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:27,946
<i>Not much.</i>

193
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:30,187
I need to pay for mom's
hospital treatment,

194
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:31,629
so I work overtime at McDonald's.

195
00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:33,157
I sleep. I work a lot.

196
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,452
What about you?
Did you bring your son?

197
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:40,716
Of course.
I can't wait for you to see him.

198
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:43,979
Please be discreet.
Don't come by my work.

199
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,672
They don't know I have a twin sister.

200
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:48,013
Besides, I don't want them to ask
questions about you or your life.

201
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:50,927
You know how people are over here.
This is not Paris.

202
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,675
Don't worry. What time do you get off?

203
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:55,947
<i>It depends. Never before midnight.</i>

204
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:58,251
That's late for a child.

205
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:06,990
Listen, I think we should do this
some other time.

206
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:10,055
What do you mean,
"some other time"?

207
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,680
I haven't seen you for six years,
and that's all you can say?

208
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:15,271
Listen, I just got off work.
I only get five hours of sleep.

209
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:16,903
I'm completely exhausted.

210
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:20,008
I understand that you're tired,
but still. . . .

211
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,261
Listen, Aicha.

212
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,523
If you don't want to see me ever
again, please be honest about it.

213
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,346
Well, okay, then. I'll be honest.

214
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:32,423
I don't feel so well, and I don't
have the strength to see you.

215
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:34,632
I am afraid it will hurt me.

216
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:38,124
I need to learn
how to live without you.

217
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:41,963
When I succeed,
I promise we'll see each other.

218
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:48,008
I'm sorry, Nadia. I love you
very much. I'll call you back.

219
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:29,258
You have oversized the structures.

220
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,662
We had to,
because of earthquake hazard.

221
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,313
-What level?
-Level three.

222
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,529
What's that?

223
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:38,826
Is this how far you got
with the drilling?

224
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,356
-Yes.
-Get going then.

225
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:41,708
We've already lost two weeks.

226
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:43,084
All right.

227
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:47,786
Look, here.

228
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:49,769
I trust you to get things moving.

229
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:51,694
Give me the number.

230
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:57,127
Okay. Let's check the measurement.

231
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:58,246
That's no good.

232
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,945
Follow me, my friend.

233
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:22,470
<i>To my wife and all my friends</i>
<i>in Algiers.</i>

234
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,037
<i>To my fiancé, Youssef,</i>

235
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,893
<i>who went to work for an insurance</i>
<i>company in Casablanca.</i>

236
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:29,806
<i>Dedicating this song to my love.</i>

237
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:32,937
<i>I want to dedicate this song to all</i>
<i>my friends who will recognize me.</i>

238
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,592
<i>Walid, Karim, Omar,</i>
<i>as well as my whole family.</i>

239
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:37,736
<i>Even if I don't see them often</i>
<i>because we're far away,</i>

240
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,148
<i>I hold them close to my heart.</i>

241
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:45,641
<i>Walid, Karim, Omar,</i>
<i>as well as my whole family.</i>

242
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:49,705
<i>To all Reggae fans and</i>
<i>to the Tangiers soccer team.</i>

243
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:53,255
<i>To all Reggae fans and</i>
<i>to the Tangiers soccer team.</i>

244
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,472
After listening to this song,

245
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:58,187
we will listen to the news
with Patrice Martin.

246
00:17:58,288 --> 00:18:01,484
After this song,
we'll give you the news.

247
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,317
<i>It's better to think of nothing</i>
<i>Than not to think at all</i>

248
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,325
<i>Nothing is already something</i>

249
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:11,334
<i>It's already a lot</i>

250
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:16,551
<i>We don't remember a thing</i>
<i>And since we forget it all</i>

251
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:19,366
<i>Nothing is better</i>

252
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:22,603
<i>Nothing is better than anything else</i>

253
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:25,736
I say "he," but maybe it's a woman?

254
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,621
I don't know.
Give them to someone, sell them.

255
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:31,851
But, please, dear,
stop talking about it.

256
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:34,340
If I were you,
I would die to know who it is.

257
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,455
Are you sure you don't want me
to ask the flower shop?

258
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,250
Are you crazy?

259
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:41,668
Anonymous gifts are like
anonymous letters. It's blackmail.

260
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,625
Give them to me.

261
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:48,168
It's too bad.

262
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,962
How is Sami?

263
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:51,624
It's hard to know with him.

264
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:55,851
Resolution 1 546 was voted earlier
at the UN headquarters in New York.

265
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:59,748
Iraq is scheduled to recover
its sovereignty on June 30th.

266
00:19:15,472 --> 00:19:16,420
Where are the dogs?

267
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:18,120
It's lunchtime for them.

268
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,460
So you finally made up your mind?

269
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,901
Hi, Bilal.

270
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:25,356
-Don't just stand there. Come in.
-Am I interrupting?

271
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,087
What are you talking about?

272
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:27,020
You woke me up
in the middle of the night.

273
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,251
I was afraid. I didn't know if you
were allowed to have friends over.

274
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:33,003
My bosses don't live here.
I see them once a year in July.

275
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:34,532
I didn't know if you wanted to see me.

276
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,720
I told you to come in. Are you deaf?

277
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,243
The garden looks beautiful.
Can you take me on a tour?

278
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:44,456
Is that why you're here?

279
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,933
No. I came for you.

280
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:54,025
Why aren't you looking at me?

281
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,418
Well, there. I am looking at you.

282
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,468
You want one?

283
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:00,518
No, I quit smoking, drinking,
and going out.

284
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:01,605
I quit everything.

285
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:02,824
Even sex?

286
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:05,736
That's the only thing
you have in mind.

287
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,530
I don't care. I could do without.

288
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:08,460
I don't believe that.

289
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,814
See? I don't need anything.
I live like a king here.

290
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,122
I make 2,000 dinars a month.

291
00:20:14,223 --> 00:20:17,519
A garden, a swimming pool,
a view of the sea.

292
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,754
That's true. I couldn't give you
all that in Paris.

293
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,165
Don't start again with Paris.

294
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:23,914
It's nice to visit,
but I wouldn't stay there.

295
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,219
I've always told you.
I don't want to depend on you.

296
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,043
Sorry for talking about Paris.

297
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,086
Always apologizing.
Like all Europeans.

298
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:32,428
The "love of my life" trick,
is that European, too?

299
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:33,804
I don't know
what you're talking about.

300
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:35,365
You know how it goes.

301
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:37,861
They pick a guy, they take
him home in their luggage,

302
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:39,244
and if there's a problem,
they send him back to his village.

303
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:40,936
I would never do anything
like that to you, Bilal.

304
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,218
You're too suspicious.

305
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,108
You need to learn how to trust people.

306
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,404
Trust? That's right.
You're not honest, Sami.

307
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:48,846
What about that poor Nadia?

308
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,918
I don't understand
what you're doing together.

309
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:52,006
I need her.

310
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:54,445
Of course, you don't know anything
about connections between people.

311
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:55,918
You despise everyone.

312
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:57,390
You're wrong, Sami.

313
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:59,975
I am not looking for love.
I just want respect.

314
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,509
You don't know what you want.

315
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:02,957
You don't make decisions.

316
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,386
It's understandable, though.

317
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:09,481
Half Moroccan, half French.
Half man, half woman.

318
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:11,918
It must be hard for you
to figure it out.

319
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:18,476
Where are you going?

320
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,583
It's time for me to go
take care of the garden.

321
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:30,662
How's everyone?

322
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:55,013
Well, I'll let you work, then.

323
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,541
No, wait.
I want to show you something.

324
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:00,235
Look at this.

325
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,921
40,000 dinars.
I got a two-year financing plan.

326
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:05,551
-Isn't it beautiful?
-Yeah.

327
00:22:14,448 --> 00:22:17,131
What are you waiting for?
That's why you came, isn't it?

328
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:19,817
I thought you didn't want
to have sex anymore.

329
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,044
I don't miss it,
but if I have the opportunity. . . .

330
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:27,374
Come on, take your clothes off.

331
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,326
Is this all you have?

332
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:34,319
Is it for a ring or a necklace?

333
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,845
I don't know yet.

334
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:39,846
I am here to help you. But it is
difficult without knowing the person.

335
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:41,380
Wait. I have a photo.

336
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:47,052
It's an old one,
but she's about my age now.

337
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,546
Too bad it's a black and white photo.

338
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,436
The color of her eyes
is very important.

339
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,608
She has green eyes.

340
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:00,875
I need to think about it
a little bit more.

341
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,502
Thank you very much, sir.

342
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:22,214
Why didn't Said come with us?

343
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,003
He prefers watching television.

344
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:28,807
Watch out with the bottles.
Double the bags.

345
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:30,318
Do you need help?

346
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:34,149
You know children don't like shopping.

347
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,673
Don't move. Don't strain yourself.
I am a doctor. Let me see this.

348
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,155
It doesn't seem broken.
It's only the cartilage.

349
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:35,944
You need to get some X-rays.

350
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:38,951
Breathe slowly. With your mouth.

351
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:40,299
How do you feel?

352
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:41,806
My stomach hurts.

353
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:43,245
Does your head hurt?

354
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,603
I'm telling you, my stomach hurts.
I am. . . .

355
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:48,045
You're what?

356
00:24:49,743 --> 00:24:52,809
I'm emptying my bowels.
I have the runs.

357
00:24:52,912 --> 00:24:54,472
Stay back!

358
00:24:56,943 --> 00:24:59,464
Don't lower your head.
Keep your head back.

359
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,789
Where's my savior?

360
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:41,034
Your savior's name is Nathan.
He's my husband.

361
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:44,070
He had to go.
You're not his only patient.

362
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,412
He really wants you to get an X-ray.

363
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,545
It's nothing. I'll have a bump
on my nose tomorrow.

364
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:50,575
Still pretending to be a brute?

365
00:25:50,672 --> 00:25:54,349
Yes. I am a constant guy.
That's my nature.

366
00:25:58,127 --> 00:25:59,982
What are you doing in Tangiers?

367
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,494
I am overseeing the construction of a
broadcasting center in the Free Zone.

368
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,185
Yes, I've heard of it.
It's an ambitious project.

369
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:07,596
It's very involved, politically.

370
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:10,542
You know, I only handle
the construction part.

371
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,225
I need to give them the building
in six months.

372
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:15,466
I don't care about the rest.

373
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:17,193
It's a TV channel
that will serve all of North Africa,

374
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:18,473
as a rival to Aljazeera.

375
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:21,390
It will promote moderate Islam.

376
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,897
Sir, may I remind you that you have an
appointment at the consulting office?

377
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:28,333
And I'll remind you that
the appointment is in an hour.

378
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:29,358
Yes, but you wanted to talk

379
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,277
about the contractors' estimates
before the meeting.

380
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,710
Very well. I'll be right there.

381
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:36,869
Why are you laughing?

382
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:40,455
When I first met you, you were skinny
and you were always talking

383
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,145
about how you were broke
and proud of it.

384
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:45,157
So?

385
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,603
So, it looks like you've made it,
as they say.

386
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:54,091
Your family didn't come with you?

387
00:26:54,223 --> 00:27:01,098
No, I'm single.
I'm the same as when we met.

388
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:04,940
You never got married?

389
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:06,854
No. Why?

390
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:10,414
Oh, nothing.

391
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:11,820
Well, Antoine, I have to go,

392
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,181
because I do have a family,
and I need to take care of them.

393
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,526
I can give you a ride.

394
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:27,143
That's very sweet, but
I don't need it. I have Nathan's car.

395
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:28,524
But we're going to see each other
again, right?

396
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:30,892
Of course, if you're here for six
months, there will be other occasions.

397
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:32,715
Tell me when. It will be easier.

398
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:34,124
I would love to have you over
for dinner,

399
00:27:34,223 --> 00:27:36,557
but I work every night after 8:00 pm,
so it's not very practical.

400
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,216
I know. I listen to you every night.

401
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,115
I used to be the news host.

402
00:27:39,215 --> 00:27:41,287
That was more appropriate for me,
but I need to make a living, so...

403
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:42,569
So, when do we see each other?

404
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:44,133
Listen, Antoine, I'll let you know.

405
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:47,305
I know which hotel you're staying at.
I promise I'll call you.

406
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,613
What should I plan for Sunday?

407
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:11,751
The company has agreements
with the Yachting club.

408
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:13,033
Would you like to go on a boat ride?

409
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:16,169
No. I'd rather stay in the hotel.

410
00:28:16,271 --> 00:28:18,955
If you refuse all entertainment,
you'll end up being depressed.

411
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:20,102
There are many things to see.

412
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:22,346
The Phoenician tombs,
the Caves of Hercules, Cape Spartel.

413
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:24,586
Don't bother, Nabila.
I am not interested.

414
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:25,635
What are you interested in, then?

415
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:29,671
I am paid to organize your leisure
time. I don't know what to do anymore.

416
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:33,354
You really want
to do something for me?

417
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:35,048
Tell me about witchcraft.

418
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:37,610
Witchcraft?

419
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:40,101
Well, yes. It is still practiced
in your country, isn't it?

420
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:42,793
Parallel activities are not included
in my job description.

421
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:43,975
I would be too scared to get fired.

422
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,535
Nobody will know about it.
It will be our secret.

423
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:49,061
Of course, your price will be mine.

424
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:53,477
It's not only a question of money.
It's a question of belief, knowledge.

425
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:56,517
Well, precisely. Teach me, Nabila.

426
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:58,445
I only know the most common rituals.

427
00:28:58,543 --> 00:29:00,550
Put a spell on someone
or break that spell.

428
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,622
That's exactly what I need.

429
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:06,597
I would like someone
to fall in love with me.

430
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,144
In the name of God. . . .

431
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,138
God is great!

432
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:44,462
God is great!

433
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,000
God is great!

434
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:25,413
What are you doing here, Nabila?

435
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:28,716
This is a documentary
about the Gnawa Brotherhood.

436
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:31,979
There are other brotherhoods.
The Issawa, the Hmadcha.

437
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,901
In this one, you'll see a Lila.

438
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,447
It's a therapy that exorcises
the demons within us.

439
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:40,519
I don't need therapy. I am not sick.

440
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:45,293
It could set you free
from that person.

441
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:49,483
I don't need to be set free.
I want to cast a spell on her.

442
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,649
Most spells are evil acts.

443
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:56,646
Let's be clear. I mean no harm.

444
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:59,785
You can't possess someone
without hurting him or her.

445
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:10,149
Fine. Well, I thank you, then.

446
00:31:22,095 --> 00:31:25,226
Listen, Nathan.
You should really talk to Sami.

447
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:27,182
Did you see that poor Nadia?
She's completely lost.

448
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,287
I don't know how you can be
so unperturbed.

449
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:31,333
You didn't have to invite them.

450
00:31:31,471 --> 00:31:35,116
You're impossible!
What did you want me to do?

451
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:35,978
What would you have done?

452
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,006
I would have welcomed them.

453
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,274
I would have accepted them
the way they are.

454
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:43,301
That's called controlling yourself.

455
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:45,862
Nonsense. I call that cowardice.

456
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:50,408
You're always over-dramatizing.
It's just a matter of behavior.

457
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:54,373
You should reflect on that.
It would give everyone a vacation.

458
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,165
The law of silence. As always.

459
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:05,865
You're not working today?

460
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,138
I am. At 1 1:00 am.

461
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:11,949
You start working later every day.

462
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:14,888
It's not my fault. Clients
don't come rushing at the door.

463
00:32:23,214 --> 00:32:25,189
You have no excuse today.
Did you see the weather?

464
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:28,393
You have to make an effort to go out.
It will do you good.

465
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:30,797
I don't feel like going out.

466
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:37,511
What's wrong, Nadia?
You don't want to tell me?

467
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:39,109
It's nothing, madam.

468
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:42,597
It's just a little down phase,
as Sami would say.

469
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:47,787
He's something else. Never around.
Always out and about.

470
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:50,156
It's only normal.

471
00:32:50,255 --> 00:32:53,516
He hasn't been here for a long time,
so he's enjoying himself.

472
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,323
I hope he takes care of you
a bit more than this in Paris.

473
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,844
I don't need anyone
to take care of me.

474
00:33:02,574 --> 00:33:04,778
Do you like it there?
Do you have friends?

475
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:09,326
Look, don't worry about me.
It's not a problem.

476
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,430
I am used to being alone.

477
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:14,795
Besides, I have Said.
You know how children are.

478
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:18,059
You don't have time
to get bored with them.

479
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,424
Stretch your arms
and push with your legs.

480
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:32,935
There. Push with your legs.
Come on! Come on!

481
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,730
Like that? Is that okay?

482
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:50,985
Are you cold?

483
00:33:51,087 --> 00:33:51,817
No, I'm fine.

484
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,163
So, how was it?

485
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:53,928
It was awesome.

486
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:55,754
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Can I watch television?

487
00:33:55,855 --> 00:33:58,244
Yes, but take a shower first.

488
00:34:31,854 --> 00:34:33,643
Quiet!

489
00:34:58,126 --> 00:35:01,028
<i>Sam has agreed to do something</i>
<i>for Norreddine,</i>

490
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:05,096
<i>in order to help him with the issues</i>
<i>tearing his soul apart.</i>

491
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,955
<i>Everything is blessed with incense.</i>

492
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:08,713
<i>Norreddine is wrapped</i>
<i>in various cloths</i>

493
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,789
<i>bearing the colors of the Gnawa.</i>

494
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:15,205
<i>Each color stands for one</i>
<i>of the spirits living in our world.</i>

495
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,987
<i>Sam tries every color, because</i>
<i>he doesn't know yet which spirit</i>

496
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:23,081
<i>has entered Norreddine's soul,</i>
<i>disrupting his existence.</i>

497
00:35:24,143 --> 00:35:28,137
<i>He has also chosen a multicolored</i>
<i>rooster for the same reason.</i>

498
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,894
<i>Sam calls the various spirits,</i>

499
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:44,846
<i>inviting them to move away</i>
<i>from Norreddine.</i>

500
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,180
<i>At one point, he threatens them</i>
<i>with his knife.</i>

501
00:36:21,423 --> 00:36:25,416
<i>Two terrorist attacks and four</i>
<i>hostages were liberated in Iraq today.</i>

502
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,617
<i>We'll start with information</i>
<i>given by a Polish general</i>

503
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,174
<i>to the judicial authorities</i>
<i>in his country.</i>

504
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:35,076
<i>Four hostages were liberated by</i>

505
00:36:35,183 --> 00:36:37,256
<i>Soldiers were buried last Saturday</i>

506
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,847
<i>with one of their compatriots,</i>
<i>Pietro Petrucci.</i>

507
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,909
I don't mean to be a party pooper,
but we do need to work.

508
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:05,350
Jerk!

509
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:19,306
"To people who listen to Baid escata."

510
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:23,203
"To students at the National
Business School in Agadir."

511
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:25,416
"To Rose, my dear wife,
mother of the beautiful Ines."

512
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:28,039
Hey, you're lucky to have
your little tribe around.

513
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:29,320
That's true. I'm lucky.

514
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:52,299
I didn't hear from you,
and it's Sunday, so I thought. . . .

515
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:54,471
I'm sorry, Antoine.
I completely forgot about you.

516
00:37:54,574 --> 00:37:56,843
I'm sort of busy these days.

517
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,535
How is your nose?

518
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,006
Look, it changes colors.

519
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:03,786
You're exaggerating. It's almost gone.

520
00:38:03,887 --> 00:38:06,058
Would you have a glass of water?
It's so hot. I'm really thirsty.

521
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,973
Sure, come in.

522
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:12,745
I'm warning you, the house is really
messy. We sort of live like nomads.

523
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:15,814
This is Rachel Meyer,
my work partner.

524
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,024
Antoine Lavau, an old friend.

525
00:38:18,126 --> 00:38:20,396
An old friend?
I don't really like that.

526
00:38:20,494 --> 00:38:23,691
Antoine was my first love.
Is that better?

527
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:27,402
It seems more accurate.
It's nice to meet you.

528
00:38:27,503 --> 00:38:29,510
You said you wanted a glass of water?

529
00:38:29,615 --> 00:38:33,160
Yes, a glass of water with
a little scotch, if you have some.

530
00:38:36,495 --> 00:38:39,877
I told Cecile how much
I liked your show.

531
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:42,405
All those people sending signals
to each other in the night.

532
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:44,300
It makes my imagination wander.

533
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,461
It's always the same messages.
It's a little monotonous.

534
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:52,268
Not for me. People's love life
is the only thing I am interested in.

535
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:55,268
It's so refreshing to meet a man
who isn't afraid of feelings.

536
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,480
Right, Cecile?

537
00:38:57,582 --> 00:39:01,892
Tell me, do you think the first love
can become the last love?

538
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:06,246
Don't pay attention to him.
He's crazy.

539
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:09,766
Here, take this. You need it.

540
00:39:10,606 --> 00:39:13,126
So, how's the cripple doing?

541
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:16,231
I apologize for showing up at your
house like this, unannounced.

542
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:18,636
You're welcome here.
My wife's friends are friends of mine.

543
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:21,320
-Thank you.
-Don't stand like this. Come here.

544
00:39:23,054 --> 00:39:24,429
Can you serve me a drink, too?

545
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:27,658
Do it yourself, honey. I need
to work on the show with Rachel.

546
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:32,811
I married a feminist.
She doesn't let anything slide.

547
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,852
So how is my head?

548
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,657
Everything's normal.

549
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,482
Let me see.

550
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,614
Tell me, Nathan, do you receive
patients in your bathing suit, now?

551
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:51,784
Please go ahead, doctor.
It doesn't bother me.

552
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:55,017
I have to say, I like to spend
my Sundays naked.

553
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,574
Your friend is less of a conformist
than you are.

554
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,369
What kind of lotion are you using?

555
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,977
"Morning Care" by Clarins.
The pharmacist recommended it.

556
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:07,112
That's just cosmetics.
It doesn't heal the bruise.

557
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,105
So? Not too disoriented in Tangiers?

558
00:40:12,206 --> 00:40:13,897
Oh, you know, I travel a lot.

559
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:16,998
I've worked on construction sites
in Mali, Turkey, in the Philippines.

560
00:40:17,102 --> 00:40:20,418
I even lived in Chile for two years.

561
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,847
Well, if you're staying for a while,
it's silly to stay in a hotel.

562
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:25,773
There are plenty of houses
to rent around here.

563
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:27,300
Cecile didn't tell you about it?

564
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:29,926
It would be nice, but I don't
want to abuse your generosity.

565
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:32,780
I'm sure she could help you.
Right, Cecile?

566
00:40:32,878 --> 00:40:35,464
Thank you. You're embarrassing me.

567
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:39,911
What do you do in the evening?

568
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:43,402
Absolutely nothing.

569
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:46,989
May I use the restroom?

570
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,176
They're at the end of the hall.

571
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:55,112
Pardon me.

572
00:40:57,103 --> 00:40:58,990
Your friend looks a little lost.

573
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,961
Should we have him stay for dinner?

574
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:04,484
Don't you think
there are enough of us already?

575
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,669
Listen, Cecile.
Is he your friend or not?

576
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:07,497
Of course he is.

577
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,421
But we don't have that much food,
and we're not done yet.

578
00:41:09,518 --> 00:41:10,860
We have to be
at the station in an hour.

579
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,071
As you wish.

580
00:41:12,174 --> 00:41:14,116
Would you mind
putting some clothes on, Nathan?

581
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,717
I'll jump in one last time.

582
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:19,467
"To students at the National
Business School in Agadir."

583
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:20,679
I like the one from Montreal.

584
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:24,874
I want to dedicate this song
to Moroccans living in Montreal.

585
00:41:24,974 --> 00:41:27,341
"My brother, my sister. . . ."

586
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:29,478
I don't understand this one,
but if you do. . .

587
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:31,655
"I miss the family a whole lot."

588
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:35,501
"To my neighbors and friends
in the community."

589
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,817
Come swim with me, Said.

590
00:41:47,918 --> 00:41:48,998
No, I don't want to go.

591
00:41:49,103 --> 00:41:53,358
You're scared! I know it.
You're scared!

592
00:41:53,487 --> 00:41:54,599
Come on.

593
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,503
That's it. Let go.

594
00:41:59,855 --> 00:42:02,026
There you go.

595
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,772
You like it?

596
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:27,277
How far are we?

597
00:42:27,374 --> 00:42:29,447
Two or three miles.

598
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,584
It's beautiful. You'll see.
It's worth the effort.

599
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,286
If you like it so much,
why don't you rent it yourself?

600
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,041
I can't afford it.

601
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:41,636
The windshield is filthy.

602
00:42:41,743 --> 00:42:43,531
It really doesn't matter.

603
00:42:44,558 --> 00:42:46,730
By the way, how old is your husband?

604
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:48,587
He's younger than me.

605
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:51,141
-Why are you asking?
-No particular reason.

606
00:42:53,998 --> 00:42:56,387
How is the retirement situation here?

607
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,241
What kind of question is that?

608
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:02,604
You want to know if we make
a good living? Not really, Antoine.

609
00:43:03,918 --> 00:43:06,307
Well, with your job at the radio...

610
00:43:06,414 --> 00:43:08,072
You know, my job at the radio. . . .

611
00:43:08,174 --> 00:43:10,378
They give priority to Moroccans,
which is understandable.

612
00:43:10,478 --> 00:43:12,518
Besides, I don't speak Arabic.

613
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:15,207
Well, what. . .?

614
00:43:19,246 --> 00:43:20,424
That's all we needed.

615
00:43:20,526 --> 00:43:23,308
Are you trying that old trick on me?

616
00:43:23,406 --> 00:43:25,511
Please, Antoine. It's not funny.

617
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,421
Doesn't look like
there's much traffic on this road.

618
00:43:45,134 --> 00:43:47,687
Nathan probably
tried to work on the car again.

619
00:43:48,398 --> 00:43:50,765
Look at this. He replaced the fuse
with a piece of wire.

620
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,750
-Is it serious?
-What an idiot.

621
00:43:52,846 --> 00:43:54,122
I shouldn't have washed
the windshield.

622
00:43:54,222 --> 00:43:57,484
The water created a short circuit.

623
00:43:57,582 --> 00:43:59,622
I could have ruined
the wiring harness.

624
00:43:59,726 --> 00:44:02,409
Well, I didn't know you
were such an expert mechanic!

625
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:06,122
I had to learn, Antoine.
I don't have a driver.

626
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,147
I feel like you're giving me grief
for having money. It's tiresome.

627
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,022
Are you going to be able to fix it?

628
00:44:14,126 --> 00:44:17,093
No. We need a mechanic.

629
00:44:18,702 --> 00:44:19,564
Can I use your cell phone?

630
00:44:19,662 --> 00:44:23,405
For once that we were alone,
I didn't want to be interrupted.

631
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:26,088
I don't have my phone, either.
I always forget it.

632
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:33,092
So what do we do?

633
00:44:34,094 --> 00:44:35,949
Well. . . .

634
00:44:39,822 --> 00:44:42,605
I'll show you the house, anyway.
Come with me.

635
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:45,195
We'll take the shortcut.

636
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:52,776
What are you thinking of?

637
00:44:52,878 --> 00:44:54,765
Nothing in particular.

638
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:58,955
I'm thinking I would like us to get
lost, where nobody could find us.

639
00:44:59,054 --> 00:45:00,581
No risk of that over here.

640
00:45:00,686 --> 00:45:02,596
You can always find your way
by looking at the sea.

641
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:04,328
Look, right over there.

642
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:07,018
It's strange, but I have the feeling

643
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:10,598
you completely forgot about me
all these years.

644
00:45:10,702 --> 00:45:12,741
It's only normal.
I don't live in the past.

645
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:14,733
I have a life, Antoine. You saw that.

646
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,685
Alas, I did.

647
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,841
For me, it's the opposite.

648
00:45:20,942 --> 00:45:23,724
Absence brought me closer to you.

649
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:26,440
As time passed,
I missed you even more.

650
00:45:28,654 --> 00:45:31,207
You want me to believe that you
have missed me for 30 years?

651
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:35,020
3 1 years, eight months, and 20 days,
to be precise.

652
00:45:35,118 --> 00:45:38,282
But I always knew
I would see you again.

653
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:40,554
It's a coincidence, Antoine.

654
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,883
Oh, no, it is not. I looked for you.
What do you think?

655
00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:49,451
One day I found out
that you lived here.

656
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,846
The hardest part
was to be sent to Tangiers.

657
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:56,456
It took some time.
I did everything I could.

658
00:45:56,558 --> 00:45:59,973
Anyway, I couldn't come any sooner.

659
00:46:00,078 --> 00:46:01,900
I don't really understand
what you're getting at.

660
00:46:01,998 --> 00:46:06,471
We said we would love each other
all our lives.

661
00:46:06,574 --> 00:46:07,436
You don't remember?

662
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:09,738
What are you talking about?
I am sure you loved other women.

663
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,482
I am not talking about sex.
It has nothing to do with it.

664
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:16,070
Love doesn't change
like one changes partners.

665
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,214
What do you want from me, exactly?

666
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:21,285
I want to grow old with you.

667
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,456
You're completely nuts,
my poor Antoine!

668
00:46:24,558 --> 00:46:30,025
I knew you would say that.
It doesn't matter.

669
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:31,980
I don't want to force it on you.

670
00:46:32,974 --> 00:46:34,468
I will wait.

671
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:43,396
Did you send those flowers?

672
00:46:43,502 --> 00:46:49,863
Yes, I knew you liked roses.
I am happy you understood.

673
00:46:49,966 --> 00:46:52,333
Listen, Antoine. If you want to see me
again, don't talk about any of this.

674
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,510
We're not 20 anymore.

675
00:46:53,614 --> 00:46:56,614
Passion is behind us.
All right?

676
00:46:56,718 --> 00:46:58,245
Fine, as you wish.

677
00:47:00,974 --> 00:47:02,534
What's ahead of us, then?

678
00:47:02,638 --> 00:47:04,525
Nothing.

679
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:07,306
It's like this forest. It stops here.
Beyond, there's a cliff.

680
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:09,675
There's nothingness.

681
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:13,929
That's not true. It isn't nothingness.

682
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:18,154
There's the sea.
And look, there's a ferry crossing.

683
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:19,563
Over there, there's some fog.

684
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:22,826
Behind the fog is Spain,
and Spain is the beginning of Europe.

685
00:47:22,925 --> 00:47:27,628
Stop it, Antoine. You're tiring me.
I even forgot why we came here.

686
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:30,311
You wanted to show me the house.

687
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,803
That's right. The house.
It's that one.

688
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:45,731
Don't look at them like that.
They'll feel obliged to do something.

689
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:46,820
You knew they were there?

690
00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:47,853
Of course. I saw them.

691
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,659
They know they have nothing to fear
from us. We're just two lovers.

692
00:47:53,901 --> 00:47:58,473
Between police raids and robbers,
I don't know how they survive.

693
00:47:58,574 --> 00:48:02,600
Maybe they survive because
they have a goal. To reach Europe.

694
00:48:02,702 --> 00:48:05,123
This is the last stop before paradise.

695
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:32,262
Is Cecile home?

696
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:35,909
She went shopping with Said.

697
00:48:37,134 --> 00:48:38,312
Is Sami still asleep?

698
00:48:38,446 --> 00:48:39,591
You want me to wake him up?

699
00:48:39,694 --> 00:48:41,516
No, I came to see you.

700
00:48:46,254 --> 00:48:47,912
Did you write this?

701
00:48:50,062 --> 00:48:51,240
Are you out of your mind?

702
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:53,230
The pharmacist knows my handwriting.
There aren't that many doctors here.

703
00:48:53,325 --> 00:48:57,930
She refused to serve me.
I'm not surprised she called you.

704
00:48:59,662 --> 00:49:02,978
Do you often take that kind of crap?

705
00:49:03,086 --> 00:49:06,948
I am an adult.
I can do whatever I want.

706
00:49:09,198 --> 00:49:10,146
Let's talk about this with Sami.

707
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,654
Let me go! You're hurting me!

708
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,772
Listen, Sami. Either you keep an eye
on your friend or you leave.

709
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,812
What the hell is going on?

710
00:49:27,918 --> 00:49:29,544
Don't yell at me. I don't know
what you're talking about.

711
00:49:29,645 --> 00:49:31,784
Come with me. Go ahead.

712
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:38,244
That girl is a wreck.
And she has a kid, on top of it.

713
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,204
You're completely irresponsible.

714
00:49:40,302 --> 00:49:41,676
Calm down. Tell me what's going on.

715
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:43,562
What's going on
is that she's loaded on pills.

716
00:49:43,662 --> 00:49:47,786
It's dangerous.
She steals my prescriptions, too.

717
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:50,220
I'm tolerant, but this goes
beyond the acceptable.

718
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:09,031
Are you all right?

719
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:12,909
Don't ask me if I'm all right every
five minutes. Yes, I am all right.

720
00:50:20,462 --> 00:50:23,080
Mommy's hands are cold.

721
00:50:23,182 --> 00:50:24,807
Then let me carry you.

722
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,248
So how does it feel to be tall?

723
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:35,500
The lady read me a story about giants
last night. I'd like to meet one.

724
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:38,664
Giants don't exist anymore.
Only midgets still exist.

725
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:41,671
Otherwise,
humans are the same height.

726
00:50:42,317 --> 00:50:45,252
How tall do you think I will be?
As tall as you?

727
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,514
I don't know. It's too soon to know.

728
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:55,660
When can you know?

729
00:50:55,757 --> 00:50:58,757
You know it when it happens.
Come on. Let's fly!

730
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:21,542
You don't want to play soccer?

731
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,020
No, I don't know these guys.

732
00:51:23,118 --> 00:51:25,387
That way, you'll get to know them.

733
00:51:25,486 --> 00:51:26,631
You want to play on the slide?

734
00:51:26,734 --> 00:51:28,457
No, that's for little kids.

735
00:51:28,558 --> 00:51:30,216
Why don't we go to the beach?

736
00:51:30,317 --> 00:51:32,456
Your mommy can't handle the sun.

737
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,676
Why did we come here?

738
00:51:37,774 --> 00:51:39,050
So you could have fun.

739
00:51:39,149 --> 00:51:40,775
I prefer watching television.

740
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:44,844
Vacation is not
for watching television.

741
00:51:44,942 --> 00:51:46,764
I can't believe you still
haven't been to the sea.

742
00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:50,756
I don't want to go with the lady.
Why don't we go? Just you and me?

743
00:51:50,862 --> 00:51:53,350
Don't bother him with that. He doesn't
have time. He has things to do.

744
00:51:53,453 --> 00:51:56,552
It's the same in Paris.
You never do anything with me.

745
00:51:56,654 --> 00:51:58,541
Can I go over there?

746
00:51:58,638 --> 00:52:01,671
Yes. Be careful not to fall.

747
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:10,338
Do you want to go back to Paris?

748
00:52:10,446 --> 00:52:13,445
I don't want to stop you
from seeing Bilal.

749
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,437
Bilal is just a fling, you know.

750
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:19,559
He's not essential. You're
the most important thing. Seriously.

751
00:52:21,197 --> 00:52:23,434
Would you rather stay
or go back to Paris?

752
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:29,738
I am unable to make any decisions.

753
00:52:29,837 --> 00:52:31,976
Okay, let's go back.
I'm making the decision.

754
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:37,099
Sometimes,
I feel like I'm ruining your life.

755
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:39,620
Are you kidding? If I didn't have you,
I don't know what I would do.

756
00:52:39,725 --> 00:52:42,059
You would live with a boy.

757
00:52:42,157 --> 00:52:45,386
Don't say that. I'm happy with you.
Seriously.

758
00:52:56,461 --> 00:52:58,217
Why are you wearing
this much makeup?

759
00:53:00,205 --> 00:53:03,402
I looked dead this morning,
so I added a little color.

760
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,885
What are you doing?

761
00:53:15,982 --> 00:53:18,021
Cleaning the swimming pool,
as I do each year.

762
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:20,362
So you'll put a tarp on it, and we
won't be able to swim anymore?

763
00:53:20,461 --> 00:53:22,730
There are still some nice days
in September.

764
00:53:27,021 --> 00:53:29,891
Once again, I do something,
and it's wrong.

765
00:53:31,502 --> 00:53:35,179
I was surprised, that's all.
I'm sorry.

766
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:52,940
I need to give an answer
about Casablanca.

767
00:53:53,038 --> 00:53:57,194
Go ahead, if you want. I've already
told you I didn't want to live there.

768
00:53:57,293 --> 00:53:59,911
It could be a good thing, you working
in Casablanca and me working here.

769
00:54:00,013 --> 00:54:03,210
At least, we would see each other
only when we wanted to.

770
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:07,684
Routine destroys relationships.
Don't use that old tired argument.

771
00:54:09,005 --> 00:54:10,892
All I see is a better
financial situation.

772
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:12,298
This month, I am completely broke.

773
00:54:12,397 --> 00:54:14,634
What do you mean?

774
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:16,806
I gave Sami some money for Nadia.

775
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:19,081
She needs to go to rehab
in a proper institute,

776
00:54:19,181 --> 00:54:20,742
where they can do a good follow up.

777
00:54:20,845 --> 00:54:23,595
What about the kid?
Will Sami take care of him?

778
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,734
Yes, the time for her to recover.

779
00:54:25,837 --> 00:54:27,659
Do you see Sami raising a child?

780
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:31,436
He will learn. He'll figure it out,
like everybody else.

781
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:33,901
Sure, let him deal with it.
I think you don't really care.

782
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:34,891
I do care.

783
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:36,964
I talked about it with him.
We get along well.

784
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:38,247
I noticed.

785
00:54:39,725 --> 00:54:41,765
You keep smiling at each other.

786
00:54:42,669 --> 00:54:45,451
We understand each other.
It looks like it bothers you.

787
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:48,866
It bothers me because it's fake.
You don't know anything about Sami.

788
00:54:48,973 --> 00:54:52,683
You don't even know he likes boys and
you're talking about understanding.

789
00:54:52,781 --> 00:54:57,702
What? He likes boys?
Did he tell you that?

790
00:54:57,806 --> 00:54:59,748
No, but I've known for a long time.

791
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,139
And how do you know that?
You've seen him have sex with a man?

792
00:55:03,245 --> 00:55:04,260
Don't over-dramatize.

793
00:55:04,366 --> 00:55:06,755
I know because I watch him.
I pay attention to him.

794
00:55:06,861 --> 00:55:09,130
It's important to know these things.

795
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:12,551
Maybe we should talk
about it with him.

796
00:55:12,654 --> 00:55:15,556
I don't want to talk about that crap.
It's pointless.

797
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:18,825
You're not going to cop out?
It's your son, after all!

798
00:55:18,926 --> 00:55:21,577
My son, my son. What does it mean?
Don't get on my nerves with this!

799
00:55:21,677 --> 00:55:23,084
Stop yelling!

800
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:25,963
We can't even have a simple and
direct conversation in this house.

801
00:55:26,061 --> 00:55:28,679
Listen, Cecile.
This is simple and direct.

802
00:55:28,782 --> 00:55:30,854
If you want to get involved in your
son's sex life, it's your problem.

803
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:33,227
I consider that it's
none of my business.

804
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:36,643
I'm going out. I am not sleepy.

805
00:55:41,325 --> 00:55:43,845
<i>I am dedicating this song to all</i>
<i>my friends in the neighborhood.</i>

806
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:48,040
<i>Youssef Borki, Issam,</i>
<i>Adissad Gaza, Younes, Aissa,</i>

807
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:50,923
<i>all my family, and my friend Salma.</i>

808
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:53,836
<i>To my love, Ghizlane,</i>
<i>I love her very much.</i>

809
00:56:07,983 --> 00:56:10,535
-Absolutely.
-It's not the first time.

810
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:12,264
Hello. I hope I'm not bothering you.

811
00:56:12,366 --> 00:56:13,064
Not at all.

812
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:14,857
I just wanted to see how it's done.

813
00:56:14,959 --> 00:56:16,715
-You want some coffee?
-No, thank you.

814
00:56:16,814 --> 00:56:17,862
Come here.

815
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,366
<i>I dedicate this beautiful song</i>
<i>to my mother, my father,</i>

816
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:22,535
<i>my sister, Anna,</i>
<i>and my little brother, Zacariah.</i>

817
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:24,329
You're lucky.
We have great songs tonight.

818
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:25,608
. . .if you don't know my name.

819
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,329
Thank you.

820
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:32,140
And here is a song
requested from Germany.

821
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:34,027
-Get out of here, Antoine. Out!
-But...

822
00:56:34,126 --> 00:56:34,792
There are no "buts."

823
00:56:34,894 --> 00:56:35,843
I am tired of you imposing yourself.

824
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,292
You come to my house
without warning!

825
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:40,260
Now you show up when I'm at work!
That's harassment!

826
00:56:40,879 --> 00:56:41,707
You seem on edge.

827
00:56:41,806 --> 00:56:42,788
Shut up, Antoine. Leave!

828
00:56:42,894 --> 00:56:44,967
I don't want to see you anymore!
Never!

829
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:51,370
This song was requested by Aydan,
to all her family and friends.

830
00:56:52,526 --> 00:56:55,276
Now we're going to listen to
"Okam Bale" by Angelique Kidjo.

831
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:57,447
And here is the song
by Angelique Kidjo.

832
00:57:23,438 --> 00:57:25,926
It's the fourth version of
the British-American resolution

833
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:26,826
presented to the UN.

834
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:30,188
The Americans hope for a vote.

835
00:57:30,286 --> 00:57:32,196
They're hoping, but nothing is done.
It's the fourth reunion...

836
00:57:32,302 --> 00:57:36,710
On site, two individuals
were found dead.

837
00:57:37,646 --> 00:57:41,705
Cecile! You see, he's not here.

838
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:44,141
Look, Rachel. I know him by heart.
He won't give up so easily.

839
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:46,475
The only thing he's interested in
is making a mess of my life.

840
00:57:48,494 --> 00:57:49,988
I'm sure he's hiding somewhere.

841
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:51,501
As you can see, there is nobody out.

842
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:53,005
Where's your car?

843
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,509
I took it to the mechanic.
It broke down.

844
00:57:54,606 --> 00:57:55,500
Can you give me a ride?

845
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:58,730
No problem.
I can't believe you're so nervous.

846
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:00,107
All this for a ghost.

847
00:58:00,207 --> 00:58:01,286
A ghost.

848
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,659
Do you think you can safely see
a ghost you were madly in love with?

849
00:58:03,758 --> 00:58:05,100
I don't know what happened
between you two.

850
00:58:05,198 --> 00:58:08,973
You never wanted to talk about it.
So you were madly in love with him?

851
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:13,576
Yes. It was both lust and love.
I never found that with any other man.

852
00:58:13,678 --> 00:58:14,758
I have desired Nathan.

853
00:58:14,863 --> 00:58:17,862
He gave me a lot of pleasure,
but I could never really love him.

854
00:58:17,966 --> 00:58:19,624
I see him as an enemy.

855
00:58:22,286 --> 00:58:24,872
-Let's close it. It's cold.
-Thanks.

856
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:29,699
One, two, three. Come on.

857
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:48,553
You should sleep with Antoine.
That's the only way to end it.

858
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:51,622
It happened to me in New York.
Some guy I hadn't seen for 1 0 years.

859
00:58:51,726 --> 00:58:55,239
We met randomly, we spent a night
together and after that,

860
00:58:55,342 --> 00:58:56,487
we realized that it was over.

861
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,085
There was nothing left between us.

862
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:02,020
We said goodbye without pain,
feeling a great relief.

863
00:59:02,126 --> 00:59:04,646
It has nothing to do with Antoine.
It's not about sleeping with him.

864
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,124
It's something else.

865
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,499
I have the feeling
that after all these years,

866
00:59:10,606 --> 00:59:13,988
he came to find me in Tangiers
to claim what he is owed.

867
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:53,478
Place your bets, please.

868
00:59:53,582 --> 00:59:54,760
Four. Six.

869
00:59:56,686 --> 00:59:59,752
The bets are placed. Thank you.

870
01:00:02,702 --> 01:00:04,295
2 1, red.

871
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:08,451
I'd like to cash out, please.

872
01:00:15,374 --> 01:00:16,999
Thank you.

873
01:00:24,206 --> 01:00:25,930
Good evening, sir.

874
01:00:27,918 --> 01:00:28,485
20,000.

875
01:00:42,574 --> 01:00:44,963
Here you go. 20,000 dinars.
Thank you.

876
01:01:02,222 --> 01:01:04,491
Good evening, doctor.
I didn't know you were a gambler.

877
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:06,728
I never gamble.
I am absolutely not suicidal.

878
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,586
Then what are you doing here?

879
01:01:08,686 --> 01:01:10,791
As you can see, nothing special.
I am drinking.

880
01:01:10,894 --> 01:01:12,782
It's the only place
open day and night.

881
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,358
It's strange how things
close early in this city.

882
01:01:16,462 --> 01:01:17,923
It's the same everywhere
when it's off-season, isn't it?

883
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,037
September is still summer.

884
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:22,052
That's what my wife says.

885
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:23,467
May I?

886
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:26,954
Did she tell you how we met?

887
01:01:27,054 --> 01:01:29,738
No, she just said you were in love
with her when you were kids.

888
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:31,660
Kids? Really?

889
01:01:31,758 --> 01:01:33,514
She also said you were
possessive and jealous.

890
01:01:33,614 --> 01:01:34,956
It's only normal.
She was important to me.

891
01:01:35,054 --> 01:01:38,698
She left me to marry a psychiatrist.
That guy was definitely not a kid.

892
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:40,227
He was 1 0 years older than her.

893
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:44,327
Dr. Bertrand Ferry. Do you know him?

894
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,088
Yes, she lived with him
when I met her.

895
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,329
She followed you to Tangiers.
That's not surprising.

896
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:51,627
No, first we lived in Casablanca.
That's where I am from.

897
01:01:51,725 --> 01:01:53,187
I have a lot of admiration
for you, doctor.

898
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:56,709
You managed to settle with her.
That was my dream. It still is.

899
01:01:56,814 --> 01:02:02,248
If I may be frank, I came to Tangiers
hoping to take her from you.

900
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,759
I am not sure she agrees.
Did you talk to her about it?

901
01:02:06,862 --> 01:02:08,585
Of course. That's why I came.

902
01:02:08,686 --> 01:02:09,733
And?

903
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:12,390
She said no.

904
01:02:12,493 --> 01:02:13,922
At least for now.

905
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:17,292
She even told me
I wasn't allowed to see her.

906
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:18,951
I don't know what to do.

907
01:02:19,854 --> 01:02:21,578
I am not sure I can help you.

908
01:02:21,678 --> 01:02:22,889
In fact, I think
I'm the wrong person for that.

909
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,452
Obviously.

910
01:02:27,438 --> 01:02:29,577
Do you love her?

911
01:02:29,678 --> 01:02:31,914
After 20 years, couples are not
madly in love anymore.

912
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,508
It's something else.

913
01:02:34,094 --> 01:02:35,556
Do you ever cheat on her?

914
01:02:35,662 --> 01:02:38,084
Of course. She knows,
and she has no problem with it.

915
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,907
That's right.
Polygamy is part of the culture.

916
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:43,177
That's not it at all.

917
01:02:43,278 --> 01:02:45,547
I have one wife
and several mistresses.

918
01:02:45,646 --> 01:02:47,206
I also have more than one culture.

919
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,914
She was always in my mind,
even when I was with other women.

920
01:02:52,014 --> 01:02:53,901
For me, it's the opposite.

921
01:02:53,998 --> 01:02:57,162
Since I live with her,
I sometimes need novelty.

922
01:02:58,606 --> 01:03:02,468
I don't understand why you've waited
so long without writing or calling,

923
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:03,948
without contacting her.

924
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:08,388
I was afraid. You can't imagine
how much I was afraid.

925
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:10,152
-Afraid of what?
-Afraid she would reject me.

926
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:12,971
Then I tried very hard to forget her,
but it didn't work.

927
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:16,234
I did a lot of thinking and I thought:

928
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,854
"When I see her again, she'll be
older, her children will be married.

929
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:21,609
My coming back may be good news,

930
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,361
you know what I mean,
some kind of resurrection."

931
01:03:24,462 --> 01:03:25,771
I was wrong.

932
01:03:27,214 --> 01:03:28,392
She prefers staying with you.

933
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:35,851
No.

934
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:36,714
Here you go, sir.

935
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:38,123
Let me pay for it.

936
01:03:50,669 --> 01:03:52,295
I'm sorry.

937
01:03:54,894 --> 01:03:58,210
<i>Cecile, what I feared has happened.</i>

938
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:00,423
<i>I didn't find the words</i>
<i>to convince you.</i>

939
01:04:00,526 --> 01:04:03,624
<i>I thought a miracle was possible,</i>
<i>but the miracle didn't happen.</i>

940
01:04:10,925 --> 01:04:14,122
<i>I don't have a reason</i>
<i>to stay in this country anymore.</i>

941
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:17,671
<i>I will ask to be replaced</i>
<i>on the construction site.</i>

942
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:19,018
<i>I'll never be able to replace you,</i>

943
01:04:19,117 --> 01:04:21,092
<i>because the more I tried,</i>
<i>the less I succeeded.</i>

944
01:04:21,198 --> 01:04:22,692
<i>Today, I feel happy</i>
<i>after seeing you again.</i>

945
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:25,733
<i>I managed to steal a few moments.</i>

946
01:04:25,837 --> 01:04:29,961
<i>The time marked by the clock doesn't</i>
<i>count, because in one look from you,</i>

947
01:04:30,062 --> 01:04:36,805
<i>one move, in the timber of your voice,</i>
<i>I found eternity once again.</i>

948
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:37,673
<i>...recognize me.</i>

949
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:38,886
<i>It would be nice</i>
<i>if you closed your eyes.</i>

950
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:40,037
<i>That way you would</i>
<i>only hear my voice.</i>

951
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:41,385
<i>Every night, I hear yours</i>
<i>on the radio, I look at the city,</i>

952
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:43,461
<i>and to me, you and the city become</i>
<i>one. Now, the moment has come</i>...

953
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:56,423
Let's not stay here. I don't want
people to see me with a stranger.

954
01:06:56,526 --> 01:06:58,216
Especially not a man.

955
01:06:58,702 --> 01:07:01,419
Nadia told me to give you this.
They're CDs.

956
01:07:04,174 --> 01:07:06,476
Why do you refuse to see her?

957
01:07:06,574 --> 01:07:08,995
Because it's not good for me, Sami.

958
01:07:09,102 --> 01:07:11,819
You know, I saw the Taleb last year,
when I was sick.

959
01:07:11,917 --> 01:07:14,634
He told me that twin sisters
have to separate once and for all,

960
01:07:14,734 --> 01:07:16,457
if they want to have a life.

961
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:21,318
Said and I could come eat
at McDonald's. Children love that.

962
01:07:21,421 --> 01:07:22,796
That way, you'll meet him.

963
01:07:22,894 --> 01:07:24,748
I am not allowed to talk to clients
when I work.

964
01:07:24,845 --> 01:07:26,984
You won't talk to him,
but you'll see him.

965
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:29,356
Does he speak Arabic?

966
01:07:29,453 --> 01:07:32,006
No, Nadia, and I speak French.
We live in Paris. It's expected.

967
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:34,342
Is he circumcised?

968
01:07:34,445 --> 01:07:37,129
You know, Nadia.
She doesn't care about religion.

969
01:07:37,229 --> 01:07:39,596
What does that mean?
He's not Muslim?

970
01:07:39,694 --> 01:07:41,516
He has a Moroccan passport.

971
01:07:41,614 --> 01:07:43,370
I handled it myself.
Everything's fine.

972
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:44,746
Does he have your name?

973
01:07:44,846 --> 01:07:47,115
No, his mother's name.

974
01:07:48,045 --> 01:07:51,177
Why don't you get married?
Wouldn't it make things easier?

975
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:54,594
I don't know.
We never talked about it.

976
01:07:54,702 --> 01:07:56,524
Nadia needs a real husband.

977
01:07:56,622 --> 01:07:58,989
She waited too long,
and she was very unlucky with men.

978
01:07:59,086 --> 01:08:01,475
I disagree. She just experienced life.

979
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:03,337
Besides, it gave her Said.
That's good, right?

980
01:08:03,438 --> 01:08:06,787
I know that she's unhappy.
I know her better than you do.

981
01:08:07,438 --> 01:08:08,780
I have my mother's car.
Do you need a ride?

982
01:08:10,158 --> 01:08:14,413
No, I'm fine. I am used to
walking home. It's healthy.

983
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:20,609
It was good to see you.
Take good care of her.

984
01:08:20,718 --> 01:08:24,613
Now that she doesn't have a sister,
I'm glad she still has a brother.

985
01:08:27,342 --> 01:08:30,888
Aicha! Nadia wanted to know
how your parents were doing.

986
01:08:30,989 --> 01:08:33,804
Tell her that our father went to
Agadir to work during the season,

987
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:37,993
and our mother stayed in the village
to rest after her operation.

988
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:40,973
Here. It's not much, but it would
make me happy if you took this.

989
01:08:42,157 --> 01:08:43,466
It was her idea or your idea?

990
01:08:43,565 --> 01:08:45,223
Both of us.

991
01:08:45,326 --> 01:08:47,017
You know what the Taleb says?

992
01:08:47,117 --> 01:08:48,841
A piece of meat earned by working

993
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:51,429
is worth more than a lamb
offered out of sympathy.

994
01:08:52,013 --> 01:08:53,901
Does that mean you don't want it?

995
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:59,783
Yes, I'll take the money. I need it.

996
01:09:00,653 --> 01:09:01,897
Thank you.

997
01:09:57,005 --> 01:09:58,664
1 2 dinars, please.

998
01:10:11,662 --> 01:10:15,077
One Coke, small fries. Okay.
And a cheeseburger.

999
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:31,622
For here or to go?

1000
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:17,707
Bilal!

1001
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:22,434
Bilal!

1002
01:12:23,821 --> 01:12:24,934
Go away!

1003
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:26,019
Go away!

1004
01:12:31,149 --> 01:12:32,807
It hurts.

1005
01:12:35,822 --> 01:12:37,894
You're not going to burn my leg?

1006
01:12:37,998 --> 01:12:38,925
It's the only way.

1007
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,436
To do what? You don't heal a dog bite
by burning the wound. That's torture.

1008
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:44,167
I'm telling you, I've already done it.

1009
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,139
You always think you know everything,
and you know nothing.

1010
01:12:47,246 --> 01:12:48,555
My father taught me how to do it.

1011
01:12:48,654 --> 01:12:51,239
It stops the bleeding,
it kills the germs, it dries the...

1012
01:12:51,342 --> 01:12:53,098
I don't know how to say it.

1013
01:12:53,197 --> 01:12:54,823
Cauterize.

1014
01:12:56,013 --> 01:12:58,501
You have to do it with the house key.

1015
01:12:58,605 --> 01:13:00,907
The house key?
What the hell are you talking about?

1016
01:13:01,005 --> 01:13:02,914
It keeps the bad spirits away.

1017
01:13:03,021 --> 01:13:05,160
Who cares about spirits?
I hope your dogs don't have rabies.

1018
01:13:05,261 --> 01:13:08,873
No danger. The vet comes
to check them every month.

1019
01:13:09,005 --> 01:13:11,242
My boss likes to do things well.

1020
01:13:11,342 --> 01:13:12,138
Let me see.

1021
01:13:12,237 --> 01:13:13,764
Stop it! Don't do that!

1022
01:13:15,149 --> 01:13:16,643
It's bad enough as it is.

1023
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,789
I don't believe in your stupid
remedies, anyway.

1024
01:13:18,893 --> 01:13:22,406
See, you say I'm suspicious, but
you're the one who doesn't trust me.

1025
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:23,589
It's not the same.

1026
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:53,194
I hope they won't need to amputate.

1027
01:13:53,293 --> 01:13:54,667
Would you sleep with me
if I only had one leg?

1028
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:56,074
Stop it, Sami.

1029
01:13:58,477 --> 01:14:00,812
If you could change one thing
when we have sex, what would it be?

1030
01:14:00,909 --> 01:14:03,298
Sex is something we do
but don't talk about.

1031
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:08,197
Your motorcycle is a beast.
How fast can it go?

1032
01:14:08,301 --> 01:14:09,730
1 25 mph on the freeway.

1033
01:14:09,837 --> 01:14:13,034
But you would have to go to Larache.
Around here you can't go that fast.

1034
01:14:13,133 --> 01:14:15,686
How did you pay for it?
Your loan story is phony.

1035
01:14:15,789 --> 01:14:16,487
It's a gift.

1036
01:14:16,589 --> 01:14:17,931
You won't tell me?

1037
01:14:18,029 --> 01:14:20,266
Stop it, Sami.
I don't owe you anything.

1038
01:14:21,197 --> 01:14:22,757
What time do we meet?

1039
01:14:22,861 --> 01:14:26,658
We won't meet today. I'm going back
to Paris. Nadia's not feeling well.

1040
01:14:26,765 --> 01:14:29,002
She's never well.
Why do you live with her?

1041
01:14:29,101 --> 01:14:31,273
I told you. Because we get along.

1042
01:14:31,373 --> 01:14:33,512
You always like to invent
chores for yourself.

1043
01:14:33,613 --> 01:14:38,599
She's a burden. She's nice, but she's
a burden. Give her a kiss for me.

1044
01:14:40,589 --> 01:14:44,647
Here. It's an open plane ticket
to Paris. It's round trip.

1045
01:14:44,749 --> 01:14:46,789
Come see me whenever you want.

1046
01:14:48,077 --> 01:14:50,248
I can't leave my job that easily.

1047
01:14:50,349 --> 01:14:53,545
Besides, remember last time?
It was a hassle to get a visa.

1048
01:14:55,021 --> 01:14:57,705
It took a while, but it worked. You
just need to do it ahead of time.

1049
01:14:57,806 --> 01:15:00,805
If you have proof that you're going
to stay with someone, it's easy.

1050
01:15:00,909 --> 01:15:03,113
I don't know. I'll think about it.
I can't promise you anything.

1051
01:15:03,214 --> 01:15:04,391
You know how I feel about Paris.

1052
01:15:04,493 --> 01:15:06,827
I would much rather be a prince here
than a bum over there.

1053
01:15:07,054 --> 01:15:08,482
You won't be a bum.

1054
01:15:16,717 --> 01:15:20,994
I should go.
I wish you many good things.

1055
01:15:21,102 --> 01:15:22,956
See you next time.

1056
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,709
How come you're already up?

1057
01:15:51,533 --> 01:15:53,289
I can't sleep.

1058
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:55,626
Well, it's a good thing.

1059
01:15:55,725 --> 01:15:59,980
Look. A dog bit me.
I took a taxi home.

1060
01:16:00,077 --> 01:16:03,143
I wanted to walk home, and bam!

1061
01:16:03,245 --> 01:16:05,634
Is it serious?

1062
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:06,635
No.

1063
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:09,416
Let's go to the pharmacy.
I'll give you a shot.

1064
01:16:13,165 --> 01:16:14,987
-You want some coffee?
-Yes.

1065
01:16:18,061 --> 01:16:20,200
What time is it?

1066
01:16:20,301 --> 01:16:22,919
Almost 7:00.
You still don't have a watch?

1067
01:16:27,053 --> 01:16:32,039
Said should wake up soon.
That kid always wakes up early.

1068
01:16:32,141 --> 01:16:34,858
I noticed. He is very quiet, though.

1069
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:36,299
He seems to be a very nice kid.

1070
01:16:40,781 --> 01:16:44,644
Not really. He won't let anyone
touch him, even his mother.

1071
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:50,637
He's timid. It will go away.

1072
01:17:00,269 --> 01:17:02,124
There are weather issues.
Don't wait here for two hours.

1073
01:17:02,221 --> 01:17:03,748
You should just go home.

1074
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:06,504
I would like to talk to you for
a while. We barely saw each other.

1075
01:17:06,605 --> 01:17:07,848
It's always like that.

1076
01:17:09,485 --> 01:17:11,175
I hope you don't mind, Nadia.
We're going to the cafe.

1077
01:17:11,277 --> 01:17:12,804
Not at all.

1078
01:17:14,605 --> 01:17:16,612
How's your job? You didn't tell me.

1079
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:20,132
It's all right.
With overtime, I make a living.

1080
01:17:20,237 --> 01:17:22,147
You don't look too motivated.
No regrets?

1081
01:17:22,253 --> 01:17:22,787
No.

1082
01:17:22,893 --> 01:17:23,820
Two coffees.

1083
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:25,510
I do regret having studied in France.

1084
01:17:25,613 --> 01:17:27,522
It would be hard
for me to find a job here.

1085
01:17:27,629 --> 01:17:29,003
Every time I come back here,
it's strange.

1086
01:17:29,101 --> 01:17:30,792
I don't know who I am anymore.

1087
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:31,657
Why do you say that?

1088
01:17:31,757 --> 01:17:35,369
Look at your father. He studied
medicine in Paris and he works here.

1089
01:17:35,469 --> 01:17:37,858
It's very different. He speaks Arabic,
and he's at home here.

1090
01:17:37,965 --> 01:17:42,155
Besides, medicine is the same
everywhere. Whereas law. . . .

1091
01:17:42,253 --> 01:17:43,562
I heard he was offered
twice his salary

1092
01:17:43,661 --> 01:17:44,708
to work in a hospital in Casablanca.

1093
01:17:44,813 --> 01:17:46,569
Why don't you want to go?

1094
01:17:46,669 --> 01:17:47,563
When did he tell you that?

1095
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:50,476
This morning. When he gave me
the anti-tetanus shot.

1096
01:17:50,573 --> 01:17:52,198
He's impossible.

1097
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:54,406
I didn't know it was a secret.
It's always the same with you.

1098
01:17:54,509 --> 01:17:56,418
You want to talk, and when we talk
you dramatize everything.

1099
01:17:56,525 --> 01:17:57,473
I am not dramatizing.

1100
01:17:57,581 --> 01:18:00,451
My job is here at the radio. If I go
to Casablanca, I lose it. That's all.

1101
01:18:00,557 --> 01:18:02,346
I don't understand
why you're clinging to this job.

1102
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,299
Considering how little you get paid.

1103
01:18:04,397 --> 01:18:07,212
I'm sure it would be good
for you both to have a new life.

1104
01:18:07,309 --> 01:18:09,676
You don't love him enough to say yes.

1105
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:11,627
You think women always
have to be the ones to yield?

1106
01:18:11,725 --> 01:18:13,514
Not particularly.

1107
01:18:13,613 --> 01:18:15,587
For instance, I am going
back to Paris for Nadia.

1108
01:18:15,693 --> 01:18:17,733
She looks better just knowing
she is leaving this country.

1109
01:18:17,837 --> 01:18:18,698
Did you notice?

1110
01:18:18,797 --> 01:18:21,186
It's not the same.
You're not attached to anyone here.

1111
01:18:21,293 --> 01:18:24,609
I do have someone.
Someone you don't know.

1112
01:18:26,861 --> 01:18:30,123
I don't know
if you're attached to anyone.

1113
01:18:30,221 --> 01:18:31,530
How can you say that?

1114
01:18:31,629 --> 01:18:34,280
You don't think I am able to love?

1115
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:35,875
I don't know.

1116
01:18:40,877 --> 01:18:42,121
Hello.

1117
01:18:44,973 --> 01:18:46,348
Antoine?

1118
01:18:50,093 --> 01:18:52,329
You look exhausted, Antoine.
Luckily, tomorrow is Sunday.

1119
01:18:52,429 --> 01:18:55,658
Unfortunately, we also work
on Sundays. We're late.

1120
01:18:57,837 --> 01:18:59,593
Do you have time to go have a drink?

1121
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:03,304
Look at me. I need to change.

1122
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,315
We'll be more comfortable
in your room.

1123
01:19:06,445 --> 01:19:09,063
If you say so. Come with me.

1124
01:19:17,261 --> 01:19:18,854
You have a nice view.

1125
01:19:25,037 --> 01:19:27,274
I wanted to call you,
but I didn't have your cell number.

1126
01:19:27,372 --> 01:19:31,563
Here. Help yourself.
I really need to take a shower.

1127
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:43,434
What are you doing?

1128
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:47,690
I don't want you to disappear.

1129
01:19:48,621 --> 01:19:49,701
I won't disappear, Antoine.

1130
01:19:49,804 --> 01:19:51,746
I'm the one who came to see you.
I'm happy to be here.

1131
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,155
But if you lock me in,
that's not a good start.

1132
01:20:01,613 --> 01:20:03,020
I know you saw Nathan the other night.

1133
01:20:03,117 --> 01:20:06,761
Yes. We just said hi, from far away.

1134
01:20:12,205 --> 01:20:14,855
Here is what I came to tell you,
Antoine.

1135
01:20:15,661 --> 01:20:18,695
Your love story with me doesn't exist.

1136
01:20:18,797 --> 01:20:21,252
It's easier to love someone in
your head and dream about them

1137
01:20:21,357 --> 01:20:22,982
than deal with them on a daily basis.

1138
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:25,256
You're like my friend Rachel.

1139
01:20:25,357 --> 01:20:27,048
Her lover lives in Rabat.

1140
01:20:27,148 --> 01:20:30,694
She talks to him on the phone every
day, but they never see each other.

1141
01:20:31,757 --> 01:20:33,350
There's a song about this.

1142
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:36,642
<i>I love you even more</i>
<i>When you're not here</i>

1143
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:38,407
<i>Because I can dream of you</i>

1144
01:20:42,573 --> 01:20:48,770
But see, I am here. I don't like
my body anymore. My life is a mess.

1145
01:20:48,876 --> 01:20:52,553
But I'm still fighting, even though
I lost control a little bit.

1146
01:20:53,901 --> 01:20:57,217
So what I'm suggesting is the opposite
of what you're offering me.

1147
01:20:57,325 --> 01:20:59,113
I can't commit
to spending my life with you,

1148
01:20:59,213 --> 01:21:00,707
but I'd like to rest
with you for a while.

1149
01:21:00,813 --> 01:21:05,220
Just a stop over.
And then, I'll go back to my life.

1150
01:21:05,325 --> 01:21:09,154
A stop over? What does that mean?

1151
01:21:09,261 --> 01:21:12,425
That's what I like best in life.
You forget the purpose of your trip.

1152
01:21:12,524 --> 01:21:17,314
You don't think about the itinerary
anymore. You stop to rest for a while.

1153
01:21:19,436 --> 01:21:22,436
All right. Let's stop over.

1154
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:28,227
I would really like to change now.
Did you see my clothes?

1155
01:21:28,332 --> 01:21:30,504
I talk too much. Sorry.

1156
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:58,819
Turn the light off.

1157
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:37,834
I couldn't miss you.
I mean, you really look like her.

1158
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:39,624
Sami insisted that I see you,

1159
01:22:39,724 --> 01:22:41,928
but he didn't tell me clearly
what the disease was.

1160
01:22:42,029 --> 01:22:43,174
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.

1161
01:22:43,277 --> 01:22:45,349
That way, we'll talk
about your mother in the car.

1162
01:22:45,453 --> 01:22:47,111
I don't want people in the
neighborhood to see me with a man.

1163
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:49,252
If they do,
they won't respect me anymore.

1164
01:22:49,357 --> 01:22:50,818
Would you prefer going to a cafe?

1165
01:22:50,925 --> 01:22:54,722
I am not like Nadia.
I don't go to cafes.

1166
01:22:55,436 --> 01:22:56,614
Let's walk a little bit, then.

1167
01:22:56,717 --> 01:22:58,986
In the street? Today is Sunday.

1168
01:22:59,084 --> 01:23:02,281
Everyone will look at us.
Can't we go somewhere quieter?

1169
01:23:05,036 --> 01:23:07,370
We'll try to find something.
Come with me.

1170
01:23:18,028 --> 01:23:19,555
Well, get in.

1171
01:23:31,116 --> 01:23:32,523
Help me.

1172
01:23:37,773 --> 01:23:40,523
With synthetic hormones,
it's all about the right dosage.

1173
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:42,246
Does she get her blood
analyzed regularly?

1174
01:23:42,349 --> 01:23:44,650
Yes, every month, she goes
to the hospital, in Tafraoute.

1175
01:23:44,749 --> 01:23:45,927
It's a little far, though.

1176
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:48,166
Where does she live, exactly?

1177
01:23:48,269 --> 01:23:51,498
In Taouz. That's where
Nadia and I were born.

1178
01:23:52,557 --> 01:23:56,201
I hear it was quite an event.
They had never seen twins before.

1179
01:23:57,132 --> 01:24:00,132
Taouz? I don't know where it is.

1180
01:24:00,237 --> 01:24:04,011
It's in the middle of nowhere,
in the Ziz Valley.

1181
01:24:04,108 --> 01:24:07,404
Some people know it because
of the stones falling from the sky.

1182
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,729
-Meteorites, right?
-Meteorites.

1183
01:24:10,828 --> 01:24:12,170
There are tons of them in the area.

1184
01:24:12,269 --> 01:24:15,564
They've been there for millions
of years. Nothing has moved.

1185
01:24:15,661 --> 01:24:17,286
There's no life. It's the desert.

1186
01:24:18,029 --> 01:24:19,622
This road isn't very good.

1187
01:24:19,724 --> 01:24:23,073
You wanted a quiet place.

1188
01:24:28,749 --> 01:24:31,204
-Do you have family in Tangiers?
-No.

1189
01:24:32,652 --> 01:24:34,343
I hope you go out, a little bit.

1190
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:36,932
No, I don't like places
where there are lots of people.

1191
01:24:37,037 --> 01:24:40,812
Nadia and I used to go to clubs.
She would dance. I never had fun.

1192
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,275
Now that she's gone,
I prefer being by myself.

1193
01:24:43,372 --> 01:24:45,609
That way, boys don't bother me.

1194
01:24:45,709 --> 01:24:49,025
If you lock yourself up like this,
you'll never meet anyone.

1195
01:24:49,132 --> 01:24:51,336
I don't want to meet anybody.

1196
01:24:51,437 --> 01:24:55,976
Men all want the same thing.
If you knew how much I hate them.

1197
01:24:56,077 --> 01:24:57,506
I see.

1198
01:24:57,612 --> 01:24:59,849
In fact, I see that
you don't know them.

1199
01:24:59,948 --> 01:25:01,475
I don't want to know them.

1200
01:25:03,405 --> 01:25:06,405
Will you be shocked
if I strip to a bathing suit?

1201
01:25:06,508 --> 01:25:07,272
No.

1202
01:25:07,372 --> 01:25:08,965
I like the way you laugh.

1203
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:11,011
You don't want to go in the water?

1204
01:25:11,116 --> 01:25:12,261
No, there's too much wind.

1205
01:25:12,364 --> 01:25:13,509
Besides, I would
have to take my clothes off.

1206
01:25:13,613 --> 01:25:15,304
Look around, there's nobody here.

1207
01:25:15,404 --> 01:25:16,965
Are you afraid of me?

1208
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:18,794
No.

1209
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:24,876
Look, the coast is clear today.
You can see Spain.

1210
01:25:28,492 --> 01:25:30,500
I'm starting to get hungry.

1211
01:25:41,453 --> 01:25:42,827
I thought you wanted to go for a swim.

1212
01:25:44,493 --> 01:25:45,737
I'll go, then.

1213
01:26:15,084 --> 01:26:16,393
Where's everybody?

1214
01:26:16,492 --> 01:26:17,736
You know, it's Sunday.

1215
01:26:17,837 --> 01:26:18,949
What do you mean, it's Sunday?

1216
01:26:19,053 --> 01:26:20,427
You know we need
to get things moving.

1217
01:26:21,036 --> 01:26:22,313
Why aren't they working?

1218
01:26:23,533 --> 01:26:24,939
Let's go!

1219
01:26:25,036 --> 01:26:26,629
Hurry up!

1220
01:26:58,828 --> 01:27:00,650
Hello. I have a meeting
with Antoine Lavau.

1221
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:01,763
I've been waiting for an hour.

1222
01:27:01,868 --> 01:27:02,981
Did he leave a message for me?

1223
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:04,164
One moment, please.

1224
01:27:04,269 --> 01:27:08,491
-There's a woman...
-Hold on a second.

1225
01:27:11,341 --> 01:27:12,802
-Hello.
-Hello.

1226
01:27:12,909 --> 01:27:14,763
Mr. Lavau had an accident.

1227
01:27:15,756 --> 01:27:16,617
An accident?

1228
01:27:16,749 --> 01:27:19,913
After the rain, part of the
construction site collapsed.

1229
01:27:20,012 --> 01:27:23,046
He's in the hospital.
I'll give you the address.

1230
01:27:39,181 --> 01:27:41,864
My son called me last night.

1231
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:45,642
He's going to spend Christmas in
a mountain cabin with some friends.

1232
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:49,889
Otherwise, I still work with Rachel.
We've put together a new proposal.

1233
01:27:49,997 --> 01:27:52,233
I hope they say yes to this one.

1234
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:56,260
I wonder if you can hear the rain.

1235
01:27:57,644 --> 01:27:59,749
It's my favorite noise.

1236
01:28:33,772 --> 01:28:36,806
I think he met someone,
but I didn't ask.

1237
01:28:39,116 --> 01:28:41,931
He moved all his belongings
to Casablanca.

1238
01:28:42,636 --> 01:28:46,859
I kept a bed, a coffee table
and the sofa chairs.

1239
01:28:46,956 --> 01:28:48,996
That's why I can't stay
for too long today.

1240
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:52,843
I need to be back by 5:00 pm
to wait for the workers.

1241
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:55,591
They're going to put all that stuff
in a storage space at Rachel's.

1242
01:28:55,692 --> 01:28:58,081
It will save me some money.

1243
01:29:00,044 --> 01:29:02,215
I'll have the same thing.

1244
01:29:02,316 --> 01:29:03,658
What's up?

1245
01:29:04,748 --> 01:29:06,406
They're taking him back to France.

1246
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:08,134
Really?

1247
01:29:08,236 --> 01:29:10,538
I didn't know you could transport
someone who is in a coma.

1248
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:12,676
They won't keep him in Tangiers.

1249
01:29:14,348 --> 01:29:16,487
They're transferring him to a special
clinic in Berck-sur-Mer,

1250
01:29:16,588 --> 01:29:18,377
in the Pas-de-Calais area.

1251
01:29:18,476 --> 01:29:19,752
When do they want to transfer him?

1252
01:29:19,852 --> 01:29:21,412
As soon as possible.

1253
01:29:21,516 --> 01:29:23,938
They're saying it doesn't make sense
to keep him here any longer.

1254
01:29:24,044 --> 01:29:25,866
Is someone going with him?

1255
01:29:25,964 --> 01:29:28,069
Yes. I'm going.

1256
01:29:28,173 --> 01:29:30,540
He didn't have any friends of family?

1257
01:29:30,636 --> 01:29:33,003
I don't like it when you talk
about him in the past.

1258
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,042
I've never seen a man like him.

1259
01:29:35,149 --> 01:29:36,937
What do you mean?

1260
01:29:37,517 --> 01:29:40,964
Usually, women are the ones
to fall madly in love like that.

1261
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:48,129
<i>Rachel decided to make</i>
<i>a Christmas tree this year.</i>

1262
01:29:48,236 --> 01:29:50,210
<i>She wanted to get an early start.</i>

1263
01:29:50,957 --> 01:29:55,463
<i>This morning, we got up early.</i>
<i>The weather was nice.</i>

1264
01:29:55,564 --> 01:29:57,604
<i>We went to Missnana. You remember?</i>

1265
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:59,050
<i>That's the forest</i>
<i>where I showed you the house.</i>

1266
01:29:59,149 --> 01:30:01,189
<i>The illegal immigrants</i>
<i>were still there.</i>

1267
01:30:01,292 --> 01:30:02,056
<i>Maybe they were different ones.</i>

1268
01:30:02,156 --> 01:30:04,098
<i>They try their best to be anonymous,</i>
<i>so it's hard to know.</i>

1269
01:30:04,204 --> 01:30:05,448
You should have seen Rachel and me

1270
01:30:05,548 --> 01:30:08,134
dragging the Christmas tree
for 200 yards.

1271
01:30:08,845 --> 01:30:10,601
By the way, we had a hard time

1272
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,227
fitting the furniture
in the storage space yesterday.

1273
01:30:12,333 --> 01:30:14,405
Especially the bed. It was too big.

1274
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:17,415
I found this
underneath the box springs.

1275
01:30:18,508 --> 01:30:20,296
That was a crazy thing to do.

1276
01:30:20,396 --> 01:30:22,567
I wanted to tear it apart.
I didn't sleep all night.

1277
