1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,633
<i>It's hard to believe, but once there was
a world without Charlie Chaplin.</i>

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,194
<i>Then one day in 1914, a strange new
face and form emerged from the crowd.</i>

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,159
<i>Kid Auto Races at Venice,
an iconography was born.</i>

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,757
Chaplin's persona is so rich
and such a weave of so many things.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,959
But he also just has this desperate need
to be in front of the camera.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,759
<i>That's the gag, him enjoying
being in front of the camera.</i>

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,959
They push him aside so they can see the
auto races they're ostensibly filming.

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,635
<i>He keeps coming back,
and he wants to be there.</i>

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,837
That desire to be in front of a machine...

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,515
<i>...that gets you in front of people that
he harnessed, partly out of wisdom.</i>

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,432
Maybe he never knew
what he was doing.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,639
<i>He just harnessed that desire
to be seen, to be the center.</i>

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,360
<i>He was 24. He'd been on-stage...</i>

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,239
<i>...mostly in English music halls,
since he was 10.</i>

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,353
<i>Mack Sennett hired him for the movies
out of Fred Karno's company...</i>

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,559
<i>...then touring America,
for $ 150 a week.</i>

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,473
<i>This was his third film,
the second to be released...</i>

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,150
<i>...but the first in which he appeared
in his immortal Tramp costume.</i>

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,629
<i>Chaplin always said he improvised it
on the spot...</i>

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,190
<i>...using clothing he found
lying around the studio.</i>

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,829
<i>In the next three years, Chaplin
would make 62 short films...</i>

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,629
<i>...writing and directing
the last 26 himself.</i>

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,555
<i>By 1917, he was becoming, thanks
to this new, universal medium...</i>

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,952
<i>...the greatest comic icon
the world had ever known.</i>

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,351
<i>The films were fast, funny,
seemingly casual...</i>

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,512
<i>...yet ever more complex
in construction.</i>

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,148
<i>But the icon was still in search
of the iconographic sequences...</i>

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,436
<i>...that would define his genius.</i>

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,433
<i>They would come to him
in the years ahead slowly...</i>

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,750
<i>...often enough painfully.</i>

31
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,555
<i>Amid the distractions of being
the most famous man in the world...</i>

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,751
<i>...he always felt the pressure
to do more.</i>

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,230
<i>He would feel the need to speak
to the yearning human heart.</i>

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,073
<i>He would feel the need to speak
from his own heart...</i>

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,518
<i>...about the dehumanization of labor
in Modern Times...</i>

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,549
<i>...or about the looming threat of
fascism, personified by a monster...</i>

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,632
<i>...who bore an uncanny resemblance,
which everyone noticed...</i>

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,950
<i>...to his own beloved Tramp.</i>

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,751
<i>Yet always there was the terrible need
to be as funny as ever...</i>

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,436
<i>...to command the audience's laughter,
its affectionate delight...</i>

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,160
<i>...and, yes, its most basic sentiments
as well.</i>

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,757
<i>The pressures were relentless,
all-consuming...</i>

43
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,916
<i>...and to the still youthful Chaplin
of The Kid, not yet fully imaginable.</i>

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,759
<i>Thirty-one years after The Kid,
Chaplin made Limelight.</i>

46
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,356
<i>It was set in 1914,
the year he made his first movie...</i>

47
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,751
<i>...and the year World War I
blew away the Edwardian world...</i>

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,038
<i>...in which he was raised
and knew his first success.</i>

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,431
<i>It's about a famous comedian
whose once simple, perfect rapport...</i>

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,034
<i>...with his audience has been lost.</i>

51
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,714
<i>Phyllis, Henry!</i>

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,038
<i>Phyllis, Henry, stop that!
What do you think you're doing?</i>

53
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,512
<i>You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,
fighting like that.</i>

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,554
<i>All right, Phyllis, you stay in the box.
Henry, hurry up!</i>

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,235
<i>One night after dinner,
we were seated rather late...</i>

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,472
...and Charlie and I were there.
He was going through a book...

57
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,631
...of comedians.

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,837
And he came across a picture
of his father...

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,639
...who was standing very much
as Chaplin stood...

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,234
...with the cane and the hand
on the hip.

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,757
<i>And he said, "You know, he lost
the ability to make people laugh.</i>

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,155
And there have been comics
who have this terrible dream...

63
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,638
<i>...that they're performing,
and they do something...</i>

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,238
<i>...that should get a laugh. And they
look out to this black, cavernous space.</i>

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,949
<i>And there's not a sound, not a laugh. "</i>

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,717
<i>Then he paused. He said,
"I have this dream, recurring dream. "</i>

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,396
<i>Like his Calvero, Chaplin himself
had lost his audience.</i>

68
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,034
<i>The fine, careless rapture
of their beginnings...</i>

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,318
<i>...soured by political
and moral criticism of him.</i>

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,828
<i>Limelight is, emotionally speaking,
his most autobiographical film...</i>

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,834
<i>...for no star ever more desperately
needed his audience.</i>

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,754
<i>It's this hunger for the crowd
and this fear of the crowd...</i>

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,514
<i>...that drove this life.</i>

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,356
You can draw a caricature of Chaplin
with just a couple of brushstrokes...

75
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,636
...and you know who you're alluding to.

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,270
The graphic of his body
was just so arresting.

77
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,558
And he was a smart guy. He had
dark hair. He darkened his eyebrows.

78
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,349
Put that mustache on there.
That hat framed things.

79
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,273
Choosing of big shoes pointing outward.

80
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,314
The body was always a shape
that you could identify.

81
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,592
<i>In the Bronx, when I was very much
into the break-dance scene...</i>

82
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,429
...you'd meet a young kid who might not
be able to describe Chaplin to you...

83
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,636
...but he had a step
they called the Charlie.

84
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,031
<i>And it was- You know, it was
obviously taken from Chaplin.</i>

85
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,510
So he's in our cultural heritage
whether we're conscious of him or not.

86
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,750
<i>Limelight was not Chaplin's first
filmed evocation of his music-hall past.</i>

87
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,517
<i>In 1915, he re-created his great Karno
success, Mumming Birds, on film.</i>

88
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,037
<i>For the movie, he invented
a second character for himself to play...</i>

89
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,350
<i>...a tipsy, touchy citizen
of the balcony...</i>

90
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,399
<i>...quick to register his displeasure
with the performance.</i>

91
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,558
<i>If he feared the audience's indifference,
he equally feared its volatility...</i>

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,234
<i>...which this figure personified.</i>

93
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,709
<i>The music-hall audience
was a tough one.</i>

94
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,236
<i>This movie only slightly exaggerates
the disdain it could instantly mobilize.</i>

95
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,359
<i>For Karno, Chaplin had played
the equally tipsy swell in the box...</i>

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,633
<i>...whose need to dominate the stage
matched Chaplin's.</i>

97
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,354
The thing I remember
from his autobiography...

98
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,149
<i>...is the extraordinary account.
He's like 5 or 6, I think.</i>

99
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,031
<i>And he goes on, really, when his mother
cracks up, breaks down, on-stage.</i>

100
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,159
And his mother had been
a performer of some reputation.

101
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,432
And the way he describes it...

102
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,230
...it isn't simply that he goes on
to rescue his mother...

103
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,039
...although I think that was part of it.

104
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,310
There's almost the rivalry
with the mother.

105
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,719
And there's almost that feeling
that performance...

106
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,232
...is the emotional core of the man.

107
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,358
<i>In theaters, Chaplin won admirers...</i>

108
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,353
<i>...a few hundred at a time
over many months.</i>

109
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,876
<i>The movies offered him audiences
in their millions over just a few weeks.</i>

110
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,437
<i>But the demand for fresh material
was relentless and cruel.</i>

111
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,717
<i>What Chaplin did for Keystone,
you can see just fleetingly in moments.</i>

112
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,869
There's no aggregate transformation
to great Chaplin.

113
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,469
<i>Little bits of business
like in Dough and Dynamite...</i>

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,798
...where he makes doughnuts by flinging
dough around his wrists.

115
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,953
<i>These are moments that no one else was
doing, that endeared him to the public.</i>

116
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,473
It's his early Sennett ones.

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,592
<i>In those things, you felt
he was...</i>

118
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,150
...feeling his way. He hadn't reached
that point of domination.

119
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,954
That was one of the most valuable
things Chaplin did.

120
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,071
He came in to work
with the Keystone Kops.

121
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,955
He showed them how to not be breaking
their tailbones every third week.

122
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,953
They had never learned how to fall.
It was like jump school.

123
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,557
<i>What's fascinating at Keystone,
if you look carefully at the films...</i>

124
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,632
<i>...once he started to direct them,
he's gone to school.</i>

125
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,950
<i>There's one lovely film,
not very important...</i>

126
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,354
...but he discovered you could cut.
You could actually...

127
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,114
...throw somebody out of the screen
in one shot...

128
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,590
<i>...and then have them come in,
in the next shot.</i>

129
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,676
<i>The studio sought him out after Tillie's
Punctured Romance, a huge hit...</i>

130
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,628
<i>...the first feature-length comedy. It had
a huge stage star, Marie Dressler...</i>

131
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,956
...and had incredible distribution.

132
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,755
<i>Tillie's Punctured Romance
isn't a Chaplin film.</i>

133
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,957
<i>It was directed by Sennett,
and Chaplin didn't think much of it.</i>

134
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,031
But he enjoyed working
with Marie Dressler.

135
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,033
And it really established him
on a really grand scale...

136
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,959
...so that after 35 films
he could announce to Mack Sennett:

137
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,516
<i>"All I need to make a comedy is a park,
a policeman and a pretty girl. "</i>

138
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,949
<i>The public had begun to notice
Chaplin even before Tillie.</i>

139
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,599
<i>He was on his way...</i>

140
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,554
<i>...first to George Spoor and "Broncho
Billy" Anderson's Essanay Company...</i>

141
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,349
<i>...1250 a week
and a $ 10,000 bonus.</i>

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,436
<i>Tramps were everywhere in show
business at the turn of the last century.</i>

143
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,433
<i>There were tramp comics,
jugglers, singers...</i>

144
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,037
<i>...mildly discomfiting outsiders
to the middle class audience.</i>

145
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,636
<i>But none had Chaplin's delicacy
or winsomeness...</i>

146
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,555
<i>...or his ability to convey slightly
subversive thought through pantomime.</i>

147
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,511
<i>His costume and makeup made him at
once an abstract and a universal figure.</i>

148
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,237
<i>The gags might still be as crude
as this bop on the head...</i>

149
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,631
<i>...but only Chaplin would think
of planting on his victim's forehead...</i>

150
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,553
<i>...a sweet little good-night kiss.</i>

151
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,957
<i>He had a unique gift for turning
a simple object into something else.</i>

152
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,556
<i>This palm-frond toothbrush
is an early example.</i>

153
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,350
The great thing that happened
for Charlie Chaplin at Essanay...

154
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,152
...was that he began to be able
to experiment with his own creativity...

155
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,790
...in a way that was going
to make him an artist.

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,036
All the things that
he's going to develop...

157
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,955
...and become as an artist...

158
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,079
...he gets the chance to play with
and try in 1915.

159
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,434
<i>Chaplin goes over to Essanay to do
his first film, His New Job...</i>

160
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,116
...which is a kind of slap at Keystone.

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,560
<i>The fictional studio
was called Lockstone.</i>

162
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,631
<i>Its director, played
by Charles Inslee...</i>

163
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,190
<i>...bears a suspicious resemblance
to Mack Sennett.</i>

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,956
<i>Chaplin wasn't always the Tramp.</i>

165
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,354
<i>A Woman was not the first time
he played, quite fetchingly, in drag.</i>

166
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,514
We're gonna have the cutting in
to medium when something is needed.

167
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,752
<i>And in The Bank we're gonna have
the "give the rose to the leading lady"...</i>

168
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,992
...have the little sad moment.

169
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,113
We're gonna have the superimpositions
of imagined things.

170
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,309
We're gonna have
the "it was all a dream. "

171
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,750
<i>And in Work, there's
this astonishing image...</i>

172
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,152
...of him pulling a big cart
with one big man riding in it...

173
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,551
<i>...up a lonely, bleak hill.
And you look at this, and you think:</i>

174
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,191
"Where are we here?
Are we in an Ingmar Bergman movie?"

175
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,439
<i>In A Night Out, you see
these two playing drunks...</i>

176
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,151
<i>...absolute perfection.
The whole thing is, "We're drunk.</i>

177
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,039
<i>We must not fall down, however. "</i>

178
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,556
He's working with Ben Turpin as a unit.

179
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,957
<i>The two of them, physically,
are paired impeccably.</i>

180
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,716
<i>So here's Chaplin able to come over,
get a new job at a new place...</i>

181
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,352
...define himself comically
and use another chosen comic actor...

182
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,229
...who perfectly suits
what he wants to do.

183
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,634
I love the Essanays...

184
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,630
...because they're so completely
and utterly street comedies.

185
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,749
<i>In By the Sea, he and his adversary
are busy on the beach...</i>

186
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,559
<i>...socking one another, falling down.</i>

187
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,439
<i>In the long shot, in the distance...</i>

188
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,354
...a lone swimmer goes down
to test the water.

189
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,034
<i>I mean, he's oblivious
that a movie's being shot.</i>

190
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,239
<i>You're looking at people
out in the frame, over there...</i>

191
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,119
...living their lives
and doing what they do.

192
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,149
<i>Discovering the range of film's possibility
at Essanay studio in Niles, California...</i>

193
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,552
<i>...Chaplin made a discovery
of another kind: Edna Purviance.</i>

194
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,111
<i>A former secretary, she always seemed
on-screen a real girl, not a glamour girl.</i>

195
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,957
<i>Chaplin was enchanted. Edna would
make 35 films with him.</i>

196
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,315
<i>She became the first
of the three great loves...</i>

197
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,159
<i>...of his maturity.</i>

198
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,552
<i>Edna Purviance, who really wasn't
much of a professional actress...</i>

199
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,838
...comes into these films and completely
holds down her corner of it.

200
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,434
<i>Whatever is asked of her, she can do.</i>

201
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,957
But she's obviously someone
he respected...

202
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,032
...and treated more as an equal.

203
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,353
<i>In The Tramp, the film opens.
There he is in the Tramp outfit.</i>

204
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,036
He's on a lonely road. He's doing
his little waddle down the road.

205
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,239
You see the prototypical
Charlie Chaplin.

206
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,952
This is recognizably who we accept
as the Chaplin image.

207
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,636
He has a little whiskbroom that he takes
out and cleans the dust off himself...

208
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,349
<i>...when a car goes by,
but the camera needs to serve him.</i>

209
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,637
It needs to come up close
so he can dust out his pocket.

210
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,316
<i>So, what you see is, he's taken
control of the camera.</i>

211
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,029
<i>The film was prototypical
in another way.</i>

212
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,228
<i>Despite his confident air,
Charlie's Tramp will not get the girl.</i>

213
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,231
<i>Her heart belongs to another.</i>

214
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,070
<i>Chaplin would almost always lose out
to normally handsome...</i>

215
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,396
<i>...normally well-dressed guys.</i>

216
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,348
<i>It was one of his points of reference
with his audience.</i>

217
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,830
<i>The ending of The Tramp, it doesn't
resolve. He does not get the girl.</i>

218
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,955
He turns away and walks away
from the camera on a lonely road...

219
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,918
...heading toward the horizon.

220
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,914
Here is where the Tramp and Chaplin
really do come together.

221
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,989
<i>There was another coming together
in those years...</i>

222
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,469
<i>...a reunion with his beloved
half-brother Sydney.</i>

223
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,677
<i>He's the patron at the bar
in this Sennett comedy.</i>

224
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,308
<i>Chaplin helped him get a contract
with the studio.</i>

225
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:06,236
<i>A star in the English movie halls,
he was an adept movie comedian.</i>

226
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,995
<i>In one sentence, I'll tell you
about the elder Sydney.</i>

227
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,757
<i>Charlie said about him, "He was
never impressed by anything. "</i>

228
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,232
<i>Not, certainly, by the men in suits
from the Mutual Film Corporation.</i>

229
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,437
<i>Sydney helped Chaplin get a raise
to $ 10,000 a week...</i>

230
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,434
<i>...plus a signing bonus of $ 150,000.</i>

231
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,551
<i>His 12 Mutual films
of 1916 and 1917...</i>

232
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,958
<i>...contain his first truly
immortal gags...</i>

233
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,032
<i>...like the escalator sequence
from the first, The Floorwalker.</i>

234
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,237
<i>We sometimes forget the risks
the silent comedians ran...</i>

235
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,755
<i>...as they courted our laughter.</i>

236
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,150
<i>There are no nets available
to the fireman...</i>

237
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,551
<i>...but this thrill sequence was
only a beginning for Chaplin.</i>

238
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,154
<i>What's truly wonderful
about his Mutual films...</i>

239
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,872
<i>...is the ever increasing length, intricacy
and subtlety of his gag sequences.</i>

240
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,235
<i>This man had skill, unimaginable skill.</i>

241
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,551
He was a superhero.

242
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,439
He was the most endearing superhero...

243
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,912
...you could ever want to watch.

244
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,229
<i>One A.M., which is a 18-minute-
The whole short...</i>

245
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,630
...with the guy just trying
to get into bed.

246
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,112
If you took a performer and that
was the only thing they ever did...

247
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,514
...that would be enough.

248
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,116
<i>Yet he did it again and again and
innovated and, I mean, you know...</i>

249
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,234
<i>You know, in the '80s,
I was thinking about Chaplin a lot...</i>

250
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,359
...and I talked to a video-store guy.
And he said:

251
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,354
<i>"You can put anything on the monitor
in the window, and people will pass by.</i>

252
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,115
<i>But if you put Chaplin,
people will stop. "</i>

253
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,751
If you're walking along the sidewalk
and see a black-and-white image...

254
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,230
<i>...first of all, the black-and-
white image is so arresting.</i>

255
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,758
And you see this almost flickers
maybe like an abstract of action.

256
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,354
<i>The moment you stop,
you see it as a human being...</i>

257
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,036
<i>...but a wild, like a flailing version
of a human being.</i>

258
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,350
<i>I'm thinking of a movie like The Rink...</i>

259
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,035
<i>...Chaplin and his great foil,
Eric Campbell, a big guy.</i>

260
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,159
<i>They're on skates. They do this stuff,
and people just stop and look at that...</i>

261
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,312
...because the abandon with which
people are falling backwards...

262
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,631
<i>...falling forward on the skates,
just perfectly still.</i>

263
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,837
There's a rhythm there
between wild abandon...

264
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,551
<i>...and it almost, like, mirrors
social control.</i>

265
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,032
<i>Something wild,
and then there's hell to civilize...</i>

266
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,156
<i>...and then back, of course, to wild.</i>

267
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,869
<i>Chaplin the Tramp,
he tried to keep up appearances.</i>

268
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,834
He never settled that
to be slovenly and tramp-like.

269
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,759
He pretended that he had
social aspirations.

270
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,439
<i>In Easy Street he plays
a paroled convict...</i>

271
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,718
<i>...who will eventually become
an unlikely policeman.</i>

272
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,634
<i>The very title, Easy Street,
suggests East Street...</i>

273
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,950
...which is the street
on which he was born.

274
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,237
That wonderful evocation
of South London.

275
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,233
The police are avoiding Easy Street...

276
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,039
...and it takes a tramp
to clean up the violence.

277
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,033
It takes one of them to clean it up.

278
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,759
<i>As the cop, he tries
to subdue the bully...</i>

279
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,037
...and he uses his truncheon
to hit him on the head.

280
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,236
And he hits him and hits him
and hits him.

281
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,312
No effect. It's like a nightmare.

282
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,149
<i>And then, in a display of strength,
the bully bends down a gas lamppost...</i>

283
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,314
...and that's Charlie's opportunity
to jump on his back and gas him.

284
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,549
<i>This set design, one street crossed
by another to form a T...</i>

285
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,837
<i>...was based on a street
where Chaplin had lived as a boy.</i>

286
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,560
<i>He would use the design
in many pictures.</i>

287
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,236
<i>Memories of London's East End
scored every aspect of his work.</i>

288
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,960
It's as great as it was years ago.

289
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,237
<i>I mean, it's just a wonderful,
wonderful short...</i>

290
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,436
...because it'll always be funny.
It'll be funny 1000 years from now.

291
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,553
<i>In 1916, the press reported a nationwide
Chaplin impulse or celebrity craze.</i>

292
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,635
<i>It didn't comment on some of the very
odd impulses that moved his character.</i>

293
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,233
There's an exquisite ladylike
daintiness to him very often...

294
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,757
...and I think that women
in one way appealed to him...

295
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,153
<i>...for that way of moving, that rather
hesitant, fluttery way of moving.</i>

296
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,471
He does it a lot. He simpers.

297
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,638
I don't think Chaplin was
a simperer in real life...

298
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,636
<i>...but he was fascinated by, you know,
this sort of little coy shake of the head...</i>

299
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,950
...as a seductive measure.

300
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,156
I'm not even sure women
really act like that.

301
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,154
<i>Certainly, uncomplicated Edna didn't.</i>

302
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,676
<i>She was, just then, very much
a part of his happiness.</i>

303
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,758
<i>Never thereafter would Chaplin's life
be as uncomplicated...</i>

304
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,434
<i>...as it was during his year with Mutual.</i>

305
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,956
<i>They did love each other dearly,
and there was a motherly quality...</i>

306
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,749
<i>...along with her luminous beauty,
that attracted Chaplin to Edna.</i>

307
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,639
I think she was placid
and a calming force...

308
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,755
...as opposed to his rather demanding
and high-energized personality.

309
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,708
The relationship with Edna Purviance
is something very interesting in his life.

310
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,791
<i>Obviously, Edna meant
a great deal to him.</i>

311
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,430
She must have been
an enchanting woman...

312
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,433
...and I think that this satisfied
something in him very much.

313
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,273
They did have a very close
and passionate relationship...

314
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,553
...for two or three years.
Women got jealous of the work...

315
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,598
<i>...because when he was working,
he didn't have time for anybody.</i>

316
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,156
Every woman in his life became
a little bit jealous of the work...

317
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,835
...and probably Edna did.
And she had a flirtation...

318
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,719
...and this was too much for Charlie.

319
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,798
Things went wrong after that.

320
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,311
<i>Things were still going right
for them...</i>

321
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,751
<i>...when Chaplin made The Immigrant
in 1917.</i>

322
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,630
<i>It was often broadly funny, yet also
one of his most complex films to date.</i>

323
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,554
<i>It would sympathetically take up an issue
that had troubled America for years...</i>

324
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,396
<i>...the tidal wave of lower class
European immigration.</i>

325
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,231
What other film at the time
do you have...

326
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,709
...where half the film is set
on an immigrant boat?

327
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,796
<i>And certainly, it's a comic view of it,
but it is about immigration.</i>

328
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,595
<i>It was, as well,
an innocently romantic film.</i>

329
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,351
<i>The line was, "We don't like
this going after the girl...</i>

330
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,318
...and mooning after women.
We don't like that Chaplin.

331
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,239
We like the Chaplin
of the earlier shorts. "

332
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,516
They say the same thing
about Woody Allen.

333
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,871
<i>The thing that lingers in your mind with
the character the Tramp, Little Tramp...</i>

334
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,559
<i>...is the sweetness, you know...</i>

335
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,594
<i>...that innocence, that purity.
But at the same time...</i>

336
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,955
<i>...there is that other side,
that rascal.</i>

337
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,429
<i>I remember watching The Immigrant
again recently...</i>

338
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,558
...and for a second being really stunned.

339
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,551
Chaplin is playing cards.

340
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,510
<i>He loans a guy money, and the guy
gives him his pistol as collateral.</i>

341
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,629
<i>And when Chaplin wins,
the guy gets violent.</i>

342
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,394
And I was stunned when Chaplin
pulls the gun on him...

343
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,149
<i>...and gives him this look, like, "Hey! "
You know, just for that second.</i>

344
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,791
<i>And then he immediately goes back
to this pure being, this innocent thing.</i>

345
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,634
<i>He was ever willing to kick
authority in the pants...</i>

346
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,749
<i>...though genteel America muttered
disapproval of his anarchic side.</i>

347
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,436
I think we've definitely
lost comic patience.

348
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,989
<i>Everything needs to be now,
and what those guys did-</i>

349
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,038
<i>I mean, what Chaplin was
able to do was milk a gag...</i>

350
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,159
...and really stretch it out
and really draw it out.

351
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,630
<i>Even if you knew what the result
was gonna be, it was still hilarious.</i>

352
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,988
It's the starving Tramp walking outside
a restaurant looking at the door...

353
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,034
<i>...you know, thinking, "God, I'd love
to go in and have a meal there. "</i>

354
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,158
<i>He picks up the coin on the ground,
dumps it in his pocket...</i>

355
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,317
...heads towards the restaurant.
Ding! It hits the ground.

356
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,750
<i>He goes inside, has his meal.</i>

357
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,230
Some guy walks in holding
the coin that he dropped.

358
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,350
<i>That gag lasts for, I don't know,
seven, eight minutes, and you're there.</i>

359
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,875
You can't take your eyes off him.

360
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,629
<i>You need more than comedy, more
than laughs, to make a feature film.</i>

361
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,517
A feature film has to have some kind
of an emotional string to it.

362
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,791
Chaplin called it his favorite two-reeler.

363
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,757
<i>In fact, in one of his later books...</i>

364
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,032
<i>...he said The Immigrant touched him
more than any film he made.</i>

365
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,796
<i>He liked the ending in particular,
that these two young immigrants...</i>

366
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,037
...getting married on a rainy day.
He thought it was very poetic.

367
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,830
<i>I, frankly, prefer the longer,
more ambitious Chaplin films...</i>

368
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,116
...even to the funniest
of the early films.

369
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,029
<i>Comedy transposition,
the idea of one thing suggests another...</i>

370
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,590
<i>...was not unique to Chaplin,
but it was one of his great gifts.</i>

371
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,557
<i>The Pawnshop is a great example of that
where, as a pawnbroker's assistant...</i>

372
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,679
<i>...he's asked to look at an alarm clock.
And of course, in his hands...</i>

373
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,559
...he becomes the doctor
and the clock becomes his patient.

374
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,035
<i>Late, middle, early Chaplin, his gift for
transforming one object into another...</i>

375
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,237
<i>...remained central to his comic genius.</i>

376
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,958
<i>These transformations...</i>

377
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,351
<i>...deliberate manipulations
of our perceptions of the real...</i>

378
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,750
<i>...were also central to modernity...</i>

379
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,710
<i>...with its fluid, ever-changing
definitions of what constitutes reality.</i>

380
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,753
This idea of transformation
goes back right to the start.

381
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,151
I can't quite think where it comes from.
Everything he looked at...

382
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,437
...suggested the possibility
of something else.

383
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,230
My favorite one is where he has to move
a whole heap of bentwood chairs...

384
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,233
...and so he puts them all on his back.
He becomes a hedgehog.

385
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,914
I just think that's wonderful.

386
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,431
He could certainly
bring things to life...

387
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,559
...bring something inanimate
and static and give it life...

388
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,631
...give it some kind of movement
and life.

389
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,433
And that was certainly
a great gift that he had.

390
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,037
<i>Old-fashioned man that he was, Chaplin
would have denied being a surrealist.</i>

391
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,193
<i>But unconsciously, that's what he was.</i>

392
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,471
<i>Who else would have thought of turning
a massage into a wrestling match?</i>

393
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,318
<i>Or a fire engine
into a cappuccino machine?</i>

394
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,757
<i>"All that is solid melts into air, "
Karl Marx said.</i>

395
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,072
<i>In Chaplin, all that seems solid
melts into something else.</i>

396
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,559
<i>Of his many gifts, this one is among
his most enduring and endearing...</i>

397
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,511
<i>...sophisticated visions converted
into playful, childlike action.</i>

398
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,239
<i>Skeptical Sydney was one
of Charlie's perfect comic foils.</i>

399
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,710
<i>But he remained even better at business.</i>

400
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,997
<i>His year at Mutual ending, Chaplin
received an attractive overture...</i>

401
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,957
<i>...from First National.</i>

402
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,511
<i>This time, the Chaplins had
a very firm ideal in mind.</i>

403
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,153
They asked him to come to New York
to negotiate a deal...

404
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,153
...and so he got on the train
with Sydney...

405
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,550
...who was going to do
the negotiating for him.

406
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,030
<i>And he said to Sydney "All right,
Sydney, you go in, and you negotiate.</i>

407
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,031
And you know I want a million dollars. "

408
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,432
<i>Sydney said "All right, now as for you,
if you're going to play your violin...</i>

409
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,434
...you gotta stay in the bathroom
and play because it's terrible. "

410
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,559
<i>So Charlie went in the bathroom,
stood in the tub, empty of water...</i>

411
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,315
...and played his violin to soothe himself
while Sydney went down the corridor.

412
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,953
<i>He came back, and he said
"Charlie, they're offering $500,000. "</i>

413
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,830
<i>Charlie said, "We're not gonna
even talk to them about that.</i>

414
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,356
<i>You gotta go back. "
He went back, 600,000.</i>

415
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,351
"You gotta go back. " He went back.

416
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,556
<i>And finally he came back, and he said:</i>

417
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,635
<i>"Charlie, they've come up to $ 750,000
and not a nickel more. "</i>

418
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,432
<i>And Charlie, bowing away, said,
"Tell them I am an artist.</i>

419
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,832
<i>I know nothing about money.
All I know is, I want a million dollars. "</i>

420
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,550
<i>And Sydney went back,
and he came running back in. He said:</i>

421
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,429
<i>"Charlie, throw away your violin.
Get yourself a bull fiddle.</i>

422
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,158
You got a million dollars. "

423
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,634
<i>He began building a studio
in the groves of La Brea Avenue.</i>

424
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,352
<i>Chaplin created this time-lapse
sequence for a promotional short.</i>

425
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,956
<i>His dream studio took the form of
a poor English lad's dream of luxury...</i>

426
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,031
<i>...suburban London façades.</i>

427
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,834
<i>Think of it. In a matter
of three years...</i>

428
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,551
<i>...Charles Spencer Chaplin, age 28,
had become a millionaire...</i>

429
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,757
<i>...and one of the world's
most famous people.</i>

430
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,230
<i>Most important to him,
his First National deal granted him...</i>

431
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,359
<i>...absolute control over his films
and his own destiny.</i>

432
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,799
<i>In all of movie history, no rise
was ever more meteoric than his.</i>

433
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,349
He had to give them the performance
because he knew better than anyone...

434
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,035
...what he wanted and what he
needed from the actor...

435
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,430
...and the best way to do it
was to show.

436
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,352
And this isn't very much different...

437
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,318
...from what an actor/manager
did in the English music halls.

438
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,237
This is standard practice of what Chaplin
knew. The actor was also the director.

439
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,233
Chaplin was not necessarily
a terribly articulate man.

440
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,436
He was just a Cockney lad.

441
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,628
<i>And I think he had trouble with words,
particularly in his early days.</i>

442
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,839
The easiest way to tell someone how to
do something was just to show them...

443
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,959
<i>...because no one was more articulate
than Chaplin, physically.</i>

444
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,759
<i>He has his own studio, his own team.</i>

445
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,356
<i>He can take as much time as he likes,
which is really what he wanted.</i>

446
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,636
Chaplin didn't just use the first shot.

447
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,758
He would take a shot not twice
or three times...

448
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,957
...but he would take a shot
20 times if he was to get it right.

449
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,429
This was something completely new.

450
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,160
<i>So was this. In Spring, 1918...</i>

451
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,437
<i>...with America now a combatant
in World War I...</i>

452
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,034
<i>...Chaplin and the movies '
other greatest stars...</i>

453
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,191
<i>...Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks...</i>

454
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,631
<i>...embarked on a personal appearance
tour selling Liberty Bonds.</i>

455
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,954
<i>It was the first major demonstration of
movie stardom's unprecedented power.</i>

456
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,351
<i>Everywhere they went, the crowds
were vast and impassioned.</i>

457
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,239
<i>They sold millions of dollars '
worth of bonds.</i>

458
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,630
<i>The tour was especially important
for Chaplin.</i>

459
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,758
<i>He had come under the first
personal criticism of his life...</i>

460
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,639
<i>...for not enlisting in the English army.</i>

461
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,031
<i>Mostly this came from the press,
trying to create a scandal.</i>

462
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,350
<i>Chaplin professed his willingness
to serve...</i>

463
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,717
<i>...but the British government knew
he was infinitely more valuable...</i>

464
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,555
<i>...raising money for the war effort.
The Liberty Loan adventure proved that.</i>

465
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,632
<i>But this was the first
mild controversy...</i>

466
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,360
<i>...of a life that would eventually
be plagued...</i>

467
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,592
<i>...occasionally dominated by them.</i>

468
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,429
<i>Later that year, he made this short,
promoting another Liberty Loan drive.</i>

469
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,995
<i>Syd Chaplin played the hapless Kaiser.</i>

470
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,753
<i>His most lasting wartime work was
Shoulder Arms. The Tramp in uniform.</i>

471
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,911
<i>He'd always been a brave little guy...</i>

472
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,675
<i>...but he'd never been tested on
such a huge and tragic field.</i>

473
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,799
<i>The spirit was willing,
maybe a little too much so.</i>

474
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,317
<i>Chaplin began production
of Shoulder Arms...</i>

475
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,914
...while the First World War
was being fought.

476
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,358
And many in the Hollywood community
were persuading him not to do it.

477
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,548
<i>But Chaplin went on with it,
trusting his own artistic instincts.</i>

478
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,154
But he had doubts.
He was unsure of the result.

479
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,232
<i>But when the film was
released, it was a huge hit.</i>

480
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,235
It was one of the most popular films
of the entire First World War period.

481
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,872
<i>The picture was released just
weeks before the armistice...</i>

482
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,156
<i>...so it didn't do much for morale.</i>

483
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,398
<i>But the movie proved especially
popular with returning doughboys.</i>

484
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,757
<i>They thought it caught, humorously,
something of the horror...</i>

485
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,315
<i>...and absurdity of trench warfare.</i>

486
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,998
<i>Capturing a large enemy group, the
Tramp becomes an unlikely hero.</i>

487
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,118
<i>But his treatment of the aristocratic
officer aligns him...</i>

488
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,840
<i>...with the common people
of both sides.</i>

489
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,352
<i>Not that the Tramp was allowed
to capitalize on his heroism.</i>

490
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,715
<i>That would have been out of character.</i>

491
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,429
<i>But he was allowed time for a little
cross-cultural wooing with Edna.</i>

492
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,039
<i>In real life, their romance
was coming to an end.</i>

493
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,476
<i>Though, typically, Edna was
a good sport about it.</i>

494
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,877
<i>He loved young girls. The younger
the better, and he really did.</i>

495
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,436
He only saw pureness and innocence
and youth and beauty.

496
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,919
He was a romantic.

497
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,510
<i>In principal, it might have been okay
to marry these girls of 16 or 17.</i>

498
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,240
The big problem was this:
That they looked great...

499
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,029
<i>...but having got them home,
they were not very rewarding partners.</i>

500
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,079
<i>Chaplin met Mildred Harris, a young
actress, then 16 years old...</i>

501
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,196
<i>...while working on Shoulder Arms.</i>

502
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,952
<i>Seen here in Cecil B. DeMille's...</i>

503
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,470
<i>...Fool's Paradise,
she convinced him, falsely...</i>

504
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,952
<i>...that she was pregnant. And he married
her three days after his film's release.</i>

505
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,839
<i>They were never happy together,
and a portion of the public...</i>

506
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,549
<i>...was not happy thinking of Chaplin
with a child bride.</i>

507
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,190
<i>In the summer of 1919, however,
she delivered a baby...</i>

508
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,635
<i>...who died three days later.</i>

509
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,033
<i>Chaplin's personal anguish was reflected
in his blocked creative life at the time.</i>

510
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,795
It's remarkable that Chaplin always
made what he wanted...

511
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,229
...and put his own money behind it...

512
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,952
...and would do it and do it and
do it until he got it right.

513
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,671
<i>I mean, he was Kubrick before Kubrick,
and Kubrick didn't use his own money.</i>

514
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,630
That megalomaniac sense of
"I've got a vision.

515
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,475
<i>Although, maybe I'm not seeing it yet,
but I'll see it when it's there.</i>

516
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,438
I'll know it when I see it.
And let's shoot for a year. "

517
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,037
Which really is not an exaggeration
in some cases. "Until we get it. "

518
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,997
That's crazy.

519
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,477
<i>Perhaps justifiable craziness in this case.</i>

520
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,916
<i>Starting, stopping and starting again
on major productions...</i>

521
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,470
<i>...Chaplin cobbled together this film,
A Day's Pleasure...</i>

522
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,633
<i>...from old footage and some new
material, trying to satisfy First National...</i>

523
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,509
<i>...which was desperately pressing him
for releasable product.</i>

524
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,511
I've never been clear about who chose
when to use a title card.

525
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,831
And Chaplin uses them as brilliantly
as anybody in some movies...

526
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,549
...and then other movies- There's one
where the family is driving a Model T...

527
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,398
...and they're resurfacing the road.

528
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,592
<i>And quite clearly, a dump truck dumps
a lot of tar onto the road...</i>

529
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,878
<i>...but somebody decided they had to put
a title that said, "Tar. " So one word:</i>

530
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,000
Then you come back and see
people with their feet stuck.

531
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,878
The old "shoes nailed to
the stage" gag...

532
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,555
...which Chaplin uses great because
his feet are stuck in the tar.

533
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,758
<i>His major preoccupation was The Kid.</i>

534
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,435
<i>He'd seen the remarkable Jackie
Coogan in vaudeville, signed him...</i>

535
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,831
<i>...then appeared with him before this
assemblage of visiting exhibitors...</i>

536
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,673
<i>...promoting his unfinished dream.</i>

537
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,273
Laughter is very unpredictable.
You cannot sit down and write out:

538
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,954
<i>"We will do this, this, this
and this. That is the gag. "</i>

539
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,315
And then do it and hope
it will be funny.

540
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,631
It's quite true that weeks and
sometimes months would go by...

541
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,713
<i>...when he didn't have the inspiration,
and everybody sat around the studio...</i>

542
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,071
<i>...and he would or wouldn't come in,
but nothing would happen.</i>

543
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,596
<i>That happened very badly before
he started on The Kid, for instance.</i>

544
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,913
<i>Mildred Harris sued Chaplin
for divorce in 1920.</i>

545
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,719
<i>Her attorneys threatened
to attach his negative.</i>

546
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,395
<i>Chaplin fled to Salt Lake City
to finish editing The Kid.</i>

547
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,230
<i>He ate women up, and they came and
they went in extraordinary numbers.</i>

548
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,313
<i>If you're leading a life like that, you're
gonna have trouble sooner or later.</i>

549
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,711
You're gonna get involved with women
who are too young...

550
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,396
...women who've got dangerous
mothers or dangerous lawyers.

551
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,916
<i>It was a year and a half before he
finally turned the negative of The Kid...</i>

552
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,991
<i>...over to his distributors.</i>

553
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,151
<i>It was worth the wait.</i>

554
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,118
<i>A masterpiece and a huge
step forward for Chaplin.</i>

555
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,116
<i>Early in the film, Chaplin keeps trying
to abandon the abandoned baby.</i>

556
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,511
<i>He injected within something,
such as The Kid...</i>

557
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,150
<i>...a truth, a poignancy,
which was just magical.</i>

558
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,677
He's been landed with this baby.
He doesn't know what to do with it.

559
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,878
There's one brutal moment when
he's sitting on the pavement...

560
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:00,313
<i>...holding this baby, and there's a drain
there. He just lifts up the drain cover.</i>

561
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,553
<i>Oh, why did he do that? Is he going
to drop the baby down the drain?</i>

562
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,194
They're passing thoughts
that flit through his head...

563
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,749
...but he gets them over to the audience.

564
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,476
It was a very daring film in many ways.
The idea of mixing slapstick comedy...

565
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,155
...with dramatic scenes had not been
done. And many intelligent people...

566
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,870
...told Chaplin it could not be done...

567
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,918
...that one of the story elements
was bound to fail.

568
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,278
And the performance that
he created with Jackie...

569
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,195
...a miraculous piece of cinema
acting and relationship.

570
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,874
Jackie Coogan was his greatest costar.
The reason being...

571
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,237
...that Coogan was so malleable.
I mean he was the perfect Chaplin actor.

572
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,230
He could just repeat and do exactly
what Chaplin would show him to do.

573
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,197
<i>Including stealing quarters
from the gas meter.</i>

574
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,319
<i>The Kid was Chaplin's most directly
autobiographical film.</i>

575
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,950
<i>He had been a waif on London's streets.
He had yearned for a father.</i>

576
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,669
<i>His own had abandoned him.
He had been, until she went mad...</i>

577
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,559
<i>...lovingly tended by his
impoverished mother.</i>

578
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,793
<i>He had known all the emotions
The Kid played upon.</i>

579
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,593
<i>In the autobiography, he talks about that
he was not very healthy as a little boy.</i>

580
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,718
<i>And his mother would sit at the window
when he was in bed, sick...</i>

581
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,509
...and she would just describe everything
that went on outside and imitate it...

582
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,717
<i>...and say, "And now there's this man. "
And she would imitate the man.</i>

583
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,235
<i>"And there's this little boy,
and there's this woman. "</i>

584
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,233
And she would tell stories about
what was going on outside.

585
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,476
He knew how every part
should be played.

586
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,114
<i>More than anything, he'd have
liked to play every part.</i>

587
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,039
<i>Every boy, every girl, every old man,
everything in the film.</i>

588
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,149
<i>Of course, he couldn't. He had
to use, unwillingly use, other actors.</i>

589
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,152
What he really wanted to do
was to tell them...

590
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,550
...and show them exactly how
he would do it.

591
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,678
He wanted them to be him
playing the part.

592
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,913
This was absolutely fine when you had
a brilliant little mimic like Jackie Coogan.

593
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:48,438
Charlie just did something and Jackie
could do the exact imitation of it.

594
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,349
<i>By a strange chance, I saw
The Kid last night...</i>

595
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,308
...and I am once again convinced
it is his best work.

596
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,559
That intensity when there's the threat
that the Kid is going to be...

597
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,958
<i>...taken to an institution, I think that
has to come out of his own childhood...</i>

598
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,715
<i>...his own feelings, his own memories
of being taken off...</i>

599
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,000
...separated from his mother and his
brother and incarcerated in an institution.

600
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,198
<i>And I think that that is what gives
The Kid its peculiar intensity.</i>

601
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,798
The scene where he becomes a madman
in his effort to rescue the child.

602
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,959
Is there a more tragic moment in pictures
than the Kid begging to go with him?

603
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,709
It's one of the greatest things
I have ever seen...

604
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,553
...that kid pleading to be taken to him.

605
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,069
<i>In The Kid, the big emotions
are in the boy.</i>

606
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,073
The little boy that's being taken
away from where he should be...

607
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,596
<i>...from love and affection,
by the state, to do good...</i>

608
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,955
...to do good because this
will be better for him.

609
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,955
<i>In The Kid, they're taking this little
kid to a horrible orphanage.</i>

610
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,995
He was taken away from his mother...

611
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,869
...and put in the Lambeth Workhouse
at the age of 7.

612
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,429
He was taken away from his mother.
It's so terrible.

613
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,068
<i>He and Sydney, and they were
in the workhouse.</i>

614
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,556
<i>He knows what it is, that wrenching,
being pulled away. Why?</i>

615
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,912
<i>Because the mother was in no fit mental
state, and the father had disappeared.</i>

616
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,672
And they were destitute.

617
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,116
<i>Charles Chaplin Sr. had been a
headliner, until he succumbed to drink.</i>

618
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,670
<i>All his life, his son abhorred alcohol.</i>

619
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,638
<i>When they really hit rock bottom,
then the only recourse...</i>

620
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,917
<i>...was to go to the workhouse,
which was the place for the destitute...</i>

621
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,399
...of this parish.

622
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,835
Not much of it remains.

623
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,272
<i>And what there is of it is blackened over
by a hundred years of London soot.</i>

624
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,914
<i>After becoming a star, Chaplin supported
his mother in a London asylum...</i>

625
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,275
<i>...and eventually brought her to America.</i>

626
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,152
<i>But he largely avoided her.</i>

627
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,993
<i>Both his parents had lost control
of their lives...</i>

628
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,549
<i>...to the irrational forces
he deeply feared.</i>

629
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,278
<i>Meantime, while still fulfilling his
First National contract, Chaplin...</i>

630
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,115
<i>...with D. W. Griffith, Mary Pickford
and Douglas Fairbanks...</i>

631
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,396
<i>...created United Artists.</i>

632
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,552
<i>They would now have full
ownership of their films.</i>

633
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,598
<i>The plan had been hatched
on the Liberty Loan Tour.</i>

634
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,913
<i>Ever the performer, Chaplin
donned costume and makeup...</i>

635
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,036
<i>...for the newsreel cameramen.</i>

636
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,714
<i>Despite these affectionate poses,
Chaplin and Pickford...</i>

637
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,519
<i>...were often at odds within
the company.</i>

638
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,798
<i>But her husband, famously athletic Doug
Fairbanks, was Chaplin's closest...</i>

639
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,032
<i>...and, obviously, most supportive friend.</i>

640
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,395
<i>Doug and Mary saw Chaplin off
for London in 1921.</i>

641
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,714
<i>It was his first trip home since leaving
on the Karno American Tour in 1912.</i>

642
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,713
<i>As he set sail, Chaplin had no idea...</i>

643
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,236
<i>...of what was awaiting him
in his native country.</i>

644
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,279
<i>As the SS Olympic sailed eastward,
a relaxed Chaplin supervised...</i>

645
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,069
<i>...a shipboard contest aimed
at discovering his best imitator.</i>

646
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,279
<i>Hundreds of such contests were going
on all over America at the time.</i>

647
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,433
<i>One of their winners was a
6- year-old Milton Berle.</i>

648
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,479
<i>The Olympic docked at Southampton
on September 9th.</i>

649
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,996
<i>The mobs greeting him were
without precedent.</i>

650
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,790
<i>It was a repeat of the Liberty Loan Tour,
but now raised to flash point.</i>

651
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,755
<i>Until these mobs emerged to meet
Chaplin, no one had quite imagined...</i>

652
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,072
<i>...how movie stardom had upped
the stakes in the celebrity game.</i>

653
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,518
So how did that affect him? I think he
always fought to keep his integrity...

654
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,832
<i>...and part of his fighting things, too,
was fighting himself, fighting to keep-</i>

655
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,953
To keep his humanity in the face
of this enormous fame he had.

656
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,391
<i>Keeping your humanity.
It's celebrity's most basic issue.</i>

657
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,229
<i>For the rest of his life, even when
he was an old man in exile...</i>

658
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,233
<i>...Chaplin would have to contend
with mass adoration...</i>

659
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,592
<i>...whenever he went out in public.
It does something to a man.</i>

660
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,469
<i>Chaplin sneaked away from his hotel
to visit the scenes of his childhood...</i>

661
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,148
<i>...as he always would whenever
he returned to London.</i>

662
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,279
<i>A friend, the writer Thomas Burke,
once said of Chaplin that:</i>

663
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,796
<i>"He needed London
as an actor needs a script. "</i>

664
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,190
<i>This pub had once been owned
by his uncle.</i>

665
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,194
<i>It was here that he observed an aged
retainer, Rummy Banks, a horse-holder...</i>

666
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,393
<i>...doing the toes-out walk that Chaplin
would make the most famous aspect...</i>

667
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,039
<i>...of his Tramp character.</i>

668
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,354
<i>He returned, too, to the humble flats
he'd once shared...</i>

669
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,670
<i>...with his mother and brother.</i>

670
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,156
<i>This was once a pickle factory...</i>

671
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,630
<i>...the stench of which he never
got out of his nostrils.</i>

672
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,395
<i>The Chaplins lived hard by it
in this little street.</i>

673
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,399
<i>On this trip, Chaplin was also
tumultuously welcomed...</i>

674
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,755
<i>...in Paris and Berlin,
where he experienced...</i>

675
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,229
<i>...something of their decadent,
aristocratic life.</i>

676
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,153
<i>He returned to America determined
to put it on-screen.</i>

677
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,874
<i>Chaplin also wanted to give
Edna a great role...</i>

678
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,237
<i>...one that would help her build a
career independent of him.</i>

679
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,795
<i>When A Woman of Paris came out,
it had the biggest critical reception...</i>

680
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,316
...practically of any silent film.
The critics said it was absolutely great.

681
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,232
The audience just stayed away.

682
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,353
<i>It was Chaplin's first failure, and this
was because he wasn't in it.</i>

683
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,433
It was a terrible miscalculation to have
a Chaplin film without Chaplin.

684
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,068
I think there are probably
two reasons for this.

685
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,109
One was certainly that he was
determined to try to help Edna...

686
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,158
...to give her a new career
as a dramatic actress.

687
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,397
<i>And, obviously, she was going to look
much better if he held back...</i>

688
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,754
...and was not there to-

689
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,152
<i>If Charlie Chaplin was in the film, nobody
would see anybody but Charlie Chaplin.</i>

690
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,756
<i>I think it was also just he wanted
to try himself, to see if he could...</i>

691
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,833
...make a dramatic film and not be
a part of it in performance.

692
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,072
He does this tiny little piece.
He's unbilled...

693
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,151
...and he's a porter.
He carries a trunk.

694
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,596
There are actually reviews from the time
where people hadn't known...

695
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,435
<i>...it was Chaplin, but they picked out
this little comic moment.</i>

696
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,915
Probably the film would have
done immensely better...

697
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,514
...if Chaplin had taken his name off it.

698
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,998
You do feel it when certain aspects
are just rejected and say:

699
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,914
"You are only meant to do
this sort of thing. That's it. "

700
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,197
"We'll only see your film
if you're in it.

701
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,914
We don't care how beautifully
you composed the frame.

702
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,719
<i>We don't care about
the sumptuousness of the décor. "</i>

703
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,236
<i>It's detail, and then to go from
that detail out.</i>

704
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,229
<i>And that is what you see in A Woman of
Paris is the detail. And they always say:</i>

705
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,829
<i>"It's in the details. "
That's a cliché, but it's true.</i>

706
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,390
The kitchen scene at the beginning
has to do with the smell of the game.

707
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,755
Why is this elaborate thing going on?

708
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,595
But you get a sense of how
the people lived because of that.

709
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,950
<i>Look at her bedroom, alone, or the party
scenes or the woman being unraveled.</i>

710
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,918
<i>You know, it really is extraordinary.
He cuts to the guy.</i>

711
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,470
The cloth is being unraveled from
the left of the frame to the right.

712
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,792
<i>The sense of decadence, the sense of
eroticism in the film is very strong.</i>

713
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,030
It's purely modern. It really is modern.

714
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,915
<i>It's advanced for its time. And the thing
about it is, it doesn't have the words.</i>

715
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,150
They didn't have the technology
for the words.

716
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,471
But they're like really up there.
They're behaving.

717
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,913
Look at the moment.
I get chills when I think of it.

718
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,516
It's a beautiful scene when
the painter comes in to the party.

719
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,275
<i>Balloons are flying around,
and girls are dancing.</i>

720
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,716
<i>And Adolphe Menjou invites him in,
and his elegance, just his form-</i>

721
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,953
<i>Has him sit down, and he lights
the cigarette for the artist.</i>

722
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,079
<i>Just watch that again in terms of acting.
Now, that's everything, the subtlety.</i>

723
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,471
<i>Once you concentrate on a moment
like that, it's quite something.</i>

724
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,952
And it's very modern. It's very
natural. It isn't overdone.

725
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,758
<i>This is the film's basic triangle:</i>

726
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,196
<i>Jean, the provincial painter
who abandoned Marie...</i>

727
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,069
<i>...Pierre, the Paris decadent
who is now keeping her.</i>

728
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,435
<i>Another scene in that film, which
is fascinating, is when the artist...</i>

729
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,996
...is telling his mother it was just
a moment of weakness.

730
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,109
<i>And she comes in, and she
hears them say that.</i>

731
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,598
<i>It's a shot on her back, and you can see
the reaction it has on her, her body.</i>

732
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,275
She doesn't move. The camera doesn't
cut to a tighter shot of her or anything.

733
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,638
<i>But you feel all of that, and it holds
for a very long time before she turns.</i>

734
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,757
Another director would not have done
it that way. There's no doubt.

735
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,876
And it's very powerful.

736
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,548
<i>Then, of course, he's telling
the story with pictures.</i>

737
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,632
You have that moment in the picture...

738
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,115
...where the artist is standing
under the lamppost.

739
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,556
<i>Their love has been rekindled,
but the painter is weak-willed...</i>

740
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,359
<i>...dominated by a disapproving mother.</i>

741
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,834
<i>And there's a slow fade-out on him,
and you know what's going to begin.</i>

742
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,991
It's going to take it now to a tragic turn.

743
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,072
<i>He doesn't stop there, though.
It's a slow fade-out on his face...</i>

744
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,597
...and he's just left glowing a little bit.
And then it cuts to a series of shots...

745
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,390
<i>...that are irises. Edna in bed,
that's an iris. The mother.</i>

746
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,393
And you just know that now
everything's in place...

747
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,233
...and we're ready to go because
the final scene is coming.

748
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,870
There's a calmness about it
that is terrifying...

749
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,349
...because you know it's
going to go badly.

750
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,397
And it's all very objective.

751
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,279
Putting everybody in place until
you have that great moment...

752
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,557
<i>...where the mother takes
the gun, and she's like...</i>

753
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,157
...something out of mythology
in this black veil...

754
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,158
...and the dress and the flowing
in the wind.

755
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,551
<i>Jean has killed himself.
His mother wants to avenge him.</i>

756
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,508
<i>But discovering Marie weeping
over him makes her relent.</i>

757
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,592
<i>First you think she's going
to shoot her, and she doesn't.</i>

758
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,792
<i>There's no close-up,
but it's very moving.</i>

759
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,357
<i>A Woman of Paris on a big screen must
have been powerful, very powerful.</i>

760
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,231
<i>The film's great concluding irony.</i>

761
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,312
<i>Pierre is untouched by the tragedy,
perhaps unknowing of it.</i>

762
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,432
<i>She and Jean's mother devote
themselves to an orphanage.</i>

763
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,036
<i>She and Pierre pass
one another unseeing.</i>

764
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:49,350
<i>Another of Chaplin's open-road endings,
but without the cheerful Tramp.</i>

765
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,795
<i>Since 1915, the public had been
encouraged toward total adoration...</i>

766
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,988
<i>...of Chaplin's image. You could
see him in animated cartoons.</i>

767
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,958
<i>Or in the comic strips.</i>

768
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,717
<i>Or you could buy a Chaplin toy or game.</i>

769
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,593
<i>The Tramp was ubiquitous
and inescapable.</i>

770
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,438
<i>Everywhere you turned, there he was:</i>

771
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,398
<i>The sweet, slightly befuddled
little fellow.</i>

772
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,473
<i>It was the first great multimedia
merchandising barrage.</i>

773
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,039
<i>Chaplin, in those days, loved his fame
in quite an uncomplicated way.</i>

774
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,788
<i>Everyone who was anyone visited
Chaplin at his studio...</i>

775
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,428
<i>...when they visited Los Angeles.</i>

776
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,076
<i>He was always on.
The camera was always present.</i>

777
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,071
<i>If he loved playing the Tramp...</i>

778
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,119
<i>...he loved at least as much his role
as a world-class celebrity.</i>

779
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:56,276
<i>Thomas Burke again, "He lives only
in a role, and he is lost without it. "</i>

780
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,157
<i>But he was also the great god Pan,
a famous or notorious womanizer.</i>

781
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,916
<i>I think falling in love for Chaplin
probably was a great, great moment.</i>

782
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,519
<i>There are moments in his films where he
sees the girl, and he sort of swoons.</i>

783
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,673
<i>I think he did it in real life,
which is wonderful and romantic...</i>

784
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,673
<i>...and attractive and pretty,
except that he probably does it...</i>

785
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,994
<i>...three or four times a day,
and that requires an endless supply.</i>

786
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,951
<i>In his Show People cameo
for King Vidor, the joke is...</i>

787
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,956
<i>...the world's most famous man
is unrecognized in real life.</i>

788
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,352
<i>The unimpressed girl is Marion Davies,
William Randolph Hearst's mistress...</i>

789
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,353
<i>...and one of Chaplin's lovers as well.</i>

790
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,678
<i>She swooned.
They all swooned.</i>

791
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,590
<i>Often to Chaplin's ultimate sorrow.</i>

792
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,354
<i>He had met Lita Grey when she was 12.</i>

793
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,671
<i>She'd played an angel, of sorts,
for him in The Kid.</i>

794
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:14,675
<i>She reappeared in his life, age 15,
when he was casting The Gold Rush.</i>

795
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,913
<i>The Kid's dream sequence
is uncannily symbolic.</i>

796
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,511
<i>She presented herself at the studio,
and Chaplin made a screen test of her...</i>

797
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,792
<i>...and then she was hired as
the leading lady in The Gold Rush.</i>

798
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,633
Lita had hero-worship for Chaplin...

799
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,554
...and Chaplin had an interest
in young women.

800
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,515
He liked to see the young girl awaken.

801
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,240
<i>As Lita would say,
"He had a fetish for virgins. "</i>

802
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,596
<i>They married in November, 1924.
She was pregnant with their first child...</i>

803
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,316
<i>...when Chaplin took his company
on location to Truckee, California.</i>

804
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,836
<i>By then, he knew the pregnant
Lita would have to be replaced.</i>

805
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,675
<i>Their baby was born in May, 1925.</i>

806
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,075
Chaplin knew what he has
to show the audience.

807
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,750
When he's making films in the
environment which is known to us...

808
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,151
<i>...from everyday life, you know,
he doesn't need to show you much.</i>

809
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:13,077
<i>But then in The Gold Rush, you know,
who ever traveled to Alaska...</i>

810
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,913
...and the Klondike and saw all this
and like that?

811
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,594
<i>So he knew, "I have to show it. "</i>

812
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,678
<i>In Truckee, Chaplin made the most
spectacular sequence of his career.</i>

813
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,308
<i>It involved 600 extras.</i>

814
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,438
<i>Curiously, the man famous
for his obsessive retakes...</i>

815
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,751
<i>...did the entire piece in a single day.</i>

816
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,239
<i>But Truckee was a brutal and
uncontrollable location.</i>

817
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,079
<i>Chaplin would have to match his location
footage to studio-made footage.</i>

818
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,710
<i>Mostly, The Gold Rush would be adored
by critics and public.</i>

819
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,476
<i>But some reviewers struck a note that
would resound more loudly in the future.</i>

820
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,473
<i>They said that Chaplin
was old-fashioned...</i>

821
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,269
<i>...not keeping up with
advances in film technique.</i>

822
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,749
<i>But the Tramp was unchanged,
ever the optimist...</i>

823
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,150
<i>...ever the seeker after good fortune...</i>

824
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,834
<i>...and ever oblivious, at least at first...</i>

825
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,873
<i>...to whatever dangers
might be stalking him.</i>

826
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,591
<i>It was the same with Chaplin,
a devoted cinematic purist.</i>

827
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,835
<i>That's how you know he's a legend
already by The Gold Rush...</i>

828
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,468
<i>...because, of course,
the Little Tramp can be...</i>

829
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,473
...on the side of an
icy mountain with no coat.

830
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,640
<i>The hope of shooting
The Gold Rush on location...</i>

831
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,189
<i>...was buried in the snows of Truckee.</i>

832
00:57:45,305 --> 00:57:51,333
