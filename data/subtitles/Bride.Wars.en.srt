1
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,398
Marriage Affairs.
Do not touch

2
00:01:55,016 --> 00:02:00,642
It all started 20 years ago,
in the Plaza hotel in the month of June

3
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:04,140
Two mothers were with
their daughters, Liv and Emma

4
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:06,590
here for a cup of tea

5
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:10,738
That afternoon was
a wedding instead

6
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:16,390
There was something blue, something borrowed
and something completely magical.

7
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:22,671
And two little girls from New Jersey
had a new dream

8
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:27,803
Once they discover that a
person on their side would ...

9
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:31,423
whatever happened.
And when the time comes ...

10
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:35,572
they will also get married in the Plaza

11
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,502
Thank you

12
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:43,262
And yes, Your Honor,
this neglected man

13
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:47,166
I knew my marriage is the most beautiful
day of my life

14
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,299
Now I want a creature until we have
six children and a house

15
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,523
They allow pets in the Plaza?

16
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:03,322
It is not that we marry
until we are sixteen, at least six times

17
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:07,646
- Can I be the bride?
- Emma, you know I always play the bride

18
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:16,295
- Not too shabbily,
- Cocktails, cigars, operation with white apron

19
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,043
- dancers and video recordings
- Great DJ

20
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:21,093
So we give them
that ? it is beautiful

21
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:24,683
- But ...
- Is this the work of Marion St. Claire?

22
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:27,724
Marion has one vision

23
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:33,399
- If my marriage was ...
- Say it

24
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,969
- It is not June
- And not the Plaza

25
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,768
- It is the elephant in the room
- Yes

26
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:42,566
- And here are you
- Check it out

27
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,337
A duck made of ice, is not
great? You know what else is great?

28
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:49,269
We asked to go home
and look to your TiVo

29
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:51,581
Am I so predictable?

30
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:55,142
Another dance, then give
I give you my piece of cake

31
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:58,170
- If you let me go.
- Very funny.

32
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,390
- Come on.
- You know I always go.

33
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:05,712
Hello girls

34
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:07,753
Are you ready for this
bridal bouquet to catch?

35
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,619
- I gotta go.
- I'm so glad you all ...

36
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,794
- On the other hand, I always won.
- I know, we take it so seriously.

37
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,853
My work, my friends around

38
00:04:16,854 --> 00:04:18,390
My friends from school

39
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:22,346
My heavens, Emma Allen,
is that the same dress ...

40
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:26,953
you contributed to the gamma delta benefit
presentation one trillion years ago?

41
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,276
- Yes
- What does it matter?

42
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:31,344
Because it is a classic piece,
which you've worked hard.

43
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:35,085
Look, this is love and faith.

44
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:38,146
Friends for coming together, I like that

45
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:39,570
Keep it up

46
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,444
- Anyway, are you ready?
- Yes!

47
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:46,686
Remember just feel it and catch it.

48
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:49,268
One ...

49
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:51,300
Two ...

50
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:52,640
Three.

51
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,252
I would have seen the signs,
as I had been.

52
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:59,422
It was all there.
Look at Emma's eyes.

53
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:05,119
As a hunter and Liv her hand,
how does it feel around your throat?

54
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:10,052
Not that they can imagine
that they are hurting right now.

55
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:11,330
Why should they?

56
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:16,524
- 20 years are inseparable .
- Okay, just slow down.

57
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,660
- I walk better with iPods .
- You can not run with iPods ...

58
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,969
because iPods are for people who
not have their own thoughts.

59
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,290
I literally walk circles around you

60
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:28,879
The only thing I can think about
is how I am a disaster

61
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,880
- Did you like this kind of conversation, I am hurt .
- I gotta go.

62
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:34,744
- Bye, I love you .
- Tell me how the meeting went

63
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:35,876
The energy increase

64
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:41,994
- Hey, you have the changes been?
- I read it in the taxi

65
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:45,021
It seems that the whole town is mad at Liv

66
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:48,043
A bold approach to dezwakheden use of ...

67
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:49,336
the affairs of our clients

68
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:53,872
I think we legally strong,
especially when we have a verdict sheets

69
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:57,252
Thanks, Liv.
Our best partner

70
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:00,510
Maybe your approach to brutal?

71
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:04,575
If we strike,
they will not bite soon

72
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:09,182
You know me not,
but I know you

73
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:12,265
You just know
how hard you want to win

74
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:14,520
Because if we do not

75
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,994
You're right, she is perfect

76
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:21,834
- Miss Allen.
- Robert, how are you?

77
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:27,480
- I think Miss Delgado you are looking for.
- Is that so? Was she in the neighborhood?

78
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,337
She is in the room

79
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:37,415
- There you are, Emma.
- My God, hello.

80
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:41,487
Is not it beautiful?
I feel so good in this body.

81
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:45,020
- No, I'm already too late.
- No, no, you gotta help me.

82
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:49,666
Remember the debate team.
I can not go to finals.

83
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,458
Children who talk about their problems

84
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:59,480
- You should be in my place.
- I do buscontrole late already and ...

85
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:02,094
cheerleaders and nablijvers.

86
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,114
You're the debate Adviser
and I do not think I ...

87
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,185
I do so much, I wish
the minimum I could do.

88
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:14,118
- I admire you so.
- Thanks

89
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,526
Anyway,
this is how we do

90
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:19,047
I appreciate the debate team and ...

91
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:22,743
You take all my study guidance on
on Tuesday, for the rest of the year

92
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:24,133
- You know that ...
- No

93
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:27,201
Well then, you owe me 't chalk

94
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:28,829
From the road, children!

95
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:32,065
You know why they do.
You are the best teacher there ...

96
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:36,744
therefore gives you a lot of work.
Your school is a jungle.

97
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:39,101
I do not know, she's quite sad.

98
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:42,327
She has been divorced three times.

99
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:45,607
It is far for us,
where our divorce?

100
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:49,439
I must first get married.
I hate Daniel.

101
00:07:52,754 --> 00:07:55,134
No, Kevin, I have an emergency.

102
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:59,308
- What is your emergency?
- Code Name 'I talk to you later. "

103
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:02,137
- So, I understand what you do with me.
- Watch, Sun.

104
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:04,302
- They fit perfectly with you.
- Is not it too tight?

105
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:09,132
No, not at all. But this ...
Yellow is not your color.

106
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:11,945
Really.
But try this

107
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,737
Because you know what,
love it.

108
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:16,166
It was not me.

109
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:23,399
Of course not, because it is
my size and it is new

110
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,713
This is the subject of
I see you last week said

111
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,548
- Liv, I can not ...
- Bought in the sale.

112
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:32,101
- I have actually removed money.
- It is too much.

113
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:34,999
Thank me, Emma.

114
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,613
Thanks, it's beautiful.
I like it.

115
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:40,987
Well, and now this. Emma her stuff.
Let's disposal.

116
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,988
You look like hundred years ago.

117
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,279
- Daniel's pull, right?
- Yes, love it.

118
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:58,389
- A square box.
- You become engaged.

119
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,804
We are engaged!

120
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,146
- My heavens, Emma.
- No, stop it.

121
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,778
No, stop.

122
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:17,080
Excuse me.

123
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:19,842
But you should see your face,
if you ring for the first time see.

124
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:21,651
Good thought.

125
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:25,000
You always think of others.
This is not even to me.

126
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:27,812
Sometimes, but ...

127
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:32,215
I am very happy for you.

128
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:35,404
Promise me that no one tells you,
before he makes his proposal.

129
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:39,208
I would never do.
I am not crazy.

130
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:45,295
Engaged!

131
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,407
- We get four Tequila Shots?
- No.

132
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:52,526
No, not me.

133
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:53,727
I have enough.

134
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:56,485
Acapulco 2006, Emma and Fletcher,
great.

135
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,052
We 're not
talk about that weekend?

136
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:02,308
That is so romantic,
confused and very thirsty.

137
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:06,236
- Please.
- Well, stop, please.

138
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:10,462
- A dean at Liv.
- Congratulations, friend.

139
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:12,633
And sympathy for Emma
Liv's bridesmaid.

140
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:15,763
They will certainly the best 'nightmare
bride' who ever lived

141
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:19,644
- It is my burden and ...
- I give you a favor back.

142
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,987
- Why are you here?
- I married.

143
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:25,973
- You are kidding?
- Yes.

144
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:29,115
My sister is married.
Where is the groom?

145
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:33,133
- He is not here.
- He has not really asked.

146
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,718
A dean at Daniel.

147
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:41,099
That late in his own world, but in
Livs world did not offer.

148
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:42,462
Let God bless him.

149
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:44,674
That he is in life
my sister is living ...

150
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,421
in any world.

151
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:47,489
Yes, I love you.

152
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:52,210
- He has a lot of luck.
- Yes, the biggest day of your life.

153
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,336
- Should I go?
- I do it.

154
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,773
I mean they could not see
how I graduated.

155
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:27,717
Law, or the first story
in the journal read.

156
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:31,990
And I can not
with them.

157
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:36,671
I wish your parents
also allowed to them

158
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:40,095
Whatever, it's good

159
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:41,553
I'm fine.

160
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:45,186
You're only human,
you should not have for each other ...

161
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:47,406
every minute of the day.

162
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:50,720
Former fat girls, just like me.

163
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,976
Fortunately we survived.

164
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:56,217
You were not fat.

165
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:58,970
Yes, you survived.

166
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:01,916
- Thank you, Em.
- Sure, Liv.

167
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:05,055
- You will be a good bridesmaid.
- Yeah, right.

168
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,658
- But I am first.
- First?

169
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:10,709
You may have first
get a proposal?

170
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,448
- You really have an eye for detail.
- Really? I know.

171
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:21,575
Honey, I think the fortune cookies not.

172
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:24,492
Wait, I have them here.

173
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,333
Good.

174
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:29,040
pleaze

175
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,754
I take it out. This guy must really go.
Sorry, I know how much he may.

176
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:36,976
- He is very vague.
- This is not real.

177
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:39,747
Vague. say you
someone you can not.

178
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:42,848
You are vague.
That was me.

179
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,369
- Please?
- You really choose?

180
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,319
- Yes, he was on my side.
- That is not very ...

181
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,540
- Yours is better than mine, which I take.
- I do not think so.

182
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,728
Are you ready?
A ...

183
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:54,644
- Two ...
- Three.

184
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:06,220
What is this?

185
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:09,286
I have long thought, how I
this was done.

186
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:13,068
And I wanted to do here,
this is our home.

187
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:17,593
And when I'm 99 years, and we
doing the same here at home.

188
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,621
Television, chinese food ...
Then that is good enough.

189
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:30,475
- Emma Allen, will you marry me?
- Yes.

190
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:38,559
It did not happen, but I
not worried because Daniel ...

191
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,858
I'm engaged.
Fletcher made his proposal ...

192
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:44,392
about two minutes ago.

193
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,321
- I'm engaged.
- Color?

194
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:49,098
- Colorless.
- Sliced?

195
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:50,216
- Brilliant.
- Brightness?

196
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:52,575
- Slightly shiny.
- Carat?

197
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:55,931
Almost or just under ...
More than he could pay.

198
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:03,965
Engaged?
Liv is engaged.

199
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:08,022
Both engaged ...
This is ...

200
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:09,874
I gotta go.

201
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,868
What do you mean, that Emma is engaged?

202
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,653
No, why would not I be happy?

203
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:21,867
That is great.

204
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:23,515
No, you should not come.
I'm okay, I do not eat.

205
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:26,699
And I have the perfect wedding gift.

206
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:30,926
You have to live
by Emma and Fletcher.

207
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,893
You annoys me.

208
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:43,280
I can not believe it,
so weird that I got him.

209
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:46,509
- The glistening even in the rain.
- Dazzle.

210
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,567
I think I want  DJ Humple on my party
But is not that weird?

211
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:53,034
- No, you do.
- I'm not as for large groups.

212
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:56,090
- Well, it's your wedding.
- My mother can not organize the wedding.

213
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:58,816
She is too busy.
I got you, right?

214
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:02,339
- Yes, I'm so excited.
- You coming to meet her?

215
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,099
- Sorry, what? Who?
- Marion St. Claire.

216
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:09,254
Have you not heard?
I have an appointment on Friday.

217
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:12,331
You already made an appointment?
You're just yesterday engaged.

218
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:14,742
I know, but I am
already behind.

219
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:17,996
You must book early,
Plaza if you want.

220
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:20,740
The Plaza? Unbelievable.

221
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,665
What is wrong?
Why are you angry?

222
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:26,617
I'm not mad at you. I just said
why is there until about Daniel.

223
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:29,855
Heaven, I'm sorry.
I had not ...

224
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:32,991
- We do not need to talk.
- Do not worry about me.

225
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:35,446
Do not worry about Daniel,
we are so engaged.

226
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:41,028
- I'll call you later.
- What do you do? Let him do.

227
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:45,087
Excuse me.

228
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:55,364
- Honey, faith now agree with me.
- Good.

229
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,521
- Honey, faith now agree with me.
- Good.

230
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:04,463
- Will you not married?
- Can we talk later?

231
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,203
You changed mind,
I saw the Tiffany box in the closet.

232
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,250
Yeah, right

233
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:17,226
My heaven ...

234
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,208
It is not a ring?

235
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:23,958
If the chain is, usually I
suicide and I take you.

236
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:29,281
Can you tell me now,
it is something you want?

237
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:33,157
- Wil you marry?
- You know what I will say?

238
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:38,715
I've never been so unpleasant,
complex, dominant ...

239
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:44,680
beautiful, smart, sexy
woman in my life and ...

240
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:49,358
you only had to wait
this evening ...

241
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:54,746
Well, I'm in love with a woman,
who has no patience ...

242
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,572
Keep you a little while?
- Yes.

243
00:16:56,573 --> 00:17:00,029
What all is good,
as long as I my whole life ...

244
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,680
may seek to keep.

245
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,822
Wil you marry me?

246
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:11,572
You will make a proposal?
Really?

247
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:15,327
Honey, that is so unexpected.
- Shut up, yes or no?

248
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:18,199
Yes!

249
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,596
If I had not planned.
- Are you serious?

250
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,627
I love "make you hot
women to work 'day.

251
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:29,582
Complete.

252
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:37,213
And that brought these two brides
at my house that afternoon.

253
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:40,356
No, not now.
Forward.

254
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:42,059
I'm back in order.

255
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,491
I'm Marion St. Claire,
the most famous wedding planner in Manhattan.

256
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,277
Hi, we have an appointment for an hour.

257
00:17:57,278 --> 00:18:01,906
We both married and
each other bridesmaid.

258
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:05,088
You are kidding,
that is incredible.

259
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:11,364
Ms. St. Claire can you
now received.

260
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:17,173
I'm Emma Allen.
- What an honor!

261
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:20,530
Put yours.
- Roger.

262
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:31,671
A wedding marks the first day,
for the rest of your life.

263
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:36,951
You were dead, until now.
You realized that?

264
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:38,786
You are now dead.

265
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:42,208
I understand.
- For example, Angela ...

266
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,100
will guarantee death.

267
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:49,055
I read the letter that they
you wrote about.

268
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:52,397
Two wedding in the Plaza.

269
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:57,344
Is there not a small possibility?
- If you went somewhere else ...

270
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:01,726
no chance.
But you're here.

271
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:05,078
Call me Dreamcatcher, I reply.

272
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,458
Dreamcatcher.

273
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:13,351
I happened to have
three options in the Plaza ...

274
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:17,744
in June.
Two first Saturday.

275
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:22,953
And last Saturday,
the sixth and 27th.

276
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,623
My parents their wedding anniversary
the sixth, it must.

277
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,095
My heaven.
- Yes.

278
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:29,575
Then I take the 27th.
- Fantastic.

279
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:33,012
Wil you discuss with your bruidegommen?
- No.

280
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:38,214
Okay, sign here and put
the date here.

281
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:41,253
This feels very good.

282
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:46,413
We need to discuss themes.
- Very little text.

283
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:49,844
And trendy fusion.

284
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:51,948
I am impressed.
- Really?

285
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:54,810
We love you.
Busted.

286
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:58,991
Your next customer is here.
- Thanks.

287
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:02,039
Very much.
- There are still front brochures for you.

288
00:20:03,548 --> 00:20:06,216
Bride to bride, there is still
a room in June, at the Plaza.

289
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:08,880
Thank you, you are so sweet.

290
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:12,406
Mrs. St. Claire, first,
I'm obsessed by you

291
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:15,686
It is an honor ...
- Get down.

292
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:26,037
Yes.
- In June!

293
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:32,031
Watch them go, so blissful ignorance
of the difficulties ...

294
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:33,576
their marriage appointment.

295
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:38,281
June was three and
a half months removed.

296
00:20:38,282 --> 00:20:41,239
A simple nod in marriage time.

297
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,800
My dear!

298
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,787
Miss Wang.

299
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:16,387
A corselet, ten layers of tulle ...

300
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:20,252
You have to adapt.
- No.

301
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:22,795
I am wearing my mother's dress.
- Emma, are you sure?

302
00:21:22,796 --> 00:21:26,071
This is nice, but
her or your dream?

303
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:28,881
It is mine,
I want to surprise her.

304
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:32,785
But it is your day, send her
a box of chocolate on Mother.

305
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,578
And buy the dress you want?
- She is really beautiful.

306
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:38,448
And I love strapless.

307
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,345
It is as if I dress
my mother fraudulent.

308
00:21:41,346 --> 00:21:44,936
I can not do
I think my decision.

309
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,091
Hang it back.

310
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:50,930
But if you want
you must apply again.

311
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:53,994
No, you saw him first.
- A terrible reason.

312
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:58,053
We apply this, right?
- I am fit.

313
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:03,850
It is perfect.

314
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:07,175
I know. Right?

315
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:11,317
I must continue to search.
- If there is a better than Vera Wang?

316
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:14,903
Hang it there, in addition to what
better than chocolate?

317
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:18,223
Buy the dress simply.
- What if you change your mind?

318
00:22:18,224 --> 00:22:20,527
You must be careful with weight gain
for a wedding ...

319
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:23,551
you change so that he no Vera you fit
you change yourself into a Vera them.

320
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:29,591
Now seriously, I lost control?
See these eyes?

321
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:32,046
You know what that is?
Focus.

322
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:35,986
That's right.
Well, lenses and focus.

323
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,019
I buy it.
- Fantastic.

324
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,351
I get you some champagne.

325
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:50,379
Marion.

326
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:52,855
There is a terrible mistake.

327
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:58,004
A mistake never to
Marion St. Claire happened.

328
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:03,439
Your marriage has been made on the same day.

329
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,716
Say that again?
What?

330
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:08,629
Your wedding is booked for the same day.

331
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,607
Fl ...
- Are you crazy?

332
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:13,495
The Plaza is our life dream.

333
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:17,053
Angela confused the dates.

334
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:22,206
You are both on June 6 and
the other bride on June 27.

335
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:26,963
The next date is June 15.
- Well, that take me.

336
00:23:26,964 --> 00:23:29,205
Within three years.

337
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:33,372
This is ...
- I can not ...

338
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:36,989
It is not a problem.
I consultations.

339
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,549
Production is my work, I rule that
the bride of date changes.

340
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,304
Believe me, you can not no
at that face.

341
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:49,469
Yes, but by trust obligation
I can not say who she is.

342
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:53,846
Which of you two choose
another date?

343
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:59,659
I am leaving now, Miss St. Claire.
- Good advice to you ...

344
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:03,239
use me as reference.

345
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:16,954
Hello, Angela.
- Tell us any other bride who is ...

346
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,031
and nobody touched injured.

347
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:35,479
How are you?
- You look beautiful.

348
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,943
You have been covered.
- You want me to adjust my date?

349
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,010
Yes.
- No.

350
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:44,159
You take the sixth,
give me the 27th ...

351
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,457
and it is your marriage partner.
- I have your fun, really.

352
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,677
Do not touch me.
- Let's talk.

353
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:52,921
Each marriage has a cost,
what is yours?

354
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:58,655
You can not buy.
- So again a thousand times no.

355
00:24:58,835 --> 00:25:01,187
Good luck, ladies.

356
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:06,500
There is something wrong with you.

357
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:09,462
You is not leaving,
you until your ...

358
00:25:11,103 --> 00:25:13,485
Only just the date.

359
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:16,474
Are you crazy?
- I think you're crazy.

360
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:19,354
You do not want to date once you adjust.

361
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:23,035
This is unnecessary.
- Will you.

362
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:25,778
Come on, a pleasant day.

363
00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:28,162
We can sue.

364
00:25:28,163 --> 00:25:32,200
We can sue them all,
the Plaza, the Marriott, all, and Angela.

365
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,884
That is not good.
It is up to us.

366
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:37,545
I want you on my marriage,
how this uitdraait ...

367
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,802
should any of us
take a different date.

368
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:42,046
Definitely.

369
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:44,937
I want you on my wedding, of course.

370
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:49,082
If we find no other way,
will any of us need to be flexible.

371
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:52,775
Someone of us should date change.

372
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:54,919
Right, that's a possibility.

373
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,160
Perhaps not one of us,
already ten years earn ...

374
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:01,917
because they compared with others
a hunger loontje deserves.

375
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:03,475
Where.

376
00:26:03,877 --> 00:26:07,877
If the other of us,
not so desperate at the Plaza would ...

377
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:11,785
because the Plaza is the only pleasant
memory of her youth.

378
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,126
That is ...
- True.

379
00:26:15,127 --> 00:26:19,003
Someone of us should date his herzetten.
- It will for sure.

380
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:23,073
And until one of us decided
we can not make concrete plans.

381
00:26:23,074 --> 00:26:25,103
Agreed, there is some time
before we conclude.

382
00:26:25,104 --> 00:26:29,242
Let's just do nothing.
Until someone's date herzet.

383
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:37,122
Talk to you soon.
Someone we call the other.

384
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:41,857
She has not called me.
They must date it.

385
00:26:41,858 --> 00:26:44,236
She was always flexible, though as a child,
you know not?

386
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:46,696
Yes, she sounds not so flexible
I think.

387
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:53,125
Fletch I called and they took on.

388
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:56,314
He does my taxes tomorrow.
- You can not best friends.

389
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:58,283
Not now. Daniel can you
taxes yet do?

390
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,478
He is in finance.
- It is a 'hedge fund', honey.

391
00:27:00,574 --> 00:27:04,280
We do not financially together.
- He is my accountant ...

392
00:27:04,377 --> 00:27:07,801
for six years already, I will.
Do not be ridiculous.

393
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:11,072
Just do a double wedding.
- We are no 41-year-old twins.

394
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,898
Honey, a double wedding.

395
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:19,044
This is a great idea.
A great party.

396
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:23,946
No, I have my whole
life shared with Liv ...

397
00:27:23,947 --> 00:27:26,499
I wish for once a date alone.

398
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,276
I know. Is this all the guest list?
- They are on the shoebox, no idea.

399
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:33,182
It is my dream
in the Plaza to marry.

400
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:35,897
I have been saving for my 16th.

401
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:41,384
I have only a few days,
so I find another dream.

402
00:27:41,385 --> 00:27:43,917
It has better reasons than me.
- It's like 'American Idol' ...

403
00:27:43,918 --> 00:27:47,779
Liv is the Simon ...
I mean nothing.

404
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,524
But you are Paula.
Even if they can not sing ...

405
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:52,903
give them a compliment about their clothes.
That is good.

406
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,742
But anyone listening to Simon.
- I would not marry Simon.

407
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:59,020
Give me Paula.

408
00:28:02,854 --> 00:28:05,862
That is beautiful.
- Choose something ...

409
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:09,346
and find something. - Therefore, I
a bridesmaid. You may not care.

410
00:28:09,347 --> 00:28:12,206
If you want to compete,
you know what to do.

411
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:14,158
The sooner the better.
We must let our guests know.

412
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,156
Exactly, so I kept the date back.

413
00:28:17,157 --> 00:28:19,024
You do not worry.
- There is not.

414
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:21,147
Well, take your phone on it.
- Hello.

415
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,548
Men.
- Hey, Fletch.

416
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:27,371
No, not much. Only our
invitations to the rescue.

417
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,973
Is tomorrow still?
- Yes, you have some progress?

418
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:35,512
Liv is already there?
- No, she does not really admit.

419
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,589
They have a week more.
This is a century in the women's world.

420
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,812
What do they do with weddings?
- I have no idea.

421
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:46,685
Just the wrong time for your husband
to know that you are crazy.

422
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:48,844
Do you?
So I would not tackle.

423
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:52,742
She is here, I see you tomorrow?

424
00:28:53,347 --> 00:28:55,546
Hi.
- Hello, darling.

425
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:58,741
How did the cheerleaders?
- I hate it.

426
00:28:58,942 --> 00:29:03,806
I hate for teenage girls
insist on anything.

427
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:07,693
Aggressive, as if nothing else.

428
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,117
I call Liv.

429
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,516
Really?
- Yes.

430
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:19,663
Amie and Marissa will jointly
that party for us, and ...

431
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:22,469
it will be good for everything
behind us to have.

432
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:24,987
Are you sure?
- Yes.

433
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:28,358
Yes, I agree.
I spoke to Daniel, she is alone.

434
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,927
You can call her, they are
their invitations to save or something.

435
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:32,523
What?

436
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:34,193
Call her.

437
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:39,485
You must know real date ...

438
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:44,112
for you to send invitations.

439
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,054
We would wait.

440
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:51,837
And she ...
I believe it hardly.

441
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:54,703
Can you not believe?
It is Liv hear.

442
00:29:54,704 --> 00:29:57,926
She wants to be the first.
- No, not this time.

443
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:04,884
I am also a bride.
I am also number one.

444
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:09,023
You're my number one.
If I think about it.

445
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:14,558
What are you doing?

446
00:30:15,051 --> 00:30:19,273
Subject: Emergency,
this is not spam.

447
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:23,151
I go get married, six in June.
- You should not push so hard.

448
00:30:23,152 --> 00:30:27,039
The Plaza hotel.
Be there ... XOXOKJA, SD

449
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:34,449
Address book. To everyone,
no, not you Liv. And send.

450
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:44,323
Emergency,
this is not spam.

451
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:48,679
I go get married, six in June.

452
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:53,458
KJA?

453
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:58,190
What is KJA, Emma?

454
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:03,852
'Great, Emma's wedding is
better than ours are, Glenn.

455
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:07,802
Perhaps our marriage
even better.

456
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:11,205
Not filled with loneliness and sorrow.

457
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:15,189
I hope you understand in
position Amy and I are.

458
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:17,803
We choose no side.
- Relax.

459
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:21,241
We plan not until
we have fish.

460
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:24,897
You go so well with it.
- Why not?

461
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:29,509
Without a way to choose is Emma's red
the day 'e-mail is not a bit tasteless.

462
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,945
I mean, the sixth in the June
Plaza and a smiley?

463
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:36,717
What next? A heart over the i.
What do they not?

464
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:39,641
That is so tasteless.

465
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:41,722
Is it not amazing.

466
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:50,117
Elizabeth, I think my ring great.

467
00:31:56,878 --> 00:32:01,789
You sent your invitations?
- Yes, actually.

468
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:07,565
Surprised?

469
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,086
So both of us ...

470
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:13,519
moved its date?

471
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,255
You really surprised me, Liv.

472
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:24,636
You never asked me what I wanted,
you did just what you deemed best.

473
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:28,685
Emma is saying this ...
Well, Emma is the most tired.

474
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,802
Do not think that I have not noticed,
I fully panikeerde ...

475
00:32:30,803 --> 00:32:32,819
since I first
dared to be engaged.

476
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,374
First and foremost, Daniel bought
the ring in December.

477
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,887
So officially, I was first.
- Pathetic.

478
00:32:38,888 --> 00:32:42,883
Secondly, people can still
things you do not want.

479
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:45,024
As if you have no backbone.

480
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:48,962
Oh right, you have no backbone.

481
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:53,941
I do not accuse you of weakness.

482
00:32:53,942 --> 00:32:57,731
You took the first date in June,
without me even asking.

483
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:01,035
I'm at least not as
afraid to be alone ...

484
00:33:01,036 --> 00:33:04,355
people that I should order
through life to come.

485
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:09,243
Emma, you take pleasure.
- Say you, I take pleasure in Fletcher?

486
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:13,512
I thought not Fletcher.
Since you started on.

487
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:22,428
Herzet your date, Liv.
- Do you think it.

488
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:31,150
That has happened. You lose.

489
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,936
Your wedding can better be careful.

490
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:40,959
What did you just now?

491
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,531
I said that your wedding now
be very afraid.

492
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:46,755
If I was your wedding, then
I would sleep with one eye open.

493
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,538
Why do you
threats for Daniel?

494
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:53,794
Do you have his proposal
not removed, anyway?

495
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:56,706
So I did.
- Your wedding in the pot.

496
00:33:56,707 --> 00:34:00,096
What you just said about my wedding?
- Your wedding in the pot.

497
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:03,740
Your wedding can ...
I mean ...

498
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:08,427
can not ...

499
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,932
Please say.

500
00:34:12,455 --> 00:34:14,625
Bye, ladies.
- Hey, Liv.

501
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:16,450
Yes?

502
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,585
Your wedding will be huge.

503
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:23,388
Just like your ass on the prom
of school.

504
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:27,480
It is enough.

505
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:31,425
Emma and Fletcher, ...
On Saturday, the sixth of June, five hours ...

506
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:34,137
On Saturday, the sixth of June, five hours ...
Olivia and Daniel ...

507
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:38,625
Sixth of June at five o'clock.
Agreed.

508
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:40,802
Agreed.

509
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:44,562
Well, now only a
other bridesmaid.

510
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:47,351
And soon as you spend more
time with her than with the group.

511
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:50,084
Friends choose no party.
- Why should a friend?

512
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:53,908
No, no, just a bridesmaid.
Yes, eredame.

513
00:34:56,028 --> 00:35:00,096
Yes, we were so close to the law school.

514
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:03,323
Honey, you are my second
best friend of my cousin ...

515
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:06,709
Of course, you first on my list.
Really.

516
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,246
Carla, Kaitlin?

517
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:12,730
Erin, no, I did not
he slept.

518
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:16,924
Okay, anyway.
Actually once.

519
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,124
Twice.

520
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,590
What is that?
He was a layabout.

521
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:24,032
He was lazy.

522
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:27,201
Is that so?
Really, I did not ...

523
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,025
Two children?
That must have been handsome.

524
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:34,641
Yes, tell him hello from me.

525
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:38,810
I'm actually in a taxi,
so I gotta go.

526
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:45,958
Kevin?

527
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,375
Yes.

528
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:51,998
I want you graduate.

529
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,877
Until erebruidsman.

530
00:35:55,393 --> 00:35:58,590
Word you have paid?

531
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:01,249
It's just an honor.

532
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:05,397
I have a design for the classroom.
I think it is a great idea.

533
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:08,382
Because if you class something designed ...

534
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,013
Thankfully, you read on.

535
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:13,733
Read it for yourself.

536
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:19,847
Did you receive my note?
Can you take my late buscontrole?

537
00:36:20,048 --> 00:36:21,604
Sure.

538
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,959
Deb ...
- Yes?

539
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:29,913
We are not really friends but ...
- Are we not?

540
00:36:30,114 --> 00:36:32,954
Why I am proof you favor?
- That you do not.

541
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,846
Forget it.

542
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:40,193
Wil you be my bridesmaid?
- Can I choose my own dress?

543
00:36:40,394 --> 00:36:42,362
All eyes are focused on me,
it must be good.

544
00:36:42,563 --> 00:36:44,515
Absolutely.

545
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:50,612
I suggest something natural.
- I have a lot of help though.

546
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:54,684
What is the bride, do you think?
For the bridesmaid to help, right?

547
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,975
Come on, please?
- Okay.

548
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:02,649
Because you begged.
I'm your bridesmaid.

549
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,731
It is great.

550
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,320
It is great.

551
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:19,906
May I propose something?
Have you ever heard of Pinot Grigio?

552
00:37:20,202 --> 00:37:23,849
This is a really good white wine,
very elegant.

553
00:37:26,602 --> 00:37:32,080
Your music is still around.
DJ Humple is not available to date.

554
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,760
But I had an appointment with him.
In principle.

555
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:39,300
One of my other brides
gave a higher bid.

556
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:43,227
I can not say who, of course.
- The slut.

557
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:47,862
Not you, another.
The person.

558
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,125
She is frightening.

559
00:37:54,997 --> 00:37:56,873
You do not think Liv ...
- Yes it is.

560
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:00,068
She knows what that meant for me.
It is too cruel.

561
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:02,444
Typically something for her.

562
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:07,783
Hey, I know.
Did you not think they would wear Vera Wang?

563
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:09,176
Yes.

564
00:38:09,377 --> 00:38:13,310
I read that they are quite tight.
She was formerly quite thick?

565
00:38:13,511 --> 00:38:14,496
No.

566
00:38:14,697 --> 00:38:18,168
No, she is ...

567
00:38:23,073 --> 00:38:26,140
This is good.

568
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:27,101
Great.

569
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,805
Just cream cheese.
It is cream, I test it.

570
00:38:32,006 --> 00:38:35,367
Emma has her cake already chosen?
- Let us to remain.

571
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:38,439
As for the flowers ...
'U-Floria has ...

572
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,657
I do not have the same pie. And I want
white chocolate cake with seven layers.

573
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:47,423
Covered with marzipan.
With curls and flowers.

574
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:52,385
Then you're safe. Emma has a
smaller pie chosen.

575
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:56,783
And she wants people to
see how much they can spend.

576
00:38:56,984 --> 00:39:00,346
I just checked my even ice sculptures.

577
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,198
My heaven.

578
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:05,616
That was a pitch to me.

579
00:39:07,485 --> 00:39:10,525
Emma thinks that I want to show off.

580
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,235
I thought I had to show
how much money I earn.

581
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,953
Really, I did not understand.
- Marriott, eat it.

582
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,937
She Emma prefer.

583
00:39:22,138 --> 00:39:25,335
Emma getting the sympathy vote.
I will never, right?

584
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:28,641
Maybe it takes too much of people.
- I was worried about cake.

585
00:39:28,842 --> 00:39:31,430
In my chocolate
monticule with whipped cream.

586
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:39,320
Stop, what's that?

587
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:53,115
Dance lessons?
She is damn competitive.

588
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:55,896
Her dance will be better than ours.
Do just once canaries singing.

589
00:39:56,197 --> 00:39:59,943
Lark, canary.
Why is there nothing in between?

590
00:40:00,562 --> 00:40:03,041
Serve as a canary burnt.
- Video of their lives?

591
00:40:03,342 --> 00:40:04,777
Really?

592
00:40:05,078 --> 00:40:08,711
That must be Fletcher's idea.
Perhaps baby pictures of Emma ...

593
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,601
with a tooth or Fletcher
in a superheldenpak.

594
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:13,063
Tasteless.

595
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:16,620
Can I help you?
- Yes, order for Liv Lerner.

596
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:19,249
This is chocolate.
Admit it.

597
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:24,557
It is good.
You deserve this more, Liv.

598
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:28,200
Daniel Is not the sweetest?
I assume there is only one.

599
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:29,769
These.

600
00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:35,954
Was she present?
- Yes.

601
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:39,319
And it is impossible to
of retrieval?

602
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,525
She has already eaten half the box.
That is 45 dollars.

603
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:47,724
That is what we had agreed.
But you do know ...

604
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:52,374
If you knew what is really going on,
would you my side.

605
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,881
Please do not tip?
- I thought that there Saturday

606
00:40:54,882 --> 00:40:58,550
Anyway, I give you,
because I am a Paula.

607
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:02,431
Suppose you really Emma
its beginning to peddle dance.

608
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,434
Then there are ways.

609
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:06,119
Tell me more.

610
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,307
I do not know, maybe dance?

611
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:15,206
We know how to dance,
it is a slow. Just like in school.

612
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:18,459
It is a rod,
that should just accurate.

613
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:23,177
Anyway, Marion says that our
beginning of our relationship style dance shows.

614
00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:26,826
Well, I am very concerned
on our relationship style.

615
00:41:26,822 --> 00:41:29,815
Place.

616
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:37,219
I'm Rick Coo.
The Doctor of Dance. "

617
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,577
I get your emotion and rhythm.

618
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:42,670
I get your sex.

619
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:46,195
Put you please
on your feet and dance.

620
00:41:46,196 --> 00:41:47,526
Are you ready for this?

621
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:10,663
Perhaps the Coo Rick Marion
'Doctor of Dance' is not so recommend.

622
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:12,292
That Ricky.

623
00:42:12,723 --> 00:42:15,237
Well done, you warm up.

624
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:19,922
I received your voice-mail,
you of a lesson to four wanted.

625
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:22,248
How long are you here?

626
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:25,242
My heaven.

627
00:42:25,965 --> 00:42:28,191
What?
- Liv.

628
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:32,409
Give us a minute.

629
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:37,694
Who does that?
She is completely crazy, not surprising.

630
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,488
That is they always have been.
- I know.

631
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:43,752
And they are worthless to our relationship style,
I do not let that happen.

632
00:42:43,753 --> 00:42:45,728
Good.

633
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,185
I think it is bad for Daniel.

634
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:51,118
He can even his own wife
not in place.

635
00:42:51,828 --> 00:42:53,377
What?

636
00:42:54,723 --> 00:42:57,662
I say that Liv behind it,
because they never think about ...

637
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,908
I go inside.
- What?

638
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:02,638
Last month
for the big day ...

639
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,117
is a test for couples
how they work ...

640
00:43:06,118 --> 00:43:08,490
Troubleshooting
and communicate.

641
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:13,861
The happy time is over,
and overcome nerves.

642
00:43:13,862 --> 00:43:18,339
Some couples will
this conflicts with them.

643
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:25,305
For the lucky among the flocks,
This brings the harmony above.

644
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:29,859
But even they must have something
order to respond.

645
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:32,468
For me?
'Jolly Wallis cake bouquet.

646
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:35,384
Will I, or not?
- Be careful.

647
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:37,666
Miss Wang is a strict mistress.
- A video.

648
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:40,608
There are photographs,
and videos?

649
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:43,365
Yes, at least one short film.
- I am not even ...

650
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:45,602
I do not know how I want it
We must get.

651
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:49,193
This is for you by a courier.
- I can not wait to view it.

652
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:52,597
Hr. Simmons has already called to ask
to an update on the agreement.

653
00:43:52,598 --> 00:43:56,112
Rutherford Press, which is
my birth place.

654
00:43:56,113 --> 00:43:59,046
I will say that you
in a crisis is?

655
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:04,219
They have continued engagement -
to announce.

656
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:07,480
Just that I am a celebrity
or something ...

657
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:10,916
girl from the neighborhood made it.
Dear people.

658
00:44:12,605 --> 00:44:14,780
Girls from the village to marry both
in the Plaza Hotel

659
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:17,672
That is you, do you?
Emma looks beautiful from.

660
00:44:18,694 --> 00:44:21,387
But not within, that is ...

661
00:44:22,135 --> 00:44:25,305
This is the best thing they can do, right?

662
00:44:25,305 --> 00:44:27,111
As meaningless.

663
00:44:27,112 --> 00:44:30,403
Want to play dirty? I can do.
- I see you do.

664
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,485
I have studied law, people.

665
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:34,731
I am beginning to think that
30 border.

666
00:44:34,732 --> 00:44:38,061
This is the last time, that men want
with women their own age.

667
00:44:38,062 --> 00:44:40,488
And man, 30, assumes
with a girl of 30 ...

668
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:42,562
but a man of 35 would
one of thirty.

669
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:44,475
And a man of forty would
someone of 32.

670
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:46,799
Or 28.

671
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:49,292
It is a horrible planet.
- I know.

672
00:44:49,293 --> 00:44:51,000
You know what I asked?

673
00:44:51,001 --> 00:44:53,641
What is the real cause of Emma and Fletcher
that stick to that date ...

674
00:44:53,642 --> 00:44:55,633
why can they date
be done.

675
00:44:55,634 --> 00:44:57,759
Think about it.

676
00:44:59,884 --> 00:45:01,917
She is pregnant.
Emma is pregnant.

677
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:06,652
No!

678
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:12,160
No!
- Liv, are you okay with you?

679
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:15,211
What the fuck is going on?
Let me in there.

680
00:45:15,891 --> 00:45:18,574
I am 5 pounds arrived. 5 pounds.
It could just as well be 50.

681
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:20,968
The dress does not fit, and if
the dress does not fit ...

682
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:24,607
my wedding will be a black hole are
in the history of the Plaza.

683
00:45:25,787 --> 00:45:27,343
A, it is our wedding, baby.

684
00:45:27,544 --> 00:45:30,065
And B, so what, let it make widespread.

685
00:45:30,266 --> 00:45:35,651
You change Vera Wang not to apply
you change yourself to adapt to Vera.

686
00:45:36,713 --> 00:45:39,346
What guys learn in school?
- Sorry.

687
00:45:39,547 --> 00:45:42,848
It is not the end of the world.
Really.

688
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:45,513
What can I do that
you feel better?

689
00:45:45,714 --> 00:45:48,747
Stop what you're doing.
This is all your fault.

690
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:51,699
It is that you love me sweets
sent, but ...

691
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,578
What kind of candy?

692
00:45:55,162 --> 00:45:58,024
You know, the sweets,
who Truffle appels.

693
00:45:59,437 --> 00:46:01,196
This dish with truffles.

00:46:01,497 --> 00:46:04,262

695
00:46:05,834 --> 00:46:08,826
The international club butter?
- Honey ...

696
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:12,686
I have sent you nothing.
- My God, Emma.

697
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:16,492
They try to make me fat, so I
my dress is no longer useful. What is that?

698
00:46:16,793 --> 00:46:18,538
What is that?

699
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:25,937
The international club butter?

700
00:46:26,238 --> 00:46:30,949
You've really eaten pieces of butter
from different countries?

701
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:38,957
The last week before the wedding is
come, it's all or nothing.

702
00:46:39,258 --> 00:46:42,910
I expect that my brides
perfect.

703
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:46,365
Great hair, skin, nails, everything.

704
00:46:47,663 --> 00:46:50,940
Hello there. I have to go back very quickly.

705
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,918
Very fast. I have just yesterday
forgotten, and that is very important.

706
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:55,914
That may me not care.

707
00:46:56,215 --> 00:46:58,895
Go back.

708
00:47:04,045 --> 00:47:05,586
Miss Ellen.
- Hello.

709
00:47:05,887 --> 00:47:07,972
Honingwit today, since what I like.
- Yes, but ...

710
00:47:08,273 --> 00:47:10,439
with a little touch for the wedding.

711
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,305
Of course.
- Good, thanks.

712
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:49,214
What happened to you?

713
00:47:49,515 --> 00:47:51,433
You look like a traffic spy.

714
00:47:51,734 --> 00:47:55,584
Blurs that?
- Iet or whatever, I'm really nervous.

715
00:47:55,885 --> 00:48:00,869
Is it so bad?
Fletch said that it was not so bad.

716
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:04,846
Fletch is your fiance. He said
probably also that you had good hair.

717
00:48:06,972 --> 00:48:09,726
If a wedding is not just something.
- That's for sure.

718
00:48:10,127 --> 00:48:13,722
I am surprised that I not
my therapist about.

719
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:15,598
I have heard. 'TUFF'.

720
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:19,719
I was talking by phone with
boy verperst had my table decorations.

721
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,415
It is unbelievable.
One thing after another.

722
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,521
Snowballs.
- Can I have some more 'lowlights' get?

723
00:48:25,922 --> 00:48:28,046
Yes here, remember what you wanted to say, I
suit your color, right?

724
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,614
Make sure that it is not so ...
More like gold beige.

725
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:48,357
Maybe I should turn to 'chanting' go
do. It is perhaps necessary.

726
00:48:54,003 --> 00:48:56,485
My God.
- My God?

727
00:48:56,886 --> 00:48:59,375
Is it good?

728
00:48:59,776 --> 00:49:02,211
I can ...

729
00:49:06,084 --> 00:49:08,313
I do not know what happened ...

730
00:49:08,714 --> 00:49:12,679
I let it sit for two days, maybe
I can increase it to white ...

731
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,342
My hair is blue!

732
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,826
It is blue!

733
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:18,999
I have blue hair.

734
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,757
I married in a week.
- Congratulations.

735
00:49:22,158 --> 00:49:24,024
About a week!

736
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,317
I know you are in it.

737
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:28,846
Here is the video.

738
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:34,527
Yeah, sure.

739
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,602


739
00:49:42,602 --> 00:49:45,375
Should you tell me something?

740
00:49:46,186 --> 00:49:48,560
Are we a small orange baby?

741
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:52,924
Apparently we were registered
at 'Babies'R'Us.

742
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:54,989
Is not that nice?

743
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,385
Marissa, where are you?
I can hardly means.

744
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,501
I can not believe you
to Emma told.

745
00:50:01,902 --> 00:50:03,240
Whatever.

746
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:07,657
Do not get too attached to the dancers, they
be paid to be nice to you.

747
00:50:15,132 --> 00:50:17,606
A little birdie has just told me ...

748
00:50:17,607 --> 00:50:20,026
that an arriving here tonight
wedding present.

749
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:23,838
But it has been a very naughty bride.

750
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:27,425
Agent not your man 'is here
for you to arrest.

751
00:50:34,086 --> 00:50:37,206
You are arrested because
you are sexy.

752
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:41,903
It is time to be searched.

753
00:50:42,146 --> 00:50:43,618
Oh.

754
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:48,992
Great.

755
00:50:51,029 --> 00:50:54,295
There are two brides present tonight.

756
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:00,645
There are two brides present tonight.

757
00:51:01,046 --> 00:51:03,046
Yes, but this party is only
on invitation.

758
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:05,731
I am also married, baby.

759
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:10,608
We invite you altogether. DJ Jazz
Calls bride on stage two to come.

760
00:51:11,422 --> 00:51:13,691
Come here girl.
We want to see how you move.

761
00:51:15,236 --> 00:51:17,177
That meant I
go ahead, girl.

762
00:51:17,478 --> 00:51:20,177
Can I not even my own
bachelor party have?

763
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:24,332
DJ Humple I could not have?
That was a rock passed.

764
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:28,463
Besides, I'm not pregnant, right?

765
00:51:28,864 --> 00:51:33,559
I say its time for dancing.

766
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,385
Let me see girls.

767
00:51:50,786 --> 00:51:54,447
Come on, future brides,
I know that you can do better.

768
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:09,180
Most sexy bride gets
first prize, let me see.

769
00:52:12,483 --> 00:52:16,139
Let us begin.
Showtime.

770
00:52:26,628 --> 00:52:28,743
Look at bride number two.

771
00:52:51,554 --> 00:52:54,682
Bride number two, you are
the most sexy bride tonight, baby.

772
00:52:55,934 --> 00:52:58,613
Applause for wedding number two, everybody.

773
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:02,959
Sorry bride number one, you
can not win everything, girl.

774
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,909
That is weird, losses ...

775
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:16,565
I must say that I
not love.

776
00:53:17,066 --> 00:53:18,373
You were both so good.

777
00:53:18,874 --> 00:53:20,912
Yes, you've gone over there,
and you've really tried.

778
00:53:21,413 --> 00:53:23,875
Forget it.
It's my bachelor party, right?

779
00:53:24,376 --> 00:53:26,112
Yes.

780
00:53:27,864 --> 00:53:30,248
Well done girl, here.
- As if you read my mind.

781
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:42,427
My God.

782
00:53:44,948 --> 00:53:47,302
Taxi!

783
00:53:49,925 --> 00:53:52,525
Kevin, I need coffee.

784
00:53:52,526 --> 00:53:55,983
Sorry, I need coffee,
3 Advil ...

785
00:53:56,084 --> 00:54:00,652
four bottles of water, and look to the designation
of that lawyer, who may be.

786
00:54:00,753 --> 00:54:04,476
Hi Ilana, you work too hard,
I invite you to lunch, okay?

787
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:06,789
Where are you Kev? In the office?

787
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,389
K..K

788
00:54:13,272 --> 00:54:15,561
My God, completely forgotten.

789
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:19,600
I had an appointment at seven.

790
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:22,012
You'll love it.

791
00:54:22,213 --> 00:54:25,560
If we are on the short preparation
may refer ...

792
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:27,806
I have a few key
highlighted.

793
00:54:28,007 --> 00:54:30,861
My discovery process, and statements
documents and request ...

794
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:33,669
it has important results
returned.

795
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,469
Wait, I look at a letter
two weeks ago ...

796
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,838
where is the last one?
- I am sure that I've updated.

796
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:46,338
1

797
00:54:46,545 --> 00:54:50,161
Your hair?
- Yes, my hair is blue.

798
00:54:51,547 --> 00:54:54,181
My hair is blue, my wedding is over
a week, and I pay my bridesmaid.

799
00:54:54,382 --> 00:54:57,817
And Hr. Colson, maybe I
The letter incorrectly stored ...

800
00:54:58,018 --> 00:55:02,470
and perhaps hate my best friend
of the whole world to me.

801
00:55:02,471 --> 00:55:04,674
Hate me.

802
00:55:13,035 --> 00:55:15,379
My God.

803
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,343
I am a barren bride.

804
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,026
This is not ideal.

805
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,468
This is who we represent.
- Not anymore.

806
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:28,565
Mrs. Lerner looks at the case more
I take over.

807
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:32,148
Calm down, I let it appeared.

808
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:37,442
Ms. Lerner, you can go.

809
00:55:41,947 --> 00:55:44,217
I'm not this girl.

810
00:55:44,938 --> 00:55:48,935
I ruined not all,
I will be demoted.

811
00:55:48,936 --> 00:55:52,821
Like I have nobody, I feel
me alone.

812
00:55:57,662 --> 00:55:59,963
Honey, I'm here.

813
00:56:04,723 --> 00:56:06,695
You miss your girlfriend.

814
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:09,153
Especially now.

815
00:56:09,454 --> 00:56:11,722
They know exactly what they say.

816
00:56:12,023 --> 00:56:15,979
I am also mad at her,
they went for my hair.

817
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,357
Friends do not.

818
00:56:19,658 --> 00:56:21,566
We make it. And if you do not
you, I love it.

819
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:27,134
I really do, you are like so
a long, very sexy smurf.

820
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,731
Honey.

821
00:56:35,032 --> 00:56:37,513
It is not only about her.

822
00:56:39,926 --> 00:56:41,959
I am angry because they may
right.

823
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:47,199
You got out of there all the time
want to be perfect.

824
00:56:48,058 --> 00:56:51,491
So I did
since I was a kid.

825
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:57,915
I thought that if I get everything and everyone
for was that nothing would happen naars.

825
00:56:58,592 --> 00:56:59,815


826
00:57:01,815 --> 00:57:04,207
Life is not perfect, huh?

827
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,379
It is a mess.

828
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:12,455
You're right.

829
00:57:12,956 --> 00:57:15,014
I mean, I would be perfect for you ...

830
00:57:15,315 --> 00:57:17,781
but now you say that this is impossible ...

831
00:57:20,151 --> 00:57:21,739
You do not have to be perfect.

832
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,469
I always wanted a human woman.

833
00:57:25,425 --> 00:57:27,156
Those others are just too difficult
to blow.

833
00:57:27,425 --> 00:57:29,456


834
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:37,771
Almost back to normal.
- I know.

835
00:57:38,072 --> 00:57:40,115
I got a skin layer about
but ...

836
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:43,430
that should be good enough for our wedding
, so, sorry Liv ...

837
00:57:43,826 --> 00:57:46,150
I wish I had photos.

838
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:50,625
When I was there, and there were
the spotlight, and when I grabbed the rope ...

839
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,609
My God.
- Enough.

840
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:56,678
I did that story already ten thousand
once heard, Emma.

841
00:57:56,979 --> 00:57:59,604
You do a little game
the last time, right?

842
00:57:59,905 --> 00:58:01,733
I am tired of, so keep it on there.

843
00:58:02,034 --> 00:58:05,274
You are very angry lately, and
tense and excited, and ...

844
00:58:05,575 --> 00:58:07,410
and I do not know how I
to deal with.

845
00:58:07,711 --> 00:58:12,324
I wonder whether that has anything to do
with the wedding ...

846
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:15,784
or that this is permanent.
- Well, Fletcher, this is permanent.

847
00:58:16,085 --> 00:58:18,858
It may be possible that I am evil
or am tense ...

848
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:20,858
or excited for the next 40 years.
- Is that really so?

849
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:22,927
You do it again.
- What?

850
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:25,417
You are not hateful, but ...

851
00:58:26,535 --> 00:58:28,773
I did not hateful, but you are
nearby.

852
00:58:30,178 --> 00:58:31,704
You would have to take taxi
and make a U turn ...

853
00:58:32,005 --> 00:58:33,776
and you let off on the corner
of fun and nice.

854
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,007
Fletcher, are you angry because stuff
with Liv ...

855
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:38,509
Absolutely.
- It is difficult for you to understand.

856
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,953
My God, I'm angry because you
have feelings, right in the bull's-eye.

857
00:58:42,254 --> 00:58:45,514
In other words do not so much
feelings, as if I have ...

858
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:49,946
let them not see. I would not so much ...
- I can not even talk to you.

859
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:52,179
You have not tried.
You realize you ...

860
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,168
you know how difficult it is for me, you
I even tried to ask ...

861
00:58:56,469 --> 00:58:59,442
how I feel.
I am so confused.

862
00:58:59,742 --> 00:59:01,441
I recognize you no more.

863
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,970
Well, I want to talk.

864
00:59:15,735 --> 00:59:18,479
It is a tense time, a lot of fun,
whatever, I go to the gym

865
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,361
Goodbye.

866
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:33,101
The office of Liv Lerner.
- Hi, Kevin. With Emma.

867
01:00:33,402 --> 01:00:35,345
Liv Is there?

868
01:00:35,646 --> 01:00:37,143
Can you wait. A moment.
- Thank you.

869
01:00:37,444 --> 01:00:39,322
Sorry.
- Beautiful eyes.

870
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,832
Sorry, Liv has a crisis,
can call them back?

871
01:00:44,136 --> 01:00:46,962
Well, I understand.

872
01:00:50,503 --> 01:00:52,553
Sorry, with whom I speak?

873
01:00:52,854 --> 01:00:54,484
Hello.

874
01:01:20,368 --> 01:01:22,148
How are you?
- Long ago, huh?

875
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:24,335
I know. My fault, I am
very busy.

876
01:01:24,736 --> 01:01:26,876
Yes, pressure. This has nothing to do
the fact ...

877
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:30,302
I am the brother of your best enemy?
I mean your best friend.

878
01:01:31,898 --> 01:01:33,637
I need a tuxedo rentals, you
with me.

879
01:01:33,938 --> 01:01:35,832
Come on.

880
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:37,723
Well, I am a bit surprised ...

881
01:01:38,024 --> 01:01:39,875
I thought that a large magazine writer
his smoking would have.

882
01:01:55,234 --> 01:01:56,807
How are you, Em?

883
01:01:57,108 --> 01:01:59,384
How do you feel?

884
01:02:00,209 --> 01:02:02,212
I feel good.

885
01:02:03,582 --> 01:02:05,157
Good is not really a feeling.

886
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,454
That is a feeling.

887
01:02:07,755 --> 01:02:09,575
I feel good. That you can say.
People say that.

888
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:11,455
Yes, of course. That you can say.

889
01:02:13,793 --> 01:02:15,387
Well, it's like ...

890
01:02:16,531 --> 01:02:18,367
It's a mad house with the wedding,
and ...

891
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,824
all these details, and ...

892
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:24,309
I have this idea of what it would be
in my head ...

893
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,216
and ...

894
01:02:26,517 --> 01:02:29,178
it's not so fun.

895
01:02:30,996 --> 01:02:32,657
And I do not know why.

896
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,536
But most time I feel good.

897
01:02:40,406 --> 01:02:42,215
Let your das good. To
as a tie, I can not see.

898
01:02:42,516 --> 01:02:43,939
That does not look good.
- Change the subject.

899
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,297
Das.

900
01:02:46,598 --> 01:02:48,277
How about that tie-pin,
I can not.

901
01:02:48,578 --> 01:02:50,582
You just have no patience.
- Really.

902
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:56,970
I think I've waited too long.

903
01:03:02,122 --> 01:03:03,623
Go you drink coffee?

904
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:08,370
I'm already late ...
But I call you.

905
01:03:09,859 --> 01:03:12,270
But ...
You look ...

906
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:14,954
you look ...
You will be a great ...

907
01:03:16,747 --> 01:03:18,365
'bruidweggever are.

908
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:20,368
Thank you.

909
01:03:20,669 --> 01:03:22,805
And Em, you are really a beautiful bride.

910
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:26,304
Yes?
- Yes, I have always thought.

911
01:03:26,605 --> 01:03:28,783
Thank you. Day.

912
01:03:53,493 --> 01:03:57,901
Despite everything, when the morning dawned
that the sixth June ...

913
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:00,486
it was the perfect day
for a wedding.

914
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:03,769
Right. Two weddings.

915
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:07,576
Three hours people, monitor your
camps, enter your work ...

916
01:04:08,877 --> 01:04:10,166
and we might come alive.
- Incoming, people.

917
01:04:16,177 --> 01:04:17,741
Roses for Lerner, peonies for Allen.

918
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:20,305
Has the pastor of Allen has been reported?
- Yes.

919
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:21,921
Tablecloths for Lerner. - Yes.
Excellent.

920
01:04:22,222 --> 01:04:25,606
Hurry up people, this is
no rehearsal.

921
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:41,063
Liv, my God, you're the most beautiful bride
I have ever seen.

922
01:04:41,364 --> 01:04:43,228
Thank you.

923
01:04:44,433 --> 01:04:46,193
Excuse me a minute.

924
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:49,688
It is so strange.

925
01:04:50,842 --> 01:04:53,299
I'm so nervous.
I do not know why.

926
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,841
Is that not to go?
- Yes. Why?

927
01:04:57,896 --> 01:04:59,744
I do not know.
You look good.

928
01:05:00,145 --> 01:05:04,150
Honestly, the pressure that we are on the brides
submit today ...

929
01:05:04,551 --> 01:05:06,788
you look perfect.
Just ridiculous.

930
01:05:07,289 --> 01:05:10,418
You do not look your best
on your wedding day ...

931
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:13,213
good everyone? Mama?

932
01:05:15,405 --> 01:05:18,002
If you want my opinion ...
- No, I do not want your opinion.

933
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:22,862
What?

934
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:26,661
Deb, I have my whole life
versions of you, and ...

935
01:05:26,762 --> 01:05:30,164
I tell you something that I long
ago against me had to say.

936
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,545
Sometimes it is about me. Good?
Not all the time.

937
01:05:32,646 --> 01:05:35,062
But once in a while, it is
my time. Like today.

938
01:05:35,163 --> 01:05:37,354
If you do not mind, it is your
free to go.

939
01:05:37,455 --> 01:05:39,638
But if you stay, then you
your work.

940
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:43,250
And that means laugh and talk about
my beauty as a bride ...

941
01:05:43,351 --> 01:05:45,556
and most importantly, ensure
that it is not your run.

942
01:05:45,657 --> 01:05:47,146
Good? Can you do that?

943
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:50,091
Yes, I would like to.

944
01:05:50,192 --> 01:05:54,310
Then everything is good.
- Harp Player for Allen, quartet for Lerner.

945
01:05:54,411 --> 01:05:56,677
How often should I repeat myself yet.

946
01:05:59,354 --> 01:06:01,861
Check the status of the bride,
and take your battle positions.

947
01:06:03,702 --> 01:06:06,109
If you get back from one wedding,
let other members know, so ...

948
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,961
because we can rotate,
- Well, I go to ...

949
01:06:08,062 --> 01:06:10,039
the ceremony of Liv, and
the reception of Emma.

950
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:13,400
I go see the bachelor,
and snacks.

951
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,227
Hello, Paul.
- Allen Lerner.

952
01:06:18,427 --> 01:06:20,771
Hello, Hr. Allen. How are you?

953
01:06:20,972 --> 01:06:22,904
I 'm good. How are you?
- Great day, huh?

954
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:25,896
Yes, it is.
- I have a blink of Emma absorbed.

955
01:06:26,096 --> 01:06:27,884
When I was the enemy camp
to the viewing.

956
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:30,471
She is beautiful, sir.

957
01:06:30,572 --> 01:06:32,333
Thank you, Nathan.

958
01:06:32,529 --> 01:06:36,327
Can I talk with your sister? No
that row, but about something else.

959
01:06:36,428 --> 01:06:38,468
Yes, of course.

960
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,943
Hello, Hr. Allen.

961
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,599
Your father and mother will be so proud.
- Thank you

962
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,795
On both of you.

963
01:06:55,796 --> 01:06:59,470
Thank you
- I want you to give a blessing ...

964
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:01,248
of our generation.

965
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:03,303
Not myself, but ...

966
01:07:05,784 --> 01:07:09,113
My dear friends, that everything
would have had to be here ...

967
01:07:09,214 --> 01:07:11,269
today.

968
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:13,675
Good luck, honey.

969
01:07:13,776 --> 01:07:16,287
Nathan.
- Hr. Allen, thank you.

970
01:07:16,388 --> 01:07:18,600
Good to see you.
- You too.

971
01:07:20,304 --> 01:07:22,127
Such a good man.

972
01:07:22,228 --> 01:07:24,332
Dad looks so much like him.

973
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:26,901
According to Miss St. Claire ...

974
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:30,603
can you take a sip
the wedding ...

975
01:07:30,704 --> 01:07:32,333
to the nerves under restraints.
So we have Scotch ...

976
01:07:32,434 --> 01:07:34,156
Scotch is good.

977
01:07:34,157 --> 01:07:38,503
Vodka and tequila.
- Tequilla!

978
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:42,236
Kevin! Tequila, no.

979
01:07:42,337 --> 01:07:46,796
Bring it to you
Marion, I say that the DVD's have changed.

980
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:49,320
He needs to play Emma. Go.

981
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:54,192
I know. Go.
Come on.

982
01:08:00,026 --> 01:08:01,839
One day you'll thank me.

983
01:08:03,077 --> 01:08:05,314
I'm open.
- That is very helpful.

984
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,942
Thank you.

985
01:08:07,043 --> 01:08:09,626
My God, your parents. Come inside.

986
01:08:09,727 --> 01:08:12,567
Is not it a beauty of a bride?

987
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:15,599
That she is sure. Oh.

988
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,044
My God, this is my dress?

989
01:08:20,668 --> 01:08:23,552
Are you happy?
- I'm happy when you are happy ...

990
01:08:23,653 --> 01:08:26,551
honey, you can in a brown paper bag
married, that I would not care to.

991
01:08:26,652 --> 01:08:29,024
This is your day.

992
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:34,040
I needed a handkerchief.

993
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:37,760
My God, I cry.
- You ruined your makeup, darling.

994
01:08:37,861 --> 01:08:40,271
I found this when we
Bocca moved.

995
01:08:40,372 --> 01:08:42,189
I have kept.

996
01:08:43,344 --> 01:08:45,282
I knew that one day came that I
that you would give.

997
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:50,085
Go ahead. Make it open.

998
01:08:57,937 --> 01:09:00,481
Because you need something old,
and blue.

999
01:09:01,392 --> 01:09:05,621
It is actually Liv.
- Something borrowed, then.

1000
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,277
Daddy, I must see her.

1001
01:09:17,378 --> 01:09:19,637
I think they also feel.

1002
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:22,518
I'm open.

1003
01:09:25,765 --> 01:09:27,576
It is Marion.

1004
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:31,376
At your place of people.
We are about two minutes to start.

1005
01:09:31,477 --> 01:09:34,404
Marion, I briefly go into the hallway?

1006
01:09:34,505 --> 01:09:38,464
Emma, you're the most beautiful bride
I have ever seen.

1007
01:09:38,965 --> 01:09:41,609
Ready? We walk.

1008
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,504
A bride runs.

1009
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:58,553
Time.

1010
01:10:54,562 --> 01:10:56,170
Madam?

1011
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,742
Well.
- My God. I am married.

1012
01:11:12,938 --> 01:11:15,217
Are you happy?

1013
01:11:17,197 --> 01:11:19,294
If I give the confirmation that one bride
to walk ...

1014
01:11:19,395 --> 01:11:21,334
video shows five start recording.

1015
01:11:21,435 --> 01:11:23,923
And ready.

1016
01:11:24,555 --> 01:11:27,225
Walk.

1017
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:47,725
I am in Acapulco, baby.

1018
01:11:47,826 --> 01:11:51,662
I'm here.

1019
01:11:55,034 --> 01:11:57,254
I want to dance.

1020
01:12:02,965 --> 01:12:05,132
Let see what, Emma.

1021
01:12:05,283 --> 01:12:07,436
I just want to dance.

1022
01:12:20,098 --> 01:12:21,722
We are caught,
I repeat, caught.

1023
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:39,663
Emma!

1024
01:12:40,407 --> 01:12:42,620
Let me tell you something ...

1025
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:46,588
This mess,
I would never do.

1026
01:12:49,576 --> 01:12:52,566
Let them do it.

1027
01:12:53,325 --> 01:12:54,508
Come on.

1028
01:12:57,051 --> 01:12:59,555
Liv, I would tell you what ..

1029
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,686
Let me tell you something.
- I do not want to fight.

1030
01:13:02,787 --> 01:13:06,637
It is done.
I can not anymore.

1031
01:13:09,735 --> 01:13:13,694
I can not anymore.

1032
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,152
Thank God.

1033
01:14:07,752 --> 01:14:09,749
It is all right.

1034
01:14:12,336 --> 01:14:15,233
Emma, what are you doing now?
Are not you crazy?

1035
01:14:15,427 --> 01:14:17,145
You just ruined our marriage,
are you happy now?

1036
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:20,445
Your girlfriend is past, because she has always
a bad influence on you.

1037
01:14:20,546 --> 01:14:23,093
This DVD assess you to
more than I thought of her.

1038
01:14:23,194 --> 01:14:25,863
Good I hope.
- What?

1039
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:29,072
Fletcher, you're already
ten years my friend.

1040
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:32,758
And you must also now
and tell me the truth.

1041
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:36,278
You are in love with a girl
Your ten years ago met.

1042
01:14:36,379 --> 01:14:38,171
What is wrong with that?

1043
01:14:40,311 --> 01:14:42,487
It is not there anymore.

1044
01:14:45,278 --> 01:14:47,831
I do not want my whole
life squabble.

1045
01:14:48,616 --> 01:14:50,404
We dig us.

1046
01:14:51,309 --> 01:14:54,059
And you want that.

1047
01:14:57,491 --> 01:15:01,543
We are different.
We want different things.

1048
01:15:04,845 --> 01:15:07,643
You know it's true or not?

1049
01:15:12,612 --> 01:15:14,399
I know.

1050
01:15:34,638 --> 01:15:36,968
Goodbye.

1051
01:15:48,305 --> 01:15:51,029
I'm fine.

1052
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:53,300
This is all my fault.

1053
01:15:53,401 --> 01:15:57,454
That video had never happened.
But really ...

1054
01:15:57,555 --> 01:16:00,090
I had been terminated
I wish you that.

1055
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:03,855
Emma, you're my best friend.
- Our fight is so crazy.

1056
01:16:07,023 --> 01:16:08,208
Excuse me so.

1057
01:16:08,208 --> 01:16:09,996
Excuse me.

1058
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:16,258
I am so sorry 

1058
01:16:16,258 --> 01:16:20,258


1059
01:16:20,936 --> 01:16:23,885
If I've ruined it for you,
I do not anymore.

1060
01:16:25,425 --> 01:16:29,084
If Fletcher and I perfectly
for each other ...

1061
01:16:29,297 --> 01:16:34,763
than we are now married.

1062
01:16:37,101 --> 01:16:41,499
Did you now?
- Yes, a whole new me.

1063
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,932
I did all the time.

1064
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:47,457
God knows who ...
- No ...

1065
01:16:47,558 --> 01:16:50,940
Excuse me.
- No, you're right.

1066
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:55,375
I should not constant
one another.

1067
01:16:55,993 --> 01:17:00,373
It resembles a giant
'wake up call. "

1068
01:17:00,474 --> 01:17:02,910
I turned it around a bit, but ...

1069
01:17:04,352 --> 01:17:06,083
I am awake.

1070
01:17:09,674 --> 01:17:14,569
Wil je vanvoor are together?
- Where else would I say?

1071
01:17:23,276 --> 01:17:26,979
What do you think?
Back from zero.

1072
01:17:38,228 --> 01:17:43,252
I almost forgot something.
- My God, Em.

1073
01:17:43,845 --> 01:17:48,381
Where have you found?
- Two little girls kept it for us.

1074
01:17:50,746 --> 01:17:52,282
Forward.

1075
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,074
Are you single?
- Yes.

1076
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:25,449
Are you straight?
- I do not like labels.

1077
01:18:27,434 --> 01:18:33,790
Excuse me if you divorce.
- Why? It is only my first.

1078
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:37,075
And next time faith
I certainly in the Plaza.

1079
01:18:47,116 --> 01:18:50,201
Let's go dancing.
- Yes, good.

1080
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:02,892
No honey, let it happen.

1081
01:19:05,353 --> 01:19:08,847
I made a big mistake,
by someone smarter to marry?

1082
01:19:12,519 --> 01:19:14,400
This was a wedding.

1083
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:20,499
And when I looked, I realized something
I have long forgotten.

1084
01:19:20,662 --> 01:19:26,239
you make me so very happy

1085
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:30,791
Sometimes the
life forging links ...

1086
01:19:30,987 --> 01:19:32,486
which can never be broken.

1087
01:19:33,172 --> 01:19:40,288
Sometimes you can really find that person,
which, whatever, to your side.

1088
01:19:41,172 --> 01:19:45,728
Maybe you feel that a partner,
and you'll celebrate your dream wedding.

1089
01:19:46,474 --> 01:19:50,261
But there is also the opportunity
that the person ...

1090
01:19:50,362 --> 01:19:51,588
life you can count ...

1091
01:19:53,326 --> 01:19:58,752
That person you better
familiar than you know yourself ...

1092
01:19:58,853 --> 01:20:03,416
same person to you
side, quite the time.

1093
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:09,580
One year later.

1094
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:18,329
You look great.
- You look great.

1095
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,211
How was the holiday?
- It was amazing.

1096
01:20:22,512 --> 01:20:24,410
I would like everything about this.
Actually not.

1097
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:26,435
Really, you married my brother.
That is strange.

1098
01:20:26,536 --> 01:20:28,585
So I would never know.

1099
01:20:29,436 --> 01:20:32,241
Shall we toast?
On the marriage?

1100
01:20:32,342 --> 01:20:34,738
I do not drink.

1101
01:20:37,334 --> 01:20:39,022
Me neither.

1102
01:20:41,326 --> 01:20:43,731
Are you pregnant?
- Are you pregnant?

1103
01:20:43,732 --> 01:20:45,972
Where ...?

1104
01:20:45,973 --> 01:20:47,880
