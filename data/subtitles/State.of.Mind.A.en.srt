1
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:33,393
North Korea is the least visited
North Korea is the least known

2
00:00:33,764 --> 00:00:37,530
North Korea is the least understood...

3
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:41,970
...country in the world.
It is home to the Mass Games...

4
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:46,275
...the largest choreographed spectacle
in the world.

5
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:59,754
I long for the day
when I perform for the General...

6
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:01,882
...so I train through the pain.

7
00:01:16,073 --> 00:01:19,804
To strengthen my resolve to do well
in gymnastics and school...

8
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:23,335
...I study with a picture of the
Great Leader and the General.

9
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:41,430
In 2003, a British documentary
crew followed

10
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:46,061
two North Korean schoolgirls, as they
prepared for that year's Mass Games.

11
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:54,636
Mass Games are North Korea's
socialist realism extravaganza

12
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:57,880
and a perfect example of the
state's ideology:

13
00:01:58,148 --> 00:02:02,482
the subordination of the individual's
desires to the needs of the collective.

14
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:12,827
Throughout the year, North Korea was
the focus of negative world attention

15
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:16,028
as its nuclear policy
was condemned worldwide.

16
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:21,301
At a time when North Korea's distrust of
the outside world was at its highest,

17
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:25,635
the film crew was granted unparalleled
co-operation from the authorities.

18
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:34,183
There were guides and interpreters
present at all times,

19
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:37,684
but they neither interfered nor sought to
censor the material.

20
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,961
For the first time ever, North Korea,

21
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:49,725
the secret state, would reveal
itself to outsiders.

22
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:04,180
A State of Mind

23
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,759
Pyongyang, North Korea's capital.

24
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:33,569
A harsh winter is almost at an end,

25
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:36,844
but it is February and
minus eight degrees.

26
00:03:44,722 --> 00:03:46,849
As there is negligible
indoor heating here,

27
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,158
the children of Pyongyang
remain on winter holiday.

28
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:59,063
Kim Il Sung Stadium

29
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:03,641
But for an elite group of gymnasts
there is no time for play,

30
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,269
only for training.

31
00:04:07,778 --> 00:04:09,040
Hands up if you can do it like her.

32
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:12,711
It's a club where my classmates and I...

33
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:16,412
...perform group gymnastics together
with our hearts in unison.

34
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:24,685
The Mass Games club trains daily
for a minimum of two hours.

35
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:37,430
<i>Pak Hyon Sun</i>
The temperature can be as low as
20 degrees centigrade...

36
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:42,001
...whilst we train at the athletic
academy for young people.

37
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,047
You look prettier as you smile.

38
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:58,027
Pak Hyon Sun is 13 years old.

39
00:04:58,028 --> 00:05:01,628
She has been a member of the
Mass Games club for four years.

40
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:09,930
When I train, I sometimes fall
over and hurt my knees.

41
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,498
So it hurts in a lot of places...

42
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:17,070
...but I long for the day when I
perform for the General...

43
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:19,308
...so I train through the pain.

44
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:27,612
It's tough!

45
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:35,060
Scenes of collective training can be
found all over Pyongyang.

46
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,500
Each Mass Games unit is striving to
attain the state's desire

47
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:41,905
to cultivate the group mentality.

48
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:52,748
Since the formation of The Democratic
People's Republic of Korea in 1948,

49
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:55,078
the State has imposed

50
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,179
an all encompassing
belief structure on the people.

51
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:08,394
The placement of Mass Games
within this structure

52
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:09,495
has never been more significant.

53
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:15,935
For the participants it enforces
submission to the group.

54
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:21,667
For the audience it is an inspiration to
behold the values of teamwork

55
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:24,436
and the glory of the
State and the Leader.

56
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:33,184
In the West, North Korea is condemned
as a repressive and totalitarian state.

57
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:37,093
Yet here,
the high level of discipline is imposed

58
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:38,894
by the perceived threat
from the outside world.

59
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:43,895
They see it as their struggle to build a
strong country under its own principles.

60
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:47,893
Everything centers around the worship
of the Great Leader, Kim Il Sung,

61
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:53,135
who died in 1994, and his son and
successor Kim Jong Il, the General.

62
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,268
Before appearing in front of the General...

63
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:59,782
...my chest and heart were trembling.

64
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,183
My whole body was trembling.

65
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:05,346
I was so frightened that I couldn't move

66
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,013
any part of my body...

67
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,024
...but when I thought that I would go out...

68
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:10,787
...in front of the General and do my moves...

69
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:13,921
...it seemed as if the General
was looking at me...

70
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:16,989
...and saying "Don't cry, do your best."

71
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:24,098
My heart felt happy and I broke into a smile.

72
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,473
For these girls, the Mass Games are an
obsession that governs their life.

73
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:35,017
Their driving force is to be good enough
to be selected for the final performance,

74
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:36,218
which will be viewed by the General.

75
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:40,653
Hyon Sun has experienced Mass Games
in the presence of the General

76
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:41,654
on three occasions.

77
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:04,103
I have never been happier than the 3 times...

78
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:07,014
...I performed in the presence of the General.

79
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:11,579
When I appeared before the General
for the third and final time...

80
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:16,524
...I kept thinking, I really mustn't
make a mistake.

81
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:42,343
At first, Mass Games was exhausting...

82
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:48,551
...so I went out everyday and played instead,

83
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:52,823
Then I'd return home in the evening...

84
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:57,192
...and tell my mother that I'd been to gym.

85
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:08,076
I got found out by my mother and teacher.

86
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:10,136
So I got a good telling off.

87
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:13,740
After that I started going to gym practice.

88
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:37,868
Yes, my friends also wanted to come out
with us and try being filmed.

89
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:45,981
Hello. This is my grandfather.

90
00:09:48,952 --> 00:09:50,510
This is my Grandmother.

91
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:55,087
This is my Mother.

92
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:02,493
Today is the day when our father
the General, was born.

93
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:07,594
So our family - my mother, father and
grandfather has come out...

94
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:17,304
...to the Taedong River, where we're
enjoying ourselves.

95
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:30,350
Hyon Sun's father came with us too...

96
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,793
...but something came up
at work so he had to go...

97
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:34,831
...but he'll join us again soon.

98
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,561
In Korea, the family
is the strongest unit,

99
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:42,799
yet nothing transcends the passion
and devotion shown for the leaders.

100
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:47,407
To celebrate February 16th,
the General's birthday,

101
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:49,708
everyone in North Korea
is granted a day's holiday.

102
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,608
The mood around Pyongyang is relaxed.
For Hyon Sun, this is a day of rest.

103
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,254
Today is the happiest of
all days and festival...

104
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:01,222
...because it's the day when our General...

105
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,226
...to whom the whole world looks up, was born.

106
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:08,129
So the citizens of Pyongyang... the youngsters,

107
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:09,756
will go dancing tonight.

108
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,303
Won't you join in?

109
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:28,014
Hyon Sun's group is training for
the next Mass Games,

110
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,815
which are due to be held in July,

111
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,522
to commemorate the 50th anniversary
of the end of the Korean War,

112
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:37,023
a war known in the West
as the Forgotten War -

113
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:41,629
in North Korea as the Victorious
Fatherland Liberation War.

114
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:50,261
Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum

115
00:11:57,013 --> 00:11:59,675
Grandfather, is that a fighter plane from
the U.S. Army of aggressors?

116
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,012
Did it drop bombs too?

117
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:07,819
No, but it dropped all kinds of insects...

118
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:15,195
...containing the virus of various plagues

119
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,326
before being shot down.

120
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:24,398
An estimated four million people,
many of them civilians,

121
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:28,740
were killed in the three year war and
to this day Korea has remained divided.

122
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,648
The near flattening of the north by
American bombers

123
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,411
has left a deep mark on North
Korean psyche.

124
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:38,846
When I was young...

125
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:44,320
...I didn't know if the U.S.

126
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:45,884
Imperialists were bad or good.

127
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,954
But through our war in the 1950's...

128
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:53,862
...I saw the brutal bombing of our country...

129
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:57,301
...and the atrocities suffered by our people.

130
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:05,240
I saw things being done that

131
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:09,750
no human could do.

132
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:13,152
I became more enraged
about U.S. Imperialism...

133
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:19,560
...and felt that we had to rid this land
of U.S. Imperialism completely.

134
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:34,773
Hatred of the US is immortalized
in Mass Games

135
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:37,408
and is ingrained in everyday life.

136
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:49,321
The U.S. are making life bad in our country...

137
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,657
...they are maneuvering to suppress
the sound of happy laughter here.

138
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:03,803
As war looms in Iraq, America openly
talks of a war on two fronts,

139
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:06,808
implying Iraq and North Korea.

140
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:12,014
Pyongyang is just over 100 miles
from the 37,000 US troops

141
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:13,515
based in South Korea.

142
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:19,457
Hyon Sun's daily life is
disrupted by preparations

143
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,258
for an American attack on the city.

144
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:34,631
At home, I was having fun playing with my

145
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,228
mother and grandmother...

146
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:39,298
...then there would be a blackout or an
air-raid practice.

147
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:40,866
On their way down to the air-raid shelter...

148
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:43,037
...the mothers and grandmothers say:

149
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:45,775
"This is all because of the Americans."

150
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:51,650
Because we're always doing
things like air raids and blackout...

151
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:57,552
...I think, just as we're taught at school...

152
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:01,894
...we have to endlessly hate the U.S. And
fight them to the end.

153
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:11,266
The General's Family

154
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:17,614
Officially, North Korea is
divided into three classes:

155
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:19,715
the workers, the peasants
and the intellectuals,

156
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:22,683
who are seen as equals in society.

157
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:26,519
Mum, water please.

158
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:30,490
Yes, use this cup.

159
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:33,895
Hyon Sun's family is from
the workers class.

160
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:37,625
Her father is a driver for
a government ministry;

161
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:39,326
her grandfather is
a construction worker.

162
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:41,734
Mother and grandmother are housewives.

163
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:46,305
Mum, I have to pack my lunch box.

164
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:49,745
Lunch? OK, let's pack it.

165
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:51,610
Take the box out from there.

166
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:52,875
This one, here?

167
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:56,578
Housing is allocated by the State.

168
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,357
Pyongyang is not representative of
North Korea; it is the showcase capital.

169
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:05,521
For its two million residents, it's
considered a privilege to live here.

170
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:09,961
Is it not ready yet?

171
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,527
She's spooning out the rice now.

172
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,766
State radio is piped to
every kitchen in the block.

173
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:23,045
Listeners can turn the
volume down, but not off.

174
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:35,353
The apartment has two bedrooms:
one for Hyon Sun, one for her parents.

175
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:38,889
Her Grandparents sleep on the floor
where the family is eating.

176
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:43,896
Hyon Sun's television is a gift
from the State -

177
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:47,833
a reward for her performance in the
Mass Games of 2002.

178
00:16:48,004 --> 00:16:51,405
There is only one channel.
It broadcasts propaganda news,

179
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:55,142
films and entertainment for
five hours per day.

180
00:16:57,447 --> 00:17:01,349
We have so many heroes in this country...

181
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:06,220
...it's impossible to count them.

182
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:12,661
Especially the athlete Jung Song Ok,
who glorified our country.

183
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:17,495
I want to do well in rhythmic
gymnastics and become like her.

184
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:20,460
I will definitely make
it happen in the future.

185
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:38,719
We prepare Mass Games every time
there's a national holiday in our country.

186
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:44,084
So at the time of our Great Leader
comrade Kim Il Sung's birthday...

187
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:48,029
and the anniversary of the founding of

188
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,930
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea...

189
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,225
...or the anniversary of the founding
of the Korean Workers' Party...

190
00:17:53,303 --> 00:17:54,270
...those times.

191
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:34,609
Mass Games have been performed
in North Korea since 1946.

192
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:38,175
The next Mass Games
will be the 120th.

193
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:39,804
Kim Jong Ho
Mass Games Organizer

194
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:46,219
Mass Games consists of three elements:

195
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:49,291
Firstly, gymnastics...

196
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,224
...then backdrop...

197
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:52,454
...finally music.

198
00:18:53,196 --> 00:18:58,065
Gymnastics is the fundamental element.

199
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:10,668
Up to 80,000 gymnasts are
used in the floor display.

200
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:24,090
The participants know that the slightest
individual mistake on their part

201
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,591
could damage the group's performance.

202
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:32,798
They therefore surrender to the group
and in this way the performers become

203
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:36,999
ideologically prepared, thus
becoming true Communists.

204
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:46,716
The backdrop of the Mass Games,

205
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:49,017
which details North Korea's achievements

206
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:51,018
and the country's revolutionary history

207
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,353
is a huge mosaic, covering a whole
side of the stadium.

208
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:02,264
The Korean's declare it to be
the biggest picture in the world.

209
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:10,570
Images of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il
must be portrayed with total devotion.

210
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:23,081
The backdrop works according to signals
from the backdrop conductor

211
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:24,982
who is placed on
the opposite side of the stadium.

212
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:31,687
Up to 12,000
schoolchildren are used.

213
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:35,827
Each school practices daily until
perfection is achieved.

214
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:04,454
Performed in 2002, Arirang was the
most stunning of all Mass Games.

215
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:08,030
Almost 200 million
man hours

216
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,531
were spent
preparing and performing the show.

217
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:45,026
In all, the 90 performances over a
four-month period

218
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:48,027
were viewed live by four
million people.

219
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:27,069
Workers' Siren
7am

220
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:30,344
Song Yon, Song Yon...

221
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:34,171
...wake up and go to school.

222
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:35,579
It's high time.

223
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,911
Song Yon, quickly!

224
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:42,481
Hey, Song Yon! School! Time! Be quick!

225
00:22:45,394 --> 00:22:46,088
Time!

226
00:23:04,981 --> 00:23:06,471
Kim Song Yon

227
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,577
Please hurry up, you're going
to be late for school.

228
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:20,458
Kim Song Yon is eleven years old and
has performed in two Mass Games.

229
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:23,891
Her family is from the Intellectual Class.

230
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,595
Her father is a Physics Lecturer at
Kim Il Sung University.

231
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:30,367
Her mother is a housewife.

232
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,071
She has two older sisters: one is
fifteen and a high school student;

233
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:43,882
the eldest is 18, a high school graduate
who will shortly be joining the Army.

234
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:52,555
Song Yon's sisters have a room each;
her parents sleep on the lounge floor.

235
00:23:52,995 --> 00:23:56,658
Song Yon sleeps in a different sister's
room each night.

236
00:23:58,267 --> 00:23:58,995
Song Yon!

237
00:23:59,068 --> 00:23:59,591
Yes?

238
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:00,931
Come here.

239
00:24:01,003 --> 00:24:01,799
What's up?

240
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:02,701
Come here quickly!

241
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:04,096
Come quickly.

242
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:06,365
Why did you eat so little?

243
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:11,638
Because I didn't want to eat...

244
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:14,415
You should eat a lot and try to
make your body strong.

245
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:17,646
You shouldn't eat little, should you?

246
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:20,487
I'll eat a lot from tomorrow.

247
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:22,046
Eat more, yes?

248
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:44,271
Have you packed my gym uniform?

249
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:45,109
Yes.

250
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,144
I'm going.

251
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,312
Did you put a spoon in for my lunch?

252
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:54,481
Yes.

253
00:24:57,994 --> 00:25:00,963
Hyon Sun is the best gymnast for
her age and discipline.

254
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:05,460
As group leader, she is expected to
help improve the skills of others.

255
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:11,139
When I first joined the Mass Games club...

256
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:14,404
...and looked at the children
practicing their movements...

257
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:17,469
...I thought Song Yon's techniques
weren't so good.

258
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:20,777
So I helped her improve techniques a bit...

259
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,081
...and taught her movements one by one.

260
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,178
After that, since we lived near each other...

261
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:28,713
...we hung around together...

262
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:31,382
...and taught movements and played together.

263
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,156
Isn't spinning around coming at the end?

264
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,322
Two turns!

265
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:36,194
After doing like this...

266
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:36,959
Two turns!

267
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:37,965
And after doing that?

268
00:25:38,034 --> 00:25:39,566
After doing this...

269
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:44,165
Hyon Sun performed better than me...

270
00:25:44,774 --> 00:25:47,470
...and she could do more skilful moves.

271
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:49,101
So I learned them from her

272
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:51,646
and got used to those movements.

273
00:25:52,248 --> 00:25:56,651
Since we both loved Mass Games,
we got on well.

274
00:25:57,186 --> 00:25:59,154
Since then, we have become closer.

275
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:03,256
When I come home from school...

276
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:06,554
...I have no one to play with and it's boring.

277
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:08,961
Once I went to Song Yon's house.

278
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:12,228
Her two elder sisters were there...

279
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:13,768
...and Song Yon was there too.

280
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:17,966
So we played the accordion, the guitar
and the violin together.

281
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,945
Afterwards, I went home and there
was no-one there.

282
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:25,002
It was really quiet.

283
00:26:25,815 --> 00:26:27,476
I hate being at our house.

284
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,211
I wish I had lots of brothers and sisters.

285
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:53,667
When I was young, I hated life in
groups and organizations...

286
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:54,971
...so I would run away.

287
00:27:02,418 --> 00:27:04,409
From the time I went up to middle school...

288
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:07,047
I started going to school in the mornings...

289
00:27:07,123 --> 00:27:09,523
...and to club in the afternoons.

290
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,573
There were many girls at the club
much older than me.

291
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:29,099
The older girls would insult us
whenever they were in charge.

292
00:27:29,178 --> 00:27:33,740
They'd say we weren't good enough.

293
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:36,011
My only thoughts were to keep running away.

294
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:08,812
I developed my skills and got put
on the list of names...

295
00:28:08,884 --> 00:28:10,875
...for the Mass Games event.

296
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:14,889
This time we will do 'lifting-one
leg after turning'.

297
00:28:14,957 --> 00:28:17,084
You have to hold up your body strongly...

298
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,184
...with the strength of your other leg...

299
00:28:19,261 --> 00:28:21,729
...and stretch onto tiptoes.

300
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:31,332
Arms up.

301
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:34,433
You have to keep your arms straight.

302
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,808
But at the moment the arms of you
who play on the top all go like this.

303
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,378
Make this pose straight and next...

304
00:28:39,448 --> 00:28:43,885
OK, next the eye-lines when
you lift your heads.

305
00:28:43,953 --> 00:28:44,715
Turn around.

306
00:28:44,787 --> 00:28:46,618
After you turn around, head-kicking, here.

307
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:49,220
You're not doing this pose properly.

308
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:52,021
Those who play on the top, watch
how to put your legs together.

309
00:28:53,162 --> 00:28:54,322
Watch!

310
00:28:56,132 --> 00:28:58,623
You should put them together strongly.

311
00:28:58,701 --> 00:29:01,295
The same applies when you
put them apart. This is it.

312
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:20,049
Now, say "Ya!"

313
00:29:28,364 --> 00:29:31,231
Group gymnastics is not an
exercise done by one person...

314
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,632
...but by a synchronized group.

315
00:29:33,702 --> 00:29:35,101
Even though it's tiring...

316
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:36,661
...because you do it together
with classmates...

317
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:43,641
...group power develops and
individualism completely disappears.

318
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:51,347
There are a lot of moves

319
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:54,416
I would rather not do.

320
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,056
There's one where I
have to throw the ball...

321
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:58,157
...and then hold it between my legs.

322
00:29:58,194 --> 00:29:58,990
Look, try this one.

323
00:30:00,763 --> 00:30:03,493
If you make a mistake at first, then try again.

324
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:07,326
That one doesn't really work,
so I often think.

325
00:30:07,403 --> 00:30:10,270
It would be really good if I didn't
have to do that one.

326
00:30:10,773 --> 00:30:15,307
Don't grab it by hands - when it comes
here, then put it between your legs.

327
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:18,074
Stretch out your legs and hold it.

328
00:30:19,014 --> 00:30:19,639
That's right.

329
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:21,273
See if you can do it.

330
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,339
Don't worry about mistakes.

331
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,386
Try it.

332
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:31,591
Try to copy her.

333
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:36,760
Well done.

334
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:45,304
Well done, you're good at this.

335
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:50,070
Would Jong Shim come out and sing?

336
00:30:53,148 --> 00:30:54,240
Applause!

337
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:56,751
Hurray! Goody good!

338
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:20,400
Let's hold hands all together
and sing a song.

339
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:26,106
<i>Leading shining North Korea to victory...

340
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:29,082
<i>...brightening the future of communism...

341
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:34,987
<i>...the beloved comrade Kim Jong Il.

342
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:40,757
<i>Glory, glory, Kim Jong Il our
excellent Leader.

343
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:46,665
<i>Glory, glory, Kim Jong Il our
excellent Leader.

344
00:31:52,066 --> 00:31:54,066
More!

345
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:02,547
Much of April is spent preparing to
celebrate Kim Il Sung's birthday.

346
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:05,645
The 2 day holiday
will begin on the 15th.

347
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:09,491
The years following Kim Il Sung's death

348
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:11,892
coincided with a great
degree of hardship in North Korea,

349
00:32:12,328 --> 00:32:15,525
a period that has become known
as the arduous march.

350
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:22,401
When we talk of times of hardship...

351
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:29,244
...the first thing we think of is
the Arduous March.

352
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:37,514
No one will ever know the true number
of deaths from starvation during this time

353
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:40,755
and even in Pyongyang there was no
escape from the misery.

354
00:32:41,423 --> 00:32:45,883
Most analysts predicted an implosion
of the country and the system.

355
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:51,728
In the West, the continued food crisis is
blamed on the State's isolation policy

356
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,368
and its outdated agricultural system.

357
00:32:54,837 --> 00:32:58,074
In North Korea, it is seen as
a period of struggle,

358
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:00,075
but one the people have to accept

359
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:04,705
in order to continue the State's policy
of self-reliance and independence.

360
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:10,749
Song Yon's mother was the
first North Korean citizen

361
00:33:10,853 --> 00:33:14,584
to speak to a foreigner on the record
about the arduous march.

362
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:22,587
When we say "difficult" we mean
that we had grown up...

363
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:25,166
...with the benevolence of the state...

364
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:27,259
...without worries about housing
food or clothing.

365
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:30,872
Suddenly, due to situations such as
the imperialists' economic blockades...

366
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:32,770
...abnormal climatic phenomena and the

367
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:37,335
farming going wrong...

368
00:33:37,413 --> 00:33:40,576
...there were problems with food rations.

369
00:33:41,483 --> 00:33:44,941
To let you know how bad we felt then...

370
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,716
...I only need tell you about
our eldest daughter's

371
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,655
birthday at the time.

372
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,154
On Song Mi's birthday we
had nothing but maize.

373
00:33:56,231 --> 00:34:01,191
So I ground the cobs of maize and
made porridge with it.

374
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,465
We celebrated our eldest
daughter's birthday...

375
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,099
...by giving half a bowl of

376
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:09,734
porridge to the other children...

377
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:12,212
...and a whole bowl to the birthday girl.

378
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:17,644
To mark April 15th,
rations are increased.

379
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:19,645
Normally, the citizens of Pyongyang

380
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:24,124
are entitled to one chicken and five
eggs per person per month.

381
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:27,996
Although the food situation has greatly
improved in Pyongyang,

382
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:33,063
it is still a precarious
situation for most civilians

383
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:35,264
with much of the population reliant on
foreign aid.

384
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:40,737
Malnutrition is now the biggest threat to
the next generation of North Koreans.

385
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:45,146
You can't say that our life is

386
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:47,273
abundant at the moment.

387
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:52,180
But it's considerably better than
during the Arduous March.

388
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:57,519
Moran Bong Middle School Number One

389
00:34:58,427 --> 00:35:01,161
The performance is three months away

390
00:35:01,162 --> 00:35:04,162
and the intensive daily training
is taking its toll on the girls.

391
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:08,059
They have overslept and
are late for roll call.

392
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:26,552
We will guard the Great Leader,
General Kim Jong Il...

393
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,452
...to the death.

394
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:36,129
We will stand together as one...

395
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,764
...no matter how adverse
the circumstances...

396
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,530
...and keep to our own style of socialism...

397
00:35:47,276 --> 00:35:49,938
I now bring to an end this gathering
to give an oath of loyalty...

398
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:53,306
...to the Great Leader, General Kim Jong Il.

399
00:35:55,183 --> 00:35:56,810
We will start marching.

400
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,214
Go forward!

401
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:11,121
"Long Live Generalissimo Kim Jong Il!"

402
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,873
Song Yon's English Lesson

403
00:37:01,116 --> 00:37:03,448
Song Yon's English Teacher

404
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:12,492
Song-yeon is a good student
but not very good at studying.

405
00:37:13,128 --> 00:37:19,226
She cannot spend as much time
in studying as other students

406
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:24,571
because she has to spare a big amount
of time for practicing gymnastics.

407
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:30,775
Her score at school is not one of the best
but not one of the worst, either.

408
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:34,648
Hello everybody.

409
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:37,218
Everyone of us has
something to do in the future.

410
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:39,753
Most of us will join the
Korean Peoples Army.

411
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:03,735
Let's join the campaign to acquire
the name 'Honorary Red Flag.'

412
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,275
Hyon Sun's Revolutionary History Lesson

413
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:13,616
How many types of greatness does
the Great Leader have?

414
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:16,050
Three: Firstly?

415
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,682
Greatness in ideology.

416
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:18,748
Second?

417
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:20,055
Greatness in leadership.

418
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:20,992
Third?

419
00:38:21,063 --> 00:38:22,860
Greatness in aura.

420
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,159
So we recognize three aspects to the
Great Leader's greatness.

421
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:32,704
Where are the U.S. Imperialist aggressors

422
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:33,639
attacking at the moment?

423
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,176
Iraq.

424
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:36,972
Looking at the state of affairs in the
world at the moment...

425
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:40,572
...it's clear that the U.S. Imperialists...

426
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:43,914
...cannot rest even for a moment from
invading other countries.

427
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,711
Furthermore, our revolution
is progressing...

428
00:38:46,788 --> 00:38:49,586
...in such difficult circumstances today.

429
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:52,150
With the intention of getting rid of
our Korean socialism...

430
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:54,525
...the only socialism left on this Earth...

431
00:38:55,263 --> 00:38:58,232
...these Americans are
maneuvering to isolate...

432
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,268
...squash and suffocate our country.

433
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:03,094
What do they want to do to
socialism in the end?

434
00:39:03,538 --> 00:39:04,402
They want to totally demolish it.

435
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,835
When we receive the Great
Leader's leadership...

436
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:10,639
...we are destined to be eternally happy.

437
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:07,863
After a two hour lunch break
it's time for training.

438
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:17,541
My legs hurt.

439
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:23,647
The schedule is intensifying.

440
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:31,352
If they are to make the final performance

441
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:34,853
in the presence of The General, the
group must reach the standard required.

442
00:40:44,272 --> 00:40:48,106
Previous experience of Mass Games
is no guarantee of selection.

443
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:11,662
Granddad, I'm back.

444
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,793
By the time Hyon Sun arrives home from
training, it's seven in the evening,

445
00:41:16,037 --> 00:41:18,767
six hours after school has finished.

446
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:22,627
Grandma, I'm back.

447
00:41:22,662 --> 00:41:24,178
Mum, I'm back.

448
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:24,769
Home already?

449
00:41:24,846 --> 00:41:25,471
Yes.

450
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:32,053
Whenever I go home my grandmother
tells me to do homework or study.

451
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:36,153
So when I come home from school...

452
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:38,715
...I stay out of grandmother's
sight and go out to play.

453
00:41:49,938 --> 00:41:54,773
My grandmother is quite strict
about what I should do or not.

454
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,541
Because I can't get my own way
with her, I get upset.

455
00:42:04,753 --> 00:42:05,583
Here.

456
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:08,517
Hey, you're making me feed you.

457
00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:13,920
Of course, because she's my
Granddaughter she's quite cute...

458
00:42:13,995 --> 00:42:17,761
...and I won't scold her or hit her
as I did to my own child.

459
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,201
But when it comes to cultivating
her group mentality...

460
00:42:23,738 --> 00:42:25,035
...and strengthening her will, we are strict.

461
00:42:25,774 --> 00:42:27,071
Put it on your knees.

462
00:42:31,913 --> 00:42:34,279
How is a gymnast like her so weak?

463
00:42:39,187 --> 00:42:41,121
I sometimes raise my voice to her...

464
00:42:42,023 --> 00:42:47,222
...and I'm strict when she gets lazy.

465
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:52,028
You start dancing first and
I'll play accordingly.

466
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:04,835
My mother does everything I ask her.

467
00:43:04,913 --> 00:43:06,642
She listens to everything I say.

468
00:43:07,582 --> 00:43:11,951
She's closer and more affectionate
with me than with anyone else.

469
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,954
She's like one of my classmates.

470
00:43:17,892 --> 00:43:18,654
As a mother, I feel proud...

471
00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:21,693
...of the way I have brought up my daughter.

472
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:32,805
Did you dance in that cardigan?

473
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:35,108
With her father, she finds
things a bit difficult.

474
00:43:36,011 --> 00:43:38,275
So no matter how strictly her father...

475
00:43:38,346 --> 00:43:39,677
...and her grandmother bring her up...

476
00:43:39,748 --> 00:43:42,740
...as her mother I have maternal love...

477
00:43:42,817 --> 00:43:45,115
...so I pamper her quite a lot.

478
00:43:53,094 --> 00:43:58,691
Sometimes she lies to her father and
only tells me things in secret.

479
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:03,830
I sometimes hide things from her father...

480
00:44:03,905 --> 00:44:06,999
...if I think she'll get in trouble for them.

481
00:44:24,492 --> 00:44:25,754
Will you take out the soup
bowls for me?

482
00:44:25,827 --> 00:44:26,691
Soup bowls?

483
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:31,262
Oh, why do we have this power cut?

484
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:34,733
Use this lighter.

485
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:40,635
We get used to it.

486
00:44:48,783 --> 00:44:51,579
Even in the central district of Pyongyang,

487
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,380
the most important area of the city,

488
00:44:53,688 --> 00:44:58,022
most nights are spent without electricity
at some point in the evening.

489
00:45:08,636 --> 00:45:09,864
Bloody Americans!

490
00:45:11,706 --> 00:45:12,638
It's all their fault.

491
00:45:20,815 --> 00:45:24,080
It's Sunday, the official
day of rest in Pyongyang.

492
00:45:35,864 --> 00:45:37,525
After their picnic,

493
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,926
Song Yon and her family plan to
visit the flower exhibition,

494
00:45:40,268 --> 00:45:44,273
which is devoted exclusively to
two breeds of flower:

495
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,674
the Kim Il Sungia
and the Kim Jong Ilia.

496
00:45:50,044 --> 00:45:58,144
Since Song Yon really wanted to,
we went boating.

497
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:03,950
Our eldest and second daughters
said they would do it...

498
00:46:04,025 --> 00:46:05,959
...but in fact when they started...

499
00:46:06,027 --> 00:46:08,086
...we saw that they didn't know how to row.

500
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:14,668
Song Yon teased them from behind.

501
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,074
Follow us.

502
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,646
Whatever you say, language
and cultures are different.

503
00:46:27,649 --> 00:46:31,380
I wonder what makes
people happy or angry.

504
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:35,081
These sorts of feelings, especially
the kind of international news...

505
00:46:35,156 --> 00:46:36,817
...that has been showing here on TV recently.

506
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:41,461
We used to not know what this means.

507
00:46:42,564 --> 00:46:47,797
But now people have got to know
that it's a symbol of justice.

508
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:55,471
Through this kind of process we get
to understand the world.

509
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:21,859
I want to know the current

510
00:47:21,936 --> 00:47:23,267
situation in Iraq...

511
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:28,407
...because we think the situation in Iraq...

512
00:47:28,977 --> 00:47:32,208
...could have a direct effect
on the situation in our

513
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,011
country in the future.

514
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:40,177
People are very interested
in the state of affairs in Iraq.

515
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:42,853
I'd like to know about it, but

516
00:47:44,058 --> 00:47:46,117
since I've been busy recently...

517
00:47:47,595 --> 00:47:49,862
...I haven't been able to give time to that.

518
00:47:51,165 --> 00:47:54,293
Baghdad has fallen to the Americans
four days earlier

519
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:57,736
but there has been no official reporting
of this in the state media.

520
00:48:00,975 --> 00:48:10,611
I'm a bit sad I've no son I can
send to the People's Army...

521
00:48:11,352 --> 00:48:14,753
...who I can join hands with
to achieve Reunification.

522
00:48:15,823 --> 00:48:17,586
Since my occupation belongs
to an intellectual class...

523
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:19,625
...since I work in science,

524
00:48:20,928 --> 00:48:22,589
I like it when things are quiet.

525
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:24,928
When you come into this
house it's not like that.

526
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,469
Since our children are girls,
they talk a lot.

527
00:48:33,574 --> 00:48:36,737
Mum, this has torn off during training.

528
00:48:38,613 --> 00:48:43,243
While you study with your dad,
I will sew it up.

529
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:48,151
Dad, my teacher told me to

530
00:48:48,222 --> 00:48:49,746
make a homework book...

531
00:48:49,824 --> 00:48:51,257
...so I have to use a new homework book.

532
00:48:51,326 --> 00:48:52,953
I have to do this English

533
00:48:53,027 --> 00:48:53,789
vocabulary and grammar.

534
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:55,089
English?

535
00:48:55,163 --> 00:48:56,790
Yes, English grammar.

536
00:48:57,832 --> 00:48:59,094
Dad doesn't know English.

537
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:04,697
- Why don't we leave English and...
- Forget English.

538
00:49:04,772 --> 00:49:08,606
Homework, homework, homework book...

539
00:49:14,982 --> 00:49:15,914
Wow, looks pretty.

540
00:49:16,484 --> 00:49:18,008
Looks exactly the same as Song Yon.

541
00:49:18,086 --> 00:49:21,021
Kim Song Yon, Kim Song Mi.

542
00:49:21,923 --> 00:49:22,617
This is you.

543
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:23,850
You...

544
00:49:25,893 --> 00:49:26,882
The photograph is so old...

545
00:49:28,262 --> 00:49:31,561
Hey, hey, hey, when it comes
to photos, the older, the better.

546
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,799
There's no-one good looking in your class!

547
00:49:36,871 --> 00:49:42,707
Doesn't she look like an actress,
the one in 'A Kind Girl'?

548
00:49:42,777 --> 00:49:44,301
No, not a single bit.

549
00:49:45,713 --> 00:49:51,845
I'm not sad about only having daughters.

550
00:49:51,919 --> 00:49:54,683
We're bringing up our daughters well.

551
00:49:55,323 --> 00:49:57,018
She's joining the People's Army...

552
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:00,885
...with her Taekwondo skill.

553
00:50:01,529 --> 00:50:04,020
She's joining the army, doing her
own work - she will make me proud.

554
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:08,326
Let's say our second daughter
has a quiet personality.

555
00:50:08,403 --> 00:50:10,166
She knows nothing but study.

556
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:12,206
So we're training her as a scientist.

557
00:50:13,341 --> 00:50:14,831
Our last daughter...

558
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:19,473
...since she's quite artistic, does dancing.

559
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:23,277
Are you watching the children's movie?

560
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:26,514
Song Yon, homework! Homework!

561
00:50:27,355 --> 00:50:28,913
The children's movie is on,

562
00:50:30,391 --> 00:50:31,358
so let her do her homework after that.

563
00:50:33,194 --> 00:50:34,661
You should watch it after
doing your homework.

564
00:50:34,729 --> 00:50:36,458
You shouldn't just keep
watching films, should you?

565
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:39,523
I'll watch this first, after watching this...

566
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:43,767
Go, after studying...

567
00:50:46,073 --> 00:50:49,634
When a bear eats a fish as a
crab hides its eyes...

568
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,507
...how does the bear eat the fish?

569
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:52,568
Quickly.

570
00:50:52,647 --> 00:50:54,706
It means that the bear eats it quickly.

571
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,779
Your Excellency, this traitor
switched to our enemy.

572
00:50:58,386 --> 00:51:01,355
He signed on the plot
to kill Your Excellency.

573
00:51:01,422 --> 00:51:03,447
That's right.

574
00:51:03,524 --> 00:51:04,991
Arrest him immediately!

575
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:10,757
I can't get caught by them here.

576
00:51:10,832 --> 00:51:13,164
I should smash them up
and destroy them.

577
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:18,328
He will break it with his foot as he jumps.

578
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,264
He is going to jail here.

579
00:51:22,043 --> 00:51:22,873
Has she done them all?

580
00:51:25,346 --> 00:51:26,836
Put it there and watch the movie.

581
00:51:30,618 --> 00:51:31,744
What's that?

582
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:33,116
Is that art gymnastics or what?

583
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:36,579
Try more graciously.

584
00:51:37,225 --> 00:51:40,388
Focus on your hands and
try like this graciously.

585
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:42,429
Your dad does it more beautifully than you.

586
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:48,495
Raise your arm like this.

587
00:51:49,704 --> 00:51:50,728
Like this?

588
00:51:51,372 --> 00:51:52,202
Oh, that's good.

589
00:51:58,312 --> 00:51:59,939
Oi! Really...

590
00:52:03,217 --> 00:52:06,015
Mansu Hill

591
00:52:10,525 --> 00:52:13,723
Kim Il Sung's birthday is
the most important day

592
00:52:13,724 --> 00:52:15,224
in the North Korean calendar.

593
00:52:18,866 --> 00:52:23,064
Three years of national mourning
followed his death in 1994.

594
00:52:23,704 --> 00:52:27,333
In 1997 he was declared Eternal President.

595
00:52:35,383 --> 00:52:37,613
The whole country will
have a two day holiday.

596
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:41,350
For Song Yon, that means two days
off from training.

597
00:52:51,933 --> 00:52:55,767
Song Yon spends April 15th with her
parents, at a co-operative farm

598
00:52:55,903 --> 00:52:58,303
30 miles outside Pyongyang.

599
00:52:59,774 --> 00:53:03,301
Wonha-ri Co-operative Farm

600
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,614
All North Koreans require a permit to
travel outside their towns of residence.

601
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:13,883
It takes the family half
a day to make the journey.

602
00:53:19,226 --> 00:53:22,063
The farm is home to a friend of
Song Yon's father

603
00:53:22,064 --> 00:53:24,164
from their days in the
Korean People's Army.

604
00:53:38,212 --> 00:53:41,204
It has been 10 years since
the veterans last met.

605
00:53:42,516 --> 00:53:44,006
They already had lunch before they came.

606
00:53:47,288 --> 00:53:48,277
We'll just have a drink then.

607
00:53:56,764 --> 00:53:59,699
I met this man when I joined the army.

608
00:54:01,202 --> 00:54:02,430
When we were in the army

609
00:54:02,503 --> 00:54:04,232
he was always sleepy...

610
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:07,664
...so we used to call him 'sleepyhead'.

611
00:54:10,244 --> 00:54:13,907
We were in different divisions but
we slept in the same bed.

612
00:54:15,683 --> 00:54:20,382
Army life is group life and
so we slept together.

613
00:54:20,454 --> 00:54:23,014
I don't sleep much in the mornings.

614
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,854
So I had to wake him up, but

615
00:54:25,926 --> 00:54:27,484
it was a bit difficult.

616
00:54:27,561 --> 00:54:30,155
I even smacked him around
the face a few times!

617
00:54:34,035 --> 00:54:37,630
To commemorate Kim Il Sung's birthday
there is a fete in the village.

618
00:54:38,205 --> 00:54:41,697
Teams from different farm units
compete for the three prizes:

619
00:54:42,176 --> 00:54:45,304
their choice of pig, sheep or goat.

620
00:54:48,783 --> 00:54:51,946
They wouldn't fight, would they?

621
00:54:52,553 --> 00:54:55,954
I've sent both my son and
daughter to the army.

622
00:54:56,023 --> 00:55:01,427
Now my life is like a honeymoon!

623
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:05,628
I want to have another child
when I see her now.

624
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:10,334
There's no guard at the
pleasant time of night!

625
00:55:17,144 --> 00:55:21,103
It is here in the countryside, even
just 30 miles outside Pyongyang,

626
00:55:21,515 --> 00:55:24,643
that the hardships of recent years
have been felt the most.

627
00:55:57,585 --> 00:55:58,984
It's been stressful, to be honest.

628
00:55:59,653 --> 00:56:02,213
We lost the Great Leader.

629
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,022
Then we had natural disasters
on top of that.

630
00:56:11,098 --> 00:56:14,033
So the farming hasn't turned
out as it should.

631
00:56:17,638 --> 00:56:22,803
To be honest, the U.S. Imperialists
have been blockading our economy.

632
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:25,072
Relying on self reliance...

633
00:56:25,146 --> 00:56:27,876
...we did our farming by ourselves.

634
00:56:30,518 --> 00:56:32,179
We've had quite a difficult existence.

635
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:41,653
Under the care of our Party and the
General we each received food...

636
00:56:41,729 --> 00:56:45,859
...up until now.

637
00:56:54,842 --> 00:56:58,504
Throughout their adversity, North
Koreans continued to be driven

638
00:56:58,505 --> 00:57:01,305
by the country's
guiding philosophy of Juche,

639
00:57:01,749 --> 00:57:04,479
that man is responsible
for his own destiny.

640
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,546
In essence, Juche preaches self-reliance.

641
00:57:11,926 --> 00:57:15,521
Self-reliance is, in a word...

642
00:57:17,097 --> 00:57:18,496
...no matter whether or not we are
provided with assistance...

643
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:21,558
...by ourselves, with our own strength...

644
00:57:22,136 --> 00:57:25,264
...even if the state can't provide something...

645
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,874
...we make what we don't have.

646
00:57:27,942 --> 00:57:31,878
For example agricultural tools, like
hoes if the state can't provide them...

647
00:57:32,546 --> 00:57:34,377
...we have to forge them ourselves
at the blacksmiths...

648
00:57:34,448 --> 00:57:36,075
...since we have to do our farming.

649
00:57:37,785 --> 00:57:40,777
So if we have no petrol for an engine...

650
00:57:40,855 --> 00:57:42,789
...we have to see how it works and
make it work at all costs...

651
00:57:45,092 --> 00:57:46,821
...even by running it on gas.

652
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:50,423
This kind of thing is self-reliance.

653
00:57:57,238 --> 00:57:59,138
Because we're former soldiers...

654
00:58:00,574 --> 00:58:03,873
...there's no excuse for saying,
"we don't have this"...

655
00:58:04,411 --> 00:58:06,072
...or "there isn't enough of that."

656
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:11,683
I think it's in the nature of us Koreans
to totally devote ourselves...

657
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,253
...completely to carrying out

658
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:15,720
whatever task we do.

659
00:58:20,794 --> 00:58:23,763
There is no knowing when these
comrades will next meet.

660
00:58:26,267 --> 00:58:29,634
At this time, Asia is gripped
by the SARS epidemic.

661
00:58:30,237 --> 00:58:32,940
Worst affected is Beijijng,

662
00:58:32,941 --> 00:58:35,141
Pyongyang's main
point of contact with the outside world.

663
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:41,471
Even though North Korea is served by
just six international flights per week,

664
00:58:41,472 --> 00:58:43,172
the state is alarmed.

665
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:46,957
As a result of the threat
of SARS, North Korea

666
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:50,658
becomes the only country in the world
to completely seal its borders.

667
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,858
No-one knows when
North Korea will re-open.

668
00:59:06,273 --> 00:59:10,107
North Korea is the last country to
lift SARS restrictions

669
00:59:10,411 --> 00:59:13,539
even though it has had no confirmed
cases of the virus.

670
00:59:14,081 --> 00:59:17,539
It opens three weeks after the outbreak
is declared over.

671
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:22,514
Are you going to gymnastic lesson now?

672
00:59:30,864 --> 00:59:32,331
I've washed this.

673
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:34,600
Then I put it in the travel bag.

674
00:59:34,635 --> 00:59:36,926
But then, you know,
there were chocolates in the bag.

675
00:59:36,927 --> 00:59:39,027
So I got a stain from chocolates.

676
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,864
It won't come off.

677
00:59:41,675 --> 00:59:46,169
You know what? I lost my school badge.
I'll get told off by the teachers.

678
00:59:49,183 --> 00:59:50,514
I lost it.

679
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:53,178
I took it off to wash my shirt.

680
00:59:53,253 --> 00:59:56,017
Then it was gone, the Moran Bong
school badge.

681
00:59:57,224 --> 00:59:59,215
- It must have gone into a drain.
- Maybe...

682
01:00:00,461 --> 01:00:03,123
Why isn't the bus coming?
It'd better some soon.

683
01:00:08,702 --> 01:00:10,294
I've got a heat rash here
and it really hurts...

684
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:11,303
Let me have a look.

685
01:00:13,507 --> 01:00:16,067
The authorities have postponed
the July Mass Games.

686
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,004
They will be held in September,

687
01:00:18,005 --> 01:00:21,305
to commemorate 55 years
of the founding of the Republic.

688
01:00:21,715 --> 01:00:25,617
For Song Yon, there has been a major
change in the dynamics of family life.

689
01:00:27,488 --> 01:00:30,651
It's been one month since my eldest
sister went to join the army.

690
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:35,618
When my eldest sister went out to
the army she left her room to me

691
01:00:36,397 --> 01:00:41,357
and told me to leave her Taekwondo
training clothes...

692
01:00:42,169 --> 01:00:44,262
...and everything else as they were.

693
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:47,673
However, she went out to
guard the General...

694
01:00:47,741 --> 01:00:50,335
...so I will wait for her, even though I miss her.

695
01:00:51,011 --> 01:00:53,172
But it's nice to have my own room!

696
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:57,816
The schools have broken
up for the summer

697
01:00:58,185 --> 01:01:01,677
and despite the postponement there
is no respite from practice.

698
01:01:04,925 --> 01:01:08,156
Every detail of the September
performance has been finalized,

699
01:01:08,695 --> 01:01:12,290
and now it is up to each group to
hone their moves to perfection.

700
01:01:24,778 --> 01:01:26,109
Next, spring your stomach.

701
01:01:29,249 --> 01:01:31,615
Next movement. Keep the line.

702
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:38,519
For the ten weeks
prior to the performance

703
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,220
practice will be held all day,

704
01:01:40,561 --> 01:01:44,861
from eight in the morning until six in the
evening, with two hours break for lunch.

705
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:49,101
Sometimes, Mass Games training is hard.

706
01:01:49,169 --> 01:01:53,071
Other children play in the blazing sunlight.

707
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:57,577
But we train and dedicate huge energy...

708
01:01:57,644 --> 01:02:02,047
...in order to give happiness
to the dear General.

709
01:02:03,817 --> 01:02:05,045
Behind your ears like this.

710
01:02:08,956 --> 01:02:11,356
Now our moves have nearly been perfected.

711
01:02:11,425 --> 01:02:15,020
When the dear Generalissimo
comes to watch the Mass Games...

712
01:02:15,696 --> 01:02:19,291
...I will definitely perform
with perfect moves.

713
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:28,273
Pyongyang Indoor Gymnasium

714
01:02:28,308 --> 01:02:31,275
With less than two months
to go to the performance

715
01:02:31,276 --> 01:02:33,076
the girls' practice area
is relocated

716
01:02:33,547 --> 01:02:35,213
to the Pyongyang Indoor Gymnasium,

717
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:37,814
where the actual
performance will be held.

718
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,718
All the disciplines of
Mass Games will practice here.

719
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,153
Each group is driven hard to ensure they
achieve the standard required.

720
01:02:56,803 --> 01:03:00,072
Even experienced gymnasts
like Hyon Sun,

721
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:02,073
who has three
Mass Games to her credit,

722
01:03:02,074 --> 01:03:03,574
are beginning to feel the pressure.

723
01:03:05,312 --> 01:03:07,837
Since we're coming to the
time of the event...

724
01:03:08,882 --> 01:03:10,213
...it's gradually getting harder.

725
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:14,655
So I've started to hate it sometimes.

726
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,589
There is no room for sentiment.

727
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:20,221
The organizers are unhappy with
the quality of the torch girls.

728
01:03:28,335 --> 01:03:32,170
Shortly after being filmed,
these girls were informed that,

729
01:03:32,171 --> 01:03:36,471
having failed to reach the standard,
they would be replaced by boys.

730
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:59,093
The postponement of the Mass Games

731
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:02,294
presents Hyon Sun and Song Yon with a
chance of a life-changing experience -

732
01:04:02,703 --> 01:04:06,696
a trip to Mount Paekdu, a 31 hour
train ride from Pyongyang.

733
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:18,083
The girls are accompanied by
a revolutionary history teacher

734
01:04:18,084 --> 01:04:19,584
from their school.

735
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:28,958
Our school selected a group of
excellent students who study hard...

736
01:04:29,663 --> 01:04:31,062
...and took them to Mount Paekdu.

737
01:04:31,732 --> 01:04:36,601
I had the honor of being selected
along with Song Yon...

738
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,865
...and other friends, and came
to Mount Paekdu.

739
01:04:40,974 --> 01:04:45,206
Mount Paekdu is considered holy to all
Koreans, both North and South.

740
01:04:45,912 --> 01:04:47,507
In legend,

741
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:51,408
the Korean nation was born out of
Mount Paekdu's volcanic Lake Chon.

742
01:05:06,566 --> 01:05:10,093
Our people all have great
respect for Mount Paekdu.

743
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:25,045
As Mount Paekdu is the place
where the beloved Great Leader...

744
01:05:25,686 --> 01:05:27,176
...Kim Il Sung carried out

745
01:05:27,254 --> 01:05:28,653
the anti-Japanese armed struggle...

746
01:05:28,722 --> 01:05:30,587
...and where the General
Kim Jong Il was born.

747
01:05:30,657 --> 01:05:35,060
So we Koreans all admire it as a
sacred mountain of revolution...

748
01:05:35,128 --> 01:05:37,995
...and as the true home of our hearts.

749
01:05:39,466 --> 01:05:46,235
Mount Paekdu, sacred mountain
of the revolution. Kim Jong Il

750
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,437
Every North Korean is expected
to make the pilgrimage to Paekdu

751
01:05:50,438 --> 01:05:51,838
at some point in their lives.

752
01:06:00,153 --> 01:06:00,983
Look, look at that!

753
01:06:01,054 --> 01:06:02,851
Wow, it's amazing.

754
01:06:02,923 --> 01:06:04,413
It would be great in winter.

755
01:06:04,491 --> 01:06:06,550
I want to swim in Lake Chon.

756
01:06:11,631 --> 01:06:13,189
Hey, it looks like it's frozen.

757
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:15,928
The water must be quite cool.

758
01:06:16,002 --> 01:06:18,436
I was surprised when I saw Lake Chon.

759
01:06:18,505 --> 01:06:21,133
I pictured Mount Paekdu only in my mind...

760
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:25,167
...as I heard the explanation
from my teacher.

761
01:06:25,245 --> 01:06:27,270
However, when I saw it with my own eyes...

762
01:06:27,347 --> 01:06:31,010
I was more than surprised and thought:

763
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:36,818
"Wow, what a fascinating and
magnificent view it is!"

764
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:44,189
Look, look at Hyon Sun.

765
01:06:59,446 --> 01:07:05,248
The moment I saw Lake Chon,
its pure and crystal clear water...

766
01:07:05,819 --> 01:07:07,286
...I made up my mind.

767
01:07:07,821 --> 01:07:11,552
I will live as the daughter of the
General and of Mount Paekdu.

768
01:07:15,262 --> 01:07:16,524
I'm scared.

769
01:07:43,223 --> 01:07:46,056
This is the second tallest
statue in our country.

770
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:52,321
Admiration to the Great Leader.

771
01:08:01,842 --> 01:08:07,303
Those lectures made me think a lot.

772
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:13,819
Teacher, why don't you come in too?

773
01:08:14,955 --> 01:08:18,948
When I go back home I will tell
these stories to my friends...

774
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:22,017
...so they can grow up...

775
01:08:22,095 --> 01:08:26,930
...as daughters of the General
and Mount Paekdu.

776
01:08:34,975 --> 01:08:36,533
Come quickly.

777
01:08:38,445 --> 01:08:39,673
It's so cold!

778
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:53,231
Look how pretty Song Yon is!

779
01:08:58,532 --> 01:09:04,664
When I go back, I will participate in
Mass Games with my friends.

780
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:09,038
When I face the difficult and hard tasks...

781
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:11,839
...during my practice for Mass Games...

782
01:09:13,013 --> 01:09:15,038
...I will always discipline my mind
picturing Mount Paekdu.

783
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:19,885
Jong Il Peak

784
01:09:48,515 --> 01:09:51,780
The girls return to Pyongyang in
time for July 27th.

785
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,949
Considering it is the 50th
anniversary of what is seen

786
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,850
as a great victory
over an imperialist aggressor,

787
01:09:59,559 --> 01:10:01,789
Pyongyang is strangely muted.

788
01:10:10,904 --> 01:10:14,006
Kim Il Sung's statue is
the focus of remembrance,

789
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:16,207
as it was he who led
the nation through the War.

790
01:10:18,878 --> 01:10:23,781
Pride of place goes to a bouquet sent
personally by his son Kim Jong Il.

791
01:10:27,954 --> 01:10:31,858
The city bursts into life that evening
as 30,000 adults

792
01:10:31,893 --> 01:10:33,985
dance on Kim Il Sung square.

793
01:10:35,662 --> 01:10:39,257
Yet there seems little to celebrate.
50 years on from the war

794
01:10:39,466 --> 01:10:41,696
a peace treaty has never been signed.

795
01:10:43,603 --> 01:10:48,666
Korea remains divided, the North is still
seen as a pariah in the western world,

796
01:10:49,142 --> 01:10:53,875
and the Korean peninsula continues to
live with the threat of catastrophic war.

797
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:59,175
If war broke out in Korea, there would be

798
01:10:59,252 --> 01:11:00,651
one million casualties with the first 24 hours.

799
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,881
- Pentagon estimate 1993

800
01:11:31,251 --> 01:11:34,584
At the time of the war, there was nothing.

801
01:11:34,654 --> 01:11:35,586
Everything was in ashes.

802
01:11:36,189 --> 01:11:38,180
From that time onwards...

803
01:11:38,258 --> 01:11:42,058
...we really started construction
with a new strong resolve.

804
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:55,403
The reason this was necessary...

805
01:11:56,309 --> 01:11:59,278
...was in order to completely
transform our capital.

806
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:06,377
If you build somebody a house,
they can live their life there.

807
01:12:07,153 --> 01:12:11,613
As people live there, they feel their
life is more worthwhile...

808
01:12:12,258 --> 01:12:14,522
...and they can work better, putting
more energy into production.

809
01:12:14,594 --> 01:12:18,189
Therefore, we have to keep on
developing our construction...

810
01:12:18,998 --> 01:12:20,727
...and not fall behind other countries.

811
01:12:31,277 --> 01:12:35,373
I have been mobilized on construction
projects for 35 years.

812
01:12:36,816 --> 01:12:40,274
It's tiring doing this kind of construction.

813
01:12:40,353 --> 01:12:45,450
When you finish it, you feel pride
every time you look at it.

814
01:12:45,525 --> 01:12:49,859
And you feel it was worthwhile.

815
01:12:50,396 --> 01:12:55,766
So often I think, "In our lives,
we really have to build things."

816
01:13:00,507 --> 01:13:05,342
We obey the slogan that "one is all,
and all are one."

817
01:13:06,012 --> 01:13:10,813
A team working on one project will
be of "one mind and one body."

818
01:13:10,884 --> 01:13:15,253
We're making efforts to
solve every problem.

819
01:13:17,924 --> 01:13:22,494
Hyon Sun's Grandfather's latest
project is North Korea's first ever

820
01:13:22,495 --> 01:13:23,495
officially sanctioned market.

821
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:27,898
The market will be state owned but
some stalls will be privately run.

822
01:13:28,535 --> 01:13:30,867
It is a wholly foreign concept to him.

823
01:13:34,808 --> 01:13:41,543
As far as I know, I'm building
something called a market.

824
01:13:42,215 --> 01:13:45,184
There's no question that it's being built...

825
01:13:45,251 --> 01:13:47,276
...in order to improve people's
lives in the future.

826
01:13:48,154 --> 01:13:53,922
But I don't yet know how it will be run.

827
01:13:54,627 --> 01:13:59,394
We people are all curious
about such a market.

828
01:14:04,137 --> 01:14:06,298
Our apartment is the best one I've built.

829
01:14:06,372 --> 01:14:10,069
For a start, the interior is good.

830
01:14:11,044 --> 01:14:15,003
And because everything else is good...

831
01:14:15,081 --> 01:14:17,572
...the location, the quality of the
construction materials...

832
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:19,777
...the apartment we live in is a good one.

833
01:14:34,133 --> 01:14:36,202
Central Pyongyang awakens to

834
01:14:36,203 --> 01:14:38,503
loudspeakers playing
revolutionary music.

835
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,571
The whole of the city,
two million people,

836
01:14:43,572 --> 01:14:47,272
has been mobilized for the
September 9th celebrations,

837
01:14:47,347 --> 01:14:50,510
which commemorate 55 years
of the founding of the republic.

838
01:14:52,352 --> 01:14:55,185
The celebrations will be
of epic proportions.

839
01:14:57,891 --> 01:15:01,092
On September 9th, there will be
a military parade,

840
01:15:01,093 --> 01:15:02,693
followed by a people's parade,

841
01:15:03,162 --> 01:15:05,653
both reviewed by Kim Jong Il.

842
01:15:08,368 --> 01:15:11,972
At night there will be
dancing on Kim Il Sung square,

843
01:15:11,973 --> 01:15:13,773
and a youth torch light parade.

844
01:15:15,341 --> 01:15:20,472
The Mass Games will take place the
following day, on September 10th.

845
01:15:29,188 --> 01:15:30,849
Kim Il Sung Square

846
01:15:30,924 --> 01:15:35,418
An estimated one million people will take
part in the three parades of the day.

847
01:15:36,296 --> 01:15:40,663
In North Korea, the parades are
the ultimate display of strength,

848
01:15:40,664 --> 01:15:42,964
unity, loyalty and devotion.

849
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:51,006
Although the images of the Parade
will be transmitted worldwide,

850
01:15:51,007 --> 01:15:52,807
the target audience is internal.

851
01:15:53,713 --> 01:15:56,409
The Parade reinforces the power
of the collective.

852
01:15:56,716 --> 01:16:00,618
It is also the biggest opportunity
for the people of North Korea

853
01:16:00,619 --> 01:16:02,519
to see and pay homage
to their Leader.

854
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:25,907
As they march past, they cry 'Mansei'
which means "Long Live!"

855
01:16:28,815 --> 01:16:33,047
At the climax of the two hour spectacle,
all eyes turn to one man.

856
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,787
Only State officials are allowed to
film Kim Jong Il,

857
01:16:37,357 --> 01:16:39,985
and when he comes to
the balcony,

858
01:16:39,986 --> 01:16:42,386
security personnel try to
prevent even a snap shot.

859
01:16:52,638 --> 01:16:54,606
The celebrations are far from over.

860
01:16:55,108 --> 01:16:59,477
There is still a youth torchlight parade to
come, and dancing on Kim Il Sung Square.

861
01:17:00,013 --> 01:17:03,176
And tomorrow is the first performance
of Mass Games.

862
01:17:21,034 --> 01:17:24,162
Would there be an army as disciplined
as ours in any other country?

863
01:17:24,237 --> 01:17:25,761
No!

864
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:29,097
Wow, they make perfect lines.

865
01:17:29,175 --> 01:17:33,172
Their legs move like machines.
They're exactly the same height.

866
01:17:34,947 --> 01:17:36,812
They move like one person.

867
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,378
Thank you.

868
01:17:48,027 --> 01:17:48,755
Let's eat dinner.

869
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:52,290
Are you hungry?

870
01:17:52,365 --> 01:17:53,093
Say hello to our guests first.

871
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:53,825
I just did.

872
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,425
Did you say hello to them
at Hyon Sun's room?

873
01:17:56,502 --> 01:17:58,299
Yes, at the door.

874
01:18:01,841 --> 01:18:04,639
They saluted first so I saluted back.

875
01:18:05,812 --> 01:18:07,575
Let's watch her on the TV.

876
01:18:08,548 --> 01:18:11,038
Let's see if your mum looks OK on the TV.

877
01:18:12,251 --> 01:18:13,548
No, in the second row here.

878
01:18:13,619 --> 01:18:15,211
No, I'm in the front, here.

879
01:18:15,288 --> 01:18:17,255
Yes, in the second row from the front.

880
01:18:18,391 --> 01:18:20,188
I thought I was in the very front row.

881
01:18:21,961 --> 01:18:22,757
After this.

882
01:18:22,829 --> 01:18:23,796
Oh, after this?

883
01:18:26,299 --> 01:18:32,238
No wonder even arrogant Americans
tremble with fear to see this.

884
01:18:33,473 --> 01:18:36,738
As long as we have the
General, we are fine.

885
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:48,556
In less than fourteen hours time,

886
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:51,457
it will be Hyon Sun's turn to
perform in front of the General.

887
01:18:53,259 --> 01:18:58,094
Until now, thinking of the glorious
day of serving the General...

888
01:18:58,798 --> 01:19:03,599
...I have trained hard with loyalty
and sweated devotion.

889
01:19:05,438 --> 01:19:07,599
Though I was selected to perform
in the centre, I got really upset.

890
01:19:07,673 --> 01:19:09,004
I kept making mistakes.

891
01:19:10,176 --> 01:19:13,543
So sometimes I practiced until 10pm.

892
01:19:15,882 --> 01:19:19,181
Watching the parades, which are
constantly repeated on TV,

893
01:19:19,252 --> 01:19:22,619
are an inspiration to her and
reinforce her will.

894
01:19:25,324 --> 01:19:29,021
When I think that I will perform in front
of the General tomorrow...

895
01:19:29,095 --> 01:19:31,723
...my heart trembles and pounds.

896
01:19:31,797 --> 01:19:34,357
I don't think I'll even get to sleep tonight.

897
01:19:37,436 --> 01:19:38,767
Father, have you also participated
in this kind of thing?

898
01:19:39,372 --> 01:19:42,466
Me? Well... I'm sorry to say...

899
01:19:43,809 --> 01:19:46,869
...that I haven't joined the review
in the presence of the General.

900
01:19:48,281 --> 01:19:50,010
Your dad has done Mass Games
in front of the General many times...

901
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:51,879
...when he went to the primary school.

902
01:19:51,951 --> 01:19:54,476
I did many ceremonies indeed
for Mass Games.

903
01:19:55,621 --> 01:19:57,213
I'm wondering whether our
father, the General...

904
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:59,349
...will actually turn up for our performance.

905
01:20:01,594 --> 01:20:08,124
If he can't make it, we will be
really disappointed.

906
01:20:09,769 --> 01:20:15,173
Even if he can't, he may not come,
he may be busy with his business.

907
01:20:15,241 --> 01:20:17,209
It will be fine if you have that in your
mind while you perform.

908
01:20:17,276 --> 01:20:18,300
So perform well.

909
01:20:18,844 --> 01:20:19,572
Can you do that?

910
01:20:19,645 --> 01:20:20,907
Yes, I can.

911
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:26,714
I really hope the General will come...

912
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:40,829
It's 7 in the morning, four hours
before the performance.

913
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:43,901
This is the biggest day of the girls' lives.

914
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:52,075
Did you put everything in?

915
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:54,772
Yes, I did. I only need my lunch.

916
01:20:54,847 --> 01:20:55,643
A snack!

917
01:20:56,682 --> 01:20:57,410
Take an apple.

918
01:20:57,483 --> 01:20:58,381
Or do you want biscuits?

919
01:21:00,553 --> 01:21:01,383
Whatever...

920
01:21:06,826 --> 01:21:07,349
I take them all.

921
01:21:07,426 --> 01:21:08,051
You greedy pig...

922
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:08,743
It's 8.30am, two and a half hours
before the performance.

923
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:13,049
Every available area of the gymnasium,
outside and in,

924
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:14,850
is used for last
minute preparations.

925
01:23:51,757 --> 01:23:55,520
Hyon Sun and Song Yon's performance
is the eleventh chapter

926
01:23:55,521 --> 01:23:57,321
of a 13 part
revolutionary story.

927
01:23:58,297 --> 01:24:02,597
Their chapter is entitled 'Our country
which is glorified with independence'.

928
01:24:03,903 --> 01:24:07,395
Each of the 6000 performers is
synchronized to the group,

929
01:24:07,807 --> 01:24:10,935
each group to its chapter and each
chapter to the whole.

930
01:24:11,444 --> 01:24:16,882
Everyone will act as one, an embodiment
of the Juche philosophy of self-reliance.

931
01:24:18,284 --> 01:24:21,082
The performance is entitled
'Army First Korea'.

932
01:24:21,587 --> 01:24:23,748
It has been six months in the
planning and will last for 45 minutes.

933
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,790
Kim Jong Il is unable to attend.

934
01:27:13,726 --> 01:27:16,257
Song-yeon,
at the tender age of 11,

935
01:27:16,258 --> 01:27:20,058
has got the honor of performing
on the second front line.

936
01:28:15,454 --> 01:28:16,785
I had been wondering
whether I could perform...

937
01:28:16,855 --> 01:28:18,948
...in front of our father, the General...

938
01:28:19,024 --> 01:28:22,482
...but disappointingly, he couldn't come.

939
01:28:22,561 --> 01:28:24,358
However, since the General
couldn't come...

940
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:26,489
...because he was busy
working for the country...

941
01:28:26,565 --> 01:28:28,726
...my friends and I all understand.

942
01:28:39,645 --> 01:28:42,705
Finally, when the day came and our
act was about to start...

943
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:44,248
...I was extremely nervous.

944
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:47,312
For Hyon Sun this is her proudest moment.

945
01:28:47,519 --> 01:28:51,285
She will be in the centre of the front
row, the pivotal figure of the act.

946
01:28:51,557 --> 01:28:53,616
The honor could not be greater.

947
01:28:53,826 --> 01:28:57,887
This is her chance to prove herself
to be a perfect communist.

948
01:31:27,088 --> 01:31:32,088
Hyon Sun and Song Yon performed
twice a day for twenty days.

949
01:31:46,089 --> 01:31:50,589
Kim Jong Il was unable to
attend any of the performances.

950
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:15,090
The day after the final performance Hyon
Sun and Song Yon were back at training.

951
01:32:19,091 --> 01:32:26,091
No-one knows when
the next Mass Games will be.
