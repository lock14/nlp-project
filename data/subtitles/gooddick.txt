1
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:44,999
Hi.

2
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:47,681
- Just these?
- Yeah.

3
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,960
Uh... can I make a suggestion?

4
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:59,287
I thought this looked like it had amazing
potential too, but it is actually really bad.

5
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:03,121
It's, like, two definitely underage
European girls

6
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:06,324
hitchhiking through
the most unattractive shots of Germany,

7
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:10,241
greasy fat guys,
like, basically, raping them.

8
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:12,966
L- i-i-it's a turn-off.

9
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:16,926
We should probably move it
to a different section - like "bad".

10
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:18,565
Um...

11
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:25,966
- Do you wanna pick out something else?
- No, thanks.

12
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:29,403
- Are you sure? We're open till midnight.
- Just these.

13
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,886
Just these three, then?

14
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,316
OK.

15
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:39,796
- Will you, uh?
- Yeah.

16
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,716
How're you doing?

17
00:03:58,087 --> 00:04:00,043
Great.

18
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:08,125
<i>OK. Get that.</i>

19
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:12,396
<i>Two seconds.</i>

20
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:23,205
Due back Friday before midnight.

21
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,763
Dude.

22
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:31,997
You can't talk to the porn customers

23
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:38,037
the same way you talk to the ones
who are renting Truffaut for the 12th time.

24
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:42,484
- That was an incredibly odd exchange.
- Thanks, dude.

25
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:46,116
I think it's cool.
Now we know she's not mute.

26
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:08,080
- We're in a new period of time.
- McDonald's on every corner in Poland.

27
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,397
- Right, dude?
- Yep.

28
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:14,446
Think we're free cos we can choose
between a latte or a mocha in Starbucks?

29
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:19,726
- That's not freedom, man.
- Bad situation. Bad situation.

30
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,560
History's cyclical.
It's all gonna come back around.

31
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:27,437
- Bullshit! We're all fucked.
- You guys been watching Charlie Rose?

32
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,280
We are changing
what it means to be human.

33
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:35,202
Oh, come on. I mean, we've always been
changing what it means to be human.

34
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:39,599
The pendulum has to swing all the way to
the extreme before it swings back again.

35
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:44,807
Pendulum? What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the end of the world.

36
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:53,481
- Good night.
- Later, dude.

37
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:11,242
<i>- Hello?
- Uh...</i>

38
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:13,716
<i>- Delivery.
- What?</i>

39
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,401
UPS.

40
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:20,160
<i>One moment.</i>

41
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:06,203
Hi.

42
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:09,324
- Don't I know you from the video store?
- I was there yesterday.

43
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:11,967
Yeah, yeah!

44
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:14,436
Hey, uh, maybe we could... Oh!

45
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:19,002
...uh, just get a coffee or something?

46
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,965
Just as friends or film buffs?

47
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:35,401
- Can we rent all of these?
- Can we rent all three?

48
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:39,366
- Please. We love Alain Delon.
- Sure.

49
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:42,245
When are they due back?

50
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,161
- What?
- How long can we rent them?

51
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:49,116
Uh, Wednesday before midnight.

52
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,364
Hey. It's me.

53
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:21,917
I have a friend in the building.

54
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:24,646
I just wanted to let you know,
cos yesterday...

55
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,685
Uh, anyway, I, uh...
I have a present for you.

56
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:35,602
It's a really great one.
OK. L-I'd still like to take you out.

57
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:37,917
We could go to the, um...

58
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:42,046
Museum of Jurassic Technology.
Do you know about that place?

59
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:45,403
I'm really great at picking out films
for people.

60
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:48,604
It's... it's a gift I have.

61
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:51,281
If you can even call this a film.

62
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:55,239
- This is from the video store?
- Oh, yeah.

63
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:59,957
Uh, yes, it is.
But, you know, no charge, or...

64
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:04,723
- I'll return it with the others.
- Cool.

65
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:09,403
Oh, when you know me
there aren't any late fees, so...

66
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:11,842
Hope you enjoy it.

67
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:58,042
- Hi.
- Yes?

68
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:01,357
What did you think?
Can I come in?

69
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:04,245
- No. No!
- Can I come in for a second?

70
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:10,759
My... great-aunt
had to go to the hospital.

71
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,758
What?

72
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:18,001
She's the one who lives in the building.
Guess I'm looking after her place now.

73
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:21,124
But did... did you wanna
get some breakfast or something?

74
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,720
- I could really go...
- No.

75
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:26,641
Don't ask me again.
It's a waste of time to keep asking me.

76
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:29,036
I'm sorry about your aunt.

77
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:31,322
I hope she's OK.

78
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,876
So that's a black mamba.
First deadliest snake in the entire world.

79
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:42,356
Hey, here she comes.

80
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,164
Hey.

81
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:52,804
I don't know what the second deadliest is.
You said taipan?

82
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:16,957
<i>Go away!</i>

83
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:20,517
- No, please. Something's happened!
- Go away! I'll call the super!

84
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:23,679
No, please. I need your help.
She died.

85
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:26,361
<i>She's dead.
Please can I come in?</i>

86
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:29,723
I don't have anyone.
I'm all alone.

87
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:32,196
She died.
I don't have anyone.

88
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:44,124
- Oh, fuck! What is that thing for?
- It's in case you fucking try anything.

89
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:53,923
Um, can I open some windows?
I just feel like I can't breathe.

90
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,837
Talk.

91
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:14,487
I was gonna talk.

92
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,843
About my great-aunt.

93
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:20,122
Talk then.

94
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:24,002
Well, um...

95
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:28,196
you have a really nice apartment.

96
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,881
- Which apartment did she live in?
- Uh...

97
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:34,437
- Is this trash?
- Yeah.

98
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:37,360
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna throw it away. OK?

99
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,438
OK.

100
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,199
You wanna know something
my great-aunt said tonight?

101
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,323
What?

102
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:55,925
She said, um, "Knowledge is when
you learn something new every day,

103
00:16:56,007 --> 00:17:00,762
wisdom is when
you let something go every day. "

104
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:03,077
Emerson said that.

105
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:07,915
- You know that quote?
- Yeah.

106
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:13,485
She didn't come up with that one
on the spot tonight, sorry.

107
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:18,844
Well, anyway, she knew the quote.

108
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:21,043
I knew your aunt.

109
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:25,803
I'd see her at the mailbox downstairs.
She always said hello to me.

110
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,558
Um...

111
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:36,600
It's OK to watch erotica.
And I say that as a lifelong Catholic.

112
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:39,645
Catholics are pervs.

113
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:43,276
- Not me.
- Well, you're not a priest.

114
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,515
You're right.
I am not a priest.

115
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:04,084
No one really gets fucked in the films
you rent. There's no penetration.

116
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:12,479
And I also understand the allure of the
old battered VHSs. They're like antiques.

117
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,956
I don't wanna talk about it.

118
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:17,436
Yeah, OK.
Neither do I.

119
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:24,641
I think you just call it
that place between your collarbones.

120
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:26,922
Is it the sternum?

121
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,356
Yeah. Maybe.

122
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:35,718
Anyway...

123
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:39,601
I gotta go to bed.

124
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,525
I'm really sorry about your aunt.

125
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:47,643
Um...

126
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:51,197
Could I...
maybe sleep on your couch tonight?

127
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,004
Um...

128
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,276
Hey, why are you late?

129
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:28,240
You know it's Simon's day off.

130
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,842
- I have never been late before.
- I know.

131
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:35,966
- I thought you were dead.
- Sorry. I am so sorry.

132
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:38,959
<i>Your mamus called.</i>

133
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:43,438
- Oh, fuck! That's right, it's Wednesday!
- Yeah.

134
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:48,237
Yeah, she had a bit of an emotional
outburst cos you missed your phone date.

135
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:52,957
You've never been late before.
She started screaming at me in Polish.

136
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:55,641
- I've had to smoke this to relax.
- I'm sorry.

137
00:20:57,607 --> 00:21:02,920
That'll be her.
Every ten minutes for a solid two hours.

138
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:05,726
She's scaring Derek.

139
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,560
<i>Czesc mamus.</i>

140
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:14,926
- She's messed up, Simon.
- You don't know that, dude.

141
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:20,286
She just doesn't love me. And me having
this whole lot of love for her doesn't help.

142
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:22,642
I've been thinking
about the great writers.

143
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:25,719
How many of them were really in love?
In love for decades?

144
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:27,126
None of them.

145
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:30,597
How many were in love with some girl
they were fucking at the time

146
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:36,125
who didn't even love them back,
in this lonely torturous existence?

147
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:38,641
An empty fucking cave.

148
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:42,083
- Did you find her clit, Simon?
- What?

149
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,397
You know where her clit is, right?

150
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:46,239
I think so.

151
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:49,125
- You don't know?
- Yeah, I know.

152
00:22:49,207 --> 00:22:51,198
So where is it?

153
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,677
- It's... it's... it's where everything...
- Where?

154
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:58,203
- It's where all the stuff is.
- It looks like the flux capacitor.

155
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:00,403
Oh, my God!

156
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:02,921
- Stop looking at me, Eric.
- I thought you knew.

157
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,682
This accounts for 90%% % of your problems
with this chick, I swear.

158
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:11,716
- You don't know what it is, do you?
- It's an anatomical part of the female...

159
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,126
<i>vagina.</i>

160
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:15,323
Shut the fuck up, Derek.

161
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:18,763
- Do you know what it is?
- The clitoris? Yes, I do.

162
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:22,203
I am religious about the clitoris.

163
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:09,916
- Did you get the tape?
- Yeah, I got it.

164
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:12,202
You're liking them, right?

165
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:14,680
Shut up.

166
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:18,999
They're terrible, but...
but that's part of it for you, right?

167
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:21,999
Where's your cross?

168
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:24,043
Checking out my neck, huh?

169
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:33,600
- I know you're not Catholic.
- Yeah. Sorry.

170
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:35,917
No. It still counts.
I'd like you to wear it.

171
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:39,716
- It's better safety than a meat cleaver.
- Butcher knife.

172
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,526
This will keep you safer
than any butcher knife could.

173
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:45,167
Safe from you?

174
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:48,922
I guess. I mean, you feel like
you need protection, so...

175
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,759
- Whoa! Before you put it on!
- What?

176
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:53,884
I have to wash your hair.

177
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:56,037
You can't wear a cross with dirty hair.

178
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:58,405
<i>Argh!</i>

179
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:01,240
- Oh, I hate this!
- It's almost done.

180
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:07,357
- The water's getting in my eyes.
- It is not. I'm being careful. You know it.

181
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:09,039
OK.

182
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,561
OK. Done.
You're done.

183
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,637
OK. Come here.

184
00:27:19,727 --> 00:27:21,922
Here. Sit right...

185
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:36,481
Polish people wash each other?

186
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,125
Yeah.

187
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:42,200
- I've never heard of that before.
- How many Polish people do you know?

188
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,039
None.

189
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:47,563
- You know me.
- Not really.

190
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:55,525
- This will keep you safe.
- You said that already.

191
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,485
- Let me put it on.
- No. I have to put it on.

192
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:00,797
Fine.

193
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:13,000
But don't brush my hair any more.
I'm... don't like it.

194
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,642
"I'm don't like it. "

195
00:28:30,327 --> 00:28:33,399
Do... do you wanna watch
one of your... movies?

196
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,876
Do you wanna watch one together?

197
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:40,962
You have to go or I'll get upset.
Don't upset me.

198
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,162
OK.

199
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:48,442
I'm going.

200
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:52,155
We'II... do it another time.

201
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:00,476
I care about you.

202
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:34,598
Wake up, buddy.
Hi. Excuse me.

203
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:36,484
What?

204
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:47,395
Roll down your window, please.

205
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:50,320
Uh... yeah?

206
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:54,685
You can't be, uh,
sleeping in the parking lot.

207
00:29:54,767 --> 00:30:00,000
Um, yeah. My wife kicked me out
for the night, but, uh...

208
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:03,477
Yeah. I'm sorry. Um...
It's a one-time thing. Won't happen again.

209
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:07,765
I know, I know. It's just we saw you
for the past six nights or so. So...

210
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,077
Yeah, I know. Um...

211
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:15,525
She kicked me out a while ago, but I'm
about to get back into her good graces.

212
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:18,121
But I shouldn't
be sleeping in the parking lot.

213
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:21,677
Cos, see, if we catch you again
we're gonna have to call the cops.

214
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:26,795
And my boss wanted to call the cops this
morning, but I wanted to warn you first.

215
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:31,358
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.
- I'm assistant manager.

216
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:36,597
Yeah. Cool.
All right. Um...

217
00:30:36,687 --> 00:30:39,406
All right. I'm leaving now.

218
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:41,682
Watch your fingers.

219
00:30:43,327 --> 00:30:45,158
Bye.

220
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:50,365
<i>- She doesn't want to see me.
- I'm so sorry, man.</i>

221
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:54,725
I don't ever want to talk about this again.
So, um...

222
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:59,438
It's weird that
that girl stopped coming in.

223
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:02,564
- Which girl?
- That weird one.

224
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:04,877
<i>- How long's it been?
- About a week.</i>

225
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:07,925
<i>- She came in every day.
- Late afternoon.</i>

226
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:11,556
Yeah. It's been ever since
loverboy here scared her away.

227
00:31:11,647 --> 00:31:14,036
Told you she's weird, man.

228
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:17,603
She's probably sitting
in a garbage can,

229
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:20,485
still embarrassed
you tried to talk to her.

230
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:25,361
- Isn't it your day off?
- Yeah, what are you, a loser?

231
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:29,645
I was getting some groceries
in the neighbourhood, Simon.

232
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,797
You live in Echo Park.

233
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:34,003
Yeah, I still need groceries.

234
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:36,760
All the stores in this neighbourhood
are Pan-Asian.

235
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:39,236
Fuck off, you guys, OK?

236
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:41,363
Maybe I wanted to make a stir-fry.

237
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:45,884
Plus there's, like, ten grocery stores
within a mile of your house, dude.

238
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:51,405
I like the breeze on this side of town.
It's... ocean breeze. It... clears my head.

239
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:53,682
Yeah. Just admit it, dude.

240
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:57,838
- What?
- You have no life.

241
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,839
Is this because of that bitch
whose clit you could never find?

242
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:04,077
Derek!

243
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:06,722
You're an imbecile.

244
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:10,040
I'm never talking to you again.

245
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,243
Agh!

246
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:15,080
- Dude.
- He bothers me, man. A lot.

247
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:19,206
- Have a heart. They just broke up.
- I don't care. He really bothers me.

248
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:26,520
I'll sit behind you, like this,
so you don't see me.

249
00:32:26,607 --> 00:32:29,997
- OK? And I won't make a sound.
- Not a word.

250
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:32,366
Promise.

251
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:34,836
- Do you have a cellphone?
- No.

252
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:46,676
I can't do anything while you're here,
so it kind of ruins it for me.

253
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:50,646
- Kind of boring if you aren't getting off.
- Shut up.

254
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:52,957
- You said you wouldn't talk.
- You talked to me.

255
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:57,040
I can do that. I can talk to you.
You can't talk to me.

256
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:06,040
Plus, I just thought of one more rule.

257
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:08,357
If you get a boner,

258
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,482
you're out.

259
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:35,155
- Well...
- Hey.

260
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,886
Hold down the fort, OK?
Eric and I are going next door.

261
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:41,277
And, uh, Simon's in the back.
Don't tell him where we went.

262
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,562
He'll miss me too much.

263
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:49,402
Which movie?

264
00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:55,238
OK. Cool.
Is it from the '70s?

265
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,716
Well, tell me which decade!

266
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:04,155
I doubt it. Why would I like it?
You think I'm gonna like it that much?

267
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:11,683
I hate this.

268
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:17,125
I hate this shit. I hate all of this bullshit!
I can't believe you thought I'd be into this!

269
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:20,602
God, I am so bored.

270
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,605
Oh, how big is this guy's dick,
would you say?

271
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,360
It's hard to tell.

272
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:29,517
Not as big as mine, though.

273
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:32,438
What?

274
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:35,644
Your penis is not even half of that,
I bet.

275
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:39,320
Excuse me.
How would you know?

276
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:44,806
I've seen it, bulging out your pants,
and it's not that.

277
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:49,315
So, been checking out my bulge!

278
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:52,479
- Don't call it a bulge.
- When was this?

279
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:57,687
I don't even remember. I just remember
thinking there's probably not much to it.

280
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:00,884
Mm. You must have me
confused with someone else.

281
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:05,085
Look, I don't care.
The size, I don't care.

282
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:07,920
It's just really pitiful if you lie about it.

283
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,085
OK. That guy is, what?
What would you say?

284
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:14,317
- I'd say I don't care.
- No, let's make a bet.

285
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:19,720
If I am bigger than that guy,
then I get to sleep in your bed tonight.

286
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:21,160
No.

287
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:24,398
Come on! It's a fair bet.

288
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:27,047
If I am bigger than that guy, I win!

289
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,925
- It's so late! No touching...
- No touching?

290
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:35,206
No touching, I swear. I can't sleep out here
again. I get so cold. It's desert cold.

291
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:39,356
- What do I get if I win?
- What do you want if you win?

292
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:43,520
I want you to not talk at all
when you come over here.

293
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:46,804
Just make the food,
we'll watch the movie

294
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:49,640
and you don't speak.

295
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:54,042
I can do that.

296
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:09,038
OK, well, proportionally,
let's say he's eight.

297
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,799
- Eight and a half.
- Sure.

298
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:14,357
- Let's say eight and a half.
- Well, let's just say he's eight.

299
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:18,520
You have to be bigger than him to win.
Remember?

300
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:24,403
OK. Uh, well, how do you want to measure
me? It has to be erect to make it fair.

301
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:26,603
- Fuck that!
- I do! He is fucking erect!

302
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:29,565
Fine!
You measure yourself, though.

303
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:32,639
- I'm not fucking touching you.
- Fine.

304
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:37,957
OK. Um...

305
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:42,242
Are you gonna put a sock over it
or something?

306
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:45,922
- Over my cock?
- Don't fucking say "cock".

307
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:48,282
- Over my... dick?
- Ugh.

308
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:52,360
- You're such a pig.
- Over my... pee-wee?

309
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:56,519
- This is why you shouldn't talk.
- OK. OK. So...

310
00:36:56,607 --> 00:37:03,558
confirming if my... penis is bigger
than eight-and-a-half inches,

311
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:06,445
I get to sleep in your bed tonight.

312
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:11,036
Use one of your socks to cover it.
I don't wanna see it.

313
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,482
W- well, how will you be sure how big it is
if you don't see it?

314
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,604
I'll observe from over here.

315
00:37:21,727 --> 00:37:23,683
OK.

316
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:25,758
Um...

317
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:31,356
I just have to concentrate.

318
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,924
OK.

319
00:37:39,087 --> 00:37:41,442
I mean it, I will call the police
if you rape me.

320
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:45,839
I'm here every night. Don't you think
I would have tried by now?

321
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:49,363
<i>- Just don't do anything, OK?
- OK!</i>

322
00:37:57,487 --> 00:38:00,320
It's cold in your house
in the middle of the night.

323
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:02,796
It gets pretty cold.

324
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:11,081
I'm not trying anything.

325
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:16,838
Can I just...
put my back up against yours?

326
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:20,322
OK.

327
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:39,675
<i>This is called plecki o plecki.</i>

328
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:47,526
<i>My Polish grandmother, babcia,
used to make us sleep like this, in pairs,</i>

329
00:38:47,607 --> 00:38:49,802
when we were kids.

330
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:57,476
She did it as a kid, too. It was the only
way they kept warm during the winter.

331
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,842
<i>Lecki o plecki.</i>

332
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:04,601
They lived in a hut and she didn't
get her period until she was 17

333
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:07,281
cos she was so malnourished.

334
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:12,322
<i>Lecy are your back.</i>

335
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:17,482
I mean,
all your back muscles are one thing.

336
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,559
<i>But "plecy" is plural.</i>

337
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:23,478
That's nice.

338
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,517
I love this.

339
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:32,200
Was your great-aunt Polish too?

340
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:36,078
Um, yeah.

341
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:40,600
It feels like we're connected.

342
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:59,036
I started my period.

343
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:15,196
- Let's go out.
- I don't like LA.

344
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:20,319
- What? You live here.
- I don't go out to places, I mean.

345
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:31,637
- You're touching me again.
- I know.

346
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:44,278
On the first day of their period,
girls are sick,

347
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:48,485
so even if I was a normal girl, I still
couldn't go anywhere with you today.

348
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:50,876
You are normal.

349
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:54,118
- Hey, do you want some tea?
- Yeah.

350
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:57,165
- Honey?
- I don't have any.

351
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,442
I brought some for you.

352
00:41:59,527 --> 00:42:02,121
Honey's better than sugar.

353
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:05,005
Honey's better than sugar?

354
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:08,442
I bought it for you.

355
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:30,525
Fuck.

356
00:42:30,607 --> 00:42:33,883
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

357
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:36,561
I'm fucking... fucking...

358
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:38,842
I'm fucking. I'm fucking.

359
00:42:38,927 --> 00:42:41,919
I'm gonna come. I'm gonna come.
I'm gonna come.

360
00:42:42,007 --> 00:42:45,716
Uh! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

361
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:58,326
What do you think?

362
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:02,116
- I think you're funny.
- You thought that was funny?

363
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,801
Yeah.
Can I do it to you now?

364
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,761
Great.

365
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:11,042
Uh, whatever you want.

366
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:13,687
Uh, the same fish
I made last week.

367
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:17,762
We'll chowder the halibut.

368
00:43:19,487 --> 00:43:22,604
OK, I'll see you after I'm done.
Bye. Thanks for calling.

369
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:25,076
- Who's that?
- A customer.

370
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:28,556
"See you after I'm done"?

371
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,360
It's a movie.

372
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:34,915
- Really?
- Yeah.

373
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,202
It's a Scottish...

374
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:39,716
movie.

375
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:51,363
I got some sleep for the first time in a long
time, having you in the bed last night.

376
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:55,201
- That's good.
- Get off!

377
00:44:08,287 --> 00:44:10,357
<i>- Night, you guys.
- Auf Wieder.</i>

378
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,642
<i>- What?
- Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

379
00:44:12,727 --> 00:44:15,605
- I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Not if I see you first.

380
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:19,566
- Not talking to you.
- All right, goodbye, Simon!

381
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:21,842
Come on, guys.

382
00:44:37,127 --> 00:44:39,721
- I should probably head.
- Sit.

383
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,843
Want one?

384
00:44:43,927 --> 00:44:46,316
- No, Eric.
- OK.

385
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,523
Why do you always ask me?
It gets annoying.

386
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:52,917
Dunno. Polite.
One day you might want one.

387
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:55,396
- I don't smoke.
- OK.

388
00:44:56,647 --> 00:44:59,719
I went past your place yesterday.

389
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:01,399
Huh?

390
00:45:01,487 --> 00:45:05,639
I went past where your apartment should
have been. It was a huge pile of rubble.

391
00:45:05,727 --> 00:45:08,844
It's demolished, man.
Wire fence, cement mixers...

392
00:45:08,927 --> 00:45:11,122
Yeah, I moved.

393
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:14,597
- Where to?
- Another apartment.

394
00:45:14,687 --> 00:45:16,405
When?

395
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:19,718
- A few months ago.
- Why didn't you say anything?

396
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:22,401
I didn't think it was a big deal.

397
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,126
- Are you living in your car again?
- No!

398
00:45:25,207 --> 00:45:28,404
So you haven't spent
one night in that car?

399
00:45:29,647 --> 00:45:31,797
- Dude...
- I knew the minute I drove up!

400
00:45:31,887 --> 00:45:35,675
- Listen to me. I have a place to go!
- Great. Awesome. Let's see this place.

401
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:38,759
- Should I drag you?
- No! No! No!

402
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:41,837
What the fuck, man?
What's going on?

403
00:45:41,927 --> 00:45:44,122
Are you using again?

404
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:53,685
I have a place.
A nice place.

405
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:55,917
I can't explain it to you.
Just trust me.

406
00:45:56,007 --> 00:46:00,159
<i>- Trust me, man!
- I know! I do!</i>

407
00:46:00,247 --> 00:46:04,365
It's funny? You make me feel like a moron
for ever caring what happens to you.

408
00:46:04,447 --> 00:46:08,201
- Don't feel like a moron.
- Fuck you, man. Fuck you!

409
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:11,040
- Let's go see this place now. Come on.
- No! No!

410
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:13,118
You can't see it.
I... It's...

411
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:17,678
- What, is it a place only you can see?
- No. It's messy!

412
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:21,476
- It's messy?
- Yeah. It's a mess.

413
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:28,040
I talk to you about everything,
and I'm always, always honest with you.

414
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:30,516
- Eric.
- No. You don't wanna talk to me,

415
00:46:30,607 --> 00:46:33,405
I don't wanna talk to you. Over.
Go sleep on the beach.

416
00:46:33,487 --> 00:46:37,526
Get fucked in the ass all night long,
cos I don't care any more, man. Done.

417
00:46:37,607 --> 00:46:40,405
- Eric!
- No, I'm going home.

418
00:46:47,447 --> 00:46:51,042
I haven't masturbated in a long time.

419
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:53,595
I'm getting really sick of you.

420
00:46:56,967 --> 00:46:59,435
- Annie Sprinkle?
- Yeah.

421
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:00,846
Um...

422
00:47:00,927 --> 00:47:04,317
She does really great pro-women stuff,
apparently.

423
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:07,444
Eric gave this to me. I should have
watched it a long time ago.

424
00:47:07,527 --> 00:47:10,166
- What's it called?
- Um...

425
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:11,839
<i>Zen ussy.</i>

426
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:14,964
There's, uh, 11 different girls.

427
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:18,316
No penises, so you'll like it.

428
00:47:33,607 --> 00:47:36,599
It's just extreme close-ups of vaginas?

429
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:41,355
Fast-forward.
See if there's anything else on here.

430
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:46,324
Mm.

431
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:49,763
Oh, fucking!
Turn it off!

432
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:52,486
- Should I?
- Yeah. Fuck!

433
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:54,523
OK. I thought, uh...

434
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:58,998
That was... Oh, Jesus. Fuck!
That was so fucked up. I'm about to cry.

435
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:01,601
- That was just, like, gynaecological.
- Ooh!

436
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:04,562
"11 vulvas. "

437
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:08,196
I... I really think you'll like it.

438
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:12,237
So what's the deal?
Is it porn?

439
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:14,045
Uh...

440
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:18,837
I don't wanna spoil it.
Just take it home. You'll love it.

441
00:48:18,927 --> 00:48:20,565
OK.

442
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,115
I trust your judgement.

443
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:26,483
So what's, um...

444
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:29,035
what's the deal with you and Eric?

445
00:48:30,047 --> 00:48:33,596
- He's not talking to me.
- Yeah.

446
00:48:33,687 --> 00:48:35,723
Why?

447
00:48:35,807 --> 00:48:38,196
Uh... You should just ask him.

448
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:45,558
You're not really that easy to talk to.
You should know that.

449
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:53,761
- It's playing next door, I think.
- At the Nuart, yeah. Yeah.

450
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:57,840
I was thinking,
since she liked Kieslowski so much,

451
00:48:57,927 --> 00:49:01,840
and I know you wouldn't want to
go see the film alone, and...

452
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:08,196
If we all went with you, it might be a little
bit better for you, man. Maybe make you...

453
00:49:08,287 --> 00:49:12,075
Derek, are you saying you want to
see a Kieslowski film with me?

454
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:15,204
- That's so romantic.
- Is there a midnight movie?

455
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:19,121
Maybe. Hey, we should all go.
What the hell?

456
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,516
- Yeah?
- Let's go check it out.

457
00:49:21,607 --> 00:49:25,964
Yeah. Let's go check it right now.
Uh, you guys need anything?

458
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:29,835
Hey, hang on.
I'll go get some smokes with you.

459
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:36,201
What, are you scared
to be alone with me?

460
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:50,723
Uh, hey, it's me.
Um...

461
00:49:50,807 --> 00:49:53,924
Listen, at midnight
they're playing a Kieslowski film,

462
00:49:54,007 --> 00:49:56,726
and I just wanted to see
if you wanted to come.

463
00:49:56,807 --> 00:50:01,961
It's gonna be really good,
so, um... come meet all the dudes.

464
00:50:02,047 --> 00:50:05,517
All right. Hopefully I'll see you there.
It's at midnight. Bye.

465
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:10,325
- Where's dinner?
- Huh?

466
00:51:11,287 --> 00:51:15,644
I thought you were gonna
bring pizza tonight. Mushrooms.

467
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:18,195
I don't wanna eat pizza
in the middle of the night.

468
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:21,484
- Well, I do.
- Well, you should get on that.

469
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:27,239
Why didn't you answer the phone
when I called?

470
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:30,399
- I was sleeping.
- Liar.

471
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:36,360
I called you a trillion different times, I left
you messages. I know you heard them.

472
00:51:36,447 --> 00:51:39,883
What's your problem?
Why don't you want to meet my friends?

473
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:44,085
I don't have family here.
They're like my family.

474
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:47,443
You're so whiny and clingy and needy

475
00:51:47,527 --> 00:51:49,722
and annoying.

476
00:51:51,447 --> 00:51:55,440
What if I died,
and you had ignored my calls?

477
00:51:57,207 --> 00:51:59,323
I'm not having this conversation.

478
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,717
You're never having any conversation.
You never talk to anyone.

479
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:07,119
You ignore my calls,
you ignore your father's calls.

480
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,516
I'm glad it's across the board,
not just me.

481
00:52:09,607 --> 00:52:12,679
You ignore the guy
who delivers your water!

482
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:17,158
I want you to meet Eric and the dudes,
OK? I want to meet your dad.

483
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:19,442
Who the fuck do you think you are?

484
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:24,726
I don't give a shit about you.
When are you gonna figure that out?

485
00:52:28,047 --> 00:52:30,038
I am your boyfriend.

486
00:52:32,007 --> 00:52:36,478
What a fucked-up boyfriend-girlfriend
situation this would be.

487
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:40,162
We don't have sex.
I don't even like you.

488
00:52:42,487 --> 00:52:45,320
- What happened to you?
- What?

489
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,198
Were you raped?

490
00:52:50,007 --> 00:52:52,601
<i>No.
Were you raped?</i>

491
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:57,835
Were you assaulted?
Has anyone ever hurt you like that?

492
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:00,357
No.

493
00:53:03,887 --> 00:53:06,401
I love you.

494
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:13,477
Just meet my friends.
They are the nicest guys.

495
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:16,559
You should find a girl
who can do that with you.

496
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:21,402
A girl you can fuck like a punching bag
whenever you want.

497
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:25,480
What?
It's a great solution to our problem.

498
00:53:25,567 --> 00:53:29,162
- What is our problem?
- You're disruptive.

499
00:53:30,527 --> 00:53:33,758
- What do you mean?
- You're disrupting my whole life.

500
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:37,726
What life?! What do you do?
You don't do anything!

501
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:42,005
- Maybe I should start writing my memoir.
- Why are you always so pissed off?

502
00:53:42,087 --> 00:53:45,762
- Just come out with my friends.
- I can't.

503
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,315
- It's simple. You just come.
- No!

504
00:53:48,407 --> 00:53:50,398
I can't!

505
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:10,723
- I don't know, man. Is it like a yoga thing?
- Uh-uh. Just take it home. You'll like it.

506
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:13,765
It's a great title.

507
00:54:13,847 --> 00:54:18,762
So I, uh, just talked to Eric.
He wouldn't talk about what's going on.

508
00:54:18,847 --> 00:54:22,840
- This shit happens with friends.
- No, not with them.

509
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,487
Something's really wrong.

510
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:29,640
- What do you think happened?
- I don't know, man. Must be huge, though.

511
00:54:29,727 --> 00:54:33,322
This is unprecedented behaviour
for them.

512
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,480
- Shit.
- I know.

513
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:45,596
That's a clit, by the way.

514
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:54,519
You're a little kid.
You work in a video store.

515
00:54:54,607 --> 00:54:59,556
You don't have money for rent. You
don't have money for gas. It's pathetic.

516
00:54:59,647 --> 00:55:02,844
- Me having no money?
- Yes.

517
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:06,920
You're a piece-of-shit excuse
for a person.

518
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:10,443
Well, I think it's pathetic to piss away
every day not doing a thing

519
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:16,318
except watching girls who are underpaid
and exploited rub up against each other.

520
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:19,205
Well, I'm sorry. I jerk off, too.
Live with it.

521
00:55:19,287 --> 00:55:22,484
I would love to live with it.
That's my point.

522
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:24,558
Shut up.

523
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:28,999
Listen.
It is really fucking hard, OK?

524
00:55:29,087 --> 00:55:32,966
I'm doing better than most. You don't
have to be so heartless all the time.

525
00:55:33,047 --> 00:55:36,357
- You're a scrounger.
- I have a job.

526
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,597
I have a job, at least.
What the fuck do you do?

527
00:55:38,687 --> 00:55:41,679
You have a shit job.

528
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:44,042
You have money.

529
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,846
You could be studying
anywhere on the planet, but no.

530
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:50,397
Hanging art on your wall that Daddy
got you as a present isn't a job.

531
00:55:50,487 --> 00:55:54,526
<i>You have a shit job, and people do hang
art for a living. They're called curators.</i>

532
00:55:54,607 --> 00:55:57,201
I know what a fucking curator is.

533
00:55:58,487 --> 00:56:01,160
There is no reason
for you not to be with me.

534
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:03,477
You're searching.
It takes time.

535
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:06,479
We can do it gently.
We can go slowly.

536
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:10,401
Guide me - however you want. Remember
we talked about the vaginal dilator?

537
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:13,047
You're sexually deformed.
Do you want to live here?

538
00:56:13,127 --> 00:56:15,357
Yes!
I wanna be with you!

539
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:18,041
Do you want me to buy you
a mink coat and some diamonds?

540
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:21,756
You're not staying here and fucking me.
I won't let you!

541
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:26,443
- I don't need your money!
- Well, we both know that's not true.

542
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:33,325
Nothing you can say
can hurt my feelings.

543
00:56:33,407 --> 00:56:39,403
- What's the point of saying anything?
- I love you. This fight is over with.

544
00:56:43,647 --> 00:56:47,845
I think you should take the vaginal dilator
and use it in your butt.

545
00:56:47,927 --> 00:56:51,124
Get your dork friends to help.
Get out!

546
00:56:52,687 --> 00:56:56,157
I'm staying here tonight, in your bed.

547
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:59,717
I am touching you,
and you're going to try it.

548
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:02,002
End of discussion.

549
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:13,399
What are you doing?
Who are you calling?

550
00:57:14,327 --> 00:57:19,276
Give me the phone. This is not domestic
violence! This is not a police matter!

551
00:57:19,367 --> 00:57:25,363
You're clogging up the line for people
who are really in trouble. Selfish as usual.

552
00:57:29,327 --> 00:57:34,526
- You can't go to sleep. It's 4:30.
- I'm sleeping here.

553
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:36,598
OK.

554
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:40,726
- Hey! Rape! Help!
- Shut up. I'm not raping you.

555
00:57:40,807 --> 00:57:44,117
- Rape!
- You wish. You wish I... Shut up!

556
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,082
Get me my book.

557
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:59,557
- Where is it?
- In the bedroom, on the dresser.

558
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:08,961
- Come and get it.
- Give it to me.

559
00:58:22,487 --> 00:58:24,876
<i>Just this, please.</i>

560
00:58:27,487 --> 00:58:29,682
Sure thing, Charlie.

561
00:58:33,967 --> 00:58:36,356
Place looks good.

562
00:58:38,687 --> 00:58:42,726
- Are you boys in love?
- Sorry, Charlie?

563
00:58:42,807 --> 00:58:46,959
<i>Love. Amour. Dancing.</i>

564
00:58:47,047 --> 00:58:50,926
Are you in love?
It's no use wasting away alone.

565
00:58:51,367 --> 00:58:54,803
You need it. Fall in love.

566
00:58:55,247 --> 00:58:56,521
Sure.

567
00:58:56,607 --> 00:59:00,077
Fall in love quick.
With a girl or a boy.

568
00:59:02,007 --> 00:59:04,077
Find someone.

569
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:08,080
<i>- Thank you. We will.
- That's great advice, sir.</i>

570
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:13,843
- You know what today is?
- It's your anniversary.

571
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:16,521
Yeah. She loved this film.

572
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:24,484
- Don't... don't forget your tape, there.
- Oh, yes. Yes. Yes.

573
00:59:31,007 --> 00:59:33,202
I mean it, boys.

574
00:59:35,287 --> 00:59:37,482
Make it snappy.

575
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:40,796
You're getting old.

576
00:59:44,567 --> 00:59:46,797
See you.

577
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:49,685
- Ah, thank you.
- Thank you, Charlie.

578
00:59:49,767 --> 00:59:53,760
<i>- See you next time.
- You bet. Take care.</i>

579
01:01:01,887 --> 01:01:06,483
So, anyway, I think,
as a general rule,

580
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:09,684
if you committed yourself

581
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:13,157
to watching a sexual film
of a higher quality,

582
01:01:13,247 --> 01:01:15,124
um...

583
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:17,960
meaning psychologically sexual -

584
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:21,198
uh, European, thoughtful...

585
01:01:21,287 --> 01:01:25,166
I'm never gonna have sex with you.
I'm frigid.

586
01:01:25,247 --> 01:01:27,602
- Are you a virgin?
- No. I'm not.

587
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:29,120
<i>Bless you.</i>

588
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:31,846
- You're not frigid.
- How would you know?

589
01:01:31,927 --> 01:01:35,397
Good sex isn't dumb or cheap
like the sex in porn.

590
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:38,160
Thank you.
I'm not a dumb-ass.

591
01:01:38,887 --> 01:01:45,235
OK. Well, the stuff I'm going to bring over
will actually make you want

592
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:49,081
to think about having real sex.

593
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:51,044
Loving sex.

594
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:55,325
I've had a lot of sex.
I know what I'm doing.

595
01:01:55,407 --> 01:01:57,796
Yeah, I bet you do.

596
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:03,960
You know, you're...
you're so ugly.

597
01:02:06,127 --> 01:02:10,200
- Well, I know you find me attractive.
- Not at all.

598
01:02:10,287 --> 01:02:13,165
Why don't you sleep in
your aunt's old apartment tonight?

599
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:19,004
Her old apartment freaks me out.
I know you find me attractive.

600
01:02:19,087 --> 01:02:23,763
If I wanted to have sex,
I would go find someone sexy.

601
01:02:23,847 --> 01:02:26,236
- Not like you.
- So you don't think I'm sexy?

602
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,761
I don't like your face.

603
01:02:28,847 --> 01:02:31,645
Well, it's not your face
I like the most, either.

604
01:02:31,727 --> 01:02:37,040
You're disgusting to me. The thought
of your penis is even more disgusting.

605
01:02:37,127 --> 01:02:41,040
When have you ever seen a dick
that looked nice or smelled nice?

606
01:02:41,127 --> 01:02:45,040
You should feel ashamed.
Limp or erect, it's sick.

607
01:02:48,087 --> 01:02:50,237
You said "dick".
You never say "dick".

608
01:02:50,327 --> 01:02:52,477
- Asshole.
- I think my dick looks nice.

609
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:54,956
That's because you're an idiot.

610
01:03:04,887 --> 01:03:06,878
Aah!

611
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:16,566
You like this?
Is this what you want?

612
01:03:16,647 --> 01:03:19,036
I'll take what I can get.

613
01:03:21,847 --> 01:03:25,078
You'll take whatever I give you, huh?

614
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:27,556
I'll take whatever you give me.

615
01:03:28,927 --> 01:03:31,316
I'll take it.

616
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:12,038
Oh, fuck!

617
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:14,322
I hate you!

618
01:04:15,287 --> 01:04:18,882
- I couldn't help it.
- Get out, you fucking... Aargh!

619
01:04:18,967 --> 01:04:23,085
No, it just happened. I wasn't gonna
do anything with it. You're beautiful.

620
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:25,397
- It's biology!
- Sicko fucking pervert!

621
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:29,275
- Biology. I wasn't gonna do anything.
- I can't believe I let you in my bed!

622
01:04:29,367 --> 01:04:32,359
The sounds you were making were sexy.
I wouldn't do anything!

623
01:04:32,447 --> 01:04:35,803
Now it could happen any time!
You said you wouldn't!

624
01:04:35,887 --> 01:04:38,879
- No. It's gone now! It's gone now!
- It's gone now?

625
01:04:38,967 --> 01:04:41,356
No, no! It's gone!
So you can stop stressing.

626
01:04:41,447 --> 01:04:44,439
I'm stressed!
I can't trust you now, you fuck.

627
01:04:48,327 --> 01:04:50,318
Pervert!

628
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:54,122
Stop. Stop.
I don't want to do this.

629
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:58,723
I can go back to just kissing the right
thigh. I can kiss your thighs all day.

630
01:05:58,807 --> 01:06:01,002
- We can...
- Get up!

631
01:06:05,207 --> 01:06:09,997
That was great. Step by step. That was
just what I was talking about. We can...

632
01:06:10,087 --> 01:06:13,045
I want you to leave.

633
01:06:13,127 --> 01:06:14,640
Huh?

634
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:18,037
I'm never seeing you again.
It's over.

635
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,839
What are you talking about?
This was good. This was progress.

636
01:06:22,927 --> 01:06:25,202
Leave, or I'll scream.

637
01:06:25,287 --> 01:06:27,164
- But...
- Leave. Leave.

638
01:06:27,247 --> 01:06:30,080
- No.
- Leave! Leave! Leave!

639
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:33,125
- Leave! Leave! Leave!
- Don't do this. It's OK, it's OK.

640
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:36,882
- Leave! Leave!
- Please, please. We can figure this out.

641
01:06:36,967 --> 01:06:40,118
<i>Leave, leave,
leave, leave, leave, leave.</i>

642
01:06:40,207 --> 01:06:42,721
- Oh, no, no, no. It's...
- Leave!

643
01:06:42,807 --> 01:06:45,082
Leave!

644
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,840
- OK. I'm going.
- Leave! Leave!

645
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:33,683
- Just this, then?
- Yeah, just that.

646
01:09:03,847 --> 01:09:07,203
<i>- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.</i>

647
01:09:07,287 --> 01:09:10,484
<i>- Have a good night.
- You too.</i>

648
01:09:16,567 --> 01:09:18,762
- Hello.
- Hello.

649
01:12:09,047 --> 01:12:11,686
Hey, baby.
How are you?

650
01:12:11,767 --> 01:12:13,758
Nice.

651
01:12:14,967 --> 01:12:17,117
I'm sorry to bother you.
I know you're busy.

652
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:20,916
No, you don't bother me. I wish
you stopped up here more often.

653
01:12:21,007 --> 01:12:23,646
I just wanted to talk to you
because...

654
01:12:23,727 --> 01:12:26,287
uh, I have a job.
I mean, I have a job.

655
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:29,165
I got a job. So...

656
01:12:29,247 --> 01:12:33,684
You got a job?
Oh, my God, that's so cute.

657
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:36,201
Yeah. I got a job.

658
01:12:37,247 --> 01:12:40,637
And I wanted you to know because
I know you bought the apartment,

659
01:12:40,727 --> 01:12:42,877
but I'm moving out.

660
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:48,405
Renting a smaller place.
Cos I'd... I'd like to live in a different place.

661
01:12:48,487 --> 01:12:50,079
- Uh...
- Right.

662
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:53,477
- Because I have a job now, so...
- Right.

663
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:56,162
What is your job?

664
01:12:57,207 --> 01:13:01,086
Oh, you want it to be a surprise?
Are you working at a restaurant?

665
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:07,083
Nah, you're probably a terrible waitress.
Is it a... is it a strip club?

666
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:11,365
Because you'll have to start
working out a little more if that's what it is.

667
01:13:11,447 --> 01:13:14,519
I don't wanna tell you
what it is or where it is.

668
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:17,167
It's just my job.

669
01:13:19,727 --> 01:13:25,006
So, you've decided to become
financially independent at 24?

670
01:13:27,527 --> 01:13:30,724
I guess you owe me
about three million dollars,

671
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:33,879
if you consider all the therapy
and the clothes.

672
01:13:34,527 --> 01:13:37,997
Listen, your apartment's paid for.
It's yours.

673
01:13:38,087 --> 01:13:42,763
Uh, I called Bob and told him to...

674
01:13:42,847 --> 01:13:44,997
well, he closed my account.

675
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,998
And, uh,

676
01:13:47,087 --> 01:13:49,647
here are the keys

677
01:13:49,727 --> 01:13:52,605
to the... to my... to the car.

678
01:13:54,367 --> 01:13:58,201
You've grown accustomed
to a certain lifestyle,

679
01:13:58,287 --> 01:14:02,405
and if you want to rough it for a while
with this job,

680
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:05,285
then I understand that, OK?

681
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:07,756
But you need to
keep your accounts open.

682
01:14:07,847 --> 01:14:12,682
I don't want your money any more, Dad.
I don't need it.

683
01:14:12,767 --> 01:14:15,042
Hey. Sit down and shut up.
I want you to li...

684
01:14:15,127 --> 01:14:19,166
Sit your ass down. Sit down!
You're being stupid.

685
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:22,956
I'm gonna talk to you
like an adult, for a change.

686
01:14:23,047 --> 01:14:25,845
Have you even considered...
health insurance?

687
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:28,487
If you want to move to
a different apartment, fine.

688
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:33,038
I'll have Jared find some places.
You just tell me the neighbourhood...

689
01:14:33,127 --> 01:14:36,676
I don't need to find a place.
I have a new place.

690
01:14:38,327 --> 01:14:42,843
- Where is it?
- If you try to find me, I'll call the cops.

691
01:14:49,607 --> 01:14:52,360
Sweetheart,

692
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:56,076
the cops don't give a shit
what you have to say.

693
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:58,840
They don't care about what happened.

694
01:15:00,527 --> 01:15:03,485
And don't ever, ever

695
01:15:03,567 --> 01:15:06,764
fucking threaten me again.

696
01:15:09,407 --> 01:15:11,523
Do you understand?

697
01:15:21,447 --> 01:15:25,440
I'll call the press.
I'll call your clients.

698
01:15:27,687 --> 01:15:33,444
I can go to Bob's office any time
and sign whatever you need me to sign.

699
01:15:33,527 --> 01:15:36,121
He has my email address.

700
01:15:37,687 --> 01:15:40,076
I don't love you.
