I have sailed the world



Beheld its wonders



From the Dardanelles
To the mountains of Peru



But there's no place like London



No, there's no place like London



Mr. Todd?



You are young
Life has been kind to you



You will learn



There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit



And the vermin of the world inhabit it



And its morals aren't worth
What a pig could spit



And it goes by the name of London



At the top of the hole
Sit a privileged few



Making mock of the vermin
In the lower zoo



Turning beauty into filth and greed
I too



Have sailed the world
And seen its wonders



For the cruelty of men
Is as wondrous as Peru



But there's no place like London



Is everything all right, Mr. Todd?



I beg your indulgence, Anthony.



My mind is far from easy.



In these once-familiar streets,
I feel shadows...



- ...everywhere.
- Shadows?



Ghosts.



There was a barber and his wife



And she was beautiful



A foolish barber and his wife



She was his reason and his life



And she was beautiful



And she was virtuous



And he was



Naive



There was another man who saw



That she was beautiful



A pious vulture of the law



Who, with a gesture of his claw



Removed the barber from his plate



Then there was nothing but to wait



And she would fall



So soft, so young, so lost



And, oh, so beautiful



And the lady, sir, did she succumb?



Oh, that was many years ago



I doubt if anyone would know



I'd like to thank you, Anthony.



If you hadn't spotted me,
I'd be lost on the ocean still.



Will I see you again?



You might find me if you like.



Around Fleet Street,
I wouldn't wonder.



Until then, my friend.



There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit



And it's filled with people
Who are filled with shit



And the vermin of the world inhabit it



A customer!



Wait! What's your rush?



What's your hurry?



You gave me such a fright
I thought you was a ghost!



Half a minute, can't you sit?
Sit you down. Sit!



All I meant is that I haven't
Seen a customer for weeks



Did you come here for a pie, sir?



Do forgive me
If me head's a little vague



What is that?



But you'd think we had the plague
From the way that people keep avoiding



No, you don't.



Heaven knows I try, sir



But there's no one
Comes in even to inhale



Right you are, sir
Would you like a drop of ale?



Mind you, I can hardly blame them



These are probably
The worst pies in London



I know why nobody cares to take them



I should know, I make 'em
But good? No



The worst pies in London



Even that's polite
The worst pies in London



If you doubt it, take a bite



Is that just disgusting?
You have to concede it



It's nothing but crusting



Here, drink this, you'll need it
The worst pies in London



And no wonder, with the price of meat
What it is, when you get it



Never thought I'd live to see the day
Men'd think it was a treat



Findin' poor animals
What are dyin' in the street



Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop



Does a business
But I noticed something weird



Lately all her neighbors' cats
Have disappeared



Have to hand it to her
What I calls enterprise



Poppin' pussies into pies



Wouldn't do in my shop



Just the thought of it's
Enough to make you sick



And I'm tellin' you
Them pussycats is quick



No denying times is hard, sir



Even harder than
The worst pies in London



Only lard and nothing more
Is that just revolting?



All greasy and gritty



It looks like it's molting



And tastes like



Well, pity A woman alone



With limited wind



And the worst pies in London



Ah, sir, times is hard



Times is hard



Trust me, dearie, it's gonna take a lot
more than ale to wash that taste out.



Come with me.
We'll get you a nice tumbler of gin, eh?



LOVETT: Isn't this homey, now?



The cheery wallpaper
was a real bargain too.



It was only partly singed when the
chapel burned down. There you go.



You sit down, warm your bones.



You got a room over the shop here.



Times is so hard,
why don't you rent it out?



What, up there?
No, no one will go near it.



People think it's haunted.



- Haunted?
- Yeah.



And who's to say they're wrong?



You see, years ago,
something happened up there.



Something not very nice.



There was a barber and his wige



And he was beautiful



A proper artist with a knife



But they transported him for life



And he was beautiful



Barker, his name was.
Benjamin Barker.



What was his crime?



Foolishness.



He had this wife, you see



Pretty little thing, silly little nit



Had her chance
For the moon on a string



Poor thing



There was this judge, you see



Wanted her like mad
Every day he sent her a flower



But did she come down
From her tower?



Sat up there
And sobbed by the hour



Poor fool



Ah, but there was worse yet to come
Poor thing



Well, beadle calls on her, all polite



Poor thing, poor thing



The judge, he tells her, is all contrite



He blames himselg
For her dreadful plight



She must come straight
To his house tonight



Poor thing, poor thing



Of course, when she goes there
Poor thing, poor thing



They're having this ball all in masks



There's no one she knows there
Poor dear, poor thing



She wanders, tormented, and drinks
Poor thing



The judge has repented, she thinks
Poor thing



"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?" she asks



He was there, all right
Only not so contrite



She wasn't no match gor such craft
You see



And everyone thought it so droll



They figured she had to be daft
You see



So all of them stood there and laughed
You see



Poor soul



Poor thing



SWEENEY: No!



Would no one have mercy on her?



So it is you...



...Benjamin Barker.



Where is Lucy?



Where is my wife?



She poisoned herself.



Arsenic, from the apothecary
around the corner.



I tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't listen to me.



And he's got your daughter.



He?



Judge Turpin?



Adopted her. Like his own.



Fifteen years...



...sweating in a living hell
on a false charge.



Fifteen years dreaming I might
come home to a wife and child.



I can't say the years have been
particularly kind to you, Mr. Barker.



No. Not Barker.



That man is dead.



It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd.



And he will have his revenge.



Come in.



Nothing to be afraid of, love.



When they came for the girl,
I hid them.



Could've sold them, but I didn't.



Those handles is chased silver,
ain't they?



Silver. Yes.



These are my friends



See how they glisten



See this one shine



How he smiles in the light



My friend



My faithful friend



Speak to me, friend



Whisper, I'll listen



I know, I know



You've been locked out of sight
All these years



Like me, my friend



Well, I've come home



To find you waiting



Home



And we're together



And we'll do wonders



Won't we?



You there, my friend



- I'm your friend too, Mr. Todd
- Come, let me hold you



- If you only knew, Mr. Todd
- Now, with a sigh



- Oh, Mr. Todd, you're warm in my hand
- You grow warm in my hand



- My friend
- You've come home



- My clever friend
- Always had a fondness for you, I did



Rest now, my friends



- Never you fear, Mr. Todd
- Soon I'll unfold you



- You can move in here, Mr. Todd
- Soon you'll know



- Splendors you never have dreamed
- Splendors you never have dreamed



- All your days
- All your days will be yours



My lucky friends



- I'm your friend and now you're mine
- Till now your shine



- Don't they shine beautiful?
- Was merely silver



- Silver's good enough for me, Mr. T.
- Friends



You shall drip rubies



You'll soon drip



Precious rubies



Leave me.



At last...



...my arm is complete again.



Greenfinch and linnet bird



Nightingale, blackbird



How is it you sing?



How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages



Never taking wing?



Outside, the sky waits
Beckoning, beckoning



Just beyond the bars



How can you remain
Staring at the rain



Maddened by the stars?



How is it you sing anything?



How is it you sing?



My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark



Nothing there sings
Not even my lark



Larks never will, you know
When they're captive



Teach me to be more adaptive



Greenfinch and linnet bird
Nightingale, blackbird



Teach me how to sing



If I cannot fly



Let me sing



BEGGAR WOMAN: Alms



Alms gor a miserable woman



On a miserable chilly morning



Thank you, sir!



Ma'am? Could you tell me
whose house this is?



Uh, that's the great
Judge Turpin's house, that is.



And the young lady who resides there?



Oh, that's Johanna...



...his pretty little ward.



Keeps her snug, he does.
All locked up.



So don't you go trespassing there...



...or it's a good whipping for you...



...or any other young man
with mischief on his mind.



Alms



Alms for a desperate woman



I feel you, Johanna



I feel you



I was half convinced I'd waken



Satisfied enough to dream you



Happily I was mistaken, Johanna



I'll steal you, Johanna



I'll steal you



Come in, lad. Come in.



You were looking for Hyde Park,
you say?



Yes.



It's very large on the map,
but I keep getting lost.



Sit down, lad, sit down.



It's embarrassing for a sailor to lose
his bearings, but, uh, there you are.



A sailor?



Yes, sir.
The Bountiful, out of Plymouth.



A sailor must know
the ways of the world, yes?



Must be practiced
in the ways of the world.



Would you say
you were practiced, boy?



Sir?



Oh, yes.



Such practices.



The geishas of Japan.
The concubines of Siam.



The catamites of Greece.
The harlots of India.



I have them all here.
Drawings of them.



Everything you've ever
dreamed of doing...



...with a woman.



Would you like to see?



I think there's been some mistake.



I think not.



You gandered at my ward, Johanna.



You gandered at her.



- Yes, sir, you gandered.
- I meant no harm.



Your meaning is immaterial.



Mark me.



If I see your face
again on this street...



...you'll rue the day you were born.



BEADLE:
Hyde Park is that way, young sir!



A left and a right and straight on,
you see?



Move on, now!



You heard what Judge Turpin said,
little man.



Next time, it'll be your pretty little brains
all over the pavement.



I'll steal you, Johanna



I'll steal you



Do they think that walls can hide you?



Even now I'm at your window



I am in the dark beside you



Buried sweetly in your yellow hair



I feel you, Johanna



And one day I'll steal you



Till I'm with you then
I'm with you there



Sweetly buried in your yellow hair



He's here every Thursday.
Italian. All the rage, he is.



Best barber in London, they say.



Hang on.



Ladies and gentlemen



May I have your attention, please?



Do you wake every morning
In shame and despair



To discover your pillow
Is covered with hair?



What ought not to be there



Well, ladies and gentlemen
From now on, you can waken at ease



You need never again
Have a worry or care



I will show you
A miracle marvelous rare



Gentlemen, you are about to see
Something what rose from the dead



On the top of my head



'Twas Pirelli's Miracle Elixir



That's what did the trick, sir
True, sir, true



Was it quick, sir?
Did it in a tick, sir



Just like an elixir
Ought to do



How about a bottle, mister?



Only costs a penny, guaranteed



Does Pirelli's
Stimulate the growth, sir?



You can have my oath, sir
'Tis unique



Rub a minute
Stimulatin', innit?



Soon you'll have to thin it
Once a week



Pardon me, ma'am
What's that awful stench?



LOVETT:
Are we standing near an open trench?



- Must be standing near an open trench
- Pardon me, what's that awful stench?



Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir



Anything what's slick, sir
Soon sprouts curls



Try Pirelli's
When they see how thick, sir



You can have your pick, sir
Of the girls



Wanna buy a bottle, missus?



- What is this?
- What is this?



- Smells like piss
- Smells like... Ew!



SWEENEY: Looks like piss
- Wouldn't touch it if I was you, dear



This is piss Piss with ink



Let Pirelli's activate your roots, sir



Keep it off your boots, sir
Eats right through



Yes, get Pirelli's, use a bottle of it
Ladies seem to love it



Flies do too



I am Adolfo Pirelli



The king of the barbers
The barber of kings



E buon giorno, good day
I blow you a kiss



And I



The so-famous Pirelli
I wish to know



Who has the nerve to say



My elixir is piss



Who says this?



I do.



I'm Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street.



I've opened a bottle of Pirelli's Elixir.



And I say to you that
it is nothing but an arrant fraud...



...concocted from piss and ink.



Furthermore, signor...



...I have serviced no kings...



...yet I wager that I can shave a cheek
with 10 times more dexterity...



...than any street mountebank.



Do you see these razors?



I lay them against 5 pound...



...you are no match, sir.



Either accept my challenge...



...or reveal yourself as a sham.



You hear this foolish man?



Now, please, you will see how
he will regret his folly.



Toby!



Who's for a free shave?



Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?



Glad, as always,
to oblige my friends and neighbors.



- Ready?
- Ready.



Ready.



The fastest, smoothest shave
is the winner!



Now, signorine, signori



We mix the lather



But first you gather around
Signorine, signori



You looking a man



Who have had the glory
To shave the pope



Mr. Sweeney, whoever
I beg your pardon



You'll probably say it was only a cardinal
Nope!



It was the pope!



To shave the face
To cut the hair



Require the grace
Require the flair



For if you slip
You nick the skin



You clip the chin
You rip the lip a bit beyond repair



To shave the face



Or even a part
Without it smart



Require the heart



Not just the flash



It take panache
It take the passion for the art



To shave the face
To trim the beard



To make the bristle
Clean like a whistle



This is from early infancy
The talent give to me



By God



It take the skill
It take the brains



It take the will
To take the pains



It take the pace



It take the grace



The winner is Todd!



Sir, I bow to a skill
far greater than my own.



The 5 pound.



May the good Lord smile on you...



...until we meet again.



Come, boy. Come!



I suppose it's just me gentle heart, but
I do hate to see a boy treated like that.



MAN:
Congratulations, Mr. Todd.



May I ask you, sir,
do you have your own establishment?



He certainly does.



Sweeney Todd's Tonsorial Parlor, above
my Meat Pie Emporium in Fleet Street.



SWEENEY: I thank you, sir.



You are a paragon of integrity.



Well, I try to do my best
for my friends and neighbors.



Your establishment is in Fleet Street,
you say?



Yes, sir.



Then, Mr. Todd, you shall surely
see me there before the week is out.



You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford.



And I can guarantee to give you,
without a penny's charge...



...the closest shave you will ever know.



Come on, love.



It's not much of a chair, but it'll do.
It was me poor Albert's chair.



Sit in it all day long he did,
after his leg gave out with the gout.



Why doesn't the beadle come?



"Before the week is out,"
that's what he said.



Well, who says the week's out?
It's only Tuesday.



Easy, now



Hush, love, hush



Don't distress yourself
What's your rush?



Keep your thoughts
Nice and lush



Wait



Hush, love, hush
Think it through



Once it bubbles
Then what's to do?



Watch it close Let it brew



Wait



I've been thinking flowers



Maybe daisies
To brighten up the room



Don't you think some flowers
Pretty daisies



Might relieve the gloom?



Ah, wait



Love, wait



And the judge?
When'll we get to him?



LOVETT:
Can't you think of nothing else?



Always brooding away
on your wrongs...



...and what happened heaven knows
how many years ago. Come on.



Slow, love, slow
Time's so fast



Now goes quickly
See, now it's passed



Soon will come Soon will last



Wait



Don't you know Silly man



Half the fun
Is to plan the plan?



All good things
Come to those who can



Wait



Gillyflowers, maybe
'Stead of daisies



I don't know, though
What do you think?



Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me.



Mrs. Lovett, sir.



A pleasure, ma'am.



Mr. Todd, there's a girl
who needs my help.



Such a sad girl and lonely,
but beautiful too.



- Slow down, son.
- Yes. I'm sorry.



This girl's guardian
keeps her locked away...



...but then this morning
she dropped this.



Surely a sign that Johanna
wants me to help her.



That's her name, Johanna.
And Turpin is her guardian.



He's a judge of some sort. Once he
goes to court, I'll slip into the house...



...release her and beg her
to come away with me.



- Oh, this is very romantic.
- Yes.



But I don't know anyone
in London, you see.



And I need somewhere safe to bring her
till I've hired a coach to take us away.



If I could keep her here just for an hour
or two, I'd be forever in your debt.



Bring her here, love.



Thank you, ma'am.



Mr. Todd?



Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you,
my friend. Thank you, ma'am.



Seems like the Fates
are favoring you at last, Mr. T.



SWEENEY: Hm.



What is it? You'll have her back
before the day's out.



- What about him?
- Him?



Oh, well. Let him bring her here.



And then, since you're
so hot for a little:



That's the throat to slit, my dear.



Poor little Johanna.



All those years without
a scrap of motherly affection.



Well, I'll soon see to that.



LOVETT:
Hello. What's he doing here?



Keep the boy downstairs.



Signora, is Mr. Todd at home?



Plying his trade upstairs.



Ooh. Would you look at it, now?



You wouldn't mind if I gave it
a nice, juicy meat pie, would you?



Sì, sì, sì. Whatever you want.



Come on, lad.



Your teeth are strong, I hope.



Close the door.



Get you a nice, lovely pie.



Sit down. Make yourself comfy.



Come in.



Mr. Todd.



Signor Pirelli.



Call me Davey.



Davey Collins is the name
when it's not professional.



I'd like me 5 quid back,
if you don't mind.



Why?



Because you entered into our little wager
under false pretenses, my friend.



So that you might remember to be
a bit more forthright in the future...



...I'll be taking half your profits
from herewith. Share and share alike.



Mr. Benjamin Barker.



There we are.



Tuck in.



I like to see a man with a healthy
appetite. Reminds me of my dear Albert.



Liked to gorge himself
to bloatation, he did.



He didn't have your nice
head of hair, though.



To tell the truth, it gets awful hot.



Yes, this'll do nicely.



You don't remember me, do you?



Why should you?



I was just a little nipper you hired for
a couple of weeks, sweeping up hair.



But I remember these.



And how could I ever
forget you, Mr. Barker?



I used to sit right here...



...and dream of the day when I could be
a proper barber myself.



You might say that you was
inspiration to me.



So has we got a deal?



Or should I run down the street
to me old pal, Beadle Bamford?



What do you say to that now...



...Mr. Sweeney Todd?



My, my, my. Always work to be done.



Spic and span, that's my motto.



So, um, how'd you end up
with that dreadful Italian?



Got me from the workhouse.
Been there since I was born.



Oh, God. He's got an appointment with
his tailor. If he's late, he'll blame me.



Wait!



Signor, you've got an appointment.



Signor Pirelli's been called away.



Better run after him.



No, sir. I should stay here,
or it'll be a lashing.



He's a great one for the lashings.



So Mrs. Lovett give you a pie, did she?



She's a real lady.



That she is.



But if I know a growing boy,
there's still room for more pie, eh?



Yes, sir.



Then why don't you wait
for your master downstairs?



Be another pie in it for you, I'm sure.



No. I should stay here.



Tell you what.



Why don't you tell Mrs. Lovett...



...that I said to give you
a nice, big tot of gin?



Thank you, sir!



TURPIN:
This is the second time, sir...



...you have been brought
before this bench.



Though it is my earnest wish
ever to temper justice with mercy...



...your persistent dedication
to a life of crime...



...is an abomination
before God and man.



I therefore sentence you to hang
by the neck until you're dead...



...and may the Lord
have mercy on your soul.



Court is adjourned.



Thank you, Your Honor.
Just the sentence we wanted.



Was he guilty?



Well, if he didn't do it, he's surely
done something to warrant a hanging.



What man has not?



Sorry?



No matter. Come.



Walk home with me.



I have news for you, my friend.



In order to shield her
from the evils of this world...



...I have decided to marry
my dear Johanna.



Oh, sir, happy news indeed.



Strange, though.



When I offered myself to her,
she showed a certain...



...reluctance.



Excuse me, my lord



May I request, my lord



Permission, my lord, to speak?



Forgive me if I suggest, my lord



You're looking less than your best
My lord



There's powder upon your vest, my lord
And stubble upon your cheek



And ladies, my lord, are weak



Stubble, you say?



Well, perhaps I am a little
overhasty in the mornings.



Fret not, though, my lord
I know a place, my lord



A barber, my lord, of skill



Thus armed with a shaven face, my lord
Some eau de cologne to brace, my lord



And musk to enhance the chase, my lord
You'll dazzle the girl until



Until?



She bows to your every will



A barber?



Take me to him.



His name is Todd, my lord, and he is
the very last word in barbering.



You ought to slow down a bit, lad.
It'll go straight to your head.



They used to give it to us
in the workhouse so's we could sleep.



Not that you'd wanna sleep
in that place, ma'am.



Not with the things
what happened in the dark.



That's nice, dear. Think I'll just
pop in on Mr. Todd for a tick.



You all right there?



Leave the bottle.



Ooh, that lad is drinking me
out of house and home.



How long till Pirelli gets back?



He won't be back.



Mr. T, you didn't.



You're barking mad.



Killing a man what done you no harm.



He recognized me from the old days.



Tried to blackmail me.



Half me earnings.



Oh, well.
That's a different matter, then.



For a moment there,
I thought you'd lost your marbles.



Ew. All that blood.



Poor bugger.



Oh, well.



Well, waste not, want not.



So, um, what are we gonna do
about the boy, then?



Send him up.



Oh, we don't need to worry about him.
He's a simple thing.



Send him up!



Now, Mr. T,
surely one's enough for today.



Besides, I was thinking of hiring the lad
to help me around the shop.



Me poor knees
aren't what they used to be.



All right.



Of course, we're gonna have to stock up
on the gin. Boy drinks like a sailor.



The judge.



Get out.



Get out!



Mr. Todd?



At your service.



An honor to receive
your patronage, milord.



You know me, sir?



Who in this wide world
does not know the great Judge Turpin?



These premises are hardly prepossessing,
and yet the beadle tells me...



...you're the most accomplished
of all the barbers in the city.



That is gracious of him, sir.



What may I do for you today, sir?



A stylish trimming of the hair?



Soothing skin massage?



Sit, sir. Sit.



You see, sir, a man infatuate with love



Her ardent and eager slave



So fetch the pomade and pumice stone
And lend me a more seductive tone



A sprinkling, perhaps, of French cologne
But first, sir, I think



A shave



The closest I ever gave



You're in a merry mood today,
Mr. Todd.



'Tis your delight, sir, catching fire
From one man to the next



'Tis true, sir, love can still inspire
The blood to pound, the heart leap higher



- What more can man require?
- What more can man require?



- Than love, sir?
- More than love, sir



- What, sir?
- Women



- Ah, yes, women
- Pretty women



Now, then, my friend



Now to your purpose



Patience, enjoy it



- Revenge can't be taken in haste
- Make haste



- And if we wed you'll be commended, sir
- My lord



And who, may it be said
Is your intended, sir?



My ward



And pretty as a rosebud.



Pretty as her mother?



What? What was that?



Nothing, sir. Nothing.



May we proceed?



Pretty women



Fascinating



Sipping coffee



Dancing



Pretty women are a wonder



Pretty women



Sitting in the window



Or standing on the stair



Something in them
Cheers the air



Pretty women



Silhouetted



Stay within you



Glancing



Stay forever



Breathing lightly



Pretty women



- Pretty women
- Pretty women



- Blowing out their candles
- Blowing out their candles



- Or combing out their hair
- Combing out their hair



Then they leave



- Even when they leave
- Even when they leave you and vanish



- They somehow can still remain
- They still



- There with you, there with you
- Are there, they're there



- Pretty women
- Pretty women



- At their mirrors
- In their gardens



- Letter-writing, weather-watching
- Flower-picking



- How they make a man sing
- How they make a man sing



- Proof of heaven
- Proof of heaven



- As you're living
- As you're living



- Pretty women, sir!
- Pretty women, sir!



- Pretty women, yes!
- Pretty women, yes!



- Pretty women
- Pretty women



- All the pretty women
- Pretty women



Mr. Todd! I've seen Johanna and she
said she'd leave with me tonight.



You.



There is indeed a higher power,
to warn me thus in time.



Johanna, elope with you?



I'll make sure neither you nor any other
man shall ever set eyes on her again.



As for you, barber, it's all too clear
what company you keep.



Service them well and hold their custom,
for you'll have none of mine.



ANTHONY:
Mr. Todd, you have to help me.



- Out.
- Mr. Todd, please.



- Out. Out!
- Mr. Todd!



All this shouting and running about.
What's happened?



I had him.



The sailor busted in.
I saw them running down the stairs.



I had him!



His throat was bare beneath my hand



- There, there, dear. Calm down.
- No, I had him!



His throat was there
And he'll never come again



Easy, now Hush, love, hush



I keep telling you...



- When?
- What's your rush?



Why did I wait?
You told me to wait



Now he'll never come again



There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit



And it's filled with people
Who are filled with shit



And the vermin of the world inhabit it



But not for long



They all deserve to die



Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett
Tell you why



Because in all of the whole human race
Mrs. Lovett



There are two kinds of men
And only two



There's the one staying put
In his proper place



And the one with his foot
In the other one's face



Look at me, Mrs. Lovett, look at you



No, we all deserve to die



Even you, Mrs. Lovett, even I



Because the lives of the wicked
Should be made brief



For the rest of us
Death will be a relief



We all deserve to die



And I'll never see Johanna



No, I'll never hug my girl to me



Finished!



All right!
You, sir, how about a shave?



Come and visit
Your good friend Sweeney



You, sir, too, sir
Welcome to the grave



I will have vengeance



I will have salvation



Who, sir? You, sir?
No one's in the chair, come on, come on



Sweeney's waiting
I want you bleeders



You, sir. Anybody!
Gentlemen, now, don't be shy



Not one man, no, nor 10 men



Nor a hundred can assuage me



I will have you



And I will get him back
Even as he gloats



In the meantime
I'll practice on less honorable throats



And my Lucy lies in ashes



And I'll never see my girl again



But the work waits



I'm alive at last



And I'm full of joy



That's all very well,
but what are we gonna do about him?



Hello?



Do you hear me?



Come on.



Oh, you great useless thing.



Sit down.



There. Drink it down.



Now, we got a body
moldering away upstairs.



Now, what do you intend
we should do about that, then?



Later on, when it's dark...



...we'll take it to some secret place
and bury it.



Oh, yeah. Of course we could do that.



Don't suppose he's got any relatives
gonna come looking for him.



Seems a downright shame



Shame?



Seems an awful waste



Such a nice, plump frame
What's-his-name has



Had, has



Nor he can't be traced



Business needs a lift



Debts to be erased



Think of it as thrift, as a gift



If you get my drift



Seems an awful waste



I mean, with the price of meat
What it is



When you get it, if you get it



Ahh.



Good, you got it



Take, for instance
Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop



Business never better
Using only pussycats and toast



Now, a pussy's good for maybe
Six or seven at the most



And I'm sure they can't compare
As far as taste



- Mrs. Lovett, what a charming notion
- It does seem a waste



Eminently practical and yet appropriate
As always



Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived without you
All these years I'll never know



Lots of other gentlemen'll soon be
Coming for a shave, won't they?



- Think of all them pies
- How choice, how rare



For what's the sound of the world
Out there?



What, Mr. Todd, what, Mr. Todd?
What is that sound?



Those crunching noises
Pervading the air



Yes, Mr. Todd, yes, Mr. Todd
Yes, all around



It's man devouring man, my dear



- And who are we to deny it in here?
- And who are we to deny it in here?



These are desperate times,
Mrs. Lovett...



...and desperate measures
are called for.



Here we are, hot out of the oven.



What is that?



It's priest
Have a little priest



- Is it really good?
- Sir, it's too good, at least



Then again
They don't commit sins of the flesh



So it's pretty fresh



Awful lot of fat



Only where it sat



Haven't you got poet
Or something like that?



No, you see, the trouble with poet
Is how do you know it's deceased?



Try the priest



Lawyer's rather nice



SWEENEY: If it's for a price



Order something else, though, to follow
Since no one should swallow it twice



Anything that's lean?



Well, then, if you're British and loyal
You might enjoy Royal Marine



Anyway, it's clean



Though, of course
It tastes of wherever it's been



Is that squire on the fire?



Mercy, no, sir, look closer
You'll notice it's grocer



SWEENEY:
Looks thicker, more like vicar



No, it has to be grocer
It's green



The history of the world, my love



Save a lot of graves
Do a lot of relatives favors



Is those below serving those up above



Everybody shaves
So there should be plenty of flavors



How gratifying for once to know



- That those above
- That those above



- Will serve those down below
- Will serve those down below



What is that?



It's fop Finest in the shop



Or we have some shepherd's pie
Peppered with actual shepherd on top



And I've just begun



Here's the politician, so oily
It's served with a doily, have one



Put it on a bun



Well, you never know
If it's going to run



Try the friar
Fried, it's drier



No, the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy



Then actor It's compacter



Ah, but always arrives overdone



I'll come again when you have
judge on the menu.



Have charity towards the world
My pet



Yes, yes, I know, my love



We'll take the customers
That we can get



Highborn and low, my love



We'll not discriminate great from small



No, we'll serve anyone



- We'll serve anyone
- Meaning anyone



- And to anyone at all
- And to anyone at all



So it's true.



Sir, a gentleman knocks
before entering a lady's room.



Indeed he does, but I see no lady.



I told myself
that the sailor was lying...



...that my Johanna would never
betray me, never hurt me so.



Sir, I will leave this place.



I think that only appropriate.



Since you no longer find my company
to your liking...



...we shall provide you
with new lodgings.



Until this moment,
I have spared the rod.



But the ungrateful child
has broken my heart.



When you've learnt to appreciate what
you have, perhaps we shall meet again.



Until then...



...think on your sins.



No!



JOHANNA: No, please!



Johanna! Where are you taking her?
Tell me or I swear I'll...



You'd kill me, boy? Here I stand!



ANTHONY: Johanna!



I feel you, Johanna



I feel you



Do they think that walls can hide you?



Even now I'm at your window



I am in the dark beside you



Buried sweetly in your yellow hair



Johanna



And are you beautiful and pale



With yellow hair, like her?



I'd want you beautiful and pale



The way I've dreamed you were



- Johanna ANTHONY: Johanna



And if you're beautiful, what then?
With yellow hair like wheat



I think we shall not meet again
My little dove



My sweet Johanna



I'll steal you, Johanna



SWEENEY: Goodbye, Johanna



You're gone, and yet you're mine



I'm fine, Johanna



- I'm fine
- Johanna



Smoke! Smoke! Sign of the devil
Sign of the devil, city on fire



Witch! Witch! Smell it, sir, an evil smell
Every night at the vespers bell



Smoke that comes from
The mouth of hell



City on fire



Mischief! Mischief! Mischief!



And if I never hear your voice
My turtledove, my dear



I still have reason to rejoice
The way ahead is clear



Johanna



ANTHONY: I feel you
- And in that darkness when I'm blind



With what I can't forget



- Johanna
- It's always morning in my mind



My little lamb, my pet



Johanna



- You stay, Johanna
ANTHONY: Johanna



The way I've dreamed you are



Oh, look, Johanna, a star



Buried sweetly in your yellow hair



A shooting star



BEGGAR WOMAN: There! There!



Somebody, somebody
Look up there, didn't I tell you?



Smell that air City on fire



Quick, sir, run and tell
Warn 'em all of the witch's spell



There it is, there it is
The unholy smell



Tell it to the beadle and police as well
Tell 'em, tell 'em



Help! Fiend! City on fire



City on fire



Mischief! Mischief!



And though I'll think of you, I guess
Until the day I die



I think I miss you less and less



As every day goes by, Johanna



Johanna



And you'd be beautiful and pale
And look too much like her



If only angels could prevail
We'd be the way we were, Johanna



ANTHONY: I feel you, Johanna



Wake up, Johanna



Another bright red day



We learn, Johanna, to say



Goodbye



ANTHONY: I'll steal



You



Ladies and gentlemen



May I have your attention, please?



Are your nostrils aquiver
And tingling as well



At that delicate, luscious
Ambrosial smell?



Yes, they are, I can tell



Well, ladies and gentlemen
That aroma enriching the breeze



Is like nothing
Compared to its succulent source



The gourmets among you
Will tell you, of course



Ladies and gentlemen
You can't imagine the rapture in store



Just inside of this door



There you'll sample
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies



Savory and sweet pies, as you'll see



You who eat pies
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies



Conjure up the treat
Pies used to be



- Toby
- Coming



- Ale there
- Right, ma'am



LOVETT: Quick, now



Nice to see you, dearie
How have you been keeping?



Cor, me bones is weary
Toby, one for the gentleman



Hear the birdies cheeping
Helps to keep it cheery



Toby, throw the old woman out



What's my secret?
Frankly, dear, forgive my candor



Family secret
All to do with herbs



Things like being careful
With your coriander



That's what makes the gravy grander



TOBY & LOVETT:
Eat them slow and feel the crust



How thin I rolled it



Eat them slow
'Cause every one's a prize



Eat them slow, 'cause that's the lot
And now we've sold it



Come again tomorrow



LOVETT: Hold it



Bless my eyes



Fresh supplies



How about it, dearie?
Be there in a twinkling



Just confirms my theory Toby



God watches over us
Didn't have an inkling, positively eerie



Toby, throw the old woman out



LOVETT: Still gotta keep an eye
on household expenditure.



SWEENEY: Mm. LOVETT: Mmm.



Which isn't to say we couldn't get
taxidermy animals...



...bring a touch of gentility
to the place.



You know, a boar's head or two.



Mr. T? You listening to me?



Of course.



Then what did I just say?



There must be a way to the judge.



Judge. Always harping
on the bloody old judge.



We got a nice, respectable business
now. Money coming in regular-like.



And since we're careful
to pick and choose...



...strangers,
people who won't be missed...



...who's gonna catch on?



Ooh, Mr. Todd, I'm so happy



I could eat you up, I really could



You know what I'd like to do, Mr. Todd?
What I dream?



If the business stays as good
Where I'd really like to go



In a year or so
Don't you wanna know?



Of course.



Do you really wanna know?



Yes, I do.



By the sea, Mr. Todd
That's the life I covet



By the sea, Mr. Todd
Oh, I know you'd love it



You and me, Mr. T, we could be alone
In a house what we'd almost own



- Down by the sea
- Anything you say



Wouldn't that be smashing?



LOVETT:
Think how snug it'll be



Underneath our flannel



When it's just you and me
And the English Channel



In our cozy retreat
Kept all neat and tidy



We'll have chums over every Friday
By the sea



Don't you love the weather
By the sea?



We'll grow old together



By the seaside
By the beautiful sea



It'll be so quiet that who'll come by it
Except a seagull?



Hoo! Hoo!



We shouldn't try it, though
Till it's legal for two



But a seaside wedding
Could be devised



Me rumpled bedding legitimized



Me eyelids aflutter, I'll turn into butter
The moment I mutter "I do"



Do you take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?



You may kiss your bride.



Down by the sea
Married nice and proper



By the sea
Bring along your chopper



To the seaside
By the beautiful sea



Brought you some breakfast, dear.



Mr. T? Can I ask you a question?



What?



What did your Lucy look like?



Can't really remember, can you?



She had yellow hair.



You gotta leave this all
behind you now.



She's gone.



Life is for the alive, my dear.



We could have a life, us two.



Maybe not like I dreamed.



Maybe not like you remember.



But we could get by.



ANTHONY:
Mr. Todd? Mrs. Lovett, ma'am?



What is it, Anthony?



He has her locked in a madhouse.



- Johanna?
- Fogg's Asylum.



I've circled the place a dozen times.
There's no way in. It's a fortress.



I've got him.



ANTHONY: Mr. Todd?



We've got her.



Where do you suppose all the wigmakers
in London go to obtain their hair?



Bedlam.



They get it from the lunatics
at Bedlam.



I don't understand.



We shall set you up
as a wigmaker's apprentice.



That'll gain you access.
And then you take her.



Go, quickly, go!



Fetch the boy.



Don't you think you should
leave the boy alone?



Toby? Mr. Todd needs you.



Yes, ma'am.



Mr. T?



Do you know where the Old Bailey is?



Yes, sir. Not that I ever been there.



Take this there.
Seek out a Judge Turpin. Repeat that.



Go to Old Bailey. Find Judge Turpin.



You put that into his hands.
Only to him, you understand?



Yes, sir. While I'm out, do you mind
if I stop by the grocer...?



No. You're not to stop.
You're not to speak.



You're to deliver the letter.
Do you understand?



Yes, sir.



Where you been, lad?



We had quite the rush at dinnertime.
Me poor bones is ready to drop.



Mr. Todd sent me on an errand.



And on the way back, I went by
the workhouse, just to take a look.



And I was thinking,
but for you, I'd be there now.



- Hm.
- Or someplace worse.



Seems like the good Lord
sent you for me.



Oh, love, I feel quite the same way.



Listen to me, please. Do you know
there's nothing I wouldn't do for you?



Say, if there were someone around...



...someone bad.



Only, you didn't know it.



What is this?
What are you talking about?



Nothing's gonna harm you



Not while I'm around



Nothing's gonna harm you
No, sir, not while I'm around



What do you mean,
"someone bad"?



Demons are prowling everywhere
Nowadays



I'll send 'em howling, I don't care
I got ways



Hush, darling.
There's no need for this.



No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare



Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle, I'll be there



Demons'll charm you with a smile



For a while, but in time



Nothing can harm you



Not while I'm around



That's nice, dear.



Now, what is all this foolishness?
What are you talking about?



Little things that I've been thinking,
about Mr. Todd.



Not to worry, not to worry
I may not be smart, but I ain't dumb



I can do it, put me to it
Show me something I can overcome



Not to worry, ma'am



Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true



I don't need to, I won't never
Hide a thing from you



Like some



Now, Toby, dear, haven't we had
enough of this foolish chatter?



Yeah.



How about I give you
a nice, shiny new penny...



...and you go and get us
some toffees?



That's Signor Pirelli's purse!



No, it's not. Just something Mr. T
give me for my birthday.



That proves it! We gotta go, ma'am.



We gotta find the beadle
and get the law here!



Shh! Hush, now,
you're not going anywhere.



You just sit here, nice and quiet,
next to me. That's right. Right.



How could you think
such a thing of Mr. Todd?



He's been so good to us.



Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around



Nothing's gonna harm you, darling
Not while I'm around



Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while



But in time



Nothing's gonna harm you



Not while I'm around



Funny we should be having
this little chat right now.



Because I was just thinking...



You know how you fancy
coming into the bakehouse with me...



...to help make the pies?



Yes, ma'am.



Well, no time like the present, eh?



I feel bad for you,
going up and down all these stairs.



Well, that'll be your job now.



Yes, ma'am.



Quite a stink, ain't there?



You see those grates? They go down
to the sewers, and the smells come up.



Always a few rats
gone home to Jesus down there.



Now, this'll be the bake oven.
Three dozen at a time.



Always be sure the door
is closed properly, like this.



Door's closed properly.



This is a grinder.



Pop in the meat.



Give it a good grind.



Pops out there.



You try.



Good grind.



Comes out there.



That's my boy.



I'm just gonna pop upstairs,
back in two shakes, all right?



Do you mind if I have a pie
while I wait?



As many as you like, son.



FOGG: Oh, yes, sir, I agree.
It would be to our mutual interest...



...to come to some arrangement
in regard to my poor children's hair.



Brunettes.



Redheads.



I keep the blonds in here.



It was yellow hair
you was looking for, sir?



Yes.



That one there has the shade I need.



Come, child.



Smile for the gentleman
and you shall have a sweetie.



Now, where shall I cut?



Not another word, Mr. Fogg,
or it will be your last.



Now I leave you to the mercy
of your children.



I got him locked in, but if he escapes,
he'll go to the law.



- Then he won't escape.
- I don't know, Mr. Todd.



The judge'll be here soon...



Excuse me, sir. Gave me a fright.



Not my intention, good madam,
I assure you.



Though I am here on official business.



You see, there's been some complaints
about the stink from your chimney.



They say at night,
it is something most foul.



Health regulations
and the general public welfare...



...naturally being my duty...



...I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to take a look...



...at your bakehouse.



Of course, sir.



But first, why don't you come upstairs?
Let me pamper you.



Much as I do appreciate
tonsorial doormen...



...I really ought to see
to my official obligations first.



I completely understand.



If you'll indulge me, sir,
what is that exotic aroma?



Ah. Heh.



Me secret is a touch of ambergris.



Dare I offer you something
a tad more appropriate...



...for a gentleman of your standing?



The ladies will
greatly appreciate it, sir.



Well, you are the expert
in these matters.



Only take a moment.



Would you like a bit of bay rum, sir?



Ooh. Bay rum is very bracing.



Let me out!



Please, let me out!



Let me out!



LOVETT: Toby?



Where is he?



Toby, where are you, love?



Toby?



LOVETT:
Nothing's gonna harm you



Not while I'm around



Toby?



LOVETT: Where are you hiding?



SWEENEY: Toby?



Nothing's gonna harm you, darling



Not while I'm around



Toby!



Mr. Todd!



You wait for him here. I'll return
with a coach in less than half an hour.



Don't worry. No one'll recognize you.



You're safe now.



Safe?



So we run away
and then all our dreams come true?



I hope so.



I've never had dreams.
Only nightmares.



Johanna...



...when we're free of this place,
all the ghosts will go away.



No, Anthony. They never go away.



I'll be right back to you.
Half an hour and we'll be free.



BEGGAR WOMAN: Beadle, beadle



No good hiding, I saw you



Are you in there still, beadle?
Beadle?



Beadle, dear beadle?



Beadle deedle deedle deedle deedle
Dumpling, beadle dumpling



Be-deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle
Deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle



Deedle deedle deedle de...



Who are you?
What are you doing in here?



Evil is here, sir.



The stink of evil, from below, from her!
She's the devil's wife.



Beware her, sir.
She with no pity in her heart.



Hey, don't I know you, mister?



TURPIN: Mr. Todd?



Where is she?



Below, Your Honor. With my neighbor.



Thank heavens the sailor
did not molest her.



Thank heavens, too, she has seen
the error of her ways.



She has?



Oh, yes.



Your lesson was well-learned.



She speaks only of you.
Longing for forgiveness.



Then she shall have it.



She'll be here soon, you say?



Yes.



Excellent, my friend.



How about a shave?



Sit, sir. Sit.



Oh



- Pretty women
- Pretty women, yes



Johanna, Johanna



Pretty women
Pretty women are a wonder



Pretty women



- What we do for pretty women
- Pretty women



- Blowing out their candles
- Blowing out their candles



- Or combing out their hair
- Combing out their hair



Then they leave



- Even when they leave
- Even when they leave you and vanish



- They still are there
- They somehow can still remain



- There with you, there
- They're there



How seldom it is
one meets a fellow spirit.



With fellow tastes...



...in women, at least.



What's that?



The years, no doubt,
have changed me, sir.



But then, I suppose
the face of a barber...



...the face of a prisoner in the dock,
is not particularly memorable.



Benjamin Barker.



Benjamin Barker!



Rest now, my friend



Rest now forever



Sleep now the untroubled sleep



Of the angels



- Come for a shave, have you, lad?
- No, I...



Everyone needs a good shave.



Forget my face.



Die! God in heaven, die!



You.



Why did you scream?



He was catching onto me dress,
but he's finished now.



SWEENEY:
I'll take care of it. Open the door.



Open the door, I said.



"Don't I know you," she said.



You knew she lived.



I was only thinking of you.



You lied to me.



No, no, not lied at all



No, I never lied



Lucy



Said she took the poison, she did
Never said that she died



- I've come home again
- Poor thing, she lived



But it left her weak in the head



All she did for months
Was just lie there in bed



Should've been in hospital
Wound up in Bedlam instead



LOVETT: Poor thing
- Oh, my God



Better you should think she was dead
Yes, I lied 'cause I love you



- I'd be twice the wife she was
- Lucy



- I love you
- What have I done?



Could that thing have cared for you
Like me?



Mrs. Lovett, you're a bloody wonder
Eminently practical



And yet appropriate as always



As you've said repeatedly
There's little point in dwelling on the past



- Now, come here, my love
- Do you mean it?



Everything I did, I swear
I thought was only for the best



Not a thing to fear, my love
What's dead is dead



Can we still be married?



SWEENEY:
The history of the world, my pet



Oh, Mr. Todd, oh, Mr. Todd
Leave it to me



Is learn forgiveness and try to forget



By the sea, Mr. Todd
We'll be comfy-cozy



By the sea, Mr. Todd
Where there's no one nosy



And life is for the alive, my dear
So let's keep living it



- Just keep living it, really living it
- Just keep living it, really living it



There was a barber and his wife



And she was beautiful



A foolish barber and his wife



She was his reason and his life



And she was beautiful



And she was virtuous



And he was...
