1
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,040
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your Captain speaking.

2
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,880
We will shortly be approaching
Timmins airport. Local time is 6:30.

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,680
It's a beautiful spring morning, and the
temperature is approximately seven degrees

4
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,600
with occasional light snow flurries.

5
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,920
I hope you've had a pleasant flight and
enjoy your stay here in Northern Ontario.

6
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,600
Do you want more coffee?

7
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,600
Yes. Thank you.

8
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,120
Do you mind if I sit here?

9
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,240
No.

10
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,240
Can I take your order?

11
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,400
Yes, please. I'll
have a Coke, please.

12
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,760
Diet?

13
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, I've tried. It's just the"no
eating" part that I struggle with.

14
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm kidding. I'll have
a Diet Coke, yes. Thanks.

15
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,000
What are you reading?

16
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,280
Wipe The Slate, Light The Candle.

17
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,240
Is that a novel?

18
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,760
It's fiction.

19
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,800
Hmm.

20
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,160
I've been thinking of writing one
of those. You can make tons of money.

21
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,880
All the gullible people out
there, searching for answers.

22
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,440
I have the best title."The
Bleeding Child Within."

23
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,280
What do you think?

24
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,880
It's very good.

25
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,720
I don't know what particular area of human
pain or misery I'm going to focus it on yet.

26
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,520
I just like the title. Thanks.
I don't want to waste it.

27
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,920
You're English, right?

28
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
Look, you seem like a
really chatty kind of person,

29
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,520
and I don't want to be
rude, but I'm not chatty.

30
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,600
So, perhaps you'd be better
off sitting somewhere else.

31
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,640
Have you seen some of these people?

32
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,760
Oh, there's a few
empty tables around.

33
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,680
Do you want to know why I sat here? Because
you look like a man who needs to talk.

34
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,240
You look like a guy who hasn't
talked in a really long time.

35
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,400
-That's why you sat here?
-That is why I sat here.

36
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,040
And because I need a lift.

37
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,560
And you were the cleanest option.

38
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,720
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,160
Good luck.

40
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,360
Change of heart?

41
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,880
No, I just tried to change
gear. It's automatic.

42
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,240
Oh, okay.

43
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,320
Well, good luck.

44
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,480
I'm driving to Winnipeg. You
better get out when I've had enough.

45
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,880
Yes. Absolutely. No problem.

46
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Bit of a drive, Winnipeg.

47
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,760
-I'm Vivienne, by the way.
-Alex.

48
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,080
I have to tell you, I
just got out of prison.

49
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Oh.

50
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,720
Fraud?

51
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,120
I killed someone.

52
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,040
Okay.

53
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,040
-So, about this person you killed...
-I don't want to talk about it.

54
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,200
I only mentioned it because I wanted you
to be aware that ordinary-looking people

55
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
are often the ones you need to avoid.

56
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,880
Okay. Gotcha. Look out
for the ordinary ones.

57
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,840
-So you're feeling uneasy now?
-Nope.

58
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,320
-Sure?
-Well, maybe a little.

59
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,720
Uneasy. I tend not to visit"scared".

60
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,280
My mum is scared of everything, and I've
made a conscious decision not to go there.

61
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,720
If I hadn't been starving, I wouldn't have stopped
at that diner. That's what I call frightening.

62
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,600
You can't be afraid of tattoos and
bad teeth. It's part of their appeal.

63
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,080
-I don't really think they'd hurt anyone.
-I was talking about the food.

64
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,880
Oh.

65
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,200
You got kids?

66
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,360
No.

67
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,200
Really? At your age? No kids.

68
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,040
Low sperm count?

69
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,560
-More of a low partner count.
-Ah, I know the feeling.

70
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,080
Guys my age just don't like me.

71
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,400
Mind you, you're quite an
attractive-looking guy. What's your excuse?

72
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,080
I don't want to talk about it.

73
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,920
There's a surprise.

74
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,560
So we're here, sharing a meal.

75
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,520
You know, if I was a few years
older, this would be a date.

76
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,800
-A few? You're very generous!
-Mmm-hmm, I know how the world works.

77
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,040
I give a little something,
you give a little something.

78
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,000
All right, all right. Both my parents
are dead, and I have one brother.

79
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,640
That wasn't so hard!

80
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,920
He hates me.

81
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,640
Whoa there! Nothing, and
then the floodgates open.

82
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,400
Go, Alex. Go, Alex.

83
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,600
We're completely different.

84
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,560
He's handsome and very fit,
works at the stock exchange.

85
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,680
He's what you might call a hot shot.

86
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,080
A"hot shot"?

87
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, you know what they say."Behind every
successful man is a truly astonished woman."

88
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,120
-Is that what they say?
-Yeah, that's what they say.

89
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,440
He's gay.

90
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,960
That's my point exactly!

91
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,440
Oh, I did good!

92
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,640
And look at these.

93
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,600
-Flashing balls that play music.
-Just what she's always wanted.

94
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,920
You do not know my
mother, Mr Sarcastic.

95
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,440
She's gonna be beside
herself when she sees these.

96
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,160
I can't wait to see her face!

97
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Oh, I love this song.

98
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,080
("ALL RIGHTNOW" BY FREE PLAYING)

99
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
# Let's move before they
raise the parking rate

100
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,240
"# Ow! All right now

101
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,360
# Baby, it's all right now

102
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,040
# All right now Baby,
it's all right now #

103
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,920
Vivienne.

104
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,640
Are you okay?

105
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,480
Vivienne!

106
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,720
Oh, fuck, fuck.

107
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,120
Are you okay? Are
you okay? Just stay...

108
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,240
-Someone's in the car.
-Stay. Stay. Don't get up.

109
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,560
-There's somebody still in the car.
-Don't move.

110
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,560
Get her out of the car.

111
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,920
Calm down, sir. Calm down.

112
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Sir, relax.

113
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,760
I'm sorry.

114
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,920
Let's go.

115
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,480
She's inside the car. You
have to get her out of there.

116
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,680
Mr Hughes?

117
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,800
I'm going to have to ask you to hang
around for a while, couple of days tops.

118
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,120
Just till we get all
the statements in.

119
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,240
Procedure, you understand?

120
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,640
Clyde, that urgent stuff has
just arrived, do you want me to...

121
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh, okay, Meryl.

122
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,440
I'm sorry, Mr Hughes, I'm
just going to have to...

123
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,640
My officer managed to
retrieve some of your things.

124
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,160
We can get the rest to you
once they've been released.

125
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,640
Anyway, I'd appreciate if you'd just check
there's nothing of Miss Freeman's in there.

126
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,560
-And I'll see you out front.
-I'd like to speak to her mother.

127
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm sorry?

128
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,480
Vivienne's mother.

129
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,840
-It's always a difficult time for the family.
-I realise that.

130
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,760
Well, with respect, sir,
I don't think you do.

131
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,520
If your daughter was killed in an accident,
would you want to speak to the driver?

132
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
I didn't kill Vivienne. The driver
of the truck killed Vivienne.

133
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,640
Yes, but it wouldn't be very professional of me
to go giving out personal information. Would it?

134
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,520
Goodbye, Florence.

135
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,520
Yes?

136
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,480
-I'd like to talk to Mrs Freeman.
-Why?

137
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,360
Mrs Freeman, may I come in?

138
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,480
-Do I know you?
-No.

139
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
My name is Alex Hughes.

140
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,960
I just wanted to talk to
you for a couple of minutes.

141
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,160
About what? I'm very busy
and I don't do social.

142
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,480
The police have been, haven't they?

143
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,320
Yes. The police were here two
hours and twenty minutes ago.

144
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,440
-So you know what's happened?
-Yes. I know Vivienne is dead.

145
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,600
Is that it?

146
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,680
I just wanted to explain.

147
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,440
I gave your daughter a lift.

148
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,280
It was an accident.

149
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,560
I'm so sorry.

150
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,480
Okay.

151
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,400
It's just that Vivienne bought you
something. She said you'd like them.

152
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,280
-Sparklies? She got me sparklies?
-Yeah.

153
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,320
Are you okay?

154
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,040
Take off your outdoor shoes
and put them in the row.

155
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,120
Don't move any of the others.

156
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,120
Oh, I'm supposed to offer you something. Would
you like an herbal tea? I have 17 varieties.

157
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,320
-Yes, let me... -No, don't come
in my kitchen. That's off-limits.

158
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,560
I'm gonna give you the liquorice one.
I can't stomach the liquorice one.

159
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,560
It tastes like cat pee.

160
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,320
Are you alone here?

161
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,560
Yes.

162
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,640
If anybody...

163
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,960
I could stay with you for a couple of days.
-I have two parents.

164
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,960
They're hiking in Algonquin.
No one can get a signal.

165
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,000
Maybe the police could put you
in touch with someone to talk to.

166
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,280
-Someone qualified.
-About what?

167
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,200
-About what's happened.
-Okay.

168
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,880
I just came to explain...

169
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,880
I don't handle this sort
of thing well at all.

170
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,720
-Oh, give me your clothes.
-I'm sorry?

171
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,120
Take off your clothes.
Give them to me.

172
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,280
I'll give them back. I don't want
the wet contaminating my carpet.

173
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,720
Take off your clothes.
I'm getting you dry ones.

174
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,480
By the way, that's my third-favourite
sweater, so you can't keep it.

175
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,240
Don't look at me.
I'm doing my checking.

176
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,600
I check the kitchen every time I use
it. And every time I don't use it.

177
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,680
-That must take up a lot of time.
-Yes, it does.

178
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,480
That's Marilyn, Vivienne's dog.

179
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,320
I can't stand her.

180
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,200
So did Vivienne live here
with you all the time?

181
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,720
Yes. Vivienne came on a short stay
three years ago and didn't leave.

182
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,520
She lived with my parents until then.

183
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,000
That's who she was visiting.

184
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,440
Why was she hitchhiking?

185
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,880
Vivienne wanted to be a writer.

186
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,880
She said she would
always try and get a ride

187
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,680
with the most
lonely-looking characters

188
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,800
because they had the best stories.

189
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,120
Mrs Freeman.

190
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,440
This is all a bit difficult for me.

191
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,600
I came here to apologise because
your daughter died and it was my car.

192
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,280
Did you do it on purpose?

193
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,120
-Of course not. We'd just stopped at the...
-Sit down, then.

194
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,640
And I'm not a missus, I'm Linda.

195
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,040
I haven't got a problem with you.

196
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,760
You must be all right because you gave
Vivienne a lift and you brought me my sparklies.

197
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,880
Is there a problem with the tea?

198
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
No, no, it's not the tea.

199
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,880
Are you sad because someone
you didn't know died?

200
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,520
This is guilt, Linda.
I feel guilty, okay?

201
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,840
Right, because you were driving.

202
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,120
-Yes, because I was driving.
-But he ran into you.

203
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,400
Yes, he ran into me.

204
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,280
Right.

205
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,920
Linda!

206
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,000
What is she doing here again?

207
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,040
She's already been here once
today. I'm not letting her in again.

208
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,480
Linda!

209
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,240
Go away, Florence. Nobody
wants you here! Get lost!

210
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,400
-Linda, I just want to...
-Whatever it is, I don't need it. Go away!

211
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,720
Alex, tell her to go away. Tell her.

212
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,720
Oh.

213
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,280
-Hello.
-Hello.

214
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,440
I really think Linda needs
someone to stay with her tonight.

215
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,120
-No, I don't. You're stupid!
-It's all right, Linda. I'm only here to help!

216
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,320
Whatever it is, I don't
need it. Leave me alone.

217
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,440
I really don't think she wants
to talk about it any more tonight.

218
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,760
And you are?

219
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,600
Alex Hughes.

220
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,400
Goodbye, Florence.

221
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Are you staying?

222
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,080
-No, no, I...
-Yes, he's staying!

223
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,400
Alex Hughes is staying, and if you
come back I'm calling the police.

224
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,040
Okay, you have my number!

225
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,880
Linda, I can't stay.

226
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,680
Well, you'll have to
give me my sweater back.

227
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,760
-I should call a taxi.
-They won't pick up from this house.

228
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,360
-Not after last time.
-What about a bus?

229
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,080
It's too late.

230
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,080
-Is there a hotel?
-Yes.

231
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,880
-Where is it?
-It's four miles up the highway.

232
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,560
-I should get my clothes.
-They haven't finished their cycle.

233
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,320
-Do you want tea?
-No.

234
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,720
Would you like to go out and
play? I have a trampoline.

235
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,680
-I'll just get my things.
-I think you should stay until Tuesday.

236
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,960
-I'm sorry.
-They collect the garbage on Tuesday.

237
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,800
I don't do garbage.

238
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,000
-Linda, I appreciate the offer, but...
-It was Vivienne's job.

239
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,400
I can't touch garbage. So you'll
have to take the bags out now.

240
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,120
-Do you want food?
-Linda, I'm sorry but I can't do this.

241
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,800
I'll just get my clothes
and then I have to leave.

242
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,120
You can't... Don't go in my kitchen!

243
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
I'll get your stupid clothes!

244
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,520
-Now what are you doing?
-Fuck.

245
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,840
I'm sorry. I didn't
know this was your room.

246
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,560
Where are you going? Stay still.

247
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,480
I saw the bunk beds and I thought...

248
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,760
Vivienne says I'm probably the only adult
in the entire world who has a bunk bed.

249
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,520
I've tried other beds and I don't like them.
I've slept in this bed since I was three.

250
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,800
-I'll find somewhere else to sleep.
-No, no. Get back under here.

251
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,280
I need to know where you are. I don't
want you pounding around my house.

252
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,680
Do you snore?

253
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,720
I don't know.

254
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,480
Well, lie down and go
to sleep. I need my rest.

255
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,160
And if you try and touch me,
I'll shoot you. I have a gun.

256
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,000
Can you see the stars?

257
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,480
# The stars at night are shining
bright Deep in the heart of Wawa #

258
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,200
Linda, I hope you don't
mind. I ate a cracker.

259
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,400
-You what? You went in my kitchen?
-Yes.

260
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,840
-I'm sorry, I was a bit hungry.
-I don't care.

261
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,520
I cleaned up afterwards.

262
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,000
"Hi, this is the madhouse."

263
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,160
Leave us a message and we'll
probably get back to you.

264
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,720
Please speak slowly and be precise.

265
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,800
Linda. The phone.

266
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,800
Linda?

267
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,880
You all right?

268
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm fine.

269
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,400
If you get your mouth completely full of
snow, it all dissolves and you can drink it.

270
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,880
It's your... Aren't you cold?

271
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,840
I have an unusual body
temperature control.

272
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,400
It feels just right.

273
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,240
Have you ever had an orgasm, Alex?

274
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,480
It has been known.

275
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Vivienne once described
an orgasm to me.

276
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,520
It sounds like an inferior version of what
I feel when I have a mouth full of snow.

277
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,520
You should try it.

278
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,040
Hi.

279
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,560
I heard about Vivienne. I'm
so sorry. I really liked her.

280
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,040
She all right?

281
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,120
I don't know.

282
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,560
-What exactly is it?
-Autism.

283
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,840
But she's very verbal.

284
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,320
I had noticed.

285
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,680
Are you all right?

286
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,680
-I don't know.
-I'm Maggie.

287
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,800
And everybody's been saying
that it wasn't your fault.

288
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,440
-Alex.
-I know. It's a very small town.

289
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,000
So has anyone been feeding that dog?

290
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,240
In a manner of speaking.

291
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,360
Well, if she needs
anything, I'm right here.

292
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,400
Not that she'll talk to me. Bye.

293
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,920
Alex. Alex, we have
to make a snowman.

294
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,000
Do we?

295
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,240
Vivienne came to visit me every year, and
we always made a crazy creature snowman.

296
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,080
We kept on doing it. We
haven't made one this year.

297
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,560
Linda, there's a message on
the machine from your parents.

298
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,760
Let's make a chipmunk!

299
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,280
We never made a chipmunk.
I love chipmunks.

300
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:34,080
From now on, every time I miss Vivienne,
I'm going to make a crazy creature snowman.

301
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,200
"Hi folks, it's only Mom and Dad."

302
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,800
We're just ringing to
let you know we're fine.

303
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,960
"Hello!"

304
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,760
"Your dad got an icicle embedded"
in his privates yesterday.

305
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,280
"Don't ask."

306
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,480
"But apart from that we're A-okay."

307
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,960
Now, we hope everything's fine with
you and that Vivvy got back all right.

308
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,480
We'll ring you again when we
can get to the next pit stop.

309
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,240
We're miles away from anywhere!

310
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,920
"Ellen, come on,
they get the message."

311
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,760
Okay, now, keep warm.
Love you both." "Bye!"

312
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,640
You should really try to get a hold
of them. They'd want to be here.

313
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,960
I have to go identify
Vivienne's body today.

314
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,640
And tomorrow is work. And
Tuesday they collect the garbage.

315
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,400
-Work? -I work part-time
at the Valu-mart.

316
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,120
I stack shelves.
Will you come with me?

317
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,320
To work? I don't think they'll
be expecting you at work.

318
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,880
No, to see Vivienne's
body. Will you come with me?

319
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,760
I have to work or I won't get paid.

320
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,320
Well...

321
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,120
If you want me to, yeah.

322
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,960
I have to go in to the police
station anyway to pick up my stuff,

323
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,720
and then I should be on my way.

324
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,280
I don't know why I have to
go. Everyone knows it's her.

325
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,800
-It's just procedure.
-I've seen it on TV.

326
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,280
They always let two people
come in the room with them.

327
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,800
So will you come in the room with me?

328
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,360
Yes. If you want me to.

329
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,840
-Do people like you, Alex?
-Not much, no.

330
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm not surprised.

331
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,320
It's because those glasses
don't look right on your face.

332
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,280
You have a long face, and those
glasses make you look shifty.

333
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,040
-Really?
-Yes.

334
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,960
-You need some new frames.
-I think it'll take more than that.

335
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,040
I know how you neuro-typical people
are obsessed with having friends.

336
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,840
I'm only trying to help you get some.

337
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,680
Well, I appreciate your efforts, but in
my experience friends can be overrated.

338
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,960
There. Now you look almost nice.

339
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,080
Mrs Freeman, is this your daughter?

340
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,600
-Miss Freeman.
-I'm sorry. Miss Freeman.

341
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,360
Miss Freeman, is this your daughter?

342
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,880
Linda, is this Vivienne?

343
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,160
She looks different.

344
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,600
I'm sorry, Linda, I need
a verbal identification.

345
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Is this Vivienne Freeman?

346
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,240
Yes. Yes, it is.

347
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,480
Come on, let's get you home.

348
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,240
-Don't talk to me now until I say so.
-Okay.

349
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,080
Linda. Linda, oh, I was so
sorry to hear about Marianne.

350
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,920
-Vivienne.
-Vivienne.

351
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,840
Vivienne. Oh, she was
such a personality.

352
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,480
Diane. Diane Wootten.

353
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,760
Why I keep that name I'll never
know. Been divorced two years.

354
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,720
Alex. Alex Hughes.

355
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,240
Oh, now I know you're not a native.

356
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,240
-Not with that delectable accent.
-No.

357
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,760
Linda, if there's anything I
can do for you. Anything at all.

358
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,880
-Like what?
-Well, like anything.

359
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,360
It must be so awful
losing a child like that.

360
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,720
-I didn't lose her. She's dead.
-Linda.

361
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,680
-What?
-It's perfectly all right.

362
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,760
I know all about autism.
I've seen that film.

363
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,080
Okay, well, you take care of yourself,
Linda. I'll be keeping my eye on you.

364
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,240
Nice meeting you, Alex. Sure
it won't be the last time.

365
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,240
Have you made up your mind
about the funeral, Linda?

366
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,480
You have to decide what to do. The
service, the flowers, the people.

367
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,440
-It's not a wedding!
-No, but it takes a lot of sorting out.

368
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,160
It's important to get it right.

369
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,080
If we have the funeral on Monday,
would you stay until Tuesday?

370
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,160
-To put the bins out.
-The garbage cans, yes. I don't do garbage.

371
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,720
Okay, here's what I'll do. I'll
stay and help organise the funeral.

372
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,480
-And then you'll...
-Yes, then I'll put the garbage out.

373
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,240
-On Tuesday.
-Yes.

374
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,400
-Perfectamundo.
-But then I have to go.

375
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,720
You better tell me about what
you think Vivienne would want.

376
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,320
I know what Vivienne would
want. She'd want to be alive.

377
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,960
-What was she pestering you about?
-Who?

378
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,080
This morning. That
Maggie, from next door.

379
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,040
I think she just wanted
to pay her respects.

380
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,440
She's a prostitute, Alex. I don't
think she has much respect to give.

381
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,360
"...remember when I noticed my eyebrows,
but I know that's when it all started."

382
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,960
"What is the moment worth?"

383
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,600
"The past is only a memory,
the future a fantasy.

384
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,400
"It's only in the present
that we truly live."

385
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,240
Okay, Vivienne.

386
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
See you later. Have a good one.

387
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,840
-Hello. Again.
-Hello.

388
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,520
I just came around to... It's a bit of a
clich, really. To borrow some tea. Normal tea.

389
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,000
-And that would be to drink with the fruitcake?
-She's not mad.

390
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,560
No, I know. Vivienne
explained it all to me.

391
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,440
"High functioning, can talk a glass eye
to sleep but can't tie her shoelaces."

392
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,200
-Don't you like her?
-She doesn't like me, for some reason.

393
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,600
-So did you really come around for tea?
-Have you got any?

394
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Assam. Darjeeling.

395
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,000
There is a God.

396
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
No. There is FedEx.

397
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,800
An English friend
of mine sent it over.

398
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,440
Don't go inventing a deity to
thank for the small miracles.

399
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,360
-They just happen. -So
you're a non-believer.

400
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,720
I am. Which makes me a bit
of a novelty around here.

401
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,960
Then again, so's Linda. It's
a judgemental town, this.

402
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,040
The emphasis being on the mental.

403
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,160
-I assume you're new to the area.
-Oh, no. No. I've lived here for 1 2 years.

404
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,320
So how are you holding up?

405
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,440
I keep seeing her face.

406
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,240
She was singing.

407
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,000
She had all this energy, and I
walked away without a scratch.

408
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,280
-So are you planning on staying here for a while?
-Apparently. Until after the funeral.

409
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,360
That's very sweet of you.

410
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,040
Listen, I...

411
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,640
I don't know what kind of plans you have
with my neighbour, but I'm free tonight.

412
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,320
And, I don't know, I could cook
something. We could have dinner, maybe.

413
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,120
Thank you.

414
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,200
# There's things I want

415
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,160
# There's things I think I want

416
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,880
# There's things I've had

417
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,680
# There's things I wanna have #

418
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,960
What are you listening to?

419
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,240
Just trying to find something for
Vivienne. Stereophonics. They're not bad.

420
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,360
I prefer tinnitus.

421
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,680
Linda, can I ask, if you don't like
people, how did you manage with Vivienne?

422
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,560
I don't like normal people,
I like useful people.

423
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,920
And people who like doing
the things I like doing.

424
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,760
Vivienne was very helpful
to me. We had a lot of fun.

425
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,000
I know how you must be
feeling. I had a son...

426
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,760
You don't know how I'm
feeling, because you're not me.

427
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,280
...who died.

428
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:17,760
Nobody knows how I'm feeling because
half the time I don't have a clue.

429
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,680
Well, I know how that feels,
too. When I found out about...

430
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,960
Do you want to go out and
play on the trampoline?

431
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,240
No. No, thank you.

432
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
We could make a snowman.

433
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,680
Well, I was gonna
tell you about my son

434
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,400
but now I think I'll just sit
here, if it's okay with you.

435
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,440
Did your son like the snow?

436
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,040
No.

437
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,400
No. That was one of the
few things he didn't like.

438
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,880
Oh.

439
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,760
Did you know that no
two snowflakes are alike?

440
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,560
Wilson Bentley photographed
2,354 snowflakes.

441
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,560
His best snowstorm was on his birthday
on February 1 4th, 1 928, when he was 6 3.

442
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,480
He called it"a gift
from kind winter".

443
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,920
Is it okay if I take
the dog out in a bit?

444
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,000
Don't let her pee on my snow.

445
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,480
-Hi.
-Hi.

446
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,800
Right on time.

447
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,520
I didn't know... I'm sure this isn't
the norm but I brought you some tea bags.

448
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,000
Ginseng and fennel.

449
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,760
I find"the norm" usually involves
chocolate, or if I'm really lucky, perfume.

450
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,240
But ginseng and fennel, wow! Come in.

451
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,280
And the dog comes too.

452
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,120
So, Mr Snow Drifter,
what's your story?

453
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,480
-Me? Oh, there's nothing much to say, really.
-Oh, come on.

454
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,080
I can tell by looking at your face
that you have some interesting baggage.

455
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,600
I don't have baggage. I have haulage.

456
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,560
-See, I told you. You just look so...
-Shifty?

457
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,160
Mmm-mmm.

458
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,400
Sad.

459
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,440
I hope you like shrimp cocktail. It's
what I normally serve my gentleman callers.

460
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,000
I'm afraid it's not very original
but I really hate to cook.

461
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,360
After Linda's specialised
diet, believe me, I'd eat grit.

462
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,280
Everything's gluten-free.

463
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,200
She has leaky gut syndrome.

464
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,880
-As well as a ringing in her ears.
-Wow!

465
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,280
-So what about you?
-What, disease-wise?

466
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,400
No.

467
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,400
-You, generally.
-Oh, me.

468
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,680
I know, I like to keep an
air of mystery about me,

469
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,880
at least on the first date.

470
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,920
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

471
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,600
So how long are you
planning on staying?

472
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,360
You are very beautiful.

473
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm leaving after the funeral.

474
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,800
I like you.

475
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,720
I really like you.

476
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,400
And I hate having
sex on a full stomach,

477
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,040
so should we just skip the
main course and go next door?

478
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,600
Oh, shit, I forgot about
the English reserve thing.

479
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,160
Okay. I'm sorry. I've
embarrassed you. Let's just eat.

480
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,080
No. No, it's fine.

481
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,000
If I'm honest, it's
what I came round for.

482
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,680
Well, good, I'm glad
we cleared that up.

483
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,960
It's been a while.

484
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,360
Sorry if it was a bit quick.

485
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,080
I think the dog
might have put me off.

486
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,720
It's okay.

487
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,080
We have all night.

488
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,160
So why are you going to Winnipeg?

489
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,320
-You ask a lot of questions.
-Do I?

490
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,720
I'm going to meet an old friend.

491
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,640
A"friend" friend or a"friend" friend?

492
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,240
I should go.

493
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,280
I won't mention her again. I promise.

494
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,280
Why didn't you just fly straight
there like a normal person?

495
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,480
Well, I thought I'd try and take in some
of the lakes. It didn't look far on the map.

496
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,640
Would you even consider
driving from London to Moscow?

497
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,000
Actually, I was looking on a
globe. The scale was a bit off.

498
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,320
I think you're ready to try again.

499
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,440
Hey.

500
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,200
I should go.

501
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,400
I haven't done this kind
of thing before. I'm sorry.

502
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,360
How much do I owe you?

503
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,320
What?

504
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,240
For last night. What do I...

505
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,160
You want to pay me?

506
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,120
Well, I thought...

507
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,960
Oh, God, you're not, are you?

508
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,560
-It's just that Linda...
-Okay, yeah,

509
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,680
I have a few male callers now
and again, and yes, I like sex,

510
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,320
-but no, I am not a hooker.
-Oh, shit, I feel dreadful.

511
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,280
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

512
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,640
I have to say I'm more than relieved.

513
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,040
What, you're not a big
fan of ladies of the night?

514
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,760
I didn't think I'd have enough money
to see you as much as I want to.

515
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,760
Oh, my God.

516
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,760
Linda, I booked the cars
for 12:00, is that all right?

517
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,520
I'm going to work.

518
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,360
What do you think? Okay.

519
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,880
-What's the matter, Linda? What is it?
-No!

520
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,920
-It's on the rug. It's disgusting.
-No, it's okay, Linda. It's okay.

521
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,440
It's dog throw-up from
inside the dog's stomach.

522
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,680
-It's gonna make an unbelievably bad stain.
-Linda, it's okay.

523
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,920
It's not okay. It's not okay. I
can't do this. I can't do this!

524
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,560
-I need Vivienne. I need Vivienne.
-Well, I...

525
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,040
I'll sort it.

526
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,760
Please! Please don't
let it leave a stain.

527
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,000
-If it leaves a stain, I have to move!
-Linda!

528
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,080
I said I'll sort it.

529
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,520
Oh, please don't
let it leave a stain.

530
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,240
And don't go in my kitchen!

531
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,080
-Al?
-Oh, hello.

532
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,600
-Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you.

533
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,080
I'm so glad.

534
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,000
-What's she been eating?
-Don't know. Linda gives her bananas.

535
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,800
Bananas? She's not a monkey.

536
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,680
I don't know much about dogs.

537
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,080
You know about dog vomit, right?

538
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,040
Yeah.

539
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,360
Keep her off the bananas. I've heard
you can get this stuff in cans. Dog food.

540
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,880
-Controversial, I know.
-Yeah.

541
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,800
Actually, this isn't
a social call today.

542
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,560
Really?

543
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,240
I just came to warn
you about Alex Hughes.

544
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:05,000
Several little birds have told
me you and he are getting social.

545
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,440
I don't think that's any of your
business, Clyde, or anyone else's.

546
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,200
Honestly, this town is
getting so that you can't cough

547
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,640
without someone
alerting the authorities.

548
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,600
Yeah. I looked him up on our system.

549
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,360
He killed someone. Did you know?

550
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,120
No, he was driving the car,
but it wasn't his fault.

551
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:31,200
I'm not talking about Vivienne.
He killed a guy. He just got out.

552
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,840
-I didn't know that.
-Thought you should.

553
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,440
Now I do.

554
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,320
And, to top it all, he hit a cop.

555
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,800
Just ask yourself this,
Maggie. Is that normal?

556
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,120
Picking up young girls? Staying
with a mentally challenged lady?

557
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,480
Killing people? Hitting cops?

558
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,320
Well.

559
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,520
Oh, I've a spare ticket for a
magician up at the Legion on Wednesday,

560
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,440
if you're interested.

561
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,080
What's he gonna do,
Clyde? Make you disappear?

562
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,800
B-A-A-N-G.

563
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,400
You can't have two A's in"bang".

564
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,560
In comic book word Scrabble you can.
You can have three A's if you want.

565
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,200
With a double-letter
score, that makes 22 points.

566
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,360
-This game is ridiculous.
-No, it isn't.

567
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,760
It isn't, because you get to say words like
"Kerrang","Boing","Cowabunga","Buttocks".

568
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,800
What comic book did that come out of?

569
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,880
I don't know. I just like
saying"buttocks". Buttocks.

570
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,920
Okay, what's your word?

571
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,200
-I can make it up, right?
-Yes. That's the best bit.

572
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,920
Okay.
Y-A-A-

573
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,400
M-O-O-L.

574
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,800
That's four, five, six...

575
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,840
That's 24 points.

576
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,840
"Yaamool.""Yaamool", I like that.

577
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,040
Yaamool.

578
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,480
Okay, now you have to give an
example of it in a sentence.

579
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,320
Like I said, if you make up a
word, you have to give an example.

580
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,760
All right.

581
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,560
-Spiderman...
-Spiderman?

582
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,480
-What's wrong with Spiderman?
-Well, it's a bit obvious.

583
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,400
Oh, all right. Spiderman.

584
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:56,120
Spiderman is about
to save the universe

585
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,080
from an evil thing.

586
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,320
And...

587
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,600
So he hits him with
a jet of web. Yaamool!

588
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,560
And it stops him, it, in its tracks.

589
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,320
You are terrible at this game.

590
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,720
I got two more points than you.

591
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,280
D-A-Z-

592
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,280
L-I-O-U-S.

593
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,080
Dazlious.

594
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,560
-I'm assuming that's
a made-up word. -It is.

595
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,320
It's also 38 points for the word

596
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,000
and another 50 for
using up all my letters.

597
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,520
-That makes 88 points.
-And your example?

598
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,800
Mister Fantastic from
the Fantastic Four,

599
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,560
he's got arms made of elastic so they
can stretch for two, maybe 300 miles.

600
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:05,640
He's been imprisoned in a cave for seven
days with no food and no water and no light.

601
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,760
And on the eighth day,

602
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:12,040
he manages to loosen a rock and
push his way up through the top.

603
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,040
With his stretchy arms.

604
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:18,680
And up into the daylight, just as the
sun is coming up over the mountains,

605
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,760
and filling the sky with this white-yellow
light, and there's a stillness.

606
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:30,680
And in the few minutes he's got before
his captor, the evil Doctor Doom, returns,

607
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,720
he stops for one second.

608
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,600
And all he can hear
is his own breathing.

609
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:43,280
And he's totally overwhelmed by how big the
world is and how small and unimportant he is.

610
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,720
And as he turns around, we
see his face look to the sky,

611
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,960
and he says, very quietly,
so that no one can hear him...

612
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,440
He says,"Dazlious."

613
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,160
Time to make some tea.

614
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,880
I can see if I'm going to have
any chance of winning this game,

615
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,400
I'm going to really need to focus.

616
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,200
You know where to find me.

617
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,240
You know, I've had a bit
of a shady past. Oh, really?

618
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,680
-I was married for 1 5 years.
-Arrest this woman now.

619
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,880
He was a very nice man.

620
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:55,320
But I had affairs. I like the candies
and the flowers, the teabags bit.

621
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,040
I'm just not good at the
day-to-day stuff, you know.

622
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,320
I'm a selfish woman
and I broke his heart.

623
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,800
Made a real mess of it, actually.

624
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,400
So someone said you
can drink this water.

625
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,560
Yeah, it's supposed to have healing
properties. Why don't you take a sip?

626
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,760
-I don't think so.
-What, you don't want to be healed?

627
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,280
-Set free of your demons?
-They keep me company.

628
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,480
-I think we should be getting Marilyn back.
-You know, Alex,

629
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,960
I think maybe your dog's been getting
a little too much exercise lately.

630
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,080
Perhaps, you could
try walking it at home.

631
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,440
In the privacy of your own bathroom.

632
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,000
What exactly is it
that you want to know?

633
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,600
Everything.

634
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,720
That's Ryan. My son.

635
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,240
What? You said you
didn't have any kids.

636
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,320
I got a letter from Ryan.

637
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:17,200
His mum had finally allowed him to see his
birth certificate, and I was on it under"Father".

638
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,280
And are you his real dad?

639
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,840
Yes.

640
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,760
His mum's name's Rebecca. She's the
woman that I'm going to see in Winnipeg.

641
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:34,240
We had a short fling. I suppose she thought
that I was never that serious, so she...

642
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,560
It was 22 years ago.

643
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,680
What did he say to you?

644
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,760
He wrote me a list of all the things
he liked and all the things he hated.

645
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,840
I mean, when you saw him.

646
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,040
We arranged to meet in a restaurant.

647
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,920
I sat in the restaurant
until closing time,

648
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,760
and he never showed up.

649
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,800
He was in an accident
on the way to meet me.

650
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:15,320
-Got hit by a drunk driver and he died instantly.
-Oh, my God.

651
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,920
-That is terrible.
-I never even met him.

652
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,760
-So all I lost, really, was a fantasy.
-Oh, my God.

653
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,560
A fucking fantasy.

654
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,960
I spent the last four years
grieving over someone I never knew,

655
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,120
and now I'm doing it all
over again with Vivienne.

656
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,000
Come here. Come here.

657
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,720
"Good morning, I'm Mark Scott." And
I'm here every morning, all morning...

658
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:20,000
No, not those, dude.
Those are serial killer.

659
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,040
Getting warmer. You
know what, though?

660
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,440
Yeah, I think these
are the guys for you.

661
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,760
Oh, yeah. Am I good or what?

662
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,680
Actually, I think I'll just stick to my
old ones. I was just browsing, really.

663
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,240
Eye-browsing.

664
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,800
Right?

665
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,560
-Thanks for your time.
-It's cool.

666
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,040
-Love the accent, by the way.
-Thank you.

667
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:20,280
I... I came to talk to Linda.
She won't open the door.

668
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,280
Only to say sorry.

669
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,480
So did I and I'm still here.

670
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,920
Mind you, I wasn't the one ramming
a 40-ton truck into her daughter.

671
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,600
Look, man, I'm not a
killer, it was an accident.

672
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,760
-I've lost my job...
-My heart bleeds.

673
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,360
Well, haven't you ever
made a fucking mistake?

674
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,520
-I think you should go.
-I can't go. Not until I've...

675
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,280
Until you've what?

676
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,080
You lost your job? She lost her fucking
daughter, and not just any daughter,

677
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,240
one who would have helped her to
make some sense of all this shit!

678
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,680
You bought flowers,
you thick bastard.

679
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,920
-Come on, then.
-Just get out of here.

680
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,080
Come on, then! Let me have it.

681
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,000
Let me have it! Come on, come on!

682
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,760
Just don't push me.

683
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:38,280
What's the matter? You can't finish the job?
Come on! Don't you know you can't hurt me?

684
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,200
Don't you know I'm
fucking indestructible?

685
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,480
What are you doing?

686
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,720
What does it look like I'm
doing? I'm trampolining.

687
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,000
Linda...

688
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,280
Could you stop bouncing for a minute?

689
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,120
I want to tell you about
what happened with my son.

690
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,760
I went to prison.

691
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,080
-I went to prison because...
-I want you to bounce me up.

692
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,000
Not now, Linda.

693
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,440
Is it because you had a
fight with the truck driver?

694
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,640
Yes.

695
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:36,040
I won't see Vivienne again, you won't see
Vivienne again and he won't see Vivienne again.

696
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,920
We all have to get over it.

697
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,400
Okay. Now, bounce me up.

698
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,840
I'm not moving until you play with me.
I'm gonna stay out here all night long.

699
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,440
Please. Please, Alex. Please,
please, please bounce me.

700
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,560
Promise to let everyone come
back tomorrow after the funeral?

701
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,120
Yippee! Yes, yes, yes!

702
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,160
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce!

703
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,760
You worried about tomorrow?

704
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,200
I think it's done. I'm
worried about Linda.

705
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:59,120
It must be weird not wanting
to be with other people.

706
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:04,320
Not needing anyone to,
you know, plug into.

707
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,640
Don't you go worrying
about her on that account.

708
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,880
She's got quite enough going
on inside that head of hers.

709
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,400
But she needs other people to do things
for her if not necessarily with her.

710
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,960
Vivienne did all the boring
stuff. What's she going to do now?

711
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,480
You offering?

712
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,000
Wouldn't get past the door.

713
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,880
-I'm beginning to like this.
-What's that?

714
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,040
Being with you.

715
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,880
Being with Linda.

716
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,520
Being with myself. Again.

717
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:50,560
Hey, and I'm having sex, and these
muffins are great. That sort of thing.

718
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,640
You be careful, Mr Shifty.

719
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,360
Sorry to call so early, it's
just we had a collection.

720
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,480
We got a wreath for the church,

721
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,000
but I also wanted to bring a
little something else I had done.

722
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,720
Oh, that's very kind.

723
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,920
Is she in?

724
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,320
Oh, yes. Linda! Linda!

725
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,440
I like your robe.

726
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,520
Diane's brought you something.

727
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,360
-What is it?
-It's a bereavement cookie.

728
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,920
-I can't eat that.
-Oh?

729
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:11,200
-She's gluten free.
-Oh, right.

730
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,960
Well, waste not want
not. I'll take it back.

731
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,840
It's my nephew's fifth
birthday tomorrow.

732
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,920
So I'll scrape the icing
off. Put some new numbers on.

733
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,560
-A nice new number five.
-I'll scrape it.

734
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,440
There.

735
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,560
Well, I'll see you
both in church later.

736
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,360
-Thanks, Diane.
-Bye.

737
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,800
Despite both our faults, Linda, I actually
think we work quite well together, don't you?

738
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,920
Yes, I do. Can you please take the dog out
now? I don't want to talk to you any more.

739
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,600
Shall I come back in
about half an hour?

740
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:53,000
I don't know how I'll feel in half
an hour. I only know how I feel now.

741
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,120
Hello. You must be Alex. I'm Dirk.

742
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,600
And this is Ellen.

743
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,800
How do you do?

744
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,600
I'm sorry. I'd told
myself I wasn't gonna cry.

745
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:36,360
Every time we go away it's always Linda
we're worried about. Isn't it, Dirk?

746
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,400
We never even gave Vivienne a
second thought. We never thought...

747
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,960
Ellen's a bit upset. We've been
hiking. We came straight here.

748
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,160
-Yeah.
-Is Linda inside?

749
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,000
I'm half inside, half outside.

750
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,320
Hi, sweetie. Hi.

751
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,080
We've just been meeting Alex, Linda.

752
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,640
-Your eyes are red.
-Yes, they are.

753
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,160
-Mommy, cheek.
-Yeah, that's my girl.

754
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,040
-I'll let you have some time.
-Yes. Thank you, Alex.

755
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:14,480
I thought Vivienne would appreciate
something a bit unconventional.

756
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,880
Perfectamundo.

757
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,880
Is it compulsory to cry at funerals?

758
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,240
No. It's not compulsory.

759
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,200
Good, because I don't
know if I will or not.

760
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,000
Wilson Bentley, the man
who photographed snowflakes,

761
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,520
died after walking in a snowstorm.

762
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,840
Is there anything you need?

763
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,320
Yes.

764
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,640
I'd like you to put your arms
around me and squeeze me really hard,

765
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,200
but don't touch me with your hands.

766
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,160
Say when.

767
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:48,080
(PLAYING "JUSTLOOKING"
BY THE STEREOPHONICS)

768
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,880
Linda? Linda?

769
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,120
Please sit down.

770
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,760
For those who don't know,
I am Vivienne's grandad.

771
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,120
But as our daughter, Linda,
was unable to look after her,

772
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:36,400
my wife, Ellen, and I raised
Vivienne as our own for 1 6 years.

773
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,520
Vivienne was a real one-off,

774
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,920
and the most gentle and
generous person I have ever met.

775
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:54,760
She had an amazing ability, accepting people
for what they are, embracing their differences.

776
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:59,000
Most of you are probably aware that

777
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,520
Vivienne wanted to be a writer.

778
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,560
On her last visit to us,
only a week or so ago,

779
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:13,640
she gave me a children's picture
book that she was working on.

780
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,160
I'd like to read it to you

781
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:21,800
because it says more about Vivienne
than anything I could put into words.

782
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:31,120
"My Little Brother. My little
brother, James, is special.

783
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,840
"My little brother is
four and he can't talk yet.

784
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,120
"He doesn't always
understand what I say to him,

785
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,240
"and he's not a bit interested
in my wrestling toys.

786
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:48,480
"Dad plays chasing games with him and tries
to get him interested in rockets and football.

787
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,000
"But my little brother really
only likes the alphabet.

788
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:57,440
"He's very happy when we have alphabet
spaghetti for lunch, but then, so am I."

789
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:09,320
"Yesterday he took my
hands and danced with me.

790
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,200
"Every time he does
something new, however small,

791
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,120
"it's a brilliant feeling.

792
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,560
"I wish everyone could get to know
someone like my little brother.

793
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,800
"He makes you look at
things in a brand-new way.

794
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,720
"Some people say that James won't ever
do the things I do, but it doesn't matter.

795
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,720
"He'll just do different things.

796
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:43,640
"I love my little brother so much and one
day I know he'll tell me he loves me, too.

797
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:49,360
"Although he'll probably spell
it out in spaghetti first."

798
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,040
Thank you, Dirk.

799
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,280
Now please stand while we take a moment to
listen to one of Vivienne's favourite records,

800
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,120

("HELLO SUNSHINE" BY THE

803
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,600
Hello. Thank you so much.

804
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,960
Please take your shoes
off before entering.

805
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,200
Anything for you? No?

806
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,840
Excuse me.

807
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Why is that man still here?

808
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,040
Oh, Linda, hand these around.

809
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,880
All these people doing
social in my house.

810
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,360
-It's okay, Linda.
-It's not okay, it's horrible.

811
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:48,400
When are they gonna go? -Well, they'll
have a sandwich and then they'll go.

812
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,360
Just what do you see in him, Maggie?

813
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:06,680
You know, Clyde, you have
a superior air about you.

814
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,880
Who ever told you
you were so special?

815
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,200
Who ever told you you weren't?

816
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,320
It's surprisingly clean, eh?

817
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,360
That's the thing about
autism. They're neat freaks.

818
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,480
Yeah? You should take notes.
You could learn something.

819
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,920
-Why do you have to do that?
-What?

820
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,720
-Why do you have to be like that?
-It's a joke.

Try one of these.
They are gluten-free.

822
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:38,320
You know, Alex is very fond of you.
He talks about you all the time.

823
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,920
Maybe when he's gone,
I could come over and...

824
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,440
Why would I want you to come over?

825
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,720
They've had their sandwiches.
Why are they hanging around?

826
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,200
-Thank you so much for coming.
-No, really, it's just...

827
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:36,440
Funny place, this.
Never felt at home here.

828
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:44,800
But Linda always liked it. We bought it for
her because she wanted to be independent.

829
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,160
Especially after Vivienne was born.

830
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,920
How did that happen?

831
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,000
We still don't know.

832
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,360
She was very close... Well, relatively
close to a boy who went to the Centre.

833
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,920
We all assumed it was an experiment.

834
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,800
She didn't seem
remotely upset at first.

835
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,640
But she might have been
forced. We asked and we asked.

836
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:24,320
Anyhow, she was six months
gone before anyone noticed.

837
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,280
It's like everything with Linda.

838
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,760
You have to accept her totally.

839
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,440
And somehow Vivienne understood
that from very early on.

840
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,920
Oh, she would have loved the service.

841
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,480
And this, too. She loved a party.

842
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,920
You know, I don't think there's ever
been more than five people in this house.

843
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,480
I don't know how you persuaded her.

844
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,120
But anyway, I just
wanted to say thanks.

845
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,600
For staying. You didn't have to.

846
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:02,400
Actually, to be honest, the elements were
against me. I didn't really have an alternative.

847
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,000
There's always an alternative, Alex.

848
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:10,880
This house is getting
nasty, nasty, nasty!

849
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,440
("KITAKA SASSA" BY
TAKEMI KAKIZAKI PLAYING)

850
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,440
It's all right, honey.

851
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,520
You going?

852
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,560
Linda, I think you should stop now!

853
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,240
No, that's all right.

854
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,880
Leave her alone. She's okay.

855
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,000
-She's fine.
-But this is a wake, for heaven's sake.

856
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,400
She's fine. Just let her dance.

857
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,800
Please!

858
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:24,000
It's like getting back on
your bike. You'll be fine.

859
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,880
There's no point in worrying it'll happen again.
Nothing you can do. If it's coming, it's coming.

860
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,760
Thank you, Clyde,
that's very reassuring.

861
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:36,640
Can't say I'm sad to see you go.

862
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,640
-Don't tell me. Maggie?
-Yep.

863
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:49,080
-Do you think she'll ever...
-No.

864
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,920
Drive safely, then.

865
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,440
Hi!

866
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:08,280
I am never having that many
people in my house ever again.

867
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:12,880
-Where are your parents?
-I told them to go. I had to clean the house.

868
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,560
-They'll be back tomorrow.
-Oh, right.

869
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,960
I'd liked to have said goodbye.

870
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,640
I'm going to take Marilyn for a walk.

871
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:25,520
-Don't forget about the...
-Garbage. I know. 12:00.

872
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:32,080
-Hi.
-We've just come to say goodbye.

873
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,320
We?

874
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:39,480
Any chance you'll keep an eye on her?
She'd be dead in a week, otherwise.

875
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,400
Who? Linda or the dog?

876
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,800
She didn't take long to settle in.

877
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,280
Maybe I should do the same.

878
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:56,920
Saw this house in the real estate
window in town. It's by the lake.

879
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,680
Kind of tempting.

880
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:10,680
-Stupid idea.
-I told you I was selfish.

881
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,400
You did.

882
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:21,360
I hope you find what you're
looking for in Winnipeg.

883
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,760
Hmm, wonder what that
is. Good luck to me.

884
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,560
Maggie, I killed a man.

885
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,280
The driver who ran into my son.

886
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,360
I found out his name, where he lived.

887
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,240
I went there and I hit him.

888
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,600
Hard.

889
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,240
He fell.

890
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:02,040
He fell onto this stone floor.

891
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,560
He cracked his head open.

892
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,240
I know. Clyde told me.

893
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:19,400
-Why didn't you...
-I was waiting for you to mention it.

894
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,560
I'm glad you did.

895
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,680
You know, mostly he's
upset that you hit a cop.

896
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,160
Thanks.

897
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,840
I think you're gonna find
peace when you get there.

898
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,400
You'll probably end up staying.

899
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,520
But if you're ever passing
through here again, I...

900
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,360
I've had a really nice time.

901
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:51,000
Gotta do the garbage. Gotta do the garbage.
Garbage, garbage, gotta do the garbage.

902
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,680
Gotta do the garbage. Garbage...

903
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:55,440
They're already two hours late.
Maybe they're not coming today.

904
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,760
What if we do what everybody
else in the street does,

905
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,240
what everybody else in the
world does, and put the bags out?

906
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,840
Then if they don't turn up today,
you can leave them out until they do.

907
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:07,640
No! No, we're not going to do that. The bags
will split, and that's when raccoons come.

908
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,560
Raccoons have rabies and
they mess up the snow.

909
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,400
I'm sorry, Linda, I don't
know what else I can do.

910
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,480
I've got to get going. I've
already made arrangements.

911
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,080
-You are a very selfish man.
-No, I'm not, you're just unreasonable.

912
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:20,800
-I'm autistic!
-That's the same thing.

913
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:26,600
Apart from today you have been very
helpful, Alex, and I wanna say thank you.

914
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:31,080
You're not as interesting as Vivienne was
but you have some quite good characteristics.

915
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,160
Don't go overboard with
the praise there, Linda.

916
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,840
So, Linda...

917
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,720
I'm really going to have to go

918
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:55,880
very soon.

919
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,360
You have been very annoying.

920
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,920
But you've also been a
friend. I'm going to miss you.

921
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:24,560
I didn't think it'd be
so hard to say goodbye.

922
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,160
It's been a real pleasure.

923
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:35,560
You are the only
person I have ever met

924
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:41,880
who I didn't have to explain
or even justify myself to.

925
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,560
Perfectamundo.

926
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,800
-Sorry about the trash.
-Hmm.

927
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,880
-Can I send you a postcard?
-What for?

928
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,840
Okay, I'll give you a ring,
then. I've got your number.

929
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,000
When will you ring me?

930
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,640
Do you know, I think Vivienne
would have liked our story.

931
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:14,400
Well, she's not here
to see it, is she?

932
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,320
Right, then.

933
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,160
I'm so sorry about your daughter.

934
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,640
I'm off.

935
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,920
Erm, I left something for you.

936
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,600
It's in the freezer.

937
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:32,160
Snow cake.

938
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,680
Now that is interesting.

939
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,360
Oh, no.

940
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:58,040
And he's totally overwhelmed by how big the
world is and how small and unimportant he is.

941
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:02,720
And as he turns around, we
see his face look to the sky,

942
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:07,280
and he says, very quietly,
so that no one can hear him...

943
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,480
"Dazlious."
