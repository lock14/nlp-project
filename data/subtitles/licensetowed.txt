{711}{749}Hey.
{897}{936}Bye!
{1000}{1056}Bouquet?. Bouquet.
{1060}{1084}Beautiful, isn't it?.
{1117}{1157}But let me tell you the truth.
{1169}{1274}For a lot of people, marriage is like|sticking your tongue on a frozen flagpole.
{1278}{1345}It looks like fun when you see|friends doing it, so you say..
{1349}{1417}" Hey, I'll give it a try.|Just once."
{1421}{1499}Next thing you know, you're stuck.
{1503}{1538}Full of regret.
{1542}{1602}Praying, "Please get me|out of this with my dignity...
{1606}{1677}...if least not my extremities, intact."
{1681}{1734}But it doesn't have to be|like that, my friends.
{1738}{1813}It does not have to be like that.
{1817}{1855}That's where I come in.
{1859}{1918}Good marriages are my business.
{1927}{1975}Meeting the right person|in the first place?
{1979}{2045}Well, my friends, that is up to you.
{2049}{2085}Oh, I'm sorry.
{2089}{2164}-I'll go.|-Yeah, you go. Okay.
{2557}{2618}-Hi. I'm Sadie.|-Hi. Ben.
{2622}{2676}From that first, destined meeting...
{2689}{2761}...to the sweet innocence|of the first date.
{2880}{2936}-Are you skipping to second base?.|-What's that?. No.
{2940}{2981}You know why?. I'm not a skipper.
{2985}{3104}Maybe we should take care of first base,|just to make things right.
{3168}{3218}The first kiss.
{3234}{3293}The first time you say "I love you. "
{3297}{3339}-I love you.|-What?.
{3343}{3406}What?. A view.|What a view.
{3410}{3496}First time you say "I love you, "|and she actually hears you.
{3500}{3536}I love you.
{3574}{3649}-I ' m afraid you ' re not my type.|-I love you too.
{3812}{3873}You seriously didn't think I was|gonna let you see that?.
{3894}{3958}Let's skip to the next thing:|moving in together.
{3962}{4057}The first time she finds something|you don 't want her to see.
{4083}{4161}-Don't worry, I got the heavy ones.|-" Dear Mr. Brian Boitano. "
{4165}{4230}-Oh, God!|-" Congratulations on your triple Axel.
{4243}{4291}I wonder how much|you practice every week...
{4295}{4387}...and also how you make your hair|stay like that."
{4391}{4449}Hey, he was a legend. Okay?.
{4453}{4521}I mean, even at age 9 I knew that.
{4531}{4599}I'm gonna get a less embarrassing box.|Okay.
{4603}{4661}If she doesn 't dump your|wussy ass after that...
{4690}{4752}...then comes the big one: the proposal.
{5012}{5040}Sadie...
{5044}{5082}...you're a great girl. You are.
{5086}{5143}And I think it's time that|you and I were man and--
{5147}{5195}Lame. That is so lame.
{5294}{5375}We are so pleased all of you|could be here with us today...
{5379}{5481}...to celebrate our 30 years of marriage.
{5485}{5515}Cheers.
{5575}{5599}Cheers.
{5613}{5715}It is especially gratifying to be|surrounded by such good friends...
{5719}{5746}...and family...
{5755}{5854}...and of course,|our two beautiful daughters...
{5858}{5889}...Sadie...
{5893}{5932}...and Lindsey...
{5936}{5986}...who has moved back home with us...
{6025}{6075}...to try and make a new start for herself.
{6079}{6107}We are...
{6129}{6201}...so thrilled with her perseverance.
{6230}{6277}Thank you for the support, Dad.
{6337}{6430}And then there's Carlisle, Sadie's best|friend, who used to take baths with Sadie...
{6434}{6469}-What?.|-What?.
{6473}{6593}...when they were younger,|and pretend he was a submarine captain.
{6597}{6657}I destroyed all the photos.|I promise you.
{6661}{6733}-Thank you. Very good to know. Thanks.|-Wait, what?.
{6737}{6787}And our good friends, Don and Gwen...
{6791}{6836}...Kwan-Li...
{6840}{6876}...Jerry, Otis.
{6884}{6922}Dad...
{6935}{6959}...what about....
{6963}{7007}-What about Ben?.|-Oh, no, no, no.
{7030}{7131}Oh, and of course, there's|Sadie's affable boyfriend, Ben.
{7157}{7193}But what I really want to do...
{7197}{7255}...is thank my beautiful wife...
{7269}{7385}...without whom this life|would mean nothing.
{7390}{7452}Happy 30th anniversary.
{7513}{7552}-I love you.|-I love you too.
{7556}{7605}And I hope there are 30 more.
{7609}{7667}Well, that makes one of us.
{7877}{7935}Excuse me.|Could I have everyone's attention, please?.
{7977}{8013}I just wanted to....
{8168}{8233}Well, I thought since|everyone was gathered...
{8237}{8286}...gathered already....
{8361}{8394}Oh, my God.
{8429}{8452}Oh, my God.
{8457}{8503}-Sadie...|-Oh, my God, oh, my God.
{8507}{8546}...Wilhelmina Jones.
{8589}{8707}In front of God and your family...
{8715}{8853}...Kwan-Li, and Jerry and Otis and....
{8903}{8956}I just want to know...
{8960}{9031}...if you would spend the rest|of your life with me.
{9091}{9116}But I don't....
{9121}{9173}I don't want to put you|on the spot or anything.
{9177}{9296}Benjamin Murphy, I would marry you|tomorrow in a potato-sack dress...
{9301}{9406}...in the middle of a rainstorm, if it meant|I could spend the rest of my life with you.
{9540}{9569}Wait a second.
{9593}{9744}You choose our 30th wedding anniversary|to propose to my daughter?.
{9810}{9845}Well...
{9857}{9903}...we couldn't be happier.
{9907}{9958}Oh, my gosh.
{9962}{9991}I know.
{10035}{10082}New brother-in-law-to-be, I guess.
{10086}{10137}-Oh, man. Hey, hello.|-Awkward.
{10141}{10186}-Welcome.|-Thank you.
{10232}{10283}-Welcome to the family, Ben.|-Sir. All right!
{10287}{10347}-Oh, my baby.|-Oh, honey, I'm so happy for you.
{10351}{10400}Look at this beautiful ring.
{10405}{10454}Sadie, Sadie, I was thinking....
{10464}{10551}I think we should have the wedding|somewhere tropical. I was thinking, like...
{10555}{10590}...the Caribbean.
{10594}{10636}I have this one thing.
{10687}{10723}Okay.
{10727}{10766}I always wanted|to get married here.
{10800}{10868}Here.|What do you mean?.
{10872}{10901}At Saint Augustine's.
{10905}{10989}It's this fantasy I've had|since I was a little girl.
{10993}{11038}It's the church where|John and I married.
{11042}{11121}Where Sadie was christened by|Reverend Frank, who's known us forever.
{11125}{11201}More importantly, it's the church|Sadie's grandfather built.
{11232}{11259}Her dead grandfather.
{11263}{11357}Oh, give me a break.|All he built was a door after it was stolen.
{11361}{11412}How would you know?.|You weren't married there.
{11416}{11467}And we all know|how that marriage turned out.
{11471}{11506}Mom!
{11510}{11573}-Stop.|-Here, here, here, here.
{11577}{11634}Babe, you've made me so|unbelievably happy today.
{11638}{11662}You have no idea.
{11667}{11700}-Great.|-Yeah.
{11704}{11766}Then Saint Augustine's...
{11770}{11841}-...is the decision.|-Thank you, I love you.
{11849}{11897}-You ready?.|-I'm missing a shoe.
{11901}{11963}-Well, where did you last see it?.|-I don't know.
{11967}{12027}You know, Ben,|your sweater's actually inside out?.
{12031}{12079}Gotta fix that.
{12083}{12115}What would you do without me?.
{12119}{12176}You want the short list or the long list?.
{12180}{12225}Oh, and your belt?.
{12229}{12278}-It's a little funny.|-No, my beIt's fine.
{12325}{12349}Wait a minute.
{12353}{12402}-We're gonna be really late.|-No, we're not.
{12406}{12436}Yeah, we are.
{12440}{12488}And your point is?.
{12696}{12725}How do I look?.
{12729}{12792}-You look like you've just been--|-All right, never mind.
{12797}{12841}We're so going to hell, you know that?.
{12845}{12935}-Hey, here's the door Grandpa built.|-Wow, he does really good work.
{13314}{13358}Don't touch that!
{13366}{13409}Jesus! You scared me.
{13419}{13479}Jesus didn't scare you, I did.
{13501}{13583}-Hi, I'm Sadie--|-Sadie Jones. Yes, I know.
{13587}{13630}You have a 1 0:30 with Reverend Frank.
{13635}{13666}Yeah. Is he here?.
{13688}{13727}Reverend Frank is everywhere.
{13731}{13771}Follow me.
{13881}{13923}"Dear ELLE magazine:
{13927}{13987}I just found out that my husband|of three months...
{13991}{14050}...is cheating on me with my best friend.
{14054}{14148}Half of me wants to kill him, the other|half wants to salvage my marriage.
{14152}{14177}What to do?. "
{14181}{14205}Yikes.
{14209}{14264}What kind of sins are we|dealing with here, guys?.
{14268}{14324}-Sarah.|-Thou shall not commit adultery?.
{14328}{14402}Adultery. Going out for milk|when you have jugs at home.
{14406}{14456}Show me adultery!
{14491}{14547}Not neat to cheat! Okay!
{14551}{14588}Now, a lot of people ask me:
{14593}{14660}"What if I'm cheating with a woman|who's really, really ugly?.
{14664}{14696}Does that make it all right?. "
{14700}{14766}No, it does not make it all right.|It is still a sin.
{14778}{14819}What other sins?. Anybody?.
{14823}{14889}Don't hesitate to draw on|your parents' bad examples.
{14893}{14968}-Laurie. Bring it, girl.|-Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife.
{14973}{15053}Starts with coveting, ends with the clap.
{15057}{15104}Okay, coveting thy neighbor's wife.
{15108}{15178}That's why God invented|the cold shower. Show me coveting!
{15245}{15281}Good one, Laurie!
{15285}{15364}Okay, there's one answer left on the board.|Let's see.
{15368}{15401}Manny.
{15455}{15499}Make your two moms proud.
{15550}{15624}Come on, Manny,|you can murder this one.
{15647}{15744}While I'm waiting, maybe I'll just|fashion a shiv out of Cindy's barrette.
{15793}{15850}Take a stab at it.
{15908}{15947}Thou shall not kill?.
{15957}{16011}Boom, Manny!|Bang, bang, bang!
{16042}{16085}Show me thou shall not kill!
{16123}{16192}Oh, good one, Manny!|Manny, Manny, Manny.
{16196}{16223}That's it for today.
{16227}{16281}Next we're gonna take|a trip to Arlington Park.
{16285}{16352}We're gonna find out about|the evils of gambling firsthand.
{16356}{16395}So bring at least a dollar...
{16399}{16479}...and remember to ask Mom and Dad|what a trifecta is.
{16565}{16628}I don't know if you remember me,|Reverend Frank, but....
{16633}{16678}Sadie Jones?.
{16682}{16728}Little Sadie Jones.
{16732}{16773}-How you've grown.|-Well, yeah.
{16777}{16835}And now my Sadie Jones|is gonna tie the knot.
{16839}{16863}I am.
{16867}{16921}I'm sorry I haven't been around|for the last....
{16925}{16948}Ten years.
{16953}{16976}Yeah.
{16981}{17027}I've just been trying to get|my business--
{17031}{17063}Oh, please.
{17068}{17122}You go to college,|you have a bisexual roommate...
{17126}{17170}...you forget about God.|Don't sweat it.
{17174}{17205}He doesn't forget about you.
{17269}{17304}Who are you?.
{17325}{17348}I'm Ben.
{17353}{17376}-Ben.|-Hi.
{17381}{17445}So, what do you do,|besides little Sadie here?.
{17510}{17534}How are you?.
{17545}{17614}All right, let's get the flock out of here.|Come on.
{17618}{17656}So, how long you two been an item?.
{17661}{17707}-About....|-Like....
{17711}{17755}Yeah!
{17805}{17847}It's been teetering there for weeks.
{17851}{17886}-Cheesy Curl?.|-No, thank you.
{17890}{17938}Too bad, they're addicting.
{18034}{18076}-Booked.|-Booked. Booked.
{18080}{18118}Nothing there or there.
{18122}{18154}I am popular.
{18158}{18206}Yes, you are.
{18225}{18290}All full. Not looking good. No.
{18322}{18389}No, no, no.
{18393}{18470}-Nope, nope, nope.|-Booked, booked, booked.
{18691}{18728}Bad news, guys.
{18732}{18794}-Next available date is in two years.|-Two years?.
{18819}{18843}That's...
{18859}{18901}-...so long.|-Yeah.
{18925}{18964}Wait.
{18974}{19029}-Hold on, hold on.|-Wasn't there a cancellation?.
{19045}{19102}-I think it's--|-There, there!
{19106}{19134}Yes, there it is.
{19138}{19188}Three weeks from tomorrow, how is that?.
{19237}{19295}That's a little quick.|Right?. I mean....
{19349}{19405}Okay, I guess we're getting married|in three weeks.
{19409}{19450}Okay.
{19454}{19485}-Just like that?.|-Yeah.
{19489}{19584}-So it is written, so it shall be done.|-So it shall be done.
{19590}{19643}Oh, boy.
{19647}{19687}All right.
{19693}{19748}One small thing.
{19752}{19837}Couple years ago I instituted|a marriage preparation course here.
{19841}{19906}The course is a prerequisite|for all marriage ceremonies...
{19910}{19966}...performed on these grounds.
{19972}{20036}At the end of the course,|if I feel you're unprepared...
{20040}{20149}...or you stop the course before completion,|I have the right to call off the wedding.
{20153}{20260}I'm sorry, but this isn't mandatory, right?.|Because we're so ready to get married.
{20265}{20315}-More than most.|-We strongly advise it.
{20319}{20369}In other words, you have no choice.
{20377}{20417}With the divorce rate what it is....
{20421}{20449}50 percent.
{20453}{20506}Much higher for those|who live together first.
{20514}{20566}You did say you lived together, right?.
{20603}{20648}I'm sorry, who are you again?.
{20652}{20702}I'm part of the Ministers|of Tomorrow program.
{20706}{20747}Reverend Frank's my mentor.
{20751}{20781}My little Mensa.
{20785}{20830}-I can see.|-Listen, kids.
{20834}{20898}We wanna make sure you|are making the right decision...
{20902}{20961}...because your future happiness|depends on it.
{20965}{21017}Reverend Frank has a hundred|percent success...
{21021}{21074}...for those that make it|through the course.
{21078}{21137}-But what about the people who--?.|-Okay, we'll do it.
{21166}{21216}-We're gonna do it.|-We're doing that?.
{21220}{21255}-It's awesome.|-We're doing this.
{21260}{21285}That's my Sadie.
{21301}{21387}All right, we have three months of prep|to cram into three weeks.
{21391}{21427}There's only a few rules.
{21431}{21501}Rule number one:|you each have to write your own vows.
{21505}{21557}You have a booklet,|and you share these vows...
{21561}{21614}...with each other at the ceremony.
{21639}{21693}-That's really cool.|-lsn't it?.
{21697}{21733}Okay. What's rule number two?.
{21737}{21793}Starting immediately,|no sex until the honeymoon.
{21841}{21880}I....
{22019}{22045}Are you serious?.
{22059}{22090}Oh, yeah.
{22144}{22184}Tomorrow morning,|bright and early.
{22188}{22212}Be there.
{22216}{22257}We all remember the 1 1 th Commandment.
{22261}{22291}I don't.
{22313}{22353}Thou shall not be late.
{22438}{22493}We've got a hundred things|to start, but it's doable.
{22497}{22548}I just have to get Carlisle on the phone.
{22552}{22644}-He was kidding about the no-sex thing?.|-Carlisle?. It's me. Get ready for this.
{22648}{22709}-We will talk about the no-sex thing later.|-Okay, Ben.
{22713}{22755}No sex?.
{22759}{22829}That's supposed to happen|after you get married.
{22837}{22862}Joel, I come here...
{22866}{22922}-...for your compassion.|-I'm just giving you shit.
{22926}{22986}Congratulations.|You are going to love marriage.
{22990}{23036}Damn it, Joel.|What is wrong with you?.
{23040}{23091}You were supposed to be|watching them.
{23095}{23134}Shelly, baby, I'm on the roof.
{23138}{23202}Remember we said you won't|bother me when I'm on the roof?.
{23206}{23256}-You're always on the roof.|-Exactly.
{23261}{23304}-I heard that.|-Yeah.
{23308}{23353}Where did this mud hole|even come from?.
{23357}{23421}Oh, my God,|I am so getting my tubes tied.
{23425}{23525}This reverend says he wants me to meet|him after church tomorrow one-on-one.
{23544}{23582}What is that?.
{23586}{23634}You ever done that?.|The marriage prep stuff?.
{23638}{23712}To tell you the truth, I don't remember|anything before D-day, man.
{23727}{23764}It's like a black hole.
{23769}{23827}All I know is that's my wife...
{23831}{23871}...apparently those are my kids...
{23875}{23942}...and this, this is my beer.
{23946}{24012}Everything else is pretty much a blur.
{24026}{24052}Yeah.
{24073}{24104}Thank you.
{24108}{24144}That's why you're my best man.
{24170}{24213}Two words for your bachelor party:
{24217}{24255}Strippers and Sizzler.
{24292}{24337}I like to call it "beef and booty."
{24341}{24392}I heard that.
{24445}{24469}Oh, boy.
{24607}{24661}Please, God, let somebody|be later than us.
{24665}{24768}Hey. We'll just sneak in the back,|no one will notice.
{24777}{24815}We also ask...
{24819}{24916}...that you watch over the Mansbridge|meat packers and their labor dispute.
{24920}{25006}Grant our packers patience|as they await an amicable resolution...
{25016}{25097}...with, Lord willing,|a four to six percent pay increase...
{25101}{25145}...and dental would be nice.
{25266}{25329}Look who decided to show.
{25385}{25456}Choir! Let me hear it!
{25461}{25548}You're late, you're late|You're late, you're late
{25553}{25629}God's on time
{25633}{25720}But you are very late
{25765}{25839}It's your first offense.|We'll let it slide.
{25845}{25918}It happens again, I'm telling the Big Guy.
{25922}{25992}And I'm not talking about|Larry Carmichael over there on drums.
{26025}{26070}But seriously...
{26079}{26138}...Iet us re-pray.
{26168}{26247}Sorry for bailing, Lord.|A brief interruption, but we're back.
{26251}{26297}We'd also like to pray for Walter...
{26301}{26355}...recently returned from his|holiday in Thailand.
{26359}{26399}Let's hope it's just a heat rash.
{26421}{26475}-Vivian.|-I don't know how you do it, Frank.
{26479}{26530}Every week your sermons|get better and better.
{26534}{26614}It comes from upstairs, Vivian.|I'm just the TiVo.
{26631}{26664}It wasn't that good.
{26668}{26696}-You ready?.|-Yeah.
{26727}{26770}I have to go. I have stuff to do...
{26774}{26831}...but you guys enjoy|your man-talk, okay?.
{26835}{26884}Don't say anything about me|behind my back.
{26889}{26949}You'll never know so....
{26961}{26988}Tight.
{26993}{27031}-Sorry?.|-The car.
{27043}{27097}-Hi.|-Bye.
{27121}{27170}You ready?. A little one-on-one?.
{27174}{27214}-Yeah.|-Come on. Let's go.
{27218}{27261}The name of our team is the Crusaders.
{27265}{27365}I didn't want to tell the kids about the|Children's Crusades, it bums them out.
{27369}{27417}Wow, you really meant one-on-one.
{27421}{27460}Oh, yeah.
{27469}{27501}-A little hoops?.|-No.
{27505}{27532}This ball needs Viagra.
{27566}{27606}-Play catch?.|-Sure, love catch.
{27610}{27664}It's my favorite sport.
{27668}{27722}Pardon the glove.|We've had a few budget cutbacks.
{27726}{27766}-Oh, that's all right.|-Back up.
{27780}{27809}Okay.
{27813}{27874}What are you, a little girl's softball league?.|Back up.
{27878}{27912}Okay. Not a little girl.
{27916}{27948}-Yeah.|-All right.
{27952}{27997}It's nice to be able to chat with you...
{28001}{28078}...without all this "I'm a pastor|who can send you to hell" nonsense.
{28088}{28116}No, me too. This is great.
{28121}{28175}Little one-on-one time|with your spiritual elder.
{28197}{28244}Bless you, Benjamin.
{28271}{28330}-Too hard?.|-No. That's a....
{28334}{28375}That's a good burn. Right?.
{28379}{28445}Anything that's painful|makes you stronger.
{28449}{28517}Not really. You break your leg,|your leg doesn't get stronger.
{28521}{28574}God is just, but God is kind.
{28623}{28672}That's a nice sentiment.
{28690}{28731}Thank you.|Can I ask you something?.
{28735}{28771}-Sure.|-Sadie.
{28775}{28813}Why do you love her?.
{28845}{28889}There's just so many reasons, you know?.
{28893}{28952}She's beautiful, inside and out.
{28956}{28997}So, I'm lucky.
{29001}{29050}What do you mean by "inside"?.
{29078}{29115}You meant spiritually, right?.
{29119}{29160}Yep. Exactly.
{29164}{29212}Okay. What else?.
{29257}{29347}She's just smart, you know?.|She's motivated, she's well-organized.
{29351}{29397}She's probably|the hardest worker I know.
{29422}{29491}Well, let me get this straight, then.|Correct me if I'm wrong.
{29495}{29570}First thing you like about her is her looks.|But you really think...
{29574}{29631}-...she's a cute control freak.|-I didn't say that.
{29635}{29745}-I know what you're getting at.|-"Organized" is code for OCD.
{29749}{29787}OCD is a--
{29791}{29817}God!
{29865}{29916}Oh, my Lord.
{29931}{29964}-You okay, big fella?.|-Yeah.
{29968}{29996}Oh, yeah?.
{30000}{30035}-How you doing--|-Totally fine.
{30039}{30099}Let's see that. Come on.|Oh, no. That's bad.
{30103}{30134}I'm gonna have to heal you.
{30148}{30202}-No, that's okay.|-No. I'm gonna have to heal you.
{30206}{30263}-I just need Advil.|-It's healing time. Stay down.
{30267}{30313}Stay down. It's healing time.
{30324}{30365}-What's that mean?.|-Oh, Jesus Christ.
{30369}{30442}Oh, Lord, surround him|with your light and grace.
{30446}{30483}Lord have mercy!
{30487}{30543}-The power of Christ compels you!|-Lord have mercy.
{30547}{30586}The power of Christ compels you!
{30590}{30646}-We have got to pray!|-Pray!
{30650}{30688}-We have got to pray!|-Pray!
{30692}{30743}We have got to pray to make it|through the day!
{30757}{30781}Is that MC Hammer?.
{30791}{30863}-You're healed, right?.|-Let me see. Let me see.
{30867}{30948}-No, it's still bleeding.|-Let's go old school.
{31002}{31057}Begone, demon spirit!
{31061}{31102}Begone!
{31132}{31204}-That's not helping at all.|-Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
{31208}{31247}Lord, take him up upon your wing--
{31251}{31312}-Wait, take me where?.|-lf you believed, you'd be healed.
{31317}{31350}-Do you believe?.|-Believe!
{31354}{31404}-Believe!|-I'm healed, I'm healed, I'm healed.
{31409}{31475}-Oh, it's a miracle! It's a miracle!|-lt is. It is.
{31479}{31534}You're not healed.|I'm not a doctor, I'm a pastor.
{31538}{31606}You know what you need?.|Advil and ice. Come on.
{31610}{31705}-Check him out, just see that he's okay.|-The nasal septum and concha are clear.
{31709}{31792}-Good news, kid. Your nose is fine.|-Yeah, come on. Let me buy you a Coke.
{31797}{31855}Sorry about that.|You know, I have to try that stuff.
{31859}{31934}-Never works, but what if it had?.|-Yeah.
{31938}{31981}-Wouldn't that be crazy?.|-Crazy.
{32011}{32060}It was great.
{32065}{32127}Yes, totally.|Reverend Frank is the best.
{32131}{32204}Listen, tomorrow night, I was th--
{32217}{32291}Group counseling for what?.
{32423}{32456}Okay, like we do every week.
{32460}{32524}Danny, pick up Tenika|and carry her across that threshold.
{32528}{32559}Yeah, that's it!
{32563}{32619}Try and think of it like the first time.
{32623}{32674}For a lot of you,|that wasn't the honeymoon.
{32709}{32767}Yeah, baby. Come on, Jim.
{32771}{32799}My back is giving out.
{32803}{32832}Don't focus on the pain.
{32836}{32911}Look at the love that|Janine's giving you right now.
{32915}{32977}And if that doesn't work,|think about potato skins.
{32990}{33038}God, I love potato skins.
{33042}{33093}A husband will do anything|for appetizers.
{33097}{33123}Yes.
{33164}{33227}Everybody, I want to introduce you|to two new members.
{33231}{33300}This is Ben and Sadie.|They're getting married in three weeks.
{33304}{33362}Ben, why don't you carry Sadie|across the threshold?.
{33376}{33412}Come on.
{33421}{33490}Come on. Yeah, come on.
{33510}{33562}Yeah, there you go.|Get across that threshold!
{33718}{33759}Hurry.
{33779}{33861}-Oh, great.|-Look.
{34414}{34456}Got it.
{34553}{34580}Tonight...
{34585}{34647}...we learn how to fight fairly.
{34663}{34687}Sorry.
{34691}{34747}What if we've never had a fight before?.
{34769}{34829}-Seriously think I'm gonna puke.|-Louise, no puking.
{34833}{34896}They're young.|They're allowed to be enthusiastic.
{34909}{34966}Never had a fight,|it's about time you had one.
{34970}{35028}So please, step up|to the top of the circle.
{35032}{35077}Come on, get your butts up there!
{35081}{35147}Let's get this perfect relationship|on its feet.
{35151}{35205}Put it to the test. Okay.
{35209}{35250}I want you to imagine.
{35254}{35312}You're driving in the mountains.|It's nighttime.
{35316}{35361}But there's a torrential downpour.
{35365}{35406}That thing with the wipers like this:
{35422}{35469}You're tired. You're lost.
{35479}{35512}You're getting cranky.
{35523}{35567}What was that?.
{35571}{35627}You got a flat tire|because you just hit a pothole.
{35636}{35688}Instant argument potential.
{35693}{35734}What do you do?. How do you handle it?.
{35749}{35796}I think we'd probably just call AAA.
{35825}{35908}Out of cell phone range.|Can't use the cell phone. Can't call AAA.
{35912}{35989}You gotta handle it the old-fashioned way.|You gotta change the tire.
{35993}{36061}You're pissed at each other. Go.
{36129}{36206}Sorry I didn't see that pothole.
{36217}{36254}It's okay, honey.
{36258}{36329}Accidents happen,|so just be more careful next time.
{36333}{36383}-Promise I will.|-Cut!
{36387}{36460}You guys travel medicated?.|That was like "Prozac Takes a Vacation."
{36465}{36505}That's not what we're looking for.
{36509}{36608}Janine, why don't you and Jimbo show|them how this argument should play out?.
{36612}{36648}Sure.
{36754}{36789}Hey, jackass!
{36793}{36872}I told you to take Route 45,|but again, you didn't listen!
{36876}{36978}Now it's pissing down outside|and we're stuck God only knows where.
{36982}{37052}Yeah, well, if we hadn't|left three hours late...
{37056}{37151}...because someone was talking|to her ball-busting mother on the phone...
{37164}{37226}...well, then, maybe we wouldn't|be in this position!
{37230}{37291}You are a sad, sad man.
{37295}{37370}You will not emasculate me anymore.
{37374}{37426}-Go to hell!|-No, you go to hell, Janine.
{37430}{37508}-Go to hell.|-Okay. Cut.
{37524}{37571}Everybody, Jim and Janine.
{37626}{37682}We're gonna try something|a little different now.
{37686}{37748}We're gonna do role reversal.
{37762}{37794}All right.
{37798}{37842}Sadie, I want you to be Ben.
{37846}{37908}Ben, I want you to be Sadie.|Come on. Step up there.
{37913}{37952}Come on, get up! Yeah!
{37957}{38011}-Oh, gosh.|-Come on.
{38015}{38050}You're gonna change the tire.
{38054}{38097}Ben, tire's down here.
{38101}{38156}You're down in that muck.|Here's your lug wrench.
{38160}{38212}The lugs are right here.|But they're tight.
{38216}{38309}They're rusty, they're old, all right?.|You can't get them off and you're angry...
{38313}{38403}...and you're cold, and you really--|You wanna tear each other apart.
{38407}{38443}Go.
{38489}{38537}Don't you wish|we were in cell-phone range?.
{38541}{38604}Then we could just call|AAA like we always do.
{38608}{38692}-Yeah, I don't know how we got so lost.|-I don't either.
{38696}{38745}Ben, maybe we wouldn't|have gotten lost...
{38749}{38849}...if you had just followed the TripTik|that I prepared three days in advance.
{38853}{38933}Well, I thought that I was following|the road signs pretty well.
{38937}{39011}Just going with the flow, as usual.
{39049}{39093}What was that?.|What was that last thing?.
{39097}{39173}I'm just going along for the ride.
{39177}{39242}Who was?. You. As me.
{39281}{39337}Well, I'm not really sure|how anything gets done...
{39341}{39462}...if people aren't following my|very specific instructions, Ben.
{39469}{39529}But I love it when you're in charge.
{39533}{39615}That way I don't have to|take too much responsibility, Sadie.
{39619}{39712}Ben, don't you know that that's the only|way things get done around here?.
{39727}{39776}That's how things get done around here?.|Good.
{39781}{39814}I had no idea.
{39818}{39865}-Thank you.|-Want me to show you?.
{39869}{39946}-He said counter--|-I think I have it under control!
{40043}{40081}Dear Jesus!
{40085}{40144}-Potato skins down!|-Jim, Jim--
{40197}{40253}Come on, everybody!
{40258}{40320}Five-second rule!
{40339}{40371}Janine!
{40408}{40451}Okay.|We'll pick up next week...
{40455}{40511}...with balancing|the joint checking account.
{40674}{40745}So are you writing your vows later or...?.
{40749}{40810}No, I finished earlier.
{40829}{40892}Hey, what color white should we|go with for the napkins?.
{40896}{40929}There's ivory...
{40933}{40966}...and timid.
{40991}{41022}Ivory.
{41026}{41145}I don't know, I kind of feel like it might|clash with the pistachio in the centerpieces.
{41149}{41265}All right, well, you know what?.|I'll just ask Carlisle tomorrow.
{41281}{41351}Yeah, you know who else you could ask?|Reverend Frank.
{41355}{41396}Because he loves giving his opinion.
{41400}{41435}Why do you say it like that?
{41439}{41478}I don 't know. Maybe because...
{41482}{41541}-...he' s just a little bit--|-Knowledgeable.
{41545}{41616}-Yeah.|-" lntrusive." I was gonna go with intrusive.
{41654}{41710}Ben, he's not intrusive, you know?.|He's just...
{41714}{41783}...observing our relationship right now.
{41791}{41890}-Like a voyeur.|-Reverend Frank is not like a voyeur.
{41895}{41954}-A little bit.|-No, he's not.
{42013}{42074}What was that?. What are you doing?.
{42078}{42119}Do you want to walk the midget?.
{42123}{42150}Course I do, but...
{42154}{42248}...I don 't think we should, because it's|against the rules until after the wedding.
{42270}{42314}-Are you serious?.|-Yes.
{42323}{42384}-You're actually following that rule?.|-Yeah.
{42389}{42470}Because I want to pass the course.|Don't you?.
{42489}{42550}-Yes, I want to pass the course.|-So?.
{42554}{42656}So, I also want to play Pickle Me, Tickle Me|with my really hot fiancee.
{42690}{42726}Okay?.
{42730}{42796}-Come on.|-What?.
{42800}{42831}No one else is gonna know.
{42835}{42916}I'll know, Ben. I will know.|So just--
{42920}{42957}Just please...
{42961}{43052}...Iet's stick to the program for now.|Okay?. Thank you.
{43086}{43140}Three weeks never killed anyone.
{43144}{43189}Really?.|Has that ever been documented?.
{43193}{43228}Good night.
{43342}{43386}Good night, Ben.
{43587}{43654}Okay, I'm a cigar vendor....
{43694}{43738}-What?.|-Go to bed.
{43742}{43782}Thank you.
{43861}{43903}What if I'm not tired?.
{43919}{43959}Yes!
{43963}{43989}All clear.
{43993}{44060}-What'd I miss?.|-None of your business.
{44064}{44145}-But they're right on schedule.|-Their optimism is touching.
{44149}{44211}They remind me of the Anderson couple|we had last month.
{44215}{44264}Yeah. You know what time it is?.
{44275}{44308}Time to turn up the heat.
{44312}{44369}It's time to build on the foundation|we've set up.
{44398}{44444}Remind me never to cross you.
{44677}{44728}I mean, I'm really glad|we're doing the course.
{44733}{44793}I just wish Ben would take it|more seriously, you know?.
{44797}{44845}What about these|in my bouquet, Lindsey?.
{44849}{44878}No.
{44882}{44913}No?.
{44917}{45028}I just want to feel some enthusiasm|from him, or is that expecting too much?.
{45033}{45101}Sadie, you have so much|to learn about men.
{45112}{45152}Pink.
{45181}{45246}Flowers by Sadie, Sadie speaking.
{45266}{45303}Meet where?.
{45307}{45353}I didn't even want to take this course...
{45357}{45418}...and now she's following it|to, like, the nth degree.
{45422}{45491}Where are the cheerleaders?.|Shouldn't they be practicing too?.
{45495}{45574}Come on, Famaletti! Deny that baseline!
{45578}{45641}Coach Murphy, you were right|to put him on B-squad.
{45645}{45711}-Get ready, Zach.|-Or maybe I'm just overreacting.
{45715}{45788}I mean, give and take, that's a part of|every healthy relationship.
{45797}{45824}Give and what?.
{45828}{45868}-Give and take.|-Man, listen to me.
{45879}{45964}Once a woman senses she has control,|she'll tell a thousand of her friends.
{45969}{46064}Then they'll want control too.|"l want a little piece of this control stuff."
{46069}{46168}Next thing you know, they'll be running|companies and having their own offices.
{46172}{46262}Do not set dangerous precedents|for other men.
{46324}{46364}Hello?.
{46380}{46404}Late for what?.
{46408}{46509}Welcome to Saint Catherine's Maternity,|birthplace to over 4000 babies each year.
{46513}{46588}That's almost 80 babies a week,|and we've never misplaced one.
{46592}{46616}Okay, maybe one.
{46633}{46705}If you're shy, get your tubes tied now|and call it a day.
{46709}{46771}A woman in labor basically|lies around almost naked...
{46775}{46860}...while dozens of doctors and nurses|get a front row view of her wide open--
{46865}{46921}Virginia! Put some gloves|on those hands right now!
{46925}{46962}We're not delivering pizzas here.
{46966}{47052}Labor could last anywhere from|a few hours to a few days.
{47069}{47174}And that's not even counting the nine|months of constipation leading up to it.
{47178}{47219}Of course, there's always drugs...
{47223}{47294}...so you should figure out how|you feel about that beforehand.
{47305}{47338}I-- Oh, God!
{47342}{47405}And then be ready to toss|that decision out the window...
{47409}{47480}...when the pain really kicks in.
{47501}{47557}A woman in labor|wouldn't even feel that.
{47561}{47599}Good to know.
{47603}{47627}Or that.
{47631}{47661}This way.
{47665}{47712}You squeamish, Ben?.
{47724}{47758}Little bit, I guess.
{47762}{47832}You have to figure out if you're|gonna be in the delivery room.
{47836}{47872}Oh, yeah, of course he will be.
{47877}{47900}Yes.
{47905}{47959}Some men are so traumatized|by the experience...
{47963}{48034}...they can never look at their wives|the same again.
{48038}{48075}Sexually, that is.
{48079}{48143}Give me some slow, deep breaths.
{48147}{48186}How many do you want to have?.
{48190}{48222}-Four?.|-Two?.
{48249}{48308}Big push. Big push.
{48312}{48364}I need an epidural!
{48372}{48450}Look at her! She's breathing fine!
{48457}{48486}What about me?.
{48537}{48598}They say for a man to experience|the equivalent pain...
{48602}{48654}...you'd have to pull your scrotum|over your head.
{48682}{48713}That was incredible.
{48717}{48749}Glad you feel that way.
{48753}{48812}Because now the real fun begins.
{48822}{48864}Welcome to the world of parenting.
{48868}{48944}-They breathe, they blink, they cry.|-And they're all yours.
{48955}{49037}Congratulations, you've just had twins.
{49123}{49178}Look at how their little chests|move up and down.
{49182}{49263}Yeah. Their creepy little chests.
{49267}{49334}And you really want four of these things?.
{49347}{49414}I think it'd be nice to have|a big family, don't you?.
{49418}{49473}Yeah. No, no, definitely.
{49477}{49501}Well, I mean...
{49505}{49569}...four might be kind of|a big commitment.
{49692}{49760}Okay, do you want to take that?.
{49769}{49860}No, you can do it. Come on.
{49933}{49977}Just pat him on the back really gently.
{49981}{50012}Okay.
{50016}{50053}Poor little baby.
{50057}{50134}Little creepy robot baby.
{50193}{50232}Oh, my God!
{50286}{50337}-God.|-Hold on.
{50357}{50389}-Here you go.|-Stop, stop.
{50393}{50438}Hold on, hold on. There you go.
{50442}{50495}-There's some on his shirt too.|-Okay.
{50499}{50551}We can't forget to set the alarm for 8...
{50555}{50623}...because we're going to Macy's|to register for the wedding.
{50627}{50683}Wait, we're not bringing these|with us, are we?.
{50687}{50756}Come on, can't we just, like,|phone in our order or something?.
{50760}{50864}No, we're so jammed this week,|tomorrow's the only day we can do it.
{50969}{51022}Look at that. Fell back asleep.
{51041}{51073}So I did it.
{51077}{51140}Looks like this parenting thing|isn't as hard as they say.
{51145}{51188}See?. You're a natural.
{51192}{51216}Thanks.
{51220}{51244}Night.
{51357}{51429}Ben?. Ben!
{51433}{51475}Ben!
{51484}{51512}Ben!
{51516}{51565}Okay, I'm coming.
{51569}{51612}What?. Hi.
{51616}{51682}How many times do I have to knock, man?.|How you doing?.
{51687}{51717}-Good.|-Good morning.
{51721}{51765}-Shelly's dad fell off a ladder.|-What?.
{51769}{51832}And unfortunately, he's gonna make it.|So we have to go...
{51837}{51891}...and you are on brat patrol|for a couple hours.
{51895}{51942}Thank you. Appreciate it.|Thanks a million.
{52105}{52153}Hi.
{52168}{52217}Which one's the biter?.
{52221}{52314}All you have to do is point the gun at|the item you want and then pull the trigger.
{52318}{52411}The computer instantly logs it in our registry|database for your guests to consider.
{52415}{52471}There's no limit to how many|items I can choose?.
{52475}{52524}-When in doubt, zap it.|-Great.
{52528}{52567}We only have a couple hours so....
{52571}{52628}Chop-chop. Come on.
{52645}{52717}Okay. All right. Yep.
{52721}{52765}Guys, guys, guys,|slow down, slow down.
{52769}{52815}Hey. All right, that's good.
{52819}{52904}Now we're going faster.|Stop, stop. Hello?.
{52908}{52938}All right, guys. All right.
{52942}{53027}The yelling needs to hold off. All right.
{53044}{53107}Hey, Ben, what do you like better?.|The blue or the beige?.
{53111}{53149}The beige or the blue?.
{53153}{53212}- I like the blue. Blue's good.|-Beige goes better...
{53216}{53245}...with the placemats.
{53256}{53298}Or beige. Let's just do beige.
{53302}{53337}I love beige.
{53352}{53391}Beige it is.
{53614}{53656}-Do you like this one?.|-It's great.
{53661}{53733}-All right, let's get this one.|-Yeah, let's get a couple.
{53797}{53849}Oh, I just got this text message|from Carlisle.
{53853}{53890}I got the wrong dinnerware.
{53894}{53962}-Do you mean silverware?. Can we just go?.|-No, dinnerware.
{54017}{54084}-No way. That is not simulated.|-God, that's bad.
{54132}{54178}Well, why don't you change the diaper...
{54182}{54220}...and I'll go get the dinnerware?.
{54225}{54288}-Why don't we think about....|-Okay.
{54393}{54417}Okay.
{55244}{55281}Yeah.
{55353}{55403}Stop! Oh, God!
{55407}{55459}Stop, stop!
{55487}{55565}Should we get the 500-thread count?.|Ben, can you slow down a little bit?.
{55569}{55619}Oh, I'm trying.
{55743}{55777}Oh, my God.
{55781}{55805}Sorry. Ben?.
{55809}{55856}-Give me one, please?.|-Will you take that?.
{55860}{55895}I'm gonna give you one.
{55899}{55980}-I will help you by getting this one thing--|-I'm sorry.
{55984}{56024}Guys, guys, guys, it's okay.
{56069}{56108}-Come here. Come on, come on.|-Okay.
{56112}{56167}Ben, don't drop him!
{56171}{56215}Here, take the kids. Come on, come on.
{56219}{56255}Boys, let's go. Come on.
{56259}{56337}Hi, I'm looking for some Pima cotton|or Egyptian cotton sheets.
{56341}{56398}Something that really seems to breathe.|I'm sorry.
{56402}{56480}I can't seem to find them over there|and I have--
{56484}{56545}Get off the bed.|All right.
{56593}{56628}Get off the bed.
{56632}{56717}Enough. Okay, enough.|No, no. Okay. Stop!
{56721}{56786}No, no, no.|Guys, no, no, no.
{56790}{56879}Just stop. Sorry.|It's fine. It's just a....
{56883}{56915}Stop.
{56966}{57039}Stop it! Stop, you stupid-- Shut up!
{57043}{57169}Just shut up, shut up, shut up!|Shut up, shut up! Shut it! Shut it!
{57173}{57236}-Hey! What the hell are you doing?.!|-I'm sorry.
{57245}{57294}Thank God. I've had a long day.
{57298}{57357}These are fake. Watch. See?.
{57405}{57440}No, no, no, we're on our way.
{57445}{57545}We just got a little detained at Macy's.|Well, Ben did.
{57549}{57603}For being a public nuisance.
{57607}{57655}It's a long story.
{57659}{57736}Okay. Bye.
{57761}{57793}Well, I'll tell you...
{57797}{57868}...I'm a lot more prepared for kids now.
{57880}{57905}Like way more.
{57909}{57996}Why are there 56 bras on here?.
{58463}{58521}Pour a glass of that for yourself.|Have a glass.
{58525}{58612}All right, I got it. This is it.|You, my dear, look amazing.
{58657}{58701}I can't believe all these cheeses.
{58705}{58765}I know.|I don't even know which to start with.
{58769}{58832}-There are so many.|-It's funny. Cheez Whiz or Velveeta.
{58837}{58908}That's about as complicated|as my cheese dilemmas usually get.
{58912}{58989}I think I prefer the nutty|Comte Saint-Antoine, which is this one.
{58993}{59048}-All right, this is it?.|-From the Basque region...
{59052}{59121}...and go.|Gonna change your life.
{59125}{59219}-Oh, my God. Carlisle.|-Oh, my God. Carlisle. Wait a minute.
{59223}{59307}Ben, Carlisle's totally right.|I mean, this nutty cheese is the way to go.
{59311}{59356}It's so good. You have to try it.
{59360}{59452}-The white one?. Good.|-You were right. You recommended it too.
{59481}{59531}-Hey, everybody.|-Hey!
{59549}{59616}Every time I hear the word|"cheese us," I'm in.
{59620}{59656}Praise Gouda.
{59700}{59757}Look at all of you,|you're all dressed to the nines.
{59761}{59810}Oh, Lindsey, you look fabulous.
{59814}{59881}-Oh, thank you.|-How's life after the big D?.
{59919}{59948}That bad, huh?.
{59955}{60010}Men are a little too hard to train so....
{60014}{60121}Thought I'd stop trying|and live vicariously through Ben's training.
{60168}{60218}Here I was thinking I was|already housebroken.
{60222}{60246}Maybe not.
{60250}{60280}-Cute.|-It's refreshing...
{60284}{60332}...how honest you are.|It doesn't happen...
{60337}{60389}-...that easily for a lot of in-laws.|-Really?.
{60393}{60468}Because I feel like we all|get along really well.
{60472}{60536}You know what, Ben is a wonderful|addition to this family.
{60540}{60575}Wow, thank you.
{60579}{60624}Whatever.|There's a little awkwardness...
{60628}{60679}...but nothing more|than just new family stuff.
{60683}{60746}You know a great way around|new family awkwardness?.
{60750}{60805}-Word association.|-Excuse me?.
{60809}{60860}It's fun, really. You go around the table...
{60865}{60936}...and you pick one word that best|describes each in-law...
{60940}{60990}...then they pick one word|that describes you.
{60994}{61116}-A give and take, kind of an icebreaker--|-I think it sounds so fun. I love games.
{61121}{61156}That's the spirit, Grandma.
{61161}{61205}Ben, start with Grandma.
{61209}{61296}One word to describe Grandma.
{61315}{61392}That word would be...
{61397}{61434}...wisdom.
{61438}{61466}Excellent.
{61470}{61515}Grandma. What about Ben?.
{61538}{61581}Peculiar for his age.
{61585}{61645}Let's just try and stick with one word.
{61651}{61725}-I'd just say peculiar.|-Okay.
{61729}{61785}We have a winner.|Game over. I think.
{61789}{61863}-No, no, come on. What about Lindsey?.|-I don't wanna do it.
{61867}{61928}Don't think.|What's the first word comes to your mind?.
{61933}{61972}Go for it.
{62002}{62037}Blond.
{62041}{62074}-Are you kidding me?.|-Golden.
{62078}{62164}No, gold. No, like you exude gold.|Not dumb, though.
{62169}{62233}-I didn't say dumb.|-You didn't say dumb. You said blond.
{62237}{62279}Okay. Blond Lindsey.
{62283}{62353}Oh, my tur-- Okay, awesome!|Yes, okay, so....
{62393}{62435}Assertive.
{62446}{62540}If you need someone to take the bull|by the horns, Ben's your guy.
{62570}{62607}That's a good one.|Not that good.
{62611}{62684}I mean, she's laughing a little|too hard for it, but good joke.
{62723}{62777}This is terrific.|See how you're breaking the ice?.
{62781}{62843}There's something new happening now.|Take a shot at Dad.
{62847}{62892}-There we go.|-Sadie's dad is....
{62896}{62921}He's outgoing.
{62925}{63000}-Outgoing, like saying "nice."|-That's very fitting.
{63005}{63045}You're not shedding any light.
{63049}{63100}-Come on, you can do better than this.|-Yes.
{63105}{63139}-Let it rip.|-No, no, no.
{63143}{63206}-No, don't push me. I'm not gonna--|-He's asking, Ben.
{63210}{63243}-Go, come on.|-All right.
{63284}{63314}What about pompous?.
{63318}{63421}-I'm a little pompous.|-What's the Wizard of Oz thing?. Pompous.
{63435}{63466}No, I was just kidding.
{63470}{63571}No. No, no, no.|It's all right. I asked for it.
{63575}{63667}I just meant somebody likes|to hear the sound of their own voice.
{63676}{63712}Now you're getting interesting.
{63716}{63754}Pompous dad, back at Ben.
{63758}{63805}-Here it is.|-Okay.
{63821}{63877}-How about vanilla?.|-Whoa, mom!
{63881}{63917}Called you vanilla.
{63921}{63976}Could be bland, I'm not sure,|but it's your call.
{63980}{64085}-Back at mom. Come on, Ben.|-Okay, "Stepford-y." Stepfordy.
{64089}{64156}Stepfordy?. Is that an adjective?.
{64160}{64200}Yeah, it just describes, you know:
{64205}{64290}"Let's just sweep everything under the rug|with a pat on the back, a smile...
{64294}{64366}...and don't forget the glass of champagne|to take the edge off."
{64370}{64404}You're on a roll. Come on.
{64408}{64472}Do we have any problems here?.|If we did, we'd just...
{64477}{64596}...throw some money at it because we|all know there's nothing money can't buy.
{64685}{64737}Can't buy communication like this.
{64775}{64857}Hey, Ben, I thought you were|really great with my family today.
{64861}{64893}Are you making fun of me?.
{64897}{64947}No. No. Course not.
{64951}{64979}It sounded like you were.
{64983}{65034}I'm not making fun of you.|The fact that you...
{65038}{65110}...Iost your mind and embarrassed yourself|in front of everyone.
{65114}{65184}No, that's not making fun of anyone.
{65252}{65313}-Okay.|-What?.
{65320}{65379}-Time for a punishment. Come here.|-No.
{65465}{65488}What are you doing?
{65493}{65576}-What does it look like I'm doing?|-something that's very against the rules.
{65581}{65617}Mayday.
{65761}{65809}Hi. Just in the neighborhood...
{65813}{65870}...thought I'd drop by,|make a little house call.
{65874}{65909}Yeah, of course you were.
{65913}{65976}-Am I interrupting anything?.|-No, no, no. Come on in.
{65980}{66040}-Oh, thanks. Yay.|-Come on in.
{66044}{66125}-Hi.|-I won't overstay my welcome.
{66137}{66200}I just wanted to check|and see if everything was okay...
{66204}{66294}...because after the tasting,|things were a little tense with the in-laws.
{66298}{66342}Nope. No tension here.
{66362}{66397}Can I be frank?.
{66401}{66438}Of course, I'm Frank.
{66442}{66485}Pardon the pun...
{66489}{66566}...but at this stage in the course,|I usually find out that...
{66570}{66646}...a lot of couples resort to sex|as a quick fix for their problems.
{66650}{66727}I just wanna make sure you're|strong enough to resist the temptation.
{66731}{66797}-Yeah. We are.|-Yeah.
{66801}{66857}Does that make you uncomfortable, Ben?.
{66866}{66941}No, I'm not uncomfortable|talking about sex, no.
{66945}{67001}Having you in my living room|talking about sex...
{67005}{67079}...that makes me a little uncomfortable.|Yeah.
{67083}{67135}The number one rule of a good sex life...
{67139}{67180}...is not being so serious.
{67185}{67215}You know, because...
{67219}{67272}...if the humor goes,|there goes the intimacy...
{67276}{67345}...and then there goes the marriage,|then divorce, yada, yada.
{67354}{67401}But there is a remedy.
{67405}{67474}Knowing what your partner likes sexually.|How do you find out?.
{67478}{67545}Well, you ask. That's kind of wonderful.
{67549}{67617}Hey, one little exercise,|then I'm Audi 5000, okay?.
{67631}{67656}Ben.
{67660}{67716}Look at Sadie|and complete this sentence:
{67720}{67771}" I like it when...."
{67870}{67956}-This is ridiculous. I'm not doing it.|-It's not, Ben. Come on, I wanna know.
{67960}{68014}I don't wanna talk about it.|I don't wanna do it.
{68018}{68053}I wanna know.
{68069}{68110}Please.
{68154}{68199}Sadie.
{68223}{68308}I really like it when...
{68321}{68376}...Reverend Frank doesn't|interrupt us before sex.
{68380}{68421}I'm glad I got that off my chest.
{68425}{68463}-Okay.|-That's okay.
{68467}{68536}You're not comfortable with this,|let's show him how to do it.
{68540}{68615}-Don't hold back.|-I like it when it's out of the ordinary...
{68619}{68653}...personally.
{68657}{68745}That's weird, because I always pictured you|as a kind of in-the-bedroom person.
{68749}{68843}-No, not really. No.|-Hi! Whoa! Out of the ordinary?.
{68847}{68876}We're out of the ordinary.
{68881}{68968}Because I remember having sex|on this carpet and I got a rug burn.
{68972}{69001}-Ouch.|-Yeah.
{69005}{69041}One time, though.|It was great...
{69045}{69094}...but it's more the exception|than the rule.
{69098}{69161}-I'm talking about, like, real spontaneity.|-Like what?.
{69165}{69217}Like my parents' bathroom?.
{69221}{69276}Oh, yeah, and everyone's|downstairs having dinner.
{69280}{69337}-Exactly. Or on the beach.|-Under a towel.
{69341}{69401}-At work.|-ln the office supply room.
{69405}{69494}Or maybe at your grandmother's house|while she's in the kitchen making tea.
{69498}{69540}Yes! I love it when you get creative.
{69545}{69602}You have no idea.|I love it when you take control.
{69606}{69639}What do you like about that?.
{69643}{69701}Okay! That's enough of that!
{69705}{69753}Ben, come on. This is just an exercise.
{69757}{69802}-We were talking through it. Yes!|-No. No.
{69806}{69869}Sadie.|Pushups, that's an exercise.
{69887}{69941}No. No, I see|Ben's point of view here.
{69945}{69987}Maybe we're rushing things a bit.
{69991}{70050}Maybe I should pencil in|the date two years from now.
{70055}{70116}-Okay.|-Sorry to bother you. Good night.
{70121}{70255}I'll let myself out. I know the way.|You have a good night. I'm going out now.
{70259}{70321}-What was that?.|-Please.
{70325}{70349}Reverend Frank!
{70386}{70425}So we back on schedule?.
{70429}{70488}He's a reverend.|What did you think was gonna happen?.
{70492}{70561}Well, I can't believe you were|talking to him like that.
{70565}{70699}I can't believe the first man to actually ask|me what I like in bed was my minister.
{71119}{71148}Son of a--
{71617}{71736}Hey, get your butt out the way!|This ain't no damn pedestrian crossing!
{71740}{71792}So you're telling me|he bugged your apartment?.
{71797}{71844}Yes.|And who knows what he heard?.
{71848}{71917}I mean, this guy is sick,|and I can't wait to tell Sadie.
{71921}{71977}-She's gonna freak out.|-You cannot tell Sadie.
{71981}{72056}You think she's gonna believe her|reverend is bugging your bedroom?.
{72060}{72101}Of course she will. I have evidence.
{72105}{72146}Does this bug have his name on it?.
{72150}{72193}No. But--
{72205}{72230}All right.
{72234}{72288}We can talk about this later|if you need to focus.
{72293}{72361}I'm good. This is about you.|Lady in the wheelchair, please!
{72379}{72408}Listen.
{72412}{72468}The lines of communication|have to be shut down...
{72472}{72554}...between you and your woman.|She trusts the reverend completely now.
{72558}{72613}She trusts him so much|she's calling Shelly...
{72617}{72697}...and telling her how we need|to take a course to help our marriage.
{72707}{72763}So I'm supposed to take this lying down?.
{72767}{72841}No. Look, let me make this simple, okay?.
{72846}{72928}We have to punch a hole in Frank's|holier-than-thou armor.
{72932}{73047}We have to find his deepest,|darkest secret and take him down.
{73069}{73108}Roach coach.
{73133}{73180}Roach coach!
{73842}{73884}I'm not doing that. I'm not doing it.
{73888}{73948}Thrust, thrust.
{73995}{74074}All right, I know you're gonna find|something you like with this group.
{74078}{74135}See, this is just what I gravitate towards.
{74139}{74222}-Really simple.|-And no diamond?. I'm fine with that.
{74314}{74343}Split up?.
{74372}{74413}Come apart.
{75834}{75858}Excuse me.
{75862}{75924}Hi. I'm just here to pick up my rings.
{75928}{75994}-Last name's Murphy.|-Murphy.
{76021}{76070}-Okay, there you go.|-Oh, great. Thank you.
{76074}{76119}Let's take a look.
{76123}{76153}Oh, wow.
{76157}{76205}-They're really beauti--|-Thank you.
{76238}{76311}I'm sorry, does that say "Never to fart"?.
{76316}{76367}That's what you wrote|on your inscription form.
{76371}{76417}I'm sorry, I wrote " Never to part."
{76421}{76466}I don't know who would've|written "fart."
{76470}{76535}-That's ridiculous.|-We get pretty strange requests here...
{76539}{76645}...and we just engrave whatever is written,|and there you go.
{76649}{76716}-Yep. "Never to part."|-"Never to fart."
{76753}{76800}-No, that's a P.|-It's an F, sir.
{76805}{76891}Nope, that's a P. Do you see how|that comes around in a P way?.
{76901}{76927}-Judith?.|-Yes?.
{76931}{76992}Could you come over here|just for a tiny little second?.
{76996}{77030}Thank you. Judith....
{77034}{77089}-Sure.|-What is this letter there?.
{77126}{77175}-That is an F.|-No, that's a P.
{77179}{77226}It's a P.|It comes around like a P.
{77230}{77300}Well, actually, if you look,|there's clearly a gap in the curl.
{77304}{77360}There's no gap in the curl.|Judith?. It connects.
{77364}{77397}That's a P. "Never to part."
{77401}{77470}-Mark, could you just come...|-I don't know that we need Mark.
{77474}{77519}...a little quick second here?.
{77523}{77587}-And what is that?.|-Oh, the novelty inscription, yes.
{77591}{77672}Mark, it's not a novelty inscription.|It's a romantic inscription.
{77676}{77719}Excuse me.|What is this letter?.
{77723}{77839}-It's an F. I do teach penmanship.|-I took his class. It's wonderful.
{77851}{77891}-It's pretty clearly an F.|-Yeah.
{77895}{77919}Excuse me, excuse me.
{77923}{77975}Hi. I'm really sorry|to bother you. Very nice.
{77979}{78092}Could I ask you to help us out with|a problem here, just a little problem?.
{78096}{78145}Could we show the normal person?.|Thank you.
{78149}{78277}What would you call the letter between|the fingers that I'm pointing at right there?.
{78283}{78321}-What is that?.|-An F?.
{78325}{78384}-I'm sorry, sir?. Louder, please?.|-An F?.
{78388}{78411}-F.|-Yes.
{78416}{78492}-That's right.|-Okay, excuse me. Hi. All right.
{78496}{78543}I'm getting married in two days.
{78547}{78614}Thank you.|I really need that to say "Never to part."
{78618}{78682}-That's very nice.|-"Never to part." That's so sweet.
{78686}{78714}And that's what I wrote.
{78718}{78793}I need it to say "Never to part,"|and I need it done immediately.
{78797}{78865}So how do we do that?.|How do we get that done?.
{78869}{78917}We could have it tomorrow.|In the morning.
{78921}{78967}Great.|And that's what we can do.
{78971}{79009}But there's a $250 rush fee.
{79013}{79095}So I'm spending $250 on something|I asked you to do in the first place?.
{79099}{79136}And we can guarantee that.
{79199}{79254}This is ridiculous. There's nothing here.
{79258}{79296}Oh, come on, man.
{79300}{79367}If that old lady from|Murder, she Wrote can do this...
{79371}{79432}...then we can find something.
{79436}{79512}-Are you talking about Angela L--|-Just keep looking.
{79564}{79587}What is that?.
{79592}{79639}Frank Littleton. That's his address.
{79677}{79740}But who's Maria Gonzales?.
{80358}{80394}-Hello?|-Joel, it's Ben.
{80398}{80435}There's no one here by that name.
{80439}{80499}Is there another name|you'd maybe like to try?.
{80503}{80541}Eagle, it's Sapphire.
{80545}{80589}Copy that, Sapphire.|What's your 20?.
{80593}{80629}I'm at John the Baptist's house.
{80640}{80681}-What's he doing?|-He's showering.
{80697}{80745}Dude, you're watching|him take a shower?.
{80749}{80779}No, I'm outside.
{80791}{80825}Then get your butt inside.
{80829}{80917}-What?. Are you nuts?. I'm gonna get caught.|-Listen, the rehearsal's tomorrow.
{80921}{80971}You've only got today to blow the lid off.
{80975}{81004}It's your only chance.
{81008}{81089}Strike first, strike hard. No mercy.
{81273}{81303}What the hell am I doing?.
{81763}{81796}Stop!
{82552}{82587}Maria Gonzales.
{82735}{82760}I got you, sucker M.C.
{82918}{82976}Hi.
{82982}{83038}Wow, look at you...
{83042}{83093}...priest dog.
{83141}{83189}Hi.
{83193}{83222}I'm gonna--
{83226}{83261}No. No, no!
{83443}{83489}That's so gross.
{83681}{83711}Nicodemus!
{83715}{83756}Nicodemus!
{83765}{83813}No, no, no, no!
{83826}{83852}Nicodemus.
{83856}{83904}Leave Mr. Socks alone.
{83908}{83972}Nicodemus! Bad Nicodemus!
{83976}{84045}These are my Cheesy Curls.|No, don't you run away.
{84050}{84130}Bad. These are mine.
{84137}{84205}This is good.|Things are really good.
{84209}{84308}And I'm not even concerned with the fact|that Ben hasn't written his vows yet.
{84313}{84374}-Really?.|-No.
{84378}{84517}He's just drawn this little animated truck|going through a hoop of fire.
{84534}{84572}You know what?.
{84578}{84613}It's actually better.
{84617}{84666}Because he's waiting|until the last second...
{84670}{84777}...when his mind is completely clear|and he can just say what he really means.
{84800}{84860}-Okay, hold on.|-What do we think?. What's the verdict?.
{84864}{84915}Let's just take a second.
{84919}{84965}Honestly?.
{85004}{85065}Looks a little bit like the inside|of a down comforter.
{85128}{85163}What the hell's going on?.
{85168}{85200}But look, no, the rhinest--
{85204}{85276}-It's beautiful, honestly--|-No. I'm not talking about the dress.
{85281}{85346}I'm talking about Ben.|An animated truck?.
{85350}{85422}You know, I wrote seven pages|on how much I love and adore him...
{85426}{85544}...and all he can muster up for me is some|stupid Tonka truck in a three-ring circus?.
{85548}{85609}-That's it?.|-Okay, you know what?.
{85625}{85656}Lay it on me.
{85660}{85712}Oh, God.
{85717}{85774}Please tell me everything's gonna be fine.
{85797}{85837}What do you want me to say?.
{85853}{85908}Sadie, my marriage failed.
{85924}{86012}I watch Titanic by myself, alone,|in my room, every night...
{86016}{86073}...stuffing my face|with Honey BBQ Fritos.
{86093}{86172}Not the one to give you any tips or advice|about your relationship...
{86176}{86232}...no matter how desperate you are.
{86236}{86271}Sorry.
{86289}{86433}However, I do recall my ex|never wrote any vows at all.
{86441}{86484}Really?.
{86505}{86540}That's kind of promising.
{86544}{86567}Yeah.
{86572}{86623}It was probably because he was|too busy...
{86627}{86718}...sleeping with our dental hygienist,|which was great.
{86738}{86800}Hey, but your hygienist is a guy, right?.
{86804}{86841}Yeah.
{86865}{86893}You're fine.
{87231}{87305}Is this a piece of work?.|They don't make them like this any more.
{87315}{87351}When two people say "l do"...
{87355}{87424}...they're putting their lives|in each other's hands entirely.
{87428}{87487}Anything less than that|is doomed to failure.
{87491}{87542}Now, the last test you have to pass...
{87546}{87602}...before I certify you|ready for marriage...
{87606}{87657}...is the communication test.
{87676}{87715}Which is very important...
{87719}{87798}...given how poorly we've been doing|in that area lately.
{87802}{87828}Oh, me?. Don't worry.
{87833}{87873}I plan on communicating very well--
{87877}{87955}Okay, Ben, can you please|just let him finish talking?.
{87959}{87997}-Thank you.|-Yep.
{88053}{88109}-Sorry, reverend.|-It's okay.
{88113}{88200}To demonstrate how important|communication is in that area:
{88242}{88283}-What?.|-Blindfold.
{88309}{88363}-What are you doing?.|-I'm not doing anything.
{88367}{88427}You're gonna be Sadie's eyes|as she drives us.
{88432}{88515}-You're insane!|-lf you wanna pass this course...
{88519}{88581}...and get married tomorrow,|you have to pass this test.
{88585}{88613}Your call.
{88617}{88717}-Yeah. Yeah. I can do this.|-You're actually gonna go through with this?.
{88734}{88827}-What, Ben, you don't think I can do this?.|-Okay. Maybe you don't understand...
{88831}{88858}...what's going on here.
{88862}{88916}Ben, there's two sets of controls.
{88921}{88969}I can take over at any time.
{89017}{89053}What'll it be, Benjamin?.
{89057}{89086}Yeah.
{89105}{89158}Well, I'm gonna need|a little help here, though.
{89162}{89200}First you need to put it in gear.
{89204}{89249}-Check.|-And then you're gonna ease out...
{89253}{89283}...onto the street.
{89378}{89430}Left. Left!
{89434}{89497}There you are. Right.|To the right!
{89501}{89555}Ben, did you see a clipboard back there?.
{89559}{89607}There it is. Least it's warm.
{89611}{89655}-What--?.|-It's a communication exercise.
{89659}{89706}You will be graded.|Less than 80 percent...
{89710}{89754}...consider getting married in Vegas.
{89758}{89812}You know what?.|Vegas sounds awesome right now.
{89816}{89874}Maybe you can get an|Elvis impersonator to officiate.
{89878}{89911}"Hey, my wife. Yeah."
{90024}{90099}-Ben, you wanna help your future bride?.|-Yep, yep, yeah. I do, I do.
{90103}{90159}How about we take a right?.|Head back to the church.
{90163}{90203}You might wanna brake.|Anytime.
{90255}{90310}Sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I got nervous.
{90314}{90380}That's very good.|Taking responsibility. Excellent, Sadie.
{90384}{90419}More enthusiasm|in the back, Ben.
{90423}{90503}Oh, my God, I'm having so much fun!|Aren't you?. I might pee my pants.
{90507}{90555}Sarcasm, wicked stepsister|of communication.
{90559}{90597}-Point off.|-Now take a right. Now.
{90601}{90637}-A right?. Now?.|-Now!
{90692}{90716}It's a one-way street!
{90721}{90761}Okay, well, then should I pull over?.
{90765}{90822}No, no. Just go straight.|They'll go around you.
{90826}{90904}Oh, my-- Jesus. Okay, okay.
{90909}{91024}-ln about 20 yards we're gonna turn.|-20 yards means nothing to me. I can't see.
{91029}{91087}Here we go. Turning now!
{91113}{91194}There's a man.|That's an old man in a hat and a thing.
{91198}{91235}Look out!
{91304}{91368}-I'm blind, Ben!|-That's enough. We're ending this. Stop!
{91372}{91423}Is that what you do|when things get difficult?.
{91427}{91462}You're just gonna quit?.
{91466}{91501}I need to count on you, Ben.
{91505}{91586}Life will hand you stress|and the key to managing your anxiety...
{91590}{91670}-...is not letting it contaminate your partner.|-Garbage truck!
{91694}{91722}-Where?.|-Punch it!
{91789}{91822}Yeah!
{91862}{91920}I'm pretty sure I'm not learning|anything from this.
{91924}{91978}-Are we good?. Are we good?.|-There's Burt Fleeger!
{91982}{92018}Looking good, Hollywood!
{92022}{92117}-I feel like I'm not getting any guidance.|-You might wanna pick up speed a little.
{92121}{92202}-Wait, wait. Why would we do that?.|-There's a parking space up there.
{92206}{92249}Gun it, Sadie.
{92366}{92411}-I never get this space!|-Oh, my God!
{92415}{92458}Perfect.
{92503}{92546}Hello, Jones family. How's it going?.
{92550}{92587}Hello, reverend.
{92597}{92637}Daughter's a good little driver.
{92718}{92811}Well, you have the wedding processional.|You can go with Mendelssohn...
{92815}{92903}...or one couple actually had Captain and|Tennille here playing "Muskrat Love."
{92907}{92971}It's your call.|After you boogie down the aisle...
{92975}{93030}...I'll start by saying something nice.
{93034}{93107}Speaking of that, let's give a big|Saint Augustine welcome...
{93111}{93199}...to Ben Murphy's parents,|Ron and Mary Murphy.
{93206}{93241}Came all the way from Seattle.
{93245}{93344}Then I get into a brief message about|the joy and the sanctity of marriage...
{93349}{93415}...and that on your honeymoon,|try and act surprised.
{93419}{93461}It's an old joke, but sometimes works.
{93465}{93509}Then we got prayer, hymn, prayer, hymn.
{93513}{93580}And then we get into the vows.
{93585}{93652}In my course, the couple|writes their own vows.
{93657}{93700}And that in mind, may I have your vows?.
{93714}{93763}Thank you.
{93781}{93824}Thank you.
{93867}{93898}-Ben?.|-Yeah.
{93902}{93929}Got the vows?.
{93933}{93979}Ben, where are your vows?.
{93988}{94016}Oh, I have them. I just--
{94020}{94091}I haven't finished them, but I will|have them here tomorrow.
{94117}{94191}Okey-dokey.|Well, I guess that'll have to do for now.
{94195}{94251}After the vows,|we have the lighting of the candle.
{94255}{94323}-It's true, by the way.|-Not now, Ben. I just wanna think.
{94328}{94355}Thinking's good.
{94359}{94414}-Yes, I wanna think about everything.|-What about?.
{94418}{94468}I'm guessing these aren't|part of the vows.
{94473}{94603}Okay, because I used to think that we were|so perfectly compatible for each other...
{94607}{94651}...and now....
{94665}{94692}-Look at us, Ben.|-What?.
{94697}{94783}-Ben, you want two kids, and I want four.|-So what?.
{94787}{94864}You obviously think my family|is a bunch of rich, alcoholic snobs.
{94868}{94950}-You never take the lead on things, Ben!|-And I'm not good enough for you!
{94955}{95015}I'm not adventurous enough in bed, right?.
{95019}{95079}And I'm not as handsome as Carlisle,|not as successful.
{95084}{95133}Carlisle has nothing to do with it.
{95137}{95197}-Carlisle has everything to do with it.|-How?.
{95201}{95286}Because he is someone whose opinion|you trust way more than mine.
{95290}{95371}Oh, God. When have l|ever said that to you, Ben?.
{95375}{95401}You just don't have to.
{95407}{95449}"Carlisle, what crystal should we use?.
{95453}{95533}What brand of cheese is good, Carlisle?. "
{95537}{95605}God, I am so sick of you|choosing Carlisle's cheese.
{95609}{95724}-Carlisle's cheese. Explore that, Ben.|-Enough of the pop psychology, reverend.
{95728}{95834}Because all you've done is everything|you can to make sure this doesn't work.
{95838}{95933}I've worked very hard to create lines|of communication between you and Sadie...
{95937}{95990}...to let you know what you're in for.
{95994}{96029}-You're onto it.|-Yeah, we are.
{96033}{96092}We are discovering|a whole shitload right now!
{96096}{96135}-Really?.|-Yes, we are, Ben.
{96140}{96212}-Guys, seriously, space, please.|-Now's the time. Pop the info.
{96217}{96269}Okay. Okay. You know what?.
{96273}{96333}I didn't wanna have to do this,|but I have no choice.
{96337}{96410}So aside from the fact that|Reverend Frank bugged our apartment--
{96414}{96440}Excuse me, what?.
{96444}{96491}I've mounted an investigation.
{96495}{96557}One that I think you would be|interested to hear about.
{96561}{96648}So Frankie, should I tell them|or should you?.
{96681}{96720}What do you want me to tell them?.
{96725}{96795}What I want you to tell them|is what their good and decent...
{96799}{96903}...and ever-so-intuitive reverend|was doing when he married...
{96907}{96989}...and then subsequently divorced|one Maria Gonzales.
{97017}{97049}That's not true.
{97053}{97143}Reverend Frank has never been|married or divorced.
{97163}{97216}That's what I thought too,|Grandma Jones.
{97220}{97246}But...
{97250}{97274}...Reverend Frank?.
{97334}{97366}It's true.
{97370}{97394}What?.
{97398}{97424}Oh, it's very true.
{97428}{97498}How can we trust anything|he said to us now?.
{97502}{97579}We have put our relationship|in the hands of a total hypocrite.
{97626}{97722}I didn't wanna have to talk about this|to protect certain parties...
{97726}{97797}...but enough time has passed|so the truth can finally be known.
{97801}{97832}Yes. Please do.
{97836}{97921}Several years ago, a young woman named|Maria Gonzales attended our church.
{97940}{98018}She was a refugee who was|denied political asylum.
{98022}{98132}If she was deported back to Guatemala,|she would have faced most certain death.
{98137}{98207}So in order for her and her children|to stay in this country...
{98211}{98287}...I agreed to marry her|so she could get a green card.
{98295}{98365}Once she was legal, we divorced.
{98369}{98429}She moved to New Mexico with her kids.
{98433}{98507}A couple of years ago I got a letter|from her, and she told me...
{98511}{98594}...that her oldest|had been accepted to Harvard Law.
{98605}{98701}He was going to graduate|in the top of his class, and when he did...
{98705}{98759}...he was going to go|into immigration reform.
{98763}{98834}And that is the story of Maria Gonzales.
{98869}{98913}I keep their pictures in my wallet...
{98986}{99059}...to remind me that one person|can make a difference...
{99063}{99106}...even against insurmountable odds.
{99145}{99186}That's--|That's Pablo right there.
{99190}{99216}Ben.
{99265}{99383}If you had just spent half the amount|of time on your wedding vows...
{99387}{99468}...as this stupid little investigation...
{99478}{99549}...we would probably be walking|down the aisle tomorrow.
{99553}{99595}And, no, no....
{99617}{99661}I can't do it.
{99809}{99889}-Unbelievable.|-You're such a jerk.
{99944}{99971}Benjamin.
{100013}{100053}Are you happy now?.
{100076}{100128}It's a painful process.
{100133}{100164}That's why we do it.
{100168}{100210}To find the truth, Benjamin.
{100228}{100252}Sometim--
{100313}{100393}Why did you punch the reverend?.|What is wrong with you?.
{100424}{100495}Nice right hook, but you are going to hell.|Know that?.
{100499}{100548}I'm sorry. J.C., I'm sorry.
{100614}{100689}Three weeks.|That's a new course record.
{100693}{100781}Man, I haven't seen a right hook like that|since the Buffolini meltdown.
{100785}{100840}I hate this part.
{100848}{100902}I'll get the bag of frozen peas.|Come on.
{100912}{100947}Here we go.
{101509}{101543}Hi.
{101577}{101642}I can't believe I was about to marry|someone I didn't know.
{101646}{101697}That's why we have the course.
{101701}{101765}It's good that I found out now|instead of down the road...
{101769}{101827}...because that just|would have been awful.
{101845}{101904}I'm sorry, he just, he makes me so mad.
{101920}{101968}What am I supposed to do now?.
{101991}{102044}-You still have your honeymoon tickets?.|-Yeah.
{102048}{102074}Use them.
{102078}{102164}Go away for a couple of days.|Take a friend, family, anybody.
{102186}{102248}-I don't know.|-Oh, come on, it'll be great for you.
{102263}{102336}Get a tan, huh?. Trust me.
{102421}{102464}See you, kiddo.
{102497}{102538}You know...
{102550}{102616}...maybe Ben wasn't the only....
{102621}{102645}No.
{102649}{102726}-No, no. What?. What?.|-No, have a great trip.
{102893}{102952}I mean, it wasn't supposed|to be like this.
{102956}{103011}Yeah, I feel as bad as you do.
{103029}{103106}Now she's using her honeymoon|ticket without me.
{103113}{103166}I mean, how is that supposed|to make me feel?.
{103188}{103256}Bad. I think.
{103293}{103416}Three weeks ago, I was the happiest guy|in the world, and now I just....
{103448}{103487}Now I'm just sitting here with you.
{103516}{103592}Thanks.|Thanks, Ben. Appreciate that.
{103597}{103650}No, you know what I mean, I just--
{103654}{103689}Hey, it's cool.
{103693}{103813}Look, don't take this the wrong way,|because Sadie's cool, I like her a lot...
{103817}{103869}...but there are plenty of fish in the sea.
{103873}{103937}And now it's your time to be|the king barracuda...
{103941}{104008}...and get out there|and swim with the sweet tuna.
{104012}{104052}The ocean is yours, man.
{104111}{104169}That's the stupidest thing|I've ever heard.
{104209}{104247}Okay.
{104269}{104306}You're a bear.
{104310}{104340}Now jump in that forest...
{104345}{104420}...and you gotta tag as many|cute, furry, bear butts as you can.
{104425}{104452}Joel...
{104457}{104511}...you're my best friend, man.|You know that?.
{104525}{104594}-And I love you. You know that?.|-I love you too.
{104598}{104698}But you have got to be|the worst advice-giver I know.
{104725}{104798}I mean, not only is your|advice terrible, but...
{104802}{104875}...it just backfires at every turn.
{104879}{104964}And now you're talking to me|about fish and bears.
{104968}{105056}She's a woman, Joel.|I mean, she's an amazing woman.
{105061}{105116}And she's just so beautiful.
{105120}{105209}And she's loving and....
{105215}{105280}It was all right there...
{105306}{105351}...and I lost it.
{105397}{105498}And I don't need you telling me|that I should go out and find someone else.
{105502}{105593}I mean, I don't need anybody|telling me how to go--
{105624}{105678}I don't need anyone telling me.
{105705}{105745}Wait. Where you--|Ben! Hey!
{105894}{105946}No way.
{106049}{106113}Whoa! Is that one strike|or two against Rodriguez?.
{106117}{106142}Two.
{106146}{106201}Awesome job with the camouflage, guys.
{106205}{106234}Seriously, you got me.
{106238}{106314}Who'd have thought you'd be in a van|with "Saint Augustine's"?.
{106320}{106355}Just listening to the ball game!
{106381}{106425}Cubs are off today.
{106811}{106838}Hey, Gillie.
{106842}{106912}This guy say he's in love.|He come to Jamaica to find his girl.
{106916}{106999}Well, see, we were supposed to get married|and then she just called it off.
{107033}{107092}Oh, no. It's a long story. Just....
{107096}{107147}Man, you don't have to worry,|it's a long ride.
{107151}{107226}It's really a long ride.|You can sit and tell us.
{107230}{107266}Well, what happened was....
{107318}{107405}It is absolutely beautiful here.
{107428}{107492}Hey, Mom, you gonna get in your bikini?.
{107497}{107520}Like hell I will.
{107721}{107788}Talk to her. This is for lovers, man!
{107796}{107822}Thank you.
{108194}{108227}It's Ben.
{108354}{108390}-What?.|-Sadie, it's me.
{108394}{108461}-I know. What do you want?.|-Look, I have to talk to you.
{108465}{108502}Guess what, Ben?.
{108506}{108600}You had your chance. You had an empty|book and you didn't say anything.
{108604}{108675}-And that's part of the thing. Listen--|-No. Ben...
{108679}{108751}-...I don't wanna talk to you.|-You don't understand. I'm in--
{108755}{108793}Sadie?.
{108805}{108876}How come I could say so much|and he couldn't say anything to me?.
{108881}{108930}Can someone please explain that?.
{109064}{109096}Sorry.
{109101}{109146}I was just clearing my throat.
{109150}{109191}-John!|-What?.
{109195}{109249}A piece of coconut went down|the wrong way.
{109253}{109292}Your daughter's in pain.
{109297}{109364}-Yes, I'm in pain. And I'm all alone too.|-Not you.
{109368}{109415}-I'm alone.|-Not you.
{109420}{109500}Is anyone at all concerned|with the fact that my life is falling apart?.
{109505}{109568}Oh, of course we are, sweetie.
{109572}{109636}But relationships are complicated.
{109640}{109744}-We certainly don't have all the answers.|-You guys have been married for 30 years.
{109748}{109847}-You must be doing something right.|-Not all those years were great.
{109851}{109960}Years 1 6 through 1 8 in our marriage were|something straight out of The shining.
{109983}{110068}Okay, but Ben and I couldn't even decide on|what color napkins we wanted...
{110072}{110113}...Iet alone how many kids.
{110117}{110183}And he couldn't handle that|I have a good guy friend.
{110187}{110265}I don't know if it's our friendship|he was insecure about.
{110269}{110312}Really?.
{110326}{110372}Listen, I'm gonna support you here.
{110376}{110452}But you gotta think about this|from Ben's perspective.
{110456}{110523}How do you think he feels when you're|always coming to me?.
{110527}{110594}-I don't go to you all the time.|-When are you going to him?.
{110621}{110689}Just maybe...
{110693}{110761}...Ben wants to be with somebody|who needs him for a change.
{110798}{110836}That's really heartfelt.
{111277}{111330}-Does this happen all the time?.|-Sadie?.
{111334}{111401}To go from being so in love to this.
{111405}{111466}You know, I'm all alone|on my honeymoon at Sandals...
{111470}{111563}...couples in love all over the place.|This isn 't what I pictured.
{111567}{111625}Well, is it ever what you picture?.
{111645}{111711}Were we the first ones to fail the course?.
{111715}{111802}Who said the course is over?.|It's only over when you decide it's done.
{111807}{111858}I don't know what to do.
{111872}{111905}It'll come to you.
{111909}{111946}Have faith.
{111985}{112041}Thank you, Reverend Frank.
{112090}{112118}Right on schedule.
{112122}{112198}Hallelujah. Now do you mind?.|I need my beauty sleep.
{112202}{112313}No smoking on this flight, but you|can light up whatever once we land.
{113453}{113496}-Ben?.|-Hey.
{113501}{113548}You picked up.
{113552}{113623}It's so weird.|I was just thinking about you.
{113628}{113665}You were?
{113669}{113708}Yeah.
{113726}{113824}My family said some things|to me yesterday about...
{113829}{113910}...me not relying on you and...
{113945}{114005}...it got me thinking...
{114009}{114059}...about that stupid truck...
{114063}{114111}...you drew in your wedding|vow notebook.
{114115}{114199}And I know this is gonna|sound so weird but...
{114290}{114351}...it's why I love you.
{114365}{114466}You don't always say the right things|or do the right things but somehow...
{114489}{114588}...I know you would jump through|a hoop of fire for me.
{114613}{114669}Hey, can you do me a favor?
{114695}{114795}I think you should come to your window.
{115274}{115336}I left my vow book at home so...
{115340}{115392}...I figured I should write|a few of them here.
{115453}{115480}What do you think?.
{115708}{115757}-I am so sorry. I messed up.|-Me too.
{115761}{115813}There's so much to say.|I just didn't know how.
{115817}{115885}I need to stop doing everything myself|and share the reins.
{115889}{115947}No matter what I do,|I know you're gonna support me.
{115951}{116010}If I'm ever blindfolded,|you're the one to guide me.
{116014}{116071}I want to have as many kids|as we possibly can.
{116075}{116123}Really?.|After Macy's, I definitely want two.
{116128}{116164}I need to be more decisive.
{116169}{116227}-About napkins, about--|-Napkins, cheese, anything...
{116231}{116294}...at the end of the day,|I'm gonna rely on you.
{116298}{116372}Because nothing means|more to me than you.
{116377}{116446}Nothing. I love you.
{116450}{116495}I love you.
{116680}{116738}What's going on here?.
{116760}{116852}Reverend Frank?.|What are you doing here?.
{116867}{116926}Reverend Frank is|everywhere, remember?.
{116930}{116977}Thought you two broke up.
{116981}{117062}We did. We just sort of talked it through.
{117066}{117142}Seems like we have more faith|in each other than we thought.
{117153}{117177}Congratulations.
{117181}{117232}You just passed the course|with flying colors.
{117263}{117298}So how about it?.
{117302}{117355}Do you think we should|get this wedding started?.
{117396}{117423}I do.
{117445}{117509}And do you,|Benjamin Fitzpatrick Murphy...
{117513}{117636}...take Sadie Wilhelmina Jones|to be your lawfully wedded wife?.
{117640}{117716}-I do.|-The rings.
{117809}{117859}"Never to fart"?.
{117863}{117890}Oh, my God.
{117894}{117956}I didn't change it.|I'm gonna change it when I get back.
{117960}{117985}-I promise I will.|-No.
{117989}{118087}Bite your tongue, because I wouldn't want|it changed for anything in the whole world.
{118091}{118129}No.
{118311}{118347}Ready?.
{118395}{118465}By the power vested in me by God...
{118469}{118590}...and the Minister of National Security|and Justice of Ocho Rios, Jamaica...
{118594}{118690}...I now pronounce you|husband and wife.
{119653}{119714}You gotta turn. There it is!
{120044}{120108}Frank, we just wanted to come|and thank you for everything.
{120113}{120173}-I'm just fulfilling my life's calling.|-You know what?.
{120177}{120254}-We wouldn't have gotten here without you.|-Thanks.
{120258}{120319}You're gonna have a wonderful life.|I have no doubts.
{120323}{120413}Excuse me, may I borrow my daughter--|Your wife, for a dance?.
{120417}{120458}-Yes, please.|-Thank you.
{120462}{120520}-Bye.|-You look beautiful.
{120524}{120560}Hey, can I ask you a question?.
{120565}{120590}Sure.
{120594}{120655}When did you know that we were|ready to get married?.
{120659}{120769}The moment you told Joel that Sadie wasn't|a fish, I knew it was meant to be.
{120773}{120849}Besides, anybody who kicks|a reverend's ass for his woman...
{120853}{120887}...you're A-okay in my book.
{120891}{120916}Well....
{120935}{121006}You're starting an incredible journey|with a wonderful partner.
{121010}{121038}Thank you.
{121042}{121126}And on the honeymoon, act surprised.
{121130}{121162}I will.
{121166}{121235}-Take care of yourself, B.|-You too, Frank.
{121470}{121518}Oh, my God.
{121635}{121700}-Wait.|-No, that's what they're supposed to do.
{121704}{121794}I know. I lost-- We broke--
{121798}{121841}But it's okay if we laugh, right?.
{121845}{121883}It's not okay if we laugh, is it?.
{121964}{122014}-You broke!|-I did not.
{122029}{122079}We still got a siren. My ride's here.
{122083}{122162}I like shooting downtown L.A.,|because pretty much you got 91 1 all day.
{122166}{122190}I'll be over here.
{122285}{122381}Whoa!|"Be chill, don't kill."
{122385}{122457}That goes for you too, Mr. Simpson.|Okay.
{122535}{122573}I thought you'd work so hard!
{122605}{122683}Just get me a bottle of water|and a rubber mallet.
{122821}{122915}Come on.|Thrust it, thrust it, thrust it!
{122960}{123042}People, we can do this.|They're not that....
{123046}{123088}Ben?.
{123178}{123285}Help out, everybody.|Motherf* * *er.
{123297}{123351}You play cutch?.
{123355}{123379}"Cutch."
{123383}{123466}Let me walk back and cutch,|which is a old game.
{123470}{123522}That's scary that I could|say it like that....
{123534}{123575}Oh, my God.
{123599}{123644}No. Stop.
{123721}{123791}I'm gonna look like such a rookie,|because every time....
{123811}{123851}Cut.
{123957}{123990}-Yeah!|-Yeah!
