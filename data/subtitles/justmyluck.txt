1
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,440
- Morning, Oscar.
- Morning, Miss Albright.

2
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,440
Finding a cab may take a while
in this mess. No umbrella?

3
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,040
Really think I need one?

4
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,120
Guess not.

5
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,200
Thanks. Have a good one.

6
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,120
Oh.

7
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,960
Nice. Bye.

8
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,120
First stop,
66th and Broadway.

9
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,480
I need to be there
in four minutes, please.

10
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,800
Oh, yeah.
That's gonna happen.

11
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,880
Hi. Dana?

12
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,400
WNYH. You're caller seven.
Can you name our mystery song?

13
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,400
Oops. I did it again. Sorry.

14
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,400
That's right! You win!

15
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,480
<i>Oh, that's like
five greens in a row.</i>

16
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,840
The force is strong
this morning, boy.

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Dana, it looks like
I'm running a little early.

18
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,160
So I'm gonna make a stop
at Balducci's. Muffin?

19
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,320
I am the master of my universe.
Positive energy, positive results.

20
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, perfect.
Taking the dog for a walk.

21
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,200
Good morning, Mr. Phillips. I want to introduce
you to the hottest band in New York City.

22
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,440
Magic time.

23
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,960
Oh, perfect!

24
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,440
Huh. Find a penny-

25
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,360
Uh, Mr. Phillips?
Excuse me?

26
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,720
<i>Here we go. Lift.</i>

27
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,480
Good.
Walk it around.

28
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,480
Bring it around.
Bring it around.

29
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,880
<i>That's it.</i>

30
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
<i>- Hey, hold it, please.
- Oh.</i>

31
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,160
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

32
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,680
Come on, baby.

33
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,520
Baby made a poo-poo!

34
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Now, let's go.

35
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,440
Baby, your poo-poo's
costing me.

36
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Happy?

37
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,960
- Hi. Good morning.
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,680
Sweet.

39
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,680
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

40
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,080
- What are you doing? Get off!
- I'm sorry. Are you o-

41
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,320
Look, I'm- Let me help you up.
Stop hitting me!

42
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,440
- Let me help you up! It was an accident!
- Oh, my God! Help!

43
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
- Hey, you! Don't move!
- This is not-

44
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,000
- Help! Help!
- This is not- not good. Not good.

45
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,600
<i>- Somebody!
- Stay there!</i>

46
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>- Let me help you up! Come on!
- Get that thing near me, and I'll smack it!</i>

47
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,600
<i>I need backup! 288 in the park!
Hey, you! Stay there!</i>

48
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,520
<i>- I'll get you!
- The button popped!</i>

49
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,600
<i> Green jacket, skull cap.
Pursuing on foot.</i>

50
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,120
We're making music here.
We're not making chicken.

51
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,120
Well, get it done.
We need this done.

52
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,120
<i>Sir, excuse me!
Good morning, Mr. Phillips!</i>

53
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,360
- I have a brand-new-
- Got you!

54
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,720
<i>- Mr. Phillips!
- Give me your arm, pervert!</i>

55
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,040
<i>- Take a quick listen!
- You smell like dog crap!</i>

56
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,800
Officer, could you take me
to the 36th Precinct?

57
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
They're nice to me there.

58
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,480
You promise? 6:00?

59
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,480
Okay. I'll be the redhead
who looks like this.

60
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,240
In that case,
I'll be there at 5:30.

61
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,240
Okay.

62
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,560
Morning, Maggie.

63
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,720
Oh, what are you
so chipper about?

64
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,320
Brad Pitt and Jude Law
had a baby...

65
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,320
and I just met him in the elevator.

66
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,320
<i>Braden & Company.
Can I help you?</i>

67
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,840
Somebody ordered Balducci's.

68
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Oh, yum. Excuse me.

69
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,480
What's happening on this body?
Is this a new coat?

70
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah. Can you believe it?
Sample sale. Fifty percent off.

71
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,760
- Ohh.
- And her coat met someone.

72
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,440
David Pennington. Owner of
the Boston Celtics David Pennington?

73
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,680
No, silly. It's his son.

74
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,680
Impressive. But I, too,
had a really great morning.

75
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,440
Apparently, Saturn
is in line with Neptune.

76
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,360
Dana, you know those things
aren't exactly factual, right?

77
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Ooh! Ooh! And my new song
got a really polite rejection letter...

78
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,520
from Two Tone Records.

79
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,040
But you know what they say:
One door closes, and two doors open.

80
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,120
<i>Speaking of doors, uh,
the Phillips meeting- When is it?</i>

81
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Now.

82
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,880
All right, I've gotta
go take notes.

83
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,120
- Okay.
- I will see you guys after.

84
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,040
- Bye. Can I have one of those?
- Do you want the bran?

85
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,200
Where is everybody?

86
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,320
Look, our SoundScans
last week were 470,000.

87
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
That's why we de-Yes, we deserve
to be at the front of the store.

88
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,240
Look, you tell him
because I said so.

89
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,320
You tell him Damon Phillips said so.
I'm hanging up now.

90
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,640
I thought we had a meeting.

91
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,840
Oh, they should be here soon.
If you'd care to-

92
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,320
Wait? This is a big insult.
D. Doesn't wait for anybody.

93
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,480
<i>Yeah, that's right.
No one. Okay?</i>

94
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,320
And he is furious.
Ain't that right?

95
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,400
It's true. I'm furious.

96
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,520
They should be here
at any second. I promise.

97
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,160
- Are you kidding me, people!
Sara! Sara, do something!

98
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Oh, look! I just got
an I.M. From Miss Braden.

99
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,520
And it says she's doing
some final touches...

100
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,360
on an extra special presentation
for you, and she'll be right here.

101
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,040
Right.

102
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,040
Do you know how much Downtown
Masquerade Records made last year?

103
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,880
Yes. 507 million, gross.

104
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,880
Therefore, you know how much each
and every minute of my time is worth.

105
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,880
$964.

106
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,360
Damn, that's a lot of money.
I didn't expect that.

107
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,720
<i> Yeah, and that includes
the time that you're sleeping.</i>

108
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,720
So even when I go poo-poo,
I'm makin' money?

109
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,720
<i>- That's some expensive shit.
- Damn skippy.</i>

110
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,560
<i>So you see why I can't afford
to waste any time.</i>

111
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,760
And this is wasted time!

112
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,080
I completely understand that. If you could
just give me a moment, then I will start.

113
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,400
Please. If it's not worth the minute,
then I will give you $965.

114
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,240
Hmm.

115
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,200
Because personally
I think you're underpaid.

116
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,400
Hope you have
your checkbook.

117
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,600
- They brought him into custody.
- Charlie caught the case?

118
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,120
- Yeah.
- Charlie's crazy, you know.

119
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,800
- Oh, I can't believe it's raining again.
- Oh. Yeah.

120
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Let me out! Let me out first!

121
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,200
- Sara!
- Yes, uh, Miss-

122
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,440
Right. No. Of course.

123
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,800
Wha- Right.

124
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,880
Damon. Damon, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,240
Uh-huh.

126
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,440
With cheese. Okay.

127
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,120
I just need to get the files,
and we can start the presentation-

128
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,280
- No, no. We're done.
- Damon, please. The elevator was stuck.

129
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,880
What are you talking about? Miss Albright
just pitched me your entire P.R. Strategy.

130
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,480
It's brilliant. Especially
the part about the party.

131
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,600
Oh. A p-party?

132
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,680
Yeah, the masquerade
bash thing. I love it.

133
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,800
<i>- Oh, you-you like that?
- Yeah.</i>

134
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,720
It's a great way to showcase our talent and
get a tax write-off and support a good cause.

135
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,280
And you know I can never
say no... to a party.

136
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,080
<i> What you say.
What you say. What you say.</i>

137
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,000
<i>Me too.
I love to par-tay.</i>

138
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,480
Don't do that.

139
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,640
<i>Got you covered, Mr. D.
Your car is right this way.</i>

140
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,320
Masquerade bash?

141
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,080
Uh, I'm really sorry,
Miss Braden. I just-

142
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,680
I took notes at other meetings,
and then I just improvised from there.

143
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,760
Well, looks like you've
got a big party to plan.

144
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,440
Right. Right. Yeah.

145
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,440
<i>Of course, you'll need
your own office.</i>

146
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,360
- Wh- Me?
- Your idea. You're in charge. Sara?

147
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,040
<i>- Huh?
- Find Ashley a new office...</i>

148
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,520
- and get her a company credit card.
- Thank you, Miss Braden.

149
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Oh, please, Ashley.
From now on, it's Peggy.

150
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,880
- Peggy.
- Peggy.

151
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,040
And you are?

152
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,360
- Mail.
- Whatever.

153
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,560
And don't worry, Ashley.
I'll be watching your every move.

154
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,560
<i>- Sara.
- Yes, ma'am?</i>

155
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,960
Katy, I'm home.

156
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,160
Oh, hey, Jake.

157
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,160
Hey. Wow.
What happened to you?

158
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,160
- Fourth-grade boys.
- They're the worst, aren't they? Let me see.

159
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,640
- What's it stuck on with?
- Krazy Glue.

160
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,920
Huh, been there. At least
you had a better day than me.

161
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,680
- Burger?
- Of course. Ketchup for you.

162
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
- Katy, where's my bun?
- Oh, it's in the oven, Grandma.

163
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,840
<i>- She's got a bun in the oven?
- Hey, Jake.</i>

164
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,920
- Hey, Aunt Martha.
- Now, Katy...

165
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,520
I'll be back after
my shift at midnight.

166
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,520
Cool.

167
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,520
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

168
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,920
- Love you, Jake.
- Love you too.

169
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,600
<i>- Katy, mind your cousin.
- I'll keep an eye on her.</i>

170
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,080
<i>- See ya.
- Ready?</i>

171
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,760
Wait. Is it gonna sting?
'Cause I kind of like wearing it.

172
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,960
Well, it's not gonna sting
if you hold still.

173
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,600
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Hold still! It's gonna be fine!

174
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,120
Hold still.
One, two, three-

175
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,440
There you go. There you go.
Well, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. All right.

176
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,200
- What do you say?
- Thank you, Jake. You're my hero.

177
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,280
Give me some skin.
You know, I'm gonna take this.

178
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,880
This is definitely
a, uh, choking hazard.

179
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,040
- All right.
- Bye.

180
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,120
See ya.

181
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,800
<i>Not again! Oh!</i>

182
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,800
So, where is he taking you?

183
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,240
A basketball game.
His dad's team is playing Philly.

184
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,800
Not sexy enough.
Home or away?

185
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,800
- Away.
- Let me guess.

186
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
On his private jet
which he flies himself?

187
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,840
- So wrong. He has a pilot.
- Speaking of dates. Hello?

188
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,840
<i>We should try to find
the dragon lady one for the bash.</i>

189
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,640
That way, she won't be all over us,
watching our every move.

190
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,000
Mm. Good luck. Men of Peggy's caliber
don't exactly take ads in the Yellow Pages.

191
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,680
Could you possibly
idolize her any more?

192
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,520
<i>What? She's sophisticated, glamorous,
gets invited everywhere...</i>

193
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,000
and never has to stay home
because she has nothing to wear.

194
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,000
- Right. Nothing to wear.
- Wee, wee, wee.

195
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,280
- Coming!
- I'll get it.

196
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,760
- I'm coming.
- I'm coming!

197
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
- Find an outfit.
- I found one.

198
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,360
<i>- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Whoa. Who is that?</i>

199
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,360
Down, girl. You're drooling on my doormat.
Oh, it's my next-door neighbor.

200
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
- Who?
- Shh. Antonio.

201
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,840
<i>- Oh, hey, Ashley.
- Hey.</i>

202
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Your dry cleaning was delivered
while you were out, so I took it.

203
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,040
Oh, you are such an angel.
Thank you.

204
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,800
- I do what I can. Big date tonight?
- Kind of big. You?

205
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,720
Ah, every night is date night.

206
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,720
- Okay, I'll see you then.
- Thanks.

207
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
- Bye.
- Oh, hey, Antonio.

208
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Are you free next Thursday?

209
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,400
I'm never free.
What do you have in mind?

210
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,560
Well, you won't want to miss this.

211
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,720
<i>Masquerade Records is throwing
an outrageous promo party.</i>

212
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,640
Food, fun, dancing...
and a blind date with my boss.

213
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,880
Your boss?
What's she like?

214
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,240
She's very smart, strong,
an independent woman.

215
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,240
- Is she good-looking?
- Of course.

216
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,720
Okay, look, if you think we'll hit it off,
then that's good enough for me.

217
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,080
Oh, you're the best.
Thank you so much. Bye.

218
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,920
- Bye.
- Oh, yes! A date for the dragon lady.

219
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,240
- Yes!
- You know, this isn't mine.

220
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,240
Whose is it?

221
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,840
Oh! Sarah Jessica Parker's.

222
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,600
- What?
- Not kidding.

223
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,240
I did not know Sarah Jessica Parker
lived in your building.

224
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Oh, my God.
And look, it's Dolce.

225
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,080
Oh, my gosh.
I can return it tomorrow.

226
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Let me look. Oh, yes.

227
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
Your size.
What are the odds?

228
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,200
- Don't be jealous.
- You know, this might actually look cute on me.

229
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,360
- You should totally wear it tonight.
- Well, of course.

230
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,920
- Yeah, I'm gonna need some chocolate now.
- I'm gonna need some milk.

231
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,280
I'm gonna go try on the dress.

232
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,520
I'm gonna go try on the dress.

233
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,880
Thanks.

234
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,800
Ay, ay! Asshole!

235
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,360
<i>- Hey, watch it, will ya!</i>

236
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,120
Sorry. Sorry. It's okay.

237
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,480
Yo, one, two, check.
Sound check.

238
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,640
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey, Mac.

239
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,520
Hey, hey! Hey, Jake!

240
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,360
Jake, how'd it go?

241
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,000
So, uh- So you got
Phillips the CD?

242
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,600
Uh, not ex- not exactly.

243
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,760
You know, we just had some
scheduling conflicts we had to deal with.

244
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,680
Jake, this has been
going on for weeks.

245
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,680
Guys, we're right on track.
Trust me.

246
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,680
There are even gonna be a couple
of "A" and "R" guys here tonight.

247
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,880
Hey, Jake. There's a clogged toilet
in the men's room.

248
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,680
Uh, and I'm looking forward
to plunging it, Mac...

249
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,200
but not until my shift starts,
which is in two hours.

250
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,360
Pretend it's a Grammy.

251
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,560
Grammy? Grammy it is. Okay.

252
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,880
So I'm gonna take care of this.
Keep up the energy.

253
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,200
Hit that "G," Tom. We're gonna
have a great show tonight, guys.

254
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,840
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

255
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,600
I thought we were taking a jet.

256
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,680
This takes us to the jet.

257
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,680
Oh, wow. This is definitely
going in my diary.

258
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,240
Good evening, Bayonne. Ashley,
where did you get that gorgeous dress?

259
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,240
Don't ask.

260
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,080
- Hi. How are ya?
- Hi.

261
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,040
Guys, you're on.

262
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,880
Gentlemen, enjoy the show.
Cocktails on us.

263
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,040
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the hottest rock band in New York City!

264
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,600
McFly!

265
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,320
Keep on going. I got it.

266
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,520
- Oh!
- Let's get out of here.

267
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,840
Hey, fellas, come on.

268
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,360
You're firing me?
You don't even pay me.

269
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,840
Look, Jake, you're good.
I mean, you did find us.

270
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,840
- It's just-
- But? What's the but?

271
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,040
<i>But we just think
it's time to go home.</i>

272
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,520
No, you can't go back home.
We're this close, guys.

273
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,160
Jake, we haven't had
any lucky breaks over here.

274
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,520
And poor Doug misses his mum.
Yeah, he does. He cries every night.

275
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,880
One week. How's that?

276
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,880
<i>How's that?
You give me one week.</i>

277
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,040
<i>And if I can't make it happen
for you guys by then, then I get it.</i>

278
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,520
We're done. You can go back home.
No hard feelings. One week.

279
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
- Okay. One week.
- One week.

280
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,200
- One week.
- All right!

281
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,280
- Get some rest, guys.
- Mum's gonna have to wait
one more week, Doug.

282
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,480
One week.

283
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,080
So, did you?

284
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Okay, David Pennington
is a gentleman.

285
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,560
- We kissed.
- Boring.

286
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,320
<i>- Check please, Zuki.
- Okay.</i>

287
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,840
<i>- Thank you.
- So, was it a, um, normal kiss...</i>

288
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,320
or was it a supernatural,
tingling in your toes...

289
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,760
butterflies in your tummy
sort of kiss?

290
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,000
It was... enough to get him
to ask me on another date.

291
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,400
Mm!

292
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,680
- Thank you.
- No, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

293
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,920
Uh-W-Wait.
What's that?

294
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,400
Senor Platinum
says lunch is on him.

295
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,840
- I can't stand this.
- What?

296
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,960
Now, on top of everything else, Peggy Braden
has given you worldwide buying power?

297
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,440
Okay, there's positive energy,
and then there's just plain dumb luck.

298
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,520
Here we go again. Maggie, you've known me
since seventh grade, right?

299
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,040
Okay, will you please
tell her that I'm not lucky?

300
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,600
Well, you were voted
prom queen at Franklin High.

301
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,200
- So?
- We went to Jefferson.

302
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,560
- That doesn't mean anything.
- Okay.

303
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,800
- What? Are you kidding me?
- Thank you, Ashley.

304
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Ashley.

305
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,960
- Thank you, Ashley.
- But face it, babe...

306
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,040
when they whacked you with that
lucky stick, they whacked you good.

307
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,640
You guys are silly.

308
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

309
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,200
Okay. All right. If you don't think
you have the luck gene...

310
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
then you wouldn't mind
taking a little test.

311
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,200
<i>- Test?
- Yeah.</i>

312
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
Test? Cool.
What kind of test?

313
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,960
<i>- Ooh, sorry.
- Excusez-moi.</i>

314
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,920
- Hi. One scratcher, please.
- Oh!

315
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,640
- What kind?
- You wanna pick?

316
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,480
- This is not a fair test.
I happen to be good at these.
- The green one.

317
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,000
It's a lottery.
Nobody's good at them.

318
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,320
<i>- Dollar.
- Thank you.</i>

319
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,400
- Guys-
- Come on!

320
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,760
I mean, seriously, this is silly.

321
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,840
- Do it. Do it. Do it.
- Fine. No peeking.

322
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,160
- Why?
- It's my scratcher now.

323
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,400
What'd you get? What'd you get?
What'd you get?

324
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,520
Five, 10, 15.
I told you I was good at these.

325
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,040
You are the luckiest
person in the world.

326
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,160
How do you do it, Ash?
How do you do it?

327
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,680
I told you. You just
scratch the silver boxes.

328
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,200
Scratch? You just scratch?
I could kill you!

329
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,520
Hey, watch it. I can't afford to be injured.
I've got a major event to plan.

330
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,600
And we have a walk-through downtown
with Peggy in 10 minutes.

331
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,880
Taxi! We have to pick up the presentation
boards. We're never gonna make it.

332
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,200
Negativity.
That's your problem.

333
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,160
- That's true. Bye, sweets!
- Make mama proud!

334
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,360
<i>- Of course. Love you.
- Au revoir!</i>

335
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,800
- How you feeling?
- Nervous.

336
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,800
- She's gonna love it.
- Okay.

337
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,800
- How about right here?
- Yeah.

338
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,880
- This place is amazing!
- Quick. She's ready.

339
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,040
- Hi, Miss Braden.
- Uh!

340
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,480
Sorry. Peggy. So, are you
ready to be impressed?

341
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,040
- I'm ready to have questions.
- Of course. I would hope so.

342
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,960
Okay, so we're going
for a carnival-like atmosphere.

343
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,560
We'll have an upscale mixture
of V.I.P.'s, celebs...

344
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,160
<i>and record industry insiders.</i>

345
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,480
Only, everyone will wear masks.

346
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,920
Interesting.

347
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,920
We'll have a deejay,
circus performers...

348
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,240
fortune-tellers,
atmosphere smoke and neon.

349
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,760
Over here will be the V.I.P. Area.

350
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,400
We'll have champagne-
only the best.

351
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,240
<i>Dom Pérignon served
by waiters on stilts></i>

352
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>And then a stage with Masquerade's
latest videos and professional dancers.</i>

353
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,920
<i>And over there, little alcoves...</i>

354
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,760
<i>with couches and with drapes
to give people privacy.</i>

355
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,840
<i>Overhead, sky dancers.</i>

356
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,920
<i>You know, I want people to feel
like anything can happen here.</i>

357
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,120
It's gonna be a magical night.

358
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,720
- The hired dancers?
- Are doing their thing.

359
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
- And Phillips?
- Is happy and is going up in five.

360
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,720
Peggy, I've got it covered.

361
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,960
See that you do, my dear.

362
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,160
Oh, thank God.

363
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Thank you so much.
I owe you big time.

364
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,320
So, which one is she?

365
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,240
<i>Oh, she's the tall blonde one,
near the fortune-teller.</i>

366
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,000
- Ah, very nice.
- Yeah, she's a little high-strung.

367
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,160
<i>No problem.</i>

368
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,400
It is gonna cost you extra.

369
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,680
You're terrible. But a doll.

370
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,680
Now go.
I have work to do.

371
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,680
So do I.

372
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,000
- Got another freeloader.
- What? No, no, no.

373
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,200
If they're not on the list,
they cannot get in. No exceptions.

374
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,680
I'm on the list. "Plus one."

375
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,360
I'm on the list.
It's the jacket!

376
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,960
<i>- Hey, look this way!
- Ow! My foot!</i>

377
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,200
- Sorry. They threw me.
- What a loser!

378
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,520
Of course I'm all right.

379
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,520
<i>Just get the next one.</i>

380
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,560
<i>Yeah, I got these.</i>

381
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,120
Uh, mm, is this
the Masquerade bash?

382
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,480
- Are you Ronald?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

383
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,880
- Th-That's me. Ronald.
- You're late.

384
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,400
- Dancers change in Room 5.
- Okay.

385
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,640
So go on.

386
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,040
Up to Room 5.
Hope these clothes fit.

387
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,000
<i>Just as I thought. The Lovers.</i>

388
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,160
Oh, fantastic!

389
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,640
- See, I told you, baby.
- Ashley!

390
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,640
Antonio. Peggy.

391
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,640
You two look like
you're hitting it off.

392
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,760
Yes, we really are.
Thanks for hooking us up.

393
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,680
- You set us up?
- Guilty as charged.

394
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,000
<i>Well, thank you.
He is adorable.</i>

395
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,760
<i>Oh, my pleasure.
You two look made for each other.</i>

396
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,000
That's what Madame Z just said.

397
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,520
- Did she?
- The Lovers.

398
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,080
Come on, baby.
Let's... dance.

399
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Whoa.

400
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,280
Keep up the good work, Z.

401
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,920
You, come. Don't you want Madame Z
to tell you what's in the cards for you?

402
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,760
- No, it's okay. Save it for the guests.
- Ah, a skeptic.

403
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,520
No, it's just, how many times can you hear,
"You'll meet a handsome stranger"?

404
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,880
Hello? It's called a Tuesday.

405
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,800
What? You think that
good fortune is normal?

406
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,720
Just as I suspected.

407
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,120
What? What'd it say?
Am I gonna win a cruise?

408
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,640
'Cause lately I've been having
that cruise-winning feeling.

409
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,960
Not exactly. It says that good luck
has always spun your way.

410
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,400
<i>Uh-oh. Be careful.</i>

411
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,320
This card, the Wheel of Fortune,
it is upside down.

412
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,480
<i>That means the wheel
may be spinning back.</i>

413
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,320
Right. Yeah. I don't really have time
for the whole spinning wheel thing.

414
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,400
I have 500 guests and a broken
bubble cannon to attend to.

415
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,000
- So go.
- Well, keep up the good work.
People are loving it, Z.

416
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,080
Holy crap.

417
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Yeah! Yeah!

418
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,680
Aren't they fantastic?

419
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,320
<i>Now hear this!</i>

420
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,760
- Now hear this!
- Now hear this!

421
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,840
Are you guys having a good time?

422
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,840
<i>- Do you like the music?
- I love the music!</i>

423
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,680
<i>I said do you like the music?</i>

424
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,760
<i>Ain't nothin' like a Damon party!</i>

425
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,200
And I want to thank you for comin' out
and supporting the Second Street Shelter.

426
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,040
As of right now...

427
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,040
we've raised $270,000!

428
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,600
Give yourselves
a round of applause.

429
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,360
<i>That's a lot of money!
It's not enough.</i>

430
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,200
I promise you,
if you dig deep...

431
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,280
<i>and show me some money,
I'll show you a good time.</i>

432
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Music!

433
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Hit it! Come on! Oh!

434
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,240
<i>Wha- Wha- Ooh, ooh!</i>

435
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Ooh, ooh!
Damn I'm good!

436
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,240
No, no, no, no, no.

437
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,720
- Where's the bubbly? Let's party, yo.
- Mr. Phillips? Excuse me!

438
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,760
Hey. I'm gonna see you at church.

439
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
What's up, man?

440
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,280
Hey, hey. The dancers are
supposed to be on the dance floor.

441
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,960
- And the dance floor is that way.
- Uh, right. Sure.

442
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,280
I just-

443
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,640
I was just about to ask
this lovely lady to dance.

444
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,960
- Oh!
- Oh, sucking up to the boss, huh?

445
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
The bo- Sorry.

446
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,560
You should go dance.
Go dance with him.

447
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,280
<i>- Come on. You're earned it.
This party's amazing.
- He's kinda cute.</i>

448
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,640
You know what? I will.
I deserve to have a little fun tonight.

449
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Ooh. Bye!

450
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,560
<i>Can I go dance? I wanna go dance.
Can I go dance?</i>

451
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,480
- Please.
- Fine. Go, go, go. Play. Play.

452
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,160
- Hey, watch it, jerk!
- Sorry.

453
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,960
- I'm sorry.
- No. No. Don't- Don't be sorry.

454
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,160
I- I, uh-

455
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,880
What? I can't hear you.
It's too loud in here. Let me step outside.

456
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,240
- I have to go.
- What? Wait.

457
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Look, I have to take care of one thing,
but I promise I'll be right back.

458
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,560
<i>- But-
- Just stay where you are. All right?</i>

459
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,560
Okay.

460
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,680
Ashley, who was that?

461
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,680
Um, I honestly don't know.

462
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,760
You were just kissing that guy
you honestly don't know?

463
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah. Yeah. Oh!

464
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,920
- What?
- My shoe.

465
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,080
Oh, my God.

466
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,440
- What?
- My dress.

467
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,920
- My dress!
- At least you're wearing underwear.

468
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,760
<i>That- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
This is the biggest party.</i>

469
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,440
- Mr. Phillips? Excuse me.
- No, no, no, no.

470
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,280
The big-This is the biggest party.
Yes, we're throwin'-

471
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,280
Right. Hey!

472
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,720
- The kid! The kid!
- The guy cut me off! Somebody call 911!

473
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,040
- Unbelievable!
- Are you all right?

474
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,200
- Uh, uh. No. No, I'm okay.
- No, no, no.

475
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,960
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Somebody get an ambulance.

476
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,560
- Uh, no, really. I'm fine.
- Let me help you, man.

477
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,960
- I'm not hurt. Mr. Phillips.
- You're the luckiest son of a gun I've ever seen!

478
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,800
Mr. Phillips, you okay?
You all right?

479
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,480
I'm better than okay, man.
I'm alive!

480
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,800
- You saved my life, Spider-Man.
- It was nothing, really.

481
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,000
There's gotta be a way
I can repay you.

482
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm just glad you're okay.

483
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,000
There's gotta be something
I can do for you.

484
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,680
Um, okay. You know what?
I don't want to put you out or anything...

485
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,000
but this band is exactly
what you're looking for.

486
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,920
- They're the hottest band in New York City.
- It's done.

487
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,000
- If you just-What did you say?
- I said it's done.

488
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,000
- You bring, um- McFly, right?
- Yeah.

489
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,680
Bring McFly by the office,
and we'll have a listen.

490
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,840
Okay.

491
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,080
- Say, kid, what's your name?
- Jake. Jake Hardin.

492
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,680
Jake Hardin, Damon Phillips
owes you big.

493
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,920
Yeah, I'm still here.
This kid saved my life, man.

494
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,040
Is it me,
or did I just get lucky?

495
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,360
She's choking! Breathe, Ashley!
Puke- Puke it up!

496
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,520
<i>- Move it! Get out of my way!
- She's choking!</i>

497
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,520
- Here! Let me help.
- She's red!

498
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,720
<i>- Here.
- Somebody help-</i>

499
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,040
<i>- One more time.</i>

500
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,200
- What was that?
- An olive.

501
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,560
Ash, Ash, look!

502
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:37,240
- No, I did not! Not me!
- Is she getting arrested?

503
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,400
- It's her! Her!
- Who?

504
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Are they pointing at me?
They're pointing at me.

505
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,880
Come on.
Let's get her.

506
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,240
Excuse me.

507
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,720
- They're coming over here.
- Oh, okay.

508
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,560
Move it! Move it!
Out of the way! Out of the way!

509
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,720
- Ashley Albright?
- I'm afraid to say yes.

510
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,920
You're under arrest.

511
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,920
Is this about
Sarah Jessica Parker's dress?

512
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,240
Wait. I mean, no-
I'm gonna give it back!

513
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,240
Wait. I obey the law.
I like the law.

514
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,000
<i> It's been a great night.
I almost got hit by a car.</i>

515
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,000
- And I would-
- Step aside, sir.

516
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,000
<i>Hey, what the hell's going on?</i>

517
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,000
<i>I mean, hello?
Sex and the City?</i>

518
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,280
Sarah Jessica Parker
has so many dresses.

519
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,520
That was so last season.
Is she really gonna miss it?

520
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,920
You're a prostitute?

521
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,280
An escort.
I thought you knew.

522
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,440
I have never been so humiliated.

523
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,440
- Peggy, I-
- Thanks to you and your little alcoves.

524
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,440
"I want people to feel like
anything can happen here."

525
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,800
Oh.

526
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,120
- Oh.
- What are you grinning about?

527
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,040
- I know what's going on here.
- What?

528
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,280
- Where do you think he is?
- Where do I think who is?

529
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,120
Shh. The host.

530
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,480
- The host of what?
- Of this reality show.

531
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,880
Okay, I've figured it out.

532
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,800
You guys can come out
and tell me that I've won now.

533
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,480
- Are you insane?
- Hey, keep it down in there!

534
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,880
Did David Pennington
put you up to this?

535
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,160
<i>- Huh? Did he?
- That's my seat.</i>

536
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,320
I thought this was festival seating.

537
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,000
- Huh?
- This is real life, Ashley.

538
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,320
You not only cost me
my biggest client...

539
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,480
<i>but I can't even imagine what they're
gonna say about me in the Post.</i>

540
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,680
- Braden.
- That's me.

541
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,240
- You made bail.
- Oh, God, thank you.

542
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,840
- Thank you.
- Peggy, I'm sorry.

543
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,680
Oh, and in case
you haven't guessed...

544
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,720
you're fired.

545
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,120
<i>- This way, ma'am.</i>

546
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,200
- Is this your floor too?
- What did you say?

547
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
All right. That's enough.

548
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,880
<i>- Hey, guys.
- Car ready, Tiff?</i>

549
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,120
You know, they're just-
They're...

550
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,560
- a little nervous.
- Mm, go with 'em.

551
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,800
<i>Jake? Jake?</i>

552
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,920
- I'm sorry if that wasn't
exactly what you're look-
- What do you like about 'em?

553
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,640
They have a fresh take on retro,
like early Beatles meets Blink 182.

554
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,440
I'm surprised you don't talk
about record sales and demographics.

555
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,840
Well, it's funny you
should say that, actually.

556
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,640
I think a band that's good
will sell itself.

557
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,160
- An idealist and a purist. I like that.
- Yeah.

558
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,080
I used to be like that once,
but then I decided to become filthy rich.

559
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,600
Uh, okay, well, thanks-
thanks for the opportunity.

560
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,960
Look, kid, I believe in luck.

561
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,360
So I'm gonna send it out to a couple
radio stations, see how it plays.

562
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,960
Meanwhile, you guys work on
a follow-up, okay? You got two weeks.

563
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,280
<i>- So, you're signing the band?</i>

564
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,000
I spent eight minutes with you. Why would I
waste that time if I wasn't signing the band?

565
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Tiffany, call accounting and cut them an
advance check and put them up in a penthouse.

566
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,960
<i>- Okay.
- Now it's been nine minutes. Let's go.</i>

567
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
All right. Bye.

568
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,120
<i>Thanks. Thank you!</i>

569
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,880
Congratulations.

570
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,440
Thanks.

571
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,160
Oh! Oh, my God!

572
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,040
Home.

573
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
Good morning.

574
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,080
Oh.

575
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,440
Do I need a bubble bath.

576
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,120
Hey. Whoa. Isn't that my-

577
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,360
We've gone through pretty much
everything. It's all rated PG-1.

578
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,600
- That's right. We're gonna
have to clear it all out.
- What? Oh, my goodness.

579
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,000
- This your apartment?
- Yes. Um, what happened?

580
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,280
- Flood.
- Flood?

581
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,880
Yeah, it's a, uh, technical term
for a lot of water where it shouldn't be.

582
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,360
It's no big deal though.
We'll take care of it.

583
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,880
<i>- Oh, thank you. Do you mind
if I go in and change now?
- Hey, hey, fellas!</i>

584
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,440
She wants to come in
and change her clothes.

585
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,040
I don't get it. Why are you laughing?

586
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,200
Sweetheart, we got
a grade-four mold infestation.

587
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,280
- You're lucky we found it.
- Lucky. Yeah.

588
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,600
Oh!

589
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,200
- Move it out!
- Easy!

590
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,840
- Do you have my furniture?
- Don't worry about that.

591
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,720
- Oh.
- We'll burn it before it can
contaminate anyone else.

592
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,880
<i>We did manage to save these.</i>

593
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,120
- This is it?
- That's it.

594
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,880
<i> Check with the I.C.
We're gonna need another hose.</i>

595
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,520
<i> We're on it already.
We're gonna do a reverse hose lay.</i>

596
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,240
Hey, you.
Are you okay?

597
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,960
- This is my new apartment?
- I know. It's pretty amazing.

598
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,280
Home theater, satellite TV.

599
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,360
<i>And at night,
with the lights down low...</i>

600
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,440
let's just say this place
is pretty mind-blowing.

601
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,440
Uh, yeah, it's pre- it's pretty mind-
you know, in broad daylight.

602
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,480
Well, the band is down the hall.
The bar and the fridge are fully stocked.

603
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,800
Oh, and just so you know,
D.M.R. Is a really nice place to work.

604
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,600
<i>You know, like at some companies they
don't allow employees to date each other?</i>

605
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,560
Here they do.

606
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,880
Date?

607
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,880
That'd be great!
I'm free all weekend.

608
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,800
Hey, you don't mind
if the girl pays, do ya?

609
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,480
Some guys have
this weird hang-up.

610
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,640
Ooh, gotta split. I'm late
for my erotic massage class.

611
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,080
<i>Catch you later, Spider-Man.</i>

612
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,720
Erotic massage.

613
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,840
<i>Guys, thank you for letting me stay here.
Not only don't I have money...</i>

614
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,280
but the dragon lady's blackballed me
from every firm in the city.

615
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,160
- Well, why don't you phone your parents?
- And admit defeat? No way.

616
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,120
- Yeah.
- So, where should I sleep?

617
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,960
- In your room.
- My room?

618
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,760
Mm-hmm. See, Maggie's room
is right here above the kitchen.

619
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,360
Thanks. And Dana's
is a Jennifer Convertible.

620
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,680
Yeah, so your options
are the La-Z-Boy.

621
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,120
- Mm.
- Soft and sturdy.

622
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,360
And my personal favorite,
the fabulous futon.

623
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,680
- Hmm?
- Perfect.

624
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,360
<i>Well, I'll keep out of your way,
and you guys won't even know I'm here.</i>

625
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,200
- Blow-dryer?
- Oh, yeah. On top of the radiator.

626
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,200
Thanks.

627
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,520
<i>I never noticed. Is your cat all black?</i>

628
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,720
- Yeah. Why?
- Just curious.

629
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,040
Well, this is nice.
We'll have fun.

630
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,400
Everything's gonna be-
Oh, my God!

631
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,200
- What?
- I have a zit.

632
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,400
<i>I have a zit!
Girls, I have a zit!</i>

633
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,720
Ash, are you okay in there?

634
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,720
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, wow!

635
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,000
- Ashley!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

636
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,040
<i>Ash!</i>

637
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,400
<i>- Okay, who's the idiot?
- Nice work!</i>

638
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,120
Ash? Are you okay, Ash?
Hold tight. Hold on. Sweetie?

639
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,920
<i>I broke a mirror.
I broke a mirror. I know.</i>

640
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,680
- Ah.
- I mean, guys, what is going on with me?

641
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,080
You know, I can't take
seven more years of this.

642
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,920
<i>Ever since this masquerade bash,
it's like I'm the anti-Midas...</i>

643
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,360
and everything I touch
turns to crap.

644
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,840
Okay, Ashley,
calm down, all right?

645
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,120
For some reason, the fates
have dealt you a lousy hand.

646
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,280
But the wheel always spins back.

647
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,520
<i>Right?</i>

648
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,680
You're fired.

649
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,280
Oh, my God. I need
to borrow some clothes.

650
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,720
Hello! Open up!

651
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,960
- Hello!
- Yoo-hoo.

652
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,080
- Yes?
- You have ruined my life!

653
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,080
What? Ugh, it's you.

654
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,480
Everything in my life was
perfect until you came around.

655
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,920
<i>Wait a minute.
Was it really perfect?</i>

656
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,480
- You know what?
Don't you psychoanalyze me!
- Whoa.

657
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,160
Okay, just work your voodoo
magic and give me my luck back.

658
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,320
Fine. Concentrate.

659
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,680
Gosh.

660
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,520
All right? It's back.
Now, please, go home.

661
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,520
- I got an early day tomorrow.
- No, no.

662
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,960
Do not patronize me, okay?
You and your cards screwed everything up!

663
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,920
Now you have to fix it.

664
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,000
I tried to warn you,
sweetheart.

665
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,560
Look, did anything unusual
happen at that party?

666
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,520
Well, besides the fact
that I tore my dress...

667
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,600
<i>nearly choked to death
and the felony charges, no.</i>

668
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,360
Yikes.
How about before that?

669
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,680
Well, I mean, I kissed a cute guy,
but that's hardly unusual.

670
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,800
Wait a second. You said that I could
lose it to someone else, right?

671
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,640
So does that mean that
he took my luck from me?

672
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,560
Maybe he needed it
more than you.

673
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,800
So he stole it? That little
whack-kissing bandit!

674
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,720
<i>No, that is just my luck, okay?</i>

675
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,720
And you're gonna help me
and tell me how to get it back.

676
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,040
Me?

677
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,960
Well, let's see. Uh-

678
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,560
If he took it from you with a kiss...

679
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,920
then it stands to reason-

680
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,080
What?

681
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,080
<i>So wait. We're talking
20 professional dancers?</i>

682
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,240
One of these guys' lips are the key
to getting my life back, guys.

683
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,240
- I don't believe it.
- Whoa!

684
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,600
- Hey, get off the sidewalk!
- Take it eas'!

685
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,000
- What am I, a target?
- See, it's ridiculous, right?

686
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,520
You can't get your luck back
by kissing a guy.

687
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,760
I don't believe
how hot these guys are.

688
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,920
Oh, great!
Now you're encouraging her?

689
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,080
Oh, no. I'm just here
to observe and mock.

690
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,840
Guys, I'm just trying to get my life
the way it was again.

691
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,760
Okay, how are you even
gonna know if you kissed the right guy?

692
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,760
Oh, I've got a foolproof test.

693
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,040
Oh! Hey, hey, that's him!

694
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,760
Oh, yeah.

695
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,280
All right!

696
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,960
Oh, my God!
It's definitely him.

697
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,640
<i>Oh, my gosh!
Ashley, he's married!</i>

698
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,640
Ashley!

699
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,560
Michael!

700
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,160
- I suppose that's your sister?
- No, no, muffin, muffin!

701
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,160
Tomato. Sorry.

702
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,720
You ruined my wedding!

703
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,160
Ooh, yeah.

704
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,840
Okay, push, push, push!

705
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,680
- Excuse me. This'll just be a minute.
- Come on.

706
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,520
Sorry.

707
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,680
Here. Here.

708
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,880
Thanks anyway. It's all right.

709
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,200
- Oh, Dana?
- Hmm? What?

710
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,280
Thank you so much.
Feel better.

711
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,640
Please, please, please, please.

712
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,640
Why?

713
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,080
Hi. I'm Dave.

714
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,160
Hey, Lance.
Can you hear me?

715
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,240
Hi. How are you?

716
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,080
Um, okay, here goes.

717
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,520
Oh! Ow!

718
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,600
Girls.

719
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,600
He bit my tongue.

720
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,200
Here.

721
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,280
Oh, come on. Oh.

722
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,600
Ooh! We still have one left.

723
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,600
<i>- Tom Guthrie.
- Spit out the ice, Ash.</i>

724
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,120
- Mm.
- Tom Guthrie.

725
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,800
We've looked for him at, like,
three different addresses already.

726
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,800
Yeah.
You know, you're right.

727
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,120
I'm like the rest of the rabbit
after they cut off its lucky foot.

728
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,800
- I should just give up.
- Come on, Ash. It's not that bad.

729
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,640
Yeah, so you've kissed
a dozen bacteria-ridden strangers.

730
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,200
- You know, you still got your friends.
- Oh, thanks.

731
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,800
But it's probably best
that we no longer touch.

732
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,800
But I love you.

733
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,480
Oh, you love me?
I'm gonna get you.

734
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,480
I'm gonna kiss you.

735
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,000
Pancakes!

736
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,800
Hi, kitty.

737
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,840
Hey, Ash. It's me, David.

738
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,160
Uh, big art opening tonight
at Station "A" Gallery.

739
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,000
<i>- David Pennington!
- Meet you there at 7:00? Don't break my heart.</i>

740
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,560
David Pennington. Another date.

741
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,000
- I'm not going.
- Why not? It's a chance with a great guy.

742
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,680
No. It's a chance
to get hit by a bus. Maggie...

743
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,680
your black cat
is crossing my path.

744
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,680
Not good.

745
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,360
Come on, Pancakes. Don't be scared
of the superstitious, mean lady.

746
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,840
I'm not superstitious, but it's true.
I mean, it's bad luck.

747
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,920
Dane, how's my scope?

748
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,040
Leo. Leo.

749
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,520
- "Your moon is in Uranus."
- Ooh.

750
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,280
Doesn't sound pretty.

751
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,680
He could have canceled.
Isn't that proof enough...

752
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,800
<i>that this whole bad luck thing
is totally bogus?</i>

753
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,800
I don't think so.

754
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,040
Ashley, unlucky girls...

755
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,200
<i>don't get asked out by one of Us Weekly's
most eligible bachelors.</i>

756
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,720
Unlucky girls sit and watch their
more fortunate friends get asked out...

757
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,200
<i>while they sit at home and watch Oprah
and eat last year's Halloween candy.</i>

758
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,040
- That's true.
- You're right.

759
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,560
Of course I'm right.
Go get ready.

760
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,560
You know what?

761
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,080
Maybe I'm not cursed. You know,
I'm just looking at things the wrong way.

762
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,080
And these setbacks
could just be opportunities.

763
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,080
- Of course.
- Exactly.

764
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,400
- Because when one door closes-
- Two others open.

765
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,920
Okay. I'm turning over a new leaf,
and my good luck starts now.

766
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,080
Good.

767
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,080
It's okay.

768
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,440
Oh-

769
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,240
Did you just put that
back in your eye?

770
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,920
- It was my last one, guys.
- That's really gross.

771
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,280
Ow! My eye!

772
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,040
But, you see,
I- I'm on the list. I'm "plus one."

773
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,600
David Pennington, plus one.

774
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,280
- Hi, David.
- There he is. See? There he is.

775
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,440
- Oh, hey.
- David Pennington. There.

776
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,280
No, no, no. There.
She's- She's with me.

777
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,800
Thank you. Oh!

778
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,960
Ooh.

779
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,880
I'm okay. Fine.

780
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,960
Come on.
I got a surprise for you.

781
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,800
Oh, my God.

782
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,800
<i>Would you look at that big, ugly...</i>

783
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,800
- brown pile of-
- Uh, Ashley-

784
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,320
It looked like it came out of the rear end
of an elephant.

785
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,640
- Ashley.
- Huh?

786
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,920
Uh-
Meet my mother, the artist.

787
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,560
- Hmm.
- The artist.

788
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,480
Hi, Mrs. Pennington.

789
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,680
You know, you look
so much younger in person.

790
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,480
Not that I mean
you're old or anything.

791
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,680
David, if I'm going to listen to this,
I'll need vodka.

792
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,680
Good idea.

793
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,320
<i>- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.</i>

794
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,520
Sure. Hmm?

795
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,360
No, thank you.

796
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,920
<i>David, darling, that awful man
from the Times is here.</i>

797
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,840
It's him.

798
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,440
- That son of a-
- Excuse me.

799
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,840
Yeah? Oh, um, the waiter.
He was just-

800
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,880
- More your type? I totally agree.
- Wha-

801
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,520
- Mother, please.
- Um, if you two don't mind,
I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.

802
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,360
You! Finally.

803
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,560
- Excuse me?
- You're gonna keep your tongue
in your mouth at all times...

804
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,200
- 'cause this is strictly business.
- What?

805
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,360
- Give me back my luck. Come here.
- What the-

806
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,200
- Let go of me.
- Just- Uh-oh.

807
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,880
<i> From the bowels of this
mortal coil come... the mud men.</i>

808
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,240
- Kiss me, damn it!
- Let me up! I'm in the show!

809
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,800
<i>- I am a mud man.
- I am a mud woman.</i>

810
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,240
<i>We are mud people...</i>

811
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,640
<i>and he is our mud king.</i>

812
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,240
- Heart attack! I know C.P. R!
- I'm not having-

813
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,240
<i>He's not breathing!</i>

814
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,160
He's totally breathing!

815
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,760
No, he's not.
It's a cardiac reflex thing.

816
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,680
- I need to give him mouth-to-mouth.
- I can't breathe.

817
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,440
Mmm.

818
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,440
He's gonna be okay.

819
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,040
- Sorry.
- Lucky you were here.

820
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,120
Lucky you know C.P.R.

821
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,520
Yeah. You know what?
That's me. Lucky.

822
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,520
You know, I'm feeling
kind of- Oh!

823
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,800
<i>Oh.</i>

824
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,800
<i>Irreplaceable!</i>

825
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,440
<i>It's ruined.</i>

826
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,800
This is ridiculous. It was just mud.

827
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,120
You must have met my twin sister.
She was in here the other night.

828
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,120
<i>She's the bitch.
I'm the nice one.</i>

829
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,840
- What can I get you?
- Um, can I just have a glass of water?

830
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,280
No buy, no sit. See?

831
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,760
Can I use the bathroom?

832
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,440
N-No buy, no bathroom!

833
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,120
Okay. Great. Fine. Fine.
I'm leaving.

834
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,520
I'm leaving. Oh, are you all
enjoying the show?

835
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,960
You know, the real me
doesn't have days like this.

836
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,520
As a matter of fact,
maybe I'm not even here right now.

837
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,520
<i>This is all probably
a- a dream that I'm having...</i>

838
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,880
induced by a-
a deep-tissue massage.

839
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,880
<i>- Yes. A massage that I won at a charity raffle.
- Shut up.</i>

840
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,720
<i>That looks good.
Are you done with that?</i>

841
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,720
No. That was a joke.
I'm not gonna eat your scraps.

842
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,200
Gosh! Maybe just some bacon.

843
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,160
Mmm! Mmm!

844
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,400
I don't know what she's doing.

845
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,720
Mmm! Mmm!

846
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,720
Oh, my God.
I'm like a coyote.

847
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,080
Perfect.

848
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,400
Oh, not the salt.

849
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,920
Just so everyone knows...

850
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,080
<i>I think what I'm about to do is completely
ridiculous, but it can't hurt, can it?</i>

851
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,080
<i>Come on.</i>

852
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,240
- My eye!
- Oh, my God!

853
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,920
Oh! Oh, my-

854
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,160
- It was an accident. I'm sorry.
- Miss, I think it's, uh...

855
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,240
<i>- time to go now.
- Oh, my God. All right.</i>

856
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,080
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

857
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,000
<i>- I think we're clear.
- Thanks for that. Sorry.</i>

858
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,120
- I couldn't help but overhear your, uh-
- Oh, meltdown?

859
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,960
<i>- Yeah. Broke. Jobless.
And I just ate le jambon d'étranger></i>

860
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,760
- What?
- A stranger's bacon. I thought
it would sound better in French.

861
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,440
- Oh.
- Guess not.

862
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:54,120
You looked a little hungry. I thought you
could use this. Turkey on rye, extra mustard.

863
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,800
Oh. Yes. Thank you.

864
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,720
- Thanks. Um, nice to meet you.
- Okay. Yeah.

865
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,800
I'm gonna-

866
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,120
Look. I know of a job-
if you're looking for one.

867
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,120
Really? What's the scam?

868
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,320
- No scam.
- Well, do you want me to
join your religion or something?

869
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,640
No. No religion stuff.

870
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,000
It's just a job. You know, a bad job.
Crummy pay for crummy hours.

871
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,480
That still doesn't answer
my question. What's the scam?

872
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,640
Let's just say I know
what it's like to be S.O.L.

873
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,320
- S.O. L?
- "Shit out of luck."

874
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,320
What makes you think I'm S.O. L?
Just because I spilt the salt back there?

875
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,000
Yeah.

876
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,320
Oh!

877
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,680
Look. Where you are right now,
I've been there.

878
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,680
Been there? I lived there.
I was kind of the mayor of there.

879
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,840
I'm Jake.

880
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,160
Ashley.

881
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,280
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, yeah. No, you got it.

882
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,280
- Oh, my gosh.
- Looks great on you.

883
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,200
Can anything else-
I mean, to be honest...

884
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,840
I'm not really dressed for
a job interview right now.

885
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,680
For this one
I think you'll be fine.

886
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,760
- Okay.
- Wanna check it out?

887
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,960
- Why are you so nice?
- Why-Just- Look. I mean...

888
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,680
shit out of luck-
That's my thing.

889
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
...put me in this position.
- You're gonna love her.

890
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,960
- This is not fair. Listen.
- She's great.

891
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,440
- I don't need another loser waitress here.
- Okay, Mac. Okay.

892
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,640
You won't be sorry.

893
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,400
- I didn't get it.
- No, no, no, no, no. No, no. It's not that.

894
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,560
You can have the job,
but it's my old job.

895
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,400
So?

896
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,800
Well, see, I- I'd hoped he would hire you
as a waitress or something.

897
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,960
My old gig was kind of a- like a janitor,
food delivery person, toilet attendant.

898
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,720
I'll take it. I'll take it.

899
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,240
Whoa! God!

900
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,600
Whoa! Whoa!

901
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,080
Whoa. Oh!

902
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,920
Oh!

903
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,440
God.

904
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,280
Oh! Oh!

905
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,040
Oh!

906
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,720
Oh!

907
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,800
Ow! Oh! Oh! Oh!

908
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,800
Oh.

909
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,160
Oh! Oh!

910
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,240
Oh!

911
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,000
What the-

912
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,600
I'll clean that up.

913
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,920
Come on, boys.
Move it or lose it. Let's go.

914
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,880
There we go.

915
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,040
<i>Before Phillips will release the album,
he wants to see you play a larger space...</i>

916
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,040
- like the Knitting Factory.
- Oh!

917
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,960
See if you can hold a big crowd
for an hour, create some preheat. Huh?

918
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,320
- Yeah! When?
- I don't know.

919
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,960
Guys! Listen. Carley, turn the radio up.

920
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,400
- No way!
- That's it! That's it!

921
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,240
Let's celebrate.
Burgers and fries on me.

922
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,880
All right.

923
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,400
Hey, sweetie. You, uh, scamper up
that ladder and- and fix that light.

924
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,080
- Well, I'm not so good with-
- Thanks.

925
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,080
Heights.

926
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,560
<i> That's McFly,
a new British invasion band-</i>

927
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:51,240
Phillips will tell us tonight. In the meantime,
we have to focus on fine-tuning-

928
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,760
Whoa.

929
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,080
Track-
See, that's not good.

930
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,080
<i>She should have gone up
without the bulb...</i>

931
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,760
then brought down the old one,
because now she's gonna be juggling-

932
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,920
Eh! Hey!

933
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,600
- You know where the broom is.
- Yeah. I'll-

934
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,960
And she should have turned off the light
first because now she's gonna be-

935
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,600
Electrocuted.

936
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,960
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

937
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,960
Hi.

938
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,520
So, other than, uh, you know,
getting zapped, how's the job working out?

939
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,560
<i>- Oh, I can't complain.
- That's good.</i>

940
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,280
No. I mean I'm literally not allowed
to complain. I had to sign something.

941
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,480
Oh. I remember that.

942
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,960
- This is cold, so it'll help.
- You're very handy with this stuff.

943
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,320
- Thanks.
- Ah, that feels good.

944
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:54,400
- Is that toothpaste?
- Yeah. It's an ancient Chinese
remedy for burned fingers.

945
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,640
Yeah. It pays to be prepared.

946
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,640
I've got everything in this backpack.

947
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,160
I have first aid, extra socks.

948
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,720
- Isn't that a bit defeatist?
- No, it's being a realist. You've been out there.

949
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,160
Hey. Let me see your cell phone.

950
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,160
Why?

951
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,760
- What the-What is this?
- Oh. Flip it like that.

952
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,760
Like that.

953
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,000
Address book.

954
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,080
"Bergdorf's, Bendel's and sushi."

955
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,440
Are you nuts?
Unlucky people need hospitals.

956
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,080
<i>Also, never call 911.
They take forever.</i>

957
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,760
Fire responds. They're great.

958
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,360
National Poison Control Center.
Ask for Lou. He's very good.

959
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,840
You know what? Um...

960
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,760
this backpack has seen me through
just about everything.

961
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,360
<i>And...</i>

962
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,800
I think it's time to pass it on.

963
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,520
- Oh. No, no, no. I couldn't.
- No. No. Honestly, I think you should have it.

964
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,360
- Please. You need it more than I do.
- Thank you.

965
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,880
Uh, I better take this.

966
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,880
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
- Hey, Katy. How's my girl? What?

967
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,880
Your key? You checked the doormat?

968
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,880
Um, okay. What-What if I pick you up,
take you to the new place?

969
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,240
Yeah. You'll love it.
It's huge.

970
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,880
<i>Okay. We'll have pizza.
It'll be fun.</i>

971
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,720
- I gotta run.
- Okay. Uh, yeah.

972
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,720
<i>See ya, Ashley. Uh, it's just a-
It's a girl. Yeah. No.</i>

973
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,120
Hey. Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on.

974
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,920
- Hey, guys. Sounds good.
- How you doing? Thank you.

975
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,040
- What's going on?
- Look, Jake. The Knitting Factory fell through.

976
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,360
- What?
- Oh, you're joking.

977
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,800
- That sucks.
- But "Five Colors" has been
gettin' great radio play...

978
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,280
<i>so I decided to book our boys
at the new Hard Rock Cafe Times Square.</i>

979
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,960
No way!

980
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,800
<i>- Who's your boy, huh? This is big!
- Beauty!</i>

981
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,800
This is-This is big. How's my follow-up coming?

982
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,120
We're-We're working on it.

983
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,320
- Uh-
- All right. That's good. Don't let me stop you.

984
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,640
- Sounds good, guys. Congratulations.
- All right. Have a good one.

985
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,960
So, um, Jake, when are we gonna
hear this amazing follow-up?

986
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,160
- When you guys write it.
- Right.

987
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,480
Hey, Jake.
You got a delivery.

988
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,640
Over there.

989
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,320
<i> Hey. Isn't that that bird
from the bowling alley?</i>

990
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,840
<i>- Yeah. The electrocuted one.
- Hey, Jakey.</i>

991
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,400
Danny, let's work on your vocals
for "Too Close for Comfort."

992
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,480
I think we're on the right track.
Just tighten it up a little bit.

993
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,160
Okay. We're-We're gonna take it
from the second verse.

994
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

995
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,680
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

996
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,080
- Thanks. Oh!
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

997
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,680
- I'm- I'm sorry about-
- No. Don't worry about it.

998
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,840
Come on in.
Check out this song.

999
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,120
Sounds great, Tim.

1000
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,200
- They sound good.
- Yeah. Yeah. They do, don't they?

1001
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,120
- Yeah.
- So, did you hear we're playing
the new Hard Rock?

1002
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,360
- Wow. That's great.
- Yeah. Well, besides the fact
that it's a huge space...

1003
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,640
I'm probably not gonna
be able to fill it...

1004
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,520
- and I'm kind of dead.
- It's tough, but not impossible.

1005
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,560
So, you think maybe, uh,
you'd want to go to coffee later...

1006
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,160
or something maybe?

1007
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,400
Yeah, um-
That'd be nice.

1008
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,720
Oh. There she is.

1009
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,080
- Oh. Is- Is that Katy?
- Yeah.

1010
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,560
She's cute, huh?
She picked out this jacket.

1011
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,240
- Oh. Nice.
- Yeah.

1012
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,760
- Looks like a tramp.
- What?

1013
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,920
What? Camp. Camp. She looks
like someone I went to camp with.

1014
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,920
- Yeah.
- Strange.

1015
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,920
Weird.

1016
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,600
You know, I- I better get going.
Uh, Mac wants me to reset the rat trap.

1017
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,600
So, should I call you tonight?

1018
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,440
Um, yeah, about that-
Oh, geez.

1019
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,280
Um, yeah. Some other time maybe.
I have other plans.

1020
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,520
<i>- If that's cool. Sorry about that again.
- That's okay.</i>

1021
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,520
- Bye.
- Bye.

1022
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,520
Oh!

1023
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,640
- Thanks for the ride, Jake.
- Yeah. Hold up one second.

1024
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,560
Um, so I'll see you later?

1025
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,960
Tell Aunt Martha I'm gonna send
Bernie with the car to pick you up.
Don't forget your homework.

1026
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,640
- Yeah, yeah. I hear ya. Later.
- All right. See ya.

1027
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,160
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

1028
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,000
Don't open the umbrella.
Not inside.

1029
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,640
Very unlucky.

1030
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,840
Oh! Oh!

1031
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,160
<i>- Bernie.
- Yes, sir?</i>

1032
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,840
Back it up, will ya?

1033
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,760
Oh, God.

1034
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,760
You know, there's a poncho
in that backpack.

1035
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,800
I didn't even think to- to look.

1036
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,040
Can I give you a ride?

1037
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,200
I only live 29 blocks from here.

1038
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,720
Uh, at least take my umbrella.

1039
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,360
I already have one.

1040
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,640
You know,
I got a washer-dryer, uh...

1041
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:39,120
microwave popcorn,
satellite TV.

1042
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,720
No. I- I-
I really shouldn't.

1043
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,240
Look. I don't do this
for just anybody, but...

1044
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,720
I'll even throw in some hot chocolate
with those little tiny marshmallows.

1045
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,080
I love the tiny marshmallows.

1046
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,560
How about you toss
the lightning rod and get in?

1047
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,640
Oh.

1048
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,560
Thank you.

1049
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,920
- Nice place.
- Yeah. Um-

1050
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,760
We should get you some dry clothes.
Here. Let me get this.

1051
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,760
- Oh, thank you.
- Laundry room's that way.
Bathroom's right over there.

1052
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,960
Uh, kitchen's right here. Go whichever way
you think you should go.

1053
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,040
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Sure.

1054
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,960
Mind if I throw some of my clothes
in with yours?

1055
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,960
No. Not at all. Wow.
Laundry room in your apartment.

1056
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,120
- As far as I'm concerned,
that's when you know you've arrived.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool.

1057
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,280
You know what?
I should wash this too. Hold on.

1058
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,280
Okay.

1059
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,320
Oh. Oh, shoot.

1060
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,920
- Toss this in for me, will ya?
- Um, yeah. Sure.

1061
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,000
Thanks.

1062
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,480
- Oh. I should get this. I'll be right back.
- Okay. I'll be in here.

1063
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,480
Since when does a washing machine
need an L.C.D. Screen?

1064
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,040
Okay.

1065
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,680
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
What is going on?

1066
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,000
Oh, my gosh.

1067
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,400
Oh, no!

1068
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,680
Stop! Please stop! Stop!

1069
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,200
Um, off.

1070
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,720
Off!

1071
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,200
What are you, possessed? Oh!

1072
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,960
- Everything okay in there?
- Yeah! Everything's fine.

1073
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,040
<i>- Okay.
- Oh!</i>

1074
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,400
What is going on?
Okay. Water off.

1075
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,560
Water off! Oh!

1076
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,160
Oh, God!

1077
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,400
Off! Off!

1078
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,200
No, not spin!

1079
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,960
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1080
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,000
Hello?

1081
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,560
Oh, my God. Oh!

1082
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,400
<i>- Stop! Please stop!
- Okay. Uh-</i>

1083
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,400
I'm sorry.

1084
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,240
I'm so sorry.

1085
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,920
I got it. I got it. I got-

1086
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,680
How'd you do that?

1087
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,520
Uh, there's a- there's an off button
on the L.C.D. Screen.

1088
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:03,080
What can I say? I am a pathetic
disaster, and I give up.

1089
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,240
- You give up?
- I give up. I don't care anymore.

1090
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,600
You know what?
It feels great.

1091
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,320
You know what? I gave up years ago.
It's my secret to happiness.

1092
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,840
Oh! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1093
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,200
- Play fair.
- Oh.

1094
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,760
- Ow.
- Oh, no.

1095
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:25,960
- Oh, man.
- Your eye?

1096
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,440
- You're done.
- I'm sorry.

1097
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,440
No.

1098
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,120
Oh, cool!

1099
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,960
Oh, am I interrupting something?

1100
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,360
- Hi, Katy.
- Hi.

1101
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:44,720
- Wait. You're Katy?
- Last time I checked.

1102
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,880
Hi. I'm Ashley.

1103
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,640
<i>No. No, that's not a problem.
I'm on it. Yeah.</i>

1104
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,320
So, Jake tells me you're a loser.

1105
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,640
What? I'm not a loser.

1106
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,480
That's cool.
I'm a loser too.

1107
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,280
Anyway, it's just like a term of affection,
not a permanent condition.

1108
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,840
- Oh.
- You just haven't had any good luck. That's all.

1109
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,480
No, no. It's great.

1110
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,320
I love these
little marshmallow things.

1111
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,680
So do I.

1112
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,920
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
We'll talk later. All right, sir. Bye.

1113
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,920
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Hot.</i>

1114
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,600
- What's the problem?
- Oh, Phillips wants the new
song ready before the concert.

1115
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:25,000
- And?
- And we don't have shit.

1116
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,680
I mean shoot.
We don't have shoot.

1117
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,680
<i>We don't have to tell Aunt Martha
about this, do we?</i>

1118
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,360
<i>Don't stress it.
I'll write you a kick-ass song.</i>

1119
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,200
<i>Oh, so you're a-you're a songwriter now?
Very funny.</i>

1120
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,240
- You could be more supportive.
- This is serious.

1121
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,200
- This is my life we're-
- Guy- Guys-

1122
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,200
- No shoot.
- No shoot. That-

1123
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,840
Uh- I think I can help you out.

1124
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,520
What do you have in mind?

1125
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,120
Well, I have this friend-

1126
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,480
What a song.

1127
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,880
I totally understand. If you don't
want to use it, it's cool.

1128
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,920
No. No, it's great.

1129
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,080
<i>Just a few little adjustments.</i>

1130
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,240
Hey, Harry.
Double the tempo.

1131
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,560
Danny, Tom, why don't you
kick it off tight and rough it up a bit?

1132
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:50,240
- Ashley.
- Yeah?

1133
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,920
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1134
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,200
Hey.

1135
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,960
So I hear a rumor that, uh,
you have another hit for me.

1136
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,280
Well, it's, uh- it's rough,
but I got a good feeling, sir. Yeah.

1137
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Sounds good. Positivity.
That's what I like.

1138
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,800
Oh, yeah. Congratulations
on, uh, selling out.

1139
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,880
Selling out?

1140
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,880
You mean the Hard Rock?
We sold out the Hard Rock?

1141
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,920
- I BlackBerried you.
- I don't have a BlackBerry.

1142
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,880
- Tiffany, get him a BlackBerry.
- Yes.

1143
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,480
- There's a line around the corner
of people just hoping to get in.
- Ah?

1144
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,160
Hey, hey, hey. I don't hug people,
but, look, bro.

1145
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,640
You saved my life twice. Once
at the masquerade bash and- and now.

1146
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,640
<i>I- It was
a great night for me too.</i>

1147
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,080
I mean, ever since then I've been
about the luckiest guy in the world.

1148
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,640
Look. Come by my office later.

1149
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,640
<i>- It can't be.
- I got some ideas.</i>

1150
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,000
<i>- Okay.
- Geez.</i>

1151
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,760
Jake. Jake is the guy I kissed
at the masquerade bash.

1152
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,160
- Uh-uh.
- Yes.

1153
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,480
- No.
- Yes.

1154
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,000
- No.
- Yes.

1155
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,440
Yes! That's great. He's hot.

1156
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,520
You don't understand.
If I kiss Jake...

1157
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,840
it's hello,
fabulous carefree life.

1158
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,440
And that's a problem?

1159
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,520
- Well-
- Go.

1160
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,960
- Ashley.
- No, no, no.

1161
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,040
Um, I have to go now.

1162
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,880
Uh, now?

1163
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,120
<i>- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.</i>

1164
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,400
Taxi!

1165
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,320
Sorry. I was just
checking something.

1166
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,480
Five dollars. Yes.

1167
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,560
- Thank you, luck.
- Ashley?

1168
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,640
Miss Braden.

1169
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,240
Listen. I am so sorry for-

1170
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,520
- Antonio?
- Hey, Ash.

1171
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,160
- Hi.
- How lucky that we ran into you.

1172
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,920
I feel just horrible about
those things I said to you.

1173
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,440
No. Stop. You were right
to blame it all on me.

1174
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:48,080
Then let me blame you for bringing this sweet,
wonderful, iron-tushed man into my life.

1175
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,280
Yes. We're getting married, baby.

1176
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,920
- No way!
- It's true. I bought him the ring.

1177
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,760
<i>- Well, good for you guys. Congratulations.
- Ashley...</i>

1178
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,120
I want you to come back
to work for me.

1179
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:04,560
- Are you kidding?
- I can't lose you. You are my good luck charm.

1180
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,280
I- I don't know what to say.

1181
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:09,960
Well, we have a huge pitch tonight.
St. Regis at 8:00.

1182
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,520
So, say you'll be by my side...

1183
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:16,120
and say you'll be wearing something
appropriate to your new vice president title.

1184
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,960
Oh, my gosh. Yes. Yes.
Thank you.

1185
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,960
- Bye.
- Bye.

1186
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,640
Oh! Yes! My luck is back!

1187
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,640
Oh, my God.

1188
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,680
<i>- Hello.
- Ash?</i>

1189
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,640
Anyone want some late lunch?

1190
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,720
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

1191
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,160
Hey. I have some surprises.

1192
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:42,240
Ta-da! Last one in stock,
and just my size. Lucky, huh?

1193
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,160
- Yeah.
- And I went to Miyakami
and got two orders of everything...

1194
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,840
'cause I thought we could use
a little celebration.

1195
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,080
- That's nice.
- Oh. Yeah.

1196
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,000
What's wrong?

1197
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,680
The band isn't
gonna do Maggie's song.

1198
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,400
What? Why not?

1199
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,000
Phillips is superstitious.

1200
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,840
<i>- Come on.
- He thinks that new groups...</i>

1201
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,680
should only perform music
that they've written themselves.

1202
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,440
- That's crazy.
- No. It's just bad luck.

1203
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,840
<i>Look. I'm sorry this is happening.
I didn't have anything to do with-</i>

1204
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,760
Ashley, stop. It's not your fault.
It's life. Right?

1205
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,360
Come on. We gotta get going. We gotta get
there before they go on. I want to wish them luck.

1206
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,880
- You're still going?
- Oh, yeah. We have V.I.P.
Tickets. Why waste 'em? You?

1207
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:28,200
Um, actually, I'm not. I have, um, a meeting.

1208
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:31,160
- Job interview?
- Actually, it's a funny story.

1209
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,200
<i>- Um, Peggy rehired me.
- Ashley!</i>

1210
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,400
I am so proud of you.

1211
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,880
You totally stuck it out,
and it all got better.

1212
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,040
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

1213
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,040
Of course.
What choice do I have?

1214
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,400
If you dwell on
all the bad things in life...

1215
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,000
- you miss out on all the good things.
- It's getting late.

1216
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,800
- Well, have fun.
- Good luck on your meeting, Ashley.

1217
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,880
Thanks.

1218
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,080
<i>Bye.</i>

1219
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,360
Cool!

1220
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,280
- We're down front!
- Wow!

1221
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,280
<i>- So big!
- So many people.</i>

1222
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,320
<i>Look how many people there are.</i>

1223
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,800
- Hottie, mate. There's a hottie there.
- Yeah.

1224
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,360
I hope it goes well.

1225
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,720
All right. Guys, guys. Final touches.
Dressing room now. Come on.

1226
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,120
- Let's do this. Come on.
- I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous.

1227
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,640
Hey, Nick. Nick.
How are ya?

1228
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,120
Oh, bollocks!

1229
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,800
<i>You look very nervous.</i>

1230
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,640
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- Want some herbal tea? We have some.

1231
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,480
<i> Thank you.
That would be great.</i>

1232
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,120
<i>The monitors hot
for Danny and Tom, right?</i>

1233
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,400
<i>- The input for the reverb
in the distortion pedals?
- Two and three.</i>

1234
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,320
<i>Good. And just remember.
The switch-outs at three, five and nine.</i>

1235
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,720
- Right. Right.
- Someone could fall down
in this. I'm gonna shut it.

1236
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,560
Whoa!

1237
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,760
<i>Hello?</i>

1238
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,560
Jake? Guys?

1239
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,480
Cab! Taxi!

1240
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,320
- Oy!
- We're never gonna get a cab at this hour.

1241
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,400
Think positive.

1242
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,160
Hey. Guys.
Jump in. Come on.

1243
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,520
Ashley.

1244
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,000
- Let's go. We don't have much time.
- What are you doing?

1245
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,760
I can't stop sweatin'.

1246
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,760
<i> Shocking!</i>

1247
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,760
- You guys ready?
- Yeah. Stoked.

1248
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,680
Yeah. Born ready.

1249
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,360
<i>- My eye!
- My "A" string.</i>

1250
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,360
<i>Danny, look at me.
You can see, right?</i>

1251
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,360
See, please?

1252
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,360
Two minutes, you guys.
Good luck.

1253
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,680
<i>Two minutes?
I- I need some ice. I need some ice.</i>

1254
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,280
Hello!

1255
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,880
Guys, I'm here!

1256
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:27,200
Okay. Look. I know you guys
are nervous. That's fine. Just-

1257
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,120
Hold that thought.

1258
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,320
Good idea.

1259
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:40,160
- Whoo!
- Air fre-Air freshener.

1260
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,400
Oh, by the way, have you seen
Harry anywhere?

1261
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,200
He's- He's not here?

1262
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,400
Hello?

1263
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,760
- Okay, guys. Spread out, find him.
- All right.

1264
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,720
- Nick. Nick.
- Harry.

1265
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,800
- Yeah.
- Uh, have you seen- have you seen Harry?

1266
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,840
- Who?
- Harry the drummer.

1267
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,920
- Who?
- Uh- Harry!

1268
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,240
Harry!

1269
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,240
Harry.

1270
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,240
<i>- Harry.
- Get out of here!</i>

1271
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,920
<i>- Pervert!
- Sorry.</i>

1272
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,920
D.M.R.'s got the money, baby!

1273
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,280
Excuse me, sir. Could you make a left
up ahead? Union Square's always a mess.

1274
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,280
I can't believe
you blew off Peggy Braden.

1275
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,280
She'll get over it. If Jake's bad luck
is half as bad as mine was...

1276
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,360
then we don't have much time.

1277
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,600
Harry. Harry, are you in here?

1278
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,640
- Hey. Has anyone seen Harry?
- No.

1279
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,640
- Excuse me. Has anyone
seen Harry? The drummer.
- No.

1280
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,760
- Harry!
- Has- Has anybody got a 20 on the drummer?

1281
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,800
What's he look like?

1282
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,280
Yeah. I don't know.
They all look alike to me.

1283
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,120
Harry!

1284
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,480
Harry.

1285
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,320
<i>- Harry.
- Start the show!</i>

1286
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,400
Harry.

1287
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,680
<i>- He's not here.
- We want McFly!</i>

1288
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,800
He's not here either.

1289
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:21,160
Ah, but then- No, no. No, no, no.

1290
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,120
- Jake, baby!
- Hey!

1291
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:26,280
I understand the drill- keep 'em waiting-
but the natives are gettin' restless.

1292
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,480
<i>- We thought it was normal
to go up a half hour late.
- Jake.</i>

1293
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,160
Jake, we can't find Harry anywhere.
He's not upstairs. He's gone.

1294
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,320
- Checked the loos. He's not in men's or women's.
- No.

1295
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,640
There something
you want to tell me, Jake?

1296
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,800
We-We have a problem.

1297
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:47,560
Hello?
What the hell is that?

1298
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,120
- Oh! We're so late. Come on! Come on!
- Oh, my gosh!

1299
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,440
Thank you! Wait. You guys.
You guys. Backstage is this way.

1300
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,120
Come on. Hi. Excuse me.
Watch out, buddy.

1301
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,320
- Come on!
- Hold on a second, girls.

1302
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,400
Catch up, Dana.
You got the passes.

1303
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,200
<i>Let's go!</i>

1304
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,600
Hello.

1305
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,120
<i>Hello.</i>

1306
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,880
And I, for one...

1307
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,600
am not looking forward to going
out here and telling this angry crowd...

1308
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,320
that the band decided
not to play.

1309
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,760
Oh. That won't be me.

1310
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,720
That's gonna be you.

1311
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,160
<i>Unless you get your boys
out there now!</i>

1312
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:36,160
<i>Mr. Phillips,
without a-a drummer?</i>

1313
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,200
- No way.
- It won't work.

1314
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:43,560
<i>Hey, guys. I used to be the, uh, backup
drummer for, uh, Whitesnake.</i>

1315
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:46,240
<i>- Whitesnake? Hell, yeah!</i>

1316
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,560
- There you go. Here's your drummer.
- Wait a minute.

1317
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,760
<i>- We're not gonna go out there without Harry.
- It's not gonna happen.</i>

1318
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,800
McFly doesn't play...

1319
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,760
you'll be lucky enough
to manage...

1320
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,440
<i>- a high school marching band.
- Jake.</i>

1321
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,080
- Get out of the way.
- We got a problem. We need a new band.

1322
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:03,440
<i>- Cancel the limo.
- Get out of the way, please. All right. Now go.</i>

1323
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,440
Ashley, now's not a-

1324
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,080
- What the hell is this?
- Shh!

1325
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:19,760
And in nine, eight, seven-

1326
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,880
- Oh, no.
- Who hit the smoke?

1327
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:27,800
Five, four, three-

1328
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,120
Whoa.

1329
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,120
Two-

1330
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,120
Whoa.

1331
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,960
Is that- Is that Harry?

1332
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,880
<i>Get started, baby!</i>

1333
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,240
We're on. We're on.

1334
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:52,680
No way. The freak went on without us.

1335
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,160
I don't believe it.

1336
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,600
Hey. Do me a favor.

1337
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,720
- Play Maggie's song.
- Absolutely.

1338
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,880
Hey. Let's kick it off
with "I've Got You."

1339
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,920
Yeah. Definitely.
Come on. Let's go.

1340
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,760
<i>- Phillips is gonna be pissed.
- Who cares?</i>

1341
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,840
Harry. Harry, we're playing
"I've Got You."

1342
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:29,360
Ashley. Thank you.

1343
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,200
You're welcome.

1344
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,680
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

1345
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,800
Oh, I'm proud of you.

1346
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,400
- Katy!
- Yes!

1347
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,600
- They're great!
- It's good!

1348
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,640
Danny! Whoo!

1349
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,400
I thought I told you
not to play this song.

1350
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:36,600
Well, I guess
I'm not superstitious.

1351
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:39,160
But I am.

1352
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,720
I should fire you, Jake.

1353
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,600
But it works.

1354
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,080
It works. Good job.

1355
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,920
Thank you.

1356
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,120
They're playing my song!

1357
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,480
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1358
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,080
Is that the sound
of them clapping...

1359
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:30,320
- or my nervous system shutting down?
- No. They're clapping.

1360
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,320
Hello, Times Square!

1361
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,040
- Congratulations!
- Ashley, thank you!

1362
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,800
<i>- Great to be here, everybody.</i>

1363
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:05,240
Oh. Who wants to meet
my friend Mr. Dom Pérignon?

1364
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,320
- That would be the '94?
- Yeah!

1365
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,920
<i>- The '95! Yeah, baby!
- Yeah. That's okay.</i>

1366
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,440
<i>All right, guys.
Champagne time! Everybody.</i>

1367
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,440
McFly on three. On three.
Champagne time.

1368
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:21,520
One- Help me out.
One, two, three!

1369
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:25,680
McFly!

1370
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,880
All right. Danny. Everybody.
Get over here. Come on.

1371
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,200
<i>Come on. Come on. Let's go, baby.</i>

1372
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:38,280
Ashley.

1373
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:41,960
- Come on. Let's go celebrate.
- Hey. Um, not now.

1374
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,960
What's wrong with you?
You look miserable.

1375
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,720
Maggie,
I think I've fallen for him.

1376
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,960
That's great.
What's the matter with that?

1377
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:00,960
I don't know. I mean, the feelings
I have generally lead toward kissing.

1378
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,720
So kiss him. Kiss him!

1379
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,240
I can't.

1380
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,320
Oh, Ash.

1381
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,560
Please don't tell me
you still believe in that stuff.

1382
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:14,080
More than ever.

1383
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,480
And I can't not kiss him.

1384
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,600
- I gotta go.
- What? Where are you going?

1385
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,240
Grand Central.

1386
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:27,840
<i>I'm gonna visit
my parents for a bit.</i>

1387
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:31,680
I have to sort things out.
Give me a hug, you.

1388
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,240
Have fun, okay?
And be careful.

1389
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,280
Okay.

1390
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,840
Bye.

1391
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,920
Gather round. Gather round.

1392
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,800
Of course.

1393
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,440
<i>You waitin' for a train?</i>

1394
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,960
I'm just saying if you are,
you might as well give up now.

1395
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,960
<i>- Jake, please.
- With your luck...</i>

1396
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,200
there's gonna be an announcement
that due to some freak accident
all trains have been canceled.

1397
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,480
<i>Then you're gonna go outside
and wait for the bus...</i>

1398
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:20,320
at which point the acid rain will commence-
perhaps even acid hail.

1399
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,960
Listen, Jake. I can't see you.
Okay? It's for your own good.

1400
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,240
Luck changes, Ashley.

1401
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,880
You know?

1402
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:32,320
You know, I- I kissed this amazing girl
at this masquerade party.

1403
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,720
No. Listen. I swear I'm not crazy, okay?
Our luck did get switched.

1404
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:39,840
And it still is.
Here. I dare you not to win.

1405
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,240
So you think meeting me
was unlucky?

1406
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:47,160
No. God, I'm lucky
to have met you.

1407
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:49,320
Okay?
But you deserve my luck.

1408
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:53,320
- You put it to better use than I ever did.
- Well, I don't want it anymore.

1409
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,760
- Are you crazy?
- I want you to have it.

1410
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:59,000
- No. Go away.
- It's been great...

1411
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:01,080
but I'll be fine without it.

1412
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,920
How do you know that?

1413
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,520
Because I'll have you in my life.

1414
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:12,920
A few bumps and bruises along the way
are a small price to pay.

1415
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,720
Tag. You're it.

1416
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,400
Oh, no. You're not
gettin' away with it that easy.

1417
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,400
- Oh, yeah?
- Not a chance.

1418
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,320
So now who?

1419
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,400
Who cares?

1420
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,080
Ew! Gross!

1421
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,920
<i>You leave a kid sitting in a limo
so you can make out?</i>

1422
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,920
You take me from a perfectly good party
with really cute rock stars...

1423
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,920
I pop a shoelace,
swallow my gum...

1424
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:09,240
<i>and now I'm stuck here
watching you two play tonsil hockey.</i>

1425
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,680
<i>- Good grief!
- Katy.</i>

1426
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,080
I am so glad you're here.

1427
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,440
Why are you guys
looking at me like this?

1428
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:23,600
Hold still. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

1429
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:26,840
Oh, I've been slimed!

1430
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,840
- Try this. You'll like it.
- It's fun.

1431
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,920
Cool.

1432
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:38,120
So, where were we just, like-

1433
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,440
- Ow.
- Ow.

1434
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,960
<i>Twenty-five bucks?
No freakin' way. I'm rich!</i>

1435
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,120
Oh, yeah! I'm rich!

1436
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:48,440
I'm taking the limo, okay?
This I gotta show Grams.

1437
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,280
I definitely hit the jackpot.

1438
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,800
<i>- Hey, Bernie!
- Thank you.</i>

1439
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,480
She deserves it.

1440
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,960
- Pizza?
- You're on.

1441
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:05,800
So, you think you can
adjust to life without luck?

1442
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:08,320
- Right now I've never felt luckier.
- Me too.

1443
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,880
- Do you believe in karma?
- Karma? Ash, you kidding me?

1444
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:14,880
One time I helped an old lady across the street.
Next day, I found a hundred-dollar bill.

1445
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,560
- Ash, that's luck.
- Karma.

1446
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,240
- It's luck.
- Karma, karma, karma.

1447
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,640
- Luck, luck, luck.
- It's karma.

1448
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,080
- It's luck.
- Get the door.

1449
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:25,160
Why, thank you.

1450
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,480
Hey.
Quarter.

1451
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:29,480
Hmm. Seems we still
have our luck.

1452
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,080
- Who cares?
- Absolutely.

1453
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:37,240
Hey! Shut the valve!
The pipe is broken.
