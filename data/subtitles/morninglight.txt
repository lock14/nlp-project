<i>The Pacific Ocean</i>
<i>between California and Hawaii</i>



<i>is the loneliest stretch</i>
<i>of water in the world.</i>



<i>A century ago, this was a
rarely-traveled route to paradise.</i>



<i>Now it's a race course for the
Indianapolis 500 of the open ocean.</i>



<i>An athletic test of speed and
endurance known as the Transpac.</i>



<i>Roy Disney knows</i>
<i>these waters well,</i>



<i>with two wins and two</i>
<i>record-breaking passages</i>



<i>over the course</i>
<i>of 16 Transpacs.</i>



<i>Now he's giving the next</i>
<i>generation an opportunity</i>



<i>by offering a bunch of rookies</i>
<i>the chance of a lifetime.</i>



<i>Thirty hopefuls were chosen to try
out for a new Transpac campaign</i>



<i>to be called the</i> Morning Light.



<i>A team of judges pushed them</i>
<i>hard for a week,</i>



<i>and by the end the 15 best</i>
<i>and brightest had emerged.</i>



We think you ought
to come to Hawaii.



- No way!
- Whoo!



<i>The 15 sailors will</i>
<i>train for six months</i>



<i>in the big winds</i>
<i>and big seas off Hawaii</i>



<i>before choosing a crew of 11 to race</i>
<i>from California to Diamond Head.</i>



<i>They will face more than 70 competitors,</i>



<i>and they'll try to match the legendary</i>
<i>crew of</i> Argonaut <i>from 1969,</i>



<i>another bunch of teenagers</i>
<i>who borrowed their dad's boat</i>



<i>and won it all.</i>



<i>This is the story of</i> Morning Light.



<i> This is gonna be my first story.</i>



<i>This is gonna be an epic story.</i>



<i>This is gonna probably</i>
<i>be my favorite story.</i>



<i>How it all began for Jesse Fielding</i>
<i>on the ocean, hopefully...</i>



<i>... uh, or it could just be a big flop.</i>



<i>Some of us are ready</i>
<i>for the full boot camp.</i>



<i>Others feel as though they may</i>
<i>be above the whole thing.</i>



<i>Everyone has to grow together</i>
<i>before this race begins.</i>



<i>The</i> Morning Light,
<i>although a true experience</i>



<i>for 15 young adults in Hawaii,</i>



<i>is also a very serious trial</i>
<i>to see if we can measure up.</i>



<i>We all wanted a chance to prove</i>
<i>ourselves, to race against the best.</i>



<i>Once the race starts in California, all</i>
<i>that matters is the Diamond Head buoy.</i>



- Hey, Roy.
- Hey, come on in.



- Welcome to Hawaii.
- Thank you.



First of all, there's 15 of you
here in the room,



and you know that only 11 of you
can go in the boat.



It's up to you to decide
who stays and who goes.



I just don't want you thinkin'
this is some kind of a game.



Right out the window there
is the Diamond Head buoy.



That's the finish line
of a 2,500-mile open-ocean race.



It's dangerous out there.



One mistake could really
put your lives at risk.



I always tell my crew, if you fall
overboard, consider it a death sentence.



But we're gonna train you
to have a shot at winning,



and we're gonna train you
to be safe out there.



I just hope you'll understand
it's really about the journey.



I think it's gonna change
every one of your lives.



There you go, guys.
There's your weapon.



Sweet.



Oh, wow. That is unreal!



- This is absurd!
- That's pretty sick.



That was a significant
event for the kids.



Kind of like when
you give a kid the car keys.



We gave them the keys to this, you know,
stripped-out racing machine.



- Oh, sweet!
- Unreal.



<i>Morning Light</i> is a TP52.



It's a 52-foot boat
that's very fast for its size.



It was originally designed to be
perfectly suited for the Transpac.



It's gonna get really cozy.



<i> I've never done an ocean race</i>
<i>before, so I don't know that feeling</i>



<i>of being absolutely alone</i>
<i>in the middle of the ocean.</i>



My parents are both doctors.
I always figured I would be a doctor,



but I get queasy
at the sight of blood, so...



<i> I just really have a fire</i>
<i>in my heart to go and sail,</i>



<i>and my parents support</i>
<i>my sailing a hundred percent.</i>



<i>I've spent my whole life</i>
<i>sailing in dinghies.</i>



<i>Really, it's all the same as a dinghy.</i>



<i>Just more purchases, more power, and</i>
<i>more systems to get around the power.</i>



<i>It was the first day out</i>
<i>and I was on the wheel.</i>



<i>I've been asked what it's like</i>
<i>to be a girl on this team.</i>



<i>I always say I have long hair and shave</i>
<i>my legs and that's the only difference.</i>



<i>But at the end of the day, sometimes</i>
<i>I feel like I have more to prove.</i>



<i>I have to really show that I'm worth it.</i>



<i>It's such a big boat I'm like, "I can't</i>
<i>steer on these waves, " but I can.</i>



Yeah! Yeah!



I would hope that I could be the skipper
or the helmsman on board.



I think that I may be
qualified enough to do that,



but whoever it is will have
earned the spot and deserve it.



It's gonna be intense.



<i>... Kalanianaole Highway from Kailua.</i>



<i>Waimanalo is clear across the Pali.</i>



<i>Kamehameha to Kahe Ko'olau.</i>
<i>Looking good on the Likelike.</i>



<i>Your morning traffic,</i>
<i>I'm Danielle Tucker,</i>



<i>Hawaiian 105,</i>
<i>your Hawaiian music station.</i>



I'm really cranky this morning.



Looks like you're struggling
to put the bread through.



Just so you know,
I like green eggs and ham.



OK, it's 6:30.



<i> My name is Graham</i>
<i>Brant-Zawadzki and this is my journal.</i>



<i>Our first week here</i>
<i>was brutal but awesome.</i>



Good. Nice and quick, nice and quick.



<i> Janelle, our trainer,</i>
<i>is rad, but she kicks our asses.</i>



And rest back on your right leg.
Overhead.



Stand on your right leg first.
Yeah, start on one side first.



OK. Quick on those toes.



Yeah.



<i> We've got to get in</i>
<i>better shape. This is a powerful boat</i>



<i>and sailing her is going</i>
<i>to be physically demanding.</i>



Whoo-hoo!



We went through an extensive
safety-at-sea course



that's never been done in this country.



<i> Most of what</i>
<i>we learned was really cool.</i>



<i>Either it was totally new information,</i>



<i>or it took things most of us thought</i>
<i>we knew into greater depth.</i>



Should I wait or do it ahead?



The Coast Guard was hugely supportive,



and they actually
took a rescue helicopter out



and sent in a rescue swimmer.



<i> Swimmer in the water.</i>
<i>Swimmer in the water.</i>



<i> The experience showed</i>
<i>me how intense the situation can get,</i>



<i>even in a totally controlled</i>
<i>environment and calm sea state.</i>



<i>I think the most important</i>
<i>thing I learned is how much</i>



<i>I never, ever wanna be stuck</i>
<i>in a life raft.</i>



<i> Robbie Kane, January tenth.</i>



<i>I used to think</i>
<i>I was invincible on a boat.</i>



<i>I soon realized how stupid</i>
<i>it is to think that way.</i>



<i>The boat I helped run lost the bowman</i>
<i>overboard in the Block Island race.</i>



<i>His name was Jamie Boeckel.</i>



<i>Realizing that a pro of that level</i>
<i>died that easily really scared me.</i>



<i>To lose a life because someone isn't</i>
<i>trained in safety is just pathetic.</i>



I think they will be
the safest team out there.



But any time you leave the dock
and you go to sea, there's danger.



But whatever happens,
you will finish that race.



<i> By day two</i>
<i>of the race, we'll be so far offshore</i>



<i>there's not a helicopter</i>
<i>in the world that can save us.</i>



<i>We are sailing by ourselves</i>
<i>across the Pacific Ocean.</i>



Everyone on this boat needs
to be the best that they can be.



This is no joke.



We have to... Whoa!



<i> My navigational background,</i>



<i>being out at sea in the Middle East</i>
<i>for three months,</i>



<i>I think that's gonna help.</i>



All right, I'll check SailMail,
come up, talk to you and Stan.



I'll be up in a bit.



<i> I'm putting my life on hold</i>
<i>for a year to do this.</i>



<i>Some people at the Merchant Marine</i>
<i>Academy are not too happy about that.</i>



I'm very, very, very lucky to be here.



Ready to jibe!
Jibing!



OK, main's out, main's out!



- Oh, no.
- It's not in yet.



Start pullin' big.
Big and hard.



- Ease back.
- Hold.



Uh, we might have to go
back on this one, boys.



Let's go back. Jibing back.



Sheet it in really hard
to bring the nose down.



<i> Jeremy is a badass.</i>



<i>The most knowledgeable sailor</i>
<i>I've ever sailed with.</i>



I'm Troll. Back when I was a little kid,
when I used to get salt in my hair...



I used to have long hair but it wouldn't
go down. It used to just go straight up.



OK, stand by.



<i> I was born into sailing.</i>



<i>My dad and my uncle were both</i>
<i>two-time Olympians.</i>



<i>My brother won three</i>
<i>world championships.</i>



Stacking the boat.



<i>So I have a lot of shoes to fill.</i>



Bring it on, guys.



When I get on a boat, I sort of...
I'm a bit of a control freak.



- Set that kite in.
- <i> Kit Will. Kit is rad.</i>



<i>He's really mellow, which I think</i>
<i>some people see as shy.</i>



<i>And I really hope that people will see</i>
<i>how valuable an asset he is to the team.</i>



Kit's invisible. You know,
he may be the first guy on the crew



that I would ask
to go on the ocean race,



'cause he has all the characteristics



- of a rock-solid offshore sailor.
- Trim.



<i> I was about ten, telling</i>
<i>my parents I really loved sailing.</i>



<i>It's how I related to the world, really,</i>



<i>feeling like you're connected</i>
<i>to the wind through the sails.</i>



There's something about
that connection that's amazing.



It's a ratchet.
That is the key to every winch.



<i> We're gonna be out there</i>
<i>for maybe ten days, on our own,</i>



<i>If something breaks, we have to fix it.</i>



And chances are something will break.



So remember, you've gotta go
around the Pacific high.



In the center of the Pacific
high there's no wind at all.



If you go into the high,
you're gonna stop.



It was an interesting group.
They had dinghy experience,



they're plenty smart.



That's correct.
That's your secondary fuel filter.



Right on. You got it.



But, in fact, none of this crew had,
you know, crossed an ocean.



- Whoo!
- Nice!



You get right, run your sail.



<i> Steve has enormous potential</i>
<i>as a sailor,</i>



<i>and the least amount of experience.</i>



<i> I don't think</i>
<i>I'm the least experienced.</i>



<i>Person who has been sailing</i>
<i>least is Graham, two years,</i>



<i>and I think I'm next in line</i>
<i>with three years.</i>



Do you know what it's like
to go in the water with your clothes on?



Well, that's what's gonna happen today.



You're gonna wear your shoes
and you're gonna wear what you have on.



So you're gonna swim down
to that end, come back here,



and you're gonna tread water
for five minutes.



<i> I had a hard time doing</i>
<i>the swim test back in California.</i>



<i>I was very nervous.</i>



- Keep coming.
- Almost there.



You're almost there.



You're almost there.



Help him, help him.



OK, guys. Out of the pool.
Nice job, everybody.



<i> It is really emotional for me.</i>
<i>My mother passed recently.</i>



<i>She passed in February this year.</i>



You're gonna go home
to Baltimore.



You're gonna learn how to swim



'cause when you get to Hawaii,
you better be ready...



Holy...



Oh, my God! Oh, my God.



- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. Very serious.



Oh, my God. Oh...



<i> First thing I thought of</i>
<i>was my mother.</i>



I don't know. I just know
she's proud of me, man.



Ah...



<i> You only get</i>
<i>certain opportunities in life,</i>



<i>and if you don't hop on 'em,</i>
<i>they'll go like that.</i>



<i>I live with my sister,</i>
<i>and my nieces and nephews.</i>



<i>I don't even grasp the whole concept of,</i>
<i>you know, like,</i>



<i>sailing through the ocean,</i>



<i>and I'm quite sure that</i>
<i>they probably don't either.</i>



<i>I think they do have, somewhat,</i>
<i>a fear for me, you know.</i>



Could be a chance that, you
know, I might not make it back.



So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna
sail upwind, we're gonna set a kite.



We're gonna have six people on deck. The
rest are gonna be down in your bunks,



and we're gonna simulate
a man overboard with a kite up.



Steve's gonna jump over the side.
He very nicely volunteered.



<i> January 21st.</i>
<i>I think the best way to overcome fear</i>



<i>is to face it head-on.</i>



Anytime, Steve.



Go, buddy.



- Help!
- Man overboard!



Pointing, pointing.
Got him. Got him.



Pull him along, right?
I got him.



- Don't look back.
- Still have him?



<i> You hit the water,</i>
<i>it takes five seconds to come up.</i>



<i>Then you see the boat,</i>
<i>and it's like a half a mile away.</i>



OK, kite down.



<i> In good breeze,</i>
<i>every second counts,</i>



<i>especially when you're hauling ass</i>
<i>doing 18 knots with the kite up.</i>



Wait. What are you doing?



<i> It's not like you can</i>
<i>pull the hand brake</i>



<i>and spin the boat on a dime.</i>



OK, gotcha.



Hold on, hold on.
You need...



Come on, guys. Main in.



- He's out of sight.
- I got ya. He's right here.



Come on. Turn!



Here it comes!



All right, two big guys,
we're gonna pick him up.



Off our bow.



- Throw him a line!
- Gotta be long.



- Welcome back, man.
- Good job!



Yeah!



<i> All I remember</i>



<i>is feeling a sense of</i>
<i>accomplishment as a group</i>



<i>that we got Steve back on that boat,</i>



<i>and that he had conquered</i>
<i>a big hurdle in his life.</i>



<i>In a real race,</i>
<i>at night, in bad weather,</i>



<i>that training exercise</i>
<i>will always be in the back of my head.</i>



I thought we got back there
pretty quickly.



Definitely, like,
you realize how quickly



you get away from somebody
with a chute up.



So, you were pointin' at the ring,
right? But she still couldn't see me?



I mean, I could see a little bit
of fleck on the top of a wave.



But you went out of sight,



- I wanna say a minute. Not even.
- Wow.



<i> We're a team of 15.</i>
<i>Every single person deserves to race.</i>



<i>We can't all go. Only 11.</i>



<i> We as a team will be picking</i>
<i>the four who stay behind.</i>



<i>As the youngest team member, this has</i>
<i>been extremely nerve-racking for me.</i>



Bring me back in, Chris.



Guys, I'd like to practice
some jibes, if we got the time.



- Let's pre-check.
- We're gonna go real slow.



All right, clear to jibe.
Jibing.



<i> Jibes are the turns that you</i>
<i>have to do in order to get downwind,</i>



<i>because the boat can't sail</i>
<i>directly downwind.</i>



<i>So instead you sail</i>
<i>40 degrees one way,</i>



<i>turn, or you jibe, and then you sail 40</i>
<i>degrees off the wind the other way.</i>



<i>Tacks are similar.</i>



<i>Tacks are the turns that you have to do</i>
<i>when you're going upwind.</i>



OK, we're sailing again.



Sailing's always been
a complex sport. It's not that simple.



I mean, you could
stay in it for a lifetime



and never have it completely
figured out or perfected.



What is that?
Push it a little!



Little bit too wimpy.



<i>P.S., whoever said big boats are</i>



<i>just like dinghies is full of it.</i>



<i>Screwups, kites in the water,</i>
<i>kites exploding.</i>



<i>We need to sort</i>
<i>these issues out ourselves</i>



<i>and learn to deal with them</i>
<i>before this race begins.</i>



- Oops!
- Don't tear it!



Without a team being totally focused
in one positive direction,



you're not gonna be successful.



First aid kit? Stocked.



Paper towels? Check.
Toilet paper? Check.



Coffee? Check. Soap?



Just make darn sure
we've got enough life jackets.



We wanted the kids to be very familiar
with finishing a Transpac race.



So we had them sail over to Molokai,



down the Molokai Channel
and then come into Diamond Head.



OK. Let's go. You guys ready?



We had sent them off overnight
by themselves completely.



Let's finish this race up
and get outta here!



<i> My first overnight.</i>



<i>It was scary, wet, there was</i>
<i>a lot of awkward flailing,</i>



<i>and I passed out</i>
<i>before we finished.</i>



<i>A few other kids just</i>
<i>puked the whole time.</i>



<i>That trip seriously</i>
<i>took it out of the whole team,</i>



<i>and that was just</i>
<i>over 24 hours.</i>



<i>We were sloppy</i>
<i>and out of shape.</i>



<i> They'd show up with the boat</i>
<i>trashed. You know, everything a mess.</i>



They hadn't really taken on, you know,
this offshore seamanship.



And they weren't
in any kind of condition



to be able to continue sailing
the way you have to



when you cross an ocean.



<i> At the current pace</i>
<i>we will not be ready.</i>



<i>We're beginning to realize</i>
<i>the need to push ourselves harder.</i>



If we're gonna have these coaches,
let's not waste them.



Let's use them to their full...



Even if you think it's obvious.



It could be something
that's obvious, but...



...half of us wouldn't know,
the people that do don't care.



The best thing is...



<i> Everything hinges</i>
<i>on the skipper and the leader.</i>



<i>On an hourly basis, they will decide</i>
<i>our fate on the</i> Morning Light.



I want to say one thing for, um, Genny.



'Cause there's been a lot of times
where we've been hanging out as a group,



and if Genny says,
"Hey, we need to be there now,"



everyone's like, picks up
their bags and we go.



Her organization definitely keeps us all
together. I definitely agree with that.



<i> The way to get good</i>
<i>at making those decisions</i>



<i>is to be placed in them.</i>



Who's gonna go in to shore?
Are we ready?



Yeah. I got it blowing.
Blow it! Yeah!



Mike Sanderson, who just won
the around-the-world race,



he came in for a week to train the kids.



<i> The second that Moose</i>
<i>stepped on the boat,</i>



<i>we realized how unprepared we were,</i>



<i>how much we had to learn,</i>
<i>and how much he could teach us.</i>



Faster, faster, faster,
faster, faster. Let it go.



They're not rock stars yet. You know,
they're not professional sailors.



Pull back.



<i> We need to prove to</i>
<i>ourselves that we can sail this boat.</i>



You're controlling the thing.
You call, all right?



One minute, Towiller,
keep talking to me.



Yeah, and smoke it. Smoke it.



Nice one.
Basic dilemma. Yeah, baby.



Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming,
keep coming, keep coming.



Go, Jeremy.



<i> I had never been</i>
<i>part of a team</i>



<i>that wants it more than</i> Morning Light.



<i>I've raced in five countries,</i>
<i>endless practices on all types of boats</i>



<i>and this was my favorite day</i>
<i>of sailing I've ever had.</i>



<i> I wish, at least,</i>
<i>it was a good story.</i>



<i>I wish I could say I'd jumped</i>
<i>off a cliff into the shallows</i>



<i>or was attacked by a shark</i>
<i>while kite-surfing.</i>



<i>Something really fun and off-the-wall.</i>



She didn't take our advice. She went off
snowboarding between sessions.



I said, "You sure
you wanna do that, Genny?"



And she said, "Oh, don't worry,
Robbie. I'll be fine."



<i> I sat down and cried.</i>



<i>All I knew was that it hurt,</i>



<i>and the major implications</i>
<i>of having broken myself.</i>



We wanted the kids
to go offshore for three days.



Then they would meet us in Hilo.



She wanted to participate
a lot more than we allowed her to.



In fact, we didn't allow her
to do anything.



Good luck!



<i> Disappointment.</i>



<i>Frustration. Loneliness.</i>



- Bye, guys!
- Bye!



<i> We are now at the stage where</i>
<i>we can sail 24-hour overnight sprints.</i>



<i>However, our race</i>
<i>can be up to ten days long.</i>



<i>The Hilo trip will help us</i>
<i>get into a rhythm</i>



<i>of racing at sea</i>
<i>for several days at a time.</i>



<i> Everyone gets seasick.</i>



<i>I don't care if you've sailed</i>
<i>around the world, everyone does.</i>



<i>You're just so uncomfortable.</i>
<i>Your bones ache, you can't think,</i>



<i>you wanna just die.</i>



Ah!



I'm gonna give you...



<i> Down below it's hot,</i>



<i>it's humid, it's wet, it smells.</i>



<i>For a navigator who's trying</i>
<i>to stare at a computer,</i>



<i>and you're banging in the waves,</i>



<i>I don't care how tough you are,</i>
<i>you're gonna get sick.</i>



<i> We kept the boat</i>
<i>in solid condition</i>



<i>throughout three days</i>
<i>of extreme upwind sailing.</i>



<i>My stress level was at an all-time high.</i>



It sucks being here!



<i> They showed up in Hilo</i>
<i>after an absolutely heinous trip.</i>



And beating in 30 to 40 knots
in horrible seas.



<i>Oh, and the boat's in perfect shape.</i>
<i>Everything's neat as a pin.</i>



Hey, Genny.



- You guys miss me?
- Mm-hmm.



It was probably good
you didn't come, on a serious note.



It was... it was rough.



- Did people fall over?
- A lot of people yakked.



Never going downwind.



<i>My hands are swollen and sore.</i>



<i>My fingers are bent in</i>
<i>from holding on to sheets for so long.</i>



<i>My legs are weak,</i>
<i>and my cuts are infected.</i>



I was like, "This is
ridiculous. Not doing anything..."



<i> When I landed in Hilo,</i>
<i>I felt like I'd climbed a mountain</i>



<i>or broke through a wall.</i>



<i> The team's progressing,</i>
<i>and I'm just stagnant.</i>



<i> The way back from Hilo</i>
<i>is an opportunity for downwind sailing.</i>



<i>It'll be a good test</i>
<i>because the Transpac is all downwind.</i>



It was perfect conditions.
It was all night long.



You know, hairball sailing
the whole way. You know, 30, 35 knots.



And it was just wild.



It was perfect practice
for the kids.



We took 'em just down
the north side of Molokai



and on in through the Molokai Channel,



just like the finish for the Transpac.



<i> I know I've probably ruined</i>
<i>my chances of being the skipper.</i>



<i>Now I just have to hope</i>
<i>I'll still make the race.</i>



<i> Genny's a great sailor</i>
<i>and won't have any trouble</i>



<i>getting back to sailing the boat</i>
<i>when she recovers.</i>



<i>I don't think she should be punished,</i>



<i>because having to miss out</i>
<i>on all the sailing this session</i>



<i>is way more punishment</i>
<i>than anyone deserves.</i>



<i>So, yeah, it sucks all around.</i>



By the end of it, the kids
were pretty comfortable



with sailing their boat
in a ton of breeze, and it was clear



that they were gonna
come into it saying, "Bring it on."



<i>There was one thing</i>
<i>they weren't quite ready for:</i>



<i>Picking the 11</i>
<i>who would sail the race.</i>



I just think that we should
maybe see who wants to be a skipper,



as opposed to throwing everybody out
and having a random discussion.



Maybe just put your hand up if you want
to be a skipper, I don't know.



Raise your hand
if you wanna be a skipper.



<i> The skipper is the ultimate</i>
<i>leader, the final decision maker,</i>



<i>the top in the hierarchy of control.</i>



Uh, to start off, just with the past
few passages, um...



Just Jeremy, uh, the way he puts
everything, is very professional.



So Jeremy is definitely my vote.



I have complete confidence
in Jeremy as the skipper.



Troll, hands down.



Yeah, Troll.
Troll, yeah.



Aussie's got my vote, too.



Uh, Troll...



I definitely want you to be the skipper



because the crap you say
when...... goes wrong



is just so funny.



It's funny. So, I mean, I think, like...



<i> I didn't expect</i>
<i>the decision to be unanimous.</i>



I'm just gonna say it.
I love sailing with all of you guys.



I-I respect every one of you so much.



And it would be a huge honor...



<i> I feel like, when the decision</i>
<i>was made, I aged ten years.</i>



<i> We had lived, sailed,</i>
<i>and partied together for four months.</i>



<i>That made this process that much harder.</i>



<i> After Jeremy</i>
<i>was selected as the skipper,</i>



<i>he elected to consult with Piet.</i>



So here's the first question.



<i> The two of them</i>
<i>began bringing in</i>



<i>chosen team members one by one.</i>



<i>I can't describe how stressful it was.</i>



Two watch captains
would be you and Schubert.



<i>Underneath the skipper</i>
<i>are the watch captains.</i>



<i>They are essentially</i>
<i>the skipper of their watch.</i>



<i>Not only was I not a key player,</i>



<i>I was now sitting, sweating,</i>



<i>hoping just to still make the team.</i>



<i> Every person</i>
<i>on this team deserves to race.</i>



<i>Even if I am lucky enough</i>
<i>to actually go on the race,</i>



<i>it would be hard for me to know</i>
<i>that I'd be taking the place</i>



<i>of someone else</i>
<i>who absolutely deserved to go.</i>



Graham doesn't have
a lot of hours sailing.



If we choose him, we'll have to put
a lot of hours into him.



Mm-hmm.



Right, Robbie knows his bow team.



He knows who he wants to get backed up.
We need him in here for this decision.



How long do you
think this is gonna take tonight?



- Hours.
- When did we start?



- I think it's going quick.
- Yeah.



- Seven-thirty-ish?
- It's 9:10 now.



Turtle, you've gotta be here
because you...



That's... It's the front of your boat
and we gotta know...



<i>Robbie Kane was next to go in,</i>
<i>and then Jesse made it.</i>



We, uh... We want you on the boat
for the Transpac.



- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, dude.



I'm focused in, man.



<i> Towiller got called in,</i>
<i>and that left four spots,</i>



<i>with eight of us still waiting.</i>



We think
you got a great personality.



We think you're very focused.



And you can drive a boat very nicely.



Thanks.



We've kept her
out of here for a reason.



We can't hold her back.
She's on our boat.



Come on, you injured soldier.



<i> The relief on my face</i>
<i>must have been palpable.</i>



<i>They still wanted me.</i>



We expect you to heal,
not break any more arms.



- No more skiing, snowboarding.
- No more skiing.



<i>Chris Welch followed Genny.</i>



Awesome. I'm in.



Sign me up!



- Do you want to... Yeah?
- Oh, yeah! Yeah!



<i>And finally Branning was called in.</i>



- How is it out there?
- Quiet.



<i> Five of us were left in</i>
<i>the kitchen waiting for one more spot.</i>



OK, guys, everyone else.
OK, guys.



So, we brought you all in.



At the end of the day,
we all are the...



Still the team, like I said.
But, um...



For this race, uh,
w-we want to take Graham on the boat



just because we think, uh,
his strengths that offer us



match what we're missing on the boat.



Um, I think it's awesome



that Graham has been sailing for,
like... two years, right?



And, like, to see him,
like, just skyrocket,



he'd be on this level...
I think that's really awesome



that you guys can see his improvement.



<i> It's almost impossible</i>
<i>to explain how unhappy I was.</i>



<i>I wanted to call a cab,</i>
<i>go to the airport,</i>



<i>fly standby out of that place.</i>



If I didn't think, like, the weight
would slow us down that much,



I'd throw another life raft on the boat.



But you know this was gonna happen
since the start.



<i> I didn't understand</i>
<i>Jeremy's choice at the time.</i>



<i>I don't think I ever will.</i>



OK, here's our wave.
Easing into it!



Didn't see that comin'.



Get the spinnaker ready!



<i> Eleven spots on the boat</i>
<i>for the race.</i>



<i>The other four will be alternates.</i>



<i>They have to be ready to go</i>
<i>in case someone gets hurt.</i>



<i> The next day, I went out</i>
<i>on the water with something to prove.</i>



OK, transfer!



<i> And I did some of</i>
<i>the best sailing that day.</i>



<i>Probably the best sailing</i>
<i>of my entire life.</i>



Ooh! Nice one, guys.



Here we go.



Help me, now.



Kit is just the sort of person
you want offshore.



You know, eyes open, mouth shut,



and totally responsible and committed.



And I was astonished when he wasn't
selected by the kids for their team.



<i> Kit's like that silent guy</i>
<i>on the boat.</i>



<i>You never really notice him</i>
<i>until you're forced to.</i>



<i>He never has a problem.</i>
<i>He does his job.</i>



<i>He does it so efficiently,</i>
<i>you don't notice him.</i>



<i>So he's the type of guy</i>
<i>who can just slip through.</i>



- Ready on take-in.
- Clear on the halyard! Jibe!



<i> Graham's team spirit</i>
<i>is just incredible.</i>



<i>It's so vital to the team.</i>



<i> We have the team</i>
<i>we are going to have.</i>



<i>And although it is not perfect,</i>
<i>nothing ever is in this world.</i>



Good jibe, guys! Good jibe on
the main. Good jibe on the sheet.



Hook down.



<i>After four months in Hawaii,</i>



<i>we packed up the boat</i>
<i>and headed back to the mainland.</i>



<i> By the time the boat was</i>
<i>set up in California, my cast was off.</i>



<i>My arm was a little weak,</i>
<i>but I was ready to go.</i>



Bear food.



There's another TP52,



brand-new boat, <i>Samba Pa Ti.</i>



It's a team of very,
very highly trained professionals.



<i>Samba's</i> gonna be
their toughest competition.



<i> They've sailed</i>
<i>more miles than I have on my used car.</i>



<i>That's a lot of miles.</i>



These boats are powerful.
They're only 52 feet long,



but they go a lot faster than the sleds



and the maxi boats of the '70s or '80s.



Uh, we feel very confident in the ocean.



That's where we...
a lot of us grew up.



Samba <i>represents a lot</i>
<i>of veteran ocean-racing experience.</i>



<i>We'll have to navigate better,</i>
<i>and we'll have to sail the boat harder.</i>



If it's breezy,
and if you have big seas,



you're gonna have to be a crew that, uh,
can handle a boat in the open ocean.



And for inexperienced people,
that's a big challenge.



<i> Just days before the race,</i>
<i>we got a surprise.</i>



Hey, BZ, you got a minute?



<i> I didn't know if I should</i>
<i>do it, or how I should do it.</i>



<i>It was the hardest thing</i>
<i>I've ever had to do in my life.</i>



OK, guys, pretty much there's just been
some thoughts going through my head.



You know, you knew when you,
uh, made me skipper,



if I see a way to get there
any faster or...



...you know...



So I've, uh, made a change to the crew.



And, um, BZ's now...



Uh, now alternate.



And, uh, Kit's gonna be
coming on the boat.



It's... It's, uh... I don't know,
it's pretty tough.



I just want to say I think
it's the right thing to do.



I think Kit deserved it.
And he's an awesome sailor, so...



You guys are better off with him.



That was why we chose you, man.



You're an amazing team player.



We're gonna miss you.



It's like breaking up
with your girlfriend.



I know. I'm waiting for
the slap...



Graham's a bit more tasteful
than the girls I go out with.



That's for sure.



<i> We had come to the end</i>
<i>of a long, intense six months.</i>



<i>The night before the race,</i>
<i>we got a really nice surprise.</i>



Dim the lights.



- Very cool.
- That's awesome.



<i> I think everyone was on</i>
<i>edge in terms of anticipation.</i>



<i>There was a lot</i>
<i>of energy in the room.</i>



Oh, my God!



Ah!



Yeah!



<i> Mark,</i>
<i>we're so very, very proud of you.</i>



<i>We always knew that you would be</i>
<i>sailing home one day.</i>



<i>Good luck, and enjoy the ride.</i>



<i>Genny girl, there have been Tullochs</i>
<i>on the Pacific Ocean before.</i>



<i>Your grandfather sailed</i>
<i>square riggers there</i>



<i>more than 150 years ago.</i>



<i>And now it's another Tulloch crossing</i>
<i>the Pacific Ocean, this time on a race.</i>



<i>We hope you have fun.</i>
<i>We hope you make lots of friends.</i>



<i>And make sure you don't hit</i>
<i>any whales on the way over.</i>



<i>Take care and good luck.</i>



<i> Everyone</i>
<i>was happy to hear from their families.</i>



- <i> Hi, Christopher.</i>
- Oh, Mom.



<i>I'm very happy</i>
<i>and excited for you...</i>



<i>They are the root of who we are.</i>



<i>We love you from</i>
<i>the bottom of our hearts.</i>



<i>And, as your father would say,</i>



<i>sail fast and stay on course.</i>



<i>Well, Robbie,</i>
<i>beyond "good luck," be careful.</i>



<i>Uh, like any parent, re...</i>
<i>be real careful.</i>



<i> There was a common</i>
<i>message of being safe, sailing fast,</i>



<i>and giving it all we can.</i>



<i>Enjoy every minute of it.</i>



<i>And, uh, just give 'em hell.</i>



<i>Jesse MacGowan Baker</i>
<i>Ferguson Fielding... </i>



<i>... you and your mom were so close,</i>
<i>you shared a birthday.</i>



<i>And you had one more birthday...</i>



<i> It was reassuring.</i>
<i>But I don't need a reminder</i>



<i>that my mom is with me on a daily basis.</i>



<i>She wrote to you:</i>



<i>"Think you can, believe you can,</i>



<i>and you will.</i>



<i>Your mother. September '97. "



<i> I don't normally like to</i>
<i>share that side with people...</i>



<i>... but in this case it felt right.</i>



<i>Good luck, Jesse.</i>
<i>Uh, I hope you have a good time</i>



<i>and that you ask 'em</i>
<i>if I should get a haircut.</i>



<i>I'll see you when you get there.</i>



<i>Hope you have some good stories.</i>
<i>Uh... good luck.</i>



<i>Now leaving</i>
<i>Rainbow Harbor:</i> Skylark,



<i>the Santa Cruz 70 out of</i>
<i>Newport Beach, California.</i>



<i>Godspeed,</i> Skylark.
<i>And aloha!</i>



<i>That dock was crawling with guys</i>
<i>we've all read about or heard about.</i>



<i>It's like getting</i>
<i>to hit a bucket of balls</i>



<i>on the same driving range</i>
<i>as Tiger Woods.</i>



<i>We've had our sights set</i>
<i>on trying to beat</i> Samba.



<i>But we are the underdogs.</i>



<i> Next boat leaving,</i>
Samba Pa Ti.



<i> I'm sick of practicing</i>
<i>and preparing. I'm chomping at the bit.</i>



<i>Hawaii's closer than we think,</i>
<i>so it'll be important</i>



<i>to push 100 percent all the time.</i>



OK, Chris.
Thanks for your help.



- We'll wait for you.
- Can I have a hug?



- Ahh!
- Bring it in.



All right.



Let's do this.



Next up, a boat you've been
reading about just a little bit,



<i>Morning Light!</i>



Go! Yay!



Godspeed, <i>Morning Light.</i>
And aloha!



<i> It's pretty powerful</i>
<i>to realize this boat</i>



<i>is the center of the earth</i>
<i>for us, and now this is home.</i>



<i>These, uh, crew members, they're</i>
<i>everything, you know. Everything.</i>



<i> Attention, Transpac racers.</i>



- <i>Five minutes to the start.</i>
- Got it. Five minutes.



OK, why don't you go down
below. Kit, you're up.



Want me to grind?
You want me to grind?



- Nah.
- All right.



- How long?
- Two-twenty.



- One-twenty.
- <i> Twenty seconds to P flag down.</i>



Are we starting on port?



One minute!



- Don't worry, guys.
- Forty seconds.



A little pressure here.
A little pressure.



Twenty-five seconds.



Holding on the line.



- Get it set.
- Line, Robbie!



- Ten!
- <i> Nine.</i>



- Get it up now.
- Eight, seven, six...



...five...
- <i>... four...</i>



...three, two, one!



<i> Now.</i>



Medium down.



- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!



Hey! Yes!



I remember it
being very adventurous,



- the first time I crossed an ocean.
- Come on, Towiller.



These guys, they're getting to grow
and learn at a very similar age group.



That's a fantastic opportunity,
and I wish something like this



had popped up for me when I was 21.



- Well, here we are at Transpac 2007.
- Yeah!



Upwind.
Did a few sail changes.



Now I'm ready to, uh, set a kite,
and take my shirt off, and go downwind.



I had to start the race
down below. It was so light.



I started thinking,
"I'm already missing the small things:



Cheese pizza, HBO,



that beautiful woman
from Gladstone's."



The whole mindset
in offshore sailing



is you start to find
what your limits are.



How far can you push yourself,



how many hours can you
work without rest,



how long can you go without food?



And mentally you have the ability
to set your mind on infinity.



That's a winning combination.



<i> No family and friends</i>
<i>from back home.</i>



- <i> No Starbucks.</i>
- <i> No music.</i>



- <i> No movies.</i>
- <i> No surfing.</i>



<i>All that matters is</i>
<i>the Diamond Head buoy.</i>



lt... It feels amazing
to be on this boat.



Being on a crew with a bunch of young
kids is kinda the coolest thing,



'cause you really build a team



and not just sail with a bunch of guys



who are telling you
what to do all the time,



but you all kind of feel
like you're part of it



and feel like we have a shot
at doing really well in this race.



Piet and Jeremy and I, we're at a very
big decision-making point right now,



we need to choose between
the northern and southern route.



There's no middle-of-the-road route.



'Cause we have a local
weak high-pressure



that has been living in the middle of
the wing existing tracks for Transpac.



The history of the race
has always been the team



that makes that choice
at the right time,



whether it's to go south, to go north.



It's a defining moment, and it's
one of those moments you back up,



and that's where
the race is won and lost.



What I'm saying is,
you know, if we're...



If we're gonna be in the synoptic,
we're on the southern route...



They really gotta make sure
that they stay in the pack,



don't make some dumb mistake



which suddenly drops them
a few miles behind,



and then they're on the back foot.



They don't need to be leading,
they just need to be in the hunt.



Everything we've always learned and
talked about is not to get that close.



Jeremy, what do you think?



South.



We just wanna stay away
from this, uh, high.



Big fish last night
jumped out of the water,



- hit the sail right there.
- Hit the sail, I know.



What about that whale?
That was a whale, wasn't it?



I thought so.



Ten feet from our boat.
Trim on.



Trim? Trim?



Trim.



You gotta use
your big girl voice.



Hold there.



It's the first morning,
the sun just came up.



At sunset last night
we could see ten, 15 boats,



and now we've got no one in sight.



Position report comes out
in a little while,



we'll see how we're doing
against our competitors.



<i>Alaska Eagle, Alaska Eagle,</i>



this is <i>Morning Light</i> Whiskey Delta
Delta five one seven eight.



Morning Light, <i>have you loud</i>
<i>and clear. Welcome and good morning.</i>



<i>Your position.</i>



Thirty-two one-nine north.



One-one-nine five-six west.



Morning Light,
<i>thank you very much.</i>



Where are they?



<i>Samba Pa Ti's</i>
range and bearing.



Range: 20 miles.
Bearing: 223.



So they're going up.



Directly ahead of us,
20 miles. Yeah.



- They're 19 miles ahead.
- Yeah.



We need to know who's goin'
north and who's goin' south.



You see what's for dinner?



Eleven forty-one on Monday,



and, uh, that means lunchtime.



So, the first gourmet meal



of this big event



will be, uh,
beef stroganoff with noodles.



My favorite.



This southerly route
doesn't look so good. It's nine knots.



I wanna go fast.
That's 20 knots up there right now.



- What, going north?
- Going more northerly, yeah.



It's like taking
a right turn right now.



It's all in or nothing, man.



Figure I could just ask right now.



I mean, it's been an hour
since we've been...



Started this discussion,
you know.



We haven't heard from them
what we should be doing.



I think I should just start smashing
my foot on the deck.



- That's not... Uh, yeah.
- No, they hate that.



Yeah.



- What do you guys think?
- If we do this,



this is the whole race right here.



Here we go, guys.
Let's go!



Are we basically deciding
to go north now, or...



- Yeah.
- Yeah.



What's the heading? 245?



Hey, lads!
We're going north.



- Ease the sheets!
- Full upwind.



North. Full upwind.



This is a slow way
to go across the Pacific, huh?



Are we going to Alaska?



About 12 hours later,
the kids changed their mind



and they headed north again.



What it told me was that, you know,
there was somebody home on the boat.



They were thinking, they were making
decisions, they were doing stuff.



Then they headed north again.



You know what I just thought
of, but I don't know why?



You know why the Chevy Nova
didn't work in Mexico?



Yeah. All right.



'Cause <i>"no va"</i>
means, like, "no go."



Why'd you buy a car
called the "no go"?



Freakin' dying. Quickly.



No way.
This wind's just gonna die.



"Graham,
the race has been slow.



I'm sure you're aware of this.



The brain trust has just indicated
that the next 18 hours or so



may dictate the entire
outcome of the race.



I hope your fingers are crossed
and you're following along at home



in Hawaii or wherever you are
at this present point in time.



My feet are just starting to smell.



I'm using precious off-watch time
to communicate with you.



I guess that's all for now.



Adios from the nerve center.
Talk to you later."



This is bad.
Real bad.



You think this is the first
time this has happened in the Transpac?



It'll be one that
they're gonna remember,



- and Stan's gonna harken back to.
- Yeah, this is crazy.



Any way you approach this race,
you have to slice through that.



That turn's gonna cost us.



No use talking about it now.



Oh, this is painful
circumstances right now.



We've got our opponents
out to the south of us



who are screaming along with a kite.



Guys out to the north
of us are in more breeze.



This is frustrating.



We took a gamble.



It was a big move at the time.



Now we're fighting for the past two days
to get out of it.



And we should've pretended
we were on train tracks



and just trusted it.
Didn't look this light.



But it is, and here we are.
Can't escape it now.



- We should've known better.
- Yeah.



We can second-guess
ourselves all the way home.



We'll be lucky to make it
to Hawaii in ten days, now.



I got a question for ya.



- Yeah?
- Are we effed?



- Huh?
- Are we effed?



- We don't think so. Yeah.
- Really?



You think... you think
that we can reel in <i>Samba?</i>



Uh, we'll see.



We're not, like,
out in the middle of nowhere?



- No, we're not.
- You sure?



Big wind shift
here, guys.



Come on.
Let's do this.



OK, tacking the boat.



Going to Hawaii.



Finally!



We're almost
pointing at the mark.



Guys, when you have dinner,
clean your stuff, please.



- Oh! Oh-ho!
- Whoo!



It's Wednesday morning.



Uh, just got done doin' the roll call.



Not to be, like, uh, Debbie Downer,



I thought we were gonna be smoked
after yesterday.



Did you hear from Branning,
the position report?



- Brought some standings.
- Eh.



We're first in division, 21 st in fleet.



And <i>Samba's,</i> uh, second in division,
22nd in fleet.



We have 1,742 miles to go,



and they got 1,742 miles to go.



Did anybody see that comin'?



Branning, you the man.



Hi.



Hi.



Twelve hours ago we were all wrecked.



Branning was ready to quit
sailing altogether.



Very stressful.
Think I lost some hair.



It was pretty miserable.



We were over on port deck
going very slow.



Now we've, uh, tacked over
onto starboard,



and blue sky, it's beautiful.



Bit of a difference.
Sailing pretty good today.



Emotional roller coaster through
and through, this bloody race.



Hey, Towiller.
We need you on deck, mate.



- Coming.
- And you, too, Branning.



- OK, you guys ready?
- Yeah. Ready in the pit.



Hoist when ready, guys.



- Bring it over.
- Go for it, go, go, go!



Hold there, Towiller.



Ease. Ease, Towill.



It's startin' to feel more
what I pictured Transpac to be like.



We're going to, going to Hawaii,
and we're back in the game.



We're gonna need
another human up here.



- ... more brace?
- More brace.



Piet, where's our <i>Morning Light</i>
logo on this kite?



Get Charlie up.
Isn't he in charge of sails?



The first kite we hoist in the Transpac
doesn't even have one.



<i> "Charles.</i>
<i>Thanks for the contact.</i>



<i>Hawaii is fun.</i>



<i>The Red Sox just won the World Series.</i>



<i>And tell Welchy</i>
<i>the stock market burned down.</i>



<i>I'm sorry, but there are</i>
<i>no more stocks. Period.</i>



<i>Looks like you guys are going balls-out</i>
<i>on your route so far.</i>



<i>Hope you're rationing.</i>



<i>Everyone's either gonna say you're</i>
<i>brilliant or redheaded.</i>



<i>But tell Fancypants not to worry.</i>



<i>Statistics show that</i>
<i>30 percent of redheads..."</i>



We had a beautiful sunset tonight.



If you look over here,
you can see the-the moon, um,



just glistening at the top of the...



Top of the clouds as it's setting,



and we've just got the slightest
little crescent new moon



and it's absolutely beautiful.



It's making a little spotlight
down on the water and...



Beautiful stuff out here, man.



I just got an e-mail
from Graham. He wrote back.



Our race so far,
he wishes he was with us.



Clearly he's checking the grids, not
that he knows exactly what they mean.



He's into it and,
based on our track,



people are gonna either think we're
brilliant or a bunch of redheads.



But, redheads tend to...



Thirty percent of all redheads
turn out to live...



...healthy, productive lives
or something.



- Yes.
- But, yeah, he seems in good spirits.



- Trim up.
- Good.



That's good.
That's really good.



Whoo! It's a scorcher!



It's gonna be a "Triple-H" day:
hazy, hot, and humid.



I gotta take a shower...
I gotta do some sort of bathing today.



Today was the first day
where it's really hot.



Woke up and it was sweaty and nasty
down below, which is not very fun.



We share bunks downstairs,



so your person opposite you
gets a little too smelly,



then, you know, it's miserable.



<i>Big Michiganders Gone Wild.</i>



I think a little shower,
brushing your teeth,



besides the health part of it,
just kinda keeps you going.



I mean, it's a... freshens you up.



Today was awesome. I got a shower,
I got to shave...



Got a hot date tonight, Genny?



I groomed myself
while all the boys watched.



No, I'm just kidding. Um, but it was
sweet to finally get a shower today.



And then, obviously, all the...
all the... Trim.



Um, I feel like



we're all in a pretty good mood
and we're all clean and happy.



Our competition, <i>Samba,</i>
is, uh, right above us,



so there's a lot of pressure
on the bow team at nighttime.



Tonight's gonna be a big opportunity
for either one of us to push away.



Nighttime racing is, uh,
where you can really make huge gains.



And it's hard to see your competitors.



They can, uh, pull a maneuver
without you seeing.



Last night was our first night
with the spinnaker, and it feels off.



We just need to kinda get with it.
Everyone was running around



like chickens with their heads
cut off, including myself.



If we go to sleep for two hours
we could lose seven miles like that.



These guys on <i>Samba,</i>
they're all fantastic sailors.



And, you know, we're all
really new to it, I guess.



And we've gotta really make sure that
we, you know, try and keep our edge.



Who knows?
You might see us tonight



jibing a couple of times
on random shifts,



just to get away
from these guys to windward



and catch 'em
with their pants down.



I like where your head's at.



Yeah.



This is pretty much, I guess,



as about as far away from land
as you can get anywhere on the planet,



- where we are right now.
- Yeah. Halfway point.



Pretty amazing, isn't it?



<i>Samba Pa Ti,</i> we just saw. We can see
their running lights right over there.



They're behind us and going south.



So it's Day Six,
we just saw <i>Samba,</i>



and we're less than
a mile away from them.



<i>Samba's</i> come astern of us
and jibed right on our line.



Trim up.



The pressure's really been up.



The... the intensity
on the boat is super high.



We're just pushing, pushing,
pushing all the time.



Hold.



Trim up.
Big trim, big trim.



Nice.



I can't believe
that boat's right there.



How close do you think they are?



Quarter of a mile?
Not even 200 yards?



Nice to have someone
right there to push you.



Just think, we're making 'em
work for their money today.



- Yup.
- Yeah.



Don't stop.



Ooh. Bolt.



It's a thousand miles
into the race.



<i>Samba's</i> closer to us now
than they were at the starting line.



Trim up. Pull back.



Wow. Doing 13 knots.
The whole Pacific.



The boat, two boat lengths from you.



I'm gonna be a pro sailor.



Forget landscape design,
I'm doing this for the rest of my life.



I think the owner's
on the wheel.



Lock it. Big trim, big trim,
big trim, big trim.



No, no, no, not now, not now.



- Got it. Hold.
- Just keep your cool, Piet.



We just got rolled,
unfortunately.



Pretty bloody close.



I can see the smiles
on their faces.



That one guy
gave us the thumbs up.



That's pretty cool.



What are they doing here?



- And not that right now.
- Nah, they're filling the space left.



- They only have one sheet on.
- Yeah, that would verify it.



- Trim.
- Yeah.



We'll take a fast-way line to Hawaii.



Bold. What's going on?



- Wow, look at that.
- What are they doing?



They're animals,
and they even got Kilroy out.



I think they lost a halyard.



They lost their kite.



They got something
on the rudder, I don't know.



We had a sea serpent.
And it was wrapped around our rudder.



And they looked at us like we were nuts.



We went a little bit to leeward.



I haven't had that kind of experience



with another boat
in the middle of the ocean before.



That was a super
professional move.



What happened?



They thought they
had something on their rudder,



so they went kite down
on deck, staysail in.



Back down, staysail out.
Bow down, kite up. See ya.



- God.
- They're kinda truckin'.



It's like they can't sail at night,
but then the day comes



and they're like, "OK,
I guess we'll start sailing again."



Then they sail pretty well.



I feel like
they gain at night.



<i> It's been</i>
<i>a really intense 24 hours.</i>



<i>We've got these pro sailors,</i>
<i>this super-fast boat.</i>



<i>And actually have crossed paths</i>
<i>with them this morning</i>



<i>and then fallen behind them</i>
<i>in two big maneuvers,</i>



<i>and then now to be beating them</i>
<i>again after the last 12 hours.</i>



<i>It's really keeping us motivated</i>
<i>and keeping us going.</i>



To give you an example
of what we're up against,



the navigator for <i>Samba...</i>



...wrote the program
that we use to navigate,



that all the boats use
to navigate in the Volvo,



the around-the-world races,
in the America's Cup, stuff like that.



- So...
- It's cool to be racing against him,



have him right there.
Thinking with him.



That was a cool feeling.



What is <i>Samba Pa Ti?</i>
Is it a song or something?



<i>Samba Pa Ti</i> is a great song
by Carlos Santana.



Trim.



Hold that.



Trim, Bear, trim.



Pull.



I can't keep
trimming it like this.



It's... you're... You require a lot more
trim than most people,



and it's exhausting.
I know you're trying to do the fastest,



but... we're just going to
have to rotate more or something.



Trim.



- Pull.
- Damn.



She's drunk on estrogen.



Put her down.



How would you feel if you were
the only guy on an all-girl boat?



I'll take miserable
for 100, Alex.



We think Genny's had the better deal
than we would on the other end.



Who wants to
with his hands crossed?



This is like a fireside
session here, a fireside chat.



Well, really, hmm, uh...



You know, obviously none of us
know exactly how it is to be Genny,



but it's got to be
a little more difficult...



Genny takes it pretty well
for being the only girl.



Spectacular. She's a trouper.



Not meaning to be mean,
but we give her a lot of...



...just, you know, out of,
being, you know, teammates.



It would be very interesting to see,
you know...



To be on the opposite
side of... of...



I wouldn't
want to do it at all.



Dude, if I could do this again
with 15 girls, I'd do it.



- It wouldn't be the same.
- It wouldn't be.



Little does
<i>Samba</i> know what



we're talking about
while we were drag racing.



Y'all have seen
the standings this morning.



We're still in good shape.



Believe it or not, even with <i>Samba's</i>
advantage right now



we still have them uncorrected.



But they are making a charge for it,
and we have to, too.



Let's not give in.
We're in second place.



<i>Samba</i> is just there, the big trophy.



So, let's just get our heads high,



and let's just push into this. OK, guys?



- Shoops, did they just jibe?
- Yes.



- They did?
- Yes.



Gutsiest move I ever saw.



Shoops, take the wheel, mate.



B-Man. Jess. You're not
rolling that, are you?



No. No.



Chuck it in the bag.
B-Man, I need you up here.



B-man, I said I needed you, mate.



That's not what I heard.



- Yes, it is.
- I can't hear ya.



Come here.



Why have they jibed already?



What are you not telling me?



- His tack's at 290.
- The pressure's over there.



Is it worth taking it to get there?



The Troll Nazi's back.



The thing is,
you can't get pissed though.



- He, uh...
- It's always a good point.



It's always in the interest of speed.



OK, guys.
We cleared for a jibe? Let's do it.



Let it go. Let it pass.



Smoothly, guys.
Make every movement smooth. OK?



I say it so many times.



<i>Samba</i> looked pretty far away.



I just want them to go away.



So we can go back to sailing again.



Day nine.



Eleven... twent... Elev...



I got 11:30.



And this race is taking way too long.



I'll talk about food, how about I talk
about that? All right.



Well, today's the last day
of full meals.



So tomorrow
we're starting the rations.



So we've got... five meals.



And if that's three days,
then it's two meals a day.



So if we're doing two meals a day,
we should do it like 6am and 6pm.



- Yeah.
- Is that cool?



- Yeah.
- All right.



Captain,
you ready for it now?



- Uh-uh. I'm eating dirt.
- It's really bad.



- Ah, that's not doing it.
- There's nothing else.



Do it with five of these in your mouth.



Yeah, there ya go.
Get rid of the aftertaste.



Uh, one of our little hobbies
that we've kinda picked up



is talking about the instantaneous
cravings that we have.



Tuna salad sandwich.



Chocolate chip cookies
dipped in milk.



Dirt, tofu and... Uh.



- Jars of peanut butter.
- Peanut butter?



They just...
...protein.



Leave it out in the sun.
You get a peanut butter milkshake.



Look at the camera.



Hadn't eaten since
yesterday at 6:30.



It was awesome.
I didn't even chew.



I felt like my dog, Jake. When he eats,
he doesn't breathe, he just chews.



Eh, about half of it's chewed...
like, he chews about half.



Swallows the other half. No breathing
through the entire process.



Am I getting my point across?



This is how desperate we are for food.



We will eat the worst meal we've ever
had just because we're hungry,



and we won't have another meal
for eight hours.



Forcing it down your throat,
and at the end of it,



you feel like you're gonna throw up.



Bunch of us
are craving Reese's



and different types of pizza,
and Chinese food so.



Chicken teriyaki
makes me want to vomit now.



<i> Hey, guys.</i>



<i>Steve-O wants to know</i>
<i>what's taking so long.</i>



<i>Oh, and ask Turtle if he'd rather have</i>
<i>a nice tall glass of Baileys</i>



<i>at the dock instead of a mai tai.</i>



<i>Don't worry about</i> Samba, <i>you guys can</i>
<i>lose them in those shoals up ahead.</i>



<i>If you don't know what that's from,</i>
<i>we're not friends anymore.</i>



<i>Godspeed</i> M.L., <i>stay fast</i>
<i>and don't eat each other.</i>



Signed, Pirate.



I'm a lucky bastard.
I'm lucky.



Are you sure we're headed west?



Hawaii can't possibly
be this far away. Come on.



Nothing's this far from land.



This is just stupid.
This is bad placement.



Why would you put islands
this far away from?



Get Towiller up here.
Tell him to find Hawaii.



Towiller, we need to pull
your house out the water.



Hello there!



We sail, like, it's
a considerable part of the race



with <i>Samba</i> within ten miles
the whole time.



Last night they split
and went 120 miles to the south of us.



I mean, we're really far away
and they're all by themselves.



We just felt that if we could
get south, we'd get better breeze.



Based upon the numbers, it wasn't
one of these, you know, roll the dice.



Yeah, like when you look
at these guys down here, <i>Samba Pa Ti,</i>



it looks like we've been given
a lottery ticket.



So I'm not, um, opposed
to just taking this down



and getting just in front of their nose.



And if it lifts... we're clean.
They're behind us.



If it knocks, we're on the mark.
In the bank.



- Yeah.
- In the bank.



- Hang on to your butts.
- Oh.



Let's get these guys.



- Roll call is a dogfight.
- Is it?



It's a friggin' dogfight.



I'm gonna catch this boat up
in front of us, like it was my business.



We want both trophies. We want
to be the first TP52, and we want to...



Trim! ...win our... win our division
as well. That would be sweet.



Have you seen
the squall over here?



Tropical squalls
can be critical.



You can gain dramatically
on competitors by playing the squalls.



There we go.



Twenty knots.
That's directed to the reef.



The sky's about to go boom.



- Who's the boom king?
- I'm the boom king!



Oh, baby!



- Hey, mister!
- Twenty-four knots.



Hey, well,
why don't you just race, guy?



- We're like modern pirates.
- Pirates, man.



We don't even own this boat.



Breaking up
like an '80s band, baby.



They'll have a comeback tour.



Of course.



That's how
<i>Behind the Music</i> always ends.



Yep, it was fun
while it lasted.



Rainbow, baby.
It's getting close.



Let's keep it
going fast. All day.



- I think I see land.
- Yeah.



- Whoo.
- I think I see a volcano.



- Yeah.
- Yeah!



Yeah, you can just see the edge of Maui
right on the bow right now.



That's Maui.



Are we less than 12 hours?



I'm going to the top of the rig
one last time.



One last time, forever.



Turtle, let's take you
to the paradise city.



Oh, my God.
It feels so good.



Gotta love it. Whoo!



Maui right behind us.



Very, very excited to be back home.



Been 11 days of just seeing the horizon,



we're finally seeing the islands.



And... I...



...really have a lot to say,
and I just can't say it.



Um...



Whoo!



A little happy
little Turtle up there.



Break out the inscription tool!



Spike yourself away!



I'm lovin' this!



So here we are,
we're in the famous Molokai Channel.



It feels really good to be here.



We, uh... we don't really know
where our competitors are,



'cause all the tracking devices
are lost or malfunctioning.



So we're sort of coming down here with
our eyes closed on our competitors.



One thing these guys
are gonna have to be conscious of



is what we call "channel fever."



There's a good chance
that they'll be a little over-tired



and a little overexcited and they'll
starting to be thinking about...



Uh, about hitting the dock.



I'm excited to see my family.



All I wanna do is go to Oahu.
I just wanna get to Honolulu.



Dude, I want mai tais.
Would anybody like an espresso?



I'm making some downstairs.



This race has been won
and lost on the last day before.



You know what's really
interesting right now?



I'm coming down to the finish



and I have planned for nothing
after this finish.



This finish has been
my, like, whole year,



like, my whole life up to this point.



<i> Aloha,</i> Samba Pa Ti!



<i>Transpac Yacht Club</i>
<i>welcomes you</i>



<i>and congratulates you</i>
<i>on your successful race.</i>



I'm sure Mr. Kilroy thought that,



he had a superior crew, superior boat,
and would beat them handily.



But, that's not the way it came out.



It was just give
and take for quite a while.



I think it was Robbie Naismith
saying, "Come on, guys.



We can't let these kids beat us. We
couldn't live with that on our rsum."



You know, saying it kiddingly,
but, yeah,



you know, that's just sailboat racing.



Yeah!



<i> Diamond Head control,</i>
<i>Diamond Head control,</i>



<i>This is Diamond Head Light.</i>



Samba Pa Ti <i>crossed the line at 0156.</i>



<i>Congratulations,</i> Samba Pa Ti.



It's sort
of mind-blowing for me.



I just take it all in, especially now,



ten miles from the finish line.



You, uh... you can't
really contemplate it.



It's pretty heavy.



Now I'm gonna go steer my boat home
for the last time ever.



Keep trimming, Towiller.
Not there yet, mate.



- Pull string in.
- Pull!



- It's there.
- Red buoy!



See that red buoy? You were a dinghy
sailor before, weren't you?



- It's there.
- Oh!



- You ready?
- Ready.



Wow, this is gonna be sick!



Here we go, home!



Oh! We made it!



Not yet, not yet.



Nice work, you guys.



- Yes, we're home! Yeah, buddy!
- Whoo!



<i> Aloha,</i> Morning Light!



<i>Transpac Yacht Club</i>
<i>welcomes you to Honolulu</i>



<i>and congratulates you</i>
<i>on your successful race.</i>



When I did
this thing the first time,



it changed me for the rest of my life,



but I don't think
I knew that at the time.



I think it kind of
comes to you later on.



You have a resource
that you can look back on



and say, "I dealt with life and I dealt
with it well and gracefully."



That's what it really means in the end.



It's about the journey.



<i>This is gonna be an epic story.</i>



<i>This is gonna be our first story.</i>



<i>This is gonna be probably</i>
<i>our favorite story.</i>



<i>How it all began.</i>



Here we are, day 14
of the <i>Morning Light</i> adventure,



except this time, we're on land.



Finally, believe it or not, we're here.



Wow. It's, uh...



Yeah. I'm not gonna be
able to, uh...



I don't think I could find a team
like this ever again, so...



...it's, uh... Yeah, it's...



It's emotional. These guys are...



Hang on.



Yeah.
I need a minute.



Sad! Oh, I'm so sad.



Yeah.



Wow.



If they put this
in the film, I'll kill 'em.



- Of course it's going in.
- Yeah.



I was just telling Robbie,
I was like, you know,



I thought I was gonna be all broken up
and upset when you're leavin',



but... I'm gonna see all you
guys again in like a month



and like, constantly after that.



- I'm not worried about it at all.
- Yeah.



Once again, BZ to the rescue.



Just a sign-off to my team.
Last day as skipper.



Last day, uh, steering my boat,



and, uh, let's go for a ride.



OK, boys! Let's go.
One last time.



Together.



<i> When the race was over,</i>
<i>it basically was over for us.</i>



<i>We had spent so long with each other</i>



<i>and the finish was what we had</i>
<i>always dreamed of and hoped for</i>



<i>and wished for and then</i>
<i>we crossed the finish line,</i>



<i>and it was like, "What next?</i>
<i>Wh-Where do we go from here?"</i>



<i> The best thing was just</i>
<i>this sense of accomplishment at the end.</i>



<i>If we had won the race we would have</i>
<i>thought that the Transpac was easy.</i>



<i>You have to respect that race a lot.</i>



<i>It's a long distance and a lot goes on.</i>



<i> The biggest thing</i>
<i>I learned from the project</i>



<i>has just been the real value in teamwork</i>
<i>and how special it is</i>



<i>when 15 people can come together</i>
<i>and accomplish something</i>



<i>that no one of us</i>
<i>could have done on our own.</i>



<i>The days you go out</i>
<i>and everything goes the way you planned</i>



<i>and everything goes perfectly,</i>
<i>you learn nothing from.</i>



<i>It's the days you go out</i>
<i>then everything falls apart,</i>



<i>that's when you learn the most.</i>



<i>And I really learned that</i>
<i>in a very literal way on</i> Morning Light



<i>and really kind of changed</i>
<i>my whole outlook on life.</i>



<i> You realize</i>
<i>what's important to you.</i>



<i>To be able to pack my whole life</i>
<i>in a small bag for ten days,</i>



<i>just those things</i>
<i>and being on the ocean,</i>



<i>was probably the happiest</i>
<i>ten days of my life.</i>



<i> Being on an ocean</i>
<i>is about as close</i>



<i>as you can put together</i>
<i>peace and fear.</i>



<i>It's absolutely peaceful</i>
<i>and it's just so beautiful...</i>



<i>... but, man,</i>
<i>it can go bad pretty quickly.</i>



<i>I think we were about as well prepared</i>
<i>as we could be for anything.</i>



<i> You...</i>
<i>You realize, out on the ocean,</i>



<i>it's... it's a different type of life,</i>
<i>and it gives you a new respect.</i>



<i>Kind of hard to explain.</i>
<i>It's like you feel in power,</i>



<i>like you've conquered somethin'</i>



<i>that you know a lot of people</i>
<i>haven't had the chance to do.</i>



<i>You feel very fortunate</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>



<i> Pretty much what</i>
Morning Light <i>did for me</i>



<i>is it opened a lot</i>
<i>of boundaries that I had.</i>



<i>My grades have improved at college,</i>
<i>my work has improved on land</i>



<i>and now I feel like</i>
<i>I can just get out there</i>



<i>and anything that I apply myself,</i>
<i>I can do.</i>



<i> You know,</i>
<i>whenever I see my teammates,</i>



<i>they'll always be</i>
<i>these special people to me.</i>



<i>We could be in the middle</i>
<i>of New York City,</i>



<i>we could be in Shanghai,</i>
<i>we could be hikin' on a mountain,</i>



<i>and we're still gonna have a connection</i>
<i>that no one else around us shares,</i>



<i>and that's a special feeling.</i>



Take two!
