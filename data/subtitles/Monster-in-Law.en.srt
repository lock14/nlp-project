1
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:38,248
# You thought you had
found a good girl #

2
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:41,914
# One to love you
and give you the world #

3
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:45,982
# Now you find
that you've been misused #

4
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:48,893
# Talk to me,
I'll do what you choose #

5
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,487
# I want you to #

6
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,395
# Tell Mama #

7
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:54,559
# All about it #

8
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,762
# Tell Mama #

9
00:00:56,803 --> 00:00:58,566
# What you need #

10
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:00,402
# Tell Mama #

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,908
# What you want #

12
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:06,310
# And I'll make everything
all right #

13
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:09,611
# That girl you had
didn't have no sense #

14
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:14,279
# She wasn't worth
all the time that you spent #

15
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:18,121
# She had another man
throw you outdoors #

16
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:21,252
# Now the same man
is wearing your clothes #

17
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:24,263
# I want you
to tell Mama #

18
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:26,322
# Tell Mama #

19
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:28,493
# What you want #

20
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:32,403
# And I'll make everything
all right... #

21
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,538
Hi, it's Charlie.
Leave a message.

22
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:40,876
Hi, Charlie. It's Carol
from the LA Temp Agency.

23
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:44,680
Listen, Dr. Batel's office needs you
for tomorrow. Is that okay?

24
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:47,050
Let me know. Bye.

25
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:49,146
Good morning, neighbor.

26
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,919
Hey.
Help yourself.

27
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,482
Oh, thanks.
I was out of everything.

28
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:55,085
Aw, why do I even bother?

29
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:57,756
You know, Remy, I gave you
that key for emergencies.

30
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:59,493
Extreme emergencies.

31
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:02,366
It was.
I needed caffeine.

32
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:05,428
I don't know.
This is good. I'd even wear it.

33
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:08,032
Good, 'cause I've got to go.
I'm late for my first client.

34
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:10,065
But you stay,
have breakfast, take a shower.

35
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,101
Go through my drawers.

36
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:14,113
# Tell Mama #

37
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:16,115
# All about it #

38
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:18,310
# Tell Mama #

39
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:20,376
# What you want #

40
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,752
# Tell Mama... #

41
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:25,622
- Hey, Charlie.
- Morning.

42
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,628
- Are the boys ready?
- Dragon! Zorro!

43
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,226
Hey!
There are my boys.

44
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:34,790
Come on. Yay.

45
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:36,860
- See you later!
- Bye!

46
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:40,270
- Be good, boys!
- Whoa! Slow down!

47
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:42,332
# Tell Mama
all about it #

48
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:47,142
# Tell Mama
what you need... #

49
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,479
"Romance is in the air today.

50
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:52,815
No one can resist
your obvious charms."

51
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:59,119
Well, Otis, your horoscope
seems accurate.

52
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,956
Stop it.
Come on.

53
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:03,087
Let's read mine.
Okay.

54
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,530
"Do not leave your house today."
Too late.

55
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:10,297
"And stop looking so hard.
Love is right in front of you."

56
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,634
Hey.
What's wrong?

57
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:42,890
I ordered a nonfat latte.
I can taste the fat.

58
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:44,665
I would be happy
to change it for you, sir.

59
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,934
Can't you even make a friggin' cup
of coffee? I can taste the fat.

60
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:49,567
How hard it is to make
a friggin' cup of coffee?

61
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,440
I can make another one
for you if you'd like. I'd be happy

62
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:53,537
- to exchange it for you, sir.
- Hello? It's okay.

63
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,572
- You've done enough, thanks.
- I'm sorry.

64
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,482
Karma.

65
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:06,353
- Have a good one.
- Thanks, girl!

66
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:09,624
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

67
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,230
Hi.

68
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:16,758
Hi.

69
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,936
I don't know how
to read tarot cards.

70
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,309
- Why am I in the cards?
- Come on, just try.

71
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:29,315
Okay, well, this crazy old lady
keeps coming up.

72
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:32,113
The knight
in shining armor.

73
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:34,279
- Mmm! That's mine.
- No no no. What?

74
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:36,949
- I saw this guy twice today.
- That guy?

75
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,049
Two times in one day.
That's got to be a sign, right?

76
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:40,992
Mm, a sign.

77
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:44,087
Yeah, okay. What did he say
when you talked to him?

78
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,530
I didn't talk to him.

79
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:51,769
Well, are you sure
he saw you?

80
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:55,172
Yeah!
I mean, I think so.

81
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,176
Okay, honey,
we're worried about you

82
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,178
because you're turning
into a little bit of a freak.

83
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:01,737
Yeah, we think
it's from not having sex.

84
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,477
- Exactly.
- Look, just because...

85
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:06,485
I haven't been in
a relationship in a while

86
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,384
doesn't mean
I'm miserable.

87
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:11,049
I just want a sweet guy,

88
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:14,993
you know, a guy
who's strong but still...

89
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:17,496
...opens a door
once in a while.

90
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,499
And who notices
things and...

91
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:24,094
you know, maybe
makes a difference.

92
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:28,631
Maybe he completes you.

93
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,034
Oh.

94
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,341
You complete me.

95
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:36,645
Oh, sorry.

96
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,982
Dr. Batel's office.
Hi, Mrs. Reynolds.

97
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:42,989
- Go to Grandma's, tell her
I'll be home late.

98
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:45,583
- I still have stitches to do...
- Yeah, can you please hold?

99
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,183
I'll see you
at home.

100
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:49,320
You know what? You go ahead.
I can do that for you.

101
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,456
- Oh thank you, Charlie. You're a doll.
- No problem.

102
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:54,524
Hey, George.

103
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,626
- How are you doing, Charlie?
- Good.

104
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,604
- What do you got there?
- The doctor asked me

105
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:00,469
to bring it from home.

106
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:04,076
Whew! Okay!

107
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,102
All right. The doctor
will be right with you.

108
00:06:18,324 --> 00:06:22,351
# I said "Leap into
my arms, babe" #

109
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:25,159
- Thank you.
- # Come on, dive into the stove... #

110
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,826
We're here!

111
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,459
Thank God
you guys are here.

112
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:31,299
I am down two girls
tonight. Here.

113
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:33,305
- Sorry, that's all I got left.
- Sweet.

114
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,036
Wow. You know, I love that I am
now comfortable enough with my sexuality

115
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:39,272
- to wear something like this, you know?
- Looks good on you.

116
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:40,939
- Hey, what's up?
- Take off the apron now.

117
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,777
- Sorry.
- Where do we start?

118
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:45,614
Okay, uh, hand out
these shrimp balls.

119
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,779
There has got to be
a better name for those.

120
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:50,551
- I don't think it's that bad of a name.
- What's wrong with the name?

121
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,357
# I said, I say,
sometimes we look back... #

122
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:57,693
- Oh my God, that's him.
- Whoa! Who? Who?

123
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,096
The guy I ran into.
He's here.

124
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:01,032
- Where?
- What?

125
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,092
That is three times in two days.
What are the chances of that?

126
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,798
- Um, like, none.
- That's Dr. Fields.

127
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,171
This is his party. He just moved
back from San Francisco.

128
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,675
- Really?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,542
Well, you're right.
He is hot.

130
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:16,572
# Flirting
with disaster #

131
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:20,985
# You're the one
I'm after #

132
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,787
# I think I've found
my destiny #

133
00:07:28,294 --> 00:07:30,660
# I can fly #

134
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:33,188
# On the wings
of my heart #

135
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,928
# Deep inside #

136
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:37,163
# I've been falling apart #

137
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:38,727
# L-l-love #

138
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,366
# There's a magic in you #

139
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:43,807
# And I'll be #

140
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:46,471
- # Under your spell... #
- Here's the best part.

141
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:48,413
The guy then goes
into cardiac arrest,

142
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:51,076
Kevin performs CPR
on the guy,

143
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:53,585
saves his life again.

144
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,282
God.
Disgusting, isn't he?

145
00:07:57,323 --> 00:08:00,315
No, you are amazing.

146
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,385
Yeah.

147
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,962
Excuse me?

148
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,060
W-wait wait wait.
What do we have there?

149
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:14,369
Oh, um, balls.

150
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,568
Uh, shrimp balls.

151
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,873
Um, shrimp in...

152
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:21,380
...balls.

153
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:23,211
I'm sorry,

154
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:26,343
but we're not really
into fish genitalia.

155
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,855
Yeah, okay.

156
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,652
Was she really listening
to our conversation?

157
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:32,919
Excuse me.

158
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:38,062
Wait a second.

159
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:41,032
Um, so I know two things
about you... you work in catering,

160
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,001
and you have a lot of dogs.

161
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:45,197
Oh, that... no.

162
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:46,830
Uh, I'm a dog walker.

163
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,865
I'm not some crazy dog-lady
with 12,000 dogs.

164
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:52,537
- That's why.
- And I'm sorry about before.

165
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,547
I didn't mean
to be eavesdropping.

166
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,208
Well, you're right.
You shouldn't have.

167
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:59,343
You should have stayed
and talked to me.

168
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:01,910
Well, your girlfriend
seemed pretty offended.

169
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:04,389
Oh no, that's...
that's not my girlfriend.

170
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,392
I-I don't have a...
I'm sing...

171
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:08,553
I don't have
a girlfriend.

172
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:10,529
What?

173
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,554
Nothing.

174
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:15,966
Nothing. Um, I'm Charlie.
Charlotte, but Charlie.

175
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:18,232
Well, I'm... I'm Kevin.

176
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:20,933
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

177
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:23,534
Uh-oh.

178
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:27,512
What? What does
"uh-oh" mean?

179
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:29,811
It looks like someone else
is mowing your lawn, Fiona.

180
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:31,339
I'm gonna go
destroy these.

181
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:41,250
Excuse me.
I'll see you guys.

182
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:46,363
Oh, my shoes
are killing me

183
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,493
which means
they must look fabulous.

184
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:52,231
Can I get you anything?

185
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:55,139
One of him on a platter.

186
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:56,971
Such a waste.

187
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,944
What's a waste?

188
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:01,572
Oh, you didn't know?

189
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:04,583
Kevin's gay.

190
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:07,711
- What?
- Yeah.

191
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,517
That's Kit, the groom.

192
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:12,046
Or maybe he's the bride.
I can't remember

193
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,889
which one's the top
and which one's the bottom.

194
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:17,726
Yeah, they're getting married
next Christmas in Maui.

195
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,664
I didn't get that vibe.

196
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,567
Trust me.

197
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:28,469
Thanks.

198
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:34,573
Look at
that dude's arms!

199
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:37,310
I used to have
such good gaydar.

200
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:03,835
Oh, you're home.
Thank God.

201
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:07,277
- I'm exhausted.
- What did you do today?

202
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:10,214
- Hi, it's Charlie. Leave a message.
- Went to the post office.

203
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,114
Uh, hi, Charlie.

204
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:13,982
- This is Kevin Fields.
- That's him.

205
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,921
I don't know if you remember me
from the party the other night,

206
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:20,619
but I was just calling,
uh, to see if, um,

207
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,857
maybe... maybe you wanted
to walk my dog.

208
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,454
What? No!

209
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,261
Hang up the phone.

210
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,292
No, actually, you can't,
because I don't have a dog.

211
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:33,203
So maybe you could
walk me.

212
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,475
Hang it up.

213
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,479
All right, you know,
I'm-I'm gonna go now.

214
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:44,643
Call me at 555-0118
and ask for Dr. Fields.

215
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:46,652
Okay, thanks. Bye.

216
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:49,052
Oh man, that was...
that was horrible.

217
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:51,818
Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath
for a callback on that.

218
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:54,349
Yeah, she'll call me back
if she wants to walk an idiot.

219
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:56,089
Yeah, I'm not going
to disagree with you.

220
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:04,601
So takeout
or raid your fridge?

221
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,534
Here we go.

222
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,806
Take it easy, Lilly.

223
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:14,472
Easy.

224
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:23,422
Hi.

225
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:26,823
You never called me back so I figured
I would bring the coffee to you.

226
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:29,123
Thanks.

227
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:32,723
Um, look, I think you're
a really nice guy and everything,

228
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,097
but I don't know why
you called me.

229
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:36,965
- Hmm?
- I'm a woman.

230
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:39,233
Yeah, I love that fact.

231
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:43,333
Have you ever been
with a woman?

232
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:46,868
Excuse me?

233
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:49,347
I mean, have you only
ever been with men?

234
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,940
Men?
What are you talking...

235
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:53,008
whoa whoa whoa.
Wait a minute, I'm not gay.

236
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:55,350
- You're not?
- No.

237
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:58,482
No, I like women.
Lots of... no, not lots of women,

238
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:00,185
but you know what I mean.

239
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:02,194
Why did you think
I was gay?

240
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:05,023
Awkward.

241
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:07,589
Okay, I got to go now.

242
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,658
Wait wait.
Wait wait wait.

243
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:11,829
Okay, I'll prove to you
that I'm not gay.

244
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:14,772
Let me take you out on Friday night.
We'll watch the playoffs,

245
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:17,105
I'll order a pizza,
I'll completely ignore you.

246
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:20,771
Give me one good reason.

247
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:23,944
'Cause I'm different.

248
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,645
Really?

249
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:28,551
Okay, what color
are my eyes?

250
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:34,025
Well, at first glance,
your eyes are brown.

251
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,689
But when the light hits them
they change to amber.

252
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,359
And if you look really closely around
the iris the color is pure honey.

253
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:45,696
But when you look
into the sun

254
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:48,138
they almost look green.

255
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:50,165
That's my favorite.

256
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,548
How did I do?

257
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:01,280
I would've settled
for brown.

258
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:04,950
- Okay!
- Peanut, let go!

259
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,117
Off! Off!

260
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,821
I'm sorry he bit you.

261
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,329
I mean, they all have their shots
so it should be fine.

262
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:14,094
Seriously, don't worry about it.
It barely broke the skin.

263
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,192
- Outside.
- Did you just move in or something?

264
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:18,669
No, I've been here
a year and a half.

265
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:20,399
Oh, nice place.

266
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:23,840
I should have some hydrogen peroxide
around here somewhere.

267
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:25,503
What is all this stuff?

268
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,638
Oh, I'm a yoga instructor.

269
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,978
- This?
- And a Little League coach.

270
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:31,677
And a dog walker
and a caterer.

271
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:33,685
I told you I'm a temp.

272
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:36,244
That is not true.
She is an incredibly talented artist.

273
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:38,621
- Remy! Remy!
- I mean, look at her sketchbook.

274
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:40,250
- She hides it right under there.
- Remy!

275
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,420
What?

276
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:45,453
He's not...

277
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:54,431
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

278
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,706
Found it!

279
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,040
So you're an artist, too?

280
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:03,276
Uh, I like to dabble
in a lot of different things.

281
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:06,308
I mean, life's too short
to live the same day twice, right?

282
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,377
Yeah. That's a good
philosophy to live by.

283
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:10,685
My dad always used
to say that. Come on.

284
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:13,385
- Used to?
- Oh, yeah,

285
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,894
- my parents died when I was little.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:18,362
That's okay.
It was a really long time ago.

287
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:20,456
- You ready?
- Yeah... I mean,

288
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,490
it's a little embarrassing.
I'm the doctor.

289
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,765
I'm the one who's supposed
to look at the... ah! Ow!

290
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,999
- Oh my God. I'm sorry!
- I'm just kidding.

291
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,563
I never get to do that.

292
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,500
Okay, because the cut is,
like, three inches higher.

293
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:35,571
Sorry.

294
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:38,083
- Do you need my phone?
- Oh, no thanks.

295
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:41,416
It's just my mom. And it's only
her second page of the day.

296
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:43,251
She's just getting started.

297
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:45,757
- Well, you're all set.
- Thank you.

298
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:49,895
So, do you think, uh...

299
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:53,296
we could do this again sometime,
maybe without the biting?

300
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:55,766
Yeah, that would be nice.

301
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:02,299
- Heard from Kevin yet?
- Not yet. I've paged him.

302
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:03,831
Would you page
him again?

303
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,707
- Good morning, Stan.
- Good morning.

304
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:08,646
- You're in a good mood.
- The last time the network executives

305
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:11,275
came to my dressing room
I got my own show and a big fat raise.

306
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:15,014
- Yeah and I had to start kissing your...
- Viola Fields? Oh my God!

307
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:17,955
It is such an honor
to meet you.

308
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,548
Oh thank you, darling.

309
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:21,719
Would you mind
just signing this autograph?

310
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:24,752
For my grandmother.

311
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:28,359
I'd love to.

312
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,369
You know what else
I'd love?

313
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:33,099
I'd love you to get me a latte.
Do you mind?

314
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:35,369
- Okay.
- Thanks, hon.

315
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:37,672
Hi, guys.
How are you?

316
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:43,074
That woman is a legend.

317
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:45,549
Shouldn't you be
getting the latte?

318
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:48,075
I just can't believe
they picked me to replace her.

319
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:55,754
Oh, shit!

320
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:57,820
I-I've been replaced?

321
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:00,491
I'm so sorry, Viola.

322
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:03,161
Psst!
I'm fine.

323
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:06,296
I mean, you've had
an amazing career, Viola.

324
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:12,403
It's just that we're trying to appeal
to a younger demographic.

325
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:14,276
I'm fine.

326
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:16,474
I'm fine.

327
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:19,617
God damn!
Get my manager on the phone!

328
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:22,746
And then I'm gonna call
the head of the...

329
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,756
Uh, we're on in two minutes.

330
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,315
- Okay.
- Will you get her to come?

331
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,386
- Please!
- Okay, she'll be ready.

332
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,797
I'm ready.

333
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:37,029
# ... love got jeans and a tee #

334
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:39,094
# Am I kinky or sweet? #

335
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:42,437
- # Take a look inside my makeup bag #
- # Ooh #

336
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:44,739
# If you wanna love me #

337
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:46,745
# How good or bad
I can be... #

338
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:49,043
- Are you okay?
- I'm great.

339
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:51,106
Hey, I've had
a great run.

340
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,017
I've done exclusives
with Kissinger, the Dalai Lama,

341
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,577
Muhammad Ali...

342
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,646
four sitting presidents...

343
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,453
three of them hit on me.

344
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:01,483
Five Emmys!

345
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:05,221
Now I'm being replaced
by a young thing

346
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:06,959
whose grandmother
loves me.

347
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,967
You know what
I'm gonna do?

348
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,730
I'm gonna finish out
my contract

349
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,739
and I'm gonna leave this show
with my dignity intact.

350
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:15,638
Okay, coming back
from commercial.

351
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:17,141
Three, cue announcer.

352
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:19,440
Today on "Public Intimacy,"

353
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:22,276
pop singing sensation
Tanya Murphy.

354
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:25,477
And now we're live
with Viola Fields.

355
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:28,976
Four, three, two...

356
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,889
Well, that was
very nice.

357
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:35,155
My goodness, you have a big voice
for such a tiny girl.

358
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:36,821
You're gonna miss
Viola Fields.

359
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:38,420
Have you always
been a singer?

360
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,432
Ever since I was
a child.

361
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,400
I would sing
in school plays, choirs.

362
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:45,871
- How old are you?
- I'll be 17 next month.

363
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:51,437
W-what do you do for fun?

364
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:54,002
I love watching
really old movies.

365
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:56,571
- They're my favorite.
- Really? Really, which ones?

366
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:59,550
Well, "Grease"
and "Grease II."

367
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:02,418
Um, "Benji."
I love "Benji."

368
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:05,515
"Free Willy," um...

369
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,185
"Legally Blonde,"

370
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:09,717
"The Little Mermaid."

371
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,491
- Oh.
- Yeah... oh, I know.

372
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:18,932
You ever read
a newspaper?

373
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:20,529
Newspaper?

374
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:23,098
Viola, the girl
has stars on her nipples.

375
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:25,872
I don't have
much time for that.

376
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:30,348
So basically, you have absolutely
no idea what's going on in the world?

377
00:19:30,382 --> 00:19:32,441
- Oh, l...
- And yet, you've sold

378
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:36,148
over five million albums... CDs,
to millions of kids

379
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:39,487
- who listen to your insipid lyrics.
- What is she doing?

380
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:42,119
"You want to know me,
look in my makeup bag."

381
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:45,824
You're influencing
an entire generation of kids

382
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:47,833
who won't know how
to think straight,

383
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,835
or vote for a president,

384
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:52,702
or remember the significance
of Roe versus Wade.

385
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:56,333
Oh! I don't support
boxing as a sport.

386
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,173
I think
it's too violent.

387
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:01,111
Y'all better get that
little girl out of there.

388
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:07,148
- Holy crap!
- Get us off the air!

389
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:10,349
- Quick!
- Go to commercial! Go to commercial!

390
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:12,357
Crazy bitch!
Get off me!

391
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,621
- Cut! Cut! Put in the Bow Flex tape!
- Get her off!

392
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,252
Juice Man, something!

393
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:21,731
Oh, I don't support
boxing as a sport.

394
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:24,201
I think
it's too violent.

395
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,706
Oh.

396
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:35,942
I wanted you to take one last look
at the old Viola.

397
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:39,109
Oh, thank God
I've changed.

398
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:41,016
Yes.

399
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:42,884
Well, just remember

400
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:45,550
the breakdown was
only a few months ago

401
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:48,389
so take it nice
and slow out there.

402
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,258
No stress.

403
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:52,321
Absolutely.

404
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:55,197
In fact, I'm going
to take a vacation.

405
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,702
I've been promising my son
we'd go to Africa

406
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:59,567
since he was a little boy.

407
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:02,039
And I finally have
the time.

408
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:03,701
That's wonderful.

409
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:05,573
Not to worry,

410
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:07,511
I'm in complete control.

411
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:11,979
Ruby! Ruby,
my dear old friend.

412
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:15,214
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

413
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:17,415
Well, good,
they still have you medicated.

414
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:19,754
Ruby, I figured it out.

415
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,386
- Life, I mean.
- Oh, this ought to be good.

416
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:26,364
It's not about how many celebrities
I interview or what my ratings are.

417
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:30,357
- It's about relationships and family.
- Oh!

418
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:31,733
Me and my son.

419
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh, I just spoke to Kevin.

420
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,497
- Did you get the tickets?
- Sure did. Right here.

421
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:39,807
He's going
to be so surprised.

422
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:42,313
Yeah, the three of you
should have a good time.

423
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:45,283
- Three?
- Yeah, uh, you, Kevin

424
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:48,775
- and his new girlfriend.
- New girlfriend?

425
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:51,221
That's a lovely surprise.

426
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:52,814
Is it?

427
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:55,827
Well, I mean,
it can't be too serious.

428
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:57,829
I've only been away
a few months.

429
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:14,443
Well, that's
the end of it.

430
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,641
Where do you want me
to put this?

431
00:22:16,682 --> 00:22:18,650
Oh, under the bed.

432
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:21,710
Uh, you sure you don't want me
to put it by the door so you can

433
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:24,917
make a quick escape to the apartment you
still have for some reason?

434
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:27,323
Now come on. You agreed to me
subletting my apartment.

435
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,385
I would have agreed to anything
to get you to move in here.

436
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:33,988
Oh, these are great.
Are they new?

437
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,660
Oh, no!
You can't look at those!

438
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:37,726
- 'Cause they're not finished yet.
- Oh, sorry.

439
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,601
- Okay? Please?
- Okay.

440
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,367
Here, I'll put them back.

441
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:44,706
I forgot to tell you, we're having lunch
with my mom tomorrow.

442
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:47,177
Oh!

443
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:49,476
It'll be fine.
I promise.

444
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:56,413
You want
to take a shower?

445
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:58,753
Hmm.

446
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,553
Yeah! Okay!

447
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:05,256
# It's just a ride,
it's just a ride #

448
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:07,356
# No need to run,
no need to hide #

449
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,391
# It'll take you
round and round. #

450
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:12,233
All right, so tell me
about your dad.

451
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:14,102
Well, he died
when I was two.

452
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:15,936
But that was just
her first husband.

453
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:18,340
At the time she was
a freelance journalist

454
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:21,710
and then she married this guy
who was a network exec

455
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:23,715
and got her her first
on-air break,

456
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,774
but divorced him
for Alec Wrigley.

457
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:27,649
Wait, the actor?
I thought he was...

458
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:29,654
Oh, he was.
It lasted about two years

459
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:33,055
till she threw him out for sleeping
with her second husband.

460
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:35,060
Wait, how many times
has she been married?

461
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:36,721
- Well, four.
- Wow.

462
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,390
But, you know, her career
was always the main thing.

463
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:42,594
She just lived for it.
Well, her career and me, of course.

464
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:44,898
And, basically,
now I'm all she's got.

465
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:51,576
Here we are.

466
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,135
Oh, no.

467
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:03,721
Oh, playing dress-up,
are we?

468
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,625
- Shut up. Is that the Dalai Lama?
- Yeah.

469
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:14,257
- Oh my God, That can't be real.
- It is.

470
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:18,759
Did you know
all these people?

471
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,772
- Some of them.
- Kevin!

472
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:23,775
- Look at you, all handsome.
- Ruby!

473
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:25,743
Good to see you.

474
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:27,507
Yeah, you too.

475
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:29,104
Now, forget about
my mother.

476
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:32,311
This is the woman you need
to get through. Charlie, this is Ruby.

477
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:35,445
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- Oh, the pleasure's mine.

478
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:39,184
Uh, excuse us.
I've got to talk to him about a rash.

479
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:46,287
You're bringing a girl home
to meet your mother now?

480
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:48,094
Yeah, Ruby, I am.

481
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,499
The women is fresh off
the funny farm.

482
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:53,972
I mean, why don't you
come back, let's say... next spring?

483
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,031
Oh, the trees
will be blooming.

484
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,702
- It'll be so beautiful. She'll love it.
- How is she?

485
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:01,508
She's good.
The first thing she did

486
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:04,038
when she got home was make me
lock up all the booze.

487
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:06,050
It's Oprah!

488
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:08,484
Oprah!

489
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,215
Yeah, Oprah.

490
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:13,315
There's one in there
with the cast from "Good Times" too.

491
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,916
So how big is this place?

492
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:18,429
About four acres.
There's a tennis court,

493
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:21,489
two swimming pools,
indoor and outdoor... it's kind of crazy.

494
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:24,093
What?
No helicopter pad?

495
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:25,501
Oh, no.
There's one out back.

496
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:27,164
I'm kidding.

497
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:28,673
Kevin!

498
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:31,608
Oh, I've missed you
so much!

499
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:33,577
I promise I'll never
leave you again.

500
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,414
Oh my God, Mom.
Look at you. You look fantastic.

501
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:41,215
- It's just something I threw together.
- Come here.

502
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:43,813
- What?
- I want to introduce you to someone.

503
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:45,653
- Charlie. Mom.
- Kevin.

504
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:48,353
Charlie, this is Mom.

505
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:50,020
Mom, Charlie.

506
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:52,189
Oh, hi.

507
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,534
Oh, I'd love to just be able
to think of it and make it.

508
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:59,002
I must have spent
the last 30 years

509
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:00,937
looking for the perfect
little black...

510
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,941
- Cocktail dress.
...cocktail dress. Yes.

511
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:04,636
I know.

512
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:07,873
Well, it doesn't matter. You could
wear anything with your figure.

513
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:10,245
- I mean, you look amazing.
- Oh, honey, thanks.

514
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:13,945
Listen, when you're my age,
if ain't broke, you fix it before it is.

515
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:34,869
Why the question mark?

516
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:36,534
Oh, 'cause
I just don't know.

517
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,136
I love your jewelry.

518
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:42,146
- Oh, yes. Yes, thank you.
- I love that.

519
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,774
- I like it... the earth tones.
- It's fantastic.

520
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:47,011
- Where did you get this from?
- My first husband.

521
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:49,782
That's Kevin's father. He gave it to me
when we were in Peru.

522
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:51,789
- It's very earthy.
- It's like the dress,

523
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:53,188
very earthy.

524
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:03,295
I just think it's wonderful
that you've tried so many temp jobs.

525
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:05,326
Think of all
the experiences you have.

526
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:09,836
You've been
so quiet, Kevin.

527
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,901
Oh, well, it's kind of hard to get
a word in edgewise with you two.

528
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:15,607
Oh, is he great,
or what?

529
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:17,615
I tell you too,
that's a little scary.

530
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:19,742
Enjoy it while you can.

531
00:27:19,785 --> 00:27:21,446
Here you go,
some more coffee.

532
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:24,114
Actually, I was a little nervous
about the two of you meeting.

533
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:25,623
- Really?
- Why?

534
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:27,454
Well, 'cause it's
important to me.

535
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:29,983
Mom, you're the most
amazing woman I've ever known.

536
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:34,029
And, Charlie,
I've never met anyone like you.

537
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:36,364
You're real,
you're honest.

538
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:38,995
And although we've only
known each other a few months,

539
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:41,335
I-I feel like
I've known you forever.

540
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:45,365
I guess what I'm
trying to say here...

541
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:51,280
is what are you doing
for the rest of your life?

542
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,511
What?

543
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:01,889
Oh my God!

544
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:04,395
Charlie, will you
marry me?

545
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:09,163
It's...
it's too sudden.

546
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:10,566
- She's in shock.
- No!

547
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:13,162
- I mean, I am, but...
- Yes!

548
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,539
Seriously?

549
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,509
Seriously.

550
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:20,306
No no. Say "no."

551
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,677
Yes. Yes!

552
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:25,012
Yeah!

553
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,608
Oh, gee... oh!

554
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:34,385
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

555
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:37,395
- Congratulations!
- Oh my God. I can't believe this.

556
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:38,919
I am so happy for you.

557
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:41,728
Congratulations!
I'm so pleased

558
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:44,964
that you're going to be
my daughter-in-law.

559
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,473
Oh, congratulations.

560
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:50,998
- I can't believe this.
- I'm so happy for you.

561
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:54,410
- Thank you!
- You're going to need a moment alone.

562
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:56,846
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

563
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:58,179
Oh!

564
00:28:58,216 --> 00:28:59,274
Shit!

565
00:29:05,223 --> 00:29:07,248
Medicine.

566
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:09,260
Let's see.

567
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:10,921
No.

568
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:13,123
What's... ah!

569
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:14,792
14% alcohol!

570
00:29:20,372 --> 00:29:23,398
- You are so crazy! Oh my God!
- I almost forgot.

571
00:29:23,442 --> 00:29:26,900
I've been carrying this around for two
weeks waiting for the perfect moment.

572
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:28,936
I can't believe this
turned out to be it.

573
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:34,675
- Kevin.
- Try it on.

574
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:42,883
It is the perfect moment.

575
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:48,057
Maybe you should go
check on your mom.

576
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,035
Oh, she's fine. She's probably
calling all of our relatives.

577
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:54,004
Oh, Holy Spirit...

578
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,337
surround me with light.

579
00:29:57,576 --> 00:30:00,636
Please rid me
of my negative karma

580
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,544
and my wickedness.

581
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:05,744
Please help me be
a better person.

582
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:11,788
I could just kill
that dog-walking slut!

583
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:17,361
Of course.

584
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:20,455
She's pregnant.

585
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:25,766
So, goodness.
That was a lot to take in at teatime.

586
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:28,364
- Oh, you're telling me.
- I had no idea

587
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:30,306
that you guys
were so serious.

588
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:32,367
Kevin, you never
mentioned anything.

589
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,901
- Mom.
- Here's what I want to say.

590
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:36,971
It's wonderful
being in love.

591
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:41,611
But I don't think marriage is
the best solution to a thing like this.

592
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:46,790
Well, you know nowadays
a girl has so many alternatives

593
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:49,259
to getting married...
there's adoption, abortion,

594
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:51,592
- lesbianism... Hmm?
- Whoa, Mom!

595
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,656
- What are you talking about?
- Well, I mean, it's so sudden

596
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,929
I have to assume
there's a pressing reason.

597
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:59,027
Oh oh, no.

598
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,628
Charlie's not pregnant.

599
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:05,499
Call me old-fashioned,

600
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:07,978
marriage is a sacred union

601
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:11,471
that should only be entered into
with the utmost care.

602
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,507
Weren't you married
four times?

603
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:16,950
Yes, dear.

604
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,620
Which would make me an expert,
don't you think?

605
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:22,627
Excuse me.

606
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:27,356
It's the hospital.
I'll be right back.

607
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:29,162
Okay.

608
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,169
You want me to go
with you?

609
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:33,194
No, stay right there.

610
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:48,048
You know, this is as sudden
for me as it is for you.

611
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:50,054
It's too sudden, right?

612
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:51,885
You think?

613
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:53,390
Yeah.

614
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:55,017
Really?

615
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:04,391
I mean, what's the rush?
It's not like the old days

616
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:06,336
where you had to get married
and have kids,

617
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:08,532
and have it all figured out
by the time you were 21.

618
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:10,598
- Exactly.
- We have options now.

619
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:12,735
And I've always liked
having my options, you know?

620
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:14,142
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

621
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:17,546
This is so... big.

622
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:22,945
What am I...
what am I doing?

623
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:28,625
I love Kevin.

624
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,928
I want to spend the rest
of my life with him.

625
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:35,797
Oh my God!
I'm getting married!

626
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:41,429
Ruby!

627
00:32:41,473 --> 00:32:44,340
Ruby, I need a bottle of champagne.
We're going to celebrate.

628
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:47,004
May I have the key
to the liquor cabinet please?

629
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:48,307
What key?

630
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:51,983
The key, Ruby.

631
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:54,542
Key?
There's no key.

632
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:57,555
Ruby, give me the key.

633
00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:00,023
You want to take this
outside?

634
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:04,656
Bring me the key.

635
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,398
And fix your hair.

636
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:14,371
You look like
a damned cockatoo.

637
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:21,509
She is such
a fabulous assistant.

638
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:30,753
Hey, do you think
your mother liked me?

639
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:33,019
Of course. Why?

640
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:36,459
I don't know, because she called me
a pregnant lesbian?

641
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:40,496
I'm sure she meant that
as a compliment.

642
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:42,966
Trust me.
She loved you.

643
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:45,526
Oh, they're gone?

644
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,232
I'll just put this baby
back to bed, okay?

645
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:52,039
My son
the brilliant surgeon

646
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:56,776
is gonna marry a temp.

647
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:08,822
Gonna need something
stronger than this.

648
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,260
Where's that martini?

649
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:13,992
Hooch will not solve
your problems.

650
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:17,263
She's going to destroy him.

651
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:19,327
It is so clear.

652
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,965
She's got no money,
no career goals.

653
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:24,907
She was just waiting
for a rich innocent

654
00:34:24,943 --> 00:34:26,535
to step right
in her path.

655
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:29,012
Oh, Kevin's
smarter than that.

656
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,981
Come on,
you raised him well.

657
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:32,642
He's a good boy.

658
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:34,777
But he's a man.
That's the problem.

659
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:37,879
The only time they think straight
is when they have an erection,

660
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:41,050
and it's usually pointed
right at the trampiest woman.

661
00:34:41,092 --> 00:34:44,391
You talking about
her or you?

662
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:47,557
Look, there's nothing
you can do.

663
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,032
Just let it go.

664
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:51,535
You know what you need?
A project.

665
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:53,196
Or another husband.

666
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:55,570
You know, why don't you
marry another gay guy?

667
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:57,234
That was fun.

668
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:59,334
You know, you're right.

669
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,277
I do need a project.

670
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:04,076
And I have
the perfect one.

671
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:06,242
I am going
to save my son.

672
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:08,411
Here.

673
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:10,648
- What?
- You go use those old contacts of yours

674
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:13,486
to get all the information you can
about that little pimp.

675
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:16,016
And exactly what do you
expect to find?

676
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,223
Everybody's got
a past, honey.

677
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:21,391
Find something.

678
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,697
And I'm going to open up
the Montecito house

679
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:25,430
and get a party planner.

680
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,462
I'm going to give them
an engagement party.

681
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:30,770
And then what?
Lock her in the basement?

682
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:33,039
When he sees how out of place
she is in his world,

683
00:35:33,077 --> 00:35:35,477
it's gonna be over.

684
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:38,141
This will end badly.

685
00:35:38,183 --> 00:35:40,048
Get me another one
of those.

686
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:43,020
# Ooh-ohh #

687
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:45,818
# I just want to
get down with you #

688
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:47,484
# Eh! #

689
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:50,494
# I just want
to get close to you #

690
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:52,655
# Ooh-ohh #

691
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:54,597
# I just need to go
farther... #

692
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:57,726
Is it me, or is each house
you take me to bigger than the last?

693
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:07,677
But I thought your mom
said this was a barbecue.

694
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:11,113
Oh my God. It looks like she's invited
everyone I've ever known.

695
00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:15,476
And they're all
in black tie.

696
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,488
Oh, there's my mom.
Mom!

697
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:20,855
Darlings!
How was the trip?

698
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:23,053
- Welcome.
- I'm sorry.

699
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:25,289
- I didn't know this was a formal party.
- Well, that's because

700
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,525
I have something for you.
I bought you a new dress.

701
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,396
Oh, see?
There's a dress upstairs.

702
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:31,698
- Thank you.
- Besides, you look great in anything.

703
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:34,671
Exactly. You always look
so clean and shiny.

704
00:36:34,706 --> 00:36:38,335
Oh, Kevin, your tuxedo
is upstairs in your room.

705
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:40,970
But first I want you to meet
some friends. Come.

706
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:42,843
- Prince Amir.
- Can I change first?

707
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:48,745
- This is Sarah. Kevin.
- You know Kevin.

708
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:51,414
And this is Charlie.
She's a temp.

709
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:56,352
Charlie, this is the man that
introduced the euro to the global market.

710
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:58,157
- Mr. Prime Minister.
- Viola.

711
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:00,892
Oh, Marie. You know my son,
but this is Charlie.

712
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:03,867
- Very good to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

713
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:06,166
- She's a temp.
- Yeah.

714
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:08,729
I worked in a bank once.

715
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:10,968
Oh, look! There's
the Poet Laureate and...

716
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:14,410
oh, Charlie, first I want you to meet
the Secretary of Commerce.

717
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:16,106
Viola, please let me
change first.

718
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:18,274
I don't want to meet her
in my flip-flops.

719
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:21,717
Of course, of course. Ruby, would
you show Charlie to the guest room?

720
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:24,119
- Come on, Charlie.
- Thank you. Thank you.

721
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:32,730
Wow!

722
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:34,493
Oh my...

723
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:36,659
it's vintage.

724
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:40,297
Oh, Fiona.

725
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:43,364
- You look stunning.
- Thank you. So do you.

726
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,433
My goodness.

727
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:47,706
Kevin just went up
to his old room.

728
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:50,373
- Why don't you go say hello to him?
- I'd love to.

729
00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:52,315
Good girl.

730
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:09,024
Fiona, what are you doing here?
I'm dressing.

731
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,592
Why don't you let me give you
a hand with that?

732
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:14,127
Give it up, Fiona.

733
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,604
You know, you and I had
a very strong bond once.

734
00:38:19,644 --> 00:38:22,943
No, you and I had
very strong drinks once.

735
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:24,539
That's not true.

736
00:38:24,582 --> 00:38:27,710
Kiss me. I'll remind you
how good it was.

737
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:29,117
What are you doing?

738
00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:30,916
I'm engaged.
I'm happy.

739
00:38:30,955 --> 00:38:33,253
It's gonna fit!

740
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,122
Why did she get me
such a small dress?

741
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:39,592
I have two asses.

742
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:45,796
It'll fit.
There we go.

743
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:47,464
Okay.

744
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:49,996
Okay! Okay!

745
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,945
What is it about her
that's so special?

746
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,972
I don't know but I plan on spending
the rest of my life finding out.

747
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:03,947
Kevin!

748
00:39:03,988 --> 00:39:08,288
God! Men in love
are really hot.

749
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:10,920
Fiona!

750
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:12,930
Oops! Um...

751
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:16,559
I was just giving Kevin
a congratulatory kiss.

752
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:19,297
Don't, uh, worry.

753
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:21,771
Why would I worry?
He's gay, right?

754
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,210
Charlie!

755
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,717
Charlie, that was not
what it looked like.

756
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:39,416
I'm going home.

757
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:42,483
I've destroyed
priceless couture.

758
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:47,521
I embarrassed myself
in front of 70% of the world's royalty.

759
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:49,533
Oh! I forgot, yeah!

760
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:53,765
I just caught you making out
with your ex-girlfriend.

761
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:55,773
Charlie, let me explain.

762
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:58,071
Ugh!
It doesn't matter.

763
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:02,942
I can't do this.

764
00:40:06,384 --> 00:40:09,012
I don't belong here,
Kevin.

765
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:13,318
And if I don't belong here
then maybe we don't...

766
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:14,984
Hey hey hey.
Listen to me.

767
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:17,017
It's you and me now.

768
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:20,020
This isn't my world anymore.

769
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:22,055
You're my world.

770
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:30,974
Okay?

771
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:33,568
Now let's get the hell out of here.
I'm taking you home.

772
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:35,806
Okay.

773
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:37,246
Um...

774
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:41,183
Let me try and get out
of this dress and then...

775
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:43,414
Okay, see you
downstairs.

776
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:06,909
# There's a million miles
to go #

777
00:41:06,944 --> 00:41:12,109
# Till our happiness lives #

778
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,486
# There's a million miles
to go #

779
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:22,050
# Till our happiness lives. #

780
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:24,854
Do you like it?

781
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:26,591
Yeah, it's great.

782
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:28,929
I'm so glad you
finally decided to do it.

783
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:33,232
I don't know. I just woke up today
and it just felt like home.

784
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:35,637
I'm gonna do
all three walls.

785
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:38,369
You know, I think it's time
to take a break.

786
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:39,774
Oh, wait!

787
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:42,109
- Wait a minute.
- Whoo whoo whoo!

788
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:43,875
I can't let it dry
too much.

789
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:46,645
Oh God!

790
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:51,121
Are we getting out of bed
today, "Camille"?

791
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,453
What for?

792
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:55,789
I could die
and nobody would care.

793
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:57,351
I would.

794
00:41:57,395 --> 00:42:00,091
You promised me
a face-lift.

795
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:03,589
Sit down, Ruby.
Sit with me, hold my hand.

796
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:08,768
Have you got anything
on the girl yet?

797
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:10,774
Nothing. Nada.

798
00:42:10,808 --> 00:42:12,742
No criminal record.
No debt.

799
00:42:12,777 --> 00:42:16,110
Good grades. Went to design school.
And then a string of odd jobs.

800
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:18,843
Isn't that exactly what
somebody with a past does?

801
00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:21,317
What about drugs?
What about promiscuity?

802
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:23,320
She's had fewer lovers
in her entire life

803
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:25,982
than you did
at closing day of Woodstock.

804
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:28,924
Well, find something.

805
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,657
Well, I guess if I had
a hair sample maybe I could take it

806
00:42:32,697 --> 00:42:35,825
- to my little crime lab and...
- Perfect.

807
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:37,767
I'll get to work on it.

808
00:42:37,802 --> 00:42:40,464
Listen to me.
There is nothing.

809
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:43,598
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe she's a good girl?

810
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:45,632
Oh, don't joke.

811
00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:50,536
I would like to speak to that woman
who got back from the loony bin.

812
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,344
Is she around?

813
00:42:52,383 --> 00:42:55,147
Because you are taking me
for a spin in the crazy mobile.

814
00:42:57,421 --> 00:42:59,048
Ruby, Ruby.

815
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,684
Everybody knows that when
a woman marries a man

816
00:43:01,726 --> 00:43:03,694
she marries his mother
too, right?

817
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:06,629
What if I drive her crazy?

818
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:09,155
Okay, now you're
foaming at the mouth.

819
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:15,365
Oh!

820
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:18,274
Charlie and Kevin's house.

821
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:21,073
Oh, I forgot you live there.

822
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,981
I didn't realize that you
had already moved in.

823
00:43:26,017 --> 00:43:29,919
Kevin, stop it. I'm on the phone
with your mother! I'm sorry, Viola.

824
00:43:29,954 --> 00:43:32,320
The slut's practically
fornicating with him!

825
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:33,846
- Stop it!
- I don't blame her.

826
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:35,449
That boy's a fine piece of ass.

827
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:39,054
Hold on, Viola.
He's... stop it! Right here.

828
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:41,087
Actually, Charlie,
the reason I'm calling

829
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:43,862
is I wondered if you'd
like to have lunch next week.

830
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:47,530
- Really?
- How would Tuesday work for you?

831
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:50,233
Yeah,
Tuesday's perfect!

832
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:53,243
Listen, Viola, I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now,

833
00:43:53,277 --> 00:43:55,336
um, but Tuesday's fine.

834
00:43:55,379 --> 00:43:57,210
Yeah, me too.

835
00:43:57,248 --> 00:44:00,240
- Lots to do!
- Okay, bye!

836
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,310
Oh.

837
00:44:05,723 --> 00:44:08,351
I'll go get the vodka.

838
00:44:20,805 --> 00:44:22,966
It's good to see you.

839
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:24,998
There she is.

840
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:31,843
Charlotte.

841
00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:35,215
Hi. I'm going to have
the garden salad

842
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:39,245
and the low-cal Chinese dressing
and a decaf iced tea.

843
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,020
- And you, miss?
- Oh, um, I'll just have a...

844
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:45,460
cheeseburger
with fries and a soda.

845
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:47,123
- All right.
- Okay.

846
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:49,997
You continue
to surprise me.

847
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:53,128
Aren't you worried about fitting
in your wedding dress?

848
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,139
Well, I mean, I'm making the dress
to fit my body,

849
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:57,800
not the other way
around.

850
00:44:57,842 --> 00:45:00,777
Whoa. I wish I had been
that confident when I got married.

851
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:03,541
I'll tell you one thing
you're gonna have that I never did,

852
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:05,640
a stupendous wedding.

853
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:09,517
And it's important that we
book the church right away.

854
00:45:09,553 --> 00:45:12,681
I always thought
that Kevin looked like Jesus

855
00:45:12,723 --> 00:45:15,385
in the cathedral down
on Second Street. Mmm.

856
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:19,920
Actually, we were thinking
of having...

857
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:22,228
a non-denominational
service,

858
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:24,962
being that I'm more spiritual
than religious.

859
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:26,333
Oh.

860
00:45:27,872 --> 00:45:30,170
What about my place then?

861
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:32,641
That way we don't even
need to book a location.

862
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:34,974
And Kevin was born there
and grew up there.

863
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:37,776
Oh, it would mean
so much to him. I'll plan it all.

864
00:45:37,815 --> 00:45:41,444
We'll have that marvelous band
that the Swansons' had at their wedding.

865
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:43,510
And a divine cake.
Oh, honey!

866
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:45,681
No no no!
Tsk tsk tsk!

867
00:45:45,723 --> 00:45:47,691
Chewing,
it's a disgusting habit.

868
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:50,826
Oh, hold still.
I've gotta... gotta...

869
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:52,522
- There! Got it!
- Ow!

870
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:55,862
Thanks, um...

871
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,993
What do you think
about peach?

872
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:02,236
- Oh, um, excuse me.
- Yes?

873
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:04,298
Can I get another salad
without the nuts?

874
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:06,400
- I have allergies.
- Okay.

875
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:09,311
I'm allergic to nuts,
and eggs, and shellfish,

876
00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:11,906
and blueberries.
Oh... and soy.

877
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:15,146
It's amazing you've been able
to nourish yourself all these years.

878
00:46:16,454 --> 00:46:18,422
Oh, yeah!
The cake!

879
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:22,517
I'm thinking traditional vanilla
with strawberry drizzle.

880
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,929
Look, Viola, I really do
have all of this under control.

881
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:28,591
I made this for you.

882
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:31,430
It's your wedding planner book.
Peach.

883
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:35,502
Oh.

884
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:37,507
Is that a picture
of me and Kevin?

885
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:41,238
Oh, and... present time
from your new mama!

886
00:46:41,278 --> 00:46:43,109
Thanks.

887
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:52,417
Wow!

888
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:55,425
It's big! You can see
the thorns on the roses.

889
00:46:55,459 --> 00:46:58,087
You'll wear it on your wedding day,
just like I did.

890
00:46:58,129 --> 00:47:00,791
Of course I was
a virgin when I wed.

891
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:03,629
But we'll just pretend
with you.

892
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:05,635
Now, about the wedding...

893
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:08,365
the two of you are going to arrive
in a horse and carriage.

894
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:11,772
And the driver's top-hat
will match the horse's saddles,

895
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:13,504
and the ribbons
on the doves

896
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:16,604
that will be released
at the exact moment

897
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:19,582
of "I do," hmm?

898
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:23,578
And I've been in touch
with your bridesmaids.

899
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:25,316
How do you know
their names?

900
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:28,189
Well, Kevin told me.
And I think for the honeymoon

901
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:31,023
St. Bart's is the absolute
best place for you to go

902
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:33,291
- 'cause Kevin adores it.
- Hey, just hold on!

903
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,991
Just wait
a minute, okay?

904
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:39,302
No.

905
00:47:39,336 --> 00:47:41,566
Thank you, but no.

906
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:44,472
Thank you,
but no to everything.

907
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:47,739
No to the horse
and buggy.

908
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:50,713
No to the top-hats,
and to the doves and geese

909
00:47:50,748 --> 00:47:53,649
and any other farm animals
you're thinking of using that day.

910
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:56,244
And definitely no to you
planning our honeymoon.

911
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:57,652
- What?
- Oh no.

912
00:47:57,688 --> 00:47:59,053
I can... oh!

913
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:01,922
- Oh oh!
- What's wrong?

914
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:03,950
- "Oh no" what?
- My pills, my pills!

915
00:48:03,994 --> 00:48:05,291
Okay.
Well, let me help you.

916
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:07,923
- Oh!
- Viola!

917
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:09,956
- Oh, no!
- Wait, Viola!

918
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,695
Viola!

919
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:13,703
Viola!

920
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:16,535
Oh my God, Viola.
Oh my God!

921
00:48:16,574 --> 00:48:18,542
- Give her some room.
- Help!

922
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:21,306
- Give her some air.
- My God, is she dead?

923
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:23,404
- No!
- Get her some help.

924
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:25,438
It couldn't be
that easy.

925
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:32,255
She's had
an anxiety attack,

926
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:34,484
which can feel like
a heart attack.

927
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:36,152
She's gonna be okay.

928
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:39,890
But she definitely needs
to take it easy. No stress.

929
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,990
She said that you were
yelling at her,

930
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:46,764
that you refused her gift
and said she couldn't plan our wedding.

931
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:49,500
Tell me that's
not true.

932
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,475
Well, technically...

933
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:53,771
yes.

934
00:48:53,811 --> 00:48:56,575
But, hold on.
I didn't yell at her.

935
00:48:56,614 --> 00:48:58,980
And she just kept pushing
and pushing and pushing.

936
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:01,883
And, okay, I admit it.
I snapped a little bit. But...

937
00:49:01,919 --> 00:49:04,820
What was I supposed to do?
She wouldn't take no for an answer.

938
00:49:04,855 --> 00:49:07,585
Come on, look, you know
what a hard time she's been having.

939
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,684
- So she's a little difficult.
- Difficult?

940
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:11,160
A two-year-old
is difficult.

941
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:13,425
- She's like... ah!
- Come on, she's all alone.

942
00:49:13,464 --> 00:49:15,432
I'm all she's got...
we're all she's got.

943
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:17,764
Come on.

944
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:19,268
Excuse me.

945
00:49:19,303 --> 00:49:21,863
I'm Dr. Chamberlain,
the psychiatrist in residence.

946
00:49:21,905 --> 00:49:23,429
- Are you Mrs. Fields's son?
- Yes.

947
00:49:23,474 --> 00:49:26,136
- May we speak in private?
- Actually, this is my fiance.

948
00:49:26,176 --> 00:49:27,973
We can talk.
Um, is she okay?

949
00:49:28,012 --> 00:49:31,175
Well, I just completed your mother's
interview and I'm concerned.

950
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:35,083
It's possible that she's on the verge
of a psychotic break.

951
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,055
I should probably see her
at least twice a week, minimum.

952
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:41,887
Also, I prescribed her
some anti-anxiety medication.

953
00:49:41,925 --> 00:49:44,587
If she starts to feel
overwhelmed, they'll relax her.

954
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:46,220
Does she live alone?

955
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:47,628
Uh, yeah.

956
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:49,792
Well, I feel
it would be best

957
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,733
if she were cared for
by relatives...

958
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:54,169
people that are closest
to her during this time.

959
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:56,695
Just until we're confident
that she's out of danger.

960
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,174
All right.
Well, thank you, Doctor.

961
00:50:00,544 --> 00:50:02,774
Oh, God.

962
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:04,713
I've got that
medical conference.

963
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:06,215
What am I gonna do?

964
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,344
You know what?
Don't... don't worry about it.

965
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:12,048
Um, I'll take care of her.

966
00:50:14,658 --> 00:50:16,421
Thank you.

967
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,291
- Come on.
- What?

968
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:20,593
- No, come with me.
- No no, the doctor said no stress.

969
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:23,862
- Charlie, come on. Enough already.
- I'll stay here. Kevin!

970
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,294
Come on.

971
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:34,573
I am so sorry.

972
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:37,011
No, Mom, don't be.
It's okay, really.

973
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:38,036
Charlie?

974
00:50:40,184 --> 00:50:42,652
I'm sorry too, Viola.

975
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:44,950
No, I was too pushy.

976
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,917
No.

977
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:50,518
You weren't.
Look, Viola...

978
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:54,497
I would love it if you would
help me with the wedding.

979
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:57,364
It's all right,
sweetheart, l...

980
00:50:57,401 --> 00:50:59,631
I don't really think
I'm up to it.

981
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,535
My nerves are shot.

982
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:06,469
Mom...

983
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:11,338
Mom, Charlie and I think
you should live with us for a while,

984
00:51:11,382 --> 00:51:13,316
until you feel better.

985
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,181
Are you sure?

986
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:18,418
Oh!

987
00:51:19,757 --> 00:51:22,123
Oh, I can't possibly.

988
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:23,956
- I couldn't.
- Mom, it's okay. Relax.

989
00:51:26,063 --> 00:51:27,928
I couldn't possibly.

990
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:32,157
Not unless I know
Charlotte's forgiven me.

991
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:35,434
Will you?

992
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,071
Me?

993
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:40,099
Yeah, I forgive you.

994
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:48,383
You just put those
anywhere.

995
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:53,714
- Hi!
- Hi.

996
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:56,225
- Are you feeling better?
- I'm much better, thank you.

997
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,421
- Great.
- Sweetheart, I'm kind of thirsty.

998
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:00,760
- Would you... is the kitchen over there?
- Yeah, sure.

999
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:03,130
- Great. Goodbye.
- Okay.

1000
00:52:04,468 --> 00:52:07,096
- Hey, Charlie.
- Are you moving in, too?

1001
00:52:07,137 --> 00:52:09,105
No, I don't like
the neighborhood.

1002
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:11,573
Look, do you have any
firearms in the house?

1003
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:14,736
- No.
- You might want to get one.

1004
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:23,245
When will you be back?

1005
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:26,518
Soon as I can, honey.
I promise.

1006
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:28,787
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

1007
00:52:28,826 --> 00:52:31,989
Yeah. I mean, hey,
it's only at night, right?

1008
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:34,497
And, I mean, she's gonna
sleep most of the time

1009
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:37,466
with those pills
the doctor gave her. Right?

1010
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:40,231
Look, I know my mom can be
a little challenging.

1011
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,602
So if you have any
problems just call me.

1012
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:44,698
I'm on the first flight back,
I promise.

1013
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:47,039
Okay.
Well, hurry home.

1014
00:52:47,077 --> 00:52:49,045
And who knows?
By the time I get back,

1015
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:51,604
maybe you two
will be best friends.

1016
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:53,639
Oh, am I interrupting
something?

1017
00:52:53,684 --> 00:52:55,811
- Uh, no, Mom, come in.
- The caterer called.

1018
00:52:55,853 --> 00:52:57,821
He still thinks
I'm doing the wedding.

1019
00:52:57,855 --> 00:53:00,949
He sent over a sample plate
'cause I gave him the colors you wanted.

1020
00:53:00,991 --> 00:53:03,152
I said absolutely no peach.

1021
00:53:03,193 --> 00:53:07,755
And from now on, everything
goes through my new daughter.

1022
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:09,663
- Thank you.
- Yeah?

1023
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,292
Okay, I'll be
right down, thanks.

1024
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:15,294
- Oh, here. Look.
- Oh, it's beautiful, Viola.

1025
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:17,739
- Thank you.
- Oh, I'm glad you like it.

1026
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:19,765
- Thanks.
- My car's here. Gotta go.

1027
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,277
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom.
- Okay.

1028
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:24,109
Oh, bye, sweetie.
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

1029
00:53:24,147 --> 00:53:26,377
- We're gonna have such a good time.
- I love you.

1030
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:28,441
- I'll be a good roommate. I promise.
- Okay.

1031
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:30,976
Ohh!

1032
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:34,320
It's so nice
to have a girlfriend.

1033
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:36,019
Yeah, huh?

1034
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:04,348
Viola?

1035
00:54:04,388 --> 00:54:07,824
- Are you all right?
- I can't sleep.

1036
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:12,722
I feel so alone.

1037
00:54:12,763 --> 00:54:14,731
I do.

1038
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:16,733
You're not alone.
I'm here.

1039
00:54:18,335 --> 00:54:21,304
Did you take
your pills?

1040
00:54:21,338 --> 00:54:24,899
My pills?
Oh no, I forgot.

1041
00:54:24,942 --> 00:54:27,410
Could you get them
for me, sweetie?

1042
00:54:27,444 --> 00:54:29,469
They're on the sink.

1043
00:54:29,513 --> 00:54:31,504
Sure.

1044
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:40,580
Here they are.

1045
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:44,527
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1046
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:47,496
Oh, I don't have any water.
Could you get me some water please?

1047
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:50,022
Okay.

1048
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:52,535
Oh, I can't drink out
of the tap.

1049
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:56,798
Would you get me some Evian...
with ice?

1050
00:54:57,941 --> 00:54:59,340
Yeah.

1051
00:55:07,818 --> 00:55:09,115
Here you go.

1052
00:55:09,152 --> 00:55:10,813
Oh, thank you.

1053
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,153
You have a good night,
okay?

1054
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,421
Charlotte?

1055
00:55:18,462 --> 00:55:20,362
I hate to ask you this,

1056
00:55:20,397 --> 00:55:22,763
but it's my
first night here.

1057
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,393
Could you stay with me?

1058
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:27,335
Please?

1059
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:29,805
Sleep with me.
Be a good girl.

1060
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:34,777
Huh? No no no!

1061
00:55:34,811 --> 00:55:37,371
No no, don't!

1062
00:55:39,149 --> 00:55:41,242
God! Viola!

1063
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:43,411
- Are you okay?
- No, let go of me, you!

1064
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:49,114
No.

1065
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:03,840
Huh? Oh!

1066
00:56:03,874 --> 00:56:05,808
Okay. Okay.

1067
00:56:27,898 --> 00:56:30,833
Hi, how was your day?

1068
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:32,596
It was... okay.

1069
00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:34,433
Wonderful!

1070
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:35,938
You're cooking.

1071
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:39,032
I wanted to make you
dinner all by myself.

1072
00:56:39,076 --> 00:56:40,737
- Sit.
- Okay.

1073
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:46,182
It's steak
and kidney pie.

1074
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:49,481
Actually, the steak didn't defrost
in time so it's mostly kidney.

1075
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:51,544
Mmm!

1076
00:56:51,588 --> 00:56:53,579
- Do you like it?
- Mm-hm!

1077
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:57,952
I made a decision today.

1078
00:56:57,994 --> 00:57:00,929
I called my lawyer
and I asked him to redo my will.

1079
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:03,831
I want to include
my new daughter.

1080
00:57:07,537 --> 00:57:09,630
Really, Viola,
that's not necessary.

1081
00:57:09,673 --> 00:57:11,538
Oh, don't be silly.
I want to.

1082
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:14,840
Of course they have all these
stupid questions that they want to ask.

1083
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:17,745
You know, like, "Are you
currently an illegal alien?"

1084
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:20,511
Oh, uh, no.

1085
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:23,915
Oh, that's interesting.
Okay.

1086
00:57:23,954 --> 00:57:27,151
Um, are there any hereditary illnesses
in your family?

1087
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:30,159
You know, the kind that could be
passed on to grandchildren?

1088
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:32,058
- Uh, no.
- No.

1089
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:35,087
How many men have you been
sexually active with?

1090
00:57:35,132 --> 00:57:37,327
What? Why would they
want to know that?

1091
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:40,165
That many, huh?

1092
00:57:40,203 --> 00:57:42,899
Would you be willing to sign
a prenuptial agreement?

1093
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:47,366
- Excuse me?
- I know.

1094
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,311
They're such nosy bastards.
It's none of their business.

1095
00:57:50,347 --> 00:57:51,871
Let's just deal
with this later.

1096
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:54,349
No, why don't we deal
with it right now?

1097
00:57:57,354 --> 00:57:59,549
I'll tell you what,
I'll clean up the kitchen

1098
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:00,920
and you continue
enjoying your dinner.

1099
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:03,585
No no no.

1100
00:58:03,627 --> 00:58:06,095
You did all the cooking.
I'll clean up.

1101
00:58:06,129 --> 00:58:07,960
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1102
00:58:07,998 --> 00:58:10,398
I am kind of tired.
Thanks.

1103
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:12,333
Well, I'll just
go up to bed then.

1104
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:14,929
I had kind of a difficult
night last night.

1105
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:16,962
You had a difficult night?

1106
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:23,078
He's skidding
out of control.

1107
00:58:23,113 --> 00:58:25,274
This bus is out of control.

1108
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:32,889
Is somebody there?

1109
00:58:32,923 --> 00:58:35,187
Tina.

1110
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:38,961
Tina.

1111
00:58:38,995 --> 00:58:40,656
Who the hell is that?

1112
00:58:59,683 --> 00:59:01,583
Oh.

1113
00:59:01,618 --> 00:59:03,586
What?
Oh my God.

1114
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,589
- I thought you were sleeping.
- Well, I couldn't sleep.

1115
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,591
Hmm? What do you think
of my outfit?

1116
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:11,526
This is a ceremonial robe
given to me by Chairman Mao.

1117
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,188
These go with the robe.

1118
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:16,199
This was a birthday gift
from the Dalai Lama.

1119
00:59:16,233 --> 00:59:18,428
He never forgot
my birthday.

1120
00:59:18,468 --> 00:59:20,902
Of course now
he doesn't care anymore.

1121
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:22,905
- Do you mind if I sit with you?
- No.

1122
00:59:22,939 --> 00:59:24,907
- Just for a little while.
- Okay.

1123
00:59:24,941 --> 00:59:29,310
Why is she running?

1124
00:59:29,346 --> 00:59:31,974
Well, someone's
chasing her.

1125
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:34,313
Why is he chasing her?

1126
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:36,512
I'm not sure.

1127
00:59:36,553 --> 00:59:38,180
Well, who is he?

1128
00:59:38,221 --> 00:59:40,382
I don't know.
We have to watch.

1129
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:42,721
- You have to stop talking.
- Mm.

1130
00:59:42,759 --> 00:59:44,727
Don't you hate
what she's wearing?

1131
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:47,559
Running out there
with bare feet and, what is that,

1132
00:59:47,597 --> 00:59:49,895
a pajama top?
It's so unrealistic.

1133
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:52,868
I once did a whole segment
on nighttime television.

1134
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:55,394
You would not believe

1135
00:59:55,438 --> 00:59:57,838
how much the demographics
influence the networks.

1136
00:59:57,874 --> 01:00:01,071
I mean it's just ridiculous.
All they care about is the bottom line.

1137
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:03,204
Oh, it's so nice just to sit
with family and do nothing, huh?

1138
01:00:03,246 --> 01:00:06,079
Don't even need to talk.
It's wonderful.

1139
01:00:06,116 --> 01:00:08,311
I miss so much
being a working mom.

1140
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:10,251
I used to bring Kevin,
though, to the set.

1141
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:12,221
That's where he met
Gore Vidal and Jackie Chan.

1142
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:13,847
Is there anybody famous
in this movie?

1143
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,414
Because I don't know
any of them.

1144
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:17,153
And they all look
the same... all the girls

1145
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:19,559
have the same body,
all the boys have the same hair.

1146
01:00:19,596 --> 01:00:22,224
...so many beautiful people
who live in Los Angeles?

1147
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:25,166
I think all the beautiful genes
ended up in California.

1148
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:28,432
Why is he kissing her?
It's beyond me.

1149
01:00:45,922 --> 01:00:50,018
I'm sorry. I thought
it was air freshener.

1150
01:00:59,469 --> 01:01:02,131
- Charlie?
- Dr. Batel's office.

1151
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:05,300
Miss Reynolds?

1152
01:01:05,342 --> 01:01:07,310
Hi.

1153
01:01:07,344 --> 01:01:09,141
Yeah.

1154
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:11,511
Nope. Okay.

1155
01:01:11,548 --> 01:01:13,743
Bye.

1156
01:01:15,885 --> 01:01:19,514
Oh God. I-I'm sorry.

1157
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:21,888
You know what?
That's probably my fault.

1158
01:01:21,925 --> 01:01:24,621
I mean,
I never thought she'd...

1159
01:01:24,661 --> 01:01:26,686
I mean, she's a little
eccentric, you know?

1160
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:29,426
- I'm sorry.
- Well, It doesn't matter.

1161
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:32,833
I don't want to talk about your mom
tonight. I want to talk about us.

1162
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:36,168
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

1163
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:39,972
Especially now
when I'm in the tub...

1164
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:43,138
naked and wet...

1165
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:45,147
and naked.

1166
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:47,979
Really?

1167
01:01:48,018 --> 01:01:50,145
Well, do you know what I would do
to you if I was there?

1168
01:01:50,186 --> 01:01:51,847
- What?
- Well, for starters...

1169
01:01:51,888 --> 01:01:53,651
Charlie!

1170
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:55,624
- I'm not looking. I'm not looking.
- Hello?

1171
01:01:55,658 --> 01:01:57,819
- I just wanted to return your shampoo.
- Your mom just walked in.

1172
01:01:57,861 --> 01:02:00,659
You really should use a shampoo
that doesn't dry your hair so much.

1173
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:03,188
We don't want a bride
with straw under her veil.

1174
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:05,201
- Oh, is that Kevin?
- Yeah, it is.

1175
01:02:05,235 --> 01:02:07,703
- Honey, your mom wants to talk to you.
- Sweetie, hi.

1176
01:02:07,737 --> 01:02:11,195
- Hi, Mom.
- Honey, I can't thank you both enough.

1177
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:15,177
- Of course.
- I'm having the most wonderful time.

1178
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:17,645
- How's Charlie?
- Oh, she's been a doll.

1179
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,841
We've been girlfriends
all week.

1180
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:22,818
- Great.
- I'm gonna be sad to go home.

1181
01:02:22,852 --> 01:02:26,811
You do? Well, you never know
what the future's gonna bring right?

1182
01:02:26,856 --> 01:02:28,790
I mean, I do love
this neighborhood.

1183
01:02:28,825 --> 01:02:30,383
In fact, you know,
two doors down,

1184
01:02:30,427 --> 01:02:32,452
there's this house
for sale.

1185
01:02:32,495 --> 01:02:34,463
It's got two
big bay windows

1186
01:02:34,497 --> 01:02:36,294
and a great rose garden.

1187
01:02:36,332 --> 01:02:38,300
You know how
I love rose gardens.

1188
01:02:38,334 --> 01:02:40,825
And basically,
it's got my name all over it.

1189
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:42,838
I'm having my...
my... um...

1190
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:44,840
real estate guy
look into it.

1191
01:02:44,908 --> 01:02:46,569
She's buying a house here?

1192
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:48,440
Two doors away.

1193
01:02:48,478 --> 01:02:51,504
"Lovely property.
Beautiful bay windows."

1194
01:02:51,548 --> 01:02:53,516
It's bullshit!

1195
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:55,745
She doesn't even like
this neighborhood.

1196
01:02:55,785 --> 01:02:58,049
Oh God, I'm so exhausted.

1197
01:02:58,088 --> 01:03:00,079
She's driving me insane!

1198
01:03:00,123 --> 01:03:03,388
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can!

1199
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:06,327
Stop being
such a big baby.

1200
01:03:06,362 --> 01:03:08,762
Kevin is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

1201
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,063
Charlie, do not
give up on this one.

1202
01:03:12,102 --> 01:03:14,070
It seems Mommy Dearest
has been keeping

1203
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:16,937
a very close eye on you,
sweetie.

1204
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:19,840
What are you talking about?
What are you doing in her clothes?

1205
01:03:19,876 --> 01:03:23,334
I was just upstairs in her room
minding my own business.

1206
01:03:23,379 --> 01:03:26,075
And I found all of this
in her closet.

1207
01:03:26,116 --> 01:03:28,641
She's been
investigating you.

1208
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:30,346
Whoa.

1209
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:32,650
Why does she have
your high school transcripts?

1210
01:03:32,689 --> 01:03:34,156
I know.

1211
01:03:35,892 --> 01:03:38,360
There's a picture of me
at the beach?!

1212
01:03:38,394 --> 01:03:40,021
- Yes, it is.
- I can't believe that.

1213
01:03:40,063 --> 01:03:42,190
There's another picture
of you in here.

1214
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:43,529
And it's... look.

1215
01:03:43,566 --> 01:03:45,124
Look at that.
It's like a closeup.

1216
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:47,693
But you have to be close
to take that, right?

1217
01:03:47,737 --> 01:03:49,637
Look at all this Gucci!

1218
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:52,607
It's just
Gucci Gucci Gucci!

1219
01:03:52,642 --> 01:03:55,736
She has skin caviar.
This stuff sells for $400 a jar.

1220
01:03:55,778 --> 01:03:57,746
- I've heard of that. I want a try.
- Here.

1221
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,748
- Mm.
- Doesn't that smell good?

1222
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:01,750
Ooh, hello.

1223
01:04:01,784 --> 01:04:03,809
What are these?

1224
01:04:03,853 --> 01:04:06,219
Those are
just her anti-anxiety pills.

1225
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:08,622
- Ooh, these are good.
- Really?

1226
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:11,058
They'd knock out a horse.
I have these at home.

1227
01:04:11,094 --> 01:04:13,187
- You do?
- Wait

1228
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:16,630
I don't know what these are.
But they're definitely not what I take.

1229
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:18,463
They smell like
oranges or something.

1230
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:19,832
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1231
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:22,133
Let me see.

1232
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:27,872
Hi, Andy.
It's Charlie.

1233
01:04:27,911 --> 01:04:30,880
Now, I'm not working
for Dr. Batel's office this week.

1234
01:04:30,914 --> 01:04:34,111
But I had a question.
Yeah, about some pills.

1235
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,777
Can I stop by?

1236
01:04:35,818 --> 01:04:38,309
Charlie, I'm having
a bit of a bad day,

1237
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:40,982
so Ruby's gonna take me
to see Dr. Chamberlain.

1238
01:04:41,024 --> 01:04:43,788
Okay!
You take care!

1239
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,824
Let's see
what you're up to.

1240
01:04:55,305 --> 01:04:57,364
- There you go.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

1241
01:04:57,407 --> 01:04:59,875
- And thank you.
- Wear that, sister.

1242
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:02,878
Okay, now Cartier
is one right down.

1243
01:05:02,912 --> 01:05:04,209
- Where's Niketown?
- What?

1244
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:06,215
- Niketown.
- Niketown?

1245
01:05:06,249 --> 01:05:08,240
Bad day, my ass.

1246
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:22,126
Wait a minute.

1247
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:24,963
Dr. Chamberlain?

1248
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:27,629
All right.

1249
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,067
Hello?

1250
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:34,076
Hey, Andy.

1251
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:37,546
What are they?

1252
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:40,481
Chewable vitamin Cs, huh?

1253
01:05:40,516 --> 01:05:42,814
Okay, thanks.

1254
01:05:51,194 --> 01:05:53,719
I know. I can't believe
the wedding's only a week away.

1255
01:05:54,998 --> 01:05:57,558
No, we do the final
walk-through on Monday.

1256
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,160
Oh! Wait a minute.
I think I hear her car.

1257
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:05,403
Drop my stuff
at my house, okay?

1258
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:07,568
All right.
Look crazy.

1259
01:06:22,692 --> 01:06:24,455
Charlie!

1260
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:29,561
Ch-ch-ch...

1261
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,624
Ch-ch-ahh...
Charlie!

1262
01:06:31,668 --> 01:06:33,568
Oh, I had to bring him
home with me today.

1263
01:06:33,603 --> 01:06:35,867
He's harmless.

1264
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:37,930
Sit. No!

1265
01:06:37,974 --> 01:06:39,601
No. No.

1266
01:06:39,642 --> 01:06:41,872
No, Zorro! Sit!

1267
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:49,749
Is that expensive?

1268
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:53,954
It was.

1269
01:06:57,894 --> 01:06:59,361
Sorry!

1270
01:07:10,807 --> 01:07:12,297
Oh!

1271
01:07:14,777 --> 01:07:16,802
Charlie!

1272
01:07:18,948 --> 01:07:20,745
Bonus.

1273
01:07:22,118 --> 01:07:24,552
Good boy.
Come on.

1274
01:07:24,587 --> 01:07:26,282
Come on.

1275
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:32,589
Mmm.

1276
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:35,062
Hello, old friend.

1277
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:37,430
Viola!

1278
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:39,526
You can't mix alcohol
with your pills!

1279
01:07:41,137 --> 01:07:43,298
I'm a little upset

1280
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:45,307
as you can imagine.

1281
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:46,638
Well, I know that

1282
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:48,974
and I'm sorry,
but your doctor said

1283
01:07:49,011 --> 01:07:50,945
if you're feeling upset

1284
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:53,312
that you should take
your pills, not alcohol.

1285
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:56,512
So you relax.
I'll get them.

1286
01:07:59,922 --> 01:08:01,856
Shit.

1287
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:20,205
Here we go.

1288
01:08:20,243 --> 01:08:22,211
This will make
you feel better.

1289
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:24,076
Drink up.

1290
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,641
Now I hope you like
what I made.

1291
01:08:29,685 --> 01:08:32,051
It's one of my mother's
specialties.

1292
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:39,293
- What's that?
- Tripe.

1293
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:41,728
It's a delicacy.

1294
01:08:41,764 --> 01:08:43,254
Try it.

1295
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:51,130
It's like nothing
you've ever tasted.

1296
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:52,801
Trust me.

1297
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:00,010
So Kevin called.

1298
01:09:00,049 --> 01:09:01,949
He's coming home tomorrow.
I can't wait.

1299
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:03,611
I'm so excited.
I miss him so much.

1300
01:09:03,653 --> 01:09:06,315
I was thinking maybe the three of us
could go to lunch tomorrow.

1301
01:09:06,355 --> 01:09:08,323
What do you think?

1302
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:10,018
Yeah, I think it's
a great idea too.

1303
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:12,186
I'll make reservations.

1304
01:09:12,228 --> 01:09:14,423
It'll be so much fun.

1305
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:17,331
Don't you just love
being girlfriends?

1306
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:28,002
Night-night,
sleep tight.

1307
01:09:40,022 --> 01:09:42,582
And good morning
to you too.

1308
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:47,993
- Ruby, is that you?
- In here!

1309
01:09:51,067 --> 01:09:53,297
Oh my God.
Is she all right?

1310
01:09:53,336 --> 01:09:55,304
I thought she went
to bed.

1311
01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:57,431
I don't know.
I haven't seen her like this

1312
01:09:57,473 --> 01:09:59,441
since "The View"
won an Emmy.

1313
01:09:59,475 --> 01:10:01,636
I wish I could stay
and help

1314
01:10:01,677 --> 01:10:04,043
but I've got to go
pick up Kevin at the airport.

1315
01:10:08,117 --> 01:10:10,085
What?

1316
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:12,314
I underestimated you.

1317
01:10:12,355 --> 01:10:14,448
You don't need a gun.

1318
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:19,794
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1319
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:21,228
Mm-hm.

1320
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:26,561
Last call!

1321
01:10:30,573 --> 01:10:32,438
We'll see you
tomorrow night.

1322
01:10:32,475 --> 01:10:35,706
Uh, there's a reservation
under Fields, Kevin.

1323
01:10:35,745 --> 01:10:37,337
Yes, right this way.

1324
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,349
I'm so glad my mom and you
had a great week.

1325
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,647
We did. I learned
a lot about her.

1326
01:10:42,685 --> 01:10:44,414
So who's
the mystery guest?

1327
01:10:46,055 --> 01:10:48,353
Oh, surprise!

1328
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:51,417
I thought your office
said we were having lunch alone.

1329
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:54,054
Well, I hope you guys
forgive me. I just...

1330
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:56,223
I wanted to talk
to you and Kevin together.

1331
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:01,060
So how are you, Mom?

1332
01:11:01,103 --> 01:11:03,071
Fine.

1333
01:11:03,105 --> 01:11:06,973
Though I did have
a rather difficult night.

1334
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:10,069
Ooh, it was probably
that martini you had.

1335
01:11:10,112 --> 01:11:12,273
Mom, you're not supposed
to be drink alcohol

1336
01:11:12,315 --> 01:11:14,943
with those pills
you're taking.

1337
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:16,679
You know, the truth is

1338
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,812
I owe you an apology.

1339
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:22,051
You know, I was so insensitive
to your feelings

1340
01:11:22,091 --> 01:11:23,820
about wanting to help
with the wedding.

1341
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:26,123
Oh, it's ancient history.

1342
01:11:26,162 --> 01:11:28,892
A young bride doesn't want to hear
the opinions of an old widow.

1343
01:11:28,931 --> 01:11:30,694
No no,
that is not true.

1344
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:33,031
I mean, you're going
to be my mom soon.

1345
01:11:35,204 --> 01:11:37,866
And a grandma shortly
after, hopefully.

1346
01:11:40,643 --> 01:11:44,079
And I want you to know
that I will do anything it takes

1347
01:11:44,113 --> 01:11:46,809
to make this
relationship work.

1348
01:11:48,217 --> 01:11:50,344
That said...

1349
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:52,411
will you be my maid...

1350
01:11:52,455 --> 01:11:54,685
I mean, my matron
of honor?

1351
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:57,750
Charlie, that's...
that's amazing.

1352
01:11:57,793 --> 01:11:59,852
- Mom, what do you say?
- But, uh...

1353
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:02,159
Morgan is gonna be
your maid of honor.

1354
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:05,599
Oh no, she has graciously
relinquished her title to you.

1355
01:12:05,635 --> 01:12:08,627
And I had this
specially made up.

1356
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:11,572
A dress in your
favorite color... peach.

1357
01:12:12,842 --> 01:12:15,140
- Come on, open it.
- Well, that's...

1358
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:17,168
Char... ah.

1359
01:12:21,617 --> 01:12:23,949
I-I don't think I can.

1360
01:12:23,986 --> 01:12:26,011
Mom, I think
it's a great idea.

1361
01:12:26,055 --> 01:12:27,682
I just don't think
I'm up to it.

1362
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:29,850
I really don't. I've got
to talk to my doctor.

1363
01:12:29,892 --> 01:12:31,484
Oh, I called him.
Yeah!

1364
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:33,427
And he said he thought
it was a great idea.

1365
01:12:35,531 --> 01:12:37,556
- You called my psychiatrist?
- Mm-hmm.

1366
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,626
In fact, we had lunch
at The lvy.

1367
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:42,661
Well, anyway...

1368
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:46,072
he said, considering
this turning point in your life,

1369
01:12:46,108 --> 01:12:47,871
you know, losing
so much so suddenly,

1370
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,468
that being involved
in the future

1371
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:52,140
would be the best therapy
in the world for you right now.

1372
01:12:52,181 --> 01:12:55,241
Careful. You know
those are strong.

1373
01:12:55,284 --> 01:12:59,448
You know, we...
are your future.

1374
01:12:59,488 --> 01:13:01,979
And we want you
to be part of it.

1375
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:06,390
I can have a list of duties
for you tomorrow.

1376
01:13:06,429 --> 01:13:08,488
No.

1377
01:13:08,531 --> 01:13:11,261
M-mom... no, Mom.

1378
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,461
Mom, don't cry.

1379
01:13:13,502 --> 01:13:15,902
Here.

1380
01:13:18,507 --> 01:13:20,498
Charlie.

1381
01:13:22,178 --> 01:13:24,146
I didn't think
I would be this emotional.

1382
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,807
Mom, here.
Can I?

1383
01:13:25,848 --> 01:13:27,975
Oh, oh!

1384
01:13:28,017 --> 01:13:30,451
Oh, thank you, baby.
I love you.

1385
01:13:30,486 --> 01:13:32,613
- I love you too.
- I love you too!

1386
01:13:32,655 --> 01:13:35,180
I love you too, Mom.

1387
01:13:35,224 --> 01:13:38,455
Kevin, you know what? Why don't you
give your mom and I a moment alone?

1388
01:13:38,494 --> 01:13:40,121
Yes, of course.

1389
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:48,195
Just so you know,
the crying bits are getting old.

1390
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:51,070
Just so you know,
Kevin likes his girls thin.

1391
01:13:51,107 --> 01:13:53,337
Oh! Well,
I can always get liposuction.

1392
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:55,343
I've been meaning to ask.
Is it painful?

1393
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:57,777
That maid of honor bit.

1394
01:13:57,813 --> 01:13:59,610
Priceless!

1395
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:03,140
You know what they say? Keep your
friends close, keep your enemies closer.

1396
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:05,915
- Oh!
- Now you listen to me.

1397
01:14:05,955 --> 01:14:07,923
This is my game now.

1398
01:14:07,957 --> 01:14:11,085
You are going to tell Kevin that you
are not moving into our neighborhood,

1399
01:14:11,127 --> 01:14:13,755
and that you've decided
that you're feeling like it's time

1400
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:15,855
that you go on
with your own life!

1401
01:14:15,898 --> 01:14:18,423
You're moving out
of our house immediately.

1402
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:20,901
This is over!

1403
01:14:22,438 --> 01:14:23,928
Oh!

1404
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:28,239
This isn't over,
not even close, girlie!

1405
01:14:28,277 --> 01:14:29,744
Well, bring it on,
Grandma.

1406
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:34,114
That little bitch!

1407
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,516
Let's go someplace near
the ocean and drink lunch.

1408
01:14:38,387 --> 01:14:39,877
What?

1409
01:14:39,922 --> 01:14:41,446
You know exactly what.

1410
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:44,085
Move!

1411
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:45,855
Move! Move!

1412
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:48,727
What's wrong with you?

1413
01:14:48,764 --> 01:14:53,326
I am sick.
I am sick sick sick of your shit.

1414
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:55,803
And I when I'm not sick,
I'm tired.

1415
01:14:55,838 --> 01:14:58,102
I am sick and tired.

1416
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,267
What are you saying?

1417
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:02,777
Damn you
and your luggage!

1418
01:15:02,812 --> 01:15:05,246
Ruby, you're not going
to leave me too, are you?

1419
01:15:05,281 --> 01:15:08,045
No, I'm not leaving you!

1420
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,573
You old slut!

1421
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:12,948
Ruby!

1422
01:15:15,825 --> 01:15:18,760
- Ruby, please...
- Hey, you almost forgot your dress!

1423
01:15:18,794 --> 01:15:21,058
You'll have nothing
to wear to the wedding.

1424
01:15:21,096 --> 01:15:23,064
See you, Ruby!

1425
01:15:23,098 --> 01:15:25,430
Maybe we can get you
a matching bonnet.

1426
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:28,027
See you
at the rehearsal dinner!

1427
01:15:34,376 --> 01:15:35,968
Motherf...!

1428
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,720
So, how's the bride-to-be
holding up?

1429
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:50,156
Ooh, under the circumstances
I'd say mediocre. But she's tough.

1430
01:15:50,192 --> 01:15:52,353
Not as tough
as the old bird.

1431
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:55,022
- What does that mean?
- For your own safety,

1432
01:15:55,064 --> 01:15:59,433
make sure you know where
the emergency exits are at all times.

1433
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:04,039
Hey, are you
and my mom okay?

1434
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:07,167
Great. Yeah, I just have a little
of the pre-wedding nerves,

1435
01:16:07,209 --> 01:16:08,836
but everything's
under control.

1436
01:16:08,878 --> 01:16:10,869
Of course.

1437
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:15,851
Hello, everyone!

1438
01:16:15,885 --> 01:16:18,251
Welcome
to the rehearsal dinner.

1439
01:16:21,657 --> 01:16:23,887
- My God, she looks amazing.
- I know.

1440
01:16:23,926 --> 01:16:25,120
Oh!

1441
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,287
Father Tyson.

1442
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:29,797
Hello, Blaire.

1443
01:16:29,832 --> 01:16:32,027
Kit, how are you?

1444
01:16:32,067 --> 01:16:33,295
Hello, hello.

1445
01:16:33,335 --> 01:16:36,133
- Oh, you are Morgan.
- Yes.

1446
01:16:36,171 --> 01:16:39,038
I have heard so much about your delicious
catering service.

1447
01:16:39,074 --> 01:16:40,871
Oh! Oh, wow!

1448
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:44,311
I have a lot of friends.
You're going to be a busy girl.

1449
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:47,406
- And you're Remy.
- Yeah.

1450
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:50,714
I recognize you from all the wonderful
things Charlie's told me about you.

1451
01:16:50,753 --> 01:16:53,187
Wow. Well, Ms. Fields,
I have to say...

1452
01:16:53,222 --> 01:16:57,056
- Oh, call me Viola. Please, I insist.
- Viola.

1453
01:16:57,092 --> 01:17:00,220
- All right, I'm gonna go get a drink.
- Okay.

1454
01:17:00,262 --> 01:17:03,231
I'm such a huge fan.

1455
01:17:03,265 --> 01:17:06,325
- Oh, you...
- Oh, l...

1456
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:09,269
Well, mi casa, su casa.
Make yourself at home.

1457
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:12,763
- Thank you. Bye, Viola.
- Cheers.

1458
01:17:12,808 --> 01:17:14,833
- Goodbye.
- I like her a lot. Hi.

1459
01:17:14,877 --> 01:17:16,845
- Hey!
- Hi!

1460
01:17:16,879 --> 01:17:19,439
- You guys have a nice little chit-chat?
- Oh my God. She came over

1461
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:21,642
and started talking to us.
What did you want us to do?

1462
01:17:21,684 --> 01:17:23,311
- Ignore her?
- Yes!

1463
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:26,150
So then getting her autograph
would be completely out of the question?

1464
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:33,794
- Was that yes? 'Cause... okay.
- No.

1465
01:17:33,829 --> 01:17:36,593
So there I was sitting next
to the Sultan of Brunei

1466
01:17:36,632 --> 01:17:39,760
with Maureen Dowd,
Carrie Fisher and Snoop Dogg.

1467
01:17:39,802 --> 01:17:41,770
You know the story, Kevin.

1468
01:17:41,804 --> 01:17:43,829
I said to Snoop, "Snoop,
I think your lyrics

1469
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:46,807
are sometimes a little
sexist and unfair to women."

1470
01:17:46,842 --> 01:17:50,039
And the Sultan of Brunei said,
"Really? I have 114 wives

1471
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:52,172
and they're all
huge fans of the Dogg!"

1472
01:17:59,621 --> 01:18:01,452
Honey, would you see
who's at the door?

1473
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:02,479
Sure.

1474
01:18:04,693 --> 01:18:06,285
These are delicious, Viola.

1475
01:18:06,328 --> 01:18:08,296
Oh, Kit,
I'm glad you like it.

1476
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:10,230
Mm, yeah.

1477
01:18:10,265 --> 01:18:11,857
Look who's here.
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1478
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:15,233
Oh my God!
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1479
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:18,762
- Hi! Everybody, it's Dr. Chamberlain!
- Hi. Good evening.

1480
01:18:18,807 --> 01:18:21,401
- Thanks so much for inviting me.
- Oh, shit!

1481
01:18:21,443 --> 01:18:24,207
That's Dr. Chamberlain.
He's Viola's doctor.

1482
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:26,111
Oh, we're going to need
another place setting.

1483
01:18:26,148 --> 01:18:27,843
Oh, please,
let me get that.

1484
01:18:27,883 --> 01:18:30,181
- There's a chair in the living room.
- Sure.

1485
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:33,017
Scootch down, you guys.
Come on, make room.

1486
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:34,920
You guys move down.

1487
01:18:34,957 --> 01:18:36,925
Cheers. Thank you.

1488
01:18:36,959 --> 01:18:38,119
Who's he?

1489
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,357
It's Viola's therapist.
Move down, you guys!

1490
01:18:41,397 --> 01:18:44,366
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

1491
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,699
- Here's you chair, Doctor.
- Here. Have mine, too.

1492
01:18:47,736 --> 01:18:49,567
Hello.

1493
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:50,731
Hi.

1494
01:18:50,773 --> 01:18:52,764
- Hi.
- Hi.

1495
01:18:55,177 --> 01:18:56,667
I'll get it.

1496
01:18:56,712 --> 01:18:59,044
So you just got here?

1497
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:00,548
- Are you expecting anyone else?
- Huh-uh.

1498
01:19:00,582 --> 01:19:03,142
- Hello, everybody!
- Fiona!

1499
01:19:03,185 --> 01:19:05,244
I'm so glad to see you.

1500
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:08,017
I just couldn't resist
bringing the happy couple

1501
01:19:08,057 --> 01:19:10,025
a little gift.

1502
01:19:10,059 --> 01:19:13,290
That's great. I will
get you a place setting.

1503
01:19:13,328 --> 01:19:15,728
She's bringing a gift?
I think she is the gift.

1504
01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:17,789
What the hell
is she doing here?

1505
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:21,064
- How about some more wine, everyone?
- Yeah!

1506
01:19:21,103 --> 01:19:23,867
How much longer do we have to stay?
I have midterms tomorrow.

1507
01:19:23,906 --> 01:19:25,430
Shh.

1508
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:28,238
- Oh, I get it.
- No, baby, not now, okay?

1509
01:19:28,277 --> 01:19:30,302
It's not the time.

1510
01:19:30,345 --> 01:19:32,575
So, Dr. Chamberlain,

1511
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:35,344
tell us about med school.
Where did you do your residency?

1512
01:19:35,384 --> 01:19:37,750
Uh, now that's...
that's a long story.

1513
01:19:37,786 --> 01:19:39,344
I don't think your guests
want to hear that.

1514
01:19:39,388 --> 01:19:40,616
No, we really
want to know.

1515
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:42,556
I think we need
some more gravy.

1516
01:19:47,796 --> 01:19:49,764
What is going on?

1517
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:51,732
What are you doing?

1518
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:53,826
I'm behaving.

1519
01:19:53,869 --> 01:19:55,166
Viola, no!

1520
01:19:55,204 --> 01:19:57,695
You can't!
Charlie's allergic to nuts!

1521
01:19:57,739 --> 01:19:59,400
Give it to me!

1522
01:20:05,914 --> 01:20:08,041
Viola, you're crazy.

1523
01:20:12,988 --> 01:20:14,216
Oh, get up.

1524
01:20:14,256 --> 01:20:16,486
Put the gravy down
or I'm telling Kevin.

1525
01:20:17,559 --> 01:20:19,083
Yeah!

1526
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:23,164
What's the big deal?
So her face swells up...

1527
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:25,098
swells up a little.
So what?

1528
01:20:25,134 --> 01:20:28,228
Swells up a little? Her face'll
blow up like a Macy's Day balloon.

1529
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:30,568
Well, good. It'll match
the other body parts!

1530
01:20:30,606 --> 01:20:33,973
Viola, think about
what you're doing.

1531
01:20:34,009 --> 01:20:36,273
Come on, the girl's
getting married tomorrow!

1532
01:20:36,311 --> 01:20:37,972
Ruby, when did you
lose your edge?

1533
01:20:38,013 --> 01:20:39,640
Right after
you lost your mind.

1534
01:20:39,681 --> 01:20:41,911
Come on.

1535
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:43,542
All right. Okay.
No nuts.

1536
01:20:43,585 --> 01:20:45,075
Come on.

1537
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,486
Viola, I think you
dislocated my vagina.

1538
01:20:47,523 --> 01:20:49,491
- Where's the...
- Where's the what?

1539
01:20:49,525 --> 01:20:50,822
Gravy? More gravy?

1540
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:52,827
Anyone for more gravy?

1541
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:55,887
Oh, I am not
doing time for you!

1542
01:20:55,931 --> 01:20:58,024
- Where's the back door?
- Stay cool, Ruby!

1543
01:20:58,066 --> 01:20:59,590
Stay cool! This is no time
to lose your nerve.

1544
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:01,626
If I get arrested
I'm gonna sing like a canary.

1545
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:03,729
Maybe she won't
take any gravy.

1546
01:21:03,772 --> 01:21:05,967
- That's a lot of gravy.
- Mmm!

1547
01:21:06,008 --> 01:21:08,203
This gravy's delicious!

1548
01:21:09,344 --> 01:21:11,335
You... you gotta go
stop her!

1549
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:14,440
- Go on, stop her. Go stop her.
- You go, you go, you go.

1550
01:21:14,483 --> 01:21:16,280
Why me?
You're the culprit? You go!

1551
01:21:16,318 --> 01:21:18,946
- You're my assistant.
- What am I supposed to do?

1552
01:21:18,987 --> 01:21:20,716
Go out there and stick my finger
down her throat?

1553
01:21:20,756 --> 01:21:22,348
Yeah.

1554
01:21:23,692 --> 01:21:25,023
Baby, are you okay?

1555
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:27,426
Kevin, my tongue
feels weird.

1556
01:21:27,462 --> 01:21:29,054
I think
something's wrong!

1557
01:21:29,097 --> 01:21:30,826
Charlie, are you okay?

1558
01:21:30,866 --> 01:21:33,767
- What are we gonna do now?
- Hide the damn nuts!

1559
01:21:36,305 --> 01:21:38,432
- Are you all right?
- Get her some water.

1560
01:21:42,811 --> 01:21:45,507
Flat or sparkling?

1561
01:21:45,547 --> 01:21:48,175
The caterer says he doesn't know how
this could have happened.

1562
01:21:48,217 --> 01:21:51,311
Well, I feel like I ate
a loaf of nuts.

1563
01:21:51,353 --> 01:21:53,913
I mean, even my tongue
is swollen.

1564
01:21:55,624 --> 01:21:57,057
You're marrying
a big, fat, puffy tomato mouth.

1565
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:04,462
It's not that bad, really. Besides,
the swelling's already going down.

1566
01:22:04,499 --> 01:22:06,694
- Yeah?
- Hey, Kev.

1567
01:22:06,735 --> 01:22:08,327
- Yeah.
- Just coming to check up

1568
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:10,338
on the bride-to-be.
For the love of God...

1569
01:22:10,372 --> 01:22:12,602
- Out!
- You see?

1570
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:14,836
I told you it looks terrible.

1571
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:16,741
- I told you.
- Baby, I promise you.

1572
01:22:16,778 --> 01:22:19,269
In 24 hours the swelling
will be completely gone.

1573
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:21,111
Give me that!

1574
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:47,668
Door was open.

1575
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:50,735
Oh thank God.

1576
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:53,577
- The Bride of Frankenstein is gone.
- I know.

1577
01:22:53,615 --> 01:22:55,742
I was up half
the night worrying.

1578
01:22:55,784 --> 01:22:58,048
- You look great.
- I just don't know

1579
01:22:58,086 --> 01:23:00,145
- how those nuts got in there.
- Yeah.

1580
01:23:00,188 --> 01:23:02,816
Hmm.
Wait.

1581
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:04,416
Hey, do you think
she would...

1582
01:23:07,262 --> 01:23:08,957
No!

1583
01:23:08,997 --> 01:23:10,487
Come on.

1584
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:12,397
I mean, she's crazy,

1585
01:23:12,434 --> 01:23:14,732
but she's not like,
psycho-killer crazy.

1586
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:15,759
Hmm.

1587
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:19,564
No!

1588
01:23:21,009 --> 01:23:24,445
Oh, hey, I was wondering.
Could I bring a date

1589
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:26,447
to your wedding?

1590
01:23:26,481 --> 01:23:28,972
Of course. My God.
How exciting.

1591
01:23:29,017 --> 01:23:31,417
Great. Thanks.
So then, I'll see you later.

1592
01:23:31,453 --> 01:23:33,045
But... w-wait!

1593
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:35,215
- Who is he? Tell me!
- Oh, it's...

1594
01:23:35,257 --> 01:23:38,454
okay, don't be mad.
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1595
01:23:38,493 --> 01:23:40,461
Actually "Paul."

1596
01:23:40,495 --> 01:23:43,328
- Is that his real name?
- That's very funny.

1597
01:23:43,365 --> 01:23:45,333
I gotta go get a mani, pedi
and my eyebrows waxed.

1598
01:23:45,367 --> 01:23:48,097
But I'll see you in
a couple hours, okay?

1599
01:23:48,136 --> 01:23:49,501
- Oh, let me go down with you.
- Okay.

1600
01:23:49,538 --> 01:23:51,062
Oh God.

1601
01:23:56,812 --> 01:23:58,336
She added
even more ruffles!

1602
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,644
Where's your prom date,
senorita?

1603
01:24:02,651 --> 01:24:05,814
Oh, wait a minute. This is too
damn good. Where's my camera?

1604
01:24:05,854 --> 01:24:07,344
This is just too good.

1605
01:24:07,389 --> 01:24:10,290
Will you just get me
out of this right now?

1606
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:12,156
Come here.

1607
01:24:29,745 --> 01:24:31,542
- Cheers.
- Hey.

1608
01:24:33,415 --> 01:24:34,712
Thanks for coming.

1609
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,184
Okay, guys, let's go see
how Charlie's doing.

1610
01:24:37,219 --> 01:24:39,312
Ah, yes, please.

1611
01:24:39,354 --> 01:24:40,946
Uh-huh.

1612
01:24:40,989 --> 01:24:43,856
Oh my God. Those are
so much better than mine.

1613
01:24:50,031 --> 01:24:53,000
Don't... touch me!

1614
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:55,730
I got out of that car
the same way I got in it...

1615
01:24:55,771 --> 01:24:59,434
without you.
Now where is she?

1616
01:25:06,148 --> 01:25:08,116
You here with the bride
or the groom?

1617
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:10,118
I'm here with my mother.

1618
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:11,881
Oh.

1619
01:25:16,258 --> 01:25:17,748
She looked a lot older. I...

1620
01:25:21,296 --> 01:25:23,389
Well, look
what we have here.

1621
01:25:23,432 --> 01:25:25,423
Oh my God.

1622
01:25:26,635 --> 01:25:28,728
You look beautiful.
Oh my God.

1623
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:30,795
- Oh my God.
- This is it!

1624
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:32,739
Yeah!

1625
01:25:32,774 --> 01:25:35,174
- Oh God, did you talk to the priest?
- I talked to him.

1626
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:37,337
He's just going
to skip right over that whole

1627
01:25:37,379 --> 01:25:39,472
- "if anyone should object" part.
- Okay.

1628
01:25:39,514 --> 01:25:43,041
You're a vision in white,
sweetie, really.

1629
01:25:43,084 --> 01:25:46,679
Knock knock.
Look at you!

1630
01:25:46,721 --> 01:25:50,487
And so is your
mother-in-law.

1631
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:52,618
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

1632
01:25:53,762 --> 01:25:55,855
All right.
Everybody out.

1633
01:25:55,897 --> 01:25:58,058
Out.
Give the bride a moment.

1634
01:26:01,102 --> 01:26:03,866
- No way.
- What?

1635
01:26:09,478 --> 01:26:11,241
What is that?

1636
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:13,975
- What?
- Where's your bridesmaid's dress?

1637
01:26:14,015 --> 01:26:16,415
Oh, I gave it
to Ruby's daughter.

1638
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:18,385
She works at Hooters.
She was thrilled.

1639
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:20,479
I don't have a daughter?

1640
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:22,149
Oh.

1641
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:23,521
Rude.

1642
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,519
Take off that
white dress right now

1643
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:30,929
or I'll take it off
for you.

1644
01:26:30,966 --> 01:26:33,298
Don't you tell me
what to do!

1645
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:36,236
You did not
just poke me!

1646
01:26:36,271 --> 01:26:38,796
Don't you touch me,
you two-bit tramp!

1647
01:26:41,009 --> 01:26:43,000
Oh my God!
Viola, I'm so sorry.

1648
01:26:43,044 --> 01:26:45,672
I didn't mean to...

1649
01:26:45,714 --> 01:26:47,944
You don't go and slap somebody
then apologize.

1650
01:26:47,983 --> 01:26:49,541
Get some backbone!

1651
01:26:55,891 --> 01:26:58,086
God! This is crazy!

1652
01:26:58,126 --> 01:26:59,821
Why don't you just
face it?

1653
01:26:59,861 --> 01:27:02,295
I'm marrying Kevin today and there's
nothing you can do about it.

1654
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:05,356
You face it! You'll never be
good enough for him!

1655
01:27:05,467 --> 01:27:08,095
Didn't stop you
from marrying my son.

1656
01:27:08,136 --> 01:27:11,697
- Oh God, no.
- Well, look at you.

1657
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:13,708
All in white.

1658
01:27:13,742 --> 01:27:16,302
You are so predictable.

1659
01:27:16,344 --> 01:27:19,142
Oh, Gertrude.
I didn't know you were coming.

1660
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:20,408
You didn't?

1661
01:27:20,448 --> 01:27:23,440
Wonder why.
Oh, I know.

1662
01:27:23,485 --> 01:27:26,318
You didn't send me
an invitation!

1663
01:27:26,354 --> 01:27:27,787
I thought you
were dead.

1664
01:27:27,822 --> 01:27:29,813
But evil doesn't die
so easily.

1665
01:27:29,858 --> 01:27:32,793
I heard you got sacked
and thrown into a loony bin.

1666
01:27:32,827 --> 01:27:35,125
- Oh! Oh!
- My congratulations.

1667
01:27:35,163 --> 01:27:36,994
Oh my God.

1668
01:27:37,032 --> 01:27:39,000
Oh my God!

1669
01:27:39,034 --> 01:27:40,968
These hors d'oeuvres
taste like old socks.

1670
01:27:43,271 --> 01:27:45,205
Now, I want to get

1671
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,367
an up-close look
at the bride.

1672
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:49,036
Holy Toledo!

1673
01:27:49,077 --> 01:27:52,171
You are a stunner!

1674
01:27:52,213 --> 01:27:54,374
My grandson
is a lucky fellah.

1675
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:55,713
Look, what he did.

1676
01:27:55,750 --> 01:28:00,346
He went out and found
himself an exotic Latina!

1677
01:28:01,656 --> 01:28:03,783
Would that my son
had been that lucky.

1678
01:28:03,825 --> 01:28:05,520
Here we go again.

1679
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,620
What? You were
a television weatherwoman

1680
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:09,960
in Dubuque, Montana.

1681
01:28:09,998 --> 01:28:12,398
You drove around
in a broken-down minivan

1682
01:28:12,434 --> 01:28:15,733
and you drank red wine
from a box!

1683
01:28:18,506 --> 01:28:19,905
Classy.

1684
01:28:19,941 --> 01:28:21,909
You killed him,
you know?

1685
01:28:21,943 --> 01:28:23,911
- What?!
- You killed him.

1686
01:28:23,945 --> 01:28:25,913
All the doctors agreed,

1687
01:28:25,947 --> 01:28:29,474
my son died
of terminal disappointment!

1688
01:28:29,517 --> 01:28:31,644
If anybody killed him,
you did.

1689
01:28:31,686 --> 01:28:33,449
You smothered him
to death!

1690
01:28:33,488 --> 01:28:35,251
Nobody was ever
good enough for him!

1691
01:28:37,325 --> 01:28:39,316
My God, you look old!

1692
01:28:41,096 --> 01:28:42,723
Fine.

1693
01:28:42,764 --> 01:28:45,665
This woman is going
to drive me insane.

1694
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:49,101
Now, I'd rather not
take all the credit.

1695
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:54,431
You'll get over it.

1696
01:28:57,112 --> 01:28:59,444
- Okay, I love you.
- You're kidding.

1697
01:29:13,028 --> 01:29:15,588
This is never gonna end, is it?

1698
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:18,997
I mean, that's going
to be me and you in 30 years.

1699
01:29:19,034 --> 01:29:22,197
We'll be doing
the exact same thing.

1700
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,131
You know what?

1701
01:29:28,943 --> 01:29:32,379
I wanted to marry Kevin
because we make each other happy.

1702
01:29:32,414 --> 01:29:35,406
But you're never gonna
let that happen.

1703
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:37,441
Are you?

1704
01:29:39,821 --> 01:29:42,722
Oh my God.
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1705
01:29:47,629 --> 01:29:49,824
You win, Viola.

1706
01:29:51,232 --> 01:29:53,200
What do you mean?

1707
01:29:53,234 --> 01:29:54,758
The wedding's off.

1708
01:29:56,404 --> 01:29:58,395
Bye, Ruby.

1709
01:30:01,476 --> 01:30:04,343
I-I cannot believe
she compared me to Gertrude.

1710
01:30:04,379 --> 01:30:07,348
I know.
Now that's just wrong.

1711
01:30:07,382 --> 01:30:10,010
- Thank you.
- You are far worse.

1712
01:30:10,051 --> 01:30:13,350
I don't recall Gertrude
ever trying to poison you.

1713
01:30:13,388 --> 01:30:15,856
And I'm pretty sure
she wore black to your wedding.

1714
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:18,188
Black. Yeah, she said
she was in mourning.

1715
01:30:18,226 --> 01:30:20,091
Mm-hmm.

1716
01:30:20,128 --> 01:30:22,756
I just want my son
to be happy.

1717
01:30:22,797 --> 01:30:25,823
Whatever made you
think he wasn't?

1718
01:30:34,642 --> 01:30:36,633
Hey, what are you
doing here?

1719
01:30:36,678 --> 01:30:39,408
Don't you know it's
bad luck to see the...

1720
01:30:39,447 --> 01:30:41,438
Charlie, what's wrong?

1721
01:30:43,985 --> 01:30:45,782
What is it?

1722
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:47,412
Are you nervous?

1723
01:30:47,455 --> 01:30:49,252
Hey.

1724
01:30:51,593 --> 01:30:53,754
- Kevin, I need...
- Charlie,

1725
01:30:53,795 --> 01:30:55,820
I need to talk to you.

1726
01:30:55,864 --> 01:30:58,856
- Viola, stop it!
- It's the flower girls.

1727
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:01,926
- They're drunk again.
- What?

1728
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:03,631
Yeah, in the toilet.

1729
01:31:03,671 --> 01:31:05,332
Not now, Viola, okay?

1730
01:31:05,373 --> 01:31:07,068
It's really important.

1731
01:31:07,108 --> 01:31:09,269
Just give us a minute.
She'll be right there.

1732
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:13,247
Please?

1733
01:31:13,281 --> 01:31:15,272
Charlie, what is it?

1734
01:31:19,754 --> 01:31:21,688
I'll be right back.

1735
01:31:27,028 --> 01:31:29,019
What do you want, Viola?

1736
01:31:30,832 --> 01:31:33,357
I don't want you
to walk out on this wedding.

1737
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:34,959
You don't?

1738
01:31:35,003 --> 01:31:37,301
No, I don't.

1739
01:31:37,338 --> 01:31:39,966
What, am I supposed to believe
that you've had some epiphany?

1740
01:31:40,008 --> 01:31:42,568
That all of the sudden,
everything is going to be different?

1741
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:44,601
It's never been
about you, Charlie.

1742
01:31:44,646 --> 01:31:46,546
It's me.

1743
01:31:46,581 --> 01:31:48,515
I've been so afraid
of losing him.

1744
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,882
He's the only family
I've got.

1745
01:31:50,919 --> 01:31:55,379
This is my chance
for a family, too.

1746
01:31:55,423 --> 01:31:57,414
- And I'm scared.
- Oh!

1747
01:31:57,458 --> 01:31:59,824
Don't blow your chance
for happiness.

1748
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:01,761
You've never needed
my approval.

1749
01:32:01,796 --> 01:32:04,060
He's loved you
from the very beginning.

1750
01:32:05,366 --> 01:32:08,335
And I promise I will
get out of the way

1751
01:32:08,369 --> 01:32:09,836
and let the two of you
be happy.

1752
01:32:09,871 --> 01:32:12,032
That's not what I want.

1753
01:32:12,073 --> 01:32:15,531
I mean, there just has
to be some boundaries, Viola.

1754
01:32:15,577 --> 01:32:16,908
I can do boundaries!

1755
01:32:18,546 --> 01:32:21,845
I don't love boundaries
but I can do them.

1756
01:32:21,883 --> 01:32:25,250
How about the number of times
you call Kevin a day?

1757
01:32:25,286 --> 01:32:27,413
Can we limit that
to, like, one?

1758
01:32:27,455 --> 01:32:30,549
Oh, I need at least
four minimum.

1759
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,856
- He's 35 years old.
- Three?

1760
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:34,919
- Two.
- Deal.

1761
01:32:34,963 --> 01:32:37,989
Two long-ass calls!

1762
01:32:38,032 --> 01:32:40,125
When Kevin and I
have kids,

1763
01:32:40,168 --> 01:32:42,398
he and I will decide
how they're raised.

1764
01:32:42,437 --> 01:32:45,565
All right. But you know I have
raised one wonderful boy.

1765
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:48,303
- And my advice could be very...
- Will be solicited when needed.

1766
01:32:48,343 --> 01:32:51,278
All right, as long as one kid
is named after me.

1767
01:32:51,312 --> 01:32:54,213
- Middle name.
- Deal.

1768
01:32:54,249 --> 01:32:55,682
What else?

1769
01:32:55,717 --> 01:32:58,208
Holidays
and special occasions.

1770
01:32:58,253 --> 01:33:00,619
Are you gonna keep
me away?

1771
01:33:00,655 --> 01:33:04,921
You must be present
for every Christmas,

1772
01:33:04,959 --> 01:33:08,395
Thanksgiving,
birthday,

1773
01:33:08,429 --> 01:33:11,489
school play,
clarinet recital

1774
01:33:11,532 --> 01:33:14,899
and soccer game
in our kids' lives.

1775
01:33:16,137 --> 01:33:18,662
I want you to love them
and spoil them

1776
01:33:18,706 --> 01:33:21,038
and teach them things
that Kevin and I can't.

1777
01:33:22,277 --> 01:33:24,211
Like how to throw
a right hook for example.

1778
01:33:27,815 --> 01:33:29,783
I want you there, Viola.

1779
01:33:29,817 --> 01:33:32,877
I do, up front and center.

1780
01:33:34,756 --> 01:33:37,748
From this point
I will not negotiate.

1781
01:33:37,792 --> 01:33:41,387
Damn. That girl can give
a nice little speech.

1782
01:33:43,131 --> 01:33:44,655
Deal?

1783
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:47,893
Oh...

1784
01:33:47,936 --> 01:33:50,530
can they call me "Aunt Viola"
instead of "Grandma"?

1785
01:33:50,571 --> 01:33:53,233
Fine.

1786
01:34:03,117 --> 01:34:05,517
Come on, unzip me.

1787
01:34:05,553 --> 01:34:08,215
Viola, you don't
have to wear that dress, really.

1788
01:34:09,223 --> 01:34:11,316
Yes, I do. Really.

1789
01:34:15,964 --> 01:34:18,364
Go, Kevin and Charlie!

1790
01:34:24,539 --> 01:34:25,528
Yeah!

1791
01:34:41,389 --> 01:34:44,722
Mom!

1792
01:34:44,759 --> 01:34:46,624
Do you really think I would leave without
saying goodbye?

1793
01:34:49,063 --> 01:34:51,190
I love you, Mom.

1794
01:34:51,232 --> 01:34:53,632
- Thanks for everything.
- Go.

1795
01:34:54,869 --> 01:34:56,427
Bye, you guys!

1796
01:34:58,506 --> 01:35:01,236
Okay, everybody gather around
the back of the car!

1797
01:35:02,243 --> 01:35:04,268
Charlie!

1798
01:35:04,312 --> 01:35:06,610
Charlie, right here!
Right here, Charlie!

1799
01:35:25,633 --> 01:35:27,533
Sheesh.

1800
01:35:27,568 --> 01:35:30,901
- Oh, Hawaii! I cannot wait!
- I know. I can't either.

1801
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:34,406
Have a great
time in Hawaii!

1802
01:35:34,442 --> 01:35:36,535
- Good luck!
- Have fun in Hawaii!

1803
01:35:40,882 --> 01:35:43,043
Just you and me
now, Ruby!

1804
01:35:43,084 --> 01:35:47,248
Jesus. Who did I kill
in a past life?

1805
01:35:47,288 --> 01:35:49,586
And take off
that damn dress.

1806
01:35:49,624 --> 01:35:51,182
You look like
a giant peach cobbler.

1807
01:35:51,225 --> 01:35:53,159
You're making me hungry.

1808
01:35:53,194 --> 01:35:56,322
Come on, weathergirl,
I'll buy you a box of wine.

1809
01:36:01,169 --> 01:36:03,467
# For once in my life #

1810
01:36:03,838 --> 01:36:06,966
# I have someone
who needs me #

1811
01:36:07,008 --> 01:36:10,842
# Someone I needed
so long #

1812
01:36:10,878 --> 01:36:12,903
# For once, unafraid #

1813
01:36:12,947 --> 01:36:15,973
# I can go
where life leads me #

1814
01:36:16,017 --> 01:36:19,748
# Somehow I know
I'll be strong #

1815
01:36:19,787 --> 01:36:21,482
# For once, I can touch #

1816
01:36:21,522 --> 01:36:24,650
# What my heart
used to dream of #

1817
01:36:24,692 --> 01:36:28,423
# Long before I knew #

1818
01:36:28,463 --> 01:36:32,923
# Oh, someone warm
like you #

1819
01:36:32,967 --> 01:36:35,663
# Would make my dream
come true #

1820
01:36:35,703 --> 01:36:37,762
- # Yeah yeah yeah #
- # For once in our lives #

1821
01:36:37,805 --> 01:36:39,636
# For once in my life #

1822
01:36:39,674 --> 01:36:42,040
# I won't let sorrow
hurt me #

1823
01:36:42,076 --> 01:36:44,476
# Not like it's hurt me
before #

1824
01:36:44,512 --> 01:36:46,480
# Not like
it's hurt before #

1825
01:36:46,514 --> 01:36:48,482
# For once,
I have something #

1826
01:36:48,516 --> 01:36:51,076
# I know won't
desert me #

1827
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:55,283
- # I'm not alone anymore #
- # I'm not alone #

1828
01:36:55,323 --> 01:36:57,291
# For once, I can say #

1829
01:36:57,325 --> 01:36:59,691
# "This is mine,
you can't take it" #

1830
01:36:59,727 --> 01:37:03,720
# As long as I know
I have love I can make it #

1831
01:37:03,764 --> 01:37:05,925
# For once in my life #

1832
01:37:05,967 --> 01:37:08,868
# I have someone
who needs me #

1833
01:37:08,903 --> 01:37:11,303
# Someone who needs me #

1834
01:37:11,339 --> 01:37:13,239
# Ah-hah-hah,
hey yeah! #

1835
01:37:13,274 --> 01:37:15,902
# Someone who needs me #

1836
01:37:15,943 --> 01:37:17,808
# All I need
is love, baby #

1837
01:37:25,186 --> 01:37:27,177
# For once in my life #

1838
01:37:50,044 --> 01:37:52,706
# Make our dreams
come true #

1839
01:37:52,747 --> 01:37:54,942
- # For once in my life #
- # For once in my life #

1840
01:37:54,982 --> 01:37:57,576
# I won't let
sorrow hurt me #

1841
01:37:57,618 --> 01:38:01,019
- # Not like it's hurt me before #
- # Not like it hurt before #

1842
01:38:01,055 --> 01:38:03,148
# For once, I have something #

1843
01:38:03,191 --> 01:38:06,160
# I know won't desert me #

1844
01:38:06,194 --> 01:38:09,925
- # I'm not alone anymore #
- # I'm not alone anymore #

1845
01:38:09,964 --> 01:38:11,932
# For once I can say #

1846
01:38:11,966 --> 01:38:14,457
# "This is mine,
you can't take it" #

1847
01:38:14,502 --> 01:38:18,404
# Long as I know
I have love I can make it #

1848
01:38:18,439 --> 01:38:20,498
# For once in my life #

1849
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:23,840
# I have someone
who needs me #

1850
01:38:23,878 --> 01:38:26,108
- # Someone who needs me #
- # Oh #

1851
01:38:26,147 --> 01:38:27,978
# For once in my life #

1852
01:38:28,015 --> 01:38:30,415
- # Someone who needs me #
- # Yeah #

1853
01:38:30,451 --> 01:38:32,316
# Somebody that needs me #

1854
01:38:32,353 --> 01:38:35,345
- # Someone who needs me #
- # For once in my life #

1855
01:38:44,398 --> 01:38:48,732
# You can cry
a million tears #

1856
01:38:48,769 --> 01:38:53,468
# You can wait
a million years #

1857
01:38:53,507 --> 01:38:58,774
# If you think that time
will change your ways #

1858
01:38:58,813 --> 01:39:02,840
# Don't wait too long #

1859
01:39:02,883 --> 01:39:07,149
# When your morning
turns to night #

1860
01:39:07,188 --> 01:39:11,147
# Who'll be loving you
by candlelight? #

1861
01:39:11,192 --> 01:39:16,892
# If you think that time
will change your ways #

1862
01:39:16,931 --> 01:39:20,890
# Don't wait too long #

1863
01:39:20,935 --> 01:39:25,804
# Maybe I've got a lot
to learn #

1864
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,308
# Time can slip away #

1865
01:39:30,311 --> 01:39:34,270
# Sometimes you've got
to lose it all #

1866
01:39:34,315 --> 01:39:37,375
# Before you find
your way #

1867
01:39:39,787 --> 01:39:43,416
# Take a chance
and play your part #

1868
01:39:43,457 --> 01:39:48,087
# Make romance,
it might break your heart #

1869
01:39:48,129 --> 01:39:53,795
# But if you think time
will change your ways #

1870
01:39:53,834 --> 01:39:56,803
# Don't wait too long #

1871
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:19,748
# Baby, you and I've got
a lot to learn #

1872
01:40:19,794 --> 01:40:23,491
# Don't want to waste
another day #

1873
01:40:25,299 --> 01:40:29,099
# Maybe you got
to lose it all #

1874
01:40:29,136 --> 01:40:33,766
# Before you find
your way #

1875
01:40:33,808 --> 01:40:38,108
# Take a chance,

# Make romance,
it might break your heart #

# Don't wait too long #

1879
01:40:53,627 --> 01:40:55,891
# Don't wait #
