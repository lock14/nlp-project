Since the keeping of time, who hasn't
longed to shift the hands of the clock back?
Maybe to a general era,
maybe to a specific moment
to just before it all
started to slip away.
Now, my time machine cannot
place you on that one day.
It cannot find for you
the critical moment,
the nexus of the tragic flow,
but it can transport you
back to a time
when the blood ran hot
in your veins
and your sleep
was deep in dreams.
- What?
- Honey.
Now, my time machine can
give you all this,
and for half the price
of a conventional mattress.
- Jesus.
- Honey.
Hang in there, little man.
The grownups are talking.
Now this is the gold standard.
Our platinum line.
- Mom, I don't want a futon.
- It's a cotton mattress, tenderfoot.
Let me save you a lot of
heartache over the next 20 years.
Wanting's got nothing
to do with it.
When I was your age,
I wanted to be a fire truck.
Yeah? And I want
a real bed.
Yeah, and I wanted a wife that
didn't sleep with other men.
- What?
- If "ifs" and "buts" were candy and nuts,
every day would be Christmas, and the
both of us would be banging supermodels.
- You follow my thread, cupcake?
- That's it. We're leaving.
What?
Shit.
And why does he
need a real bed?
It's gonna be another 15 years before
he knows how to properly fuck on it.
You know what it is?
I'll tell you what it is.
It's the glorification
of youth.
And you say,
"Bob, so what?
So what if we're
a culture of youth worship?"
Well, say I, consider the Hitler Youth.
Or the Khmer Rouge.
- Can I get a witness on this? Smiley.
- I am nothing if not a witness.
And what do the young
know about anything anyway?
Not one thing.
Brewer, what did you know
when you were 20?
- Not one thing.
- And now?
- Everything.
- Defense rests.
Might as well
glorify cardboard.
Glorify sand.
It's all the same thing.
Present company
excepted, honey.
I hope Smiley
carded you.
I'm 23.
Uh-huh.
And I'm Cab Calloway.
Welcome to
The Cotton Club.
Tall,
tan, and terrific.
Hey, uh, don't you
usually come in here
with a big guy,
what's his name?
- Adam.
- Yeah, Adam.
Hmm. Where's he tonight?
Well, I got
about 20 minutes.
Slide down here and tell me the
story of your very young life.
Ahh...
Share the sidewalk,
asshole!
It's not a weapon, lady!
Hi, my name is Bob.
Hi, Bob.
It's been 30 seconds
since my last drink.
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye.
Ms. Funk, there's
a woman here to see you.
- What now?
- I think it's about Bob.
Yeah, that--
that door's a push.
Thank you.
- You all right there?
- Yeah, fine.
- Push, pull, pull, push.
- Yeah. Very confusing.
Yeah.
Have a great day.
Huh? Yeah.
Yeah, you, too.
Fifty percent off
anything on the floor.
Sure.
Glad to see you
back with us.
That 50 percent is coming off
your commission this month.
If you even have any.
Did you actually tell
that woman about Theresa?
Theresa? What?
What about her?
She said you were talking
about your cheating ex-wife.
What? No.
Uh, listen, can we...
can we talk about this later?
Robert, tomorrow morning,
8:30 sharp, my office.
- 8:30. Sharp!
- Yeah.
Ahh...
Come on!
Like clockwork.
Morning, Bob.
- Hey, Bob, are you a friend of Bill's?
- I got enough friends.
Name one.
It's very, very sexy.
So, who is the guy?
Friend of a friend.
He owns a dozen doughnut shops.
Huh. It's funny.
Well, anyway, I should
get to the office, so...
Good luck tonight.
- Thanks for the sweater, hon.
- Absolutely.
- What time is it?
- Quarter past 9:00.
I told him.
8:30 a.m., sharp.
This is where
the magic happens.
Jean, Sonny,
Ms. Thorne.
- How you doing?
- I'm done.
Nice to meet you.
She knows.
That's how it goes.
Funk Foam and Futon. Please hold.
Oh, hold the elevator.
- Hey, who's that?
- Oh, that's the new kid.
She's pretty, huh?
I think she's being
groomed to replace you, Bob.
I'll probably have to use
a coach for the accent.
...Canterbury Tales
and Don Quix-- Don Quix--
Hi, Bob. I was just saying that I might
get to do the lead in this play.
I was telling her
it was kind of a cross between
Canterbury Tales
and Don Quixote.
It's a real brainy,
very brainy, very,
you know, very old-timey.
I'll probably have to use a coach for the--
to do the accents and--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
This is Ms. Thorne.
This is Mr. Funk.
- Ms. Thorne.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
You got a--
- Yeah.
- I don't wanna--
- Now, no-- Uh-- Just let me--
- Um... Oh, okay.
- Let me-- Oh.
- Thank you.
- Ow. I'm sorry, sorry.
- Ow, thank you.
- Thank you.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Here you go.
- There you--
- Hey, thanks.
So, it's really
old-timey stuff because--
I, um-- Anyway, I--
Back to the salt mines, 'cause I gotta--
It was nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you,Steve.
Good luck today.
So...
Ms. Thorne.
Ruthie?
Right here.
Page Robert for me, please.
Doing it.
Which is not to say that
you have no rights at all.
- That's not the way we do things here.
- Bob Funk to Admin.
That's not American.
I don't even think
that's legal.
- Bob Funk to Admin.
- Is that for you?
Bob Funk to Admin, please.
The chain of command
is simple.
Up here you have
the upper management.
Down here
you have the, uh,
secretaries,
janitorial and the like,
and around the center here
you have yourself
and other lesser, uh,
Middle management?
Precisely.
Middle management.
Or as we like to call it
here at Funk Foam and Futon,
upper support.
Sonny and Jean say he's here,
but he didn't answer the page.
I'd go, but I've got an online
doctor's appointment in five minutes.
- Oh, go.
- I saw him talking to the new kid.
- Uh--
- That was good.
Did you change
your clothes, Steve?
What?
Smelled like Bob.
That's--
Uh, I'm sor--
I didn't mean to snatch it away.
It's--
This is a--
This is a--
an executive clipboard.
And so there might have been
a confidential directive--
What do you do here, exactly?
Uh, V.P. of sales.
Vice president of sales?
Yeah, I made that leap.
Huh.
Anyway, the point is, uh,
maybe you'd like
to grab a bite some evening.
Tonight?
Tomorrow?
Whenever. Be happy to go over
the ins and outs of the shop.
Not a date, necessarily,
but it never hurts to have
a friend on the inside.
- Good morning, Robert.
- Good morning.
Uh, have you
met Ms. Thorne?
Yes. I hired her.
Did you forget
our meeting?
Yeah. I'll be there
in two shakes.
Actually,
we need you there now.
All right, I'll be there
in one shake.
I want you to stop
harassing this woman...
and get into my office, please.
Excuse me? I--
Was I harassing you?
I was standing right here.
Well, this is
an A and B conversation,
and you're the letter C!
Oh, no.
- That actually hurts.
- Come on.
Are you
out of your mind?
I was just...
welcoming that girl.
You were harassing that girl,
and you were supposed to be
here with me 45 minutes ago.
- You act like you're gonna spank me.
- I should. Look at you.
You look like something
the cat wouldn't even touch.
You wore that yesterday,
didn't you?
Did you even
go home last night?
And that relates
to work how?
You are on very thin ice,
and you're slipping.
Your people skills
are abominable.
Your sales suck, and if you
want to continue to work here,
you're gonna have to
change your ways.
Now.
Ronald, Ms. Thorne,
if you would.
All right. Apologize.
To whom?
Do I need to be here
for this?
Yes. To Ms. Thorne.
For harassing her.
- But I didn't harass her!
- Oh, really, that's not necessary.
- I'm not comfortable with apologies.
- Thank you.
Apologize.
- Some big brouhaha, huh?
- How's your mother, Steve?
Huh? Oh, I got
that ointment you suggested,
and the fatty tumors,
they cleared right up.
What's really going on?
Steve! Please!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go over here.
Bob, come on!
Come on what?
Say the words, Robert.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I said I don't know what to you,
and I shouldn't have said it.
If I could take it back,
I would.
If you would like to flay
the flesh from my back,
then please feel free
to do so!
'Cause I'm so sorry
I thought about fucking you!
I'm so unbelievably sorry!
Oh, my God.
Happy?
Robert, you're fired.
People? Fuck people.
People are shit.
You wanna know what it is?
I'll tell you what it is.
Futons. Okay?
That's what we do.
People are kinda integral to
the whole mercantile thing, Bob.
People, after all,
are the people who buy futons.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, people.
Blah, blah, blah, people.
Fine, Ron, but Bob's
not a people person.
Tell the world.
Bob's not a people person!
What's happening with you?
You're acting like a loser lately.
You know?
A real loser, Bob.
Like someone
who has actually lost.
How flattering.
I don't mean
that you are a loser,
you're just acting
like a loser.
Forget I said it.
I can't forget it, Ron.
It's out there.
Where? Out where?
What?
I'm sorry, I was, uh--
Your table's kind of large. I was
wondering if you could share your seat.
- Sure.
- Oh, Ron, did you hear?
Mr. Gotrocks here
wants to join us.
Oh, oh, please,
would you?
My life is in tatters,
and I can think
of nothing I'd like more
than to share
this moment with you!
Wha-- Hey! Hey!
Don't make me beg!
- Cut it out!
- You know what my first impulse was?
To tell her to go fuck herself because
I can get a better job anywhere in town.
Because I'm a contributor. Remember
last fall? I was selling 2,000 a day.
Remember? A day!
Uh-huh.
Can you talk to her?
You know how tough she can be
once she makes up her mind.
Just fuck "tough"
for me, Ron?
She likes you better.
Okay? There, I said it.
My mortification
is complete.
Mom has always liked you better,
and she'll do it if you ask her.
She doesn't like me better.
Please.
It's all so romantic,
isn't it? This misery.
Welcome to my decline.
Thank you for having me.
- Hey.
- Hey!
You, uh, ever chew a piece of
gum so long you hate yourself?
Okay.
Huh?
I'm just fucking with you.
Oh.
Very good. Yeah.
Smiley. Another box of chablis
for the young lady.
Unbelievable.
Sh--
May we come in?
Hmm...
How long
have you lived here?
Almost two years.
When you gonna
move in?
Ha-ha.
Ron was quite eloquent
on your behalf,
so I've reconsidered.
So, you will step down
as V.P. of sales
for a period
of no less than 90 days.
You will track sales
for the stores here in town
and the Pacoima outfit.
Ms. Thorne will supervise
this probationary period.
Fantastic. Track sales,
report to Minnie Mouse.
Glad to do it.
Bob...
Sorry. Sorry.
As you wish.
There is one more thing. This is
as your mother now, not your boss.
You need to get some help.
I want you to see a therapist.
Someone who--
Hi.
Hi.
I was thinking I'd go.
Oh!
Here you go.
Thanks.
See ya.
Bye.
Are you kidding?
She's a child.
What?
She's twenty...two.
Old enough to drink.
She can take care of herself.
Okay. I'm back
to being the boss.
Therapy is not requested.
It's required.
You can see anyone you like,
provided she's a woman.
You have got to let go of
Theresa and get on with your life.
What? Hold on? What?
You want me to be more up-and-up?
Uh, fine. Watch my mouth,
punch the clock, whatever.
Sky's the limit.
But a shrink?
People will talk.
Take it or leave it.
Can I keep
my office at least?
Machines, clothing, family,
flavor, pleasure--
it all wears out, Smiley.
It's entropy.
The logic of decay.
There's no man for whom pleasure
has ever been continuous.
Not even as a child?
I had no childhood, Bob.
And hello to you.
I don't know you.
Chardonnay.
This has been
a good, good day.
What? What is that?
That smell?
- Potpourri?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Gotta say,
not fooled.
Lemony zest,
misty vanilla morning, whatever.
Makes me think
of public toilets.
I see.
Which is not to say that
it smells like ass in here.
It does not.
It smells like potpourri.
And that makes me think
that you're hiding something.
Because you know what it is?
I'll tell you.
Psychiatry
is like alchemy.
Trying to define human behavior is
like trying to turn lead into gold,
which we now know
cannot be done.
I'm only here as part
of a deal I made,
which we're not discussing
because that's personal.
I don't need
some woman to-- Oop.
Pardon my French.
I mean, I don't need
some person-- hmm?--
to tell me that just because my mother
didn't teach me to wipe myself correctly,
I'm suddenly dysfunctional.
And I have quirks.
That makes me human.
But if being human
makes you crazy,
then get out your straitjacket
and lock me away.
Do you everyone who sees
a therapist is crazy?
No. I never said that.
It's-- Hey.
Therapy?
Just not something
I need.
I think everyone,
no matter how well-adjusted,
can benefit
from a little therapy.
Yes, well, of course you'd think that.
You're a therapist.
That's like a baker saying
everyone needs to eat cake,
which is not true,
because some people are fat.
The Japanese have slept on
these for over 10,000 years.
Not this exact futon,
mind you.
Oh, no!
Not this one.
Although we do
have one in the back
that the Japanese
have slept on for a--
almost, uh--
how long, Sonny?
That one's relatively new.
I think that one's only been slept on for
maybe fourteen-- fifteen hundred years.
- Wow!
- Yeah.
- Now, the Osaka mat.
- Oh, the Osaka.
Hey, were you here
when we had the Osaka?
Is that the one Ms. Funk
gave to the Smithsonian?
Exactly.
- And then it goes back to Peking.
- Peking?
Because of the post-Maoist
Cultural Heritage Laws...
regarding
Japanese antiquities.
- Oh...
- Yeah.
The point is,
I think we have something
that will easily last
until you get married again.
You have a problem
with Rorschach?
Not per se, but I was hoping for
something a little more up-to-date
in the way
of psychoanalytic tools.
But what do I know?
Give me your best spot.
Get it?
Like ink spot?
It's a joke?
Yes, I got it.
And no, I don't think
everything has to be a joke.
Okay. Hit me.
That?
It's a small penis.
Large cave
of some sort.
It's a... small penis.
Hmm.
Small penis.
Small penis.
Oh. That's a squirrel...
running up the side
of a very small penis.
Hey, I was kidding.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I was kidding about
the penises, Dr. Day.
You know that, right?
What are you writing?
Are you writing that he was
kidding about the penises?
Rorschach isn't a method, Ron.
It's a parlor trick.
It's like I went in for a shot of penicillin,
and she threw a bunch of leeches on my back.
And she's too good-looking
to be a shrink.
- So don't go back.
- Don't go back.
I have to go back, Ron.
She took copious notes.
Who knows what she'd do
if she felt I betrayed her.
And she came highly recommended.
Hey, Bobby. What do you
think about Ms. Thorne?
- She's nice, huh?
- Oh, yeah, she's a real peach.
And she smells great.
I don't know if it's one of those oils,
or it's perfume or what,
but I touched her earlier,
her shoulder.
I can still smell her.
It's--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pull up there, big shooter.
You have a wife,
and a good one.
As if it's as simple as that.
No? Then explain it to me.
She does not touch me.
We sleep in the same bed
every night,
and it's like it's
been months since--
And I keep hoping,
you know, she'll--
Forget it.
Why didn't you tell me?
You think I was gonna make fun of you?
Just don't bust my chops
for the occasional fantasy.
- I'm a big boy, okay?
- You wouldn't have an affair.
My life is hard enough
as it is.
- What?
- I need a constant to anchor myself,
- and you and Janet are my--
- That's not my job!
You gotta be your own
anchor or whatever.
You know, I can
barely anchor myself,
much less
the two of us, so...
I'm sorry.
Hey!
I got the part!
I got it!
The play. They just
called me here at work!
I got the part!
Hey! Ruth! I got the part!
Hey, Ruthie!
Raymundo,
I got the part!
I mean, therapy is for people
who don't have friends.
Where the hell is everyone?
Oh, look. I get to throw myself
under a bus again.
Bob...
Miss?
May I buy you a drink?
I'd sooner drink
a quart of my own blood.
Now that I would pay to see.
Ha! Missed me!
Mr. Funk?
Mr. Funk?
Mr. Funk?
Sorry.
Uh... Hey. Sorry.
Surprised me. What's up?
Uh, okay, um,
these form 69-J's are
filled out incorrectly again.
Oh, Christ. Those are
the bane of my existence.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Listen, uh, you won't mention
this to my mother, will you?
No.
Uh, but if they're filed wrong again,
we will get fined by the city.
- Duly noted.
- Okay. Bye.
- Hi, Ms. Thorne.
- Hi, Mr. Funk.
Oh, my God. Bob, you gotta
remember to change your clothes.
Gross.
Very funny.
Oh, there you are.
I'm off to Bangkok.
Bangkok?
Is that a joke?
Didn't you get the memo?
I'm on vacation next week.
Thailand. Asia.
Safe trip,
Ms. F.
Thank you, Steve.
- Ride's ready.
- Don't hover, dear.
Did I tell you I got
the part in the play?
Hey, will you freshen up?
This is my office.
- Have a great trip, Ms. Funk.
- Thank you, Jean.
- Safe travels.
- Thanks, Sonny.
Her highness
has left the building.
I hear she's off to her
castle on Mean Mountain
to feast off the flesh
of innocents.
Hey, I'm not sure you pressed
this area out right here.
I thought she was
going to Thailand.
Oh, 69-J's, huh?
- Yeah.
- Did Ms. Thorne sign off on those?
Give me a little credit,
huh? Okay?
How's the, uh, the thing?
The Janet thing.
What?
I'm trying to help.
I know, but you
know what? Don't.
Don't help. Physician,
heal thyself, you know?
Meaning what?
Meaning you can smell the liquor
from three cubicles down, Bobby.
I haven't had one drop yet today.
Not one drop!
It doesn't matter.
It's coming off of you like...
like Grandma Dorothy
with her Manhattans at the club.
You remember that?
I can't win.
Come on.
- Where you going?
- Post office.
Is that okay?
Keeping tabs on me now?
You're keeping tabs
on me for Mom.
Bobby, come on!
You know what I need from you
from this point on? Nothing!
I can do this,
all of this, myself.
I went to college with
Dave Bernstein at Dreamy's.
One call! People all over town
are saying nice things about me.
All the time I'm getting
calls from people,
"Love to work with you, if you
can cut yourself free of the tit!"
Hey, hey, come on!
It's biblical, this story.
The mother both brothers need,
brother against brother.
This is good material.
Hey, Steve! You should be
writing this shit down, my man!
Hey, Bob,
welcome back.
We hung out
with your new boss.
We may like her even better
than we like you, Bob.
You like everybody
better than me.
Well!
It's true.
But so impolite
to bring it up.
Oh, uh, no.
No, you.
Go. Please go.
- I'll make some more.
- Oh, no, it's fine.
- But I can make fresh.
- This is still good, right?
What happened?
I don't know. Maybe the acid in the coffee
did something to the thing in the thing.
Excuse me. Are you actually
reading Moby Dick?
Yeah, I'm getting
an accounting certification.
Why do I always
do stuff like this?
I think Bob and Ms. Thorne
make a cute couple, don't you?
What? You think
she'd go for him?
I don't know.
She's that type.
What type?
The type that goes for,
uh, potential.
Hey, look. There's a lot of
people with potential in the world.
I don't think Bob
is one of them. Okay?
- Okay. Sure.
- Okay.
American lit?
It's not required.
I just wanted something with a
little human spirit in it, you know?
- And I like whales.
- Don't read the end.
Now I feel bad because your
mom's paying for half my tuition,
so I kind of feel like
I'm defrauding her, you know?
And then I trash
the coffee maker.
Jesus.
Well, don't worry
about it.
We got, like, ten
of those things on sale.
And as far as
the class goes, well...
it'll be our secret.
Thank you.
Smart.
It's okay.
Yeah, I think
you killed it.
- Guess I'll have tea.
- Yeah.
I'll make it.
By the way, your
sweater's on inside out.
- Don't work too late. Good night.
- I won't. Good night.
Ah, Christ!
- Oh!
- Jesus!
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.
Sorry.
My heart actually stopped
there for a second.
I am so sorry. Yeah.
Hey, did you get a chance
to finish up those form 69-J's?
- Mailed them out today.
- Oh.
Uh, did you keep a file copy?
Because I never saw them, you know.
On my desk.
Okay.
You pulling
some O.T.?
Um... Well, I was
drinking some tea,
but I managed to spill an
entire cupful into my keyboard.
Do you think I ruined it,
the keyboard?
It was just
herbal tea, but--
Herbal tea.
Like it makes a difference.
Yeah. I'm sure
it'll be fine.
This elevator
doesn't seem to be working.
I can just walk up.
I'm just going up to the roof.
- Uh, why?
- To throw myself off, actually.
- What?
- I'm just kidding.
I like to go up sometimes
just to look at the stars.
Oh. Okay.
Would you like
to come with?
Uh... really?
Why not?
My folks were big campers.
I would just lay out
and watch the stars all night.
In August,
there's meteor showers.
One night I saw
33 shooting stars.
Really?
You know, I don't think
I've ever seen one.
It's comforting, isn't it?
How inconceivably huge
the universe is.
Comforting?
It's terrifying.
Yeah.
But... just against
something so infinite,
nothing with our lives
can seem so...
consequential.
Huh.
Your brother told me you and he
used to go camping with your mom.
Yeah. Well...
My father died
when we were little,
so she was always trying to
be the dad, too, you know?
We'd usually
end up in a hotel.
You two are, uh, friendly,
you and my brother?
He's a sweet guy.
He's sweet? Hmm?
He's sweet?
- Did I say something wrong?
- He's married.
And he's thinking
about you a lot!
Okay. Whoa.
Ronnie and Janet--
Who's Ronnie?
My brother.
And Janet, his wife, they've
been together forever,
and she's like a sister.
And he's thinking
about you--
Aren't you married?
Uh, well, I was.
And you never once
thought about another woman?
That's different.
She's good to him.
Your wife wasn't
good to you?
She... She took up
with another guy.
She left me
to be with him.
I'm sorry.
I know what that's like.
- You do?
- I do.
But I don't think
about your brother that way.
And to be fair to him,
thinking isn't a crime.
Thank God.
I'd be on death row,
you know what I mean?
That was a joke.
Oh, I know.
I just didn't laugh.
Thinking may not be a crime, but...
wishes can be dangerous things.
What do you wish for
that's so dangerous?
That I didn't
talk so much. You?
Oh, that I didn't
break everything.
Remind me never
to give you my heart.
I'm sorry. That was wrong.
I shouldn't have said that.
No. No, no, no, no.
That was
inappropriate.
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.
- But, uh-- You?
- No, I'm gonna stay here.
Okay. Good night.
Yeah. Ms. Thorne?
Yeah?
Do you think we
could ever be friends?
Oh, well...
stranger things
have happened.
Ow!
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
Then when I was 14,
I dated a girl named Lisa.
She was full
through the hips.
Cute overbite.
I broke up with her.
I don't remember why.
Later, she was absent
from school a great deal.
I believe the two
are unrelated.
Then I lost the weight and
started dating the "pretty" girls.
Jeez, I almost said
the "normal" girls.
I'm a sick man.
Yes, you are.
Just trying to find that thread
that ties it all together.
One minute I'm losing
my mind, the next,
God is looking
right at me, but...
just a glance.
That's the nature
of God, Bob.
Chardonnay.
Feel a powerful mojo
comin' on.
Suppose it'd kill you
to be a little sweeter?
Go fuck your mother.
Hear that? Some women, they pop off,
they expect us to be gents about it.
It's like they forget
we can beat them up.
Okay, come on.
Would it kill you
to just talk to me?
Enough.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Smiley.
I'm sorry.
Weird fuckin' world, huh?
Hey, sister, you wanna buy a
ticket to this weird fuckin' world?
You wanna drop dead?
Yeah.
So I'm at the hot dog cart today and
I'm thinking about my crappy sales
and how I'm not
getting any younger.
I don't want to end up
one of those sad sacks,
sitting in a diner with an early-bird
hamburger and a free senior coffee.
And here's the what. I used to think that
drinking coffee with a hamburger was bizarre.
Now I don't mind it.
Which all goes to say that
aging is mystifying and a horror.
Anyway, there I am in line,
ruminating on my mounting failures
and my imminent decline,
when the Arab guy goes,
"Who's next?"
And I go, "I am,"
you know, because I am,
when this bike messenger says,
"Gimme an orange drink."
Just blurts it out like that.
"Gimme an orange drink."
And the Arab--
Israeli, Persian, whatever--
he gets it for him.
Then he takes
my order.
Me, I want two hot dogs.
Onions, relish, no mustard.
I fuckin' hate mustard.
Except with ham.
And then only
if it's honey mustard,
but believe me,
Mr. Saheem Sahbip
doesn't have any honey mustard,
you know what I mean?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I boring you?
- Bob--
- No, no, no. Please, please.
Feel free to stretch
right out and go to sleep,
and old boring Uncle Bob will tell you
a nice "sweepy wittle" bedtime story
from his ho-hum life.
Bob, it's not that.
Staring at me with those
big, sleepy green eyes,
begging me, "Oh, God,
Bob, be interesting.
Please, God. Bob, tell me
something good for once."
It's nothing personal,
I promise.
No, no. That was
a suppressed yawn of boredom.
I saw it
with my own two eyes.
I pay you, okay?
You work for me, Dr. Freud.
Bottom line!
Feel better?
A little.
Anyway, after
the hot dog incident--
let's refer to it from now on
as the "hot dog incident,"
because I don't wanna
plumb the depths of the--
Anyway, I see
this guy today. Old guy.
Yes?
He's dancing out in the
middle of Parthenia Avenue
with a big piece of cardboard on his
chest that says, "Jesus, I love you."
And I'm like,
"Hello! Hello in there!
He apparently doesn't
love you, you yammerin' fuck!"
I mean, why would I be wandering
the streets like some kind of dunce
if Jesus loved him?
You know?
Why did you feel
like it was you?
What? Why did I
think who was me?
Well, you said, "Why would I
be wandering the streets
like You know, of dunce
if Jeperhaps you heard that.
Perhaps you nodded off there
briefly and dreamt it,
but I did not say that I--
Let's talk instead for
a minute about listening.
Okay?
Let's talk about respect.
I'm sorry, Bob, it--
it is time.
I know. I know.
The big hand's on the 12,
the little hand's on the 6.
Proud of me? I can tell time.
Bob's a time teller, everybody!
Can I come twice next week?
Bangkok is choked
with pollution,
and the people
eat rats and bugs.
Jean said you went
to some mountain.
Was it
Shut Up Mountain?
Shouldn't you be
selling something?
How was your trip,
Mrs. Funk?
You're back already?
Jeez.
Welcome back, Ms. F.
What'd you bring me?
I'll get that--
I'll get that for you.
- You met a guy?
- In Thailand?
Yes. Thanks.
I'm not dead yet.
Oh, just, uh,
welcome home, Ms. F.
Thank you, Steve.
How's your mother?
Oh, great, great.
She can feel her feet again.
So she's up and about.
Lovely.
Steve, did you tell the boys
about the $12,000 fine
the city has levied
against us?
I-- I was--
No, no.
I'll tell them.
12,000?
That's steep.
There were eight
misfiled forms,
which, according to the city,
can be construed as fraud.
You just have no chemistry
for business, Robert.
I wish I knew what chemical
it is that I'm missing.
Just trying to do a job here.
Perhaps seeing it
as just a job
is the problem,
Robert.
Duly noted. Get more
personally involved.
You're missing the point.
Business is business.
It is not personal.
And... you were on probation.
Are you
firing me again?
Because I've done
everything you asked.
- The shrink?
- She's not.
- You're not firing him.
- My mind is made up.
I don't
want you to fire Bob, Mom.
Things aren't going too
well for Janet and I, and--
Jesus, don't, Ron.
I couldn't take it.
Mom, please.
Make my life that much easier.
Plan and sweat
and toil of the earth,
but verily,
the greatest of thine plans
shall cometh to naught.
Life...
is not a meritocracy, Bob.
It's survival
of the fittest.
The rest... end up here.
You shouldn't be
so afraid.
What am I afraid of?
The attraction
you're feeling right now.
It's not your fault.
I got an extra gene.
Make me genetically
irresistible.
You're an asshole.
Yeah.
But I'm
a charismatic asshole.
Let me buy you a drink.
Why would I
let you do that?
We've been enemies
long enough.
Here, here...
What the hell?
# Chills and fever #
# Chills and fever #
# That's what I get
when I think of you #
- Off! Off!
- # Chills and fever #
- # Chills and fever #
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Let me help you. Hurry.
- # Well, I love you, baby #
# And there's nothing
that I can do #
No. No, no, no.
That's not it. That's not it.
# Oh, Lord, I tremble #
- Ow!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- # When you touch me #
- No, don't touch it. Don't touch it. Oh!
# I feel like I'm catching #
# A-catching on fire #
# Help, I need you #
# I can hardly speak #
# And now you know
the reason why #
# Chills and fever #
 # Chills and fever #
You seen my other shoe?
It's a black pump.
Huh. Black, red, magenta.
If it's a pump,
it probably belongs to you.
Why don't you stay?
We can go to breakfast.
Look, um...
I don't even remember
your name. Sorry.
It's, uh, it's Bob.
Yeah, um...
I don't wanna spend
the night with you.
I don't wanna have
breakfast with you.
You had your shot.
It's on my stomach.
Well... let's try again.
What, have you
never done this before?
You wanna be my man now?
You wanna be my big daddy?
I let you fuck me,
so you win. Okay?
Can't you be happy
with that?
Bobby?
- Yeah.
- Mom has a job for you.
Fuck this!
It's all we've got open.
Seriously.
- This is an object lesson.
- Bob-- Maybe that, too.
What about him?
Um, Mom's retiring him.
He'll show you
what to do. Sanjay?
Sanjay!
Christ, I thought
he was dead.
They're finally
letting me retire.
Did you know that
when I came to work he--
Hey.
You look like
Bob Funk.
Eh?
He's disoriented.
Ah.
Get him off.
Get him off of me.
- I love this boy.
- Sanjay...
Hey! Get out of this!
Bobby!
...Blue Jays
and the Yankees meet tonight--
Bobby!
Dave Stieb gets the start for the Jays,
while the Yanks send Guidry to the mound.
...after the Blue Jays stormed back in the
top of the ninth with 12 runs to win the game.
Oh, thank God you're--
What happened to your face?
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?
You've been missing
for nearly three days.
- What? Days?
- What happened to your face?
- Bob-- Bobby!
- Call you later.
Bobby!
Bobby, if you don't talk
to me, I'll come back here.
Bobby!
This is the story
of your life.
- Come on, just chill.
- Fuck you!
Ow.
Ah-- Oh.
Oh!
Oh, my God. You scared the hell
out of me. Christ, you look crappy.
- Ron!
- Jesus, I'm right here.
Bobby!
- You came to the house.
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.
You're looking better.
Anyway, um...
I'll get coffee.
That'd be good, thanks.
Thank you.
The janitor thing.
- Is that still an option?
- Yeah. Yes, oh, yeah.
Yes!
Where was this?
I'm pretty sure the original
Michigan Avenue in New York City.
Where do the old
readers meet?
Around the corner,
third door on the left.
- Hey, Tommy.
- See you next week.
All right.
Good luck to you.
Thank you.
Well, hi. I'm Mark.
Bob.
First time with us,
I think. So how you doing?
I'm okay, I guess.
- Friend of Bill's.
- Yeah. Bill Wilson.
He's our founder.
I'm sorry.
Just, uh...
I don't have the same
problems as these people.
I have it easy.
It just makes me think
I've been acting like a pussy.
I hear what you're saying, but I think
you're being a little hard on yourself.
I'm listening to people with real
problems talk about the disease.
If what I have is a disease,
then the cure is character.
Character
is important,
but the cure
is not drinking.
There are many paths
that lead to that cure.
This one's mine.
Makes me look at
why I do what I do,
but it's not some
requirement for the cure.
- People talk like it is.
- Ah, people like to talk.
Only thing you need to listen to
is the one voice, the true voice,
the voice that lets you
know what's right.
If that voice brings you back
to us, we're not going anywhere.
Thanks.
Jenny, hey!
Haven't see you in a while.
Hey, Bob!
Welcome back.
We missed you.
Friend of Bill's?
I get it.
What the hell was that
supposed to mean?
Sanjay.
Sanjay. Sanjay.
Okay, all right.
I thought
you were dead!
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're sorry
that I'm alive?
No. I didn't mean to say it.
- Oh, that's-- It's okay.
- I'm glad you're alive.
- Okay.
- You're a good boy.
Where am I?
Oh, hi. I haven't
seen you in forever.
Hi.
You look fantastic.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, and you
look great, too.
Oh, thanks.
- I should go. I'm really late.
- Okay.
- I'm here every night.
- I'll see you again.
- Yeah.
- I'm here every night.
- Night.
- Right.
- Good night.
- Bye.
- Nighty night.
- Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
Nighty night?
Bob! Hey, the place
has never looked better.
Which is a testament
to your skill.
So what do you need,
Sonny?
Well, it's the desk.
You see how I have it
set up here?
I got the coffee mug here,
my pens here,
order forms here,
record book here.
Could you make sure
it stays that way?
- All right.
- 'Cause sometimes I come in here
and the pens are over there, and the coffee
cup is where the order forms should go.
It's complete chaos, so could
you look out for me, brotha?
You bet.
Good night.
Dude, you are so cold.
- What? What'd I do?
- "What? What'd I do?"
This is broken.
It's honest work.
And I don't mean like "Brother,
can you spare a dime" honest.
It's straightforward.
The fruits of your labors
are right there.
Floors are swept,
carpets vacuumed.
Mm-hmm.
I feel custodial,
like I've been given
the custody of something.
I'm the caretaker.
- The curate.
- Right.
Yes, I'm a janitor,
but it's not like sales.
Right here.
Dragging Mrs. Whozits
around the showroom floor,
trying to get her to buy
the most expensive futon
for Tiffany to take
to Brown in the fall.
That's not honest work.
It's getting people to think
that they need things.
It's not custodial.
I think
you're doing great, Bob.
You don't have to yank my chain
here, Ron. I'm just talking.
No, no. I--
Cleanest I've ever
seen the place. Truly.
Thanks, Ron.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You ever think about dad?
Yeah, sure. Yeah.
What do you remember?
Anything?
Yeah, I kind of remember
we were going fishing.
I remember being
excited about that.
The green tent.
Yeah.
Why do you ask?
I don't know.
What's that?
like no static or something?
Yeah, exactly.
That's cool.
You and Janet ever think
about seeing someone?
What, like a counselor?
Um...
Just think about it.
It's your life, okay?
Hey, are you using
your free days?
Like going to museums,
ball games,
all the stuff
we never get to do here?
Uh, no. Not yet.
You gotta strike a blow for all
of us chained to a desk all day.
I bet you somebody like Ms. Thorne
would like stuff like that,
like culture and...
stuff like...
I don't know.
- Culture.
- Yeah.
Like that.
Now, get back to work.
Yes, sir, Mr. Funk.
That son of a bitch.
What's up?
Bob super-glued
everything to the desk.
That's kinda funny,
though, right?
- Kinda funny?
- Yeah.
It's fucking genius.
So I finally get to window,
and I ask the lady for two-cent stamps.
You know,
for the increase.
And she shuffles through
the drawer for a minute,
and I'm thinking, "What are the chances
she'll find something useful in there
like, oh, I don't know,
stamps?"
But no! She turns and ambles on back to
the back room back there-- back there--
God knows what they do
back there.
The door swings open, and I see some
guy standing back there in a T-shirt
staring off into space with his
lips moving-- lips moving-- lips moving--
lips moving like
some idiot savant
composing a sonata for flute and
fucking harpsichord back there.
And I'm thinking, "This is part of
the federal government, isn't it?"
I mean, we got a line
snaking all through the lobby,
and they got one woman
working the window.
One! And she's gone.
She's disappeared. Poof!
All these people in line, they hate
me because I made the lady go away!
Are you all right?
I love you, Dr. Day.
Okay? I said it, and I'm glad I said it.
- Bob, I...
- I know it's not healthy.
Are you gonna tell me you
haven't heard of one instance
where a doctor and a patient
fell in love and got--
And I'm not saying we should get married.
No, I've been down that road.
Eight years with a woman
named Pestilence.
Fuck marriage.
Just throw it down and fuck it.
I wanted to tell you
how I feel
because that's what I paid
money to come here and do.
I think you're confusing the fact
that I help you to feel better
with the whole idea of a loving
and healthy and mutual relationship.
You don't have
to cheapen it.
Yes, I feel better.
But if that's a crime, then shave
my head and electrocute me.
That's not why
I love you.
Bob, I've grown
quite fond of you.
But you must know that I don't have
feelings of romantic love for you.
Give me a little credit.
I didn't think I would tell you,
and you were gonna fall
into my arms. "Oh, Bob!"
You're a sexy, classy lady,
and you act like one.
I didn't think I would tell you,
and we'd start to date
and spend long evenings
together and go to breakfast.
There's no hidden agenda
here, Dr. Day.
I'm not trying to swing
a special rate, you know?
I just wanted to see if
I could still say the words.
That's all.
Yes, I'm sorry,
we are a little past time.
Bob.
Don't underestimate your ability to
love someone who can love you back.
See you next time.
Culture!
It's a blank canvas.
How can they call it a painting
if there isn't any paint?
That's more your speed.
You want room
for milk?
Excuse me.
You want room for milk?
Yes, I would love room for milk.
Thank you for asking.
Seriously, guy,
what's going on?
It's...
just so beautiful.
Hi.
- Hi!
- Oh! Jesus Christ!
Sorry! Sorry.
- You've got to stop doing that.
- I'm sorry.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna get you
a collar with a bell.
A really big bell.
Um, what have you got there?
I don't, uh--
Huh? Nothing.
Behind your--
It was supposed to be
a surprise for the morning.
Surprise me now.
Uh...
Okay. Close 'em
and put 'em out.
Out. Put 'em out.
There we go.
And... ta-da!
It's The Starry Night.
The artist
cut his own ear off.
- But you probably knew that.
- I did.
Oh, wow.
I don't think even I could
spill stuff out of this.
Yeah, that last spill took a full
bottle of that Didi stuff to get out.
What was that? Ink?
Motor oil.
- Sorry.
- Of course.
Oh, what happened
to your phone?
It broke.
Never seen a receiver
broken in half like this.
Did you strike something
with it?
- I dropped it.
- From where?
I did a pretty good job taping it,
though, don't you think?
Very nice, yes.
The edge of the tape kept coming
up and getting stuck in my hair,
so thank you.
No problem.
You're welcome.
So what brings you here
so late?
I was just
in the neighborhood.
Huh.
Look, uh,
this is an apology.
We got off on the wrong foot with
the harassment thing and the 69-J's,
and I was a jerk.
Yeah.
No.
Apology accepted.
I mean, clearly
you've changed, but...
but the good kinda change.
Has anybody, you know,
told you?
My shrink, maybe, but...
you'd be the first
real person.
Thank you, Ms. Thorne.
You're welcome.
Oh, uh,
I got you a flower.
I love daisies.
Thank you.
Oh, and... a muffin.
What kind?
Cranberry.
Shut up!
- Cranberry is my favorite.
- Really?
Yeah! Somebody told you.
No, no.
I went to the Muffin Hut.
They got like 102 different--
Kinda like, "Cranberry!"
Is it your favorite,
really?
It is.
It really, really is.
So, uh, you want
another club soda?
Yeah, with lots and lots
and lots of lime.
Fighting
the good fight, huh?
What is that? I don't know what
that means, "the good fight."
Drying out.
On the wagon.
Is that clock right?
Yep.
It never seems
late enough to go home.
And what's late enough?
Time is, what, like a line?
But there's no room in that.
If time is a construct,
then why can't we reconstruct
it from a line to a box?
Like a coffin?
Hi.
Everything's a riddle to me
these days.
It's paranormal.
I wish I was some kind
of oracle, you know?
I wish I was the kind of guy
who could figure things out.
Why are you here, Bob?
To lord your new sobriety
around the room?
Or are you just waiting to fall off
the wagon onto more familiar ground?
- I'm here to see my friends.
- Yeah?
What's this?
A G&T from Brewer.
Your friend.
Welcome back.
I'll tell you
why you're here, Bob.
And if you're wise,
you'll listen.
Why am I here?
You're here
to say goodbye.
Goodbye.
She had very large
gums and very small teeth.
When she smiled,
it was disconcerting,
like the mouth
of a small child.
It was repulsive to me.
Still, I was married to her
for eight years.
I learned to live with it.
I adapted
to the status quo.
Now I can't adapt
because there's no constant.
You'd think it'd be easy,
like riding a bike.
For me, these days,
it's easy like falling down.
Let me know if you guys
need anything.
- Laura.
- Huh?
Uh, this is my mom.
Oh, wow. Hi.
I've heard...
so much about you.
Thank you, dear.
Excellent coffee.
Thank you.
Okay. Give a shout
if you need me.
Thanks.
She's a very
attractive girl.
I like it here.
I just need...
Yeah. Just a little
hair of the dog, Robert.
I've had a long night.
- I know the feeling.
- Hmm.
Maybe it isn't so difficult
to get a good cup of coffee.
Finding a good man,
though...
Oh, I met an old friend
of yours. I...
Ah. Derrick Milton.
- Remember him?
- Sure. From college?
What was he majoring in,
do you remember?
- Was it date rape?
- Mom!
Don't be a prude,
Robert.
What was he like?
Derrick Milton?
Mom.
We lived...
You father and I lived...
with your grandma and grandpa
when we were
first married.
All the little kids on the whole
block used to come to the house
to see if Bob could
come out and play.
Really?
One night I woke up, and he was
having some sort of seizure.
Stiff as a board
and soaked in sweat.
Uh, next day
at the doctor's,
he had another attack
right there in the office.
They operated and found fluid
on his brain from his sinuses.
He had a final seizure
in the recovery room.
I was holding his hand
at the time.
An orderly came,
and he...
he had to pry
Bobby's fingers open...
to free me.
He never woke up.
That was two days before
your fifth Christmas.
They asked me
to donate his eyes.
At first I said no.
He had such wonderful eyes,
I couldn't bear it.
But then I approved,
and they went
to a man from...
Antelope Valley.
Bob's brown eyes.
That's the first time you
told me what really happened.
I know.
Why didn't you ever tell me?
You look so much like him.
Sometimes I see you,
and I think you are him.
You're older now
than he was then.
You should've told me.
I'm sorry.
But my whole life,
everything I've built
has been from working so hard
not to think about it.
I'm sorry.
I can't stop this.
I don't think
you're supposed to.
You're not
supposed to.
Mama mia.
- Oh, thanks.
- Hey, Steve. Hey, wait.
- What?
- How's the play?
Oh, well, it's scary,
you know.
Opening night's only a few
weeks away. I got a lot of lines.
But my mother's helping me.
She's holding book.
That's what we call it when someone
helps you with your lines, "holding book."
- Got all the lingo down, huh?
- A little bit.
Then tell me, why do
they say, "Break a leg"?
Hi.
You're here late.
It's more of these 69-J's.
It's a historical collection.
- Yikes.
- Tedious, right?
Your mom needs them
by tomorrow morning.
Some guy from the
city's coming to get 'em.
Okay.
She said to leave them on her desk and
then back them up onto her computer,
but it's locked.
I'll give them to her.
Could I back them up
onto Raymundo's computer?
Sure.
That's okay.
I got it.
Thank you.
Hey, are you hungry?
'Cause there's this excellent Indian place
in the strip mall next to the sushi place.
We could order in.
I got this bottle of wine,
and it's breathing.
That's so sweet of you,
but I already ate, Mr. Funk.
Please. Call me Ron.
Okay.
Ron.
Ron.
Tell me, what kind of perfume--
Is it perfume?
It's white ginger oil,
actually.
It's very
distinctive.
Thank you.
I can tell you where
to get some for your wife.
- You get back to me with that.
- Okay. See you later.
- Good night, Steve.
- Yeah.
Do you ever think about
what you might be missing in life?
- Well...
- Like life is flying by,
and you're just watching,
wishing you can be a part of it,
and feeling...
incapable of joining in?
I guess I never really
thought about it like that.
I found this hair
growing out of my ear,
and now it's like,
"Am I getting old all of a sudden?"
There's nothing old
about ear hair.
My wife, she teases me
about it sometimes, you know?
I'm sure she hasn't forgotten
what a great guy she has.
Oh.
Oh.
- You're all I think about.
- Okay, Mr. Funk--
Do you think we have
chemistry, you and me?
As friends,
yes, definitely,
but I don't think that there's
a romantic thing going on here.
Because I think I feel enough
for the both of us.
Oh, great. It's not you, okay?
It's not you, you're great.
Is it Bob? I don't understand it.
He's got nothing going.
- Hi, Mr. Funk.
- Hey, what's-- Bob!
I, uh...
I got this memo from Mom.
She said she wants
to see me in the morning.
Probably about my old job.
- That's really super.
- That's great.
I should go.
Yeah. Good night.
- I'm sorry if I kept you.
- That's okay.
So, how are things down at
the lab, Professor Chemistry?
"Dear Ron, what the fuck?"
You're like groping all over
an employee like a monkey!
Oh, and "P.S.,
you're a married monkey."
End of letter.
I was just
thinking out loud.
What does that even mean?
It was just a hope
or a dream or--
I didn't think you'd be
playing Secret Agent Man.
Oh, no.
- What?
- Oh, no.
Oh, no.
What?
I just shredded
all the 69-J's.
Yeah, well, good riddance.
I hate those fucking things.
You idiot!
Don't you see
how huge this is?
Ms. Thorne compiled these for Mom for
tomorrow, and I just shredded them.
Don't you see?
Damn it!
Damn it!
How can you
just stand there, huh?
If you know how huge this is,
why are you just standing there?
Because I'm the idiot
who didn't shred the forms.
Mom is gonna completely
kill me, okay?
Don't be so afraid
of her, Ron.
I'm past 30, Bob.
It's too late for me
to stop being afraid of Mom.
I'm gonna die afraid of Mom.
Aren't you afraid of Mom?
I guess I'm not.
Well, that's just stupid.
Breathe.
Breathe.
Go home.
Bob...
Go home to your wife.
I'll tell you what it is.
I'm a carpenter, and I wanna
build something out of wood.
Which makes sense,
my being a carpenter and all.
Anyway, I'm making
this thing out of wood.
I have some pretty good
wood to work with,
and I know how I want the
thing to look when it's done.
I have basic tools:
the hammer, the nails,
the yadda yadda yadda
and the blah blah blah.
And I want to miter the
corners of my new wooden thing,
but I don't have
a "miter-er".
That was a lousy analogy.
You're on
the brink of something.
Yeah, exactly.
Something. I just--
But I don't know what.
I feel...
good?
Did you ever
ask that woman out?
Yeah, well, I didn't say
I wasn't still a coward.
It's not cowardice.
In fact,
it's kind of endearing.
Don't say that.
I might think you're
starting to like me.
Uh, you know what?
I'm sorry, but I'm actually gonna
have to cut out of here a little early.
I'm meeting my sponsor
for a drink.
Right. Okay, well...
Will you marry me?
I mean I'll see you next week.
That's all it took?
See you next time.
I've said
much funnier things.
Much funnier things.
As far as I'm concerned,
it never happened, okay?
Tell him
not to worry about it.
It's embarrassing
because the truth is...
I'm the one who knocked
everything off balance here.
The truth is the only thing that
you never have to be ashamed of.
Ugly or not.
Everything that
I stain, break or ruin,
that's embarrassing to me.
But that's who I am.
It's part of your charm.
Thank you.
But what I'm
trying to say is
don't be afraid
to be yourself.
It's all you've got.
I sound like one of those crappy
self-help books I read in my twenties.
What? Are you past 30?
Not as far as you know.
So why don't you just
tell him to leave?
So maybe you should tell him again.
Hold one one second.
Bob, I don't think he
wants anyone disturbing him.
It's okay. I'm his brother.
Hey, open up, nimrod!
- Yes, Ron?
- Hey, tell nimrod to open the door.
Yes, Ron.
Um, he said, um...
go away.
- You're quoting him?
- Verbatim.
That means "word for word."
Fancy. Okay, I'll leave,
but not till after I tell you
about the time that Ron and I
went to our friend Andy's house
and we were looking
at Playboys,
and Ron got
so worked up that--
What?
It's a charming story.
I don't think my secretary needs
to know about me wetting my pants.
- You were nine years old.
- I told Janet, okay?
I told her the whole thing, okay?
You happy?
- About the Playboys?
- About Ms. Thorne.
And you're mad at me?
I'm sorry I caught you.
Should I say that?
No. But we're gonna start
looking for somebody to...
you know, see.
- Like a marriage counselor?
- Bob, could you keep it down?
Jesus, God, Christ!
Yes!
Now I gotta go tell Mom
that I screwed the pooch.
- You did what?
- Quit kidding around.
It isn't just a job to me.
I happen to like it here. I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
I was the closest thing you had
to a male role model.
You think
I'm ashamed of you?
I've never felt
that way, not once.
I didn't mean
what I said last night.
I was out of my mind.
What do you think
Mom's gonna do?
She's probably gonna transfer
me to one of the outer stores.
Worse case, the warehouse
in Panorama City.
Ouch.
Hey, you wouldn't have told that story
really about being at Andy's, would you?
- Yes.
- No way.
Life is hard, my friend.
Good morning.
I'll be with you in just a minute.
I don't have
a lot of time, boys.
So, Robert, I would like to re-offer you
the position of vice president of sales.
And I'm happy
to have you back.
Me, too.
That's freaking awesome!
Ms. Thorne tells me that
she left the 69-J's with you.
Yeah, well,
about that...
- I shredded them.
- I shredded them.
What?
I was helping Ronnie out
at the shredder last night,
and I...
- You shredded them?
- Yeah.
- Bob...
- But the disk--
Uh, yeah,
shredded that, too.
But she backed it up
on Raymundo's computer.
I had to replace
the computer
because I guess
I spilled some wine on it.
- You're drinking again?
- No!
No! The wine was mine!
Don't listen to him, Mom. I did it.
Thanks, Ronnie,
but no thanks.
Did you or did you not destroy
all traces of the form 69-J's?
I completely--
I vigorously did.
Mom, It's not true.
I will give you such a smack,
I swear to God.
Ronnie, how long at the outside
to compile a new historical set?
If Ms. Thorne has the worksheets,
four days, three if I hustle.
Hustle.
- I'll clean out my locker.
- Mom, don't.
- Calm down.
- No! I don't want to calm down!
Enough.
My offer still stands.
You're not firing me?
I'm not firing you.
You're not firing him?
My God! I'm an island
in Crazy River!
No, I'm not firing him.
You mean, I actually worked
for something, and I got it.
Weird.
I quit.
Say again?
I quit.
Is this a joke, Robert?
It's "Bob," okay?
I'm my father's son.
But, uh... Sunday, Mom,
for dinner, right?
Ron, you tell Janet
I'll actually show up.
I quit! I quit!
Hi, Bob--
Ooh.
Bob, Bob,
she's at class.
Oh. Hey, Steve, I quit!
Okay. You still gonna
come see my play?
- Wouldn't miss it!
- Yes!
I'm afraid there will be a
slight delay with the Form 69-J's.
Hello, Violet.
Been a long time.
Gerald Mann.
How are you?
Now, remember, this is a
cotton mattress, not a futon.
How's that feel, huh?
I quit!
- Oh, good luck, Bob!
- Go get 'em, killer!
I quit!
I like him better as a rummy.
I quit!
Oh, Mr. Funk, hi.
Unbelievable. I was just
thinking about you.
Please sit.
Uh, thanks.
Huh. Oh, uh...
It's Bob, by the way.
Oh, I know.
My name's Sylvia.
Oh, I know.
It's a lovely name.
Thank you.
My mom wanted
to call me "Rose,"
but my Dad didn't want me
to be called "Rose Thorne,"
so they named me Sylvia,
which means "woods."
Oh.
The usual for Bob.
Anything else for you?
No, I'm fine,
thank you.
Anything at all?
No, I'm good.
She's nice.
Mm.
Thank you.
I come here all the time.
I know.
Your mom told me.
You just quit all of a sudden,
and I didn't know if I would have
a chance to say goodbye or whatever.
I was gonna call you, but I didn't
want you to think I was a stalker.
- I wouldn't have thought that.
- You wouldn't?
- Maybe I should call you sometime.
- Maybe you should.
Maybe I'll do that.
Or maybe you could just...
take what it is that you were
gonna say to me on the phone
and tell it to me
in person, maybe.
Like if I were to ask you if you
wanted to come see Steve's play with me.
Yeah, uh, or whatever.
Sylvia, would you like
to come see Steve's play--
Yes, I would.
This is one of those
dangerous wishes.
- It is not.
- It is.
And do you wanna hear
something weird?
I had a dream about you
last night.
Really?
Well, tell me.
Unless it's gross
or something.
Oh, no, not at all.
Well, we lived
in a campground,
which, you know,
I don't know what that means.
I was walking you back
to your campsite one evening,
and I wanted to hold your hand,
I wanted to hold it so badly,
and you knew that I wanted
to hold your hand.
And you said,
"Why don't you hold my hand?"
And I said--
and I swear I said this
in a dream--
I said that I was afraid
that touching you
would start my fall
into oblivion.
And then you reached out,
you took my hand and you said,
"Let's go."
I talk too much.
No, you don't.
Yeah. I'm pushing.
I'm a pusher.
I should be hanging around schoolyards,
trying to get the kids hooked on the horse.
No.
That's not it.
I would like for you
to hold my hand...
but they're glued
to my purse.
# One look #
# One stare #
# You had me #
# Oh #
# You had me #
# Oh #
# Don't change #
# The way you look at me #
# Don't change #
# The way you smile #
# Don't change the way
you speak to me #
# Don't change 
what I feel inside #
And yet would my life
be a tale...
worth the telling?
Yes.
A privy, yes.
No!
You are, as you know,
my brother.
And yon woman known
to us both, our mother,
bid you
come hither!
Sing, madrigal!
Sing!
Oh, madrigal!
There is no joy
in this.
We are all
but shadows.
To the feast!
Take him!
Take him now!
Finish it!
Oh!
This is the moment
of my death.
Bravo! Bravo!
Steve!
Ah, yeah. Thanks.
Very beautiful!
Very sweet!
Have you met
my mom?
That's okay. Mom, I wanna
show you to somebody else.
This is Ruthie
over here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You did great. Oh!
Over here is
the hand, Steve.
Wow! That was a play,
and you were in it!
I was--
It was kind of a first-time
thing, but you know.
It's great.
You were great.
- A powerhouse.
- Really? You thought so?
Oh, thanks so much
for coming.
Listen, I gotta tell you something.
I thought that you
were gonna suck.
And, no, you were
phenomenal.
You were so good.
I feel so bad I even had those thoughts.
You made me cry.
I can't believe
everybody came!
- Steven.
- Oh, my goodness!
Mmm!
How'd you learn
all those lines?
I don't know.
My mom helped me with most of 'em.
Steve,
it was wonderful.
You were so...
there.
Thank you so much.
- Congratulations.
- I don't know who you are.
- Hey! How are ya?
- Hi!
You were amazing.
You were amazing.
You should be in the movies.
I mean it.
With this hair,
I don't think so.
No! You look great
blond.
The other actors,
they were great.
But you?
You, my friend...
you are why people
go to the theater.
Thanks.
