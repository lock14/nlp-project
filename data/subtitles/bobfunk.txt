1
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:21,052
Since the keeping of time, who hasn't
longed to shift the hands of the clock back?

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,521
Maybe to a general era,
maybe to a specific moment

3
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:26,524
to just before it all
started to slip away.

4
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:29,260
Now, my time machine cannot
place you on that one day.

5
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:31,997
It cannot find for you
the critical moment,

6
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:34,165
the nexus of the tragic flow,

7
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:37,401
but it can transport you
back to a time

8
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,671
when the blood ran hot
in your veins

9
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,240
and your sleep
was deep in dreams.

10
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:44,709
- What?
- Honey.

11
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:47,007
Now, my time machine can
give you all this,

12
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,715
and for half the price
of a conventional mattress.

13
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:52,483
- Jesus.
- Honey.

14
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:55,754
Hang in there, little man.
The grownups are talking.

15
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:59,524
Now this is the gold standard.
Our platinum line.

16
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:02,927
- Mom, I don't want a futon.
- It's a cotton mattress, tenderfoot.

17
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:05,830
Let me save you a lot of
heartache over the next 20 years.

18
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,832
Wanting's got nothing
to do with it.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,168
When I was your age,
I wanted to be a fire truck.

20
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:12,103
Yeah? And I want
a real bed.

21
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:20,311
Yeah, and I wanted a wife that
didn't sleep with other men.

22
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,246
- What?
- If "ifs" and "buts" were candy and nuts,

23
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:25,116
every day would be Christmas, and the
both of us would be banging supermodels.

24
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:28,053
- You follow my thread, cupcake?
- That's it. We're leaving.

25
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:31,856
What?

26
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:36,895
Shit.

27
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:38,897
And why does he
need a real bed?

28
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:41,800
It's gonna be another 15 years before
he knows how to properly fuck on it.

29
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:43,902
You know what it is?
I'll tell you what it is.

30
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,704
It's the glorification
of youth.

31
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,538
And you say,
"Bob, so what?

32
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:50,141
So what if we're
a culture of youth worship?"

33
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:53,678
Well, say I, consider the Hitler Youth.
Or the Khmer Rouge.

34
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,248
- Can I get a witness on this? Smiley.
- I am nothing if not a witness.

35
00:01:57,316 --> 00:01:59,517
And what do the young
know about anything anyway?

36
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:01,385
Not one thing.

37
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,654
Brewer, what did you know
when you were 20?

38
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,489
- Not one thing.
- And now?

39
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:07,258
- Everything.
- Defense rests.

40
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:08,960
Might as well
glorify cardboard.

41
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,996
Glorify sand.
It's all the same thing.

42
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:14,199
Present company
excepted, honey.

43
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:16,534
I hope Smiley
carded you.

44
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,669
I'm 23.

45
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,372
Uh-huh.
And I'm Cab Calloway.

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,640
Welcome to
The Cotton Club.

47
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,776
Tall,
tan, and terrific.

48
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,879
Hey, uh, don't you
usually come in here

49
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,115
with a big guy,
what's his name?

50
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:32,717
- Adam.
- Yeah, Adam.

51
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,285
Hmm. Where's he tonight?

52
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,056
Well, I got
about 20 minutes.

53
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,959
Slide down here and tell me the
story of your very young life.

54
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,272
Ahh...

55
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,059
Share the sidewalk,
asshole!

56
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,961
It's not a weapon, lady!

57
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:58,263
Hi, my name is Bob.

58
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,464
Hi, Bob.

59
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,700
It's been 30 seconds
since my last drink.

60
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,436
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye.

61
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:07,705
Ms. Funk, there's
a woman here to see you.

62
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:10,674
- What now?
- I think it's about Bob.

63
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:22,020
Yeah, that--
that door's a push.

64
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,391
Thank you.

65
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,861
- You all right there?
- Yeah, fine.

66
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,098
- Push, pull, pull, push.
- Yeah. Very confusing.

67
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,167
Yeah.
Have a great day.

68
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,403
Huh? Yeah.
Yeah, you, too.

69
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:42,407
Fifty percent off
anything on the floor.

70
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,142
Sure.

71
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,643
Glad to see you
back with us.

72
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,847
That 50 percent is coming off
your commission this month.

73
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:52,183
If you even have any.

74
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,919
Did you actually tell
that woman about Theresa?

75
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,822
Theresa? What?
What about her?

76
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,892
She said you were talking
about your cheating ex-wife.

77
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,195
What? No.

78
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:09,100
Uh, listen, can we...
can we talk about this later?

79
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,103
Robert, tomorrow morning,
8:30 sharp, my office.

80
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,904
- 8:30. Sharp!
- Yeah.

81
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,536
Ahh...

82
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,676
Come on!

83
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:54,645
Like clockwork.

84
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,785
Morning, Bob.

85
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:05,556
- Hey, Bob, are you a friend of Bill's?
- I got enough friends.

86
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,492
Name one.

87
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,403
It's very, very sexy.

88
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,904
So, who is the guy?

89
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:23,408
Friend of a friend.
He owns a dozen doughnut shops.

90
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,710
Huh. It's funny.

91
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:29,180
Well, anyway, I should
get to the office, so...

92
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,581
Good luck tonight.

93
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,518
- Thanks for the sweater, hon.
- Absolutely.

94
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:36,954
- What time is it?
- Quarter past 9:00.

95
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:42,826
I told him.
8:30 a.m., sharp.

96
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,730
This is where
the magic happens.

97
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:48,332
Jean, Sonny,
Ms. Thorne.

98
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,800
- How you doing?
- I'm done.

99
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,001
Nice to meet you.

100
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,603
She knows.

101
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:55,039
That's how it goes.
Funk Foam and Futon. Please hold.

102
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,507
Oh, hold the elevator.

103
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:04,182
- Hey, who's that?
- Oh, that's the new kid.

104
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:05,104
She's pretty, huh?

105
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:07,385
I think she's being
groomed to replace you, Bob.

106
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:13,524
I'll probably have to use
a coach for the accent.

107
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:19,464
<i>...Canterbury Tales</i>
and <i>Don Quix-- Don Quix--</i>

108
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:22,933
Hi, Bob. I was just saying that I might
get to do the lead in this play.

109
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:26,204
I was telling her
it was kind of a cross between

110
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,439
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>
and <i>Don Quixote.</i>

111
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,808
It's a real brainy,
very brainy, very,

112
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,743
you know, very old-timey.

113
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:36,080
I'll probably have to use a coach for the--
to do the accents and--

114
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,249
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

115
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,784
This is Ms. Thorne.
This is Mr. Funk.

116
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:41,852
- Ms. Thorne.
- Hi.

117
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,287
Nice to meet you.

118
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,888
You got a--

119
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:47,125
- Yeah.
- I don't wanna--

120
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:50,161
- Now, no-- Uh-- Just let me--
- Um... Oh, okay.

121
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,529
- Let me-- Oh.
- Thank you.

122
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,963
- Ow. I'm sorry, sorry.
- Ow, thank you.

123
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:54,599
- Thank you.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

124
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,934
Here you go.

125
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,569
- There you--
- Hey, thanks.

126
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:02,006
So, it's really
old-timey stuff because--

127
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:06,944
I, um-- Anyway, I--
Back to the salt mines, 'cause I gotta--

128
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,194
It was nice to meet you.

129
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:10,214
Nice to meet you,Steve.
Good luck today.

130
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,818
So...

131
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,521
Ms. Thorne.

132
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:18,456
Ruthie?

133
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,124
Right here.

134
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,160
Page Robert for me, please.

135
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,394
Doing it.

136
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:27,097
Which is not to say that
you have no rights at all.

137
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,367
- That's not the way we do things here.
- <i>Bob Funk to Admin.</i>

138
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,901
That's not American.

139
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,637
I don't even think
that's legal.

140
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:35,406
- <i>Bob Funk to Admin.</i>
- Is that for you?

141
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,408
<i>Bob Funk to Admin, please.</i>

142
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,842
The chain of command
is simple.

143
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,212
Up here you have
the upper management.

144
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,846
Down here
you have the, uh,

145
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:46,450
secretaries,
janitorial and the like,

146
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:49,086
and around the center here
you have yourself

147
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:51,355
and other lesser, uh,

148
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,257
Middle management?

149
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:55,626
Precisely.
Middle management.

150
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:57,895
Or as we like to call it
here at Funk Foam and Futon,

151
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,530
upper support.

152
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:06,070
Sonny and Jean say he's here,
but he didn't answer the page.

153
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:09,540
I'd go, but I've got an online
doctor's appointment in five minutes.

154
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:12,410
- Oh, go.
- I saw him talking to the new kid.

155
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,314
- Uh--
- That was good.

156
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,283
Did you change
your clothes, Steve?

157
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:22,587
What?
Smelled like Bob.

158
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,488
That's--

159
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:27,358
Uh, I'm sor--
I didn't mean to snatch it away.

160
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,827
It's--
This is a--

161
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:32,796
This is a--
an executive clipboard.

162
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,600
And so there might have been
a confidential directive--

163
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,901
What do you do here, exactly?

164
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:39,103
Uh, V.P. of sales.

165
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,905
Vice president of sales?

166
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:44,942
Yeah, I made that leap.

167
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,510
Huh.

168
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,546
Anyway, the point is, uh,

169
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,814
maybe you'd like
to grab a bite some evening.

170
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:51,815
Tonight?

171
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:53,684
Tomorrow?

172
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:57,521
Whenever. Be happy to go over
the ins and outs of the shop.

173
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,823
Not a date, necessarily,

174
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:02,660
but it never hurts to have
a friend on the inside.

175
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,796
- Good morning, Robert.
- Good morning.

176
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:09,300
Uh, have you
met Ms. Thorne?

177
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,335
Yes. I hired her.

178
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:14,037
Did you forget
our meeting?

179
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,939
Yeah. I'll be there
in two shakes.

180
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:19,109
Actually,
we need you there now.

181
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:21,011
All right, I'll be there
in one shake.

182
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,681
I want you to stop
harassing this woman...

183
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:28,018
and get into my office, please.

184
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:29,987
Excuse me? I--
Was I harassing you?

185
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:32,490
I was standing right here.

186
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,558
Well, this is
an A and B conversation,

187
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:36,160
and you're the letter C!

188
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,862
Oh, no.

189
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:41,999
- That actually hurts.
- Come on.

190
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,137
Are you
out of your mind?

191
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,774
I was just...
welcoming that girl.

192
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,475
You were harassing that girl,

193
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,144
and you were supposed to be
here with me 45 minutes ago.

194
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:57,181
- You act like you're gonna spank me.
- I should. Look at you.

195
00:11:57,248 --> 00:12:01,118
You look like something
the cat wouldn't even touch.

196
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,187
You wore that yesterday,
didn't you?

197
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,555
Did you even
go home last night?

198
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,290
And that relates
to work how?

199
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,994
You are on very thin ice,
and you're slipping.

200
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,930
Your people skills
are abominable.

201
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:16,834
Your sales suck, and if you
want to continue to work here,

202
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,870
you're gonna have to
change your ways.

203
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,372
Now.

204
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,380
Ronald, Ms. Thorne,
if you would.

205
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:39,122
All right. Apologize.

206
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,892
To whom?

207
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,828
Do I need to be here
for this?

208
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:47,498
Yes. To Ms. Thorne.
For harassing her.

209
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,200
- But I didn't harass her!
- Oh, really, that's not necessary.

210
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:52,936
- I'm not comfortable with apologies.
- Thank you.

211
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:54,672
Apologize.

212
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,375
- Some big brouhaha, huh?
- How's your mother, Steve?

213
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,677
Huh? Oh, I got
that ointment you suggested,

214
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,713
and the fatty tumors,
they cleared right up.

215
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,615
What's really going on?

216
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,498
Steve! Please!

217
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:08,118
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go over here.

218
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,453
Bob, come on!

219
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,521
Come on what?

220
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,456
Say the words, Robert.

221
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:17,661
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

222
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:20,330
I said I don't know what to you,
and I shouldn't have said it.

223
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,332
If I could take it back,
I would.

224
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,503
If you would like to flay
the flesh from my back,

225
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,372
then please feel free
to do so!

226
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:34,177
'Cause I'm so sorry
I thought about fucking you!

227
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:36,313
I'm so unbelievably sorry!

228
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,116
Oh, my God.

229
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,152
Happy?

230
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,155
Robert, you're fired.

231
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:22,259
People? Fuck people.
People are shit.

232
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,695
You wanna know what it is?
I'll tell you what it is.

233
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:29,066
Futons. Okay?
That's what we do.

234
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:33,236
People are kinda integral to
the whole mercantile thing, Bob.

235
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:36,373
People, after all,
are the people who buy futons.

236
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:39,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, people.
Blah, blah, blah, people.

237
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,312
Fine, Ron, but Bob's
not a people person.

238
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,882
Tell the world.
Bob's not a people person!

239
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,619
What's happening with you?
You're acting like a loser lately.

240
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,054
You know?
A real loser, Bob.

241
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:53,724
Like someone
who has actually lost.

242
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,559
How flattering.

243
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:58,095
I don't mean
that you are a loser,

244
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:59,597
you're just acting
like a loser.

245
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:00,965
Forget I said it.

246
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:02,967
I can't forget it, Ron.
It's out there.

247
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:05,135
Where? Out where?

248
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:07,137
What?

249
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,206
I'm sorry, I was, uh--

250
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:12,442
Your table's kind of large. I was
wondering if you could share your seat.

251
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,245
- Sure.
- Oh, Ron, did you hear?

252
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:18,148
Mr. Gotrocks here
wants to join us.

253
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,150
Oh, oh, please,
would you?

254
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:21,685
My life is in tatters,

255
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,721
and I can think
of nothing I'd like more

256
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:26,089
than to share
this moment with you!

257
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,028
Wha-- Hey! Hey!
Don't make me beg!

258
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:33,330
- Cut it out!
- You know what my first impulse was?

259
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:37,100
To tell her to go fuck herself because
I can get a better job anywhere in town.

260
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:40,170
Because I'm a contributor. Remember
last fall? I was selling 2,000 a day.

261
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:41,772
Remember? A day!

262
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,873
Uh-huh.

263
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,113
Can you talk to her?

264
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,152
You know how tough she can be
once she makes up her mind.

265
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:57,220
Just fuck "tough"
for me, Ron?

266
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:01,491
She likes you better.
Okay? There, I said it.

267
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,493
My mortification
is complete.

268
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:07,364
Mom has always liked you better,
and she'll do it if you ask her.

269
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,132
She doesn't like me better.

270
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,771
Please.

271
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:19,977
It's all so romantic,
isn't it? This misery.

272
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:22,780
Welcome to my decline.

273
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:24,448
Thank you for having me.

274
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:33,657
- Hey.
- Hey!

275
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:46,904
You, uh, ever chew a piece of
gum so long you hate yourself?

276
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,842
Okay.

277
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,853
Huh?

278
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:07,424
I'm just fucking with you.

279
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:10,995
Oh.

280
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,896
Very good. Yeah.

281
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:16,100
Smiley. Another box of chablis
for the young lady.

282
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:36,219
Unbelievable.

283
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:39,623
Sh--

284
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,728
May we come in?

285
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:55,539
Hmm...

286
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,211
How long
have you lived here?

287
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,780
Almost two years.

288
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,949
When you gonna
move in?

289
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,317
Ha-ha.

290
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:12,923
Ron was quite eloquent
on your behalf,

291
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,226
so I've reconsidered.

292
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:19,329
So, you will step down
as V.P. of sales

293
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:22,232
for a period
of no less than 90 days.

294
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,902
You will track sales
for the stores here in town

295
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,837
and the Pacoima outfit.

296
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:30,774
Ms. Thorne will supervise
this probationary period.

297
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:36,346
Fantastic. Track sales,
report to Minnie Mouse.

298
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:37,781
Glad to do it.

299
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,683
Bob...

300
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,087
Sorry. Sorry.

301
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:44,588
As you wish.

302
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:49,059
There is one more thing. This is
as your mother now, not your boss.

303
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,228
You need to get some help.

304
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:55,498
I want you to see a therapist.
Someone who--

305
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:01,138
Hi.

306
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,474
Hi.

307
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,946
I was thinking I'd go.

308
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:15,219
Oh!

309
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:17,121
Here you go.

310
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:18,555
Thanks.

311
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,994
See ya.

312
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,428
Bye.

313
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:34,471
Are you kidding?
She's a child.

314
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:37,875
What?
She's twenty...two.

315
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,843
Old enough to drink.
She can take care of herself.

316
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:42,679
Okay. I'm back
to being the boss.

317
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:46,483
Therapy is not requested.
It's required.

318
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,887
You can see anyone you like,
provided she's a woman.

319
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:54,158
You have got to let go of
Theresa and get on with your life.

320
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:57,661
What? Hold on? What?
You want me to be more up-and-up?

321
00:19:57,728 --> 00:20:01,131
Uh, fine. Watch my mouth,
punch the clock, whatever.

322
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,533
Sky's the limit.
But a shrink?

323
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:05,368
People will talk.

324
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:07,437
Take it or leave it.

325
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:18,515
Can I keep
my office at least?

326
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:31,094
Machines, clothing, family,

327
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:33,430
flavor, pleasure--
it all wears out, Smiley.

328
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:35,199
It's entropy.

329
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:39,569
The logic of decay.

330
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:43,473
There's no man for whom pleasure
has ever been continuous.

331
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:46,176
Not even as a child?

332
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,445
I had no childhood, Bob.

333
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,855
And hello to you.

334
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,994
I don't know you.
Chardonnay.

335
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:07,998
This has been
a good, good day.

336
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,722
What? What is that?
That smell?

337
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,427
- Potpourri?
- Yeah. Yeah.

338
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:39,963
Gotta say,
not fooled.

339
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:43,733
Lemony zest,
misty vanilla morning, whatever.

340
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:46,336
Makes me think
of public toilets.

341
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:47,670
I see.

342
00:21:47,738 --> 00:21:49,940
Which is not to say that
it smells like ass in here.

343
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,775
It does not.
It smells like potpourri.

344
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:54,177
And that makes me think
that you're hiding something.

345
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,581
Because you know what it is?
I'll tell you.

346
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:01,684
Psychiatry
is like alchemy.

347
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:04,922
Trying to define human behavior is
like trying to turn lead into gold,

348
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:07,090
which we now know
cannot be done.

349
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:11,361
I'm only here as part
of a deal I made,

350
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:14,231
which we're not discussing
because that's personal.

351
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,435
I don't need
some woman to-- Oop.

352
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:20,237
Pardon my French.

353
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,705
I mean, I don't need
some person-- hmm?--

354
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:25,842
to tell me that just because my mother
didn't teach me to wipe myself correctly,

355
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,244
I'm suddenly dysfunctional.

356
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,347
And I have quirks.
That makes me human.

357
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,515
But if being human
makes you crazy,

358
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,751
then get out your straitjacket
and lock me away.

359
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:38,855
Do you everyone who sees
a therapist is crazy?

360
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:40,723
No. I never said that.

361
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,459
It's-- Hey.
Therapy?

362
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:43,994
Just not something
I need.

363
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:49,899
I think everyone,
no matter how well-adjusted,

364
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,169
can benefit
from a little therapy.

365
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,771
Yes, well, of course you'd think that.
You're a therapist.

366
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,974
That's like a baker saying
everyone needs to eat cake,

367
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,742
which is not true,
because some people are fat.

368
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:03,813
The Japanese have slept on
these for over 10,000 years.

369
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:05,782
Not this exact futon,
mind you.

370
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,151
Oh, no!

371
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:10,153
Not this one.

372
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,155
Although we do
have one in the back

373
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:14,524
that the Japanese
have slept on for a--

374
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:16,493
almost, uh--
how long, Sonny?

375
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,528
That one's relatively new.

376
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:22,265
I think that one's only been slept on for
maybe fourteen-- fifteen hundred years.

377
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,034
- Wow!
- Yeah.

378
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:28,338
- Now, the Osaka mat.
- Oh, the Osaka.

379
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,041
Hey, were you here
when we had the Osaka?

380
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,711
Is that the one Ms. Funk
gave to the Smithsonian?

381
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:36,646
Exactly.

382
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:39,549
- And then it goes back to Peking.
- Peking?

383
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:44,021
Because of the post-Maoist
Cultural Heritage Laws...

384
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:47,124
regarding
<i>Japanese</i> antiquities.

385
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:49,292
- Oh...
- Yeah.

386
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,262
The point is,
I think we have something

387
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,966
that will easily last
until you get married again.

388
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,369
You have a problem
with Rorschach?

389
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:02,939
Not per se, but I was hoping for
something a little more up-to-date

390
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:04,841
in the way
of psychoanalytic tools.

391
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,211
But what do I know?
Give me your best spot.

392
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:10,180
Get it?

393
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,682
Like ink spot?
It's a joke?

394
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,451
Yes, I got it.

395
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,687
And no, I don't think
everything has to be a joke.

396
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:20,123
Okay. Hit me.

397
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,994
That?
It's a small penis.

398
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,298
Large cave
of some sort.

399
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:32,835
It's a... small penis.

400
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:34,404
Hmm.

401
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,240
Small penis.

402
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:41,945
Small penis.

403
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:46,683
Oh. That's a squirrel...

404
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,819
running up the side
of a very small penis.

405
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:56,659
Hey, I was kidding.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

406
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:59,496
I was kidding about
the penises, Dr. Day.

407
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,431
You know that, right?
What are you writing?

408
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,433
Are you writing that he was
kidding about the penises?

409
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,970
Rorschach isn't a method, Ron.
It's a parlor trick.

410
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:11,040
It's like I went in for a shot of penicillin,
and she threw a bunch of leeches on my back.

411
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,976
And she's too good-looking
to be a shrink.

412
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:15,078
- So don't go back.
- Don't go back.

413
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,914
I have to go back, Ron.
She took copious notes.

414
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:20,283
Who knows what she'd do
if she felt I betrayed her.

415
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,121
And she came highly recommended.

416
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:27,457
Hey, Bobby. What do you
think about Ms. Thorne?

417
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,093
- She's nice, huh?
- Oh, yeah, she's a real peach.

418
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,162
And she smells great.

419
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,333
I don't know if it's one of those oils,
or it's perfume or what,

420
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,401
but I touched her earlier,
her shoulder.

421
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:39,869
I can still smell her.

422
00:25:39,937 --> 00:25:41,838
It's--

423
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:43,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pull up there, big shooter.

424
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:45,442
You have a wife,
and a good one.

425
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,511
As if it's as simple as that.

426
00:25:47,578 --> 00:25:50,713
No? Then explain it to me.

427
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:55,218
She does not touch me.

428
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:00,690
We sleep in the same bed
every night,

429
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:03,793
and it's like it's
been months since--

430
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,430
And I keep hoping,
you know, she'll--

431
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,367
Forget it.

432
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:14,837
Why didn't you tell me?
You think I was gonna make fun of you?

433
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:16,673
Just don't bust my chops
for the occasional fantasy.

434
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,543
- I'm a big boy, okay?
- You wouldn't have an affair.

435
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,678
My life is hard enough
as it is.

436
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:24,447
- What?
- I need a constant to anchor myself,

437
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:26,983
- and you and Janet are my--
- That's not my job!

438
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:29,219
You gotta be your own
anchor or whatever.

439
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:32,189
You know, I can
barely anchor myself,

440
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:34,291
much less
the two of us, so...

441
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:39,762
I'm sorry.

442
00:26:40,764 --> 00:26:41,731
Hey!

443
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,966
I got the part!
I got it!

444
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:47,404
The play. They just
called me here at work!

445
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:49,038
I got the part!

446
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:52,709
Hey! Ruth! I got the part!
Hey, Ruthie!

447
00:26:52,776 --> 00:26:56,279
Raymundo,
I got the part!

448
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:59,549
I mean, therapy is for people
who don't have friends.

449
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:04,887
Where the hell is everyone?

450
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,529
Oh, look. I get to throw myself
under a bus again.

451
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,763
Bob...

452
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,299
Miss?

453
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:19,336
May I buy you a drink?

454
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:28,811
I'd sooner drink
a quart of my own blood.

455
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,482
Now that I would pay to see.

456
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,658
Ha! Missed me!

457
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:46,296
Mr. Funk?

458
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:51,635
Mr. Funk?

459
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:58,241
Mr. Funk?

460
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,576
Sorry.

461
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:05,915
Uh... Hey. Sorry.
Surprised me. What's up?

462
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:07,651
Uh, okay, um,

463
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:10,787
these form 69-J's are
filled out incorrectly again.

464
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:14,991
Oh, Christ. Those are
the bane of my existence.

465
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:26,936
Are you all right?

466
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,206
Yeah.

467
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,713
Listen, uh, you won't mention
this to my mother, will you?

468
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,348
No.

469
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:43,019
Uh, but if they're filed wrong again,
we will get fined by the city.

470
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:47,123
- Duly noted.
- Okay. Bye.

471
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:51,260
- Hi, Ms. Thorne.
- Hi, Mr. Funk.

472
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:57,767
Oh, my God. Bob, you gotta
remember to change your clothes.

473
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,736
Gross.

474
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,070
Very funny.

475
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:05,475
Oh, there you are.
I'm off to Bangkok.

476
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,578
Bangkok?
Is that a joke?

477
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:12,415
Didn't you get the memo?
I'm on vacation next week.

478
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:15,218
Thailand. Asia.

479
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,954
Safe trip,
Ms. F.

480
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:20,056
Thank you, Steve.

481
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,729
- Ride's ready.
- Don't hover, dear.

482
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:32,635
Did I tell you I got
the part in the play?

483
00:29:32,703 --> 00:29:36,439
Hey, will you freshen up?
This is my office.

484
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,180
- Have a great trip, Ms. Funk.
- Thank you, Jean.

485
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:46,616
- Safe travels.
- Thanks, Sonny.

486
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,855
Her highness
has left the building.

487
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:54,190
I hear she's off to her
castle on Mean Mountain

488
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:57,026
to feast off the flesh
of innocents.

489
00:29:57,094 --> 00:30:01,030
Hey, I'm not sure you pressed
this area out right here.

490
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:03,232
I thought she was
going to Thailand.

491
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,941
Oh, 69-J's, huh?

492
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:16,646
- Yeah.
- Did Ms. Thorne sign off on those?

493
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,516
Give me a little credit,
huh? Okay?

494
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:26,656
How's the, uh, the thing?
The Janet thing.

495
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,625
What?
I'm trying to help.

496
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:31,260
I know, but you
know what? Don't.

497
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:34,330
Don't help. Physician,
heal thyself, you know?

498
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:36,098
Meaning what?

499
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:40,637
Meaning you can smell the liquor
from three cubicles down, Bobby.

500
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:43,005
I haven't had one drop yet today.
Not one drop!

501
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:46,042
It doesn't matter.
It's coming off of you like...

502
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:49,612
like Grandma Dorothy
with her Manhattans at the club.

503
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,947
You remember that?

504
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:54,451
I can't win.

505
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:58,187
Come on.

506
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:00,189
- Where you going?
- Post office.

507
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:02,992
Is that okay?
Keeping tabs on me now?

508
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:05,562
You're keeping tabs
on me for Mom.

509
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:08,064
Bobby, come on!

510
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:10,399
You know what I need from you
from this point on? Nothing!

511
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,335
I can do this,
all of this, myself.

512
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:15,171
I went to college with
Dave Bernstein at Dreamy's.

513
00:31:15,238 --> 00:31:18,240
One call! People all over town
are saying nice things about me.

514
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:19,843
All the time I'm getting
calls from people,

515
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,445
"Love to work with you, if you
can cut yourself free of the tit!"

516
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:23,646
Hey, hey, come on!

517
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:25,982
It's biblical, this story.

518
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,351
The mother both brothers need,
brother against brother.

519
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:29,752
This is good material.

520
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,690
Hey, Steve! You should be
writing this shit down, my man!

521
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:35,959
Hey, Bob,
welcome back.

522
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,961
We hung out
with your new boss.

523
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:40,162
We may like her even better
than we like you, Bob.

524
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,931
You like everybody
better than me.

525
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,099
Well!

526
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:46,002
It's true.

527
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:48,070
But so impolite
to bring it up.

528
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,341
Oh, uh, no.

529
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,377
No, you.

530
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:59,115
Go. Please go.

531
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:07,189
- I'll make some more.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

532
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:10,760
- But I can make fresh.
- This is still good, right?

533
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:21,838
What happened?

534
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:26,776
I don't know. Maybe the acid in the coffee
did something to the thing in the thing.

535
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:33,783
Excuse me. Are you actually
reading <i>Moby Dick?</i>

536
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,719
Yeah, I'm getting
an accounting certification.

537
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:41,490
Why do I always
do stuff like this?

538
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,493
I think Bob and Ms. Thorne
make a cute couple, don't you?

539
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,495
What? You think
she'd go for him?

540
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,098
I don't know.
She's that type.

541
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,399
What type?

542
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:54,270
The type that goes for,
uh, potential.

543
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:57,774
Hey, look. There's a lot of
people with potential in the world.

544
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:01,177
I don't think Bob
is one of them. Okay?

545
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:03,079
- Okay. Sure.
- Okay.

546
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:06,482
American lit?

547
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,250
It's not required.

548
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:12,354
I just wanted something with a
little human spirit in it, you know?

549
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:15,692
- And I like whales.
- Don't read the end.

550
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:18,695
Now I feel bad because your
mom's paying for half my tuition,

551
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:21,598
so I kind of feel like
I'm defrauding her, you know?

552
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:24,533
And then I trash
the coffee maker.

553
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,535
Jesus.

554
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,671
Well, don't worry
about it.

555
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:32,208
We got, like, ten
of those things on sale.

556
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:35,277
And as far as
the class goes, well...

557
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:37,513
it'll be our secret.

558
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,650
Thank you.

559
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:46,022
Smart.

560
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,690
It's okay.

561
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,760
Yeah, I think
you killed it.

562
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:54,563
- Guess I'll have tea.
- Yeah.

563
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,633
I'll make it.

564
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:06,575
By the way, your
sweater's on inside out.

565
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,523
- Don't work too late. Good night.
- I won't. Good night.

566
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:32,101
Ah, Christ!

567
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:35,571
- Oh!
- Jesus!

568
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,573
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

569
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:37,947
Sorry.

570
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:40,242
My heart actually stopped
there for a second.

571
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,912
I am so sorry. Yeah.

572
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:49,418
Hey, did you get a chance
to finish up those form 69-J's?

573
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:51,220
- Mailed them out today.
- Oh.

574
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:55,257
Uh, did you keep a file copy?
Because I never saw them, you know.

575
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:56,693
On my desk.

576
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,594
Okay.

577
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:01,898
You pulling
some O.T.?

578
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:06,669
Um... Well, I was
drinking some tea,

579
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:10,573
but I managed to spill an
entire cupful into my keyboard.

580
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,342
Do you think I ruined it,
the keyboard?

581
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,477
It was just
herbal tea, but--

582
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:17,213
Herbal tea.
Like it makes a difference.

583
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,016
Yeah. I'm sure
it'll be fine.

584
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,988
This elevator
doesn't seem to be working.

585
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:29,125
I can just walk up.
I'm just going up to the roof.

586
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,229
- Uh, why?
- To throw myself off, actually.

587
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:35,598
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

588
00:35:35,665 --> 00:35:38,935
I like to go up sometimes
just to look at the stars.

589
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:41,871
Oh. Okay.

590
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:45,574
Would you like
to come with?

591
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,911
Uh... really?

592
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,113
Why not?

593
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,215
My folks were big campers.

594
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:56,152
I would just lay out
and watch the stars all night.

595
00:35:58,622 --> 00:36:00,623
In August,
there's meteor showers.

596
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,725
One night I saw
33 shooting stars.

597
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,027
Really?

598
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:06,996
You know, I don't think
I've ever seen one.

599
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:13,035
It's comforting, isn't it?

600
00:36:13,103 --> 00:36:16,405
How inconceivably huge
the universe is.

601
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:21,878
Comforting?
It's terrifying.

602
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:23,179
Yeah.

603
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:28,251
But... just against
something so infinite,

604
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:31,220
nothing with our lives
can seem so...

605
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:33,322
consequential.

606
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:36,959
Huh.

607
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:41,497
Your brother told me you and he
used to go camping with your mom.

608
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:44,767
Yeah. Well...

609
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,869
My father died
when we were little,

610
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:50,206
so she was always trying to
be the dad, too, you know?

611
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:53,475
We'd usually
end up in a hotel.

612
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:04,120
You two are, uh, friendly,
you and my brother?

613
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,255
He's a sweet guy.

614
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,760
He's sweet? Hmm?

615
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,429
He's sweet?

616
00:37:13,496 --> 00:37:15,898
- Did I say something wrong?
- He's married.

617
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:17,766
And he's thinking
about you a lot!

618
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:18,901
Okay. Whoa.

619
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:20,436
Ronnie and Janet--

620
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:21,704
Who's Ronnie?

621
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:23,206
My brother.

622
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:25,774
And Janet, his wife, they've
been together forever,

623
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,343
and she's like a sister.

624
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,911
And he's thinking
about you--

625
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:30,279
Aren't you married?

626
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,316
Uh, well, I was.

627
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:35,384
And you never once
thought about another woman?

628
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,055
That's different.
She's good to him.

629
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,325
Your wife wasn't
good to you?

630
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,664
She... She took up
with another guy.

631
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:51,033
She left me
to be with him.

632
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:53,035
I'm sorry.

633
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:56,472
I know what that's like.

634
00:37:57,807 --> 00:38:00,343
- You do?
- I do.

635
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,213
But I don't think
about your brother that way.

636
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:07,783
And to be fair to him,
thinking isn't a crime.

637
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,289
Thank God.

638
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,457
I'd be on death row,
you know what I mean?

639
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:19,228
That was a joke.

640
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:21,330
Oh, I know.
I just didn't laugh.

641
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:31,774
Thinking may not be a crime, but...
wishes can be dangerous things.

642
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:34,676
What do you wish for
that's so dangerous?

643
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:39,916
That I didn't
talk so much. You?

644
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,786
Oh, that I didn't
break everything.

645
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:45,988
Remind me never
to give you my heart.

646
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,503
I'm sorry. That was wrong.
I shouldn't have said that.

647
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:51,227
No. No, no, no, no.

648
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,561
That was
inappropriate.

649
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:53,996
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.

650
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:56,132
- But, uh-- You?
- No, I'm gonna stay here.

651
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,499
Okay. Good night.

652
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,268
Yeah. Ms. Thorne?

653
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,669
Yeah?

654
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:07,609
Do you think we
could ever be friends?

655
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:09,245
Oh, well...

656
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,414
stranger things
have happened.

657
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,352
Ow!

658
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,586
Are you okay?

659
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:19,155
I'm okay.

660
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,126
Then when I was 14,
I dated a girl named Lisa.

661
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:26,429
She was full
through the hips.

662
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:28,164
Cute overbite.

663
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:31,700
I broke up with her.
I don't remember why.

664
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:35,371
Later, she was absent
from school a great deal.

665
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,506
I believe the two
are unrelated.

666
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,512
Then I lost the weight and
started dating the "pretty" girls.

667
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:47,416
Jeez, I almost said
the "normal" girls.

668
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:49,185
I'm a sick man.

669
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:50,886
Yes, you are.

670
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:56,558
Just trying to find that thread
that ties it all together.

671
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,529
One minute I'm losing
my mind, the next,

672
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:02,764
God is looking
right at me, but...

673
00:40:02,832 --> 00:40:04,133
just a glance.

674
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,903
That's the nature
of God, Bob.

675
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:13,509
Chardonnay.

676
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:18,714
Feel a powerful mojo
comin' on.

677
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:22,518
Suppose it'd kill you
to be a little sweeter?

678
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,521
Go fuck your mother.

679
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:32,294
Hear that? Some women, they pop off,
they expect us to be gents about it.

680
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:34,359
It's like they forget
we can beat them up.

681
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:34,963
Okay, come on.

682
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,100
Would it kill you
to just talk to me?

683
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:40,469
Enough.

684
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:45,641
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Smiley.

685
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,009
I'm sorry.

686
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:56,185
Weird fuckin' world, huh?

687
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,987
Hey, sister, you wanna buy a
ticket to this weird fuckin' world?

688
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,656
You wanna drop dead?

689
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:04,760
Yeah.

690
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:13,469
So I'm at the hot dog cart today and
I'm thinking about my crappy sales

691
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,837
and how I'm not
getting any younger.

692
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:18,274
I don't want to end up
one of those sad sacks,

693
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:22,611
sitting in a diner with an early-bird
hamburger and a free senior coffee.

694
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:27,216
And here's the what. I used to think that
drinking coffee with a hamburger was bizarre.

695
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,750
Now I don't mind it.

696
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:32,288
Which all goes to say that
aging is mystifying and a horror.

697
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:36,625
Anyway, there I am in line,
ruminating on my mounting failures

698
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:38,561
and my imminent decline,

699
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:40,496
when the Arab guy goes,
"Who's next?"

700
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,299
And I go, "I am,"
you know, because I am,

701
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:46,469
when this bike messenger says,
"Gimme an orange drink."

702
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:48,804
Just blurts it out like that.
"Gimme an orange drink."

703
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:51,540
And the Arab--
Israeli, Persian, whatever--

704
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:52,975
he gets it for him.

705
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:54,676
Then he takes
my order.

706
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:58,214
Me, I want two hot dogs.
Onions, relish, no mustard.

707
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:00,449
I fuckin' hate mustard.
Except with ham.

708
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,118
And then only
if it's honey mustard,

709
00:42:02,185 --> 00:42:04,086
but believe me,
Mr. Saheem Sahbip

710
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,089
doesn't have any honey mustard,
you know what I mean?

711
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:10,392
Oh, I'm sorry.

712
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,994
Am I boring you?

713
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:14,130
- Bob--
- No, no, no. Please, please.

714
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:16,398
Feel free to stretch
right out and go to sleep,

715
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:19,235
and old boring Uncle Bob will tell you
a nice "sweepy wittle" bedtime story

716
00:42:19,302 --> 00:42:20,669
from his ho-hum life.

717
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:22,070
Bob, it's not that.

718
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,840
Staring at me with those
big, sleepy green eyes,

719
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:26,975
begging me, "Oh, God,
Bob, be interesting.

720
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:29,378
Please, God. Bob, tell me
something good for once."

721
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,147
It's nothing personal,
I promise.

722
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:33,815
No, no. That was
a suppressed yawn of boredom.

723
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:35,884
I saw it
with my own two eyes.

724
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:39,888
I pay you, okay?
You work for me, Dr. Freud.

725
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:41,290
Bottom line!

726
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:46,228
Feel better?

727
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,097
A little.

728
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,300
Anyway, after
the hot dog incident--

729
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:54,002
let's refer to it from now on
as the "hot dog incident,"

730
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,738
because I don't wanna
plumb the depths of the--

731
00:42:56,806 --> 00:42:59,241
Anyway, I see
this guy today. Old guy.

732
00:42:59,309 --> 00:42:59,563
Yes?

733
00:42:59,564 --> 00:43:02,744
He's dancing out in the
middle of Parthenia Avenue

734
00:43:02,812 --> 00:43:06,748
with a big piece of cardboard on his
chest that says, "Jesus, I love you."

735
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:09,151
And I'm like,
"Hello! Hello in there!

736
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,887
He apparently doesn't
love you, you yammerin' fuck!"

737
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:16,124
I mean, why would I be wandering
the streets like some kind of dunce

738
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,227
if Jesus loved him?

739
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,995
You know?

740
00:43:20,063 --> 00:43:22,931
Why did you feel
like it was you?

741
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:26,202
What? Why did I
think who was me?

742
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:33,475
Well, you said, "Why would <i>I</i>
be wandering the streets

743
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:36,212
like <i>You know,</i> of dunce
if Je<i>perhaps you heard that.</i>

744
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:38,947
Perhaps you nodded off there
briefly and dreamt it,

745
00:43:39,015 --> 00:43:40,749
but I did not say that I--

746
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:43,051
Let's talk instead for
a minute about listening.

747
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,754
Okay?
Let's talk about respect.

748
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:48,691
I'm sorry, Bob, it--
it is time.

749
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:51,893
I know. I know.

750
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:54,029
The big hand's on the 12,
the little hand's on the 6.

751
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:57,533
Proud of me? I can tell time.
Bob's a time teller, everybody!

752
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:06,709
Can I come twice next week?

753
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:09,010
Bangkok is choked
with pollution,

754
00:44:09,078 --> 00:44:11,813
and the people
eat rats and bugs.

755
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:13,782
Jean said you went
to some mountain.

756
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,217
Was it
Shut Up Mountain?

757
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,018
Shouldn't you be
selling something?

758
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:20,222
How was your trip,
Mrs. Funk?

759
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,358
You're back already?
Jeez.

760
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:24,059
Welcome back, Ms. F.

761
00:44:24,127 --> 00:44:25,561
What'd you bring me?

762
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:28,230
I'll get that--
I'll get that for you.

763
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:32,834
- You met a guy?
- In Thailand?

764
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:35,837
Yes. Thanks.

765
00:44:35,905 --> 00:44:37,640
I'm not dead yet.

766
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:42,411
Oh, just, uh,
welcome home, Ms. F.

767
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,481
Thank you, Steve.
How's your mother?

768
00:44:45,548 --> 00:44:48,083
Oh, great, great.
She can feel her feet again.

769
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:49,618
So she's up and about.

770
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:51,320
Lovely.

771
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:55,223
Steve, did you tell the boys
about the $12,000 fine

772
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,626
the city has levied
against us?

773
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,827
I-- I was--

774
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:01,330
No, no.
I'll tell them.

775
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:07,068
12,000?
That's steep.

776
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:09,571
There were eight
misfiled forms,

777
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:13,975
which, according to the city,
can be construed as fraud.

778
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:18,380
You just have no chemistry
for business, Robert.

779
00:45:20,817 --> 00:45:23,485
I wish I knew what chemical
it is that I'm missing.

780
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:26,121
Just trying to do a job here.

781
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:29,558
Perhaps seeing it
as just a job

782
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,427
is the problem,
Robert.

783
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:34,396
Duly noted. Get more
personally involved.

784
00:45:34,464 --> 00:45:37,433
You're missing the point.
Business is business.

785
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,435
It is not personal.

786
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:42,404
And... you were on probation.

787
00:45:44,106 --> 00:45:46,141
Are you
firing me again?

788
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:48,043
Because I've done
everything you asked.

789
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,346
- The shrink?
- She's not.

790
00:45:50,413 --> 00:45:52,848
- You're not firing him.
- My mind is made up.

791
00:45:55,017 --> 00:45:59,421
I don't
want you to fire Bob, Mom.

792
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:01,423
Things aren't going too
well for Janet and I, and--

793
00:46:01,491 --> 00:46:02,825
Jesus, don't, Ron.

794
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:04,526
I couldn't take it.

795
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:07,896
Mom, please.
Make my life that much easier.

796
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:34,757
Plan and sweat
and toil of the earth,

797
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:37,626
but verily,
the greatest of thine plans

798
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,828
shall cometh to naught.

799
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:43,164
Life...

800
00:46:43,232 --> 00:46:45,100
is not a meritocracy, Bob.

801
00:46:46,135 --> 00:46:49,104
It's survival
of the fittest.

802
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:52,508
The rest... end up here.

803
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,146
You shouldn't be
so afraid.

804
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:02,083
What am I afraid of?

805
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:04,953
The attraction
you're feeling right now.

806
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:07,790
It's not your fault.

807
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:09,892
I got an extra gene.

808
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:12,127
Make me genetically
irresistible.

809
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:15,297
You're an asshole.

810
00:47:16,332 --> 00:47:17,699
Yeah.

811
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:19,835
But I'm
a charismatic asshole.

812
00:47:21,704 --> 00:47:23,972
Let me buy you a drink.

813
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:30,879
Why would I
let you do that?

814
00:47:32,114 --> 00:47:34,115
We've been enemies
long enough.

815
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:48,530
Here, here...

816
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:53,569
What the hell?

817
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:02,277
<i># Chills and fever #</i>

818
00:48:02,345 --> 00:48:06,114
<i># Chills and fever #</i>

819
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:12,454
<i># That's what I get</i>

820
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,857

821
00:48:17,827 --> 00:48:21,997
<i>- # Chills and fever #</i>
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

822
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:24,666
- Let me help you. Hurry.
- <i># Well, I love you, baby #</i>

823
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:28,737
<i># And there's nothing</i>
<i>that I can do #</i>

824
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,772
No. No, no, no.
That's not it. That's not it.

825
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,940
<i># Oh, Lord, I tremble #</i>

826
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:33,976

827
00:48:34,043 --> 00:48:36,645
<i>- # When you touch me #</i>

You seen my other shoe?
It's a black pump.

836
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:04,873
Huh. Black, red, magenta.

837
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:07,308
If it's a pump,
it probably belongs to you.

838
00:49:08,978 --> 00:49:11,079
Why don't you stay?
We can go to breakfast.

839
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:14,349
Look, um...

840
00:49:15,618 --> 00:49:18,286
I don't even remember
your name. Sorry.

841
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:20,956
It's, uh, it's Bob.

842
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,191
Yeah, um...

843
00:49:23,259 --> 00:49:25,126
I don't wanna spend
the night with you.

844
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:27,295
I don't wanna have
breakfast with you.

845
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:30,566
You had your shot.
It's on my stomach.

846
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,101
Well... let's try again.

847
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:35,236
What, have you
never done this before?

848
00:49:35,304 --> 00:49:38,306
You wanna be my man now?
You wanna be my big daddy?

849
00:49:38,374 --> 00:49:42,711
I let you fuck me,
so you win. Okay?

850
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,780
Can't you be happy
with that?

851
00:50:11,373 --> 00:50:13,341
<i>Bobby?</i>

852
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:16,044
- Yeah.
<i>- Mom has a job for you.</i>

853
00:50:20,683 --> 00:50:22,150
Fuck this!

854
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:23,919
It's all we've got open.
Seriously.

855
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:27,455
- This is an object lesson.
- Bob-- Maybe that, too.

856
00:50:30,493 --> 00:50:31,860
What about him?

857
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,195
Um, Mom's retiring him.

858
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:36,297
He'll show you
what to do. Sanjay?

859
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,168
Sanjay!

860
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:42,470
Christ, I thought
he was dead.

861
00:50:42,538 --> 00:50:45,140
They're finally
letting me retire.

862
00:50:45,207 --> 00:50:47,408
Did you know that
when I came to work he--

863
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:50,112
Hey.

864
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,782
You look like
Bob Funk.

865
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:56,718
Eh?

866
00:50:56,786 --> 00:50:58,353
He's disoriented.

867
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,554
Ah.

868
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:02,090
Get him off.
Get him off of me.

869
00:51:02,158 --> 00:51:03,525
- I love this boy.
- Sanjay...

870
00:51:20,943 --> 00:51:23,378
Hey! Get out of this!

871
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,592
Bobby!

872
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:12,594
<i>...Blue Jays</i>
<i>and the Yankees meet tonight--</i>

873
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:14,629
Bobby!

874
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:18,867
<i>Dave Stieb gets the start for the Jays,
while the Yanks send Guidry to the mound.</i>

875
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:26,875
<i>...after the Blue Jays stormed back in the
top of the ninth with 12 runs to win the game.</i>

876
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,911
Oh, thank God you're--
What happened to your face?

877
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:32,214
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?

878
00:52:32,281 --> 00:52:35,250
You've been missing
for nearly three days.

879
00:52:35,317 --> 00:52:38,620
- What? Days?
- What happened to your face?

880
00:52:40,823 --> 00:52:42,891
- Bob-- Bobby!
- Call you later.

881
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,427
Bobby!

882
00:52:48,697 --> 00:52:51,532
Bobby, if you don't talk
to me, I'll come back here.

883
00:52:52,935 --> 00:52:54,569
Bobby!

884
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:15,556
This is the story
of your life.

885
00:53:59,368 --> 00:54:02,470
- Come on, just chill.
- Fuck you!

886
00:55:16,678 --> 00:55:18,446
Ow.

887
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:20,415
Ah-- Oh.

888
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:31,092
Oh!

889
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:35,630
Oh, my God. You scared the hell
out of me. Christ, you look crappy.

890
00:55:35,697 --> 00:55:37,933
- Ron!
- Jesus, I'm right here.

891
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,567
Bobby!

892
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:43,204
- You came to the house.
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.

893
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:45,807
You're looking better.

894
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,377
Anyway, um...
I'll get coffee.

895
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:52,814
That'd be good, thanks.
Thank you.

896
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,361
The janitor thing.

897
00:56:08,497 --> 00:56:11,532
- Is that still an option?
- Yeah. Yes, oh, yeah.

898
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,134
Yes!

899
00:56:33,956 --> 00:56:35,390
Where was this?

900
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,126
I'm pretty sure the original
Michigan Avenue in New York City.

901
00:56:40,162 --> 00:56:41,762
Where do the old
readers meet?

902
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,432
Around the corner,
third door on the left.

903
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,434
- Hey, Tommy.
- See you next week.

904
00:56:46,502 --> 00:56:47,869
All right.
Good luck to you.

905
00:56:47,936 --> 00:56:49,637
Thank you.

906
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:50,938
Well, hi. I'm Mark.

907
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:53,574
Bob.

908
00:56:53,642 --> 00:56:56,544
First time with us,
I think. So how you doing?

909
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:59,547
I'm okay, I guess.

910
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:04,352
- Friend of Bill's.
- Yeah. Bill Wilson.

911
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,121
He's our founder.

912
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,759
I'm sorry.
Just, uh...

913
00:57:11,827 --> 00:57:14,496
I don't have the same
problems as these people.

914
00:57:14,563 --> 00:57:16,398
I have it easy.

915
00:57:16,465 --> 00:57:18,533
It just makes me think
I've been acting like a pussy.

916
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,004
I hear what you're saying, but I think
you're being a little hard on yourself.

917
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:28,076
I'm listening to people with real
problems talk about the disease.

918
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:32,547
If what I have is a disease,
then the cure is character.

919
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:35,116
Character
is important,

920
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:38,453
but the cure
is not drinking.

921
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,721
There are many paths
that lead to that cure.

922
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:42,223
This one's mine.

923
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:47,262
Makes me look at
why I do what I do,

924
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:49,864
but it's not some
requirement for the cure.

925
00:57:49,932 --> 00:57:53,668
- People talk like it is.
- Ah, people like to talk.

926
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:56,271
Only thing you need to listen to
is the one voice, the true voice,

927
00:57:56,338 --> 00:58:00,841
the voice that lets you
know what's right.

928
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:05,680
If that voice brings you back
to us, we're not going anywhere.

929
00:58:05,747 --> 00:58:07,515
Thanks.

930
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:14,322
Jenny, hey!
Haven't see you in a while.

931
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,791
Hey, Bob!
Welcome back.

932
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:18,793
We missed you.

933
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:21,796
Friend of Bill's?

934
00:58:21,863 --> 00:58:23,764
I get it.

935
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:29,170
What the hell was that
supposed to mean?

936
00:58:32,808 --> 00:58:34,476
Sanjay.

937
00:58:34,543 --> 00:58:36,244
Sanjay. Sanjay.

938
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,581
Okay, all right.

939
00:58:39,648 --> 00:58:41,882
I thought
you were dead!

940
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,352
Oh, I'm sorry.

941
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,053
You're sorry
that I'm alive?

942
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,289
No. I didn't mean to say it.

943
00:58:48,357 --> 00:58:51,058
- Oh, that's-- It's okay.
- I'm glad you're alive.

944
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,661
- Okay.
- You're a good boy.

945
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:31,032
Where am I?

946
01:00:42,404 --> 01:00:46,140
Oh, hi. I haven't
seen you in forever.

947
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,609
Hi.

948
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:49,076
You look fantastic.

949
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:51,246
Oh, thank you.

950
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:54,081
Uh, and you
look great, too.

951
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:56,451
Oh, thanks.

952
01:00:56,518 --> 01:00:59,754
- I should go. I'm really late.
- Okay.

953
01:00:59,821 --> 01:01:01,122
- I'm here every night.
- I'll see you again.

954
01:01:01,189 --> 01:01:02,957
- Yeah.
- I'm here every night.

955
01:01:03,024 --> 01:01:04,058
- Night.
- Right.

956
01:01:04,126 --> 01:01:05,126
- Good night.
- Bye.

957
01:01:05,193 --> 01:01:06,827
- Nighty night.
- Yeah.

958
01:01:06,895 --> 01:01:09,297
Jesus Christ.
Nighty night?

959
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,468
Bob! Hey, the place
has never looked better.

960
01:01:13,535 --> 01:01:15,370
Which is a testament
to your skill.

961
01:01:15,437 --> 01:01:17,037
So what do you need,
Sonny?

962
01:01:17,105 --> 01:01:21,376
Well, it's the desk.

963
01:01:21,443 --> 01:01:23,378
You see how I have it
set up here?

964
01:01:23,445 --> 01:01:26,147
I got the coffee mug here,
my pens here,

965
01:01:26,214 --> 01:01:29,216
order forms here,
record book here.

966
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:32,119
Could you make sure
it stays that way?

967
01:01:32,187 --> 01:01:34,088
- All right.
- 'Cause sometimes I come in here

968
01:01:34,156 --> 01:01:37,525
and the pens are over there, and the coffee
cup is where the order forms should go.

969
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:41,496
It's complete chaos, so could
you look out for me, brotha?

970
01:01:42,964 --> 01:01:45,366
You bet.
Good night.

971
01:01:47,803 --> 01:01:50,471
Dude, you are so cold.

972
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:52,573
- What? What'd I do?
- "What? What'd I do?"

973
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,144
This is broken.

974
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:01,015
It's honest work.

975
01:02:01,082 --> 01:02:06,321
And I don't mean like "Brother,
can you spare a dime" honest.

976
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:07,922
It's straightforward.

977
01:02:07,989 --> 01:02:09,724
The fruits of your labors
are right there.

978
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,992
Floors are swept,
carpets vacuumed.

979
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,594
Mm-hmm.

980
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:15,496
I feel custodial,

981
01:02:15,564 --> 01:02:18,966
like I've been given
the custody of something.

982
01:02:19,034 --> 01:02:21,902
I'm the caretaker.

983
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:23,571
- The curate.
- Right.

984
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:27,442
Yes, I'm a janitor,
but it's not like sales.

985
01:02:27,509 --> 01:02:28,776
Right here.

986
01:02:28,844 --> 01:02:32,146
Dragging Mrs. Whozits
around the showroom floor,

987
01:02:32,214 --> 01:02:34,382
trying to get her to buy
the most expensive futon

988
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,418
for Tiffany to take
to Brown in the fall.

989
01:02:37,486 --> 01:02:38,986
That's not honest work.

990
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:42,357
It's getting people to think
that they need things.

991
01:02:42,424 --> 01:02:44,525
It's not custodial.

992
01:02:44,593 --> 01:02:47,161
I think
you're doing great, Bob.

993
01:02:47,229 --> 01:02:49,664
You don't have to yank my chain
here, Ron. I'm just talking.

994
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:51,566
No, no. I--

995
01:02:51,633 --> 01:02:55,102
Cleanest I've ever
seen the place. Truly.

996
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,537
Thanks, Ron.
Thank you.

997
01:02:56,605 --> 01:02:57,905
You're welcome.

998
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,545
You ever think about dad?

999
01:03:04,613 --> 01:03:07,782
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1000
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:12,253
What do you remember?
Anything?

1001
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:16,391
Yeah, I kind of remember
we were going fishing.

1002
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:18,793
I remember being
excited about that.

1003
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,294
The green tent.

1004
01:03:20,362 --> 01:03:23,364
Yeah.

1005
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,666
Why do you ask?

1006
01:03:25,734 --> 01:03:27,468
I don't know.

1007
01:03:27,536 --> 01:03:28,903
What's that?

1008
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:31,105
like no static or something?

1009
01:03:31,172 --> 01:03:32,607
Yeah, exactly.

1010
01:03:32,674 --> 01:03:34,542
That's cool.

1011
01:03:40,148 --> 01:03:42,450
You and Janet ever think
about seeing someone?

1012
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,619
What, like a counselor?

1013
01:03:44,686 --> 01:03:46,086
Um...

1014
01:03:47,088 --> 01:03:49,189
Just think about it.

1015
01:03:49,257 --> 01:03:50,691
It's your life, okay?

1016
01:03:53,128 --> 01:03:55,596
Hey, are you using
your free days?

1017
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:57,665
Like going to museums,
ball games,

1018
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,534
all the stuff
we never get to do here?

1019
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:01,268
Uh, no. Not yet.

1020
01:04:01,336 --> 01:04:04,972
You gotta strike a blow for all
of us chained to a desk all day.

1021
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:10,110
I bet you somebody like Ms. Thorne
would like stuff like that,

1022
01:04:10,178 --> 01:04:12,313
like culture and...

1023
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:15,049
stuff like...
I don't know.

1024
01:04:15,116 --> 01:04:17,217
- Culture.
- Yeah.

1025
01:04:17,285 --> 01:04:19,219
Like that.

1026
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,791
Now, get back to work.

1027
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:25,960
Yes, sir, Mr. Funk.

1028
01:05:26,421 --> 01:05:28,789
That son of a bitch.

1029
01:05:30,425 --> 01:05:32,226
What's up?

1030
01:05:32,293 --> 01:05:35,095
Bob super-glued
everything to the desk.

1031
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,166
That's kinda funny,
though, right?

1032
01:05:39,234 --> 01:05:41,836
- Kinda funny?
- Yeah.

1033
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,838
It's fucking genius.

1034
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:46,874
So I finally get to window,
and I ask the lady for two-cent stamps.

1035
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:48,643
You know,
for the increase.

1036
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:51,612
And she shuffles through
the drawer for a minute,

1037
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,849
and I'm thinking, "What are the chances
she'll find something useful in there

1038
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,751
like, oh, I don't know,
stamps?"

1039
01:05:56,818 --> 01:06:01,388
But no! She turns and ambles on back to
the back room back there-- back there--

1040
01:06:01,456 --> 01:06:03,558
God knows what they do
back there.

1041
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:06,861
The door swings open, and I see some
guy standing back there in a T-shirt

1042
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:10,031
staring off into space with his
lips moving-- lips moving-- lips moving--

1043
01:06:10,098 --> 01:06:12,166
lips moving like
some idiot savant

1044
01:06:12,233 --> 01:06:15,770
composing a sonata for flute and
fucking harpsichord back there.

1045
01:06:15,837 --> 01:06:18,539
And I'm thinking, "This is part of
the federal government, isn't it?"

1046
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:21,442
I mean, we got a line
snaking all through the lobby,

1047
01:06:21,509 --> 01:06:23,277
and they got one woman
working the window.

1048
01:06:23,344 --> 01:06:26,146
One! And she's gone.
She's disappeared. Poof!

1049
01:06:26,214 --> 01:06:31,285
All these people in line, they hate
me because I made the lady go away!

1050
01:06:32,387 --> 01:06:34,956
Are you all right?

1051
01:06:35,023 --> 01:06:38,025
I love you, Dr. Day.
Okay? I said it, and I'm glad I said it.

1052
01:06:38,093 --> 01:06:40,962
- Bob, I...
- I know it's not healthy.

1053
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:43,464
Are you gonna tell me you
haven't heard of one instance

1054
01:06:43,531 --> 01:06:46,166
where a doctor and a patient
fell in love and got--

1055
01:06:46,234 --> 01:06:48,869
And I'm not saying we should get married.
No, I've been down that road.

1056
01:06:48,937 --> 01:06:51,072
Eight years with a woman
named Pestilence.

1057
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:52,974
Fuck marriage.
Just throw it down and fuck it.

1058
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:54,942
I wanted to tell you
how I feel

1059
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:58,779
because that's what I paid
money to come here and do.

1060
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:02,316
I think you're confusing the fact
that I help you to feel better

1061
01:07:02,383 --> 01:07:06,553
with the whole idea of a loving
and healthy and mutual relationship.

1062
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,990
You don't have
to cheapen it.

1063
01:07:09,057 --> 01:07:10,725
Yes, I feel better.

1064
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:13,494
But if that's a crime, then shave
my head and electrocute me.

1065
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:15,362
That's not why
I love you.

1066
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:19,100
Bob, I've grown
quite fond of you.

1067
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:25,572
But you must know that I don't have
feelings of romantic love for you.

1068
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:29,476
Give me a little credit.
I didn't think I would tell you,

1069
01:07:29,544 --> 01:07:33,247
and you were gonna fall
into my arms. "Oh, Bob!"

1070
01:07:33,314 --> 01:07:36,316
You're a sexy, classy lady,
and you act like one.

1071
01:07:36,384 --> 01:07:39,153
I didn't think I would tell you,
and we'd start to date

1072
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:42,857
and spend long evenings
together and go to breakfast.

1073
01:07:42,924 --> 01:07:44,725
There's no hidden agenda
here, Dr. Day.

1074
01:07:44,793 --> 01:07:48,562
I'm not trying to swing
a special rate, you know?

1075
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:53,668
I just wanted to see if
I could still say the words.

1076
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:55,269
That's all.

1077
01:07:58,907 --> 01:08:01,542
Yes, I'm sorry,
we are a little past time.

1078
01:08:05,446 --> 01:08:07,114
Bob.

1079
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:15,389
Don't underestimate your ability to
love someone who can love you back.

1080
01:08:18,026 --> 01:08:19,994
See you next time.

1081
01:08:24,032 --> 01:08:25,265
Culture!

1082
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:27,467
It's a blank canvas.

1083
01:08:27,535 --> 01:08:31,038
How can they call it a painting
if there isn't any paint?

1084
01:08:31,106 --> 01:08:32,673
That's more your speed.

1085
01:08:37,545 --> 01:08:39,980
You want room
for milk?

1086
01:08:40,048 --> 01:08:42,649
Excuse me.
You want room for milk?

1087
01:08:44,152 --> 01:08:47,722
Yes, I would love room for milk.
Thank you for asking.

1088
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:51,291
Seriously, guy,
what's going on?

1089
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:53,961
It's...

1090
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:57,832
just so beautiful.

1091
01:09:20,655 --> 01:09:23,423
Hi.

1092
01:09:24,492 --> 01:09:26,326
- Hi!
- Oh! Jesus Christ!

1093
01:09:26,394 --> 01:09:29,296
Sorry! Sorry.

1094
01:09:29,364 --> 01:09:33,200
- You've got to stop doing that.
- I'm sorry.

1095
01:09:33,268 --> 01:09:34,902
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1096
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:38,839
I'm gonna get you
a collar with a bell.

1097
01:09:38,907 --> 01:09:41,675
A really big bell.

1098
01:09:45,046 --> 01:09:47,447
Um, what have you got there?

1099
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:50,251
I don't, uh--
Huh? Nothing.

1100
01:09:50,318 --> 01:09:51,551
Behind your--

1101
01:09:51,619 --> 01:09:54,354
It was supposed to be
a surprise for the morning.

1102
01:09:54,422 --> 01:09:56,390
Surprise me now.

1103
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:58,859
Uh...

1104
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:03,264
Okay. Close 'em
and put 'em out.

1105
01:10:03,331 --> 01:10:06,600
Out. Put 'em out.
There we go.

1106
01:10:06,668 --> 01:10:09,136
And... ta-da!

1107
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:12,439
It's <i>The Starry Night.</i>

1108
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:14,574
The artist
cut his own ear off.

1109
01:10:14,642 --> 01:10:18,179
- But you probably knew that.
- I did.

1110
01:10:21,683 --> 01:10:23,150
Oh, wow.

1111
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:25,719
I don't think even I could
spill stuff out of this.

1112
01:10:25,787 --> 01:10:30,324
Yeah, that last spill took a full
bottle of that Didi stuff to get out.

1113
01:10:30,391 --> 01:10:32,159
What was that? Ink?

1114
01:10:32,227 --> 01:10:33,194
Motor oil.

1115
01:10:33,261 --> 01:10:37,464
- Sorry.
- Of course.

1116
01:10:37,532 --> 01:10:40,301
Oh, what happened
to your phone?

1117
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:41,735
It broke.

1118
01:10:43,604 --> 01:10:47,107
Never seen a receiver
broken in half like this.

1119
01:10:47,175 --> 01:10:49,210
Did you strike something
with it?

1120
01:10:49,277 --> 01:10:51,745
- I dropped it.
- From where?

1121
01:10:53,248 --> 01:10:55,916
I did a pretty good job taping it,
though, don't you think?

1122
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:57,417
Very nice, yes.

1123
01:10:57,485 --> 01:11:00,020
The edge of the tape kept coming
up and getting stuck in my hair,

1124
01:11:00,088 --> 01:11:02,122
so thank you.

1125
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:04,358
No problem.
You're welcome.

1126
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:12,399
So what brings you here
so late?

1127
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:14,634
I was just
in the neighborhood.

1128
01:11:14,702 --> 01:11:16,503
Huh.

1129
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:24,011
Look, uh,
this is an apology.

1130
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,415
We got off on the wrong foot with
the harassment thing and the 69-J's,

1131
01:11:28,483 --> 01:11:29,850
and I was a jerk.

1132
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:31,818
Yeah.

1133
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,921
No.

1134
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,289
Apology accepted.

1135
01:11:36,758 --> 01:11:39,693
I mean, clearly
you've changed, but...

1136
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:43,463
but the good kinda change.

1137
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,301
Has anybody, you know,
told you?

1138
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:50,304
My shrink, maybe, but...

1139
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,839
you'd be the first
real person.

1140
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:56,610
Thank you, Ms. Thorne.

1141
01:11:56,677 --> 01:11:58,845
You're welcome.

1142
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:01,382
Oh, uh,
I got you a flower.

1143
01:12:03,818 --> 01:12:06,887
I love daisies.
Thank you.

1144
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:10,024
Oh, and... a muffin.

1145
01:12:10,091 --> 01:12:11,191
What kind?

1146
01:12:11,259 --> 01:12:12,326
Cranberry.

1147
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:13,627
Shut up!

1148
01:12:13,694 --> 01:12:15,729
- Cranberry is my favorite.
- Really?

1149
01:12:15,797 --> 01:12:17,697
Yeah! Somebody told you.

1150
01:12:17,765 --> 01:12:20,167
No, no.
I went to the Muffin Hut.

1151
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:24,405
They got like 102 different--
Kinda like, "Cranberry!"

1152
01:12:24,472 --> 01:12:25,973
Is it your favorite,
really?

1153
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:27,841
It is.

1154
01:12:27,909 --> 01:12:30,210
It really, really is.

1155
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:46,560
So, uh, you want
another club soda?

1156
01:12:46,627 --> 01:12:51,932
Yeah, with lots and lots
and lots of lime.

1157
01:13:07,048 --> 01:13:10,384
Fighting
the good fight, huh?

1158
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:14,221
What is that? I don't know what
that means, "the good fight."

1159
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:15,755
Drying out.

1160
01:13:15,823 --> 01:13:18,558
On the wagon.

1161
01:13:24,932 --> 01:13:27,267
Is that clock right?

1162
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:29,603
Yep.

1163
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:31,538
It never seems
late enough to go home.

1164
01:13:31,606 --> 01:13:33,874
And what's late enough?

1165
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:40,680
Time is, what, like a line?

1166
01:13:40,748 --> 01:13:43,217
But there's no room in that.

1167
01:13:43,284 --> 01:13:45,219
If time is a construct,

1168
01:13:45,286 --> 01:13:51,225
then why can't we reconstruct
it from a line to a box?

1169
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:53,327
Like a coffin?

1170
01:13:59,834 --> 01:14:01,235
Hi.

1171
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:11,478
Everything's a riddle to me
these days.

1172
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:13,813
It's paranormal.

1173
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:18,452
I wish I was some kind
of oracle, you know?

1174
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,322
I wish I was the kind of guy
who could figure things out.

1175
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:24,425
Why are you here, Bob?

1176
01:14:24,492 --> 01:14:27,594
To lord your new sobriety
around the room?

1177
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:31,265
Or are you just waiting to fall off
the wagon onto more familiar ground?

1178
01:14:34,202 --> 01:14:36,770
- I'm here to see my friends.
- Yeah?

1179
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:03,997
What's this?

1180
01:15:04,065 --> 01:15:08,868
A G&T from Brewer.

1181
01:15:08,936 --> 01:15:10,204
Your friend.

1182
01:15:11,806 --> 01:15:14,141
Welcome back.

1183
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,876
I'll tell you
why you're here, Bob.

1184
01:15:16,944 --> 01:15:21,948
And if you're wise,
you'll listen.

1185
01:15:22,016 --> 01:15:23,484
Why am I here?

1186
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,856
You're here
to say goodbye.

1187
01:15:49,944 --> 01:15:51,845
Goodbye.

1188
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:05,125
She had very large
gums and very small teeth.

1189
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:09,429
When she smiled,
it was disconcerting,

1190
01:16:09,497 --> 01:16:12,599
like the mouth
of a small child.

1191
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:15,269
It was repulsive to me.

1192
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:20,507
Still, I was married to her
for eight years.

1193
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:22,576
I learned to live with it.

1194
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:25,845
I adapted
to the status quo.

1195
01:16:25,913 --> 01:16:30,317
Now I can't adapt
because there's no constant.

1196
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:34,655
You'd think it'd be easy,
like riding a bike.

1197
01:16:34,722 --> 01:16:38,325
For me, these days,
it's easy like falling down.

1198
01:17:24,939 --> 01:17:26,773
Let me know if you guys
need anything.

1199
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:28,308
- Laura.
- Huh?

1200
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:31,278
Uh, this is my mom.

1201
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:33,480
Oh, wow. Hi.

1202
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:37,150
I've heard...
so much about you.

1203
01:17:37,218 --> 01:17:39,953
Thank you, dear.
Excellent coffee.

1204
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,154
Thank you.

1205
01:17:43,157 --> 01:17:46,393
Okay. Give a shout
if you need me.

1206
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,928
Thanks.

1207
01:17:48,996 --> 01:17:51,398
She's a very
attractive girl.

1208
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,568
I like it here.

1209
01:17:56,437 --> 01:17:58,872
I just need...

1210
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:02,976
Yeah. Just a little
hair of the dog, Robert.

1211
01:18:03,043 --> 01:18:06,179
I've had a long night.

1212
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:10,016
- I know the feeling.
- Hmm.

1213
01:18:10,084 --> 01:18:15,722
Maybe it isn't so difficult
to get a good cup of coffee.

1214
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:17,724
Finding a good man,
though...

1215
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:23,764
Oh, I met an old friend
of yours. I...

1216
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,672
Ah. Derrick Milton.

1217
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:34,574
- Remember him?
- Sure. From college?

1218
01:18:34,642 --> 01:18:38,044
What was he majoring in,
do you remember?

1219
01:18:38,112 --> 01:18:39,979
- Was it date rape?
- Mom!

1220
01:18:40,047 --> 01:18:43,216
Don't be a prude,
Robert.

1221
01:18:46,153 --> 01:18:47,887
What was he like?

1222
01:18:47,955 --> 01:18:49,956
Derrick Milton?

1223
01:18:50,024 --> 01:18:52,292
Mom.

1224
01:18:59,834 --> 01:19:01,702
We lived...

1225
01:19:05,272 --> 01:19:11,578
You father and I lived...
with your grandma and grandpa

1226
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:15,215
when we were
first married.

1227
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:19,619
All the little kids on the whole
block used to come to the house

1228
01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:24,591
to see if Bob could
come out and play.

1229
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,059
Really?

1230
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:32,999
One night I woke up, and he was
having some sort of seizure.

1231
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:37,671
Stiff as a board
and soaked in sweat.

1232
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:41,140
Uh, next day
at the doctor's,

1233
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:44,878
he had another attack
right there in the office.

1234
01:19:44,945 --> 01:19:51,117
They operated and found fluid
on his brain from his sinuses.

1235
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:56,623
He had a final seizure
in the recovery room.

1236
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:58,625
I was holding his hand
at the time.

1237
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:04,898
An orderly came,
and he...

1238
01:20:04,965 --> 01:20:10,504
he had to pry
Bobby's fingers open...

1239
01:20:10,571 --> 01:20:13,874
to free me.

1240
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:19,012
He never woke up.

1241
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:30,023
That was two days before
your fifth Christmas.

1242
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:34,394
They asked me
to donate his eyes.

1243
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:37,497
At first I said no.

1244
01:20:37,565 --> 01:20:43,970
He had such wonderful eyes,
I couldn't bear it.

1245
01:20:44,038 --> 01:20:46,640
But then I approved,

1246
01:20:46,707 --> 01:20:51,611
and they went
to a man from...

1247
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,080
Antelope Valley.

1248
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:59,352
Bob's brown eyes.

1249
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:06,259
That's the first time you
told me what really happened.

1250
01:21:06,327 --> 01:21:08,094
I know.

1251
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:13,700
Why didn't you ever tell me?

1252
01:21:16,904 --> 01:21:19,439
You look so much like him.

1253
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:24,511
Sometimes I see you,
and I think you are him.

1254
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:34,588
You're older now
than he was then.

1255
01:21:34,655 --> 01:21:35,822
You should've told me.

1256
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:38,391
I'm sorry.

1257
01:21:38,459 --> 01:21:43,530
But my whole life,

1258
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:46,099
everything I've built

1259
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:52,071
has been from working so hard
not to think about it.

1260
01:21:53,374 --> 01:21:55,675
I'm sorry.

1261
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:58,344
I can't stop this.

1262
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:02,682
I don't think
you're supposed to.

1263
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:08,788
You're not
supposed to.

1264
01:22:25,339 --> 01:22:27,807
Mama mia.

1265
01:22:42,122 --> 01:22:44,024
- Oh, thanks.
- Hey, Steve. Hey, wait.

1266
01:22:44,091 --> 01:22:45,659
- What?
- How's the play?

1267
01:22:45,726 --> 01:22:48,962
Oh, well, it's scary,
you know.

1268
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:52,732
Opening night's only a few
weeks away. I got a lot of lines.

1269
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,835
But my mother's helping me.
She's holding book.

1270
01:22:55,903 --> 01:22:59,505
That's what we call it when someone
helps you with your lines, "holding book."

1271
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:01,474
- Got all the lingo down, huh?
- A little bit.

1272
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:04,510
Then tell me, why do
they say, "Break a leg"?

1273
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:17,691
Hi.

1274
01:23:17,758 --> 01:23:19,893
You're here late.

1275
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:24,330
It's more of these 69-J's.
It's a historical collection.

1276
01:23:24,398 --> 01:23:26,532
- Yikes.
- Tedious, right?

1277
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,234
Your mom needs them
by tomorrow morning.

1278
01:23:28,302 --> 01:23:31,360
Some guy from the
city's coming to get 'em.

1279
01:23:31,361 --> 01:23:31,638
Okay.

1280
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:34,908
She said to leave them on her desk and
then back them up onto her computer,

1281
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,576
but it's locked.

1282
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:37,978
I'll give them to her.

1283
01:23:38,045 --> 01:23:40,346
Could I back them up
onto Raymundo's computer?

1284
01:23:40,414 --> 01:23:42,849
Sure.

1285
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:44,183
That's okay.
I got it.

1286
01:23:44,251 --> 01:23:45,685
Thank you.

1287
01:23:49,323 --> 01:23:51,825
Hey, are you hungry?

1288
01:23:51,892 --> 01:23:56,830
'Cause there's this excellent Indian place
in the strip mall next to the sushi place.

1289
01:23:56,897 --> 01:23:58,498
We could order in.

1290
01:23:58,565 --> 01:24:01,968
I got this bottle of wine,
and it's breathing.

1291
01:24:02,036 --> 01:24:05,171
That's so sweet of you,
but I already ate, Mr. Funk.

1292
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:08,207
Please. Call me Ron.

1293
01:24:08,275 --> 01:24:10,510
Okay.

1294
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:13,212
Ron.

1295
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,848
Ron.

1296
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:20,020
Tell me, what kind of perfume--
Is it perfume?

1297
01:24:20,087 --> 01:24:22,055
It's white ginger oil,
actually.

1298
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:23,322
It's very
distinctive.

1299
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:24,590
Thank you.

1300
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:28,561
I can tell you where
to get some for your wife.

1301
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:30,797
- You get back to me with that.
- Okay. See you later.

1302
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:33,499
- Good night, Steve.
- Yeah.

1303
01:24:33,567 --> 01:24:35,669
Do you ever think about
what you might be missing in life?

1304
01:24:35,736 --> 01:24:38,371
- Well...
- Like life is flying by,

1305
01:24:38,438 --> 01:24:41,908
and you're just watching,
wishing you can be a part of it,

1306
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:46,046
and feeling...
incapable of joining in?

1307
01:24:46,113 --> 01:24:48,648
I guess I never really
thought about it like that.

1308
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:51,084
I found this hair
growing out of my ear,

1309
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:54,921
and now it's like,
"Am I getting old all of a sudden?"

1310
01:24:56,623 --> 01:24:58,792
There's nothing old
about ear hair.

1311
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:03,629
My wife, she teases me
about it sometimes, you know?

1312
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:06,432
I'm sure she hasn't forgotten
what a great guy she has.

1313
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,001
Oh.

1314
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:09,368
Oh.

1315
01:25:13,207 --> 01:25:16,375
- You're all I think about.
- Okay, Mr. Funk--

1316
01:25:16,443 --> 01:25:18,111
Do you think we have
chemistry, you and me?

1317
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:19,612
As friends,
yes, definitely,

1318
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,215
but I don't think that there's
a romantic thing going on here.

1319
01:25:22,282 --> 01:25:24,050
Because I think I feel enough
for the both of us.

1320
01:25:24,118 --> 01:25:26,953
Oh, great. It's not you, okay?
It's not you, you're great.

1321
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:30,824
Is it Bob? I don't understand it.
He's got nothing going.

1322
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:34,928
- Hi, Mr. Funk.
- Hey, what's-- Bob!

1323
01:25:34,995 --> 01:25:36,029
I, uh...

1324
01:25:45,572 --> 01:25:46,940
I got this memo from Mom.

1325
01:25:47,007 --> 01:25:49,909
She said she wants
to see me in the morning.

1326
01:25:49,977 --> 01:25:51,344
Probably about my old job.

1327
01:25:51,411 --> 01:25:53,412
- That's really super.
- That's great.

1328
01:25:57,752 --> 01:25:58,852
I should go.

1329
01:25:58,919 --> 01:26:01,821
Yeah. Good night.

1330
01:26:04,558 --> 01:26:07,193
- I'm sorry if I kept you.
- That's okay.

1331
01:26:11,398 --> 01:26:15,135
So, how are things down at
the lab, Professor Chemistry?

1332
01:26:15,202 --> 01:26:17,203
"Dear Ron, what the fuck?"

1333
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:20,539
You're like groping all over
an employee like a monkey!

1334
01:26:20,607 --> 01:26:23,042
Oh, and "P.S.,
you're a married monkey."

1335
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:24,778
End of letter.

1336
01:26:24,845 --> 01:26:27,446
I was just
thinking out loud.

1337
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:30,216
What does that even mean?

1338
01:26:30,284 --> 01:26:33,019
It was just a hope
or a dream or--

1339
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:37,223
I didn't think you'd be
playing Secret Agent Man.

1340
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:38,357
Oh, no.

1341
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:40,526
- What?
- Oh, no.

1342
01:26:40,594 --> 01:26:42,028
Oh, no.

1343
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:43,729
What?

1344
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:45,731
I just shredded
all the 69-J's.

1345
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,834
Yeah, well, good riddance.
I hate those fucking things.

1346
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:48,902
You idiot!

1347
01:26:48,969 --> 01:26:50,937
Don't you see
how huge this is?

1348
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:54,974
Ms. Thorne compiled these for Mom for
tomorrow, and I just shredded them.

1349
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:56,976
Don't you see?

1350
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:04,383
Damn it!

1351
01:27:04,451 --> 01:27:06,820
Damn it!

1352
01:27:06,887 --> 01:27:09,155
How can you
just stand there, huh?

1353
01:27:09,223 --> 01:27:13,526
If you know how huge this is,
why are you just standing there?

1354
01:27:13,593 --> 01:27:17,330
Because I'm the idiot
who didn't shred the forms.

1355
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:22,068
Mom is gonna completely
kill me, okay?

1356
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:24,237
Don't be so afraid
of her, Ron.

1357
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:28,107
I'm past 30, Bob.

1358
01:27:28,175 --> 01:27:31,110
It's too late for me
to stop being afraid of Mom.

1359
01:27:31,178 --> 01:27:35,248
I'm gonna die afraid of Mom.
Aren't you afraid of Mom?

1360
01:27:36,483 --> 01:27:37,884
I guess I'm not.

1361
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:40,954
Well, that's just stupid.

1362
01:27:46,393 --> 01:27:47,961
Breathe.

1363
01:27:48,028 --> 01:27:49,795
Breathe.

1364
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,168
Go home.

1365
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:56,202
Bob...

1366
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:58,838
Go home to your wife.

1367
01:29:28,628 --> 01:29:30,529
I'll tell you what it is.

1368
01:29:30,597 --> 01:29:35,501
I'm a carpenter, and I wanna
build something out of wood.

1369
01:29:35,569 --> 01:29:39,238
Which makes sense,
my being a carpenter and all.

1370
01:29:40,474 --> 01:29:44,410
Anyway, I'm making
this thing out of wood.

1371
01:29:44,478 --> 01:29:46,112
I have some pretty good
wood to work with,

1372
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,781
and I know how I want the
thing to look when it's done.

1373
01:29:48,849 --> 01:29:51,250
I have basic tools:
the hammer, the nails,

1374
01:29:51,318 --> 01:29:53,119
the yadda yadda yadda
and the blah blah blah.

1375
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:56,456
And I want to miter the
corners of my new wooden thing,

1376
01:29:56,523 --> 01:29:59,192
but I don't have
a "miter-er".

1377
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:01,794
That was a lousy analogy.

1378
01:30:01,862 --> 01:30:03,729
You're on
the brink of something.

1379
01:30:03,797 --> 01:30:05,631
Yeah, exactly.

1380
01:30:05,699 --> 01:30:10,903
Something. I just--
But I don't know what.

1381
01:30:10,971 --> 01:30:13,873
I feel...

1382
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:14,974
good?

1383
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:18,478
Did you ever
ask that woman out?

1384
01:30:18,545 --> 01:30:22,848
Yeah, well, I didn't say
I wasn't still a coward.

1385
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:24,517
It's not cowardice.

1386
01:30:24,584 --> 01:30:29,822
In fact,
it's kind of endearing.

1387
01:30:31,091 --> 01:30:32,858
Don't say that.

1388
01:30:32,926 --> 01:30:36,595
I might think you're
starting to like me.

1389
01:30:36,663 --> 01:30:38,564
Uh, you know what?

1390
01:30:38,632 --> 01:30:41,700
I'm sorry, but I'm actually gonna
have to cut out of here a little early.

1391
01:30:41,768 --> 01:30:44,370
I'm meeting my sponsor
for a drink.

1392
01:30:46,173 --> 01:30:48,908
Right. Okay, well...

1393
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:53,546
Will you marry me?
I mean I'll see you next week.

1394
01:30:55,382 --> 01:30:56,649
That's all it took?

1395
01:30:58,785 --> 01:31:00,786
See you next time.

1396
01:31:00,854 --> 01:31:03,222
I've said
much funnier things.

1397
01:31:04,791 --> 01:31:06,592
Much funnier things.

1398
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:10,596
As far as I'm concerned,
it never happened, okay?

1399
01:31:10,664 --> 01:31:13,499
Tell him
not to worry about it.

1400
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:16,169
It's embarrassing
because the truth is...

1401
01:31:16,236 --> 01:31:18,604
I'm the one who knocked
everything off balance here.

1402
01:31:18,672 --> 01:31:22,775
The truth is the only thing that
you never have to be ashamed of.

1403
01:31:22,842 --> 01:31:24,510
Ugly or not.

1404
01:31:24,578 --> 01:31:28,314
Everything that
I stain, break or ruin,

1405
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:31,050
that's embarrassing to me.

1406
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:33,652
But that's who I am.

1407
01:31:34,988 --> 01:31:36,989
It's part of your charm.

1408
01:31:39,259 --> 01:31:40,326
Thank you.

1409
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:43,829
But what I'm
trying to say is

1410
01:31:43,897 --> 01:31:46,499
don't be afraid
to be yourself.

1411
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:49,068
It's all you've got.

1412
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:53,206
I sound like one of those crappy
self-help books I read in my twenties.

1413
01:31:53,273 --> 01:31:55,674
What? Are you past 30?

1414
01:31:57,077 --> 01:32:00,246
Not as far as you know.

1415
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:03,983
So why don't you just
tell him to leave?

1416
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:07,420
So maybe you should tell him again.
Hold one one second.

1417
01:32:07,488 --> 01:32:09,255
Bob, I don't think he
wants anyone disturbing him.

1418
01:32:09,256 --> 01:32:10,156
It's okay. I'm his brother.

1419
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:14,193
Hey, open up, nimrod!

1420
01:32:14,261 --> 01:32:16,962
- Yes, Ron?
- Hey, tell nimrod to open the door.

1421
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:18,063
Yes, Ron.

1422
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:22,001
Um, he said, um...
go away.

1423
01:32:22,068 --> 01:32:24,504
- You're quoting him?
- Verbatim.

1424
01:32:24,571 --> 01:32:27,440
That means "word for word."

1425
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:30,343
Fancy. Okay, I'll leave,
but not till after I tell you

1426
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:33,012
about the time that Ron and I
went to our friend Andy's house

1427
01:32:33,079 --> 01:32:34,847
and we were looking
at <i>Playboys,</i>

1428
01:32:34,914 --> 01:32:37,150
and Ron got
so worked up that--

1429
01:32:38,818 --> 01:32:39,818
What?

1430
01:32:39,886 --> 01:32:41,787
It's a charming story.

1431
01:32:41,855 --> 01:32:44,657
I don't think my secretary needs
to know about me wetting my pants.

1432
01:32:44,724 --> 01:32:47,160
- You were nine years old.
- I told Janet, okay?

1433
01:32:47,227 --> 01:32:51,063
I told her the whole thing, okay?
You happy?

1434
01:32:51,131 --> 01:32:53,766
- About the <i>Playboys?</i>
- About Ms. Thorne.

1435
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,135
And you're mad at me?

1436
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:58,771
I'm sorry I caught you.
Should I say that?

1437
01:32:58,838 --> 01:33:04,610
No. But we're gonna start
looking for somebody to...

1438
01:33:04,678 --> 01:33:06,546
you know, see.

1439
01:33:06,613 --> 01:33:09,382
- Like a marriage counselor?
- Bob, could you keep it down?

1440
01:33:09,449 --> 01:33:13,219
Jesus, God, Christ!
Yes!

1441
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:20,859
Now I gotta go tell Mom
that I screwed the pooch.

1442
01:33:20,927 --> 01:33:22,961
- You did what?
- Quit kidding around.

1443
01:33:23,029 --> 01:33:27,900
It isn't just a job to me.
I happen to like it here. I'm sorry.

1444
01:33:30,837 --> 01:33:33,105
It's not your fault.

1445
01:33:33,173 --> 01:33:36,175
I was the closest thing you had
to a male role model.

1446
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:37,876
You think
I'm ashamed of you?

1447
01:33:37,944 --> 01:33:41,914
I've never felt
that way, not once.

1448
01:33:43,049 --> 01:33:45,484
I didn't mean
what I said last night.

1449
01:33:45,552 --> 01:33:47,553
I was out of my mind.

1450
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,668
What do you think
Mom's gonna do?

1451
01:34:02,736 --> 01:34:06,606
She's probably gonna transfer
me to one of the outer stores.

1452
01:34:06,673 --> 01:34:10,576
Worse case, the warehouse
in Panorama City.

1453
01:34:10,644 --> 01:34:12,010
Ouch.

1454
01:34:15,782 --> 01:34:20,853
Hey, you wouldn't have told that story
really about being at Andy's, would you?

1455
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,455
- Yes.
- No way.

1456
01:34:22,522 --> 01:34:24,823
Life is hard, my friend.

1457
01:34:32,832 --> 01:34:37,803
Good morning.
I'll be with you in just a minute.

1458
01:34:39,306 --> 01:34:42,475
I don't have
a lot of time, boys.

1459
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:49,749
So, Robert, I would like to re-offer you
the position of vice president of sales.

1460
01:34:49,816 --> 01:34:51,950
And I'm happy
to have you back.

1461
01:34:52,018 --> 01:34:54,287
Me, too.
That's freaking awesome!

1462
01:34:54,354 --> 01:34:58,056
Ms. Thorne tells me that
she left the 69-J's with you.

1463
01:34:58,124 --> 01:35:01,927
Yeah, well,
about that...

1464
01:35:01,995 --> 01:35:03,529
- I shredded them.
- I shredded them.

1465
01:35:03,597 --> 01:35:04,830
What?

1466
01:35:04,898 --> 01:35:08,834
I was helping Ronnie out
at the shredder last night,

1467
01:35:08,902 --> 01:35:10,369
and I...

1468
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:17,910
- You shredded them?
- Yeah.

1469
01:35:17,977 --> 01:35:19,211
- Bob...
- But the disk--

1470
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:20,913
Uh, yeah,
shredded that, too.

1471
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:24,750
But she backed it up
on Raymundo's computer.

1472
01:35:24,818 --> 01:35:26,084
I had to replace
the computer

1473
01:35:26,152 --> 01:35:29,388
because I guess
I spilled some wine on it.

1474
01:35:29,456 --> 01:35:31,223
- You're drinking again?
- No!

1475
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:34,593
No! The wine was mine!
Don't listen to him, Mom. I did it.

1476
01:35:34,661 --> 01:35:36,395
Thanks, Ronnie,
but no thanks.

1477
01:35:36,463 --> 01:35:43,869
Did you or did you not destroy
all traces of the form 69-J's?

1478
01:35:43,937 --> 01:35:46,138
I completely--
I vigorously did.

1479
01:35:46,206 --> 01:35:47,127
Mom, It's not true.

1480
01:35:47,128 --> 01:35:49,308
I will give you such a smack,
I swear to God.

1481
01:35:49,376 --> 01:35:54,847
Ronnie, how long at the outside
to compile a new historical set?

1482
01:35:54,914 --> 01:35:57,783
If Ms. Thorne has the worksheets,
four days, three if I hustle.

1483
01:35:57,851 --> 01:35:59,352
Hustle.

1484
01:35:59,419 --> 01:36:01,587
- I'll clean out my locker.
- Mom, don't.

1485
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:04,122
- Calm down.
- No! I don't want to calm down!

1486
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:05,691
Enough.

1487
01:36:05,759 --> 01:36:08,494
My offer still stands.

1488
01:36:08,562 --> 01:36:10,429
You're not firing me?

1489
01:36:10,497 --> 01:36:11,464
I'm not firing you.

1490
01:36:11,531 --> 01:36:12,598
You're not firing him?

1491
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:16,168
My God! I'm an island
in Crazy River!

1492
01:36:16,236 --> 01:36:18,303
No, I'm not firing him.

1493
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:23,242
You mean, I actually worked
for something, and I got it.

1494
01:36:24,711 --> 01:36:25,878
Weird.

1495
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:28,647
I quit.

1496
01:36:35,021 --> 01:36:36,321
Say again?

1497
01:36:37,657 --> 01:36:39,291
I quit.

1498
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:41,627
Is this a joke, Robert?

1499
01:36:43,062 --> 01:36:46,098
It's "Bob," okay?

1500
01:36:46,165 --> 01:36:48,434
I'm my father's son.

1501
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:51,704
But, uh... Sunday, Mom,
for dinner, right?

1502
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:54,607
Ron, you tell Janet
I'll actually show up.

1503
01:36:58,612 --> 01:37:01,380
I quit! I quit!

1504
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:03,015
Hi, Bob--
Ooh.

1505
01:37:07,387 --> 01:37:09,288
Bob, Bob,
she's at class.

1506
01:37:09,355 --> 01:37:11,824
Oh. Hey, Steve, I quit!

1507
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:13,826
Okay. You still gonna
come see my play?

1508
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,694
- Wouldn't miss it!
- Yes!

1509
01:37:18,565 --> 01:37:24,236
I'm afraid there will be a
slight delay with the Form 69-J's.

1510
01:37:25,505 --> 01:37:27,640
Hello, Violet.

1511
01:37:28,742 --> 01:37:31,076
Been a long time.

1512
01:37:31,144 --> 01:37:34,179
Gerald Mann.

1513
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,051
How are you?

1514
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:44,156
Now, remember, this is a
cotton mattress, not a futon.

1515
01:37:44,223 --> 01:37:45,257
How's that feel, huh?

1516
01:37:45,325 --> 01:37:46,592
I quit!

1517
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:49,562
- Oh, good luck, Bob!
- Go get 'em, killer!

1518
01:37:49,629 --> 01:37:51,530
I quit!

1519
01:37:51,598 --> 01:37:53,566
I like him better as a rummy.

1520
01:37:53,633 --> 01:37:56,335
I quit!

1521
01:38:49,355 --> 01:38:50,823
Oh, Mr. Funk, hi.

1522
01:38:50,891 --> 01:38:54,092
Unbelievable. I was just
thinking about you.

1523
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:56,629
Please sit.

1524
01:38:56,696 --> 01:38:58,998
Uh, thanks.

1525
01:39:03,236 --> 01:39:06,338
Huh. Oh, uh...
It's Bob, by the way.

1526
01:39:06,406 --> 01:39:09,074
Oh, I know.
My name's Sylvia.

1527
01:39:09,142 --> 01:39:11,810
Oh, I know.
It's a lovely name.

1528
01:39:11,878 --> 01:39:12,978
Thank you.

1529
01:39:13,046 --> 01:39:15,681
My mom wanted
to call me "Rose,"

1530
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:18,984
but my Dad didn't want me
to be called "Rose Thorne,"

1531
01:39:19,052 --> 01:39:21,787
so they named me Sylvia,
which means "woods."

1532
01:39:21,855 --> 01:39:23,388
Oh.

1533
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:28,861
The usual for Bob.

1534
01:39:28,929 --> 01:39:30,963
Anything else for you?

1535
01:39:31,031 --> 01:39:32,698
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

1536
01:39:32,766 --> 01:39:34,433
Anything at all?

1537
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,501
No, I'm good.

1538
01:39:37,571 --> 01:39:38,637
She's nice.

1539
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:41,306
Mm.

1540
01:39:43,176 --> 01:39:46,278
Thank you.

1541
01:39:46,345 --> 01:39:48,013
I come here all the time.

1542
01:39:48,081 --> 01:39:49,682
I know.

1543
01:39:49,749 --> 01:39:53,819
Your mom told me.
You just quit all of a sudden,

1544
01:39:53,887 --> 01:39:57,189
and I didn't know if I would have
a chance to say goodbye or whatever.

1545
01:39:57,256 --> 01:40:01,994
I was gonna call you, but I didn't
want you to think I was a stalker.

1546
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:04,830
- I wouldn't have thought that.
- You wouldn't?

1547
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:09,401
- Maybe I should call you sometime.
- Maybe you should.

1548
01:40:09,469 --> 01:40:11,169
Maybe I'll do that.

1549
01:40:11,237 --> 01:40:14,306
Or maybe you could just...

1550
01:40:14,373 --> 01:40:17,175
take what it is that you were
gonna say to me on the phone

1551
01:40:17,243 --> 01:40:20,178
and tell it to me
in person, maybe.

1552
01:40:20,246 --> 01:40:23,782
Like if I were to ask you if you
wanted to come see Steve's play with me.

1553
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:26,551
Yeah, uh, or whatever.

1554
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:29,755
Sylvia, would you like
to come see Steve's play--

1555
01:40:29,823 --> 01:40:32,324
Yes, I would.

1556
01:40:42,335 --> 01:40:44,169
This is one of those
dangerous wishes.

1557
01:40:44,237 --> 01:40:45,638
- It is not.
- It is.

1558
01:40:45,705 --> 01:40:47,405
And do you wanna hear
something weird?

1559
01:40:47,473 --> 01:40:49,441
I had a dream about you
last night.

1560
01:40:49,509 --> 01:40:51,543
Really?
Well, tell me.

1561
01:40:51,611 --> 01:40:53,712
Unless it's gross
or something.

1562
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:57,016
Oh, no, not at all.

1563
01:40:57,083 --> 01:41:00,218
Well, we lived
in a campground,

1564
01:41:00,286 --> 01:41:03,355
which, you know,
I don't know what that means.

1565
01:41:03,422 --> 01:41:06,759
I was walking you back
to your campsite one evening,

1566
01:41:06,826 --> 01:41:10,362
and I wanted to hold your hand,
I wanted to hold it so badly,

1567
01:41:10,429 --> 01:41:13,532
and you knew that I wanted
to hold your hand.

1568
01:41:13,599 --> 01:41:17,502
And you said,
"Why don't you hold my hand?"

1569
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:18,737
And I said--

1570
01:41:18,805 --> 01:41:20,605
and I swear I said this
in a dream--

1571
01:41:20,674 --> 01:41:25,177
I said that I was afraid
that touching you

1572
01:41:25,244 --> 01:41:29,114
would start my fall
into oblivion.

1573
01:41:29,182 --> 01:41:35,120
And then you reached out,
you took my hand and you said,

1574
01:41:35,188 --> 01:41:36,755
"Let's go."

1575
01:41:43,196 --> 01:41:44,963
I talk too much.

1576
01:41:45,031 --> 01:41:46,298
No, you don't.

1577
01:41:46,365 --> 01:41:48,100
Yeah. I'm pushing.
I'm a pusher.

1578
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:51,303
I should be hanging around schoolyards,
trying to get the kids hooked on the horse.

1579
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:53,005
No.

1580
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:55,540
That's not it.

1581
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:59,778
I would like for you
to hold my hand...

1582
01:42:02,281 --> 01:42:04,416
but they're glued
to my purse.

1583
01:42:04,483 --> 01:42:07,119
<i># One look #</i>

1584
01:42:09,388 --> 01:42:11,690
<i># One stare #</i>

1585
01:42:13,526 --> 01:42:15,194
<i># You had me #</i>

1586
01:42:15,261 --> 01:42:17,596
<i># Oh #</i>

1587
01:42:17,663 --> 01:42:20,032
<i># You had me #</i>

1588
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:23,468
<i># Oh #</i>

1589
01:42:23,536 --> 01:42:25,370
<i># Don't change #</i>

1590
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:30,508
<i># The way you look at me #</i>

1591
01:42:32,879 --> 01:42:34,913
<i># Don't change #</i>

1592
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:40,085
<i># The way you smile #</i>

1593
01:42:42,455 --> 01:42:47,159
<i># Don't change the way</i>
<i>you speak to me #</i>

1594
01:42:47,227 --> 01:42:51,263
<i># Don't change </i>
<i>what I feel inside #</i>

1595
01:43:48,654 --> 01:43:52,858
And yet would my life
be a tale...

1596
01:43:52,926 --> 01:43:55,160
worth the telling?

1597
01:43:55,228 --> 01:43:56,228
Yes.

1598
01:43:56,296 --> 01:43:58,396
A privy, yes.

1599
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:00,199
No!

1600
01:44:00,266 --> 01:44:03,768
You are, as you know,
my brother.

1601
01:44:03,837 --> 01:44:08,340
And yon woman known
to us both, our mother,

1602
01:44:08,407 --> 01:44:10,742
bid you
come hither!

1603
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:12,845
Sing, madrigal!

1604
01:44:12,912 --> 01:44:14,112
Sing!

1605
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:17,182
Oh, madrigal!

1606
01:44:31,364 --> 01:44:34,099
There is no joy
in this.

1607
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:37,836
We are all
but shadows.

1608
01:44:37,904 --> 01:44:40,672
To the feast!

1609
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:42,341
Take him!

1610
01:44:44,443 --> 01:44:46,311
Take him now!

1611
01:44:47,813 --> 01:44:48,914
Finish it!

1612
01:44:58,992 --> 01:45:00,025
Oh!

1613
01:45:03,662 --> 01:45:09,534
This is the moment
of my death.

1614
01:45:25,451 --> 01:45:27,953
Bravo! Bravo!

1615
01:45:29,889 --> 01:45:30,923
Steve!

1616
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:33,725
Ah, yeah. Thanks.

1617
01:45:33,793 --> 01:45:36,028
Very beautiful!
Very sweet!

1618
01:45:36,095 --> 01:45:38,230
Have you met
my mom?

1619
01:45:38,298 --> 01:45:40,565
That's okay. Mom, I wanna
show you to somebody else.

1620
01:45:40,633 --> 01:45:42,634
This is Ruthie
over here.

1621
01:45:42,701 --> 01:45:43,969
- Hi.
- Hi.

1622
01:45:44,037 --> 01:45:46,471
You did great. Oh!

1623
01:45:46,539 --> 01:45:49,207
Over here is
the hand, Steve.

1624
01:45:49,275 --> 01:45:51,910
Wow! That was a play,
and you were in it!

1625
01:45:51,978 --> 01:45:53,345
I was--

1626
01:45:53,413 --> 01:45:55,213
It was kind of a first-time
thing, but you know.

1627
01:45:55,281 --> 01:45:57,082
It's great.
You were great.

1628
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:58,917
- A powerhouse.
- Really? You thought so?

1629
01:45:58,985 --> 01:46:01,586
Oh, thanks so much
for coming.

1630
01:46:01,654 --> 01:46:03,588
Listen, I gotta tell you something.

1631
01:46:03,656 --> 01:46:07,359
I thought that you
were gonna suck.

1632
01:46:07,427 --> 01:46:09,527
And, no, you were
phenomenal.

1633
01:46:09,595 --> 01:46:12,564
You were so good.
I feel so bad I even had those thoughts.

1634
01:46:12,631 --> 01:46:15,700
You made me cry.

1635
01:46:15,768 --> 01:46:17,436
I can't believe
everybody came!

1636
01:46:17,503 --> 01:46:19,904
- Steven.
- Oh, my goodness!

1637
01:46:19,973 --> 01:46:21,806
Mmm!

1638
01:46:21,874 --> 01:46:23,641
How'd you learn
all those lines?

1639
01:46:23,709 --> 01:46:26,511
I don't know.
My mom helped me with most of 'em.

1640
01:46:26,579 --> 01:46:28,180
Steve,
it was wonderful.

1641
01:46:28,247 --> 01:46:30,415
You were so...
there.

1642
01:46:30,483 --> 01:46:32,017
Thank you so much.

1643
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:34,319
- Congratulations.
- I don't know who you are.

1644
01:46:34,387 --> 01:46:37,122
- Hey! How are ya?
- Hi!

1645
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:39,791
You were amazing.
You were amazing.

1646
01:46:39,859 --> 01:46:42,961
You should be in the movies.
I mean it.

1647
01:46:43,029 --> 01:46:44,729
With this hair,
I don't think so.

1648
01:46:44,797 --> 01:46:46,564
No! You look great
blond.

1649
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:49,834
The other actors,
they were great.

1650
01:46:49,902 --> 01:46:52,170
But you?
You, my friend...

1651
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:55,940
you are why people
go to the theater.

1652
01:46:59,412 --> 01:47:00,612
Thanks.

1653
