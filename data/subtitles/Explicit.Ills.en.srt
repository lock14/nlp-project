(horn honking)

4
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:10,888
(boy) I got you, boy!

5
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:12,896
(boy) Ahh! Ahh?

6
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:14,659
Man, you ain't got shit!

7
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:15,722

8
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:18,429
Ahh, ahh! Fine, fine, mercy!

9
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:19,970
Told you I had you, nigga.

10
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:21,903
Whatever, I'm going home.

11
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:28,337
(baby crying)

12
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,320
(dog barking)

13
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:26,336
May I please get a purple juice?

14
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:29,801
Thank you.

15
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:33,601
(siren blaring)

16
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:35,339
Hey, Babo, do you like my hair?

17
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:40,814
It looks like a poodle.

18
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:42,444
Does my hair look like a poodle?

19
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:52,056
# Yeah #

20
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,361
# All right #

21
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:02,835
# Yeah #

22
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:08,107
# Yeah #

23
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:20,689
# I see you working my melody #

24
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,421
# The way it should be, yeah #

25
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,690
# How they make it look #

26
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,732
# On TV #

27
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:31,257
# I see you working my melody #

28
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:34,032
# The way it should be, yeah #

29
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:36,300
# How they make it look #

30
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,365
# On TV #

31
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:39,842
# Yeah #

32
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:44,780
# Yeah #

33
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:50,015
# Yeah #

34
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,021
# Yeah #

35
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,811
# I see you working my melody #

36
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,541

37
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:18,776
# How they make it look #

38
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,545
# On TV #

39
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,553
# Yeah #

40
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,281
# The way should be, yeah ##

41
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:31,718
(boy) So Peanut Chews
ain't got milk in 'em?

42
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:34,663
(boy) Nah, they're nondairy.

43
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,133
What other vegan shit you be eating?

44
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,567
Everything you eat, man.

45
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:40,628
Man, I don't know, I
had some soy cheese once

46
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:43,333
and it was nasty.

47
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,103
You gotta get the right brand.

48
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:47,337
What brand? Tofutti.

49
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:49,073
Tofutti?

50
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:50,876
Okay.

51
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,314
So you've noticed
that your body's gotten

52
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:53,351
more ripped, right?

53
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,215
Yeah, you can see it more.

54
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,448
Meat stays in your body a long time.

55
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,820
It takes like, um...

56
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:02,655
it takes about, uh,
three days to digest.

57
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,820
Really? Yeah, for sure.

58
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:05,954
Damn.

59
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,767
(panting)

60
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,340
(inhaling)

61
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,696
(cell phone vibrating)

62
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:51,038
Hello.

63
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,633
(boy) Hey, it's Jay, I'm out front.

64
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,076
Okay, I'll be right out.

65
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,722
Hi, I'm Sarah.

66
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,091
Hi.

67
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:12,823
And you remember Jen, right?

68
00:07:12,897 --> 00:07:14,091
Hi.

69
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:15,393
Hi.

70
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,901
All right, so I got three kinds.

71
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:21,370
Um, this is blueberry, AK,

72
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,202
and I've got quarters and mids for 75.

73
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:25,105
This is blueberry? Mm-hmm.

74
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:26,643
Can I open it?

75
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:31,979
They're 50, right? Yep.

76
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,574
So what do you wanna get?

77
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:35,118
I don't care, you can just pick.

78
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,414
Well, we're getting two, right?

79
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:37,648
Yeah, I'm gonna give you ten,

80
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:39,417
'cause I just wanna
smoke a bowl before work.

81
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,322
Okay, so one of each?

82
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:42,792
Okay.

83
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:45,719
So one blueberry and one AK.

84
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:46,593
You wanna pick them out?

85
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:47,961
No, I better not.

86
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:52,527
Um, I'd say these are
gonna be really good.

87
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:54,572
Thank you.

88
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:58,203
You guys mind if I use your bathroom?

89
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:00,540
Oh, no, it's up the stairs to the right.

90
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:02,136
Thanks.

91
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:10,786
Voila.

92
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:18,851
(bong bubbling)

93
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:29,031
(coughing)

94
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:32,474
That smells nice.

95
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:33,806
Is that the blueberry?

96
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:35,607
No, it's the AK.

97
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,704
You want a hit?

98
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:38,112
Ah, no thanks.

99
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:46,454
(Sarah) Oh, my God, that got me so high.

100
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:48,458
I'm so high right now.

101
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:50,255
I have to work in like 15 minutes.

102
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:51,352
Where do you work?

103
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:53,397
15th and Arch, it's a law firm.

104
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,066
And I have to be there in 15 minutes,

105
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,727
and I'm so high.

106
00:08:58,803 --> 00:08:59,667
Fuck.

107
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:01,568
Okay, water.

108
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:09,445
(woman) This is really good pot.

109
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,414
Yes, it is.

110
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:14,915
So, okay, I'm out of here.

111
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:18,012
Um... I'll call you.

112
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,579
And depending on what time,

113
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:21,488
I guess we'll either
get something to eat

114
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,857
or just I'll meet you at the party.

115
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:26,192
(woman) Okay, bye.

116
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:27,424
Oh, bye.

117
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:29,490
Bye. Bye.

118
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,228
So it's my friend's birthday

119
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:33,964
and she's having this huge house party.

120
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:36,836
You should totally come.

121
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:38,569
Cool, okay.

122
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:39,871
Okay.

123
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,778
(rock music blaring)

124
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:24,321
Hey.

125
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:25,856
Hey.

126
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:28,950
I love your beard.

127
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,392
Happy birthday.

128
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:32,929
(rock music blaring)

129
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,112
Hey.

130
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:07,057
(man) Don't fall in love.

131
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:09,065
Love is not really love.

132
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,727
It's just wanting pussy.

133
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:14,966
Don't stay with just one girl
for too long, you'll go stale.

134
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,131
Live a big life.

135
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:18,334
Make that money.

136
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:21,105
You fuck as many girls as you can, okay?

137
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:26,573
Can we get some more ice?

138
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,482
Yeah, get me a lemon.

139
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:36,022
Let me get a lemon and blue raspberry.

140
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,442
You wanna kiss me tomorrow?

141
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:02,651
What?

142
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,688
I said, "Do you wanna kiss me tomorrow?"

143
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:10,960
(clearing throat)

144
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,496
It's $3.

145
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:18,792
Let me get a five?

146
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,314
I'll get your soda.

147
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,443
I'll get her soda.

148
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,817
Okay, $4.

149
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:38,150
You like fish?

150
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:39,849
Yeah.

151
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:41,289
20 fish.

152
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,428
$5.

153
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:55,801
It's all you.

154
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,404
(bells jingling)

155
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:07,809
So many people have died.

156
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:09,716
It's fucked up.

157
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:13,086
And young kids too,
you know what I mean?

158
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:14,556
Yeah.

159
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:22,666
You know, my boy is out there.

160
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,292
He's a sergeant.

161
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:30,473
You gotta train through
all that chemical stuff.

162
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,974
You still talk to him?

163
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:35,605
No.

164
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:42,910
You look so hot right now.

165
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,614
Shut up.

166
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:48,388
(laughing)

167
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:53,357
Are you hungry?

168
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:54,693
A little bit.

169
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:58,535
Okay, I'll be right back.

170
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:15,117
I love these.

171
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:18,082
They're organic.

172
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:19,384
No, thanks.

173
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,270
That's a nice painting.

174
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,637
Thanks.

175
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,767
Did you paint it? Mm-hmm.

176
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,350
Do you know...

177
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,412
"Going on A Treasure Hunt"?

178
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,515
Yeah.

179
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,719
My mom used to do that
to me when I was little.

180
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:00,994
Do it to me.

181
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,200
Sure.

182
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:13,871
# Going on a treasure hunt #

183
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,937
# "X" marks the spot #

184
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:21,678
# Dash, dash, dash #

185
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:24,016
# And a dot, dot, dot... ##

186
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:47,643
(truck beeping)

187
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,940
Man, I don't think I'm
ever gonna get to 150.

188
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:54,109
30 pounds was pretty ambitious.

189
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:56,551
I know.

190
00:15:56,621 --> 00:16:00,022
I wanna go away for like a month.

191
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:01,615
I know what you mean.

192
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,557
Like Costa Rica,

193
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:06,461
go to the top of the
volcano and shit like that.

194
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:08,260
Yeah.

195
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,199
When I get my biceps
a little bit bigger,

196
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:13,931
I'll finally be able to relax.

197
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,233
I just wanna relax, man.

198
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:17,035
I feel too much pressure.

199
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:18,370
Pressure to what?

200
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:20,205
Gotta hold shit down.

201
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:22,838
My dad wants me to work in his store.

202
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:25,246
If he can open one.

203
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:27,250
That could be cool.

204
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:29,513
I know, but I don't wanna work.

205
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:30,781
I want to go to New Zealand

206
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,880
for the World's Strong Man competition

207
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:34,948
and win that whole shit.

208
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,254
You could do it.

209
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:37,726
And I could be your trainer.

210
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:39,262
Yeah.

211
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,312
(boy) What size you wear?

212
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:00,543
(Babo) Huh?

213
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:02,449
You heard me.

214
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,147
What size do you wear?

215
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,587
Four.

216
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,284
Four?

217
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,656
You a little girl?

218
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:10,853
No.

219
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:13,360
Wrong answer.

220
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:36,076
What's up?

221
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:37,677
Sorry I'm late.

222
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:41,655
How much candy did
you have to eat today?

223
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,193
None.

224
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,522
No. None?

225
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:45,789
All I had was one soda.

226
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:48,331
Look, I don't care if
you had one soda, man,

227
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:50,458
just stop acting like
you don't know what's up.

228
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:51,967
Sorry.

229
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,027
Look, man, I know you think
I'm going to hard on you,

230
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:56,232
but if you wanna make
it like you tell me,

231
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:57,797
it takes discipline, man.

232
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,103
All the time.

233
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:00,939
Not some of the time, Heslin.

234
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:03,879
And what did we say that discipline
starts with your what? My body.

235
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:06,416
That's right, your body.

236
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:08,679
Wash some of those greens off, man.

237
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:09,742
Make yourself a smoothie.

238
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,185
'Cause if you learned anything,

239
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:14,281
you know your body's mad
acidic right now from that soda.

240
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:16,519
Okay.

241
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,653
I'm sorry.

242
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:20,526
Quit with that sorry shit, too, man.

243
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,532
Just get on your game.

244
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,965
All right.

245
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:30,468
Where's the greens?

246
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,236
Bottom right.

247
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,540
I don't see 'em.

248
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:49,124
Hey, sweetie.

249
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:50,558
Hey, Mom.

250
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:53,461
Hey, babe, you... have
you seen the greens?

251
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:55,795
Yeah, I ate them.

252
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:57,265
Great.

253
00:18:57,334 --> 00:18:59,700
I made a salad when you
were in the basement.

254
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,067
Have one of those coconuts.

255
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:05,674
I'll cut it for you... this time.

256
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:13,741
Hey, you.

257
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:15,342
Hey, sweetie.

258
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:18,948
Stop it.

259
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:28,589
Emotionally right now, I feel crazy.

260
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,293
It's like I don't wanna do anything,

261
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,732
but I wanna do everything.

262
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:34,737
My mind goes nonstop and I just...

263
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:36,739
Uh-huh. I just shut down.

264
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:39,742
I'm trying to stay present,
you know what I mean?

265
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,268
Like just here, right
now, in this moment.

266
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:45,212
And not obsessing about the future,

267
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:46,977
"is it gonna happen,
is it not gonna happen?"

268
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:48,348
I hear that.

269
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,478
It's hard with Heslin.

270
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:53,079
And the crazy thing is, I know.

271
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:56,320
I see that he's thinking
about and dealing with girls.

272
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:00,595
And in our space, you know,

273
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:04,259
he doesn't have much privacy.

274
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:06,326
We don't have any privacy.

275
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:07,961
How's business?

276
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:10,506
It's all right, you know.

277
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,041
Kaleef is working hard.

278
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:14,077
You know how it is.

279
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:16,170
All right, so business is all right

280
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:18,147
and you live with an adolescent.

281
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:19,477
Yeah, in a nutshell.

282
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,915
(laughing)

283
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:22,350
Well, you're the nut.

284
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:25,354
Yes, I am the nut.

285
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:28,619
Speaking of nuts, Brian's crazy.

286
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,853
He wants to be a producer
all of the sudden.

287
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:32,361
Girl, he's making beats

288
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,363
and I gotta tell you,
they are atrocious.

289
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,955
Oh, no.

290
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:38,661
I'm lying my ass off all the time.

291
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:41,227
Telling him that I like them, you know?

292
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:44,240
'Cause I don't wanna hurt his feelings.

293
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:48,244
But the thing is, now he's
playing them all the time.

294
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:50,576
Kaleef started doing this weird thing

295
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:53,014
where he wants us to sleep
with our butts touching.

296
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,551
Wait a minute, Kaleef?
Your butts touching?

297
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:56,916
Yes!

298
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:58,852
Okay, now I've heard it all.

299
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:03,417
Now...

300
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,295
Deep breath.

301
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:13,193
(exhaling)

302
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,633
I love you.

303
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,181
I love you.

304
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:45,934
(woman) Hey, Bo.

305
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:48,233
Mmm...

306
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:50,398
I love these, oh.

307
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,200
Hey, Mom, question.

308
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:54,301
What?

309
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:57,836
You got like $100 I can borrow?

310
00:21:57,915 --> 00:21:59,143
What?

311
00:22:01,352 --> 00:22:03,286
You got like $100 I can borrow?

312
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:04,719
No.

313
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:06,312
Neither do I.

314
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,550
Tough guy, wise guy.

315
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,819
What do you think I am, huh?

316
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:10,326
What you think this is made out of, huh?

317
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:12,828
Let me see, put those
dukes up, all right?

318
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:14,125
$100 prize.

319
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:15,563
$100 prize!

320
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,366
(bell dinging)

321
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:23,499
I'll do anything.

322
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:25,838
There must be some work you need done.

323
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:37,745
(man) Come in.

324
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:43,049
(dogs barking)

325
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:02,138
(girl) Babo!

326
00:23:02,212 --> 00:23:03,611
What are you doing?

327
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:05,239
Shopping.

328
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,149
You smell that?

329
00:23:08,218 --> 00:23:10,618
Nah.

330
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:13,213
Anyway, I'm gonna invite
you to my birthday party

331
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,224
tonight at Angel Hall.

332
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,520
Lots of people are coming.

333
00:23:16,593 --> 00:23:18,060
It's gonna be fun.

334
00:23:18,128 --> 00:23:20,062
Oh, okay, that's cool.

335
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:23,659
Just make sure you take a shower.

336
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:32,669
(bells jingling)

337
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:35,211
(TV blaring)

338
00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:35,200
(siren blaring)

339
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:50,781
Hey, Ma, what's up?

340
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:53,950
What?

341
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:55,855
I said, what's up?

342
00:24:57,528 --> 00:24:58,859
What's up?

343
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,161
You smell that?

344
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:10,272
That you?

345
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,602
Nah.

346
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:18,040
I was wondering if you
wanna kick it later?

347
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:25,378
Listen, do you wanna hang later?

348
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,424
I'm busy.

349
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:30,187
You're busy?

350
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,423
Yeah, I'm busy.

351
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:36,489
Look, I like smart boys.

352
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,933
You're saying I ain't smart?

353
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:40,435
I'm smart.

354
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:50,970
(woman) Hi, come to
our march, October 7th.

355
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:53,073
Come to the march.

356
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,414
October 7th, come to our march.

357
00:25:55,486 --> 00:25:57,613
Take this please, thank you!

358
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,178
Hi, show this to your mom.

359
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:02,616
Come to our march.

360
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:27,739
(rock music blaring)

361
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:40,729
Hey...

362
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:49,267
I wanna get married

363
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,273
and have babies.

364
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:53,536
I wanna marry you.

365
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,841
I wanna cook... our house.

366
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:59,212
I wanna cook in our house.

367
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:01,308
I wanna get you a studio

368
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:04,081
so you can follow your dreams.

369
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:06,884
I want you to follow your dreams

370
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:08,891
and paint.

371
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:16,156
...and trees.

372
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:22,501
I saw it, I saw it.

373
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:24,768
I saw it.

374
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:27,810
Our future.

375
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:30,608
It's so good.

376
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:33,047
It just is so good.

377
00:27:35,018 --> 00:27:36,508
I know, baby.

378
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:39,352
Fuck you.

379
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:43,983
Fuck me.

380
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:45,858
Fuck me... fuck you.

381
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:51,667
How can you treat me like this?

382
00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:11,086
I'm gonna leave.

383
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:12,621
I'm gonna leave.

384
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:17,656
(man) Hello, good evening.

385
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:19,286
What would you two like?

386
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:23,993
I'll have the aloo gobi, please.

387
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:26,194
No ghee, please.

388
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,535
Um, I'll have the
saag paneer, thank you.

389
00:28:29,606 --> 00:28:30,903
Anything to drink?

390
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:32,874
I'll have a Coke.

391
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:34,672
I'll have the house red.

392
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:36,610
I'm sorry, no alcohol.

393
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,272
(laughing)

394
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:41,181
Um... I'll have a ginger ale.

395
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:44,647
Okay.

396
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:45,619
Okay, thank you.

397
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,122
You're welcome.

398
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,458
I thought you were leaving?

399
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:55,793
Fuck you!

400
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:26,561
(doorbell ringing)

401
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:37,533
Hola.

402
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:38,904
Hola.

403
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,007
Come.

404
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,546
Come, come in.

405
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,451
Can I get you anything to drink?

406
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,783
Nah, I'm good.

407
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:52,787
Are you sure?

408
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:54,915
I got some really good red wine.

409
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:59,857
Okay, I'll have one glass.

410
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,864
Okay.

411
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:03,695
I'll be right back.

412
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:30,457
(woman) Here we are.

413
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:43,104
Thank you.

414
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:44,572
You're welcome.

415
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:48,005
Cheers. Cheers.

416
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,950
(laughing)

417
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:10,996
Oh... okay.

418
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:13,194
Fuck, this is weird.

419
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,498
It's not weird.

420
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:15,868
This is what I do.

421
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:18,373
I deal with this on a daily basis.

422
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:21,172
So... and...

423
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:24,304
I covered all the instructions here,

424
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:27,782
so it's not like we
have to get anything now.

425
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:31,287
No, it's just embarrassing, you know?

426
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:32,412
What's so embarrassing?

427
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:34,116
I mean, everybody poops, Kelly.

428
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:37,854
Oh, oh, mmm, let me see this.

429
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:39,862
"Kaleef's Colon Cleanse."

430
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,591
Well, that's catchy.

431
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:43,724
I wonder how you came up with that one.

432
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,792
Ha-ha-ha.

433
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,771
And here's that, uh,

434
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,967
business proposal I
was talking you about.

435
00:31:55,512 --> 00:31:56,809
That was quick.

436
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,370
That's how I operate.

437
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:06,645
Grab it, grab it.

438
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:09,991
(clanking)

439
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:14,729
(huffing)

440
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:16,959
Yo, man, you okay?

441
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:19,968
Yeah, I'm all right.

442
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,804
You want a protein shake?

443
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:27,844
Okay.

444
00:32:57,073 --> 00:32:58,267
Fuck.

445
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:10,006
(laughing)

446
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,247
Sorry.

447
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:19,583
I'm sorry.

448
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:28,054
So your daddy's gonna give
you a "G," just like that?

449
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:29,860
Yeah, I ask.

450
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:32,458
I receive.

451
00:34:32,535 --> 00:34:34,526
What's mommy do?

452
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:37,664
She's dead.

453
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:39,470
Mine too.

454
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,772
Oh...

455
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:44,109
(laughing)

456
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:51,219
No, it's not funny.

457
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:53,016
It's not funny.

458
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:54,750
Sorry.

459
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:57,587
How'd she die?

460
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,322
Cancer.

461
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:01,261
Me too.

462
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:03,060
Ovarian?

463
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:04,191
Cervical.

464
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:06,132
Oh...

465
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:48,573
(reggae playing)

466
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,416
Ahh!

467
00:35:54,484 --> 00:35:56,349
I'm telling you, I'm real!

468
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:58,580
Then climb up that wall.

469
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:00,122
No!

470
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,555
Not right now.

471
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:03,285
You ain't real.

472
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,657
You must believe, son.

473
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:07,629
Now I must go.

474
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:44,265
# Try and change #

475
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:46,199
# Your perspective #

476
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:52,038
# And you might find #

477
00:36:52,108 --> 00:36:54,133
# You're perfected #

478
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,178
# You're perfected #

479
00:36:57,747 --> 00:37:00,079
# Just try and change #

480
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,141
# Your perspective #

481
00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:07,954
# And you might find #

482
00:37:08,024 --> 00:37:10,584
# You're perfected #

483
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,685
# Perfected #

484
00:37:12,762 --> 00:37:14,992
# Perfected ##

485
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:27,140
(Babo) You shouldn't smoke.

486
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,872
Yes, you are right.

487
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:33,545
But see...

488
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:35,948
at this current moment,

489
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:38,510
getting a little closer
to death is a good thing.

490
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,559
You're depressed?

491
00:37:52,435 --> 00:37:54,528
You want a piece of gum instead?

492
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:00,542
Sure.

493
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:10,644
Thanks.

494
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:18,283
I'm depressed too.

495
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:22,931
Oh, yeah?

496
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:25,832
What have you got to be depressed about?

497
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:28,462
The world.

498
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:30,802
I was reading this thing earlier

499
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:32,671
and it talked about all the poor people

500
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:35,040
in this country.

501
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:37,204
And it got me thinking

502
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,477
how poor my family is
and I got depressed.

503
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:44,417
Yeah, that's depressing.

504
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:48,785
You an actor?

505
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:50,189
Yeah, how'd you know?

506
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,626
'Cause you were playing a ninja.

507
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:54,185
Well...

508
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:56,596
yeah, but I just do this to...

509
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,725
for the money.

510
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,928
You wanna be making movies?

511
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:03,199
Yeah, yeah, and doing plays.

512
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:06,174
That's cool.

513
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:07,732
So what's your deal?

514
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,404
I'm just here 'cause a girl invited me.

515
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,777
Uh-huh.

516
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:13,713
You like her?

517
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:16,183
She's all right.

518
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:17,651
How old are you?

519
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,381
Seven.

520
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:20,581
You play chess?

521
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:22,352
I played like once.

522
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:24,256
You remember how to move the pieces?

523
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:26,659
Yeah, kind of.

524
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:27,855
Wanna play right now?

525
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:29,762
Sure.

526
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:40,273
White goes first, right?

527
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:41,401
Yep.

528
00:39:41,477 --> 00:39:43,172
You wanna be white?

529
00:39:43,246 --> 00:39:45,077
No, I'll be black instead.

530
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:04,326
Heslin?

531
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,731
Yeah, Mom?

532
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:09,329
Come here, I wanna talk
to you for a second.

533
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:10,929
Is there any way you
could come over here?

534
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:13,908
'Cause I'm about to
finish this final level.

535
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:17,003
Young man, you better just pause it.

536
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,071
Mom, please.

537
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:23,075
Okay.

538
00:40:25,788 --> 00:40:27,119
Pause it.

539
00:40:34,497 --> 00:40:37,864
Now, you know you can talk
to me about anything, right?

540
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:40,129
Uh-huh.

541
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:44,299
So... anything you wanna say to me?

542
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:46,342
No.

543
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:48,172
Hmm.

544
00:40:49,912 --> 00:40:51,436
Well...

545
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:58,178
I know you've been through my stuff.

546
00:40:58,254 --> 00:40:59,243
Oh.

547
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:01,688
Yeah.

548
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:03,851
So...

549
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:05,154
do you smoke weed?

550
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:06,752
Or does dad?

551
00:41:09,198 --> 00:41:12,634
I do.

552
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:15,000
Sweetie, this is a complex issue.

553
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:22,675
It opens me up and it...

554
00:41:22,745 --> 00:41:25,043
it helps me creatively.

555
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:27,139
It helps me...

556
00:41:27,216 --> 00:41:28,740
connect to my high powers,

557
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:31,685
part of my spiritual practice.

558
00:41:31,754 --> 00:41:34,882
But that doesn't mean you
can experiment right now.

559
00:41:34,957 --> 00:41:36,390
You're too young.

560
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:38,620
You need to learn how to be creative

561
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:40,184
and how to find your higher power

562
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:43,130
and how to be yourself on your own.

563
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:45,064
With nothing.

564
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:52,535
I don't get high all the time.

565
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:55,634
And, well, for me...

566
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,112
it's like going to church.

567
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:03,778
Mom, I ain't trying to smoke weed.

568
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:06,344
So don't worry.

569
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:08,322
Good.

570
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:10,325
No, no, no, no, no.

571
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:12,020
We're not done yet.

572
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,799
So you having sex yet?

573
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:20,335
It's okay if you have or you haven't.

574
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:21,961
It's fine.

575
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:24,700
I know.

576
00:42:24,774 --> 00:42:26,901
Actually, umm...

577
00:42:26,976 --> 00:42:28,534
it's none of your business.

578
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:33,072
Okay, all right.

579
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:36,516
No, you're right, it's personal.

580
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:40,113
But as your mother, I have to tell you.

581
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:42,453
No matter what, Heslin,

582
00:42:42,525 --> 00:42:44,356
always wear a condom, okay?

583
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:46,827
Mom, I know.

584
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:49,626
Please.

585
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:52,600
Oh, you're a good boy.

586
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:55,136
You must have great parents.

587
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:04,808
(video game blaring)

588
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:36,402
Yep. You all set?

589
00:43:58,367 --> 00:43:59,857
Morning.

590
00:44:06,442 --> 00:44:08,342
You wear glasses?

591
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:10,208
Oh, usually I just wear my contacts.

592
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,386
What books you reading?

593
00:44:20,456 --> 00:44:24,449
Oh, "Flowers From the
Storm" by Laura Kinsale.

594
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:42,074
What's it about?

595
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:44,305
Oh, actually, I just started reading it.

596
00:44:47,483 --> 00:44:49,383
Do you have a lot of No. Homework?

597
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:52,182
Well, if you ever need a
study buddy, I'm around.

598
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:01,561
(Kaleef) It's a movie.

599
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,393
Five words. Five words.

600
00:45:14,577 --> 00:45:16,477
(laughing)

601
00:45:19,882 --> 00:45:20,814
I don't know.

602
00:45:20,883 --> 00:45:22,316
What is she doing?

603
00:45:25,688 --> 00:45:27,656
I got it, it's "Willow."

604
00:45:27,723 --> 00:45:29,156
(laughing)

605
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:30,749
What?

606
00:45:30,826 --> 00:45:33,056
What's "Willow"? Come on, guys.

607
00:45:33,129 --> 00:45:35,188
It's "Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory."

608
00:45:35,264 --> 00:45:38,165
I'm like an Oompa-Loompa.

609
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:40,065
(man) Pops, I love you.

610
00:45:42,138 --> 00:45:44,368
I think about you every day.

611
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:50,507
I miss you.

612
00:45:52,782 --> 00:45:54,545
I need you.

613
00:45:57,787 --> 00:45:59,812
I need your energy.

614
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:06,659
I need to be blessed.

615
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:17,835
Now things are hard.

616
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:24,306
I'm not where I'm supposed to be.

617
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:31,250
I'm 25 now.

618
00:46:32,855 --> 00:46:35,585
And...

619
00:46:35,658 --> 00:46:37,683
I feel like I should be holding it down.

620
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:45,527
Acting's tough.

621
00:46:49,338 --> 00:46:50,862
Y'know, it's wearing on me.

622
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,272
It's... my thinking.

623
00:46:57,313 --> 00:46:59,975
I'm getting nervous that it's slipping.

624
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:04,910
All the time.

625
00:47:08,991 --> 00:47:11,824
And... I don't know what to do.

626
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:20,097
I mean, she's a'ight.

627
00:47:20,169 --> 00:47:21,466
Her face is a little chubby, though.

628
00:47:22,872 --> 00:47:25,705
Can I talk to you for a second?

629
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:27,402
You wanna talk to me?

630
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:28,909
Yeah.

631
00:47:55,004 --> 00:47:56,562
I told the guy at the
store what I thought

632
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:58,300
your height and weight was.

633
00:47:58,374 --> 00:48:00,069
And he guessed you were a nine.

634
00:48:00,142 --> 00:48:01,609
So that's what I got.

635
00:48:01,677 --> 00:48:03,235
But you can return them.

636
00:48:07,283 --> 00:48:08,978
You got these for me?

637
00:48:09,051 --> 00:48:10,484
Yeah.

638
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:15,182
Nine's my size.

639
00:48:15,257 --> 00:48:16,724
Well, there you go.

640
00:48:25,434 --> 00:48:27,868
(no sound)

641
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:32,818
(buzzer ringing)

642
00:51:56,178 --> 00:51:57,338
Sit down.

643
00:52:02,618 --> 00:52:04,677
Or I blow your head to smithereens.

644
00:52:06,955 --> 00:52:08,286
Fuck.

645
00:52:16,832 --> 00:52:18,265
Give me your bag.

646
00:52:40,622 --> 00:52:42,112
Empty your pockets.

647
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:57,229
(moaning)

648
00:53:18,794 --> 00:53:19,954
(gun cocking)

649
00:53:28,036 --> 00:53:29,196
(trigger clicking)

650
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:35,067
(grunting)

651
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:49,388
(woman) And now to close practice,

652
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:52,359
please join me in a deep-cleansing om.

653
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:01,192
(all) Om...

654
00:54:14,016 --> 00:54:15,950
Namaste.

655
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:17,645
(all) Namaste.

656
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:24,225
And now lay back on your
mats and rest in Savasana.

657
00:54:51,887 --> 00:54:53,411
What?

658
00:54:56,859 --> 00:54:58,190
What?

659
00:55:00,796 --> 00:55:03,424
(whispering) I got the
money for the store.

660
00:55:03,498 --> 00:55:05,989
It's all yours.

661
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:07,660
Are you serious?

662
00:55:09,705 --> 00:55:11,229
Thank you!

663
00:55:11,306 --> 00:55:13,433
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you!

664
00:55:20,515 --> 00:55:23,177
(gagging)

665
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,355
Ahh!

666
00:56:42,364 --> 00:56:44,423
Ahh! Ahh!

667
00:56:44,499 --> 00:56:47,093
Rocco takes the rook!

668
00:56:47,169 --> 00:56:49,228
And now you're shook.

669
00:56:49,304 --> 00:56:52,705
Gonna try to book away
because I'm one check away.

670
00:56:52,774 --> 00:56:56,335
(laughing)

671
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:58,174
Don't need to spaz out.

672
00:56:58,246 --> 00:57:00,180
I mean, it was a pretty
sick freestyle, but...

673
00:57:00,248 --> 00:57:02,842
(wheezing)

674
00:57:02,918 --> 00:57:05,318
Whoa, hey, Babo, you okay?

675
00:57:05,387 --> 00:57:06,649
Oh, my God.

676
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:08,246
Babo, you having an asthma attack?

677
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:09,551
Hey, somebody help!

678
00:57:09,624 --> 00:57:10,921
Somebody!

679
00:57:10,993 --> 00:57:13,223
Hey, Babo, just breathe
for me, buddy, just breathe.

680
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:14,421
I'm gonna get you some help.

681
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:16,361
Hey, somebody help, please!

682
00:57:16,431 --> 00:57:18,661
Please, somebody help
me! Call an ambulance!

683
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:21,498
Hey, hey, Babo, just
breathe, buddy, okay?

684
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,094
I'm gonna get us an ambulance, okay,

685
00:57:23,171 --> 00:57:25,105
and then I'm gonna call your mom

686
00:57:25,173 --> 00:57:27,767
and we're gonna get
your mom out here, okay?

687
00:57:27,843 --> 00:57:29,435
And we're gonna get her over here

688
00:57:29,511 --> 00:57:30,569
and we're gonna get some help.

689
00:57:30,645 --> 00:57:32,237
Okay, I'm going to put you down, okay?

690
00:57:32,314 --> 00:57:33,906
Now I just need you to breathe for me.

691
00:57:33,982 --> 00:57:35,415
Hello, hello?

692
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:39,284
Can I get an ambulance, please,
to 23rd and Pine Street?!

693
00:57:39,354 --> 00:57:40,548
Yeah, I've got a
seven-year-old kid here

694
00:57:40,622 --> 00:57:42,214
who's having an asthma attack.

695
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:43,985
Hey, Babo, buddy, just
breathe for me, okay?

696
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:45,993
Just breathe... hey, look at
me, look at me, look at me.

697
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:48,086
Hey, just breathe, okay,
we're gonna get your mom here

698
00:57:48,163 --> 00:57:49,460
and she's gonna take care of everything.

699
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:50,930
Yes, please hurry.

700
00:57:50,999 --> 00:57:53,229
There used to be an
old brewery over there.

701
00:57:53,301 --> 00:57:55,531
Me and my boys would
go there all the time.

702
00:57:55,604 --> 00:57:57,868
It was crazy.

703
00:57:57,939 --> 00:58:00,032
Saw a ghost in there once, too.

704
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:01,075
For real?

705
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:02,269
Yeah.

706
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:04,835
You believe in ghosts?

707
00:58:04,913 --> 00:58:06,471
Yeah.

708
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:11,909
I saw my grandma's
ghost at my dad's house.

709
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:14,353
Really?

710
00:58:14,423 --> 00:58:17,017
What'd you see?

711
00:58:17,092 --> 00:58:19,788
Well...

712
00:58:19,861 --> 00:58:22,489
I was laying on the
couch in the living room,

713
00:58:22,564 --> 00:58:24,191
watching TV,

714
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:27,099
and out of the corner of my eye,

715
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:30,297
I saw something moving
real slow down the steps.

716
00:58:30,372 --> 00:58:33,933
So... I mute the TV

717
00:58:34,009 --> 00:58:35,670
and turn and look.

718
00:58:35,744 --> 00:58:37,405
It's my grandma.

719
00:58:37,479 --> 00:58:40,710
And I just... freeze up.

720
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:43,376
She smiles at me and then disappears.

721
00:58:45,287 --> 00:58:47,619
Were you scared?

722
00:58:47,689 --> 00:58:49,213
It was too quick,

723
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:52,158
but after... yeah.

724
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:54,388
I didn't know what to do.

725
00:58:54,463 --> 00:58:56,055
No one believes me.

726
00:58:59,367 --> 00:59:00,732
I believe you.

727
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:07,472
(woman on PA) Dr.
Forest, dial 118, please.

728
00:59:07,542 --> 00:59:10,636
Dr. Forest,
please dial 1-1-8.

729
00:59:23,592 --> 00:59:26,152
Just don't let me fall asleep.

730
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:28,253
(laughing)

731
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:39,239
No, he's fine, he's fine.

732
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:42,902
Thank God.

733
00:59:46,615 --> 00:59:48,845
Gentrification's what it's called.

734
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:51,750
Basically means they kick
out all the poor people,

735
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,812
tear down their homes, build
million-dollar buildings

736
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,518
so that they can get rich
people to live in them.

737
00:59:57,592 --> 01:00:00,060
Then they make millions.

738
01:00:00,128 --> 01:00:01,755
That's why this place is so fancy.

739
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:05,233
That's messed up.

740
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,392
Yeah.

741
01:00:06,468 --> 01:00:08,026
I hate yuppies.

742
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:09,934
Then why did you bring us here?

743
01:00:10,005 --> 01:00:13,031
It's good pizza.

744
01:00:13,108 --> 01:00:15,042
Well, I think you shouldn't hate anyone,

745
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:16,270
no matter what they do.

746
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:18,244
Yeah, I agree.

747
01:00:20,215 --> 01:00:22,240
You're funny.

748
01:00:22,317 --> 01:00:24,410
What?

749
01:00:24,486 --> 01:00:26,181
The way you talk.

750
01:00:29,157 --> 01:00:31,148
Do you have insurance?

751
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:32,250
No.

752
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:38,524
It's going to be $52.67 then.

753
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,329
$52?

754
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:42,029
Yes, ma'am.

755
01:00:43,939 --> 01:00:46,134
That's insane.

756
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,301
Look...

757
01:00:48,376 --> 01:00:51,607
Iook, I don't have that kind
of money on me right now.

758
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,205
Is there anyway that I
could get the medicine

759
01:00:54,282 --> 01:00:56,614
for what it would be if I had insurance?

760
01:00:56,685 --> 01:00:57,947
And then, I swear to God,

761
01:00:58,019 --> 01:01:00,317
tomorrow I will pay you the rest.

762
01:01:00,388 --> 01:01:01,719
Look, ma'am, if it were up to me,

763
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,621
I would, but I just can't do that.

764
01:01:03,692 --> 01:01:05,216
It's against the policy.

765
01:01:05,293 --> 01:01:06,385
You can.

766
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:08,258
Look, my son just got
out of the emergency room.

767
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,230
He really needs his medicine tonight.

768
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:11,322
I'm sorry, ma'am.

769
01:01:11,399 --> 01:01:13,128
Like I said, there's nothing I can do.

770
01:01:17,606 --> 01:01:19,233
This is fucking crazy.

771
01:01:22,577 --> 01:01:24,875
I'm sorry, can I just talk
to your manager, please?

772
01:01:26,615 --> 01:01:28,105
I am the manager.

773
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:31,542
Look, ma'am, could you step aside

774
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,746
so I can help this customer?

775
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:34,686
This is bullshit!

776
01:01:34,756 --> 01:01:36,087
Okay, customer?

777
01:01:36,157 --> 01:01:37,715
Yeah, 'cause that's what we
are, we're customers, right?

778
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:39,726
We're not sick people, we're customers.

779
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:41,819
Look, ma'am, you're
gonna have to calm down.

780
01:01:41,896 --> 01:01:43,727
You know what, you need
to stop calling me "ma'am,"

781
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:45,663
first of all like you fucking give
a shit. Escorted out. Ave to have you

782
01:01:45,734 --> 01:01:47,201
And don't tell me to calm down.

783
01:01:47,269 --> 01:01:49,703
Mommy, let's just go home, okay?

784
01:01:53,608 --> 01:01:54,575
Okay, come on.

785
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:56,804
Let's go.

786
01:01:56,878 --> 01:01:59,108
I promise you, I'm fine.

787
01:02:01,049 --> 01:02:02,539
I'm sorry.

788
01:02:06,655 --> 01:02:08,623
Okay, I'll take you home, okay.

789
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:11,424
That's a good boy.

790
01:02:11,493 --> 01:02:12,551
Excuse me.

791
01:02:14,496 --> 01:02:17,761
So what'd you tell them?

792
01:02:17,832 --> 01:02:19,857
That I fell off my bike.

793
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,835
This is depressing.

794
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:33,645
Yeah.

795
01:02:33,715 --> 01:02:35,546
But it's good for us as artists.

796
01:02:37,052 --> 01:02:39,043
(laughing)

797
01:02:46,261 --> 01:02:48,388
Yeah. So you wanna stop?

798
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:52,899
For how long?

799
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:57,870
Don't make me laugh.

800
01:02:59,407 --> 01:03:01,341
For as long as possible.

801
01:03:03,144 --> 01:03:06,011
I know.

802
01:03:06,081 --> 01:03:07,912
I know.

803
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:17,491
Let's do it.

804
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:20,153
No nothing.

805
01:03:20,228 --> 01:03:22,696
Promise?

806
01:03:22,764 --> 01:03:24,629
I promise.

807
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:28,229
Pinkie swear?

808
01:03:47,255 --> 01:03:48,688
Ooh...

809
01:03:53,762 --> 01:03:55,627
(woman) Rah!

810
01:03:55,697 --> 01:03:57,756
(Kaleef) You scared the
shit out of me, girl.

811
01:03:57,832 --> 01:03:59,561
Good.

812
01:04:07,008 --> 01:04:08,236
What's all this?

813
01:04:08,309 --> 01:04:12,211
You know, I just made
a little dinner for us.

814
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,907
Where's Heslin?

815
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:16,576
At Tony's house.

816
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:18,676
Okay.

817
01:04:18,753 --> 01:04:19,777
What's going on?

818
01:04:19,854 --> 01:04:21,788
You just sit your ass down.

819
01:04:21,856 --> 01:04:23,221
Yes, ma'am.

820
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:30,856
Okay, what is going on?

821
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,861
We got the money for the store.

822
01:04:34,936 --> 01:04:36,665
What?

823
01:04:36,738 --> 01:04:38,797
We got the money for the store, baby.

824
01:04:38,873 --> 01:04:40,363
What?

825
01:04:40,442 --> 01:04:42,535
(laughing)

826
01:04:43,678 --> 01:04:45,373
(woman) You're a lifesaver.

827
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:49,013
Okay, see you in the morning.

828
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,414
Bye.

829
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:51,884
Thank you.

830
01:04:54,656 --> 01:04:56,214
How's your book?

831
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:59,021
It's good, but kinda sad so far.

832
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:00,617
Oh.

833
01:05:03,598 --> 01:05:05,964
You really should eat something, honey.

834
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:17,077
So Rocco says he's gonna
come by tomorrow and hang out.

835
01:05:17,145 --> 01:05:19,409
Yeah. Really?

836
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:21,073
I got to get up really
early in the morning

837
01:05:21,149 --> 01:05:23,310
and handle a few things.

838
01:05:23,384 --> 01:05:25,045
You know I'm going to
make you a million dollars

839
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,088
by the time I'm 15, right?

840
01:05:28,156 --> 01:05:30,090
Yeah, I know.

841
01:05:31,493 --> 01:05:33,051
Eat.

842
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:43,935
I'm gonna go to sleep.

843
01:05:44,005 --> 01:05:45,632
Okay.

844
01:05:47,442 --> 01:05:48,807
Good night, my angel.

845
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:49,866
Good night.

846
01:05:49,944 --> 01:05:50,933
I love you.

847
01:05:51,012 --> 01:05:52,479
I love you, too.

848
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:09,826
I should go.

849
01:06:09,898 --> 01:06:12,093
It's getting late and
I'm gonna get in trouble.

850
01:06:22,977 --> 01:06:25,172
Okay, I'll take the "L" with you.

851
01:06:30,919 --> 01:06:32,477
(dog barking)

852
01:06:37,425 --> 01:06:41,418
Okay, let's go.

853
01:06:41,496 --> 01:06:43,123
Okay.

854
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:48,699
You're a really good kisser.

855
01:06:58,112 --> 01:07:00,376
You could finish painting me blue.

856
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:16,163
(humming)

857
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:44,015
(humming)

858
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,456
Babo.

859
01:10:03,464 --> 01:10:05,398
Babo.

860
01:10:05,466 --> 01:10:06,865
Babo!

861
01:10:06,934 --> 01:10:08,458
Babo!

862
01:10:08,536 --> 01:10:09,696
Babo!

863
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:10,897
Come on, baby.

864
01:10:10,972 --> 01:10:13,270
Come on, baby, breathe.

865
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:16,242
Why aren't you breathing?

866
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:19,438
Why aren't you breathing?

867
01:10:19,514 --> 01:10:20,947
Why aren't you breathing?

868
01:10:21,015 --> 01:10:24,507
Babo, Babo, Babo, okay, don't...

869
01:10:24,585 --> 01:10:27,645
(sobbing)

870
01:10:27,722 --> 01:10:30,213
I don't like this game!

871
01:10:33,528 --> 01:10:36,053
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

872
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:39,065
Babo, Babo, Babo...

873
01:10:41,335 --> 01:10:43,064
My baby.

874
01:10:46,741 --> 01:10:48,971
My baby!

875
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:51,739
No!

876
01:11:08,496 --> 01:11:12,728
(woman sobbing)

877
01:11:17,538 --> 01:11:20,006
I wanna go home, I wanna go home...

878
01:11:20,074 --> 01:11:22,133
I wanna take my baby home.

879
01:11:27,315 --> 01:11:29,840
(crying)

880
01:11:55,743 --> 01:11:58,541
(crying)

881
01:11:59,747 --> 01:12:01,408
Oh, my God!

882
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:06,843
Oh, my God!

883
01:13:48,255 --> 01:13:51,952
(sobbing)

884
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,997
(boy) It's weird how one
minute we can be here,

885
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:06,528
and the next second... gone.

886
01:14:06,607 --> 01:14:08,131
It's like a dream.

887
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,271
A bad dream.

888
01:14:13,748 --> 01:14:16,216
It makes me wanna be
more careful in life.

889
01:14:16,283 --> 01:14:17,341
Focus even more.

890
01:14:22,189 --> 01:14:24,089
Pay attention to the details.

891
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:27,286
He was a good kid.

892
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:32,194
(bell dinging)

893
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:34,291
(boy) So what are you doing tomorrow?

894
01:14:35,736 --> 01:14:37,328
(girl) Nothing really.

895
01:14:37,405 --> 01:14:39,168
I have to do laundry with
my dad in the afternoon,

896
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,834
but that's it.

897
01:14:41,909 --> 01:14:45,208
Well, do you still
wanna keep hanging out?

898
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:46,610
You mean tomorrow?

899
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,672
Nah, I mean...

900
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,012
for a while.

901
01:15:00,194 --> 01:15:03,425
You wanna be my boyfriend?

902
01:15:03,497 --> 01:15:05,192
I want you to be my girlfriend.

903
01:15:10,638 --> 01:15:12,037
Okay.

904
01:15:12,106 --> 01:15:13,334
Good.

905
01:15:21,816 --> 01:15:23,477
He was so young.

906
01:15:23,551 --> 01:15:25,917
Yeah.

907
01:15:25,986 --> 01:15:29,217
You know... I hope we see his ghost.

908
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:31,315
Yeah, me too.

909
01:15:33,861 --> 01:15:35,419
Would you...

910
01:15:35,496 --> 01:15:38,897
rather be cremated or buried?

911
01:15:42,603 --> 01:15:45,436
I think I would rather be...

912
01:15:45,506 --> 01:15:48,737
buried, be in the earth.

913
01:15:48,809 --> 01:15:51,676
See, I would be cremated

914
01:15:51,745 --> 01:15:54,578
and sprinkled over the ocean.

915
01:15:54,648 --> 01:15:56,548
Be with the earth that way, too.

916
01:15:59,687 --> 01:16:02,121
She's gonna keep his ashes.

917
01:16:02,189 --> 01:16:04,350
Yeah.

918
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:09,653
Do you wanna sit for a little bit?

919
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,129
Yeah.

920
01:16:18,539 --> 01:16:19,733
So hot out.

921
01:16:24,912 --> 01:16:27,608
You two just get married?

922
01:16:27,681 --> 01:16:28,579
Yes.

923
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:29,946
(laughing)

924
01:16:30,017 --> 01:16:32,144
Hey, you guys want me
to take your picture?

925
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:34,244
Sure.

926
01:16:34,321 --> 01:16:35,811
All right.

927
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:37,050
This is nice.

928
01:16:37,124 --> 01:16:38,489
Big smile.

929
01:16:38,559 --> 01:16:39,719
(camera clicking)

930
01:16:41,262 --> 01:16:42,786
There you go.

931
01:16:42,863 --> 01:16:43,887
Thank you.

932
01:16:43,964 --> 01:16:45,488
You're very welcome.

933
01:16:45,566 --> 01:16:47,295
You two have a wonderful day!

934
01:16:47,368 --> 01:16:48,835
You too.

935
01:16:54,308 --> 01:16:56,208
It's nice.

936
01:16:58,746 --> 01:16:59,940
Honeymoon?

937
01:17:00,014 --> 01:17:01,447
Shut up.

938
01:17:42,556 --> 01:17:44,251
Congratulations on the store, man.

939
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:45,792
Thanks a lot, Chris.

940
01:17:47,528 --> 01:17:49,962
Produce for the people
and all that, y'know.

941
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:51,861
So what's next?

942
01:17:51,932 --> 01:17:53,729
About three weeks of renovations.

943
01:17:53,801 --> 01:17:54,768
That's it?

944
01:17:54,835 --> 01:17:56,132
Yeah, yeah, well, the
place is already in

945
01:17:56,203 --> 01:17:57,568
pretty good condition, so...

946
01:17:57,638 --> 01:17:59,196
Cool.

947
01:18:00,341 --> 01:18:02,275
I got big news, too.

948
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:03,970
Really? What?

949
01:18:04,044 --> 01:18:06,274
The mother of that boy who died...

950
01:18:06,347 --> 01:18:07,837
she's coming.

951
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:08,882
You're not gonna believe this,

952
01:18:08,949 --> 01:18:11,611
but apparently her son who died

953
01:18:11,685 --> 01:18:15,883
gave her a flier he'd gotten
just a few days beforehand.

954
01:18:19,526 --> 01:18:20,788
Yeah.

955
01:18:20,861 --> 01:18:22,158
Yo.

956
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:23,753
Let's do this, gentlemen.

957
01:18:39,146 --> 01:18:40,807
I miss you.

958
01:18:40,881 --> 01:18:44,783
I hope wherever you are, you're okay.

959
01:18:44,852 --> 01:18:47,787
Thanks for coming to my party.

960
01:18:47,855 --> 01:18:49,686
God bless you.

961
01:18:49,757 --> 01:18:50,951
Amen.

962
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:06,263
(woman) No wait, don't come in.

963
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,865
I won't look.

964
01:19:08,942 --> 01:19:10,239
Okay, fine.

965
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:23,356
Oh, shit, it's today.

966
01:19:23,424 --> 01:19:24,789
What's today?

967
01:19:27,795 --> 01:19:29,319
This.

968
01:19:38,105 --> 01:19:40,232
We should go.

969
01:19:40,307 --> 01:19:43,037
It would be good to get out
of our heads for a second.

970
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:44,543
Okay.

971
01:19:46,313 --> 01:19:48,338
What time is it again?

972
01:19:48,415 --> 01:19:49,973
It's 4:00.

973
01:19:51,418 --> 01:19:52,544
Okay.

974
01:20:10,604 --> 01:20:12,094
I'm done.

975
01:20:13,907 --> 01:20:14,771
Can I look now?

976
01:20:14,842 --> 01:20:17,037
Hold on.

977
01:20:17,111 --> 01:20:18,669
Hold on.

978
01:20:29,723 --> 01:20:31,213
Stand.

979
01:20:59,286 --> 01:21:01,447
(man) They say cutback!
We say fight back!

980
01:21:01,522 --> 01:21:02,750
They say cutback!

981
01:21:02,823 --> 01:21:03,949
We say fight back!

982
01:21:04,024 --> 01:21:05,321

983
01:21:05,392 --> 01:21:06,723
We say fight back!

984

985
01:21:07,995 --> 01:21:09,223

988
01:21:11,632 --> 01:21:12,758
They say cutback!

989
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:13,993
We say fight back!

990
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:15,432
They say cutback!

991
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:16,867
We say fight back!

992
01:21:16,937 --> 01:21:18,427
What do we want? Health care!

993
01:21:18,505 --> 01:21:19,904
When do we want it? Now!

994
01:21:19,973 --> 01:21:21,565

01:21:21,642 --> 01:21:23,234

(all) Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

1029
01:22:14,895 --> 01:22:16,385
Poverty has got to go!

Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:31,872

end this...

1055
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:14,110
with a moment of silence...

1056
01:24:16,717 --> 01:24:20,483
for our dear friend, Babo.

1057
01:24:20,554 --> 01:24:22,749
He passed away...

1058
01:24:22,823 --> 01:24:25,758
because he didn't have health care...

1059
01:24:28,762 --> 01:24:30,923
