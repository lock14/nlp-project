My name is Benjamin Keynes.
I work for the department operations,
of the CIA.
Three days after 9 / 11,
picks up satellites
a radioactive signal,
in a remote part of Afghanistan.
The CIA feared that Al Qaeda
a nuclear weapon is secured.
I got information
of a reliable local source,
that perhaps something much more powerful.
It is more than a decade ago,
I have since departed.
I forgot how bad it could be.
I have the feeling that every time,
as we enter this country, we want uitspugen.
Almost everyone here has too busy
with the search for a war,
making them no attention to me.
And that's a good thing.
Sir, agent Keynes.
I finally met
the commander and team leader,
Sergeant Wallis Hamer.
I gave them the official story,
as if I voorlas from the memos in Langley.
Major Keynes, it is perhaps your party,
but they are men, okay?
Sure.
They thought that I lied.
My first assignment was contacted,
with my local source, Mohammed Aban.
He asked me to come, so I hope
that he is there, if we are to knock him.
Sir, the men are ready for you
Major Keynes,
let me suggest one of the men.
This is my teamoudste, Tanner,
Information officer also.
He gets us back within a day.
Our doctor, sergeant Degetau.
-- How does it.
Explosives, Trinoski sergeant.
That there on the floor is sergeant Cole.
And last but not least, sergeant Sadler,
weapons and Afghanistan expert.
392 is a good team, you will find no better.
That is why I am here.
Gentlemen, thank you that you
at such short notice, wanted.
My orders are about the contact
with a certain Mohammed Aban.
A spiritual,
who lives in the southern provinces.
We want a recorded statement from him,
which he supports the U.S. mission here.
This is our man.
Look good.
Aban is highly respected
by the local population.
He is seen as the spiritual strength,
that the Mujahadin helped the Soviets to beat.
I thought that the CIA, the spiritual
force, which helped the Soviets to beat.
That depends on your definition,
of mental sergeant.
Aban was in hiding for the Taliban,
so it is important that we make contact,
once we have visibility of his position.
When we arrived there, we make contact
and we disappear again.
Smiles to the population,
conquer hearts, no doors-stroke, okay?
The mission will start at 1400 hours.
0130 inspection.
0230 departure.
-- We go.
Remember, nothing is routine.
Special Forces team 392.
I had heard of them.
She worked in the Zagran.
Smart men, they can handle secrets.
Vigorous as necessary.
A nice camera.
I gave my wife a wedding on our,
they do not know how they 'm to use.
But because his hair
never late, Ski.
What a man gives his wife
Now a camera on her wedding day.
Very romantic, Ski.
-- They used 'm for the baby, if it comes.
I would not want to be your wife,
legs spread and the child while filming.
Her sister, the recordings,
but they also know yet how it works.
But I mean, do not be surprised
bruinverbrand as that baby is born.
Two minutes.
Okay, you ready for this.
When I stepped from the helicopter,
I got a sense of enlightenment.
The time for a reconsideration is over.
The goal is all that counts.
I have no other choice,
then the goal.
It looks pretty quiet out from here.
-- Dan, I am always the most concern.
We can better establish an observatory.
Yes, ga with Pete to that hill,
Please indicate if it is safe to go.
For the others. Keynes and I
are the begroetingscomite. We go first.
Keynes, are you ready?
-- Yes, let's go.
Keep your eyes open.
It can wemelen of the enemies.
Hello.
Let me talk with her.
Good morning, how are today.
We come in peace.
We'd like Mohammed Aban.
Mohammed Aban live here no more.
He lives in the holy mountains.
Only the village elders know where that is.
Sorry. We would be honoured
Mohammed Aban to speak.
If he would like to help us,
that is good for your tribe.
Follow me.
Thank you!
There is nothing changed,
since my last stay.
You can only to the color of
Uniforms, in which period you are.
Hello, we are looking Mohammed Aban.
Aban nam, a week before the orders came
to be here to be executed, contact.
He had little coherent
and I thought ie lost his mind.
That was, that we saw themselves.
My grandfather said that he departed,
because the Taliban had killed him otherwise.
The woman with whom we spoke told
that he was in the mountains, you know where?
This is sacred ground, the Taliban have not come,
that is forbidden by God, Allah.
I understand it.
-- What do you want, chocolate?
This is special, from New York.
What you will find here.
And this, you are smart, eh?
It seems,
as if we are back behind ghosts maximum capacity.
It is ghostly, eh?
Hey, did you cope with camera
good view?
No, what is there.
-- That you do not buy in a regular store.
Give me the radio.
Snake 76. Snake 76.
This beast is 92, left.
Hose 76, the packet is not here,
request to be met back on.
Can I use my camera?
I want the Americans to show
how the house
of a holy man looks like.
We found Aban's house,
but we had now found evidence?
I wonder,
what these people would do,
when they suddenly came to power,
to destroy a nation.
We can only hope,
that they have become tired of the fighting.
Eat please.
Why do you want to speak with our holy?
We want an explanation from him,
to liberate your country from the Taliban.
My grandfather says that nobody
Afghanistan freed of the Taliban,
that can only Allah.
I believe that Allah gave us in your area.
Most Americans
realize that just yet.
Do you know where those sacred mountains?
Yes, my father took me
a few years ago.
He showed where he wanted to be buried,
since it is now too late, he was kidnapped
by the Taliban, I fear that he is dead.
Is this holy place 'Dashtun'?
How do you know that?
I've lived here long ago.
I see the desert in your eyes.
-- What he said?
I think that he can help us.
-- You have until 0300, then we leave.
I must call.
-- Cole, the satelliettelefoon.
No, I have my own.
-- He has his own.
Just a damned James Bond.
-- You know James Bond?
Yes, I know him.
He dropped to his basic training.
I told HQ
I continued to phase two.
She said that the footprint faded.
So they called the hittespoor,
that was seen by the satellite.
Chief.
That was your death can be.
-- We should talk a change.
Let's important.
The orders are, in order to go behind Aban
Now we have new information.
Information?
That nonsense that Obi-Wan told?
We suspected that Aban in the mountains Saturday.
We had the first time here.
We talk about two, up to three days,
for me to help this man to find.
Excuse me, but I ga even this check.
If he once knew,
we have no choice.
Man, d'r is no place to shit.
Hey, did you have chocolate?
I've already given you everything yesterday.
I have old cigars.
Hearts and minds, man.
-- What you want to step into.
Sorry boys.
What does he here?
He offered to be our guide.
-- We are full, you see that?
Someone who knows the environment,
ensures that we can be much faster.
That snap me,
but here the stikt of the enemies.
The time we win,
We lost because we need him.
Listen, I fought with my father,
I can adapt itself to me.
Well, do our part but rations with him.
We're going.
Abdul, ga not those Americans.
It is not safe for you.
It will go pretty well mother.
I earn a lot of money for the family.
I forbid you, your grandfather forbids it.
Stay at home, your father would not find.
I earn ten times as much on the market,
Please mother, I must go.
It is my mother but, row on.
I'm back soon. Beware grandfather.
Wherever we go, says the technique little.
50 dollars to a man from here,
let millions of dollars a duration
GPS system undertaken,
if you outages,
or your battery dies.
There was too much at stake.
Chief, I know we have our orders,
but we are quite vulnerable here.
I also think it is nothing,
but I am the boss now.
For us that you did.
Everything here seems to me the same.
At home, there is occasionally a pitch.
Cole where are you from?
-- Tampa, Florida, born and raised.
And you?
-- Chicago.
Stop.
What is he planning?
-- No idea.
We must continue.
What is the pe to do?
Why stop us on?
Therefore.
-- Potverdomme.
She said that this road was clean.
-- That was probably so ...
Look, you see that hole?
It looks like someone has dug.
-- That, I believe.
Good work Keynes.
You have saved us a bad day.
Let me guess,
we are going through that ravine.
Yes, that's right.
There are few places on earth,
as unforgivable as this desert.
Entire armies,
from those of Alexander to the Soviets,
The price paid
because they wanted to possess.
I hope that we are not so dumb.
That is wrong bunch.
It must be a trap.
-- Cole, back row.
Wait I look Ga.
-- No, do not.
Ski is concerned.
Let me take a look.
Chief, Ski severe bleeding.
Keep that for me, okay.
Chief, he was seriously injured.
Cole, come here to work there.
Reload, ga that direction,
and link those bastards.
Come.
Reload.
Walk through.
Pete, Keynes, deck them.
-- Okay.
Come.
I must try to close it.
Are you OK?
Check the RGP weft,
find out who that.
Is your friend's survival?
God has forgotten this place.
Are you sure that it was here?
-- Yes, the first here crept out the ditch.
Maybe you've only injured.
-- Certainly not.
I saw that they were hit.
That one was a hoofdschot,
the other in the chest.
I saw them neervallen.
Where are the bodies?
-- This is a good question.
Those guys do not know,
that they bring their dead.
I have you.
I have you.
Damn.
The heart was hit,
I could not stop the bleeding.
You did what you could,
we lay him in the truck, come.
The only dead in that battle,
There was one of us.
Incomprehensible.
As far as I know,
ghosts do not shoot with real bullets.
Hose 76, 76 snake.
This beast is 92.
I repeat,
92 beast requires to be picked up.
With a gesneuvelde on.
How does it look like?
Not good, the radiator is concerned.
Can you fix it?
-- Maybe the small holes, not that great.
This is also affected.
Okay, Abdul says that there is a roadblock.
That leads us to the mountain.
That is a half-day
to our next checkpunt.
Item? Maybe you have not heard.
But we'll let us pick up.
Listen, I'm sorry, Trinoski,
but stop the mission, is not an option.
We have more than enough resources,
to achieve our object
Resources?
-- Hey, Wally.
Let Ski not have died for nothing.
If we stop now,
Ski has died for nothing.
Cole, change the message in supplies.
Hose 76, hose 76, 92 beast on.
The morale is low, understandable
We must remain concentrated,
these men have been trained.
They would rather die than last
chosen for a mission.
Where's that damned heli?
-- No idea, he had already contacted state.
I hope that they are not shot,
on the other side of the valley,
where we ran in the fall.
-- That would kloten.
Wait, I hear him.
I hear nothing.
I have not imagined.
I see headlights.
At two hours.
It resembles a single vehicle.
And it is this side.
That's none of us,
who would no light at the time.
Hostile reinforcements presumably.
-- We must here.
Wait, they go out together.
-- What?
Did you do that.
What was that?
The Taliban have weapons.
Missiles maybe.
-- Whatever it was,
about an hour or two is the light,
We should work towards the other side of that mountain.
If we do, we find another
landingszone and ask where that bird is.
Come off.
They were down the lights, where Aban
it had when he contacted.
I knew now at least,
that we opgingen the right direction.
We had horses should take.
-- Since it is now too late.
Damn.
The engine is overheated.
These mountains make sure that he is ten times
to work harder than normal.
Stop here, he can cool down.
I open the bonnet,
he can ventilate.
How are we in time?
We must continue as we are opposed
the dark mountain like this.
Look, it's still a long way.
-- My kingdom for a few donkeys.
What has happened to him?
Have you seen anything?
We did not have to drive through the valley.
Our tracks are cleared.
-- What has happened to our reliable guide?
He's going to reisziek.
Chief, I do not have to deal with the satellite,
Mount creates interference.
I try after the pass again.
If this bitch still somewhere to go,
there must be water.
What has happened to the water?
Anderhalve jerrycan.
Twins zandstormen, unusually,
but not God's work.
There is, is the real enemy.
There is overshadowing the truth
and that we can not use now.
Our water is low.
What was over, the truck went,
So now our drinkflessen empty.
I thought no supplies will be needed,
but we have no other choice.
Hose 76, response, beast 92.
It must be that rock,
I receive nothing.
It will not be long,
the weather is good.
When should his wife gave birth?
I thought sometime in January.
What will he do?
A strange moment,
to look at stars.
Maybe he wants the home front
a full moon in Afghanistan show.
Hearing you do that?
These begin.
-- Let's go.
See you what, chief?
No, not yet.
He sounds close.
Seek him, Cole.
Departure 01, 01 departure,
92 beast, radiocontrole.
Departure 01, note, I send you bad.
-- It is somewhere behind that ridge.
He is there somewhere, I believe.
-- That's because those rocky walls.
Departure 01, watch out, you are indiscernible,
repeat your last message.
Damn.
I think it is a form
of interference.
It sounds,
as if he is above us.
KT, shooting a torch.
What happened?
Departure 01, departing 01, 92 beast.
He may not have crashed,
than we had flames seen or heard something.
Departure 01, departing 01, 92 beast,
everything is okay?
Damn.
Why are they on our frequency?
I do not know.
-- What they say?
Abdul, you understand this?
-- No, I do not know.
That does not matter,
heli who was in the right place.
Yes, but he disappeared.
-- We do not know.
We must continue.
We set up a camp, on the mountain.
I thought not. How should we
Ski's body take in the dark.
We do not. We cover his body
and come back tomorrow morning.
I do not know boss.
-- What would you do?
We can not continue to wait for the bus.
We need that mountain
and a defensible position search.
If we encounter those bastards again,
I want to shoot down.
The team is confused,
though they did not matter.
It makes no sense to talk,
about something that you can not control.
That is impossible chief.
I've never made a mistake.
-- Why tell them that we were not there?
I do not know,
I've checked those numbers three times.
Someone has made a mistake.
Godverdomme.
Men, come take a look.
Who had the first watch?
-- I.
Do you have something seen or heard?
-- No, nothing.
I had the second wait,
I have not heard or seen.
This is a big mess, chief.
-- Someone wants us to graze.
Ga to the verstopplek and search Skis body.
Be careful and come back as soon as possible.
KT, I want
that we leave as soon as possible.
Abdul, you know where to find water here?
Now is the time was ripe.
Because if we find nothing within 24 hours,
we are thick in trouble.
Cursed wanted.
Come.
Sydney, this is box.
Sydney to box.
Chief, KT.
What do you feel?
What do you think it is?
-- I have no idea.
I do not think we want to know,
what's behind door number one. Wegwezen.
I have the feeling,
that they knew that we came.
Keynes, come.
The longer I'm here, the more convinced
I am, that I do not think the nuclear disappeared.
A voice in my head waiting out
to say, I said it anyway.
Everyone is drinking,
store still has no meaning.
Where does that well?
With these two peaks as a reference,
I would say about ten, twelve miles.
I hope you certainly know Abdul.
-- I'm sure.
It is a small oasis.
The farmers will share their animals water,
the highlands before they withdraw.
Look.
My compass says that this is the north,
but then the sun in the war.
I suspect that we are a
large magnetic field.
Maybe by the iron in the rocks.
And the satelliettelefoon?
-- Nothing.
Pete, what have you on your GPS?
Nothing.
Abdul, it seems,
you're the ball.
Pete, you lead.
-- Okay.
We're going.
These men will not admit,
Abdul but is now the most valuable man.
We had just as good
on another planet.
See you move?
No.
-- Okay, we're going to check.
Chief, perhaps
a confrontation unwise.
We're going to kill terrorists,
everything else is detail.
Americans?
What he says?
I think, something that he is a warrior,
like you, but I can not do everything.
Kent Mohammed Aban he?
Thank him for the water.
We fill our veldflessen.
You see what he aanheeft under that mantle?
It seems a uniform. Of the Soviets?
No, British, of the 44 th regiment.
I wonder where he came.
-- The question is, when.
The 44 th regiment no longer exists.
The bones of hell. "
-- Where it all about?
In 1942 led the British
4500 man go here,
with women and children
and flight operators.
In 1944, according to legend
16000 people made the pass.
And only one came through it.
He said that he has borne witness,
a miracle of Satan.
It's just a legend.
Say you that this uniform on that unit?
I do not understand how it could be.
-- But the period is correct?
That's right.
I agree ga look deeper into the cave.
Aban talked about a guard,
would it be?
If so, whom he guarded?
Or what?
He sits in the middle of a 'hot' zone.
There is everywhere a low concentration of radiation.
He is in the vicinity,
I know that for sure.
The boys home,
want this fixed.
Griezelige mongrel.
Christ.
Contact.
Shit.
Jesus Cole, you blew him into the sky.
Cole, what happened?
I will attackers.
Five, maybe six.
He seemed to talk with them here.
With their swords and pyjamas,
it seemed to wonder whether they came.
Cole, tell me exactly what you saw.
-- I could see them with my night.
He spoke with that group
and they were armed, I swear it.
We can now do nothing.
He will have allies,
we have come here for that.
Let's go.
Cole bowl.
You will not believe me anyway very much, eh?
-- Yes.
What are you doing now?
You can not let him.
Keynes, that rule.
Abdul we have here.
It is too dangerous.
How could you do that?
You Americans killed him for nothing.
That we are not wanted,
it was an accident.
You have buried him,
Otherwise, the accident.
Abdul, listen, we must go
there may be enemies in the vicinity.
Please, come along.
There is an uncertain silence cases
on the group, since we opbraken.
It is difficult to determine,
they are more worried,
about what Cole did,
or about what he saw.
Hey Pete, five-minute break.
Stitch, my stomach is upset.
Wipe off your face.
You're dehydrated.
Drink this.
-- Do not worry.
What do you do well, it's not funny.
-- I have not done.
I am filled with water last night.
-- Damn, man.
What happens here?
We have them refilled.
I tell you, that we are cursed.
-- Abdul bring us to the oasis.
Nobody would like to admit,
ie that might lose control.
But it is still difficult,
if you happen to everybody sees.
Damn, this thing is worthless.
He does not even looking.
He is the kloten,
above, you should get a signal.
Is the battery destroyed?
There is something wrong.
-- What's Abdul?
This is wrong.
This valley I remember not.
Make no jokes Abdul.
You said a source here.
Yes, but the path has changed.
What about now?
Abdul has been lost.
-- Why not surprise me.
This is the peak,
then we are here.
I can agree.
Where is there than that?
State he was not on the map?
-- It is perhaps not 100%.
But I do not believe,
that a whole piece of land they have missed.
I do not know.
I'm sorry.
You do not have him
pre-paid Keynes eh?
He is the forgotten.
-- Yes, but we still pay him as a guide?
Chief, perhaps the sunspots,
or a kind of interference.
That can take two days.
-- Sunspot do not sand in veldflessen.
Well, we need somewhere
Find a place to rest.
During walking is not good.
Let's go.
Maybe this is really necessary.
Completely lost touch
before you find what you are looking for.
Is it, buddy?
-- No, man.
It feels as if something
from inside eats at me.
Can you give me my pills,
they sit front of my backpack.
This?
Do you think we are cursed?
Not smoking if you do not have water.
-- Adjust but, di's a 'waterzoek' cigar.
What are you doing,
movie you our downfall Keynes?
What do you mean sergeant,
you intend to stay here to die?
No soldier plant his death.
It is what, in this godverlaten resort,
to work for the CIA.
What is really our goal,
Keynes agent?
Or should I say,
what was our goal?
I am referring to the briefing explained.
Okay, so highly secret.
It must be very secret,
the CIA wants one of his own people send.
Usually you call it will pass through
and we support your back,
Cleaning up the mess?
I recognize covert operations.
So what the real mission is,
let it worth it.
You do not know what I'm with you, if I discover
Ski that died for your salary.
He died for his country and not for me.
McCarthy, calm to size,
we are all in the same boat.
How do you find that you can always
on the support of an Aussie.
Wake up.
Ga of myself.
He dreams.
Is everything okay?
Ga.
They called again.
-- Really?
Yes, I'm okay.
-- Cole, care for him.
Have you dysentery?
-- No, I had already ondergescheten.
If you have something to add,
it is now time for this.
I'm just as thirsty as you chief.
Perhaps it is this cursed place.
Find coverage.
Loop.
What's that on?
Too high for a truck.
-- Too quiet for a helicopter.
Where does he go?
I see no enemies. Take Cole mee
and see what is going on.
Ok.
Pete, ensure coverage in the back.
-- Okay, understood.
Please note.
Now.
Stop with fire.
Everyone remains in coverage.
Did you Chief?
That voice in my head was there again
and now was more important
than all the documents together.
The bones of hell '
was the story of one man.
But we will find evidence.
-- Chief.
Look.
-- Jesus is that all that's left?
What do you think it was?
-- I'm not sure.
Certainly something,
that we have never seen.
The Taliban have no such thing,
perhaps the Soviets, something experimental.
Chief, we need here.
The camp reopening,
they come back down.
If we do not quickly find water,
it makes no difference.
Hey.
-- Hello.
We must continue. Can you walk?
-- Yes, it does so.
From him I do not know.
-- Abdul, we should go.
Damn.
Have you not heard me Abdul?
I said that we leave.
We will die,
my grandfather was right.
We never had to come from.
-- Since it is now too late.
Pack your belongings and ga.
-- I ga not with you.
Do not be dumb Abdul, if you leave us,
you will die.
We are already dead.
-- I am here spuugzat.
So you might think,
but I do not want in my team.
What is happening?
-- I spoke with your husband, Keynes.
He said ...
-- Abdul, no.
Wacky bastard.
He did not much for us.
-- We had him.
What? He led us ...
-- I tell you, we had him.
Certainly not to find water.
Or perhaps Aban?
There is more.
Tell us damn,
what that means more?
I tell only what you need to know, chief.
-- Make a joke.
Who is there now know more than we do?
He bastard, I lost all three men
during this damned quest of you.
And now let me know what this is all about.
Tell us what is going on.
What was that thing last night.
We do not know.
-- We?
You and those lulletjes in Langley?
-- Listen ... Chief,
all I can say is that I work
for a special department within the CIA.
Wonderful as that.
We are here to die,
while you are on spokenjacht?
I personally shoot a bullet in you.
We have orders to follow chief.
-- Perhaps you know it yet,
but dead men do not follow orders.
I want to tell them,
I realize that I must tell.
In my head I browse all protocols,
all secrets
and wonder, what is the point of
death to go, that everything in my head?
What will they do,
with the information I send them?
Mohammed Aban know.
He knew the whole time.
But he still alive?
Keynes, what is there?
What is there, you saw something?
I saw Mohammed Aban.
-- Do you love me for a ride?
Look.
What's that damn thing for?
-- No idea.
But I think that this is your chief men killed.
Here I was looking for.
That is why I am here.
I do not, it is a weapon?
-- We do not know.
Something of the Soviets?
We can not fight against,
if you do not say what it is.
Okay, sergeant.
Get your men.
How long do you know this already?
Since the tachtigerjaren,
when we Moedjahadin trained.
We tried to use this area,
to trainingkampen there.
But we discovered,
that everything here was dead.
What do you mean by death?
-- Nothing worked.
Radios, compasses, nothing that
with electromagnetic radiation.
So my group began an investigation.
In 2000 we saw something,
an image.
A satellite image.
-- What you saw?
Have you ever heard of the Vimanas?
-- No, never.
I very much, they occur in the Asian foklore,
in particular in India.
A kind of UFO, but then triangular.
Alexander the Great wrote,
that his troops attacked them.
He called them "flying shields."
-- So this is a damned UFO hunt.
No chief, it was identified.
There is evidence.
We believe that it is a weapon,
with unprecedented force.
And why were you and your men selected.
What does it matter if we find that thing
while dying?
Not just research, eh?
Listen, this is my connection
with the outside world.
Your camera?
What are you talking about Keynes?
I have forwarded optical images,
laserverbinding through this.
Great.
-- And that you tell us now pas?
So your people follow us all the time al
They know where we are today.
This is the only way,
to collect irrefutable evidence.
We did not know,
whether anyone would return.
This is insane.
-- This is a damned suicidal.
There is a huge difference,
between suicide and sacrifice.
Precisely, this is the difference,
you bastard.
This is larger than ourselves together,
So calm.
I would suggest you should neerknallen,
for what you aandeed my men.
Your men were patriots chief.
-- Those were my friends.
I understand that.
That is enough.
So do not go chief.
I'm not the enemy.
That would be just as well you can.
I'm sorry sergeant.
I am prepared to die for my country,
but this ...
I do not know whether this is life or death.
Maybe there is something in between.
Keynes is awake.
-- What is happening?
The Chief is gone.
-- How long already?
No idea, he left his gun behind,
I do not know why.
We must adopt
that he did not return.
What's new with Degetau?
-- Not very well.
Can you do not pass through your connection,
that they should come and collect him?
They will not come.
-- Look at him.
He is not useful for the mission.
-- We are the mission, sergeant.
See you do not,
Our goal is to find the Vimanas,
their goal is to see what happens,
if we succeed.
The end justifies the means.
-- That is the problem, eh?
We seem never to reach the end.
We must continue.
Is that what I think it is?
-- They are the bones of hell. "
Unbelievable.
It seems that we are in hell.
-- Near in any case.
I have no doubt that this is the
print, which we saw from space.
The fate of humanity,
displayed here for us.
Is this a message, a warning?
Am I the messenger?
What is happening?
-- Watch.
My God.
They are the.
My God, get me here.
How should we fight against something?
Then we do not.
I must go, okay?
For it is too dark.
Are you too late for a meeting?
Klootzak.
I can not bear.
-- Then you had better go.
You're a good soldier.
Your country will be proud.
My country will never know who I am.
Goodbye.
Something tells me that I should proceed.
In order to search for water, or anything else.
I'm really not anymore.
I seem to know the direction,
but not the destination.
Am I being led, or is it a tragic
to attempt to die with dignity.
Is there any dignity?
Ga to your God, as a soldier.
It will save us all.
Stacey Okay, let's get started,
when your man departed.
Can you tell us something about his mission?
It is almost a year,
in november.
He did not speak much about his mission,
because he works for the CIA.
But I know he was in Afghanistan
and a special someone was looking for.
Your husband worked in a special group
within the CIA, is that correct?
Yes, that's what he told me.
You know whether there is still more of that group
disappeared?
I know that he would take a team
and that they would help him
Mohammed search,
but I do not know who they are.
Nobody seems to know something.
I do not,
they can still remember him?
He devoted his life to his country.
That diary you have there,
is that the only evidence from that period?
It was me a few weeks
After his departure sent.
I know it is him.
I recognize his handwriting, despite the codes.
I just want to know whether he is still alive.
