1
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,382
Emily!

2
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,713
You're the medical examiner?

3
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,566
Mr. Rose?

4
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,765
I'm sorry, Mr. Rose...

5
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,405
...but I cannot state conclusively...

6
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:39,544
...that the cause of death
was natural.

7
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,978
Your daughter, she...

8
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,321
Excuse me, Father?

9
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,031
Father Moore.

10
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,733
You'll have to come with me.

11
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,681
- Father Moore!
- Will you plead guilty?

12
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,443
- Tell us about the exorcism!
- Over here, Father Moore!

13
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,849
We're at Crescent County Courthouse.
We show you Father Richard Moore...

14
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,684
- What about the parents?
- They're not talking to the police.

15
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,018
Do we charge them?

16
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,421
No. Even the priest admits
he ran the show.

17
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,256
We need a Christian on this.

18
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,658
Preferably a Catholic.

19
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,924
Somebody that knows this shit
inside out...

20
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,103
...and who the public will see
as unbiased.

21
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,369
We're going after a holy man here.

22
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,235
Ethan Thomas.

23
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,873
He's not Catholic, though.
Methodist, I think.

24
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,540
But the guy practically lives at church.
Choir, teaches Sunday school.

25
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,880
He's no choirboy in the courtroom.
I've seen him tear people up.

26
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,190
He's a shrewd son of a bitch.

27
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,792
All right, pull him off whatever
he's doing. He's lead prosecutor.

28
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,485
There's ambition. She never stops.
She even works while she drinks.

29
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,681
- Gentlemen, you know Erin Bruner.
- Of course.

30
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,156
- Hello.
- I was so sure Van Hopper would fry...

31
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,091
...but you proved me wrong, lady.

32
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,594
The system worked, that's all.

33
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,524
Gentlemen, you'll excuse us,
will you?

34
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,799
Have you seen the news
about this priest?

35
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,634
I heard something about an exorcism
gone bad, but I don't know the details.

36
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,242
The DA charged him
with negligent homicide.

37
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,846
They offered a very reasonable plea
bargain, but the priest turned it down.

38
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,242
Do not ask me to take this...

39
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,681
The archdiocese
specifically requested you.

40
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,482
- Why me?
- They followed the Van Hopper trial.

41
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,282
They think you're smart...

42
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:07,891
...and convincing.

43
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,554
They want you to ask the priest
to reconsider.

44
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,957
Well, what if he won't?

45
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,100
This sounds like a quagmire.
If I'm smart, I'll leave it alone.

46
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,398
Erin, the Van Hopper case
got you back on the fast track.

47
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,596
Once again, you're a rising star.

48
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,369
- Chivas, neat, please.
- Tanqueray martini, dry.

49
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,914
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, you do this for me...

50
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,112
...and the rising star keeps rising.

51
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,546
The case is yours.

52
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,256
And just how high
do I get to rise this time?

53
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,825
I've been junior partner
for too long now, Karl.

54
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,191
- It's not like other firms haven't called.
- Erin...

55
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,267
I want my name on the door,
right next to yours.

56
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,831
Okay.

57
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,235
Try to get the deal.

58
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,633
If the priest won't
and this goes to trial...

59
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,313
...the archdiocese feels he could
be an embarrassment.

60
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,414
So under no circumstances
is he to testify.

61
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,982
No, of course.
If I'd put Van Hopper on the stand...

62
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:10,178
...he'd be marking time on death row
instead of sunbathing in Miami.

63
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,754
His tab.

64
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,347
Good morning, I'm Erin Bruner.

65
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,977
May I sit down?

66
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,056
They brought the chair
for my public defender.

67
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:53,021
I guess they left it when they decided
I wasn't going to kill myself with it.

68
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,608
My firm represents the archdiocese.

69
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,609
Yes.

70
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,277
Yes, I was expecting them
to send someone.

71
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,048
- Why did they choose you?
- I wanted this case.

72
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,690
- So you like the spotlight?
- I'm used to it.

73
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,415
I defended James Van Hopper.

74
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,052
And now you've come
to further your celebrity.

75
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,490
No.

76
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,822
I'm here to make senior partner
at my firm.

77
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,599
- Are you a Catholic?
- No.

78
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,105
I'm an agnostic, I guess.
I'm not really sure.

79
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,107
If you're not sure, then you are one.

80
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,740
I don't think you're the right attorney.
I'll stick with my public defender.

81
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,419
He can't get the DA
to get you a better deal. I can.

82
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,451
I won't be making
any plea agreement.

83
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,919
If you don't, the archdiocese
won't post your bail.

84
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,183
You'll be stuck in here for the trial.

85
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,359
Do you understand how long
they can put you away?

86
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:00,759
It's been explained to me.

87
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,403
The DA's office doesn't like it when
religion holds itself above the law.

88
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,162
And this prosecutor,
Ethan Thomas?

89
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,170
You're gonna need somebody
hungry and smart...

90
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,138
...and aggressive
to even have a chance.

91
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,871
What would your strategy be to defend
me against such a formidable man?

92
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,509
- That depends.
- On what?

93
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,048
On how you wanna be defended.

94
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:27,224
What's your main concern,
other than staying out of jail?

95
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,884
- Is it how you're being portrayed?
- I don't care about my reputation.

96
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,928
I'm not afraid of jail.

97
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,801
What I care about
is telling Emily Rose's story.

98
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,440
I want people to hear
what only I can tell.

99
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,303
And what is that?

100
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,068
What really happened to Emily...

101
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,178
...and why.

102
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,812
If I let you defend me...

103
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,013
...will you promise to let me testify and
tell the truth about what happened?

104
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:03,352
And what is the truth you would tell?
That the ritual killed her?

105
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,022
- Was it your fault she died?
- No.

106
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,291
All right.
Then I'll let you tell her story.

107
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,198
But only if you agree to let me do
whatever else it takes to win.

108
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,049
You're not used to
this kind of place.

109
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,523
I'm sure our life is very strange
to you.

110
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,257
Not so strange.

111
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,902
I grew up in a little town.

112
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,869
But our house wasn't as nice
or as big as this.

113
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,043
My mother, she raised me alone.

114
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,110
She was a schoolteacher,
so we had very little money.

115
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,543
What a wonderful thing to be.

116
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,341
That was Emily's dream,
to be a teacher.

117
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,221
That's why she went away
to the university.

118
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,656
A lot of cats live here.

119
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,261
There are...

120
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,132
...11 now, I think.

121
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,829
Emily always brought them home.

122
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,808
Ever since she was a little girl,
she couldn't leave a stray abandoned.

123
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,915
Before these troubles began...

124
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,450
...was Emily a happy girl?

125
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,611
Oh, yes.

126
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,047
Before she went away
to university...

127
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,057
...my Emily was so very happy.

128
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,066
What is going on...? Girls!

129
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,034
Mama.

130
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,507
Is it...?

131
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,309
It's a scholarship, Mama.

132
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,476
They pay for it.
They pay for everything.

133
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,950
This is your dream, Emily.

134
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,716
You'll be leaving us.

135
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,818
It's okay.

136
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,825
I'll be okay.

137
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,964
I'm gonna show this to your father.

138
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,474
- Counselor. Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.

139
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,879
Can I buy you a drink, Mr. Thomas?
He makes an excellent martini.

140
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,981
Just water for me, please.

141
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,983
So...

142
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,984
...the judge thinks we should offer
a new plea agreement.

143
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,323
She feels the community might be
better served without this trial.

144
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,653
How do you feel about it?

145
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,523
Personally.

146
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,598
My job is to represent
the interests of the people...

147
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,461
...and make an effort to be objective.

148
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,735
I ask because I know
you're a churchgoer.

149
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,703
Now you're set to prosecute
a man of God.

150
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,209
Your priest broke the law...

151
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,436
...and a young girl is dead.

152
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,577
If he's a man of God, then, personally,
I think he's even more subject...

153
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,379
...to the laws of moral behavior.
If it were up to me, he'd get no deal.

154
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:19,319
And forgiveness and compassion?
Isn't that part of your creed?

155
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,493
Or does that just get in the way
of your work?

156
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,058
If you have compassion
for your client...

157
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,564
...you'll persuade him to accept this:

158
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,066
Charges reduced
to reckless endangerment.

159
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,364
Twelve months in a county jail.

160
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,973
Reducible to six, plus probation,
if he stays out of trouble.

161
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,837
Somehow I expect
he can manage that.

162
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,044
But please understand me.
If he refuses, I will seek the maximum.

163
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,279
Father Moore has made it clear
there will be no plea agreement.

164
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,249
He will not lie or admit to something
he is not guilty of.

165
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,947
- And he was never neglectful of Emily.
- "Never neglectful"?

166
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,921
Have you seen
the postmortem photographs?

167
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:03,095
We'll go to trial. My client wants
the public to know the truth.

168
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,563
Good.

169
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,503
So do I.

170
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,234
Have a good night, counselor.

171
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,276
Let the record show that the defendant
and his counsel are present...

172
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,145
...and that the jury is seated.

173
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,484
- Mr. Thomas, you may begin.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

174
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,750
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Ethan Thomas.

175
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,361
I'm the assistant district attorney,
and I represent the people.

176
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,964
In the case before you,
the evidence will show...

177
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,830
...that the victim had a serious medical
condition that demanded treatment.

178
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:50,236
We will prove that the victim's
condition rendered her physically...

179
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:55,402
...and psychologically incapable
of caring for herself.

180
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,104
Her care...

181
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,011
...was then wholly entrusted...

182
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:03,385
...to that man, the defendant,
Father Richard Moore.

183
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,183
She became his responsibility...

184
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,025
...and he betrayed
that responsibility...

185
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,720
...by persuading her to abandon
her medical treatment...

186
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,422
...in favor of religious treatment:

187
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,763
A ritual exorcism,
performed by the defendant...

188
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:24,909
...allegedly to cure the victim
by ridding her of demonic forces.

189
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:29,206
We will demonstrate
that this course of action...

190
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,350
...directly resulted
in the victim's death.

191
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,480
I said a moment ago
that I represent the people.

192
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,713
We all know what that means,
but it's a little abstract, isn't it?

193
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,419
Miss Bruner,
the attorney for the defense...

194
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,460
...is seated right next
to the man she represents.

195
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,962
And I stand here
to represent the people.

196
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,402
That's not really why
I stand here today.

197
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,096
I'm here on behalf of someone
who can't sit at a table...

198
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,540
...and look at you every day
and gain your sympathy...

199
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,943
...someone who can't take the stand
to testify...

200
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,482
...and tell you what happened
in her own words.

201
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,289
A young girl...

202
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,424
...that could've been your daughter.

203
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,920
Could've been mine.

204
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:20,030
A girl who trusted
Father Richard Moore with her life.

205
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,303
This is what she looked like...

206
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:35,877
...before the defendant began
his religious treatment.

207
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,216
This is a photograph taken of her
on the day that she died.

208
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:00,602
I stand here for Emily Rose...

209
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,672
...who died horribly...

210
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,906
...at age 19.

211
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,511
You won't be able to see Emily sitting
here day after day during this trial.

212
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,783
But I hope you'll remember her
as she was when she was alive...

213
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,147
...and full of...

214
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,357
...hopes and dreams.

215
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,233
And as she was when Father
Richard Moore was finished with her...

216
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,993
...and left her to die.

217
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,003
Thank you.

218
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:42,208
Is the defense prepared
to make its opening statement?

219
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,243
I'd like to reserve
my opening statement...

220
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,682
...until the presentation
of the defense's case.

221
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,651
As is your privilege.

222
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,521
Prosecution may begin.

223
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,193
That was already my plan.

224
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,886
Thank you, Your Honor.
The people call Dr. Edith Vogel.

225
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:03,830
I've known Emily her entire life.
I took care of all of the Rose girls.

226
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,062
Can you describe Emily
as you knew her growing up?

227
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,604
She was a bit sickly
in her early years.

228
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:14,404
She stayed inside a lot,
reading, learning music.

229
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,608
How did she feel about
going to school?

230
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,783
Objection.
The witness is not a psychiatrist.

231
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,112
I'll rephrase. Did you talk to Emily
about going off to college?

232
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,812
Yes. She told me she was excited...

233
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:29,483
...but nervous that she would be away
from her family in the big city.

234
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,686
This was an overwhelming change
for her.

235
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,728
Did you stay in touch
after she went away?

236
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:39,336
Yes. She wrote me a letter
saying that she'd been to a dance...

237
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,563
...and she'd met a boy
named Jason.

238
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,839
She didn't want her mother
to know this...

239
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,533
...because her mother did not
approve of dancing...

240
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,804
...and had warned her
about the boys at school.

241
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,745
Did Emily communicate with you again
last fall after you received the letter?

242
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,543
Actually, it was her mother.

243
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,647
She telephoned me...

244
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,451
...waking me out of a deep sleep
at 4 in the morning.

245
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:07,262
She asked me to call Emily at
a payphone on the university campus.

246
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,365
When Emily answered,
she was quite hysterical.

247
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,971
At first, she just
sobbed uncontrollably.

248
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,202
But eventually she calmed down
enough to tell me what happened.

249
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,674
She said that she was alone
that weekend.

250
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,410
Her roommate had gone home.

251
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,483
She had awakened...

252
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,430
...and thought she smelled
something burning.

253
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,059
There was no alarm,
but she got up...

254
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,030
...afraid there was a fire.

255
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,185
Dr. Mueller, what's your position
at the university hospital?

256
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,019
I am chairman of
the Department of Neurology.

257
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,492
And after you heard
about the dorm-room incident...

258
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,255
...what were your initial thoughts?

259
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:03,559
At first, I thought perhaps
Emily had taken illegal drugs.

260
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,565
Some type of hallucinogen.

261
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,604
But we ran tests and found no trace
of drugs in her system.

262
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,038
And the more she explained
the incident to me...

263
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,441
...the more I began to suspect
something else.

264
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:20,107
Epilepsy results from uncontrolled
electrical activity in the brain.

265
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,020
In a severe, or grand mal, seizure...

266
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,712
...a person may lose consciousness
for several minutes...

267
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:29,257
...and suffer involuntary contractions
of all the muscles of the body.

268
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,861
Is it possible for a person
suffering such a seizure...

269
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:35,362
...to have hallucinations or perceive
the things that Emily described?

270
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:39,059
The muscle contractions could feel
like an extreme pressure on the body.

271
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,104
And it is certainly possible,
with all that brain activity...

272
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:46,539
...for a person to perceive all sorts
of strange and violent things.

273
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,277
So suspecting that Emily was
epileptic, how did you proceed?

274
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,677
I administered
an electroencephalograph.

275
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,078
What did the EEG reveal?

276
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:58,723
It showed a possible epileptic focus
in the patient's left temporal lobe.

277
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,687
Did this require
a specific treatment?

278
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,020
Yes, I began a medication schedule
for Emily with the drug Gambutrol.

279
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,256
I also advised regular follow-up
examinations and further tests.

280
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,435
But Emily failed to keep
her follow-up appointments with me.

281
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,697
She give any reason for discontinuing
these appointments?

282
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,569
Yes, she told me she was convinced
that her condition was a spiritual one.

283
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:23,043
It was the conviction of her priest,
she said, and she shared his beliefs.

284
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,808
Was it your impression
that Emily had placed her care...

285
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,882
...entirely...?
- Leading the witness.

286
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,514
Sustained.

287
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,680
After the end of October...

288
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,190
...did you ask Emily
why she had stopped...

289
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,055
...filling her Gambutrol
prescriptions?

290
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,666
Yes. She said that Father Moore had
suggested she stop taking the drug.

291
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,494
And what, in your medical opinion...

292
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,898
...was the result
of Father Moore's suggestion?

293
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,232
I believe Father Moore's suggestion
killed her.

294
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,806
Objection, Your Honor!

295
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,308
The witness is asserting outrageous
conclusions based on pure hearsay.

296
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:59,642
Technically correct, but I'll allow it
as part of his expert opinion testimony.

297
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,580
Thank you, Dr. Mueller.

298
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,980
Your witness.

299
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:08,182
You said you observed a possible
epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.

300
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,988
Doesn't this imply what you observed
may not have been an epileptic focus?

301
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,789
Yes, that's also possible.

302
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,127
Would Father Moore's advice to stop
taking Gambutrol be good advice...

303
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,235
...if Emily were, in fact,
not epileptic?

304
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,599
Of course. But that's not
the case here. She was epileptic.

305
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,303
Really.

306
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,104
When Emily saw objects move
on their own...

307
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,111
...and felt an invisible presence
on top of her...

308
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,807
...was she experiencing symptoms
typical of epilepsy?

309
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,213
Not typical, no.

310
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,048
Are they typical indications
of any other conditions?

311
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,316
- Say, for example, psychosis?
- Yes, I would say that's correct.

312
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,023
But isn't psychosis an entirely different
medical condition from epilepsy?

313
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,396
- Yes, in my...
- So aren't you selectively choosing...

314
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,570
...what parts of Emily's experiences
fit your epilepsy diagnosis...

315
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,001
...while ignoring those which
indicate something else?

316
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,572
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Withdrawn.

317
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,344
No further questions.

318
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,170
We have to work fast.

319
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,712
They're only giving me an hour
with you tonight.

320
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,512
Listen.

321
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,785
Before we get started,
there's something I have to tell you...

322
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:47,082
...something I should've said to you
before I let you take the case.

323
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,623
Okay.

324
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,896
There are forces
surrounding this trial.

325
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,761
Dark, powerful forces.

326
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:03,467
Just be careful, Erin.
Watch your step.

327
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,537
I see.

328
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,147
Look...

329
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,583
Father, you don't have to worry
about me.

330
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,218
I'm an agnostic, remember?

331
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,984
Demons exist,
whether you believe in them or not.

332
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:22,555
Your involvement in this trial might
just open you up to their attacks.

333
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,687
Look, Father,
I appreciate your concern...

334
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,128
...but you need to be worried
about yourself.

335
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,633
Ethan Thomas is using the medical
aspects of this case as ammunition...

336
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:36,637
...and I have to be prepared
for his attacks, so...

337
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:42,575
...with what little time we have, I think
we need to focus on your defense.

338
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:58,355
Now, what I need from you is more
information about Emily's condition.

339
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,556
Specific details of how it progressed
after the dorm-room episode.

340
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,826
Well, after the first incident...

341
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:10,941
...she was sent to the university
hospital for testing and observation.

342
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:50,847
Emily once told me that in her
dorm room, she resisted the demons...

343
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,847
...but at the hospital
they overcame her.

344
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,683
So she believed...

345
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,014
...that her possession
began at the hospital?

346
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,082
Yeah, I think she did.

347
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,228
And after that, things just went
from bad to worse.

348
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,287
Emily!

349
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:50,992
Emily?

350
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,550
Oh, my God. Emily?

351
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,621
Don't touch me.

352
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:37,366
Jason, please...

353
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,809
...don't leave me.

354
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,677
And I never did leave her.

355
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,446
I stayed until the end.

356
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:58,361
So much of what we shared
was like a nightmare...

357
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,498
...but I wouldn't give up
a single minute I spent with her.

358
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,136
She woke me up, you know?

359
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:10,831
To things I never felt before,
things I never knew I could feel.

360
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,311
I never knew how dead I was
until I met her.

361
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:23,654
- Residential north metro district
where James Van Hopper...

362
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,119
...acquitted after
a controversial trial...

363
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:29,088
- Can you turn that up, please?
...has apparently struck again.

364
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,124
It was inside
this quiet suburban home...

365
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,924
...that police say James Van Hopper
murdered a young couple today.

366
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,829
Sources close to the investigation
say that Van Hopper...

367
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,265
...who was acquitted
of murder charges in April...

368
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,405
...may have known
both of the victims.

369
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:46,566
Their names are being withheld
pending family notification.

370
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,592
Most glorious prince
of the heavenly army...

371
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,736
...holy Michael, the archangel...

372
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,201
...defend us in battle
against the princes...

373
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,806
...powers and rulers of darkness.

374
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:09,292
Counsel Bruner, my courtroom day
begins at 9:30 a.m.

375
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,436
- I'm sorry, Your Honor, l...
- Which was 17 minutes ago.

376
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,030
Ready to proceed?

377
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,540
Yes, Your Honor.

378
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,303
Dr. Briggs, please state
your qualifications for the court.

379
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,674
I have advanced degrees
in medicine...

380
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,783
...psychiatry and neurology
from Johns Hopkins...

381
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:32,081
...and I have had three books
and several dozen papers published...

382
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:35,156
...in the fields of neurology
and neuropsychiatry.

383
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,385
What was the cause of death,
as determined by the autopsy?

384
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:42,930
The decedent expired due to a gradual
shutdown of the bodily functions.

385
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,998
Why did her body shut down?

386
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,137
The autopsy found
that it was a cumulative effect...

387
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,968
...from numerous physical traumas
exacerbated by malnutrition...

388
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:57,045
...which severely inhibited her ability
to recuperate from those traumas.

389
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:01,685
In other words, her starving body
had little or no means to recover...

390
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:05,822
...from the injuries it was sustaining,
and so it eventually just gave out.

391
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,650
How did Emily get these injuries?

392
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,656
Some were the result
of violent epileptic seizures...

393
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,488
...and some were self-inflicted.

394
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,392
And why, in your opinion,
did Emily injure herself...

395
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,032
...and why did she stop eating?

396
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,397
Upon review
of her complete medical file...

397
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,095
...I concluded that Emily's epilepsy
had evolved...

398
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,765
...into a condition known as
psychotic epileptic disorder.

399
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,740
This is a rare development,
to be sure...

400
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,312
...but one that I have witnessed
numerous times.

401
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:35,281
- Emily was epileptic and psychotic?
- Yes.

402
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,944
Explain how this psychotic epileptic
disorder would manifest itself.

403
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,954
The seizures would have
the symptoms of schizophrenia...

404
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,526
...such as auditory
and visual hallucinations...

405
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,198
...and sometimes extreme paranoia.

406
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,630
The seizures may lock up the joints
and slightly contort the body.

407
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,827
The pupils will dilate,
making the eyes appear black.

408
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,836
So you believe
that Emily had epilepsy...

409
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,805
...which developed into
a form of violent psychosis...

410
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,308
...a condition that can be controlled
with Gambutrol?

411
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:05,949
Yes. And it would've been,
if she'd continued her treatment.

412
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,914
In your opinion, if Emily
had continued with her medication...

413
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,587
...would she be alive today?
- Absolutely.

414
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:17,159
If treated early, psychotic epileptic
disorder is rarely fatal.

415
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,953
I mean, this...

416
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:22,496
This was a very sick girl.

417
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,358
The defendant should've realized
that Emily was in need...

418
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,265
...of continued medical treatment.

419
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:32,107
Thank you, doctor. Your witness.

420
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,072
Doctor, you testified that Gambutrol
could've controlled Emily's condition.

421
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,011
How do you know that?

422
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,779
It's the inevitable result
of taking the drug.

423
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,854
It would've controlled
her seizures...

424
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,048
...which were the root cause
of her psychosis.

425
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:52,194
But wasn't Emily still experiencing
psychotic symptoms...

426
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,489
...even after she started
taking the medication?

427
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,565
Yes. Because Gambutrol
has a cumulative effect.

428
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,827
It takes time to build up
in the system.

429
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:03,404
You assume that Gambutrol would've
helped her, but you don't know.

430
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,837
It's a reasonable assumption, but...

431
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,934
No, of course, I can't be certain.

432
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:14,916
Doctor, is "psychotic epileptic
disorder" a common medical term...

433
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,677
...or did you just make it up?

434
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,956
Well, I distinguished
and named the...

435
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,524
So psychotic epileptic disorder
is really your own pet theory?

436
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,388
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Sustained.

437
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:29,498
When Emily chose
to stop her medical treatment...

438
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,725
...what do you think
should've been done?

439
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,630
Upon recognizing her condition...

440
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,000
...I would have tranquilized her
and force-fed her.

441
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,504
And then, if necessary...

442
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,200
...I would've treated her
with electroconvulsive therapy.

443
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:44,313
Electroshock treatment. You would've
done this against her will?

444
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,514
To save her life?

445
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,418
Absolutely.

446
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,665
Nothing further.

447
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,001
The witness may step down.

448
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,070
Your Honor, I offer into evidence this
photograph as People's Exhibit 3-A.

449
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,904
And having done so,
the people rest.

450
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,046
The photograph is entered
into evidence.

451
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:22,184
We are recessed until
tomorrow morning, 9:30 sharp...

452
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,253
...at which time the defense
will give its opening statement...

453
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,117
...and call its first witness.

454
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,459
I'm sorry I was late.

455
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:34,119
I didn't get a lot of sleep. Big power
outage knocked out my alarm clock.

456
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,595
- It won't happen again.
- No, I didn't sleep either.

457
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,632
What kept you awake?

458
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,170
Doesn't matter.

459
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,900
You're under attack.

460
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,067
What are you talking about?

461
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,378
You're in a spiritual battle, Erin.

462
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,745
The forces of darkness are trying
to keep you away from the light.

463
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,853
Don't let them.

464
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:02,215
Don't worry about today.
We're doing fine.

465
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,486
We're getting creamed.
I can't believe I walked right into that.

466
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,860
Look, if we don't find a doctor
to testify that Emily...

467
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:15,300
...wasn't epileptic or schizophrenic
or schizo-epileptic, we're gonna lose.

468
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:26,639
Care of the city's main branch
and the university library...

469
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,045
...I bring you another dozen
fun-filled books...

470
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,620
...about the demonic
and the mentally deranged.

471
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,515
They burned women at the stake...

472
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,785
...during witch hunts
for being possessed.

473
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,792
Glad you don't have to defend
those guys.

474
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,397
- How are we on our medical experts?
- Not good.

475
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,796
The psychiatrist you wanted
is tied up in another trial.

476
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:49,905
And the neurologist is sailing
to Costa Rica.

477
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,335
This book I'm reading,
it's by an anthropologist.

478
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,675
It's about contemporary cases of
possession, mostly in the Third World.

479
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,144
People there are still
primitive and superstitious.

480
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,714
Maybe.

481
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,546
Maybe they see possession
for what it really is.

482
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,619
Maybe we've taught ourselves
not to see it.

483
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,785
- You saying you believe in this stuff?
- No.

484
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,292
Maybe we shouldn't just try
to invalidate the prosecution's case...

485
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,057
...by punching holes
in the medical approach.

486
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:20,703
Maybe we should also try
to validate the alternative.

487
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:28,244
- Validate possession in a court of law?
- Yes.

488
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,339
Okay. I guess we could bring in
some priests to talk about exorcisms...

489
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,781
No, the archdiocese
won't let us do that.

490
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:40,320
They wanna limit the Church's
exposure to Father Moore.

491
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,425
I've got three articles by the
anthropologist who wrote this book.

492
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,595
She approaches
the subject of possession...

493
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:49,197
...from a scientific perspective
and doesn't try to debunk it.

494
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,197
- You want me to track her down?
- Yeah.

495
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,598
Keep looking for a medical expert
to refute Dr. Briggs.

496
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,537
But send the case file
to this Dr. Sadira Adani.

497
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,472
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

498
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,240
...as you know by now,
my name is Erin Bruner...

499
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,577
...and I represent the defendant,
Richard Moore.

500
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,886
Mr. Thomas has contended
that Emily Rose suffered...

501
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,024
...from a serious medical condition...

502
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,626
...that required medical treatment,
nothing more.

503
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,491
He has asserted that any attempt
by my client...

504
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,758
...to help Emily by anything
other than medical means...

505
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:28,802
...was not only inappropriate,
but criminally negligent.

506
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,037
I'm now gonna ask
that you keep an open mind...

507
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,508
...to what our evidence
and testimony will show.

508
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:39,648
Medical treatment was not
the answer for Emily...

509
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,479
...because she simply did not suffer
from a medical condition.

510
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:48,181
She was neither epileptic
nor psychotic.

511
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:54,623
Emily Rose's condition, in fact,
was demonic possession.

512
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:58,323
An exorcism was her only hope
for a cure.

513
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:02,494
Some of you may find yourself unable
to reconcile Emily's beliefs...

514
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,004
...or those of the defendant
with your own.

515
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:09,338
You may not believe demons exist.
You won't have to.

516
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:13,340
Because you will see that after the
utter failure of doctors to help Emily...

517
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,553
...Father Moore simply tried
to help Emily in a different way...

518
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:23,283
...using an approach that he,
Emily and her family firmly believed...

519
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,654
...was her only chance for relief.

520
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:28,490
And we will show that
despite his greatest efforts...

521
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,826
...and his sincere love for Emily...

522
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:37,204
...there was nothing he could've done
to prevent the death of Emily Rose.

523
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,375
Are you okay?

524
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,204
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

525
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:22,982
She said it was terrible to hear
the clinking of spoons and forks.

526
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,320
She was always hungry,
but she said they wouldn't let her eat.

527
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,718
Who did she mean by "they"?

528
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,595
The forces that were
in control of her.

529
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,095
That were inside her.

530
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,157
You know, the demons.

531
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,432
Tell us what else happened
that night.

532
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,945
I walked her back to her dorm...

533
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,344
...and she seemed really nervous
and scared.

534
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,350
So I held her for a while,
trying to calm her down.

535
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:03,015
I fell asleep, but when I woke up,
she wasn't beside me.

536
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,631
Emily?

537
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,343
Hey.

538
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,393
Can you hear me?

539
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,000
I called her father, and he told me
to bring Emily home.

540
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,875
Jason and I put Emily to bed...

541
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,241
...hoping she would sleep.

542
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,417
And when did Father Moore
become involved?

543
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:05,278
Emily stayed home after that.

544
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:09,585
She didn't return to school,
and she kept getting worse.

545
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:14,423
Eventually, when she didn't get better,
we called our priest, Father Moore.

546
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,825
When he arrived,
I sent my daughter Alice upstairs...

547
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,400
...to see if Emily was awake.

548
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,210
Emily?

549
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,385
Can I come in?

550
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:53,662
- Our Father, who art in heaven...
- Emily?

551
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,703
Father Moore is here.
Can you come downstairs?

552
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,106
- As it is in heaven.

553
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:06,680
Give us this day our daily bread...

554
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:56,694
Emily, can you hear me?

555
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:14,181
Let's get her off the floor.

556
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:16,644
Alice, no!

557
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,745
You've suffered a terrible loss,
Mr. Rose. I know this is difficult.

558
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,318
So thank you for being here today.

559
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,011
Sir, do you often read the Bible?

560
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,986
- Yes, I do.
- So do I.

561
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,757
What about the DSM?

562
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:07,828
The Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders...

563
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,091
...commonly referred to
as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.

564
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:12,791
- Have you read that?
- No.

565
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,232
So you're not aware
that according to the DSM...

566
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:19,602
...a person's refusal to eat is
a common indication of anorexia?

567
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:23,245
Objection. The witness just said
he hasn't read the DSM, Your Honor.

568
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,744
- Sustained.
- Mr. Rose...

569
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,511
...are you aware
that catatonic rigidity...

570
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,084
...specifically a locking up
of the body's joints...

571
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,948
...is a known symptom of psychosis?

572
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,454
No. I haven't studied these things.

573
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:37,785
Have you ever visited
an insane asylum...

574
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,254
...or a hospital for the mentally ill?

575
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,795
Once. My aunt was in one
before she died.

576
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,094
Really? So there's a history
of mental illness in your family?

577
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,127
I suppose.

578
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:52,206
Sir, if you saw someone
eating insects...

579
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:56,907
...on a street corner, would you say
that that person is mentally ill?

580
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:59,604
- Probably, yes.
- So can you say with confidence...

581
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:02,376
...that the behavior you saw
in your daughter's bedroom...

582
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,486
...could not be the behavior of
someone suffering from psychosis?

583
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:09,488
I don't know. She never had
any problems like that before.

584
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:13,994
It just didn't feel that way to me
or to Father Moore.

585
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:17,229
- And you trusted him, right?
- Yes.

586
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,095
He is our parish priest.

587
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:22,499
Fair enough. And after that night,
would you say that you...

588
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,230
...put your daughter entirely
in Father Moore's care?

589
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,967
Yes. We had done all we could.

590
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,476
We said she was in his hands now...

591
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,845
...body and soul.

592
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,952
Thank you. No further questions,
Your Honor.

593
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,121
Thank you, Mr. Rose.
You may step down.

594
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:44,155
The defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.

595
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,524
I am currently a professor
of anthropology and psychiatry...

596
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,824
...at Northwestern University.

597
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,695
Where did you receive
your education?

598
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:55,097
At Yale, and then at Cambridge.

599
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,705
And what is your specific area
of expertise?

600
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:02,207
I study the spiritual experiences
of people in various cultures...

601
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,711
...and the physiological
and psychological changes...

602
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:09,282
...they undergo
during these experiences.

603
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:13,479
Would it be accurate to say that you
specialize in the study of possession?

604
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:18,684
Yes. "Possession" is one term
for a basic human experience...

605
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:23,696
...reported by a great number
of people all around the world.

606
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,927
In my fieldwork, I've seen
many people who experienced...

607
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:32,870
...a sense of being invaded by
an entity from the supernatural realm.

608
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,010
Why do you think
Emily was invaded?

609
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,475
Why did this possession
happen to her?

610
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,114
Based on my study of the case file...

611
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:44,377
...I believe that Emily Rose
was a hypersensitive.

612
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,055
A person with
an unusual connection...

613
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:51,057
...to what Carlos Castaneda called
"the separate reality."

614
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:56,224
Hypersensitives are born
different from everyone else.

615
00:58:56,432 --> 00:59:00,266
They can have visions of the future,
or see the dead...

616
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,701
...and sometimes be
uniquely susceptible...

617
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,899
...to invasion by an entity
that is alien to them.

618
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,236
Objection.

619
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,646
On what grounds?

620
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,679
How about silliness, Your Honor?

621
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,578
A young girl
suffered terribly and died.

622
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:19,277
Do we have to subject her illness
to this pseudoscientific analysis?

623
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:22,390
Both counselors,
please approach the bench.

624
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:25,352
Your Honor, this testimony
is beyond ridiculous. Visions...

625
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,725
Supernatural belief systems
are shared by millions of people.

626
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:30,331
We're in The Twilight Zone here.

627
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,899
Her expertise is relevant
to the issues in this case.

628
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,195
Let's have a witch doctor
sift through bones...

629
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,838
Stop.

630
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,107
We've heard a great deal
of testimony...

631
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:46,373
...in support of a medical explanation
for Emily's condition.

632
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,676
Now we have a witness
who has spent her career...

633
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:52,116
...studying the defense's
alternative explanation.

634
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,313
An exorcism expert, if you will.

635
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,922
I think we'll hear
what she has to say.

636
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,389
Thank you, Your Honor.

637
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:06,258
Dr. Adani, why do you think
Emily's exorcism failed?

638
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:11,673
The medical treatment.
Specifically, the drug Gambutrol.

639
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:13,307
Please explain.

640
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:17,912
The exorcism ritual results
in a specific brain activity...

641
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,845
...that cuts the person off from
the possession experience.

642
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,851
But Emily's exorcism
could not have achieved this...

643
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:29,752
...because the doctor
gave her Gambutrol...

644
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,827
...which has an intoxicating effect
on the brain.

645
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:37,966
The drug made her immune
to the psycho-spiritual shock...

646
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,102
...that exorcism
is intended to provide.

647
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:45,263
What do you believe was the result of
treatment with this intoxicating drug?

648
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:49,172
Gambutrol locked Emily
in the possessed state.

649
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:52,746
This left her unable to respond
to the exorcism...

650
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:57,181
...and therefore, it directly
contributed to her death.

651
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,653
Thank you, doctor.

652
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,553
No further questions.

653
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:12,398
I'm looking at a list of
your published articles, doctor.

654
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,727
You've been quite busy and prolific.

655
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:18,565
So based on your time spent
with Holy Roller snake-handlers...

656
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:22,836
...voodoo priestesses
and Indians tripping on peyote buds...

657
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:26,878
...based on observing
these bizarre individuals...

658
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,074
...you've concluded
that possession is...

659
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:30,843
...a basic, typical
human experience?

660
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,612
I must say, counselor...

661
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:35,382
...that's quite a laundry list
of disdain...

662
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:39,083
...and one that thoroughly
mischaracterizes my research.

663
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:44,024
No, I don't think possession
is a typical experience.

664
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:48,863
But I am convinced that it is
a scientifically verified...

665
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:50,972
...culturally universal one.

666
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,574
Have you ever used Gambutrol
in your studies...

667
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:57,143
...to test your theory about its effect
on the possession experience?

668
01:01:57,346 --> 01:02:00,804
Absolutely not. That would be
dangerous to the patient.

669
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:04,783
So this notion of Gambutrol locking
someone in a possessed state...

670
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:08,320
...the key to your assertion that
her medical treatment harmed Emily...

671
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,651
...this would be your own
pet theory, correct?

672
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,454
- You're just making this one up?
- Objection. Argumentative.

673
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,028
Sustained.

674
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,689
Although I think he's just taking
a page from your book, counselor.

675
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,365
No further questions.

676
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,073
Erin!

677
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,449
I've got a doctor
who wants to testify.

678
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,646
He's an eyewitness, Erin.

679
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,685
He was there.
He was at the exorcism.

680
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,220
- What?
- He called us.

681
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:44,588
Dr. Graham Cartwright,
Department of Abnormal Psychiatry...

682
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:46,728
...at St. Mary's Hospital.

683
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:56,867
Dr. Cartwright. Ring a bell?

684
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:58,796
Yes.

685
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,072
He was there?

686
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:04,271
- Yes.
- Father...

687
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:07,675
...if you want me to defend you,
you've got to give me...

688
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,408
...all the information I need.

689
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,520
With all of this medical testimony
helping the prosecution...

690
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:16,123
...how could you not tell me
that a doctor attended the exorcism?

691
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:21,890
He asked that I keep
his involvement confidential...

692
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:23,830
...and I said I would.

693
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,413
Dr. Cartwright?

694
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,481
I recognize you from those
courtroom drawings on the news.

695
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,819
You're much prettier in real life.

696
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:55,526
- May I sit?
- Yes, please.

697
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,562
You're losing.

698
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,672
I had hoped Father Moore
wouldn't need me...

699
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:11,445
...but I don't wanna see him
put away.

700
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,807
How do you know him?

701
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:18,612
Well, I was his parishioner
at St. Vincent's Church...

702
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,288
...about 15 years ago.

703
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:25,054
I hadn't seen or heard of him for years
when he called me last fall.

704
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,827
But he needed help, so...

705
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,567
What kind of help, doctor?

706
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:35,767
He wanted a medical perspective
from a psychiatrist...

707
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:39,237
...you know, one that he knew,
trusted...

708
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:44,880
...to observe Emily's physical
and mental state during this...

709
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,650
During the exorcism.

710
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:50,747
Yeah.

711
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:58,984
Doctor.

712
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,621
Doctor.

713
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,224
Can you help our case?

714
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,871
That girl was not schizophrenic...

715
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,167
...and she was not epileptic,
or any combination of the two.

716
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,572
I've seen hundreds of people
with those problems.

717
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:21,113
They can be terrible afflictions,
of course, but they don't scare me.

718
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:24,184
But what you saw that night in Emily,
that did scare you.

719
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:27,049
God, if I'd known,
I never would've been there.

720
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:33,419
I started praying again
since then, you know.

721
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:40,727
I examined that girl before I drove
back to the city that night.

722
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,536
She was lucid...

723
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:46,606
...and she was completely aware
of this separate entity inside her.

724
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:52,039
When she wasn't in his grip, she was
totally herself, completely normal.

725
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:56,241
The awareness of her alternate mental
state is counterindicative of psychosis.

726
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,079
Crazy people
don't know they're crazy.

727
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,720
That's right.

728
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:03,449
You'll testify to all of this, in detail?

729
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,183
Everything you saw?

730
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:08,261
Send me the case files
and tell me when to be in court.

731
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,455
Thank you, doctor.

732
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,163
We need this.

733
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,534
Before he was arrested,
Father Moore sent this to me.

734
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,140
He asked me to take care of it.

735
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,574
It's your burden now.

736
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,544
One more thing.
When you saw Emily...

737
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,742
...did Father Moore ask you
to give her any medical help?

738
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,984
He was already trying to stop her from
injuring herself and urging her to eat.

739
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:38,820
And I told him, as a doctor,
I couldn't help her.

740
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,102
Dr. Cartwright's going to testify.

741
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,037
Don't you get it?

742
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,475
He's not just an eyewitness
to the exorcism.

743
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,844
He can also refute the prosecution's
medical case. This is huge for us.

744
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,042
When do I get to testify?

745
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:07,219
I don't know. Let's take this
one step at a time.

746
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:08,720
No.

747
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:14,021
What matters most is Emily's story,
which only I can tell.

748
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,523
I understand.

749
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,704
Have you thought about
what I said before?

750
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:27,675
About dark forces
and demonic attacks?

751
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,409
Yes, I have.

752
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:43,514
That day, after Briggs testified...

753
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,025
...I was feeling awful.

754
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:52,198
And I went out for a walk
just to clear my head...

755
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:56,667
...and I was thinking about
what you said to me. Thinking:

756
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,000
"What if demons really do exist?"

757
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:03,667
And wondering what that
would mean if I believed that.

758
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:09,547
Because God knows,
I have my own demons.

759
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,548
And I saw something
lying on the sidewalk.

760
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:20,553
It was a gold locket...

761
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,855
...with the initials E. C.B.
Engraved on it.

762
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:30,563
My middle name is Christine.

763
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:34,140
Erin Christine Bruner.

764
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:39,546
And of all the people walking by
that day, I found that locket.

765
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,477
What are the chances of that?

766
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,580
I don't know, maybe it was a sign.

767
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:49,815
Or maybe it was just some
incredible coincidence.

768
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,391
But it made me feel...

769
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:56,793
...like no matter what mistakes
I've made in the past...

770
01:08:56,999 --> 01:09:00,765
...at that moment, I was exactly
where I was meant to be.

771
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,131
Like I was on the right path.

772
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:09,239
You sound more like a mystic
than an agnostic.

773
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:13,310
Are you wearing the locket now?

774
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,278
No.

775
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,383
You should.

776
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:27,186
The archdiocese
doesn't want you to testify.

777
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:31,628
They're just afraid
that I'll embarrass them.

778
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,099
Testify to some medieval-sounding
supernatural nonsense.

779
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:38,098
They're expecting me
to talk you out of it.

780
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:40,965
I've just decided
I'm not even gonna try.

781
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,207
Why not?

782
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,342
If the archdiocese
wants to avoid embarrassment...

783
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,212
...they need you to walk out of here
a free man.

784
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,553
I believe a jury will find you
sincere and credible...

785
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,589
...and when Dr. Cartwright
corroborates your testimony...

786
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:59,090
...and refutes the prosecution's
medical arguments...

787
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:00,922
...we'll get an acquittal.

788
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,163
And everyone will thank me for it.

789
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,269
Emily!

790
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:01,750
God help me.

791
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,257
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

792
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:13,662
I do.

793
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,235
Father Moore, before you could
perform the exorcism...

794
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,998
...you had to get the sanction
of the Church, correct?

795
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,540
Yes, on October the 27th
of last year...

796
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:25,544
...I presented my assessment and
recommendation to the archbishop...

797
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:30,208
...and he authorized the exorcism
that day before I left the office.

798
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,386
Tell us what happened that night.

799
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:34,484
I drove home.

800
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,921
I sat up till after midnight
studying The Roman Ritual...

801
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,651
...thinking about what lay ahead.

802
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:41,796
You mean The Roman Ritual
of Exorcism.

803
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:43,555
A text used by Catholic priests...

804
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,757
...as a guide to performing
the exorcism rite.

805
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,630
Yes, I think I actually fell asleep
with the book in my hand.

806
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:50,566
What happened next?

807
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:52,932
I woke up, freezing.

808
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:56,236
It was exactly 3 a.m.

809
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:59,141
Three a.m. Is the demonic
witching hour.

810
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:02,416
It's a way for demons
to mock the Holy Trinity.

811
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:05,883
It's an inversion of 3 p.m.,
the miracle hour...

812
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:10,752
...which is traditionally accepted
as the hour of Christ's death.

813
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,761
I thought I smelled
something burning.

814
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,599
Only later did I connect it...

815
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,060
...and I remembered that that same
smell of something burning...

816
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,795
...had been perceived by Emily.

817
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:38,240
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners, now and...

818
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:46,948
Pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our...

819
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,490
At the hour of...

820
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:28,520
What do you make of this gesture,
this nod in your direction?

821
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:34,628
I don't know. Some kind
of acknowledgment, I guess.

822
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,329
That the game is on.

823
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,338
You're really God's gunslinger,
aren't you, Father?

824
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:47,003
Standing tall and facing the devil
with your prayer book at your side.

825
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,582
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel's harassing my witness.

826
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:54,188
Sustained. Mr. Thomas, you know
I won't allow that in my courtroom.

827
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:56,414
Forgive me, Your Honor.

828
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:02,259
Father, did you understand this
black-robed figure to be the devil?

829
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,227
I believe it was
a demonic manifestation.

830
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,799
Like the demonic force
you believe possessed Emily?

831
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,970
- Yes.
- Why do you think it appeared to you?

832
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,503
I believe the demonic
can appear as an apparition...

833
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:14,676
...much like a ghost,
in an attempt to excite our fear.

834
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:18,170
- Did it excite your fear, Father?
- It scared the hell out of me.

835
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,844
So this night, when you began to
prepare Emily's exorcism...

836
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:24,484
...was it your first encounter
with this demon ghost?

837
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,551
- Yes.
- Have you seen it again?

838
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,420
I've seen it ever since.

839
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:39,499
No further questions at this time.

840
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:46,065
Redirect, Your Honor.

841
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:50,706
Father Moore, after you received
the bishop's authorization...

842
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:52,676
...when did you proceed
with an exorcism?

843
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,178
October 31 st.

844
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,184
On Halloween.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?

845
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:01,217
Halloween tradition is based on
legends throughout history...

846
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:04,551
...that indicate a real increase
in spiritual activity on that night...

847
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,820
...and I thought we could use the
occasion to draw them into the open.

848
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,191
- The demons, you mean?
- Yes.

849
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,832
Father Moore...

850
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,628
...can you identify this?

851
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:19,601
It's my tape recorder.
I used it to record the exorcism.

852
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,834
Inside is the tape I made that night.

853
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,743
Why would you make such a tape?

854
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:28,007
Ever since the technology
has been available...

855
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:31,652
...exorcists have used tape recorders
to authenticate the ritual...

856
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:33,548
...and provide a record for review.

857
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,747
I offer into evidence this
cassette recorder and audiotape...

858
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:40,190
Objection. The people were not aware
of the existence of this tape...

859
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:42,056
...until last night.
- Neither were we.

860
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,233
This tape is new evidence that came
into our possession yesterday.

861
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,631
We provided counsel for the people
with a transcript of its contents.

862
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:51,237
You mean this tape was not
given to you by your client?

863
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,965
No, Your Honor. We received it
from a reluctant witness...

864
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:57,737
...Dr. Graham Cartwright, who will also
be called to testify to its authenticity.

865
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:00,676
The people will find his name
on the updated witness list...

866
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:02,543
...we provided to them this morning.

867
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,220
Very well. I'll allow it into evidence.

868
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:14,791
Father Moore.

869
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:18,726
Will you play the tape for us now?

870
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:29,109
This is the exorcism of Emily Rose.

871
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:33,069
Those present are myself,
Father Richard Moore...

872
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,550
...Nathaniel, Emily's father...

873
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,680
...Jason, her friend...

874
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:47,054
...a doctor who is here
to monitor Emily during the ritual...

875
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,661
...and Emily herself...

876
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:53,767
...who has given her permission
for the ritual to be performed.

877
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:56,966
All right, now listen.

878
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:02,977
You may say the rosary or any
private prayer for her deliverance...

879
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:06,170
...when you're not responding
to my words.

880
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:08,144
Above all...

881
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:11,481
...do whatever I ask,
without question.

882
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,821
Don't ask it any questions...

883
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:19,357
...or pay any attention
to what it says.

884
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:22,161
"Lt"?

885
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,730
We won't be dealing
with Emily tonight.

886
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:31,563
Restrain her.

887
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:42,907
Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us.

888
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:05,600
It has begun.

889
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:07,200
Let us pray.

890
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:16,682
"Because she hopes
in you, my God."

891
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,786
"Send her help from
the holy place, Lord."

892
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,646
"And give her heavenly protection."

893
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,951
"May the Lord be with you."

894
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,526
"And with your spirit."

895
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:32,860
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

896
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:36,730
My God. Are you all right?

897
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:49,717
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

898
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:51,613
I'm fine.

899
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,380
Give us this day our daily bread.

900
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:59,993
And forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those that trespass against us.

901
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,095
And lead us not into temptation...

902
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:06,563
But deliver us from evil!

903
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:11,427
Who are you, demon?
Tell me your name.

904
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:31,281
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, three, four, five, six.

905
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,587
Trick or treat.
I give you treats and tricks.

906
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:37,663
One, two, three, four, five, six.

907
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:44,802
Father Moore!

908
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:57,111
Papa!

909
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,259
Emily!

910
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:25,205
Emily!

911
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:30,550
She feels so hot, Father!
She's burning up!

912
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:37,650
Hold her down there on the straw!
Hold her!

913
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:43,925
Emily!

914
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:02,043
Doctor! I need you here now.

915
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:06,848
Watch her vital signs.

916
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:10,480
In the beginning was the word.

917
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:12,455
And the word was with God.

918
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:16,097
And the word was the word,
and what a wonderful word it was.

919
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:17,629
Through him all things remain.

920
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:20,426
Without him, nothing was made
that has been made.

921
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:25,630
And the 70 disciples
returned again with joy, saying:

922
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,571
"Lord, even the devils are subject
unto us through thy name."

923
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,975
Her heart is racing.
It's almost 180 beats a minute.

924
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:36,947
I beheld Satan as lightning
fall from heaven.

925
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:41,913
Behold. I give you power to tread on
serpents and scorpions...

926
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,250
...and over all the power
of the enemy.

927
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:47,519
And nothing shall,
by any means, hurt you.

928
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:11,945
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

929
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:23,531
Release him, demon. I command you
in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

930
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,201
Tell me your name, wicked one.

931
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:42,075
He who commands you is he
who ordered you thrown down...

932
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:44,774
...from the highest heaven
into the depths of hell.

933
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:49,719
In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
I now command you:

934
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:51,385
Tell me your name!

935
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:57,824
Hear, therefore, and fear,
Satan, enemy of the faith.

936
01:23:58,266 --> 01:23:59,858
Give me your name, demon!

937
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:03,532
Names!

938
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:06,764
Names!

939
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:15,409
Ancient serpents...

940
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:19,520
...depart from this servant of God!

941
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:22,253
Tell me your six names!

942
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:27,885
We are the ones who dwell within!

943
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:47,378
And I am Lucifer...

944
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:50,415
...the devil in the flesh.

945
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:07,528
Mr. Rose.

946
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:09,760
Doctor, help him!

947
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:29,788
After a few moments,
Mr. Rose revived...

948
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:32,755
...but the exorcism
had to be abandoned.

949
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:38,256
Emily was taken to her room
and soon fell into a deep sleep.

950
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:41,299
The whole thing
was a complete failure.

951
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:45,227
Describe her behavior from the night
of the failed exorcism...

952
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,032
...until the time of her death.

953
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,538
Violence towards others and herself.

954
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,611
Sometimes she screamed
for hours on end.

955
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:55,942
She drove her head through windows,
tried to bite...

956
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:59,348
Tried to bite holes in the walls,
breaking several more of her teeth...

957
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:01,988
...as you saw in
the postmortem photograph.

958
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,317
- You witnessed this?
- Some of it, yes.

959
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:06,687
I tried to visit every day...

960
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:08,886
...and the family told me the rest.

961
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:10,655
Did you attempt another exorcism?

962
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:14,329
I wanted to, but Emily refused.

963
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:16,367
And without the consent
of the possessed...

964
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:19,005
...the exorcism ritual
can't be performed.

965
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:20,799
Did you encourage her to eat?

966
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,467
Yes, every time I saw her...

967
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:26,670
...but the few times she tried,
it seemed like...

968
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:30,081
Seemed like she couldn't swallow,
or she couldn't keep it down.

969
01:26:30,285 --> 01:26:31,582
What about medical care?

970
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:35,187
I wanted her to continue. I never said
she should quit seeing her doctors.

971
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,790
That would be wrong.
Medical care is not my field.

972
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:41,189
But you did suggest she stop
taking the drug Gambutrol.

973
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:45,860
Yes.

974
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:51,861
After the exorcism,
she asked for my counsel.

975
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:54,537
She told me that the drugs
had never helped her.

976
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:57,575
After all, she was on Gambutrol
during the exorcism...

977
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:00,270
...when her so-called symptoms
were at their peak.

978
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:05,814
Ultimately, we both felt that
she was beyond medical care...

979
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:10,389
...and that she had to see this
through to the end...

980
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:12,951
...by faith alone.

981
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:21,132
The dual voices we just heard
on this tape...

982
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:26,303
...you're certain that they were both
coming from Emily at the same time?

983
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:27,769
Yes. Yes, I heard them.

984
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:30,467
Have you tampered
with this tape in any way?

985
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,539
No. No, I have not.

986
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,482
No further questions at this time.

987
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,484
Mr. Thomas.

988
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:50,457
Father Moore, you consider this tape
to be proof of the supernatural?

989
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:55,194
I think it's a record
of certain indications...

990
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:57,268
...that Emily was possessed.

991
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:59,133
Signs of possession,
you may call them.

992
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,537
By "signs of possession," would you
mean her speaking in languages...

993
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:04,712
...we might assume
she couldn't possibly know?

994
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:08,006
And the vocalization of two
distinct voices simultaneously?

995
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:11,583
Yes. Among other signs that I
observed and described to the court...

996
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,686
...while the tape was playing.
Things I saw.

997
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:15,355
Things you can't hear
on the tape.

998
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:17,490
We'll just have to take
your word, won't we?

999
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:19,319
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Thomas.

1000
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:22,795
I apologize.
Father, as Emily's parish priest...

1001
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:25,830
...are you aware that she underwent
advanced catechism training?

1002
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,592
Yes. Yes. Her family is very devout.

1003
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:31,169
And in that training, did she study
Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Latin?

1004
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:32,498
Yes, I think that's right.

1005
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:36,074
Might have even studied Aramaic,
Christ and his disciples' language...

1006
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:39,735
...which, according to the transcripts,
we also heard on the tape, correct?

1007
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:42,677
She spoke Aramaic on the tape.
It wasn't part of her training.

1008
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,444
But it was offered as an elective
at her catechism school.

1009
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:48,486
I have the school's curriculum
here if you'd like to see it.

1010
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:52,421
No. I'll accept that she might have
been exposed to that language.

1011
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:54,458
And according to
her high school records...

1012
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:57,187
...German was the foreign language
she studied there, yes?

1013
01:28:57,398 --> 01:28:58,592
I don't know. If you say so.

1014
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,361
So that covers the strange languages
we heard on the tape, correct?

1015
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:05,002
Did I miss any?

1016
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:07,468
- No.
- Good.

1017
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:09,939
We've already established
you're no medical expert.

1018
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,406
You said it's not your field.

1019
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:15,309
But are you aware of the dual sets of
vocal cords every human possesses?

1020
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:16,844
- No.
- Have you heard of...

1021
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:21,351
...the superior vocal cords, which are
higher than the ones we use to speak?

1022
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:24,218
No. So you didn't know that
Tibetan monks, for example...

1023
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:27,155
...as part of their religious training,
teach themselves...

1024
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,763
...to activate both sets
of vocal cords at once?

1025
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:32,592
No, I didn't know that.

1026
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,428
Well, now that you do know,
would you think it's possible...

1027
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:37,399
...that Emily, in her psychotic state...

1028
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:39,869
...might have activated both sets
of vocal cords...

1029
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:43,475
...so as to achieve the amazing effect
we heard captured on your audiotape?

1030
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:44,940
Her state was not psychotic.

1031
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:47,842
Father Moore, you told us
that in the exorcism we heard...

1032
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:51,450
...you actually saw, once again,
this black-robed figure...

1033
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:54,280
...or demonic apparition, am I right?
- Yes.

1034
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:57,083
But we couldn't see him
when you played the tape, correct?

1035
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:58,781
- No, of course not.
- Of course not.

1036
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:01,791
So that would be another
supernatural aspect of the exorcism...

1037
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:05,454
...your tape doesn't prove, correct?
- Yes.

1038
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:08,235
Where is your dark figure, Father?

1039
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:10,734
Is he here now?
Do I look like your demon ghost?

1040
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:12,838
- Your Honor.
- Counselor.

1041
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,376
I have nothing further.

1042
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,380
Does the defense wish to redirect?

1043
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:25,018
No, Your Honor, but we reserve
the right to recall the witness later.

1044
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:28,049
Very well.
The witness may step down.

1045
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:37,860
Your Honor, my next witness
must have been detained.

1046
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:40,033
If we could take a short recess
so I could...

1047
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:43,692
You've made this court wait before,
counselor. I'm inclined to...

1048
01:30:43,905 --> 01:30:45,532
Your Honor, please.

1049
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:48,368
Dr. Cartwright came to us
in good conscience...

1050
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:51,670
...as an eyewitness to the exorcism
on Father Moore's tape.

1051
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:54,939
He can substantiate
all of my client's testimony...

1052
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:58,277
Your Honor, the defense has already
presented its exorcism testimony...

1053
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:01,046
...in dramatic fashion.
Do we really have to...?

1054
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:10,953
We have absorbed some
extraordinary testimony today.

1055
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:14,094
I think we'll take some time
to consider it.

1056
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,964
Court is adjourned
until 9:30 tomorrow morning.

1057
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,341
- You can't find him?
- I went to meet him, he didn't show.

1058
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:24,534
I called his office, I called his house.

1059
01:31:24,745 --> 01:31:29,375
Okay. Go to the hospital, ask around.
Somebody's gotta know where he is.

1060
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:43,530
What the hell happened?

1061
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:47,432
Tell Father Moore I'm sorry.

1062
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:51,661
Tell him I know the demons are real
and I admire his courage...

1063
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:54,034
...for standing and speaking
against them.

1064
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:57,105
Tell him I know what they can do.

1065
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:22,567
- Cartwright's dead.
- I heard.

1066
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:25,161
Are you drunk?

1067
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:30,368
- Not yet, but I'm working on it.
- Have you seen this?

1068
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:37,750
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Karl...

1069
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:40,284
You told me you'd talk him out
of testifying.

1070
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:42,786
Instead, you put on a freak show
with taped demons...

1071
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:44,753
...and a dead girl
speaking in tongues...

1072
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:49,157
...and your client testifies that the
archbishop sanctioned the exorcism.

1073
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:51,856
We'll be lucky if
the archdiocese isn't named...

1074
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:54,500
I had a doctor
who was gonna corroborate.

1075
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:57,671
Besides that, Father Moore's
testimony's crucial to his defense.

1076
01:32:57,872 --> 01:33:00,397
Did you forget the archdiocese
is paying for this defense?

1077
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:02,371
The archdiocese isn't on trial.

1078
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:06,679
I swore an oath to do
what's best for my client.

1079
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:08,974
Spare me the law school pieties,
Bruner.

1080
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:11,208
You cashed in your conscience
at the door.

1081
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,320
- People can change.
- Like James Van Hopper?

1082
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:19,517
It's not over.

1083
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:21,921
I can put Mr. Rose on the stand...

1084
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:24,290
...to corroborate Father Moore
about the exorcism.

1085
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:27,296
And there are the girls.
Her sister Alice, she saw part of it.

1086
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:30,436
They all look like superstitious rubes.
They've got no credibility.

1087
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:31,969
Thomas will rip them to pieces.

1088
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:34,869
You'll be worse off than you are now,
if that's possible.

1089
01:33:35,876 --> 01:33:37,639
You're gonna replace me
on this case.

1090
01:33:38,412 --> 01:33:40,471
You've screwed it up
beyond all repair.

1091
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:43,481
But the archdiocese feels
that replacing you now...

1092
01:33:43,684 --> 01:33:46,551
...would only draw more
unnecessary attention to the trial.

1093
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:48,278
But just so we're clear, Bruner...

1094
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:53,221
...if you put that priest
on the stand again, I will fire you.

1095
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:21,819
You've been crying.

1096
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:28,319
- Dr. Cartwright is dead.
- What?

1097
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:33,595
He was killed.
There was an accident. I'm sorry.

1098
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,597
I know he was your friend.

1099
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:44,100
We've lost.

1100
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,814
Without his testimony, it's over.

1101
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:51,575
No.

1102
01:34:51,786 --> 01:34:56,120
No, no, no, it isn't over. We're telling
Emily's story. That's what matters.

1103
01:34:56,323 --> 01:34:58,484
- It can't be worth all this.
- Yes, it is worth it.

1104
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:01,719
Just let me go back on the stand
and tell the rest of the story.

1105
01:35:01,929 --> 01:35:04,056
- I can't do that.
- You must!

1106
01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:06,361
You must.

1107
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:16,667
Erin, you once said that you felt
you were on the right path.

1108
01:35:17,778 --> 01:35:20,804
Don't stray from that path.

1109
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:23,810
Here, take this.

1110
01:35:24,018 --> 01:35:26,350
- What is this?
- Just read it.

1111
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:29,921
And then decide
what you want to do.

1112
01:35:31,425 --> 01:35:36,362
I saw your eyes today in court when
I explained the significance of 3 a.m.

1113
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:43,162
It's not going to stop
until Emily's story is told.

1114
01:36:24,645 --> 01:36:26,579
Are you gonna make a statement?

1115
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:30,941
Do you believe it was the devil?

1116
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:45,124
Is the defense ready to proceed?

1117
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:49,200
Yes, Your Honor. The defense
recalls Father Richard Moore.

1118
01:36:56,577 --> 01:36:59,876
The witness is reminded
that he is still under oath.

1119
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,553
- When did you last see Emily alive?
- The night before she died.

1120
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:16,025
Her mother, Maria, called me
and said that Emily had asked for me.

1121
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:18,824
- Why did she ask to see you?
- To give me this.

1122
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:21,631
Did Emily explain to you
the letter's significance?

1123
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:27,132
Yes. She said she'd written it the
morning after the failed exorcism...

1124
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:29,807
...and that it was important
for me to share.

1125
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:36,681
Father Moore,
was Emily a good person?

1126
01:37:38,285 --> 01:37:43,587
I believe that one day
Emily will be recognized as a saint.

1127
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:47,490
- So she loved God.
- Yes. She was very devout.

1128
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,463
Father Moore, if Emily loved God...

1129
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:53,360
...if she was so good and so devout,
why do you think God...

1130
01:37:53,567 --> 01:37:55,262
...allowed this to happen?
- Objection.

1131
01:37:55,469 --> 01:37:57,130
What is the relevance
of that question?

1132
01:37:57,338 --> 01:37:59,533
Father Moore's belief
in this matter is crucial...

1133
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:02,732
...in establishing his and Emily's
understanding of her condition.

1134
01:38:02,943 --> 01:38:05,912
And that mutual understanding
is paramount in determining...

1135
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:08,308
...whether Father Moore was,
in fact, negligent.

1136
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:12,279
I'm going to allow it.

1137
01:38:12,486 --> 01:38:15,011
Your Honor, you're not really gonna
let someone testify...

1138
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:18,385
...about why God would allow
the death of a young girl?

1139
01:38:18,592 --> 01:38:21,083
The objection has been overruled.

1140
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:23,426
Again, Father Moore:

1141
01:38:24,965 --> 01:38:29,459
Why did God allow Emily to become
possessed by demons and then die?

1142
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:32,230
I can let Emily answer that.

1143
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:39,736
"Last night, on Allhallows' Eve...

1144
01:38:39,947 --> 01:38:44,350
...Father Moore tried to cast
six demons from my body.

1145
01:38:45,019 --> 01:38:46,782
They refused to go.

1146
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:50,490
After the attempted exorcism..."

1147
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:55,488
I was taken to my room,
and I fell into a deep sleep.

1148
01:38:57,364 --> 01:39:02,392
I awoke a few hours later,
hearing a voice calling out my name.

1149
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:20,243
"Again, I heard a voice
calling my name.

1150
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:24,011
It was the Blessed Holy Mother
of God.

1151
01:40:25,052 --> 01:40:27,179
And when I looked at her...

1152
01:40:27,788 --> 01:40:31,019
...she smiled at me and said:

1153
01:40:31,825 --> 01:40:34,988
'Emily, heaven is not blind
to your pain."'

1154
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:38,687
She said the Virgin Mary spoke to her
in the middle of a field?

1155
01:40:39,233 --> 01:40:41,599
- Yes.
- And do you believe her?

1156
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:43,702
I believe Emily spoke the truth.

1157
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:46,737
Please continue.

1158
01:40:49,309 --> 01:40:53,507
"I asked the Blessed Mother,
'Why do I suffer like this?"'

1159
01:40:54,148 --> 01:40:57,117
Why did the demons
not leave me tonight?

1160
01:40:58,585 --> 01:41:01,884
"She said, 'I am sorry, Emily.

1161
01:41:02,156 --> 01:41:05,216
The demons are going to stay
where they are. '

1162
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:09,359
Then she said,
'You can come with me in peace...

1163
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:12,321
...free of your bodily form...

1164
01:41:12,866 --> 01:41:15,960
...or you can choose
to continue this.

1165
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:19,305
You will suffer greatly.

1166
01:41:19,506 --> 01:41:25,172
But through you, many will come to
see that the realm of the spirit is real.

1167
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:30,045
The choice is yours. "'

1168
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:39,984
I choose to stay.

1169
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:13,954
"In the end,
good will triumph over evil.

1170
01:42:14,761 --> 01:42:16,922
Through my experience...

1171
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:20,331
...people will know
that demons are real.

1172
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:26,471
People say that God is dead.

1173
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:31,611
But how can they think that...

1174
01:42:32,179 --> 01:42:34,238
...if I show them the devil?"

1175
01:42:39,853 --> 01:42:43,812
Did you see these wounds on both
of Emily's hands and both feet?

1176
01:42:44,024 --> 01:42:48,961
Yes. Yes, the wounds
lasted for some time.

1177
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:53,361
And did you attach any supernatural
significance to these wounds?

1178
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:57,669
I believe they were stigmata.

1179
01:42:57,871 --> 01:42:59,839
By that, you mean
supernatural injuries...

1180
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:03,009
...that correspond to the crucifixion
wounds of Jesus Christ?

1181
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:04,837
Yes.

1182
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:12,179
Stigmata are a sign, a mark
indicating one is touched by God.

1183
01:43:16,089 --> 01:43:20,549
After that night, why do you think
Emily refused another exorcism?

1184
01:43:21,795 --> 01:43:25,196
I believe she'd accepted her fate.

1185
01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:30,660
Is there anything else
you'd like to say about Emily?

1186
01:43:34,908 --> 01:43:36,307
No.

1187
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:41,040
The defense rests.

1188
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:52,490
Father Moore attaches
divine significance...

1189
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:56,220
...to the wounds
on Emily's hands and feet.

1190
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:57,863
Why?

1191
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:03,192
Because he sees them as confirmation
of what he wants to believe.

1192
01:44:04,471 --> 01:44:07,736
That Emily was a saint,
touched by the hand of God.

1193
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:12,303
I'm afraid the truth
is far less inspiring.

1194
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:18,282
Because the truth is, by the time
these miraculous wounds appeared...

1195
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:21,617
...Emily had already shown
a tendency to injure herself...

1196
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:25,087
...and simply did so again
on one of the barbed-wire fences...

1197
01:44:25,292 --> 01:44:28,625
...surrounding the Rose family farm.

1198
01:44:33,567 --> 01:44:39,802
Father Moore's beliefs are based on
archaic and irrational superstition.

1199
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:42,999
Emily suffered
because she was sick...

1200
01:44:44,411 --> 01:44:46,140
...not because she was a saint.

1201
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:52,077
I'm a man of faith.
And I am also a man of facts.

1202
01:44:52,753 --> 01:44:58,316
And in here,
facts are what must matter.

1203
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:02,128
And these are the facts of this case:

1204
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:07,229
Emily Rose had epilepsy,
which caused psychosis.

1205
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:11,128
And, given time,
medicine would have cured her.

1206
01:45:11,338 --> 01:45:15,775
But it didn't. Why? Because Father
Richard Moore convinced Emily...

1207
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:20,413
...that she wasn't ill,
that she didn't need medicine.

1208
01:45:20,614 --> 01:45:23,412
And in the weeks
leading up to her death...

1209
01:45:23,617 --> 01:45:27,678
...when she was clearly in need
of medical treatment...

1210
01:45:28,355 --> 01:45:30,585
...he failed to have her hospitalized.

1211
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:42,165
So...

1212
01:45:42,936 --> 01:45:46,133
...the defense has given us
an extraordinary...

1213
01:45:46,606 --> 01:45:51,305
...creative explanation
for the events that led to this.

1214
01:45:51,812 --> 01:45:58,149
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't you believe it.

1215
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:03,555
Because the fact is, it wasn't the devil
that did this to Emily Rose.

1216
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:08,919
It was the defendant.

1217
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,608
Counselor.

1218
01:46:37,290 --> 01:46:40,919
Ethan Thomas calls himself
a man of faith.

1219
01:46:46,333 --> 01:46:49,063
I, on the other hand,
am a woman of doubt.

1220
01:46:53,206 --> 01:46:55,333
Angels and demons.

1221
01:46:56,176 --> 01:46:58,041
God and the devil.

1222
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:05,449
These things either exist,
or they do not exist.

1223
01:47:08,188 --> 01:47:09,883
Are we all alone in this life?

1224
01:47:10,557 --> 01:47:12,616
Or are we not alone?

1225
01:47:13,527 --> 01:47:16,325
Either thought is astonishing.

1226
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:23,329
Do I really believe that this tragedy
is the work of the devil?

1227
01:47:23,537 --> 01:47:25,300
To be honest, I don't know.

1228
01:47:26,973 --> 01:47:29,703
But I cannot deny that it's possible.

1229
01:47:30,377 --> 01:47:32,174
The prosecution
wants you to believe...

1230
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:35,678
...that Emily's psychotic
epileptic disorder was a fact...

1231
01:47:35,882 --> 01:47:39,978
...because facts leave no room
for reasonable doubt.

1232
01:47:40,187 --> 01:47:42,417
But this trial isn't about facts.

1233
01:47:43,356 --> 01:47:46,120
This trial is about possibilities.

1234
01:47:46,693 --> 01:47:49,423
Is it a fact that Emily
was a hypersensitive...

1235
01:47:49,629 --> 01:47:51,119
...as Dr. Adani suggests?

1236
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:57,031
A person who's more likely, by her
very nature, to become possessed?

1237
01:47:58,371 --> 01:48:02,273
I can't say that, but the question is:

1238
01:48:02,943 --> 01:48:04,137
Is it possible?

1239
01:48:06,379 --> 01:48:10,042
Is it a fact that Gambutrol
anesthetized Emily's brain...

1240
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:13,686
...so that the exorcism ritual
was rendered ineffective?

1241
01:48:15,922 --> 01:48:17,719
I can't be sure of that.

1242
01:48:20,126 --> 01:48:21,354
But is it possible?

1243
01:48:23,063 --> 01:48:27,329
Is it a fact that Emily
was beloved by God?

1244
01:48:29,236 --> 01:48:32,899
And that after her exorcism,
she chose to suffer till the end...

1245
01:48:33,106 --> 01:48:36,007
...so that we might believe
in a more magical world?

1246
01:48:36,209 --> 01:48:39,872
A world where the spiritual realm
really exists?

1247
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:42,548
I can't say that's a fact.

1248
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,377
But ask yourself:

1249
01:48:47,754 --> 01:48:49,016
Is it possible?

1250
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:52,749
It's what Emily believed.

1251
01:48:52,959 --> 01:48:54,654
It's what Father Moore believed.

1252
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:59,457
And that sincere belief is what
determined her choices and his.

1253
01:48:59,666 --> 01:49:03,397
Now, for the most
important question:

1254
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:07,567
Is Father Richard Moore guilty...

1255
01:49:07,774 --> 01:49:11,505
...beyond a reasonable doubt,
of negligent homicide?

1256
01:49:12,045 --> 01:49:16,914
Did he, in fact, neglect
Emily's needs in such a way...

1257
01:49:17,117 --> 01:49:19,517
...that her death
is now on his hands?

1258
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:23,746
No! That is not a fact.

1259
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:26,653
It is not a fact
that Emily was epileptic.

1260
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:31,263
It is not a fact
that she was psychotic.

1261
01:49:31,464 --> 01:49:32,931
Facts...

1262
01:49:33,667 --> 01:49:36,932
...leave no room for possibilities.

1263
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:39,770
The only fact...

1264
01:49:39,973 --> 01:49:45,036
...the only thing I know
beyond a doubt in this case...

1265
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:48,737
...is that Father Moore
loved Emily with his whole heart.

1266
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:52,448
He did everything in his power
to help her.

1267
01:49:52,652 --> 01:49:57,385
He has risked his very freedom
so we could hear her story.

1268
01:50:04,364 --> 01:50:05,888
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1269
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:09,432
...in my job I sometimes
have to defend bad men.

1270
01:50:10,837 --> 01:50:13,738
Father Richard Moore
is not one of them.

1271
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:18,808
Don't send a good man to prison.

1272
01:50:19,012 --> 01:50:22,072
I'm not asking that you believe
everything that Father Moore believes.

1273
01:50:22,282 --> 01:50:25,683
I'm simply asking that you believe
in Father Moore.

1274
01:50:42,802 --> 01:50:44,827
Madam Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

1275
01:50:45,171 --> 01:50:46,695
We have, Your Honor.

1276
01:50:58,852 --> 01:51:00,945
Please read the verdict out loud.

1277
01:51:05,558 --> 01:51:08,618
"In the case of The People
v. Father Richard Moore...

1278
01:51:08,828 --> 01:51:11,558
...we, the jury, find the defendant...

1279
01:51:11,765 --> 01:51:14,666
...guilty of negligent homicide."

1280
01:51:16,503 --> 01:51:18,903
The court thanks the jury
for its service.

1281
01:51:20,206 --> 01:51:24,199
Sentencing for this case
will be set for April 3rd.

1282
01:51:24,411 --> 01:51:26,538
Your Honor, if it pleases the court...

1283
01:51:26,746 --> 01:51:28,907
...Father Moore requested
at the start of trial...

1284
01:51:29,115 --> 01:51:31,879
...that if found guilty,
he would be sentenced immediately.

1285
01:51:32,085 --> 01:51:34,019
Yes, I recall that.

1286
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:38,384
Does the prosecution have any
objection to expedited sentencing?

1287
01:51:39,426 --> 01:51:40,916
Very well.

1288
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:47,690
Father Richard Moore,
do you understand this sentence...

1289
01:51:47,901 --> 01:51:50,529
...which has been found against you?
- Yes, Your Honor.

1290
01:51:50,737 --> 01:51:53,069
And do you understand
the gravity of this crime?

1291
01:51:53,273 --> 01:51:57,733
That you may, under the law, be
sentenced to a term of up to 10 years?

1292
01:51:57,944 --> 01:51:59,241
Yes, I do.

1293
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:01,346
Are there any statements
you wish to make...

1294
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:03,106
...before I impose this sentence?

1295
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:05,181
- No, Your Honor.
- Very well.

1296
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:07,478
Excuse me, Your Honor...

1297
01:52:07,687 --> 01:52:10,053
...but the jury would like to make
a recommendation...

1298
01:52:10,256 --> 01:52:12,087
...regarding the sentence.
- Objection.

1299
01:52:12,592 --> 01:52:14,059
Sit down, counselor.

1300
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:17,752
It's only a recommendation,
and I would like to hear it.

1301
01:52:20,266 --> 01:52:22,757
We recommend a sentence
of time served.

1302
01:52:32,912 --> 01:52:34,209
I'll accept that.

1303
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:40,742
You are guilty, Father Moore.

1304
01:52:42,021 --> 01:52:43,750
And you are free to go.

1305
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:48,094
- This court is dismissed.
- All rise.

1306
01:52:56,136 --> 01:52:57,433
Thank you.

1307
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:27,395
Well, you shocked us all.

1308
01:53:28,001 --> 01:53:30,401
Everyone at the firm sees this
as another victory.

1309
01:53:30,603 --> 01:53:32,628
The archdiocese is pleased.

1310
01:53:32,839 --> 01:53:35,706
They feel the trial has raised
public interest in the Church.

1311
01:53:35,909 --> 01:53:37,638
Have you seen the news?

1312
01:53:37,844 --> 01:53:40,369
There's our priest,
leaving the courthouse a free man...

1313
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:42,207
...right next to you.

1314
01:53:42,615 --> 01:53:44,810
Just like James Van Hopper.

1315
01:53:46,686 --> 01:53:48,620
All right, I'll say it. I was wrong.

1316
01:53:48,922 --> 01:53:50,287
But I'm ready to make it right.

1317
01:53:50,924 --> 01:53:53,620
I'm offering you
a full partnership in the firm.

1318
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:58,820
Keep it.

1319
01:54:23,256 --> 01:54:25,952
Will you be able to return
to your parish?

1320
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:31,023
I can't go back.

1321
01:54:31,464 --> 01:54:33,022
Not now.

1322
01:54:35,301 --> 01:54:37,201
Once you've looked
into the darkness...

1323
01:54:38,471 --> 01:54:41,872
...I think you carry it with you
for the rest of your life.

1324
01:54:46,179 --> 01:54:47,703
What about you?

1325
01:54:50,216 --> 01:54:52,844
I believe you've seen
the darkness too.

1326
01:54:56,489 --> 01:54:58,150
I don't know.

1327
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:02,924
I'm not sure what I've seen.

1328
01:55:11,971 --> 01:55:15,372
- Who chose the epitaph?
- I did.

1329
01:55:16,276 --> 01:55:20,144
It's from the second chapter
of Philippians, verse 12.

1330
01:55:20,813 --> 01:55:24,214
Emily recited it to me
the night before she died.
