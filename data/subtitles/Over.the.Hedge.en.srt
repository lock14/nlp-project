1
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:37,185
Oh, no!

2
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:39,052
Come on!

3
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:57,299
Come on, baby.

4
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,508
Grab it!

5
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:11,752
All right.

6
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:17,952
What...?

7
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:34,534
Vincent.

8
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,544
No, no, bad idea. Bad idea!

9
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,824
Just take what you need.

10
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:02,958
Just take what you need.

11
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:24,344
What's...?

12
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,318
RJ?

13
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:58,214
No?

14
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:00,519
The moon's not full.

15
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:03,186
You woke me up a week early?

16
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,023
Oh, no.

17
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:13,162
Don't tell me you're dumb enough
to actually try and steal my stuff.

18
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:16,332
RJ, I'm gonna have to kill you.

19
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:19,343
Please, I'm just a desperate guy
trying to feed his family.

20
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:22,244
- You don't have a family.
- I meant a family of one.

21
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:25,771
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Look, it's still in the cave.

22
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,683
So, technically, not stolen.

23
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,109
Oh, no!

24
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:32,584
No!

25
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:38,659
Slow!

26
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:42,396
Stop!

27
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,532
That was close.

28
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:56,310
Vincent, wait! I can get it all back!

29
00:04:57,282 --> 00:05:00,217
That's right!
If you eat me, you'd have to do it.

30
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:02,048
But I can get it. All of it!

31
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:05,950
- My red wagon?
- Redder!

32
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:08,925
- The blue cooler?
- Blue cooler. On my list!

33
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,358
- Gotta be blue?
- Yes!

34
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:13,363
And I want my Spuddies.
I love those things.

35
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:17,265
'Cause with a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.

36
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:20,236
So true. Painfully true.
And I'll tell you what.

37
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:23,138
I'm gonna get you the giant picnic pack,
family-fun size.

38
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,109
- They have that?
- I'm pretty sure.

39
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:30,205
All right, RJ. I'm going back to sleep.

40
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,977
When that moon is full, I'm waking up.

41
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:37,647
And all my stuff had better
be right back where it was.

42
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:41,214
But that's just one week!
That's impossible for one guy!

43
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,419
A week's perfect. I'll get some helpers.

44
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:47,864
Full moon, all my stuff.
And don't even think about running away.

45
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:52,801
Because if you do,
I will hunt you down and kill you.

46
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:59,740
OK! OK, buddy! You just rest easy,
all right, 'cause I'm on it.

47
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:05,215
Hey, in a week from now, we're
gonna be laughing about this thing.

48
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,970
Oh, boy, that's cold! That's cold!

49
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:44,947
The one place I didn't have a shell.

50
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,419
Wow.

51
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:06,025
Spring.

52
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:08,732
That means there's only
274 days left till winter.

53
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:11,604
Everybody, wake up! Hibernation's over.

54
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:13,166
Oh, morning!

55
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,906
- Morning, Hammy.
- I gotta go wee-wee!

56
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,210
Not in the lake we drink from!

57
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:20,876
Let's go, all right, the rest of you.
It's spring!

58
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:22,817
That means we gotta get to work.

59
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:25,947
Finished. No, wait!

60
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:29,016
Come on, everybody. Wake up.
Don't make me come in there.

61
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,458
Ya'll better listen.

62
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:34,464
I've been holding something in
all winter, and I'm about to let it out.

63
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:37,262
- I'm up, I'm up!
- She means it. Let's go!

64
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:38,991
Thank you, Stella.

65
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,369
Oh, I can clear a room, Verne.
Come on, that much I can do.

66
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,670
- Good morning.
- Good morning, everyone!

67
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:47,973
- How'd you guys sleep?
- Just a super-duper morning.

68
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:49,445
Oh, jeepers.

69
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:52,847
Whoa, not lookin' so good
around the eyes there, hon.

70
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,351
Bucky and Quillo were up
every three or four weeks.

71
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,853
And Spike kept poking me.

72
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:58,889
Yeah. Well, he's kinda pokey.

73
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,856
He's the sharpest of the bunch there.

74
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:03,359
You know what?
How 'bout I take the day shift?

75
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:05,225
Oh, Lou, that'd be just super.

76
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:09,562
All right, kids, you heard your mother,
and now you listen to me. Shape up.

77
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:12,466
Oh, boy.

78
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:14,505
This is what I was afraid of.

79
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:17,905
Where's the food? Is there any left?
I'm hungry, so is there any left?

80
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:22,309
We ate all the food, Hammy. During the
winter? We gotta go get some more now.

81
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,575
Oh, right!
I buried some nuts in the woods.

82
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,981
I know where they are.
I'll be right back. Bye!

83
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:34,547
- That's enough.
- Dad, it was just snow.

84
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,855
But it could have been a predator.

85
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:39,260
Isn't playing dead a little... weak?

86
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,821
Heather, how many times must I say it?

87
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:44,424
Playing possum is what we do.

88
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,936
We die so that we live!

89
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,131
I'm the boss of you, OK? So calm down.

90
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:52,643
That's what we need to find you
this year, don't you know? A good fella.

91
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,441
- A good fella? A good fella?
- Jeepers, here we go.

92
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,448
Why does everyone think I need a man?

93
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,950
I look like a nest
and smell like a swamp.

94
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,316
So when you find a fella who's decent,

95
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:06,652
good with kids
and has no sense of smell, call me.

96
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,331
- Hello?
- I don't care who started it.

97
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,963
- Hello?
- I don't care who started it.

98
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:20,765
Oh, look, food.

99
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:24,205
Well, I think you know what this means.

100
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:26,641
- Verne.
- Just a minute, Hammy.

101
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:30,647
This means we were nine berries
away from starvation.

102
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:32,944
Sorry. That was a little intense.

103
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:35,542
I meant really serious hunger pains.

104
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,144
Verne!

105
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,190
- Not finished, Hammy.
- Morning, Lou, Penny.

106
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:42,317
- Thanks.
- Hey, kids.

107
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,361
- What I want to tell you is...
- Verne!

108
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:47,659
I'm not done, Hammy.
If you have to go again, just go.

109
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:50,565
OK. So all I'm saying
is we cut it a little close.

110
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:53,433
So this year we need
to make sure that we fill the log...

111
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:56,803
- All the way to the top.
- Exactly. All the way to the top.

112
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:59,138
- Because what are we?
- Foragers!

113
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,338
- And what do we forage?
- Food!

114
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,813
- Right.
- Super, Verne, really super.

115
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,747
OK, Hammy.

116
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:08,183
- What is it?
- What is what?

117
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,742
What is it you want to tell me?

118
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:13,849
What was it, what was it,
what was it, what was it?

119
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:16,086
Wait. Right on the tip of my tongue.
Oh, yeah!

120
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,424
There's a weird thing
I've never seen before.

121
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:20,760
It's really scary. Follow me.

122
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,001
OK. Meeting called
on account of weird scary thing.

123
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,537
Let's go.

124
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,007
Foragers...

125
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,642
Hammy, what weird thing?

126
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:38,808
Oh. That weird thing.

127
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,105
It never ends!

128
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:13,583
Hey!

129
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:17,517
It never ends that way too!

130
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:19,351
- Jeepers, Lou.
- Whoa.

131
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:21,584
Yeah, jeepers is the word there, hon.

132
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:24,856
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Man, that's big.

133
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:30,396
- What is this thing?
- Heather, no!

134
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:33,665
- I'm scared.
- Me too, Mama.

135
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:36,707
It's OK, it's just a...
What is this thing, Lou?

136
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:40,232
I... Well, it's a... It's... Verne?

137
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,905
Well, it's... it's obviously...

138
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,447
...some kind of bush?

139
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,211
I'd be less afraid of it
if I just knew what it was called.

140
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:49,344
- Let's call it Steve!
- Steve?

141
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,411
- It's a pretty name.
- Steve sounds nice.

142
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:56,153
- I'm a lot less scared of Steve.
- Oh, great and powerful Steve!

143
00:12:56,227 --> 00:12:59,594
- What do you want?
- I don't think it can speak.

144
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:01,131
I heard that, young man!

145
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,865
- You get over here right now!
- OK.

146
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:06,233
Hammy, get back here.

147
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:09,137
- Steve is angry!
- It came from the other side of Steve.

148
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,004
I mean the bush. I mean... Jeez!

149
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,274
There's only one way
we're gonna find out what this thing is,

150
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:20,078
and what this is all about.
I'm gonna go check it out.

151
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,724
Steve ate Verne!

152
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:34,788
All right, Steve,
you brought this on yourself.

153
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:39,097
Stella, don't!
I'm not eaten, I just tripped.

154
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:44,001
I'm gonna go over there.
Just don't anybody move.

155
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:57,246
Kids, come on, hurry up! You'll be late!

156
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:12,602
What is this place?

157
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:26,812
Oh, hey there, little...

158
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:28,579
...fella.

159
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:36,288
Hi.

160
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,631
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

161
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,191
Operator. Can I help you?

162
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,127
No, I can talk. I'm just driving.

163
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:32,371
Verne's back.

164
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,508
- Verne!
- Jeepers!

165
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,484
- You OK?
- Help him up.

166
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:38,545
- What was over there?
- Freaky pink primates!

167
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:41,682
They must have come while
we were hibernating. It was awful.

168
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,853
They had wheels on their feet
and these sticks, and they were

169
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:48,228
whacking me with these sticks
like it was some sort of sick game.

170
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:51,860
You should have died!
You should have laid down and died.

171
00:15:51,936 --> 00:15:53,904
- Dad.
- That's not the worst part.

172
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:55,802
Half the forest is gone.

173
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,072
The oak trees and the berry bushes,

174
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:02,135
they're just... they're just gone.

175
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,612
Jeepers.

176
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:05,114
What'll we do for food?

177
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:07,514
How are we gonna live?

178
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,554
I don't know.
But here's what I do know.

179
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:15,422
We will be fine as long
as no one goes over Steve again.

180
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:20,260
It's called a hedge, and it is not
to be feared, my amphibious friend.

181
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:23,425
It is the gateway to the good life.

182
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:25,435
I'm a reptile, actually.

183
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:27,562
But, you know, it's a common mistake.

184
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,435
And you are?

185
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:32,908
Where are my manners. I'm RJ.

186
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,036
Don't think I'm prying,
but I couldn't help overhearing,

187
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:40,277
and I can shed a little light on what
this whole hedge situation is about.

188
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:42,683
You see, what was once mere wilderness

189
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:47,383
is now 54 acres of man-made,
manicured, air-conditioned paradise.

190
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,723
Except for that little-bitty speck.
You are here.

191
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:54,155
No, no, that's a good thing.
You're hibernators, right?

192
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,665
You gather food,
store it for the winter?

193
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:58,668
- We fill the log!
- Hammy.

194
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:01,830
Really? This log? This cave-like log?

195
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:04,773
- All the way to the top.
- Ozzie.

196
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:06,707
Let me ask ya, how long's it take?

197
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:10,269
- You know, to fill the log?
- Two hundred and seventy-four days.

198
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,845
- Ever done it in a week?
- That's impossible.

199
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:15,180
Not if we work together.

200
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:18,415
You've got the food gathering skills,
I've got the know-how,

201
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:20,719
- and they have the food!
- How much food?

202
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,283
Loads of food. Heaps of food.
Food out the wazoo!

203
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,829
Well, whatever kind of food
comes out of a wazoo,

204
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:28,990
I don't think
we're interested in eating.

205
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,500
I don't know,
the guy's making a lot of sense to me.

206
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:34,697
- I think we should listen.
- Yeah, I'm OK with wazoo food there.

207
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:37,832
No, you're not. The tail is tingling.

208
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:41,469
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hold on, hold on. The what is what?

209
00:17:41,545 --> 00:17:44,776
When something doesn't feel right,
my tail tingles. Let me tell you,

210
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:47,578
everything you've said so far
is driving my tail crazy.

211
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:51,644
Listen. Verne, right? This isn't
something you need to be afraid of.

212
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:55,214
Well, I am. And for good reason.

213
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:56,691
This is not a birthmark.

214
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,490
That's because you
went over there without a guide.

215
00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:02,031
Thanks for stopping by.
We're not interested.

216
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,535
Not interested in the most
delicious food you've ever tasted?

217
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:06,592
- No!
- Come on.

218
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,730
Not interested!

219
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:12,605
OK. I get it.

220
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:17,477
I understand. This is something
that you're just not open to.

221
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:27,287
Whoa!

222
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:29,155
- Oh, my!
- Jeepers.

223
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:31,353
What is that?

224
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:34,226
That, my friend, is a magical
combination of corn flour,

225
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:38,997
dehydrated cheese solids,
BHA, BHT and good old MSG,

226
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:42,971
a.k.a., the chip. Nacho cheese flavor.

227
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:46,271
- Over here! Toss me one of those!
- More please! More.

228
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:48,538
Yeah, Verne, those were good!

229
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:51,274
It's all good.
And we're going over there. Tonight!

230
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:54,283
Yeah!

231
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:55,567
Welcome to suburbia.

232
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:56,783
Welcome to suburbia.

233
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,287
- Wow!
- Look at that!

234
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:04,553
Hey, Mom, look at us! Look at us!

235
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:07,563
Oh, my! Hon, look at this.

236
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:09,223
Jeepers.

237
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,460
How's that tail, Verne?

238
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:14,937
Listen, if anybody in this family
gets hurt, I'm holding you responsible.

239
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:19,135
They're having a good time.
I'll take responsibility for that.

240
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:20,676
- This is neat.
- Look at that.

241
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,678
- Hey, Spike, look at that.
- Hey, Verno,

242
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,977
I took a few clippings out of my quills
to do a little comparison.

243
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,349
Look at this, the grass
seems to be greener over here.

244
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,980
Verne, are you certain
you came to the same place?

245
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:33,853
Yeah, 'cause the raccoon says...

246
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,290
OK, enough about him. I get it.

247
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,023
So he can do a couple of tricks. I mean,
it's not like he can walk on water.

248
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,827
Hey, everybody! This way to the food!

249
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,134
- That thing's huge!
- What is that?

250
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:50,230
That is an SUV.
Humans ride around in it

251
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:53,140
because they are slowly
losing their ability to walk.

252
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,509
- Jeepers, it's so big!
- How many humans fit in there?

253
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,242
Usually? One.

254
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,874
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp.
Your president?

255
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,046
Of the homeowner's association? Right.

256
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,487
- Jeepers.
- What is that?

257
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:09,993
Easy, easy, don't worry.
That's just a human being.

258
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,858
And they are just as scared of us
as we are of them.

259
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,161
Now, if a human does
happen to see you, just lay down,

260
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:20,067
roll over and give your privates
a good licking. They love it.

261
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:23,766
The charter, which you signed, says
the grass is supposed to be two inches,

262
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:27,402
and according to my measuring stick,
yours is 2.5.

263
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:31,676
Could we just get the food and go?
Really, do they have it or not?

264
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:35,583
Didn't you see it? It was in the box.
They've always got food with them.

265
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:39,588
We eat to live, these guys live to eat.

266
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,715
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

267
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:44,386
The human mouth is called a "pie hole."

268
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:47,055
The human being
is called a "couch potato."

269
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:49,691
That is a device to summon food.

270
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:53,066
That is one of the many voices of food.

271
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:55,662
That is the portal
for the passing of the food.

272
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:59,072
That is one of the many
food transportation vehicles.

273
00:20:59,143 --> 00:21:01,475
Humans bring the food, take the food,

274
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:03,979
ship the food, they drive the food,

275
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:08,245
they wear the food! That gets
the food hot. That keeps the food cold.

276
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:10,843
That... I'm not sure what that is.

277
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:14,923
What do you know? Food!

278
00:21:14,992 --> 00:21:18,621
That is the altar
where they worship food.

279
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,061
That's what they eat
when they eat too much.

280
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:23,622
That gets rid of guilt
so they can eat more food.

281
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,464
Food! Food! Food! Food!

282
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,266
Food!

283
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:30,704
So you think they have enough?

284
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:35,578
Well, they don't.
For humans, enough is never enough!

285
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:39,411
And what do they do
with the stuff they don't eat?

286
00:21:39,483 --> 00:21:43,783
They put it in gleaming, silver cans,

287
00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:45,116
just for us.

288
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:49,755
Sweetjeepers.

289
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:51,385
Dig in!

290
00:21:53,797 --> 00:21:56,288
- Good, isn't it?
- OK.

291
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:59,858
- Wow.
- Share there, everyone, share.

292
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:05,272
That's a diaper.
And that does come out of a wazoo.

293
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:10,208
So, what do you think?
Was I right or was I right?

294
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,339
And these things are just the scraps!

295
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,544
Wait'll you see what comes
in the boxes, packages and cans!

296
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:18,179
I'm telling you, stick with me,
and in one week

297
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,689
we will gather enough food to...

298
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,248
- To feed a bear.
- What?

299
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:25,557
Just a figure of speech.

300
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,723
Halt! Intruders! Intruders!
Get out, all of you.

301
00:22:31,802 --> 00:22:33,326
What is it, baby?

302
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:37,799
- What are you doing?
- You said to lick our...

303
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,639
No! Nix that! Run!

304
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:42,008
- Run!
- Get outta here!

305
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,478
Run!

306
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:46,213
- Shoo!
- To the hedge!

307
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:49,218
Get out of here!
I just mopped this patio!

308
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,617
Filthy vermin!

309
00:22:55,526 --> 00:22:57,289
Verne's right, that was horrible.

310
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:58,988
- You kids OK?
- Stay close.

311
00:22:59,062 --> 00:23:03,021
- We'll find other food, right?
- See? That's what I was talking about!

312
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,159
These humans don't want us around.

313
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:08,466
So we scared her,
and she overreacted. No biggie.

314
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:11,702
No biggie?
That is what we call a biggie.

315
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:14,903
Come on, think about the food.
It was worth it for that food, huh?

316
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,639
That stuff is to die for!

317
00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:20,147
Let me rephrase that.

318
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:23,209
No, to die for. You nailed that part.

319
00:23:23,287 --> 00:23:27,223
Look, maybe our little forest life
looks primitive to a guy with a bag.

320
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,758
- What?
- But I think I speak

321
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,293
for the whole family
when I say we want nothing

322
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:34,091
to do with anything
that's over that hedge.

323
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,596
- Oh, come on!
- I'm done.

324
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:41,035
You haven't even tried doughnuts yet!
You wanna store fat?

325
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:45,564
That is the way to store some fat.
You'll be sweatin' through the winter!

326
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:49,772
- We'll eat the bark, right?
- OK, all right, you guys sleep on it!

327
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,974
Good idea.
I'm gonna check back with you.

328
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,576
Shoot!

329
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:58,382
Almost had 'em.

330
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:06,959
- Good night, Heather.
- Good night.

331
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,588
- Good night, Ozzie.
- Good night.

332
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:10,132
- Good night, Lou.
- Good night.

333
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,599
- Night, Penny.
- Good night.

334
00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:13,226
- Good night, Hammy.
- Good night.

335
00:24:13,303 --> 00:24:14,634
- Night, Bucky.
- Good night.

336
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:16,900
- Good night, Spike.
- Good night, Uncle Verne.

337
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:19,033
- Good night, Quillo.
- Night, Uncle Verne.

338
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:21,543
When we wake up,
only 273 days left till winter.

339
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:24,843
- That's enough, Verne.
- Good night, 273.

340
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:29,481
Spuddies...

341
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:33,216
Cooler... Wagon... Redder wagon.

342
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,756
Time's up, RJ.

343
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:38,920
But I have six more days! No!

344
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,058
OK. Four paws, fur.

345
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:49,333
Still alive, still alive.

346
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,375
So, what are you saying?
You want me to take 'em to his house?

347
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:54,000
- No.
- Then what are you saying?

348
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,011
Jimmy was pushing me on the bus.

349
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,479
- He likes you.
- No way, he's a creep.

350
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:00,516
Next time he shoves you, beat him up.

351
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:02,345
Yes!

352
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:10,349
OK, kids, dive in. There it is.
Bark for breakfast!

353
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:13,260
- I want a doughnut!
- I want pizza.

354
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,661
No, you don't.

355
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:34,907
OK. This is great.

356
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:43,224
Granted, it takes some time to chew.

357
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,921
But that...

358
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:48,157
That was very satisfying.

359
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:51,496
And, by the way,
lots of fiber in there too.

360
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:57,134
- Lots.
- I gotta admit, that does look tasty.

361
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,168
What are you doing here?

362
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:02,541
I'm here to help you with your...
foraging thing.

363
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:07,750
Look, Verne, you said a word
yesterday about your little gang here.

364
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:10,150
It starts with an F,
do you remember what it was?

365
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:13,189
- Family?
- Right, right, that.

366
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:15,520
You know, that got me right here.

367
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:17,822
You see, Verne,
I used to have all of that.

368
00:26:17,894 --> 00:26:21,660
My own place, surrounded by loved ones,

369
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:23,427
universal remote.

370
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,968
But then all that went away with...

371
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:28,027
...the weed hacker incident.

372
00:26:28,105 --> 00:26:29,094
Oh, God.

373
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,163
Oh, come here.

374
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:34,603
Yeah, that feels good, doesn't it?

375
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,839
- Oh, brother.
- Jeepers, Verne.

376
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:39,381
We could always use
the extra hand there, you know.

377
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:43,249
The weed hacker, Verne.
The weed hacker.

378
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,254
OK.

379
00:26:45,322 --> 00:26:48,382
Not your problem. I'll just go.

380
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,020
This is me...

381
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:53,222
...going.

382
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:54,695
- Been nice.
- Don't hit.

383
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:56,460
Really nice getting to know you.

384
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,229
Hey, I'm sure I'll see you
around the forest.

385
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:01,736
- Take care.
- All right, all right.

386
00:27:01,805 --> 00:27:04,569
Hey, RJ?

387
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:06,700
You can... you can stay.

388
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:09,603
- Come here, ya big lug!
- No.

389
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,977
I knew beneath this hard,
crispy outside

390
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,209
there was a soft,
nougat-y center in there.

391
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:17,947
- Do you mind if I call you Uncle Verne?
- With every bone in my body.

392
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:20,387
Great. Hey, can I work with Hammy?

393
00:27:21,158 --> 00:27:23,126
Wanna help me find my nuts?

394
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:27,721
Very tempting, Hammy, very tempting.
But first, I want to show you this.

395
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,727
You like this cookie?

396
00:27:31,802 --> 00:27:34,270
- Well, this cookie's junk!
- I like a cookie.

397
00:27:34,337 --> 00:27:35,770
Easy, easy. Don't worry.

398
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,307
I know where we can get
some cookies so valuable

399
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:43,312
that they are hand delivered
by uniformed officers.

400
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,914
- The Doyles' is the yellow house.
- They only ordered one box.

401
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:46,449
- The Doyles' is the yellow house.
- They only ordered one box.

402
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:48,848
There they are.
America's most coveted cookies.

403
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,685
Love Handles, Skinny Mints,
Neener Neeners and Smackeroons.

404
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,850
And guess what? They're all yours!

405
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:59,054
Whoa, Hamilton. Hold on there, fella.

406
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:01,290
I love your energy,
but you can't take 'em.

407
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:03,355
- You said they're mine.
- They will be,

408
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:07,665
if we successfully marry your
manic energy to my brilliant plan!

409
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:09,534
- You with me, kid?
- I... I... I...

410
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,369
The I's have it! Let's ride.

411
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,966
Mrs. Johansson
was allergic to chocolate.

412
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:16,035
- Really?
- Yeah, if she eats it,

413
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:20,048
- her face explodes or something.
- That is, like, so unfair.

414
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,209
- Wait, wait. How many boxes of...?
- Hey!

415
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:25,118
You stay away from those cookies.
They're mine!

416
00:28:26,556 --> 00:28:29,320
This guy's not coming, is he?
I don't want him to.

417
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:31,986
Oh, we have so much work to do.

418
00:28:32,062 --> 00:28:34,656
Come on, step into my office.
Now, listen up.

419
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:38,394
What we're going for here is
a vicious, man-eating, rabid squirrel.

420
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,333
- Can you handle that?
- Excuse me?

421
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:42,633
Yes... Hammy.

422
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:46,699
OK. Rabbits aren't vicious.
They're all cute and cuddly, so...

423
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:49,176
Rabid, not rabbit.

424
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:51,407
Oh... What?

425
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,746
OK. So first we're gonna muss the hair.

426
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,548
That's looking good.
All right, now we're gonna...

427
00:28:57,621 --> 00:28:59,612
We're gonna mat the fur a little bit.

428
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:02,283
A little puff on the tail...
Stop it! Puffier.

429
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,621
Liking that a lot.

430
00:29:03,693 --> 00:29:05,991
Show me that wild look in your eye.
Come on!

431
00:29:07,697 --> 00:29:11,497
- I can burp my ABCs! A, B, C.
- Hammy!

432
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:16,403
I just really need you
to focus right now, OK?

433
00:29:16,473 --> 00:29:17,462
- OK.
- Thank you.

434
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,804
Let's see. There we... Hang on a minute.

435
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:22,470
Not that, not that. No, no.

436
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,111
Nice!

437
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,381
Hammy?

438
00:29:33,323 --> 00:29:35,917
Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.

439
00:29:35,992 --> 00:29:39,155
Go on, get out there. Shoo, shoo!

440
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:43,962
I am a crazy rabid squirrel!
I want my cookies!

441
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:49,194
I'm rabid! I'm foaming at the mouth.

442
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:52,935
I'm foaming, very scary rabid squirrel.

443
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:54,499
Rabies!

444
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:56,408
- Hey, it's working!
- Behind you!

445
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:58,208
I know. You're right behind me...

446
00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:00,977
Got it! Stand back!

447
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:03,485
- No, no, no, no! Oh, no!
- Take that!

448
00:30:04,487 --> 00:30:07,650
- Walk it off! Walk that one off!
- What's going on? Is that Hammy?

449
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:11,057
- Everything's under control. Go back.
- You call that under control?

450
00:30:11,127 --> 00:30:12,992
- He's under attack!
- He's working!

451
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,258
- I'm coming, Hammy!
- Verne! No!

452
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:17,266
What are you doing? Watch out!

453
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,941
- Hold still! I got it! Stay still.
- Help me! Get off of me!

454
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:30,642
- Yuck!
- Gross!

455
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:33,376
- Nasty!
- Oh, my God, this is so gross!

456
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,508
Verne!

457
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:37,985
That was great!
You, my friend, are a natural.

458
00:30:38,054 --> 00:30:41,854
Or, should I say, au naturel.

459
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,255
Hammy, you were awesome, my man!

460
00:30:49,332 --> 00:30:53,291
You had me scared. I was about to come
out and beat you with a book myself.

461
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,897
You're all right, aren't ya?
Of course you are. You are Hammy!

462
00:30:56,973 --> 00:31:00,238
Those bruises are gonna heal.
You know what? Chicks dig scars.

463
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,335
- There!
- Over there!

464
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:05,779
That's where the squirrel attacked us!
He has rabies or something.

465
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:08,215
There was this gross,
naked, amphibian thing.

466
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:11,253
- Reptile.
- It's OK, girls.

467
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:14,381
Go inside, have a cookie,
turn on the TV and calm down.

468
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:15,446
Thanks, Mom.

469
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:19,518
I'm sorry, Janis, did I
just hear them say "rabid squirrel"?

470
00:31:19,596 --> 00:31:21,757
I think they might just be overreacting.

471
00:31:21,831 --> 00:31:25,232
What if they're not? What if we have
a potential pandemic on our hands?

472
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,633
Vermin running loose, spreading disease

473
00:31:27,704 --> 00:31:31,196
and lowering our property values?

474
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:34,573
Yeah. I have a casserole
in the oven. Gotta run.

475
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:36,635
Fine. Worry about your casserole,

476
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:41,082
and I'll worry about the end
of suburban peace and tranquility!

477
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,489
That's right. Don't push.
Plenty for everybody.

478
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:48,751
Got a box right over here for ya,
Penny.

479
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:53,524
That is good. Eat up! Anything that
tastes this good has to be good for you.

480
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:56,895
Feel buzzing in the back of your skull?
That's called a sugar rush.

481
00:31:56,966 --> 00:32:01,494
It's what keeps humans going, why they
don't hibernate. Add a little of this,

482
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:05,302
and what usually takes you
all summer will take us a week.

483
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,933
I like it! I like it!

484
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,413
Hold on, Hamsquad.
The last thing you need is caffeine.

485
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:14,978
That's right. Come on, dig in.

486
00:32:15,051 --> 00:32:18,179
Because this, my friends,
is just the beginning.

487
00:32:18,254 --> 00:32:19,983
What?

488
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:44,542
- Up, down! Up, down!
- He's getting away!

489
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:46,343
Oh, yeah!

490
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,672
Read it and weep.

491
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:43,864
Hello? I need every business listing
you have under "exterminator."

492
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,270
Ozzie!

493
00:34:17,273 --> 00:34:19,935
- Whoa, Mom! You hit a possum.
- Oh, my goodness.

494
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:21,237
Do you think it's dead?

495
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,245
Oh, no.

496
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:25,304
- Wow!
- Touch it.

497
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:27,110
- Can I poke him?
- No!

498
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:29,276
These poor little creatures.

499
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:31,912
- What's going on?
- Come check it out.

500
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:35,719
Debbie? I don't remember seeing
a permit app for a gathering.

501
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:38,386
Groups of more than one
who wish to get...

502
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:41,157
Timmy, get the shovel from the car.

503
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,834
Lights fading, limbs growing cold.

504
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:51,965
- I see a tunnel.
- Oh, no.

505
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:59,145
Mother, is that you
beckoning me into the light?

506
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:01,183
Must move toward the light.

507
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:05,787
- What do you think he's doing?
- Maybe we knocked his brains loose.

508
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:09,120
You went too far.
Let's get out of here and leave this...

509
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:10,853
This...

510
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:13,896
- Nice catch, Verne.
- Yes! Yes!

511
00:35:13,963 --> 00:35:18,400
- You're dangerous. You're insane!
- Sweet music, I'm going home!

512
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:23,766
Goodbye, cruel world!

513
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:29,340
Rosebud.

514
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:36,412
- Now can I poke him?
- No!

515
00:35:36,486 --> 00:35:39,978
You see? This is exactly why
I called the exterminator.

516
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:42,490
To kill them
before they get hurt like this.

517
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:44,549
Everybody, get out of here right now!

518
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:46,959
Right! Kids, grab those handles.
Get the stuff.

519
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,295
- What?
- Here we go. I threw out my back.

520
00:35:53,636 --> 00:35:55,467
- Let's go.
- Get down.

521
00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:13,754
Oh, no.

522
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:23,392
I believe someone phoned
about an animal problem?

523
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:26,196
The solution is standing before you.

524
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:29,705
Dwayne LaFontant is here.

525
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:33,708
Where have you been? I'm throwing
a "Welcome to the Neighborhood" party,

526
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:37,041
and so far Debbie's car has killed
more animals than you have.

527
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:39,274
Stand down, sister.

528
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:43,979
I personally guarantee that there will
not be a living thing at this party.

529
00:36:44,053 --> 00:36:46,214
The Verminator is on the job.

530
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,523
Leave it. Leave it!

531
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:51,423
What do we have here?

532
00:36:52,095 --> 00:36:54,689
Didelphis marsupialis virginianus.

533
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:57,158
Approximately ten pounds.

534
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:00,827
Male.

535
00:37:00,903 --> 00:37:02,768
- I think he's dead.
- Oh, really?

536
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:06,331
Do you, in fact, have an
associates degree from Vermtech?

537
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:08,377
I think he wants you to think he's dead.

538
00:37:08,444 --> 00:37:10,071
- Go! Go!
- Move, move!

539
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:12,774
- That's it! Run! Go!
...voluntary shock state.

540
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:15,511
Look at him closely.
You can see him breathing.

541
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:18,645
I certainly hope he's not in any pain.

542
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:20,018
What the...?

543
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:21,556
Kill it! Kill it!

544
00:37:21,624 --> 00:37:24,024
Thank you all for coming!
You were a great audience!

545
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:25,856
Oh, man!

546
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,364
All right, what am I up against here?

547
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:34,597
Possum, porcupine, skunk, squirrel,

548
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,764
raccoon, amphibian.

549
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,173
- Reptile.
- No.

550
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:43,075
Reptile.

551
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:49,450
That's what I call
a super-duper performance there.

552
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,316
- I wanna do it again!
- Beyond super.

553
00:37:51,387 --> 00:37:53,287
They were riveted. You were awesome!

554
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:55,916
All right!

555
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:59,792
Dad. I just gotta say,
that was... that was pretty good.

556
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:03,423
Props for the Ozman!

557
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:05,694
- Ozman!
- Yeah! Yeah!

558
00:38:05,768 --> 00:38:08,532
But let's not forget
our brilliant leadership:

559
00:38:08,604 --> 00:38:10,196
RJ.

560
00:38:10,273 --> 00:38:11,399
RJ!

561
00:38:11,474 --> 00:38:13,408
Brilliant!

562
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:16,934
RJ, come this way.
We wanna show you something.

563
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,276
- Yeah, sure.
- Sweet.

564
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:21,873
- What a team!
- That raccoon knows what he's doing.

565
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:24,419
You're my hero there, fella.

566
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:30,253
- Over here, this way.
- RJ, come on!

567
00:38:30,326 --> 00:38:32,886
Yeah, we wanna show you something.
Come on, hurry!

568
00:38:32,962 --> 00:38:35,487
Check it out.

569
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:40,297
Your new home!

570
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:46,871
And look,
we got a place for you right here!

571
00:38:47,944 --> 00:38:49,241
That's for me?

572
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:53,942
Yeah, is this anything
like what you had, RJ?

573
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:56,348
This isn't anything
like what I had, Lou.

574
00:38:57,487 --> 00:39:00,752
- Here, I'm not supposed to drink this.
- Thanks.

575
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:04,918
- Is that my bag?
- Yeah, we brought it in here

576
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:07,019
so you wouldn't have
to sleep in that tree.

577
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:09,530
Really? Wow.

578
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,534
Hey, RJ, check this out!
We totally hooked up the TV.

579
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:17,005
- I hot-wired the HD converter.
- We get a thousand channels!

580
00:39:17,073 --> 00:39:19,234
Can you take the remote
before my dad does?

581
00:39:19,308 --> 00:39:22,402
Wow. A universal remote?

582
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,572
This is nice, guys. Really nice.

583
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:31,815
We now return to A Scoundrel Among Us.

584
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:33,719
You should be ashamed of yourself.

585
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,451
We let you into our family,
and you've deceived us.

586
00:39:36,526 --> 00:39:40,656
I gave you my heart, and you
ripped it into a million pieces.

587
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:45,690
Get real, Kevin. When you feel like a
dirtbag, it's because you're a dirtbag.

588
00:39:45,768 --> 00:39:50,637
Right? So just own it,
just say it out loud. "I am a dirtbag."

589
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:54,267
Dirtbag.
I don't think that guy's a real doctor.

590
00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:57,278
What do you think there, RJ? RJ?

591
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:03,082
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, RJ.

592
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:07,145
What are you doing, man?
You are getting in way too deep.

593
00:40:07,223 --> 00:40:08,622
Just get the food.

594
00:40:08,691 --> 00:40:10,818
Feed the bear. Get the food.

595
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:12,520
Feed the bear.

596
00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:15,029
Where's the food? Where's the food?!

597
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:25,605
Verne. What are you doing?

598
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:27,836
Getting things back
to the way they were.

599
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,310
- No, don't. How about I just leave?
- Good.

600
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:33,280
You leave, and I return
this stuff to the rightful owners.

601
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:35,044
What?! Why?

602
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:37,642
Because we've angered the humans.

603
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,120
And we don't wanna end up
like that rabbit.

604
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:44,853
Hence, I'm giving this back
so they won't kill us.

605
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:48,693
Verne, you don't understand!
We need this stuff!

606
00:40:48,764 --> 00:40:50,356
No, we don't!

607
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:52,594
You can't take it!

608
00:40:52,668 --> 00:40:53,726
Yes, I can!

609
00:40:53,803 --> 00:40:55,930
- Let go!
- You let go!

610
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:58,064
- I have to have it.
- No!

611
00:41:11,621 --> 00:41:15,216
Verne. Move slow,
keep your voice low and follow me.

612
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:16,519
What?

613
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:19,787
No.

614
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:25,693
No. I'm not falling
for any more of your smooth talk!

615
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:29,829
I don't know what you're up to,
but my entire shell is tingling.

616
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,100
Know what?
I'm listening to it this time,

617
00:41:32,174 --> 00:41:34,904
- and I'm putting my foot down.
- No, no.

618
00:41:35,678 --> 00:41:37,441
Play?

619
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,141
Play!

620
00:41:42,785 --> 00:41:44,275
Play! Play! Play!

621
00:41:44,353 --> 00:41:45,980
Play! Play! Play! Play! Play!

622
00:41:50,192 --> 00:41:52,126
Play!

623
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:01,363
Let's play!

624
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,637
Play!

625
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,141
Jeez...

626
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:10,645
Play! Play! Play! Play! Play! Play!

627
00:42:10,713 --> 00:42:13,705
- Down, boy. Sit. Roll over!
- Play!

628
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,250
- Play dead!
- Play!

629
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:21,112
Attaboy, Verne. Save the food.
I'll lose the dog.

630
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,214
Play.

631
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:23,781
Play, play, play, play.

632
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:29,161
Play, play, play, play.

633
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:31,199
Oh, no! No, no, no, no.

634
00:42:33,169 --> 00:42:35,399
You're dropping all the food, man!

635
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:37,701
- Here, catch.
- Play!

636
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:40,605
Are you hungry? Look, food.

637
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:45,144
Oh, my back!

638
00:42:45,614 --> 00:42:47,775
Look, people! Play with them!

639
00:42:48,184 --> 00:42:49,879
- Look out!
- Stop! What's he doing?

640
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:52,318
- What was that?
- Play, play, play, play.

641
00:42:53,255 --> 00:42:56,247
I'm all right,
I'm fine. It's OK. It's...

642
00:43:00,129 --> 00:43:02,154
Verne, unhook the chain.

643
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:06,564
Play!

644
00:43:09,972 --> 00:43:11,166
No.

645
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,229
Yes.

646
00:43:12,908 --> 00:43:14,205
Bad.

647
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:17,211
Oh, boy.

648
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:28,648
Verne, I told you to unhook the chain.

649
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:48,338
Garbage cans are not to be
on the curb before eight...

650
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:05,554
You're the devil.

651
00:44:21,877 --> 00:44:24,471
No! No!

652
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:26,139
Verne, you all right there?

653
00:44:26,215 --> 00:44:28,513
- Gimme a hand, Oz.
- Sure, sure.

654
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,245
- What happened?
- What happened?

655
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,811
It's gone. The food! Gone!

656
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:35,049
- What?
- Gone?

657
00:44:35,124 --> 00:44:38,525
- How's it gone?
- Ask him!

658
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:41,688
- Verne?
- I returned it

659
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:44,164
- to its rightful owner.
- What?

660
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:46,701
We, like, worked
our tails off, you know?

661
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:49,932
Like, a lot. And the food
we gathered was totally...

662
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:52,997
You know. And you're...
You're all, whatever.

663
00:44:53,075 --> 00:44:56,203
Yeah, Verne, what were you thinking?
The log was full!

664
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:58,974
- Full of junk.
- So, what are you saying there?

665
00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:03,849
That the food we gather our way isn't as
good as the food we gather your way?

666
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:06,149
Your way? You mean his way.

667
00:45:06,222 --> 00:45:08,349
Can't you see RJ is just using you?

668
00:45:08,424 --> 00:45:12,190
Verne! Shame on you.
RJ wouldn't do that.

669
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:15,059
You have got to trust me on this.
Don't you understand

670
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,859
there's something wrong with him?

671
00:45:16,932 --> 00:45:19,662
My tail tingles
every time I get near him.

672
00:45:19,735 --> 00:45:23,034
So we're supposed to go hungry
because your butt's vibrating?

673
00:45:23,105 --> 00:45:26,666
I'm starting to think that tingle
is just you being jealous.

674
00:45:26,742 --> 00:45:29,176
- Jealous? Of him?
- Yeah.

675
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:32,737
He's embracing the future there,
and you're just holding us back.

676
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:35,306
I hold you back, all right.
From extinction.

677
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:36,749
See what you've done here?

678
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:39,515
If they listened to half the stuff
you're telling them,

679
00:45:39,588 --> 00:45:43,319
they'll be dead within a week. You are
only interested in taking advantage

680
00:45:43,392 --> 00:45:47,294
because they're too stupid
and naive to know any better.

681
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,964
I'm not stupid.

682
00:45:54,837 --> 00:45:57,806
OK, I didn't mean...

683
00:45:57,873 --> 00:45:59,773
I meant ignorant.

684
00:46:01,577 --> 00:46:03,772
To the ways over... over there.

685
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:08,109
Come on, you guys.
You know I didn't mean it like that.

686
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:09,810
Don't... don't do this.

687
00:46:09,885 --> 00:46:12,581
Stella? Ozzie?

688
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:16,883
Hammy? You know I didn't...

689
00:46:18,594 --> 00:46:22,155
- Hammy...
- I'm not stupid.

690
00:46:22,798 --> 00:46:25,358
Please.

691
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,446
- Good night, Uncle RJ.
- Good night, kiddo.

692
00:47:20,022 --> 00:47:24,254
Moon's full, RJ. See ya in the morning.

693
00:47:53,522 --> 00:47:56,514
This'll cut you down to size!

694
00:48:00,195 --> 00:48:01,184
I got ya!

695
00:48:08,203 --> 00:48:10,763
- Is it done?
- Affirmative.

696
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:13,239
Did you put this one in?
This Depelter Turbo?

697
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:18,871
That's a contraband item, ma'am, as it
is illegal in every state, except Texas.

698
00:48:18,947 --> 00:48:21,507
I don't care if it's
against the Geneva Convention.

699
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:24,381
- I want it!
- I thought you might.

700
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:27,445
So I took the liberty
of installing it for you.

701
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,017
Adios, animal infestation.

702
00:48:36,698 --> 00:48:38,598
Oh, my.

703
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,150
What have I done?

704
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:01,922
- Shouldn't have taken all that food.
- What?

705
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,890
I shouldn't have taken all that food.

706
00:49:03,959 --> 00:49:07,019
I was just trying to return
things to the way they were.

707
00:49:07,096 --> 00:49:09,826
I was just being cautious.
'Cause that's what I am.

708
00:49:09,898 --> 00:49:11,991
I'm naturally tentative.

709
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:14,558
There's even places in my shell
I haven't been.

710
00:49:14,636 --> 00:49:16,900
You, on the other hand,
you're like... cool.

711
00:49:16,972 --> 00:49:19,941
And crazy and fearless.

712
00:49:20,008 --> 00:49:22,772
I think they're right.
I think I'm just jealous.

713
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:28,048
Verne, believe me,
you should not be jealous of me.

714
00:49:28,984 --> 00:49:32,613
You got a good thing here. You're trying
to do what's best for your family.

715
00:49:32,688 --> 00:49:34,986
And I think you're
what's best for them now.

716
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,055
What about your tail?

717
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:43,327
My head says listen to my tail, my tail
says listen to my head, and I just...

718
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:45,764
...end up with an upset stomach.

719
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:48,132
That's why you need
to be in charge now.

720
00:49:48,203 --> 00:49:51,229
- You don't know what's going on.
- And you do.

721
00:49:51,306 --> 00:49:54,469
- So, what's the problem?
- This, Verne, is the problem.

722
00:49:54,543 --> 00:49:57,034
- You see this?
- I'm listening.

723
00:49:57,112 --> 00:49:58,636
Just...

724
00:49:58,714 --> 00:50:00,614
Just hang on a second. All right?

725
00:50:02,518 --> 00:50:03,507
I...

726
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:06,884
- You throwing the party?
- Yes. To the right.

727
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:09,856
There are protective booties
to put on over your shoes.

728
00:50:09,925 --> 00:50:13,326
Yes! Yes!

729
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:17,257
- What is this?
- What?

730
00:50:17,332 --> 00:50:20,028
Oh, that...

731
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:21,433
...is a...

732
00:50:21,503 --> 00:50:24,165
...list of all the stuff
that you lost, Verne.

733
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:26,764
- Really?
- It's a big, long list. You can see.

734
00:50:26,842 --> 00:50:30,334
You're a... organized little guy,
aren't you? Nice job.

735
00:50:30,412 --> 00:50:33,006
You know what? I know a place
so chock-full of food,

736
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:34,981
we could get it all back in one night.

737
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:37,018
Great. Let's go. Where is it?

738
00:50:37,085 --> 00:50:39,315
- Inside that house.
- What?

739
00:50:42,191 --> 00:50:46,184
- What is the point of this thing?
- Just send it down.

740
00:50:46,261 --> 00:50:47,278
What Verne is trying to say is...

741
00:50:47,313 --> 00:50:48,295
What Verne is trying to say is...

742
00:50:48,363 --> 00:50:51,662
I mean, it's hard to really
sum it all up in just one word.

743
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:54,258
- But...
- I'm sorry.

744
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:56,965
Oh, come here.

745
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,133
- Oh, come here, Verne.
- That's right.

746
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:03,306
OK! Listen, stay in the huddle.
Here's the plan.

747
00:51:03,378 --> 00:51:08,247
Now, the traps are set here, here, here,

748
00:51:08,317 --> 00:51:11,980
here, here, here, here, here, here,

749
00:51:12,054 --> 00:51:17,048
here, here, here and here.

750
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:23,086
Here, here, here, here.

751
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:26,328
Big one here, here,

752
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:28,961
- and maybe a few over here.
- Gee, is that all?

753
00:51:29,037 --> 00:51:32,598
No. There's a bunch
of red lights all over here.

754
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:34,574
OK, Verne? Looking a little green.

755
00:51:34,643 --> 00:51:37,111
I blacked out for a second there,
but I get the idea.

756
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:40,114
There's lights, traps...
I might need to change my shell.

757
00:51:40,182 --> 00:51:43,083
OK, this is us.

758
00:51:43,151 --> 00:51:45,119
- Can I be the car?
- I wanna be the car!

759
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:48,486
- I'm the car. You be the shoe.
- The shoe is lame.

760
00:51:48,557 --> 00:51:51,219
Why don't you be
that snazzy-looking iron?

761
00:51:51,293 --> 00:51:52,555
Hey, it's not important!

762
00:51:52,628 --> 00:51:55,961
Besides, I'm the car.
I'm always the car.

763
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:59,432
The plan works in three simple steps.
Step one, kill the lights.

764
00:51:59,501 --> 00:52:03,301
Step two, get inside. Step three,
get out with mountain of food.

765
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:08,275
But this place is like a fortress.
Walls, so high. Doors, impenetrable.

766
00:52:08,343 --> 00:52:11,005
- How will we get in?
- The collar is the key.

767
00:52:12,514 --> 00:52:14,243
Literally, the collar.

768
00:52:14,316 --> 00:52:16,648
It's like a key
that opens the door and if...

769
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:20,085
And what? You think he's just
gonna hand over his collar to you?

770
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:22,385
Not to me, my femme fatale. To you.

771
00:52:22,457 --> 00:52:23,924
- Her?
- Me?

772
00:52:23,992 --> 00:52:27,587
You, Stella, will get that cat
to give you his collar by using...

773
00:52:27,663 --> 00:52:30,655
- My stink.
...your feminine charms.

774
00:52:31,466 --> 00:52:33,491
Was that out loud?

775
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:38,130
Look, raccoon, maybe that mask
you're wearing is obstructing your view,

776
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:41,266
but if you haven't noticed, I'm a skunk.

777
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:45,370
On the outside, maybe. But I'm looking
inside, Stella, and I see a fox.

778
00:52:45,447 --> 00:52:48,348
And all we gotta do is get her out.

779
00:52:53,288 --> 00:52:54,812
- Scissors.
- Scissors?

780
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,482
- Here we go.
- Watch the...

781
00:52:56,558 --> 00:52:58,423
- Charcoal.
- Charcoal?

782
00:52:59,895 --> 00:53:01,453
- Air freshener.
- Tomato juice.

783
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,862
- Cork.
- Cork? Don't you dare.

784
00:53:06,902 --> 00:53:09,564
- Get 'em!
- Score! Yeah!

785
00:53:12,808 --> 00:53:15,276
One more thing.

786
00:53:15,344 --> 00:53:17,141
Stop. That's it.

787
00:53:17,212 --> 00:53:20,477
Ladies and gentlemen,
our work here is done.

788
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,615
Oh, my.

789
00:53:23,685 --> 00:53:27,212
- Big jeepers.
- She's all like, wow.

790
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:28,984
What?

791
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:40,032
Meow.

792
00:53:40,102 --> 00:53:41,967
- Whoa!
- Amazing!

793
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:44,028
Gosh, she looks...

794
00:53:44,106 --> 00:53:46,199
Wow.

795
00:53:51,246 --> 00:53:54,943
All right, gang, this is it.
We're going in.

796
00:54:02,524 --> 00:54:07,120
Not again. Dang it!
Those things are so lifelike.

797
00:54:07,195 --> 00:54:10,631
Curse you, plastic moldsman.

798
00:54:28,383 --> 00:54:29,975
OK, Hammy.

799
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:32,980
Hammy!

800
00:54:47,335 --> 00:54:50,827
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

801
00:54:50,906 --> 00:54:53,602
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

802
00:54:55,243 --> 00:54:57,643
Hammy, I told you that cookie's junk!

803
00:54:57,712 --> 00:54:59,509
But I like a cookie.

804
00:55:00,015 --> 00:55:02,916
What's going on? Is everything OK?

805
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:10,983
Here we go!

806
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:15,655
Come on, Hammy, come on. Follow the
pretty light. There it is, that's it.

807
00:55:17,365 --> 00:55:19,060
That's it, that's it.

808
00:55:19,134 --> 00:55:20,897
There it is. Go get it.

809
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:29,004
That's it, that's it.

810
00:55:31,046 --> 00:55:33,378
Go get it, you little nut!

811
00:55:34,049 --> 00:55:37,018
Bingo! OK, step two.

812
00:55:37,085 --> 00:55:39,849
I thought we'd be dead by step two,
so this is going great!

813
00:55:42,691 --> 00:55:44,921
OK, gorgeous, you're on.

814
00:55:47,295 --> 00:55:50,753
Man, this better be one stupid cat.

815
00:55:50,832 --> 00:55:52,424
Audio, go!

816
00:55:56,204 --> 00:55:57,762
She's supposed to be a cat.

817
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,672
Put it on cat.
Maybe the cat likes a cow.

818
00:56:00,742 --> 00:56:01,902
Who goes there?

819
00:56:03,044 --> 00:56:04,944
You're a cat! You're a cat!

820
00:56:05,013 --> 00:56:06,037
You're a cat!

821
00:56:07,215 --> 00:56:09,410
I mean, I'm a cat.

822
00:56:09,484 --> 00:56:11,975
- Meow.
- Yeah, right.

823
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:14,146
Shoo. Go on, get away from here.

824
00:56:14,222 --> 00:56:17,316
My owner does not give scraps
to common strays.

825
00:56:17,392 --> 00:56:20,054
Common strays?
All right, you asked for it.

826
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:23,188
- Get the collar!
- Gee, that's a nice collar you got on.

827
00:56:23,265 --> 00:56:25,927
- Mind if I have a look?
- No! Come no closer!

828
00:56:26,001 --> 00:56:31,064
I must not be so near
a creature of the outdoor woods.

829
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:34,074
- Away with your filth!
- My filth?

830
00:56:34,676 --> 00:56:37,042
- My filth?!
- Oh, jeepers, here we go.

831
00:56:37,112 --> 00:56:40,946
OK, that's it. I am sick and tired
of everybody taking one look at me

832
00:56:41,016 --> 00:56:43,416
and running away
'cause they think I'm filthy.

833
00:56:43,485 --> 00:56:45,077
Well, I got news for you.

834
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:48,850
I didn't get all primped and preened
to have some over-fed, pompous puffball

835
00:56:48,924 --> 00:56:52,883
tell me he's too good for me.
I got makeup on my butt, dude!

836
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:55,191
And you don't even
wanna know about the cork!

837
00:56:55,263 --> 00:56:59,393
Stop! No one has ever
spoken to me like that!

838
00:57:01,736 --> 00:57:04,432
It is bold. I like it.

839
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:10,943
Well, believe me,
there's more where that came from...

840
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,240
...puffball.
- All right, team, let's boogie.

841
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:17,911
You are strong.
Your essence is overpowering.

842
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:20,921
- What...? What do you mean by that?
- It is your eyes.

843
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:24,652
- My eyes.
- They are luminous.

844
00:57:24,726 --> 00:57:27,786
Luminous? Dang.

845
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:30,456
You know, I think this
is the part where I blacked out.

846
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:33,831
Did the little shoes and cars
actually get into the house?

847
00:57:35,136 --> 00:57:37,764
- So you got a name?
- Yes.

848
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,774
It is a Persian name,
for I am Persian.

849
00:57:40,842 --> 00:57:44,505
I was born Prince
Tigeriess Mahmood Shabaz.

850
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:48,538
That's a mouthful.
Can I just call you Tiger?

851
00:57:50,085 --> 00:57:53,816
- This place is huge.
- Wicked cool.

852
00:57:54,656 --> 00:57:57,750
Animals are in the house.

853
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:08,130
Wow!

854
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:12,564
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is so cool.

855
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:16,304
- Yes! OK, stations, everybody.
- Let's boogie!

856
00:58:16,378 --> 00:58:17,504
- We got it.
- Here we go.

857
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:19,444
No grip, no grip, no grip.

858
00:58:20,482 --> 00:58:24,111
- Hammy! Less claw, more pad.
- Oh, OK.

859
00:58:24,686 --> 00:58:26,620
That hurt.

860
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:37,457
- Just a minute, I'll be right there.
- What was that?

861
00:58:37,532 --> 00:58:40,899
It... That's just the sound
of my heart. Can't you hear it?

862
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:49,175
This way, this way!

863
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:57,279
OK, OK, we're good. Go back to work.

864
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,184
There ya go.

865
00:59:00,255 --> 00:59:01,745
Here, catch!

866
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:09,358
Oh, boy.

867
00:59:10,865 --> 00:59:12,890
Yes, I'm gonna make it.

868
00:59:13,068 --> 00:59:16,367
My father, he had
an exceptionally flat face.

869
00:59:16,438 --> 00:59:19,601
He was so beautiful,
he could barely breathe.

870
00:59:19,674 --> 00:59:21,039
Fascinating.

871
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:25,102
...inside, I have a multi-leveled
climby-thing with shag carpet.

872
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,239
- Come, I show you.
- No, no!

873
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:28,907
I haven't told you about my life.

874
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:31,451
Good, good. Going great, going great.

875
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,079
What is that?

876
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:37,283
That is what gets the humans
out of bed in the morning.

877
00:59:39,794 --> 00:59:40,852
Where'd she go?

878
00:59:41,463 --> 00:59:42,896
Get down and stay down.

879
00:59:49,804 --> 00:59:51,635
Move. Move.

880
01:00:10,391 --> 01:00:13,121
Come on! We've gotta go
before she comes back.

881
01:00:14,763 --> 01:00:17,231
- No! Not without those Spuddies.
- What?

882
01:00:17,298 --> 01:00:20,859
Lou, Penny, back to the TV.
Heather, keep an eye on that human.

883
01:00:20,935 --> 01:00:23,165
- I'm on it, RJ.
- No, Heather. Wait!

884
01:00:23,238 --> 01:00:25,570
The tingle, the tingle.

885
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,972
RJ! The wagon's full,
let's get out of here.

886
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:30,033
Vincent, this'll only take a second

887
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:31,373
- Vincent?
- Where?

888
01:00:31,446 --> 01:00:33,846
- Who's Vincent?
- Oh, Verne, Vincent.

889
01:00:33,915 --> 01:00:36,884
Simple slip of the bear. Tongue!

890
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:41,149
Just bear with me
is what I meant to say.

891
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:42,849
There's no bear.

892
01:00:46,694 --> 01:00:49,993
Lights fading. Limbs growing co...

893
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,865
Heather.

894
01:01:01,509 --> 01:01:04,501
Oh, Heather!

895
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:07,571
There's a dead, white rat
on my staircase.

896
01:01:11,486 --> 01:01:13,215
I thought you were dead.

897
01:01:13,288 --> 01:01:15,222
I learned from the best, Dad.

898
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,622
That's my girl.

899
01:01:17,692 --> 01:01:19,751
Come to Papa.

900
01:01:19,828 --> 01:01:22,296
We better hurry.
We don't have much time.

901
01:01:22,363 --> 01:01:23,990
- What's going on, RJ?
- Nothing!

902
01:01:24,065 --> 01:01:26,431
Let's get out of here
because we have what we need.

903
01:01:26,501 --> 01:01:28,731
- No, we don't.
- What are you talking about?

904
01:01:28,803 --> 01:01:30,964
- We have more than enough.
- Hey, listen.

905
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:34,372
I've got this long to hand over that
wagon of food to a homicidal bear.

906
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:38,538
If these Spuddies aren't on the menu,
then I will be. Now let go of my tail.

907
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:40,376
What?

908
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:42,075
Let go!

909
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:47,052
Hey, whoa!

910
01:01:49,657 --> 01:01:51,215
I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

911
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:56,195
Stella, Stella,
where are you going? Stella!

912
01:02:00,935 --> 01:02:01,924
Stella!

913
01:02:02,003 --> 01:02:06,770
Look, it's not you.
It won't work, OK, because I'm a...

914
01:02:06,841 --> 01:02:08,570
Skunk!

915
01:02:08,643 --> 01:02:11,840
Yeah, that. Sorry you have to see this.

916
01:02:11,913 --> 01:02:12,937
Fire in the hole!

917
01:02:19,053 --> 01:02:21,783
- Oh, my...
- This smell doesn't bother you?

918
01:02:21,856 --> 01:02:25,019
No. This face was bred for beauty.

919
01:02:25,093 --> 01:02:26,754
I cannot smell a thing.

920
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:29,456
You can't smell?

921
01:02:36,537 --> 01:02:39,267
To the door! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

922
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:41,672
- Run!
- This way!

923
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,375
Let's party.

924
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:49,948
Bunnies!

925
01:02:50,818 --> 01:02:51,944
Flee, my love.

926
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:56,119
Run, that way. Outside!

927
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,817
Move, kids! Come on!

928
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:05,691
Buenos días, reptile.

929
01:03:10,571 --> 01:03:12,300
You've just been verminated.

930
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,501
You stink.

931
01:03:16,577 --> 01:03:20,172
That's because you let them
into my... house!

932
01:03:20,248 --> 01:03:22,648
- Those...
- Hey, Nancy, stop your honkin'.

933
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:26,084
These little guys will be
disposed of quickly and humanely.

934
01:03:26,154 --> 01:03:29,920
No! Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.

935
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:35,855
It was a pleasure
doing business with you, ma'am.

936
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:56,914
- What's he gonna do to us, Mama?
- I don't know, baby.

937
01:03:57,952 --> 01:04:00,546
I don't wanna die, Dad. Not for real.

938
01:04:00,621 --> 01:04:04,489
There, there, there, sweetheart.
We'll be OK.

939
01:04:08,329 --> 01:04:10,820
You were right about him, Verne.

940
01:04:10,898 --> 01:04:13,628
We shoulda listened. Sorry there.

941
01:04:13,701 --> 01:04:15,862
No.

942
01:04:17,238 --> 01:04:21,868
I knew we couldn't trust him,
and I got us into this.

943
01:04:21,943 --> 01:04:24,377
I should've known better.

944
01:04:31,819 --> 01:04:33,753
Wow!

945
01:04:33,821 --> 01:04:34,810
Vincent?

946
01:04:34,889 --> 01:04:37,824
So I was on my way
down here to kill you.

947
01:04:37,892 --> 01:04:41,555
But I stopped to watch the show,
and I gotta say...

948
01:04:43,164 --> 01:04:45,530
...that, right there,

949
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,227
is a thing of beauty.

950
01:04:49,771 --> 01:04:53,468
That is the most vicious, deceitful,

951
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:56,669
self-serving thing I've ever seen.

952
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:59,570
Classic RJ.

953
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:03,708
You take the food,
and they take the fall.

954
01:05:08,723 --> 01:05:12,250
You keep this up,
you're gonna end up just like me.

955
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:15,625
Having everything you ever wanted.

956
01:05:15,696 --> 01:05:18,460
But I already had that.

957
01:05:18,533 --> 01:05:22,025
What, them? Who are you kidding?

958
01:05:22,103 --> 01:05:25,834
You said it yourself,
you're a family of one.

959
01:05:25,907 --> 01:05:27,807
Always will be.

960
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:30,673
It's how guys like you and me survive.

961
01:05:30,745 --> 01:05:34,010
So a few saps got hurt in the process.

962
01:05:34,082 --> 01:05:38,746
Tough. That's life.
Trust me, you don't need them.

963
01:05:40,088 --> 01:05:43,182
Actually, I do.

964
01:05:45,259 --> 01:05:48,422
And right now, they really need me.

965
01:05:49,964 --> 01:05:51,989
So I really need this!

966
01:05:52,066 --> 01:05:53,761
RJ!

967
01:06:00,475 --> 01:06:02,272
What the...?

968
01:06:08,983 --> 01:06:11,281
- There goes my back again.
- Are you OK?

969
01:06:16,224 --> 01:06:18,920
You sorry sack of rat dung.

970
01:06:18,993 --> 01:06:21,860
Whoa, Stella, this is a rescue.
I'm rescuing you.

971
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:24,921
I'm gonna gas you so hard
your grandchildren'll stink.

972
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:26,626
- Bear!
- What's that?

973
01:06:26,701 --> 01:06:27,690
- Bear!
- Hair?

974
01:06:27,768 --> 01:06:29,099
- Bear!
- Dare?

975
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,229
- Bear!
- Oh, bear!

976
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:38,169
What?

977
01:06:41,949 --> 01:06:43,849
- We're out of control!
- We can drive.

978
01:06:43,918 --> 01:06:47,012
- It's just like Auto-Homicide 3!
- What?

979
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:54,958
Verne, let me in!
Wrong button! Wrong button!

980
01:06:56,397 --> 01:07:01,198
- Please select destination.
- Take us home! Take us to the log!

981
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:04,329
Previous destination selected.
Make a legal U-turn.

982
01:07:04,405 --> 01:07:05,565
We got it!

983
01:07:09,677 --> 01:07:12,737
- Hammy! Let me in!
- Not listening to RJ.

984
01:07:14,015 --> 01:07:15,915
Kids, lose that bear!

985
01:07:16,017 --> 01:07:17,416
What weapons do we have?

986
01:07:17,485 --> 01:07:19,976
- We've got a hammer.
- Cool.

987
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:23,112
You little...

988
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:27,389
Thank you. Yes, yes! Hey!

989
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:30,897
- Let me in, let me in!
- No! Ring-tailed charlatan!

990
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:31,954
Ozzie!

991
01:07:32,033 --> 01:07:34,024
He's trying to help us. Just let him in.

992
01:07:34,101 --> 01:07:37,628
- After what he did to us?
- But he came back.

993
01:07:37,705 --> 01:07:39,263
And he brought a bear.

994
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:46,844
- No fighting while we're driving.
- We will turn this van around, mister.

995
01:07:48,015 --> 01:07:49,448
He started it.

996
01:07:49,517 --> 01:07:51,610
I'm telling you, he's trying to help us.

997
01:07:51,686 --> 01:07:55,178
But, Verne, you're the one
who always says trust your tail.

998
01:07:55,256 --> 01:07:56,780
But it's not tingling.

999
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:00,559
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hey!

1000
01:08:02,029 --> 01:08:03,519
Thank you, thank you.

1001
01:08:05,766 --> 01:08:07,927
- You're dead, RJ!
- Duck!

1002
01:08:08,002 --> 01:08:10,562
- And your friends are next.
- Look out!

1003
01:08:12,273 --> 01:08:14,366
Make an immediate left turn.

1004
01:08:18,045 --> 01:08:19,706
Bonus points!

1005
01:08:29,056 --> 01:08:31,217
Yeah!

1006
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:36,022
RJ!

1007
01:08:36,097 --> 01:08:37,359
Yeah!

1008
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:39,729
- Look out.
- High score.

1009
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,030
No, no, no, no!

1010
01:09:01,856 --> 01:09:03,756
You have arrived.

1011
01:09:07,662 --> 01:09:09,789
Everybody all right?

1012
01:09:12,033 --> 01:09:14,399
- Come on!
- We've gotta go, we've gotta go!

1013
01:09:14,468 --> 01:09:16,959
The old jazz dance injury.

1014
01:09:17,038 --> 01:09:19,302
- Come on, come on. Quillo!
- Go, go, go.

1015
01:09:25,179 --> 01:09:26,874
- Did we make it?
- That was close!

1016
01:09:26,947 --> 01:09:28,209
- All right!
- Are we here?

1017
01:09:28,282 --> 01:09:30,773
Penny? The kids here? Hammy?

1018
01:09:30,851 --> 01:09:32,648
Scary clown.

1019
01:09:40,995 --> 01:09:42,257
Look out!

1020
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:51,132
A weed hacker, Verne. A weed hacker!

1021
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,904
- Hey!
- Up, up, go up.

1022
01:09:54,975 --> 01:09:58,411
Show your little rat faces.
Filthy creatures.

1023
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,311
Stay in the woods where you belong.

1024
01:10:01,382 --> 01:10:02,940
Watch out!

1025
01:10:08,089 --> 01:10:12,048
You guys wanna party, do ya?
All right, then, let's party.

1026
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,323
- Mom!
- Kids!

1027
01:10:16,397 --> 01:10:19,730
Penny, Lou, look out! Down!

1028
01:10:21,469 --> 01:10:25,166
That's it! Verne, get everybody
out of here. I'll distract him.

1029
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:28,402
- Are you crazy? He'll kill you.
- Well, I'm the one he wants.

1030
01:10:28,476 --> 01:10:30,171
Take care of your family, Verne.

1031
01:10:30,244 --> 01:10:32,371
I intend to. The whole family.

1032
01:10:32,446 --> 01:10:35,176
- There's got to be something we can do.
- There's no time.

1033
01:10:37,952 --> 01:10:39,510
Hammy!

1034
01:10:45,726 --> 01:10:47,853
Hey, Vincent. You were right.

1035
01:10:47,928 --> 01:10:51,455
With a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.

1036
01:10:51,532 --> 01:10:53,466
RJ!

1037
01:10:54,735 --> 01:10:57,135
Now, Hammy. Go, go, go!

1038
01:10:57,204 --> 01:10:58,865
OK...

1039
01:11:36,477 --> 01:11:38,445
I got the cookie.

1040
01:12:19,653 --> 01:12:23,589
- That's the...
- The Depelter Turbo.

1041
01:12:23,657 --> 01:12:26,421
Prepare for a lot of stinging.

1042
01:12:27,027 --> 01:12:30,155
Oh, no! No, no! No, no! No!

1043
01:12:42,843 --> 01:12:45,073
Ouch!

1044
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:48,080
That stung like I knew it would!

1045
01:12:58,759 --> 01:13:00,693
- Yeah!
- All right!

1046
01:13:02,696 --> 01:13:04,687
Good job, everybody. That's teamwork.

1047
01:13:04,765 --> 01:13:07,290
Come here, Hammy, come here.
You are a genius, my boy.

1048
01:13:07,368 --> 01:13:08,995
Oh, thank you.

1049
01:13:10,938 --> 01:13:13,964
And, Verne,
don't you ever fix this shell!

1050
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:16,407
Yeah. Glad it's working for ya.

1051
01:13:16,477 --> 01:13:18,411
Take it off, give it back.

1052
01:13:18,846 --> 01:13:22,043
Here we go, off to the
Rockies for you, Smoky.

1053
01:13:22,116 --> 01:13:24,482
Now, you do realize
that was a Depelter Turbo?

1054
01:13:24,552 --> 01:13:26,645
Officer, please. It was that Verminator.

1055
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,655
He sold it to me.
This has nothing to do with me.

1056
01:13:29,723 --> 01:13:31,190
Hey, hey, it was in your yard.

1057
01:13:31,258 --> 01:13:33,818
Your name's on the contract,
so tell it to the judge.

1058
01:13:33,894 --> 01:13:36,419
- No! It's not my fault! Let go of me!
- Ma'am...

1059
01:13:36,497 --> 01:13:40,263
I can't be arrested! I'm the president
of the homeowner's association!

1060
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:41,767
Take her down!

1061
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:44,065
She's getting away!

1062
01:13:44,138 --> 01:13:47,733
- We got a twitcher! Watch it! Ma'am!
- Get her!

1063
01:13:49,109 --> 01:13:50,940
- Stop that!
- Can I get help over here?

1064
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:52,740
Somebody get a hold of her legs!

1065
01:13:52,813 --> 01:13:54,280
- Play?
- Oh, no!

1066
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:56,680
No, no! No, no!

1067
01:13:57,785 --> 01:13:59,252
High five, Hammy!

1068
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,220
- Yes!
- It worked!

1069
01:14:01,288 --> 01:14:03,222
We did it!

1070
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:06,259
- Oh, yes!
- Stella!

1071
01:14:06,327 --> 01:14:08,056
- Stella!
- Over here, Tiger.

1072
01:14:08,128 --> 01:14:09,618
Oh, Stella.

1073
01:14:11,332 --> 01:14:16,031
So this is the outdoor woods? I like it.

1074
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:19,231
Come on, big boy.
You're coming with me.

1075
01:14:19,306 --> 01:14:22,366
You know, RJ, just for the record,

1076
01:14:22,443 --> 01:14:25,276
if you had told us that all
that food you were trying to get

1077
01:14:25,346 --> 01:14:28,907
was to pay back an angry bear,
we would've given it to you.

1078
01:14:28,983 --> 01:14:32,282
- Really?
- Yeah, that's what families do.

1079
01:14:32,353 --> 01:14:34,378
They look out for each other.

1080
01:14:34,455 --> 01:14:40,223
- I've never had anything like that.
- I know. But believe me, this...

1081
01:14:40,294 --> 01:14:43,058
This is the gateway to the good life.

1082
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:45,121
Wish you would've told me that sooner.

1083
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:48,657
Well, that's bad communication.
Also something families do.

1084
01:14:48,736 --> 01:14:51,534
So, what do you say?
You wanna be a part of it?

1085
01:14:56,910 --> 01:15:01,540
Come here, come here.
I promised I wouldn't do this. OK.

1086
01:15:02,383 --> 01:15:04,351
Welcome to the family!

1087
01:15:04,418 --> 01:15:06,079
- Hey!
- Group hug!

1088
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:07,745
OK, OK.

1089
01:15:07,821 --> 01:15:10,517
What a first week of spring.

1090
01:15:10,591 --> 01:15:14,118
Wait a minute! That means
there's only 267 days left till winter.

1091
01:15:14,194 --> 01:15:15,889
What are we gonna do for food?

1092
01:15:17,731 --> 01:15:20,063
Yes, Hammy.

1093
01:15:20,134 --> 01:15:21,931
I filled the log.

1094
01:15:22,002 --> 01:15:24,664
- Jeepers!
- What...?

1095
01:15:24,772 --> 01:15:28,572
Look, look! I found my nuts!

1096
01:17:47,179 --> 01:17:51,616
That, my friends, is the object
of all human attention and devotion.

1097
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:54,414
- And they call it a TV.
- Wicked cool!

1098
01:17:54,487 --> 01:17:57,684
Humans feel an inner need
to connect with the world around them.

1099
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:58,848
That is super-duper.

1100
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,119
They also feel a need
to sit on their fat butts.

1101
01:18:01,193 --> 01:18:03,559
Watching TV fulfills both needs
at the same time.

1102
01:18:03,629 --> 01:18:05,256
Wow. Interesting.

1103
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:09,062
Come on, kids. Family time there,
in front of the TV. Got your snack food?

1104
01:18:09,134 --> 01:18:12,729
Buy a vowel. Buy a vowel!
Buy a "Y". Please buy a "Y".

1105
01:18:12,805 --> 01:18:15,296
- I can't find the remote.
- Hey, Spikey, race ya!

1106
01:18:15,374 --> 01:18:17,899
- Has anybody seen the remote?
- Dad, chill.

1107
01:18:17,977 --> 01:18:19,467
I could do a little TV.

1108
01:18:19,545 --> 01:18:22,139
Today's the day we find out
if the baby is gifted

1109
01:18:22,214 --> 01:18:23,704
or if Saxon is really an alien.

1110
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,147
Like Khan in Star Trek II!

1111
01:18:25,217 --> 01:18:27,845
The Genesis Project
was in the hands of the Enterprise,

1112
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,047
but Khan had his plan
to steal the invention!

1113
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:33,717
- Well, that was specific.
- I saw it on TNT, a retrospective.

1114
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:36,283
- Gummi Worm, anybody?
- Let me have one.

1115
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:38,227
Bucky, pass this to Lou.

1116
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:40,458
- Taste this.
- Don't you take that.

1117
01:18:40,533 --> 01:18:42,865
- This is the perfect food.
- Fat-free cookies?

1118
01:18:42,935 --> 01:18:44,368
Might as well be eating dirt.

1119
01:18:44,436 --> 01:18:47,428
I've had dirt. I don't like dirt.
It tastes like dirt.

1120
01:18:47,506 --> 01:18:50,031
The show is starting.

1121
01:22:42,441 --> 01:22:44,375
Hang on a minute.

1122
01:22:44,443 --> 01:22:47,571
I can't wait. I can't wait.

1123
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,610
Yes! Here we go.

1124
01:22:56,855 --> 01:22:59,790
- Kind of anticlimactic.
- Shoot!
