3
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:29,725
Many years ago
I lived in Austin, Texas,

4
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:33,695
and I worked at McDonald's.

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,934
It is an honor and a privilege

6
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:43,303
to speak to you today,

7
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,409

8
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:55,680

00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:24,287
<i>I noticed that from the start</i>
<i>that Dan was different.</i>

33
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:26,522
<i>I had him on a crib</i>
<i>in our little bedroom</i>

34
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:28,924
<i>and I would go in</i>
<i>and talk to him,</i>
<i>change his diaper,</i>

35
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:33,128
<i>and I would squeal at him</i>
<i>and he would squeal back</i>
<i>at me.</i>

36
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,898
That's a small baby
communicating, I thought.

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,936
Being, uh, six years younger
than his four brothers
and sisters,

38
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:43,938
<i>he was pampered by them.</i>

39
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,007
<i>And, uh, they nursed him along.</i>

40
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,475
<i>But we didn't notice</i>
<i>at that time</i>

41
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:52,245
<i>that there was</i>
<i>any special talents</i>
<i>involved or anything.</i>

42
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:55,615
<i>Mabel:</i>
<i>When he went to school,</i>
<i>they tested the kids,</i>

43
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:59,919
<i>and Dan was put</i>
<i>in the highest group</i>
<i>of the highest class.</i>

44
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:03,489
<i>His teacher was</i>
<i>really mad at him</i>
<i>and it's understandable</i>

45
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:06,725
<i>because Dan doesn't</i>
<i>follow directions.</i>

46
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:10,462
<i>You know,</i>
<i>when he was in junior high,</i>

47
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,632
<i>he suddenly lost</i>
<i>all his wonderful confidence,</i>

48
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:19,036
<i>and I guess it was</i>
<i>the beginning of his illness.</i>

49
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:22,505
<i>Bill: He and his brother</i>
<i>decided to make</i>
<i>their own movie.</i>

50

<i>And it was a collaborative</i>
<i>effort between the two</i>
<i>brothers working together.</i>

51
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:31,779
And Dan had to change clothes
and pretend to be his mother.

52
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:36,383
Because his mother and I
weren't in the movie actually.

53
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:37,517

54

<i>Mabel: Dan is the director</i>
<i>and the actor</i>

55

<i>portraying himself in parts</i>

56
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:47,992

00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:55,297

<i>Wake up.</i>

61

<i>Dan's hard to deal</i>
<i>with sometimes.</i>

62
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:03,937
<i>He thought, "I'm artistic.</i>
<i>I shouldn't have to do</i>
<i>those things."</i>

71

<i>pictured me that way?</i>

72
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,326
<i>This is ridiculous,</i>

73
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:36,097
<i>I think it's popcorn</i>
<i>and green kool-aid.</i>

74
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:39,499
<i>He was a trial.</i>

75
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:45,938
I was sort of
the star art guy
at the high school.

<i>You know,</i>
<i>the... the new kid in town,</i>

79
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:55,279
<i>I had to find out who this was.</i>

80
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:58,315
<i>A friend of mine told me,</i>
<i>"there's this kid,</i>

<i>The guy is a natural,</i>
<i>an absolute natural.</i>

84
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,424
<i>He never even had</i>
<i>to learn to draw.</i>

85

He, for some reason,

358
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,866

<i>dancing on my walls ¶</i>

475
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:52,814
<i>¶ thoughts scatter like birds ¶</i>

476
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,550
Daniel, of course,
loves the Beatles,
worships them.

477
00:28:55,552 --> 00:29:01,022
And, uh, I can see that
<i>hi, how are you</i> could be
like <i> meet the Beatles!</i>

478
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:05,292
<i>Come grab this</i>
<i>and start the new</i>
<i>Daniel johnston mania!</i>

479
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:08,194
<i>And in his head,</i>
<i>of course, it was there.</i>

480
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:09,495
<i>He was the Beatles.</i>

481
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,831
And it was from
deep inside here.

482
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,933
Hi, how are you?
I'm Daniel johnston,

483
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:18,036
and this is what scares me
and this is what I love,

484
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:19,003
and this is what terrifies me.

485
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:24,274
<i>Ken: You just hear that</i>
<i>and, uh, your mind will</i>
<i>turn around to his.</i>

486
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:26,009
<i>You start off hearing</i>
<i>this noise,</i>

487
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:28,578
<i>then eventually</i>
<i>you hear the Beatles.</i>

488
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,545
<i>You hear the whole symphony.</i>

489
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:32,447
He actually didn't
just record a tape
and mass produce it.

490
00:29:32,449 --> 00:29:37,285
<i>He sometimes couldn't</i>
<i>duplicate, so he had</i>
<i>to sing the entire tape</i>

491
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:40,588
<i>from beginning to end</i>
<i>to hand you a copy.</i>

492
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,092
<i>Go back home. Start again.</i>
<i>Song by song.</i>
<i>Fill up the tape.</i>

493
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:46,293
<i>Hand another person a copy.</i>

494
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:49,863
<i>Fill it up. Go. And finally</i>
<i>write another album.</i>

495
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:51,030
Start the whole process
over again.

496
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:55,300
<i>Kathy: As far as I know</i>
<i>his very first, like,</i>
<i>public show that he did</i>

497
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:57,669
<i>was done opening for glass eye.</i>

498
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,704
<i>And he was so nervous.</i>

499
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:00,604
<i>He literally was vibrating.</i>

500
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:04,140
<i>And he also had</i>
<i>recently decided,</i>
<i>since coming to Austin,</i>

501
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:06,909
<i>that he wasn't gonna</i>
<i>play piano anymore,</i>
<i>something he does rather well.</i>

502
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:11,280
<i>He decided that he was</i>
<i>gonna play guitar like all</i>
<i>the Austin guitar slingers.</i>

503
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:12,614
<i>And he really couldn't play.</i>

504
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:13,581
<i>That was scary for him, too.</i>

505
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:16,684
All of a sudden
it quieted down like
it was church or something.

506
00:30:16,686 --> 00:30:18,218
Daniel comes on stage.
It was very unusual

507
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,487
<i>because anyone playing</i>
<i>their first show,</i>
<i>it's like you're lucky</i>

508
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:22,621
<i>to get anyone to pay attention.</i>

509
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:25,423
<i>But everyone was</i>
<i>absolutely silent and</i>
<i>he looked so nervous,</i>

510
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:27,992
<i>he looked like he was</i>
<i>gonna vomit the whole time.</i>

511
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,159
¶(Tears stupid tears <i> playing)</i>

512
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,193

513
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:34,430
<i>¶ and it's gone</i>
<i>and it'll never come back ¶</i>

514
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,565

515
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:40,202

<i>¶ tears, stupid tears ¶</i>

517
00:30:45,074 --> 00:30:46,206
<i>¶ bring me down ¶</i>

518
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:47,240
<i>Louis: So when you</i>
<i>saw him perform,</i>

519
00:30:47,242 --> 00:30:51,143
<i>I mean, especially</i>
<i>in the early days, when he did</i>
<i>the two or three song sets,</i>

520
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:52,711
sometimes
they were God-awful,

521
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:54,579
and sometimes they were
unbelievably brilliant.

522
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:56,213
I mean, sometimes
he just nailed it.

523
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:58,415
I mean, sometimes
it was so abstract.

524
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:00,016
<i>I mean, some of it was</i>
<i>what wasn't there.</i>

525
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:02,485
<i>Sometimes there was</i>
<i>too much not there.</i>

526
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:05,020
<i>¶ Tie my brain ¶</i>

527
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:08,089
<i>¶ into a knot ¶</i>

528
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:13,760
<i>¶ those tears, stupid tears ¶</i>

529
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:17,296
<i>¶ bring me down ¶</i>

530
00:31:17,298 --> 00:31:18,664
people in the audience
tended to be like,

531
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:22,234
"what? Is this is a joke?
Is this guy
supposed to be cool?"

532
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:25,770
And they would be looking
around at each other like,
"how am I supposed to react?"

533
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:31,575
Because he was so raw
and so real in a lot of ways,
that people couldn't take it.

534
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:38,547
(Interviewer speaking)

535
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,590
<i>Louis: He's got</i>
<i>a full shift</i>
<i>at McDonald's.</i>

536
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:52,359
<i>And as close as I can tell,</i>
<i>he can't do anything.</i>

537
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:55,762
He can't cook.
He doesn't clean very well.

538
00:31:55,764 --> 00:31:59,098
<i>Dick: As in a lot of places,</i>
<i>you know,</i>
<i>they'll give him work,</i>

539
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,668
<i>but then he migrates to</i>
<i>the job with the least skill,</i>

540
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,069
<i>which was cleaning tables.</i>

541
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:05,670
<i>Ken: It was amazing that</i>
<i>he could keep his job</i>

542
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:08,706
<i>because everybody was always</i>
<i>coming in there wanting to,</i>

543
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:09,440
<i>"hey, Daniel. Hi, Daniel!"</i>

544
00:32:09,442 --> 00:32:13,544
<i>And, well, they don't</i>
<i>take well to that at,</i>
<i>you know, fast food joints.</i>

545
00:32:13,546 --> 00:32:16,246
<i>But he was employed there</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

546
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:17,614
<i>And you knew you could</i>
<i>find him there,</i>

547
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:22,085
<i>just in his little hat</i>
<i>and his little shirt there,</i>

548
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:23,052
cleanin' up,

549
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:25,788
cleanin' up other people's
spills and stuff.

550
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,656
<i>Dick: When I went to</i>
<i>visit him at McDonald's,</i>

551
00:32:27,658 --> 00:32:31,526
<i>I think it was probably</i>
<i>the first time I</i>
<i>recognized that</i>

552
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:32,960
<i>he was spacing out, you know.</i>

553
00:32:32,962 --> 00:32:37,931
<i>That there was</i>
<i>a disconnection from reality</i>
<i>or something going on.</i>

554
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:40,566
(Daniel speaking)

555
00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:44,336
<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>

556
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:59,009
1985 was just an enormous year
for Austin music.

557
00:33:59,011 --> 00:34:01,077
It was like everything
was about to break,

558
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,245
and... and again,
Daniel just came in
right at that time.

559
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:07,716
<i>Mtv started sniffing around.</i>
<i>And they brought in</i>
<i>Peter zaremba</i>

560
00:34:07,718 --> 00:34:10,618
<i>and the show they had,</i>
the cutting edge.

561
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,886
<i>They lined up all these bands</i>

562
00:34:12,888 --> 00:34:14,120
<i>and they had a big old barbeque</i>

563
00:34:14,122 --> 00:34:15,454
<i>and Daniel showed up</i>
<i>there with his tapes.</i>

564
00:34:15,456 --> 00:34:19,024
This is Daniel johnston.
Local man about town.
Musician.

565
00:34:19,026 --> 00:34:21,860
Everyone knows who he is
but... say hi to everyone.

566
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:22,627
My name is Daniel johnston

567
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:25,062
and this is the name
of my tape and it's,
<i>hi, how are you.</i>

568
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:28,098
And I, I was having
a nervous breakdown
when I recorded it.

569
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,766
He wasn't scheduled
to be on the show.

570
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:30,800
They had already
listened to tapes

571
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,968
and talked to people
at the <i> chronicle</i>
and the music critics

572
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,171
and they decided who was
gonna be on this special
and everything.

573
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:38,907
<i>But Daniel was unstoppable</i>
<i>at that point.</i>

574
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,708
<i>He was so full of confidence.</i>

575
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,342
<i>He always</i>
<i>presented himself like,</i>

576
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:44,410
<i>"I am a very incredible,</i>
<i>extraordinary human being</i>

577
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:46,912
<i>"and you're gonna be</i>
<i>really happy</i>
<i>you listened to this."</i>

578
00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:52,350
<i>How you doing? We are having</i>
<i>a casual conversation</i>
<i>on national TV.</i>

579
00:34:52,352 --> 00:34:54,618
Daniel is on mtv.

580
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,021
You know, out of nowhere,
from my point of view.

581
00:34:58,023 --> 00:35:02,291
And, uh, he's... he's on mtv
and I actually do
get to see it.

582
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:04,893
And, uh, he says to me...

583
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,795
<i>This is to David thornberry</i>
<i>from Daniel johnston.</i>

584
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:12,466
<i>And, Dave, here I am on mtv,</i>
<i>holding up my tape,</i>
hi, how are you.

00:35:12,468 --> 00:35:15,001
<i>And they're recording me</i>
<i>tonight. I'm on mtv.</i>

<i>Remember when we used to</i>
<i>watch mtv back home?</i>

<i>Look, I'm on mtv, David.</i>

588
00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:22,607
And that was his dream.
I mean, literally, that's
what he wanted to do,

589
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:23,708
is be on mtv.

were really kind of
entertained by this.

632
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:09,616
But after a while, when you'd
call to talk to Daniel,
they were not happy.

633
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:10,550
They had hamburgers to make.

634
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:14,320
<i>And then in 1986,</i>
<i>he wins a bunch of awards</i>
<i>in the Austin music awards.</i>

635
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:17,790
<i>He wins songwriter</i>
<i>of the year and best folk act,</i>
<i>which is very controversial</i>

636
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:20,192
<i>and, of course,</i>
<i>it goes to Daniel's head</i>
<i>in new and different ways.</i>

637
00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:24,829
In a town with a lot
of singer/songwriters
and a lot of folkies,

638
00:38:24,831 --> 00:38:26,063
who can play guitar,

639
00:38:26,065 --> 00:38:28,665
that might've not gone
over too well with
some people.

640
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,199
¶(Casper the friendly ghost

641
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:33,101
¶ He was smiling through
his own personal hell ¶

642
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,703
¶ dropped his last dime
in a wishing well ¶

643
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:39,740
¶ but he was hoping to close
and then he fell ¶

644
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:44,344
¶ now he's Casper
the friendly ghost ¶

645
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:48,314
in the spring of 1986, um,
I started helping Daniel.

646
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:51,083
The first thing I did was
set up his publishing company
with bug music.

647
00:38:51,085 --> 00:38:55,187
<i>I knew his music was great,</i>
<i>but I felt like for him to</i>
<i>actually make a living,</i>

648
00:38:55,189 --> 00:38:58,056
<i>he would be better off</i>
<i>if other,</i>
<i>more well-known artists</i>

649
00:38:58,058 --> 00:38:59,090
<i>were to cover his material.</i>

650
00:38:59,092 --> 00:39:03,260
¶ He was always polite
to the people who'd tell him ¶

651
00:39:03,262 --> 00:39:06,396
¶ that he was nothing
but a lazy bum ¶

652
00:39:06,398 --> 00:39:10,233
¶ but goodbye to them
he had to go ¶

653
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:13,536
¶ now he's Casper ¶

654
00:39:13,538 --> 00:39:16,672
¶ the friendly ghost ¶

655
00:39:16,874 --> 00:39:19,875
I thought that he was
almost angelic.

656
00:39:19,877 --> 00:39:22,277
And then I got to
know him better.

657
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,145
And we started being
really close friends.

658
00:39:24,147 --> 00:39:26,847
And for a little while
I was his "girlfriend."

659
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:29,516
<i>And because he was</i>
<i>very religious,</i>

660
00:39:29,518 --> 00:39:31,784
<i>this was a very chaste</i>
<i>relationship.</i>

661
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,320
<i>But even within</i>
<i>the context of that,</i>

662
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:38,690
<i>it was undeniable</i>
<i>after maybe one or two weeks</i>

663
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:42,860
<i>that something was</i>
<i>dreadfully wrong with him.</i>

664
00:39:42,862 --> 00:39:46,730
<i>Something that wasn't angelic</i>
<i>and pure and naive</i>

665
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:47,764
<i>and innocent and beautiful.</i>

666
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:52,635
<i>So I realized I can't let him</i>
<i>keep on thinking that</i>
<i>I'm his girlfriend</i>

667
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:54,603
<i>because his parents came</i>
<i>to visit him</i>

668
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:57,439
<i>and he introduced me</i>
<i>as his fiancee.</i>

669
00:39:57,441 --> 00:40:00,008
I realized that I was
going to have to say,

670
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:04,545
"Daniel, we're not
going out anymore, you know.

671
00:40:04,547 --> 00:40:05,279
"We're just friends."

672
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:11,551
<i>And I essentially spent,</i>
<i>oh, the entire summer</i>
<i>reminding him.</i>

673
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,853
<i>We broke up.</i>

674
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:16,521
<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>

675
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,571
Daniel: Now you're filming?
Randy: Dan, this is so wild.

676
00:40:33,573 --> 00:40:37,107
<i>Jeff: Daniel began</i>
<i>hanging out with his manager,</i>
<i>Randy kemper.</i>

677
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:39,309
<i>And was smoking</i>
<i>a lot of marijuana.</i>

678
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,376
<i>And he would not perform live.</i>

679
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:43,879
<i>Everybody was bugging him</i>
<i>to play live, but he just</i>
<i>didn't want to.</i>

680
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:45,247
<i>There were some changes</i>
<i>in his behavior</i>

681
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:47,182
<i>and we didn't really</i>
<i>quite know what was</i>
<i>going on with him.</i>

682
00:40:47,184 --> 00:40:50,952
<i>Randy: You know, when you do</i>
<i>stuff like that,</i>
<i>you throw me off, Daniel.</i>

683
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:54,956
<i>Kathy: I always kind of</i>
<i>imagined Daniel performing</i>
<i>like Elton John</i>

684
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,457
with costume changes
and rockettes

685
00:40:56,459 --> 00:41:00,427
and a big grand piano.
Just the kind of show
that's just ridiculous.

686
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:03,129
Almost like Andy Kaufman-esque
kind of thing.

687
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:06,031
But unfortunately,
he had his mental breakdown.

688
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:08,833
¶(Sweet loaf <i> playing)</i>

689
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:16,773
<i>Louis: So he goes to</i>
<i>a butthole surfers show</i>

690
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,741
<i>and somebody there</i>
<i>gives him a hit of acid.</i>

691
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,843
<i>And the trip really begins</i>
<i>to change everything.</i>

692
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:24,112
Again, one of the classic
scenarios of Daniel's life

693
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,448
is whenever anything
starts getting really good,

694
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,551
you know something
really ugly is gonna happen.

695
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,486
(Mechanical whirring)

696
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,054
(Groans)

697
00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:39,426
Gibby: The night in question
is September 11, 1986

698
00:41:39,428 --> 00:41:41,961
on which Daniel

699
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,897
had a bad experience, uh,

700
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:49,133
and I guess, uh, he was
under the influence

701
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:52,803
of some sort of
psychoactive substance.

702
00:41:59,545 --> 00:42:01,278
(Whirring)

703
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,848
<i>You know, I remember</i>
<i>a little bit about seeing</i>
<i>Daniel that night.</i>

704
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,252
I remember him being
sort of difficult
to deal with.

705
00:42:09,254 --> 00:42:15,091
And then we had
our thing going on and

706
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:18,927
<i>everybody started saying,</i>
<i>"Daniel's freaked out.</i>

707
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:21,262
<i>"Daniel's freaked out.</i>
<i>Daniel's freaked out."</i>

708
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:24,031
I'm coming back
to tell you, man.

709
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:27,167
I'm serious like Billy Graham.
Nothing like Billy Graham.

710
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,570
Or nothing like that.
Or nothing like nobody you
ever heard tell about nothing.

711
00:42:30,572 --> 00:42:35,174
But I'm coming back
and I'm telling you
there's a supernatural world.

712
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:37,910
There's a supernatural world

713
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:41,413
and gibby,
gibby knows about it.

714
00:42:41,415 --> 00:42:42,914
(Feuerzeig speaking)

715
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:46,217
(Chuckling)
No. I didn't give
him any LSD.

716
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:50,221
<i>I think at that point it was</i>
<i>pretty much known that, uh,</i>
<i>he was not necessarily</i>

717
00:42:50,223 --> 00:42:55,092
<i>"an" unstable character,</i>
<i>but slightly unstable</i>
<i>"of" character.</i>

718
00:42:55,094 --> 00:43:01,665
So that's the kind of person
you really wouldn't want to
engage in the, uh...

719
00:43:02,134 --> 00:43:04,434
In the LSD experience.

720
00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:10,673
Randy: Are you
Daniel johnston?

721
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:13,642
I used to be Daniel johnston.

722
00:43:15,145 --> 00:43:17,211
And who are you now?

723
00:43:18,647 --> 00:43:22,315
You know, I don't know.
I don't know.

724
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:24,450
<i>Jeff: In December of 1986,</i>

725
00:43:24,452 --> 00:43:29,788
<i>Daniel was taking</i>
<i>a lot of acid and was</i>
<i>just not himself.</i>

726
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:30,555
<i>Was very, very delusional.</i>

727
00:43:30,557 --> 00:43:35,893
<i>And there was one violent</i>
<i>incident with his manager</i>
<i>in which he attacked him</i>

728
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:39,396
<i>and, uh, put him</i>
<i>in the hospital</i>
<i>with a concussion.</i>

729
00:43:39,398 --> 00:43:40,997
(Police siren blaring)

730
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:43,766
<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>

731
00:43:47,371 --> 00:43:50,605
Dan was imagining
all kinds of things

732
00:43:50,607 --> 00:43:52,640
and he thought of himself
as God's man

733
00:43:52,642 --> 00:43:57,077
<i>to straighten things up</i>
<i>and so caused</i>
<i>a lot of trouble.</i>

734
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:58,611
All the family met
together for Christmas.

735
00:43:58,613 --> 00:44:01,814
Mom and dad couldn't
come that year
and so we had decided

736
00:44:01,816 --> 00:44:04,416
<i>since all of the siblings</i>
<i>were in Texas, that we would</i>

737
00:44:04,418 --> 00:44:05,550
<i>get together</i>
<i>and have Christmas.</i>

738
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:09,520
So we're all making these
Christmas ornaments and
his Christmas ornament

739
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,387
is this black number nine.

740
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:13,356
<i>We asked and said,</i>
<i>"Dan, that's not an</i>
<i>appropriate Christmas symbol.</i>

741
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:15,825
<i>"What does that mean?</i>
<i>And why are you doing black?</i>

742
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:17,560
<i>"That's not gonna look good</i>
<i>hanging on the tree."</i>

743
00:44:17,562 --> 00:44:20,896
<i>Dick: I remember staring</i>
<i>at him while we were</i>
<i>talking and saying,</i>

744
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:23,498
<i>"that doesn't even</i>
<i>look like Dan."</i>

745
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,300
<i>His face doesn't</i>
<i>look like Dan to me.</i>

746
00:44:26,302 --> 00:44:28,902
<i>He was in some kind</i>
<i>of manic state.</i>

747
00:44:28,904 --> 00:44:30,036
<i>We get up for a family portrait</i>

748
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:32,805
<i>and he would hang</i>
<i>a Beatles album on</i>
<i>a Christmas tree.</i>

749
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:36,775
<i>Well, I went to take it down</i>
<i>off the tree</i>
<i>and he came for me.</i>

750
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:37,909
<i>And he had super strength.</i>

751
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:42,179
And in just
a very brief struggle,
he broke my rib.

752
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:45,148
So they were
rolling around
on the floor

753
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:45,915
and it was just

754
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:49,118
not the way
our Christmas gatherings
usually are.

755
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,086
<i>He was talking</i>
<i>in different voices</i>

756
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:55,557
<i>and was accusing us</i>
<i>of teaching the children</i>
<i>satanist practice.</i>

757
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,992
<i>And that whole night we</i>
<i>didn't wanna go to sleep</i>

758
00:44:57,994 --> 00:44:59,460
<i>because if he believed</i>
<i>we were satanists,</i>

759
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:01,562
<i>he might try to do</i>
<i>something to harm us</i>

760
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:04,298
if he's the "hero of good"
or something.

761
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,399
<i>Dick: He decided</i>
<i>to make a dash</i>

762
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:08,034
<i>to go up to the attic space</i>
<i>where the kids were playing.</i>

763
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:11,270
<i>And at that point,</i>
<i>Sally went to the phone</i>
<i>and called the police.</i>

764
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:15,207
<i>Sally: We had to call</i>
<i>for some assistance and</i>

765
00:45:15,209 --> 00:45:18,443
<i>remove him from the house.</i>
<i>And my husband took him</i>
<i>to the bus station</i>

766
00:45:18,445 --> 00:45:21,245
<i>and then stayed and watched</i>
<i>to make sure he got on it,</i>

767
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:22,713
<i>so that we would all feel safe.</i>

768
00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:26,116
<i>Dick: I remember</i>
<i>going upstairs with Margie</i>

769
00:45:26,118 --> 00:45:29,452
and laying down on the bed
and we just both wept

770
00:45:29,454 --> 00:45:32,988
like he was dead, you know.
Because we didn't know
who he was.

771
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:36,891
<i>Daniel:</i>
<i>¶ Rudolph the red nosed</i>
<i>reindeer ¶</i>

772
00:45:36,893 --> 00:45:41,095
<i>¶ you'll go down in history ¶</i>

773
00:45:41,097 --> 00:45:43,130
<i>¶ yeah! ¶</i>

774
00:45:43,432 --> 00:45:47,333
<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>

775
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:03,415
I'm lying in bed.
I have pneumonia.

776
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:07,118
And the phone rings and I
have like a 103 temperature
and the phone rings

777
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,855
and somebody says, uh,
"do you know
a Daniel johnston?"

778
00:46:10,857 --> 00:46:12,022
I go, "yeah, Daniel
and I are friends."

779
00:46:12,024 --> 00:46:13,590
He goes,
"well, I think maybe
you should come here."

780
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:16,259
I go, "well,
I really don't think
I should. I'm sick."

781
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:19,161
"No. I really, really think
you should come here."

782
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:22,163
I get to campus. I have
a 103 degrees temperature.

783
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:25,332
It's 1986 and it's Christmas,
so there's nothing there.

784
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:27,133
There's no cars.
There's no people.

785
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:29,034
This campus is
completely empty.

786
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,001
It's weird.
It's eerie. It's quiet.

787
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:34,939
These people I don't know
are leading me down
and we start walking down

788
00:46:34,941 --> 00:46:35,806
to go towards the river.

789
00:46:35,808 --> 00:46:37,474
And we look over
and there's the water.

790
00:46:37,476 --> 00:46:39,409
And there standing
in the middle of the water
is Daniel.

791
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:41,110
And he's standing
in the water,
he's about knee-deep,

792
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:45,280
splashing the water,
and he's looking at us,
his eyes are like white.

793
00:46:45,282 --> 00:46:47,115
At one point he looks up
and starts singing,

794
00:46:47,117 --> 00:46:48,916
¶ running water,
running water ¶

795
00:46:48,918 --> 00:46:51,919
and then he's preaching.
And he's talking about
baptism.

796
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:54,688
And he's talking about evil.
He's really whacked.

797
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,923
We're tryin' to talk him
into coming onto the shore.

798
00:46:56,925 --> 00:47:00,126
It's going on and on and on
and it's getting real weird.

799
00:47:00,128 --> 00:47:01,894
All of a sudden,
we look over there.

800
00:47:01,896 --> 00:47:03,195
A couple of police cars
have pulled up.

801
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:04,930
<i>They forced me out,</i>
<i>they came...</i>

802
00:47:04,932 --> 00:47:07,065
<i>People were...</i>
<i>People were afraid.</i>

803
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:08,733
<i>They were afraid</i>
<i>to come up to me.</i>

804
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:11,235
<i>They didn't want me</i>
<i>to splash them with water.</i>

805
00:47:11,237 --> 00:47:14,671
<i>What was I doing down there?</i>
<i>What was going on?</i>

806
00:47:14,673 --> 00:47:16,305
<i>I knew exactly</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

807
00:47:16,307 --> 00:47:18,974
<i>I wanted to take my life</i>
<i>only a few nights before.</i>

808
00:47:18,976 --> 00:47:22,777
<i>I hit my best friend</i>
<i>over the head with</i>
<i>a lead pipe.</i>

809
00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:24,211
<i>I thought there was</i>
<i>nowhere to go.</i>

810
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:28,381
<i>I thought the military</i>
<i>takeover was going to happen</i>
<i>over Christmas time.</i>

811
00:47:28,383 --> 00:47:31,617
<i>But it didn't.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

812
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,486
<i>I thought, I knew, I saw.</i>
<i>I knew, I saw.</i>

813
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:36,988
<i>I went inside</i>
<i>the building of u.T.</i>

814
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,457
<i>I saw... I saw the things,</i>
<i>the programming,</i>

815
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:43,727
<i>the confusion,</i>
<i>the coke, Coca-Cola,</i>

816
00:47:43,729 --> 00:47:46,029
<i>the snickers, all the candy,</i>

817
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:51,034
<i>and everything being used</i>
<i>as a drug, the confusion,</i>
<i>the mind control,</i>

818
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:54,337
<i>spiritualism,</i>
<i>the cultural upheaval, flip.</i>

819
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:57,206
<i>Man, yes, it's really</i>
<i>happening. They were</i>
<i>really doing it, man.</i>

820
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:01,810
<i>I'm talking, if you don't</i>
<i>know about it. I'm talking</i>
<i>like Nazi Germany.</i>

821
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:02,744
All great artists are crazy,

822
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:05,847
but there's a difference
between the abstract
great artist being crazy

823
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:09,150
and this person doing
damage to you or to himself,

824
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,018
and how involved
do you wanna be?

825
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,820
<i>We'd spent our whole lives,</i>
<i>we're those kind of people</i>

826
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:15,521
<i>who love the notion</i>
<i>of the crazy artist.</i>

827
00:48:15,523 --> 00:48:16,889
<i>You know, van gogh</i>
<i>cutting off his ear.</i>

828
00:48:16,891 --> 00:48:19,091
<i>And we've read those books</i>
<i>and we've, you know,</i>
<i>collected the art</i>

829
00:48:19,093 --> 00:48:22,127
<i>and we've seen the movies</i>
<i>and we really loved</i>
<i>the crazy people</i>

830
00:48:22,129 --> 00:48:23,328
<i>because they were</i>
<i>the pure people.</i>

831
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,430
<i>You know, they didn't have</i>
<i>any commercial sense.</i>

832
00:48:25,432 --> 00:48:27,365
<i>And yet, he was</i>
<i>a real sick person.</i>

833
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:30,234
<i>And it was really,</i>
<i>"what are we gonna do?"</i>

834
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:33,770
And so, I mean, we do
the most pedestrian thing
possible.

835
00:48:33,772 --> 00:48:34,337
We commit him.

836
00:48:34,339 --> 00:48:36,806
And you actually felt, I mean,
a certain amount of guilt.

837
00:48:36,808 --> 00:48:39,141
I mean, it was like,
if I was around van gogh...

838
00:48:39,143 --> 00:48:41,676
You know, I've always had
contempt for those people

839
00:48:41,678 --> 00:48:42,777
who didn't understand genius,

840
00:48:42,779 --> 00:48:44,211
and here I am given my shot
and what I'm saying is,

841
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:48,348
please put him in the hospital
'cause we don't wanna
have to deal with him.

842
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,182
We don't know what to do.

843
00:48:49,184 --> 00:48:51,317
When I went to see him
in the hospital,
they wanted to know

844
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:52,751
what my relationship
with Daniel was.

845
00:48:52,753 --> 00:48:54,519
And I had been working
informally as his publicist.

846
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:58,789
But, um, I needed
to tell them something
a little better than that.

847
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:00,056
And I assumed
that Randy kemper,

848
00:49:00,058 --> 00:49:03,492
after having been
beat over the head
with a lead pipe

849
00:49:03,494 --> 00:49:05,861
did not wanna continue
managing Daniel.

850
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:08,063
So I said I was his manager.

851
00:49:08,065 --> 00:49:09,697
<i>Jeff: I helped get Daniel</i>
<i>out of the hospital</i>

852
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:13,067
<i>because I didn't</i>
<i>fully understand</i>
<i>why he was there.</i>

853
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:14,268
<i>All I knew was he needed</i>
<i>to get out of there.</i>

854
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:18,972
<i>And as soon as I did get him</i>
<i>out, I began hearing from</i>
<i>other people asking me,</i>

855
00:49:18,974 --> 00:49:19,973
<i>why did I do that.</i>

856
00:49:19,975 --> 00:49:22,875
<i>But it seemed like he was</i>
<i>doing well enough.</i>

857
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:23,575
<i>He was back in his home.</i>

858
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:27,845
<i>And it seemed like</i>
<i>everything was okay, although</i>
<i>it was very borderline.</i>

859
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:30,781
It's like true
in science fiction

860
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:33,550
and it's the new
supernatural age,

861
00:49:33,552 --> 00:49:35,051
you know, they spoke
of in <i> revelations.</i>

862
00:49:35,053 --> 00:49:37,987
And <i> number nine, number nine,</i>
the Beatles' song,
<i>number nine.</i>

863
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:41,523
<i>Jeff: He was obsessed</i>
<i>with the devil and Satan.</i>

864
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:44,158
Daniel: Do not
get that number, 6-6-6.

865
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,461
Do not get 6-6-6
imprinted on your hand.

866
00:49:47,463 --> 00:49:49,429
<i>Jeff: I had never really</i>
<i>heard him talk about</i>
<i>the devil before,</i>

867
00:49:49,431 --> 00:49:52,899
<i>and he became so obsessed</i>
<i>that it was all he could</i>
<i>talk about.</i>

868
00:49:52,901 --> 00:49:57,270
You must not give in
to the devil,
ladies and gentlemen.

869
00:49:57,272 --> 00:50:00,806
The world in confusion,
ladies and gentlemen.

870
00:50:00,808 --> 00:50:03,008
Somebody is
manufacturing these.

871
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,476
They're spreading those around.

872
00:50:04,478 --> 00:50:06,744
They might be
mounting them up around.

873
00:50:06,746 --> 00:50:09,947
Evil, ladies and gentlemen,
evil.

874
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:10,814
<i>Jeff: Over the next few days,</i>

875
00:50:10,816 --> 00:50:13,750
<i>he began to throw literally</i>
<i>everything he owned away.</i>

876
00:50:13,752 --> 00:50:15,952
<i>He threw all his drawings away.</i>

877
00:50:15,954 --> 00:50:16,852
<i>He threw master tapes away.</i>

878
00:50:16,854 --> 00:50:19,521
<i>And he was down to just</i>
<i>three of four possessions</i>

879
00:50:19,523 --> 00:50:21,589
<i>the last time I went</i>
<i>to his apartment.</i>

880
00:50:21,591 --> 00:50:22,823
<i>He still had his tape deck.</i>

881
00:50:22,825 --> 00:50:26,526
<i>He still had his guitar</i>
<i>and maybe one or two</i>
<i>other things.</i>

882
00:50:26,528 --> 00:50:27,660
<i>And as soon as I saw this,</i>

883
00:50:27,662 --> 00:50:31,196
<i>my immediate fear was that</i>
<i>he's gonna kill himself.</i>

884
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:34,098
It's better to die,
ladies and gentlemen.

885
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,366
And live forever.

886
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:38,734
And that is
what I intend to do.

887
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,937
<i>Jeff: I went home that night,</i>
<i>not knowing what to do.</i>

888
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:44,439
Daniel: The world is
turning to hell.

889
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:47,909
<i>I did not know very much</i>
<i>about his relationship</i>
<i>with his family,</i>

890
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,710
<i>but I figured</i>
<i>they need to know this.</i>

891
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:51,546
<i>And I called his father</i>
<i>that night</i>

892
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:55,950
<i>and he was in Austin</i>
<i>within 24 hours.</i>

893
00:50:56,152 --> 00:50:59,486
He was thin as a rail
and losing weight

894
00:50:59,488 --> 00:51:01,688
and, uh, all kinds of things.

895
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,657
His depression finally
caught up with him.

896
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:06,558
Evil!

897
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:11,028
<i>Bill: Because he,</i>
<i>he was losing it.</i>

00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:15,165
<i>Jeff: When Daniel's father</i>
<i>took him back</i>
<i>to West Virginia,</i>

900

<i>Daniel announced</i>
<i>his retirement.</i>

901
00:51:16,168 --> 00:51:19,469
<i>And instantly became</i>

<i>to the psychiatrist</i>

907

<i>and she said she would have</i>

908
00:51:47,862 --> 00:51:49,294
<i>a psychiatrist examine him.</i>

909
00:51:49,296 --> 00:51:53,197
<i>Bill: They wire your brain up</i>
<i>and make sure you got</i>
<i>what your brain activity is,</i>

910
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:55,966
<i>and check if there is</i>
<i>any brain damage or anything.</i>

911
00:51:55,968 --> 00:51:56,733

Um...

917

925
00:52:48,311 --> 00:52:52,446
During this period,

<i>with bands like sonic youth</i>

00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:53,263
If I can make it here,
I can make it anywhere, right?

945
00:53:53,265 --> 00:53:53,963
That's what they say.

946
00:53:53,965 --> 00:53:56,265
<i>Jeff: There were two</i>
<i>primary goals of this trip.</i>

947
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:57,232
<i>One was to, uh, meet Kramer</i>

948
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,134
<i>and check out</i>
<i>the noise New York</i>
<i>recording studio,</i>

949
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,436
<i>with the possibility of</i>
<i>recording for shimmy disc.</i>

950
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:05,572
<i>And the other was</i>
<i>to do some recording</i>
<i>with moe Tucker,</i>

951
00:54:05,574 --> 00:54:06,973
<i>the drummer for</i>
<i>the velvet underground.</i>

952
00:54:06,975 --> 00:54:09,375
<i>This session was</i>
<i>put together by Jad fair.</i>

953
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:13,679
<i>And this would allow</i>
<i>Daniel to meet Jad</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

954
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:16,114
<i>¶(Music playing)</i>

955
00:54:24,023 --> 00:54:28,392
As Daniel's manager, I'm
in touch with Steve shelley
on a nightly basis.

956
00:54:28,394 --> 00:54:30,293
And all of a sudden,
one night I get a call

957
00:54:30,295 --> 00:54:31,527
that Daniel has been
arrested that day.

958
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:35,430
<i>It seems that they decided</i>
<i>to take him to</i>
<i>the statue of liberty.</i>

959
00:54:35,432 --> 00:54:38,366
<i>And while Daniel was touring</i>
<i>the statue of liberty,</i>

960
00:54:38,368 --> 00:54:39,500
<i>like any tourist would want to,</i>

961
00:54:39,502 --> 00:54:42,903
<i>he apparently was</i>
<i>drawing graffiti</i>
<i>inside the stairwell.</i>

962
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:46,306
<i>Christian fish.</i>
<i>Hundreds of them,</i>
<i>from what I understand.</i>

963
00:54:46,308 --> 00:54:50,343
I guess it's
the anti-Satan symbol. Um...

964
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:52,912
<i>(Police officer speaking)</i>

965

<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>

966
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:11,863
<i>Jeff: A couple days after</i>
<i>that, there's a bizarre gig</i>
<i>at pier platters.</i>

967
00:55:11,865 --> 00:55:14,298
<i>I say bizarre because he's</i>
<i>proselytizing the audience.</i>

968
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,235
<i>Trying to force</i>
<i>his religious beliefs</i>
<i>on the audience, basically.</i>

969
00:55:18,237 --> 00:55:20,870
Jesus Christ is number seven.

970
00:55:20,872 --> 00:55:23,138
Satan is number six.

971
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,106
Number eight is eternal death.

972
00:55:25,108 --> 00:55:29,376
And number nine, number nine,
number nine,

973
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:31,644
is the human number.

974
00:55:31,646 --> 00:55:36,215
Remember these things
and don't listen to the lies
that people will tell you.

975
00:55:36,217 --> 00:55:37,649
Number seven is Jesus Christ.

976
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:39,150
<i>Jeff: When Daniel performed</i>
<i>at pier platters,</i>

977
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:43,154
<i>it was like the cream</i>

<i>(Steve speaking)</i>

He told Kramer that if he
can't get anywhere, he was
gonna sleep in my hallway.

1015
00:58:04,176 --> 00:58:05,842
Lee: Yeah, but that's
just an idle threat.

1016
00:58:05,844 --> 00:58:06,909
Thurston: When's
the next train to...

1017
00:58:06,911 --> 00:58:08,911
I mean, I can't
imagine him staying
in the bus station,

1018
00:58:08,913 --> 00:58:11,813
and actually getting
on the bus all by himself.

1019
00:58:11,815 --> 00:58:15,750
<i>Jeff: I know the members</i>
<i>of sonic youth were</i>
<i>looking all over for Daniel.</i>

1020

<i>He had been spotted</i>
<i>in various places,</i>

1021
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,522

1022

Lee: Keep an eye peeled
for Daniel.
He might just be a...

1023
00:58:24,894 --> 00:58:26,760
If you see a wandering guy
in white.

1024

Lee: Really?

1028
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:40,471
Yeah. He's walking over here.

1029
00:58:40,473 --> 00:58:41,171
Let's go get him.

1030
00:58:41,173 --> 00:58:44,774
Steve is totally,
totally pissed off.
Daniel: He's freaked out.

1031
00:58:44,776 --> 00:58:45,975
Yeah, he's freaked out
and he's not gonna...

1032
00:58:45,977 --> 00:58:49,078
He was gonna call my parents
and my parents will put me
in a mental home.

1033
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,681
Lee: The best thing to do
at this point,
you have a bus ticket,

1034
00:58:52,683 --> 00:58:53,848
I think you should
use it.
I'm not going home.

1035
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:57,284
I'm on a mission from God
and I have two more weeks
to spend in this town.

1036
00:58:57,286 --> 00:59:02,122
The situation here
for you now is not
the best that it could be.

1037
00:59:02,124 --> 00:59:03,790
And we really don't know
what to do,

1038
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:06,492
I mean, you're
a long way from home,

1039
00:59:06,494 --> 00:59:07,025
and we don't...

1040
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:08,259
Listen, I called my manager

1041
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:10,361
and I started to
talk to him about it
and was I going to...

1042
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:12,129
Jeff?
Yeah, I was
going to warn him

1043
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,163
not to say anything
to my parents.

1044
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:16,633
I was going to say,
"if you say anything
to my parents,

1045
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:17,400
"I'm gonna fire you."

1046
00:59:17,402 --> 00:59:19,702
And I was saying,
"this is a warning
and this is a threat."

1047
00:59:19,704 --> 00:59:22,204
And he says,
"I don't wanna hear
any of your damn threats."

1048
00:59:22,206 --> 00:59:23,371
And he hung up on me.
My manager.

1049
00:59:23,373 --> 00:59:26,507
Now, don't you see the devil?
The devil Satan

1050
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:29,443
is trying to stop me
from staying in this town?

1051
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:31,445
Don't you see
how clear that is?

1052
00:59:31,447 --> 00:59:33,113
<i>Jeff: He just would</i>
<i>not go home</i>

1053
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:35,715
<i>and was determined</i>
<i>to stay in New York.</i>

1054
00:59:35,717 --> 00:59:38,284
<i>He ended up on the bowery,</i>
<i>in a men's shelter,</i>

1055
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:42,521
<i>where he was assaulted</i>
<i>once or twice,</i>

<i>while everybody else</i>

<i>His parents, myself, his hosts.</i>

1060
00:59:52,898 --> 00:59:56,966

<i>whereas Daniel doesn't even</i>
<i>realize there's a problem.</i>

1061
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:01,170
<i>Finally, a couple of friends</i>
<i>made arrangements to take him</i>
<i>to the bus station,</i>

my dinner with Daniel,

1099
01:02:39,975 --> 01:02:40,606

1100
01:02:40,608 --> 01:02:42,874
<i>And we'll just be</i>
<i>talking during dinnertime.</i>

1101
01:02:42,876 --> 01:02:47,745
Daniel: So I went to college
right across the river from
where the funeral home is.

1102
01:02:47,747 --> 01:02:53,150
There was this girl there,
and as soon as I saw her,
you know,

1103
01:02:53,152 --> 01:02:56,286
I swear to God, it looked like
she was glowing, you know.

1104

<i>Jad: Daniel wanted to,</i>
<i>uh, direct.</i>

1105
01:02:57,956 --> 01:03:01,724
Stand right there,

and you sit in the chair.

1106
01:03:01,726 --> 01:03:05,360

<i>specific ideas</i>
<i>for everything.</i>

1107
01:03:05,362 --> 01:03:07,729
<i>David fair: You know,</i>
<i>he would figure out shots,</i>
<i>he'd change angles.</i>

1108
01:03:07,731 --> 01:03:11,799
<i>I mean, at the beginning</i>
<i>of the evening it was</i>
<i>a film I had in mind.</i>

1109
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:15,803
<i>Very soon it became,</i>
<i>you know,</i>
<i>somebody else's film.</i>

1110
01:03:15,805 --> 01:03:16,970
Film the... the chair, okay?

1111
01:03:16,972 --> 01:03:18,871
<i>The highlight probably, though,</i>

1112
01:03:18,873 --> 01:03:20,038
<i>was when Daniel</i>
<i>started playing the songs.</i>

1113
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,541
<i>I mean, at one point</i>
<i>when he started weeping,</i>
<i>you know, this is...</i>

1114
01:03:23,543 --> 01:03:26,710

<i>really seemed strange.</i>

1122
01:03:56,537 --> 01:03:59,371
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>he seemed different</i>

1123
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:01,406

<i>all week long.</i>

1124
01:04:01,408 --> 01:04:05,443

<i>in Chester, uh, West Virginia,</i>

1126

<i>And whatever he was saying</i>

1143

<i>like yoko ono.</i>

1161

1162
01:07:29,393 --> 01:07:31,626
<i>He wanted to be a spokesperson</i>

he's doing his meds,

<i>for a couple of weeks</i>
<i>before the performance.</i>

1206
01:09:40,867 --> 01:09:43,834

01:12:05,783 --> 01:12:10,285
<i>And you could hear girls</i>
<i>in the audience screaming,</i>
<i>"yes!"</i>

1255
01:12:10,287 --> 01:12:11,786

<i>Bill: He was</i>
<i>the hit of that show.</i>

1275
01:13:21,278 --> 01:13:25,613
<i>He got standing ovations.</i>
<i>Nobody else did.</i>

1276
01:13:25,615 --> 01:13:28,983
<i>But then, he was feeling funny.</i>

1277
01:13:30,353 --> 01:13:33,921
<i>And right after his</i>
<i>last performance we left.</i>

1278
01:13:33,923 --> 01:13:38,659
<i>We passed up interviews</i>

(Feuerzeig speaking)

1282
01:14:02,748 --> 01:14:04,013
Well...

1283
01:14:04,015 --> 01:14:09,485
It shouldn't have happened,
but Dan was secretly
duckin' his medicine.

1284
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:13,489
I was giving it to him,
but he was chuckin' it.

1285
01:14:19,363 --> 01:14:22,430
(Feuerzeig speaking)

1286
01:14:33,276 --> 01:14:35,242
Captain America?

1287
01:14:36,878 --> 01:14:37,409
(Clears throat)

1288
01:14:37,411 --> 01:14:41,446
No, he thought he was Casper.
He was reading
a <i> Casper</i> comic book.

1289
01:14:41,448 --> 01:14:44,949
<i>There's a picture</i>
<i>on the front of the book,</i>

1290
01:14:44,951 --> 01:14:47,685
<i>of Casper and a parachute.</i>

1291
01:14:47,753 --> 01:14:51,788
<i>And Dan decided,</i>
<i>"let's... let's bail out.</i>

1292
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:54,657
<i>"Let's jump out."</i>
<i>I said, "no. We can't do that.</i>

1293
01:14:54,659 --> 01:14:56,258
<i>"We don't have</i>
<i>any parachutes."</i>

1294
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,093
<i>So his mind was gone.</i>

1295
01:14:58,095 --> 01:15:01,062
Eventually,
he took the key out,

1296
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:04,832
turned the engine off,
and threw the key
out the window.

1297
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,266
Feuerzeig: How did you
recover the flight?

1298
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:10,570
Well, he grabbed the controls,
took the plane away from me.

1299
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:12,872
He's stronger than me.

1300
01:15:12,874 --> 01:15:17,509
We were kind of
going straight up
and then straight down.

1301
01:15:17,511 --> 01:15:22,814
But he kind of let go
in time for me to get it
out of the spin.

1302
01:15:24,918 --> 01:15:27,518
Nothing down there but trees.

1303
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:33,823
(Clears throat) But I'd had
training on ditching in trees,

1304
01:15:34,926 --> 01:15:35,591
so I didn't stall it in,

1305
01:15:35,593 --> 01:15:40,062
I flew it into the trees,
between two big ones.

1306
01:15:41,432 --> 01:15:43,498
<i>And we got out safe.</i>

1307
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,534
<i>But the plane was a total loss.</i>

1308
01:15:46,536 --> 01:15:49,570
<i>The family came</i>
<i>and got us, got me.</i>

1309
01:15:49,572 --> 01:15:53,140
<i>We put him in a hospital</i>
<i>and left him there</i>
<i>for five months.</i>

1310
01:15:53,142 --> 01:15:55,275
There's Dan.
He's had a good time,

1311
01:15:55,277 --> 01:16:00,179
because he thought
that was great,
coming down in a spin.

1312
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:01,947
He was all mixed-up.

1313
01:16:01,949 --> 01:16:03,882
He felt like he did
something good

1314
01:16:03,884 --> 01:16:06,050
and he wanted us
to be proud of him.

1315
01:16:06,052 --> 01:16:11,422
There's Dan being rolled into
the emergency room.

1316
01:16:11,424 --> 01:16:13,924
They passed a church of Christ,

1317
01:16:13,926 --> 01:16:17,227
and to bill and dick's
amazement,

1318
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:19,762
this sign was
on the church of Christ

1319
01:16:19,764 --> 01:16:22,030
bulletin board out front.

1320
01:16:22,032 --> 01:16:25,466

01:16:25,468 --> 01:16:29,002

<i>He had had the shirt</i>

1338
01:17:47,306 --> 01:17:49,205

1346
01:18:06,055 --> 01:18:11,224
It was just incredible
that a... a t-shirt could
fuel this kind of a frenzy.

1347
01:18:11,226 --> 01:18:14,026
The t-shirt had many, many
thousands of fans

1348
01:18:14,028 --> 01:18:15,894
that wanted to know
more about the t-shirt.

1349
01:18:15,896 --> 01:18:18,696
And wanted to
hear the t-shirt,
and see the t-shirt

1350
01:18:18,698 --> 01:18:19,496
and get to know
the t-shirt.

1351
01:18:19,498 --> 01:18:24,033
<i>Meanwhile, Daniel's</i>
<i>in a hospital and has</i>
<i>no idea who nirvana even is.</i>

01:18:24,035 --> 01:18:25,367
<i>And within a matter of days,</i>

1353
01:18:25,369 --> 01:18:28,036

<i>ended with him saying,</i>

1356
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:35,108
<i>"well, I'd really</i>
<i>like to sign Daniel."</i>

1357
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:39,212
<i>Terry and I met for</i>
<i>a couple of days, hung out</i>
<i>and discussed, uh, everything</i>

1358
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,112
<i>that needed to be discussed.</i>

1359
01:18:40,114 --> 01:18:43,315

<i>take him over to the hospital</i>
<i>and meet with Daniel.</i>

1360
01:18:43,317 --> 01:18:44,549
<i>And we sat in the waiting room,</i>

1361
01:18:44,551 --> 01:18:47,518
<i>Daniel came out, and we had</i>
<i>a business meeting for</i>
<i>about 30, 45 minutes,</i>

1362
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,154
<i>and it went as well as</i>
<i>a meeting can possibly go</i>
<i>in a mental institution</i>

1363
01:18:51,156 --> 01:18:55,424
<i>between a vice president</i>
<i>of a record label</i>
<i>and a patient.</i>

1364
01:18:55,426 --> 01:18:56,792
<i>We were trying to</i>
<i>structure a contract</i>

1365
01:18:56,794 --> 01:19:00,362
<i>that took his</i>
<i>delicate situation</i>
<i>into consideration.</i>

1366
01:19:00,364 --> 01:19:03,898
<i>It's not every day that</i>
<i>a major label signs somebody</i>

1367
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,165
<i>who's in a mental institution.</i>

1368
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:06,733
<i>They were looking out</i>
<i>for Daniel's best interests.</i>

1369
01:19:06,735 --> 01:19:11,337
<i>There was a clause in there</i>
<i>about his mental health,</i>
<i>about providing a doctor,</i>

1370
01:19:11,339 --> 01:19:13,005
<i>about how he would</i>
<i>never have to tour,</i>

1371
01:19:13,007 --> 01:19:17,075
<i>about how he could</i>
<i>never be dropped for</i>
<i>failure to promote a record.</i>

1372
01:19:17,077 --> 01:19:19,343
<i>And they looked at it</i>
<i>as a long-term project.</i>

1373
01:19:19,345 --> 01:19:22,245
<i>It wouldn't be</i>
<i>just one record,</i>
<i>it would be a career.</i>

1374
01:19:22,247 --> 01:19:26,983
<i>It was probably the most</i>
<i>one-sided contract in</i>
<i>the favor of artists' rights</i>

1375
01:19:26,985 --> 01:19:29,685
<i>that had ever been drawn up,</i>
<i>up until that time.</i>

1376
01:19:29,687 --> 01:19:33,488
<i>We obviously had to</i>
<i>get Daniel well, get him</i>
<i>out of the hospital.</i>

1377
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:37,391
<i>And over the next few months,</i>
<i>Daniel continued to improve,</i>

1378
01:19:37,393 --> 01:19:38,625
<i>but it was very slow.</i>

1379
01:19:38,627 --> 01:19:41,227
<i>We bided our time,</i>
<i>did what we could for him</i>

1380
01:19:41,229 --> 01:19:44,763
<i>and just kept waiting</i>
<i>for the day</i>
<i>when he would be released.</i>

1381
01:19:44,765 --> 01:19:48,967
<i>Yves beauvais of</i>
<i>Atlantic records contacted me</i>
<i>around that time,</i>

1382
01:19:48,969 --> 01:19:51,002
<i>wanting to know</i>
<i>what was Daniel's situation.</i>

1383
01:19:51,004 --> 01:19:54,472
<i>And I told him,</i>
<i>"well, we're fairly close</i>
<i>to signing with Elektra."</i>

1384
01:19:54,474 --> 01:19:58,409
<i>His boss, Danny goldberg,</i>
<i>who was the head</i>
<i>of Atlantic records,</i>

1385
01:19:58,411 --> 01:20:00,778
<i>formerly worked with</i>
<i>Kurt cobain as their manager.</i>

1386
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:03,680
<i>And he, uh, wasn't familiar</i>
<i>with Daniel's music,</i>

1387
01:20:03,682 --> 01:20:06,649
<i>but he certainly knew</i>
<i>who the guy</i>
<i>in the t-shirt was.</i>

1388
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:10,686
And the next thing you know,
I've got a bidding war
on my hands.

1389
01:20:10,688 --> 01:20:11,920
Daniel's in a mental hospital

1390
01:20:11,922 --> 01:20:15,056
<i>and I've got two major labels</i>
<i>trying to outbid each other.</i>

1391
01:20:15,058 --> 01:20:18,859
<i>Suddenly, we're looking</i>
<i>at a $100,000 possibility.</i>

1392
01:20:18,861 --> 01:20:23,096
<i>Once Daniel was released</i>
<i>from the hospital, I was</i>
<i>trying to get help for him.</i>

1393
01:20:23,098 --> 01:20:26,199
<i>I was working with his</i>
<i>parents, trying to make</i>
<i>doctor's appointments for him.</i>

1394
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:30,269
<i>And Daniel thought he was</i>
<i>fine. He did not want to</i>
<i>see the doctor.</i>

1395
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:32,471
<i>And Elektra wanted him</i>
<i>to sign this contract</i>

1396
01:20:32,473 --> 01:20:35,240
<i>and Daniel was</i>
<i>paranoid about that.</i>

1397
01:20:35,242 --> 01:20:37,342
He was afraid that
Elektra was satanic.

1398
01:20:37,344 --> 01:20:40,211
Um, they had a band
on their roster
called metallica.

1399
01:20:40,213 --> 01:20:43,013
<i>He was concerned that</i>
<i>they were going to</i>
<i>beat him and kill him.</i>

1400
01:20:43,015 --> 01:20:47,050
<i>And, uh, he could not be</i>
<i>convinced that he was safe.</i>

1401
01:20:47,052 --> 01:20:49,719
<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>

1402
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,526
His delusions would
just not go away.

1403
01:20:57,528 --> 01:21:01,863
He was convinced
that Elektra was evil
and that I was evil.

1404
01:21:01,865 --> 01:21:05,633
Elektra had to be evil
because they were tied to me.

1405
01:21:05,635 --> 01:21:06,767

1425
01:22:03,951 --> 01:22:05,984

over the years,

1429
01:22:14,026 --> 01:22:15,592

specifically,

1430
01:22:15,594 --> 01:22:18,294
that it's hard to tell
which one actually counted.

1431

to work things out,

1432
01:22:20,965 --> 01:22:23,198

<i>So, I decided to</i>
<i>make the record.</i>

1560
01:29:45,873 --> 01:29:49,040
<i>And it was so fun</i>
<i>working with material</i>
<i>that was so good.</i>

1561
01:29:49,042 --> 01:29:51,342
<i>And it's probably</i>
<i>the best thing</i>
<i>I've ever done.</i>

1562
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:56,847
<i>And, if I'm remembered</i>
<i>for anything ever,</i>
<i>it will be for that record.</i>

1563
01:29:56,849 --> 01:29:59,015
<i>Jeff: After the</i> fun
<i>and Kathy mccarty release,</i>

1564
01:29:59,017 --> 01:30:00,950
<i>Daniel and I did not talk</i>
<i>for four years.</i>

1565
01:30:00,952 --> 01:30:02,217
<i>I went into</i>
<i>such a deep depression</i>

1566
01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:04,619
<i>that I just wanted to have</i>
<i>nothing to do with the guy.</i>

1567
01:30:04,621 --> 01:30:06,787
<i>I really could not even</i>
<i>listen to his music.</i>

1568
01:30:06,789 --> 01:30:09,189
<i>But I still had</i>
<i>this fascination</i>
<i>with his artwork.</i>

1569
01:30:09,191 --> 01:30:13,860
<i>I continued to compile</i>
<i>my collection purchasing</i>
<i>drawings from other sources.</i>

1570
01:30:13,862 --> 01:30:15,561
How's it going?
Man: How you doing today?

1571
01:30:15,563 --> 01:30:16,562
Pretty good.
Seen Daniel lately?

1572
01:30:16,564 --> 01:30:17,996
Actually, he came by
a few months ago.

1573
01:30:17,998 --> 01:30:19,163
We're almost out
of what he brought us.

1574
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:22,099
I'll take what I can get.
The black and white ones.

1575
01:30:22,101 --> 01:30:22,866
Oh, yeah, not bad at all.

1576
01:30:22,868 --> 01:30:25,134
<i>Jeff: I was</i>
<i>occasionally contacted by</i>
<i>galleries around the world,</i>

1577
01:30:25,136 --> 01:30:28,871
wanting to show his art,
and if it sounded like
a good thing,

1578
01:30:28,873 --> 01:30:29,771
I would help them out.

1579
01:30:29,773 --> 01:30:34,642
<i>We had shows in Berlin,</i>
<i>eindhoven, Paris, Barcelona,</i>

1580
01:30:34,644 --> 01:30:37,711
<i>London, Manchester,</i>
<i>New York City,</i>

1581
01:30:37,713 --> 01:30:39,412
<i>Washington D.C.,</i>
<i>Los Angeles.</i>

1582
01:30:39,414 --> 01:30:43,048
<i>There were really</i>
<i>more than I could count,</i>
<i>during these four years</i>

1583
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:45,850
<i>that Daniel and I were</i>
<i>not even talking.</i>

1584
01:30:45,852 --> 01:30:48,719
<i>He was beginning to get</i>
<i>reviewed in art magazines</i>

1585
01:30:48,721 --> 01:30:53,223
<i>and his art was becoming</i>
<i>as well known as his music.</i>

1586
01:30:53,225 --> 01:30:55,191
(Phone ringing)

1587
01:30:55,459 --> 01:30:56,524
John: Zero one.

1588
01:30:56,526 --> 01:31:00,828
Uh, do we know for sure
what time Daniel's
actually gonna play?

1589
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:03,330
I sort of said around 9:00.
Yeah, okay. Yeah, 9:00.

1590
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:06,866
<i>We're at the corner</i>
<i>of Melrose and LA brea.</i>

1591
01:31:06,868 --> 01:31:08,968
<i>He's here right now.</i>

1592
01:31:10,438 --> 01:31:14,807
You wanna get some tape, don,
and we can get started?

1593
01:31:15,209 --> 01:31:17,375
<i>John: The hardest thing</i>
<i>to find in art</i>

1594
01:31:17,377 --> 01:31:20,411
<i>is somebody that comes up</i>
<i>with something new,</i>

1595
01:31:20,413 --> 01:31:22,246
<i>somebody completely original.</i>

1596
01:31:22,248 --> 01:31:25,983
Don: No, it's double stick,
so you can put it on the back.

1597
01:31:25,985 --> 01:31:27,317
Oh.

1598
01:31:27,319 --> 01:31:30,653
I'm not looking for people
that are part of movements
that much.

1599
01:31:30,655 --> 01:31:33,489
I... I'm more interested
in people who are
their own movement

1600
01:31:33,491 --> 01:31:34,857
or they're moving
beyond any movement.

1601
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:39,294
Or, you know, are doing
things that no movement
has thought of.

1602
01:31:39,296 --> 01:31:43,231
<i>I think Daniel johnston</i>
<i>is his own movement.</i>

1603
01:31:43,233 --> 01:31:45,499
<i>He's doing things</i>
<i>as original in his way</i>

1604
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:47,801
<i>as Joseph Cornell</i>
<i>did or westerman</i>

1605
01:31:47,803 --> 01:31:51,538
<i>or even going back</i>
<i>to marcel duchamp or man ray</i>

1606
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:54,073
<i>or somebody that just</i>
<i>comes up with stuff that,</i>

1607
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:57,109
<i>you know,</i>
<i>who would've thought it?</i>

1608
01:31:57,511 --> 01:32:01,246
<i>Well, I think it's wrong</i>
<i>to put him in that</i>
<i>outsider art thing.</i>

1609
01:32:01,248 --> 01:32:04,182
<i>He's as much as an inside</i>
<i>as any major artist.</i>

1610
01:32:04,184 --> 01:32:08,853
<i>He's just going in his</i>
<i>own direction,</i>
<i>doing his own thing,</i>

1611
01:32:08,855 --> 01:32:10,387
<i>which more artists should do.</i>

1612
01:32:10,389 --> 01:32:14,691
An unidentified collector
has just bought

1613
01:32:14,693 --> 01:32:17,694
98% of the show.

1614
01:32:17,696 --> 01:32:19,829
<i>And the show has</i>
<i>not even started yet.</i>

1615
01:32:19,831 --> 01:32:23,766
We've sold practically
every drawing that he brought,

1616
01:32:23,768 --> 01:32:25,667
except for four.
That's what happened so far.

1617
01:32:25,669 --> 01:32:31,339
(Stammering)
And the show has just, uh...
You know, we haven't...

1618
01:32:31,474 --> 01:32:32,139
Nobody's showed up yet.

1619
01:32:32,141 --> 01:32:33,974
You know, we're gonna
have to start taking orders,
I guess.

1620
01:32:33,976 --> 01:32:37,177
I mean, last year
his stuff sold pretty fast
but not this fast.

1621
01:32:37,179 --> 01:32:40,647
Daniel: Yeah, there are
some themes. You know,
I mean, with the artwork.

1622
01:32:40,649 --> 01:32:43,816
I do some captain americas,
you know, some ducks.

1623
01:32:43,818 --> 01:32:46,218
I do a lot of ducks
and they're like my armies

1624
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:51,623
and sometimes I use them
in my battles against Satan.

1625
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:02,500
<i>Jeff: Daniel's art mirrors</i>
<i>his songwriting in many ways.</i>

1626
01:33:02,502 --> 01:33:04,935
<i>The same characters,</i>
<i>the same themes.</i>

1627
01:33:04,937 --> 01:33:08,305
<i>There are plenty of drawings</i>
<i>that refer to unrequited love.</i>

1628
01:33:08,307 --> 01:33:12,275
<i>You'll find the same</i>
<i>characters such as Casper</i>
<i>the friendly ghost,</i>

1629
01:33:12,277 --> 01:33:15,544
<i>captain America.</i>
<i>Frankenstein appears</i>
<i>quite often.</i>

1630
01:33:15,546 --> 01:33:20,916
<i>You have Joe the boxer</i>
<i>and the eternal struggle,</i>
<i>the eternal battle.</i>

1631
01:33:20,918 --> 01:33:23,685
<i>For two years,</i>
<i>all Daniel drew were</i>
<i>fight scenes</i>

1632
01:33:23,687 --> 01:33:25,520
<i>of a boxer fighting</i>
<i>a creature in the ring.</i>

1633
01:33:25,522 --> 01:33:29,590
<i>The boxer clearly</i>
<i>represented Daniel while</i>
<i>the, uh, creature was evil.</i>

1634
01:33:29,592 --> 01:33:33,493
<i>This was</i> vile corrupt
<i>from the</i> hi, how are you
<i>album.</i>

1635
01:33:33,495 --> 01:33:34,360
<i>(Bell ringing)</i>

1636
01:33:34,362 --> 01:33:36,562
<i>(People screaming)</i>

1637
01:33:37,898 --> 01:33:42,700
<i>The piece titled</i>
Daniel johnston's symbolical
visions <i> is in many ways</i>

1638
01:33:42,702 --> 01:33:43,867
<i>the rosetta stone</i>
<i>of Daniel's art.</i>

1639
01:33:43,869 --> 01:33:49,005
<i>It has all the figures</i>
<i>and symbols that appear</i>
<i>in so many of his drawings.</i>

1640
01:33:49,007 --> 01:33:52,608
<i>From Kathy mccarty's glasses,</i>
<i>to a baby block,</i>

1641
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:56,545
<i>to the man with</i>
<i>the sawed-off head, to torsos.</i>

1642
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:58,713
<i>All of the familiar figures</i>
<i>are there,</i>

1643
01:33:58,715 --> 01:34:01,716
<i>666, eyes, the pyramid.</i>

1644
01:34:01,718 --> 01:34:05,186
<i>If you listen to</i>
<i>all of Daniel's music</i>
<i>and know the songs</i>

1645
01:34:05,188 --> 01:34:08,989
<i>and then look at the drawings,</i>
<i>they have added meaning.</i>

1646
01:34:08,991 --> 01:34:12,225
<i>Bill: Sometimes it's</i>
<i>very hard to fathom</i>
<i>what goes on his mind.</i>

1647
01:34:12,227 --> 01:34:17,163
<i>I can see what he's thinking</i>
<i>just day by day</i>
<i>in his drawings.</i>

1648
01:34:17,165 --> 01:34:20,332
<i>He will, uh, put captions</i>
<i>on his drawings</i>

1649
01:34:20,334 --> 01:34:23,401
<i>that are coming</i>
<i>right from deep inside.</i>

1650
01:34:23,403 --> 01:34:26,270
<i>And, uh, by looking over his</i>
<i>shoulder every day,</i>

1651
01:34:26,272 --> 01:34:30,474
<i>I can get a little bit</i>
<i>of what goes on in his mind.</i>

1652
01:34:30,476 --> 01:34:36,880
A friend of mine that saw
his art that's in the mental
health field said,

1653
01:34:38,183 --> 01:34:42,285
"I know Daniel's going
to heaven, he's already
been to hell."

1654
01:34:42,287 --> 01:34:46,689
<i>She was lookin' at</i>
<i>the artwork and she said,</i>
<i>"this is hellacious.</i>

1655
01:34:46,691 --> 01:34:51,226
<i>"I mean, someone tortured..."</i>
<i>And I don't even see it</i>
<i>that way.</i>

1656
01:34:51,228 --> 01:34:54,062
<i>A lot of his artwork I see</i>
<i>as very happy</i>

1657
01:34:54,064 --> 01:34:56,397
<i>and he really believes in love.</i>

1658
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:58,799
<i>I think he looks for</i>
<i>that superhero idea</i>

1659
01:34:58,801 --> 01:35:03,537
<i>of someone's gonna rescue</i>
<i>or save and be the good guy.</i>

1660
01:35:03,872 --> 01:35:06,672
It's not really
a coincidence but,

1661
01:35:06,674 --> 01:35:08,240
I did a tribute album
of Daniel's songs

1662
01:35:08,242 --> 01:35:11,009
and later I went on to marry
Daniel's best friend.

1663
01:35:11,011 --> 01:35:13,378
<i>The very first time I went</i>
<i>to Daniel's apartment,</i>

1664
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,380
<i>Daniel handed me</i>
<i>a book of poetry and said,</i>

1665
01:35:15,382 --> 01:35:16,180
<i>"oh, you might like this.</i>

1666
01:35:16,182 --> 01:35:18,348
<i>"These are my friend Dave's</i>
<i>poems. Why don't you</i>
<i>read them?"</i>

1667
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:21,217
<i>And I loved them.</i>
<i>He was instantly</i>
<i>my favorite poet.</i>

1668
01:35:21,219 --> 01:35:24,787
Two or three years after
<i>dead dog's eyeball</i>
came out,

1669
01:35:24,789 --> 01:35:28,290
<i>Dave emailed me and said,</i>
<i>"hi, this is Dave thornberry.</i>

1670
01:35:28,292 --> 01:35:29,024
<i>"Do you remember me?"</i>

1671
01:35:29,026 --> 01:35:30,625
<i>And I wrote him back like,</i>
<i>"do I remember you?</i>

1672
01:35:30,627 --> 01:35:31,993
<i>"I read your poems</i>
<i>all the time, still."</i>

1673
01:35:31,995 --> 01:35:36,030
<i>And I went to visit him,</i>
<i>and as soon as we were</i>
<i>together,</i>

1674
01:35:36,032 --> 01:35:38,399
<i>it was like, we have to</i>
<i>get married. And we did.</i>

1675
01:35:38,401 --> 01:35:42,603
<i>And it was very romantic.</i>
<i>We got married two days</i>
<i>after we saw each other</i>

1676
01:35:42,605 --> 01:35:45,806
<i>for the first time in 13 years.</i>

1677
01:35:47,209 --> 01:35:49,509
<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>

1678
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:17,703
<i>Kathy: Daniel never really</i>
<i>talked to me directly</i>
<i>about Laurie.</i>

1679
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:20,672
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>I knew that all the songs</i>
<i>were about someone.</i>

1680
01:36:20,674 --> 01:36:23,608
<i>I mean, I knew that he had</i>
<i>loved and lost, you know,</i>
<i>in his life.</i>

1681
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:27,378
<i>And I don't think I even</i>
<i>ever really thought that</i>
<i>all those songs</i>

1682
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:28,512
<i>were about the same person.</i>

1683
01:36:28,514 --> 01:36:30,814
<i>But after we had broke up,</i>
<i>so to speak,</i>

1684
01:36:30,816 --> 01:36:34,617
<i>I began to know</i>
<i>more about Laurie.</i>
<i>He talked more about Laurie.</i>

1685
01:36:34,619 --> 01:36:37,953
<i>And I began to know like,</i>
<i>how huge an obsession,</i>

1686
01:36:37,955 --> 01:36:39,821
<i>his obsession with Laurie was.</i>

1687
01:36:39,823 --> 01:36:43,157
¶ Love could save me somehow ¶

1688
01:36:43,159 --> 01:36:46,193
¶ but I just can't make it ¶

1689
01:36:46,295 --> 01:36:47,694
<i>Daniel: Most of my songs</i>
<i>are about her.</i>

1690
01:36:47,696 --> 01:36:51,798
<i>You know, because she does,</i>
<i>did, and hopefully</i>
<i>will love me,</i>

1691
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,698
<i>you know, it keeps me goin'.</i>

1692
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:57,669
<i>I'm always thinking about</i>
<i>another angle about it</i>
<i>when I'm writing a song.</i>

1693
01:36:57,671 --> 01:37:02,373
<i>I think art has always been</i>
<i>inspired by beauty.</i>

1694
01:37:03,442 --> 01:37:07,744
<i>I think there have been</i>
<i>many artists, uh,</i>
<i>throughout history</i>

1695
01:37:07,746 --> 01:37:09,312
<i>who had a major inspiration,</i>

1696
01:37:09,314 --> 01:37:14,116
<i>whether it was a girl,</i>
<i>or even just a philosophy.</i>

1697
01:37:15,586 --> 01:37:18,987
<i>That's what I like</i>
<i>about life and about art.</i>

1698
01:37:18,989 --> 01:37:23,091
<i>Is that when you write a song,</i>
<i>it's just the way</i>
<i>that you saw it</i>

1699
01:37:23,093 --> 01:37:24,492
<i>or just the way that it was.</i>

1700
01:37:24,494 --> 01:37:28,696
<i>I think art is</i>
<i>the greatest frame of mind</i>

1701
01:37:28,698 --> 01:37:33,267
<i>to express a certain feeling</i>
<i>and you'll always</i>
<i>have that feeling.</i>

1702
01:37:33,269 --> 01:37:34,601
<i>It's always there.</i>

1703
01:37:34,603 --> 01:37:36,102
<i>¶ So magical ¶</i>

1704
01:37:36,104 --> 01:37:42,141
<i>David: Laurie is... is</i>
<i>his muse but in a completely</i>
<i>passive way.</i>

1705
01:37:42,143 --> 01:37:44,810
<i>Laurie is the 17 syllables</i>
<i>of haiku</i>

1706
01:37:44,812 --> 01:37:46,411
<i>for him to hang his</i>
<i>creativity on.</i>

1707

1712
01:38:01,726 --> 01:38:04,359

<i>and it came back</i>
<i>more intense later on</i>

1714

1732
01:39:46,884 --> 01:39:48,850

<i>that breaks my heart</i>
<i>about Daniel's life.</i>

1735
01:39:54,356 --> 01:39:57,757
Daniel told me that
he was sorry about the way
he had treated me

1736
01:39:57,759 --> 01:39:59,925
and he admitted that
I had been unjustly fired,

1737
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:02,527
and he told me
that he was not right
mentally at that time.

1738
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:07,164
And he really said
all the things you would
hope to hear from somebody

1739
01:40:07,166 --> 01:40:09,599
who had behaved
the way he had behaved.

1740
01:40:09,601 --> 01:40:10,866
He was very sincere

1741
01:40:10,868 --> 01:40:12,734
and I believe he truly felt bad

1742
01:40:12,736 --> 01:40:14,535
about the way things went down
between the two of us.

1743

it's a miracle.
