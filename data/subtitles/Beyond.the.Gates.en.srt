THIS FILM IS BASED ON REAL EVENTS AND
WAS MADE AT THE LOCATION DEPICTED

00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:34,785
RWANDA 1994

4
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:42,204
FOR THIRTY YEARS THE MAJORITY HUTU
GOVERNMENT HAS PERSECUTED THE
MINORITY TUTSI PEOPLE

5
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:48,300
UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE WEST
THE HUTU PRESIDENT HAD RELUCTANTLY AGREED
A DEAL TO SHARE POWER WITH THE TUTSIS

6
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:56,887
THE UN HAS DEPLOYED A SMALL FORCE
AROUND KIGALI, THE CAPITAL
TO MONITOR THE FRAGILE PEACE

7
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:44,235
SHOOTING DOGS

8
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:54,398
ECOLE TECHNIQUE OFFICIELLE
KIGALI, RWANDA 5th APRIL 1994

9
00:01:56,855 --> 00:02:01,683
Marie Motagoma speeds away.
Obviously ETO two lap time triumph.

10
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:03,885
The crowd is going wild here.

11
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:07,798
The crowd... Come on the crowd is going wild!

12
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,299
Thank you. Thank you, crowd.

13
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,383
Look, even the Belgians can't stay away.
There's Capitaine Delon, soldier
and part time pastry chef.

14
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,046
Wave to Capitaine Delon.
Hello captain!

15
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:19,882
Yeah, prodigally hysterical excitement of Belgian.

16
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:22,288
Who said that UN weren't athletic fans? I deny it.

17
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:24,102
Was it someone else?
It certainly wasn't me.

18
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:26,444
And here comes Marie!
She's coming back.

19
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:29,164
It's looking very good for the young lady.

20
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:30,734
Time's fantastic!

21
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,455
I think she'll be able to set
a new world record!

22
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:39,777
We're live now to Francois, a  man on the ground.
What's his analysis so far?

23
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:41,332
Francois.

24
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:43,566
Hey Joe.

25
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:48,092
Okay, great analysis there from our school
groundsman as ever. Thanks for that.

26
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:49,923
And here we are.
Come on, crowd.

27
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:57,458
We're back now with Joe Conor. In the commentary position once again.
And she is in the home strike. And she's looking very good.

28
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,375
She's looking incredibly powerful.

29
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:00,817
She's making all the way round here.

30
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:03,243
And I think she might just do it.

31
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:06,740
Three, two... I can't believe it!

32
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,786
It's a new world record here at the ETO.

33
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:13,916
Are we gonna celebrate
in our traditional fashion?

34
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,855
- Your teacher is crazy.
- I know.

35
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:41,564
Tell me Christopher,
how are your doing these days?

36
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:44,210
Full of the joys of Africa.

37
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:45,706
Tell him we miss him.

38
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:51,780
No Isabel, I don't want you
falling in love with Joe.

39
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,442
He is only here for the year.
I'm not having you pining.

40
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:58,935
For most, it will be fitty.

41
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,276
Chewing the wires again here, ladies.

42
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:09,542
No connection.

43
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:15,629
Bye, ladies.

44
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:41,739
What's this?

45
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,507
It's Ditu.

46
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:44,384
Ditu?

47
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,742
What is Ditu?

48
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,692
The shop is that way, mate.

49
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:52,425
But my father's house is this way.

50
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,615
It will be rude not to visit him.

51
00:04:57,646 --> 00:05:00,764
You know, you wouldn't wanna be in
a hurry in this country, would you.

52
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,842
My father has been making banana bier.

53
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,185
Whatever happens next,
let him make you try it.

54
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,277
- Why?
- It's disgusting.

55
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,231
He says: 'Do you want to drink?'

56
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,639
Yeah.

57
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:54,765
That is disgusting.

58
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,052
Oh, smell that!

59
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:02,707
What is that, Irish blossom?

60
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:05,883
- I think that smell is from sewage.
- What?

61
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:11,028
You know the problem with you Francois,
is that you never stop and smell the roses.

62
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,337
- What roses?
- Any roses.

63
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:15,578
Tell me where the roses are
and I will smell them.

64
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,874
Hey look, what's that?

65
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,420
- Francois Kuseef.
- Joe!

66
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:35,012
Sex - male.

67
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:37,645
Appaling photographs!

68
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,441
Who were they?

69
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:15,723
Troops.

70
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:45,347
Well, I know you, don't I?
You go to my school sometimes.

71
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,552
Aaron, isn't it?

72
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:49,920
Make it every day next time.

73
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,040
What have you got for me?

74
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:00,810
Passion fruit today.

75
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:08,496
What are those men doing?

76
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:13,414
They’re making a list of
Tutsi families in the area.

77
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:14,576
Really?

78
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:17,311
Hi mom, it's me.

79
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:18,659
Listen to this.

80
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,503
Those are sounds of rush hour in Kigali.

81
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:27,478
I sent you a package last week so
it will be right in the middle of next year.

82
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:29,582
No.

83
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,933
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:36,576
So yes, that's about it, really no use.
I hope your knee is better.

85
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:38,433
I guess I...

86
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:53,052
Rachel. What's the news?

87
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:55,030
I wanna good bier.

88
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:56,408
Not that local shit.

89
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:58,136
Hi, Joe.

90
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:02,246
Two beer.

91
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:03,700
What's the matter?

92
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,423
Penapocachera, covering the peace around here.

93
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,183
Mostly Tutsis.

94
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:14,274
All of a sudden this bunch of Hutu folks
turn out stumbling into Tutsis and shoot.

95
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:16,033
- Shoot?
- Yeah.

96
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,794
And the police just doing 'fuck off'.

97
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:22,577
You alright?

98
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:23,409
Yeah.

99
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,482
This place is supposed to be a point where Hutu and Tutsi can
live together in peace and harmony like Cabernet and Merlot,

100
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:35,138
all blended together into
one glorious Bordeaux.

101
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,867
I guess, Rome wasn't built in a day.

102
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:40,759
Yeah, never will be when your government
says that Tutsis are scum.

103
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,024
So when some old granny gets her face
half sliced, it's obviously Tutsi provocation.

104
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:51,914
Hey Rach, where's my fucking beer?

105
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:55,393
Sorry, Joe.

106
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:58,864
No worries.

107
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,426
God bless.

108
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:37,372
6th APRIL 1994.

109
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:39,396
Alright, come on.
Quiet, please.

110
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:40,784
Quiet.

111
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:42,286
Everybody.

112
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:44,320
Are there any more questions?

113
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:46,136
Yes, George.

114
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:50,334
So is Jesus inside the bread?

115
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:52,468
He's not exactly inside.

116
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:54,299
Then why do you eat him?

117
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:58,380
He's not a sandwich though.

118
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:00,386
That's a very good question.

119
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:03,015
We don't eat him.

120
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:06,897
When we eat the bread
we're taking communion.

121
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:13,563
So, when we're eating the bread
we're also eating the body of Jesus.

122
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:16,658
So he is in the bread.

123
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:20,056
Jesus is in everything.

124
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:28,613
He is in every human heart, everything
we see and touch, everything we feel.

125
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:33,142
Now can anyone tell me
why is Easter important?

126
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:34,291
Marie.

127
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:39,036
Jesus died on the cross and went to heaven
and his father sacrificed him for us.

128
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:41,642
And why did he die on the cross?

129
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:42,731
Because he loved us.

130
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:45,431
Excellent.

131
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,827
Right.

132
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:57,570
Geography I think.
Take your books out.

133
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:02,111
No talking please.

134
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:06,942
Okay. I thought you remember, last week
we're looking on the map on page 15.

135
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:15,161
Councilor Sibomana,
how is life in high politics?

136
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,837
Just in time for the country, father.

137
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,065
Too many challenges.

138
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,448
Indeed.

139
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,353
So what do we owe to the pleasure
of your company today?

140
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:25,361
I thought you could pick up
the equipment you mentioned of.

141
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:27,202
Yes of course.

142
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:34,428
Is there anything more peaceful
than technical college this day?

143
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,133
Yes.

144
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:39,284
Well chaos resumes on Monday.

145
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:40,161
Indeed.

146
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,947
And perhaps even a bit overcrowded
with your guests from the United Nations.

147
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,931
No, it's plenty of room.

148
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:53,364
Well we're certainly indebted
to their presence here.

149
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,486
How many of them are here now?

150
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:02,847
I am not pervaded the
exact numbers, I'm afraid.

151
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:07,360
But not so many that could cause a problem.

152
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:13,021
Well, a delight to see you
as always, Christopher.

153
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,798
And thank you for the hurdles.

154
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,517
- God bless.
- Take care councillor.

155
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,575
How was he?

156
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:25,773
Mercifully brief.

157
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:27,158
What did he want?

158
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,619
He was curious about your
well-being, Charles, as usual.

159
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:39,656
Thanks for your contribution
back there in class.

160
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:41,915
I don't know what I'd have done without you.

161
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,409
It seems to me you're digging
yourself a bit of the hole.

162
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:48,898
Look at that girl, she must run in her sleep.

163
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,990
That girl has a crash on you, I think.

164
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:54,991
What?

165
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:58,625
I think so.

166
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:00,922
It's probably just a phase.

167
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:07,019
Tracking?

168
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:25,428
Boys!

169
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:28,936
Yeah go on, get lost.

170
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:32,303
You're alright?

171
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,314
What's that word "nienzii"?

172
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:38,068
It means cockroaches.

173
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:39,475
Cockroaches?

174
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:42,665
They call all Tutsi cockroaches.

175
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,497
- It's stupid.
- Yeah.

176
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,782
Isn't that your dad?

177
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:59,780
Everyday I see you Joe,
you get a little more African.

178
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:00,770
I'm trying.

179
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:03,028
Will you watch football tonight, Roland?

180
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:05,639
It's Ivory Coast and Nigeria.

181
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:08,367
Nigeria will be wiping up the floor with them.

182
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:12,344
Can place a small bet on that?

183
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:16,075
It wouldn't be fair to take your money, Joe.
It'll be too easy.

184
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:18,164
Lucky for you, I'm a good Christian.

185
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:23,018
- Good bye.
- Bye.

186
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:11,439
What's going on, Charles?

187
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:14,697
Something at the airport.

188
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:33,650
What's going on?

189
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:37,719
The president's plane is down. He's dead.

190
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,295
Was it a shot down or did it crash?

191
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,034
We don't know yet.

192
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:40,990
Is it a coup?

193
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:42,522
Again, we don't know yet.

194
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:45,153
The school is now a weapon situ area.

195
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:47,242
We'll be digging in full-back positions.

196
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:48,975
A full-back from what?

197
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:50,698
It just a precaution.

198
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:51,844
It isn't good.

199
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,091
I had a similar situation in 73.

200
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:55,716
This could well be a coup.

201
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:57,483
Be prepared for that.

202
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,147
What do you think is gonna happen?

203
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:05,247
Well, people will come here for protection,
they'd rather be here with the UN than in their own home.

204
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,055
Francois, what is it?

205
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:09,213
Father Christopher, can I go home now?

206
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:10,642
No, we need you here.

207
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:13,127
Do you want to call home?

208
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:15,553
No thanks, I spoke to my mom last week.

209
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:18,431
I'd call her again if I were you.

210
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:06,706
Did you call your mother?

211
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:09,039
No, there's no international line.

212
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:12,260
Do you think we should call sister Isabel?

213
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:13,384
It's too late.

214
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:17,135
She's been through this before.
We'll call her tomorrow.

215
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:19,978
Do you hear that?

216
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:27,826
It must have been the mortar
or artillery or something.

217
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:32,269
Go to bed and get some rest.

218
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:37,607
Easier said than done.

219
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:41,279
Well try. You're gonna need it.

220
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:43,342
Yeah.

221
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:47,739
- Good night.
- Good night.

222
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,681
I can still call my mom.

223
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:33,724
Father Christopher, there are people at the gates.

224
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:11,625
Tell them to open the gates.

225
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,363
This is a military base.
Not a refuge camp.

226
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:16,427
Actually it's a school.

227
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:18,611
My school.

228
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:47,425
Edda!

229
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:52,014
She says they heard gunshots.

230
00:20:52,015 --> 00:20:58,062
So they decided to go to her brother's.
There were Hutu men on the street with guns...

231
00:20:58,063 --> 00:21:01,263
...looking for Tutsis to kill.

232
00:21:01,264 --> 00:21:03,595
They knew where everybody lived.

233
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:06,815
They had a list.

234
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:16,884
Did you see anyone else
you know from school?

235
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:17,491
No.

236
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:18,491
Okay, I've got a job for you.

237
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:23,531
I want you to go inside, find the phonebook and call everybody
you know from school and tell them to come here, alright?

238
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,883
- Yes.
- Okay.

239
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:47,388
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

240
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:52,365
Francois, come here.

241
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:57,283
Tell him, he can tell me.

242
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,408
No listen, tell him and then he'll tell me.

243
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:22,898
What was that about?

244
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:25,933
I'm Hutu, Joe.

245
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:28,074
The Tutsis hate all Hutu.

246
00:22:28,075 --> 00:22:31,264
They have kids here,
they don't hate you.

247
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,108
Joe, you don't understand.

248
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:35,648
So tell me. Make me understand.

249
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:39,404
The Tutsis want to become masters again.

250
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:41,260
To them we are just slaves.

251
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:43,316
- It's government propaganda.
- It's true, Joe.

252
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:46,391
Those who will not be slaves,
they will kill inside their beds.

253
00:22:46,392 --> 00:22:48,596
You don't believe that shit.

254
00:22:48,597 --> 00:22:52,734
If they can shoot our president,
no Hutu is safe.

255
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:57,044
Hutus must protect themselves or die.

256
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:00,174
I have to go.

257
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:01,294
You will be safe?

258
00:23:01,295 --> 00:23:04,202
I'll go to my father's house.

259
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:13,409
Nobody's answering the phone.

260
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,248
Right, okay. Come on.

261
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,440
The front and back gates have been
fortified and the perimeter is secure.

262
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:25,714
We are apparently hosting 400 - 450 refuges.

263
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:26,948
Mostly Tutsi.

264
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:29,246
We can't cope with many more.

265
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:33,148
There will be more to come. They know
you are here, they’re looking for protection.

266
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:43,770
My order is I'm not to allow this
school to become a safe haven.

267
00:23:46,182 --> 00:23:48,958
But you are peacekeepers.

268
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:52,020
Surely you are here to prevent bloodshed.

269
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,587
Peacekeepers? No.

270
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:59,738
Our mandate is very clear. We are here to monitor
the peace between Hutu and Tutsi. That is all.

271
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,364
Why did you bring all these guns?

272
00:24:03,793 --> 00:24:07,281
Our rules of engagement allow the
use of weapons only in self-defense.

273
00:24:07,282 --> 00:24:13,289
In fact to use the M-2 machine gun, I must even obtain
the approval of the Secretary General himsef.

274
00:24:15,408 --> 00:24:20,352
Our mandate is not to enforce the peace,
but to monitor it.

275
00:24:20,353 --> 00:24:23,466
Alright Capitaine, I can understand the difference.

276
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:26,502
Certainly these people won't.

277
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:32,462
7th APRIL 1994

278
00:24:34,695 --> 00:24:37,584
7 hundred hours,
Greenwich meantime.

279
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:41,294
Violence has broken out in the central
African republic of Rwanda,

280
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:46,768
following the death of Hutu president Juvenal
Habyarimana in a plane crash, yesterday evening.

281
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:54,127
Sources loyal to the government are blaming members of the local
Tutsi minority. They are suspected to attack the plane by rocket fire.

282
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:23,238
White men coming in big car.

283
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:25,919
To make whinings.

284
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:40,190
Christopher, I need to put them
somewhere with facilities.

285
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:43,869
Yes, of course.
We must have the facilities.

286
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:48,405
Last time they had the old offices there.

287
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:50,041
Thank you.

288
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:54,010
- Isn't that nice?
- It's really nice.

289
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:56,238
Can I use a tow truck for a while?

290
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,481
For what?

291
00:25:57,482 --> 00:26:00,485
For Marie and Roland to bring them here.

292
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:02,017
It's not a good idea.

293
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,652
It's two roads there,
it would take a couple of minutes.

294
00:26:04,653 --> 00:26:06,527
Straight there and back.

295
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:25,075
Hello? Anybody home?

296
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,746
Hello, Roland?

297
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:36,108
Marie?

298
00:27:42,017 --> 00:27:43,039
Roland?

299
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:47,815
Marie?

300
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:53,933
Hello.

301
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:55,424
No, I'm a teacher.

302
00:29:23,158 --> 00:29:24,422
Okay.

303
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:59,493
It's really weird out there, Christopher.

304
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:00,494
And I didn't see anybody.

305
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:01,814
That's strange.

306
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:03,881
I'm gonna need your help in the chapel shortly.

307
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:06,775
I couldn't find the Motagomas
and their house was empty.

308
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:08,739
They're over there.
I saw them five minutes ago.

309
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:15,883
Marie, where have you been?
I have just been at your house.

310
00:30:15,884 --> 00:30:18,872
We had to come back way.
They were road-blocks everywhere.

311
00:30:19,404 --> 00:30:21,862
Well you are safe now
and that's what matters.

312
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:27,143
Listen, classrooms are getting pretty busy, why don't you
take my room? It will be much more comfortable for you.

313
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:33,111
Thank you, Joe. But, you see, many of our
neighbors here. I think we should be with them.

314
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,109
You're sure?

315
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,802
Thank you for coming to find us.

316
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:52,874
Surely there's no time to celebrating already.

317
00:30:53,637 --> 00:31:01,707
Well, I just wanted to inform you that I shall be giving a briefing
of the situation as we know it to everyone at 6.00 hours.

318
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,446
Everyone, Charles?

319
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:06,856
The Europeans.

320
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,407
The indication are that it is a coup.

321
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:14,831
There's also a word that the detachment
of French regime may be sent here.

322
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,156
Reinforcements?

323
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:21,653
In case of a need to evacuate.

324
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,561
It may become unattainable to provide
security for these many Tutsi.

325
00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:34,759
Around here we just call them Rwandans.

326
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,844
Who is in charge here?

327
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:41,361
My name is Ingulimziwa.

328
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:44,212
I am the former minister of
this so-called government.

329
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:50,640
And I must tell you that the killing going on
outside is not simply random. This is all planned.

330
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:53,358
You must alert your superiors in New York.

331
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,445
You must intervene.

332
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,602
Sir, we are here as peace monitors, nothing more.

333
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:01,483
There's no mandate for anything else.

334
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:07,587
Captain, you're no doubt aware what
the Nazis attempted to do with the Jews.

335
00:32:07,588 --> 00:32:08,588
Of course.

336
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:10,988
This is what we are facing here.

337
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:15,956
These Hutu extremists, who have taken
control, even call this "the Tutsi problem".

338
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:18,182
They plan to wipe the Tutsi out.

339
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:19,638
Do you understand me?

340
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:20,899
All of them.

341
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:24,412
She says, she was hiding behind her house.

342
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,962
There were Interahamwe in the streets.

343
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:28,682
Intera what?

344
00:32:28,683 --> 00:32:30,485
Militias, gangs of militia.

345
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,888
Interahamwe means "those who strike together".

346
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:37,824
They were checking identity cards, like this.

347
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,577
She said she was very scared
because she's a Tutsi.

348
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:45,373
She saw one woman and her baby girl.

349
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:52,650
They kicked the woman in the stomach
and began to take off her clothes.

350
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:59,596
One of them took the baby by the feet and
swung her against the tree, so the baby hit her had.

351
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:07,659
They kept swinging
until the baby was dead.

352
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:19,743
Listen to me, you are safe here.

353
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:22,249
But I'm Tutsi.

354
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,696
If we all stay together in here then we're safe.
There's too many people here, alright?

355
00:33:28,393 --> 00:33:29,840
Alright?

356
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:32,291
I promise you.

357
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:36,516
There has been some rumour
and speculations around.

358
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:39,551
I'll ask you to disregard anything but the facts.

359
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:42,969
Our best analysis is that a coup has occurred.

360
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:47,393
We've been assured that an government
will be restored very soon in the meantime.

361
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:50,358
We are on full contact with your embassies.

362
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:55,434
And of course an evacuation protocol
is being put into effect.

363
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:56,464
What does he say?

364
00:33:56,465 --> 00:33:59,414
He says everything is going to be alright.

365
00:33:59,415 --> 00:34:02,856
My father would like to speak to you.

366
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:10,816
One at a time.

367
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,331
We have organized ourselves.

368
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:19,008
There will be three groups, one will be security,
watching people who are coming in.

369
00:34:19,112 --> 00:34:22,298
We have some people here
who are embassy workers.

370
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:24,179
And the third group will do food.

371
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,797
Okay good, that's great.

372
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:29,153
We have all agreed that we shall only
have one meal a day. That's at 4 o'clock.

373
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:35,558
So we need a steady food supply and something to measure
the right food. Can you find these things for us, please?

374
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,535
Sure. I can ask father Christopher.

375
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:38,783
- Thank you.
- Okay.

376
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:46,766
Hi.

377
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:52,760
Listen, they’re doing a really good job outside, organizing
themselves, but they're gonna need some stuff from us.

378
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:55,466
Fine. I'll see to that after Mass.

379
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:56,661
The Mass?

380
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:59,232
I am priest in a catholic country, Joe.

381
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:01,715
This is what I do.

382
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:04,494
It's in the job description.

383
00:35:04,495 --> 00:35:05,534
Yeah, sure.

384
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:08,152
Do you think it's the best time for that?

385
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:11,669
Time's a stress, people need to commune with God.

386
00:35:11,814 --> 00:35:13,954
I think maybe they'll prefer some food.

387
00:35:13,955 --> 00:35:15,928
Water, just put a reassurance.

388
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:18,645
Well, come to Mass.

389
00:35:18,646 --> 00:35:21,618
Get all free on the same ticket.

390
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:44,647
It's been a 10th night here
in Rwandan capital Kigali.

391
00:36:44,648 --> 00:36:47,501
The normally bustling streets
are now completely deserted.

392
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:50,838
Except for angry soldiers,
loyal to the former president.

393
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:52,814
...and shooting bodies is becoming common.

394
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:56,794
Militias with machetes and clubs rule the streets.

395
00:36:56,795 --> 00:37:03,752
And what appears to have been a deliberate plan to
massacre Tutsis. Thousands have now been executed.

396
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,414
- Councilor.
- Father Christopher.

397
00:37:09,415 --> 00:37:14,059
These are difficult times,
such uncertainties.

398
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,683
Please, be careful.

399
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:18,583
Tutsis have spies everywhere.

400
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:20,119
Some might even be in your school.

401
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:24,688
I appreciate your concern
for our welfare, councilor.

402
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:28,416
Of course the welfare of
our citizens is paramount.

403
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:34,218
Well, you could deal some blankets,
a fuel for the generator - that sort of thing.

404
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,593
Perhaps tomorrow, my superior
colonel Bugesera has asked...

405
00:37:40,712 --> 00:37:45,423
He has asked me to ask you, perhaps
have a small word with your Belgian guests.

406
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:53,068
My government is uncomfortable with the idea of
United Nation soldiers guarding those poor people in your school.

407
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:56,269
We would prefer Rwandans protecting Rwandans.

408
00:37:58,431 --> 00:38:04,343
Well, I'm not sure that it is my position
to talk to the capitaine about that.

409
00:38:04,344 --> 00:38:07,339
Of course you know him better than I.

410
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,357
Though I'm sure he will listen to you.

411
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:11,787
His mind must be on those missing men.

412
00:38:12,677 --> 00:38:14,529
What missing men?

413
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,573
Ten Belgian UN soldiers.

414
00:38:17,574 --> 00:38:18,870
What?

415
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:22,382
They were kidnapped while
guarding our Prime Minister.

416
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,976
A terrible business, terrible.

417
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:30,280
Well, I'll see what I can do.

418
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:33,822
Thank you.

419
00:38:33,823 --> 00:38:36,207
That would be very nice.

420
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:47,950
Yes it's true. The detachment of 10 soldiers
were protecting the prime minister.

421
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,796
He said they were kidnapped.

422
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:52,380
It's possible. We don't know where they are.

423
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:54,877
So what happened to the prime minister?

424
00:38:54,878 --> 00:38:58,687
She's dead. Murdered.

425
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,528
Look, it might sound weird, right.
But what about this.

426
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:42,395
We could call a bishop and get him to come to this school,
not to give a Mass but for a talk or symbol, you know.

427
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:45,159
It's not gonna make any difference.

428
00:39:46,102 --> 00:39:51,758
Wait a minute, you can think about it.
You know him well so call him, get him round here.

429
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:53,595
I don't think so, Joe.

430
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:56,586
Well look, if he came then what kind
of signal will that send out?

431
00:39:56,587 --> 00:39:57,625
Gods.

432
00:39:57,626 --> 00:39:59,639
I know you don't think we can make a difference.

433
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,189
We passed all that!

434
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,412
If the UN now being targeted.

435
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,090
Then we are way beyond that.

436
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,296
I must call sister Isabel again.

437
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:39,680
What's he saying?

438
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,950
Who will fill the empty graves?

439
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:47,328
The cockroaches are hiding in the churches.

440
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:49,969
They are hiding in the schools.

441
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:23,495
What's going on?

442
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:24,639
Food.

443
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,960
They are discussing how to rush and what's left.

444
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:29,430
Can we have a word?

445
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:37,517
Don't bite my head off,
but I have an idea.

446
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:39,351
Nobody knows what's happening here right?

447
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:42,370
So we should get on the TV cameras.

448
00:41:43,094 --> 00:41:44,946
What would that do?

449
00:41:44,947 --> 00:41:51,322
You know, nothing exist if it's not on TV. So we get the cameras
in here and the rest of the world sees what's happening.

450
00:41:51,323 --> 00:41:52,853
And they'll have to do something.

451
00:41:52,854 --> 00:41:54,107
How do we achieve that?

452
00:41:54,108 --> 00:41:58,603
I can go and get Rachel Watson,
she's with the BBC. Staying at the Morahl.

453
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:03,574
But I can't let you go outside alone.

454
00:42:03,575 --> 00:42:05,811
Fine, I'll get the UN to give me an escort.

455
00:42:06,746 --> 00:42:07,667
Okay.

456
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,604
Great.

457
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:12,979
I'm sorry my central command would never agree.

458
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,716
Charles, your mandate is about peacekeeping.
If you help me get the BBC and that will help to keep the peace.

459
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:20,434
You know that.

460
00:42:20,435 --> 00:42:21,633
Just one vehicle.

461
00:42:21,634 --> 00:42:22,823
Just one.

462
00:42:23,477 --> 00:42:24,297
It's possible.

463
00:42:24,298 --> 00:42:25,447
Give me a minute.

464
00:42:36,843 --> 00:42:38,984
- Charles.
- No escort.

465
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:40,010
But you just said...

466
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:42,097
No escort! Leave now.

467
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:45,268
What a fuck is that!

468
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,962
They don't give me an escort.

469
00:42:48,963 --> 00:42:52,686
I'm going get Francois at his dad's place.
He's Hutu, so, you know.... He's with me.

470
00:42:52,687 --> 00:42:55,683
- Everybody knows this truck anyway.
- Wait here.

471
00:43:06,388 --> 00:43:08,971
Our missing soldiers have been found.

472
00:43:08,972 --> 00:43:12,547
They were taken to a government
barracks and executed.

473
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,011
Executed?

474
00:43:14,012 --> 00:43:15,912
Butchered.

475
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:20,810
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

476
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:27,563
You realize it? No one safety
can be guaranteed now.

477
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:53,064
The time has come to do your duty!

478
00:43:55,846 --> 00:44:01,371
The army cannot do their job alone,
it is up to you the people!

479
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:06,091
Go to the roads.
Work at the roadblocks!

480
00:44:07,888 --> 00:44:09,016
Is Francois here?

481
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:10,524
No thank you.

482
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:11,821
Is Francois ... Thank you.

483
00:44:11,822 --> 00:44:14,515
Francois.

484
00:44:15,963 --> 00:44:18,156
Madame, is your son here?

485
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:47,132
The news are screaming for
two ways every half hour, Joe.

486
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:49,079
From 9 to 3 minutes for me tonight.

487
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,888
There are over 1,5 thousand
people hiding at school.

488
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:56,117
Yeah, there's 2000 Tutsis hiding at Sainte Familie
and God knows how many at the stadium as well.

489
00:44:56,274 --> 00:45:00,263
We also have about 40 Europeans, hiding.

490
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:04,292
When it started off it was just
the army doing the killings.

491
00:45:04,293 --> 00:45:09,779
No it's spreading to everyone, they're all killing
Tutsis - the ordinary people, police, everyone.

492
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,015
I haven't seen such fucking machetes in my life.

493
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:14,515
Fuck, the militia.

494
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:15,799
Interahamwe.

495
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:17,234
Oh, shit!

496
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,829
Everyone around here knows us.

497
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,421
Lucky us.

498
00:45:27,462 --> 00:45:29,209
Stop.

499
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:03,427
Okay.

500
00:46:08,753 --> 00:46:09,546
No.

501
00:46:20,102 --> 00:46:22,464
Just take the tape back.
You push the blue button on the top.

502
00:46:42,689 --> 00:46:43,922
I'll show you...

503
00:46:43,923 --> 00:46:44,767
BBC.

504
00:47:08,586 --> 00:47:10,585
Joe, look at me.

505
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:12,387
Keep looking at me. Alright?

506
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:15,565
Look at me.

507
00:47:22,857 --> 00:47:24,969
Take the fucking tape back!

508
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,448
Joe, look at me.

509
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:30,341
Joe, keep looking at me.
Just at me.

510
00:48:13,126 --> 00:48:14,786
Do you know him?

511
00:48:56,408 --> 00:49:00,431
Well I think that we've crawled the wall,
all things considered.

512
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,960
Wait.

513
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:10,544
Stop.

514
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:12,664
Go back a bit.

515
00:49:17,183 --> 00:49:18,754
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

516
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,630
- They're never gonna show this.
- Just get on taping that.

517
00:50:07,525 --> 00:50:08,638
You're okay?

518
00:50:45,018 --> 00:50:46,932
I heard about the road block.

519
00:50:48,366 --> 00:50:50,771
Not everything.

520
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,776
Francois was there.

521
00:50:54,777 --> 00:50:58,383
He is a killer. He is one of them.

522
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,530
Did you see him kill anyone?

523
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:09,920
He had a machete in his hands it was blood
on the blade. It was... blood on his hands.

524
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:17,841
I'm sorry.

525
00:51:20,993 --> 00:51:24,125
Capitaine Delon, how do you
view the situation now?

526
00:51:24,126 --> 00:51:30,260
Extremist Hutu elements are targeting the
Tutsi minority and anyone who supports them.

527
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:33,912
You know there are people being
killed right outside these gates.

528
00:51:33,913 --> 00:51:35,103
Yes.

529
00:51:35,104 --> 00:51:38,460
So why can't the UN stop this slaughter?

530
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:40,566
We do not have a mandate for that.

531
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:42,834
We can only fire if fired upon.

532
00:51:42,835 --> 00:51:44,627
The parameters of our operation are very clear.

533
00:51:44,628 --> 00:51:47,714
Some people are starting to call this
a genocide. Would you call it that?

534
00:51:48,712 --> 00:51:50,288
Well...

535
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:54,929
Because you know that if this is genocide
you are obligated to intervene.

536
00:51:56,011 --> 00:51:57,641
Stop the camera, please.

537
00:51:57,642 --> 00:51:59,822
Stop it now!

538
00:52:02,402 --> 00:52:04,448
What's going on here
is not my choice, okay?

539
00:52:04,449 --> 00:52:07,199
Being here and doing nothing
is also not my choice.

540
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,844
I'm a military commandor with a
mandate to observe. I can do no more.

541
00:52:10,845 --> 00:52:12,197
You are the UN, show it.

542
00:52:12,198 --> 00:52:13,722
But I'm not the Security Council.

543
00:52:13,723 --> 00:52:14,982
They make our mandate.

544
00:52:14,983 --> 00:52:23,172
Why don't you call New York and get a chance, because, let me
tell you, we have tried. And please, let me know how far you get.

545
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,897
There are Interahamwe outside both gates now.

546
00:53:00,372 --> 00:53:03,284
It'd be as well being story surrounded.

547
00:53:04,898 --> 00:53:09,719
You know I just don't understand
why did they kill those UN soldiers?

548
00:53:11,269 --> 00:53:13,427
What a stupid people.

549
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:18,011
They must have known
it'd have repercussions.

550
00:53:18,012 --> 00:53:21,760
Perhaps they wanted repercussions.

551
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:31,915
In Somalia 18 Americans died.
It was enough to force a complete withdraw.

552
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:35,315
As you see these are not stupid people.

553
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:40,726
Will the UN withdraw?
What you think, Charles?

554
00:53:40,727 --> 00:53:43,647
At the moment my orders
are to remain in position.

555
00:53:43,648 --> 00:53:46,042
But if your orders change?

556
00:53:47,638 --> 00:53:48,897
I'm a soldier.

557
00:53:53,554 --> 00:53:56,901
Can't imagine what
it must be like for you.

558
00:53:56,902 --> 00:54:02,874
Whoever wanted to talk.
If any of your men ever wanted to talk.

559
00:54:17,091 --> 00:54:22,307
My grandparents were Belgian, from Mehanen.

560
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:30,202
When the Nazis came through that town, they took
in as many Jews as they could 20, maybe 30 people.

561
00:54:31,193 --> 00:54:42,398
Everyone asked to hand them over. But my grandparents
saved those people. I was always proud of that.

562
00:54:57,099 --> 00:54:59,593
Stop it!

563
00:55:00,709 --> 00:55:02,978
Stop it immediately!

564
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:04,569
What's going here?

565
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,455
He was walking across over there with a machete.

566
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,689
He is Interahamwe.

567
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:20,556
You all stay calm.

568
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:29,521
You all stay calm.

569
00:55:43,475 --> 00:55:45,653
Are you alright?

570
00:55:45,654 --> 00:55:48,139
I'm afraid, Joe.

571
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,740
- Everything's alright here.
- For you maybe.

572
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:57,514
See that woman there, her name is Rachel.
She's with the television crew.

573
00:55:57,515 --> 00:56:02,391
And they gonna film us. If they are
filming us, no one can touch us.

574
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:40,483
You're okay?

575
00:56:44,728 --> 00:56:46,596
Why did you come here?

576
00:56:51,997 --> 00:56:54,018
You know, growing up...

577
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:56,025
I had everything that kid can want.

578
00:56:56,283 --> 00:57:01,245
And... it's just me trying to say
"thank you" I guess.

579
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:07,582
Trying to make a difference.

580
00:57:08,957 --> 00:57:18,780
I know it. I catch myself sometimes thinking
"well done, Joe. You are really doing it."

581
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:23,148
You are starring in your own film.

582
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:28,899
And then there's all this.

583
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:35,333
Last year in Bosnia
I felt exactly the same way.

584
00:57:35,334 --> 00:57:36,382
How was that?

585
00:57:36,383 --> 00:57:37,906
Great actually.

586
00:57:37,907 --> 00:57:39,339
Best stuff I've ever done.

587
00:57:41,928 --> 00:57:43,733
Cried every day.

588
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:50,728
Strangely enough over here... not a tear.

589
00:57:50,729 --> 00:57:54,180
I guess you get on to it.

590
00:57:56,675 --> 00:57:57,639
No.

591
00:57:58,212 --> 00:58:00,305
Just worse than that.

592
00:58:00,306 --> 00:58:10,766
Anytime I saw a dead Bosnian woman,
white woman, I feel... that could be my mom.

593
00:58:10,886 --> 00:58:18,070
Over here they're just dead Africans.

594
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:24,831
All things the same.

595
00:58:26,872 --> 00:58:30,346
We're all just selfish pieces of work.

596
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:37,269
- Shit. What the fuck is that?
- That's all right. It's just the generators.

597
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:40,042
I'm surprised that didn't happen already.

598
00:58:46,518 --> 00:58:47,811
Okay.

599
00:58:53,218 --> 00:58:55,673
- Where is it coming from?
- It's there.

600
00:59:17,217 --> 00:59:19,473
Breathe and push!

601
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:21,306
Good girl.

602
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,843
Breathe.

603
00:59:22,844 --> 00:59:25,306
Push!

604
00:59:25,307 --> 00:59:27,336
Breathe and push.

605
00:59:27,337 --> 00:59:28,134
Remember to breathe.

606
00:59:28,135 --> 00:59:28,971
Push!

607
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:30,560
We have the head.

608
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:32,953
Push!

609
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:34,839
Oh yes. Push!

610
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,765
Push Edda, you are doing really well. Come on.

611
00:59:36,766 --> 00:59:41,382
Push!

612
00:59:59,136 --> 01:00:02,460
She wants to call the baby Christopher.

613
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:08,121
Thank you.

614
01:00:47,706 --> 01:00:50,498
I think, Christopher is an awful name.

615
01:00:52,964 --> 01:00:55,972
The fathers at Yamata have been murdered.

616
01:00:55,973 --> 01:00:57,944
In that church.

617
01:00:58,998 --> 01:01:00,119
What?

618
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:02,445
Father Jean?

619
01:01:02,446 --> 01:01:07,565
And all the parishioners. Hacked to death.

620
01:01:07,693 --> 01:01:09,290
Jesus Christ.

621
01:01:13,366 --> 01:01:16,307
I have not seen this before.

622
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,756
Did you get to the convent?

623
01:01:21,757 --> 01:01:23,801
The line is dead.

624
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,116
What you're doing?

625
01:01:33,778 --> 01:01:36,923
I've set Mass every Monday
with that convent for 12 years.

626
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,551
Christopher.

627
01:01:39,552 --> 01:01:41,100
I have to go.

628
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:44,374
It's not gonna make any difference
that you're priest or you are white.

629
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:46,673
They don't care who you are anymore.

630
01:01:46,674 --> 01:01:51,311
- I'll be aright.
- You won't be alright. I've been out there and it's falling apart.

631
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:56,434
They might already be dead.

632
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,468
That's not the point.

633
01:02:02,915 --> 01:02:05,115
This baby is not well.

634
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:10,270
He has a fewer.

635
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:13,430
There's also discharge
coming from his eyes.

636
01:02:13,881 --> 01:02:16,271
There's nothing here.

637
01:02:16,272 --> 01:02:18,294
You know exactly what we need?

638
01:02:18,295 --> 01:02:20,110
Yes.

639
01:02:25,043 --> 01:02:28,977
- First the medicine, then the convent.
- You don't have to do this, you know.

640
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,744
Yes I do, Joe.

641
01:03:39,362 --> 01:03:41,716
Good morning, Julius.

642
01:03:42,353 --> 01:03:43,343
Good morning.

643
01:03:43,812 --> 01:03:45,322
I need some medicine.

644
01:03:48,605 --> 01:03:51,111
We have some, I think.

645
01:04:01,066 --> 01:04:03,119
What is the child's name?

646
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,526
Christopher.

647
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:09,708
Do you have the medicine?

648
01:04:09,709 --> 01:04:12,705
And what is the child's address?

649
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:20,979
Do you have the medicine?

650
01:04:27,765 --> 01:04:29,401
Follow me.

651
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,393
This child is Hutu or Tutsi?

652
01:04:47,171 --> 01:04:48,242
Hutu.

653
01:04:51,691 --> 01:04:53,021
Wait here.

654
01:05:21,888 --> 01:05:26,342
I knew I had it.
It will help him.

655
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:30,488
Take a lot of care out there.

656
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,008
Thank you.

657
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:08,539
Father Christopher.

658
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,738
It's me, remember the hurdles?

659
01:06:18,393 --> 01:06:19,686
You see?

660
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,889
Don't.

661
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:32,731
No, it's medicine.

662
01:06:32,732 --> 01:06:35,069
Medicine?

663
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:35,894
It is my medicine.

664
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:49,907
Christopher.

665
01:08:52,676 --> 01:08:56,670
We need you to tell the rest of the school
that we are having problems with the dogs.

666
01:08:56,671 --> 01:08:57,861
Dogs?

667
01:08:57,862 --> 01:09:01,295
The dogs, outside the gate,
eating the bodies.

668
01:09:01,296 --> 01:09:05,381
Can you please just inform everyone
that we have a health problem here.

669
01:09:05,382 --> 01:09:07,737
We are going to shoot the dogs.

670
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,750
If they hear gunshots,
they should not panic. Okay?

671
01:09:10,751 --> 01:09:13,392
Did they open fire?

672
01:09:13,393 --> 01:09:16,704
Did they open fire, Charles?

673
01:09:16,705 --> 01:09:19,091
Did who open fire?

674
01:09:19,092 --> 01:09:21,062
The dogs.

675
01:09:23,478 --> 01:09:25,683
Were they shooting at you?

676
01:09:25,684 --> 01:09:27,286
What are you talking about?

677
01:09:28,009 --> 01:09:37,485
This is according to your mandate, if you are going to shoot
the dogs then the dogs must have been shooting at you first.

678
01:09:37,486 --> 01:09:38,245
Please...

679
01:09:38,246 --> 01:09:39,647
I'll tell you what.

680
01:09:39,648 --> 01:09:45,151
Why don't we just say
'fuck the mandate'?!

681
01:09:45,152 --> 01:09:49,358
And when you're finished with this health problem
maybe you'll address the other health problem?

682
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,579
The one over there!

683
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:55,909
With that fucking machetes.

684
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:14,325
We have no more fuel for the fire.

685
01:10:17,623 --> 01:10:19,355
Use the Bibles.

686
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:23,643
We'd end go around if we share. Come on.

687
01:10:29,273 --> 01:10:31,156
Christopher.

688
01:10:33,052 --> 01:10:35,244
You know what, Joe.

689
01:10:35,383 --> 01:10:39,895
People have been coming to Mass
here for God knows how long.

690
01:10:39,896 --> 01:10:45,252
They get up, they go to church, they sing,
they eat the bread and then they leave.

691
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,055
Do you know why?

692
01:10:49,302 --> 01:10:52,646
Because they are told to.

693
01:10:56,014 --> 01:11:02,386
They just go through the motions without the
slightest understanding of what it is they are engaged in.

694
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:11,002
Whether they are being told to eat a wafer
or hack their own flesh and blood to death.

695
01:11:11,003 --> 01:11:12,901
You are wrong, father.

696
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:16,739
I know you've made a difference.

697
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:22,613
I spent 30 years on this bloody continent.

698
01:11:22,614 --> 01:11:25,536
The only thing we ever had that
ever stayed the same was hope.

699
01:11:26,395 --> 01:11:28,378
I always had hope, Joe.

700
01:11:28,379 --> 01:11:32,773
In fact this is all we ever had.

701
01:11:32,969 --> 01:11:36,360
Now...

702
01:11:36,498 --> 01:11:39,231
...nothing.

703
01:11:39,426 --> 01:11:41,377
We are running dry.

704
01:12:09,413 --> 01:12:14,198
Do you receive, Christopher into
the congregation of Christ's flock?

705
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:18,928
And so sign him with
the sign of the cross.

706
01:12:18,929 --> 01:12:25,091
And intook on that here after he shall not be
ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified.

707
01:12:25,092 --> 01:12:31,855
The man will lead his fight under his
banner against sin, the world and the devil.

708
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:35,520
And he will continue as Christ
faithful soldier and servant...

709
01:12:38,111 --> 01:12:41,804
...until his life's end.

710
01:12:43,221 --> 01:12:43,901
Amen.

711
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:58,278
It's the French.

712
01:14:23,688 --> 01:14:25,839
Bastards, they’re only taking the whites.

713
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,665
What?

714
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:28,403
They are only taking the whites.

715
01:14:28,404 --> 01:14:33,431
- But they can't do it.
- Until your Capitaine stated, they were only taking French.

716
01:14:33,466 --> 01:14:36,639
Excuse me, is there room for me on this truck?

717
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,640
If you hurry up - yes.

718
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:40,847
Then I wanna donate my place to one of
these people. Her name is Marie Motagoma.

719
01:14:40,848 --> 01:14:42,577
No, no Rwandans.

720
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:25,398
Joe, come on, get on this truck.

721
01:15:27,076 --> 01:15:30,496
For fuck sake, Joe, there's
nothing more you can do here.

722
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,610
I'm staying.

723
01:17:10,526 --> 01:17:15,457
I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
creator of heaven and earth.

724
01:17:15,579 --> 01:17:20,645
I believe in Jesus Christ,
his Son, the Lord.

725
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,746
Keep going.

726
01:17:31,892 --> 01:17:33,820
Does he love everyone?

727
01:17:34,485 --> 01:17:38,453
Does he even love those men
on the roads outside?

728
01:17:42,914 --> 01:17:47,159
God does not always
like everything we do.

729
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,956
That's our choice.

730
01:17:49,445 --> 01:17:51,938
But he loves all his children.

731
01:18:04,677 --> 01:18:06,250
Has anybody seen Edda?

732
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:09,866
Edda, the woman with the baby.

733
01:18:10,716 --> 01:18:12,655
Did you see Edda with the baby?

734
01:18:12,656 --> 01:18:16,577
Cause I have a medicine for the baby.

735
01:18:24,855 --> 01:18:27,713
Claude, have you seen Edda or Aaron?

736
01:18:27,714 --> 01:18:29,525
- They are running away.
- What?

737
01:18:29,526 --> 01:18:31,637
- Where?
- Over the back field.

738
01:18:55,732 --> 01:18:57,423
Edda.

739
01:19:53,336 --> 01:19:54,866
Don't cry.

740
01:19:55,447 --> 01:19:57,854
Don't cry.

741
01:20:32,024 --> 01:20:35,675
How much pain can a human being take?

742
01:20:37,603 --> 01:20:44,989
If you feel enough pain,
does everything just shut down?

743
01:20:45,398 --> 01:20:47,002
Before you've done it.

744
01:20:48,006 --> 01:20:50,297
I don't know, Joe.

745
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:52,784
Cause you think no one knew.

746
01:20:52,785 --> 01:20:55,095
You think that it'd be something...

747
01:20:55,096 --> 01:20:58,979
Something that you designed,
you know, shed or fell.

748
01:21:00,476 --> 01:21:03,356
If you feel enough pain.

749
01:21:03,357 --> 01:21:04,963
I hope so.

750
01:21:06,852 --> 01:21:08,804
Yeah, God knows it.

751
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:12,006
Maybe we should ask him.

752
01:21:13,323 --> 01:21:14,707
He's still around.

753
01:21:21,378 --> 01:21:24,573
I think it's time we pack our bags.

754
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,161
Marie.

755
01:22:35,686 --> 01:22:39,618
You'll never leave us, papa Christopher?

756
01:22:44,467 --> 01:22:47,281
Terrible things may happen
in this world, Marie.

757
01:22:47,282 --> 01:22:54,478
But however terrible they are,
you are in my heart.

758
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:59,710
And you will be there until I die.

759
01:23:19,941 --> 01:23:23,291
Joe, may I have a word with you?

760
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:35,250
I have orders to withdraw to the airport.

761
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:40,949
How long do we have?

762
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:43,479
We leave in 30 minutes.

763
01:23:48,173 --> 01:23:52,840
Joe, you must come. If you do not
come you will die, it's very simple.

764
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:54,940
What about these people?

765
01:23:57,324 --> 01:24:00,695
You must understand,
I've been given no choice.

766
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,182
They could have been alright.

767
01:24:07,183 --> 01:24:10,822
- Come with me, Joe.
- If they knew they’d abandoned, then why would they've come?

768
01:24:10,823 --> 01:24:14,883
- We don't have time for all this.
- And now there's nothing we can do.

769
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:18,867
These children might die
without taking Holy Communion.

770
01:24:19,917 --> 01:24:21,988
We can do something about that.

771
01:25:00,658 --> 01:25:04,256
This is the lime of God.

772
01:25:04,257 --> 01:25:06,970
Happy are those who
are called to his supper.

773
01:25:31,075 --> 01:25:33,946
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

774
01:25:39,144 --> 01:25:41,072
Body of Christ.

775
01:25:46,629 --> 01:25:48,595
Amen.

776
01:25:53,116 --> 01:25:55,046
Body of Christ.

777
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:56,662
Amen.

778
01:26:18,332 --> 01:26:23,254
Burden that we have set down at the
door of the church for this Eucharist.

779
01:26:23,255 --> 01:26:28,940
We know, we must now bear again.

780
01:26:32,345 --> 01:26:41,932
But now strengthened by this
Eucharist and this community.

781
01:26:41,933 --> 01:26:46,536
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

782
01:26:51,035 --> 01:26:52,892
Go in peace.

783
01:27:49,022 --> 01:27:50,015
Joe.

784
01:27:53,948 --> 01:27:55,480
Where are you going?

785
01:27:57,987 --> 01:28:00,490
I'm sorry.

786
01:28:01,456 --> 01:28:03,213
You promised.

787
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,107
I'm sorry.

788
01:28:22,671 --> 01:28:24,157
Capitaine Delon.

789
01:28:25,294 --> 01:28:26,274
Capitaine.

790
01:28:26,275 --> 01:28:28,528
I have a polite request.

791
01:28:28,529 --> 01:28:29,743
It's just from all of us...

792
01:28:29,744 --> 01:28:33,627
...the people of Kuchekiro
and refugees of this school.

793
01:28:35,151 --> 01:28:39,274
We are all fathers,
mothers, sons, daughters.

794
01:28:39,275 --> 01:28:41,758
We are all one family now.

795
01:28:41,759 --> 01:28:46,234
And that is as one family
that we wish to die.

796
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:55,518
Therefore we politely request just before you leave us
that your soldiers use their guns to kill us.

797
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:02,842
We do not wish to be killed by machete.

798
01:29:02,843 --> 01:29:05,750
The bullets will kill us all quickly.

799
01:29:05,751 --> 01:29:07,771
And it will be much less pain.

800
01:29:09,209 --> 01:29:12,017
I'm sorry I can not agree to your request.

801
01:29:12,018 --> 01:29:13,488
Please.

802
01:29:13,489 --> 01:29:15,529
If not for us...

803
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:18,679
Please spare the children the pain.

804
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,587
I am sorry.

805
01:29:27,297 --> 01:29:31,553
Please, just the children.

806
01:29:32,173 --> 01:29:35,562
I can not help you.

807
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:01,028
Christopher.

808
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:02,804
I have to stay.

809
01:30:02,886 --> 01:30:05,768
I can't...

810
01:30:05,769 --> 01:30:07,167
I know.

811
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:09,105
That's how it should be.

812
01:30:09,106 --> 01:30:10,079
Really.

813
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:12,801
Why are you doing this?

814
01:30:13,508 --> 01:30:18,402
You asked me, Joe, where is God in everything
that is happening in here, in all this suffering?

815
01:30:18,403 --> 01:30:20,097
I know exactly where he is.

816
01:30:20,098 --> 01:30:25,148
He is right here with these people, suffering.

817
01:30:26,601 --> 01:30:28,117
His love is here.

818
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:32,274
More intense and profound
than I have ever felt.

819
01:30:32,745 --> 01:30:35,479
And my heart is here, Joe.

820
01:30:36,253 --> 01:30:37,715
My soul.

821
01:30:38,745 --> 01:30:44,351
If I leave I think
I may not find it again.

822
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:05,169
Find fulfillment in everything, Joe.

823
01:32:04,016 --> 01:32:05,693
Don't worry.

824
01:32:42,496 --> 01:32:44,063
Roland.

825
01:32:49,285 --> 01:32:50,098
Good boy.

826
01:32:50,923 --> 01:32:52,048
Squash up.

827
01:32:54,906 --> 01:32:56,477
Squeeze.

828
01:33:03,281 --> 01:33:04,334
Good boy.

829
01:33:04,483 --> 01:33:06,994
You now really squash up.

830
01:33:08,355 --> 01:33:10,029
We got room for one more.

831
01:33:19,641 --> 01:33:25,589
Now, stay under the cover,
don't move and not a squeak!

832
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:30,421
When I come back I want
another load ready to leave.

833
01:34:07,446 --> 01:34:10,552
BEGIN THE WORK!

834
01:35:12,121 --> 01:35:13,576
Julius.

835
01:35:14,645 --> 01:35:16,380
Where are you going?

836
01:35:16,668 --> 01:35:20,937
I have an important meeting
with Bishop Vincent.

837
01:35:20,938 --> 01:35:24,467
Bishop Vincent is not in Kigali.

838
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:26,116
Where are you driving to meet him?

839
01:35:26,555 --> 01:35:29,700
He said he will be in Butare.

840
01:35:34,702 --> 01:35:36,161
Why are you in this truck?

841
01:35:45,647 --> 01:35:48,515
It's the school truck, Julius.

842
01:35:49,681 --> 01:35:51,982
You know where I work.

843
01:35:52,546 --> 01:35:53,763
Julius.

844
01:35:53,764 --> 01:35:55,859
We know each other well.

845
01:35:56,628 --> 01:35:57,596
I don't understand....

846
01:35:57,597 --> 01:35:59,345
You have stolen this vehicle.

847
01:35:59,346 --> 01:36:01,775
No, you're just being an idiot.

848
01:36:01,776 --> 01:36:03,460
This is not a joke.

849
01:36:04,144 --> 01:36:05,915
Alright, I'm sorry.

850
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:08,412
But listen, Julius.

851
01:36:08,413 --> 01:36:09,893
We know each other.

852
01:36:09,894 --> 01:36:13,354
I don't understand why
we are having this conversation.

853
01:36:13,355 --> 01:36:15,565
Put your hands on the truck.

854
01:36:16,269 --> 01:36:21,063
Alright, but why can't we sit down
and talk about this for a while?

855
01:36:22,085 --> 01:36:23,484
Do you want money, Julius?

856
01:36:23,485 --> 01:36:26,458
Put your hands on the truck.

857
01:36:26,611 --> 01:36:27,998
Nienzi lover.

858
01:36:32,939 --> 01:36:35,401
Do as I say.

859
01:36:37,037 --> 01:36:39,012
Look at yourselves.

860
01:36:39,013 --> 01:36:42,390
Just look at yourselves.

861
01:36:42,391 --> 01:36:42,935
Okay.

862
01:36:42,936 --> 01:36:45,500
Enough.

863
01:36:47,169 --> 01:36:50,947
Do you think you are saint
because you are priest?

864
01:36:50,948 --> 01:36:52,129
Do you?

865
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:55,956
Do you know what's so strange,
Julius, even now?

866
01:36:55,957 --> 01:37:08,657
When I'm looking at you, into your eyes,
the only feeling that I have inside me is love.

867
01:38:09,006 --> 01:38:17,919
Is it true that you have a specific guidance not to use the word
'genocide in isolation', but you always took preference to the word 'act'?

868
01:38:18,805 --> 01:38:24,688
I have guidance which I try
to use as best as I can.

869
01:38:24,689 --> 01:38:33,824
I'm not... I have... There are formulations that we are using,
that we are trying to be consistent in our use of...

870
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:43,607
I don't have an absolute categorical prescription against something,
but I have the definitions, I have phraseology, which has been

871
01:38:43,608 --> 01:38:50,974
carefully examined as best as we can
apply to examine the situation and...

872
01:38:50,975 --> 01:38:55,419
How many acts of genocide
does it take to make genocide?

873
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:59,820
That's just not a question
that I'm in position to answer.

874
01:38:59,852 --> 01:39:10,878
Clearly not all of the killings, that have taken place
in Rwanda are killings, to which you may apply that label.

875
01:40:24,657 --> 01:40:28,358
FIVE YEARS LATER.

876
01:41:13,763 --> 01:41:16,361
- Good morning, mister Conor.
- Good morning, sir.

877
01:41:20,211 --> 01:41:23,667
This place is very hard to find.

878
01:41:23,668 --> 01:41:26,279
Yes, I know.

879
01:41:29,754 --> 01:41:33,169
So this is where Father Christopher went to school?

880
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,471
He was a young priest here.

881
01:41:37,513 --> 01:41:40,806
He made a big sacrifice for us.

882
01:41:40,807 --> 01:41:46,562
I remember he would say
"Sacrifice is the most you can love someone".

883
01:41:51,455 --> 01:41:54,312
You know, when I was running
I thought of you in my head.

884
01:41:54,313 --> 01:41:57,556
You remember that day
when you were commentating?

885
01:41:58,789 --> 01:42:06,122
It was so strange, when I was running for my life
I was so frightened, but they were in my head.

886
01:42:06,123 --> 01:42:10,650
Talking and talking,
like you wouldn't shut up.

887
01:42:14,801 --> 01:42:17,044
Why did you leave us?

888
01:42:25,192 --> 01:42:29,726
I was afraid to die.

889
01:42:38,672 --> 01:42:40,786
We are fortunate.

890
01:42:40,787 --> 01:42:44,183
All this time we've been given.

891
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:48,391
We must use it well.

892
01:43:08,722 --> 01:43:22,706
ON APRIL 11th 1994 OVER 2500 RWANDANS, ABANDONED BY THE UN AT THE
ECOLE TECHNIQUE OFFICIELLE, WERE MURDERED BY EXTREMIST MILITIAS

893
01:43:23,931 --> 01:43:31,857
BETWEEN APRIL AND JULY OF THAT YEAR, OVER
800,000 RWANDANS WERE KILLED IN THE GENOCIDE

894
01:43:39,293 --> 01:43:49,393
THIS FILM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE WITHOUT THE
PARTICIPATION AND GENEROSITY OF THE SURVIVORS OF
THE MASSACRE AT THE ECOLE TECHNIQUE OFFICIELLE

895
01:43:50,453 --> 01:44:00,793
THE FILM IS DEDICATED TO THEM,
AND TO ALL WHO LOST THEIR LIVES
IN THE GENOCIDE

896
01:44:01,305 --> 01:44:07,171
