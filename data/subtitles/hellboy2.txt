My son, will you turn off
that wretched puppet?

5
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:33,127
Brush your teeth.

6
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:35,864
Don't call him a puppet.

7
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,397
l beg your pardon.

8
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:40,100
Look, he's not a puppet.

9
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:41,401
Howdy Doody's real.

Well...
He's real.

Oh, no.

13
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,676
And remember,

00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:52,246

down the chimney.

15

He has his ways.

Then l want to wait up.
Watch him do it.

18
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,019
Nonsense.

19
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,856
Okay.
l want a story then.

00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:04,292
Oh, no, no, no.
No stories tonight.

115
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,940
Not at all.

116
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,409
Forgotten by you,
perhaps,

117
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,913

Security. Call security!

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,332
What do you think
you're doing?

124
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,668
This is outrageous.

125

Take what you want.
Please leave.

126

Be quiet.

128
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,855
Sit down!

129
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,460
Proud, empty, hollow
things that you are.

130
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:37,265
Let this remind you
why you once
feared the dark.

131
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:27,081
físhstíck. We have to talk.

132
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,116
MANNING: Undercover.

133
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:32,618
Can't he get the
meaning of the word?

134
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,386
Look, we are still
government-funded.

135
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:38,092
We are still a secret,
although a dirty secret,
if you ask me.

136
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:41,663
Officially we do
not exist, you see.

137
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:44,664
So that's the problem
when we get these.

138
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,105
Subway. Highway. Park.

139
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,508
And he posed for this one
and gave an autograph.

140
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:57,979
l suppress each photo.
Cell phone videos.

141
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,716
They cost me
a fortune and they
show up on YouTube.

142
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,450
God, l hate YouTube.

143
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:06,721
Well, he just
wants the world outside
to know what we do,

144
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,554
what he does.

145
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,423
He loathes me.

146
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,524
l don't think so.

147
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:12,859
No?

148
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:14,027
Target practice.

149
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:15,195
Oh, dear.

150
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,596
And then he
posts them around.

151
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,168
Do you know how
that makes me feel?

152
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:29,842
What's going on?

153
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:31,211
Oh, it's Friday.

154
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:33,113
l tell you, Fishstick,
he hates me.

155
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,379
He's out to destroy me.

156
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,383
My street cred is low.

157
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:37,582
Street cred?

158
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:38,716
My mojo.

159
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:41,721
Washington,
they're wondering
if l've got the stuff.

160
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,054
You think l have
an easy job?

161
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,067
Do you think
l enjoy being
a pain in the neck?

162
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:53,265
l am medicated.

163
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,068
l mean,
this is not candy.

164
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:57,636
This is...
It's an antacid.

165
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:59,538
Yes, it's an
over-the-counter
medicine,

166
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:02,241
but this is medicine.

167
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:05,880
You see, l worry
because, you know,

168
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,984
l mean, l am,
we are, after all

169
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,153
we're iust humble
public servants.

170
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:15,389
lt's not about you.
He's acting out.

171
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,691
Things are a little
tense with Liz.

172
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:21,028
Tense? How tense?
Tense how?

173
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:23,596
Well, you know, the usual.

174
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,999
A new couple
making adjustments.

175
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,967
They argue.
They argue, huh?

176
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,201
Sometimes.
How bad?

177
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,536
Like everybody else.

178
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:33,606
They have good days
and bad days.

179
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:37,509
LIZ: l'm not done with you.

180
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:02,400
Hey, Abe.

181
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,836
LIZ: Red, come back here!

182
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,038
Manning.

183
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,339
LIZ: Pick up your clothes!

184
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:07,606
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

185
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:09,142
LIZ: Put away your things!

186
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:12,278
HELLBOY: Watch it,
boys, she's on fire.

187
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,249
Then again, there are
the really bad days.

188
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:18,450
l'm not afraid
of you, you know.

189
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,989
LIZ: You should be.
Look at this mess.
Look around.

190
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:23,991
l have one rule.
Don't touch my stuff.

191
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,427
LIZ: Oh, l get it.
That's your rule. Okay.

192
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,827
The one and only.
l'm easy.

193
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:29,995
How's that even possible?

194
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,096
Everything is your stuff.

195
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,899
The same CD, LP.

196
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,200
lt's Al Green.

197
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:35,433
You can't listen
to Al Green on CD.

198
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,668
But it's good to keep.

199
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:38,238
And an eight-track.
An eight-track, Red?

200
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:40,975
Yeah, well, one day,
the world's gonna
realize its mistake.

201
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,674
Eight-track was
the way to go, baby.

202
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,278
Come on, kids,
you can come out now.

203
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,981
That's right,
it's all over.
That's right.

204
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,682
And what about me, Red?

205
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:52,318
l need some space.

206
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:56,990
At least enough to
find my toothbrush.

207
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:59,359
Toothbrush? Wait a minute.

208
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,495
lt's right there.

209
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:09,102
Red! l can't
live like this.

210
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:11,870
MAN ON PA: Securíty breach
central Manhattan.

211
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,139
Oh, damn.

212
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,975
Gotta go.
We all gotta go.

213
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,009
lt's an emergency, right?

214
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,278
MAN ON PA:
Securíty breach.
Let's go.

215
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:19,878
MANNING: Red. Red!

216
00:16:19,943 --> 00:16:21,413
MAN ON PA: All personnel
to garage area.

217
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,914
Hold on a sec.

218
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,952
Oh, ieez, it's Manning.
Watch yourself, Liz.

219
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,419
Red. Red!

220
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,022
Listen.

221
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:30,155
Manning.
Hi.

222
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:31,423
We're going to
downtown Manhattan.

223
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,658
Yeah, it'll be fun.

224
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:34,159
Downtown.
Very dangerous.

225
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,628
Dangerous for you.

226
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:37,864
And for me.

227
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:40,134
Now, l know
you dream of
the outside world,

228
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:41,634
but, trust me,
it's not that great.

229
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,340
lt's savage, as a
matter of fact. Bad.

230
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:47,307
LIZ: Come on, fellas,
Iet's get this out of here.

231
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:49,609
These, on the
other hand, are good.

232
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:51,309
Mmm.

233
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,945
Cuban.

234
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,514
Good.

235
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:55,713
Being seen?

236
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:56,847
Bad.

237
00:16:56,913 --> 00:17:00,755
Exactly.
l confiscated a box of these,
and l'll get you some more.

238
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:04,358
But you've gotta do me
a little favor tonight,
out there.

239
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:07,929
You have to be...
You have to be very, very...

240
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:08,992
Discreet.

241
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,563
What? Thank you. Yes.
You're welcome.

242
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:11,896
Discreet.

243
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:15,036
lnvisible. In and out.

244
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,238
Really?
Hey.

245
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,973
Hey, l can be
discreet if l wanna be.

246
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,541
l followed you
and Myers, didn't l?

247
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,676
And then you had him
transferred to Antarctica.

248
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:26,413
That's very discreet.

249
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,248
He said he liked the cold.

250
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:31,750
Like a shadow.

251
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,288
AGENT OVER PA:
Red team, Red team.

252
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,228
Like a shadow
in the night.

253
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:55,309
MANNING: US Customs
discovered a few
illegally imported items.

254
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:58,880
lt's a minor infraction.
And a gas pocket.

255
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,882
They detected
a gas pocket up there.

256
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:05,252
Now FBl agents,
under my command,

257
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:09,825
are going up there right now
with special gas equipment.

258
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,727
Jeez, it stinks in here.

259
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:17,395
This is worse
than my room.

260
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:20,201
AGENT:
Waiting for
a report on that.

261
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:23,469
Say ''cheese. ''

262
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,105
Let's go.

263
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:56,635
Whatever they
called us for is over.

264
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:59,338
We had over 70
guests reported.

265
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:02,008
We have no survivors,
no bodies.

266
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:03,509
Same story here, babe.

267
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,076
LIZ: Don't call me ''babe. ''

268
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:08,115
''Abe, '' l said.
''Abe. '' Wrong channel.

269
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:14,454
Abe, l think Liz is
still mad at me.

270
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,988
LIZ: Stíll the same channel.

271
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,055
Oh!

272
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:34,707
HELLBOY: Can l ask
you a questíon?

273
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:36,040
No.

274
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:37,943
Now, listen.
When we get home later,

275
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,778
l'm gonna clean up
my whole mess.

276
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:41,078
That's not the problem.

277
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:42,180
What is it?

278
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,281
Not now.

279
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:54,027
Abe, what have you got?

280
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,262
Oh, this is interesting.

281
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,898
Both boxes have
the Royal Seal.

282
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:01,734
Only delivered
at a time of war.

283
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:40,807
Red? We have company.

284
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,413
HELLBOY: Come on, Blue,
gíve me somethíng
to work wíth here.

285
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:46,945
Burrowing creatures.

286
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,447
How many of them?
ABE: Many.

287
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:52,519
There are no corpses
because there
are no leftovers.

288
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,487
Have you notíced the floor?

289
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:55,587
Oh, crap.

290
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:56,654
ABE: Precísely.

291
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:58,723
All these things
do is eat and eat.

292
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:00,759
Then poop,
and then eat again.

293
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:02,662
Remind you of anyone?

294
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,298
Damn it, Abe.
What are these things?

295
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:09,368
HELLBOY: Englísh, Englísh.

296
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:10,469
Oh, they're Tooth Fairies.

297
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,702
Ha!

298
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,839
No, no. Third century,
Black Forest.

299
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:17,679
Feed mostly on calcium,
bones, skin, organs.

300
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:21,516
But they do go
for the teeth first.

301
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,616
Hence the name
Tooth Fairies.

302
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,554
LIZ: l bet you they don't
Ieave money, either.

303
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:39,531
Oh, my God.

304
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:43,537
Liz, you're pregnant.

305
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:44,903
No, l'm not.

306
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:46,372
Yes, you are.

307
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:00,619
What have you got, Marble?

308
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,555
Think l may have found one.

309
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,157
But he's kind of cute.

310
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,328
HELLBOY: Don't go near it!

311
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:20,405
lt's biting me!

312
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:24,009
Marble.

313
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:25,912
It hurts! It hurts!

314
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,733
LIZ: Red, we need you here!

315
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:51,970
Marble.

316
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,407
Nasty little...

317
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,590
Keep firing, Abe.
Keep firing!

318
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:26,638
Damn.

319
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:49,528
Sorry, lady.

320
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,604
You should be running.

321
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,638
There's a safe upstairs.

322
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:01,105
How do we get there?

323
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:02,642
We need a clearing.

324
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,809
Run!

325
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:13,384
Up to the safe, now!

326
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:18,423
LIZ: Abe. Up the stairs.

327
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:25,532
Come on, Liz,
burn them all.
Go. Go!

328
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,634
Yes, we're going!

329
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:30,903
STEEL: Get in the safe, Abe.
Get in the safe!

330
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:41,980
Oh, no, no.

331
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,417
No, no, no!

332
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:46,652
Steel!

333
00:24:58,461 --> 00:24:59,865
Damned beasts.

334
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:08,375
Fire is mine.

335
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:11,510
Fire is in me.

336
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:14,279
Red, stay away
from the window!

337
00:25:15,445 --> 00:25:17,951
Fire is me.

338
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,452
Stop biting me!

339
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:27,561
Fire is me.

340
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:31,131
World, here l come.

341
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:19,577
What have you done?

342
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,680
Guess we're out.

343
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,849
REPORTER: Hey, Hellboy,
over here.

344
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,986
CHAMBERLAIN:
Your Royal Highness.

345
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,935
Before entering
the council chamber,

346
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,508
you must surrender
your weapon.

347
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,040
l will not.

348
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:31,221
lt is protocol,
sire, for peasant
and prince alike.

349
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,200
For you, Sister,

350
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:51,502
anything.

351
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:58,846
Accordíng to multíple eye
wítnesses, líves were,
ín fact, endangered.

352
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,444
There you have ít, Hellboy.

353
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,248
But ís he really
on our síde?

354
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,615
Do you have superpowers?

355
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,916
Well, yeah.

356
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,686
But, really, all
l wanna be ís just
an ordínary person,

357
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,953
íust líke you and
you and everybody.

358
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:13,058
Hey, guys.
You're missing this.

359
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:15,527
We're on TV.

360
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:19,631
ABE: Liz. Liz,
are you all right?

361
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:21,599
Yeah, l'll be out
in a minute.

362
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,269
You don't need to do that.
You can trust me.

363
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,569
My readings are
quite accurate.

364
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:26,804
Shut up, Abe.

365
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,508
Get your damn hand
away from the door.

366
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:32,577
You have nothing to fear.

367
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:33,945
ln spite of appearances,

368
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,884
l believe Red
would be an excellent
father figure.

369
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,453
And what about thís guy?

370
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:43,221
Walkíng around
wíth a toílet
seat on hís head.

371
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:44,521
A toilet seat!

372
00:28:44,587 --> 00:28:47,961
lt's quite obvious it's
a breathing apparatus.

373
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:50,262
Hey, l think we gotta
Iose the garbage truck.

374
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:52,365
Sends out the wrong signal.

375
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:55,800
You think that's
our problem?

376
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:57,402
Transportation?

377
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,942
And thís gírl, we
defínítely have to fínd out
what's wrong wíth her.

378
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,076
She's cute, though.
We should get
her on the show.

379
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,980
l hate it when
people stare at me.

380
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:09,715
Makes me feel
like a freak.

381
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,951
You had no right, Red.

382
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,117
lt's Manning. Could you...

383
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:14,219
How many tímes do
l have to tell you?

384
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,057
lt's a gas pocket.

385
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:19,592
And a gaseous
phenomenon that occurred...

386
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:25,932
Gas pocket.
What an idiot.

387
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:29,835
You've murdered me.

388
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,137
You have murdered me.

389
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:36,909
You have ridiculed me.

390
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,515
And you have brought
this unto yourself.

391
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:43,847
What?

392
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:47,855
Washington is sending
down a new BPRD agent.

393
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,387
A new guy?

394
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,655
Why?

395
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:53,125
To look after you.

396
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,402
Sire, please.

397
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:26,492
To set us free.
All of us, Father.

398
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,165
A truce based on shame.

399
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:38,137
The humans have
forgotten the gods,

400
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:40,638
destroyed the Earth.
And for what?

401
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:45,577
Parking lots.
Shopping malls.

402
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:47,980
Greed has burned
a hole in their heart
that will never be filled.

403
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,182
They will never
have enough.

404
00:30:57,721 --> 00:30:58,721
Honor?

405
00:30:59,823 --> 00:31:02,994
Look at this place.
Where is the honor in it?

406
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,465
Father, you were
once a proud warrior.

407
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,834
When did you
become their pet?

408
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,707
l have returned
from exile to wage war

409
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:17,476
and reclaim our land,
our birthright.

410
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:21,647
And for that, l will
call upon the help
of all of my people.

411
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:23,848
And they will answer,

412
00:31:23,913 --> 00:31:27,153
the good, the bad

413
00:31:29,185 --> 00:31:30,556
and the worst.

414
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:38,030
Perhaps l am.
Perhaps they made me so.

415
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:53,479
We will not fade.

416
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:00,585
lt is.

417
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:02,354
l am sorry, Father.

418
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:20,075
And you, Sister,
are you at peace with
your king's verdict?

419
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:22,709
l am, my brother. l am.

420
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,579
Then very well.
Death it is.

421
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,630
Now, for the final piece,
my sister.

422
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:30,969
Where is she, Wink?
Where is she?

423
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:42,047
NUADA:
Go find her.
Now! Find her!

424
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:49,755
AUTOMATED VOlCE: Elevator
arrívíng now to sectíon 42.

425
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,795
Elevator arrívíng
now to sectíon 42.

426
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:58,429
Pardon me, boys.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

427
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,164
ls he here?
Not yet.

428
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,398
l'm telling you,
we don't need this guy.

429
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:02,567
Well, l think we do.

430
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:05,269
Evidently, this
guy's quite the big
shot in Washington.

431
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:07,440
What's his name?

432
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,541
His name is Johann Krauss.

433
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:12,210
Johann Krauss?
Sounds German.

434
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:13,844
He's the top man in...

435
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:14,945
Ectoplasmic.

436
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,282
Yes, thank you.
Ectoplasmic research.

437
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:19,851
Comes highly recommended
by our European liaison.

438
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,286
Johann Krauss.
''Liaison. ''

439
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:22,954
l love that word,
don't you?

440
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:24,556
lt's so hoity toity.

441
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:26,090
l don't like Germans.
No fingerprints.

442
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:27,858
Here he comes.
Germans make me nervous.

443
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:33,135
No photo. Dossier says,
and l translate,
''He has a nice open face. ''

444
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:49,079
Oh, my God.

445
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,318
Damen und Herren,
Johann Krauss
at your service.

446
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:56,320
l like him.

447
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,295
Look at that.
Poor little thing.

448
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:05,030
Bought and sold on
the black market.

449
00:36:05,094 --> 00:36:06,697
Crammed into
cargo containers.

450
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:09,135
Smuggled, abused.

451
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,735
He has very
expressive hands.

452
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,871
The seal on the box
worries me also.

453
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:14,103
A warring emblem.

454
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,306
Yes, from the Bethmoora clan.

455
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:16,407
The Sons of the Earth.

456
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,643
Your file says
you're the brains
of the operation,

457
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,210
and l must admit,
l'm impressed.

458
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:22,079
ln my file, you'll see,
Mr. Krauss,

459
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,117
that l worked
very closely with Abe
in his training.

460
00:36:25,181 --> 00:36:26,284
Ja, o_ay.

461
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:28,286
Let's see what our little
friend here can remember.

462
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:31,490
Memory gets a little
sketchy right after
you've burned to death.

463
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:35,862
But maybe Saint
Malachy can help.

464
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:38,163
Oh, no, no.
No amulets,
Meín Herr.

465
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:39,431
Teleplasty.

466
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:41,032
Plastic. Very modern.

467
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:44,469
Teleplasty by which
an ectoplasmic medium,

468
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:48,541
such as Dr. Krauss,
can control inanimate things,

469
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:53,181
organic, mechanical,
dead or alive.

470
00:36:53,242 --> 00:36:56,148
JOHANN: Take it, take it
all in, meín Junge.

471
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:01,655
There we are. Get up.

472
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,121
Get up. Get up.

473
00:37:05,288 --> 00:37:08,226
Now l have full control
of its limbic system.

474
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:10,327
Let us see how long
l can hold it.

475
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:12,996
What?

476
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:15,367
Hey, you chewed off
the tip of my tail.

477
00:37:15,998 --> 00:37:17,367
Yeah, you, you little...

478
00:37:17,432 --> 00:37:20,873
lt says you're rude, brutish
und not very bright.

479
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:22,005
Wow!

480
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,579
lt seems our
little friend here

481
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,483
remembers market
sounds and voices.

482
00:37:30,547 --> 00:37:33,018
And a peculiar
troll language spoken

483
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,619
in the last place
his cage was opened.

484
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,588
The troll market.

485
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:38,490
The troll market?
Come on.

486
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:40,891
No one's ever found it.

487
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:43,027
That's because
it doesn't exist.

488
00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:49,802
Mr. Krauss? Dr. Krauss, sir.

489
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:53,005
Our little informant there
doesn't look so good.

490
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:11,322
Back inside, you.
There we are.

491
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:13,858
So, now we know
where to begin.

492
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:15,927
Trolls dwell under bridges.

493
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:17,963
Wow. You're a genius.

494
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:21,434
By the way, there's
over 2, OOO bridges
in New York City.

495
00:38:21,496 --> 00:38:24,637
But Vladimir Vanya,
19th century
occult historian,

496
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,204
places the troll
market directly under

497
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:27,704
the east end of
the Brooklyn Bridge.

498
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:28,806
We've already looked there.

499
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:30,675
Yes, you have,
but not with me, Agent.

500
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,275
Not with me.

501
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:33,945
We're moving in.

502
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,599
Keep it coming,
keep it coming.
Hold it.

503
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,905
''Not with me, Agent. ''
What an ego.

504
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,105
l like him.

505
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,074
Well, you can keep him.

506
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:07,778
l mean, am l the only
one that thinks this
guy is full of...

507
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:09,112
No, no, no, no,
don't lean.

508
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:12,952
Lot 336, the Schufftein
glasses. Could it be?

509
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:14,686
The three surviving
pairs,

510
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:16,353
and we will use them to
Iocate the troll market.

511
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:18,289
Dr. Krauss, what a coup.

512
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:20,092
The Schufftein glasses.

513
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,159
You're my hero.

514
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:23,360
Hey. You Hellboy?

515
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:24,494
Yeah.

516
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:26,197
You're ugly, man.

517
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:29,902
Two more on
the wall in front of me

518
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:32,603
and then three on
the alleys facing that way.

519
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:34,938
What do you think of
Mr. Know-lt-All?

520
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,106
Don't know,
too early to tell.

521
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:37,407
Hey, you're Hellboy.

522
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,643
l know, l'm ugly.

523
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,110
Forget it.

524
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:41,980
We'll talk about it later.

525
00:39:42,612 --> 00:39:47,221
He's sure of himself,
and l think maybe
you're intimidated.

526
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,222
lntimidated. Huh?

527
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:58,864
JOHANN: Keep us up to
date on the cameras,
Agent Sherman. Over and out.

528
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,331
What's this?

529
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,635
Normally, we can't see
fairy folk and trolls.

530
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:09,242
They generate a cloaking
aura called ''glamour. ''

531
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,612
But in 1878,
Emil Schufftein designed
and built these.

532
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:15,579
four crystal díopters
that penetrate that effect

533
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:18,117
and reveal the true
nature of thíngs.

534
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:21,219
Oh, Dr. Krauss, they're more
beautiful than l'd imagined.

535
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:22,686
You must try
them on then.
Oh, yes.

536
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,621
Try them on, Agent.
They'll look good.

537
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,523
l love these tight
little leather straps.

538
00:40:26,588 --> 00:40:27,992
lntimidated?

539
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:31,929
Mr. Kraut? Sir?

540
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:34,099
Krauss, Agent.
With a double ''S. ''

541
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:36,201
S-S. Right, right.

542
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:38,469
Listen, those gizmos?

543
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:44,909
How do you know they work?

544
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:46,043
LIZ: l have a suspect.

545
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:48,847
Give me a vector,
Agent Sherman. A vector.

546
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,516
B-1 2, the alley, northbound.

547
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,851
JOHANN :
Well, track the target.
We' re comíng down.

548
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:56,153
Keep an eye on her.
l'll be right back.

549
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:57,989
This little old lady?
Come on.

550
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:00,994
lt's a Fragglewump,
an ugly Scottish troll.

551
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:02,693
They're afraid of canaries.

552
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,764
Oh, my God. Canaries, huh?

553
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:07,831
What about the kittens?

554
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:08,932
She feeds on them.

555
00:41:08,998 --> 00:41:11,369
WOMAN: Come on, then.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

556
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,103
That thing is a ''she''?

557
00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:35,659
Down, you fools.

558
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,027
What do you think
you are doing?

559
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:38,362
She's gonna eat the cat.

560
00:41:38,427 --> 00:41:41,333
You'll make her
aware of our presence.

561
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,565
ABE: We should use
the canary now.

562
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:43,768
She's gonna eat it!

563
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,068
ABE: We should use
the bird, Dr. Krauss.

564
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,302
The bird.

565
00:41:48,737 --> 00:41:49,873
She's going to eat the cat.

566
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,041
You will stay put
and follow my orders.

567
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:52,175
l can't sit by here...

568
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:54,278
You are directly
under my command,
and you have to obey.

569
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:55,914
Stay put!
Oh, screw this!

570
00:41:55,978 --> 00:41:57,313
Hey! Lucy.

571
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,648
Come back here.

572
00:41:58,713 --> 00:42:00,418
l'm home.

573
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:02,920
Oh, yes, dearie.
Can l help you?

574
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:05,222
Give it up, nasty.
We can see you.

575
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:06,657
You see me?

576
00:42:06,722 --> 00:42:09,260
How? How do you see me?

577
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:11,829
We're looking
for the entrance

578
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:13,364
to the troll market.
Any clues?

579
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:15,666
Come any closer and
l'll rip your heart.

580
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:17,501
We're gonna have to get
a little old-school, Abe.

581
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:19,304
Give me the bird.

582
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,539
Not a canary.

583
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:25,376
What, you're afraid
of this little guy?

584
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,744
Who'd know?

585
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,045
No more, no more.

586
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,612
l'll take you there.

587
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:35,420
Come on, let's go,
you dirty old troll.

588
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:53,871
Let's go.

589
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,675
Agent Sherman,
we are going into
the troll market.

590
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:58,108
Keep communication
to a minimum.

591
00:42:58,173 --> 00:42:59,510
Over und out.

592
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:01,378
l like him.

593
00:43:01,443 --> 00:43:03,047
You see, this is
a man who takes charge.

594
00:43:03,112 --> 00:43:04,148
You think?

595
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:05,349
Yeah. He's efficient.

596
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:07,251
He's precise.

597
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:09,753
You add ''resistant'' to that,
you got yourself a new watch.

598
00:43:09,818 --> 00:43:13,559
Dr. Krauss is aware
of the chain of
command, and he...

599
00:43:13,623 --> 00:43:14,757
Oh, brother!

600
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:16,327
He seems to like me.

601
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:22,599
OLD WOMAN: Here we are.

602
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,036
Wow, that's some door!

603
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:32,177
JOHANN: It's a complex
combination lock.

604
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:34,378
What do you think,
Agent Sapien?

605
00:43:35,478 --> 00:43:36,579
Not good.

606
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:39,751
With the number of symbols
on the combination,
we'll be here for days.

607
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:40,952
Well, not necessarily.

608
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,719
Let me try my technique.

609
00:43:42,784 --> 00:43:44,121
Open it, Lucy.

610
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:45,722
l will not.

611
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:47,023
Pretty please.

612
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,295
Do as you may, demon.

613
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,097
Release the yellow beast.

614
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:53,329
Tear my eyes out.

615
00:43:53,396 --> 00:43:56,335
Rip my insides and
my legs and my tongue,

616
00:43:56,398 --> 00:43:58,735
but l will never
open that door.

617
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,114
ls that your
investigative technique?

618
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,380
lt said ''never. ''

619
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:11,949
lt's unconscionable.

620
00:44:12,715 --> 00:44:14,085
That means
he didn't like it.

621
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,485
What?

622
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,489
So, what, you're
gonna show us
how it's done,

623
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,590
Mr. By-The-Book?

624
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:21,257
ls that it?

625
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:23,760
Yes, l think l will.

626
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:29,800
There we are.

627
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,938
Let me see. Yes.

628
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,996
Gentlemen, welcome
to the troll market.

629
00:45:35,431 --> 00:45:39,306
LIZ: Red, there's
somethíng really ímportant
that l need to tell you.

630
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,972
Oh, Liz, you should
be here. You'd love it.

631
00:45:42,038 --> 00:45:44,443
Nobody's looking at us.
We blend right in.

632
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:47,211
Agent, l said keep
communication to a minimum.

633
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,911
You'll blow our cover.

634
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:50,815
You know?
l think he's right.

635
00:45:52,414 --> 00:45:54,518
l'm bringing you
here for sure, babe.

636
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,253
The físhbowl wants
radío sílence. So...

637
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:57,954
Over and out.

638
00:46:20,943 --> 00:46:22,478
The Royal Seal.

639
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:39,264
Brother Red.
Red, do you read me?

640
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,300
Yeah, l read you, Blue,
but l'm watching
Sherlock at work.

641
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:43,500
l'll get back to you.

642
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:44,634
JOHANN: Excuse me, sir.

643
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:48,442
Sir, excuse... Pardon me.
Sir, may l ask a...

644
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:54,978
CREATURE: l gotta tell
the boys that one.

645
00:46:55,043 --> 00:46:56,079
Excuse me, gentlemen.

646
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,083
Have you seen anyone
purchasing this
type of Tooth Fairy?

647
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:00,751
No one sells them
down here, pal.

648
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,353
Over in Jersey, maybe.

649
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:04,422
Well, what about this, then?

650
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:06,556
Do you recognize this seal?

651
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,092
Make him go away.
Make him go away.

652
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:09,559
No. We don't.

653
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,793
Please, dear sir.

654
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,398
You'd better go. Now!

655
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:14,664
We'll make it
worth your while.

656
00:47:15,931 --> 00:47:18,570
Don't waste your time.
We will not talk!

657
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:20,068
What are you doing?

658
00:47:20,135 --> 00:47:21,873
You're absolutely
sure about that, huh?

659
00:47:21,936 --> 00:47:23,307
Absolutely.

660
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:24,474
You won't talk, eh?

661
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:25,576
Never.

662
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:26,809
Never, huh?

663
00:47:26,876 --> 00:47:29,313
Never ever, ever.

664
00:47:54,403 --> 00:47:55,572
Feeling a little
chattier now?

665
00:47:55,637 --> 00:47:57,007
We'll never talk.

666
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:58,675
Yes, yes.

667
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,278
We will, only don't
hit me anymore.

668
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:02,846
Chicken.

669
00:48:02,911 --> 00:48:04,547
Who bought
the Tooth Fairies?

670
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:06,215
Prince Nuada.

671
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:08,353
They say Prince Nuada
broke the truce,

672
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,086
and now there is
talk of war

673
00:48:10,152 --> 00:48:12,289
a war with
the human world.

674
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:14,925
Sorry, kid.

675
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:16,360
That's all right.

676
00:48:16,592 --> 00:48:17,961
Nice baby.

677
00:48:18,027 --> 00:48:20,498
l'm not a baby.
l'm a tumor.

678
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:27,806
Yes, Red. l am
following a lead
right now.

679
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:29,539
lt may turn out...

680
00:48:32,007 --> 00:48:34,278
lt may turn out
to be nothing,

681
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,715
but l will let you
know soon enough.

682
00:49:05,675 --> 00:49:08,414
What do you want?
Tell me your name.

683
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:16,753
Follow me.

684
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:21,259
Your father
Ieft you this map.

685
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:24,362
ln it, he said,
lies the secret

686
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,030
to the location
of the Golden Army.

687
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:30,802
Move away!
Quickly, Your Highness.

688
00:49:34,135 --> 00:49:36,005
Can l help you
with something?

689
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,909
No, thank you.
l'm just looking.

690
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,744
You can't go in there!

691
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:41,277
NUALA: Sir, why
are you following me?

692
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:42,846
l...

693
00:49:43,012 --> 00:49:46,818
l was just hoping
to find an old map
chart of Algiers.

694
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:48,485
Why are you following me?

695
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,186
l was not.

696
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:53,056
Did my brother send you
to steal the crown piece?

697
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:54,391
Your brother?

698
00:49:54,456 --> 00:49:57,260
Oh, you're sorely
mistaken, l assure you.

699
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,228
Then answer me truthfully.

700
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,032
Why were you following me?

701
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:06,271
My name is Abraham Sapien.

702
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:09,137
There is no such name.

703
00:50:09,204 --> 00:50:10,507
Oh, l don't like
it either, but l...

704
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:11,807
Enough.

705
00:50:11,873 --> 00:50:14,143
Give me your hand.

706
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:15,545
Your hand.

707
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:24,722
You are an agent

708
00:50:24,786 --> 00:50:28,092
for the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense.

709
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:30,960
And your name is...

710
00:50:32,327 --> 00:50:33,329
Oh...

711
00:50:33,728 --> 00:50:35,364
Horrible, l know.

712
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:38,068
l'm Nuala,
Princess Nuala.

713
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:40,103
Yes, l know.

714
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:42,005
Forgive me,
Your Highness,

715
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,074
but as you were
Iearning about me,

716
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:47,311
l couldn't help
but learn a bit
about you myself.

717
00:50:48,811 --> 00:50:50,514
l know that you
need our help.

718
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,650
l'm afraid it's
the other way around.

719
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:04,027
The window. Out now.

720
00:51:04,092 --> 00:51:05,463
l will take care of this.

721
00:51:05,527 --> 00:51:06,795
Oh, dear.

722
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:28,885
Go! Now go!

723
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:50,206
Get out of here, Blue.

724
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:52,141
Yes. Come with me,
Your Highness.

725
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:53,208
You.

726
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:58,182
Let me put this to you
as delicately as l can.

727
00:52:05,153 --> 00:52:07,123
My cigar, it was Cuban.

728
00:52:07,822 --> 00:52:09,726
Now you pissed me off.

729
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:20,269
Oh, crap.

730
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:29,612
Whoa!

731
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,085
Now stay down!

732
00:54:00,268 --> 00:54:01,403
Damn.

733
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,911
A tooth. Happy?

734
00:54:12,947 --> 00:54:15,052
Give it up, pal.
It's over.

735
00:54:16,617 --> 00:54:18,822
l wouldn't do that
if l were you.

736
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:34,070
Wow. Told you.

737
00:54:43,378 --> 00:54:46,418
,
JOHANN: Oh, meín Gott
what have you done,
Agent Hellboy?

738
00:54:46,481 --> 00:54:48,351
Look at this!
Now we have to leave.

739
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:50,989
Red. This is Princess Nuala.

740
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:53,188
Lady.

741
00:54:53,255 --> 00:54:54,523
JOHANN: We should leave.
Now. Now!

742
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:55,893
Let's go.

743
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:36,434
To wage his war,
my brother needs this,

744
00:55:36,498 --> 00:55:38,768
the final piece of
the Crown of Bethmoora

745
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,306
and this map to the location
of the Golden Army chamber.

746
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:43,474
The Golden Army.

747
00:55:43,538 --> 00:55:45,175
The harbingers of death.

748
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,844
The unstoppable tide.

749
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:48,710
Howdy Doody.

750
00:55:48,777 --> 00:55:51,516
Your Highness, if you hand
the crown piece over to us...

751
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:53,784
No. Where it goes, l go.

752
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,188
My father died to uphold
the truce with your world.

753
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:58,956
You must honor
his noble intention.

754
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:00,322
The lady's
in dire danger.

755
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:03,027
l take it you're
vouching for her,
Agent Sapien?

756
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:05,596
Most emphatically.
Yes, l am.

757
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:06,896
Even so.

758
00:56:07,561 --> 00:56:10,501
l am sorry, but we
simply cannot assume

759
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:12,568
such responsibility
On OU l OWn.

760
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:14,003
The lady iust
Iost her father.

761
00:56:14,068 --> 00:56:15,405
What more do you want?

762
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:18,710
You may not care,
but there are
procedures, rules

763
00:56:18,773 --> 00:56:20,277
and little handbooks...

764
00:56:20,342 --> 00:56:21,777
She's coming with us.

765
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:22,945
You got that, Gas Bag?

766
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,079
What did you call me?

767
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:25,547
NUADA: You.

768
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:30,554
You will pay
for what happened
to my friend down there.

769
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:32,856
Yeah, right.
You take checks?

770
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,190
Demon.

771
00:56:34,255 --> 00:56:35,557
Born from a womb of shadows.

772
00:56:35,623 --> 00:56:38,463
Sent to destroy their
world, and you still
believe you belong.

773
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:39,996
Are we gonna
talk all night?

774
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:41,764
'Cause l'm really sleepy.

775
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,802
No, Brother, no!

776
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:00,382
Kill him.

777
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,963
lt's just a jumping bean.

778
00:57:13,027 --> 00:57:14,864
lt's going for water. Hurry.

779
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:19,601
Oh, dear.

780
00:57:20,835 --> 00:57:23,307
No. No, no, no, no. No.

781
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:54,503
MAN 1: What the hell is that?
AGENT: Excuse me!

782
00:57:56,237 --> 00:57:58,641
MAN 2: Stay back.
MAN 3: Hey, what's going on?

783
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:27,771
PILOT: We've got
target ín síght.

784
00:58:29,103 --> 00:58:31,108
lt's an Elemental,

785
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:33,309
a giver of life
and a destroyer.

786
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:34,443
What?

787
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,744
A Forest God.

788
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:38,981
HELLBOY: A Forest God, eh?

789
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,119

790
00:58:50,992 --> 00:58:54,599
Somebody help!
My baby's...
Help! Help!

00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:56,264
How can l help you, ma'am?

792
00:58:56,331 --> 00:58:58,101
My baby's inside!

793
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:00,036
Come with us,
dear lady, please.

794
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:01,570
There's nothing
to worry about.

795
00:59:01,635 --> 00:59:03,072
We've got everything
under control.

796
00:59:03,137 --> 00:59:06,244
WOMAN: Please. My baby's
still in there! Please!

797
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,125
Hey, little guy.

PILOT: Homíng ín on target.

799
00:59:42,777 --> 00:59:44,280
Hang on, kid.

800
00:59:54,889 --> 00:59:55,958
JOHANN: Agent Hellboy.

801
00:59:56,023 --> 00:59:58,262
Reach higher ground
and shoot the weapon.

802
00:59:58,559 --> 00:59:59,795
Shoot the weapon!

803
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,115
First praise the tail, kid.

804
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:36,766
You must shoot it in
the energy ganglion.

805
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:37,867
The what?

806
01:00:37,932 --> 01:00:38,934
JOHANN: The energy ganglion.

807
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,871
Scheísse. The head!
Shoot it in the head!

808
01:00:42,603 --> 01:00:43,605
Whoa!

809
01:00:53,681 --> 01:00:55,016
Oh, crap.

810
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:02,360
You gotta trust me,
little buddy. Okay?

811
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:15,172
You woke up the baby.

812
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,469
Agent Hellboy,
take the shot!

813
01:01:44,532 --> 01:01:46,469
Right now! Take it!

01:01:46,534 --> 01:01:48,505
That's an order!
Take the shot.

815
01:01:48,637 --> 01:01:50,639
That's an order,
Agent Hellboy.

816
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:55,315
Shoot it!
Shoot the gun!
Shoot the gun!

817
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,416
NUADA: Demon.

818
01:02:00,681 --> 01:02:02,786
What are you waiting for?

819
01:02:02,916 --> 01:02:05,021
This is what you
wanted, isn't it?

820
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:08,125
Look at it.
It's the last
of its kind.

821
01:02:12,293 --> 01:02:14,998
Like you and l.
You destroy it,

see its like again.

823
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:22,572
JOHANN: Shoot it!

824
01:02:22,637 --> 01:02:25,108
You have more
in common with us
than with them.

825
01:02:25,172 --> 01:02:26,409
JOHANN: It's breaking free.

826
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:28,010
You could be a king.

827
01:02:28,143 --> 01:02:29,679
JOHANN: You will not
disobey a direct order!

828
01:02:29,744 --> 01:02:31,514
Shoot it!
It's getting loose!

829

830
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:33,882
JOHANN: It will
destroy everything!

831
01:02:33,947 --> 01:02:35,150
That's an order,
Agent Hellboy!

832
01:02:35,215 --> 01:02:36,385
... then you must obey.

833
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:38,322
JOHANN: Shoot it now!
Damn.

834
01:02:39,688 --> 01:02:40,956
Shoot it!

835
01:03:13,688 --> 01:03:17,463
AGENT: Move back.
Step back, step back.

836
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:54,563
lt's beautiful.

837
01:04:17,284 --> 01:04:21,159
WOMAN:... and this huge
monster just came
out of nowhere!

838
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:32,436
MAN: Yo, give the
baby back, man!

839
01:04:33,201 --> 01:04:36,005
Oh, what have you
done to my baby?

840
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,106
The baby's fine.

841
01:04:37,172 --> 01:04:38,206
You freak!

842
01:04:38,273 --> 01:04:39,442
REPORTER: Hellboy,
what'd you do to that baby?

843
01:04:39,507 --> 01:04:40,775
The baby's fine.

844
01:04:40,842 --> 01:04:43,378
Don't move.
Hands in the air! Up!

845
01:04:43,445 --> 01:04:45,079
He's got a weapon
in his hand.

846
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:47,115
That is his hand.

847
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:49,954
Miss, stay away from him
for your own safety.

848
01:04:50,018 --> 01:04:52,121
He was trying to help.
Don't you see?

849
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,490
He was just trying to help.

850
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,894
That's all we do.

851
01:04:57,958 --> 01:04:59,429
That's all we've
done all these years.

852
01:04:59,494 --> 01:05:00,929
REPORTER: She's touching
his hand!

853
01:05:00,994 --> 01:05:04,168
We've iust tried to
help you. You.

854
01:05:05,733 --> 01:05:07,670
MAN 1: You're a goddamn freak.

855
01:05:08,268 --> 01:05:10,271
MAN 2: We don't need
you around!

856
01:05:23,384 --> 01:05:24,887

858
01:05:33,795 --> 01:05:35,297

You did a good iob

Then tell me, why

01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:06,733
l mean, l killed that thing.
And for what?

866
01:06:08,463 --> 01:06:10,432
They don't even like me.

867
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:13,335
l mean, they're afraid of me.

868
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:15,938
What do we do with that?

869
01:06:16,304 --> 01:06:19,376
Red, l don't want

About what?

873
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:32,588
Can't you do your
thinking right here?

874
01:06:32,753 --> 01:06:34,690
Look, l'll be really,
really quiet.

875
01:06:34,755 --> 01:06:36,659
l'll get rid of the cats.

876
01:06:38,293 --> 01:06:40,329
Red, why are you with me?

877
01:06:41,295 --> 01:06:44,101
Do you need
everyone to like you?

878
01:06:44,164 --> 01:06:47,403
Everybody?
Or am l enough?

879
01:06:48,536 --> 01:06:50,072
Think about it.

880
01:06:58,445 --> 01:07:02,387
You stay.
We belong dead.

881
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,862
NUALA: It's blank.
No coordinates.

882
01:07:26,074 --> 01:07:28,746
NUALA: ''Be near me
when my light is low

883
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:33,318
''When the blood
creeps and the nerves
prick and tingle

884
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:38,090
''And the heart
is sick and all
the wheels of being slow

885
01:07:39,019 --> 01:07:44,831
''Be near me when the sensuous
frame is wracked with
pangs that conquer trust

886
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:46,896
''And time, a maniac... ''

887
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:50,068
ABE: Tennyson,
''ln Memoriam. ''
A beautiful poem.

888
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:51,800
Forgive me, l didn't
mean to startle you.

889
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:54,103
Oh, no. No, no.
l borrowed this book.

890
01:07:54,168 --> 01:07:55,237
l hope you don't mind.

891
01:07:55,302 --> 01:07:58,275
Oh, no, no. Please,
this is your home now.

892
01:07:58,338 --> 01:07:59,606
You are safe here.

893
01:07:59,673 --> 01:08:02,246
My brother will find me.
He always does.

894
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:03,445
How could he?

895
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:05,014
Our location is a highly
classified secret.

896
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:07,717
Yes, but l know of
it now, which means
that he does, too.

897
01:08:07,782 --> 01:08:09,085
We're twins.

898
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:12,724
Even as children,
a link has bound us
one to the other.

899
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,157
Something l cannot explain.

900
01:08:15,623 --> 01:08:16,826
No need.

901
01:08:19,694 --> 01:08:21,064
You look different.

902
01:08:21,128 --> 01:08:22,430
Oh, do l?

903
01:08:22,496 --> 01:08:23,699
Perhaps my hair?

904
01:08:23,765 --> 01:08:24,899
No.

905
01:08:24,966 --> 01:08:28,305
lt's your eyes.
l can see your eyes.

906
01:08:28,368 --> 01:08:32,643
Yes. Just trying
a new look.

907
01:08:37,045 --> 01:08:38,579
ls that a map?

908
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:42,118
Yes, it was in the cylinder.

909
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:44,186
There are no coordinates.

910
01:08:47,922 --> 01:08:50,159
Perhaps there's
a watermark.

911
01:08:53,161 --> 01:08:56,166
You were very brave
vouching for me.

912
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:59,537
How do you know
l'm not the enemy,
bringing me here?

913
01:09:00,635 --> 01:09:02,704
lt's as you were
saying just now.

914
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:07,311
From intuition maybe,
a link.

915
01:09:10,244 --> 01:09:13,317
Normally l'm
able to read others
quite quickly,

916
01:09:14,347 --> 01:09:16,787
but l've never met
anyone like you.

917
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:20,922
Nor l, like you.

918
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,095
Good night, Abraham.

919
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:27,695
Good night, Princess.
Your Highness.

920
01:09:27,762 --> 01:09:29,599
Your Maiesty.
Your... Ma'am.

921
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:31,365
Ma'am?

922
01:10:04,164 --> 01:10:06,269
Gute Nacht,
Agent Hellboy.

923
01:10:10,404 --> 01:10:13,210
Look, Agent,
l know you don't like me,

924
01:10:13,274 --> 01:10:15,011
but l could take
away your badge.

925
01:10:15,076 --> 01:10:16,979
Never had one.

926
01:10:17,045 --> 01:10:19,215
Kept asking, though.

927
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:21,484
You will learn to
obey me, follow protocol

928
01:10:21,548 --> 01:10:23,685
and stay fockused
at all times.

929
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:26,288
Oh, that word ''fockused. ''

930
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:29,460
Yeah, with your
accent, l wouldn't
use it that much.

931
01:10:29,524 --> 01:10:31,527
l knew Professor Broom,
young man.

932
01:10:31,591 --> 01:10:32,828
You didn't know
Professor Broom.

933
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:34,061
Yes, l did.

934
01:10:34,127 --> 01:10:35,497
After my accident...
Shut up. Shut up.

935
01:10:35,563 --> 01:10:37,198
... he designed
this containment suit.

936
01:10:37,265 --> 01:10:38,868
A wonderful man.

937
01:10:38,932 --> 01:10:40,336
And even then
he was worried
about your future. He...

938
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,270
Hey, Gas Bag, stop it!

939
01:10:44,104 --> 01:10:45,140
Right now.

940
01:10:45,206 --> 01:10:47,475
Or what?
Are you threatening me?

941
01:10:47,675 --> 01:10:50,012
Because l think
l can take you.

942
01:10:52,512 --> 01:10:53,648
Excuse me?

943
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,016
You heard me.

944
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:00,757
l couldn't hear you
from all the way over there.

945
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:04,595
l can take you
because you have
one fatal flaw.

946
01:11:05,626 --> 01:11:06,728
Oh, l wanna hear it.

947
01:11:06,793 --> 01:11:09,131
No, you don't.
You can't take criticism.

948
01:11:09,197 --> 01:11:10,899
Try me.

949
01:11:11,032 --> 01:11:12,734
Can't take it.

950
01:11:15,203 --> 01:11:17,073
What's my flaw?

951
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:20,042
Your temper.
It gets the best of you.

952
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:22,744
Makes you weak.
Makes you vulnerable.

953
01:11:26,846 --> 01:11:27,847
Oh, crap.

954
01:11:29,016 --> 01:11:30,185
Johann.

955
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:37,994
Johann? Johann?

956
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:41,963
Hey, Johann?

957
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,837
Come on, pal.
Hang in there,
will you?

958
01:11:48,903 --> 01:11:51,274
Johann? Johann?

959
01:11:55,443 --> 01:11:56,444
Damn.

960
01:12:00,614 --> 01:12:01,615
Ow!

961
01:12:39,787 --> 01:12:41,157
There we are.

962
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:42,791
Your temper,
it makes you sloppy.

963
01:12:42,856 --> 01:12:44,827
Try to control it,
Agent Hellboy.

964
01:12:44,891 --> 01:12:46,795
Before it controls you.

965
01:12:55,235 --> 01:12:56,570
Glasshole.

966
01:13:03,677 --> 01:13:04,679
Mmm.

967
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:11,685
Huh?

968
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:29,104
Hello, Red.

969
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,404
Well, you're up late.

970
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:31,672
What are you listening to?

971
01:13:31,738 --> 01:13:34,743
Vivaldi.
Il címento dell'armonía.

972
01:13:34,807 --> 01:13:36,179
l particularly
like the last...

973
01:13:36,243 --> 01:13:37,578
Hey, hey. What's that?

974
01:13:37,645 --> 01:13:39,314
Just a remote.

975
01:13:41,814 --> 01:13:43,653
This? Yes.

976
01:13:45,853 --> 01:13:47,789
''Popular Love Songs. ''

977
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:52,194
Oh, Abe.

978
01:13:53,261 --> 01:13:55,731
You fell for the Princess.

979
01:13:56,329 --> 01:13:58,935
She's... She's like me.

980
01:13:58,998 --> 01:14:01,337
A creature from
another world.

981
01:14:02,836 --> 01:14:05,274
You need to get out more.

982
01:14:05,338 --> 01:14:08,311
She's alone in the world.
l wanna help her.

983
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:10,579
l need to care for her.

984
01:14:12,613 --> 01:14:14,917
You're in love.
Have a beer.

985
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:15,983
Oh, my body's a temple.

986
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,118
Well, now it's an
amusement park.

987
01:14:17,185 --> 01:14:18,185
No, no, no.

988
01:14:18,252 --> 01:14:19,253
The glandular balance of...

989
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:21,524
Just shut up and
drink it, would you?

990
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:26,363
What track?
Eight.

991
01:14:26,426 --> 01:14:28,997
Can't Smíle Wíthout You.

992
01:14:29,063 --> 01:14:30,399
l know.

993
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:32,467
Yep, l'm gonna need
a beer, too.

994
01:14:32,533 --> 01:14:34,802
Well, see, l love this song.

995
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:37,506
And l can't smile or cry.

996
01:14:37,572 --> 01:14:39,876
l think l have
no tear ducts.

997
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:45,280
l wish Father were here.

998
01:14:45,345 --> 01:14:48,417
He'd know what to tell
you. Us.

999
01:14:56,356 --> 01:15:00,698
l can't smíle wíthout you

1000
01:15:00,795 --> 01:15:05,404
l can't laugh

1001
01:15:06,065 --> 01:15:09,806
l'm fíndíng ít hard
to do anythíng

1002
01:15:09,869 --> 01:15:15,780
You see,
l feel sad when
you're sad

1003
01:15:16,444 --> 01:15:20,819
I feel glad when you're glad

1004
01:15:20,881 --> 01:15:25,689
lf you only knew
what l'm goíng through

1005
01:15:26,787 --> 01:15:33,533
l just can't
smíle wíthout you

1006
01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:37,934
You came along

1007
01:15:37,997 --> 01:15:40,235
Just líke a song

1008
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:43,539
And bríghtened my day

1009
01:15:43,604 --> 01:15:47,912
Who'd have belíeved
that you were
part of a dream?

1010
01:15:47,975 --> 01:15:53,319
Now ít all seems
líght years away

1011
01:15:53,381 --> 01:15:59,559
And now you know l can't
smíle wíthout you

1012
01:16:00,753 --> 01:16:04,729
l can't smíle wíthout you

1013
01:16:06,226 --> 01:16:07,695
NUADA: Nuala.

1014
01:16:17,938 --> 01:16:19,206
Good dog.

1015
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:33,055
MAN: Securíty detaíl
for the front gate,
ímmedíately.

1016
01:16:51,939 --> 01:16:53,708
lt's the last one.

1017
01:16:58,945 --> 01:17:02,386
HELLBOY: Look at her.
She's it, Abe.

1018
01:17:02,983 --> 01:17:03,984
She's it.

1019
01:17:04,118 --> 01:17:06,055
She's my whole wide...

1020
01:17:08,355 --> 01:17:09,356
You know?

1021
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,028
Yeah. Yeah.

1022
01:17:13,092 --> 01:17:15,497
l would give
my life for her.

1023
01:17:17,197 --> 01:17:19,935
But she also wants me
to do the dishes.

1024
01:17:21,301 --> 01:17:24,675
l would die
and do the dishes.

1025
01:17:24,738 --> 01:17:26,742
Why is she mad at me?

1026
01:17:26,806 --> 01:17:28,443
lt's not because
the room is dirty.

1027
01:17:28,509 --> 01:17:30,078
Something else.

1028
01:17:31,145 --> 01:17:33,649
Well, ask her, then.

1029
01:17:33,713 --> 01:17:35,617
No.

1030
01:17:35,882 --> 01:17:37,252
Listen, Abe.

1031
01:17:37,317 --> 01:17:38,318
Yeah.

1032
01:17:38,386 --> 01:17:40,322
When a woman's
mad about something,

1033
01:17:40,387 --> 01:17:42,289
but she's really mad
about something else,

1034
01:17:42,355 --> 01:17:46,197
you can't ask because
then they get angry
because you had to ask.

1035
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:47,695
Do you know what l mean?

1036
01:17:47,761 --> 01:17:50,132
Never mind,
don't answer
that question.

1037
01:17:50,197 --> 01:17:51,899
You gotta just...

1038
01:17:52,766 --> 01:17:53,868
Yeah.

1039
01:17:54,868 --> 01:17:56,037
... find out.

1040
01:18:03,076 --> 01:18:04,880
Very quick of you.
The parchment.

1041
01:18:04,944 --> 01:18:06,715
lt was of no importance.

1042
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:11,489
The cylinder is
very interesting.

1043
01:18:16,556 --> 01:18:18,993
We will find
the Golden Army here.

1044
01:18:20,894 --> 01:18:24,067
As for the crown piece,
l know it's here.

1045
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:29,005
l can feel that
much from you.

1046
01:18:30,404 --> 01:18:34,110
Father always tried
so hard to shield your
heart from mine.

1047
01:18:37,578 --> 01:18:40,750
But it's in one of the books,
and l will find it.

1048
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,382
Blue.

1049
01:18:42,817 --> 01:18:45,488
You always look
so beautiful in blue.

1050
01:18:46,886 --> 01:18:48,021
Blue.

1051
01:18:49,055 --> 01:18:51,260
Poetry. ''Love.

1052
01:18:52,326 --> 01:18:55,030
''Found then lost. ''

1053
01:18:56,596 --> 01:18:59,100
Only words.
l will find it.

1054
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:02,570
ABE: Listen, listen, Red.

1055
01:19:02,636 --> 01:19:06,042
l know what's
going on with Liz.

1056
01:19:06,105 --> 01:19:07,542
Red.

1057
01:19:07,608 --> 01:19:09,143
Abe.

1058
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:11,746
l'm sorry.
He has to know.

1059
01:19:11,811 --> 01:19:12,913
Abe!

1060
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:14,349
Know what?

1061
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,021
Why?

1062
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,925
ABE: Stay back.
l'll go first.

1063
01:19:22,989 --> 01:19:26,529
Abraham. No, don't...
He'll kill you.

1064
01:19:26,594 --> 01:19:27,962
Princess?

1065
01:19:28,028 --> 01:19:29,396
NUADA: Abraham?

1066
01:19:31,398 --> 01:19:32,801
No!

1067
01:19:32,932 --> 01:19:34,670
l will kill you, Abraham.

1068
01:19:36,103 --> 01:19:38,574
And anyone else
if that is necessary.

1069
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,009
HELLBOY: Well?

1070
01:19:43,243 --> 01:19:48,319
Then why don't you
just start with me,
Your Royal Assness?

1071
01:19:48,381 --> 01:19:49,818
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1072
01:19:49,884 --> 01:19:51,286
Who put those there?

1073
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:52,953
And your weapon of choice?

1074
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,524
Five-fingered Mary.

1075
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,862
You move and l'll kill
your Abraham first.

1076
01:20:10,069 --> 01:20:11,640
Red, you mustn't
harm the Prince.

1077
01:20:11,704 --> 01:20:12,841
What?

1078
01:20:12,907 --> 01:20:15,645
lf you hurt him,
you hurt the Princess.

1079
01:20:17,043 --> 01:20:19,347
You've gotta be kidding me.

1080
01:20:24,384 --> 01:20:25,519
NUADA: Will you give me
the crown piece?

1081
01:20:25,586 --> 01:20:26,854
No.

1082
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:38,500
The piece.
No.

1083
01:21:08,729 --> 01:21:09,729
Abe?

1084
01:21:09,796 --> 01:21:11,064
Red, l'm so sorry,
but they're linked.

1085
01:21:11,131 --> 01:21:12,365
JOHANN: What's going on?

1086
01:21:12,431 --> 01:21:14,002
Red.
Liz.

1087
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:15,837
Red, behind you.

1088
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:21,345
You may have
mused in the past,
''Am l mortal?''

1089
01:21:26,947 --> 01:21:28,349
You are now.

1090
01:21:34,954 --> 01:21:38,695
NUADA: Abraham,
many people have
died for this crown.

1091
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:42,063
He will, too.

1092
01:21:43,296 --> 01:21:48,172
lf you want to save him
and see her again,

1093
01:21:49,235 --> 01:21:52,810
you will find
the missing piece
and bring it to me.

1094
01:22:29,609 --> 01:22:32,081
Jesus, Abe, pull the
damn thing out!

1095
01:22:32,145 --> 01:22:33,381
l cannot.

1096
01:22:33,447 --> 01:22:36,820
Every time l touch it,
every time l
come close to it,

1097
01:22:36,884 --> 01:22:38,854
it moves closer
to his heart.

1098
01:22:38,918 --> 01:22:40,654
l don't know
what else to do.

1099
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:44,027
The wound will not heal
until the spear is removed.

1100
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:47,729
We're running out of time.

1101
01:22:47,795 --> 01:22:49,631
Then we go after the Prince.

1102
01:22:51,064 --> 01:22:53,301
And we make him
take it out.

1103
01:22:55,234 --> 01:22:56,569
Hey, Liz.

1104
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:58,139
You were asking me.

1105
01:22:58,204 --> 01:22:59,340
Don't talk.

1106
01:22:59,405 --> 01:23:00,975
No, no, let me tell you.

1107
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:02,743
l know what's important.

1108
01:23:04,676 --> 01:23:05,747
lt's you.

1109
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:07,247
Red.

1110
01:23:07,747 --> 01:23:10,953
l could turn my back
on the world, all of it,

1111
01:23:14,121 --> 01:23:15,823
as long as you stay with me.

1112
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:17,692
l'll stay with you.

1113
01:23:18,492 --> 01:23:20,963
You're the best man
l've ever met.

1114
01:23:26,365 --> 01:23:27,367
''Man. ''

1115
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,832
NUALA: ''Be near me
when my líght ís low

1116
01:23:56,896 --> 01:23:58,332
''When the blood creeps

1117
01:23:58,398 --> 01:24:03,407
''And the heart
ís síck and all
the wheels of beíng slow''

1118
01:24:09,943 --> 01:24:11,613
JOHANN: The cylinder
yielded coordinates

1119
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:13,815
to County Antrim,
Northern Ireland.

1120
01:24:14,247 --> 01:24:17,420
The Giant's Causeway.
Right about here.

1121
01:24:19,086 --> 01:24:20,889
Great. So we know
where he is.

1122
01:24:20,953 --> 01:24:21,989
What are we waiting for?

1123
01:24:22,055 --> 01:24:23,158
We should get going.

1124
01:24:23,222 --> 01:24:26,127
The Prince will
demand the crown piece,
Agent Sherman.

1125
01:24:26,193 --> 01:24:27,863
So we give it to him.

1126
01:24:27,927 --> 01:24:29,329
Dr. Manning?

1127
01:24:29,395 --> 01:24:32,033
l'm afraid it's not
as simple as that.

1128
01:24:32,731 --> 01:24:34,001
Hold on here,
what are you saying?

1129
01:24:34,068 --> 01:24:36,404
The Golden Army
must not awaken.

1130
01:24:37,537 --> 01:24:39,140
LIZ: So, what?

1131
01:24:39,206 --> 01:24:41,577
You're iust gonna let
him die, is that it?

1132
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,708
JOHANN: l'm sorry.

1133
01:24:42,774 --> 01:24:45,180
We called Washington.
We have our orders.

1134
01:24:46,279 --> 01:24:48,550
And what about you?
He saved your life.

1135
01:24:48,614 --> 01:24:50,185
l know.

1136
01:24:53,286 --> 01:24:55,289
l know this is
difficult for you, but...

1137
01:24:55,354 --> 01:24:57,024
Well, l won't
Iet him die.

1138
01:24:57,091 --> 01:24:58,827
Agent Sherman,
may l remind you

1139
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:01,864
that l am the leader
of this team.

1140
01:25:01,929 --> 01:25:03,664
Oh, there's no doubt
about that, sir.

1141
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:05,667
That is what you
are, Dr. Krauss.

1142
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:09,605
And if ever you were human,
that time is long gone.

1143
01:25:11,104 --> 01:25:13,074
MANNING: What's wrong
with her?

1144
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,307
You want me to
call her back, sir?

1145
01:25:14,373 --> 01:25:15,609
Let her go.

1146
01:25:15,807 --> 01:25:17,244
l understand.

1147
01:25:18,212 --> 01:25:20,015
What about you?

1148
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:21,515
You find anything?

1149
01:25:21,581 --> 01:25:22,984
No. Nothing yet.

1150
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:24,519
Well, keep looking.

1151
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:25,987
Absolutely, sir.

1152
01:25:26,052 --> 01:25:27,788
All of you.

1153
01:25:27,854 --> 01:25:30,759
But don't worry,
sir, we know it's here,
and we're gonna find it.

1154
01:25:30,823 --> 01:25:32,929
When Tom Manning
gets on the case,
things get done.

1155
01:25:32,993 --> 01:25:35,229
They get done.
They get done!

1156
01:25:35,795 --> 01:25:38,734
100O_. l guarantee that.

1157
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,622
Even without the piece,
we have to get
him out of here.

1158
01:25:58,685 --> 01:26:01,556
We'll go to
Antrim, and we will
find the Prince.

1159
01:26:01,621 --> 01:26:02,823
MANNING: Keep looking.

1160
01:26:02,889 --> 01:26:03,923
l ask you, everybody,
keep looking.

1161
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,992
Abe.

1162
01:26:08,595 --> 01:26:10,431
Just the two of us.

1163
01:26:11,131 --> 01:26:12,967
Yes. Yes.

1164
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,902
Let's go.

1165
01:26:31,185 --> 01:26:34,591
We need to leave now,
before they run our
clearance upstairs.

1166
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,126
Guten Abend,
meíne freunde.

1167
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:39,761
Do you have authorization
to take that plane?

1168
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:43,230
You're not gonna
stop us, Johann.

1169
01:26:43,296 --> 01:26:45,768
On the contrary,
l've been giving
it some thought,

1170
01:26:45,832 --> 01:26:48,804
and we should be able
to save Agent Hellboy.

1171
01:26:49,636 --> 01:26:53,210
You say l'm not
human anymore,
but you are wrong.

1172
01:26:53,273 --> 01:26:55,909
l understand your
pain all too well.

1173
01:26:55,975 --> 01:26:58,947
A long time ago,
l lost the woman l loved.

1174
01:26:59,012 --> 01:27:02,586
And that was, in fact,
the source of my
present misfortune.

1175
01:27:02,649 --> 01:27:04,284
l will tell you
about it one day.

1176
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:07,289
But for now, the tactical
advantage is ours.

1177
01:27:07,354 --> 01:27:10,193
Consider this,
the Prince lacks
the crown piece

1178
01:27:10,256 --> 01:27:12,860
and without it,
his army poses
no threat.

1179
01:27:12,925 --> 01:27:14,362
So we have clearance, then?

1180
01:27:14,426 --> 01:27:18,068
Agent Sherman, Liz,
screw the clearance.

1181
01:27:18,731 --> 01:27:20,702
We will take that plane!

1182
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:46,394
lt should be here someplace.

1183
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:50,501
The entrance should be here.

1184
01:27:50,564 --> 01:27:51,932
l don't understand.

1185
01:27:51,997 --> 01:27:54,569
JOHANN: Perhaps there's
a mistake on the map.

1186
01:27:59,872 --> 01:28:01,376
GOBLIN: Hello there!

1187
01:28:03,409 --> 01:28:05,011
l bid you welcome, strangers.

1188
01:28:05,078 --> 01:28:06,613
How can l be of assistance?

1189
01:28:06,679 --> 01:28:08,783
We seek safe
passage to Bethmoora.

1190
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:12,387
And what does a nice
little girl like you
want in the nightlands?

1191
01:28:12,452 --> 01:28:14,288
We are looking
for Prince Nuada.

1192
01:28:14,354 --> 01:28:15,823
Him, l know.

1193
01:28:15,889 --> 01:28:18,059
Trade me something,
and l'll take you to him.

1194
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:20,462
Here. l have a shiny belt.

1195
01:28:20,594 --> 01:28:22,965
But l have no pants.

1196
01:28:23,029 --> 01:28:26,068
Look, a wonderful
set of magic eyes.

1197
01:28:26,132 --> 01:28:28,170
l already have binoculars.

1198
01:28:29,202 --> 01:28:34,179
But l see something special,
something shiny
underneath the bandages.

1199
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,710
l want that.

1200
01:28:35,774 --> 01:28:37,411
No, you can't take it out.

1201
01:28:37,476 --> 01:28:39,514
Not without killing him.

1202
01:28:40,979 --> 01:28:42,750
Maybe l know someone
who can.

1203
01:28:42,815 --> 01:28:44,552
Will you trade me then?

1204
01:28:50,323 --> 01:28:51,525
All right.

1205
01:28:51,591 --> 01:28:52,826
Very well.

1206
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:06,634
Keep going. Keep going.

1207
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:22,483
Oh, my God.

1208
01:30:34,461 --> 01:30:37,667
GOBLIN: You should have
seen this city
when it was alive.

1209
01:30:40,033 --> 01:30:41,435
What happened to it?

1210
01:30:41,501 --> 01:30:42,502
GOBLIN: Curse.

1211
01:30:42,569 --> 01:30:44,838
As soon as
the Golden Army
was stored here,

1212
01:30:44,904 --> 01:30:47,408
a plague of silence
and death befell us.

1213
01:30:47,474 --> 01:30:49,778
And the world left us behind.

1214
01:30:56,983 --> 01:30:59,921
GOBLIN: For a long time,
l alone dwelled in the dust.

1215
01:31:03,189 --> 01:31:07,195
All right, little girl,
the two of you come inside.

1216
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,564
The rest of you,
wait out here.

1217
01:31:25,377 --> 01:31:26,747
Hello, old friend.

1218
01:31:26,813 --> 01:31:28,649
l have brought you visitors.

1219
01:31:32,051 --> 01:31:35,055
And l have
a favor to ask you.

1220
01:31:35,121 --> 01:31:38,828
l owe no favor to
you, goblin. Leave.

1221
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:40,895
GOBLIN: But l have done
so much for you.

1222
01:31:41,027 --> 01:31:43,131
l have brought
you many souvenirs.

1223
01:31:44,029 --> 01:31:46,167
And he has something shiny.

1224
01:31:46,231 --> 01:31:47,400
Red.

1225
01:31:47,466 --> 01:31:48,601
GOBLIN: Something mine.

1226
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:49,668
Red!

1227
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:57,712
Anung un Rama.

1228
01:31:57,777 --> 01:31:58,845
You know that name?

1229
01:31:58,911 --> 01:32:03,621
And yours.
Elizabeth Sherman.

1230
01:32:09,354 --> 01:32:12,094
At last.

1231
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:18,168
l have been
waiting for you both
many a winter moon.

1232
01:32:20,699 --> 01:32:24,305
l am his death,

1233
01:32:24,369 --> 01:32:29,246
and l will meet him
at each crossroads.

1234
01:32:29,307 --> 01:32:32,247
Good. But when can l have
that which is mine?

1235
01:32:33,445 --> 01:32:34,815
Can you save him?

1236
01:32:34,881 --> 01:32:37,385
lt is for you to decide that.

1237
01:32:37,449 --> 01:32:39,386
lt is all the same to me.

1238
01:32:39,452 --> 01:32:44,595
My heart is filled
with dust and sand,

1239
01:32:44,658 --> 01:32:48,966
but you should know
it is his destiny

1240
01:32:50,128 --> 01:32:53,301
to bring about the
destruction of the Earth.

1241
01:32:54,367 --> 01:33:00,813
Not now, not tomorrow,
but soon enough.

1242
01:33:05,511 --> 01:33:10,889
Knowing that, you still
want him to live?

1243
01:33:19,626 --> 01:33:24,033
So, child, make the choice.

1244
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:27,671
The world or him?

1245
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,435
Him.

1246
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:35,945
The time will come
and you, my dear,

1247
01:33:36,007 --> 01:33:39,280
will suffer more than anyone.

1248
01:33:39,345 --> 01:33:41,148
l'll deal with it.

1249
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:44,417
Now save him.

1250
01:33:44,484 --> 01:33:48,056
lt is done.

1251
01:33:52,926 --> 01:33:55,195
l have done what l can.

1252
01:33:55,293 --> 01:34:00,302
Now, give him
a reason to live.

1253
01:34:05,104 --> 01:34:09,512
Hey, friend, what
about that which is mine?

1254
01:34:09,576 --> 01:34:13,315
Don't forget about me.
What about me?

1255
01:34:13,378 --> 01:34:14,715
Friend?

1256
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:26,158
Shiny.

1257
01:34:31,564 --> 01:34:34,770
Listen to me, you big ape.

1258
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:38,974
You have to get up.

1259
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,510
You have to get up.

1260
01:34:46,212 --> 01:34:48,617
'Cause you're
gonna be a father.

1261
01:35:06,498 --> 01:35:08,168
l become

1262
01:35:10,804 --> 01:35:11,805
father?

1263
01:35:23,949 --> 01:35:26,755
Well, all this is
very touching,

1264
01:35:26,819 --> 01:35:31,828
but if you still
want to meet Nuada,
we have to leave now.

1265
01:35:32,692 --> 01:35:33,726
Ready.

1266
01:35:41,768 --> 01:35:43,136
Here we are.

1267
01:35:44,738 --> 01:35:47,141
And there they are.

1268
01:35:47,206 --> 01:35:50,545
Seventy times 70 soldiers.

1269
01:35:51,109 --> 01:35:54,149
Sometimes l wish
l'd never created them.

1270
01:35:54,212 --> 01:35:55,815
Bim-bam went the hammers!

1271
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:57,551
Whoosh went the furnaces!

1272
01:35:57,615 --> 01:36:01,222
And one of those fires
took my legs off, now.

1273
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:04,158
This is as far as l can go.

1274
01:36:04,222 --> 01:36:06,795
l'm not very
good with steps.

1275
01:36:06,859 --> 01:36:11,735
But if you're here to
stop him, the Prince,
l wish you luck then.

1276
01:36:11,797 --> 01:36:13,801
The Golden Army
must not awaken.

1277
01:36:13,867 --> 01:36:15,069
Undo what we did.

1278
01:36:15,134 --> 01:36:16,135
We will.

1279
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,689
NUADA: You're here.

1280
01:36:36,756 --> 01:36:38,926
So l assume you brought
the remaining piece.

1281
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:40,828
JOHANN: No. We didn't,
but we should discuss...

1282
01:36:40,894 --> 01:36:43,198
l'm not addressing you,
Tin Man.

1283
01:36:44,262 --> 01:36:45,364
Abraham.

1284
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:46,533
Abraham?

1285
01:36:46,599 --> 01:36:47,801
My sister is well
as l promised, so...

1286
01:36:47,867 --> 01:36:49,569
Abe?

1287
01:36:52,537 --> 01:36:54,708
What the hell are you doing?

1288
01:36:54,841 --> 01:36:57,011
You would do
the exact same for Liz.

1289
01:36:57,076 --> 01:36:58,746
JOHANN: Agent Sapien, no!

1290
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:24,605
l am Prince Nuada,
Silverlance,

1291
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:26,707
leader of the Golden Army.

1292
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:31,447
ls there anyone here
who would dispute my right?

1293
01:38:50,622 --> 01:38:51,725
Kill them.

1294
01:38:51,789 --> 01:38:52,893
But...

1295
01:38:54,292 --> 01:38:55,828
He lied to us.

1296
01:38:57,796 --> 01:39:01,502
Abe, old buddy,
if we ever get out of
this, we gotta talk.

1297
01:39:29,728 --> 01:39:31,064
Open wide!

1298
01:39:40,773 --> 01:39:42,810
lndustrable, my ass.

1299
01:40:22,881 --> 01:40:25,152
Hey! Throw me a bone here!

1300
01:42:04,783 --> 01:42:06,118
Oh, crap.

1301
01:42:09,454 --> 01:42:11,358
JOHANN: Well
l'm out of idea's.

1302
01:42:19,597 --> 01:42:21,134
l got one.

1303
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:25,073
l challenge Prince Nuada

1304
01:42:26,572 --> 01:42:30,246
for the right to
command this army.

1305
01:42:36,046 --> 01:42:38,386
You challenge me?

1306
01:42:38,451 --> 01:42:39,985
Who are you
to challenge me?

1307
01:42:40,051 --> 01:42:41,521
You are nobody.

1308
01:42:42,387 --> 01:42:43,856
You are not royalty.

1309
01:42:43,921 --> 01:42:48,197
Yes. Yes!
He is Anung un Rama,
son of the Fallen One.

1310
01:42:48,261 --> 01:42:49,328
He has the right.

1311
01:42:49,395 --> 01:42:51,231
A challenge must
be answered.

1312
01:42:54,865 --> 01:42:56,369
Very well then.

1313
01:42:56,435 --> 01:42:57,636
Red, please.
Red. Think about it.

1314
01:42:57,703 --> 01:42:58,703
Guys. Guys!
He will kill you.

1315
01:42:58,770 --> 01:43:00,541
Don't do this, Red.

1316
01:43:01,306 --> 01:43:03,444
Don't worry, babe.

1317
01:43:03,509 --> 01:43:05,746
l'm not gonna kill him, Abe.

1318
01:43:06,377 --> 01:43:08,381
But l am gonna
kick his ass.

1319
01:44:39,337 --> 01:44:40,338
Whoa!

1320
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:17,042
Red.

1321
01:45:18,676 --> 01:45:19,677
Hey!

1322
01:45:28,019 --> 01:45:29,323
Nice ride, huh?

1323
01:46:09,327 --> 01:46:11,564
You jumpy, slippery bastard.

1324
01:46:12,797 --> 01:46:14,065
l got you now.

1325
01:46:23,708 --> 01:46:27,314
Kill me. You must,
for l will not stop.

1326
01:46:27,378 --> 01:46:28,981
l cannot.
Sorry, pal.

1327
01:46:30,347 --> 01:46:31,516
l win.

1328
01:46:32,484 --> 01:46:33,720
You live.

1329
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:05,717
Nuala.

1330
01:47:34,179 --> 01:47:35,515
The humans,

1331
01:47:38,216 --> 01:47:40,554
they will tire of you.

1332
01:47:40,618 --> 01:47:42,454
They have already
turned against you.

1333
01:47:42,954 --> 01:47:44,122
Leave them.

1334
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:48,362
ls it them or us?

1335
01:47:51,529 --> 01:47:53,934
Which holocaust
should be chosen?

1336
01:48:05,176 --> 01:48:09,083
l never had a chance
to tell you how l felt.

1337
01:48:10,347 --> 01:48:12,018
Give me your hand.

1338
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:24,663
lt's beautiful.

1339
01:48:25,764 --> 01:48:27,099
We die

1340
01:48:29,301 --> 01:48:31,939
and the world will
be poorer for it.

1341
01:48:46,018 --> 01:48:48,221
Nuala, my sister.

1342
01:49:32,163 --> 01:49:33,265
All that power.

1343
01:49:33,331 --> 01:49:35,068
Don't even think about it.

1344
01:50:24,349 --> 01:50:25,918
MANNING: No. No, it's nothing.

1345
01:50:25,984 --> 01:50:27,820
l told you,
it's a dead end.

1346
01:50:28,252 --> 01:50:30,623
What are you doing?
Go away.

1347
01:50:30,689 --> 01:50:32,591
Check the belt locator.

1348
01:50:33,692 --> 01:50:36,363
Check the belt locators,
over there.

1349
01:50:38,262 --> 01:50:39,765
Over there.

1350
01:50:43,435 --> 01:50:46,707
You, you took that plane
without an authorization,
young man.

1351
01:50:46,771 --> 01:50:49,443
Hey. Manning.

1352
01:50:49,539 --> 01:50:51,645
Here to help as always.

1353
01:50:51,710 --> 01:50:54,113
What's going on?
What's going on?

1354
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,114
l quit.

1355
01:50:57,082 --> 01:50:58,484
What? Are you serious?

1356
01:50:58,548 --> 01:50:59,920
Looks that way,
doesn't it?

1357
01:50:59,984 --> 01:51:02,823
What's wrong with you?
You can't all just quit.

1358
01:51:02,887 --> 01:51:04,222
Watch us.

1359
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:07,659
On second thought,

1360
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:10,997
l think l'll keep this.

1361
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:14,868
Come on. Come on!

1362
01:51:16,167 --> 01:51:18,972
Johann, they can't do this.
Stop them.

1363
01:51:19,037 --> 01:51:22,475
Dr. Manning, suck my
ectoplasmic schwanzstucker.

1364
01:51:23,207 --> 01:51:24,510
LIZ: So what you said before,

1365
01:51:24,574 --> 01:51:25,945
about us living anywhere.

1366
01:51:26,011 --> 01:51:27,179
MANNING: Guys. Guys!

1367
01:51:27,244 --> 01:51:29,381
Anywhere. You and me.
MANNING: Come on back.

1368
01:51:29,447 --> 01:51:30,481
Let's find a place
in the country.

1369
01:51:30,547 --> 01:51:31,716
l said come on back.

1370
01:51:31,783 --> 01:51:33,820
Clean air.
Green hills.

1371
01:51:34,752 --> 01:51:38,326
A yard with lots
of room to grow in.

1372
01:51:38,389 --> 01:51:39,725
lt'll be great
for the baby.

1373
01:51:39,792 --> 01:51:41,027
Babies.

1374
