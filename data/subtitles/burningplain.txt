The Burning Plain



- Subtitle -
Completely fixed: titler



Get up.



What?



Fell asleep again.



Okay, just five more
minutes, please.



No.



Get out.



Come on.



Hey.



Late night?



I guess.



- Again?
- Yep, again.



Mmm.
Same guy?



Mmm.



- Do I know him?
- Maybe.



Do you know him?



- Good morning, everyone.
- 'Morning.



Talk to me, Lawrence.
What do we have for specials?



Lobster in a
white wine sauce.



- Mm-hmm. What else?
- Halibut with spinach and almonds.



- Mmm.
- Seafood linguini in a tomato sauce.



That looks good.



What was it, 25 no-shows
from last night's wedding?



Welcome back,
Mr. and Mrs. Evans.



So nice to see you again.
You remember Sophie.



She'll escort you to
your usual table.



- Have a lovely meal.
- Thank you.



Follow me.



Sylvia, table 6 needs
help with wine.



Okay, thank you.



- Good afternoon.
- Hi.



Vivi just told me you need
a wine recommendation.



Yeah, we're having
the petite filet.



Um, I would highly
recommend



the '87 Chateau Castés.
It's a beautiful Bordeaux.



Mmm.
I haven't heard of it.



Well, it's not on our list.



We have it on special
reserve down in the cellar.



But I think you'll
really enjoy it.



Thank you.
That would be fantastic.



- I'll be right back.
- Okay.



- Table 18 just ordered the check.
- Okay.



All right. I'll just have Vivi give
you a tour before she closes out.



I'm running out for a
quick cigarette, all right?



All right.



That was a great suggestion,
that Chateau Castés.



It's one of my favorites.



Yeah? Which white
would you recommend?



That would depend
on the meal.



It's okay. You can figure that
out when I buy you dinner.



Look,
I don't date customers.



This is where my dad and
that fucking slut burned.



How did the fire start?



The cops said they left
the gas on and it exploded.



- So it was an accident?
- Yeah.



That's what
the sheriff said.



They were fucking
when they died.



Their bodies got stuck together
'cause of the fire.



They had to use a knife
to cut them apart.



And who was the bitch?



Some married woman
from Maroma.



This is where they met...



halfway between both towns.



What the hell
are you doing?



What do you guess was going on through
Dad's head when he was burning?



Why'd you bring Xavier?



'Cause he's my friend.



We bury Dad tomorrow
and you're running a circus.



I ain't running
no circus, bitch.



Fuck you.



Hey, Mom,
Aunt Paula, Rebecca.



Did you fight with Cristobal?



No.



I don't want any
more fighting.



Now more than ever.



Okay.



Hey, that's my
dad's whiskey.



Is it?



When the hell is
he gonna drink it?



All I did was take care of him



and take care of his boys!



And this is what I get!



If that's what he did to me,
then you have to live with it



like I have to live with it!



He ruined my life!
Everywhere I go,



I have to look
at that thing!



I hate him!



I'm a good person!
I was a good wife!



<i>Santiago?</i>



- Excuse me.
- Cristobal?



Your mom ain't going
to the funeral.



Me and Rebecca,
we ain't going either.



Son of a bitch
doesn't deserve it.



He never did
anything to you.



Take care of everything,
both of you.



"... but deliver us from evil,



for Thine is the
kingdom in heaven,



forever and ever, amen. "



- Amen.
- Name of the Father and of the Son



and of the Holy Spirit, amen.



Amen.



Who are they?



Don't know.



And now we bid farewell



to our brother Nick Martinez.



I hope your father's
rotting in hell.



That wetback piece of shit took
away the best thing I ever had.



Hey, leave the boys alone.



Alone? It's their father's fault
that my kids lost their mom!



I hope you rot too.



- Where is the ranch?
- Finish it, buddy.



There's a job in Los Aztecas.



- Who wants to take it?
- I win!



How much are they
paying per hectare?



How much are they paying?
50 pesos.



There's 80 hectares.



We'll take it.



The pilot's on his way.



One two three four,
five six...



<i>Maria, come on!</i>



Coming!



<i>Maria, now!</i>



Hurry Maria,
your father's waiting.



See you later.



- It's a sorghum?
- Yeah, a sorghum field.



Hey, Daddy, what's up?



Hey, honey...



We got a job.



Can I stay
with my friends?



Sorry, sweetie,
we gotta go.



- Please?
- No, my dear.



- Come on, please.
- No.



- Come on, please, come on please.
- Stop it!



Stop it? Stop it?
You little whiner, get to work!



Hold this for me, whiner.



- You have the coordinates?
- Yeah. I just put them into the GPS.



That's the ranch.



- Morning.
- Good morning.



Santiago Martinez,
from Aero Fumigation.



Carlos Alarid.
Morning.



We need you to dust
this side of the ranch.



We've pulled all the workers out,
so it's all clear.



There's a stove in that shack,
and flour to make tortillas.



- Do you need anything else?
- No, thanks, we'll manage.



- See you later then.
- Hey, can I borrow your bicycle?



- Sure, no problem.
Thanks.



- So, who goes first?
- Let's flip fot it.



- Come on, you go first.
- Call it.



- Tails, always tails.
- Heads.



Come on, you go first.



- Hey, man, come on.
- O.K.



- You owe me one.
- I owe you two.



Be back in a minute.



Ahh!



What are you doing here?
Like you've never done this before?



I'm going to town
to buy cigarettes.



- O.K. I'll fix us something to eat.
- Good.



I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't get away.



Don't worry.



Can I get in?



Sure.



Hi.



Hi.



Not there.



Please.



Do you want us to leave it
for some other day?



No.



No, that's okay.



Listen...



my cousin lent me this place.
I've never been there.



But he tells me it's
far away from everything.



Do you want to go?



It ain't no Hilton.



I want cereal, Mariana.



I wanted them
over easy!



Well, that's too bad for you
'cause you got 'em well done.



Mariana, what's for dinner?



I can fix you and your friends
some cereal.



Hi, guys.



The supermarket
was packed.



Lines wrapped around
the aisles.



Did your daddy call?



Yeah. He's gonna come in
the day after tomorrow.



He's making a delivery
to Abilene.



That's okay.
I'll, I'll do it.



- Hey.
- Hey. Guess what?



Senator Parkes's
office just called.



He's coming in today for
lunch with a party of eight.



Shit. They can't call
a day ahead?



Lawrence?



We have the senator
coming in in two hours.



- He'll want the usual.
- Two hours?



Where does he expect
me to get everything?



Let me call Forrester at the
fish market, see what he can do.



Where were you
last night?



What?



Where were you
last night?



Home.



Who with?



You promised to never
ask any questions.



Who the fuck with?



We have work to do.



I'll be right back with another bottle.
Enjoy your meal.



Why is the senator's
wine glass empty?



Sorry, Sylvia.



The senator seemed pleased.



I'll say.
He left a $500 tip.



I think he wants us to vote
for him in his next election.



- You're unbelievable.
- No, I'm not.



That's what I want for
Christmas next year.



Remember that.



Have fun!



Sylvia, who the
hell is this guy?



Jesus Christ, John,
don't do this right now.



- He's just a friend, okay?
- He's a customer.



I saw him having lunch
here yesterday.



Yeah, yesterday.



Hey, what, do you just fuck
whoever you want to fuck,



and that's it?



When you leave your wife,
then you can talk.



Let's go.



- Jesus.
- I want to talk to you.



- Unlock the door.
- Hey.



- Come out and talk to me.
- Come on, leave her alone.



Fuck off.
Sylvia.



- What is your problem?
- I want to talk to you.



- My friend, leave her alone.
- I told you to fuck off.



- Didn't I?
- John!



Jesus Christ.
What are you, seven?



- What are you doing?
- I want to talk to you.



Oh, this is bullshit.
I'll leave you



to figure your shit out
with your boyfriend.



- He's not my boyfriend.
- What's wrong with you?



- What are you doing this for?
- Don't fucking touch me.



- Give me five minutes.
- What do you think,



- you can just fucking follow me?
- Hey, Sylvia.



You don't own me, John.
Do me a favor and fuck off.



I'll... let me
take you home.



- What do you want?
- Are you ok?



- Are you ok?
- I don't understand you!



Hey hey...



- I can drive you home.
- What?



I can drive you home.



Come on.
Hey. I'll take you home.



Come on.



What's your name?



My name's Carlos.



You?



Sylvia.



Sylvia?



Yeah, Sylvia.



Hi.



You know who I am?



I'm not here to fight.



Then what do you want?



I just want to know more,
that's all.



Who your mom was...



what she did with my dad.



We already know
what she did.



No, we don't.



Can I talk to
you someday?



Okay. I'll come
look for you then.



Daddy!



Daddy!



Daddy!



- Hey.
- Hey, darlin'.



I thought you didn't get
back until tomorrow.



Yeah,
but I wrapped up early.



- Mmm.
- Mmm.



- So where are the kids?
- They went to a baseball game.



You want to wait and
have lunch with them?



Yes.



I'll get cleaned up.



- Here, hon.
- Thanks, baby.



I'll have this working
in no time.



I have to go out
this evening.



Where?



To the Kmart
in Santa Elena.



I'll come with you.



Well, I have to pick up fabric
and go to the butcher's.



That's all right. I'll ride along.
I need to... buy me a radio.



- Whoa.
- Hey.



Hey.
Hi, guys.



- Working now.
- Daddy, Daddy!



I'm so happy
you're here!



- Yes!
- Ooh!



- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, little girl.



Come on, sweetheart,
hop in.



There you go.



Oh, I forgot my wallet.



I want the window!



Bobby, Monnie...
Bobby!



Bobby, she was there first.
Either sit down or get in the back.



- Put your seat belt on.
- It's not fair.



- Put your seat belt on.
- Kids, listen to your sister.



- I'm gonna go pee.
- This isn't even my seat belt.



I, I miss you too.



I'll try.
I'll try to get loose.



- Love you.
- Who're you talkin' to?



Your Aunt Leticia.
Come on, they're waiting for us.



- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.



Daddy, I want that one.



No, we're trying to
save up now, remember?



I need you to find these
things on the list.



And please help
Monnie find a blouse.



Could I have the keys? I want to
go pick up that fabric I ordered.



I want to
come with you.



You go with your sister and
find a blouse. I won't be long.



- Come on, baby.
- Dad, I'm gonna go over here.



Hi.



Hi.



There she is.



I'm sorry, guys.



The order wasn't ready
and they made me wait.



I gotta go back
and pick it up.



I've got to be able to make Monnie's
dress for the school presentation.



Did you get everything
on the list?



- Mariana?
- Could you open the back, honey?



Oh, sure.



- Give me the keys.
- Okay, guys.



You okay?



You want to come in?



Come in?



Yes, come in.



Um...



Okay.



Do you want
something to drink?



Drink?
No. No drink.



I'm gonna change.
I'm freezing.



Sure you don't want some?



No.



Why?



You don't like me?



What are you doing?



If my dad finds out you're here,
he's gonna kill you.



I told you I'd
come look for you.



Yeah, but not here.



Wait for me at the windmill,
on the way to Guadalupe.



Okay.



Why do you want
to see me?



I don't know.



I don't think it's okay
for you to talk to me.



Why?



Do you look like
your mom?



No.
Do you look like your dad?



A little.



Do you know how your mom
and my dad met?



No, I have no idea.



Hand it over.



I got it.



You like hunting?



A lot. A boyfriend
used to take me,



but I haven't gone back
since we broke up.



My dad taught me
how to hunt.



Did you love your dad?



Yeah.



I loved my mom too, but,
I didn't like her.



Do you have any pictures?



You don't look
like him at all.



It's done.
Take it off.



I can't.
It's too hot.



Doesn't that burn?



Here, sweetie.



- No, thanks. - Just have a little.
You haven't had anything all day.



- Are you Carlos Alarid?
- Yes.



The patient has asked
to speak to you.



He asked just for him.



Wait for me,
I'll be right back.



Let's go.



I don't have time to argue.
Please, come on.



I need you to pack a suitcase with
enough clothes to last a week.



I'm not going anywhere.



- I don't want to meet that woman.
- Just pack your bag and take a bath.



- And if I don't want to?
- She's your mother.



- My mother? I've never seen her!
- You're coming with me, ok?



- Fuck, I don't want to!
- Where did you learn to talk like that?



Ever hear your father curse like that?
Take a bath and pack your stuff.



- You're getting on that plane
whether you like it or not. - No!



How do you like it?



It's cold.



There you go. The room
will warm up in a bit.



Did you meet my mother?



I met your dad after she left.



Why did she leave us?



I don't know.



Your dad tried to find
her several times.



He just recently found
out where she lives.



- I don't want to meet her. Let's go back.
- Don't start, please.



Your father asked
me to find her.



And we are going to find her.



Hi.



Wow.
Look at this place.



Ha!



You make me so happy.



And I'd be even happier if we
could have some hot water



so I could take a shower.



You taste better this way.



No, no.



Please not, not there.



Why?



Because I don't like
that part of my body.



And how do you know
I'm not gonna like it?



I had cancer
two years ago.



Hey.



Where were you?



I was at Libby's.



Bobby cut his arm
with a piece of glass.



Dr. Page had to
sew him up.



- Is he okay?
- He's fine.



He wouldn't stop crying
and asking for you.



- Y'all be good now.
- Bye!



I forgot my homework.
Keep going.



- I'll catch up with you later.
- We'll wait for you.



No, go on.



- Hi.
- Hi.



Now we are finally
getting some hot water.



- Can I help you?
- That's okay.



Almost there.



- Is it working?
- That's it.



What are you doing?



What do you want?



We have to talk, Mariana.



You have the wrong girl.
My name is Sylvia. Okay?



Santiago sent me
to look for you.



What did you just say?



Santiago...



...sent me to look for you.



Mariana,
this is your daughter.



Her name is Maria.



Stay away from me.



This is my mom and dad
with us when we were little.



You look like Betty
from "Archie. "



This is my mother's
last picture.



It was her birthday.



And this is me.



Can I have this one?



Only if you give me a scar.



What?



I want to
remember this day.



Will you give me one?



Come get me tonight.



My dad's away
on business.



We can go to the desert
and burn chollas.



My grandfather told
me that the smoke



of a burnt cholla
is purifying.



They burn like fireworks.



Yeah.
I love it.



Roll up your sleeves.



What for?



So you can give
me your scar.



Shit.



It burns.



Stop it.
You're gonna hurt yourself.



This is for you.



Good night.



Let me sleep with you.



Are you crazy?



I swear, I won't
lay a finger on you.



You're gonna wake up
my sister Monnie.



You said your dad's
not home.



We could sleep
in his room.



What did your mom
wear to bed?



A slip.



Can you put it on?



I'm wearing my
father's shirt.



You promise not
to touch me?



I promise.



Does your burn hurt?



No.



Mine hurts a lot.



You promised you
wouldn't touch me.



Do you want me to go?



No.



Sylvia,
Mr. Drummond called.



He's bringing a big
party of eight.



- And we're booked.
- I know.



What do you want
me to do, Sophie?



Are you okay?



Just take care of things
for a while. I'll be back.



Hi.



Can you come outside?



We need to talk.



What's up?



Do you like me?



I mean...



do you think you
could love me?



I don't know.
I guess so.



Let's just
get out of here.



Just me and you, today.



What are you
talking about?



Let's just pack your car up
and we'll go somewhere new



and start over. Somewhere,
anywhere but here. Just, let's go.



- You know, I don't understand...
- Yes or no.



I don't know.
I gotta think about it.



Mariana.



Mariana!



I can certainly
sympathize with him.



I've had a weight
problem my entire life.



Of course I've always
liked to eat...



Hiya, everybody.



Hi, Mom.



You had dinner?



No, we were
waiting for you.



I'll go get it started.



Why are you so late?



Honey, you scared me.



What did you do today?



I went to pick up
some fabric



and then I went
to Libby's.



I also went to Libby's.
I didn't see you there.



Well, maybe you weren't
there when I was there.



I was there since 4:00.



Stop asking questions



and help me
clean up this mess.



Nick?
Hey, it's Gina.



I need to talk to you.



No, not at the trailer.



Um, the supermarket?



Say, 11:00?



Okay, bye.



I love you. You love me.
I don't know if it's right,



but it's real.
Do you want to let it go?



Nick, please
just understand.



Answer me.
Do you want to let it go?



I don't want to
see you anymore.



Forever?



I can't keep seeing you.



I'm gonna wait for you at
the trailer every day at noon



until you come back.



- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.



I've got a surprise.



What's this?



Well, we haven't had a picnic in
a long time, so I just thought...



On the patio?
It's kind of cold out here, honey.



- Is there anything for Stripes?
- Stripes can have a cookie.



- Okay.
- Can I have a cookie?



No, not until you've
had your lunch.



I'll do the burgers.



- Is mine ready?
- No, not yet.



Hey, guys,
come join us.



- Hey, kids.
- Why are we having a party?



It's not a party.
It's just a picnic...



just for fun.



- I have homework to do.
- Oh, come on.



Don't you want to roast
some marshmallows?



I'm not a kid, Mom.



Mariana, how about you?
Just for a little bit.



I have to go to Carrie's house
to work on a school project.



- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, sweetie.



I can't.



I just can't.



I'm sorry.



You may want to brush up on the
newest traffic laws in Oregon...



Coming.



Hey.



Are you okay?



They haven't
been here either.



- I think we should check
The Palms. - No.



We're never gonna find them.
They're gone.



Believe me, a Mexican
and a 12-year-old girl



are pretty hard to hide.



We're gonna find her.



We just need to
keep looking.



When was the last
time you saw her?



I left her two days
after she was born.



Why?



I didn't deserve her.



Teachers must
really like you!



- Hey, hon.
- Hey.



- There's somebody here
to see you. - Hi.



Hey, you never told
us about Mariana.



She's a friend from school.



You want to
stay for lunch?



No, thanks.



No, we're gonna grab
lunch somewhere else.



All right, well, we're gonna
have lunch at Paula's.



Yeah.



- It's very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.



- See you later.
- Bye.



Have fun.



See you.



What are you doing here?



I wanted to see
your parents' room.



It's this way.



Did your mom and
dad get along?



So-so.



Come here.



Still hurt?



No.



With a little girl?
You're sure?



Thank you.



They're in room 51.



- What?
- 51.



What do you want?



- I want to see my daughter.
- I don't understand.



- Her hija, her daughter. - Eh?
- I don't want to see her!



- She doesn't want to see you.
- Tell her to go away!



- You left us standing in the street.
Now fuck off! - Maria!



Don't worry.
We'll figure something out.



Hey.



Hey!



Maria?



Please, just let me talk
to you for a second.



- What the fuck do you want?
- No, just...



- What the fuck do you want?
- I am begging you, please, just...



- Leave her in peace! - Please...
- Fuck you "please"!



- Carlos?
- What?



Leave her.



Are you sure, sweetie?



Can I sit down?



I'm really sorry I ran away
like that yesterday.



I didn't...



You just...



Maria, do you
speak English?



You're all grown up.



I think about you
all the time...



especially on
your birthdays.



I try to imagine
what you look like.



You're so beautiful.



You look just
like your father.



My dad's in the hospital.



Why?



His plane crashed.



Is he okay?



I don't know.



He's a pilot?



He's a crop duster.



You didn't know?



Is everything fine?



Your father asked me to bring
her back to Mexico with us.



Do you want her to come?



Alright.



'And may You take care
of us and everyone else'.



Amen.



Okay, hop in.



Have you said
your prayers?



I don't pray anymore.



That's wrong, Mariana.



Lots of things
are wrong, Mom,



and they can't be
fixed by praying.



You've been acting
so strange lately.



Tomorrow I want you to tell
me what's on your mind.



- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Mom.



Good night.



The girl you brought
home the other day...



...it was her daughter?



Yes.



Are you fucking her?



Why are you doing this?



It's none of your business.



- Can't be doing this shit to your mom.
- Stay out of this.



It's not enough what
already happened?



It's got nothing
to do with you.



You're gonna stop
seeing her.



You understand?



Do you understand?



Do you enjoy
betraying your family?



I'm talking to you,
you son of a bitch.



- I didn't betray anyone.
- You are worse than your father.



You dared to
bring her home?



You're going to be
buried in hell with him.



I'm sorry.



Get out of here!



Ahh!



What happened?



Tell me this ain't true.



This...
tell me this is a lie.



Did you actually
sleep with him?



Santiago, my dad is on
his way to get you.



Go now, and come get me.



What grade are you in?



In eighth grade.



Do you have a boyfriend?



No.



Do you?



I don't have a boyfriend.



Jose Sanchez Martinez.



I want to have plastic
surgery on my breast.



Don't do it.
I love how you look.



The scar is so ugly.



You beat death.
You fought and won.



That makes your
scar beautiful.



Don't erase it.



Get out, Mom.



Get out, Mom, get out, Mom,
get out, Mom, get out...



Mom!



- Is it alright if the girl hears this?
- Yes, it's her father.



We have to operate.
There have been complications...



...and if the infection is
worse than we think...



...we might have to
amputate his leg.



May we see him?



You can see him,
but he's sedated.



Hey, Daddy.



Don't get too close.



He's going to be okay, right?



Yeah, he's gonna be fine.



I love you, Daddy.



No...



You can't be in here,
you have to leave.



Let's go.



Maria, let's go.
It's time.



Come on.



Can I...



can I just stay
for a little longer?



What did she say?



She's his wife,
I think she wants to stay.



Two minutes.



Santiago?



It's me...



Mariana.



You're not gonna die,
are you?



'Cause if you die, I wouldn't
know what to do with her.



I can barely look
her in the eyes.



She needs you.



And I need you.



I'm so scared.



I've been living scared of
myself and now I can't...



I can't run away anymore.



I killed them.



I killed your father
and my mother.



I didn't mean to, but...



now I can't get the smell
of them burning...



I can't get rid of it.



Why did you want me
to come back here?



Why?



Why?



Mariana, where
are you going?



- What the hell are you doing?
- Just let me go!



I'm gonna tell Dad.



Tell him whatever you want.



You know, you can sleep in your room.
I'll sleep out here.



No, it's okay.



What happened?



Nothing, I just
burned myself once.



My dad has the same scar
in the same place.



He says he did it
to never forget you.



So did I.



I have a scar too.



What happened?



I fell when I was three.



Are you gonna
stay with us?



I don't know.
I have to talk to him.



You know, it's been
a long time and...



You're leaving again,
aren't you?



I'm tired.



Good night.



Good night.



Where are we?



That's Mexico.



What are we gonna
do over there?



Live in peace.



I'll never have peace again.



I'm pregnant.



- What?
- I'm pregnant and I don't want it.



We can live in Mexico...
the three of us.



No, I can't.
I can't have it.



Can I talk to you
for a minute?



Maria...



...do you think you
can forgive me for not...



...for not being here
all these years?



I left you because I was
scared that you'd be like me...



...that you'd come
out like me.



Do you think you
can forgive me?



Please?



I want to go
see my dad now.



- Good day. - Good day, Doctor.
How did the operation go?



We were able to clean the infection,
and we pinned the bone.



- Did he lose the leg?
- No, he didn't.



We still have to see how things go,
but he's doing pretty well.



- May I see him?
- Yes, you can see him.



My dad's gonna be okay.



Are you coming?
