1
00:00:01,882 --> 00:00:04,350
That will cost you money.

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:08,288
Ladies and gentlemen...

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,955
...you'll have to pay up...

4
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:17,894
... if you want me to sing the
ballad of Francisco Manoel...

5
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:22,601
...the bandit of Cobra Verde...

6
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:25,796
...the poorest of the poor...

7
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:29,741
...the master of the slaves...

8
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:36,513
It was he who became the Viceroy.

9
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:41,282
It was he who was the
Alonest of the alone.

10
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:50,095
Francisco Manoel's mother sighs,

11
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:52,563
Francisco, I feel only
aches and dread.

12
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,566
Francisco Manoel's mother cries

13
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:57,159
Francisco, leave me.
I will soon be dead.

14
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:02,240
Eleven years of drought,
the rocks are sick.

15
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:06,244
The world is dying.
Evil is a trick.

16
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:24,863
I will die now. Be quiet, or the
bench will crack from sadness.

17
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:26,489
Do not move. Stay still.

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,330
The water, the earth
and the sun turn black.

19
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:32,371
God in His Perplexity,
pretends it's His Will.

20
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:36,638
Francisco, traveling,
reads a line in the sky.

21
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:39,109
''Don't set your eyes
on the salt sea shore.

22
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:41,646
Don't reason. Don't argue.
Don't ask us why.

23
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:44,546
Fate will send you a lover,
and one friend more.''

24
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:55,854
Based on the novel '' The Viceroy
of Ouidah'' by Bruce Chatwin

25
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:10,059
His Royal Highness
Nana Agyefi Kwamell of Nsein

26
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,812
and with the girls of the
Zigi Cultural Troupe Ho Ziavi

27
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:39,911
Where's my money?!

28
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:46,756
Where's my money?! Where are my
partners?! Where's my money?!

29
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:55,759
Keep moving! Next?

30
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:58,633
What the hell are you doing here?
There's no money for you!

31
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,035
What? No! I can't believe it!

32
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,937
You know you don't get
any wages this week.

33
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:05,569
The bank kept it all! Get out!

34
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,511
There's no place here
for blood suckers.

35
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,913
You bastard! You cheated me!

36
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:18,780
I want you awake when you die!

37
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:42,009
It's Cobra Verde, the bandit!
Get the children in a safe place!

38
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,957
Go on, get it into the church!

39
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:45,231
That rifle stays outside!

40
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:50,106
Now, get that thing out of here,
or I'll throw you out!

41
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:08,051
I want something to eat! Tell
your parents Cobra Verde is here!

42
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:14,327
I have no parents! This is my bar,
and you don't frighten me!

43
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,640
My name is Francisco Manoel.

44
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:29,542
And my name is Euclides...

45
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:35,815
Euclides Alves da Silva
Pernambucano Wandereley.

46
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:39,687
I'm a da Silva too.

47
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:45,531
It's only my chest and shoulders
that are crooked - at night...

48
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:49,295
I always dream I have to carry a
whole mountain range on my back.

49
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:55,005
You stand straighter than
the whole town!

50
00:09:56,009 --> 00:10:00,469
- I'm hungry.
- I'll bring you some food.

51
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:26,069
How do you know all these things?

52
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:31,105
From our priest, and he
learned them from our Bishop.

53
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:34,678
And where does
the snow come from?

54
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:37,379
You'll see it out there!

55
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:40,646
There's always snow on the moon!

56
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:43,688
That's why it's always white!
White and cold.

57
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:46,451
You have to look very carefully.

58
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,759
Why is that?

59
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:54,597
It's because the moon...
takes the water out of the ocean.

60
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,066
And when night falls...

61
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:59,605
the tips of the mountains
attract the snowflakes.

62
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:04,336
But only as much salt
as we have in our tears.

63
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,072
And here on earth?

64
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:12,515
It's very far away -
you must keep going west.

65
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:16,951
Four years in horseback...
and ten on foot.

66
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:20,492
And after that,
there are high mountains.

67
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:24,586
They rise higher and higher -
right over the clouds.

68
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:28,133
And then above the clouds,
then you find the snow.

69
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,794
It only falls in the night-time.

70
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:37,706
Just like feathers. But it only falls...
from above the clouds.

71
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:42,571
And then the whole world
turns light as feather -

72
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,349
and snow white!

73
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:52,647
Even the lions turn white...
and the eagles...

74
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,022
the rabbits get a snowy coat...

75
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:58,564
and all the animals
in the world turn white!

76
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,331
And when you're walking
through the snow...

77
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:07,565
your feet don't weigh anything at all.

78
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:12,939
And the little snowflakes,
go flying up in the air...

79
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,704
just like feathers.

80
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:32,027
In a year or so,
I'm going to sell this bar.

81
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:36,227
And then go west,
and climb up the mountains.

82
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,641
I'm going east to the sea.

83
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:47,303
The Sertao dries our hearts,
and kills the cattle.

84
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:51,611
You'd better be very careful
when you go to the sea...

85
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:54,049
it's where the tempests are born...

86
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:56,280
and the snowflakes
have their cradle.

87
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:59,722
That's what the reverend father said!

88
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:24,712
I never had a friend in all my life...

89
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:28,847
Farewell.

90
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,139
Your money or your life!

91
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:36,144
My life.

92
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:58,596
Every day... you walk forty miles
through the thorns...

93
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:03,403
And why are you barefoot?
Don't you have any shoes?

94
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:07,478
I don't trust shoes.

95
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,572
And why don't you have a horse?

96
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:16,948
I'd never trust a horse.
And I don't trust people either.

97
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:22,125
But I long to go forth
from here to another world.

98
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:26,651
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

99
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:40,628
Don't run away.
It'll only be worse for you.

100
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,601
Let him go!

101
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:50,044
He can find the post by himself!

102
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:34,651
Hey, you with the bare feet.
What's your name?

103
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:42,396
Da Silva...
Francisco Manoel da Silva.

104
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:48,298
I am Colonel Octavio Cotinho.
I need a man like you.

105
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:51,240
I have six hundred slaves
in my sugar fields...

106
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:53,811
and my overseer is an idiot.

107
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:59,007
No one... grows more sugar than I do.

108
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:42,222
Now, if that's not enough,
you can always ask for more.

109
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:44,319
I've never had
this many clothes before.

110
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,196
You know, when I think there
are still some fields not planted...

111
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:50,325
with my sugar cane.

112
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:54,432
It makes me even madder
to think there are meadows...

113
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:57,940
where my cattle aren't grazing!

114
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:05,115
And when I think of
all the mulatto girls...

115
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:08,448
I haven't made pregnant yet, why,
that's quite beyond endurance.

116
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:11,717
Better watch out for the ladies,
my friend!

117
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:14,355
And when do I start work?

118
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,191
Oh, there's no hurry.
I'll show you everything.

119
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,987
You'll be the overseer here.

120
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:50,084
We harvest twice a year,
it's that fertile.

121
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:53,096
I've got another forty sugar
plantations just like this one.

122
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,293
I alone produce more sugar than
the whole state of Pernambuco.

123
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:01,635
A hundred thousand tons per year.

124
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:05,069
And all of it goes to England,
our enemy.

125
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:09,546
They've abolished the slave trade.
They seize our ships.

126
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:12,116
And yet, without us they
wouldn't have any sugar.

127
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:13,946
And the way they buy the sugar...

128
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:16,578
you'd think our rivers were
overflowing with the stuff.

129
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,122
Hah, it's grotesque.

130
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:21,291
You'll be in charge here, too.

131
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:24,125
This is where we squeeze
out the sugar cane...

132
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:25,992
and this is where
the juice is thickened.

133
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,862
We heat the molasses up to
a hundred and twenty degrees.

134
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:31,528
At this stage it's still a thin syrup.

135
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:36,165
In a couple of hours the
molasses will start to crystallize.

136
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:40,471
This is no easy task - every now
and then one of the workers...

137
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,012
collapses from the fumes.

138
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:43,809
But we've got enough of them.

139
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,579
As you see here we're ladling it
from one tub to another.

140
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:32,328
Don't run away.
Get a machete. Hurry!

141
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:42,031
We're going to have to
hack another arm off!

142
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:44,275
Is there nothing we can do?

143
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:46,708
Oh, this sort of thing
happens all the time.

144
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:12,201
How very strange. I haven't bred
any children yet today.

145
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:14,670
Come on. Come on then!

146
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:30,304
Hey, Francisco Manoel...
don't your shoes fit?

147
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:46,954
Tell me, did you ever learn
how to use a knife and fork?

148
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:09,516
The man from Santao doesn't
talk to just anyone!

149
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:11,987
How many cows did you own?

150
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:35,763
I have nothing to lose.
I don't have to talk to anybody!

151
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:30,953
I'll kill the lot of you!
My daughters are all whores.

152
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:34,464
Rutting with a barefoot cowherd!
Bonita you whore!

153
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:40,436
Bonita! Bonita! You filthy
little bitch! Bonita pregnant!

154
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:42,666
My little Bonita pregnant!

155
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:46,835
Wandeleide! Only fifteen years old
and she's pregnant!

156
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:51,575
Valkyria! Valkyria! Valkyria!

157
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:55,210
Valkyria, look me in the eye
and tell me the truth!

158
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,049
Are you pregnant too? Well!

159
00:27:57,155 --> 00:28:00,750
No, I mean yes.
Daddy, I don't know!

160
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:07,765
Cowherd! Bastard! You!!!
What have you got to say for yourself!

161
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:16,701
Sugarcane planter.
I am the bandit Cobra Verde.

162
00:28:23,815 --> 00:28:27,182
An outlaw in my own house!

163
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:33,556
A thief, a bandit, a criminal!

164
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,493
Let's put him on trial.

165
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:38,827
Just kill him.

166
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,228
The man's too dangerous.

167
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:46,202
We'd have three or four dead
before we finished him off.

168
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:49,668
Why not marry him off to
one of your daughters?

169
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:53,006
After all, isn't he the best man
on your plantation?

170
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:55,002
I'd have done that...

171
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:58,139
if the swine hadn't made
all three of them pregnant.

172
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,616
Send him to Africa to buy slaves.

173
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,584
What do you mean : ''buy slaves''?

174
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:05,485
We haven't had a slave from
Africa in the last ten years.

175
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,581
That's just the point.

176
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:13,023
We send him to a certain death.

177
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:15,463
The King of Dahomey is mad.

178
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:19,298
Anyone who sets foot on
his territory is killed on the spot!

179
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:22,931
Not one single white man has
come back alive from there...

180
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,134
in the last ten years.

181
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:31,573
And what if... and what if
the scum does manage it!

182
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:34,342
He'll never make it. I know Africa.

183
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:35,647
I know the Bight of Benin.

184
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:39,315
And if he does make it,
he'll bring back so many slaves...

185
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:42,689
you can extend your plantations
all the way to Sergipe.

186
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:46,322
Why don't you give him your
oldest daughter to marry?

187
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:49,229
Yes! Use him any way you can.

188
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:54,130
And as for the other two girls...
well, surely you can find...

189
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:56,867
some sort of husband for them.

190
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:58,772
If that doesn't appeal to you...

191
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:02,176
send them to the Carmelite Sisters.
The choice is yours.

192
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:04,813
I'll kill that pig!

193
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:08,215
I'll arrange everything
with my friend the governor.

194
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:21,559
Da Silva... we have
a special assignment...

195
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,726
which we can entrust
only to a capable man.

196
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:32,844
This is an official certificate
entitling you to practice...

197
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:33,933
the slave trade.

198
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,809
As you know, this trade
has fallen into stagnation.

199
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:39,440
The King of Dahomey
has cut off our supplies...

200
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,883
but we know he needs
weapons and money.

201
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:44,351
So, we propose the following :...

202
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:48,586
we will send you to our
Fort Elmina in Dahomey.

203
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:51,959
You will have rank as a lieutenant.

204
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:55,032
Your wages will be held for you
here in a special bank account...

205
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:56,157
in Bahia.

206
00:30:56,268 --> 00:31:00,637
In five months' time, a ship with
a cargo of munitions will arrive.

207
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:02,740
You can pay the king with that.

208
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:05,139
We've also thought about Angola...

209
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:07,837
but the English Navy
have it blockaded.

210
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,081
Sailing around the Cape to
the east coast of Africa...

211
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:14,414
is impossible because the Arabs
monopolize the slave trade...

212
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,487
from Zanzibar on down.

213
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:20,286
The situation looks very
promising at this time...

214
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:24,419
because the King of Dahomey
is involved in a war with the Egbas.

215
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:28,488
And that means that he needs us
just as much as we need him.

216
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:31,930
When did you last
receive information?

217
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:36,337
It's been a long time since
we received any messages.

218
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:40,207
And we can't trust those
reports that we do get.

219
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:41,972
Will you accept our offer?

220
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:48,441
Yes.

221
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,153
Congratulations.

222
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:58,557
Here's your commission,
and the best of luck to you.

223
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:07,169
We've got a ship to outfit
for a long ocean journey.

224
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:16,878
Elmina, West Africa

225
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:21,709
Brazilian slave fortress...

226
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,189
in the country of the sinister,
demented King of Dahomey

227
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:44,206
Put me ashore - and give me
ten rifles to take along.

228
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,239
None of my crew would dare take you.

229
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:51,577
I can't force them.
We'll just have to wait...

230
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:53,981
... and see if the Africans
will come and fetch you.

231
00:32:54,085 --> 00:33:00,456
Nobody there - what's the matter.
Here, take the telescope.

232
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:02,788
The fort seems dead to the world.

233
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:13,562
Usually they send out
one of their fetish priests...

234
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:16,740
praying for us to capsize in the surf.

235
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:20,242
All flotsam is the property of the king.

236
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:25,282
I've even seen them strip
a half-drowned sailor naked.

237
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,351
We'll just have to wait
and see what happens.

238
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:29,386
Thus far, Africa's quite
a disappointment.

239
00:36:17,188 --> 00:36:19,816
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

240
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:25,286
Where is the barge full of silk?
And the coach and the horses?

241
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:30,723
What about the trumpets? And
what about the silver hunting rifles?

242
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:33,423
There will be no gifts.

243
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:35,730
Not even greyhounds?

244
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:40,099
Not even greyhounds.

245
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:43,699
There will be no gifts until your
king resumes the slave trade.

246
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,605
And turns over the fort to me.

247
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,045
Give me one of those rifles!

248
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:57,783
I'll make payment with rifles.

249
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:02,754
The powder we have here
takes a long time to speak -

250
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,055
- yours speaks at once.
- Keep it then.

251
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,765
Death to the white men!
Death to the white men!

252
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:49,537
You can live here if you like.

253
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:52,439
The west wing's in
reasonable condition.

254
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:58,471
And... you can help yourself
to one of my daughters.

255
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:02,041
She could... She could
live in the castle with you.

256
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:04,617
Are you running a brothel, or what?

257
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:07,520
No. I mean I'm doing this for free.

258
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:10,193
I need something to live on after all...

259
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:12,660
but I only do this for white men.

260
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:16,757
And you're the first one
who's come here... for a long time.

261
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,831
Mother of Jesus Christ and all
the saints be praised!

262
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:33,329
I am Taparica, the drum major...

263
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:35,496
the only survivor of the garrison.

264
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:37,335
I'm a free Yoruba...

265
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:40,342
and I served in the First Regiment
of the Black Militia.

266
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:43,072
Shall I show you where I live?

267
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:55,088
This is my home...

268
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:58,854
and these are
my brothers and sisters.

269
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:19,772
What happened here?

270
00:42:20,785 --> 00:42:23,345
It all started very strangely.

271
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:27,012
They say the king in Abomey
is a little soft in the head.

272
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:29,686
He found slavery
to be a bad idea.

273
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:31,489
Instead of sending us slaves...

274
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:34,895
one day he sent us a
horse with only one ear.

275
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:36,694
Then they attacked us.

276
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:41,030
The governor was killed outright
in a skirmish on the coast.

277
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:44,471
Then they overran the fort
and plundered everything.

278
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:48,033
The Black Militia ran away, and
all the whites were murdered.

279
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:50,113
The skulls of the prisoners...

280
00:42:50,214 --> 00:42:52,842
are now decorating the walls
of the Palace in Abomey.

281
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,316
They looted everything,
stole the bells...

282
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:59,788
and poked the eyes out of all the
portraits in the main building.

283
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:04,756
Then... they broke open the
rum barrels one by one...

284
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:06,523
and drank the lot!

285
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:10,122
They grabbed a cadet and
raped him in the courtyard.

286
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:20,276
They put ants on my chest...
pepper under my eyelids.

287
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:24,542
They burnt my tongue because they
claimed we were hiding a treasure.

288
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:28,107
They were just about to do their
worst when someone exploded...

289
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:30,517
the powder magazine with
a lighted torch.

290
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:34,620
They took seven corpses
from the wreckage...

291
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:37,489
... and after that
they left me in peace.

292
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:47,061
We do not know
who is buried where...

293
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:54,796
but I think this grave here
is the Governor's.

294
00:44:57,408 --> 00:44:59,535
Why did you come...

295
00:45:01,912 --> 00:45:05,575
all alone... without any soldiers?

296
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:09,277
Aren't you afraid...?
Aren't you afraid of dying...?

297
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:11,082
I never tried it.

298
00:45:31,776 --> 00:45:33,641
What do we do now?

299
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:41,442
We wait.

300
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:06,120
Careful with that! Keep it up.

301
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:14,133
I've never seen a
white man work before!

302
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:23,905
Get out of my way!
I've got to hold up the front!

303
00:50:35,279 --> 00:50:36,803
Spiritus sanctus...

304
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:41,573
sanctus...

305
00:50:41,685 --> 00:50:43,778
Come on, let me through here...!

306
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:47,318
You filthy pig! I don't want to
see you here anymore.

307
00:50:47,424 --> 00:50:49,483
Get out, and stay out!

308
00:51:28,198 --> 00:51:31,258
Only three hundred slaves?
That doesn't make full use...

309
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:34,599
of the hold capacity, but
it's better than nothing.

310
00:51:35,205 --> 00:51:38,299
Our friends in Brazil will be surprised.

311
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:41,567
Of course twenty per cent of
the sales price will be paid...

312
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:43,407
into your bank account.

313
00:51:54,258 --> 00:51:55,748
Have you got any firearms?

314
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:57,656
One hundred and forty
with ammunition.

315
00:51:57,761 --> 00:51:58,750
Silk?

316
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:00,853
Five bales. lt isn't the best quality...

317
00:52:00,964 --> 00:52:02,795
but here they don't
know the difference.

318
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,924
Rum?

319
00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:05,467
Ten barrels.

320
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:08,637
How about tobacco?

321
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:13,039
Unfortunately it got damp and
we had to throw it overboard.

322
00:52:18,615 --> 00:52:22,312
Next time you'll have to bring...
more firearms.

323
00:52:23,053 --> 00:52:26,989
Has that war with the Egbas
flared up again?

324
00:52:30,761 --> 00:52:34,424
The information that
gets here is... incomplete...

325
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:36,692
We have to rely on guess-work.

326
00:52:39,837 --> 00:52:42,431
May I make a... personal remark.

327
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:43,870
Go ahead.

328
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:48,469
We tried to... if I might say so...

329
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:52,572
consider all the possibilities
when we sent you down here.

330
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:57,817
But we never expected...
to see you again...

331
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:01,848
Why do you suppose
they're sending you slaves?

332
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,424
I suppose they need me.

333
00:53:41,832 --> 00:53:45,529
You can best guess their age...
from their teeth.

334
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:02,082
Actually they're lucky.
We're saving their lives.

335
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:04,585
During their annual ceremonies,
their customs would have

336
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:06,952
them sacrificed to the king's
ancestors as messengers.

337
00:54:07,057 --> 00:54:09,457
They'd be dispatched
to the other world.

338
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,621
But now we are sending
them to a wonderful land...

339
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,131
where the cigars grow on trees
and everyone dances.

340
00:54:28,812 --> 00:54:30,575
Find out what's going on!

341
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:52,467
It is Bossa. Bossa Gelele.
He's the king's older brother.

342
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:56,027
All men and children with the
first name Bossa are to be killed.

343
00:54:56,139 --> 00:54:58,972
The king can't stand to have
anyone else in his domain...

344
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:00,475
with his first name, Bossa.

345
00:55:00,577 --> 00:55:03,273
His name is Bossa, Bossa Ahadee.

346
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:06,948
He knows customs won't allow
him to kill his own brother...

347
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,745
of the solid soil of his kingdom.

348
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:12,253
That's why he's being taken out
to the sea to be drowned.

349
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:30,795
White man, when the king searches
for someone, he can't hide.

350
00:56:31,234 --> 00:56:33,828
Even if he flees beneath the earth...

351
00:56:34,004 --> 00:56:35,869
the ground will talk!

352
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:45,243
The leopard has begotten
a son with a female human.

353
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:47,310
The leopards mighty claw...

354
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:50,750
has left an indelible mark
on the child's temples.

355
00:56:50,887 --> 00:56:53,355
Now the holy... Leopard's son...

356
00:56:53,457 --> 00:56:56,426
declares that he
loves the white man.

357
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:59,084
Is the white man in good health?

358
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:03,066
The new white man
comes from across the sea.

359
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:05,401
He has seen many things.

360
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:08,962
The king has prepared a
king's road for him.

361
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:11,632
The king wishes to see the stranger.

362
00:57:16,747 --> 00:57:20,581
The king has dictated this message
for you to his royal scribe.

363
00:57:24,788 --> 00:57:26,050
I am Portuguese...

364
00:57:26,156 --> 00:57:28,989
held captive by this horrible king
these last sixteen years.

365
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:31,151
He does not know I am
writing this. Beware!

366
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:34,230
If you come here, you're a dead man.

367
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:38,661
Tell his majesty... I must always
have one foot in the sea...

368
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:40,393
I cannot come.

369
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,901
Seize him.

370
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:34,408
Abomey
Residence of the King

371
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:31,091
I wish I had your skin.

372
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:34,861
The black people believe
the Devil is white.

373
01:04:45,962 --> 01:04:48,089
The leopard has risen.

374
01:04:50,433 --> 01:04:52,560
The leopard takes his seat.

375
01:04:55,405 --> 01:05:00,035
Dada, breathe for me! Dada, steal
from me. Dada, break my bones.

376
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:05,203
Take me! My head is yours.
My body is yours. Take me.

377
01:05:05,715 --> 01:05:10,209
It's yours. I'm all yours.
Dada! Please!

378
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:15,983
The bush king takes his seat.

379
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:28,527
What does that mean?

380
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:35,443
That is the bush king.
He doesn't exist.

381
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:38,343
That is, he only exists
in the king's imagination.

382
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:40,609
But the two kings rule together.

383
01:05:43,753 --> 01:05:45,448
The leopard speaks!

384
01:05:46,189 --> 01:05:50,216
For the annual ceremony
all dogs must be slaughtered -

385
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:53,359
the preceding night
at the Gate of Tears.

386
01:05:53,463 --> 01:05:57,991
The dogs assemble in the streets,
and try to talk like humans.

387
01:05:58,101 --> 01:06:02,970
But if they succeed, it will
bring a plague upon the people.

388
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:23,048
We must conquer the Egbas!

389
01:06:29,999 --> 01:06:32,467
We shall break Abeokuta!

390
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:39,700
My house needs thatching!

391
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:48,344
I'll thatch my roof with
the skulls of my enemies.

392
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:14,573
How are my brethren?
Answer, white man before I kill you!

393
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:22,181
How is the health
of the King of Prussia?

394
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:31,787
How is my brother,
the Tsar of Russia?

395
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:40,565
And how is Queen Victoria,
whose heart is a big calabash...

396
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:44,663
overflowing with palm wine
for the thirsty man?

397
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:49,944
I can't hear what you said...

398
01:07:50,046 --> 01:07:52,241
I can't hear you.

399
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:15,899
Prepare for your death, stranger.
Time doesn't occur to the king.

400
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,437
The Devil is white. Death is white!
All whites are half dead.

401
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:14,189
That's what they always do before
they behead a white man.

402
01:09:19,936 --> 01:09:22,564
They have painted your face black...

403
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:26,637
because they are not
allowed to kill a white man.

404
01:09:28,177 --> 01:09:30,270
I'm not afraid of you.

405
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:38,744
In this place, the dead are
more alive than the living.

406
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:48,253
No one may see the leopard
while he drinks.

407
01:09:59,542 --> 01:10:05,742
Hey, white man. One day
I will drink from your skull!

408
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:11,747
This was the King of the Mahis.

409
01:10:31,474 --> 01:10:37,674
The dead eat so...
The dead drink so.

410
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:54,625
I have sworn, in my swearinghouse...
to conquer the Egbas.

411
01:10:55,765 --> 01:11:00,134
I fear nobody.
I have only one fear.

412
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:02,994
And that is that one day...

413
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:07,842
there may be anyone left
to be conquered.

414
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:14,005
But tell me, white man...
why have the Portuguese...

415
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:20,088
brought three hundred and thirty-five
thousand warships to my shore?

416
01:11:23,059 --> 01:11:26,551
And why did you
poison my greyhound?

417
01:12:39,535 --> 01:12:42,561
The snow... the... snow.

418
01:13:27,049 --> 01:13:29,415
Quickly! Quickly! Kill the guards!

419
01:13:35,357 --> 01:13:37,757
I am Bakoko,
the confidant of the prince.

420
01:13:37,893 --> 01:13:40,088
Prince Kankpe is waiting for you.
Quickly, stranger, come with me!

421
01:13:40,196 --> 01:13:42,960
Where is Taparica!
You must take Taparica along!

422
01:13:57,646 --> 01:13:59,978
Why did you free us?

423
01:14:00,716 --> 01:14:05,744
Prince Kankpe has decided to
revolt against his uncle Ahadee.

424
01:14:05,921 --> 01:14:08,185
He is the rightful heir to the throne.

425
01:14:09,525 --> 01:14:13,427
Yesterday, King Bossa Ahadee
went up north with his entire army.

426
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:16,691
Out there live many hills.

427
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:27,469
We must overcome Bossa Ahadee.
But we'll need your help to do it.

428
01:14:28,144 --> 01:14:30,237
Our rebel warriors
have all disappointed us.

429
01:14:30,346 --> 01:14:32,940
The women are much more brave.

430
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:41,550
My father.

431
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:45,916
The traitor must die.

432
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:49,486
He has opened up the
graves of our ancestors!

433
01:15:12,922 --> 01:15:15,584
We will go down to
the fortress on the coast...

434
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:18,558
and there we will establish
an army of Amazons.

435
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:24,727
The prince would like to make a
pact of blood brotherhood with you.

436
01:15:25,401 --> 01:15:28,893
Blood brothers do not kill each other.

437
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,466
lf the new king will turn over
the slave trade to me...

438
01:15:34,577 --> 01:15:36,101
...then I am his man.

439
01:15:38,581 --> 01:15:41,744
Does he have the vaguest notion
what we're talking about?

440
01:15:43,819 --> 01:15:47,311
He is in agreement.
He has no choice.

441
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:53,854
He says yes to anything.
You see, he is quite insane.

442
01:16:18,988 --> 01:16:24,119
All right! Over there!
What a wretched mess.

443
01:16:24,526 --> 01:16:27,620
Listen to me! I said over there!
All of you!

444
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:37,200
You'll have to get up quicker,
if you don't want to get killed.

445
01:16:51,587 --> 01:16:53,555
I've got four hundred new recruits.
Where do you want them?

446
01:16:53,656 --> 01:16:55,123
Not over here.
Take them down to the shore.

447
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:56,953
They all want to fight!
They want to kill all the men.

448
01:16:57,059 --> 01:16:58,048
Don't bother me now.

449
01:16:58,193 --> 01:17:01,185
I've got to get this herd
of women organized first.

450
01:17:07,703 --> 01:17:09,864
- Shields up!
- Watch what you do with that spear!

451
01:17:18,547 --> 01:17:20,742
All right! Now, fight!

452
01:17:25,587 --> 01:17:27,054
No, you've got it all wrong!

453
01:17:27,156 --> 01:17:29,716
You've got to hold
your spear like this...

454
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:32,225
and keep your feet moving.
Like this!

455
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,660
Here, you take it.

456
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:45,031
Attack, damn you!

457
01:17:52,181 --> 01:17:55,617
Let's have that cutlass!
Come on, attack! Attack!

458
01:17:55,751 --> 01:17:58,185
Keep your spear up!
Defend yourself.

459
01:17:58,287 --> 01:18:00,278
Cover your body with the shield!

460
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:06,760
lf you trip and fall,
it's the end of you! Haaa! Haaa!

461
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:15,535
Come on! Get a move on!

462
01:19:05,988 --> 01:19:09,355
One! Two!

463
01:19:10,859 --> 01:19:13,885
Three! Four!

464
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:16,930
Five! And take the enemy!

465
01:19:20,202 --> 01:19:23,467
Not bad... All right, now get
back in your starting positions.

466
01:19:23,572 --> 01:19:27,770
Come on, quicker, keep moving!

467
01:19:29,912 --> 01:19:33,211
And now... ready!?

468
01:19:33,549 --> 01:19:36,450
Attack position.
No, no, no, no!... At ease!

469
01:19:37,152 --> 01:19:40,883
The whole thing again faster!
In position!

470
01:19:42,524 --> 01:19:47,985
One! Two! Three!

471
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:53,627
Who told them they could take a rest?

472
01:20:32,674 --> 01:20:34,972
Who told them they could take a rest?

473
01:20:35,077 --> 01:20:36,977
On your feet now, come on.

474
01:20:37,112 --> 01:20:39,876
- Keep on moving!
- Come on, come on!

475
01:20:39,982 --> 01:20:40,971
Get up!

476
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:44,177
We don't want to practice anymore.
We want to fight!

477
01:20:44,286 --> 01:20:48,780
I swear I will bring back Bossa
Ahadee's head - single-handed!

478
01:20:48,957 --> 01:20:50,686
No, you're not yet ready.

479
01:20:50,826 --> 01:20:56,594
You've got to keep on practicing.
You've got to obey my orders.

480
01:20:56,698 --> 01:21:00,293
Come on. I don't want to hear
any more from you.

481
01:21:00,402 --> 01:21:03,633
I want you to hear what
I have to say. I command here.

482
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:07,698
No one else! And we're going
to continue practicing.

483
01:21:07,809 --> 01:21:11,176
No more arguments from you.
Only that way can we succeed.

484
01:21:12,281 --> 01:21:14,545
We will storm the palace
soon enough.

485
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:26,219
I've made my decision! We attack!

486
01:21:29,031 --> 01:21:33,798
We march out tomorrow.
Fight, fight, fight, fight...

487
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:40,202
Fight, fight, fight, fight...

488
01:22:23,185 --> 01:22:25,915
Off to Abomey!

489
01:24:36,585 --> 01:24:39,349
They have taken the
sacred python from the temple.

490
01:24:39,454 --> 01:24:42,048
We must turn back -
nobody gets past it alive!

491
01:24:42,157 --> 01:24:44,717
In my country, I was a snake myself!

492
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:47,590
Out of the way! Attack! Attack!

493
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,808
The dead kings have deposed you.

494
01:25:42,717 --> 01:25:45,208
So, now I will go and sleep.

495
01:25:48,857 --> 01:25:52,258
Wall up the doors
to the women's quarters.

496
01:26:08,109 --> 01:26:12,569
No! Don't let him get away!
Stop him! Hold Him!

497
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:16,310
Stay back. His wives will
strangle him now.

498
01:26:33,835 --> 01:26:36,668
The new king takes his seat!

499
01:26:39,508 --> 01:26:41,442
Shall I ask him to approach?

500
01:27:11,907 --> 01:27:14,774
He has given you
the name Adjinakou -

501
01:27:14,876 --> 01:27:16,969
that means ''green snake''.

502
01:27:17,078 --> 01:27:20,570
He has appointed you
Viceroy of Dahomey.

503
01:27:21,283 --> 01:27:25,743
Our King Kankpe gives you Fort
Elmina as your official residence.

504
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:08,721
We have to remove the glass
windows from the main house.

505
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:11,025
The servants sprinkled
them with water...

506
01:28:11,132 --> 01:28:13,965
because they believed the
rising sun set them on fire.

507
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:15,161
You'd do better to see to it...

508
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:17,534
the ventilation in the slave
quarters is improved.

509
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:20,301
- Too many are dying.
- Yes, Adjinakou.

510
01:28:23,278 --> 01:28:25,269
We'll have to get them shipped faster.

511
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:28,349
The captain of the Flor de Bahia
has the best quarters in town -

512
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:30,645
I gave him the east wing.

513
01:28:30,885 --> 01:28:32,716
And the relays are all prepared.

514
01:28:32,821 --> 01:28:35,051
Tomorrow they will all be in position.

515
01:28:35,156 --> 01:28:37,920
The distance is twenty-three
thousand five hundred bamboo poles.

516
01:28:38,026 --> 01:28:40,517
That will be a great
surprise for our king.

517
01:28:54,342 --> 01:28:58,438
They're offering you a place in
the syndicate back in Bahia.

518
01:28:59,347 --> 01:29:01,474
I don't need that crap!

519
01:29:02,183 --> 01:29:04,777
And why haven't I received
the ships that I asked for?

520
01:29:04,886 --> 01:29:06,786
I don't know, Don Francisco.

521
01:29:08,356 --> 01:29:10,517
But I will bring it to
the governor's attention...

522
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:13,093
- as soon as I return.
- This is an outrage!

523
01:29:29,744 --> 01:29:33,475
This is the second shipment of slaves
you've received without payment.

524
01:29:33,581 --> 01:29:36,550
I'm not sure I can trust your word.

525
01:30:09,284 --> 01:30:11,718
Sometimes I get a bit tired.

526
01:30:14,823 --> 01:30:17,383
Tonight I won't take any of them.

527
01:30:18,259 --> 01:30:20,489
Which one would you like to have?

528
01:30:25,133 --> 01:30:26,122
That one.

529
01:30:27,068 --> 01:30:28,865
You there - come on up!

530
01:30:33,274 --> 01:30:34,605
Yes, you!

531
01:30:36,911 --> 01:30:39,277
lf they get pregnant,
they aren't taken aboard.

532
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:41,541
Then they get their own hut out here.

533
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:44,678
We've already got
a whole village full of them.

534
01:30:44,786 --> 01:30:49,814
- Who are these women?
- Our future murderers.

535
01:31:17,652 --> 01:31:20,382
Send the signals!
I want to write a letter for you...

536
01:31:20,488 --> 01:31:22,183
to take back to my partners in Brazil.

537
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:24,087
It's going to take about
an hour and a half...

538
01:31:24,192 --> 01:31:25,955
before I get an
answering signal anyway.

539
01:32:28,223 --> 01:32:33,126
I cannot begin to describe this
cretinous existence of mine.

540
01:32:33,328 --> 01:32:38,459
Nor how lonely it is to be
without family or friends.

541
01:32:38,967 --> 01:32:41,401
The only white man in this country...

542
01:32:41,502 --> 01:32:43,527
perhaps on this whole continent.

543
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:48,600
Meanwhile I have become the
father of sixty-two children...

544
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:51,110
but this gives me no satisfaction.

545
01:32:51,346 --> 01:32:55,009
Perhaps next year
I shall come back and marry.

546
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:59,352
I would live in the lands
of ice and snow...

547
01:32:59,454 --> 01:33:02,116
anywhere to be away from here...

548
01:33:06,494 --> 01:33:10,089
The heat here is
mean and inescapable.

549
01:33:10,932 --> 01:33:14,197
It courses through the
bodies of the people like a fever -

550
01:33:14,836 --> 01:33:18,738
and yet my heart grows
colder and colder.

551
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:53,198
Adjinakou... there's
an answer coming back.

552
01:34:28,409 --> 01:34:32,311
The king sends his brother the
Royal Leopard Salute.

553
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:46,449
This one's about nineteen -
looks strong and healthy.

554
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,458
He must be about twenty-five -
a good, hard boy.

555
01:34:55,570 --> 01:35:00,473
This one's about the same age.
And he's a very strong boy also.

556
01:37:24,118 --> 01:37:27,610
- You obviously like my nuns' choir.
- Nun's choir. Not bad.

557
01:37:27,722 --> 01:37:30,316
Do you know Pedro Vincente,
the captain of the Flor de Bahia?

558
01:37:30,424 --> 01:37:31,982
Yes, I do.

559
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:35,020
How much would some
interesting news be worth to you?

560
01:37:35,129 --> 01:37:36,460
I won't cheat you.

561
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,631
Pedro Vincente took a large
consignment of slaves off your hands.

562
01:37:42,737 --> 01:37:44,204
He never paid.

563
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:48,473
Then let me tell you what
I saw with my own eyes.

564
01:37:48,576 --> 01:37:51,136
The Flor de Bahia was
brimming over with cargo.

565
01:37:51,245 --> 01:37:53,873
He cheated you.

566
01:37:54,782 --> 01:37:58,479
He's gone and dumped all his
weapons and goods to the British -

567
01:37:58,619 --> 01:38:00,644
made a double profit on the deal.

568
01:38:00,755 --> 01:38:03,246
And guess what happened
to the Flor de Bahia!

569
01:38:03,357 --> 01:38:07,054
She's drifting off shore
near Lagos... unseaworthy.

570
01:38:07,161 --> 01:38:09,288
And on top of that,
the crew has mutinied...

571
01:38:09,397 --> 01:38:11,490
which means now
you've got him trapped.

572
01:38:16,304 --> 01:38:20,900
You take a cutter and deliver
a message to Captain Vincente.

573
01:38:21,008 --> 01:38:24,910
''Come here. I'll re-equip you.
Nobody cheats me twice.''

574
01:38:51,572 --> 01:38:54,097
Come on, move on...
and take everything.

575
01:38:56,244 --> 01:38:59,611
Hey! What is the meaning of this?

576
01:39:00,014 --> 01:39:05,509
Our King Kankpe was never insane.
He only pretended to be.

577
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:09,553
He thanks his brother,
who was once the viceroy.

578
01:39:09,824 --> 01:39:12,224
The blood brother of the king
was a big tree...

579
01:39:12,326 --> 01:39:13,850
... and that's what he
wants you to know.

580
01:39:13,961 --> 01:39:16,589
Why does the king speak
of me only in the past tense?

581
01:39:16,697 --> 01:39:18,289
Adjinakou, things look very bad...

582
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:20,594
but as long as Kankpe is king
you're fairly safe.

583
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:22,828
He would never kill a blood brother.

584
01:39:24,038 --> 01:39:25,562
There are still some rifles in there.

585
01:39:25,673 --> 01:39:28,574
Where's his money?
Come on, hurry up!

586
01:40:10,418 --> 01:40:14,548
- Do you really want to help me?
- I keep my word.

587
01:40:14,655 --> 01:40:16,520
But that won't help me anymore...

588
01:40:16,624 --> 01:40:18,489
and it won't help you either!

589
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:20,994
Brazil's joined the rest of the world...

590
01:40:21,095 --> 01:40:22,653
and abolished the slave trade.

591
01:40:22,763 --> 01:40:24,560
Any shipments currently under way...

592
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:26,690
will be seized on the high seas.

593
01:40:27,668 --> 01:40:29,568
In the eyes of the law...

594
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:34,539
Fort Elmina and our lives
have ceased to exist.

595
01:40:34,775 --> 01:40:37,141
And while I'm at it,
there's something else.

596
01:40:37,244 --> 01:40:40,008
I know that for at least one year...

597
01:40:40,114 --> 01:40:43,948
you've been slandered and cheated
by your partners in Bahia.

598
01:40:44,085 --> 01:40:47,282
Your assets have all been
confiscated by the state bank.

599
01:40:47,388 --> 01:40:51,256
And in addition, the English
have put a price on your head.

600
01:40:54,028 --> 01:40:56,292
Finally something's happened.

601
01:41:00,868 --> 01:41:04,565
Finally something's happened.

602
01:41:10,611 --> 01:41:12,135
To slavery...

603
01:41:12,446 --> 01:41:16,644
the greatest misunderstanding
in the history of mankind!

604
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:24,988
It was no misunderstanding.
It was a crime.

605
01:41:32,299 --> 01:41:39,865
Slavery is an element of the
human heart... To our ruin!

606
01:47:47,441 --> 01:47:55,974
The slaves will sell their masters
and grow wings.
