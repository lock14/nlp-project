1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,133
Here come the balloons.

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,217
We chose balloons

3
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:13,430
because we were thinking
of an airy and lighthearted movie.

4
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,224
l'm Eric Darnell.

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,978
And l'm Tom McGrath.
We're the co-directors of this movie.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,400
They say talking about film
is like dancing about architecture,

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,485
but we'll do our best.

8
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,242
Comes Marty, the voice of Chris Rock,
doing a Tarzan yell.

9
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:37,078
We actually
found some original Tarzan yells

10
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,705
and played them for Chris.

11
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,374
Even the original Tarzan yells
were manufactured.

12
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:45,670
-Nobody could actually do that.
-Not even Johnny Weissmuller.

13
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,048
l think he might have,
but it was all edited.

14
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:51,176
Chris did his best
and it came out pretty funny.

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,302
Very funny.

16
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:57,140
Ben also does it a little later on,
which is quite a challenge to do.

17
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:04,397
lt's always fun doing slow motion
in computer animation

18
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:08,318
because it has to be animated
in slow motion.

19
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,364
lt's not like we animate it at
normal speed and then slow it down.

20
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,786
Here comes the lion.

21
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,792
Ben Stiller, of course,
is the voice ofAlex.

22
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:28,588
And we wake up
right in the heart of New York City.

23
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:31,883
Kendal Cronkhite and Shannon
did a great job

24
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:35,720
of kind of simplifying and idealising
the Central Park Zoo,

25
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,264
which is a great location for us,

26
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:40,475
because it's smack dab
in the middle of Manhattan

27
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:44,145
and surrounded
by these wonderful skyscrapers.

28
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,028
lf you look closely at the environment,

29
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,823
it does look like New York City
in many ways.

30
00:01:54,907 --> 00:02:00,620
lt is stylised and modified somewhat,
but on a more detailed level

31
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:05,834
midpoint of not having
any parallel lines in New York City,

32
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,211
something we called "the whack factor,"

33
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,630
which gave everything
just a bit of a style.

34
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:11,798
A little askew.

35
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,801
Sort of matched the style
of the design of our characters.

36
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,972
Plus we wanted to
have this opening in the fall.

37
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,976
And the art department
used this great muted palette,

38
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,313
kind of showing the city
and romanticizing it at the same time.

39
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:30,150
So when we went to Madagascar,
it'd just explode with colour.

40
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:40,952
So it's sort of... We start the film
with this talky sequence

41
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,330
as we introduce these two characters.

42
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:47,000
And Ben and Chris
just both did a great job,

43
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:51,129
energising this dialogue and giving
the animators material to work with

44
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,091
so we could keep it interesting.
Here goes Alex up on the wall.

45
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:58,928
lt is great.

46
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:03,350
The animators had a great time
just pushing the movement like this

47
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:06,770
and finding these strong poses,
hitting them and sticking them

48
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,857
and staying on these poses
to kind of really push the attitudes.

49
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,318
Here comes the people.

50
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,738
There's the lion chasing the zebra,
a little joke on the clock.

51
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,035
So we go around the horn here.

52
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:26,039
We meet everybody,
just trying to set up their routine

53
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:30,710
and how Alex loves the routine
of performing for the crowds

54
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:36,174
and he's the most energetic
about the whole idea of being a star.

55
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:41,388
You see something
very normal and simple,

56
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:45,100
at least it looks simple, when you
look at that water that Gloria's in.

57
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:49,396
Every time we have
some organic thing like that,

58
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,401
water, wind, particles of dirt
or sand or whatever,

59
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,237
it's a big task
for the effects department to put that in.

60
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,822
Nothing's for free.

61
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,032
Crowds were very much
a huge challenge

62
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:04,160
and having all the variations of people.

63
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,164
Here's our monkeys.

64
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,791
Conrad Vernon,

65
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:16,172
actually the voice of
the Gingerbread Man in the Shrek film

66
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,091
is the voice of our monkey.

67
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,802
Mason, we call him.
Sounds like James Mason...

68
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,929
After James Mason, yeah.

69
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,309
A spit, just that water coming out.

70
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:31,104
Big task for some effects animators
to pull that off.

71
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,190
And they have to do spits a lot
in this movie.

72
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,068
We have about 50 spit takes, l believe.

73
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,954
So here's where Hans comes in.

74
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,708
Hans Zimmer, our composer,
gave us some great music.

75
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:56,629
He found a theme for our characters
that he, you know, was playing here.

76
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:59,716
And he found a large number
of variations on that theme

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,509
that we could use later, emotionally,

78
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:05,388
to really kind of hit the friendship
between Alex and Marty.

79
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:26,576
Masses of people,
huge challenge for our crowd guys.

80
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,413
So this is really...

81
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:34,417
We tried to take a point of view
from the people looking at the animals,

82
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,921
to set up the lives our characters
go through every day.

83
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,757
This is their normal routine.
We wanted to show that.

84
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,177
One of our best actors.

85
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,348
The highly trained Tom McGrath
as the voice of the Skipper.

86
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,392
Just kind of fell into it.
l'd voice it in pitches

87
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:55,104
and we actually wanted someone like
Robert Stack,

88
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,941
this tough guy in a little penguin body.

89
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,366
We'll often do the voices just to fill in

90
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,493
until we can get the actor in
and record them.

91
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,037
And Tom did the voice of the Skipper.

92
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,499
When it came time to cast,
we just figured Tom sounds good.

93
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,626
Let's keep him in there.

94
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,968
So Marty tried his best
to get into the routine,

95
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,805
find something different,
but it didn't quite do it for him.

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,645
Beautiful afternoon lighting,
almost magic-hour lighting here.

97
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,731
Nice warm glow in the afternoon,
fall feeling.

98
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,407
Originally, Marty was inspired
to go to the wild

99
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,243
by just his mural alone,

100
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,079
and then we found out
we could use these little guys,

101
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,541
these penguins escaping,
to plant the seed in his head

102
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,627
that there was something else out there
besides the zoo.

103
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,213
And it's just one of the cases we found

104
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,882
we could use the penguins
throughout the film

105
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:11,431
to kind of be a little mirror
of wanting to find your roots,

106
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,433
the same thing Marty's going through.

107
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,269
They go through their own version of it.

108
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:41,794
He's explained it,
very clearly now, laid it out.

109
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,880
Chris Rock, very excited.

110
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,725
l always liked that joke.

111
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,734
Marty's got some new ideas
to think about.

112
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,996
So you know, it's interesting.

113
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:21,793
To think that every time
you see anything on-screen,

114
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,713
somebody had to go in and figure out
how to make it,

115
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,341
get it up onto the screen,
what it should look like,

116
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,593
how it should move, how it should feel.

117
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:37,183
With animation of, you know,
in any medium, nothing is for free.

118
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,851
Everything that you see is on-screen.

119
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,105
So like those fireworks,
those cheering crowds,

120
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,233
are all positioned and designed,

121
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,653
even these little elements
you see on-screen.

122
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,613
Obviously, forjust seconds,

123
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:55,243
whether it's Gloria's fruit bowl
or Melman's medications,

124
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,871
are all designed from scratch

125
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,500
by artists and technicians

126
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,962
and put in place by animators
and given surfaces,

127
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,131
so that they reflect the light properly.

128
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,967
And then lights are applied to them.

129
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,220
lt's a huge undertaking forjust,
you know,

130
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:20,101
every moment, every second of film,
in a process like this.

131
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:26,232
lt's one of the reasons that we do have
two directors for a movie like this,

132
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,234
or at least why we like to do it that way,

133
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:33,156
is because there are just so many
decisions to be made every day,

134
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,367
not just about
what the characters say and do,

135
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,244
but what those bars look like
on that cage

136
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,497
or what the surface of that tree
should be.

137
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:45,960
Originally, with that monkey,
the teacup build,

138
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,920
originally we had a martini glass.

139
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,632
We decided we needed to take that out.

140
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,635
-Make it more universal.
-More universal.

141
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,137
Tea is much more universal.

142
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:01,267
lt works with his character too,
having a tea and a teacup and saucer.

143
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:12,278
But, everything on, including that
whipped cream is a big ordeal

144
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,821
because it has to move
with Marty's mouth

145
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,157
and feel like it's connected.

146
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,661
Marty just dropped the bomb
on his friends.

147
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:38,346
So this is a point in the film, you know,
this scene, rewritten many times,

148
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,058
and how to best show
Marty's love for the wild

149
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,937
and what his dream is,
and we wanted to have it

150
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,482
in an intimate conversation
from all the noise in the zoo.

151
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,610
The art department put this light
right in the centre

152
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,904
and made this little table
so that it felt like

153
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,491
they're just sitting around
a dining room table as friends would,

154
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,994
just to try and get that feeling.

155
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,208
And Marty's kind of pushed aside
as his friends downplay his ideas.

156
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,338
One of the goals of this is
how we portray the city,

157
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,883
and we try to tell the movie
through their point of view,

158
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:20,638
to have them know only the things that
they would see or perhaps hear about.

159
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:25,017
And so we try to always see
the film unfold from their eyes.

160
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:55,006
We wanted to keep them very naïve
and have, you know, their knowledge

161
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,719
kind of play into what is believable

162
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,804
-with animals in a zoo.
-Right.

163
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,558
And yet, from their perspective, they
consider themselves New Yorkers,

164
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,519
which is what this premise is all about.

165
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:12,732
Take four New York City zoo animals,
New Yorkers to the core,

166
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:16,527
and dump them into the wild.
How would they survive?

167
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:32,335
For a lot of that New York sensibility,
we worked with Peter Mehlman,

168
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:37,423
who was a producer/writer for Seinfeld
for many years.

169
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:44,221
He helped to sort of find
that New York sensibility and rhythm.

170
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,140
And language, too.

171
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,101
Came up with some great dialogue.

172
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,772
-That helicopterjoke.
-The helicopterjoke was Peter's.

173
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,446
And of course,
Mark Burton and Billy Frolick,

174
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,574
writing partners on this,
did a wonderful job

175
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,869
laying this story out for us
when we first began.

176
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,915
Really focusing on the story
between a zebra and a lion

177
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,877
that you wouldn't expect to be friends

178
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,380
and they really kind of honed in
on that idea

179
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,132
as kind of the centrepiece for the story,

180
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,469
this kind of fable about these animals,

181
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,390
this predator/prey
that should never be friends.

182
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:33,145
So that's the heart,
and this scene here is purely to show

183
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,649
how close and what kind of history
these guys share.

184
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,902
You know, originally,
this was a big song and dance number

185
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:44,740
and it went into a huge fantasy musical
kind of Busby Berkeley thing,

186
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:49,370
you know, to show Alex's viewpoint
against Marty's viewpoint.

187
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,831
But we felt at this point in the story,

188
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,000
we've already said that
in many other ways,

189
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:58,212
so it seemed kind
of a redundant kind of idea.

190
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,465
So it just came down to a few bars
<i>of New York, New York.</i>

191
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,220
l always liked this scene where,
classic apartments, buildings,

192
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,348
New Yorkers yelling at each other
to be quiet.

193
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,855
The process for writing
and developing a film like this

194
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:20,484
is perhaps a little bit different
than a live action film.

195
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,530
We do try to start with a script.
lt's flexible.

196
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,616
We can modify and change it
and do by design,

197
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,953
by our process,
continue to develop ideas

198
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,248
as we take them into other parts
of our production process,

199
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,876
which include storyboarding,

200
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,503
where we basically draw out
a comic book version

201
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,380
of every scene of the film.

202
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:45,634
And the story artists can put a lot of
new ideas into the process that way,

203
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,511
both on how they stage things.

204
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,390
They may come up with new gags
and lines of dialogue

205
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:56,145
that help inform the scene.
And it's a very iterative process.

206
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:01,525
We just do it over and over again,
refining and redoing sequences,

207
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,403
looking at them together
and seeing how they play out,

208
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,405
rewriting scenes,

209
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,492
and that goes on
throughout the production process,

210
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,453
which in this case was about four years.

211
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,459
Not enough credit can be given
to storyboard artists.

212
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,797
Like this light that he claps on
and off came out of a storyboard artist.

213
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,635
They're writers themselves and actors

214
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,012
and they really come up
with a lot of the great things you see.

215
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,933
Plus the animators
really add little nuances

216
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:38,854
and little things that kind of make
the characters even more believable.

217
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,272
lt's a great example here.

218
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:46,070
As Marty looks at his wall,
l think it was Manu who animated this,

219
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,239
put this little scratch on his ankle
in there

220
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,118
and it just makes you feel like
he's a living thing, you know.

221
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,453
Originally in the first version
of the script,

222
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:58,791
all the animals were darted by activists

223
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,127
and shipped away from the zoo,

224
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:05,131
unbeknownst to our characters,
they had no idea what was happening.

225
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,508
Then as the story evolved,

226
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,303
we found it stronger
that Marty would be so obsessed

227
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,056
with seeing the wild
that he would actually escape,

228
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:18,727
and cause the others to be worried
and follow after him.

229
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,855
lt's a little bit more active
on Marty's part.

230
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,358
Plus we got to
bring the characters out into the city

231
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,943
and see how they interacted

232
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:30,656
and how much of a fish out of water
they are in their own city.

233
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,576
And they're completely oblivious to it.

234
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,667
We have these three neurotic
sort of New York males in the film

235
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:47,673
and with our one female lead, the hippo,
voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith,

236
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:52,219
we wanted a tough, strong character,

237
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,639
and you wouldn't think of Jada
necessarily off the bat,

238
00:16:55,724 --> 00:17:00,769
because she's so petite
and nowhere near a hippo.

239
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:04,565
But when you hear her voice,
it's so commanding and strong

240
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,734
and it's just the thing we needed

241
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:11,697
to sort of help keep these
three neurotic males in line

242
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,618
and Jada just did a wonderful job
as the voice of the hippo.

243
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,330
We did something different
with the camera here,

244
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,540
give it a handheld feel,

245
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,502
which adds to the frenetic nature
of the sequence.

246
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,171
Something you and Johnson
threw in there

247
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:31,133
just to add
that hectic kind of nature to it.

248
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,927
Great expressions.

249
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,056
Another gag here added
by a story artist,

250
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,475
just break it off and throw it.

251
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:48,859
l think that's the only food joke
from Gloria in the whole film.

252
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,738
Which we kind of tried to avoid.

253
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,784
We wanted Gloria to be big and robust,

254
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,745
but to be a beautiful hippo
and not have to worry about

255
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,872
make her a character
where she's worried about eating

256
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,666
or has a weight problem

257
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,294
because hippos are 800 pounds
and they're proud of it.

258
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,524
A great pose
when Gloria busts out that brick wall.

259
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:39,076
So we wanted to get the monkeys
to be transferred as well,

260
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,288
so they became
part of this little escape,

261
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:46,458
with their own agenda,
to go see Tom Wolfe.

262
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,088
Rockefeller Centre.

263
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,716
Getting some of these icons in here.

264
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,846
We thought, what better way to

265
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,058
push these characters through
New York better than on a subway?

266
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,602
That's one of the things,
being in the city,

267
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,188
that every New Yorker
is well familiar with

268
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,399
is the subway.

269
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:14,653
So we just tried to capture that
as best we could, that experience.

270
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,492
When Marty is travelling through the city
he's in wide open space

271
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:24,288
and these guys
are cramped and claustrophobic

272
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:29,710
and in smaller spaces,
just to kind of contrast

273
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,755
Marty and his friends.

274
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,470
Melman has these Kleenex boxes
on his feet,

275
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,764
the little tip of the hat
to Howard Hughes.

276
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,569
Classic shot of New York City landmark,
Times Square.

277
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,530
There's a lot of animation
in those signs.

278
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,640
That "What are you going to do?"
is another Peter Mehlman thing.

279
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,226
lt always makes me smile.

280
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,480
lt's such a little thing
but such a nice touch.

281
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,859
Now, that is actually
a model of Grand Central Station,

282
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:39,196
a beautiful set
that they built inside the computer,

283
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,824
so you can shoot it from any angle.

284
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,828
And it's one of those things as before,

285
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,414
a little bit whacked out,
a little whack factor.

286
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:54,753
lt's identical but things have been
simplified and kind of caricatured.

287
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:58,173
But all to make you feel like
you're actually there.

288
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,888
A little bit over the top with the...

289
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:09,935
And had some fun with the audio,
sound effects, of some of this stuff.

290
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,606
lt was a fine line, you know.
Where do you go, way over the top

291
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,109
and have those kind of cartoon-y
sound effects.

292
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,778
We tried to find
the best balance we could.

293
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:23,115
But that old lady is great,
and that's, for even little kids,

294
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,702
they just love seeing
a lion get hit with a purse.

295
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,458
And that was fun
to be able to do slapstick.

296
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,959
That was part of our conceit,

297
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:39,882
to have a lot of the action and motion
be entertaining as well.

298
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:44,678
And just like, you know, years of
traditional animation has done.

299
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,142
So we've sort of reached a place now
with computer animation technology

300
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:54,813
where if you've got the talented people,
and the time and resources

301
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:58,150
you can really do
just about anything you can dream up.

302
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:02,321
There was a reason why
the first computer animated films

303
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:07,326
were toys and insects,
things with exoskeletons,

304
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,955
because it's really hard
to get that sort of furry fleshy feeling

305
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,832
with computer animation.

306
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,960
Well, it's still hard, but it's
certainly possible today.

307
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,672
So we could really push that
and make these characters organic

308
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,841
and squash them
and stretch them in ways

309
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:27,221
that we've seen in traditional
hand-drawn animation,

310
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,390
but perhaps not as much
in computer animation.

311
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,852
That's a great joke.

312
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,897
At least l think so.

313
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:46,365
This is so tremendously difficult to...
A huge number of crowds.

314
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,750
Even they have to keep breathing
and moving even subtly

315
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,835
so they don't just freeze up and...

316
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,636
Here she comes again.

317
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,517
That was Elisa, her name was.

318
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,936
She was one
of the loop group voice people

319
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:21,149
who just threw a great voice
on that side character.

320
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:29,658
One of the rare times here where
we go for the human's point of view.

321
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:35,080
One of the things we discovered
when they transfer animals,

322
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,583
they use very heavy drugs.

323
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,795
lt kind of inspired a way

324
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,048
to do our version
<i>of Pink Elephants On Parade,</i>

325
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:51,513
to have this little fantasy thing
that only animation can do,

326
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,850
that brings out
just a little something special

327
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,185
and we thought
it was very funny that he would have

328
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,272
this kind of a hallucination.

329
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,316
And twice, by the way.

330
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,125
So this is our
"guilty of exposition" scene,

331
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,962
where we really needed to find a way

332
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,964
to explain
what the people's motives were

333
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,134
and why they were transferring
these animals,

334
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,387
because they didn't think they were
happy and 'cause they escaped.

335
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,599
We thought it'd be funny
to show it through Alex's point of view.

336
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,352
And then get darted again.

337
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,855
One thing people ask
about the characters,

338
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,941
are they designed after the actors?

339
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:48,320
'Cause they look like them
in some cases, but they're not.

340
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:52,366
They're designed well in advance
of casting in some cases,

341
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,326
in most cases, in our case here.

342
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,496
But the thing is, when they're
performing behind the mike,

343
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,998
we do videotape them.

344
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,000
And it's something we don't copy,

345
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,044
but we give it to the animators
to inspire them.

346
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:07,089
They're also inspired
by other performances.

347
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,174
And they add these little nuances
in the faces,

348
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:12,219
these little facial expressions
the actors give.

349
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:17,182
So it really makes these characters
look sometimes like the actors.

350
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:21,103
But that's how that kind of gets in there.

351
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,648
They find an essence somehow.

352
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:29,111
So this was one of the first shots
that we animated on the film,

353
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,239
because they're just
essentially on stage.

354
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:36,034
lt gave the animators a chance
to really find a style and a tone

355
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,912
for the way we want to
move these characters around.

356
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:43,083
Six animators had worked on this shot,

357
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,794
and the time on the shot is incredible.

358
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:50,006
lt's close to 30 seconds, l believe,
and so it's a very long shot.

359
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,718
Different animators would work
on different characters.

360
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:53,969
This is one of the...

361
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:58,223
Just a flat graphic moment
we could take, cinematically.

362
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:02,144
And we thought it'd be interesting
to shoot it all as a single shot

363
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,229
with all these characters
coming on-screen,

364
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,898
and a few times in the movie
where we have

365
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,692
this kind of proscenium staging,

366
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,153
to take a break from the cinematics of it.

367
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,487
Always enjoy watching this

368
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:15,490
and watching the characters
that aren't speaking,

369
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:20,162
see how the animators have chosen
to keep them alive and thinking.

370
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,456
You always feel like there's
something going on in their heads,

371
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,292
even when they're not speaking.

372
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,211
Pretty amazing for a first shot
and it really set the tone

373
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:33,091
for some of the nuances in how
these characters move and react.

374
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:36,970
Here's Tommy.

375
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,930
Originally we didn't have
a lot of the sets built too,

376
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:42,225
so this was a great choice
to flex the muscles of the characters

377
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,687
and they can build these crates
relatively easy,

378
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:50,192
so that's why it was one of the first
scenes to be animated.

379
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,110
l've always enjoyed this reveal.

380
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:56,615
We kept trying
to think of a name for the boat.

381
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,242
<i>We had Lollipop for</i>
<i>lt's A Good Ship Lollipop.</i>

382
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,952
We had SS Act Two.

383
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,288
We put names on the boat

384
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:07,375
and it just drew your eye
right to the name instead of the scene.

385
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,801
Those are cans of root beer,
just in case,

386
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:18,094
if anybody was wondering.

387
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,888
Root beer, not beer.

388
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:24,309
This was one of the first scenes
that was boarded in the film,

389
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:28,230
and originally it was a storm at sea
that washed the crates overboard.

390
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:33,985
But so many films had been done,
castaways, at the time, you know,

391
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,446
and there was so many storms,
that we decided...

392
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:39,032
<i>And Gilligan's lsland</i>
had been out for quite some time.

393
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,786
So we decided it'd be fun
to use some of these characters,

394
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,538
when the entire zoo
was being transferred,

395
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:46,915
and have them do a little jailbreak.

396
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,836
So this was really
the scene for these penguins

397
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,172
and for a while this was their only
moment in the film.

398
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:58,051
And we kept it in our screenings
and people just liked them,

399
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,555
so we just decided
to put them elsewhere in the film,

400
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:05,100
and found really good
storytelling places for them.

401
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,483
lt's a great addition,
the sound of that breaking coffee cup,

402
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:17,279
which was designed
by the sound effects folks.

403
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:33,670
Yeah, those guys, you know,
even with the little foley they did,

404
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,505
moving hay and everything,

405
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,551
add so much to the storytelling,
and a lot to the comedy.

406
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:44,764
A lot of the sound effects really made
some of these jokes play really well.

407
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:50,395
lt's just like the picture, the sound,
everything you hear has to be invented.

408
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,938
'Cause there is no real place

409
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:55,400
where you can record penguins
slapping each other like this,

410
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,111
so every sound, every step on a
keyboard,

411
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:02,616
every handshake
or wave or slide across a deck.

412
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,204
That was a little something Rex Grignon
added there, that penguin sliding.

413
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,416
Also on that map on the wall
behind the penguin when he shrugs,

414
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,212
it said "Madagascar,"
and that was one of the only times

415
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,882
we ever wanted to see Madagascar
originally in the film.

416
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,759
We never even wanted to mention it.

417
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:24,596
We didn't want anyone to say it,
but we caved in.

418
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,432
-We caved in.
-We did, we caved in,

419
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,561
and, l think,
Julien the lemur introduces it later.

420
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,775
You want to talk
about the genesis of this?

421
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:40,528
This sequence, my brother's wife,

422
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,449
her father was in the Navy

423
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,201
and they were doing war games,

424
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,954
and he was repainting a deck
and got washed overboard.

425
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,457
And he always described the story
about being caught in these swells

426
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,710
as when he dipped down 50 feet
and came up

427
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,713
the boat was just a little further away.

428
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,340
lt was so graphic and visual,

429
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:04,260
we thought maybe
from Alex's point of view

430
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:07,055
he would go through
the same experience.

431
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,649
And we had Marty in his box

432
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,318
and water was spraying out
of different holes

433
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:24,030
and he was using all his hooves
to cover it, but it was very funny.

434
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:28,243
But then it looks like
Marty was dead after it

435
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:32,080
for a long time,
so we decided to keep it with just Alex.

436
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:36,209
Well, even this here
is a dramatic moment.

437
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,670
Alex arrives on the beach all alone

438
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:42,382
and he's scared and worried
about himself and the others.

439
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,343
And yet we still try to find ways
to keep it fun and visual,

440
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:48,388
as he holds onto his tongue
or as he rolls up onto the beach

441
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,306
and the sand
is coming out of his mouth.

442
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:54,060
Or this joke here, that he's
heading down towards the horizon.

443
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:57,939
-Cats hate water.
-Dan Wagner, he animated this,

444
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:01,109
and was finding ways
to push Alex even farther.

445
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:04,487
During the making of the film it was
always a challenge.

446
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:08,783
How far can we push these characters,

447
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,536
and see how far
we can take our animation?

448
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,540
lt's easy to be reserved and...

449
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:20,628
lt was great that Jeffrey Katzenberg
was so supportive of the animation style

450
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:25,925
we all wanted to do,
that he was even a big advocate

451
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,096
of pushing it as far as we can,
see what we could get away with.

452
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,811
Another place here
where the story artist

453
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:41,232
was given this idea ofAlex
coming across Melman

454
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:45,487
and was asked to figure out a way
to make it fun and physical and visual.

455
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:49,741
And so all of this action here,

456
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,368
pulling on Melman's neck
and grabbing this log,

457
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:56,206
was all invented by the story artist
who drew it up and presented it to us

458
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,876
on a big bulletin board,
like a comic book.

459
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,254
And you figure if you're laughing at that

460
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:07,967
when it's a black and white drawing
on a bulletin board,

461
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:10,178
then chances are you've got something.

462
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:17,685
And a car screech sound there
when Alex comes to a stop.

463
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,148
Coconut.

464
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,111
There are great little added sounds that,
you know...

465
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:30,657
There's only certain moments in these
where we really went over the top.

466
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,954
Like that clown horn.

467
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,123
That's always cracked me up.

468
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,347
We wanted to just keep the action going

469
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,100
and get all our characters
reunited quickly,

470
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,811
and try to hide the fact

471
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:03,648
that it's so convenient
they're all showing up at the same time.

472
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:09,237
But, you know, each little beat,
each little character gets his moment.

473
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:14,409
We have our pair,
back to back musical jokes here,

474
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,371
<i>with Hawaii Five-O</i>
<i>and now Chariots Of Fire’</i>

475
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,499
and we thought about,
can we really get away with those

476
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:24,919
just running up against each other?
We decided yes.

477
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,713
We can.

478
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:31,176
This is our little twist
on the little love affair,

479
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,261
which goes sour.

480
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,846
Again with the slow motion,

481
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,974
even all of those little lips
flapping around,

482
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:42,770
all hand-animated
to appear like slow motion.

483
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,653
So that line "sugar honey, ice tea"

484
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:53,489
that Marty says when he turns
and runs the other way,

485
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:56,784
is something
that Chris Rock came up with.

486
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,537
We have a lot of opportunity
to play around and be inventive

487
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:03,499
when we get into the studio
to record these actors.

488
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,543
There's a great shot of ourjungle
for the first time.

489
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:09,464
A lot of times we just had exclamations.
"Wow, this is great"

490
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,884
or, you know, something really ordinary,

491
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:16,221
and Chris and all the cast
were really great

492
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,598
at finding the language
for their character.

493
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:23,102
And Chris would come up
with funny exclamations.

494
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,064
Dagnabbit.

495
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:29,609
He'd say, "sugar honey iced tea."
And right here.

496
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,492
That's Chris Rock all the way.

497
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:42,497
But that's part of the process
that's so great, is we...

498
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,708
These actors just aren't names
on the marquee for us.

499
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,127
l mean, there's a reason
why they're famous,

500
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,463
it's because
they're so good at what they do.

501
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:54,550
And so when we get into the studio
with them, we let them fly.

502
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:57,345
lf they've got ideas, you know, we go.

503
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,057
We get it. And often it just is...
lt's just gold.

504
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:04,185
Like Ben running after Marty.
Ben standing behind a microphone.

505
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,437
He's jumping up and down,
acting out of breath.

506
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,772
We say, "You're chasing Marty

507
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,941
"telling him
how many ways you can kill him,"

508
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,945
Ben would just put his heart into it,
and it looked...

509
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:18,616
The performance is great.
lt really is convincing

510
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:22,370
that they're running
or moving or getting hit.

511
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:35,174
This is the first shot
of the jungle interior,

512
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,468
absolutely beautiful images.

513
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:40,930
The art department
created these environments for us.

514
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:44,809
The lighters who gave it
this wonderful glow,

515
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:48,229
not too bright,
'cause the sun is going down,

516
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:49,647
but it's just absolutely beautiful.

517
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:53,067
And again, it's always fun
to have Alex get beat up.

518
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,820
But we needed to detain him for later.

519
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,447
He had to be out of the loop later on.

520
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,867
Most of the plants
are derived from real plants

521
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,954
you would find in Madagascar,
although they are stylised.

522
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,417
But, at least as important to that is
how they're placed in the jungle.

523
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:13,171
The art department
looked at a lot of reference,

524
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,506
especially like Balinese gardens.

525
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:18,259
These are gardens
in very tropical climates,

526
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:22,430
and they use the plants
that they have in that sort of climate,

527
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:26,684
and yet create these very manicured,
groomed spaces.

528
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:33,399
And we use that idea to give this jungle
a sort of structure.

529
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:36,527
lt wasn't supposed to be
a literal version of Madagascar

530
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:41,199
but kind of stylised, using plant designs.

531
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:44,869
But to make it kind of an innocent,
naïve version of a jungle,

532
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,704
a kind of childlike view.

533
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:52,377
To place 900 dancing lemurs in a jungle
is quite an undertaking for a computer.

534
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:55,922
This is one of the scenes where
we really wanted to show the wildlife

535
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,758
and one of our editors, Clare De Chenu,

536
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,886
found this piece of music
called Move lt, that would...

537
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,181
And to kind of give these characters
a personality

538
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:09,352
we thought, like, ravers at a party.
That's how they like to live.

539
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:12,105
And this Move lt song is from the '80s.

540
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:15,608
And Sacha, who is playing Julien,
heard this music

541
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:19,070
that was just in the background
and decided he'd like to sing it.

542
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:22,573
So he went home and practised it.

543
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,535
Came back in
and he just blew the doors off it.

544
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,831
Plus he danced on videotape,
which the animators referenced.

545
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:33,626
And really gave the introduction
to the locals a great flavour.

546
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,420
And we introduced the foosa.

547
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,588
Yeah, it was a stroke of genius

548
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:42,593
to cast Sacha Baron Cohen
as our lemur king.

549
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:46,055
Leslee Feldman and her crew
suggested him to us.

550
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,392
And we'd actually
never heard of him before,

551
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:53,104
but then saw the work he'd done
on HBO with Ali G.

552
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,606
-And he could create characters.
-Yeah.

553
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,984
He came in
and played around with some voices,

554
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,611
kind of this lndian,

555
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:03,948
came up with a French,
kind of lndian accent.

556
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:08,744
And then after a few sessions really
gave it it's own kind of flavour.

557
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:11,497
We don't know what it is,
what that accent is.

558
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:15,334
So this was hard to set up,
a challenge for us to set up.

559
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,295
You know, the locals
and what they're like,

560
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:22,425
and their enemy, the foosa,

561
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,635
and kind of their situation.

562
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,973
And to introduce the New Yorkers
to the locals as well.

563
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,893
Mort, he's one of my favourite
characters.

564
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:35,897
We've been told
he's very popular in Japan.

565
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:39,901
-Andy Richter.
-Andy Richter as the voice of Mort.

566
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,652
He's so funny.

567
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:45,573
Cedric the Entertainer
is the voice of Maurice,

568
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,991
sort of the second in command.

569
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,202
He's a kind of lemur called an aye-aye,

570
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,496
this very bizarre exotic creature

571
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,624
that lives in Madagascar
and nowhere else.

572
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:58,503
Cedric just has this
wonderful warmth to his voice.

573
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:01,005
You know, when we began,

574
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:05,301
we thought we might
try to get Malagasy accents

575
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,262
for our characters
that live in Madagascar.

576
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:14,894
But we soon realised that the best thing
is to use these beautiful voices

577
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,188
that our actors can bring to the table.

578
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:21,901
Cedric just has all of this warmth
and this mellow tone to his voice.

579
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,196
lt's a great contrast to King Julien,

580
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,158
which is what we wanted,
these two to kind of be a contrast.

581
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,869
And, yeah, we needed that,

582
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,871
someone who had brains
in the organisation

583
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:36,040
who could play against this child king.

584
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,125
The locals, because of these guys,

585
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:41,212
were very small characters
in the original version,

586
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:45,716
and their parts just grew tremendously
because of Cedric and Sacha

587
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:48,511
adding so much to them.

588
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,763
ln some of these scenes
we had a lot of dialogue

589
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,766
between Maurice and Julien
in the bushes that was really funny.

590
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,142
A lot of it was improv.

591
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:58,479
Some of those things, for time,
you have to lose.

592
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,154
The animators having fun with how...

593
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:11,826
Sacha used to hold his hands
in all these crimped shapes

594
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:16,330
when he'd perform, and the animators
tried to add that to his character.

595
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,459
There was a waterfall
actually behind them

596
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:24,338
that we didn't have the water
quite ready for yet.

597
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:28,301
And so we didn't turn on the water
for the shot.

598
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,344
So all the things weren't quite built yet,

599
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:34,015
but enough to have the scene
come across.

600
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,517
So we had to plan out what scenes

601
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:40,021
were best to animate first
with what sets are finished.

602
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,363
So cute. This is great.

603
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,658
Jada turns on
her motherly charms here.

604
00:40:56,121 --> 00:41:00,666
Originally the joke for Mort was

605
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:03,836
that he was the most annoyingly cute
of all the lemurs.

606
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,380
Remember, you always thought
it was great

607
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:09,592
that he was 37 years old in reality,

608
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,969
and that's why it was so annoying.
Act your age.

609
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:16,515
We had a joke,
where they called him on his age,

610
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,976
and he just giggled.

611
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:22,229
-And we lost that.
-Had to cut it for time, l think.

612
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,860
You know, when we started this film,

613
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:33,240
putting five furry lemurs on-screen
was the most they could do.

614
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:37,828
And there you see,
there's a few more than five.

615
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:41,082
And so that was the challenge to,
you know,

616
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:45,586
how to get all these characters
on-screen at once with all their fur.

617
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:49,131
Every one of these characters
has millions of hairs on him.

618
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:53,678
And every one of those hairs,
and its associated data,

619
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:57,515
has to be pumped
through the computers

620
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,891
to create these images.

621
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,185
So it just becomes monumental,

622
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,939
the amount of information
that has to get calculated,

623
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,149
to create these furry guys.

624
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,907
-This is a...
-Ad-lib.

625
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:19,203
-lt's always challenging in these...
-Yeah "ripping our limbs off."

626
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:27,253
This is a little bit that Sacha had done

627
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,754
where to punish Maurice

628
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,258
he calls everyone
to prepare the spanking machine.

629
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:35,136
They all cheer and...

630
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,346
But before the spanking machine,

631
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:40,683
they ask them their names
and it's a little funny bit

632
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,146
that we ended up losing, again,
to keep it moving.

633
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,452
So it's always a challenge with these,

634
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:03,622
like a nine-foot-tall lion
or a 1 5-foot giraffe

635
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:08,461
to be in the same scene
with an 1 8-inch lemur, you know.

636
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,880
Cinematically
it's very challenging sometimes.

637
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:14,341
lt was hard enough just keeping Melman
in the shots with his friends,

638
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:17,595
much less
adding these little guys to the mix.

639
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,264
That's why it was fun
to have Melman's head

640
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,933
kind of drop into the frame
from time to time.

641
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:25,603
lt sometimes came off pretty funny.

642
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:33,986
That's another ad-lib,
"fuzz bucket," very funny.

643
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,260
Beautiful sunset lighting here.

644
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:02,807
When we started the film, a lot of it
was going to take place on a beach.

645
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:06,477
We didn't think about things
like kicking sand and footprints

646
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,313
and the history of footprints and all
these little things

647
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,650
that add so much to the realism of it.

648
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:18,405
l mean, these guys, a lot of the artists
just really invented ways to do this

649
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,824
that it really adds so much.

650
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:22,701
And make you feel like
you're on a beach.

651
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:31,293
That was an ad-lib from Chris Rock.

652
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:33,587
He just started singing that song

653
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:37,466
and he really didn't know the words,
so he starts going...

654
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:42,763
And inspired that little
acrobatic gymnastics that Marty does.

655
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,106
This scene actually came
after the crates went overboard,

656
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,776
and, in the film,
with the penguins celebrating.

657
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,697
The characters are overboard,
it's dramatic,

658
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:02,533
and you cut back and the penguins
are having champagne.

659
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:08,289
We found a better place
for that little penguin celebration.

660
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:15,629
lt was a great image, l think, with
Melman in his grave, sort of giving up.

661
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,094
His giraffe crate is a headstone.

662
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:25,347
A little thing
about the will in the sand is that

663
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:28,225
the art department
had researched a New York State will

664
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,519
and all the legalese and how it's written

665
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:33,731
and actually wrote it,
modelled it in the sand.

666
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,734
Yeah, that's a legal,
binding document there.

667
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:37,985
lt's legit.

668
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,241
This little Melman ad-lib here.

669
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:51,040
David Schwimmerjust came up
with that. lt's very funny.

670
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:55,920
lt just gives the animators
so much material to work with,

671
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:58,005
these great performances.

672
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:05,721
David made Melman
just such a wonderful character.

673
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:11,101
He's so appealing, you know,
even with his phobias and weaknesses.

674
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:14,104
We didn't want him to be a downer,
we wanted him to be a lot of fun.

675
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:17,775
A loveable hypochondriac,
which he did so well.

676
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:21,946
When we tested it, they asked kids
who their favourite character was,

677
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,198
and this little boy raised his hand
and said,

678
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,951
"l like Melman, because he's too tall."

679
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:28,535
He's too tall!

680
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,207
Which is great,
'cause he is too tall, poor guy.

681
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,210
So the kid
was really empathizing with him.

682
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:46,637
And this is where we start to go
into the survival montage.

683
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:50,432
We tried so many
different types of music,

684
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:53,978
songs that would underlie it.

685
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,191
We were really stuck on it, and then
Hans decided he wanted to take a shot

686
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,902
at just composing something

687
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:06,699
and it really hits every beat of this
and the attitudes of the characters.

688
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:08,492
He really did a great job,

689
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:11,662
building it to this climactic,
monumental moment

690
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,914
with the Statue Of Liberty.

691
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,010
lt was a great idea Tom came up with,

692
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:29,471
that they construct their own version
of the Statue of Liberty,

693
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:32,975
that they could use
the Liberty's torch as a beacon.

694
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:46,238
Which led into
another storyboard artist's

695
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,033
Planet Of The Apes reference,

696
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:52,036
which kind ofjust
seemed to work right into this.

697
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,666
We do have a lot of shameless
film references in Madagascar

698
00:47:57,751 --> 00:48:00,544
and we just think they're funny.

699
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:04,006
And usually, though,
what we'll try to do is give it a test

700
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,091
that, if it works
even if you don't get the reference,

701
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:08,761
if it makes sense to some degree,

702
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,973
within the context, then it's okay.

703
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,852
Yeah, we had him
doing the Tom Hanks bit here,

704
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,772
but we just thought
it was too much CastAway.

705
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:24,651
So we kind of took
out the "l make fire" bit.

706
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,406
-Fire is very difficult.
-ln computer animation.

707
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:34,495
This was a monumental task to do
the effects here of this right here.

708
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,831
And breaking apart like this.

709
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,755
We had a lot of extra material
in this sequence.

710
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:48,383
Some of it was animated, l believe,
between Marty and Alex.

711
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,636
Mireille was great. We had...

712
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,973
This sequence was probably,
you know, felt like 1 5 minutes.

713
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:58,685
And Mireille was really good about
saying,

714
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:02,439
this bit's good, this bit's good,
you could really tighten it up.

715
00:49:02,524 --> 00:49:06,568
lt was like pulling teeth, but we're
so glad we did tighten that sequence.

716
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:09,655
-Thank you, Mireille.
-Mireille Soria, our producer.

717
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:18,205
We always wanted to have this scene
in the plane, which is good,

718
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:21,375
and the comments like maybe
the skeleton hand would be too dark.

719
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:25,462
But we just thought it was funny,
and hopefully it ended up funny.

720
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:29,299
So we put smiles on
the skeleton's faces so it wouldn't be...

721
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:32,553
There's one right there.
So it wouldn't be too gruesome.

722
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:35,931
We wanted it to be
like a little tree house kind of scene.

723
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:42,146
lt's great that the skeleton hand
sort of does the right poses.

724
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:50,821
There's Teemo that goes into the ball.
l wish we had used Teemo more.

725
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,825
-lt's a tenrec.
-lt's an actual animal,

726
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,786
all these animals are,
but Teemo was funny.

727
00:49:57,871 --> 00:50:02,166
He used to have this French accent
and had a bigger role early on,

728
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,501
but it was reduced
to popping into a little ball now.

729
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:06,545
We had a bigger role for Masacoro,

730
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,423
which is that chameleon
that you see occasionally.

731
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:13,510
She was a psychic
and she would stick her tongue out

732
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:17,514
onto people's forehead
and change colours like a mood ring.

733
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,184
And she read their fortunes to them.

734
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:33,322
Again, Sacha, just going off.
He would go off for minutes.

735
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:35,991
There'd be one line of dialogue
and he'd go off for 1 0 minutes,

736
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,827
having imaginary conversations
with other lemurs,

737
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:41,705
and we'd just be in tears, just laughing.

738
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:56,011
Sacha, there's certain words
he would say that Julien wouldn't know,

739
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,471
he's not smart enough to know,

740
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,682
so he came up with a language

741
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,893
tailored to someone
who wasn't so bright,

742
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:06,396
and it added a lot to his character.

743
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:08,732
That was the second place
we say Madagascar.

744
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:12,277
And that's about all
we wanted to mention originally.

745
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:37,886
So wouldn't you know,
this is one of those moments,

746
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:42,391
Alex and Marty connect,
you know, kind of intimately.

747
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:45,477
lt felt like it was a good point in the film.

748
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,275
Hans Zimmer brings this
friendship theme back in here.

749
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,695
Yeah, which really helps out
moments like this.

750
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:07,833
This is a long shot.
The animator took a lot of time.

751
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:09,960
Some subtle performances.

752
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:29,146
Another story artist idea
that just kind of adds to the shot,

753
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,732
that help sign falling.

754
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:36,653
So even though they're in the wild
and Marty, you know...

755
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:41,491
We wanted to have them live like,
you know,

756
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:43,660
like New Yorkers
even though they're in the wild.

757
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:47,748
So we thought it was funny
to have this apartment door scene,

758
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,251
with the chains and everything.

759
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:55,964
This kind of reuniting moment,

760
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:59,009
and then just have
a free-standing door it was funny.

761
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:02,596
Again the sound effects guys
adding extra locks

762
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,183
and so Marty has like
20 locks he undoes,

763
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,268
and that adds a bit to it.

764
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:14,441
He's using sort of a Tiki lounge
concept as a reference here.

765
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:18,195
Marty has this sort of
'60s bachelor pad, l guess.

766
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:22,115
And then Hans goes,
"l must do that music."

767
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,286
And he really nailed that genre
of bachelor pad.

768
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,001
Here come our spit takes.

769
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:36,463
So this is one where we had a few
and thought they were funny.

770
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:39,925
The problem was
we didn't have enough,

771
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,427
so we added more.

772
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,365
ln the issue of food,
they're so pampered in a zoo,

773
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,784
we're like, "Well how can we..."

774
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:10,247
They wouldn't know what to look for
to find food, you know.

775
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:13,208
They didn't even know
food grows on trees.

776
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,252
So they're kind of helpless
in this environment

777
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:16,711
being naïve about the wild.

778
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:21,633
And this is a good way
to show the herbivores

779
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,552
are okay with this stuff,

780
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:27,055
but Alex needs his steak.

781
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,057
So it was a moment we could put in

782
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:32,269
where Alex
really starts to get hungry here.

783
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:56,710
And Alex is hungry for steak.
lt was always thought...

784
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,212
lt was always a moment for him
to have this dream.

785
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:02,007
We tried different versions
of these different dreams.

786
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:06,261
One was based off Jurassic Park
where there are steaks running around

787
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,973
in flocks and herds on a big savannah.
And then...

788
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:15,479
We had a big dance number,
with all the steaks sort of...

789
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:18,440
Another Busby Berkeley musical,

790
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:24,738
and again, the story artists had come up
with this idea,

791
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,031
based off the movie.

792
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:29,618
But it was just a real simple quick way
we could convey

793
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:34,664
and have a little joke about it,
that Alex loves steak.

794
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:38,084
Rob Koo, one of our board artists,
added him doing a steak angel,

795
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,337
which he then added to that.

796
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:46,676
We actually added these cutbacks
so that we could extend this moment,

797
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,887
make it very uncomfortable.

798
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:58,522
lt sort of cracks me up
that Marty kind of buys it.

799
00:55:58,606 --> 00:55:59,773
Yeah.

800
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:02,817
Hey, what do you know?

801
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:19,668
Just the cadence of Sacha's voice
make me laugh.

802
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:31,096
Yeah, it's the Greek chorus up there
commenting on Alex.

803
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,934
The locals are desperate.
They need some kind of help.

804
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,604
Just blabbing on.

805
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,816
This was quite challenging to do this.

806
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,026
lt's really funny on paper
when it's a drawing,

807
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:49,823
all these lemurs pulling into this tree,
but to actually do it is very difficult.

808
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:57,581
ln traditional animation all you need
to do is draw it and paint it.

809
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:02,043
ln the computer world
though you have to build it.

810
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:07,090
And on that gag
and this one coming up here,

811
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,968
we adjusted the timings on those
over and over again

812
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,804
trying to find the perfect rhythm.

813
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:20,270
The one time we could say "suck."

814
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:24,941
The gag really is credited,
that little bit, to Bob Saget,

815
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:29,029
who was actually in the studio
at the time.

816
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:33,450
We showed him the penguin stuff
and he goes,

817
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:37,954
"At the end you have them on
an icy shelfjust looking at each other

818
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:39,205
"and says, 'Well this sucks."'

819
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,708
That was going to be
after the credit roll.

820
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,836
And we found a better place.

821
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,298
Well, yeah. As the penguins
became more a part of the story,

822
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:52,969
we couldn't end with them in Antarctica
so we could just move that gag up.

823
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:01,353
One of the underlying themes here
is that these guys are all...

824
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:05,482
Everybody's looking for a place
that will tell them who they are.

825
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,486
Ultimately they all have to look
inside themselves

826
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:12,405
to find who they are,
and it doesn't matter where they are.

827
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,116
They don't have to be
where Mother Nature tells them to be

828
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:17,035
or New York or anything else.

829
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,622
So the penguins again
are a parallel to that idea.

830
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:24,668
Here Marty finds
the real version of his mural

831
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:27,879
and thinks that that's all he needs
to be happy.

832
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,175
But Alex is a good enough sport
to go along

833
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:35,053
after their reconciliation on the beach.

834
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,935
This was a challenge too.
Alex is hungry now. How do we get...

835
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:46,231
We wanted Marty
to bring this kind of wild side out.

836
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:53,029
We thought if we could get him
into that chase kind of situation,

837
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:56,449
a game of tag, that Alex's instincts
would somehow kick in,

838
00:58:56,617 --> 00:59:00,286
between the hunger
and just the act of chasing his friend.

839
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:04,040
We didn't necessarily
have that dream sequence

840
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:06,084
at the beginning of the film

841
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:09,045
until we were sort of working on ideas
for this sequence.

842
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:13,883
We found that there's this opportunity
to set up that idea at the beginning,

843
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:20,181
and then allow this to sort of resonate
with what we saw when the film started.

844
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:31,192
There's a similar shot
to Marty's fantasy.

845
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:37,782
So now Alex's pupils have changed.

846
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:42,954
He's transitioned
into something closer to a wild cat,

847
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:47,000
something's flowing inside of him
that he's never felt before.

848
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:52,881
We wanted to have something for Alex
that would show

849
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:55,759
like when he's a little bit crazed
and more wild,

850
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:59,095
so his pupils shrank as his irises grow.

851
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,640
And then there's three wigs also
to kind of show

852
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,851
how he would progress
and get a little wilder.

853
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,186
Here's the next version of his hair,

854
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:10,774
which isn't
quite as blow-dried as normal.

855
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:15,862
And his whiskers
start to get little kinks in them as well.

856
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:20,241
Look how he just throws this lemur.

857
01:00:24,914 --> 01:00:26,748
Animators having fun.

858
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:32,378
This is a great example of Sacha
coming up with alternate wording.

859
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,343
"ln a very good working..."

860
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:41,304
lt was something like,
"My plan is working excellently,"

861
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:45,558
in the script, and he turned it
into words that Julien would say.

862
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:03,076
We used to have this long scene
where Alex was sniffing Marty,

863
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,496
with that wild look on his face and
didn't know what smelled so good.

864
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:10,917
Thought he smelled steak and he...
His nose kept leading him to Marty.

865
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:22,262
Sort of a variation on the song
that we heard

866
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:24,472
when Alex was at the zoo,

867
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:28,685
with kind of a crazy,
marching band feel to it.

868
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:37,402
And once Julien's character was,
you know, challenged by another king,

869
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:40,446
he became kind of bitter about Alex.

870
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,532
And there was a lot more of that,

871
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:46,077
but then we kind of
pulled back on that, because...

872
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:49,414
A beautiful waterfall back there
through these scenes

873
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,875
that we had turned off earlier.

874
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:01,175
So it was how to show Alex going nuts,
and his point of view.

875
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:05,555
And, you know, gotta give credit to
older cartoons

876
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:10,727
that would turn someone into a sucker,
you know, and cross-dissolve.

877
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:14,063
Although it would've been great to see
little steaks dissolve.

878
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:16,733
Kind of visually could show it.

879
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:20,403
Originally the steaks were realistic,
and looked kind of creepy,

880
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:23,031
so we had to stylise those a little bit.

881
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:27,493
So a moment of lucidity there
as his eyes go back to normal briefly.

882
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:35,501
Yeah, as Tom was saying,
these steaks allow us to do this,

883
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:39,881
to present this idea comedically.
lt could be very dark,

884
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:42,842
this idea
that Alex wants to eat his friends.

885
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:46,596
Which isn't something that we all can
necessarily relate to in a way,

886
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,600
so we had to play it kind of light,
that part of it,

887
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:54,896
but hopefully play that it's a real
emotional heartbreak for these guys,

888
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,982
'cause they don't think
they can be friends.

889
01:02:58,067 --> 01:03:00,234
Everything's coming out in the open.

890
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,779
There was a scene
that we actually took out.

891
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:08,409
lt was Maurice like a car salesman,
showing all the attributes of a lion.

892
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:13,373
The teeth, the claws, built for speed,
four-wheel drive.

893
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:16,125
lt was a very funny scene,
but at this point in the film,

894
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,212
you kind of knew what a lion was about,

895
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:23,466
and so it just kind of slowed down
the sequence.

896
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:29,305
lt was great working
with this layout team

897
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:32,350
to find really inventive ways
to do the storytelling

898
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:35,269
and to emphasise certain emotions,
where you put the camera.

899
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:37,438
And you try and think of it
like a live action film.

900
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:42,610
You have these miniature sets built
and these performers within that,

901
01:03:42,695 --> 01:03:47,907
and it's all a virtual world, but you
do have cameras and lenses and lights

902
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:50,743
and there are creative people working
those elements

903
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:53,830
like you would in a live action film.

904
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:57,834
So it's a really neat
and challenging process

905
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:02,922
and there's a lot more to it creatively
than most people imagine, in animation.

906
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:24,944
There's an entire department that just
constructs all the models for us.

907
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:28,031
What makes these films interesting is
every film can have its own style,

908
01:04:28,115 --> 01:04:30,950
and we wanted
to definitely have our own style.

909
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:34,454
Kendal pushed a lot of the design,
you know, so it's very unique.

910
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:39,125
So in a way we couldn't borrow
a coffee table from the Shrek universe

911
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:43,546
because it's a different style
of how it's made and graphically.

912
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,300
So, every little thing you see,
every prop, every blade of grass,

913
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:51,137
everything has been made from scratch
for this movie alone.

914
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:16,496
We have this Wonderful World song
you've seen in many films,

915
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,290
to contrast
what the characters are going through.

916
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,125
We'd used it for such a long time

917
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:25,630
we couldn't find anything better
to play with this montage,

918
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:29,926
which is virtually created
from Rob Koo, l think.

919
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:34,097
He storyboarded all these characters
kind of walking through

920
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:38,601
and each one getting picked off
by a different predator later on.

921
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,395
So it was pretty funny.
lt just kind of grew from there

922
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,775
and then we added Alex
building his cage,

923
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:49,779
because he was so afraid
about hurting his friends.

924
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:52,907
With the foosas it's very difficult,
you know,

925
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,535
'cause we went back and forth.

926
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:58,246
Do they talk?
What do they say when they talk?

927
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:01,124
And for a while they did.

928
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:06,420
We found that we didn't need them
to communicate so much,

929
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,047
but just to be savage,

930
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:11,884
and to reflect
where Alex would actually go to,

931
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:15,930
this non-speaking,

932
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:19,308
guttural, savage creature.

933
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:20,810
Little ducky.

934
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,354
We were going to have him say,
"Are you my mommy?" to Marty

935
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:27,650
before he gets eaten,
but that just went a little too far.

936
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,281
We reveal what Alex was constructing.

937
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:35,908
The Tsingy, it's actually in Madagascar.

938
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:39,328
lt's a really unique place
of limestone spires

939
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:43,040
we thought it would be great
to play out the scene there.

940
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:21,787
Jada again being the strong female
and she's just great.

941
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:24,832
l mean, she has this kind of...

942
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:28,461
When she walks into a room,
her presence is there.

943
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:31,130
Jada is very petite in reality,

944
01:07:32,758 --> 01:07:36,302
but she has this
great presence about her.

945
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,314
Animator had fun again here.

946
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:52,818
We always try to give them a
lot of freedom to go crazy with this stuff.

947
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,450
lt's one of those things that worked out

948
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:02,286
with our friends
coming back from Antarctica.

949
01:08:02,371 --> 01:08:07,333
We wanted to have the boat come back,
so they see their opportunity to leave,

950
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:11,587
but it was nice to be able
to bring the penguins back at this time.

951
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:31,023
Every shot just has
ocean in the background.

952
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:35,027
One of these shots coming up right here

953
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:38,781
has 1 5,000 trees, right here,

954
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:42,159
with four million blowing leaves

955
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:45,121
that they created just for that one shot.

956
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:48,749
And the effects team was just like,
"We want to do this shot,"

957
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:52,044
and we're so grateful to them
for pulling it off.

958
01:08:55,382 --> 01:08:58,301
That was a line that Tom
just invented on the fly as a joke.

959
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:01,387
We never thought
we'd use it at the time,

960
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:04,432
and then we were listening to takes
and we said, "Wait a minute,

961
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:06,600
-"we should try and blend this in."
-Can we say that?

962
01:09:06,685 --> 01:09:08,811
Kill them and eat their liver?

963
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:12,982
We decided we could say it
as long as we were sure he was joking.

964
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:29,457
The Skipper is barking off these orders,
and the scene was animated.

965
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:33,169
They get the locals to help them.

966
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,171
That's why that Skipper line
was still in there.

967
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:38,424
The hearts and minds of the natives.

968
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:42,345
But we changed the sequence
and they're no longer part of it.

969
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:49,560
These signs really helped us.
You know, it's maybe cheap to do that,

970
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:53,189
but we knew which side of the island
was which, in a way.

971
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:55,316
lt's in our tone still.

972
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:09,872
Here it kind of borders on creepy
with all these smiling steaks.

973
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:13,709
l remember the sound guys put in
the sound of goats and little children,

974
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:17,671
and we were going, "Wait a second,
this isn't Silence Of The Lambs. "

975
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:24,553
They were really fun to work with,
these guys. Really creative.

976
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:27,807
Chris and Ben did a great job
with the performances here.

977
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:31,102
This is a scene though where we went,

978
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:34,063
we changed the dialogue
in subtle ways,

979
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,565
and Chris at the time
was doing the Oscars,

980
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,235
and he was really cramped for time.

981
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:42,488
And l remember we actually...
He let us come to his hotel

982
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:45,699
and we set up a suite
and recorded this stuff.

983
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:49,995
And he did
a really brilliant performance.

984
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,332
But there was a technical problem
with the audio,

985
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:56,919
and we had to animate this scene,

986
01:10:57,003 --> 01:11:00,089
we had to go back in with him
after the Oscars.

987
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:03,092
The day after, l think.

988
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:05,344
He said everybody else
was calling to congratulate him.

989
01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:08,764
DreamWorks called to say, "Hey,
can we get you back in the studio?"

990
01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:11,600
So he was great, you know,
and it's hard for the...

991
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:14,937
They have to recreate
their performances, you know,

992
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:20,109
and, luckily, our actors
were really patient to the process,

993
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,819
which can be very difficult

994
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:25,072
and sometimes that happens
where you have to redo stuff.

995
01:11:25,157 --> 01:11:27,783
We see all these
beautiful images on-screen

996
01:11:27,868 --> 01:11:30,286
that the art department helps us realise.

997
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,788
But the other side of that equation

998
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:36,000
is the work that Philippe Gluckman
and his team do,

999
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:40,880
to bring these artistic ideas to the
screen in three-dimension.

1000
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:43,632
Managing how all the effects look,

1001
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:48,387
how the surfaces look,
how the light reacts with these objects.

1002
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:52,850
lt's a huge task. Philippe and his team
have just done an incredible job,

1003
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:59,815
sometimes recreating almost exactly
what was conceived

1004
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:03,277
in the artistic development process.

1005
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,696
And then taking things to new levels too,

1006
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:09,658
often in ways
that surprised us sometimes.

1007
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:12,369
We didn't think that maybe some things
were possible.

1008
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:14,205
We'd ask Philippe
and he'd scratch his head

1009
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:15,581
and say, "Let me think about it,"

1010
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,460
and come back the next day and say,
"Yeah, we can do that."

1011
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,172
Beautiful backgrounds here,

1012
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:27,343
dark moody lighting
and the plants blowing gently,

1013
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:30,596
all help contribute to the tone.

1014
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,265
And the animation here,
it isn't as broad and whacky

1015
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:37,686
as it is in some other scenes
and has a little more subtleties.

1016
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:43,943
l think the animators did a great job
ofjust pulling off these subtle moments.

1017
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,446
And we launch into action.

1018
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:53,911
This is another little bit
we had to shorten for time,

1019
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,581
but Marty was pleading to the foosas
not to eat him

1020
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,833
because he had mad cow disease

1021
01:12:59,918 --> 01:13:03,045
and other Chris Rock
kind of standup routine

1022
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,297
as these foosa were encircling him.

1023
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:11,178
But it ended up
slowing down the action a little bit.

1024
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:28,654
Again one of the things we discovered
which was very difficult, whipped cream.

1025
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,198
Let that be a lesson to everyone.

1026
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:36,579
Massive undertaking again here.

1027
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:39,957
All these individual foosa
have to be animated by hand.

1028
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:44,253
You can't tell the computer to move
them around. lt doesn't look natural.

1029
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:45,879
The Whac-a-Mole gag.

1030
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:02,605
An amazing roar
designed by the sound effects folks.

1031
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:06,567
lt was very hard to get a real lion's roar,
we've discovered,

1032
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:09,111
because they don't really roar
for very long.

1033
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,530
They do really short little blasts.

1034
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:14,491
So the sound guys
had to create one for us.

1035
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:21,832
You know, one of the things
that made Alex savage visually,

1036
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:24,209
his teeth used to turn sharp.

1037
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:26,962
We had this second set of teeth for him.

1038
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:29,340
But it really, really looked like Alien.

1039
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:32,760
So we decided
not to use those kind of teeth

1040
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:34,345
and keep him with his normal ones.

1041
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:36,889
Usually teeth don't change anyway.

1042
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:05,501
You know, in the end,
just the sound editing,

1043
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:08,087
what H and those guys did,

1044
01:15:09,631 --> 01:15:12,341
it's really amazing
technically how this all works.

1045
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,718
With all these guys
screaming on top of each other,

1046
01:15:14,803 --> 01:15:17,137
and, you know,
they're all recorded separately

1047
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:20,349
and it takes a large amount of patience
in editing

1048
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:24,061
to string
all these vocal performances together

1049
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:28,065
and make it sound like
everyone's working with each other.

1050
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:32,820
A little funny nunchucks bit
that the animator put in.

1051
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:35,739
Really shows off
what we can do with the characters

1052
01:15:35,824 --> 01:15:38,575
and how we can move them
in a sequence.

1053
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:41,203
Our character TD's
or technical directors

1054
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,247
are the ones that set these up

1055
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:47,000
so that they can be sort of
pushed and pulled to such extremes.

1056
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:49,920
Robyn, Alain,
and the others did a great job,

1057
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:52,214
giving the animators
the handles they needed

1058
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,134
to do this kind of over the top animation.

1059
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:03,475
And Rex Grignon was fantastic
as an animation supervisor

1060
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:07,688
who really pushed the animators
and helped set the tone

1061
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,857
of the style of animation we were after.

1062
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:11,191
You can't thank those guys enough.

1063
01:16:11,276 --> 01:16:13,402
You never can,
because there's so many.

1064
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:17,239
There's probably 50 animators
that contributed to this film,

1065
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:18,574
whose work is seamless.

1066
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:23,912
Every animator has his own shot,
and they'd run right next to each other.

1067
01:16:23,997 --> 01:16:27,499
So it's amazing
how continuous it all feels afterwards.

1068
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:45,267
We decided Alex could eat fish,
since fish don't talk in our movie.

1069
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,478
-They're not.
-You can eat all the fish you want.

1070
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,605
Because a lion really can't...

1071
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:53,609
lt's impossible for them
to really live off vegetables and fruit.

1072
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:55,861
Have to have protein some way,

1073
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:59,156
so fish was our serendipitous solution
for that.

1074
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:05,120
Marty actually had teeth marks
on his butt

1075
01:17:05,205 --> 01:17:07,206
from where he was bitten.

1076
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:11,585
ln the computer it never looked right.
lt always looked really gruesome,

1077
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:14,671
with little blood specks
or a little pink thing.

1078
01:17:14,756 --> 01:17:15,923
lt didn't look right.

1079
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:20,803
The ultimate solution they came up with
was a Band-Aid, which works out great.

1080
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:27,226
The story artists bring a huge amount
of creativity to the table.

1081
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:31,980
They don't just get the script and draw
what's on the page necessarily.

1082
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:34,399
They use that as a guide.

1083
01:17:34,484 --> 01:17:38,737
Catherine Rader and Rob Koo
are our two lead story artists

1084
01:17:38,822 --> 01:17:41,824
and contributed
so much original material.

1085
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:43,909
Much of what you see on-screen

1086
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:47,120
was actually never in the original
script sometimes.

1087
01:17:47,205 --> 01:17:52,209
And Rob and Catherine are very much
filmmakers in their own right

1088
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:55,754
as they take these script pages,
just the written word,

1089
01:17:55,839 --> 01:18:00,092
and turn it into cinema,
along with their team of story artists.

1090
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:04,972
And the first performance
is in the drawings as well.

1091
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,600
So that's how you visualize this,

1092
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:13,105
and from there everyone else
is inspired by the storyboard drawings.

1093
01:18:16,985 --> 01:18:19,611
The crown is so small in Alex's hand.

1094
01:18:19,696 --> 01:18:21,238
"Go, Stevie, go!"

1095
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:26,034
He went to town on that so
we put that in, the gecko on his crown.

1096
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:29,580
Yeah, to fit that crown
on Alex's head was...

1097
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:33,041
And do some funky things with it,
little tricks,

1098
01:18:33,126 --> 01:18:35,043
to make him be able to wear it.

1099
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:37,629
You can barely see it, it's so tiny.

1100
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:41,383
But you know how big Julien is
compared to Alex's head.

1101
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:45,220
We got to this point and realised
we needed to let everybody know

1102
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:48,515
the monkeys were still out there.
They're still okay.

1103
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:53,395
They're back there toasting
with tea and root beer,

1104
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:58,233
until Phil smells his armpit
and is down for the count.

1105
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:03,405
We've heard that we may be
telegraphing a sequel here,

1106
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:06,199
by saying it's out of gas.
We thought it was a really funny joke.

1107
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:09,244
We had the boat
sail off into the sunset at one time,

1108
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:11,496
but it seemed very typical.

1109
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:21,798
So this is something
at the end of production,

1110
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:25,928
there's some reused animation,
but a lot of it was just...

1111
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:29,598
A lot of animators
had some time and said,

1112
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:32,893
"What's your favourite character?
You want to make him dance?"

1113
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:37,731
You have seven seconds of dance time,
so these guys really worked extra hard

1114
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:41,526
and did these little great dance numbers
with the characters,

1115
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:44,112
which kind of helps you
through the titles.

1116
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:47,783
The titles on an animated film
can be exhausting

1117
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:50,869
because there's so many people
deserving of credit

1118
01:19:50,954 --> 01:19:55,207
and so many people working on it
that's it's an amazing process.

1119
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,459
As Eric said,
that's why we have two directors.

1120
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:01,338
We could each work on separate teams.

1121
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:05,634
But Eric and l could always get together,
and with Mireille

1122
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,804
and kind of know
the film we wanted to make.

1123
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:12,516
So it was easy for us to split up
and divide and conquer in that way.

1124
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:16,269
And it sort of worked that way
with producers as well.

1125
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:19,022
Mireille would often be in one location

1126
01:20:19,107 --> 01:20:21,149
and the co-producer Teresa Cheng

1127
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:25,404
would be up at the production facility
in Northern California,

1128
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:30,742
managing the production
and all the folks

1129
01:20:30,827 --> 01:20:33,954
and the schedules that were necessary.

1130
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,164
We did it in two locations.

1131
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:39,584
We have a DreamWorks campus
in Glendale, California,

1132
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:42,421
and then one
in Redwood City, California,

1133
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,925
about an hour plane ride apart,

1134
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:50,095
and a lot of high end technology
and video conferencing systems

1135
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:54,057
that allowed us
to bridge that gap a little bit.

1136
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:58,103
Often Tom and l would find ourselves
in different locations,

1137
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,814
or Mireille and Teresa would be.

1138
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:04,651
Which was probably in a total of, like,

1139
01:21:04,736 --> 01:21:07,029
a four-year process,
four-and-a-half-year process

1140
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:09,406
of working on this film, the last third of it

1141
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:12,617
is actually in production
with all the animators.

1142
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:17,748
All these people come aboard
and help create this thing.

1143
01:21:17,832 --> 01:21:21,543
So it takes a long time
to do one of these things.

1144
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:25,088
But when you see it all done,

1145
01:21:25,173 --> 01:21:30,135
and the work everyone else has done,
it's really fantastic to see.

1146
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,430
Every one of these names
that you're seeing is actually someone

1147
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:37,059
who contributed a great deal of time
and creative energy on the film,

1148
01:21:37,143 --> 01:21:40,645
so that's a lot of them, yeah.

1149
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:44,316
And any one of them
is a tremendous artist in their own right

1150
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,359
who could go out and do beautiful work

1151
01:21:46,444 --> 01:21:50,238
without Tom and myself
telling them what to do.

1152
01:21:50,323 --> 01:21:53,658
Ourjob really is what the name says,

1153
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:57,662
direct people all in the same direction,

1154
01:21:57,747 --> 01:22:00,791
so that everybody's
telling the same story.

1155
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:05,087
We're caretakers of the story
in that sense,

1156
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:11,009
to make sure all this great creative work
is servicing that main idea.

1157
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:14,346
Ultimately it doesn't matter
how many polygons you have

1158
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:18,100
or how many people are in the crowd
or how beautiful the images are,

1159
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:22,229
if you don't have a story behind it all
that people care about

1160
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:24,189
and the characters that people love

1161
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:27,359
and care about
what's going to happen to them next.

1162
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:30,821
We get to feature
some of the great score work

1163
01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:34,032
that Hans Zimmer and his team
did here in these credits too.

1164
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:36,284
lt was great to bring
some of that music back in.

1165
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:41,039
This is a great piece.
A lot of it underscores the film,

1166
01:22:41,124 --> 01:22:44,376
but it's nice to hear it
just clean like this.

1167
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,337
This is when they were escaping
from the zoo.

1168
01:22:48,548 --> 01:22:52,843
Hans was trying to do
New York-sounding material.

1169
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:55,470
Looking at Gershwin,
trying to do his own version,

1170
01:22:55,555 --> 01:22:57,639
and then finally he said,
"What am l doing?

1171
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:00,142
"Anything l do will just be
a cheap imitation of Gershwin.

1172
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:03,019
"l'm going to come up
with my own sound for New York City."

1173
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:06,148
When he played this for us,
it just gave us chills.

1174
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:08,316
We thought it was a great piece,

1175
01:23:08,401 --> 01:23:12,237
a great way to underscore,
quite literally, what they're doing

1176
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:15,574
when they're escaping
in the streets of Manhattan.

1177
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:34,384
l think there's a montage
of penguins music coming up soon.

1178
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:39,639
That was fun to work with too,
to find that tone that sort of...

1179
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,933
These guys have this
black and white mentality,

1180
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:44,936
this sort of '50s sensibility.

1181
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:49,357
And to find music
that kind of helped sell that...

1182
01:23:50,568 --> 01:23:54,279
Originally we had crime jazz,
which had a lot of bongos in it,

1183
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:58,909
and so they latched onto
that kind of retro, detective music

1184
01:23:58,993 --> 01:24:02,162
and added their own bit to it.

1185
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:03,371
A lot of people.

1186
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,249
A lot of people, doing a lot of things.

1187
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,336
Here's some more.

1188
01:24:09,837 --> 01:24:13,715
You do these things on computers,
but there's so much support for that,

1189
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,092
and these guys don't get, you know...

1190
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:21,806
They invent ways to do new things
and make it

1191
01:24:21,891 --> 01:24:25,727
so the art of computer animation
can just keep expanding.

1192
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:29,064
Much of the software we use
is all written in-house

1193
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:32,817
and maintained by computer artists

1194
01:24:32,902 --> 01:24:35,528
and programmers in-house,

1195
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:40,075
which makes it possible for us
to do things

1196
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,868
that frankly would be impossible

1197
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:45,080
if we had to depend upon
off-the-shelf software.

1198
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:46,873
So a lot of those names you see here

1199
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,917
are helping us
achieve those sorts of things.

1200
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:53,588
Helping the departments
communicate with one another.

1201
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:56,841
lt's all about the pipeline in
something like this.

1202
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:59,761
The last thing you want is
to have teams of people

1203
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:03,390
sitting, waiting for inventory to work on.

1204
01:25:03,474 --> 01:25:07,310
So it's a monumental task
to keep that flowing

1205
01:25:07,395 --> 01:25:10,605
and a lot of these people
help with that as well.

1206
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:49,227
Here we come with our final
little goodbye from Gloria.

1207
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:52,814
Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Hope you guys enjoyed it.
