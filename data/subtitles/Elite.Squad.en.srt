1
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,583
There are over 700 slums in my city...

2
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,045
and most are ruled by drug dealers.

3
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:16,552
They carry AKs, Uzis, AR-15s...
you name iT.

4
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,597
Around the world
these guns are used for wars.

5
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,017
In Rio, they're in the hands of thugs.

6
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,901
Their bullets cut through cars like paper.

7
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,198
It's crazy to think that in a city like Rio,
cops just go into slums to enforce the law.

8
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:43,370
Cops have families.
They're afraid of dying too.

9
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,331
- Which way?
- Up here, let's go!

10
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,473
What happened here was inevitable.

11
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,686
The drug cartels and the police had
to work out ways to get along.

12
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,689
After all, nobody wants to die in vain.

13
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,736
Marcinho, here come the pigs!

14
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,198
I know. They're here for the payoff.

15
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,745
Fumaca, take them the money!
You two, cover him!

16
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,544
In Rio, peace depends
on a delicate balance...

17
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,131
between the thugs' ammo
and the cops' corruption.

18
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,386
Honesty isn't part of the game.

19
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,145
When honest cops go into slums...

20
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,189
bad shit generally happens.

21
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,673
- Are they getting out?
- Can you see Fabio?

22
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,807
- You won't need your gun.
- You're gonna leave me unarmed?

23
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,850
Get out! Get out!

24
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,061
- Can you see Fabio?
- Shut up, man.

25
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,771
Can you see him?

26
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,315
- What's going on?
- Calm down.

27
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,988
What's up Oliveira? Back again, huh?

28
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,156
Where's our money, punk?

29
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,035
Shit!

30
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,373
- What's going on?
- Hang on! Hang on!

31
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,166
- Shit!
- Is Fabio there?

32
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,585
- Shut up!
- What is it?

33
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,717
In Rio, every cop has to make a choice.

34
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,970
He either turns dirty,
keeps his mouth shut...

35
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,972
or he engages in war.

36
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,975
That night Neto and Matias
made the same choice...

37
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,729
I did ten years earlier: They chose war.

38
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,355
Who did you shoot?

39
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,274
- Who did you shoot, man?
- Let's go, dude! Move it!

40
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,444
- Shit! Who's shooting, bro?
- Two cops are up here!

41
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,573
Shit!

42
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,286
They're coming your way!

43
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,499
Shit, bro!

44
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,294
They think they can fuck with us?

45
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,088
Fuck!

46
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,847
Run!

47
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,530
- Shit!
- We're surrounded!

48
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,367
- Just keep shooting!
- We're gonna die, man!

49
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,246
Neto and Matias didn't
stand a chance of surviving.

50
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,709
Regular cops aren't trained for war.

51
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,797
I'm running out of ammo!

52
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,973
Just stay calm! Let's go in easy, guys.

53
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,352
There are a lot of people at the party.

54
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:40,065
We gotta go in carefully.
There may be cops down.

55
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,692
Me? I'm no regular cop.

56
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,571
I'm from BOPE, Rio's elite squad.

57
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,575
- Who knows this slum?
- I do.

58
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,330
- You're gonna take us in, then.
- Let's enter from the main road!

59
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,336
In theory we belong to the same force,
but actually, we're totally different.

60
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,175
Our symbol shows exactly
what we're all about,

61
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,637
and our uniform isn't blue, it's black.

62
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:14,266
Nobody goes in! None of you go in!

63
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,269
You all stay right here!

64
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:21,314
BOPE always steps in when
the regular force just can't cut it-

65
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,192
and in Rio, that happens every day.

66
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,653
They think we're dumb enough
to go in there?

67
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:35,537
My name is Captain Nascimento.
I was BOPE's Alpha Team Leader.

68
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,666
I'd been fighting this war for years
and I was getting sick of it.

69
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,336
ELITE SQUAD

70
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,252
SIX MONTHS EARLIER

71
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,173
Honey, I wanna be home with you,
but I'm working.

72
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,386
You can hear his heart beat? Let me hear.

73
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,061
Wow, it's strong... It beats so fast!

74
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,856
Honey, I gotta go back to work.

75
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,110
No, don't worry.
I'll put it in the microwave.

76
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,404
Love you too.

77
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:03,375
I'm not sure what bothered me most,
the dealers or the corrupt cops.

78
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,126
What's up, Pompeu?

79
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,712
- You bring the pieces?
- Yeah.

80
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,340
In my day the police had 30,000 men.

81
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,593
With that many guys they could
have ended the drug trade.

82
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,972
But they were badly trained
and made low wages.

83
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,641
They just didn't give a shit.

84
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,353
Fuck, man. I'd love to shoot those assholes!

85
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,105
Which ones, Captain? Just say the word.

86
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,940
Those fucking cops.

87
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,526
BOPE only had 100 men.

88
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,779
For every gun I took, 3 got sold back.

89
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,449
Number 14, let them make the drop.
We'll get 'em on the way out.

90
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,955
Sir, if I shoot the dealer,
I might hit the cop too.

91
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,208
- Both of them, huh?
- Absolutely, Captain.

92
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,461
Then squeeze the fucking trigger.

93
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:53,258
To me, those who helped dealers
were just as bad.

94
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,404
Man, I gotta admit it. I had a short temper.

95
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,038
And my life was getting
more and more complicated.

96
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,528
- Good morning.
- Good morning, honey.

97
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,200
- Let me just grab some...
- Sit down, I'll bring it to you.

98
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:04,120
No, honey, I gotta go.
I have to get to work early.

99
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,666
You just got home
and now you're going back?

100
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,881
- I hardly slept last night.
- How's the baby?

101
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,302
When I get nervous he feels it and he didn't
gain any weight last time.

102
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,891
What do you want me to do?

103
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,063
If I knew it would go on like this,
I wouldn't have gotten pregnant.

104
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,947
Bye.

105
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,325
Wait, at least take a sandwich... Beto!

106
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,913
With war, you always pay the price.

107
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,043
And when it gets too high it's time to baiI.

108
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,048
That's when I found Neto and Matias.

109
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,719
Captain Fabio: Maintenance Chief.

110
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,722
Captain Oliveira: 3rd Precinct Chief.

111
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,851
They started the same way I did,
as rookie officers at their precinct.

112
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,148
I was impressed on my first day too.

113
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,734
Welcome, Lieutenants.

114
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,155
From now on you are under my command.

115
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,576
You will be evaluated daily
by me and my men.

116
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:31,124
These officers,
which I am honoured to command...

117
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,919
in addition to being family,
are the best on the force.

118
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,007
Neto and Matias fell for the usual bullshit.

119
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:44,012
They were like angels.
But I needed someone like them.

120
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,182
Actually, I needed
a guy with the brains of one...

121
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,350
and the heart of the other.

122
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:54,522
It would have been easier
if I could've had both...

123
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,485
but who says life is easy?

124
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,112
This is where you're gonna work, Neto.

125
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,948
- This is the auto shop?
- Yeah. Is that a problem?

126
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,951
Can't you put me somewhere else?
I don't know shit about cars!

127
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:12,540
There are 46 cars and 12 motorcycles.
You need to get them all up and running.

128
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,213
- Hi, Captain.
- At ease.

129
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,132
These two are your assistants.

130
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:27,305
- Boss, car 249 will be fixed today.
- Finally, Tiao!

131
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,977
Yeah, but the parts aren't here yet,
so I took the clutch from this one.

132
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,064
But the car is brand new!
You're already taking it apart?

133
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:42,070
There's a lot of good stuff here.
I fixed two cars already this way.

134
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:46,157
Whatever, Tiao! This shit
isn't my problem any more...

135
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,742
It's the rookie's.

136
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,745
- Hello, Sir!
- Lieutenant.

137
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,915
- At ease.
- You can be at ease too.

138
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,669
- Have a sandwich, coffee, water...
- I'm not hungry.

139
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,672
Let's get to work,
I want this car back in shape today.

140
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,759
- But without parts?
- I don't care. Let's make it work.

141
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,221
Neto was impulsive,
he acted before thinking.

142
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,891
Matias thought way too much, before acting.

143
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:18,356
See that pile of paperwork? Each is
a crime that the cops didn't stop.

144
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:23,736
In Neto's hands they would turn to flames.
With Matias they would become statistics.

145
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,614
This is Lt. Matias. He's your new boss.

146
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,868
- Hi, boss.
- Lt., these are your assistants.

147
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,872
Corporal Bruno and Private Machado.
Your job is to fix the radios...

148
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,791
- and organise the reports. Got it?
- Yes, sir.

149
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,960
- Your desk is over there.
- Sorry, boss.

150
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,963
If you need anything, just let me know.
Carry on.

151
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,424
Neither of the two had my training...

152
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,927
But one of them
was gonna have to replace me.

153
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,306
Listen up, class...

154
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,061
Matias was dedicated and smart.

155
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,565
In BraziI a guy who is black and poor
doesn't get many opportunities.

156
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,568
But that didn't bother Matias.
He wanted to be a lawyer...

157
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,654
so he enrolled in Rio's best law school.

158
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,741
Get into groups of four, people!
Then choose one of these subjects.

159
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,452
Guys, I want to do the Foucault, okay?

160
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,413
There's only three of us.
We need someone else.

161
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,166
It's a privilege to have a cop like this
on the force.

162
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,668
Matias was very naive.

163
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:25,131
He thought studying the law had
everything to do with enforcing it.

164
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,761
To him, cops and lawyers
had the same mission.

165
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,181
I'm handing it in anyway.
The professor won't notice.

166
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:37,185
But to be part of my squad,
he would have to wake up to reality.

167
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,355
- Is this Sociology?
- Yeah. What's your name?

168
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,273
- Andre.
- Andre what?

169
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,777
- Andre Matias. Why?
- You're in our group, okay?

170
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,781
I'll explain in a second.
Foucault's Discipline and Punish.

171
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,952
Hi, I'm Maria. This is Dudu and Roberta.

172
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,372
To become a BOPE officer,
a guy needs to know his bearings.

173
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,713
You know the Pope is coming to Rio, right?

174
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,633
He wants to sleep at the Bishop's...

175
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,510
house next to the Turano slum.

176
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,555
And we need to guarantee
him a good night's sleep.

177
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,976
But Turano is a war zone!

178
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,144
I'll pay for a hotel room
in Copacabana myself!

179
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,397
I've already tried to convince the Governor,

180
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,232
but not even God
will change the Pope's plans.

181
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,150
He's sleeping there and that's it!

182
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,737
The Pope can't hear a shot, so we
have 3 months to clean up the area.

183
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,074
- We'll go in nightly.
- Commander, are you sure about this?

184
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:39,914
If we go in every night, they'll
know we're coming. We'll be shot at.

185
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,583
- People will die, Commander!
- Nascimento!

186
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,921
We start tomorrow. Is that clear?

187
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,007
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.

188
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:58,266
The Pope had already been
to Rio twice before.

189
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,395
Didn't he know
how things worked around here?

190
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,524
No politician wants to see the Pope
take a bullet in his city.

191
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,776
If His Holiness wants
to sleep close to a slum,

192
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,029
what do you think
the Governor's gonna do?

193
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,449
Take that kind of risk?

194
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,202
Of course not. The Governor
would call on BOPE.

195
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,878
Neto, cut it out. I'm trying to study here.

196
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,133
Stop it for a while. Let's go for a ride.

197
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,302
Are you using your car tomorrow?

198
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,889
- What do you need it for?
- I'm going to the Prazeres slum.

199
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,640
Are you crazy?
Why are you going to a slum?

200
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,144
The guys at school run a NGO,
and our study group is meeting there.

201
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:47,648
They'll kill you there, man, you're a cop.

202
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,985
Neto, take it easy.
Nobody at school knows I'm a cop.

203
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,155
Be careful, man.

204
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,494
The Pope needed BOPE.

205
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,121
BOPE needed me...

206
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,749
and I needed a replacement.

207
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,667
It wasn't going to be easy.

208
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,588
I was gonna have to keep going
into slums just because of the Pope.

209
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:14,759
But I'd go in wearing black
and packing guns.

210
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,144
I didn't have a problem
with Matias studying.

211
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:30,441
The problem was he didn't realise
a cop isn't like any other student.

212
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:35,029
Hi Andre! I'm so glad you came.

213
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,533
This is Rose... and Elena.

214
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,701
He's much cuter than the other one.

215
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,620
You're frisky today, Rose!

216
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,622
Well, this is what I came for...

217
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,708
Boy, don't you stare now. Bye!

218
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,171
Sorry to make you come
all the way over here.

219
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,051
This is the office... and this is Rodrigues.

220
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,719
Rodrigues... Andre.

221
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:05,935
He represents the Senator who funds us
and he's a good friend of mine.

222
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,188
Do you have a candidate yet?
Well, now you do!

223
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:13,734
Senator Magalhaes. Number 4-5-1.
Take some to hand out.

224
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,905
5 minus 4 is 1. 4 plus 1 is 5. Don't forget!

225
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,825
It's hard to resist.

226
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,453
Who wouldn't want a pretty,
rich girI with good intentions?

227
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,248
Who wouldn't want to get in her crowd?

228
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,959
Hi, Romerito! This is Andre.

229
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,253
But a cop needs to know his limits.

230
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:37,216
- Maria, can we go to the arcade?
- Not today. I have work to do.

231
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,219
- Don't you have homework?
- Yeah, but I'll do it later.

232
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,930
But you promised you were going to study!

233
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,892
- I know.
- After rehearsal, go home. Ok?

234
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,768
- Okay.
- Now, go back to class.

235
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,771
- Is he having trouble in school?
- He's not doing so well.

236
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,733
- Do you know why?
- He doesn't like to study...

237
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,901
Maybe that's not it.

238
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:59,155
I don't know how Matias didn't see
the shit he was getting into.

239
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,117
I mean, you can't be a cop
and be part of the cooI crowd.

240
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,998
So... to Foucault,
the power structure shapes the law.

241
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,293
It's not under a social contract,

242
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,921
you know?

243
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,467
Power institutionalises mechanisms...

244
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,304
...to discipline and punish criminals...

245
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,808
...like in the jail systems of the past...

246
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,186
I'm so stoned, man.

247
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:34,315
...historically such institutions
are how the state enforces...

248
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:38,653
- Here, Andre.
- No thanks. I don't like it.

249
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,404
- Just a hit?
- No thanks.

250
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,698
Pass it over, Roberta.

251
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,494
- So, that's basically all I got.
- This is good shit!

252
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,997
You did a great job!

253
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,374
The project's due next week.

254
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,628
- Did you do your part, Dudu?
- Yeah, right.

255
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,298
Matias shouldn't have been there.

256
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:04,679
But since he was, he should have
busted those kids under law 6368.

257
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:10,685
He had just started law schooI and
already was looking the other way.

258
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,478
- Hey, guys!
- What's up?

259
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:19,235
- I think we did a good job.
- Romerito...

260
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,655
- weren't you going to study?
- Yeah...

261
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,574
- Look, he missed!
- Yeah, he can't even see the ball!

262
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,829
- Let me take you home.
- Just a second.

263
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,123
- Can I see your hand?
- What are you doing?

264
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,916
I think these kids are right.

265
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,337
Look the other way, kid. C'mon.

266
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,258
OK. Let's see if you're smart.
What letter is this?

267
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,636
- It's an "A"...
- Great. That's right.

268
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,724
- Now, what letter is this?
- I dunno... what is it?

269
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,559
- It's also an "A"...
- Really?

270
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,938
The kid needs glasses. Didn't you notice?

271
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,482
You think that's why he's doing badly?

272
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,569
I had the same problem when I was his age.

273
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,237
Let's go tell your mom.

274
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,532
- Come with us, Andre.
- Where? Up there?

275
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:12,413
To become a BOPE captain,
Matias had to learn to be unforgiving.

276
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,124
Just like the dealers.

277
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:19,587
They won't make fun of you
and you'll get good grades.

278
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,256
Hey Tinho, Bica... What's up?

279
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,509
- Hey, I took that test.
- Did you pass?

280
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,680
- Piece of cake.
- See? Studying makes a difference...

281
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,017
Don't worry about going up.
The guys here are socially conscious.

282
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,727
You can relax.

283
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,772
- Hey, wassup?
- Bye, Roberta!

284
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:43,569
- Glasses are for nerds.
- But look, Andre wears glasses too!

285
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:48,366
- Maria, I gotta go.
- Why, Andre? So soon?

286
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,786
I'll be late returning my friend's car.

287
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,412
That's too bad.

288
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:57,124
I'll take the kid to buy glasses
another day.

289
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,378
No, Andre, we'll take care of it.

290
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,090
Someone helped me when I was a kid
so I want to return the favour.

291
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,967
- Okay, cool. See you!
- Bye!

292
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,640
No one starts an NGO
without the drug lord's consent.

293
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,018
That socially conscious talk
is just bullshit.

294
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,771
To me, a dealer is a dealer.

295
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,817
- What's up, Baiano?
- Hey, bro.

296
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:28,155
I know how Baiano's story ends
and I bet I know how it began.

297
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,908
He must have had a fucked-up childhood.

298
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,787
It's not an excuse, but...
that's where most dealers come from.

299
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,999
- What's up, Goldilocks?
- Looks like it snowed up here...

300
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,379
- You got the cash, man?
- Here you go.

301
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,175
Xaveco, hand me two bricks.

302
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:53,013
What's really fucked up is when kids
with money end up dealing drugs.

303
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,523
There's no excuse for that.

304
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,905
Hey, man, what's goin' on?
- Nothin' much, just chillin...

305
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,575
- Bruno! What's up, bro?
- Hey, dude.

306
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,336
- Hey.
- How are you doing, man?

307
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,047
- Marcio... I got the goods.
- Cool, bro, come on in.

308
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,717
Hey Patty, how you doin'?

309
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,514
Just a minute. I'll be right back.

310
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,104
Here it is, bro...

311
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,108
- That's all you got?
- Fuck, man!

312
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,737
- It's hard to get this much weed.
- Well, bring more next time.

313
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,576
There's two grand here.

314
00:24:56,244 --> 00:25:01,457
Get some more, dude, 'cause
people are smoking it like crazy.

315
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,002
I often ask myself how many kids
we lose to the drug business...

316
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,588
just so rich playboys can light up a joint.

317
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:12,468
Our goal is to seize all weapons.
We'll use channel 2.

318
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,056
Azevedo's team will go
by the Bishop's house.

319
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,601
- Renan's will go up Tamandare St.
- Yes, sir.

320
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,271
Nascimento, do you know 117th street?

321
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:31,278
Captain, do you?

322
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,157
I do, sir!

323
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:42,331
Well, 117 is next to the University
and is full of students.

324
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,376
I know, I told you this was a bad idea.

325
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,003
Nascimento, orders are orders.

326
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,466
We will reconvene at the centre of the slum.

327
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,010
- Understood?
- Skulls!

328
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:51,275
The strategy made sense...

329
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,445
but Operation Holiness
was just plain stupid.

330
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:59,867
But I couldn't be careless.
I was about to become a father.

331
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,912
And I didn't want to die for nothing.

332
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,589
- Stay down!
- Face the fucking ground!

333
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:59,134
- Hit the dirt!
- Stay down! Stay down!

334
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,184
Captain, are you okay?

335
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:14,024
- Where's the dealer?
- He's one of them, sir.

336
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,110
Line them up!

337
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,613
Move it!

338
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:28,956
I'm only going to ask this once!
Which one of you is the dealer?

339
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,793
Who is it?

340
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,088
- I'm just a student!
- You're what?

341
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,632
- A student!
- Just a student, huh?

342
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,970
Come over here, then. Look at your buddy.

343
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,391
Look real close. You see this hole?

344
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,852
Who killed him? Who?

345
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,479
- I dunno...
- You don't? I think you do!

346
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,982
Say it! Say it!

347
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,235
It was one of you!

348
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,739
One of us?

349
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,492
You're the one who killed him! You faggot!

350
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,537
You're the one who finances this shit!

351
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,165
You pothead piece of shit!

352
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,254
We come here to fix what you fuck up!

353
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,676
You're the ones who finance it!

354
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,095
You faggots!

355
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,348
Who's the dealer, goddammit?

356
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,606
0-7, bring the lookout.

357
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,693
Let's see...

358
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,113
Now let's see... Say it, kid!

359
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,950
Point him out! Who's the dealer?

360
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,287
Tell me right now!

361
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,873
This one, with the jacket?

362
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:59,713
Take him and the drugs to the station.

363
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,553
Captain, you OK? C'mon, let him go.

364
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,391
Now, get lost!

365
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:24,279
So, in closing, we believe
that Brazil's penal law...

366
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:29,618
...is a network of power and...

367
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:36,375
...unfortunately,
these micro power relations...

368
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,795
...end up exclusively protecting the rich...

369
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,673
...and consequentially, punishing the poor.

370
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,926
OK, good!

371
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,513
I think Maria and her group...

372
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,933
showed us that, with the abuse of power,

373
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:57,104
perverse institutions are created.

374
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:03,360
Can anyone give us an example
of such an institution?

375
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,281
- The police?
- The police. Good.

376
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,325
Tell us why.

377
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,620
We all know that when cops
go into the slums,

378
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,957
they just beat the shit out of people.

379
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:22,379
OK, Edu, so the police act perversely
against those who are poor

380
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:28,719
and compelled to commit crimes.

381
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:35,642
Professor? I hear what Edu is saying, but...

382
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:41,607
I don't think the police only act
perversely against the poor.

383
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:46,737
The middle and upper classes
are also victimised.

384
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:52,367
Maria and I were going to Buzios once
and they stopped us at a checkpoint.

385
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,454
The cops were really aggressive...

386
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,667
Did they hit you?

387
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,795
No, they pointed the guns at us!

388
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,092
Calm down, people!

389
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,803
- Go ahead.
- My father is a judge

390
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:15,599
and he said that the police go into slums

391
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:20,145
and just kill everybody,
like in the Candelaria Massacre.

392
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,941
Not only are they corrupt,
they're also cowards!

393
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,112
Calm down, folks!

394
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,742
Matias has his hand up.

395
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:38,956
Professor, everybody here has a very
superficial idea of what the reality is.

396
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:45,253
- Everyone is misinformed.
- Let him speak!

397
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:51,051
I'm sure there's corruption, but
most cops want to do honest work.

398
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,972
- Are you crazy?
- You're wrong, Andre!

399
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:05,607
Dudu's right. Who hasn't been
stopped at a checkpoint?

400
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:10,028
- It's routine here.
- No it's not!

401
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,531
They just want our money!

402
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:17,703
What I hear is that in the slums,
they shoot first and ask questions later.

403
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,204
It's not like that!

404
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,126
Let the guy finish, people!

405
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:31,299
I have a friend who's a cop,
and his best friend is also a cop

406
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,301
and they are honest guys!

407
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:37,681
I mean, sometimes
there has to be repression.

408
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,350
That's crazy, bro!

409
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,481
But you had weed on you, didn't you?

410
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,903
You have no idea how many kids die
because they start dealing weed or coke!

411
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:56,658
From your nice apartments,
you can't see that type of thing!

412
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:01,288
You're all misguided
by your stupid newspapers and TV...

413
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,004
That's it for today.

414
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,006
Mr Nascimento?

415
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,928
Were you in charge of the last operation?

416
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,848
Yes, I was.

417
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:27,773
Are you going to help me
find my son's body?

418
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:34,029
Ma'am, was your son in the drug trade?

419
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,825
Yes, sir. He was a lookout.

420
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:45,040
- We didn't kill your son.
- But you let him go, didn't you?

421
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,627
Did you think they'd forgive him?

422
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:55,217
Dealers kill lookouts who fuck up.
And... I knew it.

423
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,969
That mother made me feeI guilty,

424
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,223
and for a BOPE officer,
that's a dangerous feeling.

425
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,266
Was he your only son?

426
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,603
Yes, sir. He was.

427
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,442
It was time to find my replacement.

428
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,111
- Battery.
- OK, battery!

429
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,948
- And carburettor, boss!
- Hold on! Let him finish.

430
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:22,494
Brake disc, clutch, oil filter

431
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,788
and a cracked windshield.

432
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,124
Sir, this one needs a carburettor.

433
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,751
- Alright... carburettor...
- Yes, sir, that's right.

434
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,297
That car doesn't have a carburettor.
It's fuel injection!

435
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,424
- Does it have one or not?
- No, it doesn't.

436
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:41,721
- Listen to it! It has one!
- No, it does not!

437
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,979
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, of course not!

438
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:53,150
- It's got a fuckin' carburettor!
- It does not!

439
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:57,863
Look. Here's the carburettor, see?

440
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,116
He's right, sir, he's right.
It does have a carburettor!

441
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,745
But that's because
the original engine was replaced.

442
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,040
Look, everything's loose in here.

443
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,334
What do you mean?

444
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,880
Some cop sold the new engine
and put this old one in.

445
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,383
- Which cops did it?
- I don't know, sir.

446
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,178
Forget about it. It happens all the time.

447
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,306
The other day, someone stole a radio...

448
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:29,603
Are you guys insane?
Stealing gets you court-martialled!

449
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,899
- Yeah... right!
- Are you listening to me? Jesus!

450
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,111
If the cops had any brains,

451
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,823
they'd never let someone like Neto
be in charge of the auto shop.

452
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,867
Neto was just like me.

453
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,495
Once he got a mission,
he wouldn't give up on it.

454
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,080
What a bad call.

455
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,542
- I have a problem, sir...
- What is it? I'm in a hurry...

456
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,379
Some cop switched a new engine
with an old one, under our noses!

457
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,174
- You know who did it?
- No, but...

458
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,635
Ok, rookie. I'll ask the Commander
to open an investigation...

459
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,387
- ... and put you in charge.
- Me?

460
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,516
But I have to fix these cars
and I just need new parts...

461
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,353
Just make sure the Commander's
bike is running, ok?

462
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,272
- That's your priority!
- Yes, sir.

463
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,901
- Captain...
- What is it, rookie?

464
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,070
Here's a list of missing parts.

465
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,075
Jesus, that's a shitload of parts!

466
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:30,789
Why don't you ask Fabio for help?

467
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,457
- Sir, can't you help?
- Dismissed!

468
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:39,506
So what did the dirty cops do?
They told him to work the system.

469
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:45,136
Neto, I'll hook you up,
but don't forget my cut.

470
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:50,350
Captain, I just need to fix the cars.
I didn't join up to be a mechanic.

471
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:56,731
- Sir, where are we going?
- Just follow our usual fucking route!

472
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,734
The first time is always a good cause.

473
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,905
But once you steaI for the force
you'll also steaI for your family.

474
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,241
That's how the system works.

475
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,870
When a citizen wants a squad car
protecting his bakery,

476
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,623
or his bar, he's gotta pay.

477
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,544
I'm here for my protection fee.
Aren't you paying up today?

478
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,505
Yes, Captain. But I already settled today.

479
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:25,969
- You didn't pay me shit!
- I already paid Oliveira's guys.

480
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,762
Oliveira?

481
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:32,017
Sir, if I pay you too, I'm gonna go broke.

482
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,019
No, I'm the one who'll go broke.

483
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,938
I'm the one keeping you safe
and you pay Oliveira?

484
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,066
Deal with him, I mean,
you're on the same force, right?

485
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,777
Let's go, Neto.

486
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,946
- How much for this beer?
- It's on the house.

487
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,491
No, I'm paying. Here.

488
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:54,039
Cops ended up charging for everything-

489
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:59,544
For doing theirjobs,
and for looking the other way.

490
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,379
Hey! That guy's fining my customers.

491
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,466
I can't give you new parts
with this going on.

492
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,636
- Who gave the fucking order?
- But my parts! I need a new battery.

493
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,473
Look at him give out tickets!

494
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,893
Dude! Get over here!

495
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,229
- What's up, Captain?
- Get the fuck over here!

496
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:22,692
This area is mine.
Why are you fining everybody?!

497
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,405
- I'm just following orders.
- Whose orders?

498
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,699
- Bira's.
- Bira?

499
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,288
- Bira, get over here!
- I can't right now!

500
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,873
Here's an example...

501
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:41,086
The government was so broke,
it didn't have money to buy tow trucks.

502
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,506
So it decided to hire independent
contractors and pay per car towed.

503
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,716
Get over here!

504
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,426
Hold on!

505
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,931
Towing cars became so fucking profitable
that the system just ate it up.

506
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,601
You can't tow cars here!
This is my territory!

507
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:02,399
Captain, it's Oliveira's truck.
Here, work it out with him.

508
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,568
- What about my parts?
- Hold on.

509
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,863
Oliveira? It's Captain Fabio.

510
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:12,659
I came here to get some parts,
but I heard you've got this area now.

511
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:17,664
Commander, it's Fabio.
He's messing with our towing scheme.

512
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,499
Just clip his wings.

513
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,585
Fuck off, Fabio, it's my area now.

514
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,922
- Your area?!
- Yeah, deal with it.

515
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,299
Tell him about my parts!

516
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,803
Hello? That asshole hung up on me!

517
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,638
What about my parts?

518
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,892
Can't you at least get me a battery, man?!

519
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:46,734
- Isn't that the commander's bike?
- It's Friday, he's cashing in.

520
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,613
That's why his bike can never break down.

521
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,033
- Fuck, now I get it. Jesus!
- Yeah, we used to get our cut.

522
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,953
Now the Commander's keeping
it all for himself.

523
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:02,208
The system was so fucked up that
everybody stole from everybody else.

524
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:10,467
Sarge, my vacation is due next month.

525
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:15,889
- And my wife is taking off with me.
- How nice...!

526
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:20,685
I'd like to get the paperwork done,
so I can go.

527
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:27,233
I'm sorry but I can't do that.
I've got 40 cops ahead of you,

528
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,820
and our precinct needs you now.

529
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:36,993
Maybe I can talk to the boss
and see if he'll let you go.

530
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,663
- I'll have to do it by the book...
- But Sergeant,

531
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:45,418
I haven't taken a vacation in 4 years!

532
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,963
- You just need to do the paperwork.
- Maybe I can help you.

533
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:54,844
I want to help you,
but you need to help me help you.

534
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:01,434
Corporal Paulo, you wanna be happy?
You gotta make me happy first!

535
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,063
Am I right?

536
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,148
You gotta make me happy, man!

537
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,692
Understood, sir.

538
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,322
- Permission to leave, Sergeant.
- Granted.

539
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,951
That's a very serious accusation, rookie.

540
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:22,830
- I'm sure he tried to bribe him.
- Can you prove it?

541
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,835
If he can't prove it, it's just hearsay.

542
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,006
Rookie, just do your job and I'll do mine.

543
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,425
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

544
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,594
Dismissed.

545
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,141
Neto just wanted to work for the police...

546
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,352
but he ended up like I did...

547
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,104
working against them.

548
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,815
Sweetheart, are you going up or not?

549
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,779
Honey? Are you okay? You feeling sick?

550
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:08,293
Beto!

551
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,379
Hi. Is everything okay?

552
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:15,466
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- You sure?

553
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,438
- Fuck! I can't breathe.
- Stay calm, honey.

554
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,232
- My arm is numb.
- It's not your heart.

555
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,985
It's just stress, trust me.

556
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,705
- Nascimento, your tests are all good.
- You sure?

557
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:50,543
I have a history
of heart disease in my family.

558
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:54,047
Your heart is in good shape.

559
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:59,844
Sometimes my ears start ringing,
my hands shake...

560
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,972
Your problem's not physical.

561
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:10,897
You're under a lot of stress.
I'm sending you to the psychiatrist.

562
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,068
- Psychiatrist?
- It's harmless.

563
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,992
When Matias defended the police,
he didn't know how fucked up they were.

564
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,747
For 2 months, he studied crime reports

565
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,376
and came up with a plan to position

566
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,921
the squad cars in strategic places.

567
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:39,634
But efficiency just didn't fly
at his precinct.

568
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,262
Sometimes it seemed like stopping crime

569
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,724
was the last thing
on the Commander's mind.

570
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,103
Shit, Estevao!
This report's gonna fuck me over!

571
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,606
Twelve homicides in a month?!
I can't report this!

572
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,443
Commander, I checked his report
and it looked fine to me.

573
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,697
- You trying to fuck me over, rookie?!
- No, sir.

574
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,075
Go get Fabio, then!

575
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,287
What about these four dead bodies, soldier?

576
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,873
The report is accurate, sir.
Didn't you see the map?

577
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,875
I don't give a fuck about numerology!

578
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,129
And now the piece of shit wants to
show me where to put my cars?

579
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:21,050
When a crime was committed in our
area, the Commander had to solve it.

580
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,970
But that took hard work.

581
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,972
- You asked to see me, sir?
- Yes.

582
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,640
- Is there a problem?
- Yes.

583
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,893
I want you to explain these four
bodies found in the Tabajara slum.

584
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,772
It's not my fault.
I did everything just like you said.

585
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:39,068
Dispatch, no bodies were found
in the 19th Precinct.

586
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,822
They're in Precinct 2, copy? Over.

587
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:47,076
It's easier to move the crime scene
than to actually find the criminaI.

588
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,079
There are lots of crooked commanders
that lower their statistics

589
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,082
by dumping bodies
into other people's districts.

590
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,335
But, some nights, it was
like musicaI fucking chairs.

591
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,505
Dispatch, the bodies are actually
in the 19th Precinct.

592
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,174
You copy that?

593
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:07,013
See, Commander? I took them out,
but they brought them back...

594
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,599
- I don't want to hear it.
- But Commander...

595
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,267
- Enough!
- Yes, sir.

596
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,353
Rookie, you are going to rewrite
this report.

597
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,607
Look at this. "Body found on the beach. "

598
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,859
A death on the beach is a drowning,
son, it's not our problem!

599
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:23,029
- But there was a bullet wound...
- Are you a coroner?

600
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,698
- No, sir.
- I want a new report by Monday,

601
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:29,702
because this one... never existed.

602
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,460
If you don't talk I won't be
able to help you.

603
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,712
It's just that...

604
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,965
It's not easy to open up.

605
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,553
And I don't know...

606
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:52,475
if you're gonna report the things
I tell you here to my supervisors.

607
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:57,313
If that's the case I'd rather talk
about a friend of mine...

608
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:01,567
who's going to be a father,
and is having serious problems.

609
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:02,735
Captain...

610
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:07,740
I can't help you unless you tell me
what your problem is.

611
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,663
And this isn't a confessional.
It's the Special Ops Psych ward.

612
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,666
And, off the record,

613
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,087
if I had to report everything,

614
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,423
there wouldn't be any cops left in Rio.

615
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,553
So... make up your mind.

616
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,763
You wanna talk or not?

617
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,943
Excuse me?

618
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:47,864
Captain, I will replace you when I can.

619
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,285
I need you for the Pope's mission.

620
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,623
I gave you a task, now get it done.

621
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,627
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

622
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,130
Dismissed.

623
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,048
Call it fate, but...

624
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:09,260
the day I lost hope of leaving BOPE

625
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:15,057
was the day Neto came up with his plan.

626
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,313
- Hi, Neto.
- You got my car keys?

627
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:24,817
What are you doing, bro?
You're fucking up my map!

628
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,153
I figured out a way to fix the cars.

629
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,989
Come on, we just need to tell Fabio.

630
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,241
- What do you mean?
- Just follow me.

631
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,076
You're getting crazy!

632
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,587
I'm totally getting fucked by the commander.

633
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,505
What do you mean?

634
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:50,676
I'm broke. He's taking everything.

635
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:54,013
Oliveira's getting all my action...

636
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,349
You get a payoff from this club?

637
00:48:56,433 --> 00:49:00,186
Yeah, so what? I'm not gonna raid the slums

638
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,022
and get shot at for
a lousy 500 bucks a month.

639
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,524
I can't believe this shit!

640
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:10,446
It used to be a straight deal, man.
It used to be an honest deal.

641
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,783
But the Commander's taking it all now.

642
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:18,621
- The dealers pay him off, too?
- You're so fuckin' naive...

643
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:23,042
Didn't you notice that his men
go into that slum every week?

644
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,211
They're going in there to get his cut!

645
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,046
How much do they get with the bookies?

646
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,299
At least 6 grand a week, maybe more.

647
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:34,553
Wow, that prick's
making some serious bank!

648
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,139
I know how we can get that money.

649
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,393
- And what's my cut?
- What do you mean?

650
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,396
You want all the money for yourselves?

651
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:50,069
No! We're gonna use the money
to fix the division's cars.

652
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:54,907
- Yeah, but what's my cut gonna be?
- You want to fuck the Commander over?

653
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,994
You kidding me?
You're the ones fucking me over!

654
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:02,415
- I'm gonna go take a piss.
- Wait a minute, Fabio, wait!

655
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,672
Andre, you better not bail on me, bro.

656
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:21,350
It was perfectly timed.
It took Matias 40 minutes

657
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:25,271
to get to the Commander's
biggest payoff spot.

658
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,857
That's when Neto stepped in.

659
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:32,611
- Try it again. See if it starts.
- Hurry up, man, I'm late!

660
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,948
- Okay, just try it again...
- I'm fucking late, man!

661
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:39,535
Think it's easy? You repair it.

662
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,955
- Now I think it'll work.
- Think so?

663
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,376
I'm really late, man.

664
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,718
Shit, it's gonna take some time to fix.

665
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,429
Hurry up and call Paulo. He'll fix it.

666
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,392
By the time the guy left, Matias
had already picked up the cash.

667
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,148
How are you, Santos, feeling better?

668
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,733
What do you mean?

669
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,319
Your buddy passed by
and said you were sick.

670
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:16,489
- Me, sick?
- Yeah, I even gave him the money.

671
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,240
You what?!

672
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:22,328
He said the Commander had sent him,
so I gave him the money.

673
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,164
Son of a bitch!

674
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,999
The plan was brilliant.

675
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,795
What could the Commander do,
call the cops?!

676
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,217
Neto worked the system perfectly.

677
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:40,346
But his plan was also very risky.

678
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,725
The Commander wasn't going to
take losing his money lightly.

679
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,561
At least Neto was fighting fire with fire.

680
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,815
Matias just kept on
making the same mistakes.

681
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,608
There's Andre. Let's go talk to him.

682
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,694
- No, I'm busy.
- I'm busy, too.

683
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,489
- Okay. See you, guys.
- Bye.

684
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:07,540
- Where have you been hiding?
- Hi, Maria.

685
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:40,739
- Check out who just walked in.
- Shit! He's gonna bust us.

686
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,367
What's up, guys?

687
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,912
- Mary!
- Maria!

688
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,999
- Everything cool?
- Where were you?

689
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,626
We just lost track of time.

690
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,713
- You look so pretty.
- So do you!

691
00:52:55,797 --> 00:53:00,634
- Anyone want to dance?
- We are a little busy right now...

692
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,764
- Let's go dance.
- Alright. See you later.

693
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,062
Just because we have nice apartments!

694
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,442
Yo, I'm gonna go screw with him a bit.

695
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,445
Just don't end up screwing us over, man!

696
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:52,478
I guess someone's having fun with me.

697
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,983
But it's okay, I don't mind.
Let's keep dancing.

698
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:03,489
They tell you to obey,
they tell you to respond,

699
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:08,035
They tell you to cooperate,
and tell you to respect them!

700
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,537
Police for those who need it!

701
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,998
Police for those who need the police!

702
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,501
Police for those who need it!

703
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,128
Police for those who need the police!

704
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,840
There's too much salt,
let's add some potatoes.

705
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,511
When the Commander
found out that 2 rookies

706
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,681
had stolen his money, he couldn't complain.

707
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,016
So, he took advantage of the situation.

708
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:36,355
Matias was sent to the cafeteria.
Neto was stuck back at the auto shop.

709
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,524
What are you doing here, Paulo?

710
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:42,236
They cancelled my vacation, to teach
me not to complain about the Sarge.

711
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,947
But what about the auto shop?

712
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,407
But now without his best mechanic.

713
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,909
Want some fresh guava jam?

714
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,912
Neto, I told you this shit was gonna go bad.

715
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:57,209
The Commander was sure
they were acting on orders

716
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,879
from someone higher up
who knew the system well.

717
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,006
Fabio!

718
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,215
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.

719
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,801
- You working tonight?
- Yes, sir.

720
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:09,555
I want you to check out
a funk party at the Babilonia slum.

721
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,806
- Me, sir?
- Yeah, you.

722
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,141
- Yes, sir.
- Tonight.

723
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:15,436
- Tonight?
- Okay. Excuse me, sir.

724
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,148
But the guy the Commander
would really punish,

725
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:24,445
was the one he thought
was screwing him behind his back.

726
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,531
Sweetheart, he's moving around!

727
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,035
He's the cutest little thing...

728
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,787
Too bad you're not here.

729
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,540
I want you to listen to his heartbeat.

730
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:48,093
Every time I thought about my son,
I remembered that kid's mother.

731
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:52,598
It must be fucked up to have
to bury your own son.

732
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,074
Let's suit up, men!

733
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,869
- Where are we going, Captain?
- We are going to the Turano slum.

734
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,455
We're gonna find that lookout's body.

735
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,505
The Colonel asked me to check out
a call about a funk party.

736
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,382
The slum's calm tonight, guys.

737
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,343
If we do things right
we might get some dough.

738
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,179
Don't tell the rookie though,
he'll rat us out.

739
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,681
Hey, rookie, what the fuck
are you doing with that rifle?

740
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,184
You think you're gonna go
into the slum with me?

741
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:41,146
- You're staying right here.
- OK. I got it, no problem.

742
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:44,358
Captain, this squad's going with Cabral.

743
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,236
- The Commander said to go with them.
- No, you're coming with me.

744
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,364
Rookie, put down that rifle and
go fix the Commander's motorcycle.

745
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,491
Let's go, Fabio, hurry up.

746
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,662
Neto, did you do that thing we talked about?

747
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,706
- Yeah, why?
- Captain, let's roll!

748
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,333
Okay, I'm coming.

749
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,504
'Cause I think they're gonna kill me, man.

750
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,520
- Matias.
- What's up?

751
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,856
- The shit's hit the fan...
- What happened?

752
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,024
They think Fabio did it!

753
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,527
- What do we do?
- Come with me. Let's go!

754
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,195
- Take over, Paulo.
- But Lieutenant...

755
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,163
Get down! Get down!

756
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,081
- Can you see Fabio?
- Relax, dude.

757
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,625
- What's going on?
- Calm down.

758
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:25,876
What's going on?

759
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,296
- You're not gonna need this.
- You're gonna leave me unarmed?

760
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,715
Get out! Get the fuck out!

761
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,426
- Where's Fabio?
- Relax. I'll find him.

762
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,012
- Can you see him?
- Shut up, dude!

763
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,601
What's up Oliveira? Back again, huh?

764
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,062
Punk, where's the money?

765
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:48,857
They weren't gonna kill Fabio
right there in front of everybody.

766
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:52,402
But Neto had an itchy trigger-finger,

767
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:58,784
and the way he saw it, that dealer
was reaching for a gun.

768
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:04,957
- Who did you shoot?
- Let's get outta here!

769
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:22,975
Shit!

770
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,906
What the fuck?

771
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,837
Shit, man! The pigs went crazy!
They're shooting at each other!

772
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,718
Fucking shoot! Cover me!

773
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,137
Do something.

774
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:04,850
I'm almost out of ammo.
I only have one more clip.

775
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,146
Shit, I got his machine.

776
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:12,190
- Leave a message!
- Shut up, asshole!

777
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:19,990
Now, if Cabral here gets promoted,

778
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:23,201
that's one more precinct
and that means more money.

779
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,205
- How much more?
- Excuse me.

780
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,043
Commander, help! We're surrounded!

781
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,794
- Call BOPE, Commander!
- What?

782
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,339
- Captain!
- What is it?

783
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:38,675
Cops are cornered at Babilonia.
I think one of them is hit.

784
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,094
There's no one available here.
Everybody's busy.

785
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,846
- What do I do?
- Jesus...

786
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:01,573
I am not in a hurry, son.
I can stay here all night.

787
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,494
- Where's the lookout?
- I don't know!

788
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:09,873
You deal here and you don't know?

789
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,750
I'm not a dealer, boss. I don't know!

790
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,877
We're gonna have to bag you again.

791
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,474
- He's out cold, Captain.
- Throw some water on his face.

792
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,810
Wake up, scumbag!

793
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:34,272
0-1, priority at Babilonia.
The cops are surrounded, sir.

794
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,818
Copy that, Carvalho. We're on our way.

795
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,987
Let's go clean up their mess.
We're going to Babilonia.

796
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:44,491
- What do I do with him?
- Put him on the Pope's tab.

797
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,785
Shoot them! Keep shooting!

798
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,172
We're gonna die, man!

799
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:04,511
- Shoot the motherfuckers!
- You guys are fucked!

800
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,182
They're shooting at us from down there!

801
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:12,853
From down there they can't hit us.
Just stay down, Matias.

802
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,690
Shoot, asshole!

803
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,657
- BOPE is here!
- Nobody goes in! Nobody goes in!

804
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,452
Everybody stay right there!

805
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:40,046
- We're gonna die, Neto!
- Shoot the fuckers! Shoot them!

806
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,383
- I'm out of ammo, dude!
- Then stay down.

807
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:46,219
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em, Careca!

808
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:47,888
Fuck, bro!

809
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,215
Fuck!

810
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,509
They're coming at us!

811
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:38,188
- Lie down! Drop the weapon!
- I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

812
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:41,650
- We're cops, dammit!
- Drop your weapons!

813
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:44,694
- It's only you?
- Just the two of us.

814
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,906
Come here. Sit down.

815
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,200
Check the perimeter!

816
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,995
0-1, it's only the two of them.

817
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,209
Bocao, check out who we got.

818
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:02,420
- That's Marcinho, the drug lord.
- Let's take him.

819
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,673
- You guys OK?
- Yes, sir.

820
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,842
- Are either of you hurt?
- No, sir.

821
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,927
- Are either of you wounded?
- No, sir.

822
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:11,429
Tonight you're gonna learn to carry corpses.

823
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,597
Yes, sir.

824
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:16,268
- What are you waiting for?
- Nothing, sir!

825
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,104
- Grab him.
- Pick him up.

826
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,106
Hold on. Hold on.

827
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,608
Hi, honey.

828
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,569
Your water broke?

829
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,029
Are you sure?

830
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,866
Stay calm. Remember what the doctor said?

831
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:36,121
No need to rush. I'm leaving
right now. I'll be right there.

832
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,457
-0-2...
- Sir?

833
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:44,921
You're in charge. Let's only take this
body down. My son's about to be born!

834
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:48,049
Congratulations, Captain!

835
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,095
Move it! Move it!

836
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:02,939
Jesus, this body is heavy as shit!

837
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,992
If you guys hadn't come,
they would've killed me.

838
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:18,246
- BOPE brought your weapon.
- Help us carry this corpse.

839
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,167
Let us through, man!

840
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:26,004
Get the fuck out of here with that shit!

841
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,674
- Sergeant?
- What is it, Lt.?

842
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,177
Excuse me. How do I get into your unit?

843
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,847
- You gotta be selected for it.
- How?

844
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,516
Check the Police newsletter.

845
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,144
Thank you, sir.

846
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,534
Keep an eye on this, Carvalho.

847
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,119
- Commander...
- At ease.

848
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,372
- Sorry for being late.
- No problem.

849
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,960
Just tell me... Is it a boy or a girl?

850
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,878
A boy... Rafael.

851
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:10,548
- What is that, Renan?
- It's pink eye.

852
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,969
- It's fuckin' ugly, man!
- Put your sunglasses on.

853
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,472
Now listen up. This is a gift...

854
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:20,225
but it's not for you. It's for the boy.

855
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:24,562
It's finally time to pick
your two replacements.

856
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,649
All right!

857
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:32,654
Commander, this is going to be
the best training camp in BOPE's history.

858
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:33,905
You can bet on it.

859
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,908
OK, let's get started. Number one here...

860
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:39,828
- Yes, that's Andre Pedrosa...
- He's on the bookies' payroll.

861
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,413
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

862
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,748
So he's fucked. He'll never make it.

863
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:46,584
Commander. I know this Olavo guy, too.

864
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,004
He's as dirty as they come.

865
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,006
Well, he's going down, too.

866
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,924
How about this Fabio guy?
I've heard of him.

867
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,592
He's a Captain, right?

868
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,761
- Fabio Barbosa.
- He's heavy duty.

869
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,264
He's been pimpin' chicks in Copacabana.

870
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,433
- I'll take care of him.
- Renan?

871
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,685
- Can you see OK over there?
- Yes, sir.

872
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:07,772
The guy looks like Batman.

873
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,275
Renan, what about the two rookies?

874
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:15,280
- The ones you rescued?
- I think they're ok.

875
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,116
- So let's see what they got.
- Listen up!

876
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,120
No busted eardrums this year, alright?

877
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:25,123
And no cut-off fingers.
Got it? Is that clear?

878
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:28,126
The thing with the guy's hand
was an accident.

879
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,963
He grabbed the blade
at the worst possible time.

880
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:36,259
- As for the eardrum... Carvalho...
- That was an accident, Commander.

881
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,970
An accident?

882
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,806
He was a major screw-up.
He deserved it, Commander.

883
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:50,231
A BOPE officer cannot date
a dealer's friend.

884
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:53,276
The truth is Matias was confused.

885
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:57,363
He wanted to be a cop but
he wanted to be a lawyer, too.

886
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:03,495
If Matias were a cop at heart,
he'd have told his girlfriend the truth.

887
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:08,041
But he made up a trip and let her go
looking for an internship for him.

888
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,835
He's been working with us
for almost a year.

889
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,087
He fucked up.

890
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,256
He's been great, a real problem solver.

891
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,592
Alright. But listen...

892
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:22,639
Can the interview be two weeks from now?

893
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,350
Great. Fantastic!

894
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,061
I was sure Matias was gonna give up...

895
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,648
halfway through training camp.

896
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,983
I just got Matias an internship!

897
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,611
You better get yourself a new boyfriend.

898
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:39,864
What happened?
Is everything alright, Baiano?

899
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,159
You tell me.

900
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:47,372
You know anybody in this picture?

901
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,377
Don't you recognise this piece of shit?

902
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,796
- This can't be him, Baiano.
- It can't be him!

903
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,092
He killed a friend of mine.
He killed one of our guys!

904
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,262
- What's it gonna be now?
- Cool down, man.

905
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,973
Look, Baiano, they have
nothing to do with this.

906
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:07,934
- I brought Matias here.
- Maria didn't know he was a cop.

907
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,687
- I just found out now.
- We didn't know!

908
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:14,357
Don't fuck with me!
Don't fuck with me, dammit!

909
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:20,655
Let me tell you something.
Pigs just can't come up here!

910
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,783
- Nobody knew...
- Shut up! I'm not done yet.

911
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:27,078
Who do you think keeps
the peace here? The police?

912
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,955
Give me a goddamn answer!

913
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,583
- The Red Command.
- That's right, bitch.

914
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,044
And I'm their front man!

915
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,880
To stay here, you need my blessing.

916
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:39,090
- We know.
- Who you with, playboy?

917
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,758
- Huh, playboy?
- With you!

918
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,468
- It's us!
- That's right, us!

919
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,262
It's us, Baiano.

920
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,306
I'll be watching, man.

921
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:48,683
- Go ahead...
- Shut up!

922
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:52,770
- Calm down, man!
- Xaveco, put some heat on him!

923
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,856
- What is this?
- Son of a bitch!

924
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:59,736
You've gotta be straight with me.
If not, it's gonna be a problem.

925
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,739
You can keep the newspaper.

926
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:04,866
Let's go.

927
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,627
Neto joined up 'cause he liked war.

928
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,963
Matias because he believed in the law.

929
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:21,007
And the dirty cop?

930
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:24,344
Fabio was just running away
from the Commander, man.

931
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:30,350
What he didn't know was, compared
to me, that Commander was a pussy.

932
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:35,897
JULY 1997 TWO MONTHS
BEFORE THE POPE'S VISIT

933
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:40,193
You have each come by your own means.

934
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:42,278
Nobody...

935
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,824
absolutely nobody invited you!

936
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:52,205
And you are not welcome here.

937
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,625
Prepare your souls...

938
01:10:56,502 --> 01:11:00,463
because your bodies now belong to us.

939
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:06,886
I now declare open... BOPE Training Camp.

940
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,264
You will never survive!

941
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:19,774
Skulls... advance!

942
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:25,822
Assholes! You dirty bastards!

943
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:29,492
I know that to outsiders BOPE
seemed like some sort of a cult.

944
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,036
But that's just how it's supposed to be.

945
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,747
- Ask to leave! Beg me!
- No, sir!

946
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:40,378
We mould our men from pain
and humiliation.

947
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:44,048
To join BOPE, the guy has to prove
that he won't break under pressure.

948
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:48,303
- Go back to where you came from!
- No, sir!

949
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,099
- Go back to your precinct!
- No, sir!

950
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:58,396
You think that no one here knows
that you're paid off by the cartel...

951
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,150
...that you're paid off by bookies?

952
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,069
Do you know why your number is 0-1?

953
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,613
Because you'll be the first to give up.

954
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,074
And I'm gonna make you do it!

955
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:14,495
- Ask me! Ask me to quit!
- No, sir! No, sir!

956
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,498
If you don't you're gonna be fucked!

957
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:20,752
- Beg, motherfucker!
- Okay, I give up! I give up!

958
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,547
-0-1 has given up!
- Skulls!

959
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:30,094
Out of every 100 cops who try,
five make the cut.

960
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,681
When I did it, only three of us made it.

961
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,684
Not even the Israeli army trained
men as tough as we did.

962
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:39,937
BOPE soldiers kill guerrillas

963
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,441
With knives in their teeth
they skin' em whole

964
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,527
We skin' em and then kill' em
with rifles by our side

965
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:50,490
BOPE soldiers defend Brazil's pride!

966
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:56,746
To join the war against the drug business,
you had to be able to take all kinds of shit.

967
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,001
The concept of strategy,

968
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,880
in Greek is "strategia".

969
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:08,174
In Latin...

970
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,553
In French...

971
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:16,974
- Are you taking notes?
- Yes, sir.

972
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,726
This will be on the test.

973
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,145
In English...

974
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:24,982
In German...

975
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,445
In Italian...

976
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,574
In Spanish...

977
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:37,161
Coordinator...

978
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,414
- What is it?
-0-5 fell asleep.

979
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,336
-0-5...
- Yes, sir!

980
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,712
Take this, please.

981
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:56,139
0-5, if you drop that grenade
you're gonna blow everyone up.

982
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:00,101
You're gonna blow up your comrades.
You're gonna blow up my assistants

983
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:02,603
and you're gonna fuckin' blow me up.

984
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,189
- Are you going to sleep?
- No, sir!

985
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:08,025
We all have faith in you, sir.

986
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:12,738
Now I will...

987
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,493
...start where I left off.

988
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,957
The concept of strategy,

989
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:27,378
in Greek is "strategia"...

990
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,756
In Latin...

991
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,052
In French...

992
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,848
- Team Leader!
- Yes, sir!

993
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:41,267
- Are you men ready for lunch?
- Yes, sir.

994
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:45,980
- How much time do you need?
- Ten minutes is good enough, sir!

995
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,900
You've gotta be shittin' me!

996
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:52,528
Team Leader, you're a joke.

997
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,948
You all have ten seconds to eat lunch.

998
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,618
Don't touch the food until I say so.

999
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:08,294
When you're done with your lunch,
I wanna see the ground clean.

1000
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:10,755
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

1001
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,674
- Now, go!
- Hurry up!

1002
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:20,431
- Three seconds have passed.
-0-2 isn't eating!

1003
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:24,477
- Your time is up.
- Time's up!

1004
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,442
What is this food still doing here?

1005
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,402
There wasn't enough time, sir.

1006
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,988
Do you think it's fair,
in a country like Brazil,

1007
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,866
where people are starving, 0-6,

1008
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:43,371
for you to leave food on the ground
because you're disgusted?

1009
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:46,457
- No, sir!
- And why didn't you eat, 0-2?

1010
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,796
- I couldn't reach the food, sir.
- Can you reach the food now, 0-2?

1011
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:53,130
Yes, sir.

1012
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,050
Then kneel down and eat the food now!

1013
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:02,890
I wanna see you eat all of it, 0-2!

1014
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,517
- No bullshit!
- Yes, sir.

1015
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:08,771
If you don't eat all of this food
the whole squad will spend the night...

1016
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:10,648
out in the water, 0-2.

1017
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:14,569
You feeling sick, 0-2?

1018
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:18,364
0-2, if you throw up on your comrades' food

1019
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:24,161
they're gonna have to eat your puke!

1020
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,582
- Sir, I'm going to eat it, sir.
- Everybody eat! Now!

1021
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,667
- Hurry up!
- Eat it!

1022
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:33,004
It's all 0-2's fault!

1023
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,214
I wanna see the ground clean!

1024
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:39,844
Men in black, what do you do?

1025
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,805
Take out the deviI that's wearing blue

1026
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:45,349
Men in black, what do you do?

1027
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,144
Go up the slums and take out their crew!

1028
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:51,647
Stop chanting!

1029
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:53,316
Team Leader,

1030
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,861
this is the worst squad
I've ever seen in my life!

1031
01:16:56,945 --> 01:17:01,907
Keep going, Team Leader.
Stop the chant, not the march!

1032
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,076
I want you out of the water, now!

1033
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:07,371
The first phase of the course was tough.

1034
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:12,501
The idea was to weed out the weak,
and then punish the corrupt.

1035
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:15,796
But me? I liked to punish first.

1036
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:19,383
-14, lend him your ointment.
- I'm out.

1037
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:25,139
-0-2! Wake up, bro.
- No, man, let me sleep!

1038
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:27,600
- Take off those boots.
- I can't.

1039
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,936
If I do I won't be able to get 'em back on.

1040
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:34,106
- Take 'em off, dammit!
- You'll be fucked with wet feet.

1041
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:36,150
Your foot is fucked, bro. Take 'em off.

1042
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:38,110
Attention, 0-2!

1043
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:42,406
- I've got news for you.
- Yes, sir!

1044
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:44,742
You're the new Team Leader.

1045
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:50,331
You have one minute to put this unit
in formation at the arena!

1046
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:53,125
- Yes, sir!
- Move it! Move it!

1047
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:02,968
Get in formation, you pieces of shit!

1048
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:06,722
-23, get moving!
- That's 20 seconds, 0-2!

1049
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,349
- Your time's running out!
- Yes, sir!

1050
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:09,600
- Are they in formation?
- Yes, sir!

1051
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,060
Look behind you!

1052
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:14,438
- Is that a formation?
- Squad in formation! Attention!

1053
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:16,315
The squad's in formation, sir!

1054
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:17,900
- That's a formation?
- Yes, sir!

1055
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:19,652
- You sure?
- Yes, sir!

1056
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,655
What about your unlaced boots,
you animal?!

1057
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,783
You piece of shit!

1058
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:31,747
-0-2, follow me!
- Yes, sir.

1059
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,750
Move it! Move it!

1060
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,211
-0-2!
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,296
- Do you see that raft over there?
- Yes, sir.

1062
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:42,341
You see it? Now that your boot is unlaced,

1063
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:46,345
- why don't you bring over the raft?
- Yes, sir.

1064
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:51,475
- You think you can do that?
- Yes, sir.

1065
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:53,310
0-2...

1066
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:56,981
know why you won't be able
to do what I'm ordering you?

1067
01:18:57,107 --> 01:19:00,192
- Sir?
- It's not just because you're weak.

1068
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:05,948
It's because to wear this skull, 0-2,
you have to have integrity.

1069
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,201
Something you don't.

1070
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:13,289
You belong with whores.
You belong with pimps.

1071
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:16,041
You belong in abortion clinics.

1072
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:20,379
We don't like corrupt cops, 0-2.

1073
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:24,633
Corrupt cops don't make it in BOPE, 0-2.

1074
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,553
- Are you gonna go get the raft?
- Yes, sir.

1075
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,597
- Are you gonna bring it to me?
- Yes, sir.

1076
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:31,557
Well, let's see if you can do it.

1077
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:36,645
Quit, 0-2. You're weak!

1078
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:39,356
Ask to leave. You're not gonna make it.

1079
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:43,235
Ask to quit, you piece of shit!

1080
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:47,198
- I can't take it any more, Captain.
- I didn't hear you, 0-2!

1081
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,491
I didn't catch that.

1082
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:51,744
I can't take it any more, Captain.
I give up.

1083
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,037
Louder!

1084
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:55,873
So that everyone can hear that
you're a pussy. Say it loud!

1085
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:59,502
- I give up!
- There you go, you piece of shit!

1086
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:03,380
Attention, squad! At ease!

1087
01:20:04,257 --> 01:20:06,050
Face instructors!

1088
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,094
- Skulls!
- You'll never be one of us.

1089
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:10,596
Never!

1090
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,767
Attention, 12!

1091
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,603
Yes, sir!

1092
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:19,730
You're the new team leader, 12.

1093
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,942
Sir, I give up, sir!

1094
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:30,241
You men are making us very happy.

1095
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:33,744
Thank you, gentlemen!
Thank you very much!

1096
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,205
Attention, 0-8!

1097
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:42,586
Our farewell ceremony was humiliating,
but it sent out a beautifuI message:

1098
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:47,258
Fuck the weak and fuck the corrupt.

1099
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,935
When the first phase of training
was over, only eight men remained.

1100
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:02,314
It was time to choose my replacement.

1101
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:06,944
Matias surprised me.

1102
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,572
He passed the first phase of training,

1103
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:12,950
but he was dumb enough
to go back to schooI.

1104
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,705
- You know who told me you're a cop?
- Hold it. What happened?

1105
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:21,709
The head of the slum!
You don't know what's going on.

1106
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:25,254
You know how long it took me
to set up the NGO?

1107
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:28,173
How long it took me
to make it happen? Do you?

1108
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,466
Calm down, Maria.

1109
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:33,012
I won't! You had no right
to put my life at risk!

1110
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,680
- Don't shout.
- I was threatened, Andre!

1111
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:36,765
You don't get it. I was threatened!

1112
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,559
- Can I speak?
- No! You've put me at risk...

1113
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:39,894
and my friends' lives at risk!

1114
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:43,147
- I couldn't tell you.
- I don't believe you!

1115
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:48,110
You are a lying son of a bitch!

1116
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:51,030
I couldn't tell you... Wait!

1117
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:54,283
Maria!

1118
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,956
Tell me if I do something wrong, okay?

1119
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:05,210
- He's so quiet...
- Don't make it too loose.

1120
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,922
Choosing a replacement
for a captain like me

1121
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,590
isn't as easy as it may seem.

1122
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:13,677
- Is there anyone good in boot camp?
- There's one guy who's really good.

1123
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:16,805
- Really?
- Yeah, he's a maniac.

1124
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,016
He was just like me when I went through it.

1125
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:22,853
Choosing the best guy
in the group wouldn't do.

1126
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:26,023
I couldn't leave my men

1127
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:29,234
without being sure that
they'd be well taken care of.

1128
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,527
That's great news.

1129
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:33,530
I think I'll be out in a month or so.

1130
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:39,036
Only 3 ranking officers
made it through phase 1...

1131
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:41,830
and Azevedo chose his replacement first.

1132
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,500
Move towards the target!

1133
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:46,585
So, I had to choose
between Neto and Matias.

1134
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:51,840
Fire!

1135
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:55,177
Holster your weapon!

1136
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:56,804
Good job, 0-6.

1137
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:59,932
But, it's easy when
you're shooting with my weapon.

1138
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:01,058
Skulls!

1139
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,686
Let's see the other four...

1140
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:07,106
-23, where's your strap?
- Loose, sir.

1141
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:10,192
At this stage of the game,
you're not wearing the strap?

1142
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,821
If your partner gets shot
what are you gonna do,

1143
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:15,698
- throw your weapon on the ground?
- No, sir!

1144
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:17,032
- You gonna stick it up your ass?
- No, sir!

1145
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,951
Then put the fucking strap on!

1146
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:20,411
- Yes, sir.
- Jesus!

1147
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:23,080
You should fucking know better.

1148
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:28,919
The end of training is tacticaI.

1149
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:33,132
We teach our men to raid the slums...

1150
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:39,430
and surprise the dealers.

1151
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:47,938
They can't know which way
we're coming from. It's an art.

1152
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:55,195
And like any art, practise makes perfect.
We move in one alley at a time.

1153
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:59,116
Nice and slow, 0-6. Move slowly.

1154
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,411
Slowly. What do you do now?

1155
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:08,000
Scan the area, then move on.

1156
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:10,377
Well done, 0-6. Well done.

1157
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,296
Scan and move.

1158
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:15,299
Move forward, now. That's it!

1159
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:20,763
Just stay calm. What do you do next? Wait.

1160
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:23,265
Is your cover here? Yes.

1161
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:27,436
Hell can break loose, but you stay calm.

1162
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:29,980
- Eyes forward. You clear?
- Yes.

1163
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:33,317
Then go. If you can move, do it.

1164
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,986
That's it, 0-6. Alright!

1165
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:38,697
The finaI exam was the reaI thing.

1166
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,825
In a real slum, with real bullets.

1167
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:47,831
And the only right answer
was not to get shot.

1168
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:51,168
- Shit! The cops!
- Get inside! Get inside!

1169
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:58,967
Captain!

1170
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:01,720
- The lookout ran that way.
- Alone?

1171
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:03,388
Yes, it was just him.

1172
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,057
- I'm going in...
- Wait, dammit!

1173
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:09,019
- I'm gone!
- Come back, dammit! Come back!

1174
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,697
I could not tolerate errors.

1175
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,659
Our men in black raid the slums to kill...

1176
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:25,661
and never to be killed.

1177
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:30,040
Whoever replaced me needed to know that.

1178
01:25:39,008 --> 01:25:41,343
- What's happening, Lieutenant?
- Move in!

1179
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,567
Go for the roof, Renan! The roof!

1180
01:26:01,447 --> 01:26:03,699
Come back, God dammit!

1181
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:10,122
Get your ass back here!

1182
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:21,091
You don't deserve this uniform!

1183
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:24,219
You're no Skull. You're a punk!

1184
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:27,264
You hear me? You're a punk!

1185
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:45,407
What are you taking?

1186
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:51,455
It's no big deal.

1187
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,790
- Let me see.
- Everybody takes these.

1188
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:56,627
No problem.

1189
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:03,133
Well, you won't have to take those any more.
You're getting out. Things will get better.

1190
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:05,969
Out of what?

1191
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:09,306
- What am I getting out of?
- You're leaving BOPE.

1192
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:11,099
Aren't you?

1193
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,685
What's the matter?

1194
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:20,484
You're quitting, right? Everything is set.

1195
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:24,446
What happened?

1196
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:26,698
I picked the wrong kid.

1197
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:31,411
- What does that mean?
- I chose the wrong kid. I fucked up.

1198
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:35,165
Azevedo picked a good one
and I picked a crazy one.

1199
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:41,338
- But you've got a son now!
- So? Azevedo has two kids!

1200
01:27:41,464 --> 01:27:43,799
Quiet! The baby is sleeping, dammit!

1201
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:47,678
Only one thing drove me crazier
than making my own mistakes.

1202
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:52,975
Don't write the guy off yet.
Give him another chance!

1203
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:56,478
And that was Rosane telling me what to do.

1204
01:27:56,562 --> 01:28:03,402
When's graduation?

1205
01:28:03,861 --> 01:28:06,613
Come on, baby. It'll be okay...

1206
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:11,326
The worst part was,
sometimes I took her advice.

1207
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:15,038
- This is what I want, bro.
- This? You sure?

1208
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:18,333
Take a look at the book here.

1209
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,752
- There's a cool Indian...
- Indian my ass!

1210
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:23,088
Gimme the knife and skull, bro!

1211
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,693
Hands up, face the wall!

1212
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:49,114
When the men graduated,
they hit the streets.

1213
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,575
Neto was the hungriest for blood.

1214
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:57,164
He dove right into "Operation Holiness".

1215
01:28:57,248 --> 01:29:00,584
He wanted to guarantee the Pope's
good night sleep.

1216
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:14,890
And with him leading my squad,
he killed 30 thugs in the first week.

1217
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,275
Even though we prepare our men for war,

1218
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:28,612
you may think what we do is inhuman.

1219
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:33,450
But as long as the dealers
have guns, we have no choice.

1220
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:35,577
Every BOPE cop learns that.

1221
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:39,164
Now, even Matias was getting it.

1222
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:44,086
And you know what? It was about time
he confronted those potheads.

1223
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:46,963
See you all later!

1224
01:29:48,674 --> 01:29:50,300
Come here, punk. Come here!

1225
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:52,886
- Take it easy, man.
- I want to talk to you... Chill.

1226
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,055
I'm not gonna arrest you... yet.

1227
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,681
You don't scare me.

1228
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,975
Get that smirk off your face.

1229
01:30:01,604 --> 01:30:03,939
- See these glasses?
- Yeah.

1230
01:30:04,023 --> 01:30:06,483
They're for Romerito. Hands off!

1231
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:10,862
You don't deserve to help the kid,
so I'm gonna give these to him.

1232
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:12,197
If you go to the slum, you're fucked.

1233
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:16,159
I don't associate with addicts or scumbags.

1234
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,621
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1235
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:25,168
Tell the kid to meet me tomorrow
at noon at the arcade.

1236
01:30:25,294 --> 01:30:29,214
- No, man. Ask Maria to do it!
- Wait! Are you crazy?

1237
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:33,051
If you don't do this shit for me,
I'll arrest you.

1238
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:36,054
Got it, you piece of shit playboy?

1239
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,849
You think I don't know you deal at school?

1240
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:43,687
Tomorrow at noon.

1241
01:30:58,327 --> 01:31:01,496
I'm gonna get you a new nose,

1242
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,331
'cause you're snorting so much coke, man!

1243
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:04,749
It's us, dude.

1244
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,211
Xaveco...

1245
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:13,633
Here, Goldilocks.

1246
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:15,552
I'm not taking anything today, Baiano.

1247
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:20,182
- Things are whack at school now.
- What? Are you joking? Why?

1248
01:31:20,266 --> 01:31:23,518
That motherfucking cop!
He threatened to arrest me.

1249
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:25,020
What cop?

1250
01:31:25,354 --> 01:31:27,898
- What cop, boss?
- Who?

1251
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:34,112
- Tell me what's going on.
- Just some shit...

1252
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:36,406
What kind of shit?

1253
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,909
What kind of shit, you fuckin' asshole?

1254
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:41,995
- Hey, Neto.
- What's up, Andre?

1255
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:44,706
- I have a message for you.
- What is it?

1256
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:50,212
They called from that lawyer's office.
I confirmed your interview.

1257
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:54,424
Maria must have arranged it.
I don't need her favours any more.

1258
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:58,929
Are you crazy, Andre? Don't be stupid.

1259
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:01,348
You gotta get that job!

1260
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:03,767
So what's up? Don't stutter, punk.

1261
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:06,019
- Spit it out!
- Fine!

1262
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:09,022
- There's a kid at the NGO.
- NGO my ass!

1263
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:11,858
And the cop wants to help him.

1264
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:16,154
I can't. I gotta go give Romerito
his glasses.

1265
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:19,574
The kid was born blind.
Can't he wait another day?

1266
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:22,536
So what's he gonna do? Tell me everything.

1267
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,912
Okay, I'll tell you!

1268
01:32:23,996 --> 01:32:27,332
- He's gonna bring them up here?
- No, not here.

1269
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:30,502
You know I gotta do this, right?

1270
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:32,796
Where are you gonna meet him?

1271
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:35,924
- At the arcade.
- What time?

1272
01:32:36,008 --> 01:32:38,802
- Spit it out, dammit!
- At noon! At noon!

1273
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:49,354
Years later, Matias told me that

1274
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:53,483
he wouldn't have gone to the
interview if Neto hadn't insisted.

1275
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:57,654
Deep inside, he wanted to be a lawyer.

1276
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,823
What are your plans
once you finish school?

1277
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,659
I intend to specialise in Criminal Law.

1278
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,495
I hadn't chosen the wrong replacement.

1279
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:15,130
Man, you got another token?

1280
01:33:15,214 --> 01:33:16,464
You winning or losing?

1281
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:19,217
- Losing.
- You gotta win, dude!

1282
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:21,136
Ze, give him another token.

1283
01:33:32,356 --> 01:33:34,524
- Romerito!
- He's here! Let's go, boss!

1284
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:36,484
Take it easy, bro.

1285
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,820
We gotta kid here. Relax.

1286
01:33:38,904 --> 01:33:40,739
- Are you Romerito?
- Yes, sir!

1287
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:43,700
I got a gift for you!

1288
01:33:45,536 --> 01:33:49,039
Now you'll be able to see better.

1289
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,708
- Where's Andre?
- Working. Try 'em on.

1290
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:55,337
- Wow, cool!
- Now you look like a man.

1291
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:56,880
Quit joking.

1292
01:33:57,882 --> 01:34:00,216
Sir, I think you better go.

1293
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:05,555
Get inside the bar!

1294
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:15,523
Don't shoot! I'm gonna
finish off this son of a bitch!

1295
01:34:18,944 --> 01:34:22,364
What the hell is this? What the fuck?!

1296
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:24,908
Shit!

1297
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:31,665
The son of a bitch is BOPE!
Shit! Let's move!

1298
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:35,126
Baiano knew that if Neto died,
he'd be good as dead, too.

1299
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:40,215
If a BOPE officer gets killed,

1300
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,719
we won't stop till we get the
guy who did it.

1301
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:48,431
Baiano had warned those kids that
he didn't want cops in his slum.

1302
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:51,935
But a BOPE cop?
That he would never forgive.

1303
01:34:55,606 --> 01:34:57,982
But those rich, college kids, man...

1304
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:01,403
They just didn't get it.

1305
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:06,241
What the hell...
You can't barge in like this!

1306
01:35:06,325 --> 01:35:08,118
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck!

1307
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:23,633
Put that gun down, Tinho.

1308
01:35:24,176 --> 01:35:25,802
What's going on?

1309
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:48,742
Can you tell me where I can find Matias?

1310
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,660
He's over there.

1311
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:54,998
He's gonna make it, Carvalho.

1312
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:56,666
- But, Nascimento...
- He can pull through.

1313
01:35:56,792 --> 01:36:00,170
- He took two bullets in his back...
- Yeah, but he's gonna make it.

1314
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,258
What do you want?

1315
01:36:06,135 --> 01:36:09,137
- Is your friend doing okay?
- No.

1316
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:15,018
I went to the police station, they
said there's nothing they can do...

1317
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:19,606
- And Romerito? How is he?
- He's fine. He's at my place.

1318
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:20,982
But...

1319
01:36:21,984 --> 01:36:24,110
they took Roberta and Rodrigues.

1320
01:36:26,697 --> 01:36:30,033
Don't worry, Baiano is socially conscious.

1321
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:33,661
Andre, I'm serious.
Rodrigues was bleeding...

1322
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,706
Didn't you tell me you were an honest cop?

1323
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,708
Now it's okay that I'm a cop?

1324
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:44,297
Anyway, I'm sure
your friends are already dead.

1325
01:36:44,381 --> 01:36:45,548
Don't do this!

1326
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:58,561
- For the love of God!
- I warned you, didn't I?

1327
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:07,487
Burn the fuckin' piece of shit.

1328
01:37:07,571 --> 01:37:08,988
- Burn!
- Burn, motherfucker!

1329
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,493
- No!
- Light him up.

1330
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,761
Is everything okay?

1331
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:34,180
Don't you ever talk about my job again!

1332
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:35,431
What...?

1333
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:37,934
No more talking about my job in this house!

1334
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:41,187
You understand?
I give the orders in this house!

1335
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:44,941
Not one word about
my team inside this house!

1336
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:47,777
Am I clear? You got that?

1337
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:53,074
I give the fucking orders!

1338
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:13,469
Listen... go to your mother's,
and only come back when I tell you to.

1339
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:16,973
But... where are you going?

1340
01:38:17,099 --> 01:38:19,934
Don't worry... I'm gonna stay around here.

1341
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:27,817
Two bodies were found
in the Prazeres slum.

1342
01:38:28,777 --> 01:38:33,156
The bodies are believed to belong
to student Roberta Fontes,

1343
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:37,660
the daughter of businessman Alceu Fontes,
and to sociaI worker Pedro Rodrigues.

1344
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:41,247
Reporter Ana Luiza is interviewing
the Security Secretary,

1345
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,917
who has just made a statement.

1346
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:48,338
Does the body belong to Ms Fontes?

1347
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:51,341
We need to wait for the report to
make sure the body is actually hers.

1348
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:56,846
We are doing everything we can
to help victims' families.

1349
01:39:02,853 --> 01:39:05,647
- What's wrong, Auntie?
- You okay?

1350
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:25,124
Fire!

1351
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:07,375
For Matias, Neto's death was a tragedy.

1352
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:10,336
They'd been friends since childhood.

1353
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:18,261
But, I had to use his pain...

1354
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:21,055
...in order to complete my mission.

1355
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:32,734
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not here to argue.

1356
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:36,946
I'm just asking what you're doing here.

1357
01:40:37,072 --> 01:40:38,781
I think I can help you.

1358
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,617
How can you help me?

1359
01:40:44,204 --> 01:40:47,040
I know someone that can help you.

1360
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:48,124
Who?

1361
01:40:50,627 --> 01:40:53,963
I'll tell if you promise
that she won't be harmed.

1362
01:40:56,967 --> 01:40:58,801
OK, sure. Who is it?

1363
01:41:02,473 --> 01:41:03,806
It's Rose.

1364
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:07,894
Now this bitch is gonna talk.

1365
01:41:10,981 --> 01:41:12,815
Now you're gonna talk!

1366
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:16,486
- Where's your fucking boyfriend?
- I don't know!

1367
01:41:16,612 --> 01:41:19,489
- Where the fuck is he?
- I don't know!

1368
01:41:19,615 --> 01:41:21,282
Where is he?

1369
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:23,076
- I don't know.
- Speak up!

1370
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,744
Where is he, damn it?!

1371
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:27,080
- You think I'm joking?
- Enough!

1372
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:29,248
Ok! Tell me now!

1373
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:31,626
Where? Where?

1374
01:41:47,101 --> 01:41:48,518
Give it up, punk!

1375
01:41:48,602 --> 01:41:51,521
Put your hands up... don't say a word!

1376
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:55,108
Don't you do a damn thing!

1377
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:57,110
- Where's Baiano?
- I don't know...

1378
01:41:57,194 --> 01:42:00,863
- Damn it! Where's Baiano?
- Hurry up! Tell me!

1379
01:42:00,989 --> 01:42:04,283
Matias, you gotta insist
with these punks, got it?

1380
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:06,869
Where the fuck is Baiano?
You son of a bitch!

1381
01:42:06,995 --> 01:42:09,539
Where's Baiano? Speak up!

1382
01:42:14,002 --> 01:42:15,211
- Where's Baiano?
- Where is he?

1383
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:18,381
I didn't know the playboy was one of you...

1384
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:20,633
What playboy?

1385
01:42:20,717 --> 01:42:23,719
Captain, I know who he's talking about.

1386
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:16,772
In Rio, no one protests when a cop dies.

1387
01:43:17,065 --> 01:43:19,609
They only do it for rich people.

1388
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:25,615
When I see those rich kids protesting,
I feeI like kicking their asses, too.

1389
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:29,785
- You son of a bitch!
- Stop it!

1390
01:43:31,246 --> 01:43:33,414
- What are you doing?
- Let me go!

1391
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:38,085
- Stop it!
- Son of a bitch!

1392
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:44,884
- Get out of here!
- Get off of me!

1393
01:43:44,968 --> 01:43:47,303
- Stop it!
- He killed my friend, dammit!

1394
01:43:47,387 --> 01:43:50,056
- He killed my best friend!
- You let go of me!

1395
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:52,141
- Stop it, Matias!
- Let him go!

1396
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:55,561
You gonna hit a cop?
You gonna hit a cop, now?

1397
01:43:57,606 --> 01:44:01,484
You motherfuckers! You're just like him!

1398
01:44:01,985 --> 01:44:03,945
A bunch of rich assholes!

1399
01:44:05,113 --> 01:44:06,656
Get out of here, Andre! Just get lost!

1400
01:44:06,782 --> 01:44:10,117
What? You slut! You're just like him!

1401
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:13,162
A bunch of fucking potheads!

1402
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:16,082
Matias wasn't just out for revenge,

1403
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:18,751
he was turning into a real BOPE officer.

1404
01:44:18,835 --> 01:44:22,588
- Open the fucking door!
- Take it easy! Put down that gun!

1405
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:24,090
Where's the fuckin' pot?

1406
01:44:24,174 --> 01:44:25,925
Where is it, dammit! You son of a bitch!

1407
01:44:26,009 --> 01:44:27,843
Where's the fucking weed, man?

1408
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:31,597
- Where's the fucking pot?
- Alright! Alright!

1409
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:35,101
Go get it, you faggot, son of a bitch!

1410
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:38,312
Hurry up!

1411
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:42,149
Let's go, damn it!

1412
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:47,196
My mission wasn't to secure the
Pope's good night sleep any more.

1413
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:50,199
Neto had already taken care of that.

1414
01:44:50,325 --> 01:44:54,870
I had to get back to my family
and put someone worthy in my place.

1415
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:01,585
But to do that I had to nail Baiano.

1416
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,716
No matter what it took.

1417
01:45:06,883 --> 01:45:09,593
Up against the wall! Lift up your shirt!

1418
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:13,139
I couldn't go in and search
innocent people's homes.

1419
01:45:13,223 --> 01:45:16,892
I know it sounds crazy,
but at that point I would do anything.

1420
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:19,103
Nothing could stop me.

1421
01:45:19,229 --> 01:45:22,064
We gotta check out the perimeter, Andre.

1422
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:24,775
Up there, at that entrance,
there aren't any dealers.

1423
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:27,111
We're gonna have to go door to door.

1424
01:45:27,237 --> 01:45:28,446
Open up!

1425
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,573
Police! Hands on the table!

1426
01:45:31,033 --> 01:45:33,409
Wake up, scumbag! Wake up! Wake up!

1427
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:37,580
- Good morning, son!
- Good morning, sir!

1428
01:45:37,956 --> 01:45:41,542
- May I please search your room?
- Yes, sir.

1429
01:45:41,626 --> 01:45:43,377
- May I take a look around?
- Of course, sir.

1430
01:45:43,462 --> 01:45:46,297
0-4! Can you please search his closet?

1431
01:45:49,926 --> 01:45:52,136
Look what I found, 0-1.

1432
01:45:52,554 --> 01:45:55,556
These shoes cost more than what
we make in a month, sir!

1433
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:58,225
- Where did you get these?
- I won them, sir!

1434
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:00,436
Now you've lost them. Come on, let's go!

1435
01:46:00,562 --> 01:46:04,357
We'll be in deep shit, Captain.
The locals are watching.

1436
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:07,526
- We're causing trouble.
- Renan, Renan. The guy killed Neto.

1437
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:11,572
I came up here to catch him
and I'm gonna finish him off today!

1438
01:46:11,656 --> 01:46:14,658
- You wanna leave?
- We're messing with innocent people.

1439
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:18,621
You wanna go? It's not a problem.
Take your team and these five kids.

1440
01:46:18,747 --> 01:46:21,457
If you feel so bad about it,
take all of 'em.

1441
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:23,459
- Go ahead, Renan.
- Fine. Let's go.

1442
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:26,629
Are you a student? Can you fly, punk?

1443
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:29,340
Come over here. Get down and kneel.

1444
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:34,345
I want you to know that
I don't want to hurt you.

1445
01:46:34,471 --> 01:46:36,180
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

1446
01:46:36,306 --> 01:46:37,848
- Where's Baiano?
- I don't know, sir.

1447
01:46:37,974 --> 01:46:39,975
- Speak up!
- You wanna play tough?

1448
01:46:40,102 --> 01:46:41,977
You wanna be bagged, son?!

1449
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:44,188
Kneel him in front of me.

1450
01:46:45,023 --> 01:46:49,318
- Son, where's Baiano?
- I don't know.

1451
01:46:49,444 --> 01:46:51,362
- Where's Baiano?
- I don't know!

1452
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:54,156
- Where is he? Tell me!
- I don't know.

1453
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:55,991
Bag him!

1454
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:09,213
- Where's Baiano?
- I don't know, sir.

1455
01:47:09,339 --> 01:47:11,424
Where is he, you son of a bitch?

1456
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:13,217
- Give him up!
- You're gonna die anyway!

1457
01:47:13,343 --> 01:47:16,804
- I don't know, sir.
- Captain, he's not talking.

1458
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:20,099
- Take off his pants.
- Yes, sir.

1459
01:47:20,183 --> 01:47:23,144
- Oh, shit!
- Talk, son of a bitch!

1460
01:47:25,313 --> 01:47:30,067
What a pussy! Give me this shit!

1461
01:47:31,361 --> 01:47:34,947
Pull his pants down!
Are you gonna talk now?

1462
01:47:35,031 --> 01:47:38,325
- Alright, I'll talk!
- You gonna tell us?

1463
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:40,327
- Yeah.
- Go on. Take him.

1464
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:54,008
Fuck, Xaveco...

1465
01:47:56,887 --> 01:47:59,180
Something's wrong, man.

1466
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:02,892
Take it easy, boss. Let's just stay put.

1467
01:48:03,101 --> 01:48:07,897
Something's wrong. It's too quiet, man.

1468
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,776
- Everything's OK, boss.
- OK, my ass!

1469
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:16,530
Go get some water, and take a look around.

1470
01:48:44,434 --> 01:48:45,976
All clear, Captain!

1471
01:48:53,568 --> 01:48:55,319
Listen, boss...

1472
01:48:56,571 --> 01:49:00,157
I can give you 30 grand,
just take me to the hospital!

1473
01:49:02,827 --> 01:49:05,079
It's over, you son of a bitch.

1474
01:49:05,163 --> 01:49:08,290
You're a goner, and now you're gonna die!

1475
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:11,544
- Not in the face, though!
- What?

1476
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:14,296
Because of the wake, man.

1477
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:17,383
I already had Baiano.

1478
01:49:17,467 --> 01:49:22,221
0-7, give me the 12-gauge.
Let the kid go. Let him go.

1479
01:49:22,305 --> 01:49:27,518
Now I just needed to see Matias kill him.
Then my mission would be accomplished.

1480
01:49:28,853 --> 01:49:30,479
Then I could go back to my family

1481
01:49:30,605 --> 01:49:33,983
knowing I had been replaced
by someone worthy of the job.

1482
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:36,318
Take him out. He's all yours.

1483
01:49:36,444 --> 01:49:37,486
Wait...
