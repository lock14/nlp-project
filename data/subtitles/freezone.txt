00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,636
<i>My father bought it</i>
<i>For just two coins</i>

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,593
<i>The lamb! The lamb!</i>

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,269
<i>My father bought it</i>
<i>For just two coins</i>

5
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,073
<i>As the Haggadah relates</i>

6
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,714
<i>Along came the cat</i>

7
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,709
<i>And ate up the lamb</i>

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,878
<i>The dog choked the cat</i>

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,479
<i>That ate the lamb</i>

10
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,397
<i>That my father bought</i>

11
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,876
<i>For just two coins</i>

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,833
<i>The lamb! The lamb!</i>

13
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,558
<i>Along came the stick</i>

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,036
<i>To beat the dog</i>

15
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,993
<i>That choked the cat</i>

16
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,590
<i>That ate the lamb</i>
<i>That my father bought</i>

17
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,230
<i>That he bought</i>
<i>For just two coins</i>

18
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,238
<i>The lamb! The lamb!</i>

19
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,273
<i>Then came a fire</i>
<i>And burnt the stick</i>

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,676
<i>That beat the dog</i>

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,279
<i>That choked the cat</i>

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,790
<i>That ate the lamb</i>
<i>That my father bought</i>

23
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,390
<i>For just two coins</i>

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,518
<i>The lamb! The lamb!</i>

25
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,838
<i>Then water came</i>
<i>And quenched the fire</i>

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,552
<i>That burnt the stick</i>

27
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,079
<i>That beat the dog</i>

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,792
<i>That choked the cat</i>

29
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,276
<i>That ate the lamb</i>
<i>That my father bought</i>

30
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,029
<i>For just two coins</i>

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,072
<i>The lamb! The lamb!</i>

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,797
<i>Then came an ox and drank the water</i>
<i>That quenched the fire</i>

33
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,512
<i>That burnt the stick</i>

34
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,073
<i>That beat the dog</i>

35
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,792
<i>That choked the cat</i>

36
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,629
<i>That ate the lamb</i>
<i>That my father bought</i>

37
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,556
<i>For just two coins</i>

38
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,797
<i>The lamb! The lamb!</i>

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,031
<i>Along came a butcher and</i>
<i>killed the ox that drank the water</i>

40
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,752
<i>That quenched the fire</i>

41
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,393
<i>That burnt the stick</i>

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,919
<i>That beat the dog</i>

43
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,553
<i>That choked the cat</i>

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,195
<i>That ate the lamb</i>
<i>That my father bought</i>

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,198
<i>Then came the Angel of Death</i>
<i>And slew the butcher</i>

46
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,471
<i>Who killed the ox</i>
<i>That drank the water</i>

47
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,272
<i>That quenched the fire</i>

48
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,753
<i>That burnt the stick</i>

49
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,313
<i>That beat the dog</i>

50
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,112
<i>That choked the cat</i>

51
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,550
<i>That ate the lamb</i>
<i>That my father bought</i>

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,310
<i>For just two coins</i>

53
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,637
<i>The lamb! The lamb!</i>

54
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,232
<i>Why do you sing, little lamb?</i>

55
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,750
<i>Spring isn't yet here</i>
<i>And Passover neither</i>

56
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,437
<i>Have you changed?</i>

57
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,711
<i>I have changed this year</i>

58
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,430
<i>And every evening,</i>
<i>Like each evening,</i>

59
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,757
<i>I have only asked four questions</i>

60
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,758
<i>But, tonight,</i>
<i>I have thought of another question</i>

61
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,316
<i>How long</i>
<i>will this circle of horror last?</i>

62
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,432
<i>Tonight, I have thought</i>
<i>of another question</i>

63
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,870
<i>How long</i>
<i>will this circle of horror last?</i>

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,037
<i>Of persecutor and persecuted,</i>
<i>Of executioner and victim</i>

65
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,875
<i>When will this madness end?</i>

66
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,799
<i>What has changed this year?</i>

67
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,469
<i>This year, I have changed</i>

68
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,192
<i>I was a meek lamb</i>

69
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,471
<i>I have become a tiger</i>
<i>and a wild wolf</i>

70
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,751
<i>I was a dove, a gazelle</i>

71
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,668
<i>Today, I don't know who I am</i>

72
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,396
<i>My father bought it</i>
<i>For just two coins</i>

73
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,318
<i>The lamb! The lamb!</i>

74
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,955
<i>Our father bought it</i>
<i>For just two coins</i>

75
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,436
<i>And everything is starting again</i>

76
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,476
Can we leave this place?

77
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,639
Please.

78
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,479
Where to?

79
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,272
I don't know.

80
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,639
Not anymore.

81
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,357
I'm ready.

82
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,672
Hello.

83
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,275
You're going to Jordan?
- Yes.

84
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,833
Your passports, please.

85
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,235
This is mine.

86
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,440
All right. Do you have a weapon?
- No.

87
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,475
Let them through.

88
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,908
Thank you.

89
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,478
You're going to Jordan?
- Yes.

90
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,394
Move forward slowly.
Slowly.

91
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,793
Move forward, move forward.

92
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,150
Move forward, madam.

93
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,432
Stop the engine.
Your passports.

94
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,630
Gently, one thing at a time.

95
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,839
Hello.

96
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,078
This is my passport.

97
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,672
And yours?

98
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,873
How did you meet?

99
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,355
Shall I answer?

100
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,028
I'm her driver.
- Sorry! He's talking to her!

101
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,993
You're her driver?

102
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,237
Yes. It's perfectly normal!
- What company?

103
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,159
The name's on the door.
Moshe ben Moshe.

104
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,511
Who's Moshe?
- My husband.

105
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,914
Reason for travel?

106
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,395
I'm going to show her Jordan.

107
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,192
Will you be in Jordan long?

108
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,675
Just 24 hours.
- I understand.

109
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,109
All those bags for 24 hours?

110
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,879
Know how many bags
they have in the back?

111
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,638
Calm down.

112
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,591
Whose suitcases are they?

113
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,595
It's complicated.

114
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,871
They belong to her mother-in-law,
Mrs. Breitberg.

115
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,231
I was due to drive her.

116
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,555
Ever heard of the foolish passenger?

117
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,511
She left her bags in my car!

118
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,312
Let's take the car apart.

119
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,353
What's your training?
- Benchetrit. Shimshon 1989.

120
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,472
I understand. Calm down.

121
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,516
That passenger, Ann Mary Murphy,
was married to a guy.

122
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,870
She didn't know explosives
had been put in her bags.

123
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,069
But I'm Israeli!

124
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,954
I ask these questions for
your security and that of the State.

125
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,954
Let me take the car apart!

126
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,548
The girl looks like a hooker.

127
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,477
Be polite, you.

128
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,034
You don't give me orders.
Stay out of this!

129
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,469
Where are you going after Jordan?

130
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,953
I have an idea.

131
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,399
Do you have family in Jordan?
- Of course not.

132
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,637
I'm just showing her Jordan.

133
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,637
All those cases for a day trip?

134
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,910
I can leave them here.

135
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,034
They're not ours.
I'll pick them up on the way back.

136
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,879
Go to passport control,
I'll check.

137
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,513
I don't mind leaving them.

138
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,792
Go to passport control.
We'll check.

139
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,035
Thank you very much.

140
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,391
A word of advice.
Change your passport photo,

141
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,158
it doesn't look like you anymore.

142
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,272
Show some respect, please!

143
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,879
Calm down.

144
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,353
What a nerve!

145
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,118
We'll meet again!

146
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,869
Hello.

147
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,153
Wonderful.

148
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,435
Hello.

149
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,109
Welcome.

150
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,235
Can I help you?

151
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,316
I'd like...

152
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,988
Bachar!

153
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,758
Come, my son.

154
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,912
Fill it up. High-octane.

155
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,955
Thank you.
- Would you like a coffee?

156
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,315
No, no.

157
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,794
Until 1948, I lived in Jaffa.

158
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,675
And then...

159
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,270
Wash her properly!

160
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,076
Hey, Tsupi. Calm down.

161
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,517
Did you hear that noise?
Take over.

162
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,079
Moshe!

163
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,548
What happened?
Are you all right?

164
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,238
Moshe, talk to me.

165
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,556
It's just a little blood,
don't worry.

166
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,752
A little blood?
You're drenched in it!

167
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,474
Where's the car, Hanna?
- What car?

168
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,397
I've been working on it all night!

169
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,592
Moshe, you're wounded.
Forget the car.

170
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,238
Moshe, I'm going for help.

171
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,793
You're covered in blood.

172
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,595
I have to go to the free zone,
to the American's.

173
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,157
That bastard owes us money.
- He thinks of money now!

174
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,271
I'll get help,
I'll call an ambulance.

175
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,197
Lie down. Don't move.

176
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,117
Hanna, you have to pick up
Mrs. Breitberg.

177
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,596
She can wait!

178
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,153
I'm going...
- Hanna!

179
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,477
Lie down. Don't move!

180
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,192
I'm going to get help.

181
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,673
Don't forget Mrs. Breitberg!

182
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,273
Moshe, I'm going to call
an ambulance. Don't move.

183
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,437
She's arriving with Julio!

184
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,991
He has a head wound.
He's talking rubbish.

185
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,913
I'll be right back.
Stay where you are, okay?

186
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,591
<i>Regional medical centre.</i>

187
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,153
<i>Please hold.</i>

188
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,156
<i>Good evening.</i>
- It's Hanna ben Moshe.

189
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,430
<i>Who?</i>
- Hanna ben Moshe.

190
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,516
<i>Oh, Hanna!</i>
- Yes, it's me.

191
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,995
I need help.
<i>- What's the problem?</i>

192
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,319
In our garage...
In Moshe ben Moshe's garage...

193
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,351
He's seriously wounded.

194
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,391
Send an ambulance. Hurry.

195
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,158
<i>Shell or rocket?</i>

196
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,670
Don't tell the girls.

197
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,274
Don't panic them.

198
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,036
Did you have a good flight,
Mrs. Breitberg?

199
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,078
Liberia?
- No.

200
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,157
El Al is good!

201
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,315
Moshe isn't well.

202
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,273
Moshe, wounded.

203
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,435
Is it serious?
- Yes, it's serious.

204
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,119
But I am here!

205
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,674
Are we going to Jerusalem?

206
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,156
I've booked a table
at the Mishkenot Shaananim Hotel.

207
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,477
But before I want to go
to the Wailing Wall.

208
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,471
Go to Galilee,
the Mount of Olives,

209
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,272
Yad Vashem.

210
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,710
No, not tomorrow.

211
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,114
What do you mean, not tomorrow?

212
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,993
Tomorrow, me, to Jordan.

213
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,314
What do you mean, to Jordan?

214
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,274
Julio, you call this organized?
Doesn't anything work here?

215
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,915
I told you I wanted a driver
and a car for tomorrow

216
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,429
and tomorrow
I can't go anywhere!

217
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,477
Mom, please, speak English.

218
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,754
Julio, guess whom I met at
the airport on my way to Tel Aviv?

219
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,553
No idea. - The daughter
of your father's partner.

220
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,432
She has an office in New York.

221
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,996
I told her about you,
about your brilliant studies.

222
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,634
I said you'd call her.
I have her card.

223
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,598
You can call her
when you want.

224
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,393
She'll give you work.
She's a fantastic girl.

225
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,478
She's beautiful, she's friendly...

226
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,993
and, above all, she's Jewish.

227
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,156
Jewish?

228
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,590
Not Christian?
- Yes, Jewish.

229
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,312
Good, very good!

230
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,633
<i>Hello, good afternoon.</i>

231
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,392
May God's peace and blessing
be upon you.

232
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,959
<i>Who's calling?</i>

233
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,312
I'd like to speak to the American.

234
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,356
Moshe ben Moshe.

235
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,592
Understand?

236
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,595
Understand?
<i>- Yes.</i>

237
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,119
Hello.

238
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:02,756
Hurry up, it's closing soon.
Go on!

239
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,318
The rabbis say it isn't.

240
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,711
Rebecca, keep out of this.
It's just between her and me.

241
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,314
Let's drink a toast.

242
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,349
Sorry...

243
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,552
So I want to see him.
Where's the American?

244
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,751
He isn't here.
He's ill.

245
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,269
Ill?
- Where's Moshe?

246
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,034
All right.
He's ill?

247
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,593
So is Moshe.

248
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,280
Fine.
They're both ill.

249
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,278
Illness aside, where is he?

250
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,077
Honestly...

251
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,752
What is this?
National Geographic or what?

252
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,595
What?
- What do you mean, what?

253
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,234
I'm not here to talk about this.

254
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,674
And before?
- Before?

255
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,559
Auschwitz.
My parents come from Auschwitz.

256
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,113
Mine from Palestine.

257
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,708
No kidding!
I know some Palestinians.

258
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,638
How do you know them?
- We have greenhouses.

259
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,079
Greenhouses?

260
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,558
We grow flowers.

261
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:11,993
We rear camels, cows,
goats and even donkeys.

262
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,680
I have a donkey too,
Moshe, my husband.

263
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,672
Okay, Leila. Listen, beauty.

264
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,995
I'm not here to argue,
I don't know you.

265
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,189
Drink your tea.

266
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,754
Look at me for a second.

267
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,637
You know what I'm talking about.
You owe me 30,000$.

268
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,470
I know.
- So I want to speak to the American.

269
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,438
Can I make a phone call?

270
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,073
Thank you.

271
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,793
Hello, Moshe.

272
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,710
We're here.
We're in the free zone.

273
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,870
I'm with Mrs. Breitberg's
daughter-in-law.

274
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,958
I had no choice.
I couldn't abandon her.

275
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,437
It's okay. We were late.
We got lost.

276
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,712
I won't leave without the money.

277
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,833
This time, it's the jihad.

278
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,999
No. Everything will be fine.
Don't worry.

279
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,758
And I asked
that he wait for us.

280
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,113
He isn't here.

281
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,552
I've noticed!

282
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,873
Thank you.

283
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,638
Go with her, I'll follow you.

284
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,518
These fools set fire
to the farm and the houses.

285
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,876
What can I do?
- Where is he?

286
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,631
I don't know where he's vanished to!

287
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,632
Hurry, save the animals!

288
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,031
Are you happy now?

289
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,230
Are you satisfied?

290
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,715
Hurry!

291
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,798
Well?
Do you like it?

292
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,148
Have you got what you wanted?

293
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,549
What?

294
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,111
Show some respect, will you.
How do I have to tell you?

295
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,312
He started the fire so you could
light your cigarettes!

296
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,034
I stopped working to sort out
the problem with him!

297
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,434
Things are clear
with me!

298
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,596
How can I reach your brain?

299
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,517
What for?

300
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,554
You wonder why?
You don't understand a thing!

301
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,275
The problem here is her!
She shames our village.

302
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,594
Show some respect!

303
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,632
Don't make me even angrier.

304
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,479
I can start a fire too!
I can burn her!

305
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,715
Shut up!

306
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,751
You're going too far.
You're an animal!

307
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,714
Samir, calm down.

308
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,395
Stop!

309
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,030
That's an order!

310
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,070
What's going on?

311
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,758
What's going on?

312
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,871
What are all these flames?

313
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,833
No. I'm not staying here.

314
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,796
After we left Yamit...

315
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,390
To help in the greenhouses.

316
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,150
"Come and see!"

317
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,673
They put me down
outside his house.

318
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,516
"Take him too."

319
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,309
Then they left.

320
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,629
"Tomatoes".

321
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,031
In the nearby camps and villages,

322
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,719
some were saying:

323
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,398
Then I went to a camp

324
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,392
in Jenine.

325
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,031
<i>News flash.</i>
<i>We have just been informed</i>

326
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,957

<i>Roadblocks are in place.</i>

329
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,836
<i>The public must remain alert</i>

01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,918
<i>and report any suspect activity</i>

<i>I repeat.</i>

332
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,830

333

334
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,752

<i>End of the news flash.</i>
<i>We shall keep you informed.</i>

338
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,914
Hello.

339
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,955
What money?
- The money.

340
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,749
Don't ask what money.

341
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,637
I said I don't have the money.
- I know you have it.

342
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,879
What does she want?

343
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,274
You have the money.

344
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,478
I told you, I don't have it.
- I know you have it.

345
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,828
Walid took it.

346
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,077
Don't give me that Walid story.
Give me the money.

347
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,589
He started the fire
and took the money.

348
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,517
I don't believe a word.

349
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,514
Stop!

350
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,512
Stop! This is the border!

351
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,396
I told you, I don't have it!
- You do!

352
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,717
You were there, weren't you?
You saw the house burn?

353
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,515
The house was burning,
you went in and took something.

354
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,757
Walid took the money.
- I don't care.

355
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,189
You're repeating yourself.
I don't have the money.

356
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,629
Let me tell you...
- Go ahead.
