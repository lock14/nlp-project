1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,963
It seems our little secret's out.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,962
- They're opening up everywhere.
- All over the world.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,244
This is it, we're about to make history.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,368
Stop him. Do whatever you have to.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,761
See, I know that you think
you're doing the right thing,

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,491
but you couldn't be more wrong.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,721
New Dawn kills everything.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,684
There are dinosaurs roaming the streets.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,604
- That's what the ARC's for!
- The ARC has failed.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,125
Yes! I'm in.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,083
- It's Connor.
- Get him down from there.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,570
Come on, April.
Don't give me an excuse to fry you.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,080
Philip! You've got to
listen to me, I've seen this!

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,647
You're going to kill everything.
Philip, no!

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,767
<i>Auxiliary power activated.</i>

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,762
Cheer up, Matt, it's working.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,367
- No!
- Connor!

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,406
No!

19
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,243
We have to go after Connor.

20
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,010
Philip, at least let me go after him!

21
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,322
No one is going after Connor
until this anomaly is stable.

22
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,686
But you can't control this!
You have to listen to me!

23
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,729
No, you listen to me.

24
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,162
This machine is already generating
more power

25
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,970
than the entire National Grid
and this is only the beginning.

26
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,680
Did you ever even care about him?

27
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,724
That kid worshipped you!

28
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,847
Of course I cared for him.

29
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,364
And if he is dead, it'll be your fault.

30
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,450
Because he wouldn't even
have been up there

31
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,602
had you not poisoned him against me.

32
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,010
Look around you, Matt.

33
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,889
The world didn't end.

34
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,811
You were wrong.

35
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,800
This machine is a force for good.

36
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,001
My work, Connor's work.

37
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,407
I know he would have been proud
of what he has achieved.

38
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,244
You were wrong.

39
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,120
You.

40
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,243
Get him out of here.

41
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,840
Emily, I have to go after Connor.
I have no choice.

44
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,846
- I'm going to get him.
- No, no, no, I'm going to come with you.

45
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,720
No! I'm going to go and I'm going to
bring him back, I promise.

46
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
You're going to stay here because
I need both of you here, okay?

47
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,765
Abby?

48
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,289
Connor, do you read me?

49
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,522
Anyone, do you read me?

50
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,402
No, not here.

51
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,206
Connor!

52
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,524
Connor!

53
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,562
It's growing too quickly.

54
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,926
No. That can't be right.
Run those tests again, will you?

55
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,285
It's all right, Ray, I expected this.

56
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,006
Connor!

57
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,560
Matt!

58
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,006
Connor.

59
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,727
Connor. Connor.

60
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,486
I can't breathe.

61
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,644
Okay, on three
we're going to move, okay?

62
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,880
- I don't think I can.
- You're going to do it, mate.

63
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,564
You're going to do it.

64
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,291
Move back, we've got to move back.

65
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,890
Get up. Where's Emily?

66
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,325
Distracting the guards.

67
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,763
Matt, it's coming again!

68
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,249
Okay, follow me. Come on.

69
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,283
These winds are toxic.

70
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,526
We'll be safe in here, help me.

71
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,804
Connor, get in.

72
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,844
Abby, go, go!

73
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,886
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

74
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,563
Where are we, though?

75
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,923
Okay. Here, sit him over here.
He needs water.

76
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,561
You just keep breathing and that pain
is going to pass, all right?

77
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,403
Just keep breathing.

78
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,966
Hey.

79
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,249
What is this place?

80
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,890
Our only hope.

81
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,650
My lungs are burning.

82
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,080
Hello?

83
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,004
He needs water.

84
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,166
Okay.

85
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,449
How did you know this place was here?

86
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,362
Water. There must be water.

87
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,204
This is my time.

88
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,241
But I'm guessing later. Or close to it.

89
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,206
You actually lived out there?

90
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,325
Nothing can survive out there, Abby.

91
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,402
Except those ugly freaks.

92
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,765
Oh, no.

93
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,522
It's clean, it's clean! Here.

94
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,689
Okay. Drink this. Okay.

95
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,926
It's okay.

96
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,727
The storms are erratic
and hard to predict.

97
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,644
We're going to have to
time this carefully.

98
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,203
You lived underground?

99
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,007
Yeah, we moved from shelter to shelter,

100
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,048
tried to avoid the storms,
fought the predators.

101
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,489
When I got to your time,
I thought it was the Garden of Eden.

102
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,160
Where is everyone now?

103
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,207
Everyone is dead, Abby.

104
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,409
Have a good look.

105
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,805
This is what New Dawn did to the earth,

106
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,320
turned it into hell.

107
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,523
What is wrong with you people?

108
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,886
Can't you see that I'm actually
quite busy here?

109
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,928
They might be dead now because of you.

110
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,126
Take her away.

111
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,804
You have to stop Burton!

112
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,361
Listen to me! Let me out of here!

113
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,203
<i>- Malfunction. Emergency.</i>

114
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,723
<i>Anomaly expanding.</i>

115
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,009
Check the magnetic field brackets.

116
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,766
What are you doing? Where are you going?
I need you!

117
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,805
<i>Primary reactor offline.</i>

118
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,287
<i>Emergency, emergency,</i>
<i>emergency, emergency,</i>

119
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,487
<i>emergency, emergency,</i>
<i>emergency, emergency,</i>

120
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,289
<i>emergency, emergency,</i>
<i>emergency, emergency...</i>

121
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,410
Helen won.

122
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,205
And I helped her.

123
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,645
All I ever wanted to do was to prove

124
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,931
to Cutter that he was right to trust me,

125
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,720
and I ended up just betraying everything
that he even stood for.

126
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,251
It's okay.

127
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,165
Are you okay? What happened?

128
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,681
Could Philip not afford to pay
the electricity bill?

129
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,160
There was some kind of electrical surge,
everything went dead.

130
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,969
We're on emergency power.

131
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,564
The system is fried,
the detector's offline

132
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,608
and I can't get through
to anyone on comms.

133
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,722
Okay, we'll just get someone to fix it.

134
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,126
Everyone is out in the field.

135
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,566
And I don't think the power-out
is restricted to the ARC.

136
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,403
Philip's infernal machine.

137
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,402
Now I've seen it all, mobile phone
reception when you really need it.

138
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,446
It's Becker.

139
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,801
The electricity is out
all across the city.

140
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,690
It's as if someone set off
a huge electro-magnetic weapon.

141
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,441
<i>- What's Matt say?</i>
- We've lost touch with him.

142
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,363
Get to New Dawn
and find out what's going on.

143
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,606
Try that.

144
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,449
We're on our way.

145
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,245
Good man.

146
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,086
Good man.

147
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,607
Every second we stay here
New Dawn gets stronger,

148
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,090
we need to go and we need to go now.

149
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,083
You two go on ahead.

150
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,730
I'll catch up with you
when I feel a bit better.

151
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,765
Don't even think about giving up on me.

152
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,329
I'll slow you down.

153
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,240
Never.

154
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,930
Whatever we do, we do together,
that's the deal.

155
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,123
I need you to stop that machine,
I can't do it.

156
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,881
Come on, nothing's finished yet.

157
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,885
Connor, forget about Philip
and the machine.

158
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,923
You have to go back.

159
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,484
Why?

160
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,251
Because...

161
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,210
- Really?
- Yeah.

162
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,404
Stop messing around and help us.

163
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,006
Come on.

164
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,809
The wind's died down.

165
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,087
We doing this or what, then?

166
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,446
It's clear, hurry.

167
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,645
Let's go!

168
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,366
Matt!

169
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,010
Matt! Matt!

170
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,648
It's expanded too quickly,
it's not safe inside, come on.

171
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,962
<i>You will find a way.</i>

172
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,008
<i>Our hopes rest on you.</i>

173
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,003
<i>The future is in your hands</i>

174
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,842
<i>and there's no doubt you will do it.</i>

175
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,161
<i>The future is in your hands.</i>

176
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,083
Philip. Philip!

177
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,770
- Connor, you're alive!
- I need you to help us.

178
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,808
I know this is what Helen wanted.

179
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,041
I just don't understand why!

180
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,124
The anomaly has grown so powerful.

181
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,043
Give us the code
so we can shut down the system.

182
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,645
- It's too late, it's too...
- Stop lying to me, Philip!

183
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,290
Otherwise I'll drag you
through that anomaly myself

184
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,009
and I'll show you what you've done!

185
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,120
Listen to me.
I know your intentions were good

186
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,360
and I know you were trying to help...

187
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,283
This is what Helen exploited,

188
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,282
this is what she always exploited.

189
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,165
Humanity.

190
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,970
Your humanity.

191
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,167
She didn't exploit my humanity, Abby.

192
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,929
She exploited my ego.

193
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,006
Give us the codes,
we can still fix this!

194
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,321
It's no use,
the EM surge would have fried the data.

195
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,243
We can't just quit the programme.

196
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,965
Unless...

197
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,606
There is a way. There is a possibility.

198
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,649
Connor, I need you to crash
the computer in the turbine room.

199
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,806
- Do it.
- Then find Emily, I'm going with Philip.

200
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,120
Come on.

201
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,285
Any news?

202
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,646
No.

203
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,243
What if they've failed

204
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,284
and this is the beginning of the end,
just like Matt said?

205
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,286
What if they're all dead?

206
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,011
They're not dead, Jess,
and it's not the end of the world.

207
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,605
If it was, someone would have
sent us a memo.

208
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,884
You know what my father used to say
when things got rough?

209
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,761
"Where's that ruddy whisky?"

210
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,123
Oh, no!

211
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,164
Don't tell me you're teetotal.

212
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,811
There's...

213
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,126
There's...

214
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
Don't...

215
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,722
Don't make a sound.

216
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,610
Okay, how do we do this?

217
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,966
I can shut this machine down,
but when I do,

218
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,564
there won't be much left
of this building.

219
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,200
You need to leave, Matt.

220
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,804
Can't we shut it down
and then make a run for it?

221
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,165
As soon as I take
the last system offline,

222
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,720
it'll be like slamming the brakes
on an aircraft

223
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,121
travelling at 500 miles an hour.

224
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,002
Everything in here will be vaporised?

225
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,125
<i>Anomaly expanding at critical level.</i>

226
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,884
Including you, Philip?

227
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,446
Matt,

228
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,924
I'm the bad guy.

229
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,487
<i>Primary reactor overloaded.</i>

230
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,162
<i>Primary reactor overloaded.</i>

231
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,481
<i>Emergency, emergency,</i>
<i>emergency, emergency...</i>

232
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,568
- We've got to get down and override it.
- But it isn't safe!

233
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,244
I know, I know, just do it, Abby.

234
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,445
Shutting it down now.

235
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,566
Then what?

236
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,602
We need to get out of here!

237
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,721
Where... Where's Philip?

238
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,887
He's not going to make it.

239
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,726
He wants to do the right thing.

240
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,442
No, no, we don't have to...

241
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,523
He's locked himself in,
there's nothing we can do.

242
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,280
Well, we can't just let him...

243
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,601
Connor, Connor,
if this is what he wants.

244
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,247
Come on, we're leaving.
We have to get out of here.

245
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,400
- Come on.
- Come on.

246
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,202
Get clear of the building,
I'll find Emily.

247
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,121
<i>Emergency. Emergency.</i>

248
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,086
Emily!

249
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,200
Emily!

250
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,600
Emily!

251
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,360
Emily!

252
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,086
Matt?

253
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,523
What took you so long?

254
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,686
<i>Self-destruction sequence initiated.</i>

255
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,481
<i>Five seconds to self-destruct.</i>

256
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,848
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

257
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,764
The anomaly is too powerful,
it doesn't need the machine any more.

258
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,729
There's no way we can stop it now.

259
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,651
What are you doing?

260
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,244
Texting Becker.

261
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,165
What is it?

262
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,885
Almost out of power.

263
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,681
We've got one shot, maybe two.

264
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,364
It's not going to be enough.

265
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,609
Okay, we're going to have to
get to the armoury.

266
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,729
Shouldn't we stay here? Becker will
get the message and he'll come.

267
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,770
There's got to be something
we can do about this.

268
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,650
- It's over.
- There's nothing more we can do.

269
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,480
Won't the anomaly close
on its own eventually,

270
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,925
just like they always do?

271
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,366
This one's manmade. It's stable.

272
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,408
It was designed to stay open forever,

273
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,689
to provide it like an endless
energy source, it's unstoppable.

274
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,649
Okay, so plan A was rubbish,
what about plan B?

275
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,051
We're working on it.

276
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,248
Jess said all the anomalies
had disappeared,

277
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,651
how the hell did she miss that?

278
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,529
Maybe it overwhelmed the system.

279
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,124
It's from Jess.

280
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,489
There are future predators at the ARC,
her and Lester are trapped.

281
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,721
Predators? How can there be predators?

282
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,005
Your anomaly, the one in your lab,

283
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,564
it was the prototype
for this one, right?

284
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,766
Yeah.

285
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,404
So, essentially, it's the same anomaly.

286
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,002
It must have re-opened, which is how
the predators got into the ARC.

287
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,889
There's a way to destabilise
the anomaly,

288
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,281
by merging the prototype with this one.

289
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,520
Where is everything?

290
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,326
All the teams are out in the field,

291
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,369
but I thought there'd be
more than this left.

292
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,169
There's no power.

293
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,730
Power packs.

294
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,000
There.

295
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,283
This?

296
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,406
Oh, God!

297
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,010
Hey, hey, hey.

298
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,360
Over here!

299
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,921
Hey, hey, hey.
Jess, you're all right now, we're here.

300
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,683
Abby, keep a lookout.

301
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,407
Okay, let's get a drip in him

302
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,690
and seal him in the medical bay.
That's all we can do for now, right?

303
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,524
Jess. Jess, how many were there?

304
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,680
Um, four or five, maybe more.

305
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,162
Becker, check the car park.

306
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,840
James?

307
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,241
Internal video system is down,
everything is.

308
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,686
Connor.

309
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,600
I need to get to my lab,
I need to get to that anomaly.

310
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,604
Okay, James. Come on. Up you get.

311
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,480
Okay.

312
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,922
That's it. All right, let's go.
One, two, three, take a deep breath.

313
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,444
Just breathe.

314
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,000
Look after Jess.

315
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,560
Hey.

316
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,520
We're all going to die, aren't we?

317
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,130
We're all going to die.

318
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,931
Of course not.

319
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,606
Jess,

320
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,163
have you got a laptop here?

321
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,330
Yeah. Yeah.

322
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,646
Good.

323
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,481
Don't worry, I've got an idea.

324
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,763
It's going to be okay.

325
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,201
Listen, we have beaten
these creatures before,

326
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,921
we'll beat them again. Okay?

327
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,886
Will it hold?

328
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,928
Yeah, yeah, he'll be safe for now.

329
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,003
Okay. You sweep through this way
and we'll meet you at Connor's lab.

330
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,966
Okay.

331
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,810
Your secret weapon is sound?

332
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,327
Not exactly. But disruptive sound
should seriously mess them up.

333
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,005
They work on sonar,

334
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,889
it means they pick up infrasound,

335
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,690
low-pitched noises
way beyond our hearing.

336
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,001
I'm going to overload
their nasty little brains.

337
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,680
Will it be enough to kill them?

338
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,206
No, but it should slow them down
enough for us to shoot them.

339
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,688
Just access this file...

340
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,530
Why did it go?

341
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,403
Wait here.

342
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,960
Out! I'm out!

343
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,042
That's the first one
I've managed to hit.

344
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,611
Thank you.

345
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,326
Becker!

346
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,724
Nice plan, Abby.

347
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,089
All right, it's safe.

348
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,164
Okay, Matt, when I...
When I tell you to close it,

349
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,162
do it in one fluid movement, all right?

350
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,091
Good luck.

351
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,286
Cheers.

352
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,725
Close it.

353
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,610
That's good.

354
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,650
We're locked.

355
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,251
Okay. Ready?

356
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,722
One, two, three.

357
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,444
Easy. Easy.

358
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,641
If we damage the sun cage in any way,
we might lose the anomaly.

359
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,164
Okay, got it.

360
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,326
Yeah?

361
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,523
Look, no offence, but do you
really think this is going to work?

362
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,286
Well,

363
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,009
we've got three options.

364
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,884
One, we merge this
with Philip's anomaly,

365
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,846
it makes the big one unstable,
it closes and the plan's worked.

366
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,889
Two, nothing happens
and it doesn't change a thing, right?

367
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,280
Right.

368
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,521
So far, I prefer option one.

369
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,686
What's option three?

370
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,081
It makes the big one even more powerful

371
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,051
and it accelerates the whole apocalyptic
end-of-the-world type thing.

372
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,849
Basically, not good.

373
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,085
Right, let's find out.

374
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,609
- Ready?
- Yeah.

375
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,886
Okay.

376
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,245
We're good.

377
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,080
I'm going to go and rig the car.

378
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,286
Okay.

379
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,366
Okay.

380
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,000
You're going to drive it yourself?

381
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,843
It's the only chance we have.

382
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,682
You know what I have to do.

383
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,246
It's all about this.

384
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,210
If you fail,

385
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,560
you die.

386
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,764
If you succeed,

387
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,842
if you change the future,

388
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,881
you might never even have existed.

389
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,410
You could just...

390
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,724
- disappear.
- Hey.

391
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,611
It's okay.

392
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,806
- Ready?
- Ready.

393
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,768
You just need to secure
the steering wheel with the seatbelt.

394
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,603
Okay, I've got that.

395
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,124
- What are you doing?
- Matt!

396
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,440
- Stop it!
- No!

397
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,010
- No! No!
- Matt!

398
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,726
Matt.

399
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,330
Matt?

400
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,810
Hey, hey, hey!

401
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,400
- How did you survive?
- I have no idea.

402
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,608
It's so good to see you.

403
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,323
Do you think we did it?

404
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,043
Do you think we changed the future?

405
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,126
Yeah.

406
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,685
I think so.

407
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,685
Matt, what about my truck?

408
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,046
No.

409
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,924
Oh, well, I guess we'll just
walk back to the ARC.

410
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,486
Yeah.

411
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,405
- How's Lester?
- He's going to be okay.

412
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,244
He's already threatening
to sack the medics.

413
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,080
Hey.

414
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,131
- Abby, could I just have a word?
- Yeah.

415
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,566
Um...

416
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,570
I wanted to,

417
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,531
you know, the...

418
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,244
whispered thing?

419
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,800
Whisper?

420
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,125
Well, yeah.

421
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,890
You said that when we were back
and, you know, all this was...

422
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,884
all this was over then,
well, you said you were going to...

423
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,850
You know, you...

424
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,840
You said you...

425
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,201
Great, you don't remember.

426
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,246
Connor...

427
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,771
- Yep?
- Temple...

428
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,611
Will you marry me?

429
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,611
- I'll have to think about it.
- Forget it.

430
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,760
Yes.

431
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,246
So yes.

432
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,609
Oh, please, for goodness sake,
stop fussing.

433
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,762
I'm perfectly capable of
walking by myself.

434
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,604
Here we are.
How are you feeling, Lester?

435
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,047
What an idiotic question,
how do you think I'm feeling?

436
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,040
It's so good to see you.

437
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,085
- I take it this means we've won, then?
- Here we go.

438
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,200
You did it.

439
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,849
I guess this means
we're stuck with you now.

440
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,125
I guess it does.

441
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,124
I think we should keep
the whole "man from the future" thing

442
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,407
just between ourselves, don't you?

443
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,607
The Minister's confused enough as it is.

444
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,488
Well, this is turning into
a surprisingly good day,

445
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,163
with us, you know,
saving the world and...

446
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,608
Well, I suppose that's the end
of the anomalies.

447
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,570
It is possible

448
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,002
Philip's machine might have
closed the anomalies forever.

449
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,364
It'll be really weird
being normal again.

450
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,524
Ah. Only two people
have got that number,

451
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,727
one's the Minister
and the other's my wife.

452
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,407
Either way,
I think I'm in for an earful.

453
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,484
James Lester.

454
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,325
Understood.

455
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,448
So much for being normal, Connor.

456
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,481
A train just left Kings Cross,
disappeared into thin air.

457
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,610
Sorry, does that sound
familiar to anyone?

458
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,608
Anomalies? Chop-chop!

459
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,720
Yep.

460
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,964
Everyone grab a black box,
I'll get the system up and running.

461
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,042
Right. Let's go.

462
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,931
Well, Parker, don't just stand there,

463
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,649
get back to work.

464
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,200
Emily, comms are still down.

465
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,925
I'm going to get my phone.

466
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,320
Hello?

467
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,840
Go back.

468
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,044
You have to go back.

469
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,570
Matt?

470
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,526
What's wrong?

471
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,560
Nothing.

472
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,166
I'm fine.

473
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,003
We're ready to go.
