1
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:26,523
When?

2
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:29,208
Today.

3
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,606
Yeah, when today?

4
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,579
Please. I'll tell him.

5
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:41,484
Hey, kids, how we doing?

6
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:44,840
We're good. Good.

7
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:48,868
And I wasn't trying to surprise you.

8
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,841
We weren't really surprised, sir.

9
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,938
Christian, do you think it's possible
for you to stop calling me "sir"?

10
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:00,952
I really feel old when you do that.

11
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,514
You know, I thought we had
an agreement here.

12
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:09,295
Dad, we're just sitting. People sit.

13
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:12,748
Look, honey, I'm not trying
to give you guys a hard time...

14
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,666
...but we have discussed this,
you know?

15
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:17,255
Technically, you're under my roof still...

16
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:20,228
...and I don't feel comfortable
with the two of you in here...

17
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,585
Stop. Have you seen
the size of this boat?

18
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:25,886
Don't you think we could find
a zillion places...

19
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:28,284
...to do that thing you think we wanna do
if we wanted?

20
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,818
Jennifer, I'm simply saying...

21
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,093
No. I'm over your patronizing tone,
okay? I'm really over it.

22
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,683
Hey, is she like this with you?

23
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:16,810
- I'm sorry.
- No, excuse me.

24
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:19,112
I'm trying to find the galley.

25
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,126
I think it's off-limits to guests.

26
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:23,907
Not so much of a rules person.

27
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:29,278
- It's quite a lobby, isn't it?
- Yeah.

28
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:31,483
This the first time
you've been through here?

29
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:33,593
So I guess you missed the tour,
then, huh?

30
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:39,252
But you had to come through here
when we boarded. Didn't you?

31
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:46,061
Through that door is a service corridor.
Take a left, all the way to the end.

32
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,939
Hi, it's me.

33
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,391
Could you call me? Please?

34
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm actually begging, aren't I?

35
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:11,379
I'd like you to call me at midnight.

36
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:14,256
You know, for old times' sake.

37
00:06:15,886 --> 00:06:17,421
Bye.

38
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:24,134
Baby, baby, baby...

39
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:29,121
Hey. You were supposed to
stay inside. That was the deal.

40
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:32,381
The TV isn't working. I'm cramped.
I'm going crazy in there.

41
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:34,491
Come here, come here, come here.

42
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:36,409
Coming through.

43
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:39,670
It's just, Elena...

44
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:43,698
- ...I could lose my job for this, you know?
- It's not that I'm not grateful, Valentin.

45
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,095
I'm just... I'm so bored.

46
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,507
- You hungry? You must be hungry.
- I'm starving.

47
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:53,384
Now, Elena, listen.

48
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:57,412
Look at me. Promise me
you will not come out again.

49
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:14,962
The ocean has always been
the cradle of rebirth.

50
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:17,551
Since man first emerged
from these salty depths...

51
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:21,771
...we have looked to water as a chance
to begin anew.

52
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:24,552
Poseidon was the god of the sea.

53
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:29,251
He made his home on the ocean floor
in a palace of coral and gems.

54
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:32,320
And so, what better way to celebrate
the birth of a new year...

55
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,814
...than borne on the back
of the old fellow himself?

56
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:37,595
May you all have clear sailing
in the new year...

57
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,609
...and all the years to come.

58
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:46,897
Ladies and gentlemen,
the incomparable Gloria!

59
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,052
- Five thousand.
- Five thousand to call.

60
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:24,875
Goddamn, boy.

61
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,272
You got some mighty big ones on you.

62
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:32,930
- Hey, honey.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:36,766
Get Lucky Larry another drink,
would you? Martini. Okay, babe?

64
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:40,315
- There's blood in the water tonight.
- Five thousand to call, sir.

65
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:44,247
You know, I think there's more money in
that pot than my old man made in a year.

66
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:46,453
Five, and 10.

67
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:48,562
Fifteen to call.

68
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:52,015
Happiest time of my life
is when I was broke.

69
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,221
Make it 20.

70
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:57,769
Let's make it 20, and let's make it 40.

71
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,140
You miss being mayor?

72
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,482
Do you ever win?

73
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:07,935
Forty more to you, sir.

74
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,140
Goddamn, this is getting good.

75
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,826
- Dad. We're going downstairs.
- Hello, sweetie. Have fun.

76
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:14,360
- Hey, Jen.
- What?

77
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,374
Come on.

78
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:18,196
I can see, you know.

79
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:20,690
The twins? Dad.

80
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:24,238
Can you just...?
One more button, please?

81
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:30,184
Pair of fives, huh, Dad?

82
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:34,308
Oh, God.

83
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,240
All in.

84
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,309
I'll fold.

85
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:09,696
- Oh, hey, kid, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

86
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:14,778
- How much for the game?
- I don't know, what's it worth to you?

87
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,272
You were minding your own business
and those chips...

88
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:20,533
- ...jumped out in front of you.
- I wasn't watching where I was going.

89
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:22,067
Come on, sweetheart, let's go.

90
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:25,232
- Sorry about that.
- Not a problem.

91
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,684
Guess what. Your friend the captain
wants you to blow the New Year's horn.

92
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:30,411
No way! Mom?

93
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,616
Go. Conor?

94
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,918
Thanks, sorry, bye!

95
00:10:35,397 --> 00:10:38,658
- Great kid.
- Yeah, he is. Still amazes me, actually.

96
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:42,111
So the captain's table? That's a nice place
to spend New Year's Eve.

97
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:43,837
Does your husband...?

98
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:45,371
- That work much?
- What?

99
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:49,207
The tentative mention of a husband
I'm supposed to correct...

100
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,372
...even though you clocked
my wedding finger twice already?

101
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:55,633
It usually works better than that, yeah.

102
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,839
Normally what you get
on these cruise ships...

103
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,346
...is your desperate single woman hoping to
meet a guy, and you sure don't fit the bill.

104
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:05,511
That's not actually supposed to generate
a thank-you, was it?

105
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:10,306
Maggie James.

106
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:11,840
Dylan.

107
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:16,731
- What do you do, Mr. Dylan?
- First name.

108
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:18,937
Well, somebody's gonna
drink too much...

109
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:21,526
...and get into a fight
with their wife or husband...

110
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:24,116
...and come up here and start buying
chips in a frenzy.

111
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:26,321
Any night, but particularly tonight.

112
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:29,103
And I take their money.
That's what I do.

113
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:30,925
Professionally.

114
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:32,651
That supposed to be sexy?

115
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:35,144
Depends. Was it?

116
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,364
Nice to meet you, first name Dylan.

117
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,985
Come on. That's right.

118
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:21,561
Decided, sir?

119
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:26,548
We will have the RomanÃ©e-Conti,
1988, please.

120
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:28,370
Very well, sir.

121
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:32,014
- Nelson...
- My treat.

122
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,124
That's a five-thousand-dollar
bottle of wine.

123
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:35,851
Carpe diem, my friend.

124
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,632
Carpe diem.

125
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,947
There was no work crisis.

126
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:45,345
What do you mean?

127
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,838
I'm sorry, I lied.

128
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,524
Apparently...

129
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:55,702
...the one who really missed
the boat in London was me.

130
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:58,771
He's met someone.

131
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:02,511
He didn't mean to hurt me.

132
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:05,964
He never thought that this
would happen to him.

133
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:10,567
I'm sure that you know this whole song,
so I don't have to sing it for you.

134
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:15,170
I think I'll get some air.

135
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,089
And then we'll have some wine.

136
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:19,870
Lots and lots of wine.

137
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:24,665
Quiet. Quiet.

138
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:26,871
Gentlemen, keep it down.

139
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,816
Do you feel that?

140
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:37,707
Something's off.

141
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,050
Here we go!

142
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:43,078
Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!

143
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:47,969
Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

144
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:49,887
Happy New Year!

145
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:51,997
Happy New Year!

146
00:13:58,518 --> 00:13:59,477
Happy New Year.

147
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,999
Happy New Year!

148
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,851
<i>You have no messages.</i>

149
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,360
No.

150
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:55,868
No.

151
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:58,169
Hard to starboard!
Starboard engines, full astern!

152
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:01,910
- Starboard engines, full astern!
- I got it, I got it! Come on.

153
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,499
Turn. Turn!

154
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,556
Turn!

155
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,954
Come on. Come on, come on!

156
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:41,421
- Bow thrusters!
- Full to starboard!

157
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:43,052
Sounding general alarm.

158
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,477
<i>All crew, report immediately</i>
<i>to your emergency stations.</i>

159
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:54,848
<i>This is not a drill. All passengers,</i>
<i>brace for immediate and heavy rolls.</i>

160
00:15:59,163 --> 00:16:01,465
Stay there. I'm coming, baby!

161
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,958
Just stay there! Wait for me!

162
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:08,945
<i>Fire, life and safety crews, proceed to</i>
<i>your muster stations immediately.</i>

163
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:10,671
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

164
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:27,559
Help me!

165
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,614
Stay calm!

166
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,738
Conor?

167
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:46,931
Oh, my God.

168
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:49,712
Conor!

169
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:10,043
Chris.

170
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:12,729
Christian.

171
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,715
Christian!

172
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:21,935
Are you okay?

173
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:26,922
Hey.

174
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:28,361
My leg's pinned.

175
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:32,772
Come on.

176
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:37,375
Help. Somebody. Please, please.

177
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,965
Please, help me.
I can't lift this by myself.

178
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:42,938
- Please help me. Please.
- Okay.

179
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,527
On three.

180
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:47,253
One, two, three.

181
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:50,898
Again. One, two, three.

182
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:53,679
Conor!

183
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:55,980
Everyone, remain calm. Remain calm.

184
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,625
Hey, lady. Up there.

185
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:04,036
Hey! We need some help over here.

186
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:06,434
Scootch back from the edge! Be careful!

187
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:08,544
- Grab the side of that.
- Okay.

188
00:21:09,215 --> 00:21:12,188
- Conor!
- Come here. Grab the other side of that.

189
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,339
You're okay!

190
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,544
- His name Conor?
- Yeah.

191
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:19,189
All right, Conor, I want you to jump
into this curtain.

192
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:20,723
What are you doing?

193
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:23,888
I used to be a fireman. We're gonna
get him down safe and sound.

194
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,628
You'll be all right, Conor. Come on, kid.

195
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,505
Jump! Right now!

196
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,108
Sweetie.

197
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:38,849
Everything's okay.

198
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:16,155
Move this thing.

199
00:22:18,552 --> 00:22:20,950
We need something to leverage this.

200
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:22,676
No.

201
00:22:24,498 --> 00:22:26,224
I'll go.

202
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:29,005
It's just dead people, right?

203
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:33,705
- Baby, stay here.
- I'm here.

204
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:35,623
- Stay with me.
- We're gonna be okay.

205
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:39,842
Now, we're not sure exactly what
happened here, but our best guess...

206
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:44,350
...is that we were struck by what is
known as a rogue wave.

207
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,802
They're rare. They're unpredictable.
And they are lethal.

208
00:22:48,186 --> 00:22:49,912
Now the good news.

209
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:52,693
The instant this ship was struck...

210
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:56,242
...emergency GPS locator beacons
were launched...

211
00:22:56,434 --> 00:23:00,174
...so we are, at most,
several hours from rescue.

212
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,092
- Are we sinking?
- How do we get out?

213
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:07,270
Please. Do yourself a favor.

214
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:10,627
Follow the directions of my officers
and stay calm.

215
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,559
This room is a giant air bubble
holding up the ship.

216
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:17,244
Once these bulkhead doors
are sealed...

217
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:20,793
...we'll be safe from gas leaks,
fire and flooding.

218
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:24,341
We will be safe.

219
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:46,878
What are you doing?

220
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:50,139
I'm getting out of here.

221
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:52,536
Where are you going?

222
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:56,372
I'm going up.
And out through the bottom.

223
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,058
Wait. How are you gonna get out
of the bottom of the boat?

224
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:01,647
That's the part that's all sealed up.

225
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:02,894
She was in the nightclub.

226
00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:05,771
We have people there.
I'm confident they're dealing with it.

227
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:09,703
You're confident? You can't reach them,
can you? I mean, what if they're dead?

228
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:12,963
Then your daughter's dead too,
and leaving this room won't help.

229
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:15,457
Half the people here have families
somewhere on board.

230
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:16,895
You know disaster scenarios.

231
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:20,252
These folks start climbing over each other
trying to search the ship...

232
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:23,129
- ...they're gonna get killed.
- How do I get up there, captain?

233
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:25,335
- I'm sorry, but you need to stay here.
- How...?

234
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:28,787
- You may not leave this ballroom.
- Excuse me?

235
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:31,664
I'm within my authority
to compel you to stay.

236
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:33,774
Captain, I understand
you have no choice.

237
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:36,843
There's sick and injured people here.
You need to stay with them.

238
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:38,665
But I am going to find my daughter...

239
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:42,118
...and don't for one second
think you can stop me.

240
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,160
Dylan. What did you say to him?

241
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:51,420
Mom, there's holes at the bottom
of the ship with propellers in them.

242
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:55,160
You can't get out that way, sweetie.
Please tell him you can't.

243
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:57,078
Will you please take me and my mom?

244
00:24:57,558 --> 00:24:58,709
Oh, Jesus.

245
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:01,106
Tell him you can't. Please.

246
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:02,545
But I can.

247
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:05,134
You think you can get us
off this boat safely?

248
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:07,052
What? Us? No.

249
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:10,025
Hey. We're going out
through the bow thrusters.

250
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,039
Captain's saying we should stay here.

251
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:16,642
I wouldn't put a lot of faith in what
the captain has to say. I'm an architect.

252
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:20,287
These ships weren't designed to stay
afloat upside down.

253
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,438
You know this ship?

254
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:23,547
- I know ships.
- Know where the disco is?

255
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:25,370
It's one story down, which is now up.

256
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:28,247
- Suddenly in the mood to go dancing?
- My daughter's in there.

257
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:30,165
Dylan, listen to me. Hey, Dylan, wait.

258
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:32,562
Let's stick together here.
We'll get my daughter...

259
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:36,302
- ...then we help each other find a way out.
- Look, man, I work better on my own.

260
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,125
- No offense.
- None taken.

261
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:40,618
So where's the nearest vertical access?

262
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:42,152
I'll know when I find it.

263
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:46,180
- Hey, hey. You work here, right?
- Yeah.

264
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:48,770
Where's the nearest vertical access?

265
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:50,496
Service stairs, like, in the galley.

266
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:53,757
Whatever you earn in a year, I'll double it
if you take us there now.

267
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,250
Done.

268
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:58,935
You got a plan, and now we got a map.

269
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:02,388
- If you're coming, keep up.
- Let's go.

270
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,608
Hey, Mom, are we going with them?

271
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:08,334
Yeah, baby, let's go.

272
00:26:28,473 --> 00:26:29,816
Ramsey!

273
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:32,789
You know we have to seal
the bulkhead doors.

274
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,337
- Seal the doors.
- Yes, sir.

275
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:48,133
Don't touch anything, sweetie.

276
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:02,518
I know it's been a while, God,
and I've been out of touch...

277
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,546
...but please, please, please
be with me.

278
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:09,136
Be with me. Be with me.

279
00:27:25,151 --> 00:27:28,220
What the hell did you go and do
to all these people?

280
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,111
Cover your face, honey.

281
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,797
- Those are the service stairs, right?
- Yeah, behind this.

282
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,523
Damn it.

283
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:39,537
People, we got a problem.

284
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:44,140
Hey. Hey, map. What's through here?

285
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:47,017
Yeah. That's the...
That's the service elevator.

286
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,990
We're gonna get through this.
Let's go.

287
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,922
Find something we can pry it with.

288
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,569
All right. What's through there?
Is there a way up?

289
00:28:18,761 --> 00:28:22,597
- More stairs.
- More stairs. Okay, let's find something.

290
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:33,338
Careful. Careful. All right.

291
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:35,448
- Okay, get the front up.
- I got it.

292
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:37,653
Ready? One, two, three.

293
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:41,106
- Shit. Pick it up.
- Hold it!

294
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:50,408
- Don't let it rock.
- Easy.

295
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,656
I can't get leverage.

296
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:02,204
Hey, what if we go through up there?

297
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,027
The entertainment section's up there.

298
00:29:04,506 --> 00:29:07,383
- Come give me a hand.
- We'll hold it steady. You'll be all right.

299
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,822
It's okay. Come on.

300
00:29:08,918 --> 00:29:10,836
- Go.
- Come on.

301
00:29:12,754 --> 00:29:16,398
Okay. Now put your back up
against this wall. Come on.

302
00:29:22,248 --> 00:29:24,837
- Good.
- Hurry, hurry!

303
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,851
- Now give me a stirrup.
- Okay, okay.

304
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:33,277
Go up.

305
00:29:42,675 --> 00:29:44,305
It's okay! Honey.

306
00:29:46,128 --> 00:29:48,429
Okay. Send the kid. Come on.

307
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,019
Don't look down.

308
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:55,334
- Come on. All right.
- That's it. Don't look down, honey.

309
00:29:58,307 --> 00:30:00,225
- It's okay.
- It's okay, son.

310
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:03,006
- That's it, that's it. Look, look.
- That's good.

311
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:04,637
That's it!

312
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:06,363
Excellent. Put your hands up.

313
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,185
Reach your hands up to me.

314
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,911
Up!

315
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:12,597
Gotcha.

316
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,953
- Good boy!
- Okay. Come on, Maggie.

317
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,118
Come on. Keep coming.

318
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:21,132
Good.

319
00:30:21,707 --> 00:30:24,872
Okay, up. One, two, three.

320
00:30:27,174 --> 00:30:29,955
Okay. I got this.

321
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:42,998
Damn it.

322
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:45,779
Hold on, hold on!

323
00:30:48,944 --> 00:30:51,245
- Thank you, gorgeous.
- My name's Valentin.

324
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:55,081
Valentin. I love that name.

325
00:30:58,246 --> 00:30:59,397
You... You go first.

326
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:01,603
- Come on.
- You go first!

327
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:07,644
- Come on, give me your hand.
- Give me your foot. Give me your foot.

328
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:10,809
I gotcha.

329
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:15,796
Hang on!

330
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,195
He's gonna take them both down.

331
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:27,880
- Stay back, sweetie.
- I'm gonna anchor us. Hold onto him!

332
00:31:28,072 --> 00:31:29,318
Help me up!

333
00:31:30,277 --> 00:31:33,059
- It's okay.
- Come on!

334
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,525
Help me up!

335
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:40,539
Give me one of my hands.

336
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,142
I'm losing him.

337
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,924
Shake him off.

338
00:31:55,116 --> 00:31:56,363
Shake him off!

339
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:59,048
- Now, or you both die!
- No!

340
00:31:59,144 --> 00:32:00,870
I'm so sorry.

341
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:04,323
Shake him off! Now!

342
00:32:05,378 --> 00:32:08,542
No! No! No!

343
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,585
Come on!

344
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:29,641
- Captain.
- That felt like the galley.

345
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:31,463
Gas shutoffs must have malfunctioned.

346
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:33,573
The door seals,
will they keep the fire out?

347
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:36,929
- Yes, captain.
- Help! Somebody, over here.

348
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:39,998
God rest their souls.

349
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:02,919
I'll take a look.

350
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:29,484
Come on, I think I found a way.

351
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,348
Come on.

352
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:47,801
Maybe you could move your leg.

353
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,393
- I... Nothing.
- Try pulling it up.

354
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,939
Two girls squawking at you,
and nowhere to run. You are in hell, boy.

355
00:33:54,418 --> 00:33:56,720
Any of you skirts ever changed
a goddamn tire?

356
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:58,063
Enlighten us, cowboy.

357
00:33:59,213 --> 00:34:00,652
Feisty.

358
00:34:00,844 --> 00:34:05,159
Never really works to pull when all you
really needed was some good pushing.

359
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:09,187
- Know what I mean?
- Hurry up and lift the thing!

360
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:10,913
All right, grab hold.

361
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:14,845
Three, two, one. Push!

362
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:17,818
Come on!

363
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:21,942
All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
We got ourselves a situation.

364
00:34:22,134 --> 00:34:24,052
- We can do this.
- Come on!

365
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:28,751
Three, two, one, push!

366
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:37,478
Happy New Year.

367
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:40,164
Happy goddamn New Year.

368
00:34:49,562 --> 00:34:51,001
What?

369
00:34:53,494 --> 00:34:54,645
Daddy?

370
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:01,550
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

371
00:35:14,593 --> 00:35:17,086
All right, all right.
There you go.

372
00:35:17,278 --> 00:35:19,484
Give me your water and your hankie,
sweetie.

373
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:24,470
I think it's just a cut, but I wanna
clean it anyway, okay?

374
00:35:24,662 --> 00:35:26,772
I'm gonna look for a way out of here.

375
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:31,184
- Chris.
- Yeah?

376
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,924
Thank you very much.

377
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:40,198
Sir, I didn't... I mean, she saved me.

378
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:45,473
Are you okay?

379
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,885
Just a bad headache.

380
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:52,666
Here, finish this.

381
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,502
One thing we have a lot of around here
is water.

382
00:35:57,461 --> 00:36:00,242
My name is Nelson.

383
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:05,133
Elena. How bad is it?

384
00:36:05,325 --> 00:36:07,051
It's very bad.

385
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:10,216
Were you with someone?

386
00:36:10,408 --> 00:36:12,134
Yeah.

387
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:15,203
Not really.

388
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,135
My brother's in the hospital.

389
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:23,738
I didn't have any money
to get to New York...

390
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:27,766
...so I meet this guy at a club,
he works on a ship.

391
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:32,177
He says I can bunk with him,
you know, for passage.

392
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:35,150
He was pretty nice.

393
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:45,604
What are you doing?

394
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,426
Thinking.

395
00:36:48,193 --> 00:36:51,262
- You?
- Thinking.

396
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,043
What are we thinking about, exactly?

397
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:57,016
Well, I figure this door is the way up.

398
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:59,893
I'm thinking, "What's behind it?"

399
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,729
Hey. Easy there, fireball.

400
00:37:04,784 --> 00:37:06,319
Watch.

401
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:12,936
Conor! Hey, Conor, what are you doing?

402
00:37:13,128 --> 00:37:15,142
Hey, Mom, this door is the way up.

403
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:17,923
Don't walk off from me like that, okay?

404
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,896
- Hey, it's the other guy.
- Hey.

405
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:24,636
Yeah, Robert, that door is extremely
hot, but it's our only choice.

406
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:27,609
- Here. What do you think?
- Let's give it a shot.

407
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:31,637
I'm hoping it was a flash fire, but this
whole area could be superheated still, right?

408
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:34,610
- You tour on a sub?
- I wouldn't call it touring.

409
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,432
Go.

410
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:43,049
- Flash fire.
- Good call.

411
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:44,679
It's all right.

412
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:47,365
- So how long were you in the Navy?
- Too long.

413
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:50,146
I feel like I know your dad.

414
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:55,229
He was mayor of New York for a while.
When I was a kid.

415
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,051
Cool.

416
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:00,311
It wasn't.

417
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,218
Another way up, anybody?

418
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,287
I've been sneaking around
this ship for days. This is it.

419
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:26,685
- All right, then we climb.
- Is it gonna hold?

420
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:28,411
It's possible. It is steel.

421
00:38:28,603 --> 00:38:30,521
Look at the monkey boy.

422
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:33,494
Chris, what are you doing? Come back.

423
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:39,727
I think it'll hold.

424
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,701
Go easy.

425
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:56,990
Elena.

426
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:58,908
You're halfway there, come on.

427
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:02,840
Chris, wait. Come back and get Conor.

428
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:05,813
Conor, put your foot right where my foot is
and go to Robert.

429
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:08,114
There you go. Put your hand right there.

430
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,224
Okay, hang on. I'll grab him.

431
00:39:12,526 --> 00:39:14,156
Great.

432
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:18,472
You might wanna take it easy on that.

433
00:39:20,582 --> 00:39:22,020
- You got him, Chris?
- I got him.

434
00:39:22,212 --> 00:39:24,897
Excellent, excellent, excellent, yes.

435
00:39:27,678 --> 00:39:31,419
- You got her?
- Okay. Here you go.

436
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,323
- Okay, baby, it's your turn.
- Hell, no. Lucky Larry's ready to go.

437
00:39:38,611 --> 00:39:39,954
What?

438
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:42,831
Oh, yeah. Right, sorry.

439
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:45,900
You know, I forgot. Big hero.

440
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,640
Rescued all those women and children
from the fires.

441
00:39:49,736 --> 00:39:53,668
Got elected. Man of the people.

442
00:39:53,764 --> 00:39:56,257
But you're not the boss anymore.

443
00:39:56,449 --> 00:39:58,175
You quit, couldn't hack it.

444
00:39:58,847 --> 00:40:02,011
If I recall correctly, you couldn't even
hang onto your wife.

445
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:06,231
Come on. Come on.

446
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:09,204
Dad. Dad, let it go, okay? Please.

447
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:12,081
"Daddy, please." Come on.

448
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:19,466
Hey, man. Hey, you got it.
Knock yourself out.

449
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:21,384
- It's okay.
- Go ahead.

450
00:40:21,575 --> 00:40:23,398
Assholes, both of you.

451
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,603
You're right. It's okay.

452
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,549
I'm not gonna let you bring me down
with you, not by a short hair.

453
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:35,289
You don't just get the nickname
Lucky Larry.

454
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:37,687
You gotta be lucky.

455
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,469
No!

456
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:49,003
Damn it.

457
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:52,552
Hey, who's shooting at us?

458
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,088
Jen! Jen!

459
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:13,746
Get back, get back!

460
00:41:21,418 --> 00:41:25,254
So we gotta go back down one level
and we find another way up.

461
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:28,323
Go back down? We just came
through there. There is no other way.

462
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,570
You go that way, you die.

463
00:41:29,762 --> 00:41:31,584
We didn't look through every corridor.

464
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:33,694
You do what you want.
I'm getting across.

465
00:41:33,886 --> 00:41:35,612
If you got a better idea,
I'm all ears...

466
00:41:35,804 --> 00:41:38,585
No, Robert, I don't got another way,
but I'm getting across!

467
00:41:38,681 --> 00:41:41,174
You get stuck here, you'll die!
We're going. Let's go.

468
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,764
- Daddy, I can't. I'm sorry.
- What?

469
00:41:43,955 --> 00:41:47,120
- Dylan, can you get me across?
- Jen, baby girl, listen...

470
00:41:47,312 --> 00:41:50,668
No! I haven't been in
a long time, Dad.

471
00:41:59,012 --> 00:42:01,314
Chris asked me to marry him.

472
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:07,164
I love him. I need to find a way
to go with him.

473
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:10,520
- No, you need to listen to me for a second.
- I'm not going back, Dad.

474
00:42:10,712 --> 00:42:14,452
I hate to break up the family therapy,
but you still looking for a way across?

475
00:42:14,548 --> 00:42:15,891
Yes.

476
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:48,977
Do you see him? Where is he?

477
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:52,813
Hey, did you miss me?

478
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:56,074
Son of a bitch.

479
00:43:01,924 --> 00:43:04,513
- What do you need?
- All right. Take the slack.

480
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:11,898
Got it?

481
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,693
Hey, Ramsey! Ramsey!

482
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:19,090
Come on.

483
00:43:19,186 --> 00:43:21,104
I did the hard part.

484
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:29,352
You couldn't even find your way home
from school. We lived two blocks away.

485
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:33,188
- I remember, Dad.
- Hey, Ramsey, come on!

486
00:43:38,654 --> 00:43:39,997
Daddy?

487
00:43:42,395 --> 00:43:45,176
Come on, Jen, you'll be fine. Come on!

488
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:46,998
Jenny!

489
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:51,793
Now, what kind of kid
can't find her way home?

490
00:43:51,985 --> 00:43:53,423
I was 7, by the way.

491
00:43:53,615 --> 00:43:56,492
So, what do you think?
You too big for a piggyback ride?

492
00:43:56,588 --> 00:43:59,945
- Not today.
- All right.

493
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,397
All right, baby. Hold on.

494
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:05,986
Here we go. Hang on, baby!

495
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:10,686
I gotcha.

496
00:44:10,877 --> 00:44:12,412
They're okay.

497
00:44:16,152 --> 00:44:18,550
- You wanna hit me?
- Actually...

498
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:22,098
...you're doing pretty good. So far.

499
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,632
Can we keep going here?

500
00:44:23,824 --> 00:44:26,222
Yeah, let's go.
This way's the best way up.

501
00:45:17,434 --> 00:45:18,872
Hurry.

502
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,013
You're okay.

503
00:46:02,508 --> 00:46:04,138
Let's go.

504
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:22,359
Come on!

505
00:46:22,551 --> 00:46:25,428
Come on, let's go.
Look for a way up, everybody.

506
00:46:28,689 --> 00:46:31,182
- I got an access hatch here!
- Over here!

507
00:46:36,936 --> 00:46:39,909
Dylan, we got water coming in
over here!

508
00:46:49,787 --> 00:46:51,514
Back up!

509
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:56,692
- Get back!
- Wait a minute. I got something here!

510
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,049
All right, get that corner.

511
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:05,707
We can't all fit in there.
We don't even know where it goes.

512
00:47:05,899 --> 00:47:08,968
If we stay here, we drown. Let's go!
We gotta keep moving up.

513
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,406
Oh, my God!

514
00:47:11,653 --> 00:47:14,818
All right. I got a vertical shaft
up ahead about 10 yards.

515
00:47:14,914 --> 00:47:16,928
Looks like it leads to the upper levels.

516
00:47:17,024 --> 00:47:18,942
- Chris?
- Might as well give him a chance...

517
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:21,243
- ...to kick me in the head.
- Come on, Chris!

518
00:47:37,738 --> 00:47:40,424
We're good. The shaft leads up.

519
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:44,356
- Are you okay, sweetheart?
- I think so.

520
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:45,890
Just keep on moving.

521
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:06,989
God. How the hell
did you fit through here?

522
00:48:10,825 --> 00:48:13,989
Mom, don't look down, okay?

523
00:48:15,332 --> 00:48:17,154
- Okay, Nelson, you're next.
- Okay.

524
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,935
- I'll be the last one. You go.
- Elena, just get in the vent.

525
00:48:20,127 --> 00:48:22,141
- I'll wait here a little longer.
- You're fine.

526
00:48:22,237 --> 00:48:25,210
- I can't go in there. I'm sorry, I can't!
- Elena, get in the vent.

527
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,320
The water's rising.
Elena, get in the vent!

528
00:48:27,512 --> 00:48:31,348
- Elena, if you don't go, we don't go.
- What? What?

529
00:48:31,444 --> 00:48:32,690
No! No!

530
00:48:32,882 --> 00:48:35,376
Go on, go! Grab her, grab her!
You got her?

531
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:39,404
It seems congratulations are in order,
Chris.

532
00:48:39,595 --> 00:48:40,938
Thank you, sir.

533
00:48:41,322 --> 00:48:43,144
I'm glad she finally told you.

534
00:48:43,336 --> 00:48:46,787
Well, tradition might have had you
coming to me first.

535
00:48:46,788 --> 00:48:48,227
Yeah, I realize that.

536
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:52,159
And I wanted to, I really did, but she
made me promise not to say anything.

537
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:54,364
She's really careful
when it comes to you, sir.

538
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:58,104
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Come on, Elena.

539
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,790
- You're doing great. Come on.
- Elena, take my foot!

540
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:04,338
Grab my ankle.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

541
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:10,188
- You can do it. That's it, just hold on.
- I can't breathe.

542
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:17,093
No.

543
00:49:26,108 --> 00:49:27,738
Elena?

544
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,656
We're gonna go up now.

545
00:49:53,152 --> 00:49:54,879
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

546
00:49:56,988 --> 00:49:58,139
I'm stuck!

547
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:02,071
Oh, my God. He's stuck.
Please, get me out! Get me out!

548
00:50:02,263 --> 00:50:06,483
- Get me out, out, out!
- Hey, calm down, calm down.

549
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:09,839
Get me out of here.

550
00:50:10,031 --> 00:50:13,292
Elena, you need to reach up
and help him.

551
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:16,648
I need you to reach up and help him.
Reach up.

552
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:25,471
- Conor. Conor, can you crawl up here?
- Yeah.

553
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:28,540
Get me out! Get me out!

554
00:50:28,924 --> 00:50:30,842
Get me out of here!

555
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:37,843
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

556
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,007
Now, you feel that screw
on the other side?

557
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,117
- Yeah.
- Turn it to the left.

558
00:50:43,885 --> 00:50:45,227
You got it?

559
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:47,241
Elena. Elena.

560
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:51,461
Hey, hey. Nelson tells me you're on
your way to see your little brother.

561
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:54,722
Is he older or younger?

562
00:50:54,913 --> 00:50:56,640
- He's younger.
- Younger?

563
00:50:56,735 --> 00:50:58,749
Yeah, he was always so small.

564
00:50:58,845 --> 00:51:02,777
Elena, you don't want your little brother
to think you didn't come.

565
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:04,216
You understand?

566
00:51:04,408 --> 00:51:07,381
- No. I'm too scared!
- Just reach up and grab Nelson's foot.

567
00:51:07,476 --> 00:51:08,627
- Come on.
- Please.

568
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,066
Promise me I get to see him!

569
00:51:10,258 --> 00:51:12,018
- Reach up and grab his foot!
- Push my foot.

570
00:51:12,176 --> 00:51:13,614
Promise me I get to see him!

571
00:51:13,806 --> 00:51:16,875
Okay, I promise.
I promise you'll see him, just reach up.

572
00:51:18,122 --> 00:51:19,944
There you go. There you go!

573
00:51:20,136 --> 00:51:21,382
Now push!

574
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:24,259
Just breathe. Come on, you got it!

575
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:27,616
Push, Elena.
Push him up! That's it, Elena!

576
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:30,589
Push! You got it, there, yeah!

577
00:51:31,932 --> 00:51:34,137
You got it, there you go!

578
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:35,864
I did it, I did it, I did it.

579
00:51:36,055 --> 00:51:39,220
- Oh, thank you.
- Now climb!

580
00:51:39,987 --> 00:51:42,001
- Hurry, hurry!
- Come on, do it again.

581
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:44,399
It's... It's too tight.

582
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:46,700
Oh, my God.

583
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,906
How are we going up there?

584
00:51:49,098 --> 00:51:50,345
We're working on it.

585
00:51:52,455 --> 00:51:55,428
We need something up here
we could use as a screwdriver.

586
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:56,962
A coin, a ring, anything.

587
00:51:57,058 --> 00:51:58,592
I can't even get into my pockets.

588
00:51:58,976 --> 00:52:00,510
Wait, wait!

589
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:05,881
<i>Oy vey</i>, that would be ironic.

590
00:52:09,717 --> 00:52:13,074
Conor, you're gonna do this.
Don't worry. Here we go.

591
00:52:13,265 --> 00:52:15,375
Hurry! Hurry!

592
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:18,540
Hurry up!

593
00:52:18,732 --> 00:52:20,650
- Okay, turn it to the left.
- Okay.

594
00:52:20,746 --> 00:52:22,184
Come on.

595
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,870
Can you reach it? Don't drop it.

596
00:52:26,116 --> 00:52:27,267
Come on!

597
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:29,473
- Is that working?
- Yeah.

598
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:33,309
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

599
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:35,515
Come on, we got it.

600
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,463
Don't worry, sweetie,
Dylan's right behind me.

601
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,683
This thing's sealed from the other side!

602
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:08,505
It's the only way out.

603
00:53:09,848 --> 00:53:12,629
- Except for this, maybe.
- Another vent? No, not again.

604
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:14,930
No, wait a minute. What's this up here?

605
00:53:16,465 --> 00:53:18,287
Dylan, give me your hand.

606
00:53:19,438 --> 00:53:20,972
I need somebody's help!

607
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:32,193
- We'll be okay.
- Got it.

608
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:34,207
There you go. Any idea where we are?

609
00:53:34,399 --> 00:53:36,796
We got two more levels after this,
come on.

610
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:41,304
Got him?

611
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:52,428
Oh, my God. What is this place?

612
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,168
This is a ballast tank. They fill these up
to keep the ship stable.

613
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,909
That valve right there leads to the tank
next door. That may be our way through.

614
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,539
May be? What other way is there?

615
00:54:01,635 --> 00:54:04,608
It's a pressure valve. It won't open
unless there's tremendous pressure.

616
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,773
- Oh, don't tell us we're trapped.
- No, no, it'll open.

617
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:09,115
How?

618
00:54:09,307 --> 00:54:12,472
By flooding this entire tank.

619
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:14,582
- What?
- Exactly.

620
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:18,034
- No. You don't even know if it's gonna open!
- That's insane. It's nuts.

621
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,007
- Wait a minute. We drown ourselves?
- No. No one's drowning.

622
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:22,350
That valve will open...

623
00:54:22,446 --> 00:54:26,090
...and the water'll carry us from one tank
to the next till we find an open hatch.

624
00:54:26,282 --> 00:54:29,063
- How do we know there's an open hatch?
- Or if we can find it...

625
00:54:29,255 --> 00:54:31,556
- ...before we run out of air?
- It's our only option!

626
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:34,146
What about the a.c. vent down there?
We never tried that.

627
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,447
- Let's try the new vent.
- I can't go. I'm sorry.

628
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,845
- Just go without me.
- Mom, the water's coming!

629
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:40,188
Get away.

630
00:54:40,283 --> 00:54:42,777
- Dylan, listen to me.
- We need to make a decision.

631
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:51,408
You better be right. Flood it.

632
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,710
- Oh, my God.
- Everybody, back up. Get back!

633
00:54:53,902 --> 00:54:55,820
- What? No.
- Dylan, you can't.

634
00:54:56,011 --> 00:54:59,368
- Now, get back there.
- Jen, come here. Come here, honey.

635
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,533
- Get back! Back up! Ready?
- Just open the valve!

636
00:55:06,465 --> 00:55:09,342
- Now! Over here!
- All right, stay calm.

637
00:55:16,151 --> 00:55:18,165
- Come on, just grab on!
- I can't...

638
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:22,768
Nelson!

639
00:55:23,631 --> 00:55:24,878
Nelson.

640
00:55:28,522 --> 00:55:30,248
Hang onto the side!

641
00:55:31,016 --> 00:55:32,838
- Chris!
- Baby, hold on tight!

642
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,180
- That's it.
- Oh, my God!

643
00:55:36,578 --> 00:55:38,592
- Start swimming!
- Hold on, baby!

644
00:55:38,688 --> 00:55:39,935
Hold on!

645
00:55:51,635 --> 00:55:52,977
Get away from it!

646
00:57:11,233 --> 00:57:12,768
You okay?

647
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,302
Come on!

648
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:22,838
Dad!

649
00:57:24,084 --> 00:57:26,002
- You all right?
- Yeah.

650
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:30,318
Where's Dylan? Dylan!

651
00:57:30,606 --> 00:57:33,387
Where's Dylan? Can you see him?

652
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:37,894
There's a... There's an open hatch.
Right here. Take a deep breath.

653
00:57:38,086 --> 00:57:39,620
- We're gonna go through.
- How far?

654
00:57:39,812 --> 00:57:42,210
- Take a deep breath!
- Right here.

655
00:57:43,552 --> 00:57:45,854
- Is there a way out?
- I'm sure there is.

656
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,252
- Maggie!
- Okay.

657
00:57:48,443 --> 00:57:50,936
- Maggie, give him to me.
- No, I've got him.

658
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:54,581
Let me take him. I was a swimmer
in high school. I tell you, I got him.

659
00:59:51,006 --> 00:59:52,541
Where's Nelson and Elena?

660
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:54,843
They were right behind me.

661
01:00:09,803 --> 01:00:12,201
Sweetie, move back.

662
01:00:44,328 --> 01:00:46,342
Come on, breathe!

663
01:01:50,117 --> 01:01:51,555
Come on, everybody.

664
01:01:54,433 --> 01:01:55,775
Come on.

665
01:02:11,983 --> 01:02:14,476
You were never on the swim team.

666
01:02:15,339 --> 01:02:16,874
Nope.

667
01:02:44,398 --> 01:02:46,891
Think we got a hallway here.

668
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,111
Let's go.

669
01:02:51,303 --> 01:02:54,371
All right. Come on, come on.
There we go. There we go.

670
01:02:57,728 --> 01:02:58,687
Here.

671
01:02:59,934 --> 01:03:01,948
Conor, go back to Dylan!

672
01:03:02,811 --> 01:03:04,921
Hang on a second.
Wait, wait, wait!

673
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:07,414
What is it?

674
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,305
- It's a rescue.
- Hello!

675
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,703
- Hey, hello! Hello!
- Hello!

676
01:03:14,894 --> 01:03:17,100
- Hello!
- We're inside!

677
01:03:17,196 --> 01:03:18,635
- Hello!
- Is anybody there?

678
01:03:18,826 --> 01:03:20,265
- Hello!
- Hello!

679
01:03:20,361 --> 01:03:23,526
- Hey, we're here!
- Can you hear us?

680
01:03:25,156 --> 01:03:27,362
- Hello!
- We're here!

681
01:03:28,129 --> 01:03:30,143
Hello? What is it?

682
01:03:30,622 --> 01:03:32,061
It's nothing.

683
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,311
Flash fire.

684
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:06,490
Superheats the air.
Burns the lungs like rice paper.

685
01:04:10,326 --> 01:04:12,052
Hey, guys. Down here. Down here.

686
01:04:20,108 --> 01:04:23,177
- What do you got?
- Down this corridor is the bow, right?

687
01:04:23,369 --> 01:04:26,725
There's an access hatch right there
that puts us into the bow-thruster room.

688
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:30,465
We get into the propeller tubes and the
only thing between us and the outside...

689
01:04:30,657 --> 01:04:32,479
- ...is nothing.
- All right. Let's go.

690
01:04:32,671 --> 01:04:34,589
Let's go. That's our way out.

691
01:04:41,494 --> 01:04:43,988
All the way to the end, and up the hatch.

692
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:54,153
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

693
01:04:54,345 --> 01:04:55,592
Conor!

694
01:05:02,593 --> 01:05:05,757
- Bow's underwater.
- What does that mean?

695
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:08,539
- The thrusters are under there.
- How far? Maybe we can swim.

696
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,936
No. It's too far.

697
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:14,101
There's something else we can do, right?

698
01:05:14,197 --> 01:05:16,019
What do you think?

699
01:05:17,266 --> 01:05:18,416
Hey.

700
01:05:22,924 --> 01:05:24,554
All right.

701
01:05:24,746 --> 01:05:27,431
All right, we gotta get back up
to high ground.

702
01:05:28,486 --> 01:05:30,980
We're gonna find another way out of here.
Break into twos.

703
01:05:31,171 --> 01:05:34,720
Everybody start looking for
an emergency exit, any exit. Let's go.

704
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:44,981
Come on.

705
01:06:07,135 --> 01:06:09,245
Have you found anything?

706
01:06:09,436 --> 01:06:13,177
Nothing. There's just no way out.

707
01:06:38,303 --> 01:06:43,290
You know, there's nothing fair
about who lives and dies.

708
01:06:43,482 --> 01:06:45,975
You gave Elena a chance.

709
01:06:46,838 --> 01:06:49,140
You gave everybody a chance.

710
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:52,401
You did great.

711
01:07:22,993 --> 01:07:25,870
- What is that?
- Oh, my God, not again. Conor!

712
01:08:00,779 --> 01:08:02,026
Conor!

713
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,424
Maggie!

714
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:40,674
That cleared the bow!
Come on, let's go! Come on.

715
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:42,880
We can get out now.

716
01:08:43,935 --> 01:08:45,469
Come on.

717
01:08:51,703 --> 01:08:53,525
You go.

718
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:00,718
Maggie! Maggie!

719
01:09:01,964 --> 01:09:03,595
Maggie!

720
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:06,280
Maggie!

721
01:09:08,006 --> 01:09:09,924
Oh, my God.

722
01:09:10,116 --> 01:09:12,897
Maggie. Maggie. Hey, hey.

723
01:09:12,993 --> 01:09:15,583
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

724
01:09:16,254 --> 01:09:17,788
- Conor! Conor!
- Are you okay?

725
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:22,296
Maggie, we'll find him. We'll find him.
Come on. Come on!

726
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:23,638
Conor!

727
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:43,106
That's gotta be the propeller tube.

728
01:09:43,586 --> 01:09:46,271
Come on!
Come on, look for an opening.

729
01:10:02,862 --> 01:10:04,301
What is that?

730
01:10:07,753 --> 01:10:10,534
No. No. No. No, Nelson, don't!

731
01:10:15,905 --> 01:10:17,439
- I got him. Come on.
- Lift.

732
01:10:17,535 --> 01:10:19,453
Pick him up. Ease back.

733
01:10:20,796 --> 01:10:22,522
Watch his head.

734
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:43,525
- Conor!
- Conor!

735
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:45,155
Mom!

736
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,608
Mom!

737
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:50,622
Conor!

738
01:10:57,335 --> 01:10:59,349
Chris. Chris, come here!

739
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:02,322
You gotta hurry,
the water's rising fast!

740
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:05,103
I wanna show you something. Here.

741
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,500
Here. Take a look at this.

742
01:11:11,336 --> 01:11:14,789
The control room for these engines
is down this ladder...

743
01:11:14,981 --> 01:11:16,899
...and through about
150 feet of water.

744
01:11:16,995 --> 01:11:19,296
We have to get there and shut them off.

745
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:21,790
No. No, look, we'll grab a bunch
of this junk, right?

746
01:11:21,886 --> 01:11:24,475
We throw it up into the props,
and it'll jam everything up.

747
01:11:24,667 --> 01:11:27,832
The propellers are turning the wrong way.
It'll kick everything back in.

748
01:11:28,023 --> 01:11:30,133
Chris, we need to shut them off.

749
01:11:31,572 --> 01:11:33,682
- Conor!
- Conor!

750
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,038
Honey.

751
01:11:38,285 --> 01:11:41,066
- Honey!
- I'm in here!

752
01:11:41,162 --> 01:11:43,368
- Conor?
- Mom!

753
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:48,546
Maggie, here!

754
01:11:50,656 --> 01:11:51,807
Honey!

755
01:11:54,876 --> 01:11:56,698
Oh, God. Oh, honey.

756
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:00,055
- How'd you get in there?
- I don't know, but the water's really high.

757
01:12:00,247 --> 01:12:03,411
Look at me. Dylan's here,
and we're gonna get you out, okay?

758
01:12:03,603 --> 01:12:06,001
Oh, my God, he's gone under! Conor!

759
01:12:06,576 --> 01:12:09,837
Okay, look at me. Look at me.
Stay with me, okay?

760
01:12:09,933 --> 01:12:12,234
I can't, I can't. I can't stay up.

761
01:12:12,426 --> 01:12:16,262
- I can't find an access hatch.
- Baby, look at me. Look at me.

762
01:12:16,454 --> 01:12:18,660
- I can't, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

763
01:12:18,756 --> 01:12:20,386
- I can't stay up, Mom.
- Yes, you can.

764
01:12:34,388 --> 01:12:37,457
But no one can swim that far.
We'll find another way.

765
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:40,717
You know how much I love you.

766
01:12:42,348 --> 01:12:44,649
Yes. Yes, but don't do this.

767
01:12:45,129 --> 01:12:48,485
- Dad. Dad, please!
- You're not gonna make it, sir.

768
01:12:48,677 --> 01:12:53,185
You just won't! I mean, come on,
it's ridiculous. It's too far, you know it.

769
01:12:53,376 --> 01:12:56,733
But I think that I could make it.
I think I could do it on one breath.

770
01:12:56,829 --> 01:12:59,130
How would you get back?
You'd already be out of air.

771
01:12:59,322 --> 01:13:00,953
One of us has to do this, all right?

772
01:13:01,049 --> 01:13:04,309
It has to be the one that has the best
chance of making it, and that's me.

773
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:07,282
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- Dad.

774
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:09,967
You're not.

775
01:13:11,598 --> 01:13:13,036
Chris...

776
01:13:14,954 --> 01:13:17,927
- ...thank you.
- Yeah.

777
01:13:23,777 --> 01:13:26,559
Baby, I need you to tell me
that you love me.

778
01:13:29,723 --> 01:13:32,409
I need to hear it. It's all that matters.

779
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:44,588
Sir, I need you to tell me how I...

780
01:13:46,698 --> 01:13:48,328
Daddy!

781
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,589
No! Daddy!

782
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:09,427
- Nothing.
- No, please!

783
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:15,181
Look, baby, the water's gonna rise,
and I am right here, okay?

784
01:14:15,373 --> 01:14:18,825
I'm right beside this wall
touching you, okay?

785
01:14:19,017 --> 01:14:20,264
I love you, Mom.

786
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:24,292
You have to be strong. I love you,
and I am here with you, okay?

787
01:14:29,662 --> 01:14:31,484
Dylan!

788
01:16:17,648 --> 01:16:19,950
- Oh, baby.
- Mom.

789
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:28,581
- Sweetie.
- Mom.

790
01:16:33,376 --> 01:16:35,582
Jenny. Jen, listen.

791
01:16:56,297 --> 01:16:57,639
Come on.

792
01:17:05,215 --> 01:17:06,846
Okay, it's here.

793
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:17,395
Robert! Robert!

794
01:17:23,149 --> 01:17:24,492
Dylan, over here!

795
01:17:26,218 --> 01:17:28,136
- Where's Robert?
- The engines were running.

796
01:17:28,328 --> 01:17:32,643
Control room's underwater. He wouldn't
let me go. He shut them down.

797
01:17:32,835 --> 01:17:34,657
How long? How long?!

798
01:17:39,261 --> 01:17:40,891
Wait! What's that?

799
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,428
Why are they still running?

800
01:18:07,744 --> 01:18:10,621
He reversed the engines!
He's creating suction!

801
01:18:10,813 --> 01:18:13,594
And we can throw junk up
into the props!

802
01:18:13,786 --> 01:18:15,032
He's a genius!

803
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,403
Chris! The red tank!

804
01:18:36,994 --> 01:18:39,775
Get back! Get back!

805
01:19:12,765 --> 01:19:14,300
No!

806
01:19:22,164 --> 01:19:23,794
I can't. I can't.

807
01:19:33,576 --> 01:19:34,919
No!

808
01:19:40,577 --> 01:19:42,111
Dylan!

809
01:19:52,085 --> 01:19:53,716
Get out!

810
01:20:08,005 --> 01:20:09,923
Dylan, no!

811
01:20:27,857 --> 01:20:30,830
- Come on! Give me Conor!
- I'll take him.

812
01:20:33,323 --> 01:20:36,008
Come on! Stay there.

813
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:46,558
Jen, come on, we gotta go.

814
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:49,818
Jen, we gotta go now. Come on.

815
01:21:26,165 --> 01:21:27,412
We gotta jump.

816
01:21:41,893 --> 01:21:43,140
Get to the raft.

817
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:46,401
Got it?
Hold on tight, honey!

818
01:21:55,799 --> 01:21:58,484
Can you grab him? Grab him.
You got him?

819
01:22:12,102 --> 01:22:14,884
- Guys, move!
- Oh, my God!

820
01:22:15,075 --> 01:22:17,185
- No! Come on!
- Climb up!

821
01:22:21,117 --> 01:22:22,556
Come on!

822
01:22:23,994 --> 01:22:25,529
Come on, paddle!

823
01:22:26,296 --> 01:22:27,734
Paddle!

824
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:30,420
Mom!

825
01:23:36,976 --> 01:23:38,606
Ready?

826
01:23:39,565 --> 01:23:41,100
Flare!

827
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:26,653
- Mom!
- There. There they are!

828
01:24:27,133 --> 01:24:28,955
- Yeah!
- Look, Mom!

829
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,544
- Oh, baby.
- Mom.

830
01:24:34,805 --> 01:24:36,339
Mom!

831
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,218
We're over here!
