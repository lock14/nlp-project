1
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:02,203
Heavenly Father, we come before Thee,

2
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:05,345
knee bent and body bowed

3
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:07,836
in the humblest way
that we know how.

4
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:11,611
Father, who controls
and knows all things,

5
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:16,382
both the living
and dying of all creatures.

6
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:21,291
Give us the strength and the wisdom
to do Thy work.

7
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:23,795
ln God's name we pray.

8
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:27,197
And all God's people say, ''Amen.''

9
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:28,825
- Amen.

10
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:51,147
When Agave sobered up,

11
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:53,021
she looked down and saw
the head of her son Pentheus

12
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:56,119
- right there in her hands.
- She thought he was a wild animal.

13
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:57,993
That's how Dionysus got his revenge.

14
00:01:58,064 --> 00:02:00,396
You a heathen, Henry.

15
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:01,957
You know what l got right here?

16
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:04,629
- What?
- Some of that very wine.

17
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:09,971
''When l was a child, l soake as a child.

18
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,514
''l understood as a child.

19
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:18,050
''l thought as a child.

20
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:21,211
''But when l became a man,

21
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,813
l put away all childish things.''

22
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,649
Freshman class...

23
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:54,779
l believe we are the most privileged
people in America,

24
00:02:54,888 --> 00:03:00,827
because we have
the most important job

25
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:03,158
in America:

26
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,257
the education of our young people.

27
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,154
Trudell!

28
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,099
- Who the hell is he?
- Oh, he's just my husband.

29
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,070
l'm gonna cut your head off.

30
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,442
We must impress upon our young people

31
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:56,471
that there will be difficulties
that they face.

32
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,609
Come on, Trudell.
Come get this whuppin', boy.

33
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:00,652
- Get him down, Trudell.
- Scared, ain't ya?

34
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:02,847
Huh? You with the razor
and twice my size?

35
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:05,288
They must defeat them!

36
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:15,264
They must do what they have to do
in order to do what they want to do.

37
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:17,269
Come on, now.

38
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:18,895
Come on, baby!

39
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:24,910
Education is the only way out.

40
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:29,477
Come on, baby. Get up!
Get up, baby. Come on!

41
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,450
The way out of ignorance--

42
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,180
Like cuttin' people, huh, boy?

43
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:36,255
Want to cut people, Trudell, huh?

44
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,854
Get your hands off me!

45
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,917
The way out of darkness!

46
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:51,068
lnto...

47
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:53,935
the glorious light.

48
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,849
Come on, now! Give it back!

49
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:44,287
- Give it back!
- ''To our precious Hamilton--''

50
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:46,621
This isn't funny. Come on.
Dunbar, give it back.

51
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,628
Who do you think you are?
Jesse Owens?

52
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,341
Have a seat.

53
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:18,524
''l am...

54
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,253
''the darker brother.

55
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,818
''They send me to eat in the kitchen
when company comes.

56
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:26,297
''But l laugh, and l eat well,

57
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:29,436
''and l grow strong.

58
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:32,997
''Tomorrow, l will sit at the table
when company comes.

59
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:35,064
''Nobody'll dare say to me,

60
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:37,109
'''Eat in the kitchen' then.

61
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:42,114
''Besides, they'll see how beautiful l am,

62
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:44,673
''and be ashamed.

63
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:49,188
l, too, am America.''

64
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:51,280
Who wrote that?

65
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,159
Langston Hughes, 1924.

66
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,662
1925.

67
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:05,327
''Hating you shall be a game
played with cool hands.''

68
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:11,543
''Memory will lay its hands
upon your breast,

69
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:15,843
and you will understand my hatred.''

70
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,543
Gwendolyn Bennett wrote that.

71
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:21,755
She was born in 1902.

72
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:24,383
Unofficially.

73
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,254
You see, in most states,

74
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,123
Negroes were denied birth certificates,

75
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,788
which means l can
lie about my age the rest of my life.

76
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:34,496
You think that's funny?

77
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,299
To be born...

78
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,498
without record.

79
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:44,405
Mr. Reed, hand these out.

80
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:47,105
l'm going to introduce you
to some new voices this semester.

81
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,546
There's a revolution going on.

82
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,947
ln the North. ln Harlem.

83
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,576
They're changing the way
Negroes in America think.

84
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:57,884
l'm talking about poets
like Hughes, Bennett,

85
00:07:57,957 --> 00:08:00,323
Zora Neale Hurston, Countee Cullen--

86
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,985
''Some are teethed on a silver spoon,

87
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,827
''with the stars strung up for a rattle.

88
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:08,231
''l cut my teeth
as a black raccoon--

89
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,735
...for implements of battle.''

90
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,935
Meet me after class.

91
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:33,752
What's a professor doing
in the middle of the night

92
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,488
dressed like a cotton-chopper?

93
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:37,621
What is a student doing
in the middle of the night

94
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:38,857
throwing his life away?

95
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,900
lt's funny. l thought
l was defending myself.

96
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,333
Mm.

97
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:46,600
l remember you.

98
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:49,335
Couple of years ago.
Then you disappeared.

99
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:50,501
What happened?

100
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:53,375
l come and go whenever it suits me.

101
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:55,505
- Suspensions?
- Leaves of absence.

102
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,850
Why'd you come back?

103
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:01,284
School's the only place
you can read all day.

104
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,322
Except prison.

105
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,986
l want you to come by
my house tonight, 7:30.

106
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:09,995
- Corner of June and Campus.
- Why would l do that?

107
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,293
Holding tryouts for the debate team.

108
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:17,998
- You sure you want somebody like me?
- No.

109
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:20,631
That's why you're trying out.

110
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:22,197
7:30.

111
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,038
June and Campus.

112
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:53,096
''Driven by the wind and tossed--''

113
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,400
Do well tonight, Junior.

114
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:04,112
Of the 360 students here at Wiley College,

115
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:08,313
only 45 of you were brave enough
to try out for the debate team.

116
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:11,117
Of that 45, only four
of you will remain standing

117
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,283
when the tryouts are over-- why?

118
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:16,487
Because debate is
blood sport. lt's combat.

119
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,723
But your weapons are words.

120
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,163
Come on in.

121
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,394
Now that Mr. Farmer
has joined us, we can begin.

122
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:23,765
Sit down, Mr. Farmer.

123
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:26,202
Not right there. Over there.

124
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:28,103
- Yes, sir.
- James. Right this way.

125
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:30,233
Good evening, Mrs. Tolson.

126
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,278
- Evening.
- Excuse me.

127
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:33,744
We're waiting for you, Mr. Farmer.

128
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:35,280
l'm going, sir.

129
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:38,748
Thank you, Mr. Farmer.
You smell very good, Mr. Farmer.

130
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,184
- Thank you, sir.
- You're very welcome.

131
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:43,051
Gentlemen and lady.

132
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:45,352
This is...

133
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:49,418
the hot spot.

134
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:53,363
You will enter it at your own risk.

135
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,628
Mr. Tolson, what about
the debaters from last year?

136
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:57,192
Don't ask a question you
already know the answer to.

137
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,532
Get up here. You'll be first.

138
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:00,196
Get right here. Hot spot.

139
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:02,298
Debate starts with a proposition.

140
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,899
With an idea-- ''Resolved:

141
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:07,708
Child labor should be regulated
by the federal government.''

142
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,839
The first debater argues
the affirmative.

143
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:11,576
Affirmative means
that you are for something.

144
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:13,208
Mr. Reed will argue the affirmative.

145
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,946
The second debater
argues the negative.

146
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:16,487
Negative means that you are what?

147
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:17,488
Against.

148
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:19,388
Brilliant, Mr. Burgess.

149
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,428
You shall argue
the affirmative, Mr. Reed. Go.

150
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,989
Well, sir, l'd begin with a quote
from the poet Cleghorn.

151
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:31,264
''The golf links lie so near the mill,

152
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:34,636
''that almost every day,

153
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:38,302
''the laboring children
can look out and--

154
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:40,243
and--''

155
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,618
ls that what you learned
from last year, Mr. Reed?

156
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:48,950
To start something,
and not finish it?

157
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:50,580
- ls it?
- No, sir.

158
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,351
Sit down.

159
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:58,854
Who's next? You? Stand up.

160
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,331
Stand up.

161
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:05,135
lt's getting late.
How much longer can you hide?

162
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:07,638
l'm not hiding, sir.
l transferred from my college

163
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:09,334
just to come here
and try out for your team.

164
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:10,740
l am deeply moved. What's your name?

165
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,300
Samantha Booke.

166
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:13,675
- Book?
- With an ''e.''

167
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:17,204
Arise, Miss Booke. With an ''e.''

168
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:22,654
lnto the hot spot,
Miss Booke with an ''e.''

169
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:26,715
You know, there's never been a female
on the debating team, ever.

170
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:28,420
Yes, sir. l know that.

171
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:30,860
What makes you think
you should be the first?

172
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,194
Because, sir, l am just as qualified as--

173
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,995
- Quit stammering, Miss Booke.
- ...anybody else here.

174
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:36,797
- My gender has nothing--
- ''Resolved:

175
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:39,633
Welfare discourages hard work.''

176
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:42,833
- You'll argue the negative.
- All right.

177
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:46,606
Welfare takes away a man's
strongest reason for working,

178
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,273
which is survival.

179
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,940
And that weakens the will of the poor.

180
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,153
How would you rebut that,
Miss Booke with an ''e''?

181
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:56,246
l would say it does not.

182
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:59,415
Most of the New Deal
goes to children, anyway,

183
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,653
and to the handicapped,
and to old people--

184
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:03,160
- ls that fact, or conjecture?
- lt is a fact.

185
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:05,629
- Speak up.
- lt is a fact.

186
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,461
- What's your source?
- The president.

187
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,899
- Of the United States?
- Yes, sir.

188
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:13,132
That's your primary source? You spoke
to President Roosevelt personally?

189
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,606
Of course not. l did not
speak to him personally,

190
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,267
but l listened to his Fireside Chat.

191
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:20,244
- Oh, a radio broadcast.
- Yes.

192
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:22,474
- Any other sources?
- Well--

193
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,550
Any other sources?

194
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:28,979
Yes, there are other sources.

195
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:31,784
Like that look in a mother's eyes
when she can't feed her kids.

196
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:35,294
Without welfare, Mr. Tolson,
people would be starving.

197
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:36,521
Who's starving, Miss Booke?

198
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:38,962
- The unemployed are starving.
- Mr. Burgess here.

199
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:41,397
He's unemployed.
Obviously, he's not starving.

200
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:45,500
l drew you in, Miss Booke.

201
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:49,302
You gave a faulty premise,
so your syllogism fell apart.

202
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,309
- ''Syllogism''?
- Your logic fell apart.

203
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,345
Major premise:
the unemployed are starving.

204
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:55,903
Minor premise:
Mr. Burgess is unemployed.

205
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,506
Conclusion: Mr. Burgess is starving.

206
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,451
Your major premise was
based on a faulty assumption.

207
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:04,319
Classic fallacy. Who's next?

208
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,858
You were right.

209
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,161
Tell us your name.

210
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:17,532
l'm Henry Lowe. With an ''e.''

211
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:21,540
All right, Mr. Lowe. l will name a subject.

212
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:24,303
You speak a few words--
a pertinent quote from world literature.

213
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:25,605
Go ahead.

214
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:28,938
Beauty.

215
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,440
''l heard the old, old men say,

216
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:34,918
all that is beautiful
drifts away, like the waters.''

217
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:37,387
Very good.

218
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:40,653
History. And name
the author this time.

219
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:43,820
''History is a nightmare,
from which l am trying to awake.''

220
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:45,261
James Joyce.

221
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,028
Self-pity.

222
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:57,504
''l never saw a wild thing
sorry for itself.''

223
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:58,874
D.H. Lawrence.

224
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,513
l love D.H. Lawrence. Have you ever read--

225
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:04,607
Mr. Farmer.

226
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:06,776
Yes, sir?

227
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:10,322
l have eyes in the back of my head
and ears on both sides. Stand up.

228
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:17,127
Tell me the irony in the name
''Bethlehem Steel Corporation.''

229
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:23,465
Bethlehem is the birthplace of Jesus,
Prince of Peace,

230
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:26,369
and Bethlehem Steel
makes weapons of war.

231
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,907
Very good. Sit down.

232
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:31,065
Good.

233
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,838
Who's next?

234
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:34,776
That went well.
How will we know how we did?

235
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:37,509
- Samantha.

236
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:41,053
Samantha.

237
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:45,617
Tolson's tough, isn't he?

238
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:47,682
He sure is.

239
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:51,761
l'm James.

240
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,890
ls your father Dr. James Farmer?

241
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:55,957
Yes... yes, he is.

242
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:59,436
l'm taking theology from him,
and that man speaks in tongues.

243
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:01,564
French, Greek, Hebrew, Latin--

244
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:03,302
How many languages
does he speak?

245
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:07,472
- Seven languages.
- ''Seven languages.''

246
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:10,379
He must be the smartest man in Texas.

247
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:12,383
Well, that's not saying much.

248
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,488
So why do you want
to be on the team?

249
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:20,150
- l think it would be good training.
- For what?

250
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:22,558
Bein' a lawyer.

251
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,188
Lawyer? That's great.

252
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:28,131
You know how many Negro
women practice law in this state?

253
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,462
- Two.
- Exactly.

254
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,560
One of them's my aunt.

255
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:34,265
Well, look at you, Mr. Farmer.

256
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,898
How old are you, anyway?

257
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:38,569
l'll be 16...

258
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:39,906
in 21 months.

259
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:44,313
Young lady. James.
l just wanted to thank you.

260
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,112
For what?

261
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:47,810
Well, for your performance tonight.

262
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,979
l mean, how many other students
ever stand up to Tolson?

263
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,351
- l did.
- No.

264
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:54,723
You answered a question,
and l spouted a few quotes.

265
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,819
Miss Booke with an ''e,''

266
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:59,831
- she fought back.
- And lost!

267
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,060
But you didn't have to lose.

268
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:05,228
Why isn't a Fireside Chat
a legitimate source?

269
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,704
Because Tolson says so?

270
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:12,437
Nobody has better access
to those statistics than the president.

271
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:16,914
Now, if you'd have called Tolson on that,
you would have won.

272
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:21,749
l don't know. l'm sure that man
would have come up with something.

273
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:23,584
Good night, James.

274
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:25,317
Can you believe he's

275
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,450
- Good night, Samantha.
- 1 4 years old, and he's in college?

276
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:32,526
You are gifted, all of you.

277
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:35,066
So l want you to know that l chose
this team for balance,

278
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:38,160
and none of you should
take it as a failure...

279
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:40,364
as a denigration of your intellect.

280
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,770
Denigrate. There's a word for you.

281
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,776
From the Latin word ''niger,''
to defame, to blacken.

282
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,869
lt's always there, isn't it?
Even in the dictionary.

283
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:50,404
Even in the speech
of a Negro professor.

284
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:54,646
Somehow, ''black'' is always
equated with failure.

285
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:57,279
Well, write your own dictionary.

286
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,858
And mark this as a new beginning,

287
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:02,655
whether you make the team or not.

288
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:07,893
The Wiley College Forensics
Society of 1935-1936 is as follows:

289
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,595
The debaters...

290
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:13,467
will be Mr. Hamilton Burgess
from last year's team--

291
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:17,270
- Yea!
- Sit down, Mr. Burgess.

292
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:21,474
Mr. Henry Lowe.

293
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,447
Our alternates.

294
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:26,882
Miss Samantha Booke. With an ''e.''

295
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,882
And finally--

296
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,488
Junior, slow down.

297
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,653
- Where's Dad?
- Quiet. He's writing a lecture.

298
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,667
- Dad.
- Junior.

299
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:45,932
What is the greatest
weakness of man?

300
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:50,601
Not believing? Doubt?

301
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,068
That's it. Thank you, Junior.

302
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:56,774
Matthew 1 4:31 .

303
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,476
- That will be the lesson.
- Dad.

304
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:04,522
''O you of little faith,
why do you doubt me?''

305
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,318
Dad?

306
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:07,791
What is it, son?

307
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,385
l made the debate team.

308
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,556
Well, congratulations.

309
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,531
And who is on your team?

310
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,967
Um, there's four of us.
l'm one of the alternates.

311
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:19,960
Who's ahead of you?

312
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,530
Hamilton Burgess and Henry Lowe.

313
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:25,236
And the other alternate's
Samantha Booke.

314
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,972
There's a girl?

315
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,241
She wants to be a lawyer.

316
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,112
- A lawyer?
- She's very intelligent.

317
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:36,814
ls she pretty?

318
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:40,187
l don't know.
l never really noticed.

319
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,285
Because extracurricular activities
like the debate team are fine,

320
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:45,796
but you must not take
your eye off the ball, son.

321
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:49,164
- Yes, sir.
- Hmph.

322
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:52,102
So what do we do here?

323
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:55,504
We do what we have to do,
so we can do what we want to do.

324
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:58,008
What do you have to do right now?

325
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:59,908
- My homework.
- So get to it.

326
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,571
Yes, sir.

327
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:14,258
My daddy owns a grocery store
that has apples, bananas, cookies,

328
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,226
doughnuts, eggs, figs,

329
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,490
and ''gonzola'' beans.

330
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:21,431
Right. What's a gonzola bean?

331
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,559
- Hogwash!
- Hogwash!

332
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:24,660
''Gonzola'' bean?

333
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,806
Ready, set, go!

334
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:30,832
- Apricots, uh--
- Hogwash.

335
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,377
What, no apricots?

336
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:34,674
Look out!

337
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,917
What was that?

338
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:41,748
l'm not sure.

339
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,697
Sit down.

340
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:55,199
- You stay put.

341
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,258
Be still.

342
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:06,577
What is it?

343
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:08,306
lt's a pig.

344
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,075
- Hit a pig.

345
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:11,911
Shut up, dog!

346
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:13,746
Junior, get in the car.

347
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:15,786
What the hell happened to my hog?

348
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:18,186
Sorry about that.
Came out of nowhere.

349
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:19,451
l didn't see it coming.

350
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:21,425
You done killed my hog, boy.

351
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:24,121
Truly sorry. Gladly pay you for it.

352
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:27,063
How much--
How much you want?

353
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:31,328
lt's gonna cost you $25.

354
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:35,333
Only have a few bucks on me
right now, but l can--

355
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:45,809
l do have a check.

356
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:47,977
My monthly check,
for Wiley College in Marshall.

357
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:51,318
lt's for $1 7.36.

358
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,654
You may have that.

359
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:55,660
l will endorse that over to you.

360
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,224
You'll do what?

361
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,392
l will sign the check over to you.

362
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:05,062
Well, let me see it.

363
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:08,629
lt's in the car, with my wife.

364
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:11,198
Gonna walk to the car now.

365
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:16,972
Junior, get in the car.

366
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:26,057
Give me that salary check, Pearl.

367
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,888
We need that money, James.

368
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,120
Just give me the check.

369
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:31,389
Go on.

370
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:35,893
His wife has it.

371
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:38,597
l thought it was in here.

372
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,229
Just relax. lt's all right.

373
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:41,636
lt's in here. You'll find it.

374
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:46,577
Here it is.

375
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:51,343
Here it is.

376
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,487
That check better be good, boy.

377
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:58,556
lt's good.

378
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,126
Well, pick it up!

379
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:22,444
Here it is.

380
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:24,311
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where the hell do you think you're going?

381
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,283
You got to help us
get this hog in my truck.

382
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:29,149
Come on. Grab the tail end of that, boy.

383
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,649
All right, on three.

384
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:37,355
One, two, three!

385
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,091
Town niggers. They think
they're too good to get their hands dirty.

386
00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:00,682
- Dad--
- l told you to get in the car.

387
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:03,788
When l tell you to do
something, Junior, you do it.

388
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:07,950
Who's the judge?

389
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,550
The judge is God.

390
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:10,925
Why is he God?

391
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:13,430
Because he decides
who wins or loses,

392
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:14,591
not my opponent.

393
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,690
Who is your opponent?

394
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:17,235
He doesn't exist.

395
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:18,929
Why does he not exist?

396
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:21,768
He's merely a dissenting voice
to the truth l speak.

397
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:23,669
Who's the judge?

398
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:25,677
- The judge is God!
- The judge is God!

399
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:27,201
Why is he God?

400
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,612
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent!

401
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:31,614
Who is your opponent?

402
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:33,480
He doesn't exist!

403
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:35,143
Why doesn't he exist?

404
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:38,883
Because he is merely a dissenting voice
to the truth l speak!

405
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:41,782
Who's the judge?

406
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,259
The judge is God!

407
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:44,556
Why is he God?

408
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,396
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent!

409
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:49,661
Who's your opponent?

410
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:50,929
He doesn't exist!

411
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:52,527
Why does he not exist?

412
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:56,131
Because he is merely a dissenting voice
to the truth l speak!

413
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,505
Who's the judge?

414
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:58,634
The judge is God!

415
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,540
Louder!

416
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:01,135
The judge is God!

417
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,338
Why is he God?

418
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:05,646
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent!

419
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:06,706
Who's your opponent?

420
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:07,911
He doesn't exist!

421
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,248
Why does he not exist?

422
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:12,950
Because he is merely a dissenting voice
to the truth l speak!

423
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:13,992
Speak the truth!

424
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:15,390
Speak the truth!

425
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,018
Yes, sir, l do like to talk.

426
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:18,960
ls that a virtue or a vice?

427
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:23,798
Well, l have to admit l've always wanted
to be the quiet, mysterious type,

428
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:25,962
only l couldn't keep
my mouth shut long enough.

429
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:28,871
Would you punch yourself
in a street fight, Mr. Burgess?

430
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:31,301
No, sir.

431
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:33,071
Then don't punch yourself in a word fight.

432
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:34,806
You don't have to make fun of yourself.

433
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,817
Use your humor against your opponent.

434
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:41,079
Mr. Farmer!

435
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:42,210
Yes, sir.

436
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:45,613
Happy Mr. Farmer.

437
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:48,022
Tell us one thing we don't
know about your father.

438
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:49,321
He was the first Negro Ph.--

439
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:52,761
One thing we don't know
about your father, Mr. Farmer.

440
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:00,900
He walked from Florida to Massachusetts
to go to college at Boston University.

441
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,166
He graduated magna cum laude.

442
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:05,301
Mr. Lowe!

443
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:10,542
Tell us about your father.

444
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:13,209
Why don't you tell us something
about your father?

445
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:15,377
We're trying to get
to know each other, Mr. Lowe.

446
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:17,478
l was trying to get
to know you, Mr. Tolson.

447
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:19,352
l'm not the one on the debate team.

448
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,892
Are we not engaged
in a debate right now?

449
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:25,258
All right.

450
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,389
l'll take the affirmative.

451
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:34,864
Take the meanest...
most restless nigger,

452
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,908
strip him of his clothes

453
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:39,170
in front of the remaining male niggers,
female niggers,

454
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:40,404
and nigger infants.

455
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:42,310
Tar and feather him.

456
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:45,475
Tie each leg to a horse
facing an opposite direction,

457
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:46,710
set him on fire,

458
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:50,254
and beat both horses
until they tear him apart

459
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:53,689
in front of the male,
female, and nigger infants.

460
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,695
Bullwhip and beat
the remaining nigger males

461
00:26:57,763 --> 00:26:59,128
within an inch of their life.

462
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:01,927
Do not kill them, but put
the fear of God in them,

463
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:04,663
for they can be useful for future breeding.

464
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:06,398
Anybody know
who Willie Lynch was?

465
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:07,870
Anybody? Raise your hand.

466
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,134
No one?

467
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:11,471
He was a vicious slave owner
in the West lndies.

468
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:13,977
The slave-masters
in the colony of Virginia

469
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:16,378
were having trouble
controlling their slaves,

470
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:19,939
so they sent for Mr. Lynch
to teach them his methods.

471
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:23,544
The word ''lynching''
came from his last name.

472
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:27,853
His methods were very simple,
but they were diabolical.

473
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:31,987
Keep the slave physically strong
but psychologically weak

474
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:33,759
and dependent on the slave master.

475
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:37,233
Keep the body, take the mind.

476
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,867
l...and every other
professor on this campus

477
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:46,570
are here to help you...

478
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:51,382
to find, take back,

479
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,819
and keep your righteous mind...

480
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:59,550
because obviously you have lost it.

481
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,156
That's all you need to know about me,
Mr. Lowe.

482
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,525
Class dismissed.

483
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,318
Hey!

484
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:55,731
Here you go, honey.

485
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:56,796
Thank you.

486
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,442
Want to dance?

487
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:00,739
Yes.

488
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,108
Come on.

489
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:21,361
You're a good dancer.

490
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,162
Thank you. l--

491
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,760
l practice in my room.

492
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:27,771
Keep at it.

493
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:30,540
Excuse me.

494
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:32,167
Your punch.

495
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:34,303
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

496
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,973
l guess l better go
get me some punch.

497
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:40,813
Here, you can have mine if you want.

498
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,012
lt's good.

499
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,679
All right?

500
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:49,919
You know l can take you to a place

501
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:51,121
that plays real music, right?

502
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:53,027
l'm not leaving here, Henry.

503
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:54,030
Just for a spell.

504
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,760
l'll bring you right back.

505
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:59,031
And what would my chaperone say?

506
00:30:59,104 --> 00:31:01,129
We'll be back before she
ever knows you're gone.

507
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:03,400
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

508
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:08,969
What's the matter? You afraid?

509
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:20,723
What's the matter?

510
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,123
You afraid?

511
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:32,168
Excuse me.

512
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:06,336
Mr. Tolson?

513
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:31,194
Mr. Tolson!

514
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:31,915
lt's time. Let's go.

515
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:42,091
...break your back all day.

516
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:45,965
And it's not right
when they lie to the government

517
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:48,870
and tell them that sharecroppers
are just wage earners

518
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,670
so they don't have to split
their farmer's subsidies with you.

519
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:54,268
And that's why
the Southern Tenant Farmers Union

520
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:55,608
wants you to organize:

521
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,045
to make things right.

522
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:58,673
How? Strike?

523
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:00,683
Hell, they'll just bring in the Mexicans.

524
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:01,819
We'll organize them, too.

525
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,889
Yeah, so they can shoot us all down:
white, colored, and Mexican.

526
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:06,550
That's exactly what they
want you to believe.

527
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,616
The farm bosses
want you to believe they'll make war.

528
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:11,719
They won't. They may be fools,
but they're smart businessmen.

529
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:13,161
And once we're organized,

530
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:15,028
they'll see even guns can't stop us.

531
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,397
Stopped them in Elaine.

532
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:17,901
Why don't you talk about that?

533
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,665
About how they killed
a hundred colored sharecroppers

534
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,899
for trying to organize.

535
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,065
That was 1919, friend.

536
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:26,508
And that was my daddy
they gunned down, friend.

537
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:27,806
We're sorry about that.

538
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:29,847
But those men stood alone.

539
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:31,211
That's my point.

540
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:33,011
This is 1935.

541
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:34,915
We've got the National
Labor Relations Board.

542
00:34:34,986 --> 00:34:36,283
We've got the AF of L.

543
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:37,787
You ain't got shit!

544
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:39,448
He ain't got shit!

545
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,336
Here they come!
Here they come!

546
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:55,134
Get the lights! Everybody get down!

547
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:56,935
Get down. Shh!

548
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:03,612
Shh!

549
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,743
Come on!

550
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:50,929
Let's get out of here!

551
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:53,159
This way! This way! This way!

552
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:54,289
Come on!

553
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:13,144
Come on. Come on!

554
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:27,728
Come on!

555
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,767
All right. All right.

556
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:35,504
What are you doing out here? Huh?

557
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:37,632
l saw you-- l was
walking by your house,

558
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:39,040
and l saw you dressed funny.

559
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,236
l'm dressed like them, son.

560
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:43,405
You think they'd listen to me
if l was wearing a tuxedo? Huh?

561
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:44,413
No, sir.

562
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:45,505
Listen to me.

563
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:46,743
You listening?

564
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:49,217
You cannot tell anybody
what you saw tonight.

565
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:50,254
You understand?

566
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:51,879
Not even my wife
knows about this.

567
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,457
l won't tell anybody, l promise.

568
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:55,253
l promise on a stack of Bibles--

569
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:56,258
Jesus.

570
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:57,487
... l won't tell anybody.

571
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:02,723
Come on.

572
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:40,763
Junior?

573
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:44,667
Are you just going to stand there?

574
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:47,174
No, sir.

575
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:58,419
Sorry l'm late.

576
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:01,253
You're sorry?

577
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:04,020
lt's 1 :00 in the morning.

578
00:38:04,062 --> 00:38:05,757
l've been looking everywhere for you.

579
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:08,925
l went to Mr. Tolson's
house after the dance.

580
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:13,632
l thought you might have done that.

581
00:38:13,705 --> 00:38:16,196
That's why l went over there.

582
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:18,674
And l talked to Ruth.

583
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:22,201
She said Tolson was gone
and that you weren't there.

584
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,511
So l'm going to give you another chance.

585
00:38:26,884 --> 00:38:28,545
Where were you?

586
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:30,621
l can't tell you, sir.

587
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:31,950
Good Lord, boy.

588
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:34,116
We've been worried to death about you.

589
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:35,159
Junior--

590
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:38,762
where were you?

591
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,095
l can't tell you, sir.

592
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,098
Why not?

593
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,759
l don't know.

594
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:45,996
''l don't know.''

595
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:51,097
''l don't know'' is not
an acceptable answer, Junior.

596
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:52,608
Junior.

597
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:54,736
Silence is not an option, either.

598
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:58,048
Son, you been drinking?

599
00:38:58,149 --> 00:38:59,275
Honey--

600
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:01,477
Because you must've been drinking
coming up in my house

601
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:05,145
talking about you don't want to tell me
where you been at 1 :30 in the morning?

602
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:06,451
Baby, tell me, what's the matter?

603
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:07,650
Mom, nothing's the matter.

604
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:08,749
Something's the matter!

605
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:10,851
Something is wrong!

606
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:12,190
Were you with that girl?

607
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:13,924
- You were with that girl.
- No.

608
00:39:13,998 --> 00:39:15,863
Because you're 1 4 years old, Junior.

609
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,924
You've got plenty of time for girls later.

610
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:19,196
l wasn't with Samantha.

611
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,362
Junior.

612
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:24,001
Then where were you?

613
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:29,170
Where were you, honey?

614
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:32,142
You don't want to talk?

615
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,582
Fine.

616
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:36,313
But you're not leaving this house.

617
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:37,854
What do you mean?

618
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:38,889
Just what l said.

619
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,686
You're not leaving this house
until you tell me the truth!

620
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:42,987
What about school?

621
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:44,926
Don't go questioning
what l just said, boy!

622
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:45,928
Mom, what about school?

623
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:46,929
And don't raise your voice!

624
00:39:46,998 --> 00:39:47,987
l'm not raising my voice!

625
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:49,397
You raising your voice in the house?

626
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:50,399
Apologize to your father.

627
00:39:50,468 --> 00:39:51,992
l'm not raising my voice!

628
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,401
You get a job, pay your own way?

629
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:54,438
You're a man now?

630
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:55,563
l'm not raising my voice!

631
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,698
Just apologize!

632
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:57,741
l didn't say anything!

633
00:39:57,809 --> 00:39:59,174
Why should l apologize?

634
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:01,541
Like you apologized to that pig farmer?

635
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,408
What did you say, boy?

636
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:11,949
You go to your room.

637
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:16,755
Okay, Junior--

638
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:30,273
l'm not going to be weak on this, Pearl.

639
00:40:31,476 --> 00:40:32,807
l know.

640
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:37,941
l can't allow my son to be corrupted.

641
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:39,482
You're right.

642
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:43,420
Let's just go to bed.

643
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:45,319
l'll take him to school in the morning.

644
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:46,856
All right?

645
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:49,253
All right.

646
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,904
l'm going to be honest with you, boys.

647
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:05,306
l'm not well.

648
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:07,937
l'm not well at all this morning.

649
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:09,479
l'm sure sorry to hear that, sir.

650
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:10,536
You look well to me.

651
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:11,741
Don't he look well, Sam?

652
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:13,817
Yes, sir. He looks real good.

653
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:18,322
Now, we got some white fellas
from up north come into our town.

654
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:21,358
They're stirring up trouble
between our coloreds and our whites.

655
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:23,290
They say that we need to make a union:

656
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:25,886
the sharecroppers
and the workers all together,

657
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:27,157
colored and white.

658
00:41:27,231 --> 00:41:29,062
They need to make a union?

659
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,067
How do you boys feel about that?

660
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:32,397
l don't know, sir.

661
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,461
l really ain't thought much about that.

662
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:36,507
Well, it's a bad idea.

663
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:39,065
lt's a bad idea, take my word for it.

664
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:41,043
Yes, sir.

665
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:43,672
And they say that there was
some kind of secret meeting

666
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:45,113
last night down near the lake.

667
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,740
Now, do you boys know about that?

668
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:48,250
No, sir.

669
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,446
You don't know about that?

670
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:53,183
- Samuel?
- No, sir.

671
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:54,588
- You didn't hear about that?
- No, sir.

672
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:55,956
- You swear to me?
- Yes, sir.

673
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:57,551
Yes, sir, l swear.

674
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:02,161
All right, then.

675
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:06,159
See you later.

676
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,998
Our first debate

677
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,000
is one week from today.

678
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:15,943
- One week?
- That's right.

679
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:17,674
l thought Prairie View was first.

680
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:20,615
Prairie View is tough,
so l thought we needed a warm-up.

681
00:42:20,685 --> 00:42:23,176
With the best Negro college in the state?

682
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:25,016
That's right, Mr. Burgess.

683
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:26,181
Does that frighten you?

684
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,814
Yes, sir.

685
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:30,986
One week's not enough time
to write our arguments.

686
00:42:31,062 --> 00:42:33,121
You do the research.
l'll write the arguments.

687
00:42:33,197 --> 00:42:35,062
Wait. You--

688
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:36,565
You write the arguments?

689
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:37,623
And you deliver them, Mr. Lowe.

690
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:39,431
What the hell do l look like, a mailman?

691
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:42,472
Hell is where you're headed
if you question me again.

692
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,168
ln theory, you look like a student.

693
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:47,541
So what you're saying
is l'm not capable.

694
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:48,772
lt's not a matter of competence.

695
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:49,904
lt's a matter of experience.

696
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:51,141
How do l know you write--

697
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:52,944
l write the arguments!

698
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,312
That's the way it's been!

699
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:56,784
That's the way it's going to be!

700
00:42:56,854 --> 00:42:59,550
Any more questions?

701
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:02,750
One week.

702
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:06,355
l bring to you

703
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,625
our first affirmative debater:

704
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:12,863
from Paul Quinn College,
Otheree Hubbard.

705
00:43:20,678 --> 00:43:25,081
Resolved: unemployment
relief should be ended

706
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:27,650
when the Depression ends.

707
00:43:27,752 --> 00:43:29,549
lf the Depression ends.

708
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,249
l traveled back through history to 1536,

709
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:35,815
when the first Poor Laws
of England were mandated.

710
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:39,226
ln those days, the dole--
or welfare, as we call it--

711
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:42,027
was funded by voluntary contributions.

712
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,567
But, as time passed,

713
00:43:44,635 --> 00:43:46,796
the English devised the Allowance System,

714
00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:48,839
the first unemployment relief,

715
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:52,239
only now it was paid
with involuntary contributions,

716
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,210
more commonly known as taxes.

717
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:57,878
The Allowance System was a disaster.

718
00:43:57,982 --> 00:44:00,849
The only real unemployment relief
is to give a man a job.

719
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:03,920
But to do that, you have
to give the economy life,

720
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:07,186
not tax it to death.

721
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:14,124
When capitalism was young,

722
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:16,291
the old puritanical concept of duty

723
00:44:16,367 --> 00:44:19,734
was, ''He who does not work
shall not eat.''

724
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:21,669
That made sense
when there was more work

725
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:23,434
than men willing to do it.

726
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:25,065
But those days are gone.

727
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:27,007
Now there are millions
who want to work,

728
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:28,943
but find themselves
standing in breadlines.

729
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:31,675
Now, should they not eat
because there are no jobs?

730
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:33,943
People, today we need
a new concept of duty:

731
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:37,020
the right of the individual
to demand from society

732
00:44:37,088 --> 00:44:40,023
just as much as he gives to society.

733
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:45,660
We clutch at anything that
even looks like a solution.

734
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,029
$60 million a month for public relief?

735
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,900
Pay it out if it'll sweep
the hoboes off the streets.

736
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:57,430
One seventh of the population
of the United States on welfare.

737
00:44:57,508 --> 00:44:59,840
Fine, as long as it ends our misery.

738
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,313
A nation as desperate as this
is a danger to itself.

739
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:06,373
- That's right.

740
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:10,186
Once,

741
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:14,223
a Roman general brought peace
to a rebellious province...

742
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:17,123
by killing all its citizens.

743
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:18,855
Even his fellow Romans
were shocked.

744
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:20,157
One of them wrote,

745
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:22,529
''<i>Solitudinem faciunt,</i>
<i>pacem appellant,</i> ''

746
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,832
which means ''They create desolation
and call it peace.''

747
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:29,735
Now, for all their facts and figures,

748
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:33,641
the Paul Quinn debaters would also
create desolation and call it peace.

749
00:45:33,711 --> 00:45:37,807
They would allow the unemployed to die
so the economy can live.

750
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:57,293
A brilliant young woman l know

751
00:45:57,368 --> 00:46:01,304
was asked once to support her argument
in favor of social welfare.

752
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:04,738
She named the most powerful source
imaginable:

753
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:09,007
the look in a mother's face
when she cannot feed her children.

754
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,350
Can you look that hungry
child in the eyes?

755
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:16,784
See the blood on his feet

756
00:46:16,854 --> 00:46:18,822
from walking barefoot
in the cotton fields?

757
00:46:18,923 --> 00:46:21,949
Or do you ask his baby sister
with her belly swollen from hunger

758
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:23,891
if she cares about
her daddy's work ethic?

759
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:35,227
He's good.

760
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:40,274
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

761
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:43,712
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

762
00:46:43,814 --> 00:46:46,612
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

763
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:58,384
The only thing that matters
is that big fish eat little fish,

764
00:46:58,462 --> 00:47:00,589
and the color of the fish
does not count!

765
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:06,334
lf the state of Mississippi
would have turned their heads

766
00:47:06,403 --> 00:47:08,769
each and every time
a Negro was lynched,

767
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,466
shouldn't the federal government intervene?

768
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:27,889
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

769
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,722
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

770
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:49,473
And the winner is...

771
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:54,484
Wiley College!

772
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:22,103
Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley! Wiley!

773
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:33,848
That's right, Captain.

774
00:48:33,924 --> 00:48:35,516
l think l've got the ringleader.

775
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:40,955
Uh, all right,
if that's what you want.

776
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:43,831
Yeah. Okey-dokey, then.

777
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:45,300
Bye-bye.

778
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:48,364
Shit.

779
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:49,906
Who was that?

780
00:48:49,974 --> 00:48:51,441
Captain Wainwright.

781
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:53,271
Texas Rangers?

782
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:54,538
Mm-hmm.

783
00:48:56,013 --> 00:48:59,915
He wants me to, uh, hold off
on picking this fella up

784
00:48:59,984 --> 00:49:02,077
until him and his boys get up here.

785
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:04,483
Shit. Wants to get
his picture in the paper.

786
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:05,545
Yeah.

787
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:08,717
We do all the work,
they get all the glory.

788
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:10,316
Yep.

789
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:16,533
l guess that's just the way the world is.

790
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:18,398
lsn't that right, Samuel?

791
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:26,832
l have an announcement
to make. Excuse me.

792
00:49:28,012 --> 00:49:30,480
Recently, l-- uh, we--

793
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,048
Mm-hmm.

794
00:49:32,116 --> 00:49:35,552
...sent some letters
to some major universities.

795
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:37,644
Told them all about us, our team,

796
00:49:37,755 --> 00:49:39,188
what we've been doing,

797
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:43,215
and, uh, yesterday
we got a response.

798
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:46,623
From Oklahoma City University.

799
00:49:46,697 --> 00:49:48,130
Aren't they--?

800
00:49:48,198 --> 00:49:50,063
Anglo-Saxon? Yes. Yes.

801
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:51,965
We'll be the first Negro college in America--

802
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:54,231
well, one of the first Negro
colleges in America--

803
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:55,772
to ever debate a white college.

804
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:56,931
All right!

805
00:49:57,007 --> 00:49:58,634
University of Oklahoma!

806
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:02,076
Not University of Oklahoma.
Oklahoma City University.

807
00:50:02,212 --> 00:50:04,942
The debate will take place
at an off-campus site.

808
00:50:04,982 --> 00:50:06,643
Wait. An off-campus site? Why?

809
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,775
Because sometimes, Mr. Lowe,

810
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:11,150
you have to take things
one step at a time.

811
00:50:11,221 --> 00:50:13,018
So what you're saying is
the crackers in Oklahoma

812
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,489
ain't gonna let us on their campus.

813
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:17,618
No, what l'm saying is you have to take
things one step at a time.

814
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:19,162
This is a great opportunity.

815
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:20,161
Thank you very much.

816
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,722
Master is going to give us
a crumb off his plate, huh?

817
00:50:26,904 --> 00:50:28,769
What? Wha--

818
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:31,535
l think Lowe here is afraid.

819
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:34,076
What am l afraid of, James?

820
00:50:34,144 --> 00:50:36,112
l think you're afraid
to debate white people.

821
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,545
- Anglo-Saxons.
- Anglo-Saxons.

822
00:50:37,648 --> 00:50:38,376
Thank you very much.

823
00:50:38,482 --> 00:50:40,006
Mr. Tolson, let me debate.

824
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:44,747
l mean, l'll debate
Anglo-Saxons anywhere:

825
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:46,652
in a dark alley, with no light,

826
00:50:46,724 --> 00:50:48,988
with a candle lit and people
chasing you down with guns.

827
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:51,357
Hell, l'll debate Anglo-Saxons anywhere.

828
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:52,690
l ain't afraid.

829
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,321
l am.

830
00:50:57,901 --> 00:51:00,131
Mr. Tolson, when l came here today,

831
00:51:00,204 --> 00:51:03,367
l saw the sheriff outside watching your house.

832
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:05,500
What's going on?

833
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:11,838
Maybe you should ask the sheriff.

834
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:14,679
l've been hearing a lot of rumors
about what you're doing.

835
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:16,685
My dad just called the Dean last week

836
00:51:16,754 --> 00:51:18,312
and asked, ''What is
a communist doing

837
00:51:18,422 --> 00:51:19,787
teaching at a good Methodist college?''

838
00:51:19,857 --> 00:51:21,950
My politics are my business,
Mr. Burgess,

839
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:24,755
and l promise you that they
will not endanger the team.

840
00:51:24,828 --> 00:51:26,455
But, sir, it is being endangered.

841
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,862
l came to Wiley College
to be educated, not investigated.

842
00:51:28,932 --> 00:51:30,058
l understand that.

843
00:51:30,134 --> 00:51:32,034
l don't want to be dragged into anything.

844
00:51:32,102 --> 00:51:34,229
- You're not--
- lf my parents find--

845
00:51:34,304 --> 00:51:36,101
l'm sorry.

846
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:39,675
Mr. Tolson, please.

847
00:51:39,743 --> 00:51:41,836
Just tell me you're not
a communist. Otherwise--

848
00:51:41,912 --> 00:51:43,607
Otherwise what?

849
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,508
Otherwise what?

850
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:50,450
My father says l have to quit.

851
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:51,852
Nobody wants that.

852
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:53,253
Then tell me.

853
00:51:54,925 --> 00:52:00,625
As l said, my politics are my business.

854
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:04,197
l guess l have to resign.

855
00:52:14,044 --> 00:52:18,845
Mrs. Tolson, thank you
for a wonderful dinner.

856
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:21,144
You're welcome, Ham.

857
00:52:23,086 --> 00:52:24,678
Good luck in Oklahoma, y'all.

858
00:52:27,658 --> 00:52:29,353
l know you'll win.

859
00:52:44,274 --> 00:52:46,003
All right. Well,

860
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:48,943
if anybody else wants to quit, l'll understand.

861
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:36,051
Resolved:

862
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:39,653
Negroes should be--

863
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:42,324
should be admitted--

864
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:43,866
l can't hear you!

865
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:45,595
Speak up!

866
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:47,762
Resolved--

867
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:56,443
Negroes should be admitted
to state universities.

868
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:59,710
My partner and l will prove

869
00:53:59,816 --> 00:54:04,185
that blocking a Negro's admission
to a state university

870
00:54:04,254 --> 00:54:08,953
is not only wrong, it is absurd.

871
00:54:09,026 --> 00:54:15,693
The Negro people are not just a color
in the American fabric.

872
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:18,735
They are the thread
that holds it all together.

873
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:22,568
Consider the legal
and historical record.

874
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:24,607
May 13, 1865:

875
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:26,302
Sergeant Crocker, a Negro,

876
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:30,142
is the last soldier to die in the Civil War.

877
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:32,374
1918: The first U.S. soldiers

878
00:54:32,482 --> 00:54:34,347
decorated for bravery in France

879
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:37,910
are Negroes Henry Johnson
and Needham Roberts.

880
00:54:38,021 --> 00:54:41,457
1920: <i>The New York Times</i> announces

881
00:54:41,525 --> 00:54:45,655
that the ''N'' in Negro would hereafter
be capitalized.

882
00:54:45,729 --> 00:54:49,756
To force upon the South
what they are not ready for

883
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,165
would result in nothing
but more racial hatred.

884
00:54:52,235 --> 00:54:53,224
What?

885
00:54:53,303 --> 00:54:55,328
Dr. W.E.B. DuBois--

886
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:58,602
he's perhaps the most eminent
Negro scholar in America.

887
00:54:58,675 --> 00:55:00,540
He comments...

888
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:04,670
''lt's a silly waste
of money, time, and temper

889
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:06,342
''to try and compel a powerful majority

890
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:10,375
to do what they are
determined not to do.''

891
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:13,854
My opponent so conveniently chose
to ignore the fact

892
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:17,587
that W.E.B. DuBois is the first Negro

893
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:21,324
to receive a Ph.D
from a white college called Harvard.

894
00:55:21,398 --> 00:55:22,956
Dr. DuBois, he adds,

895
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:27,402
''lt is impossible--
impossible for a Negro

896
00:55:27,471 --> 00:55:30,304
to receive a proper education
at a white college.''

897
00:55:30,374 --> 00:55:33,400
The most eminent
Negro scholar in America

898
00:55:33,477 --> 00:55:35,809
is the product of
an lvy League education.

899
00:55:35,879 --> 00:55:39,144
You see, DuBois knows all too well
the white man's resistance to change.

900
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:43,049
But that's no reason to keep
a black man out of any college.

901
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,317
lf someone didn't force upon the South
something it wasn't ready for,

902
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:47,584
l'd still be in chains,

903
00:55:47,658 --> 00:55:50,092
and Miss Booke here would be
running from her old Master!

904
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:54,556
l do admit it.

905
00:55:54,631 --> 00:55:56,531
lt is true.

906
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,730
Far too many whites are afflicted
with the disease of racial hatred.

907
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:02,998
And because of racism,

908
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:05,633
it would be impossible
for a Negro to be happy

909
00:56:05,676 --> 00:56:07,041
at a southern white college today.

910
00:56:07,077 --> 00:56:08,169
That's true.

911
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:09,610
And if someone is unhappy,

912
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,776
it is impossible to see how they could
receive a proper education.

913
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:15,351
That's right.

914
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:16,977
Yes, a time will come

915
00:56:17,087 --> 00:56:19,954
when Negroes and whites
will walk on the same campus

916
00:56:20,023 --> 00:56:22,685
and we will share
the same classrooms.

917
00:56:24,227 --> 00:56:27,458
But sadly, that day is not today.

918
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:31,023
As long as schools
are segregated,

919
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:36,903
Negroes will receive an education
that is both separate and unequal.

920
00:56:36,973 --> 00:56:38,941
By Oklahoma's own reckoning,

921
00:56:39,009 --> 00:56:42,740
the state is currently
spending five times more

922
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:44,781
for the education of a white child

923
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:47,213
than it is spending
to educate a colored child.

924
00:56:47,317 --> 00:56:50,912
That means better textbooks
for that child than for that child.

925
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:52,579
Oh, l say that's a shame,

926
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:55,783
but my opponent says
today is not the day

927
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:59,659
for whites and coloreds
to go to the same college,

928
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,994
to share the same campus,

929
00:57:02,132 --> 00:57:04,123
to walk in the same classroom.

930
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:07,796
Well, would you kindly tell me
when is that day gonna come?

931
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:10,102
ls it gonna come tomorrow?
ls it gonna come next week?

932
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:11,470
ln a hundred years?

933
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:12,599
Never?

934
00:57:12,676 --> 00:57:14,667
No, the time for justice,

935
00:57:14,745 --> 00:57:17,714
the time for freedom,
and the time for equality

936
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:21,547
is always, is always, right now!

937
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:39,023
Thank you.

938
00:57:51,148 --> 00:57:52,581
What is this?

939
00:57:52,682 --> 00:57:54,149
l told you it was holy wine.

940
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,411
Put hair on your chest.

941
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:56,952
lf you say so.

942
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:57,952
Good, ain't it?

943
00:57:58,021 --> 00:57:59,113
Uh-huh.

944
00:57:59,222 --> 00:58:01,349
You know where the bathroom
is if you need it.

945
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:02,719
Yeah.

946
00:58:08,031 --> 00:58:10,397
And my weapons were words.

947
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:12,799
l didn't need a gun. l didn't need a knife.

948
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:13,858
You see--

949
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:17,465
Meet me outside in five minutes.

950
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:19,600
And then what?

951
00:58:31,388 --> 00:58:32,753
Yes, l did, honey,

952
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:35,189
and nobody knows that
better than you know.

953
00:58:35,258 --> 00:58:36,384
Oh, l'm fine.

954
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:37,892
How are you doing, Pearl?

955
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:38,985
Pearl!

956
00:58:39,062 --> 00:58:40,927
Yes, l do. Where's your husband?

957
00:58:40,997 --> 00:58:42,828
- He's in the study.
- Okay.

958
00:58:56,413 --> 00:58:58,313
Dr. Farmer.

959
00:58:58,415 --> 00:58:59,712
Congratulations, Melvin.

960
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:00,714
Thank you.

961
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:02,182
You've put us on the map.

962
00:59:02,252 --> 00:59:03,879
Well, your son is doing a great job.

963
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,319
His research is impeccable.

964
00:59:05,388 --> 00:59:08,016
That's good to hear.
That's good to hear.

965
00:59:08,091 --> 00:59:10,958
Listen, there are people around town

966
00:59:11,027 --> 00:59:13,928
who aren't very happy
with your off-campus activities.

967
00:59:15,398 --> 00:59:17,161
They're calling you a radical.

968
00:59:17,234 --> 00:59:19,293
ln fact, l wouldn't be a bit surprised

969
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:21,530
to find out one morning
when l woke up

970
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:23,470
that you were strung up to a tree.

971
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,905
They'd have to catch me first.

972
00:59:24,975 --> 00:59:26,499
This is serious, Melvin.

973
00:59:26,576 --> 00:59:28,237
Very serious.

974
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:30,871
A hungry Negro steals
a chicken, he goes to jail.

975
00:59:30,947 --> 00:59:33,780
A rich businessman steals
bonds, he goes to Congress.

976
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:35,078
l think that's wrong.

977
00:59:35,185 --> 00:59:38,382
Now, if that makes me a radical,
a socialist, a communist, so be it.

978
00:59:38,455 --> 00:59:39,513
Amen-- Amen on that.

979
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:41,147
- Jesus was a radical.
- Careful.

980
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:43,123
Yes, He was. Jesus was a radical.

981
00:59:43,193 --> 00:59:44,717
Mental institutions are filled with people

982
00:59:44,794 --> 00:59:46,386
who have confused themselves
with Jesus Christ.

983
00:59:46,463 --> 00:59:47,521
l'm not confused.

984
00:59:47,597 --> 00:59:49,064
You're convinced you're Jesus Christ now?

985
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:50,565
- No.
- You're convinced you're Jesus Christ?

986
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:51,965
You know what words do.

987
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:53,195
- Okay.
- Come on now.

988
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:54,498
Amen.

989
00:59:54,571 --> 00:59:55,868
Don't want to confuse
yourself with Jesus Christ.

990
00:59:55,939 --> 00:59:57,770
l'm not confused. l'm convinced.

991
00:59:57,841 --> 01:00:00,469
l'm not, uh, l'm not judging you.

992
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:06,316
l'm just concerned
about your methods.

993
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:08,284
What methods?

994
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:11,411
James was there that night, wasn't he?

995
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:14,149
He was not with me.

996
01:00:14,224 --> 01:00:15,452
ls he involved in this?

997
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:16,787
Of course not, James.

998
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,624
l've done everything in my power
to keep him out of this.

999
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:20,754
- To keep him out?
- Yes.

1000
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,593
Are you telling me
he wants to be involved?

1001
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,293
Maybe this is something
you should discuss with him.

1002
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:25,766
l'm discussing it with you right now,

1003
01:00:25,835 --> 01:00:27,894
and l don't feel like l'm getting
a straight answer.

1004
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:29,131
You're getting a straight answer.

1005
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:31,673
l think that you were
there with him that night.

1006
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:32,673
He was not with me.

1007
01:00:32,742 --> 01:00:33,834
He's a 1 4-year-old boy.

1008
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:34,899
l understand that.

1009
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:37,538
l'll do whatever l have to do
to protect him.

1010
01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:38,774
ls anybody thirsty?

1011
01:00:38,882 --> 01:00:40,372
Here you are.

1012
01:00:40,483 --> 01:00:42,417
Thank you. Thank you, Ruth.

1013
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:43,884
- You're welcome.
- Mm-hmm.

1014
01:00:43,954 --> 01:00:45,421
Okay.

1015
01:00:45,522 --> 01:00:47,888
Ruth, this is a fine party.

1016
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,357
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1017
01:00:49,426 --> 01:00:51,394
l think it's time
for some sweet potato pie.

1018
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:52,393
Please.

1019
01:00:52,462 --> 01:00:53,793
l'll help you with that.

1020
01:01:00,837 --> 01:01:03,465
Not the time to talk about it.

1021
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,302
Congratulations.

1022
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:05,706
Thank you.

1023
01:01:29,332 --> 01:01:31,994
lt's so beautiful out here.

1024
01:01:32,068 --> 01:01:33,831
Mm-hmm.

1025
01:01:33,903 --> 01:01:35,063
Yeah.

1026
01:01:35,138 --> 01:01:38,869
l was born near here,
a little further up the lake near Jefferson.

1027
01:01:38,942 --> 01:01:42,434
l've been coming here
since l was a little boy.

1028
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:45,037
Your parents still live around here?

1029
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:48,243
No, no. They're, uh, they're gone.

1030
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:50,342
My grandparents raised me.

1031
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:52,421
And my Pah-Pah, he, uh,

1032
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:54,820
spent his life doing
the levees around here--

1033
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:56,153
for free, of course.

1034
01:01:56,226 --> 01:01:58,456
- Mm. He was a slave?
- Mm-hmm.

1035
01:01:58,528 --> 01:02:00,962
My grandma was always
telling me to be good

1036
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:04,533
or else the Confederates would rise up
out of Marshall Cemetery and get me.

1037
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:08,435
Boy.

1038
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:13,869
What?

1039
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:17,208
l've just never seen
this side of you before.

1040
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,373
What side?

1041
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:21,916
You seem so calm,

1042
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:23,418
so peaceful.

1043
01:02:23,486 --> 01:02:26,785
lt's what the lake does to me.

1044
01:02:26,856 --> 01:02:29,324
l'm happy when l'm out here,
you know?

1045
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:32,922
lt's funny.

1046
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:51,408
Part of me wants to just stay out here
by the lake, you know?

1047
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:56,578
Read books all day and hunt
and fish when l get hungry.

1048
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:58,984
And the other part
wants to go everywhere,

1049
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:00,317
you know, see everything.

1050
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:07,192
l want to go to New Orleans and New York
and Chicago and even San Francisco.

1051
01:03:08,164 --> 01:03:10,689
l just want to go...

1052
01:03:10,767 --> 01:03:14,897
walking down the road and...

1053
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:16,336
just disappear.

1054
01:03:19,876 --> 01:03:22,845
Well, maybe you could
take me with you.

1055
01:05:09,419 --> 01:05:10,545
- Lord.
- What?

1056
01:05:10,653 --> 01:05:12,211
lt's the school band,
and they're outside.

1057
01:05:12,322 --> 01:05:13,983
What? Jesus!

1058
01:05:14,057 --> 01:05:15,991
l thought you said nobody
ever comes around here.

1059
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:17,321
Nobody ever does
come here, Samantha.

1060
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:18,792
- Hold on! Hold on!

1061
01:05:18,861 --> 01:05:20,488
Henry, come on!

1062
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:23,029
Henry.

1063
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:24,259
Get dressed.

1064
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:25,892
What's going on?

1065
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:28,164
We're gonna go get
Mr. Tolson and Samantha,

1066
01:05:28,238 --> 01:05:30,900
head back to the campus,
and have a pep rally.

1067
01:05:30,974 --> 01:05:32,305
Come on, get dressed.

1068
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:33,967
You know what?
You go get Tolson,

1069
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:36,136
and l'll meet up with y'all later on campus.

1070
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:37,406
Come on, Lowe.

1071
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,744
You know it's going to be fun.

1072
01:05:51,427 --> 01:05:53,861
l guess l'll tell them
you're going to join us later?

1073
01:06:06,876 --> 01:06:08,605
He's going to join us later.

1074
01:06:08,678 --> 01:06:11,408
He just has to clean
his house, that's all.

1075
01:06:29,766 --> 01:06:33,600
Great news. Great news.
Great news!

1076
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:36,537
My phone has been ringing off the hook.

1077
01:06:36,606 --> 01:06:38,801
University of Michigan
wants to debate us.

1078
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,900
So does SMU. So does Georgia.

1079
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:42,069
Where's Mr. Lowe?

1080
01:06:42,145 --> 01:06:44,113
When do l get to debate?

1081
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:45,545
Sooner than you think, James.

1082
01:06:45,648 --> 01:06:46,706
Sooner than you think.

1083
01:06:46,816 --> 01:06:47,942
When?

1084
01:06:48,051 --> 01:06:49,382
When you're ready.

1085
01:06:49,452 --> 01:06:50,612
l'm ready now.

1086
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,883
Mr. Tolson, l do not mind if James--

1087
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:56,984
What's wrong?

1088
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:59,494
Maybe l'm tired of this.

1089
01:06:59,562 --> 01:07:00,893
Of what?

1090
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:02,964
Of watching other people debate.

1091
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:05,227
When am l going to get
a chance to prove myself?

1092
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:07,236
You're our best researcher, James.

1093
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,862
We could not do this without you.

1094
01:07:08,938 --> 01:07:11,236
You do plenty without me.

1095
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,410
Excuse me.

1096
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:21,843
- James!
- What?

1097
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:24,784
James, you wait!

1098
01:07:24,854 --> 01:07:27,687
That was so mean
what you said in there.

1099
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:31,518
All right, uh, look,

1100
01:07:31,594 --> 01:07:33,289
l don't want to lose your friendship.

1101
01:07:33,363 --> 01:07:36,423
How can you lose something
that you never had?

1102
01:07:36,499 --> 01:07:38,524
You were never my friend?

1103
01:07:38,601 --> 01:07:41,001
Maybe l don't want
to just be your friend.

1104
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:43,538
Maybe it hurts me
to be your friend.

1105
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:56,349
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

1106
01:07:59,489 --> 01:08:00,888
Grab his hands.

1107
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:06,821
Mr. Tolson!

1108
01:08:11,834 --> 01:08:12,858
Where is he?

1109
01:08:12,935 --> 01:08:14,095
Calm down, Henry.

1110
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:15,102
Have you seen him?

1111
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:16,331
No, they won't let us.

1112
01:08:16,406 --> 01:08:17,771
They didn't do nothing to you, did they?

1113
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,831
- No, we're fine.
- Deputy,

1114
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:21,467
l'm Dr. James Farmer
of Wiley College.

1115
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:23,444
This is William Taylor,
Mr. Tolson's attorney.

1116
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:24,980
And this is his wife Ruth.

1117
01:08:25,047 --> 01:08:26,071
Hello.

1118
01:08:26,182 --> 01:08:27,706
l'd like to see my client, please.

1119
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:28,784
William!

1120
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:30,341
Sheriff Dozier. Dr. James Farmer--

1121
01:08:30,453 --> 01:08:32,250
Hello, William. How you doing today?

1122
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:33,879
Fine, sir, thank you. And you?

1123
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:35,582
Oh, not too bad, not too bad.

1124
01:08:35,658 --> 01:08:37,182
Me and William, we go way back.

1125
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,251
l knew William when l was a boy.

1126
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:42,195
Could l see my client now, Sheriff?

1127
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:43,459
Your client?

1128
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:45,933
Well, the fact of the business
is, William,

1129
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:47,902
your client is kind of busy right now.

1130
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,232
Busy doing what?

1131
01:08:49,305 --> 01:08:51,933
Sheriff. Sheriff.

1132
01:08:52,942 --> 01:08:54,068
We have a situation.

1133
01:08:55,278 --> 01:08:56,711
Get some of your boys out there.

1134
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:57,803
All right, men.

1135
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,849
Let him go! Let him go!

1136
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:03,315
Let him go! Let him go!

1137
01:09:03,386 --> 01:09:06,014
Let him go! Let him go!

1138
01:09:06,055 --> 01:09:08,683
Let him go! Let him go!

1139
01:09:08,758 --> 01:09:10,419
Let him go! Let him go!

1140
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:12,757
Let him go! Let him go!

1141
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:14,660
Let him go! Let him go!

1142
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:16,357
Let him go! Let him go!

1143
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:17,729
They with you?

1144
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,290
That's right.

1145
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:23,395
See? This is what happens to a town
when you let the unions in.

1146
01:09:23,473 --> 01:09:24,701
Starts trouble.

1147
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:27,038
People get all riled up about nothing.

1148
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:30,943
One of them's liable to get hurt,
if you catch my drift.

1149
01:09:31,013 --> 01:09:32,981
Sheriff, since it's clear

1150
01:09:33,082 --> 01:09:36,245
that you have no evidence
to arrest Mr. Tolson,

1151
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:38,252
l suggest you let him go.

1152
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:39,583
You suggest it?

1153
01:09:39,655 --> 01:09:40,952
Who the hell are you?

1154
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,958
Couple of months ago,

1155
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:47,154
there was a raid
on Floyd Tillman's barn.

1156
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:50,927
lt was a peaceful and lawful
gathering of sharecroppers

1157
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,903
who were brutally attacked
by a gang of violent vigilantes.

1158
01:09:55,972 --> 01:09:59,806
Now, witnesses say
that you were there.

1159
01:09:59,876 --> 01:10:03,437
lf you led that raid, Sheriff,

1160
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:06,742
you're the one who broke
the law, not Tolson.

1161
01:10:08,117 --> 01:10:10,210
Are you threatening me, boy?

1162
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:11,650
No, sir.

1163
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:13,689
l wouldn't do that.

1164
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:16,815
But l cannot speak
for those people outside.

1165
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:21,887
An unjust law is no law at all.

1166
01:10:21,964 --> 01:10:24,159
What does that mean?

1167
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:26,258
A mass slaughter

1168
01:10:26,335 --> 01:10:29,930
of citizens, both white and colored,

1169
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:31,735
by Texas Rangers?

1170
01:10:31,807 --> 01:10:35,470
ls that really what you want
as the Sheriff of this county?

1171
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:40,914
Now, if you let Tolson go home,

1172
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:42,848
l believe--

1173
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:48,323
l believe that these folks outside,
they'll go home as well.

1174
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:16,680
That pig wasn't worth $25.

1175
01:11:16,786 --> 01:11:17,753
What?

1176
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,981
You owe my father some money.

1177
01:12:19,281 --> 01:12:20,748
Have a seat, Mr. Farmer.

1178
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:24,342
Oh, Lord.

1179
01:12:25,655 --> 01:12:26,849
Um...

1180
01:12:29,425 --> 01:12:31,893
SMU has cancelled.

1181
01:12:31,961 --> 01:12:35,829
University of Georgia sounds
like they will follow suit.

1182
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:37,297
Why?

1183
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:41,497
l've been blacklisted.

1184
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:43,561
They're talking about censuring me.

1185
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:45,971
Dean Clay and the board
have asked me

1186
01:12:46,042 --> 01:12:49,500
to stop working with
the sharecroppers, or else.

1187
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:52,138
They say that it is not my fight.

1188
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:55,706
So...things are bad.

1189
01:12:55,818 --> 01:12:57,786
My academic career's in jeopardy.

1190
01:12:57,887 --> 01:13:00,253
My debate team has nowhere to go.

1191
01:13:02,358 --> 01:13:04,588
Anyone know who Antaeus was?

1192
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:09,154
Sure. He was a gigantic
wrestler in Greek mythology.

1193
01:13:09,231 --> 01:13:13,565
His mother was, uh, Gaea,
the goddess of Earth,

1194
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:15,570
and, uh, l mean, he was unbeatable

1195
01:13:15,638 --> 01:13:17,538
because anytime someone
threw him down to the Earth,

1196
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:18,595
it would make him stronger.

1197
01:13:18,674 --> 01:13:19,868
That's correct.

1198
01:13:19,942 --> 01:13:21,341
lt would make him stronger.

1199
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:25,141
Defeat would make him stronger.

1200
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:27,307
You are my students.
l am your teacher.

1201
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:30,112
l think that's a sacred trust.

1202
01:13:30,219 --> 01:13:32,244
So what do l say to you now?

1203
01:13:32,354 --> 01:13:34,345
Quit because the Dean says so?

1204
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:36,357
Because the sheriff says so?

1205
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:38,450
Because the Texas Rangers say so?

1206
01:13:38,527 --> 01:13:39,824
No.

1207
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:41,863
l am diametrically opposed to that.

1208
01:13:41,931 --> 01:13:44,297
My message to you is to never quit.

1209
01:13:44,366 --> 01:13:46,027
We are not quitting.

1210
01:13:46,102 --> 01:13:47,126
Good.

1211
01:13:47,203 --> 01:13:48,727
What do you want us to do?

1212
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:49,793
Debate Harvard.

1213
01:13:49,872 --> 01:13:51,339
- Harvard?
- Harvard University.

1214
01:13:51,407 --> 01:13:53,671
They're the reigning
national champions.

1215
01:13:53,743 --> 01:13:56,644
lf we defeat them, we defeat the best.

1216
01:13:56,712 --> 01:13:58,646
Mr. Tolson, sir, with all due respect,

1217
01:13:58,748 --> 01:14:00,477
um, Harvard ain't going to debate us,

1218
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:02,116
not little old Wiley College
in Marshall, Texas.

1219
01:14:02,184 --> 01:14:03,617
They know who we are, Henry.

1220
01:14:03,686 --> 01:14:05,847
l've been writing them letters,
sending them articles.

1221
01:14:05,888 --> 01:14:07,753
But how do we get a letter back?

1222
01:14:07,823 --> 01:14:08,790
By continuing to win.

1223
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:09,984
Dr. Farmer has informed me

1224
01:14:10,059 --> 01:14:13,222
that Howard University is going to be
at Prairie View next week.

1225
01:14:13,295 --> 01:14:14,819
We annihilated Fisk.

1226
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:17,525
lf we eliminate Howard,
we will have beaten

1227
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,534
the two best Negro colleges in America,

1228
01:14:19,602 --> 01:14:21,934
and l can guarantee you
that l will see to it

1229
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:23,528
that Harvard does not ignore that.

1230
01:14:23,606 --> 01:14:24,971
All right?

1231
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,029
Yeah.

1232
01:14:35,251 --> 01:14:36,684
Just look for it on there.

1233
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:37,810
You see it on there?

1234
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,182
l've been looking the whole time.

1235
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:40,552
Prairie View, Texas. The 127.

1236
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:42,750
You show me where to look
because it's not on--

1237
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:44,258
127 near Waxahachie.

1238
01:14:44,326 --> 01:14:45,554
lt's not there.

1239
01:14:45,628 --> 01:14:47,653
lt's there. You just can't find it.

1240
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,493
l see 2, and l see 7.

1241
01:14:49,565 --> 01:14:52,329
Right. Now look for a 1 in front of it,
and you got it.

1242
01:14:53,903 --> 01:14:54,835
- After 126--
- Okay.

1243
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:57,498
Before 128.

1244
01:14:57,573 --> 01:14:59,404
l really don't think--

1245
01:14:59,475 --> 01:15:00,407
You don't see it.

1246
01:15:00,543 --> 01:15:01,908
When did you get this map?

1247
01:15:43,886 --> 01:15:44,875
What are you doing?

1248
01:15:44,987 --> 01:15:46,545
l'm gonna cut him down.

1249
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,451
Get back in the car. Shut the door.

1250
01:15:51,894 --> 01:15:53,486
Nobody move.

1251
01:15:55,197 --> 01:15:56,221
Just get down.

1252
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:58,596
Get down, get down.

1253
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:04,231
Get down, too. You get down, too.

1254
01:16:19,388 --> 01:16:21,185
There's niggers in that car!

1255
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:22,451
Come on, come on!

1256
01:16:36,005 --> 01:16:37,063
Get out of the car!

1257
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:38,333
Get out of that car!

1258
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:39,738
Stop that car right now!

1259
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:12,564
All right. Everybody sit tight,

1260
01:17:12,641 --> 01:17:15,735
and, uh...

1261
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:17,278
l'll get the keys.

1262
01:17:27,222 --> 01:17:28,712
How you doing, Miss Becker?

1263
01:17:28,824 --> 01:17:29,950
l'm fine. You all right?

1264
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:30,957
Yes, ma'am.

1265
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:32,152
l got your rooms all ready.

1266
01:17:32,227 --> 01:17:33,319
- Thank you.

1267
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,865
Henry.

1268
01:17:44,506 --> 01:17:45,996
Henry!

1269
01:17:47,276 --> 01:17:48,641
Henry!

1270
01:18:08,597 --> 01:18:10,189
They ain't going to wake up.

1271
01:18:12,935 --> 01:18:13,959
Come on.

1272
01:18:14,036 --> 01:18:14,968
Ha!

1273
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:37,584
See you.

1274
01:18:38,627 --> 01:18:40,754
All right. Be good, all right?

1275
01:18:49,905 --> 01:18:51,338
Hey, baby. How you doing?

1276
01:18:53,242 --> 01:18:56,268
Why are you still up?
You waiting on me?

1277
01:19:00,015 --> 01:19:02,415
What's the matter, baby?
Come on!

1278
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:03,745
Hey!

1279
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,112
Samantha!

1280
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:09,689
Shut up. Let's go.

1281
01:19:09,758 --> 01:19:10,690
Hey, preacher boy.

1282
01:19:10,759 --> 01:19:12,420
Shut up. Let's go.

1283
01:19:12,494 --> 01:19:13,426
Come on.

1284
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:14,427
Where are we going?

1285
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:15,724
Back to our room.

1286
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:20,859
Got him, Mr. Tolson.

1287
01:19:31,413 --> 01:19:32,437
Shh!

1288
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:35,509
- Shh!

1289
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:37,751
- Shh!

1290
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:40,288
Okay. Just sit-- sit--

1291
01:19:40,389 --> 01:19:42,983
Not in that bed, though. Get up.

1292
01:19:44,693 --> 01:19:45,921
Come here.

1293
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:47,655
Give me a hug.

1294
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:50,363
Stop!

1295
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:01,904
You're worthless.

1296
01:20:01,977 --> 01:20:03,604
What?

1297
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,409
You think you're the only one hurting?

1298
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:10,518
Um...

1299
01:20:11,753 --> 01:20:15,712
Okay, l'm sorry...for everything.

1300
01:20:15,824 --> 01:20:20,557
For, uh, for drinkin', yeah,

1301
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:22,824
l apologize.

1302
01:20:22,898 --> 01:20:25,366
l'm not talking about me.

1303
01:20:41,483 --> 01:20:43,383
You're right.

1304
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:45,579
l'm gonna go talk to her.

1305
01:20:46,755 --> 01:20:48,279
No, no, you won't, Lowe.

1306
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,324
She doesn't need
to see you like this, okay?

1307
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:51,825
l'm just going to talk to her.

1308
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:53,156
Leave me alone.

1309
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:54,217
Lowe!

1310
01:21:00,536 --> 01:21:02,003
Calm down, boy!

1311
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:03,594
Stop! Stop!

1312
01:21:03,672 --> 01:21:04,730
l'm not playing with you.

1313
01:21:04,806 --> 01:21:07,366
Calm-- Calm down!

1314
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:09,036
You crazy?

1315
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:15,173
You're never gonna forget what you saw
out there, do you understand?

1316
01:21:15,284 --> 01:21:16,979
You're never gonna forget
what you saw out there.

1317
01:21:17,085 --> 01:21:19,019
Hanging's the easiest
part of it sometimes.

1318
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:20,816
Sometimes they cut
the little fingers off,

1319
01:21:20,889 --> 01:21:22,379
your toes, your nose, your ears.

1320
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:24,322
Sometimes they cut
your privates off.

1321
01:21:24,393 --> 01:21:26,759
Sometimes they skin you alive.

1322
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:32,597
You'll never be able to forget.

1323
01:21:47,549 --> 01:21:48,743
What do you think he did?

1324
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:50,943
He didn't have to do nothing, James!

1325
01:21:51,053 --> 01:21:52,384
He didn't have to do nothing!

1326
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:54,922
ln Texas they lynch Negroes!

1327
01:21:55,023 --> 01:21:57,253
Do you understand?

1328
01:21:57,326 --> 01:21:59,658
So it doesn't matter
how good we are, does it?

1329
01:21:59,728 --> 01:22:01,593
What are you talk-- What?

1330
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:03,721
This is all useless.

1331
01:22:03,799 --> 01:22:05,733
What are you talking about?

1332
01:22:05,767 --> 01:22:08,497
l mean we're just a bunch of Negroes

1333
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:10,562
debating each other
on subjects we all agree on.

1334
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,540
Now, James, don't talk like that, all right?

1335
01:22:13,609 --> 01:22:15,406
- Why not?
- Because you can't!

1336
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:18,737
Not you.

1337
01:23:03,191 --> 01:23:05,785
Bye! God bless you!

1338
01:23:09,531 --> 01:23:10,862
Where's Samantha?

1339
01:23:10,932 --> 01:23:12,422
She's not going with us.

1340
01:23:12,501 --> 01:23:13,468
Why not?

1341
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:16,003
Why do you think?

1342
01:23:16,071 --> 01:23:18,130
l took her to the bus station.

1343
01:23:18,206 --> 01:23:20,071
She wanted to go back to school.

1344
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:23,744
You wanted your chance.

1345
01:23:25,213 --> 01:23:26,646
This is it.

1346
01:23:31,687 --> 01:23:34,087
But how can any Negro

1347
01:23:34,156 --> 01:23:36,886
defend the punishment of prison

1348
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:40,758
when he's seen so much oppression
in his own life?

1349
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:42,262
Yeah!

1350
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:44,026
How?

1351
01:23:44,099 --> 01:23:48,536
Because crime itself
is a form of oppression,

1352
01:23:48,603 --> 01:23:52,437
and Negroes fall victim
to more violent crime

1353
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:55,533
than any other race in America.

1354
01:23:58,347 --> 01:23:59,814
For us,

1355
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:04,284
prison not only offers protection,
but retribution.

1356
01:24:04,453 --> 01:24:05,477
Yes, indeed!

1357
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:10,457
And for the criminal, it is a dark gift:

1358
01:24:10,525 --> 01:24:14,655
the hardship that introduces
a man to himself,

1359
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:17,995
that rouses his passion
for freedom--

1360
01:24:18,066 --> 01:24:19,055
Yes, sir!

1361
01:24:19,134 --> 01:24:20,692
...his hope for redemption!

1362
01:24:20,769 --> 01:24:21,701
Oh, yeah!

1363
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:31,711
Our next debater from Wiley College,

1364
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,305
Mr. James Farmer, Junior.

1365
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:36,384
Mr. Farmer?

1366
01:25:39,815 --> 01:25:40,975
Mom?

1367
01:25:46,888 --> 01:25:47,855
Mom!

1368
01:26:19,988 --> 01:26:21,319
Honey.

1369
01:26:21,389 --> 01:26:22,481
Hey.

1370
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:23,751
Hi.

1371
01:26:23,825 --> 01:26:25,190
Oh!

1372
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,750
Mmm!

1373
01:26:26,828 --> 01:26:28,762
So?

1374
01:26:30,732 --> 01:26:31,756
We lost.

1375
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:34,529
Oh. l'm sorry.

1376
01:26:34,603 --> 01:26:37,834
Uh, this came.

1377
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:40,867
Harvard.

1378
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:43,207
Wonder what it says.

1379
01:26:43,278 --> 01:26:45,143
Go on and open it and read it.

1380
01:26:45,213 --> 01:26:47,340
- Looks like somebody opened it already.
- Not me.

1381
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:50,074
You didn't open it already?

1382
01:26:50,185 --> 01:26:52,016
No.

1383
01:26:52,087 --> 01:26:54,351
You are not a good liar.

1384
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,550
Out loud.

1385
01:27:03,865 --> 01:27:05,264
''Dear Mr. Tolson,

1386
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:06,664
''thank you for informing us

1387
01:27:06,701 --> 01:27:09,727
''about your historic victory
over Oklahoma City.

1388
01:27:09,771 --> 01:27:12,205
''l'm sure you realize
our season is nearly over,

1389
01:27:12,274 --> 01:27:14,469
''but today we received another letter
from Wiley College

1390
01:27:14,543 --> 01:27:15,703
written by Mr. Henry Lowe''?

1391
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:16,801
Mm-hmm.

1392
01:27:16,878 --> 01:27:18,004
With an ''e''?

1393
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:19,842
''He told us from a student's perspective

1394
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:23,179
about your''-- ahem--
''about your undefeated season.''

1395
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:24,650
Well, we're not undefeated anymore.

1396
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:25,947
Don't matter.

1397
01:27:26,054 --> 01:27:28,522
''We wish to extend an invitation to--''

1398
01:27:39,868 --> 01:27:41,631
''We wish to extend an invitation

1399
01:27:41,703 --> 01:27:46,470
''to debate Harvard Crimson
here in Cambridge.

1400
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:50,136
Let us know if this is agreeable to you.''

1401
01:27:59,254 --> 01:28:00,186
Honey--

1402
01:28:00,255 --> 01:28:01,153
Don't you tell anybody.

1403
01:28:01,289 --> 01:28:02,381
No.

1404
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,160
No, you don't have to thank me.

1405
01:28:15,236 --> 01:28:17,363
l just wanted to show you
l could write, too.

1406
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:19,100
That's good. Thank you.

1407
01:28:20,976 --> 01:28:22,500
But you could do me a favor.

1408
01:28:22,577 --> 01:28:23,737
What's that?

1409
01:28:27,616 --> 01:28:29,379
Keep Samantha on the team.

1410
01:28:32,554 --> 01:28:33,885
Why would l do that?

1411
01:28:33,955 --> 01:28:37,049
Mr. Tolson, it was a rough night.

1412
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:40,492
Yes, it was, Mr. Lowe, for all of us.

1413
01:28:40,562 --> 01:28:42,689
And she walked out on us
at the last minute.

1414
01:28:42,764 --> 01:28:46,063
No, sir. She did not walk out on us.

1415
01:28:47,235 --> 01:28:48,429
She walked out on me.

1416
01:28:57,045 --> 01:28:59,240
lt's good tea.

1417
01:28:59,347 --> 01:29:02,180
Resolved:
Capitalism is immoral.

1418
01:29:02,317 --> 01:29:05,286
We will be arguing the affirmative.

1419
01:29:05,353 --> 01:29:07,253
To a bunch of Wall Street bankers.

1420
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:12,392
Mr. Tolson, l owe you
and my teammates--

1421
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:15,554
You're late. Come in. Sit down.

1422
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,632
Samantha, l am not--

1423
01:29:36,651 --> 01:29:37,948
Resolved.

1424
01:29:47,762 --> 01:29:50,822
Okay, you got macaroni
and cheese, fried chicken,

1425
01:29:50,899 --> 01:29:52,332
black-eyed peas for good luck,

1426
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,062
red beans and rice,
corn bread, candied yams.

1427
01:29:55,136 --> 01:29:56,967
l put some peach cobbler in there, too,

1428
01:29:57,038 --> 01:29:58,130
and some bread pudding.

1429
01:29:58,206 --> 01:30:01,403
l know you don't like bread pudding,
but l put it in there anyway.

1430
01:30:01,543 --> 01:30:02,703
Thank you, Mom.

1431
01:30:02,777 --> 01:30:03,709
Okay.

1432
01:30:03,778 --> 01:30:05,109
Good luck, son.

1433
01:30:07,082 --> 01:30:08,515
Dad?

1434
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:10,380
Yes, Jim.

1435
01:30:13,488 --> 01:30:16,082
You give Boston my regards.

1436
01:30:16,157 --> 01:30:17,249
You hear?

1437
01:30:17,325 --> 01:30:18,883
Yes, sir.

1438
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,120
James!

1439
01:30:20,195 --> 01:30:21,787
Come on! Train's leaving.

1440
01:30:21,863 --> 01:30:23,455
Coming!

1441
01:30:30,805 --> 01:30:32,136
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye-bye.

1442
01:30:32,207 --> 01:30:33,196
l love you.

1443
01:30:33,274 --> 01:30:34,298
Bye, sis.

1444
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:37,138
Love you!

1445
01:30:37,212 --> 01:30:38,270
Love you, too.

1446
01:30:42,117 --> 01:30:45,780
All aboard leaving for Texarkana, Little Rock,

1447
01:30:45,887 --> 01:30:49,653
St. Louis, and all points north!

1448
01:30:49,724 --> 01:30:51,817
All aboard!

1449
01:30:51,893 --> 01:30:53,485
l'm not going with you.

1450
01:30:53,561 --> 01:30:55,188
What?

1451
01:30:55,263 --> 01:30:56,594
l cannot leave this state.

1452
01:30:56,664 --> 01:30:58,256
lt's a condition of my bail.

1453
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,630
You can't let them stop you.

1454
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:01,362
They're not stopping me.

1455
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:05,098
l just don't want to
jeopardize your opportunity.

1456
01:31:05,173 --> 01:31:06,504
You can win without me.

1457
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:08,372
This is what you wanted
to do all along, isn't it?

1458
01:31:08,409 --> 01:31:09,842
He's right.

1459
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:11,970
Why didn't you tell us this before?

1460
01:31:12,046 --> 01:31:13,673
Because l didn't want
to hear your arguments.

1461
01:31:13,782 --> 01:31:15,682
l knew they'd be too good.

1462
01:31:21,956 --> 01:31:24,322
All right, Mr. Lowe, you're in charge.

1463
01:31:24,392 --> 01:31:27,850
Whatever your instincts
tell you, you listen.

1464
01:31:27,929 --> 01:31:28,861
Yes, sir.

1465
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:29,919
Let's go.

1466
01:31:31,432 --> 01:31:32,524
Let's go.

1467
01:31:34,335 --> 01:31:36,030
What are we supposed
to do without you?

1468
01:31:36,104 --> 01:31:38,265
Win.

1469
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:08,185
Chicago Express, with service to Hartford,

1470
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:10,493
New York, and Philadelphia,

1471
01:33:10,531 --> 01:33:13,500
now boarding, Track 29.

1472
01:33:19,207 --> 01:33:20,936
l thought somebody was
supposed to meet us.

1473
01:33:27,415 --> 01:33:28,609
Wiley College?

1474
01:33:28,716 --> 01:33:29,648
- Yes.
- Yes.

1475
01:33:29,717 --> 01:33:30,741
l'm Harland Osbourne.

1476
01:33:30,852 --> 01:33:33,320
Harvard has put me in charge of you
for the time that you'll be here in Boston.

1477
01:33:33,388 --> 01:33:35,652
- How you doing? l'm Henry Lowe.
- Mr. Lowe.

1478
01:33:35,723 --> 01:33:37,054
- James Farmer, Jr.
- Mr. Farmer.

1479
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:38,649
- Samantha Booke.
- Of course. Miss Booke.

1480
01:33:38,726 --> 01:33:41,456
We should be going.
My car's out front.

1481
01:33:41,529 --> 01:33:42,461
l've got it.

1482
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:43,462
Oh, thank you.

1483
01:33:43,531 --> 01:33:44,725
Just so you know,

1484
01:33:44,799 --> 01:33:46,494
you'll be staying on campus
in Douglas Hall.

1485
01:33:46,567 --> 01:33:47,761
l've got to tell you,

1486
01:33:47,835 --> 01:33:49,530
this debate is stirring up
a lot of excitement.

1487
01:33:49,604 --> 01:33:50,764
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1488
01:33:50,838 --> 01:33:53,306
lt's gonna be broadcast
all over America.

1489
01:33:53,374 --> 01:33:56,002
Can we see where we're
going to debate?

1490
01:33:56,077 --> 01:33:57,101
Of course.

1491
01:34:24,906 --> 01:34:27,932
Hello, Harvard!

1492
01:34:43,257 --> 01:34:44,349
Excuse me.

1493
01:34:44,425 --> 01:34:46,552
You supposed to be here?

1494
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:51,963
l guess we'll find out, won't we?

1495
01:35:07,682 --> 01:35:08,808
Ah!

1496
01:35:12,687 --> 01:35:13,745
Well, look.

1497
01:35:13,855 --> 01:35:15,049
''Mr. Farmer.''

1498
01:35:19,994 --> 01:35:22,258
$5.00?

1499
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:23,490
Lowe, l got $5.00.

1500
01:35:23,564 --> 01:35:25,862
Yeah, l did, too. lt's called per diem.

1501
01:35:25,933 --> 01:35:27,400
Hoo-hoo!

1502
01:35:27,468 --> 01:35:29,299
You want me to hold it for you?

1503
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:31,304
No, not my $5.00.

1504
01:35:37,979 --> 01:35:41,642
l got $5.00. l got $5.00.

1505
01:35:41,749 --> 01:35:42,716
Me, too.

1506
01:35:42,817 --> 01:35:44,910
Well, mine is crispy.

1507
01:35:46,621 --> 01:35:51,183
James, this is high tea, all right?

1508
01:35:51,259 --> 01:35:55,195
We nibble. We do not devour.

1509
01:35:55,263 --> 01:35:57,128
- How do you know?

1510
01:35:57,198 --> 01:35:58,825
l don't.

1511
01:36:00,601 --> 01:36:02,865
Hello. l'm Wilson.

1512
01:36:02,937 --> 01:36:05,269
This is for you.

1513
01:36:05,339 --> 01:36:06,772
Thank you.

1514
01:36:09,377 --> 01:36:12,210
l can't accept that, sir.

1515
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,180
lt would be inappropriate.

1516
01:36:19,787 --> 01:36:21,414
lt would be inappropriate.

1517
01:36:24,192 --> 01:36:25,159
Who's it from?

1518
01:36:25,226 --> 01:36:26,352
lt's from Harvard.

1519
01:36:26,427 --> 01:36:27,758
Maybe it's more money.

1520
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:28,887
Hmm.

1521
01:36:28,963 --> 01:36:31,488
''We have been informed
by Tau Kappa Gamma

1522
01:36:31,566 --> 01:36:33,329
''that your team delivers--

1523
01:36:34,602 --> 01:36:36,763
''canned speeches:

1524
01:36:36,838 --> 01:36:40,831
''arguments written by faculty
rather than students.

1525
01:36:40,908 --> 01:36:42,603
''Therefore, we are
changing the topic.

1526
01:36:42,677 --> 01:36:44,542
''You will have
the same amount of time

1527
01:36:44,612 --> 01:36:46,705
''to write new arguments
as the Harvard team:

1528
01:36:46,814 --> 01:36:48,372
48 hours.''

1529
01:36:49,817 --> 01:36:52,149
Coaches help students all the time.

1530
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,312
Yes, sir.

1531
01:36:53,421 --> 01:36:55,616
''Both teams will be delivered

1532
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:56,782
the same reference books.''

1533
01:36:56,858 --> 01:36:57,825
Yes, sir.

1534
01:36:57,892 --> 01:36:59,018
''Our new topic:
Resolved:

1535
01:36:59,093 --> 01:37:01,823
''Civil disobedience is a moral weapon
in the fight for justice.''

1536
01:37:01,963 --> 01:37:04,557
Wiley College will be
arguing the affirmative.''

1537
01:37:04,632 --> 01:37:05,792
Thank you, sir.

1538
01:37:09,237 --> 01:37:11,933
l can't reach Mr. Tolson.
Nobody knows where he is.

1539
01:37:12,006 --> 01:37:14,531
They're setting us up to lose.

1540
01:37:14,609 --> 01:37:16,440
We can't win without him.

1541
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:19,173
You're wrong.
We can't win without <i>him</i>.

1542
01:37:23,317 --> 01:37:24,807
Thoreau?

1543
01:37:24,919 --> 01:37:27,217
''...less desponding free spirits,

1544
01:37:27,288 --> 01:37:28,516
is in her prisons--''

1545
01:37:28,589 --> 01:37:31,659
''Under a government
which imprisons any unjustly,

1546
01:37:31,659 --> 01:37:33,092
the true place for a just man--''

1547
01:37:33,161 --> 01:37:34,651
Here's your coffee, sir.

1548
01:37:34,729 --> 01:37:36,356
Thank you, Mr. Wilson.

1549
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:37,829
Just Wilson.

1550
01:37:37,899 --> 01:37:39,025
Thank you, Wilson.

1551
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:40,192
''...has provided for her freer

1552
01:37:40,268 --> 01:37:41,292
''and less desponding spirits--''

1553
01:37:42,837 --> 01:37:44,771
But you have to use
the Massacre at Amritsar.

1554
01:37:44,839 --> 01:37:46,306
Agreed, James,

1555
01:37:46,374 --> 01:37:48,137
but we'll save it for the rebuttal.

1556
01:37:48,209 --> 01:37:50,109
We're going to save the best for last

1557
01:37:50,178 --> 01:37:52,078
because you have
to leave the audience--

1558
01:37:52,146 --> 01:37:55,547
l think we should get into Gandhi's
concept of Satyagraha.

1559
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:56,947
l don't agree.

1560
01:37:57,051 --> 01:37:58,575
l don't think people
are gonna understand what--

1561
01:37:58,686 --> 01:38:00,347
what-- Sadagara?

1562
01:38:00,488 --> 01:38:02,353
Sactchmaget? Sactchma--

1563
01:38:02,423 --> 01:38:03,390
Satyagraha.

1564
01:38:03,457 --> 01:38:04,924
From the Sanskrit.

1565
01:38:05,026 --> 01:38:08,393
Meaning truth and fairness.

1566
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:17,503
l told you.

1567
01:38:17,572 --> 01:38:18,698
lt's-- lt's obvious to me

1568
01:38:18,773 --> 01:38:20,434
that we should begin
the debate with Gandhi.

1569
01:38:20,508 --> 01:38:21,975
That's exactly why l won't do it.

1570
01:38:22,043 --> 01:38:23,476
Why should l do the obvious thing?

1571
01:38:23,544 --> 01:38:24,670
Because that's what wins debates!

1572
01:38:24,745 --> 01:38:26,610
Listen to what you're saying.
This is Harvard, okay?

1573
01:38:26,681 --> 01:38:28,911
The first thing you think
when you think civil disobedience is what?

1574
01:38:29,016 --> 01:38:30,278
That's why we should use Gandhi!

1575
01:38:30,384 --> 01:38:31,612
But Gandhi is a strong point!

1576
01:38:31,719 --> 01:38:33,619
l want to win! Do you want to win?

1577
01:38:33,688 --> 01:38:35,747
Yes, l want to win, but he's right!

1578
01:38:35,856 --> 01:38:37,016
This is not getting us anywhere!

1579
01:38:37,091 --> 01:38:38,388
Tolson told me l was in charge!

1580
01:38:38,459 --> 01:38:39,721
He didn't put you in charge!

1581
01:38:39,794 --> 01:38:41,557
You're ''in charge'' does not mean--

1582
01:38:41,629 --> 01:38:42,755
So l can make decisions.

1583
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:44,127
We're not starting with Gandhi!

1584
01:38:44,198 --> 01:38:45,324
Yes, we are!

1585
01:38:45,399 --> 01:38:47,333
Do you hear yourself?
You sound like a kid!

1586
01:38:47,401 --> 01:38:49,028
Well, you are a kid!

1587
01:38:49,103 --> 01:38:50,570
Fellas, come on!

1588
01:38:50,638 --> 01:38:52,265
- l'm an idiot?
- Yes!

1589
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:53,807
To hell with you!
To hell with you!

1590
01:38:53,874 --> 01:38:55,000
To hell with this debate!

1591
01:38:55,076 --> 01:38:56,941
To hell with me?
To hell with me?

1592
01:38:57,011 --> 01:38:58,672
Just because l disagree with you?

1593
01:38:58,746 --> 01:38:59,906
lf you're gonna walk out, fine!

1594
01:38:59,981 --> 01:39:02,142
We're not chasing you!

1595
01:39:02,316 --> 01:39:06,616
We are so tired of chasing you!

1596
01:39:12,193 --> 01:39:13,387
He's coming back, isn't he?

1597
01:39:13,461 --> 01:39:15,053
See if l care!

1598
01:40:20,194 --> 01:40:21,559
How you doing, man?

1599
01:41:21,856 --> 01:41:23,721
You're beautiful when you're asleep.

1600
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:37,637
Henry, l--

1601
01:41:37,705 --> 01:41:39,935
Yeah, l know, l know.

1602
01:41:40,007 --> 01:41:43,465
But you can't stop me
from looking at you.

1603
01:41:43,544 --> 01:41:46,945
Can everybody shut up and go to bed?

1604
01:41:47,014 --> 01:41:49,778
James, come on, wake up.

1605
01:41:49,884 --> 01:41:51,112
No.

1606
01:41:51,218 --> 01:41:52,185
James.

1607
01:41:56,957 --> 01:41:58,857
Come on, James, get up.

1608
01:42:05,065 --> 01:42:06,464
What?

1609
01:42:11,672 --> 01:42:13,663
What is this?

1610
01:42:13,741 --> 01:42:16,209
That's my notes.

1611
01:42:17,945 --> 01:42:20,004
What are you giving them to me for?

1612
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,843
Because you're debating, not me.

1613
01:42:21,949 --> 01:42:24,440
What?

1614
01:42:24,552 --> 01:42:26,486
lt's your turn, James.

1615
01:42:26,554 --> 01:42:27,919
You serious?

1616
01:42:29,356 --> 01:42:30,414
You're crazy.

1617
01:42:30,491 --> 01:42:32,652
At 1 4, you're just as good as me.

1618
01:42:32,726 --> 01:42:34,091
The judges will love you.

1619
01:42:34,161 --> 01:42:35,355
No. No. You can't quit.

1620
01:42:35,429 --> 01:42:37,454
l'm not quitting, Samantha.

1621
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:43,066
Tolson made me captain,
and he said you were ready.

1622
01:42:43,137 --> 01:42:45,002
Yeah, but you saw me at Howard.

1623
01:42:45,072 --> 01:42:46,266
l was horrible.

1624
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:47,864
That's right. You did terrible, didn't you?

1625
01:42:47,942 --> 01:42:49,239
Stunk up the whole joint, right?

1626
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:51,039
So you should just quit, right?

1627
01:42:51,111 --> 01:42:52,544
You should just give up.

1628
01:42:56,217 --> 01:42:57,206
No.

1629
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:04,924
Who's the judge?

1630
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:07,559
What?

1631
01:43:07,595 --> 01:43:09,722
Who's the judge?

1632
01:43:12,032 --> 01:43:14,193
The judge is God.

1633
01:43:15,469 --> 01:43:17,198
And why is he God?

1634
01:43:18,906 --> 01:43:23,741
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent.

1635
01:43:23,811 --> 01:43:26,746
And who is your opponent?

1636
01:43:26,814 --> 01:43:29,339
He doesn't exist.

1637
01:43:29,450 --> 01:43:32,214
Why doesn't he exist?

1638
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:34,810
Because he is a mere a dissenting voice

1639
01:43:34,922 --> 01:43:36,981
to the truth that l speak.

1640
01:43:39,727 --> 01:43:40,955
That's right.

1641
01:43:41,028 --> 01:43:43,019
Speak the truth.

1642
01:43:44,465 --> 01:43:47,025
Direct from Harvard Memorial Hall

1643
01:43:47,101 --> 01:43:48,966
in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

1644
01:43:49,036 --> 01:43:52,802
this is WNBC Radio,
bringing to you live

1645
01:43:52,873 --> 01:43:54,534
tonight's history-making debate

1646
01:43:54,608 --> 01:43:58,135
between little Wiley College
from Marshall, Texas,

1647
01:43:58,212 --> 01:44:00,612
and the Harvard University Debate team,

1648
01:44:00,748 --> 01:44:01,942
the first time ever

1649
01:44:02,049 --> 01:44:04,381
a Negro college has faced
the national champions.

1650
01:44:04,451 --> 01:44:05,509
Harvard's Dean of Students

1651
01:44:05,619 --> 01:44:07,484
is making his way to the podium now.

1652
01:44:07,521 --> 01:44:09,921
The crowd, as if on cue, falls silent.

1653
01:44:11,258 --> 01:44:13,192
On this historic occasion,

1654
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:16,195
we welcome the distinguished team
from Wiley College,

1655
01:44:16,263 --> 01:44:19,357
our illustrious judges, you the audience,

1656
01:44:19,433 --> 01:44:22,925
and through the wonder
of radio, the nation.

1657
01:44:23,003 --> 01:44:27,269
Harvard University celebrates
its 300th anniversary this year,

1658
01:44:27,341 --> 01:44:31,971
and, in Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
its fifth President of the United States.

1659
01:44:32,046 --> 01:44:35,982
<i>But no university, no matter how grand</i>
<i>or august in its history,</i>

1660
01:44:36,083 --> 01:44:38,608
<i>can afford to live in the past</i>.

1661
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:42,485
<i>So, in the spirit of tomorrow,</i>

1662
01:44:42,556 --> 01:44:45,491
<i>l introduce to you today.:</i>

1663
01:44:46,727 --> 01:44:48,695
the debaters from Wiley College:

1664
01:44:48,762 --> 01:44:50,127
Miss Samantha Booke,

1665
01:44:50,197 --> 01:44:52,188
Mr. James Farmer, Junior.

1666
01:44:53,601 --> 01:44:55,125
What?

1667
01:45:03,944 --> 01:45:07,345
Mr. Farmer will argue the first affirmative.

1668
01:45:26,567 --> 01:45:28,831
Resolved:

1669
01:45:28,902 --> 01:45:32,360
Civil disobedience is a moral weapon

1670
01:45:32,439 --> 01:45:35,374
in the fight for justice.

1671
01:45:35,442 --> 01:45:38,570
But how can disobedience
ever be moral?

1672
01:45:38,646 --> 01:45:40,011
Well, l guess that depends

1673
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,913
on one's definition of the words.

1674
01:45:43,017 --> 01:45:44,006
Word.

1675
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:48,887
ln 1919, in lndia,

1676
01:45:48,956 --> 01:45:53,620
10,000 people gathered in Amritsar
to protest the tyranny of British rule.

1677
01:45:53,694 --> 01:45:54,752
Has it started?

1678
01:45:54,828 --> 01:45:55,886
- Shh!
- Your brother's talking.

1679
01:45:55,963 --> 01:45:57,191
Just sit down.

1680
01:45:57,264 --> 01:46:00,427
General Reginald Dyer
trapped them in a courtyard

1681
01:46:00,567 --> 01:46:05,527
and ordered his troops
to fire into the crowd for ten minutes.

1682
01:46:05,606 --> 01:46:07,631
379 died--

1683
01:46:07,675 --> 01:46:12,806
men, women, children--

1684
01:46:12,846 --> 01:46:14,575
Shot down in cold blood.

1685
01:46:14,682 --> 01:46:19,119
Dyer said he had
taught them a moral lesson.

1686
01:46:19,219 --> 01:46:23,019
Gandhi and his followers responded
not with violence

1687
01:46:23,090 --> 01:46:27,390
but with an organized
campaign of non-cooperation.

1688
01:46:27,461 --> 01:46:30,123
Government buildings were occupied.

1689
01:46:30,197 --> 01:46:32,825
<i>Streets were blocked</i>
<i>with people who refused to rise,</i>

1690
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:35,801
<i>even when beaten by police</i>.

1691
01:46:35,869 --> 01:46:38,269
Gandhi was arrested,

1692
01:46:38,338 --> 01:46:41,637
but the British were soon
forced to release him.

1693
01:46:41,709 --> 01:46:45,839
He called it a moral victory.

1694
01:46:45,913 --> 01:46:48,245
The definition of moral:

1695
01:46:48,348 --> 01:46:52,751
Dyer's lesson or Gandhi's victory?

1696
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:54,287
You choose.

1697
01:47:12,039 --> 01:47:15,236
From 191 4 to 1918,

1698
01:47:15,309 --> 01:47:20,508
for every single minute
the world was at war,

1699
01:47:20,581 --> 01:47:24,574
four men laid down their lives.

1700
01:47:24,685 --> 01:47:27,119
Just think of it.

1701
01:47:27,187 --> 01:47:32,420
240 brave young men
were hurled into eternity

1702
01:47:32,493 --> 01:47:35,894
every hour of every day, of every night,

1703
01:47:35,963 --> 01:47:38,659
for four long years.

1704
01:47:40,634 --> 01:47:44,070
35,000 hours.

1705
01:47:44,138 --> 01:47:50,543
8,281 ,000 casualties.

1706
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:54,310
240.

1707
01:47:55,516 --> 01:47:57,643
240.

1708
01:47:57,751 --> 01:48:02,188
240.

1709
01:48:02,356 --> 01:48:03,789
Here was a slaughter

1710
01:48:03,857 --> 01:48:08,089
immeasurably greater than
what happened at Amritsar.

1711
01:48:08,128 --> 01:48:11,620
Can there be anything moral about it?

1712
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,399
Nothing...

1713
01:48:14,468 --> 01:48:16,299
except that it stopped Germany

1714
01:48:16,370 --> 01:48:18,270
from enslaving all of Europe.

1715
01:48:18,338 --> 01:48:23,207
Civil disobedience isn't moral
because it's non-violent.

1716
01:48:23,277 --> 01:48:26,246
Fighting for your country with violence

1717
01:48:26,313 --> 01:48:28,781
can be deeply moral,

1718
01:48:28,882 --> 01:48:34,047
demanding the greatest
sacrifice of all:

1719
01:48:34,154 --> 01:48:36,452
life itself.

1720
01:48:36,523 --> 01:48:39,959
Non-violence is the mask
civil disobedience wears

1721
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:43,587
to conceal its true face--

1722
01:48:43,664 --> 01:48:46,155
anarchy.

1723
01:48:57,611 --> 01:49:00,375
Gandhi believes one must always act

1724
01:49:00,547 --> 01:49:03,345
with love and respect
for one's opponents,

1725
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:05,975
even if they are Harvard debaters.

1726
01:49:07,588 --> 01:49:11,524
Gandhi also believes
that lawbreakers must accept

1727
01:49:11,592 --> 01:49:14,857
the legal consequences for their actions.

1728
01:49:14,928 --> 01:49:17,055
Does that sound like anarchy?

1729
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:22,397
Civil disobedience is not something
for us to fear.

1730
01:49:22,469 --> 01:49:25,495
lt is, after all, an American concept.

1731
01:49:25,572 --> 01:49:27,904
You see, Gandhi draws his inspiration

1732
01:49:27,975 --> 01:49:29,772
not from a Hindu scripture,

1733
01:49:29,843 --> 01:49:31,834
but from Henry David Thoreau,

1734
01:49:31,912 --> 01:49:34,437
who l believe graduated from Harvard

1735
01:49:34,548 --> 01:49:44,791
<i>and lived by a pond</i>
<i>not too far from here</i>.

1736
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:47,988
My opponent is right about one thing.

1737
01:49:48,061 --> 01:49:50,586
Thoreau was a Harvard grad,

1738
01:49:50,664 --> 01:49:55,397
and, like many of us, a bit self-righteous.

1739
01:49:57,905 --> 01:50:03,104
He once said, ''Any man
more right than his neighbors

1740
01:50:03,143 --> 01:50:06,874
constitutes a majority of one.''

1741
01:50:06,914 --> 01:50:10,645
Thoreau the idealist could never know

1742
01:50:10,751 --> 01:50:14,778
that Adolf Hitler
would agree with his words.

1743
01:50:14,888 --> 01:50:20,019
The beauty and the burden
of democracy is this:

1744
01:50:20,093 --> 01:50:25,463
no idea prevails without
the support of the majority.

1745
01:50:25,532 --> 01:50:28,365
The people decide
the moral issues of the day,

1746
01:50:28,435 --> 01:50:30,801
not a majority of one.

1747
01:50:30,871 --> 01:50:35,331
Majorities do not decide
what is right or wrong.

1748
01:50:35,409 --> 01:50:37,377
Your conscience does.

1749
01:50:37,444 --> 01:50:40,106
So why should a citizen

1750
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:42,671
surrender his or her conscience

1751
01:50:42,783 --> 01:50:44,114
to a legislator?

1752
01:50:44,217 --> 01:50:48,381
No, we must never, ever kneel down

1753
01:50:48,455 --> 01:50:51,356
before the tyranny of a majority.

1754
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:03,327
We can't decide which laws
to obey and which to ignore.

1755
01:51:03,470 --> 01:51:05,995
lf we could...

1756
01:51:06,073 --> 01:51:07,700
l'd never stop for a red light.

1757
01:51:09,576 --> 01:51:11,601
My father is one of those men

1758
01:51:11,678 --> 01:51:15,409
that stands between us and chaos:

1759
01:51:15,515 --> 01:51:17,983
a police officer.

1760
01:51:18,085 --> 01:51:24,024
l remember the day
his partner, his best friend,

1761
01:51:24,091 --> 01:51:26,753
was gunned down in the line of duty.

1762
01:51:28,762 --> 01:51:31,526
Most vividly of all,

1763
01:51:31,598 --> 01:51:35,090
l remember the expression
on my dad's face.

1764
01:51:37,204 --> 01:51:43,109
Nothing that erodes
the rule of law can be moral,

1765
01:51:43,176 --> 01:51:47,704
no matter what name we give it.

1766
01:51:50,217 --> 01:51:51,980
Bravo!

1767
01:52:36,129 --> 01:52:37,255
Why doesn't he say something?

1768
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:38,558
Shh!

1769
01:52:55,115 --> 01:52:58,676
ln Texas...

1770
01:52:58,785 --> 01:53:00,650
they lynch Negroes.

1771
01:53:03,056 --> 01:53:05,024
<i>My teammates and l</i>

1772
01:53:05,092 --> 01:53:09,358
saw a man strung up by his neck

1773
01:53:09,396 --> 01:53:10,954
and set on fire.

1774
01:53:13,433 --> 01:53:17,494
We drove through a lynch mob,

1775
01:53:17,571 --> 01:53:20,972
pressed our faces
against the floorboard.

1776
01:53:24,111 --> 01:53:27,137
l looked at my teammates.

1777
01:53:27,214 --> 01:53:30,240
l saw the fear in their eyes...

1778
01:53:32,652 --> 01:53:35,621
and worse...

1779
01:53:35,722 --> 01:53:36,984
the shame.

1780
01:53:40,227 --> 01:53:42,821
What was this Negro's crime

1781
01:53:42,896 --> 01:53:45,330
that he should be hung, without trial,

1782
01:53:45,398 --> 01:53:47,958
in a dark forest filled with fog?

1783
01:53:48,034 --> 01:53:52,027
Was he a thief?

1784
01:53:52,105 --> 01:53:55,233
Was he a killer?

1785
01:53:55,308 --> 01:53:56,832
Or just a Negro?

1786
01:53:59,112 --> 01:54:01,740
Was he a sharecropper?

1787
01:54:01,915 --> 01:54:04,042
<i>A preacher?</i>

1788
01:54:04,151 --> 01:54:07,177
<i>Were his children waiting up for him?</i>

1789
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:13,318
And who are we to just
lie there and do nothing?

1790
01:54:15,996 --> 01:54:21,195
No matter what he did,
the mob was the criminal.

1791
01:54:21,268 --> 01:54:24,567
But the law did nothing,

1792
01:54:24,638 --> 01:54:27,971
just left us wondering why.

1793
01:54:34,214 --> 01:54:36,079
My opponent says

1794
01:54:36,183 --> 01:54:40,347
nothing that erodes the rule
of law can be moral.

1795
01:54:40,453 --> 01:54:43,286
But there is no rule of law
in the Jim Crow South,

1796
01:54:43,356 --> 01:54:45,824
not when Negroes are denied housing,

1797
01:54:45,926 --> 01:54:48,451
turned away from schools, hospitals,

1798
01:54:48,528 --> 01:54:50,758
and not when we are lynched.

1799
01:54:55,302 --> 01:54:56,701
St. Augustine said,

1800
01:54:56,770 --> 01:55:01,298
''<i>An unjust law is no law at all,</i> ''

1801
01:55:01,441 --> 01:55:03,272
which means l have a right,

1802
01:55:03,343 --> 01:55:06,005
even a duty, to resist...

1803
01:55:08,348 --> 01:55:13,047
with violence or civil disobedience.

1804
01:55:17,424 --> 01:55:19,949
You should pray l choose the latter.

1805
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:35,433
Bravo!

1806
01:55:51,691 --> 01:55:52,953
<i>ln tonight</i>'<i>s debate</i>

1807
01:55:53,026 --> 01:55:58,726
between Harvard University
and Wiley College...

1808
01:56:02,002 --> 01:56:03,697
And the winner is...

1809
01:56:26,593 --> 01:56:28,254
Wiley College.

1810
01:56:28,328 --> 01:56:30,922
Yeah!
