1
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:29,799
Come on. Come on out.

2
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,499
You want something? wanna eat?

3
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:35,800
There's some food out here.

4
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,000
Here it is.
It's in the kitchen.

5
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:28,207
Good night, Sylvia.

6
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:36,408
Mirabelle Buttersfield
moved from Vermont.

7
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,808
Hoping to begin her life.

8
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:42,809
And now she is stranded
in the vast openness of L.A.

9
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,074
She keeps working
to make connections.

10
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:50,810
But the pile of near misses
is starting to overwhelm her.

11
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,811
What Mirabelle needs is an omniscient
voice to illuminate and spotlight her.

12
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,677
And to inform everyone
that this one has value.

13
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:07,112
This one. Standing behind the counter
in the glove department.

14
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:11,513
And then to find her counterpart
and bring him to her.

15
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:35,216
So...

16
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:39,782
You have a student loan of $39,452.

17
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,217
And you're currently
paying it off at the rate of...

18
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:46,918
- $45 a month.
- Yes.

19
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:50,218
Do you think that you could
increase that amount to...

20
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:52,619
Let me just see.

21
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:57,119
$160 a month?

22
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,220
Well, I...

23
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,120
I would love to, but...

24
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,621
That's just not gonna happen.

25
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:10,121
- Oh, really.
- Yeah.

26
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:25,323
Hey!

27
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:27,823
I mean, hello. Hi.

28
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:31,524
- Do you need change?
- No, I'm fine.

29
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,924
OK.

30
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,625
Where do you work?

31
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:45,126
- Saks.
- Oh. Saks.

32
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:47,226
Cool.

33
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:49,626
Saks...

34
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:54,127
Saks Fifth Avenue?

35
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:04,229
Where do you work?

36
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:06,829
Uh... in my studio.
I'm an artist.

37
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:09,029
- Oh, yeah? Me, too!
- Oh, really? What kind?

38
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,530
I draw. What do you do?

39
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,030
I'm involved in stenciling.
You know Holydog Amplifiers?

40
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,231
I do their logo.

41
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:26,832
Here, I'll show you.

42
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:33,298
These are, like, some fonts I did.
You know.

43
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,733
Like, this one by my thumb's
an older one, obviously. And, um...

44
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,934
This is my favorite one. I've called
this font "Los Angeles" because...

45
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:44,034
"Los Angeles. "
It's my favorite one.

46
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:46,434
I'm an OK guy, by the way.

47
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:51,935
You didn't have to tell me that.

48
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,335
I didn't? How come?

49
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:58,036
- Well, I could tell.
- Well, how could you tell?

50
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,436
'Cause I'm a really poor
judge of character.

51
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:04,437
I'm a poor judge of character as well.

52
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:06,937
The worst.

53
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,540
Excuse me, young lady.
Um, two things.

54
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,941
One: I was wondering if I could
now borrow change from you

55
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,141
because my stuff's still damp.

56
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,641
And two:

57
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:41,942
Um, I was wondering if I could please
have your phone number

58
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:44,642
so that I could...
I could call you.

59
00:09:47,943 --> 00:09:49,643
I'm Jeremy.

60
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:54,344
I will call you.

61
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:57,444
~ If you do want me

62
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,645
~ Gimme little sugar

63
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:01,945
~ If you don't want me

64
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:04,145
~ Don't lead me on, girl

65
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:06,210
~ But if you need me

66
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,746
~ Show me that you love me

67
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:11,546
~ And when I'm feeling blue

68
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:13,446
~ And I want you

69
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,547
~ There's just one thing

70
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,212
~ That you should do

71
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:21,898
~ Just gimme some kind of sign, girl

72
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:25,548
~ To show me that you're mine, girl

73
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:27,048
~ Oh. Yeah

74
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,849
~ Just gimme some kind of sign, girl...

75
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:33,149
Sorry.
I'll... I'll get it next time. Hey.

76
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,850
Sorry.

77
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,116
- Hi.
- Hi.

78
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:47,951
- You look nice.
- Yeah? Yeah, thanks.

79
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:49,451
All right.

80
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:52,117
Um, OK.

81
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:56,852
Get ready to have the time
of your life.

82
00:10:56,952 --> 00:10:58,953
OK.

83
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:01,953
I'm ready.

84
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:06,954
All right, young lady.

85
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,456
Fantastic, isn't it?

86
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:26,557
Yeah.

87
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,558
- Are we going in?
- Go in? Oh, no.

88
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:36,958
I just thought we'd look at it.

89
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:42,159
So... we would just sit here, then?

90
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,559
Yeah. Or walk around.

91
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:47,024
This place is called City walk.

92
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,960
It got eight out of ten
in my date book.

93
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,260
It's not called
"City-Go-and-See-a-Movie. "

94
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,961
Tickets are, like, ten bucks too, so...

95
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:02,262
I like it here. Peaceful.

96
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:05,462
I come here to think about fonts.

97
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:10,563
I've actually been
working on a font for you.

98
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,763
It's my most favorite one.

99
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:18,064
The Ls go like that.

100
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:22,964
- We could split it.
- OK. Let's split it.

101
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:24,765
Could I borrow two bucks?

102
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:36,166
Congratulations. You've officially
gone on a date with Jeremy.

103
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:40,367
Don't forget to hold the handle
when you lock the door.

104
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:46,768
- 52 steps. OK.
- OK.

105
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,668
- Well, thanks for driving me.
- Can I see your place?

106
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:54,269
I think I should go to bed.
I'm pretty tired.

107
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:55,769
Cool.

108
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:57,769
So...

109
00:12:57,869 --> 00:12:59,870
- Good night.
- Oh, OK. OK, OK.

110
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,670
Well, here, let me give you my number.

111
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,970
Uh...

112
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,570
- You got a pen?
- Oh.

113
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,071
Uh, yeah. I do.

114
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,771
- You got paper?
- Oh.

115
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:16,072
Yeah, I do.

116
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:21,773
How high is that?
You ever jump off that? I would jump it.

117
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,874
- Mirabelle?
- Yeah?

118
00:13:29,374 --> 00:13:31,374
Can I kiss you or what?

119
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:36,475
The point being?

120
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:44,676
Thank you.

121
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:48,676
Oh, hey, you look...
you look good, too.

122
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:54,377
- See you later.
- Hey, Jeremy?

123
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:56,277
Yeah?

124
00:13:58,378 --> 00:14:01,078
Are you the kind of person
it takes time to get to know,

125
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:05,579
and then, once you get to know them...
they're fabulous?

126
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,479
- Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
- OK.

127
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,479
What? Yes.

128
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,480
- OK.
- OK.

129
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,280
No? OK.

130
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,481
I love you.
No kiss. Good night.

131
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:22,881
Good night.

132
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:27,682
Night!

133
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:10,588
You see. Susan.
Your husband doesn't understand

134
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:13,488
that it's afterglow
that's important to a woman.

135
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:16,288
- Uh-huh.
- Much more important than sex itself.

136
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:19,189
- Hm.
- A woman needs to be held.

137
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,589
Even if.
And science has shown this.

138
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:24,190
- It's by someone she doesn't care about.
- Uh-huh.

139
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,790
Protective hormones are released.
And the amount of hormones released

140
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:31,991
depend on the degree
to which she is held.

141
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:35,491
The first and best
is the complete surround.

142
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:39,692
He wraps you in both arms.
whispers how beautiful you are.

143
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:42,292
Second best is the arm around.

144
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:45,993
He's next to you.
But with one arm around you.

145
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:49,058
Third is. He's just next to you on his elbow.

146
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:53,359
But he rests his hand on your stomach
and looks at you.

147
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:57,494
Fourth is you snuggling up to him
with your head on his chest.

148
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:00,095
while he looks away into space.

149
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:07,195
But when the first best happens. You feel
completely. wonderfully like a woman.

150
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:15,397
Once a year. we have
to feed our crocs a whole carcass.

151
00:16:16,397 --> 00:16:18,297
God, OK.

152
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:22,798
From the skin. Fur. Bones...

153
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:24,698
Jeremy?

154
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:28,598
...around a wild crocodile
because I'd be within strike range...

155
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:31,099
- Jeremy?
... got a mouthful of pig.

156
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,899
He's bringing it into the shallows.

157
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,099
Jeremy?

158
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,665
we've never seen him do it.
Let's hope he does it.

159
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,200
He'll pick it up out of the water.
Sink his teeth into it. And then...

160
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,801
Jeremy!

161
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:45,901
wow.

162
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:51,202
Jeremy!

163
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:56,302
watch this. Here we go.
See his tail sticking up?

164
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:58,903
Oh. He's ripped it.

165
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:01,703
Whoo! And here he goes again.

166
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:04,403
Yeah!

167
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:14,405
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hello...

168
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:17,405
- Hello?
- Hello. Hey.

169
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,306
Is this... Is this Jeremy?

170
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:22,406
Yeah.

171
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:27,507
- Do you know who this is?
- Yeah. It's Mirabelle.

172
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,807
Did you just dial me?

173
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,907
Yeah.

174
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:35,008
Uh... did you know that...

175
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:38,908
- Um...
- Um... what?

176
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,008
Uh...

177
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:42,809
- That you what?
- That, uh...

178
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,509
- Oh...
- What?

179
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:46,209
Nothing.

180
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,210
- Oh.
- Oh, God.

181
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,210
OK, well, um...

182
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,210
Mirabelle...

183
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,011
I was wondering
if you want me to come over.

184
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,111
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

185
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:04,112
Yeah. I'm just hanging out, really.

186
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:05,212
- Oh. Great.
- Yeah.

187
00:18:05,312 --> 00:18:08,512
- OK. I'm gonna come over then.
- OK.

188
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:12,413
- Like. when?
- Well, um...

189
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:16,913
I'm in the middle
of a lot of things right now, so...

190
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,014
maybe, like, in ten minutes?

191
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,915
Hi.

192
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:27,915
Hi.

193
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:30,515
- I brought fries.
- I can tell.

194
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:33,116
How could you tell?

195
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:37,916
- I can see through the bag.
- Oh, yeah. They're really good.

196
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:44,617
- Come on in.
- Yeah? Great.

197
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:47,318
Oh, great place, man.

198
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:13,021
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

199
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,922
- That's OK. Hey, is that the bedroom?
- What?

200
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,922
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

201
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:54,327
- We'll need a condom.
- Oh, oh. I got it, I got it, I got it.

202
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:00,128
- Oh, shit.
- What?

203
00:20:00,228 --> 00:20:03,128
- It's a mint.
- What?

204
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:07,829
I... I grabbed the wrong package.

205
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:10,129
It's a mint, not a condom.

206
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:13,330
- Do you have one?
- No.

207
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,730
This is stupid.

208
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,731
Ooh, yeah!

209
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:23,731
Do you have, um, a baggie?

210
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,731
- What?
- If you had, like, a Jiffy baggie,

211
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:30,432
Well, I could, like, use that, you know?

212
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:32,832
Oh, God.

213
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:40,533
- You're going to have to go and get one.
- OK. Cool.

214
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:42,534
- Where do you keep them?
- What?

215
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:46,234
The Jiffy baggies.
Where do you keep them?

216
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:49,235
No, a condom.

217
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:53,035
kind of breaks the romantic mood.

218
00:20:57,936 --> 00:21:00,236
Do you want to just hug?

219
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,737
Yeah.

220
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,938
Say, excuse me, bro?

221
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:23,239
- That was quick.
- Yeah.

222
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,640
- Where'd you get it?
- Well, I was out there,

223
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,241
and I bumped into your neighbor, Kenny.
I just asked him if he had any...

224
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:35,341
- Oh, God.
... and he does, so great.

225
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:40,742
Do you still want to do it?

226
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:45,642
Do you want a massage?

227
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:24,448
- Ow!
- What happened?

228
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:28,748
- Ow! Someone's hitting my balls.
- Someone?

229
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,349
Bad Sylvia!

230
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:34,649
I'm sorry. Ow! Are you OK?

231
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:38,050
Yeah, it's like someone
throwing marshmallows at me.

232
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:40,615
- Ow.
- Are you OK to?

233
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,850
Yeah. Does this happen often?

234
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:46,851
Yeah. Every night.

235
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:52,952
Maybe I should just go home.

236
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:55,852
No.

237
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:57,652
No, stay.

238
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:13,655
Amplifiers are so underappreciated.

239
00:23:13,755 --> 00:23:15,355
What?

240
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:19,855
They could be so cool-looking, and nobody
cares about design. It pisses me off.

241
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:23,956
Mac designs a cool computer -
everybody goes out and they buy it!

242
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:27,657
And a band, a rock-and-roll band,

243
00:23:27,757 --> 00:23:31,857
lives or dies by their amplifiers,

244
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:34,858
and they're sold like refrigerators.

245
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:39,458
That's ridiculous, come on.
The amps should have mystique.

246
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:42,759
I mean, yeah.
Amps should be sold like cool things.

247
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:47,459
You know, like cars, like swords.
Not like appliances.

248
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,960
And that is why
my boss's business is going under.

249
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,360
Because he views it all as merch.
That's merchandise.

250
00:23:57,661 --> 00:23:59,661
You should do something about it.

251
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:03,562
Huh?

252
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:07,862
He's never coming to one
of my parties again. Never.

253
00:24:07,962 --> 00:24:10,462
They both looked so fat.

254
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:15,263
- Ugh. The worst.
- The second floor is great.

255
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:17,864
You want something?
Seen anything you want?

256
00:24:17,964 --> 00:24:21,464
Nothing here.
But that Stella McCartney dress is good.

257
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:23,864
Perfect.

258
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,565
- Excuse me?
- Oh. Yes, I'm sorry.

259
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:33,166
- Is he famous?
- He's on that show Extraterrestrials.

260
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:36,466
- Oh, I haven't seen that.
- Neither have I.

261
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:39,166
How'd you know who he was, then?

262
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:41,467
Osmosis.

263
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:46,267
- would you like to see something?
- Um, yeah.

264
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:49,868
Those gray ones
and those black ones.

265
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:52,433
OK.

266
00:24:52,468 --> 00:24:55,069
How does it work?
Is it one size fits all, or?

267
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:58,269
They come in different sizes
but mostly they'll fit anybody.

268
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:00,269
Unless...

269
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,470
you know, she's...

270
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,770
big.

271
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,471
- I don't know. What do you think?
- Well, it depends on the dress.

272
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:13,871
What color is the dress?

273
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,172
Um...

274
00:25:16,272 --> 00:25:19,572
I'll just...
I'll just get the gray ones.

275
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:22,673
Safe.

276
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,373
Safe?

277
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:27,173
why, do you think the black?

278
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:31,874
- I like the black.
- OK, I'll take the black.

279
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:34,974
OK.

280
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:39,975
It's $145.

281
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:44,576
- Just put it in there.
- OK.

282
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,976
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

283
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:09,279
Jerry. I need
your timecard in the office.

284
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,581
OK. Chet!

285
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:24,846
What?

286
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:28,482
- Hey. You know what I've been thinking?
- I have no idea.

287
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:32,682
Well, how could you? I'm the one
who's thinking it, obviously. Listen, Chet,

288
00:26:32,782 --> 00:26:36,483
Who hangs out with
rock musicians on the road?

289
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:38,883
- Who?
- Other rock musicians.

290
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:42,484
And?

291
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:45,384
If you had someone
on the road with the band,

292
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:49,485
you know, a band that uses our stuff, with
someone who looks real sharp, you know,

293
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:51,950
someone the musicians could relate to,

294
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,585
bet you could sell
a lot more stuff that way.

295
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:57,886
- Do you have someone in mind?
- Yeah.

296
00:26:57,986 --> 00:26:59,986
Me.

297
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:05,787
Think about it.

298
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,889
Here, smell.

299
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:23,489
Mm.

300
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:27,998
- Arigato.
- Arigato.

301
00:28:28,198 --> 00:28:30,499
- Arigato.
- Arigato.

302
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,999
- Arigato.
- Arigato!

303
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:35,499
- Arigato.
- Arigato.

304
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,865
- Did you get my package?
- Oh!

305
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,701
It seems I'm sneaking up on you,
but I'm not.

306
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:47,501
- I was distracted by global commerce.
- Yeah.

307
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,501
So, did you get my package?

308
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:53,502
Uh, yes. Thank you.

309
00:28:55,102 --> 00:28:56,402
And?

310
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:01,703
- Who are you?
- Good point. I'm Ray Porter. How are you?

311
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:02,903
Hi.

312
00:29:06,504 --> 00:29:09,569
Look, I know you can't
be seen chatting up customers,

313
00:29:09,604 --> 00:29:13,004
so why don't you just meet me Friday
for dinner at La Ronde,

314
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,970
that little place in Beverly Hills,
at eight o'clock.

315
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:19,305
You don't even have to give me
your phone number, just show up,

316
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:22,306
and if you don't, I'll just eat alone.

317
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:27,706
What was the name of the restaurant?

318
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:30,507
- La Ronde.
- What time?

319
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:32,907
Eight.

320
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,816
- You're on time.
- why not?

321
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:38,916
- Many people aren't.
- Oh, thank you.

322
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:43,617
- Would you like something to drink?
- Red wine.

323
00:30:43,652 --> 00:30:45,617
What shade?

324
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:47,518
- Maroon.
- All right.

325
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:52,018
We'll have some of that fancy
maroon wine that you have.

326
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:00,719
So.

327
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,120
Who are you?

328
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:05,420
I'm a logician.

329
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,320
Meaning you work with numbers?

330
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,221
- I work with symbols.
- So you're a symbolic logician.

331
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:16,222
Exactly.

332
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:20,422
You're very well dressed
for a symbolic logician.

333
00:31:22,022 --> 00:31:24,523
So how did you get my address?

334
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:27,723
Well, I lied to Saks,

335
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:30,223
then made one phone call to Information.

336
00:31:30,258 --> 00:31:32,624
You have an unusual name -
Buttersfield.

337
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:37,524
Mirabelle Buttersfield.

338
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:48,126
while Ray explains his presumption
in getting her address and sending gloves.

339
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:52,026
Mirabelle sizes him up
and no alarm bells sound.

340
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:59,828
She asks several questions and gets
a kind of checklist for a man over 50:

341
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:01,928
Divorced. Two houses.

342
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:05,628
One in L.A. And one
in the computer-oriented Seattle.

343
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:08,629
which is the source of his wealth.

344
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,930
So...

345
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,231
would you give me your phone number?

346
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:25,431
Yes.

347
00:32:25,531 --> 00:32:28,532
But the one question
she does not ask him.

348
00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:32,932
which is foremost in her mind.
Is: "why me?"

349
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:47,834
- Hey!
- Hi.

350
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:50,035
Mind if I join you?

351
00:32:58,636 --> 00:33:01,636
we see each other,
but we don't know each other.

352
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:04,837
- I'm Lisa.
- Mirabelle.

353
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:16,038
You ever have men
ask you out at the store?

354
00:33:16,138 --> 00:33:17,738
Daily.

355
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:21,739
- And do you ever go out with them?
- Depends.

356
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:26,640
Somebody ask you out?

357
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,140
You want some advice?

358
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,141
You never call him.

359
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:37,541
But if he calls you, you talk to him,
then act like you have another call,

360
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,741
keep him on hold for a long time,

361
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:42,792
like longer than you think is possible.

362
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:45,707
And break dates.
Always break dates.

363
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:49,843
Right around the holidays,
because then he's just stuck.

364
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:52,643
And fellatio.
The sooner the better.

365
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:56,144
And a lot. Act like you love it.

366
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:58,844
Afterhe'saddicted, cut him off.

367
00:33:58,944 --> 00:34:01,744
That's when you've got him.

368
00:34:01,844 --> 00:34:04,845
Yeah, I couldn't do all that.

369
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:08,145
- How come?
- I'm from Vermont.

370
00:34:32,749 --> 00:34:35,249
- Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:37,749
- May I come in?
- Yeah, please.

372
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,500
I think I can see
your apartment from my house.

373
00:34:42,535 --> 00:34:44,950
- Really?
- Yeah, I live near the observatory,

374
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,751
and I can see the observatory
from your steps.

375
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:55,252
- Well, do you want to go, or stay?
- Well...

376
00:34:55,352 --> 00:34:59,152
- Do you want to sit down?
- Yeah. Great. Thanks.

377
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:01,853
Oh.

378
00:35:01,953 --> 00:35:03,353
Hm.

379
00:35:03,453 --> 00:35:05,653
- Do you want something to drink?
- Pardon me?

380
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:08,054
- A drink?
- Uh, yeah. What do you have?

381
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:09,154
Uh...

382
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:11,754
- white wine?
- That's great.

383
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,956
- It's a nice neighborhood.
- Yeah, I really like it.

384
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:29,757
Mm-hm.

385
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:45,359
- Ah. Thank you.
- Sure.

386
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:51,460
Hm.

387
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,060
Uh...

388
00:35:57,561 --> 00:36:00,661
- Should we go?
- Yeah, let's go.

389
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:04,061
Whoa, boy. Let's... Yeah.

390
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:08,462
It's a futon, right? Yeah. Futon.

391
00:36:09,662 --> 00:36:13,463
You'll like the Cha Cha Cha.
It's fun. Whoo-hoo!

392
00:36:21,864 --> 00:36:23,464
So...

393
00:36:24,464 --> 00:36:28,765
- You know what you're gonna have?
- Yeah, I always get the jerk chicken.

394
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,165
Is that an order or a comment?

395
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,866
OK, we need some date questions.

396
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:40,567
So let's see... where's your family live?

397
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:43,367
Vermont.

398
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,667
Good relationship
with your father, I hope?

399
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:49,868
Well...

400
00:36:51,368 --> 00:36:54,268
My dad doesn't speak very much.

401
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:56,169
After Vietnam.

402
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:00,169
Um...

403
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:02,670
OK. Be honest, maybe.

404
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,770
If this were a TV dating show,

405
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:09,270
would I be kicked off already
and you'd be on to the next guy?

406
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,671
Uh...

407
00:37:12,971 --> 00:37:16,171
- You'd still be on the show.
- Good.

408
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,823
- I like your watch.
- Thank you.

409
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:26,973
It's a pretty unassuming Timex.

410
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:32,374
Yeah, but I'm out of date questions
and so I'm on to date comments.

411
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:52,476
Now I'm your watch.

412
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:07,929
Well, um, it was very nice.

413
00:38:07,964 --> 00:38:10,871
- was I boring?
- No, was I?

414
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:13,779
A little bit.

415
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,280
Well, OK.

416
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,281
- I don't think that you should come in.
- I'm not asking to.

417
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:27,381
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

418
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:30,482
I'll see you again?

419
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:33,482
Oh. OK.

420
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:42,183
I'll be out of town about a week.

421
00:38:42,283 --> 00:38:45,284
But would you like
to have dinner on Friday?

422
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:47,684
we could eat at my place.

423
00:38:49,084 --> 00:38:50,885
OK.

424
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:28,490
Bobby Simmons is struggling in
this second half. He's only two for seven.

425
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,990
And both of them have members down.

426
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:36,291
He's got to get
better help from his receiver...

427
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:53,293
...Simmons is looking long.
He scrambles left. Oh. There's a big block...

428
00:39:57,894 --> 00:40:00,694
...and see what he can find.
And Simmons with a long pass...

429
00:40:00,794 --> 00:40:05,195
It's Simmons with the touchdown!

430
00:40:22,697 --> 00:40:28,398
~ Here she comes
breaking through my window

431
00:40:29,798 --> 00:40:35,599
~ In the early morning hours

432
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:43,700
~ For the moment I am disrupted

433
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:51,001
~ But in time
she'll make me smile

434
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:57,602
~ All the wondrous animals...

435
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:11,604
~ Bring us songs that calm

436
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,605
~ They do no wrong

437
00:41:15,705 --> 00:41:19,405
~ They do no wrong

438
00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:27,106
~ Just how much I miss you

439
00:41:28,106 --> 00:41:32,907
~ Yeah, my stomach aches
in your absence

440
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:42,708
~ I don't know
what I'd do without you

441
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,009
- Man, you saved our ass tonight.
- Oh, no sweat.

442
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:48,909
- What was that amp?
- Holydog. It's the amp's amp.

443
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:52,510
You know, it's the one
I've been telling you about for three weeks.

444
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,110
Luther, see you on the bus, man.

445
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:00,011
- You want some dope?
- I'm afraid I'm gonna have to just say no.

446
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:02,811
- Good answer.
- I'm into athletics.

447
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:06,612
- Whatever. You want to ride with us?
- What?

448
00:42:06,712 --> 00:42:09,512
- we got an extra bunk. Come on.
- Ride with you?

449
00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:11,912
Yeah. Great. All right.

450
00:42:12,012 --> 00:42:14,713
Let me get my gear,
I got to expedite a couple things...

451
00:42:14,813 --> 00:42:17,113
- Come on!
- All right!

452
00:42:36,616 --> 00:42:37,916
Hello?

453
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:41,967
Hey. It's Jeremy. Jere-me.
What are you doing?

454
00:42:42,002 --> 00:42:45,917
- You mean now?
- Yeah. I want you to come over.

455
00:42:49,018 --> 00:42:51,818
- It's too late.
- It's not too late.

456
00:42:52,818 --> 00:42:55,018
It is for me. I have to get up.

457
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:57,119
Come over.

458
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:01,319
- I can't.
- Come on.

459
00:43:01,354 --> 00:43:03,520
No.

460
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,820
Oh, come on,
I'm leaving town for a couple months.

461
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,921
- I can't.
- why not?

462
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:15,921
Because I'm seeing someone.

463
00:43:52,026 --> 00:43:54,027
You have a nice house.

464
00:43:54,127 --> 00:43:57,427
- Do you think it's too done?
- No. No, it's nice.

465
00:43:57,527 --> 00:44:01,628
I didn't do it. It was
like this when I bought it.

466
00:44:01,728 --> 00:44:04,093
Do you want to sit down?

467
00:44:04,128 --> 00:44:06,128
- Or do you want to go outside?
- OK.

468
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:08,229
Do you want some wine?

469
00:44:08,264 --> 00:44:10,829
Uh, later.

470
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,930
OK, yeah.

471
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:22,581
OK, there's the termite sign
and then down from that...

472
00:44:22,616 --> 00:44:26,131
Yes! I can see your building
but not your apartment.

473
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,831
Take a look. See the blue sign?

474
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,332
Um, yeah.

475
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:33,732
Then right below that,
Silver Lake Boulevard. Now go over.

476
00:44:33,832 --> 00:44:35,432
- Oh, yeah.
- See?

477
00:44:35,532 --> 00:44:36,633
Huh.

478
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:43,233
Oh!

479
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:47,634
- You all right?
- Yes.

480
00:44:48,934 --> 00:44:51,235
Did it pinch you?

481
00:44:53,535 --> 00:44:56,635
There's a dealer on La Brea
who takes my drawings.

482
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,636
And they sell one occasionally.

483
00:44:59,736 --> 00:45:03,936
- How often do you do one?
- About every six months.

484
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:06,637
why so few?

485
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,137
I don't know, really.

486
00:45:11,137 --> 00:45:13,838
You sure you don't want some wine?

487
00:45:13,938 --> 00:45:16,838
I'm sure. Thank you.

488
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:22,539
You want to see the rest of the house?

489
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:25,639
Let's go.

490
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,241
That's the three...
Got all three type recycle bins.

491
00:45:38,441 --> 00:45:40,641
And the whole laundry room.

492
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:43,442
All the closets.

493
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:46,642
This just...
See, you just put things in there.

494
00:45:49,143 --> 00:45:50,643
Garage.

495
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,145
The bedroom.

496
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:12,146
Nice view.

497
00:47:03,753 --> 00:47:06,753
Let me turn off the phones.

498
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:20,955
Hi. It's Ray Porter.
Leave a message.

499
00:48:22,964 --> 00:48:27,064
- All right. Here's where you sleep.
- OK, cool.

500
00:48:27,164 --> 00:48:31,265
Here's your headphones.
Go to sleep with the music.

501
00:48:32,965 --> 00:48:36,666
- Come on, we're gonna make Mojitos.
- Right.

502
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:39,166
- What's a Mojito?
- A fancy drink.

503
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:40,866
All right.

504
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:52,868
I want to fly!

505
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:57,969
Yeah!

506
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:00,669
Yeah!

507
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:17,671
Relax.

508
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:22,372
Relax your toes and breathe.

509
00:49:24,872 --> 00:49:27,873
Relax your ankles and breathe.

510
00:49:28,873 --> 00:49:32,173
Feel your hands. Flex them.

511
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:38,374
Fix your eyes
on an object in front of you.

512
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:41,140
Quiet your mind.

513
00:49:41,175 --> 00:49:45,475
Feel the sensation of being alive.

514
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:14,779
Hey.

515
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:16,880
Is it OK if I make a speech?

516
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,380
OK.

517
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,480
Um...

518
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,781
I wasn't really looking
for anything permanent right now.

519
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:27,181
But I really like seeing you.

520
00:50:28,381 --> 00:50:31,582
I'm just traveling so much right now...

521
00:50:32,682 --> 00:50:35,082
that I thought maybe we should just...

522
00:50:35,182 --> 00:50:37,483
keep our options open.

523
00:50:40,183 --> 00:50:44,083
- Do you understand?
- I do.

524
00:50:47,784 --> 00:50:52,285
OK, Miss Mirabelle of the fourth
floor, how did it go with the glove man?

525
00:50:52,385 --> 00:50:55,050
Oh, yeah! Tell us all about it.

526
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,485
Spill it. Do you like him?
Does he like you?

527
00:50:58,585 --> 00:51:02,386
Well, he said he was surprised
that he was interested in me.

528
00:51:03,286 --> 00:51:05,286
Um...

529
00:51:05,386 --> 00:51:09,387
I told her there was no possibility
that this was a long-term relationship.

530
00:51:09,487 --> 00:51:12,687
She's just really too young for me.

531
00:51:12,787 --> 00:51:16,688
- But you want to sleep with her?
- Well, yeah.

532
00:51:16,788 --> 00:51:19,653
He said he wants to give it a try.

533
00:51:19,688 --> 00:51:24,089
And I said that even though
this is not long-term, I still want to see her.

534
00:51:24,189 --> 00:51:26,789
- And she understood?
- Oh, yeah.

535
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,990
He said he wants
to cut down on his traveling.

536
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:34,090
I essentially said that I'd like to sleep 
with her when I'm in town.

537
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:39,491
He said he might, you know, stop traveling
completely. Then we'd decide what to do.

538
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:41,991
Even though it's a sexual relationship,

539
00:51:42,092 --> 00:51:44,992
uh, we still should be able
to see other people.

540
00:51:45,092 --> 00:51:48,092
So he was really taken with you?

541
00:51:49,493 --> 00:51:51,993
Yeah, it seemed like it.

542
00:51:52,093 --> 00:51:56,393
So you were really clear with her
that this relationship has no future?

543
00:51:56,428 --> 00:51:58,694
Absolutely.

544
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:02,994
Well, you know how to find out
if he really loves you?

545
00:52:03,094 --> 00:52:04,295
How?

546
00:52:04,395 --> 00:52:08,295
You call him "sweetheart"
and watch what he does.

547
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,496
~ I don't know what it is
that makes me love you so

548
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:20,497
~ I only know I never
want to let you go

549
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:23,797
~ 'Cause you've started something.
Oh. Can't you see?

550
00:52:24,897 --> 00:52:28,698
~ That ever since we met
you've had a hold on me

551
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:32,298
~ It happens to be true

552
00:52:32,398 --> 00:52:35,064
~ I only want to be with you

553
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:38,699
~ It doesn't matter
where you go or what you do

554
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:42,400
~ I want to spend each moment
of the day with you

555
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,100
~ Oh. look what has happened
with just one kiss

556
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,001
~ I never knew that I could
be in love like this

557
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:53,501
~ It's crazy but it's true

558
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:57,002
~ I only want to be with you

559
00:52:58,002 --> 00:53:00,902
~ You stopped and smiled at me

560
00:53:01,002 --> 00:53:04,703
~ Asked if I'd care to dance

561
00:53:04,738 --> 00:53:08,403
~ I fell into your open arms

562
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:11,204
~ And I didn't stand a chance

563
00:53:11,304 --> 00:53:15,804
~ Now. Hear me tell ya.
I just want to be beside you everywhere

564
00:53:15,905 --> 00:53:19,505
~ As long as we're together.
Honey. I don't care

565
00:53:19,605 --> 00:53:23,206
~ 'Cause you've started something.
Oh. Can't you see?

566
00:53:23,306 --> 00:53:26,906
~ That ever since we've met
you've had a hold on me

567
00:53:27,006 --> 00:53:30,171
~ No matter what you do

568
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:34,207
~ I said. I only
want to be with you

569
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:44,909
We've been listening
to the same tapes for weeks.

570
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:47,009
What do you say we get some new stuff?

571
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:49,509
- What do they got?
- Um...

572
00:53:50,609 --> 00:53:54,610
Mostly yoga, Pilates, gyrotechnics.

573
00:53:54,645 --> 00:53:56,810
Hey, look at these.

574
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,910
- How to Love a woman.
- Yeah.

575
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,876
- You need that one.
- What?

576
00:54:01,911 --> 00:54:04,911
Hm. Here's more relationship stuff.

577
00:54:06,512 --> 00:54:09,612
- Here.
- we're getting it?

578
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:12,812
Let's just get 'em all.
we're on the road till February.

579
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:14,813
Um, OK.

580
00:54:14,913 --> 00:54:16,013
- All right?
- All right.

581
00:54:16,113 --> 00:54:17,478
- All right.
- All right.

582
00:54:17,513 --> 00:54:20,513
Um, I guess we'll love women now.

583
00:54:21,814 --> 00:54:24,979
- Happy Birthday.
- Thank you, mister!

584
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:29,515
- Anything you don't like you can take back.
- I never return anything you give me.

585
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:32,915
Maybe you've got a stash of stuff
you're dying to take back,

586
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:36,516
- just waiting for me to say it's OK.
- Silly.

587
00:54:36,616 --> 00:54:39,216
By the way, you know,
my birthday's tomorrow.

588
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:44,317
It is really? OK. You know what that is?
That is a computer error.

589
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:48,017
I am going to fix that,
and next year everything will be perfect.

590
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:52,018
Next year? Next year?

591
00:54:52,118 --> 00:54:54,518
Next year you'll be dead.

592
00:54:57,019 --> 00:54:59,019
Do you want to open them tomorrow, then?

593
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,019
No, I love gifts.

594
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,221
Oh, my God.

595
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:13,021
It's beautiful!

596
00:55:13,121 --> 00:55:16,921
- You like it?
- I love it! Thank you so much.

597
00:55:16,956 --> 00:55:18,422
- Should I try it on?
- Yes.

598
00:55:18,522 --> 00:55:20,522
Yes.

599
00:55:23,122 --> 00:55:26,123
I got to go to New York
in about six weeks for an event weekend.

600
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:29,823
- You want to go? Could you get off?
- Oh, my God, yes!

601
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:32,288
You're going to need a dress.

602
00:55:32,323 --> 00:55:36,524
- What kind of dress?
- It's a tuxedo thing. So whatever that is.

603
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,724
I could take you to Armani next week.

604
00:55:44,025 --> 00:55:46,225
You look beautiful.

605
00:56:35,132 --> 00:56:37,132
Excuse me.

606
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:43,983
Ray?

607
00:56:44,018 --> 00:56:46,034
What?

608
00:56:46,434 --> 00:56:49,834
I've never had a dress
fitted on me before.

609
00:56:54,635 --> 00:56:58,435
Feel the sensation
of being alive.

610
00:56:58,535 --> 00:57:02,136
Feel what it means to be alive.

611
00:57:02,936 --> 00:57:08,837
Only from this place of pure existence
can you begin to change.

612
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:11,754
To turn yourself into a being

613
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:14,638
capable of loving another person.

614
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:25,439
Hey, you're going to be late.

615
00:57:26,439 --> 00:57:28,139
You all right?

616
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,440
- I feel good.
- I feel good, too.

617
00:57:50,243 --> 00:57:55,043
- I think I like the look of the brown ones.
- would you like...

618
00:58:04,745 --> 00:58:06,945
Are you all right?

619
00:58:07,045 --> 00:58:08,945
Yes. I'm fine, thank you.

620
00:58:11,746 --> 00:58:15,646
I'll be back
in about five minutes.

621
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:03,653
Hey. It's Ray. You haven't returned
my calls. Are you all right?

622
00:59:03,688 --> 00:59:05,153
I'm fine.

623
00:59:05,653 --> 00:59:08,753
- You don't sound fine.
- I'm OK.

624
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:13,354
Hey, guess what? I'm not hanging up
until you tell me what's wrong.

625
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:23,055
- Have you ever taken antidepressants?
- No.

626
00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:28,456
I do.

627
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:31,357
But I stopped.

628
00:59:33,557 --> 00:59:35,257
And?

629
00:59:35,357 --> 00:59:37,257
And, uh,

630
00:59:37,357 --> 00:59:41,958
the doctor says that
maybe I shouldn't have.

631
00:59:42,558 --> 00:59:46,859
All right. I'm going to come over there and
get you and we're going to go to the doctor.

632
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:49,959
You call him
and let him know we're coming.

633
01:00:33,565 --> 01:00:35,866
Hey, I have something for you.

634
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:46,967
What's this?

635
01:00:47,067 --> 01:00:51,968
I know it's a month away,
but it's your ticket to New York City.

636
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,469
Thanks.

637
01:02:07,778 --> 01:02:10,579
- Hello?
- You're there.

638
01:02:10,614 --> 01:02:11,679
Just.

639
01:02:12,879 --> 01:02:16,945
- Hey, do you have plans for tonight?
- Somewhat.

640
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:20,280
Could you cancel them?
I could be there in three hours.

641
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,481
I could cancel them.

642
01:02:25,481 --> 01:02:27,981
Good. Have you eaten yet?

643
01:02:29,081 --> 01:02:31,482
No. I wanted to wait.

644
01:02:31,582 --> 01:02:35,382
- Well. I'll bring some food from the plane.
- Plane food?

645
01:02:35,482 --> 01:02:37,682
Private plane food.

646
01:03:56,593 --> 01:04:01,294
Hi. It's Mirabelle. Leave your name
and number and I'll call you back.

647
01:04:01,394 --> 01:04:03,694
Oh, hey, Mirabelle's machine,
it's Jeremy.

648
01:04:03,794 --> 01:04:07,260
I'm calling you from the road. Um...

649
01:04:07,295 --> 01:04:11,295
And I was calling to wish you
a happy Thanksgiving and all that.

650
01:04:11,395 --> 01:04:13,696
And...

651
01:04:15,196 --> 01:04:21,597
"I think I objectified you instead of treating
you like the unique being that you are. "

652
01:04:21,697 --> 01:04:23,097
And, even better,

653
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:27,398
I get to use the roadie from the Hot Tears'
cell phone for free - no charge -

654
01:04:27,498 --> 01:04:29,498
so I'm calling you for free.

655
01:04:32,898 --> 01:04:36,499
- why are you leaving for work at 7:45?
- I got to go home and change.

656
01:04:36,534 --> 01:04:37,964
Oh. Oh.

657
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:41,100
- That could take an hour.
- I know.

658
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,700
Do you want to stay
at my place sometime?

659
01:04:50,801 --> 01:04:53,466
I live ten minutes from Saks.
Next time you come over,

660
01:04:53,501 --> 01:04:57,902
just leave some clothes here
and you can go to work from here.

661
01:04:58,002 --> 01:05:00,002
OK.

662
01:05:01,402 --> 01:05:04,203
I won't be able
to see you till after Thanksgiving.

663
01:05:04,303 --> 01:05:06,903
Don't stuff yourself with all that turkey.

664
01:05:08,703 --> 01:05:10,504
See you, sleepyhead.

665
01:05:34,707 --> 01:05:38,908
Well Cash was a great guy. 
First time I ever met him...

666
01:05:39,008 --> 01:05:42,608
- Don't tell me he was in prison.
- No. He actually...

667
01:05:51,309 --> 01:05:55,510
I'm glad you called. You saved me from
a dinner of oatcakes and peanut butter.

668
01:05:55,610 --> 01:06:00,010
You always used to take me out to nice
restaurants. why don't you take yourself?

669
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:04,111
- I didn't want to go out.
- I would've brought food.

670
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,112
- It's a little tricky.
- Oh.

671
01:06:11,712 --> 01:06:14,512
- Eat some.
- Mm. Cholesterol.

672
01:06:14,547 --> 01:06:16,413
- It's fish.
- It's eggs.

673
01:06:16,513 --> 01:06:20,913
- 5000 little eggs.
- Oh, please.

674
01:06:28,514 --> 01:06:30,915
Are you seeing somebody?

675
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:34,515
Yes.

676
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,115
No.

677
01:06:37,116 --> 01:06:38,816
Is it serious?

678
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:42,716
It's hard to say. I...

679
01:06:42,816 --> 01:06:44,817
I've been really clear with her.

680
01:06:45,317 --> 01:06:47,517
Are you in love with her?

681
01:06:55,818 --> 01:06:58,119
Question of the night.

682
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:01,619
How would you like to just lie there?

683
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:08,820
- What do you mean?
- Tonight, how would you, Ray Porter,

684
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,620
like to just lie there

685
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,721
and pretend like you're in Thailand?

686
01:07:14,821 --> 01:07:19,822
And when it's all over,
I'll just slip away into the night.

687
01:07:19,857 --> 01:07:22,122
Remember?

688
01:08:01,627 --> 01:08:06,428
Hi. Whatcha doin'. Mister?
Just calling to say hello.

689
01:08:06,528 --> 01:08:09,628
When you coming down?
Let me know.

690
01:08:09,728 --> 01:08:13,129
we could have one of our nights.

691
01:08:13,229 --> 01:08:14,829
OK. So...

692
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:18,030
Have a good night. Bye.

693
01:08:36,932 --> 01:08:41,433
Dear Mirabelle. I suppose
the only way to say this is to say it.

694
01:08:44,533 --> 01:08:47,334
I slept with someone.

695
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,034
It was not romantic or intimate.

696
01:08:52,134 --> 01:08:55,435
And if I had it to do
over again. I wouldn't.

697
01:08:57,835 --> 01:09:02,036
I am not telling you this because
I want our relationship to change.

698
01:09:02,136 --> 01:09:06,436
I am telling you this only because
you deserve to know.

699
01:09:09,137 --> 01:09:11,337
I am sorry.

700
01:09:12,337 --> 01:09:14,337
Ray.

701
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:52,343
I put it in a letter because
I didn't want to change my mind

702
01:09:52,443 --> 01:09:55,143
in the middle of telling you.

703
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:13,846
I can't go to New York with you now.

704
01:10:13,946 --> 01:10:16,246
Oh, sweetie.

705
01:10:18,646 --> 01:10:20,947
I can't go.

706
01:10:22,047 --> 01:10:24,647
How could I go?

707
01:10:35,349 --> 01:10:37,349
Hey.

708
01:10:38,349 --> 01:10:41,650
You want to hear
the stupidest thing of all?

709
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,250
I somehow thought it would be all right.

710
01:11:35,757 --> 01:11:38,122
Ray. we have to cancel...

711
01:11:38,157 --> 01:11:40,158
Hey. Ray. It's Evan...

712
01:11:40,258 --> 01:11:43,158
This is a call for Mr. Porter...

713
01:12:01,461 --> 01:12:03,761
Hi, Dad.

714
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:09,962
- Hi, Mom.
- welcome.

715
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:33,765
Dinner's ready!

716
01:12:33,865 --> 01:12:36,966
I'll be there in a second!

717
01:12:43,466 --> 01:12:47,167
You getting along OK out there?

718
01:12:47,267 --> 01:12:49,132
Yeah.

719
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:52,468
Saks is fine and...
I sell a drawing sometimes.

720
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,568
Mm.

721
01:12:58,368 --> 01:13:00,869
we have a model
based on the T10-I formula.

722
01:13:00,969 --> 01:13:04,169
You can modify it when necessary
and expand it when necessary.

723
01:13:04,204 --> 01:13:06,970
The new formula is much denser,
much quicker to respond.

724
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:11,570
It can take in way more information than
the original formula, and is still containable.

725
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:16,171
Five men and five computers
can run the whole operation...

726
01:13:32,073 --> 01:13:34,473
Hello?

727
01:13:35,874 --> 01:13:38,274
Mirabelle, it's for you.

728
01:13:46,275 --> 01:13:48,175
Hello.

729
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:50,076
Hi.

730
01:13:51,876 --> 01:13:53,676
Hi.

731
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:55,976
I'm sorry.

732
01:14:02,277 --> 01:14:05,478
why don't you come to New York?

733
01:14:28,081 --> 01:14:29,681
OK.

734
01:14:30,781 --> 01:14:34,782
~ Eight weeks aren't enough still

735
01:14:35,782 --> 01:14:41,683
~ For all the other winters I've spent

736
01:14:44,183 --> 01:14:49,184
~ She lived in a house

737
01:14:50,784 --> 01:14:56,785
~ Where Mission Street bends

738
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:01,451
- Hey.
- Hey.

739
01:15:01,486 --> 01:15:05,386
- What's that?
- It's a Helmut Lang suit.

740
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:10,587
- Helmut Lang suit. What for?
- That's for when we hit New York City.

741
01:15:13,587 --> 01:15:17,188
A white suit for when
we hit New York City.

742
01:15:17,223 --> 01:15:19,188
Cool.

743
01:15:39,691 --> 01:15:41,691
You look like an angel.

744
01:15:43,491 --> 01:15:47,292
~ Sorry

745
01:15:47,392 --> 01:15:52,193
~ I can never love you tonight

746
01:15:52,293 --> 01:15:57,393
~ I could never care enough

747
01:15:57,493 --> 01:15:59,894
~ These last days

748
01:16:03,494 --> 01:16:08,495
~ Her tears fell on her pages

749
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:14,463
~ Found me well on her words

750
01:16:14,498 --> 01:16:20,396
~ I don't know what to do or say

751
01:16:20,431 --> 01:16:22,697
I'm not ready to make love.

752
01:16:23,697 --> 01:16:27,597
That's all right.
I'm just glad you're here.

753
01:16:52,101 --> 01:16:54,366
So, thank you for coming in.

754
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:56,602
we do need you
to sign a few things.

755
01:16:56,702 --> 01:16:58,702
OK. What are they?

756
01:16:58,802 --> 01:17:02,702
- Just some papers finishing off your loan.
- OK.

757
01:17:04,303 --> 01:17:07,703
What do you mean, finishing off my loan?

758
01:17:07,803 --> 01:17:11,304
What do you mean?
Your loan's been paid off.

759
01:17:13,204 --> 01:17:16,969
Just need you
to sign here and here.

760
01:17:17,004 --> 01:17:20,505
And congratulations.
It must be quite a relief.

761
01:17:21,305 --> 01:17:23,605
You are the sweetest man.

762
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:26,306
Oh, it's something
I'm able to do for you.

763
01:17:26,406 --> 01:17:30,106
- You do a lot for me.
- I don't give you very much.

764
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:33,707
Financial things, yes,
but that's easy for me.

765
01:17:34,707 --> 01:17:37,207
I know it's hard for you to be close.

766
01:17:38,207 --> 01:17:40,208
Sorry.

767
01:17:53,009 --> 01:17:55,910
- This you will love.
- That's nice.

768
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:58,410
There's one other... This one.

769
01:17:58,445 --> 01:18:00,810
It's made with salmon roe.

770
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:03,411
It's fabulous. It's great.

771
01:18:15,412 --> 01:18:17,513
Karen. It's Lisa.

772
01:18:17,613 --> 01:18:22,013
Did you sell one of those
flowered print dresses this week? Size two.

773
01:18:23,113 --> 01:18:26,914
Uh, yeah. Some guy came in.
Bought one for his girlfriend.

774
01:18:28,314 --> 01:18:32,515
- What was the name on the credit card?
- OK. Hang on one second.

775
01:18:34,815 --> 01:18:36,215
Ray Porter?

776
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,816
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Ray. I'm just about to land.

777
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:47,117
I'll be about a half-hour late.
Can I meet you at the gallery?

778
01:18:47,217 --> 01:18:48,717
OK.

779
01:18:59,419 --> 01:19:02,019
Excuse me, young lady?

780
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,620
Mirabelle.

781
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,485
It's me - Jeremy.

782
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:15,221
- Nice to see you again.
- Hi!

783
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:18,921
- You look so different.
- Yeah, I know.

784
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:21,722
Changes. Whoo!

785
01:19:24,122 --> 01:19:27,122
D'you realize I've been on the road
for a very long time now?

786
01:19:27,222 --> 01:19:31,423
- I guess you have, yeah.
- I've been trying to break into the moment.

787
01:19:32,123 --> 01:19:33,823
That's been my work.

788
01:19:33,923 --> 01:19:37,024
I don't get paid for it,
but it's my un-work work.

789
01:19:39,924 --> 01:19:43,825
I feel unprepared to see you,
but it's so nice to see you again.

790
01:19:45,525 --> 01:19:48,825
- Are you going to the Reynaldo Gallery?
- Yeah. Are you?

791
01:19:48,925 --> 01:19:50,626
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

792
01:19:50,726 --> 01:19:54,726
I'm leaving tomorrow and I wasn't sure
if I'd see the show before it closes,

793
01:19:54,761 --> 01:19:58,727
and I'm a huge fan of the artist.
He's a big influence on my stenciling.

794
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:00,627
Great.

795
01:20:00,727 --> 01:20:02,127
- Two things.
- Yes?

796
01:20:02,227 --> 01:20:03,492
- One:
- Uh-huh.

797
01:20:03,527 --> 01:20:05,328
...you look great.

798
01:20:05,428 --> 01:20:08,428
And second:
would you walk in there with me?

799
01:20:09,228 --> 01:20:10,428
- Sure.
- Yeah.

800
01:20:10,528 --> 01:20:14,529
- OK.
- Well, let's go. These are never clean.

801
01:20:14,629 --> 01:20:17,629
- You look amazing!
- Well, you look amazing.

802
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:19,730
- Are you taller?
- I'm wearing heels.

803
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,030
- Really?
- Yeah.

804
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:39,732
He's younger than I thought.

805
01:20:39,832 --> 01:20:41,833
Hm.

806
01:20:43,933 --> 01:20:46,533
- Are you going in here alone?
- I'm meeting a friend.

807
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,934
- Cool. She's?
- He's.

808
01:20:49,934 --> 01:20:52,234
He's.

809
01:20:56,535 --> 01:20:58,835
- You want something from the bar?
- Not yet.

810
01:20:58,935 --> 01:21:01,435
I'm gonna get something,
so I'll see you in a minute?

811
01:21:01,535 --> 01:21:05,936
- OK. I'll just be walking around.
- OK. Bye, Mirabelle.

812
01:21:12,537 --> 01:21:15,937
- Hi. Can I have a Mojito?
- Yes, sir.

813
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,338
Mojito.

814
01:21:23,238 --> 01:21:25,439
For you, my good man.

815
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:29,539
Oh, my God.

816
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:33,140
I have never seen
anyone else order one of these.

817
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,540
Yeah, I just love the color.

818
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,690
Good. Funny.

819
01:21:37,725 --> 01:21:39,706
- Yeah.
- wait.

820
01:21:39,741 --> 01:21:44,341
You have to take the first sip
with your eyes closed, though. Like this.

821
01:21:47,642 --> 01:21:49,742
Go ahead.

822
01:21:49,842 --> 01:21:54,543
See? Nothing to distract you
from the first taste. How was it?

823
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:57,343
It's noisy.

824
01:22:02,644 --> 01:22:04,644
I have a secret.

825
01:22:05,544 --> 01:22:08,245
- What is it?
- I know who you are.

826
01:22:09,745 --> 01:22:12,345
How do you know who I am?

827
01:22:12,445 --> 01:22:16,146
You hear about people
who are worth hearing about.

828
01:22:16,646 --> 01:22:19,646
I'm Lisa, Ray.

829
01:22:19,746 --> 01:22:22,747
Hi, Lisa Ray.

830
01:22:22,847 --> 01:22:26,447
Sense of humor.
That's good. That's good.

831
01:22:28,948 --> 01:22:30,948
You, um...

832
01:22:31,048 --> 01:22:33,348
Do you?

833
01:22:34,848 --> 01:22:36,449
What is it?

834
01:22:36,549 --> 01:22:38,649
- I can't, I can't, I'm sorry.
- What?

835
01:22:38,749 --> 01:22:41,449
- What? Just tell me.
- I can't. I'm shy.

836
01:22:41,549 --> 01:22:46,050
- Stop. I'm shy.
- OK. Do you want to get a drink later?

837
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:48,450
Yes.

838
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:51,351
Great. Um, when do you want to leave?

839
01:22:51,451 --> 01:22:53,751
Now!

840
01:22:54,951 --> 01:22:57,352
- You know what else I like?
- Hm?

841
01:22:59,452 --> 01:23:03,252
- I think I like Ray Porter.
- Hm. I can't wait to meet him.

842
01:23:07,053 --> 01:23:09,853
Bye! Hey.

843
01:23:09,953 --> 01:23:11,954
- Arrive.
- Bonsoir.

844
01:23:12,054 --> 01:23:15,254
- Sorry I'm late. want to take a walk?
- Sure.

845
01:23:17,154 --> 01:23:21,555
- I've no car. Can you give me a ride?
- Yeah, mine's in the lot.

846
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:23,955
Hey, you want to go to the Ivy?
It's still early.

847
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:26,556
Sure.

848
01:23:36,957 --> 01:23:39,357
why don't we just go home?

849
01:24:13,062 --> 01:24:15,162
OK.

850
01:24:19,063 --> 01:24:20,963
Are those handcuffs?

851
01:24:22,463 --> 01:24:25,764
- Wait and find out.
- Whoa.

852
01:24:30,464 --> 01:24:32,665
Oh, Ray.

853
01:24:36,765 --> 01:24:38,966
Oh, Ray!

854
01:24:39,966 --> 01:24:42,266
Oh, Ray!

855
01:24:42,366 --> 01:24:44,831
Oh, Ray!

856
01:24:44,866 --> 01:24:48,367
Oh, Ray! Oh, Ray!

857
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:30,173
- Well, we missed the Lakers.
- Do you care?

858
01:25:30,273 --> 01:25:32,473
I wish I did. I'd be such a guy.

859
01:25:32,573 --> 01:25:34,373
- I'm gonna get water.
- Let me get it.

860
01:25:34,473 --> 01:25:37,874
- I'll get it. You want some?
- Yes.

861
01:25:38,874 --> 01:25:41,674
- Sweetheart.
- What?

862
01:25:41,774 --> 01:25:44,075
Nothing.

863
01:25:53,076 --> 01:25:55,676
You want toast or toaster waffles?

864
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:58,877
- Toaster waffles.
- Toaster waffles.

865
01:26:11,378 --> 01:26:13,679
- Hello?
- Oh. Did I wake you?

866
01:26:13,779 --> 01:26:14,979
Hm?

867
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:18,679
- It's Jeremy.
- Who?

868
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,880
Sorry, speakerphone. It's Jeremy.

869
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:24,980
Mm. Who's Jeremy?

870
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,281
What do you mean, who's Jeremy?

871
01:26:28,381 --> 01:26:31,381
Have we met?

872
01:26:32,281 --> 01:26:38,682
Have we... It's Jeremy from last night,
you little devil. You're so funny.

873
01:26:38,782 --> 01:26:40,983
Oh, you mean we met at the gallery?

874
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:43,983
I love it when you...
Yeah, we did all those...

875
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:47,283
Remember we were doing
all those oriental positions,

876
01:26:47,383 --> 01:26:49,784
and you called me "big daddy. "

877
01:26:50,684 --> 01:26:52,884
Oh! Ray!

878
01:26:52,984 --> 01:26:55,285
Oh, Ray!

879
01:26:56,685 --> 01:26:58,785
Oh, Ray! Oh, Ray!

880
01:26:58,885 --> 01:27:01,785
Oh, Ray! Oh, Ray! Oh, Ray!

881
01:27:03,486 --> 01:27:05,086
What?

882
01:27:08,486 --> 01:27:10,687
You don't know who this is?

883
01:27:11,687 --> 01:27:16,087
Yeah, this is Ray Porter from last night.

884
01:27:18,388 --> 01:27:20,788
OK, who is Ray Porter?

885
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:26,489
Your waffle is burnt to perfection.

886
01:27:26,589 --> 01:27:28,354
- Hey, guess what?
- What?

887
01:27:28,389 --> 01:27:31,390
When I'm in New York next week,
I decided to look for an apartment.

888
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:33,990
- To move there?
- Just a place to stay while I'm there.

889
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:36,190
No more luggage! Whoo-hoo!

890
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:40,891
Like a crash pad. You lucky mister.

891
01:27:40,991 --> 01:27:46,992
Actually, I'll look for a three-bedroom
in case I meet someone and have kids.

892
01:27:58,793 --> 01:28:00,694
I'm sorry.

893
01:28:06,594 --> 01:28:08,995
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

894
01:28:10,695 --> 01:28:12,895
Ray...

895
01:28:15,696 --> 01:28:18,196
why don't you love me?

896
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:33,998
Are you just biding your time with me?

897
01:28:35,998 --> 01:28:38,499
I thought you understood.

898
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,401
So...

899
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:55,901
I can either hurt now or hurt later.

900
01:29:08,303 --> 01:29:11,003
Now, I guess.

901
01:31:05,719 --> 01:31:09,520
~ I stand there watching you

902
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:13,320
~ Hand holds a cigarette

903
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:17,021
~ She tells me her name

904
01:31:17,121 --> 01:31:20,721
~ And once again I will forget

905
01:31:20,821 --> 01:31:25,322
~ 'Cause somewhere in my heart...

906
01:31:27,322 --> 01:31:29,323
Goodbye, Mirabelle. And good luck.

907
01:31:29,423 --> 01:31:33,423
~ Somewhere in my dreams

908
01:31:33,523 --> 01:31:36,924
~ Is a love that won't stop me

909
01:31:37,424 --> 01:31:41,224
~ She drinks her coffee twice

910
01:31:41,324 --> 01:31:45,325
~ Said something I cannot hear

911
01:31:45,425 --> 01:31:49,125
~ Dark hair and brown eyes

912
01:31:49,225 --> 01:31:53,226
~ Speak that I have found what might be

913
01:31:53,326 --> 01:31:57,291
~ Somewhere in my heart

914
01:31:57,326 --> 01:32:01,227
~ There's a love that always will be

915
01:32:01,327 --> 01:32:05,227
~ Somewhere in my dreams

916
01:32:05,328 --> 01:32:09,528
~ There's a love that won't stop me

917
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:29,331
~ wish I could want someone

918
01:32:29,431 --> 01:32:33,231
~ Long enough to feel this way

919
01:32:33,331 --> 01:32:37,297
~ Can't make up your mind

920
01:32:37,332 --> 01:32:40,232
~ But it feels worse this time

921
01:32:40,332 --> 01:32:45,333
~ 'Cause somewhere in my heart

922
01:32:45,433 --> 01:32:49,234
~ Is a love that always will be

923
01:32:49,334 --> 01:32:53,334
~ Somewhere in my dreams

924
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:56,735
~ Is a love that won't stop

925
01:32:56,835 --> 01:32:59,335
So, could I borrow, like, two bucks?

926
01:32:59,435 --> 01:33:01,635
I'm just kidding.

927
01:33:01,735 --> 01:33:03,801
Here.

928
01:33:03,836 --> 01:33:06,936
Here's one of my lucky rubber bands.

929
01:33:06,971 --> 01:33:10,437
- For a rainy day.
- Thanks.

930
01:33:29,239 --> 01:33:31,439
- Thank you.
- Of course.

931
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,841
OK.

932
01:33:44,941 --> 01:33:50,242
I've been reading a lot of books on tape
about getting into the moment,

933
01:33:50,342 --> 01:33:53,708
and I think this is the moment.

934
01:33:53,743 --> 01:33:57,043
And in the moment, this moment, I...

935
01:33:57,143 --> 01:33:59,443
I think we should kiss.

936
01:33:59,543 --> 01:34:01,244
And, um...

937
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:06,144
I've stood right here before and I've been
hurt, I have been rejected by you,

938
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:09,845
and I'm going to ask you
to kiss me again.

939
01:34:10,445 --> 01:34:13,645
And, um... And...

940
01:34:16,846 --> 01:34:18,346
Will you just kiss me?

941
01:34:34,848 --> 01:34:36,949
Thank you.

942
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:41,749
- Jeremy.
- Mm?

943
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:47,150
So what made you do all this?

944
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:52,951
- All this what?
- All this... success.

945
01:34:54,751 --> 01:34:56,751
Well, you did.

946
01:34:57,151 --> 01:34:59,552
- I did?
- Mm-hm.

947
01:35:00,552 --> 01:35:02,952
How?

948
01:35:03,052 --> 01:35:08,253
Well, you said, "Just do it. "
So I did it.

949
01:35:09,853 --> 01:35:11,653
That's not very much.

950
01:35:12,153 --> 01:35:14,554
Yeah, but...

951
01:35:15,754 --> 01:35:17,754
I'll protect you.

952
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:33,256
I will.

953
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:06,926
Some nights alone.
He thinks of her.

954
01:36:06,961 --> 01:36:10,361
And some nights alone.
She thinks of him.

955
01:36:12,162 --> 01:36:15,462
Some nights these thoughts
occur at the same moment.

956
01:36:15,562 --> 01:36:20,363
And Ray and Mirabelle are connected
without ever knowing it.

957
01:36:32,965 --> 01:36:37,765
But Mirabelle. Now feeling
the warmth of her first reciprocal love.

958
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,831
Has broken away from him.

959
01:36:39,866 --> 01:36:42,466
And as Jeremy
offers her more of his heart.

960
01:36:42,566 --> 01:36:46,667
Mirabelle offers
equal parts of herself in return.

961
01:36:49,767 --> 01:36:52,467
One night.
Sooner than she would have liked.

962
01:36:52,502 --> 01:36:54,568
which made it irresistible.

963
01:36:54,668 --> 01:36:58,468
They make love
for the second time in 14 months.

964
01:36:59,568 --> 01:37:04,969
At this point. Jeremy surpasses
Ray Porter as a lover of Mirabelle.

965
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:09,270
Because what he offers her
is tender and true.

966
01:37:36,073 --> 01:37:38,374
So, tonight we'll go for Indian food.

967
01:37:38,474 --> 01:37:42,674
- I want one of those burrito...
- Yeah. A d-d-d...

968
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:45,875
- A doobie.
- Doobie?

969
01:37:45,975 --> 01:37:48,675
A dobio? What is it called?

970
01:37:59,677 --> 01:38:03,377
Um, I'm just gonna go talk to my friend.
I'll be back in a second.

971
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:04,977
OK.

972
01:38:07,078 --> 01:38:09,378
My girlfriend did these.

973
01:38:11,878 --> 01:38:14,879
- Did you get my birthday present?
- I did, yeah.

974
01:38:14,979 --> 01:38:17,679
- Did you get my thank-you note?
- Oh.

975
01:38:17,779 --> 01:38:20,480
Yes, yes. I'm sorry. Thank you.

976
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:22,580
It's OK.

977
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,980
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

978
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,381
Are you happy?

979
01:38:29,481 --> 01:38:31,281
I am.

980
01:38:31,381 --> 01:38:34,281
- The lower intensity is nice.
- Yeah.

981
01:38:35,282 --> 01:38:37,882
- Who's your girlfriend?
- She's a doctor.

982
01:38:37,982 --> 01:38:41,882
Ah. A hypochondriac no more.
She'll check you out.

983
01:38:41,983 --> 01:38:43,983
Well, she's a gynecologist.

984
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:46,683
Then you'll have a lot to discuss.

985
01:38:48,983 --> 01:38:51,584
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.

986
01:38:51,684 --> 01:38:54,284
You know, I'm always a little edgy.

987
01:38:54,384 --> 01:38:56,485
Restless.

988
01:38:56,585 --> 01:38:58,785
That's a good word.

989
01:39:02,485 --> 01:39:05,486
I want you to have
the drawing of me sleeping.

990
01:39:05,586 --> 01:39:08,286
- It's in the gallery.
- You don't have to do that.

991
01:39:08,386 --> 01:39:11,487
No, I want you to have it.

992
01:39:11,587 --> 01:39:14,387
I made it while
we were seeing each other.

993
01:39:16,387 --> 01:39:18,288
Thank you.

994
01:39:19,288 --> 01:39:22,088
And, um...

995
01:39:22,188 --> 01:39:26,289
Just so you know,
I'm sorry for the way I treated you.

996
01:39:28,889 --> 01:39:30,889
I know.

997
01:39:31,589 --> 01:39:33,890
I did love you.

998
01:39:57,993 --> 01:40:00,693
Goodbye.

999
01:40:35,198 --> 01:40:38,399
As Ray Porter watches
Mirabelle walk away.

1000
01:40:38,434 --> 01:40:40,664
He feels a loss.

1001
01:40:40,699 --> 01:40:42,999
How is it possible. He thinks.

1002
01:40:43,099 --> 01:40:45,765
To miss a woman whom he kept at a distance.

1003
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:49,800
So that when she was gone
he would not miss her?

1004
01:40:52,201 --> 01:40:56,701
Only then does he realize how wanting
part of her. And not all of her.

1005
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:58,601
Had hurt them both.

1006
01:40:58,701 --> 01:41:03,502
And how he cannot justify his actions
except that... well...

1007
01:41:04,502 --> 01:41:06,803
it was life.
