1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,747
At Cape Canaveral,
another probe into space.

2
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,615
Target: the Moon.

3
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,385
A 52-ton multistage rocket

4
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,855
combining elements of
the Thor ICBM and the Vanguard

5
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:24,524
is ready for firing.

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,527
On the planned course,
the 83-pound Pioneer space probe

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,228
would closely approach
the Moon

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,164
and would be swung into orbit
by the Moon's own gravity.

9
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,265
Two...

10
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,533
One...

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,335
Zero.

12
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,640
The vehicle roars aloft
at too steep an angle,

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,209
working more directly
against gravity than planned,

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,212
reaching over
23,000 miles an hour.

15
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,948
It carries
to nearly 80,000 miles,

16
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,250
30 times as far as ever before.

17
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,418
The Pioneer remains

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,253
man's most resoundingly
successful probe into space.

19
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,462
At last, the truth
about flying saucers.

20
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:03,563
They're real.

21
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,799
Just as real as Santa Claus,
that's what,

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,301
and we've got 10,000 Allentown
youngsters to back us up.

23
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:13,706
They greeted old St. Nick as he
made his first 1957 appearance.

24
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,408
Santa greets his greeters
with gifts and a gala party,

25
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,537
as is his custom.

26
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:20,980
A flying saucer carries

27
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,483
lots more Christmas cargo
than reindeer.

28
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,716
Where are the reindeer?

29
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,186
Why, they're back
at the North Pole, honey.

30
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,287
But don't you cry.

31
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:29,656
Santa is still Santa.

32
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,257
Christmas is still Christmas.

33
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:35,284
And kids are still kids.

34
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,968
Right up to the minute both
in transportation and in dress,

35
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,736
the first ski birds
of the season migrate

36
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:48,408
to the Bear Mountain Inn,
hopeful of snow.

37
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,677
There is no snow in New York,
but that's no never mind,

38
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,746
because the emphasis right now
is on fashions.

39
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,216
They're all dressed up for snow

40
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,218
in their White Stag ensembles
for winter sportswear,

41
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,621
colorful outfits that will
light up any festive occasion.

42
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:06,859
Hollywood, California.

43
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,496
Two titans of the movie industry
go head-to-head,

44
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:11,097
and no one wins.

45
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,733
World-famous movie star,
M. Eric McCormack,

46
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,368
known affectionately by his fans
as "Meric,"

47
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,905
has reached an impasse
in a contract dispute

48
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,508
with his long-time boss,
Louis Q. Goldstone,

49
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,610
head of Goldstone
International Pictures.

50
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,612
<i>With production complete
on Allen Trespass,</i>

51
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:30,015
rumored to be the greatest
science fiction movie ever made,

52
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,353
it appears a legal showdown
will deprive the world

53
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,820
of ever seeing it.

54
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,156
Louis Q. made the announcement

55
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,123
at his Hollywood studio
this week.

56
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,593
It saddens me deeply
to announce

57
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,596
that Goldstone International
is shelving the release

58
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:47,300
<i>of its epic sci-fi picture
Allen Trespass.</i>

59
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,002
I'm ordering today
that all prints

60
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,137
and the negative of the film
be destroyed.

61
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,628
Mr. Goldstone!
Mr. Goldstone!

62
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:57,644
Meric, seen here in a recent
interview with Edwin R. Burrows

63
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,045
days before he and Goldstone
parted ways,

64
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,550
has described the movie
as his best acting work ever.

65
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,651
Tell me about the movie.

66
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,086
I'll tell you a little,

67
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,855
because Goldy would have
my you know what.

68
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,587
And that's the news
from around the world.

69
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,757
Earlier today,
I met with Dr. Ted Lewis.

70
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,394
He's the director of the
Bald Mountain Observatory.

71
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,730
And one big gumdrop.

72
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,031
Welcome, Dr. Lewis.

73
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,934
Tonight is the height
of the meteor showers.

74
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:31,704
The Perseid meteor showers,
is that right?

75
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,904
Right.

76
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,843
Doctor, would you please tell
our audience exactly

77
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,146
what are meteors,
and where do they come from?

78
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,216
Well, they could be the debris
from comet tails,

79
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,683
like the Perseids,

80
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,918
or simply the rocks and dust
of worlds

81
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,221
that were destroyed long ago.

82
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,088
Destroyed worlds?

83
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,658
You-you mean like our Earth?

84
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,593
Well...

85
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,728
yes.

86
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,764
But don't worry; that's not
likely to happen to us

87
00:04:58,766 --> 00:04:59,865
any time soon.

88
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,435
Well, that certainly
is good news, Doctor.

89
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,427
What happens when meteorites-

90
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,071
Stardust.

91
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,613
Oh, Ted, darling, another one.

92
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:15,915
You really must see this.

93
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,783
It's breathtaking.

94
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:18,884
In a minute, dear.

95
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:21,187
It doesn't peak till
2:00 in the morning anyway.

96
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,622
Oh, Ted, another.

97
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,725
Nutmeg?

98
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,627
I'm the chef
around here tonight, remember?

99
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,862
Of course you are, darling.

100
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,197
Happy anniversary.

101
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,292
Happy anniversary, Lana.

102
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,370
Coals ready?

103
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,204
Look good.

104
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,244
Oh, Ted,
look at the big bright one.

105
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,625
Dick.

106
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,528
Dick, you promised.

107
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,896
Penny, please,
just be reasonable.

108
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,237
Now, look, we-we couldn't
possibly love each other

109
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,639
any more on our honeymoon,
could we?

110
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,942
Right?

111
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,276
Nice try, Mr. Perkins.

112
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,211
Dick, look, a shooting star.

113
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,375
Quick, make a wish.

114
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:31,290
So what was your wish?

115
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,391
Well.

116
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:36,963
What is it with you guys?

117
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,521
Whoa, Penny, what is that?

118
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,735
It's shaking around
like it's crazy.

119
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,403
Oh, gosh.

120
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,406
That's 'cause it's coming
straight at us.

121
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,740
Oh!

122
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,709
- Dick, it's gonna hit us.
- Oh, boy.

123
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,244
Hurry, Dick,
it's getting closer.

124
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,904
Come on, you piece of junk!

125
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,350
Oh, God!

126
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,889
What on earth was that?

127
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:07,223
Ted?

128
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,665
Darn, I'm trying
to reach the observatory,

129
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,766
but there's no dial tone.

130
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,535
The crash must have knocked out
the lines.

131
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:16,701
What was it, an asteroid?

132
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,904
No, dear, more like
an immense meteoroid.

133
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,906
And right in our own backyard.

134
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,141
I'm going up there.

135
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,375
Whoa.

136
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,745
Lana, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

137
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,879
It's molten iron, right?

138
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,949
Won't it be a little
too hot up there,

139
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,350
like 2,700 degrees?

140
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:38,356
Why don't you let it cool down
until morning.

141
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,459
I'll keep you plenty warm
until then.

142
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:44,629
Since when did you become
an expert on meteoroids?

143
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,730
I learned something

144
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,300
in those silly classes of yours,
remember?

145
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,860
Silly, huh?

146
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,740
Now, get out there
and check on those steaks, hmm?

147
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,245
Oh, no, Ted.

148
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,156
Merlin.

149
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,692
Hey, wake up,
you old bag of bones.

150
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,694
Do you see that?

151
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,928
That's a spaceship, old boy.

152
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,834
A real, live,
honest-to-goodness spaceship

153
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,437
from outer space, it is.

154
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,173
I knew it.

155
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,875
I knew they'd finally show up.

156
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:33,479
Yeah, I told them, the fools.

157
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,581
I knew they were gonna come.

158
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,817
I knew it.

159
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,918
Come here, boy.

160
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,855
Come here.
Come on.

161
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,620
Yeah, we got a spaceship
to get, huh?

162
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,328
Come on, come on.

163
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,321
Yeah, we're gonna be famous,
you and me.

164
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,438
There it is.

165
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,307
There it is, old boy.

166
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,977
Okay, Merlin.

167
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,714
Now, how does this sound?

168
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:18,618
Greetings, space brothers
from a distant star.

169
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,153
Welcome to our planet.

170
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,240
Ted?

171
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,540
Out here, dear.

172
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,076
Time for your present.

173
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,244
Oh, I got it, dear.

174
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,544
The binoculars are wonderful.

175
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,480
Your other present, darling.

176
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,082
Oh, my.

177
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,357
No, no, no, pinhead.

178
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,527
PPP is Proper Police Procedure.

179
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,995
PPD is an unknown DOA.

180
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,364
Well, I thought
that was a PPK.

181
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,700
No, PPK is what you do behind
a tree after you see a stiff.

182
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,701
How'd you pass the exam,
anyway,

183
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,038
promise to fix the teacher's
parking tickets?

184
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,107
Hey, easy on him, Vern,
the kid's okay.

185
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,241
Ain't that right, Bubba?

186
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,342
Huh?

187
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,610
Thank you, come again.

188
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,279
Sorry, Darlene.

189
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,283
Number five,
number two, dry and deadly.

190
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,384
Is that you, Tammy?

191
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,485
I'm sorry, Sam.

192
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,153
All right, so what is it
this time, huh?

193
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,254
Flat tire?

194
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,621
Sick aunt?
Men from Mars?

195
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:44,789
What?

196
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,658
- This has got to stop, toots.
- I'm sorry, Sam.

197
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,928
Four, five, and six
are all yours, honey pie.

198
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,192
I'm out of here, Simone.

199
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,463
Bye, boys.

200
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,741
Hey, Tammy, why don't
you and I go on up to the point?

201
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,977
Not a chance, Vernon.

202
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,812
Why not, sweetheart?

203
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,682
Because you're Vernon,
Officer Vernon.

204
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,191
Hey, Tammy, you've been here,
what, three years?

205
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,759
All that time,
I've never seen you with a guy.

206
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,894
What's your point?

207
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:23,995
Nothin'.

208
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,226
I said, what's your point,
Vernon?

209
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,878
What is the point, Lloyd?

210
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,446
Well, you know.

211
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,547
What?

212
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,881
Drop it, Bubba.

213
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,748
Right, Vern.

214
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,753
Cats, did you see that thing?

215
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,621
Wow, it blasted
right into the butte.

216
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:50,722
- It was crazy.
- See it?

217
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,892
It almost hit us
up at the point,

218
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,092
passed right over our heads.

219
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,193
It was unreal.

220
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,196
Dick, if my father finds out
we went to the point,

221
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,297
he'll go ape.

222
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,365
Don't sweat it, queenie,
my lips are zipped.

223
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,201
So what do you think it was,
Dickie?

224
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,302
Well, we couldn't tell.

225
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,071
It was-it was huge
and all covered with flames.

226
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,505
Hey, Vern's in there.

227
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,140
Maybe the egg sucker
knows something.

228
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,243
- Let's go see.
- Yeah.

229
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,945
Thank you very much.

230
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,777
You're welcome.

231
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,580
I'm gonna call in, Vern.

232
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,827
Hey, Vern, did you hear about
that big crash up on the butte?

233
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,364
It's Officer Watson to you,
cockroach.

234
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,465
You're the police.

235
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,767
You're supposed to protect us.

236
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:38,671
What if it's
a secret commie rocket?

237
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,338
Shouldn't you punks
be in school?

238
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,148
Vern, I just called in.

239
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,950
Something crashed
into the butte last night,

240
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,384
and the chief wants us
to check it out.

241
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,485
Anybody hurt?

242
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,187
That's what we're supposed
to find out.

243
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,322
Come on, let's go.

244
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,087
Whatever you say, Chief.

245
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,889
You rodents stay out of trouble.

246
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,799
Man, what a jerk that guy is.

247
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:08,900
Cool it, Dickie.

248
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,802
It's his job to suck eggs.

249
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,671
So, cats, what are we
gonna do about it?

250
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,772
Do about what?

251
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,206
The crash, the crash.

252
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,307
We got to get up there.

253
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,509
Sorry, Code, can't.

254
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,544
Freddy's Ford just got
one of them new Edsels in.

255
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:23,182
Richard, this is
the biggest thing ever

256
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,384
to hit this nowhere zilch town,
and you can't?

257
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,287
But it-it's only gonna be
there from 10:00...

258
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,221
Dickie,
Edsels will be around forever.

259
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,456
This won't.

260
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,959
Come on, man, just up there
and back, real quick.

261
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,428
I mean, what could
possibly happen?

262
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:42,634
Well, if you want to go
that bad to look that pitiful,

263
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,735
then okay.

264
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,296
Penny, you are the queen.

265
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,068
See anything?

266
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,059
Nothing but rocks.

267
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,644
Anything?

268
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,477
More rocks close up.

269
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,789
A plane crash
might still be burning, right?

270
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,657
Yeah, probably.

271
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:43,028
So would one of them rockets.

272
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,997
You got me.

273
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:46,565
Maybe it is a rocket, Vern,

274
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,901
from that test range
over in Nevada.

275
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,537
They're putting atomic bombs
on top of rockets now.

276
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,471
Wouldn't want to get near
one of those things.

277
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,705
All that radiation.

278
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,708
- No, sir.
- Radiation?

279
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,809
Yeah, I read about it.

280
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,478
It's a nasty way to go.

281
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,578
First you get real sick,

282
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,647
start puking up your guts,
and then blood.

283
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,750
Then you get hives
all over your body.

284
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,151
It's gross.

285
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,251
Little boils.

286
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,720
That's enough, Barnes.

287
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:09,922
Well, that's not all, Vern.

288
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,457
You know, your hair starts
to fall out.

289
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,592
You start bleeding
out of your nose and mouth.

290
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,926
Your skin gets all cracked and-

291
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,259
Barnes.

292
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,461
Then you die, Vern.

293
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,441
Man, oh, man.

294
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,541
Uh-oh.

295
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,644
Back up behind those trees.

296
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:36,079
Okay.

297
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,255
Cody, they're gonna see us.

298
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,087
No, they won't.

299
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,194
Let's just go home.

300
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,829
Penny.

301
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,598
You chickens go
if you want to.

302
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,433
I'm going up there.

303
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,934
Come on, Dickie.

304
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,471
This could be very, very cool.

305
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,463
Uh, we'll just
wait for you here.

306
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,075
All right, Clyde.

307
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,319
Dick, I'm scared.

308
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,088
What's wrong, Penny?

309
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,758
I don't know what it is.

310
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,461
Come here, baby.

311
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,631
Penny, there's really nothing
to be scared of.

312
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,099
Look, we're all alone.

313
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:33,769
No, we're not.

314
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,111
Whoa, hold it right there,
Officer Barnes.

315
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,445
Vern?

316
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,714
You see that glow?

317
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,518
That's a meteor for sure.

318
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,618
Got that?

319
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,621
That's how meteors glow.

320
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,990
There's no crash;
there's no bodies.

321
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,959
Case closed.
Let's get the heck out of here.

322
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,693
Uh, Vern, don't you
want to check it out?

323
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,795
No, I do not.
Let's go.

324
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,695
That's an order.

325
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,567
Dick.

326
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,008
I saw something in the trees
over there.

327
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,877
What?
I don't see anything.

328
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,513
Dick, let's just go.

329
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:16,847
Penny, Cody's still out there.

330
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,650
Dick, let's go.
Now.

331
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,484
Penny, you're just imagining-

332
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,461
What is it?

333
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,563
I don't know, Penny.

334
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,730
I don't know.

335
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,434
Oh, no.

336
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,369
Not again.

337
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,704
Penny, quick,
roll up your window

338
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,173
and lock your door.

339
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,445
Dick, it's on the roof!

340
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,996
Oh, God!

341
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,498
It's so horrible.

342
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,165
Okay, I think it's gone.

343
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,268
Yeah?

344
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,202
Let's just get out of here.

345
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,068
Penny! Penny!

346
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,173
What are you doing here,
cockroach?

347
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,076
It's a free country,
Officer Watson.

348
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,101
You little nosebleed.

349
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,013
Officer! Cody!

350
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:24,316
Yeah, kids?

351
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,884
A monster.

352
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,152
We were attacked by a monster.

353
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,252
A monster?

354
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,055
Yeah, we were in my car
up in the trees.

355
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:33,224
And it had a big eyeball,
and it tried to kill us with a...

356
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:36,028
A thing, like,
a big tentacle thing.

357
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,828
Yeah, it was real, I swear.

358
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,330
A monster, Dickie?

359
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,767
Officer Watson,
you have to believe us.

360
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,068
You know what I believe?

361
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,672
I believe your punk pranks
have gone too far this time.

362
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:47,772
What?

363
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,607
Last summer,
it was the killer with the hook.

364
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,709
The year before that...

365
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,010
Officer, please.

366
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,613
Please.

367
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,147
It's time
you learned your lesson.

368
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,449
- Get in the car.
- Officer.

369
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,550
Get in the car.

370
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,219
Hey, watch it.

371
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,711
You too, young lady.

372
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,892
Not so fast, Watson.

373
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:09,661
I know my rights.

374
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,096
Oh, I'm-I'll get in.

375
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,189
I'm in. I'm in.

376
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,137
I'll haul these punks in;
you drive their car.

377
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,239
Okay, Vern.

378
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,606
Thanks a lot, Code.

379
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,166
Just there and back, right?

380
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,976
Really hate that guy.

381
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,470
Ted, is that you?

382
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:52,570
No.

383
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:55,406
Not a note, nothing?

384
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,907
Look at you.

385
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,243
You are Lana.

386
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,345
And you are a mess.

387
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,646
You are Ted's mate.

388
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,883
Of course I am.

389
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,018
Ted loves Lana.

390
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,113
And Lana loves Ted.

391
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,026
Hormonal polarity.

392
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,863
Yes, I have heard of
this phenomenon.

393
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,131
Odd sensation.

394
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,969
Call it what you will, dear.

395
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,105
Last night was wonderful.

396
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,307
Now, go clean up, get dressed,
and come to breakfast.

397
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,409
You are Lana.

398
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,509
You must assist me.

399
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,275
Really, Ted,
you can dress yourself.

400
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,852
Men.

401
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,788
And if you must go off
chasing your meteors

402
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,490
in the middle of the night,
next time you tell me.

403
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,959
I was worried half to death.

404
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:02,240
Ted, what is this?

405
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,808
Pocket-sized binoculars?

406
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,910
No.

407
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:08,880
Oh, Ted,
I know how to be careful.

408
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,972
Oh, you scientists.

409
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:12,784
Go sit down.

410
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,912
Breakfast is ready.

411
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,568
Ted I'm going to tell you
something Mother said.

412
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,203
She said,
"It can happen in a marriage.

413
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,405
"One morning you just wake up,

414
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,974
and there's a stranger sitting
across from you".

415
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,137
I told her
it was utter nonsense.

416
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,439
Now I'm not so sure.

417
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,323
Oh, Ted, are you all right?

418
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,625
What is this?

419
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,125
Oh, no.

420
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,228
Oh, dear.

421
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:57,328
Ted, you stay right there.

422
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,262
I'm gonna call Dr. Miller.

423
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,136
Darn it, the line is still out.

424
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,641
Ted, you must go lie down.

425
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:10,741
What is this called?

426
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,443
Salt.
It's called salt.

427
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,545
Salt.

428
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,279
This will harm the Ghota.

429
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,681
You are Lana.
You must assist me.

430
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,250
Oh, Ted, stop it.
You're scaring me.

431
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,151
Ted wants you safe.

432
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,955
How was breakfast, Chief?

433
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,191
Oh, same old slop.

434
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,291
Anything up?

435
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,561
Old man Wilson called again,
screaming about his space man.

436
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:31,663
Was he drunk?

437
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:32,864
Of course.

438
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,165
And the typewriter
needs a new ribbon.

439
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,167
Paperwork, Stiles,
get used to it.

440
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,269
Better you than me.

441
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,171
In two days, I'm retired.

442
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:43,474
Case closed,
as Officer Watson likes to say.

443
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:45,809
Ha.

444
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,580
Vern brought in some kids.

445
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:51,348
Uh-huh.

446
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,984
Making a false report
to the police,

447
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:59,057
that's a very serious charge,
Mr. Perkins.

448
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,459
We were attacked,
Chief Dawson.

449
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,861
We got attacked by a monster.

450
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,796
Mm-hmm.

451
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,097
That's what it says right here,
all right,

452
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,199
"attacked by a monster".

453
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,436
It looked like a big eyeball
with a long tentacle thing.

454
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,306
- Right.
- It tried to kill us.

455
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:15,906
You have to believe me.

456
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,442
I've never been so scared.

457
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,044
I'm going to notify
your parents.

458
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,679
No, please don't.

459
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,204
Just give us a break,
will you?

460
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,018
If I ever see any of you
in my office again,

461
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,453
you'll all need lawyers.

462
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,022
- You dig me, Mr. O'Hara?
- Mm-hmm.

463
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,425
Get out of here
before I change my mind.

464
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,534
Ah.

465
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,435
Yeah, okay, Merlin.

466
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,201
Yeah, okay, you old hound.

467
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,376
Come on.
Come on.

468
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,945
Away you go.
Away you go.

469
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,881
Don't be gone long,
you old goat.

470
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,357
Sorry about last night,
space brothers.

471
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,759
Just a little bird shot.

472
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,830
No harm done, right?

473
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:15,599
I'll take you
to our leader today.

474
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,134
I promise.

475
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,604
I will.

476
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,788
Ted, darling,
what are you doing?

477
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,356
Salt.

478
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,458
It's-it's under there.

479
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,586
You know that.

480
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,601
Why don't you go lie down?

481
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:50,701
Salt will protect Lana.

482
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:51,802
You will assist me.

483
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:52,971
Of course I'll assist you.

484
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,239
- I'll take care of you.
- Good.

485
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,339
We must go.

486
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,574
You will drive.

487
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:57,942
Yes, of course I'll drive.

488
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,211
Um, we'll go see Dr. Miller.

489
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,578
It's Saturday, but-

490
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,147
No doctor;
the Ghota.

491
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,315
The Ghota?

492
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,050
What Ghota?

493
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,519
You need to see Dr. Miller.

494
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,386
I must find the Ghota
before it divides.

495
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,755
You need to see the doctor.

496
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,089
Ted wants you safe.

497
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,625
Stop saying that.

498
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,726
I am safe.

499
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:15,894
Ted is not safe.

500
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,729
No.

501
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,997
Ted is safe.

502
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:20,964
I'm going to get Dr. Miller.

503
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,762
You will not assist me?

504
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,305
Lana.

505
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,641
Lana.

506
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,980
Lana?

507
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,631
Oh, hey, toots, do me a favor.

508
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,567
Run out to the Gunderson farm
and pick me up three dozen eggs.

509
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,037
You got time to get out there
and back before the lunch crowd.

510
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:00,596
Sure, Sam.

511
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,468
Dr. Lewis.

512
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,935
Hello?

513
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:39,978
You are Tammy.

514
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:41,311
Gosh, Dr. Lewis,

515
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,314
I didn't think
you remembered me.

516
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,816
Ted remembers you.

517
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,550
Um, uh, where are you going?

518
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,051
That way.

519
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,154
To the butte?

520
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,823
Can I give you a lift?

521
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,892
I'm headed that way myself.

522
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:55,160
You were going that way.

523
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,961
Oh.

524
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,230
Well, a girl can change
her mind, can't she?

525
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,633
Yes.

526
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:04,567
Minds can be changed.

527
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,105
Is something wrong?

528
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,273
Oh, gosh.

529
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,708
Gosh, I'm sorry.

530
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,143
I know you're married.

531
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,310
Yes.

532
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,813
Lana is Ted's wife.

533
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,780
Please, I don't mean
anything by it.

534
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:20,417
I was just trying to be...

535
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,519
helpful.

536
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,619
You will assist me?

537
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,454
I'd be happy to, Dr. Lewis.

538
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,583
Good.

539
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:32,054
Ah, well, all right then.

540
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,602
Um, Dr. Lewis, can I-

541
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:38,702
can I call you Ted?

542
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,672
My name is Urp.

543
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:41,972
Do you want some Rolaids?

544
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,173
I've got some in my purse.

545
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,910
Dr. Lewis.

546
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,010
Can I-Ted.

547
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,480
Can I ask you
a personal question?

548
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,815
Yes.

549
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,384
At night, when you're
looking through a telescope,

550
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,385
do you ever wonder
what's out there?

551
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,088
I mean, what's really out there.

552
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,490
I know
what is really out there.

553
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,925
I suppose you do.

554
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,328
But I'm talking about
other worlds

555
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,731
and civilizations and things.

556
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,534
It gives me shivers
just to think about it.

557
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:13,637
I get shivers
on Toolamane Four.

558
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,739
What's that?

559
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,441
It is one of seven ice planets

560
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,343
that orbit
the neutron star Tryxl.

561
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:19,743
Ice planets?

562
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,512
You can see other planets, wow.

563
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,016
I never knew
you astronomers could do that.

564
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,416
I have been to many planets.

565
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,419
My home planet is Koddhar.

566
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,011
It is in the Draco cluster.

567
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,557
Right.

568
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,231
What is that thing?

569
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,234
It is a biogenic
phase disruptor.

570
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,470
A what?

571
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,771
Is that, like, some kind of gun
or something?

572
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:48,873
Yes.

573
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:51,409
I hope you don't hunt with it.

574
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,310
You don't hunt with it, do you?

575
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,811
Yes.

576
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:58,682
Well, my gosh, I never thought
you'd be the type, Dr. Lewis.

577
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,884
The stores are full of meat.

578
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,252
You don't have to go around
killing defenseless animals.

579
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,388
The Ghota is not defenseless.

580
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,223
Goats.
You're hunting goats.

581
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,325
Ghota, not goats.

582
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,527
Ghota, goats,
whatever you say, I don't care.

583
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:10,662
It's cruel.

584
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:13,397
It is necessary.

585
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,099
In several of your hours,
the Ghota will divide.

586
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,902
If it is not stopped
before that,

587
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:20,171
it will feed
and then multiply exponentially

588
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,906
until Ghotas consume all life
on this planet.

589
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,075
And you're here to stop it.

590
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:25,809
Yes.

591
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,012
I would be called
a federal marshal in your world.

592
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,141
I enforce security
in this quadrant.

593
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,856
Deals, deals, deals!

594
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,226
Come on down today
to Freddy's Ford!

595
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:44,461
Freddy's Ford, where we-

596
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,131
Friends, do you have
tired blood?

597
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,432
Hey, Lloyd, leave it on.

598
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,534
What for?

599
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:50,634
It's all trash.

600
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,736
I want to hear it.

601
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,371
I think maybe I got tired blood.

602
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:54,972
No, you've got lazy blood,
Bubba.

603
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,074
There's a difference.

604
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:59,309
If you have
that rundown feeling...

605
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,311
Hey, Lloyd, I think maybe

606
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,413
I got that rundown feeling
all the-

607
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,515
Ow.

608
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,416
If you so much
as touch that radio again,

609
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,118
I'm gonna throw you
in front of the truck,

610
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,355
and you're gonna have
a run-over feeling, you hear me?

611
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,153
- Lloyd.
- "Lloyd".

612
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,363
Damn, Lloyd.

613
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:19,463
What was that thing?

614
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,565
I don't know.

615
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:23,000
I... I don't know.

616
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,196
Where'd it go?

617
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,440
Sure was ugly.

618
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,384
What was that?

619
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,486
I... I don't know.

620
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:45,183
Let's get back to town.

621
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,167
Well, my truck broke down

622
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,369
right here
in beautiful bustling Mojave,

623
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,739
and I've been stuck here
ever since.

624
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,240
I finally got
a little money saved,

625
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,809
and someday,
I'll move to Sausalito.

626
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,111
It's a very hip town,
you know.

627
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:08,646
There are a lot of artists
out there.

628
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:12,349
And maybe I'll open
an art gallery.

629
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:15,717
Gee, I sure can blabber on.

630
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,755
You haven't heard a word
I've said, have you?

631
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,190
Yes, I have.

632
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,893
Your last sentence was,
"Gee, I sure can blabber on".

633
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,597
Yeah.

634
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,565
It's all
wishful thinking anyway,

635
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,900
some pipe dream.

636
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,068
No.

637
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,737
You will move to Sausalito.

638
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,971
You will make art.

639
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,273
You will open an art gallery.

640
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:37,875
Really?

641
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,400
Now, how do you know all this,
pray tell?

642
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,679
Because I do.

643
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,219
Whoa.

644
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,121
Let's change the subject, okay?

645
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,824
Tell me more about your Ghotas.

646
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,193
Do they have three eyes
and six horns?

647
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,463
No.

648
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,197
They are unicellular amphipods

649
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,365
with a nucleolytic
subdermal membrane

650
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,802
and capable of complete
chromodynamic distortion.

651
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:05,902
What does all that mean?

652
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,271
Ghotas can
make themselves invisible.

653
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,639
Invisible.
Cool.

654
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,041
Ghotas are not cool.

655
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:15,646
Their metabolic temperature
is 155 of your degrees.

656
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:20,016
Ghotas are an aggressive,
intelligent, and clever species.

657
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:22,652
This one disabled the plasma
injectors on my spacecraft.

658
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,422
I was forced to land
on your planet.

659
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,623
The Ghota escaped.

660
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,291
So Ghotas can, uh, think?

661
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,260
Yes.

662
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,898
Stop.

663
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,389
Stop here.

664
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:38,702
What?

665
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:39,804
Did you see something?

666
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,373
No, I sensed it,
over there by that dwelling.

667
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,474
We get out here.

668
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,576
We?

669
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:46,811
You must come with me.

670
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,945
Ted wants you safe.

671
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,380
That's sweet of Ted.

672
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,577
I want Tammy safe too.

673
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,253
Come.

674
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:11,559
Stay behind me,
close.

675
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:22,112
Um, Dr. Lewis, I really don't
think we should be here.

676
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:24,514
Stop.
Don't move.

677
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:28,518
This is not good.

678
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,255
What is not good?

679
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,356
It's only a puddle.

680
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,125
Somebody spilled something,
that's all.

681
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:36,827
Yes, a puddle.

682
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,762
So why is a puddle not good?

683
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,398
The Ghota has eaten.

684
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,132
It absorbs its prey's nutrients,

685
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:44,268
leaving only water
and metabolic residue.

686
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,835
What?

687
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,237
Humans are mostly water.

688
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,639
Humans?

689
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,739
That's a person?

690
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,840
It was a person.

691
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:51,943
Oh, look at it.

692
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,043
That is a mud puddle.

693
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:55,545
It's not a person.

694
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,114
Dr. Lewis, Ted,

695
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,682
aren't you carrying
this Ghota thing

696
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,016
a little bit too far?

697
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,284
I mean, you're very creative,

698
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,186
and I think it's great
that you're rounding up

699
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,487
all the bad killer space goats.

700
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:05,590
Quiet.
Stay behind me.

701
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,157
Oh, this is absurd.
What for?

702
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,659
Ted wants you safe.

703
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,360
Oh, would you please
not talk like that?

704
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:13,331
It is beginning to bug me.

705
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,900
I think I've had enough
of this silly, stupid game.

706
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,001
You are safe with me.

707
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:20,197
You keep away.

708
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,068
Pull over.

709
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,304
I got to take a whiz.

710
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,572
Can't you wait
until we get to town?

711
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,673
No, I can't.

712
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:59,342
Now, please pull over there
by those trees.

713
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:03,746
Oh, you're like a child,
Bubba.

714
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,159
Now, what was that?

715
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:17,728
Don't go too far, Bubba.

716
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,864
You're too drunk
to find your way back.

717
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,532
Don't worry about it, Lloyd.

718
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,701
I can handle it, I think.

719
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,108
Bubba?

720
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,307
Are you getting sick, Bubba?

721
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,650
What's this mess you left here?

722
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,632
Bubba?

723
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,244
Boom! Zap!

724
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:09,480
Tommy, cut that out.

725
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,282
Zap! You're dead, you creep.

726
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,750
Oh, Mrs. Lewis.

727
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,117
Hi, is Dr. Miller in?

728
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,052
- No, he's...
- Laura we've got to go.

729
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,153
We'll be late.

730
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,521
How many times
have I told you?

731
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,257
We're not going to the movie.

732
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,259
- Well, when will he be back?
- It's not fair.

733
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,862
Well, that's the price
of being a creep.

734
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,797
He's seen enough
of that science fiction junk.

735
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:27,898
It gives him nightmares.

736
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,300
Laura, really, it's important.

737
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,400
When will Dr. Miller be back?

738
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:31,702
Oh, it won't be until late.

739
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,170
He's gone off to Barstow.

740
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,739
Barstow?

741
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,840
Will you tell him-

742
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,576
Laura, you really bite.

743
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:39,677
What?

744
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,166
Kid, you're hamburger.

745
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:47,251
A monster is a pretty hard
thing to swallow, Dickie.

746
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,121
You know, fine, Cody,
don't believe me.

747
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,057
When the heck
you gonna grow up, Code?

748
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,925
The monster did it, Dickie.

749
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:00,030
Dig this, cats.

750
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,300
Suppose your monster is real.

751
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,101
- It is real.
- Okay, okay.

752
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,670
So it's real.

753
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,606
My old man just got one of them
new Polaroid cameras,

754
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,541
you know, like,
instant pictures.

755
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:12,742
We go up there,

756
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,778
snap off a few shots
of your monster,

757
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,181
sell 'em to the newspapers,
and get rich, rich, rich.

758
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,282
It almost killed us.

759
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,784
So this time
we'll be ready for it.

760
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,119
With what,
a paranoid camera?

761
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,688
It's a Polaroid, man,
Polaroid.

762
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,425
So what's it gonna be, Dickie?

763
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,159
This is our big chance.

764
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:30,958
Don't blow it, Clyde.

765
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:35,356
I think it's the only way
we can prove what happened.

766
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,235
I don't believe this.

767
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,521
There's nothing here now.

768
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,291
Looks like your monster split.

769
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,092
Good.
Let's go home.

770
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:06,664
Hey, I bet the crash
and the monster are connected.

771
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:07,764
Yeah.

772
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,733
- Come on, let's go up there.
- No, let's go home.

773
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:10,835
You're nuts, Cody.

774
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,001
That's way too far to climb.

775
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,103
Too far?
Please, Dickie.

776
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,905
Cody, if Dawson ever finds out
about this...

777
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:17,007
Don't sweat it, pal.

778
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,601
We'll be fine.

779
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,990
Wow.

780
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,793
What is it,
a rocket?

781
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:36,893
Yeah.

782
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:37,994
No.
Maybe.

783
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,699
I don't know.

784
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,135
But I do know
we're gonna be rich, Dickie.

785
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,336
Oh, yeah.
Come on, let's go.

786
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,204
Cody, wait.

787
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:49,606
It could be radioactive.

788
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:50,740
Oh, you think?

789
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,842
You got your picture.

790
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,012
Let's just split
while we still can, okay?

791
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,081
Yeah, right.

792
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,949
Come on.

793
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,791
You're being a brat.

794
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,159
I said I don't want
to go home.

795
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,295
Tommy, we're going home,
and that's it.

796
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:15,599
No, I want to go
back to the town.

797
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,931
No.

798
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:23,266
Please.

799
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:30,114
You stink.

800
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,447
Just keep it up, brat,

801
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,384
and you won't be able
to sit for a week.

802
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,818
My dad is going to fire you.

803
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,755
Oh, this time, Tommy,
you are cooked.

804
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:39,856
Now, go to your room.

805
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:40,958
No.

806
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:44,621
You are really cruisin'
for a bruisin', kiddo.

807
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:34,311
Laura!

808
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,512
What is it now, Tommy?

809
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,481
Laura!

810
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,284
What are you doing
out of your room?

811
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,052
Do you want me to check
for monsters again?

812
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,554
- It's up there.
- You little creep.

813
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,088
You see all
those horrible movies,

814
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,590
and now you're
scared of monsters.

815
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,925
The monster is up in the hall.

816
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,416
Laura, it's true.

817
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,733
It's true.
I saw it on TV last week.

818
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:58,135
The guy even had pictures.

819
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:02,139
I still say it's a secret jet
the air force have.

820
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,574
Chief, jets don't fly
like that.

821
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,842
Jerking around
and then suddenly zipping away?

822
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:07,478
I'll jerk some sense
into both of you.

823
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,911
What we saw out there
on the butte,

824
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:11,014
that was a meteor,
common garden-variety meteor.

825
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:12,115
Case closed.

826
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,452
Mojave police, Chief Dawson.

827
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,356
Uh-huh.

828
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,291
All right, we'll ask
around our neighborhood.

829
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,527
Call me if you learn anything.

830
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,028
Strange.

831
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,130
Chief?

832
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,764
That was Stiles.

833
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:31,034
He found Lloyd Olson's truck
abandoned.

834
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:32,702
No sign of him or Bubba.

835
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,804
Said the doors were both open,

836
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:37,407
and the key
was still in the ignition.

837
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:39,376
Only thing around
was a couple of big puddles.

838
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,277
That's odd.
It hasn't rained in months.

839
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,684
Mojave police, Chief Dawson.

840
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:49,485
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

841
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:51,588
Who is this?

842
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,791
Uh-huh, Laura McBride.

843
00:44:54,793 --> 00:44:57,360
What can I do for you,
Miss McBride?

844
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,128
A monster?

845
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,697
With a giant eyeball.

846
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:03,199
Look, we're kind of busy here,
Miss McBride.

847
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,568
All right.

848
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:05,869
Doc Miller's house.

849
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,670
All right,
we'll-we'll send someone out.

850
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:10,606
Yes, yes, yes, of course,
right away.

851
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,512
Laura McBride is having
an emergency,

852
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,748
a giant monster, she said.

853
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:21,284
Laura is Susie McBride's
kid sister, isn't she?

854
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:22,985
Mm-hmm.

855
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,556
That's-

856
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,356
That's one classy chassis.

857
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,893
Watson, you're going out
on a call, not a date.

858
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,929
Take Stu.

859
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,030
I don't need a chaperone.

860
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,731
For backup.

861
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,632
I don't like
what's going on today.

862
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,344
Hello.

863
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,612
I'm Officer Vernon Watson.

864
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,748
What seems to be the problem?

865
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,382
There's a monster
in the house.

866
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:53,983
Really?
A big one?

867
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:55,085
I don't know what it is.

868
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,286
I've never been so scared.

869
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:59,056
Hey, aren't you
Susie McBride's kid sister?

870
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,657
What?

871
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,860
There's something horrible
inside there.

872
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,260
Do something.

873
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,461
How's Susie doing?

874
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:08,590
She still hanging out
with that insurance jerk?

875
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:42,532
There's a big old hairy monster!

876
00:46:42,534 --> 00:46:45,092
Oh!

877
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,362
Vern, you okay?

878
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:12,054
Vernon?

879
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,561
Vernon?

880
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,759
Vernon, this better not
be a joke.

881
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,206
Vernon?

882
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,844
Vernon.

883
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:52,628
Hey.

884
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,896
Hey, you!

885
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,431
Is that you, Dr. Lewis?

886
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,101
What are you doing?

887
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:02,905
Hey!

888
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:04,440
Hey!

889
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,476
Hey!

890
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:14,483
Oh, he just walked in.

891
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,152
I'll tell him.

892
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,155
Good news only, Stiles.

893
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,489
Sorry, Chief.

894
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,923
Ted Lewis stole a car.

895
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:22,159
This is the license.

896
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,592
Dr. Lewis
from the observatory?

897
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:24,994
Very one.

898
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:26,630
Lewis, huh?

899
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,331
See, you never know.

900
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,500
These eggheads, they seem
like they're one step away

901
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,902
from the rubber room anyway.

902
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,405
- Bring him in.
- 10-4, Chief.

903
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:39,710
Unit two, unit two.

904
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,811
Go ahead, unit two.

905
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,012
Chief, we have a PDX.

906
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,114
We have a PDX here.

907
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,083
A PDX, Officer Barnes?

908
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,184
Get it right.

909
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,418
A PDX.
Vern's down.

910
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,519
He's down?

911
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:53,123
Yeah, he was there,
and then there was nothing,

912
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,818
just... just a puddle.

913
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:57,027
Puddle?

914
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,228
Yeah, with his gun
and badge in it.

915
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,923
What should I do now, Chief?

916
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,492
Chief?

917
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,422
Chief?

918
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:38,735
Sorry about Vernon, Chief.

919
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,103
He was a first-rate officer.

920
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,338
Yeah.

921
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,806
Chief, what could have
done this?

922
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,242
Folks are saying
it must be acid,

923
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,411
a psycho killer with acid.

924
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:48,512
What else could it be?

925
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:54,483
Mojave police.
Dawson here.

926
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:56,353
Are you sure?

927
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:57,554
All right, all right.

928
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,250
Call me if you
see anything else.

929
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:02,458
That was Ed Sanders.

930
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,226
He spotted Lewis
on his property,

931
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,596
said the boob drove
all over a stop sign.

932
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:09,833
Oh, Sanders thinks Lewis
has some kind of weapon.

933
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,168
You think it fires acid?

934
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:14,503
Really, Barnes.

935
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,706
Knew I should have never
taken this job.

936
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:17,807
What?

937
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:20,342
Town needed a temporary chief
for three weeks

938
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:23,213
until they found a real cop.

939
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,248
I thought being
a dogface in the war

940
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,916
was enough qualification for me.

941
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,018
"Don't worry," they said.

942
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,887
"Nothing ever happens here,"
they said.

943
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:34,891
And for five years, nothing did.

944
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:39,329
And then two days before my
replacement finally takes over,

945
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:43,467
and suddenly we have monsters
and killers

946
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:46,458
and men from Mars
and God knows what else!

947
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:54,635
Just two lousy, stinkin' days.

948
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,219
Where you going, Chief?

949
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:05,018
Guess it's time to play cop.

950
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:13,829
I'll stay here.

951
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,331
Mommy!

952
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:18,268
Mommy!

953
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:21,103
Betsy, what is it now?

954
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:22,873
Mommy, there's bears out here.

955
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:23,974
They're trying to eat me.

956
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,943
Remember what happened to
the little boy who cried wolf?

957
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,043
But it wasn't a wolf.

958
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:30,068
It was a bear.

959
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,561
What'll it be, guys?

960
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,262
- Coke.
- Coke.

961
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:47,463
I'll have an RC Cola.

962
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:49,099
Very funny, Cody.

963
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:51,668
Okay, three Cokes.

964
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,769
Well, you're sure
full of yourself today, mister.

965
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:55,271
You betcha.

966
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:56,972
We're gonna be rich, Tammy.

967
00:52:56,974 --> 00:53:00,710
We got a picture
of a genuine spaceship.

968
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,811
A spaceship?

969
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,813
Yeah, that crashed up
on the butte last night.

970
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,782
Got a picture of it right here.

971
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:08,117
Whoa, be careful with that.

972
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:09,385
It's worth a million bucks.

973
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:10,719
Not as good as a monster, but-

974
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:12,556
A monster?

975
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:13,657
A monster, Tammy.

976
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,525
We were attacked
by a monster this morning,

977
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,726
only no one will believe us.

978
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:21,063
Wh... what did this monster
look like?

979
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:23,567
Well, it was... it was
like a big, shimmering,

980
00:53:23,568 --> 00:53:25,735
shiny balloon thing
with a big eyeball.

981
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:26,835
Yeah, it was weird.

982
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,371
It was there one minute
and then gone

983
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,306
like it could just
become invisible.

984
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,474
Oh, my God.

985
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:34,978
Tammy, do you believe us?

986
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,275
Cheese it.
It's the cops.

987
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:47,056
Tammy, coffee.

988
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,291
Chief Dawson, there's
something I have to tell you.

989
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:50,393
Later, Tammy.

990
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,494
Chief, please.

991
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,128
Not now, Tammy.

992
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,164
Tammy, more coffee.

993
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,034
Hey, Dawson, whatever happened
to Vern Watson?

994
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,936
I heard he got melted by acid.

995
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,838
Yeah, and I hear
Lloyd and Bubba are missing.

996
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,039
And what's this talk
about a monster?

997
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:05,507
A monster, Fred?

998
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:06,876
Get real.

999
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,112
It's a schizophrenic,
manic-depressive psychotic.

1000
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,847
I read all about these sickos.

1001
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,650
<i>I didn't know you could read.</i>

1002
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,085
Look, people.

1003
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,221
Listen to me,
there are no psycho killers,

1004
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:20,090
no monsters.

1005
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,458
All we got is a couple
of unsolved disappearances,

1006
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,592
that's all.

1007
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,094
That's all?

1008
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:26,295
Phew!

1009
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:28,931
Well, that-that's a relief.

1010
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,534
Look, just...
just stick together.

1011
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:33,637
Stay in your homes.

1012
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,639
You see anything unusual,
you report it.

1013
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:38,474
And trust me,
there's no cause for alarm.

1014
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:41,311
Well, it sounds like there's
plenty cause for alarm, Dawson.

1015
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,903
People, please.

1016
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:47,713
Darlene, number five,
number two, hot and sweaty.

1017
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,019
Great speech, Dawson.

1018
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:51,121
I feel so much better now.

1019
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,688
Give 'em to Tammy, Simone.

1020
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,922
My shift's over.

1021
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,324
Tammy, get your buns
over here.

1022
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:57,827
Chief, please listen to me.

1023
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,130
I know this will sound crazy,
but you have to listen to me.

1024
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,065
Well, crazy's the word
for the day.

1025
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,599
All right, go ahead, Tammy.

1026
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:06,802
Chief, the killer is some kind
of alien creature.

1027
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,538
It's called a Ghota.

1028
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:09,739
It came from the spaceship,

1029
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,074
you know, that crash
on the butte.

1030
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,509
Chief Dawson, please,

1031
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,610
this is
a very dangerous creature.

1032
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:16,045
It can think.
It can hunt.

1033
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:17,146
It's a born killer.

1034
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,648
Mm-hmm.

1035
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,617
All it leaves behind
is a puddle...

1036
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:23,119
the victim's water.

1037
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,653
How'd you know about that?

1038
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:25,755
I've seen it.

1039
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,023
You've seen this thing?

1040
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,224
Well, no, no, not exactly.

1041
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:30,360
Dr. Lewis told me about it.

1042
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,829
Well, Lewis has gone bananas.

1043
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,664
Actually, Dr. Lewis
is a marshal,

1044
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,701
a federal marshal
from another...

1045
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:39,463
planet.

1046
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:42,871
Another planet.

1047
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:43,972
Ah, dang!

1048
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:46,876
Chief.
Chief?

1049
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:47,976
You're nuts.

1050
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:49,079
Lewis is nuts!

1051
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:52,715
This whole town,
you're all stark raving loco!

1052
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:10,523
I want to know
what's going on.

1053
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:15,938
Oh!

1054
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,340
Sorry.

1055
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,440
Sorry.

1056
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:19,943
Let's go, Henry.

1057
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:23,344
We're safer outside
with the acid killer.

1058
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,952
Oh, no, Sam.

1059
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,052
Where's the bag?

1060
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:31,221
It's busted.

1061
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:33,489
- There's a new one on order.
- Great.

1062
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,157
Hey, toots, would you
run up the street

1063
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:36,559
and pick me up some lard,
please?

1064
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,659
The cheap stuff.

1065
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:38,994
I'll mind the store.

1066
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,429
Great.

1067
00:56:45,302 --> 00:56:46,603
Merlin.

1068
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:47,903
Come here, boy.

1069
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,739
Come here.

1070
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,041
Where's Wilson?

1071
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,376
Merlin, what's-what's wrong?

1072
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,338
Merlin, it's all right.

1073
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,483
Cody.

1074
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:02,952
Code, you hear about Vern?

1075
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:04,586
Yeah, I heard.

1076
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:08,056
Jeez, Code,
your archenemy's missing.

1077
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,159
We figured you'd be kicking
your heels up with joy.

1078
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:12,362
He sucked his last egg, right?

1079
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,663
Yeah, I guess.

1080
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:15,164
Hey, why don't we go
to the flicks?

1081
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,465
Yeah, it's just what you need.

1082
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:17,766
No, you cats go ahead.

1083
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,963
- Ah, come on, Code,
my treat.

1084
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,739
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1085
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,141
Okay, why not?

1086
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:27,342
Come on.

1087
00:57:27,344 --> 00:57:28,610
Mommy!

1088
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,137
Mommy!

1089
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,117
What is it now, Betsy?

1090
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,786
There's a monster
with one big eye.

1091
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,688
I told you before
to stop making up stories.

1092
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,856
Now, see what you've done?

1093
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:42,525
You've gone
and scared yourself silly.

1094
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,327
There's a monster.

1095
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:48,398
There are no monsters.

1096
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,365
You get inside now.

1097
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:51,467
Mommy.

1098
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:30,507
What's with you, Tammy?

1099
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,775
You've been like that all day.

1100
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,443
Just-just keep your mind
on your work.

1101
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:35,744
Sorry, Sam.

1102
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:36,980
Come on.

1103
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:40,210
This killer thing's
getting to you, huh, toots?

1104
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,686
Well, I think we can forget
about any dinner crowd

1105
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,454
in here tonight.

1106
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:47,923
All right, I'm going.

1107
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:50,260
Sweep up the sidewalk

1108
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,059
and straighten up in here
before you leave, will you?

1109
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,219
Stop right there, Dr. Lewis.

1110
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,686
You are Stiles.

1111
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:18,788
You are a constable.

1112
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:19,889
You must assist me.

1113
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:23,847
Yeah, sure, that's exactly
why I'm here, Dr. Lewis.

1114
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,460
Is that a weapon, sir?

1115
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:27,329
Yes.

1116
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:31,199
All right, Dr. Lewis, just...
just hand me the gun, sir.

1117
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:32,635
Why?

1118
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,170
Because I'm asking you to.

1119
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,606
I don't want any-
I don't want any trouble here.

1120
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,407
Just hand it over nice and slow.

1121
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,239
No.

1122
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,880
Now, look here, Dr. Lewis.

1123
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,282
Officer Stiles.

1124
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,382
Dr. Lewis.

1125
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:48,483
What's going on?

1126
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:49,585
Get back inside, Tammy.

1127
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,721
Tammy, the Ghota is near.

1128
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:53,289
I must find it
before it divides.

1129
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:54,389
Ghota?

1130
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:55,490
The monster.

1131
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:56,592
We'll be overrun.

1132
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:57,693
We'll all be killed.

1133
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:59,429
Monster?
What are you talking about?

1134
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,230
Tell him.

1135
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:03,465
Your planet will
soon be infected with Ghotas.

1136
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:05,568
They will consume
all organic matter

1137
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:08,003
until your world
is devoid of life.

1138
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:10,172
Before it divides,
its hunger is massive.

1139
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,275
It will seek the greatest
concentration of prey.

1140
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,643
You are all in extreme peril.

1141
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:14,744
This is crazy.

1142
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:15,978
This is crazy, Dr. Lewis.

1143
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,179
Give me the weapon right now.

1144
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:19,114
No, Stiles, please,
you have to believe him.

1145
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,882
Now, look here, Dr. Lewis.

1146
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:22,418
I've been on this force
for 15 years,

1147
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:24,454
and I've never used
this gun yet.

1148
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,855
Don't let this be
the first time.

1149
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:27,456
Hand me the weapon.

1150
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:28,557
No.

1151
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,659
Dr. Lewis, please.

1152
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,293
I must find the Ghota.

1153
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:39,369
Dr. Lewis.

1154
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,505
Dr. Lewis, are you hurt bad?

1155
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,740
I am not Dr. Lewis.

1156
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:45,842
I am Urp.

1157
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:49,478
I am merely indwelling
in Dr. Lewis' body.

1158
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,646
But this body is damaged.

1159
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,981
I must return to my ship
to repair it.

1160
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,717
I'll take you.

1161
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:56,952
No, I must go alone.

1162
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,322
Be careful, Tammy.

1163
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,313
Urp wants you safe.

1164
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:08,364
There's that polarity again.

1165
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,730
Fascinating.

1166
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:22,244
That's called
obstruction of justice, Tammy.

1167
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:24,981
You're in a tub
of trouble, girl.

1168
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:28,041
Wait for me inside the diner.

1169
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:32,922
Unit three.

1170
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,824
Chief.

1171
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,393
Chief, are you there?

1172
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,661
Ted Lewis has gone insane.

1173
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,396
He's-he's armed and dangerous.

1174
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:41,496
He escaped.

1175
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:43,699
What the-

1176
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,003
What-what's going on?

1177
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:15,597
Some blast of a day,
huh, baby?

1178
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,367
Monster attack,
people getting slimed,

1179
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,702
spaceship.

1180
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,503
Dick, please.

1181
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:23,494
Sorry.

1182
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:26,041
<i>The Blob.</i>

1183
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:27,543
Jeez, that's all we need
right now,

1184
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,273
to see a monster movie.

1185
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,150
Come on.

1186
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,210
Come on.

1187
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:52,099
Hello?

1188
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,371
Anybody there?

1189
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:32,875
Salt.

1190
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,409
Yes.

1191
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:36,936
Salt.

1192
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,336
Mojave police.
Dawson here.

1193
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,371
Chief, it's Lana Lewis.

1194
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:04,940
Please, you have to help me.
It's Ted.

1195
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:06,474
There's something terribly wrong
with him.

1196
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:08,443
Yes, I know, Mrs. Lewis.

1197
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:12,315
He's-he's stolen a vehicle
and eluded arrest.

1198
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,815
I got my men
out looking for him.

1199
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:17,485
Listen, I think... I think he
has a head injury or something.

1200
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:19,288
Please, tell your officers
not to hurt him.

1201
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:21,324
Yes, ma'am,
we'll try not to.

1202
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,992
You'll try?

1203
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,427
I'm coming down there
right away.

1204
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,661
Mrs. Lewis, I don't think
that's a very good...

1205
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:28,925
Hello?

1206
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:34,503
News just keeps getting better.

1207
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:37,139
Lana Lewis is on her way here.

1208
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,342
Have you found Lewis yet?

1209
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:44,413
Stiles hasn't, but I expect
he'll call in soon.

1210
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:49,418
I guess I better
look for Lewis myself.

1211
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,353
Mrs. Lewis thinks he got hit
on the head.

1212
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:54,257
I say he just flipped out.

1213
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:55,690
Well, be nice to her, Barnes.

1214
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:56,791
She's a little rattled.

1215
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:58,561
Yes, sir.

1216
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,289
Good man.

1217
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:20,449
Don't even think about it.

1218
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:21,974
I won't.

1219
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:29,824
Dick, I hate these movies.

1220
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:31,092
Let's go.

1221
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,628
Let's see how they get
the monster.

1222
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:35,164
Just another second?

1223
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,264
Watch this.

1224
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,601
I'll bet they flip out
and run like sheep.

1225
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:45,106
Dick, that's the longest
second in history.

1226
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:46,809
- Let's go, please?
- Just another second.

1227
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,688
Dick, I'm feeling like I felt
in the car this morning.

1228
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,391
Hmm?

1229
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:06,661
When the monster attacked.

1230
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:10,599
Where would a Ghota go?

1231
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:14,297
Seeking the greatest
concentration of prey.

1232
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:18,641
Dave.

1233
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,336
David, the theater.

1234
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,849
They're here!
They're here!

1235
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,375
The killers from space,
they're here!

1236
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:10,719
Do you see it?

1237
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,695
Coast looks clear.

1238
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,289
Let's just get out of here.

1239
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,838
Okay.

1240
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:24,206
It's gone.

1241
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,641
Dick, where is it?

1242
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,079
Come on.

1243
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:33,548
Go this way.

1244
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:42,391
Oh!

1245
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,592
It's a monster, Dickie.

1246
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:45,719
Yeah, we know that, you jerk.

1247
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:49,663
Oh, no.

1248
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:55,403
Is anyone in there?

1249
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,739
Tammy?

1250
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,840
Tammy, is that you?

1251
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,940
Penny?

1252
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:00,175
Tammy, the monster's in here.

1253
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:01,610
It can disappear.
It can be anywhere.

1254
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,146
Yeah, we've met.

1255
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:06,148
Tammy!

1256
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,983
It's-it's hunting us.

1257
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:10,152
We keep trying to get out,
but it's blocking our path.

1258
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:11,719
Kids, stay cool.

1259
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:13,188
I'll be right there.

1260
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:26,435
Tammy!

1261
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,203
Tammy, hurry up.

1262
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,764
Stay cool, kids.

1263
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:36,702
Dick, I'm scared.

1264
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,715
Where was it last time
you saw it?

1265
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:41,182
There.

1266
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:45,854
Oh, there it is.

1267
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,288
Oh, no!

1268
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,358
Oh, no.

1269
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,417
Come on, kids, let's split.

1270
01:08:55,532 --> 01:08:59,135
Oh, no!

1271
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:01,228
Oh, no.
It's divided.

1272
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:02,971
Tammy, what do we do?

1273
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,073
Penny!

1274
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,673
Penny, stay back.
Stay back.

1275
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:06,942
Oh, no.

1276
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:29,265
Tammy is safe.

1277
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:30,365
Thank you.

1278
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:33,202
Wow, man, you killed it.

1279
01:09:33,203 --> 01:09:34,302
Stop.
Don't touch it.

1280
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:35,404
- It's not dead.
- What?

1281
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:36,505
It's not dead?

1282
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,805
No, they're merely in stasis.

1283
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:40,876
We must take them back
to my ship before they revive.

1284
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:42,310
Get those curtains
from the door.

1285
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:43,578
We'll wrap the Ghotas in them.

1286
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:46,310
I'll get my truck.

1287
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,081
That was close.

1288
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,487
Ted?

1289
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:52,587
Ted!

1290
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:53,689
We must go.

1291
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,923
Don't you think I'd better-

1292
01:09:54,925 --> 01:09:56,024
- Now.
- Dr. Lewis.

1293
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,126
Hold it right there.

1294
01:09:57,127 --> 01:09:59,461
Ted!

1295
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:00,930
Hold it right there, sir.

1296
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,030
Ted!

1297
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:04,466
- Wait!
- Dr. Lewis.

1298
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:05,568
Oh!

1299
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:07,903
In the name of the law,
do not move that truck.

1300
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:10,206
Ted! Ted!

1301
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:21,550
Barnes, what's going on?

1302
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:22,650
It's Lewis, Chief.

1303
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:23,752
He's kidnapped Tammy.

1304
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:25,685
That's not true.
He's just...

1305
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:28,122
If you know something, kid,
you better tell me fast.

1306
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:29,225
Now, where'd they go?

1307
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,326
To the drive-in.

1308
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:31,527
Don't mess with me, O'Hara.

1309
01:10:31,528 --> 01:10:32,627
Where'd they go?

1310
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:33,996
They went to the butte.

1311
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:35,564
To the meteor crash,
I know it.

1312
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,132
That's where this all
got started.

1313
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:40,034
All right, Barnes,
you radio Stiles.

1314
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:41,703
I think Stiles is dead, Chief.

1315
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,771
A puddle just like Vern.

1316
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:46,242
They found his car parked
near the diner.

1317
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:49,268
Good Lord.

1318
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,181
All right, you, you,
and you, Frank,

1319
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:54,283
you're all deputized.

1320
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:55,551
Get your rifles,
and you follow me.

1321
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,985
- Yes, Chief.
- Dawson!

1322
01:10:56,987 --> 01:10:58,087
It's Ted.

1323
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,622
Don't you dare hurt him;
you hear me?

1324
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:01,689
Mrs. Lewis, this is
official police business.

1325
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,292
Now, get in the car!

1326
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,095
No.

1327
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,063
Just do it.

1328
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:17,934
Well, come on, cats,
let's go.

1329
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,314
Jeez.

1330
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:26,448
Slow down, will you?

1331
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:29,350
This is not good.

1332
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:32,787
Oh, please, no more not good.

1333
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:37,893
He's driving like a maniac.

1334
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:39,927
Oh, Dawson.

1335
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:41,130
We'll catch him, all right.

1336
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:43,399
- Barnes, is your revolver loaded?
- Dawson!

1337
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:53,408
There!

1338
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:54,710
Turn here through that tunnel.

1339
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:55,810
But my ship is ahead.

1340
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:56,912
Turn here.

1341
01:11:56,912 --> 01:12:00,814
This is a shortcut to the butte.

1342
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:09,390
Be calm.

1343
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:12,359
It is still in stasis.

1344
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:29,744
Move your vehicle away.

1345
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:30,845
They'll be here soon.

1346
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:40,055
Urp.

1347
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:41,155
Urp!

1348
01:12:41,157 --> 01:12:44,326
Barnes, watch this side.

1349
01:12:44,327 --> 01:12:45,793
They're here.

1350
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,099
No!

1351
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,199
Tammy, get back.

1352
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,634
I will not.

1353
01:12:52,635 --> 01:12:54,036
What are you gonna do,
shoot him?

1354
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,136
And for what?

1355
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:56,671
For murdering
half a dozen people.

1356
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:57,773
He didn't do it, Chief.

1357
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:59,341
The Ghota did.

1358
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:01,710
His name is Urp.

1359
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,545
No, it's not.

1360
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,413
That's my husband, Ted.

1361
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:06,515
He's not well.

1362
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:07,682
No, it's Urp.

1363
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:09,952
He's borrowed Ted's body.

1364
01:13:09,953 --> 01:13:11,587
He captured the Ghota.

1365
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:12,688
He saved us.

1366
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:13,788
He saved the whole Earth.

1367
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,425
All he wants is a few hours
to repair his ship

1368
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:17,559
and leave in peace.

1369
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,961
Tammy, I'll shoot
if I have to.

1370
01:13:18,962 --> 01:13:20,061
Now, get out of the way.

1371
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:21,195
This is police business.

1372
01:13:21,197 --> 01:13:24,198
It is our business,
Dawson, ours,

1373
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,600
all of us,
humans.

1374
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:31,439
This traveler from another world
spared us

1375
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,376
from an unspeakable catastrophe.

1376
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:37,746
We don't just live on a planet.

1377
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:41,483
We live in a universe,
a big universe,

1378
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:45,953
and it's filled with ice planets
and spaceships

1379
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:50,259
and-and worlds
with other beings like Urp.

1380
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:54,930
It's a place of unimaginable
beauty and wonder.

1381
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,033
And it's there
for us to explore.

1382
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,333
So what are we gonna do,

1383
01:13:59,335 --> 01:14:01,203
stay cooped up
in our little towns

1384
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:02,570
and our little lives

1385
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:05,506
and end up as small, frightened
puddles of our own making?

1386
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:08,844
Please, don't make this
any worse, Chief Dawson.

1387
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:12,439
Let him repair his ship
and leave.

1388
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:24,560
All right, Marshal Urp.

1389
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,728
I'll let you off this time
with a warning.

1390
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:31,065
Fix your spaceship and...

1391
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:33,761
keep your goats off our planet;
you got that?

1392
01:14:36,206 --> 01:14:38,907
We apologize
for this trespass.

1393
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:40,208
We had feared landing on Earth

1394
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,844
because
our intelligence indicated

1395
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:45,180
that you were a pathetically
primitive life-form.

1396
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,949
But I have seen
that you are more than this.

1397
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:50,819
You possess determination,
resourcefulness,

1398
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:54,523
and uncommon courage.

1399
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:57,458
You will need these qualities
to survive the dangers

1400
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,627
that await and challenge
an awakening world.

1401
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:04,131
This spaceship will depart
at sunrise.

1402
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:07,158
Be advised to stand clear.

1403
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,363
Urp.

1404
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:16,912
Urp thanks you
for your assistance.

1405
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:19,014
Will I...

1406
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,248
Will I ever see you again?

1407
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:22,307
That is unknowable.

1408
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:25,887
I'll miss you.

1409
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:28,515
Urp will miss Tammy.

1410
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:37,533
Tammy?

1411
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,801
Urp would seek
this polarity with you

1412
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:42,292
if Urp was a human.

1413
01:15:50,179 --> 01:15:53,238
But I still
do not understand it.

1414
01:15:55,118 --> 01:15:56,984
Good-bye, Tammy.

1415
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:59,578
I have a long journey to make.

1416
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:03,792
So do I.

1417
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:07,456
Good-bye, Urp.

1418
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:10,231
Ted?

1419
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,067
I am not Ted.

1420
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,092
Ted will be returned
momentarily.

1421
01:16:29,586 --> 01:16:31,144
Ted?

1422
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,188
Lana?

1423
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:34,288
Where are we?

1424
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:35,847
Oh.
Oh, Ted.

1425
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,527
Thank goodness.

1426
01:17:10,393 --> 01:17:11,859
I had a pipe.

1427
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:44,091
You okay, Dr. Lewis?

1428
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,627
Yes, I think so.

1429
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:47,828
Good.

1430
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:51,390
Good, just try not to steal
any more cars, okay?

1431
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:54,269
What happened?

1432
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,936
All I remember
was that I was here,

1433
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:58,273
and now I'm here.

1434
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:00,408
What on Earth am I wearing?

1435
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:03,278
I'll tell you all about it,
darling...

1436
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:05,542
later.

1437
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,685
Hey, Code,
why the long face?

1438
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,052
Can you dig this, cats?

1439
01:18:11,054 --> 01:18:12,520
I didn't even bring the camera.

1440
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,921
No one will ever believe it.

1441
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:15,423
What's it matter, Code?

1442
01:18:15,425 --> 01:18:18,189
We're alive, and we've had
the adventure of a lifetime.
