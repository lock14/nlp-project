1
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:35,345
You fixed it yet?

2
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:37,350
Just a couple more minutes.

3
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,278
You said that an hour ago.

4
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:41,428
I promised
to make you dinner, right?

5
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:42,317
Yeah.

6
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:44,674
Well, I'm making you
a gourmet dinner.

7
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,297
Trust me.
It'll be worth the wait.

8
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:52,941
Surrender.

9
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:54,365
Hmm?

10
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:56,825
Surrender to the wonders
of takeout.

11
00:03:57,328 --> 00:03:57,750
Oh.

12
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:00,733
I knew this was coming.

13
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:04,707
'Cause when your fingers dial
those seven little numbers,

14
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:06,139
it really turns me on.

15
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,370
Is that the best
you can come up with?

16
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,571
Yeah.

17
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:15,308
Wow. You are fast.

18
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:33,738
Who was it?

19
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,150
I don't know.

20
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:41,941
It doesn't even say
where it's from.

21
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:44,642
Well, there's
one way to find out.

22
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,285
Oh, Jamie,
you adopted us a baby.

23
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:01,797
A baby?
Have you seen this thing?

24
00:05:02,284 --> 00:05:03,456
Well, who would send you
a doll?

25
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:04,326
I have no idea.

26
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,584
There's no card, no note.

27
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:10,196
His eyes look so real.

28
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:17,509
"I don't know about you, but
Lisa's hungry for Chinese."

29
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,460
I think
my wife's gone crazy.

30
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:22,718
Oh, my God! This reminds me of
that poem from when we were kids.

31
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:24,356
What poem?

32
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:26,711
You remember. Come on.

33
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:28,447
That old ghost story about the
woman who had all those dolls.

34
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,186
"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw

35
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:35,480
"She had no children,
only dolls..."

36
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:38,068
And something,
something scary.

37
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:40,783
Something, something... Boo!

38
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:45,064
I think you're having just a
little too much fun there, Lise.

39
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:47,170
Oh, baby, I won't let
the scary dummy hurt you.

40
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:48,918
Thank you. Thank you.

41
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:27,468
If you get Jamie to scream,

42
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:32,583
I'll make sure you get seven minutes
in heaven with my old Barbie. Deal?

43
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:34,224
"Yes, Lisa."

44
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:36,639
God, I'm such a loser.

45
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,848
Good boy.

46
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:52,918
Jamie?

47
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:53,806
Jamie?

48
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,304
Baby, I'm back.

49
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:05,268
Lisa! What are you trying
to do? Burn the place down?

50
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:08,297
Lise?

51
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:14,268
Oh, Lisa.

52
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,919
<i>I'm in here.</i>

53
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:24,449
Dinner in bed again.

54
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:35,944
Lisa!

55
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:38,706
<i>Yes, Jamie?</i>

56
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:41,093
What's going on?

57
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:47,833
<i>- I have a surprise for you, Jamie.
- ...for you, Jamie.</i>

58
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,280
Lisa, this is not funny!

59
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,664
The strange is that she's
got no defensive wounds.

60
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:12,690
Now, if somebody was trying to
turn my face into a jack-o'-lantern,

61
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:14,423
I'd be fighting back a little.

62
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,967
Yeah, but then you always have
been a little feisty, my girl.

63
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:21,780
Ligature marks?

64
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:22,566
Not a one.

65
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:23,601
- What about...
- Drugs?

66
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:30,250
That's a gift. I think the words
here, and they come out there.

67
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,218
Preliminary results say no.

68
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,873
But the final tox results
won't be in for 48 hours.

69
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:37,839
Personally, I think only someone
high as a kite would kill his wife

70
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,166
and then pose her
as a mannequin.

71
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:41,161
But the weirdest thing
is her face.

72
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,763
I've never seen
anything like it.

73
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,495
You know what it was?
Your mistake?

74
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:02,655
It was the rose.

75
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:06,387
Yep. Boy, I'll tell you,

76
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:08,865
if I had a dollar for every time
some guy gave his wife a rose

77
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:10,549
on the day that he,
you know...

78
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:11,708
Like that's an alibi.

79
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,082
Alibi?

80
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:17,350
I didn't hear you.
Did you say something?

81
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,035
Why would I need an alibi?

82
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:24,652
I'm sure your lawyer
would want you to have one.

83
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:26,055
My lawyer?

84
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:26,933
Yeah.

85
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,306
I mean, the prosecution, they're
going to have your fingerprints,

86
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:30,891
no signs of forced entry
on your apartment,

87
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:33,918
and you as the last person
to see your wife alive.

88
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,716
I mean, that's a lot
to go up against.

89
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,084
You think
I killed my wife?

90
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,055
Excuse me?

91
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,060
Do you think
I killed my wife?

92
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,468
No. No, I don't think you did.

93
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,262
I'm just trying
to help your lawyer out.

94
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,671
I mean, he's going to need
something more concrete.

95
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:50,871
I mean, at least to shift
the suspicion away from you.

96
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:54,990
Suspicion? I mean, if you
want to talk suspicion,

97
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,536
why don't you start by looking at the
package that turned up on my doorstep?

98
00:13:57,828 --> 00:13:59,615
Oh, yeah.
That package, right.

99
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,740
Let's see. You received
an unmarked package

100
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,473
just moments
before Lisa was killed.

101
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,501
Yeah. A package containing
a ventriloquist dummy.

102
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:08,888
Ventriloquist dummy. Yeah.

103
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:12,653
Well, the mystery toy
department is down the hall.

104
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:14,947
This is
the homicide department.

105
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:17,094
So unless you can tell me
how some puppet

106
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:19,391
ties into your wife's murder,
I don't see the relevance.

107
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:25,710
In the town where I'm from,

108
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:30,041
a ventriloquist dummy
is a bad omen.

109
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:31,945
It's kind of a local legend,

110
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:35,471
and some people believe that the dummy
brings death to those around them.

111
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:41,821
Okay.

112
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:44,271
Well, Jamie,

113
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:48,482
I've never arrested a dummy
for murder before.

114
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:51,337
But I have arrested
quite a few husbands.

115
00:14:52,854 --> 00:14:54,940
You don't think it's weird
that this package arrives

116
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,422
right before Lisa is killed?

117
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:57,768
No, I'll tell you
what I think is weird.

118
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:02,770
You said that your wife spoke to you
just moments before you found her, right?

119
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,535
- Yeah.
- Yeah. But she didn't have a tongue.

120
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:08,855
In fact, according to you,
she was already dead.

121
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:11,256
Now, see, to me, that's weird.

122
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,251
So, what're you going to do?
Arrest me?

123
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:17,999
Not yet.

124
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:23,809
Look, you can go, Ashen.

125
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:26,222
You're a free man for now.

126
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:29,075
Good.

127
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,989
It'll give me more time
to do your job for you.

128
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:22,254
Jamie!

129
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,094
I'm so sorry for your loss.

130
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:30,450
But I'm so glad
to have you home.

131
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:32,242
Oh!

132
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,149
My Lord, you must think I'm so rude.

133
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:36,894
We haven't even
been introduced.

134
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:39,061
I'm Ella.

135
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,713
I'm...

136
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:44,427
Well, I guess
I'm your stepmother.

137
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:47,359
Is he in?

138
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,014
Yes, he is.

139
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:51,165
Please come in.

140
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:51,887
Thanks.

141
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:54,363
There are some things that you
need to know about your father.

142
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:55,347
I know everything I need to.

143
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,376
Ella!
Who's down there with you?

144
00:18:58,376 --> 00:19:00,015
Your father won't
fight you, Jamie.

145
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,075
He doesn't fight anyone,
not anymore.

146
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,987
Well, then you're not
married to my father.

147
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:05,557
Ella!

148
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:17,155
I can hear you.

149
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:20,399
Goddamn chair is stuck.

150
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,358
Here, Edward,
let me help you.

151
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:34,471
My son.
What a pleasant surprise.

152
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:35,781
What happened to you?

153
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:37,855
Your father had a stroke
two months ago.

154
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,089
Why didn't anybody tell me?

155
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:41,293
You never return my calls.

156
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:44,127
It's because I never know
what to say to you.

157
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:47,887
I take it I wasn't the easiest
person to get along with in the past,

158
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,652
- but I've changed.
- Really?

159
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:53,084
Yes. A stroke can do that
to a man.

160
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:57,062
Listen, I'm sorry
about your wife.

161
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:59,758
I hear you've
brought her home.

162
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,366
- Yeah.
- Don't worry.

163
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,799
I'll call Henry Walker,
make the arrangements.

164
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,609
No, that's okay,
I can take care of it.

165
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:08,417
Jamie, please. As your father,
it's the least I can do.

166
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,929
You've done the least
you can do my whole life.

167
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:12,395
It's too late
for charity now.

168
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,719
Is that why you've come here,

169
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,049
to remind me what a bad
father I've been to you?

170
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,460
In light of what has happened, I was
hoping we could put that in the past.

171
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,972
I didn't come
to talk about that, I...

172
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,188
I came to ask you something.

173
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:30,195
Do you remember when I was a
kid, Mom used to read me a poem?

174
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,911
Do you remember what it was?

175
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,785
What poem?

176
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:39,182
"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw

177
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:42,053
"She had no children,
only dolls

178
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:44,707
"And if you see her
in your dreams..."

179
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:48,168
"Be sure you never,
ever scream"

180
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,415
You know it?

181
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,348
It's just a scary poem parents would
tell their kids to keep them in line.

182
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,060
No. It's more than just a ghost story.
And the adults believed in it, as well.

183
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,946
We live
in a small town, Jamie.

184
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,181
Small minds breed
small-minded superstitions.

185
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:03,350
That's all.
There's nothing else to tell.

186
00:21:03,848 --> 00:21:04,785
Nothing?

187
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,887
Edward,

188
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:07,511
your son has been
through a lot.

189
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:09,257
Why don't we make up
a room for him?

190
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,428
No, that's okay.
I'm not staying long.

191
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:15,388
I got a funeral to prepare.

192
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:17,556
Jamie, Jamie!

193
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:21,961
Jamie! Please wait.

194
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:24,626
Won't you stay the night here?

195
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:25,657
It was nice meeting you, Ella.

196
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:28,291
Your father's changed. He's not
the same man that you remember.

197
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:29,474
Really?

198
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:33,115
You see that?

199
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:37,451
Mom used to be in that picture with
us, until he drove her to kill herself.

200
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,210
Had his second wife
in that one there.

201
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:42,268
But she was smart enough
to leave.

202
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:44,452
So, it's a good thing you're
going to outlive him, lady.

203
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:46,220
There'll be no one
to paint you out.

204
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:58,950
What more?

205
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:01,425
What more do you
want from me?

206
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:04,465
Peck, peck, peck,
peck, peck, peck.

207
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:07,778
I must say I was deeply
saddened to hear the news.

208
00:22:08,552 --> 00:22:13,108
If you're up to it, I can walk you
through the various casket options we have.

209
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:16,151
Or we can do it later.

210
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:19,520
It's okay.
Let's... Let's do it now.

211
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,482
Okay. Now, I don't know
what your preferences are.

212
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:25,325
Have you spoken
to her family yet?

213
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,505
Only once. We didn't really
talk about casket choices.

214
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:33,721
When is she arriving?

215
00:22:34,594 --> 00:22:35,572
Tonight.

216
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:40,331
Once the police have released
her body, then I'll pick her up.

217
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:48,864
Oh, I'll need you to fill out
these forms, at your convenience.

218
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:37,057
<i>Jamie.</i>

219
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,494
<i>Jamie!</i>

220
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:11,744
No, it can't be.

221
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,173
Marion?

222
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:25,568
Marion, is that you?

223
00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:35,988
Marion, I told you
not to go down there anymore.

224
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:36,559
The silent time's here.

225
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,056
Now, come out of there
and go to bed.

226
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:40,088
She's here now.

227
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:41,800
I know it.

228
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:42,829
Marion,

229
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:44,560
I don't have time
to play games.

230
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:46,714
She won't find me down here.

231
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:48,558
Marion, I'm not
going to ask you again.

232
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,659
Let's go. Come on, come on.

233
00:26:57,711 --> 00:26:59,724
You just shush now.

234
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:02,656
The silent time is here.

235
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:03,453
Go on.

236
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:04,951
Go on up. I'll be up later.

237
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,566
Did you see her? Did you?

238
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:45,845
When she killed your wife?
Did you see her do it?

239
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:47,299
Killed my wife?
What are you talking about?

240
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:50,055
"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw

241
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,773
"She had no children,
only dolls

242
00:28:53,738 --> 00:28:55,375
"And if you see her
in your dreams..."

243
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:56,237
Marion!

244
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:58,745
She's here. No one's safe.

245
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,756
- No one's safe.
- Come, Marion.

246
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:01,047
- Marion, you leave him alone.
- No one's safe.

247
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,745
- This is not the time.
- What's she talking about?

248
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,620
I'm sorry, Jamie. She doesn't
know what she's saying.

249
00:29:07,927 --> 00:29:09,160
She's here!

250
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,470
Come. I'm going to take you home
now. Let's go, let's go. Come on.

251
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,395
You must bury the doll!
Bury the doll!

252
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:14,900
Leave him alone.
Leave him alone. Come on.

253
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,307
Marion, we'll go home now.

254
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:18,002
Who dug you up?

255
00:33:56,637 --> 00:33:58,949
Thought I asked you
not to leave the city.

256
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,770
I came to bury my wife.
You got a problem with that?

257
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:04,726
Nope.

258
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:09,460
Problem is, she's not the
only one that you came to bury.

259
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:12,736
So, you've been
following me now?

260
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:16,216
You know, Jamie,
you really are forcing me

261
00:34:16,216 --> 00:34:17,730
to use the word "perplexed"
an awful lot lately.

262
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:25,955
You mind telling me
what the hell that is?

263
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:30,244
Okay. Since you don't want
to answer my questions,

264
00:34:30,962 --> 00:34:33,127
maybe you'd like
to answer his.

265
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:39,024
"Why did you bury me, Jamie?

266
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:41,660
"Is it because I'm evidence
in a capital crime,

267
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:46,019
"a crime that you are
the number one suspect in?"

268
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,941
You understand
what I'm saying here?

269
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:55,699
It's like I told you before.

270
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,021
The night Lisa was murdered,
somebody sent it to me.

271
00:34:59,226 --> 00:35:00,784
It just arrived
on our doorstep.

272
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:03,425
So, why'd you bury it?

273
00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:05,952
It came from that cemetery.
I was just putting it back.

274
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:07,137
In the cemetery?

275
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:12,015
There's an old ghost story around
here about a woman named Mary Shaw.

276
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:14,141
She was buried
with her doll collection.

277
00:35:14,141 --> 00:35:18,026
Now, the story goes, "If you ever
see her, make sure you never scream."

278
00:35:18,026 --> 00:35:18,648
Or what?

279
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:22,191
Oh.

280
00:35:22,593 --> 00:35:24,527
Or you end up
without a tongue.

281
00:35:24,527 --> 00:35:26,274
I guess your wife
didn't listen, then, huh?

282
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:27,272
You son of a...

283
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:28,177
Hey! Hey!

284
00:35:28,488 --> 00:35:29,660
Settle down, Jamie.

285
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:33,746
Let's not add assaulting an officer
to your list of offenses here.

286
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:38,659
So you're trying to tell me
that a ghost killed your wife?

287
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:40,131
I don't know,
I don't know.

288
00:35:40,131 --> 00:35:41,047
What do you know?

289
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:42,576
I do know
whoever sent this to me

290
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:45,296
either knows who killed my
wife or did it themselves.

291
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:46,301
Hmm.

292
00:35:47,163 --> 00:35:48,095
That's a theory.

293
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,497
I'm going to go.

294
00:35:50,763 --> 00:35:54,838
And I hope you don't mind me taking
our little friend here with me,

295
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:57,533
seeing as he's evidence
and all.

296
00:35:58,149 --> 00:35:59,183
Great.

297
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:03,780
Good night, neighbor.

298
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,268
Neighbor?

299
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:17,299
Sleep tight.

300
00:36:39,337 --> 00:36:42,551
You know, I noticed
you have very smooth skin.

301
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:46,726
What's your secret?

302
00:36:47,618 --> 00:36:48,458
Oh.

303
00:36:49,488 --> 00:36:51,328
Well, that never works for me.

304
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:31,808
Friend of yours?

305
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:35,610
You said Mary Shaw
killed my wife.

306
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:37,468
Why would you say that?

307
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:38,560
Marion.

308
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,513
Marion, please!

309
00:37:40,513 --> 00:37:42,899
Yes, I know, I know...

310
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:45,173
What do you know
about Mary Shaw?

311
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:48,542
I didn't say anything! I...

312
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:55,078
You're... You're not
supposed to have that.

313
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,466
Where did you get that?

314
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,510
Maybe you can tell me.

315
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:00,835
It's hers!

316
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:03,457
Who? Mary Shaw's?

317
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:05,982
We don't say her name
around here.

318
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:10,258
You don't say her name.
Well, why don't you try, huh?

319
00:38:11,837 --> 00:38:13,690
It might just help me
find out who killed my wife.

320
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:20,881
There are things you remember, and
there are things you can't forget.

321
00:38:22,238 --> 00:38:25,093
Like the look on that
woman's face when she died.

322
00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:33,752
Her name was Mary Shaw, the
ventriloquist who lost her voice.

323
00:38:34,623 --> 00:38:38,451
Back when I was a boy, those were
the glory days of Ravens Fair,

324
00:38:38,726 --> 00:38:42,129
<i>and the town built itself
a grand old theater,</i>

325
00:38:42,129 --> 00:38:45,658
<i>the Guignol Theater,
out on Lost Lake.</i>

326
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:50,015
<i>I only ever went there once.</i>

327
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:58,149
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare to be astounded.

328
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:00,187
Prepare to be amazed.

329
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:05,599
Witness Mary Shaw give life
to the boy made of wood.

330
00:39:19,629 --> 00:39:22,028
Where is Billy?

331
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,634
Billy!

332
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:26,244
Where are you, Billy?

333
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:29,016
You won't find me, Mother!

334
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,659
I knew
you were hiding out there!

335
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:37,362
You, there!

336
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,943
Could you check
under your seat for me?

337
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:49,991
He's here!

338
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:53,622
Would you mind
bringing him to me?

339
00:39:58,238 --> 00:39:59,939
Good boy.

340
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:07,239
Say thank you.

341
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,674
Thank you, Henry.

342
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:13,216
Is that right, young man?

343
00:40:13,216 --> 00:40:15,132
Is your name Henry?

344
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:24,280
Well, I guess my boy's
had his eye on you.

345
00:40:24,954 --> 00:40:28,023
Now, why did you
run away, Billy?

346
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:30,099
Don't I treat you well?

347
00:40:30,317 --> 00:40:33,394
Oh, yes, you're the best
mother I could ever hope for!

348
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:37,873
It's just that it gets so
dusty inside that little box,

349
00:40:38,515 --> 00:40:39,572
it makes me want to...

350
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:41,491
- Want to what?
- Want to...

351
00:40:42,293 --> 00:40:42,920
Want to...

352
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:49,639
Oh, Billy!

353
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:52,870
You sneezed all over my shoe!

354
00:40:55,378 --> 00:40:58,593
I'm sorry, Mother.
I can't help it.

355
00:40:58,593 --> 00:41:00,231
I can see
your lips moving!

356
00:41:02,435 --> 00:41:04,209
What?

357
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:10,372
Who said that?

358
00:41:10,372 --> 00:41:11,838
I did. I can see it.

359
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:13,632
Her lips are moving.

360
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:16,959
What do you say
to that, Billy?

361
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:19,836
Young Michael here doesn't
think you're a real person!

362
00:41:20,183 --> 00:41:21,426
What do you mean, Mother?

363
00:41:21,628 --> 00:41:22,894
He thinks you're a dummy,

364
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:25,653
and that I'm doing
your voice for you.

365
00:41:29,216 --> 00:41:31,173
But that can't be true!

366
00:41:31,173 --> 00:41:34,480
There's no way you'd give me
all the good lines!

367
00:41:34,698 --> 00:41:35,853
Forget about him, Billy!

368
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:39,097
There will always be doubters!

369
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:41,298
I don't want
to forget, Mother!

370
00:41:41,953 --> 00:41:45,729
I think we should show
this boy just how real I am.

371
00:41:45,729 --> 00:41:46,227
I'm just as real as him!

372
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:47,163
No.

373
00:41:47,163 --> 00:41:50,441
I'm afraid we must go on with the show.

374
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,341
No! I'm as real as you are,
and I'll show you!

375
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:53,744
Leave him alone, Billy!

376
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:54,899
I'll show him
what it's like, Mother!

377
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:55,871
Listen to me! That's enough!

378
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:56,927
I'm as real as you!

379
00:41:56,927 --> 00:41:59,288
- No more!
- Bring him up here!

380
00:42:11,953 --> 00:42:16,118
Now who's the dummy?

381
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:20,265
Some weeks later, that disbelieving
little boy went missing.

382
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:22,090
Gone without a trace.

383
00:42:23,822 --> 00:42:28,239
But I always felt that Mary
Shaw played some role in it.

384
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:31,001
And not long after that,
she was murdered.

385
00:42:32,293 --> 00:42:33,087
Who killed her?

386
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:34,481
No one ever found out.

387
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:40,033
In her will, Mary stated that her
dummies were to be buried with her,

388
00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:43,151
her children,
as she called them.

389
00:42:43,572 --> 00:42:45,108
All 101 of them.

390
00:42:49,545 --> 00:42:52,202
<i>Her body was brought
to my father's mortuary,</i>

391
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:54,916
so he could begin work
on her other final request.

392
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:03,666
Not only did she ask
to be buried with her dolls,

393
00:43:04,087 --> 00:43:07,549
she asked to become
a doll herself.

394
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:12,070
Henry, are you all right?

395
00:45:12,698 --> 00:45:17,565
Ever since she was buried, Ravens
Fair has been plagued by death,

396
00:45:18,107 --> 00:45:19,903
families murdered.

397
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:24,502
They were found
without their tongues.

398
00:45:28,948 --> 00:45:31,495
Posed in family portraits.

399
00:45:36,924 --> 00:45:39,384
Your wife's is the last.

400
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,187
How could you take
these pictures?

401
00:45:46,956 --> 00:45:49,841
No, I have to take pictures.
It's part of my business.

402
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:52,527
Who would have dug up
the dummy and sent it to me?

403
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:53,738
I don't know.

404
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:59,999
No one in this town dares
speak Mary Shaw's name,

405
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:02,085
let alone go near her grave.

406
00:46:02,914 --> 00:46:06,845
They know she won't stop
killing until the screaming does.

407
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:12,174
You said she lived out
at that old theater, right?

408
00:46:12,174 --> 00:46:13,625
The one on Lost Lake?

409
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:14,441
Jamie!

410
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:16,029
Jamie, please!

411
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,238
Please be careful.

412
00:46:22,018 --> 00:46:25,606
If you go looking for answers,
you just might find them.

413
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:26,797
That's what I'm counting on.

414
00:51:53,281 --> 00:51:54,392
Morning, Mary.

415
00:51:54,392 --> 00:51:55,994
I'm just going to go
check in on the kids.

416
00:51:55,994 --> 00:51:56,743
<i>Mama! Mama! Mama.</i>

417
00:51:56,743 --> 00:51:57,719
What do you want
with him? What is it?

418
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:58,319
What do you want?
We did what you wanted.

419
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,048
We put you in there with
your family, all together.

420
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:04,734
Why can't you
just leave us alone?

421
00:52:05,884 --> 00:52:06,820
<i>Why won't you?</i>

422
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:08,427
I didn't do anything!

423
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:09,924
<i>Yes, you did. You talked.</i>

424
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:12,242
I didn't talk! I didn't!

425
00:52:12,242 --> 00:52:15,493
I didn't say anything!
I didn't!

426
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:19,535
Hey!

427
00:52:20,563 --> 00:52:22,451
Say something.

428
00:52:23,964 --> 00:52:26,569
Why have you gone so quiet?

429
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:30,787
I'm putting you back where
you belong, once and for all!

430
00:52:30,787 --> 00:52:32,469
- He talked to me!
- Stop it!

431
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:35,732
He did, he talked to me,
he talked to me.

432
00:53:19,242 --> 00:53:20,615
Marion?

433
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:29,600
Marion, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

434
00:53:43,898 --> 00:53:45,242
Marion?

435
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,887
You don't have
to hide anymore.

436
00:53:49,282 --> 00:53:50,888
This will all be over soon.

437
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:53,646
Marion?

438
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,517
Marion?

439
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:09,872
Marion, now
you come on out now!

440
00:54:15,863 --> 00:54:16,445
Ma...

441
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,020
Marion?

442
00:54:35,508 --> 00:54:37,232
Marion, open the door.

443
00:54:38,198 --> 00:54:41,099
Marion! Come on,
no games, Marion!

444
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:42,773
Open the door!

445
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:06,837
Marion, open this door,
please! Marion!

446
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,197
<i>Hello, Henry!</i>

447
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:32,720
Oh, my God.

448
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:52,727
<i>You're voice
is mine now, Henry.</i>

449
00:56:08,896 --> 00:56:11,263
Jamie, you're
just in time for dinner.

450
00:56:11,532 --> 00:56:12,168
I'm not hungry.

451
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:13,135
It's soup.

452
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:15,601
Delicious, too,
if I must say so myself.

453
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:16,786
I'll vouch for that.

454
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:19,986
I didn't come here to eat,
I came to talk

455
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:21,650
about Mary Shaw.

456
00:56:23,836 --> 00:56:24,801
You lied to me.

457
00:56:25,003 --> 00:56:25,831
No, I didn't.

458
00:56:27,561 --> 00:56:29,272
- Sit down.
- No, I want the truth.

459
00:56:29,272 --> 00:56:32,626
What does Michael Ashen and our
family have to do with Mary Shaw?

460
00:56:34,622 --> 00:56:35,258
Fine.

461
00:56:37,316 --> 00:56:38,620
When he was a boy,

462
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:42,859
your great-uncle, Michael
Ashen, vanished without a trace.

463
00:56:45,272 --> 00:56:47,862
For our family, there
was only ever one suspect,

464
00:56:48,382 --> 00:56:49,412
Mary Shaw.

465
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,325
So, they dealt
their own justice.

466
00:56:55,122 --> 00:56:56,740
<i>They forced her to scream.</i>

467
00:56:59,735 --> 00:57:01,811
Then cut out her tongue.

468
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,479
Our family killed her?

469
00:57:03,479 --> 00:57:05,485
Along with others
from Ravens Fair.

470
00:57:06,864 --> 00:57:08,881
But she didn't stay dead.

471
00:57:10,281 --> 00:57:12,907
She came back
and took her revenge.

472
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:17,909
One by one, each of the men
involved were killed.

473
00:57:18,408 --> 00:57:19,969
Their tongues ripped out.

474
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:23,370
And then the same thing
happened to their wives.

475
00:57:24,012 --> 00:57:25,148
And then their children.

476
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:27,994
And their children's children.

477
00:57:28,268 --> 00:57:30,997
All these years you've resented
me for sending you away,

478
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:34,028
but I did it to distance you
from this curse.

479
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:36,207
Distance?

480
00:57:36,883 --> 00:57:38,204
Well, it found Lisa!

481
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:41,794
Lisa's death made me realize
we can't run from our fate.

482
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,709
Spirits have long memories.

483
00:57:46,823 --> 00:57:49,190
She'll come for us in the end.

484
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:51,281
Now I'm paying
for the sins of my fathers.

485
00:57:51,503 --> 00:57:53,027
Jamie, I'm sorry.

486
00:57:53,027 --> 00:57:56,812
All I ever meant to do was to protect
you, even if it earned your hatred.

487
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,406
I don't know how,
but one way or another,

488
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,179
I'm going to stop this thing.

489
00:58:03,225 --> 00:58:04,441
Please, Son!

490
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:07,545
Well, hey, there!

491
00:58:07,545 --> 00:58:10,433
I was wondering if you could help
me with a missing person's case.

492
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:11,244
Wait.

493
00:58:12,074 --> 00:58:14,823
I'm looking for a male, brown
hair, he's around this tall,

494
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,007
sometimes seen
with a hand up his ass.

495
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:22,182
Actually, his brothers and sisters
have just gone missing, too.

496
00:58:22,805 --> 00:58:23,997
What are you talking about?

497
00:58:24,226 --> 00:58:25,224
Somebody dug them up.

498
00:58:26,721 --> 00:58:27,552
All 100 of them.

499
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:31,235
What I want to know is
who did it and why.

500
00:58:31,235 --> 00:58:31,804
So do I!

501
00:58:33,201 --> 00:58:36,317
Don't give me some ghost story about
a woman who kills you if you scream,

502
00:58:36,317 --> 00:58:38,511
because nobody in this town
has ever heard of Mary Shaw

503
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:39,458
or your little fairy tale.

504
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:40,616
They're lying!

505
00:58:40,616 --> 00:58:41,739
They're afraid!

506
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:42,487
Afraid of what?

507
00:58:43,236 --> 00:58:44,091
Afraid of ghosts?

508
00:58:44,736 --> 00:58:48,162
Or are they afraid of talking to the cop
who's investigating your wife's murder?

509
00:58:48,162 --> 00:58:50,116
They have no reason
to protect me.

510
00:58:51,688 --> 00:58:53,654
But they believe in Mary Shaw.

511
00:58:54,389 --> 00:58:56,416
That's why they won't answer
your stupid questions.

512
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,982
No, it's you who won't
answer my questions, Jamie.

513
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:00,882
That's why I'm going to arrest
you for stealing evidence.

514
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:02,852
Then I'm going to sit
you down, and you will...

515
00:59:02,852 --> 00:59:03,957
What do you want
me to tell you?

516
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:06,899
Something less perplexing
than a ghost story. Come on.

517
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:10,067
Jamie, is everything
all right?

518
00:59:13,794 --> 00:59:16,029
It's for you.
They said it was urgent.

519
00:59:18,277 --> 00:59:18,882
Go ahead.

520
00:59:22,931 --> 00:59:24,268
<i>- Hello?
- Jamie.</i>

521
00:59:24,268 --> 00:59:25,189
Who is this?

522
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:28,542
<i>Jamie?</i>

523
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:30,072
Henry?

524
00:59:30,307 --> 00:59:31,617
<i>I can prove it.</i>

525
00:59:31,617 --> 00:59:33,571
Henry, I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

526
00:59:33,926 --> 00:59:35,048
<i>I can prove it.</i>

527
00:59:35,827 --> 00:59:38,089
<i>I can... you didn't kill her.</i>

528
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:41,506
<i>There's a way, at the theater.</i>

529
00:59:41,506 --> 00:59:43,505
<i>Meet me at the theater.
It's on Lost Lake.</i>

530
00:59:43,505 --> 00:59:44,497
Yeah, I know where it is.

531
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:46,447
<i>Now, Jamie.</i>

532
00:59:47,399 --> 00:59:49,571
Henry, wait!
What have you found?

533
00:59:50,207 --> 00:59:53,172
Henry! Henry!

534
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,366
That was Henry Walker
from the funeral home.

535
00:59:58,366 --> 01:00:00,722
He says he can prove
I didn't kill my wife.

536
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:02,687
Convenient time for
him to call. Let's go.

537
01:00:03,155 --> 01:00:05,590
Wait, wait, wait. I'm going
to meet him at the theater.

538
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:06,740
That's where I'm going.

539
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,990
No, you're going with me.

540
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:08,412
Your appointment
with me comes first.

541
01:00:08,412 --> 01:00:10,506
You wanted answers.
I'm giving you answers.

542
01:00:10,763 --> 01:00:14,111
Camp is over. I'm done with
the ghost stories. Let's go.

543
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:18,945
Listen, we're talking
about my wife here. Come on.

544
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:22,954
Do us both a favor, Jamie.

545
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:25,610
Don't make me cuff you
in front of your mom.

546
01:00:30,301 --> 01:00:31,144
Jamie!

547
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,671
Jamie. Jamie!

548
01:00:35,076 --> 01:00:37,642
Hey, you don't want
to make me chase you!

549
01:00:37,642 --> 01:00:38,741
Jamie!

550
01:00:41,378 --> 01:00:43,406
I don't have
a full tank of gas!

551
01:01:45,845 --> 01:01:47,009
Jamie!

552
01:01:52,914 --> 01:01:54,224
Henry?

553
01:01:56,127 --> 01:01:57,957
Jamie!

554
01:02:11,587 --> 01:02:12,556
Hello?

555
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:14,960
Where are you?

556
01:02:16,797 --> 01:02:17,609
Henry?

557
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,395
Henry?

558
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:41,228
Henry?

559
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:44,942
<i>Come on, Jamie.
I'm up here.</i>

560
01:02:45,704 --> 01:02:47,077
I'm coming, Jamie.

561
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:22,329
Jamie?

562
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,278
I know you're here.

563
01:03:27,322 --> 01:03:28,802
<i>I'm in here.</i>

564
01:03:46,898 --> 01:03:47,804
Henry?

565
01:04:05,058 --> 01:04:05,650
Henry?

566
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,146
Guess again.

567
01:04:09,627 --> 01:04:10,506
He's here.

568
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:14,063
Nobody's here. Our boats
were the only two out there.

569
01:04:14,063 --> 01:04:14,825
Listen, I'm telling you
he's here!

570
01:04:14,825 --> 01:04:16,337
And I'm telling you

571
01:04:16,551 --> 01:04:18,705
he is not here!

572
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:20,609
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

573
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:27,581
If you say I told you so,
I'll shoot you.

574
01:04:32,194 --> 01:04:33,914
Where the hell are you?

575
01:04:55,986 --> 01:04:57,637
Hang on to this for a second.

576
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:01,578
Where are you going?

577
01:05:15,266 --> 01:05:17,450
Remember, whatever happens,

578
01:05:17,908 --> 01:05:19,198
don't scream.

579
01:05:22,271 --> 01:05:25,114
Jamie. Jamie?

580
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:29,993
Jamie?

581
01:05:32,285 --> 01:05:33,673
Jamie!

582
01:05:39,446 --> 01:05:40,932
You follow me.

583
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,931
All right, Jamie,
where is he?

584
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:50,193
You know, if I see
one more of these...

585
01:07:03,081 --> 01:07:04,783
They're all here.

586
01:07:19,273 --> 01:07:20,022
Yep.

587
01:07:23,313 --> 01:07:24,594
All home.

588
01:07:34,031 --> 01:07:36,282
Someone brought them
back here.

589
01:07:48,096 --> 01:07:50,201
All but one.

590
01:07:51,129 --> 01:07:52,553
What?

591
01:07:56,017 --> 01:07:57,561
What the hell is that?

592
01:08:21,123 --> 01:08:22,733
Is that a doll?

593
01:08:28,344 --> 01:08:30,057
It's not a doll.

594
01:08:32,193 --> 01:08:33,504
It's a boy.

595
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:44,007
You mean, it was a boy.

596
01:08:52,354 --> 01:08:55,204
- It's me.
- All right, I get it.

597
01:08:55,748 --> 01:08:58,804
I think we just solved a
70-year-old missing person's case.

598
01:08:59,262 --> 01:09:00,592
Who was that?

599
01:09:02,612 --> 01:09:03,708
A long-lost relative.

600
01:09:08,742 --> 01:09:10,350
This is how it starts.

601
01:09:12,845 --> 01:09:14,237
What's going on here, Jamie?

602
01:09:41,114 --> 01:09:42,015
Jamie.

603
01:10:21,437 --> 01:10:23,485
What the...

604
01:10:56,755 --> 01:10:58,056
Mary Shaw?

605
01:11:04,025 --> 01:11:05,367
Mary Shaw?

606
01:11:09,063 --> 01:11:11,139
<i>Clever.</i>

607
01:11:12,656 --> 01:11:13,946
Who's there?

608
01:11:13,946 --> 01:11:15,354
Show yourself!

609
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:16,504
Come out!

610
01:11:18,096 --> 01:11:19,312
What do you want?

611
01:11:24,293 --> 01:11:29,395
<i>To silence all those
who silenced me.</i>

612
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:33,375
Is that why you killed
Michael Ashen?

613
01:11:34,326 --> 01:11:37,718
<i>So hard to construct</i>

614
01:11:37,718 --> 01:11:39,942
<i>the perfect doll.</i>

615
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:45,384
<i>Sometimes you have
to use existing parts.</i>

616
01:11:46,716 --> 01:11:49,148
"I love you, Mommy.
I love you, Mommy."

617
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:50,336
<i>"I love you.</i>

618
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,940
<i>"I love you, Mommy."</i>

619
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,092
Why Lisa?

620
01:11:56,093 --> 01:11:57,523
Why did you take her from me?

621
01:11:59,602 --> 01:12:05,339
<i>Come closer and I'll tell you.</i>

622
01:12:08,318 --> 01:12:10,426
Don't go back there. Don't.

623
01:12:10,788 --> 01:12:12,253
Come on, come on. Don't go.

624
01:12:23,393 --> 01:12:25,485
<i>Come closer.</i>

625
01:12:25,698 --> 01:12:28,615
<i>I'll whisper it to you.</i>

626
01:12:52,861 --> 01:12:55,650
<i>You weren't the last Ashen.</i>

627
01:12:56,254 --> 01:13:01,522
<i>The last Ashen was inside her.</i>

628
01:13:34,434 --> 01:13:35,905
Don't scream.

629
01:13:49,614 --> 01:13:51,330
The doll!

630
01:13:54,252 --> 01:13:55,791
What the hell's
going on here, Jamie?

631
01:13:59,348 --> 01:14:00,303
What's going on?

632
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:01,720
She's living in the dolls!

633
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,970
What?

634
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:03,596
She's living in the dolls!

635
01:14:06,343 --> 01:14:07,206
Destroy the dolls!

636
01:14:07,206 --> 01:14:07,653
I am!

637
01:14:11,117 --> 01:14:12,212
All of the dolls!

638
01:14:24,481 --> 01:14:26,448
Jamie! Run!

639
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,020
Come on!

640
01:17:16,243 --> 01:17:17,445
One left.

641
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:41,477
Henry!

642
01:17:44,703 --> 01:17:45,405
Henry!

643
01:18:06,527 --> 01:18:09,554
Please. Please.

644
01:18:09,975 --> 01:18:10,987
Please.

645
01:18:11,394 --> 01:18:13,171
Please.

646
01:18:13,578 --> 01:18:15,107
Please say

647
01:18:15,574 --> 01:18:18,772
something.

648
01:18:18,772 --> 01:18:20,022
Shit.

649
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:23,376
Marion. Marion, listen to me.
Where is the dummy?

650
01:18:23,786 --> 01:18:24,772
- He took it.
- Who took it?

651
01:18:25,341 --> 01:18:26,471
Who took it?

652
01:18:26,471 --> 01:18:28,240
Mr. Ashen.

653
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,168
Mr...

654
01:18:29,653 --> 01:18:31,638
Marion, my father
is in a wheelchair.

655
01:18:31,993 --> 01:18:33,631
He never leaves the house.

656
01:18:34,192 --> 01:18:38,161
He left this house.
He had the doll.

657
01:18:38,873 --> 01:18:40,812
It was him.

658
01:20:21,645 --> 01:20:23,824
<i>Why did you
bury me, Jamie?</i>

659
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,392
<i>I'm in here!</i>

660
01:22:06,918 --> 01:22:08,165
Dad?

661
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:23,604
I take it I wasn't the easiest
person to get along with in the past,

662
01:22:23,604 --> 01:22:25,153
but I've changed.

663
01:22:25,847 --> 01:22:26,923
Jamie!

664
01:22:26,923 --> 01:22:28,625
<i>Soup! Delicious, too.</i>

665
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:29,951
<i>I'll vouch for that.</i>

666
01:22:34,269 --> 01:22:37,278
<i>Jamie, I can prove
you didn't kill her.</i>

667
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:43,066
<i>Jamie!
So glad to have you home.</i>

668
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,710
Now who's the dummy?

669
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,190
No!

670
01:23:22,562 --> 01:23:24,632
<i>"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw</i>

671
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:27,752
<i>"She had no children,
only dolls</i>

672
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:30,748
<i>"And if you see her
in your dreams</i>

673
01:23:31,033 --> 01:23:35,678
<i>"Be sure you never,
ever, scream"</i>
