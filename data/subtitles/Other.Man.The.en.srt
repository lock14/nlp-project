00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:04,241
TODAY, TOMORROW, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW

00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:07,275
Scherzo in three acts

00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:21,201
THE MAN WITH THE FIVE BALLOONS

4
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:23,765
Screenplay by

5
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:26,377
Directed by

6
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:04,200
The machine, the machine, the machine...

7
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:11,239
It doesn't work.

8
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,796
It must produce 348 pieces per minute.

9
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,760
-They are 340.
-8 less. Why?

10
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:21,161
348, 348, 348...

11
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:28,079
-It has human moves.
-The hell with it! It's not working properly.

12
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:30,841
It must produce 348...

13
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:35,360
It's German, it will make them.

14
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:39,800
Three four eight, three four eight...

15
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:54,282
Mister Mario,
The man with the balloons is in the other room.

16
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:58,276
We need new ideas for Christmas
this year, not balloons.

17
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:02,235
-Do you mind if I inflate it?
-Go ahead. But it's pointless.

18
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:07,757
Hello, Giovanna.
I'll wait for you at my place, as usual.

19
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:09,804
Yes. Good-bye!

20
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,481
-This is traditional advertisement.
-Is it going to blow up?

21
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,080
Noo, it's not going to blow up!

22
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:21,601
One needs great lungs in order
to sell balloons.

23
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:29,955
Blow up! No! Now it's going to blow up,
blow up. Blow up!

24
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:37,038
-Heey, hello!
- Carletto, why don't you go in the other room?

25
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:41,166
-Pretty, huh? -Yes. Do you want to show me
how good you are at inflating it?

26
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:42,801
Hm, no.

27
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:47,358
-Because dad said it's going to blow up.
-Damn you dad, you stole that balloon from me anyway.

28
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,956
If it blows up, it's your fault.

29
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:54,564
Yes, it's my fault. Go ahead and blow,
show me how good you are.

30
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,600
See the little ear is still
flat. Blow, come on!

31
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:05,558
Good job, keep going!
See how it's growing bigger and bigger.

32
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:12,157
You can't even inflate a balloon!
Go away, idiot, go!

33
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:18,402
- (military salute)
-Hello!

34
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:21,925
Where are you going?

35
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,323
I'm here, in the kitchen.

36
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,116
-What are you looking for?
-A coke.

37
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:37,562
-Giovanna, look! -(outside) What is it, a wedding?
-What are you wearing?

38
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:40,839
What's wrong? Work, work!

39
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,117
-Am I chic?
-You know, you're obsessed.

40
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:47,323
What are you doing? Come on, let's go.

41
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:51,236
-You put the balloons in the fridge.
-Right, as If  would do that!

42
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,678
This is the proof that the idiotic son of the porter
put his hands in here.

43
00:03:54,678 --> 00:03:56,121
Now his father won't be able to deny it.

44
00:03:56,367 --> 00:04:00,042
All right, but once we're married I don't want
to see those two dimwits in our house!

45
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:03,799
Come on let's go,
or this is going to ruin my day.

46
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:05,446
How can I inflate it?

47
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:09,606
You're such a littl girl. Straighten your shoulders!
I'm going to force you to wear a corset!

48
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,480
You know, we didn't even say "Good morning"
to each other.

49
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,877
-Good morning.
-Good morning. How are you?

50
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,726
-I'm well. And you?
-I'm all right, thank you.

51
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:18,923
Excuse me, I'll be back.
Vroom!

52
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:24,679
-How was work?
- It was great, we installed the new machines.

53
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,597
Come on, show me.

54
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:34,725
You're cheating! No no, you should bow
in that direction! Et-voila!

55
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:39,040
-Are you out of your mind? There's going to be a bruise
for a week. -Come on, it's the penance.

56
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:42,359
Oh Goodness, this dog!
What did I do to it?

57
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:46,796
Why don't you bring it to your mother?
It's making a mess everywhere!

58
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:51,364
Why instead don't you try to be nice to it...
And you, dumbass, you've seen her for a year...

59
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:53,757
...get smart and say hi to the lady!

60
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,483
Come here, pretty face.

61
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:00,956
No,no, sorry! Don't touch me with your dirty hands.

62
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:05,564
-Wash your hands first. It's gross!
-Oh come on, always this problem.

63
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:08,964
Well yes, go wash your hands.
I told you, I hate it.

64
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,158
Anyway, Furio (the dog) is really clean.

65
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:14,166
Nah! He touches the dog first...

66
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:20,165
Our ceremony... Where should I start?
Let's see...

67
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,882
Oh, these boots are so long!

68
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:27,124
-Come on!
-Red garter?

69
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,517
-Take them off from the feet.
-Whoosh!

70
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:42,445
Oh, come on!

71
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:45,439
It doesn't want to come off.

72
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:51,156
Such cute little feet! Come here.

73
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:56,996
See, I don't mind. Instead, you...
"Wash your hands" (mimicking)!

74
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:03,040
-Remember that you have to call my dad.
-Yes, I'll call him later.

75
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:06,997
Let me rest my head on you pretty belly.

76
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:12,958
No, why?

77
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,645
Your head is heavy.

78
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:21,085
-Listen, but does your dad know that we make love?
-Well he trusts me. -Yea?

79
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:25,680
-And we're going to be married in 20 days anyway.
-Yea, if he trusts you... -So it's ok.

80
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:30,366
Why don't you do me a little favor...

81
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,723
-Let me see it for a second...
-What?

82
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:34,719
You know what.

83
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:40,718
- Do you hear? Hmm, come on.
-No, I don't like that.

84
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:42,919
Come on!

85
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:47,241
-Come on!
-Ok, but you stay there, and don't move.

86
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,318
Ok, I won't move.

87
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:52,237
-Do you promise?
-I promise.

88
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:56,724
Come on, hurry up, I can't wait all day!

89
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:59,880
Aren't you my lover,
then come on, move!

90
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,845
Do your thing!

91
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:04,684
It's an order!

92
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:10,277
You're really obsessed.

93
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:15,440
The show begins!

94
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,599
-Stay there and don't move, ok?
-I promise.

95
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:23,406
I'll do it but this is not cool.

96
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,444
Lower the curtain!

97
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:39,278
At least you could watch!

98
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:41,756
I'm doing all this for you,
and you inflate your balloon?!?

99
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:44,646
But I blow with my mouth,
And I watch with my eyes.

100
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:46,042
-Right...
-Keep going.

101
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,084
The hell with it!

102
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:54,245
It's the last time I do that.
Stop it with this balloon!

103
00:07:55,727 --> 00:08:00,403
It's strange. I started to blow, and now
I don't want to stop.

104
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,524
But I can't keep going forever.
What do you say, should I continue?

105
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:06,037
I say that you stop it.
Come one, you're not continuing.

106
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,437
Here goes the sweater!

107
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,122
I'm going to blow it up for love.

108
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:18,718
I'm going to blow it in your honor.
Are you happy?

109
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,241
Do it.

110
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:39,159
Poor balloon.

111
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,725
Come here.

112
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:56,486
Who should I give this balloon to, now?

113
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:00,202
Let's give it to the little angel.

114
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:12,162
-If one starts thinking...
-You ahve the whole week to think.

115
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:15,958
It seems a silly thing,
but it's actually a problem.

116
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:21,439
-What? - When you reach a certain point, you don't
know if there will be room for more air.

117
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:25,564
-Hm, so?
-So you don't know when to stop.

118
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:29,965
-Stop what?
-To blow. -Idiot.

119
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,917
-Do you want some?
-No, thanks.

120
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:39,396
-What are you thinking about?
-Nothing.

121
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:45,119
How can you eat condensed milk like that!
that should be used for cappuccino.

122
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:48,040
Look here, it looks like
a battlefield.

123
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:52,362
-Look at this mess!
-Read this.

124
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:57,827
"Stupid".
Oh, thank you.

125
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,923
You know what I''m going to do with your "stupid"?
I'm going to eat it!

126
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,796
It tickles!

127
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:16,161
So you wrote "stupid", hm?

128
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:20,277
-Then, write something else.
-What?

129
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:23,997
I don't know... something you
think about me.

130
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:27,360
Wait.

131
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:44,638
-Big stup...
-And I'm going to eat your "big stupid" too.

132
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:59,359
It's good.

133
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:02,799
What are you looking at?

134
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:11,526
...41, 42, 43, 44...

135
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:15,362
...45, 46, 47, 48, 49...

136
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:19,686
...50, 51, 52, 53...

137
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:24,202
...54, 55, 56, 57.

138
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:38,561
I brought you some whisky.
And the ice.

139
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,997
How is it going with the pump?

140
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:46,325
Well, I'm happy.
Have you seen? Look!

141
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:51,483
-Hey, look! -Yes.
-See, ice! Pretty, huh?

142
00:11:52,687 --> 00:11:56,362
-Look, it looks like crystal!
-Stop it, come on.

143
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:03,366
How many ice cubes do you want?
Two, three, four, five, six?

144
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:08,556
Listen, Giovanna, don't you understand?
Leave me alone for a second.

145
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,561
We were together all afternoon,
we made love.

146
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:15,919
We spoke until now.
Now let me do this work in peace.

147
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,525
I came to the end of it, and I found out
that with the pump, one can't make a mistake

148
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,638
because it's mathematic, do you understand?

149
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:24,680
It's the same reason that
Germans keep going on.

150
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:28,163
They're rational, mathematic.
And tenacious.

151
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:32,839
Go in the other room.
Can't you go watch tv for a bit.

152
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:35,721
Please go.

153
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:39,004
During the week I have to wait
because you work.

154
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:42,279
I can't go out with anybody,
because you're jealous.

155
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:45,963
And on Saturday I come to see you to
have fun, and be with you.

156
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,240
And you tell me to go
watch tv!

157
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:54,561
-Fine. Like a saint, I'll go watch tv.
-Yes, go go.

158
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:17,203
Here's to us, you old lion!

159
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:18,283
77, 78...

160
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:25,360
...79, 80...

161
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,606
- Where are you going?
-I'll be right back. -Tell me where you are going!

162
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:13,555
-I'll be right back, watch tv!
-Please, tell me where you're going!

163
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:20,801
You, come here!

164
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:28,605
Why did you put the balloons in the fridge?
Damn you!

165
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:53,485
Come on, tell me something!

166
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,196
Touch here!

167
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:59,640
I told you, these things cannot be solved empirically,
they must be analyzed scientifically.

168
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:02,601
But you are an engineer.
Give me some technical advice!

169
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:06,038
Right, I'm going to give you technical advice,
on Saturday afternoon while I'm getting a massage!

170
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:09,166
-Look, I'll blow some more.
-Now it's going to blow up!

171
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:13,559
-That's precisely what I wanna find out. Touch here!
-How annoying...

172
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:16,039
I can blow more.

173
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:20,438
-Keep your hands on it! Tell me
if I can blow more.

174
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:24,036
Damn it, what kind of engineer are you??

175
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,959
All done.

176
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:30,599
What a day!

177
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:33,561
Little poetic cloud.

178
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,880
-Get a massage, too.
-No, I don't feel like it today.

179
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:43,763
-Tell me what you think.
-(lady,in japanese) Good-bye. -Good-bye.

180
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:52,237
Listen up, I'm not a kid, I'm an engineer, I don't want
to stay here and play with balloons.

181
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:56,161
All right, you're an engineer, I'm an industrialist and
I have a checkbook. How much do you want?

182
00:15:56,367 --> 00:16:01,236
Nothing. Since you decided to break "my
balloons", I'll give you advice...

183
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:04,399
-..for free. Ok?
-Ok, good.

184
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:06,479
Ok, listen.

185
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:10,482
Every result derives
from a set of proofs.

186
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:15,397
You want to know the breaking point of the balloon.
Where? In what place?

187
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:19,682
For example, the pressure in this room is
very different from the massage room.

188
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:22,196
-Good evening.
-Good evening, professor.

189
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:25,445
-Have you had your massage?
-Yes. -Good, well done.

190
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:29,642
Mr. Mario, careful with the carpet.
Your shoes!

191
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:34,202
See, the pressure in that room is
again different from this one...

192
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,165
Wait a second!

193
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:43,521
Here, since the sauna is close,
the humidity is also different.

194
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:46,958
So, you want to know the
breaking point of the balloon.

195
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:51,206
But you have to tell me if you wanna know it
here, there or over there. Do you understand?

196
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:55,560
-I don't know... in the middle! -In the middle...
-Come on, you know what I mean.

197
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:59,965
Anyway, now I gave you the examples
of humidity and pressure.

198
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:03,404
But there 100.000 other elements
that determine the result.

199
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:08,045
Some, you can assign from the beginning,
but some are unpredictable.

200
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,444
The hell with you, talking about unpredictable...

201
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,527
There are always unpredictable elements.

202
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:17,044
-The door!
-Hey, Mario! How are you?

203
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,479
Well, you have to know that this man here
came with a balloon to inflate.

204
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:25,203
If the people at the bank saw him,
they'd take the balloon away.

205
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:27,881
Anyhow... what is precisely that you want to know?

206
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:30,999
Get to the point...
You didn't understand anything.

207
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,718
And the audience here doesn't really
intimidate me.

208
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:38,766
I asked something really simple,
which will make you laugh.

209
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:42,676
I just wanna know,
how much I can inflate this balloon.

210
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:47,438
Because if I stop blowing and there's still
room left inside, I failed.

211
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:51,521
-Do you understand?
-Why don't you take your hat off?

212
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:56,278
So, the problem is simple, yet also
very importante for me.

213
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,520
Because if I can't make it,
I'm a failure, inside.

214
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:04,682
Since you don't have any moral qualms
in yourselves, you're all jerks. Understood?

215
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:21,716
Hello, listen wait for me, I'm
coming there. Wait, come on!

216
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:23,846
Are you mad?

217
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,642
Wait, I'll be there soon, I'll bring you a surprise.
Stay there, ok?

218
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:36,205
Don't worry, Sir, this is the best of
our meat from Lomellina.

219
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:40,682
Excuse me.

220
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,445
-Have you been helped, Sir?
-Thanks, I'd like a truffle.

221
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:48,043
They're truly beautiful. Here, smell this.

222
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:53,881
-Didn't you wet them too much?
-Oh, no, here we don't do that.

223
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:57,283
White from Alma, really fresh.

224
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:01,996
-Should I wrap it, Sir?
-Yes. -Anything else?

225
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:05,120
No, I'll take a look around.

226
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,641
-Can I help you, Sir?
-Good evening.

227
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:12,118
Listen, do people always eat this much?

228
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:14,682
Of course they do!
They eat and they forget everything.

229
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:17,805
-Much better than cocaine!
-Really? Well then, let's eat.

230
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:22,637
-What do you have that is good?
-Well If i had to pick, we have this great risotto...

231
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:23,047
- Pøipravte mi malou hostinu.
- Je lahùdkové.

232
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:26,119
-Pick me a good dinner.
-This risotto is great.

233
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:29,125
Hm, before I get home it'll become like glue.

234
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,755
But Sir, we have a special,
thermal wrapping.

235
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,645
Really? Then, let's
get the risotto!

236
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,805
Dinner for two?

237
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:47,197
I brought so much stuff,
we'll have a great dinner!

238
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:52,925
Let's eat! Can you smell the truffle?
Smell here!

239
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:58,001
Truffle, turkey, canape,
champagne! Everything you want!

240
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:01,159
It's you and I, here, alone.
Aren't you happy?

241
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,922
An hour and a half to go to buy food?

242
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:07,999
I was nervous, I needed to get some fresh air.
Let me stay here.

243
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:13,400
-What do you want?
-I wanna stay here. Please?

244
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:38,436
Did we make up?
Say yes...

245
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:46,083
-No! -Yes!
-No! -Yes!

246
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:54,475
I don't know how to live without you.
You have to bear with me.

247
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,319
Otherwise I can't...
Do you love me?

248
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:04,682
-How much? -yes.
-But how much?

249
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:08,484
-Very much.
-Very, very much.

250
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:12,037
Sweet, sweet love.

251
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:17,245
If you can't stand me anymore,
I can't do anything anymore...

252
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:20,161
You understand that, right?

253
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:24,239
Take off your clothes.

254
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,725
Take off your clothes.

255
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:34,364
I wanna make love.

256
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:49,203
Furio...!

257
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:55,443
Do you like it?

258
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:47,920
Stop it!

259
00:23:50,927 --> 00:23:53,316
This was the right time!

260
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:58,117
You jerk! I'm going to kill you!

261
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:01,885
I'm going to crack your head open!
Don't laugh!

262
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:06,837
I'm an inch from your nose!
An inch!

263
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:10,045
-You're out of your mind. -Who's out of their mind?
Look here! Look if I'm crazy!

264
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:19,915
I have control over my actions!
I'm going to cut your head off! Understood?

265
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:25,922
You never smoke. How come you're smoking now?
That's why you were waiting calmly, you're a sadist!

266
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:29,597
I'm going to stick a finger up your nose,
and break it down!

267
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:33,359
Don't laugh! I'm going to kill you!

268
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:36,636
Tell me I'm crazy because I want to think...

269
00:24:36,636 --> 00:24:39,844
...because I want to understand, say it!
Jen to øekni!

270
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:43,961
-Ohh, stop it, you're annoying!
-Aaaah, I'm annoying!

271
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,727
-(Giovanna) You're totally crazy.

272
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,240
Madam,
you stop at the object itself.

273
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,921
Try to understand the meaning.

274
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:59,004
Go away, madam.

275
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,839
I'm an idiot!

276
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:05,684
-To stay here, and wait for you, and bear with you.
-I don't need you as a wife.

277
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:07,326
GO AWAY!

278
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:12,238
I'm going to tell you gently, Madam.
Go, go to your dad who trusts you. Go.

279
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,796
-I have to get my clothes.
-Sure, go ahead.

280
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,998
-And my boots, too.
-Sure! I'll leave the door open.

281
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:19,323
-I wonder how I could make love to you!
You disgust me!

282
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:21,722
You're a monster and a selfish man.

283
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:25,886
That's what you are.
But I'm sick of this situation.

284
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:30,999
You stay here alone with your candies,
your dog, your money.

285
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,518
Your understanding...
What do you want to understand, anyway?

286
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:51,363
Do you like it? Later.

287
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:54,475
Now the truffle. 9000 lira!
(around 7 dollars)

288
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:59,879
500, 1000, 1500...

289
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:03,515
...2000, 2500...

290
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:09,963
...3000, 3500, 4000.
I'll stop, or my liver will hurt.

291
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:19,444
I need to stay calm.
I should follow your example.

292
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:22,445
The truth is, you're
already a corpse.

293
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:28,036
Moet Chandon, brut, year 1944.

294
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:32,839
That might be a lie.
The Germans stole everything.

295
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:36,763
Slowly, scientifically.

296
00:26:43,127 --> 00:26:48,155
Let's pour it. The foam...
I like the foam.

297
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,758
To you!

298
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,801
Do you want the balloon?
I'll give it to you.

299
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:05,767
In your face!

300
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:52,326
He had to fall right on my car, that idiot.
Damn it.

301
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,518
How am I going to fix this now...

302
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:01,923
Let me move, please!

303
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:05,561
Even the slipper...
You can keep your slipper!

304
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:10,444
Excuse me, let me through.
Nobody says anything to this guy...

305
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:14,925
You only worry about your car.
A man fell from above, he might die, this poor guy.

306
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:17,966
-Who are you? The Police?
-Of course not!

307
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:20,038
You only worry about your car.
In the end, this is a man...

308
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:21,601
-This is my car!
-I know that.

309
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:23,644
-Then worry about your own car!
-Be a civil person!

310
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,407
-I didn't tell him to throw himself out of the window.
-Be human, it's a man after all...

311
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:28,478
-Do you have a car?
-Yes, I do.

312
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:31,247
So if I come here and start doing this on your car...

313
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,165
But the man can be dead!

314
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:36,240
So? Who is dead stays down,
who is alive accepts that.

315
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,806
-Go away!
-This is ridiculous!

-Please, can you check if there's a message for me?

321
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:47,396
My name is Michele Profili.

322
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:57,322
-No Sir, no messages.
-Thank you.

-Can I have a telephone coin, please.
-Sure, in a moment.

324
00:31:11,647 --> 00:31:13,763
Professor, can I ask
you some questions?

325
00:31:13,763 --> 00:31:15,599
Look, i wouldn't know  what
to tell you.

326
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,275
Is it true that you have been
nominated for the Nobel prize for Physics?

327
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:19,966
I don't think so,
I don't know...

328
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:23,284
-Have you been away from Italy for long?
-Twelve years. But now let me go, please.

329
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:27,242
-How long are you staying?
-Look, I just came here for a short break, to rest.

330
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:29,358
Don't ruin my holidays from the beginning, please.

331
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,405
Thank you Professor, and I am sorry.

332
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:41,918
Carmelina, I'll get it.

333
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:48,082
I'm coming! Hello?

334
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,485
Hello, is that Rossi's house?

335
00:31:50,967 --> 00:31:53,083
-Yes. -Are you Mrs. Rossi?
-Yes, that's me.

336
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:56,876
-I am Michele Profili. -Oh, Professor, welcome!
What a pleasure to have you here!

337
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:01,246
Arturo told me so much about you!
Come whenever you like, here all is ready!

338
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:06,403
Oh ok, but Arturo told me he would come to pick me
up at Fiumicino airport. But I don't see him.

339
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:11,079
Really? I'm worried, too.
This morning, when he went out, he looked so upset.

340
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:12,842
Upset? Why's that?

341
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:17,001
He shot me.
Ooh, so I'll wait for you. See you later!

342
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,441
Good, good.

343
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:21,679
Mrs. Rossi?!? Hello!

344
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:24,967
Michele, finally! How are you?

345
00:32:25,524 --> 00:32:28,804
-I'm well...
-Sorry that I'm late, I found some traffic.

346
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:32,283
Living in Rome is becoming impossible.
Come, my car is outside.

347
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:40,601
I'm really sorry.

348
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:42,640
-Were you scared?
-No, no.

349
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:45,526
With your nervous breakdown...

350
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:47,843
-Did you cure it well?
-Yes, indeed.

351
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:49,844
I was in a clinic for a month.

352
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:52,800
-What did they do to you?
-Sleep therapy.

353
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:55,475
That sounds relaxing.
And those tics you had?

354
00:32:56,247 --> 00:32:57,566
Oh, they're gone.

355
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:01,005
That's good.
You look thinner.

356
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,119
But you'll get better.

357
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,918
I'm really happy to hear that you're fine.

358
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:09,364
Now it's important that you rest well,
before starting that series of conferences.

359
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:13,037
You'll see, before leaving my house,
you'll have to call the tailor!

360
00:33:13,247 --> 00:33:15,886
-The tailor?
-Yes, you'll need new clothes!

361
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:18,317
I'll make you become like this, look...

362
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:25,516
Listen, I don't want to bother you.
Maybe it's better if I stay in a hotel.

363
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:28,082
Are you kiddind?
We're childhood friends!

364
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:31,080
Yes but... now it's different.
You're married now.

365
00:33:31,647 --> 00:33:34,366
Oh, now that you reminded me!
I have to stop for a second.

366
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:36,483
-Do you mind?
-No, go ahead.

367
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:46,201
WEAPONS

368
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:53,080
Here is the revolver which was jammed,
and this is the gun you ordered.

369
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,205
Thank you. I'll be back to pay the bill.

370
00:33:55,487 --> 00:33:58,206
-The bullets!
-Oh, thanks. Good-bye.

371
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:05,923
I'm sorry. Let's go.

372
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:19,322
-Do you like strawberries?
-Very much, thanks.

373
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:22,958
Oh thank God.
They're my husband's favorite!

374
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:25,926
My big sweet cat.

375
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:29,682
Meow, meow. Kitty, I'm your cat.

376
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:43,444
Listen up, where did you
put that magazine I gave you?

377
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:46,878
-In our bedroom.
-There's a great article about you.

378
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:50,358
It says that next year you'll be nominated
for the Nobel prize. Did you know?

379
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:52,120
Well yes, they told me.

380
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:54,562
A great scientist like you would surely deserve it.

381
00:34:55,007 --> 00:34:58,317
Thanks, but it's not official yet.

382
00:34:58,607 --> 00:35:01,326
I even thought that they
were joking.

383
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,841
Right...

384
00:35:04,007 --> 00:35:06,282
Arturo, why don't you ask him about tonight?

385
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:08,644
Right. What are we doing tonight?

386
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:12,960
I couldn't plan anything, because I didn't know
whether you were tired or not...

387
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,562
My beautiful cat takes care of everything!

388
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:20,797
My kitty!
You're my kitty, right?

389
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:29,917
Yes, I'm a little tired!
You know, the trip, and everything else..

390
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:33,566
And tomorrow I'd like to visit
my sister in Naples.

391
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:35,120
It's been a long time since I've seen her.

392
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:37,557
And of course now there are also nephews and nieces.

393
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:39,565
Be careful!

394
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,686
I even warned you!

395
00:35:42,327 --> 00:35:45,205
-That's nothing, really.
-I'm really sorry.

396
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:48,879
-What are you doing? With a knife? Are you crazy?
-With the blade, it's better.

397
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:53,319
-Yea right, so the stain gets even worse.
-What are you talking about, you can barely see it.

398
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,196
Right, Michele?

399
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,322
Yes, sure...

400
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:59,240
What do you expect, that he says it's visible?
He's a guest!

401
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:01,882
The stain is there and it's evident!

402
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:05,798
Well so you tell me, what should I do?
Should I hang myself?

403
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:09,525
Ok I made a mistake,
let's toast to that.

404
00:36:09,525 --> 00:36:11,882
Now with some wine you think you fixed it?

405
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,566
I'll give you mine.

406
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:18,239
Of course, since I gave it to you. You hated it from
day one, you just couldn't wait to get rid of it.

407
00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:20,836
Oh yes that's true, you gave this to me.

408
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:23,278
You didn't even remember.

409
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:26,087
DOn't make such a scene, come on.
Where is the baby powder?

410
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:30,440
In this house we buy tons of baby powder.
A little bit of attention would be enough.

411
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,400
Yesterday french fries, today cream,
tomorrow pasta with meatsauce...

412
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:34,881
It's so difficult to take care of him.

413
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:38,318
But this is a wife's fate.

414
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:41,923
-A husband instead has the office, his business...
-Oh, the office, business...

415
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:46,326
But these are things for serious people!
But you? What do you do?

416
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:49,758
You sit there all day, drawing,
then you come home and you start giving orders!

417
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,326
Bring me this, bring me that!

418
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:53,483
-Just stop it.
-You're exaggerating now. Stop it!

419
00:36:53,727 --> 00:36:57,561
You don't like to hear the truth, huh?
"You're exaggerating no, stop it" - whatever!

420
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:01,880
Dorotea, Arturo, really, calm down.

421
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:04,877
She really gets on my nerves.

422
00:37:05,487 --> 00:37:07,637
-Come on, Dorotea, where do you keep the baby powder?
-Go look for it.

423
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:10,839
-Dorotea, stop it.
-Come on, be nice...

424
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:14,961
-You shut up, don't touch me! What are you going
to do if I don't stop it, huh? -Don't provoke me.

425
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:19,042
-Let's not cross certain boundaries...
-What are you doing?

426
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:23,485
Let me go, Michele!
This is the time to end this once and for all.

427
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:27,846
-Right, let's end this once and for all!
-This time you won't escape.

428
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,484
-Oh my God! Help!
- Arturo, please don't do it!

429
00:37:31,484 --> 00:37:33,558
Get out of the way, Michele.

430
00:37:38,887 --> 00:37:40,639
Quick! This way!

431
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:47,526
There he is!

432
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:07,680
-Aren't there any keys in this house?!?
-I don't know, but I'm so scared!

433
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,443
There he is! Let's run!

434
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:37,356
This way!

435
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:52,836
Freeze!

436
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:57,716
-No, no!
-Don't shoot!

437
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:06,000
Here are the smelling salts.

438
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:48,482
I survived this time, too.

439
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,596
I wonder what saint protects me.

440
00:39:58,607 --> 00:39:59,835
Thank you.

441
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,395
How much sugar?

442
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:18,198
You know, just one spoon, better if it's too bitter.

443
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:39,685
-Kitty...
-My cat.

444
00:40:43,647 --> 00:40:44,875
You're bad.

445
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:52,317
You always get mad so easily.
1,2,3,4... And you shoot.

446
00:40:58,087 --> 00:41:01,238
Dorotea really loves her big cat.

447
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:05,201
Do the cat. Come on.

448
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:13,646
-I'm a cat... purr.
-Yes, yes. -Purrr.

449
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:20,726
Why the hell did I come here?
I could have stayed in a hotel...

450
00:41:21,207 --> 00:41:22,925
It would have been great.

451
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:26,796
(Arturo) -Kitty, can you
stop reading and we turn the light off?

452
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,397
-Thanks God.
(Arturo) -Tomorrow I have so much to do.

453
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:37,927
(Arturo) -Please put the book down.
Kitty, put the book down!

454
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:40,477
(Dorotea) -Don't be annoying. Uff!

455
00:41:41,607 --> 00:41:44,440
(Arturo) -Put that book down! At this time,
we should sleep.

456
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:47,596
(Dorotea) -No, leave me alone, dictator!

457
00:41:48,487 --> 00:41:51,797
(Arturo) -I said put the book down!!
(Dorotea) -I'm not going to put the book down!!

458
00:41:52,407 --> 00:41:55,205
(Arturo) -Ouch!!
(Dorotea) -Ha ha, you hurt yourself! Too bad!

459
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:59,442
(Arturo) -That's enough, give me that book!!

460
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:33,400
Oh God...

461
00:43:07,047 --> 00:43:10,119
-Aah! Who's that?
-Shh! Arturo has the gun.

462
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:12,562
A gun...

463
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:47,200
-Have you ever noticed that the gun is loaded with blanks?
-Of course it is.

464
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:50,035
But from time to time he uses real bullets!

465
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:51,806
Russian roulette!

466
00:43:59,447 --> 00:44:00,721
Here, take it.

467
00:44:05,887 --> 00:44:10,005
-Dorotea, what are we doing here?
-Not what you're thinking.

468
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:13,486
Here he is!

469
00:44:18,327 --> 00:44:20,363
Arturo, we didn't do anything!

470
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:23,477
I know. Now get out of the way.

471
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:27,198
-Yes, but how?
-Dorotea, put that book down! -No!

472
00:44:27,407 --> 00:44:30,717
-Do it while I'm being nice.
-No, no! -Then you know what's going to happen.

473
00:44:31,247 --> 00:44:33,886
Put down that gun,
think about it!

474
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:36,965
Assassin! Help!

475
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:51,916
Michele! What's wrong?

476
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:01,075
Damn it!

477
00:45:12,887 --> 00:45:16,197
Michele? What are you doing?
Where do you want to go?

478
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:19,684
Where? To denounce you, you murderer!

479
00:45:20,127 --> 00:45:21,560
-Who, me?
-Yes, you!

480
00:45:22,007 --> 00:45:25,238
Now Dorotea is lying in my bed in
a bloodbath!

481
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:27,597
How does this open?!?

482
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:30,558
Be quiet, you're going to wake up
the whole building!

483
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:34,237
-Murderer!
-What murderer? It's a gun loaded with blanks!

484
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:38,562
-But there's a real bullet in there!
-Of course not, that's what I tell Dorotea!

485
00:45:38,807 --> 00:45:41,401
-It's only loaded with blanks!
-Really?

486
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:43,444
Come one, come upstairs.

487
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:45,558
You saw how difficult is my wife.

488
00:45:45,558 --> 00:45:48,799
I couldn't stand her anymore. What could I do?
I didn't want to kick her out.

489
00:45:48,799 --> 00:45:51,640
One day I found a pistol with blanks
in my pocket.

490
00:45:51,887 --> 00:45:53,081
I shot her.

491
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:56,439
From that moment she turned into another person.
Sweet, docile, yielding.

492
00:45:56,727 --> 00:46:00,356
So I understood that, in order to live in peace,
one must shoot his wife!

493
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:04,476
But couldn't you tell me in advance?
My nerves are still so weak.

494
00:46:04,807 --> 00:46:08,083
You're right, but I thought I write you about that.
It's been a year already.

495
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:11,359
But what about the neighbors?
Don't they complain?

496
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:15,282
Heh, in the beginning it was a mess.
The porter, the neighbors...

497
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:18,127
Then I explained to them
and they understood.

498
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,359
Actually, many people followed my example.
And they still thank me.

499
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,643
-Really? -Sure, this system is spreading,
I get letters everyday.

500
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:27,920
Tons of letters.
Even from abroad now.

501
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:30,556
-Big cat...
-Sweetheart!

502
00:46:31,007 --> 00:46:34,238
What are you doing down there?
You'll catch a cold.

503
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:37,562
Come upstairs, I'll make you a hot chocolate.

504
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:40,605
Ok love, we'll be right there!

505
00:46:41,327 --> 00:46:42,726
See? Let's go.

506
00:46:50,927 --> 00:46:53,566
-What is it?
-That's Dr. Bellis, on the second floor.

507
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:56,918
Great man, surgeon.
Very beautiful wife.

508
00:46:56,918 --> 00:47:00,602
We hang out quite often.
They come to our house, we go to theirs...

509
00:47:00,807 --> 00:47:03,480
Go ahead.
He was the first to follow me with this new system.

510
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:14,558
Listen, I thought about what happened last night.
It's a great idea, tremendous.

511
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:18,285
Who doesn't wish for a sweet, quiet,
understanding wife?

512
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,404
And you could perfect your system.

513
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:27,479
We would need a bullet with...
talcum powder, poppy, bromide...

514
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:29,883
...and a bit of Spanish fly, that would be good.

515
00:47:30,207 --> 00:47:31,925
Let's talk about this in the car.

516
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:35,716
I also thought that the product could be sold on the international market with a great name:

517
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:38,925
"The bullet of happiness"!
It would sell like crazy in America.

518
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:40,522
Arturo!

519
00:47:40,847 --> 00:47:44,283
Since Michele is going to Naples, I called mom and I told her
we would go there for breakfast.

520
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:47,285
I'm going to Naples with him.
Didn't I tell you?

521
00:47:47,487 --> 00:47:49,045
Yes, he's coming with me.

522
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:52,478
-You're going away?
-I'll be back soon, it will take only half a day.

523
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:54,446
Oh no!

524
00:47:56,967 --> 00:48:01,040
You can't do this to my mother!
You're not going to Naples!

525
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:13,122
-Dorotea give me the car keys.
-No, I won't.

526
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:16,119
Shoot her and let's go, it's late.

527
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:19,877
No, the arguement must start out nicely, and then grow
worse and worse. Don't laugh please!

528
00:48:21,047 --> 00:48:23,481
Make up your mind! Michele, let's go.

529
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,001
Stop!

530
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:31,601
If you come any closer, I'm going
to toss the keys!

531
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:33,439
And I'm goign to shoot you.

532
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:38,480
Arturo, come on, what are you doing?

533
00:48:39,927 --> 00:48:42,646
You know you're going to jail? (laughs)

534
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:00,762
But that was a real bullet, Arturo!

535
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:03,999
Oh right, from time to time I put a real bullet in,
or she won't believe me anymore!

536
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:05,646
But I aim too low.

537
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,082
Excuse me one moment.

538
00:49:14,687 --> 00:49:21,365
Aren't you exaggerating?
She didn't really do anything.

539
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:25,277
Not now. But tonight when I'm back,
I'll be tired and I want to sleep.

540
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:26,602
So it's in advance?

541
00:49:28,127 --> 00:49:30,641
-Put it away, ok?
-Sure, Doctor.

542
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:37,926
Oh, this is the lawyer D'Ambrosio.
He hasn't shot for a while!

543
00:49:40,567 --> 00:49:43,957
Hah, this is Sorrini.
He has a terrible wife.

544
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:51,887
-Who was this?
-I don't know, it must be a new one. I told you, it's popular.

545
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:14,525
Wow, it must be a bad day.

546
00:50:14,927 --> 00:50:17,600
Well, at this time all the husband are going out.

547
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:20,116
-I understand: the "rush hour"!
-Yes.

548
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,804
"THE BLOND WIFE"

549
00:51:33,527 --> 00:51:35,563
Synopsis by

550
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:38,807
Screenplay by

551
00:51:42,247 --> 00:51:43,497
directed by

552
00:51:56,007 --> 00:51:57,507
Pepita, sit down love.
Help me.

553
00:52:06,447 --> 00:52:08,039
Here, one moment please.

554
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:10,437
-I'll get out.
(something not in Italian)

555
00:52:11,607 --> 00:52:13,723
Pepita, sit down sweetheart.

556
00:52:17,887 --> 00:52:20,765
I have to get out. One moment please!

557
00:52:32,487 --> 00:52:34,443
Leave us alone! Pepita!

558
00:53:46,647 --> 00:53:49,559
Sweetheart, I'm leaving. A little kiss?

559
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:53,918
-The money...
-Money? But I gave you some yesterday.

560
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:58,646
-Tailor, hairdresser...
-Fine, fine.

561
00:53:59,127 --> 00:54:03,564
-Car insurance, make-up...
-I'll put it here, ok? Bye!

562
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:07,038
Nourishing cream, hydrating cream...

563
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:20,638
Italy - very expensive. (foreign accent)

564
00:54:23,287 --> 00:54:27,997
-Can you lend me 4 million (lira)?
-Of course. -Thanks.

565
00:54:35,247 --> 00:54:37,886
Nice, smooth  money.

566
00:54:38,287 --> 00:54:42,644
So, 4 million  and 2 earlier,
I owe you 6 million.

567
00:54:43,007 --> 00:54:44,281
Take your time.

568
00:54:44,727 --> 00:54:47,878
Instead, you still owe me 1500 lira for the movie theater,
from last week.

569
00:54:49,647 --> 00:54:50,796
Take your time.

570
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:10,566
Damn it! She's always sleeping.
How can I make the bed?

571
00:55:12,207 --> 00:55:15,756
She's always sleeping, it's incredible.

572
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,756
Listen, since you've read Freud,
what can this mean?

573
00:55:19,967 --> 00:55:22,356
I really hate American cars.

574
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:26,285
It's a transference.
The car, is your wife.

575
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:30,276
-But she was in the dream, too.
-But she was one with the car.

576
00:55:31,007 --> 00:55:34,477
See, in your subconscious,
Pepita is like an American car.

577
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:37,361
Very beautiful, but cumbersome.

578
00:55:37,647 --> 00:55:42,118
Yes, and like American cars,
Pepita "consumes" way too much.

579
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:50,800
Good morning.

580
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:55,806
Look over there!

581
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:03,158
-Who's that?
-That's Ali Bennali. He was on the newspaper, too.

582
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:06,837
He has two floors at the Hilton,
and 40 wives.

583
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:11,480
-But there are only 5.
-Well he must have brought only a delegation.

584
00:56:13,247 --> 00:56:14,362
Good morning.

585
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:27,166
40 wives! If you think that Pepita alone
costs me 150,000 lira per month.

586
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:33,526
And he's a prince, so presents, jewels...
Let's say 200,000 each wife.

587
00:56:33,847 --> 00:56:36,236
-At the least.
-That's 8 million every month.

588
00:56:36,236 --> 00:56:39,240
- Rastrelli!
-Yes, director.

589
00:56:39,447 --> 00:56:42,041
Bring 8 million here immediately.

590
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:44,641
I'll be right there.

591
00:56:55,127 --> 00:56:59,678
Pepito! Here you are!
How are you love?

592
00:57:00,327 --> 00:57:01,965
You're home already?

593
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:05,806
Look at what you've done!

594
00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:08,846
I'm sorry. What's for dinner?

595
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:16,117
-Is there anything good in the kitchen?
-Spaghetti bolognese and rice with peas.

596
00:57:16,367 --> 00:57:19,643
That's... original, two first courses.

597
00:57:19,967 --> 00:57:24,961
Can you open them by yourself? I still have to shower.
Such a bad day, today...

598
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:30,721
Well she's surely a bit American.

599
00:57:55,207 --> 00:57:56,560
Are you done?

600
00:57:59,607 --> 00:58:01,677
Leave it to me, I'll do it.

601
00:58:05,087 --> 00:58:06,805
-Was it good?
-Yes.

602
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:09,802
-Were the spaghetti good?
-Yes, dear, they were great.

603
00:58:09,802 --> 00:58:11,366
That's good.

604
00:58:18,687 --> 00:58:21,406
He must be such a nice guy.

605
00:58:23,007 --> 00:58:25,316
He must be a really great man.

606
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:29,241
Most importantly, he must be so rich.

607
00:58:29,647 --> 00:58:35,483
And then, he's a real aristocrat.
Of course, a real prince...

608
00:58:35,483 --> 00:58:38,798
I don't know, he passed by for a moment,
I barely saw him.

609
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:41,875
I know you were looking at the wives.

610
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:44,886
People say that those are the most beautiful
blondes in the world.

611
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:47,846
-Why blond?
-Didn't you read?

612
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:48,967
It's written... here.

613
00:58:53,087 --> 00:58:57,683
His main activity is to travel the world to buy wives.

614
00:58:58,127 --> 00:59:02,200
As long as they're blond and beautiful,
he doesn't care about the price.

615
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:05,365
What do you mean, "buy"?
Where?

616
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,437
Well, from whoever has what he wants.

617
00:59:08,887 --> 00:59:11,720
When he sees a blond woman,
he pays and buys her.

618
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:15,044
He wanted to buy Kim Novak,
he offered 500 million!

619
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,642
It's true! It's all written there.

620
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:01,838
Architect!

621
01:00:02,407 --> 01:00:04,637
Tell me, accountant Gasparri!

622
01:00:07,607 --> 01:00:09,677
Would you sell your wife?

623
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:16,039
Are you out of your mind?
Me, selling my wife? I'd rather be poor!

624
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:21,200
Ha ha, you huh? Always with these
strange thoughts.

625
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:25,357
Oh Madam I apologize, I didn't see you.
Good evening.

626
01:00:33,207 --> 01:00:35,846
Why, did you hear of any offer?

627
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:38,278
No, I was just saying.

628
01:00:41,487 --> 01:00:46,003
-They take....so much out of us, right?

629
01:00:47,087 --> 01:00:53,435
When I come home at night, I'm tired.
But she plays one of her discs and...

630
01:00:55,287 --> 01:00:56,720
...can you hear?

631
01:00:56,967 --> 01:01:00,004
And then she starts to bite her hair.

632
01:01:00,687 --> 01:01:05,044
And that's the sign of her...libido, let's say.

633
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:09,841
Erminia too, you know.
She punches me here...

634
01:01:10,327 --> 01:01:15,276
And it hurts, you know, because she hits
exactly my muscle...

635
01:01:15,847 --> 01:01:17,678
And that means that...

636
01:01:19,887 --> 01:01:21,320
Ouch!

637
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:24,439
-Accountant.
-Good night.

638
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:30,118
And sleep well!

639
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,956
-Honey!
-Yes, dear.

640
01:01:44,127 --> 01:01:44,877
Ok.

641
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:07,638
-Can I take the picture?
-No, wait a second!

642
01:02:08,047 --> 01:02:10,686
Sweetheart, you must be smoother.

643
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,641
Straighten your leg, try to be sensual.

644
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:15,843
Come on, it looks like you're sleepy.

645
01:02:16,127 --> 01:02:18,561
Like this, wet your lip. Stay there!

646
01:02:23,567 --> 01:02:24,761
Go!

647
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:28,640
Ok, now love, let's do one standing!

648
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:35,404
And without the veil, so it's easier to see you.

649
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,525
Now, come here.

650
01:02:41,327 --> 01:02:45,240
Do you remember when, in Paris, we saw
the girl who moved like a tiger?

651
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:47,520
Aggressive.

652
01:02:48,087 --> 01:02:52,239
Mario, are you sure we need all of this
for my driving licence's picture?

653
01:02:52,447 --> 01:02:55,166
Love, don't worry, do the tiger!

654
01:02:58,767 --> 01:03:00,086
Ready?

655
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,006
There, good.
Come on!

656
01:03:04,007 --> 01:03:08,205
Now stay up straight,
with the sombrero.

657
01:03:10,727 --> 01:03:13,525
More provocative, sweetie.

658
01:03:14,327 --> 01:03:20,357
Go, go! Now do the hula dancing.
Like that!

659
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:27,486
Stop! Stay there!

660
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,086
Go!

661
01:03:33,967 --> 01:03:35,605
Indian!

662
01:03:38,767 --> 01:03:40,246
Right, good.

663
01:03:45,007 --> 01:03:46,645
Go, go!

664
01:03:47,487 --> 01:03:50,524
Stop! Go!

665
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,279
Your mouth!

666
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:57,442
And the leg!

667
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:03,359
Don't forget the lips, honey!

668
01:04:04,927 --> 01:04:06,838
Sensual!

669
01:04:07,807 --> 01:04:09,798
Almost vampiric.

670
01:04:14,967 --> 01:04:18,357
You know what I mean, come on.

671
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:23,686
Yes, good...
Go, go!

672
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:40,647
Excuse me, the prince Ali Bennali?

673
01:04:40,647 --> 01:04:44,362
-He's leaving.
-Leaving? -Yes, over there.

674
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:54,001
Your Highness.

675
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:56,641
I'm the accountant from your bank,
Mario Gasparri.

676
01:04:56,641 --> 01:05:00,595
I have something to show you, which
might interest you.

677
01:05:01,567 --> 01:05:03,285
My wife Pepita.

678
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,205
Pepita with sombrero.

679
01:05:05,407 --> 01:05:07,284
Pepita Hindu singing.

680
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:11,357
Pepita the she-tiger.
Pepita and the foam bath.

681
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:13,646
She's gorgeous.

682
01:05:13,847 --> 01:05:17,203
Pepita Oriental dream,
Pepita sunny morning...

683
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:20,359
Pepita Hawaian memory,
Pepita in intimacy...

684
01:05:20,807 --> 01:05:23,640
...and Pepita French revolution.

685
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:28,485
Cri!

686
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:38,439
Unfortunately, dear friend, I already have this type.

687
01:05:41,527 --> 01:05:45,679
Stockholm, 1963.
2 million crowns.

688
01:05:46,727 --> 01:05:48,718
260 million lira...

689
01:05:49,407 --> 01:05:51,079
But she's worth it, you know?

690
01:05:57,847 --> 01:06:01,442
I'm sorry. But I have many friends
over there.

691
01:06:01,687 --> 01:06:06,317
- I think some of them might be extremely
interested in this 'product'... -Thanks.

692
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:20,999
Salam.

693
01:06:29,927 --> 01:06:32,202
Until Africa...

694
01:06:33,887 --> 01:06:36,082
...I knew it was a crazy idea.

695
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:39,196
(Arabic) Let's go, Madams!

696
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:52,120
-Dear Mario?
-Yes?

697
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:55,475
This would be a great beach,
if there were a sea!

698
01:06:55,475 --> 01:06:58,366
Be careful not to burn your face!

699
01:07:03,527 --> 01:07:04,247
Mario!

700
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:08,962
Hey stop, let me down.

701
01:07:13,127 --> 01:07:16,005
Poor sweetheart, it's the heat.
I knew that.

702
01:07:16,367 --> 01:07:19,996
Don't exaggerate, honey.
This weather is actually quite temperate.

703
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:25,560
-Do you wanna go back?
-No, we have to continue, we're almost there!

704
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:28,527
You'll see how pretty it is,
such royal palaces.

705
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:29,921
Let's hope so.

706
01:07:30,487 --> 01:07:33,718
Where did I put my lighter...

707
01:07:35,407 --> 01:07:40,003
-How did that...?
-Well, I guess it's a little hot.

708
01:07:40,327 --> 01:07:45,196
Listen, I don't understand this cruise!
We saw only sand. So much for a 'fun' trip!

709
01:07:45,407 --> 01:07:49,195
I already told you, it's business for the bank!
Be a little understanding!

710
01:07:49,447 --> 01:07:51,915
-But in the desert...
-Yes, even in the desert!

711
01:07:51,915 --> 01:07:55,477
If only that idiot would bring us
some water. Excuse me, some water!

712
01:07:56,647 --> 01:07:58,717
Look at him sitting.

713
01:07:58,927 --> 01:08:01,282
Dear, be quiet, don't get mad.

714
01:08:04,487 --> 01:08:05,840
Excuse me!

715
01:08:06,047 --> 01:08:09,676
Excuse me, be nice please,
give me some water.

716
01:08:09,676 --> 01:08:14,796
Look at that! Sweet, affectionate,
o

717
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,806
I'll ask for more money.

718
01:08:58,407 --> 01:09:01,524
(Arabic) - Blond?
- Blond, blond. (more Arabic)

719
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,441
Not a blond.

720
01:09:32,441 --> 01:09:35,360
-Yes, she's blond.
-Not blond! (more Arabic)

721
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:39,121
Blond, blond!

722
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:49,404
He's right. He said she's a natural blonde,
but her hair was dyed!

723
01:09:49,404 --> 01:09:52,718
What does "arafje" mean?

724
01:10:36,007 --> 01:10:39,443
-Real blond?
-For real, Your Highness.

725
01:11:01,727 --> 01:11:05,925
2,000 dollars?
Heh, no Your Highness, I'm sorry...

726
01:11:06,927 --> 01:11:11,603
Please Madam, give me back the pictures.

727
01:11:14,567 --> 01:11:16,558
-There's a misunderstanding here:
I don't sell the picture, I sell the original!

728
01:11:16,767 --> 01:11:19,679
I don't sell the picture, I sell the original!

729
01:11:21,767 --> 01:11:24,406
My Lord is interested.
Where is she?

730
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,163
In the oasis. I'll go get her and I'll be right back!

731
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:30,206
Wait!

732
01:11:31,407 --> 01:11:34,080
Don't worry, my Lord will
send one of his Rolls-Royce.

733
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,238
-One of?
-He has 18 of them.

734
01:11:37,567 --> 01:11:39,762
-Wait here.
-Ok.

735
01:11:41,967 --> 01:11:44,276
- Blond, huh?!
-Absolutely blond, Your Highness!!

736
01:11:44,487 --> 01:11:47,001
I wouldn't have offered otherwise.

737
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:23,282
- So?
-Just a moment, Your Highness. She'll come.

738
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:47,004
This way? Oh, this is beautiful!

739
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,606
Here she is!

740
01:12:51,007 --> 01:12:53,601
-Do you have a swimming pool, too?
-Yes, over there.

741
01:12:56,927 --> 01:12:58,645
Good evening.

742
01:13:00,727 --> 01:13:04,163
Your Highness, look at how she walks, the hips!

743
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:07,678
A queen!
400 million lire is not enough for her!

744
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:10,802
A queen, Your Highness!

745
01:13:12,047 --> 01:13:13,799
-Mario, I was so scared!
-Why are you so late?

746
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:16,202
For a moment, I thought
they were going to kidnap me.

747
01:13:16,527 --> 01:13:20,486
Then I saw the Rolls Royce outside,
and I understood that everything was ok.

748
01:13:21,247 --> 01:13:23,841
-Who's this gentleman?
-The emir Omar Maragadir.

749
01:13:24,047 --> 01:13:26,607
-My wife, Your Highness.
-How are you?

750
01:13:26,927 --> 01:13:29,361
Due to our business, he wanted
to meet you.

751
01:13:30,727 --> 01:13:33,639
He furnished everything with
an Arabian taste, did you see?

752
01:13:33,887 --> 01:13:36,242
Why don't we make our living room like this, too?

753
01:13:36,487 --> 01:13:40,082
Of course in a big palace, the problem is
the servants. It's too expensive.

754
01:13:40,287 --> 01:13:41,242
But I like it.

755
01:13:41,447 --> 01:13:43,358
-Blond?
-True blond.

756
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:48,398
Dear, the ladies here have nothing on their heads,
why are you wearing this sort of helmet? Show you hair.

757
01:13:49,087 --> 01:13:52,238
Show Omar you nice blond hair!

758
01:13:58,887 --> 01:14:00,115
Do you like it?

759
01:14:00,447 --> 01:14:01,675
-Kill him!

760
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:05,323
What are you saying, "Arafje"?
What the hell did you do, Pepita?

761
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:10,240
I was so rushed, my hair was a mess,
I put a wig on.

762
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,921
-A wig?
-Yes, of course, a wig.

763
01:14:13,927 --> 01:14:16,202
Your Highness,
it's a wig!

764
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,520
Et-voila!

765
01:14:19,967 --> 01:14:23,084
-Do I look better like this?
-Oh yes, dear. Much better.

766
01:14:27,607 --> 01:14:29,677
Real, Your Highness.

767
01:15:09,847 --> 01:15:11,280
It's really good.

768
01:15:12,927 --> 01:15:15,725
There must be some black pepper in here, too.

769
01:15:26,447 --> 01:15:28,358
It's really good.

770
01:15:35,967 --> 01:15:38,117
What are you doing?
Playing "rock, paper, scissors"?

771
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:41,600
Hah, it's funny.

772
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:48,478
-Pepita, why don't you do the surf dance?
-Oh, no.

773
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:51,555
Show Omar how you do the surf dance.

774
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:55,642
-How can I? It's impossible, with this music.
-Come on, you're great with this music, too.

775
01:15:56,047 --> 01:15:57,799
Be nice with Omar.

776
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:02,200
Omar, look at how Pepita does the surf dance.

777
01:16:08,007 --> 01:16:09,486
She's amazing.

778
01:16:16,047 --> 01:16:17,844
Look at how she dances!

779
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:52,806
Heh no, for 300 million I would have stayed home.

780
01:16:56,047 --> 01:16:57,446
He's crazy.

781
01:17:41,007 --> 01:17:43,885
Ok, all good, we can sign it.

782
01:17:57,767 --> 01:18:02,557
That's good. Your money: 1, 2 and 3.

783
01:18:03,447 --> 01:18:08,077
As you can see, we kept our agreement.

784
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:19,762
-But... these are promissory notes!
-Of course, Sir. Today nobody pays in cash!

785
01:18:20,207 --> 01:18:23,005
There's the oil crisis, and the bad economic situation.

786
01:18:23,207 --> 01:18:26,643
-But I don't want promissory notes!
-What? You don't trust my name?

787
01:18:26,847 --> 01:18:29,600
-But I don't want promissory notes!
-But you signed!

788
01:18:29,927 --> 01:18:32,839
-I don't care if I signed!
-Kill him!

789
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:47,078
Pepito, quick!

790
01:18:48,247 --> 01:18:51,603
-Don't argue, just run!
-Don't you see we're dancing!

791
01:18:52,687 --> 01:18:53,881
Run!

792
01:18:57,127 --> 01:18:58,719
I was having so much fun.
What's wrong?

793
01:19:07,967 --> 01:19:09,525
Damn it!

794
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:20,642
Ouch! Help!

795
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:54,682
Guards, coem back! Let them go!

796
01:19:56,847 --> 01:19:58,360
We're safe!

797
01:19:59,087 --> 01:20:01,555
Mario, what happened?
Explain me!

798
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,642
You know what that
jerk asked me...

799
01:20:06,687 --> 01:20:09,121
-...he wanted to buy you!
-What?!

800
01:20:11,127 --> 01:20:15,757
Come, sweetheart. Let's go.

801
01:20:39,607 --> 01:20:42,485
-Is this oasis close?
-Yes, yes sir!

802
01:20:42,767 --> 01:20:44,997
-How close?
-Two days!

803
01:21:00,207 --> 01:21:01,925
Today it's less warm.

804
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:13,797
Why did we stop? What happened?

805
01:21:14,727 --> 01:21:15,796
Get out!

806
01:21:29,127 --> 01:21:30,480
Uff!

807
01:21:32,047 --> 01:21:33,639
Pepita!

808
01:21:35,007 --> 01:21:38,841
Did you see those men?
What's wrong?

809
01:21:39,047 --> 01:21:41,277
Nothing. I don't wanna continue.

810
01:21:41,807 --> 01:21:43,126
Why?

811
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:45,878
You don't love me anymore.

812
01:21:48,247 --> 01:21:53,275
-What are you talking about?
-You don't love me. You don't want me anymore.

813
01:21:54,527 --> 01:21:58,406
But love, it's 140 degrees,
we're in the desert...

814
01:21:59,007 --> 01:22:02,716
When a man loves a woman,
it's not a matter of temperature.

815
01:22:03,847 --> 01:22:05,883
You're such a kid...

816
01:22:12,607 --> 01:22:14,802
Don't you see, they're praying!

817
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:50,719
Come!

818
01:23:00,807 --> 01:23:02,001
Come.

819
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,044
Let's go, come on.

820
01:23:57,087 --> 01:24:00,762
Where the hell are you taking me?
I've seen only sand for the past 15 days!

821
01:24:00,967 --> 01:24:03,959
-Dear, I told you I have important business.
-Yea, with bedouins?

822
01:24:03,959 --> 01:24:07,199
No, they are very rich nomads.
They have oil. Not like that jerk...

823
01:24:07,407 --> 01:24:09,127
-Look, water!
-Oh good, go to the swimming pool and freshen up.

824
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:09,798
-Yes!

825
01:24:11,127 --> 01:24:12,799
Where is your master?

826
01:24:14,567 --> 01:24:17,240
Thanks. 
Wait for me here, love!

827
01:24:26,767 --> 01:24:28,678
My poor feet!

828
01:24:50,247 --> 01:24:52,397
-Your Highness.
-Salam.

829
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:07,835
(Arabic)
Let's see what he wants to sell.

830
01:25:15,967 --> 01:25:17,161
Thank you.

831
01:25:45,847 --> 01:25:48,202
Do you like this?

832
01:25:49,087 --> 01:25:51,521
A lot... no, thanks.

833
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:49,406
Thank you, you're all very kind but...
I have to go!

834
01:27:09,727 --> 01:27:13,322
Mohamed is not good for these things.
You made a mistake.

835
01:27:14,487 --> 01:27:17,638
-But his brother likes women.
-Oh, really?

836
01:27:18,527 --> 01:27:19,562
And where is he?

837
01:27:20,047 --> 01:27:23,198
-Well, the brother...
-Here.

838
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:30,601
So his brother... the black tent in front of us.

839
01:27:30,967 --> 01:27:32,525
-This one?
-Yes.

840
01:27:32,767 --> 01:27:33,995
Is he rich?

841
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:36,004
-How many Rolls Royce?
-Twelve.

842
01:27:36,004 --> 01:27:36,967
To není tak moc.

843
01:27:36,967 --> 01:27:37,604
Not so many.

844
01:27:44,447 --> 01:27:48,918
They like us dressed like this, with veils.

845
01:27:50,407 --> 01:27:52,602
We have so much fun..

846
01:27:52,887 --> 01:27:54,764
We have everything we want.

847
01:27:55,527 --> 01:27:59,440
I thank you for your offer,
but you come at a very sad moment.

848
01:27:59,767 --> 01:28:03,476
Ara the Finnish just died,
she was one of my favorite wives.

849
01:28:03,807 --> 01:28:06,367
-I'm sorry.
-I suffered a lot in these days.

850
01:28:06,647 --> 01:28:07,921
I can understand that.

851
01:28:11,807 --> 01:28:14,526
"Topless". Has it arrived in your country?

852
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:16,759
I suffered so much.

853
01:28:17,487 --> 01:28:21,639
But precisely for this reason, Your Highness...
"From a bad thing, a good one can come."

854
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:28,002
Maybe my Pepita can help you cure this pain,
and chase away these sad memories.

855
01:28:29,567 --> 01:28:30,636
You think so?

856
01:28:34,567 --> 01:28:39,880
Who knows. I could really love such
a beautiful creature.

857
01:28:40,967 --> 01:28:42,480
Kolik?

858
01:28:42,807 --> 01:28:46,766
I don't want to take advantage of your loss.
500 million lira.

859
01:28:47,607 --> 01:28:50,326
-That's a lot of money.
-But for a gorgeous creature.

860
01:28:54,807 --> 01:28:57,640
-But I don't have cash.
-Oh no, no permissory notes!

861
01:28:57,847 --> 01:29:01,442
-Only golden coins. -Oh, yes yes.
-And the rest, in jewels.

862
01:29:01,727 --> 01:29:03,683
Sure, I trust you, Your Highness.

863
01:29:03,967 --> 01:29:06,117
-Great, this way.
-We'll take the car? -Yes.

864
01:29:06,327 --> 01:29:07,965
No, I don't like this one. That one.

865
01:29:15,887 --> 01:29:17,559
What do you need the yacht for, Your Highness?

866
01:29:17,847 --> 01:29:22,284
Well I took it here now,
next year I'll take here the sea!

867
01:29:31,047 --> 01:29:32,480
Get out!

868
01:29:34,807 --> 01:29:36,240
We're here already.

869
01:30:03,927 --> 01:30:06,236
Would you like a couple of Cadillac?

870
01:30:06,447 --> 01:30:10,360
Cadillac? No, too big
for Europe.

871
01:30:17,727 --> 01:30:19,558
-Thank you.
-(Arabic)

872
01:30:27,007 --> 01:30:28,042
(Speaking Arabic)

873
01:30:43,167 --> 01:30:44,486
Excuse me.

874
01:31:00,047 --> 01:31:05,485
What's going on?
Let me go!

875
01:31:06,007 --> 01:31:08,157
I want the Consul!
Pepita!

876
01:31:09,447 --> 01:31:10,347
Let me go! Pepita!

877
01:31:28,727 --> 01:31:32,720
Do you mind taking the cost of a Rolls Royce
off the total price?

878
01:31:35,327 --> 01:31:40,560
So I'll head North slowly.
I haven't seen anything of this Africa.

879
01:31:41,727 --> 01:31:44,525
Before going back I would
like to have a real holiday.

880
01:31:44,525 --> 01:31:48,362
I'm sure there's plenty of great things to see.
I have seen only sand.

881
01:31:49,287 --> 01:31:51,755
Well, nice to meet you.

882
01:31:57,567 --> 01:31:59,285
For the trip.

883
01:32:00,887 --> 01:32:03,242
So, good-bye everybody, and thanks!

884
01:32:04,367 --> 01:32:06,881
-You car, madam.
-Yes, thanks.

885
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:13,125
Let's go.

886
01:32:25,167 --> 01:32:28,682
Pepita, forgive me! Stop!

887
01:32:29,607 --> 01:32:32,280
Love, that's enough.

888
01:32:34,567 --> 01:32:36,603
I don't want to stay here!

889
01:32:36,603 --> 01:32:38,564
Don't worry.

890
01:32:38,807 --> 01:32:41,446
I'll buy you back.

891
01:32:41,887 --> 01:32:45,516
No, that's not true!
You're not coming back for me!

892
01:32:46,247 --> 01:32:49,603
Wait, my love!

893
01:32:51,087 --> 01:32:53,840
Stop, my love!

894
01:32:57,607 --> 01:33:02,203
Stop! Take me with you!
I don't want to stay here!
