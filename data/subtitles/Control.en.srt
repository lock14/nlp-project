1
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,615
<i>Existence.</i>

2
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:46,078
<i>Well, what does it matter?</i>

3
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:50,914
<i>I exist on the best terms I can.</i>

4
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:55,712
<i>The past is now part of my future.</i>

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,048
<i>The present is well out of hand.</i>

6
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:33,746
Get it.

7
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,502
Ian. Pass us the ball, will you?

8
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,587
Knob cheese.

9
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:13,907
All right, Ian?

10
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:16,549
Ian.

11
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,050
Oh, you got it.

12
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,512
Today.

13
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,848
This is Deborah, you know,
who I told you about.

14
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:26,682
From the youth club.

15
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:34,606
You can't be in my gang
if you don't smoke.

16
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,942
Don't wanna be in your gang.

17
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:40,320
Neither do I.

18
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:07,304
I think we should go.

19
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:10,181
- Now?
- Yeah. I wanna go.

20
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,186
OK.

21
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:18,064
Ian, we're getting off.

22
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:30,492
- Who's the writer?
- Who'd you think?

23
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,098
Glucose...

24
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:56,973
...plus oxygen...

25
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:04,273
Carbon dioxide plus water.

26
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,567
You can clearly see here
that the chemicals

27
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,153
are currently out of balance.

28
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:14,781
Your task will be
to alter the molar ratios

29
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,617
in order to make the chemicals balance

30
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:22,081
before and after the combustion
reaction has occurred.

31
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:29,461
Wouldn't you say that was so,
Mr Curtis?

32
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:33,382
Ian?

33
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,300
Come on, stop messing.

34
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,386
Uh, Mr Curtis?

35
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,810
What?

36
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,483
Sorry, sir.

37
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:57,779
Who have we got today, then?

38
00:05:57,947 --> 00:05:59,697
Mrs Brady.

39
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:04,411
- We done her before?
- Don't think so.

40
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:07,831
Let's hope she's got
a sympathetic doctor.

41
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,461
I mean, I like
me neighbours, don't get me wrong.

42
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:17,048
Mind you, the stink of some of them.

43
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:20,134
I tell you, they don't wash
or don't know how to.

44
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:23,762
Stink, stink, stink.

45
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:26,389
Stink to high heaven of piss.

46
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:30,185
Mrs Brady, please can I use
your toilet, please?

47
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:32,019
'Course you can, love.

48
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:36,356
- Second on the left, down the hall.
- Thank you.

49
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:39,442
Where was I?

50
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,319
Oh, yes.

51
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:57,209
It says here Cirazapan usually
prescribed for schizophrenia.

52
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:02,380
Side effects include drowsiness,
apathy, agitation

53
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,007
and blurred vision.

54
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,802
I'm taking two.

55
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,233
Oh, here we go. Who's that?

56
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,528
Stop it now! Stop it.

57
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,115
- Hi.
- Hi, Nick.

58
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,909
Nick, yeah. Hi.

59
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:37,245
- Ian.
- Hi.

60
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:38,956
Hi.

61
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:42,500
Oh, wow, a dog. What's her name?

62
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:44,627
- Tess.
- Hello, Tess.

63
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:47,380
Come around to speak to, you know...

64
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:50,382
See if she wants to... for a bit.

65
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,970
- Debbie.
- Debbie, yeah. Yeah.

66
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:56,848
Debbie. Hi.

67
00:07:57,014 --> 00:08:00,475
- Hi.
- She's gorgeous. Debbie, hi.

68
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:03,937
Hi. Do you want to come in?

69
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,899
Hi.

70
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:10,901
Hi.

71
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,707
<i>My heart leaps up when I behold</i>

<i>So it be when I shall grow old</i>

76
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,389

<i>Bound each to each by natural piety</i>

80
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:09,748
- Did you write that?
- Wordsworth.

81
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:38,745
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

82
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:45,043
- I'm really excited for this.
- Yeah. Same here.

83
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,962
Never really into Bowie before,
you know, but...

84
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:55,010
It's a shame Nick couldn't come.

85
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,431
He did say I could go out with you.

86
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:02,268
He said it was all right.
As long as I looked after you.

87
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:04,602
Did he now?

88
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:10,942
Well, I didn't want him thinking we were
going behind his back or anything.

89
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:14,361
That's a bit presumptuous,
don't you think?

90
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:17,447
Why?

91
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:19,741
I might not have wanted
to go out with you.

92
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:22,619
- Go over there.
- All right.

<i>I'd put you on a movie reel</i>

<i>And that would be just fine</i>

00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:29,221
I think we should get married.

102
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:33,976
Are you asking?

103
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:37,980
You're mine.

104
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:40,774
Irretrievably.

105
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:45,111
- Am I now?
- Yeah.

106
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:48,490
And you know it.

107
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:42,038
Ian?

108
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:43,664
I've got a brew for you.

109
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,754
Ian?

110
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:03,558
All right, lads?

111
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:05,394
- All right.
- All right, mate.

112
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,687
It's a bit empty in here tonight.

113
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:10,981
- Tony Wilson's over there.
- Who?

114
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:13,900
Posh bloke from Granada TV.

115
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:17,238
- Oh, yeah.
- One day he'll be recognising me.

116
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:20,615
- You'll have to be out a bit more.
- Yeah.

117
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:22,743
Been a bit busy.

118
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:25,287
Getting married, finding a house.

119
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:26,871
Sounds like fun.

120
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:31,708
- How's the band?
- Yeah. Not bad.

121
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,211
It's not particularly good
either, is it?

122
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:39,383
No. We're pretty shite.

123
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,760
Be a lot less shite if we could find
a singer who could sing.

124
00:14:47,474 --> 00:14:50,393
I'm really looking forward
to seeing this lot tonight.

125
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,730
Apparently they tear up the stage
and kick off mid-set.

126
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:58,567
- All right?
- Gotta go.

127
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:01,361
- Take it easy.
- See you soon, Ian.

128
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,158
- Embarrassed of me or something?
- No.

129
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:12,205
- He's all right, him, isn't he?
- Yeah.

130
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,956
A bit tall, bit odd, but yeah.

131
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:52,075
So you're really
looking for a singer, then?

132
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,086
So, what do you like doing, Colin?

133
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:38,338
Watching telly.

134
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:43,760
- Apart from watching telly?
- Hmm, having breakfast, lunch and tea.

135
00:17:44,886 --> 00:17:46,971
Food? Well, that's a start.

136
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:49,473
There's plenty ofjobs
that involve food.

137
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:50,849
And watch telly.

138
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:54,436
- So you like food and watching telly?
- That's right.

139
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,771
Well...

140
00:17:56,939 --> 00:18:00,067
There's a job here working
at Knutsford Cinema

141
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,861
behind the hot dog counter.
How does that sound?

142
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:06,155
- I do not like hot dogs!
- OK.

143
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:08,866
Well, should we give 'em
a ring anyway?

144
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:18,667
The colour scheme is fuckin' brown

145
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,251
Everywhere in chicken town

146
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:23,881
The fuckin' pubs are fuckin' dull
The fuckin' clubs are fuckin' full

147
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,882
Of fuckin' girls and fuckin' guys
With fuckin' murder in their eyes

148
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:28,551
A fuckin' bloke gets fuckin' stabbed
Waitin' for a fuckin' cab

149
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:31,471
You fuckin' stay at fuckin' home
The fuckin' neighbours fuckin' moan

150
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:34,140
Keep the fuckin' racket down
This is fuckin' chicken town

151
00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:40,186
I'm a bit nervous, me.

152
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:43,856
Just with it being recorded
and all that.

153
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,903
I mean, we're actually
gonna be on a record.

154
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:51,239
I can play it at my gran's
and everything.

155
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:56,911
How about you, Hooky?
You nervous or what?

156
00:18:57,077 --> 00:18:58,746
Am I fuck, man?

157
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:04,876
- What about you, Ian?
- This is just the start.

158
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:09,338
Steven?

159
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,300
No.

160
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:20,015
The fuckin' pies are fuckin' old
The fuckin' chips are fuckin' cold

161
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:22,809
The fuckin' beer is fuckin' flat
The fuckin' flats have fuckin' rats

162
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:25,854
The fuckin' clocks are fuckin' wrong
The fuckin' days are fuckin' long

163
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,316
It fuckin' gets you fuckin' down
Evidently chicken town

164
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:30,942
Thank you. Good night.

165
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:38,740
Right, Warsaw, we're on.

166
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:42,452
Fuckin' hell! Who's opened the ham?
You lot nervous or what?

167
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:53,253
The next band of the night, folks:

168
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:57,633
Warsaw!

169
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:08,058
You all forgotten Rudolf Hess?

170
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:45,022
Ian, it's 400 pound.

171
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:50,319
Are you sure you want to do this?

172
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,404
I know, but...

173
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,824
The band are gonna pay us back.

174
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:00,371
OK.

175
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,377
Let's have a baby.

176
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:13,674
OK.

177
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:38,572
Four hundred quid.

178
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:44,452
What are you lot called again?

179
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:47,413
We were Warsaw.
Now we're Joy Division.

180
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,416
Excuse me, but what happened
to Slaves of Venus?

181
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,085
OK.

182
00:22:52,794 --> 00:22:55,671
- All right. Joy Division's good.
- Joy Division, eh?

183
00:22:55,837 --> 00:22:57,757
What's all that about?

184
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,010
It's the name of a brothel German
soldiers used during World War II.

185
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:06,847
Well, whatever. Studio's yours.

186
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,063
And it folds up to hold the record.

187
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:17,650
Have a look.

188
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,076
Yeah, it's good that, Bernard.

189
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,203
Thought-provoking.

190
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:35,290
That's right. Her name's Corrine Lewis.

191
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,503
Is 2.45 Thursday all right?

192
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:46,050
OK, then, Mr Mathers,
she'll see you then.

193
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,470
Bye.

194
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,056
Done. He sounds keen.

195
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,484
I'll get some water.

196
00:24:08,028 --> 00:24:12,450
<i>When you're looking at life
in a strange new room</i>

197
00:24:13,617 --> 00:24:15,327
<i>Maybe drowning soon</i>

198
00:24:16,453 --> 00:24:19,414
<i>Is this the start of it all?</i>

199
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:25,503
I'd never stand for that.

200
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:28,798
What?

201
00:24:28,964 --> 00:24:31,593
Being called something like
"the Buzzcocks".

202
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:34,721
What are you on about?

203
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:38,348
I don't know. I don't mind the Buzz,
but calling themselves Cocks.

204
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:40,518
I don't get it.

205
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:43,436
They're not calling themselves
the Cocks, are they?

206
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:45,896
They're calling themselves
the Buzzcocks.

207
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:49,942
Still got the word "cock" in it, though.

208
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:52,694
Just saying I wouldn't stand for it,
that's all.

209
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:53,904
Shh!

210
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:58,366
<i>They were the Buzzcocks.
If you didn't know, well, now you do.</i>

211
00:24:58,534 --> 00:25:01,412
<i>- As you'll soon know about these lot...
- That's us!</i>

212
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:04,498
<i>...a Manchester band called
Joy Division. This is an EP,</i>

213
00:25:04,664 --> 00:25:07,459
<i>An Ideal for Living.
And that wraps it up for tonight.</i>

214
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:11,462
<i>Keep the music coming in. Next week
we have The Clash, live in the studio.</i>

215
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:13,881
We've just been on telly, lads.

216
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:16,675
So is Tony Wilson a fan,
then, or what?

217
00:25:16,843 --> 00:25:18,301
That was bollocks.

218
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:21,805
He didn't even say if he liked it
or anything.

219
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:24,932
- 'Course he liked it.
- Well, how do you know?

220
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:29,813
He waved it
in front of camera like that.

221
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,106
Forget the record.
He's got to put us on.

222
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,115
Hiya.

223
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:43,741
There he is.

224
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,703
Um, just orange juice, please.

225
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:49,455
Go on, tell him.

226
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,588
OK, how are you?

227
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:01,424
You're gonna go out there,
it's all gonna be fine.

228
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:06,887
You're not up there having a wank, OK?

229
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:08,515
Think.

230
00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:17,772
You're a twat, you are.
You're a bastard.

231
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,066
Am I? Why is that?

232
00:26:19,232 --> 00:26:21,442
Because you haven't
put us on television.

233
00:26:23,653 --> 00:26:27,240
Well, then, you'll be the next band
I'll put on, darling.

234
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,452
Fuckin' right we're going on
before your band, twat!

235
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:33,788
Your band ain't even
a real fuckin' band.

236
00:26:33,954 --> 00:26:36,124
- Fuck off.
- Hooky'll do your head in.

237
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,166
Fuck off!

238
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:36,804
That was superb, that, lads.
It really was.

239
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,597
I've not seen a reaction like that

240
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:42,684
since George Best got kicked out
for blasting a bouncer.

241
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:44,978
I know how you can be better...
like that.

242
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:49,065
- Go on, then.
- Simple. You employ me.

243
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:50,900
You play, I manage.

244
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:54,820
We all get stinkin' rich and go buy
fuckin' great big houses in Cheshire.

245
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:56,780
- Job's a good 'un.
- And who are you?

246
00:27:56,948 --> 00:27:59,365
Rob Gretton. I already manage
a couple of bands.

247
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:02,327
But they couldn't sniff the sweat
round your bollocks.

248
00:28:02,493 --> 00:28:04,872
You lot are somethin' else.
I hold my hands up.

249
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:07,874
I am a believer in Joy Division.
Fuckin' hallelujah.

250
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,085
I'm also resident DJ here,

251
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,880
which means I know anyone of any
music biz use anywhere in this city.

252
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:17,508
I'll have you lot signed within
the month. In fact, I guarantee it.

253
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:20,135
We've already got a manager,
haven't we, lads?

254
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:22,054
- Who's that, then?
- Fuckin' me.

255
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:24,890
- What's your name, mate?
- Terry.

256
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:26,516
- Terry what?
- Terry Mason.

257
00:28:26,682 --> 00:28:29,853
Terry Mason. Tez.
You mind if I call you Tez?

258
00:28:30,603 --> 00:28:34,106
Tez, you know jack shit about this
business. Wanna know how I know?

259
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:36,067
'Cause I haven't heard of you.

260
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:39,319
I bet you haven't even got
a fuckin' telephone, have you?

261
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,323
Didn't think so. How will you book gigs

262
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:44,782
and cut deals without a phone,
you daft cunt?

263
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,701
No offence. I call everyone that.

264
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:50,829
Look, I've got to pack up my gig.
Ring me.

265
00:29:21,442 --> 00:29:24,027
Rob's Records, Rob speaking.

266
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:28,115
All right, Ian. Yeah, good, yeah.

267
00:29:33,702 --> 00:29:35,954
Well, that's fuckin' brilliant, Ian.

268
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,709
Well, I'll speak to you later, then.

269
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:42,544
Fine, I understand.

270
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:45,756
But you've got to sign with Factory.
This isn't an issue.

271
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:49,509
We're a fresh and exciting label,
you're a fresh and exciting band.

272
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:53,637
And, most importantly, we both fly
the flag for the Republic of Manchester.

273
00:29:53,805 --> 00:29:56,265
- Don't give a fuck about that.
- I'm a royalist.

274
00:29:56,432 --> 00:29:59,309
- And I suppose they're Nazis as well.
- We're not Nazis.

275
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:02,270
<i>- What about the money?
- It's 50l50 on the profits.</i>

276
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:05,898
You own all the publishing rights
and can walk away at any time.

277
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:08,859
- You serious?
- Rob...

278
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:12,154
I don't fuck about with talent
I want to work with.

279
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:16,284
I'll even sign the contracts in my
own blood if it'll make you happy.

280
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,035
We'll speak later, then.

281
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:24,500
Now remember, we are live,
so no swearing or they will cut you off.

282
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:26,585
- What about "arse"?
- What?

283
00:30:26,751 --> 00:30:30,046
- Is "arse" a swear word?
- "Arse", yes. It's a swear word.

284
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:32,006
- No, it's not.
- Bernard,

285
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:35,009
out there I know
"arse" isn't a swear word.

286
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:39,721
Here, in TV land,
"arse" is most definitely a swear word.

287
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:43,267
Trust me, I know
all about swearing and TV.

288
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:46,644
I'm a master of knowing
when I can and when I can't.

289
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,605
What about "big dog's cock"?
Can you say that?

290
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:54,818
No.

291
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:01,366
Seeing as how this is
the first television programme

292
00:31:01,532 --> 00:31:04,411
which brought you the
first appearances from everyone

293
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:07,455
from The Beatles to the Buzzcocks,
we like to think we bring you

294
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:10,500
the most new and interesting sounds
in the North-West.

295
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:13,126
They're called Joy Division,
a Manchester band

296
00:31:13,294 --> 00:31:17,464
except for the guitarist who comes from
Salford. A very important distinction.

297
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:19,174
<i>This is called Transmission.</i>

298
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,625
I can't believe you did it.

299
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:16,920
Must have lost about half a pint.

300
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,090
Shows he's serious, though.

301
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:22,175
- How you feelin', Tony?
- Mmm.

302
00:34:22,342 --> 00:34:24,427
I've felt better.

303
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:28,806
Hold on. You spelled Morriss wrong.
It's supposed to be double S.

304
00:34:28,974 --> 00:34:32,226
Tony, you're gonna have to add
another S to this, kid.

305
00:34:32,393 --> 00:34:33,478
Do I have to?

306
00:34:33,644 --> 00:34:37,188
It's not very professional to spell
the drummer's name wrong, is it?

307
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,204
Job's a good 'un. Thanks, Tony.

308
00:34:55,956 --> 00:34:57,583
So...

309
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,668
...I can officially announce
to the press

310
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:02,880
Joy Division have signed with Factory?

311
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:06,675
Can you fuck? I'll give you a ring
and arrange a proper meeting Monday.

312
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:13,389
Bit of a drama queen, isn't he?

313
00:35:31,822 --> 00:35:33,324
Ian...

314
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:37,369
...please come to bed.

315
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:50,255
Right, Geoff, well,
there's your reference.

316
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:51,882
Thank you.

317
00:35:57,012 --> 00:35:59,514
- That's fine.
- Well, good luck with it.

318
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:01,724
Thank you very much.

319
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:03,684
We are gonna be late, you know.

320
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:05,519
All right?

321
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:12,152
- What's up?
- Bloody dying with the flu.

322
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:14,320
He's all right,
just a bit of a sniffle.

323
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:17,489
He's fuckin' scared of playing
London for the first time.

324
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:19,157
Chocks away.

325
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:26,302
Well, that was shit.

326
00:37:26,469 --> 00:37:29,014
First gig in London,
there's nobody there.

327
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:31,932
And now I'm freezing.

328
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,103
I told you it's broke.

329
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:38,521
Well, you're probably just too thick
to work it properly.

330
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,233
It's a heater, Ian.
You turn it on and it heats up.

331
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,902
And that one doesn't, 'cause it's broke.

332
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:52,494
Give us a go on your sleeping bag.

333
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:56,496
- I'm dying here.
- Ten minutes. I'll give you it back.

334
00:37:56,664 --> 00:37:59,708
- No.
- Don't be so spoilt.

335
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:02,418
- I'm not. I'm dying!
- You've got a little cold

336
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:04,295
and that's it, babyface!

337
00:38:04,463 --> 00:38:06,547
- Hey!
- Fuck off!

338
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:10,342
- Pack it in, the pair of you.
- Ten minutes, I'll give it back!

339
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,137
I'm gonna crash the bloody car.

340
00:38:13,262 --> 00:38:16,389
- Ian, you fuckin' menk!
- Ian, calm it, mate!

341
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:19,518
Fuckin' hell.

342
00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:21,686
Pull over. Steve, pull over.

343
00:38:29,402 --> 00:38:31,612
Hooky, quick, quick, give us a hand.

344
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,532
Yeah, I've got his knees.

345
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:40,246
Fuckin' hell.

346
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:47,043
Ian, what's up with you, mate?

347
00:38:49,336 --> 00:38:52,132
Fuck, I thought he was just
trying to warm himself up.

348
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:54,884
This isn't right, this, Rob.

349
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:14,527
- What's the story, then?
- He's had some kind of fit.

350
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:18,405
Oh, right. They're clever,
these doctors, aren't they?

351
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:22,201
- What kind?
- Epilepsy. They're not sure.

352
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:26,329
I thought epilepsy
was only for head-the-balls.

353
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:30,416
- What?
- Head-the-balls. Spaccas.

354
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:32,668
Nice, Hooky, nice.

355
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:37,715
- So is he gonna be all right?
- He's not said a lot.

356
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,925
Well, if he were chatty we'd be worried.

357
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:48,474
We'll try you on...
carbamazepine...

358
00:39:49,768 --> 00:39:55,273
...phenytoin,
tiagabine and oxcarbazipine,

359
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,070
to be taken with the, uh, phenobarbital
that they gave you at the hospital.

360
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:03,947
In the meantime you'll be
on the waiting list to see

361
00:40:04,114 --> 00:40:06,867
a neurologist specialist
at Macclesfield General.

362
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:10,369
You should also be getting
plenty of early nights

363
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,914
and steering away from alcohol.

364
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:21,255
It's a matter of trial and error

365
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:24,675
until the right drug or
combination of drugs is found.

366
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,760
Some might work.

367
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:36,351
And... are there any side effects?

368
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:48,362
Carbamazepine's side effects
include skin rash,

369
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,824
double vision, drowsiness, dizziness,

370
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,827
gastric disturbances...
That means farting.

371
00:40:55,577 --> 00:41:00,166
Phenytoin's side effects
include drowsiness,

372
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:03,043
acne, overgrowth of the gums,

373
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,380
nausea, vomiting, mental confusion,

374
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:09,215
mental slowing. That's it.

375
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:21,184
Ian, you're
gonna be late for work.

376
00:41:29,693 --> 00:41:30,985
Ian?

377
00:41:35,114 --> 00:41:36,990
Ian.

378
00:41:40,202 --> 00:41:43,329
Uh, I'm sorry, Earnest.
I must have drifted off.

379
00:41:43,496 --> 00:41:46,625
- You all right?
- Mmm.

380
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,918
It's these tablets.

381
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:53,755
Yeah, well, them and
the late night concerts, eh?

382
00:41:54,882 --> 00:41:56,800
Listen, um...

383
00:41:56,967 --> 00:42:00,262
I'm not sure you can do
both jobs, Ian,

384
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:03,931
so just have a little think
about it, yeah?

385
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:08,436
As your supervisor I do need you
to have a think about it, all right?

386
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,355
Yeah.

387
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:37,713
Hello, is Corrine there, please?

388
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,382
It's Ian Curtis from
the Employment Exchange.

389
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,010
I was just wondering how she'd been...

390
00:42:46,262 --> 00:42:47,889
What?

391
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:50,141
Just like that?

392
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:54,853
From having a fit?

393
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:57,856
I didn't know that could...

394
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:02,860
Oh. I'm so, so sorry.

395
00:43:27,884 --> 00:43:30,719
Ian, love,
I'm going to bed now.

396
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:33,597
Are you comin'?

397
00:45:26,742 --> 00:45:28,202
All right?

398
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:33,041
Hi. They wouldn't let me in.
My name weren't on the guest list.

399
00:45:33,206 --> 00:45:34,250
I didn't know.

400
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:36,960
Somebody should've.
It's bloody embarrassing.

401
00:45:37,128 --> 00:45:39,588
No, I didn't know you were pregnant.

402
00:46:09,574 --> 00:46:11,159
- Hiya.
- All right, Debbie?

403
00:46:11,326 --> 00:46:13,827
- Where's Ian?
- Congratulations.

404
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:18,791
Oh, don't look so shocked, Rob.
It's been comin' a long time.

405
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:38,309
Hiya.

406
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:40,894
What are you doing here?

407
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:46,900
- She's a mate of Hooky's.
- Right.

408
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:50,277
Hi. I'm Ian's wife.

409
00:46:51,862 --> 00:46:53,322
Hi.

410
00:46:56,242 --> 00:46:59,369
Do you think it's right for you
to be out in your condition?

411
00:47:12,798 --> 00:47:14,050
Ian.

412
00:47:36,112 --> 00:47:37,697
Ian.

413
00:47:37,862 --> 00:47:40,240
Come on, into the pain.

414
00:47:40,407 --> 00:47:42,534
Keep going...
I've got the head, Debbie.

415
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:44,869
Well done, well done. One last time.

416
00:47:45,036 --> 00:47:46,413
- One last time.
- I can't.

417
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:48,456
Go on. Yes, you can,
you can, you can.

418
00:47:48,623 --> 00:47:52,126
Good girl. Well done.

419
00:47:54,961 --> 00:47:56,588
Good. That's great.

420
00:47:56,755 --> 00:47:59,132
Here we are. That's right.

421
00:48:01,217 --> 00:48:04,346
Ah, here we are. It's a girl.

422
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:07,724
Ohh!

423
00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:11,186
Congratulations.

424
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:12,603
Mum and Dad.

425
00:48:21,362 --> 00:48:23,905
Hello. Hello.

426
00:48:24,072 --> 00:48:25,782
Hey.

427
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:30,202
I need a cig.

428
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:42,603
Silklands Nightclub.

429
00:49:43,561 --> 00:49:45,313
Part-time barmaid.

430
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:47,648
One pound ten an hour.

431
00:49:47,815 --> 00:49:50,235
Mum and Dad can look after Natalie.

432
00:49:53,445 --> 00:49:55,322
What do you think?

433
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:00,411
Well, it won't be for long.

434
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:04,498
I'll take care of you as soon
as the new album comes out.

435
00:51:51,096 --> 00:51:53,639
Well, what happened
to that tenner I gave you?

436
00:52:02,313 --> 00:52:05,025
Well, my wages are the same
as everyone else's.

437
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,784
- Talk to Ian, you know. Find out.
- Mmm-hmm.

438
00:52:14,951 --> 00:52:16,409
OK.

439
00:52:17,952 --> 00:52:20,956
- No promises.
- All right, I'll ask him.

440
00:52:22,123 --> 00:52:23,583
Look, I've gotta go.

441
00:52:25,085 --> 00:52:27,336
Give Natalie a kiss for me.

442
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:31,840
I love you too.

443
00:52:40,974 --> 00:52:42,184
Not bad, eh?

444
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:46,646
The journalist makes us out to be
a bunch of pricks. Who gives a fuck?

445
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:49,065
A bunch of cool pricks,
that's what I say.

446
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,360
- Who's that?
- Some French bird.

447
00:52:52,527 --> 00:52:53,902
Wants to do an interview.

448
00:52:54,778 --> 00:52:57,657
She's not a Frenchy.
She's, uh, she's a Belgy.

449
00:52:57,822 --> 00:53:00,201
- What did you tell her?
- I said I'd ask,

450
00:53:00,367 --> 00:53:02,619
but it's unlikely to happen now.

451
00:53:02,786 --> 00:53:05,998
It's only a crappy European fanzine.

452
00:53:06,164 --> 00:53:09,208
Well, I'm all right.
Why don't we do it tonight?

453
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:13,211
We can invite her back
to where we're staying.

454
00:53:14,672 --> 00:53:16,882
- What's her name?
- Annik.

455
00:53:17,048 --> 00:53:21,010
Annik. Different.

456
00:53:21,177 --> 00:53:22,762
It's foreign.

457
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:27,349
I'll have a word, boss.

458
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:30,311
<i>Annik? Hola.</i>

459
00:53:40,862 --> 00:53:42,947
Come on, then. Let's have it.

460
00:53:49,286 --> 00:53:51,873
OK.

461
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:55,460
OK, so, um...
Do you like the Buzzcocks?

462
00:53:58,211 --> 00:53:59,880
They're a good laugh.

463
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:03,509
Yeah, they're all right,
apart from the "cocks" bit.

464
00:54:07,429 --> 00:54:09,472
There you go.

465
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:12,934
What is the most beautiful thing
you've seen in your life?

466
00:54:14,811 --> 00:54:18,356
I saw a beautiful drum kit down at
Johnny Roadhouse's shop once.

467
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,027
What about music?
Is that beautiful?

468
00:54:24,193 --> 00:54:26,278
Some of it.

469
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:30,157
What about Joy Division's music?

470
00:54:30,324 --> 00:54:32,702
Some of it, yeah, but...

471
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:35,454
...some of it's
not meant to be beautiful.

472
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:44,295
Does anyone believe in love?

473
00:54:44,463 --> 00:54:49,842
I believe in pure... sex.

474
00:54:52,262 --> 00:54:54,304
I believe in feeling, yeah.

475
00:54:55,847 --> 00:54:57,391
What does that mean?

476
00:54:59,476 --> 00:55:01,561
You know, like if I had a car,

477
00:55:01,728 --> 00:55:04,481
and I felt love for the car
and somebody kicked my car.

478
00:55:04,648 --> 00:55:08,025
I'd be as upset as if
they kicked my girlfriend.

479
00:55:15,615 --> 00:55:17,909
So you're not a journalist, then?

480
00:55:18,077 --> 00:55:20,663
It's a hobby thing, not a full-time job.

481
00:55:22,414 --> 00:55:26,126
I work for the Belgian embassy,
for the chancellor.

482
00:55:26,835 --> 00:55:28,920
Sounds interesting.

483
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:32,297
Free, independent woman.

484
00:55:33,507 --> 00:55:35,592
I suppose so, yes.

485
00:55:43,434 --> 00:55:45,686
Tell me about Macclesfield.

486
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:51,608
It's grey, it's miserable.

487
00:55:53,943 --> 00:55:56,112
I've wanted to escape it my whole life.

488
00:56:03,077 --> 00:56:04,827
What about your wife?

489
00:56:07,246 --> 00:56:09,206
She loves it in Macclesfield.

490
00:56:16,713 --> 00:56:18,965
You were married so young.

491
00:56:19,757 --> 00:56:22,552
I've never heard of people
marrying so young.

492
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:25,012
Yeah, I know.

493
00:56:31,143 --> 00:56:33,563
My marriage was a mistake.

494
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:49,202
- Are you tired?
- Mmm-hmm.

495
00:59:06,302 --> 00:59:08,929
Ian?

496
00:59:15,894 --> 00:59:16,896
Ian?

497
00:59:43,253 --> 00:59:45,088
What time are they coming for you?

498
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,757
Half an hour.

499
00:59:48,215 --> 00:59:50,259
Right. I'm gonna nip to the shop.

500
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:52,094
Back in a minute, OK?

501
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,257
You got your passport, Ian?

502
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:39,847
Up the continental in the rental.
Come on.

503
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,257
Fresh air.

504
01:01:20,217 --> 01:01:21,760
All right, love?

505
01:01:23,594 --> 01:01:24,596
- Hi.
- Hi.

506
01:01:24,804 --> 01:01:26,056
Hiya.

507
01:01:30,226 --> 01:01:31,811
I'll get in the back this time.

508
01:02:06,259 --> 01:02:07,885
Hi, Debbie.

509
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:35,077
I must have been out
when you called.

510
01:02:35,702 --> 01:02:38,371
It was hard to get to a phone.

511
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:47,338
Come on, girl. Yeah.

512
01:02:47,547 --> 01:02:50,465
Come on, girl.

513
01:02:59,016 --> 01:03:01,393
Did you remember to take your pills?

514
01:03:01,601 --> 01:03:02,978
Yeah.

515
01:03:06,313 --> 01:03:08,608
Are they working?

516
01:03:10,735 --> 01:03:12,612
I had an attack in Berlin.

517
01:03:12,945 --> 01:03:15,405
Oh, Ian, if they're not working

518
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:19,326
we need to get you a doctor's
appointment to change the medication.

519
01:03:25,248 --> 01:03:27,375
We really missed you.

520
01:03:34,547 --> 01:03:37,009
Oh, there's this girl at work
called Claire,

521
01:03:37,217 --> 01:03:40,304
and, uh, she's invited us
to her flat warming party.

522
01:03:40,512 --> 01:03:42,222
Hasn't she?

523
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:46,059
And I said, um, that we'd go. 'Cause
Mum and Dad can look after Natalie.

524
01:03:46,226 --> 01:03:48,353
That way we get a lie in. Don't we?

525
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,943
Daddy. Daddy's home.

526
01:03:56,110 --> 01:03:57,987
- Do you like the Buzzcocks?
- Yeah.

527
01:03:58,152 --> 01:03:59,987
We're on tour with them as well.

528
01:04:00,155 --> 01:04:03,574
Don't know what you were
worried about. He fits in fine.

529
01:04:03,742 --> 01:04:07,996
But he can seem a bit distant
to people he don't know. Trust me.

530
01:04:10,331 --> 01:04:12,375
Do you trust him when he's away?

531
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:16,920
- You know, with other girls.
- Totally.

532
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:23,342
He's so protective, you know.
He hates me wearing short skirts.

533
01:04:24,344 --> 01:04:26,304
Goes mad if I talk to other blokes.

534
01:04:28,514 --> 01:04:30,974
He is quite famous now,
though, isn't he?

535
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:33,311
Not to me.

536
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:36,271
I still wash his underpants.

537
01:04:42,402 --> 01:04:44,445
Do you want to sleep with other men?

538
01:04:44,653 --> 01:04:46,030
What?

539
01:04:46,197 --> 01:04:48,407
Do you want to sleep with other men?

540
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:53,204
That's a strange question.

541
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:57,833
Because... if you did...

542
01:04:59,251 --> 01:05:00,710
...it'd be OK.

543
01:05:02,628 --> 01:05:04,088
I'd be OK.

544
01:05:06,132 --> 01:05:08,009
Are you being serious?

545
01:05:11,846 --> 01:05:15,766
When you say a thing like that it makes
me think you don't love me anymore.

546
01:05:18,726 --> 01:05:20,603
I don't think I do.

Kill it, kill it.

554
01:07:56,163 --> 01:07:58,289
- Something's up.
- What?

555
01:07:58,498 --> 01:08:00,876
Rob's got one of his cheesy grins
going again.

556
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:03,420
You've been spending our wages,
Rob, or what?

557
01:08:03,628 --> 01:08:06,297
Come on, then,
you twisted bastard, out with it.

558
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:11,010
It's all happenin', boys.
Pack your bags, saddle up.

559
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:15,056
Nineteenth of May we're off to the
US of fuckin' A for a two-week tour.

560

- You're joking?
- We're gonna be contenders.

561
01:08:20,644 --> 01:08:22,395
We're gonna be somebodies.

562
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:24,855
How'd you wangle that one?

563
01:08:25,023 --> 01:08:28,067
I put a lackey band
around Tony's cock and balls.

564
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:29,484
Did it drop off?

565
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,988
I thought we'd celebrate.
Bring them here, Terry.

566
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:34,532
Nice one.

Eh?

570
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,993
How long have you been seeing her?

571
01:09:29,289 --> 01:09:32,627
Answer me, Ian! Don't ignore me!

572
01:09:38,923 --> 01:09:40,466

Please answer me!

Sorry, Debbie.

587
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:20,697
I'll finish with her.

Good night. God bless.

That was superb, that, Ian, mate.

611
01:18:26,115 --> 01:18:27,951
You played a fuckin' blinder.

612
01:18:28,117 --> 01:18:29,827
Who won the fight, Ian or Ian?

613
01:18:29,993 --> 01:18:31,787
It's like Ian knocked Ian out to me.

614
01:18:31,953 --> 01:18:34,332
Twatted himself
with a right good uppercut.

615
01:18:38,418 --> 01:18:41,671
- Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant.
- Girls, girls, not now.

621
01:19:13,242 --> 01:19:15,368
Chin up. Could be worse.

622
01:19:15,578 --> 01:19:17,621
Could be the lead singer in The Fall.

623
01:19:36,262 --> 01:19:37,597
Ian.

624
01:19:37,765 --> 01:19:40,600
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

625
01:19:45,145 --> 01:19:48,149

Ian, you are so depressing.

01:21:17,146 --> 01:21:19,440
I'm so happy to sit with you here.

632
01:21:23,653 --> 01:21:24,904
Me too.

633

I don't know what to say.

634
01:21:43,462 --> 01:21:45,840
I never felt this way before.

635
01:21:51,011 --> 01:21:52,971
But...

636
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,850
...at the same time I feel like

637
01:21:56,015 --> 01:21:59,103
I don't really know
anything about you, and...

638
01:22:01,188 --> 01:22:03,398
...you don't know me, and...

639
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:11,488
Well, what do you want to know?

640
01:22:19,704 --> 01:22:21,832
Tell me your favourite movie.

641
01:22:22,832 --> 01:22:24,083
Hmm...

- Anything else?
- Your favourite colour.

645
01:22:44,519 --> 01:22:46,645
Mine is purple.

646
01:22:47,939 --> 01:22:51,192
Blue. Man City blue.

647
01:22:52,984 --> 01:22:54,779
What is Man City blue?

648
01:22:56,279 --> 01:22:58,823
Well, Man City is a football club.

649
01:23:00,283 --> 01:23:01,743
And they wear blue.

650
01:23:16,631 --> 01:23:19,176
- Ian...
- Hmm?

651
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,725
I'm a little scared.

652
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:30,103
Scared of what?

653
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:35,858
Scared of falling in love with you.

654
01:24:33,661 --> 01:24:35,371
Hiya.

655
01:24:37,247 --> 01:24:39,123
I'm so glad you're home.

656
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:42,252
I'll make you a cup of tea.

657
01:25:51,774 --> 01:25:53,900
I don't want to hurt you, Debbie.

658
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,657
Ian?

659
01:26:03,702 --> 01:26:05,119
Come to bed, eh?

660
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:12,877
- Taken my pills.
- Ian?

661
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,811

Mr Curtis, I am here to tell you
that you are well enough to leave,

664
01:27:28,654 --> 01:27:31,198
but you must get some rest
for several days.

665
01:27:31,364 --> 01:27:34,952
Just be aware that your condition
is extremely weak at the moment.

666
01:27:35,869 --> 01:27:38,162
But I am discharging you.

667
01:27:38,329 --> 01:27:39,789
Thank you.

668
01:27:46,671 --> 01:27:48,131
Well, that's that, then.

01:28:12,904 --> 01:28:14,697
<i>And how it affects me.</i>

676
01:28:15,655 --> 01:28:17,699
Panic's over. He's here.

677
01:28:19,158 --> 01:28:20,618
<i>Now they want more.</i>

678
01:28:20,786 --> 01:28:23,872
<i>- They expect me to give more.
- Just enjoy yourself.</i>

679
01:28:26,166 --> 01:28:28,001
<i>And I don't know if I can.</i>

680
01:28:30,877 --> 01:28:33,546
<i>It's like it's not happening to me,</i>

681
01:28:33,713 --> 01:28:37,551

You're on.

688
01:29:28,555 --> 01:29:31,809

- What?

689
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:45,572
Go and get Alan from Crispy Ambulance,

How long do you need?

692
01:30:04,713 --> 01:30:06,841
You know the words to our songs,
don't you?

693
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:08,551
- Most of them. What?
- Get on.

- Serious?
- I look like I'm fucking jokin'?

696
01:30:32,907 --> 01:30:34,074
Off! Off! Off!

697
01:30:34,283 --> 01:30:36,159
Shit!

698
01:30:36,327 --> 01:30:38,287
You all right, Ian, mate?

699
01:30:43,707 --> 01:30:45,167
Ready to go on?

700
01:30:45,793 --> 01:30:48,503
Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian!

701
01:30:48,671 --> 01:30:50,965
Ian, talk to me.

702
01:30:53,301 --> 01:30:55,176
- OK.
- OK.

703
01:31:15,445 --> 01:31:18,364
- Where's my 20 quid?
- In my "fuck off" pocket.

704
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:53,814
Twenty quid. Go on.

705
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,231
I want 50.

706
01:31:56,358 --> 01:31:57,818
You fucker.

707
01:32:08,869 --> 01:32:10,912
Get Hooky off the stage now!

708
01:32:19,462 --> 01:32:21,506
Get off! Fuckin' get off!

709
01:32:22,966 --> 01:32:24,050
You, you fucker!

710
01:32:24,259 --> 01:32:26,136
Get the fuck out!

711
01:32:36,395 --> 01:32:38,188
I don't get it, Ian.

712
01:32:38,354 --> 01:32:41,233
I don't get why you're
doing this to yourself.

713
01:32:42,234 --> 01:32:45,110
- It's all coming apart.
- No, it's all coming together.

714
01:32:45,278 --> 01:32:48,198
Tonight was great.
It'll go down in history.

715
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:53,159
You remember Lou Reed
at the Free Trade Hall?

716
01:32:53,786 --> 01:32:56,079
- The riot?
- That's right, the fuckin' riot.

717
01:32:56,247 --> 01:32:57,872
Best gig I've ever been to.

718
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:04,378
It all used to be so simple,
everything.

719
01:33:05,796 --> 01:33:08,925
Now everyone hates me.
I've made everyone hate me.

720
01:33:09,091 --> 01:33:10,551
No one hates you.

721
01:33:10,717 --> 01:33:13,261
- Even the people who love me hate me.
- Debbie?

722
01:33:13,429 --> 01:33:15,722
- And Natalie.
- How can Natalie hate you?

723
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:19,643
- For Christ's sake.
- She will, though. I know she will.

724
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,020
You're a good dad, Ian.

725
01:33:22,186 --> 01:33:25,523
No, Tony, I'm not. I know I'm not.

726
01:33:25,731 --> 01:33:29,944
If I was a good dad,
then I wouldn't be doing all... this.

727
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:36,533
And what about Annik?
She loves you. You love her.

728
01:33:39,578 --> 01:33:41,954
- I hate her.
- And you love her.

729
01:33:46,876 --> 01:33:49,002
You can't pin all that on us.

730
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,380
We didn't start the fuckin' riot.

731
01:33:54,257 --> 01:33:56,719
Mate, you're pissing up
the wrong tree here.

732
01:33:56,926 --> 01:33:59,680
You think I owe you money
for the damages? Guess what?

733
01:33:59,846 --> 01:34:02,515
I don't. So shut the fuck up
and start suing,

734
01:34:02,681 --> 01:34:06,185
'cause that's the only way you're
gonna get a fuckin' bean out of me.

735
01:34:07,228 --> 01:34:08,854
Wanker.

736
01:34:09,479 --> 01:34:12,567
Who the fuck...?

737
01:34:16,612 --> 01:34:19,155
<i>- Hello.
- It's Ian.</i>

738
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:32,083
Oh, fuckin' shine a light!
Aren't you in enough trouble?

739
01:34:35,462 --> 01:34:37,840
- We need somewhere to stay.
- Try a hotel.

740
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:41,301
I'm skint, and you still
owe me some money.

741
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:45,055
Fuckin' hell! Have I got Barclays
tattooed on my forehead?

742
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:47,556
Get in.

743
01:34:56,189 --> 01:34:58,149
Tea's in the pot, bedroom's in there.

744
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:00,109
Spare noddys in the drawer.

745
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:01,528
Is this a bad time?

746
01:35:01,694 --> 01:35:04,363
No! I'm just in the mood
for a desperate social call

747
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:07,408
from you and Joan of Arc.

748
01:35:08,993 --> 01:35:10,453
Yes?

749
01:35:11,746 --> 01:35:13,706
Debbie! Great!

750
01:35:13,913 --> 01:35:17,835
And what the fuck can I do for you?
Need some money, a place to crash?

751
01:35:18,042 --> 01:35:20,170
Fuckin' lightbulb need changin'?

752
01:35:22,381 --> 01:35:24,173
And you don't know where he is.

753
01:35:24,882 --> 01:35:26,301
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>

754
01:35:29,136 --> 01:35:31,180
Something about Derby?

755
01:35:32,014 --> 01:35:35,141
Well, it's nice to know you two
are talking properly again.

756
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:39,604
Listen, Debbie,
I don't know where the fuck he is.

757
01:35:39,813 --> 01:35:41,939
As usual, I know fuck all.

758
01:35:43,233 --> 01:35:44,400
Don't I?

759
01:35:46,778 --> 01:35:48,488
Don't I?

760
01:35:48,695 --> 01:35:52,283
Rob, who are you talking to?

761
01:36:00,666 --> 01:36:02,000
Ian.

762
01:36:03,542 --> 01:36:05,252
What, he's there with you?

763
01:36:09,548 --> 01:36:11,341
Is she with him?

764
01:36:13,636 --> 01:36:19,515
Yeah. We're all here.
One big fuckin' happy family.

765
01:36:27,106 --> 01:36:28,983
She wants a divorce.

766
01:36:37,949 --> 01:36:39,534
You can sleep here.

767
01:36:44,122 --> 01:36:46,166
Stay as long as you like, Ian.

768
01:36:53,338 --> 01:36:55,798
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

769
01:37:20,113 --> 01:37:23,867
Ian? I've got an idea.

770
01:37:26,368 --> 01:37:29,454
I've been studying hypnosis.

771
01:37:58,481 --> 01:37:59,733
<i>Ian?</i>

772
01:38:00,943 --> 01:38:02,985
<i>Let me in, love.</i>

773
01:38:04,613 --> 01:38:06,488
<i>Just want to talk.</i>

774
01:38:06,698 --> 01:38:11,077
<i>You're mine. Irretrievably.</i>

775
01:38:12,328 --> 01:38:14,287
<i>I'm a little scared.</i>

776
01:38:15,788 --> 01:38:18,082
<i>Scared of falling in love with you.</i>

777
01:38:18,667 --> 01:38:20,543
<i>This has to be for good.</i>

778
01:38:21,586 --> 01:38:23,630
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

779
01:38:25,006 --> 01:38:28,592
<i>I owe you everything.
I love you.</i>

780
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,802
<i>What does that mean?</i>

781
01:38:32,637 --> 01:38:34,931
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

782
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:36,891
<i>So it was my life began...</i>

783
01:38:37,059 --> 01:38:40,395
<i>- I don't deserve this.
- So is it now I am a man</i>

784
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:41,979
<i>I didn't do enough.</i>

785
01:38:42,146 --> 01:38:44,774
<i>So it be you and I shall grow old</i>

786
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:46,525
<i>I should have tried harder.</i>

787
01:38:46,693 --> 01:38:47,860
<i>Or let me die</i>

788
01:38:50,529 --> 01:38:53,239
<i>And I could wish my days to be</i>

789
01:38:54,033 --> 01:38:56,076
<i>Bound each to each</i>

790
01:38:56,284 --> 01:38:58,328
<i>By natural...</i>

791
01:39:09,046 --> 01:39:10,756
Hi.

792
01:39:10,922 --> 01:39:12,425
Hi.

793
01:39:14,092 --> 01:39:15,469
I miss you.

794
01:39:17,554 --> 01:39:20,806
<i>- Is everything all right?
- I don't know, Annik.</i>

795
01:39:21,015 --> 01:39:22,350
I don't know.

796
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:25,854
<i>It all feels wrong.</i>

797
01:39:30,149 --> 01:39:33,027
Ian, you are confusing me.

798
01:39:35,654 --> 01:39:39,408
I know. I know I am.

799
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:48,123
<i>Dear Annik,</i>

800
01:39:49,542 --> 01:39:52,877
<i>I know I'm intruding on your life,
not you on mine.</i>

801
01:39:53,712 --> 01:39:56,881
<i>I felt as if things were becoming
a bit clearer earlier on,</i>

802
01:39:57,091 --> 01:40:00,844
<i>but can now see everything
falling to pieces before my eyes.</i>

803
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:06,056
<i>I'm paying dearly for past mistakes.</i>

804
01:40:06,224 --> 01:40:09,018
<i>I never realised how
one mistake in my life</i>

805
01:40:09,185 --> 01:40:12,939
<i>some four or five years ago
would make me feel how I do.</i>

806
01:40:16,233 --> 01:40:19,569
<i>I struggle between what I know
is right in my own mind,</i>

807
01:40:19,778 --> 01:40:23,948
<i>and some warped truthfulness
as seen through other people's eyes</i>

808
01:40:24,114 --> 01:40:27,368
<i>who have no heart, and
can't see the difference anyway.</i>

809
01:40:27,534 --> 01:40:29,162
Eh-up, you.

810
01:40:31,747 --> 01:40:32,914
Come on in.

811
01:40:33,123 --> 01:40:35,167
<i>I saw Apocalypse Now at the cinema.</i>

812
01:40:35,376 --> 01:40:37,670
<i>I couldn't take me eyes
away from the screen.</i>

813
01:40:37,836 --> 01:40:39,587
What you been up to, then, eh?

814
01:40:39,755 --> 01:40:43,257
<i>On the record, there's Marlon Brando
reading The Hollow Men,</i>

815
01:40:43,466 --> 01:40:48,595
<i>the struggle between man's conscience
and his heart until things go too far,</i>

816
01:40:48,805 --> 01:40:51,640
<i>get out of hand,
and can never be repaired.</i>

817
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:57,604
<i>Is everything so worthless in the end?</i>

818
01:40:57,813 --> 01:40:59,773
<i>Is there any more?</i>

819
01:40:59,939 --> 01:41:02,859
<i>What lies beyond?
What is left to carry on?</i>

820
01:41:03,025 --> 01:41:08,155
Ian, your room's still here.
You know that, don't you?

821
01:41:08,363 --> 01:41:09,907
I know, Mum.

822
01:41:12,326 --> 01:41:13,493
Thanks.

823
01:41:20,667 --> 01:41:24,003
<i>I have the feeling
the epileptic condition will worsen.</i>

824
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:26,131
<i>It frightens me.</i>

825
01:41:28,507 --> 01:41:31,719
<i>It's a lie to say
"I'm not afraid any more".</i>

826
01:41:32,511 --> 01:41:35,430
<i>There's nothing the doctors can do
but try tablets.</i>

827
01:41:36,931 --> 01:41:38,559
<i>I felt I had to tell you this</i>

828
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:41,520
<i>even though it might change
your feelings for me.</i>

829
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,733
<i>I've been thinking of you constantly,
trying to rationalise our situation,</i>

830
01:41:46,899 --> 01:41:49,109
<i>thinking of the things we've done.</i>

831
01:41:49,277 --> 01:41:51,820
<i>Images and thoughts prey on my mind,</i>

832
01:41:52,029 --> 01:41:54,739
<i>before my eyes all times
of the day and night.</i>

833
01:41:55,865 --> 01:41:58,702
<i>And while some things are beyond
my understanding,</i>

834
01:41:58,868 --> 01:42:01,872
<i>I know that I love you
and will do forever.</i>

835
01:42:03,582 --> 01:42:07,252
<i>Until I see you again,
I miss you with all my heart.</i>

836
01:42:08,211 --> 01:42:11,338
<i>All my love... Ian.</i>

837
01:42:41,574 --> 01:42:44,034
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.</i>

838
01:42:44,243 --> 01:42:47,663
<i>- You all right?
- I'm not coming out tonight.</i>

839
01:42:47,831 --> 01:42:49,207
<i>Why not?</i>

840
01:42:50,248 --> 01:42:52,627
I'm gonna go home. Speak to Debbie.

841
01:42:52,835 --> 01:42:54,795
<i>Does she want to speak to you?</i>

842
01:42:55,462 --> 01:42:59,216
Dunno. I just feel
the need to speak to her.

843
01:42:59,382 --> 01:43:01,134
<i>Well, if you're sure.</i>

844
01:43:01,301 --> 01:43:03,761
I'll see you Monday morning
at the airport.

845
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:06,597
<i>- You all ready and packed?
- Not yet.</i>

846
01:43:06,765 --> 01:43:09,600
<i>I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
I'm like a fuckin'kid.</i>

847
01:43:09,766 --> 01:43:11,644
Yeah. Same here.

848
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:14,939
<i>I've got all my clothes laid out
on my bed and everything.</i>

849
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:20,319
<i>- I'll see you Monday.
- Don't be late.</i>

850
01:43:20,484 --> 01:43:23,029
Don't worry. I'll be there.

851
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:39,168
I'm off.

852
01:43:39,795 --> 01:43:42,171
I'm gonna go meet up
with Debbie tonight.

853
01:44:08,988 --> 01:44:12,408
<i>Could we have your attention
please, ladies and gentlemen?</i>

854
01:44:12,574 --> 01:44:15,828
<i>We are ready to begin now
the sale on behalf of our bank</i>

855
01:44:15,994 --> 01:44:19,038
<i>to disperse the repossessed property</i>

856
01:44:19,206 --> 01:44:21,416
<i>formerly owned by a Mr Stroszek.</i>

857
01:44:21,625 --> 01:44:24,168
<i>Colonel Ralph Wade
will be our auctioneer.</i>

858
01:44:24,336 --> 01:44:28,171
<i>I'll be serving as your clerk.
We're ready to begin with the auction.</i>

859
01:44:50,109 --> 01:44:53,194
<i>Whoa!</i>

860
01:46:05,761 --> 01:46:07,971
What are you doing here?

861
01:46:09,556 --> 01:46:11,684
Don't divorce me, Debbie.

862
01:46:13,810 --> 01:46:15,395
I don't want to lose you.

863
01:46:17,814 --> 01:46:20,108
It's not that simple, though,
is it, Ian?

864
01:46:22,069 --> 01:46:24,112
Is this really what you want?

865
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:28,157
No. No, I don't.

866
01:46:31,034 --> 01:46:33,078
But you love someone else.

867
01:46:37,875 --> 01:46:40,167
What's that got to do with us?

868
01:46:41,545 --> 01:46:42,921
Everything.

869
01:46:49,092 --> 01:46:51,136
You can't leave her, can you?

870
01:46:53,889 --> 01:46:55,599
It's not that easy.

871
01:46:56,557 --> 01:46:59,560
I've tried. She won't go away.

872
01:47:04,899 --> 01:47:07,109
Well, then you've made your decision.

873
01:47:11,613 --> 01:47:12,864
Go on then.

874
01:47:13,032 --> 01:47:16,118
- What?
- Go on, leave me alone!

875
01:47:16,327 --> 01:47:17,328
Ian.

876
01:47:17,536 --> 01:47:20,497
Don't come back until the morning.
I'll be gone by then.

877
01:47:21,497 --> 01:47:22,957
Get out!

878
01:49:14,726 --> 01:49:16,770
<i>So this is permanence</i>

879
01:49:18,104 --> 01:49:20,314
<i>Love shattered pride</i>

880
01:49:21,942 --> 01:49:23,902
<i>What once was innocence</i>

881
01:49:24,069 --> 01:49:26,529
<i>Turned on its side</i>

882
01:49:28,614 --> 01:49:30,824
<i>A cloud hangs over me</i>

883
01:49:31,033 --> 01:49:33,327
<i>Marks every move</i>

884
01:49:35,246 --> 01:49:38,207
<i>Deep in the memory of what once was love</i>

885
01:53:27,457 --> 01:53:30,461
I'll be back in a minute.

886
01:53:30,627 --> 01:53:32,171
One minute.

887
01:53:55,275 --> 01:53:57,152
No!

888
01:54:00,404 --> 01:54:02,032
No!

889
01:55:03,003 --> 01:55:06,131
Can someone help me?

890
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:09,344
Anybody, please?

891
01:55:11,304 --> 01:55:12,971
Can someone help me?
