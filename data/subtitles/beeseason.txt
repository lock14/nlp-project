<i>Oakland Tribune.</i> Oakland, California.



- Oppidan.
- Oppidan.



<i>My father told me once...</i>



<i>... that words and letters</i>
<i>hold all the secrets of the universe.</i>



<i>That in their shapes and sounds,</i>
<i>I could find everything...</i>



<i>... and see beyond myself</i>
<i>to something special.</i>



<i>Perfect.</i>



<i>My father told me once</i>
<i>that I could reach the ear of God.</i>



Eliza. Nozzle.



<i>From KQED Public Radio,</i>
<i>this is</i> The California Report.



<i>I'm Scott Shafer. On today's show,</i>
<i>people from all over the country are...</i>



<i>Thousands of California</i>
<i>supermarket clerks are on...</i>



<i>Seventy thousand union workers</i>
<i>at Vons...</i>



- <i>walked off the job late Saturday</i>
<i>after contract negotiations fell through.</i>



Ron says the Alfa's gonna be ready
this afternoon.



- Great.
- So I'll pick it up...



...and stop for groceries. Okay.



Hey. Hey, what are you doing?
That's my breakfast.



This is terrible stuff.
How do you eat this?



- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see you.



- Bye. Thanks for the ride.
- Okay, bye-bye.



Got your lunch?



- Bye, sweetheart. I'll call after school.
- Okay.



- Okay, bye-bye.
- Thanks, Mom.



Hey, wait up!



- <i>Eliza, let's try "possibility."</i>
- <i>Possibility.</i>



<i>P-O-S-S-I-B-I...</i>



...L-I-T-Y. Possibility.
- Correct.



Courtney. Graphite.



Correct.



- <i>...O-R-O-W.</i>
- <i>That's incorrect.</i>



- <i>...L-I-S...</i>
- <i>Incorrect.</i>



<i>I'm sorry, you're excused.</i>



- Placebo.
- P-L-A...



- Random.
...D-O-M.



l-N...



- Flux.
- Flux.



- <i>Fluorescent.</i>
- <i>F-L-U-O...</i>



- <i>Archaeology.</i>
- <i>A-R-C-H-A-E-O-L-O-G-Y.</i>



Yeah, but who's gonna be handl...?
Who do we have this year?



We've got Lewis, Thomas, Luka.



"Aspects of Biblical Religion."
Ron usually takes that...



...and he can do it again.



One-ninety, " Topics
in Religious Studies, the Upanishads."



Now, I could do that, or...



On the stove.



You know that dinner of yours?
You used every pot in the house.



That wasn't worth
washing a pot or two?



Or 10.



Hey, what's this?



He's helping Elly with Hebrew school.



- You understand a word you're saying?
- I understand a lot of it.



Yeah? Okay. Translate it, hotshot.



- It's about where Abraham sacrifices...
- No, not sacrifices.



- Starts...
- Yes?



...to sacrifice Isaac to God?
- You're being a bully.



A bully? Maybe.



But why shouldn't he know
what he's saying?



Isn't God in the words?
Actually, God is the words.



The spoken words, the utterances.



How do we reach the ear
of God, Aaron?



Exactly. We speak with him. Ridiculous.
Most Jews don't understand...



...what they're saying in services.
- Well, that's what attracted me...



...the mystery of it all.



- I thought it was Dad's cooking.
- Very clever.



You missed a spot. You're slipping.



Come on, let's go. Let's play.
Let's go. Come on.



We'll finish this later.



Hey, what do you think
about changing...?



I love this piece.
You been working on this?



Good night, honey.



- Hey.
- Could you drive me somewhere?



So, what is this, again?



I told you already,
the district spelling bee.



Don't you have to win your school bee
or something to be in that?



God, Elly, that's great, wow.



I'm totally impressed.
Dad must be in dad heaven.



- He doesn't care.
- How can you say that?



- He loves this stuff.
- I put the letter under his door...



...he never said anything.



- I'm sorry.
- <i>Spelling bee...</i>



<i>... is a truly American tradition.</i>



<i>I'd like to welcome you</i>
<i>to the</i> Oakland Tribune <i>district bee.</i>



Spellers, be proud.



You are examples of the best
and brightest in our area.



Sequel.



Sequel.



S-E-Q-U-E-L.



Correct.



Orangutan.



- O...
- Turpitude.



Fresco. Homonym.



Hom... Homonym.



H-O-M-O...



...N-Y-M.
- Correct.



Coyote.



- Coyote. C-O-Y...
- Affix.



Susurration. Dendroid. Extenuate.
Notorious. Anvil. Hydrofoil. Graduates.



- Oasis.
- Hoodlum.



Macramé.



M-A-C...



...R-A-M...



- A-Y?
- Incorrect.



<i>S-A-L...</i>



...l-N-E. Saline.



So our paradox: God is everything.



A perfect, luminous essence.



But even God wants more.
To experience more, to give.



So God creates a vessel,
a container that can receive this gift...



...of God's pure light.



- This divine light pours into the vessel.
- Come stand here.



The vessel, of course, can't contain the
magnitude of this light, and it shatters...



...destroying the vessel
and scattering its broken shards...



...in a big bang of creation.



Now, man's job is to locate...



...and gather these shards
to make the vessel...



...our world, whole again.



Now, the Kabbalists call this fixing...
This mending, they called it...



<i>..."tikkun."</i>



<i>"Tikkun olam,"</i> the fixing of the world.



Any act of goodness, altruism, kindness
that contributes to that idea...



...is considered <i>tikkun olam.</i>



It's an extraordinary idea, that we can
restore what has been shattered.



In fact, it's our responsibility to try,
each of us.



Out of the very pieces
of the destruction, God has left us hope.



Polytheism papers due next Tuesday.



<i>Elly, this is fantastic.</i>
<i>Why didn 't you tell me?</i>



- I did, but you didn't say anything.
- She thinks you've been ignoring it.



- I put the letter under your door.
- What letter, honey?



From Dr. Morris.



- Dr. Morris?
- Probably in the mess on your floor, Dad.



- I'm really sorry. I didn't see that letter.
- She beat out a lot of kids.



- Yeah?
- You'd have loved it.



Did you do that? Oh, man.



I got another chance now, don't I?
You moved up to the next level, right?



- The regional bee in Sacramento.
- Oh, perfect.



Perfect. We'll all go.
This is really, really important.



And this...



...this is a beautiful thing.



Let's take this home.
We'll show it to your mom, all right?



We'll put the top down on the Alfa.
What a great day.



It's okay. Go with Dad.



I'll see you at home.



Okay. It's in the <i>Chronicle,</i>
<i>The Trib,</i> and <i>The Montclarion.</i>



Listen to this, " Winner of the area's
spelling bee that took place...



...Saturday afternoon at Albany High
School was sixth-grader Eliza Naumann."



- "Sixth-grader bests middle-schoolers."
- Let me see.



- That's great. I'm proud of you.
- "Naumann casts a spell."



- You've always been good at spelling.
- Yeah, but not this good.



- It's not that important.
- Of course it's important, Elly.



There are people who believe that letters
are an expression of a very special...



...primal energy, and when
they combine to make words...



...they hold all the secrets
of the universe.



Remember the Vikings?
Okay, Vikings called this <i>aepli.</i>



Now, when they took it across the sea
in their ships, it became <i>apfel.</i>



Crossed another border,
it became <i>appel.</i>



By the time it got to us,
it was "apple."



A-P-P-L-E.
Its spelling contains all of that.



It holds its history inside it.



Yeah, but that's not the secret
of the universe.



Isn't it?



"Miss Naumann, youngest district
spelling champion ever."



Did you know that?



Mimi. Mim? We're all going
to Sacramento next month.



Come on, honey, let's take a picture.
Excuse me...



Everybody.



Smile.



- There you go.
- Okay, thanks a lot.



- Lorgnette.
- Lorgnette.



L-O-R-G-N-E-T-T-E?



Correct.



- Dandelion.
- Dandelion.



D...



...A...



...N...



...D...



...E-L-I...



...O...



...N.



- Dandelion.
- Correct.



- Daguerreotype.
- Daguerreotype.



Incorrect.



- Chiliastic.
- Chiliastic.



- Inchoate.
- Inchoate.



Correct.



Suture. Iridian. Gnomic. Staccato.
Pharmacopoeia.



- Glissando.
- Glissando.



G-L-I...



...S...



...A-N-D-O. Glissando.



I'm afraid that's incorrect,
but don't leave the stage.



If number 26 misspells her word,
the bee will continue.



If she spells it correctly,
she'll be the winner.



Number 26, your word is batik.



- Batik?
- Batik.



Batik.



Yes!



That's my girl.
I can't believe it. Great.



- I brought you a glass of water.
- Thanks.



Here you go.



- Is that my old suitcase?
- Dad gave it to me for the state bee.



I didn't know we still had it.



My parents bought it for me
when I went to boarding school.



Were you scared?



At boarding school.



No, I was already about your age.



There was nothing to be scared of.



Why'd they send you?



That's what people did.



Were you there...



...when they died?



Yeah. Yeah, I was at school.



This is for you, Elly. It was mine.



My mother gave it to me.



- What is it?
- Oh, no, no. Oh, no, don't... Don't...



It doesn't come apart.
It's a kaleidoscope.



You look through it and see things.



Hold it towards the light.
Like that. Yeah.



Turn it.



I used to carry it with me.



I love the way it holds the light.



Do you see that?



Elly...



...when you're trying
to spell a word...



...what happens to you?



I mean, when you close your eyes.



I start out hearing it in my head...



...in the voice of whoever said it.



Then the voice changes
into something else...



...the word's voice.



And then I can see it.



What?



The word. I can see the word.



Mom?



Go to sleep.



Good night, Mom.



What you did today at the bee...



...it was...



...remarkable.



Good night.



- <i>Were you there when they died?</i>
- <i>Were you there when they died?</i>



<i>Were you scared?</i>



<i>I got two tickets to paradise</i>
<i>Pack your bags we leave tonight</i>



I'm tired. I'm tired.



You know,
Elly's never had anything like this.



<i>I used to carry it with me.</i>



Mimi. Mimi.



Hey, sweetheart.



You look like you could use a snack.
I cut up some cheese here.



You can have a cookie if you want...



...but all that sugar, you'll probably
crash later on. Protein's better.



How come you're home?



I came home to be with you.



Come on in. Come on.



Come on in.



You know, I thought this could be
our study area. Right here.



Now, we don't have as much time
as I'd like...



...but I think we can get through
a lot before the state bee.



And then hopefully we'll have
another chance before the nationals.



What do you think? You know,
it'd be like you were one of my students.



I'm pretty good at this kind of thing,
you know.



That's Mom.



- Hi.
- Hi, honey. Are you okay?



- Dad's here. We're in his room.
- Dad?



<i>He's gonna help me study.</i>



He wants to talk to you.



- I'll see you later.
- <i>Okay.</i>



- Bye.
- Bye.



- Okay. Hey.
- <i>Hi. What's going on?</i>



I just rearranged some office hours
so you don't have to rush home.



- <i>Anything wrong?</i>
- No, I'm fine. I'm just...



- Look, make sure she has...
- It's okay. We're having a good time.



Okay. Okay, bye.



<i>What happens to you</i>
<i>when you close your eyes?</i>



<i>When you close your eyes.</i>



<i>Do you see what I see?</i>



<i>What happens to you, Elly,</i>
<i>when you close your eyes?</i>



- <i>Do you see what I see?</i>
- <i>... what I see.</i>



<i>In the world...</i>



- <i>... in the light.</i>
- <i>Light.</i>



<i>In everything around us.</i>



<i>Here.</i>



Hey.



- You all right?
- I'm fine.



Yeah? I expected you hours ago.
Where you been?



I was starting to worry.
Called your cell, you didn't answer.



- Oh, I forgot to charge it.
- Oh, right.



Phil asked me
to co-author the Lancet paper.



I guess he wants someone
to wash his petri dishes.



I thought you only washed my dishes.



- There's food here.
- Thanks, I got something.



Aaron. Aaron.
Not so loud, Elly's studying.



I want you to write the letters.



All right, I'm gonna start you off here.
You gotta keep your eyes closed, okay?



Take a deep breath.



And just say the letters to yourself.



The whole thing,
backwards and forwards.



Relax. Just...
Just concentrate on the letters.



Good. Good, keep going.



Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y-Z...



Open your mind to the letters, Elly.
Concentrate. Feel each one in your mind.



Let them flow through you,
from your hand to the pad.



Okay. You can stop.



That was wonderful.
Really wonderful.



I didn't do it.



You know, it's not what they look like,
it's what they feel like.



You were perfect. Okay, I'd like us to try
something else now, a little bit different.



Now I want you to close your eyes,
take a deep breath.



And now I want you to open your mind
to all the words in the universe...



...that contain the letter E.



E...



- Two chocolate Kwik shakes.
- Okay.



Really good.



- Is this our champion?
- That's my girl.



- Elly, this is John.
- Hi.



<i>I brought you here, Elly...</i>



<i>... because I want us to start thinking</i>
<i>about something beyond just spelling...</i>



<i>... beyond letters and words.</i>



<i>You know that to become a professor,</i>
<i>I had to write a thesis, kind of a book.</i>



<i>I wrote about something very special.</i>
<i>About Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism.</i>



And one of the most famous of
the Jewish mystics was a man called...



...Avraham Abulafia.



What's a mystic?



A mystic is a person who believes...



...that you can talk,
really connect, with God.



Not just pray, but have God listen.



And sometimes,
in special cases, have God talk back.



- Aaron sings to God. I've heard him.
- Yeah, well, we all can do things...



...in praise of God.
Write poetry. Simply pray.



But I'm talking about
something more...



...something that almost
no one can do.



Something beyond words.



What?



Let God flow through you.



Abulafia believed
that by concentrating on letters...



...the mind could be opened up...



...and reach what he called <i>shefa.</i>



What?



The most special way
of being together with God.



Steps to getting there
are in these books.



- Exercises with words and letters.
- Like what we've been doing.



Yes, exactly. Let me show you.



Elly.



Elly?



Elly.



Bad dream?



I have a present for you.



It was mine when I was your age.



But we'll pick something up before
you leave tomorrow if it doesn't fit.



Get dressed for school now. Okay?



Thanks, Mom.



- Hey. Hey, what's up? I'm late.
- Nothing.



- I was returning your Brodsky.
- Oh, I forgot about that.



Could you put it on top of my desk?
I gotta go. See you.



Okay.



- Bye.
- Bye.



Have mercy on us all.
Make us worthy to share eternal life...



...with Mary the virgin mother of God...
- Oh, sorry.



...with the Apostles
and with all the saints...



...who have done your will
throughout the ages.



May we praise you
in union with them...



...and give you glory through your son,
Jesus Christ.



This, the lamb of God,
takes away the sins of the world...



...and happy are those
who have been called to his supper.



The body of Christ.



Dad...



...is God red?



Red?



No.



- The support about which a lever pivots.
- Fulcrum.



I've almost got it.



- F-U-L-C-R-U-M.
- Well done, Elly Belly.



Okay. Puerile.



Maybe that's enough spelling
for now.



Okay. Earth to Aaron. Come in, Aaron.



- What?
- So how about it? What do you think?



- How about what?
- I asked you 10 minutes ago.



Think you and Mom will survive a few
days while we're at the state finals?



Yeah. Well, sure, whatever.



Aaron, you didn't eat anything.



Thought he liked my cooking.



Okay, 713. This way.



It's on this side.



Here it is.



Wow, look at this.



Adjoining rooms. Pretty cool.



Why don't you pick one, honey.



- Which one do you want?
- This one, I think.



Take the other one, it's got
a better view. You'll like it better.



You wanna practice a little?



Good.



<i>Tiger.</i>



Tiger.



Come here. Come on.
Sorry about her.



Don't worry about it.



- So are you?
- What?



A Hindu.



No.



- Too many gods?
- Yeah, something like that.



- I'm Chali.
- Aaron.



- Nice to meet you.
- You too.



- School stuff?
- No, just checking it out.



Something's missing.



How do you mean?



From your life.



Yeah, I guess.



I used to feel that way.



I was raised a Catholic,
but it felt like empty ritual.



Yeah, my mom was Catholic.



And she converted
when she met my dad. We're Jewish.



- Can I give you something to read?
- Yeah, sure.



- My number's on the back.
- Awesome.



- Well, it was nice to meet you, Aaron.
- Yeah, you too.



Come on, you.



Bye, Kali.



- Chali.
- Chali.



<i>That is correct, except you've omitted</i>
<i>the last and most important word...</i>



<i>Thirty-day...</i>



It's 9:30.



- You're not riding with me?
- I've got some stuff to do after school.



- You...? You sure?
- Yeah.



<i>Hi, you've reached Saul Naumann. Leave</i>
<i>me a message, and I'll get back to you.</i>



Selenic.



Selenic.



<i>S-E-L-L-E-N...</i>



...l- C.



Selenic.



That's incorrect.



Cumulus.



Cumulus.



Hi, I'm here to see Chali.



<i>Here. Is it here?</i>



<i>Is it the light here? The air?</i>



<i>The noise? The dirt?</i>



<i>Everything. Everything here?</i>



<i>Everything.</i>



<i>God has left us hope.</i>
<i>God has left us hope...</i>



- E-E-N. Duvetyn.



That's incorrect.



Cotyledon.



- Cotyledon?
- That is correct. Cotyledon.



May I have a definition, please?



A cotyledon is the primary
or embryonic leaf or leaves of a seedling.



- What is the derivation, please?
- Cotyledon comes to us from the Greek.



C-O...



...T...



...Y...



...L...



...E...



...D-O-N.



Cotyledon.



Correct.



- Hey. You're late.
- Mom knew.



Well, she's late too.



Guess what. Your sister won.
She's going to the nationals.



- Yeah?
- Washington, D.C.



I'm cooking a victory dinner.



Evening, champ.
What'll it be, broccoli or beans?



I know, but you gotta eat
something green.



- Do you want a...? Congratulations.
- Thanks.



- What happened while we were gone?
- Nothing.



Nothing? Something's gotta happen
in three days.



- Not really.
- No?



- I left a sonata on your bed before I left.
- Yeah, I found it.



You wanna give it
a try tomorrow, maybe?



I'm going out for pizza
and a movie tomorrow.



There wouldn't be a girl involved in this
pizza-movie venture, would there?



- No, there wouldn't.
- You don't have to be embarrassed...



...about going on a date.
- It's not a date.



- So...
- Okay.



I've got homework.



- Dinner in an hour.
- Yeah, fine.



- Mim, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.



- Mom.
- Yes?



I think the blouse is lucky.
I'm gonna wear it for nationals.



Elly, you startled me.
I didn't know you were still up.



- I was watching TV.
- Let's put you to bed.



I love you, Mom.



Me too.



You go to sleep now.



I love you, Elly.



We're not alone, any of us.



We can make connections.



<i>Tikkun olam?</i>



Yes. We can fix what's been broken.



- We can make things whole again.
- Gathering shards.



Yes. Together.



Hold me. Please hold me.



- How about this one?
- Okay, thanks.



Sure I can't tempt you, Aaron?
It's really good.



- That's just my ride.
- We only need three.



- That's perfect. Thanks.
- Okay.



- I'd like to meet your friend.
- Maybe next time.



There's a girl at the gate.



Hi.



- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.



- Hi.
- Hello.



Aaron, introduce your guest here.



- Hi, I'm Aaron's dad.
- That's Chali.



- Chali.
- Chali?



Yeah, Chali.



- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.



Want some chicken before you go?
I'm famous for the sauce.



- She doesn't want any.
- No, let her answer for herself.



- Actually, I don't eat chicken.
- Why not?



Because I'm a vegetarian.



- Interesting. I was a vegetarian once.
- Okay, let's go. Come on.



- It was nice to meet you all.
- Okay.



Bye.



- Nice meeting you.
- Have fun.



Come again. I grill a mean tofu.



- Bye.
- See you later.



Okay, my translation. This notebook
is my translation of Abulafia's words.



It's his guide, Elly, for reaching <i>shefa.</i>



"Cleanse your heart and soul.
Permute the letters back and forth.



This will arouse in you many words,
one after the other.



You will feel then as if
an additional spirit is within you.



You will experience ecstasy
and trembling.



In this manner,
you will reach beyond yourself.



Go slowly, as the path is dangerous
and must be traveled with caution."



- I'd like us to try this.
- What?



A permutation.



Other people have tried to do these...



...but almost no one has felt
that special feeling that he wrote about.



I haven't been able to do it.



I tried. It was very important to me,
but I couldn't.



But I think maybe you can.
I think you have what Abulafia had.



I saw it on the stage at the bee.



I think you can use his methods
to achieve <i>shefa...</i>



...to reach the ear of God.



Let me show you what I mean.
Let's permute the word "earth."



What's inside this word? Earth.



- Heart. Rathe.
- Like in Boggle.



Yeah, except the combinations...



...don't have to mean anything
in the usual sense.



Try another one.



You do it. Library.



<i>Make yourself write.</i>
<i>Cleanse your heart and soul.</i>



<i>Permute the letters back and forth.</i>



<i>You will feel then</i>
<i>as if an additional spirit is within you.</i>



<i>In this manner,</i>
<i>you will reach beyond yourself.</i>



<i>In this manner,</i>
<i>you will reach beyond yourself.</i>



<i>Go slowly, as the path is dangerous</i>
<i>and must be traveled with caution.</i>



Yeah?



- It's me.
- Hey.



- She was nice.
- Thanks.



It smells nice in here.



I'm sorry I'm late.



Where were you?



- Miriam?
- I'm just tired, and I wanna go to sleep.



Will there be supervision?



I took the blue sleeping bag.



All right.



- Hi. Aaron's going camping.
- Just for the weekend.



Mom said it was okay.



- Alone?
- No, with the Sierra Club.



- Bye.
- Bye. Thanks a lot.



Bye.



I like camping.



<i>Elly, I want you to take</i>
<i>one simple, easy breath...</i>



...and draw the sound out
from very deep inside of you...



...until you can taste it completely.



And when you're ready,
just let your body move.



What's wrong?



Why do you look like that?



- Dad?
- You move the way Abulafia described it.



I wanna do more.



Remember what I told you?



- We're gonna take our time with this.
- Okay.



If we go too fast,
this could be dangerous.



Now, what we're doing here
is a very special kind of knowledge.



The words in this notebook
are very powerful.



We'll see how it goes
after the nationals.



It... It feels so light.



Yeah. Yeah, light.



All right, just one more time.



- Hello.
- Hello.



I'm really happy here, Chali.



- Oh, dear. Why didn't you wake me?
- I just found you here.



You're bleeding. What is this?



I must've bumped my head
on the table.



- How did you do that?
- I don't know.



- Hey, what's going on, Mim?
- Nothing.



Nothing?



Is there something
you wanna tell me?



What?



I don't know what you're doing,
I don't know where you've been.



I don't know where you went.
I don't know anything.



I'm sorry.



- What's the matter with Mom?
- She just fell asleep here, honey.



- In the kitchen?
- Yeah, she's okay. She's okay.



Your brother's coming home tonight.
We're gonna...



We're gonna have a nice family dinner.



- Hey.
- Hey. Back from the wilderness.



- All in one piece.
- Yeah.



See the article on Elly today?
In the paper.



- No.
- About her going to the national bee.



So how about you?
Sacrifice any virgins out there?



Hey.



She's been gone all day.



She didn't take the car.



And in the morning...



...her head was bleeding.



You saw that?
Her head was bleeding?



Elly...



...if I tell you something,
will you promise to keep it to yourself?



I didn't go camping.



Where did you go?



To a place for people
who wanna get closer to God.



Dad wants to get closer to God.



Yeah, well...



Do you like it better there?



Hello.



Yes, this is Mr. Naumann.
Yes, Saul Naumann.



Look...



...your mother's been...



I'll call you as soon as I know
everything, okay?



Is it because of my spelling?



It has nothing to do with you.



Go to sleep.



What is this?



It's the address your wife gave
as her place of residence.



She had the key in her pocket.



Manager says she's had the space
for years.



We're looking into how much
of this stuff is stolen.



- Mind if I smoke?
- No.



She's in the hospital.



She was exhausted,
sick and confused.



Can I see her?



Some hospitals have rules
about children.



- But I'll see later when I get there.
- Will she get better?



Yeah. Yeah, of course she will. Yes.



- Aren't you riding with us?
- I got some stuff to do before school.



You didn't eat anything yet.



Goodbye.



- Bye, EI.
- Bye.



- Maybe we'll try some takeout tonight.
- Yeah, maybe.



Did you see it?



- Yes.
- It's beautiful, isn't it?



I've never seen anything like it.



It's beginning to hold the light.



- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- The shards, putting them together.



<i>Tikkun olam,</i>
to make things whole.



Hold the light.



You showed me.



Miriam, it was a metaphor.



A poem.



Yes, a poem. I made a poem.



The police think that you took
all those things.



- Some of them are mine. Ours.
- Some aren't.



I needed more.



They said they found you
in another family's house.



I need you to come home, honey.
The kids need you to come home.



- I don't wanna come home right now.
- They're not gonna prosecute.



They just wanna make sure
that you get some help.



Say you're sorry that you took the things
that didn't belong to you.



- I'm not sorry. I wasn't stealing.
- Miriam, please. Just...



- I thought maybe you'd understand.
- I do understand. I do.



- But I need you to come home.
- Stop it. You don't understand.



I can't go with you now, Saul.



Look at me.



What do you see?



You...



You love to talk.



Talk about things that don't...
That don't come from your heart.



You talk and talk and talk and talk.



Are they all empty words?



Do you want to understand?



Understand me. This.



That room, those things...



...it wasn't...



Miriam, please. Please talk to me.



I'm sorry. I'm sorry.



- I wanna go back to my room, please.
- Tell me what's wrong. Please?



I just wanted to hold the light,
that's all.



I didn't do this to hurt you.



She took some things
she thought were hers, but they weren't.



- The doctors are working with her now.
- She said she didn't wanna see me?



Elly, she's really not ready
to see anybody right now.



She took all that stuff,
and now we can't go to the finals.



What are you talking about?



Who told you we're not going?



It's my fault, isn't it?
That's why she's sick.



No, that's...



That's not why she's sick.



It is nobody's fault, all right?



We'll go to the finals,
and your mother will watch.



It's on TV.
We'll tell her about it, okay?



All right.



Okay?



I'm sorry.



Yeah. Aaron, where are you?



No. No, they're keeping her
in the hospital.



I'll explain when you get home.



Of course you will be coming home.
Where are you?



Aaron.



Where...?



I can't deal with this now.



Shit.



Who...? Where am I calling?



The what?



All right, stay in the car.



- I've come for my son.
- Yes.



If you don't give him to me,
I will call the police.



- Come in.
- All right.



Aaron.



- All right, get dressed. We're going home.
- I am dressed.



Then let's go.



- You can't keep me from coming back.
- Watch me.



- I really can't believe you did this.
- Get in the car.



You're acting like a child.
Eliza has more sense...



Of course you'd think that.
She agrees with everything you say.



I'm not finished.
Don't walk away from your father.



- You'll stop me from going to my room?
- Come back.



- You do not get to tell me what to do.
- Stop...



- Stop it.
- I'm not Eliza.



- You do not talk to me like that!
- No. You don't fucking control me!



She's not even in the hospital, is she?



She got tired of being here. Tired of you
and your house and your cooking...



...and your religion and your everything.
And you just can't face the truth.



You wanna know the truth, Aaron?



Your mother has been stealing things
for years, maybe her whole life.



She's very sick.
She's in a mental institution...



...and I don't know when or if
they will give her back to me.



You're the one who's sick.



- Me?
- Yeah, you.



Who's the one who's walking around
in a sheet?



- An orange bed sheet.
- Stop it.



- Aaron, you are a baby. You're a kid.
- Stop it. Stop it.



You wanna go to...? Go to your room.
Go to your fucking room. Go.



Why can't you live your own stupid life?
Why drag me and Elly into it?



Why can't you leave us alone?



Aaron.



Aaron.



Please, God. Please.



<i>We can talk...</i>



<i>... really connect, with God.</i>



<i>Not just pray...</i>



<i>... but have God listen.</i>



<i>And sometimes, in special cases...</i>



<i>... have God talk back.</i>



Okay, this way.

that she knows I called.

Hey, you were incredible
up there today.



Thanks.



- What's your brother doing?
- Watching TV.



You wanna try a few more,
just to keep loose?

- He should leave you alone.
- It's okay.



He just wants this for himself.



He's using you like he used Mom,
like he used me.



I just think you should forget about him,
that's all I mean.



He needs this, all the attention
and the control.



And he doesn't even know it.



He needs Mom.



What are you doing down here
this time of night?



I wanna see the television cameras.



You in that spelling contest
tomorrow?



- I don't see them.
- The cameras?



I guess they don't bring them
till the morning.



You better get back to sleep before
your mother comes here looking for you.



- She won't. I need to win first.
- Don't be silly.



Nobody's mother
needs her to win anything.

It's 7:30.
We've gotta get you cleaned up.

<i>And we would be together.</i>



She's my daughter.
