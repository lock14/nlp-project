<i>Oakland Tribune.</i> Oakland, California.

00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,634
- Oppidan.
- Oppidan.

4
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,837
<i>My father told me once...</i>

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,835
<i>... that words and letters</i>
<i>hold all the secrets of the universe.</i>

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,028
<i>That in their shapes and sounds,</i>
<i>I could find everything...</i>

7
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,676
<i>... and see beyond myself</i>
<i>to something special.</i>

8
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,278
<i>Perfect.</i>

9
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,750
<i>My father told me once</i>
<i>that I could reach the ear of God.</i>

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,834
Eliza. Nozzle.

11
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,753
<i>From KQED Public Radio,</i>
<i>this is</i> The California Report.

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,390
<i>I'm Scott Shafer. On today's show,</i>
<i>people from all over the country are...</i>

13
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,954

<i>Seventy thousand union workers</i>

15
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,593
- <i>walked off the job late Saturday</i>
<i>after contract negotiations fell through.</i>

16
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,475
Ron says the Alfa's gonna be ready
this afternoon.

17
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,557
- Great.
- So I'll pick it up...

18
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,432
...and stop for groceries. Okay.

19
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,552
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?
That's my breakfast.

20
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,752
This is terrible stuff.
How do you eat this?

21
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,155
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see you.

22
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,596
- Bye. Thanks for the ride.
- Okay, bye-bye.

23
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,157
Got your lunch?

24
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,914
- Bye, sweetheart. I'll call after school.
- Okay.

25
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,799
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Thanks, Mom.

26
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,275
Hey, wait up!

27
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,631
- <i>Eliza, let's try "possibility."</i>
- <i>Possibility.</i>

28
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,396
<i>P-O-S-S-I-B-I...</i>

29
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,593
...L-I-T-Y. Possibility.
- Correct.

30
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,879
Courtney. Graphite.

31
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,469
Correct.

32
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,471
- <i>...O-R-O-W.</i>
- <i>That's incorrect.</i>

33
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,596
- <i>...L-I-S...</i>
- <i>Incorrect.</i>

34
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,990
<i>I'm sorry, you're excused.</i>

35
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,952
- Placebo.
- P-L-A...

36
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,792
- Random.
...D-O-M.

37
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,756
l-N...

38
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,194
- Flux.
- Flux.

39
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,118
- <i>Fluorescent.</i>
- <i>F-L-U-O...</i>

40
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,753
- <i>Archaeology.</i>
- <i>A-R-C-H-A-E-O-L-O-G-Y.</i>

41
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,759
Yeah, but who's gonna be handl...?
Who do we have this year?

42
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,111
We've got Lewis, Thomas, Luka.

43
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,957
"Aspects of Biblical Religion."
Ron usually takes that...

44
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,870
...and he can do it again.

45
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,596
One-ninety, " Topics
in Religious Studies, the Upanishads."

46
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,671
Now, I could do that, or...

47
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,798
On the stove.

48
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,999
You know that dinner of yours?
You used every pot in the house.

49
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,189
That wasn't worth
washing a pot or two?

50
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,952
Or 10.

51
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,112
Hey, what's this?

52
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,073
He's helping Elly with Hebrew school.

53
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,472
- You understand a word you're saying?
- I understand a lot of it.

54
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,513
Yeah? Okay. Translate it, hotshot.

55
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,508
- It's about where Abraham sacrifices...
- No, not sacrifices.

56
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,119
- Starts...
- Yes?

57
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,393
...to sacrifice Isaac to God?
- You're being a bully.

58
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,670
A bully? Maybe.

59
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,195
But why shouldn't he know
what he's saying?

60
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,558
Isn't God in the words?
Actually, God is the words.

61
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,435
The spoken words, the utterances.

62
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,154
How do we reach the ear
of God, Aaron?

63
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,557
Exactly. We speak with him. Ridiculous.
Most Jews don't understand...

64
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,951
...what they're saying in services.
- Well, that's what attracted me...

65
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,553
...the mystery of it all.

66
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,917
- I thought it was Dad's cooking.
- Very clever.

67
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,830
You missed a spot. You're slipping.

68
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,315
Come on, let's go. Let's play.
Let's go. Come on.

69
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,556
We'll finish this later.

70
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,198
Hey, what do you think
about changing...?

71
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
I love this piece.
You been working on this?

72
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,916
Good night, honey.

73
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,391
- Hey.
- Could you drive me somewhere?

74
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,150
So, what is this, again?

75
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,515
I told you already,
the district spelling bee.

76
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,832
Don't you have to win your school bee
or something to be in that?

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,638
God, Elly, that's great, wow.

78
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,630
I'm totally impressed.
Dad must be in dad heaven.

79
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,831
- He doesn't care.
- How can you say that?

80
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,157
- He loves this stuff.
- I put the letter under his door...

81
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,510
...he never said anything.

82
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,039
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Spelling bee...</i>

83
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,872
<i>... is a truly American tradition.</i>

84
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,755
<i>I'd like to welcome you</i>
<i>to the</i> Oakland Tribune <i>district bee.</i>

85
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,235
Spellers, be proud.

86
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,671
You are examples of the best
and brightest in our area.

87
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,998
Sequel.

88
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,633
Sequel.

89
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,075
S-E-Q-U-E-L.

90
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,111
Correct.

91
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,873
Orangutan.

92
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,356
- O...
- Turpitude.

93
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,198
Fresco. Homonym.

94
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,755
Hom... Homonym.

95
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,272
H-O-M-O...

96
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,395
...N-Y-M.
- Correct.

97
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,437
Coyote.

98
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,995
- Coyote. C-O-Y...
- Affix.

99
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,557
Susurration. Dendroid. Extenuate.
Notorious. Anvil. Hydrofoil. Graduates.

100
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,988
- Oasis.
- Hoodlum.

101
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,950
Macramé.

102
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,512
M-A-C...

103
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,395
...R-A-M...

104
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,351
- A-Y?
- Incorrect.

105
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,109
<i>S-A-L...</i>

106
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,269
...l-N-E. Saline.

107
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,238
So our paradox: God is everything.

108
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,750
A perfect, luminous essence.

109
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,669
But even God wants more.
To experience more, to give.

110
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,271
So God creates a vessel,
a container that can receive this gift...

111
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,914
...of God's pure light.

112
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,396
- This divine light pours into the vessel.
- Come stand here.

113
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,712
The vessel, of course, can't contain the
magnitude of this light, and it shatters...

114
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,196
...destroying the vessel
and scattering its broken shards...

115
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,994
...in a big bang of creation.

116
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,990
Now, man's job is to locate...

117
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,351
...and gather these shards
to make the vessel...

118
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,189
...our world, whole again.

119
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,236
Now, the Kabbalists call this fixing...
This mending, they called it...

120
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,192
<i>..."tikkun."</i>

121
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,476
<i>"Tikkun olam,"</i> the fixing of the world.

122
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,030
Any act of goodness, altruism, kindness
that contributes to that idea...

123
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,430
...is considered <i>tikkun olam.</i>

124
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,759
It's an extraordinary idea, that we can
restore what has been shattered.

125
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,636
In fact, it's our responsibility to try,
each of us.

126
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,679
Out of the very pieces
of the destruction, God has left us hope.

127
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,638
Polytheism papers due next Tuesday.

128
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,759
<i>Elly, this is fantastic.</i>
<i>Why didn 't you tell me?</i>

129
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,714
- I did, but you didn't say anything.
- She thinks you've been ignoring it.

130
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,708
- I put the letter under your door.
- What letter, honey?

131
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,353
From Dr. Morris.

132
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,152
- Dr. Morris?
- Probably in the mess on your floor, Dad.

133
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,516
- I'm really sorry. I didn't see that letter.
- She beat out a lot of kids.

134
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,995
- Yeah?
- You'd have loved it.

135
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,478
Did you do that? Oh, man.

136
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,036
I got another chance now, don't I?
You moved up to the next level, right?

137
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,033
- The regional bee in Sacramento.
- Oh, perfect.

138
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,835
Perfect. We'll all go.
This is really, really important.

139
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,792
And this...

140
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,592
...this is a beautiful thing.

141
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,633
Let's take this home.
We'll show it to your mom, all right?

142
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,315
We'll put the top down on the Alfa.
What a great day.

143
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,669
It's okay. Go with Dad.

144
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,598
I'll see you at home.

145
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,316
Okay. It's in the <i>Chronicle,</i>
<i>The Trib,</i> and <i>The Montclarion.</i>

146
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,677
Listen to this, " Winner of the area's
spelling bee that took place...

147
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,070
...Saturday afternoon at Albany High
School was sixth-grader Eliza Naumann."

148
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,238
- "Sixth-grader bests middle-schoolers."
- Let me see.

149
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,153
- That's great. I'm proud of you.
- "Naumann casts a spell."

150
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,397
- You've always been good at spelling.
- Yeah, but not this good.

151
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,398
- It's not that important.
- Of course it's important, Elly.

152
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,116
There are people who believe that letters
are an expression of a very special...

153
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,312
...primal energy, and when
they combine to make words...

154
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,875
...they hold all the secrets
of the universe.

155
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,116
Remember the Vikings?
Okay, Vikings called this <i>aepli.</i>

156
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,154
Now, when they took it across the sea
in their ships, it became <i>apfel.</i>

157
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,436
Crossed another border,
it became <i>appel.</i>

158
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,114
By the time it got to us,
it was "apple."

159
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,393
A-P-P-L-E.
Its spelling contains all of that.

160
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,194
It holds its history inside it.

161
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,435
Yeah, but that's not the secret
of the universe.

162
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,232
Isn't it?

163
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,310
"Miss Naumann, youngest district
spelling champion ever."

164
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,431
Did you know that?

165
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,996
Mimi. Mim? We're all going
to Sacramento next month.

166
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,955
Come on, honey, let's take a picture.
Excuse me...

167
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,033
Everybody.

168
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,351
Smile.

169
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,680
- There you go.
- Okay, thanks a lot.

170
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,313
- Lorgnette.
- Lorgnette.

171
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:45,233
L-O-R-G-N-E-T-T-E?

172
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,793
Correct.

173
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,074
- Dandelion.
- Dandelion.

174
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,758
D...

175
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,278
...A...

176
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,517
...N...

177
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,311
...D...

178
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,710
...E-L-I...

179
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,238
...O...

180
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,118
...N.

181
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,272
- Dandelion.
- Correct.

182
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,878
- Daguerreotype.
- Daguerreotype.

183
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,798
Incorrect.

184
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,115
- Chiliastic.
- Chiliastic.

185
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,639
- Inchoate.
- Inchoate.

186
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,119
Correct.

187
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,673
Suture. Iridian. Gnomic. Staccato.
Pharmacopoeia.

188
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,877
- Glissando.
- Glissando.

189
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,671
G-L-I...

190
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,953
...S...

191
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,315
...A-N-D-O. Glissando.

192
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,553
I'm afraid that's incorrect,
but don't leave the stage.

193
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,469
If number 26 misspells her word,
the bee will continue.

194
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,752
If she spells it correctly,
she'll be the winner.

195
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,799
Number 26, your word is batik.

196
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,590
- Batik?
- Batik.

197
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,436
Batik.

198
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,438
Yes!

199
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,471
That's my girl.
I can't believe it. Great.

200
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,118
- I brought you a glass of water.
- Thanks.

201
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,833
Here you go.

202
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,630
- Is that my old suitcase?
- Dad gave it to me for the state bee.

203
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,990
I didn't know we still had it.

204
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,077
My parents bought it for me
when I went to boarding school.

205
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,917
Were you scared?

206
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,398
At boarding school.

207
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,674
No, I was already about your age.

208
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,714
There was nothing to be scared of.

209
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,596
Why'd they send you?

210
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,275
That's what people did.

211
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,879
Were you there...

212
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,756
...when they died?

213
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,190
Yeah. Yeah, I was at school.

214
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,670
This is for you, Elly. It was mine.

215
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,189
My mother gave it to me.

216
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,550
- What is it?
- Oh, no, no. Oh, no, don't... Don't...

217
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,910
It doesn't come apart.
It's a kaleidoscope.

218
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,590
You look through it and see things.

219
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,277
Hold it towards the light.
Like that. Yeah.

220
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,476
Turn it.

221
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,954
I used to carry it with me.

222
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,429
I love the way it holds the light.

223
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,432
Do you see that?

224
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,033
Elly...

225
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,118
...when you're trying
to spell a word...

226
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,838
...what happens to you?

227
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,793
I mean, when you close your eyes.

228
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,238
I start out hearing it in my head...

229
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,318
...in the voice of whoever said it.

230
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,594
Then the voice changes
into something else...

231
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,111
...the word's voice.

232
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,790
And then I can see it.

233
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,793
What?

234
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,158
The word. I can see the word.

235
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,399
Mom?

236
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,432
Go to sleep.

237
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,317
Good night, Mom.

238
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,398
What you did today at the bee...

239
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,956
...it was...

240
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,919
...remarkable.

241
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,193
Good night.

242
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,959
- <i>Were you there when they died?</i>
- <i>Were you there when they died?</i>

243
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,678
<i>Were you scared?</i>

244
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,996
<i>I got two tickets to paradise</i>
<i>Pack your bags we leave tonight</i>

245
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,596
I'm tired. I'm tired.

246
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,470
You know,
Elly's never had anything like this.

247
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,514
<i>I used to carry it with me.</i>

248
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,394
Mimi. Mimi.

249
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,315
Hey, sweetheart.

250
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,239
You look like you could use a snack.
I cut up some cheese here.

251
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,112
You can have a cookie if you want...

252
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,074
...but all that sugar, you'll probably
crash later on. Protein's better.

253
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,750
How come you're home?

254
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,475
I came home to be with you.

255
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,029
Come on in. Come on.

256
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,636
Come on in.

257
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,837
You know, I thought this could be
our study area. Right here.

258
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,395
Now, we don't have as much time
as I'd like...

259
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,678
...but I think we can get through
a lot before the state bee.

260
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,795
And then hopefully we'll have
another chance before the nationals.

261
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,514
What do you think? You know,
it'd be like you were one of my students.

262
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,117
I'm pretty good at this kind of thing,
you know.

263
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,238
That's Mom.

264
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,874
- Hi.
- Hi, honey. Are you okay?

265
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,991
- Dad's here. We're in his room.
- Dad?

266
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,519
<i>He's gonna help me study.</i>

267
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,273
He wants to talk to you.

268
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,311
- I'll see you later.
- <i>Okay.</i>

269
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,794
- Bye.
- Bye.

270
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,594
- Okay. Hey.
- <i>Hi. What's going on?</i>

271
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,031
I just rearranged some office hours
so you don't have to rush home.

272
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,153
- <i>Anything wrong?</i>
- No, I'm fine. I'm just...

273
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,717
- Look, make sure she has...
- It's okay. We're having a good time.

274
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,595
Okay. Okay, bye.

275
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,398
<i>What happens to you</i>
<i>when you close your eyes?</i>

276
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,551
<i>When you close your eyes.</i>

277
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,394
<i>Do you see what I see?</i>

278
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,431
<i>What happens to you, Elly,</i>
<i>when you close your eyes?</i>

279
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,749
- <i>Do you see what I see?</i>
- <i>... what I see.</i>

280
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,237
<i>In the world...</i>

281
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,637
- <i>... in the light.</i>
- <i>Light.</i>

282
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,953
<i>In everything around us.</i>

283
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,073
<i>Here.</i>

284
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,279
Hey.

285
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,160
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

286
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,079
Yeah? I expected you hours ago.
Where you been?

287
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,318
I was starting to worry.
Called your cell, you didn't answer.

288
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,160
- Oh, I forgot to charge it.
- Oh, right.

289
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,830
Phil asked me
to co-author the Lancet paper.

290
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,275
I guess he wants someone
to wash his petri dishes.

291
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,392
I thought you only washed my dishes.

292
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,714
- There's food here.
- Thanks, I got something.

293
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:55,233
Aaron. Aaron.
Not so loud, Elly's studying.

294
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,993
I want you to write the letters.

295
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,835
All right, I'm gonna start you off here.
You gotta keep your eyes closed, okay?

296
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,752
Take a deep breath.

297
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,393
And just say the letters to yourself.

298
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,677
The whole thing,
backwards and forwards.

299
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,629
Relax. Just...
Just concentrate on the letters.

300
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,751
Good. Good, keep going.

301
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,913
Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y-Z...

302
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,430
Open your mind to the letters, Elly.
Concentrate. Feel each one in your mind.

303
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,838
Let them flow through you,
from your hand to the pad.

304
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,312
Okay. You can stop.

305
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,717
That was wonderful.
Really wonderful.

306
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,156
I didn't do it.

307
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,711
You know, it's not what they look like,
it's what they feel like.

308
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,000
You were perfect. Okay, I'd like us to try
something else now, a little bit different.

309
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,112
Now I want you to close your eyes,
take a deep breath.

310
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,028
And now I want you to open your mind
to all the words in the universe...

311
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,549
...that contain the letter E.

312
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,796
E...

313
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,274
- Two chocolate Kwik shakes.
- Okay.

314
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,832
Really good.

315
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,551
- Is this our champion?
- That's my girl.

316
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,358
- Elly, this is John.
- Hi.

317
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,559
<i>I brought you here, Elly...</i>

318
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,474
<i>... because I want us to start thinking</i>
<i>about something beyond just spelling...</i>

319
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,551
<i>... beyond letters and words.</i>

320
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,558
<i>You know that to become a professor,</i>
<i>I had to write a thesis, kind of a book.</i>

321
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,998
<i>I wrote about something very special.</i>
<i>About Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism.</i>

322
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,034
And one of the most famous of
the Jewish mystics was a man called...

323
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,390
...Avraham Abulafia.

324
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,071
What's a mystic?

325
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,190
A mystic is a person who believes...

326
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,632
...that you can talk,
really connect, with God.

327
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,876
Not just pray, but have God listen.

328
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,392
And sometimes,
in special cases, have God talk back.

329
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,358
- Aaron sings to God. I've heard him.
- Yeah, well, we all can do things...

330
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,712
...in praise of God.
Write poetry. Simply pray.

331
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,949
But I'm talking about
something more...

332
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,355
...something that almost
no one can do.

333
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,915
Something beyond words.

334
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,833
What?

335
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,190
Let God flow through you.

336
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,438
Abulafia believed
that by concentrating on letters...

337
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,955
...the mind could be opened up...

338
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,153
...and reach what he called <i>shefa.</i>

339
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,959
What?

340
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,990
The most special way
of being together with God.

341
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,558
Steps to getting there
are in these books.

342
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,389
- Exercises with words and letters.
- Like what we've been doing.

343
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,357
Yes, exactly. Let me show you.

344
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,918
Elly.

345
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,478
Elly?

346
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,232
Elly.

347
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,231
Bad dream?

348
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,590
I have a present for you.

349
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,634
It was mine when I was your age.

350
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,275
But we'll pick something up before
you leave tomorrow if it doesn't fit.

351
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,877
Get dressed for school now. Okay?

352
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,359
Thanks, Mom.

353
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,999
- Hey. Hey, what's up? I'm late.
- Nothing.

354
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,840
- I was returning your Brodsky.
- Oh, I forgot about that.

355
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,560
Could you put it on top of my desk?
I gotta go. See you.

356
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,073
Okay.

357
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,157
- Bye.
- Bye.

358
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,949
Have mercy on us all.
Make us worthy to share eternal life...

359
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,674
...with Mary the virgin mother of God...
- Oh, sorry.

360
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,155
...with the Apostles
and with all the saints...

361
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,238
...who have done your will
throughout the ages.

362
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,755
May we praise you
in union with them...

363
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,112
...and give you glory through your son,
Jesus Christ.

364
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,790
This, the lamb of God,
takes away the sins of the world...

365
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,788
...and happy are those
who have been called to his supper.

366
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,317
The body of Christ.

367
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,793
Dad...

368
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,911
...is God red?

369
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,319
Red?

370
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,959
No.

371
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,358
- The support about which a lever pivots.
- Fulcrum.

372
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,152
I've almost got it.

373
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,991
- F-U-L-C-R-U-M.
- Well done, Elly Belly.

374
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,838
Okay. Puerile.

375
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,395
Maybe that's enough spelling
for now.

376
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,398
Okay. Earth to Aaron. Come in, Aaron.

377
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,990
- What?
- So how about it? What do you think?

378
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,555
- How about what?
- I asked you 10 minutes ago.

379
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,316
Think you and Mom will survive a few
days while we're at the state finals?

380
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,678
Yeah. Well, sure, whatever.

381
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,319
Aaron, you didn't eat anything.

382
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,877
Thought he liked my cooking.

383
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,157
Okay, 713. This way.

384
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,555
It's on this side.

385
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,512
Here it is.

386
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,792
Wow, look at this.

387
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,468
Adjoining rooms. Pretty cool.

388
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,034
Why don't you pick one, honey.

389
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,756
- Which one do you want?
- This one, I think.

390
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,668
Take the other one, it's got
a better view. You'll like it better.

391
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,310
You wanna practice a little?

392
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,509
Good.

393
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,998
<i>Tiger.</i>

394
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,832
Tiger.

395
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,875
Come here. Come on.
Sorry about her.

396
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,638
Don't worry about it.

397
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,434
- So are you?
- What?

398
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,638
A Hindu.

399
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,513
No.

400
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,753
- Too many gods?
- Yeah, something like that.

401
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,549
- I'm Chali.
- Aaron.

402
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,159
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

403
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,429
- School stuff?
- No, just checking it out.

404
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,873
Something's missing.

405
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,032
How do you mean?

406
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,432
From your life.

407
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,750
Yeah, I guess.

408
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,598
I used to feel that way.

409
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,588
I was raised a Catholic,
but it felt like empty ritual.

410
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,315
Yeah, my mom was Catholic.

411
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,993
And she converted
when she met my dad. We're Jewish.

412
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,879
- Can I give you something to read?
- Yeah, sure.

413
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,236
- My number's on the back.
- Awesome.

414
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,470
- Well, it was nice to meet you, Aaron.
- Yeah, you too.

415
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,393
Come on, you.

416
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,317
Bye, Kali.

417
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,869
- Chali.
- Chali.

418
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,632
<i>That is correct, except you've omitted</i>
<i>the last and most important word...</i>

419
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,789
<i>Thirty-day...</i>

420
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,392
It's 9:30.

421
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,189
- You're not riding with me?
- I've got some stuff to do after school.

422
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,271
- You...? You sure?
- Yeah.

423
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,479
<i>Hi, you've reached Saul Naumann. Leave</i>
<i>me a message, and I'll get back to you.</i>

424
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,998
Selenic.

425
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,837
Selenic.

426
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,593
<i>S-E-L-L-E-N...</i>

427
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,510
...l- C.

428
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,233
Selenic.

429
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,991
That's incorrect.

430
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,876
Cumulus.

431
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,317
Cumulus.

432
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,558
Hi, I'm here to see Chali.

433
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,196
<i>Here. Is it here?</i>

434
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,716
<i>Is it the light here? The air?</i>

435
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,596
<i>The noise? The dirt?</i>

436
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,192
<i>Everything. Everything here?</i>

437
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,672
<i>Everything.</i>

438
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,235
<i>God has left us hope.</i>
<i>God has left us hope...</i>

439
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,591
- E-E-N. Duvetyn.

440
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,356
That's incorrect.

441
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,237
Cotyledon.

442
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,396
- Cotyledon?
- That is correct. Cotyledon.

443
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,876
May I have a definition, please?

444
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,918
A cotyledon is the primary
or embryonic leaf or leaves of a seedling.

445
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,235
- What is the derivation, please?
- Cotyledon comes to us from the Greek.

446
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,312
C-O...

447
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,433
...T...

448
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,238
...Y...

449
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,311
...L...

450
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,677
...E...

451
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,077
...D-O-N.

452
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,316
Cotyledon.

453
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,873
Correct.

454
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,396
- Hey. You're late.
- Mom knew.

455
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,511
Well, she's late too.

456
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,719
Guess what. Your sister won.
She's going to the nationals.

457
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,997
- Yeah?
- Washington, D.C.

458
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,997
I'm cooking a victory dinner.

459
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,078
Evening, champ.
What'll it be, broccoli or beans?

460
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,271
I know, but you gotta eat
something green.

461
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,836
- Do you want a...? Congratulations.
- Thanks.

462
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,031
- What happened while we were gone?
- Nothing.

463
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,674
Nothing? Something's gotta happen
in three days.

464
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,472
- Not really.
- No?

465
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,195
- I left a sonata on your bed before I left.
- Yeah, I found it.

466
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,789
You wanna give it
a try tomorrow, maybe?

467
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,430
I'm going out for pizza
and a movie tomorrow.

468
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,230
There wouldn't be a girl involved in this
pizza-movie venture, would there?

469
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,113
- No, there wouldn't.
- You don't have to be embarrassed...

470
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,316
...about going on a date.
- It's not a date.

471
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,110
- So...
- Okay.

472
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,712
I've got homework.

473
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,756
- Dinner in an hour.
- Yeah, fine.

474
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,030
- Mim, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

475
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,639
- Mom.
- Yes?

476
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,713
I think the blouse is lucky.
I'm gonna wear it for nationals.

477
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,758
Elly, you startled me.
I didn't know you were still up.

478
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,315
- I was watching TV.
- Let's put you to bed.

479
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,438
I love you, Mom.

480
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,152
Me too.

481
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,111
You go to sleep now.

482
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,312
I love you, Elly.

483
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,549
We're not alone, any of us.

484
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,751
We can make connections.

485
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,678
<i>Tikkun olam?</i>

486
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,429
Yes. We can fix what's been broken.

487
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,951
- We can make things whole again.
- Gathering shards.

488
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,829
Yes. Together.

489
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,993
Hold me. Please hold me.

490
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,152
- How about this one?
- Okay, thanks.

491
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,796
Sure I can't tempt you, Aaron?
It's really good.

492
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,992
- That's just my ride.
- We only need three.

493
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,598
- That's perfect. Thanks.
- Okay.

494
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,758
- I'd like to meet your friend.
- Maybe next time.

495
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,196
There's a girl at the gate.

496
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,233
Hi.

497
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,156
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

498
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,711
- Hi.
- Hello.

499
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,358
Aaron, introduce your guest here.

500
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,312
- Hi, I'm Aaron's dad.
- That's Chali.

501
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,919
- Chali.
- Chali?

502
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,838
Yeah, Chali.

503
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,395
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

504
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,319
Want some chicken before you go?
I'm famous for the sauce.

505
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,438
- She doesn't want any.
- No, let her answer for herself.

506
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,795
- Actually, I don't eat chicken.
- Why not?

507
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,753
Because I'm a vegetarian.

508
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,714
- Interesting. I was a vegetarian once.
- Okay, let's go. Come on.

509
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,512
- It was nice to meet you all.
- Okay.

510
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,669
Bye.

511
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,558
- Nice meeting you.
- Have fun.

512
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,991
Come again. I grill a mean tofu.

513
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,236
- Bye.
- See you later.

514
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,390
Okay, my translation. This notebook
is my translation of Abulafia's words.

515
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,710
It's his guide, Elly, for reaching <i>shefa.</i>

516
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,357
"Cleanse your heart and soul.
Permute the letters back and forth.

517
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,556
This will arouse in you many words,
one after the other.

518
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,036
You will feel then as if
an additional spirit is within you.

519
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,789
You will experience ecstasy
and trembling.

520
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,992
In this manner,
you will reach beyond yourself.

521
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,751
Go slowly, as the path is dangerous
and must be traveled with caution."

522
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,350
- I'd like us to try this.
- What?

523
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,238
A permutation.

524
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,229
Other people have tried to do these...

525
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,560
...but almost no one has felt
that special feeling that he wrote about.

526
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,117
I haven't been able to do it.

527
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,029
I tried. It was very important to me,
but I couldn't.

528
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,400
But I think maybe you can.
I think you have what Abulafia had.

529
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,440
I saw it on the stage at the bee.

530
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,154
I think you can use his methods
to achieve <i>shefa...</i>

531
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,396
...to reach the ear of God.

532
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,475
Let me show you what I mean.
Let's permute the word "earth."

533
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,554
What's inside this word? Earth.

534
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,998
- Heart. Rathe.
- Like in Boggle.

535
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,758
Yeah, except the combinations...

536
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,718
...don't have to mean anything
in the usual sense.

537
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,359
Try another one.

538
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,036
You do it. Library.

539
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,677
<i>Make yourself write.</i>
<i>Cleanse your heart and soul.</i>

540
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,513
<i>Permute the letters back and forth.</i>

541
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,355
<i>You will feel then</i>
<i>as if an additional spirit is within you.</i>

542
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,670
<i>In this manner,</i>
<i>you will reach beyond yourself.</i>

543
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,400
<i>In this manner,</i>
<i>you will reach beyond yourself.</i>

544
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:31,396
<i>Go slowly, as the path is dangerous</i>
<i>and must be traveled with caution.</i>

545
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,599
Yeah?

546
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,515
- It's me.
- Hey.

547
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,716
- She was nice.
- Thanks.

548
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,917
It smells nice in here.

549
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,590
I'm sorry I'm late.

550
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,636
Where were you?

551
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,229
- Miriam?
- I'm just tired, and I wanna go to sleep.

552
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,792
Will there be supervision?

553
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,716
I took the blue sleeping bag.

554
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,399
All right.

555
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,991
- Hi. Aaron's going camping.
- Just for the weekend.

556
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,111
Mom said it was okay.

557
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,759
- Alone?
- No, with the Sierra Club.

558
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,032
- Bye.
- Bye. Thanks a lot.

559
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,753
Bye.

560
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,913
I like camping.

561
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,389
<i>Elly, I want you to take</i>
<i>one simple, easy breath...</i>

562
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,876
...and draw the sound out
from very deep inside of you...

563
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,114
...until you can taste it completely.

564
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,798
And when you're ready,
just let your body move.

565
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,591
What's wrong?

566
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,196
Why do you look like that?

567
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,116
- Dad?
- You move the way Abulafia described it.

568
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,356
I wanna do more.

569
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,518
Remember what I told you?

570
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,950
- We're gonna take our time with this.
- Okay.

571
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,031
If we go too fast,
this could be dangerous.

572
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,076
Now, what we're doing here
is a very special kind of knowledge.

573
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,829
The words in this notebook
are very powerful.

574
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,398
We'll see how it goes
after the nationals.

575
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,392
It... It feels so light.

576
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,720
Yeah. Yeah, light.

577
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,632
All right, just one more time.

578
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,912
- Hello.
- Hello.

579
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,589
I'm really happy here, Chali.

580
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,796
- Oh, dear. Why didn't you wake me?
- I just found you here.

581
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,595
You're bleeding. What is this?

582
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,156
I must've bumped my head
on the table.

583
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,590
- How did you do that?
- I don't know.

584
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,994
- Hey, what's going on, Mim?
- Nothing.

585
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,713
Nothing?

586
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,594
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

587
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,993
What?

588
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,078
I don't know what you're doing,
I don't know where you've been.

589
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,277
I don't know where you went.
I don't know anything.

590
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,871
I'm sorry.

591
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,390
- What's the matter with Mom?
- She just fell asleep here, honey.

592
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:59,752
- In the kitchen?
- Yeah, she's okay. She's okay.

593
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,351
Your brother's coming home tonight.
We're gonna...

594
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,437
We're gonna have a nice family dinner.

595
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,953
- Hey.
- Hey. Back from the wilderness.

596
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,751
- All in one piece.
- Yeah.

597
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,957
See the article on Elly today?
In the paper.

598
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,357
- No.
- About her going to the national bee.

599
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,118
So how about you?
Sacrifice any virgins out there?

600
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,873
Hey.

601
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,471
She's been gone all day.

602
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,718
She didn't take the car.

603
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,116
And in the morning...

604
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,116
...her head was bleeding.

605
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,515
You saw that?
Her head was bleeding?

606
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,278
Elly...

607
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:28,796
...if I tell you something,
will you promise to keep it to yourself?

608
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,551
I didn't go camping.

609
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,557
Where did you go?

610
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:45,030
To a place for people
who wanna get closer to God.

611
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,993
Dad wants to get closer to God.

612
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,514
Yeah, well...

613
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,999
Do you like it better there?

614
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,793
Hello.

615
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:19,157
Yes, this is Mr. Naumann.
Yes, Saul Naumann.

616
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,234
Look...

617
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,872
...your mother's been...

618
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,760
I'll call you as soon as I know
everything, okay?

619
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,954
Is it because of my spelling?

620
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,510
It has nothing to do with you.

621
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,078
Go to sleep.

622
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,558
What is this?

623
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,478
It's the address your wife gave
as her place of residence.

624
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,910
She had the key in her pocket.

625
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,592
Manager says she's had the space
for years.

626
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,034
We're looking into how much
of this stuff is stolen.

627
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,119
- Mind if I smoke?
- No.

628
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,396
She's in the hospital.

629
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:06,319
She was exhausted,
sick and confused.

630
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,073
Can I see her?

631
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,795
Some hospitals have rules
about children.

632
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,873
- But I'll see later when I get there.
- Will she get better?

633
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,958
Yeah. Yeah, of course she will. Yes.

634
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:30,030
- Aren't you riding with us?
- I got some stuff to do before school.

635
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,710
You didn't eat anything yet.

636
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,394
Goodbye.

637
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,596
- Bye, EI.
- Bye.

638
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,675
- Maybe we'll try some takeout tonight.
- Yeah, maybe.

639
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,835
Did you see it?

640
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,791
- Yes.
- It's beautiful, isn't it?

641
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,869
I've never seen anything like it.

642
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,753
It's beginning to hold the light.

643
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,914
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- The shards, putting them together.

644
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,112
<i>Tikkun olam,</i>
to make things whole.

645
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,792
Hold the light.

646
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,077
You showed me.

647
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,392
Miriam, it was a metaphor.

648
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,192
A poem.

649
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,310
Yes, a poem. I made a poem.

650
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,389
The police think that you took
all those things.

651
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:21,754
- Some of them are mine. Ours.
- Some aren't.

652
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,673
I needed more.

653
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,237
They said they found you
in another family's house.

654
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,439
I need you to come home, honey.
The kids need you to come home.

655
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,193
- I don't wanna come home right now.
- They're not gonna prosecute.

656
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,193
They just wanna make sure
that you get some help.

657
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,717
Say you're sorry that you took the things
that didn't belong to you.

658
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,156
- I'm not sorry. I wasn't stealing.
- Miriam, please. Just...

659
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,039
- I thought maybe you'd understand.
- I do understand. I do.

660
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,715
- But I need you to come home.
- Stop it. You don't understand.

661
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,711
I can't go with you now, Saul.

662
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,476
Look at me.

663
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,838
What do you see?

664
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,873
You...

665
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,630
You love to talk.

666
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:23,279
Talk about things that don't...
That don't come from your heart.

667
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,790
You talk and talk and talk and talk.

668
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,910
Are they all empty words?

669
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,834
Do you want to understand?

670
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,833
Understand me. This.

671
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,475
That room, those things...

672
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,398
...it wasn't...

673
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,080
Miriam, please. Please talk to me.

674
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,316
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

675
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,833
- I wanna go back to my room, please.
- Tell me what's wrong. Please?

676
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:09,077
I just wanted to hold the light,
that's all.

677
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,109
I didn't do this to hurt you.

678
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,996
She took some things
she thought were hers, but they weren't.

679
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,835
- The doctors are working with her now.
- She said she didn't wanna see me?

680
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,356
Elly, she's really not ready
to see anybody right now.

681
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,677
She took all that stuff,
and now we can't go to the finals.

682
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,676
What are you talking about?

683
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,471
Who told you we're not going?

684
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,959
It's my fault, isn't it?
That's why she's sick.

685
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,957
No, that's...

686
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,629
That's not why she's sick.

687
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,957
It is nobody's fault, all right?

688
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,998
We'll go to the finals,
and your mother will watch.

689
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,668
It's on TV.
We'll tell her about it, okay?

690
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,313
All right.

691
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,473
Okay?

692
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,999
I'm sorry.

693
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,919
Yeah. Aaron, where are you?

694
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,913
No. No, they're keeping her
in the hospital.

695
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,031
I'll explain when you get home.

696
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,551
Of course you will be coming home.
Where are you?

697
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,992
Aaron.

698
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,433
Where...?

699
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,914
I can't deal with this now.

700
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,639
Shit.

701
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,276
Who...? Where am I calling?

702
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,398
The what?

703
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,998
All right, stay in the car.

704
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,991
- I've come for my son.
- Yes.

705
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,112
If you don't give him to me,
I will call the police.

706
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,392
- Come in.
- All right.

707
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,392
Aaron.

708
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,635
- All right, get dressed. We're going home.
- I am dressed.

709
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,519
Then let's go.

710
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,115
- You can't keep me from coming back.
- Watch me.

711
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,392
- I really can't believe you did this.
- Get in the car.

712
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,594
You're acting like a child.
Eliza has more sense...

713
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,638
Of course you'd think that.
She agrees with everything you say.

714
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,149
I'm not finished.
Don't walk away from your father.

715
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,595
- You'll stop me from going to my room?
- Come back.

716
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,035
- You do not get to tell me what to do.
- Stop...

717
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,838
- Stop it.
- I'm not Eliza.

718
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,039
- You do not talk to me like that!
- No. You don't fucking control me!

719
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,029
She's not even in the hospital, is she?

720
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:22,438
She got tired of being here. Tired of you
and your house and your cooking...

721
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,350
...and your religion and your everything.
And you just can't face the truth.

722
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,239
You wanna know the truth, Aaron?

723
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:37,949
Your mother has been stealing things
for years, maybe her whole life.

724
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,515
She's very sick.
She's in a mental institution...

725
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:44,116
...and I don't know when or if
they will give her back to me.

726
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,158
You're the one who's sick.

727
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,072
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

728
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,840
Who's the one who's walking around
in a sheet?

729
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,718
- An orange bed sheet.
- Stop it.

730
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,832
- Aaron, you are a baby. You're a kid.
- Stop it. Stop it.

731
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:59,430
You wanna go to...? Go to your room.
Go to your fucking room. Go.

732
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,990
Why can't you live your own stupid life?
Why drag me and Elly into it?

733
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,991
Why can't you leave us alone?

I just think you should forget about him,
that's all I mean.

He needs this, all the attention

776

You better get back to sleep before
your mother comes here looking for you.

01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:52,718
<i>My father told me once</i>
<i>that I could reach the ear of God.</i>

885
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:57,436
<i>That words and letters would guide me</i>
<i>to reach beyond myself...</i>

886
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:01,038
<i>... to know the world as whole again.</i>

887
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,154
<i>And like the ancient mystics...</i>

888
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:07,318
<i>... God would flow through me.</i>

889
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,834
<i>And we would be together.</i>

890
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,749
