00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,786
Hail Mary, full of grace
The Lord is with you

2
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:16,340
Blessed are you among women
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus

3
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:20,414
Holy Mary, Mother of God
Pray for us sinners

4
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,224
Now and at the hour of our death ...

5
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:29,132
INTRODUCTION

6
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:39,135
In the 1890s, said that
prior to the death camps from France.

7
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:49,006
The victims were mostly children.
Pastors who spent days alone in the woods.

8
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,944
Those who saw the murderer and survived
describing it as a distortion of the shadow
wrapped in a blanket.

9
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:07,810
Their victims were not only killed,
but inexplicably maimed.

10
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:15,836
He violated the bodies and
stowed in a macabre scene.

11
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:25,508
In the words of the tabloid press and
in the minds of the superstitious of the city,
strange darkness was pure evil.

12
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:33,770
But bad as the explanation does not satisfy
a judge who investigated the crimes.

13
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:39,786
Using the tools of science,
tracing the path of death throughout the country.

14
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:47,659
Evidence and developed
a profile of the murderer.

15
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:52,662
So when a man was in custody,
guilt is established quickly.

16
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:04,533
Joseph Vach was hungry for fame.

17
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:13,970
Said he had been bitten by a rabid dog when
child and blamed the poison in his blood for his
homicidal behavior.

18
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:19,713
Every crime that was charged,
Vach freely confessed ...

19
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:26,713
provided that their stories dark
published in newspapers were hungry for scandals.

20
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:39,137
... Reduce their bellies.
When finished, put the body
hole in the backyard.

21
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:44,464
Confession showed Vach
his mental faculties are in order.

22
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:48,321
It was briefly stated
capable of executing.

23
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:55,775
To be brought to the guillotine, he shouted
the crowd held:
"Behold! A victim of the asylum!"

24
00:06:56,869 --> 00:07:02,179
Vach collapsed and no
recovered most of their senses.

25
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,267
His body was placed in
guillotine and the blade was thrown.

26
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:21,899
In Vienna, Professor. Richard von Krafft-Ebing
well-studied with great interest.

27
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:32,834
<i> ... No one monstrum by excessum </ i>, a monster
diversion, but a monstrum by defectum </ i>
monster of a disability. </ I> </ i></i>

28
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:41,796
He tried to reveal the secrets of conduct
abnormal sexual man that led to self-destruction.

29
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:44,958
Explored the physiology of the brain.

30
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:47,859
Studied the influence hereditary.

31
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,359
Together clinical and historical documents.

32
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:57,056
He sought personal interviews and
letters and diaries of the patients.

33
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:04,677
In 1886, Krafft-Ebing published
the catalog of its findings.

34
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:10,210
And coined the name "moral cancer."

35
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:15,675
Section I
MANIFESTATIONS

36
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,830
J. H. had been diagnosed with
severe neurasthenia and hypochondria.

37
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:41,831
Although he confessed practice
masturbation since age 14,
had some associations with women ...

38
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:46,331
and lived under the care of his mother anxious.

39
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:50,522
She was a woman and caste
high moral character.

40
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:02,392
He began to lose hope
unknown until this pleasure
The mother of the maid had an accident.

41
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:34,201
Awakened a thirst.

42
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:04,544
The woman is, biologically and philosophically,
a passive recipient of care
and the affection of men.

43
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:13,370
Occupies a position of great honor,
This can be for her, a source
of great pride and vanity.

44
00:12:15,261 --> 00:12:23,751
But as an object of desire of man,
often receive their
more lascivious thoughts and actions.

45
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:51,933
Fertile ground for trafficking,
diseases, sexual and moral corruption paraesthesia ...

46
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:59,933
brothels can be found
in all cities, the most
a more civilized barbarism.

47
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:25,943
Within these well-equipped cradle antros
of addiction, men are encouraged to leave ...

48
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,943
The ideal healthy sex change
recreation, it is almost
the inevitable sexual psychopaths.

49
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:39,163
The sadistic impulse to women and wounded
forced to the disrespect and humiliation ...

50
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:46,163
He also expressed the desire
defiling things
repellents or less dirty.

51
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,247
Men, on
large sums of money ...

52
00:13:50,410 --> 00:14:00,247
<i> refer to prostitutes ut viri Ilie
ora et in earum spuerent FAEC
in the urine and sometimes explerent </ i> </ i>.</i>

53
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:59,653
At the opposite end of the scale are
are dominated by the idea ...

54
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:06,653
submit a complete and unconditional
the will of another person.

55
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:14,001
As the author Leopold von Sacher-Masoch
often this perversion
the substratum of his writings ...

56
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,001
<i>Krafft-Ebing  called this anomaly
masochism sexual </ i> </ i>.</i>

57
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:25,215
Like nearly all other perversions
the sexual instinct, masochism
only takes place in ...

58
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:32,215
on the basis of an individual
psychopathic, and in large part,
genetically damaged.

59
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:39,499
Their sexual behavior often
degenerates to the madness when
submission to the games ...

60
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:46,499
and to be silly
ridiculous, so the costs of all
Masculinity and personal dignity.

61
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:54,052
Is reduced to the role and castrated
subordinated to the powerless, the weak ...

62
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:57,432
the role of women.

63
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,109
You should already be naked and ready.
There can be no mistakes today.

64
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:07,519
What is this?

65
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:10,931
This is a mechanical man.
Neither realizes that we are here.

66
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,529
Do not touch my dove vai, vai?

67
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:19,303
- I received my "pink" today.
- You should not even be here!

68
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:22,869
- I need the money.
- You know not!

69
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:27,455
If you feel the smell of
blood is not ...

70
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:32,122
Well.
I will go ahead.

71
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:34,548
Take only what I have.

72
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,649
I took the initiative,
already know the routine.

73
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:41,039
At the time of care
of the face, leave me.

74
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:45,497
If you do not disturb me,
I can play like a piano.

75
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:49,775
When you feel the smell of gum, are kept outside.

76
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:52,367
Do not look for him.
Do not say a word.

77
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:57,272
And for God's sake, do not laugh.
No matter what happens.

78
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,369
And remember.
When you hear the bell ...

79
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:06,176
Everything is ...
satisfactory?

80
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:51,555
Despite the human experience
a real physical pain and subjected to
the violent whims of another person ...

81
00:26:51,717 --> 00:26:54,555
that only pretends to be weak.

82
00:26:54,831 --> 00:27:00,801
His strength was fueled by thoughts
reassuring that, at the end of
acts purely symbolic ...

83
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,091
have the power restored the dignity they
the natural rights of man.

84
00:29:55,116 --> 00:29:58,833
I'm sure you recognize
the difficulties it faces.

85
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:04,148
Looking for someone like me, but
keep my real desire.

86
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:16,568
Stealing a few nights and I'm going to
the margin is that people like me.

87
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:19,679
No mysteries.
What kind of person?

88
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,614
A homosexual.

89
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,512
Continue.

90
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:28,740
Well, you should know that there are other gay
focus on the pier at night.

91
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:34,991
But I am not satisfied to stay with
just because a man is gay.

92
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:39,988
I was always attracted by a
very specific characteristics.

93
00:30:42,865 --> 00:30:49,418
A mustache.
Full, thick and hard.

94
00:30:51,955 --> 00:30:57,390
When I finally found my ideal
and invited him to my room, she ...

95
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:01,861
He was not what they seemed.

96
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:04,824
Make yourself at home.

97
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:15,572
You want a drink or something?

98
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:24,072
A glass of port.

99
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:46,331
Something wrong?

100
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:50,237
Nothing wrong.
Because ...

101
00:31:51,473 --> 00:31:56,076
- Sorry, I said that a port?
- A port.

102
00:32:25,973 --> 00:32:28,789
Sorry, but
seems to only have one.

103
00:32:30,452 --> 00:32:32,815
This was the mustache.

104
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:37,047
This drink.

105
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:39,140
What we're drinking?

106
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,847
Drink.

107
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,751
Prisa.

108
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,283
Prisa.

109
00:32:49,137 --> 00:32:54,599
I suppose in that moment, their feelings
this man, his virility, has been restored?

110
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:59,011
Yes, at that time I had
full possession of my manhood.

111
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:08,698
Then came here and Urania or fetish?
Fans who dislike the most?

112
00:33:10,545 --> 00:33:15,317
I came here because
understands people like me.

113
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:20,166
I think you understand
to understand better.

114
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:26,292
It is not necessarily anti-natural feed
feelings of affection towards the same sex.

115
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:31,407
But to achieve these feelings
reduces their capacity to a perversion.

116
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:34,884
Morbid psychosexual degeneration.

117
00:33:36,107 --> 00:33:40,576
- You know nothing about me.
- Really?

118
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:47,700
I bet you already tried
sexual intercourse with a woman.

119
00:33:47,878 --> 00:33:49,662
And failed.

120
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:53,825
The repugnant to masturbation, with reason.

121
00:33:54,229 --> 00:34:00,792
Therefore, another man can do the job
for you while you passively engaged.

122
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:06,852
Your feelings are of lust
in the palm of the hand of a gentleman.

123
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:11,664
This led to the complete reversal
their sexual instinct.

124
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:14,158
In fact, I know nothing about you.

125
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:26,433
What do I send?

126
00:34:28,478 --> 00:34:32,011
Section II
METHODS OF TREATMENT

127
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:06,665
I
in your treatment, doctor.

128
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:12,040
After all, is that only
patients may actually be cured.

129
00:35:13,664 --> 00:35:15,383
No?

130
00:35:16,974 --> 00:35:22,132
Wetterstrand, Bernheim, and Müller Schrenck
reported a success ...

131
00:35:22,274 --> 00:35:28,132
to replace the instinct for homosexuals
straight through the subconscious.

132
00:35:28,348 --> 00:35:31,682
Tell me, doctor, because it has
so interested in my case?

133
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:35,122
It's because I am afraid of?

134
00:35:35,348 --> 00:35:42,998
The good doctor questioned this approach because the
Hansen tried to hypnotize famous in the patient
several occasions without success.

135
00:35:43,146 --> 00:35:45,253
It's because I do not like what causes it?

136
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:53,403
In view of the most important
social interests of the patient,
necessary to make a new attempt.

137
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,413
O have mercy on me?

138
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:59,684
Decided to use
Bernheim procedure.

139
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:19,777
1 ... 2 ... 3.

140
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:44,063
Patients of all kinds, from all levels
social, in the sanatorium to salvation
psychological demons that torment.

141
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,206
A healthy environment and stable
away from the chaos of the world.

142
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,689
Open.

143
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:56,878
Open!

144
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:06,677
This is a complete laboratory
human, each with
a natural physiological distress.

145
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:17,440
As director of one of these
institutions, it is my privilege
and also my responsibility to ...

146
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:25,440
determine the origin of psychosis and the patient
The arrangements for intensive treatment.

147
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:49,500
I hate it because masturbation
makes me weak and make me suffer.

148
00:38:54,791 --> 00:39:07,900
Have no inclination
to men, because men love
is contrary to religion, nature and law.

149
00:39:12,695 --> 00:39:23,844
I am leaning towards women,
they are adorable, desirable
and were created for men.

150
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:29,040
1 ... 2 ... 3.

151
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:17,991
It is very common for women with paranoid hysteria
in the mental hospital complaining of hallucinations in
sexual violation of divine or demonic beings.

152
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,472
Sometimes all night.

153
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:32,059
It is an essential duty of all doctors to ensure safety
and welfare of all patients under their care.

154
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:53,223
I heard a woman ask a
nurse to send a letter to her.

155
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,724
Patients have
permission to send letters.

156
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,348
I know, but she "paid"
to send the letter.

157
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:04,532
And he made to swear secrecy.

158
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:15,407
Get a letter from his pocket
because they thought that Mr. I read it.

159
00:41:27,003 --> 00:41:33,020
What nurse?
Grath?

160
00:41:33,238 --> 00:41:34,547
Thought so.

161
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:47,893
You J. H.?
I will monitor their progress.

162
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:54,250
You can go.

163
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:10,624
No one is deprived of redemption,
no patient should be considered incurable.

164
00:42:10,835 --> 00:42:18,719
In cases where patients resistant to treatment by
conventional means, it is possible to alleviate their suffering ...

165
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:26,719
and offer a new opportunity to the parties ablation
patient's brain causing his illusions.

166
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:25,360
In 15 days, the good doctor began
noted signs of improvement ...

167
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:30,360
as when the patient requested
discreetly directing a brothel.

168
00:43:30,919 --> 00:43:37,529
With the complicity of several colleagues
Xavier, Krafft-Ebing reports collected
social activities of the patient.

169
00:43:37,806 --> 00:43:40,316
The patient still
to join the youth ...

170
00:43:40,506 --> 00:43:47,016
but began to woo women, imitating the
social behavior of their brethren.

171
00:43:49,746 --> 00:43:54,526
The patient asked for permission to
practice with a young lady.

172
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:12,765
You cree?

173
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:18,604
I hate it because masturbation
makes me weak and make me suffer.

174
00:44:19,027 --> 00:44:27,117
Have no inclination
to men, because men love
is contrary to religion, nature and law.

175
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:36,079
I am leaning towards women,
they are adorable, desirable
and were created for men.

176
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:42,244
I hate the love of my own sex and
never find a man attractive.

177
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:51,141
And I have to be well again, my love
a virtuous woman, be happy and make happy.

178
00:44:51,512 --> 00:44:55,787
- Practice of masturbation in the last month?
- No.

179
00:44:56,022 --> 00:44:59,261
- If there are any polução night?
- Yes

180
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:04,919
- They were preceded by images of dreams?
- Yes

181
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:07,869
Describe these pictures, please.

182
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:13,524
Fine images from a
woman pose in a luxury ...

183
00:45:13,618 --> 00:45:16,462
Eager for my attention
and my caresses.

184
00:45:59,481 --> 00:46:02,339
And his response?

185
00:46:05,259 --> 00:46:10,425
I knew I had lost my
sexual paralysis because, as I played, I ...

186
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:13,631
1 ... 2 ... 3.

187
00:47:16,737 --> 00:47:23,943
Dr. Goudron wondered if
Treatment could resign today.

188
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:31,049
How so?
Why wait for that to happen?

189
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:40,976
Sanford, in the bed 8, has a knife
strong hidden under the mattress.

190
00:47:41,736 --> 00:47:44,826
Plans to use
stab him tomorrow.

191
00:47:48,205 --> 00:47:50,109
How do you know?

192
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:58,169
Maybe I can dispense
treatment tomorrow, then?

193
00:47:58,578 --> 00:48:02,003
After the sr. has
examining bed.

194
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,202
It is a good suggestion.

195
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:13,142
Talk about it
tomorrow, okay?

196
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,828
Of course.

197
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:30,168
Entertainment

198
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:33,574
Want to hear a story?

199
00:49:34,344 --> 00:49:37,323
So go listen to a story.

200
00:49:39,196 --> 00:49:43,449
A story
say is true.

201
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:52,352
It is an old encurvado,
encurvado a horse ...

202
00:49:54,008 --> 00:49:58,445
and a girl of no importance.

203
00:50:02,573 --> 00:50:09,352
They say it was the old gypsy.
But he was not a gypsy thing.

204
00:50:10,945 --> 00:50:13,250
As far as I know.

205
00:50:14,434 --> 00:50:16,094
So what was it?

206
00:50:17,694 --> 00:50:22,944
It was a great artist.

207
00:50:23,372 --> 00:50:28,134
Or at least that I could
was a great artist.

208
00:50:29,037 --> 00:50:36,255
With the help of his daughter
created a shadow theater.

209
00:50:36,665 --> 00:50:44,257
He traveled from town to town
presenting their pieces on the inside.

210
00:50:45,974 --> 00:50:52,557
One day he was visited
a very rich man.

211
00:50:53,100 --> 00:51:00,498
Adapting a piece of this text.
Read, no?

212
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:03,662
Sure.

213
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:11,163
You can move freely, provided that no
undermine the details of the incidents.

214
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:14,096
<i> As you wish, Herr Baron </ i> </ i> </ i>.</i>

215
00:51:15,854 --> 00:51:21,600
The work must be submitted once.
Only once.

216
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:29,176
And there is no mention of
unusual nature of this little drama.

217
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:34,269
Reliable?

218
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:37,989
<i>She does not speak , Herr Baron </ i> </ i>.</i>

219
00:51:39,319 --> 00:51:42,657
Okay.
Until Saturday.

220
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:32,983
A man of delicate physique
and peculiar, Bertrand was Sargeant
since childhood, given the silence and solitude.

221
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:44,385
The details of the health of their families are not well
known, but the onset of mental illness
between his ancestors true.

222
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:52,937
They say that as a child, had pulse
destructive not explained.

223
00:53:53,573 --> 00:53:56,159
Destroyed what was at hand.

224
00:53:56,379 --> 00:54:02,650
At 9 years, he began to feel ...
inclinations toward persons of the opposite sex.

225
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,878
At 13, the impulse to sexual
strongly attracted to it.

226
00:54:09,097 --> 00:54:12,056
He began to masturbate over.

227
00:54:12,418 --> 00:54:18,888
When masturbating, your imagination
always creates a room full of women.

228
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:23,731
I thought he played
sexual intercourse with them ...

229
00:54:24,289 --> 00:54:25,949
and then killing them.

230
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:34,135
Then, as they thought dead
and wondered how they gorge.

231
00:54:35,229 --> 00:54:41,668
Once they began to feel the pulse
practice these acts with real corpses.

232
00:54:42,136 --> 00:54:46,448
For lack of human bodies,
take possession of animals.

233
00:54:53,011 --> 00:55:01,184
He opened his abdomen, ripping his
and during the act of masturbation.

234
00:55:01,435 --> 00:55:07,686
He said that therefore,
experienced an indescribable pleasure.

235
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:22,104
In late 1846, he felt the first time
the desire to use human bodies.

236
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:25,944
The idea horrified at first.

237
00:55:38,007 --> 00:55:49,275
In 1847, accidentally entering a cemetery,
found the grave of a recently buried corpse.

238
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:04,316
Momentum, accompanied by headache and
heart palpitations, she became so powerful that ...

239
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:10,316
although there were people around him and
is likely to be discovered ...

240
00:56:10,526 --> 00:56:13,569
to dig the body.

241
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:25,380
In the absence of an appropriate
get his satisfaction by a shovel
unpacks the body.

242
00:56:28,255 --> 00:56:38,627
To unearth the corpses with their hands
insensitive, in its enthusiasm,
injuries they cause in itself.

243
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:50,835
Then cut the body
with a sword or knife,
disseminate the gills and masturbate.

244
00:56:52,065 --> 00:56:59,523
In July 1848, found accidentally
the body of a girl of 16 years.

245
00:57:00,596 --> 00:57:08,438
Thus, the first time, I felt the desire
a sexual practice with a cadaver.

246
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,965
"Covered with kisses and tighten
crazy against my chest. "

247
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:24,265
"Nothing that a woman living
can offer in comparison with the
experiencing pleasure. "

248
00:57:35,307 --> 00:57:40,427
Baron and Baroness
picked up their rooms ...

249
00:57:41,752 --> 00:57:46,833
And in due time, the baron returned.

250
00:57:49,394 --> 00:57:53,220
Everything was ...
satisfactory?

251
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,461
This is for you.

252
00:58:04,658 --> 00:58:07,529
And this ...

253
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:13,564
This is for your daughter.

254
00:58:18,935 --> 00:58:20,749
Let me explain.

255
00:58:21,904 --> 00:58:26,184
The Baroness and I have no children.

256
00:58:26,563 --> 00:58:31,122
And we worried about the prospect
being alone in our old age.

257
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:35,334
Undoubtedly prefer Baron
an heir, a son?

258
00:58:35,518 --> 00:58:39,871
Baroness prefer a daughter.

259
00:58:43,674 --> 00:58:48,844
- Sorry, that's impossible, I ...
- Before saying anything more ...

260
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:57,862
Before saying anything else,
This offer can not be underestimated.

261
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:04,731
Am I right in believing
that girl has no mother?

262
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:13,119
We understand that we can offer
a better life for her.

263
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,339
An appropriate education.

264
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:23,279
We can give you a position in life
someone like you will never reach.

265
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:31,621
And the respectable people of the city
is tired of his robbery and witchcraft.

266
00:59:32,872 --> 00:59:37,650
I am also a man of
considerable influence.

267
00:59:38,621 --> 00:59:44,014
And things can get
difficult for people ...

268
00:59:44,278 --> 00:59:46,310
Reject.

269
00:59:49,024 --> 00:59:54,337
That night, horrible
sounds were heard in the house.

270
00:59:55,024 --> 01:00:00,308
Cries of Baron.
Cries of the baroness.

271
01:00:00,528 --> 01:00:06,995
E higher than this,
the cries of the girl.

272
01:00:10,368 --> 01:00:18,741
At dawn, the man encurvado
encurvado to tow the horse float ...

273
01:00:18,868 --> 01:00:24,741
to take the bag of gold
Back to the home of the Baron.

274
01:00:26,993 --> 01:00:30,276
But came to the house.

275
01:01:43,643 --> 01:01:46,086
But what happened to the girl?

276
01:01:46,741 --> 01:01:49,491
She was still young.

277
01:01:50,576 --> 01:01:52,992
However, the lost innocence.

278
01:01:54,112 --> 01:01:57,857
And learn not to trust anyone.

279
01:01:58,628 --> 01:02:03,365
Even in man encurvado
encurvado with the horse.

280
01:02:03,978 --> 01:02:06,800
So what's the moral of the story?

281
01:02:06,991 --> 01:02:11,727
Moral?
There is no moral, dear.

282
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,677
Just a story.

283
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:25,632
Section III
Blessing and Maledictions FOR WOMEN

284
01:02:31,676 --> 01:02:40,228
Nothing more satisfying to see a patient
resume its place as a healthy member
and well-adjusted society.

285
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:45,579
I forgive one days
for having sent him away?

286
01:02:45,768 --> 01:02:51,833
Forgive?
Dear Mother, I have to thank!

287
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,852
I do not know how I can
pay what you did.

288
01:02:56,050 --> 01:03:00,015
But it is what I do,
starting tomorrow.

289
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:05,446
Endured long
responsibility of managing the home.

290
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:10,424
I take care of hiring someone to help you,
so you can have the rest it deserves.

291
01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:16,080
- Oh, Jonathan, is not necessary ...
- I do not want to be a burden to you, mother.

292
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:32,388
Jonathan's mother watched with pride
son to assume the care and control of the house.

293
01:03:33,196 --> 01:03:36,796
It's so good to see distracting.

294
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:49,328
Although there were some doubts about
the role of which is limited to convalescence.

295
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:25,983
Perhaps we should not hire a new set up yet.
I am sure that ...

296
01:04:39,438 --> 01:04:45,980
Although the woman appears to belong
psychologically more sex ...

297
01:04:46,138 --> 01:04:52,980
a certain stage of their lives, it becomes vulnerable
a weakening of his mental strength.

298
01:04:53,909 --> 01:05:01,934
Alone with his thoughts, his mother
J. H. began to suffer from mild paranoia.

299
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:12,655
And some began to develop hallucinations
in the rehabilitation of their child.

300
01:05:15,823 --> 01:05:21,450
For the woman who comes to
deteriorating mental state ...

301
01:05:21,623 --> 01:05:27,450
beauty and youth are cruel reminders
the decline of their physical charms.

302
01:05:27,665 --> 01:05:33,909
Often, the patient uses to carry out
free to retrieve the man's attention.

303
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:20,541
Without treatment, the illusion becomes
more intense, more erratic ...

304
01:06:20,658 --> 01:06:25,541
sex until the paranoid moves
by irrational thoughts ...

305
01:06:25,687 --> 01:06:34,880
to commit irrational acts, which leads to a
condition of increasing despair and confusion.

306
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:48,598
<i> affected by the madness of natural menopause,
melancholy atmosphere </ i>, sex dreams ...</ i></i>

307
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:53,598
delusions of persecution and physical acute paranoia.

308
01:07:14,784 --> 01:07:16,847
He ...

309
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:18,993
He ..?

310
01:07:26,191 --> 01:07:27,879
What, Mom?

311
01:07:28,507 --> 01:07:34,558
Jonathan, please tell me the truth.
What are these girls?

312
01:07:34,752 --> 01:07:36,339
What do you mean?

313
01:07:36,475 --> 01:07:40,992
They said I was cured,
more than that sort of thing.

314
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:46,815
- But, Mom ...
- You are not a vampire, a boy is healthy!

315
01:07:49,324 --> 01:07:53,168
If you need blood,
find a way.

316
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:59,354
However, the dirty created ...

317
01:07:59,573 --> 01:08:02,581
- You okay, Mom?
- Tell me, son.

318
01:08:03,101 --> 01:08:06,548
- The doctor advised me that this could happen.
- Doctor?

319
01:08:06,727 --> 01:08:11,693
You have acted in a very peculiar.
I took the liberty to seek Dr. Goudron.

320
01:08:11,831 --> 01:08:18,829
He thinks that may be related to your menopause.
Well, Mom, I learned all about these issues.

321
01:08:18,989 --> 01:08:23,412
Your body will
some changes for now.

322
01:08:23,539 --> 01:08:26,129
A transformation of your entire being.

323
01:08:26,568 --> 01:08:31,391
This can cause a form of
hysteria, which requires medical attention.

324
01:08:33,614 --> 01:08:38,360
I learned a lot
while I was hospitalized ...

325
01:08:43,267 --> 01:08:45,265
Show me your hands.

326
01:08:45,414 --> 01:08:46,859
Is the blood, I ...

327
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:56,096
The patient considered hostile to the surrounding
and comes with an aggressive attitude.

328
01:08:59,952 --> 01:09:01,567
And you ...

329
01:09:02,393 --> 01:09:06,664
Show me your hands!
Show!

330
01:09:16,607 --> 01:09:19,598
I do not understand
trying to help them?

331
01:09:19,779 --> 01:09:25,923
He won the love and not call you!
He only wants your blood!

332
01:09:30,108 --> 01:09:39,357
At the peak of the disease, treatment
is essential to remove the patient
external factors that aggravate their condition.

333
01:09:39,548 --> 01:09:44,735
And eliminating a place where
possible maximum tranquility.

334
01:09:45,037 --> 01:09:49,903
Be careful to have the best
treatment available, mom.
Dr. Goudron is an extraordinary man.

335
01:09:50,014 --> 01:09:52,480
Maybe I can visit it.

336
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:57,542
I know you blood.

337
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:42,972
Attracting men to women is the result
a complex process of objetificação.

338
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:51,093
He is bewitched by the shape of your body,
the color of her hair is blond or brown.

339
01:10:51,316 --> 01:11:00,696
Either the shape or color of your eyes,
his voice, the smell of your hair or body.

340
01:11:00,968 --> 01:11:09,199
<i>These physical attributes have 
various reactions in man sensual
and form what we call physiological fetishism </ i> </ i> </ i>.</i>

341
01:11:11,196 --> 01:11:19,477
The woman is thus a group
mobile object fetish
to which men are encouraged to respond.

342
01:11:22,156 --> 01:11:26,876
But the nature of female desire
much more difficult to understand.

343
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:30,073
The woman is passive.

344
01:11:30,189 --> 01:11:38,073
Since it is physically and mentally normal,
well-born and educated properly,
with little sexual desires.

345
01:11:40,189 --> 01:11:44,938
Their ambitions are high
marriage and motherhood.

346
01:11:46,854 --> 01:11:52,568
The birth of a child is
achieving the purpose of his life.

347
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:15,853
And no more noble sacrifice
that of a woman who gives her life
the birth of a child.

348
01:12:27,286 --> 01:12:36,932
An owner was very provincial
concerned by the disinterest of his daughter
by love and marriage.

349
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:46,867
To instruct them as to appropriate ways
For a woman, hired a tutor
that would guide his natural destiny.

350
01:12:47,133 --> 01:12:51,601
A woman, on a rare occasion,
was also my patient.

351
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:57,819
Thank you for your donation of magazines.
I think the most enlightening.

352
01:12:58,784 --> 01:13:08,060
If I may be frank,
I can not help but wonder if
which are completely honest in their journals.

353
01:13:08,815 --> 01:13:12,306
As always felt
only the love of women ...

354
01:13:13,711 --> 01:13:17,270
physically, but never acted
in response to this momentum.

355
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:25,032
The closest that came with
the elderly woman. Married women.

356
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:27,990
When the age of 17?

357
01:13:28,179 --> 01:13:30,099
How do I know?

358
01:13:30,721 --> 01:13:34,929
I was at home
during my education.

359
01:13:35,428 --> 01:13:41,501
Although he was totally devoted to her,
can be characterized as one of their feelings ...

360
01:13:44,648 --> 01:13:51,500
"Awareness undefined
mystique of impropriety. "

361
01:13:53,397 --> 01:13:55,598
What does this mean?

362
01:13:56,307 --> 01:14:00,616
This means you never
touch, or touch.

363
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:05,687
And I never told him how I felt ...

364
01:14:09,156 --> 01:14:11,956
Because these feelings are immoral.

365
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:20,553
She did not want to pollute my innocence
I did not want to pollute their marriage.

366
01:14:21,594 --> 01:14:24,337
So if you wanted to for months?

367
01:14:24,499 --> 01:14:26,280
Years.

368
01:14:27,972 --> 01:14:30,814
Without this love?

369
01:14:34,315 --> 01:14:36,311
Never married?

370
01:14:38,498 --> 01:14:40,828
I thought about it.

371
01:14:41,188 --> 01:14:44,313
For some time he wanted a family.

372
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,492
Since normality could be a cure.

373
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:54,339
But basically, I knew
that life would be a lie.

374
01:14:55,446 --> 01:15:00,678
It would be unfair to a man
my body, but to deny my heart.

375
01:15:03,742 --> 01:15:05,602
E. ..

376
01:15:12,192 --> 01:15:19,070
No traveling
my illness to a child.

377
01:15:19,601 --> 01:15:24,191
So you really want
a child?

378
01:15:27,309 --> 01:15:29,441
More than anything else.

379
01:15:31,101 --> 01:15:36,817
But prefers not to have a child
risk that is ...

380
01:15:36,974 --> 01:15:39,258
... Sexually invested?

381
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:46,663
Therefore, to live alone?

382
01:15:49,255 --> 01:15:52,000
What are my options?

383
01:16:14,299 --> 01:16:20,900
And the passion is so pure that floods
As the modesty of those that do not require anything.

384
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:27,708
I love you with the sting of the old feathers

385
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:34,541
With smiles, with tears of prayer
And the faith of my childhood, innocent and strong.

386
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:40,341
I love you even more
small, for life.

387
01:16:40,657 --> 01:16:45,138
And so God has willed
I love you even more after death.

388
01:16:48,427 --> 01:16:50,313
Very good!

389
01:17:04,097 --> 01:17:07,087
Now it's your turn to
fulfill its part of the agreement.

390
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:10,936
Since this agreement was even foolish?

391
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:18,269
Ten questions on any topic,
answered honestly.

392
01:17:19,617 --> 01:17:23,561
Okay.
Question 1?

393
01:17:24,815 --> 01:17:26,991
Do you like my father?

394
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:32,127
I have nothing but the highest
respect for his father.

395
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:35,367
Nothing else?

396
01:17:35,614 --> 01:17:37,623
Nothing more.

397
01:17:39,148 --> 01:17:41,377
Would you like me?

398
01:17:41,622 --> 01:17:43,895
I love you!

399
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:48,219
Do you love me?

400
01:17:48,562 --> 01:17:51,813
As if it were my own daughter.

401
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:54,821
Why do you never married?

402
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:58,478
Never met a man who loved
enough for me to marry him.

403
01:17:58,608 --> 01:18:01,300
Or never found me.

404
01:18:02,726 --> 01:18:06,474
- Have you met a man?
- Of course ...

405
01:18:08,953 --> 01:18:11,037
Have to answer!

406
01:18:11,175 --> 01:18:13,567
- I?
- You swore!

407
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:22,423
No.
Never.

408
01:18:23,764 --> 01:18:29,454
Sorry.
I did not want to bother.

409
01:18:35,172 --> 01:18:38,299
You know ...

410
01:18:39,078 --> 01:18:41,545
... A woman?

411
01:18:43,579 --> 01:18:46,513
Stop already with this nonsense criancice.

412
01:18:46,669 --> 01:18:49,919
I am sure that his father
love to hear your curiosity
on these issues.

413
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:54,454
Sorry. Do not say anything,
please, sorry.
Please.

414
01:18:55,327 --> 01:19:03,608
I know they are young and curious
and having heard terrible things
those of their cousins.

415
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,484
Was that?

416
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:15,013
But we must understand that
certain issues should not be done.

417
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,515
It was absolutely clear?

418
01:19:32,058 --> 01:19:38,470
Despite the warning, the feeling mutual
Lydia continued to deepen and Annabel.

419
01:19:39,562 --> 01:19:44,166
They were delivered in secret ...

420
01:19:45,011 --> 01:19:48,875
days spent in the woods alone ...

421
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:52,357
and whispered conversations ...

422
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:55,419
which contrasts with the cases permitted.

423
01:19:55,751 --> 01:20:00,576
You did not answer the sixth question.
So I still have to do 5.

424
01:20:01,478 --> 01:20:04,231
- Really?
- Yes, yes.

425
01:20:07,128 --> 01:20:11,105
Okay.
Continue.

426
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:13,958
Carefully girl.

427
01:20:18,984 --> 01:20:30,644
When you were younger, were
any woman who
they share a special love?

428
01:20:34,675 --> 01:20:36,505
Yes

429
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:46,815
You came to share
her feelings with her?

430
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:48,859
No.

431
01:20:52,798 --> 01:20:59,299
It is better for both of us
who have never spoken.

432
01:21:00,661 --> 01:21:05,047
To understand how this
issue is serious, right?

433
01:21:10,536 --> 01:21:12,764
Okay.

434
01:22:05,908 --> 01:22:10,199
Not now, Annabel.
Go to your room.

435
01:22:12,073 --> 01:22:14,200
Honey, you can not Simp ...

436
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:28,010
I ask only once and
respond honestly and directly, I was clear?

437
01:22:29,354 --> 01:22:31,228
Yes, sir.

438
01:22:32,384 --> 01:22:35,634
These individuals serve as witnesses.

439
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:48,701
You damaged my
daughter in any way?

440
01:22:51,877 --> 01:22:58,575
- I have not touched inappropriately, Mr.
- Responding to my question.

441
01:22:58,929 --> 01:23:04,136
- I shall not affect in any way.
- Responding to my question.

442
01:23:05,948 --> 01:23:10,665
<i> - Please, listen and understand.
- What is the problem? </ I> </ i></i>

443
01:23:12,073 --> 01:23:13,822
Dad?

444
01:23:14,132 --> 01:23:16,248
Refuses to respond?

445
01:23:16,376 --> 01:23:18,539
<i>Reply  what? </ I> </ i></i>

446
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:23,194
- Okay, Annabel give answers.
- Please Pere Lindstrom, if they give me a moment ...

447
01:23:23,258 --> 01:23:24,853
Lie, Annabel.

448
01:23:25,009 --> 01:23:27,167
- Please, no.
- Lie.

449
01:23:27,323 --> 01:23:31,563
- Lydia, who ...
- Do not ask for it, as I said it!

450
01:23:43,657 --> 01:23:47,057
Dare not touch it.

451
01:23:52,259 --> 01:23:57,604
Please Pere Lindstrom,
everything you want to know.

452
01:23:57,771 --> 01:23:59,843
It is not fair ...

453
01:24:11,498 --> 01:24:14,474
Remains intact.

454
01:24:33,139 --> 01:24:37,707
Annabel, what are you doing here?
Must be with the guests.

455
01:24:37,932 --> 01:24:40,323
Why not in my party?

456
01:24:40,817 --> 01:24:42,796
I do not feel well.

457
01:24:42,949 --> 01:24:47,763
- Sorry to disappoint her, but her father said ...
- My father?

458
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:49,665
What about me?

459
01:24:50,076 --> 01:24:53,576
You're the only person in the world
is important to me.

460
01:24:53,702 --> 01:24:56,821
- Think you do not know that?
- Annabel ...

461
01:24:58,064 --> 01:25:02,034
Believe me, I know
what is best for us.

462
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:05,697
Things are beyond our control.

463
01:25:08,852 --> 01:25:13,357
I received an offer of
work elsewhere.

464
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:16,003
I will accept.

465
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:18,136
How so?

466
01:25:18,229 --> 01:25:20,190
- I will starting tomorrow.
- No.

467
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:23,696
- Yes
- No, you can not.

468
01:25:23,977 --> 01:25:26,937
Do not do this, please, I love you!

469
01:25:27,248 --> 01:25:28,530
You do not know what you're saying!

470
01:25:28,605 --> 01:25:31,008
I love you, why do not you love me too?

471
01:25:33,601 --> 01:25:37,570
- Please!
- Annabel ...

472
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:50,007
What I feel about you is no secret.

473
01:25:54,412 --> 01:25:58,384
Why should we talk about it?

474
01:25:59,569 --> 01:26:02,917
Why we must act
in response to that?

475
01:26:03,574 --> 01:26:07,039
Thus.

476
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:10,884
Leave it as is.

477
01:26:16,683 --> 01:26:18,849
And that is not weak.

478
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:23,156
There and back to get his guests.

479
01:26:26,692 --> 01:26:28,745
Smile.

480
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:31,464
Try to be strong.

481
01:26:59,879 --> 01:27:03,256
I am stronger than you think, Lydia.

482
01:27:04,379 --> 01:27:09,596
I can do things you never could.

483
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:19,037
I do not want to die alone and unhappy as you.

484
01:27:19,253 --> 01:27:21,284
Annabel.

485
01:27:21,846 --> 01:27:23,972
Question No. 8.

486
01:27:24,147 --> 01:27:28,127
To prove that I am strong?

487
01:27:30,971 --> 01:27:32,931
Yes

488
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:01,617
Annabel, how could ...

489
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:06,411
I am stronger than you.

490
01:28:07,129 --> 01:28:11,408
Then do something
to love me.

491
01:28:12,241 --> 01:28:15,816
- Question No. 9.
- Annabel, please stop.

492
01:28:16,878 --> 01:28:19,785
Do you love me?

493
01:28:19,978 --> 01:28:23,285
Of course, I love you.

494
01:28:24,492 --> 01:28:27,628
I love you.

495
01:28:57,248 --> 01:28:59,774
Take me.

496
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:29,700
Please.

497
01:30:15,627 --> 01:30:27,045
It is a sad privilege of medicine,
and especially in psychiatry, evidence
the weaknesses of human nature.

498
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:39,000
However, the doctor finds comfort
the fact that the attribution of these aberrations
conditions of physical or mental illness ...

499
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:42,827
can save
the honor of humanity ...

500
01:30:43,043 --> 01:30:46,108
on behalf of morality.

501
01:30:47,981 --> 01:30:51,877
EPILOGUE

502
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,542
Xavier?

503
01:30:57,731 --> 01:30:59,604
It is you!

504
01:31:00,093 --> 01:31:03,889
- How are you, my good boy?
- Actually, I am with my wife.

505
01:31:04,045 --> 01:31:08,670
Listen, do not know
my treatment, I was alone
hospitalized for a short period.

506
01:31:08,822 --> 01:31:11,389
Do not mention it much ...

507
01:31:15,916 --> 01:31:19,906
Dr. Goudron I attended during
my treatment at the sanatorium.

508
01:31:20,044 --> 01:31:22,384
I was only an observer.

509
01:31:22,575 --> 01:31:25,415
My specialty is
neuropathology.

510
01:31:25,635 --> 01:31:28,306
Oh, a specialist.

511
01:31:28,481 --> 01:31:30,686
I think that board.

512
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:47,855
I did not know the status of Xavier
was so extraordinary to attract
the attention of a specialist.

513
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,945
I was not the only
Xavier is very young ...

514
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:54,310
Honey can be an angel and ask
has a vacancy in the wagon to comment?

515
01:31:54,436 --> 01:31:56,467
But I wanted to stay and
talk to the doctor!

516
01:31:56,604 --> 01:31:59,312
Be nice, okay?

517
01:32:29,635 --> 01:32:32,039
Mr. and knew the doctor?

518
01:32:32,397 --> 01:32:35,600
Yes, very well.

519
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:43,186
You know, in your opinion
practically a child.

520
01:32:43,911 --> 01:32:46,260
It was an honor to have been his patient.

521
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:51,819
No, he progressed to 50 years in medicine,
but I think that while he lived, never
understand the impact of their work.

522
01:32:52,026 --> 01:32:58,124
Maybe I am naive, but ...
He cataloged and studied sexual deviations.

523
01:33:00,035 --> 01:33:03,529
On the surface, perhaps, but
was much more than that.

524
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:09,821
He brought the shadow more mysteries
life in science.

525
01:33:09,974 --> 01:33:16,466
People do not see the stars more
to understand this kind of behavior.

526
01:33:17,067 --> 01:33:21,008
Neither judges and clerics,
but we will.

527
01:33:21,149 --> 01:33:26,425
And judges and clerics who were
for answers and knowledge.

528
01:33:28,431 --> 01:33:30,909
In due time ...

529
01:33:31,507 --> 01:33:37,401
all facets of human existence is
governed by a medical specialist.

530
01:33:37,496 --> 01:33:41,650
Every child born in a hospital,
The whole world will die under the care of a physician ...

531
01:33:41,774 --> 01:33:47,691
Every marriage is subject to approval
to ensure a medically appropriate.

532
01:33:48,221 --> 01:33:49,804
It will not take.

533
01:33:50,052 --> 01:33:53,283
So is its founder
religion, right?

534
01:33:53,868 --> 01:33:56,367
If you prefer this ...

535
01:33:57,189 --> 01:34:03,223
A religion of knowledge of good and evil.

536
01:34:09,973 --> 01:34:12,339
What do you think?

537
01:34:20,118 --> 01:34:23,005
I hate masturbation.

538
01:34:24,745 --> 01:34:29,005
Because he makes me weak and make me suffer.

539
01:34:31,187 --> 01:34:36,910
Have no inclination toward men.

540
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:43,156
The love of men is not
religion, nature and law.

541
01:34:45,534 --> 01:34:50,035
I am leaning towards women.

542
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:55,315
Because they are adorable and desirable
were created for men.

543
01:34:56,311 --> 01:34:59,190
Very good.
