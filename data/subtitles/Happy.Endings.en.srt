1
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,973
Wait!

2
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,091
Wait!

3
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:48,034
My God! Oh, my God!

4
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:49,415
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,009
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

6
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,418
- I didn't see her! I didn't see her!
- Oh, my God!

7
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:55,237
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
I didn't see her!

8
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,509
Do you have a cell?! Call 911!

9
00:00:57,577 --> 00:00:58,821
Oh, God!

10
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:05,636
Hey, is she all right?

11
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:06,884
I don't know!

12
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:09,986
911? Yes, hurry,
we need an ambulance quick.

13
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,317
My tapes.

14
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:17,436
Sorry.

15
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:30,943
This is cool, isn't it?

16
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:44,223
I, uh...I ran with scissors.

17
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,452
Seriously. I was six.

18
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:59,200
We're not related, you know.

19
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,672
Not really.

20
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:05,661
Pregnant? Pregnant?!

21
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:11,264
Get your bony fucking ass
out of this car!

22
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,336
What the hell
is the matter with you?!

23
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,613
What the fuck were you...

24
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:24,822
I gotta go.

25
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:26,718
Wait...

26
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,947
Wear this when they do it.

27
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:32,437
It's--it's good luck.

28
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,821
Mamie? Who's in there?

29
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:35,743
No one, Mom. I'm on the phone.

30
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,629
Charles is waiting in the car,
so hurry up.

31
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,866
OK, I'm coming.

32
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,421
I've got your blue bag.

33
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:50,589
I only did it
to get out of this house. OK?

34
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:52,029
No, you didn't.

35
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:55,673
Mamie! It's time to go!

36
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:18,459
- Hello.
- Hello.

37
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,044
I'm Mamie Toll. I have an 11:00.

38
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:24,979
A one-hour is 75, right?

39
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:26,841
That's right.

40
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:28,915
I'm gonna tip her now...

41
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,355
so if you would please
just tell her beforehand.

42
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,665
What's her name?

43
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:36,179
I'm sorry,
I have you down for Javier.

44
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,039
Do you prefer a woman?

45
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:40,147
No, it's fine.

46
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:44,180
That's fine. Can you make a note,
though, for next time?

47
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:46,351
Thank you.

48
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:05,587
OK, I'm ready.

49
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:13,010
Hello. I'm Javier.

50
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,021
Hi, I'm Mamie.

51
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:18,934
Have you had massages often?

52
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:22,677
Not really.
I've had them before, but...

53
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:24,981
What place hurts you?

54
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:27,634
My lower back, a little.
Right there.

55
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:29,231
OK.

56
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:31,126
OK, turn over.

57
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:33,874
I'll lift the top sheet for you.

58
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:34,958
What?

59
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:37,813
Better if we finish with the back.

60
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,953
Oh. Of course, yeah.

61
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:43,471
Makes sense. OK.

62
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,583
OK. Yeah.

63
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,652
Put your hands
at your side, please.

64
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:50,927
Relax them.

65
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:52,045
Oh, sorry, yeah.

66
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,019
Everyone does it
different--differently.

67
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:56,850
I'm Javier.
Did I say that already?

68
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,128
Or Javi?

69
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:00,782
Yes, Javier. Yeah, you said it.

70
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,690
- OK?
- Yeah.

71
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,282
OK, lifting your leg.

72
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,829
Just let it be loose, OK?

73
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,389
This is for your lower back,
to stretch.

74
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,672
Uh-huh.

75
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,748
Bend your knee.

76
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:23,953
Good. Good.
And I push, OK?

77
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,263
Uh-huh.

78
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,270
OK.

79
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,089
Do not bring your shoulders up.
Let them fall down.

80
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:34,504
- OK.
- Let them fall down.

81
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:36,751
Let them go.

82
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,867
Yeah.

83
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,630
OK.

84
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,487
Let 'em go.

85
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:43,212
What are you doing?

86
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,323
They can hear us.

87
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:48,209
Wh-what are you...

88
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,762
Get--OK, get off me.
Are you crazy?

89
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:51,884
- Shh!
- Don't!

90
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:55,402
This is what you need.
This is why you've paid.

91
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:57,841
Well, it was--
it was a gift certificate.

92
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:00,880
Oh, shit!

93
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,861
A gift certificate?
You would say that?

94
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,798
I just wanted to be specific.
You know, a lot of details.

95
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:11,815
I told you I couldn't
pull this off, I can't--

96
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,296
You're not a good liar.

97
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:15,433
- No.
- This is good.

98
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,359
Well, you're not so hot, OK?

99
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:19,279
With the, you know,
"This is what you need."

100
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:20,489
That was a little much.

101
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:22,316
You know what I was going to say?
I was going to say...

102
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:25,449
"Trust my hands,
trust my fingers."

103
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:29,767
I don't want to get you fired.

104
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:33,637
I agree. 100 percentage.

105
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:35,753
They can hear.

106
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:40,677
Muu...

107
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,856
Mucous. Mucous.

108
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,300
- Mu-cous.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:48,141
Muc-cous.
Muc--Ah. Muc-ous.

110
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:50,727
Mem-bran-ee?

111
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,074
- Membranes.
- Mem-bran-ees?

112
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:54,030
- Membranes.
- Mem-bran-ees sound better, no?

113
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,045
But it--

114
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:09,452
it already has a face, right?

115
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:11,406
A face and a personality?

116
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,244
It has more of a head
than a face at this stage.

117
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:18,210
And a personality?
I don't--Not a personality.

118
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,673
I don't think you could say that.

119
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:22,722
No one's giving me any advice.

120
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:26,244
I'm not here for advice.
I'm here to listen.

121
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:28,487
I can't tell you what to do.

122
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:31,402
That's great. That's helpful.

123
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,322
I had one when I was your age.

124
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:45,642
And were you sorry after?

125
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:48,425
I mean, does it bother you?

126
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:49,768
I'm Catholic.

127
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:51,688
I shouldn't have told you that.

128
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:53,826
And I'm Jewish, so...

129
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,938
I shouldn't have
told you that, either.

130
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,176
Will you be here tomorrow?

131
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,005
It's tomorrow at 10:00 if I decide.

132
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:07,204
Tomorrow? No. No,
but there will be someone for you...

133
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:10,503
Janet, if you want
to talk afterwards.

134
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,368
Yeah. I'm gonna do it.

135
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:17,670
OK.

136
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:19,429
I'm not maternal, either.

137
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,199
Thank you.

138
00:09:47,943 --> 00:09:51,074
It's 7:00.
I guess you're on your way.

139
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:53,117
It's tonight, you know,
in case you're checking.

140
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:54,270
- Fuck!
- Call me.

141
00:09:54,342 --> 00:09:55,685
Fuck!

142
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:59,907
Hi. Yeah, Charley Peppitone, please.
It's his sister.

143
00:10:02,758 --> 00:10:04,579
Hey, it's me.

144
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,474
Hi. Listen,
I'm--I'm too tired to come over.

145
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:11,744
Well, Charley, he's two!

146
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:15,196
And--No, he's not gonna--
He doesn't even know me.

147
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:18,716
I didn't get a present,
and Pam and Diane don't care.

148
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:21,822
- They don't even like me.
- They do like you.

149
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:25,917
Come on--What?
You don't have to worry about that.

150
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:28,802
No--Listen--No, Gil has, like,
a bunch of presents...

151
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:31,552
and he can just,
like, put your name on one...

152
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:34,403
and then it'll be great,
you know?

153
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:38,724
OK, wait, wait, wait.
Mamie? Hello?

154
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,193
Shit.

155
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:03,547
Yeah!

156
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:05,340
- Happy birth--

157
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:06,784
That makes him cry.

158
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:09,532
Yeah, but the cake is great,
and the candles--love that.

159
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,293
Can he blow 'em out?

160
00:11:11,362 --> 00:11:12,408
Yeah, you wanna
blow 'em out, baby?

161
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:13,660
We'll do it.

162
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:16,064
- Everybody do it together.
- Blow towards Mommy.

163
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,252
One, two, three, blow!

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,367
I hated that song, too.
I never knew where to look.

165
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:27,742
And how long
can you stare at candles?

166
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:31,801
Just cake, no icing,
'cause we don't do sugar for him.

167
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:34,261
I thought the whole point
of being a kid was candy.

168
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:37,053
Not anymore.

169
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,672
Could we just have dogs?

170
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:41,684
Oh, come on.
You would have been a great dad.

171
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,253
Aw, thanks.

172
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,782
We tried. It wasn't meant to be.

173
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:49,400
- Besides, being an uncle's better.
- Yeah.

174
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,780
So strong!

175
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:00,661
There you go.

176
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:21,339
Your cousin bites.

177
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:24,570
She doesn't. She's really good.

178
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:26,809
You think she bites?

179
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,982
Her husband's cute.

180
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,301
He totally is staring at your tits.

181
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:36,306
That's why I've got two weeks
to find somewhere else to stay.

182
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:40,663
Well, I wish you hadn't
slept with Rick back then...

183
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:42,161
otherwise, you know...

184
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:44,122
I know. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Sorry, sorry.

185
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:45,135
It's OK.

186
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:47,631
I'm gonna find somewhere.
It's cool. It's taken care of.

187
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,926
OK!

188
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:01,075
OK, next up, we have Jude!

189
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,088
Jude?

190
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:04,373
Jude? What did you do?

191
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:06,896
- Jude here?
- It's funny, 'cause she's right here.

192
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:08,855
You are such a jackass!

193
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:13,933
- That was great.
- Thanks.

194
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,789
OK...

195
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,686
Are you fucking serious?

196
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,801
That isn't what you picked?

197
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:26,004
No, no, that's what I picked.

198
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,193
OK.

199
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,927
This song is for someone
who's here tonight.

200
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:45,589
If you search for tenderness

201
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:48,915
It isn't hard to find

202
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:53,292
You can have the love
you need to live...

203
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,472
Little low.

204
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,357
If you look for truthfulness

205
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:02,350
You might just as well be blind

206
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:08,913
It always seems to be
so hard to give

207
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,429
Honesty

208
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:15,764
It's such a lonely word

209
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:21,612
Everyone is so untrue

210
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,129
Honesty

211
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:29,425
Is hardly ever heard

212
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:35,602
It's mostly what I need from you

213
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:43,463
I can find a lover

214
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:46,670
I can find a friend

215
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,547
I can have security
until the bitter end

216
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,400
Anyone can comfort me
with promises again

217
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:01,296
I know

218
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:08,939
I know

219
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,506
- Hey, Jude?
- Oh, fuck off.

220
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:25,098
What? Oh, it's not that.

221
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,763
I've got this band. Serpentine?

222
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,515
Oh, have you ever heard of us?

223
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,598
No.

224
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:37,704
Anyway, Rain, our singer...

225
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:40,262
she got sent to rehab.

226
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:41,796
So I was thinking...

227
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,728
Hey, Otis! What's up?

228
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,732
Oh, can I borrow this?

229
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:52,228
We watched it last week, right?

230
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:55,466
Yeah, but I want to listen
to the commentary.

231
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,541
You want to?

232
00:15:57,613 --> 00:16:00,582
Uh, I gotta get home.

233
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:03,655
Yeah, I saw your...Gil.

234
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:08,644
- Hey, the baby's cute.
- Yeah.

235
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:13,416
Who would you say
he looked like?

236
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:17,739
Shit, I don't know.
What's the name of the pretty one?

237
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:19,748
Diane. No, no, no.
A guy, you know?

238
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:21,610
You know, if you had to say
a guy he looked like.

239
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:23,171
I didn't really see him.

240
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:26,310
He's a baby,
you know, cute, you know.

241
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,098
That's all I meant.
Like, puppies and shit.

242
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,479
- I'll see you Thursday.
- Yeah, sure.

243
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:39,108
Serpentine's playing?

244
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,481
OK. See ya.

245
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,140
Otis? Is that you?

246
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:38,678
Did you leave this at my house?

247
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,636
"Does 5/13/85
mean anything to you?

248
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:46,297
"If so, meet me at
Cahuenga Grounds at 11:00."

249
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:49,083
It's a little dramatic.
I'm sorry. I'm Nicky.

250
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,361
What is this about?

251
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,166
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression.

252
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,401
I'm not a bad guy.

253
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,097
I'm a documentary filmmaker.

254
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:03,835
And I have a proposal for you.
Strictly legitimate.

255
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:09,881
What do you know about this date?

256
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,844
You had a kid on that day.
Somewhere in Phoenix.

257
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:16,186
Tell me I have that wrong.

258
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,603
Do you want a coffee or anything?
A scone or...

259
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,133
I don't--I don't have any children.

260
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:23,799
Well, not legally, yeah.

261
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,136
But, I mean, you know,
he's still yours.

262
00:20:26,204 --> 00:20:28,025
See--Hey, see?
I know it's a boy.

263
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:30,067
I know everything about him.

264
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,474
I know his name,
I know where he lives.

265
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,745
He wrote, when he turned 18,
about a year ago...

266
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:36,853
for all that information
that they have to give you.

267
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:39,128
That's how I got your name.

268
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,658
He wants to contact me?

269
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:44,436
Well...no.

270
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:48,698
But they sent him back this file,
which he showed me...

271
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:51,218
and I have in a very safe place.

272
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,885
But he didn't want
to go through with it...

273
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:55,223
'cause he's such a suck-up
to his fake parents.

274
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,390
I hate to tell you,
he's really kind of a pussy.

275
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,889
Who are you?

276
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:04,664
I'm a friend.
I'm like a mentor...guy.

277
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:08,471
He went to my high school
six years after me.

278
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:10,774
Do you want to find him?
Because I can tell you how...

279
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:13,013
on one condition...

280
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:15,951
which is...

281
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,872
you let me film the whole thing--
you finding your kid.

282
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:20,497
See, I need to get into AFI.

283
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,990
Do you know AFI?
AFI is American Film Institute.

284
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:24,407
So, they have scholarships.

285
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:26,960
Well, they have, like,
one scholarship a year...

286
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:28,920
so I need a killer film.

287
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:32,629
A documentary,
like you finding your kid.

288
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:33,907
I don't believe this.

289
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:35,122
OK, yeah.
We'd have to fake parts of it.

290
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,769
Sure, we would.
But the emotion would be true.

291
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,596
Your guilt and stuff...

292
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:43,249
that would be our selling point.

293
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,548
I am so glad
that you're not a dog.

294
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:49,365
I mean, you know,
even if the story is great...

295
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:51,156
people want to look at
good-looking people.

296
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:52,598
You know,
all things being equal.

297
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:54,736
So, huge relief
when I saw you, you know?

298
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:58,190
And I can make you look better.
That's lighting.

299
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:01,709
I don't need to see my son.

300
00:22:01,782 --> 00:22:04,303
I was going to have
an abortion, in fact...

301
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:07,409
until someone talked me out it.

302
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:10,990
If you don't care, then why'd you keep
updating the adoption agency...

303
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,340
with your addresses?

304
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:14,064
There's four of them in the file.

305
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:20,394
He has the information.
He can contact me if he wants to.

306
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:22,540
He won't. He threw it away.

307
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:24,947
The whole file.
That's how I got it.

308
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:30,122
If it wasn't for me, you'd go
to your grave without ever seeing him.

309
00:22:31,188 --> 00:22:33,425
You can keep that.
I have the original.

310
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:35,249
I needed to reshoot finding it
for the movie.

311
00:22:35,317 --> 00:22:36,559
There's other stuff, too.

312
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:38,537
There's other stuff like this
that I can--

313
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:41,874
Anyway, just...say yes.

314
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,828
I mean, it's win-win here.

315
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,849
This is a human being
you're talking about.

316
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:50,990
Yeah! Who you gave away, OK?

317
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,580
I mean, come on,
don't--don't be like that.

318
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:57,099
Look, I know that this is
one of those big ideas...

319
00:22:57,171 --> 00:23:00,268
but it's really just better
if you just say yes to the movie...

320
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:04,430
because otherwise, I have to
charge you 25K just for the info.

321
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:05,992
That's what they want
at AFI for a year.

322
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:09,295
OK, you tell me where my son is
or I'm going to the police.

323
00:23:09,363 --> 00:23:11,337
In fact, no, I'm going to go
to the police anyway...

324
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:12,937
you miserable jackass!

325
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:14,667
And I'm gonna press
every charge they come up with.

326
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:16,592
How's that for a big idea?

327
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,459
Fuck.

328
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:22,826
Fuck!

329
00:23:22,898 --> 00:23:26,346
God damn it! You know...

330
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:30,954
what I didn't figure
is that you wouldn't care.

331
00:23:31,024 --> 00:23:34,122
Which you don't. You haven't
even asked me his first name.

332
00:23:34,191 --> 00:23:36,809
I was gonna throw you that bone.
But you know what? Fuck you!

333
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,506
No, no, no,
you can tell me his first name.

334
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:40,136
No, you blew it.

335
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:29,801
Wow, you look...different.

336
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:34,341
Well, yeah,
it was a long time ago, OK?

337
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:36,267
What'd you look like back then?

338
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:38,667
I don't--Forget it.

339
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:40,707
Listen, do you know
who the father is?

340
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:43,114
Because if you say no,
maybe this guy will go to him.

341
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,740
No. Father unknown.

342
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,713
I mean, of course,
I know who the father was...

343
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,175
but that's what
I put down on the forms.

344
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:52,739
And the father's dead.
Plane crash.

345
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:54,666
And you don't have 25,000?

346
00:24:54,731 --> 00:24:57,765
No, I can barely pay the first
and second on the house!

347
00:24:57,835 --> 00:24:58,915
How can I--

348
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:01,322
What about your family?

349
00:25:01,387 --> 00:25:03,971
No, none of them
know about the baby.

350
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:06,082
Except my dad. He's dead, too.

351
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:09,603
You know a lot of dead people.

352
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,561
Well, it happens.

353
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:13,536
It's creepy.

354
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,905
I'm young,
and I don't even care

355
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,271
How lucky am I?

356
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:22,981
I'm young,
with a few bucks to spare

357
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,383
And I don't even try

358
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:28,645
I know it's all in my mind

359
00:25:28,712 --> 00:25:31,134
How lucky am I?

360
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:34,557
How lucky am I?

361
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:46,498
OK, that was awesome!

362
00:25:46,568 --> 00:25:49,252
You sounded just like Rain,
and she was good.

363
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:51,459
Really? 'Cause her tape sucks.

364
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:54,561
Can you slur and then have
your forehead hit the mike?

365
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,059
That was, like, her signature.

366
00:25:56,135 --> 00:25:58,175
Hey, Miles, let's get this
in the van for tomorrow.

367
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:01,595
God, I don't know
what to do with this song!

368
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,151
We could slow it down maybe.

369
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:06,881
Go slow?

370
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,403
Hey, do you guys mind
if I ask you something?

371
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,030
She's not in rehab for drugs.

372
00:26:12,102 --> 00:26:14,405
It's just booze.
Plus, she's a vomiter.

373
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,608
A fat vomiter,
which is fucking useless.

374
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:18,500
No...

375
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:21,283
just, why is Otis the leader?

376
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,318
I could drum better than him
and his backup vocals suck.

377
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:25,567
Look around.

378
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:27,525
Yeah, he's an untalented
little faggot...

379
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,280
but he's a rich,
untalented little faggot.

380
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,031
His dad owns Linux Hills Mall.
Or, like, most of it.

381
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,343
And he knows
every club owner in town.

382
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:34,590
You think we could buy
this stuff on our own?

383
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,187
- He's like Bill Gates.
- That makes sense.

384
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,048
For now.
Until Pappy finds out...

385
00:26:38,116 --> 00:26:40,931
his kid's a pickle smoker,
then we're history.

386
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:42,753
He's already got his suspicions.

387
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:44,446
He's gay?

388
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:47,298
Total cocksmooch.
He'll deny it, but...

389
00:26:47,364 --> 00:26:49,403
He's not gay. He just--
He looks gay.

390
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:51,777
Dude, you won't even
take a piss with him.

391
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,112
Hey, there's beer, too, guys.

392
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:57,537
Why do you think he's a drummer?

393
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:00,059
So he can stare
at our asses all night.

394
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:07,039
- That's him.
- Sure?

395
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:08,415
OK, yeah.

396
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:11,511
Hurry.

397
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:12,763
Hurry. Here.

398
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,343
Oh, God.

399
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,355
OK.

400
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:21,727
Not a good wiper.

401
00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:23,582
What kind of movies
does this guy make?

402
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:25,404
I don't know. He's an idiot.

403
00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:28,026
The kind idiots make, I guess.

404
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:31,063
All right,
we're looking for a file, OK?

405
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:33,275
Don't mess anything up,
if you can.

406
00:27:33,345 --> 00:27:35,484
Not that he'd notice.

407
00:27:36,992 --> 00:27:38,880
Yeah, check the duffel bag.

408
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,174
What if it's in his car?

409
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:43,321
Javi.

410
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,541
OK. This is--

411
00:27:51,614 --> 00:27:54,004
This is the form I signed.

412
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:58,965
I left this with them,
to go with the baby.

413
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:06,618
Who's Miriam?

414
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,824
Me. Is there anything else,
anywhere?

415
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:10,749
Did you see a file?

416
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:13,534
There's no name.

417
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:18,457
Mamie, we'd better go.

418
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:21,274
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Is that sentimental?

419
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:23,762
Not really.

420
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,909
Let's trade.
He'll never know the difference.

421
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,146
Thank you.

422
00:28:30,748 --> 00:28:33,783
Whoa! What the fuck is this?

423
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:35,859
- No, no!
- What are you doing here?

424
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,907
It's OK.
I followed you today. It's OK.

425
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,828
You think you're gonna
beat it out of me? I can't believe you!

426
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:43,063
My God, Nicky, no.
It's nothing like that, no.

427
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:44,561
What's he doing here, then?

428
00:28:48,252 --> 00:28:50,424
He's your new documentary.

429
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:53,622
OK? Javier, this is Nicky...

430
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,993
the director
I was telling you about.

431
00:28:57,498 --> 00:29:01,906
He's an immigrant, OK?
From Mexico. And...

432
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:05,360
he was in gangs.
They had gangs there, all right?

433
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:07,322
And he crossed the border...

434
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:12,056
so that he could put his life
back together in the States.

435
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:14,543
It's the American dream.

436
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:17,301
OK? It's good.

437
00:29:18,745 --> 00:29:20,501
Is that it?

438
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:22,903
That sucks!
You think that's as good...

439
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,359
as a mother finding the kid
she ditched?

440
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:27,321
All right, well,
if you're not interested in that--

441
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:30,581
No, I'm not interested, OK?
We're done.

442
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:33,550
I can get into AFI some other way.

443
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:35,315
I can shoot...

444
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:37,936
me getting into AFI.
That'd be a good--

445
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:40,691
- Just get the fuck out of here.
- All right, all right, we'll go.

446
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,931
So--But we'll work out
another deal.

447
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:45,236
No, you've got nothing to offer.
I got nothing to sell.

448
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:46,831
It's cool, man, OK? We get it.

449
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:50,417
OK? We couldn't think
of anything better, but you're right.

450
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:54,415
Who wants to see a movie
about a sex worker?

451
00:29:54,487 --> 00:29:56,145
What?

452
00:29:56,214 --> 00:29:59,314
A sex worker. That's what I do.

453
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:02,580
Massage, the works, you know?

454
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,949
For these rich
Beverly Hills ladies?

455
00:30:05,943 --> 00:30:07,699
But you know what? Sex--

456
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:10,189
No, sex shouldn't be in
a serious movie. Come on, Mamie.

457
00:30:10,264 --> 00:30:12,596
No, whoa, whoa. If it's...

458
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:17,298
necessary to the story, then...

459
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:20,180
What are we doing?
Now we're helping him?

460
00:30:20,245 --> 00:30:22,635
You want to know
where your son is, right?

461
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,011
How hard could it be?
We do a couple interviews...

462
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:27,149
we put it all on the computer.

463
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,650
Right? The tapes, everything?

464
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:30,864
He gives us the name,
and we give him the movie.

465
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,308
Yeah. Well, you heard him, though.

466
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,511
He wants to shoot you
doing the sex stuff.

467
00:30:34,581 --> 00:30:39,053
So we fake it. It'll be pretend.
You can be there to see.

468
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,711
Look, you're the boss.
I'm just the star.

469
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:45,965
Have you done that?
That kind of massage?

470
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:49,264
Happy ending? The full release?

471
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,338
Yeah. One time.

472
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:52,753
With you last week.

473
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,281
Nah. That was just a goof.

474
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:57,389
So is this. But at the end of it,
you're going to know who your son is.

475
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:00,723
Happy endings.

476
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:03,853
You know, that'd be a good title
for his movie.

477
00:31:03,922 --> 00:31:06,312
You should tell him that.
It could be your idea.

478
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,820
Oh, well. It's late.

479
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:27,150
The lady from Mexico said
I could take some of this home.

480
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:29,258
- She went to bed.
- Guatemala.

481
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:31,368
Really? She didn't tell me her name.

482
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:36,684
My cousin is charging me rent,
and she's got all her food labeled.

483
00:31:36,754 --> 00:31:39,786
She said it's so that her boyfriend has
what he wants when he comes home.

484
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:43,468
Oh, shit! There were subs left?
Do you mind?

485
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:49,228
Aw, yes!

486
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,852
Yeah, the thing is,
you need a day job.

487
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,367
We just get meals sometimes.
Couple bucks.

488
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,846
I told you that.

489
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:03,208
You always been rich?

490
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,028
I'm not rich. It's all relative.

491
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:08,647
That's what rich people
always say.

492
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:16,139
- Give me a tour.
- Oh, shit.

493
00:32:17,358 --> 00:32:20,260
Just a real quick one.

494
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:24,007
Is this the African room?

495
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:27,241
No, those are--
those are from Indonesia.

496
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,652
Come on, tour me.

497
00:32:28,717 --> 00:32:31,271
My dad's college roommate's.

498
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:34,538
- He's taking off his pants.
- I know.

499
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,883
These are some sculpturey things.

500
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:41,027
Where did--

501
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,837
Hey, don't!

502
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,639
It's freezing outside.
Your pool is so warm!

503
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:50,820
I know.

504
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:54,758
Oh, nice.

505
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:57,670
I just got this.

506
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,586
We're on this website
for new bands.

507
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:06,532
- What are you doing?
- I gotta spend the night, OK?

508
00:33:06,602 --> 00:33:08,839
I just need a break.
I'm a little buzzed.

509
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:10,281
I don't know. I--

510
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:12,867
Oh, just friends. Come on.

511
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:15,426
You're cute, but I don't know.

512
00:33:15,497 --> 00:33:17,537
Have you ever slept
with a girl before?

513
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:21,024
OK, duh, I'm 22.

514
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:22,659
I can drive you home.

515
00:33:37,353 --> 00:33:39,011
Look...

516
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,897
I really want to spend the night.

517
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:44,066
I figure you should get
something out of it, too.

518
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:47,683
- But I've got a girlfriend.
- Otis, come on.

519
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:49,858
You should try it.

520
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:52,294
You might not be
who you think you are.

521
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,040
You can leave your watch on.

522
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:12,828
Oh, I don't have a condom.

523
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:15,553
Have you ever had sex
with anybody before?

524
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:19,234
Not exactly.

525
00:34:19,302 --> 00:34:21,091
So you don't need one.

526
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,238
Here.

527
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:28,476
OK.

528
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:32,004
I'm sorry.
I'm a little distracted.

529
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,923
Oh, the tits. Right?

530
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,330
Here.

531
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:39,805
Is that better?

532
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:46,012
Yeah.

533
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:44,160
- Good morning, Mr. Frank.
- Hey.

534
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:47,388
- Let me get this.
- No, I got it, I got it.

535
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:49,595
Their band played here.

536
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:50,908
All right.

537
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:19,549
Oh, hello. Are you the dad?

538
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:21,555
What?

539
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,637
Are you the dad?

540
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,327
Yeah. I'm Frank.

541
00:36:26,397 --> 00:36:28,732
I'm Jude. I'm with Otis.

542
00:36:28,798 --> 00:36:29,780
OK.

543
00:36:31,228 --> 00:36:32,690
See ya.

544
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:33,844
Yeah.

545
00:36:40,508 --> 00:36:42,035
Your dad's home.

546
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:45,586
Oh, shit! He's early.

547
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,897
You totally owe me, dude.

548
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:49,590
He does not think
you're a 'mo anymore.

549
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,508
Hey, I am not gay.

550
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:53,651
Hello?

551
00:36:57,147 --> 00:36:58,576
You hello.

552
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,359
- Hey, Otis.
- Hey.

553
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:23,474
Nice girl.

554
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:25,554
Yeah, she's in the band now.

555
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,831
OK. Listen...

556
00:37:29,274 --> 00:37:31,606
don't make Dignora
wash the sheets, OK?

557
00:37:31,672 --> 00:37:34,935
She's like your mother.

558
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:50,579
OK, Gil.
I have something to tell you.

559
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:53,102
But before I do,
you have to promise me...

560
00:37:53,176 --> 00:37:55,248
that I'm the boss of this, OK?

561
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:56,695
What?

562
00:37:56,759 --> 00:38:00,786
OK, I've discovered something,
which I don't have to tell you...

563
00:38:00,855 --> 00:38:02,611
so the fact
that I'm doing that...

564
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,371
means you have to
hand it over to me...

565
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,602
which means
that what I say goes, OK?

566
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,360
No.

567
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:11,667
Fine. Up to you.

568
00:38:11,735 --> 00:38:13,938
Absolutely fine.

569
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:16,367
It's cool.

570
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:26,224
Come on, please?
It's really good.

571
00:38:26,294 --> 00:38:28,595
This is really great.
You'll thank me.

572
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:31,148
- If you want to tell me, tell me.
- OK. You promise I'm the boss?

573
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:33,076
How old are you?

574
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:34,965
Look, only I cared to put
this thing together.

575
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,418
I think that gives me a little ownership.
I'm not crazy here.

576
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:40,308
I mean,
this is really, really good.

577
00:38:40,374 --> 00:38:42,348
OK, you're the boss, I agree.

578
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:44,787
In all things pertaining to this
extraordinary development...

579
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:46,379
I will be guided by you,
is that OK?

580
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:48,591
- "Guided" meaning?
- Charley!

581
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,514
OK.

582
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,744
Max is your kid.

583
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:57,008
Your biological descendant.

584
00:38:57,077 --> 00:39:00,207
Your spawn.

585
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:06,959
What're you talking about?

586
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:08,882
OK, this has been
bugging me for months...

587
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,638
but now I'm so sure.

588
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:14,668
Fact: 3 1/2 years ago,
you donated sperm to their gyno.

589
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:16,168
Yes.

590
00:39:16,243 --> 00:39:18,664
Fact: After three months of trying,
Pam said it wasn't working...

591
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:20,647
and they were gonna get a donor
from a sperm bank.

592
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:22,794
Yes. They were
upset about it, remember?

593
00:39:22,865 --> 00:39:23,945
Pam was a wreck.

594
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:26,384
Fact: six months later,
they're pregnant.

595
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:30,672
Fact: Sperm can be kept viable
for up to twelve years...

596
00:39:30,738 --> 00:39:33,901
if frozen correctly,
according to this website I found.

597
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:37,678
And fact: When your parents
came to visit a year ago...

598
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:40,680
Pam, Max, and Diane all got sick...

599
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,476
and couldn't come over
to visit because your mother...

600
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:45,228
would recognize Max
as her grandchild.

601
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:47,752
And, finally...

602
00:39:51,408 --> 00:39:53,646
You...Max.

603
00:39:53,714 --> 00:39:55,207
All kids look alike!

604
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,929
No, no, no. No, you see it.

605
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:01,131
You see it,
but you can't believe it.

606
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,303
I can't believe it because--

607
00:40:03,374 --> 00:40:04,967
Come on,
it doesn't make sense.

608
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,762
Why would they lie?

609
00:40:06,832 --> 00:40:09,003
Because this way,
Max is all theirs.

610
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:10,980
They don't have to consult you
about anything.

611
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:12,265
Sure, they'd lose a little money...

612
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:13,895
but it's the power,
that's what they want.

613
00:40:13,966 --> 00:40:15,528
They don't have
to consider us at all.

614
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,769
But if that's how
they feel about it...

615
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:19,464
why did they even try with us
in the first place?

616
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:22,283
I don't know. Sentiment.

617
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:24,075
But then they thought
better of it.

618
00:40:24,142 --> 00:40:26,182
Maybe we were too enthusiastic.

619
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:28,392
Maybe we got excited
and started talking about colleges...

620
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:30,317
or said something nice
about sugar.

621
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:32,934
OK, then, you know,
they changed their mind.

622
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:34,892
Why not really use sperm
from a sperm bank?

623
00:40:34,956 --> 00:40:36,778
Because you're a sure thing.

624
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:39,692
Look at you.
You're smart, you're sexy.

625
00:40:39,756 --> 00:40:43,270
You're not faggy at all.
The gayest thing about you is me.

626
00:40:46,957 --> 00:40:49,574
I've known Pam since
the eighth grade. She wouldn't lie.

627
00:40:49,643 --> 00:40:53,637
She's a mother.
It's a sick, sick bond.

628
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,530
Think of yours.

629
00:40:55,596 --> 00:40:58,945
Think of mine.
It's unwholesome.

630
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,679
We have to call them.

631
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:02,407
No, no, they'll just deny it.

632
00:41:02,475 --> 00:41:05,323
Look, we have options.
We have plenty of options.

633
00:41:05,388 --> 00:41:07,177
I think you should just let it sink in.

634
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:09,663
- God!
- I'm the boss of this, remember?

635
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:13,219
You're too emotional.
Just...trust me.

636
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,007
Did you guys hear that thing
on NPR this morning?

637
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,350
About sperm.

638
00:41:17,418 --> 00:41:19,077
Oh, no, no, no,
I didn't hear that one.

639
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:21,667
- Well, maybe it was yesterday.
- What was that?

640
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:24,902
Just about storage
and freezing and stuff.

641
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,490
Pam, those jeans are great.
Were those the ones--

642
00:41:27,562 --> 00:41:28,773
Where did we get those?
On Melrose?

643
00:41:28,842 --> 00:41:30,468
Those are the ones you picked out,
the French ones.

644
00:41:30,538 --> 00:41:32,545
- They're so good.
- Thanks.

645
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:35,399
Do you guys know
how long sperm keeps?

646
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:36,578
- No.
- Do tell.

647
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,860
Twelve years.

648
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:38,878
- What?
- Yeah.

649
00:41:38,953 --> 00:41:40,807
In the proper, you know, facility.

650
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,142
I don't know
what it would be at home.

651
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,348
Did you hear
the other story, though?

652
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:47,359
It must have been after that,
on the Khmer Rouge...

653
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:49,920
about that guy who was growing
vegetables behind the torture room?

654
00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:51,933
- No.
- That was devastating.

655
00:41:52,008 --> 00:41:53,862
I almost had to pull the car over.

656
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:57,703
- Was Max in the car?
- Yeah, but he was sleeping.

657
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:59,873
Sugar, bad. Torture, fine.

658
00:41:59,944 --> 00:42:00,926
Is that big enough, right here?

659
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:02,592
That's great,
that's perfect for me.

660
00:42:02,663 --> 00:42:03,973
Can I get some ice cream
with that?

661
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:06,047
- Oh, absolutely.
- I'll get it.

662
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,842
You know,
there's Tofutti in there, too.

663
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:09,852
- Oh, good.
- You should try it.

664
00:42:45,925 --> 00:42:47,713
What are you still doing here?
Go play dominoes.

665
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,604
Get me some scissors
from the bathroom.

666
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,716
What?

667
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,196
We can take a DNA sample
from his hair...

668
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:53,438
but I can't pluck any
without waking him.

669
00:42:53,508 --> 00:42:55,003
What are you, crazy?
Just get away from him.

670
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:56,670
Oh, my God, my car keys,
I forgot this.

671
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,268
You're not doing it.
Just give me those.

672
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,484
Yeah!
Come on, this is gonna work.

673
00:42:59,555 --> 00:43:00,929
Charley!

674
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,239
Listen, I know
what those tests cost.

675
00:43:02,308 --> 00:43:04,195
No, Charley.

676
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:08,728
Look at him, he's so cute
when he's sleeping.

677
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:10,691
Yeah.

678
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:15,007
How can you not believe this?
Look at him!

679
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:17,791
There's a photograph of you
at home looking just like this.

680
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:20,411
Stick him in Tinkerbell PJ's,
it's the spitting image.

681
00:43:20,483 --> 00:43:24,574
What is the matter with you? Jesus!
We are going to drop this, OK?

682
00:43:24,642 --> 00:43:27,131
Look at him. He's happy,
they're happy, we're happy.

683
00:43:27,203 --> 00:43:28,762
Just leave it alone, all right?

684
00:43:28,835 --> 00:43:30,143
Yeah, but you believe me now.

685
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:31,387
- No!
- Yeah.

686
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:33,564
I don't. Promise me, all right?

687
00:43:33,634 --> 00:43:34,976
I don't care
if you're positive about this.

688
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,430
Just leave it alone.
I'm serious.

689
00:43:37,504 --> 00:43:39,228
OK. Fine.

690
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,549
I'm not leaving here until
you're back in that living room.

691
00:43:43,616 --> 00:43:45,143
Go.

692
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,058
Aw, man!

693
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,949
This is awesome!

694
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:03,959
I'm so going to buy this from you
when we're done.

695
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:06,203
No, forget it, OK?
It's all going back to the store...

696
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:08,760
before the credit card bill
comes, OK?

697
00:44:08,832 --> 00:44:11,133
So don't drop it.
That's not funny.

698
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,824
Don't you know any of this stuff?

699
00:44:12,895 --> 00:44:15,961
Oh, wow, you look really pretty
if I stand far away and I use the zoom.

700
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,688
Thank you.

701
00:44:17,757 --> 00:44:19,546
OK, it's back to normal now.

702
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:21,044
- OK.
- Cool.

703
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,547
All right, here, gimme the camera.

704
00:44:22,623 --> 00:44:23,604
OK, here, sure.

705
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,817
OK, but right now.
Thank you.

706
00:44:26,973 --> 00:44:29,210
All right, let's see.

707
00:44:29,277 --> 00:44:31,187
Just have to open the program.

708
00:44:31,262 --> 00:44:33,050
Here it comes.

709
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:34,459
There it is!

710
00:44:35,901 --> 00:44:38,170
Who's that handsome guy, huh?

711
00:44:38,238 --> 00:44:39,929
Cool! Make it rewind
through the computer.

712
00:44:39,998 --> 00:44:41,852
OK, no! Not in my room!

713
00:44:41,918 --> 00:44:44,820
All right? It's this room,
the bathroom, the kitchen.

714
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:46,323
Everything else is off-limits.

715
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:47,608
There. You're sleeping with Javier.

716
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:51,481
You could've told me.

717
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:53,370
"This is my boyfriend.
He's a sex worker."

718
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:56,948
- You're embarrassed, huh?
- No, it's none of your business.

719
00:44:57,019 --> 00:44:58,929
And it doesn't affect
any of this, does it?

720
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:00,084
Wait, wait, wait,
rewind, rewind, rewind.

721
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,978
Hey, who's that guy?

722
00:45:02,044 --> 00:45:03,059
Oh, my ex-husband.

723
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,594
- Still hung up on him?
- No.

724
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:08,693
That's there to remind me
what he's like when he calls.

725
00:45:08,763 --> 00:45:11,797
He lost $62,000 that night.

726
00:45:11,866 --> 00:45:13,557
That could've been my money!

727
00:45:13,626 --> 00:45:15,897
Yeah, that's what
really hurts about it.

728
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,207
Does Javier gamble?

729
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:21,814
I don't know. I don't care.
I'm not planning to marry him.

730
00:45:21,883 --> 00:45:25,198
Yeah, duh! He's creepy.

731
00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:27,607
"Senor Fingers!"

732
00:45:27,673 --> 00:45:29,648
I don't want him handing me
any cigarettes...

733
00:45:29,722 --> 00:45:31,631
if you know what I mean.

734
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:33,429
So, you're just into him
for the sex.

735
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:34,958
'Cause, I mean, I get that,
you know.

736
00:45:35,034 --> 00:45:37,206
He's dangerous. He's, like...

737
00:45:37,273 --> 00:45:40,885
gangs and handjobs and Mexican.

738
00:45:40,953 --> 00:45:42,612
I can see where
that'd be attractive...

739
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,656
but, you know,
you've married the bad boy before.

740
00:45:44,729 --> 00:45:47,379
Mr. Vegas, huh? Live and learn.

741
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:49,652
Naturally, as my extortionist...

742
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,695
your insights
are particularly valuable.

743
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:53,559
Then why is he holding back,
though?

744
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,081
I mean, bring on the ring, dude!
Like, he should marry you.

745
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,968
He should totally marry you.
You're a step up.

746
00:46:00,153 --> 00:46:02,934
OK. Well, this is in.
It's in the hard drive.

747
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:04,886
When we're done with this,
we can edit.

748
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,213
Watch.

749
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:13,077
Don't. No, don't. Oh, come on!

750
00:46:13,143 --> 00:46:17,104
That's not a zoom, incidentally.
Just the way it is.

751
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:18,768
Like a penis, only bigger.

752
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:20,115
Who raised you?

753
00:46:29,144 --> 00:46:32,404
How lucky am I?

754
00:46:32,471 --> 00:46:37,707
I'm yours, and I don't even care

755
00:46:37,783 --> 00:46:41,010
How lucky am I?

756
00:46:41,076 --> 00:46:42,964
I'm young

757
00:46:43,029 --> 00:46:46,411
With a few bucks to spare

758
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:50,130
And I don't even try

759
00:46:50,197 --> 00:46:55,411
I know it's all in my mind

760
00:46:55,476 --> 00:47:02,732
How lucky am I?

761
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:13,840
I can't believe
all my good fortune

762
00:47:16,882 --> 00:47:21,868
I count my blessings every day

763
00:47:25,715 --> 00:47:32,588
Should hurt to be so fun-loving

764
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:38,187
My life must be a crime

765
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:41,804
How lucky am I?

766
00:47:41,873 --> 00:47:44,427
He says,
"I can't take 67 more of those!"

767
00:47:46,705 --> 00:47:47,819
How's the food?

768
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:49,264
Thanks, Mr. McKee. It's great.

769
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,881
Yeah, we were just going
to hit up Taco Bell.

770
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,740
Well, it's my pleasure.
You guys are good.

771
00:47:53,808 --> 00:47:56,525
- How's the new amp?
- Makes a difference, yeah.

772
00:47:56,593 --> 00:47:59,974
You are really, really talented.

773
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:03,910
Thank you.
I'm just trying to hang in there.

774
00:48:03,985 --> 00:48:05,261
What do you mean?

775
00:48:05,328 --> 00:48:06,986
She's just helping us out
until Rain gets out.

776
00:48:07,727 --> 00:48:10,793
Yeah, I need to get
a real job, anyway.

777
00:48:10,863 --> 00:48:13,710
I got evicted earlier this month.

778
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:15,782
Actually, the guy that
I was subletting with got evicted...

779
00:48:15,855 --> 00:48:18,441
and none of my checks
made it to the landlady...

780
00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:19,974
so that was fun.

781
00:48:20,048 --> 00:48:22,895
Speaking of that, we should probably
get you back to your cousin's.

782
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:25,829
Wait. You're not sleeping
on someone's couch?

783
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:27,147
It's an air bed.

784
00:48:27,215 --> 00:48:29,580
You just push the button,
boom, it's full-sized.

785
00:48:29,646 --> 00:48:31,588
Otis, what is the matter
with you, dude?

786
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:32,709
Dude?

787
00:48:32,782 --> 00:48:34,440
Listen, we got
an empty pool house.

788
00:48:34,509 --> 00:48:36,264
You move in there
till you find a place.

789
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,406
- Oh, I don't know.
- We practice there, Dad.

790
00:48:38,477 --> 00:48:39,972
That's what I'm saying.
It's no use to me.

791
00:48:40,046 --> 00:48:42,663
It's got a big bedroom
and a full bathroom. You'll love it.

792
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:45,930
- Well, I don't know.
- I do. It's fine.

793
00:48:45,997 --> 00:48:47,459
Miles, you'll know this.

794
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:52,039
What would it take to get all you cats
into a studio to cut a CD?

795
00:48:52,107 --> 00:48:54,890
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

796
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:58,184
Nice car.

797
00:48:59,788 --> 00:49:02,985
Well, my dad's letting me
run out the lease.

798
00:49:03,052 --> 00:49:05,571
Isn't it nice not being a fag?

799
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:09,187
This is the thing...

800
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,128
I'll totally help you find a new place.

801
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:13,446
Because this is temporary.

802
00:49:13,515 --> 00:49:15,653
That's what he said,
until you find your own place.

803
00:49:15,724 --> 00:49:18,090
Oh, what's it to you?

804
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:20,097
What do you mean?
This is too fast.

805
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:21,698
We're sleeping together.

806
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,641
Yeah, once. It wasn't that fast.
It was good.

807
00:49:24,714 --> 00:49:28,063
I'm just saying we've got to be
our own, independent people.

808
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:29,600
Suddenly,
we're, like, living together?

809
00:49:29,674 --> 00:49:33,570
You know what? It's fine.
'Cause we're breaking up.

810
00:49:33,643 --> 00:49:34,755
What?

811
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:37,762
Look, I'm not going to screw you
and your dad.

812
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:40,223
You're not going to fuck my dad.

813
00:49:40,298 --> 00:49:41,954
He is 44, OK?

814
00:49:42,025 --> 00:49:44,992
So, the first guy I slept with
was 38 and I was 13.

815
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,592
My best friend's dad.

816
00:49:46,663 --> 00:49:48,998
You're making that up.
That's from <i>American Beauty</i>.

817
00:49:49,064 --> 00:49:50,374
It was exactly like that.

818
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,830
Except I didn't have roses
coming out of my tits.

819
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:55,294
My dad has lots of girlfriends,
and he spends money on them...

820
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:57,734
but he doesn't marry them,
so you can forget that.

821
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,775
Why would I want to marry him?

822
00:49:59,848 --> 00:50:02,979
Like that's what I need--
a gay stepson.

823
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:07,454
You think I'm just going to let someone
take advantage of my father?

824
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:11,140
Hey, butt boy, listen...

825
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:14,462
if you don't help me with this...

826
00:50:14,536 --> 00:50:16,161
I'm going to tell him you're gay...

827
00:50:16,232 --> 00:50:19,939
and then you'll be out
on your ass, not me, OK?

828
00:50:20,966 --> 00:50:22,046
So...

829
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:26,108
First thing you gotta do is,
you gotta break up with me...

830
00:50:26,182 --> 00:50:29,532
because there's no way your dad's
gonna fuck his son's first real girlfriend.

831
00:50:29,606 --> 00:50:30,883
He's got morals.

832
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,925
Yeah, well,
I am dumping you, OK?

833
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:34,208
Just so you know.

834
00:50:34,277 --> 00:50:37,595
Yeah. But let me tell you why.

835
00:50:39,877 --> 00:50:42,364
- Breakfast?
- No, thanks.

836
00:50:42,437 --> 00:50:44,347
Thought you were out
in the pool house.

837
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:45,632
Why?

838
00:50:45,702 --> 00:50:47,906
Otis, it's OK if you want
to spend the night with Jude.

839
00:50:47,974 --> 00:50:50,526
It's fine.
You're not a teenager anymore.

840
00:50:50,598 --> 00:50:54,338
- She get settled in all right?
- She's moving out.

841
00:50:54,404 --> 00:50:55,898
What?

842
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:57,466
We broke up.

843
00:50:57,539 --> 00:50:59,776
I mean, I broke up with her.

844
00:50:59,844 --> 00:51:01,665
She's moving back
to her cousin's...

845
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:03,520
and she might not even be
in the band anymore.

846
00:51:03,587 --> 00:51:05,858
- I don't know.
- What happened?

847
00:51:07,268 --> 00:51:10,530
She lied to me about her age.

848
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:13,945
She's not 24, she's 29.

849
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,735
She's too old.

850
00:51:16,803 --> 00:51:20,697
- She's 29?
- Yeah, for another month.

851
00:51:20,771 --> 00:51:24,569
I don't want to date a 30-year-old.
I'm 22. You know?

852
00:51:24,643 --> 00:51:26,716
I could be in college.

853
00:51:26,787 --> 00:51:28,643
Why would she lie about her age?

854
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:31,640
I just assumed.

855
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,648
I don't know. Anyway, she...

856
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:37,339
she wants to use the pool today.
I said it was OK.

857
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:43,106
Her cousin's at work,
and she gave back her key.

858
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,689
Well, I'm sorry things
turned out this way.

859
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,718
I'm going over to AIvin's.

860
00:51:50,786 --> 00:51:53,173
In the Lexus.

861
00:51:53,249 --> 00:51:54,774
Sure, sure.

862
00:51:54,848 --> 00:51:56,409
Sure, whatever.

863
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,745
Hey.

864
00:52:10,815 --> 00:52:12,473
Oh, hey, Mr. McKee.

865
00:52:12,544 --> 00:52:14,746
No, Frank.

866
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:16,059
Listen...

867
00:52:17,503 --> 00:52:19,228
I hear things are a little tricky.

868
00:52:19,295 --> 00:52:20,953
Yeah.

869
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,823
Thanks for the pool house thing
and all.

870
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:26,968
I don't think it's going to work out.

871
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:29,526
You know, I'd really hate
to see you leave the band.

872
00:52:29,598 --> 00:52:31,834
They really need you.

873
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:34,172
Well, it's kind of up to Otis.

874
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:35,645
I could talk to him.

875
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,525
I mean, every woman lies
about her age a little bit.

876
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:40,630
That's what he told you
it was about?

877
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:44,635
Man, it's not that.

878
00:52:46,107 --> 00:52:48,410
He's got someone else.

879
00:52:48,478 --> 00:52:50,365
Lane.

880
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:53,909
Lane? That's a girl's name?

881
00:52:55,293 --> 00:52:57,496
He didn't tell you
anything about her?

882
00:52:57,565 --> 00:53:00,663
You don't know your son
very well, do you?

883
00:53:00,731 --> 00:53:02,707
Well, I don't think
you should leave.

884
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,682
I insist you stay.
I'm going to talk to Otis...

885
00:53:05,757 --> 00:53:08,243
'cause that's no way to treat
somebody you care about.

886
00:53:09,755 --> 00:53:11,992
I wish he was more like you.

887
00:53:12,061 --> 00:53:16,053
Well, he's young, and maybe
I could have done a better job.

888
00:53:16,123 --> 00:53:18,545
But I was a kid
when I had him, practically.

889
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:19,994
Do you know what?

890
00:53:21,146 --> 00:53:23,415
You remind me
of the first boy I dated.

891
00:53:24,795 --> 00:53:26,616
Hardly a boy.

892
00:53:26,682 --> 00:53:28,088
Now you're lying.

893
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,681
Oh, my God.

894
00:53:47,034 --> 00:53:48,976
Oh, my God.

895
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:51,831
Yeah, that's why
I've been behaving so weird lately.

896
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,784
You know. We both have.

897
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,572
I just--I--
I can't even believe this.

898
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:57,200
I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

899
00:53:59,479 --> 00:54:03,790
All right.
So...what kind of disease?

900
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,145
He won't say, you know? He--

901
00:54:08,216 --> 00:54:10,484
It's neurological, he told me that.

902
00:54:10,552 --> 00:54:11,860
Oh, my God.

903
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:14,196
Yeah. Hereditary.

904
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,341
All the males in his family
have to be tested for it.

905
00:54:22,614 --> 00:54:24,558
Do you--I mean,
what's the name of it?

906
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,653
It's not MS, I know that.

907
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:30,799
Well, is it like MS?

908
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:33,836
Well, it's...I don't know.

909
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,146
Are you forgetting the name of it?

910
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:38,285
He didn't want me to interfere,
you know?

911
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,819
He just thought I would be,
you know...

912
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:41,037
that I would be on the internet...

913
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:43,694
and I'd be talking to doctors
and nagging him.

914
00:54:43,766 --> 00:54:45,588
Like I'm that guy, you know.
I'm not that guy.

915
00:54:45,654 --> 00:54:47,988
All right. What are the symptoms?
Do you know the symptoms?

916
00:54:48,054 --> 00:54:51,053
Yeah. Did you know
Gil's grandfather...

917
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:52,849
when you were
at high school together?

918
00:54:52,918 --> 00:54:54,324
No. I don't think so.

919
00:54:54,389 --> 00:54:58,665
I don't--I don't even remember Gil
talking about him or mentioning him.

920
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:02,538
Well, I'm not surprised.
It's pretty debilitating.

921
00:55:02,614 --> 00:55:04,469
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

922
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:05,710
Hey, it's not fatal.

923
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,991
- It's OK.
- It's not?

924
00:55:07,061 --> 00:55:10,255
No, no, no. It's just untreatable.

925
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,291
Yeah.

926
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:18,183
All right. So, when--
I mean, what do we do?

927
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:22,894
Pam, you mustn't say that we--
You can't tell him we spoke.

928
00:55:22,964 --> 00:55:25,810
Oh, God. All right. I mean, I--
Yeah.

929
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:29,039
He would kill me
if he knew we'd spoken.

930
00:55:29,106 --> 00:55:32,967
- Oh, my God. Max!
- Max?

931
00:55:33,042 --> 00:55:35,758
I've got to go pick him up.
I gotta get myself together.

932
00:55:35,826 --> 00:55:38,576
- That's the one comfort we have.
- What?

933
00:55:38,643 --> 00:55:41,327
You know, that you guys
couldn't get pregnant...

934
00:55:41,394 --> 00:55:44,209
with Gil's, you know.

935
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:46,609
Like your body knew somehow.

936
00:55:46,675 --> 00:55:50,087
Just said...not allowed.

937
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:53,642
I gotta go. I gotta go. Sorry.

938
00:55:53,712 --> 00:55:56,876
Hey, Pam,
I think it's going to be OK.

939
00:55:58,673 --> 00:56:01,639
I gotta say, man, I'm glad
she's not here for first day...

940
00:56:01,712 --> 00:56:04,046
'cause she's, like, opinionated.

941
00:56:07,728 --> 00:56:08,807
All right.

942
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:14,317
What did you do
to your face, man?

943
00:56:14,384 --> 00:56:16,773
- What do you mean?
- You got a fake moustache on.

944
00:56:16,847 --> 00:56:18,091
Oh, yeah. You like it?

945
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:19,720
It's so my clients don't notice me,
you know?

946
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:21,581
It's a little make-up, too,
that Mamie has.

947
00:56:21,647 --> 00:56:25,191
Mamie's white, OK?
You look like a scared Mexican.

948
00:56:25,263 --> 00:56:26,670
Like, down at the border
on the news.

949
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:28,229
Hey, come on.
That's my face up there, OK?

950
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:29,546
It's gonna look good
through the camera.

951
00:56:29,615 --> 00:56:30,792
- Just shoot.
- It's cool, man.

952
00:56:30,861 --> 00:56:31,876
I don't know how
it's gonna read. I guess--

953
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,860
- Come on. I gotta go.
- Well, it looks all right.

954
00:56:33,934 --> 00:56:36,454
OK. We're rolling, we're rolling.

955
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,217
Came up with a list of questions
that, you know...

956
00:56:38,286 --> 00:56:40,041
everybody who's ever gotten
a massage, I'm sure, wants to know.

957
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:41,452
Have you had a massage, ever?

958
00:56:41,518 --> 00:56:43,341
Yeah, I have.
Actually, let's start with that.

959
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:45,827
What do you do
when somebody lets one out...

960
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:48,137
while you're massaging them?
Do you just keep going?

961
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:51,240
Is that what the incense is for?
Take me through that.

962
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:52,771
You farted today inside.

963
00:56:52,846 --> 00:56:54,820
- No.
- You said it was her!

964
00:56:54,893 --> 00:56:56,616
- Cut!
- You know something?

965
00:56:56,686 --> 00:56:58,212
Women don't fart like that,
my friend.

966
00:56:58,285 --> 00:57:00,193
Do me a favor?
Take a picture of me.

967
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:04,196
I forgot, I wanted to do it before.
So we'll get back to this.

968
00:57:04,268 --> 00:57:05,958
Ready?

969
00:57:06,028 --> 00:57:08,580
Your fly's open.

970
00:57:08,652 --> 00:57:09,764
Good.

971
00:57:09,836 --> 00:57:11,844
Here we go. What's it like...

972
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:15,690
when some woman
you're massaging lets one out?

973
00:57:15,755 --> 00:57:17,894
OK, they're cooked
all the way now.

974
00:57:17,963 --> 00:57:19,557
I didn't know. I like 'em pink.

975
00:57:19,628 --> 00:57:23,621
OK. Maybe we have five minutes,
in a montage...

976
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,479
with music covering the stupidity.

977
00:57:25,547 --> 00:57:28,418
- We shot for two hours.
- Yeah, and it's garbage.

978
00:57:28,491 --> 00:57:33,542
Nicky, who cares who invented
that donut that people put their face in?

979
00:57:33,611 --> 00:57:34,788
It's called a cradle, OK?

980
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:37,574
A face cradle,
and I think it's interesting.

981
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:40,488
And farts?
And who pays for the lotion?

982
00:57:40,554 --> 00:57:43,106
And, so, OK,
how do people tip you?

983
00:57:43,178 --> 00:57:45,184
Because they're naked,
so where's the wallet?

984
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:47,810
That's neat, OK?
The little envelopes at the front desk?

985
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:48,996
I didn't know that.

986
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:51,301
All right. Do you want
to get into film school?

987
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:53,441
- Yeah.
- Because I don't care.

988
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,368
I just have to help you
make a documentary.

989
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:58,182
As good as the one
you're not letting me make.

990
00:57:58,249 --> 00:58:00,614
No. No. Just a documentary.

991
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:02,819
If you want a stupid interview...

992
00:58:02,889 --> 00:58:05,093
that you could see
on the local news, fine.

993
00:58:05,162 --> 00:58:07,398
But if you want this to be good...

994
00:58:07,465 --> 00:58:10,499
if you want people
to care about him...

995
00:58:10,568 --> 00:58:12,161
you have to have a point of view.

996
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:13,606
I have a point of view!

997
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:15,459
This guy has it made,
and I care...

998
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:18,015
because I want to see him
get all these ladies off.

999
00:58:18,087 --> 00:58:20,030
- That's your reasoning?
- Yes!

1000
00:58:20,103 --> 00:58:22,078
Oh, OK. All right.
Well, I'm relieved.

1001
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,842
What does that mean?

1002
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:26,398
It means someone smart
would be harder to please.

1003
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:29,505
But if you're stupid,
hey, just makes my job easier.

1004
00:58:29,575 --> 00:58:31,167
What did you just call me?

1005
00:58:32,744 --> 00:58:36,038
Forget it. It's OK.

1006
00:58:38,022 --> 00:58:41,252
You know,
you say "stupid" too much.

1007
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:45,437
I just mean, I think
you're better than this...

1008
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,754
or you could be.

1009
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,951
Yeah, well I think that goes
for everybody...

1010
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:52,192
from what I can see
from right here.

1011
00:59:01,925 --> 00:59:05,023
Anyway, the makeup blows.
I'll give you that.

1012
00:59:05,092 --> 00:59:08,475
It's no fun thinking of him
nailing all these women...

1013
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:11,843
if he might be a homo,
but that's just me.

1014
00:59:13,027 --> 00:59:14,521
That's my beer.

1015
00:59:16,003 --> 00:59:17,433
Sorry.

1016
00:59:17,509 --> 00:59:18,491
It's OK.

1017
00:59:18,565 --> 00:59:21,728
OK. All right.

1018
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:23,804
It's gonna be OK.

1019
00:59:23,876 --> 00:59:25,217
All right,
well, it's gonna be good.

1020
00:59:25,284 --> 00:59:26,843
We'll just go through it again.

1021
00:59:26,914 --> 00:59:29,881
I got two hours of footage.

1022
00:59:29,954 --> 00:59:31,002
Yeah.

1023
00:59:31,075 --> 00:59:32,732
Will you do me a favor,
for my sanity?

1024
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,110
Will you just say to me--

1025
00:59:34,178 --> 00:59:36,033
Please just say to me right now...

1026
00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:39,546
five minutes was an overestimation.

1027
01:00:06,656 --> 01:00:08,543
Jesus Christ.

1028
01:00:10,655 --> 01:00:11,900
Time to go.

1029
01:00:14,304 --> 01:00:15,732
Hey, Charley.

1030
01:00:15,808 --> 01:00:17,303
That was Pam and Diane
from the car.

1031
01:00:17,376 --> 01:00:19,447
They're on their way over.

1032
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:21,243
I thought we were seeing them
tonight at Jill's.

1033
01:00:21,312 --> 01:00:23,767
They say they have
something to tell us.

1034
01:00:26,815 --> 01:00:28,637
Wow. That was fast.

1035
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:36,471
You know, don't you?

1036
01:00:42,622 --> 01:00:45,436
All right, guys.
I don't know where to begin.

1037
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:47,323
- Oh, well...
- So...

1038
01:00:47,389 --> 01:00:50,870
Look, you know, these things,
they just get out of hand.

1039
01:00:50,942 --> 01:00:52,632
I mean, you know,
you want to tell...

1040
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:54,523
you want to get it off your chest.

1041
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:57,655
And I'm sure every night
you think you will...

1042
01:00:57,725 --> 01:00:59,994
and it just gets
harder and harder.

1043
01:01:00,143 --> 01:01:01,993
We're your best friends. I mean...

1044
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,229
I know, but, you know,
we're still that, right?

1045
01:01:04,295 --> 01:01:05,676
- I mean...
- Oh, God, yeah.

1046
01:01:05,743 --> 01:01:07,909
This doesn't change anything.
For me it doesn't.

1047
01:01:07,977 --> 01:01:10,469
No, but also,
trust is everything, and...

1048
01:01:10,537 --> 01:01:13,540
It's not just about trust.

1049
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:15,582
Gil, how are you feeling?

1050
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:21,634
Well...wow.

1051
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:25,730
Well, I'm feeling better
now that we're facing it.

1052
01:01:25,806 --> 01:01:29,729
But, you know,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

1053
01:01:29,805 --> 01:01:32,769
Why don't you say
what you came here to say?

1054
01:01:34,285 --> 01:01:36,423
It's over, OK?

1055
01:01:36,491 --> 01:01:39,494
The secret, OK?
We're done with that.

1056
01:01:39,561 --> 01:01:43,136
It's done. And now we just...

1057
01:01:43,213 --> 01:01:45,284
we want to be here
in any way we can.

1058
01:01:45,352 --> 01:01:47,875
OK? I mean,
the health system's tricky...

1059
01:01:47,952 --> 01:01:50,569
- and, well, you need advocates--
- Pam! Pam!

1060
01:01:50,636 --> 01:01:52,007
You got to let us be that for you--

1061
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:53,446
Pam, can I have
a conversation with you?

1062
01:01:53,514 --> 01:01:54,721
Charley,
I'm gonna bring you into this.

1063
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,487
- I need to speak to you in private.
- And Charley, too.

1064
01:01:56,555 --> 01:01:59,854
That should be obvious,
but you've got to let us all help you.

1065
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,073
I'm--What are you
talking about?

1066
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:06,788
- Come on, Gil. Knock it off.
- Gil, it's OK.

1067
01:02:06,865 --> 01:02:10,403
Look, we know you're sick,
and we want to help you.

1068
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,331
I'm sick? I'm not--What?

1069
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:15,361
- I told you not to bring it up.
- Bring what up, Charley?

1070
01:02:15,438 --> 01:02:17,741
I had to, man.
I mean, we're family.

1071
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:20,769
- But I don't...
- Gil, your disease, all right?

1072
01:02:20,846 --> 01:02:23,589
Your incurable,
untreatable brain disease.

1073
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:26,955
We know. Jesus. I mean,
how long are you gonna keep this up?

1074
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:29,833
What? I don't know what is going on.

1075
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:32,040
Look, so far we know
that it's hereditary...

1076
01:02:32,107 --> 01:02:35,338
it's progressive,
and asymptomatic so far...

1077
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:36,863
which is good news.

1078
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,424
OK, I didn't want to tell you
because I knew you'd be mad...

1079
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:40,930
but I had a plan--

1080
01:02:41,008 --> 01:02:43,106
Hereditary? Jesus, Charley!

1081
01:02:43,184 --> 01:02:47,078
What, are you Lucy?
What kind of crazy shit is this?

1082
01:02:47,144 --> 01:02:49,486
It's not crazy. You should've
seen her face when I told her.

1083
01:02:49,552 --> 01:02:50,694
She was so upset.

1084
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:53,801
Of course she was upset, Charley.
She's my oldest friend.

1085
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:57,549
She was upset because she thought
Max would inherit the brain...

1086
01:02:57,616 --> 01:03:00,130
- Wait a second.
- Max? How would Max inherit it?

1087
01:03:00,207 --> 01:03:01,664
Oh, you're good.
You're very good.

1088
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:03,467
Are you not sick?

1089
01:03:03,535 --> 01:03:04,579
I--

1090
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:06,596
Oh, Jesus. OK.

1091
01:03:06,672 --> 01:03:09,703
What the hell's going on here?

1092
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:12,108
Look, we know that Max
is Gil's son.

1093
01:03:12,175 --> 01:03:13,865
OK? You only have
to look to see that.

1094
01:03:13,932 --> 01:03:16,933
We know that you lied about
the sperm sample not working.

1095
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:18,496
But, you know,
best friends or not...

1096
01:03:18,573 --> 01:03:20,578
you wanted a kid
that you didn't have to share.

1097
01:03:20,655 --> 01:03:22,659
Oh, you miserable little faggot.

1098
01:03:22,736 --> 01:03:24,903
Oh, that's mature.
Homophobe much?

1099
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:27,359
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

1100
01:03:27,435 --> 01:03:32,078
And you lied to me?
About him being sick?

1101
01:03:32,144 --> 01:03:33,121
That's disgusting.

1102
01:03:33,198 --> 01:03:35,779
Jesus Christ, Gil.
Is that what you think?

1103
01:03:35,857 --> 01:03:37,515
No, no. I mean--

1104
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:38,895
I don't know. I mean...

1105
01:03:38,954 --> 01:03:42,434
It never occurred
to me before, Pam. It just--

1106
01:03:42,511 --> 01:03:44,718
Notice that they're not denying it.

1107
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:46,310
- I'll deny it.
- Fuck that.

1108
01:03:46,387 --> 01:03:48,581
- I gotta get out of here.
- You don't deserve it.

1109
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,510
So let's get a DNA test.

1110
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,515
You know what, motherfucker?
Get a court order.

1111
01:03:52,592 --> 01:03:54,528
In the meantime,
you stay the fuck away from us.

1112
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,923
It's me, OK? It's not you.

1113
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,205
They'll see that.
That's the way to go with this.

1114
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:07,399
Just blame me.
I'm fine with that.

1115
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:10,285
I mean, they didn't deny it.

1116
01:04:10,352 --> 01:04:11,811
Not really.

1117
01:04:15,629 --> 01:04:17,286
It's interesting. I...

1118
01:04:22,601 --> 01:04:23,915
OK?

1119
01:04:23,982 --> 01:04:25,707
Yeah. Just make sure
you don't get too much...

1120
01:04:25,774 --> 01:04:27,203
of the treatment room, all right?

1121
01:04:27,271 --> 01:04:28,998
'Cause that's what we've
got to fake later at your place.

1122
01:04:29,017 --> 01:04:30,474
So less is better with that.

1123
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,748
OK, OK. What if they catch me?

1124
01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:34,665
Are you the type people catch?

1125
01:04:34,733 --> 01:04:35,979
OK.

1126
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:41,543
Mis-en-scene.

1127
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:43,979
Don't forget--mis-en-scene.

1128
01:04:47,056 --> 01:04:48,293
Come in.

1129
01:04:55,371 --> 01:04:58,508
Do you want me to start
face up or face down?

1130
01:04:58,576 --> 01:05:01,028
Is this your first time here, Mamie?

1131
01:05:01,096 --> 01:05:02,852
- I said your name.
- That's all right.

1132
01:05:02,928 --> 01:05:04,482
You don't have to go
all the way out.

1133
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,990
Just start at the door.

1134
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:07,590
Can we take five, please?

1135
01:05:07,657 --> 01:05:09,221
Sure. Yeah.

1136
01:05:11,178 --> 01:05:13,096
Take five.

1137
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:16,010
Here.

1138
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,762
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1139
01:05:23,596 --> 01:05:24,708
Good?

1140
01:05:24,776 --> 01:05:26,311
Did you see my interviews?

1141
01:05:27,433 --> 01:05:31,146
- They were good, right?
- Yeah. A lot of acting.

1142
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:32,258
Thank you.

1143
01:05:32,334 --> 01:05:34,271
It's a documentary, you know.

1144
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:37,962
He loves it. He thinks
you're an American hero...

1145
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:40,995
making depressed women
everywhere feel good.

1146
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:42,482
He's an idiot.

1147
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:47,172
I think he's getting
a crush on you, you know?

1148
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:50,797
Right. Yeah, nothing says
"I love you" like blackmail.

1149
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,436
So, did you really have
a sister who died?

1150
01:06:00,972 --> 01:06:02,439
How do you know that?

1151
01:06:02,506 --> 01:06:04,808
From the interview
where you're walking.

1152
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,409
It's supposed to be Mexico.

1153
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:09,297
Oh, yeah. Well,
she was the baby, you know.

1154
01:06:09,354 --> 01:06:12,901
She was always sick.
But I have five others.

1155
01:06:12,978 --> 01:06:14,504
Oh, wow.

1156
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,106
I have a brother.

1157
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:18,350
Stepbrother.

1158
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:19,875
Not here.

1159
01:06:21,514 --> 01:06:22,924
So...

1160
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:26,023
you think we could match this
at my house?

1161
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,967
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

1162
01:06:29,043 --> 01:06:32,171
I'm gonna take the table home
and the screen.

1163
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,127
And the robe, so...

1164
01:06:34,195 --> 01:06:35,881
They're gonna be
looking at the girl anyway.

1165
01:06:35,948 --> 01:06:37,741
Yeah.

1166
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:40,016
Well, we have 45 minutes.

1167
01:06:41,645 --> 01:06:43,592
You want to help me rehearse?

1168
01:06:43,659 --> 01:06:45,357
Make me a better actor.

1169
01:06:46,863 --> 01:06:48,810
We should just get this done.

1170
01:06:50,287 --> 01:06:51,494
OK.

1171
01:07:03,629 --> 01:07:04,941
- Hi.
- Hey.

1172
01:07:05,008 --> 01:07:08,136
I just thought
Otis might be out here.

1173
01:07:08,211 --> 01:07:11,077
No, he's at Lane's.

1174
01:07:11,154 --> 01:07:13,831
I think he's probably
gonna spend the night.

1175
01:07:13,908 --> 01:07:17,381
Yeah. All right.

1176
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:19,020
Do you smoke?

1177
01:07:19,088 --> 01:07:20,937
Yeah. Pot?

1178
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:22,914
Yeah, I get high all the time.

1179
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:27,239
Thanks.

1180
01:07:43,246 --> 01:07:46,316
You know, the thing
about guys Otis' age is...

1181
01:07:46,383 --> 01:07:50,381
there's not a whole lot going on
in there besides hormones.

1182
01:07:50,448 --> 01:07:52,425
Yeah.

1183
01:07:54,926 --> 01:07:56,557
I think he's in love.

1184
01:07:56,625 --> 01:07:58,860
No way. So quick?

1185
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:02,993
It happened to me.

1186
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:06,705
How long did you and Otis
know each other...

1187
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:09,227
before you got together?

1188
01:08:11,798 --> 01:08:13,964
I'm not talking about Otis.

1189
01:09:02,224 --> 01:09:03,633
Look at me.

1190
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:09,802
Just look at me.

1191
01:10:09,399 --> 01:10:10,827
- I'm firing!
- You aim.

1192
01:10:10,903 --> 01:10:12,276
- No, I'm firing!
- I'm firing!

1193
01:10:12,343 --> 01:10:14,346
I'm firing! I told you I was firing.

1194
01:10:14,424 --> 01:10:17,836
- Look, see? Fire, fire, fire, fire!
- All right.

1195
01:10:31,255 --> 01:10:32,491
He's in love.

1196
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:41,910
Charley...

1197
01:10:41,978 --> 01:10:44,145
don't feed the dog
at the table.

1198
01:10:44,213 --> 01:10:45,459
Come on.

1199
01:10:51,154 --> 01:10:53,390
- Hi.
- Hi.

1200
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,635
I'm Shauna. You must be Mamie.

1201
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:57,293
Hi. Yes, that's right. Yeah.

1202
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,770
You're Javier's friend.

1203
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:00,525
He said 1:00, so...

1204
01:11:00,592 --> 01:11:02,061
Yeah, come in. That's right.

1205
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:03,664
You're right. You're right on time.

1206
01:11:03,729 --> 01:11:06,607
OK, so...

1207
01:11:06,672 --> 01:11:08,716
we're zoomed in
as much as possible right now...

1208
01:11:08,793 --> 01:11:10,827
and all we see is your face. OK?

1209
01:11:10,904 --> 01:11:14,164
When she arched her back
in rehearsal, we did see her nipples.

1210
01:11:14,231 --> 01:11:16,533
Nipples are fine.
Are nipples OK with you, Shauna?

1211
01:11:16,601 --> 01:11:18,989
Yeah, sure.
It's part of the story.

1212
01:11:19,063 --> 01:11:20,272
OK.

1213
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,162
OK, anyway, Javier...

1214
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:25,491
let's take it from you flipping
over onto your back.

1215
01:11:25,558 --> 01:11:27,599
Yeah, OK.

1216
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:29,009
Get the...

1217
01:11:31,542 --> 01:11:34,640
OK. And action.

1218
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,584
Can I get you
on your back now, Mrs. Kline?

1219
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:41,035
Do you think it's enough
with just her?

1220
01:11:41,113 --> 01:11:43,761
Oh, yeah. If you get more than one,
it dilutes it.

1221
01:11:43,826 --> 01:11:46,005
But if you want,
you could get testimonials...

1222
01:11:46,072 --> 01:11:47,529
you know,
clients who get it done?

1223
01:11:47,606 --> 01:11:49,993
Would you like
a complete massage, Mrs. Kline?

1224
01:11:50,071 --> 01:11:51,664
What do you mean by "complete"?

1225
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:53,160
Get ready for your zoom.

1226
01:11:53,236 --> 01:11:54,320
Right. Fuck.

1227
01:11:54,387 --> 01:11:56,152
It's all right.

1228
01:12:00,055 --> 01:12:01,811
There we go.

1229
01:12:11,324 --> 01:12:13,106
Oh, she's so good.

1230
01:12:13,174 --> 01:12:15,821
She's so good.

1231
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:17,651
And he's a natural.
Look at how he gives her...

1232
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:19,927
so much to work off of,
you know?

1233
01:12:40,086 --> 01:12:42,061
Are nipples OK with you, Shauna?

1234
01:12:42,138 --> 01:12:44,277
Yeah, sure.
It's part of the story.

1235
01:12:44,344 --> 01:12:47,058
Anyway, OK, OK. So...

1236
01:12:47,126 --> 01:12:49,513
so as soon as Javier says,
"Would you like a complete--"

1237
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:51,864
As do--as do I.

1238
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,456
And cut.

1239
01:12:53,532 --> 01:12:56,180
Shauna, fucking awesome.
I think I--

1240
01:12:57,752 --> 01:12:59,161
Oh! Shit.

1241
01:13:02,394 --> 01:13:04,245
It's gonna work, isn't it?

1242
01:13:04,311 --> 01:13:05,836
Yeah. Yeah, looks fine.

1243
01:13:07,189 --> 01:13:08,945
I was a house painter once.

1244
01:13:09,022 --> 01:13:10,028
Yeah?

1245
01:13:11,571 --> 01:13:13,616
A lot of alcoholics on that job.

1246
01:13:15,418 --> 01:13:16,942
The fumes.

1247
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,995
No kidding, man. You want one?

1248
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:20,721
Yeah, thank you.

1249
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:23,636
So, how'd you get these jobs,
you know?

1250
01:13:23,704 --> 01:13:25,746
Turn that thing off, OK?
You make me nervous.

1251
01:13:25,813 --> 01:13:27,062
Yeah.

1252
01:13:28,318 --> 01:13:29,528
- OK, it's off.
- Is it off?

1253
01:13:29,594 --> 01:13:31,088
Yeah, yeah, it's off.
There's no red light, right?

1254
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,500
There's no red light.
It's not recording.

1255
01:13:32,566 --> 01:13:34,676
Let me practice moves.

1256
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:38,196
Wasn't the worst job, but...

1257
01:13:38,263 --> 01:13:41,428
the damn ceilings?
I hate ceilings.

1258
01:13:41,495 --> 01:13:43,318
Nobody asked
for a green card, huh?

1259
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:45,292
Not for the crap jobs.

1260
01:13:45,369 --> 01:13:48,372
You stand at Home Depot,
nobody asks you anything. Right?

1261
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:49,388
Yeah.

1262
01:13:49,464 --> 01:13:50,990
But for Lifewell
and Beverly Patrol...

1263
01:13:51,067 --> 01:13:52,686
you had to have a green card.

1264
01:13:52,763 --> 01:13:53,876
How?

1265
01:13:53,943 --> 01:13:56,695
I got married.

1266
01:13:56,762 --> 01:13:59,094
I was seeing this girl
off and on...

1267
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,299
so she said she'd marry me.

1268
01:14:01,367 --> 01:14:03,189
It wasn't free.
I'm still paying her.

1269
01:14:03,256 --> 01:14:06,574
Wow! Hey, you think we could get her
for the documentary?

1270
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,588
No way! You kidding me?

1271
01:14:08,664 --> 01:14:10,353
It's against the law. It's major.

1272
01:14:10,431 --> 01:14:12,982
We had to pretend for a year
we was married.

1273
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:15,542
They came over,
they'd do interviews...

1274
01:14:15,608 --> 01:14:17,949
ask us questions
in different rooms.

1275
01:14:18,007 --> 01:14:20,347
She was real good.
Good actress, you know?

1276
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:23,703
But nobody knows.
I mean nobody. Not even Mamie.

1277
01:14:23,771 --> 01:14:25,019
Nicky!

1278
01:14:28,086 --> 01:14:29,649
Nicky!

1279
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:38,396
Hi.

1280
01:14:38,453 --> 01:14:42,233
So what if I hadn't seen it?
Were you gonna tell me?

1281
01:14:42,301 --> 01:14:44,149
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1282
01:14:44,217 --> 01:14:46,194
I saw the tape, Nicky. OK?

1283
01:14:46,269 --> 01:14:47,891
Javi and his wife.

1284
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:50,413
Isn't that what you wanted,
to rub my face in it?

1285
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:52,245
Like this isn't enough humiliation.

1286
01:14:52,311 --> 01:14:54,327
Don't be mad at me.
Be mad at him!

1287
01:14:54,393 --> 01:14:55,987
I care, at least.

1288
01:14:56,061 --> 01:14:59,025
Oh, yeah, you care. Yeah.
You're 100% heart.

1289
01:14:59,102 --> 01:15:00,790
Business is business, OK?

1290
01:15:00,857 --> 01:15:02,450
Come on. I'm not a prick!

1291
01:15:02,526 --> 01:15:03,602
Oh, yeah?

1292
01:15:03,678 --> 01:15:08,116
Yes. Hey, I'll--
Wait. I'll prove it.

1293
01:15:14,592 --> 01:15:17,209
- You remember this?
- What?

1294
01:15:17,276 --> 01:15:19,321
You left it for the baby.

1295
01:15:19,386 --> 01:15:22,235
Come on,
I want you to have this, OK?

1296
01:15:23,387 --> 01:15:25,391
As a sign...

1297
01:15:25,468 --> 01:15:28,766
that I am not gonna screw you.

1298
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,387
OK?

1299
01:15:33,984 --> 01:15:35,643
That's who I am.

1300
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:38,011
And as for him, he's, you know...

1301
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:41,523
I don't want to judge or anything,
but he's a sex worker.

1302
01:15:41,599 --> 01:15:44,599
He's a liar...sort of.

1303
01:15:46,076 --> 01:15:47,420
He's not ideal.

1304
01:15:50,336 --> 01:15:51,736
Jesus, Nicky.

1305
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:57,269
You know that's a guy's cross.

1306
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:59,897
Yeah, the father gave it to me.

1307
01:16:11,003 --> 01:16:13,717
I'm sorry.

1308
01:16:13,784 --> 01:16:15,252
Just don't do it again.

1309
01:16:17,728 --> 01:16:20,537
Kind of thought
we had a moment here, you know?

1310
01:16:20,602 --> 01:16:23,260
Based on you coming to me
first with this...

1311
01:16:23,327 --> 01:16:25,849
instead of Javier.

1312
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:29,752
Do you want to put
some pants on?

1313
01:16:31,969 --> 01:16:33,340
Sorry.

1314
01:16:33,408 --> 01:16:35,640
- Morning.
- Yeah.

1315
01:16:37,089 --> 01:16:38,644
Morning.

1316
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,025
Look, I want to see her...

1317
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:46,202
so do you know where she lives?

1318
01:16:50,171 --> 01:16:52,666
- Oh, look.
- Is that Mrs. Kline?

1319
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:54,738
Shauna. I knew it.

1320
01:16:56,769 --> 01:16:59,003
You know, now he's making
a fool out of me.

1321
01:16:59,071 --> 01:17:01,556
Fuck. He's fired. He's fired.

1322
01:17:01,633 --> 01:17:04,001
OK, and are you gonna
give me my son's name?

1323
01:17:04,058 --> 01:17:06,649
No. So let's just pretend
we never saw it.

1324
01:17:06,716 --> 01:17:07,760
What?

1325
01:17:07,838 --> 01:17:09,842
He will tell me
when he's ready, OK?

1326
01:17:09,918 --> 01:17:12,057
It's OK. Let's just leave it all alone.

1327
01:17:12,124 --> 01:17:13,687
Whatever. Fine, fine. Whatever.

1328
01:17:15,165 --> 01:17:18,099
It is so hard to keep your ideals
in this business.

1329
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:28,217
You know, I got a great idea.

1330
01:17:28,283 --> 01:17:30,147
- What?
- I got a great idea.

1331
01:17:30,204 --> 01:17:31,353
What?

1332
01:17:31,421 --> 01:17:34,134
We go down to Mississippi,
and we get some barbecue.

1333
01:17:34,201 --> 01:17:36,543
And then we'll go
to the Indian casinos.

1334
01:17:36,609 --> 01:17:38,134
Have you ever been
to one of them?

1335
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:40,570
- In a private airplane?
- Exactly.

1336
01:17:40,637 --> 01:17:43,160
Baby, you didn't tell me
you had a private airplane.

1337
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:44,992
I'll go anywhere with you.

1338
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:52,224
Just sign there
and note date of birth.

1339
01:17:54,755 --> 01:17:57,057
OK, everybody,
let's give it up for Steve.

1340
01:17:57,123 --> 01:17:58,294
Scott. I'm sorry.

1341
01:17:58,371 --> 01:18:02,140
He'll be doing
<i>She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain</i>.

1342
01:19:39,781 --> 01:19:41,154
Yes.

1343
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:43,255
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1344
01:20:09,024 --> 01:20:10,933
Bacon!

1345
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,573
Cool.

1346
01:20:13,694 --> 01:20:17,493
Look, I know you're angry
with the legal stuff.

1347
01:20:17,571 --> 01:20:21,185
I can stop it with a phone call.
That's what I want.

1348
01:20:21,253 --> 01:20:23,102
I hope you want to, too.

1349
01:20:26,335 --> 01:20:29,058
Oh, man.
This isn't a counter-suit.

1350
01:20:29,126 --> 01:20:31,870
We weren't honest with you.
You were right.

1351
01:20:31,935 --> 01:20:35,552
We didn't destroy all of your sperm
two years ago.

1352
01:20:35,618 --> 01:20:38,140
Oh, my God. I knew it.

1353
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:44,126
The top sheet's
from the fertility center.

1354
01:20:44,194 --> 01:20:46,053
See, it's a log there...

1355
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:49,726
and at the top, you can see where
you deposited three years ago...

1356
01:20:49,793 --> 01:20:52,546
and then at the bottom
where we withdrew it last week.

1357
01:20:54,147 --> 01:20:55,874
Wait, last week?

1358
01:20:57,446 --> 01:21:00,613
This is from a DNA lab.
We were gonna use this one.

1359
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,393
Well, we heard
it was the best, so...

1360
01:21:03,461 --> 01:21:06,970
we went there using your sperm
and a DNA sample from Max.

1361
01:21:07,047 --> 01:21:08,535
Basically, we beat you to it.

1362
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,925
What does it say?

1363
01:21:09,993 --> 01:21:12,637
- Charley...
- Let me see that.

1364
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,048
OK, we want
an independent assessment.

1365
01:21:18,113 --> 01:21:20,503
- No, we don't.
- So do we.

1366
01:21:20,581 --> 01:21:22,555
I think it's important
you're convinced.

1367
01:21:22,632 --> 01:21:26,756
So you can have access to Max
to get a sample.

1368
01:21:26,823 --> 01:21:28,962
That's gonna be the last time
you'll see him.

1369
01:21:29,029 --> 01:21:31,196
We're asking
for a restraining order.

1370
01:21:31,263 --> 01:21:33,825
Our lawyer doesn't think
it's gonna be much of a problem.

1371
01:21:33,892 --> 01:21:36,317
Please, I don't want another test.

1372
01:21:36,385 --> 01:21:38,687
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

1373
01:21:38,754 --> 01:21:41,660
It was wrong,
really wrong to do that.

1374
01:21:41,736 --> 01:21:43,262
No, no, it was me.

1375
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:45,985
OK? Take a restraining order
on me, not him.

1376
01:21:46,053 --> 01:21:47,395
I'll sign anything.

1377
01:21:47,461 --> 01:21:49,399
No, you were right. We did lie.

1378
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,204
About keeping extra sperm?
That's fine. Who cares?

1379
01:21:54,282 --> 01:21:56,734
No, we lied about...

1380
01:21:56,802 --> 01:21:59,623
why we stopped wanting
to get pregnant with you, Gil.

1381
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:03,201
We just--we didn't want
our child to be his...

1382
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:04,793
and we didn't know
how to tell him.

1383
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:06,490
Because of me, right?

1384
01:22:06,566 --> 01:22:09,117
I know you guys have never
liked me, and that's fine.

1385
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:11,842
Oh, no, Charley...

1386
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,540
it's because we do like you.

1387
01:22:13,608 --> 01:22:15,198
Look, it doesn't matter why.

1388
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:18,056
It was because of the affair.

1389
01:22:22,086 --> 01:22:23,647
What?

1390
01:22:25,929 --> 01:22:27,483
Gil...

1391
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:36,931
OK, you have to tell him.

1392
01:22:38,465 --> 01:22:42,013
Gil was having an affair and...

1393
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:45,284
he told me he was leaving you.

1394
01:22:45,351 --> 01:22:50,780
And I said whatever you say
when you hear that, you know?

1395
01:22:50,857 --> 01:22:53,063
"Think it over. Slow down."

1396
01:22:55,114 --> 01:22:57,187
But he was--You were really--

1397
01:22:57,254 --> 01:22:59,678
You remember
how you were, Gil? So sure?

1398
01:23:01,578 --> 01:23:03,744
And you know what?
I suddenly thought...

1399
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,635
I don't want those genes
in my baby.

1400
01:23:05,703 --> 01:23:08,090
You know? I don't want a series
of Daddy's boyfriends...

1401
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:09,788
coming in and out of his life.

1402
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:13,031
But I couldn't tell you that, so...

1403
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:18,180
Anyway, you were...

1404
01:23:18,247 --> 01:23:20,453
more invested in the guy
you were seeing...

1405
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,826
than having this baby...

1406
01:23:21,892 --> 01:23:24,864
so we just told you it wasn't working
and we went to the bank.

1407
01:23:24,931 --> 01:23:27,321
It was a really hard decision.

1408
01:23:27,398 --> 01:23:31,656
And I felt guilty for a long time.
But there it is.

1409
01:23:31,723 --> 01:23:33,247
I'm sorry.

1410
01:23:38,886 --> 01:23:40,612
What guy?

1411
01:23:44,804 --> 01:23:47,459
He doesn't live here anymore.

1412
01:23:47,526 --> 01:23:50,491
He moved away.
You--you never met him.

1413
01:23:50,568 --> 01:23:52,293
OK, what, you broke it off?

1414
01:23:56,168 --> 01:23:58,057
It just ended, that's all.

1415
01:24:00,485 --> 01:24:02,210
That's the whole truth.

1416
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:06,142
'Cause you were so interested.

1417
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:09,279
All right? So our lawyer's name
is Jean Douglas.

1418
01:24:09,355 --> 01:24:11,773
And she knows Steve...

1419
01:24:11,849 --> 01:24:13,987
so I'm sure they can make
all the arrangements for your test.

1420
01:24:14,055 --> 01:24:15,963
Please, I don't want another test.

1421
01:24:16,041 --> 01:24:18,975
Restraining order's gonna be in place
in a couple of weeks, so...

1422
01:24:19,053 --> 01:24:20,930
if you want to get another test,
you have to hurry.

1423
01:24:23,339 --> 01:24:25,959
- I guess that's it, huh?
- Yeah, we should go.

1424
01:24:32,172 --> 01:24:33,764
I am so sorry.

1425
01:24:48,841 --> 01:24:51,525
I didn't tell you
because it didn't mean anything.

1426
01:24:51,591 --> 01:24:53,798
It was...

1427
01:24:53,866 --> 01:24:56,071
crazy, intense. I...

1428
01:24:58,152 --> 01:25:00,703
I didn't think
it would help to tell you.

1429
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:07,399
I...

1430
01:25:07,466 --> 01:25:10,246
I wasn't born this way,
you know--

1431
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:11,838
sterile.

1432
01:25:13,671 --> 01:25:16,260
I had a vasectomy when I was 21...

1433
01:25:16,327 --> 01:25:18,754
which was as soon
as they'd let me.

1434
01:25:20,393 --> 01:25:23,942
I got a girl pregnant
when I was a teenager...

1435
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:27,145
and I thought it would make me
feel better about it.

1436
01:25:30,884 --> 01:25:33,733
OK. I don't know
why you're telling me this.

1437
01:25:35,853 --> 01:25:37,676
You know, just saying that...

1438
01:25:37,743 --> 01:25:39,776
that was a lie, too.

1439
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:43,201
Just seeing if it makes us even.

1440
01:25:54,604 --> 01:25:56,099
I've got to get to work.

1441
01:26:03,339 --> 01:26:04,865
Oh, shit.

1442
01:26:04,942 --> 01:26:06,083
What?

1443
01:26:07,464 --> 01:26:10,878
- I'm fucking pregnant.
- Nice move!

1444
01:26:10,956 --> 01:26:12,864
It wasn't intentional.

1445
01:26:12,941 --> 01:26:14,504
Yeah, but this is great.

1446
01:26:14,571 --> 01:26:17,572
Even if he makes you sign a pre-nup,
this baby's your ticket.

1447
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:19,337
Yeah, I--

1448
01:26:19,405 --> 01:26:22,052
I'm not sure
if it's Otis' or Frank's.

1449
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:24,641
Wait a minute.
You slept with the fairy?

1450
01:26:24,716 --> 01:26:27,567
Yeah, the first day.

1451
01:26:27,624 --> 01:26:29,004
Dude, how stupid are you?

1452
01:26:29,072 --> 01:26:31,816
You screwed a gay guy
without a condom?

1453
01:26:31,882 --> 01:26:34,118
He was a virgin.

1454
01:26:34,184 --> 01:26:37,598
Yeah. Right! Me, too.

1455
01:26:37,676 --> 01:26:39,783
Come on.
I still don't see the problem.

1456
01:26:39,851 --> 01:26:42,537
In a month--in a month,
you tell the old guy it's his...

1457
01:26:42,603 --> 01:26:46,219
and then when you deliver,
it's like this really big preemie...

1458
01:26:46,287 --> 01:26:48,742
that just happens
to look like both of them.

1459
01:26:48,809 --> 01:26:51,178
We're not reinventing
the wheel here.

1460
01:26:55,504 --> 01:26:58,371
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

1461
01:26:58,449 --> 01:26:59,562
Big day, huh?

1462
01:26:59,628 --> 01:27:02,245
- Yeah. We're almost ready.
- What's he doing in there?

1463
01:27:02,313 --> 01:27:04,519
He's setting up, like,
a screening room or something.

1464
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:05,796
He was here all day editing.

1465
01:27:05,871 --> 01:27:07,492
He wanted his director's cut
or something.

1466
01:27:07,569 --> 01:27:10,025
- It's all set.
- OK. Great. Good.

1467
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:13,285
Show time.

1468
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:22,634
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1469
01:27:22,702 --> 01:27:23,681
Ready?

1470
01:27:25,004 --> 01:27:26,251
Yeah.

1471
01:27:32,138 --> 01:27:34,826
<i>Happy Endings</i>.
Great idea, baby.

1472
01:27:34,894 --> 01:27:36,619
Thank you.

1473
01:27:41,137 --> 01:27:44,905
In June of 2002,
Javier Duran returned to Mexico...

1474
01:27:44,972 --> 01:27:47,111
to the town he left
five years before.

1475
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:50,182
Coming back here to San Juanito
is strange.

1476
01:27:50,258 --> 01:27:51,685
Over there is my house.

1477
01:27:51,751 --> 01:27:54,631
Don't film it!
They don't want it.

1478
01:27:54,697 --> 01:27:56,643
And my school.

1479
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,476
I haven't been back here
in five years.

1480
01:27:58,543 --> 01:28:02,216
I can't believe you shot this
across from the Costco. It's wild!

1481
01:28:02,284 --> 01:28:03,714
This is the bookend
to the movie. OK?

1482
01:28:03,788 --> 01:28:05,162
At the end of the film,
he walks towards camera.

1483
01:28:05,227 --> 01:28:07,174
We don't follow him.
It's all in suggestion.

1484
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:08,460
You'll see.

1485
01:28:08,526 --> 01:28:10,089
And I got this little girl--
this little Mexican girl--

1486
01:28:10,157 --> 01:28:11,787
to shout out, "Javier! Javier!"
like this--

1487
01:28:11,855 --> 01:28:13,036
I shouldn't have told you.

1488
01:28:13,102 --> 01:28:15,049
This is that improvised part.

1489
01:28:15,115 --> 01:28:16,459
- Remember, Nicky?
- Yeah!

1490
01:28:16,525 --> 01:28:19,490
This is my speech where you see
that I have a heart, you know?

1491
01:28:19,567 --> 01:28:20,650
It's not just the money.

1492
01:28:20,717 --> 01:28:21,896
Oh, I didn't see this.

1493
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:23,662
Wanting to do this
for my clients.

1494
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:25,417
They taught us at school...

1495
01:28:25,484 --> 01:28:29,414
how to handle a client
who wants a full release.

1496
01:28:29,482 --> 01:28:32,234
Polite, but no, thanks.

1497
01:28:33,385 --> 01:28:36,261
The first time, I say, "No"...

1498
01:28:36,329 --> 01:28:38,701
and the woman--she cried.

1499
01:28:38,766 --> 01:28:40,195
Shame.

1500
01:28:40,271 --> 01:28:42,440
And I felt bad.

1501
01:28:42,507 --> 01:28:46,852
And so, the next time it happened,
I thought, "Who am I to say no?

1502
01:28:46,928 --> 01:28:50,409
"This is America.
There's no church here.

1503
01:28:50,475 --> 01:28:52,847
"There's only the body
and its dreams."

1504
01:28:52,914 --> 01:28:55,762
His words. His words.
I didn't tell him.

1505
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:58,476
"The body and its dreams."
It's genius, man.

1506
01:28:58,542 --> 01:28:59,818
Yeah.

1507
01:28:59,885 --> 01:29:01,833
And you can tell
by looking at these women...

1508
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,530
what those dream are.

1509
01:29:03,596 --> 01:29:06,252
Their lives are so ordinary.

1510
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,458
Not good. Not bad.

1511
01:29:08,526 --> 01:29:09,936
Medium.

1512
01:29:10,003 --> 01:29:11,855
They want something more.

1513
01:29:11,921 --> 01:29:15,182
You know, not just a touch.

1514
01:29:15,248 --> 01:29:17,388
A secret.

1515
01:29:17,455 --> 01:29:20,592
A secret that makes them
feel shame.

1516
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:23,113
This is good for them.

1517
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:27,755
It makes them somebody
other than what people see.

1518
01:29:27,823 --> 01:29:31,275
And that is why I do it.

1519
01:29:31,343 --> 01:29:33,577
And the tips are good.

1520
01:29:33,644 --> 01:29:35,534
Makes you like me, right?

1521
01:29:35,601 --> 01:29:37,538
Because, you know,
I'm helping them.

1522
01:29:37,614 --> 01:29:38,698
Maybe. I don't know.

1523
01:29:38,766 --> 01:29:41,220
Where's that part--
Oh, here.

1524
01:29:43,723 --> 01:29:46,630
To his clients, Javier is a god.

1525
01:29:46,707 --> 01:29:50,149
Strong. All-knowing.
Dangerous but safe.

1526
01:29:50,227 --> 01:29:53,353
But in his own life as an immigrant
in this country...

1527
01:29:53,419 --> 01:29:56,623
all the power
is in someone else's hands.

1528
01:29:56,689 --> 01:29:58,350
- <i>La Migra</i>!
- <i>La Migra</i>!

1529
01:29:59,403 --> 01:30:01,611
- Watch out!
- <i>La Migra</i>!

1530
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,269
Come here. Hey!

1531
01:30:03,346 --> 01:30:04,757
Come right here.
Do you speak English?

1532
01:30:04,814 --> 01:30:06,702
- What is this?
- Nicky--

1533
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:07,978
This is good. Don't worry.

1534
01:30:08,046 --> 01:30:11,115
...is a battle against <i>La Migra</i>.

1535
01:30:11,183 --> 01:30:14,347
And the only answer
<i>La Migra</i> understands...

1536
01:30:14,414 --> 01:30:15,527
is this...

1537
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:18,566
Yeah, I have to
have a green card.

1538
01:30:18,642 --> 01:30:19,620
What the fuck?

1539
01:30:19,698 --> 01:30:21,156
I got married.

1540
01:30:21,231 --> 01:30:23,506
I was seeing this girl off and on...

1541
01:30:23,574 --> 01:30:25,836
and so, she said she'd marry me.

1542
01:30:25,903 --> 01:30:27,312
I was afraid. I'm still paying her.

1543
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,615
Nicky, what the fuck is this?

1544
01:30:29,682 --> 01:30:32,012
See, we're just
raising the stakes.

1545
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,151
It's a drama thing, you know.

1546
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:35,409
It's fine. Just...

1547
01:30:38,707 --> 01:30:40,616
It's good, right?

1548
01:30:40,692 --> 01:30:41,670
I don't--

1549
01:30:41,746 --> 01:30:43,821
We dated, and he was great.

1550
01:30:43,886 --> 01:30:47,118
And so he asked me.

1551
01:30:47,185 --> 01:30:49,737
What did I care?
I'd been married before.

1552
01:30:49,814 --> 01:30:53,324
It didn't mean that much to me.
And the money was good.

1553
01:30:53,391 --> 01:30:55,758
- What the fuck?
- Jesus, Nicky!

1554
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:57,610
It was supposed to be
for two years...

1555
01:30:57,677 --> 01:31:00,909
until he got
his green card, but...

1556
01:31:00,976 --> 01:31:02,770
it works, you know?

1557
01:31:02,836 --> 01:31:06,318
I mean, it's not like
we have to be faithful.

1558
01:31:06,386 --> 01:31:09,454
You know? But it's better
than my last husband...

1559
01:31:09,521 --> 01:31:10,950
or the guys after him.

1560
01:31:11,026 --> 01:31:14,539
It's...it's private...

1561
01:31:14,614 --> 01:31:16,579
and we don't even really
know each other...

1562
01:31:16,657 --> 01:31:17,808
which is the best thing.

1563
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:21,424
I mean, I had to know, like,
what color his toothbrush is...

1564
01:31:21,491 --> 01:31:25,960
or what side of the bed he slept on
for the interview, but...

1565
01:31:26,037 --> 01:31:31,367
other than that,
Javi's a real mystery.

1566
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,067
And I am, too.

1567
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:37,286
And it's a big fuck you
to everyone, too.

1568
01:31:37,363 --> 01:31:39,338
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1569
01:31:39,414 --> 01:31:41,900
- Are you crazy?
- The story unfolded--

1570
01:31:41,967 --> 01:31:44,172
Are you crazy?
I admitted to a federal crime!

1571
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:46,254
If people see this,
do you know what happens to me?

1572
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,140
When did you see her?
When did you even go there?

1573
01:31:49,207 --> 01:31:50,695
- You know about this?
- She didn't know.

1574
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:53,591
- OK. I knew--I did know about--
- They will deport me!

1575
01:31:53,647 --> 01:31:54,828
They'll send Shauna to prison...

1576
01:31:54,894 --> 01:31:56,622
and they'll send me back
to that shit hole!

1577
01:31:56,690 --> 01:31:57,743
No, no, no, no.
Look, look, look. It's cool.

1578
01:31:57,811 --> 01:31:59,153
I got her to sign
a piece of paper...

1579
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:02,962
that says everything
she's about to say is a lie, so, it's--

1580
01:32:03,028 --> 01:32:04,965
Javi, that's too much. It's OK.

1581
01:32:05,043 --> 01:32:06,030
We--It--

1582
01:32:06,097 --> 01:32:08,370
- No.
- Oh, God!

1583
01:32:08,437 --> 01:32:09,615
Fuck!

1584
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:15,400
Javi, OK. It's OK.

1585
01:32:15,475 --> 01:32:17,749
- Is there any more?
- I'm not mad.

1586
01:32:17,817 --> 01:32:19,407
- Any more?
- No, no, no.

1587
01:32:19,474 --> 01:32:20,426
Are there any more?!

1588
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:21,452
In the camera.
There's one in the camera.

1589
01:32:21,528 --> 01:32:22,603
OK.

1590
01:32:24,855 --> 01:32:27,158
Just so you know--
just so you know!

1591
01:32:27,216 --> 01:32:29,737
Nobody pays me to get off.
Nobody!

1592
01:32:29,815 --> 01:32:31,339
If I do it, I do it for fun.

1593
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:34,447
We only make believe so that
you give her the name of her kid.

1594
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:37,716
And this--this is mine!

1595
01:32:37,784 --> 01:32:39,790
We stole the real one
from your room.

1596
01:32:39,856 --> 01:32:41,939
That's what we were doing there.

1597
01:32:42,004 --> 01:32:43,730
Right, Mamie?

1598
01:32:43,798 --> 01:32:46,060
- Right, Mamie?!
- Yes.

1599
01:32:52,658 --> 01:32:54,154
Why did you do that?

1600
01:32:54,232 --> 01:32:56,304
Why did you put that stuff in?! Why?!

1601
01:32:56,372 --> 01:32:57,685
I thought you should know!

1602
01:32:57,752 --> 01:32:59,470
Know with what? I knew that!

1603
01:32:59,544 --> 01:33:01,328
I knew what kind of guy he is, OK?

1604
01:33:01,396 --> 01:33:02,988
You took me there. I saw her.

1605
01:33:03,065 --> 01:33:06,355
Not him. You. Who you are.
Who you are.

1606
01:33:06,422 --> 01:33:08,839
You're one of those women
who likes their secrets!

1607
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,285
That's you!

1608
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:13,970
OK. Just tell--All right.
It's nobody's fault, OK?

1609
01:33:14,038 --> 01:33:16,492
That's--It's OK. Just tell me
everything you know.

1610
01:33:16,569 --> 01:33:18,450
'Cause we had an agreement.
We had an agreement.

1611
01:33:18,516 --> 01:33:20,404
Oh, OK. So, where's my movie?
Where's my movie?

1612
01:33:20,472 --> 01:33:21,583
That's not my fault.

1613
01:33:21,651 --> 01:33:22,698
- What did I--
- No, I didn't--

1614
01:33:22,774 --> 01:33:25,229
What did I get? You loved this.

1615
01:33:25,307 --> 01:33:26,927
You know you did.
You loved this!

1616
01:33:26,995 --> 01:33:29,968
- You blackmailed me!
- You loved every second of it!

1617
01:33:30,035 --> 01:33:32,212
You went to sleep
every night saying...

1618
01:33:32,278 --> 01:33:34,551
"I'm making a movie for a guy
who's got a gun to my head.

1619
01:33:34,618 --> 01:33:35,664
"I'm alive!"

1620
01:33:35,732 --> 01:33:36,747
- No.
- Yes!

1621
01:33:36,823 --> 01:33:37,801
- No.
- Yes!

1622
01:33:37,879 --> 01:33:40,269
And it's better than
fucking some Mexican...

1623
01:33:40,344 --> 01:33:41,936
you won't even tell anybody
you're seeing.

1624
01:33:42,003 --> 01:33:44,785
You know, you probably loved
giving up that kid.

1625
01:33:44,853 --> 01:33:47,346
You--you--
It's like, hey, look!

1626
01:33:47,414 --> 01:33:49,619
I'm not just some ordinary woman.

1627
01:33:49,685 --> 01:33:51,660
I've got a kid somewhere
I gave up. I'm a star.

1628
01:33:51,738 --> 01:33:54,155
- That's the movie you're--
- Stop it! Stop!

1629
01:33:54,231 --> 01:33:59,181
Stop. Just tell me his name.
Just tell me his name.

1630
01:33:59,257 --> 01:34:02,287
You made a fool out of me,
letting me give you that cross!

1631
01:34:02,355 --> 01:34:03,735
- OK, I'm sorry.
- So fuck you!

1632
01:34:03,802 --> 01:34:05,518
- You can tell me--
- Fuck AFI!

1633
01:34:05,585 --> 01:34:08,243
- You can tell me his name!
- No, I can't.

1634
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,037
Yes, you can.

1635
01:34:14,745 --> 01:34:17,011
What do you think,
you know me?

1636
01:34:17,077 --> 01:34:20,308
You don't know me!
Nobody knows me!

1637
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:32,938
Hey, have you seen
the keys to the Spyder?

1638
01:34:34,262 --> 01:34:38,195
Don't worry.
I'm not on the pink slip.

1639
01:34:38,262 --> 01:34:41,493
- How was your lab test?
- Fine.

1640
01:34:43,029 --> 01:34:45,550
What's wrong? Boy trouble?

1641
01:34:45,628 --> 01:34:47,277
Fuck you, Jude.

1642
01:34:50,711 --> 01:34:53,684
I'm signing a pre-nup, OK?

1643
01:34:53,751 --> 01:34:55,639
So don't look at me like that.

1644
01:34:58,076 --> 01:35:01,519
What? Nothing comes off the money
you're gonna get 30 years from now...

1645
01:35:01,596 --> 01:35:04,012
when your dad dies
from too much sex.

1646
01:35:07,515 --> 01:35:09,776
You don't have
to call me Mom...

1647
01:35:09,843 --> 01:35:11,569
all the time.

1648
01:35:11,636 --> 01:35:14,025
Otis.

1649
01:35:16,213 --> 01:35:19,001
Hey, baby. You look great.
I'm making some eggs.

1650
01:35:19,059 --> 01:35:20,758
No, I gotta go.

1651
01:35:23,415 --> 01:35:24,689
- Coffee?
- I can't.

1652
01:35:24,756 --> 01:35:27,031
I got a crazy day.

1653
01:35:27,098 --> 01:35:28,526
OK.

1654
01:35:28,603 --> 01:35:31,701
Lane says she's on for lunch.
Pick her up at her place.

1655
01:35:58,488 --> 01:36:01,077
Just give me a minute, OK?

1656
01:36:12,153 --> 01:36:14,389
That's OK.
You can leave it open.

1657
01:36:14,456 --> 01:36:15,703
Yeah?

1658
01:36:18,495 --> 01:36:22,712
I don't even know why I'm here.
I have already made up my mind.

1659
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:24,372
It's just something we do here...

1660
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,329
Jude. Or is it Judy?

1661
01:36:26,395 --> 01:36:28,218
- Jude.
- OK.

1662
01:36:32,121 --> 01:36:33,532
I want the abortion.

1663
01:36:33,589 --> 01:36:35,356
Do you want to tell me why?

1664
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:38,384
Well, I'm marrying somebody...

1665
01:36:38,461 --> 01:36:39,890
and...

1666
01:36:42,393 --> 01:36:44,628
I want to start out
with a clean slate.

1667
01:36:46,075 --> 01:36:48,820
- This is not his child?
- It probably is.

1668
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:55,447
If it isn't, it's his son's.

1669
01:36:59,455 --> 01:37:01,046
Are you serious?

1670
01:37:01,113 --> 01:37:04,212
Yeah, and then,
if we have more kids...

1671
01:37:04,279 --> 01:37:09,688
their brother or sister
could be their cousin or...

1672
01:37:09,754 --> 01:37:13,467
- You see how it could get?
- Yeah.

1673
01:37:14,715 --> 01:37:16,718
Do your partners know
of your pregnancy?

1674
01:37:16,795 --> 01:37:17,745
No.

1675
01:37:19,193 --> 01:37:22,043
Do you have any feelings
about your baby?

1676
01:37:22,108 --> 01:37:23,604
You're not supposed
to say "baby".

1677
01:37:23,672 --> 01:37:25,687
You're supposed to say
"pregnancy" or "fetus".

1678
01:37:25,751 --> 01:37:27,029
I'm pretty sure about that.

1679
01:37:27,097 --> 01:37:30,327
It's important to you
not to call it a baby.

1680
01:37:30,395 --> 01:37:33,715
Mm-hmm. But that's because
you're gonna rip it out of me...

1681
01:37:33,791 --> 01:37:35,342
and flush it away.

1682
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:37,693
Are you pro-life?

1683
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,090
Will you sign my form?

1684
01:37:40,157 --> 01:37:43,122
I'm just asking questions.

1685
01:37:43,197 --> 01:37:45,528
I'm pro-choice, of course.

1686
01:37:45,596 --> 01:37:47,666
But my opinions
aren't important here.

1687
01:37:47,744 --> 01:37:50,007
Well, then, I'd shut up about them.

1688
01:37:51,417 --> 01:37:52,885
I think we're done.

1689
01:37:52,953 --> 01:37:55,033
I have an appointment
for tomorrow at 10:00.

1690
01:37:56,895 --> 01:37:59,704
I don't want you
to misunderstand.

1691
01:37:59,771 --> 01:38:04,145
I think everything is a much bigger
decision than we think.

1692
01:38:04,222 --> 01:38:06,608
And this one--
this is the biggest.

1693
01:38:16,544 --> 01:38:19,479
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I don't even know what to ask you.

1694
01:38:19,546 --> 01:38:21,934
You're a little fucked up,
aren't you?

1695
01:38:23,517 --> 01:38:25,244
You gotta be better at this
most days.

1696
01:38:27,775 --> 01:38:29,808
This is about average.

1697
01:38:31,930 --> 01:38:34,834
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1698
01:38:34,911 --> 01:38:36,916
I'm not pro-life, though.

1699
01:38:36,993 --> 01:38:39,985
Who is, once you start
paying attention?

1700
01:38:57,726 --> 01:38:59,252
Oh, hey, babe.

1701
01:39:01,219 --> 01:39:03,069
I didn't see you.

1702
01:39:03,135 --> 01:39:04,757
Where were you this afternoon?

1703
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:06,972
Oh, I called your cell phone.

1704
01:39:08,642 --> 01:39:12,602
Lane--her mom came to town,
so we took her to the beach.

1705
01:39:12,669 --> 01:39:14,779
Without Otis?

1706
01:39:14,846 --> 01:39:17,849
Didn't she want to introduce
her boyfriend to her mother?

1707
01:39:19,008 --> 01:39:21,657
I don't know. I stay out of it.

1708
01:39:21,723 --> 01:39:23,632
You do, huh?

1709
01:39:23,709 --> 01:39:25,980
I thought we were
gonna eat out later.

1710
01:39:26,047 --> 01:39:27,832
Oh, shit. Right.

1711
01:39:29,117 --> 01:39:31,227
Yeah. I got
a physical tomorrow...

1712
01:39:31,293 --> 01:39:32,885
so I gotta do
all the blood work...

1713
01:39:32,962 --> 01:39:36,434
and I can't eat anything
until after 7:00--

1714
01:39:36,511 --> 01:39:38,334
or before 7:00.

1715
01:39:38,401 --> 01:39:41,661
I'm gonna go sit out
by the pool, so...

1716
01:39:41,728 --> 01:39:42,745
come on.

1717
01:39:45,087 --> 01:39:46,399
I told him everything.

1718
01:39:46,467 --> 01:39:48,317
Otis, I said I'd handle this.

1719
01:39:48,385 --> 01:39:50,006
You'll take her back.
I know you will.

1720
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:52,020
What's going on?

1721
01:39:52,097 --> 01:39:54,581
He knows you're
just after his money.

1722
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:56,691
And I told him
what you had over me...

1723
01:39:56,767 --> 01:39:59,291
and he doesn't care that I'm gay.

1724
01:39:59,358 --> 01:40:02,837
I care. Of course, I care.
It's not good news.

1725
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:04,372
And you're moving out.

1726
01:40:04,449 --> 01:40:06,108
Maybe I should hear that from him.

1727
01:40:10,049 --> 01:40:11,901
I guess you're moving out.

1728
01:40:11,968 --> 01:40:14,778
But you can keep the ring.
I know it's worth something.

1729
01:40:14,845 --> 01:40:19,418
Frank, it's true.
It did start like that.

1730
01:40:19,486 --> 01:40:22,202
I'm sorry.

1731
01:40:22,268 --> 01:40:24,829
But I really like you. I--

1732
01:40:24,895 --> 01:40:27,679
- You can't fake that.
- I can't.

1733
01:40:27,745 --> 01:40:29,884
So? So, me too. Me--

1734
01:40:29,951 --> 01:40:31,158
Dad, Dad, Dad--

1735
01:40:31,236 --> 01:40:33,174
I gotta think about my boy.

1736
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:35,619
I mean, you used him.
You helped him humiliate his dad.

1737
01:40:35,677 --> 01:40:37,536
It's not good.

1738
01:40:37,604 --> 01:40:39,799
He might be gay,
but he's my only kid.

1739
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:41,295
I don't know about that.

1740
01:40:43,742 --> 01:40:45,171
I'm pregnant.

1741
01:40:45,247 --> 01:40:46,494
Jesus.

1742
01:40:46,561 --> 01:40:47,933
No, she is not! She's just--

1743
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,304
Hold it.

1744
01:40:50,465 --> 01:40:52,191
You are pregnant, aren't you?

1745
01:40:53,342 --> 01:40:55,202
It shouldn't make a difference.

1746
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:56,891
Do you know if it's a boy?

1747
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:58,302
What do you care?
You have a son.

1748
01:40:58,368 --> 01:41:00,572
Or a girl. I'm just asking.

1749
01:41:01,916 --> 01:41:04,794
Come on. This is
the oldest trick in the book!

1750
01:41:04,861 --> 01:41:06,243
Ask to see some tests
or something.

1751
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,118
Oh, fuck! OK.

1752
01:41:09,185 --> 01:41:10,644
It was worth a shot.

1753
01:41:10,722 --> 01:41:13,108
You can't blame a girl for trying.

1754
01:41:13,186 --> 01:41:15,256
I'm on the fucking pill, Frank.

1755
01:41:15,324 --> 01:41:19,187
What am I, stupid?
Like the world needs another Otis.

1756
01:41:19,265 --> 01:41:20,543
Hey! Hey!

1757
01:41:20,607 --> 01:41:23,063
I want you and everything you have
out of my house--

1758
01:41:23,139 --> 01:41:24,896
Otis will help you--
by tomorrow morning.

1759
01:41:24,961 --> 01:41:27,772
- No, that's cool. I'm packed.
- Great.

1760
01:41:29,373 --> 01:41:30,869
At least you've got
some fuckin' balls now...

1761
01:41:30,947 --> 01:41:34,266
which would be great, except it'll
just make your dick look smaller!

1762
01:41:34,334 --> 01:41:37,085
You know, Lane will tell me
whether you're pregnant or not.

1763
01:41:37,153 --> 01:41:39,741
Oh, call her. Tomorrow.
After 10:00.

1764
01:42:19,142 --> 01:42:20,550
I'm ready.

1765
01:43:51,364 --> 01:43:53,914
Good morning. Charley?

1766
01:43:55,333 --> 01:43:57,503
You can put your shirt on. I...

1767
01:43:57,568 --> 01:44:00,542
I just wanted
to tell you this in person.

1768
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:02,556
Not good, huh?

1769
01:44:02,633 --> 01:44:06,556
Well, you know,
as you can see...

1770
01:44:06,633 --> 01:44:08,569
sometimes it's reversible
and sometimes it's not.

1771
01:44:08,646 --> 01:44:11,130
It's just the luck of the draw.

1772
01:44:11,207 --> 01:44:15,072
Who let you have
a vasectomy at 21?

1773
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:18,370
Well, it's all theoretical, you know?

1774
01:44:18,437 --> 01:44:20,346
I don't even want kids, anyway.

1775
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:25,276
Well...OK, then.

1776
01:44:25,352 --> 01:44:26,974
Thanks, doctor.

1777
01:44:27,042 --> 01:44:28,192
Ted.

1778
01:44:29,765 --> 01:44:31,452
Ted?

1779
01:44:34,243 --> 01:44:37,379
I was wondering if I could...

1780
01:44:37,447 --> 01:44:41,216
if I could give you a call,
now that we're done professionally.

1781
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:44,449
Yeah, sure.

1782
01:44:47,526 --> 01:44:50,433
Great. I got your number.

1783
01:45:02,728 --> 01:45:06,143
Last night, you found out
they were wrong...

1784
01:45:06,219 --> 01:45:08,674
Hi. Can I sit here?

1785
01:45:08,742 --> 01:45:09,950
Thanks.

1786
01:45:13,767 --> 01:45:16,997
- You're Mr. McKee, right?
- Right.

1787
01:45:18,246 --> 01:45:20,959
So, I hear Jude
fucked you over, basically.

1788
01:45:21,026 --> 01:45:24,096
Me, too. I'm Lane.

1789
01:45:24,164 --> 01:45:26,052
Otis' girlfriend.

1790
01:45:27,203 --> 01:45:29,542
No one told me.

1791
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:32,833
I have a boyfriend. Rick.

1792
01:45:32,899 --> 01:45:34,597
Asshole.

1793
01:45:36,006 --> 01:45:38,942
Just keep your head on straight...

1794
01:45:39,018 --> 01:45:40,955
I don't think she's off everything...

1795
01:45:41,031 --> 01:45:42,596
but she's better.

1796
01:45:43,748 --> 01:45:45,759
She's still fat, though.

1797
01:45:45,827 --> 01:45:48,322
Otis is so cute.

1798
01:45:48,389 --> 01:45:50,594
That should have been your tip-off.

1799
01:45:52,552 --> 01:45:54,459
I don't think Otis knows
what he is.

1800
01:45:54,536 --> 01:45:59,206
I think he just finds the idea of gay
attractive theoretically.

1801
01:45:59,274 --> 01:46:01,441
Because of all
the blow jobs you get?

1802
01:46:03,111 --> 01:46:04,798
I don't know.

1803
01:46:04,875 --> 01:46:07,684
Some guys are gay,
but you can flip 'em.

1804
01:46:07,752 --> 01:46:09,756
He's what I call a real homo.

1805
01:46:09,832 --> 01:46:11,561
No offense.

1806
01:46:13,353 --> 01:46:15,205
Hey...

1807
01:46:15,269 --> 01:46:17,602
I don't think it's hereditary.

1808
01:46:17,669 --> 01:46:20,516
It's a choice, OK?

1809
01:46:28,324 --> 01:46:29,569
Yeah.

1810
01:46:33,034 --> 01:46:34,404
Would you like another drink?

1811
01:46:34,472 --> 01:46:36,640
Do it. That is beautiful.

1812
01:46:36,715 --> 01:46:37,924
Thank you.

1813
01:46:37,992 --> 01:46:40,514
- I wanna drive it.
- Not tonight.

1814
01:46:40,581 --> 01:46:41,799
- Give me the keys.
- No.

1815
01:46:41,867 --> 01:46:43,074
Get in.

1816
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:45,280
- Oh, my God, man.
- Yeah.

1817
01:46:45,356 --> 01:46:48,005
This is fuckin' rad.
What does all this stuff do?

1818
01:46:48,072 --> 01:46:52,350
I'm not sure, but this is a--
like, a Techtronic gear shift.

1819
01:46:52,425 --> 01:46:55,590
So, if you just do that,
it's in reverse.

1820
01:46:55,657 --> 01:46:57,029
So it's real easy to operate.

1821
01:46:59,494 --> 01:47:01,248
Jesus.

1822
01:47:05,478 --> 01:47:07,848
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I don't--I think so.

1823
01:47:07,915 --> 01:47:09,670
- I ran into--
- It's not my fault.

1824
01:47:09,738 --> 01:47:10,849
No, it's my fault.

1825
01:47:10,926 --> 01:47:11,933
- Is it my fault?-
- No, my fault.

1826
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:13,601
- Oh, my God. Oh, no.
- I'll pay for it.

1827
01:47:13,668 --> 01:47:14,983
- Oh, no.
- Frank, come on.

1828
01:47:18,542 --> 01:47:20,928
- Here, here, here.
- God!

1829
01:47:21,005 --> 01:47:22,242
Take a drink.

1830
01:47:25,388 --> 01:47:28,197
I'll fix the car.
You're--you're OK, though?

1831
01:47:28,265 --> 01:47:29,694
Yeah, I think I'm all right.

1832
01:47:29,771 --> 01:47:31,142
- I'm Frank.
- Nothing hurts.

1833
01:47:31,210 --> 01:47:32,620
I'll pay for everything. Here.

1834
01:47:32,677 --> 01:47:34,211
I am--I'm gonna have to...

1835
01:47:34,442 --> 01:47:38,239
I gave her the fuckin' tapes.
She won't sing it like Jude.

1836
01:47:38,317 --> 01:47:40,839
- It offends her.
- Yeah, whatever.

1837
01:47:40,907 --> 01:47:44,705
And if you think
she's clean and sober, wake up.

1838
01:47:44,782 --> 01:47:46,402
That's all I'm sayin'.

1839
01:47:48,425 --> 01:47:49,576
What?

1840
01:48:51,598 --> 01:48:54,889
Hey, you want any of this stuff?

1841
01:48:54,954 --> 01:48:57,670
It's just like, you know,
phone charger and...

1842
01:48:57,736 --> 01:49:00,672
Thomas Brothers Guide,
which I could use if you don't want it.

1843
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:03,942
Yeah. Sure as hell
not gonna use it in Phoenix.

1844
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:05,390
Yeah, take it.

1845
01:49:19,114 --> 01:49:20,580
What?

1846
01:49:20,648 --> 01:49:22,854
Oh, it's his license number.

1847
01:49:23,947 --> 01:49:25,357
The Mexican guy?

1848
01:49:26,863 --> 01:49:29,991
Yeah. Yeah.

1849
01:49:30,057 --> 01:49:32,426
Do you know anyone
who could trace it?

1850
01:49:32,493 --> 01:49:34,767
Javier lives here?

1851
01:49:34,833 --> 01:49:36,973
- Nice house.
- I know.

1852
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:39,273
What does he charge
for a massage?

1853
01:49:39,341 --> 01:49:42,641
- I have to talk to him.
- OK.

1854
01:49:42,699 --> 01:49:44,127
Oh, please, Charley, no.

1855
01:49:44,204 --> 01:49:46,110
I'm gonna--
I need to do this myself.

1856
01:49:46,188 --> 01:49:48,875
Look. OK.
You're on my speed dial.

1857
01:49:48,941 --> 01:49:50,916
All I have to do is press send.

1858
01:49:50,994 --> 01:49:53,505
You're one thumb away
if I need you, which I don't.

1859
01:49:53,583 --> 01:49:54,532
Mamie--

1860
01:49:54,609 --> 01:49:57,919
I'm gonna come back tomorrow
or the next day by myself.

1861
01:49:57,996 --> 01:50:01,091
So, it's your choice.

1862
01:50:04,881 --> 01:50:06,090
- Hello?
- Hi.

1863
01:50:06,156 --> 01:50:07,845
You don't know me,
I'm from Los Angeles.

1864
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,638
I'm looking for Nicky.

1865
01:50:09,706 --> 01:50:11,749
No, there's no Nicky here.
Sorry.

1866
01:50:11,825 --> 01:50:14,060
Wait, wait, yeah.
He said that might be a nickname.

1867
01:50:14,125 --> 01:50:16,937
Do you know--
do you know this guy?

1868
01:50:18,001 --> 01:50:20,302
Ronnie, my brother.

1869
01:50:20,369 --> 01:50:23,678
OK. Could I maybe speak
with your mom or dad?

1870
01:50:23,754 --> 01:50:25,768
They're in Hawaii. Hold on.

1871
01:50:25,835 --> 01:50:28,454
Tom, someone's here
about Ronnie.

1872
01:50:28,521 --> 01:50:30,410
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

1873
01:50:32,242 --> 01:50:33,893
Do you want a Coke or something?

1874
01:50:33,969 --> 01:50:35,686
No. Thanks.

1875
01:50:35,762 --> 01:50:37,383
Tom is my other brother.

1876
01:50:42,351 --> 01:50:44,038
Hi.

1877
01:50:44,106 --> 01:50:45,575
- Hi.
- I'm Tom.

1878
01:50:45,651 --> 01:50:48,960
You're a friend of Ronnie's?

1879
01:50:49,037 --> 01:50:52,172
Yeah. I mean,
I don't--I don't know.

1880
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:56,939
He told me his name
was...Nicky.

1881
01:50:57,007 --> 01:50:58,212
So...

1882
01:50:58,289 --> 01:51:00,141
- Yeah, he's--
- That's--that's him.

1883
01:51:00,209 --> 01:51:03,747
Oh. Yeah. He's--
he's not here.

1884
01:51:03,824 --> 01:51:06,826
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing. No, nothing.

1885
01:51:06,894 --> 01:51:09,895
We were partners
on a film project.

1886
01:51:09,962 --> 01:51:12,897
Yeah, we worked together
about six months ago.

1887
01:51:12,973 --> 01:51:15,046
Does he owe you money?

1888
01:51:15,123 --> 01:51:16,398
- He's an asshole.
- Becca.

1889
01:51:16,465 --> 01:51:19,879
No, this is--it's not a big deal.
I was just--

1890
01:51:19,946 --> 01:51:21,836
I was in town
and I just thought I'd drop by.

1891
01:51:21,902 --> 01:51:23,217
It's OK.

1892
01:51:23,274 --> 01:51:27,053
Well, wait a second.
He called last week.

1893
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:28,875
The number's on my cell phone
in the car.

1894
01:51:30,286 --> 01:51:33,067
- You want it?
- OK. Sure.

1895
01:51:33,135 --> 01:51:34,179
- OK.
- Thanks.

1896
01:51:34,255 --> 01:51:36,490
- Yeah. I'll be right back.
-OK.

1897
01:51:37,803 --> 01:51:40,623
- Do you want to sit down?
- No. Thanks.

1898
01:51:42,129 --> 01:51:45,391
Dad says Ronnie's a black sheep.
He's in New York now...

1899
01:51:45,458 --> 01:51:48,038
but he's supposed to be
in some art school.

1900
01:51:48,114 --> 01:51:50,147
But Tom doesn't believe it.

1901
01:51:51,882 --> 01:51:53,860
He burned down our house once.

1902
01:51:53,937 --> 01:51:56,170
Well, the garage.

1903
01:51:56,237 --> 01:51:57,514
It's where I had my bike.

1904
01:51:59,058 --> 01:52:00,236
OK, I got it.

1905
01:52:00,304 --> 01:52:02,606
He didn't even give this to me,
but it was--

1906
01:52:02,673 --> 01:52:04,563
That's all right. Never mind.

1907
01:52:04,619 --> 01:52:05,771
Wait a minute.
Don't you want his number?

1908
01:52:05,839 --> 01:52:08,908
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1909
01:52:10,288 --> 01:52:13,108
- Her purse.
- Shit.

1910
01:52:14,642 --> 01:52:16,138
Mamie?

1911
01:52:18,737 --> 01:52:20,080
Hey! You all right?

1912
01:52:20,146 --> 01:52:21,489
Mamie!

1913
01:52:21,557 --> 01:52:23,659
Hey! Hey.
What did you do to her?

1914
01:52:23,725 --> 01:52:25,488
Nothing. Her purse.

1915
01:52:25,556 --> 01:52:26,986
Hey!

1916
01:52:27,052 --> 01:52:28,779
Who the fuck are you?

1917
01:52:28,846 --> 01:52:30,025
Asshole.

1918
01:52:30,092 --> 01:52:31,723
Mamie, stop!

1919
01:52:34,226 --> 01:52:35,789
Mamie!

1920
01:52:43,347 --> 01:52:44,594
Mamie!

1921
01:52:50,099 --> 01:52:52,362
Oh, my God!

1922
01:52:52,429 --> 01:52:54,223
Oh, my God!

1923
01:52:59,056 --> 01:53:00,552
Do you have a cell phone?

1924
01:53:00,630 --> 01:53:02,509
- Yeah!
- Mamie.

1925
01:53:06,901 --> 01:53:07,849
Mamie.

1926
01:53:23,062 --> 01:53:24,614
Are you OK, Charley?

1927
01:53:27,952 --> 01:53:29,065
Yeah.

1928
01:53:29,143 --> 01:53:31,472
I have something for you.
It's in my purse.

1929
01:53:32,948 --> 01:53:34,705
It's right there.

1930
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:53,002
You said you lost it.

1931
01:53:53,070 --> 01:53:55,757
No, I left it for the baby.

1932
01:53:55,824 --> 01:53:57,770
Something from you.

1933
01:53:59,479 --> 01:54:01,548
Did you name him?

1934
01:54:01,616 --> 01:54:03,370
No.

1935
01:54:03,448 --> 01:54:05,616
But I held him once.

1936
01:54:08,818 --> 01:54:10,708
I don't know why I didn't tell you.

1937
01:54:15,062 --> 01:54:17,229
So...

1938
01:54:17,297 --> 01:54:19,790
he knew who you were and...

1939
01:54:19,858 --> 01:54:21,718
he didn't want to find you?

1940
01:54:22,965 --> 01:54:25,201
That's what Nicky said.
Ronnie.

1941
01:54:26,773 --> 01:54:29,228
Well, when he's smarter,
he'll want to find you.

1942
01:54:30,456 --> 01:54:32,239
Maybe he's smart now.

1943
01:54:34,417 --> 01:54:35,404
No.

1944
01:54:36,976 --> 01:54:40,294
It's better to know you
than to not know you.

1945
01:54:40,371 --> 01:54:43,191
That's how I've always felt.

1946
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:51,593
It's OK.

1947
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:56,013
I run with scissors, too.

1948
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:07,915
Does this do color?

1949
01:56:48,664 --> 01:56:50,671
Jump real good? OK.

1950
01:58:21,369 --> 01:58:25,196
Don't go changing

1951
01:58:25,272 --> 01:58:28,025
To try to please me

1952
01:58:29,213 --> 01:58:33,395
You never let me down before

1953
01:58:36,599 --> 01:58:40,118
Don't imagine

1954
01:58:40,186 --> 01:58:43,254
You're too familiar

1955
01:58:44,281 --> 01:58:49,459
And I don't see you anymore

1956
01:58:51,159 --> 01:58:55,414
I would not leave you

1957
01:58:55,482 --> 01:58:59,157
In times of trouble

1958
01:58:59,222 --> 01:59:03,453
We never could have
come this far

1959
01:59:06,522 --> 01:59:10,549
I took the good times

1960
01:59:10,616 --> 01:59:14,127
I'll take the bad times

1961
01:59:14,202 --> 01:59:20,343
I'll take you just the way you are

1962
01:59:25,723 --> 01:59:29,174
Don't go trying

1963
01:59:29,241 --> 01:59:32,405
Some new fashion

1964
01:59:32,473 --> 01:59:38,191
Don't change the color
of your hair

1965
01:59:40,703 --> 01:59:44,212
You always have my

1966
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:48,058
Unspoken passion

1967
01:59:48,126 --> 01:59:53,143
Though I might not seem to care

1968
01:59:54,685 --> 02:00:03,097
I don't want clever conversation

1969
02:00:03,164 --> 02:00:07,921
I don't want to work that hard

1970
02:00:10,271 --> 02:00:13,531
I just want someone

1971
02:00:13,598 --> 02:00:18,106
That I can talk to

1972
02:00:18,173 --> 02:00:24,311
I want you just the way you are

1973
02:00:29,375 --> 02:00:36,280
I need to know
that you will always be

1974
02:00:37,344 --> 02:00:41,649
The same old someone that I knew

1975
02:00:44,633 --> 02:00:50,684
What will it take
till you believe in me

1976
02:00:52,220 --> 02:00:57,139
The way that I believe in you?

1977
02:00:59,394 --> 02:01:03,642
I said I love you

1978
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:07,095
And that's forever

1979
02:01:07,163 --> 02:01:12,350
This I promise from my heart

1980
02:01:15,065 --> 02:01:17,522
I could not love you

1981
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:21,394
Any better

1982
02:01:22,459 --> 02:01:29,047
I love you just the way you are

1983
02:01:29,114 --> 02:01:33,489
Are

1984
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:41,784
You are

1985
02:01:55,207 --> 02:01:58,802
THE END
