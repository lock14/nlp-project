1
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,434
Room 207?

2
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,993
Are you a relative?

3
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,473
Visiting hours end at 8:30.
You'll hear the announcement.

4
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,673
You can use those elevators.

5
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,593
Here she comes!

6
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,950
Hi.

7
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,195
Hi.

8
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,959
Hi.

9
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,918
Are you the birthday boy?

10
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,079
Who is this?

11
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,715
Listen up.
There's nothing to it.

12
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,118
First, the 60 euros.
Second, nobody touches anything.

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,750
Except me.

14
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,917
You wanna touch, you pay more.

15
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,872
And nobody goes near my backpack.

16
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,470
And by nobody I mean nobody, okay?

17
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,757
Let's celebrate your birthday.

18
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,432
<i>If life gives you</i>

19
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,430
<i>more than five reasons to go on.</i>

20
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,397
<i>If life gives you</i>

21
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,469
<i>more than five corners to sleep in.</i>

22
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,432
<i>If life gives you</i>

23
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,314
<i>more than five million to die...</i>

24
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,317
<i>You strain yourself.</i>

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,597
<i>Night and day.</i>

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,116
<i>You strain yourself.</i>

27
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,438
<i>Night and day.</i>

28
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,078
<i>If life gives you</i>

29
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,314
<i>more than five bastards
to put up with.</i>

30
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,919
<i>If life gives you</i>

31
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,115
<i>more than five lessons
to not go on...</i>

32
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,072
<i>You strain yourself.</i>

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,432
<i>Night and day.</i>

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,991
<i>You strain yourself.</i>

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,278
<i>Night and day.</i>

36
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,152
<i>If life gives you</i>

37
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,229
<i>more than five reasons to go on.</i>

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,998
<i>If life gives you</i>

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,195
<i>more than five corners to sleep in.</i>

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,311
<i>You strain yourself.</i>

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,712
<i>Night and day.</i>

42
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,151
<i>You strain yourself.</i>

43
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,477
<i>Night and day.</i>

44
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,070
<i>You strain yourself.</i>

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,911
<i>You strain yourself.</i>

46
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,473
-How's it going?
-Better.

47
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,398
Having lunch with your mother?

48
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,279
And give me some pessaries.

49
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,710
And four twelve-packs.
Supersensitive.

50
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,475
Was it Canesten?

51
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,396
Yes.

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,309
Zero kilos. You're so light.

53
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,238
That means you're an angel.

54
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,519
You have to put a coin in
for it to work.

55
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,797
It's from a local store.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,069
What does it say?

57
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,316
''With love.'' The fourth one.

58
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,633
Must be a neighbourhood fan.

59
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,912
-Let me see the handwriting.
-Wine?

60
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,238
He could be from the senior center.

61
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,278
What about the guy
from the 5th floor?

62
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,040
Him? He hardly says hi
when he sees me.

63
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,434
Exactly.

64
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,550
Someone older.

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,109
Maybe they have the wrong address.

66
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,389
What?

67
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,874
Mother can't have an admirer?

68
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,399
Of course she can.

69
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,318
She can have as many as she wants.

70
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,639
You get them,
that's what matters.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,072
We exist because someone
thinks about us, not vice versa.

72
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,877
Someone said that,
I don't remember who.

73
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,036
Someone wise.

74
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,912
Wise and corny.

75
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,952
Aren't you going to answer?

76
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,675
What if it's for me?

77
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,591
For you?
It's my cell phone.

78
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,875
Since they keep ringing...

79
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,911
It might be important.

80
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,228
How's your teaching?

81
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,478
She's not teaching anymore.

82
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,234
I知 the principal now.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,797
Congratulations.
That's good, right?

84
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,311
Yeah.

85
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,476
Since 2 years ago.

86
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,072
Really? Congratulations.

87
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,238
Maybe it's Dad.

88
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,434
Sending the flowers.

89
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,909
Why not? Maybe he felt guilty.

90
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,349
Maybe.

91
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,272
lf he hadn't died 3 years ago.

92
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,829
That's not certain.

93
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,791
You identified him at the morgue.

94
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,795
I didn't look that close.
I said yes without looking.

95
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,029
Mother, please.

96
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,031
We didn't check his DNA.

97
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,800
With DNA you can tell
who it is right away.

98
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,796
Dad is dead,

99
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,035
period.

100
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,909
Maybe he ran off with a woman
and doesn't dare come back.

101
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,274
Hence the flowers.

102
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,158
To say he's sorry and thinking
of me, without saying it.

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,595
Your father was always a coward,
Cayetana. A good man,

104
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,394
but a coward.

105
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,554
Answer the phone!

106
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,951
I get nervous
when you don't answer!

107
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,069
Who is this?

108
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,029
Lima.

109
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,669
Lima.

110
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,313
No. Why?

111
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,829
So they say.

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,069
Brunette.

113
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,475
Average.

114
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,311
100. The works, 100.

115
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,239
Blowjob, 50.

116
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,838
Anything except in the ass.

117
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,199
As long as it takes,
half an hour.

118
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,879
Half an hour, tops.

119
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,550
Who is it?

120
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,670
What?

121
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,432
What else can I say?

122
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,197
At Vidal's on Providencia.

123
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,275
They're the worst.

124
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,750
The worst, Gloria.
Since they came, this is a jungle.

125
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,352
They'll fuck for 20 euros.
Some even for 15.

126
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,955
Blowjobs for 10, like junkies.

127
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,388
But guys like them.

128
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,715
It must be the novelty.

129
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,316
Gloria,

130
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,433
I only work half as much
since they came.

131
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,155
They have to do something.
There's no work in their countries.

132
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,750
Don't people fuck there?
They must have learned somewhere.

133
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,195
lf they were hairdressers,
you wouldn't be defending them.

134
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,794
What racists.

135
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,078
That's not it. You're wrong.

136
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,913
It's not racism.

137
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,192
The problem is the market.
The laws of the market.

138
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,076
Not the supermarket, the other one.
It's demand and competition.

139
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
There's not enough demand
and there's no competition.

140
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,156
The Minister of Economics
said it on TV.

141
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,312
They come here and do
as they fucking please.

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,353
The Minister said that?

143
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,396
Not the ''fucking'' part,
but he definitely thought it.

144
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,033
And he's a minister.

145
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,476
He must know
what he's talking about.

146
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,957
You know more
about blowjobs, Caye.

147
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,272
But the Minister of Economics
knows more about economics.

148
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,671
Rosa's the expert on ministers.

149
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,313
No comment.

150
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,590
And the cops.
What good are they?

151
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,308
These girls don't even know
what working papers are.

152
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,079
Don't be mean, Caren.

153
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,315
Believe me.

154
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,553
lf they were lawyers...

155
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,591
Have you really
screwed ministers?

156
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,028
A bit of everything.

157
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,954
And ministers too?

158
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,880
The secret service followed me
and my phone's been bugged

159
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,308
so many times...

160
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,910
You wouldn't be here if you screwed
a minister. You'd have a nice house.

161
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,950
Hello?

162
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,115
I didn't want a house,
but I had plenty of offers.

163
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,509
With ducks and everything.

164
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,914
Who did you screw?

165
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,428
You'd never believe me.

166
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,915
45.

167
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,110
How big?

168
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,998
How much were these?

169
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,031
2,000 euros. 2,500.

170
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,039
The bastard was jerking off.

171
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,594
I know where you get a perfect
boob job for 1 ,000.

172
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,758
1 ,000? lf you're going to get one,
do it right.

173
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,315
But smaller tits are in right now.

174
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,555
It gets you more work.

175
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,915
Look how she walks,

176
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,993
sticking her ass out.

177
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,153
They learn how to do it as kids.

178
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,357
They put stuff in their shoes

179
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,073
to make them walk like that.

180
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,156
Come on.

181
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,918
I saw it on the BBC.

182
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,237
And they smell different.
Hormones.

183
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,990
The strong smell attracts the guys.

184
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,556
They don't bathe.
It's a cultural or religious thing.

185
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,636
Almost finished?

186
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,434
Let them wait.
Good things are worth waiting for.

187
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,790
Like cleavage and a G-string,
but in hormones.

188
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,795
-Hi, Caye.
-Hi.

189
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,152
Are you meeting Lima?

190
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,070
At five.
And it's ten past already.

191
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,389
Yeah. I got held up.

192
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,234
One minute.

193
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,589
Shall we go?

194
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,114
You're too late.

195
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,438
Couldn't you wait 10 minutes?
I came from the other side of town.

196
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,189
Give me the bill.

197
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,468
At least pay for my taxi.

198
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,073
I知 not paying you anything.

199
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,189
What about you?

200
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,759
Didn't you hear the Minister?

201
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,908
Can't you talk?

202
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,879
There are rules around here.
This isn't the jungle!

203
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,032
You come to this country
and do whatever you fucking want!

204
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,552
Watch. Nothing will happen.

205
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,599
They take the one in blue away
every 3 days.

206
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,110
lf they take them away
I値l blow them myself.

207
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,478
You have loose ends.

208
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,999
She's got everything loose.

209
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,316
Angela's very loose in general.

210
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,553
Well? Why don't you try it?

211
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,074
She's got a good ass.
You could make some extra cash.

212
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,871
Forget it.

213
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,510
Another one.

214
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,432
Mamen's very popular.

215
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,471
Guys like piercings.

216
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,478
What about my boyfriend?

217
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,635
Look after him.

218
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,434
I知 as faithful as they come.
I can screw 30 guys

219
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,552
and I知 still faithful.
It's just a job.

220
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,475
Maybe you go to a club
with your friends,

221
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,875
have a few drinks,

222
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,275
see someone you like
and fuck him.

223
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,309
Nice and tan.

224
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,710
Well-built.

225
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,238
With his tongue pierced.

226
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,519
I壇 fuck him.

227
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,751
You see? I wouldn't.

228
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,238
Bring him in sometime to meet us.

229
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,511
Who, my boyfriend?
No way.

230
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,628
What does he do?

231
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,355
He takes pictures.

232
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,629
Of who?

233
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,156
I don't know, of nobody.
He likes it.

234
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,515
Hey!

235
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,835
Hey!

236
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,796
Hello?

237
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,830
Hello?

238
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,788
Hello?

239
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,913
Hold your breath.

240
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,799
I don't have papers.

241
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,879
They won't ask for them.

242
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,434
lf they do, say you left them
at home, but they won't.

243
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,639
Do I have to pay for this?

244
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,674
It's free.

245
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,268
Do you know him?

246
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,193
From before.

247
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,236
He's getting me a work permit.

248
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,314
A customer?

249
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,075
I fuck him for free.

250
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,792
Down payment for my papers.

251
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,314
What happened today?

252
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,148
I said no.

253
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,714
The same thing happened
the last time.

254
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,670
I had to screw him
so he would go.

255
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,473
Is he a cop?

256
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,355
My friend says he is,
but I don't know.

257
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,834
Your friend introduced you?

258
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,677
Sulema?

259
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,991
Where do you buy your clothes?

260
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,559
I'll take you one day.

261
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,708
He's a bastard.

262
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,151
He can't hit you.

263
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,270
Press charges.

264
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,519
We have rights, you know?
They said it on TV.

265
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,756
Without papers, I can't.

266
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,959
How long you been here?

267
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,989
Ten months.

268
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,071
I applied for residence.
I didn't get it.

269
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,119
Are you in the park?

270
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,679
That's where I found out
about the apartment.

271
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,156
From Marga, a Colombian.
You know her?

272
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,879
I want to move. It's expensive.

273
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,717
I have a kid back home,

274
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,909
with my mom.

275
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,599
I send them money.

276
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,715
I want to save up and bring him here
so he can take care of me.

277
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,835
He's handsome.

278
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,239
Looks like a little monkey.

279
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,669
Edward.

280
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,799
Little Edward.

281
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,354
Do they know what you do?

282
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,872
Mom would die if she knew.

283
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,270
I say I work in a bar.

284
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,108
What about your family?

285
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,555
They don't know either.

286
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,519
This is temporary.

287
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,833
I'm saving up, too.

288
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,595
To buy a pair of tits like yours.

289
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,635
What?

290
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,319
Did you see him?

291
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,078
I saw him on the stairs.

292
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,668
I bet it was the mob.

293
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,350
She owed them money
and they collected.

294
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,758
How long has she been here?

295
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,872
Maybe she tried to rob him.

296
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,989
In her apartment?

297
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,679
They're not too bright.

298
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,389
Look who's here.

299
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,476
Miss Methadone.

300
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,159
You're so mean, Angela.

301
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,794
Once she was so pretty,
she drove the neighbourhood crazy.

302
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,513
And now look at her.

303
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,869
Hi, Gloria.

304
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,229
Hi, girls.

305
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,910
Can I use your bathroom?

306
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,869
It's broken.

307
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,115
I'll only be a minute.

308
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,275
Try Jose's.

309
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,192
I was already there.
His is broken, too.

310
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,155
Hi, Caye.

311
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,631
You look so pretty.

312
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,234
How's your morning going?

313
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,908
Okay, turned a few tricks already.

314
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,399
Gloria, let me in, please.

315
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,555
I can't.

316
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,073
Fuck, I won't mess it up.

317
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,589
It's broken.

318
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,433
Piece of shit bathrooms.

319
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,399
They're always broken.

320
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,589
That's the way it is.

321
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,353
Yeah, whatever.

322
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,869
See you later, Gloria.

323
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,557
I like the ones with cross-straps
and with single straps, too.

324
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,430
Those are the colours I like.

325
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,073
I want this colour.

326
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,279
Perfectly made, honey.

327
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,959
And they're on sale.

328
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,028
How pretty!

329
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,390
How much?

330
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,959
Two for a euro.

331
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,036
It's banana leaf with corn
and a little meat. You'll love it.

332
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,952
Comfortable panties. Flexible ones,
light ones, quality ones.

333
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,998
Ladies, try them on.
Make yourselves at home.

334
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,270
Come, sinners, if you're not wearing
panties, you're going to hell.

335
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,952
Look at these panties!

336
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,472
My son's birthday is on the 12th.

337
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,154
He's turning five.

338
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,079
Take care, okay?

339
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,119
Take care.

340
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,950
Do everything Grandma tells you.

341
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,752
Are you behaving yourself?

342
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,911
Mommy misses you a lot too.

343
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,479
We'll see each other again soon,
you'll see.

344
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,113
Real soon, my darling.

345
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,234
Listen.

346
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,597
How was school this week?

347
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,749
How was it?

348
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,758
Me too, my darling.
Hang on just a little longer.

349
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,155
Tell Grandma to sing you
the song you like.

350
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,433
You'll love it, you'll see.

351
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,869
Zulema!

352
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,636
It's been so long!

353
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,709
How are you?

354
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,232
You're nearly as tall as I am.

355
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,750
It's been a long time, Waiter.
How are you?

356
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,718
Since Juancito's birthday.

357
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,473
The black guy likes you.

358
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,118
Forget it. I don't like them.

359
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,234
To fuck, I mean.
lf it's work, I don't care,

360
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,510
but not for free.
I prefer white guys.

361
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,555
But it's the same thing.

362
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,515
No, it isn't.

363
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,037
How could it be?
There are differences.

364
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,435
Pigments and stuff
I won't mention here,

365
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,637
but you see it in documentaries.

366
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,552
I used to feel that way too.

367
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,314
It put me off, their whiteness.

368
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,155
You do everything?

369
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,515
Just about.

370
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,516
Me, too.

371
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,955
Except swallow, it makes me puke.

372
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,868
And not up the ass.

373
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,429
Me, neither.

374
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,039
I let them watch videos.

375
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,748
They come faster.
Girl on girl action, cum shots...

376
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,912
They freak at the video store.

377
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,709
I tell them things.

378
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,035
Like what?

379
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,758
All kinds of filthy shit.

380
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,549
Stick it to me. Deeper.
Fill me up with cream.

381
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,034
Fill me up with cream?

382
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,556
I swear. They love it.

383
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,831
I don't know why.
Works like magic.

384
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,234
I say it and they're off.

385
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,271
I'll try it.
Fill it up with cream.

386
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,112
Fill me up with cream.

387
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,479
Fill me up with cream.

388
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,110
And always with a rubber,
or no deal.

389
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,229
Do you take tests?

390
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,397
They used to test us at the club,
but not anymore.

391
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,869
I'm clean.

392
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,873
Are you working today?

393
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,675
I'm going out.

394
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,195
Does it make you nostalgic?

395
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,515
What?

396
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,915
Everything. The food.

397
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,195
A little.

398
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,112
Weird, isn't it? Nostalgia.

399
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,074
It's not a bad thing in itself.

400
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,399
It means you had good times

401
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,635
and you miss them.

402
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,871
Me, I don't feel nostalgic.

403
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,637
Nothing worth missing
has ever happened to me.

404
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,469
Talk about shitty.

405
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,510
Can you feel nostalgic over
something that hasn't happened yet?

406
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,233
Because sometimes, I do.

407
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,154
I imagine how things
are going to be,

408
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,518
with boys, for example,

409
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,712
or life in general.

410
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,957
And I feel sad when I remember
how nice they were going to be,

411
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,437
because they were going
to be beautiful,

412
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,239
really beautiful.

413
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,198
Then, I feel nostalgic

414
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,395
because they were
going to be so beautiful.

415
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,150
And when I realize
they haven't happened yet,

416
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,078
that they may never happen,

417
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,232
I get really sad.

418
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,238
Really sad.

419
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,397
It's like a down payment
of sadness.

420
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,836
Like a deposit on
a rented apartment,

421
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,473
but of sadness.

422
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,913
And you advance it
because you know eventually

423
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,553
you'll use it up anyway.

424
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,514
I've got another question.

425
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,832
When you're kids do they put
stuff in your shoes

426
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,115
to make your ass stick out?

427
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,116
Who?

428
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,994
I don't know. Someone.

429
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,269
Whoever.

430
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,749
Cream?

431
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,755
Yes, please. Cream.

432
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,996
-What was it?
-Fill me up with cream.

433
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,428
Fill me up with cream.

434
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,115
Fill us up with cream.

435
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,914
Fill us both up!

436
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,390
Bring us cream, please!

437
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,758
At least let me tell them.

438
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,990
I'm with my friends
and they're already inside.

439
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,792
I don't care.
You can't go in.

440
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,675
They just went in.
A tall guy and two others.

441
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,949
They just went in.

442
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,315
Nobody's gone in.

443
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,589
You just let three guys in.

444
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,596
Let him in.

445
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,589
Stay out of this.

446
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,789
I'm trying to help.

447
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,398
-Is he with you?
-No, I'm not.

448
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,751
I came with friends.
They'll be waiting for me inside.

449
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,512
Can I go in?

450
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,551
No.

451
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,232
You see?

452
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,631
lf you were with me,
you'd already be inside.

453
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,953
But I don't know you at all.

454
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,159
Can I speak with your superior?

455
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,114
I don't have a superior.

456
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,355
Who are you, God?

457
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,198
You're not missing anything.

458
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,914
-There's hardly any chicks.
-Was I talking to you?

459
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,636
No, right?

460
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,155
Are you coming?

461
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,315
What if they come out?

462
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,394
They're not coming out.

463
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,789
Why are you alone?

464
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,308
I like going out alone.

465
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,469
Isn't it boring?

466
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,274
At least no one
leaves me waiting outside.

467
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,229
What's your name?

468
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,355
That depends.

469
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,709
On what?

470
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,708
On the day.

471
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,958
I've got two names.
Which do you prefer?

472
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,309
Which one do you like?

473
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,835
Caye.

474
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,199
Cayetana, Caye.

475
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,633
You're weird, Caye.

476
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,195
Do I scare you?

477
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,955
A little.

478
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,555
Want to go back?

479
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,275
What do you do?

480
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,238
I work with computers.
I'm a programmer.

481
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,591
But I want to set up
my own business.

482
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,551
Like Bill Gates. He started
from scratch and look at him.

483
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,275
Is he doing well?

484
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,317
Well? He's a fucking genius.

485
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,717
He built an empire from nothing.

486
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,831
You know how hard that is?

487
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,675
Very, right?

488
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,398
He's a god. He's passionate.

489
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,559
That's why he's been successful.

490
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,072
You have to be passionate
about everything. Computers, life...

491
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,508
everything.

492
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,148
Are you passionate
in your work?

493
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,195
Very.

494
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,749
Great. It's the only way.

495
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,076
Like I say, whatever you do,
do it with passion.

496
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,679
lf not, don't bother.

497
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,031
-Do you like computers?
-The new ones, especially.

498
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,275
I can give you software.

499
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,994
Design, music...
whatever you want.

500
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,076
Great.

501
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,554
What do you do?

502
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,393
I'm a whore.

503
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,234
That's funny.

504
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,829
A whore.

505
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,148
Hilarious.

506
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,909
Zulema?

507
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,756
Yes?

508
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,510
Who is it?

509
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,070
Zulema?

510
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,476
She's not here.
Try again in the morning.

511
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,395
I pay half.
One shift, until eight.

512
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,793
I get it in the daytime.

513
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,792
It's called the warm bed
because it's never empty.

514
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,278
It's better than sharing a place.

515
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,469
That's half the time.
Some beds you only get for 8 hours,

516
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,989
just to sleep in.

517
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,394
Are they nice?

518
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,795
They're from back home.

519
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,435
We hardly talk.

520
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,390
The less they know the better.

521
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,798
They might know someone back home

522
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,870
and gossip.

523
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,908
Do you like them?

524
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,358
Guys like them big, right?

525
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,394
Since her operation,
Angela's working a lot more.

526
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,030
There can be a psychological
reaction. Rejection.

527
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,554
Self-rejection.

528
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,876
Your body says no,

529
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,793
so you have to get them removed.

530
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,117
How does Manuel like them?

531
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,516
I don't know. I'll ask him.

532
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,315
You might scare him.

533
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,593
He's already scared.

534
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,348
He's a bit weird.
Always talking about computers.

535
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,192
I think I scare him.

536
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,116
But I like him, he's very funny.

537
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,389
You told him?

538
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,749
I told him

539
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,075
but he didn't believe me.

540
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,998
But you told him.

541
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,391
lf I told him

542
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,875
that I was a cashier or whatever,
he'd believe me.

543
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,114
And you know what
really pisses me off?

544
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,516
They can't pick you up
after work.

545
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,358
I'd really love that.

546
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,040
I'd work in an office
doing whatever, I don't care,

547
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,356
but I want to be picked up
after work.

548
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,069
Can you imagine?

549
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,796
See him there waiting,
from the window.

550
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,313
And he's really hot and
the other girls are green with envy.

551
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,276
Just think.

552
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,911
Just saying it is amazing.

553
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,914
''Pick me up.''

554
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,913
That's what love is, right?
Being picked up after work.

555
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,993
The rest is bullshit.

556
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,554
Forget flowers and rings.

557
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,711
They can stick that up their ass.

558
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,071
I just want to be picked up
after work.

559
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,318
Is it the same in your country?

560
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,590
Have you ever
been picked up after work?

561
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,555
A few times.

562
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,675
How lucky.

563
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,516
Do you eat chicken there as well?

564
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,314
Chicken, rice, corn...

565
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,511
But we don't eat that much.

566
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,635
The heat?

567
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,034
No, the government.

568
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,591
Do you have cinemas
and shopping malls?

569
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,710
Mother, please.

570
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,796
What?

571
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,917
She's from Santo Domingo, not Mars.

572
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,076
For me, Santo Domingo
and Mars are the same.

573
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,592
How long does it take
to get there?

574
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,228
Ten hours by plane.

575
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,879
That's not so far.

576
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,316
I thought it would be farther.

577
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,589
Who wants dessert?

578
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,630
I'll help you, Pilar.

579
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,149
Do you miss it?

580
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,428
Mostly my son.

581
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,078
It might be someone from across

582
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,511
because I get them
only when I'm home.

583
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,556
She gets flowers
from a secret admirer.

584
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,435
How lucky.

585
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,868
It's not your father.

586
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,958
He would write something.

587
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,316
Maybe he's in Santo Domingo.

588
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,675
Is your father away?

589
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,513
As away as can be.

590
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,433
He's been buried for 3 years.

591
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,469
She can't accept it.

592
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,554
She misses him.

593
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,313
She's lonely, Carlos.

594
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,035
-Being lonely sucks.
-And she misses him.

595
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,113
But they were constantly
at each other's throats.

596
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,679
They weren't.

597
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,310
Are you like her now?
You make up whatever you don't like.

598
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,992
But they weren't. You just
choose to remember it that way.

599
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,031
I remember it the way
it really was.

600
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,754
You left home.
You don't know what it was like.

601
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,439
It's like the flowers,
or am I making that up too?

602
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,868
She sends them to herself.

603
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,116
She orders them from the florist's.

604
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,190
Really?

605
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,072
And she writes the cards.

606
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,356
In capitals so we won't realize.

607
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,791
And they're playing along.

608
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,149
They told us to
at the senior center.

609
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,318
Whatever, Carlos, but it scares me.

610
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,714
It's a fantasy.

611
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,239
Sending flowers every 3 days.

612
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,795
180 euros of fantasy a month.

613
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,395
What does she write?

614
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,035
On the cards.

615
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,238
What does she write to herself?

616
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,237
Do you like sweets, Zulema?

617
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,911
A lot.

618
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,993
You don't answer either?

619
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,915
Why do you even bother
buying cell phones?

620
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,469
I was telling Pilar
we need a lecturer.

621
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,709
What's the seminar about?

622
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,394
Sex education.

623
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,913
I know a lot about that.

624
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,759
I've done it a lot. Back home.

625
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,870
Seriously?

626
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,590
Sex education?

627
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,149
I'm an expert.

628
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,514
How much does it pay?

629
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,359
They're hypnotized.

630
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,758
I can do your makeup later.

631
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,072
I took a state course

632
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,599
in makeup for movies.

633
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,272
And another in catwalk modelling
but I couldn't keep my balance.

634
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,199
How's your balance?

635
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,235
Fine.

636
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,593
Mine's really bad.

637
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,151
As a kid, I was always falling.

638
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,157
One day I fell seven times.

639
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,918
My mother'd fill my pockets
with sand to make me heavier

640
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,269
so I wouldn't fall over.

641
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,873
So yeah, I couldn't do the catwalk.

642
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,955
That's why I love tightrope walkers.

643
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,279
I should marry one
to make up for it.

644
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,678
Are there any in your country?

645
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,915
Ten million of them.

646
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,153
Like princesses.

647
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,597
They're so sensitive
they can feel the earth rotating.

648
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,036
That's why they're dizzy
all the time.

649
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,070
Didn't you know?

650
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,431
They say they're so sensitive

651
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,676
they get sick
away from their kingdoms.

652
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,031
And they can even die of sadness.

653
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,515
All set.

654
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,028
Can I look?

655
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,075
Do you like it?

656
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,597
Do you think Manuel will like it?

657
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,713
He's no tightrope walker
but I like him a lot.

658
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,793
Maybe he's the one.

659
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,951
Can you imagine?
The man of my life.

660
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,478
I'd love to be
the woman of his life.

661
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,797
Even for just one day.

662
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,155
I want to ask you a favour, Zule.

663
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,034
It's really important to me.

664
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,516
Smell.

665
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,949
Perfume.

666
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,594
It was in the bathroom.

667
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,116
Adobe Premiere 5.1 .

668
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,033
It just came out.

669
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,509
And an Office upgrade.

670
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,832
I thought it was music.

671
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,753
It looks better on Zule.

672
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,716
She has bigger tits than me.

673
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,157
Guys like big tits, right?

674
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,351
Mine are pretty small.

675
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,515
They're normal.

676
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,669
Shall I get them done?

677
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,151
I'm saving up for implants.

678
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,792
How big do you like them?

679
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,469
Tell me.

680
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,439
I'll get the size you like.

681
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,551
The size of your hands.

682
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,791
So they'll fit nicely inside.

683
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,429
It's yours.

684
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,069
Would you like dessert?

685
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,358
Tonight I'm your dessert.

686
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,474
What's your other name?

687
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,629
You said you had two.

688
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,033
I can't tell you.

689
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,919
Why not?

690
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,911
It's my secret identity.

691
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,559
No one can know it.

692
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,079
Like Superman?

693
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,829
Something like that.

694
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,509
Are you a superhero?

695
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,874
A super heroine.

696
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,516
Which one?

697
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,392
It's dangerous.
No one can know

698
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,716
because they could hurt us.

699
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,349
You too.

700
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,309
I'm protecting you.

701
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,669
Thank you.

702
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,955
It's my job.

703
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,915
Do you change in phone booths,
like Superman?

704
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,668
Sometimes.

705
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,754
Do you have superpowers?

706
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,394
Can you fly?

707
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,909
Even better.

708
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,988
I can make you fly.

709
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,909
Manuel.

710
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,468
Would you pick me up?

711
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,235
Where?

712
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,999
After work.

713
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,389
Of course. Where?

714
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,068
Anywhere. Doesn't matter.
Would you?

715
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,196
Of course. What's wrong?

716
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,953
Nothing. Not anymore.

717
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,508
Don't wait for me.

718
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,434
What are you doing?

719
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,474
Is that guy paying you well?

720
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,715
Hey, I'm with someone.

721
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,514
Come party with us.
I'll pay you well.

722
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,114
Let go of me!

723
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,833
You got the wrong person.

724
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,031
100 euros to suck me off.

725
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,395
No, please, no.

726
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,715
Just a blowjob.

727
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,114
Not tonight, please.

728
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,797
Not tonight.

729
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,993
Then jerk me off.

730
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,316
Please.

731
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,677
Use your hand, like that.
I'll come real fast. I swear.

732
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,112
120. 120. Here.

733
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,475
-Not tonight, please.
-200 and I'll come real fast.

734
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,429
-No, please.
-I'll come real fast, I swear.

735
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,632
Come on, use your hand.
Use your hand, that's it.

736
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,829
Use your hand.

737
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,829
Like that. Squeeze it.

738
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,555
Suck my dick.

739
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,079
That's it.

740
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,673
I know everything.

741
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,559
You didn't go to the bathroom.

742
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,198
You went to save the world.

743
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,552
To stop a train from derailing.

744
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,231
You went, saved everyone,
and came back.

745
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,156
Am I right?

746
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,628
Are you okay?

747
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,638
Get the check, please.

748
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,835
I'm on my way out.

749
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,874
No hurry.

750
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,913
Stay there.

751
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,795
Excuse me.

752
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,318
My wife wants me to ask you
to please change the sheets

753
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,839
after sleeping in them.

754
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,515
Why doesn't she do it?

755
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,352
Because she's not the one who's
screwing 10 men a day in them.

756
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,436
She also told me to ask you
to leave the house before 8.

757
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,111
So that our son won't see you.

758
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,078
<i>My darling.</i>

759
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,474
<i>Star without a candle.</i>

760
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,000
<i>Blood of my wounds.</i>

761
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,473
<i>Don't make me suffer anymore.</i>

762
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,593
<i>My darling.</i>

763
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,353
<i>A stray bullet</i>

764
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,674
<i>on Main Street.</i>

765
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,550
<i>Puddle in the slums.</i>

766
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,159
<i>I don't want you to go.</i>

767
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,479
<i>I don't want you to go away.</i>

768
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,874
<i>More and more each day.</i>

769
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,879
<i>My darling.</i>

770
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,309
<i>Star without a candle.</i>

771
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,153
<i>My darling.</i>

772
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,679
<i>Little puddle of cloudy water.</i>

773
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,035
<i>Soap bubble.</i>

774
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,435
<i>My last refuge.</i>

775
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,988
<i>My last hope.</i>

776
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,589
Whore!

777
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,949
Fuck you!

778
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,236
<i>My darling.</i>

779
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,593
<i>Little puddle of cloudy water.</i>

780
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,676
<i>Soap bubble.</i>

781
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,440
<i>My last refuge.</i>

782
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,635
<i>My last hope.</i>

783
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,590
<i>I don't want you to go.</i>

784
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,108
<i>More and more each day.</i>

785
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,199
<i>My darling.</i>

786
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,828
You want some?

787
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,352
Something good from the Caribbean?

788
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,432
I'll give you 20.

789
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,029
No, 30. Come on.

790
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,590
Asshole!

791
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,360
Hey, guys. Looking for company?

792
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,875
Hello?

793
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,835
Good.

794
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,514
No, I can't.

795
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,275
Because I can't.

796
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,268
I don't believe you.

797
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,913
Because I don't.

798
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,157
<i>The guy's a piece of shit.
He doesn't have</i>

799
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,555
any papers for you.
He just wants to fuck you,

800
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,670
period.

801
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,796
He's taking them to the Cuesta.

802
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,556
Today?

803
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,149
At nine.

804
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,354
And you're going?

805
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,789
You said you'd go?

806
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,069
I don't know what to do.

807
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,879
He says they're valid
for 6 months.

808
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,389
Yeah, and he'll get you
an apartment.

809
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,875
He'll say anything.

810
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,274
Whatever you want to hear.

811
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,154
The guy's a pig.
He's out there fishing.

812
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,759
He's got ten others like you

813
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,632
who'll lose their shit for papers.

814
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,114
Yeah, I'll lose my shit.

815
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,553
You can't imagine what 6 months
would mean to me.

816
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,996
Don't go, all I'm saying
is don't go.

817
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,794
I'm the one getting
beaten, remember?

818
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,028
You can't let him beat you up
and then run back

819
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,559
for more when he calls.

820
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,957
What I can't do is stop going
out in the street.

821
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,317
Or go to see my son because
if I leave I can't get back in.

822
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,512
Your son needs a mother without
papers more than a dead one.

823
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,956
Don't tell me what my son needs.

824
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,559
You have no idea.

825
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,195
Zule!

826
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,076
<i>No, how can you think that, Mom?</i>

827
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,111
Everything's fine.

828
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,352
It's just that I thought about you.

829
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,508
Did you get the money I sent?

830
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,114
Did you get the money?

831
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,992
How's little Edward eating?

832
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,113
Is he eating well?

833
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,878
Don't give him sweets, Mom.

834
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,834
<i>Anyway, Mom. You too, take care.</i>

835
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,079
<i>I'll call again soon.</i>

836
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,308
<i>Talk to you soon.</i>

837
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,555
<i>Bye.</i>

838
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,069
How are you?

839
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,596
Water.

840
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,150
Another one.

841
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,869
Can I see them?

842
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,035
They've given me a lot of trouble.
You have no idea.

843
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,596
I needed a duplicate
with a signature...

844
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,114
And my friend in the registry,

845
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,435
he's not here.

846
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,519
He took a few days off.

847
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,269
Can I see them?

848
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,069
Did anyone see you?

849
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,678
Are you meeting anyone later?

850
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,959
I want to see my papers.

851
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,193
They're not yours.
Remember that.

852
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,549
Show them to me.

853
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,396
Not here.

854
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,279
Someone can see me.

855
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,159
Let's go to my place. We have time.
When are you going out?

856
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,352
Show them to me
and I'll go with you.

857
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,516
Hello?

858
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,069
Okay.

859
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,629
Yes.

860
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,914
Where?

861
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,555
Okay.

862
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,508
Okay.

863
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,029
Let's go.

864
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,875
Where?

865
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,115
I'll tell you outside.

866
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,313
Do you want your papers?

867
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,433
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

868
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,553
You have no other choice.

869
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,479
-Come on.
-Let go of me.

870
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,156
Walk ahead of me.

871
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,038
I'll tell you what to do.

872
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,395
Let go.

873
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,196
Take it easy!

874
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,873
I said let go!

875
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,156
Sorry I'm late.

876
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,351
Hi.

877
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,470
Did he bring them?

878
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:22,956
Who are you?

879
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,434
Caye, nice to meet you.

880
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,789
And you are?

881
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,069
He says at his place.

882
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,679
Great. Let's go.
Where do you live?

883
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,757
Just you. That's the deal.

884
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,830
Well?

885
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,279
I'll go up. She can wait downstairs.

886
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,199
In the street?

887
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,191
Just you.

888
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,948
I'll go up alone
and you get half an hour.

889
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,311
-Half an hour in the street?
-An hour!

890
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:48,756
Well?

891
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:51,836
Well?

892
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,510
Hey!

893
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,759
Son of a bitch.

894
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,828
The jerk treats me
like I stink or something.

895
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,348
lf you'd left with him,
anything could've happened.

896
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,837
But I'm left wondering.

897
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,554
Wondering what?

898
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,192
The usual.

899
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,832
Whether he had them or not.

900
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,559
It's unhygienic.

901
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,112
Whatever they say.
And it damages your hair.

902
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,353
And you don't do them.

903
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,477
I know how.
I don't on principle.

904
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,355
I didn't say you don't know how,
I said you don't do them.

905
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,755
On principle.

906
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,433
The hairdresser's principle?

907
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,029
Hairdressers have principles?

908
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,713
Like you and everyone else.

909
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,559
You don't screw without a condom,
I don't do braids.

910
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,434
I don't out of common sense,
not principles.

911
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,670
Very bad. You should
do it out of principle.

912
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,348
What's the difference?

913
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,709
It's not the same.

914
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,837
You can not do something
for many reasons.

915
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,268
There's a big difference.

916
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,911
You look black. Who did these?

917
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,873
You're a traitor, Caye.

918
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:26,956
They're comfortable.

919
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,549
And I get twice as much work.

920
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,234
They don't look good on you.
I have to tell you that.

921
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,635
She has to tell you
that on principle.

922
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,593
Right. On principle.

923
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,236
Because it's my job.

924
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,556
You think principles
come free with condoms.

925
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,352
But either you have them or not.

926
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,916
Not like tits which you can get
if you don't have them.

927
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,511
I'm gonna charge
for touching my hair.

928
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,078
Let's give them a fright.

929
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,470
What are you doing?

930
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,352
It's my job. They're taking it away.

931
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,788
Is this the police?

932
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,951
Some black girls are fighting.

933
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,832
Providencia Street. In the square.

934
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,276
Africans. Look like whores to me.

935
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,189
She's faking it.

936
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,355
No, she's really calling.

937
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,833
A neighbour.

938
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,279
Three minutes. Thanks.

939
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,596
Thanks.

940
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,594
How can you be like that?

941
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,270
What about them?
I'm defending what's mine.

942
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,996
Hi, girls.

943
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,309
Can I use your bathroom?

944
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,475
It's still broken.

945
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,869
Just for a minute.

946
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:36,830
It's broken.

947
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,317
Fuck, Gloria, I won't mess it up!

948
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,875
Come to my place, if you want.
I'm heading that way.

949
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,235
Cool!

950
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,074
See you later.

951
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,194
To the right, Blanca.

952
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,029
30, my love.

953
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,948
In a hotel, 30.

954
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,794
Of course.

955
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,359
No, my love, 30.

956
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,798
You won't forget it.

957
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,594
You'll want to be my boyfriend.

958
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,829
Tell me, my love.

959
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,115
Okay.

960
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:17,875
Okay.

961
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,991
<i>Okay, ciao, my love.</i>

962
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,594
Who's Zulema?

963
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,150
Are you Zulema?

964
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,311
Caye says come right away.
It's really important.

965
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,878
Come straight over.

966
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,479
She's on the corner.

967
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,309
Is something wrong?

968
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,074
That's all she told me to say.

969
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:43,790
What?

970
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,196
What's up?

971
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,799
What's up with you?

972
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,352
What's up with your friend?

973
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,795
I saw you talking to him.

974
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,274
I wanted to know if you were okay.

975
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,510
Are you okay?

976
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,436
Like always.

977
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,155
Come to my place?

978
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,635
We're going to her bathroom.
Gloria's is broken.

979
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,439
Lucky you weren't there.

980
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,518
Fuck, you're right.

981
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,756
lf it wasn't for Caye,
they'd have busted you.

982
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,870
You knew, didn't you?

983
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,752
You knew and sent her.

984
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,511
Who?

985
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,877
They're the ones who called.

986
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,592
It was Angela. She's not working.

987
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,678
She says it's because of you.

988
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,029
The bitches!

989
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,198
She wouldn't listen to me.

990
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,998
That's the way things are.

991
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,428
Maybe for you, not for me.

992
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,712
Try to understand.
Before she had a lot of work.

993
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,399
Why did you warn me then?

994
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,113
Don't I take away her work?

995
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,435
You're my friend.

996
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,830
So why didn't you come yourself?

997
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,070
You save her and she complains!

998
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,755
Unbelievable!

999
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,432
They should have taken her too.

1000
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,873
And fucked her up.

1001
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:00,834
Do you have Chanel?

1002
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:01,797
Perfume?

1003
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,509
Can I try it?

1004
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,077
Thank you.

1005
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,868
Smells great.

1006
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,072
It's number 5, right?

1007
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,799
Can I try a little more?

1008
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,070
You weren't here last month,
were you? A little more.

1009
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,396
Thank you.

1010
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,189
Can I see the bottle?

1011
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,910
They make them so pretty now.

1012
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,597
<i>If life gives you</i>

1013
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,515

1043
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,515
No, please.

1044
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,994
Take it easy.

1045
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,515
Take it easy.

1046
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,509
Please.

1047
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,669
Where are you going?

1048
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,470
Stay.

1049
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:40,115
lf I see you around here again,
I'll call the police.

1050
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,508
Yes?

1051
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,193
How many are you?

1052
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,234
Two?

1053
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,398
Together, 100.

1054
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,992
100. 50 per head.

1055
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,030
50.

1056
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,233
Where are you?

1057
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,396
Caye!

1058
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,553
You work around here?

1059
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,792
Across the street.

1060
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,113
Caye...

1061
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,635
Friends of mine from work.

1062
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:58,797
Hi.

1063
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,235
Hello.

1064
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:04,670
How are you?

1065
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,037
Fine.

1066
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:07,756
Like always.

1067
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,828
I'm meeting someone.

1068
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:10,797
Here?

1069
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,630
A friend.

1070
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,635
Manuel.

1071
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:17,836
I'll be right back.

1072
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,156
He's the one
that gives me the software.

1073
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,510
What about you?

1074
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,790
Me?

1075
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,468
They have liqueurs inside,
they're my favourites.

1076
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,558
That means he knows you well.

1077
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,390
I prefer flowers,
they're less fattening.

1078
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,079
Have one, Caye.

1079
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,998
The red ones are delicious.

1080
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,635
Next week we have to go see Dad.

1081
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,830
Well, Mom?

1082
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,958
I don't know if I'm going.

1083
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,556
Why?

1084
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,794
It's inconvenient.

1085
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,752
Anyway, he won't know.

1086
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,518
But we go every year.

1087
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,556
That's another reason. lf I don't
go this time it doesn't matter.

1088
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,911
And I don't want to talk about it.

1089
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,154
But we have to talk about it

1090
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,117
and decide how to do it.

1091
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,918
And we have to take flowers.

1092
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,837
Anyone know a florist?

1093
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,437
Mom?

1094
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,952
You could get them.

1095
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,118
Maybe they'll give you a discount.

1096
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,119
I don't understand you.

1097
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,828
Obviously you don't.

1098
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,673
I don't understand you either.

1099
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,912
<i>There's a day, you'll see.</i>

1100
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,878
<i>One awesome day.</i>

1101
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,758
<i>On that day
everything Is good.</i>

1102
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,231
<i>You see the people
you want to see,</i>

1103
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,398
<i>eat your favourite food,</i>

1104
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,797
<i>and everything that happens
Is what you want to happen.</i>

1105
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,990
<i>If you turn on the radio,
your favourite song Is playing.</i>

1106
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,160
<i>If you go on a TV game show,</i>

1107
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,913
<i>you win everything.</i>

1108
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,760
<i>Money, trips... everything.</i>

1109
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,352
<i>Mark my words...</i>

1110
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,034
<i>everything.</i>

1111
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,552
<i>It happens once in a lifetime,
so you have to be ready.</i>

1112
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,318
<i>Or you'll miss It.</i>

1113
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,193
<i>It's like a detour.</i>

1114
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:50,672
<i>Like when you're on a road
and come to a detour</i>

1115
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,797
<i>but you're talking on your cell</i>

1116
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,349
<i>or arguing or thinking
about something</i>

1117
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,312
<i>and don't realize
and you miss It</i>

1118
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,988
<i>and you're screwed
because you can't turn back.</i>

1119
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,077
Well, that day is the same thing:

1120
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,309
<i>a detour.</i>

1121
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:18,549
<i>And you can choose how things
will be from that day on.</i>

1122
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,110
<i>Either you take the new route,
or you don't.</i>

1123
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,114
<i>That's why we have
to be ready, Zule.</i>

1124
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:28,318
<i>There are too few
good things in life.</i>

1125
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,868
<i>And If you miss them because you're
thinking about something else,</i>

1126
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,113
<i>that would suck.</i>

1127
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,832
<i>That would really suck.</i>

1128
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,709
<i>They call me Caye,
walking the street.</i>

1129
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,036
<i>The mischievous, the oh-so-lost.</i>

1130
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:52,835
<i>They call me street.
Street by night, street by day.</i>

1131
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,958
<i>They call me street,
today so tired, today so empty.</i>

1132
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,119
<i>Like a little machine
walking the big city.</i>

1133
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,789
<i>They call me street,
I get in your car,</i>

1134
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,070
<i>they call me street
of joy and sorrow,</i>

1135
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,875
<i>aching street, tired street
from so much loving.</i>

1136
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,594
<i>I go down the street, up the street,</i>

1137
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,030
<i>I won't come down,
not even for life.</i>

1138
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,629
<i>They call me street
and I'm proud of It.</i>

1139
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,910
<i>I know my day will come.</i>

1140
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,634
<i>Luck will find me some day.</i>

1141
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,035
<i>One day he'll be there
to pick me up,</i>

1142
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,351
<i>after work, that good man,</i>

1143
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,909
<i>my lifelong love
who won't need to pay.</i>

1144
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,350
<i>My heart's not for rent.</i>

1145
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,352
<i>They call me street.</i>

1146
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,592
<i>They call me street.</i>

1147
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,188
<i>Suffering Street,
Sad Street from so much loving.</i>

1148
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,111
<i>They call me street.</i>

1149
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,677
<i>Street and street.</i>

1150
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,038
Are you going to charge yours?

1151
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,072
Tonight we're not whores.

1152
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,078
Tonight we're princesses.

1153
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,190
EXOTlC AFRlCAN BRAlDS

1154
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,789
You must teach us
how to walk like you.

1155
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,957
Maybe then we'll get more work.

1156
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:48,949
There are ways...

1157
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,270
But you have to start
when you're young.

1158
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,197
Was it scary on the raft?

1159
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,868
You don't have to use
sign language, Caren.

1160
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,278
And people come
from America by plane.

1161
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,589
I flew into Holland.

1162
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,713
From there I came down here.

1163
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,871
Rosa, you can help her out.

1164
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,156
With her papers. You have contacts.

1165
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,078
Rosa has screwed ministers.

1166
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,278
And gone to parties
and seen all kinds of things.

1167
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,759
Why don't you call someone?

1168
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,079
It's not the way things are done.

1169
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,514
And it's a load of bull.

1170
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,115
Tell us one name.

1171
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,078
Just one name that we can believe.

1172
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,835
I can't.

1173
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,315
Because you're lying.

1174
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,877
I can't.
I signed a contract.

1175
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:31,957
Really?

1176
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,318
A non-disclosure form.

1177
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:37,875
They made you sign?

1178
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,548
And they always frisk me before,
just in case.

1179
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:41,909
He's that important?

1180
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,669
One day I'll bring it
and you'll be sorry.

1181
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,473
The phantom menace.

1182
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,432
She's said it so many times.

1183
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,478
Know what their problem is?

1184
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,272
They haven't travelled like us.

1185
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,515
What do you expect?

1186
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:55,516
Where are you from?

1187
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,075
The Dominican Republic.
Boca Chica.

1188
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,111
I'll see what I can do.

1189
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,630
While you're at it, can you check
my business license too?

1190
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,831
Somebody wants you, Zule.

1191
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,629
Can you take over?

1192
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,229
I'll give it a try.

1193
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,995
She's all right.

1194
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,069
You don't come from
Santo Domingo on a raft, Caren.

1195
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,516
It's in America.

1196
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,516
I know.

1197
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,069
I got nervous.

1198
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,430
What's that?

1199
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,353
It belongs to my friends.

1200
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,149
Are you here alone?

1201
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,469
I'm with you.

1202
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:05,915
You like it?

1203
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,070
Very much.

1204
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,949
<i>It's sancocho.</i>

1205
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:15,629
We cook it for our boyfriends
as a sign of commitment.

1206
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,753
I'm kidding.

1207
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,997
Why do you work in the van?

1208
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,309
It's not work. I'm a volunteer.

1209
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,633
I'm still a student.

1210
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,273
Then why do you do it?

1211
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,115
I like it.

1212
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,753
I like you girls.

1213
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,631
Well, some more than others.

1214
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,474
A volunteer...

1215
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:03,868
How lucky.

1216
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:09,990
Just when I needed one.

1217
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,632
Turned out tasty.

1218
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,160
We have to leave at 8, volunteer.
I can't explain.

1219
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,309
Gently.

1220
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,950
<i>Gently, papa, please.</i>

1221
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,154
What's wrong?

1222
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,032
It's difficult for me.

1223
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,039
Vallejo, Zulema?

1224
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,315
Yes?

1225
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,192
When they come out, you can go in.

1226
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,388
I went for some tests.

1227
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,109
What kind?

1228
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:03,910
Everything.

1229
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:10,949
How's Manuel?

1230
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,835
The same.

1231
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,957
Sometimes I get carried away.

1232
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,709
We're taking a little time off.

1233
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:26,755
And your volunteer?

1234
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,034
Just as bad.

1235
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,917
Did you know that the sea here
is very important?

1236
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:58,990
There's no sea here.

1237
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,789
Exactly.

1238
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,036
That's why everyone
thinks so much about it.

1239
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,279
Things are not important
because they exist,

1240
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,557
but because people
think about them.

1241
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,390
Like your son.

1242
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,755
He's not here but you think
about him every day, don't you?

1243
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,233
That's why he exists.

1244
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,358
Because you think about him.

1245
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,192
That's what my mother says.

1246
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,192
We exist because someone thinks
about us, not vice versa.

1247
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,397
She says someone said it,

1248
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,237
but I think she made it up.

1249
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,275
She makes everything up,
when it's convenient.

1250
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,193
Actually, I...

1251
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,592
I don't believe in God much,

1252
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,396
and I'm not religious or anything.

1253
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,354
My mother is,

1254
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,349
but I'm not.

1255
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,548
The only thing is...

1256
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,392
I've been thinking, you know...

1257
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,833
And I think that...

1258
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,552
Well, the worst thing isn't...

1259
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,598
wouldn't be if there was
nothing after death.

1260
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,910
The worst thing would be
if there was another life.

1261
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,752
Another life like this one.

1262
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,559
Zulema Vallejo.

1263
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,990
Go through. The doctor
will be with you shortly.

1264
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,553
Where are my results?

1265
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,513
They'll bring them now.

1266
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,278
<i>Make sure she looks great.</i>

1267
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:56,354
She has to knock them
off their feet when they see her.

1268
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,708
Are you glad about leaving?

1269
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,118
I'd like to leave too.

1270
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,833
And open an eating house.

1271
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,268
Yeah, a cock-eating house.

1272
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,033
Hey, I'd be great at it.

1273
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:15,152
And Mamen would come with me.
Wouldn't you, Mamen?

1274
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:16,629
What's this?

1275
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,958
I can't believe it.

1276
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,989
It's too much!

1277
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,189
What a bitch!

1278
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,595
Unbelievable! incredible!

1279
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,750
How fancy!

1280
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:44,710
I knew it!

1281
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,429
How cool!

1282
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,590
Well, I never!

1283
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,709
How fancy!

1284
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,274
Where did that car come from?

1285
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,435
It's for me while I'm waiting,
to take me shopping.

1286
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,949
Cool!

1287
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:14,668
Want to go for a ride?

1288
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,478
There's no room for me.

1289
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,075
This is great!

1290
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,913
The ladies are my friends, Joaquin.

1291
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,599
Did she screw him here, Joaquin?

1292
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,394
Some oil tycoon gave the Princess
of Monaco a car like this.

1293
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,034
I heard it on the radio.

1294
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,559
Put down the windows
so they can see us.

1295
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,954
Where to, madam?

1296
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,515
Let's go to the park
so the girls can see us.

1297
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,312
Neli, go to the park. You'll flip.

1298
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,793
I'm with Joaquin,

1299
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,479
a friend of mine.

1300
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:00,075
Go to Alameda
and we'll pick you up.

1301
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,397
Mom, look out the window.

1302
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,589
Secret documents!

1303
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:04,789
Wow!

1304
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,674
Angela, put that down.

1305
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,757
It's top secret.

1306
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,388
We won't wrinkle them.

1307
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,589
Caren, stop it.

1308
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:13,477
''Confidential''!

1309
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:14,755
Put it down.

1310
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:23,399
Joaquin, who is Rosa seeing
and won't tell us about?

1311
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,518
I have to be with my son.

1312
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,918
After that, I don't know.

1313
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,113
I might come back someday.

1314
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:03,029
It's normal.

1315
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:05,278
That's your kingdom, Zule.

1316
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,954
Princesses can't live away
from their kingdoms.

1317
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:12,077
They're so sensitive
they die of nostalgia.

1318
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,196
I told you once, remember?

1319
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,512
It happens to me sometimes.

1320
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,795
I miss things
that haven't happened yet.

1321
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,109
It's yours.

1322
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,115
So I'm giving it to you.

1323
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,149
It's for your operation.

1324
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:38,989
It scares me.

1325
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,352
Besides, Manuel's right.

1326
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:44,353
I'm weird.
I'd probably self-reject.

1327
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:48,918
And if you self-reject,
the sooner the better, right?

1328
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,392
Remember me, okay?

1329
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,790
We exist because someone thinks
about us, not vice versa.

1330
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,358
Never forget that.

1331
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,039
Of course, baby.

1332
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,117
We'll see each other really soon.

1333
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,794
Really soon.

1334
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,473
I'm bringing you a present.

1335
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,509
A present.

1336
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,992
I can't tell you.

1337
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,594
It's a surprise.

1338
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,079
Don't wait around, okay?

1339
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:51,875
Okay.

1340
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,632
Maybe today's the day.

1341
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,430
The day of the detour, remember?

1342
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,753
The one you said
we have to be ready for.

1343
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:17,795
Maybe it's today.

1344
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,589
My friend. She's leaving
because she wants to.

1345
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,110
Excuse me?

1346
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,673
She's leaving.

1347
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,434
No one's kicking her out.
She wants to be with her son.

1348
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:12,515
Great.

1349
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:14,508
That's all.

1350
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:24,191
<i>If life gives you</i>

1351
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:27,229
<i>more than five reasons to go on.</i>

1352
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:29,391
<i>If life gives you</i>

1353
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,354
<i>more than five corners to sleep in.</i>

1354
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:33,999
<i>If life gives you</i>

1355
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,870
<i>more than five million to die...</i>

1356
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,230
<i>You strain yourself.</i>

1357
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,478
<i>Night and day.</i>

1358
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,475
The check, Jose.

1359
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,075
How are you?

1360
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,110
Great.

1361
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:48,919
I met a boy, you know?

1362
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,799
We're seeing each other.

1363
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,150
Good for you.
Where did you find him?

1364
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,833
At the methadone clinic.

1365
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,475
He's great.

1366
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,473
He holds my hand and everything.

1367
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,757
And calls me ''sweetheart.''

1368
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,874
The first day I almost
slugged him, but now,

1369
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,355
I'm used to it.

1370
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:10,396
You know what I'm sorry about?

1371
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,153
That I didn't meet him before,

1372
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,509
when I was whole.

1373
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,431
Because I was really hot.

1374
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,075
Really hot.

1375
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:20,350
Anyway.

1376
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,152
He missed it.

1377
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,630
Well...

1378
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,034
That's his fault.

1379
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:30,912
He should've showed up sooner.

1380
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:38,755
Cool.

1381
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,269
The jerk.

1382
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,118
He should've showed up sooner.

1383
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,035
I'll tell him that.

1384
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,668
Here.

1385
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,630
By the way,

1386
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:52,869
the bathroom looks great.

1387
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:54,356
Cool.

1388
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,039
About fucking time, Jose.

1389
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:58,231
It's been broken for over a year.

1390
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,198
Maybe I'll buy one too.

1391
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,159
No one calls the other phone.

1392
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,557
That's not because
of the phone.

1393
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,155
Who knows?

1394
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:24,953
Being so expensive,

1395
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,673
more people might call.

1396
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:28,833
And they can call when I'm out.

1397
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,075
But you never go out.

1398
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:31,992
It would get me out.

1399
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,756
To test it, see if anyone calls.

1400
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,912
Can you hear well with this one?

1401
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,274
They all sound the same.

1402
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,315
You haven't had
any flowers lately.

1403
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,797
He must be on vacation.

1404
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:07,269
How's Zulema?

1405
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:13,795
What?

1406
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,508
Zulema. How is she?

1407
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,156
She left.

1408
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,035
To her country?

1409
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,109
This morning.

1410
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:25,988
On vacation?

1411
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,198
She couldn't take it anymore.

1412
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:34,754
She couldn't.

1413
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:37,119
She was a whore...

1414
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,232
and she couldn't take it anymore.

1415
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:47,395
And she had some guy after her.

1416
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,436
Some asshole who had it in for her.

1417
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:53,954
So she left.

1418
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,471
She wanted to be with her family.

1419
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,432
How did you meet her?

1420
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,878
Once I took her to the hospital.

1421
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,718
The guy had beat her up.

1422
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,035
Until today.

1423
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,868
Until today.

1424
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,238
I don't want any more.

1425
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:56,995
Caye!

1426
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,433
Caye, your phone!

1427
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:07,835
Caye!

1428
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,512
You answer it, Mom!

1429
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,194
<i>They call me Caye,
walking the street.</i>

1430
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,755
<i>The mischievous, the oh-so-lost.</i>

1431
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:56,873
<i>They call me street.
Street by night, street by day.</i>

1432
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:01,997
<i>They call me street,
today so tired, today so empty.</i>

1433
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,919
<i>Like a little machine
walking the big city.</i>

1434
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,429
<i>They call me street,
I get in your car,</i>

1435
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:09,915
<i>they call me street
of joy and sorrow,</i>

1436
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:13,669
<i>aching street, tired street
from so much loving.</i>

1437
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,228
<i>I go down the street, up the street,</i>

1438
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,590
<i>I won't come down,
not even for life.</i>

1439
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:22,075
<i>They call me street
and I'm proud of It.</i>

1440
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,475
<i>I know my day will come.</i>

1441
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:27,148
<i>Luck will find me someday.</i>

1442
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,555
<i>One day he'll be there
to pick me up,</i>

1443
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,990
<i>after work, that good man,</i>

1444
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,350
<i>my lifelong love
who won't need to pay.</i>

1445
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,869
<i>My heart's not for rent.</i>

1446
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,638
<i>They call me street.</i>

1447
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,998
<i>They call me street.</i>

1448
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,754
<i>Suffering Street,
Sad Street from so much loving.</i>

1449
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,478
<i>They call me street.</i>

1450
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:51,151
<i>Street and street.</i>

1451
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,954
<i>They call me street, the daredevil.</i>

1452
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:56,469
<i>They call me street
from corner to corner.</i>

1453
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:58,955
<i>They call me street,
