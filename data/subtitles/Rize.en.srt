1
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,470
Six days of rioting in a Negro
section of Los Angeles...

2
00:00:53,522 --> 00:00:57,099
left behind scenes reminiscent
of war-torn cities.

3
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,851
More than
a hundred square blocks...

4
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,519
were decimated
by fire and looters.

5
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,813
Civil rights leaders
were quick to deplore...

6
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,815
the unbridled lawlessness...

7
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:08,068
and Martin Luther King vowed
to do all in his power...

8
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,280
to prevent a reoccurrence
in Los Angeles or anywhere.

9
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,426
This is our neighborhood.

10
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,929
This is where we grew up.

11
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,101
We were all kids back then
when this happened...

12
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,523
but we managed to grow
from these ashes.

13
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,076
And this is
where we still live.

14
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,241
Well, if you're drowning
and there's nothing around...

15
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,243
for help
but a board floating...

16
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,495
you're gonna reach out
for that board.

17
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,080
And this was our board.

18
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,880
And from this board...

19
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,914
we floated abroad,
and we built us a big ship.

20
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,011
And we're gonna sail into
the dance world, the art world.

21
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,055
We're gonna take it by storm
because it's our belief.

22
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,057
This is not a trend.
Let me repeat.

23
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,018
This is not a trend.

24
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,290
You better give me a hug.
Give me a hug.

25
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,959
I need a hug.
Give me a hug.

26
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,418
You don't have to dance.

27
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,462
I want a hug from
a pretty girl like you.

28
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,215
You are so pretty.
Come here, girl.

29
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,886
How'd it get started?

30
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,390
Tommy started it in '92. 1992.

31
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,225
He started off
by hisself at first.

32
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:10,008
What's up, baby?

33
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,646
Come on, you guys.
You guys ready to party?

34
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,773
When he first started out,
he had a little black bucket...

35
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,192
and had his little sign
on the side.

36
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,945
He was just starting out,
but he's come a long way.

37
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,030
All you hear is,
"Tommy, Tommy dancing.

38
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,324
"Tommy this. Tommy that.
I wanna go to Tommy Academy."

39
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,524
I have a ten-year-old son...

40
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,578
that's trying to get
into the academy.

41
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,528
So I think
that it's wonderful...

42
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,832
and he needs to keep up
the good work...

43
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,917
and he needs to be commended for
the things that he's doing...

44
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,335
for the black community,
Hispanics.

45
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,920
He has marvelous parties...

46
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,298
so somebody need to call
and give a party...

47
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,426
'cause he give bomb parties.

48
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,345
Tommy is a ghetto celebrity,
'cause you're gonna see Tommy...

49
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,097
somewhere
in your neighborhood...

50
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,100
in the middle of your streets,
waking you up...

51
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:51,935
because his music gonna be loud.

52
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:56,231
When my mom was in jail,
he took me in...

53
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,890
and he made sure
I got to school.

54
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,904
Whatever I needed,
he made sure I was OK.

55
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,238
If I wasn't dancing for Tommy...

56
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,115
I'd probably be doing
some bad things right now.

57
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,700
I fear for him sometimes,
though...

58
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,327
'cause a lot of people
are jealous...

59
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,870
and they're
really hatin' on him.

60
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,206
If something happened to him,
we'd all be right there.

61
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,749
We all gonna suffer.

62
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,250
He screams at us.

63
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,127
He screams, "You in trouble."

64
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,380
He basically,
you know, like a father.

65
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,581
He was really there for me.

66
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,677
And I admire him for that.
I love him for that.

67
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,682
See how you powder like that?

68
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,143
Then you got to get the lips.
You don't want it to smear.

69
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:34,436
So...

70
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,949
Yep. And that's it.

71
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,034
Once I put the powder on...

72
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:54,540
then you try to dust off some
of the white of the powder...

73
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,917
and there you have it.

74
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,419
Your color come back.

75
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,994
People always
used to say I act crazy.

76
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,121
I always did silly things.

77
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,039
And this girl,
just out of the blue...

78
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,000
asked can I be a clown
at her birthday party.

79
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,459
And I was, like, "A clown?"

80
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,679
I pull up to
the neighborhood, jump out.

81
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,265
I start dancing,
walking on my hands, flippin'.

82
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,474
Kids would run out the houses.

83
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,684
People would run out the houses.

84
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,102
And I'll give 'em a card.

85
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,396
"If you need a clown
for your birthday party...

86
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,648
"call Tommy the Clown,
the hip-hop dancing clown."

87
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,296
And it start spreadin'.

88
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:04,850
Happy birthday, Malik!

89
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,852
Y'all ready
to party with Malik...

90
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,906
- somebody say, "That's right."
- That's right!

91
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,856
Y'all ready to have
some fun with Malik...

92
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,535
- say, "You know this, man."
- You know this, man!

93
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,121
Everybody go and give Malik
some birthday hits.

94
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,373
I'm just playin'.
I'm just playin'.

95
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,753
I'm just playin'. Y'all stop.
Y'all better back up.

96
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,631
You have to remember.
I created this on my own.

97
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,883
I started from the ground up.

98
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,094
No one offered me no money.
No one gave me a dime.

99
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:34,264
But I'm perceived to be
the richest man on Earth...

100
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:36,183
and ain't got a dime.

101
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,101
You ready for that?

102
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,939
Let me see you break it down.

103
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,941
You ain't gonna break it down?

104
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,943
Back in the days,
I had my share...

105
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:50,072
of being, I guess you
can say, a drug dealer...

106
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:54,117
coming out here and
gettin' involved with drugs.

107
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,953
I came out here
to become big time...

108
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:57,371
because I saved my money...

109
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,832
and was like one
of the big drug dealers...

110
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,834
where I got
my nice cars and stuff.

111
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,752
And I always liked
to show off...

112
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,129
to say, "Man, look what
I have gotten," you know?

113
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:07,506
That was back then.

114
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,883
I always say God
gave me the opportunity...

115
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,135
'cause either you end up
shot, dead, and killed...

116
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,679
or you go to jail.

117
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,722
And thank God
that I went to jail.

118
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,255
And when I went to jail...

119
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,810
I said, "This is not
the place for me"...

120
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:21,186
and I changed my life.

121
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,981
I prayed. I asked God
to give me another chance.

122
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,942
I didn't know
I was saving kids' lives.

123
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,194
But if you look at it,
yes, you are...

124
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,405
'cause that kid
come dance with you...

125
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,364
who wouldn't dance with you...

126
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,074
and you were straight
to that kid.

127
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,994
"Hey, I catch you in a gang,
you are in trouble.

128
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:39,230
"If I catch you
even claiming anything...

129
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:41,415
"I don't want you
to wear them colors."

130
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,458
And they listen to me,
and they do it.

131
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,189
So I guess you could say
that saved his life...

132
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,879
because if they would've
wore that color...

133
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,881
they would've went over
to that neighborhood...

134
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,841
they would've got shot,
they would've been dead.

135
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:52,801
It's the bottom line.

136
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,636
Everybody say break it down

137
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,596
Break it down

138
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,638
Say, "Break it down"

139
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,598
Break it down

140
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,682
Say, "Break it down"

141
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,058
Break it down

142
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,060
Bam. OK, it's about to get down,
y'all. Check this out.

143
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,985
As I started gettin' older...

144
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,446
I started lookin'
at the way these kids dance...

145
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,979
and I started grabbin' 'em.

146
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,982
I had another girl,
another guy...

147
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,453
and then it just started
spreading like that.

148
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,813
Larry is, like...

149
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,982
one of the oldest
clown members that I have.

150
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:32,109
I consider him
to be my right-hand man...

151
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,403
'cause he been with me
through day one.

152
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,326
Tommy is
a father figure to Larry.

153
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,245
Sometimes, when Larry
get off the ringer...

154
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,122
and have the attitudes
and be way-out crazed...

155
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:46,874
I say, "OK, that's it."
That's my threat.

156
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,000
See, that's my weapon... Tommy.

157
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,877
I say, "OK, that's it.
Let me get the phone.

158
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,962
"Let me call Tommy right now,
see now what time it is.

159
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:53,005
"No more clowning for you."

160
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,591
I say, "OK, Tommy,
your son is off the ringer."

161
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,010
So I tell him now. Tommy say,
"Yeah, I wanna talk to Larry."

162
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,096
I say, "Well, that's your son.
Holler at him."

163
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,099
'Cause to tell the truth,
he has more control.

164
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,643
Tommy have Larry in the palm
of his hands right now.

165
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,438
I have been
Larry dad for a long time...

166
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,190
to where if he's slippin'
in school and grades...

167
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,733
I have to smash on him
and let him know...

168
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,110
"Hey, come here and do
your homework, homie"...

169
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,486
and if you get to where I say...

170
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,655
"Hey, you can't clown
this weekend and next week"...

171
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:19,771
it hurts, you know?

172
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,033
'Cause they love to do it.

173
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,955
Hey, I want him to be a Blood
or I want him to be a Crip...

174
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,750
"No, I'm not gonna be either.
I wanna be a Clown."

175
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,251
That's how
he separated hisself...

176
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,337
from all the bullcrap
out here in Holly-Watts.

177
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,965
Most of my family is, like,
on this block, city of Watts.

178
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,511
Man, we... we right here
in the... in the lion's den...

179
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,845
the pit of snakes.

180
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,847
What's up, Little George?

181
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:44,890
This is my little brother
Little George.

182
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:45,849
Come here, George.

183
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,799
We have all the gangs
on one side...

184
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,728
and then you have the Clowns
on the other side.

185
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,939
They gonna ask you,
"Who do you dance with?"

186
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,107
Or they gonna be, like,
"What set you from?"

187
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,109
So that's why it's either
a gang or a clown group.

188
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:00,531
Dance with a clown group,
they go on about their business.

189
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,575
They go about their business,
don't bother you too much.

190
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,370
Larry is over here
with the clowns.

191
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,163
I thank God for that.

192
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,832
George, when you gonna
start dancin'?

193
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,835
You know it's like
a family tradition.

194
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,659
Granny used to be a clown, too.

195
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,995
I'm so glad they came out
with this clown thing...

196
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,299
'cause ain't no tellin' where
the kids would really be...

197
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,009
or what would they be doing.

198
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,636
What else is there to do?

199
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,430
The clown thing
is a big part of L.A.

200
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,598
Everybody want to be a clown.

201
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,642
Everybody... everybody's
into the clownin'.

202
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,894
What is a clown group?

203
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,583
A clown group is...

204
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,179
Birthday parties.

205
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,775
How do I put it?
A clown group is...

206
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,350
Makin' people happy.

207
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,362
Is a group of people
entertaining...

208
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,656
Makin' smiles where
there were no smiles...

209
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,189
laughter where
there was no laughter.

210
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,952
See, a lot of clown groups
don't have the entertainment.

211
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,621
You can't just go out there
and just dance, dance, dance.

212
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,915
People don't wanna see that.
They wanna see a show.

213
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,417
You have to, like,
love doin' it.

214
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:54,751
You can't just say...

215
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,879
"Uh, I'm gonna do it
'cause I know how to dance."

216
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,922
It's, like, something
you have to have love for.

217
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,237
It's like a getaway.
You know what I mean?

218
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,510
You get to travel
from here to there...

219
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,095
see, meet different people.

220
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,640
And some people don't even
get out their own neighborhood.

221
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,102
People say, "Why you still
dancin' with Tommy the Clown?"

222
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,218
You know what I'm sayin'?

223
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,813
Because I want to.
I like to do this.

224
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,315
I been doin' this
since I was 12.

225
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,390
I'm 18 now, you know?

226
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,652
So I'm gettin' older,
and I like entertaining.

227
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,612
You know what I'm saying?

228
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,113
This is one of my dreams
I wanna pursue...

229
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,114
is to be an entertainer.

230
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:27,075
I can do my dance thing.
I can be funny.

231
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:31,246
I can make people laugh.
I can meet new people.

232
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,750
I can...

233
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,410
make myself a name
to where people know who I am...

234
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:43,800
and give me my respect for just
doing something positive...

235
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,553
and not going negative.

236
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,764
'Cause if I wasn't doin'
this clown shit...

237
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,933
I honestly think
I'd have probably been...

238
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,394
a very, very, very bad person.

239
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,521
Yo, Tommy.

240
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:00,067
Would you happen
to remember Celestine?

241
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,402
No. Who is this?

242
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,321
I told you he don't remember.

243
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,532
No. How you doin'?
I remember you.

244
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,575
- What you been up to, girl?
- Nothin'.

245
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,576
When they let you out of jail?

246
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,328
Oh, this ain't...

247
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,039
Oh, my bad. I thought...
Ain't this the one?

248
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,041
Well, she look like her.

249
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,252
I wanna see you...

250
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,795
Go, shorty

251
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,046
It's your birthday

252
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,298
We gonna party
like it's your birthday

253
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,175
We gonna sip Bacardi like...

254
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:26,218
Hold on, baby. Hold on.

255
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,597
No. No, baby. We not gonna
sip no Bacardi, sweetheart.

256
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,625
- Blow it out.
- I know it hurts.

257
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,773
That's all right.
That's all right.

258
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:45,816
And we gonna sing it for you...

259
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:46,775
Let it out.

260
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,236
Right here, right now.

261
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,613
And it goes
a little somethin' like this.

262
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,074
Happy birthday

263
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,774
dear Liza

264
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:56,869
Oh, yes, indeed

265
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,412
I don't need y'all to clap

266
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,581
'Cause we know we can sing, yeah

267
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,749
I'm not talkin' to you... ou... ou

268
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,587
Y'all better clap.
That's the end of the song.

269
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,884
How many clown groups are there?

270
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,429
You have House of Clowns.

271
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,556
This is Homeboy the Clown
Entertainment right here.

272
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:18,932
Cartoonz Clowns.

273
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,309
This is
Hard 'N' the Paint Clowns.

274
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,102
Check it out.
This is that one and only...

275
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:23,854

00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:27,024
World Wide Clowns.
Y-K Clowns.

277
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,306
Get Em Up Clowns.

278
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:31,820
We were Get Em Up Clowns.
Now it's Get Em Up Soldiers.

279
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,323
Just Clownin'. Platinum Clowns.

280
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,825
What's up?
There's No Comparison.

281
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,452
We're Nan Nutta.

282
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:39,620
Big X, you know what I'm sayin'?

283
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,539
A.k.a. Cereal Man,
you know, Froot Loop Man.

284
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,082
You know what I'm sayin'?

285
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,334
Rice Track Clowns.

286
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,752
Holler back.

287
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,550
Titanium Clowns.

288
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,469
I'd say about 50.

289
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,513
About 50 clown groups.
Different clown groups.

290
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,681
There's, like, over 50.

291
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,016
Basically,
it's a bunch of kids...

292
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,559
that do the stripper dance,
paint their faces like clowns...

293
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,436
and go put on a show
for a birthday party.

294
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,854
What's stripper dance?

295
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,523
What's the stripper dance?

296
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,191
What's the stripper dance?

297
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,656
I don't know where the stripper
dance just came from.

298
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,865
It just jumped into the air.

299
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,392
One day, I didn't even know.

300
00:19:23,444 --> 00:19:24,873
Like, I went to a party...

301
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,500
and that was,
like, the new dance.

302
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:35,592
The stripper dance is like where
you open both of your legs...

303
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:37,302
and you bend like this.

304
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,596
And then you gotta be making
your butt bounce like that.

305
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,890
But it really be bouncin'.

306
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,436
It be like a lotta guys
be lookin', like...

307
00:19:46,488 --> 00:19:47,896
"Oh, she's hot. She's bangin'."

308
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,273
So I do the stripper dance...

309
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,275
and I combined it
with a little clownin'...

310
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,235
so I do the stripper,
and I do it like this...

311
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,528
this just stripper plain.

312
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,697
But then I wobble with it,
like, wobble...

313
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,533
and that's the clownin'
and the stripper dance together.

314
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:00,492
'Cause I'm...

315
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,788
Anybody out in Los Angeles,
you have to be taught it.

316
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,790
Out here, it's a flow.
It's a vibe.

317
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:07,739
It's like a connection.

318
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,408
Everybody does it.
Everybody sees it.

319
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,629
We do everything.
We'll Harlem shake for you.

320
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,965
We'll bounce.
We'll do our little thing.

321
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,634
We'll do our little swingin'.
We'll put everything in it.

322
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:20,012
The bleach and
the little African clown walk.

323
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,221
We'll do it all.

324
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,307
The stripper dance
has everything in it.

325
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,266
I've seen some parents
see the little 4-year-olds...

326
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,549
out there poppin'
their booties...

327
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,811
and like, "I would never
let my daughter do that."

328
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,396
"Why? She's out there
having fun.

329
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:37,316
"She's not doing anything wrong.
She's not being sexual.

330
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,317
"There's nobody
out there with her.

331
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,818
"There's nobody touching her.

332
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,738
"She's out there poppin'.
What's wrong with poppin'?"

333
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:51,580
You have stripper dancing,
which we do not do.

334
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:52,748
Twerking.

335
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:56,502
You have... you have...
you have clown dancing...

336
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,629
and then you have
the krump dancing.

337
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,796
It's like hygiene.

338
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,381
Either you smell good,
or you don't.

339
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,674
Either you krump, or you not.

340
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,676
Basically,
we're from the inner city...

341
00:23:04,728 --> 00:23:06,637
what you would call it
the ghetto...

342
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,868
you know, the lower parts
of Los Angeles...

343
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,058
Watts, east side of L.A.,
Compton, Long Beach.

344
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,601
We don't get the best
of everything.

345
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,353
So what we do, we come together,
and we dance.

346
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,909
We don't have
after-school programs.

347
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:12,953
When you don't wanna
do football...

348
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,997
because that's pretty much
the only thing...

349
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,290
that you can do
in the inner city.

350
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,624
There's always a football team.

351
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,824
Because in the inner city...

352
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:22,045
we're all thought of to be
sports players, you know.

353
00:24:22,097 --> 00:24:23,338
Everyone is not a sports player.

354
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,299
Everyone
does not play basketball...

355
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,165
and everybody
does not play football.

356
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,887
There... Is there something
else for us to do?

357
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:33,390
So what we did is...
is a group of us got together...

358
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:34,808
and we invented this.

359
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,144
In better neighborhoods...

360
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,709
they have
performing arts schools.

361
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:42,232
You have ballet,
you have modern...

362
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:44,902
you have jazz,
you have tap...

363
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:47,154
and this is all those
prestigious academies...

364
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,780
you can go to.

365
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,282
It's nothing like that
available to you...

366
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:53,035
when you live where we live.

367
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:56,330
I grew up around here...
Menlo, Normandie...

368
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:57,831
I grew up in this area.

369
00:24:57,873 --> 00:25:01,210
It's real hard for kids like me,
'cause, OK, you have school.

370
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,378
You go to school,
but you have gangbangers...

371
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,923
and you can't even wear
certain colors around here.

372
00:25:05,975 --> 00:25:08,540
So you tend to have an outlet...

373
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:09,635
and sometimes...
well, most of the time...

374
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:10,844
your outlet is music.

375
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:11,887
This is where a lot of music...

376
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:13,597
And you just think
of stuff in your head...

377
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:14,765
it goes through your mind...

378
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,184
and a lot of times,
dancing comes out.

379
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:19,436
When you know
that there's a krump session...

380
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:21,647
me, myself, and I know
a lot of people...

381
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,274
will stop whatever is going on
if there's a gathering...

382
00:25:24,326 --> 00:25:25,557
because it's the spirit
that's there.

383
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,278
There's a spirit in...
In the midst of krumpness...

384
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,240
there is a spirit there,
you know.

385
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,117
A lot of people think
it's just, you know...

386
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:36,328
"Oh, they're just
a bunch of rowdy...

387
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,958
"you know, just ghetto,
just heathen and thugs."

388
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,711
No. No, what we are
are oppressed.

389
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,392
It's more of the...
not the black sheep...

390
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,477
but just a raw version.

391
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,230
Like, you have organized ball,
then you have street ball.

392
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,107
Krumping is the street ball.

393
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,942
You have a boy who gets krump...

394
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:52,321
and just coincidentally,
his girlfriend gets krump.

395
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,657
They face off. It's the
classic battle of the sexes.

396
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,346
And that's what makes it like...

397
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:58,994
"Oh, my God.
Females do this, too?"

398
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:00,329
It looks like we're
fighting somebody...

399
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,164
but we're not fighting anybody.

400
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,958
Like, you can push somebody,
but they see nothing of it.

401
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,711
Fighting is the last thing
on our mind when we're dancing.

402
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:09,296
It is the last thing.

403
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,966
The style changes,
believe it or not, every day.

404
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,260
Every day, the style changes.

405
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,762
And if you haven't
danced in two days...

406
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:01,098
if you come to a krump session,
we're gonna know.

407
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,432
"What did I miss?"

408
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:04,393
"You've been slacking off.
Go home."

409
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:05,894
Once you see the real thing...

410
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:07,771
you're gonna know
it's the real thing.

411
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,523
You're gonna know.

412
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:11,754
You're gonna be, like, "That has
to be the real thing...

413
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:13,944
"because I will never see
anything like this again."

414
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:16,280
When they dance,
you know it's on.

415
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,449
Especially if you have somebody
that's wildin' out like...

416
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:20,409
krumping themselves out.

417
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,035
It gets the girls more amped...

418
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,871
to get out there
and handle their business.

419
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:25,403
Some of us may look gritty.

420
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,083
Some of us may not have
the prettiest smiles.

421
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,669
You know what I'm saying?
But we are krumping.

422
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:32,379
That's the part
of what makes us krump.

423
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,006
It seems
a little bit aggressive...

424
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,049
but it's a good way
to take out your anger...

425
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:38,093
when you go through stuff
in your personal life.

426
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:39,761
But say people have problems...

427
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,680
you know, didn't get this,
didn't get that.

428
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,724
Short on this bill.
Short on that bill.

429
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,726
Just the fact
that you can get krump...

430
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,686
you can channel that anger.

431
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:50,647
Anything negative that has
happened in your life...

432
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,900
you can channel that
into your dancing...

433
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,110
and you can release that
in a positive way...

434
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:58,447
because you're releasing it
through art, the art of dance.

435
00:28:58,489 --> 00:28:59,698
This is our ghetto ballet.

436
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,908
This is how
we express ourselves.

437
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,608
This is the only way
we see fit of storytelling.

438
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,539
This is the only way of making
ourselves feel like we belong.

439
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:14,087
If I know someone is looking
at me, it's gonna be hard.

440
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,924
Some people can't dance if they
have someone looking at them.

441
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,364
But if you know there's a mask
sort of covering your face...

442
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:23,764
you know, then you feel that
it's just you by yourself...

443
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,933
and that your identity
is hidden...

444
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,101
so you can dance
as freely as you want to.

445
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,687
There's not just a bunch
of people acting wild.

446
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:31,636
This is an art form.

447
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,857
It's just as valid
as your ballet...

448
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,984
as your waltz,
as your tap dance.

449
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:38,529
Except we wouldn't have
to go to school for this...

450
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,989
'cause it was already
implanted in us... from birth.

451
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:09,323
Tell us what's happening.

452
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,535
What happened? Tell me.

453
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:15,245
She just struck.

454
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:17,206
It's what
we all been waiting on.

455
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:18,916
Yep.

456
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,293
She has reached...

457
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,712
That's what all of us
been waiting on.

458
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:32,137
I marked my grandfather.

459
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,932
That was the first battle
I really won.

460
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:36,600
Before he a preach...

461
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:39,978
he would sing a song, "Lord,
Lift Me Up and Let Me Stand."

462
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,815
So I just followed
the words to that song...

463
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:47,277
but I was really dancing to
the song that I was dancing to.

464
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:50,697
But I was just... In my mind,
I was dancing to those words.

465
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:54,535
I live with Reverend Turner.

466
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:56,182
He was always there.

467
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,736
I miss my family...

468
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:00,666
because that is my family,
my blood family.

469
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:03,168
But on the other side,
I still...

470
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,046
when I need
a family to go to...

471
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,882
I have my church family
to come to.

472
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:13,136
Clown groups are,
in a real sense, like families.

473
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:14,920
We laugh together.
We cry together.

474
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,974
We go through... Whatever
one person goes through...

475
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:18,954
that whole group
goes through it.

476
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:20,894
Me and my homie,
Baby Tight Eyez...

477
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,271
we went to school together.

478
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:24,898
He played instruments,
and I was always dancing.

479
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,275
It was this one performance...

480
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:28,610
when I got into this whole
clown dancing thing.

481
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:30,863
I was just beginning.
I seen him perform...

482
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:34,241
and I was already labeled
as the tightest clown dancer.

483
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:36,994
I said to myself,
"I want him to be under me.

484
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,454
"I wanted to take him under
my wing so I can train him."

485
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:42,207
'Cause I think he got potential
to be just as tight as I am...

486
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,626
because I see some
of my characteristics in him.

487
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,952
I knew about his background
before I knew him...

488
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:50,007
'cause people would tell me,
"This dude has problems.

489
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:52,259
"He doesn't go to school.
He has no clothes.

490
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,469
"His brother stays
in and out of jail."

491
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:55,429
I used to be like that.

492
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,973
My moms, she... she in jail.

493
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:01,893
She in jail 'cause...
she don't wanna live right.

494
00:35:01,945 --> 00:35:05,772
She been smoking dope
for as long as I know...

495
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:09,359
since I was a baby,
since before I was born.

496
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:10,527
He's had a lot of obstacles.

497
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,979
His mom, um,
had a drug problem...

498
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:18,785
and he's had to face a lot of
challenges as a young person...

499
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:21,538
more so
than the average young person...

500
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,166
who has the advantage
a having a mom who was sober...

501
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,834
or a dad who was sober.

502
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:27,544
He calls me mom, you know...

503
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:29,755
but not just his mom,
his play mom...

504
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,673
but I'm proud to be his pastor.

505
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:34,510
My dad, he was my idol...

506
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,888
'cause I never saw
a man do so much...

507
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,266
and make so much
of the day like he did.

508
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,477
I saw him
as a father figure...

509
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,646
and a role model
at the same time.

510
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:48,941
He was my friend, also.

511
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:51,109
I see, like, lights
flashing in the back.

512
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,195
Then my mom comes,
and she's telling me...

513
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:56,073
she's like, "I'm gonna tell you
your dad committed suicide."

514
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:57,282
You know...

515
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:59,972
shot hisself in the head
in the backyard.

516
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,621
You know, came home,
we found him like this.

517
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:06,625
He was the only child
that kept it...

518
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,710
kind of quietly inside of him.

519
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,254
I felt as if...

520
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,882
I was his only child
that didn't cry...

521
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,260
you know, at the funeral
like everybody else did.

522
00:36:16,312 --> 00:36:18,554
I didn't, you know,
rant and rave.

523
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,848
So for a long time,
I thought, you know,

524
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,891
does that mean
I loved him any less?

525
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,852
And I realized
it doesn't mean that.

526
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:27,896
It's just that everybody
mourns in a different way.

527
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:30,440
I've been in a lot
of family situations.

528
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,630
I've been shot
by a family member.

529
00:36:32,682 --> 00:36:34,778
My grandfather
shot me in my arm.

530
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,408
Right here.

531
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:43,078
Went in through this way
and came out through here.

532
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,623
I was trying to protect
my mom 'cause he was drunk.

533
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:50,752
And I was looking at my body,
looking at my baby's body...

534
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:51,879
and I seen blood.

535
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,256
We didn't know where
the blood was coming from.

536
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:57,301
Chance was standing
on the right side of me.

537
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,304
I don't know how...
how the bullet hit me...

538
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:03,140
and the gun was pointed directly
to my little brother's back.

539
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:04,766
She was holding
my little brother.

540
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:07,603
It must have been God,
'cause turned the bullet...

541
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,980
from when it hit the middle,
it must have turned the bullet.

542
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:12,149
It ricocheted off
of something...

543
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,359
and went straight
through my arm.

544
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,487
If the bullet
hadn't have turned...

545
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:20,115
the bullet would have hit
my little baby.

546
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:22,284
It would have tore him up.

547
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:25,537
But it turned, and it got him
right in this arm...

548
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,789
and it went in, and it went out.

549
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,958
I had to go to a crackhouse...

550
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,336
to get my mama
out of the crackhouse.

551
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:34,671
That's not a good sight
to see as a kid.

552
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,632
I don't remember how old I was.

553
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,509
I just remember that vision.

554
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:43,180
It hurts, yeah, but that's
what I got krumpness for.

555
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:44,973
That's why I get krump.

556
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:49,603
Some people don't feel safe
outside of this place.

557
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,358
I mean, I've seen a lot
of people come from Hollywood...

558
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,859
and come and visit
my home and be like...

559
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:58,946
"How do you live here?
You live in South Central.

560
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:02,115
"Oh, it's so...
it's so dangerous."

561
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:05,285
Like... it's not dangerous.
It's life.

562
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,954
A lot of the kids out here...

563
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:09,957
they don't have
that push or that drive...

564
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:11,792
to go and be in Hollywood...

565
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,545
because so many people
have knocked them down already.

566
00:38:14,597 --> 00:38:16,922
So their comfort is the 'hood.

567
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:19,007
It's scary to go to Hollywood...

568
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:21,051
if you're coming
from the 'hood...

569
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:25,764
for the simple fact that
everything is so intimidating.

570
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:28,350
When I first got
my first glance at Hollywood...

571
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:30,435
everybody seemed
like this to me...

572
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:33,188
and I felt like this...

573
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:36,692
Everybody's so uppity.

574
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:39,862
Everybody has so many things
going for themselves...

575
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:41,196
and here I am.

576
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:44,116
And that's how
the kids here feel.

577
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:46,451
We're just some...

578
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:48,432
some gutter kids.

579
00:38:48,484 --> 00:38:50,372
Tell me something.

580
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:53,250
What has your big homie
in the gangbangin' world...

581
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,627
done for you lately?

582
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,337
I don't have no big homie.

583
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,214
In a gangbanging world?

584
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:01,049
I'm just Baby Tight Eyez.

585
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,801
I walked in a room...

586
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:05,470
and the boy
socked me in my head.

587
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:08,098
So I beat him up real, real bad.

588
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,266
That's what I did.

589
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,768
What are you doing on the 5-5...

590
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,605
whatever hood street
you at, anyway?

591
00:39:14,657 --> 00:39:16,732
I went over there with my dad!

592
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:21,028
Oh. So's your dad gangin' now?

593
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:23,676
Daddy's been a gangbanger.

594
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:26,283
He just started back again?

595
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:27,659
You could say that.

596
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:29,995
If I had to go in that 'hood,
as dangerous as it is...

597
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:31,705
and tell them that...

598
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:35,584
that you not gonna be
a part of this gang, I will.

599
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:37,419
If I have to go
to your school...

600
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:41,465
to show that you ain't
a part of this gang, I will.

601
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:42,883
I know I'm not
a parent or anything...

602
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,219
but I feel like I have
to be an older mentor...

603
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,305
and a positive role model to
keep him on the right track...

604
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:49,806
'cause I know
that's all he needs.

605
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:52,976
I know he looks up to me.
In some ways, I look up to him.

606
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:56,021
I never tell him that, but I do.

607
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:04,446
So all we gonna do
is show him more love...

608
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,698
and he'll overcome this.

609
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,286
He needs to be somewhere
with me...

610
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:12,996
whether his dad likes it or not.

611
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:16,375
'Cause his dad doesn't even
look like he cares about him.

612
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,700
Krumpness is
the closed chapter...

613
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:34,912
of your life of hurt,
sorrow, anguish...

614
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:37,623
that people don't know about.

615
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:42,169
Kids these days
have a whole set of anxieties.

616
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,759
Maybe he's angry that he's
seen me work all my life.

617
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:51,303
We seem to be
in a standstill pattern.

618
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:55,599
Maybe he's angry
that he doesn't have a dad.

619
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,392
He'll say,
"I just never envisioned...

620
00:41:57,434 --> 00:42:00,729
"that dad wouldn't be here."

621
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:53,323
Hey, mama, look at this.

622
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:58,704
"Baby, you're gonna give
yourself a heart attack!

623
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:01,165
"You know you got asthma!
Who taught you that?"

624
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:02,791
Cartoonz, they was krump.

625
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:06,879
I got a black eye.
They said it looked beautiful.

626
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,984
Mama, that's part of dancin'.

627
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:11,049
That's part of my moves. See?

628
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,343
They like it out there.

629
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:14,469
They krump.

630
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:17,848
I used to be a dancer for Tommy.

631
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,892
I, too, as he said...

632
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:23,749
used to be one of
Tommy the Clown's dancers.

633
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:27,566
I thank Tommy the Clown
for doin' what he did...

634
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,276
and startin' the movement...

635
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:31,340
but what we do now
is totally different.

636
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:33,363
"I thank Tommy
for startin' the movement...

637
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:35,282
"but we do it different now."

638
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:38,535
No, you might do it
a little retarded, you know.

639
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:41,747
It became boring,
and it's, like, you need more.

640
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:42,831
You need more.

641
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:46,460
Stop.

642
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:49,505
Let me alone.

643
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:54,176
I wanna get krump.

644
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:06,813
And everybody that got skills,
I want you to go to the front.

645
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:09,566
If you're not dancing,
please go to the back.

646
00:44:09,618 --> 00:44:11,068
We need hot dancers
in the front.

647
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:12,945
You look at gangbanging,
it's a competition.

648
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,404
The Crips go against the Bloods.

649
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,448
They wanna be better than
each other, stuff like that.

650
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,200
So by this clown war
being created...

651
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:19,993
and the BattleZone
being created...

652
00:44:20,035 --> 00:44:21,745
it's like
that same competition...

653
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:23,163
but it's on the flip side.

654
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:26,583
Having so many clown groups,
somebody wants to be the best.

655
00:44:26,635 --> 00:44:28,418
You know, somebody
wants to be number one.

656
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,838
Somebody wants to be number 2.
Somebody wants to be noticed.

657
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:33,257
So that's how Tommy started
the thing called the BattleZone.

658
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:36,385
You know how battle-dancin'
was back in the days.

659
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:40,597
I just brought it back.

660
00:44:40,649 --> 00:44:42,057
With makeup.

661
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:50,315
- BattleZone.
- BattleZone.

662
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:53,277
It's like fightin',
like getting out your anger...

663
00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:55,904
but on the dance floor,
with creative moves.

664
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:57,698
We have the little mama match...

665
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:01,660
where it's little mamas breakin'
it down, showin' skills.

666
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:03,620
The community
is, like, "Oh, my God."

667
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:05,372
We got big boy match.

668
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:08,083
We bring out the big people.

669
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,459
You don't have
to worry about nothin'...

670
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:11,420
'cause you can do it, too.

671
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:18,635
These are matches
that we have inside of a ring...

672
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:21,972
and the crowd, you be the judge.

673
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:23,182
The crowd judge.

674
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,558
You know, millions watchin'.

675
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,060
I don't care if you get
out there and blink an eye.

676
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:28,979
You better blink that eye like
you never blinked it before.

677
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:30,147
You got to show your skills.

678
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:31,273
To me, when I'm dancin'...

679
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:32,900
I don't care if the ugliness
come out or not...

680
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:34,943
'cause I'm dancin'. It's me.

681
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:37,112
So that's the difference
between me and her.

682
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:40,240
It's, like, a big difference
between La Niña and Miss Prissy.

683
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:41,992
When you say La Niña,
I was, like, "Whoa."

684
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:45,287
When you say Miss Prissy,
you're thinking of, like...

685
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:46,914
a pretty girl, like...
you know, like that.

686
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:50,083
You'll see a side of Miss Prissy
you've never seen before.

687
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,169
I'm gonna be the total opposite
of my name...

688
00:45:52,221 --> 00:45:54,463
but that's how it happens.

689
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:56,798
I'm prissy all day,
but at night...

690
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,009
it's something
totally different.

691
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:01,762
I never lost before. I don't
know how it feels to lose.

692
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:04,473
They tellin' the people
that they better than us...

693
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:07,017
'cause, uh, they're
not with us no more?

694
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:09,728
We couldn't be centered anymore.

695
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,356
So you, they, them,
made Tommy? No.

696
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:13,357
Different style of paint.

697
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:14,399
November 15.

698
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:15,776
Different style of dance.

699
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:17,507
At the Great Western Forum,
baby.

700
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:19,196
Different style of everything.

701
00:46:19,238 --> 00:46:21,824
You goes down.

702
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:24,076
I guarantee you that.

703
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,085
Here's your Oscar now.

704
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,920
Tommy's got krump!

705
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:43,846
El Niño Boy,
you goin' down tonight.

706
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:46,181
You goin' down. I see you
with your little bodyguards...

707
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:47,641
but they gonna get beat up, too.

708
00:46:47,693 --> 00:46:49,059
Every time I think
about Larry...

709
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:50,561
it's like, oh, it's over.

710
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:51,895
I ain't even started
dancing yet, and it's over.

711
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:18,005
I want everybody to win.
I want no losses, baby.

712
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:19,339
Whoever lose...

713
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:22,217
I repeat: Whoever lose...

714
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:23,969
is out!

715
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,138
I ain't gonna even
talk about it.

716
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:32,644
There goes the game! Game over!

717
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,960
Hey, y'all, get ready.
Let's go. Let's line up.

718
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:12,703
If they beat us,
I'm gonna retire.

719
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,003
What would you do?
Just say it happened.

720
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:24,006
If they beat me?

721
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:26,967
Hey, I'll probably be
workin' at Vons with Larry.

722
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:13,722
Let's get ready to rumble!

723
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:16,808
Get ready to make some noise!

724
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:20,062
La Niña, you ready, girl?
We about to kick it off.

725
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:21,939
Miss Prissy, you ready, girl?

726
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,565
We about to kick it off.

727
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,238
Let's make some noise for...

728
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,073
La Niña!

729
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:07,419
Do me a favor and make
some noise for Miss Prissy!

730
00:52:17,888 --> 00:52:21,808
And the world-famous, undisputed
champion of the world...

731
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:26,146
is...

732
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:29,858
Miss Prissy!

733
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:54,753
Say, "Larry!"

734
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:56,171
Larry!

735
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:57,214
Say, "Larry!"

736
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:58,257
Larry!

737
00:54:58,298 --> 00:54:59,424
Say, "Larry!"

738
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:17,503
Larry!

739
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:20,440
Give it up for Lil Man!

740
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:29,324
Give it up for Lil Mama!

741
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:43,672
I cannot believe!

742
00:57:44,715 --> 00:57:46,216
This is ludicrous.

743
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:05,819
It's all good.

744
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:08,530
I ain't never got
to practice for nothin'.

745
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:10,449
I came out there,
danced off my head...

746
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:12,367
and came up with
a beautiful show, baby.

747
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:13,785
A beautiful show.

748
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:34,932
They cheated my cousin.
They cheated all y'all.

749
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:37,976
That's some bullshit.
That was weak.

750
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:39,353
All them niggas is weak!

751
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:43,106
All y'all battle! All y'all!

752
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:45,651
Battle! Right! Battle!

753
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:48,987
You all did not win
all of the battles.

754
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:51,072
I'm gonna tell you that.

755
00:58:51,124 --> 00:58:53,116
You didn't win 'em all...

756
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:55,702
but you got cheated out
of about 3.

757
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:01,531
Told y'all we were gonna do it!

758
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:05,170
That wasn't no BattleZone.
That was a concert for Larry.

759
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:06,505
And he won.

760
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:07,798
We won! We won!

761
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,049
We won!

762
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:11,343
Thank you, Jesus!

763
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:13,595
How you doin'?

764
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:14,805
Larry!

765
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,818
He probably worked
his ass off...

766
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,362
for about 3 weeks,
4 weeks or something.

767
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:31,561
You know what I'm saying?

768
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:33,157
I'm real with this.
I'm original.

769
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:34,616
Everything I do is pure.

770
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:35,993
I don't have to practice it.

771
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:37,619
I don't have to want it.
I already got it.

772
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,037
You know what I'm sayin'?

773
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:41,707
And it's done.
I ain't got nothin' to say.

774
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:42,833
I'm done.

775
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:50,382
Feel good to wear this, baby.

776
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:53,177
Be all I am the way I am

777
00:59:53,229 --> 00:59:54,803
'Cause I'm...

778
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:25,751
Tell us... Tell us what happened.

779
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,295
Somebody done broke into his...

780
01:00:28,337 --> 01:00:30,339
Everything OK?

781
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,049
They just broke...
broke in my house.

782
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,675
While we was on here
at the BattleZone...

783
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:38,013
they broke in my house.
They thrashed everything.

784
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:41,642
You try and work hard
for these people...

785
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:43,894
but people
are always doin' stuff.

786
01:00:45,187 --> 01:00:48,690
Doin' stuff,
and they doin' this stuff.

787
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:50,651
It's hard, man!

788
01:00:54,696 --> 01:00:58,700
They can't do that.
They can't do that.

789
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:00,661
Stand over here, sir.

790
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:06,792
While I was
winnin' the BattleZone...

791
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:09,253
I was losing
BattleZone over here.

792
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:10,546
They came in the house...

793
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:12,130
broke in the house,
and took everything.

794
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:13,549
The front door is over there?

795
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,092
No, the front door
and this door.

796
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:16,385
This is the sliding door...

797
01:01:16,426 --> 01:01:18,345
and there's a door through
that washroom over there.

798
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:20,806
OK. I'm gonna check this out.

799
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:30,232
You just have to know that...

800
01:01:30,274 --> 01:01:32,609
because you're doing
something right...

801
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:34,486
this is happening.

802
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:35,821
OK? These things happen...

803
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:40,033
only when people do
something positive. OK?

804
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:43,078
And, you know,
you're trying to do...

805
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,039
something very good
for the children...

806
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:48,792
for the kids, and this is
unfortunate, but it is...

807
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:49,877
Hey, baby.

808
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:51,086
Hi, daddy.

809
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:52,254
How you doin'?

810
01:01:52,296 --> 01:01:53,380
Fine.

811
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:55,257
Yeah, I feel you.

812
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:56,884
Daddy.

813
01:01:56,925 --> 01:02:00,512
Th... there.

814
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:02,910
There you go, daddy.

815
01:02:02,962 --> 01:02:05,267
Something's missing.

816
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:07,717
My DVD player gone.

817
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:10,147
Did you dust the front door?
Because that wouldn't...

818
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:11,940
We dust the whole house, sir.

819
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:13,484
We dust the whole house.

820
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:14,891
Don't trip. Forget this...

821
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:18,030
'cause we fi'n
to get a mansion.

822
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:20,782
We're gonna have a mansion
with everything we want in it.

823
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:21,867
Amen.

824
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:23,202
They can trash it...

825
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:25,329
'cause we movin'
to bigger and better things.

826
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:27,372
Everything happens
for a reason...

827
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:28,582
and that lets you know
we have to leave.

828
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:29,750
Right.

829
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,586
We have to get out of here.
That's all that is.

830
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:34,129
They heard you weren't
movin' fast enough.

831
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:35,797
They was tryin' to help you.

832
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,257
Everything happens for a reason.

833
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:38,634
That's how you
got to look at it.

834
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:39,583
I remember that.

835
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:41,178
We fi'n to go in a mansion.

836
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,721
We're gonna have a 20-story.

837
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:43,722
Let's go!

838
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:46,642
Clownin' is cool,
but the hard part...

839
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:49,061
is the life outside of clownin'.

840
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:52,439
This is Inglewood.
So this is Inglewood.

841
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:55,818
Inglewood is set up
to be a deadly place...

842
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,110
just like South Central.

843
01:02:57,152 --> 01:02:58,695
South Central is a deadly place.

844
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:01,573
A couple of weeks ago,
we seen a guy get shot.

845
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:04,409
First time I seen something
like that in my life.

846
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:05,702
We're drivin'.

847
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:08,038
I'm in the truck.
I'm drivin' the truck.

848
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,206
Tommy's drivin' the 5.0.

849
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:10,833
You know, he stops.

850
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:13,168
He bent over
to pick up somethin'...

851
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:14,920
and soon as he leans back up,
we hear a shot.

852
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:18,340
Man, laid out
on the corner right there.

853
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:20,843
I ain't never seen
nothin' like that.

854
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:22,928
Head blown all off.
All over the corner.

855
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,805
Drivin' down the street
from a school.

856
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:26,640
We just finished
doing this preschool.

857
01:03:26,682 --> 01:03:29,476
All the kids, everybody saw it.

858
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:32,271
It was just... too dramatic.

859
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:35,107
Ain't nothin' for them
to do but to be bad.

860
01:03:35,149 --> 01:03:37,693
I mean, if you
grew up around people...

861
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:40,779
that got a kick
out of hurtin' people...

862
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:43,824
or got a kick out
of robbin' people...

863
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:47,161
and that's all
around you 24/7 all day...

864
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:49,621
that means eventually...

865
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:52,332
you gonna start catching
a feel for it.

866
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:54,585
It's so much violence
going on...

867
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:58,422
and, I mean, you know,
shootings, killings, I mean...

868
01:03:58,474 --> 01:04:01,133
you know, the kids just
need somethin' positive.

869
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:02,801
The way life is out here...

870
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:05,304
it's hard for you
to walk down a street...

871
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:09,057
and not know that you're
not gonna get shot today.

872
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:12,978
You don't even have to be
part of a gang or whatever.

873
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,857
You could just be that person
walking to the store.

874
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:18,650
Just walking
out in the street...

875
01:04:18,702 --> 01:04:20,402
you could get shot
for no reason.

876
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:24,907
Just for looking like somebody,
you get shot.

877
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:52,518
There she goes. There she goes!

878
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:02,528
Family members of
15-year-old Quinesha Dunford...

879
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:04,446
say she simply
left home last night...

880
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:06,281
to walk to the store
to buy a soda...

881
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:08,075
when she was gunned down.

882
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:10,452
Her 13-year-old friend
who was walking with her...

883
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:12,955
Demario Moore,
was also shot dead.

884
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:14,706
Authorities say
for no apparent reason...

885
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:16,333
known gang members
targeted the kids...

886
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:19,378
and killed them as they
walked along 54th street...

887
01:05:19,419 --> 01:05:22,381
between Budlong and
Normandie Avenues in south L.A.

888
01:05:22,422 --> 01:05:23,590
She was one of those victims...

889
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:26,093
an innocent victim,
that go to practice...

890
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:28,679
that do everything
that you supposed to do...

891
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,265
and was at the wrong place
at the wrong time...

892
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:34,143
to say hi to somebody
across the light...

893
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:36,228
when the store is right there.

894
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:40,190
From crazy people
runnin' the block...

895
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:44,278
shootin' out of a car, and
don't know who they shootin'.

896
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,573
They shoot old people,
young people, babies.

897
01:05:47,614 --> 01:05:49,032
They didn't care.

898
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:51,493
They came around the block
just shootin' people.

899
01:05:51,535 --> 01:05:52,911
And she happened to be...

900
01:05:52,953 --> 01:05:54,997
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

901
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:56,915
'Cause she had so much to do.

902
01:05:56,957 --> 01:05:59,751
She loved dancin'.
She loved drill team.

903
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:02,546
She loved cheerleading.
She loved it all.

904
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:17,644
His father, I think,
was a old gang member, an O.G.

905
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:21,440
And his father's enemies
was lookin' for somebody...

906
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:24,401
and they shot at them.
Both of them got killed.

907
01:06:24,443 --> 01:06:26,528
See, that just
make me feel like...

908
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,238
I don't wanna be
in this place no more.

909
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,948
But you just can't leave.
This is my home.

910
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:36,663
Amazing grace

911
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:41,752
How sweet

912
01:06:41,793 --> 01:06:46,798
The sound

913
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,762
That saved

914
01:06:51,803 --> 01:06:57,454
A wretch

915
01:06:57,506 --> 01:07:03,059
Like me

916
01:07:03,111 --> 01:07:08,612
I once

917
01:07:08,654 --> 01:07:13,408
Was lost

918
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:17,996
But now

919
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:22,459
I'm found

920
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:26,922
I was blind

921
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:31,301
But now

922
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:34,304
I

923
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:37,266
See

924
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:52,281
Austin Harris is my name.

925
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:54,491
Selling caskets is my game.

926
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:57,411
I've been neighbors
to the clowns about 9 months...

927
01:07:57,452 --> 01:08:03,375
and we all get together
just fine.

928
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:04,626
Lot of people think...

929
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:06,753
the old folks the one
all doin' all the dyin'...

930
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:08,839
but you young folks
beatin' us out of here, boy.

931
01:08:08,881 --> 01:08:11,341
You know that?
You're killin' yourselves.

932
01:08:11,383 --> 01:08:13,677
Don't make sense.

933
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:16,680
But anyway, to each his own.

934
01:08:16,722 --> 01:08:19,850
You just tell your parents
where I am.

935
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:21,059
When we throw
our club nights...

936
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:22,019
Right.

937
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,260
After we throw our clubs...

938
01:08:23,312 --> 01:08:25,063
people be out there
hangin' out and everything...

939
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:26,398
and drinkin',
whatever they doin'...

940
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,524
and they look in here...

941
01:08:27,566 --> 01:08:28,650
that's like givin'
them a message like...

942
01:08:28,692 --> 01:08:30,027
Right, right, right.

943
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:31,570
OK, you have fun, but if
you clown around too much...

944
01:08:31,612 --> 01:08:33,530
you're gonna end up right here.

945
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:35,657
Reality, it sets in.
It will. It will. You know.

946
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:37,159
You need to come
to the club, though.

947
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:38,202
I do?

948
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:40,245
You do, 'cause
I think you still got...

949
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:41,538
Do a little boogie?

950
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:42,706
You still doin' a little boogie.

951
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:45,083
Oh, yeah, well, I need that.
I used to do it.

952
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:48,337
I mean, I done seen a lot
of things happen in my life.

953
01:08:48,378 --> 01:08:49,588
A whole lot.

954
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:51,590
And I'm only 20 years old.

955
01:08:51,632 --> 01:08:54,510
Swoop, horrible where he lives.

956
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:56,094
Horrible, you know?

957
01:08:56,136 --> 01:08:59,014
And it's good that,
you know, he stopped...

958
01:08:59,056 --> 01:09:02,726
'cause he was... he was...
he was in that direction...

959
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:06,355
but he twisted it,
he changed it, came to clownin'.

960
01:09:06,396 --> 01:09:08,857
Been here ever since,
which was good...

961
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:11,318
'cause he was there.
He was almost there.

962
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:13,987
Life is not a game.

963
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:15,697
That's right. I hear you.

964
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:16,865
I'm serious.

965
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:19,409
Take advantage of it
while you can.

966
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:20,911
Yeah, you better clown right.

967
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,121
I know y'all's
some good clowns...

968
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:24,790
but y'all better clown right.

969
01:09:24,832 --> 01:09:25,916
'Cause if you don't...

970
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:27,334
I know where
you're gonna end up.

971
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:28,585
Right here...

972
01:09:29,711 --> 01:09:32,214
with me.

973
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:34,216
Go on in. Take a look.

974
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:35,165
Not now.

975
01:09:35,217 --> 01:09:36,802
No, come on in here.
Come on.

976
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:38,095
You wanna go in?

977
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:40,639
Yeah. Find a casket
that's big enough for you.

978
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:43,225
We can have one special made.

979
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:44,518
Don't worry.

980
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,735
I used to be... Back in the day,
I was a gangbanger.

981
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:55,185
My mother and my father
were both addicts...

982
01:09:55,237 --> 01:09:57,865
so the only family I had was
the family in the streets...

983
01:09:57,906 --> 01:10:00,909
that showed me
what I thought was love.

984
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:02,536
You know what I mean?

985
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:04,163
It's like, "We loyal to you
and we sisters"...

986
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:06,206
and we're hangin' out and,
you know, kind of like...

987
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:07,875
a commitment,
we were down for each other.

988
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,626
And sometimes, unfortunately...

989
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:11,503
kids that don't get it
at home...

990
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:13,172
have to go and get it
in the streets.

991
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:14,756
And when they get it
in the streets...

992
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:17,676
it's mistaken, because
in the end, nobody's ever there.

993
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:20,846
On the streets, I found,
like, street mothers...

994
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:23,974
and street brothers
and street sisters, you know...

995
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:25,726
that kind of looked out for me.

996
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:28,103
At least I thought
they looked out for me.

997
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:29,730
What happened?

998
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:31,773
Well, I ended up
in some situations where...

999
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:34,401
where people ran out on me...

1000
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:38,614
when my life took a bad turn,
that they bailed out, you know.

1001
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:40,449
I had a bout
with substance abuse...

1002
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:42,399
for about 15 years, you know.

1003
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:45,454
And nobody was there in the end.
Nobody was there in the end.

1004
01:10:45,496 --> 01:10:46,955
And that's
when I had to turn to God.

1005
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:48,457
I just said,
"God, please help me.

1006
01:10:48,499 --> 01:10:49,625
"I don't wanna die this way."

1007
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:50,792
When did this happen?

1008
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:52,242
6 years ago.

1009
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:53,910
And so Dragon was around...

1010
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:57,925
Dragon was... Dragon took care
of his siblings...

1011
01:10:57,966 --> 01:10:59,760
when I went through my bout.

1012
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:01,512
Dragon was father to these kids.

1013
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:03,806
Dragon would cook, clean,
get them to school.

1014
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:05,390
And he was the father.

1015
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:07,518
Statistically,
my kids should be messed up.

1016
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:09,770
My kids are great.
They're obedient.

1017
01:11:09,812 --> 01:11:11,814
They're well-disciplined.
They're respectful.

1018
01:11:11,855 --> 01:11:14,483
And I got great kids, you know?

1019
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:17,486
Dragon here.

1020
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:22,866
Hey, old bat.

1021
01:11:22,908 --> 01:11:24,827
Don't say that.

1022
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:26,745
Oh, Dragon.

1023
01:11:26,787 --> 01:11:29,289
Why'd you say that stuff
on the phone to me?

1024
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:31,750
Thank you, Dragon.

1025
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:34,670
The first time
I saw Dragon get krump...

1026
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:36,630
I thought he was on drugs...

1027
01:11:36,672 --> 01:11:38,090
or maybe somebody had
given him somethin'.

1028
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:40,217
He was just, like,
runnin' around...

1029
01:11:40,259 --> 01:11:42,052
and screamin,
tearin' off his clothes.

1030
01:11:42,094 --> 01:11:43,846
And I didn't know
what happened to him.

1031
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:45,462
Then he explained to me...

1032
01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:46,974
that it was
a new form of dancing...

1033
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:48,308
that kind of took 'em
back to their roots.

1034
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:50,060
I love it now.

1035
01:11:50,102 --> 01:11:51,770
I can krump, too.

1036
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:55,357
I get krump for Christ,
but I get krump.

1037
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:57,474
Is there a difference?

1038
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:59,486
I don't think
there is a difference.

1039
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:02,072
I think when they dance,
they dance from their spirit.

1040
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:06,827
And when I'm... when I'm at
church, I dance from my spirit.

1041
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,710
If you go
to a Christian church...

1042
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:18,714
you go to a Pentecostal,
a Methodist, a Baptist church...

1043
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:20,716
these same movements
can be found in church.

1044
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:22,332
Dragon brought me
back to Christ.

1045
01:12:22,384 --> 01:12:25,554
One day, we were getting
krump in my garage...

1046
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:27,556
and he told me,
"You'd be a lot better...

1047
01:12:27,598 --> 01:12:29,391
"if you start going
back to church."

1048
01:12:29,433 --> 01:12:31,174
And I was, like, "Please."

1049
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:34,563
I forgot what
started me on my way...

1050
01:12:34,605 --> 01:12:38,400
and it was God,
and it was God telling me...

1051
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:40,819
"My child, this is your gift.
Use it."

1052
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:43,947
We're not gonna be clones of
the commercial hip-hop world...

1053
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:47,284
because that's been seen
for so many years.

1054
01:12:47,326 --> 01:12:50,537
Somebody's waitin'
on something different...

1055
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:54,541
another generation of kids
with morals and values...

1056
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:55,866
that they won't need...

1057
01:12:55,918 --> 01:13:00,297
what's being commercialized
or tailor-made for them...

1058
01:13:00,339 --> 01:13:03,926
custom-made, because I feel
that we're custom-made.

1059
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:08,555
And we're of more value
than any piece of jewelry...

1060
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:13,143
or any car or any big house
that anybody could buy.

1061
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:11,334
I lost my house, got evicted...

1062
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:14,389
and I had to move in
to an apartment.

1063
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:16,350
And where I'm at today, movin'.

1064
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:19,019
If I end up with nothin',
I mean, it hurts...

1065
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:23,065
but it's like... I mean, dang.
It's like start over again.

1066
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:27,110
There's a lot of things I wish
I could change if I could...

1067
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:28,362
if I could start back over.

1068
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:31,990
And after taking a major loss
like losing your house...

1069
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:35,619
Iosing all your money, you got
to start over, and, uh...

1070
01:15:35,661 --> 01:15:38,914
yeah, survivin'
in South Central...

1071
01:15:38,956 --> 01:15:42,334
where they say
bustin' a cap is fundamental.

1072
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:44,878
When they get to hatin',
start shakin'.

1073
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:49,216
All right. Let's get ready
to rock 'n' roll, baby.

1074
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:50,300
This is it... showtime.

1075
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,396
I think I was
the first Caucasian...

1076
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:51,356
to be dancin' like this.

1077
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:53,942
And when I first seen it,
I just loved it.

1078
01:18:53,984 --> 01:18:55,444
I mean, I wanted to do it.

1079
01:18:55,486 --> 01:18:57,488
It was hard for me to do it,
'cause they was...

1080
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:59,448
"This white boy,
he ain't got no rhythm...

1081
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:01,450
"he ain't doing this,
he ain't gonna do it right."

1082
01:19:01,492 --> 01:19:03,452
When I was jumpin' out the car,
they just surprised.

1083
01:19:03,494 --> 01:19:05,037
They mouths dropped like...

1084
01:19:05,078 --> 01:19:08,165
"Oh, my God, they got a white
boy. What is he gonna do?

1085
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:09,791
"How is he gonna
go about dancin'?"

1086
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:14,546
Yeah, we get respect,
the way we dance out there...

1087
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:19,301
'cause they don't think Asians
dance like black people.

1088
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:28,268
You got a certain talent...

1089
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:31,772
don't be... don't be
afraid to express it.

1090
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:43,158
We have the belief
that we can be somebody...

1091
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,118
and that we're
gonna be somebody.

1092
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,913
We're gonna... we're gonna rise,
no matter what.

1093
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:57,256
The sky is the limit,
and there is no limit.
