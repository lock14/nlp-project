1
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,480
<i>Every time I hold you</i>

2
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,520
<i>There's a feeling</i>

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,320
<i>You know, it's a
feeling that pulls me in</i>

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,840
<i>Deeper and deeper into your mind</i>

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,680
<i>Every time</i>

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,240
<i>And I want more and
more until they stop</i>

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
<i>Oh, there's something
about you, baby</i>

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,680
<i>You're all I need</i>

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,000
<i>Slip into somethingmore comfortable.
Hawksin Hotels.</i>

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,800
<i>You're everything to me</i>

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,720
We think it really brands the chain.

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,040
Hedonistic opulence, pampering.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,680
The place to go when
you're with someone special.

14
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,280
Well, I think it's perfect.

15
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,760
If, by "perfect," you mean low-rent porn

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,320
that's completely inappropriate
for me or my hotels.

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Even the chocolate was naked.

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,760
- We could lose the chocolate.
- Why are you speaking?

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,960
- Stop speaking. Why is he speaking?
- I don't know.

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,120
You know what let's do?
When I'm speaking, you stop speaking.

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,560
- Right.
- He did it again.

22
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,840
Mike?

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,600
Well put.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
Look, fellows,
I don't want my customers thinking

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,440
about what their bed was doing
before they got in it.

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,440
On the good side,
the pastries were delicious.

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,840
<i>Amici.</i>

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,400
<i>Avanti.</i>

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,200
Mr. Hawksin?

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,720
The passion angle was something that
we decided on months ago.

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,360
Apparently, we define
the word differently.

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,640
Have you ever even stayed
at a Hawksin hotel?

33
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,400
Because judging from what I saw in there,
you have no idea what we believe in.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,160
I've never actually stayed
in a Hawksin hotel per se, but...

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,640
And what about the international angle?

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,520
We decided we would go
for global business.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,920
Exactly. I'm with you, sir. Great idea.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,880
Today's business needs to attract
a wider customer base.

39
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,800
- Please, sir, we can do this.
- Again with the talking.

40
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,680
All right, this isn't the first time
a tryst in a hotel room didn't go well.

41
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,800
But just give us one more shot.

42
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,840
If we don't make a commercial
that tells the whole world

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,520
exactly who Hawksin Hotels really is,

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
well, then I'll...

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,160
We'll both quit the business forever.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,120
Scout's honor. You have my word.

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,840
And my passion.

48
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,960
- Passion.
- Again with the talking.

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,320
You see Mike, here?

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,240
He's worked for me for 37 years,
and hasn't said one word the whole time.

51
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,280
I'll tell you what.

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,520
We're opening a new five-star restaurant
at the Hawksin Grand

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,280
in San Francisco next week.
You're both invited.

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,920
You'll come up,
get a feel for the place, if you can.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,440
Call the office. They'll set it up.
"Leave the business."

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you, sir.

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,600
What did I tell you about the girl
climbing on the guy's lap like that?

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,480
What? It was tasteful.

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,680
I need to see the proofs before
you send them to LA. Before...

60
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,200
Call Ted Stevens' new agent.
See if Ted can shoot a spot

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
10 days from now.
Also, there was that video...

62
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
Messenger the Milan samples
to Granger's apartment.

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,880
...performance artist,
he was a New School graduate?

64
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,440
- I want to see those tonight.
- I don't remember his name,

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,720
- but find him and give me his reel.
- Yeah. Okay.

66
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,840
Yeah, thanks.

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,000
I've got one more shot with Hawksin.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,000
If we don't get this account, I don't
know if Charlie and I are gonna make it.

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,040
Don't worry about it.

70
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,080
International angle?
What does that even mean?

71
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,280
You'll come up with something.
You always do.

72
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,240
Hello. Yeah, that's me.

73
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,600
I'm not interested.

74
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,440
CITYone Bank.

75
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,800
I was afraid it was another woman
who heard about your imminent success.

76
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,720
I didn't think Emory Banks
had a jealous bone in her body.

77
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,360
Over shoes and careers, yes.

78
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,480
Other women, not so much.

79
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,960
- You're amazing.
- I know.

80
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,440
Mr. Woodruff, I'm afraid
your card's been declined.

81
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,480
Really?

82
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,960
Just give me a minute. Yeah?

83
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,360
<i>Mr. Woodruff, this is Jennifer David
from CITYone Bank calling again.</i>

84
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,800
<i>Please don't hang up, sir,
we seem to have a situation.</i>

85
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,440
Yeah, it's more of a train wreck, actually.
I just tried to use my card.

86
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,120
<i>We've frozen it for
your protection.</i>

87
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,240
Our fraud division has picked up
more than $28,000 in charges

88
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,360
within the last 10 days to your account.

89
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,160
- Holy shit!
- What is going on?

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,560
<i>- It's $28,422...
- Somebody stole my card number.</i>

91
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,440
...and 48 cents, to be exact.

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,960
<i>- So I take it these aren't yours?
- Yeah.</i>

93
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,960
- I mean, no, no.
- That should work.

94
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,200
- Hey, hold on.
- Thank you.

95
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,400
I've got this.
Just give me a minute.

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
- Mr. Granger?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,040
I just need to verify
some of these charges.

98
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,280
Jessica, this isn't really a good time.
Why don't you call me tomorrow morning?

99
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,600
It's Jennifer, actually.

100
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,640
<i>Jennifer David.
And I can call you then.</i>

101
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,360
<i>Please don't try to use your...</i>

102
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,760
Let's go.

103
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,920
Doesn't little Granger want
to come out and play?

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,360
No. Little Granger's tired.

105
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,240
Sorry, it's probably work.

106
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,400
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Woodruff?</i>

107
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,320
<i>- Speaking.
- This is Jennifer David</i>

108
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,720
<i>from CITYone Bank Card.
It's 8:00 AM.</i>

109
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
Oh, right. My wake-up call.

110
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,600
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

111
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,040
<i>- Now, we need to establish...
- This is important, Em.</i>

112
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,640
<i>...which of these charges are fraudulent.
- Do you want to get off the phone?</i>

113
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,920
<i>First, if you wouldn't mind
answering a few questions.</i>

114
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,040
<i>Your mother's maiden name?</i>

115
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,120
I can't believe you.
Just hang up.

116
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,600
- Klinger. No.
- Okay.

117
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,960
Strike that, that was
her second husband. Winslow.

118
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,000
<i>- Is this a bad time, sir?
- Yes, it is.</i>

119
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,280
Sorry about that, Ms. David,
that was my maid.

120
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,200
She was being naughty. Please continue.

121
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,080
Okay.
Can you list your last three purchases?

122
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,120
Let's see.

123
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,960
<i>I bought an iPod a few days ago
for the gym,</i>

124
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,840
took a potential client to Pete's,
best ribs in town.

125
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,240
You'll probably see that charge
on my card a lot.

126
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,440
<i>Do you remember a charge of $250
at Lotus Florists, four days ago?</i>

127
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,520
- I didn't get any flowers.
- No, not mine.

128
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,360
<i>They were delivered
to a Ms. Leslie Moore.</i>

129
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,800
- Ms. Leslie "We're just friends" Leslie?
- Em.

130
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,880
...O- O-R-E, that's right.

131
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,400
Her mother was sick.
She just passed the bar.

132
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,600
- Flowers are very thoughtful.
- You're killing me here, David.

133
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,160
- Em, you're not leaving, are you?
- Whatever.

134
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,880
<i>- Okay, now, Mr. Woodruff...
- I'm gonna have Emily come by</i>

135
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,120
<i>- and get things, all right?
- I'm going to fax you a print-out</i>

136
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,040
<i>of all these charges. Circle the ones
that are yours, and then fax it back to me.</i>

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,160
Great.

138
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,920
At least tell me it's not raining again.
Is it nice out?

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,280
I don't know, sir. I'm in San Francisco.

140
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,680
SF, you know, City by the Bay,

141
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,000
home of the 49ers, Golden Gate Bridge,
cable cars...

142
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,520
May I help you?

143
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,480
This is Jennifer David
from CITYone Bank Card calling.

144
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
548...

145
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,800
420...

146
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
Call you tonight?

147
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,800
But I need you to really try to...

148
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,040
Please don't hang up, sir...

149
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,320
All right, sir, I'd be happy to help you.

150
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,320
That should take care of it for now.

151
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,160
That's it for me.

152
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,720
That was my 42nd hang-up tonight.

153
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,040
I've had like four "Get lost, idiots,"
and 16 "Lose my number, morons."

154
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,080
And I think this guy just called me
a douchebag. What's that?

155
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,200
I don't know.

156
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,880
I'm so happy they moved me
to Lost or Stolen.

157
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,560
You're so lucky.

158
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,800
Do you want to go for shopping
before it gets too crowded?

159
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,520
- Okay.
- You know, I have to go to Vikram's house

160
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,160
this Sunday, and Papa told me
to get a new dress.

161
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,120
- Wow!
- He said, "Every time the Bhatias see you

162
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,400
"in jeans, I'm afraid
they're beginning to think

163
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,480
"that their future daughter-in-law
is a boy!"

164
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
Your father has a point.

165
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,280
Vikram comes from a very good family,
you should impress them.

166
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,640
- You're killing me here.
- I'm what?

167
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,800
It's a slang.
You need to pay attention in class.

168
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,000
Teacher's pest?

169
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,360
The toilet is going up.
You just watch it.

170
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Good, you're here.

171
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,640
<i>Priya, beta, you know
father was saying that...</i>

172
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,120
Mama, please, let me sleep.
Good night. Please.

173
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
In that case, good night.

174
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,880
Okay, I got one. "From the food

175
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,800
"to the toilet paper,

176
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
"Hawksin's means quality."

177
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,520
Yeah. That's really bad.

178
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,000
"If you're tired
and you need a place to sleep..."

179
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,240
I've got nothing.

180
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,440
"People who stay with Hawksin's
are smarter than when they check out,

181
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,880
"than when they check in."

182
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,280
No, no, no, no.
That doesn't make any sense.

183
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,680
Govinda, go get your sister,
otherwise she'll be late for work.

184
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,040
- Shh, Ma, I'm watching cricket.
- Govinda!

185
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,400
Okay, okay. Priya, wake up!

186
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,200
- Priya, you'll be late for work.
- Look at this boy, huh?

187
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,680
- Priya!
- All the time, he's watching these

188
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,800
- terrible programs on television.
- Yes!

189
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
These cricket hoodlums.
And he behaves like that.

190
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,640
- Good morning.
- Ah! It's your morning.

191
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,200
It's our evening, huh?
Your dinner's almost ready.

192
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,400
You're not wearing those boys' pants
to the Bhatias', are you?

193
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,120
I have a dress, don't worry.
And what is this?

194
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Ah! That's a birthday present
for your father's cousin, Auntie Rani.

195
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,360
And Govinda has to take it
to the post soon,

196
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
otherwise it won't make it on time
to Palo Alto, right, Govinda?

197
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
- Yeah, Ma.
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

198
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,200
You're back? Any good news?

199
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,120
I went all the way to Mud Island.
They were not even at home.

200
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,440
I don't want to talk about it.

201
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,560
- What's the score?
- 121 for six.

202
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,760
Sounds like my day.
- Hi, Papa, how was your day?

203
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,960
I don't want to talk about it.

204
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,480
Another night without a family dinner.

205
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,840
If you sat down with me now,
we could eat together.

206
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,760
Just because you have to work
all night out

207
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,480
doesn't mean that I have my dinner
at 5:30 in the evening.

208
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,480
<i>If you read India Today this week,</i>

209
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,200
it talks about
how we are the future of India.

210
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,920
And, you know,
some 10,000 people applied for the job,

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,240
and only 100 were accepted.
And I'm making good money.

212
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,280
Even though it's not normal
for a young woman like you

213
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,600
to work all night on the phone,
talking to strangers,

214
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,000
<i>- pretending to be Americano.
- Yes, yes!</i>

215
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,040
We did it! We scored!

216
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,840
Like being Indian is so normal.

217
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,240
All right. I got some more.

218
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,600
- Next.
- "Our mini-bars will get you maxi-drunk."

219
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,040
Oh, my gosh.

220
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,480
Okay, let's start with your celebrities.

221
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,760
Sarah Michelle Gellar.
- Sarah Michelle Gellar.

222
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,520
Sarah Michelle Gellar. Good. Next.

223
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,560
Sarah Jessica Parker.
- Sarah Jessica Parker.

224
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,080
Sarah Jessica Parker. Good.

225
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,400
Mary-Louise Parker.
That was in your handout.

226
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,200
All right?

227
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,080
That is Dylan...

228
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,800
That's Dermot Mulroney,

229
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,240
<i>not to be confused with Dylan McDermott,
formerly of The Practice.</i>

230
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,760
Very good, Priya.

231
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,640
Okay, tonight, I want you to study
your Jessicas and your Ryans, okay?

232
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,240
- If somebody calls you a dawg?
- That's good.

233
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,000
- Right, but if you dog somebody?
- That's bad.

234
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,560
Word. Okay.

235
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,880
Who makes the square burger?
Is it Wendy's, Burger King or McDonald's?

236
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,320
Burger King.

237
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,040
Wendy's, Zia.

238
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,120
Wendy's makes the square burger.

239
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,440
Burger King is Home of the Whopper.

240
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,240
And McDonald's is famous
for its Quarter Pounder, with or...

241
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,720
- Without cheese.
...without cheese. Good.

242
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,080
- Yes, Priya.
- But many of them

243
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,680
are starting to add salads
and low-fat chicken dishes,

244
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,080
because of the obesity
which is plaguing the country.

245
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,480
Good. Okay, that's it, everybody.

246
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,960
Sunday, I want all those
from the Southwest here at 6:00, please,

247
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,360
and Californians, Monday at 5:30,

248
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,640
and New Jersey,
everyone here at 8:00, please.

249
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,240
- Ms. Prasad?
- Yes, Zia.

250
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,400
May I please move out of New Jersey?
Everyone keeps swearing at me.

251
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,240
Zia, you know the rules.
Everyone starts in New Jersey,

252
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
and works their way out.

253
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,560
<i>Flirting with disaster</i>

254
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,560
<i>You're the one I'm after</i>

255
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,960
<i>Think I've found my destiny</i>

256
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,880
<i>Luxury and danger</i>

257
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,880
<i>Rapture me, my stranger</i>

258
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,680
<i>Hold me close, don't let me be</i>

259
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,480
<i>I could fly on the wings of my heart</i>

260
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,400
<i>Deep inside, I've been falling apart</i>

261
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
<i>L- L-Love</i>

262
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,600
<i>There's a magic in you</i>

263
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,560
<i>And I'll be under your spell</i>

264
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,800
<i>L- L-Love</i>

265
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,360
You are not sick.

266
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,600
You don't have time to be sick.

267
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,600
Therefore, you are not sick.

268
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,240
Hello.

269
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,720
<i>Mr. Woodruff, this is Jennifer David</i>

270
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,720
from CITYone Bank. How are you?

271
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,640
- I'm sick.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

272
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,080
<i>- If this is a bad time...
- No, no, no, it's fine.</i>

273
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,760
It's just, I'm...

274
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,720
He's sneezing.

275
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,000
He's allergic to you.
Just put down the phone.

276
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,800
<i>Maybe I should call you later, sir...</i>

277
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,120
I don't have time to be sick today, David.
I gotta nail this thing.

278
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,760
He's building something.

279
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,720
If you want to feel better right away
then try sucking on a lemon,

280
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,360
then drinking a tall glass of warm water
with cardamom and fresh ginger.

281
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,600
I'll try that.

282
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,960
I'll call you back later, sir.
Good luck with your nailing.

283
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,920
Bye!

284
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,120
<i>There's a magic in you
and I'll be under your spell</i>

285
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,080
- We going late tonight?
- Not tonight.

286
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,360
I've got to get home early,
make some comfort food, get some sleep,

287
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,200
get better for tomorrow.

288
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,440
I got cleared for tonight,

289
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,360
now I've got to check with Karen
about tomorrow?

290
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,880
- Spoken like a true married man.
- Hey, it could happen to you, too.

291
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,400
Didn't Emory make the
"Top 20 Hottest Women in New York" list?

292
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,680
We're just having fun, pal, okay?

293
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,920
Don't drag me
into your own little personal hell.

294
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,080
The guys that say
they don't want to get married,

295
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,360
they're the ones who surprise you.

296
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,800
So, since you've been
on the wedding bandwagon since day one,

297
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
you must secretly dread the actual event.

298
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,760
- You know, there's still time to back out.
- I'm not you.

299
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,760
What the hell are you drinking?
It smells like an Indian restaurant.

300
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,440
Cold remedy.
Credit-card girl told me about it.

301
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,120
Still can't believe
someone stole your identity.

302
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,560
I mean, of all the identities out there
to steal, who'd want to steal yours?

303
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,600
- Hope they're living large on your dime.
- Nice. Good friend.

304
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,800
There was an attempt to use your card
for $700 at the Mystery Box.

305
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,560
Seriously?

306
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,920
Unless you throw in a night
with the cashier and some dolls,

307
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,360
how do you spend that much
at a store like that?

308
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,640
I don't know what kind
of store it is, sir.

309
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,240
Oh, come on.
They don't have them in San Francisco?

310
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,880
Yeah. Sure.

311
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,960
Which is why I was certain
this wasn't your charge.

312
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,040
Because I don't give off
a sexually adventurous vibe?

313
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,840
No.

314
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,560
Because you were sneezing profusely
into my eardrums

315
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,360
about the time the charge was made.

316
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,320
Nice work, Detective David.

317
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,840
Okay, the big plasma TV charge,
that's mine.

318
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,800
You know, sometimes
you just have to splurge

319
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,240
and get yourself something
that you enjoy, live a little.

320
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,800
Especially after a
long day at the office.

321
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,960
<i>I just have a cup of chai.
I mean, coffee.</i>

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,320
You're not fooling anyone.

323
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,400
You Californians are all into your tofu
and your sandals.

324
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
You're probably a Dead Head.

325
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,240
Am I right, dude?

326
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,680
Actually, I just prefer jazz.

327
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,040
All right, here's the question.

328
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,640
Jalapeños in your grilled cheese,
kicker or overkill?

329
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,360
- Kicker?
- Absolutely.

330
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,600
<i>Hello? You still there?</i>

331
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,240
And the charge to Delicious Delights?

332
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,440
Biggest amaretto cake known to man.

333
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,560
My mother was having a lousy week.

334
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,680
Sometimes you just want
to show someone you care. Right?

335
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,240
Right.

336
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,560
Okay, the last one. Um...
The charges from New World Video.

337
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,240
<i>Those were late fees.
I rented The Notebook. Don't laugh.</i>

338
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,120
Why would I laugh? I love that movie.

339
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,600
<i>I don't normally watch chick flicks,</i>

340
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,800
and I don't even know
if that classifies as one,

341
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,520
but you ever watch a movie and just think
that's the way things should be?

342
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,440
Like, someone puts themselves out there
for someone or something,

343
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
and either they get it or they don't.

344
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,920
But love's worth it.

345
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,560
Hi, this is Courtney Reese from CITYone.
May I help you?

346
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,120
I think that will
take care of it for now.

347
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,480
<i>If any more charges come in,
I'll be in touch with you.</i>

348
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,800
Great.

349
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,360
I failed to mention that you qualify
for our platinum card.

350
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,320
If you agree to a four-year term,

351
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,600
I can get you
a very attractive interest rate.

352
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,960
Four years? That's quite a commitment.

353
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,840
Just think of all the
ribs you could eat, sir.

354
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
You don't need to call me "sir."

355
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,040
I mean, hell, you know more about me
than my own mother.

356
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,080
<i>- Granger's fine.
- All right.</i>

357
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,120
Granger, be sure to contact us
if you want an upgrade,

358
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,560
and you should be expecting
a new card soon. Thank you.

359
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,120
Granger?

360
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,400
<i>Jennifer David. May I help you?</i>

361
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,360
I just wanted to thank you
for the cold remedy.

362
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,360
<i>It really did the trick.
It's me, Granger, by the way.</i>

363
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,800
I'm so glad. I was actually going to ask
how you were feeling.

364
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,480
Well, we do what we can do to help, sir.

365
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,840
<i>Granger, good night.</i>

366
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,080
Be careful, Priya.

367
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,040
- No, Papa.
- I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

368
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,000
Eh? This is the bathroom.

369
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,360
Do you need to use it?

370
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,960
- Have a look.
- No.

371
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,280
This is my bedroom. Our bedroom.

372
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,800
We're buying a brand-new double bed
with a brass headboard.

373
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,200
- Mother has already picked it out.
- Yes.

374
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,960
Oh! Uh...

375
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,080
Perhaps one day we'll have our own house
if we both work hard enough.

376
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,400
But we wouldn't have
my mother's fine cooking every day.

377
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,480
- She has many things to teach you.
- Yes.

378
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,840
So what sort of things do you like to do?

379
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,680
You know,
if you could live your life any way,

380
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
what would you want?

381
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,680
I'm pretty content
with things as they are.

382
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,440
Once I'm married...

383
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,000
We're married, I'll have everything.

384
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,240
A wife at home,
a beautifully tended garden,

385
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,520
when you're not busy
with our children, of course.

386
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,400
I love my job.
And as for children, I'm only 22.

387
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,840
There is time for us to live a little,
don't you think so?

388
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,560
But we will live a lot right here.

389
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,360
Look at that. That's not sexy?
That's what spots are these days, sex.

390
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,560
I have some vacation time,
so I was thinking.

391
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm gonna go with you on your trip.

392
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,960
Oh, and I thought that I...
Well, I thought that I could wear these.

393
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,880
You don't want to go.

394
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,520
You know, it's gonna be cold, foggy.
I'll be in a hotel room all day.

395
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,520
You're gonna need
some in-room entertainment.

396
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,440
I'm on business, Emory.

397
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,280
This account is important to us.
I can't be...

398
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,800
Fine.

399
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,240
- Fine.
- Em, I'm sorry.

400
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,960
No, you know what? Actually, I think
I'll take Mark Bailey up on his lunch.

401
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,440
I think he has a jet that he takes
to his oceanfront in Bermuda.

402
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,600
- You're trying to tell me something here?
- Yeah.

403
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,800
Nobody says no to Emory Banks.

404
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,040
<i>He has an amazing voice,</i>

405
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,280
<i>he says the most interesting things,
he's funny,</i>

406
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,840
<i>and he has such kind eyes.</i>

407
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,080
You looked up his picture?
- What if we were really soul mates?

408
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,840
Listen, you're just anxious about Vikram.

409
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,200
Trust me. When I was marrying Babu,
I thought my life was gonna end.

410
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,800
I mean, how can two people who
don't even know each other get married?

411
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,160
But then, a few months later,
we were laughing

412
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,840
at something really silly I'd done,
and I realized I'd fallen in love with him.

413
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,040
How sweet.

414
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,560
And it's easier than falling in love
with some random voice on the phone.

415
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,080
And seriously, this guy lives in America.

416
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,720
- There's no point.
- I know.

417
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,920
I've got to meet Karen.

418
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,920
Oh, and she made me swear
there'd be no strippers

419
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,680
at the bachelor party.

420
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,240
Well, if Karen said no strippers,
that means no strippers.

421
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,440
Only, I really want strippers.

422
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,800
She didn't say anything
about exotic dancers, did she?

423
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,080
No, she did not.

424
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,880
Mr. Granger, what can I do for you?

425
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,240
Hey, I just wanted to alert you
a future charge.

426
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,520
When Exotic Minx shows up, that's mine.

427
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,360
I think a pet should make you happy.

428
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,520
Do I seem sad?

429
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,200
Not always, but, you know,
you buy a lot of things,

430
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,080
and people do that
to make themselves happy.

431
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
<i>- I eat chocolate.
- Thanks, Doc.</i>

432
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,400
I'm actually hiring dancers
for a bachelor party.

433
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,680
You know, before the big wedding.

434
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,240
Are you getting married?

435
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,600
Me? No, no, no, no.
It's for my buddy, Charlie.

436
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,560
Party's probably gonna cost
a couple grand.

437
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Wow! So what happens
at these bachelor parties?

438
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
The usual things you hear about.

439
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,760
But, really, it's just a symbolic,
platonic representation

440
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,440
<i>of the last adventure
before one commits to marriage.</i>

441
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,320
I think it's actually a necessary journey,
a rite of passage, if you will.

442
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,320
<i>- I think everyone should have one.
- Me, too.</i>

443
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,480
Hey, listen, I'm going
to San Francisco next week for work,

444
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,000
and, you know, I thought maybe we could
get together and discuss my options.

445
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,360
Financial things can get so complicated
over the phone.

446
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,160
It's not really company policy
to do these things in person.

447
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,480
<i>Aren't you supposed to keep
the customer satisfied?</i>

448
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,360
Yeah, we love to satisfy,

449
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,960
but I may not be
in San Francisco next week.

450
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,200
I may be in...

451
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,040
I may be out of town
for a relative's birthday.

452
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,760
I have to go back to work now.

453
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,040
Okay. Well, you know,
you have my number if you stay in town.

454
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,080
Wow!
You can really see David Bowie tonight.

455
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,880
<i>- Sorry?
- In the moon. You've never heard that?</i>

456
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,480
You know, when there's a full moon,
you can see David Bowie's face.

457
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,360
Always...
Well, I thought it was Mick Jagger.

458
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,160
No, no, no. It's clearly Bowie.
You know, the cheekbones, the chin.

459
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,880
Well, thank you for using CITYone Bank.

460
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,960
Have a nice day.

461
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,480
Good night.

462
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,040
To the guy who said
he's never been anywhere,

463
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,120
I give you, Charlie Hendricks, the world.

464
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,920
Miss Russia.

465
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,720
- I'm from Ukraine.
- She's from Ukraine.

466
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,280
Miss Japan.

467
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,080
Miss...
From somewhere where they wear clogs.

468
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,760
No, no, no, no. This guy.

469
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,880
You deserve it, buddy.
You deserve the world.

470
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,200
Charlie!

471
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,920
Ladies, come on in.

472
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,280
Thank you.

473
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,960
<i>- Oh. That's too much.
- I'll pay, Baba.</i>

474
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,440
Don't be ridiculous.

475
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,160
Why not let her?
She makes more than you.

476
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,120
Aha!

477
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,440
You will make a beautiful bride.

478
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,160
<i>Thank you, Baba.</i>

479
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,000
<i>We'll take it. Oh, my beta.</i>

480
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,920
- Hello?
- Granger?

481
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,680
- Jennifer!
- Sounds like you're having fun.

482
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,080
Oh, it's a full-on rager.

483
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,160
<i>It's Charlie's big night,</i>

484
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,680
and the natives are a bit restless.

485
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,400
Next week, it turns out that I will
be able to meet you before the party,

486
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,360
so we can discuss the upgrade
we were talking about

487
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,680
when we were talking, before.

488
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,160
<i>That sounds great.</i>

489
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,080
I'd like that.

490
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,080
- It's the credit-card girl.
- Nice.

491
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,400
I'll be in San Francisco on Thursday,

492
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,720
so maybe we can meet
at the Hawksin Grand Hotel?

493
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,600
<i>- You know where that is?
- Word.</i>

494
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,440
Okay, let's say 6:00.

495
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,160
I'll be the dashing New Yorker
with unlimited credit.

496
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,080
It's a date.

497
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,120
I mean, Thursday is the date of the day
when we'll meet.

498
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,480
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

499
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,080
You know you're crazy, right?

500
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,480
Hmm.

501
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,680
What if this guy turns out to be
from a bad family and kidnaps you

502
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,680
and makes you clean their toilets and,
like, clean their dirty cats and all?

503
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,880
Then he's in real trouble.
I'm not a good cleaner.

504
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,200
<i>Bhaiya, Mumbai Airport.
Thank you, bhaiya.</i>

505
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,280
<i>Thanks, bhaiya.</i>

506
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,440
You know you're playing with matches.

507
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,920
Fire? Why can't I have a little of that?

508
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,520
Why can't I have
just one amazing last adventure

509
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,960
before I come back to Vikram?
This is my bachelor party.

510
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,680
I can't believe you're going all this way

511
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,680
to see if this deranged guy is your Tom,
Richard, Harry, Hank soul mate guy.

512
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,520
- I don't know.
- I promise you, I'll be back in two pieces.

513
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,560
- You better.
- Wish the stars to shine bright on me.

514
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,800
<i>Mummy, Papa, please don't faint,</i>

515
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,800
<i>but by the time you hear this,
I'll be on my way to America.</i>

516
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,400
<i>I know I should have told you,
but it was a last-minute decision.</i>

517
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,600
<i>I left my heart</i>

518
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,400
<i>In San Francisco</i>

519
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,000
<i>I've decided to attend
father's cousin sister's birthday party</i>

520
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,440
<i>in Palo Alto.
It's been a long time since I've seen them.</i>

521
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,080
<i>I'll send everyone your regards.
And see you in five days, maybe.</i>

522
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,240
Ouch!

523
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,160
<i>And please don't panic,
I'm using my own savings.</i>

524
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,280
<i>Papa, remember how you always wanted
your little daughter to travel</i>

525
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,280
<i>and learn different cultures?</i>

526
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,720
<i>This is your gift to me.</i>

527
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,320
<i>The morning fog</i>

528
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,640
<i>May chill the air</i>

529
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,840
Hello. Welcome to Hawksin Hotel.

530
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,560
- Have you got your passport on you?
- Yeah.

531
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,560
Great. Thank you.

532
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,840
You're the behind-the-scenes
creative guy.

533
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Yes, yes. No, and he knows why.

534
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,640
Mr. Hawksin.

535
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,880
Well, well.
Look who decided to get off their butts

536
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,040
and come fight for the job.

537
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
Never turn down a second chance.

538
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,440
The rooms are fantastic, by the way.
Thank you, sir.

539
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,080
- May I speak, sir?
- Only to say thank you.

540
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,520
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

541
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,480
- We're gonna knock your socks off.
- And then he ruins it by speaking again.

542
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,160
Didn't we talk about that?
Didn't I ask you not to speak so much?

543
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,680
Didn't I tell you to learn to listen?
Don't you want to be a nice boy?

544
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,280
Didn't I tell you to be more like him?
Here, watch this. Your hair is on fire.

545
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,800
But I don't want a Honda.
Learn from this.

546
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,000
Could you shut up? He doesn't like you.

547
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,440
He likes me.

548
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,600
I can't believe you're hooking up
with the credit-card girl.

549
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,680
No, wait, I believe it.
You're gutsy, pal.

550
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,680
I mean, what if she turns out
to be this lonely housewife

551
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,720
with four kids and bad teeth and gout?

552
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,120
It's just drinks.

553
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,960
Vibe?
- I got a good vibe.

554
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,080
Oh!

555
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
Just your type, 1 o'clock behind you.

556
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,520
- This one?
- Yeah.

557
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,240
Seriously.

558
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,680
That's her.

559
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,720
- I'm going in.
- Good luck.

560
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,600
- Excuse me, Granger Woodruff.
- Hi.

561
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,600
- You're not Jennifer David?
- No. But I wish I was.

562
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,720
Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

563
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,400
Excuse me, ladies...

564
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,720
You're not Jennifer David?

565
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,360
<i>- You didn't even talk to him?
- I couldn't, Zia.</i>

566
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,960
I was frozen, stuck, like gum.

567
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,560
Okay, so your crazy crush is over.

568
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,480
<i>Just come home, we'll watch
Fatal Attraction and you'll be fine.</i>

569
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,680
Listen, this guy was no good.

570
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,480
I'm sure he lied about those charges
and he spends money like a maniac.

571
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,760
He's not a liar.

572
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,880
And then he just, like, covers it all up.
It's just much better that you run now

573
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,880
than be hot-glued to the floor later.

574
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,520
Maybe I expected too much.

575
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,040
<i>Besides, he didn't even
get a chance to meet me.</i>

576
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,280
<i>If he did...</i>

577
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,040
You know, there was something
magical in our talk, Zia.

578
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,000
<i>- I promise you.
- Yes.</i>

579
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,800
I do think that the American slang
for that is "bullshit."

580
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,400
<i>- Just come home, okay?
- Bye.</i>

581
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,800
So, your girl stood you up.

582
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,640
Come out to dinner with me and Karen's
best friend, it'll be good for a laugh.

583
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,160
Discussing the intimate details
of bridesmaids' dresses

584
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,720
isn't my idea of a good time.

585
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,920
But you, my friend, you've got to take
this stuff seriously. It's your wedding.

586
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,880
Let me know how the bouquets work out.

587
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,080
Sorry. You okay?

588
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,680
- Gray...
- No, no, no, no. You... Do you see color?

589
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,680
Look, red bag. Red...

590
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,080
Keep the legs elevated.
I think you're gonna live.

591
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,080
- I'm all right.
- I'm really sorry.

592
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,400
- I didn't see you.
- No, I... I wasn't looking, I was...

593
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,600
No, no, no. It's my fault. I feel awful.

594
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,960
I wish you wouldn't...

595
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,680
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, I mean...

596
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,600
I wish you wouldn't feel awful.

597
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,120
So, are you here on vacation?

598
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,320
Yeah, from India. I'm visiting a relative
at Palo Alto, just for a party.

599
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,920
Hey, I know this might sound odd,

600
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,800
and considering the dangers
of being with me and all,

601
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,960
but you hungry?

602
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,520
I was gonna go out to dinner,
and I thought you might want to come.

603
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,120
Oh! Um...

604
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,640
That'll be nice, but only if it's ribs.

605
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,600
I read about this place in my guidebook.
You do like meat, don't you?

606
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,760
Yeah.

607
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,920
Mmm.

608
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,160
They're delicious, thank you.

609
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,360
Granger Woodruff, by the way.

610
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,760
Hello, Granger, I'm Priya Sethi.

611
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,240
Okay, Priya. You've got to just dig in.

612
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,480
Okay? Don't...
Don't worry about getting messy.

613
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,880
Just get it all over you.

614
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,120
Okay.

615
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,040
So, what do you do in Mumbai?

616
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,080
- I'm a nurse. Yeah.
- Nurse.

617
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,160
It's quite nice.

618
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,400
- Good food.
- So...

619
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,760
- Is this your first trip to America?
- Yeah.

620
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,960
I always wanted to come,
and it's much more than I've expected.

621
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,680
- You're on vacation?
- I wish.

622
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,880
I'm actually here for a business campaign.
I have this huge presentation next week.

623
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,960
Hey, maybe you can help me.
I mean, you're international clientele.

624
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,120
What attracted you to the Hawksin Hotel?

625
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,280
- A friend told me about it.
- So you go on personal recommendations?

626
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,400
I mean, do you ever just
want to take a chance?

627
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,640
You know, like... Like the feeling
of trying something different?

628
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,840
I take chances, but usually
I can never afford them.

629
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,600
Charge it, you know, charge everything.
Just pay for it later.

630
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,080
Just don't let it get stolen.

631
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,720
Did someone steal your card?

632
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,600
I have my ace credit-card girl
working on it.

633
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,480
She was actually supposed to meet me,
but she blew me off.

634
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,520
Yeah. When someone opts out
of a prearranged appointment.

635
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,040
- For what purpose were you to meet her?
- Just casual.

636
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,880
She sounded nice.

637
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
But her friends probably warned her
about meeting a complete stranger,

638
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,560
and she probably thought I was psychotic,

639
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,520
or maybe she just took
one look at me and ran.

640
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,040
Excuse me, I...
I need to go to the restroom.

641
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,560
Zia, it's me. Could you please connect me
to Granger? It's 4593330555.

642
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,720
Why do you want to talk to him?
I thought you blew him out.

643
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,480
I don't want him to think I was rude, and
actually, we're having dinner right now.

644
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,880
<i>- What? You told him you're Jennifer?
- No. It... It doesn't matter.</i>

645
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,240
<i>We're meeting as our real selves,
and it's better this way.</i>

646
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,560
<i>So, could you please
connect me to Granger?</i>

647
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,280
Priya, this can lead to no good.

648
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:25,080
Or it could lead to the perfect romantic
moment under the Golden Gate Bridge.

649
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,040
Listen, honestly, you've lost your head.

650
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,160
Hello?

651
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
Hello, Granger. It's Jennifer David.

652
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,920
Hey! Is everything okay?

653
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,280
I'm afraid when you didn't show up,
I signed up with the Visa girl.

654
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,000
<i>She threw in a hat.</i>

655
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,560
I wanted to apologize
about not making our appointment.

656
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,440
It turns out I'm out of town, after all.

657
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,080
That's cool. Maybe next time, then.

658
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,920
Very good. It...
It sounds like you're at a restaurant.

659
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,240
<i>- Teddy's Barbecue. You been?
- Yeah. I was there recently.</i>

660
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,400
Excellent ribs.
It's very romantic, isn't it?

661
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,640
Yeah. You know, since you stood me up,
I'm actually here with a nice girl.

662
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,240
Of course, I did smack her in the head,

663
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,520
which I wouldn't have done
if you did show up.

664
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,880
Well, have fun with your friend.
I'm sure she's quite lovely.

665
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,400
Inside and out. Not to be conceited for her.
Enjoy your evening.

666
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,720
- Good night.
- Good night.

667
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,800
Oh, wow, she's so good.

668
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,320
- Hello?
- Hello, sister. How're things there?

669
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
<i>- Ji, ask.
- Okay.</i>

670
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,840
What I wanted to know, sister...

671
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,800
Anji, just switch it off,
I can't hear a word.

672
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,240
Has finally Priya arrived there?

673
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,640
Priya? No. Priya isn't here.

674
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,080
Priya is not there?

675
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,680
One minute. One minute. Supposing...
Supposing she wants to give a surprise?

676
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,240
- Hang up. Hang up.
- Wait a minute, sister. What?

677
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,160
- Hang up the phone.
- She might want to give a surprise.

678
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,760
- Hang up. Hang up.
- I just can't hang up just like that.

679
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,760
- Quiet!
- Hang up.

680
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,160
<i>Haan, sister. In case Priya...</i>

681
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,880
In case Priya calls up,

682
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,080
just tell her that...
Just inform us, okay?

683
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,600
<i>Stop it, ji, stop it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hello, phone...</i>

684
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,640
He sounded very confused.

685
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,880
- Woodruff. Well...
- Mr. Hawksin.

686
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,200
I'd like you to meet my wife, Haejin.

687
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,960
- Hello.
- Hi. Granger.

688
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,160
I'd like to introduce you to a very good
friend of mine, Priya Sethi.

689
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,480
She's from Mumbai.

690
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,760
Mumbai.
That's the New York of India, right?

691
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,880
I hear there's quite an explosion
of jobs there.

692
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,120
I like to think of New York
as the Mumbai of America,

693
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,080
both with talented human resources.

694
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,320
- That's so sweet.
- Very impressive.

695
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,920
Well, we opened a hotel in Mumbai in '98,

696
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,360
the Hawksin Standard at Nariman Point.
Do you know it?

697
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,040
It's beautiful. The use of
steel and glass is breathtaking.

698
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,520
Thank you. We think so, too.
You're lovely. Isn't she?

699
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,280
- She's lovely.
- Yes, she is.

700
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,640
Has he invited you to our little shindig?

701
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,800
- I was just about to, actually.
- Good, good. Hold on a second.

702
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,600
Mary Pat, this young lady has come
a very long way to be with us.

703
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,400
Would you give her our nicest room,
with fruit basket, extra chocolates,

704
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,920
flowers every day? On my account.

705
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,440
Very good, Mr. Hawksin.
- That's very generous, sir.

706
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,840
Don't be silly.

707
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,600
So, we'll move you to 1740. It's a nicer
floor with its own concierge service,

708
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,280
and I'll put you under Mr. Hawksin's name
as his guest.

709
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,320
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

710
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,600
Not at all. One of the pleasures
of owning places like this,

711
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,080
doing nice things for nice people.

712
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,840
If you'll excuse us,
we'll say our good nights.

713
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,120
Good night.

714
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,160
- Good night.
- Good night.

715
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,840
Wow! I... You...

716
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,840
You know, he really...
I've never seen him act like that before.

717
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,760
- Yeah?
- That was amazing.

718
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,600
No, no.
Let me just get one thing right.

719
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,560
Aren't you supposed to be
Priya's best friend?

720
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,840
Yes, Mr. Sethi.

721
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,000
- Isn't she supposed to tell you everything?
- Yes.

722
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,440
Then why aren't you telling me
where she is?

723
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,200
Okay, maybe I should ask Miss Prasad.
Miss Prasad!

724
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,080
No, no, no. Mr. Sethi, please.

725
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,040
- I'll tell you.
- What?

726
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,800
- She's gone to meet a CITYone customer.
- Okay. Where?

727
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,120
- Mr. Granger Woodruff.
- Okay. An American?

728
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,920
- To America? Oh, my God!
- Oh, God. No...

729
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,600
- I should have never let her work here.
- No.

730
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,120
No, no, no! Mr. Sethi.
I promise you, she's coming back.

731
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,000
She had no intention to elope,
or anything of that nature.

732
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,840
- Elope? Who is talking about elope?
- Oh, God.

733
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
Oh, my God. I have to go.
I have to go and get her.

734
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,440
- I have...
- No, no, no, Mr. Sethi! No, no!

735
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,640
Mr. Sethi, I promise you,
she's coming back.

736
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,240
Morning, Priya.

737
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,160
Hey! Isn't it amazing?

738
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,920
- I love rain.
- Yeah, yeah. It's... It's great.

739
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,440
Hey, you're still going to meet me at
the restaurant tonight at 7:00, right?

740
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,240
Yeah.
Hey, is this a fancy party or something?

741
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,960
Well, you might want to wear
something nice.

742
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,360
I mean, not nice-nice. But, you know.

743
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,080
Yeah.

744
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,560
Well, I have some work to do,
but I'll see you tonight.

745
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,480
Great.

746
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,520
<i>Welcome to San Francisco International.</i>

747
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,120
Now, the moment we find our luggage,

748
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,840
- we'll go and find this Hawksin hotel.
- Careful, careful.

749
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,760
- Rajiv Uncle!
- Who's this man talking to me like this?

750
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,640
- I'm Sajarit from Punjab.
- Okay, how...

751
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,440
I know it has been a little while
since Navinda's wedding, but...

752
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,040
Your family owns that store in Hoboken.

753
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,240
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

754
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,520
<i>- And she's my wife, Neha.
- Hello, namaste.</i>

755
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,680
And you are here
for Rani Auntie's birthday.

756
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,680
Of course, of course,
and we are getting late

757
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,680
and we have to find a cab
and get our luggage first.

758
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,200
Come, come, come.
I'll give you a ride in my car.

759
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,080
No, no, no! We don't want a ride!

760
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,080
My parents will be furious
if I did not give a ride.

761
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,880
- Please, come with me. My car is quite big.
- No, no, no... It's fine, thank you.

762
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,400
My car is fast. Neha, please hold this.

763
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,720
- Okay.
- Come, come. Come, come, come.

764
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I'll help you.
- It's fine! It's fine...

765
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,400
It's so good to see you.
Come, please, excuse me.

766
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,040
And this is a most pleasant
surprise for us. Please accept tea.

767
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,320
We thought, since you were coming
all the way from here

768
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,320
to Mumbai for Priya's wedding,

769
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,840
we thought it was important that we also
show our respects, by coming to...

770
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,240
<i>Han ji. You know, but we are only sorry
that Priya and Govinda couldn't come.</i>

771
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,880
- Priya is visiting friends.
- Friends.

772
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,960
And Govinda, you know, so
busy with exams and cricket and all that.

773
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,920
<i>- His final exam's going on.
- Han ji. Han ji.</i>

774
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,400
Hi, sorry to disturb you.
Delivery for Priya Sethi.

775
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,320
- Really? Thank you.
- Here you go.

776
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,880
Anji, where is your boom box?

777
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,800
- She's asleep.
- Okay.

778
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,160
All right, we will find this Hotel Hawkskin
as quickly as possible.

779
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,880
- Yeah.
- There, we will divide,

780
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,280
locate Priya and take her home.

781
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,560
Pimmi, you will stay here.
If there's a problem, we'll call you.

782
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,200
<i>- No, no, no, no. I'm coming with you.
- Let her come, ji.</i>

783
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,080
- Okay. Huh?
- Rajiv? Where is he?

784
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

785
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,760
Oh, there you are.
Rajiv, please come down.

786
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,720
Anji wants to show her dance. She's been
practicing specially for Rani Auntie.

787
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,400
<i>But, Auntie ji's sleeping.
I don't think it's nice to disturb her.</i>

788
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,160
Let her sleep. She sleeps through
everything. You, come down. Come.

789
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,440
- Now?
- Oh, yeah. Why not?

790
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,760
- Right now?
- Oh, yeah. Right now.

791
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,280
Come on, she's all set with her music
in her hand. Please, Rajiv.

792
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,680
Come on, Anji. Play some music. Come on.

793
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,640
Shake it, Anji!

794
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,200
Isn't she wonderful, Rajiv?

795
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,400
Come on, do it!

796
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,720
Oh, I forgot. The Sawants are coming over
for dinner tonight.

797
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,600
<i>Some day</i>

798
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,760
<i>When I'm awfully low</i>

799
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,280
<i>When the world is cold</i>

800
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,480
<i>I will feel a glow</i>

801
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,600
<i>Just thinking of you</i>

802
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,800
<i>And the way you look tonight</i>

803
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,200
<i>Lovely</i>

804
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,640
Who's that?

805
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,640
Just a friend.

806
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,400
First impressions can be deceiving.

807
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,680
- The thing about this guy...
- Here we go.

808
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,960
...he's all casual charm
like nothing gets to him,

809
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,280
but really, complete softie.

810
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,840
- Yeah?
- In college,

811
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,960
he couldn't eat or sleep until this
girl he liked finally talked to him.

812
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,480
- I think he actually threw up afterwards.
- What?

813
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,280
The man knows
how to make an impression.

814
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,240
Wait, let me give you a little advice.

815
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,840
Don't listen to drunk Americans.

816
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,800
No, but I do agree with Charlie.

817
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,720
You know, there's something more
than what you really show.

818
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,880
What about you? Any secrets?

819
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,600
Are you an Indian movie star
hiding in America as a tourist?

820
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,920
Well, glad you could make it.
Enjoying yourselves, I hope?

821
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,720
- Definitely. Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

822
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,000
It's a wonderful party.

823
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,360
Same feeling as the rest of your hotels,

824
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,160
a magical oasis
that springs from nowhere.

825
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,240
It's so familiar.

826
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,640
We need you now.

827
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,240
Maybe I should hire her
for my ad campaign.

828
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,040
She's a smart girl.

829
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,600
- He's kidding, right?
- Yeah, he's kidding.

830
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,720
Have fun, buddy.

831
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,800
It's okay.

832
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,440
Look, but don't touch.
Look, but don't touch.

833
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,720
Do you know, when I was little,

834
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,440
I always wanted to find the golden ticket
in that chocolate,

835
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,680
like Willy Wonka,

836
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,720
so that I could go somewhere new.

837
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,920
I always wanted to know
who was gonna drink that chocolate

838
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,440
- after the fat kid fell in it.
- Yeah.

839
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,560
Did you just try to push me in?

840
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,640
That was a tap and you're too heavy.

841
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,880
You see,
I knew there was another side to you.

842
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,640
On the outside, you're the psychic,
sweet nurse from India,

843
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,480
but you've got a streak.

844
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,960
You're right.
There are things you should know.

845
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,200
- Talk. Talk.
- Are you mad?

846
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,040
- No.
- Talk.

847
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,680
I'll throw you in.

848
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,640
I forgot to watch out
for drunk Americans.

849
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,840
Oh, there you are.

850
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,680
Listen, I know, I know,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

851
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,480
Business first, I need you for a second.

852
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,200
One of us will be right back.

853
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,840
- Gee.
- What's up, buddy?

854
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,040
- I just put something together.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

855
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,760
Well, call me cynical,

856
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,200
but did you bring your Indian friend
Prius here...

857
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,040
- Priya.
- Whatever.

858
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,880
To show Hawksin you're some
free-thinking, international guy?

859
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,320
"Look at me, I'm dating an Indian girl."

860
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,880
Yeah, you...
You figured me out, Chuck.

861
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,760
Oh, yeah.

862
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,720
All right, all right.

863
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,720
Priya! Priya, wait!

864
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,640
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back.

865
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,440
I think I've served my purpose.

866
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,760
- What are you talking about?
- I hope I was impressive enough for him.

867
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,680
I heard you.

868
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,040
You only took me to the party
to make your boss happy.

869
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,520
Is that why you bought me this dress?

870
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,000
- So I wouldn't embarrass you?
- What?

871
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,680
No, no.

872
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,720
Okay, look, the thought did cross my mind

873
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,160
that bringing you to this party
would impress Kit.

874
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,080
- But the truth is, I think you're...
- Stupid.

875
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,360
Right?

876
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,720
Get into the car.
Both of you, get into the car.

877
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,280
Rajiv! Rajiv, where are you off to?

878
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,000
Priya called and asked us
to pick her up from the city.

879
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,120
We didn't want to
inconvenience you, so...

880
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,440
I'll also come with you, since you don't
know your way around here.

881
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,840
No, no, we've got the map.
Show her the map.

882
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,400
You've been already too generous, okay?
We'll return the car soon. Bye!

883
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
- Bye!
- Bye!

884
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,840
Who is it?

885
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,920
I don't have time
to eat your poisoned candy.

886
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,360
It's just a little poison.

887
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,120
Come on! Just one bite.

888
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,880
Did you read it?

889
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,080
No, I threw it away.

890
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,200
I heard your little fingers
peel back the wrapper.

891
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,360
Though, as I've witnessed,
your ears are far superior to mine.

892
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,040
It's American for "I'm sorry."

893
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,080
Did you steal it from the hotel lobby?

894
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,880
That is an outrageous accusation.

895
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,560
Okay, yeah, I did.

896
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,680
Okay, everything except the last thing.

897
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,640
You're right. I'm sorry.

898
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,400
At least let me give you a day
you'll never forget?

899
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,560
All right, I promised you a day
you're never gonna forget,

900
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,720
- and that's what you're gonna get.
- And your presentation?

901
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,920
I'm procrastinating.

902
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,880
Actually, I was hoping
you'd be my inspiration.

903
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,200
Wow!

904
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,240
Now, anything catches your eye,
just take a picture.

905
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,360
Okay.

906
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,800
<i>Pretty woman, walking down the street</i>

907
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,440
<i>Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet</i>

908
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,760
<i>Pretty woman</i>

909
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,160
<i>I don't believe you, you're not the truth</i>

910
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,960
<i>No one could look as good as you</i>

911
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,960
<i>Mercy</i>

912
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,440
<i>Pretty woman...</i>

913
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,480
I don't know.

914
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,120
Like hold the crab,
you need to get over your crab fear.

915
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,240
Nibbling.

916
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,240
<i>Pretty woman</i>

917
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:03,240
<i>That you look lovely as can be</i>

918
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,280
<i>Are you lonely just like me?</i>

919
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,760
<i>Oh, oh, pretty woman</i>

920
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,400
So, in India do your parents pick out
who you're gonna marry?

921
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,160
Look at that.

922
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,800
Yeah, in a way.

923
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,520
Well, probably cuts down
on a lot of bad dates.

924
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,440
- And a lot of good ones.
- That's true.

925
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,480
But, you know,

926
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,680
people learn that love grows.

927
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,920
It's not like a rose
already blooming in a flower shop.

928
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,120
Well, what if you get
one of those plants that,

929
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,280
you know, you take home,
and after like two days, it just dies?

930
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,200
Better luck next life.

931
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,200
Look at you.

932
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,240
Probably find Priya under Granger.

933
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,280
I mean, you know, the chances of you
finding your name are basically

934
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,720
the same as finding mine...
I'm gonna shut up now.

935
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,160
- So, Mr. Cook...
- Yeah.

936
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,800
What about dinner somewhere different?

937
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,640
- I'm game.
- Yeah?

938
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,840
Better.

939
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,960
This is great.

940
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,360
Thank you.

941
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,960
I should tell you that

942
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,800
- I've never had Indian before.
- I know.

943
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,680
But I'm glad
you're trying out something new.

944
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,560
So just dig in, don't even think about it.
You might just love it.

945
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,280
- Not bad.
- See?

946
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,880
You know, if you ever
wanna impress an Indian family,

947
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,760
you should tell about the things
you really love.

948
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,200
You know, family, education,

949
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,000
food, marriage, you know,
stuff like that.

950
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,400
So, your parents putting pressure on you
to get married?

951
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,240
I'll marry someday, you know.

952
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,960
Mmm.

953
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,040
- Let me try.
- No, leave that!

954
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,360
It's really spicy.

955
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,240
It's very spicy.

956
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,160
- Some more?
- No.

957
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,560
Mmm-hmm. Mmm...

958
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,760
I'm fine.

959
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,240
- Has your tongue cooled down?
- What tongue?

960
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,760
How will you make your little jokes now?

961
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

962
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,480
Are you being sassy?

963
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,760
You've been here, what, three days,
and you've already picked up sass?

964
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,920
Couldn't you just take home a magnet
or a T-shirt?

965
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,120
- I always wanted to swim in the ocean.
- What? No, no, no.

966
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,120
You go for it,
but I have to warn you, it's...

967
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,400
- It's kind of cold.
- It is not!

968
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,120
Easy.

969
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,600
- Okay, come on.
- No, no. I'm not going.

970
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,120
- Are you scared?
- Yeah, I'm scared.

971
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,280
- You are?
- There's sharks in there.

972
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,400
Oh, yeah? I'm a shark then.

973
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,760
<i>It's all I wanna do</i>

974
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,960
<i>Give you the strength to hold on</i>

975
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,760
<i>When we are apart</i>

976
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,080
<i>I give to you my heart</i>

977
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,520
I've had a really great night.

978
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,120
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

979
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:12,000
<i>Because of who you are</i>

980
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,240
<i>You're beautiful</i>

981
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:23,920
<i>You're beautiful to me</i>

982
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,680
<i>Yeah</i>

983
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,520
<i>You're beautiful</i>

984
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,800
<i>You're beautiful to me</i>

985
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,680
If you could live your life any way,
what would you want?

986
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,600
Like any way.

987
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,120
What would I want?

988
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,400
Mmm-hmm.

989
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,200
You mean besides a dance by the water
with a beautiful woman?

990
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,040
All right.

991
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,640
You still have to answer my question.

992
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,880
I was hoping I could charm my way
out of answering.

993
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,120
Okay, give me a second.

994
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,040
I guess I don't wanna die a failure.

995
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,720
What do you mean?

996
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,280
That I didn't try hard enough
or something.

997
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,080
Like with my job. You know,
I want to be the best at what I do.

998
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,280
The scary part is putting yourself
and your ideas out there.

999
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,400
What if you crash and burn?

1000
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,000
Isn't it worth it?

1001
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,200
Deep down I guess I'm afraid
it won't work out.

1002
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,120
What about you?
Did you always want to be a nurse?

1003
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,480
No. I...

1004
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,600
I guess I want to do things
that make people happy.

1005
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,520
Well, maybe you should do something
that makes you happy.

1006
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,880
Turn left, turn left.
Left, left, left, left.

1007
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,880
Right! Right! Right, right.
- Right, right.

1008
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:27,240
No, I don't think so.
- Bye, girls.

1009
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:31,200
All you told me to get into this right
and now we're stuck in one-way street.

1010
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,760
<i>Ji, you were driving straight
on that crooked street.</i>

1011
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,120
<i>Achha, listen. Why don't we ask
one of these nice gentlemen to help us?</i>

1012
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,360
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Can you help us please?

1013
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,240
Excuse me. Could you please tell me
where is this Hawksin Hotel?

1014
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,320
- Hi, handsome.
- Okay, handsome.

1015
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,080
Can I interest you in some group sex?

1016
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,600
What?
- No, no, no, no. Don't, don't...

1017
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,960
Hawksin Street, where is that?

1018
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,200
Excuse me, we just wanted to know
where is the... No, no, no, no.

1019
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,240
We don't like that. No, no.

1020
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,560
Come on, let's go party.

1021
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,440
- Driving. Driving.
- Let's go!

1022
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,280
Excuse me.
I was wondering if you've seen a girl,

1023
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,720
age 23, height is... How much?

1024
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,280
- Very pretty.
- Very pretty.

1025
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,400
And she was seen here in your hotel
with a gentleman,

1026
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,360
and I think the meeting
was quite explicit.

1027
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,920
I'm sorry, sir, but I can't comment
on the activities of any of our guests.

1028
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,120
Excuse me. Did you say you were looking
for a young Indian girl?

1029
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,760
Yes! Yes, yes, yes.

1030
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,320
I think I know the girl. I should,
I gave her a hotel room last night.

1031
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,960
Pretty girl.
No, I'm saying good-looking kid.

1032
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,040
Oh, my God!

1033
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,720
Wait a minute.
Is this about me paying for it?

1034
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,760
'Cause I'll be honest with you,
I do it all the time.

1035
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,800
You are the one who has
kidnapped my daughter!

1036
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,000
Hey, kidnapped? Take it easy.
Buddy, she wanted it.

1037
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,600
- She liked it.
- Yeah.

1038
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,840
Is she with you?

1039
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,240
No, no, no. I was with her last night.

1040
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,400
Tonight she's probably with a guy I know.
Maybe two, he's got a partner.

1041
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,280
- Where is my daughter?
- Hey, hey!

1042
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,280
Where's my daughter?
- You wanna call somebody?

1043
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,920
<i>- Leave me!
- No, ji!</i>

1044
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,120
No!

1045
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,880
This is outrageous!

1046
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:28,600
Well, thank you for a very memorable
and very wet evening.

1047
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,920
- I had fun today.
- Me, too.

1048
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,600
Good night.

1049
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,800
Unless, you know, you want to

1050
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,960
grab a drink.

1051
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,760
Do you know they charge $8 for a cola?

1052
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,920
Oh, uh...

1053
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,040
I need to get out of these wet clothes.

1054
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,240
In my room.

1055
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,960
With me.

1056
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,360
Good night.

1057
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,800
Night.

1058
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,240
<i>Zia, I called you at work today,
but you were not there.</i>

1059
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:32,880
I just want to let you know
that I think I am in love.

1060
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,560
And I don't wanna marry Vikram.

1061
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,680
Something could happen with Granger.

1062
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,920
I have to go to my cousin's party today,
but then I will tell him about Vikram.

1063
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,520
So, what's going on
with you two, anyway?

1064
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,560
Nothing.

1065
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,160
She's going back to India on Monday.

1066
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,000
- And, what, you go back to Emory?
- I don't know.

1067
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:06,160
You know,
Emory, she looks good on paper.

1068
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,280
I just never really felt it with Emory,
you know?

1069
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,640
No.

1070
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,240
Thanks for driving me.

1071
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:26,120
Well, Palo Alto is pretty far. I don't
know how else you were gonna get there.

1072
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,720
No, I wanted to.

1073
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,800
So, do you have to leave tomorrow?

1074
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:42,120
I mean, I know we just met
and this probably sounds crazy,

1075
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:46,240
but maybe you could stay longer.

1076
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,600
You know, I just got my presentation
but after that...

1077
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,320
For how long do you want me to stay?

1078
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,320
I don't know.
I didn't really think about it.

1079
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,160
Uh...

1080
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,160
- This is the exit.
- Okay.

1081
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,760
So...

1082
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,520
Which way do you wanna go?

1083
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,000
I don't know.

1084
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,720
Okay, well, you've got a 50-50 shot.
Right or left?

1085
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:25,400
I'm sorry. Right.
No, I mean, go left. Left.

1086
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,840
Left it is.

1087
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,800
- Granger...
- Yeah?

1088
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,720
- It's the second house on the right.
- Oh, okay.

1089
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:59,120
I would invite you inside,
but I have a rather crazy family.

1090
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,120
Who doesn't?

1091
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,480
So, are you gonna need a ride back?

1092
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,960
Um...

1093
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,240
I'll see what's going on inside,

1094
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,000
I need to spend some quality time
with my family,

1095
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:15,240
and I'll call your cell
once the quality is over.

1096
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,720
- Hey, don't you want my number?
- I have it.

1097
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,600
I don't ever remember
giving you my cell phone.

1098
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:28,000
Yeah, right, I don't have it. I guess
I was thinking about somebody else.

1099
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,360
Uh...

1100
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,560
I'll call you at the hotel, yeah?

1101
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,520
- So, I'll see you after your thing?
- Yeah.

1102
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,400
Call me.

1103
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,720
- Bye.
- Bye.

1104
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,920
You did not just say that. "Call me?"

1105
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,520
Auntie.
- Priya!

1106
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,760
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

1107
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,840
- Hi.
- Hi.

1108
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,160
Do you remember me?

1109
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,360
Come, let me show you around.

1110
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,880
You must eat something.

1111
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,720
Pretty girl like you, your future husband
could have something to grab on.

1112
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:34,760
Yeah, Auntie.

1113
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,760
I heard you're doing very well,
working for a big American company.

1114
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,200
- Your family must be very proud of you.
- I think so.

1115
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,440
Priya!

1116
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,120
Hello?

1117
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,960
Hi, I'm Granger. Nice to meet you.

1118
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,640
It's so nice, Papa,
that you've come for the party.

1119
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,640
Not another lie.

1120
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,560
Hi. How are you?

1121
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,480
Hello, hello.

1122
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,720
Granger Woodruff.

1123
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,920
I know why you are here
and it's certainly not for the family.

1124
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,960
Now where is the man
you've eloped with, huh?

1125
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,440
<i>- What?
- Ji, ji, I think that is him.</i>

1126
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,080
Priya, you left this in my car.

1127
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,840
I don't want you
to address my daughter, okay?

1128
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:42,960
Papa.

1129
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,600
Mr. Sethi. Granger Woodruff.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

1130
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,920
What pleasure? Where is the pleasure?

1131
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,960
Granger, thanks for the present.
Can I talk to you later, please?

1132
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,480
No.

1133
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,560
I want to know what you told my daughter
to lure her to America.

1134
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,280
- What? What's your father talking about?
- Can we go to your car?

1135
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,960
You thought you will bring
an innocent girl here

1136
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,080
and I will not find you?

1137
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,720
Sir, sir, I just met your daughter
a few days ago.

1138
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,440
I'm not trying to lure her anywhere.

1139
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,160
- You are her customer.
- Papa...

1140
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,880
I mean, for the credit card company.
Don't you lie to us. Zia told us everything.

1141
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,560
Thank God,
Vikram's family does not know anything.

1142
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,640
Otherwise, you know
what could have happened.

1143
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,960
Credit card company?

1144
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,080
Yes, that horrible job
which makes her work the whole night

1145
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,000
<i>pretending to be an Americano.</i>

1146
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,920
Are you discussing Priya's job?
She does a fantastic American accent.

1147
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,320
Come on, do your Streisand voice.
It's just terrific.

1148
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,040
I'm sure your fiancé must enjoy it.

1149
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,800
You're engaged?

1150
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,240
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He's not asking as a jealous boyfriend,

1151
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:50,480
he's asking merely
as a polite conversation starter.

1152
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,160
Priya!

1153
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,800
Priya! Where are you going?

1154
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,040
Look, I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what the hell is going on.

1155
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,720
Granger, not here, please. Come.

1156
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,960
You wanna tell me
who you really are?

1157
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,560
I'm Priya Sethi, I live in Mumbai,
just like I told you.

1158
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,360
And who else are you?

1159
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,360
I'm Jennifer David
from CITYone Bank Business Processes.

1160
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,240
Say something else. Say something else.

1161
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,680
I'll be happy to assist you
in increasing your credit limit,

1162
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,160
if you wouldn't mind
answering a few questions.

1163
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,200
Okay, all right, I got it.

1164
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,320
I'm sorry.

1165
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,480
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was going to.

1166
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,160
I didn't think you'd like the real me.

1167
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,680
You're engaged, is that how
they celebrate in your country?

1168
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,080
I don't love him. I...

1169
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:05,080
I'm sorry I didn't tell you everything.
I pretend for my job.

1170
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,920
But the truth is everything else
I've told you.

1171
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,960
I don't know what to believe.

1172
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,240
You know what? Forget it.

1173
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:25,200
Yeah, I've known you
for, what, a few days?

1174
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:30,240
Let's not blow this thing out of proportion.
It was fun. Let's just leave it at that.

1175
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,920
Granger, please...

1176
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,960
Damn it!

1177
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,120
Stay away
from my daughter, okay?

1178
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,720
Who is that guy?

1179
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,120
Oh, my God.

1180
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,080
I always imagined Indian parties
to be peaceful affairs.

1181
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:10,440
<i>You know, Gandhi-esque, incense
and Kama Sutra.</i>

1182
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,520
Never have expectations.

1183
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,680
- You know what your deal is?
- No, what's my deal?

1184
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,280
You never totally put yourself out there.

1185
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,360
You round the corners
and you play it safe.

1186
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,520
You never let people
see who you really are,

1187
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,520
but you're selling yourself short, man.
Tired of watching you do that.

1188
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,560
If you want big rewards,
you have to take the big risks.

1189
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,560
But you're afraid,
so you wind up with nothing.

1190
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,320
Wow! This girl really took you out.

1191
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,520
So what? I'm just supposed to tell her
to leave her fiancé

1192
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,320
and move to America to be with me?

1193
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,720
I don't even know
if I'm gonna have a job next week.

1194
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,240
She pretended to be someone she wasn't,

1195
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,000
maybe that's who she needed to be
to have her big adventure.

1196
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:57,760
Haven't you ever pretended to be someone
you're not, Granger?

1197
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,920
For the last 37 years at
Hawksin Hotels, it's been our passion...

1198
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,680
- Happy birthday.
- Emory? What are you doing here?

1199
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,800
Well, I came to wish
you a happy birthday.

1200
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:31,120
Well, it's not my birthday,
and I thought we broke up.

1201
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,640
I forgive you.

1202
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,160
- Good luck, Priya.
- Thank you.

1203
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,920
Emory, I...

1204
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Em... Em, Em, I can't do this, okay?

1205
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,800
I'm here for work,
I don't have time for this.

1206
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,320
Okay, whatever. You know,
it's actually probably for the best.

1207
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,800
Since I wouldn't want
to remember us both naked when I do it.

1208
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,680
- Do what?
- Propose, you jerk.

1209
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,200
What?

1210
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:07,080
- You're joking, right?
- No, and that better not be your answer.

1211
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,960
I just thought, you know,
we were seeing other people.

1212
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:16,080
- You know, Mark Bailey, private jets.
- Let's review, sweetie, okay?

1213
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,760
We are both good-looking.
We both went to Ivy League schools.

1214
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,760
The sex is amazing.

1215
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,280
You make it sound like a merger.

1216
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:32,800
You're never going to find anyone
better than me, and you know it.

1217
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:34,960
Em, Em...

1218
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,360
Priya.

1219
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,920
Before you close your door, please...

1220
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:57,440
I know I should have had told you
I was engaged. I'm sorry.

1221
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:04,600
But the truth is,
maybe I did come all the way

1222
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,720
wanting a romantic moment
with someone I've never met

1223
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,320
because maybe I was running away
from my life.

1224
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:18,280
And then I met you, my feet stayed still.
Maybe they floated a little.

1225
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,160
I couldn't leave tomorrow
without you knowing how I feel.

1226
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,640
- And I hope that maybe you've...
- Grange?

1227
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:33,200
Is my fiancé bugging
you for towels again?

1228
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,000
- It's not...
- Necessary.

1229
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,560
Oh, and we're not going
to need turndown service later

1230
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,320
because, well,
we're just going to mess it up.

1231
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,320
Just give me a minute, Em.

1232
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,520
Hey!

1233
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,360
You don't need to explain it to the maid.
It's a hotel, for gosh sake!

1234
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,880
- Look, I'm...
- That's right.

1235
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,960
I should have looked,

1236
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,960
then I'd have seen what a hypocrite...

1237
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,080
That's the English word, right?
Someone like you.

1238
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,880
You're going back to India to your fiancé.
What do you want me to do?

1239
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,960
You'll like this one.
So these two lawyers go to heaven,

1240
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,200
and they meet Saint Peter...
You guys heard of Saint Peter?

1241
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,680
Let's just walk around
the man in the towel.

1242
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,120
Which reminds me,
those are the 300 count cotton towels.

1243
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,600
Egyptian cotton, too,
I think it's the best.

1244
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,760
<i>At Hawksin Hotels
we help you to be who you need to be,</i>

1245
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,440
<i>so you can be who you

1246
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,800
<i>Hawksin Hotels.</i>

1247
01:18:55,880 --> 01:19:01,440
<i>For 80 years we've had just one passion,
doing nice things for nice people,</i>

1248
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,720
<i>nice people like you.</i>

1249
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,920
So what do you think, Mr. Hawksin?

1250
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,800
I loved it.

1251
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,480
- Welcome to the Hawksin family, boys.
- Yes!

1252
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,760
- Thank you very much, sir.
- "Nice people like you."

1253
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,440
- I like that, it's a good touch.
- Thank you, I got it...

1254
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,840
What is the meaning of all this?

1255
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,560
- You're home so soon?
- Wow, full on rager.

1256
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,000
Who told you you could have a party?
And what are you celebrating?

1257
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,120
Ow!

1258
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:13,360
That's it. My children are hooligans.
I've done nothing right.

1259
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,560
Just go to weeds.

1260
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,040
Oh, no, please, please, please,
one minute.

1261
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,000
He is probably following
the example of his sister

1262
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,760
to see who can humiliate the family more.

1263
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,120
He with the party or she who ran away
to America with some stranger.

1264
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:26,040
Definitely the one who ran away.

1265
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,440
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing happened?

1266
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,600
You spent all your money
just to go to America?

1267
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,400
Thank God, the only blessed thing
that has happened

1268
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,120
the Bhatias have not found out.

1269
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:37,480
Oh, by the way,
Mr. Bhatia had left a message.

1270
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,400
He found out what happened
from Uncle Sawant.

1271
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,760
<i>Dad, Dad.
- Ji, ji, ji, ji, you're going to have a stroke.</i>

1272
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,920
Tomorrow, you're going to Bhatia's place,
kiss their feet

1273
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,800
and apologize
for what you have done, okay?

1274
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,640
And beg forgiveness with the hope
that they let this marriage take place.

1275
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,400
- What if...
- Not, what if, anything.

1276
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,840
The only thing you're supposed to see

1277
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,120
is to obey your father and most probably
that future husband of yours.

1278
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,880
Now go to your room.

1279
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,600
- Papa.
- What?

1280
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:06,960
Please try to understand,
I don't want to marry Vikram.

1281
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,480
Papa, Vikram is a perfectly nice boy.

1282
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,080
It's just, I know he won't make me happy.

1283
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,840
What? What did she say? Happy?

1284
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,240
You think I was happy
when I met your mother?

1285
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,120
I mean...

1286
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,120
But now, just look at us,
we have grown to be happy.

1287
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,800
Till our children came to make us crazy.

1288
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,560
So don't you talk to me
about being happy.

1289
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:37,920
All my life I've been thinking
about making other people happy.

1290
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,760
Now, I need to know what makes me
happy. Not you, you or Vikram.

1291
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,360
What is this me, me, me?
Crazy American talk!

1292
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:49,240
Okay, okay. Priya.
You see, you are part of a family.

1293
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,240
And you are not entitled to hog
all the happiness just for yourself.

1294
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,160
There are other people in this family
who also want to be happy.

1295
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:01,960
But what you've done all this time?
Just break our hearts.

1296
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,320
<i>- Ji, ji, ji...
- No, no...</i>

1297
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:10,480
<i>Ji, you're not feeling well.
I'll talk to her, huh?</i>

1298
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,800
Priya...

1299
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,240
Look, Priya.
This marriage is not just about you.

1300
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,560
It is for us.

1301
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,120
<i>This will help our family, beta.</i>

1302
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,120
Look at your father.
See how hard he works.

1303
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,680
This is important, Priya. Huh?

1304
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,360
<i>Family's important, beta.</i>

1305
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,200
It is who will always
be there for you, huh?

1306
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,800
<i>This is the air I breathe</i>

1307
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,720
- Knock, knock. Hi.
- Hey.

1308
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:07,240
Look, I know we haven't had a
chance to talk, really, since San Francisco.

1309
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,000
You know, I wanted to tell you that if
the wedding stuff is too much for you,

1310
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:13,200
let's just celebrate
your new account, okay?

1311
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,760
Look. It's your favorite.

1312
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:26,920
- It's not working.
- What, did you lose the account?

1313
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,800
Right.

1314
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,760
Okay.

1315
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:48,400
Once again, and make it sound
this time like you mean it.

1316
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:52,520
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Louder, louder.

1317
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,280
I'm terribly sorry, Uncle, Auntie.

1318
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,800
I've gotten everything out of my system.

1319
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,960
And I assure you
I'm ready to be a devoted...

1320
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,160
Devoted wife and mother.

1321
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,280
I'm ready to devote myself to...

1322
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,720
Come on.

1323
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:18,640
I'm ready to devote myself to my job
and finding things that make me happy.

1324
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,400
'Cause I lied. I haven't gotten
everything out of my system.

1325
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:27,240
What system?
She's too young to have a system.

1326
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,960
She's nervous.

1327
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,680
She's embarrassed and she's afraid

1328
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:37,680
because she thinks that
you will not accept her apology.

1329
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,960
Isn't that right, Priya, huh?

1330
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:46,160
I'm sorry. Vikram is a lovely person.

1331
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,960
And I know, Vikram, you'll find someone
who'll make you happy.

1332
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,440
But I don't believe it's me.

1333
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,440
I know I'm disappointing you.

1334
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,840
It's just, something happened
when I was gone.

1335
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,400
I jumped in the ocean.

1336
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,960
I got sick eating chocolates.

1337
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,760
I just fell in love.

1338
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,440
Is this man here with you?

1339
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,600
No, Vikram. It's just...

1340
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,160
I realize I need something else.

1341
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:25,600
I told you they're all mad as hatters.
Didn't I? Didn't I?

1342
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:28,120
How dare you do this to our son?

1343
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,080
- It's not enough that you...
- Now, that is okay.

1344
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:34,200
We have a whole file
full of girls in there.

1345
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,880
And I really always wanted to
meet Lavina from Gwalior.

1346
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,640
No, it's not all right, Vikram.
It's not all right.

1347
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,000
This little tramp runs off to America,
then stands here and breaks your heart...

1348
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:49,720
She's not a tramp! She's not a tramp.

1349
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,480
She's a dreamer.

1350
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,800
Her ideas are modern.

1351
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,920
Yes, sometimes she's
stubborn and willful,

1352
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,400
but when she walks into a room,
people smile.

1353
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:12,080
When she talks, people listen.

1354
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,360
She's wise. She's kind.

1355
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,520
And most importantly, she's my daughter.

1356
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,440
And I love her.

1357
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,680
Papa.

1358
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,400
Thank you.

1359
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,440
<i>This is the air I breathe</i>

1360
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,440
<i>Hello, everyone. I'm Priya Sethi.</i>

1361
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,200
<i>I'm also known as Jennifer David.</i>

1362
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:51,080
I've recently taken over from Miss Prasad
who was promoted to Regional Manager.

1363
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,200
<i>So, I welcome you all to
CITYone Business Processes.</i>

1364
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:01,000
<i>As you all know, you'll be spending
12 hours of your day</i>

1365
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,280
as an American.

1366
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,400
<i>You'll have an American name,</i>

1367
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,400
<i>an American city of residence,</i>

1368
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,200
<i>but it's very important to remember
that you're not an American.</i>

1369
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:23,360
You're an Indian and your
American identity is simply there

1370
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,520
<i>to make it easier for
you to communicate</i>

1371
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,080
with the person
at the other end of the line.

1372
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:35,760
But you must leave it at your desk
the moment you take off the headset.

1373
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,800
<i>I'm desperate for you</i>

1374
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,280
Excuse me, everybody. It's time
for the customary best man speech.

1375
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:56,800
When Charlie and I were 14,
we went to Camp Whichiwawa

1376
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,160
and being the mischievous
little fellows that we were,

1377
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:04,400
one night we decided to
sneak across to the girls' cabins.

1378
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:08,800
Now, the only way to get over to Camp
Whichiwuwu was over this little river.

1379
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:14,120
Now, to the 14-year-old me, in the middle
of the night, it looked like the Mississippi.

1380
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,040
You know, so I say to Charlie,
I say, "Dude, I'm not going in there.

1381
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:22,760
"It's probably full of snakes and eels
and crocodiles,"

1382
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,640
and by the time I'd finished
listing all my reasons,

1383
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,560
Chucky boy here was already
on the other side.

1384
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:31,760
I chickened out
and went back to the cabins.

1385
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:36,560
But Charlie here,
he forged ahead to the girls' cabins

1386
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,440
and he met a young lady that night,
believe it or not.

1387
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,640
A young lady named Karen Miller.

1388
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,600
Now, when Charlie got back to the bunks,
he says to me, he says,

1389
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:51,120
"Dude, dude, I just met the girl
I'm gonna marry."

1390
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:58,200
Flash forward 10 years later, Charlie and I
are at a barbeque at Massapequa or

1391
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:04,480
Quitipeak or Quahog or somewhere,
then he sees her across the room.

1392
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,480
Now, Charlie was on a date that night,

1393
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,000
but he left her just like he left me

1394
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,600
on the other side of that river
10 years earlier.

1395
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,920
And me being the voice of reason,
I say to Charlie, I say, "You can't leave,"

1396
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,640
and he turns to me and
he says something I'll never forget.

1397
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:23,320
He says, "Nothing should ever hold a man
back from his future."

1398
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,720
Nothing should ever hold a man
back from his future.

1399
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,920
So, to my best friend, Charlie,
who wasn't afraid to cross the river,

1400
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,400
and to Karen,
who was waiting for him on the other...

1401
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,760
I gotta go.

1402
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,760
Taxi! Hey!

1403
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:23,440
How're you doing?
Airport. As fast as you can.

1404
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:29,360
<i>Hear me out, don't tear away
'Cause this is what I'm trying to say</i>

1405
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:34,000
Hey, hey, would you mind stepping on it?
I got to get to the airport in 40 minutes.

1406
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,520
Hey, dude,
I'm trying to go as fast as I can.

1407
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,960
Okay, thank you. Okay, thanks.
Very important.

1408
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,080
- Appreciate it.
- Sure.

1409
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,960
Hi, hi, yes,
I need information for Mumbai, India.

1410
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,520
Yeah, I can hold.

1411
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:52,680
Yes, yes, I'm here. I'm looking for the
address to CITYone Bank Headquarters.

1412
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:57,240
C-l-T-I, yes, yes.

1413
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:01,360
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.
I can't understand you, I...

1414
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,240
- Hold, hold on, please.
- Come on!

1415
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,960
- Excuse me, hey, buddy...
- What?

1416
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,520
Would you mind translating
for me, please?

1417
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,040
Okay, just because I'm brown and driving
a taxi doesn't mean I can speak Indian.

1418
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,320
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean that.

1419
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,080
Dude, I'm playing, I'm playing with you.
Give me the phone.

1420
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,800
- Thanks, man. Thank you.
- It's all right.

1421
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,880
CITYone Bank address, Headquarters,
Mumbai.

1422
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:28,040
I can write down. I have a pen.

1423
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,600
<i>I can't see your face</i>

1424
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,720
<i>You're calling out my name</i>

1425
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:40,680
<i>I can hear you calling out my name</i>

1426
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,560
Hey. Watch it.

1427
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,680
<i>I can't see your face</i>

1428
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:48,080
<i>But you're calling out my name</i>

1429
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:56,360
<i>And all this time you let me run</i>

1430
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:02,600
<i>Look how fast time has gone</i>

1431
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:08,240
<i>Looking back at what we had</i>

1432
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,400
Hey, buddy.
Can't this thing go any faster?

1433
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,440
Can your cab go any faster?

1434
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,560
Stop and let me out.

1435
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,680
CITYone Bank.

1436
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,720
I'd be glad to help you with that.

1437
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,840
For security purposes, could you please
give me the last four digits of your social...

1438
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,680
No, you listen to me.
No, sir, you listen to me.

1439
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:09,600
Just listen here, Jack.
You better pay up or else...

1440
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,320
He hung up on me.

1441
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,920
Balveer, you must always remember.
They are your customers.

1442
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,160
So, do not let things get personal.
This is a business, right?

1443
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:23,480
And your job is to be professional,
calm and helpful.

1444
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,160
But we must get the money.

1445
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,960
How can we let these obnoxious
Americans talk to us like this?

1446
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:31,400
What happens if the obnoxious American
is also a complete idiot?

1447
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:40,960
And he's sorry it took him so long
to realize what a mistake he made.

1448
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:44,200
How did you...

1449
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:48,360
Well, I had to body check an old lady,

1450
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,240
employ a taxi cab translator, don't ask,

1451
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,640
fly 18 hours,

1452
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,960
hijack a tuk-tuk,

1453
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,080
and bribe a street gypsy,

1454
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,840
and I did it all in this monkey suit.

1455
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,240
I kind of feel like James Bond.

1456
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Only I probably don't
smell as good as he does.

1457
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:17,200
- I think you smell great.
- Thanks.

1458
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,920
I couldn't get married.

1459
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,720
Well, it's a pretty big deal.

1460
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,480
Sort of like a platinum card.

1461
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:43,000
Once you make that commitment,
you really have to see it through.

1462
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,400
But I think I'd like that.

1463
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,800
Kiss him. Kiss him.

1464
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,000
You sure
this is such a good idea?

1465
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:17,040
Don't worry, it'll be good.

1466
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,120
Best of luck.

1467
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:29,160
Sir, before you take a swing,
there's something I want to read to you.

1468
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,280
Try English, boy. You're hurting my ears.

1469
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:57,120
I just wanted you to know that I have the
utmost respect for you and your family.

1470
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:03,720
And I promise to treat your daughter with
all the love and respect she deserves.

1471
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,680
<i>You like alu parathas?</i>

1472
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,760
<i>Let's give him alu parathas.</i>

1473
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,080
Sit, sit.

1474
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:38,960
<i>Wise men say</i>

1475
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:45,920
<i>Only fools rush in</i>

1476
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:52,160
<i>But I can't help</i>

1477
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:59,240
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

1478
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:07,360
<i>Shall I stay</i>

1479
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:13,840
<i>Would it be a sin?</i>

1480
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:21,320
<i>If I can't help</i>

1481
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:27,640
