1
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:29,695
Welcome to the
oven, aka Camp Carolina:

2
00:01:29,695 --> 00:01:32,457
our home away from home
in this godforsaken country.

3
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,866
What I can't convey,
via this video journal

4
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:41,203
is the incredible heat
and the local smells.

5
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:44,272
Oh, my God, it stinks.

6
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:46,075
Yo, Mustangs!
Yo!

7
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,031
On 3, give me a smile!

8
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:50,640
1, 2, 3!

9
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,972
But let me introduce myself.
My name is Angel Salazar.

10
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:57,200
Private Salazar.

11
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,466
I'm that poor Latino filmmaker

12
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,808
that did not get into USC.

13
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,225
Hey! Papi Chulo, what's
goin' on over here, man?

14
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:04,374
<i>Ai! Qué chulo!
Enter McCoy.</i>

15
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,793
<i>Hace calor!</i>

16
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,171
I'm tryin' to make a video.
Oh, yeah? Tryin' to make--

17
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,744
You know what just happened
to your video? Yeah?

18
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:12,276
Just got a whole hell of a
lot sexier, baby.

19
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:13,964
Yes, it did. Sexy is here.

20
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:15,805
Making a video of me
making a video of you.

21
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:17,954
Yeah, yeah. You're making a
video of me making a video of you.

22
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,526
Uh-huh. Why is that?
Getting it all down

23
00:02:19,526 --> 00:02:21,483
because this might be the last
video that either of us makes.

24
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:22,902
Is that so?
Mm-hmm.

25
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:24,398
Well, I'll tell you what.
Let's make a deal, then.

26
00:02:24,398 --> 00:02:26,662
You and me. Seriously.
All right.

27
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:30,651
If I die in this war, I want you
to get all my videos, all right?

28
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,646
Okay. And if you die in this war,

29
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:34,986
I'll get your videos,
your camera,

30
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:36,214
and your girlfriend's
phone number.

31
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:37,249
My girlfriend's number?

32
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:38,400
Yeah, your girlfriend's
phone number.

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,513
What's Mrs. McCoy going
to be saying about that?

34
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:40,740
This is my brother.
Come on, man.

35
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,083
All right, that's a deal.
Who do you think I am?

36
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,385
That's a deal. You know
what I like about you, Sally?

37
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:46,725
Yeah?
Besides absolutely nothing?

38
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:50,906
Absolutely nothing. And your
sweet and sunny disposition.

39
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:53,975
No, no, no. It's not about
sunny disposition, McCoy.

40
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:55,433
It's about
telling it how it is.

41
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,737
Oh, is that what it's about?

42
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:58,003
It's about telling it
how it is.

43
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,768
You want to hear telling it--
Hey, hey! Hey!

44
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:01,724
Over here, over here.
Please.

45
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,256
Focus on what's beautiful.
Thank you.

46
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:06,059
Do you want to hear me
telling it how it is?

47
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:07,939
Y'all want to hear
telling it how it is?

48
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,857
What do you all think's
gonna be the first casualty

49
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,314
of this entire conflict, huh?
You.

50
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:13,309
That's right!

51
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:15,151
It's not going to be
Rush or Flake

52
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:17,683
or "Don't ask, don't tell"
over here.

53
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:18,987
You know what it's gonna be?
What?

54
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:20,406
Do you know what it's
going to be? Talk to me!

55
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:21,826
You know what it's gonna be?
What's it gonna be?

56
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,897
It's gonna be the truth.

57
00:03:23,897 --> 00:03:26,621
Come on, now. Just
tellin' it like it is.

58
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,194
You suck! What are you talking about?

59
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:29,805
Ah, here endeth the lesson.

60
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:33,948
That was some sad,
depressing stuff right there.

61
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,789
All right, let me finish.
Let me finish.

62
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:38,206
All right. So I joined up
to get the money for college,

63
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,817
and a better chance
at film school. Yeah.

64
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:42,809
I mean, I'm going to be a combat
vet, for chrissakes, right?

65
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:44,996
And with this awesome war film
in hand, they got to take me.

66
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:46,377
Oh, yeah.
So while I'm over here,

67
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:48,257
I'm gonna be shootin'
whatev--

68
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:50,673
...whatever the fuck goes on.

69
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:52,208
Which so far-- Get--

70
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,663
Which so far
is basically nothing.

71
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:57,502
Now, our squad mans
a checkpoint outside Samarra.

72
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:59,995
It's all day long
in the boiling hot sun,

73
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:01,530
wearing 120 pounds of gear,

74
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,292
checking out cars for
weapons and bombs and shit?

75
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:07,016
This deployment is
unspeakably underwhelming.

76
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:08,588
The only insurgent
we found so far

77
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:10,890
is one big fuckin' rat we
chased out of here last night.

78
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,885
Oh, that rat died.
So, get-- Get off.

79
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,304
'Cause I fucked it
to death.

80
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:15,992
So don't be expecting
any Hollywood action flick.

81
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:17,450
It's not going
to be smash cuts,

82
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,253
no adrenaline-pumping
soundtrack,

83
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:21,593
no logical narrative to
help you make sense of it.

84
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:23,396
Basically, here,
shit happens.

85
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,510
You want soda?

86
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,661
No. No.

87
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:54,272
I scored some
for one M.R.E.

88
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:55,845
Just go.

89
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:58,530
Go on. Get out
of here. Go on.

90
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:02,405
Jesus.
He doesn't let up.

91
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,850
As you
see, we set up road signs.

92
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,001
They're vividly colored,
highly visible,

93
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,459
and impossible to miss.

94
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:56,415
They're written
in English and Arabic,

95
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:58,027
and they inform
every single driver

96
00:08:58,027 --> 00:09:00,674
that they're entering
a checkpoint.

97
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:47,818
Get out of the car.

98
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:50,618
Come up over here.

99
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:51,846
Quickly.
Let's go, people.

100
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:54,186
Go, quick!

101
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,336
Get in line here.

102
00:10:58,214 --> 00:11:00,055
Right there.
That's it, that's it.

103
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:02,357
Let's go, people.
Yell out.

104
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:08,188
Arms up.

105
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:16,934
Arms down. Tell him
to open the trunk.

106
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:19,696
Open the trunk.

107
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:25,374
Let's go, people.
Come on.

108
00:11:25,374 --> 00:11:27,829
Come on, move.

109
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,383
Don't go in. It's open, it's
open. Take your hands out of there.

110
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:41,677
Is he afraid of the dog?
Afraid of the dog?

111
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:44,363
Who gives a fuck?
Fuck him.

112
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:46,511
Come over here.
Come over here.

113
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:49,848
Come on, stay in line.
Eyes front.

114
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,671
Sally?
All right, Blix.

115
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:00,436
The car is yours.
Good. Come here.

116
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:02,776
Come back, come back here.
In there. In there.

117
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:04,349
In there. Okay.
Up here, up here.

118
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,610
In. In. In, in, in.
In. In, in, in, boy.

119
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,446
Come on. I need you
in there. In there.

120
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:18,236
Come on, boy. Wait.
Up here. Up here.

121
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:21,228
In there. In there. Up
here. Up here. Come on.

122
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:22,878
Good boy, Kevin.

123
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,681
Good boy, Kevin.
Good boy.

124
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:25,831
All right, come here.
Back through here.

125
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:29,054
It's all clear. All right.

126
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:32,161
Tell them they can go in
the car and drive off slowly.

127
00:13:13,553 --> 00:13:16,967
That's Gabe
Blix. He's from Virginia.

128
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:19,768
He doesn't talk a lot 'cause he's
got his nose in a book all the time.

129
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:21,571
Yo, Gabe, what you
readin' over there?

130
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:23,182
I'm reading a book,
Salazar.

131
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:24,947
All right.
What's it about?

132
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:27,747
It's about-- Dude, no,
seriously. What are you doing?

133
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:30,010
What are you doing right
now? Who are you? I'm--

134
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,622
I want to get your opinion.
Okay, if you have that camera,

135
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:34,384
then you're part of the media,
and we're under strict orders

136
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:36,647
not to speak with you, yeah?
Don't call me media, asshole!

137
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:38,565
Come on, just tell me what
you're reading. Tell me about it.

138
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:40,982
Dude, no. You're gonna make some, kinda
like commie rendition of our mission--

139
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:43,821
Hey! No, no, no, no, no.
This is about the truth, bro.

140
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:46,276
This is about what's going
down. This is the truth 24/7.

141
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:49,421
This camera, it never
lies. Yeah, the--

142
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,263
Dude, that is bullshit.
Okay?

143
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,375
'Cause that's all
that camera ever does.

144
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,986
Just show me
the title of the book.

145
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:58,245
"Appoin--" Really?
All right. So, you know,

146
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:01,313
what's it got to say
about Samarra? Nothing.

147
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:02,771
Nothing.
No, nothing.

148
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:05,994
It's about this, like, guy,
he's this country club guy,

149
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:08,142
and he gets really drunk
on Christmas Eve,

150
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:12,822
and he throws his drink
in his boss' face.

151
00:14:12,822 --> 00:14:14,702
And everybody in the whole
city that he lives in,

152
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:16,236
like right outside
of Philadelphia--

153
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:18,576
Okay, but what's it
got to do with Samarra?

154
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:21,568
It-- Nothing. The opening
makes reference to Samarra,

155
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:25,481
but besides that, you know, it's
just like, classic cover situation

156
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:27,399
What? Don't judge a book by its cover.

157
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,857
Right.
Basically.

158
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:33,038
All right. So, uh--
Whoa, when's the appointment?

159
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,803
You don't want to know.
I do want to know!

160
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:36,338
Dude, you don't-- This is about books!
I don't have anything about books.

161
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:38,486
This is literary.
This is good.

162
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:42,821
The appointment, uh-- Do you want
me to just read you the introduction?

163
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:46,503
Perfect. Perfect.
Give me something good.

164
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:47,808
Okay, let me find it.

165
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:49,381
The introduction's
actually not by John O'Hara.

166
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:51,260
It's by W. Somerset Maugham.
Perfect.

167
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,099
And-- You have no idea
who that is, do you?

168
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:56,132
Not at all.
Didn't think so. Okay.

169
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:58,511
<i>It's called Death Speaks.
Oh, wait, it's spooky?</i>

170
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:00,314
All right. Read that
right into the camera. Go.

171
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:02,193
All right."There was
a merchant in Baghdad,

172
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,421
who sent his servant
to market to buy--"

173
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:05,492
All right, Gabe, wait.
Before you start reading that,

174
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:08,178
once you get into it, think
about what you're gonna say,

175
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:10,211
and then put some like,
you know, some heart behind it.

176
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:12,091
Go!

177
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:15,275
"There was a merchant in Baghdad
who sent his servant to market

178
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,653
"to buy provisions,
and in a little while,

179
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:19,533
"the servant came back,
white and trembling,

180
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:20,799
"and said, 'Master, just now,

181
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,988
when I was
in the marketplace'--"

182
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,637
Yeah, this is a little bit
boring, bro. This is like--

183
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:26,553
I need to-- Dude, I don't
even want to do this.

184
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:28,816
Hey!
Yeah.

185
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:31,003
I got reading, too.

186
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:39,673
Okay. All right, kid.
I win. Get out of here.

187
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,974
<i>Come on, go.
Emshe, emshe.</i>

188
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,468
Find your
mother. Go find your mother.

189
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:45,810
No.

190
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,690
<i>I don't need any hajji
slave, all right?</i>

191
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,225
I get you anything.
You want soda?

192
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,951
No. I don't want any
fuckin' soda.

193
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,524
Hey, hey. Sally, Sally!

194
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:55,708
Ain't you supposed to be saying
"action" on me, or something like that?

195
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,470
All right. Here we go.
I'm Master Sergeant James--

196
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,659
Ohh!

197
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,574
It stands for M.R.E.:
"Meals Refusing to Excrete."

198
00:16:02,574 --> 00:16:05,797
What you doin', Sally?
God damn, man! That's shit.

199
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,945
You're asking for this.
Hey, hey, Sally!

200
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:09,825
Come on, now.
All right, you ready?

201
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:13,277
I'm Master Sergeant James
Sweet-- Over here.

202
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:15,004
Hey.
What's he lookin' at?

203
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,226
Boy! Get out of here. Hey.

204
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,451
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Full security. Full security.

205
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:23,750
<i>Hey, Ishta! Ishta!</i>

206
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,435
Ish-motherfuckin'-ta.
Hey, hey. Hey!

207
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:29,734
Get over here, Blake.
Oh, oh!

208
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:32,573
Don't be givin' your
fuckin' food, man. No. No.

209
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:35,259
<i>Ishta. Ishta.
Go. Go.</i>

210
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:39,171
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

211
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:40,898
Stay away from anything
and everything

212
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,471
these little midget Ali Babas
give you, all right?

213
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:44,465
Yo, why not, Master Sergeant?
Why not?

214
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:46,690
See, my black ass has been over here
for three goddamn tours, all right?

215
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,721
I don't trust
anybody over here. Shit.

216
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:51,102
How long have you been
over here, Flake?

217
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:53,020
Just a couple months.
Just a couple of months.

218
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,437
Shit. Got ourselves
a goddamn virgin here.

219
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:57,815
Oh!
No, I'm not a virgin

220
00:16:57,815 --> 00:16:59,235
Yeah, all right.
I bet.

221
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,651
And what'd you do before that?
I just hung out, you know?

222
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:04,413
Fucking around.
Gettin' drunk.

223
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:05,641
Tried to stay out
of jail.

224
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:07,022
Sally, come on over here.
Look at this miserable fuck.

225
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,288
This one?
Yeah.

226
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:10,398
Got him. Probably suckin'
dick for beer money,

227
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:14,042
if it wasn't for the Army.
Oh.

228
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:16,229
Look, you're right. I was
suckin' dick for beer money.

229
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:17,878
This here is the cream of
the Army recruits, right here.

230
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:19,796
Ouch.
"Cream" is no joke.

231
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:22,098
You're so goddamn white, boy, you
wouldn't wear yourself after Labor Day.

232
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:23,748
All right, tell me, Flynny.

233
00:17:23,748 --> 00:17:26,433
Tell me. Like, what was it? You either
had to serve time here or stateside?

234
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:27,852
Something like that.
Yeah.

235
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:29,847
Well, you want to get
your ass back in one piece?

236
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,612
I most definitely do.
Well, good.

237
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:33,415
Stop lookin' to get
yourself killed, then.

238
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:36,982
You chow down on anything these
little motherfuckin' ragheads give you,

239
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:39,169
it's like swallowin'
an IED

240
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:41,816
I wa-- It's a date.
Look at this.

241
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:43,120
Do you think I want
to eat this?

242
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,000
I wasn't going to eat this.
I was trying to be friendly.

243
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:46,611
They don't want
to be your friend, slick.

244
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:48,798
They want to piss on your back and
tell you that it's raining, all right?

245
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:50,677
Look, trust me. You eat that
shit, and next thing you know,

246
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:52,174
you gonna be
spittin' up blood.

247
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:53,938
Hey, look alive,
soldier. All right?

248
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,662
We get back to the house, get yourself
a little kitty kitty, how 'bout that?

249
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,618
Woof-woof!
How can you arrange that?

250
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:01,189
Look alive, look alive! This right
here is my motherfuckin' Caucasian.

251
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,838
<i>He's mine too!
You're my motherfuckin' ese.</i>

252
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:05,025
<i>I am your ese?
That's right. Come on.</i>

253
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,214
Yo, Master Sergeant.
What?

254
00:18:06,214 --> 00:18:07,825
We swept by this place
yesterday, right?

255
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:11,623
Hell, yeah. Bet your ass we're
gonna do it again tomorrow.

256
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,579
Because when
the sun goes down,

257
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:15,996
<i>these motherfuckin' hajjis
come out their ratholes</i>

258
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,720
and resow their IED's in different
and more surprising places

259
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,137
than the day before,
and you can bet your ass

260
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:24,589
that these smilin',
soccer-playin' shitbirds

261
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:27,351
ain't nothin' but
their eyes and ears.

262
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,637
Slow down! Slow down.
Slow it down. Hey! Stop!

263
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:54,662
Stop the fucking car!
Stop! Stop the goddamn car!

264
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:58,191
Sally, we got one! Stop!
Stop the god--

265
00:19:58,191 --> 00:19:59,841
Sal!

266
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:09,201
What the fuck?
Jesus Christ. Holy shit.

267
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,568
Get back!
You got to get back.

268
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:47,026
<i>Ishta, ishta.</i>

269
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:51,322
Back 'em up, Sally.
Let's go. Come on.

270
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:53,087
<i>Ishta, ishta.</i>

271
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:55,657
Move back from the car!

272
00:22:47,174 --> 00:22:51,049
Say hello to
B.B. Rush and Reno Flake.

273
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:55,691
Flake is your average grunt, completely
in touch with his primal self,

274
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:57,110
He's one of our
latest recruits

275
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,949
from way down on the bottom
of the gumbo barrel.

276
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:03,286
Boy, he discovered
his soul mate: B.B. Rush.

277
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:05,856
The guy's dumber than
shit, but he's loyal.

278
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:07,851
Now, they only want
two things here:

279
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:09,808
to fuck or to fight.

280
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:13,797
And yesterday, Flake blew
away his first civilian.

281
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:15,485
Yo, Flake,
what you readin'?

282
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:20,012
Oh, yeah?
You been gettin' any?

283
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:22,697
Mm.
No.

284
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:27,224
All right.
I have.

285
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:28,528
All right, fine.
Yo, Flake.

286
00:23:28,528 --> 00:23:32,326
<i>How do you feel about
that hajji you smoked?</i>

287
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:35,817
Well--

288
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:40,689
All I know is, the only language
these sand niggers understand is force.

289
00:23:40,689 --> 00:23:43,067
And I'm just the cat
to make the introductions.

290
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:45,254
Fuckin' Roger that, man.

291
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:49,895
Oh, but the truth be told?
Truth be told, Flake.

292
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:55,496
Truth be told. Truth is, it wasn't
everything it's cracked up to be.

293
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:59,563
I mean, I thought my first
kill shot would blow my mind,

294
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,097
but--

295
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:03,514
It was nothing.
It was like guttin' catfish.

296
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,309
Yo. Sarge, you waved
that guy to stop, right,

297
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:10,189
<i>that hajji retard?</i>

298
00:24:10,189 --> 00:24:12,989
Oh, yeah. This guy, uh--

299
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:16,173
Yeah, but the problem is that
most of these fuckin' people,

300
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:18,168
you know, when you put
your hand up?

301
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:19,741
They don't know that
that means to stop.

302
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:22,541
You know, most of these Iraqis
think that you're wavin' hello.

303
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,306
But they fuckin' know what
it means now. All I know is...

304
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:26,224
these cats screamed
their heads off,

305
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:28,142
screamed his little,
lady lungs out,

306
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,441
you screamed your beaucoup
brains off-- Ha ha.

307
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:33,666
And that car just kept comin',
right across that trigger line.

308
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,006
What the fuck else am I
supposed to do but light 'em up?

309
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:38,193
Light 'em the fuck up.
You did your job.

310
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:40,188
All right.
But, you know, Flake,

311
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,914
you're not gonna win
many hearts and minds

312
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,372
pumping pregnant women
full of lead, though, right?

313
00:24:43,372 --> 00:24:46,594
That's true, Sally.
Come on. Salazar.

314
00:24:46,594 --> 00:24:50,507
I mean, what do you want me to do?
Get all teary-eyed and say I'm sorry?

315
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:59,253
"I'm so sorry."

316
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,849
My life's been
changed forever?

317
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:08,844
My life's been changed
forever, fuck.

318
00:25:08,844 --> 00:25:12,335
<i>Waxing hajjis is like
stomping cockroaches.</i>

319
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,329
I've been there. I've done
that, and it makes me thirsty.

320
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,247
So how about
a nice, cold beer?

321
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:21,426
God damn!

322
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:24,150
So Flake--
It's the next fuckin' shipment.

323
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,835
Flake, there's no remorse, now
that you know that she's pregnant?

324
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:29,367
Now that you know that she had
a child in her womb over there?

325
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,362
Nothin'?

326
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:35,735
You really have
no remorse.

327
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,385
I don't know what the fuck
I'm supposed to--

328
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:39,034
How am I supposed to--
You have no second thoughts.

329
00:25:39,034 --> 00:25:40,530
I have second thoughts.
Let me tell you something:

330
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,142
you have a kid, you have
a wife that's pregnant--

331
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:44,712
Hold up. Hold up. No, no, no, hold
up. You'll have second thoughts.

332
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:47,320
You can't afford remorse, okay?

333
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,893
You get remorse, you get weak. I'm
not saying you didn't do a good job.

334
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:51,655
You get weak, you die.

335
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:52,959
As simple as that.
He did his fuckin' job.

336
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,571
What are you saying?
You have a kid,

337
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:56,796
you have a pregnant wife, you
become more of a human being.

338
00:25:56,796 --> 00:26:00,709
If you have a kid, you're gonna be
even more on your fuckin' plan then.

339
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:03,087
Because you can't afford-- I'm
not saying you're not on your plan.

340
00:26:03,087 --> 00:26:04,813
...not to go home
without diapers.

341
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,578
What the hell
is wrong with you?

342
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:08,496
How do we know that
her-- the fuckin'... Hey!

343
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:10,452
How do we know if the bun
in her fuckin' oven... Hey!

344
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:13,790
At ease the shit, all right? Look,
point in fact, he did his job.

345
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,401
Rules of engagement states

346
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:17,818
if they cross the trigger line,
he kills 'em.

347
00:26:17,818 --> 00:26:18,777
That's fuckin' right!

348
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,618
Hey! Get the fuck
away from him!

349
00:26:20,618 --> 00:26:23,380
Sarge, how the fuck am I
supposed to see in there? How?

350
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,723
Have a fucking heart.

351
00:26:24,723 --> 00:26:26,871
Get in your fucking rack!
Enough.

352
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:28,712
Everybody go to bed,
all right?

353
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,321
Does anybody have
a fucking problem with that?

354
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:33,546
Enough.
Shut the fucking camera off!

355
00:26:33,546 --> 00:26:35,196
All right, all right.

356
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:38,955
Ten-hut!

357
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:41,257
Okay, guys. You've all
done a tremendous job,

358
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:43,712
and I wanna personally thank
each and every one of you.

359
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,477
Colonel Ford, permission
to speak, sir?

360
00:26:45,477 --> 00:26:47,011
Go ahead.
Thank you.

361
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:49,351
We just wanted to thank you
for your kind words, and, also,

362
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:51,729
there have been some rumors circulating
about a possible follow-up mission.

363
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:54,070
No, no, no. I haven't heard
anything about that.

364
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,788
But it does look like we have to keep
up the work here just a little longer.

365
00:26:58,788 --> 00:27:01,627
Longer, sir?
How much longer?

366
00:27:01,627 --> 00:27:04,235
As long as it takes, Private!
That's what you're here for!

367
00:27:04,235 --> 00:27:06,959
Now buck the fuck up!
Yes, sir!

368
00:27:08,302 --> 00:27:10,143
I just got orders.

369
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:13,979
Second Battalion of 727
is pinned down in Baghdad.

370
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:16,473
They can't replace us
till someone replaces them.

371
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:21,191
So half a company will have to
temporarily remain here in Samarra

372
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:25,564
to man the checkpoints and
keep a lid on insurgent traffic.

373
00:27:25,564 --> 00:27:28,979
<i>You know what it's like? I swear
to God, it's like that Clerks movie.</i>

374
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:31,319
You know, where the guy
has to work on his day off,

375
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,930
and all kinds
of crazy shit happens,

376
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,311
and all he keeps thinking is,

377
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:36,766
Oh, man, I'm not even
supposed to be here today.

378
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:39,298
None of us are supposed
to be here. Fuck, man!

379
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:41,216
We're just asking
to get waxed.

380
00:27:41,216 --> 00:27:43,057
Dude, all I'm saying is,
they just keep saying,

381
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:44,630
"All right.
You're going home tomorrow."

382
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,510
And the next day,
it's the same shit.

383
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:47,661
You're going home tomorrow.

384
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:49,233
Fuckin' on and on,
week after week.

385
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,305
"You're going home tomorrow."
And we're still here, man.

386
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:52,341
We're like sitting ducks.

387
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:53,683
Take care of this,
Sergeant.

388
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:55,563
Fuckin' Sally, get
that camera out of my face!

389
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:58,287
What the fuck is your problem?
What are you bitching about?

390
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:00,205
What, because they
extended our deployment?

391
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:01,970
Big fuckin' surprise!

392
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,003
Welcome to the goddamn Army!

393
00:28:04,003 --> 00:28:06,381
We all want to fuckin'
go home! We can't.

394
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:09,182
So stand the fuck up
and be a fucking man about it!

395
00:28:09,182 --> 00:28:11,100
Drive on with
a fuckin' hard-on! Yeah?

396
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,977
Let's go!

397
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:16,087
Coming here is one step closer
to that appointment.

398
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:18,081
What'd you say, Gabe?
I said, every fucking day here

399
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:19,961
is one step closer
to that appointment.

400
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:21,572
What?

401
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:24,871
That book, the one that I read to
you, the one that was so boring,

402
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,636
you should check it out.

403
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:35,766
"Death speaks.

404
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:37,953
"There was a merchant
in Baghdad

405
00:28:37,953 --> 00:28:40,485
"who sent his servant
to market to buy provisions.

406
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,518
"And in a little while,
the servant came back

407
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:44,129
"white and trembling,
and said,

408
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:47,198
"'Master, just now,
when I was in the marketplace,

409
00:28:47,198 --> 00:28:48,847
"'I was jostled
by women in the crowd,

410
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:51,955
"'and when I turned, I saw
it was Death that jostled me.

411
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:54,410
"'She looked at me
and made a threatening gesture.

412
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,906
"'Now, lend me your horse,

413
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:58,630
"'and I will ride away from
the city and avoid my fate.

414
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,543
"I will go to Samarra.
There, Death will not find me.'

415
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:05,688
"The merchant lent him his
horse, and the servant mounted it,

416
00:29:05,688 --> 00:29:07,453
"and he dug his spurs
in his flanks,

417
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:10,522
"and as fast as the horse
could gallop, he went.

418
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:11,903
"Then the merchant
went down to the marketplace,

419
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:13,591
"and he saw me
standing in the crowd,

420
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:16,123
"and he came to me and said,

421
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:18,041
"'Why did you make a
threatening gesture to my servant

422
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:20,496
"when you saw him
this morning?'

423
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:23,181
"'That was not
a threatening gesture,' I said.

424
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:25,291
"'It was only
a startled surprise.

425
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,669
"'I was astonished
to see him in Baghdad,

426
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:31,736
for I had an appointment
with him tonight in Samarra.'"

427
00:29:43,052 --> 00:29:46,083
<i>¶</i>

428
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,768
<i>You awake? Wake up.</i>

429
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:10,519
<i>Runnin' over there.</i>

430
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:35,876
White chocolate?
No.

431
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,718
Milk chocolate?
Absolutely not.

432
00:30:37,718 --> 00:30:39,559
And dark chocolate.
Dark chocolate.

433
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,093
Those would be
your three wishes

434
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:43,625
if you found a magic lamp under
one of these fuckin' rocks.

435
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,080
And speaking of
dark chocolate, Salazar.

436
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,881
Hi.

437
00:30:54,673 --> 00:30:58,164
<i>Oh, man. Oh, man.</i>

438
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:04,647
Ew! It's no good. Dude.

439
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:07,256
Fuck that!
Give me back my shit!

440
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:10,977
Snowflake, goddamn it, man!
That's my last one! Fuck!

441
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:14,084
Jesus! Guys, guys, do
not make a fucking move!

442
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:16,962
Goddamn it! What the fuck
is behind your eyes?

443
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:19,187
My brain, Sergeant.
You know what I think?

444
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:22,064
Hey, Flake, get over here.
Stand right here.

445
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:24,749
Look alive, Soldier.
Sal, are you getting all this?

446
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,897
I'm getting all of
it. Ask me what I think.

447
00:31:26,897 --> 00:31:28,355
What do you think,
Master Sergeant?

448
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:30,580
I can't help but think
that Rush ain't gonna make it.

449
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,191
Now, are you listening to
me, Soldier? Yes, Sergeant.

450
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,032
But are you hearing me?
I'm hearing you, Sergeant.

451
00:31:34,032 --> 00:31:35,413
Goddamn it, boy.
You're so dog ugly,

452
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:37,140
a bullet to your face
would be an improvement.

453
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,636
Now listen up--

454
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:41,053
Fuck off, Sally. ...as I
educate your boots on the ground.

455
00:31:41,053 --> 00:31:44,122
This ground, this very
terrain that you are at present

456
00:31:44,122 --> 00:31:45,733
brainlessly bobbing
your fat ass over--

457
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:47,344
Are you listening to me, Rush?
Yes, Sergeant.

458
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:48,763
But are you hearing me?
I'm hearing you, Sergeant.

459
00:31:48,763 --> 00:31:51,449
Then slow the fuck down!
Reconnoiter.

460
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:53,712
Recon the area.
Take a look around.

461
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,052
Now answer me this:
Did you or did you not

462
00:31:56,052 --> 00:31:58,239
check out this furniture
here yesterday?

463
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,389
No, Sergeant.

464
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:00,847
Why not?

465
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:02,267
Because it wasn't here
yesterday.

466
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:05,336
That's exactly my point.
So stay the fuck away from it!

467
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:06,947
Now, look, we came here
in one piece,

468
00:32:06,947 --> 00:32:08,098
and you can bet your ass

469
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:09,785
we're gonna leave here
in one piece, all right?

470
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:10,975
Roger that, Sergeant.
Look alive, Soldier.

471
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:12,087
Roger that, Sergeant.

472
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,123
All right. Come on.

473
00:32:13,123 --> 00:32:14,427
Let's get our asses
out of here.

474
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:16,959
Goddamn it, Rush!

475
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:19,836
Shut up!
Fuck!

476
00:32:19,836 --> 00:32:23,711
Oh, fuck!

477
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:33,915
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

478
00:32:47,763 --> 00:32:53,249
<i>And this shit hole is nothing
but a fuckin' deathtrap.</i>

479
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:54,975
<i>Oh!</i>

480
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,277
<i>We need to get
the fuck outta here.</i>

481
00:32:57,277 --> 00:32:58,888
<i>Yeah.</i>

482
00:32:58,888 --> 00:33:01,650
<i>Nuke it and pave it
over, you know?</i>

483
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,108
<i>Pave the whole
fucking thing, man.</i>

484
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:06,561
<i>Vaporize every last sand
nigger. Goddamn right.</i>

485
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:10,435
<i>Sweet's the only guy-- the only
guy that ever gave a shit about us,</i>

486
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,392
<i>and they torched him--
they fucking torched him!</i>

487
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:14,502
<i>Hey, man, if they had
fuckin' sent us home</i>

488
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:16,074
<i>when they was
supposed to, huh?</i>

489
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:20,026
<i>Sweetness'd be alive, right?
Partying with us right now.</i>

490
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:21,944
<i>They're fucking killing
us off one by one.</i>

491
00:33:21,944 --> 00:33:23,516
<i>That's why they took out
the Twin Towers.</i>

492
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:25,319
<i>Trying to fucking kill us.</i>

493
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,890
<i>No. No, Sally.
To get our attention.</i>

494
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,153
<i>Attention for what?</i>

495
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:34,104
<i>Jesus Christ, Sally.
Don't you fuckin' get it?</i>

496
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:37,288
<i>Man, they don't wanna kill us over
there in the good old U.S. of A.</i>

497
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:39,168
<i>I mean, shit, they do,
but they can't.</i>

498
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:41,431
<i>It's too fuckin' hard
right now.</i>

499
00:33:41,431 --> 00:33:43,465
<i>Man, they wanna kill us here.</i>

500
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:46,879
<i>On their turf, in their
fuckin' shit hole country!</i>

501
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:50,178
<i>Yeah. Where every
turn is the wrong turn.</i>

502
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:53,362
<i>Every single one of them knew where
that fucking IED was! Goddamn right!</i>

503
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:55,318
<i>You don't see them
stepping on it? Do you? No!</i>

504
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:56,929
<i>They just sit
in their fucking backyard,</i>

505
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:59,116
<i>drinking their fucking tea,</i>

506
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:00,689
<i>waiting for one of us
poor motherfuckers</i>

507
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:02,952
<i>to light up their day.
Come on, boys.</i>

508
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:05,177
<i>Well, guess what. That ain't
gonna happen no more!</i>

509
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:09,589
<i>Hell, no! There's gonna be one big
fuckin' bitch of a preemptive strike!</i>

510
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,655
<i>Yeah! We're gonna be torching
every last Johnny-fucking-jihad!</i>

511
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:16,187
<i>Later. And there ain't
gonna be nothing left</i>

512
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,026
<i>but scorched fuckin' earth!</i>

513
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,720
Get down!

514
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,367
Go, go, go, go! Inside,
inside!

515
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:06,786
Move!
Down!

516
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:09,701
We got one! We got one!

517
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:11,121
Down! Clear!
Down!

518
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,154
Get down!

519
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,225
Get down! Get down!

520
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:16,645
Get down!
This is the guy!

521
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:19,906
Let's go! Let's go!
We're clear!

522
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:22,591
Come on, people! Let's go!
Come on!

523
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:27,041
Check the back! Check the back! Clear!

524
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,074
Move, move, move!

525
00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:31,798
What are you doing?
Oh. Oh, hi.

526
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,176
Uh, well, we're looking
for evidence right now.

527
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:36,900
Evidence of what?
Evidence of anything

528
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,971
that's gonna help us, uh,
fight the war.

529
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,736
Clear!
Can read that?

530
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,616
Well, no, of course not.
Can have this paper?

531
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:44,687
No, you can't have...
This is Iraqi, okay?

532
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:46,874
Iraqi? You mean Arabic?
Arabic. That's right.

533
00:35:46,874 --> 00:35:49,291
This is really important stuff.
So how do you know it's important?

534
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,170
Well, we're gonna find out
if it's important,

535
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,587
'cause I've got people
who can translate this for me.

536
00:35:53,587 --> 00:35:55,659
And, um...
But they're not here right now.

537
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:58,114
So you guys have to step out.
So how do you know it's evidence?

538
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,070
We're gonna find out
if it's evidence, all right?

539
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,372
Jonesy, let's get these people
out of here. Thank you for coming.

540
00:36:02,372 --> 00:36:03,791
Okay, people, let's go!
Let's go!

541
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,860
Move! Move it! Move it!
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

542
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,315
Is this the guy? Yeah,
this is him! Grab him!

543
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:12,499
Bring him out!

544
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:15,760
Get down! I won't shoot
you!

545
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:20,363
Up against the wall. Hands against
the wall. I got him, I got him.

546
00:36:20,363 --> 00:36:21,629
He's clear.

547
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:23,010
On your knees!

548
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,079
Sit down. Give me the
bag. Give me the bag.

549
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,345
I'm bagging him.

550
00:36:27,345 --> 00:36:28,803
Well, he looks
pretty harmless.

551
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:30,836
Why are using a hood?

552
00:36:30,836 --> 00:36:33,483
Why are using a hood? Because once
he's bagged, he's like a blind chicken.

553
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,245
He can't run if he can't see.
He can't breathe with that on.

554
00:36:36,245 --> 00:36:38,317
Are you sure he can breathe?
No-- Yes, he can breathe.

555
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:40,235
Can't you hear him breathing
right now?

556
00:36:40,235 --> 00:36:43,035
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure he can breathe.

557
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:46,258
She says his back is broken.

558
00:36:46,258 --> 00:36:48,674
The old man's back is broken!
Get off me!

559
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,823
She said the old man's
back is broken!

560
00:36:50,823 --> 00:36:53,163
Can you understand that?
No-- All right. Well...

561
00:36:53,163 --> 00:36:54,697
I'm not carrying
that bag of shit.

562
00:36:54,697 --> 00:36:55,925
Let's go!
Everybody out!

563
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:57,881
Let's go, let's go,
let's go! 1, 2--

564
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:03,981
Let's go!
Move, move, move!

565
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:06,090
Move, move!
Get back!

566
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:39,810
Good boy.

567
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,687
Uh, we're good.

568
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,442
Right here.

569
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:50,398
It's okay, it's okay.
Right here.

570
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:56,152
Arms up. Arms up.
That's it.

571
00:37:57,648 --> 00:37:59,989
Arms-- Arms up.
Arms up. Up. Arms.

572
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:04,592
Arms.

573
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,050
Arms!

574
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:10,768
Mmm.

575
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,778
<i>Yella.</i>

576
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:41,918
Hoo!

577
00:39:03,784 --> 00:39:05,050
<i>¶</i>

578
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,891
All the way from Camp Carolina,

579
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:08,963
<i>it's the first episode
of Drug Poker, baby.</i>

580
00:39:08,963 --> 00:39:11,264
I got an idea. Why don't you
turn off the fucking camera?

581
00:39:11,303 --> 00:39:14,333
Do you guys know how big
high-stakes poker is on TV? So what?

582
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:17,249
When I sell my show and you guys
become stars, you can all thank me then.

583
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:18,860
How about that?
Okay, yeah, we'll do that.

584
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,123
Why don't you play the
game right now? I'm playing.

585
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:22,965
You can't afford us.

586
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:25,420
There's no way.

587
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,067
Sally? Come on, shithead.
Are you in or out?

588
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:30,023
All right, all right, all right.
Don't fuck around.

589
00:39:30,023 --> 00:39:31,903
I...am...

590
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,706
Wow. I'm out.
You are so out.

591
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:35,586
Out again.
What do you know?

592
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:38,002
I was out.
Show me them. Show me them.

593
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:41,186
I got two cards. And she's doing
the Pledge of Allegiance, I think.

594
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:43,757
What you got there, Reno?

595
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:44,908
What's you say?

596
00:39:44,908 --> 00:39:46,173
"She's doing The Pledge
of Allegiance!"

597
00:39:46,173 --> 00:39:47,631
Reno's doing-- doing
all right. All right.

598
00:39:47,631 --> 00:39:49,434
Mr. Blix?
Um, she's my favorite.

599
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:51,276
I like her.
Oh, that is a solid choice.

600
00:39:51,276 --> 00:39:53,309
She looks like a nice girl.
Not bad for Mrs. Blix.

601
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:57,145
Mr. Mactastic? Um, is it wrong to
fall in love with the king of clubs?

602
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,978
If you don't ask
and you don't tell.

603
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:03,244
There you go.

604
00:40:03,244 --> 00:40:04,702
All right,
out of the cards.

605
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,582
All right.
What's happening right now?

606
00:40:06,582 --> 00:40:09,574
Blix, what do you need?
Blix needs, uh...

607
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,681
Blix needs three, although it's very
hard to say good-bye to the 8 of clubs.

608
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:15,060
Oh, yes, I'm sure it is.
No, check her out.

609
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,364
Freakie boy.

610
00:40:16,364 --> 00:40:18,781
One.

611
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:21,389
Are the cards thirsty or
something? I want four.

612
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,809
Ooh.
I'm thirsty.

613
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:24,727
What?

614
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:27,259
Did you just say you need four?
Yeah. What's the big fucking deal?

615
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,944
No, it's just--
it's perfect Rush strategy.

616
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,632
Do you even have
an ace, dude?

617
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:34,279
I have an ace,
and I boned her.

618
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:37,156
We gotta go back
to that house.

619
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:38,767
What are you talking about?
What house?

620
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,455
That house we raided last week.

621
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:42,105
I didn't see any orders
about that.

622
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:44,176
Dude, we're going to Farah's.

623
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,401
Farah's house. That's right.

624
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:48,703
What are you guys talking about?
That's not... We just...

625
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:50,659
There's nothing
in that house.

626
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:53,536
How can you say that
that tasty skank is nothing?

627
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:56,912
Come on, dude. We're gonna take
some initiative and go to that house.

628
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,406
She's a spoil of war.
That's right.

629
00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:01,976
Oh, I forgot.
That's exactly right.

630
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:04,431
Okay, you guys
are fucking crazy.

631
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:06,963
Come on. They're drunk.
Dude, we're all drunk.

632
00:41:06,963 --> 00:41:08,267
Turn that fucking thing
off.

633
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:10,185
No, keep that
fucking thing on.

634
00:41:10,185 --> 00:41:13,446
Fuck off! This is off the record,
so turn the fucking camera off!

635
00:41:13,446 --> 00:41:15,287
Back off. All right,
all right. Keep it on!

636
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:17,934
Fuck off!
Guys, relax.

637
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,313
Let's just play the game. You guys are
really drunk, as I was saying before.

638
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:22,231
So I actually think maybe... I'm
seeing things clearer than you.

639
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:24,609
No, you're not seeing
anything clearer, Flake.

640
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:26,566
Flake, you haven't seen anything
clear in, like, four months.

641
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:28,023
Stop it!
Who doesn't see clear?

642
00:41:28,023 --> 00:41:30,901
How the fuck am I
supposed to see clearly?

643
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:34,392
I mean,
what are we doing here?

644
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,655
"What are we doing here?" Yeah,
what the fuck are we doing here?

645
00:41:36,655 --> 00:41:38,036
You know
what we're doing here.

646
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:39,455
We're helping the new
Iraqi government survive.

647
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,875
Knuckleheads.

648
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,179
And what the fuck
do you think

649
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:43,406
is so important about that?

650
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:45,248
I think there's a lot
important about that.

651
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:47,166
Enlighten me.
We're, you know-- We're--

652
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,892
What?
We're just doing our job.

653
00:41:48,892 --> 00:41:50,964
We're not-- We're not
supposed to think about it.

654
00:41:50,964 --> 00:41:52,613
We're supposed to follow
orders. We're soldiers. Amen.

655
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:54,877
Yeah.
Welcome to the fucking Army.

656
00:41:54,877 --> 00:41:56,718
But these people
don't want us here.

657
00:41:56,718 --> 00:41:59,135
Yes, they do. No, they don't.
They want us dead and gone.

658
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:02,050
And when those fucking beltway clerks
finally find that out, we're gonna be both.

659
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,927
So, in the meantime,
Rush and me

660
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,306
and...Gabriel... I have
to say shut the fuck up.

661
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:09,914
Get away from me,
because I'm not doing...

662
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:14,057
You're such a pussy! I'm not a pussy because
I don't wanna break through the door...

663
00:42:14,057 --> 00:42:15,669
Oh, no, the door's
already broken down.

664
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,855
The door's already broken down.
The father's locked up.

665
00:42:17,894 --> 00:42:19,927
What's the problem? Nothing
to worry about. Let's do it.

666
00:42:19,927 --> 00:42:22,497
Sounds like the perfect
cap on the evening. I agree.

667
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:24,837
Yeah, perfect cap on the evening.
I'm gonna go wake up Sarge.

668
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:27,868
I'm gonna ask him what the SOP is on
a gang rape. You're not gonna say shit!

669
00:42:27,868 --> 00:42:29,671
Don't wake up Sarge for this.
I'm not gonna say shit?

670
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:34,696
No, you're not gonna say shit. You
know why Sarge is finding out shit?

671
00:42:34,696 --> 00:42:36,461
Why?
Because nothing's gonna happen,

672
00:42:36,461 --> 00:42:39,491
because you guys couldn't even get
outside the wire if you wanted to.

673
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:42,790
Get your fucking hands off me!
Hey! Hey! Cut it out. Cut it out.

674
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,437
That's bullshit!
Sit down, sit down.

675
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:48,928
If you can find your chair.
Got it.

676
00:42:48,928 --> 00:42:51,613
All right. Can we
play the fucking game?

677
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:54,644
Jesus Christ, Gabe!
What do you think, Sally?

678
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:58,403
I-- I think I'm gonna be going for
this little-- this little jaunt.

679
00:42:58,403 --> 00:43:00,321
Yeah, you are, baby!

680
00:43:02,508 --> 00:43:04,234
Sally's got a set of balls.

681
00:43:04,234 --> 00:43:06,766
What about you, McCoy?
Are you serious?

682
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:08,377
Come on, dude. Come with.
Get your fucking hand off me.

683
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,449
No, fuck him.
Pussy boy doesn't want to go.

684
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:12,137
Dude, let me
tell you something.

685
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:13,825
First of all, y'all
are drunk. Thank you.

686
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,625
Probably high doing all
sorts of fucking drugs

687
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:18,467
or whatever the hell
you're doing.

688
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:21,996
You're fucked-up.
But?

689
00:43:21,996 --> 00:43:25,525
If I go, it's to make sure you don't get
your asses killed. That's right. When we go.

690
00:43:25,525 --> 00:43:27,290
We are not
gonna get killed!

691
00:43:29,706 --> 00:43:31,778
<i>"Hello, honey.</i>

692
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:36,036
<i>"I don't have much time,
but I have to send you this.</i>

693
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:40,486
<i>"First, I want you to know
that I love you very much.</i>

694
00:43:40,486 --> 00:43:42,366
<i>"I miss you more every day</i>

695
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:44,744
<i>"and can't wait to touch
your beautiful face.</i>

696
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,616
<i>"I was looking
at the pictures</i>

697
00:43:49,616 --> 00:43:52,071
<i>"you just sent me
of you and the boys.</i>

698
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:55,255
<i>"I'm wishing to God
I was there instead of here.</i>

699
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:59,475
<i>"The guys have been
drinking all day,</i>

700
00:43:59,475 --> 00:44:02,774
<i>"and it looks like they're
going out looking for trouble.</i>

701
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:03,925
<i>"I can't stop them,</i>

702
00:44:03,925 --> 00:44:05,344
<i>"but I'm going to make sure</i>

703
00:44:05,344 --> 00:44:08,145
<i>"they don't
get themselves hurt.</i>

704
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,216
<i>"You just can't go outside
and blow off steam here.</i>

705
00:44:10,216 --> 00:44:12,365
<i>"It's too dangerous.</i>

706
00:44:12,365 --> 00:44:16,239
<i>"Anyway, I love you.</i>

707
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,390
<i>Lawyer."</i>

708
00:44:24,218 --> 00:44:26,136
<i>I knew he was doing
raids outside the wire,</i>

709
00:44:26,136 --> 00:44:29,435
<i>but he hadn't done
too many in a while,</i>

710
00:44:29,435 --> 00:44:32,351
<i>and I-I'd built up
a sense of security</i>

711
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:33,195
<i>in knowing this.</i>

712
00:44:36,878 --> 00:44:40,867
<i>I live for his phone calls
and his chats online, you know?</i>

713
00:44:42,172 --> 00:44:43,744
<i>They help me not
to worry so much.</i>

714
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,997
<i>But today is--</i>

715
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:53,833
<i>...is different.</i>

716
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,882
<i>Oh, my--</i>

717
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,521
<i>Um, I'm scared. I'm--</i>

718
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:13,053
<i>I'm scared to death for him.</i>

719
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:20,610
I rigged a mini-cam
to my helmet

720
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,991
so I can record
tonight's follies

721
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:23,679
without the guys
knowing about it.

722
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,290
I don't want 'em
getting camera-shy.

723
00:45:32,425 --> 00:45:33,921
<i>So what are you
gonna do?</i>

724
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:35,417
<i>I don't know, man.
I'm gonna--</i>

725
00:45:35,417 --> 00:45:37,412
<i>...go with them and try to
talk some sense into them.</i>

726
00:45:37,412 --> 00:45:39,330
<i>Dude, they're going to get
about 20 feet outside there,</i>

727
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,711
<i>they'll get scared
of the dark,</i>

728
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:42,668
<i>and come right back here.
And what about Sally?</i>

729
00:45:42,668 --> 00:45:45,391
<i>Sa-- Man, you know,
Sally-- What's he doing?</i>

730
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:48,882
<i>He's gonna go out there, come
running back to base camp,</i>

731
00:45:48,882 --> 00:45:51,759
<i>turn on his camcorder and give a
firsthand account of what he saw.</i>

732
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:54,560
<i>It's sick.
It's fuckin' sick.</i>

733
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,286
<i>It's a pretty juicy
story, though, isn't it?</i>

734
00:45:58,396 --> 00:46:01,005
<i>"Our band of brothers
losing their moral compass</i>

735
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:04,611
<i>and trying to wreak vengeance
on a 15-year-old girl.</i>

736
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:06,529
<i>It's unbelievable.
Yeah.</i>

737
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:09,137
<i>Ride the cable news chain all
the way up to 60 fucking Minutes.</i>

738
00:46:09,137 --> 00:46:10,710
<i>Hey.
Hey, Rush. What's up, man?</i>

739
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:13,702
<i>What the fuck
are you two doing?</i>

740
00:46:13,702 --> 00:46:16,157
<i>Just talking, you know.
Smoking.</i>

741
00:46:16,157 --> 00:46:19,035
<i>Oh. Thought you quit.</i>

742
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:22,717
<i>Uh, no. No, I--
I never quit.</i>

743
00:46:23,983 --> 00:46:25,594
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

744
00:46:25,594 --> 00:46:27,052
<i>Temper, temper!</i>

745
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:30,313
<i>Hot damn. The fuckin'
pussy's on the rag again.</i>

746
00:46:30,313 --> 00:46:32,461
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

747
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:34,916
<i>Hey, man. Where's your gear?
Rush, dude. Come on.</i>

748
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:36,758
<i>Let's think about this.
I mean seriously.</i>

749
00:46:36,758 --> 00:46:38,254
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

750
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:39,788
<i>Fuck that, dude. Fuck that.</i>

751
00:46:39,788 --> 00:46:42,780
<i>Shut up, man.
I'm all thunk out, okay?</i>

752
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,156
<i>My fuck stick needs some
pussy. Like right now.</i>

753
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:48,650
<i>Okay? Whackin' off in a sock just
ain't cuttin' it no more, man.</i>

754
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:52,141
<i>This fucking baby
is hurtin'!</i>

755
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:56,744
<i>It's like all red, and sore,
and chapped and shit, man.</i>

756
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:59,928
<i>And there is nothing like
some sweet hajji ass</i>

00:46:59,928 --> 00:47:02,115
<i>that is going to get this
plumbing right back into alignment.</i>

758
00:47:02,115 --> 00:47:04,416
<i>You can't be fucking serious.
I am dead serious, dude.</i>

759
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:07,485
<i>So get your fuckin'
gear on, and let's go!</i>

760
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:09,979
<i>Go on! Get your fuckin'
shit on! McCord--</i>

761
00:47:09,979 --> 00:47:11,743
<i>McCord, this is fuckin'--
And you! You, you!</i>

762
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:13,662
<i>Get your fuckin' hands
off me! Shut the fuck up!</i>

763
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:15,311
<i>Shut up! Just shut up!</i>

764
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:18,495
<i>You listen to me like you never
listened before in your life.</i>

765
00:47:18,495 --> 00:47:20,106
<i>If I hear you breathing
one word</i>

766
00:47:20,106 --> 00:47:21,679
<i>about anything
that goes on here tonight,</i>

767
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,132
<i>so help me God, I will cut
your fucking tongue out.</i>

768
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:27,625
<i>And I'll feed it to
that fucking dog of yours.</i>

769
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,543
<i>You get me?</i>

770
00:47:29,543 --> 00:47:31,461
<i>Do you get me, Blix?</i>

771
00:47:31,461 --> 00:47:35,029
<i>Yeah.
Good boy.</i>

772
00:47:35,029 --> 00:47:37,139
<i>Now why don't you get
the fuck out of here?</i>

773
00:47:37,177 --> 00:47:38,673
<i>Go read some Shakespeare.</i>

774
00:47:48,264 --> 00:47:50,028
I'm talking about the
girl, man. The girl?

775
00:47:50,028 --> 00:47:51,755
I'm talking about fucking
with a 15-year-old girl.

776
00:47:51,755 --> 00:47:53,788
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're all discombobulated.

777
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,013
<i>You got to lay off
that hajji juice,</i>

778
00:47:56,013 --> 00:47:57,432
'cause that is
some sneaky shit.

779
00:47:57,432 --> 00:47:58,736
I don't touch that fucking
shit, you know that.

780
00:47:58,736 --> 00:48:00,232
Really? What the fuck
are you doing up here?

781
00:48:00,232 --> 00:48:01,767
You're supposed to be
at the rear. Excuse me?

782
00:48:01,767 --> 00:48:03,110
You giving me
an order, Private Flake?

783
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,951
That's right, Corporal.
Get to the fuckin' rear!

784
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:08,442
Fuck off me!

785
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:10,322
Fuck you!
Fuck off, bitch.

786
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:12,125
McCoy! McCoy,
you're not going to go in?

787
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:13,812
Fuck it!
McCoy, come on!

788
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:15,731
What's your excuse, Sally? Huh?
Excuse for what?

789
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:17,418
Excuse for wanting
to take a part of this, huh?

790
00:48:17,418 --> 00:48:20,027
McCoy, I'm a fly on the wall. I got
to get a record of what's happening.

791
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:22,405
That's right, you're the
fly on the fuckin' wall. Yes!

792
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:25,091
Actually, Sally, I think
you're a fuckin' jackal!

793
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:26,932
Ripping meat off
a fucking carcass!

794
00:48:26,932 --> 00:48:28,927
That's what you are.
Can I quote you on that one?

795
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,500
Sure, Sally, quote away.

796
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,917
You know what? I got another quote
for you. You ready? What? What?

797
00:48:32,917 --> 00:48:36,446
Take a look around you at all your
greedy, media buddies-- You dick.

798
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,400
...who sold their soul for
a talk show and a book deal!

799
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,932
'Cause that's what you are! This is my
free pass into film school, right now.

800
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,581
Really? Well done, Sally.

801
00:48:43,581 --> 00:48:45,576
Take it all down,
cry for cry,

802
00:48:45,576 --> 00:48:46,765
and scream for scream--
go ahead!

803
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:48,415
Thanks for your permission,
there, dick.

804
00:48:48,415 --> 00:48:49,681
Oh, look out there, Mac.

805
00:48:49,681 --> 00:48:51,637
I don't want you tripping
over your goddamn soapbox.

806
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:54,437
Fuck it.

807
00:48:54,437 --> 00:48:56,509
Fuck you!

808
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:01,496
Flake! Flake.

809
00:49:01,496 --> 00:49:03,951
Flake,
enough's enough, man.

810
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:05,524
Enough's enough.
You've had your fun.

811
00:49:05,524 --> 00:49:08,785
Let's get out of here.
We're just gettin' started.

812
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:11,700
We just got here. What
the fuck's your problem, McCoy?

813
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,618
You shouldn't be here,
Flake, and you know it.

814
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:16,841
We're just here, man.
We're here,

815
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:19,756
and we are gonna fuckin'
find these--

816
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,748
weapons-- we're searching
for evidence--

817
00:49:22,748 --> 00:49:25,894
We're looking for weapons
of mass destruction!

818
00:49:25,894 --> 00:49:27,582
Weapons of mass destruction.
That's right.

819
00:49:27,582 --> 00:49:29,001
I don't give a shit
what anybody says.

820
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:30,382
They're here, and
we're going to find them.

821
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:32,339
Flake, there is nothing
here, and you know it!

822
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,333
What are you fucking-- We ripped
this place apart last week.

823
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,558
There's nothing here!
They're just like weeds, McCoy.

824
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:39,359
You rip 'em up, they're all
back the next day, aren't they?

825
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,083
She's a 15-year-old girl, man.
She's a 15-year-old girl.

826
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,039
We're going to accomplish this
mission. Please don't do this.

827
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:46,686
We are going to conquer that.
It's inhuman to rape.

828
00:49:46,686 --> 00:49:51,098
She's a fine cunt, just like
everybody else in this fucking country.

829
00:49:51,098 --> 00:49:54,282
I'm not doin' it, man.
You fuckin' candy ass!

830
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,238
Well, you're not doin' it!
Shut the fuck up.

831
00:49:56,238 --> 00:49:58,156
Are you not
supporting the troops?

832
00:49:58,156 --> 00:49:59,921
What? Are you not supporting the troops?

833
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:01,992
No.

834
00:50:01,992 --> 00:50:04,562
Oops. Did I just blow
your fuckin' head off?

835
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:07,363
Don't.
Where are your balls, McCoy?

836
00:50:07,363 --> 00:50:09,434
Man, I thought you had a
pair. What are they, at home?

837
00:50:09,434 --> 00:50:11,851
<i>Inside your wife's
sandy hajj pussy?</i>

838
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:13,155
God!

839
00:50:13,155 --> 00:50:14,958
Fuck you!

840
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:17,490
Thought you had a pair.

841
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,447
How about you, Rush?
Where are your balls?

842
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:21,020
They're almost
in her ass, sir.

843
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,705
Almost in her ass.
What about you, Sally?

844
00:50:23,705 --> 00:50:26,237
Get it up!
"I can't hear you, sir."

845
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:28,116
They're right here. I can't
hear you. I can't hear you!

846
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:29,306
They're right here!
Where are your balls?

847
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:30,955
They're right here!
Good!

848
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,369
All right.

849
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:36,287
All right, motherfucker.
Hitch a ride outside.

850
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:38,704
Take the faggot watch. Yeah,
take the faggot watch, you pussy!

851
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:42,080
Bunch of fuckin' assholes.
Fuck you.

852
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,576
What do you think
of that, huh?

853
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:44,880
Ooh, did you like that?

854
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,182
Did you miss me, huh?

855
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:52,821
Oh, it's go time for you.
You ready?

856
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:55,161
Huh?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

857
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:57,923
So, you ready?
Here you go, here you go.

858
00:50:57,923 --> 00:51:00,992
Come here, Salazar. Come
here. Take her fucking hand.

859
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:02,412
Take her fucking hand!
Rush. Rush.

860
00:51:02,412 --> 00:51:03,869
Rush, hold on!

861
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:05,596
Wait. Wait for Flake. Hold
on, Rush. Wait for Flake.

862
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:08,626
This is his idea. He gets
the cherry. Come on, wait up.

863
00:51:08,626 --> 00:51:11,580
What? You got a problem
with sloppy seconds?

864
00:51:15,646 --> 00:51:18,984
Holy shit!

865
00:51:18,984 --> 00:51:20,749
He tried to use
this on me.

866
00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:22,398
Motherfuck.

867
00:51:22,398 --> 00:51:24,355
Those motherfuckers! What
the fuck do you think I did?

868
00:51:24,355 --> 00:51:27,385
I fuckin' killed them all.
I killed them all.

869
00:51:27,423 --> 00:51:29,380
Every fuckin' one of them.

870
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,183
They're fuckin'
all gone, baby.

871
00:51:31,183 --> 00:51:33,907
They're all fuckin' gone.

872
00:51:33,907 --> 00:51:36,515
All right.
Sally, come on over here, baby.

873
00:51:36,515 --> 00:51:38,817
It's showtime. Take the
fuckin' hand. Here we go.

874
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:44,648
Oh. You ready? You ready for
the ride of your life, bitch?

875
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:50,095
Shut the fuck up! Don't
you fuckin' make a sound!

876
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:52,090
Give it to her!

877
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:55,312
Aah!

878
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:03,675
God!
What happened?

879
00:52:03,675 --> 00:52:06,015
What happened in there?
Talk to me!

880
00:52:08,164 --> 00:52:10,926
<i>Tell them-- No! Fuck!
What are you talking about?</i>

881
00:52:10,926 --> 00:52:13,956
<i>McCoy!</i>

882
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,567
<i>What's up, Rush?</i>

883
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:17,524
<i>What are you doing?
What am I doing?</i>

884
00:52:17,524 --> 00:52:18,598
<i>What are you telling Blix? Nothing.</i>

885
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:21,245
<i>Just shooting
the breeze, man.</i>

886
00:52:21,245 --> 00:52:22,281
<i>Just shooting
the breeze, huh?</i>

887
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:23,777
<i>Get the fuck off him, Rush.
Back off!</i>

888
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:26,155
<i>Back off, Blix!
I'll cut you like a pig!</i>

889
00:52:26,155 --> 00:52:27,843
<i>Sit down.
Okay, okay.</i>

890
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:30,260
<i>Get the fuck off me! If you
fuckin' move, I'll snap it.</i>

891
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,216
<i>It'll be real quick.
Piece of shit.</i>

892
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:34,441
<i>I want you to listen
to me real careful, Mac.</i>

893
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:36,858
<i>Listen to what?</i>

894
00:52:36,858 --> 00:52:39,620
<i>Have you ever
been to Vegas?</i>

895
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,420
<i>What?
Are you fucking deaf, McCoy?</i>

896
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,032
<i>Am I speaking too softly
for you? No, I hear you.</i>

897
00:52:44,032 --> 00:52:46,065
<i>All right. So you're tuned
in on my frequency, right?</i>

898
00:52:46,065 --> 00:52:47,523
<i>Yes. Good. Now let me ask you again.</i>

899
00:52:47,523 --> 00:52:49,824
<i>Have you ever
been to Vegas?</i>

900
00:52:49,824 --> 00:52:50,898
<i>Yes, I've been
to fucking Vegas.</i>

901
00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:54,197
<i>Good. Now what
do they say?</i>

902
00:52:54,197 --> 00:52:57,688
<i>Uh-- What do they say
about what happens there?</i>

903
00:52:57,688 --> 00:52:59,530
<i>It stays there.
I'm sorry. What was that?</i>

904
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,141
<i>It stays there.</i>

905
00:53:01,141 --> 00:53:02,790
<i>"What happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas."</i>

906
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,092
<i>That's right.
That's right, Big Mac.</i>

907
00:53:05,092 --> 00:53:07,547
<i>Now I want you to think
about our little trip tonight,</i>

908
00:53:07,547 --> 00:53:09,849
<i>like it was a trip to Vegas. Okay.</i>

909
00:53:09,849 --> 00:53:11,115
<i>You read me, soldier?
Yes, I read you.</i>

910
00:53:11,115 --> 00:53:12,458
<i>Do you fuckin' read me?
Yes, I hear you!</i>

911
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:26,613
<i>Sometimes, man--</i>

912
00:53:26,613 --> 00:53:29,452
<i>I swear to God.</i>

913
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,907
<i>For a college boy, you can
be real fucking stupid.</i>

914
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:34,093
<i>Where's Flake, Rush?</i>

915
00:53:36,817 --> 00:53:38,889
<i>What the fuck
do you care, hairball?</i>

916
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:40,500
<i>Huh?</i>

917
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,454
<i>For your information, our boy
Flake is inside right now.</i>

918
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:47,175
<i>Sleeping like
a little baby.</i>

919
00:53:47,175 --> 00:53:50,167
<i>You know what
that's like, right, Blix?</i>

920
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:51,356
<i>Right after you've been
sucked and fucked?</i>

921
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,527
<i>Hey, Mac, man.
Where were you?</i>

922
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,832
<i>What do you mean,
where was I?</i>

923
00:54:00,832 --> 00:54:02,558
<i>I mean, what the fuck
happened to you?</i>

924
00:54:02,558 --> 00:54:04,438
<i>I went outside.
I was on watch.</i>

925
00:54:04,438 --> 00:54:06,471
<i>Flake stuck a gun
in my face. You remember that?</i>

926
00:54:06,471 --> 00:54:09,425
<i>That's right, that's right.
You were on watch.</i>

927
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:11,036
<i>Did you see anything?</i>

928
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:17,365
<i>Ah. No, I didn't
see anything.</i>

929
00:54:17,365 --> 00:54:20,242
<i>Well, that's good. That's good,
because you were on watch, right?</i>

930
00:54:20,242 --> 00:54:21,547
<i>Yeah, I was on watch, so--</i>

931
00:54:21,547 --> 00:54:22,928
<i>I mean, it was kind of
dark out there, too.</i>

932
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:24,347
<i>Yeah, it was
pitch dark, actually.</i>

933
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:27,032
<i>Yeah.</i>

934
00:54:27,032 --> 00:54:28,337
<i>What about the fire?
Did you see the fire?</i>

935
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:32,979
<i>Fire?
It was a big fuckin' fire.</i>

936
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:35,549
<i>You didn't see that?
No, I didn't see it.</i>

937
00:54:35,549 --> 00:54:37,275
<i>I had my back
to the house,</i>

938
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:39,577
<i>just looking around,
so I guess I must have</i>

939
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:40,728
<i>missed the fire.</i>

940
00:54:40,728 --> 00:54:42,722
<i>That's good.
That's good, man.</i>

941
00:54:42,722 --> 00:54:44,180
<i>And what about
the insurgents?</i>

942
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:48,668
<i>Insurgents?
Yeah, man.</i>

943
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:50,548
<i>We had to hightail it
out of there.</i>

944
00:54:50,548 --> 00:54:52,121
<i>They were
like, all over the place.</i>

945
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:54,077
<i>And really pissed.</i>

946
00:54:54,077 --> 00:54:56,916
<i>Mm.</i>

947
00:54:56,916 --> 00:55:00,599
<i>That must have been one of
those Sunni-Shiite things.</i>

948
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:03,284
<i>Right.
You know, I mean--</i>

949
00:55:03,284 --> 00:55:06,392
<i>We don't want to get caught
in a civil war crossfire.</i>

950
00:55:06,392 --> 00:55:11,992
<i>So the, uh, insurgents
set the fire.</i>

951
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:13,949
<i>Yeah, it must have been.</i>

952
00:55:16,787 --> 00:55:20,240
<i>Because you know,</i>

953
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,005
<i>when they're not trying
to kill us,</i>

954
00:55:23,693 --> 00:55:25,304
<i>Yeah, they're torchi''
each other.</i>

955
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,080
And when did you start
having these dreams?

956
00:57:07,384 --> 00:57:11,911
A couple nights.
I couldn't sleep.

957
00:57:11,911 --> 00:57:13,752
I don't want to sleep.

958
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:19,430
Can you remember anything?
Anything that happened

959
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,923
that could have
triggered them?

960
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:26,987
Yeah, after Sweet died?

961
00:57:26,987 --> 00:57:29,557
And I was shooting it
when it happened.

962
00:57:29,557 --> 00:57:32,588
He got blown apart.
I got it all on tape.

963
00:57:32,588 --> 00:57:34,889
His arm landed
right in front of me.

964
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:39,684
Have you looked
at the video?

965
00:57:39,684 --> 00:57:42,600
Couple of times,
but then I stop,

966
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,940
but it kept going, going over
and over again in my head.

967
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:49,236
That's when I began
hating everyone.

968
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:50,924
<i>Every hajji out there.</i>

969
00:57:50,924 --> 00:57:53,264
I couldn't stand the sight of
them, and I got angry all the time.

970
00:57:53,264 --> 00:57:54,914
And then I couldn't sleep,
and every time I did,

971
00:57:54,914 --> 00:57:56,986
I'd have the same dream
of her body burning.

972
00:57:56,986 --> 00:57:58,673
Her body?

973
00:57:58,673 --> 00:58:01,014
No. No.
No, his body.

974
00:58:01,014 --> 00:58:03,737
Sweet's body.

975
00:58:03,737 --> 00:58:05,310
It gets mixed up
in my head.

976
00:58:08,149 --> 00:58:10,566
And you videoed it.

977
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:15,284
Yeah. It's part of my diary
of my experiences here.

978
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:18,046
I'm going to use it
to get into film school.

979
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:22,841
Is this part
of your experience?

980
00:58:23,992 --> 00:58:26,524
What, talking to you?
Yeah.

981
00:58:26,524 --> 00:58:27,713
Talking to me.

982
00:58:31,626 --> 00:58:33,928
I can't do it anymore.

983
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:38,378
Everything
you shouldn't see,

984
00:58:38,378 --> 00:58:41,677
just because you're watching it
doesn't mean you're not a part of it.

985
00:58:41,677 --> 00:58:43,710
That's what everyone does, you know?
They just watch, and they do nothing.

986
00:58:48,812 --> 00:58:50,960
Or they make a
video for people to watch,

987
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,303
and they do nothing!

988
00:59:04,425 --> 00:59:07,341
Got to tell someone.

989
00:59:07,341 --> 00:59:09,105
It's driving me crazy.

990
00:59:12,942 --> 00:59:16,394
Dad, if something happened,

991
00:59:16,394 --> 00:59:20,230
something really,
really horrible,

992
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:23,453
and you knew who
was responsible,

993
00:59:23,453 --> 00:59:25,831
isn't it your duty
to say something?

994
00:59:25,831 --> 00:59:28,746
What did you do?

995
00:59:28,746 --> 00:59:31,624
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do a damn thing.

996
00:59:31,624 --> 00:59:33,043
A couple of my buddies--

997
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:35,843
Members of your squad?
Yes, sir.

998
00:59:35,843 --> 00:59:38,490
I hope you realize how serious
this situation could be.

999
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,102
Yes, I do realize.

1000
00:59:40,102 --> 00:59:41,559
We don't need another
Abu Ghraib.

1001
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:43,017
I understand that,
sir, but--

1002
00:59:43,017 --> 00:59:44,858
I mean, if your brothers
screwed up,

1003
00:59:44,858 --> 00:59:46,470
that behavior reflects
on the whole Corps.

1004
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:49,884
There was a crime, sir. I
think charges should be brought.

1005
00:59:51,073 --> 00:59:52,914
Son, listen to me.

1006
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:54,334
Do you know the first thing
to come into question

1007
00:59:54,334 --> 00:59:55,791
in a court martial
in a thing like this

1008
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:57,786
will be your sanity.
My sanity?

1009
00:59:57,786 --> 01:00:00,433
That's right! Your sanity,
for bringing charges like this.

1010
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:04,768
I don't care.

1011
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:09,065
I don't care.

1012
01:00:11,098 --> 01:00:13,860
Here I am, Mama, in
beautiful, downtown Samarra,

1013
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,737
getting you
a homecoming present.

1014
01:00:16,737 --> 01:00:19,652
I've been shooting
some unbelievable stuff.

1015
01:00:19,652 --> 01:00:23,373
I can't show it to anybody, because
I'd get in a lot of trouble here.

1016
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:26,212
But when I get back,
everyone's going to see this.

1017
01:00:26,212 --> 01:00:28,207
The truth about
what's going down here.

1018
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,739
24 times a second,
24/7--

1019
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:33,041
Get off! Rush! Rush!

1020
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:57,170
Fuck. Sally, where
the fuck did you go?

1021
01:01:23,793 --> 01:01:25,404
Mount up!

1022
01:01:25,404 --> 01:01:27,783
The body being
loaded into this military ambulance

1023
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:31,043
is believed to be that of the U.S.
soldier missing since last Friday.

1024
01:01:31,043 --> 01:01:34,534
That's according to Iraq Defense
Ministry Secretary, Abdul Aziz.

1025
01:01:34,534 --> 01:01:36,798
This Bedouin encampment
where the body was discovered

1026
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:39,598
just moments ago is outside
the Samarra base camp

1027
01:01:39,598 --> 01:01:41,247
where the soldier
was kidnapped.

1028
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,242
The Pentagon has not yet
issued a statement

1029
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:45,621
on the identity of the body,

1030
01:01:45,621 --> 01:01:48,383
but senior sources tell us it
could be the body of Angel Salazar,

1031
01:01:48,383 --> 01:01:50,915
who went missing last Friday.

1032
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,600
Iraqi Defense Ministry
spokesmen have said

1033
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,825
the details are
very disturbing.

1034
01:01:55,825 --> 01:01:57,436
There are signs of
torture and decapitation.

1035
01:02:45,273 --> 01:02:48,419
<i>Allahu Akbhar! Allahu
Akbhar! Allahu Akbhar!</i>

1036
01:03:07,753 --> 01:03:11,627
Private Flake,

1037
01:03:11,627 --> 01:03:14,274
what kind of a soldier

1038
01:03:14,274 --> 01:03:17,727
was your fallen friend,

1039
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,760
Angel Salazar?

1040
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,982
<i>And take your time.</i>

1041
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,131
What the fuck?

1042
01:03:25,131 --> 01:03:26,703
What do you think I was
doing? I was taking my time.

1043
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:28,430
Jesus Christ, Snowflake.

1044
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,811
Don't get a fuckin'
hard-on, man, all right?

1045
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:32,266
I'm trying to make this
official and everything.

1046
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:35,143
All right?
All right.

1047
01:03:35,143 --> 01:03:38,327
Uh, Private,
how-how would you

1048
01:03:38,327 --> 01:03:43,084
summarize
your buddy?

1049
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:46,114
I mean, you know,
if you take all of

1050
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:47,649
his...his parts,

1051
01:03:47,649 --> 01:03:50,488
and you like stack them,
one on top of one another,

1052
01:03:51,754 --> 01:03:53,403
right, what would--
What would--

1053
01:03:53,403 --> 01:03:55,360
<i>What would be the one
word that would--</i>

1054
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,505
...be the sum of those parts? Generous?

1055
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:01,191
Generous.
He was a generous spic.

1056
01:04:01,191 --> 01:04:03,876
That's a very good word.

1057
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:08,633
And how
was he generous?

1058
01:04:08,633 --> 01:04:13,044
He was a...
dedicated reporter.

1059
01:04:13,044 --> 01:04:16,037
He used that camera.
This camera right here?

1060
01:04:16,037 --> 01:04:20,793
To record his-- our--
war stories.

1061
01:04:20,793 --> 01:04:24,630
Stories that will
last on into history.

1062
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:26,509
Long after
you and me are gone.

1063
01:04:29,962 --> 01:04:35,141
He was like our
very own Private...Ryan.

1064
01:04:36,215 --> 01:04:38,248
Hey-up!

1065
01:04:38,248 --> 01:04:40,089
Semper fi, brother.

1066
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:42,851
Semper fuckin' fi,
fuck Marines.

1067
01:04:42,851 --> 01:04:44,347
Okay.

1068
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:47,340
What would be, Private,

1069
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,680
your last memory

1070
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,171
of our brother Salazar?

1071
01:04:53,171 --> 01:04:56,393
I--

1072
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,580
...just can't
talk about it.

1073
01:05:01,725 --> 01:05:05,216
I understand.
This is hard.

1074
01:05:05,216 --> 01:05:08,400
But I can talk
about my brother.

1075
01:05:10,126 --> 01:05:11,814
And the life lessons
that he taught me.

1076
01:05:11,814 --> 01:05:14,461
<i>Well, lay it on me.</i>

1077
01:05:15,919 --> 01:05:18,106
My brother, Vegas Flake.

1078
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,325
Really, you have a
brother named Vegas? Yep.

1079
01:05:22,325 --> 01:05:24,052
I have a brother named
Vegas. Reno and Vegas.

1080
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:29,077
Daddy was a gambler,

1081
01:05:29,077 --> 01:05:30,305
and he named his
two favorite sons

1082
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:32,836
after his two
favorite places.

1083
01:05:32,836 --> 01:05:34,985
Hmm.
Called us his wild cards.

1084
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:39,665
That's nice.
Yeah, I thought so.

1085
01:05:39,665 --> 01:05:42,887
I do, too.
Vegas was a Teamster.

1086
01:05:42,887 --> 01:05:45,189
Mm-hmm.
And the head of his local,

1087
01:05:45,189 --> 01:05:47,491
Mike Dancer,
he's a troublemaker.

1088
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:51,097
He'd run for president
of the U.T.,

1089
01:05:51,097 --> 01:05:55,662
and lost, now the bitter prick
Dancer's contesting the election.

1090
01:05:55,662 --> 01:05:56,774
Got ahold of some
ballot boxes

1091
01:05:56,774 --> 01:06:00,687
that my brother Vegas
had rigged,

1092
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:03,065
and he's blowing his whistle
to federal prosecutors.

1093
01:06:03,065 --> 01:06:06,786
Nothing but a fucking rat.
Word comes down.

1094
01:06:06,786 --> 01:06:08,935
He's got to go.

1095
01:06:08,935 --> 01:06:11,658
So, what happened?

1096
01:06:11,658 --> 01:06:14,727
A fucking embarrassment.

1097
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:17,144
A bunch of clowns who need a road
map to find their own assholes

1098
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:19,983
drive out to his house
one night.

1099
01:06:19,983 --> 01:06:24,241
Knock on the door.

1100
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:27,425
And are they, like,
locked and loaded?

1101
01:06:27,425 --> 01:06:29,918
Yeah! Yeah, they are
locked and loaded.

1102
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:31,913
So? So.

1103
01:06:31,913 --> 01:06:33,448
Dancer opens the door.

1104
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,941
He's there, big as life
in his shorts and T-shirt,

1105
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:37,552
holding his fucking
newspaper?

1106
01:06:39,624 --> 01:06:41,389
And what do you think
our Wild Bunch did?

1107
01:06:41,389 --> 01:06:43,997
They just blasted
the shit out of him, right?

1108
01:06:43,997 --> 01:06:46,644
Wrong. They asked him
for a job.

1109
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:50,480
A job.
Yeah, that's right.

1110
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,283
A job. They're too
chickenshit to shoot him.

1111
01:06:52,283 --> 01:06:55,160
He's the head of a local.

1112
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,922
Since they're not getting paid
for not killing him--

1113
01:06:57,922 --> 01:07:00,569
and what the fuck are they
doing on his doorstep anyway--

1114
01:07:00,569 --> 01:07:03,485
they ask him for a job.

1115
01:07:03,485 --> 01:07:05,096
They really asked him
for a job?

1116
01:07:05,096 --> 01:07:06,899
Yeah, he says to 'em, too.
He's like,

1117
01:07:06,899 --> 01:07:09,431
"Come by the office in the morning.
I'll see what I can do for you."

1118
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:11,733
They get in the car,
drive to the nearest bar.

1119
01:07:11,733 --> 01:07:13,267
Fucking embarrassment.

1120
01:07:15,147 --> 01:07:16,950
Right, I don't get it.

1121
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:19,443
Listen on, my man.

1122
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,507
Clyde, the mastermind
of this group,

1123
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,579
sees my brother--

1124
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:28,458
Vegas.

1125
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,108
...playing pool.

1126
01:07:30,108 --> 01:07:33,177
Invites him in the back room,
says Dancer's going down.

1127
01:07:33,177 --> 01:07:36,016
Vegas has got his own
beef with Dancer, right?

1128
01:07:36,016 --> 01:07:38,509
Contract for 20,000? My brother
says he'll do it for ten.

1129
01:07:39,967 --> 01:07:42,307
What about the other
guys, says Clyde.

1130
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,642
What about the other guys,
says my brother.

1131
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:51,283
I-I-- I still
don't get it, though.

1132
01:07:51,283 --> 01:07:52,396
They drive back out
to Dancer's.

1133
01:07:55,964 --> 01:07:57,767
Opens the door.
Oh, shit.

1134
01:07:57,767 --> 01:07:59,838
Shorts, T-shirt.

1135
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:01,526
Vegas shoots him in the face.

1136
01:08:03,482 --> 01:08:05,247
Steps over the body,

1137
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,930
goes upstairs,
kills the wife and kids,

1138
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:13,265
in and out, five minutes.

1139
01:08:13,265 --> 01:08:14,991
End of story.

1140
01:08:17,216 --> 01:08:20,707
Wow. Um--

1141
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:24,083
All right. So, uh,

1142
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:27,919
All right.

1143
01:08:29,377 --> 01:08:30,336
Great story.

1144
01:08:30,336 --> 01:08:31,793
All right. Private,

1145
01:08:31,793 --> 01:08:36,090
what would you say
would be the lesson

1146
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:37,432
that we have
learned here today?

1147
01:08:37,432 --> 01:08:39,542
Uh, the lesson is that,
when you're on a mission,

1148
01:08:39,542 --> 01:08:41,154
a deadly mission--

1149
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:42,650
Deadly mission.

1150
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:45,834
It's all about having
the right mix of guys.

1151
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,596
And in that mix, there's
got to be the wild card.

1152
01:08:51,204 --> 01:08:53,353
Vegas was the wild card.

1153
01:08:55,271 --> 01:08:56,230
And so am I.

1154
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:58,186
Mm-hmm.
You got that right.

1155
01:08:58,186 --> 01:09:00,488
And what has become
of the wild card, Vegas?

1156
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:03,442
He's dead.

1157
01:09:05,782 --> 01:09:07,278
He died in prison.

1158
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:12,073
Jesus.
He got caught?

1159
01:09:13,262 --> 01:09:16,178
Took about, what, 24 hours.

1160
01:09:16,178 --> 01:09:17,559
Cops come knocking
on Clyde's door,

1161
01:09:17,559 --> 01:09:19,553
they flip him,
go to the bar,

1162
01:09:19,553 --> 01:09:21,203
find Vegas--

1163
01:09:22,814 --> 01:09:25,039
Only takes one fucking rat
to bring the whole house down.

1164
01:09:29,988 --> 01:09:31,791
Jesus, dude. What are you
looking at me for?

1165
01:09:33,824 --> 01:09:36,279
I'm sorry.

1166
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:38,964
You know, my mom always told
me it was impolite to stare.

1167
01:09:42,992 --> 01:09:44,373
Come on, dude.

1168
01:09:44,373 --> 01:09:46,368
I mean, what about
the other guys?

1169
01:09:48,785 --> 01:09:51,470
What about the other guys?

1170
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:54,347
Well, McCoy didn't
see nothing.

1171
01:09:56,381 --> 01:09:58,184
And Angel--

1172
01:09:59,181 --> 01:10:03,286
Well, kind of
lost his head.

1173
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:04,897
<i>I am making this video</i>

1174
01:10:04,897 --> 01:10:06,968
<i>to expose a situation
that happened to my squad</i>

1175
01:10:06,968 --> 01:10:08,963
<i>that I think people
should know about.</i>

1176
01:10:08,963 --> 01:10:10,996
<i>I'm hiding my identity
from the public</i>

1177
01:10:10,996 --> 01:10:12,953
<i>because I'm afraid
that the F.B.I.,</i>

1178
01:10:12,953 --> 01:10:14,717
<i>and the Department
of Defense,</i>

1179
01:10:14,717 --> 01:10:16,866
<i>and even the Insurgents
can trace my I.D.</i>

1180
01:10:16,866 --> 01:10:18,323
<i>and find me.</i>

1181
01:10:18,323 --> 01:10:19,781
<i>They already got
one of my guys,</i>

1182
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:21,354
<i>and I'm not going
to take any chances.</i>

1183
01:10:21,354 --> 01:10:24,346
<i>But this needs to be said.</i>

1184
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:26,418
<i>For legal reasons,
and for my personal safety,</i>

1185
01:10:26,418 --> 01:10:28,604
<i>I cannot reveal
the time or the place</i>

1186
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:29,909
<i>or the soldiers involved,</i>

1187
01:10:29,909 --> 01:10:31,827
<i>but believe me, everything
I'm about to tell you,</i>

1188
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:34,013
<i>everything is absolutely true.</i>

1189
01:10:35,893 --> 01:10:38,003
<i>When I was stationed
in the Middle East,</i>

1190
01:10:38,003 --> 01:10:40,727
<i>two men from my squad
raped and killed</i>

1191
01:10:40,727 --> 01:10:43,911
<i>a 15-year-old girl,
killed her little sister,</i>

1192
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:46,366
<i>killed her mother,
and killed her grandfather</i>

1193
01:10:46,366 --> 01:10:50,010
<i>and no one has done
a thing about it.</i>

1194
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,353
<i>I'm posting this
on the Internet</i>

1195
01:10:51,353 --> 01:10:53,002
<i>in hopes that someone
from my squad,</i>

1196
01:10:53,002 --> 01:10:55,342
<i>anyone, will see it,
and will help me, please,</i>

1197
01:10:55,342 --> 01:10:57,567
<i>bring this forward, and
bring this out into the light.</i>

1198
01:10:59,179 --> 01:11:00,751
Did you see the woman
being raped?

1199
01:11:01,365 --> 01:11:04,357
Yeir. Well, uh,
not really.

1200
01:11:04,357 --> 01:11:06,621
Rush was holding her down
when I went outside.

1201
01:11:06,621 --> 01:11:09,153
Well, to do what?
To get away.

1202
01:11:09,153 --> 01:11:11,454
I didn't think they were
actually going to do it.

1203
01:11:11,454 --> 01:11:12,835
How did you know her?

1204
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,482
Flake put a gun in my face
and told me to go on watch.

1205
01:11:15,482 --> 01:11:16,710
How did you know her?

1206
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:19,740
She would go in and out
of our checkpoint every day.

1207
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,428
Rush would take a little
extra time with her.

1208
01:11:21,428 --> 01:11:22,848
Said he was just
being thorough.

1209
01:11:22,848 --> 01:11:24,305
And why did you
make this assumption

1210
01:11:24,305 --> 01:11:26,147
that she was a girl
and not a woman?

1211
01:11:26,147 --> 01:11:28,679
Because she was
younger than that.

1212
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:31,172
She didn't look that old,
so I just assumed that she--

1213
01:11:31,172 --> 01:11:34,318
Wasn't she an insurgent,
resisting arrest?

1214
01:11:34,318 --> 01:11:36,236
Uh, no. No.

1215
01:11:36,236 --> 01:11:38,691
She was just a girl.
She was scared to death.

1216
01:11:38,691 --> 01:11:40,724
How do you know
she wasn't scared to death

1217
01:11:40,724 --> 01:11:43,448
because she was an insurgent
resisting arrest?

1218
01:11:43,448 --> 01:11:44,906
Because, um,

1219
01:11:44,906 --> 01:11:47,744
Flake said that we were
going to get this girl

1220
01:11:47,744 --> 01:11:48,895
and "have a little fun."

1221
01:11:48,895 --> 01:11:50,698
Oh, that's new.
When did he say that?

1222
01:11:50,698 --> 01:11:52,731
He said it when we were
playing poker one night.

1223
01:11:52,731 --> 01:11:54,112
I thought he was
just kidding around.

1224
01:11:54,112 --> 01:11:55,724
Did you see Flake
rape her?

1225
01:11:55,724 --> 01:11:57,373
No, I told you.
I went outside.

1226
01:11:57,411 --> 01:11:59,752
So what did you see?
I didn't see him ra--

1227
01:11:59,752 --> 01:12:02,437
I heard some shots.
I heard some screams.

1228
01:12:02,437 --> 01:12:04,393
Then what happened?
Then I went up the stairs,

1229
01:12:04,393 --> 01:12:06,542
and I saw Salazar, and he
told me what happened inside.

1230
01:12:06,542 --> 01:12:08,268
You didn't actually
see him shoot her.

1231
01:12:08,268 --> 01:12:10,761
No, but Flake had a gun
pointed at her head--

1232
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:12,296
So did Salazar and Rush
have guns?

1233
01:12:12,296 --> 01:12:14,482
Yes, sir. Rush had a gun.
Did you have a gun?

1234
01:12:14,482 --> 01:12:16,285
Yes, sir, I did. Couldn't
Rush have shot her?

1235
01:12:16,285 --> 01:12:17,283
No! I--
Couldn't you have shot her?

1236
01:12:17,283 --> 01:12:19,469
I didn't shoot the girl.

1237
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:21,733
But when you saw her,
she was still alive.

1238
01:12:21,733 --> 01:12:23,382
I told you. I didn't
go back inside.

1239
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:26,298
Salazar said-- We're not
interested in what Salazar said.

1240
01:12:26,298 --> 01:12:27,449
We're interested in
what you saw.

1241
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:29,405
Flake shot her
in the face!

1242
01:12:29,405 --> 01:12:31,361
So you believed
she was dead.

1243
01:12:31,361 --> 01:12:32,934
Yes! I believed
she was dead.

1244
01:12:32,934 --> 01:12:34,661
But you didn't
see him shoot her.

1245
01:12:34,661 --> 01:12:35,811
No, but I didn't know--

1246
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:37,231
And you didn't
see him rape her.

1247
01:12:37,231 --> 01:12:38,382
No, but that's
not the point!

1248
01:12:38,382 --> 01:12:39,724
What is the point?

1249
01:12:39,724 --> 01:12:42,832
Isn't your testimony that you
were outside keeping watch?

1250
01:12:42,832 --> 01:12:44,865
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to see it,

1251
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:46,668
and I didn't want
to be a part of it.

1252
01:12:46,668 --> 01:12:47,435
Why don't you believe me?

1253
01:12:47,435 --> 01:12:49,200
This is the scene

1254
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,734
of one of the most
shocking crimes

1255
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:52,115
alleged to have been
carried out

1256
01:12:52,115 --> 01:12:54,148
by American
soldiers in Iraq.

1257
01:12:54,148 --> 01:12:56,143
According to evidence
at the hearing,

1258
01:12:56,143 --> 01:12:57,908
one July evening,
four U.S. soldiers

1259
01:12:57,908 --> 01:12:59,289
came to this house here.

1260
01:13:01,475 --> 01:13:03,854
According to Lawyer McCoy's
statement,

1261
01:13:03,854 --> 01:13:05,235
Reno Flake and B.B. Rush

1262
01:13:05,235 --> 01:13:07,498
repeatedly raped
a 15-year-old girl.

1263
01:13:09,033 --> 01:13:10,337
In another room,

1264
01:13:10,337 --> 01:13:12,792
the girl's grandfather,
mother, and little sister

1265
01:13:12,792 --> 01:13:14,135
were shot dead.

1266
01:13:16,283 --> 01:13:18,508
This man, Private Reno Flake,

1267
01:13:18,508 --> 01:13:20,695
is accused of committing
all the murders.

1268
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:22,421
His accomplice,
B.B. Rush, was taken--

1269
01:13:22,421 --> 01:13:25,682
We were securing the area.

1270
01:13:25,682 --> 01:13:28,866
We checked everyone
and everything.

1271
01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:32,625
And that girl went in
and out of our checkpoint

1272
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:36,269
again and again.

1273
01:13:36,269 --> 01:13:38,187
So, yeah, I checked
her thoroughly.

1274
01:13:38,187 --> 01:13:40,451
Every fucking time, because there
was something fishy about her.

1275
01:13:40,451 --> 01:13:44,517
"Fishy"? What exactly do you
mean by fishy, Specialist Rush?

1276
01:13:44,517 --> 01:13:46,167
Fishy, fishy, like
she was up to something.

1277
01:13:49,236 --> 01:13:50,962
And I'll deal you
one more card.

1278
01:13:52,918 --> 01:13:55,412
It's angel faces
like hers

1279
01:13:55,412 --> 01:13:58,251
that are going to walk right up to
you and give you a great big smile,

1280
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:01,051
and then blow you
the fuck apart.

1281
01:14:04,849 --> 01:14:06,537
And sure as shit,
the next day,

1282
01:14:06,537 --> 01:14:08,378
the very
next fucking day,

1283
01:14:08,378 --> 01:14:09,836
one of my best buddies

1284
01:14:09,836 --> 01:14:11,869
got torched on a path that
she just walked right over.

1285
01:14:13,173 --> 01:14:15,437
Didn't miss a beat.

1286
01:14:15,437 --> 01:14:17,431
So don't you dare sit there
for one second and think

1287
01:14:17,431 --> 01:14:19,618
that she didn't know where
that fuckin' IED was planted.

1288
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,183
You know, I went back
to the house because

1289
01:14:24,183 --> 01:14:26,868
I knew they were hiding
weapons and shit?

1290
01:14:26,868 --> 01:14:30,398
I mean, hell,
that old man,

1291
01:14:30,398 --> 01:14:35,001
broken back, tried to
shoot me with an AK-47.

1292
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:37,418
You know-- Hey--

1293
01:14:37,418 --> 01:14:38,607
It really
pisses me off, sir,

1294
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:39,719
when I think of everything

1295
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:40,947
we've done for these
sand niggers?

1296
01:14:40,947 --> 01:14:43,709
Got rid of Saddam,
planted democracy,

1297
01:14:43,747 --> 01:14:46,394
giving up our lives to keep them
safe from their own insurgents,

1298
01:14:46,394 --> 01:14:48,965
and I'm not looking
for a thank-you, but--

1299
01:14:48,965 --> 01:14:51,074
I want them to stop
trying to kill us!

1300
01:14:51,074 --> 01:14:53,721
Mm-hmm. Did you
find these weapons

1301
01:14:53,721 --> 01:14:56,215
before or after
you raped the girl?

1302
01:14:57,442 --> 01:14:59,744
Raped?

1303
01:14:59,744 --> 01:15:01,010
I mean--

1304
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:07,838
<i>That hajji bitch
was all over me.</i>

1305
01:15:07,838 --> 01:15:10,524
What, bombing and shooting them is okay,

1306
01:15:10,524 --> 01:15:12,557
but fucking them
isn't.

1307
01:15:14,053 --> 01:15:16,777
I mean,
who-- who says--

1308
01:15:16,777 --> 01:15:18,311
Do you say?

1309
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:19,462
Who says their pussies
aren't better

1310
01:15:19,462 --> 01:15:20,575
than their
hearts and minds?

1311
01:15:20,575 --> 01:15:22,224
Would you answer
the question, Pratt?

1312
01:15:22,224 --> 01:15:24,334
This is bullshit.

1313
01:15:24,334 --> 01:15:25,408
Just a, you know--

1314
01:15:25,408 --> 01:15:26,674
It's
a dog and pony show

1315
01:15:26,674 --> 01:15:28,055
for the folks
back home, right?

1316
01:15:28,055 --> 01:15:30,050
I'm just one of those
bad apples, huh?

1317
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:32,198
Soldiers
like B.B. Rush and I?

1318
01:15:33,924 --> 01:15:37,837
We're keeping the Arab
scum off your doorstep.

1319
01:15:37,837 --> 01:15:41,712
We shouldn't be in here
answering this crap.

1320
01:15:41,712 --> 01:15:43,745
Let me tell you
something, sir.

1321
01:15:45,356 --> 01:15:48,080
We should be out,
doing our job,

1322
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,727
boots on the ground,

1323
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:51,839
finding the bad guys,

1324
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,949
putting two in the heart
and one in the head,

1325
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:55,023
keeping America safe

1326
01:15:55,023 --> 01:15:56,328
and making sure
the motherfucker's dead.

1327
01:15:58,246 --> 01:16:00,049
You prosecute
guys like us.

1328
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:04,767
You're just aiding
the terrorists.

1329
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:20,764
<i>A quick death...</i>

1330
01:16:20,764 --> 01:16:23,104
<i>is too good
for this brainwashed,</i>

1331
01:16:23,104 --> 01:16:25,636
<i>racist Nazi fuck.</i>

1332
01:16:25,636 --> 01:16:29,894
<i>This stormtrooper needs
to be stripped naked</i>

1333
01:16:29,894 --> 01:16:32,004
<i>and strung up by his feet.</i>

1334
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,421
<i>Then, what's left
of the family--</i>

1335
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:36,070
<i>you know,
the ones he didn't shoot</i>

1336
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:37,451
<i>or set on fire--</i>

1337
01:16:37,451 --> 01:16:39,484
<i>the family of that
poor little girl</i>

1338
01:16:39,484 --> 01:16:41,517
<i>should be given
baseball bats,</i>

1339
01:16:41,517 --> 01:16:43,359
<i>white-hot branding irons,</i>

1340
01:16:43,359 --> 01:16:45,507
<i>blow torches,
dull knives, pliers,</i>

1341
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:47,157
<i>and, of course, rocks,</i>

1342
01:16:47,157 --> 01:16:49,458
<i>and be told
to go to town!</i>

1343
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:51,338
<i>This is the same monster</i>

1344
01:16:51,338 --> 01:16:53,870
<i>immortalized in every
fucking movie about Vietnam.</i>

1345
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:56,248
<i>"Let's do the whole
fucking village!"</i>

1346
01:16:56,248 --> 01:16:58,588
<i>You don't see the My Lai
massacre in the movies</i>

1347
01:16:58,588 --> 01:17:01,235
<i>because the truths
of that fascist orgy</i>

1348
01:17:01,235 --> 01:17:03,767
<i>are just too hellish for even
liberal Hollywood to cop to.</i>

1349
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:05,148
<i>Oh, but that doesn't
stop them</i>

1350
01:17:05,148 --> 01:17:06,836
<i>making another movie
about 9/11</i>

1351
01:17:06,836 --> 01:17:10,059
<i>because an American life
is worth so much more</i>

1352
01:17:10,059 --> 01:17:11,900
<i>than a Vietnamese,
a Palestinian,</i>

1353
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,434
<i>a Lebanese,
or an Iraqi life</i>

1354
01:17:13,434 --> 01:17:15,659
<i>because we
are the uber race.</i>

1355
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:18,575
<i>Sieg heil, motherfucker!</i>

1356
01:17:18,575 --> 01:17:21,107
Oh. Okay. Okay, that's great.

1357
01:17:22,066 --> 01:17:24,214
All right. All right, now--

1358
01:17:24,214 --> 01:17:25,710
Hey, McCoy--
Woman!

1359
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:26,861
...I'm not
getting your faces.

1360
01:17:26,861 --> 01:17:28,932
Come on, I want you
to turn toward me.

1361
01:17:28,932 --> 01:17:29,891
Come on, come on.

1362
01:17:29,891 --> 01:17:31,042
Look in the lens here.

1363
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:32,385
All right, all right,
all right.

1364
01:17:32,385 --> 01:17:33,536
Hurry up.
Take your picture.

1365
01:17:33,536 --> 01:17:34,687
ALl right, here we go.

1366
01:17:34,687 --> 01:17:36,221
Ready? Come on. Face me.
Here we go.

1367
01:17:36,221 --> 01:17:37,564
Here we go.

1368
01:17:37,564 --> 01:17:38,906
Come on, Judy, look at me.

1369
01:17:38,906 --> 01:17:40,594
Here we go. 1, 2--

1370
01:17:40,594 --> 01:17:42,436
No, I got to go
fix my face.

1371
01:17:42,436 --> 01:17:43,817
Your-- What?
Your face is fine.

1372
01:17:43,817 --> 01:17:45,198
It's just--
I'll fix my lipstick.

1373
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:46,195
It's perfectly fine.

1374
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:47,653
You look great! Judy!

1375
01:17:47,653 --> 01:17:48,804
Okay.

1376
01:17:51,911 --> 01:17:53,062
How about a war story?

1377
01:17:53,062 --> 01:17:54,021
Yeah, how about not?

1378
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:55,057
Oh, yeah.
Come on.

1379
01:17:55,057 --> 01:17:56,054
There are no war stories.

1380
01:17:56,054 --> 01:17:57,282
Tell us a war story.

1381
01:17:57,282 --> 01:17:58,739
You don't want to hear
a war story.

1382
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:00,657
Sure we do. Tell us
what you did out there.

1383
01:18:00,657 --> 01:18:01,271
Did you kill
anybody?

1384
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,417
Come on!
Let's hear one.

1385
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:05,798
Do you want to hear
a war story?

1386
01:18:05,798 --> 01:18:06,834
Absolutely.

1387
01:18:06,834 --> 01:18:09,020
Do you really want
to hear a war story?

1388
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,133
Very much so.
Absolutely.

1389
01:18:10,133 --> 01:18:11,706
All right. Here's
a war story for you.

1390
01:18:11,706 --> 01:18:13,432
Uh...

1391
01:18:13,432 --> 01:18:14,621
when I first went over there,

1392
01:18:14,621 --> 01:18:16,424
to Afghanistan,

1393
01:18:16,424 --> 01:18:19,800
I was, uh, I was all amped up
to kill for my country.

1394
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,677
I was ready to just kick
some ass, you know?

1395
01:18:22,677 --> 01:18:24,749
Get some licks in for what
they did to the Towers.

1396
01:18:24,749 --> 01:18:26,590
Just be a big fucking
war hero.

1397
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:27,357
Right on! Yeah!

1398
01:18:27,357 --> 01:18:29,314
I get over to Iraq,

1399
01:18:29,314 --> 01:18:33,226
and man, it's just--

1400
01:18:33,226 --> 01:18:36,564
it's just a totally
different story.

1401
01:18:36,564 --> 01:18:40,285
You grow up really,
really fast over there

1402
01:18:40,285 --> 01:18:41,551
because everything you see,

1403
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:44,390
everywhere you look
is just death,

1404
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:46,998
and it's suffering.

1405
01:18:46,998 --> 01:18:49,530
And the killing
that I did do,

1406
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:52,292
it made me sick to my stomach

1407
01:18:52,292 --> 01:18:55,476
because of these smells
and these sounds

1408
01:18:55,476 --> 01:18:56,589
and these images.

1409
01:18:56,589 --> 01:18:59,696
I have these-- these
snapshots in my brain

1410
01:18:59,696 --> 01:19:01,883
that are burned
in there forever,

1411
01:19:01,883 --> 01:19:05,067
and I don't know what the fuck
I'm going to do about them.

1412
01:19:05,067 --> 01:19:06,831
And what was I doing there?

1413
01:19:06,831 --> 01:19:07,982
What was I
doing in a country

1414
01:19:07,982 --> 01:19:09,555
that's done nothing
to me?

1415
01:19:09,555 --> 01:19:12,317
Just following orders?
Bullshit. Bull shit.

1416
01:19:14,849 --> 01:19:18,071
You better have a really
good fucking reason

1417
01:19:18,071 --> 01:19:19,951
for one of your buddies
to die in your arms,

1418
01:19:19,951 --> 01:19:22,444
to be blown up
right in front of you.

1419
01:19:22,444 --> 01:19:24,324
A really good
fucking reason.

1420
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:28,697
And I saw some shit
there, man. I just--

1421
01:19:31,114 --> 01:19:33,147
I just don't know how
I'm going to live with.

1422
01:19:35,564 --> 01:19:37,827
I went on a raid
in Samarra.

1423
01:19:38,978 --> 01:19:40,935
And two men from my unit

1424
01:19:40,935 --> 01:19:46,420
raped and killed
a 15-year-old girl

1425
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,840
and burned her body.

1426
01:19:49,758 --> 01:19:51,599
And I didn't do
anything to stop it.

1427
01:19:54,131 --> 01:19:55,205
Oh, no.

1428
01:19:56,816 --> 01:19:58,581
No, no.

1429
01:19:58,581 --> 01:20:01,075
This is a celebration
for a war hero.

1430
01:20:01,075 --> 01:20:03,069
Come on, come on.
Celebration!

1431
01:20:03,069 --> 01:20:04,949
To Lawyer McCoy!

1432
01:20:04,949 --> 01:20:05,946
Come on, come on.

1433
01:20:05,946 --> 01:20:07,826
And I'm going
to get my picture here.

1434
01:20:07,826 --> 01:20:10,588
Okay. Okay. Okay, McCoy.
Here we go.

1435
01:20:10,588 --> 01:20:12,199
Look at the camera.
Come on, Judy.

1436
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:13,811
Look at us here.
Here we go.

1437
01:20:13,811 --> 01:20:15,844
1, 2, 3--
