Sequels.
It's the only time I gave in in my life.
But sometimes,
you gotta do it the studio way.
What are you talking about?
- Get Lost?
- Yeah.
I thought the first one
was pretty good.
- Get Leo?
- Terrific picture. Terrific!
And you know what else?
It was good.
You know what I'm thinking, Tommy?
I'm thinking of getting out
of the movie business.
Go back to my old job.
- What, being a shylock?
- Yeah.
Why?
'Cause at least they're honest
about being dishonest.
Come on. Why would you
wanna leave all this?
Hello!
See? I'm telling you, this town.
Look, Chil.
You and me, we come out
to Hollywood, sniff the air,
and now look at us, man.
We made it!
And you know why?
'Cause we knew how to hustle a deal.
Yeah, like I got hustled
into doing the sequel.
That sucks.
Do you know that unless
you're willing to use the R rating,
you can only say the F-word once?
- You're kiddin' me.
- No.
You know what I say?
Fuck that.
I'm done.
Before you skate out of the business,
I got a movie for you.
Oh, yeah? What?
About NTL.
What's NTL?
"What's NTL?"
What, are you joking?
- No.
- You're pulling my chain.
Nothing To Lose Records.
Hello. Come on.
It's, like, the indie label.
I sign bands, I produce their albums,
I sell the distribution to the majors.
- Now you wanna make movies?
- Yeah! Who doesn't?
All right, can you pitch it
in 25 words or less?
I can do it in one word... Me!
- You?
- Me! Hello! Me!
I couldn't get your mother
to watch that movie.
My life in the music business.
Come on! Gangsta rappers,
the Russian mafia, you know?
All that goddamn payola crap.
This place is
like the wild, wild west, man.
You're dodgin' the bullets,
you're taking the arrows.
And it's got a girl.
There always is.
Her name's Linda Moon.
She plays a girl who wants to
make it big in the biz,
and I am the record mogul
who makes it happen.
Anyway, it's a musical,
and Linda's been trying to get me
on the two-way ever since,
you know, she saw you
on Charlie Rose.
Where you were very smooth,
and found out that I knew you.
I said you would help her out,
and she left you on the list
at the Viper Room
expecting you to show up.
So, Tommy, how's your wife?
- Edie?
- Yeah.
Who gives a shit?
Don't be a buzzkill.
Where are you goin'?
I gotta go to the men's.
I just had two iced teas.
But how about... Hey, Chili,
how does the movie sound?
Well, you don't have a movie yet.
You've got a premise and a setting,
but you don't have character arcs or a plot.
Okay, but still. You know.
Hey, who's gonna play me?
Think about that.
How about Carrot Top?
Do svidanhiya.
Hey, Marla.
Long time no see.
Yeah.
How's organized crime treatin' ya?
A little more exciting now
that you're in town.
Oh, yeah?
So, Mr. Palmer, we've got reason
to believe that this was a mob hit.
Trust me, if this were a mob hit, they'd
have hired a man who knew how to shoot.
He hit him in the chest.
Finally.
After he shot up my Caddy.
What a shame.
Can you confirm that this fella was
wearing a toupee?
Stevie Wonder could confirm
that he was wearing a toupee.
So out of the blue, this Mr. Athens
just decides to look up your number
and give you a call?
I know what you're gettin' at, Marla.
You think I set him up.
The truth is Tommy wanted me
to do a movie about him.
But you can't do a movie
where the main character gets popped
in the first scene, now, can you?
Yeah. It's not a bad opening.
You know, you're right.
That worked for American Beauty.
Sunset Boulevard.
Or Casino.
Mr. Palmer.
I'm Glenn from Thrifty Executive Fleet.
May I escort you to your vehicle?
But of course.
Marla.
Detective.
There you go, sir.
W hat's that?
I asked for a Cadillac.
The Insight is the Cadillac
of gas-electric hybrid cars.
Not only is it fuel-efficient,
it's great for the environment.
- I got it.
- Thanks.
- Hey, Martin.
- Chili!
- How are you doin'?
- How are you doin', Chil?
- Good to see you, Martin.
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
You know Hy Gordon?
What's up, Chili Palmer?
He did the soundtrack for Get Lost.
What's up, man?
Sorry.
Hy's taking me around.
I'm doing a little research.
For my next part.
I'm gonna play Johnny.
The Man In Black.
Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.
- Oh, Johnny Cash.
- Yeah!
- But he's like six-feet-something.
- That's okay.
You don't... You know, low angles.
You know, the movies?
Hey, Chili, is that your car?
Yeah, it's an Insight.
It's the Cadillac of hybrids.
It's a little tight for a big guy like you.
Small price to pay
for the environment.
Fifty-seven miles to the gallon.
But what about speed?
No, Martin.
If you're important, people will wait.
Just one shot, Marty.
Marty, one smile for me, come on.
My love, yeah
You've got the best of my love
Demonstrated love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
The way I feel about you, babe,
I can't explain it
Want the whole wide world
to see that
Oh, but in my heart
You're all I need
You for me and me for you
It's growing every day
You've got the best of me, yeah
You've got the best of my love
You got me, yeah
Givin' you the best of my love
You've got the best of my love
Givin' you the best of my love
You've got the best of my love
That's true.
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's what it's about.
You have to let it go halfway.
You can't be always tryin' so damn hard.
- Linda.
- Yo!
- Yo, I ain't sellin' that.
- Raji, no, I...
That ain't sexy. You better go
put your chick shit back on.
I can't put that on right now.
I have a meeting.
I'm telling you, there's people out here
paid to come see this shit.
Give me one second.
Baby, I just told you
to put your clothes on, didn't I?
- I can't!
- Did I not tell you that?
- Look!
- Don't "look" me again!
- Mr. Palmer?
- Call me Chili.
- It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.
Please, have a seat.
- Can I get you something to drink?
- I have something coming.
- So, Tommy's gone?
- Yeah.
I can't believe it.
I guess this means
you're not doing the movie?
Well, I gotta be honest
with you, Linda.
I'm getting out of the movie business.
Here you go.
What's the matter?
I'm tired of this, Mr. Palmer.
Look, if I can get some cash,
I would buy my way out of my contract
and get out of music.
Are you kidding?
After what I just saw?
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it sucks.
Look, I could do the same thing topless
and make $2,000 a week with tips.
Well, why don't you do that?
I'm Baptist.
My father wouldn't approve.
So then you're like Aretha Franklin.
You learned to sing in church.
I learned from my father.
My dad was in a jazz band.
Nothing big, though.
See, everything I know about music
I learned from him.
I always thought we'd play together,
but then...
...then he died, so...
Yo, Linda! Yo!
I didn't dismiss you.
You're on my time.
That's my manager Raji
with Miss Bangkok.
I told him I want to quit
and he's, like, "You quit me, girl,
I'm gonna jack you up."
He talks like that?
He thinks he's black.
His real name is Roger Lowenthal.
He's partners with this guy
named Nick Carr.
He's this music promoter?
I know Nicky.
They caught me
straight off the bus from Texas.
Said they'd make me this big star
and like a fool, I believed 'em.
When you done turnin' tricks,
get your ass back over here!
I ain't done with you yet!
Look, I can't do five more years.
Not with these guys.
Who's the big guy?
That's Elliot Wihelm,
Raji's bodyguard.
He's got this thing
that he can raise one eyebrow,
give you that look.
He wants to be in movies.
What, that's it?
He just does the one eyebrow?
As far as I know, he's gay, too.
Word is he once threw a guy out of
a 30-story building for calling him a fag.
Well, he must've been mad.
Maybe if you didn't blow
all your energy bangin' tourists,
your voice wouldn't sound so flat.
Talkin' about a flat voice,
you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, that one was for me,
so you just relax.
You're gonna end up doing
fifty-cent lap dances at the First King
like Miss Bangkok.
Chil, wait.
You don't know these guys.
They're bad guys.
Trust me, Linda, I know 'em
a whole lot better than you do.
...doin' some ass-poppin'
all up and down a pole.
You'd be up in that place
goin' pop, pop, pop.
Pop, pop, pop.
What are you gonna say?
Nothing more than I have to, if that.
Ass-poppin'.
Snap, crackle, pop!
Chili, wait.
Man in the suit.
You in town
for some kind of convention?
No, but if I was,
you'd be the man to see, am I right?
Why would you say
somethin' stupid like that?
The way you're dressed,
you're either a pimp or a limo driver.
We've got jokes?
You some kind of weak-ass comedian?
Raji, look at me.
I'm lookin' at you, man.
You say you're looking at me,
but are you really looking at me?
I'm really lookin' at you.
You got somethin' stupid to say?
Say it, so I can be done with you.
Linda's quit.
- She's out of the Chicks.
- Man, miss me with that.
She's got five years left
on her contract.
Well, I just cancelled it.
You come walkin' out of the dark.
Who you supposed to be?
I'm the one settin' you straight.
I'm Linda's new manager.
Come on, honey.
- Elliot, light his ass up.
- Got it.
You're Elliot Wihelm, aren't you?
You're an actor.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. Chili Palmer.
I'm a producer.
I did the film Get Leo.
Do you remember?
Sure, yeah.
It's great to meet you.
You know, I walk into a club,
and I see a guy like you,
and I say, "He's got the look.
But does he have the talent?
Can he act?"
Watch this.
Elliot! Elliot!
Goddamn, what you doin', man?
What?
Breathe. Up. Up.
You okay?
Yeah.
You can do better than him.
Why don't you send me
some pictures, I'll give you a call,
set you up for an audition.
All right, I'm in the Will Smith building.
Linda, you better talk to me.
Good day.
It's like that, huh?
Okay.
Okay!
I got an audition, Raj.
I need to get my headshots.
Edie?
Chili? Is that you?
Yeah.
Man!
So glad you came.
Well, I'm sorry,
and if there's anything I can do...
Thanks.
So, how are you doing?
You know.
You were right there
when it happened, weren't you?
Well, I was in the men's.
But you were with him
in his last hour, right?
I... I've had him cremated,
and I wanted to do something special
with his ashes, you know.
Maybe something he'd like.
Do you got any ideas?
Well, nothing that makes sense.
Say, Edie, is that
an Aerosmith tattoo on your back?
Yeah.
You know I followed them
on tour, right?
I didn't know that.
I thought Joe Perry was so hot.
Yeah?
So you were a groupie?
No, man, much worse.
I did their laundry.
They travel
with their own washer and dryer.
I did everything
except Steven's stage clothes.
You know, he likes
to send those out.
So, Edie, I was thinking, you know, maybe
I could help you out with NTL Records.
What makes you think
I need your help?
Nothin'.
Look, Chili...
let me tell you somethin'.
I started NTL with Tommy.
Right.
- Equal partners.
- Yeah.
And who do you think
found the Dub MD's?
I did.
Tommy's gone.
And I'm devastated,
but I'm not about to roll over.
I can run my own label.
If anybody could, it's you.
Hey, Edie.
Why don't you get your clothes on
and let's get outta here, okay?
Make you feel better.
Besides, I wanna talk to you
about this girl Linda Moon.
- Linda Moon?
- Yeah. She's a singer.
Here, put this on.
You know, I never made it
with any of those guys from Aerosmith.
Yeah?
I played tennis
with Tom Hamilton once, though.
Christ.
I was just a girl then.
You'll always be a girl.
Chil, thank you.
- Who's this?
- That's Tiffany, Tommy's intern.
How ya doing?
What's that?
Pizza.
He means the urn, genius.
Tommy.
You know, the cops
came by NTL last night.
They were asking me about you.
Yeah? What'd you say?
Nothing. Just that you were
gonna make a movie about Tommy.
It'd have to be a short.
They take anything?
Some boxes, a few files.
But I think
what they were lookin' for was this.
Thanks.
Here.
- Where'd you get this?
- Some guy with a Russian accent.
It's NTL.
You know, about a month ago,
he starts coming by,
lookin' for Tommy.
Tommy's in the office, what,
like three hours a week?
So, this last time,
he takes a picture.
He comes in,
doesn't even ask for Tommy,
lights it on fire,
and just tosses it on my desk.
No questions, no nothing.
Two days later, he comes back
and this time, Tommy's in.
So I interrupt his meeting,
and I buzz him.
He comes flying out of his office,
walks up to the guy,
nails him right in the eye.
Just like that scene in Get Leo.
Then he tosses the guy on his ass
right in the middle of the street.
I'm like, "Tommy,
who the hell was that?"
Insurance salesman.
Okay.
An insurance salesman.
Insurance scam.
I mean, geez, even I know that.
Guy takes a picture
of your business,
says either you pay up
or he puts your place on fire.
Well, you know, Edie,
that was Tommy's specialty in Brooklyn.
He sold protection.
He could write a book
on the different ways to work it.
Did this guy have a toupee?
Not after Tommy hit him.
Good morning.
Carosell Entertainment.
You see the Chicks International?
I think these girls are gonna be big,
the next big act to break.
- Take my word for this.
- What's up, Nick?
I'm telling you!
This Linda Moon.
Is she a g-string diva or what?
They give you wood?
What's up, man?
I need to talk to you, Nick.
They give me mahogany.
Goddamn teak.
You could deck the QE 2
with the wood they gave me.
Who even cares if they can sing?
Look, man, Chili Palmer
came up in the club. I gotta...
You're still my bitch.
Love ya. Out.
Man, we gotta talk
about this Chili Palmer.
Robin, who's on three?
Robert's on three,
Marty's on four.
Don't be...
Marty, you pimp.
Make me smile.
Nick. Nick, for real.
Look, I'm serious, man.
I need to talk to you here.
- No. No, you did not.
- Can I talk to you for a minute, man?
Marty, hold on a sec, will you?
What do you want, Raj?
It says in the paper that Chili Palmer
used to be a gangster.
He was a hired hand.
You know him?
Tell me what you want, Raj.
Linda Moon says she's gonna leave
and have Chili Palmer be her manager.
She told you that?
No, man, he told me that.
What'd you do?
I told him she's got five years
on her contract, you know.
You feel you had to explain it to him?
You didn't kick his ass?
Man, he hit Elliot
right in the damn throat.
He broke him smooth down.
Wow. What a surprise.
Elliot's a faggot.
Pussy.
You think it's cool to have a queer
for a bodyguard?
What good is he?
Chili Palmer's no manager.
He's a talker.
You shoulda hit him in the mouth.
What he does is make movies
about shylocks, 'cause that's all he was.
A shylock.
That's right.
He did that movie Get Lost.
That's my shit, man.
That shit was tight.
There is no way
we are losing Linda Moon.
"A," she's under contract,
and "B," she's under contract.
So, what's crackin'?
You want Joe Loop.
Man, all I want is
for Chili Palmer to disappear.
You want Joe Loop.
Yeah. Joe Loop.
Loop. Nick Carr said I should call.
Yeah, sure.
Well. I got something
for you to take care of
or do I need to call somebody else?
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.
I would love to.
Here's your breakfast, sweetie.
Pancakes again?
Panca... Yes, pancakes again.
Baby, would you tell this girl
when we were comin' up,
all we had was sugar sandwiches?
Please. She does not know
how good she has it.
She does not know
how good she has it.
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, Momy.
Bye, baby.
Deshawn, eat the pancakes, okay?
I put cinnamon on there,
there's butter, they're very good.
The strawberries are fresh.
Eat up.
We got ten minutes, okay?
I don't want you to be late.
Top of the morning, Marge.
Top of the morning, Sin.
Ain't this somethin'?
What's up, dawg?
Must you play into the stereotypes?
Turn that mess down.
This is the suburbs.
I'm on the damn Neighborhood Watch.
- Who did it?
- Not me.
You know, that bitch
owed me 300 grand.
I shoulda sent the coalition.
Now shit's gonna have to get ugly.
Ugly?
Why you trippin'?
It ain't like you need it.
Dabu, it's the principle.
Today it's 300 grand,
tomorrow it's three million.
I gotta send a message.
I feel ya, dawg.
You talk to the PD?
The police?
"The poli..."
The program director.
Check this out.
Well, hello, Mr. Program Director.
You see what happen
when you don't spin my records?
Good morning, guys!
Hey, y'all, speak to my daughter.
Good morning, Deshawn!
Deshawn, sweetie,
why don't you go back inside?
Okay?
Daddy's having a little meeting.
I'll take you to school in my car.
Bye, guys!
Good-bye, Deshawn!
Okay, boo-boo.
All right.
Play my records!
You hear me? Play! Play!
Play my records!
Play Dub Records! Dub MD's!
- Move yo' head. Move it.
- Stay still!
She gone?
I'm telling you, Edie,
she's got a voice,
she's got the attitude.
- You're gonna love her.
- Sounds like you love her.
Well, if you're asking me
if I think she's talented, yes.
I can't believe this.
Condolences on a two-way and
half of them are Tommy's ex-girlfriends.
Look, Chil, producing an album,
you know, it's not like making a movie.
Good.
I think movies are too corporate.
I like to be spontaneous and creative.
I'm just saying, you know,
the music biz is a bitch, you know?
It's dangerous.
It's rough out there.
Believe me, I know.
That's why I loved working at
MoMo's club, if you know what I mean.
What'd you do at MoMo's?
You book bands?
Not really.
- Were you a bouncer?
- Not really.
You really were a shylock,
weren't you?
Did I tell you
that she writes her own music?
Here she is.
Here we go.
You ready to show off?
Chili, look, I'm so sorry,
but my damn replacement didn't show up.
I ended up stuck in the drive-through.
It's all right.
Calm down, calm down.
Edie, Linda.
Linda, this is Edie Athens.
This is Tommy's widow.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Look, I'm really sorry about being late.
- Don't worry about it.
So Chili tells me
you've got a great voice.
Really?
Well, you do.
That is so sweet.
Thank you.
Is this where you play?
I can't really afford my own piano,
so they let me play here.
Come on, let's go hear you.
Yeah? Let's go.
Life is what you make it
At least that's what they say
Well, I think I'm gonna make it
Fulfill my dreams someday
I feel this fire growing
Deep inside of me
I'm so inspired knowing
that it's my destiny
I breathe like a champion
I dream like a champion
I see I'm a champion
It's meant to be
My will's getting stronger
I can't wait any longer
I'm singing a song
that's inside of me
'Cause I'm a believer
I know that I can make it
no matter what they say
'Cause I'm a believer
The future is now
It starts today
I'm impressed.
Did you write that song?
Yeah. It's called I'm A Believer.
Just tell us you got
nine more just like it.
Forty more.
But as long as I can do 'em my way.
I like that.
- Let's get you in the studio.
- All right.
Good girl.
You weren't kidding.
I mean, the girl's got something.
- She's amazing.
- I told you.
I mean, the only thing is, you know,
it costs a lot of money
to break someone, you know?
I mean, we gotta pay a mixer,
a publicist.
Hey, look.
- Steven Tyler's in town.
- Yeah.
Aerosmith playing
at the Staples Center.
Tell me Dream On is not the greatest
rock 'n' roll song you ever heard.
You know what we oughta do,
we oughta call him.
- Call who?
- Steven.
Why?
So he could listen to Linda's music,
he could see for himself it's terrific,
and maybe he'll help us launch her
at his concert.
- That's a great idea, Chil.
- Yeah.
Hey, and maybe
Bono and Sting'll come down
and we could all cut
a Christmas album.
You know him, don't you?
Know him? Steven Tyler.
Chili, I know his socks!
He's never gonna remember me.
Edie, you have a tattoo of Aerosmith
on your ass.
You can't get a meeting with him?
We want Steven Tyler,
we get Steven Tyler.
I would let the music
do the talking to me
to tell me what lyrics to sing.
And even when I got caught up
in not having anything pre-written,
Which I never did. I would scat to it.
It's just the music.
It's the funhk.
It's the sound. It's the words.
It's the rhyme. It's the shit.
You can't be creative
unless you step outside a little bit.
It's...
A little early, aren't you?
Open house is on Sunday.
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's Chili Palmer.
- Yo. Chil.
- How soon can you get here?
2:00 A.M.
And there's traffic on the 405.
- Who's your friend?
- I don't know.
I come home and he's bleeding
all over my one-sheet.
Is this the guy that did Tommy Athens?
Nah. That guy had a black eye
and was wearing a rug.
This ain't no rug, pal.
This guy's got plugs.
I hate plugs.
It looks like doll's hair.
Personally, I think grafting's
the only way to go.
The look's more natural.
That's, of course,
'cause they use your own hair.
Very interesting.
Now are you gonna
help me out with him?
Is that why you called me here?
Yeah. You're a big guy.
I don't want to do it alone.
Come on, up.
Get this wallet outta here
before the cops come.
All right, set him down.
Here we go.
Ivan Surva...
He's Russian.
Been here for five months.
The guy that killed Tommy,
he saw you, right?
- Yeah.
- So you could I.D. Him.
Then he sees your picture
in the paper,
then he sends doll hair guy
here to take you out.
So while he was waiting for me,
he got depressed
and shot himself in the back?
Good point.
Who are all these people
trying to kill you?
I don't know.
But I'm in the music business now.
It could be anybody.
Mugambo, my brother,
you check out the Chicks?
I told you, bro.
This Linda Moon... she's a belter.
Mugambo, I gotta jump.
Love you, bro.
Get me Raji on the phone.
What's up?
It's Raji.
Hey. Lowenhthal. Joe Loops
was supposed to kill Chili Palmer.
Instead. he killed
some goddamn Russian.
For real?
You two better work this shit out
or your ass is next.
Stupid-ass.
I gotta tell you the truth.
I never seen a hit like this before.
I mean, you actually gotta get in line
to whack this guy.
How many men
have you whacked, Joe?
Why, you wanna be next?
I'm asking you
because you hit the wrong guy.
They serve one hell of
a stuffed cabbage here, you know that?
The thing that
you wanna remember though is
don't eat it too late
because it tends to stay with you.
Yeah. I'll definitely keep that in mind.
Where we at, Joe?
We ain't nowhere.
I now gotta go find the right guy.
The thing is it'll cost you
another five grand.
What are you talkin' about?
Man, I already paid you.
You're the one who did the wrong guy.
Well, whose fault is that?
It's your fault.
Tough shit.
That's the cost of doing business.
Look, you tell Nicky
that there's now a new contract,
and I need another five grand.
I can talk the deal with you,
'cause it's my contract, all right?
- That's why I'm here with you.
- You can't talk shit.
You're Nicky's girl.
Me and Nick are partners.
We discuss all facets
of the business together.
Be it music,
be it underworld, girls.
Let me ask you a question.
Nice get-up you got.
How come he calls you his bitch?
What?
His bitch.
Why does he call you his bitch?
What, mother...?!
Did I stutter?
What if I called you
a fat, stupid guinea bee-yatch?
Bee-yatch!
I'd take this baseball bat that I got
out in the back of my Cadillac,
and I'd swat you
across the mouth with it.
I said what if I called you that.
Hypothetically, just a scenario.
I wasn't actually saying it to you.
I'm always lookin' out.
I gotta operate.
I wanna make sure
I got the right guy.
Now I need the right guy
to get the right guy.
Now I want the five grand up front.
Tonight at the Mayan.
What? The what?
Take the wax
outta your goddamn ears.
The Mayan, downtown.
I never happen
to have heard of the Mayan,
so I was making sure
I knew where it was.
You mean there's something
you haven't heard of?
Okay, man.
All right, take off.
Are we cool?
Come on, man.
J. Leazy! What's up?
My man!
- All right. I feel that.
- Take off.
Mad respect for not giving respect.
I feel you.
Let me tell you something.
Don't do that "J. Leazy" shit.
That's what your name is.
I don't like that.
Don't do it.
I'll see you at the Mayan club, my man.
Mad respect to you, Loop.
Stone-face killer.
Next time try to find
something red to wear.
The future is now
It starts today
How about that?
Yeah, that girl's voice
is off the chain.
But I gotta say, she needs a sound.
What are you saying?
That she can't sing?
No. Chili, that girl can totally sing.
- What do you mean?
- But is she a star?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay. Take American Idol. okay?
All those girls, they can sing, right?
But who cares, right?
Who are they?
And then you take, like, J. Lo, and it's
like that shit's been remixed so much,
I could be Jenny from the block.
Are you gonna produce this or not?
Well, leave it to Tommy.
I mean, the last of the great spenders.
No wonder he kept
the books locked up.
All right, because they're empty.
We don't own any of this stuff.
We're broke.
How can that be?
I mean, you must have made a pile
off of Dub MD's alone.
That's Weapons of Mass Destruction.
I know who they are.
Yeah, well, whatever we made off them,
I can't find it in the books,
which means we can't afford
to record her,
which means no masters,
which means no CDs,
which sure as hell means
no more NTL Records.
Hello?
So, what'd you think?
I would love to produce your record.
And because I am going
to produce it, it will rock.
That's great.
So Capitol can miss you
for a few days?
I think we can negotiate that.
Wait, you were with Capitol?
I was supposed to meet
an A&R guy over there,
but then I signed with Nick Carr.
Excuse me, Linda.
Did you just say
you're under contract with Nick Carr?
No, not anymore.
Actually, Chili told Raji
that it was cancelled.
Linda? Why don't you
take a break, honey?
All right.
Chili, it doesn't work like that, okay?
I mean, you've gotta
get the contract back from him.
Otherwise, he still runs the show.
Edie, I was a shylock.
I know how these things work.
I've known Nicky for years.
You'll get your contract.
Slight problem.
This could be ugly.
- Why is that?
- That's Sin LaSalle.
He manages and produces
the Dub MD's.
Tommy owe him money?
I would say yes.
- Tiffany, man the phones.
- Okay.
Hy, get in the office.
Look like you know what you're doing.
Edie, I want you behind the desk.
You're still the boss.
These guys need to see
that NTL is still in business.
Okay.
Where should I hide the books?
Leave them on the desk.
And whatever you do,
don't mention the Russians.
Don't mention the Russians.
Okay.
No. No, we're totally booked.
But that would've been good.
Hang on one second.
Sin, honey!
How are you?
Enough with the pleasantries.
Where's our money, Edie?
Sin.
Sin LaSalle. Man!
What's up?! Come on!
No?
Okay, you know what?
I totally get it, man.
I totally get it.
First of all, welcome to NTL.
Second of all,
I wanna introduce myself.
Hy Gordon.
I know who you are.
- See?
- Capitol Records.
Eight years ago,
you turned down our demo, Hyman.
You know what, Sin?
You know Capitol, man.
It's like art by comittee
over there, okay?
Personally, I totally, totally dug
all y'all's sound, all right?
Seriously, I'm thinkin'
about leavin' Capitol.
Look, Sin, you know,
Tommy left his will a mess.
You know, if you just give us
a few weeks...
Right. Then I'd call up
and the phone is disconnected.
Why don't you write us
a check for 300 grand
and we'll kindly be on our way.
Sin, you know we don't have
that kind of money on hand.
Then I need to check your books.
Be cool.
Be cool?
You don't know me.
I know you a whole lot better
than you think I do.
Ivy League rich kid.
Goes to Wharton.
Gets an MBA.
Puts on some Timberlands
and a throwback
and suddenly you got street cred?
Look, I'll tell you the truth, okay?
The Russians took it.
The what?
The Russians.
With one of those insurance scams.
You know, like "give us half a mil
and we won't kill you"?
And, Sin, you knew Tommy, right?
I mean, he never wanted any trouble.
I mean, he gave him
everything we have,
but these Russians,
okay, these monsters,
they're animals.
They kept on coming back
for more and more,
so Tommy told 'em get lost.
To make a long story short...
...I'm a widow now.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me, Chuckles.
It's my wife's cousin.
I really enjoyed that story, Edie.
I mean, Russians.
Russians.
I know it's hard, but...
I'm a highly educated man.
Sincerely, you don't expect me
to believe a story about some Russians.
Now, I suggest
that you open up those books
or things gonna get real ugly
up in here.
Sin, the books are
none of your business.
You'll get the money when NTL has it.
Dabu.
Thank you. Thank you!
Poppin' me is not gonna
do you any good.
But if you wait till Friday,
I get you your money plus the vig.
Plus the vig. All right.
All right, okay.
Everybody cool out.
Everybody calm down.
Calm down, calm down.
Wait, so you sayin' plus the vig?
Plus the vig.
All right. Okay.
All right, all right, cool.
All right, we gonna do this.
Dabu. Bu!
Never get to shoot nobody!
Never!
Don't never let me do
what I wanna do!
You know, it's a long day, man.
You'll get a chance
to kill somebody, all right?
Calm down.
We got some other stops to make today.
All right, so I'm not gonna
kill y'all today.
Now, I'll be generous.
But come Friday,
if you don't have my money,
the next meeting I arrange will be
between you and Tommy Athens,
if you get what I'm sayin'.
I feel ya.
You feel me. You...
Dabu.
Player.
The vig.
I mean, what's a vig?
Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?
You're gonna give him
your fancy equipment, okay?
Or you're gonna have a garage sale.
We're not selling anything.
Hey, where are you goin'?
Gotta see Nicky Carr.
Black Eyed Peas are playing tonight,
if you're interested.
You say there's a dark parking lot
by the Mayan, right?
Why you trippin' on me, Elliot?
Are you still crying
over that Chili Palmer shit?
No. He just... he said
he was gonna call me, that's all.
And did he call you back?
He's just messing
with your head, man!
Ain't no Samoan faggot
going by the name Elliot Wihelm
is gonna make it to the big screen.
Raisin' a goddamn eyebrow.
I understand shit like this
'cause I ain't a homo.
Once you turn faggot,
you lose all self-respect.
You're not wired right.
Man, what the hell
you stoppin' the car here for?
Man, you crazy?
You move the car,
we can all get to work.
Man, why you
stopping the car here, man?
What are you doin'?
- Get your ass back in the car.
- I'm gonna kick your ass.
Steering wheel's
in the front of the car, fool.
What's up? What?
You say it again and I quit.
What'd I say?
The faggot thing?
The homo?
Man, I'm walkin'.
I ain't even trippin', man.
I'm... What'd I say?
What'd I say?
Okay, Elliot, I know you frustrated
with all this bodyguard shit and whatnot.
I smell you, man.
I feel you pain.
This shit's temporary.
Stop crowdin' my shit.
When I signed you four years ago,
I said, "Man, that man can sing."
I said, "He's gonna be a big star."
A big star, man.
That's why I laid out all the paper
to put you up in a video.
I put paper down, man,
to put you in a video.
Right?
No one else
on this damn beach has a video.
Man, I love you like a brother.
I used to bag on you all the time.
Man, you trippin'.
Why you doin' that, man?
Wanna take a shot at me, kid?
Do it.
Do it!
I'm just sayin' if that's what this
is gonna be, then it's gonna be that.
But I would prefer to stay
on the same page.
Man, let your voice be your ladder.
Man, I'm serious.
This acting shit
got you acting crazy, man.
What's up?
You know I love you, man.
Come on, man.
E. Weazy!
Come on, baby!
E. Weazy!
Come on, baby.
E. Weazy.
Come on, I'm clownin', baby.
You know I'm clownin'.
Turn around 'cause you know I'm clownin'.
Come on, player, stop hatin'.
Stop hatin'.
Start participatin'.
Start participatin', star.
Come on, twinkle, twinkle, baby.
Twinkle, twinkle.
Come on, Larry.
You sound like an A&R guy.
I'm bangin' the phones
like a goddamn wild man.
Larry, I'll call you back.
I heard Sean Penn lives up here.
- You see him much?
- Not as much as I'd like.
How'd you get in here?
Your maid left the back door open.
- I don't have a maid.
- I can tell.
Come on. Get out of here
before I have to shoot you.
Nah, Nicky, sit down
and stop being such a hard-on.
So, Mr. Red Hot Chili Pepper.
I heard you were at the Viper Room.
So Raji told you about Linda Moon.
She's something else, huh?
The heart and soul of that group.
I'm telling you, bro,
the Chicks are gonna be big.
How's that?
By singing songs from the '70s?
Don't laugh.
You see, you're a movie guy,
so you don't know,
but the music biz,
it goes in cycles.
It's like Linda.
When I signed her,
girl power was dead.
It was the era
of the singer-songwriter.
But now the market's flooded.
What do the labels want?
Girl groups.
Nicky, look at me.
I am.
I want Linda's contract.
If you want to produce
Linda's album, great.
I'm sure you can even get
a buck a record.
But I got her booked
into some major gigs, bro.
And I'm two seconds away
from getting her a deal.
You mean you've had Linda for two years
and you've never gotten her a record deal?
Chili, a trio is not born overnight.
I've had her for three days,
and I already got her a label.
So it looks
like we don't need you, Nicky.
Let's get something straight.
This isn't the movies.
You can't tell everyone you're a wise guy
and charm their pants off.
This is the music business.
We're all wise guys.
All right, wise guy, I'll make you a deal.
Carosell, which is the dumbest name
I've ever heard for a company,
gives me Linda Moon's contract,
and if you ever threaten her
in any way,
you'll regret it
for as long as you live, if that.
That's some deal.
What's in it for me?
I'll just make-believe that that dead
Russian that I found in my house
had nothing to do with you.
You don't know
what you're doing, Chil.
What makes you even think
Linda could make it on her own?
She's got me.
He's gonna cry till I tell him
that I'll never roam
So, Chattanooga Choo-Choo,
won't you choo-choo me home?
So, you're like a rapper now?
Sniff Doggy Doo-doo.
You clownin' my gear again?
You know you like this, Joe.
Come on, Joe!
You know my style
makes the ladies smile.
They just started
Chattanhooga Choo-Choo.
I love that song.
I can't believe they did that.
Damn, man.
I wish I coulda heard that.
I like a good choo-choo song.
Look, do you want your money
or what, my man?
First off, I ain't your man,
you asshole.
You remember my driver Elliot.
Elliot, give this man the envelope.
Ain't you gonna count it?
Nick ain't got the balls to stiff me.
I like that idea you had
about having a bat in the car.
I had my man Elliot
go out and get one.
A red bat!
You don't send a queer to get a bat.
They like these shiny queer things.
What you want... It's not your fault...
What you want is a wood bat.
See, like a Louisville Slugger.
Let me see.
Hold this for me, please. Thank you.
You see, a bat like this,
it messes up a kid's swing.
You gotta take too long of a swipe
across the plate, you see?
He never develops those fast hands
you're gonna need for the majors,
you understand?
I don't know how fast
it's gotta be for my needs,
you know what I'm sayin' to you?
I ain't gonna be up in no majors...
You like that one, huh?
Here's your sandwich.
What's up?
Raji, I think he's chokin'.
You clownin' me?
Joe, are you clownin' with me?
You don't ever disrespect me!
One!
Raji, Raji, Raji.
Damn.
He's dead.
Man!
Talk all that shit, man.
This right here,
this was the cost of doin'... business!
All I want is some appreciation, Elliot.
Chili Palmer don't realize
how hard I work for Linda Moon.
I tried to make her a superstar!
What do I expect in return?
What do I expect in return?
My name on the damn CD so small
you can barely read the damn thing!
And where's that at?
Where's that always at?
On the back, at the bottom.
"Produced by Raji."
In tiny little letters, man!
And I will not let him
take that from me!
Now it's time I got some respect!
I will straight smoke Chili Palmer!
I didn't take you
for a Black Eyed Peas fan.
Well, when they hooked up
with Sergio Mendes, they won me over.
Do you ever think
about becoming a singer?
- A singer?
- Yeah.
Me?
Nah.
But I was a real live
Vegas showgirl once.
- Really?
- Yeah.
As soon as I was
done washing clothes, I got lucky.
One of those Tropicana revues,
you know?
Thanks.
Chili, I worked so hard starting NTL.
I'm a bit too old to go back to Vegas.
I want you to stop worrying.
We're gonna meet Steven Tyler.
You know, I would've liked
to seen you dance.
Yeah?
Well, you still can.
Yeah? How's that?
Do you dance, Chili?
Me? I'm from Brooklyn.
Okay, so we walk in the Staples Center
with Linda's CD.
- Right.
- And then what?
We put a gun to Steven's head
and say, "Linda's playing
with Aerosmith."
You really like the music business,
don't you, Chil?
Love it.
Me, too.
Tommy and me,
we had a few records on the air,
but I'd just like one time
to turn on the radio
and say, "That's my song.
I produced that."
Somethin', somethin' with soul.
You know?
Your hair's different, huh?
Yeah.
I had it trimed.
Good night, Chili.
All right.
Drive safe.
That's the pawn shop my friend
from the OC told me about.
It's surrounded by the Feds.
They're watching these Russians.
There he is.
- Oh, yeah.
- His name's Roman Bulkin.
What are you doin'?
Are you crazy?
They know what you look like.
What are you gonna tell 'em?
No more than I have to, if that.
- Onhe twenhty-two. George.
- That's 4-8-8 Sunset.
Subject's approaching
northwest corner.
You've got a lot of balls.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
There's half a dozen
undercover cops outside.
Don't give 'em a reason to come in.
Nyet!
Now, did you take this picture?
Go to hell, you greasy wop
son of a bitch.
Now you're the one
that's gonna need protection.
You go now.
Is that chest hair real?
