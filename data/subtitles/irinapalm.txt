IRINA PALM
by Sam Garbarski

3
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,078
Mom, it's a bit...

4
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:55,138
Yeah, I know, it's a lovely lion that want
to ruffle. Come on, let's go. We'll be late.

5
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,138
Alright.

6
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:31,614
- Nana!
- Hi, Olly!

7
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:33,374
Hi Dad!

8
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,765
- Who's my boy?
- Me!

9
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:37,922
- Maggie, you shouldn't have.
- Well -

10
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:51,719
Did you bring any water?

11
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:53,519
Sarah, don't, just...

12
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,103
But the water's fouled here.

13
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,693
Please! I just forgot.

14
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,674
Here.

15
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:00,355
Thanks.

16
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,712
Look, how nice you have done it!

17
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,795
Sold it for nothing.

18
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,134
All these treatments
and Olly's still ill.

19
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:29,202
We would never forgive ourselves
if we hadn't tried everything.

20
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:33,730
Anyway I don't regret a thing.
I'd sell up again tomorrow.

21
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:36,139
Why do you still come here?

22
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,887
Jane's not all bad.

23
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:47,872
Here's been something to do, I suppose.
It takes my mind off things. Anyway, thanks.

24
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:09,548
I couldn't resist.

25
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:11,020
Oh, Jane.

26
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:13,185
You shouldn't have.

27
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:15,925
Boys love that kind of thing.

28
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:21,096
Now, listen, Beth and
Julia are forging ahead.

29
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:25,206
I know things haven't been easy
but I'm getting a tinsy wincy bit bored about losing.

30
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,120
I want to save the smell of victory
just once

31
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:32,569
I want to see these wonderful
smiles wiped out their faces.

32
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:33,857
How's Olly?

33
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:38,211
Same as...
Oh, not really, he's -

34
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,324
He'll pull through Maggs.

35
00:05:58,465 --> 00:06:05,334
Mr and Mrs Cubine, I've just examined Olly
and Olly's condition is deteriorating.

36
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:14,721
There is a new treatment, in the
Orphan Diseases' Congress in Melbourne.

37
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:21,422
I'm referring Olly's case to a
specialist consultant in London.

38
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,721
Last throw of the dice?

39
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:29,705
Yes.

40
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:06,681
You're in luck, they're going to take him.

41
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,773
You should leave as soon as possible.

42
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:12,247
- Leave?
- Yes, Australia.

43
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:13,444
What?

44
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,241
I assumed you knew.

45
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:17,382
It's the only place they do it.

46
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,588
- You can't do it here?
- No.

47
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:22,653
- We have to go there?
- Yes.

48
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,401
Who pays?

49
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,534
When can we take him?

50
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:32,616
Frankly as soon as possible.

51
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:36,812
Should he stay beyond 6 weeks or so,
he'll be too weak to travel.

52
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:38,376
Who pays?

53
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:41,911
The treatment is pro bono. All
other costs, hospital, travel

54
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:45,519
- et cetera will have to be matched.
- Oh, yes.

55
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,452
We will find the money. You knew -

56
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,041
Give it a rest, mom.

57
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:27,211
We can borrow.

58
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,787
We can nothing!

59
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:31,188
Nobody will loan us any more money,
the whole village have already donated.

60
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:32,902
Shut up, shut up!

61
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:34,813
- At least mom's trying to help.
- Shut up!

62
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:41,234
Hey, look, I just want to go
home, okay. Just take me home.

63
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:47,689
I can find my own way home.
It's okay.

64
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:50,079
It's... go on, go on.

65
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:32,280
You already heavily in debts, you got
nothing to borrow against.

66
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:39,529
I mean you got no income, you got no savings...
and you don't own your home anymore.

67
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,246
My grandson is dying. I need money.

68
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,220
You have no skills, no employment
history and no qualifications.

69
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:09,094
What is it that you think
I can do for you?

70
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,704
Look, I'm gonna be honest. Your age is gonna
be almost impossible to find you anything.

71
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,577
I'm sorry.

72
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,576
I've come about the job.

73
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:47,184
Go on, last door.

74
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:05,230
A job?

75
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:09,337
Do you know what goes on here?

76
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,685
Do you know what a hostess does?

77
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,668
Sort of.

78
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:16,874
Sort of?

79
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:19,714
What kind of sort of?

80
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,576
Sort of things.

81
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:23,837
Things?

82
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:32,354
Things like making tea and clearing up...
those sort of things.

83
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:37,171
Here the word hostess is a euphemism.

84
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:40,142
Do you know what euphemism is?

85
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:41,914
No.

86
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:45,550
...my lawyer explained it to me.

87
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:50,055
When you use one word for another.

88
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:57,114
For example, here, hostess means whore.

89
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:05,311
Ok. What kind of hostess are you?

90
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:12,547
Straight, kinky, many special tricks.

91
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,372
No, listen, here, Mr -

92
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:21,601
Pecklush. If you're good
and I like you, Miky.

93
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:26,830
You are not working girl.

94
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:31,643
I bet you can't even say "fuck". Can you?

95
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:35,885
You're too old.

96
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:40,760
Show me your hands.

97
00:13:43,475 --> 00:13:46,853
Show me your hands.
I'm not going to bite.

98
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:48,101
Give me your hands.

99
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,570
They're pretty.

100
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,327
And smooth.

101
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:14,782
Very smooth. Many girls work here,
their hands are ok, but -

102
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:18,175
I think we'll have a bit less
of that -

103
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:24,596
Okay, this is the deal:
men come here to see

104
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:28,456
to touch, to be toched
by women, you understand?

105
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,085
Can you wank men off?

106
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:36,714
What?

107
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:39,617
Can you wank men off?

108
00:14:39,652 --> 00:14:41,085
What?

109
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:45,964
Can you... wank men off?

110
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:58,616
Hmm, yes... no, I mean, if I'm being honest
it's been a long long time since I -

111
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:03,820
Pity, hands like yours are made
for those sort of things.

112
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:07,859
I think I better go.

113
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:10,666
Start at £600 a week.

114
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,557
How much?

115
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:16,884
If you heighten with your hands and else, £900.

116
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,534
What's the matter? Lost your husband?

117
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:06,813
What?

118
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,188
I've come about the job.

119
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:21,571
Japan.

120
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:26,494
I see them in Tokyo, bring them here.

121
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:31,723
No one else has something
like this except Sexy World.

122
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:34,007
Nobody but me.

123
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:41,599
You press this button, red
bump tell them you're ready.

124
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:51,424
They have 5, 6 minutes. Any longer

125
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:56,408
you press this botton and if
they don't come, I come.

126
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,820
This is Luisa, she will show you the ropes.

127
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:03,744
Hello.

128
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:05,916
Hi.

129
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:08,698
- Phone.
- Yeah.

130
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:13,026
You have a whole evening.

131
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,339
Okay.

132
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:28,719
Time to go to work.

133
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,108
Sorry.

134
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,984
What, now?

135
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,607
First, you get a good grip.

136
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:46,593
See? See how it stiffens.

137
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:52,087
Circumcised are so sensitive, grip tighter.

138
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:58,012
Speed is important,
make sure to change, like this.

139
00:19:58,528 --> 00:19:59,825
Oh, God!

140
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:02,794
Bloody Hell!

141
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:06,644
Oh, fuck!

142
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:12,863
Oh, fucking!

143
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:19,171
Do they always go on like that?

144
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,089
No, only him. Watch.

145
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:25,892
After slow, fast again.

146
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,767
The harder it gets, the faster you go.

147
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:37,314
Remember, you are in control.

148
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:57,279
See, it's easy.

149
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,249
Next time, you do.

150
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:09,095
Who? Me?

151
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:10,654
Who else?

152
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:12,683
No, no, no, no, I really can't.

153
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:14,488
Okay, if you wanna leave?

154
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,013
Oh, come on, sit down.

155
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:25,302
First time is always the most embarassing,
but after that you went for England.

156
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:29,576
Give me your hand.

157
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,028
Your hand!

158
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,698
I really think - I think you
should do it just one more time.

159
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,011
Your hand.

160
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,173
Bloody hell!

161
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:51,822
Part of the job.

162
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,610
No, no, I can't.

163
00:21:57,104 --> 00:21:57,951
Come on.

164
00:21:58,434 --> 00:21:59,480
Relax. Up - Relax.

165
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:03,566
Up and down, slowly.

166
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:06,719
Slowly, relax.

167
00:22:07,896 --> 00:22:10,866
It's too soft.

168
00:22:11,817 --> 00:22:13,709
Ha!
- Sorry!

169
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:21,081
Relax, that's good.

170
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:24,099
Gently but firm. That's good.

171
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:35,318
All the way along.

172
00:22:39,406 --> 00:22:40,458
Yes, like that. That's it...

173
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:57,851
She's worth the trouble?

174
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:00,843
It's funny.

175
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:03,182
Of course it's funny.
But is she worth it or not?

176
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:10,616
She has a soft touch... It could be.

177
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:14,566
What day is it?

178
00:23:16,257 --> 00:23:17,360
Wednesday.

179
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,315
You've got till Friday.

180
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:04,731
Now, have you got your ticket?

181
00:24:06,674 --> 00:24:07,996
On time.

182
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,628
Maggie! Where are you off to?

183
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,144
Magg, are you alright?

184
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:49,924
Need anything?

185
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,926
You can go home, now.

186
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,681
Hi, leave your message after the beep.

187
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:31,785
Just me, Maggs. What's got into you?

188
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,854
Julia find all the thing bizarre.
Where are you now? In this time of night.

189
00:29:39,638 --> 00:29:41,357
Give me a call. Soon.

190
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:17,251
Still here, where's mom?

191
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:19,289
You should go and live with your mother.

192
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,574
Maggie.

193
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:53,859
Mr Pecklush.

194
00:31:15,152 --> 00:31:17,809
Hey, do you need a drink, uh?

195
00:31:30,863 --> 00:31:33,335
We met when I was 17.

196
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:37,678
Trevor was older, full of himself.

197
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:42,913
I didn't know any better.
Who does, at that age?

198
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:45,771
Ended up pregnant.

199
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:48,621
Home had nothing to offer.

200
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:53,617
So I got married.

201
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,355
Came down here

202
00:31:57,684 --> 00:32:00,406
but then I lost the baby.

203
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:07,136
Tom arrived 12 years later.

204
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:11,308
Quite a surprise to say the least.

205
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:15,026
We plodded on.

206
00:32:20,028 --> 00:32:21,407
And Trevor died.

207
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:26,701
7 years ago. Heart attack.

208
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:35,437
And just after that, Olly became ill.

209
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:41,527
And... and here I am.

210
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,913
The Wanky Widow.

211
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,292
Yes.

212
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:52,367
My husband was a pig.

213
00:32:52,976 --> 00:32:53,931
He beat me. So...

214
00:32:58,524 --> 00:32:59,603
So I left.

215
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:05,808
Bastard. Now, one for the road?

216
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:08,154
Yes, why not?

217
00:33:12,295 --> 00:33:14,245
Chris, two more.

218
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:22,219
Don't tell me to stop.

219
00:33:24,518 --> 00:33:25,981
I promised Tom I wouldn't.

220
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:30,685
I think about stopping every day.

221
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:35,937
But then I think: screw it, I
deserve all the cigarettes in the world.

222
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:07,804
Dear Mr Cooper, we regret to inform
you in this occasion we are not...

223
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:09,477
in a position to offer
the loan as requested.

224
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:16,000
Thank you.

225
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:25,570
And... I'll have 5 of these,
the hundred thousand ones, please.

226
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,717
Feeling lucky, are we?

227
00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:37,666
Oh, I thought I had more,
I'm sorry, I'll have 4 of them.

228
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,228
Hi.

229
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:20,088
£200? But this isn't -
You, you said -

230
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:23,001
I said monday you earn 6-8,
if you work. And don't cry.

231
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:27,446
I make the rules.

232
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:41,888
Mom? This time I come from the rest of the washing.
... going back to the hospital...

233
00:35:45,527 --> 00:35:46,358
You alright, mom?

234
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:50,561
Me? No, I mean YES. Why?

235
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,363
Well, it's jus you haven't been to
the hospital for a while and...

236
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:56,716
it's not like you, that's all.

237
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,863
I thought maybe you were ill or something.

238
00:35:58,898 --> 00:36:00,482
No, no, I'm okay.

239
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:04,717
You know me, same old me.

240
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:07,699
I'll be in tomorrow.

241
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:09,468
Promise.

242
00:36:09,827 --> 00:36:11,964
Good, Olly is missing you.

243
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:15,498
Thanks mom.

244
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:46,131
How is he?

245
00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:53,475
You need to rest.

246
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:57,757
I've been turned down again.

247
00:36:58,442 --> 00:36:59,396
I know.

248
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:03,289
I don't know what to think any more.

249
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:08,804
I can't... just don't know what to do anymore.

250
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:14,771
Doctor said in about 4 weeks
he'll be to weak to... to

251
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:16,403
to...

252
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,684
I love him so much.

253
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:25,578
I really love him.

254
00:39:12,357 --> 00:39:13,357
£640

255
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,549
I need more. I need -

256
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:33,875
A name.

257
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:36,662
A name you'll earn more.

258
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,627
Irina Palm.

259
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:42,834
I like Irina.

260
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:46,226
Where I come from there are
many beautiful Irinas.

261
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:50,644
First girl I did it with, she was an Irina.

262
00:39:52,994 --> 00:39:54,956
They see Irina, they think -

263
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:57,134
Some sexy young girl.

264
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:00,322
Not a middle-aged frump.

265
00:40:01,129 --> 00:40:03,040
Frump? What is "frump"?

266
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:08,803
Someone like me. Dumb, middle-aged.

267
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:13,576
If you are so frumpy how can I make you Irina?

268
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:22,836
Don't be so shy, Irina... sexy.

269
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:26,447
You can be anyone. You know,
at home you are Maggie:

270
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:31,802
Clean, washed up, kids, all
the shit, but here: Irina.

271
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,105
You like being called Suzy Lush?

272
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:37,090
Who cares? Separate, always.

273
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:41,841
In the boot Suzy, at home with my
child Adam, with my friends, Luisa.

274
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:45,056
Forget, shit happens.

275
00:40:45,996 --> 00:40:47,634
Your round.

276
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:56,619
Been working hard?

277
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:02,737
Are you ignoring me?

278
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,189
I do think you've been just teenious
but selfish, don't you? Sneeking off

279
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:17,002
to heaven's know where. Leaving your closest
friend. Are we in some kind of race or something?

280
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,375
Maggs! Maggs, slow down.

281
00:41:21,656 --> 00:41:25,210
Maggs! What - Oh, for god's sake
What's got into you?

282
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:30,722
Maggs! Maggie, what's going on?

283
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:32,553
Please Jane, I'm late.

284
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:34,836
Late? Late for what?

285
00:41:35,274 --> 00:41:36,212
Late for work.

286
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:37,883
Late for work? Oh.

287
00:41:38,173 --> 00:41:40,380
You've got a job?
What job? Where?

288
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,555
- I've got to go.
- You're blushing.

289
00:41:42,757 --> 00:41:44,220
I'm not. I've got to go.

290
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:49,429
Don't follow me. Just don't.

291
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:54,085
A job?

292
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,461
A job? Where?

293
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:56,692
Where indeed.

294
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:57,888
Doing what?

295
00:41:58,743 --> 00:41:59,742
She wouldn't say.

296
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:01,382
Why not?

297
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,653
Maggie can't do anything, can she?

298
00:42:08,197 --> 00:42:10,482
Oh, God! Yes!

299
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:16,534
£750.

300
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:28,930
What?

301
00:42:30,002 --> 00:42:30,894
Nothing.

302
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:11,511
This one.

303
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:20,354
Hi Nana!

304
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,531
Look what I've found.

305
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:24,917
Lying in the street.

306
00:43:25,392 --> 00:43:26,901
No, you didn't.

307
00:43:29,465 --> 00:43:30,667
I can't stay long.

308
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,518
Why not? You're never here anymore.

309
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,048
Well, I've got things to do, Mr.

310
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:40,334
Like trying to make sure you get better.

311
00:43:41,231 --> 00:43:42,263
How?

312
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,935
It's a secret!

313
00:43:45,844 --> 00:43:47,936
I like secrets.

314
00:43:48,145 --> 00:43:53,989
Yes, but the thing about a secret
is that it has to stay a secret.

315
00:43:54,874 --> 00:43:58,048
And it will be a long time
before a can tell you this one.

316
00:44:05,427 --> 00:44:09,939
So, remember: shh!
It's a secret.

317
00:44:19,422 --> 00:44:20,368
Maggie!

318
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:22,209
You didn't tell us you were coming.

319
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:26,878
A flying visit, you know,
to keep his chin up.

320
00:44:27,817 --> 00:44:30,320
You look in a bit of a hurry.
Doing something special?

321
00:44:31,428 --> 00:44:36,637
No, not really, few things to do.
I must go.

322
00:45:15,116 --> 00:45:16,205
You're good.

323
00:45:17,683 --> 00:45:18,691
Thank you.

324
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:24,398
Not many women have your touch.

325
00:45:27,443 --> 00:45:28,415
I tried you out.

326
00:45:29,398 --> 00:45:31,430
You tried me out?

327
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:36,087
You are so -
How to say?

328
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:37,698
When?

329
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:40,201
Yesterday. Of course
I tried you out.

330
00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:45,975
I have to know. If I don't
know how do I build your future?

331
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,494
I want you to work more,
longer. Evenings.

332
00:45:53,513 --> 00:45:55,223
You can became big earner.

333
00:45:59,388 --> 00:46:01,279
I need £6,000.

334
00:46:01,503 --> 00:46:02,687
It's not a problem with you hands.

335
00:46:02,722 --> 00:46:05,021
Now, I need it now.

336
00:46:09,378 --> 00:46:11,504
That's it, I have enough of this.

337
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:16,140
Where are you going? £6,000 is a lot!

338
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:27,782
I don't have time to become a big earner.

339
00:46:28,362 --> 00:46:29,459
Why?

340
00:46:32,788 --> 00:46:37,973
Okay, if I give you... If!
What do I get?

341
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:43,832
I'll earn £800 a week minimum.

342
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:47,431
I will work for 10 more weeks.

343
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:54,993
So you get you're £6,000 and can
keep all the rest as interests.

344
00:47:02,365 --> 00:47:10,883
Okay. If you cheat me, I'll
find you, and I'll kill you.

345
00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:03,615
For the flights, the hotel, for the...
well, you know, the usual.

346
00:48:07,563 --> 00:48:09,805
It's enough, isn't it?

347
00:48:14,946 --> 00:48:16,554
I think I better go.

348
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,446
It'll be ready tomorrow.

349
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:37,074
Where did you get it?

350
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,868
Always the right elbow...
I don't know how to do it.

351
00:48:40,934 --> 00:48:42,275
Where did you get the money?

352
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,037
Well the stitch won't show, I hope.

353
00:48:47,964 --> 00:48:50,255
Mom, this is a lot of money,
where did you get it?

354
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:54,103
Listen to me! This if you're
gonna need it out there.

355
00:48:56,836 --> 00:49:00,139
Mom, can we just stop this for
a second, please, this is creepy.

356
00:49:00,736 --> 00:49:02,951
I just want to know you haven't
done something stupid.

357
00:49:02,986 --> 00:49:05,748
No, I haven't.

358
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:07,855
Then, where did you get the money?

359
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:10,073
I'm not telling you.

360
00:49:10,302 --> 00:49:11,588
And I never will.

361
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:12,996
Why?

362
00:49:14,642 --> 00:49:19,841
Because... you've got Olly to sort out.

363
00:49:21,095 --> 00:49:27,169
You've got flights to book, you've got
hotels to arrange. You're wasting time.

364
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:35,282
Okay.

365
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:51,246
No one's gonna break in.

366
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:54,148
Why don't you shout it a bit louder?
The end of the village didn't hear you.

367
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:08,932
Do you want me to keep reading?

368
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:11,824
Yes. Okay.

369
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,876
Arks edged closer

370
00:50:20,564 --> 00:50:25,220
...he saw a dark shadow in the oily water.

371
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:29,931
He looked at the shadow,
something very big.

372
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,488
Very dangerous.

373
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:38,790
"If only we could get a closer look at it!"
said Tex

374
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:48,866
Captain Osgast: "If the water level
keeps rising, he might swim up here.

375
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:53,026
and get a closer look. "

376
00:51:13,293 --> 00:51:15,318
Sorry. Train was late.

377
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:20,694
I said I'm sorry.

378
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:53,277
Oh! Yes!

379
00:52:05,406 --> 00:52:07,077
Oh! Yes!

380
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,898
Give me the shock of my life, you did.

381
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:22,917
I'm not telling you.

382
00:52:23,226 --> 00:52:23,561
Not telling me what?

383
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:25,861
Whatever it is you wanna know.

384
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:27,536
You don't know what I'm
going to ask you yet.

385
00:52:27,571 --> 00:52:28,768
I'm not telling you.

386
00:52:28,803 --> 00:52:30,837
Why? What's so bad?

387
00:52:30,872 --> 00:52:34,106
I'm not in trouble if that's what you're
worried about, I'm not that daft.

388
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,837
I'm not telling you.

389
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:40,498
Where did I put my scissors?

390
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,708
You really mean it, don't you?
You don't want me to know?

391
00:52:46,536 --> 00:52:47,345
No.

392
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:55,581
So, presumably, this is the reason why it's gonna
be years before you can tell Olly your secret?

393
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,957
What was that banging?

394
00:53:38,038 --> 00:53:40,816
You're crazy! Separate,
Maggie, Separate! Otherwise...

395
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:50,177
One week worked, £600 paid of debt.

396
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:54,743
9 weeks left, £5,400 still owed.

397
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:03,082
Is there anything else I need to know?

398
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:05,839
Like what?

399
00:54:06,816 --> 00:54:10,707
Like: will you be decorating
the rest of my club as well?

400
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,178
Can I go now?

401
00:54:42,217 --> 00:54:44,436
Who are you? You noisy cow!

402
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,433
What the fuck you think you're doing?

403
00:54:48,183 --> 00:54:49,217
Pervert!

404
00:55:12,764 --> 00:55:14,574
Penis Elbow.

405
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:16,672
Penis Elbow?

406
00:55:16,903 --> 00:55:20,503
Yes, tennis players get Tennis Elbow,
we get Penis Elbow.

407
00:55:22,049 --> 00:55:22,882
Penis Elbow.

408
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:26,004
Been busy?

409
00:55:27,597 --> 00:55:29,596
Rest it for a while.

410
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:33,726
Apply this morning and evening.

411
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:34,988
How long?

412
00:55:35,238 --> 00:55:36,759
A week, at least.

413
00:55:37,915 --> 00:55:40,851
You'll need to wear this for a while, as well.

414
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:48,616
Don't take it off, even at home.

415
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:53,553
Can you work with your left hand?

416
00:55:54,444 --> 00:55:55,366
Think so.

417
00:55:55,617 --> 00:55:56,428
Good.

418
00:56:33,994 --> 00:56:35,024
She's that good?

419
00:56:36,385 --> 00:56:38,478
Oh, yes.

420
00:56:39,648 --> 00:56:41,255
You should see the fucking queue.

421
00:56:44,161 --> 00:56:45,464
Find out a bit more about her.

422
00:56:48,604 --> 00:56:50,059
Don't let Miky find out.

423
00:56:57,225 --> 00:56:57,884
Tea?

424
00:56:58,088 --> 00:56:58,910
No, thanks.

425
00:56:58,945 --> 00:57:01,450
Just got the flights for next week on thursday.

426
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,635
Fine.

427
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,108
What's happened to your arm?

428
00:57:04,143 --> 00:57:05,790
This, nothing.

429
00:57:05,825 --> 00:57:08,842
Doesn't look like nothing, you've
got your arm in a sling, what happened?

430
00:57:09,056 --> 00:57:12,040
Nothing to tell, really, it's just a sprain.

431
00:57:12,725 --> 00:57:14,347
Doing what? What were you doing?

432
00:57:14,382 --> 00:57:15,782
Just cleaning.

433
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,102
Really, it's nothing dramatic.

434
00:57:19,742 --> 00:57:20,709
You got any bread left?

435
00:57:20,974 --> 00:57:22,884
Yes. It's in the bin.

436
00:57:24,503 --> 00:57:25,467
Thanks, mom.

437
00:57:25,502 --> 00:57:26,823
You're welcome.

438
00:57:26,858 --> 00:57:28,144
Give my love to Olly.

439
00:57:28,537 --> 00:57:29,929
Well, fine.

440
00:57:46,023 --> 00:57:48,594
Oh, been in the wars, have we?

441
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,930
Not really.

442
00:57:52,774 --> 00:57:53,743
Looks bad that.

443
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:56,731
Oh, no, it's - it's really nothing.

444
00:57:58,525 --> 00:57:59,555
I'll have a -

445
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,578
Arm in a sling?

446
00:58:02,697 --> 00:58:04,604
It's nothing, really.

447
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:06,700
So, how did it happen then?

448
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:14,870
I'll have a pint of milk, please Edith,
and two scouring pads, please.

449
00:58:18,266 --> 00:58:20,442
- Wrenched your arm, did you?
- No.

450
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,256
- Lifting?
- No.

451
00:58:22,486 --> 00:58:24,611
- Landing your bagging?
- No.

452
00:58:26,275 --> 00:58:28,430
So, just how did you do it then?

453
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:34,201
Wouldn't you like to know.

454
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:39,802
Thank you.

455
00:58:54,247 --> 00:58:55,325
Luisa, what's wrong?

456
00:58:56,007 --> 00:58:57,214
Fuck off!

457
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:05,495
Empty boot and not enough
clients is very bad image.

458
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,188
But you can't just sack her.

459
00:59:07,389 --> 00:59:10,421
I sack people every week.

460
00:59:10,456 --> 00:59:12,670
But how can you? She's got a kid!

461
00:59:12,705 --> 00:59:14,885
People work here to make profits.

462
00:59:15,312 --> 00:59:16,054
But -

463
00:59:16,089 --> 00:59:17,994
Clients want you, not her.

464
00:59:18,215 --> 00:59:21,128
She leaves, you stay.
It's business.

465
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,464
If I give up my job,
will you take her back?

466
00:59:24,499 --> 00:59:25,733
How? You owe me.

467
00:59:26,171 --> 00:59:28,231
You have 8 weeks left to pay your debt.

468
00:59:28,828 --> 00:59:31,817
Then you'll leave.
Business is that.

469
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:38,864
So that's what I am to you.

470
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,254
Business.

471
01:00:59,488 --> 01:01:00,392
What do you want?

472
01:01:05,071 --> 01:01:08,507
Look she's Maggie. She took my job.

473
01:01:20,037 --> 01:01:22,584
Doesn't sound too good, does it?

474
01:01:23,724 --> 01:01:27,333
Taking someone's job, my job,
you fucking bitch.

475
01:01:29,072 --> 01:01:30,241
Why you're here?

476
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:34,757
Why?

477
01:01:37,248 --> 01:01:43,915
Feel guilty or come to see how
poorly I live?

478
01:01:46,014 --> 01:01:47,263
Or come to help?

479
01:01:47,887 --> 01:01:49,600
I thought we were friends.

480
01:01:49,635 --> 01:01:57,623
Friends, yes. I had a good job,
good money. I help you, I teach you.

481
01:01:57,658 --> 01:02:01,167
I even told Miky how good you are.
And that's a friend, I think.

482
01:02:01,202 --> 01:02:02,971
And what did you do?

483
01:02:03,246 --> 01:02:04,452
I didn't do anything.

484
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:07,794
You didn't do anything? You took
my clients, you fucking tourist.

485
01:02:09,123 --> 01:02:09,572
Maybe -

486
01:02:09,607 --> 01:02:11,201
Maybe just fuck off.

487
01:02:30,743 --> 01:02:31,864
Got a cigarette?

488
01:02:51,649 --> 01:02:56,124
7 weeks left, £4,200 left to pay.

489
01:02:58,847 --> 01:02:59,928
How is your arm?

490
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:22,654
Miss Irina, please let me have
the honor to show you something.

491
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:25,213
Just across the road, here.

492
01:04:11,468 --> 01:04:13,110
Piazza Irina P.

493
01:04:27,502 --> 01:04:28,754
That's for the best pay.

494
01:04:32,572 --> 01:04:33,494
What happened to your arm?

495
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,212
Penis Elbow.

496
01:04:48,758 --> 01:04:52,090
You don't just wank the punters,
you train the girls.

497
01:04:52,528 --> 01:04:55,825
With you here, this'll be the
classiest place in Soho.

498
01:04:56,382 --> 01:05:00,873
And you get 15% of all the girls
earnings, on top of your own.

499
01:05:02,071 --> 01:05:03,103
What do you say?

500
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:05,385
But I still owe Miky.

501
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:11,906
How much do you owe?

502
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:14,839
Over £4,000.

503
01:05:19,986 --> 01:05:21,357
I'll take care of that.

504
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:26,391
You owe me. What do you say?

505
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:32,716
I've had an offer.

506
01:05:36,748 --> 01:05:37,728
Who?

507
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:44,602
Someone called Dave, Sex-o-Roma.

508
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:57,797
It's a lot of money.

509
01:06:02,987 --> 01:06:04,935
But I still owe you.

510
01:06:09,526 --> 01:06:11,839
Tell me when you leave.

511
01:06:47,669 --> 01:06:48,410
Where is she?

512
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:13,931
Maggie!

513
01:07:15,353 --> 01:07:16,403
Maggie, stop please.

514
01:07:16,438 --> 01:07:19,562
Why? I mean nothing to you.

515
01:07:20,356 --> 01:07:21,713
I'm just another Luisa.

516
01:07:22,635 --> 01:07:23,293
You are not Luisa.

517
01:07:24,982 --> 01:07:26,914
Of course not, I'm valuable.

518
01:07:27,563 --> 01:07:28,850
I'm business.

519
01:07:31,555 --> 01:07:35,481
6 girls, I don't know
what I was thinking,

520
01:07:36,871 --> 01:07:38,501
work in a place like that.

521
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:40,328
It's like being a Madam.

522
01:07:41,337 --> 01:07:43,000
What am I doing here Miky?

523
01:07:45,948 --> 01:07:47,309
I don't know what you are doing here.

524
01:07:47,619 --> 01:07:49,026
I just came for Olly.

525
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:50,361
Who is Olly?

526
01:07:50,575 --> 01:07:53,124
My grandson. He's dying.

527
01:07:53,729 --> 01:07:57,422
He's dying and I'm wanking. It's mess.

528
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:00,061
What am I gonna do?

529
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:04,685
But you said yes?

530
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,877
No, I didn't.
At least I think I didn't.

531
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:14,455
- What do you want to do?
- Stay.

532
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:20,883
You should smile more.

533
01:08:36,521 --> 01:08:37,369
Mom?

534
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:46,820
Hi Jane, it's me, Tom.

535
01:08:47,228 --> 01:08:48,368
Tom, do you know what time it is?

536
01:08:48,638 --> 01:08:52,021
Yes, I know, sorry it's late.
Is mom there? Just -

537
01:08:52,056 --> 01:08:55,992
Of course not, why would she be?
Is there a problem?

538
01:08:56,202 --> 01:08:58,870
No, it's nothing. I remember, a thing,
she's... she's somewhere else.

539
01:09:00,163 --> 01:09:00,900
Are you sure?

540
01:09:01,134 --> 01:09:03,716
Yes, okay, no, no, it's nothing.

541
01:09:03,751 --> 01:09:04,747
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

542
01:09:07,608 --> 01:09:09,187
She said it was a secret.

543
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,155
And?

544
01:09:21,392 --> 01:09:22,492
She left.

545
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:24,949
Went to America.

546
01:09:26,804 --> 01:09:33,647
Wanted to be a doctor or
find someone who could give her...

547
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:37,366
You never saw her again?

548
01:09:40,381 --> 01:09:41,680
No I can't.

549
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:47,977
How come you ended up
in a place like this?

550
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:50,852
I hate people.

551
01:10:00,857 --> 01:10:01,964
Mallorca.

552
01:10:12,047 --> 01:10:14,980
For retirement, if it's ever finished.

553
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:18,250
You know

554
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:24,594
I really do like your smile.

555
01:10:32,265 --> 01:10:34,351
I like the way you work.

556
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,724
Thanks for walking me.

557
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:00,586
What'll I do about Dave?

558
01:11:02,144 --> 01:11:04,237
I'll sort it out, it's okay.

559
01:11:19,143 --> 01:11:25,329
I think I better go,
I can't miss the last train.

560
01:12:07,257 --> 01:12:08,288
Pretty sling.

561
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:16,778
How's that feel?

562
01:12:18,997 --> 01:12:22,517
Not bad. It's a bit stiff.

563
01:12:22,853 --> 01:12:24,642
It'll be alright in a couple of days.

564
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:26,964
Ease yourself back into it.

565
01:12:31,104 --> 01:12:32,421
Take it easy.

566
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:37,807
Bye!

567
01:12:39,841 --> 01:12:42,128
Goodbye and thank you very much.

568
01:12:42,577 --> 01:12:47,891
It's nothing. It's been an
honor to treat Irina Palm.

569
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:53,785
Bye girls!

570
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:42,669
After next one tell Maggie
to come to my office.

571
01:17:08,371 --> 01:17:10,280
I just want to see if you're alright.

572
01:17:11,951 --> 01:17:15,091
Olly's dying, you're on the game,
sunshining, what more can I want?

573
01:17:15,341 --> 01:17:15,820
Tom.

574
01:17:15,855 --> 01:17:17,122
I'm taking that money back.

575
01:17:17,419 --> 01:17:19,046
I know you must be -

576
01:17:19,081 --> 01:17:20,478
You must be what?

577
01:17:20,513 --> 01:17:21,841
You must understand!

578
01:17:21,876 --> 01:17:25,591
No, I don't understand.
No, I don't understand, not a thing.

579
01:17:25,831 --> 01:17:29,770
I don't understand advanced maths,
I don't understand black holes

580
01:17:29,805 --> 01:17:32,304
or why people like the Beatles.
I don't understand, I don't understand

581
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:34,238
why my mother is a whore.

582
01:17:35,061 --> 01:17:36,318
I'm not a whore.

583
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:38,232
Tom, I think you should apologize..

584
01:17:38,267 --> 01:17:41,781
Sorry, sorry, sex worker. Isn't that
the bullshit term for a whore these days?

585
01:17:41,986 --> 01:17:44,922
I'm not a whore, take that back.

586
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:49,970
I'm paying that money back, every
penny. Every fucking penny!

587
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,440
Every penny, mom!

588
01:17:51,475 --> 01:17:52,440
Tom, please.

589
01:17:52,649 --> 01:17:57,398
Every penny, and it's not enough so in the world
that can clean what you've been doing.

590
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,043
- Tom are going to stop it now?
- Every slimy penny!

591
01:18:00,078 --> 01:18:01,281
We can't get the money back.

592
01:18:01,486 --> 01:18:03,753
Don't tell me what I can do!

593
01:18:03,788 --> 01:18:05,330
Stop telling me!

594
01:18:05,882 --> 01:18:10,123
For the last five years people have been
telling me: do this, do that

595
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:14,597
don't do this, don't do that,
try this, try that, don't try this,

596
01:18:14,819 --> 01:18:17,956
Just leave me alone!
Don't fucking tell me!

597
01:18:25,931 --> 01:18:28,558
I don't regret what I've done.

598
01:18:29,623 --> 01:18:32,398
And don't you ever call me that word again.

599
01:18:32,638 --> 01:18:38,476
If you ever set foot in that place again,
you'll never see Olly again.

600
01:18:39,686 --> 01:18:40,557
Ever.

601
01:18:41,014 --> 01:18:42,841
Never! Never!

602
01:18:43,478 --> 01:18:46,088
He will not have grandmother who's a whore.

603
01:19:14,045 --> 01:19:15,064
Tell them you're not coming back.

604
01:19:15,532 --> 01:19:16,422
Tom, I -

605
01:19:16,624 --> 01:19:17,718
You tell them, now!

606
01:19:18,343 --> 01:19:19,406
It's not that simple.

607
01:19:19,612 --> 01:19:21,673
I don't care mom.
You tell them now, please.

608
01:19:21,953 --> 01:19:24,486
Tell them now, right now,
right this minute. Tell them please!

609
01:19:30,867 --> 01:19:32,336
Sexy World.

610
01:19:40,195 --> 01:19:40,952
Hello?

611
01:19:41,682 --> 01:19:43,293
Can I speak to Miky, please?

612
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:44,576
Thank you.

613
01:19:47,009 --> 01:19:49,684
Miky, this is Maggie.

614
01:19:49,962 --> 01:19:50,824
What happened?

615
01:19:51,451 --> 01:19:53,969
I'm sorry but it's my son.

616
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:56,371
I won't be coming back.

617
01:19:56,682 --> 01:19:57,967
You have to.

618
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,315
Yes, I know -

619
01:20:00,827 --> 01:20:05,234
Listen, she's not ever coming back.
Do you hear?

620
01:20:05,683 --> 01:20:07,043
You're fucking money!
I'll bring it back!

621
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:08,957
Hi Maggie.

622
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:11,579
Hello.

623
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:13,115
Now meet the woman of mystery.

624
01:21:13,482 --> 01:21:15,750
Yes, what's all this about the job?

625
01:21:18,563 --> 01:21:19,722
It's no mystery.

626
01:21:19,926 --> 01:21:21,423
Why all the secrecy?

627
01:21:22,502 --> 01:21:24,705
I must say I was rather
shocked by your behaviour.

628
01:21:26,177 --> 01:21:28,161
I think someone's got a little secret.

629
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:30,423
Spill the beans, Maggs.

630
01:21:34,318 --> 01:21:37,740
I forgot sad Maggs, you wern't talking about
something remotely interesting.

631
01:21:40,959 --> 01:21:42,694
I wank men off.

632
01:21:44,927 --> 01:21:45,883
Wank?

633
01:21:49,128 --> 01:21:50,604
Masturbation?

634
01:21:52,978 --> 01:21:55,665
You masturbate men?

635
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,536
Is that boring enough for you?

636
01:22:01,474 --> 01:22:02,381
Why?

637
01:22:03,274 --> 01:22:04,572
Money.

638
01:22:05,599 --> 01:22:12,568
Whithout wishing to prime Maggs, how does it,
not really anyone business of course, but -

639
01:22:12,915 --> 01:22:16,035
How, how did you do?

640
01:22:18,227 --> 01:22:21,568
Well, they stick their cocks

641
01:22:24,787 --> 01:22:27,927
through a whole in the wall

642
01:22:34,118 --> 01:22:37,899
I wank them off, they come,

643
01:22:39,729 --> 01:22:41,326
end of story.

644
01:22:42,901 --> 01:22:48,766
Miky says I've got the best
right hand in London.

645
01:22:49,049 --> 01:22:49,911
Miky?

646
01:22:49,946 --> 01:22:51,417
Club owner.

647
01:22:57,234 --> 01:22:58,583
In Soho?

648
01:22:58,618 --> 01:22:59,933
Sexy World.

649
01:23:01,546 --> 01:23:03,061
I'm Irina Palm.

650
01:23:03,949 --> 01:23:05,261
I'm the best.

651
01:23:07,355 --> 01:23:08,965
Irina Palm?

652
01:23:09,248 --> 01:23:10,857
Stage name.

653
01:23:11,065 --> 01:23:12,552
Everyone has one.

654
01:23:13,753 --> 01:23:16,858
These look delicious Jane,
Did you make them yourself?

655
01:23:19,624 --> 01:23:20,645
Yes.

656
01:23:23,086 --> 01:23:29,795
When you say cocks, are any of them...
are any of them... are they -

657
01:23:33,343 --> 01:23:34,558
Big?

658
01:23:35,362 --> 01:23:35,862
Yes.

659
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:39,470
Well, sometimes..

660
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:44,418
Every now and then, you do get one.

661
01:23:47,076 --> 01:23:50,734
That's, well, I'm talking...

662
01:23:58,905 --> 01:24:01,624
Penis Elbow.

663
01:24:02,643 --> 01:24:04,849
Penis Elbow?

664
01:24:05,348 --> 01:24:05,848
Yes.

665
01:24:09,929 --> 01:24:11,001
Well,

666
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:15,461
goodbye.

667
01:24:26,074 --> 01:24:29,738
I was just thinking of Trevor, if he'd
been alive, would you have told him?

668
01:24:32,787 --> 01:24:35,427
No, probably not.

669
01:26:17,545 --> 01:26:19,249
I'm not giving back the money,
it's for Olly.

670
01:26:20,748 --> 01:26:22,327
Stop being so obstinate.

671
01:26:23,473 --> 01:26:26,302
I don't care how she got the money.
She got it that's all that matters.

672
01:26:26,337 --> 01:26:27,469
To you, maybe.

673
01:26:27,874 --> 01:26:29,535
Stop being so fucking sanctimonious.

674
01:26:30,803 --> 01:26:32,204
Thomas! Thomas!

675
01:26:32,427 --> 01:26:33,749
Look we all boast about what
we would do for our kid,

676
01:26:33,784 --> 01:26:36,725
how precious they are,
how we would die for them.

677
01:26:37,017 --> 01:26:38,914
Well, I've just found out what that means.

678
01:26:39,267 --> 01:26:41,084
God knows there are times
when I could swing for her.

679
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:43,660
But Maggie put herself in the line.
For my son.

680
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:45,457
And I'm grateful.

681
01:27:07,896 --> 01:27:08,792
Thanks.

682
01:27:17,647 --> 01:27:18,820
How is he?

683
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:20,682
He'll come around.

684
01:27:26,984 --> 01:27:29,780
I came here to say, to say -

685
01:27:34,233 --> 01:27:36,152
Thanks, really.

686
01:27:37,328 --> 01:27:42,501
It hasn't been a great deal between us,
I know... What you've done!

687
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,718
We want you to come with us.

688
01:27:51,265 --> 01:27:52,671
But you need the money.

689
01:27:52,906 --> 01:27:54,297
It'll be a bit less.

690
01:27:59,728 --> 01:28:02,301
Tom will come around, I'm sure he will.

691
01:28:13,897 --> 01:28:15,582
Tell me he's gonna be alright.

692
01:28:24,264 --> 01:28:25,186
Please!

693
01:28:26,701 --> 01:28:28,705
Please tell me he's gonna be okay.

694
01:29:11,709 --> 01:29:12,631
Busy.

695
01:29:13,449 --> 01:29:14,787
Merry Christmas, Maggie.

696
01:29:32,109 --> 01:29:33,603
Oh... we are honered.

697
01:29:37,352 --> 01:29:38,984
Packet of Bremmies, please Edith.

698
01:29:40,845 --> 01:29:47,615
By the way, given your new profession
I found, how should I say this,

699
01:29:48,942 --> 01:29:51,304
a more salubrious partner.

700
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:54,146
I know about you and Trevor.

701
01:29:55,336 --> 01:29:56,394
I beg your pardon?

702
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:58,821
Your affair with my husband.

703
01:29:59,049 --> 01:30:00,353
I've known for years.

704
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:02,583
I don't know what you are talking about.

705
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,256
We're not all like you, you know.

706
01:30:05,783 --> 01:30:06,991
I know everything.

707
01:30:07,517 --> 01:30:09,369
Times, dates, places.

708
01:30:10,414 --> 01:30:13,834
I know how much you liked
being spanked.

709
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:18,163
He confessed before he died.

710
01:30:19,272 --> 01:30:20,832
Couldn't take the guilt.

711
01:30:21,116 --> 01:30:26,211
You know Trevor,
weak like his tea.

712
01:30:33,362 --> 01:30:39,740
You know what he is.
I really fancy a package of Fruit & Nuts.

713
01:30:40,547 --> 01:30:42,391
I haven't had one for ages.

714
01:31:01,728 --> 01:31:02,774
Here I am.

715
01:31:06,118 --> 01:31:07,162
Where's Sarah?

716
01:31:08,448 --> 01:31:10,553
The doctor said she stayed with
Olly at the hospital.

717
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:13,646
We are going to follow
the ambulance to the airport.

718
01:31:56,884 --> 01:31:58,340
- Sorry I'm late.
- Where have you been?

719
01:31:58,375 --> 01:31:59,244
Traffic.

720
01:31:59,495 --> 01:32:02,906
Olly, you alright? Have you got everything?
Have you got your books?

721
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,310
I love you, just be -

722
01:32:06,345 --> 01:32:07,671
Come on.

723
01:32:08,421 --> 01:32:09,516
- Okay, come on.

724
01:32:10,487 --> 01:32:11,624
I'm not going.

725
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:13,207
What?

726
01:32:13,672 --> 01:32:15,704
I said I'm not going.

727
01:32:17,063 --> 01:32:18,437
Olly is going to be fine.

728
01:32:19,858 --> 01:32:21,265
You don't need me here for that.

729
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:25,301
In fact you'll be better off
without me.

730
01:32:26,924 --> 01:32:28,818
Why aren't you coming?

731
01:32:35,142 --> 01:32:36,348
I can't tell you now.

732
01:32:36,971 --> 01:32:39,442
Remember? Our secret!

733
01:32:39,477 --> 01:32:40,565
Yes.

734
01:32:41,258 --> 01:32:44,675
And I'll see you when you
get back. When you're well.

735
01:32:55,557 --> 01:32:56,694
Thank you, Maggie.

736
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,138
