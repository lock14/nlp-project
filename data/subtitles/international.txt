2
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:16,072
Listen, I'm from the Bronx,
so you need to keep it simple.

3
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:20,440
Why is the bank buying all this
missile-guidance stuff from Calvini?

4
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,543
I don't get it.

5
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,841
The window will stay closed.

6
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,683
You need to relax.

7
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,052
I'm more comfortable tense.

8
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,283
You came to us, remember?

9
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,655
You wanted a way out
and I'm offering you one.

10
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,627
I only met you 30 minutes ago...

11
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:17,326
...and now you expect me just
to walk away from everything I know...

12
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,662
...put my life in your hands.

13
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,833
You want a little more time
to think things through, I get it...

14
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,109
...but we're gonna need
another meet...

15
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,208
...and I'm gonna need to
see some paper.

16
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,815
Yes. Now get out of the car.

17
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,636
<i>- Hey.
- Ella?</i>

18
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,643
<i>- You done?
- Yeah, I just met with him.</i>

19
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,146
<i>- And?
- Oh, he's real.</i>

20
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,545
He's real enough
to blow this thing wide open.

21
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,085
He told me the bank's
buying $200 million worth...

22
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,154
...of missile-guidance systems.

23
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,689
<i>- What do they need those for?
- I don't know.</i>

24
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,326
<i>You gonna see him a second time?</i>

25
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,726
Yeah, yeah. Listen, we're gonna meet
again. He's agreed to bring me paper.

26
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,730
Right, I'll call you later.

27
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,965
Thanks, Elle.

28
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,757
Hey.

29
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,514
Are you experiencing
any blurred or double vision?

30
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,989
No.

31
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,085
Nothing.

32
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,896
Just follow the light, please.

33
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,271
It's been noted that you were
experiencing ringing in your ears.

34
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,697
Yes.

35
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,742
Well, I would like to keep you here
overnight for observation.

36
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,176
That won't be necessary.

37
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,717
Where's my colleague?

38
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,017
Thomas Schumer.

39
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,496
It was definitely a heart attack?

40
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,476
"Acute myocardial infarction. " Yes.

41
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,018
Your penlight, can I use it?

42
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,230
What are you doing?

43
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,500
Can you help me turn him over?

44
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,545
- I'm afraid I can't allow you to...
- Just help me.

45
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,670
We need to contact the Berlin police
and request an immediate autopsy.

46
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,236
Why?

47
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,698
Because I don't think this man
died of natural causes.

48
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,604
Come on, Ella.

49
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,871
If Schumer met this insider
in Berlin...

50
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,743
...odds are this guy's
a foreign national. So it's federal.

51
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,317
But you're not listening to me.
Let them meet again.

52
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,988
The guy's gonna bring paper
and Tommy will close him.

53
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:34,125
You still have to coordinate with
Justice if you want witness protection.

54
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,057
I just tried both their cells again.
Straight to voicemail.

55
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,423
Shit.

56
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,964
I'm gonna try Tommy's wife at work.
If I have to bring DOJ into this...

57
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,035
...they're gonna do what they've
always done with this.

58
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,105
They're gonna stall us with red tape,
informant's gonna bolt...

59
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,707
...and I'm telling you,
he could be the bombshell...

60
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,435
...we've spent the last two years
looking for.

61
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,943
Voicemail.

62
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,549
What's going on?
Why aren't they calling us back?

63
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,653
What do you want me to do?
I can't afford another turf war.

64
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,791
- It's Salinger.
- Finally. Put him on speaker.

65
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,397
Jesus, Lou.
What took you guys so long?

66
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,433
Hello? You there?

67
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,103
<i>Yeah.</i>

68
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,238
So, what's up?

69
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,598
<i>Tommy's dead.</i>

70
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,472
What?

71
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,011
<i>He's dead, Ella.</i>

72
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,914
<i>I need you to get over here
as soon as you can.</i>

73
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,518
Unnaturally red blood,
lambent membranes.

74
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,956
Two key indicators
of hydrocyanic poisoning.

75
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,663
This lesion on the neck...

76
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,391
...is how the poison was introduced
into the bloodstream, percutaneously.

77
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,626
The lesion tested negative
for any poison.

78
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,295
There are any number of reasons
for this discoloration of the blood...

79
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,475
...least likely of which
is hydrocyanic...

80
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,667
I'm telling you, he was murdered.

81
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,487
Well, I'm assuming
you suspect a combination...

82
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,713
...of prussic acid and DMSO...

83
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,116
...but then the reaction time
would have been immediate.

84
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,124
Within one minute.

85
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,093
Which means the killer
would have had to deliver the toxin...

86
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,528
...after Schumer exited the car.

87
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,570
So did you see anything unusual?

88
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,301
Anybody approaching Schumer?

89
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,579
No. I mean...

90
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,683
I don't know.

91
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,421
What is it that makes you so certain
he was assassinated?

92
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,629
Agent Salinger and I have reason
to believe this might be connected...

93
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,066
...to an ongoing investigation
being conducted...

94
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,435
...by both my team at the Manhattan
DA's office and Interpol.

95
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,241
- What investigation?
- I run a group at Interpol...

96
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,902
...that focuses on financial operations
associated with organized crime.

97
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,474
About two years ago, we began
receiving correlated intelligence...

98
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,246
...regarding the illicit activities of
a bank based out of Luxembourg...

99
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,753
...the International Bank
of Business and Credit.

100
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,825
Under the direction of its chairman,
Jonas Skarssen...

101
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,929
...we believe the IBBC has quietly
become the bank of choice...

102
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,998
...for monies associated with
organized crime, capital flight...

103
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,034
How is any of this related to Schumer
and the New York DA's office?

104
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,603
The IBBC's Manhattan branch...

105
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,798
...is the epicenter of its U.S.
money-laundering operation.

106
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,477
Schumer and I
were working this case together.

107
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,273
Agent Salinger and his department
have been assisting us.

108
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,882
Why weren't we informed
of these details prior to this briefing?

109
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,804
What was Schumer doing
here in Berlin?

110
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,768
I set him up on a blind date
with an IBBC executive...

111
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,970
...who was aware of our investigation
and looking to make a deal.

112
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,342
And the identity of this informant?

113
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,077
We don't know. He took precautions
to keep his identity anonymous.

114
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,181
For the past 12 hours,
I've been trying hard to find him.

115
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,518
I believe that if this man isn't
already dead, he soon will be.

116
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,087
Why?

117
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,860
Because, just like Schumer...

118
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,860
...anyone that's in a position
to move against this bank...

119
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,001
...has either ended up dead
or disappeared.

120
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,967
Agent Salinger,
given your history with this matter...

121
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,335
...I should think
you would be more careful...

122
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,977
...before making
such extreme accusations.

123
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,409
My history?
What are you talking about?

124
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,606
We've reviewed your dossier.

125
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,112
Have you?

126
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,048
Well, that means you know
just about shit.

127
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:06,226
I realize this is a trying time
for you both, but until I'm provided...

128
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,629
...with something more compelling
than unsubstantiated theories...

129
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:14,772
...pursuing the IBBC is simply
not going to happen here in Germany.

130
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,183
Concorde Hotel, please.

131
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,159
What was that back there? What
history was Diemer talking about?

132
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,089
- Don't worry.
- Don't give me that shit.

133
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,025
- What do they know that I don't?
- They don't know anything.

134
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,664
Enough to get a rise out of you.

135
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,529
I'm not getting into it.
You're so curious, read my file.

136
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,866
I should never have let Tommy
walk into this.

137
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,442
You didn't. I approved the meet.

138
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,081
I was across the fucking street, Ella.

139
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,112
I was right there.

140
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,320
I saw him go down.

141
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,185
I didn't see a thing.

142
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,297
We won't let them bury this, Lou.

143
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,310
This canvas appeals to you?

144
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,856
I like the look of agony.

145
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,253
Why?

146
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,697
Because I know it's true.

147
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,598
What am I doing here?

148
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,405
Umberto Calvini is disengaging
from the deal.

149
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:44,348
Your principle would like to bring
you in to troubleshoot the situation.

150
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:49,410
If Calvini refuses to move forward, my
involvement won't make a difference.

151
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,955
Your involvement would allow them
to appeal to Calvini's two sons...

152
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,183
...who are much more open-minded.

153
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,428
You'll find all the details in the file.

154
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,566
I'll contact you
once negotiations are underway.

155
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,791
IBBC executive dies
in freak road accident

156
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,811
Luxembourg high society in shock
at death of Andre Clement

157
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,466
Rene?

158
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,695
What are you doing here so early?

159
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,168
Salinger.

160
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,648
I found the insider.

161
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,649
What?

162
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,660
I found the guy that Schumer
met with in Berlin.

163
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,887
Andre Clement?

164
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,157
The IBBC's senior vice president
of acquisitions.

165
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,200
He was killed in a road accident
just outside Luxembourg...

166
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,638
...approximately nine hours
after Schumer's death.

167
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,540
And this is the gendarmerie's
preliminary accident report.

168
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,976
He arrived in Berlin at 8 a. m...

169
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,715
...on Luxair, Flight 9871
from Luxembourg.

170
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,745
What doesn't track is in his statement,
the IBBC chairman, Jonas Skarssen...

171
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,359
...claims that Clement had been with
him in Luxembourg since 10 a. m...

172
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,258
...which is obviously impossible
if Clement arrived in Berlin at 8 a. m.

173
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,566
Did the gendarmerie say anything
about this inconsistency?

174
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,701
Nothing.

175
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,667
- I haven't told them.
- What?

176
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,501
I wanna go to Luxembourg
and question Skarssen myself.

177
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,643
- No. Absolutely no.
- Viktor, listen to me.

178
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,677
I go to Luxembourg,
Skarssen confirms that statement...

179
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,849
...I catch him in that lie,
I can build...

180
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,678
For chrissake, Lou,
you're not at the Yard anymore.

181
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,548
Interpol is not
in the law-enforcement business.

182
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,721
We deal in intelligence
and facilitation.

183
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,389
Focus on that, work that and pass your
take onto the appropriate authorities.

184
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,688
And then what?

185
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,198
You know we've been circulating
our take since the very beginning.

186
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,563
No one ever does anything,
no one ever can.

187
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,434
Whatever case we have gets lost
in the complexities of international law.

188
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,306
Schumer, Clement...

189
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,107
...this entire fucking wall.

190
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,947
There's nothing that complex
about cold-blooded murder.

191
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,933
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Skarssen.

192
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:34,272
- Your name, please?
- Mr. Salinger? Please follow me.

193
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,711
Mr. Skarssen.

194
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,856
Mr. Skarssen.

195
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,664
Agent Salinger? Please follow me.

196
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,156
Mr. White.

197
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,655
Agent Salinger.
I apologize for the wait.

198
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,831
I'm Martin White,
the IBBC's legal counsel.

199
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,330
This is Commissioner Villon
of the gendarmerie.

200
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,231
I thought it useful for him to join us,
considering the nature of your query.

201
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,030
Please, have a seat.

202
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,938
I think there's
some misunderstanding.

203
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,942
I'm here to speak with Mr. Skarssen.

204
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:19,413
Yes, but as Mr. Skarssen's attorney,
I insisted that I speak with you first.

205
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,252
Mr. White, I had a confirmed meeting
with Mr. Skarssen at 11:00.

206
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,522
If I was gonna meet with you first,
why didn't anybody tell me?

207
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,319
I understand,
and I'm sorry for the confusion...

208
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,588
...but I'm sure I can help
answer your questions.

209
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,562
Now, please, have a seat.

210
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,483
As I'm sure you're aware...

211
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,919
...I have some questions
regarding Andre Clement.

212
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,158
Yes.

213
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,828
It's my understanding
that Mr. Clement was working...

214
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,966
...at Mr. Skarssen's residence
the night he was killed.

215
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,658
The night of the accident, yes.

216
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,137
What time did he arrive
at Skarssen's home that day?

217
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,707
If I recall correctly, around 6 p. m.

218
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,112
- You were there?
- Yes.

219
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,378
And you're certain about this time?

220
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,877
Quite.

221
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,184
I'm confused.

222
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,423
What you're telling me conflicts
with Skarssen's statement...

223
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,789
...in the gendarmerie's
accident report...

224
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,091
...which was that Clement had been
working with him since 10 a. m.

225
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,433
I was present when Mr. Skarssen
gave his statement.

226
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,663
- That is not what he said.
- It is according to this report.

227
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,136
May I?

228
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,988
There is an error
in the preliminary draft.

229
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,187
The time is wrong.

230
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:19,734
The finalized report here
says Clement arrived at 6 p. m.

231
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,341
Clerical errors like this
can happen from time to time.

232
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,010
This is why the gendarmerie
discourages the release...

233
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,408
...of any preliminary documentation
pertaining to open cases.

234
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,078
So is there anything else
we can do for you, Agent Salinger?

235
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:46,586
<i>- Yeah.
- It's me.</i>

236
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,631
<i>I just got the results from
the tox analysis I ran on Schumer.</i>

237
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,827
<i>- And?
- It's inconclusive.</i>

238
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,472
Inconclusive? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

239
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,234
<i>They found trace elements
of cyanide in his blood...</i>

240
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,536
<i>...but the levels
are not nearly high enough...</i>

241
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,180
<i>...to meet their criteria
for poisoning.</i>

242
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,244
<i>Are you there?</i>

243
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,895
Sorry.

244
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,242
I'm sorry.

245
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,539
Are you crazy?

246
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,100
Madame Clement?

247
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,339
It's Eleanor Whitman from the
New York District Attorney's office.

248
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,479
I already left a couple
messages just...

249
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,862
Mrs. Clement,
I'm sorry to keep calling you.

250
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,506
I can only imagine what a difficult time
this must be for you.

251
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,275
But I'm not convinced your
husband's death was an accident.

252
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,008
Look, here's my cell number.

253
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:49,449
001-917-135-6565.

254
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,053
You can call any time...

255
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:55,716
<i>Stop calling me. I have nothing
to say to you. Just leave me alone.</i>

256
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,725
Please. I just need to ask you
a few questions.

257
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,558
<i>I have two children.
They've already lost their father.</i>

258
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,725
<i>- I understand.
- No, you don't.</i>

259
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,564
Are you aware your husband
met with our investigators...

260
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,504
...the day he was killed?

261
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,350
You ever planning to come to bed?

262
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,714
- I heard your voice.
- I'm sorry.

263
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,358
- When'd he come in here?
- An hour ago.

264
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,823
<i>T. rex was in the closet again.</i>

265
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,162
Let me take him back.

266
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,833
Come on, buddy.

267
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,689
Lou?

268
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,361
They knew about
the discrepancy in the report.

269
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,062
They had Skarssen's
statement changed.

270
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,638
How did they know, Viktor?

271
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:25,867
- Come inside.
- No.

272
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,006
Are you insane? It's freezing out.

273
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,680
Come outside.

274
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,442
Stop it!

275
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,589
Lou, wait.

276
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,187
Lou.

277
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,193
Have you lost your mind?

278
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,650
I think we take the dog for a walk.

279
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,010
Get some fresh air.

280
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,391
Who did this?

281
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,932
Who do you think?

282
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,197
From my apartment.

283
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,033
Whitman's got them too.

284
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,975
We need to inform
the secretary general immediately.

285
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,338
You gotta be kidding.

286
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,174
We start setting off alarms,
the opportunity will be lost.

287
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,406
Opportunity?

288
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,208
The last thing Schumer told Ella...

289
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:44,787
...was that Clement was giving him
information on an IBBC arms deal.

290
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,218
Umberto Calvini.

291
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,691
Chairman of Calvini Defense, one
of the largest defense contractors.

292
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,296
And probably
Italy's next prime minister.

293
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,195
This guy standing next to him,
that's our insider.

294
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,263
Andre Clement.

295
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,595
And?

296
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,673
Whitman found out that Clement
was negotiating for the IBBC...

297
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,242
...to purchase a large number
of missile guidance...

298
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,606
...and control systems
from Calvini Defense.

299
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,214
But at the very last minute,
the deal collapsed.

300
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,406
What happened?

301
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,746
We don't know. Whitman's
meeting me in Milan tomorrow.

302
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,889
We're gonna talk to Calvini
and find out.

303
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,057
- Hey.
- Hey.

304
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,294
Eleanor Whitman,
this is Inspector Alberto Cerutti.

305
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,523
- Charmed.
- Nice to meet you.

306
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,099
Please, there's not much time.

307
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,930
Calvini leaves for Turin
immediately after this engagement.

308
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,629
I didn't realize we were meeting
at a political rally.

309
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,435
Best we could do
on such short notice.

310
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,649
Thirtieth floor. I'll be waiting outside.

311
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,725
You need to press the button.

312
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,592
You look awful.

313
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,771
Thanks.

314
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,701
When was the last time
you got any sleep?

315
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,771
Don't know.

316
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,976
When was the last time
you had a healthy meal?

317
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,111
Can't remember.

318
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:06,489
- How about the last time you got laid?
- Why, are you offering?

319
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,751
You need to take better care
of yourself, Lou.

320
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,762
I can't have you crash and burn
like you did two years ago.

321
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,131
Please follow me.

322
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,902
This meeting is strictly off the record.

323
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,405
Mr. Calvini cannot be entangled
in your investigation...

324
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,569
...nor can his participation in this
discussion find its way to the press.

325
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,770
We understand.

326
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,816
Wait here for a moment.

327
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,850
So you read my file.

328
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,483
I made a few calls to London.

329
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,584
You should've told me everything...

330
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,696
...with your IBBC case at the Yard.
You should've told me it's why you left.

331
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,197
What did they tell you?

332
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,127
That you screwed up because
the witness you brought in was a joke.

333
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,171
And when you were forced to
drop him, the case fell apart.

334
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,707
You flipped out, attacked the assistant
commissioner and broke his nose.

335
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,472
My case did not fall apart, it was shut
down, and my witness was rock-solid.

336
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,614
He gave us everything we needed
against the bank...

337
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,117
...and then suddenly, out of nowhere,
my AC forced me to cut him loose.

338
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,051
Three days later,
they all died in a car crash.

339
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,651
- "They"?
- He had a wife and two kids.

340
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,793
Mr. Calvini, we'd like to know
why the IBBC, a bank...

341
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,267
...would be purchasing millions
of dollars worth of missile guidance...

342
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,303
...and control systems
from your company.

343
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,207
The IBBC has purchased
billions of dollars worth...

344
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:39,315
...of Silkworm missiles from
the People's Republic of China...

345
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,645
...which they have presold
to clients in the Middle East...

346
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,412
...contingent upon the missiles...

347
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,250
...being equipped
with VOLCON guidance systems.

348
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,262
My company's one of only two in the
world which produce the VOLCON.

349
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:56,729
- Who's the other?
- Sunay. Ahmet Sunay.

350
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,526
Of Turkish Aerotech?

351
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,105
But why is the bank committing
so much capital and resources...

352
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,502
...to the sale of these missiles?

353
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,836
It's a test.

354
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,713
Small arms
are the only weapons used...

355
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,218
...in 99 percent
of the world's conflicts...

356
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,358
...and no one has the capacity
to manufacture them...

357
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,357
...faster and cheaper than China.

358
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,227
What Skarssen is attempting to do...

359
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,792
...is to make the IBBC
the exclusive broker...

360
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,638
...of Chinese small arms
to the Third World.

361
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,470
And the missile deal
is the gateway transaction.

362
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,607
Yeah, but billions of dollars invested
simply to be a broker?

363
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,475
There can't be much profit for them.

364
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,379
No. This is not about making profit
from weapon sales.

365
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,213
It's about control.

366
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:57,392
Control the flow of weapons,
control the conflict.

367
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,994
No.

368
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,762
No, no. The IBBC is a bank.

369
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,703
Their objective isn't
to control the conflict...

370
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:10,271
...it's to control the debt
that the conflict produces.

371
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:14,243
You see, the real value
of a conflict...

372
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,742
...the true value...

373
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,978
...is in the debt that it creates.

374
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,413
You control the debt...

375
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,346
...you control everything.

376
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,855
You find this upsetting, yes?

377
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,223
But this is the very essence
of the banking industry...

378
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:38,629
...to make us all,
whether we be nations or individuals...

379
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,134
...slaves to debt.

380
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,802
You sound like
you're not very fond of the IBBC.

381
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,875
What happened?

382
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,607
I was fond of Andre Clement.

383
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,283
I trusted him...

384
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,146
...and he was a good friend.

385
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:07,393
Then help us make sure
he didn't die in vain.

386
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,167
Find me after the speech.

387
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,803
We can talk in the car
on my way to the airport.

388
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,453
Umberto Calvini.

389
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,847
Definitely connected to any...

390
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,425
What the hell is going on?

391
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,157
They shot him!

392
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,189
Secure this area
and block all exits, now.

393
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,989
Go!

394
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,093
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

395
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,286
I think so.

396
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,762
Take that left.
Maybe you can cut him off.

397
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,434
Go.

398
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,160
Go!

399
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,694
Turn off the engine...

400
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,273
...and stick your hands
out of the window!

401
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,438
Turn off the engine...

402
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,671
...and stick your hands
out of the window! Now!

403
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:52,629
Our relationship with the Swiss has
become impossible over the past year.

404
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,770
They are discounting
our dollar deposits...

405
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,338
...by 160 basis points below par.

406
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,805
They have doubled the cost
of moving our money.

407
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,740
Well, general, what do you expect?

408
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,777
You've been in the jungle
long enough...

409
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,008
...to know that when the lion kills,
it's the jackal that profits.

410
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,685
Yes.

411
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,185
The IBBC is specifically structured...

412
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,256
...to handle the particular needs
of your type of organization.

413
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,785
We can give you better rates
and terms than other competitors...

414
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,421
...but we can offer you much more:

415
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,288
Weapons...

416
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,235
...intelligence, logistical support...

417
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,837
...everything that
the Revolutionary Freedom Front...

418
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,030
...would need to revive itself.

419
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,436
But in exchange for what?

420
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,136
You must understand,
the RFF has no money.

421
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,113
Money is not this institution's
primary medium of exchange.

422
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,083
What are you proposing exactly?

423
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,696
We believe that, with the right kind
of direction and support...

424
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,992
...the RFF could become a very
influential force in your country.

425
00:43:58,602 --> 00:43:59,830
Perhaps potent enough...

426
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:03,234
...to stage a successful coup
in the coming months.

427
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,571
And if this were possible...

428
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,913
...what does your bank
hope to gain from it?

429
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:18,049
The gratitude and consideration
of a very influential friend.

430
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,486
Excuse me.

431
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,687
Mr. White and Mr. Ehames
asked me to interrupt.

432
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,260
Would you excuse me, general?
I'll be right back.

433
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:43,743
What is it?

434
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:52,486
Approximately 30 minutes ago,
Umberto Calvini was assassinated...

435
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,921
...while giving a speech
at a political rally in Milan.

436
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,887
We've been discussing it.

437
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,767
I think we should wait until
the authorities resolve the matter...

438
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:08,369
...and then approach the sons
to revive negotiations.

439
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,097
How long will this take?

440
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:14,209
I've been assured the investigation
will move swiftly...

441
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:19,512
...but unexpected fallout of an event
like this can always complicate things.

442
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,151
We only have 60 days left
to deliver the worms.

443
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,910
There's no time for complications.

444
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,215
That's a risk you take
with such an ambitious agenda.

445
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,827
I don't foresee any problems.
Had it not been for their father...

446
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:34,020
...Mario and Enzo Calvini
would have made our deal long ago.

447
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,631
Now there's no reason
for them not to move forward.

448
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:41,066
An important man and devoted father
has just been killed.

449
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,708
I suggest that we send a letter
to Calvini's family...

450
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,868
...extending our heartfelt prayers
and condolences for their terrible loss.

451
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,705
I don't know, but I'm okay.

452
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,282
The doctors
checked me out thoroughly.

453
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,919
Kiss Jake for me, will you?

454
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,592
So the shooter was identified
as a member of the Red Brigade.

455
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,494
What about the guy in the car?

456
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,898
Car was stolen. They were unable
to lift prints, fibers or residue...

457
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,335
...or locate any witnesses
who saw him exiting the vehicle.

458
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,600
- So?
- So the carabinieri are announcing...

459
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,675
...that the Red Brigade
was responsible...

460
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,473
...for the assassination
at the press conference tonight.

461
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:26,911
We're not convinced
the Red Brigade's behind this.

462
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,847
Someone could simply be
making it appear as though they are.

463
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,587
This isn't my case...

464
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,759
...and the man in charge
of the investigation is very powerful...

465
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,153
...and a real bastard.

466
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:40,626
All we wanna do
is just look around a little.

467
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,381
- Antonio.
- Alberto.

468
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,220
Just a moment.

469
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,986
They done
the trajectory analysis yet?

470
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,214
Cerutti said no.

471
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,501
If there was a second shooter,
he could've positioned himself here.

472
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,004
The stopwatch they found
in the room...

473
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,235
...it was set on
a one-minute countdown, yes?

474
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,904
Right. Calvini was killed a little
over one minute into his speech.

475
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:16,151
What if this was all synchronized?

476
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,618
Okay...

477
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,122
...let's say I'm the second shooter.

478
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,291
<i>The guy below
doesn't know I'm here...</i>

479
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:31,126
<i>...but I'm positioned
right above his room.</i>

480
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:36,099
<i>I'm armed with a Sauer 200 rifle,
just like he is.</i>

481
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,441
I have a stopwatch set
on a one-minute countdown...

482
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,009
<i>...which I start when Calvini
begins his speech.</i>

483
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,680
The sniper below has been instructed
to do the same...

484
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,543
...because that's when
he's gonna fire his first bullet.

485
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:52,051
If he misses, I'm ready to
follow through with one of my own.

486
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,948
The sniper fires, misses.

487
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,724
<i>Seconds later...</i>

488
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,791
...I take Calvini out with a headshot.

489
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,093
It's a good theory,
but there's one problem.

490
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:05,962
Why?

491
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,006
Two shots were fired
from the window...

492
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,971
<i>...two slugs were recovered...</i>

493
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,474
...and two casings were found
next to the gun...

494
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,240
...ballistics confirming that the casings
came from the gun in the hotel room.

495
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:22,509
<i>So if the kill shot came from
a second shooter here on the roof...</i>

496
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,381
...that'd be a total
of three bullets fired.

497
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,887
How do you explain
the absence of the third bullet?

498
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,290
I can't.

499
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,957
I think I've seen this print before.

500
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,184
Where?

501
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,124
Hanging on the wall of my office.

502
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:26,378
So this was lifted from the scene of the
Stefan Heuss hit in Brussels last year.

503
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,676
A former IMF executive director.

504
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,115
Has he ever seen
a tread pattern like this before?

505
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:43,493
He believes it came from
a custom shoe made for a leg brace.

506
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,725
The braces are typically
made out of steel...

507
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,904
...or alloy,
but the condition of the leg...

508
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,471
...would determine the specific
type of device used.

509
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,904
He says that the prints
are a probable match.

510
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,050
Please get these over to Alan Kovacs
at FBl Impressions right away...

511
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,947
...and make sure
he has my contact numbers.

512
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,582
Thanks.

513
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,320
Ella, if the FBl confirms
that these prints are a match...

514
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,927
...it means the bank's
used the same assassin twice.

515
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:17,799
Which means if we can get him,
we can get the bank.

516
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,631
What was that?

517
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,902
<i>That was Capitano Barillo, the man
in charge of the Calvini investigation.</i>

518
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:05,309
- What did he want?
- My ass on a platter...

519
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,813
...and both of you
on the next flight out of Milan.

520
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,186
Didn't you tell him
what we just found?

521
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,854
I tried.

522
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:15,047
Fuck him.
He can't force us to leave.

523
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,852
He has already spoken
to your superiors.

524
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,188
You have both been ordered home.

525
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,894
Arnie, you can't just sit there...

526
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,192
...and lecture me
about protocol and procedure.

527
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,165
You know what's happening here.

528
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,861
Well, who gives a shit
about jurisdictional provenance?

529
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,268
We just had a major breakthrough.

530
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,343
That's great, Arnie.
You're a real stand-up guy.

531
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,673
This is total bullshit.

532
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:41,182
I wish I could have
been more helpful.

533
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,318
Oh, no, you've been great, Alberto.

534
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,455
I'm gonna do everything I can
to take the heat off you.

535
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,322
Thanks.

536
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,693
Thanks for everything.
Sorry for all the trouble we caused.

537
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,030
What?

538
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,643
His leg brace would be made
of metal, right?

539
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,209
- So?
- So if he left through an airport...

540
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,610
...security would have made him
show it to them.

541
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,462
That's definitely him.

542
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:39,335
- He doesn't look like much.
- I think that's the idea.

543
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,737
Seems to know
where the cameras are.

544
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,914
Look how he always angles his face
just out of our line of sight.

545
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,514
Even if you do find him...

546
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:49,913
...that's not enough evidence to
convict the man without a confession.

547
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,351
If we find him, prosecution will be
irrelevant. He'll be a marked man.

548
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:56,286
He can either die for the bank
or flip for us.

549
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:01,664
I got him. He is traveling under
the name Sherwood, Timothy M.

550
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:05,995
He boarded Flight Alitalia 422,
departing Milan at 6 p. m. yesterday...

551
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:08,636
...and arriving in New York
at JFK at 10 p. m.

552
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,009
What time's the next flight
to New York?

553
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,016
Detectives Hubbard, Ward, Ornelas,
this is Agent Lou Salinger.

554
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,278
- Finally.
- How you doing?

555
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,013
- Let me take that.
- Thanks. So, what do we have?

556
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,350
Well, we got lucky.

557
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:06,161
Some clip shots of him
moving through customs.

558
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,194
That's a good one.

559
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,658
The Sherwood ID he used? It's clean.
All of it attached to a dead address.

560
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,667
Where'd he go
after he cleared customs?

561
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,705
Don't know.
CCTV footage lost him at the curb.

562
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,900
We canvassed all the limousine
and taxicab companies in the city.

563
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:26,014
Airport parking, rental agencies.
Didn't come up with shit.

564
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,275
There's a chance
he might live in the city.

565
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,611
Why is that?

566
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,686
Kovacs from FBl Impressions called.

567
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:37,952
"The footprint was left by a shoe
used for knee-ankle-foot orthosis.

568
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,125
The tread pattern is exclusive
to shoes produced...

569
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,596
...at the Isaacson Orthopedic Institute
here in the city. "

570
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,735
The shoe could have only come
from there.

571
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,097
Do you have a contact person
to run down?

572
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:50,897
We got Dr. Isaacson.

573
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,708
All right. You guys go check it out.
I'm expected at the office.

574
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:56,901
Hubb?

575
00:56:57,113 --> 00:57:00,241
Get ready for the smackdown.
He's gonna come at you hard.

576
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,489
- Who is it?
- N.Y.P.D.

577
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,891
- Dr. Isaacson?
- Yeah.

578
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,194
Detective Ornelas, N.Y.P.D.
This is my partner, Detective Ward.

579
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,634
- We'd like to ask a couple questions.
- Why?

580
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,564
What do you want?
Why are you here?

581
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:02,404
Calm down. We just wanna ask you
a few questions about a patient.

582
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:05,206
Patient? What patient?
Come on, you know what time it is?

583
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:09,047
Listen, I'm sorry. I must go.
I really didn't do anything.

584
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,618
- I'm sorry. Good night.
- Doctor, if we could...

585
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:17,518
Douche bag's pinned out of his mind.
He thinks we're here to bust him.

586
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,826
Dr. Isaacson, please.

587
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:25,296
We have reason to believe your life
is in danger, grave danger.

588
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:29,236
We think one of your patients
is trying to kill you.

589
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,500
Kill me?

590
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:39,079
I'm Agent Salinger with Interpol.
We're assisting in this manhunt.

591
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:42,683
Why would a patient wanna kill me?
I'm an orthopedist.

592
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:46,185
This man's a psychotic. He's already
butchered seven doctors in Europe.

593
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,222
We got some serious evidence
to suggest you may be next.

594
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:50,722
Have you ever seen this man?

595
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,860
No, no. I don't think so.

596
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,626
Does the name Timothy Sherwood
mean anything to you, doctor?

597
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:02,566
No. How do you know
he's a patient of mine?

598
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:03,830
We have his footprint.

599
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,565
Yeah, the shoe was manufactured
by AGM Biomechanics...

600
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:11,110
...exclusively for the Isaacson Institute,
model K-A-F-O 1-2-1.

601
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,077
K- A-F-O 1-2-1?

602
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,376
We started prescribing
that three years ago.

603
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,617
We've used it on hundreds
of our patients.

604
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,880
Well, then we're gonna need
to review all of your files.

605
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:22,583
Right now?

606
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:26,819
Doctor, we need to find this man
before he finds you.

607
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:32,093
- What are you trying to do here, Ella?
- I'm doing my job.

608
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,896
You have any idea of the shitstorm
you've gotten me into?

609
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:37,698
- We're just trying to get to the truth.
- I get it.

610
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:42,209
You need to remember there's what
people wanna hear, wanna believe...

611
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,846
...there's everything else,
then there's the truth.

612
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:48,347
And since when is that okay?
I can't believe you're saying this to me.

613
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:50,610
The truth means responsibility, Arnie.

614
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,789
Exactly, which is why
everyone dreads it.

615
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,522
Look...

616
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:09,199
The IBBC is using one assassin
for all their hits...

617
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:12,437
...and we've tracked him here
to New York.

618
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:16,739
This guy can bury them.

619
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,945
They want me to put a gun
to your head.

620
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:26,150
You don't find this guy,
and I mean quick...

621
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,586
...they're gonna make me
pull the trigger.

622
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:35,797
- Do you want dessert?
- No, thank you.

623
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:37,959
I'd like one.

624
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,895
This is a game that rewards
patience and balance.

625
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:44,596
You must think like a man of action
and act like a man of thought.

626
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:57,814
Gentlemen.

627
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:00,785
<i>Sorry to disturb you at home.
I'm afraid this couldn't wait.</i>

628
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:02,785
Yes?

629
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,187
<i>Salinger was in Milan.</i>

630
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:06,919
<i>Whitman too.</i>

631
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,392
<i>They have the scent.</i>

632
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:12,466
<i>It's only a matter of time
before they find our consultant.</i>

633
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,066
Any recommendations?

634
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:23,302
<i>I strongly advise
against doing anything...</i>

635
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,879
<i>...that would heighten your exposure
right now.</i>

636
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,414
<i>Wilhelm, we've leveraged ourselves
over the edge.</i>

637
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:31,553
<i>If we don't meet the delivery date,
buyers will cancel orders...</i>

638
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:33,085
<i>...our plans will implode...</i>

639
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,655
<i>...and this bank will be left
a bill it cannot pay.</i>

640
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,088
<i>Heightening exposure
is the least of our problems.</i>

641
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:40,558
<i>I agree.
We're about to engage Calvini's sons.</i>

642
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,924
<i>We can't allow anyone
to put our agenda at risk.</i>

643
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:45,430
<i>We must sever all ties
with the consultant.</i>

644
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,796
<i>Consider the mark, gentlemen.</i>

645
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:52,941
<i>Doing this could be
a very messy affair.</i>

646
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,372
<i>Well, then make it one.</i>

647
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:58,172
<i>I don't know why you pay me
to advise on these matters.</i>

648
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:02,249
<i>It is clear that you don't want my
counsel, only my corroboration.</i>

649
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:06,047
<i>Really, Wilhelm. We've had
just about all we can take of you.</i>

650
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:11,215
<i>Yes. I've had about all I can take
of myself.</i>

651
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,459
<i>How would you like us to proceed?</i>

652
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:22,966
Cassian, what does one do when
there's no way out of a situation?

653
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:25,237
If there's no way out...

654
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:29,809
...the best thing is
to find a way further in.

655
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:52,496
- Fucking disgusting, you know that?
- What are you, my mother?

656
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:55,603
No, but I could be your old man
for all you know, asshole.

657
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,274
Hey, doc.

658
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,085
Gabriel Hansen?

659
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:16,383
I don't know.
My associate handled this.

660
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,023
Well, the address
is a post-office box...

661
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:23,422
...and he paid cash
for all of his medical bills.

662
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:28,496
There are no diagnostic photos.
Why?

663
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,269
- I don't know.
- Is there a number?

664
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:38,243
Yeah, 212-157-6421.

665
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,109
It's a dead line.

666
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,524
I'll put a call in to Hubby,
have her run it down.

667
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:56,527
See if we can't get a crack warrant
for the P.O. Box in Jersey.

668
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,629
What do all these GT's
next to the appointment entries mean?

669
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,902
We have a kickback account
with Go Taxi...

670
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,175
...and they indicate when we
use their service for a patient.

671
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,678
<i>Hey. Hubb says you caught a lead.</i>

672
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,819
Yeah, we've got an address.
We're en route.

673
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,612
<i>- What is it?
- Well, it could be him.</i>

674
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,050
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

675
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:24,090
<i>Well, they gotta bring him in now.
This is our last shot.</i>

676
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,851
What do you mean, "our last shot"?

677
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,929
<i>Arnie and I had it out last night,
and our clock's run out.</i>

678
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:33,196
<i>If we don't get this guy right now,
it's over.</i>

679
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,268
Well, it better be him, then.

680
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,550
I'm here. Yeah.

681
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:55,880
I know that.

682
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,889
This is definitely the right address?

683
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:02,087
Checked the log myself. This is where
they dropped him off every time.

684
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,323
Well, he could be anywhere.

685
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,933
- What do you think he was doing?
- Beats the shit out of me.

686
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,198
It's a big, empty lot.

687
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,275
Well, I'm starving. I'm gonna
get something. You want anything?

688
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:16,467
Yeah, a coffee, black.

689
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,045
I'm going back down to
headquarters after this.

690
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,079
Okay, all right.

691
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:29,691
Right, bye.

692
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:31,951
How long do you think
this has been like this?

693
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,992
I don't know, but we need to find out.

694
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,027
The doctor's records say
the last time...

695
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:39,099
...somebody got dropped off here
was five weeks ago.

696
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,569
I mean, there's not even
a temporary office or anything.

697
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,230
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

698
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,754
Son of a bitch.

699
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:11,256
What's the matter?

700
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,129
I just made our perp.
Eleven o'clock, blue overcoat.

701
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,366
- You sure that's him?
- A hundred percent.

702
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,873
- Where did he come from?
- Shit if I know.

703
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,808
I'm at the counter and
I see him rolling past the window.

704
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,379
- Wanna go for the collar?
- No.

705
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:29,210
We tail him, find out where he sleeps,
then take him down.

706
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:32,353
A, B, C. Keep the box tight.

707
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:55,166
<i>- Five-oh-two-six. Designator?
- Samuel Koppler.</i>

708
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:58,200
<i>Message:</i>

709
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,775
<i>Your uncle
wishes to see you immediately.</i>

710
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:03,376
<i>Response?</i>

711
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:08,312
The Guggenheim, fifth floor
of the rotunda, 40 minutes.

712
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,487
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hello.

713
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:57,928
N.Y.P.D. I need to
speak to your security chief.

714
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,533
Okay, one moment.

715
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,194
Rick?

716
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:06,171
How you doing? Detective Ornelas.
I need to be able to clear security.

717
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,808
- Okay.
- Thanks.

718
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,676
We're clear.

719
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:48,514
Directly behind me.

720
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,156
There you go. Thank you.

721
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,205
Who's the old scag
sitting next to him?

722
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:54,610
I don't know, but I saw him at the
bank's headquarters in Luxembourg.

723
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,913
You don't look well today.

724
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,822
We all begin better than we end.

725
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:03,956
What would you prefer your ending
to be like?

726
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:09,096
Oh, more purposeful,
and certainly more climactic.

727
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,190
A finale.

728
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,426
A finale.

729
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:17,163
Circumstances can always
be arranged.

730
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,038
As much as the thought
appeals to me...

731
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:23,905
...I'm afraid your consideration
is needed elsewhere.

732
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,305
- What is this?
- Salinger.

733
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:30,716
The method and manner
is entirely up to you.

734
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:36,118
Your principle would simply like him
to vanish without a trace.

735
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:41,693
- Any other provisions?
- Yes.

736
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:43,194
No mistakes.

737
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:48,332
I'll follow.

738
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:56,841
- Where's Iggy going?
- Following a new lead.

739
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,006
Shit.

740
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:28,574
We gotta go.

741
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:33,306
N.Y.P.D. Lock your hands
behind your head.

742
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,479
Do it now.

743
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,817
They'll never let you bring me in.

744
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,082
Do it, or I'll take you down.

745
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:47,557
- Cuffs.
- On the belt.

746
01:12:58,073 --> 01:12:59,438
There's a guy right up there.

747
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:29,262
- Where'd he...?
- Up there! Up there!

748
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:40,937
Get down!

749
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,621
- God! Oh, my God!
- It's okay.

750
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:53,383
Down there.

751
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,069
Shit.

752
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:26,316
Drop the gun.

753
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:31,360
- If I drop the gun, we'll both die.
- I said, drop the gun!

754
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:35,526
They're here for me but they'll kill
you too. Now help me get this off.

755
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:38,266
I can't breathe.

756
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,959
Stairs.

757
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,910
- Fuck.
- You okay?

758
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:21,515
The ramp is the only way out.

759
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,412
Hey.

760
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,648
Don't you fucking dare.

761
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,906
<i>I'm calling from the dark side.</i>

762
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:41,776
<i>- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- I'm calling from the...</i>

763
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:20,918
Get back.

764
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,004
I told you.

765
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:47,412
What? You told me what?

766
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,851
They'd never let you bring me in.

767
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,002
Fuck, fuck.

768
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,388
<i>Move away from the building.</i>

769
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:35,461
<i>Can everybody please
move away from the building?</i>

770
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:56,017
They know you're coming.
We gotta hurry.

771
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:59,551
- Where'd they find him?
- Sitting on a bench near the reservoir.

772
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:03,316
- Has he said anything yet?
- Nothing. He's pretty shaken up.

773
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:07,325
- Who else knows he's here?
- Everyone. Nothing I could do.

774
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,929
Heavies from the Bureau
and Justice are on their way.

775
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:11,826
<i>...with an unidentified third man.</i>

776
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,763
- How long do I have?
- Five, 10 minutes, max.

777
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,495
<i>...wanted for questioning
in an ongoing investigation.</i>

778
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:23,108
<i>Now, a Guggenheim employee tells me
that while they were in the museum...</i>

779
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:01,509
This isn't over.

780
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,228
Are you sure about this?

781
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,131
Just read it.

782
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,582
- They recognize you?
- Don't think so.

783
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:52,033
Back it up!

784
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,668
<i>- ... screens came crashing down.
- How you doing?</i>

785
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:39,210
<i>- There was glass everywhere.
- As compared to what?</i>

786
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,245
<i>And just on the ground.</i>

787
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:44,179
<i>When you heard all of this
commotion, did you think...?</i>

788
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:46,353
Anything you need, Ellie,
just let me know.

789
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,579
<i>- Thanks.
- I just heard gunshots.</i>

790
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:50,917
<i>And people were hit
and screaming...</i>

791
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,356
<i>...and people just started running
out the door...</i>

792
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:55,290
<i>...and I didn't know
what was going on.</i>

793
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,486
You okay?

794
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:58,789
Yeah.

795
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:02,761
You flip this guy.

796
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:06,173
You make sure my partner
wasn't killed for nothing.

797
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:10,105
<i>I know that... I think random people
were going down and...</i>

798
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:14,839
<i>I mean, there was police running up
as other people were going down.</i>

799
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:28,886
You ready for this?

800
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:08,058
Good evening, Colonel Wexler.

801
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,499
I'm Agent Louis Salinger.

802
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:15,469
I know who you are.

803
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:19,438
Of course you do.

804
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:23,815
I was at the Guggenheim
this afternoon.

805
01:25:26,054 --> 01:25:27,646
<i>The assassin you met with...</i>

806
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:31,417
<i>...I know you were his handler.</i>

807
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,789
I know you arranged for him
to be killed at the behest of the bank...

808
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:37,191
...because I was obviously
getting too close.

809
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:43,198
But if a hit team at the Guggenheim
is what happens...

810
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:46,202
...because I was
getting too close to him...

811
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:52,473
...what do you think the bank'll do
when it realizes how close I am to you?

812
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:57,242
Death comes for us all,
Agent Salinger.

813
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:00,045
But based on everything
I've read about you...

814
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:01,950
...you seem like the kind of man...

815
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:05,058
...who aspired to die
for something more than this.

816
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:11,355
Well, this is the difference
between truth and fiction.

817
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,964
Fiction has to make sense.

818
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,639
I'm confused, colonel.

819
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,005
Why would a tried
and true communist...

820
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:28,480
...a hardliner that spent 30 years
in the Stasi...

821
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,844
...fighting against the evils
of capitalism...

822
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:34,716
Why would this man waste his
final days working for an institution...

823
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:38,086
...that was the very embodiment
of everything he once despised?

824
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:43,996
You dedicated your life
to the communist ideal.

825
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,801
You sacrificed everything
for the good of the party.

826
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:52,670
For what?

827
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:59,039
You lost your wife to betrayal...

828
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,172
...your daughter to suicide...

829
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:06,782
...and when the Wall fell,
your whole life fell apart with it.

830
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:09,352
You know nothing about me.

831
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:12,791
I was lost long before the Wall fell.

832
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:18,727
I was once destined to become
a man much like yourself.

833
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:20,964
True-hearted...

834
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:23,270
...determined...

835
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:25,439
...full of purpose.

836
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:28,341
But...

837
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:31,540
...character is easier kept
than recovered.

838
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,648
We cannot control
the things life does to us.

839
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:41,254
They are done before you know it,
and once they are done...

840
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:44,818
...they make you do other things...

841
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:48,623
...until at last,
everything comes between you...

842
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:52,155
...and the man you wanted to be.

843
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,569
No.

844
01:27:57,505 --> 01:28:00,668
We all have choices in life.
You made yours.

845
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:09,879
Sometimes a man
can meet his destiny...

846
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:11,915
...on the road he took to avoid it.

847
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:17,886
Skarssen and that bank need to
answer for what they've done.

848
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:20,060
They have to be brought to justice.

849
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:22,195
You can help me do that.

850
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:24,327
Justice...

851
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:27,100
...is not possible.

852
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:29,236
Why not?

853
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:32,195
Because, Agent Salinger...

854
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:36,343
...your idea of justice is an illusion.

855
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:39,636
<i>Understand the very system
that you serve and protect...</i>

856
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:43,374
<i>...will never allow anything to happen
to Skarssen or the bank.</i>

857
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,543
On the contrary.

858
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:50,014
The system guarantees
the IBBC's safety...

859
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:53,689
...because everyone is involved.

860
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:56,429
What do you mean, "everyone"?

861
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:00,700
Hezbollah.

862
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:03,169
CIA.

863
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,366
The Columbian drug cartels.

864
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:07,934
Russian organized crime.

865
01:29:08,142 --> 01:29:11,578
Governments of Iran, Germany,
China, your government.

866
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:14,873
Every multinational corporation,
every one.

867
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:19,616
They all need banks like the IBBC...

868
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:24,690
...so that they can operate
within the black and gray latitudes.

869
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:27,118
And this is why
your investigative efforts...

870
01:29:27,328 --> 01:29:30,889
...have either been ignored
or undermined...

871
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:34,227
...and why you and I
will be quietly disposed of...

872
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:40,264
...before any case against the bank
ever reaches a court of law.

873
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,439
<i>So, what are we all
supposed to do?</i>

874
01:29:51,786 --> 01:29:54,050
We just supposed to give up...

875
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:57,119
...and accept that
this is the way of the world?

876
01:30:01,596 --> 01:30:03,359
I'm not gonna do that.

877
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:07,962
I still believe... I know...

878
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:11,570
...that there has to be a way
to bring down this bank...

879
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:14,572
...and you are gonna help me.

880
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:23,877
You understand...

881
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:28,984
...if you really want to
stop the IBBC...

882
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:34,889
...you won't be able to do it within the
boundaries of your system of justice.

883
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:37,896
You will have to go outside.

884
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:40,224
Once you do...

885
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:45,395
...there will always be
collateral damage.

886
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:51,873
<i>Yes.</i>

887
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:57,350
<i>Should you sacrifice your own ideals
for the greater good?</i>

888
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:02,319
That's a difficult choice,
one I understand all too well...

889
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:05,487
...but as you so eloquently put it...

890
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:09,260
...sometimes a man
can meet his destiny...

891
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:12,865
...on the road he took to avoid it.

892
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:25,871
What?

893
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,308
What are you doing?

894
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:29,849
I think it's time for you to leave.

895
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:35,217
- Leave? What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

896
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:40,590
No way, Lou.

897
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:43,662
No fucking way.
You've already got him turned.

898
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:47,266
Now go back in there
and get him to come in on his own.

899
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:50,828
We can use everything.
We'll blow this whole thing wide open.

900
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:53,336
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

901
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:55,532
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

902
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:59,304
- I can protect him, Lou.
- No, you can't. They'll get to him.

903
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,072
If they can't, they'll get to you.

904
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:03,682
If they can't get to you,
they'll get to your family.

905
01:32:16,397 --> 01:32:18,558
I can't just walk away from this.

906
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:22,665
You're walking away
so I don't have to.

907
01:32:31,612 --> 01:32:33,045
How can you trust him?

908
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:36,642
That relic in there
is looking for redemption.

909
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:38,876
I'm the only one
who can give it to him.

910
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:42,787
Then who gives it to you
when this is all over?

911
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:46,551
You need to cut me loose.

912
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:51,893
Tell them I escaped from custody,
whatever you have to.

913
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:54,090
Just use my history.
They'll believe you.

914
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:56,566
- I don't know.
- Ella, listen to me.

915
01:32:58,439 --> 01:32:59,804
Sometimes the hardest thing...

916
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:02,999
...is to know which bridge to cross
and which to burn.

917
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:09,610
I'm the one you burn.

918
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:11,269
We've been waiting here
for an hour.

919
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:15,279
I'm sorry, Martin, but none of us
have been able to reach them.

920
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:20,344
Unfortunately, Mario and Enzo Calvini
are not known for their punctuality.

921
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:22,385
They do realize this is the closing?

922
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,510
Mr. White...

923
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:50,172
...I've been instructed to escort you
and your associates from the building.

924
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:52,443
Please gather your materials
and come with me.

925
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:56,180
- Instructed by whom?
- Please, if you could just comply.

926
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:21,040
Our father
never trusted these people.

927
01:35:22,683 --> 01:35:25,811
Thank you for telling us the truth.

928
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:31,254
Had you not come forward...

929
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:33,859
...we would have made
a terrible mistake today.

930
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:36,723
I'm just glad I could be of service.

931
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:46,733
I don't know, Jonas. I was told nothing.
I was simply thrown out.

932
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:48,971
<i>They know.</i>

933
01:35:55,449 --> 01:35:59,749
Look, I can't discuss this right now.
I'll call you when I'm in the air.

934
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:27,837
<i>Welcome to World News.
I'm Tristana Moore.</i>

935
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:31,449
<i>We're live today in the
Democratic Republic of Niberia.</i>

936
01:36:31,652 --> 01:36:34,678
<i>As we go on air, we're getting reports
that thousands of troops...</i>

937
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:38,518
<i>...loyal to General Charles Motomba's
Revolutionary Freedom Front...</i>

938
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:41,286
<i>...are moving towards
the capital of Denue.</i>

939
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:44,430
<i>According to eyewitnesses,
several explosions have been heard...</i>

940
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:48,625
<i>...and there've been heavy outbreaks
of gunfire in many parts of the city.</i>

941
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:51,498
<i>The people of Niberia
have suffered greatly.</i>

942
01:36:51,705 --> 01:36:55,141
<i>It is time to begin a new chapter
in our country's history.</i>

943
01:36:55,342 --> 01:36:58,209
<i>We will not stop
until national liberation...</i>

944
01:36:58,412 --> 01:37:00,880
<i>...and the restoration of nationhood...</i>

945
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:06,710
News about Martin?

946
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:10,179
He didn't show up at his hotel
or at the airport.

947
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:14,953
The Italian police have been unable
to locate his car or driver.

948
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:18,825
I think Enzo and Mario Calvini
are sending us a message.

949
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:21,399
How could they possibly
have found out?

950
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:27,697
This is precisely
what we pay you to know.

951
01:37:27,908 --> 01:37:29,398
We're out of time and options.

952
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:33,712
- We must make the deal with Sunay.
- How can we trust this man?

953
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:37,042
The Israeli government
is his biggest customer.

954
01:37:37,251 --> 01:37:38,343
Why would he agree...

955
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:42,113
...to help us provide missiles
to the Iranians and the Syrians...

956
01:37:42,323 --> 01:37:45,053
...that have a first-strike capability
against the Israelis?

957
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:47,727
I know Sunay.
I believe he has every intention...

958
01:37:47,928 --> 01:37:49,759
...of selling you
the guidance systems...

959
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:52,358
...because he's already provided
the Israelis...

960
01:37:52,566 --> 01:37:55,399
...with the countermeasures
to defeat them.

961
01:37:57,304 --> 01:38:00,102
Would the Turk really play
such a dangerous game?

962
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:03,236
We are.

963
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:06,642
The only way we can make this work...

964
01:38:06,847 --> 01:38:07,836
...is to guarantee...

965
01:38:08,048 --> 01:38:10,778
...that Sunay keeps this information
in complete confidence.

966
01:38:10,985 --> 01:38:14,921
If our buyers find out the missiles are
worthless, they'll pull all their orders...

967
01:38:15,122 --> 01:38:17,454
...and this bank will be left insolvent.

968
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:19,892
Have him here
by tomorrow afternoon.

969
01:38:20,094 --> 01:38:23,325
Tomorrow he's going to
a funeral service for his cousin.

970
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:25,395
He'll be unavailable till Monday.

971
01:38:26,033 --> 01:38:29,127
Unless of course,
you'd be willing to attend.

972
01:38:30,604 --> 01:38:32,401
Make the call.

973
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:37,173
Get me Ahmet Sunay.

974
01:38:43,984 --> 01:38:45,952
It's tomorrow.

975
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,721
It's right there.
Do you want to be escorted?

976
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:31,363
We'll be fine, thank you.

977
01:39:37,338 --> 01:39:38,771
The Sunay funeral, please.

978
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,271
It will be over soon.
You may wait here.

979
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:45,468
- Is there a bathroom I could use?
- Just over there.

980
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:48,614
- I won't be a moment.
- Right.

981
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:57,283
- The signal?
- Good.

982
01:39:57,491 --> 01:39:58,856
<i>The Sunay funeral, please.</i>

983
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:03,020
- Where'd you put the spike?
- Inside the lapel of his jacket.

984
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:05,289
The lawyer?

985
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:08,058
White?

986
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:09,326
He's gone.

987
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:14,939
I told you, there will always
be collateral damage...

988
01:40:15,142 --> 01:40:17,406
...when you take matters
into your own hands.

989
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:20,871
Your plan is working.

990
01:40:21,815 --> 01:40:24,045
It has left Skarssen
with only one option.

991
01:40:24,251 --> 01:40:27,948
Record the conversation
and you'll gain your end.

992
01:40:30,124 --> 01:40:33,651
Sure they'll talk about Sunay's deal
with Israel and the countermeasures?

993
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,192
It is the key issue.

994
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:37,330
Once you let the Iranians
and Syrians...

995
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:42,093
...hear that the missiles are completely
useless against the Israelis...

996
01:40:42,603 --> 01:40:48,439
...they will cancel their orders
and the IBBC will collapse.

997
01:40:57,117 --> 01:40:59,210
- Wilhelm.
- Ahmet.

998
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,017
It's been a long time.

999
01:41:01,388 --> 01:41:02,377
<i>Yes.</i>

1000
01:41:02,589 --> 01:41:04,454
<i>My sympathies for the loss
of your cousin.</i>

1001
01:41:04,658 --> 01:41:05,886
Thank you.

1002
01:41:06,093 --> 01:41:08,687
Jonas Skarssen, Ahmet Sunay.

1003
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:13,060
If you'd simply come to me in the
beginning, it would have been better.

1004
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,700
<i>Midday prayers will begin soon.</i>

1005
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:20,430
Should take a short time
to settle on the broad strokes.

1006
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:22,506
<i>The rest can be sorted out
at your leisure.</i>

1007
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:23,698
<i>We have 10 minutes.</i>

1008
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:39,156
Wilhelm, would you mind
if I spoke to Mr. Sunay alone?

1009
01:41:44,398 --> 01:41:48,027
I believe I understand
the particulars of your situation.

1010
01:41:48,235 --> 01:41:51,068
<i>Perhaps we should discuss this
in a more private place.</i>

1011
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:52,932
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

1012
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,968
<i>Allow me to show you something
very special.</i>

1013
01:41:56,176 --> 01:41:59,942
<i>Something that very few outsiders
know exists.</i>

1014
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:06,147
<i>It's my understanding that the product
you purchased are the XW-41 s.</i>

1015
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:07,644
After you.

1016
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:10,187
<i>Yes. Forty-two hundred units.</i>

1017
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:15,292
What kind of guidance
are they currently equipped...?

1018
01:42:20,534 --> 01:42:23,526
<i>They all need to be upgraded
with VOLCON systems.</i>

1019
01:42:24,338 --> 01:42:25,999
<i>Launch platforms?</i>

1020
01:42:26,206 --> 01:42:28,766
<i>Ground-based vehicles
and fixed-wing aircraft.</i>

1021
01:42:39,219 --> 01:42:41,779
So you understand
I have a terminal deadline.

1022
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,786
First of February, yes.

1023
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:45,891
<i>- Can you meet it?
- To be sure.</i>

1024
01:42:46,093 --> 01:42:49,688
<i>But you must arrange for the
end-user certificates, transport...</i>

1025
01:42:49,897 --> 01:42:51,421
<i>We'll arrange for it all.</i>

1026
01:42:51,632 --> 01:42:53,065
<i>Where would the work be done?</i>

1027
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:56,134
<i>Cyprus. I've a facility there.</i>

1028
01:42:57,571 --> 01:43:01,132
<i>We would start retrofitting the worms
within a day of their arrival.</i>

1029
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:04,401
<i>So if you deliver them to me
within the next two weeks...</i>

1030
01:43:04,611 --> 01:43:06,545
<i>...we'll meet your deadline.</i>

1031
01:43:19,126 --> 01:43:22,391
I'm concerned that we limit any and all
knowledge of your involvement.

1032
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:26,497
<i>If we structure my involvement
through a thick veil of shells...</i>

1033
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,669
<i>...I don't foresee any complications.</i>

1034
01:43:31,104 --> 01:43:33,834
- Sorry?
- You. Come here now.

1035
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:37,067
<i>Usually we would involve
our import partners from Russia.</i>

1036
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:38,944
What? I'm just a tourist.

1037
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:41,740
- Now, you must leave.
- Could you get that light out of...?

1038
01:43:41,949 --> 01:43:44,577
Get your fucking...

1039
01:43:46,753 --> 01:43:50,245
So, shall we discuss numbers?

1040
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:52,386
There is a more salient deal point...

1041
01:43:52,593 --> 01:43:55,391
...that needs to be resolved
before we can do that.

1042
01:43:55,596 --> 01:43:57,393
<i>And what point is that?</i>

1043
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:00,628
<i>The point of fidelity.</i>

1044
01:44:07,808 --> 01:44:09,833
I know you provided
the Israeli government...

1045
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:12,978
...with the countermeasures
to this guidance system.

1046
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:23,147
Last year alone...

1047
01:44:23,357 --> 01:44:26,918
...I did more than 300 million
in business with the Israelis.

1048
01:44:30,631 --> 01:44:32,929
I would never put that at risk.

1049
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:37,331
How can I trust you not to divulge
this information to anyone else?

1050
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:40,830
It's mutual interest, not trust...

1051
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:43,903
...that will be the bond
of our relationship.

1052
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:50,514
Your compensation will be held
in an escrow account.

1053
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:53,947
<i>...released until our clients pay
in full.</i>

1054
01:44:54,655 --> 01:44:55,986
And those are the terms.

1055
01:44:58,759 --> 01:45:00,386
<i>The payout structure...</i>

1056
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:05,094
<i>The transfers will be begun
by tomorrow morning.</i>

1057
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:08,791
<i>Ehames will contact you with
the number for the escrow account.</i>

1058
01:45:14,107 --> 01:45:17,099
So ends the bloody business
of the day.

1059
01:45:29,956 --> 01:45:32,322
We're closed. I need you and Ehames
here tomorrow...

1060
01:45:32,526 --> 01:45:35,086
...to work out all the details
with Sunay's people.

1061
01:45:35,495 --> 01:45:38,225
Yes. We're on our way home.

1062
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:47,062
Wilhelm?

1063
01:45:50,077 --> 01:45:51,476
Wake up.

1064
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:53,515
Who are you?

1065
01:48:55,762 --> 01:48:57,525
I'm Louis Salinger.

1066
01:49:07,507 --> 01:49:10,203
You don't have the authority
to arrest me.

1067
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:15,175
Who said anything
about arresting you?

1068
01:49:19,519 --> 01:49:23,250
- What do you want?
- I want some fucking justice.

1069
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:27,153
Wait, wait. Wait.
Executing me won't change anything.

1070
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,851
There will be 100 other bankers
to take my place.

1071
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:33,055
Everything will continue.

1072
01:49:33,266 --> 01:49:39,205
The only thing you'll succeed in doing
is to satisfy your own blood lust.

1073
01:49:44,144 --> 01:49:45,577
And you know it.

1074
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:42,861
With compliments of Enzo
and Mario Calvini.

1075
01:50:58,018 --> 01:50:59,485
Thank you.

1076
01:50:59,686 --> 01:51:05,686
