2
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:35,723
Sometimes, loneliness can stalk a person

3
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:40,953
like a ghost, always reminding us
of what we had,

4
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:45,763
and what we lost and what
we can never have again.

5
00:00:45,764 --> 00:00:49,703
It can take a person's hope,
hide it away somewhere,

6
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:51,543
where it can never be found.

7
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:54,894
That's... that's what loneliness can do.

8
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:28,694
Great.

9
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:31,813
Alyssa.

10
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:32,943
Yeah.

11
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,883
I'm going out tonight.

12
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:37,553
Order whatever you want, fries, sushi,

13
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:39,194
vampire blood.

14
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:40,703
Pizza boy's hot.

15
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,364
Not on the menu.

16
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:43,933
So who's the lucky guy tonight?

17
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,593
Buff Bill, Slim Jim?

18
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:48,513
Neither one.

19
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:49,514
Have fun, Grandma.

20
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:55,503
Do not call me that!

21
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,563
Do you smell that?

22
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:19,974
- Yeah.
- Again.

23
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:29,234
Alyssa, that's crazy.

24
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:30,344
So?

25
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,344
So, if you get caught
again, you're done.

26
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:36,214
Come on.

27
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,593
We've only got like, 30 seconds.

28
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,164
It's OK.

29
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:40,874
You guys go.

30
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:44,135
It's your funeral.

31
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:14,134
So, uh, Alyssa, you scored
in the 95th percentile

32
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:19,843
on the CAT 6, Science, and in
the 93rd percentile in English.

33
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,104
You are an excellent student when you're

34
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:23,793
actually attending classes.

35
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:26,503
But you know, until you make
up your mind to apply yourself,

36
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:28,573
you're really wasting everybody's time,

37
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:29,693
including your own.

38
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:33,033
Please, she's been through a lot.

39
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:35,853
Her mother passed away
less than a year ago.

40
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:36,923
She's never met her father.

41
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:38,144
Well, you know, the first time when

42
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,623
I heard all that, I was moved.

43
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:41,993
Uh, the second time, less moved.

44
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:44,783
Third time, I don't really care anymore.

45
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:49,543
So, anyway, there is a
packet here with a lot

46
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:50,753
of information in it.

47
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:52,833
And that's going to explain
your options to you.

48
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,413
It's only a suspension
until the expulsion hearing.

49
00:04:55,414 --> 00:05:00,053
Maybe by then, Alyssa will
have, uh, decided to uh,

50
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:05,093
she's, uh... anyway, that's
really all I can do until then.

51
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:38,974
What?

52
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:48,894
You're really starting to creep me out.

53
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:56,793
How much did your mother
tell you about your father?

54
00:05:56,794 --> 00:05:58,853
He was some guy she met
down in the Florida Keys.

55
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:01,984
You know, he's dead.
End of story.

56
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:14,554
That's him?

57
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:21,033
You mean, she had a picture
of him this entire time.

58
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:24,043
They were together for three years.

59
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:26,174
These letters are all from him.

60
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:27,454
She never opened them.

61
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:36,114
They came periodically, over the years.

62
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:40,024
- You mean he's not dead?
- Not technically.

63
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:47,273
You gotta be freaking kidding me.

64
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,273
Your mother was young and in love.

65
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:54,243
She wanted marriage and
children, and he didn't.

66
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:57,583
She never told him about you.

67
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,463
She thought it was better
to lie than to have

68
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:01,984
you wondering about a
father who wasn't there.

69
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:09,783
Alyssa, she's your mother, my daughter.

70
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:11,493
She did the best she could.

71
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:13,863
Why are you sticking up for her?

72
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:15,403
You knew the whole time too.

73
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:16,703
It wasn't my decision to make.

74
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:17,424
It was hers.

75
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:26,653
You know, uh, I think it's... it's time

76
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,913
you two were introduced.

77
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:32,463
Are you insane?

78
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:34,413
I can't do this alone anymore.

79
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:35,793
It's not fair to either one of us.

80
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:37,443
Not fair?

81
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:40,383
I just found out that I
have a father, and a mother

82
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:42,274
who lied to me my entire life.

83
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:49,643
Alyssa!

84
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:51,513
He studies dolphins in the Bahamas.

85
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:54,983
How bad can that be?

86
00:07:54,984 --> 00:07:56,883
I hate dolphins.

87
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:43,103
Hey.

88
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:50,143
Hey!

89
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:51,423
Decker!

90
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:53,223
What are you doing here, Decker?

91
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:53,993
Get out!

92
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,933
Take your tourists with you.

93
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:56,833
Take it easy, man.

94
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,123
See how much fun they're having?

95
00:08:58,124 --> 00:09:01,893
(INAUDIBLE) You don't own
these dolphins, you know.

96
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:02,603
Hey!

97
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:06,313
Has he told you what kind
of dolphins those are?

98
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:07,013
What?

99
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:11,953
Did he tell you those dolphins
are wild shark dolphins, ma'am?

100
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:13,833
- There's no such thing.
- Oh, yeah?

101
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,253
Yeah, you're completely safe.

102
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,062
Right.

103
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:20,343
Right. Don't
listen to him, yeah?

104
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:21,893
He just joking, man.

105
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,783
You know why they call
them shark dolphins?

106
00:09:24,784 --> 00:09:26,324
Because they swim with the sharks.

107
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:32,923
Stop your crazy foolishness, man!

108
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:35,403
You can't see you're
scaring the tourists, man?

109
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:48,533
Hawk!

110
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:51,473
Hawk!

111
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:52,453
Hawk!

112
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:53,923
Hawk!

113
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:55,673
You son of a...

114
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:59,453
You just scared 10 tourists
off the island, nine of whom

115
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:02,323
called the Ministry of
Tourism to complain about you.

116
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:03,022
Yeah.

117
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:06,523
Well, that idiot Decker
was feeding wild dolphins.

118
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,052
He was letting tourists swim with them.

119
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:10,082
That screws with the
dolphins' heads, Coakley.

120
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,413
But you never said a thing
about cornering the market

121
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:14,303
on wild dolphins, James.

122
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:15,803
You have two dolphins.

123
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:17,413
Study them!

124
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:19,313
- Leave the tourists be.
- Yeah.

125
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:22,463
But mine are captive dolphins, Coakley.

126
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:27,213
Look, I've got to
study the wild dolphins

127
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:30,012
so I can compare their sonic
imaging data to the data

128
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,513
of the captive dolphins.

129
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:33,972
That way, when I put the two together,

130
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:36,443
I'm starting to get a clearer
picture of how they communicate

131
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:39,423
for the first time, right?

132
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:46,103
Look, Coakley, when I am done here,

133
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:52,062
I am going to put you and
your little island on the map.

134
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:53,373
There are three partners involved

135
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:55,243
in this venture, Hawker.

136
00:10:55,244 --> 00:10:59,393
You, me, and the town
committee of Smith's Point.

137
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:01,703
- Two of the three aren't happy.
- Come on.

138
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:02,813
That's not fair.

139
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:06,693
You came here promising
jobs, media attention,

140
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:09,473
world-class scientists living here.

141
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:11,393
Now, three years later, all we've got

142
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:14,913
is you, your two dolphins,
and a set of financials data.

143
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:16,453
- Pathetic!
- Oh, come on.

144
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:19,903
Coakley, those are long-term goals.

145
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:21,703
Six months, man.

146
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:24,723
I just need six months.

147
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:28,143
I can give you 24 hours.

148
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:30,833
You're kidding, right?

149
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:32,982
Tomorrow, 3:00 PM.

150
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,653
The board will be there.

151
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:36,992
And you can make your case.

152
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:38,324
And it had better be brilliant.

153
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:43,783
It will be.

154
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:45,244
Trust me.

155
00:11:52,164 --> 00:11:54,244
No.
This one?

156
00:11:58,764 --> 00:11:59,912
No.

157
00:11:59,913 --> 00:12:01,404
All right, all right.
That one.

158
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:06,104
You win again.

159
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:12,343
Hawk!

160
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:14,273
How come I can beat you,
but I can't beat Bogie?

161
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:16,453
- That's cause I let you win.
- You're crazy.

162
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:17,253
You don't let me win.

163
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:18,453
You don't let anybody win.

164
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:20,902
Yeah, especially that Coakley.
OK.

165
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:21,693
Here we go.

166
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:23,892
This is set.
Come on.

167
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:25,903
You've got to do this before
your taxi shift starts.

168
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:32,733
OK.
You sure?

169
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:33,603
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

170
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:34,872
You sure it's recording?

171
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:35,823
Man, relax.

172
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:36,663
I have it, right?

173
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:38,343
- I'm relaxed.
- OK.

174
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:40,243
Spread out!
OK?

175
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:41,193
Ok.

176
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:46,263
October 22, echolocation
communication protocol cc 1-2.

177
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:49,813
I've placed the target
object in the box here.

178
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:52,683
Neither dolphin has seen
the contents of the box.

179
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:55,763
Bacall is isolated in
the far pen, pen two.

180
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:58,082
And Bogie is in the near
pen, the pen with the box.

181
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,892
Bogie is going to come across and check

182
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:01,104
out the target object.

183
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:08,513
Bacall is in pen two.
Here is Bogie.

184
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:11,842
Bogie is checking out with his
echolocation what's in the box.

185
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:16,872
I'll communicate to
Bacall, who is in pen two.

186
00:13:16,873 --> 00:13:21,862
And Bacall has selected a match.

187
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:23,564
Now, let's see what's in the box.

188
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:34,123
Perfect!

189
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:35,193
All right!

190
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,123
Oh!

191
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:39,203
Think that will be enough?

192
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:40,623
Yeah.

193
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:42,643
It demonstrates the principle, and it's

194
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:43,872
got a pretty girl in it.

195
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:44,972
They're gonna love it.

196
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:46,363
What do you think?

197
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:50,123
Good work, guys.

198
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:53,254
Good work, guys.

199
00:14:27,073 --> 00:14:30,042
All that because of
Hurricane Jean last month.

200
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:31,752
Boy, she was mean.

201
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:34,413
You know, people say God is angry at us.

202
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:37,393
But let me tell you, God
don't put nothing more

203
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:40,032
on you than you can bear.

204
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:42,163
How much farther is it to Smith's Point?

205
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:44,223
Oh, just about 20 minutes
up the road, ma'am.

206
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:45,732
But it's going to be busy.

207
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,103
Tonight's Fish Fry Night.

208
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:48,183
Fish Fry Night?

209
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:49,012
What's that?

210
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,423
Well, it started as a
fundraiser after the hurricane.

211
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,792
Every Wednesday, the (INAUDIBLE)
has this Fish Fry Night.

212
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,593
They're gonna spin the potato.

213
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:01,052
We fry it, toast it.

214
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:03,842
Ever had corn fritters, child?

215
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:04,792
No.

216
00:15:04,793 --> 00:15:06,434
Well, you don't know
what you've been missing.

217
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:36,722
Um, do you happen to
know a James Harker?

218
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:39,143
James Harker, I do not know.

219
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:42,992
But Hawk Hawker... well,
that's another story.

220
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:44,313
Everybody knows him.

221
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:46,123
Sure to be at a fish fry tonight.

222
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:49,062
Everybody goes to fish... everybody

223
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:51,193
- comes to the fish fry.
- Oh.

224
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:53,062
All right.
Uh, let us out here.

225
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:54,623
All right, ma'am.

226
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:55,344
Thank you very much.

227
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:02,832
Yes, sir.

228
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,672
God, let's just find a
hotel, hop in a jacuzzi,

229
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,144
and just grab a couple of mai tais.

230
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:13,952
Wait here.

231
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,343
Ok.

232
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:16,393
I'll bring all the bags.

233
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:18,622
And then I'm going to go
and get myself some fish.

234
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:19,702
Ha, ha, ha.

235
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:21,953
You should try it, you know.
It's nice.

236
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,363
Cornelia!

237
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:29,183
(INAUDIBLE) here, please.

238
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:29,953
Thank you.

239
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,062
All for one and none for me.

240
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:43,013
Let's hear it for the turistos!

241
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:49,474
So glad they could make it
to our little island, huh?

242
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:58,872
He's just giving off some steam.

243
00:16:58,873 --> 00:17:00,853
Nothing to worry about, OK?

244
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:15,752
Hey, guys.

245
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:16,582
How are you?

246
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,553
Ok?

247
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:19,493
Good.

248
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:22,403
Having a good time?

249
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:24,343
- Having a good time?
- Yeah.

250
00:17:28,224 --> 00:17:30,133
Cornelia, how do I look?

251
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:31,134
Eh, Cornelia?

252
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:51,513
Sayonara, guys.
Sayonara.

253
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:52,504
Take care.

254
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:15,364
James?

255
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,324
James?

256
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:27,793
Lucy?

257
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:33,693
It's been quite a long time.

258
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:37,593
Yeah.

259
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:48,164
Th... there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

260
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,043
I'd like to introduce you
to my granddaughter, Alyssa.

261
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:05,233
Hi, Alyssa.

262
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:09,193
You two really look quite a bit alike.

263
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:11,673
The... the truth...

264
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:25,423
Are you saying that I have a
dau... well, how'd that happen?

265
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:26,893
It's called sex, dad.

266
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:34,163
Excuse me a second.

267
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:42,374
Well, that went well.

268
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:47,022
You really are his daughter.

269
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:52,802
Is it too late to deny it?

270
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:54,802
I'm Tamika.

271
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:56,802
You should stay with us tonight.

272
00:19:56,803 --> 00:20:01,103
We can talk about this tomorrow
when he's more presentable.

273
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:01,803
Thank you.

274
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,803
We should go.

275
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:13,803
It's a start.

276
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:31,803
Tami.

277
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:38,802
Tami, Tami.

278
00:23:38,803 --> 00:23:43,133
I had the craziest dream last night.

279
00:23:43,134 --> 00:23:44,782
I dreamt I had a daughter.

280
00:23:54,543 --> 00:23:56,492
OK Come on.

281
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:58,442
Come on.

282
00:23:58,443 --> 00:23:59,422
You're OK.

283
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:01,402
You're OK.

284
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:03,512
Come on, guys

285
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:12,333
Let's go.

286
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:17,722
Come on.

287
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:25,272
What were you doing in here?

288
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:27,492
I was just changing
the music on my iPod,

289
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:30,022
and one of the dolphins just
jumped up and grabbed it.

290
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:32,542
They're trained to
react to hand movements.

291
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:35,262
Yeah, well, how the heck
am I supposed to know that?

292
00:24:35,263 --> 00:24:37,362
And where's my iPod?

293
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:41,303
Ok.
Ok.

294
00:24:53,613 --> 00:24:58,532
So, uh, your little jukebox here is DOA.

295
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:02,282
Moron, naked moron.

296
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:13,453
Oh, god.

297
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:21,912
Definitely not a dream.

298
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:24,903
No, definitely not.

299
00:25:36,353 --> 00:25:39,122
Yeah, well, we're fresh out of soy.

300
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:40,252
Black OK?

301
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:43,162
Black's fine, James.

302
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:44,142
Thank you.

303
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,522
I saw Alyssa outside.

304
00:25:45,523 --> 00:25:46,892
What happened?

305
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:49,802
Yeah, well, before we'd,
uh, discuss the young lady,

306
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:51,653
there's something I would
like to talk to you about.

307
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,143
By all means.

308
00:26:03,143 --> 00:26:04,812
Ok.

309
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,732
For the record, I did not
walk out on your daughter.

310
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,482
And I did not know about any kid.

311
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:12,182
Ok?

312
00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:13,772
She left me.

313
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,373
I just want that on the
table, just to start, OK?

314
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:23,772
She died, actually,
in a boating accident,

315
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:24,472
off all things.

316
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:26,532
She drowned.

317
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:28,593
Alyssa was there, saw the whole thing.

318
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:34,462
Oh, I... I didn't know.

319
00:26:34,463 --> 00:26:41,272
I, uh, uh, I'm sorry, Lucy.

320
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:42,643
I... I really am.

321
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:51,702
...Alyssa's been
suspended from school.

322
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:54,312
She has a lot of problems.

323
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:58,523
I came here hoping that
maybe you could help her.

324
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,713
How could I help?

325
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,213
She's your daughter.

326
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:14,332
You... you would need to
find her a good school.

327
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,712
Whoa, Lucy.

328
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:21,402
You can't just sail in
here after all these years

329
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:23,961
and dump some screwed-up,
14-year-old girl

330
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:25,011
on my doorstep.

331
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:26,822
I've done all that I can.

332
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:27,873
She needs a parent.

333
00:27:31,813 --> 00:27:36,822
She's an amazing girl, James,
when you get to know her.

334
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:37,523
Yeah.

335
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:46,633
Great.

336
00:27:49,263 --> 00:27:50,041
Hello, Missy.

337
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:50,982
How are you doing?

338
00:27:54,293 --> 00:27:58,051
You don't seem to be having
much of a day, do you?

339
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:01,011
No.

340
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,783
How's my breakfast?

341
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:05,503
I want to show you something.

342
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:10,543
You just sit there and wait awhile.

343
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:22,902
Look at this.

344
00:28:25,593 --> 00:28:26,293
See?

345
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:35,252
Just... just... hold it.

346
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:36,242
It's coming out!

347
00:28:36,243 --> 00:28:37,292
Yeah, it's all right.
It's OK.

348
00:28:37,293 --> 00:28:38,432
It's OK.
Hold it.

349
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:39,312
Hold it.

350
00:28:39,313 --> 00:28:41,732
Just blow on it hard
enough to tickle him.

351
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:43,912
If you blow too hard, you're
gonna scare him (INAUDIBLE).

352
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:49,782
Now, you see, he's singing to you.

353
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:50,961
Listen.
Listen.

354
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,402
Listen to him.

355
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:53,852
He's singing to you.

356
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:55,312
Yes.
All right.

357
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:56,602
Put it... put it to your ear.

358
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:58,792
He wants to sing to you.

359
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:01,192
Good morning.

360
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:04,632
Oh, my god!

361
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:06,001
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- Oh!

362
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:07,432
- Oh, my god!
- No, no, no.

363
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,612
It's OK.
It's OK.

364
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:09,562
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

365
00:29:09,563 --> 00:29:12,212
Oh.
Ow!

366
00:29:12,213 --> 00:29:14,342
Ah.
I'm sorry.

367
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:17,782
I see you've met my father.

368
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:18,672
I'm sorry, love.

369
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:22,272
You're gonna put some uh,
some spray (INAUDIBLE), OK?

370
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:23,373
So see you... see you in a minute.

371
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,612
You want me to look at that for you?

372
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:30,313
It's fine.

373
00:29:35,163 --> 00:29:36,332
I'm not going to touch it!

374
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,802
I just want to look!

375
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:41,552
We need some alcohol
before this gets infected.

376
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:43,142
Yeah, yeah.
You know.

377
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:44,712
Here you go.
It's only a scratch.

378
00:29:44,713 --> 00:29:46,031
She's gonna be fine.

379
00:29:46,032 --> 00:29:48,512
Thank you.

380
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,992
- I can do this.
- OK.

381
00:29:58,952 --> 00:30:01,851
You know, so far, this
place has been a real riot.

382
00:30:01,852 --> 00:30:03,712
Yeah, well, I'm sorry about the dolphins

383
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:06,001
stealing your little jukebox.

384
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:07,542
It's called an iPod.

385
00:30:07,543 --> 00:30:09,482
You know, if it was me, I
would've thought it was funny.

386
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:11,562
Yeah, well, you didn't have
to babysit for a whole year

387
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:12,523
to get one.

388
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:21,293
So, I hear you're my daughter.

389
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:27,871
I'm sorry.

390
00:30:27,872 --> 00:30:29,021
Let's try that again.

391
00:30:29,022 --> 00:30:30,071
Let's not.

392
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:31,142
Good idea.

393
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:32,572
Are we going to have
to call an ambulance?

394
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:33,961
Oh, no.
She's going to be fine.

395
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:36,192
I believe you two have met.

396
00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:38,392
Yeah.

397
00:30:38,393 --> 00:30:40,422
Tammi's, um...
Tammi's my...

398
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:41,223
Roommate with benefits?

399
00:30:44,002 --> 00:30:44,982
Something like that.

400
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:03,533
What?

401
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:09,971
So, are you sure?

402
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:11,692
About what?

403
00:31:11,693 --> 00:31:14,642
About Alyssa, that she's the only one?

404
00:31:14,643 --> 00:31:17,682
Oh, very funny, very funny.

405
00:31:17,683 --> 00:31:19,162
Look, Tammi...

406
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:21,232
No matter how many times
you said you didn't want any,

407
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:24,702
I always wondered if
one day, we'd have kids.

408
00:31:24,703 --> 00:31:27,841
I just didn't realize if we
did, she'd be half my age.

409
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:30,262
Tammi, this is not something
I planned or expected.

410
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:34,781
All I'm saying is, now that she's here,

411
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:36,382
you're always going to
have another day to work,

412
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:42,302
but you've only got one
daughter and one me.

413
00:31:42,303 --> 00:31:43,752
Just think about that.

414
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:51,192
- So, how do I look?
- Great.

415
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:52,021
That good, huh?

416
00:31:52,022 --> 00:31:53,493
OK, let's go get em!

417
00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:14,322
Ugh.
Fish heads?

418
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:16,342
You mean, you actually cook
those things with their heads

419
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:17,851
on?

420
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,811
How you going to cook
fish without a head?

421
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,222
Hmm?

422
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:22,681
Come on, darling.

423
00:32:22,682 --> 00:32:23,731
Have a bite.

424
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:25,133
- Come on.
- Oh, no thanks.

425
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:38,293
Hey.

426
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:53,232
Hey.

427
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:55,681
Why don't you and Missy go
and get an old man a conch

428
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,001
for supper tonight, hmm?

429
00:32:58,002 --> 00:33:01,232
I heard they're just laying
there, waiting to be taken.

430
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,862
Well, that's what I heard.

431
00:33:09,732 --> 00:33:11,032
You remember what your mother said?

432
00:33:14,503 --> 00:33:15,992
Follow your heart.

433
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:19,463
Mmm?

434
00:33:36,822 --> 00:33:38,212
Alyssa.

435
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:38,991
Yeah.

436
00:33:38,992 --> 00:33:39,841
I'm going for a walk.

437
00:33:39,842 --> 00:33:41,091
You wanna come?

438
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:43,011
Uh, no, I'm good.

439
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:45,062
I'll see you in a while then.

440
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:01,991
Hi.

441
00:34:01,992 --> 00:34:04,001
Hey.

442
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,651
I'm going conching
up at William's Point.

443
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:07,102
Want to come?

444
00:34:07,103 --> 00:34:08,881
What's conching?

445
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,741
How about I show you?

446
00:34:11,742 --> 00:34:14,363
We can stay, finish
that cigarette first.

447
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:32,011
My mother used to bring
me here when I was little.

448
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:33,462
She loved it here.

449
00:34:33,463 --> 00:34:35,582
She liked to watch the tide
coming in over the (INAUDIBLE).

450
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,273
Here.
Hold this.

451
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:51,031
Ew.
What is it, like a giant snail?

452
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:52,571
Exactly.

453
00:35:52,572 --> 00:35:54,642
I saw another one out there.

454
00:36:35,183 --> 00:36:35,882
Got it!

455
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:41,202
Come in.

456
00:36:41,203 --> 00:36:44,621
The water's nice.

457
00:36:44,622 --> 00:36:46,561
I didn't pack a swim suit.

458
00:36:46,562 --> 00:36:50,192
You came to the Bahamas, and
you didn't pack a swimsuit?

459
00:36:50,193 --> 00:36:52,481
- You know who to swim, don't you?
- Yeah.

460
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:55,142
I mean, I can swim, but...

461
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:56,601
That's OK.

462
00:36:56,602 --> 00:36:57,491
I'll do the swimming.

463
00:36:57,492 --> 00:36:59,012
You be the conch sitter.

464
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:42,391
A dolphin!

465
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:43,213
I just saw a dolphin!

466
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:50,821
It just jumped out of
the water right there.

467
00:37:50,822 --> 00:37:54,381
I've never known a dolphin
to come this far in before.

468
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:55,701
Well, I didn't make it up.

469
00:37:55,702 --> 00:37:57,822
He just jumped out of the
water and looked at me.

470
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:03,972
Well, maybe they're just
checking out the new girl.

471
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:07,721
We should go.

472
00:38:07,722 --> 00:38:09,352
We've got a stop to
make on the way home.

473
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:22,501
The experiment establishes
that dolphins can communicate

474
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:24,371
complex, three-dimensional images

475
00:38:24,372 --> 00:38:26,621
to each other via their sonar.

476
00:38:26,622 --> 00:38:29,021
90% of the sounds they
make are at frequencies

477
00:38:29,022 --> 00:38:30,371
that we can't even hear.

478
00:38:30,372 --> 00:38:33,132
Think about the implications of this.

479
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:37,262
It's as if I could email you
a digital image of this cup

480
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:38,741
without the use of a computer.

481
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:39,921
Think about it.

482
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:41,841
We've been looking for words.

483
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:43,051
Dolphin words?

484
00:38:43,052 --> 00:38:44,112
Forget about words.

485
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:48,212
Who needs words when you can
paint images with sounds.

486
00:38:48,213 --> 00:38:51,222
It's a totally alternative
way of communication,

487
00:38:51,223 --> 00:38:54,381
just as complex, maybe even
more complex than our own system

488
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:55,232
of language.

489
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,971
It's a theory, unproven.

490
00:38:57,972 --> 00:39:01,172
Well, if it were proven, we wouldn't

491
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,781
need to test it, right?

492
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:06,361
Well, for starters, this isn't
even a double-blind trial.

493
00:39:06,362 --> 00:39:07,851
You knew what was in that box.

494
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:09,182
Now how do we know that you didn't

495
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:12,081
unconsciously cue the animal?

496
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:14,501
You remember Clever
Hans, the counting horse?

497
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:17,182
I mean, you have heard of Clever Hans.

498
00:39:17,183 --> 00:39:18,921
Yeah, yeah, I remember him.

499
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:20,261
I did not cue the dolphin.

500
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:22,102
Who the hell is she?

501
00:39:22,103 --> 00:39:24,491
I'm sure you've heard
of Elizabeth Glinton.

502
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:25,721
She's worked in senior position...

503
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:26,781
Oh, yes.

504
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,501
I know who she is.

505
00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:30,921
"The dolphin's brain more
closely resembles that

506
00:39:30,922 --> 00:39:32,491
of a hedgehog than a human."

507
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:34,261
That's a direct quote, I believe.

508
00:39:34,262 --> 00:39:35,261
It's from one of her articles.

509
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:36,491
You got something against hedgehogs?

510
00:39:36,492 --> 00:39:40,551
I have something against
the comparison, and you.

511
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:41,491
Oh, my.

512
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:44,701
What's she doing here anyway?

513
00:39:44,702 --> 00:39:46,721
I'm here as a consultant.

514
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:48,621
Consulting about what?

515
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:51,132
The feasibility of expanding
your little facility here

516
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:54,091
to something more economically viable,

517
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,291
to attract, to entertain.

518
00:39:56,292 --> 00:39:57,391
Tourists?

519
00:39:57,392 --> 00:39:58,152
You can't do that!

520
00:39:58,153 --> 00:39:59,941
That's going to ruin my research!

521
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:01,971
Well, James, there's always been

522
00:40:01,972 --> 00:40:03,561
an economic imperative here.

523
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:06,351
I don't think Coakley has
kept that a secret from you.

524
00:40:06,352 --> 00:40:07,861
So why don't you work with me?

525
00:40:07,862 --> 00:40:10,841
I'm sure we can come up with
a way to generate some income

526
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,591
and produce those jobs that
you promised and haven't

527
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:14,492
been able to deliver.

528
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:21,932
Will you excuse me?

529
00:40:28,872 --> 00:40:30,001
Here you go, kid.

530
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:32,391
Maybe your mom can show
you how to use this thing.

531
00:40:32,392 --> 00:40:34,761
Hey, Hawker!

532
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:36,191
What?

533
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:38,901
I just wanted to let you know that um,

534
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:41,571
I'm willing to play nice if you are.

535
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,281
What in the hell does that mean?

536
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:45,671
It means I won't trash
your research if you don't

537
00:40:45,672 --> 00:40:48,081
trash what I'm trying to do.

538
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:48,851
No, thanks.

539
00:40:48,852 --> 00:40:49,551
Oh, come on now.

540
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:50,401
You've had your shot.

541
00:40:50,402 --> 00:40:51,581
Let me have mine.

542
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,921
The hell I will.

543
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:55,251
Come on, lady.

544
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,931
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thank you.

545
00:40:57,932 --> 00:40:59,581
Need directions to the airport?

546
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,991
No, actually.

547
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:05,621
Looks like I'm gonna be here for awhile.

548
00:41:05,622 --> 00:41:06,581
Sayonara.

549
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:10,292
Thank you.

550
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,121
Ooh.

551
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,612
It's a biggie.

552
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:40,751
No thanks.

553
00:41:40,752 --> 00:41:41,681
You take it.

554
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:44,481
This is called (INAUDIBLE).

555
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:46,411
They say (INAUDIBLE).

556
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:48,301
All the days of your life, you know.

557
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:51,861
And this does keep an old
mind young and strong,

558
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:59,761
imagine what it'll do for
me. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

559
00:41:59,762 --> 00:42:02,631
Hmm, I saw this young
lady at the fish fry.

560
00:42:02,632 --> 00:42:05,681
Uh, this is Alyssa, Hawk's daughter.

561
00:42:05,682 --> 00:42:09,061
I wasn't aware our man
Hawk had a daughter.

562
00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:10,531
Yeah, well, neither was he.

563
00:42:10,532 --> 00:42:11,351
Hmm.

564
00:42:11,352 --> 00:42:13,991
Yeah, well, child, you is special.

565
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:16,801
Because you know, it ain't right
for a man his age to be running

566
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:18,711
around without any children, especially

567
00:42:18,712 --> 00:42:21,581
when he have a young lady like
Tami here to keep his bed warm.

568
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:25,271
You is a blessing.

569
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:27,461
I see you've been talking to my daddy.

570
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:31,372
Child, you know us too well.
You?

571
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:35,942
Well, what you waiting for?

572
00:42:49,982 --> 00:42:50,821
All right.

573
00:42:50,822 --> 00:42:54,050
Now she's a real conchy Joe!

574
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:55,531
What's a conchy Joe?

575
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:56,761
It's a white person who is from here

576
00:42:56,762 --> 00:43:01,090
or has been here a long
time, like your dad.

577
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:03,441
Even if you're a girl?

578
00:43:03,442 --> 00:43:06,391
Well, in your case, we
could make you a conchy Jane.

579
00:43:06,392 --> 00:43:07,091
Jane?

580
00:43:09,602 --> 00:43:11,050
Come on.
Eat up.

581
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:13,871
I want to introduce you to someone.

582
00:43:13,872 --> 00:43:14,792
Be careful.

583
00:43:19,882 --> 00:43:20,582
Yummy!

584
00:43:28,282 --> 00:43:30,791
Are all these from the
hurricane last month?

585
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:34,030
Last month and the one before.

586
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:36,601
Seems crazy to live here.

587
00:43:36,602 --> 00:43:38,421
Does it?

588
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:43,020
Well, you guys have earthquakes
and three-way shootings.

589
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:46,491
I reckon every place has got something.

590
00:43:46,492 --> 00:43:47,721
Come on.

591
00:43:47,722 --> 00:43:50,691
I want to show you the
town where I grew up.

592
00:43:50,692 --> 00:43:52,132
Hey.
Hey, dear.

593
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:56,122
Hi.

594
00:43:59,112 --> 00:44:02,611
So, um, this is Smith's Point.

595
00:44:02,612 --> 00:44:03,611
I grew up here.

596
00:44:12,091 --> 00:44:13,091
Hey, (INAUDIBLE).

597
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:00,991
- There we are.
- Thanks.

598
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:05,482
All right then, lady.

599
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,251
Hey, mama.

600
00:45:23,252 --> 00:45:24,592
Brought you some fresh flowers.

601
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:30,860
Just been to our favorite place.

602
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,960
Sure was nice there.

603
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:39,441
Water was clear and warm,
just like it used to be.

604
00:45:39,442 --> 00:45:40,891
Oh, and let me introduce you to someone.

605
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:46,080
This is Alyssa.

606
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:49,562
I think you'd like her even
if she is a little pale.

607
00:45:53,202 --> 00:45:56,611
Has she been gone a long time?

608
00:45:56,612 --> 00:45:57,402
Since I was 10.

609
00:46:00,142 --> 00:46:03,731
My dad sent me to live in England.

610
00:46:03,732 --> 00:46:06,531
I came back.

611
00:46:06,532 --> 00:46:07,802
I missed home.

612
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:15,652
My mom was a swimmer.

613
00:46:19,132 --> 00:46:25,781
I mean, every day, ever since
I could remember, she'd swim.

614
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,602
In the pool, in the ocean.

615
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:33,102
I used to go with her.

616
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:37,821
Said I swim like a fish.

617
00:46:43,881 --> 00:46:47,980
How could someone like that drown?

618
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:48,971
I don't know.

619
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:18,431
They know that they aren't
the only children now,

620
00:47:18,432 --> 00:47:20,421
making them nervous.

621
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:21,860
They want to be wanted.

622
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:23,211
They're fine.

623
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:24,561
Yeah.

624
00:47:24,562 --> 00:47:27,850
What about you, hmm?

625
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:28,900
I'm fine.

626
00:47:28,901 --> 00:47:29,951
All right, honey.

627
00:48:27,711 --> 00:48:31,352
What?

628
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:37,561
I just wanted to see
what you do down here.

629
00:48:37,562 --> 00:48:38,411
Yeah, well, I work.

630
00:48:38,412 --> 00:48:41,291
I work.

631
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:43,840
- Well, that's it?
- Yeah.

632
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:45,421
I listen.

633
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,551
I listen, and they talk.

634
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:51,031
- How?
- OK.

635
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:09,362
Wow.

636
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:17,362
- That's really cool.
- Yeah.

637
00:49:22,302 --> 00:49:24,980
Yeah, it's cool.

638
00:49:24,981 --> 00:49:26,242
OK, that's it.

639
00:49:36,382 --> 00:49:37,620
You don't want me here, do you?

640
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,060
Yeah, well, I'm kinda busy right now.

641
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:39,790
There's lots going on.

642
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:40,850
No.

643
00:49:40,851 --> 00:49:43,482
I mean, you don't want me here with you.

644
00:49:46,412 --> 00:49:47,491
Look.

645
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:49,670
Can... can we talk about this later?

646
00:49:49,671 --> 00:49:51,670
No.
We can't.

647
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:53,090
Well, what do you want me to say?

648
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:54,870
I'm getting used to it, OK?

649
00:49:54,871 --> 00:49:58,391
Actually, actually, it's not bad.

650
00:49:58,392 --> 00:50:01,070
Ok.

651
00:50:02,412 --> 00:50:03,861
I read the letters you wrote to mom.

652
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:12,481
Those letters weren't yours to read.

653
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:15,251
Do you have any idea
what a crappy father

654
00:50:15,252 --> 00:50:16,351
you're turning out to be?

655
00:50:16,352 --> 00:50:17,850
Just give it a little time.

656
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:19,381
Just give it some attention.

657
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:21,070
I am giving it attention.

658
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:22,730
Not half as much as your work.

659
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:24,700
You seem to think this is easy.
It's not!

660
00:50:24,701 --> 00:50:26,840
Yeah, well most fathers figure it out.

661
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:30,541
Yeah, well, I am not most fathers!

662
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:33,040
OK?
I'm not.

663
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:36,291
Look, I cannot be
someone else in 48 hours.

664
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:37,790
Cause you at least have
had a little practice

665
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:38,801
at being a daughter!

666
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:47,600
You know, losing Mom was bad enough.

667
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:52,321
Finding out my consolation
prize is you is proof

668
00:50:52,322 --> 00:50:54,392
positive that God hates me.

669
00:50:58,741 --> 00:50:59,442
Wait.

670
00:51:10,502 --> 00:51:12,281
What are you looking at?

671
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:22,741
Hey?

672
00:51:36,751 --> 00:51:37,452
Alyssa!

673
00:51:42,551 --> 00:51:43,252
She's gone.

674
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:12,970
Come on.

675
00:54:12,971 --> 00:54:14,970
It's all right.

676
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:15,960
It's all right.

677
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:16,960
Come here.

678
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:17,950
It's all right.

679
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:05,281
Fine.

680
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:07,182
Go ahead and leave me
like everybody else!

681
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:55,080
Alyssa!

682
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:57,080
Alyssa!

683
00:55:57,081 --> 00:55:58,580
Alyssa!

684
00:55:58,581 --> 00:55:59,740
Alyssa!

685
00:55:59,741 --> 00:56:00,570
Alyssa!

686
00:56:00,571 --> 00:56:01,471
Alyssa!

687
00:56:03,731 --> 00:56:04,561
Alyssa!

688
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:11,550
Alyssa!

689
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:13,550
Alyssa!

690
00:56:13,551 --> 00:56:15,040
Is that you, girl?

691
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:16,040
Alyssa?

692
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,540
Oh, man.

693
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,540
You got her?

694
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,531
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

695
00:56:23,531 --> 00:56:25,521
Oh, my god.

696
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:39,001
Look at this kid, Danny.

697
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:44,480
Here.
Hold this.

698
00:56:44,481 --> 00:56:45,210
OK, honey.

699
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:46,181
Easy now.

700
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:47,600
Easy.

701
00:56:47,601 --> 00:56:49,350
Come on, baby.

702
00:56:53,461 --> 00:56:54,620
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

703
00:56:54,621 --> 00:56:56,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

704
00:56:56,611 --> 00:56:58,050
- Easy there, kid.
- Watch her head.

705
00:56:58,051 --> 00:56:59,450
- You got her?
- I got her.

706
00:56:59,451 --> 00:57:01,240
Yeah, I got her.

707
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:02,241
Thanks, Danny.

708
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:12,460
Well, I'd say you look
about as bad as I feel.

709
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:14,350
But I'm not sure whether
that would make you any more

710
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:17,251
- receptive to an apology.
- Go away.

711
00:58:25,191 --> 00:58:33,620
Look, I, uh... the thing is
I... fact is, you're right.

712
00:58:33,621 --> 00:58:34,320
I'm rude.

713
00:58:34,321 --> 00:58:35,150
I'm stubborn.

714
00:58:35,151 --> 00:58:37,731
- ...and selfish.
- That too.

715
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,770
Alyssa, I'm sorry.

716
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:44,741
I really am.

717
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:54,690
Look, your mother was
smart enough to realize

718
00:58:54,691 --> 00:58:56,170
what a lousy dad I'd be.

719
00:58:56,171 --> 00:58:57,411
And maybe she was right.

720
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,050
But I loved her, Alyssa.

721
00:59:09,621 --> 00:59:11,111
I loved her a lot.

722
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:21,511
And, uh, I want to love you too.

723
00:59:24,991 --> 00:59:26,501
I just don't know how to yet.

724
00:59:32,971 --> 00:59:36,331
Do you have any idea how
big of a jerk you are?

725
00:59:39,101 --> 00:59:39,801
Huh.

726
00:59:42,901 --> 00:59:43,601
Yeah.

727
00:59:50,221 --> 00:59:50,921
Good.

728
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:57,691
Here.

729
01:00:00,281 --> 01:00:02,480
Put one of those on.

730
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:05,470
It's about time you start
earning your keep around here.

731
01:00:05,471 --> 01:00:06,230
Come in.

732
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:07,631
You're going to help
me walk the dolphins.

733
01:00:14,461 --> 01:00:15,371
Walk the dolphins?

734
01:01:14,181 --> 01:01:15,250
Come on, guys.

735
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:17,250
That's as far as we go.

736
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:20,240
Why don't they just swim away?

737
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:21,740
Well, this is home.

738
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:23,730
They're used to living with us.

739
01:01:23,731 --> 01:01:25,730
They're not wild anymore.

740
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:27,231
We're their family now.

741
01:01:40,201 --> 01:01:41,850
They're really smart, aren't they?

742
01:01:43,151 --> 01:01:44,899
Right.

743
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,180
And I would contest that
these animals are at least

744
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:49,560
as smart as any other human
on the planet... Coakley,

745
01:01:49,561 --> 01:01:51,680
for example.

746
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:53,440
Principal McGowan.

747
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:54,530
Elizabeth Glinton.

748
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:56,460
Trevor Mason.

749
01:01:56,461 --> 01:01:59,899
Who's Trevor Mason?

750
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,850
Nobody important.

751
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:02,830
Oh, yeah?

752
01:02:02,831 --> 01:02:05,850
Oh, I get it.

753
01:02:05,851 --> 01:02:09,420
You pretend to hate him,
but you really like him.

754
01:02:09,421 --> 01:02:12,969
That's how women work, isn't it?

755
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,740
No.

756
01:02:14,741 --> 01:02:17,110
Oh yes, it is.

757
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,710
Hey, guys.

758
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:30,600
Come on. Come on.

759
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:32,240
Let me show you something.

760
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:33,530
Hi, Dan-o.

761
01:02:33,531 --> 01:02:34,889
Hey.

762
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,580
Here we go.

763
01:02:37,581 --> 01:02:38,899
- Coakley called.
- Yeah?

764
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,079
Said he wants to see right away.

765
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,270
Well, isn't that sweet of him?
He must miss me.

766
01:02:42,271 --> 01:02:44,029
Well, you can tell him
he can take a hike.

767
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,909
I'm hanging with my daughter.

768
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:48,820
He said if you don't
come, he's giving you 72

769
01:02:48,821 --> 01:02:50,230
hours to vacate the premises.

770
01:02:50,231 --> 01:02:51,590
What?

771
01:02:51,591 --> 01:02:53,989
That's without Bogey and Bacall.

772
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:56,280
But he can't do that.

773
01:02:56,281 --> 01:02:57,650
I think you better call your attorney.

774
01:02:57,651 --> 01:02:58,680
No, no, no, no.

775
01:02:58,681 --> 01:02:59,959
We don't need an attorney here.

776
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,730
I can do this myself.

777
01:03:00,731 --> 01:03:01,430
Let me do it.

778
01:03:01,431 --> 01:03:02,430
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

779
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:04,690
- Well, can I come?
- No, honey.

780
01:03:04,691 --> 01:03:06,480
I don't think this is a place for kids.

781
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:07,180
What.

782
01:03:07,181 --> 01:03:09,370
You don't think I'll understand?

783
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:10,320
OK, point taken.

784
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:11,570
You can come.

785
01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:12,400
OK, I'll go get dressed.

786
01:03:12,401 --> 01:03:14,560
Yup.

787
01:03:14,561 --> 01:03:15,330
You go.

788
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:16,730
- I'll bring her.
- Yeah?

789
01:03:16,731 --> 01:03:17,730
Yeah.

790
01:03:17,731 --> 01:03:18,430
10 minutes, yeah?

791
01:03:18,431 --> 01:03:20,909
10 minutes.

792
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,760
What's going on?

793
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:34,110
I'm getting our things
together so we can leave.

794
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:35,079
You can't do that to me.

795
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,240
We just got here.

796
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:39,130
It's the same old thing, Alyssa.

797
01:03:39,131 --> 01:03:42,190
Last night, you were
passed out on the beach.

798
01:03:42,191 --> 01:03:43,470
I was mad.

799
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:47,121
It was stupid, OK?
Please?

800
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:51,069
It was your idea.

801
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:54,079
It was a good idea.

802
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,100
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

803
01:03:58,101 --> 01:03:59,510
Just give it a month.

804
01:03:59,511 --> 01:04:02,510
If it doesn't work, I'll know.

805
01:04:02,511 --> 01:04:05,909
I'll come home.

806
01:04:15,641 --> 01:04:16,401
I love you, you know.

807
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,820
I love you, too.

808
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:24,750
I love you, too.

809
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,661
Ok.

810
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:45,450
As you can see, we've
added more pens which

811
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:47,510
means we'll be bringing in more dolphins

812
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:49,200
once the facility is up and running.

813
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:51,699
And we've already purchased six more.

814
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:56,039
Um, we'll be adding
bleachers, a small cafe,

815
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,969
and enough parking for two
tour buses at the same time.

816
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:02,410
How am I supposed to do my
research in a place like this?

817
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:03,111
It's impossible.

818
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:12,460
James, what you're doing
here is junk science.

819
01:05:12,461 --> 01:05:14,290
Junk science?

820
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:15,909
Perhaps I was being too diplomatic.

821
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:18,110
I should've said
third-rate junk science.

822
01:05:18,111 --> 01:05:20,350
And you're dreaming if you think
it's going to have any impact.

823
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:23,360
I am on the verge of
something huge here.

824
01:05:23,361 --> 01:05:27,799
Research here in this
situation is not a luxury

825
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,079
this island can afford.

826
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,470
It's just not on the menu, James.

827
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:34,749
Who is she?

828
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:38,230
This is my daughter.

829
01:05:38,231 --> 01:05:41,649
Elizabeth will be taking over
day-to-day operation effective

830
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,729
immediately.

831
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,049
I will consider your resignation,

832
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:47,889
should you choose to submit it.

833
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:51,779
...What about...
I'm not a damned employee.

834
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,440
I'm... I'm a partner.

835
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:54,649
Yes, you are a partner.

836
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:55,709
And Coakley is a partner.

837
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,009
And the town committee is a partner.

838
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,211
You're a minority partner.

839
01:06:01,171 --> 01:06:04,220
You are not going to do this.

840
01:06:04,221 --> 01:06:04,940
Come on, Alyssa.

841
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:15,370
Dad, wait up.

842
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,849
Dad, Coakley can't speak for
the town of Smith's Point.

843
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,799
Coakley is an elected official.

844
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,380
The town of Smith's Point
has a voice in this, right?

845
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:25,669
Coakley does what he wants.

846
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,079
There has to be a vote.

847
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,581
Tell him you want a vote.

848
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,300
Yeah, you're right.

849
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:35,480
You're absolutely right.

850
01:06:35,481 --> 01:06:36,300
There has to be a vote.

851
01:06:36,301 --> 01:06:37,809
Let's go back in there.

852
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:41,899
Now, these pens will be made
of concrete as opposed to wood.

853
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,560
Will that affect the Dolphins' sonar?

854
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:45,490
No, not at all.

855
01:06:45,491 --> 01:06:46,749
They'll be fine.

856
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,689
Coakley, I want a vote.

857
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:50,110
Oh, come on, Hawk.

858
01:06:50,111 --> 01:06:51,609
No, no, no.
You're a third.

859
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:52,310
I'm a third.

860
01:06:52,311 --> 01:06:53,280
The town's a third.

861
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:56,019
You say you got the town's
committee on your side.

862
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:57,531
Prove it.
I want a vote.

863
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:07,889
Fine, Hawker I'll call a town committee

864
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,599
meeting tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

865
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,250
Good.

866
01:07:12,251 --> 01:07:14,559
I think you're
underestimating this town.

867
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,420
I think you overestimate yourself.

868
01:07:18,421 --> 01:07:21,899
Come on, Alyssa.

869
01:07:51,241 --> 01:07:53,121
I heard you and your
dad had quite a day.

870
01:07:57,501 --> 01:07:59,939
Come on, child.

871
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,400
Come and sit with me.
Come.

872
01:08:01,401 --> 01:08:03,351
Come.
Come.

873
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:11,649
So how do the fish see the bait?

874
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,361
With their nose.

875
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:22,819
He's out there somewhere.

876
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,799
Who?

877
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,790
Your friend.

878
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:35,499
You know, years ago,
everyone around here

879
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,789
was a fisherman, their nets
right along this shore.

880
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:44,779
Then the fish... the dolphin
drove the fish into the nets.

881
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:47,829
When they were finished,
the people shared

882
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:51,300
the catch with the dolphins.

883
01:08:51,301 --> 01:08:53,230
Was that a legend or something?

884
01:08:53,231 --> 01:08:54,679
Uh-huh.

885
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,699
It's happening like that
right now around the village.

886
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:02,599
There's a village in
Brazil, place in Mozambique,

887
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:07,999
and Africa, and other places as well.

888
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,331
But they don't fish like
that around here no more.

889
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,739
Do you think that the
dolphins can really talk?

890
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:18,730
I mean, really talk?

891
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,649
What do you think?

892
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,130
I think they can.

893
01:09:27,131 --> 01:09:30,589
We just don't know how to listen well.

894
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:32,069
There we go.

895
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:36,090
I want to show you something.

896
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:40,940
Have a look at that.

897
01:09:48,221 --> 01:09:49,669
It's an eye.

898
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:52,100
It's a dolphin's eye.

899
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:54,160
My grandfather made it.

900
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:57,110
He was one of the
fishermen I told you about.

901
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:59,869
It's beautiful.

902
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:03,140
He believed that dolphins
can see in ways that we can't,

903
01:10:03,141 --> 01:10:05,809
and that they'll help you if you just

904
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:08,999
open up your heart to them.

905
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,509
You're here!

906
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:34,480
Come here.

907
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:37,960
Come here.

908
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:41,440
Come here.

909
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:55,849
Come here.

910
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,059
You must be a girl.

911
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:00,559
A boy would never play so hard to get.

912
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,549
What's your name?

913
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,540
Can I call you Rasca?

914
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:17,020
Rasca, it is.

915
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,509
Good girl.

916
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:40,979
Oh.

917
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:41,969
You're so beautiful.

918
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:43,469
Look at you.

919
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,959
Oh, little show-off.

920
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,959
Look at you.

921
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,960
You're so pretty.

922
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:52,059
All right, Hawk.

923
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,409
Have something to eat.

924
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:55,349
Yeah, yeah.

925
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:56,150
Later, later.

926
01:13:56,151 --> 01:13:57,779
Boy, worry don't nourish nobody.

927
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:59,639
Man, have something to eat.

928
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,509
All God's children got to eat.

929
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:03,820
Where's my daughter?

930
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:08,899
I saw her up at William's Point.

931
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,379
Who's she with?

932
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,369
A friend.

933
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:13,359
A friend?

934
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,349
Yeah.

935
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:15,339
Girl?

936
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,339
No.

937
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,329
A boy?

938
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:20,299
No.

939
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,809
Ok.

940
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:25,339
I'm going up there.

941
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,299
Hawk!

942
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,279
Good girl.

943
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,760
Yeah.
Oh!

944
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:38,599
Come on.

945
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,579
Go on!

946
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,569
Yeah.

947
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:41,839
Good girl.
Come on.

948
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,540
Come on!

949
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:47,879
Alyssa!

950
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,129
Get out of the water!

951
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:52,059
It's OK, Dad.

952
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:53,919
She's my friend.

953
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,589
It's a wild dolphin, Alyssa.
Get out!

954
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:59,349
Get out of the water.

955
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,340
Rasca!
Rasca!

956
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,960
Alyssa!
Alyssa!

957
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,649
Alyssa, wild dolphins who leave
their pod and seek out humans

958
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,349
are psychologically unstable.

959
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:24,088
They become attached
to their human friends.

960
01:15:24,089 --> 01:15:25,939
They don't want them to leave the water.

961
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,189
They don't want to be alone.

962
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,599
Then they become aggressive,
and somebody gets hurt.

963
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,409
You don't know that!

964
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:31,109
Yes, I do.

965
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,019
This behavior's been
documented 21 times.

966
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,659
Look.
Here's a... I wrote this.

967
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,439
Look, read it.

968
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,949
It's bad for the dolphin, Alyssa.

969
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:39,169
I don't want to read
your stupid articles.

970
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:41,449
She doesn't have anybody but me!

971
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:44,189
Yeah, And that's not right.

972
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:46,469
Look, out there, somewhere in the ocean,

973
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:48,979
right, there's a pod
of dolphins that she

974
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,048
is going to connect with.

975
01:15:50,049 --> 01:15:52,809
But how is she going to do
that if you don't let her go?

976
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:54,859
Why can't she just come
live with Bogie and Bacall?

977
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:56,078
Well, that's just not possible.

978
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:58,239
Bogie and Bacall...
They're happy here.

979
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,269
How would your friend feel
about living in a pen?

980
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:03,129
Why don't you understand?

981
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:04,179
We talk to each other.

982
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:05,639
We understand each other.

983
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,349
You're the one who researches it.

984
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,339
But you just don't understand it?

985
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:11,028
Alyssa, you're going
to have to trust me.

986
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:13,139
Wild dolphins have to stay that way.

987
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:16,649
I forbid you from having any
more contact with that dolphin!

988
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:17,589
You what?

989
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:19,869
Look, I know this is hard
for you to understand.

990
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:23,529
But believe me, I promise you,
someday you will understand it.

991
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:26,029
No!
I will never understand you!

992
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,480
Damn.
Damn.

993
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:47,499
I don't think I can do this.

994
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,400
We can.

995
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:12,750
What do you want?

996
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:19,710
I, uh, wanted to give you this.

997
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:50,639
And so, imagine just

998
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,028
down the street, a magnet
that will draw perhaps

999
01:17:54,029 --> 01:17:57,088
over 1,000 people a week.

1000
01:17:57,089 --> 01:18:00,058
1,000 people that would be
free to roam in the town,

1001
01:18:00,059 --> 01:18:04,369
and buy a nice, cold beer right
here in this establishment.

1002
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:08,928
Or perhaps one of your delicious
Cobb salad, eh, Cornelia?

1003
01:18:08,929 --> 01:18:10,419
Oh they'd be welcome.

1004
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,339
I'd even sell them some of
my famous peas and grits.

1005
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:15,790
Precisely!

1006
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,999
Your turn, Mr. Hawker.

1007
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:38,569
So, now we all think that
our kind of intelligence

1008
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:42,219
is the only kind of
intelligence that exists.

1009
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:45,379
But is it?

1010
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,249
Just because we can
manipulate the environment,

1011
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:51,078
build things... cars, buildings, ships,

1012
01:18:51,079 --> 01:18:53,898
planes... doesn't mean that
that's the only intelligence

1013
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:55,038
that exists, right?

1014
01:18:55,039 --> 01:19:02,048
Now, imagine if we were totally
suited to our environment,

1015
01:19:02,049 --> 01:19:06,469
like dolphins, don't
you think it's possible,

1016
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:10,898
I mean, just possible
that our intelligence

1017
01:19:10,899 --> 01:19:12,629
would have evolved differently?

1018
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:16,119
It would have revealed
itself in a different way?

1019
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:21,519
I mean, they don't need to
build cars or drive them.

1020
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,339
And it's not their lack of intelligence

1021
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,459
that's blocking us.

1022
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,958
It's our lack of imagination
that's stopping us

1023
01:19:28,959 --> 01:19:30,858
from understanding these creatures who

1024
01:19:30,859 --> 01:19:35,189
are as intelligent as
us, if not more so,

1025
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:38,249
judging by what's going on
in this room here today, huh?

1026
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:39,659
You want to know what
the bottom line is?

1027
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:43,779
You don't have to go
to the moon to find ET.

1028
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,689
He's right here living in
the oceans of the earth.

1029
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:50,439
And I am this far away from proving it.

1030
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:56,569
But you would destroy all of
that for a tourist attraction?

1031
01:19:56,570 --> 01:20:00,968
Yeah, yeah, Hawk, but a tourist
show that make real money, man.

1032
01:20:00,969 --> 01:20:03,129
You see, that's real money.

1033
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:04,689
I make all of this today.

1034
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:05,469
No, man.

1035
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:09,018
Yes, all of this from
the tourists who want

1036
01:20:09,019 --> 01:20:10,679
swim with the dolphins.

1037
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,119
- Now you're talking!
- You understand?

1038
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,199
I mean, if they want a dolphin show,

1039
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,639
you give them a dolphin show.

1040
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,519
If they want a dolphin
show, that means we can

1041
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,329
fix the potholes in my roads.

1042
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:21,099
Right, Mr. (INAUDIBLE)?

1043
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:21,878
Now you're talking.

1044
01:20:21,879 --> 01:20:24,058
Hey, and you tell me your
truck broke down the other day

1045
01:20:24,059 --> 01:20:25,028
when you fell in the pothole.

1046
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:25,998
All the time, man, all the time.

1047
01:20:25,999 --> 01:20:27,008
Huh?
I tell you, man.

1048
01:20:27,009 --> 01:20:28,279
And we could buy homes.

1049
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,649
I mean, we could live good!

1050
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:32,078
Huh?

1051
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:33,018
Live good!

1052
01:20:33,019 --> 01:20:35,878
You don't know what you'd be losing.

1053
01:20:35,879 --> 01:20:37,289
You're right, Hawk.

1054
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:38,649
We don't know what we'd be losing.

1055
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:39,649
But, you know what?

1056
01:20:39,650 --> 01:20:41,868
We know what we'll be gaining!
Money!

1057
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:47,439
(INAUDIBLE)

1058
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,359
That's right!

1059
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,339
Money!

1060
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:53,768
We'll be gaining money!

1061
01:20:53,769 --> 01:20:56,008
All those in favor of
approval of the dolphin park,

1062
01:20:56,009 --> 01:20:57,629
- say "aye!".
- Hey, wait a minute!

1063
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,028
- Wait a minute!
- Yeah!

1064
01:20:59,029 --> 01:20:59,928
Yeah!

1065
01:20:59,929 --> 01:21:01,549
Aye, aye, aye.
Come on, let's go.

1066
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:03,139
Yeah, drinks on me!
Come on.

1067
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:04,629
Let's go!
Let's go!

1068
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:10,619
Who wants some drinks?

1069
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,119
Drinks are on the house, everybody.

1070
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,008
Look.

1071
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:54,169
I'd give them everything except
the dolphins and the boat.

1072
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:54,859
Ok?

1073
01:22:57,370 --> 01:23:00,559
According to this, the
dolphins belong to the venture,

1074
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,618
not to you.

1075
01:23:01,619 --> 01:23:02,339
That's bullshit.

1076
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:03,309
They're mine.

1077
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:04,439
I own them.

1078
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,359
There may be a way.

1079
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,838
Yeah?

1080
01:23:07,839 --> 01:23:09,828
Upon dissolution of the partnership,

1081
01:23:09,829 --> 01:23:15,078
you can get the dolphins back,
but only if all debts are paid.

1082
01:23:15,079 --> 01:23:17,369
Are all debts paid?

1083
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:20,069
Nope.

1084
01:23:33,879 --> 01:23:38,028
$92,415.

1085
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:40,129
Do you have that kind of money?

1086
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:42,928
No.

1087
01:23:42,929 --> 01:23:44,189
How about assets?

1088
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:45,858
Your house?

1089
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:49,250
- Belongs to the partnership.
- Anything.

1090
01:23:59,859 --> 01:24:01,728
Come on, Decker.

1091
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:04,409
She's your (INAUDIBLE).

1092
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:06,189
I don't know, Hawk man.

1093
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,028
I mean, how much do you
still owe the bank on this?

1094
01:24:08,029 --> 01:24:10,469
About $100 grand, more or less.

1095
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:12,848
But she's worth $250.

1096
01:24:12,849 --> 01:24:14,958
Boy, I'll tell you what I'd do for you.

1097
01:24:14,959 --> 01:24:16,658
I'll give you $130.

1098
01:24:16,659 --> 01:24:17,718
What?

1099
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,349
That's ridiculous.

1100
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:20,439
I need 90 clear.

1101
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,698
That's only 30 after
I've paid back the loan.

1102
01:24:22,699 --> 01:24:25,728
Man, is it really worth all this

1103
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:29,309
for a couple of lousy dolphins?

1104
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:33,429
Yes, Decker, it is.

1105
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:35,998
Well, sorry, man.

1106
01:24:35,999 --> 01:24:36,979
I can't help you.

1107
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:56,638
What was he doing here?

1108
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,319
I asked him to buy the boat.

1109
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,319
What?

1110
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,718
- Why?
- Look.

1111
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,618
I don't want Bogie and
Bacall to be in some circus.

1112
01:25:04,619 --> 01:25:06,488
I just won't have it, OK?

1113
01:25:06,489 --> 01:25:07,568
So you're selling the boat.

1114
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:10,688
I'm buying the dolphins!

1115
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:11,718
Where will we take them?

1116
01:25:11,719 --> 01:25:12,688
Where will we live?

1117
01:25:12,689 --> 01:25:14,628
Let's worry about that
when it happens, OK?

1118
01:25:14,629 --> 01:25:16,339
And Alyssa?

1119
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:17,739
You're trying to sell
off her inheritance?

1120
01:25:21,009 --> 01:25:22,918
Right.

1121
01:25:22,919 --> 01:25:25,439
I never looked at it like that.

1122
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,728
Right.

1123
01:25:27,729 --> 01:25:29,979
Well, you might want to start
looking at it like that.

1124
01:25:58,519 --> 01:26:00,028
Hi, Dad.

1125
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:00,729
Hi.

1126
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,350
Here's your letters.

1127
01:26:18,549 --> 01:26:22,009
Hey, you didn't open them.

1128
01:26:24,919 --> 01:26:26,608
What can I say?

1129
01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:29,200
You really pissed me off.

1130
01:26:37,059 --> 01:26:39,658
You know, I asked Mom once about you.

1131
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:42,418
You know what she said?

1132
01:26:42,419 --> 01:26:44,439
She said you were a dreamer
of catastrophic proportions.

1133
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,139
What are you thinking now you've

1134
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,140
met the great catastrophe?

1135
01:27:03,849 --> 01:27:06,210
I know how much you care about them.

1136
01:27:10,069 --> 01:27:18,738
Tami cares about them too, and so do I.

1137
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:21,220
- You do?
- Yeah.

1138
01:27:41,019 --> 01:27:42,418
- What was that?
- I don't know.

1139
01:27:42,419 --> 01:27:43,249
Let's check it out.

1140
01:27:54,409 --> 01:27:55,648
What are they doing here?

1141
01:27:55,649 --> 01:27:57,249
Did Coakley send you, huh?

1142
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:58,738
Tell him he's too late.

1143
01:27:58,739 --> 01:28:01,179
I don't think so, Hawker.

1144
01:28:10,230 --> 01:28:11,608
Hold it right there, Coakley.

1145
01:28:11,609 --> 01:28:12,668
You have no right.

1146
01:28:12,669 --> 01:28:15,328
Well, as a matter of
fact, James, he does.

1147
01:28:15,329 --> 01:28:18,129
This is an article of transfer signed

1148
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:19,738
by a judge in Port Lucaya.

1149
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:22,418
And it assigns all assets
of the partnership,

1150
01:28:22,419 --> 01:28:25,458
including the dolphins,
to the majority partner.

1151
01:28:25,459 --> 01:28:27,068
And that would be Mr. Coakley here.

1152
01:28:29,839 --> 01:28:31,878
As much as it pains me to say it,

1153
01:28:31,879 --> 01:28:34,688
you are hereby evicted, Hawker.

1154
01:28:44,019 --> 01:28:46,209
I got to get my lawyer
to take a look at this.

1155
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:47,969
Call him.
We'll wait.

1156
01:30:05,649 --> 01:30:07,648
Man!

1157
01:30:07,649 --> 01:30:09,639
Goodness!
It's Alyssa.

1158
01:30:22,879 --> 01:30:23,579
Wow!

1159
01:31:02,509 --> 01:31:03,208
I'm sorry, Hawker.

1160
01:31:03,209 --> 01:31:04,528
There's nothing I can do.

1161
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:53,318
Come on, Coakley.

1162
01:31:53,319 --> 01:31:54,358
You can't do this.

1163
01:31:54,359 --> 01:31:55,208
Those dolphins are...

1164
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:57,128
Gone.

1165
01:31:57,129 --> 01:31:59,039
What the hell are you up to, Hawker?

1166
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:04,198
He let them go!

1167
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:05,087
No, he didn't.

1168
01:32:05,088 --> 01:32:07,528
I did.

1169
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:09,878
Alyssa, what have you done?

1170
01:32:09,879 --> 01:32:12,138
You know they can't survive in the wild.

1171
01:32:12,139 --> 01:32:13,868
Dad, yes they can.

1172
01:32:13,869 --> 01:32:14,969
Rasca will help them.

1173
01:32:18,039 --> 01:32:19,038
Don't worry, Dad.

1174
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:20,459
I can bring them back whenever I want.

1175
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:25,019
But some things are
going to have to change.

1176
01:32:35,659 --> 01:32:36,359
I love you, Dad!

1177
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:44,719
I don't believe it.

1178
01:34:00,689 --> 01:34:09,169
Oh, nice. (INAUDIBLE)
Wait. Here we go.

1179
01:34:17,159 --> 01:34:19,148
Dad, they don't need that.

1180
01:34:19,149 --> 01:34:20,149
They're fine.

1181
01:34:43,839 --> 01:34:48,248
And so it is my idea that we
expand the research facility

1182
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:50,408
and make it a place where
people come... not to watch

1183
01:34:50,409 --> 01:34:53,077
the dolphins perform, but to study them

1184
01:34:53,078 --> 01:34:56,748
and interact with them in
a protected environment.

1185
01:34:56,749 --> 01:35:00,208
Because I know now that we
can all learn from them,

1186
01:35:00,209 --> 01:35:03,788
not just intellectually,
but spiritually.

1187
01:35:03,789 --> 01:35:05,678
And if we open ourselves to them,

1188
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:09,338
they can reach our hearts,
as well as our minds.

1189
01:35:09,339 --> 01:35:13,057
And that people would come from
all over for a chance, not just

1190
01:35:13,058 --> 01:35:16,548
to touch the dolphins,
but to be touched by them

1191
01:35:16,549 --> 01:35:20,378
and to experience a
communication that goes deeper

1192
01:35:20,379 --> 01:35:23,808
than just science can measure.

1193
01:35:32,119 --> 01:35:34,578
Hey, hey, hey.

1194
01:35:34,579 --> 01:35:37,957
I say we give Conchy Jane a chance, eh?

1195
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:39,438
What'd you say?
All right?

1196
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:40,908
All right.

1197
01:35:47,309 --> 01:35:48,788
All right.
Hey!

1198
01:35:48,789 --> 01:35:50,328
Hold up, hold up!

1199
01:35:50,329 --> 01:35:52,077
Guess what?

1200
01:35:52,078 --> 01:35:53,508
- Drinks on Hawk this time.
- Hey!

1201
01:36:06,129 --> 01:36:09,408
You guys can touch him.
(INAUDIBLE).

1202
01:36:09,409 --> 01:36:10,609
There you go.
Gently.

1203
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:16,768
Alyssa made good on her plans,

1204
01:36:16,769 --> 01:36:18,498
with Rasca's help, of course.

1205
01:36:18,499 --> 01:36:19,847
Look at me.

1206
01:36:19,848 --> 01:36:22,027
Look.

1207
01:36:27,109 --> 01:36:29,027
Hawk still works as hard as ever,

1208
01:36:29,028 --> 01:36:30,057
chasing his dream.

1209
01:36:30,058 --> 01:36:32,438
And he's getting closer every day.

1210
01:36:32,439 --> 01:36:36,907
But along the way, he found
an unexpected treasure.

1211
01:36:36,908 --> 01:36:39,198
And now, she's his best friend.

1212
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:42,578
And they've healed each other
and made each whole in a way

1213
01:36:42,579 --> 01:36:47,348
that, well, only we fathers and
our daughters can understand.

1214
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:49,568
And as for the other
members of our family,

1215
01:36:49,569 --> 01:36:51,887
well, they're doing fine.

1216
01:36:51,888 --> 01:36:56,238
I think they're just waiting
for us to learn to listen right.

1217
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:58,057
And who knows?

1218
01:36:58,058 --> 01:36:59,708
Maybe someday we will.

1219
01:36:59,709 --> 01:37:04,408
We just have to keep our hearts
open to them and to each other.

1220
01:39:42,429 --> 01:39:43,927
Started today.
Good day.

1221
01:39:43,928 --> 01:39:45,428
First day she ever smoked.

1222
01:39:45,429 --> 01:39:47,947
She's now a smoker.

1223
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:50,418
(INAUDIBLE)

1224
01:39:50,419 --> 01:39:53,379
We're gonna practice one
real fast on rehearsal, right?

1225
01:39:58,818 --> 01:40:00,637
Wow, man.

1226
01:40:00,638 --> 01:40:04,098
Like this... hold it like this.

1227
01:40:04,099 --> 01:40:05,478
Hold it away from you.

1228
01:40:05,479 --> 01:40:07,478
Notice she doesn't bring it to her lips.

1229
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:08,978
She's just, um, playing with it.

1230
01:40:11,978 --> 01:40:13,677
And the drinking scene was water,

1231
01:40:13,678 --> 01:40:16,087
in case anyone's curious.
OK.

1232
01:40:16,088 --> 01:40:17,529
So now we gotta go (INAUDIBLE).

1233
01:40:20,898 --> 01:40:22,787
(INAUDIBLE) take one, (INAUDIBLE).

1234
01:40:22,788 --> 01:40:27,698
It's one
cigarette. (INAUDIBLE).

1235
01:40:42,299 --> 01:40:43,269
No, not now.

1236
01:40:56,718 --> 01:40:58,209
There it is.
(INAUDIBLE)

1237
01:41:03,688 --> 01:41:05,218
Ok?

1238
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:07,577
Ok.
Ok.

1239
01:41:07,578 --> 01:41:09,258
These are real conchs.

1240
01:41:09,259 --> 01:41:11,108
Check it out!

1241
01:41:11,109 --> 01:41:12,627
There's like a little creature inside.

1242
01:41:12,628 --> 01:41:14,627
And he wraps himself around in there.

1243
01:41:14,628 --> 01:41:16,657
Can you see?

1244
01:41:16,658 --> 01:41:20,378
And they're kind of like squishy.

1245
01:41:20,379 --> 01:41:22,318
Ugh, kinda gross.

1246
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:25,897
It's like snail of the sea.

1247
01:41:25,898 --> 01:41:27,907
Would you like some conch?

1248
01:41:27,908 --> 01:41:30,037
Don't... (INAUDIBLE)
so they're still connected,

1249
01:41:30,038 --> 01:41:31,647
right?
(INAUDIBLE).

1250
01:41:31,648 --> 01:41:33,179
That is (INAUDIBLE).

1251
01:41:40,868 --> 01:41:42,857
Oh, my god.

1252
01:41:42,858 --> 01:41:45,587
Actually, it was not bad, you now.

1253
01:41:45,588 --> 01:41:48,707
My first time, and I already ate three.

1254
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:50,747
Conch's (INAUDIBLE).

1255
01:41:50,748 --> 01:41:52,178
I loved it.

1256
01:41:52,179 --> 01:41:55,997
It's crunchy, one of the
nicest things I've ever eaten.

1257
01:41:55,998 --> 01:41:57,827
Hey, we're finally
done shooting the movie.

1258
01:41:57,828 --> 01:41:59,707
And it's really sad and everything.

1259
01:41:59,708 --> 01:42:02,338
We finished yesterday,
and I'm back here to uh,

1260
01:42:02,339 --> 01:42:03,547
feed the dolphins.

1261

Want some?

anything like that, you
gotta throw them out.
