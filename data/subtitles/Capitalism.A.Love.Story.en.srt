1
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:28,608
This picture,

2
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:31,298
truly one of the most
unusual ever filmed,

3
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:34,783
contains scenes which
under no circumstances

4
00:00:34,823 --> 00:00:37,441
should be viewed by anyone
with a heart condition

5
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,966
or anyone who is easily upset.

6
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,948
We urgently recommend

7
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,707
that if you are such a person
or the parent

8
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:47,939
of a young or impressionable child
now in attendance,

9
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:51,551
that you and the child
leave the auditorium.

10
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,978
- ( rock music playing )
-  Yeah

11
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:03,650
Louie Louie, whoa baby

12
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:06,019
l gotta go now

13
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:11,424
Louie Louie, whoa baby

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,882
l really gotta go now

15
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:19,295
The Communist world
is fallin' apart

16
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:23,609
The capitalists
are just breakin' hearts

17
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:26,912
Money is the reason to be

18
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:31,420
lt makes me just
wanna sing Louie Louie

19
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,971
Louie Louie, whoa baby

20
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,400
l gotta go now

21
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:42,682
Louie Louie, whoa baby

22
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:44,957
l really gotta go now

23
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:49,335
Some say it will,
some say it won't

24
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:52,606
Now you see it,
now you don't

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,950
We spent all our money
on a disaster movie

26
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,570
lt makes me wanna sing
Louie Louie

27
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:04,349
Louie Louie, whoa baby

28
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:07,102
l gotta go now

29
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:11,966
Louie Louie, whoa baby

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,170
l really gotta go now

31
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:16,215
Oh, let's give it
to 'em right now.

32
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:22,518
( trumpet playing )

33
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:37,527
Narrator: Rome was the largest
and the most beautiful city

34
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,932
of the ancient world.

35
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:42,266
The magnificent facade
of the empire, however,

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,562
could not conceal
the seeds of decay,

37
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:49,274
the unhealthy dependence
of the economy on slaves,

38
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:52,373
the disparity between
rich and poor.

39
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:54,200
Behind the splendor
of the Forum

40
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:57,170
were vast areas
of crowded slums.

41
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:01,367
Escape from the slums was difficult
for there were few jobs available

42
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:03,770
and practically none
for the unskilled.

43
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:07,000
To keep idle citizens entertained
and out of mischief,

44
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:10,930
frequent games and spectacles
were held at public expense.

45
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:14,004
At first, only chariot races
were sponsored.

46
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:15,765
But by the reign of Trajan,

47
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:18,801
brutal combat to the death
had become popular.

48
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:20,817
Earlier in Rome's history,

49
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:23,608
elected representatives
exercised the power.

50
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:25,943
But by now,
every function of government

51
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:27,920
had been absorbed
by the emperor

52
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:30,862
who was above the law
and ruled by decree.

53
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:33,719
That a people as civilized
as the Romans,

54
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:36,622
with the most humane
system of law ever devised,

55
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:38,901
could tolerate the violation
of human beings

56
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,790
is astonishing.

57
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:43,475
This imbalance
and the irresponsible behavior

58
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:46,414
of public officials
would become major reasons

59
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:49,204
for Rome's eventual decline.

60
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:54,901
Michael Moore: l wonder how
future civilizations will view our society.

61
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,723
Will they judge us by this?

62
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,700
-  He's a cat flushin' a toilet...
- ( mews )

63
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:02,539
He's a cat flushin' a toilet,
he's a cat flushin' a toilet

64
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:04,622
He's a cat flushin' a toilet.

65
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,115
( mews )

66
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:10,646
Moore: Or will they
judge us by this?

67
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,449
Man #1 :
Do you see the sheriff's car?

68
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:25,387
Man #2: Yeah, right there.
The sheriff-- that's the first car.

69
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:27,697
- Woman: No--
- There he is.

70
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,913
Man #3:
Three, four, five, six...

71
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:46,856
Woman: Seven.

72
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,937
- Man #1 : Give me the phone.
- Woman: lt's on this--

73
00:04:56,978 --> 00:05:00,043
it's on the c--
it's on the couch.

74
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,430
All right, that's as close
as l can get, Dad.

75
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:10,701
- Don't stand in front of the door, Dad.
- ( knocking )

76
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:12,973
( whispering )
Get out from the--

77
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:15,430
Hey, Sheriff, Robert
inside the house here.

78
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:18,091
- ( knocking )
- ( loud banging )

79
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,617
Woman: They're trying to beat
the back door in, Dad.

80
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:22,086
( loud banging )

81
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:24,747
There are four of us in here.
They're beating on the door.

82
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,305
We're not gonna resist,
but you will have to come

83
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:29,230
in the house on your own.

84
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:31,435
But there are four souls
in this house.

85
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:37,096
Woman: Dad, don't stand
in front of the door.

86
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,023
- Do not.
- ( doorknob rattling )

87
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:43,048
( banging continues )

88
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:47,685
Woman:
Another witness.

89
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,187
Tell your name to the camera.

90
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,125
- l'm David Phillips.
- Chris Collins.

91
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:55,435
And Audra Collins.

92
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,990
( banging continues )

93
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:02,377
- David: And this is America?
- Chris: Uh-huh.

94
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:05,543
Audra: This is America, folks,
what you're watching right here.

95
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:18,562
- Sheriff's office.
- Robert: Yeah, we know.

96
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:22,978
- Okay, y'all have to come out, please.
- Robert: All right.

97
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:27,329
Woman: We cannot act like this--
this is just something that's okay.

98
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,259
And so this is new.

99
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,040
They've never come out
and boarded up our house

100
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:33,766
after they've evicted the person

101
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:36,257
and threw their furniture
in the dumpster.

102
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,240
So they're letting us know

103
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:41,665
that they are stepping it up,

104
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:43,942
boarding up somebody's house.

105
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:45,952
This has been my family home.
This is my parents' house.

106
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:48,132
l've lived here for 41 years.

107
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:52,903
This is the only home
l've ever really lived in.

108
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,620
This is the only-- this will always
be home to me, no matter what.

109
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:57,314
- l'm a carpenter.
- Woman: There you go.

110
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,393
Man #1 : Sandra, they're leaving.
Let them leave.

111
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,855
- Man #2: l'm a carpenter. So what?
- That's all l am.

112
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:06,915
- Well, people pay their bills.
- This could happen to you.

113
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:09,341
Carpenter: That's right.
So why do you think l'm doing it?

114
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:11,423
l don't have to be happy about this,
but that's what l do.

115
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:14,213
Sandra: That's all l'm saying is that
maybe you can make another choice.

116
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:16,735
- That's all we're saying.
- That's no reason for...

117
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:18,269
Sandra:
You're a working-class person.

118
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,213
...people here to get upset
and almost get themselves hurt.

119
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:23,874
We ain't gonna get hurt.

120
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,372
Are you threatening us?

121
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:28,098
Y'all gonna get on out of here.
You might end up even getting hurt.

122
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:30,884
Talking about us getting hurt,
you might get hurt.

123
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,957
Man: There's gonna be
some kind of a rebellion

124
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:35,899
between the people
that have nothing

125
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:39,170
and the people that's got it all.

126
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:40,667
l don't understand.

127
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:42,531
There's no in-between no more.

128
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:44,572
There's the people that's got it all

129
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:46,435
and the people that have nothing.

130
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:51,677
We gotta get this stuff
out of the house and packed up

131
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:54,466
and be out of here
in about 30 days

132
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,737
even though we don't
have a place to go.

133
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:02,944
Oh.

134
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,987
Woman:
We designed this house.

135
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,889
The property that it's on
was my family farm.

136
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:15,865
So l've lost a piece
of my heritage with this.

137
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:19,485
Why do you do this
to the hard-working people?

138
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:27,807
Why do you take everything?

139
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,591
You take everything
away from them.

140
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,789
We're just middle-class,
hard-working people

141
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:35,831
trying to make a living.

142
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:41,086
Just trying to survive.

143
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,486
An old Browning.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,552
( grunts )
My pistol,

145
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:54,136
my dad's pistol, my pistol.

146
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:55,899
( sighs )

147
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,390
- ( knocking )
- Man: Sheriff's department.

148
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:00,535
lt's supposed to be 30 days.

149
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,582
l got 30 days to get my stuff out.

150
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:05,077
- That's what the guy told me.
- No.

151
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,005
What?

152
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:09,755
lt's currently scheduled for today.

153
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:11,251
But...

154
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:13,499
The paper's telling us
that we are due

155
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:16,794
to do an eviction here
today at 9:00 AM.

156
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,772
Huh, shoot.

157
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,648
Well, he's surprised too.

158
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:24,758
The house is gone.

159
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,258
That cop told me that the house

160
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:28,472
has already been sold
to somebody else.

161
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,575
So we don't own the house no more,
somebody else does.

162
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,707
Moore:
This is capitalism,

163
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,221
a system of taking and giving--

164
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,682
mostly taking.

165
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:43,546
The only thing we didn't know

166
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,645
was when the revolt would begin.

167
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:48,755
Man: Everything,
we've tried everything...

168
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:50,355
except robbing a bank.

169
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,915
l'm thinking about
maybe doing that.

170
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:56,631
You know, that's one way
somebody could get their money back.

171
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,642
lf they did it--
they did it to me,

172
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,051
l don't know why
l can't do it to them.

173
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:06,931
Peter Zalewski:
This is my second Hyundai Sonata.

174
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,376
l'll probably get a new car next year.

175
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,067
And when l do,
it'll probably be another Sonata.

176
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:11,600
You know, l'm not a car guy.

177
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,331
lf l can go in there
and steal a condo

178
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,758
for the equivalent of what
a Mercedes would cost

179
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:18,168
or a Bentley would cost,
l'm all about that.

180
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:20,951
Moore:
Meet Peter Zalewski,

181
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,254
Florida's up-and-coming
real estate whiz.

182
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,750
Here we go.

183
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:28,207
Moore: He calls his
real estate company Condo Vultures.

184
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:29,841
( stuttering )
We have a very good sign.

185
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,341
You have the final notice
of eviction.

186
00:10:31,384 --> 00:10:33,293
So you can see this person
was basically thrown out

187
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:35,091
by the police department.

188
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,981
Welcome.

189
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:39,792
Moore:
Peter deals exclusively

190
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,001
with clients who buy up
foreclosed homes

191
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,374
and then resell them at a profit.

192
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,927
lt's gonna be about
830 square feet or so...

193
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:49,006
At the end of the day,
the only people who are buying

194
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,020
are primarily individuals
that we represent...

195
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:53,428
Today it's on the market
for $66,000.

196
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:55,633
...which are basically bottom feeders
who are going in there.

197
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:57,459
They have no compassion,
no sensitivity.

198
00:10:57,494 --> 00:11:00,144
They're running purely off numbers
They're coming in all cash,

199
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,482
and they're looking to slit
any single seller's throat

200
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:04,524
regardless of what
their situation is.

201
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:06,769
So people always ask,
''What's 25 cents on the dollar?''

202
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:08,495
This is it.
This is what you're gonna get.

203
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,599
The vulture basically represents
a bottom feeder

204
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:14,768
that goes in there
and cleans off a carcass.

205
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:17,225
Because they're dealing with
so many different germs and situations,

206
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:19,471
they'll have to vomit on themselves
and there's some sort

207
00:11:19,508 --> 00:11:21,363
of cleansing process that occurs.

208
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,184
The vultures
aren't actually killing,

209
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,909
they're the ones
doing the clean-up.

210
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:26,375
Which bank you want?
Bank of America?

211
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,207
What we do is we tap into data...

212
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:29,769
and boom, voila.

213
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:33,039
Here we got 3,400 foreclosing
by Bank of America.

214
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:34,481
Gotta love it.

215
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,937
As we collect data,
it's giving us

216
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:39,596
the insight into the battlefield,

217
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:42,864
almost like a drone that flies
over the battleground in Afghanistan

218
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:45,745
or in Pakistan or in lraq.

219
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:47,850
The current asking price is 355.

220
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:49,864
Again, it was purchased for 840.

221
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:52,109
A little bit of a discount.
You're gonna have two...

222
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,153
Our people are using
that data to be able to go in

223
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:57,062
and try to steal properties,
legally and ethically,

224
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:59,047
but take them at the bare-bone
bottom price.

225
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:00,975
lt's all about taking right now.

226
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:03,789
Look at the-- look at the roof--
completely gone and missing.

227
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:06,192
We haven't had a hurricane
in five years.

228
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:08,166
( laughing )

229
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:10,629
Welcome to the housing crash,
Miami style.

230
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:12,297
So this-- this is what capitalism is

231
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:14,408
and this is why the information
is so critical.

232
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:15,942
We go in there,
we alert them to it,

233
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:17,413
and if they like it, you know--

234
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:19,342
( imitates shotgun )

235
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,750
- Look at the window.
- Look at that.

236
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,474
Looks like the house
next door was on fire.

237
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,299
This is straight up capitalism.

238
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:26,724
- Fire damage.
- l wonder if somebody was living there...

239
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,677
Zalewski: Everybody's got
this desire to go in there

240
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,052
and take advantage
of others' misfortunes.

241
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,165
Somebody asked me,

242
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:34,278
''What's the difference between
you and a real vulture?''

243
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:37,034
l said, ''lt's very simple.
l don't vomit on myself.''

244
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:42,244
Our topic today:
What is capitalism?

245
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:43,398
Capitalism?

246
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:45,804
Well, why should there be
any question about it?

247
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:49,153
Hasn't it given us the highest
standard of living in the world?

248
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:51,815
We're free to try to make a profit,

249
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:54,057
to just get by, or to fail.

250
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:56,001
That's what capitalism is:

251
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,432
a system of free enterprise.

252
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,679
Now tell us what
''free enterprise'' means.

253
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:04,201
Moore: l went to see
my friend Wally Shawn,

254
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:06,341
a playwright
and sometimes actor.

255
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:07,841
lnconceivable!

256
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:10,981
Moore: But Wally also studied
history and politics

257
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:13,769
and even a little
elementary economics.

258
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:17,894
Free enterprise
is a form of words

259
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,548
that is intended
to conjure up in your mind

260
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:25,321
a little town with different shops.

261
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:28,168
And the guy who runs
the best shop

262
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,591
has the most customers.

263
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:32,936
Narrator: There is the basis
of the capitalistic system:

264
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:34,495
the profit motive.

265
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:37,254
He's in business to make money.

266
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,655
Shawn: The original
theory of capitalism

267
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:42,557
is that it's a very clever way

268
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,790
of society voting on what goods

269
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,125
it wants made.

270
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,915
What do you use this for?

271
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:54,629
That's-- l could use that
for practically everything l ever do.

272
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:58,177
You know, society votes.

273
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:00,386
They like the way this guy

274
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,009
makes ice cream.

275
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,607
But the other guy,

276
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:07,842
they don't like
his ice cream that much

277
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,548
and they don't buy it,
so it fades out.

278
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:15,101
lt's on me.
That is a good fit.

279
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:19,298
Shawn: The basic law of life
is that if you have things,

280
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,562
you can easily get more things.

281
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:25,466
Very quickly, one guy can have

282
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:28,095
five times more
than anybody else.

283
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,433
- Free enterprise.
- Competition.

284
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,875
Woman:
The profit motive.

285
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:36,577
Moore: My dad, an assembly-line
worker at General Motors,

286
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:38,206
bought and paid for our house

287
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,756
before l graduated
from kindergarten.

288
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:44,796
We had a new car
every three years.

289
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:49,472
We went to New York
every other summer.

290
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:52,354
That's me on Wall Street.

291
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:54,209
And that's me
directing my first movie

292
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:55,705
at the World's Fair.

293
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:59,609
We went to Catholic schools,
we lived a good life.

294
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:04,510
lf this was capitalism,
l loved it...

295
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:06,913
and so did everyone else.

296
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:10,774
During these years
a lot of people got rich

297
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:14,647
and they had to pay
a top tax rate of 90%.

298
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,697
90% ?

299
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:18,493
Yep.

300
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:22,903
But they still got to live
like Bogie and Bacall.

301
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:25,182
And what did we do
with all their money?

302
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,868
We built damns, bridges,

303
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:31,548
interstate highways,
schools, hospitals.

304
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:33,918
We even sent a guy to the moon.

305
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:36,254
Things seemed to be going
in the right direction.

306
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:39,221
Dad had a secure job
and Mom could work

307
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,597
if she wanted,
but didn't have to.

308
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:45,374
Middle-class families only needed
one income to survive.

309
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,538
Our union family had
free health care and free dental.

310
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:51,890
The kids could go to college
without getting a loan from a bank.

311
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:55,414
Dad had four weeks
paid vacation every summer.

312
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:59,130
Most people had
a savings account and little debt.

313
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:02,778
And Dad's pension was set aside
where no one could touch it.

314
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:06,643
lt would be there for him
when he retired.

315
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:10,580
We got all of this because
our main industrial competition

316
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,043
had been reduced to rubble.

317
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:15,638
Here's what the German
car industry looked like.

318
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:18,971
And here's the Japanese
auto industry.

319
00:16:19,004 --> 00:16:21,011
l guess you could say
it's easy to be number one

320
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:23,866
when you have no competition.

321
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,355
Yes, of course
not everything was perfect.

322
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,217
We didn't mind having to put up

323
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:31,066
with a little bit of this
and a little bit of that...

324
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:36,084
just as long as we could be
middle-class.

325
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,875
And we could count on our kids
having it better than we had it.

326
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:45,110
lt sounded like
a good deal to us.

327
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:49,139
Capitalism-- no one
ever had it so good.

328
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:58,639
And then, right when
we were in the middle

329
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:01,976
of this big love affair
with capitalism...

330
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:04,343
Announcer: The ABC
Sunday Night Movie ''The Gambler''

331
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:05,970
will continue in its entirety

332
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:09,457
following this live report
from ABC News.

333
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:14,165
We are at a turning point
in our history.

334
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,371
Moore:
Along came Debbie Downer.

335
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:20,019
Too many of us now
tend to worship

336
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:24,278
self-indulgence
and consumption.

337
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,140
Human identity
is no longer defined

338
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:31,760
by what one does,

339
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:34,548
but by what one owns.

340
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:36,174
This is not a message

341
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:39,630
of happiness or reassurance,

342
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,807
but it is the truth

343
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:43,755
and it is a warning.

344
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:45,684
Moore:
Wow, what a bummer.

345
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:48,718
lt was time to bring
a new sheriff to town...

346
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:49,804
( horse whinnies )

347
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:52,211
...one who knew how to act
like a president.

348
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:55,757
He knew how to handle workers
who wanted a better wage.

349
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:57,968
( gunshot )

350
00:17:58,003 --> 00:18:00,818
All right, mister, l guess you win.

351
00:18:00,852 --> 00:18:02,280
Moore:
Or these annoying feminists

352
00:18:02,324 --> 00:18:04,974
whining about their
Equal Rights Amendment.

353
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:07,378
Well, l can change that in a hurry.

354
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:12,655
Moore: A man who knew
how to get the job done.

355
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,074
Ronald Reagan
came out of the B movies

356
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:20,107
to become the most famous
corporate spokesman of the 1950s.

357
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:22,731
lt's a transistor radio too.
Weighs only a few ounces.

358
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,144
You can slip it
right into your pocket.

359
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:26,446
Boraxo waterless hand cleaner
really cleans up for us.

360
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:28,336
Moore:
He had found his calling

361
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:31,183
and Wall Street
had found their man.

362
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:34,152
You see, the banks and corporations
had a simple plan:

363
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:37,422
to remake America to serve them.

364
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:38,983
But to pull it off would require

365
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:41,926
electing a spokesmodel
for president.

366
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:45,994
And on November 4th, 1980,
that's what we did.

367
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:47,788
...that l will faithfully execute

368
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:49,929
the office of President
of the United States.

369
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:52,074
Crowd:
Ronald Ronald Ronald...

370
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:54,250
Thank you.

371
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:56,905
Moore:
lt was an historic moment

372
00:18:56,943 --> 00:18:59,595
because now corporate America
and Wall Street

373
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:02,500
were in almost complete control.

374
00:19:02,544 --> 00:19:05,128
See that guy standing
next to the president?

375
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,916
You know, the one
that looks like a butler?

376
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:10,220
His name was Don Regan,

377
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:12,425
the Chairman of Merrill Lynch,

378
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:16,805
the richest and biggest
retail brokerage firm in the world.

379
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:19,693
He took the key position
of Treasury Secretary

380
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:23,435
so he could enact the tax cuts
that the rich wanted.

381
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,673
Regan then became
White House Chief of Staff

382
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:29,124
as the president started to fade.

383
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:32,164
Then they should give the president
what 43 governors have,

384
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,572
a line-item veto.

385
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:36,676
- And...
- ( applause )

386
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,612
- You're gonna have to speed it up.
- Oh.

387
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:43,685
Moore: Who tells the president
to speed it up?

388
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:47,401
The man from Merrill Lynch,
that's who.

389
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:51,712
Things in America would never
be the same again.

390
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:55,050
The country would now be run
like a corporation.

391
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,089
We're going to turn the bull loose.

392
00:19:57,131 --> 00:20:00,358
( cheering, applause )

393
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:03,842
Moore: And four years later,
when Reagan ran for reelection,

394
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:07,178
it was all smiley faces
and happy talk.

395
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,632
l really feel that we're gonna
be better off in the long run.

396
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:12,488
We're on the upward swing

397
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:15,903
and the factories are working
much stronger than before.

398
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:18,247
We're back on top.

399
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:23,910
Moore: Actually,
what Reagan presided over

400
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:28,319
was the wholesale dismantling
of our industrial infrastructure.

401
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,037
This was not done to save money
or remain competitive,

402
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:34,047
as companies back then
were already posting

403
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:37,349
record earnings in the billions.

404
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:40,961
No, it was done
for short-term profits...

405
00:20:44,903 --> 00:20:47,684
and to destroy the unions.

406
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:50,685
Millions of people
were thrown out of work

407
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:53,923
and the remaining workers
were told to work twice as hard.

408
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:58,650
But wages for working people
remained frozen.

409
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:03,201
The richest Americans
had their top income tax rate

410
00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:06,051
cut in half.

411
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:10,779
lnstead of being paid
a decent wage,

412
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,471
we were encouraged
to live on borrowed money

413
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:17,403
until our household debt
was nearly 100% of the GDP.

414
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:20,478
There was an explosion
of personal bankruptcies.

415
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:24,226
We found it necessary to lock up
millions of our citizens.

416
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,463
Sales of antidepressants
skyrocketed

417
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,988
as insurance
and pharmaceutical company greed

418
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:32,094
pushed the cost
of healthcare up and up.

419
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:35,513
All of this was great news
for the stock market

420
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:38,489
and for America's CEOs.

421
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:44,923
Moore:
Half of Flint was now receiving

422
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:47,996
some form
of government welfare.

423
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:49,822
During the end
of the Reagan years,

424
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:52,955
l made my first movie about
what had happened to the country

425
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:56,309
and specifically to my hometown
of Flint, Michigan,

426
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:59,451
the birthplace of General Motors.

427
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,199
GM was posting profits
of over $4 billion

428
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:05,143
while at the same time eliminating

429
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:07,836
tens of thousands of jobs.

430
00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:11,647
l went to see GM's chief lobbyist
in Flint, Mr. Tom Kay,

431
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,746
to ask him why
this was happening.

432
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,653
General Motors wouldn't be doing
anybody any service

433
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:19,103
if it goes bankrupt.

434
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:20,826
lt has to do what it has to do

435
00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:23,930
in order to stay competitive
in today's economic climate.

436
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,862
Moore: Even if that means
eliminating 18,000 jobs?

437
00:22:27,903 --> 00:22:30,750
Even if it means
eliminating 20,000 jobs.

438
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,986
- Or 30,000?
- Whatever.

439
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:37,397
- How about all the jobs here in Flint?
- lt could feasibly happen.

440
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:39,893
Moore: And it did.

441
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:42,616
Nearly all the jobs were eliminated

442
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,304
and GM went bankrupt.

443
00:22:47,037 --> 00:22:50,517
Perhaps more distressing was the fact
that the rest of America

444
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:54,518
was now starting to resemble
Flint, Michigan.

445
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:58,549
But there were some cities
that still took pride in their greatness.

446
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:00,278
Cleveland

447
00:23:00,317 --> 00:23:02,705
Come on down
to Cleveland Town, everyone

448
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:05,530
Come and look
at both of our buildings

449
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:08,248
Here's the place where
there used to be industry

450
00:23:08,284 --> 00:23:11,000
This train is carrying jobs
out of Cleveland

451
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:13,903
See the sun almost
three times a year

452
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:16,597
This guy has at least two DUls

453
00:23:16,635 --> 00:23:19,450
Our economy's
based on LeBron James

454
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,199
Buy a house
for the price of a VCR

455
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,819
Our main export
is crippling depression

456
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:27,705
We're so retarded
that we think this is art

457
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:32,177
lt could be worse, though,
at least we're not Detroit

458
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:34,323
We're not Detroit.

459
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:37,906
Moore:
No, they're not Detroit.

460
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:40,465
For 20 years l tried
to warn GM and others

461
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:44,018
that this day was coming,
but to no avail.

462
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:46,228
Maybe now they'd listen.

463
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:48,598
So l went down to the headquarters
of General Motors

464
00:23:48,632 --> 00:23:52,144
one last time to share
some of my ideas.

465
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:54,257
You don't have permission.
You can't film here.

466
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:55,243
Huh?

467
00:23:55,288 --> 00:23:57,011
You don't have permission
from General Motors.

468
00:23:57,048 --> 00:23:59,536
- You can't film here.
- l'm just going up to see the chairman.

469
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:01,484
No, sir.
No, sir.

470
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:03,665
You know, l've been doing this
for, like, 20 years.

471
00:24:03,702 --> 00:24:05,132
l understand, sir.

472
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:08,523
And l have not been
let into this building for 20 years,

473
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:12,079
and l think it's about time
someone just let me in

474
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,679
and let me talk to them.

475
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,507
l've got some good ideas.

476
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:19,798
4-7 to 7-6 Bravo Area Alpha.

477
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:22,132
Man:
Go ahead.

478
00:24:22,165 --> 00:24:25,265
lt's Michael Moore here
to see the chairman.

479
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:29,898
Repeat that.

480
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:31,949
lt's the filmmaker
Mr. Michael Moore.

481
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:33,897
He's here to see the chairman.

482
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:36,619
- Gentlemen.
- Yes.

483
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:38,962
You need to get prior permission.
You cannot film here, okay?

484
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:41,614
But if l can't go in and get permission,
what am l supposed to do?

485
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:44,040
l guess they're right.
Breaking up is hard to do.

486
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:46,288
Stop that. Don't do that.
Just go in the building.

487
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:48,909
Moore: For 35 years,
GM made more money

488
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,954
than any other corporation.

489
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:52,521
But eventually,
Germany and Japan

490
00:24:52,564 --> 00:24:55,247
rebuilt their car industry
and produced vehicles

491
00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:58,184
that were safer than ours,
more fuel efficient

492
00:24:58,227 --> 00:25:00,299
and rarely, if ever, broke down.

493
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:07,472
ln Germany, unions help hire and fire
the board of directors

494
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,768
so the workers have a say
in what's going on.

495
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:15,431
You see, the people
of Japan and Germany

496
00:25:15,698 --> 00:25:18,992
fight to make sure that even
their conservative political leaders

497
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:21,065
don't destroy their middle class.

498
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,752
So where exactly
are we right now?

499
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:32,167
On the day that General Motors
declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy,

500
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:35,502
l went with my dad to visit
the AC Spark Plug plant

501
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:38,022
where he had worked
for over 30 years.

502
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:41,576
- So you worked actually right here.
- You'd have to go--

503
00:25:41,615 --> 00:25:45,259
they had a ramp that took you
up over that, just beyond that...

504
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:46,757
- Just beyond that space there?
- Yeah.

505
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:48,708
- And then the factory was all over there?
- Yeah.

506
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,052
Moore: The whole complex
is, like, two miles long.

507
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:53,324
l remember Mom bringing
us kids in to pick you up.

508
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:55,181
- 2:30 every day.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

509
00:25:55,214 --> 00:25:58,116
You'd walk out of there,
right over in there in fact.

510
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,046
And we'd be waiting
in the car for you

511
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:02,467
and we'd see you
come down the ramp.

512
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:05,957
We got real excited
every time we saw you.

513
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,385
l was there 33 1/2 years.

514
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:10,403
- 33 1/2 years?
- Uh-huh.

515
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,127
Moore: What's your best memory here,
being here, working here?

516
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:16,199
My best memory?
l think the people.

517
00:26:16,237 --> 00:26:18,146
They were a really good bunch.

518
00:26:18,189 --> 00:26:20,938
- You liked the crowd you worked with?
- Yeah.

519
00:26:20,972 --> 00:26:24,104
Frank Moore:
A good place to work. l enjoyed it.

520
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,888
But l'm sorry to see it go.

521
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:36,805
Moore:
Shortly before Christmas 2008,

522
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:39,843
Republic Windows & Doors
in Chicago, lllinois,

523
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:42,981
abruptly fired
its entire unionized workforce

524
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,953
of over 250 people.

525
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:49,310
They were given
only three days' notice.

526
00:26:49,354 --> 00:26:51,328
Bank of America
would no longer provide

527
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:53,474
a line of credit to the company,

528
00:26:53,513 --> 00:26:57,442
and so the workers were not paid
the money owed to them.

529
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,163
Man #1 : My life revolves
around this job.

530
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:04,194
l live according to my obligation
to my job, you know?

531
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:08,127
And it's not just me,
it's all of the workers here.

532
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,852
We go above and beyond

533
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:13,375
the call of duty for Republic.

534
00:27:13,415 --> 00:27:16,034
And at the end,

535
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:18,788
Republic cares nothing for us.

536
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,398
Man #2: We found out that
they're gonna shut the plant on Tuesday.

537
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:26,529
We don't deserve what
they're doing to us, you know?

538
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:29,730
lt really hurts because,
like l said,

539
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:31,653
this is my second family.

540
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:34,173
So it was-- it really hurts.
lt really hurts.

541
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:37,955
l'm gonna miss
all of them, you know?

542
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,837
l'm gonna miss them
and l don't think

543
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:43,106
anybody on this planet

544
00:27:43,142 --> 00:27:46,240
deserves what they've done to us.

545
00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:55,386
Moore: Scenes like this
were being repeated

546
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:59,323
all over the country,
and no one seemed to mind.

547
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:01,666
Zambezi, Zambezi

548
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,700
-  Zambezi, Zam.
- Woman: Whoo!

549
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,449
Moore: The president was enjoying
his final year in office.

550
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:10,688
But as the economy
started to fall apart,

551
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:14,684
he decided it was time
to roll out the C word.

552
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:17,625
Capitalism is the best system
ever devised.

553
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,009
Moore:
Huh. Really?

554
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:22,173
Voices from the left and right
are equating the free enterprise system

555
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:25,722
with greed and exploitation
and failure.

556
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:27,672
Moore:
Hmm, greed,

557
00:28:27,713 --> 00:28:30,747
exploitation, failure?

558
00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:32,248
Go on, l'm listening.

559
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:36,960
Capitalism offers people
the freedom to choose

560
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:39,449
where they work
and what they do...

561
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:42,075
Reporter: Pat Andrews
has been looking for work.

562
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:45,822
Every morning she scans
the classifieds in vain.

563
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:47,547
There isn't anything in here.

564
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:50,398
l'm not gonna be a gentleman's club
hired dancer either.

565
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:55,028
...the opportunity to buy
or sell products they want.

566
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:56,926
Reporter: Tom Rendon
has avoided layoffs

567
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:59,512
at his sign company
in Stockton, California,

568
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:01,374
all because this one word
now makes up

569
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,382
for half his business.

570
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:06,838
lf you seek social justice
and human dignity,

571
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,556
the free market system
is the way to go.

572
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,217
( applause )

573
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,310
Moore: And for those seeking
justice in Pennsylvania,

574
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:20,093
free enterprise
was definitely the way to go.

575
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:25,047
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,

576
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:27,157
has one of the highest rates
in the state

577
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,678
of young people locked up
in the juvenile home.

578
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:32,952
Perhaps it's because
the good people here

579
00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:35,258
employ the practices
of capitalism

580
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:38,392
in dealing with
their wayward youth.

581
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:41,211
The county hired a private
profit-making corporation

582
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:45,204
with a sweet-sounding name,
PA Child Care.

583
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:49,211
lt was owned and run
by two businessmen,

584
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:53,717
one of whom was Robert Powell,
an attorney and entrepreneur.

585
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:55,609
His good friend Judge Conahan

586
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:57,912
closed down
the public juvenile home

587
00:29:57,947 --> 00:29:59,801
and then got
PA Child Care to build

588
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:02,867
an $8 million
privately-owned facility

589
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:04,729
and charge it back to the county

590
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,347
for a mere $58 million lease.

591
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,690
Let's meet some of Wilkes-Barre's
juvenile delinquents.

592
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,933
Magee smoked pot
at a high school party.

593
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,067
l was very rebellious
when l was at this age.

594
00:30:18,105 --> 00:30:20,788
Moore: Matt, he got into
an argument at the dinner table.

595
00:30:20,826 --> 00:30:23,378
l threw a piece of meat,
as in steak,

596
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,784
cooked dinner,
at my mother's boyfriend.

597
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:28,086
Moore: Jamie got in a fight
at a shopping mall

598
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:29,330
with her best friend.

599
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:32,663
l just figured, you know, we just weren't
gonna be friends anymore.

600
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,117
Moore: And Hillary made
a MySpace page

601
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:37,232
making fun
of her assistant principal

602
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:39,661
for being strict and having
no sense of humor.

603
00:30:39,703 --> 00:30:42,999
And it said some pretty silly,
like, 14-year-old-girl stuff.

604
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:46,609
Moore: Her assistant principal
called the police.

605
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:50,770
They all appeared before
kindly Judge Mark Ciavarella.

606
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,424
These kids were about
to get their first lesson

607
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:55,351
in American capitalism:

608
00:30:55,383 --> 00:30:59,987
time is money, lots of money.

609
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:03,185
l went in front of the court,
in front of Mr. Ciavarella,

610
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:04,944
and l wasn't even in front of him
for four minutes.

611
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:06,990
l was only in front of him
for, like, two minutes.

612
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:10,509
Hillary: The first thing that
Judge Ciavarella said to me was,

613
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:13,298
''What makes you think
you can do this kind of crap?''

614
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,666
l'm sure he knew in his mind
when l walked in

615
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:17,391
that he was locking this kid up
no matter what.

616
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:18,673
He didn't even look at me.

617
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:21,556
Once l entered the courtroom,
l didn't have any chance.

618
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,759
There was about six kids
who went in front of me.

619
00:31:23,796 --> 00:31:25,738
Every single kid who went
in front of Ciavarella,

620
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:29,009
for all different reasons--
some minor, some serious--

621
00:31:29,044 --> 00:31:30,669
got sent away.

622
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:34,449
Moore: Although Wilkes-Barre is located
in the United States of America,

623
00:31:34,483 --> 00:31:38,444
here capitalism
trumped democracy.

624
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:41,580
Robert Powell, one of the owners
of PA Child Care,

625
00:31:41,618 --> 00:31:45,840
cut a business deal with Judge Conahan
and Judge Ciavarella.

626
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:49,170
Judge Ciavarella then stepped up
his conviction rates.

627
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:50,859
Many of these kids
were funneled

628
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:55,470
into PA Child Care's
for-profit juvenile facility.

629
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:56,847
And for their troubles,

630
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,906
the judges received
over $2.6 million

631
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:04,741
while the owners of PA Child Care
received tens of millions

632
00:32:04,785 --> 00:32:07,272
of taxpayer dollars
from the county.

633
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:10,313
And where did Powell go
to enjoy all that money?

634
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:12,458
On his private plane

635
00:32:12,496 --> 00:32:15,431
and his yacht,
the ''Reel Justice.''

636
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,741
6,500 children
were unjustly convicted.

637
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:25,038
lt was good business
while it lasted.

638
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:28,875
Reporter #1 : Two Luzerne County
judges in big trouble with the law.

639
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:29,858
They're going to jail.

640
00:32:29,903 --> 00:32:31,278
Reporter #2:
Some kids were locked up

641
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,402
even when probation officers
objected to detention.

642
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:38,307
ln there you lose track of time
and you lose track of the date.

643
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:39,528
l was barely keeping track.

644
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:42,566
lt was supposed to be, like--
l believe it was, like, two months.

645
00:32:42,605 --> 00:32:44,907
And it went from two months
to nine months.

646
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:47,527
He said originally
three to six months,

647
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:51,394
but somehow l ended up
being there 11 1/2 months

648
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,153
and l never went back
in front of the judge at all

649
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:55,750
for him to give me extensions.

650
00:32:55,788 --> 00:32:57,511
Moore:
Not only did PA Child Care

651
00:32:57,548 --> 00:33:00,265
pay off the judges
to fill their cells,

652
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,854
but their employees were the ones
who got to decide

653
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:06,153
when a child had
enough rehabilitation.

654
00:33:06,188 --> 00:33:09,384
But that makes sense,
because any time a governmental unit

655
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,875
turns over to
a profit-making corporation

656
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:14,217
the duties it should be performing,

657
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:16,193
what do you expect to happen?

658
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:18,722
Matt: lt makes me feel like
an item that they just used

659
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,065
to just get money
and then tossed me aside.

660
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:25,375
l'm just trying
to work on my flying

661
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:27,523
and just trying to prepare
for my future

662
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:30,661
so l can put this all behind me,
finally be done with all this.

663
00:33:30,698 --> 00:33:33,065
During the whole trial
l wasn't in control at all,

664
00:33:33,097 --> 00:33:35,432
but with flying it's only me.

665
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:37,833
lt's just that l just get
to do everything by myself.

666
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:39,807
l'm the only one on the control.

667
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:41,605
Moore:
Matt loves to fly

668
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:44,772
and hopes to become
a pilot someday.

669
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:47,328
lf he does,
he'll get his second lesson

670
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:49,855
in capitalism:

671
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:52,798
that in America,
sometimes you're better off

672
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,176
working at Mickey D's.

673
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:57,632
- ( applause, cheering )
- Remember Sully?

674
00:33:57,672 --> 00:33:58,948
Captain Sullenberger,

675
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:01,885
who safely landed an airbus
in the Hudson River

676
00:34:01,928 --> 00:34:04,829
- saving the lives of 150 passengers?
- ( patriotic music playing )

677
00:34:04,872 --> 00:34:07,621
- Man: A true American hero.
- ( applause )

678
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,413
Moore: He met the mayor.
He went to the State of the Union.

679
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:16,032
Heck, he even went
to the Super Bowl.

680
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,208
And then he went to Congress.

681
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:21,181
Sullenberger:
Flying has been my lifelong passion.

682
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:23,293
But while l love my profession,

683
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:25,920
l do not like
what has happened to it.

684
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:27,965
- ( music halts )
- lt is my personal experience

685
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:31,072
that my decision to remain
in the profession l love

686
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,550
has come at a great financial cost
to me and to my family.

687
00:34:35,588 --> 00:34:37,760
My pay has been cut 40%.

688
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:41,309
My pension, like most airline pensions,
has been terminated.

689
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:44,731
So please do not think l exaggerate
when l say that l do not know

690
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:47,936
a single professional airline pilot
who wants his or her children

691
00:34:47,972 --> 00:34:49,498
to follow in their footsteps.

692
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:52,157
Moore: Whoa, you cleared
the room with that one, Sully.

693
00:34:52,195 --> 00:34:54,398
l don't think the congressmen
wanted to hear that stuff.

694
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:57,250
- They like you as a hero.
- The current experience...

695
00:34:57,284 --> 00:34:59,672
( patriotic music over dialogue )

696
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,208
Moore: What was
your starting pay as a pilot?

697
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:15,454
l made $19,000 the first year.

698
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,806
l was bumped up to about 22,000
or 23,000 the second year.

699
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:21,369
Last year, gross pay

700
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:23,744
l made $17,600.

701
00:35:23,777 --> 00:35:26,264
There's a joke in the airline
when we get our wings pinned on us

702
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:29,621
as new-hire airline pilots
that the company just kinda says,

703
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,315
''Hey, don't apply for food stamps
in your uniform.''

704
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:35,101
Moore: l don't know about you,
but l want the pilot

705
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:38,780
who's got me 30,000 feet up in the air
to be paid really well

706
00:35:38,815 --> 00:35:41,750
and not sitting up in the cockpit
digging through the pilot's seat

707
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,702
looking for loose change.

708
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,630
There was a period
of about four months

709
00:35:45,664 --> 00:35:48,313
where l was on food stamps.

710
00:35:48,351 --> 00:35:49,780
- You were on food stamps?
- Yes.

711
00:35:49,824 --> 00:35:52,474
- And you were still flying the plane?
- Yes.

712
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,780
With my--
with my food stamp card.

713
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:57,465
The lady l talked to
in the food stamp office,

714
00:35:57,503 --> 00:36:00,318
when l told her l was a pilot,
she didn't bat an eye,

715
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:02,586
but she didn't--
l knew she didn't believe me.

716
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:05,141
Moore: How have you gotten by?
How have you been able to afford things?

717
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:07,670
Relying on credit cards
to buy the groceries at times

718
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,367
- when l wasn't on food stamps.
- Oh, really?

719
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:11,608
l have about $10,000
in credit card debt

720
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:13,554
just on the necessities,

721
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:16,052
not on the big-screen TV
and the stereo.

722
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:19,159
Moore: You're using it
to buy your groceries and get by.

723
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:21,050
- Yes.
- Do you have any student loan debt?

724
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:22,710
- Yes.
- How much?

725
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,242
Mine is about 80,000.

726
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:27,545
- l took out $100,000.
- Moore: Student loans?

727
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:30,329
And by the time l pay it back,
at this rate,

728
00:36:30,364 --> 00:36:32,632
it'll probably cost me well over
a half a million with interest

729
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:35,123
and fees and penalties.

730
00:36:35,164 --> 00:36:37,302
lt's something that l don't--
l don't like to spend a lot of time

731
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:38,965
thinking about
because it's abysmal.

732
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:41,369
lt's one way that l get down
really quickly

733
00:36:41,403 --> 00:36:42,996
about my chosen career field

734
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,369
is to think about how much l owe
and how little l make.

735
00:36:45,402 --> 00:36:48,184
Moore: Have you had to work
a second job to make ends meet?

736
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:50,487
l walk dogs on the side,

737
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:53,588
l distribute MonaVie Juice.

738
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:56,757
l have known pilots
to donate plasma

739
00:36:56,793 --> 00:36:58,550
for extra cash.

740
00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:01,335
- You mean they give blood?
- They-- well--

741
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:03,889
So they can make extra money
even though they're flying an airplane?

742
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,838
Yeah.
They donate their plasma.

743
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,972
So they get the blood back,
but you can get paid for plasma.

744
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:11,251
- ( chuckles )
- Oh, l see.

745
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:13,012
They suck the blood out of you,
take the plasma...

746
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:14,454
- Give you the blood back.
- ...give you the--

747
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:16,277
Oh, well then,
not such a bad deal.

748
00:37:16,313 --> 00:37:19,661
The only reason people stay flying
is because they love it.

749
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,492
And managements
take advantage of that.

750
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:24,724
The airlines
have managed to farm out

751
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,983
a lot of the flying to commuters

752
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:32,081
in an effort to basically
bust the unions.

753
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,126
You can't compete

754
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:38,224
to a lower and lower level
every year

755
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:40,563
without skimping
on safety somehow.

756
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:47,378
Moore: At approximately 10:15 PM
on February 1 2, 2009,

757
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:50,032
Continental connection flight 3407

758
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,557
began its descent
to the airport in Buffalo.

759
00:37:52,597 --> 00:37:54,222
( sirens wailing )

760
00:37:54,262 --> 00:37:56,050
Man: Stand by, there's some
ground communication,

761
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:57,907
either state police
or sheriff's department.

762
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,567
We need to find out if anything
is on the ground.

763
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:01,907
This aircraft was five miles out,
and all of a sudden

764
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,697
we have no response
to that aircraft.

765
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:06,601
All l could tell you is there was
an aircraft over the marker

766
00:38:06,643 --> 00:38:09,545
and we're not talking to them now.

767
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,659
Moore:
No one survived the crash

768
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,514
and 50 people lost their lives.

769
00:38:15,987 --> 00:38:19,119
The media focused
on the actions of the pilots.

770
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:22,090
Reporter: Captain Marvin Renslow
and First Officer Shaw

771
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,269
were chatting about their careers.

772
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:26,576
Moore:
''Careers'' is a euphemism

773
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,911
for what the pilots
were really talking about:

774
00:38:28,947 --> 00:38:32,907
how little they were paid
and how overworked they were.

775
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:34,954
There would be
no discussion in the media

776
00:38:34,994 --> 00:38:37,164
about why we have
an economic system

777
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:40,681
that allows a pilot to be paid less
than a manager at Taco Bell.

778
00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:42,063
Reporter:
First Officer Shaw

779
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:45,577
made between
$16,000 and $20,000 a year

780
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:49,032
and at one point
worked a second job.

781
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:51,407
Moore: Her second job
had been waitressing

782
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,349
at a coffee shop.

783
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:57,990
How are these companies
able to get away with this?

784
00:38:58,032 --> 00:39:00,617
( laughs )
l guess that's the point of capitalism.

785
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:03,306
lt allows you to get away
with anything,

786
00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:06,574
like making a profit
off the death of an employee.

787
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,347
Sweetie, l can open it.
Let's try it with this.

788
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:12,358
Moore:
This is lrma Johnson.

789
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:15,246
lrma's husband Dan
worked in middle management

790
00:39:15,278 --> 00:39:17,351
at Amegy Bank in Houston, Texas.

791
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:19,364
- Wanna try to spread it?
- No.

792
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:21,827
Moore:
Dan recently died of cancer,

793
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:25,929
leaving behind lrma
and their two sons.

794
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:28,420
But unbeknownst to lrma,
Amegy had taken out

795
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:32,257
a secret life insurance policy
on Dan's life.

796
00:39:32,302 --> 00:39:36,360
The bank generously named itself
as the beneficiary

797
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:38,786
in the event of Dan's death.

798
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:41,829
The insurance company
then accidentally informed lrma

799
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:45,829
that Amegy Bank had received
a check for $1 1/2 million

800
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:48,684
just weeks after Dan died.

801
00:39:48,715 --> 00:39:50,438
Thank you for helping.

802
00:39:50,476 --> 00:39:51,489
Johnson:
They never told me.

803
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:54,914
l wanted to find out, well,
why did they purchase a policy for him?

804
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:56,811
- Moore: You didn't know about it?
- No.

805
00:39:56,842 --> 00:40:00,356
And they named themselves
as the beneficiary.

806
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:01,344
Yeah.

807
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:03,458
Moore:
So your husband's death

808
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,347
made them $1.5 million richer?

809
00:40:06,378 --> 00:40:08,550
Mm-hmm.

810
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:11,969
l know it's not right
for them to try to profit

811
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,344
from my husband's death.

812
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,101
When l first realized
what was happening,

813
00:40:16,137 --> 00:40:20,032
l was in disbelief.

814
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:22,690
- lt's hurtful.
- l'm so sorry.

815
00:40:24,106 --> 00:40:25,480
Um...

816
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,329
it's hurtful and l wanted answers.

817
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,922
Moore: lrma contacted
Michael D. Myers,

818
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,349
a local attorney who had
already been looking into

819
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:39,556
these kind of corporate
insurance policies on their employees.

820
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:43,391
With the normal use of life insurance,
where you're guarding against

821
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:47,806
the loss of a loved one
or a breadwinner of the family,

822
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:52,070
you don't want that person to die.

823
00:40:52,103 --> 00:40:54,175
With these policies,
the companies that buy these

824
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:56,003
want the employees to die

825
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,625
in accordance
with the policy projections.

826
00:40:58,663 --> 00:41:02,405
You are more valuable dead
to a company than alive.

827
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:07,003
American Greetings, RR Donnelly & Sons,
and Proctor & Gamble

828
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:09,697
are all having problems
with mortality.

829
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,123
These four combined programs
are running at 50%

830
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:13,594
of expected mortality.

831
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,952
These clients are acutely aware
of this problem.

832
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:19,583
Basically here the broker
is complaining

833
00:41:19,621 --> 00:41:21,922
that not enough
employees are dying.

834
00:41:21,956 --> 00:41:25,503
And therefore the investment returns
are not matching the projections.

835
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,875
The broker writes
that NCC is running

836
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:30,494
at 78% of expected mortality.

837
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:34,242
Okay, so 78% of the people
we expected to die died.

838
00:41:34,275 --> 00:41:37,375
But the problem with that
is three of them were suicides.

839
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,452
And you can't count
on that every year.

840
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:41,434
Moore: Can you think
of any other situation

841
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:45,630
were you'd actually want
people to die?

842
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:49,692
Combatants in war, l guess.

843
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:53,375
Wow, when do you want
people to die?

844
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:54,971
l-l don't know.

845
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,653
War situations,
terrorism situations.

846
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:03,099
Drug trials, perhaps.
l don't know.

847
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:05,626
l don't know.
That's an odd question.

848
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:08,762
Moore: l didn't understand
how any of this could be legal.

849
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,518
After all, there's a reason
that there's a law

850
00:42:11,552 --> 00:42:15,775
prohibiting me from taking out
a fire insurance policy on your house

851
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:19,867
because l have a vested interest
in your house burning down.

852
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:22,903
Since Attorney Myers had been
researching this for years,

853
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:24,918
l asked him which companies
were profiting

854
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,684
from these insurance policies.

855
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,094
l don't know,
you don't know,

856
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,648
because there's no place
you can go and find out

857
00:42:30,686 --> 00:42:34,166
whether your company
is a purchaser

858
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,411
- of these types of products.
- Which ones do you know?

859
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:38,072
The ones that we know
that have slipped out are

860
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,052
Bank of America, Citibank,

861
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:43,257
Wal-Mart, Winn-Dixie,
Proctor & Gamble,

862
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,333
McDonnell Douglas, Hershey,

863
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,222
Nestle , AT&T,
Southwestern Bell,

864
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:50,228
Ameritech, American Express--

865
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:52,244
- This is blue chip you're talking about.
- Yeah.

866
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:55,351
These aren't fly-by-night companies
trying to do a scam here

867
00:42:55,389 --> 00:42:57,461
so they can collect a check
if one of their employees dies.

868
00:42:57,501 --> 00:43:00,664
There are probably
several million Americans

869
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:04,378
who are covered by one of these policies
or have been at some point.

870
00:43:04,413 --> 00:43:05,623
There's a lot of it out there.

871
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:07,733
Moore:
This is Paul Smith.

872
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:11,186
He used to be what is known
as a loyal employee.

873
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:15,286
Smith: l worked for Wal-Mart
for 18 years and l gave them 110%.

874
00:43:15,324 --> 00:43:17,014
l mean, l loved that company.

875
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,481
And as it turned out,
Wal-Mart took out

876
00:43:18,523 --> 00:43:21,458
over 350,000
life insurance policies

877
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,539
on rank and file associates.

878
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:24,724
These weren't executives.

879
00:43:24,762 --> 00:43:28,057
These were people like my wife,
a cake decorator for 18 months.

880
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:31,538
That's the type of people they were taking
insurance policies out on.

881
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:35,407
Moore: Paul's wife LaDonna
left her job at the Wal-Mart bakery

882
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:38,132
so she could be a stay-at-home mom
for her two kids.

883
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,204
Smith:
She had asthma real real bad.

884
00:43:41,242 --> 00:43:43,097
She went into
the emergency room one night

885
00:43:43,128 --> 00:43:45,016
and a nurse comes out and says,
''Are you Mr. Smith?''

886
00:43:45,048 --> 00:43:46,478
And l said, ''Yes.''

887
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:50,416
And she said, ''We don't think
your wife's gonna make it.''

888
00:43:50,456 --> 00:43:52,344
Moore:
LaDonna slipped into a coma

889
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:54,612
from which she would
never awaken.

890
00:43:54,648 --> 00:43:56,721
Her family rushed to the hospital,

891
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,094
even though there was nothing
they could do to help.

892
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:01,583
There was a wall here
and LaDonna's in the room

893
00:44:01,623 --> 00:44:02,998
on the other side of the wall.

894
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:05,202
And Jessica kept saying,
''Where is she?''

895
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:07,760
And l said, ''She's right on
the other side of that wall.''

896
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,246
And Jessica said,
''Can we cut a hole in the wall

897
00:44:11,286 --> 00:44:13,675
so that we can see her?''

898
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,661
And that just sticks with me.

899
00:44:15,702 --> 00:44:17,458
Do you remember that?

900
00:44:19,478 --> 00:44:23,668
Smith: We had to stay in there with her,
and so we'd write letters to her.

901
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:27,978
''My dear wife, l miss you more
than any words can possibly say.

902
00:44:28,021 --> 00:44:29,516
You are my life.

903
00:44:29,557 --> 00:44:31,858
You always see beauty
in the simplest things.

904
00:44:31,893 --> 00:44:36,148
l've always admired you for that.
l wish l could have told you that more.

905
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:38,351
l want you to come back
to me soon.

906
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:41,259
l still have a lot left to learn
from you, baby doll.

907
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,373
Your loving husband, Paul.''

908
00:44:45,237 --> 00:44:47,570
You okay, Wesley?

909
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,567
She was 26 years old.

910
00:44:51,603 --> 00:44:54,418
LaDonna: You're silly.
You're silly.

911
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:57,965
Myers: The younger a person is,
the higher the benefit is

912
00:44:58,003 --> 00:45:00,686
because they're expected
to live longer.

913
00:45:00,724 --> 00:45:02,829
Women are also expected
to live longer than men.

914
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,713
So the most valuable employee
to the company

915
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:08,528
if they're dead,
is a young woman.

916
00:45:08,563 --> 00:45:10,088
Moore:
LaDonna's death earned

917
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,268
one of the richest corporations
in the world

918
00:45:12,306 --> 00:45:14,760
an extra $81,000.

919
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:17,998
l was faced with over $100,000
worth of medical bills

920
00:45:18,034 --> 00:45:21,230
and a $6,000 funeral

921
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:24,581
and Wal-Mart didn't offer a penny
to help with that.

922
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,755
l did trust them.

923
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:30,925
And never in a million years
would l have ever thought

924
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,775
that somewhere
on a profit statement,

925
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:36,677
''Dead associate, $81,000.''

926
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:40,550
Wal-Mart doesn't care about you.

927
00:45:40,592 --> 00:45:42,347
When someone passes away,

928
00:45:42,384 --> 00:45:45,067
they shouldn't get
something out of it.

929
00:45:55,311 --> 00:45:57,699
Myers: The common denominator
to each form of coverage

930
00:45:57,742 --> 00:45:59,684
is that when the employee dies,

931
00:45:59,726 --> 00:46:02,826
the employer gets paid
the insurance benefits.

932
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:05,896
They're often referred to
as ''dead peasant insurance.''

933
00:46:05,934 --> 00:46:09,349
Moore: Dead peasants?
Why'd they use such a creepy name?

934
00:46:09,389 --> 00:46:12,389
Myers: lt's very creepy.
l don't know what it means either.

935
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:13,541
Dead is clear.

936
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:16,199
That's the worker who's passed away,
so they're dead.

937
00:46:16,237 --> 00:46:18,572
Peasant, l don't know why
they chose that word.

938
00:46:18,605 --> 00:46:20,547
l don't know if it has
some historical significance

939
00:46:20,588 --> 00:46:23,458
or that's just the way they view
the relative value

940
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:25,159
of the employees' lives.

941
00:46:25,197 --> 00:46:26,724
Dead peasants?

942
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:28,804
Yeah, amongst themselves
that's what they call it.

943
00:46:30,315 --> 00:46:34,375
lt's insulting to refer
to my husband like that.

944
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:36,353
( sniffles )

945
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:42,721
Moore:
lt turned out that Amegy Bank

946
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:45,349
had a second
dead peasant policy on Dan,

947
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:49,215
bringing their total take
to nearly $5 million.

948
00:46:51,947 --> 00:46:52,907
- ls capitalism a sin?
- Father Dick Preston: Yes.

949
00:46:52,907 --> 00:46:54,760
- ls capitalism a sin?
- Father Dick Preston: Yes.

950
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:57,250
Capitalism for me and for many of us

951
00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:00,485
at this present moment is an evil.

952
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:04,132
lt's contrary to all that's good.
lt's contrary to the common good.

953
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,307
lt's contrary to compassion.

954
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:09,193
lt's contrary to
all of the major religions.

955
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:13,119
Capitalism is precisely
what the holy books,

956
00:47:13,161 --> 00:47:17,632
our holy books in particular,
remind us is unjust

957
00:47:17,672 --> 00:47:20,519
and in some form and fashion,

958
00:47:20,552 --> 00:47:25,123
God will come down
and eradicate somehow.

959
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:27,396
Moore:
This was Father Dick Preston,

960
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:30,628
the priest from Flint
who married my wife and me.

961
00:47:30,664 --> 00:47:32,735
Preston:
Capitalism is wrong,

962
00:47:32,775 --> 00:47:36,353
and therefore
has to be eliminated.

963
00:47:36,391 --> 00:47:38,300
Moore:
Eliminated?

964
00:47:38,342 --> 00:47:40,253
That might be a little harsh,

965
00:47:40,295 --> 00:47:42,204
so l decided to go
and talk to the priest

966
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:44,449
that married my sister
and brother-in-law.

967
00:47:44,485 --> 00:47:46,690
l'm sure he would have
a more balanced approach

968
00:47:46,726 --> 00:47:48,766
when it came to capitalism.

969
00:47:48,806 --> 00:47:52,581
lt is immoral, it is obscene,
it is outrageous.

970
00:47:52,614 --> 00:47:55,231
You know...

971
00:47:55,269 --> 00:47:57,505
it is really radical evil.

972
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,744
lt's radically evil.

973
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,163
Moore: Wow, does their boss know
that they're talking like this?

974
00:48:03,204 --> 00:48:06,106
l thought it best to go
and check this out with the bishop.

975
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:08,320
Bishop Thomas Gumbleton:
The system doesn't seem to be

976
00:48:08,356 --> 00:48:11,967
providing for the well being
of all the people.

977
00:48:12,003 --> 00:48:14,786
And that's what makes it

978
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,186
almost in its very nature

979
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:20,994
something contrary
to Jesus who said,

980
00:48:21,027 --> 00:48:24,409
''Blessed are the poor,
woe to the rich.''

981
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:27,516
That's right out
of St. Luke's gospel.

982
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:29,759
Moore: How have we put up
with this system for so long?

983
00:48:29,795 --> 00:48:31,867
l mean, it's--
they talk about--

984
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:36,097
The system has built into it
what we call propaganda.

985
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,268
l'm in awe of propaganda--

986
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:41,153
the ability to convince people

987
00:48:41,186 --> 00:48:44,001
who are victimized
by this very system

988
00:48:44,032 --> 00:48:46,880
to support the system
and see it as good.

989
00:48:46,913 --> 00:48:50,173
We know that American capitalism
is morally right

990
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:52,280
because its chief elements--

991
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,255
private ownership,
the profit motive

992
00:48:55,297 --> 00:48:58,199
and the competitive market--
are wholesome and good.

993
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,403
They are compatible with God's laws
and the teachings of the Bible.

994
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:04,190
Moore: For as long
as l can remember,

995
00:49:04,224 --> 00:49:07,672
l've been told that competition
and profit are good things.

996
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,719
( distorted )
They are compatible with God's laws

997
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:10,871
and the teachings of the Bible.

998
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:14,106
Moore: And if increasing profits
means locking up a few kids

999
00:49:14,143 --> 00:49:16,184
or cashing in on the death
of an employee...

1000
00:49:16,222 --> 00:49:18,940
( distorted ) Compatible with God's laws
and the teachings of the Bible.

1001
00:49:18,974 --> 00:49:22,106
Moore: ...it is morally right to provide
for the stockholders.

1002
00:49:22,143 --> 00:49:24,378
( distorted )
They are compatible with God's laws

1003
00:49:24,414 --> 00:49:25,592
and the teachings of the Bible.

1004
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,728
Moore:
Debt, eviction and exploitation.

1005
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:32,081
( distorted )
God's laws and the teachings of the Bible.

1006
00:49:32,126 --> 00:49:34,940
Moore: What were we really
pledging our allegiance to?

1007
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,788
( distorted )
The profit motive.

1008
00:49:37,822 --> 00:49:40,407
Moore: And so all good Americans
came to act as if they believed

1009
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:43,478
our capitalist economic system
was compatible

1010
00:49:43,516 --> 00:49:45,753
with the teachings of the Bible.

1011
00:49:48,507 --> 00:49:51,378
( organ music playing )

1012
00:49:53,692 --> 00:49:57,369
When l was a kid,
l wanted to be a priest.

1013
00:49:57,403 --> 00:49:59,126
lt wasn't because
of the fancy getups

1014
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,333
or the Knights of Columbus
escorts,

1015
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:04,534
or even the groovy nuns
who were so good to me.

1016
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:08,913
lt was because of the priests
who went on the march from Selma,

1017
00:50:08,954 --> 00:50:11,409
or tried to stop the war,

1018
00:50:11,451 --> 00:50:14,766
or devoted their lives to the poor.

1019
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:18,606
They told me quite clearly
what Jesus said,

1020
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,840
that the first shall be last
and the last shall be first;

1021
00:50:22,873 --> 00:50:25,458
That the rich man
will have a very hard time

1022
00:50:25,496 --> 00:50:27,472
getting into heaven;

1023
00:50:27,512 --> 00:50:31,190
That we will be judged by how
we treat the least among us;

1024
00:50:31,224 --> 00:50:33,746
And that there are no people
more important to God

1025
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:36,206
than the poor.

1026
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:38,670
Since that time,
it seems that Jesus got hijacked

1027
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:41,559
by a lot of people who believe
that the son of God

1028
00:50:41,592 --> 00:50:45,782
was sent here to create
heaven on earth for the well-to-do.

1029
00:50:45,815 --> 00:50:47,920
l must have missed
that part of the Bible

1030
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,123
where Jesus became a capitalist.

1031
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:56,782
Man:
Please tell me, master,

1032
00:50:56,822 --> 00:50:59,474
what must l do
to have eternal life?

1033
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:02,893
Go forth and maximize profits.

1034
00:51:04,663 --> 00:51:07,858
You say the Kingdom of Heaven
is at hand,

1035
00:51:07,893 --> 00:51:09,356
but when exactly will it come?

1036
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:13,423
When you deregulate
the banking industry.

1037
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:16,429
- ( voices overlapping )
- Help me.

1038
00:51:16,469 --> 00:51:18,891
l've been this way for 20 years.

1039
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:24,010
l'm sorry, l cannot heal
your pre-existing condition.

1040
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,534
He'll have to pay out of pocket.

1041
00:51:30,804 --> 00:51:33,193
Moore: Somehow, l don't think
Jesus came to earth

1042
00:51:33,235 --> 00:51:36,268
so he could ring the bell
at the New York Stock Exchange.

1043
00:51:36,307 --> 00:51:38,217
And yet,
from the very beginning,

1044
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,976
the rich have claimed him
for their own.

1045
00:51:41,012 --> 00:51:44,655
When l'm on Wall Street
and l realize

1046
00:51:44,692 --> 00:51:48,652
that that's the very nerve center
of American capitalism,

1047
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:52,204
and l realize
what capitalism has done

1048
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,722
for working people in America,
to me that's a holy place.

1049
00:51:55,762 --> 00:51:56,875
Let me add to it.

1050
00:51:56,914 --> 00:52:00,775
Over the whole duration of the lraq war
and the terror war,

1051
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:04,494
you look at the world's stock markets
and you look at the world economy,

1052
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:08,326
and despite these horrible pockets
of unrest and killing and murdering

1053
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:11,150
that we've been describing,
it's never been better.

1054
00:52:11,184 --> 00:52:13,039
The global economy
has never been better

1055
00:52:13,072 --> 00:52:15,592
and the global stock markets
have never been better, Jimmy.

1056
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,574
lt is either a God-given miracle

1057
00:52:17,617 --> 00:52:19,503
or it has something to do
with the victories

1058
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,806
of the spreading world
of capitalism or both.

1059
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,695
Moore: They think
Wall Street's a holy place.

1060
00:52:23,728 --> 00:52:26,543
What do you think
Jesus would think of capitalism?

1061
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:30,766
l think he would
simply refuse to--

1062
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,903
to be part of it.

1063
00:52:35,023 --> 00:52:37,771
Moore: Jesus would refuse
to be part of it,

1064
00:52:37,806 --> 00:52:39,693
but he probably had
a special place up there

1065
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:42,541
for whoever leaked
a secret Citibank memo

1066
00:52:42,574 --> 00:52:45,804
about their plan to rule the world.

1067
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:47,746
Back in 2005 and 2006,

1068
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:50,027
Citigroup wrote
three confidential memos

1069
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:54,338
to their wealthiest investors
about how things were going.

1070
00:52:54,382 --> 00:52:56,682
They reached the conclusion
that the United States

1071
00:52:56,717 --> 00:52:58,856
was no longer
really a democracy,

1072
00:52:58,893 --> 00:53:01,543
but had become a plutonomy--

1073
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:04,547
a society controlled exclusively
by and for the benefit

1074
00:53:04,588 --> 00:53:07,556
of the top 1%
of the population

1075
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:09,603
who now had
more financial wealth

1076
00:53:09,643 --> 00:53:13,125
than the bottom 95% combined.

1077
00:53:13,164 --> 00:53:16,262
The memo gloated about the growing gap
between rich and poor

1078
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,615
and how they were now
the new aristocracy

1079
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:23,434
and that there was no end in sight
for the gravy train they were on.

1080
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:26,882
There was, though,
one problem.

1081
00:53:26,922 --> 00:53:28,385
According to Citigroup,

1082
00:53:28,427 --> 00:53:30,914
the most potent
and short-term threat

1083
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:32,677
would be societies demanding

1084
00:53:32,715 --> 00:53:35,202
a more equitable share
of the wealth.

1085
00:53:35,242 --> 00:53:39,432
ln other words,
the peasants might revolt.

1086
00:53:39,465 --> 00:53:41,735
Citigroup lamented
that the non-rich

1087
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:44,135
might not have
much economic power,

1088
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,552
but they do have
equal voting power with the rich.

1089
00:53:47,594 --> 00:53:50,440
One person, one vote.

1090
00:53:50,472 --> 00:53:53,025
And that's what
really scares them--

1091
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:55,400
that we can still vote.

1092
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:58,597
ln fact, we have
99% of the votes

1093
00:53:58,632 --> 00:54:01,315
and they only have 1%.

1094
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:08,061
So why do the 99%
put up with this?

1095
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:11,398
According to Citigroup,
it's because the majority of the electorate

1096
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:13,820
believe that someday
they will have a chance

1097
00:54:13,862 --> 00:54:16,284
of becoming
well-to-do themselves

1098
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:19,360
if they just keep trying
hard enough.

1099
00:54:21,606 --> 00:54:23,811
The wealthy were pleased
that so many people

1100
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:26,563
had bought in
to the American Dream

1101
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,532
while they, the rich,
had no intention

1102
00:54:29,574 --> 00:54:32,356
of ever sharing it with anyone.

1103
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:35,552
l think capitalism is a lot more
important than democracy.

1104
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:37,858
l'm not even a big believer
in democracy.

1105
00:54:37,893 --> 00:54:41,340
l always say that democracy is--
can be two wolves and a sheep

1106
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,974
deciding on what to have
for dinner.

1107
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:46,110
Moore: This is Stephen Moore--
no relation--

1108
00:54:46,148 --> 00:54:48,483
a columnist
and an editorial board member

1109
00:54:48,516 --> 00:54:50,206
of ''The Wall Street Journal,''

1110
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:53,539
the daily bible
of corporate America.

1111
00:54:53,572 --> 00:54:56,507
Look, l'm in favor of people
having the right to vote

1112
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:58,914
and things like that, but you know
there are a lot of countries

1113
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:02,657
that have the right to vote
that are still poor.

1114
00:55:02,692 --> 00:55:05,920
Democracy doesn't always lead
to a good economy

1115
00:55:05,954 --> 00:55:07,809
or even a good political system.

1116
00:55:07,844 --> 00:55:11,072
With capitalism, you are free
to do what you want,

1117
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:13,081
to make whatever you want
out of yourself.

1118
00:55:13,123 --> 00:55:14,583
lt doesn't mean
you're gonna succeed.

1119
00:55:14,626 --> 00:55:18,849
Remember, the US Constitution
does not guarantee happiness.

1120
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,402
Moore:
Ah, the Constitution.

1121
00:55:21,442 --> 00:55:25,052
All my life l've heard that America
is a capitalist country.

1122
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:29,181
So l went to see the original Constitution
and check out if it was true.

1123
00:55:29,217 --> 00:55:32,512
l'm trying to see where it sets up
our economic system,

1124
00:55:32,545 --> 00:55:35,643
like where it says we have
a capitalist economy.

1125
00:55:35,681 --> 00:55:37,753
Guard:
The jurisdiction.

1126
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,516
- Judicial part of the--
- Down there?

1127
00:55:39,552 --> 00:55:43,197
Moore: There was no mention
of free market or free enterprise

1128
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:45,719
or capitalism anywhere.

1129
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:49,851
ln fact, all l saw
was ''We the people,''

1130
00:55:49,887 --> 00:55:52,375
something about
''a more perfect union,''

1131
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:55,643
and ''promoting
the general welfare.''

1132
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,989
Welfare, union, we?

1133
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,333
That sounded like that other -ism.

1134
00:56:02,365 --> 00:56:05,661
But no, that's democracy.

1135
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,326
And l began to wonder,
''What would it be like

1136
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:08,307
And l began to wonder,
''What would it be like

1137
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:11,547
if the workplace
was a democracy?''

1138
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:14,777
There's always been a big separation
between how the country is run

1139
00:56:14,813 --> 00:56:17,911
and how businesses
are supposed to run.

1140
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:19,094
Moore:
lt's true.

1141
00:56:19,134 --> 00:56:20,922
There seems to be a disconnect

1142
00:56:20,956 --> 00:56:23,193
between our professed love
of democracy

1143
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,130
and how we're so willing
to accept a dictatorship

1144
00:56:26,172 --> 00:56:28,922
every day we show up to work.

1145
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:32,601
lt's not that way
at lsthmus Engineering in Wisconsin.

1146
00:56:32,635 --> 00:56:36,313
They design and build
robotic machines for industry.

1147
00:56:36,347 --> 00:56:39,382
lt's a $15 million-a-year business.

1148
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,143
Man:
All of the workers

1149
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:44,376
are the owners of the business.

1150
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:47,826
Moore: He's not talking about
some bullshit stock option.

1151
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:51,128
He means they're the true owners.

1152
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:53,880
Man: And it's a democratically-run
operation where every member

1153
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:56,762
has one vote and an equal say.

1154
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:58,965
- All in favor?
- All in favor?

1155
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:01,903
Man: lt takes the money
out of the equation.

1156
00:57:01,945 --> 00:57:03,887
Moore: By taking the money
out of the equation

1157
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:06,068
so that they can call the shots,

1158
00:57:06,106 --> 00:57:08,342
they end up making more money.

1159
00:57:08,378 --> 00:57:10,898
Cool, huh?

1160
00:57:14,425 --> 00:57:17,108
And how patriotic
that they want to extend

1161
00:57:17,144 --> 00:57:20,820
their love of American democracy
to their job.

1162
00:57:26,871 --> 00:57:28,726
Just imagine if the place
where you worked

1163
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,793
was run by you
and your fellow workers.

1164
00:57:31,831 --> 00:57:33,621
You probably wouldn't
lay off your coworkers

1165
00:57:33,655 --> 00:57:36,471
to increase the value
of your stock, would you?

1166
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:37,909
Or give yourself
a pay raise

1167
00:57:37,943 --> 00:57:40,693
while making your coworkers
take a pay cut.

1168
00:57:40,726 --> 00:57:42,516
Man:
We don't really do that here.

1169
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:45,998
You really can't because everyone else
would be looking at you

1170
00:57:46,038 --> 00:57:48,492
saying, ''Why is this guy
so fricking greedy?''

1171
00:57:48,534 --> 00:57:51,021
You know,
it would be too obvious.

1172
00:57:51,061 --> 00:57:52,851
The bottom line is you've
got plenty of people

1173
00:57:52,885 --> 00:57:54,608
who roll up their sleeves
every day and go to work.

1174
00:57:54,646 --> 00:57:56,467
But if there's someone
way up there on the chain

1175
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:59,402
that collects all the extra money,
that's not fair.

1176
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:03,056
Moore:
Huh, fairness in the workplace--

1177
00:58:03,092 --> 00:58:05,329
what a novel idea.

1178
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:09,806
Out in California,
there's a bread factory

1179
00:58:09,844 --> 00:58:13,259
where workers make thousands
of loaves of bread every day

1180
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,210
Man:
The more hours you work towards

1181
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:16,496
the benefit
of the co-op,

1182
00:58:16,532 --> 00:58:19,282
the more you share
in the profits.

1183
00:58:19,315 --> 00:58:21,420
Man #2:
The workers are happy here.

1184
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:23,826
No big ls, little yous.
Everyone's the same.

1185
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:27,208
Me as the CEO,
l get the same share

1186
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:29,193
that anybody else does.

1187
00:58:29,235 --> 00:58:30,958
And that has proven

1188
00:58:30,994 --> 00:58:33,231
to be very lucrative
for us as workers.

1189
00:58:34,994 --> 00:58:39,369
Moore: Assembly-line workers here
earn over $65,000 a year,

1190
00:58:39,409 --> 00:58:41,416
more than
three times the pay

1191
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:43,914
for a starting pilot
at American Eagle.

1192
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:46,637
Man: l'm just hoping
that people take notice

1193
00:58:46,673 --> 00:58:48,746
of this type
of organizational activity

1194
00:58:48,784 --> 00:58:52,047
and start considering it
as an alternative.

1195
00:58:52,081 --> 00:58:53,358
Why do you want
to get rich?

1196
00:58:53,393 --> 00:58:55,248
How many cars do
you really need in life?

1197
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,688
Moore: Clearly, he's not a car guy,
but that's okay.

1198
00:58:59,728 --> 00:59:03,110
His bread factory and hundreds of other
worker-owned businesses

1199
00:59:03,152 --> 00:59:06,599
are proof that people aren't always
motivated by profit.

1200
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:09,322
( fanfare )

1201
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,880
Announcer:
An historic victory over a dread disease.

1202
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,148
Moore: lnstead of using his genius
to make a ton of money,

1203
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:18,315
Dr. Jonas Salk spent
all of his time

1204
00:59:18,351 --> 00:59:20,739
putting monkey kidneys
in a blender

1205
00:59:20,782 --> 00:59:22,757
trying to find a cure
for polio.

1206
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:27,467
And when he did,
he decided to give it away for free.

1207
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:30,436
This man could have been rich
many times over

1208
00:59:30,478 --> 00:59:33,673
had he sold his vaccine
to a pharmaceutical company.

1209
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:36,043
But he thought
his talents should be used

1210
00:59:36,077 --> 00:59:37,222
for the greater good.

1211
00:59:37,262 --> 00:59:40,076
And the decent salary
he made as a doctor

1212
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,411
and a research professor
was enough for him to live

1213
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:44,418
a comfortable life.

1214
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,762
Who owns the patent
on this vaccine?

1215
00:59:46,797 --> 00:59:48,684
Well, the people,
l would say.

1216
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:52,130
There is no patent.
Would you patent the sun?

1217
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:55,849
Moore: Yes, we've come a long way
since the days of Dr. Salk.

1218
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:59,844
Because today our best minds
are used for something else.

1219
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:00,619
Where do we send our top
math and science people?

1220
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:03,751
Where do we send our top
math and science people?

1221
01:00:03,788 --> 01:00:05,063
lnto finance.

1222
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:07,465
They don't go into
science in America.

1223
01:00:07,498 --> 01:00:10,083
They go to Wall Street.

1224
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:13,057
Moore: Today's students,
unlike in Dr. Salk's time,

1225
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:15,554
can graduate from college
with a student loan debt

1226
01:00:15,594 --> 01:00:18,496
of up to $100,000 or more.

1227
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:20,742
These students are then
beholden to the banks

1228
01:00:20,778 --> 01:00:23,626
for the next 20 years.

1229
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:26,375
And the best way for them
to pay off these banks

1230
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:28,264
is to go to work for them

1231
01:00:28,297 --> 01:00:30,818
instead of working
for the common good.

1232
01:00:30,856 --> 01:00:35,047
Black: We've taken people that could
be enormously productive--

1233
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:36,641
just what we're short of
in America--

1234
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:39,583
and we take them and we
put them in an activity

1235
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:41,534
that isn't simply less
productive,

1236
01:00:41,577 --> 01:00:44,260
but where they're
actually destructive;

1237
01:00:44,295 --> 01:00:47,940
where actually every day they work,
they make the world worse.

1238
01:00:47,976 --> 01:00:50,909
Moore: So what exactly were the top
students from Harvard

1239
01:00:50,952 --> 01:00:52,860
and other schools
working on these days?

1240
01:00:52,903 --> 01:00:54,846
Derivatives... derivatives...
derivatives... derivatives...

1241
01:00:54,887 --> 01:00:57,190
Credit default swaps.

1242
01:00:57,222 --> 01:00:59,164
l can't make any sense
out of this.

1243
01:00:59,206 --> 01:01:00,898
l might as well quit.

1244
01:01:00,934 --> 01:01:02,757
Moore:
That's exactly how l felt

1245
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:04,862
when l started hearing
these new terms.

1246
01:01:04,902 --> 01:01:08,862
So l went down to the New York Stock
Exchange to get some answers.

1247
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:10,559
Sir, can you explain
derivatives to me?

1248
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:12,737
Can anybody explain
derivatives or credit default swaps?

1249
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:13,951
Can someone explain
to me what these are?

1250
01:01:13,989 --> 01:01:16,128
Sir, can you tell me what
a credit default swap is?

1251
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:17,626
Can you explain
a derivative to me?

1252
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,077
Can you tell me
what a derivative is?

1253
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,280
- Nobody'll talk to me.
- l'm just a blue-collar guy.

1254
01:01:21,317 --> 01:01:22,909
l can see that.
Hey.

1255
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:25,371
- l'm looking for some advice.
- Yeah, good.

1256
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:28,413
You guys got any
advice for me here?

1257
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,362
A derivative?
Credit default swap?

1258
01:01:30,405 --> 01:01:31,811
( sighs )

1259
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:34,266
Moore:
l did find one guy on Wall Street

1260
01:01:34,307 --> 01:01:36,063
who wasn't a film critic.

1261
01:01:36,101 --> 01:01:39,329
Marcus Haupt is an lvy League
educated engineer

1262
01:01:39,364 --> 01:01:41,884
who was a vice president
of Lehman Brothers

1263
01:01:41,923 --> 01:01:44,313
and spent 15 years
on Wall Street

1264
01:01:44,355 --> 01:01:47,257
creating what they call
complex financial instruments.

1265
01:01:47,298 --> 01:01:48,728
What is a derivative?

1266
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,777
A derivative
is a secondary bet

1267
01:01:50,818 --> 01:01:52,541
on an underlying product.

1268
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:54,521
So you may have a stock
and you have an option on that stock.

1269
01:01:54,563 --> 01:01:57,661
And that option on that stock
allows you the privilege

1270
01:01:57,697 --> 01:01:59,967
but not the obligation
to buy or sell.

1271
01:02:00,003 --> 01:02:02,905
How should we put this?
You are allowed to make a decision

1272
01:02:02,945 --> 01:02:05,335
of whether or not you want to ultimately
take that exposure.

1273
01:02:05,378 --> 01:02:07,833
Let me explain it another way.
The derivative's price

1274
01:02:07,873 --> 01:02:09,782
is based on the price
of something else.

1275
01:02:09,824 --> 01:02:11,679
lt's kind of like
a second-degree equation.

1276
01:02:11,713 --> 01:02:14,331
lf you think of,
let's say...

1277
01:02:14,369 --> 01:02:17,664
um, maybe l should go back.

1278
01:02:17,697 --> 01:02:19,768
Let me start this over again.
Let's go back here.

1279
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,288
Moore:
l was lost.

1280
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:25,914
Maybe there's someone
at Harvard University

1281
01:02:25,952 --> 01:02:27,512
who could explain it to me.

1282
01:02:27,552 --> 01:02:29,885
Yeah, the-- the-- the--

1283
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,735
the-- the-- the--
the buyer--

1284
01:02:32,768 --> 01:02:35,800
so the seller holds the loan
and it might default.

1285
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:38,905
And they sell off--

1286
01:02:38,943 --> 01:02:41,594
somebody-- somebody else--

1287
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:44,478
Sorry, let me just back up.

1288
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:48,056
l apologize.
These are pretty exotic.

1289
01:02:48,094 --> 01:02:50,036
Moore:
Derivatives are nothing more

1290
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,217
than complicated
betting schemes.

1291
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:55,068
Here's what the math equation
of one looks like.

1292
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:56,858
Can't figure it out?

1293
01:02:56,893 --> 01:02:59,282
That's okay.
You're not supposed to.

1294
01:02:59,324 --> 01:03:01,496
They've made them
purposely confusing

1295
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:03,507
so they can get away
with murder.

1296
01:03:03,548 --> 01:03:05,436
Let's say you're a lawyer
and you're coming in

1297
01:03:05,469 --> 01:03:07,224
and you're from the government
and you're trying to evaluate

1298
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,648
if these things
violate the tax code or not.

1299
01:03:09,693 --> 01:03:11,514
lf you can figure out
what they're doing,

1300
01:03:11,548 --> 01:03:13,784
most likely that Wall Street
firm will offer you a job.

1301
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:17,202
Could l go to Wall Street
and just ask them

1302
01:03:17,244 --> 01:03:19,251
to set up a derivative
on anything?

1303
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:20,632
Yes.

1304
01:03:20,668 --> 01:03:22,074
Believe me,
if it's out there

1305
01:03:22,108 --> 01:03:23,635
there's a derivative on it.

1306
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:26,065
Moore:
So this is what Wall Street has come to--

1307
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:28,474
an insane casino.

1308
01:03:28,507 --> 01:03:30,896
We've allowed them
to bet on anything,

1309
01:03:30,938 --> 01:03:34,043
including our family home.

1310
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:42,744
Reporter #1 : ...the most powerful central
banker of the 20th century.

1311
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,949
Reporter #2:
Greenspan has become an economic icon.

1312
01:03:44,985 --> 01:03:48,085
Reporter #3: Alan Greenspan says
the economy is hunky-dory.

1313
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:50,423
Reporter #4: Greenspan gone wild.
lt's like ''Girls Gone Wild.''

1314
01:03:50,456 --> 01:03:53,206
What do Mick Jagger
and Alan Greenspan have in common?

1315
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,371
Alan Greenspan,
who at that moment in time

1316
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:58,514
was surely thought to be
the smartest man

1317
01:03:58,552 --> 01:04:00,242
who had walked the face
of the earth,

1318
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,280
he starts using a phrase,
''tap your home equity,''

1319
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,038
--that Americans can tap
their home equity,

1320
01:04:06,072 --> 01:04:08,210
which is just
Alan Greenspan-speak

1321
01:04:08,248 --> 01:04:11,063
for ''borrow against
your home.''

1322
01:04:11,096 --> 01:04:13,201
And if you can't repay it
you'll lose your house.

1323
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:17,231
lt actually started by talking
mostly older Americans,

1324
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:18,733
people who already
had homes,

1325
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:21,525
into refinancing
their homes

1326
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:23,250
to get them out of houses.

1327
01:04:23,286 --> 01:04:26,963
Moore: Yes, get senior citizens
out of their houses.

1328
01:04:26,998 --> 01:04:29,867
The scam to swindle people
out of the homes

1329
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:32,780
they already owned
was masterful.

1330
01:04:32,822 --> 01:04:35,244
Here's how it worked.

1331
01:04:35,286 --> 01:04:38,798
First, tell these homeowners
that they own a bank.

1332
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:41,684
And that bank is your home.

1333
01:04:41,717 --> 01:04:45,295
So if your home
is worth $250,000,

1334
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:48,266
that makes you
a quarter millionaire.

1335
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:50,577
You're sitting
on a goldmine.

1336
01:04:50,612 --> 01:04:53,394
You own your own bank.

1337
01:04:53,429 --> 01:04:55,632
The bank of you.

1338
01:04:55,668 --> 01:04:58,898
And you can use your bank
to get more money.

1339
01:04:58,931 --> 01:05:00,338
Just refinance.

1340
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:01,998
Everyone's doing it.

1341
01:05:02,036 --> 01:05:05,199
Of course hidden in the dozens
or hundreds of pages of fine print

1342
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,405
are tricky clauses that allow the bank
to raise your interest rate

1343
01:05:07,443 --> 01:05:09,036
to a number
you didn't know about,

1344
01:05:09,074 --> 01:05:11,016
perhaps so high that you won't
be able to repay your loan.

1345
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:12,717
But that's okay.

1346
01:05:12,755 --> 01:05:16,070
lf you can't pay it
we'll just take your house.

1347
01:05:18,483 --> 01:05:20,719
Of course, before they
could take your house

1348
01:05:20,753 --> 01:05:23,601
they needed to change
the regulations and the rules.

1349
01:05:23,634 --> 01:05:26,351
Moore:
What's this photo l found here?

1350
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:28,905
lt was in an annual
report of the FDlC.

1351
01:05:28,945 --> 01:05:33,255
John Gilleran, the head of the Office
of Thrift Supervision,

1352
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:34,759
which is supposed to regulate
savings and loans,

1353
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,005
he's the guy
with the chainsaw.

1354
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:39,309
And the four other
grinning idiots

1355
01:05:39,344 --> 01:05:43,686
in the photo are the three
leading lobbyists in banking

1356
01:05:43,728 --> 01:05:47,525
and the deputy director of the Federal
Deposit lnsurance Corporation.

1357
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:51,364
And they're poised over
a pile of regulations.

1358
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:53,097
And this is supposed
to demonstrate

1359
01:05:53,135 --> 01:05:56,103
their intention
to destroy regulation.

1360
01:05:56,143 --> 01:05:58,510
And they succeeded.

1361
01:05:58,543 --> 01:06:00,331
And now we know what happens

1362
01:06:00,367 --> 01:06:02,407
when you destroy
financial regulation.

1363
01:06:02,447 --> 01:06:04,715
You produce a financial
catastrophe.

1364
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:07,271
A growing family
with a lot of debt;

1365
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:09,382
A young couple
with no down payment;

1366
01:06:09,422 --> 01:06:12,324
A business owner whose
income was hard to document;

1367
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:15,213
Every one of them was
turned down for a home loan

1368
01:06:15,246 --> 01:06:16,740
by three different lenders.

1369
01:06:16,782 --> 01:06:19,913
l'm with Countrywide
and l got them all approved.

1370
01:06:19,949 --> 01:06:22,818
Moore:
Don't be fooled by the pleasant demeanor

1371
01:06:22,862 --> 01:06:24,454
and blonde hair.

1372
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:26,795
lt's the same pitch
the mafia gives you

1373
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:28,552
in the neighborhood.

1374
01:06:28,588 --> 01:06:30,050
( imitating Brando )
l know how you feel.

1375
01:06:30,092 --> 01:06:32,001
You got a lot of debt.

1376
01:06:32,045 --> 01:06:34,117
You don't have any money
for the down payment.

1377
01:06:34,155 --> 01:06:36,425
You can't find
your documents.

1378
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,527
lt's okay.
l'll make you a loan you can't refuse.

1379
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:41,351
lt's called subprime.

1380
01:06:41,387 --> 01:06:43,592
You pay no interest now.

1381
01:06:43,628 --> 01:06:45,831
You pay a little more later.

1382
01:06:45,867 --> 01:06:49,182
Don't worry about later.
We'll take care of you.

1383
01:06:49,226 --> 01:06:52,260
And like the mafia,
Countrywide,

1384
01:06:52,298 --> 01:06:55,778
Citibank, Wells Fargo,
Chase...

1385
01:06:55,818 --> 01:06:57,543
Let's go.

1386
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:59,913
...they would someday
stop by to collect

1387
01:06:59,947 --> 01:07:02,663
and take your home.

1388
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:08,418
Randy Hacker:
l was paying 1,700 a month and making it.

1389
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:10,978
Then it went to 2,000.
Then it went to 2,300.

1390
01:07:11,018 --> 01:07:13,025
Then it went to 2,700.

1391
01:07:13,065 --> 01:07:14,920
Can't do it.

1392
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:22,431
Moore: These are the Hackers
of Peoria, lllinois.

1393
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,960
Randy is a railroad worker

1394
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:27,650
and Donna works
for retirement homes.

1395
01:07:27,688 --> 01:07:31,398
Their farm, which had
been in the family for over four decades,

1396
01:07:31,431 --> 01:07:34,661
had been foreclosed
on by Citibank.

1397
01:07:34,695 --> 01:07:37,378
Randy had had an accident
on the job years ago

1398
01:07:37,414 --> 01:07:39,106
and was now
on disability.

1399
01:07:41,606 --> 01:07:46,079
They absolutely just plain
fucking stole everything,

1400
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:48,027
my whole life's savings
and everything,

1401
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:51,780
by a stroke of a pen
and a lawyer and a judge.

1402
01:07:51,813 --> 01:07:55,010
Moore: The Hackers showed me
the foreclosure notice from Citibank.

1403
01:07:55,045 --> 01:07:56,606
What caught my eye

1404
01:07:56,646 --> 01:07:59,264
was the town from which
their mortgage came.

1405
01:07:59,302 --> 01:08:02,782
lt turns out that a company
owned by the big banks

1406
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:05,635
has chosen to run
60 million mortgages through,

1407
01:08:05,668 --> 01:08:08,833
of all places, one of
the most desperate towns

1408
01:08:08,869 --> 01:08:10,461
in the United States.

1409
01:08:10,501 --> 01:08:12,867
This company hires
the people of Flint

1410
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,170
to send out nearly 60%

1411
01:08:15,204 --> 01:08:18,368
of all the foreclosure
notices in the country.

1412
01:08:18,404 --> 01:08:21,502
ln what seems to be some
sort of cruel joke,

1413
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:23,907
my hometown was now
in the service

1414
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:26,274
of helping to turn
the rest of America

1415
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:28,346
into Flint.

1416
01:08:32,418 --> 01:08:35,287
Typically when a bank forces
a family like the Hackers

1417
01:08:35,331 --> 01:08:37,884
out of their home
they hire professionals

1418
01:08:37,922 --> 01:08:39,613
to come and clean up
the place.

1419
01:08:40,994 --> 01:08:43,166
ln this case,
the bank figured,

1420
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:46,779
why pay top dollar when
we've got a desperate family

1421
01:08:46,818 --> 01:08:48,759
who will work cheap?

1422
01:08:48,801 --> 01:08:50,841
ln a final humiliation

1423
01:08:50,881 --> 01:08:52,987
the Hackers went
to work for the bank

1424
01:08:53,025 --> 01:08:54,814
that took their home.

1425
01:08:56,704 --> 01:08:59,323
Donna: ''Property is to be turned over
in broom-clean condition

1426
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:02,175
with all trash, debris
and personal property removed.

1427
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:05,823
Upon delivery of the keys

1428
01:09:05,856 --> 01:09:09,304
the PAS representative will
hand you a check for $1,000.''

1429
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,784
Randy:
You know, 1,000 bucks

1430
01:09:17,823 --> 01:09:21,118
to get out
of my own house and stuff,

1431
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:24,086
l really want to thank them.
That was really something.

1432
01:09:24,127 --> 01:09:26,778
My wife worked for a week
to clean the house up

1433
01:09:26,814 --> 01:09:28,854
and make sure it was
presentable to somebody else.

1434
01:09:28,895 --> 01:09:31,414
l'm glad they did that.
l have to thank them.

1435
01:09:31,454 --> 01:09:33,341
lt was awful nice of them.

1436
01:09:33,373 --> 01:09:35,992
Yeah, l'd like to
thank them all right.

1437
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:47,125
l have one more.

1438
01:09:49,372 --> 01:09:51,990
Oh, that goes to
our bedroom door.

1439
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:54,003
Trying to think what--

1440
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:56,248
that goes that that.
l had a lock on it

1441
01:09:56,284 --> 01:09:58,106
to keep kids out
'cause l have guns.

1442
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,377
And here's
your money, Randy.

1443
01:10:00,412 --> 01:10:02,899
Moore:
What you're witnessing

1444
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:04,402
is a robbery.

1445
01:10:05,787 --> 01:10:09,136
l'm starting to understand
why people,

1446
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:11,829
they lose their minds
and start shooting people.

1447
01:10:11,867 --> 01:10:14,288
l'm not gonna say l would
do something like that,

1448
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:16,752
but l can see how
they get people

1449
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,899
into that situation where

1450
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:22,255
people go in there with bombs
and blow them up

1451
01:10:22,298 --> 01:10:24,153
and shoot at them.

1452
01:10:24,185 --> 01:10:26,193
Anything that happens to them
people, they deserve it,

1453
01:10:26,234 --> 01:10:27,925
is all l can say.

1454
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:30,067
l hope something happens--

1455
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:33,171
yeah, well.

1456
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:35,381
Can't say no more.

1457
01:10:39,896 --> 01:10:41,936
Some roadkill right there.

1458
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:43,635
Moore:
This is Bob Feinberg.

1459
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:47,284
He handled all the VlP loans
for Countrywide,

1460
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:51,095
the nation's largest
mortgage company.

1461
01:10:51,127 --> 01:10:52,983
Although Countrywide
mainly specializes

1462
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:56,278
in outrageously high interest
loans for low income people,

1463
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:58,515
Bob's job was to take care of

1464
01:10:58,551 --> 01:11:02,162
some of the country's
top political leaders.

1465
01:11:02,198 --> 01:11:04,686
Bob: One day one of the bigger
bosses called me in the office.

1466
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:06,385
He said, ''l want you
to call this guy.''

1467
01:11:06,422 --> 01:11:08,310
l said okay.

1468
01:11:08,342 --> 01:11:11,157
And he said,
''He's a friend of Angelo's.''

1469
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,556
Angelo Mozilo's the CEO
of Countrywide.

1470
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:17,582
''Give him this rate.
Waive these fees.

1471
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:21,484
And get it locked in.
And don't fuck it up.''

1472
01:11:21,524 --> 01:11:24,176
And l was like,
''Oh, okay.''

1473
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,373
So it was
a special department

1474
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:29,934
that handled friends
of Angelo.

1475
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:32,659
Discounts were being given.

1476
01:11:32,693 --> 01:11:34,219
Fees were being waived.

1477
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:37,162
And at times paperwork
was being waived.

1478
01:11:37,204 --> 01:11:41,131
We literally would
write on the file ''FOA.''

1479
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:43,789
These were really
important people.

1480
01:11:43,828 --> 01:11:46,412
l had Richard Holbrooke--
Ambassador Holbrooke,

1481
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:48,556
Donna Shalala,

1482
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:51,628
people on Capitol Hill, people that
regulate the mortgage markets,

1483
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:53,838
people that regulate
Wall Street,

1484
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:56,974
and Jim Johnson,
head of Fannie Mae,

1485
01:11:57,011 --> 01:11:59,760
Alphonso Jackson
the secretary of HUD...

1486
01:12:01,298 --> 01:12:04,167
Senator Conrad from
the Finance Committee.

1487
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:07,112
l had the TV on in my house.
l was in the kitchen

1488
01:12:07,154 --> 01:12:09,259
and l heard a voice
pontificating

1489
01:12:09,297 --> 01:12:12,015
about predatory lending
and how we have to put an end to it.

1490
01:12:12,048 --> 01:12:14,220
Our nation's financial regulators

1491
01:12:14,257 --> 01:12:15,916
are supposed to
be the cops on the beat

1492
01:12:15,953 --> 01:12:18,255
protecting working Americans

1493
01:12:18,288 --> 01:12:19,947
from unscrupulous
financial actions.

1494
01:12:19,984 --> 01:12:22,569
Bob: Senator Dodd--
Christopher Dodd-- was speaking.

1495
01:12:22,609 --> 01:12:26,121
And l just stared at
the television and l was upset.

1496
01:12:26,161 --> 01:12:28,582
Some of these loans
have legitimate uses,

1497
01:12:28,623 --> 01:12:30,565
when made to sophisticated
borrowers

1498
01:12:30,608 --> 01:12:32,648
with higher incomes.

1499
01:12:32,688 --> 01:12:35,274
l had done a number
of loans for him

1500
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:37,930
in which he got discounts
and all the things

1501
01:12:37,966 --> 01:12:39,658
that go with being
a friend of Angelo's

1502
01:12:39,694 --> 01:12:41,157
and all the good stuff.

1503
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:43,086
Moore: The Senate Banking
and Housing Committee

1504
01:12:43,118 --> 01:12:45,639
is supposed to be the watchdog
of the mortgage industry.

1505
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,810
Senator Dodd is the chairman
of this committee

1506
01:12:48,846 --> 01:12:51,367
and has served on it
for over 28 years.

1507
01:12:51,405 --> 01:12:53,545
As a friend of Angelo

1508
01:12:53,582 --> 01:12:56,167
he received
over $1 million worth

1509
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:58,693
of discounted loans
from Countrywide.

1510
01:12:58,734 --> 01:13:02,345
Someone next door here
is selling a toxic

1511
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:04,520
piece of crap
loan to somebody.

1512
01:13:04,557 --> 01:13:08,234
l was required to give the most
suitable loan to that VlP.

1513
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:10,057
Moore:
Did you ever feel that

1514
01:13:10,092 --> 01:13:12,100
what you were doing
might be bribery?

1515
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:14,988
Bob: l didn't feel like l was
bribing anybody, no.

1516
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,337
l was just doing my job.
l was the VlP guy.

1517
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,037
Everyone in the company
knew who l was.

1518
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:21,668
You know, everyone.

1519
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:24,163
So it was kind of
a flattering situation.

1520
01:13:24,203 --> 01:13:27,552
But no, l don't feel like l did
anything wrong at all.

1521
01:13:27,595 --> 01:13:30,529
And if l didn't do it, somebody else
would have been doing it.

1522
01:13:32,331 --> 01:13:34,752
Moore:
That's why we need people like Bill Black,

1523
01:13:34,795 --> 01:13:36,867
one of the bank regulators
who uncovered

1524
01:13:36,907 --> 01:13:39,046
the Savings & Loan scandal
in the 1980s.

1525
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,122
Something improper happened

1526
01:13:41,162 --> 01:13:43,365
and l bet you
the regulators know.

1527
01:13:43,402 --> 01:13:46,216
Moore: One of the leading figures of
that scandal, Charles Keating,

1528
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:48,934
had an idea on what to do
with Bill Black

1529
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:51,359
and sent a memo out
with these instructions.

1530
01:13:52,488 --> 01:13:55,390
l asked him who was
looking out for us today.

1531
01:13:55,434 --> 01:13:57,953
Where was the FBl
in all of this?

1532
01:13:57,993 --> 01:14:00,610
The FBl began
publicly warning

1533
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:03,037
in September 2004

1534
01:14:03,081 --> 01:14:06,180
that there was an epidemic
of mortgage fraud

1535
01:14:06,216 --> 01:14:08,322
perpetrated by the banks.

1536
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:09,953
Epidemic was their word.

1537
01:14:09,993 --> 01:14:12,578
But when 9/11 hit,

1538
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:15,715
the Bush administration
transferred

1539
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:19,645
at least 500 white-collar
FBl specialists

1540
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:22,371
out of dealing
with white-collar crime,

1541
01:14:22,407 --> 01:14:24,740
even though we were entering

1542
01:14:24,774 --> 01:14:26,662
during the entire
Bush administration

1543
01:14:26,694 --> 01:14:29,149
the greatest wave
of white-collar crime

1544
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:32,573
in the nation's history,
in fact, in the world's history.

1545
01:14:32,613 --> 01:14:35,680
The FBl says that 80%

1546
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:37,627
of the mortgage
fraud losses

1547
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:40,386
are induced
by lender personnel.

1548
01:14:40,421 --> 01:14:41,666
Meaning what?

1549
01:14:41,702 --> 01:14:44,036
Meaning not the borrower

1550
01:14:44,069 --> 01:14:47,069
coming off the street trying
to defraud the savings and loan.

1551
01:14:47,109 --> 01:14:50,819
These are frauds led by whoever
controls the organization.

1552
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:53,405
- Right.
- lt's typically the CEO in other words.

1553
01:14:53,444 --> 01:14:56,346
So did these CEOs
think they were gonna get away with it?

1554
01:14:56,387 --> 01:14:58,461
They have gotten
away with it.

1555
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,106
Moore:
Yes, apparently they did.

1556
01:15:02,148 --> 01:15:04,797
And with the presidential
election just around the corner...

1557
01:15:04,836 --> 01:15:07,966
- Define rich.
- 5 million.

1558
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:11,648
...the elites were worried that their crime
spree might come to an end.

1559
01:15:11,684 --> 01:15:14,716
After bilking trillions
from the American public

1560
01:15:14,755 --> 01:15:16,314
by repossessing their homes,

1561
01:15:16,354 --> 01:15:18,525
bankrupting them
when they got sick

1562
01:15:18,563 --> 01:15:20,734
and convincing them
to invest their earnings

1563
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:23,934
and pensions in the casino
known as the stock market,

1564
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:27,231
the rich decided to make
one last heist

1565
01:15:27,265 --> 01:15:30,494
and as their 30-year long
party came to an end,

1566
01:15:30,529 --> 01:15:33,878
take as much of the silverware
with them as they could.

1567
01:15:33,921 --> 01:15:36,639
But first they needed
a distraction.

1568
01:15:36,672 --> 01:15:39,804
And as they learned
after 9/11,

1569
01:15:39,841 --> 01:15:42,490
nothing works better
in the home of the brave

1570
01:15:42,529 --> 01:15:45,398
than some good old
fashioned fear.

1571
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:49,118
And who better to wheel out
for one last scary performance

1572
01:15:49,152 --> 01:15:51,966
than Chicken Little himself?

1573
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,349
Oscar voters,
for your consideration.

1574
01:15:55,391 --> 01:15:56,984
Good evening.

1575
01:15:57,024 --> 01:15:59,444
This is an extraordinary period
for America's economy.

1576
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:02,007
The government's
top economic experts

1577
01:16:02,047 --> 01:16:04,219
warn that without immediate
action by Congress,

1578
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:07,123
America could slip into
a financial panic

1579
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:10,134
and a distressing scenario
would unfold.

1580
01:16:10,175 --> 01:16:13,435
More banks could fail,
including some in your community.

1581
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:15,859
- ( thunder rumbling )
- The stock market would drop even more,

1582
01:16:15,903 --> 01:16:18,171
which would reduce the value
of your retirement account.

1583
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:20,759
The value of your home
could plummet.

1584
01:16:20,797 --> 01:16:23,186
Foreclosures would
rise dramatically.

1585
01:16:23,229 --> 01:16:25,368
And if you own
a business or a farm,

1586
01:16:25,405 --> 01:16:27,926
you would find it harder
and more expensive to get credit.

1587
01:16:27,965 --> 01:16:30,518
More businesses
would close their doors

1588
01:16:30,557 --> 01:16:33,012
and millions of Americans
could lose their jobs.

1589
01:16:33,052 --> 01:16:35,735
- ( screams )
- Even if you have good credit history,

1590
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:38,554
it would be more difficult for
you to get the loans you need

1591
01:16:38,588 --> 01:16:40,792
to buy a car or send
your children to college.

1592
01:16:40,828 --> 01:16:43,162
And ultimately our country
could experience

1593
01:16:43,195 --> 01:16:45,845
- a long and painful recession.
- ( people screaming )

1594
01:16:45,884 --> 01:16:49,844
Fellow citizens,
we must not let this happen.

1595
01:16:49,884 --> 01:16:53,331
Moore: ln reality there was no
need for this speech,

1596
01:16:53,371 --> 01:16:55,377
because the mainstream media

1597
01:16:55,418 --> 01:16:57,595
had already drunk
the Kool-Aid.

1598
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:01,109
Meltdown.
The American financial system

1599
01:17:01,146 --> 01:17:02,640
is rocked to its foundation.

1600
01:17:02,682 --> 01:17:04,918
The giant bank crumbles,
stocks plummet.

1601
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:08,182
- Nightmare on Wall Street.
- AlG fights for its life.

1602
01:17:08,217 --> 01:17:10,073
- Blood on the floor.
- Armageddon.

1603
01:17:10,105 --> 01:17:13,105
A category-five test
of our financial levies.

1604
01:17:13,145 --> 01:17:16,462
What the fuck happened?

1605
01:17:16,505 --> 01:17:18,742
Have you ever seen
a dam fail?

1606
01:17:18,777 --> 01:17:22,038
lt starts with a little crack,
a little seepage.

1607
01:17:22,073 --> 01:17:23,502
Reporter:
With overwhelming support,

1608
01:17:23,545 --> 01:17:25,399
Congress struck down
the restrictions.

1609
01:17:25,431 --> 01:17:27,287
Big banking
is barreling back.

1610
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,261
Black:
And it starts eroding

1611
01:17:29,305 --> 01:17:32,882
and it destroys all
the internal strength of the dam.

1612
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,512
Reporter:
Poison from the housing mess

1613
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:36,940
seeped deeper and deeper
into the banking system.

1614
01:17:36,984 --> 01:17:38,990
Black:
And soon the dam works against itself.

1615
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:40,940
The weight of the dam
and the weight of the water

1616
01:17:40,984 --> 01:17:42,292
conspire against it.

1617
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:43,984
Reporter:
lnvestors were dumping Bear shares

1618
01:17:44,023 --> 01:17:45,452
leading a huge selloff...

1619
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,469
Reporter #2:
The stocks of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

1620
01:17:47,511 --> 01:17:49,234
were in freefall
this morning...

1621
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:52,020
Black:
Then there's kind of a significant flow.

1622
01:17:52,054 --> 01:17:55,349
Reporter: Wall Street's losing
streak stretched into its seventh day.

1623
01:17:55,382 --> 01:17:59,244
Black: And then suddenly you've
got 60-70 foot sections.

1624
01:17:59,286 --> 01:18:00,398
A dam exploding.

1625
01:18:00,438 --> 01:18:02,095
Reporter:
Lehman Brothers, bankrupt.

1626
01:18:02,134 --> 01:18:03,856
Merrill Lynch,
sold in haste.

1627
01:18:03,894 --> 01:18:05,747
- Now AlG.
- Black: Just crashing.

1628
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:07,471
Reporter:
The market's year long slide

1629
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:10,029
has brought down
some of the biggest blue chips.

1630
01:18:10,069 --> 01:18:11,792
Black:
The water starts rushing through.

1631
01:18:11,828 --> 01:18:14,317
Reporter: This morning,
Washington Mutual has gone under,

1632
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,724
the largest failure
in US banking history.

1633
01:18:16,756 --> 01:18:18,479
Reporter #2:
Stocks fell off a cliff.

1634
01:18:18,516 --> 01:18:21,386
The largest single point drop in history.

1635
01:18:23,956 --> 01:18:27,271
Black:
lt destroys the rest of the dam.

1636
01:18:27,315 --> 01:18:29,039
And the whole failure

1637
01:18:29,076 --> 01:18:31,465
looks like it only takes
two minutes.

1638
01:18:31,507 --> 01:18:34,703
But of course,
it's that little hole

1639
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:37,521
that's been there
for several years

1640
01:18:37,555 --> 01:18:40,010
that really destroyed it.

1641
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:43,497
You have this fundamentally
unsound system

1642
01:18:43,537 --> 01:18:46,570
built on
a foundation of sand

1643
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:48,649
instead of bedrock.

1644
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:50,926
And it was rotted
from the core.

1645
01:18:52,402 --> 01:18:55,597
lt seems like capitalism
is just collapsing on itself.

1646
01:18:55,634 --> 01:18:57,292
Who got rich here?

1647
01:18:57,328 --> 01:18:59,564
Lots of people got rich
during this time,

1648
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:04,009
primarily the officers
and directors

1649
01:19:04,047 --> 01:19:06,536
of the large banks
and savings and loans

1650
01:19:06,576 --> 01:19:08,965
and the specialty
non-prime lenders.

1651
01:19:09,007 --> 01:19:12,302
These people became
unbelievably rich.

1652
01:19:12,336 --> 01:19:15,498
And members of Congress got rich,

1653
01:19:15,536 --> 01:19:17,259
especially once
they left Congress.

1654
01:19:17,296 --> 01:19:20,295
A number of them go and work
in the financial institutions.

1655
01:19:20,336 --> 01:19:22,823
Sure, and as do
Rubin and Summers.

1656
01:19:22,863 --> 01:19:26,310
Moore:
Robert Rubin, a one-time top executive

1657
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:29,286
at both Citigroup
and Goldman Sachs

1658
01:19:29,327 --> 01:19:31,050
champion a change in the law

1659
01:19:31,086 --> 01:19:33,421
that allowed commercial banks
to get into new areas

1660
01:19:33,453 --> 01:19:37,065
like investment banking
and exotic insurance products.

1661
01:19:38,797 --> 01:19:40,837
This made it legal
to let Citicorp

1662
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:42,569
merge with Travelers Group,

1663
01:19:42,605 --> 01:19:45,506
a deal valued
at $70 billion,

1664
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:47,786
creating the world's
largest bank.

1665
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,570
After leaving
the Clinton administration,

1666
01:19:50,604 --> 01:19:52,328
Rubin worked for Citigroup,

1667
01:19:52,364 --> 01:19:56,739
earning more than
$115 million.

1668
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:58,689
Summers made
his money where?

1669
01:19:58,731 --> 01:20:02,344
Summers made his money
as a supposed consultant

1670
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,250
and in giving speeches

1671
01:20:05,292 --> 01:20:07,528
at apparently, in some cases,

1672
01:20:07,564 --> 01:20:10,563
over $100,000 a pop.

1673
01:20:10,604 --> 01:20:14,115
Moore: Summers also made $5.2 million
at his part-time job,

1674
01:20:14,155 --> 01:20:17,253
advising a hedge fund.

1675
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,818
Where did Geithner work?

1676
01:20:18,859 --> 01:20:21,576
Geithner has been a failure

1677
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,782
at pretty much everything
he's done in life.

1678
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:28,225
Most of the institutions
that destroyed the economy

1679
01:20:28,266 --> 01:20:31,528
were under his direct
regulatory authority.

1680
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:33,765
How did he get the job
as Treasury Secretary?

1681
01:20:33,801 --> 01:20:36,671
By completely
screwing up his job

1682
01:20:36,712 --> 01:20:39,648
as President of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.

1683
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:41,346
That makes no sense.

1684
01:20:41,385 --> 01:20:42,945
Of course, it makes
perfect sense.

1685
01:20:42,984 --> 01:20:45,024
This is not
new to Washington.

1686
01:20:45,064 --> 01:20:47,431
People who will give you
the wrong answer

1687
01:20:47,465 --> 01:20:50,661
but the answer you want
are invaluable.

1688
01:20:50,697 --> 01:20:52,932
And they often get promoted

1689
01:20:52,969 --> 01:20:55,815
precisely because
they're willing to say

1690
01:20:55,847 --> 01:20:58,215
and do absurd things.

1691
01:20:58,247 --> 01:21:01,923
These are the people
that promised us

1692
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,756
that financial deregulation
would make all of us rich.

1693
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,127
And these are the people who
were personally made rich.

1694
01:21:12,135 --> 01:21:16,061
Moore: lt was not surprising that
the rich wanted to get richer.

1695
01:21:16,103 --> 01:21:19,713
But now they had come up with
a new and brazen way to do it.

1696
01:21:19,751 --> 01:21:23,492
Just back a big truck up
to the Department of Treasury

1697
01:21:23,525 --> 01:21:26,875
and take $700 billion
of our tax money,

1698
01:21:26,917 --> 01:21:28,827
no questions asked.

1699
01:21:28,868 --> 01:21:32,480
l got Michael Moore here. You know who
Michael Moore is, don't you?

1700
01:21:32,516 --> 01:21:35,266
The film director.
He's filming me right now.

1701
01:21:35,301 --> 01:21:36,795
- l got my wife on the line.
- Oh, hi.

1702
01:21:36,836 --> 01:21:38,527
How are you doing?
Baron Hill from lndiana.

1703
01:21:38,564 --> 01:21:39,970
How are you, sir?
Good state.

1704
01:21:40,005 --> 01:21:41,761
- We're from Michigan you know?
- Yeah.

1705
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:43,323
How did this
collapse happen?

1706
01:21:43,363 --> 01:21:47,422
l got home on a Friday, everything
was just fine in terms of the economy.

1707
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:50,078
l call back after my plane
landed in lndiana

1708
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:52,351
just to check in
with my office,

1709
01:21:52,387 --> 01:21:54,144
and all of a sudden we've
got this crisis on our hands

1710
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:56,154
and that l'm gonna have to vote
when l come back Monday

1711
01:21:56,194 --> 01:21:59,511
for a multibillion-dollar bailout
of the financial industry.

1712
01:21:59,555 --> 01:22:03,329
The word that we got
was that if we did not act immediately

1713
01:22:03,362 --> 01:22:07,966
the economy would collapse,
no doubt about it.

1714
01:22:08,002 --> 01:22:11,198
l felt that
the announcement

1715
01:22:11,234 --> 01:22:13,502
of this crisis in September,

1716
01:22:13,537 --> 01:22:15,326
just a few weeks
before election,

1717
01:22:15,362 --> 01:22:16,605
was very suspicious.

1718
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,542
This is when Congress
is the most nervous.

1719
01:22:19,585 --> 01:22:21,854
And l thought, ''Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

1720
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:24,224
This is not normal.''

1721
01:22:24,256 --> 01:22:26,046
Moore:
The leadership of Congress

1722
01:22:26,081 --> 01:22:27,608
and the Bush administration

1723
01:22:27,649 --> 01:22:29,885
quickly held a series
of private meetings

1724
01:22:29,921 --> 01:22:32,703
with the titans
of Wall Street to figure out

1725
01:22:32,735 --> 01:22:34,972
just how much money
was needed to cover

1726
01:22:35,007 --> 01:22:38,422
all the bad bets
investors had made.

1727
01:22:38,463 --> 01:22:42,359
A deal was cut with Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson,

1728
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:44,788
the former CEO
of Goldman Sachs,

1729
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:48,539
whose net worth was estimated
at $700 million

1730
01:22:48,574 --> 01:22:52,251
when he left Goldman
to go and run the Treasury Department.

1731
01:22:52,287 --> 01:22:55,930
l think we saw the best of
the United States of America

1732
01:22:55,966 --> 01:22:59,228
in the Speaker's
office tonight.

1733
01:22:59,261 --> 01:23:02,131
Moore:
The best of America?

1734
01:23:02,173 --> 01:23:05,916
Or did he mean
the best of Goldman Sachs?

1735
01:23:05,948 --> 01:23:07,640
The Treasury Department,

1736
01:23:07,676 --> 01:23:09,913
it's basically an arm
of Wall Street.

1737
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:12,884
All the people in charge
were from Goldman Sachs.

1738
01:23:12,925 --> 01:23:15,923
We call it Government Goldman
in the modern era.

1739
01:23:15,965 --> 01:23:18,037
Moore:
That's because there were now numerous

1740
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:21,688
former Goldman executives
inside the Bush Treasury Department,

1741
01:23:21,724 --> 01:23:23,895
as there were under Clinton.

1742
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:26,715
They worked as powerful
lobbyists from the inside

1743
01:23:26,747 --> 01:23:28,952
to abolish
financial regulations

1744
01:23:28,987 --> 01:23:31,354
while we paid
their salaries.

1745
01:23:31,387 --> 01:23:33,559
Black:
Treasury Secretary Paulson--

1746
01:23:33,595 --> 01:23:35,449
he wasn't just randomly
at Goldman.

1747
01:23:35,483 --> 01:23:38,832
He was the guy at Goldman
who got them big time

1748
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:42,421
into buying these exotic
housing derivatives.

1749
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:45,774
So he got Goldman in
a huge amount of trouble.

1750
01:23:45,818 --> 01:23:47,890
Moore:
lnsane housing derivatives

1751
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:50,800
had now destroyed much
of Goldman's competition.

1752
01:23:50,841 --> 01:23:53,264
And with the Goldman boys
now calling the shots

1753
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:56,023
inside the government,
they would ensure that Goldman

1754
01:23:56,057 --> 01:23:58,676
would end up as the kings
of Wall Street

1755
01:23:58,712 --> 01:24:00,087
when the dust settled.

1756
01:24:00,121 --> 01:24:01,779
Black:
So the last possible people

1757
01:24:01,818 --> 01:24:04,501
that should be giving advice
to Treasury would be Goldman.

1758
01:24:04,537 --> 01:24:05,998
So naturally Paulson,

1759
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:09,106
former CEO of Goldman,
puts them on.

1760
01:24:09,145 --> 01:24:11,729
And what advice do they
end up giving?

1761
01:24:11,769 --> 01:24:14,484
Well, to use the taxpayers

1762
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,854
to bail out Goldman

1763
01:24:16,887 --> 01:24:19,636
and other favored financial
institutions.

1764
01:24:19,671 --> 01:24:22,541
Well, Secretary Paulson
has submitted

1765
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:24,372
a simple proposal
to Congress.

1766
01:24:24,408 --> 01:24:26,512
This is it--
three pages.

1767
01:24:26,551 --> 01:24:29,202
lt's about
$1 billion a word.

1768
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:31,148
And it is quite simple.

1769
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:34,189
Secretary Paulson gets
the key to the treasury.

1770
01:24:34,230 --> 01:24:37,362
He's gonna start off
by borrowing $700 billion

1771
01:24:37,398 --> 01:24:38,827
in the name
of the American people,

1772
01:24:38,869 --> 01:24:41,967
maybe more later.
And it waives all laws.

1773
01:24:42,006 --> 01:24:44,144
All laws!

1774
01:24:44,181 --> 01:24:47,476
Not even court review.
Pretty simple proposal.

1775
01:24:47,509 --> 01:24:50,923
We are in a real
crisis situation

1776
01:24:50,965 --> 01:24:52,875
that could mushroom

1777
01:24:52,917 --> 01:24:55,185
into something worse
than the Great Depression.

1778
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:58,668
So l saw fear.
One gentleman started to cry.

1779
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:01,904
People are telling us
that it's going to be this gigantic calamity.

1780
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:03,729
And l'm up for election
in two months.

1781
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,454
Eight weeks away
from election,

1782
01:25:05,492 --> 01:25:08,011
l don't want to make a mistake.
What's the right thing to do?

1783
01:25:08,051 --> 01:25:10,125
Heaven help us.

1784
01:25:10,163 --> 01:25:12,073
lf we fail to pass this

1785
01:25:12,114 --> 01:25:14,765
l fear the worst
is yet to come.

1786
01:25:14,802 --> 01:25:16,975
And a few members
were even told

1787
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:20,457
that there would be martial law
in America if we voted no.

1788
01:25:20,498 --> 01:25:22,570
They were ramming this
thing down our throat.

1789
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:24,552
They wanted us to vote on it
right away

1790
01:25:24,594 --> 01:25:27,146
without any kind of
thoughtful analysis.

1791
01:25:27,186 --> 01:25:29,161
- No real hearings?
- No real hearings.

1792
01:25:29,202 --> 01:25:31,176
And l wasn't about to--

1793
01:25:31,217 --> 01:25:34,217
l got cornered into voting

1794
01:25:34,257 --> 01:25:36,810
for the lraq resolution
based upon some lies

1795
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:38,671
that they made to me and l wasn't going
to go through that again.

1796
01:25:38,706 --> 01:25:41,868
l will not wait on events
while danger is gathering.

1797
01:25:41,905 --> 01:25:45,253
l will not stand by as peril
draws closer and closer.

1798
01:25:45,296 --> 01:25:48,012
Use fear and then you
get done what you want.

1799
01:25:49,969 --> 01:25:52,456
And they created
in this window--

1800
01:25:52,496 --> 01:25:55,113
two months before election--
this pressure cooker.

1801
01:25:55,152 --> 01:25:57,737
People understand that
the House of Representatives

1802
01:25:57,775 --> 01:26:00,296
needs to pass this piece
of legislation.

1803
01:26:00,336 --> 01:26:03,150
Mr. Speaker, my message
to the American people...

1804
01:26:03,182 --> 01:26:06,051
don't let Congress
seal this Wall Street deal.

1805
01:26:06,095 --> 01:26:08,550
These criminals have
so much political power

1806
01:26:08,591 --> 01:26:10,925
they can shut down the normal
legislative process

1807
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:13,261
of the highest lawmaking
body in this land.

1808
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,149
All the committees
that should be scanning

1809
01:26:15,182 --> 01:26:18,181
every word of what is being
negotiated are benched.

1810
01:26:18,222 --> 01:26:20,841
And that means the American
people are benched too.

1811
01:26:20,877 --> 01:26:23,015
We are constitutionally sworn

1812
01:26:23,054 --> 01:26:25,094
to protect and defend
this republic

1813
01:26:25,134 --> 01:26:28,231
against all enemies
foreign and domestic.

1814
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:30,953
They say it's gonna be
Y2K all over again.

1815
01:26:30,988 --> 01:26:33,377
This is the same politics
of fear we are hearing

1816
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:35,810
from the fat-cat financial
bullies from Wall Street.

1817
01:26:35,853 --> 01:26:38,307
Why aren't we asking Wall Street
to clean up its own mess?

1818
01:26:38,347 --> 01:26:41,664
Why aren't we helping
American families faced with bankruptcy?

1819
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:44,676
Why aren't we reducing debts
from Main Street instead of Wall Street?

1820
01:26:44,716 --> 01:26:46,471
ls this the United States Congress

1821
01:26:46,507 --> 01:26:48,613
or the board of directors
of Goldman Sachs?

1822
01:26:48,652 --> 01:26:51,301
Moore:
The night before the vote

1823
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:54,088
the American people
in unprecedented numbers

1824
01:26:54,122 --> 01:26:57,024
flooded Capitol Hill
with millions of messages

1825
01:26:57,067 --> 01:26:59,653
demanding that
Congress vote no.

1826
01:27:02,987 --> 01:27:05,769
The bailout package
was defeated today,

1827
01:27:05,802 --> 01:27:07,940
voted down in the House
of Representatives.

1828
01:27:07,978 --> 01:27:09,604
The stock market plunged--

1829
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:12,194
plunged to the single
greatest point loss

1830
01:27:12,234 --> 01:27:14,438
in the Dow average
in one day ever.

1831
01:27:14,474 --> 01:27:16,000
The question is this:

1832
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:18,310
is the failure of
the bailout reason enough

1833
01:27:18,345 --> 01:27:21,412
to vote all the incumbents
out of office in five weeks?

1834
01:27:21,448 --> 01:27:23,238
1 2 votes killed it.

1835
01:27:23,273 --> 01:27:25,377
So did the voices of a lot
of the American people

1836
01:27:25,417 --> 01:27:28,613
who called their representatives
and said no.

1837
01:27:28,649 --> 01:27:30,917
Then Congress voted no.

1838
01:27:30,952 --> 01:27:32,840
Tonight Congress
has left town.

1839
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:35,622
Moore: lt was a rebuke that Congress
and Wall Street

1840
01:27:35,655 --> 01:27:38,338
had rarely,
if ever, experienced.

1841
01:27:38,376 --> 01:27:41,342
lt was what the Citibank
memo had warned against:

1842
01:27:41,384 --> 01:27:43,074
That if the peasants
ever chose

1843
01:27:43,112 --> 01:27:45,152
to exercise their
democratic rights,

1844
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:48,060
the pillaging by the wealthy
would be over.

1845
01:27:48,103 --> 01:27:52,064
So Paulson and company headed
back up to Capitol Hill.

1846
01:27:52,103 --> 01:27:55,266
And faster than you can say
''Check, please,''

1847
01:27:55,301 --> 01:27:58,913
they cut a backroom deal
with the help of the Democrats.

1848
01:28:00,582 --> 01:28:02,011
This issue supersedes
an election.

1849
01:28:02,055 --> 01:28:03,877
We need to get this right.
We need to do it quickly.

1850
01:28:03,909 --> 01:28:05,283
l agree with the secretary.

1851
01:28:05,318 --> 01:28:07,652
lt's not gonna openly cost
all these hundreds of billions.

1852
01:28:07,685 --> 01:28:09,573
We will recover most of it,
maybe all of it.

1853
01:28:09,604 --> 01:28:12,572
Kaptur:
The Democrats became

1854
01:28:12,613 --> 01:28:15,996
the delivery man
for a bill

1855
01:28:16,037 --> 01:28:18,273
for the Republican
president.

1856
01:28:18,309 --> 01:28:21,658
The presidents and presidents-
to-be made phone calls

1857
01:28:21,701 --> 01:28:24,699
and members-- l know
at least two members

1858
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:27,042
who have an interest
in the US Senate,

1859
01:28:27,076 --> 01:28:28,220
and promises were made.

1860
01:28:29,572 --> 01:28:31,676
Moore:
Within days, the Congress

1861
01:28:31,716 --> 01:28:33,626
did an amazing about-face

1862
01:28:33,667 --> 01:28:37,561
and gave the banks the 700-plus
billion they wanted,

1863
01:28:37,603 --> 01:28:39,391
the people be damned.

1864
01:28:39,426 --> 01:28:42,242
On this vote
the yeas are 263,

1865
01:28:42,274 --> 01:28:45,439
the nays are 17 1.
The motion is adopted.

1866
01:28:45,475 --> 01:28:49,631
lt was very carefully planned
to happen when it did,

1867
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:53,528
to involve the players
that it did.

1868
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:57,399
The message was carefully handled.

1869
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,382
They had Congress right where
they wanted them.

1870
01:28:59,426 --> 01:29:02,425
You don't think it
was just happenstance?

1871
01:29:02,465 --> 01:29:04,220
No.

1872
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:07,671
This was almost like
an intelligence operation

1873
01:29:07,712 --> 01:29:10,942
that had to be coordinated
at the highest levels.

1874
01:29:10,975 --> 01:29:13,430
This whole fiasco
shows you

1875
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:17,979
that there are
some forces--

1876
01:29:18,015 --> 01:29:20,503
That are not democratic.

1877
01:29:20,543 --> 01:29:22,332
Right.
That are in control.

1878
01:29:22,368 --> 01:29:25,018
Big time.

1879
01:29:25,055 --> 01:29:27,989
They did a masterful job.
Very well executed.

1880
01:29:30,591 --> 01:29:31,769
Do you think it's too harsh

1881
01:29:31,806 --> 01:29:35,068
to call what has happened
here a coup d'etat?

1882
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:36,596
A financial coup d'etat?

1883
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:39,637
No, because l think
that's what's happened.

1884
01:29:39,677 --> 01:29:42,809
- A financial coup d'etat?
- Yeah.

1885
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:46,037
l could agree with that.

1886
01:29:47,326 --> 01:29:49,332
l could agree with that
because the people here

1887
01:29:49,372 --> 01:29:51,228
really aren't in charge.

1888
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,649
Wall Street is in charge.

1889
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:57,298
Where's our money?

1890
01:29:57,341 --> 01:29:59,643
l don't know.

1891
01:29:59,676 --> 01:30:01,912
Reporter:
Citigroup is spending $50 million

1892
01:30:01,948 --> 01:30:03,509
on a luxury corporate jet.

1893
01:30:03,548 --> 01:30:06,003
You don't know?
But you're the person--

1894
01:30:06,043 --> 01:30:08,912
you're in charge of--
they put you in charge to find out.

1895
01:30:08,956 --> 01:30:10,582
Reporter:
Goldman Sachs has set aside

1896
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:12,889
6.8 billion for bonuses.

1897
01:30:12,922 --> 01:30:16,119
But Treasury followed
a don't-ask-don't-tell policy.

1898
01:30:16,154 --> 01:30:18,293
They didn't ask the banks

1899
01:30:18,331 --> 01:30:20,470
what they were going to do
with the money.

1900
01:30:20,506 --> 01:30:23,953
And not having asked them,
the banks are not required to tell.

1901
01:30:23,994 --> 01:30:26,546
AlG poolside meetings
at a Valley resort...

1902
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:27,731
Doesn't make any sense.

1903
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:30,355
We're getting word
that 73 people

1904
01:30:30,394 --> 01:30:33,207
received at least
$1 million apiece.

1905
01:30:33,242 --> 01:30:35,282
Why would the Department
of Treasury

1906
01:30:35,322 --> 01:30:37,394
not require the banks
to tell them

1907
01:30:37,434 --> 01:30:38,960
what they're doing
with our money?

1908
01:30:39,002 --> 01:30:42,546
You're going to have
to ask Secretary Paulson that question.

1909
01:30:42,585 --> 01:30:45,301
Because l've asked
that question

1910
01:30:45,337 --> 01:30:48,435
in my role as head of the Congressional
Oversight Panel,

1911
01:30:48,472 --> 01:30:50,479
and so far l haven't gotten an answer.
Maybe you'll get a better one.

1912
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,626
( phone ringing )

1913
01:30:52,664 --> 01:30:54,551
Woman: Good afternoon.
Hank Paulson's office.

1914
01:30:54,585 --> 01:30:56,046
Yeah, this is Michael Moore.

1915
01:30:56,087 --> 01:30:57,746
l'd like to talk
to Mr. Paulson.

1916
01:30:57,783 --> 01:30:59,757
- l'm sorry. Your name again?
- Michael Moore.

1917
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,293
- Michael Moore?
- Yup.

1918
01:31:01,336 --> 01:31:04,402
- ( hangs up )
- Hello? Hello?

1919
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:07,122
This is crazy what they're doing
with our money.

1920
01:31:07,159 --> 01:31:09,810
lf l could get them
to actually give the money back--

1921
01:31:09,847 --> 01:31:11,511
l'd be in favor of that.

1922
01:31:28,662 --> 01:31:30,996
We're here to get the money
back for the American people.

1923
01:31:31,029 --> 01:31:32,784
l understand, sir,
but you can't come in.

1924
01:31:32,822 --> 01:31:34,195
- Can you just take the bag?
- No.

1925
01:31:34,229 --> 01:31:35,722
- Take it up there?
- Absolutely not.

1926
01:31:35,765 --> 01:31:37,619
Fill it up.
l got more bags.

1927
01:31:37,653 --> 01:31:39,376
10 billion probably
won't fit in here.

1928
01:31:39,412 --> 01:31:40,524
You can't help me
get the money?

1929
01:31:40,564 --> 01:31:41,677
l can't help you
get the money.

1930
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:43,822
What would happen if l made
a run for it right now?

1931
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:48,331
Moore:
So l went to another bank.

1932
01:31:49,492 --> 01:31:50,506
We want our money back.

1933
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:52,042
l went to all the banks.

1934
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:54,255
- You've seen this guy?
- Yeah.

1935
01:31:54,292 --> 01:31:56,528
Okay, we're here to make
a citizen's arrest, actually.

1936
01:31:56,564 --> 01:31:58,864
Just drop it
from the windows.

1937
01:31:58,899 --> 01:32:01,354
And everywhere l went...

1938
01:32:03,027 --> 01:32:04,270
l got the same reaction.

1939
01:32:04,306 --> 01:32:06,380
We're actually here
to make a citizen's arrest

1940
01:32:06,418 --> 01:32:07,847
of the entire board
of directors

1941
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:08,970
and the executives here.

1942
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:10,319
Why don't you speak
to my supervisor?

1943
01:32:10,354 --> 01:32:12,109
- That's him right here.
- Where's he at?

1944
01:32:12,145 --> 01:32:13,868
- ln the white shirt? Blue tie?
- Yup.

1945
01:32:13,905 --> 01:32:15,215
- That's him.
- Receding hairline?

1946
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:18,664
They're using the money
to buy other companies.

1947
01:32:18,706 --> 01:32:21,259
This is our money.

1948
01:32:21,296 --> 01:32:23,238
Oh, this is
a police officer.

1949
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,320
l wanted to make a citizen's
arrest of the CEO.

1950
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,466
- Mr. Blankfein.
- ( chuckles )

1951
01:32:27,505 --> 01:32:30,154
But you're here, so maybe
you could help me.

1952
01:32:30,193 --> 01:32:33,509
- Let's do it outside.
- $170 billion of our taxpayer money.

1953
01:32:33,552 --> 01:32:36,650
- You're not allowed in the building, sir.
- But l'm here to make an arrest.

1954
01:32:36,689 --> 01:32:38,989
- l'm here to make an arrest.
- Make it outside, sir.

1955
01:32:39,024 --> 01:32:40,398
l can't make it outside.
They're upstairs.

1956
01:32:40,431 --> 01:32:42,253
l'll make an arrest, sir.

1957
01:32:42,287 --> 01:32:43,881
You can arrest somebody?

1958
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,643
lf you can arrest somebody,
l can arrest somebody.

1959
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,020
Sir, leave the building, sir.

1960
01:32:47,055 --> 01:32:48,364
Who else do you want
to leave the building?

1961
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:50,122
Your cameraman and your crew.
Come on out, sir.

1962
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:52,908
They don't speak English.
Donde?

1963
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:57,032
These guys have broken
so many laws, you know?

1964
01:32:57,069 --> 01:33:00,518
This is money.
lt's theft, it's fraud.

1965
01:33:09,645 --> 01:33:11,947
l'm gonna take it back
to the US Treasury

1966
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,704
right in this car.

1967
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:16,261
lt's safe.
You can trust me.

1968
01:33:17,773 --> 01:33:19,404
( grunts )

1969
01:33:19,564 --> 01:33:22,728
There's just these little hints

1970
01:33:22,765 --> 01:33:27,020
that the unimaginable

1971
01:33:27,051 --> 01:33:31,492
could occur, which is that...

1972
01:33:33,836 --> 01:33:36,802
people in general

1973
01:33:36,842 --> 01:33:39,363
in the United States
could actually

1974
01:33:39,403 --> 01:33:42,663
become angry

1975
01:33:42,698 --> 01:33:44,520
at the wealthy.

1976
01:33:44,555 --> 01:33:47,903
Shame on you!
Shame on you!

1977
01:33:47,945 --> 01:33:50,019
Shawn:
People who became rich in this country

1978
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:53,985
in the last decades
were not even making

1979
01:33:54,025 --> 01:33:57,703
the things
that everybody loved.

1980
01:33:57,737 --> 01:34:00,998
They were playing games

1981
01:34:01,033 --> 01:34:03,335
that ended up actually
harming everybody.

1982
01:34:03,368 --> 01:34:06,947
( chanting )

1983
01:34:06,984 --> 01:34:11,293
So some kind of disease
has entered into the economy.

1984
01:34:12,841 --> 01:34:16,354
Moore: lt was unusual for Americans
to turn against the rich

1985
01:34:16,391 --> 01:34:19,490
because of the carrot that had
always been held out in front of us,

1986
01:34:19,528 --> 01:34:22,594
that we too could be
one of them someday.

1987
01:34:22,631 --> 01:34:25,283
People were starting not to believe that.

1988
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:27,904
And that frightened the rich.

1989
01:34:27,944 --> 01:34:31,872
Because off in the distance
they heard something coming

1990
01:34:31,911 --> 01:34:34,463
and it wasn't another dry martini.

1991
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:37,154
lt was the friggin' people.

1992
01:34:38,981 --> 01:34:41,251
We are ready to take this country

1993
01:34:41,287 --> 01:34:43,359
in a fundamentally new direction.

1994
01:34:43,398 --> 01:34:45,886
That's what's happening
in America right now.

1995
01:34:45,926 --> 01:34:49,439
Change is what's happening
in America.

1996
01:34:49,476 --> 01:34:51,069
Moore:
Holy shit.

1997
01:34:51,109 --> 01:34:53,979
This was not
what Wall Street wanted.

1998
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:56,409
What if he won?

1999
01:34:56,453 --> 01:34:59,170
What would happen
to their way of life?

2000
01:35:00,932 --> 01:35:03,266
So they did what they always do.

2001
01:35:03,301 --> 01:35:05,372
They threw as much money
at him as they could.

2002
01:35:07,011 --> 01:35:10,306
Goldman Sachs became his
number-one private contributor

2003
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:13,055
with nearly $1 million in contributions.

2004
01:35:14,819 --> 01:35:18,266
But yet they still weren't sure
what he would do.

2005
01:35:18,307 --> 01:35:21,090
How did he really feel about them

2006
01:35:21,122 --> 01:35:23,490
and their way of life?

2007
01:35:23,490 --> 01:35:27,233
My attitude is that if the economy
is good for folks from the bottom up,

2008
01:35:27,265 --> 01:35:28,378
it's gonna be good for everybody.

2009
01:35:31,362 --> 01:35:33,368
Senator Obama is running
to spread the wealth.

2010
01:35:33,409 --> 01:35:35,744
Joe the Plumber said to him

2011
01:35:35,778 --> 01:35:38,265
that plan sounded like socialism.

2012
01:35:38,305 --> 01:35:40,606
( Russian music playing )

2013
01:35:41,729 --> 01:35:43,190
Joe:
l love America.

2014
01:35:43,233 --> 01:35:46,877
l want to make sure it stays a democracy
and not a socialist society.

2015
01:35:50,081 --> 01:35:53,341
l really think he's gonna bring socialism
if he gets half a chance.

2016
01:35:53,377 --> 01:35:55,994
l don't trust Obama at all.

2017
01:35:57,536 --> 01:35:59,422
l left Europe four decades ago

2018
01:35:59,456 --> 01:36:01,627
because socialism has killed
opportunities there.

2019
01:36:01,663 --> 01:36:05,210
''Someone is going to have to
give up a piece of their pie

2020
01:36:05,247 --> 01:36:07,386
so someone else can have more.''

2021
01:36:07,423 --> 01:36:08,699
l want all my pie.

2022
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,893
Barack Obama is a socialist,
it's that simple.

2023
01:36:16,573 --> 01:36:19,291
Moore:
The scare campaign wasn't working.

2024
01:36:19,327 --> 01:36:22,806
ln fact, the more they called
Obama a socialist,

2025
01:36:22,845 --> 01:36:25,779
the more he went ahead in the polls.

2026
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:28,407
And by using the word so much,

2027
01:36:28,444 --> 01:36:32,536
it made a new generation curious
about what that was.

2028
01:36:32,573 --> 01:36:35,094
For instance, few of them knew

2029
01:36:35,132 --> 01:36:37,719
there was actually a socialist
in the United States Senate.

2030
01:36:37,756 --> 01:36:40,854
Of course he was from
the gay state of Vermont.

2031
01:36:40,893 --> 01:36:42,202
( moos )

2032
01:36:42,237 --> 01:36:43,863
You say that you're a socialist.
Tell me what that means.

2033
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,689
l'm a democratic socialist,

2034
01:36:45,724 --> 01:36:48,341
which means that the function
of government is to represent

2035
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:49,755
middle income and working people

2036
01:36:49,787 --> 01:36:52,056
rather than just the wealthy
and the powerful.

2037
01:36:52,091 --> 01:36:53,880
One of the things that we've done here,

2038
01:36:53,914 --> 01:36:56,599
we've become very religious
in worshipping greed.

2039
01:36:56,636 --> 01:36:58,872
We put on the front pages
of the magazines

2040
01:36:58,908 --> 01:37:00,435
guys who have made
billions of dollars.

2041
01:37:00,475 --> 01:37:02,996
We ignore the cops, the firemen,
the teachers, the nurses

2042
01:37:03,034 --> 01:37:06,100
who every day are doing so much
in improving the lives of people.

2043
01:37:06,137 --> 01:37:07,479
We've got to change our value system.

2044
01:37:07,515 --> 01:37:10,164
Moore:
Hmm, that doesn't sound too bad.

2045
01:37:10,203 --> 01:37:14,096
l mean, it sounds like something
maybe we should try.

2046
01:37:14,137 --> 01:37:15,764
Within a few months,

2047
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:17,775
the Rasmussen poll reported

2048
01:37:17,818 --> 01:37:20,305
that only 37% of young adults

2049
01:37:20,345 --> 01:37:23,029
now favor capitalism over socialism.

2050
01:37:23,064 --> 01:37:26,261
l hope the economy will...

2051
01:37:26,296 --> 01:37:28,435
( people cheering )

2052
01:37:28,472 --> 01:37:31,255
At 11 :00 we project Barack Obama

2053
01:37:31,288 --> 01:37:33,809
President-Elect
of the United States of America.

2054
01:37:33,849 --> 01:37:36,336
( cheering )

2055
01:38:06,134 --> 01:38:08,467
Moore:
Just two years earlier

2056
01:38:08,502 --> 01:38:10,606
had anyone predicted
this moment,

2057
01:38:10,645 --> 01:38:13,100
they would have been
considered crazy.

2058
01:38:14,326 --> 01:38:16,332
But that's how fast
things change.

2059
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:21,289
lt was in an instant

2060
01:38:21,332 --> 01:38:24,813
a farewell to the old America.

2061
01:38:27,699 --> 01:38:31,180
The country
was electrified by his victory.

2062
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:33,935
And suddenly people
were inspired

2063
01:38:33,971 --> 01:38:36,722
to do things they never
would have done before.

2064
01:38:37,587 --> 01:38:39,244
Like the sheriff in Detroit

2065
01:38:39,283 --> 01:38:41,966
who decided it was time
to break the law

2066
01:38:42,002 --> 01:38:44,010
in order to help the people.

2067
01:38:44,051 --> 01:38:45,993
Warren Evans:
Doesn't it seem kind of strange to you

2068
01:38:46,034 --> 01:38:49,166
they would seek a government bailout?
l thought that's not what they do.

2069
01:38:49,202 --> 01:38:52,168
1-0-1 radio.

2070
01:38:52,211 --> 01:38:55,625
l thought the free market
is you sink or swim.

2071
01:38:55,667 --> 01:38:58,927
l just saw them sink
and cry like babies

2072
01:38:58,962 --> 01:39:01,417
for assistance from everybody else.

2073
01:39:02,545 --> 01:39:06,506
Today l will be stopping
all mortgage foreclosure sales

2074
01:39:06,545 --> 01:39:08,137
in Wayne County.

2075
01:39:08,176 --> 01:39:11,657
l cannot in clear conscience
allow anymore families

2076
01:39:11,697 --> 01:39:14,118
to lose their homes
through foreclosure sales.

2077
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:16,810
Moore:
What must the banks have thought

2078
01:39:16,847 --> 01:39:19,783
seeing the law that was set up
to protect their interests

2079
01:39:19,823 --> 01:39:21,481
being subverted?

2080
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,390
Do you think the free market
has failed Detroit?

2081
01:39:24,431 --> 01:39:27,529
Well, l mean, l think that the free market
failed the country.

2082
01:39:27,568 --> 01:39:29,743
You know, this is crazy.

2083
01:39:29,743 --> 01:39:31,631
Neighborhoods that are
completely destroyed

2084
01:39:31,662 --> 01:39:33,899
because too many homes
have been foreclosed.

2085
01:39:33,935 --> 01:39:36,868
And then you wonder,
is this really America

2086
01:39:36,911 --> 01:39:38,885
or is this a third-world country?

2087
01:39:38,926 --> 01:39:40,354
Exactly what are we doing here?

2088
01:39:40,398 --> 01:39:44,359
Until things get so bad that people
can do nothing but protest,

2089
01:39:44,398 --> 01:39:46,286
and then those
are called revolutions.

2090
01:39:46,318 --> 01:39:50,146
Moore:
And sometimes revolutions begin

2091
01:39:50,189 --> 01:39:51,367
in unlikely places.

2092
01:39:51,404 --> 01:39:53,194
Wake up.

2093
01:39:53,229 --> 01:39:54,822
Moore:
Living in the back of a truck

2094
01:39:54,862 --> 01:39:58,886
after a bank foreclosed on
the home they had owned for 22 years,

2095
01:39:58,925 --> 01:40:02,185
the Trody family of Miami,
with the help of their neighbors,

2096
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:04,555
took matters into their own hands.

2097
01:40:04,587 --> 01:40:07,457
On behalf of this family
and this community,

2098
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:10,796
we liberate this home for this family.

2099
01:40:10,828 --> 01:40:12,649
Cut the sign down.
Take it off.

2100
01:40:12,684 --> 01:40:14,854
- ( applause )
- Yay!

2101
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:17,509
When l say community,
y'all say power.

2102
01:40:17,547 --> 01:40:18,792
- Community!
- Power!

2103
01:40:18,827 --> 01:40:19,841
- Community!
- Power!

2104
01:40:19,884 --> 01:40:21,127
- Community!
- Power!

2105
01:40:21,162 --> 01:40:22,625
- Community!
- Power!

2106
01:40:22,667 --> 01:40:24,390
- Community!
- Power!

2107
01:40:24,426 --> 01:40:26,695
Moore: lt wasn't long
before the guy from the bank

2108
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:28,836
who had evicted them came back.

2109
01:40:28,875 --> 01:40:30,533
See this?

2110
01:40:30,570 --> 01:40:32,162
l want you to go ahead
and take a picture of that.

2111
01:40:32,203 --> 01:40:34,503
You're trespassing.

2112
01:40:34,538 --> 01:40:36,960
We did an eviction here and the people
went back inside the property.

2113
01:40:37,002 --> 01:40:39,555
Yes.
So l need police assistance.

2114
01:40:39,592 --> 01:40:41,087
When all these houses are empty

2115
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:43,430
the value of everybody
else's house goes down.

2116
01:40:43,466 --> 01:40:46,432
So if you can keep
these people in this house

2117
01:40:46,472 --> 01:40:48,612
that will help not only them...

2118
01:40:48,649 --> 01:40:51,496
So you see, the situation is that
the people--

2119
01:40:51,529 --> 01:40:53,438
if the bank lets them go back inside,

2120
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:56,829
then the bank misses the opportunity
to sell the house to somebody else.

2121
01:40:56,872 --> 01:40:59,391
The banks are selling
so many houses right now.

2122
01:40:59,432 --> 01:41:02,780
Well, if the bank lets everybody
get back inside the house for free--

2123
01:41:02,823 --> 01:41:04,679
Then people will have places to live.

2124
01:41:04,712 --> 01:41:07,329
Moore: People fighting back
was an unusual sight.

2125
01:41:07,368 --> 01:41:10,270
So nine police cars
responded to the call.

2126
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:12,220
Considering the neighborhood,

2127
01:41:12,262 --> 01:41:14,402
the response time
was impressive.

2128
01:41:14,439 --> 01:41:16,261
- You are not in charge.
- l'm not saying l'm in charge.

2129
01:41:16,295 --> 01:41:18,684
l'm saying she doesn't want to be isolated.
You don't have to answer any questions.

2130
01:41:18,726 --> 01:41:20,832
You don't have to say
anything to them, okay?

2131
01:41:20,869 --> 01:41:22,692
Moore:
But the Trodys stood their ground.

2132
01:41:22,726 --> 01:41:25,213
We don't have nowhere else to go.

2133
01:41:25,255 --> 01:41:28,037
- This was the backup plan.
- We're forced to live inside of a truck.

2134
01:41:28,069 --> 01:41:30,917
This was our plan B.
We don't have no plan C.

2135
01:41:30,949 --> 01:41:33,317
That is our grandma and it's not right.

2136
01:41:33,349 --> 01:41:35,738
She's been in this house for 22 years
and y'all gonna put her out?

2137
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:37,689
How do you feel putting people
out of their homes

2138
01:41:37,734 --> 01:41:39,773
every single frickin' day?

2139
01:41:39,814 --> 01:41:42,114
You should rather be home
instead of do something like that.

2140
01:41:42,149 --> 01:41:45,345
Where is the money the federal
government put in the bank?

2141
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:49,176
We should be telling you that you're
trespassing because this is our house.

2142
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:51,640
( crowd yelling )

2143
01:41:55,268 --> 01:41:58,431
Rooted like a tree,
rooted like a tree

2144
01:41:58,466 --> 01:42:00,855
We are here

2145
01:42:00,899 --> 01:42:03,746
Stand up strong...

2146
01:42:03,779 --> 01:42:06,234
Let's go.

2147
01:42:06,274 --> 01:42:08,216
- We did good. We did good.
- All right.

2148
01:42:08,257 --> 01:42:11,421
Moore: The police and the man
from the bank were sent packing.

2149
01:42:11,457 --> 01:42:13,563
Ain't no power
like the power of the people.

2150
01:42:13,603 --> 01:42:15,774
And the power of the people don't stop.
Say what?

2151
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:18,329
Ain't no power
like the power of the people.

2152
01:42:18,369 --> 01:42:20,824
And the power of the people don't stop.
Say what?

2153
01:42:20,865 --> 01:42:23,418
Don't leave your home.

2154
01:42:23,457 --> 01:42:24,766
Because you know what?

2155
01:42:24,801 --> 01:42:26,972
When those companies say
they have your mortgage,

2156
01:42:27,009 --> 01:42:29,823
unless you have a lawyer
that can put his finger

2157
01:42:29,856 --> 01:42:32,246
or her finger on that mortgage,
you don't have that mortgage.

2158
01:42:32,288 --> 01:42:36,086
And you're gonna find that they can't find
the paper up there on Wall Street.

2159
01:42:36,128 --> 01:42:39,957
So l say to the American people,
you be squatters in your own homes.

2160
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,421
Don't you leave
in Ohio and Michigan,

2161
01:42:42,463 --> 01:42:44,536
in lndiana and lllinois
and all these other places

2162
01:42:44,576 --> 01:42:46,582
where our people are being
treated like chattel.

2163
01:42:46,623 --> 01:42:49,657
And this Congress is stymied.

2164
01:42:49,694 --> 01:42:50,939
Moore: Wow.

2165
01:42:50,975 --> 01:42:53,658
lt's not every day you get
to see a member of Congress

2166
01:42:53,694 --> 01:42:56,319
encouraging open rebellion.

2167
01:42:56,319 --> 01:42:58,457
Back in Chicago,

2168
01:42:58,494 --> 01:43:00,764
the workers at Republic
Windows & Doors

2169
01:43:00,798 --> 01:43:02,009
had a bright idea.

2170
01:43:03,582 --> 01:43:05,818
They decided
that on second thought,

2171
01:43:05,854 --> 01:43:08,920
it wasn't okay to be fired
without notice,

2172
01:43:08,957 --> 01:43:11,925
to be denied their vacation
and severance pay

2173
01:43:11,966 --> 01:43:14,868
and to have their
medical benefits cut off.

2174
01:43:16,893 --> 01:43:19,479
So they came up with a plan.

2175
01:43:19,516 --> 01:43:22,332
Tell Bank of America
and the owners of the company

2176
01:43:22,364 --> 01:43:24,753
that it was a new day in America.

2177
01:43:24,796 --> 01:43:26,652
They weren't going
to leave the building

2178
01:43:26,684 --> 01:43:29,847
until they were paid
what they were owed.

2179
01:43:29,884 --> 01:43:33,680
Yes, it was a good old fashioned
sit-down strike.

2180
01:43:36,347 --> 01:43:38,551
Man:
We understand that perhaps

2181
01:43:38,587 --> 01:43:41,719
some bad business deals
were made.

2182
01:43:41,756 --> 01:43:44,854
But guess what?
We don't make business deals.

2183
01:43:44,890 --> 01:43:47,061
We make windows and doors.

2184
01:43:47,099 --> 01:43:48,953
Why should we be punished?

2185
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:03,221
Moore: The union organizers
and the workers

2186
01:44:03,256 --> 01:44:06,802
prepared for a police assault
that was sure to come.

2187
01:44:06,841 --> 01:44:09,360
l'm gonna take the chance.

2188
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,224
You're prepared to be arrested?

2189
01:44:11,256 --> 01:44:13,395
l am prepared to be arrested
if it's necessary.

2190
01:44:13,432 --> 01:44:17,229
We've been here since yesterday
and we aren't going anywhere.

2191
01:44:17,273 --> 01:44:19,029
We are committed to this.

2192
01:44:19,064 --> 01:44:21,300
Moore:
lt wasn't long before the media showed up.

2193
01:44:21,336 --> 01:44:24,118
And given the mood of the country
toward the bailout,

2194
01:44:24,152 --> 01:44:27,948
even the TV anchors had run out
of sympathy for the banks.

2195
01:44:27,992 --> 01:44:31,569
ln Chicago, a group of factory workers
watched like the rest of us

2196
01:44:31,606 --> 01:44:34,127
as taxpayers bailed out
the financial industry.

2197
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:37,297
Now these laid-off workers
are demanding Bank of America

2198
01:44:37,335 --> 01:44:39,921
spend some of its
bailout money on them.

2199
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:41,966
lt says ''Bank Robbers of America.''

2200
01:44:42,006 --> 01:44:45,038
Look, if we the taxpayers
are going to provide

2201
01:44:45,078 --> 01:44:47,948
a bailout for companies
like Bank of America,

2202
01:44:47,989 --> 01:44:50,739
then the least they can do
is use those funds

2203
01:44:50,774 --> 01:44:53,162
on American workers
and companies.

2204
01:44:53,206 --> 01:44:56,206
Woman:
$25 billion to Bank of America.

2205
01:44:56,244 --> 01:44:58,514
How do people sleep at night
when they act like that?

2206
01:44:58,548 --> 01:45:00,076
l don't get it.

2207
01:45:00,117 --> 01:45:01,939
Because what's the point
of bailing them out

2208
01:45:01,972 --> 01:45:04,525
if there aren't any jobs?

2209
01:45:04,564 --> 01:45:06,985
Moore:
The strike went on day after day.

2210
01:45:07,029 --> 01:45:09,679
The police had not yet come.

2211
01:45:09,716 --> 01:45:12,399
But the son of a Chicago
steelworker did.

2212
01:45:12,435 --> 01:45:16,429
He just also happened to be
the bishop in Chicago.

2213
01:45:16,467 --> 01:45:18,377
Ladies and gentlemen,

2214
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:20,524
l am Bishop James Wilkowski.

2215
01:45:20,563 --> 01:45:23,628
l know that you are all undergoing

2216
01:45:23,667 --> 01:45:25,609
a great trial.

2217
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:28,269
You are teaching

2218
01:45:28,306 --> 01:45:30,576
to our young people

2219
01:45:30,609 --> 01:45:32,551
that it is just

2220
01:45:32,595 --> 01:45:36,009
to challenge
that which is unfair.

2221
01:45:37,011 --> 01:45:40,939
l grew up on the far southeast
side of Chicago

2222
01:45:40,978 --> 01:45:42,636
and l saw what happened

2223
01:45:42,673 --> 01:45:45,869
when all the steel mills
disappeared.

2224
01:45:45,905 --> 01:45:48,654
And l saw the impact that it had

2225
01:45:48,689 --> 01:45:50,380
on families.

2226
01:45:50,417 --> 01:45:52,238
But this time

2227
01:45:52,273 --> 01:45:54,247
we are with you.

2228
01:45:54,288 --> 01:45:57,104
And we will not abandon you.

2229
01:45:57,136 --> 01:45:59,046
ln the name of the Father
and the Son

2230
01:45:59,088 --> 01:46:00,649
and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.

2231
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:02,576
The body of Christ.

2232
01:46:04,783 --> 01:46:06,344
The body of Christ.

2233
01:46:08,783 --> 01:46:10,244
The body of Christ.

2234
01:46:12,494 --> 01:46:15,177
President Obama:
When it comes to the situation

2235
01:46:15,215 --> 01:46:18,475
here in Chicago
with the workers

2236
01:46:18,511 --> 01:46:22,220
who are asking for the benefits
and payments

2237
01:46:22,255 --> 01:46:24,840
that they have earned,
l think they're absolutely right.

2238
01:46:24,877 --> 01:46:28,261
( cheering )

2239
01:46:28,301 --> 01:46:31,432
What's happening to them
is reflective of what's happening

2240
01:46:31,470 --> 01:46:33,356
across this economy.

2241
01:46:33,390 --> 01:46:35,909
Reporter: He said, ''What's happening to
them is reflective of what's happening...''

2242
01:46:35,949 --> 01:46:37,804
Reporter #2: He said what is
happening to those workers

2243
01:46:37,837 --> 01:46:40,324
is reflective to what's happening
across this economy.

2244
01:46:40,365 --> 01:46:43,114
l was watching Obama's press
conference this morning.

2245
01:46:43,149 --> 01:46:45,353
l just got out of bed and decided

2246
01:46:45,389 --> 01:46:48,006
the best thing l could do
was to feed people.

2247
01:46:48,045 --> 01:46:49,474
So l brought some food.

2248
01:46:49,515 --> 01:46:51,720
- l brought some sandwiches.
- Oh, good.

2249
01:46:51,756 --> 01:46:55,399
Moore: ln fact, lots of Chicagoans
showed up to support the workers.

2250
01:46:55,435 --> 01:46:56,930
Reporter: The workers have become
a national symbol

2251
01:46:56,971 --> 01:46:58,913
for thousands of employees
laid off across the country.

2252
01:46:58,956 --> 01:47:01,095
Reporter #2: The sit-in has grabbed
the attention of politicians

2253
01:47:01,131 --> 01:47:04,612
who believe it exemplifies an imbalance
between a Wall Street

2254
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:08,295
that gets government help
and a Main Street that gets the shaft.

2255
01:47:08,331 --> 01:47:10,239
Moore:
The question started to be asked:

2256
01:47:10,282 --> 01:47:12,649
Was this is the beginnings of a worker's
revolt against Wall Street?

2257
01:47:15,145 --> 01:47:17,185
The people united.

2258
01:47:17,225 --> 01:47:19,201
We'll never be defeated.

2259
01:47:19,242 --> 01:47:22,918
Bail out workers, not the banks.
Bail out workers, not the banks.

2260
01:47:22,953 --> 01:47:27,109
Moore: Pledges of financial support
and food showed up by the truckload.

2261
01:47:27,145 --> 01:47:30,375
Woman: lt's really beyond
what we had at first initially imagined.

2262
01:47:30,408 --> 01:47:33,091
And so now we're dreaming a little bit.

2263
01:47:33,128 --> 01:47:35,997
We even had a conversation--
well, what if we just tried

2264
01:47:36,041 --> 01:47:37,698
to run the factory like a cooperative?

2265
01:47:37,737 --> 01:47:39,677
We don't have any money.
We're not capitalists.

2266
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,688
We're having those kind
of conversations

2267
01:47:42,728 --> 01:47:45,345
and the workers are thinking about it
and it's a difficult thing

2268
01:47:45,384 --> 01:47:47,555
'cause, you know, if you've been
told your whole life

2269
01:47:47,591 --> 01:47:50,755
that things are the way
other people tell you they are,

2270
01:47:50,792 --> 01:47:52,701
to be able to think
l can make it different

2271
01:47:52,743 --> 01:47:55,710
is quite a big deal.

2272
01:47:57,831 --> 01:48:00,382
We're all over the national news.
Everyone is watching you

2273
01:48:00,422 --> 01:48:03,618
because they're so inspired by you.
( speaks Spanish )

2274
01:48:06,181 --> 01:48:07,938
Moore:
After six days of the sit-in

2275
01:48:07,975 --> 01:48:11,073
Bank of America decided
enough was enough.

2276
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:13,213
Better to pay off
these workers now

2277
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:16,483
and hope their little
revolution goes away.

2278
01:48:16,516 --> 01:48:20,095
And so the bank and the company
agreed to all the worker's demands.

2279
01:48:20,132 --> 01:48:22,914
Yes we did!
Yes we did!

2280
01:48:22,948 --> 01:48:26,462
The average package for each worker

2281
01:48:26,501 --> 01:48:30,210
will be very close to $6,000.

2282
01:48:30,244 --> 01:48:33,342
But this is about more
than just money.

2283
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:36,697
lt's about what can be achieved

2284
01:48:36,739 --> 01:48:40,569
when workers organize
and stand up for justice.

2285
01:48:40,612 --> 01:48:42,587
Just to fight--
fight fight fight fight fight

2286
01:48:42,627 --> 01:48:44,896
just to get the most basic thing

2287
01:48:44,930 --> 01:48:46,622
that people should take for granted

2288
01:48:46,658 --> 01:48:50,302
and that's legally theirs.

2289
01:48:50,338 --> 01:48:54,179
We just fight so hard just for
the most basic things in life.

2290
01:48:56,386 --> 01:48:59,386
Moore: lt's a fight we knew
all too well in Flint, Michigan.

2291
01:48:59,426 --> 01:49:02,654
For it was here that my uncle
and his fellow workers

2292
01:49:02,689 --> 01:49:05,307
first brought down the mighty
corporate interests

2293
01:49:05,345 --> 01:49:06,939
that dominated their lives.

2294
01:49:09,088 --> 01:49:12,350
lt was the day before
New Year's Eve in 1936.

2295
01:49:12,385 --> 01:49:15,680
Hundreds of men and women
took over the GM factories in Flint

2296
01:49:15,712 --> 01:49:17,948
and occupied them for 44 days.

2297
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:22,972
They were the first union that beat
an industrial corporation.

2298
01:49:23,007 --> 01:49:25,212
And their actions eventually resulted

2299
01:49:25,247 --> 01:49:27,614
in the creation of a middle class.

2300
01:49:27,648 --> 01:49:30,648
But back in these days of the Flint
sit-down strike,

2301
01:49:30,686 --> 01:49:34,842
the police and the company thugs
were not going to just stand by.

2302
01:49:34,878 --> 01:49:38,326
After a bloody battle one evening,
the Governor of Michigan,

2303
01:49:38,367 --> 01:49:41,399
with the support of the President
of the United States

2304
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:45,082
Franklin Roosevelt,
sent in the National Guard.

2305
01:49:45,118 --> 01:49:48,979
But the guns of the soldiers
weren't used on the workers.

2306
01:49:49,021 --> 01:49:50,614
They were pointed at the police

2307
01:49:50,654 --> 01:49:52,541
and the hired goons,

2308
01:49:52,573 --> 01:49:55,956
warning them to leave
these workers alone.

2309
01:49:57,054 --> 01:49:59,770
For Mr. Roosevelt believed
that the men inside

2310
01:49:59,805 --> 01:50:03,797
had a right to a redress
of their grievances.

2311
01:50:05,085 --> 01:50:08,184
Seven years later,
President Roosevelt was too sick

2312
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:11,896
to go up to the Capitol and give his
annual State of the Union Address.

2313
01:50:11,931 --> 01:50:13,688
Ladies and gentlemen,

2314
01:50:13,725 --> 01:50:16,474
the President of the United States.

2315
01:50:16,507 --> 01:50:20,850
lt has been my custom to deliver
these annual messages in person.

2316
01:50:20,891 --> 01:50:23,793
Moore: So he gave it from
the White House over the radio.

2317
01:50:23,835 --> 01:50:26,769
When it was over he asked
the newsreel cameras

2318
01:50:26,811 --> 01:50:29,746
to step into his room because he
wanted the American people

2319
01:50:29,787 --> 01:50:33,266
to see one particular part
of his speech.

2320
01:50:33,306 --> 01:50:36,787
The President of the United States
then took the radical step

2321
01:50:36,826 --> 01:50:39,411
of proposing a second Bill of Rights

2322
01:50:39,449 --> 01:50:40,791
to the Constitution.

2323
01:50:40,826 --> 01:50:44,305
ln our day certain economic truths

2324
01:50:44,345 --> 01:50:47,411
have become accepted
as self-evident.

2325
01:50:47,449 --> 01:50:49,904
A second Bill of Rights

2326
01:50:49,945 --> 01:50:53,556
under which a new basis of security
and prosperity

2327
01:50:53,592 --> 01:50:55,764
can be established for all

2328
01:50:55,801 --> 01:50:59,345
regardless of station
or race or creed.

2329
01:50:59,385 --> 01:51:02,068
Among these are:

2330
01:51:02,104 --> 01:51:05,900
The right to a useful
and remunerative job;

2331
01:51:05,944 --> 01:51:09,260
The right to earn enough to provide
adequate food

2332
01:51:09,302 --> 01:51:10,796
and clothing and recreation;

2333
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:13,261
The right of every farmer

2334
01:51:13,302 --> 01:51:15,636
to raise and sell his products

2335
01:51:15,671 --> 01:51:18,671
at a return which will
give him and his family

2336
01:51:18,711 --> 01:51:20,979
a decent living;

2337
01:51:21,015 --> 01:51:24,789
The right of every businessman
large and small

2338
01:51:24,822 --> 01:51:28,051
to trade in an atmosphere of freedom,

2339
01:51:28,087 --> 01:51:31,631
freedom from unfair competition
and domination

2340
01:51:31,670 --> 01:51:34,670
by monopolies at home or abroad;

2341
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:38,025
The right of every family
to a decent home;

2342
01:51:38,069 --> 01:51:41,548
The right to adequate medical care

2343
01:51:41,588 --> 01:51:45,331
and the opportunity to achieve
and enjoy good health;

2344
01:51:45,364 --> 01:51:48,560
The right to adequate protection

2345
01:51:48,596 --> 01:51:51,858
from the economic fears
of old age,

2346
01:51:51,891 --> 01:51:54,280
sickness, accidents

2347
01:51:54,323 --> 01:51:56,079
and unemployment;

2348
01:51:56,115 --> 01:51:59,051
The right to a good education.

2349
01:51:59,091 --> 01:52:03,314
All of these rights spell security.

2350
01:52:03,347 --> 01:52:06,250
And after this war is won,

2351
01:52:06,291 --> 01:52:09,520
we must be prepared
to move forward

2352
01:52:09,555 --> 01:52:12,521
in the implementation
of these rights

2353
01:52:12,561 --> 01:52:16,173
to new goals of human happiness
and wellbeing.

2354
01:52:16,210 --> 01:52:20,520
For unless there is security
here at home,

2355
01:52:20,561 --> 01:52:25,198
there cannot be lasting peace
in the world.

2356
01:52:34,256 --> 01:52:37,421
Moore: Roosevelt would be dead
in little over a year.

2357
01:52:40,113 --> 01:52:43,309
He would not live to see
the end of the war.

2358
01:52:43,344 --> 01:52:47,020
Nor would there be any enactment
of his new Bill of Rights.

2359
01:52:54,190 --> 01:52:57,060
Had he lived and succeeded,

2360
01:52:57,103 --> 01:52:59,340
every American,
regardless of race,

2361
01:52:59,375 --> 01:53:02,375
would have had a right
to a decent job...

2362
01:53:05,198 --> 01:53:06,725
a livable wage...

2363
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:10,539
universal health care...

2364
01:53:12,493 --> 01:53:14,152
a good education...

2365
01:53:16,493 --> 01:53:18,565
an affordable home...

2366
01:53:20,621 --> 01:53:22,792
a paid vacation...

2367
01:53:26,444 --> 01:53:28,965
and an adequate pension.

2368
01:53:31,692 --> 01:53:34,180
None of this would come to pass.

2369
01:53:36,171 --> 01:53:40,328
No American would be
guaranteed any of this.

2370
01:53:43,787 --> 01:53:46,307
But the people of Europe and Japan

2371
01:53:46,346 --> 01:53:48,932
got every one of these rights.

2372
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:51,524
How did that happen?

2373
01:53:51,563 --> 01:53:56,101
After the war, the people
of Roosevelt's administration

2374
01:53:56,137 --> 01:53:58,984
went overseas
to help rebuild Europe.

2375
01:53:59,018 --> 01:54:02,846
During this time new constitutions
were written

2376
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:07,167
for the defeated nations
of Germany, ltaly and Japan.

2377
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:09,795
The ltalian constitution

2378
01:54:09,832 --> 01:54:12,680
guaranteed all women equal rights.

2379
01:54:12,712 --> 01:54:15,395
And this was 1947.

2380
01:54:15,432 --> 01:54:19,426
The German constitution
said that the state has the right

2381
01:54:19,465 --> 01:54:22,760
to take over property
and the means of production

2382
01:54:22,792 --> 01:54:24,614
for the common good.

2383
01:54:24,648 --> 01:54:27,582
And here's what we wrote up
for the Japanese.

2384
01:54:27,623 --> 01:54:30,885
All workers have a right
to organize into a union.

2385
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:34,596
And academic freedom
is guaranteed.

2386
01:54:34,631 --> 01:54:37,380
For the next 65 years

2387
01:54:37,414 --> 01:54:39,389
we would not become the country

2388
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:41,252
that Roosevelt wanted us to be.

2389
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:45,886
lnstead, we became this...

2390
01:54:53,158 --> 01:54:55,743
l remember thinking
during the Katrina flood,

2391
01:54:55,782 --> 01:54:57,636
''Why is it always the poor

2392
01:54:57,668 --> 01:54:59,425
who have to suffer the misery?

2393
01:54:59,462 --> 01:55:01,796
Why isn't it ever Bernie Madoff
up on the roof

2394
01:55:01,828 --> 01:55:03,454
screaming for help?

2395
01:55:03,493 --> 01:55:05,184
Or the head of Citibank

2396
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:08,569
or the hedge fund guys
at Goldman Sachs?

2397
01:55:08,613 --> 01:55:11,579
Or the CEO at AlG?''

2398
01:55:11,619 --> 01:55:13,759
lt never is these guys, is it?

2399
01:55:13,796 --> 01:55:17,373
lt's always those who
never got a slice of the pie

2400
01:55:17,412 --> 01:55:19,615
because these men
took it all

2401
01:55:19,652 --> 01:55:21,789
and left them with nothing,

2402
01:55:21,828 --> 01:55:23,518
left them to die.

2403
01:55:25,954 --> 01:55:28,637
l refuse to live in a country like this.

2404
01:55:28,675 --> 01:55:30,682
And l'm not leaving.

2405
01:55:44,033 --> 01:55:47,229
We live in the richest
country in the world.

2406
01:55:47,265 --> 01:55:50,712
We all deserve a decent job,

2407
01:55:50,753 --> 01:55:54,364
healthcare, a good education,

2408
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:57,498
a home to call our own.

2409
01:55:57,536 --> 01:55:59,957
We all deserve FDR's dream.

2410
01:56:01,536 --> 01:56:03,707
And it's a crime that we don't have it.

2411
01:56:04,927 --> 01:56:06,488
And we never will,

2412
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:09,844
as long as we have a system
that enriches the few

2413
01:56:09,887 --> 01:56:12,189
at the expense of the many.

2414
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:16,247
Capitalism is an evil.

2415
01:56:16,287 --> 01:56:18,261
And you cannot regulate evil.

2416
01:56:20,287 --> 01:56:23,930
You have to eliminate it
and replace it with something

2417
01:56:23,966 --> 01:56:26,868
that is good for all people.

2418
01:56:26,911 --> 01:56:30,707
And that something
is called democracy.

2419
01:56:43,132 --> 01:56:45,555
Crimes have been committed
in this building.

2420
01:56:45,596 --> 01:56:48,247
l am here to make a citizen's arrest.

2421
01:56:48,284 --> 01:56:51,634
Please come down
and step away from the building.

2422
01:56:51,676 --> 01:56:53,782
Do not be afraid.

2423
01:56:53,819 --> 01:56:56,635
Federal prison is a nice place.

2424
01:57:00,539 --> 01:57:03,386
You know,
l can't really do this anymore

2425
01:57:03,418 --> 01:57:06,288
unless those of you who
are watching this in the theater

2426
01:57:06,332 --> 01:57:08,305
want to join me.

2427
01:57:08,346 --> 01:57:10,288
l hope you will.

2428
01:57:10,331 --> 01:57:12,948
And please, speed it up.

2429
01:57:14,681 --> 01:57:18,457
Arise ye workers
from your slumber

2430
01:57:18,489 --> 01:57:21,752
Arise ye prisoners of want,
that's right

2431
01:57:21,786 --> 01:57:25,747
For reason in revolt
now thunders

2432
01:57:25,786 --> 01:57:28,568
Chains of hatred, greed
and fear

2433
01:57:28,601 --> 01:57:32,878
Away with all
your superstitions

2434
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:36,750
Servile masses arise, arise

2435
01:57:36,792 --> 01:57:40,404
We'll change henceforth
the old tradition

2436
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:43,789
And spurn the dust
to win the prize

2437
01:57:43,832 --> 01:57:47,509
So comrades, come on and rally

2438
01:57:47,543 --> 01:57:51,188
And the last fight let us face

2439
01:57:51,224 --> 01:57:54,539
The lnternationale

2440
01:57:54,583 --> 01:57:58,543
Unites the whole darn
human race

2441
01:57:58,582 --> 01:58:00,720
So comrades, come on

2442
01:58:00,759 --> 01:58:02,417
Let's go rally

2443
01:58:02,454 --> 01:58:06,033
And the last fight let us face

2444
01:58:06,069 --> 01:58:09,332
The lnternationale

2445
01:58:09,365 --> 01:58:13,457
Unites the whole darn human race

2446
01:58:13,493 --> 01:58:17,289
No more deluded by reaction

2447
01:58:17,332 --> 01:58:20,595
On tyrants only we'll make war

2448
01:58:20,628 --> 01:58:24,688
The soldiers too will take strike action

2449
01:58:24,725 --> 01:58:27,627
They'll break ranks and fight no more

2450
01:58:27,668 --> 01:58:31,662
And if those cannibals keep trying

2451
01:58:31,701 --> 01:58:35,148
To sacrifice us to their pride

2452
01:58:35,188 --> 01:58:39,115
Each at the forge must do their duty

2453
01:58:39,155 --> 01:58:42,569
And we'll strike while the iron is hot

2454
01:58:42,612 --> 01:58:46,472
So comrades, come on, let's go rally

2455
01:58:46,515 --> 01:58:50,159
And the last fight let us face

2456
01:58:50,194 --> 01:58:53,228
The lnternationale

2457
01:58:53,266 --> 01:58:57,422
Unites the whole beautiful
human race

2458
01:58:57,457 --> 01:59:01,101
So comrades, come on, let's go rally

2459
01:59:01,137 --> 01:59:05,000
And the last fight let us face

2460
01:59:05,042 --> 01:59:08,042
The lnternationale

2461
01:59:08,082 --> 01:59:13,645
Unites the whole darn
human race.

2462
01:59:28,752 --> 01:59:31,599
Jesus Christ was a man

2463
01:59:31,631 --> 01:59:34,087
That traveled through the land

2464
01:59:34,127 --> 01:59:39,113
A carpenter true and brave

2465
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:41,671
And he said to the rich

2466
01:59:41,711 --> 01:59:44,131
Give your goods to the poor

2467
01:59:44,173 --> 01:59:49,061
And they laid Jesus Christ
in the grave

2468
01:59:49,101 --> 01:59:51,752
He went to the sick

2469
01:59:51,789 --> 01:59:54,474
And he went to the poor

2470
01:59:54,510 --> 01:59:56,997
And he went to the hungry

2471
01:59:57,037 --> 01:59:59,493
And the lame

2472
01:59:59,533 --> 02:00:01,835
And he said that the meek

2473
02:00:01,868 --> 02:00:04,618
Would inherit the whole world

2474
02:00:04,653 --> 02:00:09,475
And they laid Jesus Christ in the grave

2475
02:00:10,604 --> 02:00:12,359
One day Jesus stopped

2476
02:00:12,396 --> 02:00:15,079
At a rich man's door

2477
02:00:15,115 --> 02:00:19,872
What must l do to be saved?

2478
02:00:20,844 --> 02:00:22,917
Take all you own

2479
02:00:22,956 --> 02:00:25,289
And give it to the poor

2480
02:00:25,323 --> 02:00:30,277
And they laid Jesus Christ in the grave

2481
02:00:30,314 --> 02:00:32,703
When the love of the poor

2482
02:00:32,747 --> 02:00:35,332
Shall one day turn to hate

2483
02:00:35,371 --> 02:00:37,890
When the patience of the workers

2484
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:40,296
Gives away

2485
02:00:40,329 --> 02:00:43,231
lt would better for the rich

2486
02:00:43,274 --> 02:00:45,695
lf they'd never been born

2487
02:00:45,738 --> 02:00:50,375
So they laid Jesus Christ in the grave

2488
02:00:56,041 --> 02:00:58,560
When Jesus came to town

2489
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:01,055
All the working folks around

2490
02:01:01,096 --> 02:01:06,114
Believed what he did say

2491
02:01:06,152 --> 02:01:09,054
But bankers and preachers

2492
02:01:09,095 --> 02:01:11,234
Nailed him to the cross

2493
02:01:11,271 --> 02:01:16,060
And they laid Jesus Christ in the grave

2494
02:01:16,104 --> 02:01:18,753
Well, the people held their breath

2495
02:01:18,792 --> 02:01:21,541
When they heard about his death

2496
02:01:21,574 --> 02:01:26,594
And everybody wondered why

2497
02:01:26,631 --> 02:01:29,663
lt was the landlord and soldiers

2498
02:01:29,703 --> 02:01:31,742
Lawmen they had hired

2499
02:01:31,783 --> 02:01:36,833
That nailed Jesus Christ in the sky

2500
02:01:36,869 --> 02:01:39,587
We would lay Jesus Christ

2501
02:01:39,621 --> 02:01:42,140
ln the grave, Lord, Lord

2502
02:01:42,181 --> 02:01:46,109
We would lay Jesus Christ
in the grave

2503
02:01:47,077 --> 02:01:49,564
lf Jesus preached today

2504
02:01:49,604 --> 02:01:52,256
Like he preached in Galilee

2505
02:01:52,292 --> 02:01:56,930
They would lay Jesus Christ
in his grave.
