1
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,892
Your 10-year high school reunion.

2
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,977
Everybody wants to make
a good impression.

3
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,396
And I was making mine on...

4
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,983
Ted? Tad? Whatever.

5
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,744
I know, not exactly
"Most Likely to Succeed",

6
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,288
but it's not like I had
a law degree to brag about,

7
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,834
or a Rittenhouse Square
apartment or a fancy job.

8
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,503
- Or a job, period.
- Man.

9
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,255
Is that it?

10
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,174
Yes, baby, that's... That's it.

11
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:08,020
There are women, thinner women,
who have lace bras, silk thongs.

12
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,857
Things designed to excite a man.

13
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,486
A thong would look ridiculous on me.

14
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,697
I wear cotton briefs.

15
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,868
My life is about working long hours,
planning trips I never take,

16
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,788
and settling for love found
on the pages of romance novels.

17
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,962
And because things like this
never happen to me,

18
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,007
the lawyer in me wants proof.

19
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,810
Hold on.

20
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,283
- Is this Rose Feller?
- Who is this?

21
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,328
My name's Todd. I'm here with your sister.

22
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,540
Things like this, on the other hand,
happen all the time.

23
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,011
Put them on the side, man.

24
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,661
Those are my shoes.

25
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:53,668
You know, it is actually possible to attend
a reunion and not wind up passed out

26
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,544
on the bathroom floor.

27
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:04,345
1994 called. It wants its hair scrunchie back.

28
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Oh.

29
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,809
How are the fashionable girls
wearing their hair these days

30
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:13,229
when they pick up their drunk sisters
in the middle of the night?

31
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,735
Is that even a dress?

32
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,071
Just drive.

33
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,747
Shit.

34
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,515
- You're drunk.
- Shh.

35
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,560
Don't let Sydelle know.

36
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,687
Oops.

37
00:05:56,106 --> 00:06:00,359
I was very clear. You can only stay here
if there was none of your nonsense.

38
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,863
- Excuse me, I'm gonna go to bed.
- And throw up all over my white carpets?

39
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,365
Absolutely not. Take your things and go.

40
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,659
- Where is she supposed to go?
- I don't care.

41
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,870
- Take her home with you.
- No way.

42
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,998
Gee, you two really know
how to make a girl feel special.

43
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,000
- I want to talk to Dad about this.
- Your father's asleep.

44
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,627
My Marcia and her husband
are coming for brunch tomorrow.

45
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:19,962
He needs his rest.

46
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,215
I'm sure if he were given the choice
of resting up for your child

47
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,593
or talking to his own, he'd choose me.

48
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,804
Did you just raise your eyebrow?

49
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,642
I can't tell. It doesn't...
It doesn't move anymore.

50
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,650
"My Marcia's coming for brunch."

51
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,944
To stuff her anorexic face.

52
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,329
What is this?

53
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,668
Rose Feller,

54
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,505
- is there a man in this house?
- Shh.

55
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,674
- A human man?
- Shh! Maggie.

56
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,343
Ohh.

57
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,222
- No, give me that.
- No.

58
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,349
Maggie, Maggie.

59
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,772
- Yummy, yummy.
- Shh.

60
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,607
He's cute. Who is he?

61
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,150
None of your business.

62
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,363
Well, I for one

63
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,408
am shocked

64
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,578
and appalled.

65
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,206
Shh! Don't, Maggie. Shut up.

66
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,879
Life doesn't have to be this hard, Mag.

67
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,717
If I just prepared a little, you know?
Maybe went back to school.

68
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,469
Right.

69
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,639
Because that worked so well the first time.

70
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,516
I mean, the literacy place.

71
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,563
- Retard U.
- If you just went back,

72
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,191
finished up there, maybe it'll help you
figure out what you're good at.

73
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,070
I know what I'm good at.

74
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,989
Besides that.

75
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,825
You have so much potential.

76
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,412
You do realize I'm drunk, don't you?

77
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,919
Remember Honey Bun?

78
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,137
How long did we have him for?

79
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,932
- A day.
- Mm.

80
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,021
That was a good day.

81
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,984
Yeah.

82
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,262
- Oh, good morning. Um...
- Hey.

83
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,557
- Is that English?
- Oh, Jim.

84
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,477
This is my sister, Maggie.

85
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,188
She just dropped by last night to visit.

86
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,065
Right.

87
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,115
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

88
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,539
I'm sorry about that.

89
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,584
It's not a problem. Hey.

90
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,677
I could've sworn I had some twenties here.

91
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,189
Mm-hm.

92
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,526
Okay.

93
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,475
Sherbet.

94
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,110
Where does she get the time to do this?

95
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,112
Okay.

96
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,947
I love you.

97
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,410
Mmm.

98
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,916
All right, Rose. What do you got?

99
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,510
Oh, shit.

100
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,971
There's a man in this picture?

101
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,433
Oh, shut up. I had technical difficulties.

102
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:30,064
Trust me, look, he's gorgeous
and smart and totally smoldering.

103
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,733
Can you make that a full pound
of the hot sopressata?

104
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,986
- You got it.
- Office romances can go very bad.

105
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,530
Or very good.
Thirty percent of married women

106
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,451
- met their husbands at work.
- Where did you get that statistic?

107
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,578
Made it up.

108
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,540
All extracurricular activity
happens off campus.

109
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,125
His place or yours.

110
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,962
Yeah, well, his.
Mine's a little crowded these days.

111
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,298
- Maggie.
- No.

112
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,966
Just till she finds a job.

113
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,428
You say that like that's something
she's remotely capable of.

114
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,305
Why do you let her do this to you?

115
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,723
Because.

116
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,558
She's my sister.

117
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,817
All right, what's your name?

118
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,528
Maggie May Feller.

119
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,154
What's yours?

120
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,825
Some of you with plans for the weekend
will unfortunately have to cancel.

121
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,912
The settlement talks for the Donaldson
case have broken down completely.

122
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,331
So we'll need to start gearing up for trial.

123
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,835
Simon, put together
a deposition schedule today

124
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,462
and, Ellen, draft
a summary-judgment motion.

125
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,256
I'll need to see that before we file it.

126
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,633
So you'll need to get it
to me by Thursday, okay?

127
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,260
Let's get to it.

128
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:45,347
Listen, I'm supposed to go to Chicago to do
some recruiting interviews next weekend.

129
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,434
But it's my kid's birthday.
Can you go for me?

130
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,768
- Chicago?
- Yeah.

131
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,813
- It's cold there.
- Oh, come on, I promised I'd be the clown.

132
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,441
I don't know. If I can drag an associate along

133
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,026
to help with the interviews
so I don't fall behind.

134
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,696
Feller?

135
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,698
Any interest? Chicago?

136
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:08,078
Oh, gee, I don't know.
I mean, like you said, it's pretty cold there.

137
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,289
Well, buy some mittens.

138
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,004
Rose? Your sister.

139
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,717
Guess who's in New York waiting for her
callback to be the next MTV vee-jay.

140
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,051
Uh...

141
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,972
Out of curiosity, how much
did it cost you to get up there?

142
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,516
Who cares? I'll make it back.

143
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,478
Oh, right, when MTV hires you
and makes you a great big star.

144
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,022
Would it kill you to be supportive?

145
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,901
I mean, would that just send you
into "anaphallic" shock or something?

146
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,737
Anaphylactic, Maggie, not anaphallic.

147
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,530
Maggie May Feller?

148
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,073
I have to go.

149
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:49,077
- That's me.
- You're next.

150
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,497
Welcome back,
Maggie May.

151
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,457
Thank you. It's good to be back.

152
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,001
Now, you see the screen
with the words on it?

153
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,675
Just read what it says
and just look into the camera

154
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,511
and give it that...

155
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,845
That...

156
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,015
Personality. Just let it shine through.

157
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,522
Okay, whenever you're ready.

158
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,402
It's Friday afternoon on... Oh.

159
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,701
- Okay. Let's try again.
- Okay.

160
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,328
Just relax.

161
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,877
It's Friday afternoon on TRL and...

162
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,839
Take it back.

163
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:49,012
It's Friday afternoon on TRL
and later today...

164
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,103
You okay, Maggie May?

165
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,065
Yeah.

166
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,829
Well? Are you famous yet?

167
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,424
A position in retail.
Employment history?

168
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,971
What was your last job?

169
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,808
- Lucky Jeans for three weeks.
- Why'd it end?

170
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,731
Some crazy bitch with a coupon.

171
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,067
The coupon says 15 percent.
Fifteen percent of the total.

172
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,029
Fifteen percent of 42.
Do the math. What's your problem?

173
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:51,491
Okay, well, if anyone asks,
just say it wasn't challenging enough.

174
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,454
And before that was the restaurant,
right, the Canal House?

175
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,303
And before that?

176
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,265
Before that, the Gap.

177
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,227
Before that? The Limited.

178
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,398
Wanamaker's Fragrance,
Wanamaker's Accessories.

179
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,026
Come on! You really don't wanna
do this right now, do you?

180
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,488
No. But I also don't want you
on my couch for the next three months.

181
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,119
I'll let you do my resume
if you let me do your makeup.

182
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,330
Forget it.

183
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,666
- Why?
- At some point today,

184
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,169
I have to face the world. I'd rather
not do it looking like a $20 hooker.

185
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,881
Oh, come on, I promise.
You'll still look like you, just better.

186
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,260
Let's go pick out an outfit for inspiration.

187
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,762
Shoes.

188
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,348
- I don't have...
- Shoes.

189
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,937
You know, you don't even wear
most of these.

190
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,317
Shoes like these should
not be locked in a closet.

191
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,904
They should be living a life
of scandal and passion

192
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,365
and getting screwed
in an alley by a billionaire

193
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,450
while his frigid wife waits in the limo,

194
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,161
thinking that he just went back into
the bar to get his cell phone.

195
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,747
- These are cute too.
- Please tell me you just made that up.

196
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,874
Look, if you're not gonna wear them,

197
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,752
don't buy them.

198
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,338
Leave them for someone
who'll get something out of them.

199
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,465
I get something out of them.

200
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,140
When I feel bad, I like to treat myself.

201
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,809
Clothes never look any good.

202
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,103
Food just makes me fatter.

203
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,939
Shoes always fit.

204
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,876
Don't slouch.

205
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,504
- Something for you ladies?
- I think we're gonna just take a minute.

206
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,799
- Thanks.
- I thought I was getting a drink out of this.

207
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,634
Patience.

208
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,485
Ew, Maggie, no.

209
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,209
How would you ladies
like to join us for something wet?

210
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,796
- What is that?
- It's a vagina.

211
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,715
You know what? Sydelle's right.
You're completely obscene.

212
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,218
Why? Because I say "vagina"?

213
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,305
"Michael, I don't
know what's wrong with your girls.

214
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,099
"My Marcia never uses the word 'vagina."'

215
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:06,394
"Oh, no, my Marcia
doesn't even have a vagina."

216
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,438
"Oh, my Marcia has a vagina, all right.

217
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,692
"But my Marcia's vagina
is made of solid 24-karat gold."

218
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:17,948
"My Marcia's vagina is so perfect,
it's in a museum."

219
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:23,995
What can I get you girls?

220
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,999
We'll have two stacks
of whole-wheat honey pancakes

221
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,751
and a side of bacon, please.

222
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,587
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

223
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,090
Oh, and are you hiring?

224
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,009
I'll bring an application.

225
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,638
"My Marcia never eats pancakes.

226
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,890
"That's why my Marcia still wears..."

227
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,934
What?

228
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,436
I can't believe you just did that.

229
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,273
Did what?

230
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,192
"Are you hiring?"

231
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,738
God, Rose, we were having fun for once.

232
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,449
- It's an opportunity.
- To do what?

233
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,328
To work the graveyard shift serving
pancakes to cops and whores and drunks?

234
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,707
I think you should work so you don't
have to mooch off me for everything.

235
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,126
What are you saying?
I just got us two rounds of drinks.

236
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,462
No, Cuervo Carl got the drinks and only
because he hoped you'd sleep with him.

237
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,424
Well, I didn't.

238
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,343
You need a job, Maggie.

239
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,557
There's a whole world of commerce
out there that has nothing to do with sex.

240
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,476
Where people actually make money
without seducing anyone.

241
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,478
Obviously, or you'd starve.

242
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,650
You're not gonna look like this forever,
you know?

243
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,153
Eventually you'll be older.

244
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,448
And then all the men who foot your bill now

245
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,492
will be buying drinks for girls half your age,
and what are you gonna do then?

246
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:49,873
Well, you better think of something,
because middle-aged tramps aren't cute.

247
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,500
They're pathetic.

248
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,880
Fine.

249
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,799
What are you doing? Sit down, Mag.

250
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,676
Mag?

251
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,599
Your car is here, Miss Feller.

252
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,398
Thank you.

253
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,619
Hey. Danvers got busy. He sent me instead.

254
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,623
Almond croissant? Still warm.

255
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,217
Hi.

256
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,719
I was wondering if you guys are hiring?

257
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,695
Hi.

258
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,075
Shit.

259
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,161
Great.

260
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,456
Shit.

261
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,607
You know about anal glands?

262
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,359
What?

263
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,445
- Squeeze.
- Ew...

264
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,238
Oh, you get used to it.

265
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,991
Grab yourself an apron. We got all sizes.

266
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,620
Sorry.

267
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,416
Hello, Sydelle.

268
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,961
No, I can't come right now.

269
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:03,465
Look, I'll get there when I get there, okay?
Thank you.

270
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,427
Stepmother.

271
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,473
You can put it all in the basement.
I need this space.

272
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,267
I'm converting it to a nursery
for my Marcia's baby.

273
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,977
She's pregnant?

274
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,647
- She will be very soon.
- Maggie.

275
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,900
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.

276
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,735
- Hi.
- I thought I heard your voice.

277
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,987
- What brings you here?
- I'm being evicted.

278
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,074
Are you gonna wear that, Michael?
If you're not, you should change.

279
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,408
We're already late.

280
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:36,498
Mustn't be late.
Stick around, Maggie, have dinner with us.

281
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,167
- Tempting.
- Yeah.

282
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,214
Oh, try not to burn the house down.

283
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,030
Don't look at me like that, my Marcia.

284
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,629
Shit.

285
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,092
Mike, how do you stop loving somebody

286
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,970
when they've stopped loving you?

287
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,727
We are within walking distance
to three of the best restaurants in the city.

288
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,062
I've already eaten.

289
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,317
Grease is not a food group, Feller, all right?

290
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,611
Bon appétit.

291
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,953
Okay, I'm not gonna start
with your butt first, okay?

292
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,956
I'll wait for us to get to know each other
a little better.

293
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,418
All right, here we go.

294
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,463
Come... Okay.

295
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,718
Oh!

296
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,345
Shit.

297
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,640
Here we go.

298
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,899
Oh, God.

299
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,910
Oh!

300
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,664
Truce.

301
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,640
Damn it.

302
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,225
Oh...

303
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,477
They got you too, huh?

304
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:48,815
- What?
- They tow on Saturdays.

305
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,858
Great.

306
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,610
Do you know where they take the cars?

307
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,822
Uh, yeah.
It's this impound lot down on South Street.

308
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,200
I'm parked on the corner. I'm taking him
and I'd be glad to take you too.

309
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,035
Yeah. If you want.

310
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,747
Yeah, that would be great.

311
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,125
You know, are we... Are we in a rush?

312
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,377
Because I could stand going for a drink.

313
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,631
- Sure.
- All right, cool.

314
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,300
- What's your name?
- Maggie.

315
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,135
- Hey, Grant, nice to meet you.
- I'm Tim.

316
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,721
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice way to end your day.

317
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,725
Yeah. My sister would kill me
if she knew I got her car towed.

318
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,900
What'd you say?

319
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,121
Where is this place?

320
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,165
We're almost there.

321
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,938
- We're in like Flynn.
- All right, go ahead.

322
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,156
- There it is.
- Right on, let's go.

323
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,117
- All right.
- All right, thanks.

324
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,328
- All right.
- So thanks for the ride.

325
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,456
Thanks for the drinks and the fun,
and we'll see you guys later.

326
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,959
Well, I mean wait, wait. Hang on, hang on.
Maybe we can go do something.

327
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,212
- It's early still.
- No, I'm just gonna go.

328
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,881
But you can't just take the car.
You gotta pay for it.

329
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,926
What are you doing? Hey, wait up. Wait.

330
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,886
Grant. Leave her alone.

331
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,721
Oh, God.

332
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,376
What the hell is that?

333
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,837
It's Honey Bun Two.

334
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,507
- You bought a dog?
- No, I borrowed him.

335
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,846
I didn't wanna be alone last night.
I had a bad night.

336
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,475
So did I, Maggie. Several of them.
But you don't see me stealing dogs.

337
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:33,354
I was scared. There were these guys and...

338
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,524
- Of course there were.
- Look, I got home and you were gone.

339
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,359
- I just I don't know.
- Plane was late.

340
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,069
Have to be in court in 20 minutes.

341
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:43,781
I missed two days of work for nothing,
which means I'll have to work forever.

342
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:47,827
Now I'm getting a cold. So I don't have room
in my head for your problems right now.

343
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:53,666
Just have my sheets cleaned
and the dog out by the time I get home.

344
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,806
My car has a boot on it!

345
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,392
How the hell did my car get a boot on it?

346
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,980
Oh, I was trying to tell you.
I... I used it the other... The other day...

347
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,316
Five years I've had that car, not one ticket.

348
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,569
You use it without permission for two days.

349
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,613
- Melanie, it's me.
- Hi, Rose.

350
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,573
There's an emergency. I can't get to court.

351
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,658
- Can you send someone to cover for me?
- You got it.

352
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,076
Thank you.

353
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,580
You ruin everything.

354
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,545
I can't take this anymore, Maggie. I can't.

355
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,255
I want you out.

356
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:45,259
Now. Today, before I get home from work.

357
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:48,888
- Where am I supposed to go?
- That is not my problem.

358
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,642
You are your problem. You figure it out.

359
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,066
Lewis, Dommel and Fenick.

360
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,443
How was Chicago?

361
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,571
- Cold.
- Sorry I couldn't swing it.

362
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,951
- Things were crazy around here.
- Yeah, I know. I work here too.

363
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:19,460
You know, Jim, if you say you're gonna be
in Chicago, you should be in Chicago.

364
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,589
And if you can't make it, if you know you're
gonna send Simon Stein in your place,

365
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:26,050
then pick up the goddamn phone.

366
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,126
Bitch.

367
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,159
It's okay, Honey Bun. Shh.

368
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,213
Is Rose here?

369
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,716
Nope.

370
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,181
Ohh.

371
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,948
Rose? Rose?

372
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,579
I liked you.

373
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,249
I really liked you.

374
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,920
She won't even remember your name.

375
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,381
In fact, she can't even spell it.

376
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,258
Can you, Mag?

377
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,385
Give it a try. Come on, sound it out.

378
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,553
Ji...

379
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,221
...im.

380
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,557
Jim.

381
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:23,352
Pretty, but real stupid.

382
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,771
Shut up, you fat pig!

383
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,986
Did you honestly just say "you fat pig"?

384
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,868
You are my sister

385
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,328
and the best you can do

386
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,039
is "fat pig"?

387
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:53,174
Get out of my life!

388
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,813
Is there anything I can do?

389
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,858
I want 200 bucks.

390
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,404
That's the going rate, isn't it?

391
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,045
When's your next train to New York?

392
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,549
18.

393
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,481
Mrs. Lefkowitz?

394
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,406
All right, already.

395
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,201
Sorry, I thought it was my son.

396
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,495
- I'll get my list.
- Okay.

397
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,040
I didn't know your son was here.

398
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,167
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah, well.

399
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,836
He said he wants to see me.

400
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,256
And where is he now?
He's on the beach looking at bosoms.

401
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,135
Hey. Lewis?
What's the matter?

402
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,054
- You look like you just had a stroke.
- Hi, Mrs. Lefkowitz.

403
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,390
- Oh, hi, Ella. Hi. I didn't see you.
- Hello.

404
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,017
She's invisible.

405
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,353
- You look confused.
- Well, who needs all these choices?

406
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,730
It's soap.

407
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,399
I say, when in doubt,

408
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,610
- go for the simplest box.
- Ah.

409
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,529
You know,
Sharla taught me almost everything.

410
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,657
Cooking, dishes, how to use a cell phone.

411
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,534
Never got around to the laundry.

412
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,661
You must miss her.

413
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,706
Mm. Every day. You?

414
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,835
Well, I didn't know your wife,
so, no, I can't say that I do.

415
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,634
Oh, finally a date with Lewis Feldman.

416
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,011
What do you mean?

417
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,347
He's had his eye on you since he got here.

418
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,224
That's ridiculous. He has not.

419
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,479
Anyway, it's not a date.
I'm just helping him with his laundry.

420
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:56,523
What do you think dates look like
around here, bungee jumping?

421
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,692
Believe me, it's a date.

422
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,905
At least she's gone.

423
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,491
Where did she go to, anyway?

424
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,369
I don't know.

425
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,746
My dad's, I guess.

426
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:15,042
Well, that's good. Give Sydelle
one more thing to complain about.

427
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,548
Which one are you crying about,

428
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,802
the predatory prick
or the shit-for-brains tramp?

429
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,888
Because neither one deserves your tears.

430
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,601
You know, Amy,

431
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,063
I'm sure you're right.

432
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,071
But sometimes I wish you'd just say,

433
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,365
"Boy, that sucks.

434
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,410
"And I'm really sorry it happened to you."

435
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,501
Do you have them for every high holiday?

436
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,170
Yeah. The Passover one says,

437
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,172
"What makes this tochis unlike any other?"

438
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,009
- Funny.
- My son, the joker.

439
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:09,430
Thinks it makes up for the fact that
they go to her parents on the holidays.

440
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,934
Well, at least he's married.
My son, 55, still single.

441
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,270
- Gay?
- I wish.

442
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:20,190
- Immature.
- Ella, tell me about your family.

443
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:25,988
Well, my husband, Ira, was in real estate.
Died three years ago, cancer.

444
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,407
That's funny?

445
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,952
No, it's the way we do
that dead-spouse intro.

446
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,872
Name, rank, when did he die, how.

447
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,373
But not the specifics.

448
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,043
Cancer's okay,
but no one ever says "lung cancer."

449
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,545
Or, God forbid, prostate cancer.

450
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,381
How about you? Have any kids?

451
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,468
No.

452
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,803
No, I don't have any children.

453
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,690
Rufus?

454
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,150
Is that Rufus?

455
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,987
Is Shirley back from Europe already?

456
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,824
Ooh, I thought she... I thought she was
boarding Rufus for another month.

457
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,326
She is, yeah.

458
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:13,619
I just

459
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,120
walk

460
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,747
Rufus.

461
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,166
- Oh, you're with The Elegant Paw.
- No.

462
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,627
- No, I'm...
- Hi, Carol.

463
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,879
I'm freelance.

464
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,507
A freelance dog-walker.

465
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,260
- I see.
- Yeah, I work for kennels, with kennels...

466
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,806
And with... For individuals too.

467
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,974
- It's just what we need.
- Absolutely.

468
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,434
How much do you charge?

469
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,314
Jesus, you saved my ass.

470
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,565
Where did you find him?

471
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,527
Oh, just wandering around Rittenhouse.

472
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,781
You know, I give this girl a job.
She seems normal.

473
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,534
Next thing I know,
she's taken off with this dog.

474
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,412
You can imagine, something like this
gets out and I'm out of business.

475
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,999
So how does 200 sound for a reward?

476
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,626
Fair enough?

477
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,170
I don't want a reward.

478
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,464
- What are you, a saint?
- No.

479
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,884
I was thinking, maybe, instead of a reward,

480
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:15,389
you could offer your clients my
dog-walking services. Exclusively.

481
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,767
We could split the proceeds.

482
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,051
Not so much as the Winnebago he left her.

483
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,637
Oh, it's horrible.

484
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,765
You won't be laughing when
you're eating government cheese.

485
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,435
Hello.

486
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,731
- Hello?
- Is this Ella Hirsch?

487
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,359
- Yes, it is.
- Did you have a daughter named Caroline?

488
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,864
Yes.

489
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,758
So are you on vacation or...

490
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,722
Yeah.

491
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,474
Hmm.

492
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,143
Well, we've been having wonderful weather.

493
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,526
I'm so glad you called.

494
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,740
I'm so glad you're here.

495
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,770
Mrs. Lefkowitz,
this is my granddaughter Maggie Feller.

496
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,816
- Hello.
- Hi.

497
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,654
Well, you must be starving.
I can fix you something to eat.

498
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,614
No, that's... I'm fine.

499
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,116
I just...

500
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,702
I'm really tired.

501
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,204
Oh! Well, let me show you the guestroom.

502
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,293
It's right through here. This is the bathroom.

503
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,796
And I'll put out clean towels
and a washcloth.

504
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,423
The bed's made up.

505
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:58,135
And there are extra blankets in the closet.

506
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:01,471
Is my grandfather around?

507
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,390
Oh. No.

508
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,935
No, Ira passed away over three years ago.

509
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,231
So you'll call me if you need anything?

510
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,233
Yeah.

511
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,586
Hey, you said you didn't have children.

512
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,964
I said, "I don't have children."

513
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:38,342
I had a daughter.

514
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,887
Her name was Caroline. She died.

515
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,431
What was she like?

516
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,310
Well, she was...

517
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,896
She was exactly like that.

518
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,439
Same eyes.

519
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,734
Same skin, same face. Identical.

520
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:00,113
But she had health problems.

521
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,283
She had mental-health problems.

522
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,078
Well, how did she die?

523
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,293
Car accident.

524
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,839
A leave of absence? Why?

525
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,175
I'm just not happy at that firm.

526
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,427
So, instead, you'll be walking dogs.

527
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,721
And running errands.

528
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,015
I think it'll be fun.

529
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,810
Are you okay?

530
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,646
You're not having...

531
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,315
What?

532
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:39,403
If you ever wanna talk to someone, Rose...

533
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,906
I'll pay for it, no questions asked.

534
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,117
If you're ever feeling...

535
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,743
Crazy?

536
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,955
I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

537
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,833
How is Maggie?

538
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,629
- You haven't seen her?
- No, she's still with you, isn't she?

539
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,089
Oh, yeah, she is.

540
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,007
She's fine.

541
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,512
- Thanks for the coffee.
- See you soon?

542
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,238
The number
you have called is no longer in service.

543
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:24,990
If you feel you have reached this...

544
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,047
Well, good morning.

545
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,508
Did you sleep well?

546
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,343
Fine, thanks.

547
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,264
I have English muffins here.
I can make you any kind of eggs you'd like.

548
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,932
I don't eat breakfast.

549
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,392
Oh.

550
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:53,852
I drink coffee.

551
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:57,355
So...

552
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,484
My goodness, this is a surprise.

553
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,986
Such a lovely surprise.

554
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,988
After all this time.

555
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,575
Yeah, what's up with that?

556
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,744
I beg your pardon?

557
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,706
Well, were you always out of the picture,
or just after Mom died?

558
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,168
Oh, your grandfather and I
were never out of the...

559
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,046
I mean, we were always there. We...

560
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,217
And even after your mom died, I wrote

561
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,429
birthday cards every year.
And I never heard back.

562
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:32,307
Yeah, I know. You wrote for a while.
I just found them.

563
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,768
What do you mean, "just"?

564
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:36,937
I guess they got waylaid.

565
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,897
Thanks for the money.

566
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,400
You're telling me that your father
never gave you my cards?

567
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,111
Mm-mm.

568
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,614
What must you have thought?

569
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,117
I thought you both were dead.

570
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,750
Does this place have a pool?

571
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,627
- Oh, sorry.
- Whoa.

572
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,255
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

573
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,632
Whoa. Come on, hurry.

574
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,971
Hey, check this out.

575
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,764
- Fellas.
- Incoming.

576
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:15,058
Hey, guys.

577
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,733
Where did she come from?

578
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,336
Hi, sweetheart.

579
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,852
Come on, come on. Come on.

580
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,911
I don't believe it.

581
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,796
Rose. Rose Feller.

582
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,216
- Oh, Stein.
- How are you?

583
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,136
Man, you look great.

584
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,598
- Not sick at all.
- Why would I look sick?

585
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,099
Oh.

586
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,894
That's one of the rumors.

587
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,771
There are rumors?

588
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,985
How about that? Lunchtime.

589
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:52,489
- Hey, how does Japanese sound?
- I'm not hungry, Stein.

590
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:55,158
Oh, there's no such thing
as not hungry for sushi.

591
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,662
Come on.
We'll bill it to one of your old clients.

592
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,914
Thank you. You eat everything?

593
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,166
- What do you think?
- Okay.

594
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,918
Two orders of uni.

595
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,753
One masago.

596
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,380
- Two tako.
- Okay.

597
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,798
Two hamachi.

598
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:13,635
And then, also, that cod thing
that was a special once,

599
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,762
but it's not on the menu anymore?
You know?

600
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,430
- Tara.
- Yes.

601
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,933
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

602
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,768
Thanks.

603
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,354
- You just ordered for me.
- Yes.

604
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,856
- What am I, 12?
- I'm an expert orderer.

605
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,858
- It's a gift.
- Is it?

606
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:33,363
Absolutely. What was the last
great restaurant you went to?

607
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:38,410
- I took my sister to Le Bec-Fin.
- Uh-huh.

608
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,995
And you both got the

609
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,249
snapper, right?

610
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,042
Close. I got the snapper.

611
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,545
She got three rum and Cokes
and the sommelier's phone number.

612
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,297
Okay. Well, I'll take you there

613
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,258
and we'll get

614
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:57,345
the foie gras with Roquefort stuffed fig,

615
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:02,809
Scottish wood pigeon with cabbage
and porcini cassoulet.

616
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:07,147
And the chocolate mousse

617
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,983
with raspberries and hazelnut macaroon.

618
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:13,194
You'll wanna eat with me
for the rest of your life.

619
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,325
Here you go.

620
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,910
Mmm.

621
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,830
- The special, tara.
- Thank you.

622
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,206
Enjoy.

623
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,001
So

624
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,378
what are the other rumors?

625
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,130
Ah. Um...

626
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,424
Rumor one, mysterious illness.

627
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,762
Rumor two,
headhunted by Pepper & Hamilton.

628
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,767
Here, try some of this.

629
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,226
Rumor three?

630
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:48,521
- Um, soy?
- Oh, come on. What's rumor three?

631
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,362
Affair with a partner gone bad.

632
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,538
Don't worry.

633
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,916
Most people are betting on lupus.

634
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:18,259
Here, wasabi makes everything better.

635
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,433
So, uh, what time Friday?

636
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,393
- Friday?
- Dinner.

637
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:32,106
Oh, look, Simon, this was...
This was really nice, but I don't think that...

638
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:33,733
Seven it is.

639
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:38,863
Thank you.

640
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:48,957
- That smells good. What is that?
- That's braised veal.

641
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,171
Shit.

642
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,883
There's a paper towel on the counter.

643
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,266
Out of curiosity,

644
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,602
how long is this vacation
of yours going to last?

645
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,356
How come you don't have
any pictures of my mom around?

646
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,441
Don't you like thinking about her?

647
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,737
I don't need to have a picture
to think about my daughter.

648
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,707
You put out pictures, people ask questions.

649
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,586
They expect you to tell them
everything and I don't do that.

650
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,629
Because Mom was sick?

651
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,465
Because she's gone.

652
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,636
Is that why you pulled away from us?

653
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,889
So that you didn't have to talk
about her with us either?

654
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,640
I didn't pull away.

655
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:49,767
I was pushed.

656
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,857
No, listen, I'm not the one
who didn't pass along the letters.

657
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:59,444
That was your father. I'm not the one
who didn't want a relationship.

658
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:02,822
He said that? "I don't want you to have
a relationship with my daughters."

659
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:05,033
- Oh, yes.
- When?

660
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:08,119
- At the funeral.
- Why? Why would he say that?

661
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,414
Because he's irrational.

662
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:16,920
Yeah. He blamed me for everything.
Every bad day, every bad episode.

663
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,505
He did not want me near her.

664
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:25,303
And after she was gone,
he didn't want me near you or your sister.

665
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,227
I just wonder.

666
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,940
If you had tried harder, you know.

667
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,442
Or, like, tried again

668
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,945
after he'd gotten over the whole

669
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,031
shock and grief of it.

670
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,699
You know?

671
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,205
Because it would've been nice
having a grandmother.

672
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,625
Nice and...

673
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:59,462
Maybe a little less lonely.

674
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,720
She sounds like a manipulative
little nincompoop.

675
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,474
- The girl lost her mother.
- So? You lost your daughter.

676
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:14,018
- It's not the same.
- It's worse.

677
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:17,063
A parent burying a child
goes against the law of nature.

678
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,984
Well, so does a grandparent
abandoning her grandchildren.

679
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,736
You said yourself
he didn't want you around.

680
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:26,781
What were you supposed to do,
break down the door?

681
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,199
Yes.

682
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,577
Shoelace.

683
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,789
For Caroline?

684
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:36,749
Yes.

685
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,251
Caroline.

686
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,504
She was gone, cookie.
You pushing your way

687
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,090
into that house wasn't
gonna do a thing for her.

688
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,342
- She wanted me there.
- You don't know that.

689
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,428
Yes, I do. I know.

690
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,430
How?

691
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,057
I just do.

692
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,601
How?

693
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:01,190
I've never told anybody this. Not even Ira.

694
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,109
I'll take it to my grave.

695
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,777
Probably tomorrow.

696
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,868
It wasn't a car accident.

697
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,453
I mean...

698
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,247
It was a car, and...

699
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,250
There was a crash.

700
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,377
But...

701
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,213
How do you know it was on purpose?

702
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,801
She wrote a note.

703
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,474
It came the day after the funeral.

704
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,477
What'd it say?

705
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,562
One line.

706
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:43,608
"Please take care of my girls."

707
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:45,818
And you didn't.

708
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,363
You didn't, because you couldn't.

709
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,824
Now you can, so you will.

710
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:56,412
Ella, bubeleh, you did the best you could
in a very bad situation.

711
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:59,123
You got nothing to feel guilty about.

712
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,503
And you tell that to Miss Hotsy-Totsy Pants.

713
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,517
So this is where all my boyfriends
have been coming from.

714
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,437
They took a vote.
I don't know who I pissed off,

715
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,940
but somehow I lost.

716
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,483
Or won.

717
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,401
Either way, it's official.

718
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:30,279
I am the captain of the softball team.

719
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,033
Yeah.

720
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:40,123
Look, I know this isn't my business,
but I can't not say anything.

721
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:44,710
You have rights, legal options
for getting your job back.

722
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,255
I don't want it back.

723
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:48,881
You don't?

724
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:54,595
I thought you loved it. You were always
the first one there in the morning

725
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,557
- and the last one to leave at night.
- I know.

726
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,350
Not because I loved it.

727
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,977
Then why?

728
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,147
I don't know.

729
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,690
Maybe...

730
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,985
I was scared of what would happen
if I wasn't there.

731
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:11,821
What, like the place would
fall apart without you?

732
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,824
With law freaks like you there? Never.

733
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,411
No, I wasn't worried about the office.

734
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:22,665
I guess it was more me.

735
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,833
I mean, what would happen to me

736
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,461
without those people to please
and those tasks to get done?

737
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:32,341
Like, maybe those were the things
holding me together.

738
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,553
And without them I'd

739
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,681
fall apart.

740
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,518
But you didn't.

741
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,354
I guess not.

742
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:50,026
So, what does hold you together?

743
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:02,163
For me, it's the law, politics,

744
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,957
the Sixers and good food.

745
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:09,795
If you ever wanna join me
for a game or a meal,

746
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,174
I hope you'll give me a call.

747
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,650
Ella?

748
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,772
Oh, I was just looking for...

749
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,274
For what?

750
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:19,031
- Sorry, I'm...
- Wrong dresser.

751
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,536
- It's in the sock drawer.
- What is?

752
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,581
My cash. That's what you were looking
for, right? That's what you want?

753
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,043
No, God.

754
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,088
Oh, well.

755
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:37,675
I guess after being absent
for some 20-odd years or so,

756
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,553
I can't expect you to wanna
have a relationship with me.

757
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:41,804
How much?

758
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,681
- How much what?
- Money, Maggie.

759
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:47,059
How much money were you
hoping to get from me?

760
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,565
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

761
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,694
I wanna go to New York.

762
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,323
Maybe act.

763
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,242
I think I'd be good at it.

764
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,910
Clearly.

765
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,247
- How much do you need?
- Three grand.

766
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,125
That you would not have
found in the sock drawer.

767
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:12,960
How much do you have?

768
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:17,840
Well.

769
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:21,927
I won't give you $3000. But I'll do this.

770
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,889
They need help
over at the assisted-living center.

771
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:29,268
You get that job, stop loafing
around here like some princess,

772
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,480
and I will match what you earn,
penny for penny.

773
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:40,112
You would do that?

774
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,408
Why?

775
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,496
Because I'm your grandmother.

776
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:57,671
Oh, I don't think so.

777
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,757
The last time I ran anywhere
was to my wedding.

778
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,384
Look what happened.

779
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:03,969
I spent most of the next week in bed.

780
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,478
Is that Corinne?

781
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,064
- No.
- Who is it?

782
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,733
- Maggie.
- Have we met before?

783
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,737
There's a pick-up line with a little dust on it.

784
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,823
Fine. What's your sign?

785
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,075
I've been out of the game for a while.

786
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,203
What, like 70, 80 years?

787
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,039
Give or take.

788
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,667
Where's Corinne? She's my number-one girl.

789
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,336
Excuse me, but what
does Corinne have that I don't?

790
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:38,963
She reads to me.

791
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,925
You could do it.

792
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,761
Maybe nose her out of first position.

793
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,223
Here.

794
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:53,686
I'm a little busy right now.

795
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,939
Maybe you should wait for Corinne.

796
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,660
Hello.

797
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,037
Are the Sixers basketball or hockey?

798
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:18,752
Come on, Eric.

799
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,839
Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!

800
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,633
That's what I'm talking about.
Get back. Get back.

801
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,052
That's Reggie Miller. You gotta get him.

802
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:29,972
He'll make it every time.

803
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,141
Boo, that's right.

804
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,643
Boo! Good.

805
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:38,814
I can't believe we lost the game.

806
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:41,650
- Why? We've been losing all season long.
- That's right.

807
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:44,069
We need a three-point man,
a man who can shoot the pill.

808
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:47,490
I don't care if you have the best shooter,
you gotta get back on defense.

809
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:49,783
You need to put points on the boards too.

810
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:53,037
Look at the best teams in history.
The Celtics, the Bulls, the Lakers.

811
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,622
All great defensive teams.

812
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,166
Offense sells tickets,
but defense wins ball games.

813
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,960
- He's right. Without defense, you won't win.
- Thank you.

814
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,267
I see you're a fan of the classics.

815
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:17,937
Um...

816
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:19,688
What?

817
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,069
Oh, that. That... That's my sister's.

818
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,862
Oh, okay.

819
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:30,282
I hope you like cheap, almost stale red.

820
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,867
It's my favorite.

821
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,161
What's she like, the sister?

822
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:35,829
She's,

823
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,082
you know, a sister.

824
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,961
You don't wanna talk about your sister.

825
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:43,587
I didn't say that.

826
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,300
I don't wanna talk about my sister.

827
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:51,971
Cheers.

828
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,773
So, what's he like, this Captain Jack?

829
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:07,570
"His fingers tangled in her curls,

830
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:11,282
"while his tongue plundered
the soft cavern of her mouth.

831
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,534
"She made no protests.

832
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,911
"Her furnace was alight.

833
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,957
"Jack drew his lips from hers
and urged her forward,

834
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:24,086
"so he could take one shirt-veiled
nipple into his mouth.

835
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,214
"Kit's gasp urged him on.

836
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,719
"He licked the material
until it clung to the right peak,

837
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:36,098
"then drew the turgid flesh
deep into his mouth.

838
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:40,686
"Kit moaned,
her body spasming in response.

839
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,856
"Her eyes were closed, her lips parted."

840
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,694
Okay, um, embarrassing as this is to admit,

841
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,322
I'm officially turned on.

842
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,116
Does this mean that I'm your bitch?

843
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:21,620
Do you wanna be my bitch?

844
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:31,255
I have wanted to be your bitch
since my first day at Dommel.

845
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:36,802
That Chicago trip, I was convinced it was
all gonna come together for me there.

846
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:42,808
- Was I unfriendly?
- No. I mean, not compared to, say, Stalin.

847
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,730
I'm sorry.

848
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,900
I was hideous.

849
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,946
It's okay.
You have plenty of time to make it up to me.

850
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,670
Go, go, go.

851
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,675
Come on, come on.

852
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,387
Yes.

853
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:24,600
Yes!

854
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:28,061
Yes!

855
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,900
So how's it going with Hotsy-Tots?

856
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:34,485
Oh, fine.

857
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,862
"Fine," she says.

858
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,616
- What?
- There's no "fine" with grandkids.

859
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,786
It's either the best day of your life
or sheer torture.

860
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,537
What do you do together?

861
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,247
I don't know.

862
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:49,875
- We eat.
- That's it?

863
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:55,339
You gotta do things she likes to do.
Read the fashion magazines, surf the Net.

864
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,257
Watch the smut on the cable.

865
01:08:57,342 --> 01:09:00,302
- I don't have cable.
- No cable?

866
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,597
And she wonders why
she and the girl aren't all buddy-buddy.

867
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:09,061
I don't need television to build
a relationship with my granddaughter.

868
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:13,065
You're new to this.
Trust me, it's all about Surround Sound.

869
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:21,198
I just needed a little kiss
to make me feel better.

870
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:24,827
- But now it wasn't working.
- Thank you.

871
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,245
Maggie.

872
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:29,498
We're having Cosmopolitans.
Would you like one?

873
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:33,877
I wasn't getting the same rush.
Tonight, I needed more.

874
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:36,380
- No, thanks.
- Meanwhile, uptown,

875
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:39,633
Charlotte wondered when relationships
had gotten so complicated.

876
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:43,554
She yearned for the time when dinner
was followed by dessert, not lubricant.

877
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,431
Whoops.

878
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:50,602
I want to, but I can't.
I mean, actually, no, that's not true.

879
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,730
I don't want to. Or maybe I do.
I don't know what I want, but...

880
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,566
I've seen this one.

881
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:59,236
- I want children and nice bedding...
- It's funny.

882
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:01,196
And I just can't handle this right now.

883
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:05,033
That night, they made love
the Charlotte way. Polite...

884
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,619
- Oh, it was wonderful.
- I thought so.

885
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:10,539
- Now walk up straight, now.
- Thank you for everything.

886
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:14,334
- Have a very wonderful day.
- Yes, and have a good sleep and no sugar.

887
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,795
- And good night.
- Good night.

888
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:21,008
Well, yeah, okay.

889
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,635
Okay, thank you. Good night.

890
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,698
What's up with Lewis?

891
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:47,993
I don't know what you're talking about.

892
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,496
I say go for it.

893
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:53,665
- Just jump him.
- Maggie.

894
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,877
Don't talk like that. Here.

895
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:02,049
Half the fun of sex is talking about it.

896
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,676
Well, I guess I missed that half.

897
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,095
You never talked about sex?

898
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,308
Occasionally, with Ira.

899
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,602
Kind of.

900
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:16,313
Yeah, but what about girlfriends?

901
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,191
The first time you got laid.

902
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,777
You had to tell someone that.

903
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,905
It was my wedding night. It was assumed.

904
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:29,242
You missed out on one of the all-time
greatest conversations in life.

905
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,620
Who'd you tell?

906
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,748
Rose.

907
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,377
Well, maybe if I'd had a sister.

908
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:43,340
Even when you were so small, you had
a bond that I'd never had with anyone.

909
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:46,385
Still close like that?

910
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,390
- Sure.
- You don't talk about her.

911
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,517
What do you wanna hear?

912
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:58,522
We're totally fine. We're... We're tight.
We're thick as thieves.

913
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:01,733
Let's ask her down. I'd like to know her too.

914
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,903
You know, I doubt she would come.
She's, like...

915
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,364
Really busy. She's a lawyer.

916
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,241
No kidding. What kind?

917
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,368
The really busy kind.

918
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,330
What do you do once they've all peed?

919
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,957
Give them a brush,

920
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,794
take them all home,
make sure they have water to drink.

921
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:25,465
After that.

922
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,467
Then I'm done.

923
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,637
So, what do you do?

924
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,431
Whatever.

925
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,851
Shop for food, cook for my boyfriend.

926
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,311
- I know his name.
- I know.

927
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:41,898
But I've never had a real
live grown-up boyfriend before,

928
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,443
and I'm gonna use the word
as often as I can.

929
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:49,114
All right, first of all, he's not grown up.
None of them are.

930
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:54,870
You know, there's a consistency to
your cynicism which is truly beautiful.

931
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:59,958
Just don't be surprised
if he turns out to be less than perfect.

932
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,711
And don't be surprised if he doesn't.

933
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,340
- I gotta go.
- Goodbye.

934
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:08,967
- Have fun.
- I'll call you.

935
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,469
All right.

936
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:15,057
You sound too pretty,
Maggie, to be cleaning bedpans.

937
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:19,102
- You're right, I am.
- I have a grandson, a doctor over in Tampa.

938
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,771
I should introduce you.

939
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,314
You don't wanna do that.

940
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,107
Are you bad news?

941
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:27,694
You know, I don't mean to be, but yeah.

942
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:29,571
Well.

943
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:33,825
Since you're not gonna marry my grandson,
you might as well read to me.

944
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,584
- I'm kind of a slow reader.
- Perfect.

945
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,461
I'm a slow listener.

946
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:56,556
"The art

947
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:58,809

"losing..."

949
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:07,567
- You know, I should just get back to work.
- What is it, dyslexia?

950
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:11,154
- What are you, a teacher?
- Professor, retired.

951
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,032
Just take your time, Maggie.

952
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,618
Listen to the words
as you're about to say them.

953
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,287
Nine times out of 10,
you'll hear a mistake coming

954
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,540
and you'll correct it before you make it.

955
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:24,584
Then again, you might make
a total ass of yourself.

956
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,229
Oh, come on.

957
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:47,357
Poetry's supposed to be slow.

958
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:03,456
"The art of

959
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:05,625

Well, what do you think?

993
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,258
Good.

994
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,093
Unacceptable answer.

995
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:22,262
What's the poem about?

996
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:26,516
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. What's it about?

997
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,271
- Losing.
- What?

998
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,526
- Love?
- Ah.

999
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:38,570
And how about that?

1000
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:42,115
Is the love lost already?

1001
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:47,412
Is Bishop writing about it as a
possibility, a probability? What?

1002
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,291
Well,

1003
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:57,255
in the beginning, she's talking
about losing real things.

1004
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,300
Like her keys.

1005
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:04,554
And then she... She gets, like...

1006
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:09,434
- She lost a continent.
- She's getting grandiose.

1007
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:10,769
Yeah.

1008
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:14,981
And the way she says it, is like...
Like it doesn't matter.

1009
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,274
Ah.

1010
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,778
Her tone, would you call it detached?

1011
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:24,616
I think she wants to sound detached.

1012
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:28,536
You know, she wants to sound

1013
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:33,041
like it doesn't matter,
because she knows deep down

1014
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:36,461
how bad it's gonna feel to lose.

1015
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,338
Lose what?

1016
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:42,133
Or whom?

1017
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,345
Is it a lover?

1018
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:51,309
No.

1019
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:58,441
It's a friend.

1020
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,155
A-plus.

1021
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,492
Smart girl.

1022
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:31,516
- This is Sydelle.
- Oh, what a comfortable home.

1023
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:34,436
Very, uh, lived-in.

1024
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,355
- Well, what can I get you?
- I'll have a white wine.

1025
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,524
- And he'll have the same.
- Oh, good.

1026
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:43,528
And why don't you just make yourself
at home, and I'll be right back.

1027
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:47,240
- Hey, Dad.
- Rosie.

1028
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:50,326
- Where's Maggie?
- Oh, not here.

1029
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,620
Oh, thank God.
We don't need her drama tonight.

1030
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:56,124
- Why isn't she here? Is something wrong?
- No, we just, you know, had a fight.

1031
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:57,792
About what?

1032
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:00,628
- Can we talk about this later?
- Yes.

1033
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:03,506
Bad enough she monopolizes
the evening when she's here.

1034
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:06,217
Oh, let me see that ring.

1035
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:11,556
Oh, wow, look at that.

1036
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,894
For you. For you, sweetie.

1037
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,146
Rose tells me you have
a daughter as well, Sydelle.

1038
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,482
My Marcia? You'll meet her.

1039
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,567
You'll love her. Everyone does.

1040
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,944
- My Marcia's a decorator.
- Really?

1041
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:27,739
She's absolutely
genius in her work.

1042
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,200
I'd like to say a few words.

1043
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:33,786
Please. To Rose and Simon.

1044
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,707
We're all blessed to be a part
of your happiness.

1045
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,959
Your love bonds not just your two hearts,

1046
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:44,255
but the hearts of two families. Mazel tov.

1047
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:47,091
- Mazel tov.
- Mazel tov.

1048
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,468
Thanks, Dad.

1049
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,261
- That went okay.
- Yeah.

1050
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,388
Where's Maggie?

1051
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:55,016
It's hard to say, you know?
She moves around a lot.

1052
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,310
Well, I wanna meet her eventually.
You know?

1053
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,437
She's your sister. I wanna know her.

1054
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,064
You will.

1055
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,191
What was the fight about?

1056
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,027
Girl stuff.

1057
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,869
Oh, shit.

1058
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:17,455
Oh!

1059
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:22,085
I should have used fresh vegetables
instead of frozen.

1060
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:25,421
I don't think so. They were great.
Really delicious.

1061
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:26,839
- They were good.
- Really?

1062
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,383
Yes.

1063
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,969
So have you heard from Rose?

1064
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,639
- No.
- So she hasn't gotten back to you?

1065
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,266
About what?

1066
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,643
You were going to invite her down, Maggie.

1067
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:43,773
- I don't know where you got that idea.
- Maggie, I specifically asked you to.

1068
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:47,485
So? Just because you specifically asked,
doesn't mean I'm going to.

1069
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:50,822
You shouldn't smoke.
You have a family history of lung cancer.

1070
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:54,993
I have a family history of car wrecks too.
Does that mean I shouldn't drive?

1071
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,580
- That is not funny.
- It wasn't supposed to be.

1072
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,498
What is the problem between you and Rose?

1073
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:03,585
- Why don't you want her to visit?
- Why do you?

1074
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:06,504
I mean, am I not good enough for you?

1075
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,423
This has nothing to do with you.

1076
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:12,510
She's my daughter's daughter,
and I wanna get to know her too.

1077
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,529
What was Caroline like with you girls?

1078
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:34,198
I mean, as a mom,
how do you remember her?

1079
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:36,034
Why don't you ask Rose?

1080
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,036
Maggie,

1081
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:40,246
please grow up.

1082
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:50,256
She was special,
different than the other moms.

1083
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:53,092
She used to surprise us.

1084
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:57,764
One time I opened up my lunchbox

1085
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:01,726
and there was a tiara inside.

1086
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,438
A tiara? With your sandwich?

1087
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,315
Instead of a sandwich.

1088
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:11,319
What was she like as a daughter?

1089
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,405
No tiaras.

1090
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:19,535
But I loved her so much.

1091
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:27,710
Loving her in the right way
was difficult, for me anyway.

1092
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,546
I didn't know there was a right way
and a wrong way.

1093
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,256
Neither did I.

1094
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:35,051
I had ideas.

1095
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:40,390
I had unwelcomed ideas
about how to keep her safe.

1096
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,058
- Like?
- Like

1097
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:45,895
I thought she should have been
on her medication all the time.

1098
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:48,690
I thought that her relationship
with your father was

1099
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:52,819
far too passionate for her to handle.
And as far as children are concerned,

1100
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,114
she was in no condition, no condition at all.

1101
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:58,199
So you wish she'd never had me?

1102
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:04,122
You know what I wish, Maggie?

1103
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:10,962
I wish I had kept my big mouth shut long
enough to hear what she wanted out of life.

1104
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:20,096
Hmm.

1105
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:24,058
There she is. There's the bride.

1106
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:26,644
Be strong.

1107
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,481
Stay right here.

1108
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,358
I'll get your corsage.

1109
01:24:33,444 --> 01:24:35,778
Corsage? What is this, a prom?

1110
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:37,905
- Ladies.
- Oh, thank you.

1111
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,201
Who are these people?

1112
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:45,580
I have no idea, except for my Marcia.

1113
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,081
Hello.

1114
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:49,792
Hey.

1115
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:54,172
You're not sticking around to watch me
"ooh" and "ah" over a Mixmaster Deluxe?

1116
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,133
It's good of you to let Sydelle do this.

1117
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:59,343
Like gale-force winds could stop her.

1118
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:02,972
Go easy on her. Marcia's giving her
a very hard time these days.

1119
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:06,559
Oh, what's she doing?
Decorating in last year's colors?

1120
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:09,187
She joined Jews for Jesus.

1121
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:19,781
Yoo-hoo, ladies, it's time for the
entertainment portion of our soiree.

1122
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:24,076
Everyone get where you can see. Anita?
Jackie, come on. Scoot.

1123
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,412
Here we go.

1124
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,372
Aww.

1125
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:34,212
We who know Rose are so thrilled
that this day has finally arrived.

1126
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:38,841
There was a time we had our doubts.

1127
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,095
Oh, my goodness.

1128
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:46,349
All that time spent with her nose
buried in her book.

1129
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:52,271
- Bookworm.
- Of course there were romances.

1130
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:55,525
But for some reason or other, nothing stuck.

1131
01:25:56,527 --> 01:25:58,069
So heavy.

1132
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:02,740
Oh, one thing Rose always
had was a great appetite

1133
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:05,368
for life.

1134
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:19,882
God. Why would anyone wanna marry me?
I'm disgusting.

1135
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:23,511
The only disgusting person here
is your stepmother. She's hideous.

1136
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,471
So why is she giving me this party?

1137
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:26,931
She hates me.

1138
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:31,143
Someone else should do it. Someone who
loves me. Someone who can look at me

1139
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,731
and say, "All of this is nothing more
than the happiness you deserve."

1140
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:39,694
Young lady.
Rose Feller, don't you dare walk out...

1141
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:41,237
I am talking to my friend!

1142
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:45,366
She's crazy. She's crazy.
She's sick in the head.

1143
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:59,130
Hands down, best shower I've ever been to.

1144
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:10,016
Engagement should be a happy time, Rosie.

1145
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:14,312
So should childhood and graduation
and happy hour.

1146
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:19,108
Did you know more suicides happen during
happy hour than any other time of day?

1147
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,736
- Is that true?
- I wouldn't doubt it.

1148
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:26,824
I love you, you know.

1149
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:46,052
- Who's Rose?
- There's this thing called privacy, Dora.

1150
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:55,061
This from a girl who puts a postage stamp
on her bottom and calls it a swimsuit.

1151
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:13,556
The number
you have called is no longer in service.

1152
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,517
If you feel you have
reached this recording in error...

1153
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:35,953
Hey.

1154
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,208
Are you dead?

1155
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:44,295
What were you thinking, going to the mall?

1156
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,797
The mall is for young people,
people with teeth.

1157
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:49,884
Well, my son's finally getting married,
and the girl's a ninny.

1158
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:53,804
"Shut up, Ma," he says.
"Just show up in something nice."

1159
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:56,223
- You know what I saw today?
- What?

1160
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:59,226
Pants with "Juicy"
written across the heinie.

1161
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:03,105
- I'm gonna wear that?
- Just wear something you're comfortable in.

1162
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:06,901
I haven't been comfortable
since the Dodgers left Brooklyn.

1163
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:11,989
What's your favorite thing you ever wore?

1164
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:14,658
- Ever?
- Yeah. In your whole life.

1165
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,787
My going-away suit from my wedding.

1166
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,998
Black-and-white checks, very fitted.

1167
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:24,085
I felt like Jackie Kennedy in that suit.

1168
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:31,592
Give me your credit card.

1169
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:33,844
Give it to me.

1170
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:40,017
Can I get you a size?

1171
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:46,857
No, I'm going to the
women's suit department.

1172
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:01,080
So?

1173
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:04,208
Jackie Kennedy?

1174
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:07,044
Better. Jackie Onassis.

1175
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,716
That looks so good on you.

1176
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,635
You're so great.

1177
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:15,970
Good job.

1178
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:24,562
You ready?

1179
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:26,981
I don't know what to wear
to a mainline wedding.

1180
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:31,110
- Doesn't matter, wear whatever you want.
- When the bride's name is Lopey, it matters.

1181
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,320
Look. That looks great. Come on.

1182
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:35,698
- Really?
- Yeah. Come on, we gotta go.

1183
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,032
Okay.

1184
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:40,411
I can't believe you have a friend
named Lopey.

1185
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,873
- Come on, come on.
- I'm sorry. Wait.

1186
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:52,756
Are you okay? Because if there's gonna be
any stabbing, I need a little heads-up.

1187
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:54,341
I'm fine.

1188
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,139
Oh, my God.

1189
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:03,642
Oh, shit, my Jimmy Choos.

1190
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:08,314
Chewing gum?

1191
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:11,442
Oh, that bitch. That bitch!

1192
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:14,778
- Okay, no one will notice.
- Right, no one's gonna notice that.

1193
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:16,155
"Hi, hi. Hi.

1194
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:19,241
"Hi. I can talk because I have a mouth."
My heel has a mouth.

1195
01:32:19,326 --> 01:32:20,951
No one will notice.

1196
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:22,536
Oh, my God.

1197
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:24,914
What happened to your heel?

1198
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:31,629
Hi.

1199
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,964
Best wishes, Lopey, Jordan.

1200
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:35,883
Thanks, Simon.

1201
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:40,137
"Let the wind die down.

1202
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:44,642
"Let the shed go black inside.

1203
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:47,353
"Let evening come.

1204
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:51,398
"To the bottle in the ditch.

1205
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:56,654
"To the scoop in the oats.

1206
01:32:58,198 --> 01:33:02,034
"To air in the lung.

1207
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,164
"Let evening come."

1208
01:33:17,259 --> 01:33:18,759
Can I take that for you?

1209
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:21,262
I hear you're getting married.

1210
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:23,347
Congratulations.

1211
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,768
Congratulations are for the groom.

1212
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,354
You say "best wishes" to the bride.

1213
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:33,190
Guess my manners
aren't what they should be.

1214
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:35,192
Gee, really?

1215
01:33:36,528 --> 01:33:39,113
Rose, I am really sorry.

1216
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:42,700
I felt horrible about myself
for two solid months.

1217
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,077
I felt horrible about myself my whole life,

1218
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:47,162
so you'll get no sympathy from me.

1219
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:54,920
You know what they called me growing up?

1220
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:58,549
"Fudgy the Whale."

1221
01:33:59,718 --> 01:34:01,969
I'm still shocked when a woman wants me

1222
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:06,390
and sometimes I do really stupid things,
because I can't believe I can.

1223
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:10,227
- The thing with your sister...
- Was inexcusable.

1224
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:14,231
No matter what you weighed in high school.

1225
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,900
You ruined everything.

1226
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:19,570
I know.

1227
01:34:21,031 --> 01:34:22,323
What we had

1228
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:24,283
was really special.

1229
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:29,705
Oh, please. "What we..."?

1230
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:36,962
Because of you,
I have no idea where my sister is.

1231
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:41,967
I can't reach her. Her phone's cut off.
She doesn't even know I'm engaged.

1232
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:45,095
My own sister. My best friend.

1233
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:50,100
And the worst part is,
I can't talk to anyone about it.

1234
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:55,773
If I tell my father, he'll get all panicked and
mad at me for not taking better care of her.

1235
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:58,275
And if I tell Simon...

1236
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:00,778
I can't tell Simon.

1237
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:02,905
Why not?

1238
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:04,823
Because.

1239
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:08,702
He'll hate her.

1240
01:35:10,914 --> 01:35:13,248
And that, I couldn't bear.

1241
01:35:25,512 --> 01:35:26,762
Hi, Jim.

1242
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:31,308
Here I am, trying to be patient,

1243
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:34,645
trying to be understanding
while you lose your freaking mind.

1244
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:35,896
I'm not losing my mind.

1245
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:38,899
Ping-ponging between comatose
and homicidal.

1246
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:41,026
God, every day I wake up thinking,

1247
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,362
- "Maybe today's the day she'll come back."
- I'm right here.

1248
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:45,906
"Maybe today she'll look at me
like she used to.

1249
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:49,910
"She'll look at me in the eye
and tell me what she's thinking."

1250
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:52,371
- Simon?
- But, no. No, no.

1251
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:54,998
Today's the day you look him in the eye

1252
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:58,335
and tell him what you're thinking.
The guy who treated you like a...

1253
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:01,338
Like a disposable washrag.

1254
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:29,533
This has nothing to do with him.

1255
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:31,994
This is about you and me.

1256
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:37,541
You not talking to me, you not telling me
what's going on inside you.

1257
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:40,961
Tell me.

1258
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,971
I won't marry you like this.

1259
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:54,433
I won't do it.

1260
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:13,660
So this lady today, she, um...

1261
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:16,163
She heard about how I shopped
for Mrs. Lefkowitz

1262
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:18,248
and she asked if I'd do the same for her.

1263
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:20,167
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

1264
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:24,421
- She said she'd pay.
- Well, she better.

1265
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:33,388
Do you think there's other women
down here who would?

1266
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:34,973
Are you kidding? Scads.

1267
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:41,730
I was thinking of doing it
maybe like a business.

1268
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:47,778
Well, that's an excellent idea.

1269
01:37:51,241 --> 01:37:52,491
I'm...

1270
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:54,952
I'm really terrible at numbers.

1271
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:57,454
I mean, adding and stuff.

1272
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:02,668
Well, I'm good with them. I can help.

1273
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:07,881
I mean, if you like.

1274
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:13,262
Yeah, sure.

1275
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:20,227
That'd be good.

1276
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:24,064
Gin.

1277
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:55,012
- Oh, no.
- Dad?

1278
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:59,433
- Dad?
- You are not welcome here.

1279
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:03,270
- Rose? You all right?
- Are you kidding? I'm fantastic.

1280
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:05,606
Turns out I have a grandmother
I never knew about.

1281
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:07,733
It was in your own best interest.
Your father...

1282
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,568
Why are you speaking?

1283
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:11,695
You do not have any place
in this conversation.

1284
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:14,656
- Excuse me, miss, this is my house.
- Sydelle.

1285
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:16,283
Please.

1286
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,167
How did she find you?

1287
01:39:26,878 --> 01:39:28,754
How did she lose me?

1288
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:35,510
She said she sent birthday cards.
Please tell me you never got them.

1289
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:41,808
Our mother was dead.
Our father was practically catatonic.

1290
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:46,104
- A grandmother might have come in handy.
- She was impossible, Rose.

1291
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:48,065
Bossy. Self-righteous.

1292
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:51,485
Nosy about things
that weren't her business.

1293
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,237
- Like what?
- Trust me, we were better off without her.

1294
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:56,365
Because she was bossy?
That doesn't make sense.

1295
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:58,950
I didn't wanna be around that.
I didn't want you around it.

1296
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:00,911
- What?
- The judgment, the blame.

1297
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:03,121
For what? What did...
What did she blame you for?

1298
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:05,165
- Everything.
- What everything?

1299
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:06,667
- Just everything.
- Dad?

1300
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,835
For your mother, all right?

1301
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:10,754
For her death.

1302
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:17,803
- She said that?
- She didn't have to.

1303
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:23,266
She wanted her protected all the time.

1304
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:24,851
Drugged.

1305
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:28,105
But Caroline,
she didn't want to live that way.

1306
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:30,524
It made her foggy.

1307
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:33,777
She couldn't take it if she was pregnant.

1308
01:40:33,903 --> 01:40:35,237
So,

1309
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:38,990
we hoped it would be enough,
loving each other,

1310
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:41,576
loving you and Maggie.

1311
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:45,664
There were so many good days.

1312
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,793
We thought it would be okay.

1313
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:52,379
Oh, God.

1314
01:40:53,131 --> 01:40:54,798
I'm sorry, Rosie.

1315
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:57,968
I'm so sorry.

1316
01:40:59,429 --> 01:41:01,138
Now, um,

1317
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:06,059
the only opening on Thursday
she has is 5:00.

1318
01:41:06,144 --> 01:41:07,227
- P.M?
- Yes.

1319
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:09,354
That's right in the middle of dinner.

1320
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:12,023
- Well, take it or leave it.
- I'll take it if she won't.

1321
01:41:12,108 --> 01:41:14,943
- I'll take it. I'll take it.
- Mrs. Stempel.

1322
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:16,862
- Ella.
- Lewis.

1323
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,948
Are you looking for a personal shopper too?

1324
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:21,575
No. A date.

1325
01:41:21,993 --> 01:41:24,828
To the tea dance,
and I'd be honored if you go with me.

1326
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,501
- I'd love to.
- Pick you up at 4.

1327
01:41:36,215 --> 01:41:37,716
Lewis Feldman.

1328
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:51,730
This place just keeps getting
better and better.

1329
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,172
What are you doing here?

1330
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:22,594
I live here. What are you doing here?

1331
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,597
You live here? In an old folks' home?

1332
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:29,893
It's a retirement community
for active seniors.

1333
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:33,438
Wait, so you...
You live with our grandmother?

1334
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:38,401
How'd you find out about her?

1335
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:42,906
I can't believe she wrote you
without telling me.

1336
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:46,743
That's so sneaky.

1337
01:42:48,246 --> 01:42:51,248
Does it offend your strict moral code?

1338
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:57,170
So how's it going for you down here?

1339
01:42:57,255 --> 01:42:59,381
Who's buying your cocktails?

1340
01:43:00,883 --> 01:43:02,092
No one.

1341
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:05,762
Oh, no. Is your mojo failing you already?

1342
01:43:05,847 --> 01:43:07,264
My mojo's fine.

1343
01:43:08,099 --> 01:43:10,016
Just haven't felt like drinking.

1344
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:12,936
Right. Probably haven't felt like stealing

1345
01:43:13,062 --> 01:43:17,065
or lying or having sex
with inappropriate partners, either.

1346
01:43:19,277 --> 01:43:22,070
Did you come down here just to abuse me?

1347
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:26,491
Maggie. I hope you are prepared
to be exceedingly rich,

1348
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:28,743
because I've booked you within an...

1349
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:32,122
Rose.

1350
01:43:35,793 --> 01:43:37,043
Oh, Rose.

1351
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,129
Look at you.

1352
01:43:39,338 --> 01:43:41,965
Oh, look how lovely you are.

1353
01:43:47,513 --> 01:43:49,264
Do you remember me?

1354
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:51,391
Yeah.

1355
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:54,019
I remember you too.

1356
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:59,024
You're exactly the same,
smiley and huggable and...

1357
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:02,235
- Ooh, and engaged?
- What?

1358
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,778
Oh, yeah.

1359
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:05,739
Holy shit.

1360
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:08,325
- To who?
- No one you know.

1361
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:09,701
Champagne.

1362
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:12,579
Now come with me. Tell me all about it.

1363
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:20,170
I can't believe you're marrying somebody
I haven't even met.

1364
01:44:24,926 --> 01:44:26,801
What's he like anyhow?

1365
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:32,724
Why, you wanna screw him too?

1366
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:39,940
I don't expect you to forgive me, Rose.

1367
01:44:44,403 --> 01:44:46,154
But I am sorry.

1368
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:58,166
- Careful, Mrs. Haskell.
- I'm always careful.

1369
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:01,503
She hit somebody last week.
It was a big to-do.

1370
01:45:02,088 --> 01:45:05,924
And there's a store where you can buy
eight different kinds of hemorrhoid creams.

1371
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:10,553
Oh, and here come the queen bees.
Widows, they run the place.

1372
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:13,890
Oh, watch out. Hello, ladies.
This is my sister.

1373
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:15,517
- Maggie.
- Hi.

1374
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:18,019
- Hi, Maggie.
- Yep. Have a good day.

1375
01:45:18,104 --> 01:45:19,729
Pretty girl too.

1376
01:45:20,398 --> 01:45:23,024
This is the exercise pavilion. Hey, guys.

1377
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:25,026
- Hi, Maggie.
- This is my sister, Rose.

1378
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:26,861
Hello, Rose.

1379
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,365
A good stretch. That's it.

1380
01:45:30,533 --> 01:45:32,993
- And left. Right.
- Looking good, Mrs. Klein.

1381
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,661
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi, ladies.

1382
01:45:34,829 --> 01:45:37,414
- Hi.
- Gonna repeat it now. Come on.

1383
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:40,583
I call these guys "The Bench."
They're all former lawyers.

1384
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,003
Gentlemen. Hey.

1385
01:45:43,421 --> 01:45:45,672
- Hi, Maggie.
- This is my sister, Rose.

1386
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:48,675
- She's a lawyer, too, from Philadelphia.
- Which firm?

1387
01:45:48,884 --> 01:45:50,969
Actually, no firm right now.

1388
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:53,805
I'm just taking some time off.

1389
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:55,432
Me too.

1390
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:05,316
What are you doing, Ella?

1391
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,110
Sit down, girls.

1392
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:10,488
I've got some things here
I thought you might like to see.

1393
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,200
God.

1394
01:46:15,995 --> 01:46:17,704
- Look at you.
- These are great.

1395
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:20,623
Hey, look, our old living room.

1396
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,127
Oh, God.

1397
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:27,172
Can Mom have been any prettier?

1398
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:30,300
Oh, you look exactly like her. Doesn't she?

1399
01:46:30,468 --> 01:46:33,386
- I wonder if there's a picture of Honey Bun.
- That'd be pretty impossible.

1400
01:46:33,471 --> 01:46:34,846
- Who's Honey Bun?
- Our dog.

1401
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:36,639
- You had a dog?
- For one day.

1402
01:46:36,724 --> 01:46:38,308
The greatest day.

1403
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:42,812
Mom woke us up really early.
It was a school day. It was still dark out.

1404
01:46:43,064 --> 01:46:46,441
- It was winter.
- And she put us in our best party dresses

1405
01:46:46,525 --> 01:46:49,319
- and dragged us to the kitchen, which was...
- A mess.

1406
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:52,989
Covered, every counter, in fudge.
She'd been up all night making it.

1407
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:56,659
We loaded it into the car,
and she drove us right past school,

1408
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,620
straight up to New York,
to Lord and Taylor...

1409
01:46:58,704 --> 01:47:00,497
Which was closed,
because we got there at 8 a.m.

1410
01:47:00,581 --> 01:47:04,334
- That's right, and we hung out in the car.
- Eating fudge for breakfast.

1411
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:07,087
Mom had heard about Mrs. Fields,
the cookie lady.

1412
01:47:07,296 --> 01:47:10,840
And she figured that her fudge
was just as good as those cookies. So...

1413
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:12,884
So she was gonna make a fortune.

1414
01:47:12,968 --> 01:47:16,179
When it finally opened, we went in and...
Oh, God.

1415
01:47:16,514 --> 01:47:18,181
She was so beautiful.

1416
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:22,060
- She was wearing this long velvety gown.
- At 8 in the morning?

1417
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:23,645
Oh, by this time it was 10.

1418
01:47:23,729 --> 01:47:26,106
I guess she talked to some
of the store people about the fudge.

1419
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:27,732
But I don't remember.

1420
01:47:27,817 --> 01:47:32,529
She spilled it all over the jewelry counter.
There was a guy who just looked at her.

1421
01:47:33,322 --> 01:47:35,198
I don't remember a guy.

1422
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:38,076
There was a guy, and he looked at her.

1423
01:47:40,037 --> 01:47:43,373
Anyway, Mom said that we could
each get one present.

1424
01:47:43,499 --> 01:47:46,042
- And you got...
- A Nancy Drew book.

1425
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,753
I asked for a puppy... And she got it!

1426
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:53,383
He was so cute. I named him Honey Bun.

1427
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:56,469
Why'd you only have it for one day?

1428
01:47:56,762 --> 01:47:58,596
I guess Dad thought
it was a bad idea.

1429
01:47:58,681 --> 01:47:59,722
Why?

1430
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:02,642
I don't know.
I think he thought I was too young.

1431
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,894
No, he was just mad.

1432
01:48:05,938 --> 01:48:07,313
About a dog?

1433
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:09,524
Oh, about the whole day.

1434
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:13,194
He didn't have any idea where we were,
and school had called.

1435
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:14,571
Oh.

1436
01:48:14,947 --> 01:48:16,156
Really?

1437
01:48:16,866 --> 01:48:20,660
Yeah. He was really panicked
and really, really mad at her.

1438
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:22,787
They had a huge fight.

1439
01:48:22,955 --> 01:48:24,789
I don't remember a fight.

1440
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:28,418
You were in your room
with a record playing.

1441
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:30,879
- I was?
- Yeah.

1442
01:48:32,173 --> 01:48:35,592
I put you in there and turned the music on,
so you wouldn't hear them.

1443
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:38,636
Why? What were they saying?

1444
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:44,642
He was saying

1445
01:48:46,312 --> 01:48:47,937
she was "unfit."

1446
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:50,899
That's the word he used.

1447
01:48:52,193 --> 01:48:53,693
He said he was gonna

1448
01:48:53,861 --> 01:48:57,572
send her away, put her away, something.
Kept saying "away."

1449
01:48:58,782 --> 01:49:00,450
And her?

1450
01:49:00,618 --> 01:49:03,036
"There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm a good mother."

1451
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:06,247
He'd say, "Away,"
and she'd say, "I'm their mother."

1452
01:49:06,332 --> 01:49:09,459
So he was...
He was gonna have her hospitalized?

1453
01:49:11,587 --> 01:49:13,004
Yeah.

1454
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:23,056
Oh, God, the poor guy.

1455
01:49:26,644 --> 01:49:28,519
When exactly was this?

1456
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:30,688
November 3rd.

1457
01:49:32,608 --> 01:49:35,193
No. No, it wasn't. It was like...

1458
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:37,862
- Months before that.
- It was two days.

1459
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:41,783
It was Tuesday, and she died that Thursday.

1460
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:54,295
It was on purpose, wasn't it?

1461
01:49:57,049 --> 01:49:58,883
The car. The tree.

1462
01:50:05,057 --> 01:50:07,433
Was it even raining that night?

1463
01:50:11,105 --> 01:50:12,855
You were so little.

1464
01:50:15,025 --> 01:50:18,319
How do you tell a 6-year-old
her mom left by choice?

1465
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:27,453
Who told you?

1466
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:33,126
No one.

1467
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:45,722
Oh, God, why can't I just stay mad at you?

1468
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:49,017
Because we're a pair.

1469
01:50:49,476 --> 01:50:52,020
- Like Sonny and Cher.
- They split up.

1470
01:50:52,813 --> 01:50:54,772
But they remained quite close.

1471
01:51:06,952 --> 01:51:08,953
I'm not engaged anymore.

1472
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:15,043
Simon dumped me.

1473
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:23,968
Why are you still wearing the ring?

1474
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:28,556
I like how it feels.

1475
01:51:32,436 --> 01:51:34,937
- Do you know his name?
- Simon Stein.

1476
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:37,815
- Doctor?
- Lawyer.

1477
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,150
Oh, nice.

1478
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:43,112
So you call information,
"Simon Stein in Philly."

1479
01:51:43,197 --> 01:51:45,198
Get his number. Make a call.

1480
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:48,576
And say what?
"Hey, jerk, you broke my sister's heart.

1481
01:51:48,952 --> 01:51:52,121
- "Come down here and make it right"?
- Maybe not that, word for word.

1482
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:54,207
He broke up with her.
He's not gonna wanna come.

1483
01:51:54,291 --> 01:51:57,335
You don't know that.
Men can be very confused.

1484
01:51:57,461 --> 01:52:01,631
Yeah, too many options.
Be an astronaut, be a playboy.

1485
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:05,134
Often a man needs help
making the right choice.

1486
01:52:05,594 --> 01:52:08,471
How am I supposed to help him?
He doesn't even know me.

1487
01:52:08,597 --> 01:52:09,972
He knows your sister.

1488
01:52:10,182 --> 01:52:13,351
And loves her, or he wouldn't have
proposed in the first place.

1489
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:18,314
- So?
- So, what if he learned she was in trouble?

1490
01:52:19,024 --> 01:52:20,525
Or sick?

1491
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:22,777
Or pregnant.

1492
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:25,655
Dora.

1493
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:27,740
Don't look so shocked,

1494
01:52:27,825 --> 01:52:31,244
Miss Come-to-Florida-to-Milk-
Your-Grandmother-for-All-She's-Worth.

1495
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:32,954
We know all about you.

1496
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:44,132
So, dog walking?

1497
01:52:44,216 --> 01:52:46,300
Oh, don't worry about it. It's not forever.

1498
01:52:46,635 --> 01:52:49,720
It's just to keep me busy
till I figure out my next move.

1499
01:52:49,972 --> 01:52:52,849
Well, when you figure it out,
I hope you'll let me know.

1500
01:52:53,016 --> 01:52:56,936
You know, down here, if you don't have
successful grandchildren to brag about,

1501
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,604
you're screwed.

1502
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:02,400
What are we reading today?
A little Emily Dick, a little...

1503
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:26,507
Did they move him?

1504
01:53:29,595 --> 01:53:30,845
He died.

1505
01:53:31,597 --> 01:53:33,055
This morning.

1506
01:53:41,857 --> 01:53:43,065
Bummer.

1507
01:53:45,402 --> 01:53:48,946
- Were you on duty?
- No, I... I don't work here.

1508
01:53:49,031 --> 01:53:52,033
- This is his chart...
- You're his grandson.

1509
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,243
The doctor.

1510
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,456
Who are you?

1511
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:03,920
Nobody. I just... I read to him sometimes.

1512
01:54:07,466 --> 01:54:08,925
You're Maggie.

1513
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:13,471
He talked about me?

1514
01:54:16,642 --> 01:54:18,059
Just a little.

1515
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:56,347
- Hey.
- Hey.

1516
01:54:56,557 --> 01:54:58,307
Who's Fred Astaire?

1517
01:55:02,104 --> 01:55:03,771
That's Lewis.

1518
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:08,526
You're a very good dancer, Lewis.

1519
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:12,071
Know what else I'm good at?

1520
01:55:26,003 --> 01:55:27,169
Simon.

1521
01:55:28,171 --> 01:55:30,131
What are you doing here?

1522
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:32,967
I came as soon as your sister called.

1523
01:55:39,182 --> 01:55:41,142
Should you be drinking?

1524
01:55:57,326 --> 01:55:59,452
- So you're not pregnant?
- No.

1525
01:55:59,953 --> 01:56:01,996
- Never were?
- Don't you think I'd tell you

1526
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:05,082
- if I were pregnant?
- I don't know. You know, I hope so, but...

1527
01:56:05,167 --> 01:56:08,169
Frankly, there were a lot of things
you weren't telling me back there.

1528
01:56:11,965 --> 01:56:15,801
I promise, anything I kept from you
had nothing to do with us.

1529
01:56:17,012 --> 01:56:18,763
It was about Maggie.

1530
01:56:20,098 --> 01:56:23,184
I was protecting her,
because that's what I do.

1531
01:56:24,186 --> 01:56:26,896
You need to know this, because if by some

1532
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:30,566
insane stroke of fate
you do decide to marry me,

1533
01:56:30,734 --> 01:56:33,361
she will make your life a living hell.

1534
01:56:34,029 --> 01:56:38,032
You'll be begging me to kick her out,
commit her, kill her, anything.

1535
01:56:38,241 --> 01:56:39,909
And I'll want to.

1536
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:42,078
But I never will.

1537
01:56:44,373 --> 01:56:46,123
Because without her,

1538
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:49,460
I don't make sense.

1539
01:56:54,549 --> 01:56:56,050
You look good.

1540
01:56:57,094 --> 01:56:58,761
You look like you.

1541
01:57:09,189 --> 01:57:10,981
I can't believe I'm in Florida.

1542
01:57:15,570 --> 01:57:17,363
- You'll come back?
- Yes, I promise.

1543
01:57:17,447 --> 01:57:18,989
- Now, you hold her to it.
- I will.

1544
01:57:19,074 --> 01:57:20,908
Okay, don't buy a wedding dress.

1545
01:57:20,992 --> 01:57:23,119
It's gonna be my gift to you.

1546
01:57:23,787 --> 01:57:27,748
No way. You'll have me in some
hoochie-mama monstrosity.

1547
01:57:28,542 --> 01:57:31,293
Look, I'm good at this. Trust me.

1548
01:57:39,219 --> 01:57:41,303
Are you sure this is the right place?

1549
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:44,056
Only one Jerk Hut in Philadelphia,
ma'am.

1550
01:58:01,241 --> 01:58:03,325
- Michael.
- Ella.

1551
01:58:06,246 --> 01:58:08,497
This is my friend Lewis Feldman.

1552
01:58:08,832 --> 01:58:11,542
Lewis, this is Michael Feller,
father of the bride.

1553
01:58:11,626 --> 01:58:13,836
Pleased to meet you. Welcome.

1554
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:16,505
Rose will be so glad you're here.

1555
01:58:16,715 --> 01:58:18,090
Ella!

1556
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:22,178
Oh.

1557
01:58:22,262 --> 01:58:23,846
I'm so glad you're here.

1558
01:58:24,055 --> 01:58:25,598
Are you excited?

1559
01:58:25,682 --> 01:58:27,808
- Yeah.
- Yes? Perfect.

1560
01:58:27,893 --> 01:58:30,478
She gets really mad
if you leave the lid off the ice cream.

1561
01:58:30,562 --> 01:58:32,605
- I know.
- Don't even think

1562
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:35,316
- about using her toothbrush.
- No.

1563
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:37,902
- And she hates the look of raw chicken.
- I know.

1564
01:58:38,028 --> 01:58:42,865
And if she starts humming Hava Nagila,
she's, like, really, really mad. Like, mad.

1565
01:58:42,991 --> 01:58:44,617
Maggie, I know.

1566
01:58:45,285 --> 01:58:46,702
I know her.

1567
01:58:49,581 --> 01:58:51,665
- Okay.
- Okay.

1568
01:58:54,252 --> 01:58:56,420
I wore them in 1952.

1569
01:58:59,132 --> 01:59:01,133
- Old.
- But not to you.

1570
01:59:01,718 --> 01:59:04,512
- Right.
- And if I didn't give them to you?

1571
01:59:04,888 --> 01:59:07,598
- Borrowed.
- Okay. Look at the flowers.

1572
01:59:08,934 --> 01:59:10,392
- Blue.
- Yeah.

1573
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:13,187
So, Simon...

1574
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:19,568
I'll be back in a few minutes.

1575
01:59:29,788 --> 01:59:31,747
They are so loved.

1576
01:59:34,543 --> 01:59:36,585
You should be very proud.

1577
01:59:38,505 --> 01:59:40,881
I'm afraid I can't take much credit.

1578
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:45,803
Well, it's not always easy
taking care of yourself

1579
01:59:45,887 --> 01:59:48,305
and someone else at the same time.

1580
01:59:53,436 --> 01:59:55,563
I owe you an apology, Ella.

1581
02:00:00,277 --> 02:00:01,944
Many, in fact.

1582
02:00:05,574 --> 02:00:07,616
I owe quite a few myself.

1583
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:17,418
- Yeah, just along here, down these stairs.
- And will someone be escorting you?

1584
02:00:17,794 --> 02:00:19,003
My dad.

1585
02:00:20,547 --> 02:00:21,630
Dad.

1586
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:06,008
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks, Michael.

1587
02:01:19,522 --> 02:01:22,399
And now a very special moment.

1588
02:01:23,318 --> 02:01:24,693
Young lady.

1589
02:01:26,112 --> 02:01:29,573
Uh, this isn't in the program,
because it's a surprise.

1590
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:32,660
I surprise Rose a lot.

1591
02:01:34,037 --> 02:01:35,996
Usually she hates it.

1592
02:01:36,706 --> 02:01:40,084
I think... Well, I hope she likes this.

1593
02:01:44,965 --> 02:01:47,383
It's a poem by E.E. Cummings.

1594
02:01:49,844 --> 02:01:51,136
For you.

1595
02:01:58,937 --> 02:02:01,063
"I carry your heart with me.

1596
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:03,899
"I carry it in my heart.

1597
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:06,777
"I am never without it.

1598
02:02:06,861 --> 02:02:09,530
"Anywhere I go, you go, my dear.

1599
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:15,160
"And whatever is done by only me
is your doing, my darling.

1600
02:02:16,788 --> 02:02:18,414
"I fear no fate.

1601
02:02:18,957 --> 02:02:21,250
"For you are my fate, my sweet.

1602
02:02:22,711 --> 02:02:27,923
"I want no world, for, beautiful,
you are my world, my true.

1603
02:02:29,259 --> 02:02:32,094
"Here is the deepest secret no one knows.

1604
02:02:34,222 --> 02:02:37,933
"Here is the root of the root
and the bud of the bud.

1605
02:02:38,059 --> 02:02:41,186
"And the sky of the sky of a tree called life.

1606
02:02:41,813 --> 02:02:46,108
"Which grows higher than the soul can hope
or mind can hide.

1607
02:02:48,153 --> 02:02:51,363
"Is the wonder that's keeping
the stars apart.

1608
02:02:55,493 --> 02:02:57,286
"I carry your heart.

1609
02:02:59,622 --> 02:03:01,623
"I carry it in my heart."

1610
02:03:23,021 --> 02:03:24,980
I wanna love you

1611
02:03:26,441 --> 02:03:28,192
And treat you right

1612
02:03:28,818 --> 02:03:30,861
I wanna love you

1613
02:03:32,989 --> 02:03:35,741
Every day and every night

1614
02:03:35,825 --> 02:03:38,243
We'll be together

1615
02:03:40,663 --> 02:03:42,581
With a roof right over our heads

1616
02:03:42,665 --> 02:03:45,918
Oh, look at that. Now, you behave yourself.

1617
02:03:48,838 --> 02:03:51,090
...of my single bed

1618
02:03:51,674 --> 02:03:53,509
Oh, that's sweet.

1619
02:03:56,179 --> 02:03:59,306
'Cause Jah provide the bread

1620
02:03:59,682 --> 02:04:03,018
Is this love, is this love, is this love

1621
02:04:03,103 --> 02:04:05,854
Love that I'm feelin'?

1622
02:04:07,232 --> 02:04:09,525
Is this love, is this love...

1623
02:04:10,527 --> 02:04:12,528
You'll make sure Ella gets those?

1624
02:04:12,821 --> 02:04:14,321
Of course.

1625
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:16,990
Seriously, you can't keep them.

1626
02:04:17,075 --> 02:04:19,493
I wouldn't do that.

1627
02:04:27,794 --> 02:04:29,419
He's kind of hot.

1628
02:04:31,673 --> 02:04:33,048
Simon.

1629
02:04:38,054 --> 02:04:39,555
Not funny yet?

1630
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:44,726
Oh!

1631
02:04:58,241 --> 02:04:59,449
Bye.

1632
02:05:13,548 --> 02:05:16,633
Here is the deepest secret
no one knows.

1633
02:05:16,885 --> 02:05:20,262
Here is the root of the root
and the bud of the bud.

1634
02:05:20,972 --> 02:05:23,974
And the sky of the sky of a tree called life.

1635
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:28,103
Which grows higher than the soul can hope

1636
02:05:28,188 --> 02:05:29,813
or mind can hide.

1637
02:05:30,607 --> 02:05:33,609
Is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart.

1638
02:05:34,736 --> 02:05:36,445
I carry your heart.

1639
02:05:37,405 --> 02:05:39,281
I carry it in my heart.

1640
02:05:40,909 --> 02:05:45,412
I got you to wear my ring

1641
02:05:45,496 --> 02:05:50,751
And when I'm sad
You're a clown

1642
02:05:50,835 --> 02:05:55,964
And when I'm scared
You're always around

1643
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:59,259
So let them say our hair is long

1644
02:05:59,344 --> 02:06:03,847
I don't care
With you, I can't go wrong

1645
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:08,560
Babe
I got you, babe

1646
02:06:09,229 --> 02:06:11,188
I got you, babe

1647
02:06:11,648 --> 02:06:13,815
I got you, babe

1648
02:06:25,203 --> 02:06:28,956
Babe, I got you, babe

1649
02:06:29,874 --> 02:06:31,333
I got you

1650
02:06:32,877 --> 02:06:34,544
You, babe

1651
02:06:35,463 --> 02:06:37,965
I got you to hold my hand

1652
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:40,592
I got you to understand

1653
02:06:40,677 --> 02:06:43,136
I got you to walk with me

1654
02:06:43,221 --> 02:06:45,806
I got you to talk with me

1655
02:06:48,351 --> 02:06:50,018
You, babe

1656
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,312
I got you

1657
02:06:56,067 --> 02:06:57,359
Babe

1658
02:06:58,486 --> 02:07:00,279
You, babe

1659
02:07:00,822 --> 02:07:02,572
I got you

1660
02:07:03,908 --> 02:07:05,575
You, babe
