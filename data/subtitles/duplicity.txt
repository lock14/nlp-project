1
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:01,375
So how long
were you gonna keep me waiting?

2
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:02,783
Excuse me?

3
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,950
- I'm dying over there.
- Where?

4
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:08,965
There, by the Ben Franklin
potato salad pavilion.

5
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,731
I'm sorry.
Are we supposed to know each other?

6
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:15,710
Definitely. I mean, we're supposed to.
We don't, but we should.

7
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:21,216
- Ray. Ray Koval.
- Theresa Corrado.

8
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:23,225
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay.

9
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:25,822
- Happy Independence Day.
- And to you.

10
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:34,408
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know if it's the knee
or something, but I'm a little confused.

11
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:37,009
I thought we were checking each other out.

12
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:40,459
No. Sorry. Maybe you're drunk.

13
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:43,293
No, no, no.
If I was drunk, I'd be coming on to you.

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,424
That's a relief.

15
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,598
If I was drunk,
I'd be saying how amazing you look

16
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,236
and how crazy it is
that you're standing here on your own.

17
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:53,479
Wow. Are you always like this?

18
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:57,617
No. I sometimes sound like this,
but this is definitely different.

19
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:01,090
- What's so different?
- I don't know.

20
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:05,507
I guess that's what I came over to find out.

21
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:59,731
<i>RAY O VER PHONE: You're kidding, right?</i>
<i>DALE: I'm dead serious.</i>

22
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:03,170
<i>RAY: Behind me?</i>
<i>DALE: He made the turn with us on 6th.</i>

23
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,040
<i>RAY: Hey, if this is some kind of game</i>
<i>you guys play to keep things exciting,</i>

24
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:07,877
<i>I gotta tell you, it's a little sad.</i>

25
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:10,615
<i>DALE: This is no game, Ray.</i>
<i>This is real.</i>

26
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,954
<i>Like I told you, man,</i>
<i>this is old-school espionage.</i>

27
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,690
<i>Moscow rules. Street spies.</i>

28
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,564
<i>RAY: How far behind me?</i>

29
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:20,538
<i>DALE: He's about three meters back.</i>
<i>He must have picked us up downtown.</i>

30
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:22,076
<i>RAY: And you know this guy?</i>

31
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:25,548
<i>DALE: I've seen him around.</i>
<i>He's definitely Burkett & Randle.</i>

32
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:30,149
<i>I keep telling you, man. These people</i>
<i>take soap and shaving cream very seriously.</i>

33
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:32,822
So I guess that means we're going to plan B.

34
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:34,298
<i>DALE: Let's do it.</i>

35
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:37,601
- What's he wearing?
<i>- Navy turtleneck, gray jacket.</i>

36
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:48,159
That was sweet, man.
It's all good. It's all good.

37
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:50,663
There's no way this guy is working solo,
so if we want to bust you out,

38
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:54,137
we're gonna have to make a little noise
up here at the corner.

39
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:00,778
<i>DALE: You wanna box him out of here</i>
<i>or leapfrog? What do you wanna do?</i>

40
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,846
I still think you're messing with me.

41
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,189
Call it, Ray. Box or leapfrog?

42
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:08,690
Or maybe you just want to find out
if I'm worth the money.

43
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:11,797
<i>- DALE: Come on, man.</i>
- Leapfrog.

44
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:18,512
Jesus!

45
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:23,189
Watch where you go. It's New York, okay?

46
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:24,788
Let me help.

47
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,360
Open the eyes!

48
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:55,198
- Hey, you there?
<i>- DALE: What are you doing?</i>

49
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,735
Problem.

50
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:02,580
<i>- DALE: I thought you were in position.</i>
- I am. I was.

51
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:04,182
<i>DALE: We're two minutes away.</i>

52
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,754
- We're blown.
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

53
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:07,993
Reschedule the meet.

54
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:10,061
No. No can do.

55
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,402
We're blown. Just walk away.

56
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:15,913
Listen to me. I know what it's like.
New guy on the team, big game,

57
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:18,384
<i>you wanna make a good impression.</i>

58
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,557
Hello? Ray?

59
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:37,907
Remember me?

60
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:44,415
- Sure. Of course. We...
- Long time, huh?

61
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:47,690
- Yes!
- Gotcha.

62
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,293
- I'm sorry, I just...
- Just what?

63
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:53,429
I'm drawing a blank.

64
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:55,202
- Nice try.
- Excuse me?

65
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:58,215
A little professional courtesy
would make this a lot less awkward.

66
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,947
- How do I know you?
- How do you know me?

67
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:05,590
Wow! That's tough.
That's a strong play.

68
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,566
Believe me, I've spent a lot of time thinking
what this would be like,

69
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,972
where we'd be, what I'd say, what you'd say.

70
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:14,240
- But I never thought that you'd...
- I'm terribly sorry.

71
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:15,782
You really want to go this way?

72
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,479
You clearly have me confused
with someone else.

73
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:18,679
I don't know.

74
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:21,317
I mean, I'm not great on names.
I should be. I try.

75
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:24,193
Faces, I'm definitely better.
Faces, I'm like a B, B minus.

76
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,466
Where I'm good, where I really excel,
people I've slept with.

77
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:30,203
That's been a traditional area of strength
for me.

78
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:33,341
Look, seriously,
I don't know who you think I am, but...

79
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:35,010
You charm me, you seduce me,
you screw me,

80
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:37,557
then you drug me
and ransack my hotel room.

81
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,894
And how sick is this? You know, the last
thing I remember before I passed out

82
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,969
was how much I liked you.

83
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:46,466
All right. You don't look crazy,

84
00:11:46,543 --> 00:11:48,307
which is the only reason
why I'm not screaming

85
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,684
- for a security guard right now, but...
- I can't believe you're going this way.

86
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:56,695
Wait. Is this a joke?
Is that what it is?

87
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:59,595
Do you have any idea how far my ass
was hanging out because of you?

88
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,433
Did I win something?

89
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:05,105
I woke up the next morning,
I went back to the consul.

90
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:07,878
I practically crawled over glass
to get a copy of the guest list.

91
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:09,716
I spent the next 24 hours trying to figure out

92
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:13,659
if you were working for Mossad,
the Syrians or the Russians.

93
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,725
- And which was it?
- Still working for the CIA?

94
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,734
Okay, I think we're done now.

95
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:24,013
American Consulate, Dubai,
you and me, Fourth of July, 2003.

96
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:25,210
Find someone else to bother.

97
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,448
- Red, white and blue margaritas.
- Stay away from me.

98
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:30,859
I had a knee brace, you had toe rings.
First toe ring I ever saw, by the way.

99
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:32,192
You follow me, I'll scream.

100
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:35,260
I took vacation time to find you! Five years.

101
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:36,738
And every time I walked into an evaluation...

102
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:38,710
- I'm warning you for the last time.
...I was waiting for them

103
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:39,975
to throw your picture on the screen and say,

104
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:42,109
"So, Ray, anything you care to tell us
about Dubai?"

105
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,282
- You are harassing me!
- So who the hell are you?

106
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:51,326
Oh, no. You?

107
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:59,140
- You're the drop.
- You're my contact?

108
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,990
You're acting like
I owe you an apology.

109
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:07,533
Knock yourself out.

110
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:10,298
You were an assignment. You're a big boy.
You knew what you were doing.

111
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,932
I can see it's really been eating at you.

112
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,972
An Ml6 case officer takes a strange girl
from an embassy party

113
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:18,818
back to his hotel room
where he has an unsecured briefcase

114
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,384
- full of Egyptian Air Defense codes.
- Did they tell you to sleep with me?

115
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:24,227
I needed the codes. I thought the less time
I spent with you, the better.

116
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:27,134
- Oh, Jesus.
- How did you get on this project?

117
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,541
- And you're the mole.
- And who the hell hired you anyway?

118
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:31,409
- I can't believe it.
- How did you get this job?

119
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:33,346
I got news for you, okay? The day I left Ml6,

120
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:36,014
I had 15 major companies
begging for my services.

121
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:38,390
Well, I guess you picked wrong.
But you must be used to that.

122
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:41,934
- You know, I've got a meeting in 12 minutes.
- Where's the drop? Hand it over.

123
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:45,337
- Forget it. I'm not working with you.
- Excuse me?

124
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,072
You think I'm gonna let you
be my contact officer?

125
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:50,616
- This is way over your head.
- Over my head?

126
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,019
Lady, I worked Yemen, Athens and Cairo.

127
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,457
I've been promoted and decorated
every place I served.

128
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:57,029
Tell Duke to send someone else.

129
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:59,466
Listen. I'm sure you know your way
around a shoe store,

130
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:01,129
but I did 12 years in the field.

131
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,971
And how long have you been working
for Equikrom?

132
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,942
- Long enough.
- How long?

133
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,051
Three weeks.

134
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,083
Three whole weeks? Like every day?

135
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:17,394
Well, I've spent the last 14 months
undercover inside Burkett & Randle.

136
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:21,308
I'm an Assistant Director
of Counterintelligence. I am all the way in.

137
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:25,078
So let's get this straight.
I'm the asset here. You're a delivery boy.

138
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:27,145
And the only thing I'm gonna give you
is a message.

139
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:30,251
Tell Duke I don't ever wanna see you again.

140
00:14:30,998 --> 00:14:34,437
I run field agents for a living.
There's only two ways to do it.

141
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:35,529
Either you bring them flowers

142
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,701
or you hang them by their heels
out of the window.

143
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:41,113
Now, maybe you're so used to having
your legs in the air you don't realize it,

144
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:43,779
but you're upside down, sister.

145
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:45,120
I own you.

146
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:50,293
- You've 10 seconds to get your hand off me.
- Or what? You won't be my friend anymore?

147
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:54,334
I like this gig.
I like the money. I like the hours.

148
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:56,711
So I'm not going anywhere,
and you're gonna get over it

149
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:59,513
because if you ever mention again
that you don't wanna work with me

150
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:03,150
or that we've met before or that you think
someone else might do a better job,

151
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:05,924
if I get replaced for any reason at all,

152
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,264
I'm gonna call those suckers
over at Burkett & Randle

153
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,937
and tell them they have an Equikrom spy
in the heart of their security team.

154
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,618
Be a shame to let the last 14 months
go down the drain, wouldn't it?

155
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,067
So where's my package?

156
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:33,548
Tell Duke this is the one
he's been waiting for.

157
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,152
- You screw this up, I'll ruin your life.
- I thought you tried that already.

158
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:46,168
You wanna take one last shot
at that apology?

159
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:13,386
Okay. Thank you.

160
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:36,900
What'd she say exactly?
I mean, her exact words.

161
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:41,014
She said, " Tell Duke
this is the one he's been waiting for."

162
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,894
Do you wanna do it?
- Go ahead.

163
00:16:50,102 --> 00:16:53,075
Easy. Just...
Just, you know, pull it out.

164
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:55,037
- Slowly. Slowly, slowly.
- Duke.

165
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:56,876
All right, go ahead.

166
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,587
Pam, Pam, easy, don't tear it.
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, just... Careful.

167
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,259
- For Christ's sake, Duke, keep your shirt on.
- Just...

168
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:10,603
Do something useful.
Punch up Tully's fingerprints.

169
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:13,605
Wow. Look at this.

170
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,450
So is this the big one?

171
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:22,259
- I gotta call Garsik right away.
Yeah.

172
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,969
Come on.
I need a secure line at Equikrom.

173
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:48,311
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

174
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,212
<i>CLAIRE: Houston.</i>
<i>This was over the weekend.</i>

175
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:06,374
<i>NED: Who are they?</i>

176
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:11,221
Researchers at the fragrance lab down there,
when they're not dealing ecstasy.

177
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:13,057
Track it.

178
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,869
West Coast Market Coordinator
of the Floor Wax Division.

179
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:22,507
Came back from lunch on Friday,
handed in his resignation.

180
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,381
- Unexpected?
- Very.

181
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:27,016
Three kids in private school,
he just remortgaged his house,

182
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,060
- and the wife has a heart condition.
- All right.

183
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:33,432
Well, get his financials, phone, e-mail,
and get the wife's prognosis.

184
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:38,039
Senior V.P., Medical Disposables.
He called in Sunday,

185
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:40,742
lost his laptop in the Denver Airport.

186
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:42,309
Why does this guy look familiar?

187
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:46,259
He had a briefcase
full of sales projections stolen last year.

188
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:49,759
- Is this the guy who bought the boat?
- Same guy.

189
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:54,073
- All right. Get a team up his ass tonight.
- I sent them this morning.

190
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:57,978
We're in a meeting.

191
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,817
Now? Everyone?

192
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:05,932
Well, did they say why?

193
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:13,010
It's Tully. Mr. Tully's coming down.

194
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:16,348
He wants the entire floor gathered
in five minutes.

195
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:54,217
<i>AIDE: Dick, it's just that you have</i>
<i>a very busy schedule today.</i>

196
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,593
Yeah, well, something's come up.

197
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:58,863
There's the dandruff shampoo
marketing presentation at 3:00.

198
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:01,374
- Cancel.
- They're in the building.

199
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:02,467
Make it tomorrow.

200
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:05,880
The nail polish R&D group from Germany
is at 3:45.

201
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:07,044
Reschedule.

202
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,056
You've got a premium diaper teleconference

203
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,718
- at 4:15.
- Tape it.

204
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,287
The nasal decongestant
rebranding numbers are in.

205
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:15,596
- They wanted 15 minutes at around...
- Cancel!

206
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:19,508
And the toothpaste. And the car wax dinner.
Cancel it all.

207
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:27,448
All right, let's have a look at me.

208
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:34,105
There should be another vehicle.

209
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:36,108
Yeah. Change of plans.
You're going with them.

210
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:40,378
Everybody's going. Let's go, come on.
Get out there and sell it, folks!

211
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:43,480
Go, go, go! Come on!
Get the hell out of here!

212
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:54,171
Get out! Leave it running.
Leave it running. I'm driving.

213
00:21:06,568 --> 00:21:07,866
This is starting to look pretty good.

214
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:10,339
I can't even tell them apart.
Which one is the new one?

215
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,741
Right here.

216
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,743
- This is 16.
- That's a match.

217
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:19,287
Boris, handwriting?

218
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:23,633
Hundred percent. It's Howard Tully.

219
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:26,708
All right.
Burkett & Randle, here we come!

220
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:27,867
Guys?

221
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:33,882
Duke? I'm locked out. Again.

222
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:38,028
Yeah, I'm standing right outside.

223
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,431
Of course it's me!
Who the hell else has this number?

224
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:45,942
Yeah, okay. Duke, you know,
for all the money that I'm spending on this,

225
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:48,778
you could've given me a code
that I can remember.

226
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:49,910
Sir!

227
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:01,772
What the hell is this?

228
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:11,519
<i>Why are we here?</i>

229
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:16,298
<i>We are here today</i>
<i>because the rules have changed.</i>

230
00:22:17,173 --> 00:22:22,480
<i>We're here because the fabric of integrity</i>
<i>has been so abused and mangled</i>

231
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,646
<i>that it is little more</i>
<i>than a threadbare memory.</i>

232
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:30,862
<i>We're here because it's no longer enough</i>
<i>to have the best ideas,</i>

233
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:35,840
or the best manufacturing,
or the best pipeline to deliver your product.

234
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:41,419
"We're here today because we find ourselves
in a world where duplicity and theft

235
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,190
"are tested daily as replacements
for innovation and perseverance."

236
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,434
"Tested daily." What a bunch of crap.
Can you believe this?

237
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,948
This from a guy who bought a dump
so he could go through our garbage.

238
00:22:56,048 --> 00:22:58,416
<i>I believe the history</i>
<i>of all successful endeavors</i>

239
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:03,053
<i>can be reduced to a series</i>
<i>of decisive moments.</i>

240
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:05,733
"There are moments in the history
of all things

241
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,295
"where the placement of a single..."

242
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:11,742
<i>... where the placement of a single molecule</i>
<i>can make the difference</i>

243
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:14,306
<i>between triumph and catastrophe.</i>

244
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:16,787
I mean, who the hell writes
with a fountain pen anymore?

245
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,726
For Christ's sake.
How fricking pretentious is that?

246
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:22,493
<i>This room we're in now,</i>
<i>this entire program,</i>

247
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,439
<i>was created in anticipation</i>
<i>of just such a moment.</i>

248
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:29,845
<i>You people are the very best at what you do.</i>

249
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:36,288
<i>You were chosen by that standard.</i>
<i>You've been paid and treated accordingly.</i>

250
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:42,836
<i>And you have never been tested</i>
<i>as you are about to be tested.</i>

251
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:47,210
"Burkett & Randle will be rolling out
a new product

252
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:52,223
"in the very near future."

253
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:55,854
<i>And while I cannot reveal</i>
<i>the nature of this product,</i>

254
00:23:55,932 --> 00:24:00,270
<i>believe me when I tell you that simply</i>
<i>by announcing its development...</i>

255
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:06,579
"...B&R will be dramatically repositioned
at the summit of the global marketplace."

256
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:09,958
<i>I don't need to explain to anybody</i>
<i>in this room</i>

257
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,625
<i>why the scope, the details,</i>
<i>the very existence of this project</i>

258
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:16,034
<i>must be so carefully protected.</i>

259
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:19,477
<i>I expect your best in days to come,</i>

260
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,443
<i>and I promise you,</i>
<i>if we stay focused and vigilant,</i>

261
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:26,819
<i>we will, all of us...</i>

262
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:29,564
"...prosper."

263
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,572
What the hell does he have over there?

264
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:39,481
Dick? Dick? Don't go dark on me now.

265
00:24:40,921 --> 00:24:41,980
Dick!

266
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,364
We gotta stay positive. Hey, look around.

267
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:49,127
This is why we're here.

268
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:52,836
When you came to me,
that first conversation, this is it.

269
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:55,346
This is why we built the unit.

270
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:58,615
- I know what he's doing.
- Dick. Dick!

271
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,791
Look at me.
This is a great team we've got here.

272
00:25:01,861 --> 00:25:02,953
Mmm-hmm.

273
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:06,058
Yeah. We are so prepped.
We are so ready to deploy.

274
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,232
You say the word,
you unleash the beast, Dick.

275
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:12,747
- We will tear this thing apart.
- He's just timing the blow, Duke.

276
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:17,814
- No. Wrong. We caught a break here.
- We caught a break? You call this a break?

277
00:25:18,728 --> 00:25:21,665
I got a shareholders<i>'</i> convention
in nine days.

278
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:22,929
Hey, man, he's not thinking about that.

279
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:24,334
Oh!

280
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:28,538
Are you out of your fricking mind?
That is all that he thinks about.

281
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:33,112
And believe you me, if he has got a knife,
that is when he's gonna use it,

282
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:36,125
because that's what I'd do! Yeah.

283
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:40,259
No, I would wait till he is right in the middle
of a big old standing ovation.

284
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:45,367
I would wait till he is just so overwhelmed
with beloved waves of adoration,

285
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:47,973
he couldn't even hear the sound
of his own <i>cojones</i>

286
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:50,281
as they hit the goddamn floor!

287
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:02,635
Oh, my God, he is gonna crush me.

288
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:06,946
Tell your people not to make vacation plans.

289
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:09,253
- They're gonna wanna know why.
- Then they're in the wrong business.

290
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,796
How are we supposed to work it up
if we don't know what we're protecting?

291
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:14,801
Look, I don't know. Assume it's everything.

292
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:20,808
B&R's mainframe network is a beast.

293
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:24,376
I mean, we've spent
the last 10 months probing.

294
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,684
We got nowhere.

295
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:27,728
I mean, the encryption
and system awareness codes

296
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:31,632
are tactically equivalent
to anything we had at the Pentagon.

297
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:37,907
The good news is 200 photocopiers
that B&R purchased last month.

298
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,048
We paid a little visit down to the vendor,

299
00:26:40,153 --> 00:26:44,252
and we made a few adjustments
to one of the units before it shipped.

300
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,328
Call this the Ghost.

301
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,337
It's not fast, it's not easy,
but this device right here

302
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:52,398
allows us to hijack signal traffic

303
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:55,505
without leaving
any electronic residue behind.

304
00:26:55,883 --> 00:27:01,919
Here. Right now we're hacking a photocopier
in their Human Resources Department.

305
00:27:02,363 --> 00:27:06,894
I mean, we're still mapping, but look,
we're tapped into 12 units already.

306
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:09,766
The B&R Research
and Development Unit in Westchester

307
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:13,407
hasn't brought a major new product
to market since 1997.

308
00:27:13,952 --> 00:27:16,980
In spite of that,
we made it a surveillance priority.

309
00:27:17,092 --> 00:27:19,324
Number one, we graph the volume of traffic

310
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,832
and the quality of vehicles
in that parking lot.

311
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,962
Number two, we track the stock portfolios
and mortgage payments

312
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:26,303
of everybody on site.

313
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:29,346
And, number three, we monitor
the frequency of Internet shopping

314
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:31,419
and pornography searches
from inside that lab.

315
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:35,927
Stocks are down, porn is up
and there's plenty of free parking.

316
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:38,022
There's nothing going on here.

317
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:40,694
We're confident
that whatever this new product is,

318
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:42,636
it comes from outside the company.

319
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,107
The moment this meeting breaks up,

320
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:47,980
we'll be going over every acquisition
B&R has made in the past 18 months.

321
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:49,519
We'll find it.

322
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:52,991
This B&R building is very strong
with security.

323
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:56,561
Is the same for us like the computer.

324
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:58,901
We are all the time feeling our way
around this building,

325
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:00,999
but not getting anywhere.

326
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:05,550
Then we make a big discovery.
Travel Department is not in the big building.

327
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:11,096
Travel Department is four blocks away
and this building is very different.

328
00:28:11,664 --> 00:28:15,694
- Very simple and very basic.
- Yeah, it's a gold mine, Dick.

329
00:28:15,771 --> 00:28:17,765
They basically handle
all of B&R's commercial travel,

330
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:22,840
so every private jet, car, boat, hotel,
housing, everything goes through them.

331
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,951
The boys have got some great ideas
on how to get us on the inside.

332
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,226
Very simple and very basic.

333
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,757
I swear, she was that big.

334
00:29:35,863 --> 00:29:37,422
No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

335
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:40,693
Don't start that again. Translate that?

336
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:44,006
- You're always kidding.
- I'm not. I'm a very serious guy.

337
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:47,578
I'll be right back.

338
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,597
Hi. Remember me?

339
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,400
- Yes, I...
- Gotcha.

340
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:46,346
- I'm sorry, I just...
- Just what?

341
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:49,144
- I'm drawing a blank.
- Don't even try it.

342
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:50,848
- Excuse me?
- Can I make a suggestion?

343
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:53,589
A little professional courtesy
would make this a lot less awkward.

344
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:57,193
- How do I know you?
- How do you know me?

345
00:31:57,304 --> 00:31:59,798
Wow. That's a strong play.

346
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,869
Believe me, I've spent a lot of time
thinking what this would be like,

347
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,508
where we'd be, what I'd say, what you'd say,

348
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:06,179
- but I never thought that you'd...
- I'm sorry. I just...

349
00:32:06,288 --> 00:32:07,347
You really wanna go this way?

350
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,394
Look, you clearly have me confused
with someone else.

351
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,464
I don't know, I'm not great on names.
I should be. I try.

352
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:13,798
Faces, I'm definitely better.
Faces I'm like a B, B minus.

353
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:16,636
Where I'm good, where I really excel,
people I've slept with.

354
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:18,473
That's been a traditional
area of strength for me.

355
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:20,516
Look, I don't know who you think I am, but...

356
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:23,349
You talk me up, seduce me, screw me,

357
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:26,589
then you drug me and ransack
my hotel room.

358
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,857
And how sick is this? The last thing
I remember before I passed out

359
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:30,027
was how much I liked you.

360
00:32:30,103 --> 00:32:31,934
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't...

361
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:34,202
- What? You think this is funny?
- I... No, I...

362
00:32:34,277 --> 00:32:36,906
No, it's not. I'm sorry. It's just...

363
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:39,247
It's... Seduce you? You?

364
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:41,084
- You admit it?
- I...

365
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:45,291
- I just... No, I'm... No, I'm...
- No, you don't get to do this.

366
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,095
- You do not get to laugh about this.
- It's...

367
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:49,536
- This is unacceptable.
- No, you're right. You're right.

368
00:32:49,606 --> 00:32:52,772
It's not funny. Seriously. Completely.

369
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,942
- And it's not you. It's not you.
- What the hell does that mean?

370
00:32:56,051 --> 00:33:00,550
It's tension. Nerves.
Nervous laughter, obviously.

371
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:04,261
Your knee. Wow. All better, huh?

372
00:33:04,903 --> 00:33:09,071
Yeah, with that brace and everything,
you really looked like you were hurting.

373
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:10,238
My knee is fine. Thanks.

374
00:33:10,314 --> 00:33:12,477
Do you have any idea how far my ass
was hanging out because of you?

375
00:33:12,585 --> 00:33:15,785
- Mmm. I can imagine.
- That's all you say?

376
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:18,020
And I'm sorry.

377
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:19,153
I can tell.

378
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:24,104
It's... I don't know. The laughter.
I don't know what that's about. It's about...

379
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:28,546
Nerves. Guilt. Lots of guilt. And regret.

380
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:33,616
Remorse. Just a lot of things.

381
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,961
I mean, I'm assuming you know
by now that I was

382
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:41,132
working for the Agency,
so, yeah, there's that.

383
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:43,301
- This sucks.
- Yeah.

384
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:44,846
I mean, we were under a lot of pressure then.

385
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:47,181
This is totally unsatisfying.

386
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:51,992
Well, what did you have in mind?

387
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:55,898
I mean, in terms of vengeance.

388
00:35:00,128 --> 00:35:01,460
Hey.

389
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:19,353
What's that?

390
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,365
The reckoning.

391
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:26,407
Bad?

392
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:30,409
We've been bad.

393
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:32,012
How bad?

394
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:34,590
We've been very bad.

395
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:37,099
We're very good at it.

396
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,275
Worth it?

397
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,393
Very.

398
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,335
Very worth it.

399
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,541
Oh, my God.
What?

400
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:20,945
It's...

401
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,858
It's noon. It's 12:15.
What happened to my wake-up call?

402
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:27,396
I left a wake-up call.

403
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:31,871
Oh, Jesus! This can't be happening.
This is not the day to not get a wake-up call.

404
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:34,878
Oh, God!
I can't believe I didn't get my wake-up call.

405
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,177
I had a 10:30 flight.

406
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:40,188
I'm supposed to be landing
in Geneva right now.

407
00:36:40,257 --> 00:36:42,659
You probably told me all this.
I just don't remember it.

408
00:36:42,728 --> 00:36:45,757
No. I couldn't. It's classified.

409
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:49,398
Yeah, I was supposed to be in Cairo
two days ago.

410
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:52,445
- You told me London.
- The point is, I blew it off.

411
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:54,380
And nobody called this morning?

412
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:57,047
- You were here.
- I'm a heavy sleeper.

413
00:36:57,123 --> 00:36:59,786
So what are you saying?
I took the call and didn't tell you?

414
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:01,760
When did you set this up, anyway?

415
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:03,425
Last night.
Where was I?

416
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:05,059
In the bath.

417
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:08,373
- We were in there together.
- When I went for the ice.

418
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:09,777
While I was waiting?

419
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,543
I can't believe they didn't call.

420
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:14,110
You snuck out of the tub
to leave a wake-up call!

421
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:17,286
This is a five-star hotel.
How does that happen?

422
00:37:18,898 --> 00:37:20,731
Welcome to Italy.

423
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:27,646
Look, I told you it was classified.
I shouldn't have to explain this to you.

424
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:30,585
Well, this beats the hell out of Dubai.

425
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:33,090
- What?
- I'm still standing, right?

426
00:37:34,262 --> 00:37:36,527
There. See? There it is.

427
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:38,295
If you're looking
for Egyptian Air Defense codes,

428
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:40,704
- I'm keeping them in my socks these days.
- See, I knew it.

429
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:42,641
You'll never get over that, will you?
You couldn't.

430
00:37:42,711 --> 00:37:44,510
I'm afraid that's classified.

431
00:37:44,614 --> 00:37:47,518
- You actually think, what, I'm playing you?
- That's crazy, right?

432
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:50,056
This felt like an assignment to you?
Three days? All this?

433
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:52,322
What was the objective? Rug burn?

434
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,858
Who knows, maybe you didn't want me
in Cairo yesterday.

435
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:59,135
God, that's so sad.

436
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:03,079
Because that's exactly
what I was just thinking.

437
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:05,586
That maybe you're playing me,
that you canceled my call.

438
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,425
That this was just some revenge
to get back at me for Dubai.

439
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:14,034
Then I'm thinking how terrible it is
that I think that way.

440
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:16,873
Then I realize we both think that way.

441
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:21,079
Then I'm thinking,

442
00:38:22,188 --> 00:38:24,715
is that what makes this so worth it?

443
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:27,588
Is that it?

444
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,940
That I know you're thinking
exactly what I'm thinking?

445
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:37,985
Because then I'm thinking, do we both
think like that because of what we do?

446
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:41,114
Are we good at what we do
because we think like that?

447
00:38:41,226 --> 00:38:43,559
Everybody thinks like that.
They just don't say it.

448
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,659
- Civilians don't think like that.
- Bullshit.

449
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:51,507
- Nobody trusts anybody. We just cop to it.
- Okay. So cop to it.

450
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:54,585
- Me? I think you better go first.
- Why? What am I hiding?

451
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:56,985
This wasn't an accident, was it?

452
00:38:57,592 --> 00:39:00,188
Being here. Meeting like this.

453
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,030
You came looking for me, didn't you?

454
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:07,438
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- I'm right, though, aren't I?

455
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,706
Because you went looking for me, right?

456
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,978
But why? Just for this?

457
00:39:12,052 --> 00:39:14,387
- Isn't that enough?
- Not for you.

458
00:39:15,726 --> 00:39:17,788
What are we into, Claire?

459
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:22,672
Can you imagine living like this?

460
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,007
- How much fun we could have?
- Aren't we in enough trouble?

461
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,409
I mean, having the money.

462
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:33,550
- Keep going.
- How much do you think we'd need?

463
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:38,702
- $20 million?
- I was thinking 40.

464
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:44,907
So what do you have to do
to get $40 million?

465
00:39:46,286 --> 00:39:48,414
Go private.

466
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:50,289
Be smart.

467
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:52,193
Get lucky.

468
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,699
How smart?

469
00:39:54,735 --> 00:39:57,434
Smart enough to pick the right partner.

470
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,909
- Private, you mean...
- Corporate.

471
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,313
And lucky?

472
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:06,655
Be someplace when something's happening.

473
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:09,059
Be there first, hear it first.

474
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,601
- Something inside.
- Something big.

475
00:40:11,668 --> 00:40:15,164
- But do it up right.
- Set it deep. Take your time.

476
00:40:15,275 --> 00:40:17,802
Know your way out before you go in.

477
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:23,981
- You know what I think?
- I think you like the idea.

478
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:27,931
- I think you missed me.
- I think you canceled my call.

479
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,637
So, we're even.

480
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:44,793
Yeah, copy that.

481
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:46,836
Okay, so you hold tight.

482
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:49,807
No, we're just around the corner from you.

483
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:51,675
I'll be standing by.

484
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:54,375
He's moving?
- Yep.

485
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,217
So very simple, very basic, right?

486
00:40:57,324 --> 00:40:59,487
The plan is good. It's up to him.

487
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:01,692
He's got a great reputation.

488
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:06,739
Look, Garsik says the sky is falling
in six days.

489
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:09,440
If you got a better idea, tell me now.

490
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:12,018
Right. So get to work.

491
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,311
- Oh, my gosh.
- Excuse me.

492
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:33,655
Look at this. I am so sorry.

493
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:39,635
Here I am, squeezing around,
making a complete pig of myself.

494
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:42,605
Look at this. Are you...

495
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:45,014
I'm fine. Really. It's nothing.

496
00:41:45,518 --> 00:41:47,715
What was it before I got here?

497
00:41:48,456 --> 00:41:50,016
Appletini.

498
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:52,690
Well, that sounds good. Was it good?

499
00:41:53,134 --> 00:41:56,070
Yes, they're very good. They're great.

500
00:41:56,172 --> 00:41:58,507
We'll have two of those, please.

501
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,748
You coming or going?

502
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:08,192
Well, I woke up in Knoxville,
I'm supposed to be sleeping in Belgium,

503
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:11,063
and here I am in New York
waiting for an Appleteen.

504
00:42:11,168 --> 00:42:13,400
So, I guess I'm just not sure.

505
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:20,710
- My daddy was from Tennessee.
- You're kidding. Where?

506
00:42:20,786 --> 00:42:23,588
- Western part of the state.
- Where?

507
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:28,391
Just a little town.
It was actually named after our family.

508
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:29,802
You're not gonna make me guess, are you?

509
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:32,969
Bofferd.

510
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:34,802
- Get out of here!
- What?

511
00:42:34,914 --> 00:42:37,317
- Is this some kind of joke?
- No. Not at all.

512
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,326
I used to go fishing in Bofferd.
I grew up in Darnum, next county over.

513
00:42:41,427 --> 00:42:45,994
Well, that's my name! Bofferd.
Barbara Bofferd. Here, look.

514
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:48,338
Have a look.

515
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:52,311
Damn.

516
00:42:52,782 --> 00:42:56,085
Well, it's nice to meet you, Barbara.
I'm Jimmy Tierney.

517
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:59,652
- You don't seem like a Jimmy.
- Well, actually it's James.

518
00:42:59,762 --> 00:43:03,202
Well, actually, it's Dr. Tierney.
Would you excuse me?

519
00:43:04,172 --> 00:43:06,164
Yeah, did you get them?

520
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:10,514
Nobody there can help me out?

521
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:14,021
What, and wait at the airport all night?

522
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,353
That's $26.

523
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:19,902
No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not your fault.
Okay, yeah. Thanks.

524
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:26,748
Travel problem?

525
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:28,045
Yep.

526
00:43:28,887 --> 00:43:31,016
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.

527
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:35,690
We're opening a clinic in Ethiopia,
and my team's over there waiting for me.

528
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:39,003
I was supposed to fly to Brussels tonight
and then on to Nairobi

529
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,512
but my ticket got scrambled.
So, I got on a flight in the morning,

530
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,675
but now they're telling me
it's too late to get ticketed now,

531
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:46,947
so I'm gonna have to spend the night
at the airport

532
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:49,583
just to make sure I can get on the plane.

533
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:53,291
Now, all you need is a flight to Brussels
in the morning?

534
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:56,766
Honey, that's what I do for a living.

535
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,929
We have to be quiet, okay?

536
00:44:14,242 --> 00:44:16,735
No peeking! You're peeking.

537
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:29,329
I can't believe I'm doing this.

538
00:44:54,186 --> 00:44:55,985
Back up.
I want to see that one more time.

539
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:57,753
Let's get it all in here.

540
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,556
Passport or permit?
Right there! What does it say?

541
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:00,893
Wait? Over here, or here?
Read this one.

542
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,023
What's that say?

543
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:03,228
I mean, why aren't we on three terminals?

544
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:05,900
- I don't understand why we only have two.
How many eyes do you have?

545
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:07,603
For Christ's sake, Duke!

546
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:13,418
- You're getting that to go, right?
- Why?

547
00:45:13,523 --> 00:45:17,224
- Didn't you get the text?
- I don't know. I just stepped out.

548
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,702
- Did you read my memo last month?
- Which one?

549
00:45:21,106 --> 00:45:23,871
Vulnerabilities at the travel office.

550
00:45:24,278 --> 00:45:25,974
I don't remember.

551
00:45:26,382 --> 00:45:28,079
See you upstairs.

552
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:33,492
Okay, so what are we looking at here?
Give me a ballpark figure.

553
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,623
- Around 10, 12 minutes.
- And then what, I get everything?

554
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:37,567
Six years of travel orders.

555
00:45:37,637 --> 00:45:39,335
- Eight minutes. Eight minutes.
- Great.

556
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,806
All right.

557
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,621
Super job, Ray.

558
00:45:50,195 --> 00:45:52,097
Really. Outstanding.

559
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:05,023
- Who is this guy?
We're not sure.

560
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:09,297
Jesus.

561
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,335
Is that the one
where they're on the desk?

562
00:46:11,403 --> 00:46:12,565
Is he an Equikrom agent?

563
00:46:12,672 --> 00:46:15,199
Yeah, if he is, he's new.
We don't have him logged.

564
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:17,543
We think they're running
some fresh players out there.

565
00:46:17,648 --> 00:46:20,677
Wow. Get this woman over here.

566
00:46:20,755 --> 00:46:24,387
I was thinking I should conduct
the interview at the travel office.

567
00:46:24,496 --> 00:46:25,724
Rattle their cages. See if anybody...

568
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:29,532
No, I want her over here.
And don't tell her a damn thing.

569
00:46:30,742 --> 00:46:34,442
- I was just thinking...
- And Claire's doing the interview.

570
00:46:34,548 --> 00:46:36,711
- But, Ned, I wrote the memo.
- No.

571
00:46:36,786 --> 00:46:39,121
I want her to talk to a woman.

572
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:52,576
Okay, assumption A,
Burkett & Randle has a new product.

573
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,813
Assumption B,
they didn't develop it internally.

574
00:46:54,922 --> 00:46:56,048
I agree.

575
00:46:56,123 --> 00:46:59,757
So, we took every company
B&R bought in the last 18 months.

576
00:46:59,831 --> 00:47:01,561
They made 57 acquisitions.

577
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:04,731
We tossed out anything where the product
was known or already on the market.

578
00:47:04,807 --> 00:47:07,836
- We ended up with...
- Twenty-eight, the 28 companies.

579
00:47:07,947 --> 00:47:10,110
We can't dig deep on any of them.
We don't have time.

580
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:12,280
So we're scanning for patterns.

581
00:47:12,356 --> 00:47:16,090
Last night, Dale ran a timeline,
and we found a day last March

582
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:19,032
when B&R bought seven companies
in one afternoon.

583
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:20,536
- Is that normal?
- No.

584
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,108
So they're hiding something.

585
00:47:23,811 --> 00:47:27,273
- What are they hiding?
- I think it's Dunwoody, Georgia.

586
00:47:27,351 --> 00:47:30,949
We just laid the travel office records
over our calendar.

587
00:47:31,025 --> 00:47:33,326
You can't believe
the amount of traffic last summer

588
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:35,958
between New York City
and Dunwoody, Georgia.

589
00:47:36,034 --> 00:47:39,201
Howard Tully made
at least six separate visits,

590
00:47:39,307 --> 00:47:41,972
none of which were reported
in his official schedule.

591
00:47:42,047 --> 00:47:45,041
So what the hell's down there?

592
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,061
Something called Formavale Labs.

593
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:53,657
I think we need to get the boys down there
right away.

594
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:00,342
Where's he going?

595
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:26,795
It was the way, when he talked
about the children, you know.

596
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:30,965
Helping the little children
and mending their broken hearts.

597
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:35,847
And I know, I do,
how I should know better, and I'm not...

598
00:48:35,952 --> 00:48:37,682
I'm really not a gullible person.

599
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,956
But... But the children
and their little hearts...

600
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:53,684
And... And, yes, I felt special, you know,
that I could help him and the children.

601
00:48:53,786 --> 00:48:57,693
And, yes, he was cute, I'll admit it.

602
00:48:57,795 --> 00:49:01,632
Everything falling out of his pockets,
and charming.

603
00:49:03,304 --> 00:49:04,831
You know, I mean special.

604
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:08,507
Special, like there was no one
in the world but me.

605
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:11,418
Hasn't anyone ever made you feel special?

606
00:49:15,596 --> 00:49:18,362
Maybe for you it happens all the time.

607
00:49:18,436 --> 00:49:21,840
Yeah, you probably have someone
making you feel that way all the time.

608
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:23,501
You know what? I don't even care.

609
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:27,018
Do whatever you're gonna do.
'Cause you know what?

610
00:49:27,085 --> 00:49:28,610
I loved it!

611
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:30,885
It was worth it.

612
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,952
It was so very worth it.

613
00:49:33,697 --> 00:49:36,693
It was incredibly worth it.

614
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:29,065
- Hello?
Hey, it's me.

615
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:35,242
- You're so early. I just got in.
- I ran.

616
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:44,833
- It went okay?
- Not a hitch. God, you feel good.

617
00:50:54,422 --> 00:50:55,684
I can't believe you got here so fast.

618
00:50:55,757 --> 00:50:59,219
I'm sorry,
but two months is just too goddamn long.

619
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:02,967
What? Did you... Did you push
your appointment up? You go in early?

620
00:51:03,072 --> 00:51:05,405
It was fine. There wasn't that much to it.

621
00:51:05,478 --> 00:51:07,106
- You did it, right?
- What?

622
00:51:07,213 --> 00:51:08,945
- You told them.
- Of course.

623
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,251
- And you're okay with it?
- I'd better be, right?

624
00:51:15,463 --> 00:51:16,590
How?

625
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:22,003
How...

626
00:51:23,277 --> 00:51:24,746
How did you do it? You just...

627
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,682
- You walked in and what, said, "I quit"?
- Basically.

628
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:32,661
- They must have tried to talk you out of it.
- Not really, no.

629
00:51:32,762 --> 00:51:35,360
Well, they can't be happy to see you go.
It couldn't have been that easy.

630
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:37,802
What are you trying to tell me?

631
00:51:39,277 --> 00:51:41,610
- You didn't do it, did you?
- Hang on.

632
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,981
There's no way
that they just let you just walk out.

633
00:51:44,052 --> 00:51:47,114
- Wait.
- You just punched out? Just walked out?

634
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:48,387
No, no, no, no, no. Hang on.

635
00:51:48,494 --> 00:51:50,396
- Answer the question.
- Did they ask you to stay?

636
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:52,228
- You're ducking the question.
- They did, didn't they?

637
00:51:52,335 --> 00:51:54,396
- This is classic.
- They asked you to stay.

638
00:51:54,505 --> 00:51:56,532
- I know this drill, okay.
- Did you quit or not?

639
00:51:56,643 --> 00:51:58,340
Deny everything. Admit nothing.

640
00:51:58,414 --> 00:52:00,577
- Make counter-accusations.
- That's what you're doing.

641
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,813
I asked you how it went and you evaded!

642
00:52:02,889 --> 00:52:06,760
How it went?
I just terminated a 12-year career with Ml6.

643
00:52:06,864 --> 00:52:08,561
I spent an hour
signing non-disclosure forms,

644
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:10,932
I did a quick outplacement polygraph,
I turned in my credentials

645
00:52:11,038 --> 00:52:12,871
and I walked out
on the only job I've ever really had,

646
00:52:12,942 --> 00:52:15,846
and now, right now,
I'm getting the very distinct impression

647
00:52:15,914 --> 00:52:20,378
that you changed your mind,
kept your job, and left me out in the cold.

648
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:22,853
They kind of begged me to stay.

649
00:52:22,927 --> 00:52:26,094
And you don't call
to tell me that this morning?

650
00:52:26,201 --> 00:52:27,931
I couldn't risk it.

651
00:52:28,038 --> 00:52:30,304
You're unbelievable.

652
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:33,746
- I was completely surprised.
- I don't believe this.

653
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,219
I hope you kept your passports.

654
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:38,987
What am I supposed to do? I can't go back.

655
00:52:39,092 --> 00:52:41,153
You have to turn in a couple
to make it look good, but...

656
00:52:41,264 --> 00:52:42,755
I am totally cooked.

657
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:45,134
...we're gonna need decent passports.

658
00:52:45,237 --> 00:52:47,402
What are you talking about?

659
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,911
I took everything I could get my hands on.

660
00:52:50,983 --> 00:52:52,849
After they begged me.

661
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:57,159
You bitch.

662
00:53:04,943 --> 00:53:07,880
Admit it.
You don't trust me, either.

663
00:53:28,722 --> 00:53:30,693
So, the total footprint.

664
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,724
That's if you're interested in both buildings,
'cause they're both available right now.

665
00:53:34,835 --> 00:53:39,867
It's about 22,000 square feet.
The ventilation, it's zoned.

666
00:53:39,945 --> 00:53:45,389
And you've got separate filtration systems
for the lab, office, storage and loading.

667
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:48,119
- It's lovely and clean.
- Yes, indeed.

668
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:51,427
The last tenants left the place
in terrific shape. It's just spotless.

669
00:53:51,534 --> 00:53:53,094
What kind of business were they in?

670
00:53:53,204 --> 00:53:57,610
Formavale? Damned if I know.
Some kind of biotech.

671
00:53:57,713 --> 00:54:00,742
They took the place, loaded in their gear
and that's about the last we saw of them.

672
00:54:00,818 --> 00:54:03,916
Hell, they used to truck out their own trash.

673
00:54:06,831 --> 00:54:10,099
Cronin Partiz. Ronnie Partiz.

674
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,641
Dr. Ronald Partiz.

675
00:54:12,742 --> 00:54:15,304
This is 10 years ago up in Albany.

676
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:19,481
He's graduating high school,
15 years old in that picture,

677
00:54:19,588 --> 00:54:21,422
but he's a smart kid.

678
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:23,759
He gets a free ride to Cornell.

679
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:25,925
He finds his way
into the biochemistry department.

680
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:27,561
Two years later, he's in med school.

681
00:54:27,804 --> 00:54:30,367
<i>PAM: He's 18, he's doing research</i>
<i>with some heavy hitters,</i>

682
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,346
<i>he's getting good evaluations,</i>
<i>he's rolling along.</i>

683
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:38,652
1999, he publishes an article in a magazine
called <i>American Dermatologist.</i>

684
00:54:38,726 --> 00:54:41,458
- About?
- Something about a fungus.

685
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:43,668
What kind of fungus?

686
00:54:43,735 --> 00:54:44,896
<i>DUKE: It doesn't matter.</i>

687
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:46,668
<i>RICHARD: Doesn't matter?</i>
<i>Everything matters.</i>

688
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:50,579
He plagiarized it. He stole it.
He got caught immediately.

689
00:54:51,217 --> 00:54:54,657
<i>PAM: They bounced him out of Cornell.</i>
<i>He set up shop in his parents' garage,</i>

690
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:57,822
<i>started working on some kind of skin cream.</i>

691
00:54:57,896 --> 00:54:59,525
Yeah, something called...

692
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,034
- What?
Spring Skin.

693
00:55:01,103 --> 00:55:04,041
He tried to sell it to health food stores
in the area up there.

694
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,876
Now, you're sure this is a cream
or was it a lotion?

695
00:55:06,947 --> 00:55:10,079
- Because a lot of people confuse the two.
- I don't know.

696
00:55:10,186 --> 00:55:14,925
Well, for Christ's sake, Duke, let's have that!
Let's have that! I mean, if...

697
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:18,400
If there is even a chance that this guy
is Tully's secret weapon,

698
00:55:18,469 --> 00:55:21,373
we're gonna need a hell of a lot more
than his goddamn grade point average!

699
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,938
You gotta get me his cream!
Show me the cream!

700
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:28,784
Dick, he went bankrupt overnight.
It was a bust, okay.

701
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:32,661
<i>We don't think the cream</i>
<i>is the answer here.</i>

702
00:55:32,764 --> 00:55:35,737
<i>So, Ronnie Partiz</i>
<i>now goes deep underground.</i>

703
00:55:36,175 --> 00:55:39,342
2002, 2003, nothing.

704
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:43,083
It's as if he doesn't exist.
No taxes, no bank records, nothing.

705
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:46,889
<i>Then, two years ago,</i>
<i>he walks into a bank in Atlanta</i>

706
00:55:46,998 --> 00:55:53,603
and produces a $500,000 letter of credit
and a business card from Formavale.

707
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,876
Now, we've been working hard,
we've been working fast

708
00:55:55,947 --> 00:55:57,713
and yet we can't find anything
about Formavale.

709
00:55:57,784 --> 00:56:00,119
<i>We don't have a vendor,</i>
<i>we don't have an insurance company,</i>

710
00:56:00,222 --> 00:56:01,554
<i>we don't have anybody down there</i>

711
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:04,289
who knows anything about
what the hell Formavale does.

712
00:56:04,398 --> 00:56:06,766
We're working these
New York travel records.

713
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:09,601
Howard Tully bouncing down to Dunwoody
like a busboy.

714
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:14,114
<i>DUKE: Yeah, and two days after Ronald Partiz</i>
<i>sells Formavale Labs to B&R,</i>

715
00:56:14,217 --> 00:56:16,244
<i>three armored trucks</i>
<i>pull up outside the building.</i>

716
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,452
Not only that,
B&R sends a security detail down there

717
00:56:19,561 --> 00:56:21,929
<i>to guard the load out,</i>
<i>which takes place at night.</i>

718
00:56:21,998 --> 00:56:25,233
And consider that B&R has yet to disclose
their financial statements

719
00:56:25,304 --> 00:56:26,568
showing the acquisition.

720
00:56:26,641 --> 00:56:31,309
And then add the fact that Ronnie Partiz
has been living for the last six months

721
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:37,760
<i>in a $10,000-a-day penthouse suite</i>
<i>at the Atlantis Hotel in the Bahamas.</i>

722
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:41,324
And the coup de grâce,
toss in the fact that he is playing baccarat

723
00:56:41,436 --> 00:56:43,804
<i>whenever he's sober enough</i>
<i>to make his way down to the tables</i>

724
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:46,367
<i>to the tune of $300,000 a week.</i>

725
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,782
Duke, God damn it,
you gotta stop waltzing around,

726
00:56:49,853 --> 00:56:52,380
and you have got to get on this guy.

727
00:57:28,427 --> 00:57:30,454
You can forget his room.

728
00:57:30,733 --> 00:57:34,400
It's like Fort Knox up there.
It'd be a major operation.

729
00:57:34,773 --> 00:57:37,574
- I told you.
- So what do you wanna do?

730
00:57:39,717 --> 00:57:41,242
Have a drink.

731
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:57,630
Turn-down service.

732
00:59:23,085 --> 00:59:25,818
This is a waste of time.
You wanna just sit here all night?

733
00:59:25,923 --> 00:59:29,920
Look at him, he's paralyzed.
He couldn't leave if he wanted to.

734
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:35,108
Why don't you give me the credit card,
let me get in the game.

735
00:59:35,175 --> 00:59:37,271
It's a $5,000 table.

736
00:59:37,347 --> 00:59:40,010
That's okay. I'll share my winnings.

737
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,985
Forget it.

738
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,313
Look, maybe you're right.

739
00:59:59,822 --> 01:00:02,088
Maybe tonight he goes nowhere.

740
01:00:02,929 --> 01:00:04,559
What we do?

741
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:07,730
Tonight we watch like this, and tomorrow...

742
01:00:08,507 --> 01:00:12,538
Tomorrow, we'll find somebody
who works upstairs in those rooms, okay?

743
01:00:12,614 --> 01:00:14,608
How's it going, fellows?

744
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,215
- Yeah, we're good, thanks. Very good.
Glad to hear it.

745
01:00:18,293 --> 01:00:20,956
I'm hoping you could help me out.

746
01:00:21,065 --> 01:00:23,865
I need to take a look at your room keys.

747
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:27,536
Well, this is interesting.

748
01:00:27,612 --> 01:00:29,239
Yeah, it is interesting.

749
01:00:29,313 --> 01:00:34,119
A maid just found a whole bunch
of crazy stuff in a couple of rooms upstairs.

750
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:36,818
So here's what we're going to do.

751
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:37,954
The drinks are comped.

752
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:41,802
We're gonna have to take a walk.

753
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,170
And I mean now.

754
01:00:50,454 --> 01:00:53,255
Hey, hey, hey. Get him!
Get off of me.

755
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:17,570
This is so heavy.

756
01:01:17,976 --> 01:01:20,070
Who do you think he is?

757
01:01:20,181 --> 01:01:23,380
It's gotta be this thing.
This new thing, right?

758
01:01:24,322 --> 01:01:25,722
Makes sense.

759
01:01:26,157 --> 01:01:28,094
What else could it be?

760
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:13,139
- Hey, I was getting worried.
- I got off the plane,

761
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,914
- I thought for a minute I was being tailed.
- By who?

762
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:17,856
I don't know.
I was probably just being paranoid.

763
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,326
Well, that's crazy. Nobody knows we're here.

764
01:02:19,429 --> 01:02:22,298
I know. I know, but I didn't know
what else to do. I had to run it out.

765
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:25,168
I've been driving in circles for two hours.
I just... I didn't know what else to do.

766
01:02:25,273 --> 01:02:28,440
I wanted to call, and I just thought, " My God,
we've got everything on the line here."

767
01:02:28,514 --> 01:02:31,143
I didn't want to start off sloppy.

768
01:02:32,054 --> 01:02:35,458
- God, you smell good.
- Please, I smell like a rental car.

769
01:02:35,527 --> 01:02:37,963
Wow. This is amazing.

770
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:41,536
- I upgraded.
- This is more than an upgrade.

771
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:46,239
We're celebrating. I've got some good news.
Well, actually, it's more than good news.

772
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:48,648
- I nailed it.
- Nailed what?

773
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:53,161
We're in. I got it. The answer. The key.
The master plan. I nailed it!

774
01:02:53,762 --> 01:02:55,596
You're kidding.

775
01:02:55,699 --> 01:03:00,106
- Come here. Sit down. Just sit down.
- Okay.

776
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:05,742
How much money do you think was spent
on frozen pizza last year?

777
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:09,282
- What?
- Frozen pizza. How big is the market?

778
01:03:10,262 --> 01:03:13,961
$1 billion. One billion. That's just the pizza.

779
01:03:14,068 --> 01:03:17,199
I'm not talking enchiladas, blintzes,
macaroni and cheese.

780
01:03:17,275 --> 01:03:20,041
Just pizza. Master plan, right?

781
01:03:20,414 --> 01:03:22,943
Objective one, huge market. Got it.

782
01:03:23,487 --> 01:03:25,786
Objective two, conflict, right?

783
01:03:25,891 --> 01:03:28,159
Find a market where the competitors
hate each other so much,

784
01:03:28,264 --> 01:03:29,561
they'll do anything to win.

785
01:03:29,632 --> 01:03:32,628
We get involved, we lead the charge.
When the price is right, we ditch.

786
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:34,572
All we gotta do is find an angle.

787
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:37,443
Maybe we flip sides,
maybe we shop the intel,

788
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:41,351
buy stock, sell it, whatever.
There's a hundred ways to go.

789
01:03:41,456 --> 01:03:43,425
There's this company
called Butter Mills, okay.

790
01:03:43,492 --> 01:03:44,824
Now, about two months ago,

791
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:48,994
the CEO, Mr. Butter Mills, sitting at home,
watching TV with his granddaughter.

792
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:50,664
There's this ad
comes on in the morning cartoons

793
01:03:50,773 --> 01:03:53,175
for something called Double Crust Pizza.

794
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:55,771
This guy's been working on
double-crust pizza for five years,

795
01:03:55,851 --> 01:03:59,380
got $50 million invested,
major new product for him.

796
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:02,327
Trouble is, he hasn't rolled it out yet.

797
01:04:02,898 --> 01:04:06,563
The ad he's watching
is for Flakey Fresh Double Crust.

798
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:11,239
They stole his concept, his formula,
his packaging and his ad campaign.

799
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,873
So Mr. Butter Mills is out for blood.

800
01:04:12,983 --> 01:04:15,250
They're taking off the gloves.
They're bringing out the check book.

801
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:16,983
Here's the best part...

802
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:20,498
Guess who they like
for Director of Intel Operations?

803
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,869
I took a job yesterday.

804
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:26,775
- What?
- That's why I was paranoid.

805
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,344
What do you mean, you took a job?

806
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:34,219
It's not like I could call and tell you.

807
01:04:34,592 --> 01:04:36,460
I don't believe this.

808
01:04:38,065 --> 01:04:39,557
What happened to doing it together?

809
01:04:39,635 --> 01:04:42,197
- Well, it was just too good...
- No, we had a plan.

810
01:04:42,273 --> 01:04:44,244
You know, we agreed.
We said we'd go over everything.

811
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:47,945
We go over it. We do it together.
We said nobody moves alone.

812
01:04:48,052 --> 01:04:50,454
- Ray, please.
- Well, can you get out of it?

813
01:04:50,556 --> 01:04:54,724
Well, of course you can.
You haven't even started yet. Claire...

814
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:56,826
Claire, look, I know that we said
that we're gonna go out there,

815
01:04:56,936 --> 01:04:58,565
get two jobs
and see which one comes up best,

816
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:01,076
but with this, the pizza,

817
01:05:01,144 --> 01:05:04,139
I mean, we can push up the whole timetable.
It's perfect.

818
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:06,152
And we can be together.

819
01:05:06,688 --> 01:05:10,150
Look, I take the job,
you start working out the exit strategy.

820
01:05:10,262 --> 01:05:13,530
You know, you build up our ID, you set up
the banks, offshore trading accounts.

821
01:05:13,635 --> 01:05:16,869
Whatever we need, you get it
up and running and then I bring you in, see.

822
01:05:16,974 --> 01:05:18,842
I'm gonna need to staff up.
You'll apply, we'll meet.

823
01:05:18,945 --> 01:05:22,784
We'll like each other, hate each other,
whatever works best.

824
01:05:24,356 --> 01:05:26,552
Who'd you take the job with?

825
01:05:26,961 --> 01:05:28,396
Equikrom.

826
01:05:28,965 --> 01:05:31,333
- Local?
- New York.

827
01:05:32,739 --> 01:05:34,731
It's two jobs actually.

828
01:05:35,878 --> 01:05:37,507
Equikrom wants to hire me under the table,

829
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:40,052
and then get me a job
on the counterintelligence desk

830
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:42,090
for Burkett & Randle.

831
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,387
They want you to be a mole?

832
01:05:45,264 --> 01:05:46,664
Equikrom?

833
01:05:47,835 --> 01:05:49,235
In New York?

834
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,237
Where's the pizza thing?

835
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:57,418
Cleveland.

836
01:05:59,224 --> 01:06:01,751
You said they offered you the job.

837
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:05,362
Of course they did. They love me.

838
01:06:05,436 --> 01:06:08,373
- You took it on the spot.
- What, like you?

839
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:12,550
Nothing was formalized.

840
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:19,260
Look, seriously,
I don't have to take it.

841
01:06:19,331 --> 01:06:21,597
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

842
01:06:21,668 --> 01:06:24,434
How are we ever
gonna see each other?

843
01:06:24,507 --> 01:06:26,500
Very, very carefully.

844
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:31,751
This is what we wanted, right?

845
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:34,585
I think so.

846
01:06:36,931 --> 01:06:38,297
Come here.

847
01:06:56,536 --> 01:06:58,027
Ms. Stenwick?

848
01:07:03,684 --> 01:07:05,744
Someone made fire.

849
01:07:07,759 --> 01:07:09,420
Someone was first.

850
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,204
I don't mean the idiot who found
a burning stick and kept it going.

851
01:07:14,271 --> 01:07:16,969
I mean the fellow who could make fire.

852
01:07:18,945 --> 01:07:21,884
And until that knowledge was stolen,

853
01:07:23,255 --> 01:07:26,786
that fellow was the most powerful person
on the planet.

854
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:32,400
And it means something to be first.

855
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,110
To be most.

856
01:07:37,148 --> 01:07:39,141
It means a great deal.

857
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:44,693
It means you have an opportunity
to reproduce with the highest frequency

858
01:07:44,797 --> 01:07:47,494
and with the most desirable partners.

859
01:07:47,869 --> 01:07:51,434
It means your offspring
have the greatest chance of survival

860
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:54,777
and a better opportunity
to make their own fire.

861
01:07:55,518 --> 01:07:59,150
I personally believe that human evolution
has run its course.

862
01:07:59,226 --> 01:08:01,661
We live in a world where the people
who can make fire

863
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:03,528
have a tendency to wear condoms,

864
01:08:03,634 --> 01:08:06,902
sit in casinos
and drink themselves into a stupor.

865
01:08:08,009 --> 01:08:11,914
I believe that individual evolution
has been replaced by something else.

866
01:08:12,016 --> 01:08:14,920
By a shared evolution.

867
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:18,521
A communal contest, if you will.

868
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:22,567
I believe, Ms. Stenwick,
in corporate evolution.

869
01:08:24,507 --> 01:08:28,072
I believe that the corporation that is first,
that is the most,

870
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,381
has an opportunity to manufacture
with the highest frequency

871
01:08:31,453 --> 01:08:33,617
and in the most desirable markets,

872
01:08:33,725 --> 01:08:35,854
and that its shareholders, by extension,

873
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:39,768
have the greatest chance of survival
and reinvestment.

874
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,976
I don't imagine you're quite aware
of the service

875
01:08:46,484 --> 01:08:50,047
you and Mr. Bauer
provided this corporation last night.

876
01:08:50,123 --> 01:08:52,560
We were just doing our job, sir.

877
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:55,463
Mr. Partiz may appear a fool,

878
01:08:57,305 --> 01:08:59,332
but he is anything but.

879
01:08:59,443 --> 01:09:03,780
He has given Burkett & Randle a gift
that will change our business,

880
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:06,345
our lives, forever.

881
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:10,362
So the question, Ms. Stenwick,

882
01:09:10,463 --> 01:09:15,337
is whether you can continue to do the job
we so desperately need you to do

883
01:09:16,175 --> 01:09:18,942
without knowing the stakes involved.

884
01:09:19,481 --> 01:09:24,287
Can you really do your job without knowing
what it is that you're protecting?

885
01:09:30,202 --> 01:09:32,229
What I need to know is,

886
01:09:35,578 --> 01:09:38,483
can I share my fire with you?

887
01:09:43,828 --> 01:09:45,730
Little trouble out there
in the field, Ray?

888
01:09:45,832 --> 01:09:46,858
What do you mean?

889
01:09:46,935 --> 01:09:49,600
Well, I just got
a back channel message from Claire,

890
01:09:49,707 --> 01:09:51,233
she wants to meet Garsik.

891
01:09:51,342 --> 01:09:52,606
That's a terrible idea.

892
01:09:52,713 --> 01:09:56,278
Yeah, that's what I told him.
But now he wants direct contact.

893
01:09:56,386 --> 01:09:57,719
Forget it.

894
01:10:00,795 --> 01:10:03,789
- It's his dime.
- Yeah, and she's my agent.

895
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:07,032
I told you when I came on board.
Once she's mine, I run her my way.

896
01:10:07,108 --> 01:10:11,743
Yeah, well the question's been raised, Ray,
is it just her you're running?

897
01:10:14,922 --> 01:10:17,324
You'd better explain that to me.

898
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:22,631
<i>RAY O VER PHONE: American Consulate,</i>
<i>Dubai, you and me, Fourth of July, 2003.</i>

899
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:23,966
<i>CLAIRE O VER PHONE:</i>
<i>Find someone else to bother.</i>

900
01:10:24,074 --> 01:10:26,271
<i>RAY: Red, white and blue margaritas.</i>
<i>CLAIRE: Stay away from me.</i>

901
01:10:26,345 --> 01:10:31,150
<i>RAY: I had a knee brace, you had toe rings.</i>
<i>First toe ring I ever saw, by the way.</i>

902
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:36,020
Well, I'll give her this.
She is one cold, nasty piece of work.

903
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:41,163
- When did she send this to you?
- She didn't tape it. You did.

904
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:45,140
We had a bug in your phone.
We had the whole thing wired.

905
01:10:45,216 --> 01:10:49,350
Hey, we had to. New guy on the team?
This late in the game?

906
01:10:49,457 --> 01:10:53,293
What can I tell you?
The bitch put me through the wringer.

907
01:10:53,631 --> 01:10:55,966
Look, if I'd have known it was her,
I would never have taken the job.

908
01:10:56,037 --> 01:11:00,501
- No, no. You didn't tell us the truth, Ray.
- Are you firing me, Duke?

909
01:11:00,979 --> 01:11:02,608
Why didn't you do it then?
Why not fire me that day?

910
01:11:02,682 --> 01:11:04,778
- Why keep me around?
Why?

911
01:11:06,823 --> 01:11:12,962
Because you're the biggest swinging dick
I've ever seen.

912
01:11:19,649 --> 01:11:22,644
Come on! We thought we were losing her.

913
01:11:22,721 --> 01:11:25,853
We thought we'd had her out there too long
and she'd gone off the rails.

914
01:11:25,927 --> 01:11:27,693
And that's why we brought you in.

915
01:11:27,765 --> 01:11:30,998
But this?
This is more than we ever expected.

916
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:34,601
When you drop the hammer on her,
when you take her to the bar...

917
01:11:34,712 --> 01:11:36,545
<i>CLAIRE O VER PHONE:</i>
<i>You've 10 seconds to get your hand off me.</i>

918
01:11:36,615 --> 01:11:38,083
<i>RAY O VER PHONE:</i>
<i>Or what? You won't be my friend anymore?</i>

919
01:11:38,185 --> 01:11:41,350
No, no, no, no, no.
Do the other one. Do the other one.

920
01:11:41,425 --> 01:11:43,360
- Okay. Here.
- Right.

921
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:46,697
<i>RAY: Now, maybe you're so used to having</i>
<i>your legs in the air you don't realize it,</i>

922
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:48,898
<i>but you're upside down, sister.</i>

923
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,069
<i>I own you.</i>

924
01:11:51,744 --> 01:11:54,409
Damn! Man, I wish I had video on this!

925
01:11:54,484 --> 01:11:56,282
"I own you."

926
01:11:57,590 --> 01:12:00,926
- Who else knows about this?
- Just me, just me and Dale.

927
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:03,057
So you were just kidding
about the meet with Garsik, right?

928
01:12:03,134 --> 01:12:05,296
No, no. That's for real.
But don't worry about her.

929
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:08,171
I mean, obviously, she doesn't need to know
that we know what's going on,

930
01:12:08,278 --> 01:12:10,805
so you just keep...
You know, just play it straight.

931
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:12,077
Of course.

932
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:15,145
<i>RAY: I don't know. I mean,</i>
<i>I'm not great on names. I should be. I try.</i>

933
01:12:15,256 --> 01:12:18,252
<i>Faces, I'm definitely better.</i>
<i>Faces, I'm like a B, B minus.</i>

934
01:12:18,329 --> 01:12:22,167
<i>Where I'm good, where I really excel,</i>
<i>people I've slept with.</i>

935
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,306
- "I own you."
- "I own you."

936
01:12:25,377 --> 01:12:26,277
- "I own you."
"I own you."

937
01:13:21,621 --> 01:13:23,590
You should have called.

938
01:13:24,259 --> 01:13:26,729
I could have been home hours ago.

939
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:33,608
- Where's your bag?
- I'm on the red-eye.

940
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:35,442
- No.
- I'm supposed to be in Houston.

941
01:13:35,515 --> 01:13:38,350
I had to blow my connection. It was
the only way I'd steal a couple of hours.

942
01:13:38,453 --> 01:13:39,512
You should have paged me.

943
01:13:39,622 --> 01:13:42,753
I've been sitting in the office
doing field reports, for Christ's sake.

944
01:13:42,828 --> 01:13:44,319
I couldn't risk it.

945
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:47,095
- From a pay phone?
- Not from anywhere.

946
01:13:47,872 --> 01:13:50,341
Why? What's going on?

947
01:13:52,014 --> 01:13:54,951
- Nigel Bingham.
- Nigel Bingham?

948
01:13:55,019 --> 01:13:58,047
- You were together in Athens.
- He was my station chief.

949
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:00,788
- You still on good terms?
- Great. Why?

950
01:14:01,297 --> 01:14:03,701
Equikrom, the special unit, they're hiring.

951
01:14:03,802 --> 01:14:07,242
Duke needs a field agent.
I figured out a way to get you in.

952
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:09,836
It's happening, Ray. It's war.

953
01:14:09,914 --> 01:14:13,512
- What do you mean, war?
- I mean like a total corporate death match.

954
01:14:13,588 --> 01:14:16,685
We're on. B&R is about to make a move.

955
01:14:16,761 --> 01:14:20,164
- What kind of move?
- Some new product. Something big.

956
01:14:20,234 --> 01:14:22,000
What do you mean, "big"?

957
01:14:22,072 --> 01:14:26,409
Big, big like we've had four top-down
tech sweeps in the last two weeks.

958
01:14:26,512 --> 01:14:30,748
Big like three days ago
we started auditing passwords hourly.

959
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:33,524
This morning I got a message from Duke.

960
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:36,463
He wants me to go active.
I'm gonna get word to him tomorrow

961
01:14:36,567 --> 01:14:40,404
that unless he gets me a great field officer
to work with he can forget it.

962
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:42,911
You're gonna get that job.

963
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,743
Without knowing what the product is?

964
01:14:44,815 --> 01:14:47,149
Well, that's the point. Nobody knows.

965
01:14:47,253 --> 01:14:49,121
All we have to do is get there first.

966
01:14:49,225 --> 01:14:52,390
You on one side, me on the other.
It's perfect.

967
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,136
What does all this have to do
with Nigel Bingham?

968
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:58,835
He's Duke's drinking buddy.
They play cards twice a week.

969
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,967
You call Nigel.

970
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:02,140
You're just checking in,
you're stuck in Cleveland,

971
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,345
you're going crazy,
you're calling everybody.

972
01:15:04,453 --> 01:15:07,186
Tell him you're desperate to get to New York.

973
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:09,992
Aren't you desperate to get to New York?

974
01:15:10,099 --> 01:15:14,368
- Well, yeah, of course I am, but it's just...
- Just what?

975
01:15:14,474 --> 01:15:17,274
Well, the pizza thing's really heating up.

976
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,376
We're launching Frozen Hawaiian
next month, pineapple and ham.

977
01:15:20,485 --> 01:15:23,047
First time anyone's ever done that.

978
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:25,488
Congratulations.

979
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:26,895
Well, it's not the first first time

980
01:15:26,997 --> 01:15:29,970
'cause those weasels at Flakey Fresh
stole the idea from Butter Mills,

981
01:15:30,037 --> 01:15:31,837
and then, you'll love this,

982
01:15:31,908 --> 01:15:35,539
we find out that the Vice President of
Marketing has this 22-year-old assistant

983
01:15:35,648 --> 01:15:39,917
who's $60,000 in debt
to a TV shopping network. Bingo.

984
01:15:40,492 --> 01:15:41,858
Really.

985
01:15:43,698 --> 01:15:45,256
Are these hers?

986
01:15:46,569 --> 01:15:47,832
What is that?

987
01:15:47,905 --> 01:15:50,569
It's a thong. It was in your closet.

988
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,216
That's not possible.

989
01:15:55,621 --> 01:15:57,591
Well, whose are they?

990
01:15:58,393 --> 01:16:01,957
- Nobody's because it's impossible.
- Impossible what?

991
01:16:02,368 --> 01:16:06,363
That someone would leave them,
or you'd forget or that I'd find them?

992
01:16:06,443 --> 01:16:09,380
Impossible because I've been faithful.
Which closet?

993
01:16:09,448 --> 01:16:11,975
- Which closet?
- This is insane.

994
01:16:12,086 --> 01:16:14,386
- You're denying this?
- Absolutely.

995
01:16:14,457 --> 01:16:17,122
The only woman who's been in this place
since I moved in is the landlady

996
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:19,256
and she couldn't wear that as a wristband.

997
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:21,235
So where did they come from?

998
01:16:21,305 --> 01:16:24,104
Look, I swear to you.

999
01:16:24,176 --> 01:16:26,646
Claire, I swear,
I swear on all things good and true,

1000
01:16:26,747 --> 01:16:29,583
I have no idea who they belong to.
And the fact that you don't believe me,

1001
01:16:29,654 --> 01:16:31,953
the fact that we've been through
everything that we've been through

1002
01:16:32,024 --> 01:16:36,625
and that you still don't trust me on this,
is, quite frankly, disturbing.

1003
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:40,372
Well, in that case, I'll put them back on.

1004
01:16:41,042 --> 01:16:42,601
They're yours?

1005
01:16:42,679 --> 01:16:44,376
You passed.

1006
01:16:44,483 --> 01:16:46,179
You're gaming me?

1007
01:16:46,286 --> 01:16:48,779
I just needed to hear you say it.

1008
01:16:52,532 --> 01:16:55,230
- You're that upset?
- Yeah, I think so.

1009
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,012
But kind of turned on, too, right?

1010
01:17:08,095 --> 01:17:12,900
The drag is I've only got 55 minutes
to make it up to you.

1011
01:17:54,987 --> 01:17:56,421
Forget it.

1012
01:17:59,261 --> 01:18:01,163
I never liked this game.

1013
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:05,797
Any sport that puts a limit on your score
is a complete waste of time.

1014
01:18:06,676 --> 01:18:08,805
Three hundred, that's it?

1015
01:18:08,881 --> 01:18:12,844
What, are you gonna bust your nut to do
something 9 million other jokers might do?

1016
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:14,720
Stupidest damn thing I ever heard of.

1017
01:18:14,826 --> 01:18:18,127
Okay, so don't turn around,
but she just came in.

1018
01:18:19,201 --> 01:18:22,195
- We're cool though, right? She see us?
- Oh, yeah.

1019
01:18:22,306 --> 01:18:25,005
- I look natural, right?
- Super natural.

1020
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,319
Who picked this place?

1021
01:18:31,391 --> 01:18:34,386
- You have a problem?
- It's a little bright.

1022
01:18:35,364 --> 01:18:38,359
- So this gentleman here is...
- I know who he is.

1023
01:18:38,471 --> 01:18:41,807
You do? Even with the hat?

1024
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,877
She's a trained professional.

1025
01:18:44,984 --> 01:18:47,421
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

1026
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,387
I can definitely...

1027
01:18:51,329 --> 01:18:53,664
Would you...
You know what, we got beers here.

1028
01:18:53,734 --> 01:18:55,168
- Would you care for something?
- She's fine.

1029
01:18:55,238 --> 01:18:58,404
- I'm starving.
- Well, hell, then we should feed you.

1030
01:18:58,511 --> 01:19:00,605
I'd love some pizza.
Do you think they have pizza?

1031
01:19:00,715 --> 01:19:02,412
I'll just bet that they do, yeah.

1032
01:19:02,519 --> 01:19:04,045
- Or even frozen pizza.
- Okay.

1033
01:19:04,122 --> 01:19:06,684
- I don't think so.
- Why don't you go take a look-see?

1034
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,229
You'd smell it if they did.

1035
01:19:08,296 --> 01:19:12,896
I don't give a damn if you have to go
to Sicily, get the lady some pizza!

1036
01:19:15,912 --> 01:19:17,814
Any particular topping you'd like?

1037
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,384
Surprise me.

1038
01:19:24,295 --> 01:19:25,456
Pepperoni.

1039
01:19:26,666 --> 01:19:28,931
Super Cheese-a-peno.

1040
01:19:29,572 --> 01:19:31,404
Mushroom.

1041
01:19:32,176 --> 01:19:33,975
Mushroom and onion.

1042
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:37,146
Plain.

1043
01:19:37,854 --> 01:19:39,824
- Hawaiian.
- Plain.

1044
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:47,795
- Do you like it hot or...
- Yeah, hot. Very hot.

1045
01:19:48,876 --> 01:19:50,435
Extremely hot.

1046
01:19:54,654 --> 01:19:56,555
You want something to drink?

1047
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:58,685
Yeah, sure, whatever.

1048
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,704
What's going on? What just happened?

1049
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:10,649
You...

1050
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:13,185
You gotta get Duke. You gotta get Duke.

1051
01:20:13,256 --> 01:20:16,717
And you've gotta tell him
to get me a secure line

1052
01:20:16,829 --> 01:20:18,229
because he's gotta call me right away.

1053
01:20:18,332 --> 01:20:20,827
- What did she say?
- Secure line.

1054
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:23,534
Do you understand me?
And only if he is sure.

1055
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:26,081
I gotta get on the plane,
and he's gotta call me,

1056
01:20:26,181 --> 01:20:28,583
but it has gotta be safe.

1057
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:46,752
Yeah, it's me. I need Duke. Now.

1058
01:20:48,492 --> 01:20:50,984
Yeah. Well, tell him to hurry up.

1059
01:22:15,094 --> 01:22:16,893
What are you doing?

1060
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:18,725
Me?

1061
01:22:18,801 --> 01:22:21,500
- How did you get here so fast?
- Not fast enough though, right?

1062
01:22:21,606 --> 01:22:23,667
- You're leaving?
- I didn't think you were coming.

1063
01:22:23,778 --> 01:22:24,972
I left the signal, didn't I?

1064
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:27,175
You also took your passports
and the travel money.

1065
01:22:27,284 --> 01:22:29,186
Half the money. My half.

1066
01:22:29,288 --> 01:22:32,658
We took a vow. No one touches
the mayday pouch until it's time to bail.

1067
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:33,820
I trusted you.

1068
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:36,630
Which explains
why you were in there checking it.

1069
01:22:36,703 --> 01:22:38,296
- When did you do this?
- When?

1070
01:22:38,372 --> 01:22:43,279
About five or six hours after I got done
with Barbara Bofferd from B&R Travel.

1071
01:22:44,051 --> 01:22:45,645
You're kidding.

1072
01:22:46,689 --> 01:22:49,182
- That's what this is about?
- That?

1073
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:52,164
We're in play, for Christ's sake.
We don't have time for this.

1074
01:22:52,234 --> 01:22:54,533
Why? Is it a long explanation?

1075
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:56,572
Walk.

1076
01:22:57,076 --> 01:22:58,636
What the hell did you just tell Garsik?

1077
01:22:58,712 --> 01:23:00,409
- You're unbelievable.
- What's the secret?

1078
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:03,009
- You screwed her!
- Yeah. For us. For the project.

1079
01:23:03,087 --> 01:23:06,253
- I can't believe you screwed her!
- It was an assignment. It was nothing.

1080
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,694
Well, you should see the pictures.

1081
01:23:07,764 --> 01:23:09,595
Well, you're the last person
I need to explain this to.

1082
01:23:09,699 --> 01:23:11,328
The only difference
between this and our first date

1083
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:13,600
is that no one was drugged into a coma
and left for dead.

1084
01:23:13,707 --> 01:23:16,407
Left for dead? You were asleep in bed
with a smile on your face!

1085
01:23:16,514 --> 01:23:18,574
- Yeah, for 18 bloody hours!
- See, there it is.

1086
01:23:18,685 --> 01:23:20,847
- You can't get past Dubai, can you?
- What's the product, Claire?

1087
01:23:20,921 --> 01:23:22,891
- You say that you can, but you can't.
- What is the product?

1088
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,421
All right, you know what,
I did come back here to clear out my stuff.

1089
01:23:26,533 --> 01:23:28,765
All right, I was gone. I was ready to bail.

1090
01:23:28,872 --> 01:23:31,434
I got the pouch out, I'm halfway there,
and I suddenly realize,

1091
01:23:31,542 --> 01:23:35,779
"Oh, my God! What are you doing?
This is good. This could work. It's payback.

1092
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:39,449
"We take Dubai, the travel tramp, call it even,
move on, never mention it again."

1093
01:23:39,559 --> 01:23:41,118
So, there I am, I'm loading it all back in,

1094
01:23:41,228 --> 01:23:42,662
I'm putting everything away,
like it never happened,

1095
01:23:42,765 --> 01:23:46,225
and I suddenly realize
there's something missing.

1096
01:23:46,305 --> 01:23:48,640
- Where's Ray's Canadian passport?
- Okay, slow down.

1097
01:23:48,743 --> 01:23:50,645
Which I know for a fact
is supposed to be in there

1098
01:23:50,747 --> 01:23:52,979
because I'm the one
who taped the whole thing together!

1099
01:23:53,086 --> 01:23:55,420
Yes, okay?
Yes, I took the Canadian passport.

1100
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,789
One passport. Why?
Because I was paranoid.

1101
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:00,127
All this probing and testing
and not trusting me, it gets to you.

1102
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:02,135
I thought, what's the harm
in having one little parachute

1103
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,364
in case the plane goes down?

1104
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:05,966
I wanted a hole card. That's it.
That's all it was.

1105
01:24:06,043 --> 01:24:09,814
And the travel lady, did I have to go
that far? Maybe not. But it worked.

1106
01:24:09,885 --> 01:24:13,345
And you know what, that's my cover.
That's always been my cover.

1107
01:24:13,457 --> 01:24:17,023
I'm a mess. I'm a horndog. I'm a slob.
But that's my edge.

1108
01:24:17,132 --> 01:24:18,725
I mean, we're here trying to run a triple game

1109
01:24:18,835 --> 01:24:21,305
on some very smart
and very motivated players.

1110
01:24:21,373 --> 01:24:23,640
What do you want me to do,
play with one hand behind my back?

1111
01:24:23,712 --> 01:24:26,376
It wasn't your hand I was talking about.

1112
01:24:26,484 --> 01:24:28,750
You know what? Get over it.

1113
01:24:29,155 --> 01:24:31,216
You know what? I'm there.

1114
01:24:33,564 --> 01:24:34,725
So what are you saying?

1115
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:37,895
Same split, new rules.
You keep your parachute. I'll keep mine.

1116
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:40,170
- You're that jealous?
- No, I'm that focused.

1117
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:42,007
I've got two years invested in this,

1118
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:45,917
and the last thing I'm gonna do is let some
stupid, immature personal baggage

1119
01:24:46,021 --> 01:24:48,515
compromise an otherwise
successful operation.

1120
01:24:48,594 --> 01:24:50,587
- So we're strictly business now.
- Deal with it.

1121
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:53,260
Well, it might help if I knew
what kind of business we were in.

1122
01:24:53,368 --> 01:24:56,238
Hair. They can grow hair.

1123
01:24:56,742 --> 01:24:58,439
Where it belongs.

1124
01:24:59,582 --> 01:25:00,708
You mean what? Like...

1125
01:25:00,783 --> 01:25:04,724
Like, from now on, Ronnie Partiz
will be the patron saint to all bald men.

1126
01:25:04,792 --> 01:25:08,162
- Except there won't be any bald men.
- A cure for baldness?

1127
01:25:08,265 --> 01:25:13,675
Burkett & Randle Wash and Grow Shampoo,
enriched with activated Partizonol.

1128
01:25:15,814 --> 01:25:18,444
- Hair? That's like...
- It's huge.

1129
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:22,524
Huge? It's beyond huge.
It makes huge look bloody microscopic.

1130
01:25:22,627 --> 01:25:26,362
Do you have any idea what this is worth?
I mean, hair.

1131
01:25:28,337 --> 01:25:31,502
To grow hair, to own that,
that's the all-time Holy Grail.

1132
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:33,807
No wonder they've been so crazy.

1133
01:25:33,881 --> 01:25:36,478
I mean, we're sitting here
on a cure for baldness

1134
01:25:36,554 --> 01:25:39,287
and you're getting worked up
about some meaningless incident.

1135
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:43,628
- We don't have it.
- We don't? But it's a formula though, right?

1136
01:25:44,168 --> 01:25:47,630
It has to be. It has to be a formula
with a patent application.

1137
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:50,235
- So who's got it? Where is it?
- I don't know.

1138
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:52,043
If you did,
you'd be sharing that, though, right?

1139
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:55,453
If I were holding out on you,
what would I be doing here now?

1140
01:25:55,524 --> 01:25:57,186
How about pretending
to be pissed off and jealous

1141
01:25:57,293 --> 01:25:59,059
just to keep me from thinking
what was really going on.

1142
01:25:59,164 --> 01:26:00,497
That's sick, even for you.

1143
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:02,502
Yeah, and that's not the answer
I was looking for.

1144
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:03,903
Quiet.

1145
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:06,572
Hello.

1146
01:26:06,845 --> 01:26:08,838
Claire? It's Ned.

1147
01:26:09,385 --> 01:26:13,154
I need you back at the office.
Now. Like immediately.

1148
01:26:14,527 --> 01:26:17,020
I'll be downstairs in 10 minutes.

1149
01:26:19,203 --> 01:26:21,537
I have to go. That was Guston.
I have to get back to the office.

1150
01:26:21,608 --> 01:26:23,703
We don't have any partners
I don't know about, do we?

1151
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:25,942
Yeah, that's what I want. More partners.

1152
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:28,715
It would be so stupid to burn me now.

1153
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:31,685
I have to go.

1154
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:35,264
- We're not gonna talk about this?
- You said it. We're in play.

1155
01:26:35,368 --> 01:26:38,067
- We don't have time.
- Claire...

1156
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,226
We had a motion detector
go off on 31, near Mr. Tully's office.

1157
01:26:52,301 --> 01:26:53,930
There's some document rooms up there.

1158
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:55,907
We found one of the security cages
wide open,

1159
01:26:55,975 --> 01:26:57,603
and we started turning on the lights.

1160
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,807
We heard some scurrying around,
had a little foot race.

1161
01:26:59,917 --> 01:27:01,510
It took a couple minutes,
but we found him down here

1162
01:27:01,618 --> 01:27:02,985
- hiding under the desk.
- Jesus.

1163
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:04,182
We get to running his ID...
- Ned!

1164
01:27:04,292 --> 01:27:06,694
...he starts trying to tell us the whole thing
was some kind of security test.

1165
01:27:06,796 --> 01:27:08,197
Hey, Ned, get these things off me!

1166
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,203
We said, " Hey, that's great,
but we still gotta call your boss."

1167
01:27:11,305 --> 01:27:12,934
That's when he started sweating.

1168
01:27:13,007 --> 01:27:15,307
- Where's the thing?
Yeah, he had this.

1169
01:27:15,378 --> 01:27:19,149
- "Partizonol 6.1."
Ned, I can explain this!

1170
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:22,556
Shut up, Jeff. Did you open this?
No.

1171
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:25,631
- Did anybody else touch this?
- No, sir, just us and the suspect.

1172
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:30,335
Suspect? Well, that's no suspect.
You're not a suspect, are you, Jeff?

1173
01:27:30,408 --> 01:27:33,404
You're a backstabbing little weasel,
and you're gonna burn, asshole.

1174
01:27:33,515 --> 01:27:35,314
Okay. Okay, I want a lawyer!

1175
01:27:35,385 --> 01:27:37,377
Forget the lawyer, weasel.
What you need is a net

1176
01:27:37,488 --> 01:27:40,188
'cause I'm gonna throw
your backstabbing ass out the window!

1177
01:27:40,261 --> 01:27:41,855
Is the area upstairs secure now?

1178
01:27:41,931 --> 01:27:43,695
Yeah, are you sure
there's no one else upstairs?

1179
01:27:43,768 --> 01:27:45,738
It's gotta be cleared out before it's re-armed.

1180
01:27:45,838 --> 01:27:49,438
- How long does that take?
- All three floors? 20 minutes.

1181
01:27:49,546 --> 01:27:52,451
Go. Go now. Do it.

1182
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:56,387
- What about him?
- He's not going anywhere. Go!

1183
01:27:57,094 --> 01:27:59,189
Okay. Back here, 20 minutes.

1184
01:27:59,265 --> 01:28:02,135
Hey, where are you going?
Hey, get back here!

1185
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:05,641
Don't leave me here with him!
You heard what he said!

1186
01:28:05,743 --> 01:28:08,648
Hey, I mean it! Ned, come on. Claire!

1187
01:28:13,327 --> 01:28:15,228
Okay, you stay here with Jeff.

1188
01:28:15,296 --> 01:28:17,323
I'm gonna run downstairs
and toss his office.

1189
01:28:17,434 --> 01:28:19,404
- You don't wanna call it in?
- No.

1190
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:23,467
All right, we gotta take the lead
so no one else gets involved.

1191
01:28:23,578 --> 01:28:25,412
What about that?

1192
01:28:25,917 --> 01:28:31,485
Leave it. Don't move it. Don't touch it.
Just leave it. All right?

1193
01:28:32,264 --> 01:28:35,257
And relax, okay. I'm gonna call it in.

1194
01:28:35,603 --> 01:28:39,940
Let's just figure out what we're into.
Just hold the fort, all right?

1195
01:28:47,826 --> 01:28:49,386
<i>DUKE: Hair is power.</i>

1196
01:28:49,497 --> 01:28:53,561
What this does is it returns to man
his original state, his virility.

1197
01:28:53,671 --> 01:28:55,641
- Don't laugh. Excuse me.
- Duke, I think you really...

1198
01:28:55,708 --> 01:28:56,734
Excuse me. Don't laugh.

1199
01:28:56,844 --> 01:28:57,903
Seriously,
I think you need to relax.

1200
01:28:58,012 --> 01:29:00,746
- Hey, what's up, dude?
- Hey, Ray, so where the hell you been?

1201
01:29:00,851 --> 01:29:02,685
I thought I picked up a tail
leaving the bowling alley.

1202
01:29:02,756 --> 01:29:04,817
Hey, I've been trying to call you, man.
Where's that cell phone?

1203
01:29:04,894 --> 01:29:06,828
- My battery kicked it.
- D'you want to get some pizza.

1204
01:29:06,898 --> 01:29:07,990
- Don't you want anything?
- No, I'm good.

1205
01:29:08,067 --> 01:29:10,002
- All right.
- Cool.

1206
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:12,166
So what is it, guys?

1207
01:29:12,574 --> 01:29:14,943
- What's the secret?
- The secret?

1208
01:29:17,283 --> 01:29:18,514
Hair.

1209
01:29:22,862 --> 01:29:27,359
All right, listen to me, Claire. Forget Ned.
Okay? Forget Tully.

1210
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:31,411
Do you have any idea what this is worth?
They can grow hair!

1211
01:29:31,511 --> 01:29:33,675
Okay? They can restore hair.

1212
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,981
Do you have any idea
what we could sell this for?

1213
01:29:36,054 --> 01:29:38,046
What Garsik would pay for this?

1214
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:41,323
They haven't delivered the patent yet, Claire.
It's an open technology.

1215
01:29:41,398 --> 01:29:44,564
Now, there it is. I can see it. It's a fortune.
It's just... All right.

1216
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:48,907
Claire! All right, just wait. Wait.
Claire, listen. Listen to me.

1217
01:29:50,015 --> 01:29:52,850
There's always been a spark between us.
You know that!

1218
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,551
Now that night on the plane...
Claire, come on!

1219
01:29:55,626 --> 01:29:57,060
God, Claire!

1220
01:30:13,661 --> 01:30:14,923
We're up.

1221
01:30:15,163 --> 01:30:16,496
<i>CLAIRE: I got it.</i>

1222
01:30:17,935 --> 01:30:20,635
- Where's Dinesh?
- He's right behind you.

1223
01:30:21,175 --> 01:30:25,411
Dinesh! Dinesh! She's got it.
Come on, let's go. She's got it.

1224
01:30:25,484 --> 01:30:27,680
- Got what?
- She's got the formula.

1225
01:30:27,788 --> 01:30:30,920
She's on the 24th floor of the B&R building.

1226
01:30:30,994 --> 01:30:33,693
She can't walk it out. She's gotta send it.

1227
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,429
All those copiers you hacked,
where is the closest one?

1228
01:30:35,503 --> 01:30:37,701
Just give me one second, Ray!

1229
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:41,613
- Just give me something close.
- One second.

1230
01:30:42,015 --> 01:30:44,282
Twenty-two, 23,
I know there's something in there.

1231
01:30:44,354 --> 01:30:46,791
Guys, come on,
we don't have a lot of time here.

1232
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:49,226
- Human Resources, 22.
- Twenty-first floor.

1233
01:30:49,329 --> 01:30:51,390
There's a machine
on the 21st floor. I marked it. It's here.

1234
01:30:51,568 --> 01:30:54,801
- Where am I going?
- Hang on. Just... Just hang on.

1235
01:30:55,376 --> 01:30:56,673
Where am I sending her?

1236
01:30:56,744 --> 01:30:59,376
Tell me there's a system here.
Give me a second. I'm gonna find it.

1237
01:30:59,484 --> 01:31:03,856
21st floor, Human Resources.
Get that open, give me the machine number.

1238
01:31:04,326 --> 01:31:06,854
- Are you all right?
Yeah.

1239
01:31:11,372 --> 01:31:12,533
Guys?

1240
01:31:14,046 --> 01:31:16,037
Not a lot of time here, Ray.

1241
01:31:16,149 --> 01:31:18,085
Guys, you're gonna blow it.
Tell me where to send her!

1242
01:31:18,186 --> 01:31:20,019
- Twenty-one, Ray!
- Twenty-one.

1243
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:22,390
Can you get down to the 21st floor?

1244
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:31,704
Just look for red. Anything red.
I flagged the hits in red.

1245
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:33,247
It's red. It's circled.
- Just one?

1246
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:34,578
There's a couple with more than just one.

1247
01:31:34,685 --> 01:31:37,747
No, there's just one. That's all I see.
It's a number. They're all just numbers.

1248
01:31:37,858 --> 01:31:41,228
One minute. She needs a room, name,
something. Where am I sending her?

1249
01:31:41,298 --> 01:31:43,792
Look for the numbers I circled.
I gotta get the book.

1250
01:31:43,903 --> 01:31:45,770
- What are you doing?
MR...

1251
01:31:45,873 --> 01:31:47,810
No! Hang on! I need the book!

1252
01:31:47,911 --> 01:31:50,244
She's on the way, guys.
We're leaving her hanging here.

1253
01:31:50,315 --> 01:31:51,648
I'm gonna find it!

1254
01:31:54,423 --> 01:31:57,088
- It's an MR number, right?
Yeah, MR-6432.

1255
01:31:57,162 --> 01:31:58,926
- So it'll be in the front.
- What do you mean in the front?

1256
01:31:58,998 --> 01:32:01,231
- In the book! Look in the book.
- I am looking in the book,

1257
01:32:01,305 --> 01:32:04,173
- but this thing is a mess!
- Right here. Hang on.

1258
01:32:04,275 --> 01:32:06,747
See, right here in the front. First page.

1259
01:32:06,814 --> 01:32:09,114
Is it gonna work?
If it's not gonna work, tell me now.

1260
01:32:09,185 --> 01:32:10,619
All I see is a list of names!

1261
01:32:10,689 --> 01:32:13,126
Beside the name.
Match the name to the numbers.

1262
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,288
- Is it going to work?
- Get the phone out of here, Ray!

1263
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:17,926
Are you crazy? It'll kill the phone!

1264
01:32:18,704 --> 01:32:21,038
Okay. Where? Where am I going?

1265
01:32:22,279 --> 01:32:23,770
What? Shit!

1266
01:32:26,185 --> 01:32:28,452
Ray.
- Come on. Come on.

1267
01:32:28,524 --> 01:32:31,119
- Hey, Ray, are the bars moving?
- What?

1268
01:32:31,195 --> 01:32:33,063
The scan trace on the Ghost.
The bars, are they moving?

1269
01:32:33,166 --> 01:32:35,636
- I've lost her!
Well, just tell me if it's working.

1270
01:32:35,703 --> 01:32:36,729
Yeah, but it's not gonna make much...

1271
01:32:38,009 --> 01:32:39,136
Claire?

1272
01:32:39,212 --> 01:32:41,738
What the hell is going on over there?
Can you guys handle this or what?

1273
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:44,878
Yeah, no, no, no, we're good.
We're getting it. Just hang on in there.

1274
01:32:44,988 --> 01:32:46,047
Yes, the bars, they're moving.

1275
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:49,859
Clenteen, Edgar. Human Resources, 21.
C-L-E-N...

1276
01:32:53,538 --> 01:32:54,564
Claire!

1277
01:32:55,109 --> 01:32:56,872
There are no names.

1278
01:32:58,215 --> 01:33:00,377
No, I'm not seeing any names.

1279
01:33:01,087 --> 01:33:03,113
We're good! We're in! I'm in!

1280
01:33:03,225 --> 01:33:06,355
That's great, but there's no
names on the offices. Where is she going?

1281
01:33:06,431 --> 01:33:08,264
I don't... I don't map it that way, Ray.
I don't know.

1282
01:33:08,368 --> 01:33:09,927
Hang on! Hang on!

1283
01:33:15,148 --> 01:33:16,947
What is that? What've you got?

1284
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:20,252
Clenteen, Edgar. H.R., 21st floor.

1285
01:33:20,324 --> 01:33:23,729
- Where?
- I don't see it. They don't list offices.

1286
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,393
- They give his number?
- What?

1287
01:33:25,469 --> 01:33:27,939
Call him. Call the guy's phone. Now.

1288
01:33:50,618 --> 01:33:51,711
All right, I'm here. I'm ready.

1289
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:53,215
She's in. She's found it.

1290
01:33:53,322 --> 01:33:55,189
How many pages?
- How many pages is it?

1291
01:33:55,292 --> 01:33:56,386
One. There's just one page.

1292
01:33:56,729 --> 01:33:57,823
One.

1293
01:34:04,545 --> 01:34:06,878
Ray, really, we've gotta do this now.
I can't keep waiting.

1294
01:34:07,048 --> 01:34:10,511
- She's ready. What are we doing?
- Almost. Almost there.

1295
01:34:10,923 --> 01:34:13,485
Go over there, grab some maps,
find another machine.

1296
01:34:13,563 --> 01:34:15,863
- Why?
- In case we need a backup.

1297
01:34:25,685 --> 01:34:26,711
Almost there.

1298
01:34:31,597 --> 01:34:35,195
- Go! I'm in! All she's gotta do is scan it!
- Go. Do it.

1299
01:34:55,143 --> 01:34:57,010
There's nothing on it.

1300
01:34:57,113 --> 01:34:59,243
<i>RAY: It's coming through,</i>
<i>but there's nothing on it.</i>

1301
01:35:01,957 --> 01:35:04,291
Guys, what the hell is going on?

1302
01:35:04,828 --> 01:35:05,853
It's blank!

1303
01:35:05,963 --> 01:35:07,934
Shit!
It should be working!

1304
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:10,699
Try it again. Do we have a backup?

1305
01:35:41,567 --> 01:35:43,195
- We got it.
- Yes!

1306
01:35:45,742 --> 01:35:47,074
We did it.

1307
01:35:49,582 --> 01:35:50,676
Claire?

1308
01:36:07,885 --> 01:36:10,515
- Having fun?
- Where'd you go?

1309
01:36:14,029 --> 01:36:18,869
- I've just been watching you.
- Bullshit. Bullshit! You've...

1310
01:36:23,114 --> 01:36:26,554
- What the hell happened here?
- He got a little frisky.

1311
01:36:28,057 --> 01:36:32,225
She's lying. She did something.
She left. Where's the formula?

1312
01:36:34,235 --> 01:36:37,766
Ned, I swear she wasn't here.
She's up to something.

1313
01:36:37,844 --> 01:36:41,145
All right.
The guys upstairs must have called it in.

1314
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:45,122
Opsec has people on the way already.
We're fried.

1315
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:46,783
They're gonna go over every inch of it.

1316
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:51,529
You're missing it, Ned! She wasn't here!
She's playing you! She's lying!

1317
01:36:51,636 --> 01:36:55,372
God damn it, Ned,
that's exactly what she wants! Ned!

1318
01:37:02,323 --> 01:37:06,024
Yeah. No. I got it right here. I got it...
It's in my hand.

1319
01:37:06,466 --> 01:37:08,662
Yes, yes, I am looking at it.

1320
01:37:09,671 --> 01:37:11,073
No, it's just... It's just a party.

1321
01:37:11,175 --> 01:37:14,670
We're having a little party
and blowing off some steam.

1322
01:37:15,317 --> 01:37:18,811
I... I mean, I have no idea what it says,
but then, I didn't take chemistry.

1323
01:37:19,492 --> 01:37:21,426
Where are you now?
Where are you right now?

1324
01:37:21,528 --> 01:37:25,867
You're not near a window or anything,
are you? All right. Good. Go, go!

1325
01:37:26,371 --> 01:37:30,277
Listen to me, Duke. I am counting on you.
I am counting on you big time.

1326
01:37:30,378 --> 01:37:33,077
Nobody sees this thing.
You hear me? Nobody.

1327
01:37:33,185 --> 01:37:36,453
Now you keep that formula wrapped in
Kryptonite until I get back tomorrow night.

1328
01:37:36,692 --> 01:37:39,425
Yep. Got it. Okay. Yep.

1329
01:37:44,873 --> 01:37:46,307
Yep!

1330
01:37:48,747 --> 01:37:51,948
Here's the money!
Welcome back.

1331
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:58,260
Fantastic! Time to celebrate.

1332
01:38:00,237 --> 01:38:03,333
- You okay?
- No. I'm burned.

1333
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:09,484
- You burned me. You let him burn me.
- What are you talking about? We got it.

1334
01:38:09,855 --> 01:38:13,193
I left a trail back there a mile wide.
I'm lucky I made it out of the building.

1335
01:38:13,296 --> 01:38:16,028
I can't go back to work,
I can't go back home. I'm totally burned.

1336
01:38:16,135 --> 01:38:18,970
- Whoa! Wait a minute.
- Don't you dare!

1337
01:38:19,041 --> 01:38:23,505
- So what do you need, Claire?
- What do I need? How about a new identity?

1338
01:38:23,617 --> 01:38:25,551
- Duke...
- Stow it, Ray!

1339
01:38:25,654 --> 01:38:29,717
I'm gonna go underground. I will tell you
where you can send my pay and my bonus,

1340
01:38:29,828 --> 01:38:33,393
which better be more than I expected
because this was a nightmare.

1341
01:38:33,502 --> 01:38:36,804
- What is your problem?
- A copy machine?

1342
01:38:37,409 --> 01:38:39,140
He had me running
all over that goddamn building

1343
01:38:39,212 --> 01:38:40,681
looking for a copy machine.

1344
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:44,018
- It worked, didn't it?
- Why didn't I just fax it?

1345
01:38:44,557 --> 01:38:46,390
Why? Because...

1346
01:38:46,994 --> 01:38:48,760
Tell her.
We had these machines all over the place.

1347
01:38:48,865 --> 01:38:50,163
Who the hell faxes anything anymore?

1348
01:38:50,234 --> 01:38:53,332
I am running around thinking, " What the hell
does this guy have me doing?"

1349
01:38:53,408 --> 01:38:56,710
- We had to get it out of there.
- There were 50 easier ways to do it!

1350
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:59,685
- Did it work or not?
- For who? For you?

1351
01:39:02,358 --> 01:39:05,261
Was anybody with him
when he got the formula?

1352
01:39:06,565 --> 01:39:08,867
Has he ever been alone with it?

1353
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,242
Could he have possibly made a copy of it?

1354
01:39:15,384 --> 01:39:18,652
- What the hell are you doing?
- I guess that's a no.

1355
01:39:19,123 --> 01:39:21,493
You're sick. She's sick.

1356
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:23,264
Look, I know this guy, okay?

1357
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:24,926
I should've told you that before,
but I couldn't

1358
01:39:25,002 --> 01:39:26,265
because he threatened the entire project.

1359
01:39:26,337 --> 01:39:28,239
He knows. He knows the whole thing.

1360
01:39:28,309 --> 01:39:30,471
No. He's right, Claire. I do.
I mean, I know that you two...

1361
01:39:30,579 --> 01:39:33,016
Do you know
he was on a CIA observation watch list?

1362
01:39:33,118 --> 01:39:34,985
That is total bullshit.

1363
01:39:36,024 --> 01:39:38,587
How'd he get on this project, anyway?

1364
01:39:38,662 --> 01:39:41,099
We're here for what, a year and a half?

1365
01:39:41,167 --> 01:39:43,136
How does he show up
three weeks before the payday?

1366
01:39:43,204 --> 01:39:46,506
- I just brought this home.
- What kind of watch list?

1367
01:39:47,378 --> 01:39:49,815
- You know what? No, forget it.
- No.

1368
01:39:49,885 --> 01:39:52,354
- I'm done here.
- Come on. Claire, wait!

1369
01:39:52,456 --> 01:39:54,358
You got what you wanted, Duke.

1370
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:56,362
You just better make sure
you're the only one

1371
01:39:56,463 --> 01:39:58,399
who got what you wanted.

1372
01:40:03,077 --> 01:40:06,710
I don't believe that. That's unbelievable.

1373
01:40:10,926 --> 01:40:14,694
Well, you said it yourself.
You left her out there too long.

1374
01:40:16,569 --> 01:40:17,595
Pam?

1375
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:22,875
Dinesh?

1376
01:40:25,587 --> 01:40:28,217
- It's possible.
- Guys, this is insane.

1377
01:40:28,926 --> 01:40:32,057
You bring me in to land the big fish,
I deliver, and this is the thanks I get.

1378
01:40:32,134 --> 01:40:35,072
This is the victory lap. What are you doing?

1379
01:40:35,908 --> 01:40:38,777
- You're gonna search me?
- Yeah. It takes five minutes.

1380
01:40:38,845 --> 01:40:42,307
- Because of that? Because of her?
- Does it matter?

1381
01:41:00,855 --> 01:41:01,948
Duke.

1382
01:41:10,475 --> 01:41:12,206
Ain't that a bitch.

1383
01:41:27,876 --> 01:41:29,538
<i></i>

1384
01:42:09,756 --> 01:42:13,320
- Mr. Garsik, welcome to San Diego.
- Yeah. It's great to be here.

1385
01:42:31,231 --> 01:42:32,667
Remember me?

1386
01:42:38,712 --> 01:42:41,184
- I guess Duke bought it.
- Oh, yeah.

1387
01:42:44,324 --> 01:42:46,386
- I waited.
- I see that.

1388
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:52,698
The Swiss buyers are waiting.
I got them to $35 million.

1389
01:42:54,176 --> 01:42:57,742
$17.5 split? Works for me.

1390
01:42:59,753 --> 01:43:02,725
- So tell me you have the formula.
- I thought you had it.

1391
01:43:02,793 --> 01:43:06,289
- I asked you first.
- You asked me first?

1392
01:43:11,912 --> 01:43:15,442
If I told you I loved you,
would it make any difference?

1393
01:43:17,221 --> 01:43:19,784
If you told me or if I believed you?

1394
01:43:25,305 --> 01:43:26,671
I love you.

1395
01:43:28,344 --> 01:43:29,778
I really do.

1396
01:43:32,586 --> 01:43:33,814
I don't know why you would believe me.

1397
01:43:33,921 --> 01:43:36,984
I don't know why
we'd believe anything anymore.

1398
01:43:38,664 --> 01:43:44,369
I just keep having this fantasy
that we suddenly snap out of it,

1399
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:50,385
that we come out of this
and be like people are supposed to be,

1400
01:43:50,487 --> 01:43:52,514
like, trusting and honest.

1401
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:56,997
- We're not like other people.
- I know that. Don't you think I know that?

1402
01:43:59,537 --> 01:44:01,404
Do you have any idea how frustrating it is

1403
01:44:01,507 --> 01:44:05,972
to know that you are the only man
who could ever possibly understand me?

1404
01:44:10,893 --> 01:44:12,886
Look, I know who you are.

1405
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,266
And I love you anyway.

1406
01:44:20,511 --> 01:44:22,675
If I find out this is
because you don't have the formula

1407
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:26,587
and you think maybe I do,
I'm gonna be seriously disappointed.

1408
01:44:26,858 --> 01:44:27,951
Okay.

1409
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:32,059
Okay, look. What about this?

1410
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:36,731
On the count of three,
whatever we've got, formula, no formula,

1411
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:38,439
let's just put it on the table,

1412
01:44:38,547 --> 01:44:40,949
- one time, last time...
- I have it.

1413
01:44:43,623 --> 01:44:44,957
I said on the count of three.

1414
01:44:45,027 --> 01:44:48,261
I have it. Why wait? What's the point?
I love you.

1415
01:44:49,636 --> 01:44:51,935
I think about you all the time.

1416
01:44:55,447 --> 01:44:58,350
I think about you even when you're with me.

1417
01:45:01,358 --> 01:45:05,389
I look at you, I can't stop looking at you.

1418
01:45:08,005 --> 01:45:11,636
I look at you and I think, " That woman...

1419
01:45:16,988 --> 01:45:20,051
"That woman knows who I am
and loves me anyway."

1420
01:45:25,706 --> 01:45:27,231
I have it, too.

1421
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:34,279
<i>RICHARD: It's a big room.</i>

1422
01:45:34,489 --> 01:45:37,394
You get a big room, you don't fill it,
it's gonna look like shit.

1423
01:45:37,462 --> 01:45:39,626
- Hey? That was a question.
- Sorry.

1424
01:45:39,734 --> 01:45:40,895
- What's going on in there?
- The room?

1425
01:45:40,969 --> 01:45:43,234
- Yeah.
- It's full. They were lined up an hour ago.

1426
01:45:43,306 --> 01:45:45,402
These satellite people
better know what the hell they're doing.

1427
01:45:45,478 --> 01:45:47,470
- They know what they're doing, right?
- The uplink? It's all set.

1428
01:45:47,582 --> 01:45:49,916
'Cause I'm not stalling for them
while they get their act together.

1429
01:45:49,987 --> 01:45:52,115
- We're right on schedule.
- Will you stop?

1430
01:45:52,225 --> 01:45:54,922
I'm beautiful, okay? Enough. Thank you.

1431
01:45:56,966 --> 01:45:59,233

What are you looking at?

1451
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:41,113
<i>But, you know, most of all,</i>

1452
01:48:41,188 --> 01:48:44,752
<i>I think you all know</i>
<i>how much I hate rushing into things.</i>

1453
01:48:48,434 --> 01:48:50,701
<i>RICHARD: Now, folks, for the past few years,</i>

1454
01:48:50,805 --> 01:48:54,837
<i>we have had a highly secret,</i>
<i>special research unit</i>

1455
01:48:54,948 --> 01:48:59,320
<i>that has been working on something</i>
<i>that we like to call Project Samson.</i>

1456
01:49:01,961 --> 01:49:04,488
<i>But you know</i>
<i>what these scientists are like, right?</i>

1457
01:49:04,565 --> 01:49:07,002
<i>They're all over me.</i>
<i>They're like, "Please, Dick,</i>

1458
01:49:07,070 --> 01:49:08,972
<i>"slow down, be patient, be careful.</i>

1459
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:13,506
<i>"Dick! Dick, please, we haven't published</i>
<i>our results yet. Dick!"</i>

1460
01:49:14,085 --> 01:49:16,078
<i>I say to hell with that!</i>

1461
01:49:19,862 --> 01:49:24,429
<i>No. I say...
I say to hell with hiding our light</i>
<i>under a basket.</i>

1462
01:49:24,538 --> 01:49:26,269
<i>I say, "You know what, guys?</i>

1463
01:49:26,376 --> 01:49:29,905
<i>"I'm meeting with my shareholders</i>
<i>and these people have got a right to know</i>

1464
01:49:30,015 --> 01:49:34,217
<i>"the incredible future</i>
<i>that we have got planned for this company!"</i>

1465
01:49:36,295 --> 01:49:37,456
<i>RICHARD: Yeah!</i>

1466
01:49:38,565 --> 01:49:39,795
<i>Come on!</i>

1467
01:49:44,543 --> 01:49:50,750
<i>Now, folks, I'm here today to announce</i>
<i>that we are in the final testing stages</i>

1468
01:49:51,891 --> 01:49:57,266
<i>of a safe, over-the-counter,</i>
<i>home-use shampoo product,</i>

1469
01:49:58,905 --> 01:50:04,850
<i>a product that can restore life</i>
<i>to formerly dead hair follicles.</i>

1470
01:50:08,757 --> 01:50:11,594
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, shareholders, yes!</i>

1471
01:50:11,930 --> 01:50:17,465
<i>Equikrom is in the home stretch</i>
<i>on a cure for baldness!</i>

1472
01:50:22,051 --> 01:50:23,382
<i>We got it.</i>

1473
01:50:24,555 --> 01:50:26,525
<i>RICHARD: That's right, we got it!</i>

1474
01:50:28,663 --> 01:50:29,722
<i>You!</i>

1475
01:50:31,536 --> 01:50:34,234
<i>You're gonna need it, pal! Look at you!</i>

1476
01:50:36,345 --> 01:50:42,186
Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick!
- Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick!

1477
01:51:03,597 --> 01:51:05,328
Is there a problem?

1478
01:51:08,574 --> 01:51:10,841
- Are you testing us?
- Excuse me?

1479
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:15,275
- Or perhaps you think this is a joke.
- I don't understand.

1480
01:51:15,354 --> 01:51:17,118
Yes, apparently not.

1481
01:51:19,796 --> 01:51:22,927
This formula is nothing
but a common skin cream.

1482
01:51:26,676 --> 01:51:28,305
Sorry, a lotion.

1483
01:51:49,822 --> 01:51:52,315
I'm so sorry. I just...
Just what?

1484
01:51:53,829 --> 01:51:56,163
I'm drawing a blank.
Nice try.

1485
01:51:57,938 --> 01:52:01,206
A little professional courtesy
would make this a lot less awkward.

1486
01:52:01,277 --> 01:52:03,542
How do I know you?
How do you know me?

1487
01:52:03,614 --> 01:52:04,742
Wow, that's a strong play.

1488
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:07,048
Believe me, I've spent a lot of time thinking
what this would be like,

1489
01:52:07,122 --> 01:52:10,253
where we'd be, what I'd say, what you'd say.

1490
01:52:10,362 --> 01:52:12,923
But I never...

1491
01:52:13,969 --> 01:52:16,770
You can cut me off there any time you like.

1492
01:52:16,875 --> 01:52:19,470
- Sorry. I spaced out.
- Okay. So?

1493
01:52:20,213 --> 01:52:23,050
- You wanna start over?
- No, no. Just go from there.

1494
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:26,489
- Can I have a sip of that?
- Go.

1495
01:52:27,429 --> 01:52:29,661
You clearly have me confused
with someone else.

1496
01:52:29,765 --> 01:52:32,670
I don't know. I mean, I'm not great on names.
I should be. I try.

1497
01:52:32,771 --> 01:52:36,108
Faces, I'm definitely better.
Faces, I'm like a B, B minus.

1498
01:52:36,179 --> 01:52:40,279
Where I'm good, people I've screwed.
That's a real area of strength for me.

1499
01:52:40,353 --> 01:52:41,753
Wrong.

1500
01:52:41,823 --> 01:52:44,989
- That was perfect.
- It's "people I've slept with."

1501
01:52:45,764 --> 01:52:48,099
- And I like "traditional."
- What do you mean?

1502
01:52:48,168 --> 01:52:50,469
"That's been a traditional area of strength
for me."

1503
01:52:50,539 --> 01:52:54,001
People I've slept with. That's been
a traditional area of strength for me.

1504
01:52:54,113 --> 01:52:55,777
That's nicer.

1505
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:57,444
Look, seriously,
I don't know who you think I am, but...

1506
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,618
- You're gonna enunciate, right?
- What?

1507
01:53:00,694 --> 01:53:02,890
You've gotta really speak up.

1508
01:53:03,664 --> 01:53:05,567
So you're, like, directing me now?

1509
01:53:05,668 --> 01:53:08,903
You wanna go out there tomorrow
and have them not hear it?

1510
01:53:09,010 --> 01:53:10,204
You are directing me.

1511
01:53:10,311 --> 01:53:13,546
No, I'm just filling a gap
in the chain of command.

1512
01:53:14,185 --> 01:53:16,680
Well, come back here and say that.

1513
01:53:16,757 --> 01:53:20,858
Claire, come on. We're doing this for real
in less than 12 hours.

1514
01:53:20,932 --> 01:53:24,872
I know. It's just this whole thing
makes me think about Rome,

1515
01:53:25,574 --> 01:53:27,841
and when I think about Rome,
I think about you and...

1516
01:53:27,913 --> 01:53:29,006
Let's just do it one more time.

1517
01:53:29,082 --> 01:53:32,520
when I think about you,
I can barely enunciate.

1518
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:37,060
- One more time without the robe.
I don't work naked.

1519
01:53:37,698 --> 01:53:39,895
You know I know it.
So show me.

1520
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:41,599
You show me.

1521
01:53:41,739 --> 01:53:44,404
Look,
let's just do it all the way through.

1522
01:53:44,478 --> 01:53:47,644
<i>RAY O VER SPEAKER: From the top,</i>
<i>one more time, and then I'll take off the robe.</i>

1523
01:53:47,751 --> 01:53:51,155
<i>CLAIRE: If you love me,</i>
<i>you'll do it without the robe, now.</i>

1524
01:53:52,761 --> 01:53:55,789
<i>RAY: Okay. From the top. No robe.</i>

1525
01:53:57,604 --> 01:53:58,698
<i>RAY: Remember me?</i>

1526
01:53:58,806 --> 01:54:02,301
<i>CLAIRE: Sure. Of course. We...</i>
<i>RAY: Long time, huh?</i>

1527
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:05,113
<i>CLAIRE: Yes. I'm...</i>
<i>RAY: Gotcha.</i>

1528
01:54:06,956 --> 01:54:11,488
<i>CLAIRE: Look, I'm sorry. Really, I just...</i>
<i>RAY: Sorry. Sorry.</i>

1529
01:54:12,833 --> 01:54:15,030
<i>CLAIRE: </i>
<i>I'm just drawing a blank here.</i>

1530
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:17,871
<i>RAY: You're drawing what?</i>

1531
01:54:20,483 --> 01:54:21,814
<i>CLAIRE: Excuse me?</i>

1532
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:27,020
Perfect. They're perfect!

1533
01:54:27,662 --> 01:54:29,564
Does that mean we're a go, sir?

1534
01:54:29,667 --> 01:54:32,365
Or we could spend another year
looking for ways to bait this trap,

1535
01:54:32,439 --> 01:54:35,069
and we wouldn't come up
with anything even close.

1536
01:54:35,177 --> 01:54:38,344
They're perfect. What a way to walk this in.

1537
01:54:38,685 --> 01:54:41,782
I'm only asking.
We made sure she found the speech.

1538
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:45,458
<i>JEFF: The rough draft.</i>
<i>We let her find it this afternoon.</i>

1539
01:54:46,766 --> 01:54:49,738
But we could still stall a little bit
if we need to tighten things up.

1540
01:54:49,805 --> 01:54:51,399
Once it's activated, Howard, we're in.

1541
01:54:51,475 --> 01:54:53,274
It's gonna be impossible
to call back the troops.

1542
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:56,250
No. No, no, no, no.
We're not stalling anymore.

1543
01:54:56,319 --> 01:54:58,983
- So is this everything?
- Yes, sir.

1544
01:54:59,091 --> 01:55:02,826
So the speech... Here is your final copy.

1545
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:06,061
<i>HOWARD: the details,</i>
<i>the very existence of this project</i>

1546
01:55:06,137 --> 01:55:08,266
<i>must be so carefully protected.</i>

1547
01:55:08,341 --> 01:55:10,505
The rough draft that we prepped
with you last week is in play.

1548
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:12,342
<i>DALE: This is starting to look pretty good.</i>

1549
01:55:12,449 --> 01:55:14,613
<i>DUKE: I can't even tell them apart.</i>
<i>Which one is the new one?</i>

1550
01:55:14,688 --> 01:55:16,953
For the travel records,
the Dunwoody material,

1551
01:55:17,025 --> 01:55:20,931
we've logged
about 200 false-flag travel orders.

1552
01:55:21,368 --> 01:55:24,498
<i>Formavale? Damned if I know.</i>
<i>Some kind of biotech.</i>

1553
01:55:24,975 --> 01:55:29,882
Cars, planes, hotels, everything.
Then we buried them in the actual files.

1554
01:55:30,217 --> 01:55:33,122
- And when they start digging?
- They find Ronnie.

1555
01:55:33,190 --> 01:55:35,787
Yes. And there's a plane waiting
to take me back to the Bahamas

1556
01:55:35,862 --> 01:55:37,023
once we're done here tonight.

1557
01:55:40,471 --> 01:55:42,373
This is my high school yearbook.

1558
01:55:43,243 --> 01:55:45,042
And the transcripts.

1559
01:55:45,146 --> 01:55:46,639
<i>RICHARD: You gotta stop waltzing around,</i>

1560
01:55:46,716 --> 01:55:48,845
<i>and you have got to get on this guy.</i>

1561
01:55:48,921 --> 01:55:51,688
So we take Ronnie's reality
until two years ago

1562
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,319
and we lay in our story on top.

1563
01:55:53,396 --> 01:55:54,557
<i>PHYSEC 1: We started turning on the lights.</i>

1564
01:55:54,666 --> 01:55:56,828
<i>We heard some scurrying around,</i>
<i>we had a little foot race.</i>

1565
01:55:56,903 --> 01:55:58,565
<i>It took a couple of minutes,</i>
<i>but we found him down here</i>

1566
01:55:58,673 --> 01:55:59,698
<i>hiding under the desk.</i>

1567
01:56:00,042 --> 01:56:01,101
The trips to Dunwoody,

1568
01:56:01,212 --> 01:56:03,706
the background
on the Formavale acquisitions,

1569
01:56:03,783 --> 01:56:07,381
the midnight load-outs,
it's all in place and ready to go.

1570
01:56:08,894 --> 01:56:12,423
Great work. Inspiring. Incredible.

1571
01:56:14,438 --> 01:56:17,274
This is more fun than if we really had it.

1572
01:56:17,711 --> 01:56:20,409
Ten days, that's the deadline.

1573
01:56:20,483 --> 01:56:23,454
Garsik has his shareholder meeting
in 10 days.

1574
01:56:24,457 --> 01:56:27,155
Light the fuse. Put it in play.

1575
01:56:34,609 --> 01:56:37,309
Don't.
Don't what?

1576
01:56:37,917 --> 01:56:40,820
Don't say it.
Say what?

1577
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:43,688
I know what you're thinking.

1578
01:56:43,795 --> 01:56:46,823
You're wondering
if I gave you a bogus formula.

1579
01:56:47,335 --> 01:56:51,469
You're thinking maybe I've got the real one
stashed someplace else.

1580
01:56:51,542 --> 01:56:54,275
That's sick, even for you.

1581
01:56:55,117 --> 01:56:57,109
But it crossed your mind.

1582
01:56:57,689 --> 01:57:01,685
- That's why I get the big bucks.
- Because I would never do that.

1583
01:57:03,131 --> 01:57:06,697
- Because you love me.
- Exactly.

1584
01:57:12,752 --> 01:57:16,485
Mr. Koval and Miss Stenwick?

1585
01:57:28,615 --> 01:57:29,878
Read it.

1586
01:57:35,462 --> 01:57:36,690
Read it.

1587
01:57:37,967 --> 01:57:40,199
"Compliments of Howard Tully."

1588
01:58:22,287 --> 01:58:26,853
- We got totally played, didn't we?
- Yep.

1589
01:58:28,666 --> 01:58:31,329
Must go pretty far back.

1590
01:58:32,975 --> 01:58:34,671
- Like...
- Way back.

1591
01:58:38,519 --> 01:58:41,046
I guess on a strictly professional level, it's...

1592
01:58:41,158 --> 01:58:42,524
Impressive.

1593
01:58:43,228 --> 01:58:44,855
- I mean...
- Yeah.

1594
01:58:55,685 --> 01:58:57,780
At least we have each other.

1595
01:58:58,457 --> 01:59:02,125
- It really is that bad, isn't it?
- Kind of, yeah.

1596
01:59:02,532 --> 01:59:04,559
- I didn't mean...
- I know.

1597
01:59:08,610 --> 01:59:11,777
- I can't breathe.
- You'll be okay.

1598
01:59:12,752 --> 01:59:16,783
- When?
- After we wake up in Rome.

1599
01:59:19,332 --> 01:59:23,601
I might have to wake up in Rome
for a long time.

1600
01:59:25,844 --> 01:59:27,574
Sounds like a plan.

1601
01:59:39,546 --> 01:59:46,046
THE END
