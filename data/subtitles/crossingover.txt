1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,760
Let's go, let's go.

2
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,320
Ready for them?

3
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,360
Rosie, open up.

4
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,920
<i>Vamos. Afuera. Vamos.</i>

5
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,800
Okay, let's go.

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,120
- Just give me five.
- What?

7
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,880
What do you want me to do?

8
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,280
Look, it's not my problem.

9
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
All I'm asking, Stevens,

10
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,600
is did the old man get seen to?

11
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
He was sweating and shaking
when I put him on the bus.

12
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,640
He said his arm felt numb.

13
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
Jesus Christ, Brogan.

14
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,880
Everything is
a humanitarian crisis with you.

15
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,040
You signed off on more
orders of recognizance

16
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,320
than the rest of your unit combined.

17
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Don't give me that shit.

18
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,800
The man's about to have
a goddamn heart attack.

19
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,600
I want him seen to.

20
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,040
Here he is.

21
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,960
Your guy was given
a clean bill of health by Doc Sturgess.

22
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,160
He bused out three hours ago.
You happy now?

23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,760
Yeah, I'm happy now.

24
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,800
Hey, Max, you're coming
on Wednesday, right?

25
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,400
For my dad's nationalization party?

26
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,400
Max, it's an important thing
in my culture

27
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,720
to make my father proud.

28
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,480
You know they've been
wanting to meet you.

29
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,480
I give you my word,
they're not as scary

30
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,600
as I made them out to be, okay?

31
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,880
You better do it before
they blow the lunch whistle.

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,400
All right, let's go, compadres. Let's do it.

33
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,600
Get down!

34
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,960
- Over there.
- I got it. Sorry.

35
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,120
Where did you buy this?
Alvarado Street?

36
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,320
Sorry, my friend. Let's go.

37
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,960
What you waiting for, Brogan?

38
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,160
A marriage proposal?

39
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,720
Come on.

40
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
Hey, hey! Gene.

41
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,480
Sir... There is no one to take care of my son.

42
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:28,480
I got her. Thanks.

43
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,280
I must give you his information.

44
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,760
He is upstairs with the neighbor.
- It's not possible.

45
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,960
If she doesn't get her money today,
she'll put him out on the street.

46
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,840
I can't.

47
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,400
Sorry, señora. I can't.

48
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,640
Apartment 21.
- It's not possible.

49
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,960
No, no, no.

50
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,160
<i>No es posible.</i>

51
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
Please help me.

52
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,960
<i>Muy bonita. You get her number?</i>

53
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,720
I smell an O.R.

54
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,520
Yeah, he's always giving
the pretty ones a pass,

55
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,840
sometimes even
the not-so-pretty ones.

56
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,520
- Oh!
- Okay?

57
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,880
Now knock it the fuck off.

58
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,920
Okay, everybody say,
"Thank you, Mr. Kossef,

59
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,840
for singing that beautiful song. "

60
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,400
Thank you, Mr. Kossef.

61
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,760
You know, that was actually
a pretty tough crowd.

62
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,200
Yeah.

63
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,280
Well, was I shit?

64
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,240
No, actually.

65
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,640
No, and for somebody
who just learned the song last night,

66
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,240
- I thought you did a very good job.
- Oh, good.

67
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:20,080
'Cause I had absolutely no idea

68
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,200
- what I was singing about.
- Yeah.

69
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,600
- Oh, you could tell?
- Yeah, and also,

70
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,920
please don't take this the wrong way,

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,800
but what kind of Jew gets
hired at a Jewish day school

72
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,800
who doesn't speak any Hebrew

73
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,320
or even really, like, know
the first thing about Judaism?

74
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,760
Well, I guess, the atheist kind.

75
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,120
Excuse me?

76
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,400
No, I'm sorry.

77
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,120
It's just... I just needed a job.

78
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,800
And it was actually my manager's mom

79
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,880
- is the principal of the school.
- Ah.

80
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,760
- You didn't completely suck.
- Oh, thank you.

81
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,960
I do not want you to say
a word about this to anyone.

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
I mean anyone.

83
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,800
It could be very serious
trouble for the school,

84
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,320
- and for me.
- No, I'm not gonna say anything.

85
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,600
I want you to know

86
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,640
I am only doing this
because of my son,

87
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,120
because he says to me, "Mom, Gavin
is going to be an important musician. "

88
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,040
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

89
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,680
Otherwise, I wouldn't do anything like this.

90
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,920
Well, thank you. Thank you, Rachel.

91
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,280
Honestly, I can't thank you enough.

92
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,000
She'll be right along, ma'am.

93
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,520
Thank you.

94
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
Oh.

95
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,880
Mmm. Mmm.

96
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,240
Hold on just a second.

97
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,640
Would you like to draw?

98
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,040
Here you go, honey.

99
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,240
I have something else
for you this week, too.

100
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,280
Your teacher, Madame Ntende,

101
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,960
sent this to me in the mail.

102
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,160
She said that you lost it
right before you left

103
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,080
and that you were really sad.

104
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,280
And she found it a few weeks ago.

105
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Honey, it's gonna be
a little while longer,

106
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,560
and we are working very hard
to find you a good mommy.

107
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,000
She won't ever replace
your real mommy,

108
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
but she will love you.

109
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,840
And I promise that she'll never leave you.

110
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
The men
involved in this terrorist attack

111
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,080
have been vilified,
demonized, and condemned

112
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
by the Western world.

113
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,560
But we never want to talk
about the 9/11 Jihadists as real people.

114
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,960
The media and our leaders
are quick to label them

115
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,000
as terrorists and monsters
and murderers.

116
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,960
But shouldn't we try
to understand them as human beings?

117
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,480
Fuck, no.

118
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,120
Everybody calls them cowards

119
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
for murdering helpless passengers

120
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,400
and causing the deaths
of thousands of innocent lives.

121
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
- What would you call them?
- Hey.

122
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,600
It's the truth.

123
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,360
But cowards do not knowingly
sacrifice themselves

124
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,160
for a greater cause.

125
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,120
- I don't agree at all.
- The cause is to kill us?

126
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,840
You may not agree with their cause...

127
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
I don't understand why she's up there.

128
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,600
But I do not believe their actions

129
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,320
were either cowardly or irrational.

130
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,360
You know you don't want
to hear this shit, Ms. B.

131
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,080
She's talking.

132
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,000
I feel that, like the oppressed
Palestinian people,

133
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,880
or the Iraqi citizens

134
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,400
under occupation
in their own homeland,

135
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,920
that they found themselves without a voice.

136
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:34,320
Hey.

137
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,840
And that the only way for them to be heard

138
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,960
is to scream with the might of tons of steel

139
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,760
and thunderous jet engines
behind them upon impact.

140
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,480
Okay, okay.

141
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,320
Their voices were heard.

142
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,720
You may not like what they had to say

143
00:11:50,755 --> 00:11:53,057
or how they got their message across,

144
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:55,360
but for the first time, we heard it.

145
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,120
We gotta listen to this shit?

146
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,280
- What we heard was a cry for justice.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

147
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,640
Okay, okay. Yes, thank you.

148
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,360
Hey, Ms. B., thank you.

149
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,680
I am... I am not sure

150
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,680
that that was the point
of the assignment, Taslima,

151
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,320
but, uh, yes, it was
certainly thought-provoking.

152
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,160
- Bullshit.
- Yeah, bullshit.

153
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
You can sit down now.

154
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,440
College is hungry for her.

155
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,800
Fucking traitor.

156
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,320
Crybaby.

157
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,840
Why don't you get
the fuck out of our country

158
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,760
and go back to camel-humping
Saudi Arabia,

159
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,480
- where the fuck you camel-humpers live.
- Brian. Brian.

160
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,920
I know you're upset,

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,480
but I'm not going to condone
an outburst like that.

162
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
Yo, what's your name? Taslima bin Laden?

163
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,760
Hey, yo, I just got one question, Ms. B.

164
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,280
Did you frisk her? What if the bitch

165
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,800
be strapped with dynamite
or TNT or something?

166
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,520
She going to get a grenade!

167
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,520
- Yo, take us all out.
- Boom!

168
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,680
Marcus!

169
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,800
Sure, I'm up for that.

170
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,640
Oh, shit, it's my brother.

171
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,960
Hey.

172
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,600
I thought I told you not to come.

173
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,440
Javier's giving me a ride home.

174
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,080
It's on my way.

175
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,440
I just need five minutes to finish up.

176
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,040
I'm in the middle of an order.

177
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,960
Look at you. Cover yourself up.

178
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,840
Just go.

179
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,880
I'll meet you in the car.

180
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,320
Please.

181
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,080
- Um, Heavy-eye?
- Javier.

182
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,600
Hi, I'm Claire.
We spoke on the phone, remember?

183
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,200
Right. Yeah.

184
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,720
Okay.

185
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,080
Is that okay?

186
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,800
Yeah, it's good.
Come back on Friday.

187
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,160
Friday. Is that the soonest?

188
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,560
Yeah.

189
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,960
Okay. See you Friday. Okay.

190
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,560
Yong, take out the garbage please.

191
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,160
It's Seung's turn.

192
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,600
I did it yesterday.

193
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,400
He's lying. I did it last night.

194
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,040
Oh, mama's boy taking out garbage.

195
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:42,360
Who made you the bitch of the family?

196
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,000
- You got no sister to do your grunt work?
- We take turn.

197
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,840
You gotta keep that shit
under control, motherfucker.

198
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,000
Tomo. Let's hit it.

199
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,320
Where to?

200
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,240
Damn.

201
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,160
Oh, shit, I got this little Glock, homie.

202
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,400
Okay, check it out.
Wan's uncle's into him for 50 large.

203
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,840
Pays out on Saturdays,
gets the cash in the store

204
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,720
Friday night right before closing.

205
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,520
We're gonna roll by and scope it out.

206
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,920
Yeah, you the bitch.

207
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,680
Give Yong the Ruger. Sweet gat, yo.

208
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,840
Tell me this don't make
your little chachi hard.

209
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
- Pussy.
- Yong, you're gonna pop your cherry, fool.

210
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
- That's right.
- You up for that, Yong?

211
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,560
Better be, homie.

212
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,520
<i>By sunbathing,
crocodiles accelerate</i>

213
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,880
<i>the chemical reactions in their bodies.</i>

214
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,120
<i>Once the croc is up to speed...</i>

215
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,400
No, I don't know her name.

216
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,120
I'll recognize her when I see her.

217
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,880
Yes. Andasol Fabrics.

218
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm gonna come down
and have her released on an O.R.

219
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,200
She's got a minor child left unattended.

220
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,320
Are you sure?

221
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,080
How long ago did they bus out?

222
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,520
Wait, wait, wait.

223
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,200
Did anybody from
Children's Services see her?

224
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,040
Yeah. Okay.

225
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,480
Thank you.

226
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,480
Fuck it.

227
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,880
#... in a man with angry rules #

228
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,800
# It's that bitter pill can make you kill #

229
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,800
# It don't put me in the mood #

230
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,160
# So don't talk to yourself #

231
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,200
# But don't talk to me #

232
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,080
# There's a river running through it #

233
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,880
# The devil's not my enemy #

234
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,840
# So don't talk to yourself #

235
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,600
# But don't talk to me #

236
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,160
# If there's poison in the maker #

237
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,760

# Enemy #

239
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,440
Whoo!

240
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,160
That was great.

241
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,160
Thank you. I'm done.

242
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,760
Glad you came.
So how was your class?

243
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,200
What?

244
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,200
<i>I got a recurring role on The D'Angelos.</i>

245
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,120
- You got a part? Are you serious?
- Bitch.

246
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,520
- You did? You got a part?
- I know, it's unbelievable.

247
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,920
Oh, fuck. That's a big deal, babe.
It's big news.

248
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,280
- Yeah.
- We should get a drink.

249
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,320
I'll get it.

250
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,960
Thanks, babe.

251
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,160
So how did you pull it off?

252
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,960
I don't know. The casting director
knows my situation.

253
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,880
She's given me until Friday
to get my I-9 in.

254
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
So there's a fellow I met
through someone at Crunch.

255
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,920
He works at one of those photocopying
stores on Fountain.

256
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,240
Come on, no, no, no.
You can't do that.

257
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,000
If you get caught
with a fake green card,

258
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,920
you could be done for fraud.

259
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
It's no different from photoshopping
your Social Security card

260
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,240
to remove the "Not
for Employment" stamp.

261
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,560
Or passing yourself off
as a religious Jew

262
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,160
when you're an atheist,
like, an actual atheist.

263
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,760
- Come home with me.
- What?

264
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,400
I'm serious. Come home with me.

265
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,080
It's not practical. You know that.

266
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,720
You know we can't make a go
of it without status.

267
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,720
I've gotta get legal, and so do you.

268
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,480
You've got to get legal.
You know that.

269
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,920
I'm working on that, all right?

270
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,680
I just want to know
where this guy is.

271
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,360
Your Captain America
who's gonna come down

272
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,680
he's gonna sweep you off your feet,

273
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,440
he's gonna marry you,
he's gonna make you legit.

274
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,160
- Isn't that what you're looking for?
- Captain America?

275
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,640
I just wonder what's taking you so long.

276
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
Here you go.

277
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,520
Thanks, babe.

278
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,560
Yeah, listen, I gotta go.

279
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,560
I gotta go. It was a real pleasure
meeting you...

280
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,200
- Rose.
- Rose.

281
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,080
Yeah, just give me an email
when your TV thing comes out.

282
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,760
Gavin, I'll see you...

283
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,160
before. You know?

284
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,360
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

285
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,760
Who is it?
- Immigration.

286
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,040
Who?
- Open the door.

287
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm looking for a boy.

288
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,520
Mireya Sanchez's son.

289
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,200
I don't know anything.
These are my sister's children, and mine.

290
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,880
I don't know anything.
- Don't fuck with me.

291
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,960
She owes me money for the week.

292
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,440
What are you doing,
negotiating with me?

293
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,280
Is that what you think you're doing?

294
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,480
How much?

295
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,600
$50.

296
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,520
If it's not the right kid, I'm coming back.

297
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,360
What's his name?

298
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,800
Juan.

299
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Juan Sanchez.

300
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,360
Go with him. Scram.

301
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,960
Thanks, pal.

302
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,360
The number you have reached is temporarily out of service.
- Please try again later.

303
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,120
I need a reverse I.D.
on a Tijuana number.

304
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,560
Let's see.

305
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,920
It is 661-555-7782.

306
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,920
Appreciate it.

307
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,120
Oh, I think it's this
goddamn stomach flu that's going around.

308
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,040
I've been throwing up all morning.

309
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,200
Well, let them know
I'll call in later tomorrow.

310
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,480
Okay, let's go.

311
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,800
Uh, I'm not finding any record
of your I-539 in our system.

312
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,720
You said you sent it in six weeks ago?

313
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,800
Eight. Eight weeks ago.

314
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,280
Okay. Well, do you
have a mailing receipt?

315
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,640
No, because I just copied
my I-94 and sent it by regular mail.

316
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,400
Okay, well, then how about a cancelled
check for the application fee?

317
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,640
Um, well, I paid by money order.

318
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:21,400
I don't have a checkbook.

319
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,405
I didn't get a receipt
for my money order.

320
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,480
Listen, I'm starting to get
a little concerned here...

321
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,880
Ma'am, you are not out of status

322
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,240
until you receive a decision
on your extension application.

323
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,720
However, if that application
is lost in the system

324
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,720
or for whatever reason
it doesn't get to us,

325
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,280
then how are we supposed to know

326
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,280
that you even sent it in in the first place?

327
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,360
From our perspective, with no mailing receipt
or cancelled money order,

328
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,700
you're out of status, unless...

329
00:23:44,735 --> 00:23:46,960
My application just turns up.

330
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,440
Son of a bitch.

331
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,400
Fuck. It's a brand-new fucking car.

332
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,760
Sorry, didn't I...

333
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,640
I didn't have time to stop.
You just shot out like that.

334
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,680
- I signaled, didn't I?
- No, and even if you did,

335
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,080
it's supposed to be clear
before you turn into the street.

336
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,000
You okay?

337
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,640
Yeah.

338
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,160
Yeah? You look dazed.

339
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,720
- No.
- Do you need to sit down?

340
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,840
Does it hurt anywhere?

341
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,840
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You sure?

342
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,360
Yeah, I'm all right, I think.

343
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,800
I've just had a really, really shitty day.

344
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,320
- Where you from, New Zealand?
- Australia.

345
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,720
It's always one or the other.

346
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,360
I can never quite tell the difference.

347
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,280
I said New Zealand to impress you
in case I was right.

348
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,400
Most people usually say Australia,

349
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,680
which upsets the Kiwis.

350
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,640
I don't have the money to pay for this.

351
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,520
I'm not insured on my car.

352
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,440
Ouch. That's not good.

353
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,320
I must have fucked someone over
really badly in a past life

354
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,360
because shit is just
piling up for me today.

355
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
I just spent the last
three hours in there

356
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,280
trying to convince some bureaucratic bitch

357
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,760
that I actually did file for an extension
on my visitor's visa.

358
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,280
Which I fucking did.

359
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,960
- What's your name?
- I'm sorry. I'm Claire Shepard.

360
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,120
Claire Shepard, I'm Cole Frankel,

361
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,600
- and I know of your frustrations.
- You do?

362
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm a supervisory center
adjudications officer.

363
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,800
What that means is I get to determine

364
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,120
whether a green card
application has merit or not.

365
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,200
Ah, that must be interesting.

366
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,160
Yeah, I'll tell you what's interesting,

367
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:27,080
and what's of a bit of concern to me,

368
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,080
aside from you not having insurance,

369
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,600
and that's someone who's filing
for an extension of their visitor's visa

370
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,400
driving around with a stack
of head shots in her car.

371
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,480
There's nothing wrong
with a beautiful woman like yourself

372
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,560
having head shots in her car
if you were back in Australia.

373
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,440
You're not authorized to be seeking
employment in the United States, Claire.

374
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,360
Am I wrong about that?

375
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,320
All right, here's what I propose.

376
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,640
We call AAA... my card, of course.

377
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,120
If you don't have insurance,
you sure as hell don't have AAA.

378
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,440
Then we get your vehicle sorted out.

379
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,720
Then we go grab some lunch together.

380
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,160
Excuse me?

381
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,440
I want to buy you lunch, Claire,
and explain your options to you.

382
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,720
or we could just take a walk
back into the building

383
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,360
and sort it out there.

384
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,920
Juanito! Juanito!

385
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,480
<i>Gracias, Señor.</i>

386
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,200
She tried to get back to L.A. last night?
- Yes, sir. She was very worried about him.

387
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,760
And you haven't heard from her?

388
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,000
She was supposed to call when she got across.

389
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,200
Sanchez. Mireya.

390
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,880
24.

391
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,200
It would be last night
or early this morning.

392
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,600
You positive?

393
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,080
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

394
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,280
That's a great show.

395
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,920
Nothing can touch that on TV.

396
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I thought you said you wanted
to discuss my situation.

397
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,240
All right.

398
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,640
Here's the thing, Claire.

399
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,760
You want to be an actress
like Nicole and Naomi, obviously.

400
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,640
You know as well as I do

401
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,600
the work they do in Australia
doesn't count for shit.

402
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,520
They're stars because they
make movies here in America.

403
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,680
If you were to get deported,
or even chose voluntary departure,

404
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,200
you ain't getting back into this country

405
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,240
for a minimum of ten years.

406
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,880
And with voluntary departure,
they say it's closer to five,

407
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,160
but the truth is, you're lucky
if you ever get back in.

408
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,600
What's your wife do?

409
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,040
She works for the other side.

410
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,400
She's an immigration defense attorney.

411
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,680
Oh. Is she available for a consult?

412
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,280
That's funny.

413
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,120
Sexy, great sense of humor.
You got it all, Claire.

414
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,960
Except for a work permit.

415
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,405
I don't think you'll feel so witty

416
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,040
when they introduce you
to a holding cell down in San Pedro.

417
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,880
Strip-search, the whole bit.

418
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,520
Some mama Latina makes you
her bitch for a couple nights.

419
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,320
All right. You've made your point.

420
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,880
So where would you like to do it?

421
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,320
You're goddamn amazing.

422
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,480
Whew.

423
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,280
You really are...

424
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,040
a perfect little fuck machine.

425
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,040
Without a green card.

426
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,040
Well, maybe we could
do something about that.

427
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,960
You can get me a green card?

428
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,680
I can't just manufacture one for you.

429
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,320
I'm not in the counterfeiting business.

430
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,480
But I can have your file and application,

431
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,560
which would conveniently
land on my desk,

432
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,600
and regardless of the merits
of that application,

433
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
it would be approved.

434
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,400
You could really pull that off?

435
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,600
Like, on what grounds?

436
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,960
You're a recognized TV star
in Australia, Claire.

437
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:39,040
I'm bloody well not. I'm not even close.

438
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,840
I don't know that.

439
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,120
And no one else does.

440
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,520
You fabricate some credits,

441
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,560
a few, uh, Aussie awards,

442
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,520
some bullshit testimonials.

443
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,240
And I make it fly.

444
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,560
It's called an EB-1.

445
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,160
It's a green card for persons
of extraordinary ability.

446
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,640
Are you jerking me around?

447
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,200
Or is this real?

448
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,120
Because if you can make
this happen for me...

449
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,280
You'd make it worth my while.

450
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,720
Mm-hmm.

451
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,920
For two weeks.

452
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,840
For a green card?

453
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,320
Six months, baby.

454
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,720
I don't think so.

455
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,440
One month.

456
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,120
Three months.

457
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,720
Two months

458
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,400
and you get me approved
up front, all right?

459
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,120
You can hold on to the paperwork,

460
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,160
but I want to see it.
I want to know that it's real.

461
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,680
Done.

462
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,920
But you're on the clock from tomorrow.

463
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,760
I call, and you get your ass over
to whatever address I give you.

464
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,360
All right.

465
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,640
So you through with me for the day?
Can I go grab a shower?

466
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,120
No, wait.

467
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,240
I got one more favor
to ask of you, Claire.

468
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,120
I want you down on all fours
at the edge of the bed.

469
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,480
You ain't got that yet?

470
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,680
- You cheated today.
- Check it out, yo.

471
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,120
Wait, wait, wait.

472
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,880
You gonna talk to her, dude?

473
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,680
- Taslima. Taslima!
- Oh, God.

474
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,240
It's the sand-nigger express.

475
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,000
Raghead chick can hide her face
and nobody even know she butt-ugly.

476
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
Hey, maybe you can get
your sister to convert or something, A.Z.

477
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,760
Shut up.

478
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,760
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff!

479
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,000
Put on your belt.

480
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,000
No.

481
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,720
Do you know that it will take another month

482
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,880
to get another appointment?

483
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,400
Immigration Customs Enforcement. Open
the door.

484
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,040
What is this about?

485
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,760
Federal agents.
Open the door, please.

486
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,400
We have a warrant.

487
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,840
Hands against the wall, please.

488
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,400
Hands against the wall.

489
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,920
What is this?

490
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,480
Why is the FBI here?

491
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,160
Relax, sir. Put your
hands behind your back.

492
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,320
Are you Taslima Jahangir?

493
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,520
I'm Special Agent Phadkar.

494
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,720
Will you show me
to your bedroom, please?

495
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,560
I don't understand what this is about.

496
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,200
Did you write this?

497
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,600
Why do you have it?

498
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,840
It was brought to our attention
by the principal of your school.

499
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,840
He was troubled by the position you took.

500
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,840
I thought there was something
like freedom of speech in this country.

501
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,800
You essay elicits sympathy
for the 9/11 hijackers,

502
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,320
suggests you feel their cause was just.

503
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,880
That's not what I wrote.

504
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,280
I wrote that I understand
why they did what they did.

505
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
I didn't write that I support it.

506
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,120
Do you? Support their actions?

507
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,840
I understand their need to be heard.

508
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
I don't think they went
about it in the right way.

509
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,800
Agent Phadkar.

510
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,520
Do you have an interest in suicide?

511
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,960
Your diary suggests you do.

512
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,800
That's not...

513
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,240
Those are notes on a class paper
on why religions oppose suicide.

514
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,640
And you're not opposed to it?

515
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,560
I wouldn't become a suicide bomber,
if that's what you mean.

516
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,000
But you condone suicide bombing

517
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,800
as a legitimate means
to make a statement?

518
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,240
That's what you wrote in your essay.

519
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,040
You're twisting my words.
That's not what I wrote.

520
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,360
Well, reads that way to me.

521
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,160
"Upon impact, their voices
were finally heard.

522
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
"You may not like what they had to say

523
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,800
"or how they got
their message across,

524
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,280
"but we heard it.
For the first time, we heard it. "

525
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,440
I was just saying that
they got our attention

526
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,640
and that maybe
we should understand

527
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,040
why they did what they did. That's all.

528
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,200
So if someone's pissed off at America,

529
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,640
they should hijack and fly planes
into our buildings.

530
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,280
That seems like
a reasonable thing to do.

531
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,280
Agent Phadkar, over here.

532
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,040
Take a look at this.

533
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,720
She has a World of Islam account.

534
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,800
She's been frequenting
some interesting chatrooms.

535
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,520
Global Jihad,

536
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,400
Jihad Talking Points.

537
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,800
I'm interested in all
Muslim points of view.

538
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,800
It keeps me informed.

539
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,320
Taslima, your parents are
in the United States illegally.

540
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:38,640
My brother and sister were born here.

541
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,000
They're American citizens.

542
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,160
True.

543
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,920
But you and your parents are not.

544
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,080
When your brother and sister
reach the age of 21,

545
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,560
they're entitled to petition
for your parents to enter this country.

546
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,840
Until then, your family has no status.

547
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,600
Listen to me, Taslima.

548
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,960
Here's what I'm willing to do for you.

549
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,400
I'm not interested
in detaining your family.

550
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,760
But I'd like to talk to you further.

551
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,160
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
has every right

552
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:09,240
to take your family into custody,

553
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,840
but if you leave with us now
and cooperate with us,

554
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,840
Immigration won't detain them.

555
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,680
They'll still have to resolve their status,

556
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,080
but nobody's looking to make
an issue of that right now.

557
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,280
You understand?

558
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,160
Mr. Max, welcome to my home.

559
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,040
- Thank you.
- You honor me with your presence tonight.

560
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:53,840
- Thank you.
- This is my wife.

561
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,400
Very nice to meet you. Welcome.

562
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,200
Thank you. You have a beautiful home.

563
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,600
Thank you.

564
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,560
Congratulations, sir, on your naturalization.

565
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,200
Thank you. Farid.

566
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,160
Come over here. Come and meet
an important gentleman.

567
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,480
- He's my youngest son. He's a lawyer.
- Ah.

568
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,480
- How are you?
- How do you do?

569
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,560
- It's a pleasure.
- Hi. How are you?

570
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,440
This is Max. He is the partner of Hamid.

571
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,120
You show him the respect,
or he will have you deported.

572
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,960
He can't deport me, Baba.
I've already been naturalized.

573
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,080
You're the only person in this house
who can be deported.

574
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,480
Until Saturday.
Then he becomes one of us.

575
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,480
I'm gonna go put her down.
It was good to meet you.

576
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,840
- Thank you.
- Okay, come on.

577
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,680
Hey, Max, I'm so glad
you made it tonight.

578
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,240
I really appreciate it.

579
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,960
Get you a drink?

580
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,280
Yeah, Scotch rocks, please.

581
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,720
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

582
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,480
Inside.

583
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,200
My sister should not
have come here tonight.

584
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,360
What's going on there?

585
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,640
She puts herself before the family.

586
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,560
She shouldn't expect
to be welcome around here.

587
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,760
Baba.

588
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,400
So, Max. Hamid speaks so highly of you.

589
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,720
He looks up to you.

590
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,480
Never understood why he joined the
immigration Gestapo.

591
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,840
I think that deep down inside

592
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,040
he doesn't feel like he belongs.

593
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,760
I mean, what better way
to prove you're red, white, and blue

594
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,720
than by throwing out those
who also don't belong?

595
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,480
You're a lawyer, huh?

596
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,680
I'm a junior partner
at Berkhof, Mazolo, and Klein.

597
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,240
Specialize in personal injury.

598
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,720
We have 35 lawyers under us.

599
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,960
You're an ambulance chaser.

600
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,860
I don't chase anyone.

601
00:38:45,895 --> 00:38:47,680
I turn clients away.

602
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,960
Excuse me.

603
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,800
You have another one of those?

604
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,320
Max Brogan. I work with Hamid.

605
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,960
I know who you are.

606
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,080
Thank you.

607
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,960
What does that say on your bracelet?

608
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,160
"Little angel. "

609
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,160
My father gave it to me when I was 12.

610
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,520
You realize that they're staring at us.

611
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,880
Very disapproving looks you're getting
for consorting with the outcast.

612
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,760
I'll risk it.

613
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,280
I've never been invited
to a shunning before.

614
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,680
What is this? Something you guys
brought over with you?

615
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,640
I didn't bring it.

616
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,480
I was born here.

617
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,560
I'm the only one in this family
who's an actual American.

618
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,800
Probably decided to naturalize.

619
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,200
Makes 'em every bit as American as you.

620
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,640
Let me tell you about my father.

621
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,720
The great American-to-be.

622
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,600
He was always critical of the Shah.

623
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,040
But after the revolution,

624
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,680
one of his business rivals spread rumors
that he was anti-Khomeini.

625
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,720
And the whole family
had to flee across the border to Turkey.

626
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,280
He spent most of his savings
trying to get everybody over here.

627
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,600
But see, he doesn't pine
for the days of the Shah.

628
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,160
And I think he'd be perfectly content

629
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,480
in that fucked-up Islamic shithole
that that country is today.

630
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,000
Which is why he resents
every day he spends here.

631
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,200
Well, he could go back.

632
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,000
He's too old to start over.

633
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,400
So what's your story?

634
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,960
Any family?

635
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,280
I have a daughter.

636
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,760
I'm not with her mother anymore.

637
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,760
How old is she?

638
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,040
26.

639
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,880
Uh... no.

640
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,880
27.

641
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,280
You better get that straight,
or you might piss her off.

642
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,280
I think I did that already.

643
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,360
Max, my father's asking for you.

644
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,040
It was nice meeting you, Max.

645
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,920
You, too.

646
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm out of here.

647
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,280
Got a date.

648
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,600
Got a real hot date, Max.

649
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,080
Ignore her. She's crazy.

650
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,240
I'm tired, Hamid.

651
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,160
I'm gonna go home.

652
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,160
Max.

653
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,360
My father.

654
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,000
See you tomorrow.

655
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,200
Tell your family thanks for me, okay?

656
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,680
You know what she said

657
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,600
to the Yoruban interpreter today?

658
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,600
"Are you my mommy?"

659
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,520
The interpreter says

660
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,120
she's losing her ability
to speak the language.

661
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,720
It's 23 months
that she's been in there.

662
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,400
23 fucking months.

663
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,160
I feel gutted every time I go.

664
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,800
Ah, it's a shitty situation.

665
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,280
But you can't keep
beating yourself up over it.

666
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,280
I was thinking...

667
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,880
we could maybe adopt her.

668
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,240
D.

669
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,680
I'm serious.

670
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,280
Her mother's dying of AIDS in a hospice.

671
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,600
Leike's dad
back in Nigeria denies paternity

672
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,320
and won't accept custody of her.

673
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,120
We're working on it. One of our own.

674
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,800
And we can keep working on it.

675
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,400
I've thought about this a lot.

676
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,080
And it feels right.

677
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,080
It feels like it's meant to be.

678
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,480
You can't just lay this
on me and expect me to...

679
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,200
God.

680
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,520
Will you think about it?

681
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,640
It's important to me.

682
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,360
Please.

683
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,960
Yeah, I'll think about it.

684
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,600
Thank you.

685
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,080
- I can't do this.
- Oh.

686
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,720
I haven't even spoken Hebrew
since my bar mitzvah, you know?

687
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,760
I didn't even know it then.

688
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,840
You know what?

689
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,640
You guys, you're all the same.

690
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,560
All of you. You're all reform at best.

691
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,160
Most of you haven't gone to Shul
since your bar mitzvahs.

692
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,440
But first thing you do when you come
over here is play the Jew card.

693
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,200
Haven't you got any shame?

694
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,000
Ouch. That's pretty...

695
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,200
Oh. Hello?

696
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,880
Hey, Mum. Hey, hey, hey.
How are you doing?

697
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,440
Yeah, did you get my message?

698
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,720
Uh-huh. Yeah.

699
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,720
Well, what about the rabbi?

700
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,280
No, I need you to
get him to write a letter

701
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,600
like on the Temple's letterhead

702
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,640
saying, uh, that I attend services regularly.

703
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,640
Uh, I was bar mitzvahed by him.

704
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,040
And that I'm, you know,

705
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,600
I'm strongly committed
to the Jewish faith.

706
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,800
All right.

707
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,280
Well, listen,
I'm kind of busy right now.

708
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,720
But I'll get back to you, though.

709
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,900
And will you do that for me?

710
00:44:34,935 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah, you promise? Okay.

711
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,000
Listen, M... Yeah.

712
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,080
I'll speak to you soon.

713
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,060
All right. I love you, too.

714
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,000
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye.

715
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,000
Ahh...

716
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,240
look, I... I got to be home by 10, yeah?

717
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,240
So, um...

718
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,125
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

719
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,880
- With everything.
- Thank you.

720
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,600
Oh, what about if I just
kind of twiddled these...

721
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,685
these side bits here?

722
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,800
You think I'd get away with that?

723
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,480
If I just stick these out like that?

724
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,200
I can go all night with my wife,

725
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
but I'm like a teenager with you.

726
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,160
Doesn't sound like you've gone all night
with her in a long while.

727
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,800
It used to be hot between us.

728
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,960
One day, you're just
not into it anymore.

729
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,480
It becomes like an effort.

730
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,640
Easier to jerk yourself off in the shower

731
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,680
than to rub her back for half an hour.

732
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,600
Bloody sad.

733
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah, it is.

734
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,400
Maybe I'll come watch you
on the set next week.

735
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,480
That's not part of the deal.

736
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,640
It's not supposed to be.

737
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
I just thought I'd stop by and...

738
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,840
Um, I got to go.

739
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,640
I've got a meeting with an agent.

740
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,840
If she signs me, it's major.

741
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,040
I'll call you tomorrow.

742
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,880
This is really lame.
I'll never wear this again.

743
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,160
You only become an American once, boy.

744
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,400
You should be old enough
to appreciate what it means.

745
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,000
I didn't ask to come over here.

746
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,280
We're just gooks to them.

747
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,040
This country has given us a life.

748
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,280
Stop acting like a peasant. We're past that.

749
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,320
You know how the rich got rich...
and earned respect in this place?

750
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,320
At the end of a gun.

751
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,960
You don't stand in line
to make it in this country.

752
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,320
You cut in and take what you want.

753
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,640
All they respect is balls.

754
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,000
Who's been putting this shit in your mind?

755
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,080
Those ggangpae friends of yours
that keep you out all night?

756
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,440
I see what's going on.

757
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,400
What's happened to you?

758
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,800
I brought you to this country
so you could have a future.

759
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,640
Don't piss it away.

760
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,680
Denise Frankel.

761
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

762
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,520
Please, thank you
for helping my daughter.

763
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,680
Clearly, this is not
about her immigration status.

764
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,320
But they're using her lack of status

765
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,800
to get around normal criminal
and juvenile proceedings.

766
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,920
My wife wants to know
when we can see her.

767
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,480
I'm working on that.

768
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,320
I'm pushing for a one-on-one
with the FBI task force officer tomorrow.

769
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,360
Right now, your entire family
is at risk for removal.

770
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,240
I recommend you do not
go back to your apartment.

771
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,040
Do you have any friends or family
with whom you can stay?

772
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,880
Rosa.

773
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,240
Come on, Rosa.

774
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,040
Rosa. Rosa.

775
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,920
Can't find you, Rosa.

776
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,080
And another one bites the dust.

777
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,280
We do our best.

778
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,560
I'm sure you do, sir.

779
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,080
Yes.

780
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,280
Yes, this is him.

781
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,000
Who?

782
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,440
Hey, Hamid.

783
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,760
Hamid? Hey, Hamid.

784
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,600
Hey!

785
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,640
What's up?

786
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,040
I, uh... It's my sister.

787
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,360
What's the matter?

788
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,360
Maybe you can help me.

789
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,200
Do you recognize him?

790
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,840
Agent Baraheri?

791
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,760
It's her boss,

792
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,840
from the print shop where she works.

793
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,520
We've got security video
from the motel

794
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,840
of an unidentified male perp

795
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,400
in a hooded sweatshirt
leaving the scene.

796
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,240
Time of death somewhere
between 11 and midnight.

797
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,000
Did you know that your sister
was having relations

798
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,600
with Mr. Bedraz,

799
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,480
who was married with two young kids?

800
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,800
I never talked to her

801
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,800
about the details of her private life, no.

802
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,160
Do you know of anyone

803
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,560
who may have had it in for her?

804
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,560
Jealous lover, perhaps?

805
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,280
Like I said, I didn't get into her life.

806
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,560
There's something else.

807
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,080
I found these while going through
Mr. Bedraz' jacket

808
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,320
looking for identification.

809
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,040
They come in sets of threes.

810
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,160
Green card, driver's license, social.

811
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,560
All counterfeit.

812
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,080
We found more of this stuff
at his apartment

813
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,760
earlier this afternoon.

814
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,360
As best we can figure,

815
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,640
he was cranking them out
after hours at the store.

816
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,440
We've referred that end of it

817
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,880
to your documented benefit
for our task force.

818
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,040
Think it might be Mexican mafia,

819
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,840
upset about him cutting into their action?

820
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,880
We're looking at a number
of possibilities right now.

821
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,520
When would be a good time to interview

822
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,120
your other family members,
Agent Baraheri?

823
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,720
Can I just...

824
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,640
I'd like to spend a moment
with my sister alone, please.

825
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,320
Of course.

826
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,720
Um...

827
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,240
I'm sorry for your loss.

828
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,640
I hate the fucking smell of that place.

829
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,080
I know you're judging me, Max.

830
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,440
What are you talking about?

831
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,080
My sister.

832
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,760
What you witnessed last night.

833
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,480
Now I'm mourning her.

834
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,320
You doubt the veracity of my heart.

835
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,600
I'm just sitting here
feeling your pain, my friend.

836
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,960
Feeling for your entire family.

837
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,680
It's a sad, terrible thing, your loss.

838
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,200
No way do I doubt
your love for your sister.

839
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,520
No way.

840
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,560
Well, if you need someone
to talk it through with...

841
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,080
Thank you.

842
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,520
Officially, she's being held

843
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,245
for an unlawful presence
in the United States.

844
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,880
Unofficially... and I'll never repeat this
outside this room...

845
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,200
she's being detained
for presenting an imminent threat

846
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,160
to the security of the United States,

847
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,520
based upon evidence
that she planned to be a suicide bomber.

848
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,520
And what evidence would that be?

849
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,440
Don't play coy with me, counselor.

850
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,280
The signs are all there.

851
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,200
We're talking about
a devout Muslim young woman

852
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,440
who at 15 years of age
walks around veiled.

853
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,360
Who engages in internet talk
focused on the duty of Jihad.

854
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,520
And writes openly about suicide.

855
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,600
Did you take a look at her bedroom?

856
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,480
How austere it was?

857
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,520
This isn't the life of a normal teenager.

858
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,840
Everything about her is a red flag.

859
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,640
Only when viewed through
the distorted looking glass

860
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,360
of your own paranoias.

861
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,880
I could joust with you all day,

862
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,320
but here's the reality of our situation.

863
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,000
She's illegal. She's removable.

864
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,960
And I intend to have Immigration
and Customs Enforcement remove her

865
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,320
to ensure the safety
of the American people.

866
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,120
Just like that?

867
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,720
You would uproot
a 15-year-old American teenager

868
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,480
who came to this country
when she was 3 years old?

869
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,440
Who doesn't speak Bangla,

870
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,560
at least not with any fluency.

871
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,040
And based on the most
circumstantial of evidence,

872
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,640
you would exile her
to a Third World garbage dump

873
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,840
that to her might as well be
another planet?

874
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,840
That's exactly what
I'm going to do, counselor.

875
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,080
What about the rest of the family?

876
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,000
The two younger siblings
are American citizens.

877
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,640
Yes, they're American citizens,

878
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,440
and they're shit out of luck.

879
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,200
Unless...

880
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,160
Have you got company?

881
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,800
No.

882
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,000
Are you looking for some?

883
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,480
I'm not being funny, all right, Claire?

884
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,440
But I just want to know
why some INS guy

885
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,320
would commit fraud for you.

886
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,800
It's not like you're famous enough

887
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,520
- to get that kind of visa.
- All right.

888
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,640
No, I'm only saying.
I only know 'cause I tried.

889
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,440
Well, they don't call it the INS anymore.

890
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,600
Gavin?

891
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,440
Come on.

892
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,320
I always thought I'd have to marry
an American guy.

893
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,080
That's why I didn't see
any point in us, you know?

894
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,400
But I don't have to do that now.

895
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,920
I don't have to marry an American guy.

896
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,360
I can be with the guy that I'm into.

897
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,760
This changes everything for us.

898
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,840
You know?

899
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,160
I just, uh...

900
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,400
I just want to know
why he's taking all that risk for you.

901
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,760
- You know?
- Oh.

902
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,040
Are you paying him?

903
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,760
Where'd you even get the case worker?

904
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,120
Oh, baby.

905
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,120
No.

906
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,960
It... Don't go there, baby.

907
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,600
Oh, come on, Claire.

908
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,000
How are you paying him?

909
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:58,960
Well... Come back.

910
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,960
No. How are you paying him, Claire?

911
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,600
How are you paying him?

912
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,440
No. No.

913
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,320
You are fucking kidding me.

914
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,000
I am such a fucking idiot.

915
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,000
You are fuck... Are you serious?

916
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,800
Baby, I want to be with you, baby.

917
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,040
You know I want to be with you.

918
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,445
Were you with him today?

919
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,240
- Please don't do this.
- Were you with him today?

920
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,040
- Baby, please don't do this.
- Just tell me. Were you with him today?

921
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,200
Was he inside of you today?
Were you with him today?

922
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,280
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck. How many times?

923
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,560
How many times, Claire?

924
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,720
I just want to know.

925
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,640
I just want to know
how fucked you have to get

926
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,680
to get a fucking green card!

927
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,280
Fuck!

928
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,080
Um...

929
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,240
as often as he wants.

930
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,320
It's only for two months,

931
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,400
and then I never have to see him again.

932
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,320
And I never have to worry

933
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,480
about being deported or being narced on.

934
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,960
I can just...

935
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,640
Hey!

936
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,980
Easy. Easy.

937
00:58:56,015 --> 00:58:57,520
Immigration!

938
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,120
Mireya?

939
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,840
- Hey, hold her!
- Mireya?

940
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,160
<i>Lo siento. Lo siento.</i>

941
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,800
Thanks.

942
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,320
I'm sorry. You have very few options,

943
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,800
none of them favorable
to your situation.

944
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,520
You may request
voluntary departure as an entire family

945
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,840
and leave the United States
immediately.

946
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,085
Or you may choose to fight the matter,

947
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,840
which inevitably would
lead to deportation.

948
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,720
There is a third option.

949
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,200
And as painful as it is,

950
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,240
I am required to present it to you.

951
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,920
One of you could choose
voluntary departure

952
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and leave with Taslima,

953
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,240
and one of you could remain in the U.S.

954
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,240
with Jahanara and Abul.

955
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,560
How is that possible?

956
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,200
Special Agent Phadkar has intimated to me

957
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,240
that if we were to choose
that course of action,

958
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,400
Immigration would not seek out
the remaining parent,

959
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,440
provided they kept a low profile.

960
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,880
There is something else
you should understand.

961
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,000
Whichever of you remains,

962
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,285
if you choose that,

963
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,480
if you try to see Taslima
before she leaves,

964
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,400
you would be taking a really big risk.

965
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,600
In all likelihood, she will be escorted
by Immigration agents

966
01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:24,320
all the way to her departure gate.

967
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,840
All right, girls.
Come on! Lights out.

968
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,720
- Under the covers.
- Lights out in two minutes.

969
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,040
<i>Vamanos, María.</i>

970
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,040
You look like you need a friend.

971
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,600
Are you waiting for your mommy
to come get you, too?

972
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,280
Yeah.

973
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,520
Yeah, I am.

974
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,680
When is she coming?

975
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,565
Any day now.

976
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,400
Do you know any good stories?

977
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,520
I know a lot of good stories.

978
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,005
All right, girls. Lights out!

979
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,240
Come here,
and I'll tell you all the best ones.

980
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,560
Time for bed!

981
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,320
And how could you disbelieve

982
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,000
while to you were being recited
the verses of Allah.

983
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,200
Good evening, Mrs. Sanchez.

984
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,240
This is Special Agent Max Brogan.

985
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,280
Yes, that's right.

986
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,000
I was wondering if Mireya had turned up.

987
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,520
No, no, señora.
I don't have any word.

988
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,520
I'm asking you.

989
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,280
Señora, we don't know.

990
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,160
I'll keep making inquiries.

991
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,080
Sorry to bother you.

992
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,560
Thank you, señora.

993
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,680
Good night.

994
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,400
<i>Gracias.</i>

995
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,800
Hey, Chin.

996
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,480
- Good morning.
- Black suit.

997
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,680
This is clean and press.
You gotta get the smell out of it.

998
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,320
- Hospital, hmm?
- Yeah.

999
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,720
Thank you.

1000
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,120
Uh, better not forget this.

1001
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,880
Very nice.

1002
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,200
Hey, can we do this now or what, huh?

1003
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm leaving her.

1004
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,160
Okay.

1005
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,680
We won't have to skulk around anymore.

1006
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,120
Skulking's fine with me.

1007
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,040
I'm not exactly proud
of this arrangement.

1008
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,400
I don't want an arrangement.

1009
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,560
- Cole...
- Just listen to me.

1010
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,880
I know this started in a fucked-up place.

1011
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,480
And that you are not here
on your own volition.

1012
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,960
And that there's a...

1013
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,600
there's a good chance
I probably make your skin crawl.

1014
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,760
I just want us to start over again.

1015
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,400
I wouldn't say who I was.

1016
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,400
I wouldn't put any kind of scare in you.

1017
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,800
Just ask you out for a cup of coffee.

1018
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,240
I'm not looking to renegotiate.

1019
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,200
You're not hearing me.

1020
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,440
No.

1021
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,040
You're not hearing me.

1022
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,400
This is what you need
to understand, okay?

1023
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,560
When I come into
one of these fleabag rooms,

1024
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,200
I switch off.

1025
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,880
You might as well be making it
with a rubber fuck doll,

1026
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,160
because she'd be giving you more emotion
than you'd ever get from me.

1027
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,080
When I get home,

1028
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,280
I'm an hour in the shower,

1029
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,960
getting clean of you.

1030
01:04:22,995 --> 01:04:24,600
That is the extent of it.

1031
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,000
That is as real
as it is ever going to get between us.

1032
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,200
Is that clear enough...

1033
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,560
for you?

1034
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,960
Hmm?

1035
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,440
So you want to do this now or what?

1036
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,360
You won't hear from me again.

1037
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,600
And your green card will be in the mail.

1038
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,440
Good luck, Claire.

1039
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,640
Hamid.

1040
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,440
How are you doing?

1041
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,160
Hmm.

1042
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,440
Hey, listen,

1043
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,080
you left your jacket in the car
on the way back from the morgue.

1044
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,120
You were complaining
about the smell,

1045
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,920
so I took it to the dry cleaners.

1046
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,160
You can pick it up any time.

1047
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,200
That wasn't necessary, but thanks.

1048
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,160
This fell out of the pocket
at the cleaners.

1049
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,240
I was wondering why it wasn't in
her personal effects envelope.

1050
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:18,280
She broke it a few days ago.

1051
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,200
I said I'd get it fixed.

1052
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,125
Repaired.

1053
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,280
I got a friend
with a shop on Western, and...

1054
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,520
Thanks for coming, Max.

1055
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,400
Gavin Kossef?

1056
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,080
Gavin Kossef!

1057
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,000
Uh, yeah.

1058
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,240
I have to be honest
with you, Mr. Kossef.

1059
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,160
I don't see much experience here
as a religious worker.

1060
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,880
You're not an ordained rabbi, are you?

1061
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,640
Uh, no, no, I'm not.

1062
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,800
But I've spent many years
devoted to my faith.

1063
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,880
Uh, I grew up in a religious family,

1064
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,240
I attended services regularly.

1065
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,920
I was bar mitzvahed.

1066
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,640
I've taken Jewish leadership courses...

1067
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,560
I'm still not sure that qualifies you.

1068
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,600
You know, I honor my religion daily.

1069
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,280
You know, in the Jewish
school where I teach,

1070
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,160
I lead the class in prayers.

1071
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,360
We discuss Bible stories.

1072
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,160
And you've been working
at this school illegally, right?

1073
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,280
Yes, I... I have.

1074
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,400
Yeah. But I've admitted to that.

1075
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,040
You can read the language?

1076
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,040
- Hebrew, right?
- Yes.

1077
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,960
And what about the prayers?

1078
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,080
You can, uh... You can recite

1079
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,600
the important prayers of your faith?

1080
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,640
You can do that, right?

1081
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,080
Uh, yes. Yes.

1082
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,440
I can do the prayer for wine,

1083
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,160
um, the prayer for bread...

1084
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,480
Excuse me just a moment.

1085
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,720
Shit.

1086
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,760
Fuck.

1087
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,800
Come in.
Close the door right behind you.

1088
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,800
Mr. Kossef, this is Rabbi Yoffie.

1089
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,840
Uh, Rabbi.

1090
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,720
Ordinarily, I'd file
a request for evidence.

1091
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,240
But something tells me this approach
will prove more expedient.

1092
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,680
I'd like Mr. Kossef to recite a prayer

1093
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,760
to substantiate his knowledge of
the Jewish teachings

1094
01:09:47,795 --> 01:09:49,200
above that of a layman's.

1095
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,760
If you could suggest something
and authenticate his response,

1096
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,680
I'd greatly appreciate it, Rabbi.

1097
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,560
You may recite
the Mourner's Kaddish, no?

1098
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,560
The Mourner's Kaddish?

1099
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,280
<i>Nu?</i>

1100
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,400
Uh, yes. Yeah.

1101
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,480
Uh...

1102
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,245
It's a tradition that you cover your head.

1103
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,320
If you just put your hands
on your head like that.

1104
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,560
Right?

1105
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,320
- Um... like that.
- Yeah.

1106
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,840
Amen.

1107
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,280
Very nice.

1108
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,000
Very moving.

1109
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,600
You should sing
in my services sometimes.

1110
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,200
Oh, I... I would love to.

1111
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,120
Thank you very much, Rabbi.

1112
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,040
We'll be with you shortly.

1113
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,080
Thank you.

1114
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,920
Well, can't argue with that.

1115
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,760
Rabbi?

1116
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,840
I wasn't kidding about the voice.

1117
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,080
I expect you tomorrow morning,

1118
01:11:56,115 --> 01:11:57,760
Temple Beth Shalom.

1119
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,760
About the rest, we can teach you.

1120
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:34,120
I don't want to leave Jah and Abul.

1121
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,040
When will I ever see them again?

1122
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,240
Or Papa?

1123
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,760
He wants to be able
to say goodbye to you,

1124
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,440
but what if he was to come here today?

1125
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,040
They would arrest him
and deport him as well.

1126
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,040
And then Jah and Abul
will have to leave as well.

1127
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,600
I don't care!

1128
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,760
Why can't we all go?

1129
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,440
Why do they get to stay?

1130
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,000
Because they were born here.

1131
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,040
And if they stay and finish school,

1132
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,920
they have more opportunities.

1133
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,400
And I don't

1134
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,280
because my life is shit now.

1135
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,280
I'm sorry. We're out of time.

1136
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,920
I am with you, daughter.

1137
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,720
Mommy!

1138
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,040
Mommy, please!

1139
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,600
Please!

1140
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,560
Please don't leave me, Mommy!

1141
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:56,080
I will always be there to love you.

1142
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:00,080
We will travel together.

1143
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,800
God willing...
one day we will all be reunited.

1144
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,000
Come, my sweets.

1145
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,880
Say goodbye to your sister.

1146
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,960
You won't be seeing her for a long time.

1147
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:32,280
Please, I need the room for the next visit.

1148
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,920
Did Homicide see these tapes?

1149
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,440
No. They figured it was gang-related,

1150
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,280
so they only looked at
the night of the murder.

1151
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,880
Slow down. Slow down.
That's them.

1152
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,400
Stop.

1153
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,240
That's the girl.

1154
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,640
Back up a little bit.

1155
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,720
This car that just pulled in here.

1156
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,280
Move in on there.

1157
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,840
Can't make anybody.

1158
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,400
Let's put another tape in.

1159
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,640
Roll on down.

1160
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,600
Slow it up. That's them.

1161
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,880
Stop.

1162
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,840
Well, I'll be damned.

1163
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,760
There he is again.

1164
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,480
- Can you go in on the license plate?
- Sure.

1165
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:27,080
2SAM564

1166
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,720
Let's go to the next day.

1167
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,200
There they are, coming out.

1168
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,120
Back up a little bit.

1169
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,640
Go in on it.

1170
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,845
Same car.

1171
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,120
It's the same goddamn car.

1172
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,800
Let me run that.

1173
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,920
Another, please.

1174
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,440
Another, please.

1175
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,520
Last call, pal.

1176
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,320
Hey, Yong. You ready to
pop your cherry, bitch?

1177
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,920
Fuckin' balls, man! Come on!

1178
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,360
Come on, you fuckin' pussy!

1179
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,120
Get your fuckin' hands up!

1180
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,440
Move, motherfucker! You, too, bitch!

1181
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,680
Move it! Come on!

1182
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,520
Stand the fuck down, you fucking cunt!

1183
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,160
Open the fucking door!

1184
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,600
Don't you fucking dick me, old man!

1185
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,600
Open the fucking door now!

1186
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,520
Open the fucking door!

1187
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,160
You making big mistake.

1188
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,280
You have no idea
who money belongs to.

1189
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,560
If I give to you, I die anyway.

1190
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,120
Get the fuck back up, motherfucker!

1191
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,040
Get the fuck back up!

1192
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,240
Shut up!

1193
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,200
What the fuck?

1194
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,560
What'd you go and do that for?

1195
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,480
We weren't supposed to
hurt anyone, Seung!

1196
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,720
That's it! Search him! Find the key!

1197
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,800
Move, bitch! Shut the fuck up!

1198
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,000
Shut the fuck up!

1199
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,280
Get the fuck up!

1200
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,360
Yeah, blow her fucking head
off if she tries anything! Let's go!

1201
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,120
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1202
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,680
- Where's the key?
- Right, which fucking key?

1203
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,600
- Which key? Which key?
- I don't know!

1204
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:49,720
Which fucking key, bitch?

1205
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,040
Fuck it. We're all in...

1206
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,720
Put it down, man. I'll do it. I swear!

1207
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,520
You'll do her?

1208
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,120
Where the fuck did you
learn to talk like that, huh?

1209
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,600
You get that on some American cop show
while you're growing up in Seoul?

1210
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,400
I'm not from fucking Seoul.
I'm from.

1211
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:34,240
Hey. How old were you when you came over?
You still got an accent.

1212
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,160
- I'm gonna say maybe 11, 12 years old.
- I don't give a shit!

1213
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,000
I'm gonna blow this bag's
head off if you don't put down your gun!

1214
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,760
Uh-huh. You still on the green card?

1215
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,160
I'm American citizen, raghead!

1216
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,880
My whole family just got naturalized!

1217
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,920
We're doing all
ceremony shit tomorrow!

1218
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,520
Oh, tomorrow?

1219
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,400
Hey. You haven't taken your oath yet.

1220
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,760
That means you're not a citizen.

1221
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,960
Not until you take the oath.

1222
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:01,560
And I don't see how the fuck
that's gonna happen now, you know?

1223
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,400
You're either gonna die here,
or you're going away for murder.

1224
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,480
You have done your parents proud.

1225
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,520
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

1226
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,360
They told me no one get hurt.

1227
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,960
I didn't kill anyone!

1228
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,240
What am I supposed to do?

1229
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,320
I don't know what to fucking do!

1230
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,400
- How many in your family?
- Why do you keep asking about my family?

1231
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,120
They're not here now, are they?

1232
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,760
How many in your family?

1233
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,080
My parents.

1234
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,080
My younger brother and sister.

1235
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,520
My sister was born here.

1236
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,120
Well, tomorrow was supposed
to be a special day.

1237
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,560
And you shit on it
for your whole family.

1238
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,560
I've been through it.

1239
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,440
It was the most spiritual
moment of my life.

1240
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,600
You know, you're standing there,

1241
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,960
looking around you
at all these people from everywhere.

1242
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,960
Countries you can't even pronounce,

1243
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,600
you didn't even know existed.

1244
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,000
And they're happy.

1245
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,800
They're elated to be there

1246
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,600
because it's their choice.

1247
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:23,160
You wouldn't be here right now,

1248
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,680
in this mess you're in,

1249
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:30,560
if you could ever appreciate the awe
you'd feel in that moment.

1250
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,400
The worthiness of the journey.

1251
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,760
So,

1252
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,040
when you're standing there tomorrow,

1253
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,020
in your new suit and tie,

1254
01:22:42,055 --> 01:22:43,880
I want you to look around.

1255
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,320
Okay? Look at those faces.

1256
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,840
And understand
the sublime promise of this moment.

1257
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:00,245
What the fuck, man.

1258
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,880
I'm not gonna be there.
You said it yourself.

1259
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,880
Stop messing with my head.

1260
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,240
All right. The way to end this,

1261
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,560
my friend, is for you
to put down your gun.

1262
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,880
- Now I'm gonna put mine...
- What the fuck!

1263
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,360
What the fuck are you doing?

1264
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,480
What the fuck...

1265
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,920
Now you put down your gun.

1266
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,960
Let go of that woman.
You go in that back room.

1267
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,360
You take the surveillance
tapes out of the system.

1268
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,120
Okay? And you keep on walking.

1269
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,280
You're fucking with me.
Stop fucking with me!

1270
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,040
You think I'm some jackoff? Huh?

1271
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,040
I think you made a mistake,

1272
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,440
and you will never make
a mistake like this again.

1273
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,160
LAPD! Put your hands up!

1274
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,280
Get 'em up!

1275
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,160
Relax.

1276
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,800
Situation's under control.

1277
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,720
Help me out here.
You're saying there were four of them,

1278
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,800
but the owner's wife is
positive there were five.

1279
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,760
She says you let one of them walk.

1280
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,280
She also says you let him take
the surveillance tapes with him.

1281
01:24:18,315 --> 01:24:21,800
She's confused. She had her
head down most of the time.

1282
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,480
Hey, I killed four of them.
Why would I let one go?

1283
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,520
I look crazy to you?

1284
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,240
I can tell you how many there were.

1285
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,360
There were only four. She's mistaken.

1286
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:37,080
This man, he saved our lives.

1287
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:38,400
There were four.

1288
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,560
The witness has corroborated it.

1289
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,480
They must have been
lax in surveillance.

1290
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,920
Probably just covering up
for insurance purposes.

1291
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,720
Hamid. Where the fuck are you?

1292
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,000
I need to talk to you
as soon as possible.

1293
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,120
Give me a call as soon
as you get this message.

1294
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,440
Immediately. I don't care what time it is.

1295
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,400
<i>One message.</i>

1296
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,880
<i>Max, it's Kevin.</i>

1297
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,840
<i>Listen, call me when you can.</i>

1298
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,000
<i>Just a heads up.</i>

1299
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,320
<i>LAPD contacted me a few minutes ago.</i>

1300
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,840
<i>Apparently, Hamid was
involved in a shootout tonight in Koreatown.</i>

1301
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,760
<i>Don't worry. He's fine,
but I'm heading over</i>

1302
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,880
<i>to the crime scene now to check things out.</i>

1303
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,880
<i>Try me on my cell.</i>

1304
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
<i>End of messages.</i>

1305
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,120
"I'm not interested in you.
I'm not interested.

1306
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,965
"I'm not interested in you.

1307
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,920
For one, you're too old for me. "

1308
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06,080
Miss Shepard,
I'm Special Agent Ludwig

1309
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,440
with ICE's Document
and Benefit fraud unit.

1310
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,320
This is my partner, Special Agent Howell.

1311
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,120
May we have a word
with you inside, please?

1312
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,120
We discovered these
and quite a few others

1313
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,000
when we performed a search
of Javier Pedraza's apartment.

1314
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,325
I didn't, um, use these.
I didn't go back for them.

1315
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,240
- So you can't, um...
- You see what's interesting, Miss Shepard,

1316
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,280
is we ran a check on your name.

1317
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,280
A Claire Shepard arrived
on a B2 visitor's visa

1318
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,640
seven months ago.

1319
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,040
And then just two days ago,
she has her status adjusted

1320
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,560
to an EB-1 green card for
persons of extraordinary ability.

1321
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,600
According to the Internet Movie Database,

1322
01:26:40,635 --> 01:26:41,840
the only Claire Shepard

1323
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,280
that matches your spelling,
age, and place of birth,

1324
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,640
has two credits on
little-known Aussie TV shows.

1325
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,160
Walk-on roles.

1326
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,640
She hasn't won any national
or international awards.

1327
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,040
Which is something
the adjudicator who handled your case

1328
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,760
would have to have been aware of.

1329
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,320
And yet he approved you for an EB-1.

1330
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:00,720
Miss Shepard.

1331
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,200
We'd like you to tell us
about your relationship

1332
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,920
with Center Adjudications
Officer Cole Frankel.

1333
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,040
Congratulations, McGill.

1334
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:20,880
Mr. Frankel.

1335
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,640
Special Agents Poulson and Womack.

1336
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,200
OIG.

1337
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,200
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1338
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:29,880
What is this, a joke?

1339
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,480
I take it you're familiar
with Claire Shepard.

1340
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,960
She just traded you
for voluntary departure.

1341
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,840
Turn around, please.

1342
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,000
Hands behind your back.

1343
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,400
Do you have to do this?
Do you have to cuff me?

1344
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,560
Yeah, I'm afraid we do.

1345
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,880
What the hell is this?

1346
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,680
Cole, where are you go...
where... what's going on?

1347
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,520
Ma'am, your husband is under arrest
for immigration fraud.

1348
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,160
Cole.

1349
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,240
Good morning, everyone.

1350
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:16,000
My name is Judge Leslie Freeman,

1351
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,685
of the Federal District Court.

1352
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:22,800
And it is my great pleasure
to welcome you here today.

1353
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:26,840
All of you seated here
share one thing in common.

1354
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,920
You have all chosen,
of your own free will,

1355
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,160
to become citizens of this great nation.

1356
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,800
For many of you, the road
to this joyous moment

1357
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,720
has been fraught with
hardship and sacrifice.

1358
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,760
It is incumbent upon me to remind you

1359
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,000
of your newfound responsibilities
as citizens,

1360
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:52,160
and also to remind you
that an American citizenship

1361
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,280
is not a guarantee of success

1362
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:57,160
but rather the promise of opportunities.

1363
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,405
Unlimited opportunities.

1364
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,880
It has always been my contention

1365
01:29:01,915 --> 01:29:04,320
that America is a welcoming nation,

1366
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:07,040
a country that accepts every new citizen

1367
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,960
with an embrace of good faith.

1368
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,640
You have endless credit
to pursue your hopes and dreams,

1369
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,440
as long as you honor
the rules and laws of our society.

1370
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,840
I myself am a first-generation American.

1371
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,240
- I guess I called it right.
- Max?

1372
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,440
Well, he's gotta put the family first.

1373
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,800
Ain't that right, Hamid?

1374
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,680
You know what I'm talking about.

1375
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,720
- Do we have to do this right now?
- Yes, God damn it. Right now.

1376
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,520
An innocent...
yes, innocent young woman

1377
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,040
was brutally murdered 'cause
she flashed a little tit

1378
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,320
on occasion, got it on
with a married man,

1379
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:46,160
tried to live her life
outside your goddamn family.

1380
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:50,000
She was your sister.

1381
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,360
She deserved better
than that from you.

1382
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,800
In this country,
we don't abide by that shit.

1383
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,280
We got a name for it. Murder.

1384
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,800
Cold-blooded murder.

1385
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:05,160
And you and Farid
are going down for it.

1386
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,240
Will our new citizens please stand?

1387
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,920
Raise your right hand

1388
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,480
and join me in reciting
the Oath of Allegiance.

1389
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,480
I hereby declare on oath...

1390
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,000
I've got the surveillance
tapes from the motel.

1391
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:23,480
From the day before.
From last week.

1392
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,005
I.D.'d Farid's Beemer.

1393
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,080
He was watching her,
reporting back to you,

1394
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,760
waiting for you to take action.

1395
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,560
I begged him, Max, to leave it alone,

1396
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,160
but he was being
pressured by our father.

1397
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,160
We both were.
He poisoned Farid's mind

1398
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,720
with this talk about the shame
that we brought on our family,

1399
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,800
because of her. But he never...

1400
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:47,160
he never intended
for this to happen.

1401
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:53,400
Only that we would
teach her a lesson.

1402
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,080
We were supposed to
catch them in the act

1403
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,120
and beat them like dogs.

1404
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,720
My father wanted Zahra humiliated,

1405
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,920
- brought in line.
- Congratulations to all you citizens.

1406
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,280
I wanted no part of it.

1407
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:17,480
I thought if I just turned my back,

1408
01:31:17,515 --> 01:31:18,720
it would all go away.

1409
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:25,320
And now will you please stand

1410
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,765
and place your right hand over your heart

1411
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,760
as we listen to Phil Perry
sing our National Anthem.

1412
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,760
# Oh say #

1413
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:38,080
# Can you see #

1414
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,400
# By the dawn's #

1415
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:44,680
# early light #

1416
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,640
He arrived at my apartment that night.

1417
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:51,520
After he...

1418
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,600
Help me, Hamid.
Please, God, help me.

1419
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,680
How did you get this?

1420
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:03,445
Where's Zahra?

1421
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,800
- I only wanted to scare her.
- What are you talking about?

1422
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,720
I couldn't stand it anymore.

1423
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,880
- Her seeing a degenerate fucking beaner.
- What did you do, Farid?

1424
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,520
I only wanted to get
in his face a little bit.

1425
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,160
You have to take this.

1426
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,440
You're a cop. You know how
to do that kind of stuff.

1427
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,600
What did you do, Farid?

1428
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,040
I looked in the door.

1429
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,040
They were doing it like animals.

1430
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,680
Oh, shit!

1431
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,160
What the fuck are you doing?
Get out of here!

1432
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,240
What the fuck is this shit?

1433
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,680
What's your fucking problem?

1434
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,320
What did you do to our sister?
Tell me what you did!

1435
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,080
She's my girl, man.

1436
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,040
She's my girl. Don't be stupid.

1437
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,880
Put the fucking gun down.

1438
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,040
Get the fuck outta here, man!

1439
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,280
# In air #

1440
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:50,600
# Gave proof #

1441
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:54,320
# Through this night #

1442
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,320
You should have come
to me, God damn it.

1443
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:59,040
I was ashamed.

1444
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,040
Ashamed of myself.

1445
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:01,840
My family.

1446
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,360
What have you told him?
What are you doing?

1447
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,120
Better get yourself
a good criminal attorney, Counselor.

1448
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,100
You're gonna need one.

1449
01:33:10,135 --> 01:33:11,960
#... star-spangled #

1450
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:18,120
# Banner yet wave #

1451
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:28,840
# For the land of the free #

1452
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,240
Running out on our National Anthem.

1453
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,080
Now, that's just plain disrespectful.

1454
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:37,080
# And the home #

1455
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,040
# Of the #

1456
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,960
# Brave #

1457
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,400
Farid Baraheri, you are under arrest

1458
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,600
for the murder of your
sister, Zahra Baraheri,

1459
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,560
and Javier Pedraza.

1460
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:03,080
Congratulations to all our new citizens.

1461
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,760
Good luck to all of you.

1462
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,560
820 Bravo.

1463
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,640
75 approaching position
reported by Foxtrot.

1464
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,160
820 on 10-42 Delta.

1465
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,760
Approximately eighth of a mile
east of Ambush Alley.

1466
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,760
Confirming a female victim.
Mexican national.

1467
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,480
Approximate age, mid-20s.

1468
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:56,720
Looks like she's been
out here a couple of days.

1469
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,400
I think she paid the wrong
coyote to bring her across.

1470
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,720
<i>I copy. You are 10-42 Delta</i>

1471
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,720
<i>one eighth mile east of Ambush Alley.</i>

1472
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,800
<i>I'll contact the PD and the coroner.</i>

1473
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,520
10-4, 820. I'm standing by at this location.

1474
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,640
<i>10-4, Bravo 75.</i>

1475
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:13,240
<i>I'll also notify your FOS.</i>

1476
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,960
Guess who's going home today.

1477
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,600
All of my friends leave.

1478
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,040
Not today, sweetie.

1479
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,760
Someone's come for you.

1480
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,680
Uh-oh. All right.

1481
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,200
When we get in there,
it's gonna be a real clusterfuck,

1482
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,400
so watch your ass.

1483
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,200
You got it.

1484
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:31,560
Here we go.

1485
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:33,960
Wait a second.

1486
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,040
Brogan.

1487
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:40,200
Yeah, that was me.

1488
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,000
You sure about that?

1489
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:48,720
Mireya Sanchez.

1490
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,680
What about the family? Have you...

1491
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:58,800
Uh, do me a favor, will ya?
Hold off on that.

1492
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,800
I'd like to take care of it myself.

1493
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:05,720
I just want to do right by her.

1494
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,960
Thanks. I'll be down
as soon as I'm off shift.

1495
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,560
God damn it, Max. We gotta roll, man.

1496
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,360
Max! We gotta go!

1497
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,520
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

1498
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:24,880
You're not gonna miss anything.
