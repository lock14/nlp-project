1
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,199
We open up against
Michigan in two weeks.

2
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,800
Coach's got me hitting
the bench pretty hard.

3
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,399
Shit. How much is a lot?

4
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,200
One... No, two.

5
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,600
I'm putting up three hundy.

6
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, let's see, Tasty.

7
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,399
Wow!

8
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,099
Um...

9
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,900
Wow, you're really pretty. I've never seen...

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,400
No, stop it, stop it.

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,299
Don't be so fucking desperate.
Come on, be a dick. Be cool.

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,900
Don't be a pussy.
Tell her she's an ugly skank.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,599
Yeah.

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,900
Not bad.

15
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:29,500
I've seen better.

16
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,500
Yeah, whatever.

17
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,099
Coach's got us running two-a-days,
so I gotta bounce.

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,099
Miss Tasty? How did you get here?

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
Shh!

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,400
Ian, wake up, faggot. Judge rolls in 20,

21
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,599
so if you want a ride to work
you better get your poop in a group.

22
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,800
- Okay, I'll be right down.
- No. Now, Clay Aiken.

23
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,199
Hey...

24
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,900
- Ow! Cut it out.
- Hurts, doesn't it?

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,099
Shut up! I'm trying to sleep.

26
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,500
Hey, sorry, Big D. Just go back to sleep.

27
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,900
- You, get up.
- Give me a minute.

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,199
What are you hiding?

29
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,300
You got a big fattie under there, don't you?

30
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,599
Yeah, you do. You're stroking it, too.
Oh! What the F?

31
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,199
Good. My boys are all here.

32
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,199
- Dad, Ian's free...
- Can it, Rex.

33
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,699
Your pop's got a bombshell to drop,
so ears open.

34
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Last night,
your old man popped the question.

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,599
Show them, Karen.

36
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm so happy.

37
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,899
Hey, way to go!

38
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:26,300
Ian, you wanna get off your duff
and come over here and give Karen a hug?

39
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,399
Um...

40
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,100
- Yeah, Ian, get up. You're being rude.
- Can we do that later?

41
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,500
- Damn it, Ian, get up...
- No, no, honey. It's okay.

42
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,600
We have to give him time
to get used to the idea.

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Karen?
- Are you okay?

44
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,000
Karen? Karen, honey?
- You okay?

45
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,699
Sweetheart?

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,600
What smells like jizz?

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,600
Let's go! Kick it in the ass, dildo!

48
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,899
Come on, get in. Get in!

49
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,500
You suck!

50
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,699
Okay, seriously.
Quit being such a fag and get in.

51
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,800
Never go down
So let's get it up

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,500
Ian, I'm gonna ask you a question,
and I want a straight answer.

53
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,199
- You queer?
- What?

54
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,800
- God damn it! I knew it!
- I didn't say anything.

55
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,100
Exactly. If someone asks you
if you're a pole smoker,

56
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,600
you just deny it, straight off.
No pause, no farting around.

57
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:51,800
Rex, I'm not gay.

58
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:55,000
Ian, you're 18,
and you've never had a girlfriend.

59
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,800
That's how people wind up getting gay,
you know.

60
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,800
I don't think that's really how it happens.

61
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:02,300
Is that not how it happens?
So tell me how it happens, expert.

62
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,800
Fucking cock expert. Cockspert.

63
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,899
Hey, what do you like better,
the shaft or the balls?

64
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,000
That's gross.
I don't know why you're talking about it.

65
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,300
Look, every guy's got a fantasy
about another guy,

66
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,100
but you got to bury that shit way down.
This is America, God damn it.

67
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,199
There is...
There is a girl that I've been kind of...

68
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,199
All right, I'm listening.
Where'd you meet her?

69
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,800
On the... Online.

70
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,000
What? For fuck's sake, Ian,
don't you watch Dateline?

71
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,500
She's probably a guy. Some fat old dude
who wants to ram you in the tailpipe.

72
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,100
But you'd love that, wouldn't you?
'Cause you're a homo.

73
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,500
Try not to come home any gayer
than you are now.

74
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,100
Hey

75
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:06,300
What's your favorite song?

76
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,300
Maybe we could hum along

77
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,800
Well, I think you're smart,
you sweet thing

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,699
Tell me your name,
I'm dying here

79
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,800
Got you where I want you

80
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,500
Yeah

81
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:49,000
- Hey, Becca. How are you?
- I'm good. I'm fine. Whatever.

82
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,199
Hey, Becca.
Looks like you had a long, nasty night.

83
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,100
- Ron and Ian want the four-one-uno.
- Whatever. You guys are gross.

84
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,800
- I'm not gross. I didn't say anything.
- Okay, who's going on coupon rounds?

85
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,600
- No, Becca, I did it yesterday.
- Please, Ian.

86
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,600
I love you so much.

87
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,399
Hello. This is a coupon for six free...
No? Okay. Sorry. Donuts? No.

88
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,100
- Six free donuts with the Bandito's Dozen.
- Thanks.

89
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,800
You're welcome. Sorry.

90
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,699
Excuse me. Do you know where the Gap is?

91
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,800
- It's just past the movie theater.
- Thanks, man.

92
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,700
Yeah, real funny.

93
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Free donuts, free coupons.

94
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,299
Felicia. How's it fitting, hon?

95
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,799
Well, you look nice.

96
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,700
You know, sweetie,
there's still time to have your boobs done

97
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,899
before my wedding.

98
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,500
Darren and I already discussed them,
and he said he'd pay for it.

99
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,700
I mean, he's a dentist,
so it's totally not a big deal.

100
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,200
Excuse me, do you have a pair of scissors?

101
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:15,299
Oh! Sure, sweetie. Do you have a stringie?

102
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,899
Oh, no. I was just hoping
you could slit my wrists for me quickly.

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,799
My husband killed himself last Christmas.

104
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,100
I am so sorry. I was just...

105
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,000
Hello. This is a coupon
for six free donuts. Donuts?

106
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,600
Oh, my God! You look so hot in that.

107
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,000
Hey, sweetheart, listen.
Please don't take this the wrong way,

108
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,000
but your whole trying too hard thing,

109
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,799
it's just coming across as needy,
you know?

110
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:49,200
And I think you're better than that,
Kimberly.

111
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:54,200
- But all I was saying was that...
- Shh! Let's see it in a large. Okay?

112
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,299
I mean, Christ,
I'm out buying him clothes right now.

113
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,299
He's 18 years old.
I don't have to do that shit anymore.

114
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,899
Look, Judy, listen, I'm sorry,
I'm losing you. I'm going into a tunnel.

115
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,200
Well, it's official, Lance,
your mom's still bat-shit crazy.

116
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,600
What? You're telling me
she doesn't shit-talk me?

117
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,500
No, actually, she doesn't. She doesn't, ever.

118
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,399
All right. Let me give you some advice,
Lance, all right?

119
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Don't ever get married.
Just an endless parade of horseshit.

120
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,299
And whatever you do, man,
always wear a rubber. Christ.

121
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,200
Nice. Always classy.

122
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey, come on, Lance, I didn't mean it like...
Come on, dawg.

123
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,600
Hey, sir. I've got something yummy
for your little girl.

124
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Oh, my God. Excuse me! Sorry!

125
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,500
- Ian? Oh, my God, dude, what happened?
- I don't know.

126
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
Is there a cock and balls
on the front of me again?

127
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,500
- Like a little tree trunk.
- Thank you.

128
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,500
Oh, my God.

129
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,500
- Whoa. You look pretty.
- God, shut up, Ian!

130
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,399
What? I'm just saying,
you usually dress so... You look nice.

131
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,799
Ian, why do you got to work the mouth
when you talk to us?

132
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,399
- Yeah, Ian.
- Sorry, it's a... It's a habit.

133
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Hey, that girl you work with, Becca,
you gonna bring her to my party tonight?

134
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,299
- Yeah, I asked her. She said no.
- Good. Dude, she's totally wrong for you.

135
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,799
That's what you say about everyone.

136
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,899
She made you wear
the fucking costume again, right?

137
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,399
- You know, I don't mind...
- Dude, if you told her to fuck off,

138
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,799
she'd be two knuckles deep right now
daydreaming about your big black cock.

139
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,100
Ian, do not listen to him.

140
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,799
Okay, girls want a nice guy
who's gonna treat them well.

141
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,500
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

142
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,799
Look, all I'm saying is
everybody wants a challenge.

143
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,299
- Everybody wants...
- What they can't get. I know, I got it.

144
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,299
- That shit does not work.
- It works on you.

145
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,100
No, it doesn't.

146
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,200
Felicia!

147
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,299
Balls! I got to go.
Evil cousin's spending the weekend.

148
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:08,200
- Pretty cousin?
- Ian, she's the anti-Christ.

149
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,399
- She's still super hot.
- Fuck you, too. See you.

150
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,500
So what happened with Becca?

151
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
You been doing like I told you,
being a dick?

152
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:19,700
Yeah, kind of. Being kind of a dick.
I'd say... No, not really.

153
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,600
I mean, you know,
I've sort of been practicing

154
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,899
your whole being-a-dick thing
with this girl I met online.

155
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,899
- And I get it, but I just...
- Thanks.

156
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,799
I don't think I could do that for real.

157
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:32,000
Dude, sure you can.
I believe in you, you know.

158
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,799
You just got to stop worrying
about being the good guy all the time.

159
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,000
I mean, okay,
look at Andy and Randy over there.

160
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,000
You think they care
what women think about them?

161
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,000
They could give a fuck.

162
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,299
- What's up? What's up?
- What's up, what's up?

163
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,700
Hi. I'm collecting for
the underprivileged children of Ecuador.

164
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,200
- Would you like to help?
- You wanna party?

165
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,500
Um... I'm kind of working right now.

166
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,899
- When are you done?
- Yeah, what are you doing after?

167
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
I have a church thing tonight.

168
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
- Kick ass, we'll come.
- Yeah, where is it?

169
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,700
Is there gonna be
more hot snatch like you there?

170
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Those guys are total nards.
They never get anywhere.

171
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,700
That's just 'cause they don't know
how to close.

172
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,399
But they're ability to open
is fucking heroic.

173
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,299
- Do you wear thong underpants?
- Do you want us to take our shirts off?

174
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,200
- Where do you live?
- Is your mom hot, too?

175
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,899
- Where do you live?
- What's your address?

176
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,700
- Do you want us to come over?
- Do you like pizza?

177
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,600
We've been to a motel.

178
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:26,200
- Fuck off, donut.
- Rex, it's me.

179
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,299
What the fuck is this all about?

180
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,299
I broke the key off of our locker.
I couldn't get my clothes out.

181
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,299
Stow that shit in the trunk.
Christ, you look like a Mexican butt-hole.

182
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,799
You suck.

183
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,200
Becca? Hey.

184
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Wow, I didn't know
that you were coming over.

185
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,700
Cool. I didn't even know
that you knew where I lived. I mean...

186
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,399
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

187
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,899
- So...
- Oh! It's a funny story. I broke...

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,799
I broke my key off
and Ron let me borrow the...

189
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,600
Anyway, so this is great.
You changed your mind.

190
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,899
Now, the party, it doesn't start

191
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,799
- for a few hours.
- Actually, I was wondering if Dylan's here.

192
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,600
- Dylan?
- Yeah. Is he here?

193
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,100
- My 14-year-old brother Dylan?
- Yeah.

194
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,100
- Nice underpants, Ian.
- Snap! Dang, that was funny.

195
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
You know he's 14, right?

196
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,200
Ian, dude, there's like 80 wet chicks here.
Get off your wallflower ass.

197
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:59,200
- Are you smoking cigars now?
- Yes.

198
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,600
- Hey, Lance. Tight party.
- Okay, rude.

199
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,500
You can see
I'm having a conversation here.

200
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Now, I'll be with you
in a few minutes, okay?

201
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,899
- Thank you.
- We're sorry.

202
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,899
- Don't apologize to her.
- I'm sorry.

203
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,500
Don't apologize to me.

204
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,000
Hey, I'm gonna go see
who Felicia's talking to.

205
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,299
No, dude, forget Felicia, okay?

206
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,399
I know you guys are BFF and all that shit,

207
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,899
but tonight's about getting that dick
a little daylight.

208
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,899
Hey, Lindsay, sweetheart,
where you going?

209
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
Come here, we're not done. Get in here.

210
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,399
- You know my boy Ian?
- Yeah. No. I don't know.

211
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,700
- You used to be on my paper route.
- Okay, sure. My mom likes you.

212
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,799
You know what else
about our boy Ian here?

213
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:44,399
Ian is a bust-ass virgin.

214
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,700
- I'm so sorry.
- He's fresh meat.

215
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,600
Yeah. No, I'm pretty stoked.
I got into the University of Wisconsin,

216
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,899
and I'm gonna go for veterinary medicine,
'cause that's where...

217
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,500
- Are you gonna go to college?
- University of Boulder.

218
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,200
It's a great party school.

219
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:06,700
Oh, you know, I read that they have
a really great astronomy program.

220
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
I don't know if that's
what you're going there for or...

221
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,399
Because it's really high elevation,
and you can see the stars really well...

222
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:18,500
Planets.

223
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,600
Wow! A little tip action there.
That's really suggestive.

224
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,899
I'm not saying that
you're gonna do that on my, well...

225
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,899
There, what, you're gonna... Two in there.

226
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
- Wow, you're really...
- Ian! Dude!

227
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,200
I'm... Could you excuse me for a second?

228
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,000
- Hey!
- Hey! What up?

229
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,799
- What are you doing in there, man?
- What're you doing out here, man?

230
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:46,700
- I asked you first.
- Uh... Nothing.

231
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,600
No, I just... I spilled beer on my shirt,
so then I had to...

232
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,600
- I thought you had, like, a girl in there.
- Yeah, right. I wish.

233
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,200
So, okay.
So, are your parents, like, still going

234
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,299
to Dylan's motor-cross thing this weekend?

235
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They all take off in the morning.

236
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,400
Okay. Awesome.

237
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,400
'Cause my evil cousin is driving me nuts,
so, I don't know,

238
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,700
you think, like, maybe I could hang
at your place this weekend?

239
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,500
Yeah. Yeah, like a sleepover or something.
It'll be fun.

240
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,799
Oh, my God! Thank you so much.
Hey, I have a secret.

241
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,700
- Look at you acting like such a girl.
- I know, I know. Okay, okay. Here it is.

242
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,000
I have a crush on someone, a boy, a guy.

243
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,200
Yeah? Well, who is it?

244
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:40,099
Come on, you know me better than anyone.
I bet you know who it is.

245
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:41,700
Come on, guess.

246
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,700
Um...

247
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,099
I think I know.

248
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,200
I'm kidding. Oh, God! I got you.
You're so easy. You're so easy!

249
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,299
- You're my best friend.
- I know, and you're my best friend.

250
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,299
That's why it's funny that we would kiss,
because we wouldn't.

251
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,599
So who is it? Who's the lucky caballero?

252
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,299
Um... Nobody.

253
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,200
- Nobody?
- I... I was kidding, too.

254
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,299
- That is funny.
- It's hilarious.

255
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,700
- That is so funny.
- That is so funny.

256
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,299
Oh! I...

257
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,299
- Oh, you got...
- Yeah.

258
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,900
- All right. So...
- Hey!

259
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,400
Okay.

260
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:45,400
Harsh.

261
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,599
- Hey, babe, you wanna party?
- I'm at a party.

262
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,799
Do you wanna make out with us?

263
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,900
Why don't you take a picture, Ian?

264
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,700
Yeah, and post it on
Totalfuckingawesomeness. com.

265
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,799
Backslash-we-rule!

266
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,000
Where'd you come up with that?

267
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:14,200
- Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
- You just did.

268
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,099
- Can I ask you another question?
- You just did again.

269
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,299
- What's up? What's up?
- What's up, what's up?

270
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,900
- Dude, where you going?
- Dude, come on. Be a buddy.

271
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,099
- I'm... All right, all right.
- You got to get over the monkey.

272
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,299
Where do you guys get the confidence to,
like, hit on every girl you see?

273
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,000
- 'Cause we're the shit.
- Yeah, you oughts to know that, bitch.

274
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:41,500
- So where's Felicia?
- Fel-ate-cha. Yeah.

275
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,900
- She's in...
- Fe-lay-cha! You banging her?

276
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,299
We're just friends.

277
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,900
- I'm uncircumcised.
- Fuck off!

278
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,799
Wait, I thought you took her to prom.

279
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,799
Yeah,
but it was a just-friends kind of thing.

280
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,299
You should bang her. We would.

281
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
Dude, we would bang her so hard.

282
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:06,299
Yeah, tell her we'll bang her for you
if you're not into it.

283
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:07,700
Yeah. Hard.

284
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,000
- With our dicks!
- Yeah, our dicks are huge.

285
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:11,099
You could see them from space!

286
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,900
- What's up?
- What's up?

287
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,900
I'll call you from nationals.

288
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,799
- Say it.
- You're my little donut girl.

289
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,700
- Bye, sexy.
- Yo, Ian.

290
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,599
- You want to smell my finger?
- Yeah, okay.

291
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:47,400
Are you sure you got the right hole?

292
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,500
Awesome.

293
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,599
Hmm... '69.

294
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,099
Whoa.

295
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Don't puss out. Be cool.

296
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,099
I don't know.

297
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,299
That is a long drive, my sugar biscuit!

298
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Sugar biscuit? God, I suck at this.

299
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
Holy buckets.

300
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,500
She wants me to give her the D.

301
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
Well, honey

302
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,799
What ya got, Mr. Mans?

303
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,299
I got a lot of money

304
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,299
I don't see no keys in my hands

305
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,200
I just wanna nasty girl

306
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,000
Now tell me, is that nasty girl you?

307
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,299
Do you like what you see?

308
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:23,900
Could you be my nasty girl
and let me do that dirty dance with you?

309
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,099
I can love you long time

310
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,200
I like 'em all in shapes and sizes

311
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,400
And it don't make no difference to me

312
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,799
If you're short, tall, big or small
Long if there ain't no big surprises

313
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,099
Chances are you'll suit me to a T

314
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,500
Dad, what did you do with my helmet?

315
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Ian, honey,
I made you some tollhouse cookies.

316
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:30,299
I'll just leave these here for you.

317
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,900
I'll get them later.

318
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,200
There's $40 in the cow for fun money,

319
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,599
so be safe and sorry I didn't knock.

320
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:45,900
Anytime. It's your home now.

321
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:48,599
Oh, dear.

322
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,000
- Dude.
- Hey.

323
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,700
What is going on with you?
You bought rubbers?

324
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,299
- How did you know that?
- It's on Russ Miller's blog.

325
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,500
Jesus! That was, like, 11 minutes ago.

326
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:09,200
What's the deal? Dude.

327
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
She wants me to meet her tonight
at the Big Boy in Knoxville.

328
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,799
Seriously, dude, pack your shit.
We're going to Knoxville.

329
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,000
No. Stop it. Put these back.

330
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:18,799
This is the type of girl who has...

331
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,599
She has it shaved into a landing strip.

332
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,400
I can't deal with a landing strip.

333
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,099
Okay, dude, you don't know that. I mean,
she could have anything under there.

334
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,700
There could be a little Hitler
or just a full, nasty Chewbacca.

335
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,700
You know, she doesn't even want me.
She wants him.

336
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,599
I'm sorry. This is good. This is fine.

337
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,799
I mean, that looks like you. Like the eyes.

338
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:44,599
Tasty's probably a guy, anyway.

339
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,400
Maybe. But what if she's not?

340
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,099
You know, I mean, look, you've already
opened, and I could help you close.

341
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,299
We just need one thing.

342
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,400
Ian, just look at this.
I mean, you roll up in a '69 GTO,

343
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,099
she's gonna drop an egg right there
in the Big Boy parking lot.

344
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Hey, Ian, come give me a hand with this.

345
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,299
Here. Strap that end down. Tight.

346
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,099
- The cord's too short.
- Put a little sack into it, powder puff.

347
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
- All right. Thanks, little brother.
- Yeah.

348
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,200
- Hey, Ian.
- Yeah.

349
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,099
Did I hear something
about you wanting to borrow my car?

350
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,599
No, no, it's fine. Thanks. Thank you.

351
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,099
You sure?

352
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,599
You're my little brother, Ian.
All you gotta do is ask.

353
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,099
Okay.

354
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,700
Could I use The Judge this weekend?

355
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,500
Ow!

356
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Fuck-stick, I wouldn't let you drive
The Judge if it was parked on my shnuts.

357
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,200
- Let's go, Dad.
- What a dick.

358
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:01,099
You should take his car just on principle.

359
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,400
What do you want me to do, you know?

360
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,099
I mean, I doubt I can hot-wire it,
since I don't even know what that means.

361
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,700
What are you doing?

362
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,500
No. Lance, no! Put it back.
Did you just hear him? Please.

363
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,799
Come here, we're gonna have a talk.

364
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:18,799
She's only nine short hours away.

365
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,200
We're gonna head down there tonight
and you're gonna pound on that va-J.

366
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:24,000
Who's gonna pound on it? Say it.
Ian's gonna pound on it.

367
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:26,799
We're back tomorrow
before Rex even knows the car is gone.

368
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,400
Now, listen, these girls at Madison are
gonna be fucking at a college level.

369
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,299
I need you ready for that.

370
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Wait! Put it... Put it back.

371
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,299
Back here.

372
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,099
For God's sake. You two rump rangers
couldn't wait five minutes?

373
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,700
Shit.

374
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:24,799
- Shit!
- Fuck!

375
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,400
I told her she could stay here this weekend.

376
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,299
What the hell?
Why are you driving Rex's car?

377
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,000
I thought me and...

378
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:37,700
- Are you bitching out on me?
- No.

379
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,000
- No.
- No.

380
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:41,799
Good. Well, then where are we going?

381
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:45,000
Um... Knoxville, Tennessee.

382
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,000
Okay. I'm gonna go tell my mom.

383
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,900
Okay. Are you gonna... Awesome.

384
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:53,599
Dude, what the fuck?

385
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,500
- I don't want her along.
- Really?

386
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,700
You don't want to bring Yoko
on your sex trip?

387
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,099
Yeah, no shit.
She's always cock-blocking you.

388
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,700
No, she isn't. She doesn't even have a...

389
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,000
Okay, twat blocking.

390
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,200
Professor.

391
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
When will you
be coming back?

392
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:08,700
No, tomorrow.

393
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,799
- When?
- No. Bye! God.

394
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,200
You guys
drive safe now. Bye!

395
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,500
So, what's in Tennessee?

396
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,900
My grandma has got some cancer.

397
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,599
- Grammy K?
- She's fine.

398
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,900
She's gonna live forever. Well, a long time.

399
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,000
It's, you know... I mean, what is it called?

400
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:31,200
- It's foot cancer.
- She's got a little foot cancer.

401
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,400
She'll be hopping around in no time.

402
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:36,299
So what's she doing in Tennessee?

403
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,000
Oh! Um... Well, there's this kick-ass
cancer center there.

404
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:44,900
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's like... It's famous.

405
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,299
- Yeah.
- So if you ever get any cancer,

406
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,099
you should totally check it out.

407
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,599
I would.

408
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,900
So you want I-80 East and then
65 goes all the way through Indiana.

409
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,900
- So how's it feel?
- What?

410
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,400
I don't know, breaking the rules,
talking some shit, driving The Judge?

411
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,799
It feels pretty good.

412
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw

413
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,099
I'm in the prime of my life

414
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:25,799
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives

415
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,599
This is our decision
To live fast and die young

416
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,299
We've got the vision
Now let's have some fun

417
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,099
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah

418
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:50,900
This dude wants to race.

419
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,000
Let's go, ladies.

420
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,799
Lance! Cut it out!
Come on, you don't know who's in there.

421
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,000
Dude, I don't care if fucking Steve McQueen's
zombie corpse is in that car.

422
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I refuse to be embarrassed by a car
that looks like a Trapper Keeper.

423
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:06,200
I am not racing in my brother's car.

424
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,299
Holy shit.

425
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:12,000
What the hell is that?

426
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:13,500
Whoa!

427
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,299
Looks like a Nachos BellGrande.

428
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,799
And a chalupa!

429
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,500
Medium Coke!

430
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,900
Go right!

431
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:24,200
Turn the wipers on!
- They are on.

432
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,900
They're not working!

433
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,900
Please, don't yell at me.
I'm doing the best I can.

434
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,299
- Winnebago!
- Where?

435
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,500
Winnebago! Winnebago!

436
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,099
Oh, my God, are you all right?

437
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:50,900
Yeah, nobody offer to help.
I got this under control.

438
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:02,799
- Are you all right?
- Do I look like I'm all right? Fuck!

439
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:09,900
You know what might make you feel better?
Putting 40 on pump two.

440
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Hey.

441
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:34,099
- Another one for the collection.
- Aw! Cool. Thanks.

442
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,900
What?

443
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,599
It's okay, Brandy. It's okay, baby, don't cry.

444
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,400
Lance, what are you doing?

445
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,400
Dude, you should be ashamed of yourself,

446
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,400
because I'm just trying to show
another human being a little compassion.

447
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
And my dick.

448
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,299
What have you got?

449
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,099
Hey, kid, where you from?

450
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,299
- I'm from Chicago, I mean, outside Chicago.
- Are you two married. No?

451
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:21,599
- No, we're just friends. We're amigos.
- Oh! You make a good couple.

452
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,500
She's pretty. Marry that girl.

453
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,400
You kids want to help yourself
to a can of Purple?

454
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,200
- Purple sounds great, Ian. Purple?
- Yeah, I can go...

455
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:39,200
- You ever had a peppermint fatty?
- No. Let's have that.

456
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,599
See how that shoe fits.

457
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:47,099
That is curiously strong.

458
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,099
I feel like my dick just got bar mitzvahed.

459
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,599
It actually says Purple Soda.

460
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Bad boy.

461
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:06,799
You like him, don't you?

462
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,599
- What? Who?
- Lance. I mean, he's the crush, right?

463
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,500
Oh, yeah! I like Lance, 'cause he's so hot.

464
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,500
I wanna have his baby, he's... Whatever.

465
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Brandy!
- Uh-oh!

466
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,299
Brandy! Shit.

467
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,200
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

468
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:43,099
Mr. McBroom. Ma'am.
Where the fuck's Brandy at?

469
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,799
- You ever hear of a rolling brown-out?
- No. Let's try it.

470
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,000
Wait, brown? No, no, nothing brown!
Nothing brown! Nothing brown!

471
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:07,500
What're you gonna do? Hit a girl?

472
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,900
No, but I'm gonna
pummel his ass real good.

473
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,400
There you go. There you go.

474
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,500
Brandy! Come on, baby!
Open the God damn door!

475
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,300
All right, this is not what it looks like.
It was a project for school.

476
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,500
Purple Soda!

477
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:40,900
Wiener!

478
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,800
Ow!

479
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,400
There you are.

480
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,599
Come on, come on.
I do not want to die naked.

481
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,300
Fuck you! Motherfucking son of a bitch!

482
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:25,800
Get on your feet, you motherfucking pussy!

483
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,699
Hey, hold on!

484
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,599
Come on, man, she's not worth it.

485
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:35,300
She's just gonna shit all over you.
Trust me.

486
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,900
Eat bat, dickhead!

487
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
Holy shit!

488
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,199
Ian just killed that guy.

489
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,400
Sir? Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

490
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,800
Look, I have my insurance card.
I'm sorry. We're from out of town.

491
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,300
I couldn't see you through the corn.
I'm sorry.

492
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,099
Where the hell's the road?
- It feels like left.

493
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,400
I told you we didn't have time for this,

494
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,699
- but all you care about is your stupid dick.
- Ian.

495
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,500
And you leave us out there
with her mom's weird soda.

496
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,900
- Ian.
- And her dad's balls in plain view...

497
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,099
Ian, Ian, whip a shitty!

498
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,699
Motherfucker!

499
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,500
Holy fucking shit! That's how you do that!

500
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:27,500
Oh, my God, Ian, amazing driving.
Lance, you suck!

501
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,000
Where the hell are we?
- Where are the Google maps?

502
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:32,599
- They're in my pants.
- Which are?

503
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,099
In the trailer.

504
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:39,000
Mmm-hmm. Great.

505
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,900
Shit. I got gum in my bush.

506
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:50,099
Hey, pick this guy up. Maybe he can
show us back to the highway.

507
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,800
- Ian, do not pick up a hitchhiker.
- Don't worry, I won't.

508
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,099
No, no, no.

509
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,300
Oh, my God.

510
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,500
Hey! Thanks for the lift, man.
I've been out there for hours.

511
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,699
Not one car. Can you believe it?

512
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,400
- Listen, sir, we didn't...
- You're good people.

513
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,199
- Guy, you're not wearing any pants.
- Yeah, I know.

514
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,599
Right on.

515
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,500
I got nothing. There's no bars.
You know, it probably just needs water.

516
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,300
Got any in the trunk?

517
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,099
Hey, sweetheart, men are talking.
We got this one.

518
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,199
Yeah, thanks,
but this happened to my brother's car once

519
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:39,000
- and you just piss in the radiator.
- Really?

520
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,800
Yeah.

521
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,199
Oh, God! Damn it!

522
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,500
- Are you okay?
- Fuck. Yeah.

523
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,300
That's a lesson learned.

524
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,800
You can watch,
if you're into that kind of thing.

525
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,300
Oh, wow, thanks, but I think we've all seen
your dick enough for one day.

526
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,199
- Do you hear that? There's a ringing.
- Your loss. It's like razor blades.

527
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:07,099
What? There's ants down here. FYI.

528
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:11,900
All right, you're up. Grip it and rip it.

529
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:15,900
Okay. Go away.

530
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,500
Dude, seriously? Still?
I thought you got over this shit.

531
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,500
You're a grown man.

532
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,400
Flowing river, gentle stream.
Flowing river, gentle stream.

533
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,900
- Yo, stage fright, how're we doing?
- Damn it, Lance, just give me a minute.

534
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,800
Excuse me.
We kind of need you to pee in the radiator.

535
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,500
- Why?
- We just do.

536
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Our new friend's got nothing left
in the tank.

537
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,599
What?

538
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,300
You kids need some help?

539
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,199
Hi.

540
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,599
Are you okay?

541
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:26,199
Oh, yeah, I'm great.
I just beaved a family of four.

542
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,599
Try it.

543
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:34,900
All set?

544
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,800
Look, I'm sorry, sir,
but we can't give you a ride.

545
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm gonna say this once.

546
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You unlock this fucking car,
or God is my witness,

547
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,699
I'll stake you all to the ground,

548
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,099
cut you open and let the dogs get at you.

549
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,599
Oh, yeah?

550
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,599
Bye-bye.

551
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,099
- Here's that pee you ordered.
- Roll them up.

552
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,300
- There you go, Tex.
- You're soaked with pee.

553
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,900
Quick car wash?

554
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,400
- God!
- Gross.

555
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,099
It smells like Halloween. Fuck.

556
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,199
How can nobody go down a road
for an hour and a half?

557
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,199
Why did they even make this stupid road?

558
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,300
It's so hot out here.

559
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,900
Ow!

560
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:43,699
Oh, my God, your head.
Wait... Does it hurt? Let me see.

561
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Yes. It hurts.

562
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:51,599
- What is that?
- Oh, my God.

563
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,199
Wow.

564
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,400
That is so beautiful.

565
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,400
Need some help?

566
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,900
- Yeah, but no offense...
- Oh, right, 'cause I'm Amish,

567
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
so I wouldn't know anything
about your '69 GTO Judge.

568
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,000
455 Big Block, Ram Air. 4-11 posi,
something like that.

569
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:38,099
Weird, that thing must have fallen
straight from space.

570
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,900
Well, good luck with the future ride,
spaceman.

571
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,699
Hey, dude, wait up. Hold on.

572
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,300
Wow!

573
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Okay.

574
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,800
What are you doing? Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Leesh, that's a bad idea.

575
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,099
- What?
- Come on.

576
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,699
You don't know how far we have to walk.
Those are your only pair of shoes.

577
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,000
You know what? You're probably right.
God, you're so sensible.

578
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:02,900
But maybe I should? Or maybe I shouldn't?

579
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,199
I should.

580
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,400
I can't believe you just did that.

581
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,800
- All right. Now you.
- No way. Forget it.

582
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,400
Dude, you never do anything crazy. Ever.

583
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,599
Hey! I'm driving halfway across the country
to go to...

584
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,199
To visit your grandma? Whoa!

585
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,400
So he met this chick on the Internet,
which is sketchy.

586
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,699
The Internet?

587
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,599
Yeah, it's like a series of computers
that are connected through...

588
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:32,000
Computers?

589
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:37,400
A computer's like a big calculator,
you know, with a screen.

590
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,900
I'm just busting your balls, man.
I know what the Internet is.

591
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,900
- Okay.
- You ever heard of Rumspringa?

592
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,300
Yeah, that ska band from Delaware.

593
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,599
No, it means "run wild." It's an Amish
tradition where when we turn 16,

594
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:54,199
we can go live like you heathens
for a while.

595
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,500
You go nuts, party for months or years
till your folks start hassling you,

596
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,900
and then it's back to the Stone Age.

597
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:04,000
But if you're on Rumspringa,
what's with the buggy?

598
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:06,300
Oh, no, I'm not. Not anymore.

599
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,800
I probably shouldn't even be
talking to you, but...

600
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,500
I'm a little bit of an Amish floutlaw.

601
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,199
- Sometimes I just miss the world.
- What do you miss the most?

602
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,400
You know, I miss sarcasm.
It's mostly lost on my people.

603
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,500
Oh.

604
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:26,699
And gambling. Went to Vegas once.
And butt fucking.

605
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,599
- Got a lot of nice memories there.
- I hear that.

606
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:33,900
You know, when you cut your foot on
a piece of glass,

607
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,400
- don't think I'm gonna carry you.
- You know what? I will be fine. Okay?

608
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,400
- I was born barefoot.
- Hey! Wait!

609
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,500
Hey! Stop!

610
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:50,199
Have a nice walk, shit-birds.

611
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,900
Oh!

612
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,000
Hey, Ian, Felicia, this is my boy, Ezekiel.

613
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,699
What up, English?

614
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:13,500
There's no service out here.

615
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,900
- I can't even tell her I'll be late.
- Good. That's perfect. Keep her waiting.

616
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You don't want to come off as desperate.

617
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,199
I'm driving nine hours.
How am I not coming off desperate?

618
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:26,300
- We had shit to do.
- Uh-oh! See that creamy stuff?

619
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,699
You blew your head gasket.
That's not good.

620
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,300
- Shit.
- Don't cry. We can fix it.

621
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,500
- Really?
- Yeah, really. We're good at it.

622
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:36,099
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I didn't mean to undersell it,

623
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,300
but it's an impressive thing.

624
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,199
- Yeah. We'll fix it.
- Wow, that'd be cool.

625
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,500
Yeah, would be cool, wouldn't it?
I might be the coolest guy you ever met.

626
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,800
- Wow.
- Wow.

627
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,400
- Thank you.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

628
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,099
That's what you say
when people do nice things for you.

629
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:52,199
You know, there's a pretty big shindig
shaping up next door

630
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,300
if you guys want to hang there
while we work on it.

631
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,900
Take it easy while we do all this for you.

632
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,400
- Does he have an attitude?
- No, he's fucking with you.

633
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:06,199
Okay.

634
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,599
Just relax, man.
I got a good feeling about this, you know.

635
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:13,099
You're gonna party with the Amish.

636
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,199
Yeah, I'm sure it's gonna be
one kick-ass quilting bee.

637
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,699
What's up, man?

638
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,800
- Hey.
- No f-ing way!

639
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,000
When I'm home alone
I just can't stop myself

640
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,099
- This is insane!
- I know.

641
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:45,300
Signing off, " I'm all right in bed,
but I'm better with a pen"

642
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,400
I'm all right in bed, but I'm better with a pen

643
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:56,199
I'm all right in bed, but I'm better with a pen

644
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,199
The kid was all right, but it went to his head

645
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:15,500
Thank you, guys, very, very, very much.
You guys fucking rule, man.

646
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,099
Dude. Don't even bother.
Your game is not gonna work on that girl.

647
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,500
What do you know about girls?
I've never even seen you with a girl.

648
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:42,500
I'm gonna go check on the car.

649
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
Yeah, fuck it. Let's dance.

650
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,199
- Bite me. I'm not your consolation prize.
- Come on. Don't be hating.

651
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,400
Fine.

652
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,300
I've never shot a flaming
arrow that far, but I was game to try.

653
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,699
And the thing is,
the second you let it release...

654
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,500
Whoa! Hey, what is this?
Why are the seats out?

655
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,900
Ian, do you know anything
about fixing these old Pontiacs?

656
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,000
I don't care, okay?
Ezekiel, take all the pieces and just

657
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:34,199
- put them back in there. I don't want...
- Ian, you've gotta calm down.

658
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,599
Do you know any breathing exercises?

659
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:37,800
Because you are right on the verge
of a freak-out.

660
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,699
You don't know my brother, okay? He's
gonna fuck my ass with a roll of quarters.

661
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,400
What? He's gonna what? With what?

662
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,199
Oh, yeah! He's gonna go get off work early,
and he's gonna walk into the bank,

663
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,400
stand in line, change a 10,

664
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,400
find my ass and just fuck it
with a roll of fucking quarters.

665
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:41,400
Check it out. It's totally working.

666
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,699
You're the best wing-man ever.

667
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,300
She's in, she's in. Watch this.

668
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,000
Rumspringa! Whoo!

669
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,199
- I took a wicked digger.
- Yes, you did.

670
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,000
- First day of Rumspringa?
- Rumspringa!

671
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,599
- Uh-oh!
- Oh!

672
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,400
Hey.

673
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:24,199
- All right. Okay. You good? All right.
- Aw! You guys are so nice.

674
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,300
Don't let her step in it.

675
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,599
What? What's wrong with you?

676
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,599
- Yeah, what's your problem, bitch?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

677
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,000
Nothing. She's fine. God, lay off.

678
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,500
- It's Lance, right?
- No.

679
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,900
I'll bet he's in there with that Amish girl
and you're out here.

680
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Wrong.

681
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:47,900
Come on, Leesh, just drop
the hard-ass thing for two minutes.

682
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,599
You know. It's okay. You're into Lance.

683
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,500
- God, I'm such an idiot.
- Look, there's something about Lance.

684
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:02,900
Everybody likes Lance. I like Lance.

685
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:07,599
Just promise me
you won't ever be like Lance.

686
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:14,099
What is wrong with us?
Let's go have some fun. Come on.

687
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:16,599
- No. No.
- No?

688
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:22,099
Come on, we're young, and we're Amish,
and it's Rumspringa.

689
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:23,500
Rumspringa!

690
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,699
Ian, you little cock-sucker!

691
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:14,599
Ah!

692
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:17,400
Leesh, you're so stubborn.
Look at your feet.

693
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,800
They are fine. All right?

694
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,500
Hey. What's the plan?

695
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,800
I might as well find a phone and call Rex

696
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:32,599
- so he can get on with killing me.
- What about visiting your grandma?

697
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,300
Yeah, dude. You been putting off
visiting your grandma for too long.

698
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,599
- It's about time you visited Grandma.
- Yeah.

699
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:44,900
Lance, you know,
I really do want to visit my grandma, but...

700
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,900
Dude, I really can't stress enough how
much you're gonna enjoy visiting Grandma.

701
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:53,800
You know, I visit my grandma sometimes
two or three times a week,

702
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,199
and it is always a pleasure.
She's just a delight.

703
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:58,300
What am I supposed to do?

704
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,599
Our transportation is all over the floor
of that barn.

705
00:52:00,699 --> 00:52:02,000
Hey, Mary!

706
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,400
Hi.

707
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:12,500
Wow, you look beautiful.

708
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,199
Oh, please.

709
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:19,500
I mean, seriously, you wearing that,
churning some butter. Sexy.

710
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,300
So I had the best time with you last night.

711
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,800
Yeah, me, too.

712
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,699
So you got my number.
You're gonna call me, right?

713
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,099
No.

714
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,000
"No." You're funny.

715
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:39,500
I mean, Lance, I really like you,
but Rumspringa's over for me.

716
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,099
- So...
- Rumspringa!

717
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,000
Sorry.

718
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,199
You fixed it?

719
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,699
Yeah, we hit a few snags,
but she's banging like a champ now.

720
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,699
Man, I don't even...
I don't even know what to say here.

721
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:26,099
You know, I don't really have much...

722
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:28,000
Oh, no, we're good. We're good.

723
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:31,099
I mean, the opportunity to help a neighbor,
that's a gift.

724
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:35,400
Man, you're too... Here, thanks.
Thank you so much.

725
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,099
- You're welcome.
- Thank you, it's really cool.

726
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:39,199
It is. You know, I mean,

727
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,599
if you felt the need to reciprocate
in some way,

728
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:45,099
I mean, there's a lot of chores
that need to be done around here.

729
00:53:45,099 --> 00:53:49,199
Yeah, no, the only thing about that is
we're kind of behind schedule right now.

730
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,300
Yeah, but, I mean,
we could totally come back.

731
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,699
- We could hit you on our way back through.
- Okay.

732
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,400
Yeah, you should.
You should really get on the road.

733
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:01,300
I mean, you got a smooth-running
vehicle now, you know, 'cause we fixed it.

734
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,199
- Yeah. No, but it's... So we're good?
- We're good. Yeah, technically.

735
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,300
We'll come back. I promise.

736
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,699
- I'm looking forward to that.
- Hey, no, seriously, we will.

737
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,199
Okay. We'll all hold our breath
till you get back.

738
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,400
On three, guys. Three, two...

739
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:30,199
My stomach's killing me.
Tell me if you see a rest stop.

740
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:53,099
Fuck. I know you didn't take my car, Ian.

741
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:55,099
'Cause you're a big, giant pussy.
That's right.

742
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:57,199
That's why. It's here, isn't it?

743
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,900
Want some of this?

744
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,900
Shit!

745
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,599
Hey, Knievel, what say you get
your bike out of the fricking road?

746
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:29,199
Hey! Hey!

747
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,599
All ocupado, eh, sport?

748
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,500
Gents.

749
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:57,400
Well, looks like we're up.
Go on, get in there.

750
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:07,199
Oh!

751
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,699
Am I getting a signal?

752
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,500
Tasty, I got sidetracked last night.

753
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,599
I had to party with some new homies.

754
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,500
Tonight, 8:00 p.m. at Big Boy.

755
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,000
I'm worth the wait.

756
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Yes!

757
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,099
No! Oh, God! No, thank you! No, thank you!

758
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,000
Little buddy? Hello? Hello.

759
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,400
- Was that you screaming in there?
- I don't want to talk about it. Ever.

760
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,500
- Where's Felicia?
- She went to get corn dogs.

761
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,199
Can you believe
the girls around here, man?

762
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:35,300
But, man, where am I ever gonna find
another girl as cool as Mary?

763
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,699
You like it?

764
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:47,000
- What about Felicia?
- What about her?

765
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,199
- She's into you.
- Yeah, no shit. Get in line.

766
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,000
What is that?
She's not good enough for you?

767
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,000
Felicia's awesome,

768
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:02,199
but the obvious statement to make here
is that you like her.

769
00:58:03,099 --> 00:58:07,599
- What? No, I...
- You're shocked. You can't believe it.

770
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:12,099
- This bombshell. Come on.
- You know, she's not into me anyways.

771
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:16,199
Yeah, I know. But it doesn't matter.
I still... I could never do that to you.

772
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,400
Okay, but you do know
that she's not into you, right?

773
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,900
- Yeah. Well, maybe you don't know.
- No. No, no, I'm gonna stop you.

774
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,500
There's no maybe. Okay?
And I'm saying this as your best friend,

775
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:36,199
but never. Never fucking ever. You know?

776
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:37,500
Because you guys are friends.

777
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,300
You know what every girl
I've ever banged had in common?

778
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,900
I wasn't friends with any of them.

779
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,500
And they all had gorgeous teeth.
I'm into that.

780
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:54,000
Real simple.
Climb the rope, hit the bell, win a prize.

781
00:58:54,099 --> 00:58:57,599
Hey, there, Bilbo Baggins,
there's no height requirement.

782
00:58:57,699 --> 00:59:00,400
Why don't you step up
and win your girlfriend a prize?

783
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,800
Uh... We're not... She's not my girlfriend.

784
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:07,000
- What about your other girlfriend there?
- Nice.

785
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,400
All right, come on, Ian. You can do it.

786
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,699
Come on, you're almost there!
You're almost there! Go, go, go!

787
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,699
Winner! Winner! Winner!

788
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,400
- That was awesome.
- How the hell did you do that?

789
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,699
We had one of these at Cub Scout camp.
I kind of mastered it.

790
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
Yeah, you think you're hot shit?

791
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,800
- Lolly?
- Thank you.

792
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,199
Hey, hey, hey, ass.

793
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,800
Hey. What's your secret?

794
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,699
You just...
If you keep your shoulders down...

795
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,400
- No coaching.
- What?

796
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,199
No coaching there, Lombardi.
Read the sign.

797
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
No coaching.

798
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:10,800
Cheese and rice!

799
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,400
Oh.

800
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,099
- Thanks. I'm Sandy.
- I'm Ian.

801
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:19,000
- Hi.
- Hey.

802
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,199
- Consolation prize?
- Wow! Thank you so much.

803
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:29,900
You know, my dance team's performing
over at the tent in a couple of minutes.

804
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,400
You guys should come watch.

805
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,300
- Actually, we were just about to go.
- That sounds super fun. He'll be there.

806
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,000
Great. See you.

807
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:39,500
Dude, that girl reeks of sex.

808
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:44,699
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me

809
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,599
Why don't they just let me live?

810
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,800
I don't need permission

811
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,800
- Do we really have time for...
- Hey, hey.

812
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,500
You have to stop doing that to him.

813
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:56,500
- Doing what?
- Twat blocking.

814
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:59,699
I'm not twat... Doing that.

815
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:12,900
Yeah! Let's give it up for the AX Dancers!

816
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,400
Come on, girls,
let's help me get some fellas up in here.

817
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:20,500
- Ian.
- Oh, no. Please.

818
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:22,599
Get up there. Come on.

819
01:01:22,699 --> 01:01:24,000
Come on!

820
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,599
In the back! In the back!

821
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,000
Yeah!

822
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:37,199
Come on, two more, two more! Yeah!

823
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,900
Dude, turn around.

824
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:55,599
Look at this fine crop
of handsome fellas I got here.

825
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,000
But before we get down to business,

826
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:01,599
there's a young woman here

827
01:02:01,699 --> 01:02:04,699
who would like to share her story
with these young men.

828
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,800
- Kristy, you ready, baby?
- Okay.

829
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,900
So, last year I was at a dance
with my boyfriend.

830
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,099
He wanted to go to his car.

831
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:20,000
So I did.

832
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:26,000
So we were both naked in the back seat
and we started having oral...

833
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,900
Yeah!

834
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,699
Daddy likes that!

835
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,599
Excuse me!

836
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,400
Excuse me!
Is this tragic story turning you on?

837
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:10,599
This courageous young lady pours
her heart out and this is getting you hot?

838
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,599
It's time for you to pledge. Right now!

839
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:17,000
Boy, you need this more than anybody.

840
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,500
Hey, keep a wrinkle in it, captain.

841
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,500
I can't believe you took
a fucking abstinence pledge with a hard-on.

842
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:27,699
It's classic.

843
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,000
Look, I didn't even know what she was
talking about. That doesn't count! Okay?

844
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:32,900
- Ian! Hey!
- It gets better.

845
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,900
I am so proud of you!

846
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,000
Get away from me. Is that what you do?

847
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:40,400
You go out and you lure little dorks like me
into your little no-having-sex club?

848
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,500
Ian, it's not like that at all.

849
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:45,199
Just go away. Now.

850
01:03:49,099 --> 01:03:52,000
- I would've blown you, you know.
- Really?

851
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:53,199
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

852
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:56,300
You can keep your stupid
flipping lollipop, anyway!

853
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,300
- You are dead, psycho-virgin!
- No, no!

854
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

855
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,300
Hey, are you sure you want to get
dental work done in Floater, Kentucky?

856
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,300
Dr. Teddescoe will be with you present-like.

857
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,800
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

858
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,099
Fine, okay, you were right.
My feet are killing me,

859
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:34,800
and I never should've tossed my shoes.

860
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:39,000
No, come on.
I love that your shoes are in that tree.

861
01:04:41,699 --> 01:04:44,699
I do. That's premium Felicia.

862
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,300
Oh.

863
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:54,400
- So what'd you do to her?
- Hmm?

864
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,699
Smack her around a little bit?

865
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,900
She gets out of line, you pop her one?

866
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,599
- No. No, sir, I...
- I got you. I'm just teasing you, man.

867
01:05:01,699 --> 01:05:03,300
We have fun.

868
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,900
- He didn't, though, did he?
- Hmm? Mmm-mmm.

869
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,900
Be back in a couple minutes.
I'm gonna wait for that to numb up.

870
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,300
Mmm-hmm.

871
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,400
Hands to yourself, O.J.

872
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,400
Ian, you know the other night
at Lance's party?

873
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:25,199
- Was I there?
- No, come on.

874
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,599
Here.

875
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:38,000
I mean, you know the only reason is
because I don't want to ruin our friendship.

876
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:43,500
Totally, I mean friendship is awesome.
Good call.

877
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,900
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.

878
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,099
- You won't.
- What are you thinking about?

879
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,599
- What are you thinking about?
- I asked you first.

880
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,099
You got a little loogie.

881
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,199
I'm gonna go see if Lance...

882
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,300
Mmm-hmm.

883
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,000
Go. Go.

884
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:35,699
Um, I'll take these as well.

885
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,500
They're not for me. They're not.

886
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:56,000
- Heads up.
- What's with you?

887
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,099
I'm thinking maybe we head back home.

888
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,900
What? Why?

889
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,599
Well, Felicia and I were talking in there,

890
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:09,400
- and we kind of had a moment.
- Oh! Oh, did you guys have a little moment?

891
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,099
- Yeah.
- You're a moron.

892
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:14,199
Fuck you. We've talked about this.

893
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,699
Look, we're almost there,
and I'm not letting her do this.

894
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,800
We're going to Knoxville,
and you're getting your nut.

895
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,599
No, I'm not. I'm not.

896
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:26,500
No, I'm gonna text Tasty,
and I'm gonna tell her I'm not coming.

897
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:29,800
- Ian, get in this car.
- I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

898
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:34,800
Shit, where's my phone?
Hey, you got a new smile.

899
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,199
You have my phone. I didn't know...
This is for you.

900
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:41,300
Mmm! A message came in.

901
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,300
Your grandma says she's really excited
to see you.

902
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,699
And something about her hot,
shaved pussy.

903
01:07:46,699 --> 01:07:48,099
Must be the cancer talking.

904
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,199
All right. Good deal.
We're going to Knoxville.

905
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,699
All I've got is frustration, frustration

906
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,300
I hate this vacation

907
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,500
So, give up, give up
Give up, give up

908
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,199
I've got to get away from here
It's killing me just thinking 'bout

909
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:16,600
Frustration, frustration
I hate this vacation...

910
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,100
Ian, you're going the wrong way.

911
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:21,300
- We're going home.
- What?

912
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:24,899
Please, do not turn around
because of me. Okay.

913
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,300
- Yeah, no shit.
- I'm dying to see Ms. Tasty.

914
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:28,699
This is going to be hilarious.

915
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,300
A hundred bucks says she has a wiener.

916
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,199
Look, I said we're going home.
I don't want to talk about it.

917
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,899
I knew you'd find some way
to fuck this up for him.

918
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,399
Me? You two are fucking scheming
behind my back.

919
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:41,800
- No, we're not.
- Okay. You stole Rex's car.

920
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:43,600
You drove halfway across the country.

921
01:08:43,699 --> 01:08:46,600
This must be what you want to do.
So do it, chicken shit!

922
01:08:46,699 --> 01:08:49,100
- Fucking A, chicken shit.
- Fine! You know what?

923
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:52,199
I'll turn the car around, I'll flip a bitch,
and I'll go pork somebody. Right now.

924
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,699
I'll be that guy. Is that what you want?

925
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,600
- Be that guy! That guy rules.
- Sounds awesome.

926
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:59,300
- That would make me so happy.
- All right. All right. Fantastic! I'm doing it.

927
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:02,399
Watch out, Ian! Fuck!
- Watch it, Ian!

928
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:05,600
Whoo!

929
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:09,399
- You like that?
- Did your fucking balls just drop?

930
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,000
Holy shit, Ian.

931
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:18,600
- Oh, man, it's this douche again.
- You want it? You got it.

932
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:21,699
- Hold on to your pantyhose.
- Okay, we gotta work on your banter,

933
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,000
but otherwise, this is awesome.

934
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:29,699
- You're losing him.
- No, I got him. I got him.

935
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,800
- Jesus, Ian! Not so close.
- God damn it!

936
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,399
No way, man! You're dead.

937
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,300
Sorry. He's all right.

938
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:49,500
This guy's fucking dangerous!

939
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,699
Where is he? Talk to me, dudes.

940
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,399
Right up our ass. He's in our ass.

941
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,300
- He's tagging out.
- Ah! Ladies!

942
01:10:07,399 --> 01:10:08,399
Ian, look out!

943
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,899
Oh! Oh!

944
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,199
God damn it.

945
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:22,699
What were you doing, man? Shit.

946
01:10:24,199 --> 01:10:26,800
Dude, take it easy. This wasn't your fault.
He jumped right in front of you.

947
01:10:26,899 --> 01:10:29,800
Just shut up, Lance. Of course it's my fault.

948
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:31,600
Now, come on, man,
this possum's not gonna fuck you.

949
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:33,300
We gotta go find Ms. Tasty.

950
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:37,699
He's suffering, Lance. I'm not gonna
leave him here by himself. Okay?

951
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,699
Okay. You're right.

952
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,100
We gotta help him.
We gotta call a vet or something.

953
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:52,500
Ian, look at him.
There's not a lot that we can do.

954
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,800
You guys'll probably want to back up.
This'll probably stink like shit.

955
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,100
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm gonna take him out of his misery.

956
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:03,600
They don't make little wheelchairs for him.
He's done, man.

957
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,000
Fuck you, Lance.
God, you don't even give a shit about him.

958
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,199
I'll do it.

959
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,699
I'm sorry.

960
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,600
All possums go to heaven.

961
01:11:27,899 --> 01:11:34,100
Uh... Ian. It... I think it's still...

962
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,199
Shit.

963
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,300
Oh, no.

964
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:49,300
Ian, I'm so sorry, it's...

965
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:55,399
Oh, God! Jesus fucking... God damn it!
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

966
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,699
- He's really hanging in there.
- God! Fuck!

967
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:06,699
You guys ever listen to Sonic Youth? I've
been on a big Sonic Youth phase lately.

968
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:10,300
You know, their bass player's a woman.

969
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,699
We are in jail.

970
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,899
Okay, listen, you have got to be cool,
'cause if they see you shitting yourself

971
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
they're gonna fuck with us.

972
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,100
Hey! Hey, ladies.

973
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:43,000
Hey, how about you sit the fuck back down
before me and you have a problem?

974
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:46,699
How about you just chill out, man?
Be cool.

975
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,300
- All right. We good?
- Yeah, we're good.

976
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:06,000
- Excuse me.
- Listen, old man, I'm only gonna tell you...

977
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,000
You should've seen the look in his eyes.

978
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,399
His heart was breaking
for this poor little thing.

979
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,300
Shit, that boy Ian don't seem
like he got no balls at all.

980
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:22,000
Why? 'Cause he got to fussing some
over a suffering critter?

981
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,699
I think that's real sweet.

982
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,000
Well, I say this Lance,
he sounds like a real hunk of man.

983
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,500
But he got no respect for bitches.

984
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:36,100
Shathayd's right. No respect for bitches.
None whatsoever.

985
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,699
You love Ian, don't you, baby?

986
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,399
Well, it's just we've been best friends
since we were really little,

987
01:13:47,899 --> 01:13:51,300
and I don't know, he's the only person
I can really talk to, you know?

988
01:13:51,399 --> 01:13:57,000
When I was a girl, my best friend was
a fella named Creighton McDaniel.

989
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,600
We used to stay up all night just talking
and laughing and carrying on.

990
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:08,600
Then one day I got it into my head
that we ought to be more than friends.

991
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,899
So I tell him I love him.

992
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:13,899
What happened?

993
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,199
We dated for a few weeks.

994
01:14:19,899 --> 01:14:22,300
Then he met a gal over in Wofford.

995
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,100
We still talk from time to time.

996
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,899
But it was never the same between us.

997
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,300
Baby. Come here.
Come on, now. Come on, now.

998
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,600
You know you need a hug.
Come on, honey.

999
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,199
Cuddle up.

1000
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:56,699
Dude.

1001
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:01,800
- What?
- Look, you're pissing in front of everybody.

1002
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,199
Yeah, I am.

1003
01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:09,500
- And that guy's looking right at your dick.
- Atta-boy.

1004
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:17,899
- Look at you. You're a new man.
- No, I'm not.

1005
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:23,500
Dude. You stole a car, you got arrested,
you got in a prison fight.

1006
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,500
And now you're in here pissing
like a big dog.

1007
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,600
I mean, there's only one thing left.

1008
01:15:28,699 --> 01:15:31,899
Yeah, well, that's out.
I was supposed to meet her two hours ago.

1009
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,300
Dude, when we get out of here,
just tell her you got pinched.

1010
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,199
She'll think that's bad-ass, because it is.

1011
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:42,500
Lafferty, Nesbitt, your bail has been posted.

1012
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,600
Really?

1013
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,300
- Time to go.
- Shit!

1014
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:51,300
- What?
- Rex.

1015
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,100
Oh.

1016
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,100
All right, Duane, I'm gonna go to your
MySpace page and listen to your album.

1017
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:03,699
And I hope to see you soon
in better circumstances.

1018
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:15,800
- Hey.
- Mary!

1019
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,899
Wait. Wait. How did you find me?

1020
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,899
Well, I called your cell phone,
and then someone answered here.

1021
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,300
- That's awesome. Okay.
- Are you okay? Why are you in jail?

1022
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,000
I mean, there's a number of charges, but the
most prominent ones were animal cruelty

1023
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,100
and the assaulting the officer.

1024
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,000
But it's not nearly as bad
as it sounds on paper, okay? I promise.

1025
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,100
- Okay.
- Okay. Wait right here. Okay.

1026
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:46,000
- Teddy, Carol.
- Lance, my man.

1027
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,800
- You guys got my stuff?
- It's gonna be a few minutes.

1028
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,899
All right. I gotta put up with a lot here.

1029
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I was raped last night.
I'm just fucking with you.

1030
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,899
Oh, man. But one guy did get raped.

1031
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:27,500
You can't know, oh, no
You can't know

1032
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:33,000
How much I think about you, no

1033
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,300
It's making my head spin

1034
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:44,000
Looking at you
And you are looking at me

1035
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:47,500
And we both know what we want

1036
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:54,500
So close to giving in

1037
01:17:54,500 --> 01:18:01,399
Ian, don't do this. No,
don't turn into Lance. You're a good guy.

1038
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,399
Yeah, well, that's why I'm still a virgin.

1039
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:09,199
So what if you're a virgin?
God, Ian, it's just sex. It's not...

1040
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:14,500
No, Felicia, it's not about the sex.
It's not. I'm weird.

1041
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,300
I'm the only virgin I know.
I need to get this done

1042
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,899
so everyone can just stop
freaking out about it.

1043
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,100
Look, I know you don't approve,
but I'm sorry, I just...

1044
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,100
I'm not going home a virgin.

1045
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,899
Then do it with me.

1046
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,100
What?

1047
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,600
Do it with me and not some stranger.

1048
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,100
We're friends so you know
you're not gonna get some, like,

1049
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:45,800
crabs or genital warts
or some pussing thing that's coming...

1050
01:18:45,899 --> 01:18:48,399
Wow, Leesh. That's hot!

1051
01:18:50,899 --> 01:18:53,500
You know what?

1052
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:57,100
I think I'd rather stay a virgin forever
than lose it on pity-sex.

1053
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,000
- I'm not talking about pity-sex.
- Then what are you talking about?

1054
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,199
I don't know. Sex.

1055
01:19:04,899 --> 01:19:10,899
It doesn't have to mean anything.
It doesn't have to jeopardize our friendship.

1056
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:12,300
Ah!

1057
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:15,100
Leesh, you know what?
Fuck the friendship!

1058
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,699
I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

1059
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,600
I can't be the guy that you're gonna talk to
about your boyfriends anymore. I can't...

1060
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,699
I can't be the guy who's gonna pick you up
in the middle of the night,

1061
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,699
and you're gonna cry to because
Derrick Dicottes found some other girl.

1062
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:34,399
And maybe I'm just being selfish here,
but it is not enough.

1063
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,899
Okay, so I'm gonna go out that door,
and I'm gonna go have meaningless sex

1064
01:19:37,899 --> 01:19:42,899
with some random, hopefully hot, hopefully
female person that I met on the Internet.

1065
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,800
Unless you've got something better
to say to me.

1066
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,000
That's what I thought.

1067
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,399
Check out time, dick-cheese.

1068
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,699
- Rex, how'd you find me?
- You ever heard of LoJack, cheese-dick?

1069
01:20:49,699 --> 01:20:50,800
Come here.

1070
01:20:50,899 --> 01:20:53,500
Burn that mother down, y'all

1071
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,300
Burn, baby, burn

1072
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:57,100
Disco inferno

1073
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:58,800
Burn, baby, burn

1074
01:20:58,899 --> 01:21:00,199
Burn that mother down

1075
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,100
Come on, Rex, wait. The girl...
The one I told you about from the Internet.

1076
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:06,600
She's right across the street, Rex.
She wants to do it with me and everything.

1077
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,399
Like I give a shit!

1078
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,100
Get your shit, queer-bait!
We're going home.

1079
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:24,800
Okay. Okay, fine.

1080
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:27,100
Now!

1081
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,100
It probably wouldn't have changed

1082
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:32,600
all these feelings
that I've been having lately anyway.

1083
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:36,699
What are you talking about?

1084
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,699
I don't know, Rex. You know, just feelings,

1085
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:47,300
curiosity about men.

1086
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,399
Oh, shit, Ian!

1087
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,800
I think you might be right.
I think I might be getting gay.

1088
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,500
Oh, God damn it. Oh, fuck!

1089
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,100
But I just haven't had
any luck with girls, Rex.

1090
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:11,100
No way! No way my little brother's
taking it in the chili ring.

1091
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:21,100
All right, you take the car,

1092
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,899
and you go bang a female woman
like the good Lord intended.

1093
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:26,699
You've got one hour!

1094
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,800
- Ian.
- Yeah?

1095
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,800
- Not up the butt.
- Right.

1096
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:02,399
Hey, man. You looking for somebody?

1097
01:23:06,199 --> 01:23:07,300
Ms. Tasty.

1098
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,300
Ian?

1099
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:19,000
Oh, my gosh! Hey.

1100
01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:22,100
I was sure you were standing me up.

1101
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,800
- But here you are. Look at you.
- See you.

1102
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,800
You look a little different than your picture.

1103
01:23:31,399 --> 01:23:34,800
Yeah, I know. I lost a lot of weight
'cause I had the runs... The flu.

1104
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,100
Well, you're mighty cute,
and your car is really pretty.

1105
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,300
Why don't you take me for a ride?

1106
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:53,000
So, Ms. Tasty, what's your real name?

1107
01:23:54,800 --> 01:24:00,600
- How about I tell you after?
- Yeah, sure.

1108
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,899
Works for me.

1109
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:18,399
... below the ocean
Where I wanna be

1110
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:20,500
She may be

1111
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,699
Way down below the ocean...

1112
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:27,899
- No, Mary, wait.
- What?

1113
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,399
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I mean...

1114
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,800
Nothing, I just... I really like you,

1115
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:43,000
and I don't want to ruin this. You know?

1116
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,699
But, hey, maybe you could come
to Chicago and we could hang out

1117
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:50,899
- and take it a little...
- No.

1118
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:54,500
Lance, it doesn't work like that.

1119
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,800
And, I mean, if I don't go back,
I'm gonna be shunned.

1120
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,500
I could never see my family again.

1121
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:11,399
- This Amish thing is a real motherfucker.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

1122
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,300
- Ian.
- Yeah.

1123
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:25,100
I think we should take our clothes off.

1124
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,100
Wow. Really? Right here?

1125
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:29,500
Mmm-hmm.

1126
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,000
No one's around for miles. Come on.

1127
01:25:33,699 --> 01:25:34,899
Okay.

1128
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:45,100
- What do you think?
- Ample.

1129
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,699
Mmm-hmm.

1130
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,399
I think we should take
your clothes off now.

1131
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,699
Yeah, maybe we should.

1132
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,199
- I don't play football!
- Okay.

1133
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,100
I... I really don't.
I mean, I don't even really watch football.

1134
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:04,300
I mean, I got all that stuff
from Friday Night Lights,

1135
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:07,300
which is a show. It's also a movie
starring Billy Bob Thornton.

1136
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:09,399
- I don't know if you saw it, but...
- Ian.

1137
01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:15,500
What? You think everything in my profile's
the God's honest truth? No.

1138
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,500
Now, come on, take your clothes off.

1139
01:26:20,899 --> 01:26:25,300
Look, there's this girl...

1140
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,800
Ian, this can be our little secret.
No one has to know.

1141
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,000
Now come here.

1142
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't do this with you.

1143
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:56,800
I'm kissing you,
and I'm thinking about somebody else.

1144
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,899
No, and I know that's a stupid thing to say.
I mean, she's not even...

1145
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,000
Oh, no, no, no. Ms. Tasty, please don't cry.

1146
01:27:07,899 --> 01:27:11,699
It's not a reflection of...
You're so pretty, like...

1147
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:14,100
You're laughing.

1148
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,100
Just take your fucking clothes off, asshole!

1149
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:21,600
Look, I'm sorry, okay.
I don't mean to lead you on here,

1150
01:27:21,699 --> 01:27:25,899
and I'll give you a ride home,
but I don't think that... What the fuck?

1151
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,100
You heard the lady. Strip.

1152
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:34,399
- Do you have any jacks?
- Yup.

1153
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,800
- I win.
- Oh! Again.

1154
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:40,399
Yup.

1155
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,600
- All right, just take your shirt off.
- Okay, good.

1156
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,899
You were right, Ian. '69 Judge.
You were worth the wait.

1157
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,899
- Please, no! Come on, it's not even my car!
- Oh, and good luck with the lady friend.

1158
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:10,600
Felicia. Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

1159
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,600
Now, listen. I got another car coming
any minute now, okay?

1160
01:28:15,699 --> 01:28:17,300
- Got it.
- So take me back to the Big Boy

1161
01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:19,800
- and get this goat over to Luis.
- Right.

1162
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:26,899
And where is Luis? 5th and Crescent!

1163
01:28:27,699 --> 01:28:29,899
- I fucking told you.
- I know where it is.

1164
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:33,500
Shit!

1165
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,500
Hi.

1166
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:56,100
- Hey, boys. You finally made it.
- What's up, Ms. Tasty?

1167
01:28:56,199 --> 01:28:58,699
What's up? What's up?

1168
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,399
- Damn, you're hot as fuck.
- Yeah.

1169
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,300
- We brought beers and rubbers.
- And some lotion for your tits.

1170
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:25,300
I can't believe I'm banging an Amish chick.
I mean, seriously, what are the odds?

1171
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,399
Oh, yeah! More of that.

1172
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,399
So, wait, you do want to party?

1173
01:29:36,199 --> 01:29:37,300
With us?

1174
01:29:37,399 --> 01:29:40,500
Yeah. I want us all to get naked and party.

1175
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,399
Get your ass out of the car, motherfucker!

1176
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:09,899
- Who the fuck are you?
- Holy fucking fuck-balls!

1177
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:14,399
Okay, my bad.

1178
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:16,000
Now, I thought you were someone else,
all right?

1179
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:21,500
You done fouled up my ride,
so I'm gonna have to take yours.

1180
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:23,500
Fuck that shit.

1181
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,500
Here you go. Pulls to the left.

1182
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:30,399
What the fuck, dumb-ass?

1183
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:36,500
Oh, shit!

1184
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:43,800
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, shit!

1185
01:30:43,899 --> 01:30:46,000
Hey, highlights, back it up.

1186
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,899
Bite my dick, asshole!

1187
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,100
Ow! What the fuck you do that for?

1188
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,199
Lance? What the fuck is going on?

1189
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,899
That's the son of a bitch I was looking for!

1190
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,600
Hey, guy. How'd you...

1191
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:08,600
- Found your computer maps, douche-bag!
- Okay.

1192
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,699
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Boat show,
you and your boyfriend bring it in here.

1193
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,100
I don't need no trouble right now.

1194
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,000
Let's go. Bring it in.

1195
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:21,100
- Bobby Jo, who the fuck is that?
- Who?

1196
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:23,600
- That!
- Son of a bitch!

1197
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,399
Come on, darling.

1198
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,800
- Shut up!
- Now, take it easy on the hair.

1199
01:31:29,899 --> 01:31:32,399
- Get down!
- Hey, hey, come on.

1200
01:31:32,699 --> 01:31:35,800
- All right, all right.
- Take your hands off her!

1201
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:50,500
Holy loud!
- People are in the vehicle.

1202
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,600
Please! No!

1203
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,600
- All right. Get back, man.
- Ian?

1204
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,500
Everybody just be cool.

1205
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,100
- Felicia, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1206
01:32:12,199 --> 01:32:15,199
Ian, give me the goddamn gun
before you shoot your dick off.

1207
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,500
- Rex, I got this.
- Ian!

1208
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:20,100
God damn it, Rex, I got this!
Do not fuck with me! Not now!

1209
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:24,300
Ease it back, man.
That donut ain't fucking around.

1210
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,199
Hands where I can see them.

1211
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:33,300
- Ian, dude, you're working the mouth.
- I don't give a shit!

1212
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:37,500
Okay. All right, sorry.
You're doing so good. Proud of you.

1213
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,199
I mean that. I don't say it enough.

1214
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:43,500
All right, you, corn-fed, you can
punch my friend Lance, but just once.

1215
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,800
- Dude! What the fuck?
- You nailed his girlfriend.

1216
01:32:46,899 --> 01:32:50,000
- Not exactly. I mean, it was...
- And he came all this way.

1217
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,600
All right. All right, fair enough.
Just not in the nuts.

1218
01:32:57,199 --> 01:33:02,399
- Oh, shit!
- Okay. Okay, all right.

1219
01:33:04,199 --> 01:33:09,000
What a punch.
I think my kids are gonna be retarded.

1220
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:10,899
You got a fucking cannon for an arm, dude.

1221
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,399
- Yeah, you got a little...
- Thanks. My ears are ringing.

1222
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,899
Stop it! I'm warning you!

1223
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:21,800
Come on, bro. You ain't gonna kill no one.

1224
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,800
Whoa!

1225
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:30,399
- Anybody can shoot a gun in the air, dude.
- I'll shoot you in the leg.

1226
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:32,300
Smoke that cock, Ian!

1227
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,500
I don't think you got the plums, boy.

1228
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,100
God!

1229
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,800
Okay. Okay.

1230
01:33:51,699 --> 01:33:54,500
Anybody can shoot someone
in the leg, dude.

1231
01:33:55,699 --> 01:33:59,000
- Give me the gun!
- Jesus, man, what do I got to do?

1232
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Don't move, asshole,
or you're a fucking stain.

1233
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:06,199
Okay.

1234
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:10,600
Holy shit, Ian. Right on!

1235
01:34:10,899 --> 01:34:13,199
Where do you think you're going, bitch?

1236
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,699
Cat fight!

1237
01:34:16,899 --> 01:34:20,699
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore

1238
01:34:20,699 --> 01:34:22,300
Damn you, whore!

1239
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:24,100
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1240
01:34:24,199 --> 01:34:25,800
Fuck you!

1241
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:32,300
And if I have to crawl upon the floor

1242
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:34,000
Come crashing through your door

1243
01:34:35,899 --> 01:34:42,199
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

1244
01:34:42,699 --> 01:34:44,800
Drop the weapon, donut man!

1245
01:34:46,199 --> 01:34:48,500
Okay, put your hands on your head!

1246
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,199
- Both hands, asshole!
- I can't move the other arm.

1247
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:56,000
- Who said that? Who said that?
- I can't move the other arm.

1248
01:34:58,899 --> 01:35:01,899
Sir, I'm not resisting. It's foam, sir.

1249
01:35:05,699 --> 01:35:09,500
The big Mexican won't go down!
Take the shot!

1250
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:11,899
- Holy shit.
- Jesus!

1251
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,800
Hold your fire! Hold your fire, okay?

1252
01:35:14,899 --> 01:35:18,699
He is not the bad guy! She is the car thief.

1253
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:23,300
Right there. The blond, in a belt for a skirt.

1254
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,100
Anything else?

1255
01:35:34,899 --> 01:35:37,800
Oh, yeah,
apparently there's a guy named Luis,

1256
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:40,899
and he has a chop shop
at 5th and Crescent!

1257
01:35:41,699 --> 01:35:42,800
Thanks.

1258
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,199
We were just banging that chick in our car.

1259
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:47,399
- Yeah, you mentioned that.
- Yeah, super hard.

1260
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:53,500
The boy did have some plums.
He had some plums.

1261
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,699
Hey, this is Rick.
He's played arena football.

1262
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,100
- Hi. I'm Mary.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

1263
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:00,899
That's a weird little dude you got there.

1264
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Are you guys hungry?

1265
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,199
Is this place open 24 hours?

1266
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,199
Thank you for coming for me.

1267
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,300
What were you doing in the back seat?

1268
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:16,500
Nothing. I was...

1269
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:20,600
- You were stalking me.
- No, I wasn't. I...

1270
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:25,800
Okay. Yeah, I was stalking you just a little.

1271
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,899
I just... I knew you were gonna do
something you were gonna regret, and I...

1272
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,100
Felicia. Why can't you just say it?

1273
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:44,000
- Why can't you?
- Well, I asked you first.

1274
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,800
Fine. I'll say it.

1275
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:04,000
- You love me.
- Fine.

1276
01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:08,100
You love me, too, then.

1277
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:19,000
Life is beautiful

1278
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,399
But it's complicated

1279
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:26,500
Thank God.

1280
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:31,000
We barely make it

1281
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,100
You fucking heifer.

1282
01:37:59,699 --> 01:38:01,300
- You fixed it!
- Yeah.

1283
01:38:01,399 --> 01:38:03,000
Don't lean on it.

1284
01:38:05,399 --> 01:38:07,699
I guess you get to live.

1285
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:10,500
- You guys are amazing.
- Thanks.

1286
01:38:10,899 --> 01:38:12,399
Let's talk seriously for a second.

1287
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:18,000
I figure with the parts and labor,
you know, out the door... 4,200.

1288
01:38:20,199 --> 01:38:21,399
Oh. Um...

1289
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:22,500
It's just a round number.

1290
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,000
Yeah. No, I didn't really...

1291
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,500
I don't know what to...

1292
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,199
I'm fucking with you, Ian. We're good, man.

1293
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:37,800
- Wait, I mean, you're serious?
- Yeah. I'm serious. We're good. No worries.

1294
01:38:37,899 --> 01:38:39,199
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

1295
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:40,300
- Thank you, man.
- It's what I live for,

1296
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:42,899
fixing other people's shit for free.

1297
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Yeah.

1298
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,899
- Hey.
- Straight home, pussy!

1299
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:59,399
- Dude, we got to go.
- Fucking piece of shit!

1300
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:03,199
You go on ahead.
I think I'm gonna stay here, kick it Amish.

1301
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:05,100
Dude, what are you talking about?

1302
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:08,699
I don't know, a little hard work,
fresh air, missionary position.

1303
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,300
It's a man's life.

1304
01:39:11,399 --> 01:39:13,100
- Sounds pretty good, you know.
- Yeah, it sounds...

1305
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:15,800
Come on, Lance. Get serious.

1306
01:39:20,199 --> 01:39:21,600
Come here.

1307
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:25,500
I gotta tell you, I'm impressed.
I'm proud of you, you know.

1308
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,600
You held out for a good one,
the one you wanted.

1309
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,800
And you fucking made it happen.

1310
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:37,899
But, please, I'm begging you,
go take that girl to visit Grandma.

1311
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,199
- All right.
- And when you do, don't...

1312
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:43,500
- Lance, I got it.
- Yeah?

1313
01:39:44,899 --> 01:39:46,000
Yeah.

1314
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:50,100
Okay. I think you might.

1315
01:39:50,699 --> 01:39:52,399
- See you.
- Bye.

1316
01:39:58,699 --> 01:40:02,600
Well, no, no, me, I never worry

1317
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:05,899
Because, me, I never try

1318
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:13,000
And I never care to hold onto
what I just couldn't kiss goodbye

1319
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:35,199
- Are you sure you're ready?
- Yeah.

1320
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:40,100
All right, well, come on, take them off.

1321
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,899
Let's do it.

1322
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:16,000
Fuck!
Don't start your fucking shit with me.

1323
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:19,199
You know what? Fuck you!
I want a divorce.

1324
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:22,300
A few weeks later,
I was Felicia's date to Tiffany's wedding.

1325
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:25,899
But this time,
it wasn't a just-friends kind of thing.

1326
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:31,000
And Rex did make my life hell for a while.

1327
01:41:31,899 --> 01:41:33,399
But that Thanksgiving,

1328
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:36,899
we finally found out
what's been up his ass all these years.

1329
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,800
I'm gay! And, so, that's it.

1330
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,800
By Christmas,
my dad got used to the idea.

1331
01:41:45,899 --> 01:41:48,899
And Rex is actually
a pretty great guy these days.

1332
01:41:48,899 --> 01:41:51,699
Yeah, now he only uses the word faggot
during rough sex.

1333
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:54,300
Karen and I want you to have this,
for Christmas.

1334
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:56,399
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.

1335
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,100
A juicer.

1336
01:42:00,199 --> 01:42:05,600
Oh, my gosh! That's so awesome.
Wow, I gotta get some fruit.

1337
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:07,199
Wow!

1338
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:12,699
Thank you, thank you.

1339
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,600
And on New Year's Eve,
Felicia and I finally visited Grandma.

1340
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,899
- Again?
- Really?

1341
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:21,600
Twice.

1342
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,699
Oh, that was awesome!

1343
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,000
- Hey, boys. You get some rest?
- Thanks, man. Thanks for fixing the bus.

1344
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,800
- A pleasure.
- Yeah, thanks for fixing our bus.

1345
01:43:19,899 --> 01:43:22,300
- Appreciate it.
- Thanks for playing that show for us, too.

1346
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:25,699
- Yeah, no worries.
- It was a nice five-song set.

1347
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:28,100
Yeah, what do you guys typically...

1348
01:43:28,199 --> 01:43:30,800
I assume you get compensated
very well for that.

1349
01:43:30,899 --> 01:43:33,699
- Must be a good living.
- Yeah, we do. I mean...

1350
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:36,699
Yeah, you know, I...
Gosh, if I was really to calculate

1351
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,899
what you'd lose if this bus
couldn't have gotten back on the road,

1352
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:41,199
if you couldn't have gotten to your shows,

1353
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:46,199
I imagine all those weeping teenage girls
outside, "I need to dance."

1354
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,899
Could we send you some pictures?
We don't really have cash or anything.

1355
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
- Some autographed photos?
- Or we could give you CDs.

1356
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,399
Yeah, we've got a lot of use
for that around here.

1357
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:56,699
There is a lot of work
that needs to be done around here.

1358
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,600
You guys are some strapping young lads.

1359
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:01,000
I don't know if we're really built for that.

1360
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:05,100
- Yeah.
- I can hear you.

1361
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:07,300
I'm just saying,
you guys put in a 20-minute show,

1362
01:44:07,399 --> 01:44:09,000
- we spent all night on the bus...
- Yeah.

1363
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:10,399
I mean, that was a lot of work.

1364
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:12,699
We could maybe try
to write a check later on,

1365
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,899
or like I said,
we could send you guys some CDs.

1366
01:44:14,899 --> 01:44:17,500
City folk are always trying to solve things
with money.

1367
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,699
It's the spirit of the community
around here.

1368
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:22,199
Lord, please bless this Fall Out Boy.

1369
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:25,000
Keep him safe on the road.

1370
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:28,199
Help him to aspire
to the heights of Jon Bon Jovi.

1371
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:29,399
- Help him to...
- Thanks.

1372
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,500
- Okay, thanks, man.
- Thanks, man. We gotta roll.

1373
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,500
- Amen.
- We gotta roll, man. Thank you very much.

1374
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,199
All right, boys.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

1375
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:38,199
I loved your penis on the Internet,
by the way.

1376
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:40,600
- Fucking asshole!
- You're a dick!

1377
01:44:56,500 --> 01:45:00,399
Say my name and his in the same breath

1378
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:03,899
I dare you to say they taste the same

1379
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,500
Let the leaves fall off in the summer

1380
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,699
And let December glow feel flames

1381
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:14,300
Brace myself and let go

1382
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:18,000
Start it over again in Mexico

1383
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,800
These friends, they don't love you

1384
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:25,600
They just love the hotel suites, now

1385
01:45:25,699 --> 01:45:28,699
I don't care what you think

1386
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:32,500
As long as it's about me

1387
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:35,800
The best of us can find happiness

1388
01:45:35,899 --> 01:45:39,000
In misery

1389
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:43,000
Said, I don't care what you think

1390
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:46,899
As long as it's about me

1391
01:45:46,899 --> 01:45:50,199
The best of us can find happiness

1392
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:52,100
In misery

1393
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:01,600
Oh, take a chance,
let your body get a tolerance

1394
01:46:01,699 --> 01:46:04,600
I'm not a chance,
but a heat wave in your pants

1395
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:07,199
Pull a breath like another cigarette

1396
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,800
Palms up, I'm trading 'em

1397
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:12,399
Trading 'em

1398
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,600
I'm the oracle in my chest

1399
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,899
Let the guitar scream like a fascist

1400
01:46:18,899 --> 01:46:20,600
Sweat it out, shut your mouth

1401
01:46:20,699 --> 01:46:22,500
Free love on the streets

1402
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:26,600
But in the alley and I ain't that cheap, now

1403
01:46:26,699 --> 01:46:29,699
I don't care what you think

1404
01:46:29,699 --> 01:46:33,699
As long as it's about me

1405
01:46:33,699 --> 01:46:36,800
The best of us can find happiness

1406
01:46:36,899 --> 01:46:40,100
In misery

1407
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:44,100
Said, I don't care what you think

1408
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:47,899
As long as it's about me

1409
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,100
The best of us can find happiness

1410
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:52,899
In misery

1411
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:09,000
Said I don't care just what you think

1412
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:12,600
As long as it's about me

1413
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:16,000
Said I don't care just what you think

1414
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:19,699
As long as it's about me

1415
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,300
Said I don't care, I don't care

1416
01:47:23,399 --> 01:47:27,000
Said I don't care, I don't care

1417
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:33,199
Said I don't care, I don't care

1418
01:47:33,699 --> 01:47:34,699
No, I don't

1419
01:47:34,699 --> 01:47:38,100
I don't care, I don't care

1420
01:47:38,199 --> 01:47:42,000
I don't care

1421
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:45,000
I don't care what you think

1422
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,600
As long as it's about me

1423
01:47:48,899 --> 01:47:52,100
The best of us can find happiness

1424
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:55,500
In misery

1425
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,100
Said I don't care what you think

1426
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:02,899
As long as it's about me

1427
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,500
The best of us can find happiness

1428
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:12,699
In misery

1429
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:06,300
This is a serious matter.

1430
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,800
Run for your life.

1431
01:49:07,899 --> 01:49:10,300
Oh, shit! You know what?
We see the fake balls on the table there.

1432
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:14,699
All right. We'll shoot another. Cut.
- Cut.
