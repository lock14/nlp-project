1
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:15,636
Okay, go ahead.

2
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:18,656
Can I see the sign-in
sheet, please?

3
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,661
Thank you.

4
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:24,476
M'am you need to
sign it right here.

5
00:00:26,556 --> 00:00:29,956
- Can I use the phone?
- Sure, go ahead.

6
00:00:41,556 --> 00:00:43,471
Hello?

7
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:47,236
I'm gonna do this
alone aren't I?

8
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:52,516
- How could you not be here?
- I don't need to be there.

9
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:55,916
I don't need to watch.

10
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:58,756
But, uh...

11
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:02,556
I packed all his
things for you.

12
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:04,876
What?

13
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:08,458
- Why would you do
that Ana? I don't...

14
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:11,036
I can't just throw them away.

15
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:15,516
Nothings gonna change.

16
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:18,024
Nothings gonna change.

17
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:21,556
This isn't gonna
bring him back.

18
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,075
None of this will
bring him back, Ana.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,916
You know it's... I'm
hanging up now okay?

20
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:31,276
Ana?

21
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:09,635
- Noun.
- Electricity...

22
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:12,995
- Color.
- Black.

23
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:17,435
Adverb.

24
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:30,235
Mom, do I have to go again?

25
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:38,315
Yeah we do.

26
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:41,115
Why?

27
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:46,675
Remember when we used to
go to the zoo together?

28
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:50,452
Yeah. We're going
to the zoo now?

29
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,510
No, Honey.

30
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:56,115
You know, the uh... Remember
those big gorillas...

31
00:04:56,235 --> 00:05:00,793
how they'd play behind the
glass and make faces at us?

32
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:02,430
And make us laugh?

33
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,675
- Remember that?
- That was fun.

34
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,955
But they always had to
stay in their cage right?

35
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,785
These people might
forget, they...

36
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,198
might think... oh, you know:

37
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:14,910
He's okay, he's a nice
animal. He just wants to play.

38
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,385
And they would let 'im out...

39
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,115
and terrible things
would happen.

40
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:23,714
Really?

41
00:05:24,154 --> 00:05:27,902
Yeah, the man's
an animal, Jesse.

42
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:30,874
To make sure people
won't forget that.

43
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:35,690
He's a monster and I
have to make sure...

44
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,589
people won't forget.

45
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:40,194
Okay.

46
00:06:08,394 --> 00:06:12,114
Can we stop this time?
Please can we stop?

47
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:15,674
Yeah, absolutely.

48
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:31,474
I think I'm gonna stay here.

49
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:39,074
Okay fine, I'm gonna get out.

50
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:27,394
Lock-It-Up mini-storage.

51
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,834
Yeah, it's him.

52
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:36,914
No.

53
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:41,194
No, after thirty days
it's gotta be cash.

54
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:03,554
Hear that? That's
your customer.

55
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:44,794
- What's going on?
- Take a guess.

56
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:54,793
I thought, I might need
another week. Okay?

57
00:08:58,113 --> 00:09:01,254
Look, let me make it
real simple for you.

58
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:03,633
If you don't pay
you can't play.

59
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,902
You have until tonight's
game to pay up.

60
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,708
Then it's over...

61
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:22,148
- What's that
supposed to mean?

62
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:24,273
Use your imagination! Over.

63
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:32,113
Chuck, come on man.
What if I...?

64
00:11:14,193 --> 00:11:17,313
Hang on, hang on.

65
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:25,353
All right, have fun.

66
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:29,855
Remember you can
look, can't touch.

67
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,633
Place a bid, place a bid
on everything.

68
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:40,113
Start at 50 bucks
- 55 -60...

69
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,993
70.
75.

70
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:47,193
80.
85.

71
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:49,972
85. All right,
you're the winner.

72
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,233
Fill out at the top, please.

73
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:58,673
Okay, here it is...

74
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:06,993
- That's it?
- That's it.

75
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:12,513
250.

76
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:16,032
250?
Yeah...

77
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:20,250
Come on, I need
more than that.

78
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:22,255
I'm sure you do.

79
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:25,552
250.

80
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:31,272
You know what, take it.

81
00:13:02,592 --> 00:13:06,432
Girls, stay in the car.

82
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:07,384
Harry...

83
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,912
Well this certainly
explains a few things.

84
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,220
Yeah, it was just uh, bunch of
stuff that would've been...

85
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:16,947
auctioned anyways.
Bunch of junk.

86
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:20,211
So you're not stealing from
our customers, really.

87
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,307
Just me.

88
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:23,552
Look, I uh...

89
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:27,910
I'll pay you back... all
right? All of it, I promise.

90
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:29,915
Your word on that right?

91
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:35,872
There's no such thing as
selective honesty, Saul.

92
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:40,804
I want you out by morning.
I don't care where you go.

93
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:44,432
But I want you out before
opening, tomorrow morning.

94
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,272
Or I'll report you.

95
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:57,112
Alright. Alright.

96
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,392
I'm very sorry. A bit
crazy this morning.

97
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:20,912
To the point, then.

98
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:24,684
Mrs. Nichols, we've
decided to recommend

99
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,072
Jesse to special education.

100
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:27,851
What?

101
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:31,352
Harrison has a very
effective program.

102
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,049
We feel they're
better equipped...

103
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:34,167
to deal with your son...

104
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:34,747
than we are.

105
00:15:34,752 --> 00:15:36,242
What are you
talking about...

106
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:37,785
'better equipped'?
He's a child!

107
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,226
His maturity level is
equal to a five year old's.

108
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:44,271
As is yours Mrs. Bachanas.
I'm still dealing with you.

109
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:47,724
No, I've seen those classes.
He does not belong in a...

110
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:50,031
special ed class.
He's not special ed!

111
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,503
You know what that'll do to...

112
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:52,906
him? Putting him
in that class?

113
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,565
We simply don't have the...

114
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,591
resources to make
this work here.

115
00:15:56,711 --> 00:15:58,885
I know it's not a
perfect fit, but...

116
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,826
it's all the
district has left.

117
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:05,871
He'll be able to understand
instructions. He can succeed!

118
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:07,603
You know what he
needs? He needs...

119
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:08,943
a teacher who's willing to...

120
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:11,186
see him as an individual
with individual needs.

121
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:14,273
Individual ways of processing
information. You know!

122
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:15,106
You know that!

123
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:16,800
He understands!
He just gets...

124
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:18,821
distracted, he gets
a little bored...

125
00:16:18,826 --> 00:16:21,186
He's not interested in
regurgitated facts.

126
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:22,794
Just let him think
for himself, please!

127
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,085
He doesn't listen!
He distracts...

128
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,186
himself and the entire class!

129
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:30,671
He does listen. He hears
every word you say.

130
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,455
Nonetheless Mrs. Nichols,
this is the decision.

131
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,031
Friday will be
his last day here.

132
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:43,511
I can't afford private school.

133
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:47,791
Then starting Monday, Jesse
will have to attend...

134
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:49,796
the classes at Harrison.

135
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:52,198
I am sorry, but you...

136
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:54,911
no longer have a
choice in the matter.

137
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:58,711
No, he's my son! We'll
always have a choice...

138
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:02,351
Mrs. Nichols...
No, don't please.

139
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:08,671
Come on.

140
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:12,431
Oh, Jesse, come on!

141
00:17:12,436 --> 00:17:15,242
But I did a triple
knot this time.

142
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:19,231
All right, just take
your foot out. Come on!

143
00:17:19,351 --> 00:17:20,307
I'm trying!

144
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:23,111
I know you are. All
right. Let's go...

145
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:26,166
What about my shoe?

146
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,511
We'll get another
pair of shoes.

147
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:39,591
Jesse!

148
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:42,229
Jesse!

149
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:43,669
Oh yeah, sorry.

150
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:47,471
No, honey your feet, take
them off the coffee table.

151
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:51,071
Sorry.

152
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:57,946
All right, sweetie.

153
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,791
Let me get in there.
Are we done?

154
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:07,511
Yeah, we're done.

155
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:14,836
Have you tried
the card club?

156
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:17,231
I'm not going back there.

157
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:19,728
How do you spell 'mirror'?

158
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,991
You ever worked
there? 2 'r'-s honey!

159
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:26,231
- You haven't told him yet?
- No.

160
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:28,282
How do you spell 'faces'?

161
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:30,791
With a 'c', you
know that one Jess!

162
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:35,205
What? What should I do? You
know? You have an easy answer?

163
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,106
There's no easy answer!

164
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:40,914
He wouldn't understand! What
am I gonna do when he...

165
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,071
asks me 'what did I do wrong'?

166
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:45,511
'Why can't I hang
out with my friends?

167
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:48,631
Why am I reading the same
book I read 3 years ago?'

168
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,715
I can't put
him in that class

169
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,831
Well, you can't
just not tell him.

170
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:56,871
I know, I know. I'm gonna
figure something out.

171
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:02,551
- Mom, it's not working!
- I'm coming!

172
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,510
- Mom!
- Yes, honey?

173
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,430
- This isn't working very well
- No?

174
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:17,470
- The pencil keeps punching...
- All right, let me see.

175
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,750
It's 'cause it's a soft chair.

176
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,830
I don't like soft chairs.

177
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,910
Look, we'll put a
hard book under it...

178
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,670
What do you think?

179
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,045
'You can do it.' Plus, plus,

180
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,654
plus. Heart.
Exclamation point.

181
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:41,659
Smiley face.

182
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,590
- Hey dad!
- Bud.

183
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,579
So I figured you'd just
give me a lesson plan,

184
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:22,345
and I'll follow it.

185
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,197
You'll make me a list of stuff

186
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:26,202
I gotta buy to
get him started.

187
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,405
And you know, just do it!

188
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,310
I don't know! I
don't know if you're...

189
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,190
What?

190
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,656
You don't think
I'm smart enough?

191
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:38,905
Here we go, that's not
it, and you know it.

192
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,922
Well no it isn't, you've
just said that I'm not...

193
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,025
cut out for it...

194
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,610
How is it more
complicated? We...

195
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:46,330
can't put him in a
special ed program.

196
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:48,705
Of course not, can we just
talk about this tonight?

197
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,139
Please, I've just got 34 7th...

198
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:51,621
graders who need
their tests...

199
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,265
by 5th period.

200
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,617
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't want to
interrupt your students'...

201
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,622
education. You know...

202
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:22,830
- I've called in.
- What about your 7th graders?

203
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,763
You really wanna do this?

204
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:34,310
No, I don't think
we have a choice.

205
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,510
I'll go partime again.
I guess, I'll do nights.

206
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,310
I can get my shift back
at the resource center.

207
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,910
Why can't they just teach him?

208
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,190
'Cause they're idiots.
All teachers are idiots.

209
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,590
Well, we all are.

210
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,949
Thank you.

211
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,704
Hi.

212
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:13,509
Hi, Saul.

213
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:21,189
Just a minute.

214
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:39,629
Is she coming?

215
00:23:40,189 --> 00:23:43,869
I would imagine so.

216
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:49,029
They won't let me
see her will they?

217
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:52,709
There are reasons
for that, Saul.

218
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:55,469
Yeah.

219
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:05,949
Do you think she hates you?

220
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:10,069
And would you,
if you were her?

221
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:16,189
Maybe.

222
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:19,349
Probably, yes.

223
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:22,749
But, I'm not her.

224
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:26,109
I didn't know you then.

225
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:30,429
Neither did she.

226
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:36,469
She just looked at me.

227
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:43,829
That's it. She
just looked at me.

228
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,869
Do you want her to hate you?

229
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:02,509
I pray to God she hates me.

230
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:09,348
What?

231
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:12,388
You're almost out.

232
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:15,908
Here, take those.
You take 'em!

233
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,188
- Pop?
- What?

234
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:22,308
- I need to talk to you.
- You need to work.

235
00:26:22,428 --> 00:26:25,771
There's no work, pop. There's
no appartment, nothing.

236
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:26,583
We're done.

237
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:31,028
What are you talking about?
We've got everything we need.

238
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:19,188
You've gotta be kidding me.

239
00:28:22,988 --> 00:28:24,988
Come on.

240
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:28,985
There's more to your entire
life than this one act...

241
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,223
from your past.

242
00:28:30,228 --> 00:28:33,708
There's more to you
than this right here.

243
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:35,424
Well, if there's
something more,

244
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:36,876
you know, it's kinda we're...

245
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,863
running out of time.

246
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:42,456
God's plan is something
you'll find in yourself.

247
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:44,461
God's plan?

248
00:28:47,988 --> 00:28:54,028
Yes. Yes, God's plan. He's
got a plan for you, Saul.

249
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:55,858
For you and for me?

250
00:28:55,863 --> 00:29:00,508
For you, for me, for every
living creature on this Earth.

251
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:05,868
How does that work,
exactly, Steven?

252
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:10,468
How does God choose,
who gets what plan?

253
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:16,668
So you've got the plan
with a mother -...

254
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,426
wakes up every morning,
makes you breakfast.

255
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:21,651
Sees you off to a
nice day at school.

256
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:25,065
The one where your father
comes home from...

257
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,902
his modest 9 to 5 job.

258
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:30,801
Takes the time out of his
day to throw the ball around,

259
00:29:30,806 --> 00:29:32,806
help you with your homework.

260
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:37,147
Read you a story before bed.

261
00:29:40,627 --> 00:29:46,107
What happens if I get that
white picket fence plan?

262
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:50,439
And you sit here. Across
your one and only visitor...

263
00:29:50,444 --> 00:29:52,747
who happens to be a minister.

264
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:55,695
Determined to convince
you that even...

265
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,947
the worst of
God's creatures...

266
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:00,639
can find a meaning in life?

267
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:03,787
Would you feel
the same way then?

268
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:11,103
You do not have the right to
tell me about God's plan.

269
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:12,782
There is no plan.

270
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:15,987
I was born alone, and
today I'm gonna die alone.

271
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:19,987
And everything
between was my choice.

272
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:24,787
Do not tell me
about God's plan!

273
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:37,667
Let's see, laundry,
dusting, mopping...

274
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:40,016
That's...I mean
that's what I...

275
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:42,040
that's what I did
since I had...

276
00:30:42,045 --> 00:30:43,228
my son, you know.

277
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:45,233
That's what I 've been doing.

278
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:27,187
- Give me those!
- Why! ?

279
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:29,512
Put 'em down,
just put 'em down.

280
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:31,462
Please, can I have it, Mom?

281
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:34,227
Mom!

282
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:46,518
Okay now, listen. When
I say stay on the chair,

283
00:31:46,523 --> 00:31:48,302
I don't mean climb on it -

284
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,181
I don't mean climb
on the railings...

285
00:31:50,186 --> 00:31:51,807
and touch the
chair once in a...

286
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:53,482
while, I mean stay
on the chair!

287
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:56,047
I've been there for 5
minutes. You're not a baby!

288
00:31:56,052 --> 00:31:58,462
I was always touching the
chair! I never let go!

289
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:00,389
No, you know what
I meant. You...

290
00:32:00,394 --> 00:32:02,258
know exactly what
I meant, Jess.

291
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:04,263
Okay, just listen.
Listen to me!

292
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:05,265
But Mom...

293
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:09,187
No Jess! I need your help,
I can't do this, okay?

294
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:13,507
I need you to help
me. Can you do that?

295
00:32:40,147 --> 00:32:43,672
Do you want the
rest of my root beer?

296
00:32:43,677 --> 00:32:46,026
No I'm good buddy, thanks.

297
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,946
You don't like
root beer, do you?

298
00:32:55,066 --> 00:32:58,506
I like good Pizza.

299
00:33:06,626 --> 00:33:08,486
'If then God so
clothe the grass,

300
00:33:08,491 --> 00:33:10,181
which is to day in the field,'

301
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:13,706
'and to morrow is
cast into the oven;'

302
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:17,734
'how much more will
he clothe you,

303
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:20,266
O ye of little faith?'

304
00:33:21,506 --> 00:33:24,466
And the rest?

305
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:27,861
The rest?

306
00:33:27,866 --> 00:33:32,426
'Sufficient unto the day
is the evil thereof.'

307
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,106
If God is in control...

308
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:42,826
Why didn't he stop me?

309
00:33:42,946 --> 00:33:46,666
We can't know all
the reasons, Saul.

310
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:52,426
Only he sees the big picture.
His omniscence is his alone.

311
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:55,035
All right, come on
man. Come on man!

312
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,021
You can't hide behind that!

313
00:33:57,026 --> 00:33:57,947
It's bullshit!

314
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,786
Forget about me! What
about the little boy?

315
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:05,306
Was that in God's plan?
Did he deserve it?

316
00:34:05,426 --> 00:34:10,154
I don't know. No one
could ever know that.

317
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,601
Why?

318
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:13,701
- Why don't you tell me, Saul?
- 'Cause you couldn't.

319
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:18,146
- Well, that's bullshit!
- Really?

320
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,226
2 grand?

321
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,746
Yeah.

322
00:34:40,226 --> 00:34:43,106
Straight up? All at once?

323
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:45,706
Pretty much.

324
00:34:49,586 --> 00:34:51,607
I don't know, Saul. I'm not...

325
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:54,106
really into giving
second tier loans.

326
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:55,866
And at the end of
the day, I'm...

327
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:57,461
betting on your
card skills -...

328
00:34:57,466 --> 00:35:02,866
which seem to be at present,
not too performance-oriented.

329
00:35:12,306 --> 00:35:18,706
Tell you what.
Why don't you work for it?

330
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,449
Minimize my risk,
avoid double debt.

331
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:22,661
It's a win-win.

332
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:26,351
I appreciate that.
But it's not...

333
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:28,356
gonna work for me.

334
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:34,226
What's not gonna work for you?
What's your problem, Saul?

335
00:35:35,026 --> 00:35:38,086
Why don't you take some
responsibility for yourself?

336
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:39,261
Some accountability?

337
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:41,484
If I may be frank, your work...

338
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:43,706
ethic is a little
back assward.

339
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:48,306
I don't think you understand.
I don't have the time.

340
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:51,273
Ok, look man, do me a favor:
don't think, it's not...

341
00:35:51,278 --> 00:35:52,781
your strong suit. All right?

342
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:57,226
I'm not sitting here offering
you a full-time position.

343
00:36:00,986 --> 00:36:05,787
Tell you what man, come back
next week, maybe we can...

344
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:08,065
There's no next week! Okay?

345
00:36:10,265 --> 00:36:13,905
There is no tomorrow.

346
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:18,025
I need 2000 dollars tonight.

347
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:21,345
That's it.

348
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:29,305
All right.

349
00:36:32,345 --> 00:36:36,041
One job, one
hour, one payment.

350
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:39,145
When you're done of course.

351
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:43,545
I think I know what
it is you need Saul.

352
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:47,105
And I'm telling you this
job will match your...

353
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,110
needs with my resources.

354
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:54,865
Synergy, Saul.

355
00:36:56,745 --> 00:36:58,985
Yeah.

356
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:18,785
Go around!

357
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:25,785
What?

358
00:38:57,505 --> 00:39:01,385
- You're serious?
- Absolutely.

359
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:05,105
I want him to rot in hell.

360
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:08,537
You make this
trek every year?

361
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:09,380
Yeah...

362
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:14,105
- Why?
- Because it's what I do

363
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:16,380
It's my responsibility.

364
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:19,665
It's the most
important thing I do.

365
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:23,105
It's sort of like
your calling?

366
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:28,625
I didn't mean it. I just...

367
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:33,662
People think justice comes
back in the courtroom,

368
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,499
when the sentence is said.

369
00:39:35,504 --> 00:39:37,534
But it doesn't.

370
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:42,144
It's meted out
slowly, continually.

371
00:39:42,264 --> 00:39:45,384
Year after year.

372
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:48,670
Are you gonna watch?

373
00:39:48,675 --> 00:39:51,104
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

374
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:16,457
So what weight is your
trailer rated for?

375
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:19,344
Because I still
think it's too heavy.

376
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:21,525
What? I don't look a mechanic.

377
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:25,104
I don't know. It's a blowout.
Can you fix a blowout?

378
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:28,064
Does the phone work?

379
00:40:30,184 --> 00:40:33,304
Can I call, please.

380
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,139
Mom! Mom!

381
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:26,904
Look at these boots! They're
so cool, aren't they?

382
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:28,451
Are they comfortable?

383
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:30,504
Yeah! They're
really comfortable!

384
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:34,390
'Cause you know they gotta
be for every day, you gotta...

385
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:37,104
be able to wear them
for every day, right?

386
00:41:37,224 --> 00:41:39,539
But they look
really big, honey.

387
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:40,979
I'll grow into them.

388
00:41:40,984 --> 00:41:42,643
Let me try 'em on.

389
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:45,304
I don't think
they'll fit you...

390
00:41:45,384 --> 00:41:48,127
You don't? Do
you want to bet?

391
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:50,704
I'll bet when you try them on.

392
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,584
That's not a bet,
that's a sure thing.

393
00:41:56,384 --> 00:42:00,944
Wow, you look good in them!
You should buy them too!

394
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:03,982
Aren't they
really comfortable?

395
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:05,339
No, they're...

396
00:42:05,344 --> 00:42:06,782
They're like hell.

397
00:42:06,787 --> 00:42:10,784
Can we just try, these cool
kind of shoes, please?

398
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:12,673
Why? Those aren't cool.

399
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:16,064
These are really cool!
They're cowboy boots.

400
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:19,944
Look, I'll get the right size.

401
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:23,135
Jess!

402
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,824
Told you, you can
wear it in the rain!

403
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:29,654
Don't you at least want
to take the tags off?

404
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:32,544
No way! I'm saving
them for school!

405
00:42:33,744 --> 00:42:36,784
Come on you vile monkey.

406
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:40,784
Ow, that hurts!

407
00:42:40,904 --> 00:42:44,904
- Why are you dancing, huh?
- Bread and butter

408
00:45:31,143 --> 00:45:34,383
Get out of my car!

409
00:45:34,823 --> 00:45:37,503
Get out of my car!

410
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:11,443
I sent the payment
yesterday. It's my car!

411
00:46:11,448 --> 00:46:13,943
You tell him to
leave me alone!

412
00:47:07,422 --> 00:47:10,662
Gimme that quarter over there.

413
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:13,742
Just give me one of 'em.

414
00:47:13,942 --> 00:47:16,702
Here, hook 'em up.

415
00:47:38,102 --> 00:47:39,251
That's your customer,

416
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,337
why didn't you do
what I tell ya, huh?

417
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:44,302
Hurry up, you...

418
00:47:44,502 --> 00:47:48,022
Don't you roll
your eyes at me!

419
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:02,701
Thank you.

420
00:50:35,141 --> 00:50:37,901
Here you go.

421
00:50:38,341 --> 00:50:42,141
- Want anything?
- No, no thanks.

422
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:47,181
- Missed us, huh?
- Oh yeah, horribly.

423
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:49,999
Got a 6 to 2 shift,
you'll be perfect for it.

424
00:50:50,004 --> 00:50:52,764
It's a tougher crowd, I
need tougher people...

425
00:50:52,861 --> 00:50:56,221
- Monday through Friday?
- Wednesday through Sunday.

426
00:50:56,341 --> 00:51:00,061
Did you hear, what
you paid me today?

427
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:05,461
- No. You wanna tell me?
- 200, buddy. 200!

428
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:11,712
Now this is what we need
more of around here, Sam.

429
00:51:12,581 --> 00:51:16,661
Don't let this one get away.

430
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,429
My niece thinks she's
ready for the tables now...

431
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:22,941
for the likes of you.

432
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:27,781
- Tommy, get over here!
- Yeah, I'm coming.

433
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:33,108
It is what it is, sweetheart.

434
00:51:33,113 --> 00:51:34,845
You out of anybody
should know that.

435
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,702
Yeah, it's been a while.

436
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:40,333
That's right, which means...

437
00:51:40,338 --> 00:51:42,896
Darla's gonna have to train
you all over again.

438
00:51:42,901 --> 00:51:44,901
Which means, if we do this,

439
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:48,011
I'm gonna need a 6
month commitment.

440
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:50,661
Minimum.

441
00:51:51,101 --> 00:51:53,981
Saul.

442
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:57,021
Saul?

443
00:51:58,661 --> 00:52:02,261
Yeah?
I know.

444
00:52:11,701 --> 00:52:16,061
If you're the sole controller
of your own destiny...

445
00:52:17,141 --> 00:52:21,975
you really believe that God
is unavailable in that world?

446
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:22,856
Yes I do.

447
00:52:22,861 --> 00:52:26,177
Why are you so
determined to resist...

448
00:52:26,182 --> 00:52:28,182
goodness in your life?

449
00:52:32,341 --> 00:52:33,902
You can't have it both ways.

450
00:52:33,907 --> 00:52:36,696
You can't be the victim
and claim to have peace...

451
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:42,612
I'm not the victim. I've
never claimed to be...

452
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,617
a victim.

453
00:52:45,781 --> 00:52:51,301
Then you're not a victim.
But you want peace.

454
00:52:51,781 --> 00:52:53,819
You claim to be
powerless to achieve it,

455
00:52:53,824 --> 00:52:56,576
and yet you want to be the
sole owner of your actions.

456
00:52:56,581 --> 00:52:58,508
Oh for God's sake!

457
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:02,261
So you want to
claim all the power?

458
00:53:02,381 --> 00:53:05,421
You truly want peace?

459
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:09,145
Then allow yourself to
believe for a moment,

460
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:12,181
that someone in this
world loves you.

461
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,260
- Who? God?
- Yes.

462
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,420
Yes, God.

463
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,900
God loves you.

464
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:30,020
And for that alone,
your life has value.

465
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,054
If you want peace, why
are you so adamant...

466
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:42,059
that it's not possible?

467
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,176
If God doesn't want
to bother with you,

468
00:53:47,181 --> 00:53:49,780
why is your heart so heavy?

469
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,980
Where do you think
this guilt comes from?

470
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:06,020
- It's a lot warmer in here!
- Are you driving?

471
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,448
I still gotta go to
the grocery store...

472
00:54:11,453 --> 00:54:12,735
before dinner.

473
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:17,118
We'll drop you off
and then Jessie and I...

474
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:19,015
will come back.

475
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,800
I want to go with
Dad! My Moto-Father

476
00:54:22,805 --> 00:54:26,100
I'll take him with
me if you want.

477
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,669
No sweetie-pie, he's
got a lot of work...

478
00:54:29,674 --> 00:54:31,255
to do before dinner.

479
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,620
Come with your Moto-Mama

480
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,620
In the back.

481
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,780
- Thank you.
- I'll see you in a bit.

482
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,380
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

483
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,860
See you!

484
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,540
Bye!

485
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,460
Mom? Mom!

486
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,460
We have to go, honey!

487
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:22,179
Come on, sweetie.

488
00:57:23,299 --> 00:57:25,419
Hi.

489
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:27,094
Hi!

490
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:31,699
Can I stay here?

491
00:57:33,019 --> 00:57:35,857
Sweetie, I can't see
you from in the store.

492
00:57:35,862 --> 00:57:37,494
You gotta come with me.

493
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:39,271
Please, I just wanna read.

494
00:57:39,276 --> 00:57:41,619
No, get your coat.
Come on, let's go.

495
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,437
It's so boring in
the store, I hate it.

496
00:57:43,442 --> 00:57:44,134
Don't be hatin'!

497
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:46,255
Can I bring the comic?

498
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,699
No, leave the book.
Put your jacket on.

499
00:57:49,819 --> 00:57:52,846
It's not so bad, 10
minutes in the grocery store.

500
00:57:52,851 --> 00:57:56,294
I know, but that's 10 minutes
in here, why can't I just...

501
00:57:56,299 --> 00:57:59,071
That's the point!
I can just stay...

502
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:01,539
It's just 10
minutes in the car.

503
00:58:03,339 --> 00:58:05,396
Boots go on your feet.

504
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:08,659
I'm saving these for
school, remember?

505
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:22,939
- So, what are we getting?
- Cereal

506
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,739
What are you going for?

507
00:58:28,659 --> 00:58:31,297
Really? I was kind
of hoping for...

508
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:33,939
something with a
little more sugar.

509
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:36,619
Sugar is bad for you.

510
00:58:59,259 --> 00:59:01,459
How are we doin' there, buddy?

511
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,459
Well, we have 4 folders.

512
00:59:04,579 --> 00:59:07,979
You've got spirals
in the binder?

513
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:12,285
So you're in the
middle of the ocean.

514
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,379
It's clear for like 200 feet.

515
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:17,214
And even before you hear...

516
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:20,739
the song of the
whale, you feel it.

517
00:59:20,859 --> 00:59:25,259
Yeah, like this vibration.
It's right here.

518
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:30,539
You watch 'em, okay?
Don't let anything happen

519
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:35,019
I'll be right here.

520
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:45,017
So, it should be
a while before...

521
00:59:45,022 --> 00:59:47,579
you really find... Right.

522
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:50,022
Can you hold it for
a second please?

523
00:59:50,027 --> 00:59:50,694
Can I help you?

524
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:53,382
Yeah, I need a prescription
for my father.

525
00:59:53,387 --> 00:59:54,614
Gregors, last name.

526
00:59:54,619 --> 00:59:57,499
- First name?
- Benjamin.

527
00:59:57,619 --> 01:00:02,658
Hi, do you have any employment
application forms?

528
01:00:03,658 --> 01:00:06,479
Make sure he takes
these with a meal.

529
01:00:06,484 --> 01:00:08,618
These are your instructions.

530
01:00:15,138 --> 01:00:18,538
20 dollars, please.

531
01:00:48,818 --> 01:00:52,098
Do you have another pen?
This one isn't working.

532
01:00:54,338 --> 01:00:57,378
Can I help you?

533
01:00:59,938 --> 01:01:02,778
Yeah, I uh...

534
01:01:08,778 --> 01:01:12,538
I need 2000 dollars now!

535
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:18,258
What are you doing! ?

536
01:01:18,378 --> 01:01:21,178
You hear me?

537
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:30,938
Just stay there!

538
01:02:32,258 --> 01:02:35,378
Don't move!

539
01:02:36,338 --> 01:02:39,458
Just stay there, okay?
Just stay!

540
01:02:40,218 --> 01:02:42,898
Just give me the money!

541
01:02:45,658 --> 01:02:48,338
Go, go, go! Come on!

542
01:02:54,418 --> 01:02:56,738
Put the phone down!

543
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:58,413
Now!

544
01:02:58,418 --> 01:03:00,898
Come on, hurry!

545
01:03:08,778 --> 01:03:12,658
You! Stay there! Don't!

546
01:03:14,018 --> 01:03:16,258
No! Just stay there.

547
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:19,618
Jess! No!

548
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:23,698
No!

549
01:03:23,818 --> 01:03:26,778
Please, let him go!

550
01:03:26,898 --> 01:03:30,577
- Honey, it's okay
- Mom!

551
01:03:52,017 --> 01:03:52,877
Mom!

552
01:03:52,882 --> 01:03:57,337
Honey, it's okay.
It's alright!

553
01:03:58,057 --> 01:04:01,370
I'm leaving now, okay?
Nobody call the cops!

554
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:03,375
He's gonna be fine. Stay!

555
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:08,257
- Please stay!
- You give him back to me!

556
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:10,417
No! No!

557
01:04:10,537 --> 01:04:13,257
10 minutes...

558
01:04:13,377 --> 01:04:18,417
- You take me!
- Give me 10 minutes!

559
01:04:23,217 --> 01:04:26,057
Jesse!

560
01:04:50,097 --> 01:04:53,577
Look, your mommy's
coming, okay?

561
01:04:53,697 --> 01:04:56,817
Be quiet

562
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:07,257
Mom, mommy! No!

563
01:05:33,617 --> 01:05:37,857
Help! Get me out of here!

564
01:05:48,857 --> 01:05:54,777
No, don't call!
Please, he said not to call!

565
01:05:56,097 --> 01:05:59,217
Can you wait? Please,
can you just wait?

566
01:05:59,337 --> 01:06:02,337
Just 10 minutes.

567
01:06:02,817 --> 01:06:07,537
- Let me out!
- We're almost there, okay?

568
01:06:16,297 --> 01:06:18,066
M'am? We need to call!

569
01:06:18,071 --> 01:06:21,537
He said not to call! I
don't know what to do...

570
01:06:23,977 --> 01:06:26,532
We need to call the police

571
01:06:26,537 --> 01:06:29,457
He's my son! He's
my little boy!

572
01:06:31,257 --> 01:06:34,857
Please don't call the police!

573
01:06:36,857 --> 01:06:41,017
I don't know what to do

574
01:06:49,217 --> 01:06:51,737
You'll be okay.

575
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:58,116
Get out of the way!

576
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:02,616
Hang on!

577
01:07:03,256 --> 01:07:06,138
I'll let you out
in just a minute!

578
01:07:06,143 --> 01:07:08,856
All right? We'll
be right there!

579
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:16,816
You okay? You alright?

580
01:09:24,096 --> 01:09:25,624
'Yea, though I walk through...

581
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:27,411
the valley of the
shadow of death,'

582
01:09:27,416 --> 01:09:31,576
'I shall fear no evil:
for thou art with me;'

583
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:34,125
'thy rod and thy
staff they comfort me.

584
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:36,496
Thou preparest a
table before me in...

585
01:09:36,616 --> 01:09:39,056
6421 returning.

586
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:41,978
'thou anointest my
head with oil;...

587
01:09:41,983 --> 01:09:43,731
my cup runneth over.'

588
01:09:43,736 --> 01:09:45,671
'Surely goodness
and mercy shall...

589
01:09:45,676 --> 01:09:47,611
follow me all the
days of my life:'

590
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:50,896
'and I shall dwell in the
house of the Lord for ever.'

591
01:09:51,016 --> 01:09:52,312
All clear?

592
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:55,776
Hang on! Hang on!
Just a minute!

593
01:10:05,816 --> 01:10:07,451
Okay.

594
01:10:07,456 --> 01:10:10,616
I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do.

595
01:10:18,695 --> 01:10:21,535
Come with now!

596
01:12:39,295 --> 01:12:42,055
Okay, go ahead.

597
01:12:42,455 --> 01:12:45,520
Can I see the sign-in
sheet, please?

598
01:12:45,525 --> 01:12:47,525
Thank you.

599
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:50,815
M'am you need to
sign it right here.

600
01:12:52,775 --> 01:12:56,335
- Can I use the phone?
- Sure, go ahead.

601
01:15:06,894 --> 01:15:10,614
Jesse! No! Let me see him!
Let me see him, please!

602
01:15:12,934 --> 01:15:17,774
Jesse, I'm here, honey!

603
01:15:43,894 --> 01:15:49,094
He is my everything!
Please do something...

604
01:15:50,334 --> 01:15:53,334
Please do something!

605
01:15:56,694 --> 01:15:59,254
No!

606
01:16:05,214 --> 01:16:07,414
You need something?

607
01:16:07,534 --> 01:16:10,614
Yeah. I wanna see him.

608
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:11,528
Excuse me?

609
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,533
I wanna talk to the prisoner.

610
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:17,014
I'm sorry Mrs. Nichols,
I don't think that's possible.

611
01:16:17,134 --> 01:16:20,654
No, it's entirely possible.
Call your supervisor.

612
01:16:20,774 --> 01:16:24,147
I don't think he's gonna
give you a different answer.

613
01:16:24,152 --> 01:16:26,174
Mr. Runyan, call
your supervisor.

614
01:16:34,254 --> 01:16:35,489
Are you in charge?

615
01:16:35,494 --> 01:16:38,214
I understand you'd like
to see the prisoner?

616
01:16:38,254 --> 01:16:40,334
No, I wanna speak to him.

617
01:16:40,339 --> 01:16:42,574
Well, that's not a good idea.

618
01:16:42,694 --> 01:16:47,254
I just wanna...
I need to talk to him.

619
01:16:48,174 --> 01:16:51,604
Look, I understand
what he did to you,

620
01:16:51,609 --> 01:16:53,774
what he did to your son.

621
01:16:54,534 --> 01:16:57,649
And it must be very difficult,
but I can't... I'm afraid...

622
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:01,694
You have no idea.

623
01:17:01,814 --> 01:17:04,944
I pray every night
that he suffers...

624
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:06,949
the same pain I endure.

625
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:09,973
Every morning when I wake up,

626
01:17:09,978 --> 01:17:13,893
I don't see my son, I
don't see my husband.

627
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:20,573
I wanna see him.

628
01:17:22,253 --> 01:17:26,493
Is it illegal for
me to speak to him?

629
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:34,413
No, it's not illegal.

630
01:18:14,133 --> 01:18:17,813
Stand right here.
I need to search your purse.

631
01:18:17,933 --> 01:18:21,813
Feet shoulder-width apart,
hands against the wall.

632
01:18:33,053 --> 01:18:37,173
- Ready, Ma'am?
- Yes.

633
01:19:19,533 --> 01:19:22,693
I'm sorry

634
01:19:32,013 --> 01:19:35,453
I'm so sorry.

635
01:20:04,573 --> 01:20:08,325
I've tried to
imagine what you...

636
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:10,330
who you are.

637
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:15,533
What your day was like before.

638
01:20:18,253 --> 01:20:22,333
I've put together
your entire life...

639
01:20:22,533 --> 01:20:25,413
from a single moment.

640
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:29,693
I feel like I know you.

641
01:20:32,892 --> 01:20:36,212
I don't know who you are,

642
01:20:36,572 --> 01:20:39,972
or what I've taken from you.

643
01:20:40,932 --> 01:20:44,732
Even then, I'm so sorry.

644
01:21:13,572 --> 01:21:18,172
I've tried for so long
not to give you a face.

645
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:22,852
It's so much better when
you don't have a face.

646
01:21:24,612 --> 01:21:29,012
All these details
of you in my mind,

647
01:21:29,892 --> 01:21:32,452
in my imagination.

648
01:21:34,092 --> 01:21:36,883
And I think I have
pieced together...

649
01:21:36,888 --> 01:21:39,452
your whole life on
the drive here.

650
01:21:43,212 --> 01:21:47,172
I'm sure it's all wrong.

651
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:53,252
I'm sure it doesn't matter.

652
01:22:34,892 --> 01:22:37,972
I forgive you.

653
01:22:41,852 --> 01:22:45,412
I have to forgive you.

654
01:22:55,212 --> 01:22:57,972
Sorry.

655
01:29:02,331 --> 01:29:10,331
