1
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,640
I forgot where I am.

2
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
You're at the place
where the killers meet

3
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,400
to decide what to do
with the crippled girl.

4
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,840
Oh, that's right. That's right.

5
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,840
Did you hear that?

6
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,840
That's funny.

7
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,080
That's weird. Those people look
like they're clawing at themselves.

8
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,520
Is that blood?

9
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,600
Claire, are you seeing this?

10
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,960
Claire.

11
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
Claire?

12
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,440
Claire?

13
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
What page was I on?

14
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,280
Page.

15
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,760
I need an extension over here.
- Fall back. Fall back.

16
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,920
You kidding me?
Like another 20 feet.

17
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,480
Don't touch that.
That's for the drywall guys.

18
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,720
I told you he wouldn't do it!

19
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,240
So then the little guy says,

20
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,640
"You have a girlfriend named Wendy, too?
Well, I saw your thing and it said 'WY'."

21
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,800
The big guy says, "No, man, mine says,
'Welcome to Jamaica, have a nice day."'

22
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,680
Christ, McKenzie fell.

23
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,200
Medic, we have a major accident
at the south side of the building.

24
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,240
We'll need an ambulance.
<i>- Copy.</i>

25
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,840
Jesus.

26
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,400
Give him some room.

27
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,840
Hey!
- Somebody fell!

28
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,000
Davis?
- Oh, my God, he just fell!

29
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,440
Someone fell! Over that building!

30
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,240
Oh, my God!

31
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,360
Watch it.
- Oh, my God!

32
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Watch it. Get out of there!

33
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Help!
- Look out!

34
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,080
Look out!

35
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,560
God in heaven.

36
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,120
Look, I don't know if you guys
have heard about this article

37
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,040
in <i>The New York Times</i>
about honeybees vanishing?

38
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,320
Well, apparently, honeybees are
disappearing all over the country.

39
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,600
Tens of millions of them.
Just disappearing.

40
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,080
There's no bodies, no sign of them.
They're just mysteriously gone.

41
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,160
It's scary, huh?

42
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,480
All right, let's hear some theories
about why this might be happening.

43
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,600
Nothing? Come on, guys.

44
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,240
Laura.
- Disease?

45
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,120
Right. Could be a virus or infection.

46
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,960
But it's all over the country.
It's a coordinated event in 24 states.

47
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,400
It's a little tricky.

48
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,880
Pollution?
- Could be.

49
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,280
I mean, we're just pumping
so much junk into the environment

50
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,960
they're just keeling over.

51
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,040
But there are no bodies. Keep guessing.

52
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,600
Dylan.

53
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,840
Global warming.

54
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,560
Temperature goes up a fraction of a
degree, makes them disoriented?

55
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,840
Maybe.

56
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,560
Jake?

57
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,000
You don't have an opinion?

58
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,080
You're not interested
in what happened to the bees?

59
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,600
You should be more interested
in science, Jake.

60
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,160
You know why?
Because your face is perfect.

61
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,840
The problem is,
your face is perfect at 15.

62
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,000
Now, if you were interested in science,
you would know facts

63
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,040
like the human nose and ears
grow a fraction of an inch each year.

64
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,560
So a perfect balance of features now

65
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,080
might not look so perfect
five years from now.

66
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,520
They might look downright whack
10 years from now.

67
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,240
Come on, buddy.
Take an interest in science.

68
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,320
What could be a reason
the bees have vanished?

69
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,120
An act of nature and
we'll never fully understand it.

70
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,320
Nice answer, Jake.

71
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,840
He's right.

72
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,840
I mean, science will come up
with some reason to put in the books,

73
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,160
but in the end, it'll be just a theory.

74
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,240
We will fail to acknowledge that there are
forces at work beyond our understanding.

75
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,120
To be a good scientist,

76
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,680
you must have a respectful awe
for the laws of nature.

77
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,800
Jake?

78
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,840
How much does the human nose
grow each year?

79
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,400
Oh, man.
- It's minuscule, buddy, okay?

80
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,640
Don't worry about it. You're gonna
be a heartthrob your whole life.

81
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,880
I was just messing with you.

82
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,640
The Dark Lord.
Don't look into her eyes.

83
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,120
Vice Principal!
What can we do for you?

84
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,920
I'm afraid I have to interrupt you
for a moment, Mr. Moore.

85
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,840
Okay, guys, calm down.
I'll be right back.

86
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,240
What is that?
- I can't believe it.

87
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,320
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

88
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,160
I've never seen anything like it before.
- What's going on?

89
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,400
I don't know.

90
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,360
You excused all the teachers?

91
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,040
The administration makes us teach
with a foot of snow on the ground.

92
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,600
What is this?

93
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,760
They stopped class.
- Elliot!

94
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,840
All right.

95
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,360
There appears to be an event happening.

96
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,040
Central Park was just hit by
what seems to be a terrorist attack.

97
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,400
Oh, no.

98
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,400
They're not clear on the scale yet.

99
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,640
It's some kind of
airborne chemical toxin

100
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,760
that's been released
in and around the park.

101
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,480
They said to watch
for warning signs.

102
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,400
The first stage
is confused speech.

103
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,920
The second stage is physical
disorientation, loss of direction.

104
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,680
The third stage is fatal.

105
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,920
Central Park? That's kind of odd.

106
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I spoke with the head of schools.
He said we should dismiss the students.

107
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,800
So take your planners home
so we can get back when this is over.

108
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,440
All right? Let's do our jobs.

109
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,120
Hey, you guys still got to work on
your science projects for next week.

110
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,400
What are the rules of
scientific investigation?

111
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,760
Identify variables.
Design the experiment.

112
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,440
Careful observation and measurement.
Interpretation of experimental data.

113
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,120
Hey, guys?

114
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,720
Nothing.

115
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,280
Alacrity. With alacrity, please.

116
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,960
My mother just called my cell again.
She's hysterical. Hysterical.

117
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,520
I told her the probability of something
happening in Philadelphia is very low.

118
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,040
I mean, nobody's telling us
to leave the city, right?

119
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,440
So I threw some figures at her.
It's good to be a math teacher sometimes.

120
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,680
You know, people are comforted
by percentages. Didn't work.

121
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,920
She still wants us to get out of
the city and come out to her house.

122
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
But she said for
you and Alma to come.

123
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,200
Yeah, let me think
about that, okay?

124
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,800
Did you hear about New York?

125
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,440
Are you okay?

126
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,600
No, I mean, are you okay?

127
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,120
Yeah, me, too.
Listen, I want to talk about it more.

128
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,280
Julian's mom offered for all of us to
get out of the city and stay with her.

129
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,360
What do you think?

130
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,120
Yo, Chris!

131
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,800
I'll bring Jess and Evette
and I'll meet you at the station.

132
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,240
Listen, Julian, if Alma's acting
weird, just be cool, okay?

133
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,400
What's going on?

134
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,280
She's acting odd.
Just don't worry about it, okay?

135
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
Odd?

136
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,480
Look, if she's acting like
she's distant or something...

137
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,160
What?

138
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,200
I can't say any more.

139
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,840
Is she leaving you?

140
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,720
I didn't say that. It's just talk, okay?
Just relax, please?

141
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Hey.

142
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm going to tell you something you
should never tell your best friend.

143
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,680
Why is everybody saying that?

144
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
I saw her on your wedding day.

145
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,160
Again with the wedding. What?

146
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,000
I walked into a waiting room by mistake,
and she was crying.

147
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,760
She looked up. I saw her face.

148
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,920
She wasn't ready to jump in, Elliot.
That's not who she is.

149
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,320
She's never going to jump in
when you need her, man.

150
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,360
<i>So do federal, state and local</i>
<i>officials have a plan in place</i>

151
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
<i>for this type of catastrophe?</i>

152
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,840
<i>Are they utilizing all the</i>

153
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
Hi.
- Are you packed?

154
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,320
Yes.
- What are they saying?

155
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,800
They're evacuating New York City.

156
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,160
<i>Well, our brains come equipped</i>
<i>with a self-preservation mechanism</i>

157
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,280
<i>to stop us from harmful actions.</i>

158
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,400
<i>This is controlled by a combination</i>
<i>of electrochemical signals in the brain.</i>

159
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,960
<i>The blocking of neurotransmitters</i>
<i>by certain toxins</i>

160
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,360
<i>has been proven to cause hallucinations,</i>
<i>asphyxiation and paralysis.</i>

161
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,520
<i>This new neurotoxin is basically</i>
<i>flipping the preservation switch,</i>

162
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,480
<i>blocking neurotransmitters</i>
<i>in a specific order,</i>

163
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,400
<i>causing specific self-damaging</i>
<i>and catastrophic effects.</i>

164
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,760
<i>Just how the toxin works</i>
<i>and who the terrorists are...</i>

165
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
It makes you kill yourself.

166
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,520
Just when you thought there couldn't be
any more evil that could be invented.

167
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,840
I'll be packed in two minutes.

168
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,680

169
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,040

Sir, we need to check your suitcase.

171
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,040

<i>room and this is the latest development.</i>

173
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,240
<i>Autopsies on the first victims confirm</i>
<i>the toxin is a natural compound.</i>

174
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,360
<i>The attacks remain confined</i>
<i>to the New York metropolitan area.</i>

175
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,920
<i>This is a very,
very disturbing story...</i>

176
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,280
<i>Track three now
boarding for Harrisburg.</i>

177
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,440
Hey, Jess. Where's Evette?

178
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,240
She was at a shop across town,
she got stuck in traffic.

179
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,000
She's gonna take the next train.
- We'll wait.

180
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,840
No, no, no. She wanted us
to get on this train with Jess.

181
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,960
She'll feel a lot safer.

182
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,000
Where's Alma?
- Restroom.

183
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,480
Hey, Julian!

184
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,240
Please have your tickets out and ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,680
I bought them.

186
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,680
It was like getting one
of those Cabbage Patch Dolls

187
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,360
when they first came out.

188
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,120
Madhouse. How are you?

189
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,360
Good. You?
- Good.

190
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,960
Okay, good. Why don't we all...
- I'm really glad you chose to come.

191
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,840
Thanks. Elliot, can I
talk to you for a second?

192
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah.

193
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,800
Please show me your tickets,
ladies and gentlemen.

194
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,040
You told him about our fight?
- No.

195
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,240
Why did he say that?
- He guessed.

196
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,720
I love you, Elliot, but I don't like to put
my feelings out there for everyone to see.

197
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm not that type of person.

198
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,240
Elliot, these are our problems.

199
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,200
I am upset.
I'm going to sit alone and cool off.

200
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,560
By the time we get there I'll be fine.
Is that okay?

201
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,800
Fine.

202
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,640
I'm going to get on the train.

203
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,160
We're not gonna
get to sit together anyways.

204
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,440
Okay.

205
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,200
Hey, babe.

206
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Hi, Aunt Alma.
- How you doing?

207
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,680
Hanging in there.
- Me, too.

208
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
What's wrong with you?
- What?

209
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,200
You're wrong about her.
She just needs time to figure it out.

210
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,640
Come on, don't get all sensitive.

211
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,440
Just give her a chance.
- Okay, fine. If you don't want my help...

212
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,640
I don't want your help!
- Okay. I heard it.

213
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,840
Jess, could you ask your dad
for my ticket, please?

214
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,840
Thank you.
I'll see you on the train, Jess.

215
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,760
<i>Track 3 now boarding</i>
<i>all ticketed passengers.</i>

216
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,200
Here we go.

217
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,240
When will Mom meet us at Grandma's?

218
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,160
Mommy's gonna get on the next train.
You know how she's always late.

219
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,120
Come on. Come on. I know. I know.
- Mom.

220
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Chilly, isn't it today, Sal?
- Maybe a little.

221
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,440
Hey, it's me. I'm on a train.
I just want to say something, okay?

222
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,000
You've got to stop calling me.

223
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,040
You're acting like the
<i>Fatal Attraction</i> guy, here.

224
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
I feel like I'm
going to take a shower

225
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,280
and see your silhouette
on the shower curtain.

226
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,440
We ate tiramisu together,
that is it.

227
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,360
I told you that would be it.
You have got to chill out.

228
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,040
What?

229
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,120
When?

230
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
In Philadelphia?

231
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,200
I don't know. What did you hear?
- Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

232
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,680
What's the news?

233
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,600
Apparently Philadelphia
was just attacked.

234
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Oh, my God. Evette.
- Call Mommy. Call Mommy!

235
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,840
Honey!

236
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,120
Honey...
Yeah, yeah, where are you?

237
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,920
What? What?
I can't hear you.

238
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,040
I said I can't hear you!
Text me.

239
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,080
Text me. I can't hear you!

240
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,520
They think it started
in Rittenhouse Square Park.

241
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
Another park?

242
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,200
She got on a bus going to New Jersey.
- I want to talk to her.

243
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,840
I know, baby. I know. She got out.
She's headed to the town of Princeton.

244
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,760
I want to talk to her.

245
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,960
Do you have a phone?
- No, I'm sorry.

246
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
You okay?
- They say Boston got hit, too.

247
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,720
Where'd you hear that?
- A friend from work. What about Evette?

248
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,680
Oh, God. She made it out on a bus.

249
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,280
What the hell is going on, Elliot?

250
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,400
I honestly don't know.

251
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,080
Now what?

252
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,880
It just stopped. I don't know.

253
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,800
Can't go nowhere.
- They're not telling us anything.

254
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,200
Well, until we hear from...
- Sir?

255
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,720
Train service has
been discontinued.

256
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,960
This will be the last stop
for all passengers.

257
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,800
Hey! What do you mean?
Where are we?

258
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,640
Filbert, Pennsylvania.

259
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,840
Filbert?
Does anybody know where that is?

260
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,600
Why are you giving me one useless
piece of information at a time?

261
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,280
What's going on?

262
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,480
Hey, why would you just stop?
You can't just leave us here.

263
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,840
Sir, we lost contact.

264
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,280
With whom?

265
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,120
Everyone.

266
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,960
I'm scared. I don't like it here.
I want Mom.

267
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,760
Don't be silly.
We're safe here, okay?

268
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,760
Sorry. She whispers to us
when she gets scared.

269
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,520
We're so much the same, Jess.
I don't like to show my emotions, either.

270
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,040
She's shivering.

271
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,600
I know. I know.
She's never right without her mom.

272
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,760
It's okay.

273
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,360
They're not saying anything.

274
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
We're stuck here.

275
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,560
Is Jess okay?

276
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,360
She's not talking.

277
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,040
We're in a small town, Jess.
Nothing will happen to us here.

278
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,080
Don't know what you want?

279
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,800
Then just have the grilled cheese
plain with milk, okay?

280
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Come on, come over here.

281
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,120
No, you know what?
Why don't you stay here?

282
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,880
Stay here, all right?
You can see me from over there.

283
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,000
What?
All right, you want to come with me?

284
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760
You can come with me and wait in line.
You want to do that?

285
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,520
Bro! Bro, I got it.
Go get the milk.

286
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,480
All right, yeah. Okay.

287
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,360
You know that everyone
gives off energy, right?

288
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,360
It's scientifically proven.

289
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,480
They got these cameras
that can record what color you are

290
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,360
when you're feeling different things.

291
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,720
People that are angry give off a
different color than people that are sad.

292
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,360
See this ring?

293
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,200
This ring can supposedly tell you
what you're feeling.

294
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,080
Let's see what
you're feeling right now.

295
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,240
Yellow! That's cool.
That means you're about to laugh.

296
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
I'm not making it up.
That's what yellow means.

297
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,400
You must be about
to laugh or something.

298
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
It's probably just
about to come out.

299
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
We'll wait.

300
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,680
We got all day.

301
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,280
Oh, my God. There it is! Cool.
That ring really works. That's amazing.

302
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look at this.

303
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,520
My sister sent it to me.

304
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,840
It was taken an hour ago
at the Philadelphia Zoo.

305
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,080
Mother of God,
what kind of terrorists are these?

306
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,720
They're not sure it's terrorists now.

307
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,560
<i>Moments ago,
in an official statement,</i>

308
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,000
<i>the government moved away</i>
<i>from its initial position</i>

309
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,040
<i>that this was a
terrorist attack.</i>

310
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,440
<i>Authorities are now feeling,</i>

311
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,920
<i>by the sheer number</i>
<i>of incidents being reported,</i>

312
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,840
<i>that a terrorist group being responsible</i>
<i>is becoming less and less likely.</i>

313
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,480
<i>The event appears to be</i>
<i>limited to the Northeast,</i>

314
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,560
<i>where smaller and smaller towns</i>
<i>are being attacked.</i>

315
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Where are we?

316
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,600
<i>The infected area now</i>
<i>includes most of New England,</i>

317
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,400
<i>from Massachusetts to Maryland.</i>

318
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,720
We're dead center.

319
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,880
Everything okay?

320
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,880
If we stay here,
we are gonna die here.

321
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,640
Whatever this is, it looks like it's
not occurring about 90 miles from here.

322
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,800
Let's go.

323
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,080
Anyone got a car?
Can anyone give us a ride?

324
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,920
Hey!

325
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,240
Excuse me, sir?

326
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,600
Sir, could we get a ride, please?

327
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,880
We don't have any transportation.
We're stuck here.

328
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,280
Sir, did you hear what I said?
We don't have any transportation!

329
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
We have a little girl with us. Please.
- Drive. Just roll up the window.

330
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,920
Sir! You're not just going to...

331
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,880
Can you believe
how crappy people are?

332
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,480
There's a car.

333
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,640
Hi. I run a plant
nursery up the street.

334
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,520
We're picking up a few things from home,
then heading

335
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,320
wherever this isn't happening.

336
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,480
We have room.

337
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,240
We have two others.
- That's okay.

338
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,920
Julian!

339
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,360
Is Julian okay?

340
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,600
We got a ride. He can fit all of us.

341
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,440
Elliot, I can't get Evette on
the phone or e-mail or nothing.

342
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,000
How long?
- It's been about two hours.

343
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,880
She was on that
bus headed to Princeton.

344
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,120
There's a car over there headed
to pick up friends and family,

345
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,880
they said they
could squeeze one more.

346
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,200
We got to go.

347
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,080
Look, think real carefully about this.

348
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,920
She was looking
for a birthday present for Jess.

349
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,520
Some kind of dollhouse.
That's why she wasn't with us.

350
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,680
I'm just gonna go get her
and I want to bring her back,

351
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,400
and then I'm gonna find you guys.

352
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,040
I just...
I need you to take Jess, okay?

353
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,520
She's gonna be
a lot safer with you.

354
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,640
Don't do this to me.

355
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm doing my best
here not to fall down.

356
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,560
I'm sure the probability of
Princeton not being hit is good.

357
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,680
Yeah.

358
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,520
You want me to throw some
figures and percentages at you

359
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,680
so we both feel better?

360
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,520
Please.
- All right.

361
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,520
62% chance.
62% chance it hasn't even been hit.

362
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Well, you go get her, Jules, okay?
- Of course, man, of course.

363
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,160
Come on.
This is all some weird event, that's all.

364
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,040
We're all gonna be fine.
I'm gonna find you guys real soon.

365
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,360
I have to go.

366
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,520
I got her, Julian.

367
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,760
Don't take my daughter's hand
unless you mean it.

368
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,160
I'm going to go get Mommy.

369
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,880
Hold our picture.

370
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Take a look around.
We'll be ready in a jiffy.

371
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,160
We're packing
hot dogs for the road.

372
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,640
You know, hot dogs get a bad rap.

373
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,400
They've got a cool shape,
they've got protein.

374
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,400
You like hot dogs, right?

375
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,600
By the way,
I think I know what's causing this.

376
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,440
You do?
- It's the plants.

377
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,640
They can release chemicals.

378
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,040
You like hot dogs, don't you?

379
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,400
Okay, babies, we are gonna be going,
but we will be back soon, okay?

380
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,200
Oh, plants react to human stimulus.
They've proved it in tests.

381
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,400
Did you get the mustard?

382
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,680
Don't look outside. Stop it!

383
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,960
Stop it! Just look at me!
Just keep looking at me!

384
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,520
Close the vents.

385
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,600
I'm gonna give you a math riddle, okay?
And you're gonna tell me the answer.

386
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,840
What?

387
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,400
How much would you have if I said
I would pay you a penny on the first day

388
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,040
and then two pennies on the second,
and then four pennies on the third day

389
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,040
and I just kept doubling it
and I did this for a month?

390
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,240
How much money would you have
at the end of the month?

391
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,560
Ten dollars.
- No, higher. Higher, higher.

392
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,720
Just keep looking at me.
Just keep looking at me.

393
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,720
Twenty dollars?

394
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,960
No, keep going. Keep going.

395
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,960
Thirty. It's thirty. It's $30.

396
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,840
I'm gonna tell you the answer.

397
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,400
It's over $10 million.

398
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,800
You'd have over $10 million
at the end of the month.

399
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,120
You want to hear another one?

400
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,560
<i>Water contamination has surfaced</i>
<i>as one of the many theories</i>

401
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,360
<i>being taken seriously as to the cause</i>
<i>of the events in the Northeast.</i>

402
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,440
We have to go through
this little community of homes.

403
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,560
Small town called Holcomb,
then we hit the highway.

404
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,800
From there,
we're 30 miles from the state line.

405
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,120
Are those dead animals up ahead?

406
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,240
Stop the car.

407
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,040
You don't think it's...
- I don't know.

408
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,680
You got binoculars in the back, from
when you were spying on our neighbors.

409
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,960
Can I have the map?

410
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,720
Elliot...

411
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,560
Don't cause a panic, okay?
Jess can hear you.

412
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,880
It's bodies, isn't it?
I knew it would be bodies.

413
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,040
How could it not be bodies?

414
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,240
Please, give me the map.

415
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,680
Well, we have to turn around.

416
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,600
There's a right turn
about a quarter of a mile back.

417
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,040
We're just gonna take a different route,
honey, okay?

418
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,760
Oh, it's the Army. We're safe!

419
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,400
My name is Private Auster.

420
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm stationed at West Dover Military Base,
about 10 miles back.

421
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,000
I think they've been affected
by whatever's happening.

422
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,800
I lost communication with them.

423
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,960
When I approached the base,

424
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,440
I saw military personnel
in the barbed wire, in the fence.

425
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,880
So I suggest no one take that road.

426
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,560
There's a town
about eight miles behind us.

427
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,400
There were bodies on the road into town.

428
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,280
Cheese and crackers.

429
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,040
Well, that still
leaves us two directions.

430
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,200
Just stop! Stop the vehicle!

431
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,920
What's going on?
- Is everyone all right?

432
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,720
We have no communication with anybody.

433
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,640
I'll talk to them.
- Did you see anything out of the ordinary?

434
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,600
Hello! Please stop!

435
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,200
Excuse me.

436
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,920
Who's Joey?

437
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,760
Oh, it's no one.

438
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,600
Any luck?

439
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,240
I can't get Julian
on his cell phone.

440
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,360
I'm sure he'll be all right.
They'll be okay.

441
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,280
Has anyone seen any other people
on the roads?

442
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,680
Maybe he's on to something.

443
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,440
What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

444
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,560
Why did it start in parks?

445
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,760
It's the same story.
About eight, nine miles back.

446
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,440
They say there's a bus in a lake.

447
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,040
Five miles back.
There were dozens of bodies.

448
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,800
Okay.

449
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,160
Nobody's going anywhere.
We're gonna stay right here for a while.

450
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,160
There's a woman
talking to her daughter.

451
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,680
She's talking to her
daughter in Princeton.

452
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,880
Isn't that where your friend went?

453
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,400
Come on.

454
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,920
It's okay.
Honey, it's okay.

455
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,880
She's so scared.

456
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,960
You just stay in that room.
You don't open the door for nothing.

457
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,200
Just keep watching out the window
with the tree, baby.

458
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,800
Someone will come and get you soon.

459
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,040
Tell her not to go near the window
with the tree. Just tell her.

460
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,960
Baby, don't go near the window
with the tree.

461
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,600
Ask her if Princeton's been affected.

462
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,840
Honey, someone wants to know
if Princeton's had any problems.

463
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,040
She says everyone's dead outside.

464
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,440
You just stay in your room.

465
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,640
Honey?

466
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,200
Honey, you're talking funny.
What's wrong with you?

467
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,800
What do you mean? Everyone's dead?
- What?

468
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,280
Stacy... Stacy, you're scaring me.

469
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,240
I don't understand what you're saying.

470
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,440
What, baby?

471
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,400
She's just not making any sense.

472
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,920
<i>Calculus.</i>

473
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,800
<i>I see in calculus.</i>

474
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,160
<i>Calculus.</i>

475
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Stacy!
<i>- Calculus.</i>

476
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,800
Stacy!

477
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,360
Stacy Ann!

478
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,040
Oh, my God.

479
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,080
I hear wind from outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

480
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,880
Stacy, Stacy, Stacy.

481
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,000
Oh, no!

482
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,320
We're going to go back to the car,
okay, Jess?

483
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,560
If we went down that road,
where would that take us?

484
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,120
I walked down a quarter mile,
it was clean.

485
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,960
I can't tell you what's after that,
but it was clean, no bodies, no nothing.

486
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,560
Quarter mile?
- That's not enough.

487
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,440
Hey, it's better than going back
the other way.

488
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,120
Get a battle plan.
Everybody makes a clean break.

489
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,440
Elliot's resilient, isn't he?

490
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,960
Yeah. He never gives up.

491
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,200
You know, plants have the ability
to target specific threats.

492
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,840
Tobacco plants,
when attacked by Heliothis caterpillars

493
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,720
will send out a chemical attracting
wasps to kill just those caterpillars.

494
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,360
We don't know how plants
attain these abilities.

495
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,600
They just evolve very rapidly.

496
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,720
Which species do you think is
doing it if you think it's true?

497
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,960
Plants have the ability to communicate
with other species of plants.

498
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,840
Trees can communicate with bushes,

499
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,880
bushes with grass
and everything in between.

500
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,360
The radio says these attacks
started happening in the cities

501
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,920
then went to the towns
and now the roads.

502
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,520
That's right.

503
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,280
Whatever's happening is happening
to smaller and smaller populations.

504
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
So we shouldn't be on the roads, then.

505
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,280
The terrorists, or whatever
could be watching the roads.

506
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,440
I don't have any reason
to disagree right now.

507
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,560
We are in the area of attack.

508
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,040
If you can't find a way
through the area of attack

509
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,880
we are told to find a safe zone
within the area being attacked.

510
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,480
They're attacking populations.

511
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,120
We need to go where there
aren't that many people.

512
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,280
Where people don't travel.

513
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,720
Now this is Mr. Collins.
He's a realtor that works in this area.

514
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,320
If we go west,
we'll hit a county called Arundell.

515
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,880
It's not on that map.

516
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,640
It would only be on local maps. Dirt roads.
Hardly anybody lives out there.

517
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,440
There's no significant population there.
That's our safe zone.

518
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,000
We wait it out there till it's over.
Is everyone in agreement?

519
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,240
We should go into two groups.

520
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,920
Those that are
ready to go right now

521
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,320
and those that need
to get things from their cars.

522
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,760
We need to stay in groups.
Stay together.

523
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,040
We'll go soon, honey.
We'll go soon.

524
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,480
Maybe we should've waited
for the rest of them,

525
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,560
stayed in a big group,
like the Private said.

526
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,080
Your phone's out, too?

527
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,800
What's wrong?

528
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,440
Okay. I was going to tell you, okay?

529
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,800
There was this guy, Joey.

530
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,160
His name is Joey.
He's at work.

531
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,800
We went out and we had dessert.

532
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,560
I went out and I had dessert with him
when I told you I worked late.

533
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,840
And I didn't work late.

534
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,680
I'm feeling really guilty
in case we're gonna die.

535
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,040
I just wanted you to know that.

536
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,360
You lied to me?

537
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,400
How much farther is it?
- I don't know.

538
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,480
We need to keep going forward.
- Who the hell made you boss?

539
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,280
Look, if y'all follow him, y'all gonna die.
You follow me, you're gonna live.

540
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,280
I'm in charge of this group!
Ain't nobody else in charge of this group!

541
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,640
My firearm is my friend!
It will not leave my side!

542
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,200
Private Auster?

543
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,600
My firearm is my friend.

544
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,080
Jesus.

545
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,720
Oh, no.

546
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,280
What, "Oh, no"?

547
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,520
The toxin?

548
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,760
The toxin is affecting them?

549
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,800
Are those people killing themselves?

550
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,560
You were with the Private.
What do we do?

551
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,640
We need to do something!
- Just let me think.

552
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,280
They're dying!
- I need a second.

553
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,840
They released it?
We're not near the roads.

554
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,240
We can't just stand here
as uninvolved observers!

555
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,640
I need a second, okay.
Just give me a second!

556
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,880
We are not going to be
one of those assholes on the news

557
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,800
who watches a crime happen
and not do something!

558
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,640
We're not assholes!
- Just a second!

559
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,880
There were children in that group!

560
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,600
Elliot, please tell us what to do.
- I need a second, okay!

561
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,800
Why can't anybody
give me a goddamn second?

562
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,400
All right, be scientific, douchebag.

563
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,320
Identify the variables.
That's the two groups.

564
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,320
Design an experiment.
That's what we're in.

565
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,240
Careful observation and measurements.
That's what I'm trying to do.

566
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,200
Interpret the experimental data.
Interpret.

567
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
What if it is the plants?

568
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,040
Their group was larger than ours.

569
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,040
This thing has been escalating all day.

570
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,840
Smaller and smaller populations
have been setting this off.

571
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,120
They react to human stimulus.

572
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,280
Maybe people are
setting off the plants?

573
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,720
What are you saying? That guy was crazy.
We have to save them.

574
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,960
They're already dead.

575
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,480
What if they're
targeting us as threats?

576
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,520
This part of the field
may not have been set off.

577
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,280
Something in this field could be
releasing the chemical into the air

578
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,160
when there's too
many of us together.

579
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,240
Let's just stay
ahead of the wind.

580
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,360
Let's just break up into groups.

581
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,960
Come on! Come on! This way!
Come on, follow me!

582
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,560
I'm right here! Keep going!
I'm right behind you!

583
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,400
Here it comes!

584
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,320
Don't you let go of my hand.

585
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,320
Nothing happened.

586
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,160
It's the size of the groups,
I think.

587
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,280
Could this really be happening?

588
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,280
What are your names?

589
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,840
Jared.
- Josh.

590
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,360
Wait, wait!

591
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,600
I'm going to go see if that truck
has a map. You guys wait here.

592
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,720
<i>Why aren't they looking</i>
<i>into nuclear power plants?</i>

593
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,080
<i>There are 15 or more</i>
<i>in the Northeast alone.</i>

594
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,480
<i>More than anywhere else</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

595
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,000
<i>There's probably been</i>
<i>some leak or something.</i>

596
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,400
<i>It's probably poisoning the air.</i>

597
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,480
There's a house over there! Come on!

598
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,280
It could have been
some terrorist booby-trap,

599
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,080
someone stepped on
it out in the field.

600
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,120
Yeah, in a field
in Bumbletown, Pennsylvania.

601
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,760
I don't know.

602
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,720
Look, a toxin dissipates quickly in the air.
They're only potent in a certain density.

603
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,240
The source had to be close to that field,
if not in the field.

604
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,800
Here's one.

605
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,920
Plants have the chemistry to do this.
They release co-transporters into the air.

606
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,080
You think it could be plants?

607
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,680
I don't know.

608
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,760
But if it is, and people are
setting it off in groups,

609
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,840
we need to go to the least
populated place we can to be safe.

610
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,160
We can't walk to the borders where this
isn't happening, Alma. It's too far.

611
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,360
Whatever it is, terrorists,
a nuclear leak, plants,

612
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,720
it's probably safe to get
away from people right now.

613
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,440
That must be Arundell.
It's 10 miles from here.

614
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,640
Okay, this place must have a bathroom.
I'm gonna take Jess, then we can leave.

615
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,040
Hurry.

616
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,200
Hello?

617
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,040
My name is Elliot Moore.

618
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,440
I'm just going to talk
in a very positive manner.

619
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,160
Giving off good vibes.

620
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,920
We're just here to use the bathroom
and then we're just gonna leave.

621
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,840
I hope that's okay.

622
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,440
Plastic.

623
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,640
I'm talking to a plastic plant.

624
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,840
I'm still doing it.

625
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,280
You guys ready to leave?

626
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,160
These people must have left in a hurry.
I mean, leaving the front door unlocked?

627
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,200
Hey, everything's fake.

628
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,520
Why is this happening?

629
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,600
I don't know for sure, Josh.

630
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,440
But I read this article
about the coast of Australia.

631
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,000
It said they found large quantities
of a primordial bacteria.

632
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,320
It hadn't been around for billions
of years, it just appeared in the water.

633
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,000
It's toxic to humans, fishermen
who come in contact with it are dying.

634
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,280
It feels kind of similar to that.

635
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,440
With the bees disappearing, I mean,
I don't know, it feels like a pattern.

636
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,840
The nature of events
like the one in Australia

637
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,440
is that they crest and then stop.

638
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,560
We just have to be
alive when it's over.

639
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,320
I don't believe it's nature.

640
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,480
It may not be. There could be some
other explanation. I don't know.

641
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,720
Let's go.

642
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,800
There are people coming!

643
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,680
We can't stay here. It's close to the roads.
More and more people will come here.

644
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,320
There's two groups coming together.

645
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,960
There's too many of them together.

646
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,600
Run. Run.

647
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,480
Is she your kid?
- No.

648
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,640
You got kids?
- No.

649
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,320
How come? You got a problem?

650
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,160
No. She wanted to wait.

651
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,880
Really? For what?

652
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Me to grow up.
Why are we talking about this?

653
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,240
Sweet. I used to love those.
Can I see it?

654
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,680
You need to take personal responsibility
for yourself in a relationship.

655
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,240
That'll make a difference.
- Okay. Thank you.

656
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,320
Hey, that's not a toy.
It's got meaning to me.

657
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,760
Elliot! Look!
- Come on.

658
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,840
Oh, wow.

659
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,560
<i>... is an emergency broadcast.</i>

660
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,080
<i>All those who are still inside</i>
<i>the affected area of the Northeast</i>

661
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:53,080
<i>are asked to proceed to the police</i>
<i>borders west of your state.</i>

662
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,720
Come on.

663
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,080
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

664
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,800
<i>... inside the affected area...</i>

665
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,400
Jess needs a 10-minute rest
and some food.

666
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,800
Are you sure?
We should keep going.

667
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,560
I know, but she's only eight.

668
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,680
What?

669
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,280
If we're going to die,
I want you to know something.

670
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,360
I was in the pharmacy a while ago,

671
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,320
and there was a really good-looking
pharmacist behind the counter.

672
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,920
Really good-looking.

673
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,400
And I went up and I asked her
where the cough syrup was.

674
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,640
I didn't even have a cough.

675
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,840
And I almost bought it.

676
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,360
And I'm talking about a completely
superfluous bottle of cough syrup.

677
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,600
That's like six bucks.

678
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,640
Are you joking?

679
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,920
Thank you.

680
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,520
Maybe that's not a good idea.
- I told her just for a minute.

681
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,760
Mr. Moore,
I think I can open this door.

682
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,400
Wait. We're a gang now?
We're gonna take whatever we want?

683
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,240
Come on, guys.
- Listen, nobody's home.

684
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,880
We're just gonna
get some food for Jess.

685
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,320
Yeah, and it looks like nobody's
lived here for a long time anyway.

686
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,200
I mean, it's all boarded up.

687
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,640
Maybe we could leave some money.

688
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,760
What kind of tree is this?
- I think it's a maple.

689
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,520
Not so high.

690
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,040
Okay, Josh, open the door.

691
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,040
Wait!

692
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,200
I see something.

693
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,000
There's somebody in there!
- You sure?

694
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,880
Yeah, I saw him move.

695
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,720
I see him!

696
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,760
Let's stop.

697
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,200
Is there any way we could get some food?
We have a little girl.

698
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,720
We just want to get her some food.
- You best leave now.

699
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,640
You ain't gonna bring that
poison gas in here with you.

700
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,400
Sir, it's not poison gas.
There's none out here.

701
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,600
They said to stay inside.
- We're fine right now.

702
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,600
Nothing's happened out here yet.

703
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,760
I mean, you can see that.
Just listen to our voices.

704
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,760
We're perfectly normal.

705
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,120
<i>Old black water,
keep on rolling</i>

706
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,560
<i>Mississippi moon</i>
<i>Won't you keep on shining on me?</i>

707
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,600
See? We're normal.

708
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,560
You ain't from around here.
You'd best leave now.

709
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,640
Okay. It's not worth it.

710
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,800
Open the door, bitch!

711
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,320
Hey, Josh, don't do that.
He didn't mean that!

712
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,320
There's more than one in there.
- Jess! Jess, come here.

713
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,000
Stop it, Jess. Listen, we just want some
food for a little girl, you pussies!

714
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,440
Jess, come here.
- Josh, stop it.

715
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,440
You'd best not let that gas in here.

716
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,640
Sir, the air is fine out here right now.
You don't need to worry.

717
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,200
You might be with the terrorists!
- I don't think it's terrorists, sir.

718
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,160
Josh, stop it!
- They're being crazy, Mr. Moore!

719
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,240
Show your faces!
- Let the gas in...

720
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,720
No!

721
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,400
Jared!

722
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,160
We're gonna get
out of this nightmare.

723
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,240
Elliot!

724
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,880
We have to go.
We have to protect Jess.

725
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,640
Okay?

726
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,920
You've got to three
to get off our porch!

727
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,760
Come here.

728
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,600
<i>No new people have crossed</i>
<i>over the border for a few hours.</i>

729
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,440
<i>It appears those residents that are still</i>
<i>in the affected area of the Northeast</i>

730
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,720
<i>are trying to wait it out.</i>

731
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,040
<i>We have Professor Kendel Wallace</i>
<i>of Carnegie Mellon,</i>

732
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,080
<i>a statistician, here with us.</i>
<i>Professor, what can you tell us?</i>

733
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,560
<i>Calculating by the rise in</i>
<i>intensity of reports of incidents</i>

734
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,160
<i>within the affected area,</i>
<i>one can guess at a crude timetable.</i>

735
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,560
<i>One can see the incident</i>
<i>is rising in sensitivity.</i>

736
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,280
<i>We've seen fewer and fewer people</i>
<i>can provoke the attacks.</i>

737
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,760
<i>The event should be at its most</i>
<i>sensitive tomorrow morning.</i>

738
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,520
<i>Typically, these type of slopes</i>
<i>drop precipitously after cresting,</i>

739
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,680
<i>meaning it could end suddenly,</i>
<i>at any moment.</i>

740
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,400
<i>Of course,
these are only probabilities.</i>

741
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,720
<i>There are some quiet rumblings</i>

742
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,360
<i>that the government may be</i>
<i>involved in the tragic events</i>

743
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,680
<i>playing out in the Northeast.</i>
<i>Now, these rumors have been fuelled</i>

744
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,440
<i>by the statements</i>
<i>of a confidential informant</i>

745
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,280
<i>who claims that the CIA</i>
<i>has facilities in the Northeast,</i>

746
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,280
<i>where they are testing drugs with</i>
<i>some similar psychotropic properties</i>

747
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,000
<i>as a defense against
chemical weapons.</i>

748
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,760
<i>CIA and White House officials</i>

749
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,720
<i>have declined to respond</i>
<i>to these accusations.</i>

750
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,000
<i>Perimeters have been set up</i>
<i>all along the East Coast</i>

751
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,880
<i>from Maryland</i>
<i>all the way to Massachusetts.</i>

752
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,920
This house has no power going to it.

753
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,040
Nobody's driven on this driveway
for a long time, either.

754
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,640
Let me go. You guys stay right here.

755
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,640
That's for Clement.

756
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,280
He's a retriever.

757
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,800
You lost?

758
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,280
You must be.

759
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,240
There ain't nothing
around here for miles.

760
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,200
Why are you eyeing my lemon drink?

761
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,440
I suppose the kind thing for me
to do is to offer you supper.

762
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,600
I ain't gonna ask you again.

763
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,800
I hope the meal was sufficient.

764
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,640
I wasn't expecting guests.

765
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,640
This is a beautiful place.

766
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,360
There's a springhouse in the back.

767
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,480
They used to hide people
from slave chasers back there.

768
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,960
It has a speaking tube running
under the ground to the main house.

769
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,400
You can hear each other
like you were in the same room.

770
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,160
So, what's with you two?

771
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,800
Who's chasing who?

772
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,880
I'm sorry?

773
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,800
Ain't no time two people staring
at each other, standing still,

774
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,080
love in both their eyes,
at the same time, equal.

775
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:52,000
Truth is, someone is chasing someone.

776
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,480
That's the way we's built.

777
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,360
So?

778
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,920
Who's chasing?

779
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,040
I knew that. I knew that.

780
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,840
Don't touch things that aren't yours.

781
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,560
Do you have a radio, Mrs. Jones?
- No.

782
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,440
I got enough to fill my time right here.

783
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:32,320
I mend my own things.
I grow my own food.

784
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,760
Although I ain't got the touch.

785
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,560
Gardens don't grow the way they should.
Never have.

786
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,360
How do you stay in contact with others?
- I don't.

787
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,160
How would you know if something
were to happen? Like a world event?

788
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,080
Mrs. Jones, something's happened
along the East Coast.

789
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,080
Whatever it is that
you think is so important

790
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,480
that you need to tell me, don't.

791
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,520
Just keep it to yourself.

792
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,960
The world don't care about me.
I don't care about it.

793
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,560
Suppose I have to
let you spend the night.

794
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,400
Guest room's up on the left.

795
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,000
Mind the steps.

796
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,920
I'm scared, Elliot.

797
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,480
It's okay.

798
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:54,200
I'm sorry about everything.
That Joey thing. I was being stupid.

799
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,920
You've been great taking care of Jess.

800
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,760
I don't like this woman.

801
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,520
There's something <i>Exorcist-y</i> about her.
How could she hit Jess like that?

802
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,040
Well, we need to stay in this house.

803
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,760
You want me to protect you,
this is how we have to do it.

804
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,840
Let's just deal with her.

805
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,720
I hear you whispering.

806
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,120
Planning on stealing something?

807
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,920
No, ma'am, we're not.

808
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,560
Plan on murdering me in my sleep?

809
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,320
What? No!

810
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,400
Mrs. Jones?

811
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,680
Mrs. Jones?

812
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,640
Crazy lady.

813
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,600
You trying to steal my things?

814
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,720
No! No, Mrs. Jones,
I actually wanted to talk with you.

815
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:53,120
You all are gonna leave right now!
- Ma'am, you don't understand.

816
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,840
There's something happening
in a few states, in this region.

817
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,280
It's not safe!
- Leave now!

818
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,080
The Lord is my shepherd.

819
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:22,040
The Lord is my shepherd.

820
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,720
Mrs. Jones,
could we talk calmly for a second?

821
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,000
Just hear me out.
See, I'm a teacher...

822
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,200
Mrs. Jones?

823
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,640
Oh, my God.

824
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,840
Alma, shut the windows
and the doors!

825
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,600
Alma?

826
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,600
Alma?

827
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,560
Alma?

828
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,440
Jess?

829
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,280
Hi, froggie! Hi, froggie!

830
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,920
Okay, yeah. Wait.

831
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,680
How old do you think he is?
Is he a baby? I think he's a baby.

832
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,320
He's so tiny.
I didn't know frogs could be like that.

833
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,640
Oh, he got water on my shoe.

834
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,560
Isn't this a cool house?

835
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,240
If we had this house,
we could make it look so pretty.

836
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,720
Get him again. Get him again.
Hey, froggie.

837
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,240
Alma?

838
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,400
Good morning, Elliot.
Sounds like you're right here.

839
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,440
Close the windows and the doors, Alma.
- Why?

840
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,480
Mrs. Jones just died.
Close the windows.

841
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,120
Close the door, Jess!

842
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,360
Is everything closed?
- Yes.

843
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:29,640
I'm sorry, Alma.
- What's going on, Elliot?

844
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,240
It's happening here.

845
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,240
It could be the grass and
the trees are doing this now.

846
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,120
She was alone when it happened.

847
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,400
Seems like they might have
gotten more sensitive.

848
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:45,600
It's too dangerous
to go outside, isn't it?

849
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,040
Yes.

850
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,840
This is the end, isn't it?

851
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,800
I wish you were here.

852
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,200
Me, too.

853
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,240
You remember our first date?

854
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,960
You were so quiet.

855
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,320
You bought me the mood ring.

856
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,520
It turned purple when you wore it.

857
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,920
Then you said,
"That means you're in love."

858
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,640
It got you to talk, didn't it?

859
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,400
Then we checked
the little paper chart,

860
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,640
and it turned out that
purple meant I was horny.

861
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,040
You loved that.
- I had no idea.

862
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,720
Yours was blue.
Peaceful, right?

863
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,200
Right.

864
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,600
What color was love?

865
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,400
I don't remember.

866
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,880
Me, neither.

867
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,800
Elliot?

868
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,960
Yeah?

869
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,720
I was just making
sure you're there.

870
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,960
It's not right for it to end like this.

871
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,360
If we're gonna die,
I want to be with you.

872
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,160
I want to be with you,
and I'm gonna come and be with you.

873
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,640
Elliot, don't!

874
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,560
<i>The event must have ended</i>
<i>before we went out there.</i>

875
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,400
I found the hair clip!

876
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:30,240
You don't want to be late
for the first day schools are open.

877
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,480
Oh, wait.

878
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,520
I'm just gonna put this right here.

879
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,240
Okay?

880
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,480
Are you okay?
- Yes, Aunt Alma. I love you.

881
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,920
I love you, too. Come here.

882
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:06,360
All right. I'll pick you up
after you're done with school, okay?

883
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,560
Bye.

884
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,720
<i>As everyone knows by now,</i>

885
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,040
<i>traces of the neurotoxin have been</i>
<i>found in some plants and trees.</i>

886
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,440
<i>Now, most environmentalists feel</i>

887
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:34,280
<i>that this event is like</i>
<i>the red tide in the ocean,</i>

888
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,600
<i>but instead of algae killing fish,</i>
<i>this happened on land.</i>

889
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,200
<i>Now, plants and trees</i>
<i>just can't pick up and move</i>

890
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,920
<i>when they feel threatened,</i>
<i>like other species.</i>

891
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
<i>They have only one option,</i>
<i>to rapidly evolve their chemistry.</i>

892
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,520
<i>Well.</i>

893
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,280
<i>Kay from Mississippi wants to know</i>
<i>why it started so suddenly,</i>

894
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:57,400
<i>on a Tuesday at 8:33 and then ended</i>
<i>so suddenly at 9:27 the next morning.</i>

895
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:02,480
<i>Well, Kay, to be perfectly honest,</i>
<i>this was an act of nature,</i>

896
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,920
<i>and we'll never fully understand it.</i>

897
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,480
<i>And, Doctor, there's been</i>
<i>a lot of speculation</i>

898
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,600
<i>as to why this happened</i>
<i>in the Northeast only.</i>

899
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,280
<i>How do you explain that?</i>

900
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,800
<i>Well, I believe, all right,</i>
<i>and this is just my opinion,</i>

901
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,560
<i>that this was a prelude, okay?</i>

902
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,800
<i>A warning,
like the first spot of a rash.</i>

903
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,960
<i>We have become
a threat to this planet.</i>

904
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,960
<i>I don't think anybody
will argue that.</i>

905
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,920
<i>And this is a warning.</i>
<i>- A warning?</i>

906
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,560
<i>I think the skeptics would believe that</i>
<i>if it had occurred anywhere else.</i>

907
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,120
<i>That's why most people</i>
<i>believe it was the government.</i>

908
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:37,080
<i>If it had happened in one other place,</i>
<i>anywhere else,</i>

909
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,400
<i>we could all believe
what you're saying.</i>

910
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,720
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.

911
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,960
Can you make Nadia's party tonight?

912
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,920
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.

913
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,320
That frightened me.

914
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,840
I should drop my bicycle off

915
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,040
What?

916
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,600
My God...

917
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,440
My bicycle.

918
01:22:04,040 --> 01:26:37,040
