1
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:09,804
Together we shall save our planet

2
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:13,334
or together we shall die in flames.

3
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:31,294
<i>First comes love,</i>

4
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:32,654
<i>then comes marriage,</i>

5
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,924
They always look like they're having more fun.

6
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:41,264
Everyone has more fun.

7
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:43,234
Obviously they have more fun than we do.

8
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:45,234
Have you seen Patricia?

9
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,764
They are huge!

10
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:48,294
She says she's gonna let me touch them.

11
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:49,334
Bullshit...

12
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:52,404
She said! She did! For a dollar.

13
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:55,004
To you? She said that to you?

14
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:57,514
Not exactly, not to me.

15
00:02:57,554 --> 00:02:58,644
Thought so.

16
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:02,224
Carl said you were faggot.

17
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:03,814
So?

18
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:05,324
So - he said you were fag.

19
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:07,954
Well, what are you gonna do?

20
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:10,124
Nothing.

21
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:12,564
You can't do nothing.

22
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:16,764
Some friend you are...

23
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:19,164
- Come on, fag!
- You're the fag!

24
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:21,264
Let's see what you got.

25
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:25,864
Fight, fight!

26
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:53,464
That's for setting me up.

27
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:13,724
What... are you... doing?

28
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:16,124
Nothing sister.

29
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:20,394
God smiles on remorseful, Mr Stafford,

30
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,924
not the impenitent.

31
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:56,834
Gentlemen, it's five o'clock.

32
00:04:56,874 --> 00:04:59,534
Detention is over.

33
00:05:03,614 --> 00:05:07,304
In the eyes of God all sinners can be redeemed.

34
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:09,244
Yes, sister.

35
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:12,644
My eyes see differently.

36
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,954
Yes, sister.

37
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:21,524
- Jimmy, I...
- Fuck you!

38
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:22,684
I didn't mean...

39
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:26,064
You're an asshole... Both of you.

40
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:15,534
Mom? Dad?

41
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:19,104
Son? You in there?

42
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,834
Yeah, I'm here.

43
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,204
You... working hard in there?

44
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:24,604
Leave him alone, Mike.

45
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:26,044
Poor son...

46
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:28,914
He'll go blind... grow hair on his palms...

47
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:32,474
Mike, he's 13... he's at age.

48
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:43,694
Hey, guys.

49
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:55,404
Roger, have you seen Patricia this morning?

50
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:57,434
She's very beautiful.

51
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:09,424
Mike?

52
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:10,644
Could you hurry up?

53
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:12,594
What's the rush? King gets arrested all the time.

54
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:13,954
I want a good seat.

55
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:40,774
<i>The Richmond Museum of Modern Art.</i>

56
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:49,654
<i>Your presence is requested at the White House</i>

57
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:50,984

63
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:19,544
Catherine.

64
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:42,504
Can I help you with something?

65
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:50,584
Yeah, I uh, I live across the street.

66
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:53,174
Yes?

67
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:56,514
I was wondering if you need

68
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:59,454
any work done. You know in the garden,

69
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:00,754
around the house.

70
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:02,594
I'm trying to earn some money.

71
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:03,724
For what?

72
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,824
A trip. To Europe.

73
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:07,294
With my class.

74
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:09,234
That sounds very adventurous.

75
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:11,764
Adam.
- Adam.

76
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,304
Are you coming in?

77
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:32,554
What can you do?
- What?

78
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:36,094
Around the house.

79
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:38,794
Oh. Cleaning, fits... All the usual stuff.

80
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,764
And you want me to pay you for that?

81
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:42,064
For my trip...

82
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:43,124
To Europe?

83
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:50,944
You know him? President Kennedy?

84
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:52,504
We've met...

85
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:57,814
My mom shook hands with him once, at a dinner.

86
00:12:57,854 --> 00:13:00,474
She said it made her feeling she was naked.

87
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:02,984
You father mustn't have liked that too much.

88
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:05,014
My dad said he stole the election

89
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:06,884
by being a pretty boy on a television.

90
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:09,294
What do you think?

91
00:13:09,324 --> 00:13:13,094
I don't know, I didn't see it.

92
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:33,614
I need my garden landscaped.

93
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:34,774
Can you do that?

94
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:36,014
Sure.

95
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:39,254
Have you ever do it before? Worked in a garden?

96
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,784
Then I'm not gonna pay you very much, am I?

97
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:44,654
I'm a fast learner.

98
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:46,354
I bet you are.

99
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:48,824
Come back tomorrow.

100
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:51,894
Right.

101
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,664
Tomorrow.

102
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:07,674
Made her feel like she was naked...

103
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,884
Shit.

104
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,164
Adam, dinner.

105
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:27,394
Alright!

106
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:28,734
Now, Adam, now.

107
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:30,794
I said I'm coming.

108
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:33,974
Just not while you're in the bathroom, right?

109
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:43,444
Adam.

110
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,154
Adam.

111
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:50,684
I said I'd be right there.

112
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:02,064
- Hey, Faith.
- Hi.

113
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:03,334
Hi, Patricia.

114
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:04,364
Dipshit.

115
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:06,504
Fuck off, Carl.

116
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:09,674
Right... fuck off.
- Okay.

117
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:18,384
I was just wondering if... you know

118
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:20,894
you'd want to come by my house sometime after school...

119
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:22,414
And do what?

120
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,924
I don't know.

121
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,294
Talk, listen to some records...

122
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:31,134
Yeah, I'd like that.

123
00:15:31,174 --> 00:15:32,534
Great, so...

124
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:36,804
Mr Stafford, is there a faintest possible reason

125
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:40,604
you might have for not being where you're supposed to be?

126
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:42,274
No, sister.

127
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:43,804
I thought not.

128
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:04,134
It's me, Adam... from next door.

129
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:06,764
- Your garden?
- Right.

130
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:08,204
I'm going to be your gardener...

131
00:16:18,254 --> 00:16:20,914
Who painted these?

132
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,444
I did.

133
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,214
Do you like them?

134
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:31,284
I think so, but... they're just colors, right?

135
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,424
You know, aren't they supposed to mean anything?

136
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:36,234
Color is color.

137
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:38,324
What do they mean?

138
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,274
Whatever you want them to.

139
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:43,294
Things are what we make of them.

140
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:45,774
- Form is dead.
- What?

141
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:47,574
Form is dead.

142
00:16:47,614 --> 00:16:49,874
Have you ever seen a man in building?

143
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:52,474
Broken windows, cracked doors and walls?

144
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:53,954
Sure.

145
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:56,644
From the moment that building was built

146
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,654
it started to fall apart,

147
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:01,024
just depends on how you choose to look at it.

148
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,854
Form is dead.

149
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:07,364
I like that.

150
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:14,004
Looks pretty good to me.

151
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:18,934
I want you to rip it all up.

152
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:22,564
All of it?

153
00:17:22,614 --> 00:17:24,084
Everything.

154
00:17:24,114 --> 00:17:27,744
Just scoop it up and throw it all away.

155
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:30,344
I want dirt, a new beginning,

156
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,724
nothing boxed or restrained.

157
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:36,484
Rip it all up, we'll start all over again.

158
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:38,364
Form is dead, right?

159
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:41,194
Exactly.

160
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:11,214
That might help.

161
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:15,504
You look... beautiful.

162
00:18:17,604 --> 00:18:19,234
I bet you say that to all the girls.

163
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:22,874
No.

164
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:26,744
Finish up that tree then head on home.

165
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:33,484
The Cubans are never gonna forgive Kennedy. Ever.

166
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:35,214
Well is not like it really matters.

167
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:39,154
We'll have communists living 90 miles away.

168
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:41,154
God, Castro laughs at us.

169
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:42,594
Laughs at us.

170
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:45,754
Well, you look like you've been digging to China.

171
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:47,354
Where've you been?

172
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,364
Working in the garden.

173
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:50,864
What garden?

174
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:52,234
Mrs. Caswell.

175
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:54,694
Who?

176
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:55,834
Mrs. Caswell.

177
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:57,674
She moved in across the street.

178
00:18:57,714 --> 00:19:00,174
Catherine Caswell?

179
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:01,904
M- hm.

180
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:03,344
Why won't you have a seat, bud?

181
00:19:11,654 --> 00:19:15,424
Catherine Caswell. She's very nice, isn't she?

182
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:16,554
Yeah, I like her.

183
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,024
She's a very special lady.

184
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:23,364
She is the one who has seen and done a lot of things.

185
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:24,664
Too many things.

186
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:26,634
She has had a very hard life,

187
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:30,304
she is... very emotional...

188
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:33,174
and maybe she's not the best person

189
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,334
for you to working for after school.

190
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,474
Why not?

191
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:41,384
Well, it isn't easy to explain.

192
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:44,014
She's different than we are, Adam.

193
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:47,824
She just doesn't care about the same things.

194
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:49,824
She doesn't care about her own son, for God's sake.

195
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:51,124
Addie.

196
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:52,394
She has a son?

197
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:54,834
Had a son. Had.

198
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:55,924
What happened?

199
00:19:55,964 --> 00:19:57,264
It doesn't matter what happened.

200
00:19:57,304 --> 00:20:01,764
What matters is that you stay away from her.

201
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:03,464
You said...

202
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:06,104
You said to get a job, to earn some money, you said...

203
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:07,874
Fine, get a job, just not with her...

204
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:11,284
Okay, Adam, working for her is alright.

205
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:12,474
Mike!

206
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:14,044
Just don't linger, okay?

207
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:16,484
Do what she asks, then come home.

208
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:21,114
Okay, buddy?

209
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:22,554
Okay.

210
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:25,894
What'd you do at school today?

211
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,264
Nothing.

212
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:31,764
Great.

213
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:36,504
All free men, where ever they may live

214
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:39,534
are citizens of Berlin,

215
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:42,444
and therefore as a free man,

216
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:48,444
I take pride in the words: Ich bin ein Berliner.

217
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:05,364
There are many people in the world

218
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:10,034
that really don't understand... or say they don't

219
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:15,134
what is the difference between the free world

220
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:17,744
and the communist world.

221
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:21,654
Let them come to Berlin.

222
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:09,494
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

223
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:48,234
What?

224
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:52,674
So you and the president really are friends.

225
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,314
Of course we are.

226
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:57,904
We met at school.

227
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:03,284
What's that supposed to mean?

228
00:23:03,324 --> 00:23:05,484
I was looking out my window last night and...

229
00:23:05,524 --> 00:23:06,684
And saw nothing.

230
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:09,454
You saaw absolutely nothing.

231
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:11,794
Okay, sorry...

232
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:20,834
There are some things, Adam, that are private.

233
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:23,234
And they should stay that way.

234
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,304
Like your son?

235
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:33,374
Who told you about my son?

236
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:34,854
My parents.

237
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:37,254
Your parents...

238
00:23:38,394 --> 00:23:39,884
Oh my God...

239
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:43,414
If you had a son, then you must have a husband, right?

240
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:46,954
Ex husband.

241
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:49,994
What's he like?

242
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:52,024
He's gone, that's what he's like.

243
00:23:56,604 --> 00:24:00,704
He was a, a little boy.

244
00:24:00,744 --> 00:24:01,944
Just like you.

245
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:04,644
I'm not a little boy.

246
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:10,144
No, I don't suppose you are.

247
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:15,314
Where are you going?

248
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:18,884
Like if that's any of your business.

249
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:35,204
He won't talk to anyone at Langley, Catherine?

250
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:38,744
Jack won't talk about it.

251
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:41,244
He says it's over and done with.

252
00:25:41,284 --> 00:25:42,544
Perhaps you need to convince him

253
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,744
that the conversation must remain open.

254
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:50,084
- He said that Bobby said...
- Christ!

255
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:51,454
Bobby.

256
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:12,304
Air support.

257
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:15,504
That's what it was: lack of air support.

258
00:26:17,114 --> 00:26:21,744
Well it's always easy to second guess desicion once it's been made.

259
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,774
Especially when it's the wrong decision.

260
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:26,014
We are talking about the man who stood in front of the wall

261
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:29,754
and mispronounced "Berliner".

262
00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:34,254
Ich bin ein Berliner: We are all jelly dougnuts.

263
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:37,724
My God, can we talk about something else, please?

264
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:38,824
It's Washington.

265
00:26:38,874 --> 00:26:40,664
What else is there to talk about?

266
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:42,974
Life maybe?

267
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:46,534
Life? There is life outside politics?

268
00:26:46,574 --> 00:26:48,974
There is nothing outside politics.

269
00:27:22,914 --> 00:27:24,774
Catherine Caswell.

270
00:27:24,814 --> 00:27:27,714
You should've seen him. He came home full of mud.

271
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:29,614
Like he was in the Bay of Pigs.

272
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:34,084
The Boy Pigs.

273
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:41,164
Form is dead.

274
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,944
Hey.
- Hey.

275
00:27:58,984 --> 00:28:00,844
We're going to your house, right?

276
00:28:00,884 --> 00:28:03,014
Yeah, great. Definitely.

277
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:07,184
Hey, guys. Ready to go?

278
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:08,524
Magda's gonna come with us.

279
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:09,994
That's okay, isn't it?

280
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:12,124
Sure.

281
00:28:12,164 --> 00:28:14,154
- I guess...
- Let go.

282
00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:30,484
Cool house.

283
00:28:30,514 --> 00:28:32,274
What do your parents do?

284
00:28:32,314 --> 00:28:35,254
They're writers. Journalists.

285
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:36,484
My mom's a writer...

286
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:37,984
cook books.

287
00:28:38,024 --> 00:28:41,224
Cool.

288
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:43,524
You guys just pretend I'm not here.

289
00:28:51,974 --> 00:28:53,464
I'm not here.

290
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:02,004
What was that?

291
00:29:02,044 --> 00:29:07,504
It's kissing, you stupid. French kissing.

292
00:29:07,554 --> 00:29:08,954
I went to France once.

293
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:11,114
So you should know how to do this.

294
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:13,554
Of course.

295
00:29:21,504 --> 00:29:23,624
What... is that?

296
00:29:28,104 --> 00:29:29,904
It's uh... my tooth.

297
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:35,044
That is completely disgusting...

298
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:37,814
I've gotta go.

299
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:41,184
My mom's gonna pick me up.

300
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,484
Yeah, we better.

301
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:51,084
Call me when you have it fixed.

302
00:29:58,034 --> 00:30:00,804
You broke a tooth and you weren't gonna tell us about it?

303
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,304
I glued it back in.

304
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:03,674
You glued it?

305
00:30:03,704 --> 00:30:05,434
I thought it would be okay.

306
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:08,074
This isn't a baby tooth, Adam. These don't grow back.

307
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:09,234
I know that.

308
00:30:09,284 --> 00:30:11,014
Then why didn't you tell us?

309
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:14,544
I don't know.

310
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:15,574
What is wrong with you?

311
00:30:15,624 --> 00:30:17,614
Nothing is wrong with me.

312
00:30:17,654 --> 00:30:19,684
What is that supposed to mean?

313
00:30:19,724 --> 00:30:21,694
Every day you come home dirty

314
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,254
after working in that woman's garden.

315
00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:24,454
- You spent all the time alone in your room...
- You said...

316
00:30:24,494 --> 00:30:25,524
- You spent all the time alone in your room...

317
00:30:25,564 --> 00:30:27,694
- Because you...
- You don't talk to us anymore.

318
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:29,354
It's your tooth, for God's sake.

319
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:31,464
My tooth! My tooth.

320
00:30:38,444 --> 00:30:39,434
What was that?

321
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:41,244
I have no idea.

322
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:48,814
Well... we'll call the dentist in the morning.

323
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:49,744
Society girls and Washington wives.

324
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:56,044
Nero feels... Rome burns.

325
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,494
Who the fuck are you?

326
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:06,624
It isn't safe to ignore people in the dark kid.

327
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:11,524
You didn't answer my question.

328
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:14,624
Oh, you like to sneak around, is that what you like to do?

329
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:16,804
You like to watch?

330
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:19,244
You like to sneak around and watch?

331
00:32:19,274 --> 00:32:21,074
How about I put you in jail?

332
00:32:21,114 --> 00:32:24,514
Let other people watch you for a while.

333
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:27,044
You can't put me in jail.

334
00:32:27,084 --> 00:32:28,914
Oh no?

335
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:30,644
You're not a cop.

336
00:32:30,684 --> 00:32:32,554
What makes you say that?

337
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:33,574
You're drunk.

338
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:38,114
Drunks come in all shapes and sizes, kid.

339
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,994
Come on.

340
00:32:49,874 --> 00:32:54,004
So this is what a journey to higher consciousness looks like?

341
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:55,304
Hello, Graham.

342
00:32:57,514 --> 00:32:59,574
Pathetic...

343
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:00,844
Look at you.

344
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:04,984
I found this peeping tom outside.

345
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:09,154
- Hi, Adam.
- Hi.

346
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:12,594
Oh. You know him...

347
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:15,964
He's doing some work for me... in the garden.

348
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:18,094
In the garden...

349
00:33:19,134 --> 00:33:22,624
Looks like Vietnam. Post napalm.

350
00:33:22,674 --> 00:33:24,764
Don't you like it?

351
00:33:24,804 --> 00:33:26,334
No.

352
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:27,604
Good.

353
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:29,634
I think I'm gonna go.

354
00:33:29,684 --> 00:33:30,674
Why?

355
00:33:32,414 --> 00:33:35,714
It's nice to have a man around the house.

356
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:39,654
What the fuck are you laughing at?

357
00:33:39,694 --> 00:33:40,714
What!

358
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:47,184
Go upstairs. I'll be up in a minute.

359
00:34:02,514 --> 00:34:05,004
What happened to you?

360
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,204
Where did you go?

361
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:12,214
I'm right here, Graham,

362
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:14,694
just like always.

363
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:17,164
You made a promise to me...

364
00:34:17,194 --> 00:34:20,684
and Harris.

365
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:23,224
You said you'd take care of us,

366
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:26,064
even after he...

367
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:33,344
We could have had another kid.

368
00:34:33,374 --> 00:34:35,074
We were still a family.

369
00:34:40,554 --> 00:34:42,284
People see you...

370
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:46,154
It's not as if it's a secret

371
00:34:46,194 --> 00:34:47,684
Going in and out of the White House.

372
00:34:47,724 --> 00:34:49,214
They see you, Catherine.

373
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:50,754
Why do you care?

374
00:34:50,794 --> 00:34:52,224
- You're my wife.
- Was!

375
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:54,734
Was your wife.

376
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:59,394
Everyone knows...

377
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:01,424
and they laugh about it.

378
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,804
And you know why?

379
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:05,574
Cause you're not the only one, Catherine.

380
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:09,274
He's got a string of women and he fucks them all.

381
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:10,974
Every last one of them.

382
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:14,714
You can't hurt me anymore, Graham.

383
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:19,454
Not you, not your government,

384
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:22,924
your precious agents.

385
00:35:22,964 --> 00:35:25,694
None of it can touch me.

386
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:32,734
He was my son too...

387
00:35:32,774 --> 00:35:35,104
Was he?

388
00:37:00,524 --> 00:37:02,014
Tough day at the office?

389
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:04,624
I got Cubans running around south Florida and Louisiana,

390
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:07,894
just looking to shoot someone. Idiots with guns.

391
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,734
Well I told you the anticomunism brigade won't work.

392
00:37:11,764 --> 00:37:14,604
They all want back in on their own terms.

393
00:37:14,634 --> 00:37:18,574
Almost like a marriage gone bad, wouldn't you say?

394
00:37:20,714 --> 00:37:21,874
Almost...

395
00:37:25,614 --> 00:37:27,344
You trained her very well.

396
00:37:27,384 --> 00:37:28,684
She was an Agency wife.

397
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:30,814
Is she going to be a liability?

398
00:37:36,494 --> 00:37:38,684
She writes everything down.

399
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:40,694
She always has, in a diary.

400
00:37:41,894 --> 00:37:45,194
I would've thought you'd've broken that sort of a habit.

401
00:37:45,234 --> 00:37:46,964
You try break it, we'll see how far you get.

402
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:54,374
Mr Del Valle, how are you?

403
00:37:54,414 --> 00:37:59,174
Every morning when I wake up I think of Fidel laughing at us.

404
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:01,314
Laughing and laughing behind his cojiba.

405
00:38:01,354 --> 00:38:03,114
It's not funny though, is it?

406
00:38:03,154 --> 00:38:06,454
Much like that playboy Kennedy, he laughs at us too.

407
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:08,324
You know Mr. Caswell, of course?

408
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:10,524
Yes, of course.

409
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:13,024
We must act sooner rather than later.

410
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,364
Bay of Pigs.

411
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:02,234
Oh boy...

412
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:07,064
<i>What do those secret service agents think when</i>

413
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:10,744
<i>they're waiting outside while Jack and I are swinging?</i>

414
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:13,614
<i>He doesn't trust Lucian, not anymore.</i>

415
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:16,114
<i>It's only Bobby now.</i>

416
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:20,384
You should have seen your face in light, Charlie.

417
00:40:20,424 --> 00:40:23,354
I was to worried about your hands...

418
00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:24,794
You're in a hurry.

419
00:40:24,824 --> 00:40:26,724
Things to see, places to go.

420
00:40:26,764 --> 00:40:27,924
People too.

421
00:40:27,964 --> 00:40:29,454
Exactly.

422
00:40:32,504 --> 00:40:34,974
Look at you...

423
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:37,064
I didn't invite you over to look.

424
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:19,144
So soon?

425
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:21,484
Helene is making dinner, quail or something.

426
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:22,574
I promised I'll be there.

427
00:41:22,624 --> 00:41:25,024
Give her my love.

428
00:41:25,054 --> 00:41:27,284
She read that Huxley book you suggested.

429
00:41:27,324 --> 00:41:28,654
Didn't like it.

430
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,684
No surprises there.

431
00:41:38,504 --> 00:41:39,834
I could leave her, you know?

432
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:41,864
For me?

433
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:46,604
Don't bother...

434
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:48,274
My quail needs work.

435
00:41:55,084 --> 00:41:56,074
Have a nice dinner!

436
00:42:07,294 --> 00:42:10,894
You left your book there on the floor, dead giveaway.

437
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:25,904
I'm um, I'm sorry...

438
00:42:27,454 --> 00:42:30,074
There's no rain, so I'll just go home.

439
00:42:32,554 --> 00:42:34,044
Sit down.

440
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:42,254
Never be ashamed being excited, Adam.

441
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,594
Just don't do it again.

442
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:49,794
I won't.

443
00:42:53,244 --> 00:42:54,604
I saw your husband today.

444
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:56,404
How exciting for you.

445
00:42:56,444 --> 00:42:59,244
He was with another guy, in a dirty suit.

446
00:42:59,284 --> 00:43:01,444
They were talking about you.

447
00:43:01,484 --> 00:43:04,714
They met somebody, guy with an accent.

448
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:06,454
"Del" something.

449
00:43:06,494 --> 00:43:08,824
Del Valle? Was that his name?

450
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:11,914
Yeah, that's him.

451
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,554
Who is he?

452
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:16,894
He's a Cuban. Very angry Cuban.

453
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:19,334
Some people think he's a patriot,

454
00:43:19,374 --> 00:43:20,804
other think he's a criminal.

455
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:23,464
I guess that'd depend on your point of view.

456
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:25,034
That's right.

457
00:43:25,074 --> 00:43:27,044
That's exactly right.

458
00:43:27,074 --> 00:43:29,304
You need to go now.

459
00:43:29,344 --> 00:43:32,574
See you tomorrow.

460
00:43:32,614 --> 00:43:36,744
Adam, if you see my husband again,

461
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,914
go in the other direction.

462
00:43:58,174 --> 00:43:59,504
Oval Office.

463
00:43:59,544 --> 00:44:01,974
This is Catherine Caswell. Can you put me through, please?

464
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,814
One moment, please.

465
00:44:04,844 --> 00:44:07,814
I'm sorry, Ms. Caswell, the president is on the phone.

466
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:08,874
I'll wait.

467
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:10,714
It may take some time.

468
00:44:10,754 --> 00:44:12,224
It's important.

469
00:44:12,254 --> 00:44:15,524
Well I believe he will be on the phone longer than you are willing to wait.

470
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:17,044
May I take a message?

471
00:44:17,094 --> 00:44:18,894
No. No, no message.

472
00:44:23,134 --> 00:44:25,864
Just boast...

473
00:44:25,904 --> 00:44:27,594
Don't fuck this up, Jack.

474
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:29,334
This was the night when Cuban prisoners

475
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:32,174
finally came back from the Bay of Pigs.

476
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:35,374
They flew into Miami after 20 months of captivity

477
00:44:35,414 --> 00:44:38,214
Finally freed by Fidel Castro

478
00:44:38,244 --> 00:44:41,914
for a ransom of $ 53 million in food and medicines.

479
00:44:41,954 --> 00:44:44,584
How will these returning prisoners be absorbed

480
00:44:44,624 --> 00:44:47,714
into the restless Cuban-American community?

481
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:49,054
Adam,

482
00:44:49,094 --> 00:44:51,824
hurry up, he'll here be any minute.

483
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:00,464
Doofus.

484
00:45:06,844 --> 00:45:08,534
Walter's driving you.

485
00:45:08,574 --> 00:45:10,804
- Walter?
- Jason's dad.

486
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:14,714
We'll be home late so just, get yourself to bed

487
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,514
And if anyone, and I mean anyone

488
00:45:17,554 --> 00:45:20,184
is drinking at this party, I want you out of there.

489
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:21,744
Have Jason call his father.

490
00:45:21,794 --> 00:45:23,254
Ok, mom.

491
00:45:23,294 --> 00:45:25,354
And don't think I won't find about it mister

492
00:45:25,394 --> 00:45:26,984
because I will. Clear?

493
00:45:27,034 --> 00:45:28,294
Clear.

494
00:45:30,434 --> 00:45:31,424
Bye, Dad.

495
00:45:33,134 --> 00:45:35,294
Bye, son.

496
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:38,234
Adam...

497
00:45:39,314 --> 00:45:41,434
Have fun!

498
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:46,944
Jimmy, cut the shit.

499
00:45:46,984 --> 00:45:47,974
What?

500
00:45:48,014 --> 00:45:49,674
Too scared to play.

501
00:45:49,724 --> 00:45:50,844
Am not.

502
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:53,414
Shut up and sit down.

503
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:54,614
Ready?

504
00:45:59,794 --> 00:46:01,494
Adam, see that you get ready.

505
00:46:01,534 --> 00:46:03,194
Adam...

506
00:46:03,234 --> 00:46:04,994
Here we go...

507
00:46:09,404 --> 00:46:10,564
Damn it, Jimmy.

508
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:11,594
What?

509
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:14,804
Such a boy.

510
00:46:14,844 --> 00:46:17,214
Faith, one minute.

511
00:46:17,244 --> 00:46:19,734
60 long seconds.

512
00:46:19,784 --> 00:46:28,454
Adam and Faith. Adam and Faith.

513
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,084
And Adam Faith.

514
00:46:30,124 --> 00:46:37,094
60, 59, 58, 57, 56...

515
00:46:37,134 --> 00:46:39,624
French, right?

516
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:40,834
Right.

517
00:46:48,144 --> 00:46:49,904
You got your tooth fixed.

518
00:46:49,944 --> 00:46:52,104
- Yeah.
- I can tell.

519
00:46:57,784 --> 00:46:59,274
Adam.

520
00:47:10,334 --> 00:47:11,324
Faith.

521
00:47:16,744 --> 00:47:19,474
Adam Stafford's an asshole.

522
00:48:08,024 --> 00:48:09,394
Are you okay?

523
00:48:09,424 --> 00:48:11,724
I'm planting.

524
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,524
I thought you said we had to wait till after the rain?

525
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:18,734
After, during, whatever.

526
00:48:20,704 --> 00:48:22,034
You must be cold.

527
00:48:26,044 --> 00:48:28,034
You have no idea...

528
00:48:30,584 --> 00:48:32,414
Why is the music so loud?

529
00:48:32,444 --> 00:48:34,414
I was painting.

530
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:36,814
I can hear it from across the street.

531
00:48:39,154 --> 00:48:40,884
Want one?

532
00:48:40,924 --> 00:48:42,184
Sure.

533
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:01,404
You should go home.

534
00:49:02,644 --> 00:49:04,634
I wanna paint with you.

535
00:49:09,454 --> 00:49:11,114
So let's paint.

536
00:49:48,454 --> 00:49:51,694
What do you think?

537
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,724
Not bad.

538
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:09,974
Not bad...

539
00:50:16,554 --> 00:50:18,214
Form is dead.

540
00:50:18,254 --> 00:50:20,244
That's right.

541
00:51:46,044 --> 00:51:47,704
I think I'm done.

542
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:34,924
Texas? For Thanksgiving?

543
00:52:34,954 --> 00:52:36,284
I have to go.

544
00:52:38,564 --> 00:52:41,084
If I don't go, then I'm not gonna get a raise.

545
00:52:41,134 --> 00:52:42,394
You know they like it when you're out there...

546
00:52:42,434 --> 00:52:44,364
...doing things, I know Mike.

547
00:52:44,404 --> 00:52:46,864
It's just...

548
00:52:52,144 --> 00:52:54,164
Adam is...

549
00:52:57,184 --> 00:52:58,734
I can't do it alone.

550
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:03,614
And Texas... I mean Dallas is a shithole.

551
00:53:03,654 --> 00:53:07,314
It'll just be for a few days.

552
00:53:08,824 --> 00:53:11,854
And I will try to make it home for the Thanksgiving supper.

553
00:53:17,134 --> 00:53:18,964
Well. I'm gonna go wake him up.

554
00:53:19,004 --> 00:53:20,564
He sleeps like the dead these days.

555
00:53:20,604 --> 00:53:22,504
It's hormones. Probably slumming through the roof

556
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:25,404
at their party last night.

557
00:53:28,614 --> 00:53:29,944
Adam, time to get...

558
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:35,244
Mike. Mike, get up here.

559
00:53:38,454 --> 00:53:40,154
Look at this.

560
00:53:41,694 --> 00:53:42,854
Hi, Dad.

561
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:47,924
What, am I supposed to do about this? What?

562
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:52,494
It's not that big of a deal, Mom.

563
00:53:52,534 --> 00:53:57,204
You have paint all over you!

564
00:53:57,244 --> 00:53:58,734
In the shower, right now!

565
00:53:58,774 --> 00:54:01,504
Do not come out until every speck of paint is gone.

566
00:54:01,544 --> 00:54:04,874
And then we'll discuss cleaning your room.

567
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:06,434
Okay, mom.

568
00:54:06,484 --> 00:54:07,884
Now!

569
00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:29,964
It's that woman, Catherine Caswell.

570
00:54:30,004 --> 00:54:32,774
This has got to stop Mike. This has got to stop.

571
00:54:32,804 --> 00:54:35,334
Alright, I'll talk to her this afternoon.

572
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:37,774
You will talk to her now. Right now.

573
00:54:37,814 --> 00:54:39,174
- Addie...
- Now.

574
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:41,044
Alright, just let me go finish the...

575
00:54:41,084 --> 00:54:43,574
Now!

576
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:56,284
Hello.
- Hi.

577
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,734
I'm uh...

578
00:54:58,764 --> 00:55:00,604
Mike Stafford, with The Star, I know?

579
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:04,074
I quite enjoyed your last piece on Dr. King.

580
00:55:04,104 --> 00:55:09,564
Though... you didn't exactly seem symphatetic, did you?

581
00:55:09,614 --> 00:55:11,874
Carver, Lucian Carver.

582
00:55:13,854 --> 00:55:15,714
The Lucian Carver?

583
00:55:15,754 --> 00:55:17,614
Fame is fleeting,

584
00:55:17,654 --> 00:55:20,984
But in Washington we take what we can get.

585
00:55:21,024 --> 00:55:22,994
Won't you come in?

586
00:55:23,024 --> 00:55:24,424
Please.

587
00:55:24,464 --> 00:55:28,364
A little early for company, isn't it, Lucian?

588
00:55:28,394 --> 00:55:29,864
Best behaviour, my dear.

589
00:55:29,904 --> 00:55:33,354
This is your neighbor, Mike Stafford.

590
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:34,394
Drink?

591
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:37,104
It's a little early...

592
00:55:37,144 --> 00:55:38,904
Should you have a drink, Catherine?

593
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:40,914
It's my house, Michael.

594
00:55:40,944 --> 00:55:43,344
Have a drink.

595
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,374
Vodka.

596
00:55:48,414 --> 00:55:49,514
Rocks.

597
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:06,364
Jesus, Lucian, don't play with him.

598
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:09,134
Just give him a drink.

599
00:56:09,174 --> 00:56:10,194
How's a boy?

600
00:56:10,244 --> 00:56:12,334
Boy?

601
00:56:14,074 --> 00:56:15,874
Your son, Adam.

602
00:56:17,084 --> 00:56:18,514
How is he?

603
00:56:18,544 --> 00:56:21,574
Uh, he's fine.

604
00:56:21,614 --> 00:56:23,554
He's great. The usual.

605
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:26,024
Good! Good.

606
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:30,354
That's what we all work for, isn't it?

607
00:56:30,394 --> 00:56:31,484
The children.

608
00:56:31,524 --> 00:56:34,584
The future.

609
00:56:34,634 --> 00:56:35,994
I suppose so.

610
00:56:36,034 --> 00:56:38,154
How was your childhood, Lucian?

611
00:56:38,204 --> 00:56:41,434
Somehow I don't see you laughing and playing in the meadows.

612
00:56:45,774 --> 00:56:47,504
It was fine.

613
00:56:47,544 --> 00:56:49,404
Great.

614
00:56:49,444 --> 00:56:50,474
The usual.

615
00:56:53,484 --> 00:56:54,574
Mike,

616
00:56:54,614 --> 00:56:58,524
is this a social visit or did you actually want something?

617
00:56:58,554 --> 00:57:01,544
No... uh, yes, actually it has to do with Adam.

618
00:57:01,594 --> 00:57:06,354
Addie, my wife, she worries maybe too much,

619
00:57:06,394 --> 00:57:09,124
but she worries about how much time he's been spending over here

620
00:57:09,164 --> 00:57:11,894
and he's starting to neglect his school work.

621
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:16,704
And the thing with the... the paint this morning...

622
00:57:16,744 --> 00:57:20,104
If your wife wants him to stop working for me

623
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:21,734
consider it done.

624
00:57:21,774 --> 00:57:22,804
Simple as that?

625
00:57:22,844 --> 00:57:24,814
Simple as that.

626
00:57:24,844 --> 00:57:26,644
It sure was a pleasure to meet you, Mike.

627
00:57:26,684 --> 00:57:28,844
I'll be looking forward to you next piece.

628
00:57:29,854 --> 00:57:32,214
Yes, great.

629
00:57:32,254 --> 00:57:34,184
Thanks.

630
00:57:35,854 --> 00:57:37,524
Have fun in Texas!

631
00:57:39,024 --> 00:57:41,524
Nice to meet you both.

632
00:57:47,034 --> 00:57:48,564
You don't have to scare him.

633
00:57:48,604 --> 00:57:51,574
I suppose not.

634
00:57:51,604 --> 00:57:53,664
But you enjoyed it.

635
00:57:53,714 --> 00:57:57,444
There are some perks that come with the job

636
00:57:57,484 --> 00:57:59,314
That I do admit.

637
00:57:59,344 --> 00:58:01,404
Scaring people?

638
00:58:01,454 --> 00:58:04,574
Forcing them to do things they don't wanna do?

639
00:58:04,624 --> 00:58:07,384
Sometimes what seems like the worst choice,

640
00:58:07,424 --> 00:58:09,324
is actually the best.

641
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:15,594
There's nothing I can do, Lucian.

642
00:58:15,634 --> 00:58:20,094
Catherine, your friend Jack won't talk to me,

643
00:58:20,134 --> 00:58:23,534
won't in fact talk to anyone inside the agency.

644
00:58:23,574 --> 00:58:26,634
You're our only connection to the Oval Office.

645
00:58:26,674 --> 00:58:29,044
He's made it abundantly clear:

646
00:58:29,074 --> 00:58:32,074
no talking,

647
00:58:32,114 --> 00:58:34,174
no fucking,

648
00:58:34,214 --> 00:58:36,444
no nothing. It's over.

649
00:58:36,484 --> 00:58:38,784
- I need to warn you.
- About what?

650
00:58:38,824 --> 00:58:41,084
The situation is very fluid.

651
00:58:41,124 --> 00:58:43,554
If he refuses to deal with Cuba,

652
00:58:43,594 --> 00:58:46,284
then Cuba is going to deal with him.

653
00:58:46,324 --> 00:58:47,764
What's that supposed to mean?

654
00:58:47,794 --> 00:58:49,354
There is pressure on me too...

655
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,834
He could be in danger.

656
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:57,304
He's the president, for God's sake.

657
00:58:57,344 --> 00:59:00,174
He's a man and men make mistakes

658
00:59:00,214 --> 00:59:03,234
which they have to own up to. And correct them.

659
00:59:03,284 --> 00:59:05,874
Things have to change, Catherine,

660
00:59:05,914 --> 00:59:08,854
or else things will really change.

661
00:59:10,484 --> 00:59:13,014
It's all a game of chess isn't it?

662
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:16,454
Playing out the pawns in you head.

663
00:59:18,164 --> 00:59:21,134
Should I sacrifice the rook? Or the king?

664
00:59:24,634 --> 00:59:27,604
Will you sacrifice me?

665
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:30,364
Catherine, I'm your son's godfather.

666
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:33,204
My son is dead.

667
00:59:33,244 --> 00:59:34,364
Where does that leave you?

668
00:59:34,414 --> 00:59:35,404
He was a lovely boy.

669
00:59:35,444 --> 00:59:37,414
- Graham was...
- Get out!

670
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:29,454
This is Catherine Caswell. Is he...

671
01:00:32,134 --> 01:00:33,794
No, no message.

672
01:00:35,734 --> 01:00:38,674
Carver. Lucian Carver. Adrienne, he knew Adam's name.

673
01:00:38,704 --> 01:00:40,674
He knew what I've been writing, he knew I'm going to Texas.

674
01:00:40,714 --> 01:00:42,144
He's with the C.I.A.?

675
01:00:42,174 --> 01:00:44,944
Yeah, he's with C.I.A. the way that Stalin was with the Communist Party.

676
01:00:44,984 --> 01:00:47,814
He is the C.I.A.: special ops, Castro, Lumumba, all of it.

677
01:00:47,854 --> 01:00:49,944
What is uh, what's for breakfast?

678
01:00:49,984 --> 01:00:51,354
Sit your ass down.

679
01:00:51,384 --> 01:00:53,044
- Dad, I...
- Sit!

680
01:00:56,454 --> 01:00:59,054
Okay, number one, you're gonna have no more contact

681
01:00:59,094 --> 01:01:01,964
with that Caswell woman, none, zero, zilch, ever.

682
01:01:01,994 --> 01:01:04,154
- Dad...
- Number two, you're grounded.

683
01:01:04,204 --> 01:01:06,104
- Why?
- Because I said so.

684
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:07,604
And number three, while I'm gone,

685
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:09,264
your mother's gonna be working from home

686
01:01:09,304 --> 01:01:11,294
and you're gonna be at school or you're gonna be here

687
01:01:11,344 --> 01:01:12,534
nowhere elsewhere, clear?

688
01:01:12,574 --> 01:01:13,704
What happened?

689
01:01:13,744 --> 01:01:16,644
School, here nowhere else.

690
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:18,144
Clear?

691
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:21,014
Clear.

692
01:01:23,624 --> 01:01:25,814
Eggs ok?

693
01:01:25,854 --> 01:01:27,584
Eggs it is.

694
01:02:49,874 --> 01:02:50,864
May I help you, madam?

695
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:52,344
Catherine Caswell.

696
01:02:52,374 --> 01:02:54,034
Yes, madam.

697
01:02:58,614 --> 01:02:59,844
I'm sorry, Mrs. Caswell.

698
01:02:59,884 --> 01:03:02,354
The personal list, I'm sure I'm here.

699
01:03:02,384 --> 01:03:03,754
I'm sorry, Mrs. Caswell,

700
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:06,314
it doesn't appear to be there anymore.

701
01:03:10,054 --> 01:03:11,154
Would you take a bullet?

702
01:03:11,194 --> 01:03:12,754
Madam?

703
01:03:12,794 --> 01:03:14,624
For the president.

704
01:03:14,664 --> 01:03:15,964
Would you take a bullet?

705
01:03:15,994 --> 01:03:17,764
I'm a soldier, madam.

706
01:03:17,804 --> 01:03:22,264
Just following orders? Do your duty?

707
01:03:22,304 --> 01:03:24,174
Yes, madam.

708
01:04:17,564 --> 01:04:19,254
Fuck do you want?

709
01:04:20,634 --> 01:04:22,994
Nothing, my ball.

710
01:04:23,034 --> 01:04:25,664
Got your ball, right?

711
01:04:25,704 --> 01:04:26,694
Yes.

712
01:05:39,344 --> 01:05:44,174
because there was fear in Dallas...

713
01:05:44,214 --> 01:05:46,974
that there might be a demonstration

714
01:05:47,014 --> 01:05:49,044
that will embarass the president,

715
01:05:49,084 --> 01:05:51,714
because it was only on October 24

716
01:05:51,754 --> 01:05:53,614
that our Ambassador to the United Nations

717
01:05:53,654 --> 01:05:56,854
Adlai Stevenson, was assaulted in Dallas

718
01:05:56,894 --> 01:05:58,984
leaving a dinner meeting there.

719
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:05,354
From Dallas, Texas the flash, apparently official:

720
01:06:05,404 --> 01:06:07,394
President Kennedy died

721
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:11,034
at 1:00 p. m. central standard time,

722
01:06:11,074 --> 01:06:15,564
2:00 eastern standard time, some 38 minutes ago.

723
01:06:15,614 --> 01:06:18,804
Killed...

724
01:06:18,844 --> 01:06:21,314
They killed him...

725
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:25,784
Vice President Johnson has left a hospital in Dallas,

726
01:06:25,824 --> 01:06:29,654
we do not know to where he has proceeded.

727
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:33,354
presumably he will be taking the Oval Office shortly

728
01:06:33,394 --> 01:06:38,294
and become the 36th president of the United States.

729
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:46,644
President Kennedy at the Dulles airport this morning

730
01:06:46,674 --> 01:06:50,004
where cheering waving..

731
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:14,254
Stop.

732
01:08:14,294 --> 01:08:16,624
Bugs...

733
01:08:16,664 --> 01:08:19,494
You're gonna hurt them.

734
01:08:22,734 --> 01:08:26,264
November 22, and my garden is blossoming.

735
01:08:31,414 --> 01:08:33,784
Police have been looking for a white man,

736
01:08:33,814 --> 01:08:36,254
approximately 30 years of age

737
01:08:36,284 --> 01:08:39,744
135 pounds, slender built.

738
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:41,414
It seems that this man has shot the president

739
01:08:41,454 --> 01:08:43,614
with 30-30 rifle.

740
01:08:46,494 --> 01:08:49,154
It's not my fault.

741
01:09:30,944 --> 01:09:32,564
Adam.

742
01:09:34,814 --> 01:09:36,534
Don't touch me.

743
01:09:36,574 --> 01:09:38,804
I'm sorry...

744
01:09:38,844 --> 01:09:39,834
Get out.

745
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,504
- Catherine, I...
- No.

746
01:09:41,554 --> 01:09:42,744
Get out, you little shit.

747
01:10:01,804 --> 01:10:03,294
Mom?

748
01:10:07,914 --> 01:10:09,504
It's alright.

749
01:10:09,544 --> 01:10:14,104
Everything's gonna be fine.

750
01:10:43,474 --> 01:10:44,914
How bad was it?

751
01:10:44,944 --> 01:10:48,384
Well when he came around the corner,

752
01:10:48,414 --> 01:10:50,284
wind was blowing, people were talking

753
01:10:50,314 --> 01:10:53,914
laughing, waiting,

754
01:10:53,954 --> 01:10:56,354
Then his head snapped back

755
01:10:56,394 --> 01:10:57,884
then forward

756
01:10:57,924 --> 01:11:01,554
Jackie climbed over the trunk like she's looking for something

757
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:02,894
and the cars drove away.

758
01:11:02,934 --> 01:11:04,954
- God...
- I gotta get back to the office.

759
01:11:05,004 --> 01:11:06,794
But you've just got here 10 minutes ago.

760
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:09,804
Oswald hired a lawyer. I'll be there all night.

761
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:12,104
It must have been horrible.

762
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:13,134
Yeah, it was.

763
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:19,044
At least it's over.

764
01:11:19,084 --> 01:11:21,544
Thank God for small favors.

765
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:25,484
I'll us, see you buddy.

766
01:11:41,434 --> 01:11:43,204
Oh, hello.

767
01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:46,764
I just... I was wondering if I might come in for a moment.

768
01:11:46,804 --> 01:11:50,144
No, I don't think so.

769
01:11:50,174 --> 01:11:53,804
I just wanted to make sure that Adam is alright.

770
01:11:53,844 --> 01:11:55,474
He's fine.

771
01:11:56,884 --> 01:11:59,114
I think he has something of mine.

772
01:11:59,154 --> 01:12:01,284
Well I'll make sure that I ask him.

773
01:12:01,324 --> 01:12:03,224
Okay.

774
01:12:09,394 --> 01:12:10,594
Upstairs.

775
01:12:10,634 --> 01:12:12,624
- I just want...
- Now.

776
01:12:27,984 --> 01:12:30,144
Oh, I have to agree with you.

777
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:32,484
Fuck the glass, go straight for the bottle.

778
01:12:32,524 --> 01:12:34,144
Just leave me alone.

779
01:12:37,694 --> 01:12:39,994
I just wanted to check on you,

780
01:12:40,024 --> 01:12:43,434
make sure you're okay.

781
01:12:43,464 --> 01:12:45,294
Where did you find Ruby?

782
01:12:45,334 --> 01:12:48,494
He a friend of Del Valle's?

783
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:52,664
Friend of yours?

784
01:12:54,174 --> 01:12:56,614
It's a little more complicated than that.

785
01:12:56,644 --> 01:12:58,234
Complicated?

786
01:12:58,284 --> 01:13:00,544
He's the president and he's dead.

787
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:04,284
Was... The president. Was.

788
01:13:05,984 --> 01:13:07,974
When I married you...

789
01:13:10,694 --> 01:13:15,094
you were the most idealistic man I'd ever met.

790
01:13:15,134 --> 01:13:19,394
The man who's gonna change the world.

791
01:13:19,434 --> 01:13:21,994
You've changed the world alright...

792
01:13:22,034 --> 01:13:24,504
You lost every ideal you ever had...

793
01:13:24,544 --> 01:13:25,664
Times are different.

794
01:13:25,704 --> 01:13:27,474
Times are the same

795
01:13:28,574 --> 01:13:30,064
you are different.

796
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:33,744
I didn't lose my ideals, Catherine.

797
01:13:36,514 --> 01:13:37,984
I've lost you.

798
01:13:45,264 --> 01:13:49,254
He wouldn't listen... not to anybody.

799
01:13:54,234 --> 01:13:56,464
I need the diary, Catherine.

800
01:13:59,604 --> 01:14:02,204
Need a little deniability, Graham?

801
01:14:02,244 --> 01:14:05,644
Point A leads to point B

802
01:14:05,684 --> 01:14:08,144
leads to finger on the trigger?

803
01:14:08,184 --> 01:14:12,014
Just leave me alone.

804
01:14:12,054 --> 01:14:13,074
I am a ex...

805
01:14:13,124 --> 01:14:15,144
Ex wife,

806
01:14:16,254 --> 01:14:17,914
Ex mother,

807
01:14:17,964 --> 01:14:20,394
Ex lover.

808
01:14:20,424 --> 01:14:22,764
- If you don't give it to me...
- I'll talk.

809
01:14:22,794 --> 01:14:26,824
I'll break every rule in your little book.

810
01:14:26,864 --> 01:14:31,934
I'll talk about you and Lucian and Del Valle.

811
01:14:31,974 --> 01:14:34,604
Who put your fingers on that trigger?

812
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:36,504
Lee Harvey Oswald was the only man

813
01:14:36,544 --> 01:14:37,734
with his finger on the trigger.

814
01:14:37,784 --> 01:14:41,274
Leave me alone and it will stay that way.

815
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:47,154
Besides, I burned it.

816
01:14:47,184 --> 01:14:49,024
It's not like you.

817
01:14:49,054 --> 01:14:52,654
You got diaries going back to the third grade.

818
01:14:52,694 --> 01:14:54,164
What is like me, Graham?

819
01:14:56,594 --> 01:14:58,154
What am I like?

820
01:15:08,314 --> 01:15:10,544
- Harris was...
- Fuck you.

821
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:20,244
It wasn't your fault...

822
01:15:23,124 --> 01:15:26,114
I... I've lost you.

823
01:15:28,494 --> 01:15:30,484
And I want you back.

824
01:15:32,834 --> 01:15:35,204
We could go away...

825
01:15:37,334 --> 01:15:41,204
start over, just the two of us, anywhere you want.

826
01:15:41,244 --> 01:15:44,474
I think I'd like that.

827
01:15:44,514 --> 01:15:47,384
But you must give Lucian the diary.

828
01:15:47,414 --> 01:15:50,714
I told you I burned it...

829
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:55,414
Talk to him, tell him,

830
01:15:55,454 --> 01:15:57,444
and then we'll go whereever you want.

831
01:16:00,224 --> 01:16:02,354
I'll think about it.

832
01:16:02,394 --> 01:16:04,424
Do...

833
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:16,734
Do that...

834
01:16:48,074 --> 01:16:50,804
I'm leaving.

835
01:16:50,844 --> 01:16:52,674
I fully expect never to see you again

836
01:16:52,714 --> 01:16:54,274
and I hope that the feeling is mutual.

837
01:16:54,314 --> 01:16:55,544
Where are you going?

838
01:16:55,584 --> 01:16:57,384
I'll be gone.

839
01:16:57,414 --> 01:16:59,784
You won't have to worry about me anymore, agreed?

840
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,554
The diary poses a problem.

841
01:17:02,594 --> 01:17:05,214
You can't shut up everyone, Lucian.

842
01:17:05,264 --> 01:17:08,694
I don't have to, just the people who will talk.

843
01:17:11,034 --> 01:17:14,494
The diary is in a safe place.

844
01:17:14,534 --> 01:17:17,564
Leave me alone and it will stay there.

845
01:17:19,904 --> 01:17:21,464
I just love a good mystery.

846
01:17:21,514 --> 01:17:22,974
I mean it, Lucian.

847
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:25,574
I wonder where it could be, that's the question.

848
01:17:25,614 --> 01:17:27,344
No doubt, the safe place.

849
01:17:27,384 --> 01:17:28,874
And who knows...

850
01:17:30,714 --> 01:17:32,444
you might even give it someone.

851
01:17:32,484 --> 01:17:36,854
The safest place, the place I would never think to look.

852
01:17:36,894 --> 01:17:39,554
I wonder where that could be.

853
01:17:39,594 --> 01:17:42,394
Who that could be.

854
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:45,464
You wouldn't...

855
01:17:45,504 --> 01:17:50,234
Catherine, I would do anything I had to anything at all.

856
01:18:03,654 --> 01:18:06,314
And to bring the point home

857
01:18:06,354 --> 01:18:08,484
he stood before that horrible wall

858
01:18:08,524 --> 01:18:16,364
and declared to the world: "Ich bin ein Berliner".

859
01:18:16,394 --> 01:18:17,384
We are all...

860
01:18:17,434 --> 01:18:19,494
Jelly dougnuts.

861
01:18:21,004 --> 01:18:22,404
Excuse me?

862
01:18:22,434 --> 01:18:25,234
"Berliner", he pronounced it wrong.

863
01:18:25,274 --> 01:18:27,794
He said we're all jelly dougnuts.

864
01:18:27,844 --> 01:18:29,814
Is that a joke?

865
01:18:29,844 --> 01:18:31,364
No, sister.

866
01:18:31,414 --> 01:18:32,884
Stand up.

867
01:18:34,114 --> 01:18:36,584
Come here.

868
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:42,414
Hold out your hand.

869
01:18:44,564 --> 01:18:47,084
John F. Kennedy was the greatest president

870
01:18:47,124 --> 01:18:49,254
that this country will ever know.

871
01:18:50,134 --> 01:18:52,104
A Catholic

872
01:18:52,134 --> 01:18:54,434
a man with a vision for the future.

873
01:18:55,504 --> 01:18:58,264
I will not tolerate jokes at his expense.

874
01:18:58,304 --> 01:18:59,464
I wasn't trying...

875
01:18:59,504 --> 01:19:01,874
A great man has been taken from us.

876
01:19:01,914 --> 01:19:05,604
Now go... and you pray.

877
01:19:05,644 --> 01:19:08,634
Pray hard.

878
01:19:26,834 --> 01:19:27,994
Adam.

879
01:19:35,074 --> 01:19:37,344
What are you doing here?

880
01:19:37,374 --> 01:19:39,874
I told them I was your aunt.

881
01:19:49,294 --> 01:19:52,024
I need it back.

882
01:19:52,064 --> 01:19:53,154
What?

883
01:19:53,194 --> 01:19:54,624
What do you think?

884
01:19:57,264 --> 01:19:58,394
I'm sorry I...

885
01:19:58,434 --> 01:20:02,634
Don't be sorry, just give it back.

886
01:20:02,674 --> 01:20:04,794
It's at home.

887
01:20:04,844 --> 01:20:08,364
Bring it to me then. Okay?

888
01:20:08,414 --> 01:20:13,574
After school, meet me at the steps at 3:30. Okay?
- Okay.

889
01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:20,344
I'm going away for a little while.

890
01:20:20,384 --> 01:20:22,354
Where?

891
01:20:22,394 --> 01:20:24,484
I don't know.

892
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:26,494
India, maybe.

893
01:20:26,524 --> 01:20:30,624
Some place exotic and foreign,

894
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:33,964
where I can't understand the language.

895
01:20:34,004 --> 01:20:35,764
Why?

896
01:20:35,804 --> 01:20:38,464
Because I can't...

897
01:20:41,774 --> 01:20:44,214
Life is about meaning.

898
01:20:44,244 --> 01:20:50,274
You know, finding things in life that have meaning.

899
01:20:50,314 --> 01:20:53,774
Children, art...

900
01:20:53,824 --> 01:20:56,184
love.

901
01:20:56,224 --> 01:20:59,524
Well I don't have anything of that anymore.

902
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:01,494
You have me.

903
01:21:01,534 --> 01:21:03,324
I know I do.

904
01:21:03,364 --> 01:21:07,664
But sometimes, one person isn't enough.

905
01:21:07,704 --> 01:21:11,464
You put all your desires and your dreams into them and then...

906
01:21:11,504 --> 01:21:16,064
...they're gone.

907
01:21:18,684 --> 01:21:20,044
If I was older...

908
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,344
Then you wouldn't be you.

909
01:21:24,354 --> 01:21:25,514
Hope...

910
01:21:27,654 --> 01:21:31,424
It's something that gets lost as you get older...

911
01:21:31,464 --> 01:21:36,154
I need to find it again.

912
01:21:37,464 --> 01:21:40,294
Is that some sort of life lesson or something?

913
01:21:43,674 --> 01:21:45,334
Something like that.

914
01:21:54,914 --> 01:21:56,974
3:30, the steps.

915
01:22:24,684 --> 01:22:26,614
Graham, it's me.

916
01:22:26,644 --> 01:22:28,474
I'll have it this afternoon.

917
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:33,584
Graham, I'm happy we're going away.

918
01:23:05,024 --> 01:23:06,314
You're home early.

919
01:23:08,594 --> 01:23:10,614
So are you.

920
01:23:10,654 --> 01:23:12,354
Is everything okay, buddy?

921
01:23:12,394 --> 01:23:14,124
Why was he here?

922
01:23:14,164 --> 01:23:15,954
Who?

923
01:23:15,994 --> 01:23:18,624
The trenchcoat. That guy...

924
01:23:18,664 --> 01:23:22,564
Well he's uh an old friend of your mom's and mine and he uh...

925
01:23:37,854 --> 01:23:39,784
Where is it? What did you do with it?

926
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:42,444
There are some things that don't make sense when you're a kid.

927
01:23:42,494 --> 01:23:43,684
She wants it back.

928
01:23:43,724 --> 01:23:44,744
I'm sure that she does.

929
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:46,024
I said I'll give it back.

930
01:23:46,064 --> 01:23:48,184
When you're older you... you'll understand.

931
01:23:48,234 --> 01:23:51,164
I am older, I do understand.

932
01:23:51,194 --> 01:23:52,424
Adam.

933
01:23:52,464 --> 01:23:54,124
You told me the truth when it suits you.

934
01:23:54,164 --> 01:23:55,864
You lie to me for my own good?

935
01:23:55,904 --> 01:23:58,964
Catherine has never lied to me, not once.

936
01:23:59,004 --> 01:24:00,664
I'm sorry, Adam.

937
01:24:02,474 --> 01:24:04,034
You are my father...

938
01:24:04,074 --> 01:24:08,344
You're supposed to do the right thing... for me.

939
01:24:09,954 --> 01:24:11,284
I did.

940
01:24:12,454 --> 01:24:14,974
Adam...

941
01:24:24,494 --> 01:24:25,964
That's mine.

942
01:24:26,004 --> 01:24:27,464
Actually... it's not.

943
01:24:27,504 --> 01:24:29,494
It's not yours either.

944
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:33,134
You're absolutely right.

945
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:42,304
Adam.

946
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:47,454
Catherine's had a full life.

947
01:24:47,484 --> 01:24:50,784
Art, love, intrigue...

948
01:24:52,224 --> 01:24:54,714
Sometimes, with a life like that

949
01:24:54,764 --> 01:24:58,524
it starts to get confusing.

950
01:24:58,564 --> 01:25:01,504
Catherine was confused.

951
01:25:01,534 --> 01:25:03,764
The diary said that.

952
01:25:07,604 --> 01:25:09,774
Where is she?

953
01:25:13,314 --> 01:25:14,834
Isn't she waiting for you?

954
01:27:08,964 --> 01:27:11,894
Bobby said you were a fag.

955
01:27:11,934 --> 01:27:13,164
Good for him.

956
01:27:13,204 --> 01:27:15,934
He said that you offered to suck his dick for a quarter.

957
01:27:15,974 --> 01:27:18,204
So?

958
01:27:20,504 --> 01:27:22,234
So what are you're gonna do about it?

959
01:27:29,584 --> 01:27:30,744
He said you were gonna suck...

960
01:27:30,784 --> 01:27:31,874
You're the fag!

961
01:27:31,924 --> 01:27:33,784
- Asshole!
- What?

962
01:27:33,824 --> 01:27:34,814
Pussy!
