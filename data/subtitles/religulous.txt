1
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:37,215
This is it.

2
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:38,814
I'm standing on the very spot

3
00:00:38,857 --> 00:00:42,020
where many Christians believe
the world will come to an end.

4
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:43,824
It's called Megiddo.

5
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:46,296
And it's the place that
the Book of Revelation says

6
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:48,458
Jesus Christ
will come down to

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,628
to end the world and save
the people who believe in him.

8
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,161
Now when Revelations
was written,

9
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:57,141
only God had the capacity
to end the world,

10
00:00:57,176 --> 00:01:00,373
but now man does too,
because unfortunately,

11
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:02,744
before man figured out
how to be rational

12
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:05,682
or peaceful, he figured out
nuclear weapons

13
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:08,278
and how to pollute
on a catastrophic scale.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,447
And if it's one thing
I hate more than prophecy,

15
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,980
it's self-fulfilling prophecy.

16
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:18,893
Sometimes in your search
for happiness,

17
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:21,422
you ponder the meaning
of your life.

18
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:24,095
Who am I?
How did I come to be?

19
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:27,003
Death, and then what?

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,302
I certainly honestly believe

21
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:33,607
religion is detrimental

22
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:35,613
to the progress
of humanity.

23
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:38,115
You know, it's just selling
an invisible product.

24
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,209
It's too easy.

25
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:43,278
These questions
about what happens when you die,

26
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:46,883
they so freak people out

27
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:49,587
that they will
just make up any story

28
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:51,391
and cling to it.

29
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,557
You know, things that they know

30
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,397
can't be true,
people who are otherwise

31
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,835
so rational about everything else,

32
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:00,668
and then they believe that

33
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:03,300
on Sunday
they're drinking the blood

34
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:05,537
of a 2,000-year-old God.

35
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:09,013
I can't...
that's a dissonance in my head.

36
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,572
I can't... I have to find out.

37
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:14,017
I just have to find out.
I have to try.

38
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:42,377
This is the Mount of Olives.
This is Jesus's footprints.

39
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:44,177
We're here freezing our ass off.

40
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:52,653
Is there anybody on the stage that

41
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:55,159
- does not believe in evolution?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:58,096 --> 00:03:00,530
Hurry hurry hurry.

43
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:05,499
- I like my hat.
- You look good too.

44
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:08,799
Welcome to Bible Country!

45
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:10,832
"Birthplace of the Virgin Mary"?

46
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:16,476
I believe that God wants
everybody to be free.

47
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:18,483
That's what I believe,

48
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:22,180
and that's one part
of my foreign policy.

49
00:03:24,423 --> 00:03:26,414
Bill, watch out.

50
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:32,260
Boy, do I feel cheap.

51
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,730
I want to thank God
for just blessing me so much.

52
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:41,705
Music has been
a blessing from God.

53
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,765
Thank you, Jesus!

54
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:47,677
You need a Holy Ghost enema
right up your rear end!

55
00:03:57,823 --> 00:04:00,087
The archives are there on the fifth
floor where you see the curtains.

56
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,320
Yeah, put that away now.
Put that away.

57
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:07,058
If you look at my stand-up

58
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,693
from like the '80s... that era...

59
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:12,795
early '90s,

60
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:16,638
I talked about religion,
but I'm not ever questioning God.

61
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:19,075
I'm just making fun
about things

62
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:21,238
in the religion...
circumcision.

63
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,043
Circumcision...
I mean, I would've loved

64
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:26,482
to have been there for
the first people to hear about this.

65
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:28,986
We're used to it now,
but you know, I mean,

66
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:30,886
I'm sure when Moses came
down with this idea,

67
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:33,323
there had to be one guy going,

68
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,553
"Let me get this straight."

69
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,926
It was just
a gentle poking fun at Him.

70
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:39,897
It's almost like
I'm roasting Him.

71
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:42,594
My mother is Jewish and my father
is Catholic. That is the truth.

72
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:44,397
I was raised Catholic formally,

73
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:46,734
although I must say
the Jewish mind comes out

74
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:49,002
even in the Catholic system.
I'll give you an example.

75
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,804
We used to go into confession

76
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:53,436
and I would bring
a lawyer in with me.

77
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,248
You know.

78
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:01,877
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

79
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,081
I think you know Mr. Cohen.

80
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:10,794
So let me get out some pictures.

81
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:12,660
There's me.

82
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,928
We weren't brought up Jewish.

83
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:18,095
I didn't even know
we had that side,

84
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:20,161
so it was very Catholic.

85
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:22,366
We went to church
every Sunday,

86
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:24,671
but I wouldn't take off the gun

87
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,439
and really when I think back,

88
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,810
it wasn't relevant
to my life.

89
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:32,476
Superman was relevant
and baseball.

90
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:35,077
We had this family

91
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,418
where one person
was Jewish

92
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:40,550
and the other three
were Catholic.

93
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:43,561
Now there it says
"A Sunday noon, fall '66,"

94
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:47,190
so we must've
just gotten back from church,

95
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:49,325
'cause I'm in a red suit

96
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:52,303
and you're choking the dog.

97
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:56,034
And I guess we got home from church
and took a picture with you.

98
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:58,065
It never occurred to me to say,

99
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,304
"Why didn't you go to church?"

100
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:00,675
Mom...

101
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:03,340
what church do we belong to?

102
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:05,475
I don't remember
this ever coming up.

103
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:07,485
Of course you didn't go
to church with us.

104
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,147
No, we never had a family
discussion about it, never.

105
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:12,088
We never had
a family discussion about that.

106
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:15,582
Every family is dysfunctional.

107
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:18,926
So you thought even this,
which wasn't your religion,

108
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:21,194
was better than no religion.

109
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:24,600
Well, even this only
told you good things...

110
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,228
I thought.

111
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:29,434
But it's just so shamelessly
invented as they go along.

112
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:33,069
- We can say that now.
- Was anyone...

113
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:35,477
When we quit
the church, I was 13,

114
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:38,915
and I was of course thrilled,
but not for any ideological reason.

115
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,918
I was just thrilled
'cause I hated church.

116
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:42,783
It scared me.
It was boring.

117
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,686
I had to get up
on Sunday.

118
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:46,315
I was 13.

119
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:48,690
I would've worshiped anything
that could've allowed me

120
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:51,560
to masturbate even more
than I was masturbating

121
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:55,396
or get a girl. That god I would have
definitely worshipped.

122
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:57,425
Why do you remember

123
00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:00,302
Dad stopped going to church?

124
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,806
We used birth control,

125
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:06,072
and the church frowned
on birth control.

126
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:08,079
That was the biggest sin

127
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:11,412
- you could ever commit.
- Right, that would...

128
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,045
I think that was possibly...
he never said it to me.

129
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:18,215
And he never went back.
None of us ever did.

130
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:20,747
So now that we don't believe,

131
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:22,419
where did...

132
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:24,292
Nobody said we don't believe.

133
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,126
We don't believe in Catholicism.

134
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:31,764
Right, but what do
we believe in now?

135
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:34,203
Come on.
You're my mother, instruct me.

136
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,598
I don't know
the answer to that.

137
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:39,075
That's my answer.

138
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:42,342
We'll take some back roads to see

139
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,610
- some interesting stuff out here.
- Take some back roads.

140
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,981
We are heading toward Raleigh, right?

141
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:49,452
Oh, yeah, man, can't you feel it?

142
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,176
Do I stand up here?
So as I was going here,

143
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:16,942
I just jotted down
a few questions that came to my mind.

144
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:19,917
Are you ever bothered
by many things

145
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:22,681
that are in Christianity
that are not in the Bible?

146
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:25,383
Like original sin.

147
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,152
Immaculate conception.

148
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:31,128
The virgin birth is only
in two of the Gospels... popes.

149
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:34,189
Are you worried that these things
came not from the founders,

150
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:36,530
the people that wrote
this book, but from...

151
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,695
and this is indisputable...
but from men,

152
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:40,671
from human beings
who came after?

153
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:43,230
And when I say men,
I mean people with penises.

154
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,071
If you wanna go back
to scientific proof,

155
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:49,103
I think it was determined
the shroud or whatever that was

156
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:50,671
went around a while back...
I didn't get involved.

157
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:53,684
- Shroud of Turin?
- They took blood samples from it,

158
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:55,743
and it was female blood
with a male figure.

159
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:58,255
Okay, the only possible way
that could happen was

160
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,350
that the Holy Ghost
impregnated Mary

161
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:03,361
because it would've
been female blood

162
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:05,386
because it would've been
the only blood flowing through her.

163
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:09,958
- It's a faith thing.
- But why is faith good?

164
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:12,492
Why is believing something
without evidence good?

165
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:14,266
I don't like the way
this thing's going.

166
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:16,274
I don't know what
this documentary's supposed to be,

167
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:17,900
but I don't like
where you're going.

168
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:21,174
You start disputing my God,

169
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:24,512
and you got a problem.
I don't know what you...

170
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:27,848
I'm outta here. You do what
you wanna do, but I'm outta here.

171
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:33,213
- I'm just asking questions.
- Okay, no problem.

172
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:36,125
When I've seen what I've seen,
I know there's a God.

173
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:39,062
You can't change my mind.
Nobody can change my mind.

174
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:42,123
I walked for 30 years
as a Satanist priest.

175
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,294
From the time I grew up,
I was in Satanism.

176
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:46,804
For the last six years,
that I was into Satanism,

177
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:48,931
I was a Satanist priest, okay?

178
00:09:48,974 --> 00:09:51,067
- Real Satanism?
- Yes, real Satanism.

179
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:54,078
Being addicted to drugs,
and running prostitutes

180
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,137
and the women
and everything that goes with that.

181
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:58,547
I walked around with rolls
of money in my pocket.

182
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,881
I gave all that up
when I got saved.

183
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,944
When the guy said,
"Yeah, I used to do drugs.

184
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:06,446
I used to have women,"
and I'm thinking,

185
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:09,790
- "And your problem was?"
- Right.

186
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:11,125
Let me ask you this question:

187
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:12,459
What if we're right
and you're wrong?

188
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:14,795
We gonna make it
and you ain't.

189
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,824
If you're being good
just to save your ass

190
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:19,166
just because,
"Ooh, they might be right

191
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,832
and I just want
to double down here

192
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:24,171
and make sure that
when I get up to the pearly gates,

193
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:26,200
that St. Peter doesn't say to me,

194
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:28,178
'Sorry, asshole,
you had the wrong religion.

195
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:30,272
Enjoy Hell, buh-bye."'

196
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:32,283
That's not a good reason,
and you know that.

197
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:34,478
Come on, believe in Jesus.
What do you have to lose?

198
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,510
It's like the lotto.

199
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:39,022
You can't get saved
if you don't play.

200
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:41,753
Yeah, you could be right.
I don't think it's very likely,

201
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:45,092
but, yes, you could be right,
because my big thing is I don't know.

202
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,324
That's what I preach.

203
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:49,356
I preach the gospel
of I don't know!

204
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:51,835
I mean that's what
I'm here promoting... doubt.

205
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,235
- That's my product.
- Right.

206
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:56,206
The other guys are
selling certainty, not me.

207
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,175
I'm on the corner
with doubt.

208
00:10:58,209 --> 00:10:59,767
So, Dr. Collins,

209
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:02,245
you are a brilliant
brilliant scientist,

210
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,840
the head
of the Human Genome Project.

211
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:08,080
Now here's what's
so puzzling is that you are

212
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,848
the one scientist...

213
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:11,617
the one famous scientist anyway...

214
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:14,454
who's also religious.
Explain that to me.

215
00:11:14,492 --> 00:11:16,653
I would argue that
if you look at the evidence,

216
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:20,461
the historical evidence
of Christ's existence is overwhelming.

217
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:22,329
What evidence?

218
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:25,859
I mean, I've never even heard
anyone propose that there's evidence.

219
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:27,633
There's been proof
that there's a Jesus.

220
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:29,970
- That's been proven.
- That hasn't been proven.

221
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:32,806
How you figure that one?

222
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:34,311
When I read the New Testament,

223
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:37,213
it reads to me
as the record of eyewitnesses

224
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:38,579
who put down what they saw.

225
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,675
You know
they weren't eyewitnesses.

226
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,744
- They were close to that.
- No.

227
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:45,517
Within a couple
of decades of eyewitnesses.

228
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:48,492
- Okay.
- Would that stand up in a laboratory

229
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:51,791
as absolute foolproof evidence

230
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,388
that something happened?

231
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:55,865
You are setting up
a standard for proof

232
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,199
that I think would really be
an almost impossible standard to meet.

233
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:02,764
No gospel tells us what he was
doing when he was a young man.

234
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,002
You know,
we see Jesus as an infant

235
00:12:05,043 --> 00:12:08,604
and then we kind of pick up
the story when he's 30.

236
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:10,944
I think Jesus was probably
an awkward teenager...

237
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:14,213
big Jewfro,
bad at sports.

238
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:16,618
Here I am!

239
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:19,248
The records we have
are all gospels.

240
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,417
Gospels are not history.

241
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:24,587
Gospel writers never met Jesus,
neither did St. Paul.

242
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:26,620
No one who wrote
about Jesus ever met him.

243
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,632
How can you go back
into the prophets

244
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,793
and the prophets specifically
specifies that certain things...

245
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:32,359
Well, first of all,

246
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:34,929
the New Testament came after
the Old Testament. We agree to that?

247
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:37,203
I agree to that,
but that doesn't mean anything.

248
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:39,437
All it means is the people that
wrote the New Testament

249
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:42,878
read the Old Testament
and then made the prophesies fit.

250
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:44,472
They can't make it fit
if something didn't happen.

251
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,143
Of course they can.

252
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:48,379
Then you're saying
the Bible is fictitious?

253
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,047
- I am.
- Can't be.

254
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:51,612
I am.

255
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,817
We do all know that
those texts don't match.

256
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,883
Yeah, sure.
Would you expect them to?

257
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:58,987
I'm surprised that things
that are very important to the story

258
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,624
like the virgin birth
isn't in all four of them.

259
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,033
Wouldn't you really expect
that kind of discordance when you're

260
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,833
thinking about the way in which
these documents came into being?

261
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:10,966
But you'd think if you were
one of Christ's biographers,

262
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:14,638
that would be sort
of an important thing not to leave out.

263
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,807
Oh, God,
he was also born of a virgin.

264
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:20,079
They don't notice the virgin birth.

265
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:24,077
You know, I think that is something
if you were any sort of reporter

266
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:25,987
you'd put into the story.

267
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:29,790
What editor looks at the facts and goes,
"Yeah, but take out the thing

268
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:33,525
about the virgin birth.
That's not interesting."

269
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:35,692
I think being without faith

270
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,928
is something that's a luxury

271
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:40,062
for people who were
fortunate enough

272
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:41,935
to have a fortunate life.

273
00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:43,531
You know, you go to prison

274
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:45,805
and you hear a guy say,
"You know what, buddy?

275
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:47,436
I got nothing but Jesus in here."

276
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:49,777
I completely understand that.

277
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:53,045
I think not having faith
is a luxury sometimes.

278
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,985
If you're in a foxhole,
you probably have a lot of faith, right?

279
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,783
- Mm-hmm.
- So I get that.

280
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:00,552
But you guys aren't dumb.
You're smart people.

281
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:02,116
How can smart people...

282
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,628
how can they believe
in the talking snake,

283
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:07,358
people living to 900 years old
and the virgin birth?

284
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:09,525
And you know,
that's my question.

285
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,125
You guys have
your own questions.

286
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:12,693
Pray for me.

287
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:15,467
Father, in the name of Jesus
and by the power of the Holy Spirit,

288
00:14:15,507 --> 00:14:17,702
we ask right now, Lord,
as we lift up Bill to You, Father,

289
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:20,575
that You can answer his questions
that we can't answer.

290
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,580
Father, we thank You
right now for the opportunity

291
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,741
that has come today,

292
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,410
that we may voice
our opinions and hear others.

293
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:29,113
So we ask You, Lord, to touch

294
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:32,122
and feel wisdom right now
in the name of Jesus.

295
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:34,215
And we thank You for it
in Jesus's name, amen.

296
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,422
Thank you for being Christlike,
and not just Christian.

297
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:40,863
Okay. Hey, my wallet!

298
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:43,663
No, I'm kidding.

299
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:47,501
You see so many nice people
trying to make it about

300
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:49,268
something good

301
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:51,832
and yet it turns
into not just corrupt,

302
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:55,073
but, like, fucking-little-kids corrupt

303
00:14:55,113 --> 00:14:57,479
and burning-people-alive cor...

304
00:14:57,515 --> 00:15:00,040
I mean, really evil shit.

305
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:02,882
I'd like to see 10,000 people

306
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:04,411
give $10,000.

307
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,923
Write your biggest check
and send it in.

308
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,756
We got people on welfare that's got
enough faith to make a $1,000 vow

309
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:13,753
- and paying it!
- I want to be in the green, Lord!

310
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,092
What I'm about
to say is revelation.

311
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:21,264
I got it on DVD.
And I have it on DVD.

312
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:23,672
And you need to get this. Hallelujah!

313
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:28,842
Hallelujah!

314
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:34,884
Reverend.
Is that what I call you?

315
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,285
No, just call me... doctor.

316
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:39,415
- Doctor?
- Yeah.

317
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:42,949
All right, Doc. First of all,
I have to tell you, when I heard that

318
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:45,155
you were in Harold Melvin
and the Blue Notes,

319
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:47,391
I was like, "That's my man."

320
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:53,834
And it's funny,
because that lyric

321
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,896
can be interpreted religiously.

322
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,908
"If you don't know me
by now." Right?

323
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:59,671
I mean, you must've thought of that.

324
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:02,009
The song did go platinum.

325
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:05,816
Teddy Pendergrass,
who led the song,

326
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,341
he was ordained a minister
when he was 10 years old.

327
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:10,752
What do you think
it says about religion

328
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:12,722
and how serious it is

329
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:14,918
if you can be a minister
when you're 10?

330
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:21,690
But there is a comparison
to be made between

331
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,928
musical stars, rock stars

332
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:26,300
and religious figures.
They very often both dress

333
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:28,601
- in elaborate costumes...
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,471
...that get people's attention.

335
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:45,813
People in a congregation

336
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:48,189
must know that
the outfit was financed

337
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:51,195
by their donations,
and it doesn't seem to bother them.

338
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:53,288
I always dress well.

339
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,526
I see! Are those gators?

340
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,158
Those are lizards.

341
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:58,862
- Lizards?
- Yes.

342
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:02,168
- What do they run?
- They don't run. They crawl.

343
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,167
And I see you got a lot of bling.

344
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,010
I like gold.
The people want you to look well.

345
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:12,016
That's what pimps say
about their women.

346
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,383
I was told by one of the greatest pimps
that ever lived...

347
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,719
his name is called God...

348
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:19,882
that if you know what you got,

349
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:21,892
then you ain't got much.

350
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:23,826
Jesus dressed very well.

351
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:25,920
Oh, come on.

352
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,261
- Where is the Biblical evidence?
- Wait a minute.

353
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,494
When he was born,
they brought him gold.

354
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:33,003
They brought him gold.
He was not poor.

355
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:35,471
So my image of Jesus as a man

356
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:37,531
who championed the poor
and walked around

357
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:41,011
in simple garb, that's wrong?

358
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:43,172
It was linen.
It was fine linen.

359
00:17:43,214 --> 00:17:44,738
- Really?
- Yeah.

360
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:48,274
But Jesus constantly preaches
against rich people.

361
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,719
The Bible does not speak
against being rich.

362
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:53,451
- Jesus does. Very plainly.
- No no.

363
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:56,619
Jesus was very
very against the rich.

364
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:59,926
He never preached against being poor.
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for...

365
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,761
No, he preached
against being rich.

366
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,427
No no no, he said that
it's better for a rich man...

367
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:07,927
than a rich man to enter...

368
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:11,738
It is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle

369
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:14,244
than for a rich man
to enter the Kingdom.

370
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:17,907
Okay, but now things
like houses and cars

371
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:20,440
and clothes and money,

372
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:22,783
they come as a result

373
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,981
of my seeking God first.

374
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,990
I don't remember that

375
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,616
in the New Testament specifically.

376
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:30,684
But it's there. I remember it.

377
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:32,252
The houses, the cars

378
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:33,285
and the clothes, they'll come.

379
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:36,630
Yeah, money comes,
money happens, you know.

380
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:40,159
Well, money happens for you
because they're giving it up to you.

381
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,468
You're not giving it up to them.

382
00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:43,769
Let me set the record straight.

383
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:45,969
I do not receive
a salary from the church.

384
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,171
I do not take a salary
from the church.

385
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:49,839
- You take it right out of the pot.
- No no no.

386
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:51,644
It's such a powerful position.

387
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:53,912
I mean, you hold people's

388
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:57,512
greatest hopes and dreams
in the palm of your hand, really.

389
00:18:57,555 --> 00:19:00,388
Certainly, some of the young women
must get a crush on you.

390
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:06,453
Probably. I would too
if I was out there.

391
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:09,227
If I was a woman, I'd probably
have a crush on me, too.

392
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,292
That's keepin' it real.

393
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:15,032
Now I can advise other young men
about women, because I've been there.

394
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,768
I had a young man who was
about to go crazy over a woman.

395
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:19,470
He was about
to kill himself, you know?

396
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,638
I said, "That kind of passion,
you should have for God."

397
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,581
I said, "Turn that to God
and see what happens."

398
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:32,645
St. Paul, for example,
whom I know you compare yourself to.

399
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,715
People do.

400
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,557
But he famously
only wore on his back

401
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:39,995
the clothes that he owned.

402
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:41,658
- Should I assume that this is...
- He was always on the run.

403
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:45,362
This is your only $2,000 suit?

404
00:19:45,403 --> 00:19:47,462
The gentleman who made
this suit for me

405
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:49,564
owns a clothing store.

406
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:51,837
Mr. Kane, you in the house?

407
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,640
The prices that I get
my clothes for...

408
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,477
- you know, I'm blessed in that area.
- Yes, you are.

409
00:19:57,515 --> 00:20:01,246
I'm more blessed than
I've ever been all the days of my life.

410
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:04,516
And the owner is a Muslim,
which... I came out of Islam.

411
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:08,286
I know, I think it's very interesting
that you're a Christian now,

412
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:10,794
you were a Muslim
and when you get your clothes,

413
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:14,525
you buy them like a Jew.

414
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:17,056
And action!

415
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:19,968
That's right... behind me and above me
is the original Twin Cities,

416
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:21,164
Sodom and Gomorrah.

417
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:23,469
Apparently, it was
a pretty wicked place.

418
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:25,202
How wicked?

419
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:27,711
Well let's just say that
what happened in Gomorrah,

420
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:29,372
stayed in Gomorrah.

421
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:35,274
That is until God got wind of it,

422
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,947
so he sent two angels
to investigate.

423
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,957
Now the angels went to the house

424
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:42,721
of the one godly man in town... Lot.

425
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,457
And the townspeople tried
to rape them.

426
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:48,658
Now Lot,

427
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:51,566
not wanting his town
to get the reputation

428
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:55,231
as the kind of place
that would rape angels,

429
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:58,902
offered up to the mob
his own daughters to rape.

430
00:20:58,943 --> 00:21:01,468
And he was
the good guy in town.

431
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:03,571
Which brings me
to this question:

432
00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:06,879
If I ever had to swear an oath,

433
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:08,886
why would I want to put my hand

434
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,946
on the King James Bible?

435
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:15,152
I think I could find more morality
in the Rick James Bible.

436
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:20,624
God hates fags.

437
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:24,328
The Constitution does not
grant to homosexuals

438
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:26,063
the right to perform sodomy.

439
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:28,264
- I'm a monk.
- A monk.

440
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:29,967
Franciscan.

441
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:31,975
What do you think
of homosexuality?

442
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:34,341
Do you think that's...
the Bible is against it.

443
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,970
No, the Bible is not against it.

444
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:37,981
The Bible's not
against homosexuality?

445
00:21:38,015 --> 00:21:41,041
If you are born homosexual,
you are to stay there.

446
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:43,679
- You have to be happy.
- But that's what the Bible says?

447
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:46,349
What the Bible means to say, yeah.

448
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,255
Oh, what the Bible means to say!

449
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:50,351
Now that's a good book.

450
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,487
It preaches the rock-solid truth.

451
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,020
You are faggots!

452
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:57,432
I don't hate them.
God hates them.

453
00:21:57,468 --> 00:22:00,301
- Hey, Bill.
- How are you? Nice to meet you.

454
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:03,205
Okay. Okay.

455
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,676
So of course, the reason
why we're here is because you're...

456
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:09,179
I guess we would say, ex-gay.

457
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:11,147
You used to be gay

458
00:22:11,182 --> 00:22:13,980
and then you married someone
who used to be a lesbian.

459
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:17,078
And you have three children,
and I guess the jury's out on them.

460
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:22,683
Okay, and would you say
it's just like any other marriage

461
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:24,888
of 14 years...
you never have sex?

462
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,193
Oh, funny. Ha ha. Got that.

463
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:30,860
I don't classify myself
as ex-gay, you know?

464
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:33,199
I'm a heterosexual guy
who dealt

465
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:36,798
with some homosexuality.

466
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:39,935
Okay, so the people
who come here are people

467
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:41,877
who are wanting to do what you did.

468
00:22:41,912 --> 00:22:45,871
They want to reform their life
and lead a heterosexual life.

469
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:49,010
But I will be honest with you.
The reality's a lot of people come here

470
00:22:49,053 --> 00:22:51,988
and go right back
into whatever they came from.

471
00:22:52,023 --> 00:22:55,049
- Because they're gay!
- I believe that it's sin.

472
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:58,892
Excuse me, but don't you have it,
no pun intended, ass-backwards?

473
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:00,590
Meaning?

474
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:03,327
Meaning homosexuality

475
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:05,835
is something that occurs in nature.

476
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,668
I was out bird watching,
but I'd rather watch you.

477
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:10,264
Why don't you come over
and get some?

478
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,572
Man is who wrote
the Bible.

479
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:15,841
Nature made gay people.

480
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,576
Nobody's born gay.
There's no scientific or...

481
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:21,244
Really? Have you ever met
Little Richard?

482
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:23,879
We can look at creation and say,
"What's the normal order?"

483
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:26,082
A man has a penis.
A woman has a vagina.

484
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:27,750
Let's just be blunt.

485
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:30,090
There's no scientific
data that proves

486
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:32,561
that anyone is...
there's no gay gene.

487
00:23:32,596 --> 00:23:34,393
And you also discovered
the gay gene?

488
00:23:34,432 --> 00:23:36,195
Yes.

489
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:38,531
This is all coming from the Bible
which you believe...

490
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:41,060
- Right.
...to be the word of God.

491
00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:43,335
- I do.
- All of the proscriptions

492
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:46,935
against homosexuality come
from the Old Testament.

493
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:49,411
Jesus never said a word
about homosexuality.

494
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:51,642
And if it's so important,
why didn't he ever bring it up?

495
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:54,515
We could pick lots of little things

496
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:56,520
that he didn't
specifically talk about.

497
00:23:56,554 --> 00:24:00,320
- But this is a big thing.
- Let me stop this whole thing.

498
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:03,292
You know, I'm not sure what
your documentary is about,

499
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:07,286
but if it's to basically refute
the word of God,

500
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:10,232
then I'm not interested
in doing your interview, okay?

501
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:12,667
- Well, l...
- I think that

502
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,762
obviously you don't have
the same relationship

503
00:24:14,805 --> 00:24:16,773
with Jesus Christ that I do.

504
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:20,607
But what is your explanation
for the millions and millions of people

505
00:24:20,644 --> 00:24:22,236
around the world who are

506
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,440
- leading homosexual lives...
- Well, it's not millions.

507
00:24:24,482 --> 00:24:28,441
...have no interest in anyone
of the opposite sex?

508
00:24:28,486 --> 00:24:31,011
Are they all faking
just to piss off Jesus?

509
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:33,455
They didn't choose this.
They didn't desire it.

510
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:34,981
Right, they were born gay.

511
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:36,959
No, they weren't born that way.

512
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:40,157
It's because of the insecurity
within theirselves.

513
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:43,758
It takes a lot of security to walk out
of the house with assless chaps.

514
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:47,202
- They're not happy, most of them.
- They're called gay.

515
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:48,796
They took the word.

516
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,966
Some of them look positively thrilled.

517
00:24:56,647 --> 00:24:59,207
No, they are people who
are really not complete

518
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,842
in who they are
as men or women.

519
00:25:00,885 --> 00:25:03,820
That's a pretty big judgment
for a Christian.

520
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:05,822
- It's not a judgment.
- That's not a judgment?

521
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,154
That you are sitting here
telling these people

522
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:10,752
who you don't even know
that they're incomplete

523
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:12,284
because they're not like you?

524
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:14,957
I mean, it's not the people you suspect

525
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:16,557
that are gay, that are gay.

526
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,194
People like
the Reverend Ted Haggard...

527
00:25:19,236 --> 00:25:21,534
Moral purity is better than immorality.

528
00:25:21,572 --> 00:25:25,030
...who kept meeting
homosexual prostitutes in a hotel room

529
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:28,636
and having gay sex with speed.

530
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:31,477
Evangelicals have the best
sex life of any other group.

531
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,377
- Good Morning, Duane!
- But he wasn't gay?

532
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:37,319
I already answered that.

533
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:39,481
I don't believe that
anybody is gay.

534
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:42,287
I don't know,
but honestly, if I just saw you

535
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:45,989
in a bar or something, I would say...
and don't take this the wrong way...

536
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,260
I would say, "Yeah,
I think that guy is gay."

537
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,496
You're good looking.
You're neat, you know.

538
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:54,197
- You don't look like me.
- Meaning?

539
00:25:54,238 --> 00:25:55,933
Meaning...

540
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,596
- All right, thank you.
- Can I give you a hug?

541
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:21,893
- Yes!
- I hug everybody,

542
00:26:21,932 --> 00:26:23,126
so can I give you a hug?

543
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:26,703
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.

544
00:26:26,737 --> 00:26:28,705
Hey, you didn't have
a hard-on there, did you?

545
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:31,674
Nope, sorry. Can't do that.

546
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,978
That was good, though.

547
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:39,380
When I was 17,
my first girlfriend dumped me,

548
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:42,749
and I was sad in a way
I'd never been sad.

549
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:45,619
You know,
your first dumping is the worst.

550
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:47,920
And at that point,
you're very vulnerable

551
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:51,018
to any sort of connection

552
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:52,892
with, you know...

553
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,490
I didn't get like Jesus-religious,

554
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,966
but I did think a force out there

555
00:26:58,002 --> 00:27:01,267
was communicating to me
through song lyrics or...

556
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:04,672
numerology I was
very interested in for a while.

557
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:08,576
You said you were groping
for something at that time.

558
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:11,046
You know, you make up
an imaginary friend who loves you,

559
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:13,447
is sympathetic to you
and has a plan for you.

560
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:16,851
It's much more important.
He didn't have to love me, God,

561
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,855
He just had
to be working for me.

562
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,413
You know, He's like an agent.

563
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:23,153
So you are an ex-Jew for Jesus.

564
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:24,660
That is correct.

565
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:28,597
Now what made you to decide
to be a follower of Christ?

566
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:30,930
What brought Christ
into your life?

567
00:27:30,968 --> 00:27:34,199
Back in '75,

568
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:36,263
I went to Michigan
State University.

569
00:27:36,307 --> 00:27:39,708
- $2,700?
- Yeah, it's pricey.

570
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,439
Boy, I wonder what Madonna
without the child runs you.

571
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:45,141
So getting back to my story,
I could ask God

572
00:27:45,182 --> 00:27:48,049
to do things in the name
of Jesus and they would happen.

573
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:51,452
So I can't even recall
all the little miracles He did,

574
00:27:51,488 --> 00:27:54,889
but He proved to me that
He was real and He was there.

575
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,655
They were so miraculous
and you can't remember what they were?

576
00:27:57,695 --> 00:27:59,322
There were so many of them
and they were little things.

577
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:02,161
- Give me an example.
- One example I can remember was

578
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:03,461
I was at a party.

579
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,162
There was a guy who was working
with Jews for Jesus,

580
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:09,502
and I asked him,
"Can I get a drink of water?"

581
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,407
And he says,
"You know what? Here's a glass,

582
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:14,343
stick your hand out the window
and pray for rain."

583
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:17,203
I didn't like the attitude.

584
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:18,771
I said okay,

585
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,944
and I stuck my hand out the window
and it started pouring rain.

586
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:25,716
Pouring so bad that people
couldn't leave the party.

587
00:28:25,756 --> 00:28:27,986
To me, that's a miracle.
You don't have to believe it,

588
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:31,153
- but I know between me and God...
- It is pretty lame.

589
00:28:31,195 --> 00:28:33,959
- But you asked.
- I asked, but I'm just saying

590
00:28:33,997 --> 00:28:36,932
- that's my reaction to your answer.
- But that's just one of many things.

591
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,026
I live a life of miracles.

592
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:42,937
No, you live your life with the same
sort of mundane coincidences

593
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,804
that happen to everybody
in the world.

594
00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:48,642
It's not like,
you know, if it rained frogs,

595
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,306
I would say you had a point.

596
00:28:50,347 --> 00:28:52,315
But it rains, and it stops raining.

597
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:54,510
Well, when was the last time
you asked for rain

598
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:56,143
and it starting raining
within 10 seconds?

599
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:57,983
I don't know.
I don't ever ask for rain.

600
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:00,285
But if I asked for it really bad
and it started to rain,

601
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:01,814
I wouldn't think it was
because I asked for it.

602
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:04,259
I would think
because it sometimes rains.

603
00:29:04,294 --> 00:29:06,785
God is not that busy

604
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,889
where He can't spend time
listening to you

605
00:29:08,932 --> 00:29:10,763
when you really want
to talk to Him, anytime.

606
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:13,361
If Santa Claus can hit
every house in the world

607
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:15,531
- in one night...
- I don't believe in Santa Claus.

608
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:18,507
Of course not, that's ridiculous.
That's one man flying

609
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:21,102
all around the world and dropping
presents down a chimney.

610
00:29:21,145 --> 00:29:23,909
That's ridiculous.
One man hearing everybody murmur

611
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:26,313
to him at the same time, that I get.

612
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:30,417
And you know what else
was very confusing to me?

613
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:32,445
I remember vividly

614
00:29:32,489 --> 00:29:35,390
was Santa Claus

615
00:29:35,426 --> 00:29:38,293
- and Jesus.
- You were so mad at us.

616
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:41,320
- Oh, yes.
- So mad at you, why? Oh, when...

617
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:44,425
When you realized there
was no Santa Claus.

618
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:47,198
And then when I found out
there was no Jesus,

619
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:49,728
boy, was I pissed.

620
00:29:49,773 --> 00:29:52,333
You spoke before in certitude.

621
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,401
You're 100% sure
that after you die,

622
00:29:54,445 --> 00:29:56,675
you'll go to a better place.

623
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,580
I know I'll be with God.
I'll be with Jesus.

624
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:01,345
And that's a better place.

625
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:03,979
Even if it was in a garbage can,

626
00:30:04,021 --> 00:30:05,989
which I know it won't be,
but even if it was,

627
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:08,787
just the fact that
I'm with Jesus, to me, is good.

628
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:10,919
- It's a better place.
- It's a better place.

629
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:14,419
Then why don't you kill yourself?

630
00:30:14,465 --> 00:30:16,228
Because God still has
a mission for me here.

631
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:17,460
Oh, I see.

632
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:21,028
I'm thinking of Jonah.
God sent Jonah on a mission.

633
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,938
When did the part of the story come
when Jonah lived in the whale?

634
00:30:23,974 --> 00:30:25,965
It was a great fish.

635
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:27,977
It's one of my favorite
nonsense stories,

636
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:30,172
Jonah living inside
of the whale.

637
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:34,014
And their answer unfailingly is

638
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:37,350
"The Bible doesn't say whale.
It says big fish."

639
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:39,378
Oh, yeah, big fish,
that makes...

640
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:42,824
I'm sorry I was obsessing
on that it was a whale. It's a big fish.

641
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,555
Of course you could live
for three days in a big fish.

642
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:46,460
A tuna.

643
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:49,591
They do it all the time in Japan.
They have tuna spas.

644
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:52,864
You go for three days.
They pamper you, oils.

645
00:30:52,903 --> 00:30:56,236
You come out of that tuna
feeling fantastic.

646
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:57,831
You smell like pussy,

647
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:01,140
but you feel fantastic.

648
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:04,011
This man lived inside
of a fish for three days?

649
00:31:04,047 --> 00:31:06,948
Miraculously, yes.

650
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:09,509
Steve, Steve, Steve.

651
00:31:09,553 --> 00:31:11,282
You don't believe in miracles.

652
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:13,983
- That doesn't mean they don't exist.
- Of course not!

653
00:31:14,024 --> 00:31:15,582
I'm not 10!

654
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:17,560
He lived in a fish.

655
00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:20,256
Come on.

656
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:23,528
Your bar on miracles is pretty low,
I gotta tell you, bro.

657
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,592
Well, whatever.

658
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:28,127
Two things that are
completely incompatible

659
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:31,402
are Christianity
as Jesus taught it

660
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:33,375
- and nationalism...
- Right. Exactly.

661
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,675
...and yet people always
say God and country.

662
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:39,341
Jesus would never...
you know,

663
00:31:39,383 --> 00:31:41,214
people who are
such good Christians...

664
00:31:41,251 --> 00:31:44,015
in one breath you'll hear them
say something like,

665
00:31:44,054 --> 00:31:45,954
"Well, you gotta take care
of your own first.

666
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,719
I know people overseas have trouble,
but you gotta take"...

667
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:52,627
that is not a message I can ever see
the Jesus in the Bible,

668
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:55,632
even when he was
in a bad mood, would say.

669
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:00,929
I'm gonna vote Bible.

670
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:02,529
It's time for God's people to come

671
00:32:02,573 --> 00:32:05,736
out of the closets,
out of the churches

672
00:32:05,776 --> 00:32:07,607
and change America!

673
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:09,236
Unless you and I do
what God wants us to do,

674
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,440
he'll go to some other country.

675
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:13,813
God, forgive America!

676
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,786
I would probably have to say yes,
that the Constitution established

677
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:20,585
the United States of America
as a Christian nation.

678
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:23,218
We have, of course,
"In God We Trust" on our money.

679
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,420
The Senate will come to order.

680
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:25,655
The chaplain will lead
the Senate in prayer.

681
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:34,600
How did this country
get to be a Christian nation?

682
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:37,106
I've read a lot of quotes
from all the Founding Fathers.

683
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,869
There are a lot of quotes
that explicitly say

684
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:41,104
we're not a Christian nation.

685
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:55,355
And Jefferson's
a particularly interesting case.

686
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:59,055
Didn't he write his own Bible
which divorced the New Testament

687
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:02,327
from what he considered
the unnecessary magic,

688
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:04,095
bells and whistles?

689
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:06,193
He took the Gospels,

690
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:08,261
took out all of Jesus's miracles

691
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:10,102
and took out
all of Jesus's statements

692
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,370
that claimed divinity,

693
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,707
and put out a new book called
"The Faith and Moral Teachings

694
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,178
of Jesus of Nazareth."

695
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:19,307
We tend to lionize these guys
and think of them all

696
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:22,580
as the 12 Apostles
plus the Founding Fathers,

697
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:24,883
like they're in the same
club or something.

698
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,549
When in fact,
these men understood very well

699
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,821
that there was a difference
between being Christian

700
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,725
and being American.

701
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:33,992
- Right.
- In Jefferson's age, fewer people went

702
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:36,864
to church less often.

703
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,232
Do you think that there
are a lot of people

704
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:42,238
who feel the way you do,
but are afraid to speak out?

705
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,035
Absolutely. Are you kidding?

706
00:33:44,074 --> 00:33:47,475
Yes, I think it is
the great untapped minority

707
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:49,206
in this country.

708
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:50,770
In the last survey,

709
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:54,341
I think it was 16% of Americans

710
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:57,410
who now say they are
absolutely unaffiliated

711
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:00,048
with any religion,
don't want to be in a religion,

712
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,853
just don't go near me
with religion.

713
00:34:01,892 --> 00:34:04,827
16% of the population is

714
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:07,853
a huge minority.
It's bigger than Jews,

715
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:11,800
blacks, homosexuals,
NRA members,

716
00:34:11,835 --> 00:34:14,326
lots of people you could name
who have lobbies

717
00:34:14,371 --> 00:34:16,896
that get everything they want

718
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,842
or are at least are in the debate.

719
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:23,004
You want me to kinda angle
like this or straight ahead?

720
00:34:23,046 --> 00:34:25,241
Just as natural as possible to Bill.

721
00:34:25,282 --> 00:34:28,513
So you've described yourself
as an Evangelical Christian.

722
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:32,010
You did a campaign ad where you said
the most important lessons in life

723
00:34:32,055 --> 00:34:34,956
are in this book right here,
meaning the Bible.

724
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:38,722
Everyone in politics likes
to brag that they're a person of faith.

725
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:41,390
Why is faith good?

726
00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:43,422
Faith has a way

727
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:45,765
of softening people.

728
00:34:45,802 --> 00:34:49,067
For example, if you look at the
teachings of Jesus, he's very forgiving.

729
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:51,165
He also said,
"If a man doesn't abide in me,

730
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:54,075
he is cast forth
as a branch and withers,

731
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:57,672
and the branches are gathered,
thrown into the fire and burned."

732
00:34:57,714 --> 00:35:01,081
Right. So?

733
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:02,949
I do think, 'cause I'm a Christian,

734
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:05,750
that Jesus is the way
to be reconciled.

735
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:10,419
And I do believe
the actual literacy of that story.

736
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,920
We'll let God sort out all the details
of that on Judgment Day.

737
00:35:14,965 --> 00:35:16,694
What about
the 10 Commandments?

738
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:20,066
So many politicians talk
about the 10 Commandments.

739
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:22,298
Are they really the 10 most

740
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:24,739
- important moral...
- Are these the 10 suggestions?

741
00:35:24,775 --> 00:35:27,266
The 10 recommendations?

742
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,676
But it's not really a wide list of 10.

743
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,681
The first four are all

744
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:35,014
about just worshipping God
and basically that he's a jealous God,

745
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,178
and he doesn't want you
to have any other gods.

746
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,313
The only two that are really laws

747
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:41,347
are don't steal and don't kill.

748
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,621
Why is this the wisest group of 10?

749
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,357
It doesn't include child abuse.
It doesn't include don't torture.

750
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,490
It doesn't include
a lot of things... rape...

751
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:52,331
that I think if we were
making a list today,

752
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:54,030
we would probably include.

753
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,470
Society is so different today

754
00:35:56,506 --> 00:35:58,997
and our culture is
so radically different today.

755
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:01,602
That's what I'm asking.
We're in a different culture.

756
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:05,274
Can you think of anything else that
we still cleave to from the Bronze Age?

757
00:36:05,315 --> 00:36:07,146
Well...

758
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:28,899
Basically, murder is against the law
in every country in the world.

759
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:31,931
But wouldn't we have come
to that even without religion?

760
00:36:31,975 --> 00:36:34,671
Don't you think people would
have gotten together and said,

761
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:36,804
"You know what?
Let's not slaughter each other

762
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:40,544
- and not take each other's stuff."
- I don't know.

763
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:43,382
There's been more killing
in the name of "My God."

764
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,856
You think maybe sort of indigously

765
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,085
or just by our DNA,

766
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,923
we somehow know that killing
another person is wrong?

767
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,590
I'm not sure that that's the case.

768
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,327
Really, you need God
to decide not to kill each other?

769
00:36:57,367 --> 00:37:00,768
Well, you can look back
at more primitive cultures,

770
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:04,433
and they were constantly at war.

771
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:12,070
We are now, among industrialized,
modern nations,

772
00:37:12,115 --> 00:37:14,345
the most religious nation.

773
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:16,443
A recent study found that

774
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:18,545
among 32 countries,

775
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:21,182
more people in this country
doubted evolution

776
00:37:21,224 --> 00:37:24,955
than any other country on that list,
except, I think, it was Turkey.

777
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:27,361
In the US,
we have freedom of religion.

778
00:37:27,397 --> 00:37:29,695
I think most of the countries on
that list do have freedom of religion.

779
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:31,633
Well, that's interesting.

780
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:32,930
Do you believe in evolution?

781
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:35,870
You know my... I don't know.

782
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:38,636
Clearly the scientific community's
a little divided

783
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:42,042
on some of the specifics
of that and I understand that.

784
00:37:42,078 --> 00:37:44,911
- I don't think they are.
- No no... well...

785
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:46,973
I think they pretty much agree.

786
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,848
I don't know how it all happened.

787
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:51,911
I'm certainly willing to accept
the scientific premise.

788
00:37:51,955 --> 00:37:54,617
It couldn't possibly
have been Adam and Eve

789
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:57,786
5,000 years ago with a talking snake
and a garden, could it?

790
00:37:57,827 --> 00:37:59,488
Well, it could've
possibly been that.

791
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:02,089
Come on.
See, this is my problem.

792
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:04,464
I mean, you're a senator.

793
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:06,799
You are one
of the very few people

794
00:38:06,836 --> 00:38:08,599
who are really
running this country.

795
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:12,597
It worries me that people are
running my country who think...

796
00:38:12,642 --> 00:38:14,269
who believe
in a talking snake.

797
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:17,007
You don't have to pass an IQ test
to be in the Senate, though.

798
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,488
As you first come
into the Creation Museum,

799
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:30,993
there's going to be a sense

800
00:38:31,027 --> 00:38:32,756
of "This is something really big."

801
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:35,890
This is something awe-inspiring,
something great here.

802
00:38:35,932 --> 00:38:38,400
We can answer the questions
of the skeptics

803
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:40,164
that attack
the Bible's history.

804
00:38:40,203 --> 00:38:42,865
We admit that we start
from the Bible here

805
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:44,430
to teach them how to think.

806
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:46,635
Really, in a nutshell,
we're saying, the Bible's true

807
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:48,371
from Genesis to Revelation.

808
00:38:53,383 --> 00:38:55,749
We're building the whole place
for about $27 million.

809
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:00,313
I have many people say to me,

810
00:39:00,357 --> 00:39:02,257
"As a Christian,
can't you believe in evolution?"

811
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:04,852
I say, "Well, you got a problem.
God made a man and a woman."

812
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:07,658
If you believe in evolution, the woman
had to come from an ape woman.

813
00:39:07,697 --> 00:39:11,690
All right,
but you're so damned ugly.

814
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:16,835
This is what we call the main hall
here. Immediately, people see

815
00:39:16,873 --> 00:39:18,670
dinosaurs and people together,
which is very different

816
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:22,337
to the idea of the evolutionists
who say dinosaurs died out

817
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:25,644
70 million ago or so,
and so they didn't live with humans.

818
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:28,674
They see an animatronic
dinosaur over here.

819
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:31,346
Two animatronic baby T-Rexes
and two animatronic children.

820
00:39:31,388 --> 00:39:34,824
It's basically just to give people
a wow factor as they come in here.

821
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:42,863
How to share your faith
effectively and Biblically,

822
00:39:42,899 --> 00:39:44,457
to be able to reason
with people,

823
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:46,230
learn to circumnavigate

824
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:48,260
or go around
the person's intellect.

825
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:51,865
There's plenty of people who
would say, "Well, it's just my faith."

826
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:54,604
But that's not good enough
for you. You say, "No.

827
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:57,112
We can basically
reconcile the science

828
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:59,843
with what's in Genesis."

829
00:39:59,883 --> 00:40:02,750
We're an organization that...
to put it in a nutshell...

830
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:05,414
is telling people that
the Bible's history is true,

831
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:06,752
its history beginning
in Genesis.

832
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,191
Scientists line up
overwhelmingly

833
00:40:10,226 --> 00:40:12,421
on one side of this issue.
It would have to be

834
00:40:12,462 --> 00:40:16,228
an enormous conspiracy
going on between scientists

835
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:18,894
of all different disciplines
in all different countries

836
00:40:18,935 --> 00:40:21,563
to have such a consensus.

837
00:40:21,604 --> 00:40:23,128
That doesn't move you?

838
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,664
No, not at all, because from
a Biblical perspective,

839
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:28,939
I understand why the majority
would not agree with the truth.

840
00:40:28,978 --> 00:40:32,072
Man is a sinner.
Man is rebelling against his creator.

841
00:40:32,115 --> 00:40:34,982
All these scientists
are sinners?

842
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:37,077
Well...

843
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,248
We have been talking
to so many religious people

844
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,724
and many of them believe
the earth is 5,000 years old.

845
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:45,227
If you're a scientist,
you can't accept that.

846
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:48,594
Now you recently were the director
of the Vatican Observatory.

847
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:50,792
A Vatican astronomer.

848
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:53,769
It's one of those terms
like "gay Republican"...

849
00:40:53,803 --> 00:40:55,771
you know,
you just don't expect it.

850
00:40:55,805 --> 00:40:59,297
- I'm not getting into that.
- No no no, I'm not asking you to.

851
00:40:59,342 --> 00:41:01,333
It's not that the church
has the idea, you know,

852
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:04,642
they're gonna train us up
so we can be the first ones out there

853
00:41:04,681 --> 00:41:06,808
to baptize those extraterrestrials

854
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,943
before the Mormons get at 'em.

855
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:11,579
The reason is simply

856
00:41:11,621 --> 00:41:14,249
historical facts.

857
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,487
John Paul II,
for instance, said evolution

858
00:41:17,527 --> 00:41:21,486
in the neo-Darwinian sense is
no longer a mere hypothesis.

859
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:23,829
I mean, he said that.
It's in writing.

860
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:26,358
I still don't understand
why it's important

861
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,962
for there to have to have been
a situation on earth

862
00:41:29,005 --> 00:41:31,667
where a man co-existed
with dinosaurs.

863
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:33,266
Only really
in "The Flintstones"...

864
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:35,277
Is someone talking about me?

865
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:36,835
...and that Raquel Welch movie

866
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,372
does man ever co-exist
with dinosaurs.

867
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:44,318
Why is that important
for your salvation or your morality?

868
00:41:44,354 --> 00:41:46,083
If you're saying
this part over here,

869
00:41:46,122 --> 00:41:48,886
it says God made land animals
and man on the same day is not true,

870
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:52,019
then ultimately, why should
I believe this bit over here?

871
00:41:52,061 --> 00:41:55,792
The Christian Scriptures
were written

872
00:41:55,832 --> 00:41:58,630
between about 2,000 years
before Christ

873
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:00,727
to about 200 years after Christ.

874
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:01,964
That's it.

875
00:42:02,005 --> 00:42:05,463
Modern science came
to be with Galileo

876
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:07,874
up through Newton,
up through Einstein.

877
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:11,074
What we know
as modern science, okay,

878
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,581
is in that period.

879
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:15,948
How in the world could
there be any science

880
00:42:15,985 --> 00:42:17,714
in scripture?

881
00:42:17,754 --> 00:42:19,346
There cannot be.

882
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:22,017
Just the two historical
periods are separated

883
00:42:22,058 --> 00:42:23,753
by so much.

884
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:25,727
The Scriptures are not

885
00:42:25,762 --> 00:42:27,923
teaching science.

886
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:29,932
It's very hard for me to accept,

887
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:33,493
not just a literal interpretation
of scripture,

888
00:42:33,536 --> 00:42:36,334
but a fundamentalist approach
to religious belief.

889
00:42:36,372 --> 00:42:38,237
It's kind of a plague.

890
00:42:38,274 --> 00:42:41,004
It presents itself
as science and it's not.

891
00:42:41,044 --> 00:42:43,342
God is an infinite God
who is working in ways

892
00:42:43,379 --> 00:42:46,007
- we don't always understand.
- You don't think that's a cop-out?

893
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:48,711
He is God.

894
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:50,275
Are you God?

895
00:42:51,888 --> 00:42:53,583
No.

896
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:58,923
We went to church every Sunday.

897
00:42:58,962 --> 00:43:02,591
My sister and I went to Catechism,
which is Catholic, you know,

898
00:43:02,632 --> 00:43:06,033
like Hebrew school for papists.

899
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:07,536
It was like war.

900
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,698
It was vast stretches
of boredom punctuated

901
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,436
by moments of sheer terror.

902
00:43:19,082 --> 00:43:21,073
I'm in the Vatican.

903
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:28,687
Buongiorno!

904
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:31,626
I know what you're thinking.
I'm standing in front of a green screen

905
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:33,561
at a studio
in Burbank, California,

906
00:43:33,596 --> 00:43:36,087
and they digitalized
the Vatican in behind me.

907
00:43:36,132 --> 00:43:38,794
No no, that's really the Vatican.

908
00:43:38,835 --> 00:43:40,803
I ought to know.
I just got thrown out of it.

909
00:43:40,837 --> 00:43:42,702
See, I wanted
to interview the Pope,

910
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:46,641
but I was willing to settle
for a cardinal or a monsignor

911
00:43:46,676 --> 00:43:48,803
or the Flying Nun...
really anybody...

912
00:43:48,845 --> 00:43:52,303
but apparently I've been on the
Catholic shit list for quite a while.

913
00:43:52,348 --> 00:43:55,340
But that's their loss, 'cause now
I'm gonna say what I really think,

914
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:57,444
which is mainly:

915
00:43:57,487 --> 00:43:59,079
Does that look anything

916
00:43:59,122 --> 00:44:01,920
like anything Jesus Christ
had in mind?

917
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:05,291
When you look at a building
like that, a giant palace,

918
00:44:05,328 --> 00:44:07,523
does it seem at odds
with the message of the founder?

919
00:44:07,563 --> 00:44:09,087
Well, certainly.

920
00:44:09,132 --> 00:44:12,533
- Well, thank you.
- I mean, that's obvious.

921
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:16,095
It really is obvious, isn't it?
But does it bother you?

922
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:19,506
Well, I mean...
well, yes it does.

923
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:22,102
I wouldn't...
if I were the boss,

924
00:44:22,145 --> 00:44:24,045
I wouldn't be living there.

925
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,072
I mean Jesus would be
probably out in some barracks here

926
00:44:27,116 --> 00:44:30,313
in a suburb of Rome, got it?

927
00:44:30,353 --> 00:44:33,186
Do you ever get so fed up
you want to take the collar and go...

928
00:44:33,222 --> 00:44:35,213
- Well, I don't wear a collar anyway.
..."That's it, Captain.

929
00:44:35,258 --> 00:44:37,283
Take my badge and my collar."

930
00:44:37,327 --> 00:44:40,524
I read about 10 books recently...
the rationality of religion,

931
00:44:40,563 --> 00:44:43,123
and everyone's saying it's stupid.

932
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,368
You know what's
gonna happen to them.

933
00:44:46,402 --> 00:44:48,063
- No, what's gonna happen?
- They're gonna be roasting in hell.

934
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:50,732
Come on, roasting.
That's the old Catholic thing.

935
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:52,240
That's what they taught me.

936
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:54,038
Yeah, I know, that hell business.

937
00:44:54,077 --> 00:44:56,875
Well, come on, the standard doctrine
that I was taught as a kid...

938
00:44:56,913 --> 00:44:59,074
Yeah, that's all gone.
That's all finished.

939
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:00,582
But that's not fair.

940
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:03,915
- Yeah, pfft!
- The date of Jesus's birth

941
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:06,421
really wasn't established
until 349 A.D.

942
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:08,651
Oh, yeah...

943
00:45:08,691 --> 00:45:11,353
because he might've
been born on July 3rd.

944
00:45:11,394 --> 00:45:14,921
These are all
nice stories, you know.

945
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:17,296
- And that doesn't bother you, either?
- That bothers me too.

946
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,665
I mean, when everybody's,
"Ooh, we have to have midnight mass

947
00:45:19,702 --> 00:45:22,500
because Jesus was born
on midnight on 25th of"...

948
00:45:22,538 --> 00:45:24,438
this is all nonsense.

949
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,567
- You're a maverick, aren't you?
- I'm not a maverick.

950
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:30,204
You're Father Maverick.
You do things your own way.

951
00:45:35,618 --> 00:45:38,610
When you add up
all the saints and all the angels

952
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:41,248
and archangels
and super-duper angels...

953
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:44,282
there's God, the Father,
God the Son, the Holy Ghost,

954
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:47,057
Mother Mary...
it does start to look like

955
00:45:47,096 --> 00:45:49,826
it's not quite
the monotheistic religion that it's...

956
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:52,266
Oh, I understand.
Like we have mini-gods.

957
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:55,737
Yeah, well, it does seem like that,
if people pray to a...

958
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:57,899
Well, yeah, but some people
just don't understand this.

959
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,465
You probably are...
you don't follow things...

960
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,104
but they had a survey here
in Italy, you know,

961
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:05,114
and they said, "In a crisis,

962
00:46:05,148 --> 00:46:07,776
what kind of saints
do you pray to?" Got it?

963
00:46:07,817 --> 00:46:10,911
You know who's the sixth
on the list? Jesus Christ.

964
00:46:10,953 --> 00:46:12,648
The sixth?

965
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:16,180
He's the sixth man
that the Italians call upon

966
00:46:16,225 --> 00:46:18,659
when they have problems.
Isn't that neat?

967
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:23,063
- That's very interesting.
- Talk about Cafeteria Catholics. Pfft!

968
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:25,090
So how do you convince people
of what's the true faith?

969
00:46:25,134 --> 00:46:28,069
You don't, forget it.
You just have to live and die

970
00:46:28,104 --> 00:46:31,005
with their stupid ideas.

971
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,270
I'm sorry.
What are you gonna do?

972
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:35,277
You can go to a pitch meeting
at a movie studio and go,

973
00:46:35,311 --> 00:46:37,711
"Okay, there's a spaceman

974
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:39,442
who zaps a virgin

975
00:46:39,482 --> 00:46:42,349
and he gives birth
to a son who's also him,

976
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:44,285
who then goes
on a suicide mission."

977
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,753
I wonder what people
would say about that.

978
00:46:45,788 --> 00:46:47,949
Yeah, that is actually
a great pitch.

979
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,254
It has so many elements
that they like,

980
00:46:50,293 --> 00:46:52,261
because they love
suicide missions.

981
00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:55,093
They love violence,
and Hollywood loves something

982
00:46:55,131 --> 00:46:57,964
it's never seen before... a virgin.

983
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:16,317
Hey, Shalom.

984
00:47:22,325 --> 00:47:25,351
We're so glad to have you here.
Just come and get blessed.

985
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,498
These are here to teach God's word.

986
00:47:33,536 --> 00:47:35,333
We're in a spiritual warfare.

987
00:47:35,371 --> 00:47:37,362
We don't push our beliefs on people,

988
00:47:37,406 --> 00:47:39,465
but we do make them available.

989
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:42,376
- Have you ever had a Muslim person?
- Yes, definitely.

990
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:44,242
People from Gaza Strip come.

991
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:49,543
We get many people
who come here say,

992
00:47:49,585 --> 00:47:51,815
"We've come every year
to Florida

993
00:47:51,854 --> 00:47:55,085
and we've done the tourist
things and all and we enjoy those.

994
00:47:55,124 --> 00:47:58,355
We wish we had
seen this first,"

995
00:47:58,394 --> 00:48:01,659
because their experience
here was so meaningful.

996
00:48:01,697 --> 00:48:04,689
Do you think if...
when you were a kid...

997
00:48:04,734 --> 00:48:07,999
they transposed the Bible stories

998
00:48:08,037 --> 00:48:10,528
with the fairy tales, you'd know
the difference as an adult?

999
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:14,469
- My name is Eve.
- I'm Adam.

1000
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:16,444
This place is amazing.

1001
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:19,243
If they told you Jack
and the Beanstalk was religion

1002
00:48:19,282 --> 00:48:22,376
and that a man who lived
in a whale was in a fairy-tale book...

1003
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,912
you think when you got
to be an adult,

1004
00:48:25,955 --> 00:48:27,946
you'd be defending
the one instead of the other?

1005
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,083
So you're saying that
the Bible's a fairy tale?

1006
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:33,027
God took my rib like this

1007
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:34,996
and began to whittle it

1008
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:36,896
like this

1009
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:40,369
and blow on it...
and then...

1010
00:48:40,403 --> 00:48:43,167
Saved means believing
in Jesus Christ

1011
00:48:43,205 --> 00:48:44,968
- as the only begotten Son of God.
- Not for me, it don't.

1012
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:46,907
What about the Muslims?

1013
00:48:46,943 --> 00:48:49,241
Many Muslims are
saved right now.

1014
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:50,711
I don't get it.

1015
00:48:50,746 --> 00:48:53,146
I pray in your lifetime you do.

1016
00:48:53,182 --> 00:48:56,811
Jesus came through a Jew.
He was not the seed of man.

1017
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:58,820
He came through
a Jewish woman,

1018
00:48:58,854 --> 00:49:00,446
but no man had
ever touched her.

1019
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:02,514
No flesh had ever
touched her.

1020
00:49:02,558 --> 00:49:04,856
He was the seed of God.

1021
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:25,371
You want me to lean up against
the tomb or something

1022
00:49:25,414 --> 00:49:28,440
or you want casual or... okay.

1023
00:49:28,484 --> 00:49:30,076
Did I give you my cell phone?

1024
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,417
Oh, I left my cell phone, right?
Just want to make sure.

1025
00:49:32,455 --> 00:49:34,355
Testing one two,
check, testing.

1026
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:37,257
How you doing, Bill?
God bless you.

1027
00:49:37,293 --> 00:49:38,521
- Hi.
- Seen you around.

1028
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:40,961
- Welcome to our world.
- I've seen you around.

1029
00:49:40,997 --> 00:49:44,194
Now is this your tomb?
Is this a real rock?

1030
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:46,861
No, it's just cement.
They just kind of cemented it in there.

1031
00:49:46,902 --> 00:49:49,632
So when you go out to dinner,
people recognize you?

1032
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:50,969
All the time, yeah.

1033
00:49:51,007 --> 00:49:53,567
I think you get
a little bit of that, too.

1034
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:57,136
But they don't think I'm the Lord.
You must really be...

1035
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:00,148
Why do you think people come here?
'Cause Disneyland's too smutty?

1036
00:50:00,182 --> 00:50:01,911
I personally haven't been
to the Holy Land,

1037
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:03,885
so this was an awesome experience
for me when I walked on the property.

1038
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:07,286
- I was like, "Wow, this is cool."
- Let me ask you questions

1039
00:50:07,323 --> 00:50:08,722
- about your business...
- Yes.

1040
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:12,194
...or really the Jesus business.
God is super powerful.

1041
00:50:12,228 --> 00:50:13,889
- He can do anything.
- Sure.

1042
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:17,092
Why doesn't
he just obliterate the devil

1043
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:20,398
and therefore get rid
of evil in the world?

1044
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:23,166
- He will.
- He will? What's he waiting for?

1045
00:50:23,205 --> 00:50:25,173
- End times.
- But why play it out like that?

1046
00:50:25,207 --> 00:50:27,641
- Why make it a game?
- Well, it's not necessarily a game.

1047
00:50:27,677 --> 00:50:30,805
A day is like a thousand years
in God's eyes, it says in the Bible.

1048
00:50:30,846 --> 00:50:33,212
If you wanna look at it...
just like two days ago, Christ died.

1049
00:50:33,249 --> 00:50:36,776
But I know that he is
so far beyond any of our ways,

1050
00:50:36,819 --> 00:50:39,310
that he can work
the worst situation for his good.

1051
00:50:39,355 --> 00:50:41,346
What was the Holocaust?
Why was that good?

1052
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,858
You know, God had a plan for that.
Maybe it's to cause...

1053
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:45,690
I wonder if you would have thought
that if you were one of the people

1054
00:50:45,728 --> 00:50:47,821
- being pushed into an oven.
- Well, you know what?

1055
00:50:47,863 --> 00:50:50,195
It's like trying to explain
to an ant how a TV works.

1056
00:50:50,232 --> 00:50:52,757
That's... God's ways are
so much higher than ours.

1057
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:55,532
There's no way
you can understand that.

1058
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:57,368
We need to stop the interview
for just a moment, please.

1059
00:50:57,406 --> 00:50:59,237
- Nice to see you.
- Senior manager of public relations.

1060
00:50:59,275 --> 00:51:02,438
- Hi, Les, I'll be right with you.
- Hi. Sure.

1061
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:12,883
I'm not afraid
of the piranha women.

1062
00:51:12,922 --> 00:51:15,550
When he came, he said, "I come not
to abolish the law, but to fulfill it."

1063
00:51:15,591 --> 00:51:18,116
You boil all those
Levitical laws down to two things:

1064
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,684
No other God is before me, Bill,

1065
00:51:19,729 --> 00:51:21,594
and love the Lord with all your heart.

1066
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,393
But, Jesus, having
no other gods before you,

1067
00:51:23,432 --> 00:51:26,128
that's not moral.
There's nothing moral about that.

1068
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:28,830
It's just something
a jealous god would do.

1069
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:30,862
It does say that our God
is a jealous god.

1070
00:51:30,906 --> 00:51:34,603
But your God is jealous?
That seems so unGodlike

1071
00:51:34,643 --> 00:51:36,907
that God would have such
a petty human emotion.

1072
00:51:36,946 --> 00:51:39,414
I know people who have
gotten over jealousy,

1073
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:41,507
- let alone God.
- There's two sides to the coin.

1074
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,280
He's a just God
and he's also a merciful God.

1075
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,279
No, he spends the first five books
of the Bible wiping out people.

1076
00:51:48,324 --> 00:51:51,555
That's what he chose to do.
His ways are higher than ours, Bill.

1077
00:51:51,594 --> 00:51:54,222
- Maybe our thinking should be higher.
- That's a good point.

1078
00:51:54,263 --> 00:51:57,232
God has got
this God-sized hole in your life.

1079
00:51:57,266 --> 00:51:59,097
You can fit that
with any position...

1080
00:51:59,135 --> 00:52:01,729
drugs, sex, whatever you want...
it is not gonna fill it.

1081
00:52:01,771 --> 00:52:03,295
- Can I try?
- You can try all you want.

1082
00:52:03,339 --> 00:52:04,465
You're gonna end up
hurting yourself,

1083
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:06,270
damaging yourself
and burning yourself up.

1084
00:52:06,308 --> 00:52:08,503
I thought Christ was
about not judging people.

1085
00:52:08,544 --> 00:52:10,774
- That's true.
- Isn't that a judgment there?

1086
00:52:10,813 --> 00:52:13,338
You don't know me and you're telling me
I need to fill a hole in my heart

1087
00:52:13,382 --> 00:52:15,407
- with drugs and sex.
- No, I'm not talking about you.

1088
00:52:15,451 --> 00:52:16,975
I'm saying anyone in general.

1089
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:20,284
See, if I was God, I would create people
without the hole to begin with.

1090
00:52:20,322 --> 00:52:24,019
Have you ever had a little voice in
the back of your mind say something?

1091
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,856
- We've all had that.
- That's called the Holy Spirit.

1092
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:28,329
- That's not God. That's you.
- That's called the Holy Spirit.

1093
00:52:28,364 --> 00:52:29,661
- Feel this wind right now?
- Yeah.

1094
00:52:29,698 --> 00:52:31,666
Okay, where is it?
You don't know, right?

1095
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,328
- Yeah, it's called wind.
- Okay, that's like the Holy Spirit.

1096
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,362
It's a monotheistic religion,
but there's three of them.

1097
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:39,840
Just like water can be ice,
steam and water.

1098
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:41,672
I see.

1099
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,871
It's different forms, different shapes
for the different purposes.

1100
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:46,074
The analogy that Jesus
at the amusement park

1101
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:47,980
said yesterday was brilliant,

1102
00:52:48,017 --> 00:52:50,679
about the Trinity is like water.

1103
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:52,914
It can be steam. It can be ice.

1104
00:52:52,955 --> 00:52:55,788
It can be liquid.
Wow, that is...

1105
00:52:55,825 --> 00:52:58,760
boy, that stopped me
in my tracks for a second, you know?

1106
00:52:58,794 --> 00:53:00,694
That's just a brilliant analogy.

1107
00:53:00,729 --> 00:53:02,196
When you think about it
for two minutes,

1108
00:53:02,231 --> 00:53:04,722
it's still complete bullshit.

1109
00:53:04,767 --> 00:53:06,826
There this space God
and he's himself

1110
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:09,133
and he sent himself
on a suicide mission.

1111
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:12,197
He's a God, but he has a kid.
He's a single parent.

1112
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:16,177
It's just silly, but when you put it
in the water analogy,

1113
00:53:16,212 --> 00:53:18,442
I can see that, you know,
those ladies there,

1114
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,607
when they heard that the first time,
they were like, done.

1115
00:53:20,649 --> 00:53:24,380
Sold. Oh, you had me
at ice cube.

1116
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,048
Moving on.
Does it ever bother you

1117
00:53:27,089 --> 00:53:30,581
that the story of a man

1118
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:34,027
who was born of a virgin
was resurrected?

1119
00:53:34,063 --> 00:53:37,260
Your bio was something that was
going around the Mediterranean

1120
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:38,994
for at least 1,000 years.

1121
00:53:39,034 --> 00:53:41,696
We've got Krishna who was in India

1122
00:53:41,737 --> 00:53:44,331
1,000 years before Christ.
Krishna was a carpenter,

1123
00:53:44,373 --> 00:53:47,069
born of a virgin, baptized in a river.

1124
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:49,077
Are you saying that
was written in history?

1125
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:50,874
That was written down in history,
is that what you're saying?

1126
00:53:50,913 --> 00:53:54,576
Absolutely, there's the Persian god
Mithra, 600 years before Christ.

1127
00:53:54,617 --> 00:53:57,245
Born December 25th,
performed miracles,

1128
00:53:57,286 --> 00:53:59,186
resurrected on the third day,

1129
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:02,679
known as the Lamb, the Way, the Truth,
the Light, the Savior, Messiah.

1130
00:54:02,725 --> 00:54:04,852
Stop! Blasphemer!

1131
00:54:04,894 --> 00:54:07,158
All I know is that
I don't go by that hearsay.

1132
00:54:07,196 --> 00:54:10,393
I go by the word of God.
I know that's why I believe.

1133
00:54:10,432 --> 00:54:13,333
- Well, I believe it because it's truth.
- Believe it, yes.

1134
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:15,860
But there's a difference
between truth and what you believe.

1135
00:54:15,905 --> 00:54:19,170
In the Bible it tells us that all things
are possible with God, okay?

1136
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:21,438
Study the religions
of the Mediterranean region

1137
00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:23,035
for a thousand years before.

1138
00:54:23,078 --> 00:54:26,946
Many of the gods were born
on December 25th.

1139
00:54:26,982 --> 00:54:29,644
- No, it's not.
- It's not a new one.

1140
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:31,710
It's funny you should bring
that up because of course

1141
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:33,415
in "Star Wars: Episode l...
The Phantom Menace,"

1142
00:54:33,455 --> 00:54:35,116
Anakin is born to a virgin.

1143
00:54:35,157 --> 00:54:36,488
People see that
and say, "Wait a second.

1144
00:54:36,525 --> 00:54:38,755
Where have we heard that before?"
That's not original.

1145
00:54:38,794 --> 00:54:41,558
- But the Jesus story wasn't original.
- How so?

1146
00:55:31,914 --> 00:55:34,508
Let me ask you a question.
Let's say, if you take the side

1147
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:37,815
- that this is all made up...
- I do.

1148
00:55:37,853 --> 00:55:39,184
...what if you're wrong?

1149
00:55:40,622 --> 00:55:42,351
What if you're wrong?

1150
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:56,769
# Down the Via Dolorosa #

1151
00:55:56,805 --> 00:56:00,332
# In Jerusalem that day #

1152
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:02,640
# The soldiers tried #

1153
00:56:02,678 --> 00:56:06,205
# To clear
the narrow street #

1154
00:56:07,683 --> 00:56:11,551
# But the crowd
pressed in to see #

1155
00:56:11,587 --> 00:56:13,817
# The man condemned to die #

1156
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:16,916
# On Calvary #

1157
00:56:18,694 --> 00:56:21,857
# Down the Via Dolorosa #

1158
00:56:21,897 --> 00:56:25,594
# Called the Way of Suffering #

1159
00:56:25,634 --> 00:56:28,865
# Like a lamb came the Messiah #

1160
00:56:28,904 --> 00:56:31,168
# Christ the King #

1161
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:35,844
# And he chose to walk that road #

1162
00:56:35,878 --> 00:56:38,938
# Out of his love #

1163
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:41,211
# For you #

1164
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,583
# And me. #

1165
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,870
Was Jesus a sinner?

1166
00:57:06,909 --> 00:57:10,538
One master. One word.
I am your master.

1167
00:57:13,282 --> 00:57:16,308
Who do we put away
in the asylums?

1168
00:57:23,926 --> 00:57:25,951
Xenu brought us here

1169
00:57:25,994 --> 00:57:27,962
75 million years ago,

1170
00:57:27,996 --> 00:57:30,692
stacked us around volcanoes

1171
00:57:30,732 --> 00:57:32,996
and blew them up with an H-bomb.

1172
00:57:36,371 --> 00:57:38,362
We are older than the universe.

1173
00:57:42,344 --> 00:57:44,608
You have to rid yourself

1174
00:57:44,646 --> 00:57:46,273
of the implants

1175
00:57:46,315 --> 00:57:49,409
from the extraterrestrial dictators!

1176
00:57:53,055 --> 00:57:56,684
- Get an E-Meter. Yes, get an E-Meter!
- An E-meter?

1177
00:58:00,329 --> 00:58:01,796
Audit yourself.

1178
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:08,227
How do you people expect
to get to the next level?

1179
00:58:10,873 --> 00:58:12,898
I'm not making the rules.

1180
00:58:14,676 --> 00:58:16,667
Aw...

1181
00:58:18,714 --> 00:58:21,114
You know, Scientologists...

1182
00:58:24,153 --> 00:58:28,055
And right, you're like,
"Oh, yeah, that's some crazy shit. Okay.

1183
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:31,025
Jesus with the virgin birth
and the dove and the snake

1184
00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:34,460
who talked in the garden,
that's cool.

1185
00:58:34,496 --> 00:58:37,659
But the Scientologists,
they're the crazy ones."

1186
00:58:37,699 --> 00:58:38,859
That's not true.

1187
00:58:38,901 --> 00:58:41,062
That... that...
I don't have any idea

1188
00:58:41,103 --> 00:58:43,333
of what
you're talking about.

1189
00:58:43,372 --> 00:58:45,397
But it has something to do
with making sure

1190
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,635
that we're born with a defect,

1191
00:58:47,676 --> 00:58:49,473
so that the souls of ours

1192
00:58:49,511 --> 00:58:51,877
are infected with aliens...

1193
00:58:51,914 --> 00:58:54,382
Thank you.

1194
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:58,375
...because the cure?
Scientology.

1195
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,856
They're all crazy.
Yes, the religions do get even crazier.

1196
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,381
They have to to keep up.

1197
00:59:04,426 --> 00:59:06,860
They keep raising the bar.
After you've done the virgin birth,

1198
00:59:06,895 --> 00:59:09,056
you know,
where do you go?

1199
00:59:26,048 --> 00:59:27,743
We're not getting the top?

1200
00:59:27,783 --> 00:59:29,512
- We got the top.
- Oh, okay.

1201
00:59:29,551 --> 00:59:31,610
That's the Mormon Temple
behind me.

1202
00:59:31,653 --> 00:59:34,349
To be a Mormon is to believe
some really crazy stuff,

1203
00:59:34,389 --> 00:59:37,847
crazy even by the standards
of the big religions.

1204
00:59:37,893 --> 00:59:39,383
When you're the new kid
on the block...

1205
00:59:40,996 --> 00:59:44,193
Thank you.
That was helpful.

1206
00:59:44,233 --> 00:59:45,757
You're the new kid
on the block

1207
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:47,564
and all the good crazy has
already been picked over,

1208
00:59:47,603 --> 00:59:50,094
so you kind of have to up the ante.

1209
00:59:50,138 --> 00:59:51,571
Oh.

1210
00:59:51,607 --> 00:59:53,472
God damn it.

1211
00:59:53,508 --> 00:59:55,999
Not while
I'm in the middle of it.

1212
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,448
Well, we do have it.

1213
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:01,574
Boy, a lot of people came

1214
01:00:01,617 --> 01:00:03,346
- out of the woodwork.
- Yeah.

1215
01:00:08,924 --> 01:00:11,119
So did you guys get anybody
from the church to talk to?

1216
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:13,821
Well, if you count getting
thrown off the property

1217
01:00:13,862 --> 01:00:17,320
- "talked to."
- That's probably better.

1218
01:00:17,366 --> 01:00:20,631
We'd like you
to "Meet the Mormons."

1219
01:00:20,669 --> 01:00:23,035
In the founding scripture,
you open up the Doctrine of Covenants,

1220
01:00:23,071 --> 01:00:25,198
you read the autobiography
of Joseph Smith.

1221
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,403
He quotes Jesus Christ as telling him

1222
01:00:28,443 --> 01:00:30,673
that every other creed
on earth is, quote,

1223
01:00:30,712 --> 01:00:32,839
"an abomination."
An abomination.

1224
01:00:32,881 --> 01:00:35,315
I mean, that's not
a very ecumenical statement.

1225
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:38,342
You're talking about things that,
I think, at some level

1226
01:00:38,387 --> 01:00:41,015
you sense just
do not make sense.

1227
01:00:41,056 --> 01:00:44,219
I'm glad you said that because I read
some of the tenets of Mormonism,

1228
01:00:44,259 --> 01:00:47,422
like "God lives on a planet
near the star of Kalob."

1229
01:00:47,462 --> 01:00:49,191
- Kolob.
- Kolob.

1230
01:00:49,231 --> 01:00:52,166
God the Father who's a physical man
with a body of flesh and bone

1231
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,761
is probably about 6' tall,
lives on a place called Kolob,

1232
01:00:55,804 --> 01:00:59,137
had sexual relations with Mary...
remember he's a man.

1233
01:00:59,174 --> 01:01:01,699
"Jesus Christ was conceived
by God the father

1234
01:01:01,743 --> 01:01:03,768
having actual sex with Mary."

1235
01:01:03,812 --> 01:01:06,178
Mary said, "If this is what God wants,

1236
01:01:06,214 --> 01:01:08,045
I'll be glad to do His will."

1237
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:10,051
"Dark skin is a curse from God,

1238
01:01:10,085 --> 01:01:11,677
but if you're sufficiently righteous,

1239
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,880
a dark-skinned person

1240
01:01:12,921 --> 01:01:15,185
can become light-skinned."

1241
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:17,657
According to
the Book of Mormon,

1242
01:01:17,693 --> 01:01:20,161
after his resurrection,
Jesus came to the Americas

1243
01:01:20,195 --> 01:01:22,129
to preach to the Indians.

1244
01:01:22,164 --> 01:01:25,224
"That American Indians are
actually a lost tribe of Israel."

1245
01:01:25,267 --> 01:01:26,461
They're lost Jews.

1246
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:30,094
And also the idea

1247
01:01:30,138 --> 01:01:32,629
that Christianity
is American,

1248
01:01:32,674 --> 01:01:35,165
I think, is an amazing
entitlement to a people

1249
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:38,976
who are always trying
to meld God and country.

1250
01:01:39,014 --> 01:01:42,347
The Garden of Eden was
in Missouri according to Mormonism.

1251
01:01:42,384 --> 01:01:44,249
The new Jerusalem
will be there.

1252
01:01:44,286 --> 01:01:46,186
Branson, I'm hoping.

1253
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:49,156
I've also heard that the Mormon Church
baptizes dead people.

1254
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:51,489
You can be baptized
for about 50 people,

1255
01:01:51,526 --> 01:01:53,551
100 people that've died.

1256
01:01:53,595 --> 01:01:56,325
And so you just get dunked
about 50 to 100 times.

1257
01:01:56,365 --> 01:01:57,923
That's baptism for the dead.

1258
01:01:57,966 --> 01:02:00,901
Caffeine is evil.
That magic underwear can protect you.

1259
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:11,941
And that you need
a secret password to get into heaven.

1260
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,278
Everyone must stand
at the final judgment

1261
01:02:14,316 --> 01:02:17,251
before Joseph Smith,
Jesus and Elohim.

1262
01:02:17,285 --> 01:02:18,752
This isn't an easy religion.

1263
01:02:18,787 --> 01:02:21,756
Why do you think it is that
so few people

1264
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:23,883
do what you have done
and leave the church?

1265
01:02:23,925 --> 01:02:26,155
The moment you acknowledge
to yourself that Joseph Smith

1266
01:02:26,194 --> 01:02:30,153
did not tell the truth about
his experiences and his achievements,

1267
01:02:30,198 --> 01:02:33,031
you just committed
social suicide.

1268
01:02:33,068 --> 01:02:34,899
- Family and friends...
- Family and friends.

1269
01:02:34,936 --> 01:02:37,131
...will... you're off the deep end.

1270
01:02:37,172 --> 01:02:40,471
Dr. Andrew Newberg,
nice to meet you.

1271
01:02:40,509 --> 01:02:44,741
I've finally met someone
who's studied... neurotheology.

1272
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,975
This is getting very close
to something I always say,

1273
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:50,382
which is that religion is
a neurological disorder.

1274
01:02:50,419 --> 01:02:53,286
What does the brain look like
when it's hopped up on God?

1275
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:55,482
We see a lot of different colors,
which help us to...

1276
01:02:55,524 --> 01:02:57,287
tell us what
the activity is in the brain

1277
01:02:57,325 --> 01:03:00,226
and what we have found is that
there are some very specific changes

1278
01:03:00,262 --> 01:03:02,753
when people are actually
meditating or praying

1279
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:05,232
or even speaking in tongues,
which was our last study.

1280
01:03:05,267 --> 01:03:07,735
In the name of Jesus,

1281
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:10,397
you've been made whole
by the power of God.

1282
01:03:10,439 --> 01:03:12,600
- Speaking in tongues?
- We studied people speaking in tongues.

1283
01:03:12,641 --> 01:03:14,768
They're just babbling,
though, right?

1284
01:03:18,013 --> 01:03:20,072
They're not really speaking
in a language they don't know.

1285
01:03:20,115 --> 01:03:23,084
It's not an actual language,
but what's...

1286
01:03:23,118 --> 01:03:24,745
Just bullshit, Doc,
come on.

1287
01:03:24,786 --> 01:03:26,617
Isn't that something?

1288
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:41,934
I love you.

1289
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:45,303
So you would agree that
even if a billion people

1290
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,808
believe something,
it can still be ridiculous?

1291
01:03:47,843 --> 01:03:50,175
- Absolutely.
- But the Jews, I mean, they're...

1292
01:03:50,212 --> 01:03:52,976
excuse me, Jewish friends...
but they're as cuckoo as anybody,

1293
01:03:53,014 --> 01:03:54,982
especially the really Orthodox ones.

1294
01:03:55,016 --> 01:03:58,577
You are one of the
few Jewish people in the world

1295
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,611
who does not believe
in the state of Israel.

1296
01:04:00,655 --> 01:04:02,088
You do not think the state

1297
01:04:02,123 --> 01:04:05,388
- of Israel should exist.
- Correct.

1298
01:04:05,427 --> 01:04:07,520
- Okay.
- God gave us the land of Israel.

1299
01:04:07,562 --> 01:04:11,658
On Mount Sinai where we made
this bond with God,

1300
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,260
He said, "I'm giving you the land,
but I'm stipulating...

1301
01:04:14,302 --> 01:04:17,703
very clearly stipulating... you must
be on a certain level of holiness."

1302
01:04:17,739 --> 01:04:19,468
You will see it clearly
that we were sent out of the land.

1303
01:04:19,508 --> 01:04:21,635
So basically you're saying that

1304
01:04:21,676 --> 01:04:23,837
the Jewish people have
not been holy enough

1305
01:04:23,879 --> 01:04:25,847
to deserve
the land of Israel.

1306
01:04:25,881 --> 01:04:27,746
God understands what is good for us,
what is bad for us...

1307
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:29,977
- First of all...
...what will bring us safety or not.

1308
01:04:30,018 --> 01:04:31,007
Let me just finish.

1309
01:04:31,052 --> 01:04:33,179
God told us, though,
if you will go against God...

1310
01:04:33,221 --> 01:04:35,519
- God manipulates the world...
- Okay, l...

1311
01:04:35,557 --> 01:04:37,354
Wait a second.
Let me finish this.

1312
01:04:37,392 --> 01:04:39,417
God said if you're going
to try to make the state,

1313
01:04:39,461 --> 01:04:41,520
you will be unsuccessful.

1314
01:04:41,563 --> 01:04:43,121
You are looking through...

1315
01:04:43,164 --> 01:04:46,099
you're trying to look
at this world through a keyhole.

1316
01:04:46,134 --> 01:04:48,261
I'm looking through the key...

1317
01:04:48,303 --> 01:04:50,601
Let me finish.
God is compassionate.

1318
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:52,607
Everything is directly
from God, we believe.

1319
01:04:52,641 --> 01:04:55,576
- But it seems to me...
- I'll now explain what you're asking.

1320
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:57,771
The concept of saying

1321
01:04:57,812 --> 01:05:00,372
that we've suffered
enough anti-Semitism...

1322
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,076
Never again.

1323
01:05:02,117 --> 01:05:05,280
So you don't say "Never again."
You say "Again."

1324
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,289
Yeah. Let us understand
that the Jewish people

1325
01:05:08,323 --> 01:05:10,018
were living in exile
for 2,000 years

1326
01:05:10,058 --> 01:05:11,855
under God's protection

1327
01:05:11,893 --> 01:05:13,861
and we were living
in Western civilization...

1328
01:05:13,895 --> 01:05:15,988
- Germany, Poland. Not anymore...
- Let me finish.

1329
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,965
We were living amongst
all nations throughout the years.

1330
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:20,126
...'cause they're all dead.
How many people died in the Holocaust?

1331
01:05:20,168 --> 01:05:23,569
You're jumping.
Let's jump to the Holocaust.

1332
01:05:23,605 --> 01:05:26,233
I thought the issue
was Jewish safety.

1333
01:05:26,274 --> 01:05:28,401
I thought the issue was
how many Jews are dying.

1334
01:05:28,443 --> 01:05:30,468
So let's talk
about Jewish safety.

1335
01:05:30,512 --> 01:05:32,503
Okay, I'm sure there was a few...

1336
01:05:32,547 --> 01:05:36,210
A couple million Jews died,
that's okay, that's the wording you use?

1337
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:39,687
You're the one who went
to Iran in December 2006

1338
01:05:39,721 --> 01:05:41,416
for the president

1339
01:05:41,456 --> 01:05:44,755
of that country's
Holocaust "denial" conference.

1340
01:05:44,793 --> 01:05:46,624
Whoa, don't just throw words.

1341
01:05:57,806 --> 01:06:00,969
Why does Ahmadinejad say
that he wants Israel

1342
01:06:01,009 --> 01:06:02,533
- to be wiped from the face of the...
- When did he say that?

1343
01:06:02,577 --> 01:06:04,511
- He did.
- He never said that.

1344
01:06:04,546 --> 01:06:06,104
What did he say?
What was the exact quote?

1345
01:06:06,147 --> 01:06:10,345
- He said it should disappear.
- What, is he David Copperfield?

1346
01:06:10,385 --> 01:06:13,616
- That's chutzpah.
- Never again, Rabbi, never again.

1347
01:06:13,655 --> 01:06:15,520
Wait. One more second.

1348
01:06:15,557 --> 01:06:17,821
No, I'm out.

1349
01:06:19,861 --> 01:06:21,761
We have Conservatives.
We have Reforms.

1350
01:06:21,796 --> 01:06:23,058
We have the Orthodox.

1351
01:06:23,098 --> 01:06:25,692
You are an observing Jew.

1352
01:06:25,734 --> 01:06:27,599
It says it right there
in the fourth commandment:

1353
01:06:27,636 --> 01:06:30,127
Honor the Sabbath day
to keep it holy.

1354
01:06:30,171 --> 01:06:33,140
Friday night to Saturday night,
you don't do anything.

1355
01:06:33,174 --> 01:06:37,201
Yeah, the rabbis over the centuries
have created these prohibitions

1356
01:06:37,245 --> 01:06:39,679
as a way to try
to protect the day of rest.

1357
01:06:39,714 --> 01:06:43,514
You can't use electricity.
You can't drive.

1358
01:06:43,551 --> 01:06:47,146
Let's talk a little about
keeping the Sabbath holy.

1359
01:06:47,188 --> 01:06:49,713
I've always wondered
if it came about

1360
01:06:49,758 --> 01:06:52,818
because God rested
on the Sabbath

1361
01:06:52,861 --> 01:06:54,829
and that's why man has to.

1362
01:06:54,863 --> 01:06:56,831
That's right,
and that was the creation

1363
01:06:56,865 --> 01:06:58,730
of the seventh day,
that there should be rest.

1364
01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:02,203
There are 39 types of specific actions

1365
01:07:02,237 --> 01:07:04,728
that cannot be done on the Sabbath.

1366
01:07:04,773 --> 01:07:06,365
One of them is lighting a fire.

1367
01:07:06,408 --> 01:07:08,137
Planting. Another one is plowing.

1368
01:07:08,176 --> 01:07:09,973
Another one is
tying a knot, untying a knot.

1369
01:07:10,011 --> 01:07:12,980
One is building, and one is
destroying so as to build.

1370
01:07:13,014 --> 01:07:16,142
So much more kosher is
to develop these gadgets

1371
01:07:16,184 --> 01:07:18,584
- that figure out a way around it.
- That's right.

1372
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:21,316
It does seem that you are,
to a degree,

1373
01:07:21,356 --> 01:07:23,415
trying to outsmart God.

1374
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:26,757
If the lawmaker never
makes a mistake,

1375
01:07:26,795 --> 01:07:30,663
and still there's a loophole there,
why is that loophole there?

1376
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:33,065
To be used in a situation of need.

1377
01:07:33,101 --> 01:07:35,501
But how did this get updated

1378
01:07:35,537 --> 01:07:37,164
for a 4,000-year-old rule?

1379
01:07:37,205 --> 01:07:39,070
It seems there's an awful lot

1380
01:07:39,107 --> 01:07:40,768
that has to do with electricity.

1381
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:42,868
Rabbi Halperin's work here
is translating it

1382
01:07:42,911 --> 01:07:44,879
into something more modern.

1383
01:07:47,716 --> 01:07:49,684
Let's look at some
of the gadgets you have.

1384
01:07:49,718 --> 01:07:53,245
I'm particularly interested in
the phone. Is there not a cell phone?

1385
01:07:53,288 --> 01:07:55,051
It's not a cell phone.

1386
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:56,682
Okay, wow.

1387
01:07:56,725 --> 01:07:59,421
I have to say,
that looks modern.

1388
01:08:00,662 --> 01:08:04,223
Each number is trying
to dial itself all the time.

1389
01:08:06,234 --> 01:08:09,101
Hello. Hello.

1390
01:08:09,137 --> 01:08:10,798
When I take the stick

1391
01:08:10,839 --> 01:08:13,535
- and I put it into the hole...
- Hello.

1392
01:08:13,575 --> 01:08:15,668
...l'm inhibiting that
which is inhibiting

1393
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:18,577
the number from dialing itself.

1394
01:08:18,613 --> 01:08:21,582
Let me ask about this.
It's obviously a wheelchair.

1395
01:08:21,616 --> 01:08:23,743
- May I?
- Sure.

1396
01:08:25,687 --> 01:08:28,622
Oh, wow.

1397
01:08:28,656 --> 01:08:30,920
And this is not the new model,
I'm guessing.

1398
01:08:30,959 --> 01:08:33,257
- This is the experimental prototype.
- I see.

1399
01:08:33,294 --> 01:08:35,626
Schmuck!

1400
01:08:35,663 --> 01:08:39,292
- This runs on air pressure, right?
- Correct.

1401
01:08:39,334 --> 01:08:41,461
Basically, we've got
150 atmospheres

1402
01:08:41,503 --> 01:08:43,471
of pressure here.

1403
01:08:43,505 --> 01:08:45,973
We've got the turning it on,
turning it off here.

1404
01:08:46,007 --> 01:08:48,168
So air is okay.

1405
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:51,144
- Air good. Fire bad.
- Fire bad.

1406
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:53,511
Fire bad!

1407
01:08:53,548 --> 01:08:55,641
We've taken an old bicycle...

1408
01:08:58,019 --> 01:09:00,146
- I forgot what it's called.
- Tire.

1409
01:09:00,188 --> 01:09:03,453
Okay. Air goes in,
air goes out.

1410
01:09:03,491 --> 01:09:05,152
If I was a person
in that wheelchair,

1411
01:09:05,193 --> 01:09:08,253
I might say to myself,
"Why am I going to these lengths

1412
01:09:08,296 --> 01:09:11,788
to please God, who's taken away
my legs to begin with?"

1413
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:15,166
Okay.

1414
01:09:15,203 --> 01:09:17,330
That would be fascinating.
It's an elevator.

1415
01:09:17,372 --> 01:09:19,397
Oh, it's a Shabbatavator.

1416
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,499
Let me guess,
you can't push a button...

1417
01:09:21,543 --> 01:09:24,068
- Correct.
...on the Sabbath.

1418
01:09:24,112 --> 01:09:27,878
The issues behind the scenes that
people don't see are the real problems.

1419
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:30,214
An even bigger problem might
be how do you get someone

1420
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:33,880
to put this in their building if
they're not completely nuts?

1421
01:09:33,922 --> 01:09:36,447
Well, actually, that really
doesn't make a difference.

1422
01:09:36,491 --> 01:09:37,719
Hmm.

1423
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,250
How we define what is
crazy or not crazy

1424
01:09:40,295 --> 01:09:44,857
about religions is ultimately up
to how we define crazy.

1425
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:47,561
If you define mental illness
as anyone who hears a voice

1426
01:09:47,602 --> 01:09:51,038
talking to them, then anyone who has
heard the voice of God is crazy.

1427
01:10:09,057 --> 01:10:10,854
She talks about a prophecy

1428
01:10:10,892 --> 01:10:14,020
that these children needed to die.

1429
01:10:15,697 --> 01:10:18,427
The dispatcher asked
"Why did you do this?"

1430
01:10:18,466 --> 01:10:21,299
"I was told to."
"Who told you?" "God."

1431
01:10:24,706 --> 01:10:26,674
There is nothing

1432
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:29,074
He may not ask of thee?

1433
01:10:30,411 --> 01:10:32,470
But in layman's terms,
Jesus was nuts.

1434
01:10:32,513 --> 01:10:35,243
Moses..."Stay here,
I'm going up

1435
01:10:35,283 --> 01:10:37,376
and getting the 10 Commandments
right from God."

1436
01:10:37,418 --> 01:10:39,477
You know, 'cause one
thing I've also...

1437
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,114
We didn't have brain-scan technology
back then, so it's a hard to tell.

1438
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:44,920
I know, but if a guy says he went
up on a mountain and he talked to God,

1439
01:10:44,959 --> 01:10:46,984
and He talked to him
through a burning bush,

1440
01:10:47,028 --> 01:10:48,962
that guy's a cuckoo.

1441
01:11:07,315 --> 01:11:09,647
All those pastors who refer to me

1442
01:11:09,684 --> 01:11:12,653
as the anti-Christ, false prophet,

1443
01:11:12,687 --> 01:11:15,247
it's because they're miserable.

1444
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:18,885
Anyone who doesn't believe
in me is miserable.

1445
01:11:24,599 --> 01:11:27,193
- My mike is on?
- Yes, sir.

1446
01:11:27,235 --> 01:11:29,533
Okay, who are you Biblically?

1447
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:34,303
I am Jesus Christ man,
the second coming of Christ, I am.

1448
01:11:34,342 --> 01:11:36,640
The Old Testament speaks
about me clearly

1449
01:11:36,678 --> 01:11:38,339
and the New Testament also.

1450
01:11:38,379 --> 01:11:40,779
- About you personally?
- Yes.

1451
01:11:40,815 --> 01:11:44,216
Not just because you have...
you share the name Jesus?

1452
01:11:44,252 --> 01:11:47,016
- No, not because of that.
- You also share the name Miranda.

1453
01:11:47,055 --> 01:11:48,750
Maybe you're Carmen Miranda.

1454
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:50,781
Maybe the second coming of her?

1455
01:11:50,825 --> 01:11:54,317
You should have fruit on your head,
instead of fruit in your head.

1456
01:11:56,331 --> 01:11:57,992
Okay. Fuck you.
How's that?

1457
01:11:58,032 --> 01:12:01,433
Why do you think
God chose you?

1458
01:12:01,469 --> 01:12:04,495
Jesus of Nazareth had a wife

1459
01:12:04,539 --> 01:12:07,474
so after they killed him,

1460
01:12:07,508 --> 01:12:11,444
his seed kept going,
maybe through France, Spain,

1461
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:14,812
and then from Spain,
came to Puerto Rico.

1462
01:12:16,651 --> 01:12:19,984
The bloodline come
from Abraham, Abraham to David,

1463
01:12:20,021 --> 01:12:21,682
David to Jesus of Nazareth,

1464
01:12:21,723 --> 01:12:24,351
Jesus of Nazareth, me.

1465
01:12:24,392 --> 01:12:26,883
Okay, I though a second coming

1466
01:12:26,928 --> 01:12:29,726
was the reincarnation

1467
01:12:29,764 --> 01:12:31,994
of the Christ himself,

1468
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:34,263
not a descendant of.

1469
01:12:34,302 --> 01:12:36,167
No, he's a descendant.

1470
01:12:36,204 --> 01:12:39,332
Descendant? Oh... but
you don't believe in hell?

1471
01:12:39,374 --> 01:12:41,433
- No.
- Or the Devil?

1472
01:12:41,476 --> 01:12:44,001
- No.
- Or even sin, right?

1473
01:12:44,045 --> 01:12:46,309
No, there's not
a sin any longer.

1474
01:12:46,347 --> 01:12:50,306
What you teach is that
Jesus died for our sins

1475
01:12:50,351 --> 01:12:53,787
and so there's not really
any sinning anymore.

1476
01:12:53,821 --> 01:12:57,416
- No more sin.
- This is like a diet doctor saying,

1477
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:59,255
- "Eat anything you want."
- Right.

1478
01:12:59,293 --> 01:13:01,557
"You don't lose weight,
but it's easy to stick to."

1479
01:13:01,596 --> 01:13:02,722
That's what I believe, Bill.

1480
01:13:02,764 --> 01:13:04,664
Oh, I know you do.

1481
01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:07,259
And I have many people
who believe in this.

1482
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:09,269
And yet, you have a little...
you have a little twinkle

1483
01:13:09,303 --> 01:13:11,271
in your eye when say it.

1484
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:14,331
No, I believe in that.
I believe.

1485
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:18,334
How do we know? Because lots
of people would like this job.

1486
01:13:18,379 --> 01:13:20,244
How do you get this job
as the second coming?

1487
01:13:20,281 --> 01:13:21,839
It's not on Craigslist.

1488
01:13:21,883 --> 01:13:24,443
- Yeah.
- I'm guessing. Maybe it is.

1489
01:13:24,485 --> 01:13:25,611
See, two angels...

1490
01:13:25,653 --> 01:13:27,917
Two guys named Angel,
Spanish guys.

1491
01:13:29,323 --> 01:13:31,018
You know what I'm talking about,

1492
01:13:31,059 --> 01:13:33,619
you fucking cockroach!

1493
01:13:33,661 --> 01:13:35,629
- No.
- Oh, actual angels.

1494
01:13:35,663 --> 01:13:37,961
- Two angels came to me...
- Okay.

1495
01:13:37,999 --> 01:13:40,263
...and they told me

1496
01:13:40,301 --> 01:13:42,792
"The Lord of Lords
and King of Kings

1497
01:13:42,837 --> 01:13:45,738
is coming to anoint you
for the ministry tonight."

1498
01:13:45,773 --> 01:13:48,367
What form did the angels come in?
How tall?

1499
01:13:48,409 --> 01:13:50,400
Little tall and strong.

1500
01:13:50,445 --> 01:13:52,242
Whatever they told me,
I obey.

1501
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,373
I don't wanna mess
with them.

1502
01:13:54,415 --> 01:13:55,939
But I'm just saying,

1503
01:13:55,983 --> 01:13:58,577
it seems that if God wanted

1504
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:00,917
to communicate something
to the world...

1505
01:14:00,955 --> 01:14:03,082
He's all powerful...

1506
01:14:03,124 --> 01:14:06,218
He would just talk
to the whole world.

1507
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:09,627
It always seems
He picks out a prophet in private

1508
01:14:09,664 --> 01:14:12,599
and tells them,
"Okay, you're the prophet."

1509
01:14:12,633 --> 01:14:15,295
- I am.
- "You go tell the rest of the world."

1510
01:14:15,336 --> 01:14:17,065
So we just sort of
have to take it on faith.

1511
01:14:17,105 --> 01:14:19,300
We just sort of
have to believe you.

1512
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,467
Right, yeah, it's true.

1513
01:14:24,512 --> 01:14:27,504
Abraham. Noah.

1514
01:14:27,548 --> 01:14:30,073
Lord, what shall I do?

1515
01:14:30,118 --> 01:14:31,608
Moses,

1516
01:14:31,652 --> 01:14:34,177
climb the mount alone.

1517
01:14:34,222 --> 01:14:37,157
Once again, the Lord had
spoken to Joseph Smith

1518
01:14:37,191 --> 01:14:39,591
as he had to Adam, Abraham,

1519
01:14:39,627 --> 01:14:43,358
Moses, Paul and others.

1520
01:14:43,397 --> 01:14:45,422
I am the first Christian.

1521
01:14:45,466 --> 01:14:49,095
And the rest are really
kind of Jewish, you're saying,

1522
01:14:49,137 --> 01:14:51,162
because they're following a Jew.

1523
01:14:51,205 --> 01:14:52,832
That's it.

1524
01:14:52,874 --> 01:14:54,842
In fact, they put on the plates...

1525
01:14:54,876 --> 01:14:57,743
they say "My boss is
a Jewish carpenter."

1526
01:14:57,778 --> 01:15:01,270
How ridiculous is that?
A Jewish carpenter!

1527
01:15:01,315 --> 01:15:03,783
- Imagine.
- Come on, Jews hire carpenters.

1528
01:15:03,818 --> 01:15:05,445
They don't...

1529
01:15:05,486 --> 01:15:08,785
you know, people say
"I found my calling in life."

1530
01:15:08,823 --> 01:15:11,053
And it's a good calling.
It's a nice living.

1531
01:15:11,092 --> 01:15:13,458
People adore you.
Everywhere you go,

1532
01:15:13,494 --> 01:15:16,327
they treat you like Christ,
like you're the Messiah.

1533
01:15:16,364 --> 01:15:19,765
You know, if I discovered
that I was Satan in person,

1534
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,665
I would do a good job, too,

1535
01:15:21,702 --> 01:15:24,170
because I would be
faithful to my calling.

1536
01:15:24,205 --> 01:15:26,469
It's how you do
your work, isn't it?

1537
01:15:26,507 --> 01:15:28,441
You know, at the end of the day,
whether you're the Messiah

1538
01:15:28,476 --> 01:15:30,944
or you're Satan,
it's loving what you do

1539
01:15:30,978 --> 01:15:32,741
and giving it 100%.

1540
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:34,714
I give 100%.

1541
01:15:34,749 --> 01:15:38,480
I wasn't born skeptical.

1542
01:15:38,519 --> 01:15:41,647
I was still making deals
with "God" when I was 40.

1543
01:15:41,689 --> 01:15:43,589
I remember I quit smoking.

1544
01:15:43,624 --> 01:15:46,024
There was some shitty problem
I had in my life,

1545
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,823
and I made
a deal with God,

1546
01:15:47,862 --> 01:15:49,887
"Okay, if you make
this problem go away,

1547
01:15:49,931 --> 01:15:52,798
I will quit smoking,
and I won't go back on it

1548
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:55,563
'cause I'd know I'd be going back
on a deal with God."

1549
01:15:55,603 --> 01:15:57,400
And you know, I gotta say,

1550
01:15:57,438 --> 01:16:00,032
I'm kind of glad I had "God"

1551
01:16:00,074 --> 01:16:01,769
in my life.

1552
01:16:01,809 --> 01:16:04,277
You are the head

1553
01:16:04,312 --> 01:16:08,715
of the First Universal Church
of Cantheism...

1554
01:16:08,749 --> 01:16:11,343
- Yes.
...which is really built around

1555
01:16:11,385 --> 01:16:14,115
- this substance here.
- No.

1556
01:16:14,155 --> 01:16:17,283
No? Okay, I got that wrong.

1557
01:16:17,325 --> 01:16:19,350
But it's built
around smoking this.

1558
01:16:19,393 --> 01:16:21,691
I mean, it has no dogma, right?

1559
01:16:21,729 --> 01:16:23,356
You're not preaching to anybody.
You're not saying

1560
01:16:23,397 --> 01:16:26,127
- you'll save their souls, no rituals.
- No.

1561
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:28,192
How does this differ
from just getting wasted?

1562
01:16:28,236 --> 01:16:30,363
I mean that
in the best possible way, but...

1563
01:16:30,404 --> 01:16:32,599
I understand
the concept of God,

1564
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,803
a feeling of one
with everything else.

1565
01:16:35,843 --> 01:16:38,437
Do you feel that
every time you smoke pot?

1566
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:40,606
No.

1567
01:16:40,648 --> 01:16:42,980
Phew! I thought it was just me.

1568
01:16:43,017 --> 01:16:46,612
So why do you think
it's this family of drugs

1569
01:16:46,654 --> 01:16:49,748
that's so good
for opening our minds

1570
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:51,724
as opposed to ludes, PCP,

1571
01:16:51,759 --> 01:16:55,195
or smashing up your mother's diet pills
and smoking 'em in a pipe?

1572
01:16:56,831 --> 01:16:59,026
I don't know.
I don't know.

1573
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:05,234
So I did want
to get your thoughts

1574
01:17:05,273 --> 01:17:07,867
about what's going on in this city.
This is your city.

1575
01:17:07,908 --> 01:17:10,809
There's a lot
of controversy with...

1576
01:17:10,845 --> 01:17:12,972
maybe the Dutch
are so tolerant

1577
01:17:13,014 --> 01:17:15,949
that they're now
tolerating intolerance.

1578
01:17:15,983 --> 01:17:18,577
There's a lot of tension
with the Muslim community.

1579
01:17:18,619 --> 01:17:21,782
It's all religious fundamentalists.

1580
01:17:21,822 --> 01:17:24,222
They already killed
Theo Van Gogh,

1581
01:17:24,258 --> 01:17:27,352
who was a known
television maker.

1582
01:17:27,395 --> 01:17:30,922
This is the spot
where Theo Van Gogh

1583
01:17:30,965 --> 01:17:33,866
- was assassinated?
- This is exactly the spot.

1584
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:36,426
He was a Dutch filmmaker.
He made a 10-minute film.

1585
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:40,236
It was deeply offensive
to Muslims.

1586
01:17:40,274 --> 01:17:43,573
Oh, Allah, you say
that men are the protectors

1587
01:17:43,611 --> 01:17:45,511
and maintainers of women

1588
01:17:45,546 --> 01:17:48,310
because you have given
the one more strength than the other.

1589
01:17:48,349 --> 01:17:50,078
I feel at least once a week,

1590
01:17:50,117 --> 01:17:52,711
the strength of my husband's fist

1591
01:17:52,753 --> 01:17:54,482
on my face.

1592
01:17:54,522 --> 01:17:57,013
Lots of people think
that free speech

1593
01:17:57,058 --> 01:18:01,825
goes right up to this point and then
when you're talking about religion,

1594
01:18:01,862 --> 01:18:05,354
when you're talking
about the Prophet, all bets are off.

1595
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:07,492
It goes both ways,
freedom of speech.

1596
01:18:07,535 --> 01:18:10,095
It goes both ways,
but the people who actually...

1597
01:18:10,137 --> 01:18:13,971
usually do the killing for it
wind up on the Muslim side.

1598
01:18:14,008 --> 01:18:17,000
Do you think that says something
about the different cultures?

1599
01:18:17,044 --> 01:18:19,478
I don't want to have
the image of the Muslims,

1600
01:18:19,513 --> 01:18:21,174
you know, if they don't like
something you say,

1601
01:18:21,215 --> 01:18:22,682
they kill you, because it's not.

1602
01:18:24,251 --> 01:18:28,017
It was a noisy crowd outside
the Danish embassy in London

1603
01:18:28,055 --> 01:18:31,752
as speakers condemned the cartoons
portraying the Prophet Mohammed.

1604
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:35,284
I wish I could get
your music in America,

1605
01:18:35,329 --> 01:18:39,493
but considering how controversial
it's been here in England...

1606
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:46,804
Initially, when I did the record,

1607
01:18:46,841 --> 01:18:49,036
a lot of people supported it,

1608
01:18:49,076 --> 01:18:52,239
but then,
in the current times that we're in,

1609
01:18:52,279 --> 01:18:53,769
people got really scared.

1610
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:56,305
It just shows
the stupidity of society,

1611
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:59,751
which refuses
to discuss,

1612
01:18:59,787 --> 01:19:02,722
debate things
in an intelligent way.

1613
01:19:02,757 --> 01:19:04,281
And I don't except that.

1614
01:19:04,325 --> 01:19:06,190
I just put my middle finger up.

1615
01:19:06,227 --> 01:19:08,593
One of your big gripes...
and it's a valid one...

1616
01:19:08,629 --> 01:19:11,996
you keep saying that...
in fact, let me read your quote.

1617
01:19:12,032 --> 01:19:14,000
You said, "Anyone worried
about what I'm saying

1618
01:19:14,034 --> 01:19:17,765
should get involved in the debate.
You are allowed to dissent.

1619
01:19:17,805 --> 01:19:20,069
- That is a right."
- Yeah.

1620
01:19:20,107 --> 01:19:23,702
But is that a right
in Islam, to dissent?

1621
01:19:23,744 --> 01:19:25,837
Of course it is. Why do you think
there's so many schools of thought?

1622
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,611
- Why do you think there's...
- It wasn't a right for Salman Rushdie.

1623
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,618
The demonstrators set off
from Hyde Park,

1624
01:19:31,652 --> 01:19:34,314
bringing much
of central London to a standstill.

1625
01:19:34,355 --> 01:19:37,552
Their hatred focused
on Salman Rushdie and his book.

1626
01:19:37,591 --> 01:19:40,424
The mullahs pressed home
their message in thousands of mosques...

1627
01:19:40,461 --> 01:19:42,452
Salman Rushdie must be killed.

1628
01:19:42,496 --> 01:19:45,192
See, Salman Rushdie
was there to provoke,

1629
01:19:45,232 --> 01:19:48,030
insult, and he did it
intentionally, right?

1630
01:19:48,068 --> 01:19:49,729
But should you die
for that?

1631
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:52,102
No no, well, I mean,
like, that was...

1632
01:19:52,139 --> 01:19:53,834
you know, it's easy
for you to say

1633
01:19:53,874 --> 01:19:55,967
things are kind of
in black and white.

1634
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:58,376
They're more complex than that.

1635
01:19:58,412 --> 01:20:00,607
There's emotions and passions

1636
01:20:00,648 --> 01:20:02,639
and philosophy involved

1637
01:20:02,683 --> 01:20:05,277
- and all that stuff.
- You know, all you gotta say is

1638
01:20:05,319 --> 01:20:08,811
it's wrong for someone
to have to suffer a death threat

1639
01:20:08,856 --> 01:20:11,381
- for writing a book.
- Well, hang on.

1640
01:20:11,425 --> 01:20:12,915
But apparently, it's more
complicated than that.

1641
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,690
Well, it is because...
but I mean, Western...

1642
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:18,129
We'll never see
eye to eye there,

1643
01:20:18,165 --> 01:20:20,497
but you want that
protection for yourself.

1644
01:20:20,534 --> 01:20:22,502
No, I think
these debates are a lot...

1645
01:20:22,536 --> 01:20:26,370
I'm willing to discuss 'em
in terms of facts and not fictions.

1646
01:20:26,407 --> 01:20:27,931
When you disagree with me,
it's a fiction.

1647
01:20:27,975 --> 01:20:29,840
- No no.
- You have the truth

1648
01:20:29,877 --> 01:20:31,367
- and I have the fiction.
- No, I don't have the truth.

1649
01:20:31,412 --> 01:20:33,277
But you don't see that
there's a fundamental hypocrisy

1650
01:20:33,314 --> 01:20:35,407
of you asking
for the right to dissent

1651
01:20:35,449 --> 01:20:37,542
and somebody else
getting a death threat?

1652
01:20:37,585 --> 01:20:40,884
No no, 'cause my dissent is
to stop the madness.

1653
01:20:46,293 --> 01:20:48,318
I'm here with Geert Wilders
here in The Hague,

1654
01:20:48,362 --> 01:20:49,989
which of course is
home to the World Court,

1655
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:51,827
but also to the Dutch Parliament.

1656
01:20:51,866 --> 01:20:54,994
You are taking
a kind of hard line here

1657
01:20:55,035 --> 01:20:56,730
in the Netherlands.

1658
01:20:56,770 --> 01:21:00,069
Islam is, according to me,
a violent religion.

1659
01:21:00,107 --> 01:21:02,075
The Koran is a violent book

1660
01:21:02,109 --> 01:21:04,077
and Mohammed was
a violent prophet.

1661
01:21:04,111 --> 01:21:06,579
Do you think Islam wants
to take over the world?

1662
01:21:06,614 --> 01:21:08,775
- They don't even make...
- Right right.

1663
01:21:08,816 --> 01:21:10,511
...a secret about it.

1664
01:21:10,551 --> 01:21:12,075
We are infidels.

1665
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:15,350
I mean, we should either become
Islamic or we should be killed.

1666
01:21:15,389 --> 01:21:17,482
This is what they say.
This is what they are proud of.

1667
01:21:17,525 --> 01:21:19,857
Okay, we're here at Habibi Ana.

1668
01:21:19,894 --> 01:21:21,919
- Did I say that right?
- Yeah.

1669
01:21:21,962 --> 01:21:23,896
You guys, really...
I mean,

1670
01:21:23,931 --> 01:21:25,865
gay Muslim activists,

1671
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:29,427
that is a very rare job description.
You guys have balls.

1672
01:21:31,105 --> 01:21:32,800
How big is
the gay community...

1673
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,037
the gay Muslim community
here in Amsterdam?

1674
01:21:36,076 --> 01:21:38,374
Or is this it?

1675
01:21:38,412 --> 01:21:42,371
I mean, I'm guessing,
Thursday isn't...

1676
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:45,112
isn't gay night here.

1677
01:21:45,152 --> 01:21:47,712
I hope you guys find
each other attractive,

1678
01:21:47,755 --> 01:21:49,848
'cause otherwise...

1679
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:51,289
you don't feel afraid?

1680
01:21:51,325 --> 01:21:52,724
Here in Holland I'm not,

1681
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,228
but when I came from my country,
I was very afraid.

1682
01:21:55,262 --> 01:21:56,559
There was an article of law:

1683
01:21:56,597 --> 01:21:58,758
Punish the gay
for one year just because he's gay.

1684
01:21:58,799 --> 01:22:01,359
- Just being gay can get you a year.
- Just being gay.

1685
01:22:01,402 --> 01:22:02,960
Same as Alabama.

1686
01:22:04,405 --> 01:22:07,203
What I learned is that
they're not really...

1687
01:22:07,241 --> 01:22:09,869
they're not specific
against homosexuality.

1688
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:12,470
They're not specific against,
in other words,

1689
01:22:12,513 --> 01:22:14,947
the desire
of a man for a man.

1690
01:22:14,982 --> 01:22:18,474
What they are against
is specific behavior,

1691
01:22:18,519 --> 01:22:20,282
like anal sex.

1692
01:22:20,321 --> 01:22:24,417
They don't say homosexuality,
heterosexuality.

1693
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:27,256
They just don't want you doing it
in the naughty place,

1694
01:22:27,294 --> 01:22:28,852
which I guess,

1695
01:22:28,896 --> 01:22:31,592
if you put that out
of the picture in homosexuality,

1696
01:22:31,632 --> 01:22:35,124
what do you have left?
Just the blowjob.

1697
01:22:37,004 --> 01:22:38,562
What do you think
when people say

1698
01:22:38,606 --> 01:22:40,870
it affects your memory,

1699
01:22:40,908 --> 01:22:43,103
especially your
short-term memory?

1700
01:22:43,143 --> 01:22:46,340
- It does.
- And what do you think when people say

1701
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,816
that it affects your memory,
your short-term memory?

1702
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:51,647
It does.

1703
01:22:53,988 --> 01:22:57,446
- I like my hat.
- It's good. You look good, too.

1704
01:22:57,491 --> 01:22:59,618
I think I do.
I think I might adopt this look.

1705
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:00,649
Yes.

1706
01:23:00,694 --> 01:23:02,924
Is there a reason
why you have a black hat

1707
01:23:02,963 --> 01:23:04,487
and I have a white hat?

1708
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:06,863
We have any color you like.

1709
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,869
So I bought this.
I like it myself

1710
01:23:09,903 --> 01:23:12,098
because I like the color.

1711
01:23:12,139 --> 01:23:15,939
There is a lot of tension
in the last five years or so.

1712
01:23:15,976 --> 01:23:19,969
Is Islam a threat
to Dutch values?

1713
01:23:20,014 --> 01:23:22,505
Islam is preaching,

1714
01:23:22,549 --> 01:23:24,540
above all, peace.

1715
01:23:24,585 --> 01:23:26,815
Peace, peace and peace.

1716
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:51,509
The name Islam means peace.

1717
01:23:51,545 --> 01:23:53,843
And yet it is involved
in a lot of war and violence.

1718
01:23:53,881 --> 01:23:55,746
Yeah, it's just all politics.

1719
01:23:55,783 --> 01:23:57,648
- Nothing to do with religion?
- No no.

1720
01:23:57,685 --> 01:23:59,312
- No?
- No, sir.

1721
01:23:59,353 --> 01:24:01,321
- It's political.
- It's politics.

1722
01:24:01,355 --> 01:24:03,152
Seems to be
a lot of passages

1723
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:05,590
that say the infidel

1724
01:24:05,626 --> 01:24:08,925
is not the equal
of the believer.

1725
01:24:08,962 --> 01:24:11,021
The infidel will die in hell.

1726
01:24:11,065 --> 01:24:14,034
Don't feel bad
about hating the infidel.

1727
01:24:14,068 --> 01:24:17,196
- No.
- No?

1728
01:24:17,237 --> 01:24:19,228
Boy, I've got
bad information.

1729
01:24:19,273 --> 01:24:20,535
Yes, you have.
I think so.

1730
01:24:20,574 --> 01:24:23,168
- No no no no no.
- No no no no.

1731
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:24,768
- No no no no.
- No.

1732
01:24:24,812 --> 01:24:27,440
No? No. I'm wrong
about everything.

1733
01:24:27,481 --> 01:24:31,212
The way I perceive things in the Koran
is not about killing infidels.

1734
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:34,015
- But you have read it in there?
- Of course I've read the Koran.

1735
01:24:34,054 --> 01:24:36,887
You've read those passages, and what
did you think when you read them?

1736
01:24:36,924 --> 01:24:39,449
No, but I explain those
passages within the time

1737
01:24:39,493 --> 01:24:41,586
in which they emerged
in the world.

1738
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:43,118
That's not how people
read holy books.

1739
01:24:43,163 --> 01:24:44,755
People don't read
holy books and go,

1740
01:24:44,798 --> 01:24:47,460
"Well, that was good for then."
People who read holy books and go,

1741
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:49,662
"This is the word of God.
It's forever!"

1742
01:24:49,703 --> 01:24:52,604
- No, I don't agree.
- That's how most people do it.

1743
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:55,233
I just don't buy it
that these guys are

1744
01:24:55,275 --> 01:24:57,539
in this state of denial.

1745
01:24:57,578 --> 01:25:00,274
I think they're just
in a state of denial

1746
01:25:00,314 --> 01:25:02,305
to an outsider.

1747
01:25:02,349 --> 01:25:05,079
They will not admit
anything is wrong

1748
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:07,815
with their culture
to an outsider.

1749
01:25:07,855 --> 01:25:09,948
Muslims were imperialists

1750
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:12,720
in the century
after Mohammed's death.

1751
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,422
They conquered most
of the known world

1752
01:25:15,462 --> 01:25:17,157
in one century.

1753
01:25:17,197 --> 01:25:20,132
Yeah, it is possible.

1754
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:22,067
You call it conquer.

1755
01:25:22,102 --> 01:25:23,831
I think they were trying

1756
01:25:23,871 --> 01:25:26,840
to spread Islam.

1757
01:25:26,874 --> 01:25:30,469
Well, they were, but they weren't doing
it by singing "Kumbaya."

1758
01:25:30,511 --> 01:25:32,445
Excuse me.

1759
01:25:33,614 --> 01:25:35,309
Sorry.

1760
01:25:35,349 --> 01:25:38,341
Oh, that 21st century's
always busting in.

1761
01:25:40,387 --> 01:25:42,412
I'm going to shut it off.

1762
01:25:42,456 --> 01:25:46,415
I love it that he's got "Kashmir"
as his ringtone.

1763
01:25:51,165 --> 01:25:53,156
Okay, I shut it off.

1764
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,498
- Sorry, I was...
- Yeah...

1765
01:25:57,571 --> 01:25:58,560
Politics, okay.

1766
01:26:01,308 --> 01:26:04,300
Do you think it's possible
that when we're on something

1767
01:26:04,344 --> 01:26:06,175
like marijuana
or mushrooms

1768
01:26:06,213 --> 01:26:09,273
and believe we're having a very
spiritual experience,

1769
01:26:09,316 --> 01:26:11,841
that we're just high?

1770
01:26:11,885 --> 01:26:14,979
- It's... it's...
- Oh, look out your head's on fire!

1771
01:26:15,022 --> 01:26:17,217
Boy, talk about
the light bulb going off,

1772
01:26:17,257 --> 01:26:20,715
- that was your whole head.
- I don't like candles behind me.

1773
01:26:20,761 --> 01:26:23,958
No. Oh, look,
I found another joint.

1774
01:26:23,997 --> 01:26:25,988
Uh-oh.

1775
01:26:27,434 --> 01:26:29,868
Can we get closer?

1776
01:26:29,903 --> 01:26:33,031
That is one hell of a wall.

1777
01:26:49,256 --> 01:26:50,621
This is the Dome of the Rock?

1778
01:26:50,657 --> 01:26:53,751
This is the Dome of the Rock.
According to Islam...

1779
01:26:59,032 --> 01:27:00,397
On a horse?

1780
01:27:07,541 --> 01:27:08,633
He went to heaven on the horse?

1781
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:11,109
Why is it holy for the Jews?

1782
01:27:35,402 --> 01:27:37,836
A rock. The Kaaba?

1783
01:27:37,871 --> 01:27:39,532
Isn't that...

1784
01:27:41,808 --> 01:27:43,332
Stone, rock, the same thing.

1785
01:27:44,945 --> 01:27:47,038
Why is that holy?

1786
01:27:50,117 --> 01:27:51,141
Paradise.

1787
01:27:51,184 --> 01:27:54,915
Could the rock itself have been
what we know now to be like a meteor?

1788
01:27:58,492 --> 01:28:01,120
But does it make a difference
that we now understand

1789
01:28:01,161 --> 01:28:02,628
what a meteor is?

1790
01:28:03,931 --> 01:28:04,955
Yes, right.

1791
01:28:04,998 --> 01:28:06,625
Okay.

1792
01:28:06,667 --> 01:28:08,635
This is the Mount
of Olives.

1793
01:28:08,669 --> 01:28:11,900
A lot of Orthodox Jews want
to be buried here,

1794
01:28:11,939 --> 01:28:14,339
'cause they believe that
when the Messiah comes,

1795
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:16,467
he will raise them from
the dead and march them through

1796
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:19,775
that golden gate
and onto the Temple Mount,

1797
01:28:19,813 --> 01:28:23,442
which is why the Muslims
have walled up the gate.

1798
01:28:23,483 --> 01:28:25,917
The better to keep out
the Jewish Messiah

1799
01:28:25,953 --> 01:28:28,353
and his kosher zombies
from getting in.

1800
01:28:28,388 --> 01:28:32,290
Although you'd think that
if you had the power to raise the dead,

1801
01:28:32,326 --> 01:28:34,624
you'd have the power
to jump a fence.

1802
01:28:36,897 --> 01:28:38,524
I thought I would not be allowed

1803
01:28:38,565 --> 01:28:41,125
to walk in a mosque.

1804
01:28:41,168 --> 01:28:42,635
I thought only someone of your faith

1805
01:28:42,669 --> 01:28:44,398
was allowed to do that.

1806
01:28:59,052 --> 01:29:01,077
Why is he angry?

1807
01:29:02,723 --> 01:29:04,315
They're angry that
you're talking to me?

1808
01:29:11,031 --> 01:29:13,693
Women in your culture

1809
01:29:13,734 --> 01:29:16,202
seem not to be as equal

1810
01:29:16,236 --> 01:29:18,602
to the man as they
are in our culture.

1811
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:21,700
Yes.

1812
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:25,944
I talked to a Muslim scholar today.

1813
01:29:25,979 --> 01:29:30,075
And he said that Mohammed
had a meeting here.

1814
01:29:38,425 --> 01:29:41,690
Mohammed never set his foot

1815
01:29:41,728 --> 01:29:45,061
on that Temple Mount,
not even one foot.

1816
01:29:45,098 --> 01:29:47,726
Never ever.

1817
01:29:47,768 --> 01:29:51,363
He was never in the land
of Israel, that's a historical fact.

1818
01:30:02,049 --> 01:30:04,415
I think even
I understand that.

1819
01:30:04,451 --> 01:30:08,182
Why can't the people
of the different faiths get along?

1820
01:30:08,221 --> 01:30:12,180
All three religions
consider the same site

1821
01:30:12,225 --> 01:30:14,216
to be holy.

1822
01:30:16,063 --> 01:30:18,554
Is it not because it was
conquered many times?

1823
01:30:18,598 --> 01:30:22,591
- Yes.
- It was conquered first by King David,

1824
01:30:22,636 --> 01:30:24,604
and then later by
the armies coming out

1825
01:30:24,638 --> 01:30:27,471
of the Arabian Desert.

1826
01:30:27,507 --> 01:30:29,202
- It changed hands during the crusades.
- We had the Romans.

1827
01:30:29,242 --> 01:30:30,800
We had the Byzantines.
We had the Persians.

1828
01:30:34,614 --> 01:30:37,378
There's more than
one mosque in the world

1829
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:40,318
that used to be a church,
and before that was a temple.

1830
01:30:40,353 --> 01:30:43,789
Because it's a lot easier
just to change the sign on the top

1831
01:30:43,824 --> 01:30:45,257
and say
"under new management"

1832
01:30:45,292 --> 01:30:47,886
than it is to change
the whole building.

1833
01:30:47,928 --> 01:30:49,896
I worked a lot
of comedy clubs in the '80s

1834
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:52,797
that still had
the disco ball on the ceiling.

1835
01:30:52,833 --> 01:30:55,301
And in the '90s,
they became strip clubs

1836
01:30:55,335 --> 01:30:57,929
and now
they're a Starbucks.

1837
01:30:57,971 --> 01:31:01,930
I've come today to the village
of Cerne Abbas in Southern England

1838
01:31:01,975 --> 01:31:05,433
to show you something
completely different.

1839
01:31:05,479 --> 01:31:08,414
It's in the shape
of a giant naked man

1840
01:31:08,448 --> 01:31:11,747
with a sizable erection...
well, sizable for England.

1841
01:31:11,785 --> 01:31:13,275
Some people think
that this means

1842
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,448
that there is a giant actually
buried under that hill.

1843
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:18,458
Others think it has something
to do with crop circles

1844
01:31:18,492 --> 01:31:21,552
or ancient space visitors
or Druids,

1845
01:31:21,595 --> 01:31:23,563
but nobody really knows.

1846
01:31:23,597 --> 01:31:26,088
And that's what
I find fascinating about this,

1847
01:31:26,133 --> 01:31:28,761
is that it doesn't
really mean anything.

1848
01:31:28,802 --> 01:31:31,600
The locals have been
maintaining it for centuries,

1849
01:31:31,638 --> 01:31:33,663
and they don't
really know why.

1850
01:31:33,707 --> 01:31:35,732
They just do it because
they've always done it,

1851
01:31:35,775 --> 01:31:37,970
and isn't that
religion for you?

1852
01:31:38,011 --> 01:31:41,310
Sometimes you kneel,
sometimes you fast

1853
01:31:41,348 --> 01:31:43,407
and sometimes
you go up on the hill

1854
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:46,510
and you cut the grass
around the giant space penis.

1855
01:31:46,553 --> 01:31:48,680
Do you believe,
as so many Christians do nowadays,

1856
01:31:48,722 --> 01:31:50,690
that the world will end?

1857
01:31:50,724 --> 01:31:53,716
I think we are in the end times.
There are many many signs.

1858
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,160
The world as we know it
will come to an end.

1859
01:31:56,196 --> 01:31:57,663
And beyond that,

1860
01:31:57,697 --> 01:32:00,996
there will be the glorious
second coming of Jesus Christ.

1861
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:06,498
It seems peaceful,

1862
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:09,771
but this is the very spot where
a lot of Christians believe

1863
01:32:09,809 --> 01:32:11,504
life on earth will end.

1864
01:32:11,545 --> 01:32:13,979
The irony of religion
is that because

1865
01:32:14,014 --> 01:32:16,710
of its power to divert man

1866
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:19,116
to destructive courses,

1867
01:32:19,152 --> 01:32:22,246
the world actually
could come to an end.

1868
01:32:22,289 --> 01:32:24,883
A lot of people
in this country believe

1869
01:32:24,925 --> 01:32:26,324
in end times.

1870
01:32:26,359 --> 01:32:28,987
There will be this great
reckoning, the Rapture.

1871
01:32:29,029 --> 01:32:31,759
- Do you believe that?
- I do.

1872
01:32:38,805 --> 01:32:41,365
But if you believe that the world is
gonna come to an end,

1873
01:32:41,408 --> 01:32:43,376
and perhaps any day now,

1874
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:46,072
does it not drain
one's motivation

1875
01:32:46,112 --> 01:32:48,546
to improve life on earth
while we're here?

1876
01:32:59,593 --> 01:33:02,255
The plain fact is,
religion must die

1877
01:33:02,295 --> 01:33:04,456
for mankind to live.

1878
01:33:04,497 --> 01:33:07,432
The hour is getting very late
to be able to indulge

1879
01:33:07,467 --> 01:33:11,096
in having key decisions made
by religious people,

1880
01:33:11,137 --> 01:33:14,265
by irrationalists, by those
who would steer the ship of state

1881
01:33:14,307 --> 01:33:17,276
not by a compass,
but by the equivalent

1882
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:19,710
of reading the entrails
of a chicken.

1883
01:33:19,746 --> 01:33:22,078
George Bush prayed
a lot about Iraq,

1884
01:33:22,115 --> 01:33:23,946
but he didn't learn
a lot about it.

1885
01:33:23,984 --> 01:33:25,451
I don't know that much
about politics,

1886
01:33:25,485 --> 01:33:27,077
I'll vote for President Bush
because of his faith.

1887
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:31,386
Faith means making
a virtue out of not thinking.

1888
01:33:31,424 --> 01:33:33,051
It's nothing to brag about.

1889
01:33:33,093 --> 01:33:35,926
And those who preach faith
and enable and elevate it

1890
01:33:35,962 --> 01:33:38,590
are our intellectual slaveholders,

1891
01:33:38,632 --> 01:33:40,930
keeping mankind in a bondage

1892
01:33:40,967 --> 01:33:42,958
to fantasy and nonsense

1893
01:33:43,003 --> 01:33:44,800
that has spawned and justified

1894
01:33:44,838 --> 01:33:47,966
so much lunacy and destruction.

1895
01:33:48,008 --> 01:33:51,307
Religion is dangerous
because it allows human beings

1896
01:33:51,344 --> 01:33:52,811
who don't have all the answers

1897
01:33:52,846 --> 01:33:54,905
to think that they do.

1898
01:33:54,948 --> 01:33:56,916
Most people would think
it's wonderful when someone says,

1899
01:33:56,950 --> 01:34:00,147
"I'm willing, Lord.
I'll do whatever You want me to do."

1900
01:34:00,186 --> 01:34:04,282
Except that since there
are no gods actually talking to us,

1901
01:34:04,324 --> 01:34:07,953
that void is filled in by people
with their own corruptions,

1902
01:34:07,994 --> 01:34:11,486
- limitations and agendas.
- It's going to happen,

1903
01:34:11,531 --> 01:34:13,556
and I'm not saying
necessarily nuclear...

1904
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,965
The Lord didn't say nuclear...

1905
01:34:15,001 --> 01:34:17,162
but I do believe it'll
be something like that.

1906
01:34:17,203 --> 01:34:18,932
And anyone who tells you
they know...

1907
01:34:18,972 --> 01:34:21,964
they just know
what happens when you die,

1908
01:34:22,008 --> 01:34:23,908
I promise you, you don't.

1909
01:34:23,943 --> 01:34:27,276
How can I be so sure?
Because I don't know,

1910
01:34:27,314 --> 01:34:30,511
and you do not possess
mental powers that I do not.

1911
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:33,144
The only appropriate attitude
for man to have

1912
01:34:33,186 --> 01:34:35,654
about the big questions

1913
01:34:35,689 --> 01:34:38,055
is not the arrogant certitude

1914
01:34:38,091 --> 01:34:40,116
that is the hallmark of religion,

1915
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:43,129
but doubt. Doubt is humble,

1916
01:34:43,163 --> 01:34:44,994
and that's what
man needs to be,

1917
01:34:45,031 --> 01:34:48,694
considering that human history
is just a litany

1918
01:34:48,735 --> 01:34:51,727
of getting shit dead wrong.

1919
01:34:51,771 --> 01:34:54,239
Jesus is coming back
to rescue the Jews,

1920
01:34:54,274 --> 01:34:56,674
because he is
the only one that can.

1921
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:59,178
The believer goes in the paradise.

1922
01:34:59,212 --> 01:35:02,545
Unbeliever, they will go to hell.

1923
01:35:02,582 --> 01:35:05,915
The Jews are the only reason
that I am a Christian.

1924
01:35:05,952 --> 01:35:08,045
- I love them.
- But you're not gonna take them

1925
01:35:08,088 --> 01:35:10,682
- to heaven with you, are you?
- I'm gonna go in the Rapture,

1926
01:35:10,724 --> 01:35:13,522
and I'm gonna come back
on a white horse.

1927
01:35:23,703 --> 01:35:26,729
So you think Jesus
will end this earth at some point,

1928
01:35:26,773 --> 01:35:28,400
maybe in your lifetime?

1929
01:35:28,441 --> 01:35:30,409
One always hopes.
This is a sign, and that is a sign.

1930
01:35:30,443 --> 01:35:32,536
If a nuclear bomb went off,

1931
01:35:32,579 --> 01:35:35,412
and it seemed like that was
exactly what it had said,

1932
01:35:35,448 --> 01:35:37,916
balls of fire or something,

1933
01:35:37,951 --> 01:35:39,885
you wouldn't look on that
as necessarily a bad thing.

1934
01:35:39,919 --> 01:35:41,546
I know I'll be with God.

1935
01:35:41,588 --> 01:35:43,556
This is why rational people,

1936
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:45,217
anti-religionists,

1937
01:35:45,258 --> 01:35:47,226
must end their timidity
and come out of the closet

1938
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:49,057
and assert themselves.

1939
01:35:49,095 --> 01:35:52,292
And those who consider themselves
only moderately religious

1940
01:35:52,332 --> 01:35:54,391
really need to look
in the mirror and realize

1941
01:35:54,434 --> 01:35:57,028
that the solace and comfort
that religion brings you

1942
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:59,868
actually comes
at a terrible price.

1943
01:35:59,906 --> 01:36:02,932
It says in the last days
there'll be wars, rumors of wars.

1944
01:36:02,976 --> 01:36:05,206
The Bible prophesies
from the Book of Revelation...

1945
01:36:05,245 --> 01:36:07,236
they're going to be fulfilled!

1946
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,248
Can this be accomplished
without violence?

1947
01:36:09,282 --> 01:36:12,445
- No.
- Islam ruling the world,

1948
01:36:12,485 --> 01:36:13,782
global jihad.

1949
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:15,412
- Who will win out?
- We'll win.

1950
01:36:15,455 --> 01:36:17,719
That's for God to decide
on Judgment Day.

1951
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,831
If you belonged to a political
party or a social club

1952
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:34,237
that was tied
to as much bigotry, misogyny,

1953
01:36:34,274 --> 01:36:36,003
homophobia, violence

1954
01:36:36,042 --> 01:36:38,272
and sheer ignorance
as religion is,

1955
01:36:38,311 --> 01:36:39,869
you'd resign in protest.

1956
01:36:39,913 --> 01:36:42,347
To do otherwise is
to be an enabler,

1957
01:36:42,382 --> 01:36:44,179
a Mafia wife,

1958
01:36:44,217 --> 01:36:46,947
with the true devils of extremism

1959
01:36:46,986 --> 01:36:48,419
that draw their legitimacy

1960
01:36:48,455 --> 01:36:50,821
from the billions
of their fellow travelers.

1961
01:36:50,857 --> 01:36:54,520
If the world does come
to an end here or wherever,

1962
01:36:54,561 --> 01:36:57,655
or if it limps into the future,
decimated by the effects

1963
01:36:57,697 --> 01:37:00,757
of a religion-inspired
nuclear terrorism,

1964
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,961
let's remember
what the real problem was:

1965
01:37:03,002 --> 01:37:06,130
That we learned how
to precipitate mass death

1966
01:37:06,172 --> 01:37:09,005
before we got past
the neurological disorder

1967
01:37:09,042 --> 01:37:11,408
of wishing for it.

1968
01:37:11,444 --> 01:37:15,175
That's it. Grow up or die.

1969
01:37:17,484 --> 01:37:21,443
We are in a conflict
between good and evil.

1970
01:40:43,523 --> 01:40:46,083
See you in heaven.

1971
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:47,752
Who knows?

1972
01:40:49,162 --> 01:40:51,130
Yeah, exactly.
