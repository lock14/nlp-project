1
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:49,525
It's 6:42 a.m.

2
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:55,364
Beth's Dad's place.

3
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,037
He's out of town.

4
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,002
And it's already a good day.

5
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:40,909
Beth.

6
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,623
- Rob, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

7
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:48,376
- Well, then stop.
- Nothing.

8
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,418
- That's...
- Stop it.

9
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,878
She's shy.

10
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,257
I could just see this
ending up on the Internet.

11
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,926
Well, fine, cover up. See if I care.

12
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,055
- I'm interested in other things.
- Like what?

13
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,435
Like you.

14
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,317
- Oh, man.
- That was close.

15
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:16,820
Do it really... I'm scared of it.

16
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,906
- It's only 30 minutes out.
- Shut up. I've never been.

17
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,658
You've never been to Coney Island?

18
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:22,283
Oh, how have you
never been to Coney Island?

19
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,078
I don't know, I just... I've never been.

20
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,038
Oh, that's... It's so much fun.
I'm taking you. We're going.

21
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,372
Oh, my God.
You're so excited about this.

22
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:28,581
- Yeah, I can't wait to...
- Give me this.

23
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,917
What are you doing? What?

24
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,752
Oh, all right.
Well, then from the neck up, okay?

25
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,420
That's the only way I consent to this.

26
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,004
Oh, please, Rob,
nobody's paying for that online.

27
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,966
You've never been to
Twelve-Chest-Hairs. com, have you?

28
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,135
- Okay. What else?
- What else, what?

29
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,346
Other than cotton candy
and Tilt-A-Whirls?

30
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,307
- What do you want to do today?
- If I answer that...

31
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,894
- All right, is this thing on?
- Look out!

32
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,020
Babe, it's not my camera.

33
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,771
I don't know if it's the on button
or the zoom button.

34
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,481
All right. Here, here, here. I think I got it.
Is this on?

35
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,192
Oh, perfect. And now we can have
a nice record of you getting run over.

36
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,819
Is that funny?

37
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,531
What time is everybody
starting to show up?

38
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,657
- It's getting late here.
- A couple hours.

39
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,617
- That's why we have to hurry.
- Where are we going?

40
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,872
We're going... We're just going
around the corner to the store!

41
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,206
I want you to go around
with your brother's camera

42
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,168
and get testimonials from everyone.

43
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,586
Why?
I mean, it's not like this is a wedding.

44
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,839
I know it's not a wedding.
I said like a wedding.

45
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,632
I can't get this.

46
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,177
I don't get... I mean,
I don't understand why I have to do it.

47
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,555
'Cause, I mean, I don't...
I don't even know how to work this...

48
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,182
- That's what I think is gonna happen.
- No, I'm not!

49
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,516
- You totally are. You...
- You have no clue!

50
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,853
Okay, well, let me ask you a question.

51
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,146
Can you see me through the viewfinder?

52
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,899
Yeah. Got you.

53
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,567
Good. Now can you see me trying
to carry these bags all by myself?

54
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:38,944
You're doing a great job.

55
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,404
Here, practise doing two things at once.

56
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,365
- That's good! That was good.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,492
I'm not lugging this thing around

58
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,617
- all night long.
- He is your brother.

59
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,826
This is important. Stop freaking out.

60
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,952
I understand that, Lily, but it's a shit job!

61
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,663
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is! I'm not doing it!

62
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,956
Jason, I have been planning this
for two weeks!

63
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,584
- All I want you to do is help me.
- Okay, babe, babe.

64
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,545
Okay. All right? I'll do it. It's fine.

65
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,255
I really pissed her off.

66
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,218
Babe, come on.
I was just kidding! Come on!

67
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,473
Hud? Hud, listen to me.
I got a job for you.

68
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,182
I already have got a job.

69
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,434
- I'm doing the sign, so...
- Yeah, no. I see that,

70
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,562
but this is more important than the sign.
You know how, like, at weddings,

71
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,980
people give testimonials
to the camera, right?

72
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,274
No.

73
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,444
All right. You're gonna take the camera
and just, you know, go around the party

74
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,322
and film people wishing Rob good luck.

75
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,447
I don't know, man.

76
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,865
- That's a lot of responsibility.
- This is important.

77
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,076
And then you have
to do it the whole night...

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,077
And Marlena's gonna be here.

79
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,204
- She is?
- Oh, yeah. She is.

80
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,538
- So you're gonna take that.
- Oh, hold on.

81
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,915
- And you're gonna talk to her...
- I didn't...

82
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,707
- For Rob.
- I didn't say I would do it.

83
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,918
- Just try it out.
- All right, I'll do a few.

84
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,127
You can, just do mine...

85
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,338
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go.

86
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,798
All right.

87
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,134
Rob, I don't even know what to say, bro.

88
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,345
Best of luck in Japan.
I love you so much,

89
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,680
and I'm proud of you.

90
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:52,350
- That's it.
- That's it?

91
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,605
- Yeah. Easy enough.
- Yeah. It's actually kind of fun.

92
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,983
- You enjoy it, Hud.
- Thanks, man.

93
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,151
Yeah, I'm doing...

94
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,696
Hey, what's up, man?

95
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,613
Hey, guys? Hey.

96
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:07,615
- What do we say?
- Anything.

97
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,120
Bon voyage, Rob.
Or however you say that in Japanese.

98
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:15,456
Yeah, good.
Oh, yeah, all right. Oh, yeah...

99
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,834
- Hud, what are you doing?
- I'm documenting the night.

100
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,670
But I thought I asked Jason to do that.

101
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:23,214
Oh, yeah, well, Jason asked me to do it,
so I've been doing it.

102
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,425
I've been doing it really well.

103
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,800
Well, are you gonna
take it seriously, though?

104
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,261
Because it's really important.

105
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,637
No, of course. I've been taking it
really, really seriously.

106
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,764
- Very seriously.
- You promise?

107
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,600
Yeah, you wanna do
your testimonial now?

108
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,269
- Okay.
- Yeah, do it right now.

109
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,394
Okay.

110
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:38,062
Okay, just open up to him,
'cause this is gonna be

111
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,274
- the last thing he sees you...
- Okay, Hud, I got it.

112
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,108
Robert Hawkins,

113
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:45,403
I can't believe you're leaving me
to look after your brother by myself.

114
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:49,490
Oh! Easy, easy. I mean
I'm obviously standing right here...

115
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,411
And I know we're not officially family,
yet, but...

116
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,204
- Not fair, 'cause I'm gonna...
- Dude.

117
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,456
- Okay.
- I'll cut him out later.

118
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,586
But I think of you as my brother,
and I hope you think of me as a sister.

119
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,048
So, you better call us.

120
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,718
Now that you have this job,
you can afford to call us, so...

121
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,721
- Hud?
- Yeah.

122
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:12,555
Yeah, sorry. No, you're good.
You're good. You're good.

123
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,682
- That was good!
- That's it?

124
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:14,807
I thought that was really, really good.

125
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,894
Yeah, but you weren't even paying
attention for...

126
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,074
Okay. Okay, you can do this.

127
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:35,329
Yeah. You got this, man. You got this.

128
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,002
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up, dude?

129
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,213
What's up?

130
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,136
Excuse me! Hey, Marlena?

131
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,180
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi. Hi.

132
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,932
Hey, did you know that I'm going around

133
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,600
the party and I'm...
Do you know Rob's leaving?

134
00:07:57,726 --> 00:07:59,978
- Like it's his going-away party.
- Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:05,358
Cool. Hey, so we're taping,
I think, people talking about him.

136
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:08,194
Oh, no, thank you.
I barely even know Rob.

137
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:10,656
I'm just coming to say hi to Lily,
so it's a little weird,

138
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,199
if I'm even on it, I think, but thanks.

139
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,160
Okay, cool,
except I'm supposed to get everybody.

140
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,163
So have you ever been to a wedding?

141
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,417
No, I get what you're doing. I just...
I don't want to do it, but thank you.

142
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,877
Okay, cool.
We'll just do a short one real quick.

143
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:32,094
Okay.

144
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,931
Hey, Rob, Marlena.

145
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,726
I think we've met, like,
probably three times before, total,

146
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,937
and every one of those times
I was really drunk,

147
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:46,024
so I don't really even know what to say.

148
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,985
But you have a cool job!
That's something!

149
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,320
- Like you're president of something!
- Vice president!

150
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,864
Also really cool.

151
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:55,033
So good luck with that
and we're gonna be here

152
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,453
keeping New York really safe
and fun for you when you come back.

153
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,413
- Cool, that was a really good one.
- Yeah?

154
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,166
Yeah, we can do
another one if you want.

155
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,001
Do you actually have,
like a card or something?

156
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,254
Well, my agency... We're leaving.
We're going on this stupid retreat

157
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,590
and they like all this video,

158
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,133
- like, bonding crap.
- Oh, yeah. I'm actually...

159
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,926
- I'm not a professional.
- What?

160
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,596
- I'm not a professional. I'm Hud.
- Hug?

161
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,140
No, no, no, Hud.
I'm Rob and Lily's friend.

162
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,561
- We met, like, several times before.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

163
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:24,687
Yeah, you have the camera
in front of your face,

164
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,523
- it's probably why I didn't...
- Okay, here. If I move it?

165
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,775
- Oh, yeah. What's going on? Totally.
- Yeah.

166
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,652
Yeah, cool. It's nice to see you again.

167
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,822
- Really good to see you. Really good.
- So what have you been up to?

168
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,116
I actually... I'm gonna just go
grab some food,

169
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,409
but good luck with the...

170
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,038
I could still do your
agency's retreat if you wanted...

171
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,999
He's coming up the stairs right now.
Everybody get ready. Get ready.

172
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,876
Can someone turn down
the music, please?

173
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,216
Surprise! Surprise!

174
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,514
No, no, no, no, no, no!

175
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,308
How did you guys plan all this?

176
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,812
Easy, you're naive. Let's go.

177
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,480
- Hey. How are you?
- Take this. Take this.

178
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:08,690
- I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you.
- What's up?

179
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,942
Oh, hey. Yes. Good.

180
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,318
- What's up, man?
- Speech!

181
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,530
- Yeah, speech! Speech!
- Speech! Speech!

182
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,327
- Oh, this is very surprising...
- I hope so.

183
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,080
- Obviously.
- It's a surprise party.

184
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,413
Yeah.

185
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,626
But it's very sweet. So thank you. Lily?

186
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,836
It was everyone. It was everyone.

187
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,298
No, thank you, everyone.
Thank you. It's...

188
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:37,219
Oh, it means a lot, so... That's it.
That's all I got. I don't know.

189
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,096
- Have a good time!
- Yeah, party!

190
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,389
Yeah!

191
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:46,854
- Hey, man. Were you surprised?
- Yo. I was, like, not even surprised.

192
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,772
No? Can you describe your current
emotions right now?

193
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,442
I don't know. I would say blasé.
Like, I'm a little... I'm just a little bored.

194
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,988
- No, you're not. Well, congrats.
- No, man, that was awesome, dude.

195
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,530
What are you doing
with the video camera

196
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,657
- by the way?
- I'm documenting the night

197
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,241
so that you can take it
to Japan with you.

198
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,409
Oh, can I watch it every night

199
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,535
- when I get there?
- Jason asked if I...

200
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,745
- Yeah, you could.
- Oh, good.

201
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,498
All right, thank you. Cool.

202
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,043
Hey, Hud, do you know
if Beth's coming tonight?

203
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,589
Yeah, I guess. I'm sure Lily invited her.
Why wouldn't she be here?

204
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,395
So how are you
gonna survive without Rob?

205
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,148
- He's like your main dude.
- Yeah, I know.

206
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,816
Hey, how am I gonna
survive without you?

207
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,527
- I don't know. I'm like your main dude.
- Straight up.

208
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:41,158
- As I make my... I'm not here.
- Hi, Hud.

209
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,368
I'm just documenting. Not here.

210
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,077
That was my biggest problem
is that she picked him...

211
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,873
You know what.
No, but when he said My Fair Lady...

212
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:50,875
- I love My Fair Lady.
- I was like, "Really?"

213
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,046
That was wonderful.
But, I mean, it worked out, right?

214
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:57,548
Beth, hey! You made it.

215
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,259
It doesn't matter, dude, you're here.
All is well.

216
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,427
Oh, no, it's good. It's good.

217
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,139
- Enjoy it. Have fun.
- Oh, I will. I'm just gonna go say...

218
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,600
- Who is that guy?
- I don't know. He's random.

219
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:09,227
Here, I'm gonna go check it out.
Look out, documenting.

220
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,437
Oh, thanks.

221
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,563
- I missed your surprise.
- Oh, that's okay.

222
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,816
I'm sorry. No, we had cab problems.
I'm really sorry.

223
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,485
- That's fine.
- Decorating's mine.

224
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:19,696
- No, that's fantastic.
- Rob, this is Travis.

225
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,947
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, pleasure.

226
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,365
I've heard a lot about you.

227
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,991
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Thank you.

228
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,534
- Vice President. That's fantastic.
- I love your dress.

229
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,953
- Thank you. I love yours.
- Yeah, thank you.

230
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,705
That's really amazing.

231
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,956
- Should we...
- Yeah, there's a buffet.

232
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,958
Hey, I'm documenting the night.
I'm Hud.

233
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,293
- Okay.
- So, there's tons of sake.

234
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,169
Yeah, just help yourselves, enjoy.

235
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,587
- Enjoy, everybody.
- It's good to meet you.

236
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,591
- Have a good one, yeah.
- Thanks for coming.

237
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,134
- I think he just said I was cute.
- Are they dating?

238
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,345
Yeah.

239
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,201
- Hey, is everything cool, man?
- Yeah, everything's cool.

240
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:10,580
Okay, because... I don't know,
because you been over here kind of...

241
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,749
Is that my camera?

242
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,293
I don't know. Your brother gave it to me.

243
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,628
Did you switch the tape?
Because I had a tape in there.

244
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,754
I don't know. Was...

245
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,423
Roller-coasters are fun, but, like,
any kind of tea-cuppy thing...

246
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,592
Tape was in here when I got it. Why?

247
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,179
- Rob, why?
- No, it doesn't matter.

248
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,224
It doesn't... It's stupid.

249
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,643
Okay, are you sure you're cool?
Because you're really weirding me out.

250
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,895
Like, we haven't been
hanging out or anything.

251
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,150
- Here. Here, man. Come on.
- All right, cool. That's more like it.

252
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,736
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

253
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,032
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey, Beth! Beth. Beth. Beth.

254
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,826
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

255
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:53,789
Oh, Hud, I don't know.
It's not a really good time right now.

256
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,000
Come on, he's leaving.

257
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,375
- I mean, can we...
- I know.

258
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,793
You're not gonna be able
to talk to him for a while.

259
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,254
Isn't there something you wanna say?

260
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:04,926
You know what?
Travis, can you get me a drink?

261
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,886
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course.
- Is that... Okay.

262
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,554
Cool, thanks.

263
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,892
Okay, let's... Right here? I don't...

264
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:13,518
- No, we can do it in the kitchen.
- Okay, perfect.

265
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,769
Okay.

266
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,813
Okay.

267
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,275
Rob,

268
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,114
I didn't want to do this on camera.

269
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,620
But, I just... I just want you to know
how happy I am for you,

270
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,415
because I know how hard
you've worked for this job

271
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,251
and I know how much it means
to you and...

272
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,756
And I'm really gonna miss you.

273
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,009
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

274
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,187
Jason? There's something totally weird
going on with Rob and Beth.

275
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,398
- What are you talking about?
- I'm serious. They're right outside.

276
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,149
- Hud! Not now.
- Okay. I'll check it out.

277
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,943
You never even called me, Rob!

278
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,570
You go and bring some guy to my party?

279
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,947
Hold on!
You haven't talked to me in weeks!

280
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:09,783
- Hud, man! Come on!
- Sorry!

281
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:12,159
- What? What?
- I got it. I got it. Hud, get back inside.

282
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:15,121
- But I'm documenting!
- Not this.

283
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,916
Lily, do you know what
they were fighting about?

284
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,835
Lily, if you know,
you have to tell me. Lily!

285
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,043
I'm not telling you.

286
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,754
I really should know,
as the guy documenting this.

287
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,923
She was the one
who brought me back inside.

288
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,008
- Okay, fine. We'll go find out.
- I'm positive. I promise.

289
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,969
- We'll ask her. We'll go find out.
- She's in the kitchen.

290
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:31,011
- What?
- Lil!

291
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,389
Lil, do you have something to tell us?

292
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,557
- No.
- You do, don't you?

293
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,725
- What? No.
- Hud, you're a genius.

294
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,977
- You're dodging the question right now.
- There is nothing to tell you.

295
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,104
- Nothing.
- Liar.

296
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:40,813
Lily, if you know something,
you have to tell us.

297
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,940
- No.
- Look at me.

298
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,192
- Lily.
- I know you. Babe.

299
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,486
Okay, fine, but not on camera.
I'm not telling you on camera.

300
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,864
Okay, that's not a problem.
All right, no problem.

301
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,490
Why would we say anything?

302
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,075
- We won't say anything.
- Rob and Beth slept together.

303
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,826
- Are you serious?
- It happened a few weeks ago.

304
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,412
Beth made me promise
not to say anything.

305
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,580
Are you kidding me, Lily?

306
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,248
Rob and Beth sleep together,
you're not gonna tell me?

307
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,668
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
- Why wouldn't I tell you?

308
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,753
Okay, you guys,
don't ask me where I heard this.

309
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,548
Rob and Beth totally had sex together.

310
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:08,424
- I knew it.
- Are you kidding me?

311
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,552
No, I'm not kidding.
This is extremely serious.

312
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,261
Hey, Marlena.

313
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,721
- It's me, Hud, from before.
- Hi. Right.

314
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,432
Did you know
that Rob and Beth had sex?

315
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,100
- No.
- Yeah, isn't that crazy?

316
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:19,269
- They've been friends forever.
- Crazy.

317
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:21,437
I mean, Rob's been in love
with her since college.

318
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:25,024
Well, maybe it was like
a going-away present, you know?

319
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,068
Yeah. Wait, were we supposed
to get presents?

320
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,821
- They did. They had sexual intercourse.
- What?

321
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,030
- Lily told me.
- No way.

322
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,198
- No, you are so...
- No, I promise.

323
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,365
Why do you make up stuff like that?

324
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,701
- No, I do not. I have a nice car.
- You make shit up.

325
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:36,702
I didn't say what kind...

326
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,953
Hey.

327
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,258
- Good luck in Japan, Rob.
- Good luck tonight, Travis.

328
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,264
Hey, dude. Dude, dude, dude.
Are you all right, man?

329
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,140
- Hey. Come on.
- This is not the time, Hud.

330
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,475
- What is it, man?
- Let him go.

331
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,394
- We should talk to him.
- We're not talking to him.

332
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,687
I could talk to him now.

333
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,396
Dude, you already talked
to the whole party!

334
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,857
- ... have to do something.
- No. Everyone needs to just calm down

335
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,067
- and give him space.
- He's just gonna stay

336
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,861
- locked in his room all night?
- Lily, look at you.

337
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,654
- It's fine, trust me.
- It is not fine.

338
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,365
- It is fine.
- You are his brother.

339
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,785
You are his best friend.
Go and make him happy.

340
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,453
So, how do you wanna do this?
Do you wanna do most of the talking,

341
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,997
or do you want me
to do most of the talking?

342
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,040
- You're not doing any talking.
- Okay, cool.

343
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,209
We got to talk.

344
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,335
You don't know
what you're talking about,

345
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,586
- all right?
- Okay, well, then tell me.

346
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,923
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

347
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,259
Yeah, well, Beth told Lori
that after you guys got together,

348
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,759
- you totally blew her off.
- I didn't blow her off!

349
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,927
She said you never called her.

350
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:37,430
Look, I'm leaving, all right?
So what am I supposed to do?

351
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,098
I don't know, man.
She was heartbroken.

352
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:42,602
Look, there's no "together. " It's just
her and me, two separate things.

353
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,811
It's better if we just stay friends.

354
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,605
...not that I feel like I'm not
good enough for her!

355
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,606
No, stop, stop!
I didn't say "feel," Rob.

356
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,317
You're not good enough for her.

357
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:52,278
That's it. That's fact. That's science.

358
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,990
Beth Mclntyre is, like,
from a whole 'nother planet, man.

359
00:17:56,116 --> 00:18:00,119
She's beautiful. She's charming.
And you... I love you,

360
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:02,454
but let's face it,
you're kind of a douchebag.

361
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:07,210
And going to Japan is not gonna fix that.
She's crazy about you, bro.

362
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,505
- Like, right now, as you are.
- And you're in love with her.

363
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,298
- But you got to go after her.
- It's not that simple.

364
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,634
- No, it is that simple, Rob.
- Come on, man. Don't be scared.

365
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,885
It's about moments, man.
That's all that...

366
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,263
You got to learn to say,
"Forget the world,"

367
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,891
and hang on to the people
that you care about the most.

368
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,980
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.
What the hell was that?

369
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,736
That scared the shit out of me.

370
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,404
Lil! Lil!

371
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,281
Did you feel that?
It was like an earthquake.

372
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:38,450
- You guys...
- Lil, where are you?

373
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,285
- What was that?
- What was that?

374
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:41,869
- Hey. Are you all right?
- Oh, my God.

375
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,288
- Yeah, that was really scary.
- Did you see anything?

376
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,082
Hey, Marlena! Marlena, are you okay?

377
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,334
Guys, look out!

378
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,461
- Okay.
- It was like a bomb.

379
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,630
All right, here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

380
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,798
Wait. Everyone quiet down. All right?

381
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,049
- But now, just approximately...
- Shut up, shut up.

382
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,635
- ... 15 minutes after word...
- Guys! Come on.

383
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,180
...of a possible earthquake
in lower Manhattan.

384
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:05,477
Nearby, in New York Harbour, we're
getting word of an oil tanker capsizing

385
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,064
in the middle of the harbour
near the Statue of Liberty.

386
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,606
- Once again...
- Dude, that's really close.

387
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,858
- ... there's no way to know if any...
- That's really, really close.

388
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,861
That's true. Do you think
we could see something from the roof?

389
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:17,446
- I don't know. Maybe.
- J, wanna go to the roof?

390
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,698
Let's go see if we can see
something on the roof.

391
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,990
Come on, Jason.
We're not going up to the roof.

392
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,202
- Yeah, let's go up there.
- I don't think we should.

393
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,538
- No!
- That was really...

394
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,334
What do you think?
Think it's another terrorist attack?

395
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:32,378
- It's insane, man.
- Watch your step.

396
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,347
It was shaking everywhere, man.
Just like tremors.

397
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,058
- Yeah, it's on the news downstairs.
- Is this the only lights that went out?

398
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,727
- I think they blew up the trains.
- No, a couple did.

399
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:52,147
- Some stayed on.
- Oh, man. What is going on?

400
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:54,317
Maybe you should've left town
a little bit earlier, right?

401
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:55,734
Shut up.

402
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:58,570
Oh, my God!

403
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,907
No, no, no.

404
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,911
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

405
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,500
Hud. Move. Hud!

406
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,851
Oh, God.

407
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,313
- Rob, you got a set of keys?
- Get out of here!

408
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,941
Right, did you look back?
Did anybody get hurt?

409
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,736
- Did anybody see Jason or not?
- I don't know.

410
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,864
Did anybody see Jason?
Has anybody seen Jason?

411
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,782
- Did anybody see Jason?
- Is he inside?

412
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,165
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, shit!

413
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,209
Oh, Jesus Christ!

414
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,630
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

415
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,342
Oh, my God!

416
00:21:12,645 --> 00:21:14,730
You gotta take your stuff
and we gotta get out of here, man!

417
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,023
I'm telling you!

418
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,983
- I'm so sorry.
- Where were you?

419
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,496
Hey, did you guys see that?
Did you guys just see that?

420
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,594
Go! Let's go!

421
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,477
- Hey, get down! Get down!
- You all right? You all right?

422
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,061
Yeah, did you guys see that?

423
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,565
- Did you guys see that?
- You all right?

424
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,403
There are people still out there.

425
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,375
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob, I saw it! Rob!

426
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,127
- Rob.
- What?

427
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,296
- Rob, I saw it!
- What?

428
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,464
- What's he saying?
- It's alive.

429
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,603
Stay down, Lily! Get back!

430
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,570
He's going away now.

431
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,030
- Jason, what are you doing?
- Jason, where are you going?

432
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,782
Lily, just wait.

433
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,119
- Jason, don't go out...
- Jason, don't!

434
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,538
Lily, just wait here!

435
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,707
Hey, Rob! Rob!
Where's he going, dude?

436
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,750
- Jason!
- Rob. Rob!

437
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:22,525
- Oh, my God. Marlena?
- Oh, God.

438
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,028
Are you okay?
Wait, come here. Come here. Sit down.

439
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,259
It walked right through
that street over there.

440
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,887
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It walked right over my head.

441
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:55,057
- What?
- That's the sound it's making.

442
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,352
You said you saw something, right?
So what did you see?

443
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,729
- You said it was alive? What was it?
- Who cares what it...

444
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,523
I don't know, man. I don't know.
I mean, I was taping. I can show you.

445
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,652
Hey, you guys! I have it on tape!

446
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,904
- Well, then rewind it. Rewind it.
- Yeah. Here, here. Let me rewind it...

447
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,323
It's gonna be a great opportunity for you.

448
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:11,950
Yeah, but I don't even
speak the language.

449
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,451
Oh, come on. How hard could it be?

450
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,412
It's Japanese. It's Japanese-hard.

451
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:21,375
- It'll be fine.
- Do you really think I should go?

452
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,419
- Oh, my God.
- That makes no sense.

453
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,130
- That makes no sense.
- Did you see it?

454
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,340
I don't know what it was, of course!
It was giant.

455
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,843
It was like... Did you see that thing?

456
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,971
- I'm not yelling at you, all right?
- Yes, you are!

457
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,972
Hey, guys, guys, come on!
Everybody just calm down!

458
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,517
- Quiet, guys.
- All right. Come on, just shut up!

459
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,310
All right? We don't know what we saw!
The point is it's still here!

460
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,689
All right? So we need to get
the hell out of Manhattan!

461
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,440
- Now.
- Yeah, yeah.

462
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,233
And out to the Brooklyn Bridge.
I think it's the best plan.

463
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,277
- It's a straight shot to Delancey.
- Just take the Williamsburg.

464
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,363
No. Do you know how far that is?
Brooklyn is right there.

465
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,949
No, no, no, dude. It's so much closer.
It's right here.

466
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,034
- Centre Street's like a block away.
- What's going on?

467
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,703
I think we're gonna get out of here.
Is she okay to...

468
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,498
Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay. Marlena,
we're gonna get out of here, okay?

469
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,542
It was eating people.
It was eating everyone.

470
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,380
We gotta go! Go! Let's go!

471
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,756
Okay, come here.

472
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,592
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- I don't think... Don't even look.

473
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,391
- Is anyone's phone working?
- What?

474
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:19,933
- Hud, is your phone working?
- What?

475
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:22,603
- No...
- Shit! I left it in the apartment.

476
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,230
- There's no signal.
- You're not getting a signal either?

477
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,647
No, no, come on.

478
00:25:25,773 --> 00:25:27,482
- Hud, come on!
- What? Okay.

479
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:39,287
It's all right.

480
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,704
Let's go.

481
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:41,830
We need an IV.

482
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,040
- Calm down, please.
- Let's go, people.

483
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,416
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Excuse me, Officer.

484
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,085
Do you know...
What was that thing? What was it?

485
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,753
Look, if you're not injured,
you got to keep moving, man.

486
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,714
Let's go! Let's go, people! Let's go!

487
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:53,175
Yeah, once we get to the bridge,
we'll be safe.

488
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,179
Hey, how are you? Is she doing better?

489
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,013
She's okay. She's gonna be fine.

490
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,349
- Marlena, you saw it. What was that?
- Not now, Hud.

491
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,644
Sorry.

492
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,277
Please go in an orderly manner.

493
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,154
Continue moving south
towards Brooklyn.

494
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,907
- Just keep going.
- Yeah, I don't know. It got hit.

495
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,037
Once we get over there,
I'll go to my cousin's house.

496
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,829
She has a condo. She's out of town.

497
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,172
I repeat, do not stop. Keep moving.

498
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,509
There will be instructions
on the Brooklyn side...

499
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:40,681
Get across the bridge.
Move in a quick and orderly fashion.

500
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,442
- You still filming?
- Yeah.

501
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,695
People are gonna wanna know
how it all went down.

502
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,449
Well, you can just tell them
how it all went down, Hud.

503
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,076
No, that wouldn't work.

504
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,663
People need to see this, you know?
This is gonna be important.

505
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,330
I mean, people are gonna watch this.

506
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:07,415
- Beth? Beth?
- Rob!

507
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:12,380
Beth, I've been trying to reach you.
Are you okay? Hello?

508
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:16,550
Wait a second, you guys!
Look, hey! Lily, stop!

509
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,761
I'm sorry. It's really loud here.
Can you speak up?

510
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,055
Lily!

511
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,558
- What?
- Rob got a hold of Beth.

512
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,560
Wait! Jason, wait!

513
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,729
- Rob's got Beth on the phone!
- What'd you say?

514
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,897
- What?
- Hey, y'all, come on.

515
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,607
Rob's got Beth on the phone!

516
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:35,528
Okay, Beth, you're gonna
have to calm down, okay?

517
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,905
Where are you?
What do you mean, you can't move?

518
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,784
- What?
- I repeat, no panicking.

519
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,250
Did you see it?

520
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:08,102
- Jason!
- Can you see anything?

521
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,644
No, I can't get over there!

522
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,939
I can't... I can't see anything!
Can you see it?

523
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,732
Jason!

524
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,902
- Why did you stop?
- Jason!

525
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,987
- What?
- Jason, watch out!

526
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:27,954
Jason! No, Jason! No!

527
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,375
Jason!

528
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,340
- No, no! God! No, Jason! Jason!
- Lily, come on!

529
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,967
Jason! No!

530
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,694
Go, go, go, go!

531
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:31,352
Lily. Lily, wait. Stop! Turn around
and listen to me right now.

532
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:33,479
Would somebody please,
please tell me what just happened?

533
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,356
- I don't know.
- I mean, it came out of nowhere!

534
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,067
And he was there
and then he was gone!

535
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:41,778
- My God! Jason! Jason!
- Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

536
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:45,199
Rob. You got to listen to me, man.
I am so sorry about your brother.

537
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:49,744
I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? Rob?

538
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,250
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

539
00:29:57,586 --> 00:30:00,548
- Rob. Rob, dude.
- We can't stay here.

540
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,925
- We can't.
- Rob. We got to get out of here, man.

541
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:07,221
Listen to me.
We got... We got to get moving, man.

542
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,847
We go to the Manhattan Bridge,
you know?

543
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,641
We got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

544
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,184
Okay, we can go to the other side.
We can try and get

545
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,396
to the Lincoln Tunnel.
I don't know, man. I don't know, but...

546
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,983
Dude, we got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

547
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:24,238
What are we gonna do, Rob?
What are we gonna do?

548
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,825
Do you know? Hey!

549
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:32,078
Look... Hey, Jesus. Rob. Hey, Rob?

550
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,080
- No.
- Rob!

551
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,166
- My battery's dead.
- Yeah, dude, I...

552
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,045
Well, listen, we got
to get out of here, man. You know?

553
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,337
- Rob! Rob!
- Well, where's he going?

554
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,922
Where are you going?

555
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,674
Oh, God. I'll go get him. Hey, Rob!

556
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,931
Rob! Dude!
I can't take all this running, man!

557
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:53,933
Hey, Rob.

558
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,395
Excuse me. Hey, Rob!
The store's closed, man!

559
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,773
- Rob, Rob!
- ... burning right now.

560
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,778
The bridge was filled
with pedestrians travelling across.

561
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,112
- It has collapsed.
- Holy shit.

562
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,198
No word on injuries yet, but...

563
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:10,617
Oh, God.

564
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:16,582
We continue now with our breaking
news story in lower Manhattan.

565
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:20,502
We are getting some truly extraordinary
live images here in the studio.

566
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,796
For those of you just joining us,

567
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,507
lower Manhattan is
in an absolute state of siege

568
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,217
in what has been...

569
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:34,767
This is a mandatory evacuation.

570
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,269
Proceed south immediately.

571
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,647
Get out of the city in an orderly fashion.

572
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:45,568
This is a mandatory evacuation!
We need everyone out of this area now!

573
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,987
Rob? Rob! Hey, dude!

574
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,198
Actually, I think we need to get out
of here, like, right now!

575
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,490
Do you know what I'm saying?
Because there's some

576
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,993
serious shit going on outside! Rob?
No, like, you know what I mean?

577
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,997
Rob, like, there's some strange
shit going on! Rob?

578
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,625
Donna Martel is near the scene
at City Hall.

579
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,917
What's going on?

580
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:02,961
Can you tell us what it looks like
on the ground there?

581
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,298
Well, Bob, the military will not
let us get too close,

582
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:09,844
but from what we can see,
there's clearly a sizable mobilisation

583
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,178
of troops and equipment,

584
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,180
and they're trying to get everyone
to leave the area...

585
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,348
To be honest, Tom, your guess
is as good as mine at this point.

586
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,726
There appears to be
something coming off of it.

587
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,019
And the ground seems
to be covered in debris...

588
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,730
It looks like there's something
falling of it, doesn't it?

589
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,566
Yes. Yes. Yes, it does.

590
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,942
There are pieces falling
all over the street.

591
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,819
- Oh, my God.
- Whatever they are, they are moving.

592
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:28,945
- Oh, my God! They're...
- Donna!

593
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:30,155
- They're right there!
- Oh, shit.

594
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,157
- Donna, can you hear us?
- Hey!

595
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,326
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here! Where is he?

596
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,493
I know, that's what I've been telling him.

597
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,703
- Rob! Rob!
- I've been trying to do that!

598
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,538
Rob. Rob. We gotta go right now, okay?

599
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,375
- The military's evacuating everyone.
- Hey, Rob, listen to me, okay?

600
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,585
We gotta get out of here.

601
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,086
- It's time to leave the electronics store.
- Rob, come on. We got to go.

602
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,463
- Just come on. Let's go...
- Just stop it!

603
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,089
Okay? Stop, wait!

604
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,218
To listen to your messages...

605
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:59,351
Rob! Rob! I can't...
Oh, God! I can't move.

606
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:04,690
It fell. My apartment...
The whole wall fell on me!

607
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:10,069
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding. I can't move.

608
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,155
Oh, my God.

609
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,661
Help me, Rob.

610
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,122
To delete this message...

611
00:33:33,802 --> 00:33:35,221
Rob, wait up! Rob!

612
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,847
I got your message,
and I'm on my way there, okay?

613
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,433
Hey, Rob, listen.
You got to think this through, man.

614
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,895
Okay? Beth lives in Midtown.
Midtown is that way.

615
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,230
- Guess what else is that way?
- Will you wait up?

616
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,691
- Some horrific shit is in Midtown!
- This is insane, okay?

617
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,652
We're not gonna go
near that thing, okay?

618
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,528
We're not gonna go
to the middle of the city!

619
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,279
No, we're not.
You're not coming with me.

620
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,156
Look. Fall in with the military.
Fall in with the crowd.

621
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,616
Let them gonna escort you out of here.

622
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,785
Okay?

623
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,119
- Rob!
- I'm sorry. I got to go.

624
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,747
Rob!

625
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,958
- Rob! Listen!
- Rob, wait a minute!

626
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,667
One of us is gonna have to tackle you,

627
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:08,295
and that's gonna be very uncomfortable
for everybody involved!

628
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,755
Listen, you can't talk me out of it, okay?

629
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,384
Look at me. This is not me crazy.
All right? I know what I'm doing.

630
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:14,510
And you can't talk me out of it.

631
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,137
- So turn around, go...
- I'm coming.

632
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,639
I'm coming with you.

633
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:21,766
Lily, you don't have to do that.

634
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,978
- No, I want to. I'm coming.
- Guys, did you not hear her message?

635
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,813
I mean, even if we get to Beth's,
there's a chance

636
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,773
- that she's already...
- Shut up.

637
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:34,989
Guys, this is insane.

638
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,657
- Rob!
- You know what I'm talking about, right?

639
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,992
You can't possibly think
that this is a good idea.

640
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,202
Rob! Rob!

641
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,288
- Rob!
- Hey... Hold...

642
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,916
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.

643
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,878
Yeah, but I don't understand you.
Rob, hold up!

644
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,005
Look, I'm sorry. Hey, listen to me. Man.

645
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,632
- Hud!
- I'm so sorry.

646
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,259
Hey, Rob! Wait up, please!

647
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:57,344
Rob! Have you tried maybe calling 911,

648
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,179
- see if somebody else can get there?
- Yeah, I tried!

649
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,599
Okay, well. I mean, what about police?
Fire department?

650
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,809
- I couldn't get through! I tried, I...
- Okay, it just seems a little...

651
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,231
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God!

652
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,679
Oh! Oh, my God.

653
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,478
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

654
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:53,192
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob!

655
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,036
- Hud! We're gonna go this way!
- I can't hear you!

656
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,914
- Subway!
- What? What?

657
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,833
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Come on! Come on!

658
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,210
This shit is crazy, dude!

659
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,387
Oh, Rob, dude. There's like...

660
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,478
Hud! Hud!

661
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:31,521
Are you okay, man? You all right?

662
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,981
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.
- Come on.

663
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,568
- Okay. Okay. Oh, God damn.
- Oh, shit.

664
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,452
What the hell was that?

665
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:52,166
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Did you see that?

666
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,003
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.
- Did you see that?

667
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,731
Okay.

668
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,778
Hey, look. We can just cross...
We can just cross to the other platform,

669
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,864
then go up the stairs and see
if the other side of the street...

670
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,159
Rob, the other side of the street
looks the same as this side!

671
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,202
We can wait for there to be a lull,
and then make a break for it!

672
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,204
Rob, the air caught on fire! Okay?
There's not gonna be a lull!

673
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,581
But if we wait on the other...

674
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:33,416
Listen to me, man,
I am with you, okay? I really, really am.

675
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:37,003
I'm just saying, you gotta listen
to what's going on up there.

676
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:40,007
- We can't...
- Rob, he's right, okay?

677
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,509
We have to wait. We have to wait.

678
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,014
This is insane.

679
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,186
Shit!

680
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:15,125
- Oh, God.
- What? Rob, what?

681
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,755
Hey, Mom.

682
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,927
Yeah, no. I'm okay. Okay, yeah, we are.

683
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,762
We're being evacuated right now.
The army's here.

684
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,974
We're being evacuated, so don't worry.
Okay, but Mom... Mom, listen.

685
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:39,023
We tried to get out of the city,
and we took the Brooklyn Bridge,

686
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:42,318
and we were right there when it hit.

687
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:48,074
Jason's dead. Jason's dead, Mom.

688
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,592
I don't know what to say to him.

689
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,387
You know?

690
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:56,434
Like, I feel like I should say something,

691
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,771
but I don't know what to say.

692
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:20,500
I'm not even supposed to be here.

693
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,713
You didn't have to be. I mean,

694
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:29,800
you had your chance in the alley.

695
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:32,179
You could've left us.

696
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:39,393
Yeah, you were supposed to meet up
with some friends or something, right?

697
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,813
Yeah.

698
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,108
I'm sorry.

699
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,155
- This isn't a bad idea.
- Just walk.

700
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,532
- Wait, so then...
- What's going on?

701
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,076
I don't know.

702
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,583
- ... just go across here.
- That's good.

703
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,585
Yeah. This is the six.

704
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,338
Rob, I don't think the trains
are running right now, man.

705
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,507
- No, we can just walk the track, see?
- Yeah.

706
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,092
Look. Beth lives here, Columbus Circle.

707
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:12,844
We can just walk down the six
to Lexington and then walk down

708
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,931
- Central Park South.
- You want us to walk in the tunnels?

709
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:18,266
It's either that or stay here.

710
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:22,186
I'll walk the tunnels.

711
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,572
I can't see.

712
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,952
- It's kind of freaking me out, you know?
- I think there's a light on the camera.

713
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,577
- Let me see.
- There is?

714
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,039
Yeah, right here. See?

715
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:47,461
Okay.

716
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,143
Ocean is big, dude.

717
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,021
All I'm saying is a couple of years ago,

718
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,148
they found a fish in Madagascar
that they thought

719
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:08,233
- had been extinct for centuries.
- So what?

720
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,235
It's been down there this whole time,
and nobody noticed?

721
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:13,405
Sure. Maybe it erupted
from an ocean trench, you know?

722
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,949
Or a crevasse. Crevice.
It's just a theory.

723
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,036
I mean, for all we know,
it's from another planet and it flew here.

724
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,748
- Like Superman?
- Yeah, exactly like...

725
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,000
Wait. You know who Superman is?

726
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:28,711
Oh, my God.
You know who Superman is?

727
00:42:28,795 --> 00:42:31,422
- Okay, I'm not...
- I'm, like, feeling something.

728
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,507
- Are you aware of Garfield?
- A lot of people think

729
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,177
he's from a planet
that he's not actually from.

730
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,637
I just can't stop thinking about how
the last thing I said to her was,

731
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,847
"Good luck tonight, Travis. "

732
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,684
She knows you didn't mean that.

733
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,648
When I think of some of the things
I said to Jason...

734
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,900
- No, that's different.
- Why?

735
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,030
Jason knew you loved him.

736
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,960
Hey, do you guys remember
a couple of years ago, when that guy

737
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,172
was lighting homeless people
on fire in the subways?

738
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,757
- Jesus, Hud.
- What?

739
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,635
It's maybe not the best topic
for conversation down here.

740
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,885
Right.

741
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,726
I just can't stop thinking how scary
it would be if a flaming homeless guy

742
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,018
- came out of the dark right now.
- Hud, seriously.

743
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,188
- Seriously.
- I'm just saying. Sorry.

744
00:43:31,983 --> 00:43:35,237
- What was that?
- Let's just keep moving.

745
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,490
Holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.

746
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,579
This is disgusting.

747
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,498
They're all running
in the same direction.

748
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,460
- Yeah, like they're running away.
- From what?

749
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,052
Hey, how much farther?

750
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,972
I don't know.
Let's get out at the next station.

751
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,472
- Okay?
- Yeah.

752
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:06,601
Did you guys hear that?

753
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,603
- What is that?
- Just listen.

754
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,317
I don't see anything. Do you guys?

755
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,489
- Oh, man, this is the worst.
- Will you be quiet for five seconds?

756
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,909
- Oh, turn on the night vision.
- What?

757
00:44:23,034 --> 00:44:24,327
- What do you mean?
- It's right here.

758
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,079
I got it. It's right here. There.

759
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,501
Is it on?

760
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,003
- Oh, shit.
- What? What?

761
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,172
- Run. Okay, run. Okay, run.
- What?

762
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,842
Hey, let's start running! Just run!
Just run! Just start running right now!

763
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:43,429
Start running now! Run, run, run! Run!
Just run!

764
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,347
- Lily!
- You guys!

765
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,353
Wait.

766
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,443
Oh, God! Help!
Please help! You guys, help!

767
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,625
Marlena! Here!

768
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,628
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

769
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,425
Hud!

770
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,728
- ... there you go.
- Totally not what I was thinking...

771
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,744
How are you doing over there, Marlena?

772
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,329
You okay?

773
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,416
You tell me.

774
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:56,920
How does it look?

775
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,672
Looks like it hurts.

776
00:46:00,173 --> 00:46:03,092
What do you mean? You're saying
this isn't attractive, like, at all?

777
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,177
A little bit.

778
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:16,188
- Here. Here, here. You can wash it off.
- Thanks.

779
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,442
Here. Did it get you, Hud?
Did it bite you, man?

780
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,193
No, it didn't get me.

781
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,612
Okay. Okay.

782
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,452
Hey. Hey.

783
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,121
So those things
came out of nowhere, right?

784
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,164
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

785
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,711
That one that grabbed me,
it was trying to drag me away.

786
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,297
What's up with that?

787
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,552
- Maybe it liked you, Hud.
- Yeah.

788
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,847
Maybe it was trying
to make me its queen.

789
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:58,815
Hey, thanks for coming back
and helping me out, you know?

790
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,737
What? You think that I'm the kind
of person that wouldn't do that?

791
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:07,407
No. No. I know you aren't.

792
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:12,704
I was just saying, like, I'm glad you did.

793
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:19,878
Otherwise,
I would have been totally dead.

794
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,005
Right?

795
00:47:22,547 --> 00:47:24,715
It's okay. You just got bit.

796
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,177
Hey.

797
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:31,556
Marlena's hurt pretty bad, you know?

798
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:33,932
Well, we could wait here
for a little bit, I guess,

799
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,101
and just hope those things
don't make it through the door.

800
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,103
- Yeah, okay. What's the next option?
- Well.

801
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,940
Okay, we could see
what's out through this way.

802
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:44,110
- Maybe find another tunnel.
- No, no more tunnels.

803
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,197
Then, I don't know.
We try our luck up top.

804
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,869
Okay, just to be clear,
so our options are

805
00:47:52,952 --> 00:47:57,539
die here, die in the tunnels,
or die in the streets. Is that...

806
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,793
- Yeah, pretty much.
- ... pretty much the summing up of it?

807
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,378
But wait, we don't even know
where we are, right?

808
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:05,632
So, let's just go up and look around.
See if we recognise anything.

809
00:48:07,425 --> 00:48:09,135
Do you think you'll be okay to walk?

810
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,719
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Here, I'll help you.

811
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,744
- We're at 59th.
- We're at 59th.

812
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,579
- Yeah.
- We're at 59th.

813
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,010
That's weird.

814
00:48:53,012 --> 00:48:54,139
What?

815
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,311
Yeah.

816
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,534
Hello!

817
00:49:33,219 --> 00:49:34,596
Marlena?

818
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:37,056
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

819
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,268
I'm really... I'm dizzy.

820
00:49:40,393 --> 00:49:43,103
Yeah. Do you wanna
sit down for a second?

821
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,318
- No, I'm fine.
- She needs a doctor.

822
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,485
- You sure?
- I'm totally fine.

823
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,987
You know, 'cause we could
sit down if you want to.

824
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,112
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

825
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,699
We've got civilians!
Are there any more of you?

826
00:49:54,782 --> 00:49:56,117
- No, just us four.
- It's just us.

827
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:57,744
We got four civilians here.

828
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,163
- Okay, bring them in.
- Roger.

829
00:50:00,246 --> 00:50:02,539
- Let's go, move. Move it.
- Okay, okay.

830
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,878
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay.

831
00:50:09,547 --> 00:50:12,634
Excuse me, sir? Sir? Excuse me.

832
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,260
Listen, we need your help.
Our friend, she's hurt. She's trapped

833
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,887
in her building right by here,
at Columbus Circle.

834
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,347
That is not
where you wanna be right now.

835
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:20,849
Do you guys know what it is? Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

836
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:24,394
If they know, they ain't telling me.
Whatever it is, it's winning.

837
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,280
- What's up?
- We got another bite here.

838
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,159
Don't look at that. Gross.

839
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,914
- Please, we can't stay here. We have...
- Hey, not now.

840
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,456
- Copy that.
- Sir, we have two F-18s

841
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,166
on route from Selfridge.
Four more are arming up,

842
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,753
- maybe 30 minutes out.
- Roger that.

843
00:50:48,836 --> 00:50:51,797
Listen up, people.
Rack them and pack them.

844
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,050
- We're phantoms in 15.
- Sir.

845
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,052
- Where the hell did you find them?
- They were in the tunnels.

846
00:50:56,135 --> 00:50:58,179
Yeah, we had to walk all the way
from Spring Street.

847
00:50:58,304 --> 00:51:00,597
Get them ready for transport,
put them on the evac chopper.

848
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,724
- Yes, sir. Let's move. Move, move.
- No, wait. Wait.

849
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,059
- Listen, our friend is very badly hurt.
- Move it.

850
00:51:04,143 --> 00:51:05,186
- Move. Move.
- We have to get to her.

851
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:06,563
Sorry, son, can't help you.
Get them on the chopper.

852
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,148
No, but, please, listen to me. Let go!
Just listen for a second, please!

853
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,817
Turn that goddamned camera...

854
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,320
- We've been trying to get to her all...
- Make our own way.

855
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,990
- No, do you have a...
- I am not jeopardising this operation,

856
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,409
- or my men.
- I don't want your help.

857
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:20,952
You are getting on that chopper now.

858
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,411
I just need you to listen to me
for one second, sir.

859
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,621
- You have no idea what's out there.
- I don't care what's out there.

860
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,748
Listen to me. She's dying.

861
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,958
There is nothing I can do
about that now.

862
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:29,460
The girl that I love more than anything
is dying and it's my fault.

863
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:32,255
She should have been with me tonight,
and I let her go and...

864
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:34,298
And I get it, okay?
You have your hands full. I get that.

865
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,260
I get that, but we're gonna go after her,
and if you wanna stop me,

866
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,721
- then you're gonna have to shoot me.
- Hud.

867
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,307
- I don't feel so good.
- Oh, shit.

868
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:46,351
- Bite! We've got a bite!
- Marlena.

869
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,603
- Hold on a second.
- Get her moving.

870
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:48,771
Keep moving!

871
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,981
Hey, Marlena, are you okay?
Hey, what are you guys doing?

872
00:51:51,065 --> 00:51:52,983
Hold on a second.
Where are you taking her?

873
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,818
Hold on a second. Wait!
Oh my God, wait!

874
00:51:54,902 --> 00:51:56,945
- Marlena, stop! Just wait a second!
- Let me go.

875
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,322
- Just wait a second. Please.
- Let me go.

876
00:51:58,407 --> 00:51:59,949
- Wait! Marlena!
- Get out of the way.

877
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,784
Marlena! Hold on a second!

878
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,202
- Just wait a... Let go of me! Stop it!
- No.

879
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,418
God! Please, God!
Where are you taking Marlena?

880
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,753
Wait a second.

881
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:22,262
It's over. There is nothing you can do.

882
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:26,516
There is nothing you can do
for her now. It is over. It's over.

883
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,063
- Rogers, clear out of here.
- You sure?

884
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,190
I'll get them to the choppers from here.

885
00:52:32,273 --> 00:52:34,858
- Let's move out.
- Oh, my God.

886
00:52:36,277 --> 00:52:37,737
What just happened?

887
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:42,157
Let's go. I shouldn't be doing this shit.

888
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,327
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

889
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:47,496
- Let's go. Move.
- Okay, okay.

890
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,039
Let's go, move. Come on.

891
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,088
You gotta listen to me.

892
00:52:55,713 --> 00:52:58,340
This girl, her building,
it's at Columbus Circle?

893
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,260
- Yeah?
- If you wanna go out in this,

894
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,637
I ain't gonna stop you.
But you gotta know something.

895
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,056
The government's considering
the Hammer Down protocol,

896
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,016
which means they're willing
to let this whole area go.

897
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,728
- You mean Midtown?
- No, I mean Manhattan.

898
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:13,815
Come on. We're taking
one last shot at this thing.

899
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,940
- Oh, God.
- If that doesn't work,

900
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,777
they're levelling
the whole goddamned city.

901
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,028
- Your watch is still working?
- Yeah?

902
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,739
All right. The airlifts are leaving
from 40th and Park.

903
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,576
Last chopper's wheels-up
at exactly 0600.

904
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,413
If you can make it there,
then they'll get you out.

905
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:31,206
- Okay. Okay, thank you.
-58th Street's right there.

906
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,083
- Now, go. Move, move, move.
- Let's go.

907
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,293
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

908
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:39,757
- This is like a nightmare, you know.
- It all happened so fast,

909
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,800
I couldn't even really see
what happened to her.

910
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,846
I mean, did you see it?
Could you see what happened, Hud?

911
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,764
No, her eyes started bleeding, and then
they were screaming she was bitten.

912
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,184
And then she wouldn't stop bleeding.
And then...

913
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,813
Hud.

914
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:01,362
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

915
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,909
Look, guys, I don't mean to be...
But we don't have a lot of time.

916
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:11,038
Okay, so maybe you guys
should just stay here, and I'll go.

917
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,456
All right?

918
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:17,128
- I'm sorry. I just...
- No, no, we're coming. We're coming.

919
00:54:17,211 --> 00:54:18,378
Are you sure?

920
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,047
No, no, man.
No, we have to do this, okay?

921
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,634
We're with you. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go right now.

922
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:39,442
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What?

923
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:41,985
- Oh, my God.
- What is it? What?

924
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,822
- Shit.
- That's not Beth's place, is it?

925
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,867
- Oh, my God.
- Is that Beth's apartment?

926
00:54:47,992 --> 00:54:51,369
- Oh, my God.
- Rob. Is that her place?

927
00:54:51,996 --> 00:54:54,706
- Tell me that's not her place.
- That's her place, yeah.

928
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,753
Oh, shit. I don't suppose
she lives on the ground floor.

929
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,005
No, 39th.

930
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:02,798
- Oh, great.
- How do we even get up there?

931
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:06,885
I don't know. We just go inside
and then see how high we can get.

932
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,806
I don't know if I can do that.

933
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,893
Well, maybe we could try going up
the other building,

934
00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:16,728
and then see if there's a place
to cross over onto her roof.

935
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:20,023
And then we could find some way
down to her place.

936
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,527
Wait. No, never mind.
No, that's a bad idea.

937
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,153
Hey, that's a bad idea. I take that back.

938
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:30,827
No one ever listens to me, ever.
And now, of course, they listen to me.

939
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,036
Great.

940
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,541
Shit. Shit.

941
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:38,708
Probably not working.

942
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,168
- What's going on?
- Not working.

943
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,588
Wait, wait. Let's just... Maybe...

944
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,675
- No? No?
- Shit.

945
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,385
Well, why don't you take the stairs?

946
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,682
You guys see that guy's face
when Lily asked him what it was?

947
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:55,934
I mean, they have no idea.

948
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,858
- Unless they're, like, in on it.
- Jesus, Hud.

949
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,317
I don't read the papers.

950
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,068
- Maybe our government made this thing.
- Oh, yeah.

951
00:56:05,152 --> 00:56:06,862
I mean, you know,
maybe it was an accident,

952
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,280
- or maybe it was on purpose...
- Sure, maybe they did.

953
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,240
- Does it really matter right now?
- Yeah.

954
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,161
It matters because I need to talk
about something.

955
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:17,956
Otherwise, I'm actually probably
going to shit my pants in this stairwell.

956
00:56:22,795 --> 00:56:23,838
I'm sorry.

957
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,092
Hey, wait, wait. You guys hear that?
You guys hear that?

958
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:31,846
- Yes.
- Yeah.

959
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,347
Yeah, I think we're getting close.

960
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:37,768
Hud, I'm gonna check this floor.

961
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:38,978
Okay.

962
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:49,070
Okay, like, I think it's like,
two more up, I think.

963
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,197
Okay.

964
00:56:51,365 --> 00:56:52,657
Guys, guys, guys.

965
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,869
This one, it's got to be.
It's got to be this one.

966
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,012
Oh, God.

967
00:57:18,976 --> 00:57:22,521
I don't think there's anybody here. No.

968
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,400
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

969
00:57:30,237 --> 00:57:32,864
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

970
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,909
Okay, now, we can do this.
We can totally do this.

971
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,494
- I don't know, Rob.
- Look, it's a straight shot.

972
00:57:36,577 --> 00:57:38,913
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
- Lily, Lily, it's a straight shot.

973
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,164
Look, it's a straight shot.
We could use... There's pipes there.

974
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:44,376
We could use
the air conditioners. Okay?

975
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,003
Come on. We came this far.
We can do it. I'll go first.

976
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,130
- Okay, okay, okay. Yes.
- All right? Okay.

977
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:52,217
- Okay, I'll document it.
- Be careful, okay?

978
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,347
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

979
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:03,228
Okay. Hud, come on!
Put the camera down! Come on!

980
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,813
Oh, Jesus.

981
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,233
- Okay. All right. Okay.
- I'll go first.

982
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,945
All right. If this is the last thing you see,
that means I died.

983
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:13,572
- Hud, come on!
- Okay.

984
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,211
Look out! Oh, shit...

985
00:58:29,588 --> 00:58:30,588
Okay.

986
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,260
- Okay. Okay.
- Shit.

987
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,268
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, God.

988
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:57,157
- Yes. Okay. You all right?
- Yeah.

989
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,326
We're almost there, come on.

990
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,289
Come on, Hud.

991
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:07,793
Shit.

992
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:13,340
Beth! Beth! Beth!

993
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,811
- Can you get it?
- Do you need help?

994
00:59:27,813 --> 00:59:29,815
Do you need help? Or...

995
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,157
Beth? Beth?

996
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,702
Beth?

997
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:48,291
Beth? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

998
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,835
- What?
- Shit.

999
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:54,172
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Beth.

1000
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,512
- Beth.
- What?

1001
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,679
Beth!

1002
01:00:01,847 --> 01:00:03,849
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1003
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,693
Can you hear me? Beth.

1004
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,461
Hey.

1005
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,052
- Are you really here?
- Yeah, I'm really here.

1006
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:42,929
Rob?

1007
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,891
You came back for me.

1008
01:00:47,768 --> 01:00:50,061
Of course I came back for you.

1009
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:56,110
- I'm sorry it took me so long.
- No, it's okay.

1010
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,699
Okay, okay, okay. You're okay.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

1011
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,369
We'll get you out, all right?
Hud, put the camera down

1012
01:01:05,452 --> 01:01:07,246
- and help me, okay?
- Okay, okay.

1013
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,706
- It'll be okay.
- Okay, here we go.

1014
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,208
- If we all just lift at the same time.
- Hold on, okay. We got you.

1015
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,043
- All right? We have to.
- Don't do that, Rob.

1016
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,753
- Please don't do that.
- It's gonna be over in a second.

1017
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:16,922
- All right?
- Okay. Ready, guys?

1018
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,215
- No, please. No.
- Slowly. It's okay.

1019
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,717
We're gonna do it real slow.

1020
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,467
- Easy, easy, just wait.
- No, don't.

1021
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,929
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1022
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:28,934
Oh, God.

1023
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:35,733
- Okay, now, sit down. Sit down.

You're gonna be okay.

1025
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,199
- You're gonna be fine.
- No, no, no.

1026
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,784
I know, I know, I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.

1027
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,664
What is that?

1028
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:52,750
- God.
- It's a terrible thing.

1029
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:54,626

You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

1034
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,304
Just hold on to me.
You're gonna be all right.

1035
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:10,059
You're gonna be okay, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

1036
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:17,190
- Okay. Hang on to me.
- Oh, my God.

1037
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:19,693
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God.

1038
01:02:21,528 --> 01:02:22,655
Okay.

1039
01:02:23,155 --> 01:02:26,492
Oh, shit. Man, this is unbelievable.

1040
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:31,288
- Are you okay?
- Just don't look down, okay?

1041
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,539
- I can't help it.
- You're all right. You're all right.

1042
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,875
Oh, my God.

1043
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,005
Oh, God!

1044
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,507
- Okay, let's go.
- Keep moving, just go.

1045
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,717
Go, just go. Just go, go, go. Go.
Just get to the other side.

1046
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,844
Come on, just keep moving.

1047
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:50,181
Oh, my God.

1048
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,811
- Oh, shit!

1049
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,398

Oh, my God.

1055
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,311
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

1056
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,730
Something else also terrible.

1057
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:39,898
Rob, what time
do the choppers take off?

1058
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,858

1061
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:27,945
Wait up!

1062
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,956
- Did we make it?

Come on! Come on!

Wait for us. Wait for us.
We'll be right behind you.

1072
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:21,250
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!

1073
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,385
Stay low. Stay low.
Come on, come on, come on.

1074
01:05:32,177 --> 01:05:33,219
Thank you.

1075
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:38,891
- They're starting the bomb run.
- Get them out of here. Get going.

1076
01:05:49,027 --> 01:05:51,112
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

1077
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:56,159
Oh, my God.
Are you guys seeing this right now?

1078
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,369
Are you seeing this right now?
Look, look, look.

1079
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:04,041
Are you seeing this shit right now?
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1080
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:12,717
Oh, God.
Those aren't gonna hit us, are they?

1081
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,637
Oh, my God. They hit it!
They just hit it right now!

1082
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:20,224
Look, you guys, they just hit it!
They hit it with... Oh, my God!

1083
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:23,896
- Yeah, they hit it, you guys! They hit it!
- Oh, he's going down.

1084
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,023
Target down. Target down.
Target down. He's down.

1085
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,942
I think they got him.

1086
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,527
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's the shit right there!

1087

01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,786
Oh, my God. Oh my God.

01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:43,956
Please, God. Please.
Please, God and Jesus.

1090
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,708
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

1091
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,336
I'm so sorry, God. Please, no.

1092
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,297
Help me, Rob!

1093
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:53,759
Rob. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1094
01:07:19,117 --> 01:07:21,954
This is Hawkeye 6. Target still active.

1095
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,956
Initiating Hammer Down.
TOT, 15 minutes.

1096
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,291
Sirens will sound two minutes out.

1097
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,170
If you can hear those sirens,
you're in the blasting zone.

1098
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:36,510
Come on. Come on. Hud.
Hud, are you okay?

1099
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:41,222
- Yeah, all right. I guess. I think so.
- I can't move my arm.

1100
01:07:41,306 --> 01:07:43,641
- This is Duncan-Charlie, return to base.
- Help me, you got to help me.

1101
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,561
- God help us.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

1102
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,311
Come on, help me.

1103
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,693
I know, I know. We're gonna
get you out of here. Come on.

1104
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:53,985
Hud, come over to the other side.

1105
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,862
You've got to pull him up.
Come on, come on.

1106
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,989
- Okay, okay.
- I don't think I can move.

1107
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,615
Yes, you can. Don't say that.

1108
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:00,992
Copy your last, we're on the move.

1109
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,744
- Here, take his hand. Take his hand.
- Good luck.

1110
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,496
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I got it.
Come on, come on.

1111
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:11,253
I got his legs, go!

1112
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:19,595
- My leg!
- I know. I know, I know. I know.

1113
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,014
It's okay, you're fine. You're good.
You're okay. You're okay.

1114
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:23,515
I'm gonna have to stop the bleeding,
okay? Okay?

1115
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,975
I'm not okay.
I'm not gonna be able to walk.

1116
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,519
You are going to be able to walk.

1117
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,024
Don't do it.

1118
01:08:33,775 --> 01:08:35,694
Okay. All right, listen,
we got to get out of here, okay?

1119
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,903
Well, which way do we go?

1120
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,155
We have to get away from here,
because I think it's gonna explode.

1121
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:42,074
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- All right? Come on. Let's go.

1122
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:44,661
Let's go this way. Come on.
Come on, you can walk. Okay.

1123
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:46,954
Come on. Hold on, wait a second.

1124
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,122
- Hud!
- Hud!

1125
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:51,292
What? Oh! Oh, no!

1126
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,380
Hud! Hud!

1127
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:05,724

01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:26,994
Hud!

1129
01:09:29,414 --> 01:09:30,498
Hud!

1130
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:33,752
Hud!

1131
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:37,005
Hud! Hud!

1132
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,007
Hud! Hud!

1133
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,677
Hud! Hud!

1134
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:44,930
Hud!

1135
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,970
He's gone.

1136
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,141
He's gone.

1137
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,395
- They're all gone.
- I know.

1138
01:10:39,025 --> 01:10:43,947
We gotta go. We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

1139
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:47,117
Where? There's nowhere to go to.

1140
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,453
We got to go. He's coming towards us.

1141
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:52,581
No, we should just wait here.
Just wait here.

1142
01:10:52,664 --> 01:10:55,375
Listen, we wait here,
they'll find us, all right?

1143
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,170
They're fighting him right now.
If we wait here, they'll find us.

1144
01:10:58,253 --> 01:11:00,337
No, we can't stay.

1145
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,761
It's okay. It's okay.

1146
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:13,018
- I'm so scared.
- I know. I know. I know.

1147
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,006
My name is Robert Hawkins.

1148
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:47,886
It's 6:42 a. m. on Saturday, May 23.

1149
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:52,515
Approximately seven hours ago,
something attacked the city.

1150
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:54,935
I don't know what it is.

1151
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,270
If you found this tape... I mean,
if you're watching this right now,

1152
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:01,233
then you probably know more
about it than I do.

1153
01:12:02,859 --> 01:12:07,113
Whatever it is,
it killed my brother, Jason Hawkins.

1154
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,283
It killed my best friend, Hudson Platt,
and Marlena Diamond,

1155
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:12,202
and many, many others.

1156
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,747
We've crashed here in Central Park
and taken shelter under this bridge.

1157
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,166
The military has begun
bombing the creature

1158
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,335
and we're caught in the middle.

1159
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,337
Okay. Ready?

1160
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,344
It's okay.

1161
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:34,390
- Beth, look at me.
- I don't know what to say.

1162
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,976
Well, just tell them who you are.

1163
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:44,818
My name is Elizabeth Mclntyre.
I don't know why this is happening.

1164
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,532
But we're gonna wait here
until this passes.

1165
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,996
Rob, we're gonna wait here.

1166
01:13:05,046 --> 01:13:07,465
Look at me, Beth.
Look at me. Look at me.

1167
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,926
- I love you.
- I love you.

1168
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,309
I know what I'm talking about.
Come on, admit it.

1169
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,060
You are going to miss me
a little bit, right?

1170
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,604
Yeah, we'll see.

1171
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,480
Okay, yeah, all right.

1172
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,984
All right, we're almost out of tape.
We got, like, three seconds left.

1173
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,193
What do you wanna say?
What do you wanna say?

1174
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,360
Last thing to the camera.

1175
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:31,488
I had a good day.
