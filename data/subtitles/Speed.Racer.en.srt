1
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,953
All drivers to your cars.

2
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,499
-Distracted?
-No that's not exactly right.

3
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,335
Your son seems to be interested
in only one thing.

4
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,506
All he talks about, all he seems
capable of thinking about. . .

5
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,049
. ..is automobile racing.

6
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,136
Well' you know'
his father designs racing cars.

7
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,637
And where is your husband?

8
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,391
Working. He couldn't be here.

9
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,145
Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen
very far from the tree.

10
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,481
ls your husband's name Rex?

11
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,525
No, that's his older brother, Rex. Why?

12
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,572
This is the test he turned in last week.

13
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,534
Hm.

14
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,092
All right, pencils down.

15
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,720
Take your answer sheets' place it
into the first part of your booklet. . .

16
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,765
. ..pack up your things
and bring your. . .to my desk.

17
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,892
Speed Racer' slow down!

18
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,033
Take it you're ready to go?

19
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,333
-How was school?
-Fine.

20
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,627
Are you going to the track?
Mom said you were.

21
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,755
You don't have to drop me off.
l could just go with you?.

22
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,299
-No way.
-Oh' come on.

23
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,051
Take me with you. Come on' please.

24
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,178
l can't, Speed.

25
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,806
-Pops would kill me.
-He doesn't have to know.

26
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,767
l won't say anything. Nobody will know.

27
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:53,107
Come on, please, Rex.
Please' please' please.

28
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,988
Are you wearing the socks?

29
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,449
Hm? Hm?

30
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,661
Okay. But if you roll us again,
this'll be the last time.

31
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,622
Deal?

32
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,206
Deal.

33
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,937
Oh' yeah!

34
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,189
Come on!

35
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,816
Yee-haw!

36
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,196
You feel that shimmy? lt's your hind legs
trying to outrun your front.

37
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,530
What do l do?

38
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,241
You stop steering and you start driving.

39
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,372
This ain't no dead piece of metal.

40
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,541
A car is a living, breathing thing, all right?
She's alive.

41
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,506
You can feel her talking to you, telling you?
what she wants' what she needs. Listen.

42
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,302
Close your eyes and listen.

43
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,392
They say that Ben Burns drove the final lap
of the Vanderbilt Cup with his eyes closed.

44
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,686
-No way!
-No?

45
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,106
Maybe you just can't hear it' then.
Ought to start hitting those books.

46
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,567
-No, l hear it!
-Oh' is that so, Mr. Burns?

47
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,612
All right.
Tell me when to punch it for the jump.

48
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,742
-Now?
-Uh-Uh.

49
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,413
Now!

50
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,152
Local fan favorite Speed Racer
is gobbling up this track.

51
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,830
Let us hope he does not make
the same mistakes that his brother made.

52
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,592
Heads up' Speed. Seven o'clock.
l got Snake draffing Pitter-Pat.

53
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,469
l got him.

54
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,059
l figure he'll slingshot after you
in the next turn.

55
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,269
l'm ready.

56
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,659
Great move' Speed!

57
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,420
All right, watch out
for the dog balls coming up.

58
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,963
You may wanna ease off a little.

59
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,007
Not this time, Sparky.

60
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,154
Holy cannoli, Speed.

61
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,032
-You know who you're racing?
-Yeah.

62
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,846
Rex is gonna win it' ain't he, Pops?

63
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,723
Nobody's gonna catch him.
He's gonna win it.

64
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,893
He's gonna set the course record.
Nobody's gonna stop him.

65
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,980
-Quiet. There's still a lot of race to go.
-No way. lt's over.

66
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:05,401
My brother's the best racer in the world.
Everyone else is running for second.

67
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,902
Yeah!

68
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,407
l told you to take him out!

69
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,660
We're trying, sir' we're trying,
but he's just too fast.

70
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,089
lt's unbelievable, folks!

71
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,343
No one has seen moves like this since that
remarkable night eight years ago.

72
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,762
There's no doubt in my mind.
He's gunning for the record.

73
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,766
He is not alone out there,
he is chasing someone.

74
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,102
He is chasing the ghost of Rex Racer.

75
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,447
Jeepers, he could do it, Pops.
He could really do it.

76
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,991
What if he does it?
What if he does it' Pops?

77
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,454
l don't know if l can watch this.

78
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,607
There's that Speed Racer.

79
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,152
My daddy told me that his daddy used to
work for the Mishida MotorWerks. . .

80
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,154
. ..but he quit.

81
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,324
My daddy told me that it was
a completely crazy thing to do.

82
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,368
He says the whole family is crazy.

83
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,453
Speed's not crazy.

84
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,996
No. He's just dumb.

85
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,707
Probably the dumbest kid in the class.

86
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,794
Mrs. Waterstraat had me
alphabetize the lRB tests. . .

87
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,130
. ..and you wouldn't believe
what the retard did.

88
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:10,985
Speed!

89
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,363
Are you? all right?

90
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,535
Who are you?

91
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,997
l'm Trixie. l'm in your class.

92
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,082
Oh' yeah.

93
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,960
Hey, you wanna see my car collection?

94
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,713
l'd love to.

95
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,264
Hey, Rex. Hey' Pops.

96
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,391
-Hey' Speedy.
-Who's your friend?

97
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,393
Her name's Trixie . She's in my class.

98
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,812
-Hi.
-Pleasure to meet you' young lady.

99
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,025
Hey, Pops' a guy told me to
give this to you. Says he was a big fan.

100
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,235
Oh. A fan' is it?

101
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,031
Well' it's not every day we get people
with such good taste around here.

102
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,242
-Where is he?
-He was in a hurry' driving a '68 Fendersin.

103
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,911
-Sweet set of wheels.
-Let me see that.

104
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,260
Cool beans.

105
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,564
No one from these parts will ever forget
the tragic story of Rex Racer.

106
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,194
He nearly ruined racing.

107
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,113
One of the bravest men
to ever drive a race car.

108
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,244
Can l come with you, Rex?

109
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,040
Not this time, Speedy.

110
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,418
When are you coming back?

111
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,172
l don't know. l don't know.

112
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,845
Hey, there's something
l want you to have.

113
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,474
But the Mach 5's your car.

114
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,560
Not anymore.

115
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,190
Look, Speed. . .

116
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,280
. ..one day, people might
say things about me.

117
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,409
But no matter what they say. . .

118
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,993
. ..l just--

119
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,163
Look, l hope you? never believe them.

120
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,749
l won't.

121
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,586
Come here.

122
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,719
So you're quitting?

123
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,056
l have to.

124
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,853
No, you don't. This is a choice.
You're selling out.

125
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,772
Turning your back
on everything we built here.

126
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,858
l'm done arguing with you' Pops.

127
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,693
Don't you turn your back on me.

128
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,948
You can't tell me what to do.
lt's my life to live.

129
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,034
You walk out that door now'
you better not ever come back.

130
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,801
Rex Racer,
driving the black-and-red Uniron car.. .

131
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,721
. . .got into a tangle with Richenbach ,
who was favored to win.

132
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,056
That was no tangle.
He took Richenbach out.

133
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,766
Well, we don't know that...

134
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,977
.. .but l imagine the WRL
will be reviewing this crash .

135
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,354
That's the third DNF crash
Racer's been in.

136
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,982
-Turn it off, Speed.
-They ought to just suspend him.

137
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,568
l don't want you watching this anymore.

138
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,323
The trial of Rex Racer shook the World
Racing League to its very foundation.

139
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,742
Once a rat' always a rat...

140
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,996
. ..and in my book'
Rex Racer's nothing but a rat.

141
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,498
Did you see that?

142
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,709
That will definiteIy leave a mark.

143
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,420
And Rex Racer nearly took
Yokima's head oft with that jump.

144
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,506
Hey, there is no doubt in my mind.. .

145
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,092
...that Rex Racer is one of
the dirtiest drivers in the world.

146
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,346
For five years' Rex Racer took orders
from the criminal underworld.

147
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,938
Fight! Fight! Fight!

148
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,026
No! You stop this!
You stop it right now!

149
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,778
l just told him the truth!

150
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:26,073
His crumbum brother doesn't belong
on a racetrack, he belongs in jail!

151
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,412
The indictment brought down the
perennial racing powerhouse' Uniron.

152
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,124
Uniron was linked to the notorious fixer'
Blackjack Benelli.

153
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,626
Still in prison today. ..

154
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,964
. ..Benelli was rumored to be
behind the Casa Cristo tragedy.

155
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,387
This is one of the worst crashes
I have ever s--

156
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,891
How could this happen? This is terrible .

157
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,601
This is just terrible.

158
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,397
And still no sign of driver Rex Racer.

159
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,820
Oh.

160
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,366
l know.

161
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,461
Go! Go! Go!

162
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,726
Go! Go! Go!

163
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,192
"Forget the past"' he's saying.
"This is my night!"

164
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,206
-He's coming hard.
-lt's gonna be close!

165
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:22,230
Unbelievable!
A split second late. The record still stands.

166
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,659
Come on, let's go. Victory Lane.

167
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:38,747
Folks, I knew Rex Racer, and if he's up
there somewhere watching this race. . .

168
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:43,460
.. .you can bet your ass
he's damn proud of his Iittle brother.

169
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,382
Pulling into
Victory Lane , the winner, Speed Racer!

170
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,842
He's going to be very good.

171
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,596
No, he's going to be the best. . .

172
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,184
. ..if they don't destroy him first.

173
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,639
Hi-ya!

174
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,103
Ha! Ha! Ha!

175
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,150
Hey, hey! What are you two doing?

176
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,776
Nothing.

177
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,654
Was that the same nothing
that broke my last couch?

178
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,615
No, that was a totally different nothing.

179
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,034
Got it!

180
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,370
-Racer residence.
-Morning.

181
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,540
-May I speak to Speed Racer?
-He's not interested.

182
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,833
-Spritle?
-What?

183
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,501
Was that for Speed?

184
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,129
Yeah, but Speed
doesn't wanna talk to them.

185
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,338
You don't know that.

186
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,176
Sure' l do. Speed's gotta drive for Pops.
He's gotta.

187
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,844
Well' that's for Speed to decide.

188
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,179
Now get dressed.

189
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,973
-Tell your father breakfast is ready.
-Ooh.

190
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,975
"lt was a virtuoso display of talent. . .

191
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,770
. ..which has not been seen
since Racer the elder. . .

192
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,688
. ..dropped jaws eight years ago.

193
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,900
As we once again pull our collective
jaw up from the floor, we ask:

194
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,570
-'Will it be different or will tragedy--?"'
-That's enough.

195
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,783
l can't believe there's not one mention
of Racer Motors in here .

196
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,660
That's because the sponsors
control the media, Sparky.

197
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,746
Good morning, everyone.
Good morning.

198
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,624
-ls Speed up yet?
-ln spirit' anyway.

199
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,334
Oh' thanks.

200
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,544
-Hey' superstar.
-Hey' Trix.

201
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,547
Have you seen the papers?
They're all in love with you.

202
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,216
Really?

203
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,386
Yeah. There seems to be a lot of speculation
about which team you'll sign with.

204
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,515
Really?

205
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,477
-What the--?
-Earthquake! Earthquake!

206
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,523
Quick' Pops! The kitchen is the most
dangerous place in an earthquake.

207
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,736
-Everybody' run for your life!
-Spritle' calm down!

208
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,040
Mr. Racer, morning.

209
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,708
What?

210
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,171
Oh' um, may l. . .?

211
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,881
Oh!

212
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,764
Mr. and Mrs. Racer'
l hope you will forgive this imposition.

213
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:46,059
These are bluebells from Eden' lnc.

214
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:50,438
l'm told they'll bloom at least three times,
each time a different color.

215
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,440
And Mr. Racer' these are for you.

216
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,862
Straight from the lsle of Kamut,
hand-rolled' premiu?m blend.

217
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,573
Thanks, but who are you??

218
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,951
l am E.P . Arnold Royalton' Esquire. . .

219
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,579
. ..president and chairman
of Royalton lndustries.

220
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,873
And it is my honor to meet you both.

221
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,461
Oh' dear, l seem to have
interrupted your breakfast.

222
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,463
ls that pancakes l smell?

223
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,050
Oh' are you hungry' Mr. Royalton?

224
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,512
A figure like mine requires
constant attention' Mrs. Racer.

225
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,097
And do you like pancakes?

226
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,309
When l was a child' we used to say:

227
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,774
Pancakes are love.

228
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,656
Mm. Mm.

229
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,284
Gorgeous, Mrs. Racer.

230
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,789
Superb density. Hints of vanilla.
Cinnamon?

231
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,251
-That's right.
-Absolutely gorgeous.

232
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,839
-Well' l'm glad you like them.
-Like them? l wanna buy your recipe .

233
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,509
-Oh! l'll give you the recipe, Mr. Royalton.
-Nonsense!

234
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,262
Cenestro Foods, a subdivision
of Royalton lndustries. . .

235
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,140
. ..is planning a range
of homecooked meals for travelers. . .

236
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,851
. ..and this is just the kind of magic
we're looking for.

237
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,354
l'll have my attorney
draw up the paperWork.

238
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:13,688
Hmm.

239
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,735
Now then, we all know the reason
l'm here is because of you, Speed.

240
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,654
l was watching last night. . .

241
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,783
. ..and l have to tell you, young man,
you gave me goose bumps.

242
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:30,705
l knew at once this was no mere driver
l was watching. This was an artist.

243
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,540
Oh. . . .

244
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:36,211
l imagine the phone's
been ringing off the hook.

245
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:40,715
Yeah. But Speed doesn't wanna
drive for you or any other sponsors.

246
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,759
ls this your manager, then?

247
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,221
-That's our youngest' Spritle .
-Nice to meet you, youngster.

248
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,557
We got our eye on you' mister.

249
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,978
Excellent.

250
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:57,482
The first thing l want to make clear
is that l have no intention whatsoever. ..

251
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,402
. ..of trying to get Speed
away from Racer Motors.

252
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,196
What you have here
is what teams spend years.. .

253
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,741
. ..and millions of dollars
trying to achieve' chemistry.

254
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,910
l wouldn't dare touch a thing.

255
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,415
Well' excuse me for asking'
but what do you want?

256
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,917
To help.

257
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:20,005
l want to make sure you have access
to whatever resources you need. . .

258
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,424
. ..to continue doing
exactly what you're doing.

259
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,428
No offense' Royalton' but Racer Motors
has always run as an independent.

260
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,347
None taken. l completely understand.
l sympathize.

261
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,559
-Strike that. l empathize.
-Hmm.

262
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:35,437
You may think of R.l .
as a huge corporate conglomerate. . .

263
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,690
. ..but l will have you know
l still remember working all night. . .

264
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:42,610
. ..on a Commodore 64 in the basement
of my foster parents' home.

265
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,822
l built R.l. from below the ground up.

266
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,617
So while Royalton lndustries
may look like a major sponsor to you. . .

267
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,620
. ..it remains in my heart
as independent to me. . .

268
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:57,917
. ..as the first day l quit my job at GloBoCom
to start working for myself.

269
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,129
Now then. . .

270
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:07,260
. ..l've had this wonderful opportunity
to meet your family.

271
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,681
All l'm asking for is the chance
to introduce you to mine.

272
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,151
l've never flown so low through the city.

273
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,988
Special permit.
Only six of them are granted a year.

274
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,496
Take whatever you like.

275
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,247
Thank you.

276
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,585
-Spritle!
-What? She said we could have some.

277
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,881
All right, maybe one a piece.

278
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,177
Hey, look,
that's the Grand Prix Colosseum.

279
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,513
My brother's gonna win
the Grand Prix someday.

280
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,015
No doubt in my mind' young man.

281
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:58,686
Given the right circumstances'
no doubt in my mind whatsoever.

282
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,336
This is Gennie' our talent manager.

283
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,798
Ask for anything.
Her job is to make it come true.

284
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,509
Hello' Speed. Welcome to Royalton.

285
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,141
-What's this?
-To make an informed decision. . .

286
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,060
. ..you'll have to understand
how we take care of our drivers.

287
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,895
All aboard.

288
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,064
Oh' cool!

289
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:56,661
Royalton Tower is the crown jewel
among the properties that l control.

290
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,915
lt functions as the corporate headquarters
for the top 12 divisions of our parent corp.

291
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,419
One big industrious family.

292
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:11,176
Our vertically integrated plant
is the fastest in the world. . .

293
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,763
. ..from initial carbon bond to finished car
in 36 hours.

294
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,144
How long does it take at Racer Motors?

295
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,438
-Mmm.. . .
-Several weeks, at least.

296
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:28,735
This kind of production facility
could be at your disposal, Mr. Racer.

297
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:29,944
Hm. Yeah.

298
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,988
This is our operating theater. . .

299
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:36,659
. ..where our patented Refusion Distributor
is installed in the turbine drive.

300
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,578
ls that an lnner-Positive Transponder?

301
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:42,290
We control the only transponder foundry
in the world. . .

302
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,876
. ..outside of Musha Motors.

303
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,796
Oops. Sorry' trade secret.

304
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:54,010
As you know' a T-180 driver's
got to be in peak physical condition.

305
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,639
No expense is spared to ensure that
when our drivers suit up. . .

306
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:02,352
. ..they are as perfectly tuned as
the machines they are controlling.

307
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,231
The best drivers must be able
to withstand over four G's of force . ..

308
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,441
. ..in a typical race.

309
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:12,195
The will to win is nothing
without the will to prepare.

310
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:19,786
And at Team Royalton,
we prepare our drivers for any eventuality. . .

311
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,997
. ..and every possible condition.

312
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,341
l hope l didn't scare you, Speed,
with how hard we push our team.

313
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,344
l just wanted you to see
how committed we are to winning.

314
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,556
-l get that.
-Good.

315
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,644
Because l also want you to understand
that R. l . isn't all work and no play.

316
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,786
That's Cannonball Taylor.

317
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,873
Stop the car. Jack.

318
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,876
Jack, come here.

319
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,713
There's someone l'd like you to meet.

320
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,881
Speed Racer.

321
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,385
Allow me to introduce
two-time Grand Prix winner. . .

322
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:21,556
. ..five-time WRL Champion
and future hall of famer. . .

323
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,683
. ..Jack "Cannonball" Taylor.

324
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,060
Oh. . . . Honor to meet you?.

325
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,105
Caught that Thunderhead replay.

326
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,356
Nice piece of work.

327
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,483
Wow .

328
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,277
Thanks.

329
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,738
There was a rumor you might be visiting.

330
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,491
lt's pretty impressive.

331
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,579
Only thing l cared about
was that wall over there.

332
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,247
That's what sold me.

333
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,542
You want to win in this league,
you're talking to the right guy.

334
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,254
Thanks, Jack.

335
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,435
Sweet!

336
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:11,939
We treat our thoroughbreds
the way they deserve to be treated.

337
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,777
-Sweet!
-There's a full maid service, of course. . .

338
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,864
. ..with personal chef and masseurs
available 24/7 .

339
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,451
Sweet!

340
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,080
Thank you.

341
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,461
lt should be perfect. Try it on.

342
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,380
Mm-hm.

343
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,174
Okay.

344
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,971
So, Mrs. Racer. . .

345
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,934
. ..what do you think about my family?
lmpressed?

346
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,771
-You could say that.
-Good.

347
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:56,067
Because l want you to understand the
possibilities that exist for your son now.

348
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,444
What's wrong, Mr. Racer?

349
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:03,116
To be honest, Royalton, l'm feeling
more intimidated than impressed.

350
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,576
This kind of company scares me .

351
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,538
People like you
have way too much money.

352
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,082
When someone gets that kind of money,
they think. ..

353
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,253
. ..that the rules everybody else plays by
don't mean squat to them.

354
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:20,633
However, my sons are the most important
thing l've ever done in my life. . .

355
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,052
. ..besides marrying my best friend.

356
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,307
And if Speed wants us to
figure out some kind of an alliance. . .

357
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,688
. ..then you can bet your ass
we'll be in business.

358
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,314
Ah.

359
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:38,943
Hubba-hubba.

360
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,447
-Oh' honey, you look so handsome.
-Yeah?

361
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,324
Very sharp, Speed. Suits you perfectly.

362
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,369
Regardless of what happens,
l want you to have it as a giff.

363
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,165
Thanks, Mr. Royalton.

364
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,169
So how are you feeling, Speed?

365
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,504
lt's very.. .

366
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,214
. ..impressive.

367
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,801
You think that maybe there's something
that could work out here?

368
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,977
l guess l'd like to think about it'
if l could.

369
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,731
This isn't the kind of offer
l go around making every day' son.

370
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,568
No, l understand that, sir.

371
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:25,990
So if l had to give you an answer now'
then to be honest--

372
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,533
Stop right there.

373
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,077
You're right. You should think about it.

374
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:33,414
l'm sure you're feeling
a bit overwhelmed.

375
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,750
You should take a little time. ..

376
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:40,922
. ..think about what you saw and heard here,
and we'll get together early next week.

377
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,509
-Deal?
-Deal.

378
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,849
l thought we had a deal.

379
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,229
l thought we were friends.

380
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,277
Well' maybe where you come from'
that's how you treat your friends.

381
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:07,698
But around here' we don't take
too kindly to it, do we, fellas?

382
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,576
lt hurts our feelings.

383
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,537
Problem is. . .

384
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,790
. ..l like you' Taejo.

385
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,545
And l've got a real soft spot
in my heart. . .

386
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,256
. ..for that sister of yours.

387
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:32,640
And normally' under circumstances
such as this. . .

388
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,309
. ..we'd be pouring you a nice. . .

389
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:39,814
. ..comfortable pair of concrete shoes.

390
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:44,110
But l think l thought of another solution.

391
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,991
How are my babies, huh?

392
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,201
Hungry?

393
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,047
Ready for seconds?

394
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,883
Boys.

395
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,261
No!

396
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:14,265
Don't worry, it only hurts for a few seconds,
then you'll probably black out.

397
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,516
No, please!

398
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,439
lt'll be hard to drive with skellie hands.

399
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,817
-No, please.
-You even think about turning rat...

400
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,987
. ..and next time it's your sister
going in there!

401
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,207
-What?
-Someone's tailing us.

402
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,383
-ls it him?
-lt could be.

403
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,221
-Oh' God.
-lt's him!

404
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,318
Crush him!

405
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,173
He's out front.

406
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,349
Got you.

407
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,815
-Boss!
-My babies.

408
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:33,738
My babies! Put your finger in there.

409
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,449
Do it!

410
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:44,457
Nice fishies, nice fishes. No no' no.

411
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,001
We can't take another hit, boss!

412
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:48,586
-Aah!
-Pull over.

413
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,464
But don't stop.

414
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,654
Are you? hurt?

415
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,948
No.

416
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,867
Then get up.

417
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,373
Thank you. You saved my life.

418
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,795
l didn't save anything worth saving
unless you get smart real fast.

419
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,589
You thought you could
take on the cartel.

420
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,883
You can't. Not without help.

421
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,969
l don't know what you're talking about.

422
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,723
You have been on Cruncher Block's leash
for so long. . .

423
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:46,185
. ..maybe you forgot how it feels
to stand up and be a man.

424
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,732
The only way you'll ever stop these people
is to bring them to justice.

425
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,818
Justice?

426
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,862
That's a commodity
l don't waste my money on.

427
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:58,405
Hm.

428
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,577
Get out.

429
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,254
-l'll see you at Fuji.
-You won't finish.

430
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,757
When you lose' if you can still
dial a phone. . .

431
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,300
. ..call this number.

432
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,221
You're really considering
signing with Royalton.

433
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,599
-l just said it was tempting.
-Why?

434
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,977
Well' they got a really good team.

435
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:32,606
Cannonball Taylor' Maggie Manifold.
They win a lot of majors.

436
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,652
And since when did winning
become so important?

437
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:39,321
lt is important.

438
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,992
You gotta win if you wanna keep driving,
and that's what l wanna do.

439
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:47,454
-lt's the only thing l really know how to do.
-That's not true.

440
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,083
Come on. l wouldn't have made it
out of high school without your help.

441
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,627
Okay, well, that's true.

442
00:36:54,921 --> 00:37:00,134
But when l'm in a T-180 , l don't know'
everything just makes sense.

443
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:08,225
So are you saying
this doesn't make sense?

444
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,313
Okay, this makes sense too.

445
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,898
Oh.

446
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,983
So you like this?

447
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,820
Yeah. This ain't so bad.

448
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,908
l was starting to wonder.

449
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,327
Wonder what?

450
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:31,624
Well' with you so busy becoming
Mr. Super-Famous-Racecar-Driver. . .

451
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:36,086
. ..l was starting to wonder
if you were still interested in this.

452
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,424
-You know l am.
-Do l?

453
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,509
What, like you forgot?

454
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,346
-Maybe l need a reminder.
-A reminder.

455
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,348
Sometimes a girl could use a reminder.

456
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,184
You mean like a new igniter
for your helicopter?

457
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,518
Mm-mm.

458
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,439
Well' how about a tire burn
that spells out your name?

459
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,483
Warmer.

460
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:03,197
Maybe at the end of some big race,
when l pull into Victory Lane. . .

461
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:07,493
. ..l scoop you up and kiss you,
with thousands of flashbulbs going off.

462
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,873
Would that be so terrible,
Mr. Super-Famous-Racecar-Driver?

463
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,043
l don't know.

464
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:20,005
-Maybe we should practice.
-Maybe we should.

465
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,385
Oh' God' l'm gonna hurl.

466
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,720
-Spritle.
-He did not.

467
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,522
-Ooh, Spritle.
-You little sneak.

468
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,483
-lt wasn't my idea.
-Oh' no?

469
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,403
-lt was his.
-Wait till we tell Pops.

470
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,740
No, don't do that. We couldn't sleep.
We just wanted to hang out.

471
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,660
We didn't know you were going to
ln-spew-ation Point.

472
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,705
By the way' cootie shot.

473
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,373
l'm taking you home.

474
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:58,043
Wait. Wait.
Can we stop for ice cream first?

475
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:07,344
The new GRX has
a supercharged lnner-Positive Transponder. . .

476
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:11,807
. ..and will be capable of speeds
in excess of 800 kilometers an hour.

477
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:15,853
lf such a car were to
win the Grand Prix this year. ..

478
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:20,441
. ..one would expect the demand for
transponders to increase dramatically.

479
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,109
One would expect.

480
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:27,865
And if a single company gained control of
all the transponder foundries in the world. . .

481
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:31,493
. ..one might expect that company
to do very well for itself.

482
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,246
You know what l want.
l know for the last few years. ..

483
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,458
. ..you've been trying to buy out
your main rival, Tetsua Togokahn.

484
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,252
The question is, can we make a deal?

485
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:48,719
Deliver Togokahn at that price
and the transponder foundry is yours.

486
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:50,846
Done.

487
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:01,815
-Speed!
-Mr. Royalton.

488
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,859
Welcome!

489
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,488
Come here. Look at this.

490
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,034
Oh.

491
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,494
Wow .

492
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,498
That's what l thought. We're still working
on the R and R' but it's getting there.

493
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,292
Come, sit. We can talk logos later.

494
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,630
Can l get you something to drink?
Water? Bubbly? A shot of rye?

495
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,924
No. l'm okay.

496
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:33,514
So l can see you've been giving
some serious thought to this thing.

497
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:38,477
-l have. Yes, sir.
-Good.

498
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:41,563
Means you understand we're talking
about not just your future. . .

499
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,148
. ..but your family's future.

500
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,943
My family means a lot to me.

501
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,362
l know. l can tell.

502
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,699
That's why this is so important'
because you can help them.

503
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,701
All you have to say is yes.

504
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,620
That's all l need to hear.. .

505
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,832
. ..and l can make so many things happen
for you and your family.

506
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,336
You ready for that?

507
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,547
You ready to say yes' Speed?

508
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,243
Jackpot.

509
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,663
Oh' boy' oh' boy.

510
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,751
This isn't an easy decision for me'
Mr. Royalton.

511
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,633
For my family, racing's everything.

512
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:56,180
l was tooling timing pins with Pops
while l was still wearing diapers.

513
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,392
l mean, there's nothing more perfect
than a picnic at Thunderhead.

514
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:08,984
But when my brother died,
all that went away.

515
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:12,321
l can't tell you how painful that was.

516
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,907
lt nearly killed all of us.

517
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,784
Especially Pops.

518
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:21,288
He didn't set foot in his shop
for over a year.

519
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,960
But one night' when l was still
pretty young, l couldn't sleep. . .

520
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,714
. ..and l went into the living room'
and there was Pops in his beat-up robe. . .

521
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,425
. ..watching some old race recordings.

522
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,723
So l sat with him there. . .

523
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:44,519
. ..watching old Ben Burns coming around
the last turn of the 43 Prix and. . .

524
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,898
. ..all of a sudden,
Pops started screaming.

525
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,233
Go!

526
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,318
And then I started screaming.

527
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,447
As Burns and Stickleton
headed for the finish. . .

528
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,574
. ..we were cheering our heads off.

529
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,289
And the second the black-and-white
came down.. .

530
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,751
. ..we looked at each other
and we realized. . .

531
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,379
. ..racing's in our blood.

532
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,966
But for Pops.. .

533
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,385
. ..it isn't just a sport.

534
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,179
lt's way more important than that.

535
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,807
lt's like a religion.

536
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:25,310
And in our house, the major sponsors. . .

537
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,187
. ..are kind of like the devil.

538
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:32,651
l don't mean to offend you, sir'
and l do appreciate your offer. . .

539
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,280
. ..but affer all we've been through. . .

540
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,325
. ..l don't think this kind of deal's for me.

541
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,503
You poor, naive chump.

542
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:57,426
l'll pretend l didn't hear
that sickening schmaltz. . .

543
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,595
. ..and l'll give you an education.
At the end, if you're smart.. .

544
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:04,016
. ..you'll thank me
and then you'll sign that contract.

545
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:15,902
Huh?

546
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,245
Jig's up.

547
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,000
Holy moly.

548
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,755
Hey. This is Marvin,
down at the landing pad.

549
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,424
l think we got mice again.

550
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,594
All right. We'll send
someone over to take care of it. Over.

551
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:45,515
Look. There is the true spirit
of the golden age of racing.

552
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:50,771
Benjamin Braddack, Reginald White' George
Wheeler, Diamond Dave Tewksbury. ..

553
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,522
. ..and Oliver Potter.

554
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:56,526
The five most powerful men in the world
at the turn of the last century.

555
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,530
For all intents and purposes' they created
the modern automotive industry.

556
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:04,451
But the true stroke of their genius
was the invention of the WRL. . .

557
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,953
. . .the worId's first racing league .

558
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:19,299
lnteresting that you and your father
were so moved by the 43 Prix.

559
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,219
One of the great finishes
in the history of racing, right?

560
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:26,473
Everyone remembers Burns and Stickleton
slugging it out.

561
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,601
But who remembers Carl Potts?

562
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,772
Driving this rebuilt Wittigan
for lodyne lndustries. . .

563
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,150
. ..Potts spun out in the second lap
and went down as a DNF . . .

564
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,444
...a forgettable and pathetic finish .

565
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:44,157
So bad that afterwards'
lodyne stock dropped six points.

566
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:48,995
But as Ben Burns sat guzzling
cold, fresh milk in Victory Lane. . .

567
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,164
...a thousand cameras
taking his picture ...

568
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,167
. ..Sirrus Aeronautics saw
almost a 12-point gain. . .

569
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,586
. ..which blocked Penninsula Power Cell. . .

570
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,172
. ..from being able to afford
the price of a takeover.

571
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,969
This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of lodyne,
lnc. in the exact position he wanted to be in.

572
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:07,764
By first buying controlling interest
in his own company at a devalued price...

573
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:12,769
. ..he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that
sent lodyne into the gains record book.. .

574
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,689
. ..the only record book that matters.

575
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:19,860
Look out that window. There isn't
a single plane or helicopter or K-Harrier. ..

576
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,696
. ..that isn't powered by lodyne fuel cells.

577
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:26,992
That's what racing is about.
lt has nothing to do with cars or drivers.

578
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,371
All that matters is power
and the unassailable might of money.

579
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,873
Whoo!

580
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,333
Dude! Yeah!

581
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,881
Oh' no! Woo-hoo!

582
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,051
Get out of the way! Out of the way!
Get out of the way!

583
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,939
You understand?

584
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,901
Burns knew he was going to win.

585
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,862
lt was already decided.

586
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,698
A week before the Prix'
Goldman and Sirrus. . .

587
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,493
. ..met with other major players
at the Cargyle Hotel.

588
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,411
They met there as they had for years.

589
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,248
They met to negotiate
the finish order of the Grand Prix.

590
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:19,252
No race is more important
and no race is more controlled.

591
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,256
Goldman was supposed to win,
but he knew if he sold his win...

592
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:27,511
. ..whatever that win might be worth was
nothing compared to what could be gained.

593
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:33,308
That's why l spent $3 million
on this burnt and twisted lump of metal.

594
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,144
Because it reminds me
of what really matters.

595
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:40,315
This is the true heart of racing, boy.

596
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:43,860
This is my religion.

597
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,075
You don't know how offen
l've seen that same cow-eyed. . .

598
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,202
. .."say it isn't so" look of disbelief.

599
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,914
Every bumpkin who comes in from
the sticks looks exactly as you do now.

600
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,624
l won't bother proving it to you.

601
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:01,753
You walk away from me and this deal'
you'll know how true it is soon enough.

602
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:05,590
So last chance. You ready to
put away your toys and grow up?

603
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:09,427
Are you ready to make more money in
one year than your father made in his life?

604
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:13,807
Are you ready to become a real
racecar driver? Then sign that contract!

605
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,324
Spearhook.

606
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,508
What's this?

607
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,511
lf that's your idea of racing,
you can keep it.

608
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,852
Listen to me and listen good. . .

609
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,521
. ..because l'm gonna give you
one more history lesson.

610
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:05,900
You're gonna go to Fuji and try and prove
everything l told you is nothing but a lie.

611
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,070
But no matter how well you drive,
you won't win, you won't place.

612
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:13,116
l guarantee you right now'
you won't even finish the race.

613
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,294
Speed Racer's making his move,
gunning for the lead.

614
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:44,814
Ha!

615
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,494
The Harbinger of Boom
once again leaves his mark. . .

616
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,246
. ..a trail of carnage and chaos
cartwheeling behind him!

617
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,458
-Oh' but the fans love it, don't they?
-They do' God help them.

618
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,419
They're about to get more
as lodyne is now slugging it out.. .

619
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,546
.. .with young Taejo Togokahn.

620
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,094
Whoo!

621
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:41,663
Oh, terrible crash!

622
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:44,332
They'Il have to fish
Taejo and BilIy Ray out of the drink.

623
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,209
But this race is far from over.

624
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:50,213
Right now, one car
stands between Speed Racer and the lead:

625
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:53,049
-The Grey Ghost.
-We got ourselves a real race here!

626
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:01,099
Show me what you got.
Show me what you got!

627
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,063
Woo-hoo!

628
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:21,536
-Speed, get out of there!
-l can't. l can't move!

629
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:45,935
Soon affer that, there will be litigation
against some of your father's designs.

630
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:48,772
Are you Pops Racer of Racer Motors?

631
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,192
-Yeah, but l'm still on vacation.
-You are hereby served a summons.

632
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,612
-What?
-You are being sued for lP infringement...

633
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,447
. ..by Janus Automakers.

634
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,866
-No way!
-That's ridiculous.

635
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,702
That's for a jury to decide.

636
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:06,080
The Iegitimacy of the lawsuits won't matter.

637
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,500
They'll be enough
to discredit his company.

638
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:12,670
Whatever contracts he has, he'll lose.
Within a year, he'll be filing for bankruptcy.

639
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,841
After that' you and the rest of
your pathetic family will be history.

640
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:19,928
Pops is right.

641
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,721
You are the devil.

642
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,475
-Mr. Royalton.
-What?!

643
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:27,310
-Speed!
-Spritle?

644
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,396
l found these two sneaking around
a restricted area.

645
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,525
Get this Racer trash out of my building.

646
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,277
-l'll see you in Fuji.
-Yes.

647
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:40,490
And then you'll find out you just made
the biggest mistake of your life!

648
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,543
Hey, kid.

649
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,924
-Ben Burns?
-Nice race.

650
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,760
l ain't seen moves like that
in a long time.

651
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,514
lt didn't matter, l still lost.

652
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:07,600
Yeah. Tough break.

653
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:14,816
Well' good luck.

654
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,697
Mr. Burns, can l ask you? something?

655
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,116
Sure' kid.

656
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,703
The 43 Prix.

657
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:31,124
Did you know you were gonna win?

658
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,796
You know, everybody thought that
me and Stickleton hated each other.

659
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,841
Funny, ain't it?

660
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:50,560
"Controversy surrounds Racer
Motors' now embroiled in lP litigation.

661
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,729
And while evidence
remains inconclusive. . .

662
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,315
. ..whether or not Speed
used an illegal device. . .

663
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,819
. ...the Fuji-Helexicon seems destined to
become another mark of shame. . .

664
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,530
. ..added to the notorious
Racer family legacy. . .

665
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,575
. ..a legacy that has forever tainted
the integrity of this--"

666
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,327
Sparky.

667
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,121
Sorry' ma'am.

668
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,624
l'm gonna send that guy
some Chim Chim cookies.

669
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,836
-You'll do no such thing.
-We gotta do something, Pops.

670
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,256
This is exactly what he said would happen
if l didn't drive for him.

671
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:23,509
He's just trying to scare you.
They tried the same thing with Rex.

672
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,929
lt's a fight they want,
it's a fight they'll get.

673
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:30,016
How? What can we do?
How can we fight this?

674
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,768
The truth'll come out.

675
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,312
The truth?

676
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,773
Don't be naive, Pops.

677
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,874
Speed?

678
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,627
Are you? all right?

679
00:54:58,712 --> 00:54:59,837
l don't know.

680
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,346
lt's gonna be okay. We'll work this out.

681
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,434
l don't know, Mom.
l may have really messed things up.

682
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:15,478
How?

683
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,897
By not joining Royalton.

684
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:22,694
Oh' don't be silly. You never would have
been happy racing for that terrible man.

685
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,239
Maybe that's not the point.

686
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:29,033
Maybe Royalton's right
and racing's all about business. . .

687
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,869
. ..and anyone who doesn't understand
that is just a chump.

688
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,579
Now you listen to me, young man.

689
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:39,002
What you do behind the wheel of a race car
has nothing to do with business.

690
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,880
Before you could even talk, you were
making noises that sounded like an engine.

691
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:46,926
We tried to take you to the park
and you never wanted to get out of the car.

692
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,553
l loved that old wagon.

693
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:53,182
And you remember when Rex took you out
to Thunderhead and let you drive?

694
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:55,143
And l turned it over.

695
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,563
Oh' my heart starts pounding
just thinking about it.

696
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:05,153
Mom! Yeah, you should've seen it! Yeah!

697
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,741
Rex told me the only reason we survived
was because l was wearing red socks.

698
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,201
l thought your father
would have a heart attack. . .

699
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,287
. ..when you came in
with that crazy smile.

700
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:20,251
Speed' when l watch you do
some of the things you do. . .

701
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:25,173
. ..l feel like l'm watching
someone paint or make music.

702
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,843
l go to the races to watch you make art.

703
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,845
And it's beautiful. . .

704
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,472
. ..and inspiring. . .

705
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,475
. ..and everything that art should be.

706
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:41,647
Even though there are times
when l have to close my eyes.

707
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,777
But then there are other times. . .

708
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,488
. ..when you just take my breath away.

709
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:54,160
And it's at those moments
when l feel your father's chest swell. . .

710
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,953
. ..and l know that he's smiling. ..

711
00:56:56,121 --> 00:57:00,124
. ..because he's pretending that
he doesn't have tears in his eyes. . .

712
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,502
. ..that l just go to pieces.

713
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,171
Why?

714
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:10,968
Because l am so impossibly proud
to be your mom.

715
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,766
lt's gonna be okay, honey.
You'll see. We'll work this out.

716
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:20,812
We just have to stick together
and something good will happen.

717
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:21,979
You'll see.

718
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,370
Racer X! The Harbinger of Boom!

719
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:38,704
Run for your lives!

720
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:44,877
What are you two squawking about?

721
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:48,131
Pops' whatever you do,
don't open that door.

722
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:51,968
This is a bad idea.

723
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,137
lf it was any other driver' you'd be here.

724
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,723
lnspector Detector.

725
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,519
Good morning, Mr. Racer.
l know it's been a long time.

726
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,396
Ten years.

727
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:08,109
We've been after Royalton for years
for dozens of capital corporate crimes.. .

728
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:13,072
. ..including WRL fixing' but we haven't had
the evidence we needed to convict him. . .

729
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,532
. ..until now.

730
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,534
What's he doing here?

731
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:19,745
Racer X works closely with our
WRL Corporate Crimes Division. . .

732
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,081
. ..helping us recruit
drivers like you' Speed.

733
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,585
Why does he always wear that mask?

734
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:29,380
lf any of you knew his identity'
you'd become targets for his enemies. . .

735
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:33,259
. ..which include some of
the most vicious fixers in the world.

736
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:36,512
What do you? want with me?

737
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,098
Are you familiar with the driver
Taejo Togokahn?

738
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,933
-Of course.
-For years. . .

739
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,604
. ..he's been contracted by a fixer
named Cruncher Block.

740
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,232
Recently, Taejo's been forced to lose races,
and he began resisting...

741
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,943
.. .thinking that he could do it on his own.

742
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,781
-After Fuji' he realized he needed help.
-Why help him?

743
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:59,702
Because he has a file with enough
information to connect Block to Royalton. . .

744
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:03,247
. ..which could put both of them
behind bars for the rest of their lives.

745
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,458
The problem is,
he won't give us the file. . .

746
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:09,545
. ..unless we help him stop
the takeover of his family's company.

747
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,130
How?

748
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,385
There's an upcoming race
that Taejo believes if he can win. ..

749
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,096
. ..it'll catapult Togokahn Motors
into the spotlight...

750
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,807
. ..double the cost of the buyout,
which should kill it.

751
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,602
There aren't any more races left
except the Grand Prix...

752
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,646
. ..and we both failed to qualify.

753
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:30,316
Ahem. There aren't any more track races.

754
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,110
This is a cross-country rally.

755
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,154
Casa Cristo.

756
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:36,822
What?

757
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,158
l know it seems cruel of me to ask.

758
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,161
Taejo made it clear he had
to have Speed and X on his team. . .

759
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,664
-. . .or there would be no deal.
-Absolutely not.

760
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,500
-You'll have the support of the entire C.l.B.
-No.

761
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:52,213
Rally racing is a back-alley sport
filled with jackals' headhunters and thugs.

762
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:56,842
l'm sorry, but l've already lost one son
to that deathtrap. l won't lose another.

763
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,428
l understand.

764
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:03,432
-lf you change your mind. . . .
-Keep your card, Chief lnspector.

765
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,768
Thank you for your time.

766
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,194
But Pops'll never let you go.

767
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,823
He won't if l ask him.

768
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,784
Speed Racer' what are you thinking?

769
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,203
You weren't in Royalton's office, Trix.

770
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,872
You don't know what it was like.

771
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,458
lt felt as though he had his hand
inside my chest. . .

772
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,421
. ..and he was trying to crush everything
in my life that mattered to me.

773
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,718
All right. Let's do it.

774
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:42,263
You're gonna need an alibi.
We'll say we're going skiing.

775
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:43,973
What? No way.

776
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,599
You're gonna need my help.

777
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,394
Casa Cristo is a rally.
l can spot from a copter.

778
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:52,148
Trixie, this isn't a game.
These people play rough.

779
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:55,401
l know. That's why l'm going with you.

780
01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:00,948
lf you even try to argue with me, l'll tell
Pops and he'll never let you out of his sight.

781
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,742
You would, wouldn't you?

782
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,079
Well. . .

783
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,999
. ..l guess We're going skiing.

784
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,211
We're just minutes away from the start. . .

785
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,088
...of the 82nd annual
Casa Cristo Classic. . .

786
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:19,842
. . .the grande dame of cross-country,
the second-oldest rally race in the world...

787
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,470
.. .spanning two continents,
three climate changes. . .

788
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:26,766
. . .and 5,000 kilometers of the most
winding and treacherous roads ever raced.

789
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,268
With me again is five-time
Casa Cristo champion. . .

790
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,355
-Spritle.
-. . .Johnny "Goodboy" Jones.

791
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,775
What are you two doing?

792
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:38,736
Just watching a little TV' Pops.

793
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,571
lt's his favorite show.

794
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,869
-lt's in German.
-Not the monkey parts.

795
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,872
Oh' no' you don't.
You are not watching that race.

796
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,875
Out you go. Outside . Get some exercise.

797
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:55,336
You're too pale.

798
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,879
Speed.

799
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:01,842
l want you to understand how much
the C.l.B. appreciates your help on this.

800
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,345
l'm not doing this to help the C.l.B.

801
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:08,557
l don't know anything about corporate
crimes and if l did, it wouldn't really matter.

802
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,477
l'm doing this because
someone's trying to hurt my family...

803
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:14,772
. ..and l'm gonna do everything l can
to hurt him back.

804
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:20,027
Safety has been a primary concern for Casa
Cristo officials' especially the last few years.

805
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,988
That's right. There were
a number of fatalities years ago.

806
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,074
It really had a bad reputation.

807
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,284
Fans started calling it "The Crucible ."

808
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:30,121
These are some of the most dangerous
drivers in the world.

809
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,998
And we expect they'll
do anything they can to stop you?.

810
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,835
Their cars will probably be equipped
with secret weapons. . .

811
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,296
. ..so we've modified the Mach 5
to try to counter their attacks.

812
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,425
The A button will operate
your normal jump-jacks.

813
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,679
B will seal your cockpit' which we
fortified with bulletproof polymer.

814
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:50,391
Should someone go after your tires with,
say, a hidden shank or shredder. . .

815
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,144
. ..the C button will activate
your tire shields.

816
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,146
However, in the event of any blowout.. .

817
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,232
. ..D will inflate
a Hexadyno emergency spare.

818
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,193
E will activate these
zircon-tipped saw blades.

819
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,989
They'll cut through almost anything.
Use with discretion.

820
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:07,616
F will project the tire crampons.

821
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,244
Finally, G will launch
a remote-control homing bird. . .

822
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,873
. ..that is capable of transmitting
U-CAP footage anywhere you are.

823
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,000
Every race fan has heard the rumors. . .

824
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:19,086
. ..of spearhooks' tire shanks,
battery boosters.

825
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,964
Oh' no. While it's true
there have been a few bad apples. . .

826
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,884
. ..on the whole' most teams
stay within league rules.

827
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:34,351
Or at least try not to get caught.

828
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,690
This is wrong, what you are trying to do.

829
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:45,738
Musha's price is an insult
to five generations of our family.

830
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:49,492
And if you die?

831
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,578
Then will the price be high enough?

832
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,583
-l have no choice.
-Why?

833
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,587
He is your father too.

834
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,266
l finally understand it now, Trix.

835
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,560
l know why he left us.

836
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:22,233
He was trying to change this rotten
business and they killed him for it.

837
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:38,374
A lot of drivers beIieve that
the hardest part of Cristo is the start.

838
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:41,085
The Muqranna?
Yeah, those archways are tricky.

839
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:44,421
And speaking of starts,
here comes the queen of Casa Cristo now.

840
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:49,593
The moment the queen sees the sun,
she'll signal the start.

841
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:54,306
No, no, no.
This is supposed to be my race.

842
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,141
l'm supposed to win.

843
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,435
l got the green light.

844
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,231
They promised l would
go to the Grand Prix.

845
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:05,150
For eight years' l played by the rules!

846
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,362
-This is supposed to be my race!
-Enough!

847
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,656
l can't stand the whining.

848
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:13,200
Like a baby needing its diaper changed.

849
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,495
lt's simple.

850
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,164
We have a team of wild cards.

851
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:24,336
The problem is, these wild cards
are better drivers than you.

852
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,840
What? Like hell they are!

853
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,383
Prove it.

854
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,554
Take out Taejo
and the other two will quit.

855
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,516
You just watch me.

856
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,436
Come on!

857
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,024
l got Racer.

858
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,726
This team Taejo Togokahn's put together
looks like they mean business.

859
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,946
As they head out of the city
and into the Zunubian Desert. . .

860
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:17,282
. ..the team leading the pack
is Snake Oiler!

861
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,035
Let's pinch these turds off.

862
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,874
Come on! We are falling behind!

863
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:34,383
Speed! On your right, Flying Foxes!

864
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:36,635
Got them.

865
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,488
Headhunters.

866
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,450
They're not alone.

867
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,880
-Oh' no.
-Speed Racer has a blowout!

868
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,687
Move it, Speed.
lt's getting ugly out there.

869
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,254
Okay, no more Mr. Nice-Guy.

870
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,987
Hurry' Speed, they need you!

871
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,422
Where have you been?

872
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,966
Have any of these drivers
read the rulebook?

873
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,349
See? This race is full of cheaters.

874
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,144
lt's tough to see what goes on
in those dust clouds.

875
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:34,980
It can get really nasty in there.

876
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,445
Watch the backdraft.

877
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:45,616
You want some? Come on!
Thor-Azine' yeah!

878
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,492
Wing leff.

879
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,581
Flying in.

880
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:57,502
-Lead them.
-Here you go.

881
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,005
Ha-ha!

882
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:19,900
Watch the blind side!

883
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,620
Broom Hilda!

884
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:38,377
Crom!

885
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,390
Taojo!

886
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:04,903
-Oh' my God, did l just see that?
-A rear single-set jump into a flying kick.

887
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:08,073
l know he blew up at Fuji,
but this kid is flat-out magic.

888
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:24,423
l'm going into town for some parts.
l'll be back for lunch.

889
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:25,841
Sure thing' Pops.

890
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:29,428
Hm? Mm.

891
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,184
Let's go!

892
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:41,481
-The Togokahn Team is fighting their way. ..
-Game on.

893
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:45,277
...back into the race behind the
electrifying driving of Speed Racer.

894
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,446
The fans are getting their money's worth .

895
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:50,032
Honey' l can't find my wallet.

896
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,658
Spritle!

897
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:54,119
-You two are in big trouble.
-Wait.

898
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,788
Wait, before you get mad at us, look!

899
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,582
l'm not falling for that.

900
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,293
-lt's Speed!
-Speed's skiing!

901
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,378
Then Who's driving the Mach 5?

902
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,797
--relentless as the eight remaining teams. . .

903
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,759
.. .slice their way through
the aqueducts of Sassicaia.

904
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:11,470
Oh' no.

905
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:15,515
As we near the end of the first leg of
the Casa Cristo' one team has dominated.

906
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:19,686
And here they come through the streets
of Cortega' heading for the finish.

907
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,443
Yeah!

908
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:44,002
lf we drive tomorrow like we drove today,
we will lose!

909
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,380
You will get nothing.

910
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:49,758
All of this will be meaningless!

911
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:53,595
Relax. Snake's weak on turns.
We'll catch him in the mountains.

912
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,847
We might, if you stop showing off.

913
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:59,810
Hey, all l was doing was saving your ass.

914
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,772
Don't fall apart yet.

915
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,817
There's still a lot of race to run.

916
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:17,744
A C.l.B. man will be posted
outside your door.

917
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:22,749
We got their attention today. You and Trixie
should be very careful tonight.

918
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,293
Racer X.

919
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,963
l thought we made a good team today.

920
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:32,175
lt felt like we've been doing it
for a long time.

921
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,387
lf you say so.

922
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:43,270
Ineptitude . Is this what I pay you for?!

923
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,230
They ain't checkered yet.

924
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:50,360
lf they do, l assure you it'll be
a very costly mistake for everyone.

925
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:52,904
lt was very weird' Trix.

926
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:57,242
l knew every move he was gonna make
and he knew mine. lt was so familiar.

927
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:03,081
Maybe l'm crazy, but Racer X first
showed up two years affer Rex's death.

928
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,250
But' Speed, we buried Rex.

929
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:09,713
A body was buried. Remember' it had
already been badly burned in the crash.

930
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:12,507
Even if it was Rex'
no one could have recognized him.

931
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:18,346
So you think he faked the crash with
a different body in the driver's seat?

932
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,183
Somehow the kwik-save
was disconnected.

933
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:26,605
lnspector Detector suspected foul play,
but nothing could be proved.

934
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:33,278
Do you really think Rex
could put everyone through all that?

935
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:39,117
Maybe he felt
he didn't have any other choice.

936
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,706
l'm sorry to disturb you, sir,
but do you know these people?

937
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,130
Yeah.

938
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,634
ls this the kind of driver l have?

939
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,969
Someone who disobeys?
Someone who lies to me?

940
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:00,847
ls this the kind of son l've raised?

941
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:02,724
And you' Trixie.

942
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,977
You know what this race
did to this family.

943
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:08,480
Did either of you
stop and think about us?

944
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:12,651
That's all l've been thinking about' Pops.
You' Mom, Spritle' Sparky.

945
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,820
Yeah, you too, Chim Chim.

946
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,740
We're in serious trouble' Pops,
and it's all my fault.

947
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:21,493
This is not the place or race
to do anything about that.

948
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:24,412
-Why not?
-Because it won't do any good.

949
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,622
You don't know that.

950
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:30,001
You think you can drive a car and change
the world? lt doesn't work like that.

951
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:33,421
Maybe not.

952
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:37,133
But it's the only thing l know how to do'
and l gotta do something.

953
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:41,137
That's unacceptable. This is over.
Pack your things. We're going home.

954
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,935
l can't.

955
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,645
l'm sorry, Pops.

956
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:50,981
What?

957
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,192
-l'm staying.
-So am l.

958
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:58,530
No, you're not.
We're going home right now!

959
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:03,118
l'm not a child' Pops.
You can't tell me how to live my life.

960
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:05,954
lf you wanna fire me as your driver,
then' fine, do it.

961
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:09,374
But it won't change the fact
that l am going to finish this race.

962
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:13,837
God, you sound like Rex! You wanna die
like him too? Will that make you happy?

963
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:16,715
Don't take it out on me
because you feel guilty for Rex!

964
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,842
Okay, you two, that's enough.

965
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:22,971
Pops. lf they're staying' we're staying.

966
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,723
Woo-hoo! Room service!

967
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:29,811
And l suggest that we all find a way
to go home together.

968
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:38,069
-Where's the Mach 5?
-Logged with security.

969
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:41,740
-You added something to it, didn't you?
-Some defensive modifications.

970
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,492
Whole thing's out of balance, isn't it?

971
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,163
lt pulls left, rides a little stiff.

972
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,540
-Mmm. Sparky!
-Huh?

973
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,007
l'm sorry, Mom.

974
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:03,762
Your father loves you. lt's just--

975
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,388
l know.

976
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:08,933
lt's gonna be okay.

977
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,437
You wouldn't lie to your mother'
would you??

978
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:14,731
Never again.

979
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:26,154
l got him, Speed! l got him! l got him!

980
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:34,746
Still got him!

981
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,465
Speed!

982
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:53,431
Attack!

983
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,268
Hi-ya!

984
01:20:58,604 --> 01:20:59,812
What's going on out there?

985
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:22,919
Uh-oh.

986
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,756
Ooh!

987
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:28,883
You attack my family.

988
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,427
You try to hurt my sons.

989
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,682
Here we go!

990
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:39,102
What's going--?

991
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:44,566
Whoa.

992
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,628
Oh' my God. Was that a ninja?

993
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:09,799
More like a non-ja.
Terrible what passes for a ninja these days.

994
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,385
Cool beans.

995
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:18,641
Oh' l'm sorry.
l was looking for Speed Racer.

996
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,103
Horuko. Are you all right?

997
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,606
No. Something terrible has happened.

998
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:28,985
Narcolyte benzamine.

999
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,946
A highly effective and debilitating drug.

1000
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:34,741
Stays in the system for hours,
but leaves with no trace.

1001
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:37,452
l'll be fine by morning.

1002
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:41,372
No, you won't. You can't drive a car.
You can barely stand up.

1003
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:47,337
You do not tell me what l can do.

1004
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:48,755
Taojo.

1005
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:53,551
What are we gonna do?

1006
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:00,642
The second leg
of the Casa Cristo is under way. . .

1007
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,644
.. .and the stage is set
for what might be ...

1008
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,605
...one of the most ferocious rallies
we've seen in years.

1009
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:07,565
This is my race.

1010
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:16,574
She's leaving the hotel now.

1011
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:22,413
Wicked sidewinder coming up.
Watch the inside-out, could get dicey.

1012
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,750
Watch your line!

1013
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,044
Watch it!

1014
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:29,587
This is abso--

1015
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,047
--lutely crazy.

1016
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:36,052
Yeah, boss. Signal's loud and clear.

1017
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,939
Don't do it! On the ground! Now!

1018
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,028
Gotcha.

1019
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:01,077
What the--?

1020
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:06,582
You cheater!

1021
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:11,587
lf you're here' who's...?

1022
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:17,301
That's better. l couldn't see a thing.

1023
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,431
That's it. Nice line, Trix.

1024
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,143
Top of the hill's coming up. Snake's
got about a quarter of a mile on you.

1025
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,477
All right. Let's get him.

1026
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:29,188
lf you'd been more careful'
he wouldn't be ahead.

1027
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:32,442
l told you' l couldn't see a thing
out of this dang helmet.

1028
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:37,488
l can't believe you talked us into
this ridiculous idea.

1029
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:39,490
What's ridiculous about it?

1030
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:42,618
You're always saying
l'm a better driver than most of the WRL.

1031
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:45,121
-Now's not the time to prove it.
-Why not?

1032
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:46,789
lt's too dangerous.

1033
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:49,000
lt's too dangerous for me'
but not for you.

1034
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:50,501
Children, focus.

1035
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:54,589
lf we're going to have a chance' we'll
have to pass Snake before the rendezvous.

1036
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:57,175
l'm ready. Let's roll.

1037
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:08,519
Woo-hoo! Go get them' girl!

1038
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,314
Here they come. Let's pick it up!

1039
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:19,238
-Take him.
-With pleasure.

1040
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:22,074
Bring it on!

1041
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,119
Come on!

1042
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:37,840
Now the gloves are off and they're pounding
one another, bumper to bumper' rail to rail.

1043
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:47,725
Take that, Togokahn!

1044
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,898
You're going down!

1045
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,372
-Oh' yeah!
-That's my boy!

1046
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,751
Oh' God. Speed.

1047
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:17,755
Please! Please! Please!

1048
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,425
Oh' please! Please! Aah!

1049
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:26,556
The Togokahn Team roars into the lead...

1050
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:29,392
. ..behind some very aggressive driving
by Speed Racer.

1051
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,686
You kidding?
He just tore Snake a new tailpipe.

1052
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,771
Trix, you all right?

1053
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:36,107
Ten-four. Ready for more .

1054
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:38,776
Then let's move it.
We've got some time to eat up.

1055
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:44,115
You're sure' no cameras here?

1056
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:48,035
No, l checked it this morning. There's quite
a few dead spots in these mountains.

1057
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,714
What's he doing here?

1058
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:02,758
Stowaway.
We weren't sure what to do with him.

1059
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:05,928
Do what he'd do.
Break his legs and let him walk back.

1060
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:12,351
-Thank you so much.
-lt was a blast.

1061
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:14,896
-The cell's reloaded.
-Let's go!

1062
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,105
Good luck.

1063
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,321
Nobody move.

1064
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,990
Waiting for the Togokahn Team
to come out of the pass.

1065
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:28,743
Those roads can really ice up.
Very dangerous.

1066
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:31,579
-What is this?
-This. . .

1067
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,915
. ..is called a change of plan.

1068
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,833
Yeah, that's right.

1069
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:41,505
We're changing your plan that changed
our plan to change your plan.

1070
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:43,382
Right, boss?

1071
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,885
The new plan, what was it?

1072
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:50,139
"Break your legs and make you walk back."
l like that.

1073
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:54,143
But first, it's time to play
a little game of peekaboo. ..

1074
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,812
. ..l see you.

1075
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:07,281
-Ow!
-Monkey cookie!

1076
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,992
-Nice shot!
-Spritle?

1077
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,372
Get that monkey!

1078
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:32,765
Whoa!

1079
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:39,563
Ah? Ha!

1080
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:41,232
Aw!

1081
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:53,995
Nyah! Nyah!

1082
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:23,065
Nobody messes with Spark--

1083
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:35,786
Huh?

1084
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:54,764
Looks like another change of plan.

1085
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,978
Take him away, boys.

1086
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,065
Spritle!

1087
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,697
Go! Go, go!

1088
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:13,574
No.

1089
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:15,493
Oh' no' you don't. You're in big trouble.

1090
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:17,995
First out of the pass is. ..

1091
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:20,247
. ..the Hydra-Cell Team.

1092
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:22,625
Uh-oh. They better send
the emergency trailer.

1093
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,710
Wait, is that--?

1094
01:30:25,504 --> 01:30:26,545
Here we go again.

1095
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:29,799
Whatever happened in that pass
left Togokahn where they started. ..

1096
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:34,470
. ..but now only one obstacle stands
between Snake Oiler and victory.

1097
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:36,764
The Maltese lce Caves.

1098
01:30:41,812 --> 01:30:43,979
This is where Rex cr--

1099
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,788
Speed' what are you doing?

1100
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:02,957
-Are you all right?
-l'm fine.

1101
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:10,881
This next cave's a rattler.
We'll make our move in there.

1102
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:15,970
Now.

1103
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:36,031
Ah, not this time, punk.

1104
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:49,753
Yahoo!

1105
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,380
Speed!

1106
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:59,263
Bye-bye' little turd. Ha-ha-ha!

1107
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:20,284
He did not! He did not just do that!

1108
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,120
Speed Racer is driving straight up
a cliff face. Are we getting this?

1109
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,220
-Come on!
-Go' Speed, go!

1110
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:42,431
-Hi. Remember me?
-No way.

1111
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:58,697
No, no, no! Not again! Not again!

1112
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:00,491
Gun!

1113
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:33,023
Snake Oiler completely
going out of his mind!

1114
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:35,442
Could have been altitude sickness.
lt gets crazy.

1115
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,528
Speed handled it beautifully.

1116
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,154
And with less than
250 kilometers to go. . .

1117
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:42,533
. ..nothing seems to stand
between Togokahn. ..

1118
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:44,535
.. .and victory.

1119
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,212
Whoo!

1120
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:11,186
Get me Tetsua Togokahn.

1121
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,230
Whoo!

1122
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,488
Thank you?.

1123
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:24,908
Whoo!

1124
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:27,703
We make a good team.

1125
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:33,667
We did our part. Make sure you do yours.

1126
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:35,502
Of course.

1127
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:40,424
Congratulations' Mr. Togokahn.

1128
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:43,719
-Very impressive race.
-Yes, thank you.

1129
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:46,263
You're very generous, Mr. Royalton.

1130
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:50,267
Here's Speed. Does this mean
you've signed with Togokahn?

1131
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:55,439
Uh, no, this was
a mutually beneficial opportunity.

1132
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,024
Yes. Well put.

1133
01:34:57,192 --> 01:35:01,236
Taojo, will you be running
in the Grand Prix this weekend?

1134
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:06,575
We'll see. Right now
l'm just going to enjoy this victory.

1135
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:08,952
Whoo!

1136
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:14,708
The price is 78 a share.

1137
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,920
That's outrageous.

1138
01:35:18,088 --> 01:35:21,882
The price is barely above 50 .
This is extortion, blackmail.

1139
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:26,845
l'll sue you, tie up every asset you own
for the next 20 years.

1140
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:29,848
As you wish, Mr. Royalton.
Have a nice day--

1141
01:35:30,016 --> 01:35:31,642
Wait.

1142
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:36,563
Seventy-eight a share.

1143
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:41,151
l'll have the paperwork drawn up.

1144
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:44,405
A pleasure doing business with you.

1145
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:50,077
You have done very well for us, my son.

1146
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:03,298
-l don't get it. What just happened?
-Togokahn played us for chumps.

1147
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:06,385
He wanted our help to drive up
the stock in his family business.

1148
01:36:06,553 --> 01:36:08,971
Even if he had a file'
he wouldn't turn it over.

1149
01:36:09,139 --> 01:36:10,681
You mean the whole race
was for nothing?

1150
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,814
X?

1151
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:03,650
Racer X.

1152
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:05,694
Racer X!

1153
01:37:13,578 --> 01:37:17,873
Jesus, kid, you can drive.
l haven't been thrown like that in years.

1154
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:19,708
What are you doing here?

1155
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:23,921
The inspector told me what happened.
l came looking for you.

1156
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:25,756
Why would you care?

1157
01:37:25,924 --> 01:37:28,550
Because you're a fighter and a friend.

1158
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:32,679
Why don't you just tell me the truth?

1159
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:36,558
-You're Rex, aren't you?
-You mean your brother?

1160
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:41,897
You first appeared two years after Rex died.
You drive just like him.

1161
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:46,193
You knew l'd be here, because this is
where he always used to take me.

1162
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:47,945
Just tell me the truth.

1163
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:05,546
You're not Rex.

1164
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,257
No, Speed.

1165
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:11,468
l'm sorry, but your brother is dead.

1166
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:18,225
-l'm sorry.
-Don't be.

1167
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:22,062
l'm sure if he was here,
he'd be immensely proud of you?.

1168
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,022
For what?

1169
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:25,983
Making the same mistakes he did?

1170
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,068
For trying to make a difference.

1171
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:30,404
From what l've read'
that's all he tried to do.

1172
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:34,491
And what good did it do?
He got killed for nothing.

1173
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:37,119
Racing hasn't changed and it never will.

1174
01:38:37,287 --> 01:38:39,830
lt doesn't matter if racing never changes.

1175
01:38:39,998 --> 01:38:43,000
What matters is if
we let racing change us.

1176
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:49,131
Everyone has to find a reason to do this.
You don't climb into a T-180 to be a driver.

1177
01:38:49,299 --> 01:38:51,133
You do it because you're driven.

1178
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:55,387
lf you know so much, why don't you
tell me why l should keep driving?

1179
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:56,805
Sorry.

1180
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:59,349
That's for you to figure out.

1181
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:04,688
l just hope when you do...

1182
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:07,232
. ..that l'm there to see it.

1183
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:19,953
-What you doing?
-What's it look like?

1184
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:22,331
Where you going?

1185
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:25,042
l don't know.
l just gotta get away from here .

1186
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:32,007
-Can I come with you, Rex?
-What?

1187
01:39:32,175 --> 01:39:33,884
Can we come with you?

1188
01:39:36,346 --> 01:39:38,639
-No.
-Why not?

1189
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:49,107
You'll understand when it's your turn.

1190
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:53,487
Speed.

1191
01:39:55,573 --> 01:40:00,202
Before you go' l'd like to say a few things.
Will you sit with your old man for a minute?

1192
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:04,706
-Don't try to stop me.
-l won't.

1193
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:16,551
Speed' l want you to know
l acted rashly.

1194
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:18,553
l said things l wish l hadn't.

1195
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:22,265
Your mother usually protects me
from making an ass out of myself. . .

1196
01:40:22,433 --> 01:40:26,436
. ..but l was determined to do it this time,
and l guess l did a pretty good job of it.

1197
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:30,565
l just wanted to make sure
you understood how sorry l was.

1198
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:32,192
Thanks.

1199
01:40:32,402 --> 01:40:35,529
The truth was l couldn't have been
more proud of you, son.

1200
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:39,574
Not because you won, but because
you stood up, you weren't afraid.. .

1201
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:42,202
. ..and you did what you thought
was right.

1202
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:45,872
lt didn't amount to anything.
lt was completely meaningless.

1203
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,458
How could it be meaningless?

1204
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:51,378
l saw my son become a man.

1205
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:53,672
l watched him act
with courage and integrity. . .

1206
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,591
. ..and drive the pants off
every other driver on that road.

1207
01:40:56,759 --> 01:41:00,595
This is not meaningless.
This is a reason for a father's life.

1208
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:05,517
l went to Cortega because l was
afraid what happened to Rex. . .

1209
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:08,478
. ..was gonna happen to you,
and l just couldn't take that.

1210
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:10,981
But what l realized at Cortega. ..

1211
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:15,110
. ..was l didn't lose Rex when he crashed.
l lost him here.

1212
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:20,407
l let him think that a stupid motor company
meant more to me than he did.

1213
01:41:21,993 --> 01:41:25,078
He'll never know
how much l regret that mistake.

1214
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:28,457
lt's enough l'll never make it again.

1215
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:34,171
Speed' l understand that
every child has to leave home. . .

1216
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:37,507
. ..but l want you to know'
that door is always open.

1217
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:39,176
You can always come back.

1218
01:41:40,887 --> 01:41:42,846
Because l love you.

1219
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:47,142
l love you, Pops.

1220
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:55,066
l'm just so confused right now.

1221
01:41:55,693 --> 01:42:01,323
l feel like l'm caught in some kind of
a tailspin and no direction makes sense.

1222
01:42:01,491 --> 01:42:03,658
Yeah, l know what you mean.

1223
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:09,414
When Rex died, l didn't know if l wanted
salt on my eggs' let alone keep building cars.

1224
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:14,044
But then. . . . You remember that night. . .

1225
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:18,715
. ..we sat together, we watched old Ben
Burns and Stickleton? You remember that?

1226
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:22,177
That night, something just clicked.

1227
01:42:22,345 --> 01:42:25,680
Like a light being switched on
inside of me.

1228
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:29,226
After that' l never had trouble
remembering how l liked my eggs.

1229
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:34,064
Jeez' Pops, that's just it.
That's part of my problem.

1230
01:42:34,482 --> 01:42:35,899
-What?
-That race. . .

1231
01:42:36,234 --> 01:42:38,527
. ..the 43 Prix.

1232
01:42:38,945 --> 01:42:41,863
Burns and Stickleton? lt was fixed.

1233
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:44,574
Royalton told me the whole story.

1234
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:47,869
lt was all about some DNF named Potts.

1235
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:52,332
They've known the winner of every Grand
Prix for the past 50 years. lt's always fixed.

1236
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:54,084
Pfft!

1237
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:59,005
l don't believe that. Royalton's a crook.
You can't believe a crook.

1238
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,258
l don't think he was lying' Pops.

1239
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:04,261
The Grand Prix, a sham?

1240
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:12,227
-Horuko.
-Forgive me for intruding. . .

1241
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:14,563
. ..but l had to come
before it was too late.

1242
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:16,439
This is not a trick.

1243
01:43:17,275 --> 01:43:19,776
l swear to you. l'm not my brother.

1244
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:22,821
You gonna ask the lovely lady in?

1245
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:27,117
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1246
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:31,246
-Can l get you something to drink?
-No.

1247
01:43:31,414 --> 01:43:33,790
My security man believes
l'm still at the opera. . .

1248
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,376
. ..so l only have a moment.

1249
01:43:37,587 --> 01:43:39,671
l'm very sorry for what happened.

1250
01:43:39,839 --> 01:43:43,592
What my father and brother did
was not right, and l'm ashamed.

1251
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:47,053
lt's fine. Just another lesson learned.

1252
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:50,640
No. lt is they
who are in need of a lesson.

1253
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:53,685
This rightfully belongs to you.

1254
01:43:58,482 --> 01:44:01,818
An invitation to compete
in the 91st annual Grand Prix.

1255
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:05,822
My brother was planning to decline anyway.
But l studied the rules very carefully.

1256
01:44:06,157 --> 01:44:08,283
And as a member of
the winning Togokahn Team. . .

1257
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:13,204
. ..if you present this invitation on the day of
the race' they must allow you to compete.

1258
01:44:13,831 --> 01:44:17,167
Ha! What do you think of that,
Mr. lt's-Always-Fixed?

1259
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:20,086
-l--
-You don't have to say anything.

1260
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,839
l only hope you drive
as you did in Casa Cristo. . .

1261
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:25,300
. ..and you wipe the smiles
from their faces.

1262
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,344
We don't have a car.

1263
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:31,014
-Sparky!
-No. No. He'll yell at me!

1264
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:35,894
-Right here, Pops.
-What are you doing in the kitchen?

1265
01:44:36,062 --> 01:44:38,021
Same as everyone else.

1266
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:43,610
l don't believe it.
You were listening the whole time?

1267
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:46,863
-And l'm so glad l did.
-We were so worried about you.

1268
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,366
Horuko.

1269
01:44:50,201 --> 01:44:51,451
Thank you.

1270
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:54,871
l would say' "Good luck Saturday"'
but you don't need it.

1271
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:58,291
You're already very lucky
to have such a family.

1272
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:02,504
-Come on, we got work to do.
-The race is less than two days away.

1273
01:45:02,672 --> 01:45:06,049
How fast did Royalton say he could build
that tin can with his machines?

1274
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:07,217
Thirty-six hours.

1275
01:45:07,385 --> 01:45:10,595
Then we'll do it in 32. Come on' let's go.

1276
01:46:06,027 --> 01:46:07,610
Cameraman.

1277
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:35,388
Ladies and gentlemen, behold the future!

1278
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,728
Sparky? You ready?

1279
01:46:43,481 --> 01:46:45,148
Ready' Pops.

1280
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:50,236
Pops' that's a Bernoulli Convergenator.

1281
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:54,532
Transponder schmonder.
You want real kick' you go Bernoulli.

1282
01:46:57,953 --> 01:47:00,288
Were you here last year?

1283
01:47:00,456 --> 01:47:02,248
-Yes, you were.
-No.

1284
01:47:07,797 --> 01:47:11,508
The Colosseum has begun to fill,
final preparations are under way.

1285
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:14,969
We're expecting the largest television
audience in Grand Prix history.

1286
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:18,348
We've got an incredible lineup
this year, like the Grey Ghost. . .

1287
01:47:18,516 --> 01:47:23,353
. . .Sonic "Boom-boom" Renaldi, Nitro
Venderhoss and The Scarlet Valentine.

1288
01:47:23,521 --> 01:47:24,604
Not to mention C-Ball.

1289
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:27,357
Cannonball Taylor'
fastest Grand Prix seed in history. . .

1290
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:31,319
...driving the new GRX
from Royalton Race Cars.

1291
01:47:45,793 --> 01:47:48,545
-Thanks, doll.
-You're welcome.

1292
01:47:48,712 --> 01:47:52,048
We've got an odd-numbered field
this year, one shy of a fulI boat. . .

1293
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:57,387
.. .as Taejo Togokahn declined his automatic
invitation after winning the Casa Cristo.

1294
01:48:01,058 --> 01:48:03,059
All right, let's start her up.

1295
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,064
Sounds beefy' Pops.

1296
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:11,025
Yeah, l gave it a little something extra.

1297
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:15,196
Come on, let's load it up.

1298
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:19,117
Hold on.
Something's going on over there .

1299
01:48:19,285 --> 01:48:22,495
We're seeing some kind of commotion
down at the trailer entrance.

1300
01:48:28,294 --> 01:48:30,211
Excuse me.

1301
01:48:31,422 --> 01:48:33,089
ls there a problem here' officer?

1302
01:48:35,384 --> 01:48:38,052
Why' you sly dog.

1303
01:48:38,387 --> 01:48:41,264
Sir, we have a problem.

1304
01:48:41,599 --> 01:48:43,266
Excuse me.

1305
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:45,643
What madness is going on here?

1306
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:49,564
Mr. Royalton' this is a legitimate invitation.
We have verified it.

1307
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:55,195
-Where did you get this?
-l won it fair and square.

1308
01:48:56,447 --> 01:48:59,490
This is preposterous. He can't
be allowed to race. lt's too late.

1309
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:01,784
The ruling on this is clear.
Try to stop it. . .

1310
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:04,704
. ..and you'll be in blatant violation
of the WRL charter. . .

1311
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:07,624
. ..leaving me no option
but to shut this year's Prix down. . .

1312
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:09,959
. ..until a full investigation
can be completed.

1313
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:15,256
What? Have you any idea what
that would cost? Are you insane?

1314
01:49:15,424 --> 01:49:16,466
Try me.

1315
01:49:16,634 --> 01:49:20,470
Something big is going on
because every race official has--

1316
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:23,097
Wait, Wait, an announcement
is being made.

1317
01:49:23,265 --> 01:49:25,600
Now driving in the 40th and final position. . .

1318
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:26,893
Holy shit!

1319
01:49:27,269 --> 01:49:31,314
. . .for Racer Motors in the Mach 6,
Speed Racer.

1320
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:41,366
A million dollars to the driver
that takes out Racer.

1321
01:49:41,659 --> 01:49:44,494
He won't even get out of the blocks.

1322
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:48,831
l'd prefer him to not even
make it out of the locker room.

1323
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:55,421
We're installing a spearhook in the GRX.

1324
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:58,007
l don't need one to beat that punk.

1325
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,678
A precaution.

1326
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:04,138
As the cars take to the fieId...

1327
01:50:04,306 --> 01:50:08,017
. ..you can feel the anticipation
mounting in the audience.

1328
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:10,353
Something is different.

1329
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:12,313
There's an electricity in the air.

1330
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,524
The presence of Speed Racer. . .

1331
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:18,528
.. .has completely changed the equation.

1332
01:50:33,043 --> 01:50:34,544
How are you feeling?

1333
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:38,589
lt's big.

1334
01:50:41,385 --> 01:50:44,220
That cockpit is the exact same size
it was at Thunderhead.

1335
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:47,348
Right.

1336
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:51,561
l wanna say thank you. . .

1337
01:50:52,438 --> 01:50:55,732
. ..for what could be the most exciting
moment in my whole life.

1338
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:58,067
Couldn't have gotten here without you.

1339
01:51:04,366 --> 01:51:08,119
-l'm looking forward to that cold milk.
-Me too.

1340
01:51:13,709 --> 01:51:17,712
Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines!

1341
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:25,428
The final countdown has begun. . .

1342
01:51:26,013 --> 01:51:28,473
. ..and a stillness
has fallen over this stadium. . .

1343
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:32,477
. ..as all eyes turn to one car.

1344
01:51:39,193 --> 01:51:40,735
Ten.

1345
01:51:44,490 --> 01:51:48,743
This ain't a race' this is a showdown.

1346
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:11,599
Trouble at the start. A misfire traps
Speed Racer' causing a collision.

1347
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:13,101
Uh-oh. Look out.

1348
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:22,652
Ooh, that kid is Wily!

1349
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:24,737
I don't know how he got out of that one .

1350
01:52:58,355 --> 01:52:59,939
Nice, nice.

1351
01:53:00,107 --> 01:53:03,818
Speed Racer blows by Katsu
Toppledama, charging into the Moguls.

1352
01:53:04,445 --> 01:53:06,195
He's taking on all comers.

1353
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:08,573
Kelly Kellencoff makes a move,
cuts him off!

1354
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:11,451
Ah , big mistake!
Speed fakes left, jumps right.

1355
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:13,369
He slips in behind Gearbox.

1356
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:15,621
Here comes over-under.

1357
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:24,714
l told you! l told you!

1358
01:53:24,882 --> 01:53:29,719
Speed Racer seems unstoppable' moving up
from dead last, nearing the leaders.

1359
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:35,850
Go' Speed, go!

1360
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:22,355
But look out. As they approach
the Big Drop, here comes Speed Racer.

1361
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:08,818
Speed Racer is knocking on the door
of Cannonball Taylor.

1362
01:55:08,986 --> 01:55:11,487
"Yoo-hoo, anybody home?"

1363
01:55:14,825 --> 01:55:19,537
Okay, Mr. Two-Time-Grand-Prix-
Five-Time-WRL-Future-Hall-of-Fame. . .

1364
01:55:19,705 --> 01:55:21,080
. ..teach me something.

1365
01:55:28,088 --> 01:55:29,380
You ready?

1366
01:55:29,548 --> 01:55:31,299
-Ha-ha.
-Let's go.

1367
01:55:41,143 --> 01:55:42,935
Get that weak shit off my track.

1368
01:55:53,572 --> 01:55:55,031
Come on, that move is weak.

1369
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:00,494
Cannonball Taylor's in trouble.

1370
01:56:05,375 --> 01:56:07,585
Tear him up' kid' tear him up.

1371
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:22,141
Come on, is that all you got?

1372
01:56:30,776 --> 01:56:33,653
Lesson's over. See you at the finish line.

1373
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:38,824
Do it. Stop him. Stop him now.

1374
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:48,876
-Oh' no.
-What is it?

1375
01:56:49,044 --> 01:56:51,170
Spearhook! He's got me.

1376
01:56:52,422 --> 01:56:56,467
Cannonball has Speed pinned
as they grind through the butterfIy turn.

1377
01:56:56,635 --> 01:57:00,096
That cheater. He's using a spearhook!

1378
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:43,055
Cannonball clearly using a spearhook.

1379
01:57:43,265 --> 01:57:44,974
That could cost him the hall of fame.

1380
01:57:45,142 --> 01:57:47,226
Not to mention what it'll do
to Royalton lndustries.

1381
01:57:47,394 --> 01:57:48,811
Shame on them.

1382
01:57:55,444 --> 01:57:57,737
Oh' no' no' no' don't do this!

1383
01:57:57,904 --> 01:58:02,074
-The Triple Phase Conductor's fried.
-Sparky, get me back in this race .

1384
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:07,913
-What's wrong?
-The crash must've dislodged the main conductor.

1385
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:09,123
Starter's overloaded.

1386
01:58:14,171 --> 01:58:17,673
-The nickelhydrate cells are hemorrhaging.
-What do l do?

1387
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:19,633
Don't panic.

1388
01:58:20,177 --> 01:58:22,762
Just listen, Speed. Just listen to her.

1389
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:26,599
-lf l could defibrillate the--
-Shh. Sparky. Give me a second.

1390
01:58:30,854 --> 01:58:32,146
ls there anything he can do?

1391
01:58:32,314 --> 01:58:34,857
l ran a patch through the starter
to the Convergenator.

1392
01:58:35,025 --> 01:58:37,943
lf he puts the car in fiffh gear'
he could jump-start it.

1393
01:58:38,111 --> 01:58:39,236
Will he know that?

1394
01:58:41,656 --> 01:58:42,782
Would Sparky?

1395
01:58:47,329 --> 01:58:49,288
What do you need?

1396
01:59:05,055 --> 01:59:06,138
He's back in it!

1397
01:59:12,687 --> 01:59:13,604
Come on, kid, move it!

1398
01:59:17,275 --> 01:59:18,567
He's gonna do it.

1399
01:59:19,653 --> 01:59:21,403
I don't know why I'm doing it anymore.

1400
01:59:21,571 --> 01:59:24,406
You don't climb into a T-180
to be a driver.

1401
01:59:24,741 --> 01:59:27,201
You do it because you're driven.

1402
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:29,954
Racing has nothing to do
with cars or drivers.

1403
01:59:30,121 --> 01:59:32,122
You ready to put away your toys
and grow up?

1404
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:34,583
Are you ready to become
a real race car driver?

1405
01:59:36,253 --> 01:59:40,214
Look at the split.
He's shattering the lap record.

1406
01:59:40,382 --> 01:59:43,259
If you know so much,
tell me why I should keep driving.

1407
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:44,927
That's for you to figure out.

1408
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:47,429
I just hope when you do. . .

1409
01:59:48,265 --> 01:59:49,765
. ..that l'm there to see it.

1410
01:59:56,898 --> 01:59:59,608
When I watch you do
some of the things you do. ..

1411
02:00:02,779 --> 02:00:04,613
. ..when you just take my breath away.

1412
02:00:12,747 --> 02:00:13,831
You remember that night?

1413
02:00:13,999 --> 02:00:16,959
We sat together, we watched
old Ben Burns and Stickleton.

1414
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:18,878
That night, something just. . .

1415
02:00:19,504 --> 02:00:20,921
. ..clicked.

1416
02:00:29,973 --> 02:00:32,725
Racing hasn't changed and it never will.

1417
02:00:38,106 --> 02:00:41,358
It doesn't matter
if racing never changes. What matters.. .

1418
02:00:41,526 --> 02:00:43,569
. ..is if we let racing change us.

1419
02:00:48,742 --> 02:00:53,078
When I'm in a T-180, I don't know,
everything just makes sense.

1420
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:56,498
No hesitation. Nothing fazes him.

1421
02:00:56,666 --> 02:00:58,626
No one seems capabIe of stopping him.

1422
02:00:58,793 --> 02:00:59,835
He's on a mission.

1423
02:01:00,003 --> 02:01:02,504
With a quarter-lap to go,
Speed Racer is back.

1424
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:06,342
Two cars between him and destiny.

1425
02:01:06,509 --> 02:01:09,511
Stop him!

1426
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:11,805
Here we go again.

1427
02:01:27,948 --> 02:01:29,031
Yes!

1428
02:01:48,802 --> 02:01:50,344
Speed Racer!

1429
02:02:54,951 --> 02:02:59,204
It's pandemonium.
People here have gone completely crazy.

1430
02:02:59,497 --> 02:03:02,541
ln 14 years, we've never
seen anything like this.

1431
02:03:02,834 --> 02:03:06,086
lt's a whole new world, baby.
lt's a whole new world.

1432
02:03:43,625 --> 02:03:45,542
He did it.

1433
02:03:46,836 --> 02:03:50,130
-Yes, he did.
-This could change everything.

1434
02:03:51,382 --> 02:03:52,674
lt already has.

1435
02:03:55,512 --> 02:03:59,473
My men are bringing the family down.
Do you wanna go with them?

1436
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:04,061
No.

1437
02:04:06,147 --> 02:04:08,357
Can l ask you a question?

1438
02:04:09,317 --> 02:04:12,820
Did you ever think you made a mistake,
hiding the truth from them?

1439
02:05:01,077 --> 02:05:02,911
lf l did. . .

1440
02:05:04,581 --> 02:05:07,166
. ..it's a mistake l have to live with.

1441
02:05:19,762 --> 02:05:21,096
Whoa!

1442
02:05:21,264 --> 02:05:22,306
Speed!

1443
02:05:44,495 --> 02:05:46,163
Speed!

1444
02:05:50,627 --> 02:05:53,712
Thank you, Speed. l love you' sweetie.

1445
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:56,048
That was so beautiful.

1446
02:05:56,216 --> 02:05:57,633
l'm proud of you, son.

Woo-hoo!

Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!
