1
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:47,427
- It's been almost a year,

2
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:54,334
yet we still know
nothing about them.

3
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:00,755
Who they are,

4
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:02,695
where they come from,

5
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:05,731
why they went down...

6
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:11,942
all we know is, since they came,

7
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,634
two quiet hours a day

8
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:18,811
is all we have.

9
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,652
- What was that?

10
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:50,852
- I'm not sure.

11
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,211
- A gunshot?

12
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,841
- No, it can't be.

13
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,372
- No, I heard an engine.

14
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:57,483
- It could have been anything.

15
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,593
- What if there were
people out there?

16
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:02,680
And they found us?
- It's nothing, Ok?

17
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:14,127
- Would you shoot someone
if you had to?

18
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,398
- Go back to sleep.

19
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:37,730
- What's she saying?

20
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:43,970
- Uh... they've left the UK,

21
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:48,098
and stopped here.

22
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:52,774
And some

23
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,504
country's name I couldn't understand.
- Shh!

24
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:14,839
- Turn it off!

25
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:22,838
- Why?

26
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:28,093
- Because it creeps me out, Ok?

27
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,233
If you go out the back,
make sure to lock the door behind you, Ok?

28
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,350
Is anybody there?

29
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:05,884
- Hello, survivors.

30
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:10,023
Tom Connelly here,
playing just for you.

31
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,793
Dad?

32
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,756
Dad?

33
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:33,596
Who are you?

34
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:59,240
God what is wrong with you? I
told you to shut the door.

35
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:00,253
- I'm sorry.

36
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,239
- That's the second time. Do
you want to get us killed?

37
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:15,995
He's been shot.

38
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:17,323
- Where?

39
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:18,952
- In the leg.

40
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,283
- Could that be what
we heard last night?

41
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:23,947
Sarah?

42
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:27,302
Are you gonna fix his leg?

43
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:29,812
Well, you shouldn't.

44
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:33,418
He stole our food.

45
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,082
- Hold the light closer.

46
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,790
- Is he gonna die?

47
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:48,957
- No.

48
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:51,514
At least no from me hitting him.

49
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,222
- What is this?

50
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,029
- A survival blanket.

51
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,732
From Manchester.

52
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:21,465
Twenty-Seven

53
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:38,895
- What do you see?

54
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:44,024
- One of their mines.

55
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:46,990
Looks incredibly deep.

56
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:50,577
- I heard they're taking minerals
from the core of the planet.

57
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:53,168
Can you see them?

58
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:55,889
- No.

59
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:08,738
<i>- What are we gonna do with him?</i>

60
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,279
<i>- I don't know, I'm thinking.</i>

61
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,360
<i>- We'll have to see what dad
thinks when he gets home?</i>

62
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,066
<i>- Do you think he'll be back tonight?</i>

63
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,059
<i>Sarah?</i>

64
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,456
<i>Oh, for Christ's sake,
how could I possibly know?</i>

65
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,174
- Good girl.

66
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,209
- Coffee?

67
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,184
- There ain't much milk.

68
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:17,188
- It's been a while since
she had babies.

69
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:21,619
- Will she stop producing it?

70
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:24,519
- Eventually.

71
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:32,699
I'm sorry, Ok?

72
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,763
- It must be Dad.

73
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:51,631
- Hello?

74
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:55,834
<i>- You'll catch a fever washing
in that filthy water.</i>

75
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,036
<i>Why did you run away?</i>

76
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,496
<i>I meant you no harm.</i>

77
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:06,102
<i>I suppose you don't see
many people in these parts.</i>

78
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:09,204
<i>It's quite isolated, isn't it?</i>

79
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:20,223
<i>What's your name?</i>

80
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,710
- Sarah.

81
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,012
<i>- You live alone in that big house?</i>

82
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:30,855
- No.

83
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,417
<i>- Who else is there?</i>

84
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:33,607
- My brother.

85
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:35,317
And my father.

86
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,040
<i>- How old are you?</i>

87
00:18:45,218 --> 00:18:46,471
- I'm twenty-five.

88
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,883
<i>- How old are you really?</i>

89
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:51,636
<i>Eighteen?</i>

90
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:53,536
<i>Nineteen?</i>

91
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:56,788
- What do you want?

92
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,861
<i>- He's there, isn't he?</i>

93
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:10,057
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

94
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:12,486
<i>- You're lying to me, Sarah.</i>

95
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:14,817
<i>Did you tie him up?</i>

96
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:17,708
- Sarah...

97
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:18,993
- Shh...

98
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:20,632
<i>- Sarah?</i>

99
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,722
<i>Fine.</i>

100
00:19:35,414 --> 00:19:37,743
- You've got ten minutes to get him out.

101
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,857
Ten minutes.

102
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:46,365
Or big, bad wolf will
be knocking on your door.

103
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:48,427
Over.

104
00:19:58,243 --> 00:19:59,634
- How many are there?

105
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:02,731
- I'm not sure. At least two.

106
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:05,876
I think there night be
more hiding in the back.

107
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,005
- Let's just take him
out as she said.

108
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,710
He must be with them.

109
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:12,509
- Then you tell them
it's just the two of us.

110
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:15,310
And then we'll be screwed.
We might as well kiss our animals goodbye.

111
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:17,664
- He wouldn't know. He's
still knocked out, isn't he?

112
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,402
Come, let's take him out.

113
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:22,430
- So they can invite themselves over?

114
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,215
- We can take him out
through the window, I'll help.

115
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,070
- I imagine they want to kill him.

116
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,814
- So what? He's a thief.

117
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:33,137
- That would be murder.
Sarah, we can't keep him here.

118
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:36,205
What if he breaks free?
It could be dangerous.

119
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:38,018
- What do you suggest?
That we kill him?

120
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:51,105
Come with me.

121
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,116
It's stuck.

122
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:31,471
- Sarah?

123
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:43,769
- I didn't mean to frighten you.

124
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:46,070
- Your friend has already contacted us.

125
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:49,240
- My friend?

126
00:21:49,981 --> 00:21:52,457
- The woman who contacted
me on my CV.

127
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,422
- I'm alone.

128
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:56,945
- Do you think I'm stupid?

129
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:00,786
- They've been following me.

130
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:02,184
- Why?

131
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:05,107
- How did you get here
if you weren't in that van?

132
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:07,983
- I bundled myself inside
survival blankets.

133
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,354
Old ones that the army took out.

134
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,986
They're full of rodents
and asbestos fiber.

135
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:16,854
They work if the patrol
vessels fly high enough.

136
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,761
But it's like playing
Russian roulette.

137
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:20,546
I was lucky.

138
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:27,550
But believe me! These
are not good people.

139
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:32,238
Untie me and I'll protect the house.
- Keep quiet.

140
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:34,232
I don't trust you.

141
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:38,521
- Is it the uniform?

142
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:42,932
- Maybe.
- But I'm not a soldier.

143
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:46,279
I'm a journalist.
- They why are you dressed like one?

144
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,567
- I took the clothes from a dead one.

145
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:51,955
Look in my front pocket.

146
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,993
There's a picture in there.

147
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:56,123
Please take a look at it!

148
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:06,390
- What is it?

149
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,442
- That's my wife and daughter.

150
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:10,259
They're dead.

151
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,634
- So what?

152
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:17,111
Is that suppose to
make you a good man?

153
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,782
- Oh, come on! You
can see that I was shot.

154
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,497
- Could have been an accident.
A self-inflicted wound.

155
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:26,221
- Do you think you can
hold the four alone?

156
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:29,651
You don't know what
they're capable of.

157
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:31,655
They won't stop until
they've got your farm.

158
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,248
- Well, it seems to me
like it's you they want.

159
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:37,934
- No, don't delude yourself.

160
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:41,048
How many farms with
souls and piles

161
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:43,189
of livestock do you
think you can find

162
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:47,630
Please.

163
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:49,616
Untie me.

164
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:52,468
- So you can open the door to your friends?

165
00:23:54,618 --> 00:23:55,913
- You can't beat him alone.

166
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,325
- Our father will be back soon.

167
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:03,871
- Where is he?

168
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:07,308
- He went to town to
get some supplies.

169
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:10,094
- And how soon will he be back?

170
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:13,645
- Soon enough.

171
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:21,329
- How many of them are there?
- Five.

172
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:25,631
Used to be six, but one of
them was killed by the blasters last night.

173
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:27,602
- That must be what we...
- Don't.

174
00:24:27,627 --> 00:24:28,728
- I went inside an abandoned

175
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:30,111
house to look for some food,

176
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,142
and one of them
followed me without cover.

177
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:34,298
I escaped just before the blast.

178
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:37,328
- If what you're telling
me is true, then why are

179
00:24:37,355 --> 00:24:38,931
they trying so hard
to capture you?

180
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:47,386
- You're a liar!

181
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:50,173
- Please.

182
00:24:51,778 --> 00:24:52,891
Let me help you.

183
00:25:04,282 --> 00:25:05,545
No, no!

184
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,445
- What are you doing?
- Shutting him up.

185
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:11,605
- Let him talk, Sarah!
- Be quiet!

186
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:12,106
- I'm gonna go upstairs, Ok?

187
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:55,836
- Knock knock.

188
00:27:56,294 --> 00:27:58,378
Big bad wolf.

189
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:00,648
Keep quiet, bitch.

190
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:03,599
- You need to untie me.

191
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,261
Those guys <i>will</i>
kill your sister.

192
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:09,073
Then they will come down
here and kill me and you.

193
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:10,540
Do you want that to happen?

194
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:20,444
There's a knife

195
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,556
in the side pocket of my bag.

196
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:24,484
Get it for me and let me help.

197
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:27,352
I'm not going to
lie to you, I promise.

198
00:28:55,214 --> 00:28:56,258
Come here.

199
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:02,786
Here.

200
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:05,564
Great. Yeah. Stay there.
No one can see you.

201
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:07,103
You'll be fine.

202
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:19,188
- No!

203
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:43,619
Thanks.

204
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:51,432
- Jeez!

205
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:53,695
Are the other locked?

206
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,243
- No.

207
00:31:57,555 --> 00:31:58,875
- We'll be safe now.

208
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,805
- Tom?
- Sarah?

209
00:32:12,257 --> 00:32:13,299
Are you Ok?

210
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,480
- Yeah.

211
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:17,038
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing.

212
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:24,675
- Your sister's fine.

213
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:29,382
- Did you hear them leave?

214
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:31,855
- I heard an engine.
They moved a van.

215
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,288
- They have broken
into the barn.

216
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,572
- They'll attack us again at sunset.

217
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:51,222
- That's how everyone
left is killed.

218
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:10,722
You've done a good
job cleaning up my leg.

219
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:14,965
You a nursing student?

220
00:33:15,938 --> 00:33:17,396
- Something like that.

221
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:33,023
Tell me what you did to them.

222
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,741
Tell me the truth.

223
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:43,750
- I killed one of them.

224
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:46,473
My brother.

225
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:52,689
They killed my wife and daughter.

226
00:33:55,987 --> 00:33:58,854
They broke into the basement
where they were hiding.

227
00:34:00,148 --> 00:34:02,284
My wife tried to defend
what little food we had.

228
00:34:03,987 --> 00:34:05,557
And they killed her.

229
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,893
I came back from a water run

230
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:12,132
and found them carrying
boxes to their van.

231
00:34:13,273 --> 00:34:14,317
And I just hid.

232
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:18,846
I remember her wiping
blood on her pants.

233
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:20,987
Him

234
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:22,418
eating our food.

235
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:24,914
And their brother

236
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:28,775
bragging about what he'd just done.

237
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:34,983
Thought I'd never see him again.

238
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:37,117
Then, a couple of days ago,

239
00:34:37,697 --> 00:34:40,565
I'm riding in a bunker on
the coast and I hear a voice.

240
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:42,951
Their brother's.

241
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,987
I killed him whilst he slept.

242
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,376
Then ran.

243
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:54,800
They've been chasing me ever since.

244
00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:57,952
- And your daughter?

245
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:03,751
- They got her, too.

246
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:34,788
- How do you know he isn't making
up stories to make you feel sorry for him?

247
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,903
- Tom...

248
00:35:36,547 --> 00:35:38,641
- Was <i>he</i> in the picture he showed you?

249
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,740
- No.
- Then you don't know for sure, do you?

250
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,442
- He saved my life.

251
00:35:45,016 --> 00:35:48,208
- Maybe he plays the good
guy till he's done with the people outside.

252
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:51,280
- Look, we're all in this together.

253
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,130
- I'm just saying we
should watch our backs.

254
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,952
He killed a man before your eyes, how do
you know he's not gonna kill us, too?

255
00:35:57,978 --> 00:36:00,769
- How can you judge him so harshly
you can't even see him?

256
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,786
I'm sorry.

257
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,262
I didn't mean it.

258
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:08,364
- That's another five.

259
00:36:09,577 --> 00:36:10,619
Mediocre shot.

260
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:27,492
That's a nice radio.

261
00:36:30,615 --> 00:36:32,630
Who taught you how to use it?

262
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,554
- My father.

263
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:42,206
- Your father sounds like
quite the survivalist.

264
00:36:42,231 --> 00:36:43,737
- He didn't...

265
00:36:45,864 --> 00:36:47,925
He doesn't like to
take things for granted.

266
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,362
He would always be
prepared if we went to ship.

267
00:36:55,864 --> 00:36:58,217
- Did you get your electricity
from the solar power?

268
00:36:58,242 --> 00:37:01,550
- Some. But we save
the batteries for the radio.

269
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:09,483
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

270
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:10,913
<i>Your men will live</i>

271
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:13,168
<i>They keep doing alright</i>

272
00:37:13,673 --> 00:37:15,760
<i>This usually means you're OK</i>

273
00:37:17,663 --> 00:37:22,795
<i>- An unusually big swarm has been
spotted over Bradford heading south.</i>

274
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:29,123
<i>I repeat. An unusually big swarm has been
spotted over Bradford heading south.</i>

275
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,644
<i>They're three quarters advanced</i>

276
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,222
- They're heading our way.

277
00:37:34,737 --> 00:37:36,692
They've been acting
strangely lately.

278
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,050
- What do you mean?

279
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:40,346
- Their patterns have changed.

280
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,809
They'd been drilling like crazy.

281
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,231
Like there's no tomorrow.

282
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:47,405
<i>- It's Jimmy.</i>

283
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:51,909
<i>Don't come back</i>

284
00:37:52,342 --> 00:37:54,036
<i>it's too risky at the moment.</i>

285
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,181
- Tom, why don't you fetch
this bowl of mine?

286
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:33,188
After all, it's been a long
time since we've had a guest.

287
00:38:35,427 --> 00:38:36,471
- Sure.

288
00:38:44,664 --> 00:38:45,706
- I'm sorry.

289
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:48,023
I didn't mean to intrude.

290
00:38:56,092 --> 00:38:57,608
When did Tom lose his sight?

291
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:01,666
- He was flash blinded
the day they came.

292
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:07,565
He was outside feeding
cattle with mum.

293
00:39:09,211 --> 00:39:11,076
All he remembers is this

294
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:13,023
intense light

295
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,061
telling him to run away.

296
00:39:21,047 --> 00:39:22,090
She died.

297
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:25,619
It was the last thing he saw.

298
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:29,885
- And your father?

299
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:32,878
I saw his grave.

300
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:39,358
They got him, didn't they?

301
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,528
I saw a blast a distance
a couple of days ago.

302
00:39:46,422 --> 00:39:48,298
- Is that why you came here?

303
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,360
- I was hoping to find people.

304
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:52,702
Life.

305
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,932
- Yeah, and you've left them to us.

306
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:57,853
- I didn't know they were following me.

307
00:40:00,346 --> 00:40:01,389
I'm sorry.

308
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:08,750
Tom needs to know.

309
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,206
The longer you wait,
the harder it's going to be.

310
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:14,315
- You know what? This is
none of your business.

311
00:40:14,617 --> 00:40:18,579
- So you're gonna keep lying to him?
Give him false hope?

312
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:28,210
- Sorry. It's burnt.

313
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:29,929
We ran out of oil.

314
00:40:44,195 --> 00:40:45,239
Hello?

315
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:49,541
- <i>What's happened to my husband?</i>

316
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,496
<i>Did you kill him?</i>

317
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,163
<i>Well?</i>

318
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:05,847
<i>There's been enough
bloodshed as it is.</i>

319
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:08,275
<i>Release your prisoner
and we'll be square.</i>

320
00:41:11,592 --> 00:41:12,635
- He's gone.

321
00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:15,304
-<i>You're lying</i>

322
00:41:16,045 --> 00:41:17,088
- I'm not.

323
00:41:17,581 --> 00:41:19,887
He cut his ties and escaped.

324
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:23,391
- When?

325
00:41:25,336 --> 00:41:27,748
- A couple of hours ago.
He's probably dead by now.

326
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:31,452
If not, the survival blankets
won't protect him for long.

327
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:36,869
- What did you do with
my husband's body?

328
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:41,963
- He's still with us.

329
00:41:45,322 --> 00:41:48,335
- Take him down at sunset
so we can have a Christian burial.

330
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:51,480
We'll leave the house
as soon as it's done.

331
00:41:52,121 --> 00:41:53,440
<i>You have our word.</i>

332
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:54,931
<i>Over.</i>

333
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:09,164
- What do you think?

334
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:11,610
- I wouldn't believe them.

335
00:42:12,193 --> 00:42:14,246
- She should be allowed
to bury her husband.

336
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:17,992
- That's not what they want him for.

337
00:42:20,777 --> 00:42:22,028
- What do you mean?

338
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,329
- Well, they need to eat to survive.

339
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:39,775
- And what about you?

340
00:42:40,871 --> 00:42:42,891
Have you been eating
dead people, too?

341
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:47,295
- Of course not.

342
00:42:57,965 --> 00:42:59,702
- They gave us their word.

343
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:01,284
- It means nothing.

344
00:43:01,777 --> 00:43:04,407
- It's worth taking a chance.
They might go away.

345
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:06,550
- If what I think
will happen happens,

346
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,675
they will be able to
stay out there for days

347
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:11,592
while we're stuck in here
with no food or water.

348
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:15,387
What do you think, Tom?

349
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:19,510
- I think you need to leave.

350
00:43:19,882 --> 00:43:22,025
- Tom!
- If he left, they'd go!

351
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:23,802
- No, they wouldn't.

352
00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:26,025
They'd come back for the farm.

353
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,123
- We need his help.

354
00:43:28,585 --> 00:43:30,045
- We were fine before he turned up!

355
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:32,951
- <i>He wouldn't make it
out there by himself.</i>

356
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,748
-<i>I don't care if he dies.</i>

357
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,382
- Um...

358
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:44,590
I'm sor-he didn't mean that.

359
00:44:11,186 --> 00:44:12,228
- Are they back?

360
00:44:12,677 --> 00:44:13,719
- Yeah.

361
00:44:14,427 --> 00:44:15,471
She'll call.

362
00:44:21,003 --> 00:44:22,045
- Ok.

363
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:25,130
Will you come with me?

364
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,221
Back in a minute, Ok?

365
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,034
- Ok. Ok.

366
00:45:35,836 --> 00:45:37,074
- We'll be alright.

367
00:46:58,393 --> 00:46:59,436
- You alright?

368
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,213
- Dad should be back by now.

369
00:47:25,266 --> 00:47:27,409
- They thought they
could contain him.

370
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:30,496
If we were without our
satellites we were dine for.

371
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:32,827
The heat.

372
00:47:33,168 --> 00:47:34,210
Snow.

373
00:47:35,538 --> 00:47:37,443
A stench of decaying flesh.

374
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,518
There are no words for it.

375
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:45,175
And soon we'll have no
newspapers to send them to.

376
00:47:46,603 --> 00:47:50,146
So I got back in the car,
drove home faster than I could.

377
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:53,070
- Is there anyone left in cities?

378
00:47:54,025 --> 00:47:55,068
- No.

379
00:47:56,211 --> 00:47:58,353
The blasters didn't
leave them a chance.

380
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:03,630
The old fire blankets,
the solar panels,

381
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:05,628
that just drops in the ocean.

382
00:48:06,382 --> 00:48:10,121
And those who you
love survive to become animals.

383
00:48:12,217 --> 00:48:14,650
They hide in basements or bunkers.

384
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:18,509
They get sick or lose their minds.

385
00:48:23,378 --> 00:48:26,882
- Have you heard of anyone
actually making contact with them?

386
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:28,992
- No. Never.

387
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:31,923
- Well, maybe there isn't anyone.

388
00:48:32,282 --> 00:48:34,458
Maybe they just sent the machines.

389
00:48:34,898 --> 00:48:36,990
- Or maybe they just
don't give a shit about us.

390
00:48:37,545 --> 00:48:41,365
- Is that what you believe?
That they don't care?

391
00:48:41,391 --> 00:48:42,936
- Why would they?

392
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,414
What makes<i> us</i> more special then the

393
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,697
ants or... field mice
or dolphins?

394
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:50,588
- Our art?

395
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:54,822
Our ability to build,
to think about our life in sequences?

396
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:58,097
- Hence build completely
sophisticated colonies.

397
00:48:58,465 --> 00:49:00,159
Birds decorate their nests,

398
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,978
- Yeah, but they don't...

399
00:49:02,003 --> 00:49:04,599
regret, they don't dream,
they don't hope.

400
00:49:06,237 --> 00:49:07,278
- Maybe they do.

401
00:49:07,646 --> 00:49:08,827
Maybe they don't.

402
00:49:11,474 --> 00:49:13,420
- It's probably for the best.

403
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,534
It won't get hard that way.

404
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:21,434
- Tom...

405
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,974
Uh... why don't you
play something for us?

406
00:49:24,188 --> 00:49:25,717
- I don't feel like it.

407
00:49:26,746 --> 00:49:28,659
- Come on, do it for me.

408
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,021
- What should I play?

409
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,510
- What you were playing
over the radio.

410
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,713
- Hello?

411
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:46,393
- You Ok?

412
00:51:52,913 --> 00:51:54,025
- Yeah, I'm fine.

413
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:03,641
You can come in.

414
00:52:20,164 --> 00:52:21,735
- What did you study?

415
00:52:23,626 --> 00:52:24,889
- Veterinary medicine.

416
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,943
First year.

417
00:52:29,434 --> 00:52:31,666
It doesn't matter now,
though, does it?

418
00:52:32,985 --> 00:52:35,331
- You could have studied
English lit, like me.

419
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:39,436
Believe me. You won't
want me sewing your leg up.

420
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,795
What happened to your father?

421
00:52:53,668 --> 00:52:54,710
- I found him.

422
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,322
Yesterday morning.

423
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:00,710
A few yards from here.

424
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,106
He must've been...

425
00:53:07,132 --> 00:53:08,483
...confused.

426
00:53:09,054 --> 00:53:12,067
Maybe his watch stopped, or something.

427
00:53:14,976 --> 00:53:16,018
When he left,

428
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:20,018
I vaguely remember waking up

429
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:25,353
remembering I'd forgotten to
turn off the alarm the night before,

430
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:31,427
telling myself every
way it hadn't rung.

431
00:53:32,972 --> 00:53:35,452
I'd just go straight back to sleep.

432
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:44,298
And when my alarm <i>did</i> go off
a few minutes later,

433
00:53:46,173 --> 00:53:47,217
I got out,

434
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:52,317
and I saw his bike
leaning against a tree.

435
00:53:57,532 --> 00:53:59,576
- And you really think it was a mistake?

436
00:54:04,795 --> 00:54:06,351
- What are you saying?

437
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:09,672
- Maybe...

438
00:54:10,242 --> 00:54:12,385
he just wanted to
get it over with.

439
00:54:18,195 --> 00:54:19,237
- No...

440
00:54:20,297 --> 00:54:22,014
No, my father was a fighter.

441
00:54:23,244 --> 00:54:25,786
He kept saying that
we had to keep going.

442
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,059
That we could never give up...
he wouldn't...

443
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:29,713
Never...

444
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:31,757
- In this world,

445
00:54:34,422 --> 00:54:35,985
people change.

446
00:54:39,065 --> 00:54:41,117
- It was a mistake, Ok?

447
00:54:43,277 --> 00:54:45,385
My father wasn't a coward.

448
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,217
He would... never have
abandoned us like that.

449
00:54:52,204 --> 00:54:55,454
He knew I couldn't protect him alone.

450
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:57,971
- Or maybe he knew you <i>could</i>.

451
00:54:58,724 --> 00:55:00,751
Maybe he thought you
were stronger than him.

452
00:55:02,577 --> 00:55:04,010
You <i>are</i>, Sarah.

453
00:55:07,367 --> 00:55:09,521
You're stronger than you think.

454
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:38,278
- Where were you
when all this started?

455
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:47,532
- Just... grocery shopping with my wife.

456
00:56:50,677 --> 00:56:52,152
We were bickering

457
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:55,706
because I was wasting
money on expensive food and

458
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,755
she was trying to save a few in the summer.

459
00:57:03,552 --> 00:57:05,427
Sounds trivial, doesn't it?

460
00:57:08,976 --> 00:57:10,297
- What was her name?

461
00:57:14,311 --> 00:57:15,355
- Lisa.

462
00:57:19,932 --> 00:57:21,878
Our daughter's name was Marty.

463
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:29,278
She was such a lively
little girl. She was.

464
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:30,590
Dancing around.

465
00:57:33,246 --> 00:57:35,561
Lisa said she could
become a ballerina.

466
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,547
And I remember the last
night before I left them.

467
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:45,047
Marty woke up

468
00:57:47,094 --> 00:57:48,505
She wanted to come with me.

469
00:57:51,992 --> 00:57:54,704
She wouldn't let go
of my hands, as if

470
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:56,813
somehow she knew.

471
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:32,969
- Sarah?

472
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:54,688
Nooooo!

473
01:01:58,728 --> 01:01:59,771
No...

474
01:02:01,762 --> 01:02:02,804
No!

475
01:03:40,246 --> 01:03:41,289
- Oh, shit.

476
01:03:50,802 --> 01:03:51,844
Tom?!

477
01:03:58,092 --> 01:03:59,135
Tom?

478
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:07,240
Tom!

479
01:04:14,385 --> 01:04:15,427
Tom?

480
01:04:16,592 --> 01:04:17,635
Tom?

481
01:04:24,271 --> 01:04:25,932
No... he wouldn't have.

482
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:28,532
- No!

483
01:04:28,556 --> 01:04:30,641
There were too many patrols around.

484
01:04:31,016 --> 01:04:32,545
- He's all I have left!

485
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:41,601
Tom!

486
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:49,992
Tom!

487
01:05:19,565 --> 01:05:20,608
Tom!!

488
01:05:22,025 --> 01:05:23,068
- Tom!

489
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:26,090
- What?

490
01:05:26,775 --> 01:05:28,304
They burned the straw.

491
01:05:30,733 --> 01:05:32,123
- They're still here.

492
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:33,869
Go! Go.

493
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:18,380
- What are you doing?

494
01:06:18,405 --> 01:06:21,215
- There is no asbestos.
We'll be fine.

495
01:07:12,188 --> 01:07:13,231
- Tom!

496
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:35,829
- Sarah! Hey!

497
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:38,974
Tom's alive.

498
01:07:39,568 --> 01:07:40,612
Ok?

499
01:07:42,121 --> 01:07:43,719
Wait. I heard laughing.

500
01:07:57,646 --> 01:07:59,246
- They're in the cellar.

501
01:08:27,945 --> 01:08:28,988
- You alright?

502
01:08:30,324 --> 01:08:31,993
<i>- We need to get him out.</i>

503
01:08:34,952 --> 01:08:36,409
- I'll take him by surprise.

504
01:08:48,872 --> 01:08:50,194
<i>What are you doing?</i>

505
01:08:52,402 --> 01:08:55,106
-<i>He'll sniff them out.</i>

506
01:11:52,269 --> 01:11:53,311
<i>- Tom?</i>

507
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,063
<i>Tom.</i>

508
01:11:56,594 --> 01:11:59,078
<i>Tom, Tom</i>

509
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:02,059
<i>It's me.</i>

510
01:12:54,581 --> 01:12:55,622
- Come on.

511
01:13:36,824 --> 01:13:38,208
- Stay here, Ok?

512
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,430
- She's not here.

513
01:14:14,466 --> 01:14:15,926
I guess they've gone.

514
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:23,003
- Tom?

515
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:43,783
- Get up!

516
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,030
Come over here, boy.

517
01:14:56,247 --> 01:14:57,845
- Why did you shoot him?

518
01:14:58,341 --> 01:14:59,591
There was no need.

519
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,606
- He killed my brother.

520
01:15:01,932 --> 01:15:03,393
- You killed his wife.

521
01:15:03,742 --> 01:15:04,784
- No...

522
01:15:05,746 --> 01:15:07,345
They were already dead.

523
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:09,965
His wife ran to a
death with their child.

524
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:11,797
She just couldn't take it anymore.

525
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,460
We found him scavenging
for tomatoes in the garden.

526
01:15:18,609 --> 01:15:20,220
Took them back to her bunker.

527
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,827
I guess we didn't agree on

528
01:15:23,096 --> 01:15:24,661
what we had to do to survive.

529
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:29,394
You were wrong.

530
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:33,206
And because you wouldn't
listen, you got my husband killed.

531
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:38,055
- He tried to rape me.

532
01:15:40,368 --> 01:15:41,828
- I don't believe you.

533
01:16:00,395 --> 01:16:03,122
<i>It's time for this to end.</i>

534
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,382
- You're going to be Ok.

535
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:08,925
- I just needed you to trust me.

536
01:17:40,846 --> 01:17:41,890
- We need to go.

537
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,560
Come back when it's safe.

538
01:18:35,212 --> 01:18:37,320
- I didn't mean what I said about Jude.

539
01:18:39,896 --> 01:18:40,939
- I know.

540
01:19:05,761 --> 01:19:07,396
<i>- What now?</i>

541
01:20:21,935 --> 01:20:24,439
- Are you sure this is what you want?

542
01:20:36,993 --> 01:20:38,036
- Stop!

543
01:20:46,024 --> 01:20:47,484
Maybe we should wait.

544
01:21:44,425 --> 01:21:45,876
- What happened?

545
01:21:51,363 --> 01:21:52,407
- They're gone.

546
01:22:07,905 --> 01:22:10,270
- They left the same way they came.

547
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,649
Without warning.

548
01:22:17,926 --> 01:22:21,143
Dad used to say as long as
there's hope in our hearts,

549
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:22,373
we'd survive.

550
01:22:25,823 --> 01:22:27,516
He was right.

551
01:22:31,109 --> 01:22:32,153
The end.
