...we want you to be our son.

872
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:33,600
And we hope
you want us for your parents.

873
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,000
We're not perfect, mate...

874
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,100
...but we could love you.

875
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:44,600
MAPS:
Good on you, mate.

876
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,200
Yeah.

877
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,300
Misty's the one, for sure.

878
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:20,400
Well, hey, it's not like
we're never gonna see you again.

879
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,600
I mean, we're sure
to come back and visit...

880
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,400
...and if you're ever in the mood for
some boiled lamb, you can come visit us.

881
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,400
FEARLESS: You boys are gonna come
back and say goodbye before you go?

882
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,600
SPIT:
Oh, no worries.

883
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,800
We'll see him again.

884
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,100
See you, fellas.

885
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,500
Just remember, Misty, no matter what,
you're still a December boy.

886
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,700
Yeah.

887
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,400
- Hey.
SPARKS: Got you.

888
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,500
You're gonna have to run
faster than that.

889
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,900
SPIT:
Hey. Whoo!

890
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,800
SPARKS:
Come get me.

891
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,000
SPIT:
Let's go get some souvenirs.

892
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,500
Get a crab for Sister Edna.

893
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,700
MAPS:
Look at this.

894
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:24,100
Spit. Quick, before it gets away.

895
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,300
MISTY:
I don't want you to be mad at me...

896
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,300
...but I can't stay.

897
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,000
If I was ever gonna be adopted...

898
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:53,600
...you'd be the best parents
I could have, and that's no lie.

899
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:59,500
But I've already got a family.

900
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,000
They'd be lost without me.

901
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,300
FEARLESS:
I know.

902
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:17,000
No hard feelings?

903
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,900
No hard feelings, Misty.

904
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,400
Go on.

905
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,500
MISTY:
Thank you.

906
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,100
SPIT:
Look what I found over here.

907
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,900
SPARKS: Give it back, that's mine.
SPIT: No, I found it.

908
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:40,800
Hey, come on.

909
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,300
Well, lads, this is it.

910
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,900
I thought...

911
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:56,700
...if you wanted a keepsake,
you might like to take the signal flags.

912
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,700
Thanks.

913
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:06,500
The boys would like
to say goodbye, Skipper.

914
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:16,000
MISTY:
Thanks, Skipper.

915
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,300
Thanks.

916
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:23,500
Bless you.

917
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,000
Thanks, Skipper.

918
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,900
Goodbye.

919
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,600
Okay, orphans, disembark.

920
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,200
Left, right, left, right, left, right...

921
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,600
SCULLY:
See you, Bandy.

922
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,100
See you, Father.

923
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,500
- See you, boys.
MAPS: Thank you, Bandy.

924
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,900
MISTY: See you, Bandy.
BAND Y: Bye.

925
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,300
SPARKS:
Thanks, Bandy.

926
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,100
MAPS: Bye.
- Hey, look.

927
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:49,300
MISTY: If it weren't for Maps, who knows
if any of us would have ever come back.

928
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,600
We could have gone on
thinking of the Cove...

929
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,200
...like one of those old postcards...

930
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:56,500
...realer than real...

931
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,900
...with each of us remembering it
however we chose.

932
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:16,100
Coming back for the first time
after all these years...

933
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:22,300
...fills me with a mixture of excitement
and the fear I made the whole thing up.

934
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:32,100
Believe it or not,
Maps did become a priest...

935
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:35,800
...traveling to Africa
to help with the refugees.

936
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:41,200
I got his letter just a few days
before his ashes arrived.

937
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:49,600
He told me how often
he thought about this place...

938
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:55,000
...and how happy he was
that we could share it together.

939
01:37:55,400 --> 01:38:00,400
Maps wrote me before he went
that if anything happened...

940
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,100
And here we are...

941
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,200
...the December boys.

942
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:50,300
ALL:
One, two, three, the December boys!

943
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:12,800
SPARKS:
Hey!

944
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:16,000
SPIT:
Maps! Hey!

945
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,000
Over here!

946
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,600
SPARKS:
Hey, Maps!

947
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:26,500
See you, fellas!

948
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
