1
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:29,196
I'll give you that third birthmark
right on your ass.

2
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,296
Let's go!

3
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,190
I'll take that hockey mask
and shove it right up your butt.

4
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:56,299
You see him?

5
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,399
No.

6
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,546
Come on, Jacob.
It's cool.

7
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:03,616
Ow!

8
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:06,112
Oh, you got him.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Come on, come on.

10
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:22,649
What the hell is that?
Piss.

11
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:26,431
Hurry up. Go!

12
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:30,335
Oh, shit!

13
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,567
It's piss!

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,156
You and your ugly-ass brother
are so dead.

15
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:40,395
Anytime you're
ready, dickhead.

16
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:41,611
Stop throwing up!

17
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,711
You're dead!

18
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,844
I'm past the deadline
on my thesis, Lee.

19
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,443
I don't have time to debate you.
She's your daughter.

20
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:28,551
Ma!
I need help.

21
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:29,707
You know what, Lee?

22
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:32,696
Any parent would be
parent of the year...

23
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:34,700
next to you, selfish prick.

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
Yeah, well...

25
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:49,004
You're late.

26
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:49,881
Yeah, well,

27
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:52,531
I began menstruating
this morning,

28
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:56,009
and I had some difficulty
inserting the tampon.

29
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,628
What? It's a natural process.

30
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:01,024
You know I could conceive...

31
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:02,988
and carry and birth
a child right now?

32
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:05,088
Big deal. You won't.

33
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:07,295
But I could.

34
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,899
Do you think I should
have Mom look at it?

35
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,606
Our birthday
comes once a year,

36
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,259
and you ask for
a hockey mask.

37
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,315
You don't even play.

38
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:21,140
Jason from Friday
the 13th wears one.

39
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
He's bad-ass.

40
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:27,140
I dropped piss
on Kenny's head.

41
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:28,395
What?

42
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:29,483
Jeff and Kenny were here.

43
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,412
I dropped the piss
I've been saving...

44
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:32,204
on their heads.

45
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,508
Why were you saving piss?

46
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:36,267
Just in case.
Pretty smart, huh?

47
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,483
No. It's stupid.

48
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,172
'Cause now they're
gonna come back here...

49
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:40,236
and kick all of our asses.

50
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:42,336
You're such a butt munch!

51
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:45,675
You guys!

52
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:46,956
It's your birthday!

53
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:49,056
Try to get along.

54
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,428
Malee. Take this up, please.

55
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:58,623
Cheese.

56
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:02,859
Okay, you got
your small gifts this morning.

57
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,959
Now for the big ones.

58
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,740
Oh, my God!

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,723
Yes! This is too cool.

60
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:14,638
Do you like it, Jacob?
Thanks.

61
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,899
It's ten acres.
- I'm not selling that land.

62
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,249
I'm willing to pay top dollar.

63
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,220
All right, you know
what I'm gonna do?

64
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,595
I'm gonna write
down a number.

65
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:49,158
Look, our kids play
in those woods...

66
00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:49,739
all the time.

67
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,339
You can't put a price on that.

68
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,439
I believe I can.

69
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:13,247
Go, man! Come on!

70
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:16,051
They're gonna...

71
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:17,003
tear down the tree
house tonight.

72
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:18,412
We gotta stop them.

73
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:20,584
So? It's just a tree house.

74
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,539
You suck.

75
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,564
Leonard, you in?

76
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:26,739
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.

77
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:29,055
I'll go.

78
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:39,456
Let him go.

79
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:07,851
Rudy?

80
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:12,226
Unless you're coming with me,
I don't wanna hear about it.

81
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,191
Jeff and Kenny pick
on you all the time,

82
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,364
and you don't do shit.

83
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:17,676
It's my problem.

84
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:20,363
No, it's my problem, too,
because we're brothers.

85
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,347
That's what brothers do.

86
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:24,447
I don't feel that way.

87
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:30,623
'Cause you're a pussy.

88
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,087
Rudy?

89
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,847
What?

90
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,767
Maybe we shouldn't talk.

91
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,231
Just listen for 'em.

92
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,643
And don't you fall asleep.

93
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:19,743
I'm wide awake.

94
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,767
Can you stop walking?

95
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:30,540
Wait up.
I've gotta get my lighter out.

96
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
All right, hurry up, man.

97
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,671
Come here.

98
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,475
We're gonna burn it down.
Here, come here.

99
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:39,755
Hell yeah, man.

100
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:41,855
Let's go.

101
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,843
Light mine, too.
- It's lit!

102
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:46,219
Move. You go first,
you go first.

103
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,319
All right.

104
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,999
Go.

105
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,083
You suck.
- Got it.

106
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:00,139
What?

107
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,291
You hear that?
Put it out!

108
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:02,827
Aw, shit, man!
They're in there!

109
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:04,747
Where are you going? !
- Go! Run!

110
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:06,847
Get back here!

111
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,377
Leonard! Aah!

112
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,643
Come on, wake up!

113
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:27,743
Come on!

114
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,637
Come on, you better get... Shit!

115
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,823
Oh, my God.

116
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,111
'Cause you're a pussy.

117
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:45,163
My baby!

118
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:47,263
Oh, my God!

119
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,459
Oh, my... my baby!

120
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:59,947
Jim, I, uh... I've gotta leave.

121
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,015
Again, I'm just...

122
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:04,543
I'm so, so sorry.

123
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:14,066
You still interested
in buying that land?

124
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:16,011
We can talk about it
later if you'd like.

125
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:17,727
Build houses,
condos, 7-Eleven,

126
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:18,475
I don't care.

127
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:21,725
I just don't wanna recognize it
ever again.

128
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:26,046
Okay.

129
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:32,494
This hospital is a nightmare.

130
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:39,403
How are you feeling?
- My head hurts.

131
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:42,859
You're lucky you
didn't get killed.

132
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,331
I told you I'm sorry.

133
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:47,131
I've never been
so scared in my life.

134
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,806
And... poor Rudy.

135
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:31,807
Was it a friend or family?

136
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:34,175
Huh?

137
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:36,223
The person who died.

138
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:39,551
Friend.

139
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:43,454
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,034
Well, you're...
you're gonna like Dr. Chung.

141
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:51,459
This is only my
second session.

142
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:53,419
She's really good.

143
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,144
I'm not a patient.
I'm her daughter.

144
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,631
Oh, yeah!

145
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:00,075
I can see the resemblance.

146
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:02,280
You trying to make me sick?

147
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:08,506
Miss Farland,
you can come in now.

148
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,831
Mr. Maitland?

149
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:18,232
I... I'll be just a second.

150
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,287
You're upset...

151
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,719
...and that's good.

152
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,459
And it's okay to
cry, you know?

153
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,483
Ma.

154
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,627
I know it's okay to cry, okay?

155
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:42,442
I don't need you to tell me
it's okay to cry.

156
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,542
If I wanna cry, I'll cry.

157
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:48,894
Fine.

158
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:01,739
You've gotta eat something.

159
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,691
Leonard has a condition.

160
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,791
It's called anosmia.

161
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:08,294
Oh, my God.
Is it serious?

162
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:11,723
No. Anosmia is when a person
loses their sense of smell.

163
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,387
It's not uncommon in patients...

164
00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:15,051
who suffer severe
head injuries.

165
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:17,221
Unfortunately, it's
also affecting...

166
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:18,474
his ability to taste.

167
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:20,574
Again, not uncommon.

168
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,715
I-is it permanent?

169
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,109
That depends upon
the patient.

170
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,872
What... what do we do?

171
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:30,283
He can't eat.

172
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:31,458
Oh, he can eat.

173
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:34,333
He just can't taste
what he's eating.

174
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:36,875
I... I can't believe
this is happening.

175
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:38,446
Considering what Leonard...

176
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,298
could have suffered,
he's lucky.

177
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:42,820
And he is severely overweight.

178
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:46,643
Perhaps a loss of appetite
will be a benefit.

179
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:51,338
It feels gross, this
film on my tongue.

180
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:53,695
Hey.

181
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,563
I don't like apples.

182
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:01,514
So, you can't taste it, right?

183
00:14:01,614 --> 00:14:03,789
Maybe you'll like the crunch.

184
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:01,675
Oh, my God.

185
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,435
That guy...

186
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,535
I... I. , like, know him.

187
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,859
He... he's one of
my mom's patients.

188
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,527
So?

189
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:19,150
Should we go over and say hi?

190
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:21,646
I just wanna get out of here.

191
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,191
You coming, Malee?

192
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,039
Tommy Camacho.

193
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,950
Jacob Carges.

194
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,079
Rudy Carges.

195
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,719
Rudy Carges.

196
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:55,998
He's not in class anymore.

197
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,399
Now, how do you know?

198
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,850
'Cause he's dead.

199
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,155
It is not funny
to joke like that...

200
00:16:02,255 --> 00:16:05,462
about a fellow
classmate's death,

201
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:07,562
Mr. Carges.

202
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,897
Are you...
- His brother.

203
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:12,267
Was.

204
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,116
And I'm not kidding.
He's dead.

205
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,775
I'm so sorry.

206
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:23,711
Eight.

207
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:26,462
Ooh!

208
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:29,750
The state's requirement...

209
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,659
for upper body strength
is ten chin-ups.

210
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,759
Leonard, you're up.

211
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,910
Come on, son.

212
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,302
Come on, son!
Fight it.

213
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,910
Hey. That's enough.

214
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:01,503
All right, good job.

215
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:04,446
Who hasn't gone?

216
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:19,760
Did anyone practice
over the summer?

217
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:26,820
Great. Well, we still have
a fall recital coming up.

218
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,819
If anyone would like
to perform a solo,

219
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,539
the sign-up sheet
is on the door.

220
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:32,639
Class dismissed.

221
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,519
Not you, Leonard.

222
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:04,171
Center. That's the position
you'll be playing in two years.

223
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:05,514
Football?

224
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:08,171
You don't like football?
- I love it.

225
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:08,853
It's just...

226
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:10,955
I'll never make the
weight requirement.

227
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,560
Oh, there's no weight
requirement...

228
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
in high school, son.

229
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:19,071
These are your new bibles.

230
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:22,858
One on nutrition,
the other exercise.

231
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:24,651
Now, you do what they say,

232
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:28,235
and you can play for me
once you come to high school.

233
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:30,335
Thanks.

234
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,205
Coach, why are you
doing this for me?

235
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:45,121
Because I've never met a child
so out of shape in my life.

236
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,226
I'm being stupid?

237
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:54,890
No, they are wrong.
You call them back.

238
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,131
Ashley, I talked to the lawyer.
He wouldn't lie.

239
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:58,251
What's going on?

240
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,338
You know what?
This is all your fault.

241
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,363
Me?
- Yes.

242
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:01,046
Because if you'd
done what I said...

243
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:01,483
and gone to the trial,

244
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,506
this never would
have happened!

245
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:04,472
We both agreed it
would be too painful!

246
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:05,259
We both agreed!

247
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,050
You agreed!

248
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,289
Mom, what happened?
Tell him.

249
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,366
Tell your son.

250
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:20,458
The boys who killed Rudy
cut a deal.

251
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,363
They got a year in juvenile hall
and five years' probation.

252
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,397
One year.
That's what his life is wroth.

253
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,619
Ashley.
- One year.

254
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:29,222
Just calm down.

255
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,635
How can you be so
unaffected by this?

256
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:32,555
Your son was murdered!

257
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,891
It was an accident.

258
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:37,831
It was an accident.

259
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:39,818
And those boys
were juveniles.

260
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:41,918
So that makes it okay?

261
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:18,942
You're dead!

262
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,498
You don't believe me.
No, they're wrong!

263
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,843
It was an accident.

264
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:25,143
One.

265
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:27,690
That's what his life
is worth. One year.

266
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,565
Ashley, just...
Your son was murdered!

267
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,917
I can't believe
how much you suck.

268
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,270
I want them dead.

269
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:51,252
I wanna kill them.
I could handle a year in prison.

270
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,371
Don't you miss him?

271
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,471
You don't even care!

272
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:59,690
It's not that we don't care.

273
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,810
It's just...

274
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,795
Life goes on.

275
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,619
It does.

276
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:05,931
You have to deal with it.

277
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,203
You know 90% of people's
problems are...

278
00:21:08,303 --> 00:21:10,698
due to their inability
to get over the past?

279
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:12,798
How do you know?

280
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:14,890
Mom tells that to
all her patients.

281
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,751
I've eavesdropped...

282
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:17,099
on some of her
therapy sessions.

283
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,981
That's cool.
Can I listen in sometime?

284
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,046
No.

285
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:26,028
Anyway, she says
if a person wants closure,

286
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:29,194
they gotta deal
with their problems head-on.

287
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:31,114
Go see these guys
and tell them how you feel.

288
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:34,364
Juvy hall's only
like 40 minutes from here.

289
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,542
Take a taxi.

290
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,138
I hate you!
You know that? !

291
00:22:48,238 --> 00:22:50,238
Hmm?

292
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:53,253
All this happened
'cause of you.

293
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:55,326
You deformed retard!

294
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,245
Every night I lie in bed
and plan your murder.

295
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:03,294
I'm shaking.

296
00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:09,994
I'm gonna take a kitchen knife
and chop off your fingers.

297
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:12,794
Then your nose,
and then your tongue.

298
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:17,034
Then I'm gonna take scissors
and cut off your ears.

299
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,675
When they find you, it'll be like...

300
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:22,625
putting a jigsaw
puzzle back together.

301
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,921
You kill me, you come here.

302
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,323
So? What do I have
to look forward to?

303
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:31,789
You destroyed my life!

304
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:34,104
What happened
was an accident!

305
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,670
There are no accidents.

306
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,562
You're gonna pay
for what you did.

307
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:41,912
And it's gonna hurt like hell.

308
00:23:56,622 --> 00:23:58,622
Don't I know you?

309
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,570
You're Dr. Chung's daughter.

310
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,030
Yeah. You remember. Um...

311
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,114
We were never introduced.
My name's Malee.

312
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:08,298
Oh, hey.

313
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:10,058
Hi.

314
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,158
Gus. Hi.

315
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:15,486
What are you doing here?

316
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:19,228
I... I was in the mood
for a picnic, um...

317
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:22,698
And I thought this would be
a nice place to have one.

318
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:24,074
Move that fucking truck!

319
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:26,174
Right.
- Um...

320
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:30,422
Would you like to join me?
'Cause there's plenty of food.

321
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:33,778
Uh, you know what, I
don't go for lunch...

322
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:35,306
for another ten minutes, so...

323
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:37,406
I'll wait.

324
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,360
Meet me by that cement mixer
when... when you're ready.

325
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,044
So last time I saw you,

326
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:50,986
you were just getting
back from a funeral.

327
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:53,086
How are you doing?

328
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:55,902
Okay.

329
00:24:57,838 --> 00:25:00,463
Death is, like, so
weird, you know?

330
00:25:02,286 --> 00:25:04,286
I mean, it's sad...

331
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:08,362
...but I also feel
like I've been given this sign.

332
00:25:08,462 --> 00:25:10,832
A sign which is telling
me life is short,

333
00:25:10,932 --> 00:25:13,066
so you gotta do what
makes you happy.

334
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,751
You gotta take chances and...

335
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,822
get crazy!

336
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:20,698
And what are you
doing to get crazy?

337
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,358
I... I play the flute.

338
00:25:26,446 --> 00:25:28,874
Well, you know,
that's... that's totally nuts.

339
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:31,112
The flute.

340
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:32,266
No, not like that.

341
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:36,716
Just, you know, like every year
my school has this recital.

342
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,146
Um, and, you
know, every year,

343
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:43,311
I've been, like, too
chicken to play a solo...

344
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:45,034
in front of people.

345
00:25:45,134 --> 00:25:49,095
Um, but I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it this year.

346
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:53,319
You know what, good for you.

347
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,190
That's great.
Good for you.

348
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,910
When is it?

349
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,674
Why do you care?

350
00:26:01,774 --> 00:26:02,890
Oh, 'cause I'm gonna come.

351
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,458
What?

352
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:06,250
Yeah.
- You can't go!

353
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,402
Sure I can.

354
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:09,602
Nobody goes to these things.

355
00:26:10,158 --> 00:26:11,530
I don't even think
my mom's coming.

356
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,200
Well, you're gonna
need somebody...

357
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,314
to root for you, right?

358
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:15,850
And besides, I love music.

359
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,068
And, you know, I owe you
for this terrific lunch, right?

360
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:26,890
Are we having company?

361
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,194
It is all for you.

362
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:31,082
Your favorites.

363
00:26:31,182 --> 00:26:35,373
Oh, and I made everything
extra spicy...

364
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:37,543
so you can taste it.

365
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:40,914
Mom, it doesn't matter
how spicy the food is.

366
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:43,338
So you're not
gonna even try it?

367
00:26:43,438 --> 00:26:45,438
I'm sure it's delicious.

368
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,022
Forget it.

369
00:26:49,646 --> 00:26:51,646
Don't eat.

370
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:55,418
You can't just eat
apples all the time.

371
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,430
Why not?

372
00:26:59,438 --> 00:27:01,438
It's unhealthy.

373
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:53,607
But why now, though?
I mean, I...

374
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:55,370
I haven't fought fires
in over three years.

375
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,194
Something stirred
your unconscious.

376
00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:59,869
If we can figure
out what that was,

377
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,969
we can get some answers.

378
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,433
Okay.

379
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,533
All right!

380
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,074
Let's do it!

381
00:28:08,174 --> 00:28:10,446
You said that your
nightmares started...

382
00:28:10,546 --> 00:28:12,586
around the time that
you moved here.

383
00:28:12,686 --> 00:28:13,610
Yeah.

384
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,953
Let's explore that.

385
00:28:15,053 --> 00:28:16,586
Why did you move here?

386
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:19,761
A friend of mine was
working construction.

387
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,419
He got a job offer...

388
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,427
over at the... the
Lindsay Acres job,

389
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,698
and, uh, I thought
it'd be a good idea...

390
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,001
to come work with him
for a little while.

391
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:32,450
Are there any
recurring elements...

392
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,930
to your dreams?

393
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,030
Faces?

394
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:42,188
Burnin' for You keeps playing.

395
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,850
Burnin' for you?

396
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,025
Yeah, you know,
the Blue Oyster Cult song?

397
00:28:58,414 --> 00:29:00,585
Dad?
- Jacob.

398
00:29:00,654 --> 00:29:02,654
Y-you okay?

399
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:05,278
Fantastic.

400
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:08,094
You know...

401
00:29:09,134 --> 00:29:12,516
For the past few weeks,
I sat in this house...

402
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:15,774
I couldn't move.

403
00:29:15,918 --> 00:29:18,438
Everything reminded
me of Rudy.

404
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,635
And then from
out of nowhere...

405
00:29:22,157 --> 00:29:24,157
...I had a revelation.

406
00:29:24,878 --> 00:29:26,153
I'm alive.

407
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:28,138
Your mother is alive.

408
00:29:28,238 --> 00:29:30,238
And I became overcome...

409
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:34,498
...with joy, because I realized...

410
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:37,223
how lucky we are
to still have you.

411
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,278
Me?

412
00:29:41,902 --> 00:29:43,902
Jacob.

413
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:50,142
I love you.

414
00:29:56,302 --> 00:29:59,241
I went to work today
for the first time in weeks.

415
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,457
I was fearless.

416
00:30:00,557 --> 00:30:02,825
It was as if I'd just
gotten out of college.

417
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:05,290
I went after accounts
I'd avoided for years...

418
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,330
because I thought
they were out of my league.

419
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,930
And I was amazing.

420
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,070
I was magic!

421
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:12,872
But then when I came home...

422
00:30:12,972 --> 00:30:13,897
to share the news
with your mother,

423
00:30:13,997 --> 00:30:14,687
I found her asleep,

424
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:16,138
and then when I
looked at the house,

425
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:19,049
I realized that her office,
for lack of a better word,

426
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:21,898
was also piled up,
so I took to the house.

427
00:30:21,998 --> 00:30:24,308
I have made it my duty
to clean this place...

428
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:25,354
from top to bottom,

429
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:28,379
even if it takes me
all freakin' night.

430
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:30,782
Jacob.

431
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,484
Yeah?
- Will you join me?

432
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,517
Join me in this
symbolic gesture...

433
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:37,066
of cleaning out the old...

434
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,166
and bringing in the new.

435
00:30:40,686 --> 00:30:42,686
Do I have to?

436
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,125
No.

437
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,942
Thank you.

438
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,582
A wonderfully
rousing rendition.

439
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:28,994
Our next soloist
is Malee Chung.

440
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,998
She will play the theme
from Love Story...

441
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,098
on the flute.

442
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:39,998
Thank you, Mr. Farmer.

443
00:31:40,653 --> 00:31:43,555
Um, there's actually
been a change.

444
00:31:44,878 --> 00:31:48,178
I'm not gonna play the theme
from Love Story.

445
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:49,897
Um, this is a s... s...

446
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:51,997
What?

447
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:54,173
I can't hear you!

448
00:31:55,501 --> 00:32:00,138
Anyway, um, this is a song
from the Blue Oyster Cult.

449
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,798
One, two, three, four.

450
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:14,238
Can I see that?

451
00:33:14,318 --> 00:33:16,618
Malee, you are always
surprising me.

452
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:17,929
That was great.

453
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,029
Malee.

454
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:23,971
Wow! Wow, wow, wow.

455
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:27,362
You... you were awesome.

456
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,970
Really?
- Yeah.

457
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,234
Be honest, because I'd rather
you told me I suck than lie.

458
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:34,345
No, no. You were...
you were great.

459
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,490
Hi, I'm Leonard Fisher.
It's nice to meet you.

460
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,769
Hey. Gus.
- Gus.

461
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:39,114
Excuse me.

462
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:40,969
Okay, okay, I'm leaving.
Nice to meet you.

463
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:43,069
We'll see you later.

464
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:47,588
Y-you really enjoyed it?
- Yeah, yeah.

465
00:33:48,814 --> 00:33:51,235
It's a good song.
- Yeah.

466
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:53,309
What made you choose that?

467
00:33:55,438 --> 00:33:57,434
My mother. She
was humming it...

468
00:33:57,534 --> 00:33:59,018
all last week, you know,

469
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:01,932
'cause she's a big B.O.C. fan.

470
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:04,426
Right.
- Yeah.

471
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:07,526
Was she here?
- No. No, she's got class.

472
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,230
Hmm.
- Yeah.

473
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,623
Well, she missed out.

474
00:34:16,525 --> 00:34:18,525
You're so sweet.

475
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:21,065
Malee, I, uh...
I had a really good time.

476
00:34:21,165 --> 00:34:23,915
I... I gotta run, but, uh...
- Okay.

477
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:26,764
But thank you.
Really, thanks.

478
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,533
Bye, hon.

479
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:14,697
Leonard threw our candy
down the gutter.

480
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:15,689
What? !
- What?

481
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:17,353
You suck!
- Shut up.

482
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:18,537
Hey. Hayley.

483
00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:20,970
Hey. Why'd you
throw their candy away?

484
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,070
It's crap.

485
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:28,704
I'm gonna ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.

486
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:30,409
Are you in a cult?

487
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:31,498
Grace.

488
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:33,833
This is exactly what happens
when kids join cults.

489
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:36,265
The first thing they change
is their diets.

490
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:38,365
I'm not in a cult.

491
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:41,417
The issue is that
you have stolen...

492
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:43,696
one of the most exciting
nights of the year...

493
00:35:43,796 --> 00:35:44,618
from your sisters.

494
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:45,330
If anybody had done
this to you...

495
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:45,769
when you were a kid,

496
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:46,858
we never would've
heard the end of it.

497
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,058
Exactly.
- Now, get upstairs.

498
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:52,618
Now!

499
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:55,268
I wish somebody
had done it to me.

500
00:35:55,598 --> 00:35:58,523
Maybe then I wouldn't be
such a fat pig.

501
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:34,237
What'd you say to him?

502
00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:38,622
Just stop.

503
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:42,057
Why are you doing this?

504
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:43,498
To remind you.

505
00:36:43,598 --> 00:36:45,033
How could we forget?

506
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:47,472
You've been coming
here for months...

507
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,361
to remind us.

508
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:51,086
No one's forcing
you to talk to me.

509
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:55,433
Anything to get out of my cell.

510
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:57,533
Is your cell small?

511
00:36:57,773 --> 00:36:58,698
Yes.

512
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:00,798
So is a coffin.

513
00:37:01,293 --> 00:37:03,498
Look, I'd do anything
to bring him back,

514
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:05,598
but I can't.

515
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:08,097
It's not easy being in here.

516
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:09,929
You saw Jeff.

517
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:12,029
Oh, what happened to him?

518
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:15,753
Pissed the wrong guy off.

519
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:18,788
Jeff's totally fucked right now.
- Good.

520
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,809
Look, don't come back
here ever again.

521
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:22,505
Free country.
I'll come if I want.

522
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:24,630
Don't expect me to show up!

523
00:37:27,053 --> 00:37:29,420
Get off me, man!

524
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,377
I am not taking your
Halloween candy.

525
00:37:38,477 --> 00:37:40,477
Come on.

526
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,185
If I wanna keep this
firm ass as an adult,

527
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:46,729
I gotta develop good
eating habits now.

528
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:49,604
And this is not good.
Not good for me.

529
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:54,762
All right, maybe just,
uh, the spider ring.

530
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,830
Okay.

531
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:00,714
All right.

532
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:03,677
So, work is good.

533
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:09,368
You know what, to
be honest with you,

534
00:38:09,468 --> 00:38:12,010
I can't wait till
this job is finished.

535
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,360
Kind of creepy here, you know.

536
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:16,681
You know that a...
a boy died here?

537
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:19,256
Right before we
started this job?

538
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:21,981
Rudy. His name was Rudy.

539
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:23,401
Oh, you knew him?

540
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,145
Yeah. Um, he's one
of my best friends.

541
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:29,033
You remember that
funeral I went to?

542
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,206
Yeah. That was him, huh?

543
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:34,352
Some kids
threw a flaming cocktail at him.

544
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:38,281
Can you imagine
killing someone like that?

545
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:40,556
I mean, how evil can you get?

546
00:38:44,877 --> 00:38:46,877
Gus?

547
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,661
Yes.

548
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:52,285
You okay?

549
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:55,389
Yeah.

550
00:39:01,197 --> 00:39:03,197
Jeff Laskey is dead.

551
00:39:04,685 --> 00:39:06,685
What?

552
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:10,845
He committed suicide
in his jail cell last night.

553
00:39:11,373 --> 00:39:13,923
Carol Evey just
called to tell me.

554
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,285
Justice is served.

555
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:22,493
End of story.

556
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,045
What the hell do you want?

557
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,345
I'm sorry about Jeff.

558
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:48,445
Like you give a shit!

559
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:53,648
I bet when you heard,
you started dancing.

560
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,445
Hmm.

561
00:42:57,581 --> 00:42:59,581
Ha!

562
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:02,109
Uhh!

563
00:44:31,597 --> 00:44:35,272
I was watching that.
- Well, finish your homework.

564
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:37,991
So because you're an atheist,

565
00:44:38,091 --> 00:44:39,817
I don't get to
celebrate the holidays?

566
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:42,248
Just because I don't
turn our home...

567
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:44,873
into a Jesus-themed
disco once a year...

568
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,377
does not mean I'm an atheist.

569
00:44:46,477 --> 00:44:50,227
All I'm asking for is a tree, Ma.
Maybe a stocking.

570
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:54,065
How does nailing a
sock to the wall...

571
00:44:54,165 --> 00:44:56,165
reconnect you with God?

572
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:59,947
I don't know.
- Hmm?

573
00:45:01,197 --> 00:45:03,197
Forget it, Ma, okay?

574
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:07,842
An iPod? Sweet!

575
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:09,257
Do you like it?

576
00:45:09,357 --> 00:45:11,357
I love it.

577
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:14,711
You guys went crazy this year.

578
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:32,188
May I be excused?

579
00:45:33,229 --> 00:45:35,229
No.

580
00:45:52,045 --> 00:45:53,805
I'm gonna take a shower.

581
00:45:53,905 --> 00:45:56,080
No, we have one more present.

582
00:45:56,141 --> 00:45:57,353
I thought we were gonna wait.

583
00:45:57,453 --> 00:45:59,928
No, do it now!
Come on, do it now!

584
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,329
Your father and I
have seriously discussed...

585
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:14,316
...adopting for many
years now, so...

586
00:46:14,381 --> 00:46:16,520
we decided to adopt a baby.

587
00:46:19,213 --> 00:46:21,213
Hopefully a boy.

588
00:46:31,757 --> 00:46:35,081
Don't worry. White male infants
are the hardest to come by.

589
00:46:35,181 --> 00:46:37,097
60 Minutes did a
whole story on it.

590
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:39,081
Any adoption agency
worth its salt...

591
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:41,001
has at least a
three-year waiting list.

592
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:42,569
By the time your
parents get a kid,

593
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:43,529
you'll be in college.

594
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:45,374
You think they'll
want to start over...

595
00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:46,345
with that baby shit?

596
00:46:46,445 --> 00:46:50,720
No. It's just... It's like
they're trying to replace Rudy.

597
00:46:51,149 --> 00:46:54,824
Doesn't matter, man,
'cause it's not gonna happen.

598
00:46:54,957 --> 00:46:56,425
I'm thirsty.

599
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,550
Can you get us some drinks?

600
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:00,424
Why me?

601
00:47:00,524 --> 00:47:02,152
'Cause it's the
gentlemanly thing to do.

602
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,009
I'll get drinks.
- I'll go with you.

603
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:05,240
Why are you guys...

604
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,529
all of a sudden
going to get drinks?

605
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:09,379
Because you've upset me,

606
00:47:09,479 --> 00:47:12,479
and I don't wanna talk
to you right now.

607
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,532
Fine. I'll get the drinks.

608
00:47:25,036 --> 00:47:27,464
I need you to hide
something for me.

609
00:47:27,564 --> 00:47:29,564
What?

610
00:47:30,957 --> 00:47:33,507
Promise you won't freak?
- I won't.

611
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,569
Holy shit!

612
00:47:38,669 --> 00:47:39,977
You said you wouldn't freak!

613
00:47:40,077 --> 00:47:42,077
That's a gun!

614
00:47:43,788 --> 00:47:45,788
Wh-where did you get it?

615
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:48,381
I can't tell you.

616
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:51,578
I just need you to
hide it for a while.

617
00:47:55,693 --> 00:47:57,693
Why can't you keep it?

618
00:47:57,901 --> 00:47:59,400
My mother's a total snoop.

619
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,481
She goes through my stuff,
like, all the time.

620
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:03,273
Please, Jacob.

621
00:48:03,373 --> 00:48:05,998
Somebody's life
might depend on it.

622
00:48:49,037 --> 00:48:51,037
Here's the deal.

623
00:48:51,757 --> 00:48:54,249
You know how my company
flies me to Florida every year?

624
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:58,399
Yeah. You and I go every year.
It's the guys' week off.

625
00:48:58,445 --> 00:49:00,770
This year I'm taking the girls.

626
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:02,312
Just the girls.

627
00:49:02,412 --> 00:49:04,412
You're staying home.

628
00:49:05,996 --> 00:49:07,996
Why can't we all go?

629
00:49:08,108 --> 00:49:10,121
I'm not staying here all alone.

630
00:49:10,221 --> 00:49:13,480
Besides, like you said,
you've been going for years.

631
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,605
Give your sisters a chance.

632
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,325
Whatever.

633
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,820
I need money.

634
00:49:26,189 --> 00:49:27,112
What for?

635
00:49:27,212 --> 00:49:28,969
New clothes.

636
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:31,720
Nothing I have fits anymore.
- Your father and I aren't rich.

637
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,761
You can't get a new wardrobe
anytime you want.

638
00:49:34,861 --> 00:49:36,872
What am I supposed to do?
Go to school naked?

639
00:49:36,972 --> 00:49:38,972
Wear a belt.

640
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:41,737
I'll... give him some cash.
You can get some clothes.

641
00:49:41,837 --> 00:49:43,837
No!

642
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,020
Grace.
- What? !

643
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,475
The X-men one's pretty sweet.

644
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:05,973
The last batch was awesome.

645
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:12,392
I gotta go.

646
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:14,492
Wait. Wait.

647
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:20,649
Parole board feels
I've been a model prisoner.

648
00:50:20,749 --> 00:50:23,374
They're giving me
an early release.

649
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:29,672
How can they do that?
- I don't know.

650
00:50:29,772 --> 00:50:31,772
They just did.

651
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:36,349
You're pissed, aren't you?

652
00:50:37,356 --> 00:50:39,356
I knew you'd be.

653
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:44,761
What happened
was an accident, Jacob.

654
00:50:47,308 --> 00:50:49,308
So, you're gettin' out.

655
00:50:51,884 --> 00:50:53,289
Gonna head back to school?

656
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:54,632
Fuck school.

657
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:56,732
I'm going to New Mexico.

658
00:50:57,069 --> 00:50:59,069
Live with my dad.

659
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:01,161
Works on a ranch out there.

660
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:04,488
You can't leave the state.
It violates your probation.

661
00:51:04,588 --> 00:51:06,588
My dad won't tell anybody.

662
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:10,217
No one will even
notice I'm out there.

663
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,317
Your mom will.

664
00:51:14,732 --> 00:51:17,512
Jacob, the entire time
I've been in here,

665
00:51:17,612 --> 00:51:19,817
you're the only one
that came to see me.

666
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:21,917
She won't care.

667
00:52:02,957 --> 00:52:04,489
Malee!

668
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:07,109
Wow. My God!

669
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,050
You look, uh...
- Different?

670
00:52:11,724 --> 00:52:12,648
Beautiful.

671
00:52:12,748 --> 00:52:14,748
You look beautiful.

672
00:52:18,477 --> 00:52:19,987
Well, I bet you are...

673
00:52:20,087 --> 00:52:22,562
driving the boys
at school crazy.

674
00:52:23,756 --> 00:52:26,531
Boys my age are so immature,
you know?

675
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,350
I'm more attracted
to older gentlemen.

676
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:33,919
Well, you know, you
don't wanna date...

677
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:34,857
somebody older than you,

678
00:52:34,957 --> 00:52:36,296
do you?

679
00:52:36,396 --> 00:52:39,145
I mean, an age difference,
that can cause problems.

680
00:52:39,245 --> 00:52:41,245
What kind of problems?

681
00:52:42,508 --> 00:52:44,232
Well, I don't...
you know, problems.

682
00:52:44,332 --> 00:52:46,611
You know, I think
when a couple...

683
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:48,168
has an age difference,

684
00:52:48,268 --> 00:52:50,054
they, um... they end
up splitting up...

685
00:52:50,154 --> 00:52:51,752
because they want
different things.

686
00:52:51,852 --> 00:52:53,852
You mean sex?

687
00:52:54,124 --> 00:52:56,645
Uh, no. No.

688
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:58,716
No.

689
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,525
Well, yeah, yeah.

690
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:04,361
Let's say, you know,
you're 12, right?

691
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:07,527
And a boy
just a few years older than ya,

692
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:09,480
well, you know,
he'll be more experienced,

693
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,983
and boys... they
can be impatient...

694
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,736
about that sort of thing.

695
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:16,291
Are you impatient?
- No.

696
00:53:16,812 --> 00:53:18,536
But I was when I was a kid.

697
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:20,040
Yeah.

698
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,540
Why don't you have
a girlfriend?

699
00:53:23,628 --> 00:53:26,253
Well, I did, but that didn't, uh...

700
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,028
That didn't work out so well.

701
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
How old was she?

702
00:53:33,932 --> 00:53:35,720
About my age.

703
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,596
See that?

704
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:39,399
Age wasn't an
issue, you know?

705
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:41,864
You still wanted
different things.

706
00:53:41,964 --> 00:53:44,139
I don't think it's about age.

707
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:48,076
I think when two
people really connect,

708
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,465
they connect for
other reasons.

709
00:53:50,989 --> 00:53:53,614
And since soul
mates are eternal...

710
00:53:53,836 --> 00:53:55,836
...they have no age.

711
00:54:05,293 --> 00:54:07,318
Take care of your mom, huh?

712
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Have fun.

713
00:54:15,341 --> 00:54:17,341
Bye.

714
00:55:06,252 --> 00:55:07,432
We're home.

715
00:55:07,532 --> 00:55:09,532
Hi.
- Hi.

716
00:55:10,028 --> 00:55:12,875
He's here.
Why don't you come out?

717
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,184
Jacob. This is Keith Gardner,

718
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,252
your new brother.

719
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:26,595
Keith, our son Jacob.

720
00:55:26,668 --> 00:55:28,773
It's nice to meet you.

721
00:55:35,596 --> 00:55:37,064
Help!

722
00:55:37,164 --> 00:55:38,313
Leonard?

723
00:55:38,413 --> 00:55:40,328
...pour it in slowly.
or all of this crust...

724
00:55:40,428 --> 00:55:41,672
Leonard!

725
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:45,700
...wash away.
Just put it in nice and easy.

726
00:55:45,772 --> 00:55:47,561
See, it's kind of thick already.

727
00:55:47,661 --> 00:55:49,129
What's wrong?

728
00:55:49,229 --> 00:55:51,464
It's on top of me!
I can't get up!

729
00:55:51,564 --> 00:55:53,480
Mom, there's so much blood!

730
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,646
Leonard?
I'm bleeding!

731
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,176
Oh, Jesus!

732
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:01,546
Leonard? Leonard?

733
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,912
Leonard?
Leonard, where...

734
00:56:03,981 --> 00:56:06,681
Leonard, where...
What are you doing?

735
00:56:06,892 --> 00:56:09,674
What... Are you okay?

736
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,913
Leonard, what...
Don't shut the door.

737
00:56:12,013 --> 00:56:14,151
Open the door.

738
00:56:14,988 --> 00:56:17,673
Leonard...
Leonard, what are you doing?

739
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:21,068
Leonard? Leonard,
open the door.

740
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:23,132
You get top bunk.

741
00:56:29,868 --> 00:56:34,368
No offense, but I never thought
my future brother would be...

742
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,020
...a brotha.

743
00:56:37,933 --> 00:56:39,336
I never thought my
future brother...

744
00:56:39,436 --> 00:56:41,704
would have a Kool-Aid stain
smeared across his face.

745
00:56:41,804 --> 00:56:43,804
Fuck you!
It's a birthmark.

746
00:56:52,972 --> 00:56:56,122
Leonard, what are you doing?
Open the door.

747
00:57:09,068 --> 00:57:11,068
That's what this is about?

748
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:12,232
Food?

749
00:57:12,332 --> 00:57:13,992
I'm trying to save
your life, Mom.

750
00:57:14,092 --> 00:57:15,752
I don't need you
to save my life.

751
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:18,721
I need you to open
the fucking door!

752
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,322
I'm doing this
because I love you.

753
00:57:36,972 --> 00:57:40,722
Because she's getting older
and she needs a father.

754
00:57:40,812 --> 00:57:42,024
Call collect.

755
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:44,648
Ma, is that Dad?
Let me talk to him, okay?

756
00:57:44,748 --> 00:57:47,748
That's not good enough.
You can't just...

757
00:57:53,324 --> 00:57:55,324
He hung up.

758
00:57:55,852 --> 00:57:57,852
What do you expect, Ma?

759
00:57:58,444 --> 00:57:59,720
All you ever do is yell at him.

760
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,257
Oh, Malee.

761
00:58:01,357 --> 00:58:03,560
You don't know
what you're talking about.

762
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,660
If you keep this up...

763
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,720
...I'll leave this place...

764
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,820
and go live with him.

765
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:14,460
Really? I would love to
hear his reaction...

766
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,880
to that proposal.

767
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,980
You're a bitch.

768
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,788
What did you just say?

769
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,936
Come here.
No, no!

770
00:58:25,036 --> 00:58:26,120
Come here, sit down.
- Let go of me!

771
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,264
You wanna call him?
You wanna go live with him?

772
00:58:28,364 --> 00:58:29,896
Look at me when
I'm talking to you!

773
00:58:29,996 --> 00:58:31,624
Here! I'll dial the phone!
Okay?

774
00:58:31,724 --> 00:58:33,158
What is wrong with you?

775
00:58:33,258 --> 00:58:35,208
There is nothing
wrong with me!

776
00:58:35,308 --> 00:58:37,414
You wanna go live with him?

777
00:58:37,484 --> 00:58:39,158
Don't you realize that
if your father...

778
00:58:39,258 --> 00:58:40,200
wanted you in his life,

779
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,126
the phone wouldn't be...

780
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,344
the only means of
communication?

781
00:58:42,444 --> 00:58:44,919
I mean, wake up, Malee!
He's gone!

782
00:58:48,652 --> 00:58:50,184
I gotta get out of there, man.

783
00:58:50,284 --> 00:58:53,284
I can't live in that
house one more day.

784
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,845
I wanna come with you
to New Mexico.

785
00:58:58,316 --> 00:58:59,560
No way.

786
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,832
You've never even
been out on of the road.

787
00:59:01,932 --> 00:59:03,336
So?

788
00:59:03,436 --> 00:59:06,361
You don't need me
to run away from home.

789
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,265
And you wanna go with me,
of all people.

790
00:59:12,588 --> 00:59:14,588
That was an accident.

791
00:59:23,788 --> 00:59:24,814
I can be helpful.

792
00:59:24,914 --> 00:59:27,080
I can get everything
we need ready.

793
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,955
As soon as you're
released, we'll go.

794
00:59:31,116 --> 00:59:33,116
Please, Kenny.

795
00:59:38,796 --> 00:59:40,821
If this is what you want...

796
00:59:41,516 --> 00:59:43,516
...all right.

797
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,340
Help!

798
01:00:43,499 --> 01:00:45,499
Leonard!

799
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:49,282
Leonard!
Open the door now!

800
01:00:49,356 --> 01:00:51,048
Unh!

801
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:53,148
Leonard!

802
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:56,516
Let me out of
here, God damn it!

803
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:00,188
Leo...

804
01:01:07,692 --> 01:01:09,512
Leonard!

805
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:11,368
Damn it, let me out!

806
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:13,468
Leonard!

807
01:04:09,899 --> 01:04:11,623
Oh, my God.

808
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:13,723
I smell gas.

809
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,652
Leonard.

810
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:20,167
Leonard!

811
01:04:20,267 --> 01:04:22,471
Don't you smell the gas? !

812
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:27,228
Leonard!

813
01:04:27,628 --> 01:04:29,628
Leonard! The gas!

814
01:04:31,275 --> 01:04:33,348
The gas is on, Leonard!

815
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:34,952
Leonard, the gas...

816
01:04:35,052 --> 01:04:37,052
Okay, okay.

817
01:04:37,772 --> 01:04:39,772
Leonard!

818
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:46,971
Aah!

819
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:53,148
Leonard.

820
01:04:59,916 --> 01:05:02,305
Leonard.
Leonard, wake up.

821
01:05:06,988 --> 01:05:08,988
Leonard.

822
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:20,315
No!

823
01:05:20,812 --> 01:05:22,632
Please!

824
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:24,168
Aah!

825
01:05:24,268 --> 01:05:26,268
Please!

826
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:37,308
What the hell is this?

827
01:05:40,332 --> 01:05:42,332
I made dinner, my love.

828
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:44,936
Right.

829
01:05:45,036 --> 01:05:47,036
And I have a surprise.

830
01:05:47,723 --> 01:05:50,648
You've been in here before,
haven't you?

831
01:05:52,171 --> 01:05:54,171
Oh, Malee.

832
01:05:54,764 --> 01:05:58,439
Malee, you gotta...
you gotta put on your clothes.

833
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,708
Don't you like my body?

834
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,551
Now, Malee.

835
01:06:10,507 --> 01:06:12,507
It's okay.

836
01:06:13,772 --> 01:06:15,772
I love you.

837
01:06:17,227 --> 01:06:20,194
Malee. Stop.

838
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:34,556
Touch me.

839
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,115
Where are you going?

840
01:07:02,028 --> 01:07:04,028
To call your mother.

841
01:07:09,452 --> 01:07:11,452
But we're soul mates.

842
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:38,793
I... I don't even...
know what to say.

843
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:07,836
It's alive.

844
01:08:09,643 --> 01:08:12,131
What happened?
- Gas leak.

845
01:08:12,204 --> 01:08:14,055
My mom, is she...
- She'll be fine.

846
01:08:14,155 --> 01:08:15,623
She broke her hip
and a few ribs.

847
01:08:15,723 --> 01:08:18,216
We're trying to get your father
on the phone right now.

848
01:08:18,316 --> 01:08:21,163
I have to see her.
- Shh.

849
01:08:21,868 --> 01:08:23,751
You need your rest.

850
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:25,956
Everything is fine now.

851
01:08:47,051 --> 01:08:48,071
Uh, you know, it's...

852
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:49,511
Before we begin, I
want to apologize...

853
01:08:49,611 --> 01:08:51,786
You know what? It's my fault.

854
01:08:52,107 --> 01:08:54,582
Uh, I knew she
had a crush on me.

855
01:08:56,108 --> 01:08:59,033
I... I just felt bad
for her, you know?

856
01:09:01,228 --> 01:09:03,228
She's a very lonely girl.

857
01:09:05,772 --> 01:09:09,863
If it's any consolation, uh...

858
01:09:09,931 --> 01:09:13,231
the whole thing
was kinda therapeutic for me.

859
01:09:14,956 --> 01:09:17,443
Right.

860
01:09:17,515 --> 01:09:18,439
Sorry.

861
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:20,039
I, uh...

862
01:09:20,139 --> 01:09:22,139
It's okay.

863
01:09:22,796 --> 01:09:25,032
It's your therapy, not mine.

864
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:31,446
Well, so, how was
it therapeutic?

865
01:09:33,196 --> 01:09:37,319
I don't remember the last time
I slept so deep and so sound.

866
01:09:37,419 --> 01:09:39,272
Don't remember dreaming.

867
01:09:39,372 --> 01:09:41,372
Nothing.

868
01:09:41,484 --> 01:09:43,484
Why do you think that is?

869
01:09:48,139 --> 01:09:50,599
One of the last fires
I ever fought...

870
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:52,699
was a brownstone.

871
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,939
Whole families wiped out.

872
01:09:56,683 --> 01:10:00,229
During the inspection,
I went upstairs.

873
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:04,219
And I found a little girl.

874
01:10:05,963 --> 01:10:08,381
The whole right
side of her face...

875
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:10,481
was burned off.

876
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:13,819
But her eyes were open.

877
01:10:16,204 --> 01:10:18,204
She was still alive.

878
01:10:22,924 --> 01:10:24,924
Uh...

879
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:32,175
You know that the... the pain
must've been...

880
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:34,972
...excruciating.

881
01:10:35,756 --> 01:10:37,756
You know?

882
01:10:47,563 --> 01:10:50,728
She was... she was
begging for me...

883
01:10:50,828 --> 01:10:52,828
to... to kill her.

884
01:10:56,876 --> 01:10:58,876
And what did you do?

885
01:11:03,787 --> 01:11:06,112
I did what she
wanted me to do.

886
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,140
I killed her.

887
01:11:21,132 --> 01:11:22,590
I kept telling myself...

888
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:24,903
that that was the
right thing to do.

889
01:11:25,003 --> 01:11:27,003
You know, it's... just...

890
01:11:33,067 --> 01:11:35,067
But, uh...

891
01:11:35,243 --> 01:11:37,243
I've never been so sure.

892
01:11:40,651 --> 01:11:42,023
I'm sorry.

893
01:11:42,123 --> 01:11:44,360
Gus, that's devastating.

894
01:11:49,003 --> 01:11:52,003
What does all this have to do
with Malee?

895
01:11:54,923 --> 01:11:57,023
When I saw her last night...

896
01:11:59,755 --> 01:12:02,481
...she had the same
look on her face...

897
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:04,581
as that little girl.

898
01:12:05,515 --> 01:12:08,515
She just wanted me
to take her pain away.

899
01:12:17,739 --> 01:12:19,739
Doctor?

900
01:12:25,643 --> 01:12:29,468
I heard it's supposed to rain,
so I packed a poncho.

901
01:12:33,036 --> 01:12:36,071
You're acting weird, man.
You're not gonna be a chicken.

902
01:12:36,171 --> 01:12:38,171
No.

903
01:12:40,395 --> 01:12:43,470
I'm telling you, man,
it's gonna be great.

904
01:12:45,163 --> 01:12:46,951
You ain't gonna be
a pussy, right?

905
01:12:47,051 --> 01:12:49,051
No.

906
01:13:04,587 --> 01:13:05,672
Wanna play some catch?

907
01:13:05,772 --> 01:13:08,322
Where the hell did
you get that? !

908
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:11,896
Did I say you could touch this?
Did I? !

909
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:14,135
Okay, everything... and
I mean everything...

910
01:13:14,235 --> 01:13:15,207
in this house is mine.

911
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:16,647
You got it?

912
01:13:16,747 --> 01:13:19,472
You are not allowed
to touch a thing,

913
01:13:19,572 --> 01:13:21,572
including this glove!

914
01:13:30,923 --> 01:13:32,923
What's wrong now?

915
01:13:33,963 --> 01:13:36,352
I was just looking at a picture...

916
01:13:36,452 --> 01:13:39,077
of you and Rudy
when you were born.

917
01:13:39,403 --> 01:13:41,403
God, I miss him.

918
01:13:42,027 --> 01:13:44,027
But you have Keith now.

919
01:13:45,099 --> 01:13:46,471
What the hell does that mean?

920
01:13:46,571 --> 01:13:48,391
You have Keith.

921
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:50,471
Two boys again.
Everything's fine.

922
01:13:50,571 --> 01:13:53,095
We didn't adopt Keith
to replace Rudy.

923
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,536
Didn't you?

924
01:13:54,636 --> 01:13:57,127
No. Your father and I
discussed adoption for years.

925
01:13:57,227 --> 01:13:58,791
Honey, we... we told you that.

926
01:13:58,891 --> 01:14:00,135
Right.

927
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,128
Maybe if it was me that
died, you wouldn't...

928
01:14:02,228 --> 01:14:03,559
need another kid to get over it.

929
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:05,287
What are you talking about?

930
01:14:05,387 --> 01:14:07,431
I wouldn't wish that
on any of my children.

931
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:09,531
But one of us died.

932
01:14:09,963 --> 01:14:12,471
And I bet if you could
choose which one,

933
01:14:12,571 --> 01:14:13,736
you wish it was me.

934
01:14:13,836 --> 01:14:15,875
You know what? I...

935
01:14:17,707 --> 01:14:19,655
I know that you feel
we favored Rudy.

936
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:20,999
You did! Admit it.

937
01:14:21,099 --> 01:14:22,523
I admit that he was
easier to raise,

938
01:14:22,623 --> 01:14:24,007
but that doesn't
we loved him more.

939
01:14:24,107 --> 01:14:25,695
Honey, Jacob, you were born...

940
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,655
with a different
set of challenges.

941
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:28,775
My birthmark?
- Yes.

942
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:30,407
And it's not easy
being different.

943
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,507
I'm not different!

944
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:33,684
You always made it seem...

945
01:14:33,784 --> 01:14:34,759
like there was
something wrong!

946
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:36,135
There's nothing
wrong with me!

947
01:14:36,235 --> 01:14:38,485
I know that...
- No, you don't!

948
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:41,959
It's like you don't know
what to do with me.

949
01:14:42,059 --> 01:14:43,175
You never did.

950
01:14:43,275 --> 01:14:45,095
Well, I'm sorry that
you feel that way.

951
01:14:45,195 --> 01:14:45,506
You know,

952
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:46,919
you do what you
can as a parent...

953
01:14:47,019 --> 01:14:49,191
and sometimes you don't
always make the right choices,

954
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:51,365
but you are my son
and I love you,

955
01:14:51,465 --> 01:14:53,415
and I would do
anything for you.

956
01:14:53,515 --> 01:14:56,765
I would fight for you,
I would kill for you,

957
01:14:56,865 --> 01:14:58,865
I'd die for you!

958
01:15:00,715 --> 01:15:03,115
Rudy used to say
the same thing.

959
01:15:04,683 --> 01:15:06,683
And he was right.

960
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:11,044
And as un-Christian
as it sounds,

961
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:13,144
I still want the...

962
01:15:13,387 --> 01:15:15,562
...boy that killed Rudy dead.

963
01:15:17,995 --> 01:15:20,039
And someday, when
you grow up,

964
01:15:20,139 --> 01:15:22,139
you'll understand that.

965
01:15:26,187 --> 01:15:28,187
Someday.

966
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:10,779
A week?

967
01:16:11,339 --> 01:16:13,063
No...

968
01:16:13,163 --> 01:16:15,788
Dad. Dad, I can
take a train alone.

969
01:16:18,411 --> 01:16:20,199
I understand.

970
01:16:20,299 --> 01:16:22,299
You, too.

971
01:16:28,842 --> 01:16:30,842
He really hates me.

972
01:16:31,179 --> 01:16:33,179
He doesn't hate you.

973
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,391
I'm just gonna go see him.

974
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:38,662
That is not a good idea.

975
01:16:40,619 --> 01:16:43,685
He doesn't wanna
see me. Fine.

976
01:16:43,755 --> 01:16:47,430
I just want him to
look me in the eyes and say it.

977
01:16:50,667 --> 01:16:53,287
I can handle it, Ma.
- You don't know him.

978
01:16:53,387 --> 01:16:55,387
That's the problem.

979
01:16:56,587 --> 01:17:00,337
Aren't you sick of being
angry at him all the time?

980
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:09,083
He hurt me.

981
01:17:17,323 --> 01:17:19,948
But you have to
take me to see him.

982
01:17:20,715 --> 01:17:22,715
You have to.

983
01:17:26,955 --> 01:17:28,955
Okay.

984
01:18:12,683 --> 01:18:14,683
You're late.

985
01:18:15,115 --> 01:18:17,115
Put this on.

986
01:18:31,147 --> 01:18:33,147
What the fuck is that?

987
01:18:34,347 --> 01:18:35,847
You didn't bring a disguise?

988
01:18:35,947 --> 01:18:38,572
No one gives a shit
what I'm up to.

989
01:18:48,267 --> 01:18:50,267
Where are you going?

990
01:18:51,659 --> 01:18:53,127
The main road's this way.

991
01:18:53,227 --> 01:18:55,207
Yeah, but if we cut
through the construction site,

992
01:18:55,307 --> 01:18:57,639
we'll hit the railroad
tracks faster.

993
01:18:57,739 --> 01:18:59,431
Good point.

994
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:01,531
After you.

995
01:19:25,259 --> 01:19:27,259
I'm sorry, Mom.

996
01:19:29,355 --> 01:19:31,355
I just wanted to help you.

997
01:19:34,507 --> 01:19:35,590
I spoke with your father.

998
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:38,115
He and the girls caught a flight.

999
01:19:38,215 --> 01:19:40,540
They should be
here by morning.

1000
01:19:40,715 --> 01:19:43,040
Did you tell him
what happened?

1001
01:19:43,243 --> 01:19:45,643
I told him there was a gas leak.

1002
01:19:46,795 --> 01:19:48,795
I meant the...

1003
01:19:49,163 --> 01:19:51,163
I know what you meant.

1004
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:54,010
I didn't tell him.

1005
01:19:54,251 --> 01:19:56,251
I don't think I will.

1006
01:19:59,755 --> 01:20:01,755
Are you mad?

1007
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:06,138
You know...

1008
01:20:06,987 --> 01:20:10,303
Even if I could
manage the food...

1009
01:20:11,883 --> 01:20:15,108
...can you really see me
running a marathon?

1010
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:20,647
You just have to run
to the end of the block.

1011
01:20:20,747 --> 01:20:23,447
It's not as hard as
you think it is.

1012
01:20:24,939 --> 01:20:26,939
Easy for you to say.

1013
01:20:30,475 --> 01:20:32,475
No.

1014
01:20:32,555 --> 01:20:34,555
It's not.

1015
01:20:40,651 --> 01:20:42,651
Okay.

1016
01:20:42,955 --> 01:20:44,955
I'll try.

1017
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:53,659
Ow, ow, ow.

1018
01:21:08,043 --> 01:21:10,043
Son of a bitch!

1019
01:21:10,986 --> 01:21:12,986
I knew you'd chicken out.

1020
01:21:18,699 --> 01:21:20,199
Where'd you get that shit?

1021
01:21:20,299 --> 01:21:22,299
Is that real?

1022
01:21:37,418 --> 01:21:39,418
You killed him.

1023
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:42,363
Come on, man.
Stop jo...
