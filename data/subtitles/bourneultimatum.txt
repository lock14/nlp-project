the victim is 35-year-old

journalist based here
in London

with the Guardian newspaper.

347
00:29:26,793 --> 00:29:29,387
It appears that
he was gunned down

348
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:32,124
right in the middle of the
Waterloo Station concourse

unsavory stories about terror

353

Can I take your order?
Yes.

I'm good.

361
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,377
So, when the Director called
and it was suggested that
we bring you on...

362
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:32,424
- Suggested?
- You sure it was just a suggestion?

a favor for you, Pam,

to complete some unfinished
business.

He's a threat.

369
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:57,940
And we both want
the same thing.

370
00:30:58,017 --> 00:31:00,577

in two very different ways.

Pam. All right?

372
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:05,621
We were careless
in Stockholm.

373
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:07,353
So what was Waterloo?
Just careless again?

374
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:10,794
We had a leak. A serious
national security situation.

375
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:13,731
Bourne showed up on our
surveillance and we had
very little time to react.

The question is what
was he doing there?

378
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:20,605
PAMELA: No, the real question
is how you managed

379
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:23,164
to get into a firefight
at a public train station.

380

time are never perfect.

Ross in Turin for breakfast

415

and then at noon the same day
Bourne calls Ross to demand
a meet at Waterloo?
