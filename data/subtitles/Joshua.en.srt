1
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:03,265
You're playing like
a bunch of little girls!

2
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:06,917
You're playing like a little girl!

3
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,361
Good, good hustle.

4
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,274
Good hustle!

5
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,429
Hustle!

6
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,480
What? Okay, I'm coming!
Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry.

7
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:22,244
Excuse me!

8
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:23,240
We got to go.

9
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:24,199
Sorry.
We've got to go!

10
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:27,047
It's an emergency!

11
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,015
Come on, come on, buddy.

12
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,896
Hey!

13
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:37,790
Joshua, let's go!

14
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:39,554
Let's go, buddy.

15
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:40,768
Josh!

16
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:42,049
Oh...

17
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:43,581
Ah...

18
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:24,084
Oh, my little worm.

19
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,004
Oh, God, I love her so much.

20
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,965
Hello, sweetie.

21
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,752
She looks like...

22
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:35,380
She...

23
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:41,879
Look at this little...

24
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:45,332
Hey.

25
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:48,153
Did it hurt, Mommy?

26
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:53,205
Oh, yeah, it did, but not anymore.

27
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,818
Oh, you did?

28
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,391
Oh, not you, Buster.

29
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,569
Oh, Buster!

30
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:14,161
Baby, I thought we were
keeping him locked up.

31
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:15,443
Okay, okay.

32
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:18,807
You been listening to Bartok?

33
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:22,765
I'll see your Bartok

34
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:27,826
and raise you one
Rodgers and Hammerstein.

35
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:30,295
You hammer any
of these nails yourself?

36
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:32,530
Uh, no, Dad, we had a contractor.

37
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:34,519
I can't imagine what that cost you.

38
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:36,786
Shame, nothing like putting
your own sweat into a home.

39
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:40,563
Oh, there's sweat in here,
believe me.

40
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,805
HAZEL: By the way it's not rare
to have a grandmother

41
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:49,040
stay and help with the newborn.

42
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,051
- Oh, no...
- It would be my pleasure.

43
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,401
No, Hazel.

44
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,028
We're fine.

45
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:55,278
Are you sure, Abby?

46
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:56,875
Yes, Mom, we'll be fine.

47
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:00,297
Because, you should have help.

48
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:01,419
No.

49
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:05,038
HAZEL: At least have a nanny.

50
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,929
I mean, isn't that what
rich people do in New York?

51
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:08,686
- Mom, we're fine, really.
- We're also not crazy

52
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:12,432
about this idea of
a stranger living here.

53
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:14,987
Well, you would hardly notice me.

54
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,459
These ten little Indians
are all out of arrows.

55
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:24,108
Well, I hope you won't
make me sing, Ned.

56
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,185
A glorious light
should shine, Hazel.

57
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,682
You flatterer.

58
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,680
NED:
You know, I don't know

59
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:30,922
if you were interested
in seeing a show.

60
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:32,171
I can get you tickets.

61
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:34,924
HAZEL: I only want to see
one of your shows, Ned.

62
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:37,327
Well, you're three years
too late on that one.

63
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:39,280
Aw, but what a success.

64
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:43,852
Mmm, I suppose.

65
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:47,465
Oh, this is the piece that he's
playing for the school recital.

66
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:51,496
Uh-huh. Can he play, like,
"Jesus is my Savior" or...

67
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,345
I don't think so, Mom.

68
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:55,592
Oh, that's a shame.

69
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:01,194
Abby, do you think

70
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,978
you could part with that
bundle of joy for just a second?

71
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,802
I need some cuddle time.

72
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:08,552
Oh!

73
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:14,404
Oh, precious little lady.

74
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,331
Look at you!

75
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:20,204
Oh, well, she sure has that
solid-as-a-rock Cairn chin,

76
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,642
doesn't she?

77
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,918
JOE:
You can tell she's salt of the earth.

78
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,036
You can just tell.

79
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,711
So, sis... how is everything?

80
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:30,634
Fine, how are you?

81
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:32,674
I'm fine, how are you feeling?

82
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,648
I'm feeling fine.
I'm good... I am.

83
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:37,130
Neddy, I'm good, I'm great even.

84
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:38,852
No blues? No blahs?

85
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:40,199
Nope.

86
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,721
'Cause I have some exquisite
medication I can get you.

87
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:45,445
No, it's nothing like last time.

88
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:46,823
Nothing.

89
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:48,264
Good.

90
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:53,634
ABBY:
Joshua.

91
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:55,680
Do you think we could have
a little intermission?

92
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:57,247
Hmm?

93
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,622
I wonder how many rats
live in this building?

94
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:00,615
Joshua.

95
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:01,826
I'm guessing at least a hundred.

96
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:03,041
Joshua!

97
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:07,367
Do you think we can keep
it quiet for the baby?

98
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,306
HAZEL:
What's that?

99
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:12,896
Lunch break is probably over.

100
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,788
That's, uh...

101
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:16,197
that's gut renovation
on the penthouse.

102
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:17,473
JOE:
How charming.

103
00:07:17,576 --> 00:07:21,317
You baptizing this one?

104
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:23,684
Oh, well, you know, since we
didn't baptizeJoshua, we're...

105
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:25,605
ABBY:
Yeah, I think it's time for Lily's nap.

106
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:27,197
So that's a no to baptism?

107
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:29,636
Uh, I think, you know, we're going to let

108
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,905
our kids make up their
own minds about religion.

109
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:34,656
Hey, why don't we all
sing Lily a sleep tight song?

110
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:36,132
ABBY:
Good idea.

111
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,855
NED:
Come on, everybody.

112
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,477
- Come on.
- All right.

113
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:43,428
It's going to be okay.

114
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:46,786
It's okay, Ma.

115
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:52,994
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

116
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:57,248
How I wonder what you are

117
00:07:57,348 --> 00:08:01,755
Up above the world so high

118
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:05,852
Like a diamond in the sky

119
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:07,547
Twinkle, twinkle...

120
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:09,920
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my Lord.

121
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:13,466
Sorry. I'm sorry.

122
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:21,472
You feeling better?

123
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:25,915
What's going on over here?

124
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:27,293
Did you feed Nero today?

125
00:08:27,393 --> 00:08:29,531
Yeah?

126
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,778
Dad?

127
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,829
Yeah.

128
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:33,725
I don't like soccer.

129
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:36,574
I- I thought I did,

130
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:39,671
and I wanted to...
but I don't.

131
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:42,426
Oh...

132
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:45,843
Well, you know, that's...

133
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:48,318
that's okay, you know?

134
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,975
I don't like baseball either.

135
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:55,387
Well, that's all right.

136
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:57,461
You ch... you do something else.

137
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,867
You can do whatever you want.

138
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:00,826
You know?

139
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,932
Do you ever feel weird, Dad?

140
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:04,563
Weird?

141
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,163
Yeah, yeah, sometimes.

142
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:08,657
Like if I don't exercise
for a while

143
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,423
or wake up in the middle
of a dream...

144
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:15,281
or have too much
coffee or something.

145
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,624
Do you ever feel weird about me?

146
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:21,690
Your weird son?

147
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:24,665
No.

148
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:27,632
No, no, no, no, not at all.

149
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:29,047
Not at all.

150
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:31,503
You know that magic trick

151
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:33,269
where the magician puts
the person in the box

152
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,672
and spins the box
and makes the person disappear?

153
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,751
Yeah?

154
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,451
I know how that trick is done.

155
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:41,171
If you look carefully, you can tell.

156
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:43,095
Well, you know, hey,
maybe magic is your thing.

157
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:44,622
We could take you to a magic store.

158
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,584
Get you some tricks.

159
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,779
You know, you don't have to love me.

160
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,735
That's not like a rule or something.

161
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:52,780
But I do love you.

162
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:54,034
You're my son. You're my boy.

163
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,405
I'll always love you,
no matter what.

164
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:01,522
Okay?

165
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:20,943
Brad.

166
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:22,452
Mm?

167
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:23,410
Brad.

168
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:24,753
Hmm?

169
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:25,933
Do you hear that?

170
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:27,280
Hmm? What?

171
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:29,290
I think there's someone
in the baby's room.

172
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:32,586
No, that's static, sweetie.

173
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,318
No, there's someone in Lily's room.

174
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:36,526
Abby, wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

175
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:38,537
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

176
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:39,821
Sweetie?

177
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:42,160
Abby.

178
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:45,161
Damn it.

179
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:53,194
She's breathing, right?

180
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:54,411
She's fine, sweetie.

181
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:57,035
She's fine.

182
00:10:57,138 --> 00:11:00,367
I thought she was choking
or something.

183
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:03,400
It's amazing how tiny they are.

184
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:05,709
ABBY:
It's almost heartbreaking.

185
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:44,619
Hey, did you walk the dog?

186
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:46,605
Okay, let's roll, little man.

187
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,255
Oh.

188
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:55,429
Oh, don't cry.

189
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,941
Um, yeah, put it on the...
put it on the desk.

190
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:01,189
All right, thanks a lot.

191
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,601
Listen, hey, I'm running late.

192
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,871
I got to... Okay.

193
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:06,248
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

194
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:07,940
High five. Down low.

195
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,726
Two. Hey, hey, come on.

196
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:11,906
You all right?

197
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,320
Okay.

198
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:15,306
I'll see you later.

199
00:12:16,426 --> 00:12:17,767
Hey!

200
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:32,007
Did you solve them all already?

201
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:38,335
And ten million's the minimum
for this particular fund.

202
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,827
Of course... of course
we would love your support,

203
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,073
but ten is the number.

204
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:44,702
It's not six.

205
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:51,332
Yeah.

206
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,139
WOMAN:
Okay, now let's

207
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,156
take a moment talking
about how and why

208
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:05,953
these ancient people
embalmed their dead.

209
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,068
BOY:
Mummies?

210
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:09,115
Yes, mummies.

211
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:28,734
Oh, you're like a bird
trapped in a garage.

212
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:30,209
Yeah. That's...

213
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,801
Come on.
Serve.

214
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:16,958
Hey.

215
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:18,200
Hey, I didn't see you there.

216
00:14:18,302 --> 00:14:19,611
ABBY:
Brad...

217
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,139
- BRAD: Sweetie, I'm...
- It ricochets.

218
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:22,326
I'm cultured, I swear.

219
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,858
See?

220
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,673
God.

221
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:29,367
You know,
someone died in this apartment.

222
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,484
BRAD:
Oh, yeah?

223
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,175
Really?

224
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:35,416
I- I-I... I'm pretty sure
that's not true.

225
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:37,458
If you think
about it,

226
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:39,387
someone has died

227
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:42,037
on pretty much every inch
of this planet.

228
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,627
You know, dig down anywhere,
and you'll find bones.

229
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,987
ABBY:
I don't know. I think you...

230
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:50,840
We'd probably know if
someone was killed here.

231
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,281
I didn't say killed.

232
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,096
Why do you think killed?

233
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,017
Do you have that sense, too?

234
00:14:59,002 --> 00:15:01,107
Nobody died here, man.

235
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,258
Are you sure?

236
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:03,540
ABBY
I'm pretty sure.

237
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:04,787
Kind of sure.

238
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,155
What? Tell him about it.

239
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:10,929
Tell him about your shots.

240
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,440
She had her shots today.

241
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,465
BRAD:
Oh, yeah?

242
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,901
Yeah. She was so good.

243
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,277
- I was a mess, however.
- Ah...

244
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:18,003
Oh, you poor thing.

245
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:20,209
What was I like as a baby?

246
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:21,327
BRAD:
You were great.

247
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:22,360
You were... you were very, uh...

248
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,496
You had a lot of... spirit.

249
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:27,984
You certainly knew
what you wanted,

250
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:29,233
that's for sure.

251
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:30,480
What did I want?

252
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,990
Ah...

253
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:34,389
We could never tell.

254
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:37,007
But I was all right?

255
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:38,420
You...

256
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:39,729
Yeah.

257
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,975
ABBY
You were fine.

258
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,508
BRAD:
You were great.

259
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:43,726
You really were.

260
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,764
You were a good kid.

261
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,648
BRAD: Oh, yes, here we are
with Joshua, eight days old.

262
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:27,055
BRAD:
Mommy... and son.

263
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,456
ABBY:
Brad, what are you doing?

264
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:32,750
BRAD I'm just trying
to get a slice of life here, you see.

265
00:16:32,849 --> 00:16:33,864
Well, not now.

266
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,376
Please just get out of here.

267
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:39,920
BRAD: Mommy's very tired,
very tired, and she's trying to...

268
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:41,194
ABBY:
Brad, fuck off.

269
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:43,718
BRAD:
Just give a little... Okay. Okay.

270
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:44,970
Just leave me alone right now.

271
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,217
BRAD:
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.

272
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,290
BRAD
I'll stop, I'll stop, I'll stop.

273
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:51,301
BRAD:
And here we are behind the scenes

274
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,644
with Brad and Abby Cairn.

275
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:54,758

276
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:56,237
BRAD:
Okay, okay, okay...

277
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:57,611
BRAD: Ow!

278
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:59,085
ABBY:
Get out!

279
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:12,809
ABBY:
I'm fine, I'm fine.

280
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:15,757
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

281
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:16,868
I'm fine.

282
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:23,559
I'm fine. I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.

283
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,519
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

284
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:47,775
What's going on with you?

285
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:50,402
MAN:
Hey, it's the new parents.

286
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:52,328
- BRAD: Hey, how you been?
- Brad!

287
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:54,214
BRAD:
Fred, Ruth, how you guys doing? Hey...

288
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:55,938
- Hello, Abernathys.
- WOMAN: Hello.

289
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,056
Where you guys been?

290
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,339
- South Africa.
- BRAD: Oh, nice.

291
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:00,001
My mother finally died.

292
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:01,120
Oh, sorry.

293
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,272
The weather was unbelievable.

294
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:04,231
I caught the biggest
shark you've ever seen.

295
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:06,117
- Mm. Really...?
- WOMAN: So, how's the new girl?

296
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:07,231
It's Lily, right?

297
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,481
ABBY:
Yeah. She's good.

298
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:10,078
You look fabulous.

00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:11,296
- Yeah.

300
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,025
- Thank you.
- BRAD: What do you use for...?

301
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:14,753
- Well, you finally had another. That's great.
- Yeah.

302
00:18:14,856 --> 00:18:16,895
MAN: It took me three hours
to bring in that shark.

303
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:18,013
Hey, how's Tommy?

304
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,526
Well, we'll see. Uh...

305
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:20,931
The trumpet was a real mistake.

306
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:22,340
There is a reason

307
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:24,326
that nobody plays the trumpet.

308
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:27,422
So, are we all prepared for
an hour of unspeakable music?

309
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:29,468
Speak for your own child.

310
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:32,771
I tell you, two kids really
changes everything, huh?

311
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:34,331
MAN: Try three.

312
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:37,019
All right, we'll see you out there.

313
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,303
- Okay.
- Break a leg.

314
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:40,293
- Okay.
- BRAD: Okay.

315
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:42,752
I hate these people.

316
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:44,925
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, keep it down.

317
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,370
Are we these people?

318
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:47,613
It's just a school, baby.

319
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:48,730
Hey, bullshit.

320
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,243
It is not just a school.

321
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,834
- It's a way of life.
- Shh, shh.

322
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,111
And we're smack dab
in the middle of it.

323
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:55,968
- Hi.
- Hey.

324
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,578
There he is.

325
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:01,755
Sorry, I'm late, sis.

326
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:02,938
Yeah, whatever.

327
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,384
You're right on time.

328
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:31,639
# Ave Maria #

329
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:36,500
# Gratia plena... #

330
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,314
What's he doing?

331
00:20:09,564 --> 00:20:11,833
Uh, I don't know.

332
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:51,447
BRAD:
This is... This is...

333
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:53,267
This is all...
This is all wrong.

334
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,723
No. Actually, I think he's...

335
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:59,311
he's hitting every note.

336
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:39,378
ABBY:
Joshua? Oh,Joshua...

337
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:45,809
MAN:
Excuse me!

338
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:49,291
BRAD:
You all right?

339
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:50,409
Hey, hey.

340
00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:51,529
- ABBY: You okay?
- You're okay.

341
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:52,812
He's okay.
You okay, buddy?

342
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:54,059
Say something.

343
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:55,788
- You okay?
- Come on, buddy, let's go.

344
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,581
Bring him... Just let me bring him.

345
00:21:57,681 --> 00:22:00,332
MAN:
First I thought he was kidding around with...

346
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:05,611
What were you doing up there?

347
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:07,403
You were probably just nervous, huh?

348
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:08,650
NED:
Hey,

349
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:11,403
I threw up the first time
I ever went on stage.

350
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:14,218
- Oh!
- Hey, hey, hey.

351
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,530
Goddamn it.

352
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:18,185
Will you not drive like
a fucking idiot, please?!

353
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:51,593
Please. Oh, oh, oh, baby.

354
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,219
Honey, honey, honey.

355
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:54,568
Honey, honey, honey, honey.

356

- What's wrong?
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

357
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:57,665
Nothing. She just started crying.

358
00:22:57,772 --> 00:22:59,081
- What did you do?
- Shh, shh.

359
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,227
I didn't do anything. I...

360
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:01,509
Well, she's fine.

361
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:03,521
- I fed her not too long ago.
- Shh, shh, shh.

362
00:23:03,627 --> 00:23:05,154
- Here... No, no, no.
- No, I can do it.

363
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,885
- I can do it, sweetie.
- No, no. Here, let me.

364
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:08,776
- I can do it.
- Let me have her.

365
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,304
- She's fine.
- What's going on with her?

366
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:12,167
Is it night terrors or something?
What's happening?

367
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,859
No. She's fine,
she's fine, she's fine.

368
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:14,976
She doesn't like it...

369
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:16,576
She likes it when you
support her h...

370
00:23:16,682 --> 00:23:17,959
She's fine, she's fine.
I'm fine, okay?!

371
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:19,072
I can handle this.

372
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:21,000
Just go to bed!

373
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:26,047
Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

374
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:27,844
Come on, baby...

375
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:36,577
- Dad?
- Jesus.

376
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,502
Oh God, you scared the...

377
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,422
tar out of me.

378
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,080
Everything all right?

379
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:45,183
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

380
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:46,301
How're you feeling?

381
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:48,229
You feel, you feel better?

382
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,636
She's crying.

383
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:51,229
Yes, she is.

384
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:54,844
Come on, buddy,
back to bed, let's go.

385
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:00,416
So how long has she been crying now?

386
00:24:00,518 --> 00:24:02,340
- Uh, five days.
- Hmm.

387
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:04,739
Yeah, she has a slight diaper rash.

388
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:06,113
You think that, that's it?

389
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:07,707
- Could that be it?
- Well...

390
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,242
you know, um...

391
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:11,738
some babies just like to cry.

392
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:13,187
Yeah.

393
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:15,106
Here you go.

394
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,946
Not this, not again.

395
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:20,866
Not, not this one.

396
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:22,786
You know, she was,
she was perfect

397
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:24,705
until five days ago.

398
00:24:24,803 --> 00:24:26,625
Maybe she just has a lot to say.

399
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:28,545
Okay.

400
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:30,552
Could you take her for a second?

401
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,513
Yeah, sure.

402
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:50,837
Where have you been?

403
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:53,968
Hey, what's...

404
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,032
What is that, is that the,
is that the baby

405
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,316
- or the dog?
- Or me?

406
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:00,595
- What?
- Take a deep breath, Brad.

407
00:26:00,698 --> 00:26:01,876
That's our life you're smelling.

408
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,058
Give me the binky.

409
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,089
Wait.

410
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:06,673
Good God, ma...

411
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:08,949
Mommy's upset, huh?

412
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:11,504
Oh, no, little baby.

413
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:13,103
Look we have the binky.

414
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:14,703
The binky's here.

415
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:15,986
There's the binky.

416
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:17,037
Yeah.

417
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,639
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

418
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:32,630
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

419
00:26:38,103 --> 00:26:39,597
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

420
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:41,524
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

421
00:26:41,622 --> 00:26:43,509
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

422
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,442
Hey, pal.

423
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,361
Hi.

424
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:10,801
What's going on here?

425
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,077
What are you...

426
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,001
what are you doing
with all your stuff?

427
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,921
I'm giving it away,

428
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:17,841
to the poor.

429
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:19,826
You're giving it away to the poor?

430
00:27:19,922 --> 00:27:21,580
Every one of your toys?

431
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,399
Josh...

432
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:27,279
You know, these,
these toys aren't cheap.

433
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:29,199
I'm starting over.

434
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:30,245
Starting over?

435
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:31,336
From what?

436
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,456
Mom said I could.

437
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:35,016
Mom said you could.

438
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:37,292
Uh-huh.

439
00:27:37,392 --> 00:27:39,727
Yeah, of course she did, well...

440
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,671
at least you're keeping Pandy.

441
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:47,909
Dad, is Mommy all right?

442
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,838
Yeah, yeah,

443
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:51,758
she's just tired, pal.

444
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:53,677
Why do you ask?

445
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:55,597
Nothing.

446
00:27:55,695 --> 00:27:57,320
Lily asleep?

447
00:27:57,423 --> 00:27:59,245
Yeah, I got her to fall asleep.

448
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:00,357
Pretty good, huh?

449
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:02,285
You're better at it than Mommy.

450
00:28:03,886 --> 00:28:05,260
I'm not sure about that.

451
00:28:05,358 --> 00:28:06,787
You are. Really.

452
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,748
What's going on with your hair here?

453
00:28:08,846 --> 00:28:11,301
Huh, what is it, made of plastic?

454
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:13,707
Hey, I know things have
been kind of stressful

455
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:15,430
around here lately.

456
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:18,380
It can't be easy for you.

457
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,802
You okay?

458
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,722
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

459
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,642
What are you...
what are you doing?

460
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,754
In Egypt,

461
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,682
when they embalmed
people, like pharaohs,

462
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,602
they broke the nose
and removed the brain

463
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:32,521
through the opening.

464
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:33,961
Ahh.

465
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,882
Josh, that's...

466
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,801
They drained the body
of all its fluid

467
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:40,070
on a special stone slab.

468
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:41,578
Josh...

469
00:28:41,675 --> 00:28:43,333
Josh,Josh,

470
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:44,928
Josh, wh-wh-why are you doing that?

471
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:46,528
Why... don't...

472
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:49,481
This guarantees him
a glorious afterlife.

473
00:28:57,353 --> 00:28:59,175
They chanted
something, too,

474
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:01,095
but I'm making that part up.

475
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,062
Filthy animal.

476
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,982
You filthy, filthy animal.

477
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,054
Oh...

478
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,047
That's right.

479
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:13,184
You're a disgusting dog.

480
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,225
No, no, Brad!

481
00:29:16,327 --> 00:29:17,985
- Huh?
- Buster.

482
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:19,101
No!

483
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:20,221
What's wrong?

484
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:21,756
All right, come on, come on.

485
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:22,877
Come on, Buster.

486
00:29:22,982 --> 00:29:24,869
Let's go, come on.

487
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:30,310
I mean can't your parents take him?

488
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:33,635
No.

489
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:35,555
They can't take him.

490
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:38,820
What's wrong, sweetie?

491
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:41,979
Nice that everything is quiet.

492
00:29:42,084 --> 00:29:43,426
Ugh, are you kidding me?

493
00:29:43,525 --> 00:29:45,347
I still hear her echo.

494
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:47,746
Sweetie, what's, what's going on?

495
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:49,305
You okay?

496
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,234
I love you bunches.

497
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,673
I love ya.

498
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:55,451
Sweetie.

499
00:29:55,555 --> 00:29:57,377
Look at this, this is beautiful.

500
00:29:57,475 --> 00:30:00,125
All right, come on, that's my side.

501
00:30:00,227 --> 00:30:01,503
Let's go.

502
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:02,879
I'm gonna take a look at this.

503
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:04,670
Let me get, let me get
a little slice of this.

504
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,144
Please.

505
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:07,257
Don't worry
about Lily,

506
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:08,704
I'm gonna feed her tonight, okay.

507
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:10,776
Okay, but you have
to warm the breast milk.

508
00:30:10,882 --> 00:30:12,769
No problem.

509
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:16,248
You look so good.

510
00:30:16,353 --> 00:30:17,695
Look at this, voluptuous.

511
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:18,970
This is so nice.

512
00:30:19,073 --> 00:30:20,895
That's Latin for fat pig.

513
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:23,131
No, baby, this is
just good clean fun.

514
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:24,410
This is beautiful.

515
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,006
It's love.

516
00:30:26,113 --> 00:30:27,935
Come on, sweetie.

517
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:29,854
Not in the mood, huh?

518
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:32,734
Oh, we can't have sex anyway.

519
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,654
Well, we can do other things.

520
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,574
You know, like...

521
00:30:36,672 --> 00:30:38,166
stuff.

522
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:39,449
You know...

523
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:40,566
Do you hear that?

524
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,492
What?

525
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,565
I think someone's upstairs.

526
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,645
Yeah, well, maybe
it's the owners

527
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,244
checking up on the progress.

528
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,008
At 10:30?

529
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,801
You know I love the
smell of your pits.

530
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,178
- Brad...
- Maybe it's rats, I don't know.

531
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:54,554
Maybe, there's got
to be a hundred

532
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:55,766
in this building.

533
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,211
- Don't worry about it.
- No, not now, okay.

534
00:30:57,309 --> 00:30:59,513
May- Maybe soon but not now.

535
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:04,347
Okay.

536
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:22,810
Hey!

537
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:25,712
Not good, huh?

538
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,477
No, no, it was...

539
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:29,072
It was an aggressive position,

540
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,290
but it'll work out.

541
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:32,182
- I hope.
- Hey, I got to take off

542
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:33,296
- early.
- Yeah?

543
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:34,417
Yeah.

544
00:31:34,522 --> 00:31:35,318
Reason?

545
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:36,912
Teacher-parent meeting.

546
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:38,130
Send the nanny,

547
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:39,094
that's what I do.

548
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:40,403
That's funny.

549
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:41,749
Not a joke.

550
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:45,046
It'll be up a point
by the time the market closes.

551
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:46,159
Now that is a joke.

552
00:31:46,264 --> 00:31:47,825
It's... I'll see you tomorrow.

553
00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:51,960
Thanks, pal.

554
00:32:00,407 --> 00:32:02,294
I don't know.

555
00:32:04,983 --> 00:32:06,805
- I don't know what it is.
- Mmm.

556
00:32:06,903 --> 00:32:09,204
You pick her up
and she cries,

557
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,124
you put her down and she cries.

558
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:13,044
I don't know.

559
00:32:13,142 --> 00:32:15,029
I don't know why you just
don't hire a nanny.

560
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:17,068
Get Mary Poppins for Christ's sake.

561
00:32:17,173 --> 00:32:19,245
Did Brad put you up to this?

562
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:21,007
No.

563
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:22,450
I'm just saying you need a break.

564
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,883
Go... shopping, go out to dinner.

565
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:27,119
Go get a hotel room and take a nap.

566
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,042
Just get out of here
for a little while.

567
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,285
It'll do everybody some good.

568
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:33,323
I could never leave her
with anybody else.

569
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:35,762
Have you spoken to your shrink?

570
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,681
So sick of shrinks.

571
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:40,626
I've given them 17 years,
what have they given me?

572
00:32:40,723 --> 00:32:41,738
A migraine.

573
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:43,119
I'm just saying
you got to stay

574
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:44,364
on top of these things.

575
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:46,605
Speaking from personal experience.

576
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:49,641
I mean, I'm a little worried here.

577
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,448
Look at this.

578
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:56,685
Look at this, maybe I'm...

579
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:59,305
maybe I'm not providing for her.

580
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:01,613
Well, that's quite a device.

581
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,080
It looks like you're giving
oxygen to your tit.

582
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:07,080
Shut up.

583
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:08,394
Oh, I was kidding.

584
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:09,511
No, you shut up!

585
00:33:09,616 --> 00:33:11,110
Oh, please.

586
00:33:11,217 --> 00:33:13,039
I was kidding.

587
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:16,398
Look, it's not all that bad.

588
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,318
And it's... shh.

589
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:19,909
It's gonna get better.

590
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:21,422
This is the slog.

591
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,894
This is the slog, right?

592
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:25,293
Soon enough our little
Lily's gonna be adorable

593
00:33:25,391 --> 00:33:28,173
and all of this is
gonna be forgotten.

594
00:33:33,614 --> 00:33:35,501
See.

595
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:39,341
ABBY:
Oh, God, please.

596
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,531
Hi, honey.

597
00:33:43,629 --> 00:33:45,123
Joshua, my boy.

598
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:47,083
Can I go out for a bit, Mom?

599
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:50,628
- Sure.
- Off to bury the evidence, huh?

600
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:52,554
ABBY:
Where are you going?

601
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:54,342
I have some more toys for Goodwill.

602
00:33:54,444 --> 00:33:58,240
Okay, but just come home
right afterwards, yeah?

603
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:05,030
You let him walk the
streets by himself,

604
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:06,145
at nine years old?

605
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:07,428
Oh, come on.

606
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:09,669
I mean, does he seem like
your typical nine-year-old?

607
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:11,658
Yeah, I suppose not.

608
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:17,768
<i>Mrs., uh...</i>

609
00:34:17,865 --> 00:34:19,491
<i>Ms. Danforth.</i>

610
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:20,608
<i>Ms. Danforth, hi.</i>

611
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:21,793
<i>- Yes, hi.
- Hi.</i>

612
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:22,912
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

613
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:24,424
<i>Oh, no that's fine.</i>

614
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,536
<i>I, uh...</i>

615
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:27,365
got tied up.

616
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:28,806
Hey, which one's his desk?

617
00:34:28,905 --> 00:34:30,181
Oh, it's right here.

618
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:31,622
Front and center.

619
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,443
Oh, well, that's good,
eager beaver, huh?

620
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:36,548
Um... yeah.

621
00:34:36,648 --> 00:34:38,055
Oh, um,

622
00:34:38,152 --> 00:34:39,559
can I ask a question, Ms. Danforth?

623
00:34:39,656 --> 00:34:40,833
Yes, Mr. Cairn.

624
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:44,678
Joshua, he's, uh...

625
00:34:44,775 --> 00:34:46,117
How smart is he?

626
00:34:46,215 --> 00:34:48,670
Well, this might be getting
ahead of ourselves,

627
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:50,630
but we thinkJoshua
might benefit

628
00:34:50,727 --> 00:34:51,741
by skipping a grade,

629
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:53,505
maybe two.

630
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:55,428
Hmm.

631
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,348
Yeah, we're so different.

632
00:34:57,446 --> 00:34:59,268
Me and my son.

633
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:00,543
My son and I...

634
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:03,067
I- I-I, uh...

635
00:35:03,174 --> 00:35:05,061
You know, I'd probably
be the kid in the class

636
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:07,393
who picked on him
'cause he was different.

637
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:12,642
Hey, where are the
animals in the...?

638
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,358
Oh, a couple of weeks
ago, they all died.

639
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,242
It was a horrible day.

640
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:20,194
Oh, that is horrible.
What happened?

641
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:24,088
We think maybe there was
a fungus in the food pellets.

642
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:27,010
We've contacted the manufacturer.

643
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:30,587
In fact, we're using it as
an exercise in consumer rights.

644
00:36:58,394 --> 00:37:01,012
Clumsy, Abby.

645
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:04,277
Yeah, she's so clumsy
when she's tired.

646
00:37:20,152 --> 00:37:22,453
Mm-hmm.

647
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:23,632
You were right.

648
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:26,998
There are ghosts here.

649
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:32,310
Everywhere there are ghosts.

650
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:37,933
Um...

651
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:40,787
Joshua, um,

652
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:42,293
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

653
00:37:43,285 --> 00:37:44,333
I'm sorry.

654
00:37:44,438 --> 00:37:46,445
Come here.

655
00:37:49,205 --> 00:37:52,849
Oh.

656
00:37:56,597 --> 00:38:00,491
Oh... oh, God.

657
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:04,044
Poor, clumsy Abby.

658
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,579
Oh.

659
00:38:13,683 --> 00:38:15,112
Oh, I feel it.

660
00:38:15,218 --> 00:38:19,374
You know, and it
feels kind of prickly.

661
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:23,664
Hmm.

662
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:27,503
Oh... oh, yeah.

663
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:30,601
You know, I used to have
a pair of red boots.

664
00:38:32,081 --> 00:38:34,765
My God, they were so sexy.

665
00:38:57,999 --> 00:38:59,657
Hey.

666
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:01,733
Hey. How are you, sis?

667
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,497
I'm so glad you could come.

668
00:39:03,598 --> 00:39:05,485
15 stitches.

669
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:09,325
She's a trooper.

670
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:12,619
I can, I can stay.

671
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:13,797
No, no, no, go home.

672
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:15,330
Go home, we'll be fine.

673
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,997
We're good, get some sleep.

674
00:39:17,997 --> 00:39:19,939
I'll see you later.

675
00:39:55,689 --> 00:39:56,769
BRAD:
Hello?

676
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:03,358
Hey, hey, buddy.

677
00:40:03,464 --> 00:40:06,628
What you doing?

678
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:09,662
Huh?

679
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:11,589
Scoot over.

680
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:13,029
Is Mommy going to get better?

681
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:13,989
Yes, she will.

682
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:16,705
Look what I got.
I got you a book.

683
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:19,141
<i>Valley of the Kings.</i>

684
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,864
Pretty cool, huh?

685
00:40:22,182 --> 00:40:23,360
You like that?

686
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,120
Thank you so much.

687
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,360
You're welcome so much.

688
00:40:27,462 --> 00:40:29,349
You know, people
say the Met,

689
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:30,461
but the Brooklyn Museum's

690
00:40:30,565 --> 00:40:32,474
the place to go for Egyptian art.

691
00:40:32,581 --> 00:40:34,588
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

692
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:36,515
Your father's a wealth
of information.

693
00:40:36,613 --> 00:40:38,435
You didn't know that, did you?

694
00:40:38,533 --> 00:40:40,388
Maybe we'll go sometime.

695
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,162
Hey, there she is.

696
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,274
Hi, sweetie.

697
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,874
- How are ya?
- How're you doing?

698
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:48,157
I'm good.
You look tired.

699
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,437
Oh.

700
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:52,473
How are they doing?

701
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,986
Good and it's fine here.

702
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,512
Everything is quiet.

703
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,237
Lily settled down, Abby's in bed.

704
00:40:58,339 --> 00:40:59,833
You should take a nap, too.

705
00:40:59,939 --> 00:41:01,499
- Yeah.
- It's the weekend, for heaven sakes.

706
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:03,358
Go on and get some sleep.

707
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:04,734
I appreciate you
coming all this way.

708
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,721
Please, will you go have a rest?

709
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:08,378
Thanks, but I'm not tired.

710
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:11,897
- Look, I'm here so you can relax.
- Okay.

711
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:16,344
ABBY:
Hazel, I don't need another goddamn thing.

712
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:17,910
Hey, hey, hey, ooh.

713
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,904
Slow down. It's me.

714
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:23,255
How's your foot?

715
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,294
It's fine.

716
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,577
Are you pumping?

717
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,858
Yeah, I'm pumping.

718
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,454
You know,
if your saint of a mother's

719
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,382
going to be feeding
Lily at night,

720
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,302
she's going to need some milk.

721
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:36,341
Abby...

722
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,717
Don't take Lily away from me.

723
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:40,538
Of course not, of course
I'm not going to take her...

724
00:41:40,638 --> 00:41:43,005
She needs me, not some
dried up old sponge.

725
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:44,925
Abby, Abby, Abby.

726
00:41:45,023 --> 00:41:46,932
Sweetie.

727
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,111
Y- you...

728
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:51,832
Let's all try to get along,
you know what I mean?

729
00:41:51,934 --> 00:41:53,973
Come on.

730
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:55,637
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

731
00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:57,017
She's here to help.

732
00:41:57,117 --> 00:41:58,775
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

733
00:41:58,877 --> 00:42:00,764
I got your prescriptions.

734
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:08,055
This is for your foot,

735
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:10,807
and this is going to make you...

736
00:42:10,908 --> 00:42:12,468
feel better.

737
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,506
It'll help your, uh...

738
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:17,466
You know what I mean?

739
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:22,266
Can I breast-feed?

740
00:42:24,635 --> 00:42:25,976
No.

741
00:42:26,074 --> 00:42:28,627
No, sweetie,
but this is,

742
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,907
this is just a hurdle.

743
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,864
Abby, you know, once you get
over this hurdle,

744
00:42:31,961 --> 00:42:33,870
you can ease off the medication.

745
00:42:33,978 --> 00:42:35,188
You can start breast-feeding again.

746
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,428
It's just a few weeks,
maybe a month.

747
00:42:37,529 --> 00:42:39,416
That's all.

748
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:45,135
I'm going to take care
of everything, you know?

749
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:47,063
I'm going to take
care of the laundry.

750
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:48,437
I'm going to take care of Lily.

751
00:42:48,536 --> 00:42:50,194
Don't you worry.

752
00:42:50,296 --> 00:42:53,263
Okay?

753
00:42:53,368 --> 00:42:54,513
Mommy, Daddy?

754
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,622
Hey, sport.

755
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:58,385
I'm going to go and walk the dog.

756
00:42:58,487 --> 00:42:59,664
Okay, sport.

757
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:01,360
Just around the block.

758
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:03,634
- JOSHUA: Mommy, Daddy?
- Yeah?

759
00:43:03,735 --> 00:43:05,622
I love you.

760
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:16,305
When did you start
calling him "sport"?

761
00:43:48,434 --> 00:43:50,856
Hey.

762
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,849
- Tough week, huh?
- Yeah.

763
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,017
I think it's getting better.

764
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:57,990
I mean, Lily's slowly
figuring life out.

765
00:43:58,098 --> 00:43:59,374
And I think Abby's
starting to see

766
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:00,782
the light at the end of the tunnel.

767
00:44:00,881 --> 00:44:01,829
I don't know.

768
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:03,082
Excuse me?

769
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:06,251
I mean, all in all, I'm positive.

770
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,174
Oh, well, I am so relieved.

771
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:10,574
See I thought
we were losing money

772
00:44:10,672 --> 00:44:11,785
hand over fist.

773
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:13,546
I thought we were
on the verge

774
00:44:13,648 --> 00:44:16,495
of losing a year's gains
in the matter of a month.

775
00:44:16,591 --> 00:44:17,933
I thought we were fucked.

776
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:20,170
But as long
as everybody's happy

777
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:22,693
at home, then I just-
I feel so much better.

778
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:25,133
Okay, uh, I know it looks bad.

779
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,343
It is bad!

780
00:44:26,446 --> 00:44:28,421
Our long is looking short!

781
00:44:28,526 --> 00:44:29,900
Okay, okay.
But we've got to sit tight.

782
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:31,208
It's just a little sell-off

783
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,699
and then it'll be a big buyback.

784
00:44:33,806 --> 00:44:37,384
It's gonna work out, Chester.

785
00:44:37,486 --> 00:44:40,006
It's gonna get better.

786
00:44:45,388 --> 00:44:47,657
Hazel, you don't have to do that.

787
00:44:47,757 --> 00:44:49,447
Oh, I enjoy it.

788
00:44:49,548 --> 00:44:52,810
I'm having a grand old time.

789
00:44:52,908 --> 00:44:55,275
And where is Lily?

790
00:44:55,372 --> 00:44:57,739
- Napping.
- Oh.

791
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:34,817
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

792
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,058
Sorry.

793
00:45:43,303 --> 00:45:45,190
Yeah?

794
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:21,953
Where, where is he?

795
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:24,418
He's in the kitchen, sweetie.

796
00:46:38,146 --> 00:46:42,040
Oh, Buster.

797
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:44,798
Hey, pal.

798
00:46:48,512 --> 00:46:52,222
Oh, no.

799
00:47:06,303 --> 00:47:09,204
Oh, Buster.

800
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:15,256
Hey, pal.

801
00:47:17,182 --> 00:47:18,970
No!

802
00:47:29,021 --> 00:47:31,225
Well, what should we do for food?

803
00:47:31,325 --> 00:47:32,273
I- I don't know.

804
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,941
I'm not going into that kitchen.

805
00:47:34,044 --> 00:47:34,905
They'll be here soon.

806
00:47:35,004 --> 00:47:36,597
Did he eat anything in the park?

807
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:41,457
Joshua? Hey.

808
00:47:41,563 --> 00:47:43,985
Did-did he eat anything in the park?

809
00:47:44,091 --> 00:47:47,091
Anything peculiar at all?

810
00:47:47,195 --> 00:47:48,689
No.

811
00:47:48,795 --> 00:47:50,682
And then you took him right home?

812
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:53,434
Josh?

813
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,352
- Did you take him right home?
- Yeah.

814
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,671
Did you give him anything at all?

815
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,177
Did you give him anything?

816
00:48:01,273 --> 00:48:02,484
Brad, he was an old dog.

817
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:08,597
Every dog has its day, and
Buster had a shitty fucking day.

818
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:11,955
Join the club.

819
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:31,248
Wait, wait, wait.

820
00:48:33,846 --> 00:48:37,774
We should keep this.

821
00:49:06,324 --> 00:49:08,593
Brad?

822
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:09,935
Yeah, sweetie?

823
00:49:10,035 --> 00:49:12,107
You have to come home right now.

824
00:49:12,211 --> 00:49:14,283
They're coming through the ceiling.

825
00:49:16,306 --> 00:49:18,248
Hmm?

826
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,420
They're coming through the ceiling.

827
00:49:23,954 --> 00:49:26,059
Hi!

828
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:29,452
Hi, sweetie.

829
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:33,449
We have to hurry.

830
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,665
Okay.

831
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:42,735
W- where is it?
Is it in the bathroom?

832
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,552
I don't understand. Is it...

833
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:52,365
Uh... I'm sorry? Where?

834
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:01,325
Shit.

835
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:04,204
Uh-huh.

836
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,479
There's nothing?

837
00:50:05,582 --> 00:50:06,530
No, I mean, uh...

838
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:10,183
There's a crack up there,
but I mean,

839
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:11,529
that crack has been there forever.

840
00:50:11,629 --> 00:50:12,611
Is everything okay?

841
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:16,708
Because I've got to...

842
00:50:16,812 --> 00:50:20,489
I've got to be at Midtown...
for the...

843
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:22,082
What's going on?

844
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:25,603
Look at me.

845
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:26,951
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

846
00:50:27,052 --> 00:50:30,248
It's okay, but now I've got to go.

847
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:34,536
Sweetie.

848
00:50:34,635 --> 00:50:36,009
I'm so sorry.

849
00:50:36,107 --> 00:50:37,154
I'm sorry.

850
00:50:37,259 --> 00:50:38,241
I love our kids.

851
00:50:38,346 --> 00:50:40,550
I love our kids, too.

852
00:50:58,729 --> 00:51:01,957
Reach to Him, the hand
that is always there!

853
00:51:02,056 --> 00:51:03,911
The hand ofJesus.

854
00:51:04,008 --> 00:51:05,382
He is always there!

855
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,545
Reach to Him
and He will embrace you!

856
00:51:08,647 --> 00:51:10,305
He will prepare you.

857
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:13,756
He will arm you
with the sword of righteousness

858
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:17,791
so you will not have
to fight this battle alone!

859
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:34,720
We have big news.

860
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:36,129
Good news.

861
00:51:36,228 --> 00:51:37,089
What is it?

862
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:38,879
Joshua.

863
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,868
I want to get born again.

864
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:43,233
You what?

865
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:47,936
I tookJoshua to
a prayer meeting today

866
00:51:48,036 --> 00:51:49,890
and he was touched by the spirit.

867
00:51:49,987 --> 00:51:51,481
Weren't you, son?

868
00:51:51,587 --> 00:51:53,975
And he wants to get
right with Christ.

869
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:56,155
Well, too bad his mom
is a big, fatJew.

870
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:57,241
Mom.

871
00:51:57,346 --> 00:51:59,768
Well, his father is
a proud, strong Christian.

872
00:51:59,874 --> 00:52:01,368
And Joshua made this
decision for himself.

873
00:52:01,474 --> 00:52:02,849
Mom...

874
00:52:02,946 --> 00:52:05,019
- I'm-I'm sorry, but that's not happening.
- No.

875
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,780
Well, you said it was his decision.

876
00:52:06,882 --> 00:52:10,395
And he's old enough now
to make that decision.

877
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:11,904
Mom, I think we have some say.

878
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:14,073
Well, you said
that it was his decision.

879
00:52:14,177 --> 00:52:15,420
- ABBY: You fucking bitch.
- Mom.

880
00:52:15,521 --> 00:52:17,015
- Abby, Abby, Abby.
- No, no, no, no.

881
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:18,397
No! No!
No child of mine

882
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:20,536
is going to grow up to be
a goddamn Evangelical nutcase.

883
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,501
Okay, okay.

884
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,777
Okay, Abby.

885
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,440
No! You've been whispering
poison into his ears.

886
00:52:24,544 --> 00:52:26,332
You fucking narrow-minded
medieval scold.

887
00:52:26,432 --> 00:52:27,359
Abby! Abby!

888
00:52:27,456 --> 00:52:29,823
You know, Abby,
I feel sorry for you.

889
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,349
That motherhood is such a chore.

890
00:52:31,455 --> 00:52:32,316
You know what?

891
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,975
Get out of my house!

892
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,242
Okay, okay, let's-let's turn down
the volume a little bit here, okay?

893
00:52:37,343 --> 00:52:38,488
You know, maybe
you should try Christ

894
00:52:38,591 --> 00:52:39,670
instead of all those pills.

895
00:52:39,775 --> 00:52:41,116
You know what? Get out!

896
00:52:41,214 --> 00:52:42,872
Ow!

897
00:52:42,974 --> 00:52:47,164
Calm down, calm down.

898
00:52:48,414 --> 00:52:50,748
It's always a battle,Joshua.

899
00:52:50,846 --> 00:52:54,261
Just hold tight to your sword.

900
00:52:54,365 --> 00:52:57,180
BRAD:
Mom, I'm just saying he's young.

901
00:52:57,277 --> 00:53:00,538
He doesn't know, he doesn't know
what he wants yet, okay?

902
00:53:00,637 --> 00:53:02,491
And he's reading the...
the Bible!

903
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:04,497
And my-my-my wife,

904
00:53:04,604 --> 00:53:06,578
just as things are
starting to get good...

905
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,244
now I've got to medicate her...

906
00:53:08,348 --> 00:53:10,682
because... because
you crossed the line.

907
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,088
Now is not the time, Mom.

908
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:13,300
I- I need you here.

909
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:14,483
Wait a second.
Wait a sec.

910
00:53:14,588 --> 00:53:16,410
Wait one second, little man.

911
00:53:16,507 --> 00:53:18,929
Now I want you to listen.

912
00:53:19,035 --> 00:53:21,969
I have been quiet and nice
the last few weeks.

913
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,757
But now I have something to say.

914
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:27,541
This is no place for a family.

915
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:29,529
This is not a home.

916
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:30,902
This is my home.

917
00:53:31,002 --> 00:53:32,431
No, this is a house.

918
00:53:32,537 --> 00:53:35,701
It's an apartment.

919
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:37,776
It's not a home.

920
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:38,928
Okay.

921
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:42,262
All this shouting
and this rage and anger,

922
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:44,564
you know, that infects
a soul, Bradley.

923
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:46,868
You know that.

924
00:53:46,968 --> 00:53:49,205
Regardless of God.

925
00:53:49,303 --> 00:53:50,580
Okay, okay, okay.

926
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:52,173
So stop acting
like a boy,

927
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,971
and start acting like a man.

928
00:53:54,071 --> 00:53:58,293
And take care of your family!

929
00:53:58,391 --> 00:54:00,213
You leave New York.

930
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:01,685
You come home.

931
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:05,579
You've been playing
city long enough.

932
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:09,101
It's time to grow up, Bradley.

933
00:54:09,206 --> 00:54:12,108
Once and for all.

934
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,584
So, you loveJesus, huh?

935
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:25,841
Go to bed.

936
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,577
MAN:
Can you help me out, little man?

937
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:44,203
Just something.

938
00:54:44,307 --> 00:54:47,470
Anything.

939
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,425
I'm no chooser here.

940
00:54:55,185 --> 00:54:58,414
I'll give you five dollars
if I can throw a rock at you.

941
00:55:03,249 --> 00:55:04,296
NED:
Knock, knock.

942
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:07,919
Hello, hello, hello!

943
00:55:09,136 --> 00:55:10,379
Hazel, are
you ready

944
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,389
for your big night out on the town?

945
00:55:13,775 --> 00:55:15,597
Dinner atJoe Allen's
followed

946
00:55:15,695 --> 00:55:17,767
by the magic of...

947
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:19,332
<i>The Lion King.</i>

948
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:20,999
Oh, Ned.

949
00:55:21,102 --> 00:55:23,175
I can't wait. Uh...

950
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:27,140
Let me just, uh,
quickly fix my face.

951
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,313
<i>BRAD:
Honey, I can't...</i>

952
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,261
I can't get home right now, okay?

953
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:39,496
I'm expecting a thing of beauty.

954
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:42,182
Sleep tight.

955
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:44,357
Hi. You know I...
You know I told you

956
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,086
I need to nail this tomorrow, right?

957
00:55:46,189 --> 00:55:48,555
You know, I told you this
a million times, right?

958
00:55:48,652 --> 00:55:50,757
Joshua's fine, everyone's fine.

959
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,031
Okay, listen to me,
listen to me, listen, listen.

960
00:55:53,131 --> 00:55:54,244
Shh, shh, shh, listen, listen.

961
00:55:54,347 --> 00:55:56,486
Just be the wonderful mother
that you are, okay?

962
00:55:56,587 --> 00:55:58,278
And everything's going
to be just fine.

963
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,135
I got to go, okay?

964
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:02,853
Just... I got to go,
I got to go. I love you.

965
00:56:03,979 --> 00:56:05,288
Hey.

966
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:14,593
Mommy?

967
00:56:14,698 --> 00:56:16,967
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

968
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,270
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

969
00:56:42,247 --> 00:56:43,839
Ah, she finally fell asleep.

970
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:52,805
Are you okay, Mommy?

971
00:56:52,902 --> 00:56:54,811
Yeah, yeah.

972
00:56:54,917 --> 00:56:56,259
I just...

973
00:56:56,358 --> 00:56:57,634
Mommy's just being silly.

974
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:00,191
You know, hormones.

975
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:01,308
What moans?

976
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:04,510
N- Never mind.

977
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:07,869
So...

978
00:57:07,972 --> 00:57:10,972
Are we safe, Mommy?

979
00:57:11,076 --> 00:57:13,531
Well, what do you mean?

980
00:57:13,636 --> 00:57:16,025
Does Daddy love me?

981
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,466
Of course he loves you.

982
00:57:18,563 --> 00:57:20,537
Yes, he loves you very, very much.

983
00:57:20,643 --> 00:57:22,465
Yeah.

984
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:23,839
But not like a mommy.

985
00:57:42,273 --> 00:57:43,549
Can we play together?

986
00:57:45,057 --> 00:57:47,326
Yeah. Yeah, let's play a game, huh?

987
00:57:47,424 --> 00:57:49,399
What do you want to
play, backgammon?

988
00:57:49,504 --> 00:57:50,813
Hide-and-seek.

989
00:57:50,912 --> 00:57:52,374
Hide-and-seek?

990
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,480
Oh. Well, I...

991
00:57:55,584 --> 00:57:57,624
Okay, fine.

992
00:57:57,727 --> 00:57:59,483
Good. I'll hide, you seek.

993
00:57:59,584 --> 00:58:01,372
Yeah, I figured as much.

994
00:58:01,471 --> 00:58:04,122
You close your eyes and count to 50.

995
00:58:04,223 --> 00:58:05,368
Okay.

996
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:06,998
And Mommy?

997
00:58:07,103 --> 00:58:08,958
Yeah?

998
00:58:09,054 --> 00:58:11,291
No peeking.

999
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:12,797
Okay.

1000
00:58:15,134 --> 00:58:17,817
One, two, three,

1001
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:19,773
four, five,

1002
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:22,138
six, seven,

1003
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:24,986
eight, nine, ten,

1004
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:27,027
<i>11, 12,</i>

1005
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:28,955
13,

1006
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:31,419
<i>14, 15...</i>

1007
00:58:38,907 --> 00:58:41,176
<i>45, 46,</i>

1008
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:44,144
<i>47, 48,</i>

1009
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:48,211
<i>49...</i>

1010
00:58:48,315 --> 00:58:50,257
50!

1011
00:58:50,362 --> 00:58:52,729
Ready or not, here I come.

1012
00:59:00,825 --> 00:59:02,897
I'm going to get you.

1013
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:07,630
Are you here?

1014
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,507
Where are you?

1015
00:59:25,783 --> 00:59:28,914
Where are you?!

1016
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,579
Huh?

1017
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:41,739
Where are you?

1018
01:00:05,651 --> 01:00:07,560
Joshua!

1019
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:34,318
You know how to get a-a
Polish guy out of a tree?

1020
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:38,764
A one-armed Polish
guy out of a tree.

1021
01:00:38,864 --> 01:00:40,009
I- I already messed it up.

1022
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:42,824
You wave to him.

1023
01:00:42,927 --> 01:00:44,137
That's a...
little ditty I...

1024
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,531
Hello. What's up?

1025
01:00:49,391 --> 01:00:51,081
What?

1026
01:00:51,183 --> 01:00:52,808
Joshua!

1027
01:00:52,911 --> 01:00:54,820
Where are you?!

1028
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,044
Oh.

1029
01:02:31,813 --> 01:02:33,984
Honey?

1030
01:02:40,036 --> 01:02:41,923
Lily?

1031
01:02:49,347 --> 01:02:51,419
Lily?!

1032
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:07,069
Oh, Christ.

1033
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,018
Abby, you in here?

1034
01:03:25,663 --> 01:03:27,932
Sweetie?

1035
01:03:32,895 --> 01:03:34,782
Abby?

1036
01:03:37,374 --> 01:03:38,781
Sweetie?

1037
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:42,301
Oh, baby.

1038
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,899
Oh, sweetie.

1039
01:03:47,006 --> 01:03:49,689
It's okay.

1040
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:51,000
It's okay.

1041
01:03:51,101 --> 01:03:52,694
Everything's fine.

1042
01:03:52,797 --> 01:03:55,447
You're going to be okay, sweetie.

1043
01:03:56,445 --> 01:03:58,419
You're going to be okay.

1044
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,685
Everything's going to be okay.

1045
01:04:01,788 --> 01:04:03,675
You're okay.

1046
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,289
You're my angel.

1047
01:04:07,387 --> 01:04:10,354
You're my little angel.

1048
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:13,459
Hey, kiddo, you okay?

1049
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:15,701
Shh!

1050
01:04:15,803 --> 01:04:17,559
It's okay, sweetie.

1051
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:19,065
It's okay.

1052
01:04:20,698 --> 01:04:21,778
It's okay.

1053
01:04:21,882 --> 01:04:23,769
Did you get hurt?

1054
01:04:27,258 --> 01:04:29,080
Are you hurt?

1055
01:04:29,177 --> 01:04:31,544
Lily's fine.
See, look.

1056
01:04:31,641 --> 01:04:32,851
She's asleep in her crib.

1057
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:35,287
She's fine. See?

1058
01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:38,035
- Okay?
- You!

1059
01:04:38,137 --> 01:04:39,151
Sweetie, sweetie.

1060
01:04:39,257 --> 01:04:40,751
You!

1061
01:04:40,856 --> 01:04:42,896
Did you even look for me, Mommy?

1062
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,422
- You!
- Abby! Abby! Abby!

1063
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,796
Abby!

1064
01:04:53,751 --> 01:04:55,639
Abby, come here.

1065
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,713
BRAD:
Ah! You scratched me!

1066
01:05:38,387 --> 01:05:39,947
NED:
Sorry I-

1067
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:42,505
I didn't go inside.
It's the smell.

1068
01:05:42,611 --> 01:05:45,000
- BRAD: Yeah.
- You know, it brings up...

1069
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:47,113
unpleasant memories.

1070
01:05:47,218 --> 01:05:49,738
- You got a light?
- Yeah.

1071
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:54,056
How is she?

1072
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:56,332
She's pretty heavily medicated.

1073
01:05:56,433 --> 01:05:58,320
Good.

1074
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:03,435
The doctor said she hasn't
been taking her medication,

1075
01:06:03,536 --> 01:06:06,602
but I... I-I-I made sure every day.

1076
01:06:06,704 --> 01:06:08,646
- I mean, I thought I was on top of that.
- Yeah.

1077
01:06:08,752 --> 01:06:10,475
- You know?
- We Davidoffs are crafty.

1078
01:06:10,576 --> 01:06:13,892
She's probably cheeking the dose.

1079
01:06:13,999 --> 01:06:15,657
Why, why? Why would she do that?

1080
01:06:15,759 --> 01:06:17,962
It's the eternal question.

1081
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:24,932
I've been playing
spot the loony,

1082
01:06:25,038 --> 01:06:26,926
but it's hard to tell.

1083
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:31,245
She was really...

1084
01:06:35,437 --> 01:06:36,779
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

1085
01:06:36,877 --> 01:06:39,778
Oh, what are you sorry about?

1086
01:06:39,885 --> 01:06:41,346
I feel like I let her down, dude.

1087
01:06:41,453 --> 01:06:44,235
Oh, come on, man.
This runs in the family.

1088
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,267
She'll get better, she will.

1089
01:06:47,372 --> 01:06:48,714
It's-you've got to be optimistic.

1090
01:06:48,812 --> 01:06:51,495
They've made great
strides in psychotropics.

1091
01:07:01,738 --> 01:07:03,593
You sure you want to do this?

1092
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:06,952
Oh, Chester, I don't
think I have a choice.

1093
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,959
You know, a lot of people
find comfort in work

1094
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,626
when things are tough at home.

1095
01:07:10,729 --> 01:07:12,704
You give up on work,

1096
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:14,533
you might find yourself
with nothing, chief.

1097
01:07:14,633 --> 01:07:16,389
I'm just taking a vacation.

1098
01:07:16,489 --> 01:07:18,463
Is that what you're calling it?

1099
01:07:18,569 --> 01:07:20,740
Yeah, two weeks vacation.

1100
01:07:20,841 --> 01:07:22,150
I've got personal days, too.

1101
01:07:22,248 --> 01:07:24,070
This is not the time for a vacation.

1102
01:07:24,168 --> 01:07:25,662
- I'll be checking in.
- Buddy.

1103
01:07:25,769 --> 01:07:27,524
Wait, are you my friend?

1104
01:07:27,624 --> 01:07:28,704
Are we really buddies?

1105
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:30,718
Because if we are,
then you'll understand.

1106
01:07:30,824 --> 01:07:32,231
If we're not, that's fine.

1107
01:07:32,328 --> 01:07:33,669
But you're gonna have to fire me.

1108
01:07:33,767 --> 01:07:35,327
- Whoa, there.
- Hey, hey.

1109
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:37,154
I can't- Do you love your kids?

1110
01:07:37,255 --> 01:07:39,077
Yeah, of course.

1111
01:07:39,175 --> 01:07:40,636
I- I have to be home right now.

1112
01:07:40,743 --> 01:07:44,997
Okay? Cover for me or don't.

1113
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,603
Hello?

1114
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:11,392
Mom? Joshua?

1115
01:08:12,484 --> 01:08:14,371
Anybody here?

1116
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,778
What're you looking at?

1117
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,116
Seth.

1118
01:08:53,216 --> 01:08:54,460
He's the god of chaos.

1119
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,698
Seth?

1120
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,622
That's the name of the god of chaos?

1121
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,086
Pity those heathens.

1122
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,337
<i>Seth cut Osirus into 14 pieces.</i>

1123
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,064
Bad Seth.

1124
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:09,654
But Seth is also good.

1125
01:09:09,758 --> 01:09:11,645
Without Seth, there is no order

1126
01:09:11,742 --> 01:09:12,887
because Seth is the only one

1127
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:14,997
who can battle
the evil serpent, Apep.

1128
01:09:15,102 --> 01:09:17,884
- Huh.
- Apep is all bad.

1129
01:09:17,982 --> 01:09:19,323
Pure darkness.

1130
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,330
He eats his own screams.

1131
01:09:21,437 --> 01:09:23,892
That's his only nourishment.

1132
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:25,819
Enough of this myth.

1133
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:29,495
If Apep swallowed you,
you become nothing.

1134
01:09:29,597 --> 01:09:31,091
A nonbeing.

1135
01:09:31,196 --> 01:09:34,065
Till the end of existence,
you'd remain in Apep's guts,

1136
01:09:34,172 --> 01:09:36,888
slowly digested for all of eternity.

1137
01:09:36,987 --> 01:09:38,710
And nobody would care
'cause nobody would

1138
01:09:38,811 --> 01:09:40,371
realize you were missing.

1139
01:09:42,843 --> 01:09:46,006
And then came Moses
to stop all this nonsense.

1140
01:10:08,664 --> 01:10:09,908
HAZEL:
Practice carrying...

1141
01:10:10,009 --> 01:10:12,823
You'll grow into it, honey,
we all do.

1142
01:11:34,928 --> 01:11:36,717
BRAD:
Nothing. She just started crying.

1143
01:11:36,816 --> 01:11:37,961
ABBY:
What did you do?

1144
01:11:38,064 --> 01:11:39,406
BRAD:
I didn't do anything.

1145
01:11:48,623 --> 01:11:49,637
Hi.

1146
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:51,204
How you doing?

1147
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:53,165
Going to the Brooklyn Museum of Art.

1148
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:55,051
Let's go, let's go.

1149
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:11,558
You know what, sweetie,

1150
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,213
I really need to use
this little girls' room

1151
01:12:14,316 --> 01:12:16,487
right here for a sec, all right?

1152
01:12:16,588 --> 01:12:19,370
You stay right here with the, uh...

1153
01:12:39,594 --> 01:12:41,699
Uh...

1154
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,977
What the fuck...

1155
01:13:18,854 --> 01:13:20,064
HAZEL:
Joshua!

1156
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,125
Joshua!

1157
01:13:34,629 --> 01:13:35,643
Joshua!

1158
01:13:40,228 --> 01:13:41,537
What were you doing?!

1159
01:13:41,636 --> 01:13:43,490
- Where were you?
- Where were you?!

1160
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:52,448
Brad.

1161
01:13:56,803 --> 01:13:59,323
So sorry. My God, Bradley.

1162
01:13:59,426 --> 01:14:00,473
Jesus Christ, Mom.

1163
01:14:00,578 --> 01:14:03,676
I'm so sorry.

1164
01:14:03,778 --> 01:14:05,534
Bradley.

1165
01:14:05,634 --> 01:14:07,608
I'm sorry.

1166
01:14:07,713 --> 01:14:09,818
I'm so sorry.

1167
01:14:16,865 --> 01:14:18,774
You gave me such a fright.

1168
01:14:21,536 --> 01:14:23,390
Shh, shh, shh.

1169
01:14:23,488 --> 01:14:25,560
HAZEL:
Don't! No! No! Oh! You...

1170
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:36,286
Nana!

1171
01:14:40,062 --> 01:14:42,004
No!

1172
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:43,965
WOMAN:
Does somebody have a cell phone?

1173
01:14:44,061 --> 01:14:45,174
I don't know...

1174
01:14:49,309 --> 01:14:51,251
I'm just so sorry about your mother.

1175
01:14:51,357 --> 01:14:53,048
I... those stairs.

1176
01:14:53,148 --> 01:14:55,003
They were just
an accident waiting to happen.

1177
01:14:55,101 --> 01:14:58,745
Yeah. I don't know
what happened, you know?

1178
01:14:58,845 --> 01:15:02,106
She was up there

1179
01:15:02,204 --> 01:15:03,633
with Josh...

1180
01:15:06,172 --> 01:15:07,416
Yeah.

1181
01:15:11,611 --> 01:15:14,131
You know, they say she slipped.

1182
01:15:16,602 --> 01:15:17,911
No doubt about it.

1183
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:20,661
You have had one fucked-up month.

1184
01:15:20,762 --> 01:15:22,999
I think he pushed her.

1185
01:15:23,098 --> 01:15:24,145
Who?

1186
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,908
Joshua.

1187
01:15:28,346 --> 01:15:30,582
Come on. That's...

1188
01:15:33,497 --> 01:15:35,766
Come on. You're...

1189
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:39,541
You're talking
about a nine-year-old boy.

1190
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,647
I think all of this
has been his doing.

1191
01:15:41,752 --> 01:15:43,694
Do you hear me?
I think Abby...

1192
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,582
I think the screaming-
Lily's screaming...

1193
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,719
There must be something we can do.

1194
01:15:48,823 --> 01:15:50,033
You don't understand.
I'm trying...

1195
01:15:50,135 --> 01:15:55,317
Maybe you should think
about talking to someone.

1196
01:15:55,415 --> 01:15:56,941
What are you talking about?

1197
01:15:57,047 --> 01:15:58,770
You mean like a shrink or something?

1198
01:15:58,871 --> 01:16:00,081
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1199
01:16:00,183 --> 01:16:02,386
I know if you...

1200
01:16:02,486 --> 01:16:04,875
This isn't about me.
I'm talking about...

1201
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:07,284
Ah!Joshua, my boy.

1202
01:16:34,579 --> 01:16:36,651
Lily's sleeping with me from now on.

1203
01:16:36,755 --> 01:16:39,210
Daddy?

1204
01:16:39,314 --> 01:16:40,776
Yes?

1205
01:16:40,882 --> 01:16:42,671
I'm scared.

1206
01:16:42,771 --> 01:16:45,356
Yeah? Well...

1207
01:16:46,898 --> 01:16:49,199
Daddy?

1208
01:16:49,297 --> 01:16:50,988
Yeah?

1209
01:16:51,089 --> 01:16:52,518
I don't understand.

1210
01:16:52,626 --> 01:16:53,869
Go to bed.

1211
01:17:26,638 --> 01:17:29,059
Daddy?

1212
01:17:29,165 --> 01:17:30,856
Do you like my house?

1213
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:32,746
I made it last night.

1214
01:17:45,069 --> 01:17:47,337
I know what you're doing,Josh.

1215
01:17:47,436 --> 01:17:49,825
<i>I don't know why you're
doing it, but I'm on to you.</i>

1216
01:17:51,884 --> 01:17:54,633
They're just blocks, Daddy.

1217
01:17:54,731 --> 01:17:58,887
You're not going
to hurt anybody else.

1218
01:18:00,555 --> 01:18:01,961
Are you mad at me?

1219
01:18:02,058 --> 01:18:06,019
Do you still love me, Daddy?

1220
01:18:09,802 --> 01:18:11,874
I think you're sick,Josh.

1221
01:18:18,089 --> 01:18:20,260
I don't feel sick.

1222
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:22,051
Not at all.

1223
01:18:26,024 --> 01:18:29,406
Why are you doing this?

1224
01:18:29,512 --> 01:18:32,032
Huh?

1225
01:18:37,063 --> 01:18:39,746
You know what
the best part is, Daddy?

1226
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,441
Hi. How are you?

1227
01:20:40,539 --> 01:20:42,000
Good to see you.

1228
01:20:42,107 --> 01:20:43,513
Really good to see you.

1229
01:21:02,393 --> 01:21:07,127
Hey, buddy, this is Dr. Polsheck.

1230
01:21:07,224 --> 01:21:08,817
She's here to talk to you.

1231
01:21:08,921 --> 01:21:10,197
Oh, no. Betsy, please.

1232
01:21:10,296 --> 01:21:12,946
Hello,Joshua.

1233
01:21:13,048 --> 01:21:16,048
Betsy's a child psychologist.

1234
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:18,006
She's going to talk to you.

1235
01:21:18,104 --> 01:21:20,918
Yeah. Maybe you could
show me your room. I hear

1236
01:21:21,015 --> 01:21:23,470
you have a guinea pig.
I love guinea pigs.

1237
01:21:23,574 --> 01:21:26,062
My guinea pig?

1238
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:29,515
Okay.

1239
01:21:29,622 --> 01:21:31,378
Great.

1240
01:21:31,478 --> 01:21:33,899
Have fun, buddy.

1241
01:21:34,006 --> 01:21:35,631
Do you like to draw?

1242
01:21:35,734 --> 01:21:37,195
Oh, I love drawing.

1243
01:21:59,731 --> 01:22:03,441
Keep drawing.
That's good.

1244
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:15,056
That's really something.

1245
01:22:23,089 --> 01:22:26,885
Joshua, come here for a second.

1246
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:28,781
Why don't you do me a favor,

1247
01:22:28,881 --> 01:22:31,182
and go in your bedroom? All right?

1248
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,654
Just for a second?

1249
01:22:37,168 --> 01:22:40,201
Listen, I should be alone
with the boy, okay?

1250
01:22:40,304 --> 01:22:42,442
Yeah. Sure.

1251
01:22:42,543 --> 01:22:44,931
Do you see...? This...

1252
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:46,981
this is off.
Something is wrong here.

1253
01:22:47,086 --> 01:22:48,842
This has got to be the sign
of some kind of...

1254
01:22:48,943 --> 01:22:50,699
- You got that right.
- Sociopath?

1255
01:22:50,798 --> 01:22:52,937
No, no, no, Mr. Cairn.

1256
01:22:53,038 --> 01:22:54,249
That's...
that's not it.

1257
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:56,554
What is this?

1258
01:22:56,654 --> 01:23:00,199
This picture is
a textbook example of abuse.

1259
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:02,636
Okay? That boy is being abused...

1260
01:23:02,733 --> 01:23:04,108
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1261
01:23:04,205 --> 01:23:05,929
to such a degree that I can't...

1262
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:07,239
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1263
01:23:07,341 --> 01:23:09,032
Let me tell you what
you're dealing with here.

1264
01:23:09,132 --> 01:23:10,026
- I don't care...
- He probably...

1265
01:23:10,124 --> 01:23:11,334
He probably researched it.

1266
01:23:11,437 --> 01:23:12,898
He probably looked it up
on the computer.

1267
01:23:13,004 --> 01:23:14,313
He probably knew exactly
what to draw.

1268
01:23:14,412 --> 01:23:16,452
This is abuse
I'm talking about right here.

1269
01:23:16,556 --> 01:23:17,962
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1270
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:20,710
What are you...?
Nobody's beating him.

1271
01:23:20,811 --> 01:23:21,989
I'm not... He probably...

1272
01:23:22,092 --> 01:23:23,269
Why are you being so defensive?

1273
01:23:23,371 --> 01:23:25,029
- I'm not being...
- I'm just pointing out the fact

1274
01:23:25,131 --> 01:23:27,334
- that your son has been abused.
- Listen, you have to...

1275
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:29,540
Back off!. Okay?

1276
01:23:45,034 --> 01:23:46,975
Talked to your headmaster.

1277
01:23:47,081 --> 01:23:48,193
- You did?
- Yeah.

1278
01:23:48,297 --> 01:23:50,119
We agreed you're not
being challenged enough,

1279
01:23:50,217 --> 01:23:53,512
so we're going to send you
somewhere else far away.

1280
01:23:53,608 --> 01:23:55,299
You're going to learn how to ski.

1281
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,050
It's going to be great.

1282
01:23:58,152 --> 01:23:59,046
But how could...?

1283
01:23:59,143 --> 01:24:00,452
End of discussion, little man.

1284
01:24:00,551 --> 01:24:02,493
No buts, okay?

1285
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,810
You're going away.

1286
01:24:03,911 --> 01:24:05,220
You understand?

1287
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:06,563
Hey.

1288
01:24:06,663 --> 01:24:07,972
Josh... Joshua!

1289
01:24:12,294 --> 01:24:13,222
What?

1290
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:15,107
What are you looking at?

1291
01:24:28,836 --> 01:24:30,592
Josh?

1292
01:24:32,357 --> 01:24:35,204
Josh, I want you to come here
right now, you hear me?

1293
01:24:37,636 --> 01:24:39,359
Josh.

1294
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,434
Hey, boy.

1295
01:24:44,611 --> 01:24:47,229
It's me. I want to talk to you.

1296
01:24:47,331 --> 01:24:49,305
We're going to talk about this.

1297
01:24:52,419 --> 01:24:53,979
Josh?

1298
01:24:55,842 --> 01:24:57,500
Joshua?

1299
01:24:58,434 --> 01:25:00,289
Josh!

1300
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:02,807
Everything's okay, buddy.
Come on out.

1301
01:25:02,914 --> 01:25:04,342
I know you're here.

1302
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:07,384
Listen, nothing's
set in stone, okay?

1303
01:25:08,897 --> 01:25:10,141
All right, suit yourself.

1304
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:12,958
Josh?

1305
01:25:13,056 --> 01:25:14,649
Josh!

1306
01:26:54,839 --> 01:26:56,781
Joshua.

1307
01:26:57,815 --> 01:26:59,473
Joshua.
What are you doing?

1308
01:26:59,574 --> 01:27:00,719
Come out from under there.

1309
01:27:00,822 --> 01:27:02,131
I don't want to go.

1310
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:03,178
Joshua, come on.

1311
01:27:03,285 --> 01:27:04,267
Come out from under there.

1312
01:27:05,494 --> 01:27:07,501
- I want to stay here
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1313
01:27:07,605 --> 01:27:10,093
- with you and Lily...
- Shh, shh, shh.

1314
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:13,263
- and Mom when she gets better.
- Shh, shh.

1315
01:27:13,365 --> 01:27:14,445
- Come here.
- I want to stay.

1316
01:27:14,548 --> 01:27:15,792
- Come on.
- Ow!

1317
01:27:15,893 --> 01:27:17,551
Ow!

1318
01:27:18,516 --> 01:27:19,945
Come here.

1319
01:27:20,053 --> 01:27:21,875
What's going on?

1320
01:27:21,972 --> 01:27:23,379
Ah, oh.

1321
01:27:23,476 --> 01:27:25,745
My God,Joshua,
what happened to you?

1322
01:27:25,844 --> 01:27:27,305
- What happened?
- I slipped.

1323
01:27:27,412 --> 01:27:28,339
You what?

1324
01:27:28,436 --> 01:27:30,126
I slipped.

1325
01:27:30,227 --> 01:27:32,169
- I-I...
- Joshua, please tell me what happened.

1326
01:27:32,275 --> 01:27:33,836
- I slipped, really.
- Who did this to you?

1327
01:27:33,939 --> 01:27:35,597
- I slipped, really.
- Who did this to you?!

1328
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:38,513
- I slipped.
- You tell me who did it to you.

1329
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:42,472
Look, it's just there, okay?
That's all.

1330
01:27:42,578 --> 01:27:44,782
It doesn't hurt much.

1331
01:27:44,882 --> 01:27:47,696
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1332
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:52,108
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, okay?

1333
01:28:07,472 --> 01:28:09,097
- Stay, stay with me.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1334
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,022
- Stay.
- Josh.

1335
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,646
- I got to go check...
- Stay.

1336
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:14,027
I got to check on Lily.

1337
01:28:14,127 --> 01:28:15,949
- Stay with me.
- I got to go.

1338
01:28:16,047 --> 01:28:17,388
Stay like you used to.

1339
01:28:17,487 --> 01:28:18,981
You're gonna...

1340
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:21,836
Stay with me like you used to.

1341
01:28:25,229 --> 01:28:27,880
Okay, okay, okay, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1342
01:28:27,982 --> 01:28:29,891
Just go to sleep.
Just go to sleep.

1343
01:28:33,389 --> 01:28:35,145
Just go to sleep, buddy.

1344
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,881
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1345
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,081
Josh? Josh.

1346
01:29:17,064 --> 01:29:19,911
Shh. She's almost done.

1347
01:29:21,256 --> 01:29:24,103
You were hungry this
morning, weren't you?

1348
01:29:27,496 --> 01:29:29,121
It's a beautiful day.

1349
01:29:29,224 --> 01:29:32,671
After this, how about
we go outside and play?

1350
01:29:57,957 --> 01:29:59,451
Joshua...

1351
01:30:01,828 --> 01:30:04,381
Beware of theJabberwock.

1352
01:30:04,484 --> 01:30:07,102
What?

1353
01:30:09,892 --> 01:30:11,680
Shh...

1354
01:30:11,779 --> 01:30:13,983
shh, shh, shh, shh.

1355
01:30:18,915 --> 01:30:20,376
Did he just...

1356
01:30:20,482 --> 01:30:22,587
just take your fuckin' binky?!

1357
01:30:25,506 --> 01:30:26,684
Joshua.

1358
01:30:26,786 --> 01:30:28,029
Joshua.

1359
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,788
Joshua!

1360
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,483
Where's Lily's binky?

1361
01:30:31,585 --> 01:30:33,211
Joshua!

1362
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:37,181
Joshua, come down.

1363
01:30:39,489 --> 01:30:40,666
Josh.

1364
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:41,717
Josh.

1365
01:30:46,464 --> 01:30:49,050
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1366
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:50,614
It's okay, it's okay.

1367
01:30:52,415 --> 01:30:53,364
Come on.

1368
01:30:53,471 --> 01:30:54,365
Let's go.

1369
01:30:54,464 --> 01:30:55,707
Come on, let's go.

1370
01:30:55,807 --> 01:30:58,011
I'm talking to you.
You better come down here right now.

1371
01:30:58,111 --> 01:30:59,933
- You better come down here right now.
- Joshua.

1372
01:31:02,271 --> 01:31:04,059
- Joshua.
- Joshua.

1373
01:31:07,294 --> 01:31:09,083
- Joshua...
- Joshua.

1374
01:31:09,182 --> 01:31:10,872
I'm not fucking around
with you right now,

1375
01:31:10,974 --> 01:31:11,901
you understand me?

1376
01:31:16,029 --> 01:31:16,891
Come down right now.

1377
01:31:16,989 --> 01:31:18,037
Come down right now.

1378
01:31:18,141 --> 01:31:19,515
Goddamn it!

1379
01:31:20,861 --> 01:31:22,355
- WOMAN: Bobby, get down from...
- Where is it?

1380
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:23,670
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1381
01:31:23,772 --> 01:31:25,048
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1382
01:31:25,148 --> 01:31:26,075
Where's Lily's binky?

1383
01:31:26,172 --> 01:31:27,066
Where's Lily's binky?

1384
01:31:27,164 --> 01:31:28,244
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1385
01:31:28,348 --> 01:31:29,395
You answer me.

1386
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,961
- You answer your father.
- You answer your father.

1387
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:32,016
Answer your father!

1388
01:31:32,124 --> 01:31:33,268
No, no, no, Daddy!

1389
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:40,660
Josh.

1390
01:31:40,763 --> 01:31:42,966
I'm sorry.

1391
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:50,548
Nobody will ever love you.

1392
01:32:46,548 --> 01:32:49,864
Oh, Chester, thank God.

1393
01:32:49,972 --> 01:32:51,346
- Hey, buddy.
- Sit down, sit down.

1394
01:32:51,444 --> 01:32:52,338
What's going on here?

1395
01:32:52,435 --> 01:32:53,897
When am I getting bail?

1396
01:32:54,003 --> 01:32:55,377
Not till Monday.

1397
01:32:55,475 --> 01:32:56,588
Don't you know?

1398
01:32:56,691 --> 01:32:58,666
Never beat up your kid
in public on the weekend.

1399
01:32:58,771 --> 01:33:00,178
Chester, um, I-I appreciate
you coming.

1400
01:33:00,275 --> 01:33:01,584
- All right.
- I've had a long...

1401
01:33:01,683 --> 01:33:04,432
Whatever!
Whatever! I'm here!

1402
01:33:04,531 --> 01:33:06,570
You see the judge tomorrow.

1403
01:33:09,138 --> 01:33:11,985
I've been doing
a little snooping via a friend.

1404
01:33:12,082 --> 01:33:13,195
This is bad.

1405
01:33:13,298 --> 01:33:14,159
This is really bad.

1406
01:33:14,258 --> 01:33:15,338
Yeah, I know it's bad, okay?

1407
01:33:15,441 --> 01:33:16,489
It isn't the whole story, Chester.

1408
01:33:16,593 --> 01:33:17,454
We'll, let's see.

1409
01:33:17,553 --> 01:33:19,113
- It's not...
- Let's see.

1410
01:33:19,217 --> 01:33:21,104
Uh, over 30 eyewitnesses,

1411
01:33:21,201 --> 01:33:23,208
your boy tells the cops
he's been being abused

1412
01:33:23,313 --> 01:33:24,938
since his sister was born,

1413
01:33:25,041 --> 01:33:26,502
bruises all over his body,

1414
01:33:26,608 --> 01:33:28,430
a sheaf ofJoshua's
drawings

1415
01:33:28,528 --> 01:33:29,837
that have the
authorities drooling...

1416
01:33:29,936 --> 01:33:33,896
Chester, goddamn it,
it isn't the whole story, okay?

1417
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,178
- Look...
- I'm trying to tell...

1418
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:36,872
I have to get out of here now.

1419
01:33:36,976 --> 01:33:41,677
They say you were tampering
with Abby's medication.

1420
01:33:41,775 --> 01:33:45,965
What? That's-that's insane.

1421
01:33:53,838 --> 01:33:55,626
No, look,
I don't care

1422
01:33:55,726 --> 01:33:56,871
if she's from
the Philippines

1423
01:33:56,974 --> 01:33:58,250
or Philadelphia,
I just need

1424
01:33:58,350 --> 01:34:01,895
someone who knows how
to take care of a baby.

1425
01:34:01,997 --> 01:34:03,972
Listen, if it looks like
it's for a kid,

1426
01:34:04,076 --> 01:34:05,898
pick it up and pack it,
okay? Thanks.

1427
01:34:07,789 --> 01:34:10,636
Oh, for the love of God,
please, today.

1428
01:34:10,732 --> 01:34:13,699
Yes, yes.

1429
01:34:13,804 --> 01:34:15,331
Imelda sounds great.

1430
01:34:15,436 --> 01:34:16,581
Yes.

1431
01:34:16,684 --> 01:34:20,939
Great, send her over.
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

1432
01:34:21,035 --> 01:34:22,344
Bye.

1433
01:34:24,651 --> 01:34:26,473
Hey...

1434
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:27,879
Imelda...

1435
01:34:27,978 --> 01:34:31,327
sounds like she is one
fabulous cook,

1436
01:34:31,434 --> 01:34:35,689
which makes you one
very, very lucky girl.

1437
01:34:35,786 --> 01:34:38,688
Want to suck on your hand instead?

1438
01:34:38,793 --> 01:34:43,365
Oh! Your sister's just about the
cutest thing in the whole world.

1439
01:34:44,489 --> 01:34:46,856
I love her more than anything.

1440
01:34:53,224 --> 01:34:56,802
You know, siblings
are very important

1441
01:34:56,904 --> 01:34:59,718
in strange times.

1442
01:34:59,815 --> 01:35:02,368
Speaking from experience.

1443
01:35:02,472 --> 01:35:04,544
Like you and Mom?

1444
01:35:04,647 --> 01:35:07,233
Yeah.

1445
01:35:08,294 --> 01:35:09,821
- Ned?
- Mm-hmm?

1446
01:35:09,926 --> 01:35:12,577
I'm glad you're here.

1447
01:35:12,679 --> 01:35:14,402
I mean...

1448
01:35:14,502 --> 01:35:17,349
you, me, th...

1449
01:35:17,446 --> 01:35:19,714
this feels right, doesn't it?

1450
01:35:19,813 --> 01:35:21,602
The way it always should have been.

1451
01:35:25,861 --> 01:35:29,177
We should compose
something together.

1452
01:35:36,388 --> 01:35:42,235
# Nobody ever
called me "Daddy" #

1453
01:35:42,339 --> 01:35:44,989
# Actually, that's not true. #

1454
01:35:45,091 --> 01:35:47,066
Ugh!

1455
01:35:59,298 --> 01:36:02,745
# You know they
didn't ever #

1456
01:36:02,849 --> 01:36:07,071
# Have to love me #

1457
01:36:07,169 --> 01:36:11,129
# No, no, no #

1458
01:36:11,233 --> 01:36:16,949
# And no one will ever
love them now #

1459
01:36:21,984 --> 01:36:25,758
# But they always
wanted somehow #

1460
01:36:25,855 --> 01:36:28,953
# To save me #

1461
01:36:29,055 --> 01:36:32,699
# Why, oh, why? #

1462
01:36:32,799 --> 01:36:34,457
# For pity's sake #

1463
01:36:34,558 --> 01:36:38,748
# They should have
saved themselves #

1464
01:36:42,621 --> 01:36:49,745
# But you, you always said
I never missed a note #

1465
01:36:54,781 --> 01:37:01,075
# And nobody ever knew me
like you do #

1466
01:37:06,523 --> 01:37:12,119
# You always said
it was gonna be okay #

1467
01:37:17,594 --> 01:37:23,507
# I only ever really
wanted to be with you. #
