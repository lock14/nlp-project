1
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,966
<i>I used to dream about flying.</i>

2
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,476
<i>It went the same way
every night-</i>

3
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:40,649
<i>I'd realize
that I could fly-</i>

4
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:42,749
<i>No, that's not
quite right.</i>

5
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:45,566
<i>I'd realize that there
was no reason I couldn't fly.</i>

6
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:48,958
<i>And after that,
I'd float off the ground</i>

7
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:51,382
<i>and soar above the city.</i>

8
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:54,297
<i>But I haven't had
that dream in a while now.</i>

9
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,138
<i>Lately I dream about
more ordinary things</i>

10
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:00,178
<i>like doing my laundry
or shopping for groceries</i>

11
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:02,644
<i>or riding on elevators.</i>

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,932
<i>I wonder
why that is.</i>

13
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,157
<i>Drug use, prescription
or otherwise?</i>

14
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:04,789
No.

15
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:06,828
<i>Do you experience
persistent headaches?</i>

16
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:08,251
No.

17
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:10,295
<i>- Trouble sleeping?
- No.</i>

18
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,124
<i>Any feelings
of lethargy?</i>

19
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:14,465
<i>- No.
- Lack of appetite?</i>

20
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:17,171
<i>Difficulty becoming
sexually aroused,</i>

21
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,636
<i>maintaining
an erection?</i>

22
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,758
<i>Problems with
premature ejaculation?</i>

23
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:22,515
No.

24
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:25,555
<i>What about thoughts of a
suicidal or homicidal nature?</i>

25
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:27,431
No.

26
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,103
You never fantasize about
hurting anybody-

27
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,605
yourself or others?

28
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:38,281
Well...

29
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:40,450
You know, sometimes,
I guess.

30
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:43,489
But, you know,
I would never act on it.

31
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:45,783
I understand.

32
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:51,205
And you're in
good health, so...

33
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,210
There you go.

34
00:02:59,505 --> 00:02:59,974
I'm in?

35
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:03,056
Take one pill a day,
preferably with food.

36
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:07,638
But wait, you don't- you don't have
to wait for my blood-test results?

37
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:09,020
No, we're good.

38
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,226
I just need your
John Hancock right there.

39
00:03:12,263 --> 00:03:15,360
And these- these-
these really work?

40
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,566
Our results have been
remarkably promising.

41
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:24,989
Okay.

42
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,456
And there.

43
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,328
And also there.

44
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:35,917
Welcome to
our study...

45
00:03:35,953 --> 00:03:37,632
Les.

46
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:39,801
And thank you.

47
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:42,840
'Cause you're not just
participating in a clinical trial,

48
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:45,048
you're helping develop
a medication

49
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,069
that will benefit
a great many people.

50
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:49,055
So you just pop in
here one time a week

51
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,932
so we can monitor
your progress.

52
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:55,561
And here's a free
T- shirt for you.

53
00:03:57,313 --> 00:03:59,607
can I take
the first one now?

54
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:00,691
Mmm.

55
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:08,950
And how long till
I start feeling...

56
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:11,035
you know, different?

57
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:30,888
<i>I've decided to start
this medication journal</i>

58
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:33,724
<i>so I don't forget anything
noteworthy between visits.</i>

59
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:37,412
<i>It's funny because I joined
the study on a whim.</i>

60
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,065
<i>You see, I'm really
pretty happy with my life.</i>

61
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:43,567
<i>Well, maybe "happy"
isn't the right word,</i>

62
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:45,528
<i>but I'm not unhappy.</i>

63
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:47,452
<i>It's more like</i>

64
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,074
<i>I once read about a monster
called the extricator</i>

65
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,206
<i>that lived off
people's souls.</i>

66
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:55,246
<i>Only the thing was, the extricator
ate a person's soul in their sleep</i>

67
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:57,044
<i>over a 16-year period.</i>

68
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:59,208
<i>Like it would nibble
off a crumb every night</i>

69
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,299
<i>until there wasn't
anything left,</i>

70
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,588
<i>so a person had no way to
realize what was going on.</i>

71
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,721
<i>They just had this
vague sense</i>

72
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:09,557
<i>that something was
slowly disappearing.</i>

73
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:13,347
<i>I don't know, maybe I am
a little depressed lately.</i>

74
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,774
Wait wait wait wait wait!

75
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,731
You have to stop.

76
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:27,617
I am so broke.

77
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:30,948
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I already
started writing the citation.

78
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:35,082
Um, listen, you could
park here all day

79
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:38,122
and I promise I won't-
I won't write another ticket,

80
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:40,374
But once I start
writing the ticket-

81
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,296
See, I get
reprimanded if-

82
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:47,506
Please...

83
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:57,892
<i>Oh, thank you!
Thank you so much!</i>

84
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:02,777
I'm sorry about that.

85
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:05,066
Some asshole was trying
to ticket me.

86
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,409
How many times
do I have to tell you?

87
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:13,866
We're not gonna take any
comics you find in a dumpster.

88
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:15,581
<i>End of story.</i>

89
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:18,079
What do you say, chief?
Five bucks?

90
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:20,539
What if someone
pissed on them?

91
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,920
I swear to God, if you
pay him for those, I'm-

92
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,882
You're a good little man.

93
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,014
And you-

94
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,345
You're a very bad
little man.

95
00:06:36,222 --> 00:06:37,395
Les?

96
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,725
Could you explain to
my retarded sibling here

97
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:41,983
that I can't keep the store
open if he insists

98
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:45,189
on throwing our money away
on crackhead piss comics?

99
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:48,067
I should- I probably
should go back to work.

100
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:49,693
Oh, Les, Les?
Come here, man.

101
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:53,661
Check it out-
I got you the new "Iron Woman,"

102
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,080
The new "Nightmare Killer"
and the new "Time Travel. "

103
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:56,359
Cool.

104
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:59,036
<i>I'm so sick of people
thinking "Time Travel"</i>

105
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:01,377
is all about some dude who
shows up from nowhere

106
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:04,750
saying, "I've come from the
future that will no longer exist,"

107
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:07,124
<i>and then fixes
your problems.</i>

108
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:09,463
<i>Don't let him
harsh you, Les.</i>

109
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,858
"Time Travel"
is seriously dope

110
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:14,218
in an old-school
kind of way.

111
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,519
Yo, if you want
to come by later,

112
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:21,058
we rented this crazy iranian
knockoff- "When Animals Attack. "

113
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:22,607
Yeah, man, come by.
Check it out.

114
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,438
Save me from another night
alone with Captain Piss Comic.

115
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:27,320
Sure.

116
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:28,774
Yeah, maybe.

117
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,521
<i>I know I'm too old to
like comics as much as I do,</i>

118
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:49,962
<i>but in comics, a villain can
launch a missile at a superhero</i>

119
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:52,261
<i>and the hero
just keeps coming.</i>

120
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:54,717
<i>And then the villain
can throw an atom bomb</i>

121
00:07:54,753 --> 00:07:57,136
<i>or an asteroid or an entire
planet at the hero,</i>

122
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:59,268
<i>but that won't
stop them either.</i>

123
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:02,104
<i>Because a real superhero
is like a force of nature.</i>

124
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:06,312
<i>And when I read comics, I get this
faint glimpse of what it would be like</i>

125
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:09,332
<i>to be not just
stronger, faster,</i>

126
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:12,345
<i>or smarter than
ordinary people,</i>

127
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:15,321
<i>but what it would
be like to be,</i>

128
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:18,949
<i>well, to be unstoppable.</i>

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,878
Les, Les, Les, Les.

130
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,465
You want to explain this
to me, champ?

131
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:35,680
Yeah, I'm sorry, Steve,
I just-

132
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,306
<i>I like you, kid.
I really do.</i>

133
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:40,763
But the money that
those parasites con from you,

134
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,183
it goes to schools,
hospitals, soup kitchens.

135
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,482
So really what
you're doing is,

136
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,146
you're helping them steal from
terminally-ill homeless children.

137
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:51,482
<i>- No, I know-
- I know it's tough out there.</i>

138
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:53,901
Believe me. Even our
fellow police officers

139
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:55,866
think we're some
kind of joke.

140
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,035
That's why you have to
remind yourself

141
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:00,908
that we are the ones that
keep this city running.

142
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:03,040
I know.

143
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:04,682
Then say it.

144
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,288
Pardon me?

145
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:09,667
The mantra exercise.

146
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,923
Look, I have seen this job snap
a lot tougher men than you, champ.

147
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,681
So unless you change
your attitude,

148
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:21,679
I'm afraid you're not gonna
last much longer around here.

149
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:28,102
I'm important and
I keep this city running.

150
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:29,734
Good.

151
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,982
Now repeat.

152
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:43,993
I'm important.

153
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:48,393
<i>6:48 P.M.</i>

154
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,708
<i>Still not feeling anything.</i>

155
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:23,026
Les?

156
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,370
Oh, man.

157
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:32,077
I think I just- I might be
too nervous or something.

158
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,876
Les- Les, what
are you doing?

159
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:42,755
Les, why don't you
come down from there

160
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,108
and we can talk
a little bit more?

161
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:49,219
Les?

162
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,808
No!

163
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,483
Amazing, isn't it?

164
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,772
It's quite unusual.
Are you hurt?

165
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:02,024
No no, I never felt better.
Why?

166
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,405
Well...

167
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,658
Hey, has this happened
to anyone else?

168
00:13:05,694 --> 00:13:08,530
No, I've never seen anything
quite like it before.

169
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,613
What do you think
caused this, Dr. Dobson?

170
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,659
Well, I think we have
to discuss that-

171
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:18,207
Could- could you
excuse me for a second?

172
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:20,005
Is something wrong?

173
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,003
Just don't move.
I- I'll be back in a moment or two.

174
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:31,053
<i>What seems to be-</i>

175
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:46,568
Sorry about that, Les.

176
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:48,880
Who are those people?

177
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,156
Please just follow me.

178
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,800
<i>Can you hear me, Les?</i>

179
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,319
Of course.

180
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:12,766
Excuse me?

181
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:14,972
<i>This room
could be bugged.</i>

182
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:16,640
How'd you do that?

183
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:17,938
Do what?

184
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:20,143
<i>I assume you've heard
of telepathy.</i>

185
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,645
You're telepathic?

186
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:22,943
What?

187
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,315
<i>I'm not telepathic, Les.
You are.</i>

188
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:26,447
I am?

189
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:28,902
- You are what?
- Telepathic.

190
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:41,623
<i>The drug bestowed you
with many powers.</i>

191
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,751
You're having an adverse
psychological reaction, Les.

192
00:14:44,788 --> 00:14:47,254
<i>You're reading
my mind right now.</i>

193
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,382
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

194
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:54,475
Why is this
happening to me?

195
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:57,264
The medication was designed
to suppress the chemicals

196
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,230
in the brain responsible
for self-doubt.

197
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:03,937
Unfortunately, brain chemistry
can be as unique

198
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:07,024
and as unpredictable
as a fingerprint.

199
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,026
Oh.

200
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:12,112
Okay.

201
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:19,119
So the medication unleashed
powers that I already had?

202
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:22,378
What do you mean
by powers?

203
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:25,417
<i>Never mention
your powers out loud.</i>

204
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:26,882
Why not?

205
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,592
<i>It isn't safe.</i>

206
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:32,179
The important thing is that you
cease the medication immediately.

207
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:36,053
<i>Luckily, it has a half-life that's
extremely short in the bloodstream.</i>

208
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:38,555
So whatever you're
experiencing should disappear

209
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,849
soon after you've ingested
your last dose.

210
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,982
<i>Can you hear me, Dr. Dobson?</i>

211
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,907
<i>Very good, Les.</i>

212
00:15:51,944 --> 00:15:54,780
<i>You're learning to control
your powers faster</i>

213
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:56,657
<i>than I would have
dreamed possible.</i>

214
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,827
- Les?
- Just a second.

215
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:06,797
<i>Should I really stop
taking the medication?</i>

216
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,816
<i>Heavens no. I just said that
because they're listening.</i>

217
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:12,798
<i>Keep taking one pill a day.
By the end of the cycle,</i>

218
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:15,092
<i>your powers
will be permanent.</i>

219
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,098
What are you
staring at, Les?

220
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:22,888
Sorry.

221
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:24,972
Um...

222
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,984
Okay.

223
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,486
So I'll just, um...

224
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:34,027
I'll just flush the rest
of the pills as-

225
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:35,779
as soon as I get home.

226
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:37,995
Good.

227
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,497
What's best for you
right now

228
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:44,037
is to go home,
have a good night's sleep,

229
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:46,289
get this all behind you.

230
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,127
Okay, I will.

231
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,802
<i>I'm also obliged
to remind you</i>

232
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:02,769
how seriously
this company takes the-

233
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:05,809
the nondisclosure section
of the contract you signed.

234
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:07,608
I understand, Dr. Dobson.

235
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:10,188
I won't say anything
I'm not supposed to.

236
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,696
If you have any problems
or concerns,

237
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:16,987
anything at all, this is
my personal phone number.

238
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:19,948
- Uh-huh.
- I want you to call me, anytime.

239
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:22,301
Thanks for everything.

240
00:17:22,338 --> 00:17:24,619
I really appreciate it.

241
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:28,290
<i>Take care, Les.</i>

242
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:37,888
<i>He could have simply asked,</i>

243
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:41,845
<i>but no, everything has to be a
passive-aggressive game with him.</i>

244
00:17:41,881 --> 00:17:45,348
<i>They should really get
better security in this place.</i>

245
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:51,646
<i>I'm fat, that's the problem.
I'm like a dump truck.</i>

246
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,115
<i>It's like there are
two kinds of people in this world-</i>

247
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:05,494
<i>Ones who feel bad when
rock stars kill themselves,</i>

248
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,788
<i>and the ones
who think it's funny.</i>

249
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,641
<i>Like a sweet, juicy peach.</i>

250
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:33,647
<i>Peach cobbler-
I could go for some peach cobbler.</i>

251
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:37,359
<i>I miss Thelma.</i>

252
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,241
<i>Condoms?</i>

253
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:22,868
<i>I don't see her for
two months</i>

254
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:25,073
<i>and when I finally do,
she's buying condoms?</i>

255
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,955
<i>with Chuck.</i>

256
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:30,203
<i>Oh, I have to sneak out
before they notice me.</i>

257
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,336
<i>Oh.</i>

258
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,250
<i>What if she spots me
trying to run away?</i>

259
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,549
<i>Don't be a sucker.</i>

260
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:45,844
<i>Don't be a little punk.</i>

261
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,807
<i>Just go over there and
shove the barrel in her face.</i>

262
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:53,101
<i>She'll give over
the cash.</i>

263
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:56,414
Can't you read, bitch?

264
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:57,754
Oh, shit.

265
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,043
Sorry, Les man.
I thought you were a customer.

266
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,258
Hey, can I come in?

267
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:03,880
Yeah, mi casa es
your casa, bro.

268
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:10,762
Les man, you won't believe some
of these customers today, dude.

269
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,643
They go totally ballistic
if they can't get their manga

270
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,608
exactly when they
want it, right?

271
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,814
Just knock knock knocking
all day long.

272
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,195
Is Everett here?

273
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:24,448
'Cause I need to
show you guys something.

274
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,237
Yeah, dude, just go on back
and take a mental-health day.

275
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:37,335
<i>Les, my friend.</i>

276
00:21:37,372 --> 00:21:40,338
Hey, explain to
my retarded sibling here-

277
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,752
Just because something
has a force field, right?

278
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:44,551
It doesn't mean it
has to be invisible.

279
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:47,215
Don't even get into it
with him, Les, all right?

280
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,944
He's been in
extra-cranky mode all day.

281
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,637
Listen, I have to
tell you guys something.

282
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:54,311
What is it, Les?

283
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,558
First you have to promise
you won't tell anyone.

284
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:58,315
Tell anyone what?

285
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,192
Just promise me you're
not gonna tell anybody.

286
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:02,439
What are we, the fucking
Boy Scouts all of a sudden?

287
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:04,125
I'm serious.

288
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:05,775
I promise, Les.

289
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:11,156
You satisfied, or do we
need to pinkie swear too?

290
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:13,330
Okay.

291
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,285
The thing is...

292
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,541
I have super-powers.

293
00:22:23,835 --> 00:22:26,254
You guys,
I'm serious.

294
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,673
Oh, you-
you got me, Les.

295
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,341
That was priceless.

296
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:41,311
You're thinking
about pizza.

297
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:47,275
And you're thinking
I'm full of crap.

298
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:50,278
But now you're thinking
about pizza too-

299
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:53,203
No cheese, extra olives.

300
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:57,994
That is some serious
David Blaine trickery, my friend.

301
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:00,306
I'm telling you,
it's no trick.

302
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:02,546
And not only
do I have powers,

303
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,714
But they're developing
like gangbusters.

304
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,295
Even on the way over here,
I discovered a new one.

305
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:11,091
What was this new power,
o puissant one?

306
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:13,426
You really want
to see it?

307
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:15,428
Yeah.

308
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,656
God damn, Les.

309
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:31,861
That was punk rock,
bro.

310
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:35,865
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

311
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:39,416
The more difficult powers-

312
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:44,207
it seems to exact a slight
physical toll.

313
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:51,881
So what do you plan on doing
with these awesome powers?

314
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:55,557
Oh, that's what I wanted to
talk to you guys about, see?

315
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:58,935
<i>I understand the
need to keep our secret,</i>

316
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:03,309
<i>but stopping that robbery today
was the first time in my whole life</i>

317
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:05,275
<i>that I've ever felt like...</i>

318
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,944
I could really make
a difference in the world,

319
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:10,316
like I could do something
that nobody else can do-

320
00:24:10,353 --> 00:24:12,420
something important,

321
00:24:12,456 --> 00:24:14,487
maybe even necessary.

322
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:19,539
So I talked about it
with my friends

323
00:24:19,576 --> 00:24:21,875
and they agree that if
a person doesn't do good

324
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:24,414
with the gifts they're given,
well, that's almost worse

325
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,624
than doing evil,
isn't it?

326
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:31,593
I have no idea what
you're talking about, Les.

327
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:34,466
But if you leave here without
giving me a month's notice,

328
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:37,760
you can kiss my letter
of recommendation goodbye.

329
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:39,137
I understand.

330
00:24:40,472 --> 00:24:43,641
Did one of those lowlifes
make you feel guilty again?

331
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:45,941
Is that what this is about?
Because if it is-

332
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:49,105
I'm sorry, Steve, but I've
told you as much as I can.

333
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:51,232
Excuse me.

334
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:26,643
<i>The costume is obviously integral</i>

335
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:28,149
<i>for any superhero.</i>

336
00:25:28,186 --> 00:25:31,231
<i>It can protect
the hero's true identity,</i>

337
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:33,605
<i>it can inspire fear,</i>

338
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:35,944
<i>curiosity or amazement.</i>

339
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,201
<i>But in my opinion,</i>

340
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:41,241
<i>the most important
part of a costume</i>

341
00:25:41,277 --> 00:25:42,956
<i>is what goes
on the back of it.</i>

342
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:44,953
<i>Because it's not just
the hero's name,</i>

343
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:47,077
<i>it's their message
to the public.</i>

344
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,129
<i>I want my costume
to tell people</i>

345
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:52,669
<i>that they shouldn't give up no
matter how alone they sometimes feel.</i>

346
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:55,171
<i>Because anything
is possible.</i>

347
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:07,660
<i>It turns out that
being a superhero</i>

348
00:27:07,697 --> 00:27:09,912
<i>was like many other
things in life:</i>

349
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:12,128
<i>When you want to avoid it,</i>

350
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,271
<i>crime seems like
it's everywhere,</i>

351
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:16,447
<i>but when you're
looking for it,</i>

352
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:18,588
<i>crime is nowhere
to be found.</i>

353
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:27,221
<i>That's why you have to learn
to always trust your instincts.</i>

354
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:07,845
Whoa, Candy,
that had to hurt.

355
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:09,686
You can say that again,
Chuck.

356
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:12,225
Now let's take
one more look at it.

357
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:28,408
If you have any information
about this bizarre local case,

358
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:32,078
that number again
is 1-800-555-8477.

359
00:28:32,114 --> 00:28:35,628
1-800-555-tips.

360
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:37,917
Our mad tackler
is caucasian,

361
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:40,133
approximately
six feet tall,

362
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:42,547
and is wearing
a white leather suit

363
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,924
with an unexplained symbol
on the back.

364
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:52,432
I think we have
a problem.

365
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:58,062
<i>Before all this happened,</i>

366
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:00,311
<i>I assumed a superhero
would be free</i>

367
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:02,488
<i>from everyday fear
and insecurity.</i>

368
00:29:02,525 --> 00:29:05,528
<i>But I'm discovering that
when the costume comes off,</i>

369
00:29:05,564 --> 00:29:07,905
<i>some of the most simple
things in life</i>

370
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:09,949
<i>still feel
the most dangerous.</i>

371
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,998
<i>Hey.</i>

372
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:22,795
So that was pretty crazy
the other day, huh?

373
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,759
With the guy and
the gun and everything.

374
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:36,184
But maybe that kind of thing
happens a lot in your line of work.

375
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:46,277
Well, I guess I'll-
I'll see you around.

376
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:51,120
I'm sorry.

377
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:54,869
Do you know,
what I wanted to say is-

378
00:29:56,788 --> 00:29:58,915
I wanted to ask you-

379
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,544
I wanted to know if you-

380
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:07,256
you wanted to have-

381
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:13,346
you can...
Keep the change.

382
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,209
<i>I suppose the
main point to get across here</i>

383
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:45,133
<i>is that even with
good instincts,</i>

384
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:48,714
<i>the life of a crime fighter
takes a small adjustment period.</i>

385
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:50,800
<i>And even then it's difficult
to understand</i>

386
00:30:50,836 --> 00:30:53,135
<i>exactly what's
going on sometimes.</i>

387
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,539
<i>That's why I've decided
to pursue</i>

388
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:23,499
<i>a more conventional
work environment.</i>

389
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,810
Excuse me, officer?

390
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:40,521
I can't tell you
my real name,

391
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,061
- but I used to work here.
- You're a cop?

392
00:31:44,098 --> 00:31:45,360
Pardon me?

393
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:48,774
No, um, parking enforcement.

394
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:50,865
<i>But, uh...</i>

395
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:52,992
that's all in the past.

396
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:56,449
Anyway, there's something
you need to see.

397
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:03,706
Pretty solid wall, huh?

398
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:04,916
Yeah.

399
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:07,293
Or it seems that way
to most people,

400
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,378
but the truth is...

401
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:16,761
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

402
00:32:26,187 --> 00:32:29,821
I'm not like most people.

403
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:33,152
<i>- Yeah, I can see that.
- Who can I talk to?</i>

404
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:34,450
Talk to?

405
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:36,953
About helping out,

406
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:39,325
putting this stuff to work.

407
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:40,998
You know?

408
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:42,792
Fighting crimes.

409
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,456
<i>I've had some luck
recently,</i>

410
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:48,748
<i>mostly small stuff-</i>

411
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:52,004
Shoplifting,
armed robbery.

412
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,595
You're an armed robber?

413
00:32:54,632 --> 00:32:57,322
No, I stop crimes,
officer.

414
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:59,915
Convenience-store
stuff mostly.

415
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:02,473
But I think I'm ready
to move up.

416
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:05,434
You know,
I've heard of you.

417
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,772
<i>I was thinking
we could...</i>

418
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:12,358
<i>develop some sort
of signal.</i>

419
00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:14,115
You know?

420
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:16,487
It doesn't have to be as
complicated as the bat signal.

421
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:19,320
In the meantime,

422
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:21,613
here's my card.

423
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:23,869
Take one of those.

424
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:27,420
<i>Pager number on it.
You-</i>

425
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:29,625
You give me a call
anytime you need something

426
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:32,091
and I'll be right there.

427
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:34,797
Actually, I think I've got
something for you right now.

428
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:37,013
Really?

429
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:40,803
There's this loon going around
tackling innocent people.

430
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,513
Right?

431
00:33:57,611 --> 00:33:59,655
<i>Get in, Les.</i>

432
00:34:14,754 --> 00:34:17,298
Crazy metermaids.

433
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:19,842
That was exciting.

434
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:25,222
You have a genuine flair for
making a scene, don't you, Les?

435
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:28,434
<i>Maybe you're trying to
get on television again,</i>

436
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,187
maybe something national
this time.

437
00:34:31,223 --> 00:34:32,688
Who are you?

438
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:38,282
My name is Jonas Exiler.

439
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:40,488
And this is my brother
Theodore.

440
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:43,746
Maybe you know us
as the...

441
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:47,203
people whose dreams you're
trying to flush down the toilet.

442
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:51,749
We've spent the last
five years of our lives

443
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:53,923
and every penny
we've ever saved

444
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:57,505
trying to get this company
off the ground, Les.

445
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,465
It's been an uphill battle,

446
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:02,009
<i>Believe me.</i>

447
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:05,846
You're telepathic too?

448
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,062
You're a deeply troubled
individual, aren't you, buddy?

449
00:35:13,098 --> 00:35:17,530
We want to help you, Les.
Can you understand that?

450
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:19,735
You have to realize that
the reaction that you're having

451
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:21,450
<i>is a complete anomaly.</i>

452
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:24,490
<i>And really, there's no proof
the special is responsible</i>

453
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:26,455
<i>for anything
you're feeling right now.</i>

454
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,953
<i>You could just be experiencing
some sort of unrelated...</i>

455
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:32,498
What?

456
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,800
Fucking hell.

457
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:40,469
I- I can't do that.

458
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:44,072
Can you understand anything
we're trying to tell you, Les?

459
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,638
- I will never join you.
- The medication is making you sick.

460
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:49,145
All you have to do

461
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:52,231
is stop taking
the medication.

462
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:54,749
And stop running around
in that silly suit.

463
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,194
- That's all we're asking here.
- Never.

464
00:35:57,231 --> 00:35:59,817
We could sue you to hell and
back for running around on TV

465
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:01,907
wearing our logo.
You understand that, right?

466
00:36:01,944 --> 00:36:04,780
But we'd just as soon avoid any
negative publicity right now.

467
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:07,908
Just stop taking the pills.

468
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,287
We can put all this
behind us.

469
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:22,464
Well, then we have
a problem...

470
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,099
Don't we?

471
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:29,471
- Because the way I see it-
- Who are you?

472
00:36:29,508 --> 00:36:31,700
I come from the future

473
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:33,503
that will no longer exist.

474
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,232
Who is he talking to now?

475
00:36:35,269 --> 00:36:38,418
These are the men
that convinced the police

476
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:41,567
- that you did something wrong.
- Of course.

477
00:36:41,603 --> 00:36:43,532
Les?

478
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:46,911
Earth to Les.

479
00:36:46,947 --> 00:36:50,242
They designed the drug to build
an army of unstoppable assassins.

480
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:52,124
And if you won't work
for them,

481
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:54,163
they'll try to
strip you of your powers.

482
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:00,424
- Or worse.
- Worse?

483
00:37:00,461 --> 00:37:03,005
- Much worse.
- I told you this was a bad idea.

484
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,720
<i>But don't worry...</i>

485
00:37:04,757 --> 00:37:07,473
Because I won't
let that happen.

486
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:09,345
- Let's just take him to the E.R.
- The E.R.?

487
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:13,807
- Are you crazy-
- No!

488
00:37:15,184 --> 00:37:18,020
Ow.

489
00:37:31,742 --> 00:37:33,744
Don't just stare at him.

490
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,204
Get him.

491
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:18,497
Ahhh!

492
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:30,509
<i>How do you
like my invisible force field?</i>

493
00:38:40,978 --> 00:38:43,897
Not much oxygen inside,
is there?

494
00:38:43,934 --> 00:38:45,821
Ahh!

495
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:49,028
You should have joined us
when you had the chance.

496
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:15,267
Your force field is good,

497
00:39:15,304 --> 00:39:18,932
but my teleporting
is better.

498
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,083
Yes!

499
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,789
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, you love that shit.

500
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:43,587
Whoo!
Ha ha!

501
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:45,256
- Oh, shit.
- Fucking game.

502
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:47,190
This is the best game
ever invent-

503
00:39:47,226 --> 00:39:49,051
Les! Les,
man, what's going on?

504
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:52,174
Yeah, man, Antoine said he saw
you on the idiot box or something.

505
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,926
- Bad outfit, by the way.
- Oh, yeah.

506
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:55,850
Do you-
do you know him?

507
00:39:55,886 --> 00:39:57,685
Yeah, he comes in here
sometimes.

508
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:59,723
- Are you okay?
- I'm good. How are you?

509
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,689
Yeah, I'm good.
Listen, we have to talk.

510
00:40:01,725 --> 00:40:02,518
<i>What's up?</i>

511
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,895
After I started using
my powers to help people,

512
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:06,861
these two brothers
in suits showed up.

513
00:40:06,897 --> 00:40:09,942
And since I wouldn't join them,
they're trying to destroy me.

514
00:40:09,978 --> 00:40:11,615
- What?
- Yeah.

515
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:14,238
And I think they might have
some control over the news media

516
00:40:14,274 --> 00:40:16,203
and maybe
even the police.

517
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,455
Yeah, because when I
came back from the future,

518
00:40:18,492 --> 00:40:22,496
they managed to frame me for
crimes that I didn't commit.

519
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,875
You're serious about this,
aren't you?

520
00:40:26,912 --> 00:40:29,169
Of course.

521
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:33,220
Uh- uh, I'm sorry.

522
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:36,635
<i>Um, I'm sorry, everybody, but
we're closing up early today.</i>

523
00:40:36,672 --> 00:40:38,637
<i>You gotta go.
I'm sorry.</i>

524
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,182
But I want to buy this.

525
00:40:42,224 --> 00:40:45,185
Flamethrower defeats the eye
in a prolonged and bloody battle

526
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:47,276
wherein we learn that
the woolian's death

527
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,356
was a complex Morovian
subterfuge, okay, buddy?

528
00:40:49,398 --> 00:40:52,901
- Get the fuck out.
- Sorry, man. Come back tomorrow.

529
00:40:52,938 --> 00:40:54,325
<i>- Listen, Les...
- Les?</i>

530
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:57,364
Hey, no no no.
You could shut those, Everett.

531
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:59,241
Shut that.

532
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:05,544
<i>- Yeah.
- Les? Les, Les,</i>

533
00:41:05,581 --> 00:41:07,958
- The thing is, man-
- You don't have super-powers.

534
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:10,466
No no.
What do you mean?

535
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:13,130
We just thought you were
screwing around with us, you know?

536
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,254
But you saw the thing
with the wall- you saw that.

537
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,342
- You mean you running into it?
- You mean through it.

538
00:41:17,379 --> 00:41:19,219
- I mean into it.
- You mean through it!

539
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:22,598
Les, we were just
really high.

540
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:24,480
Jesus, Les,

541
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:26,602
What happened
to you, man?

542
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:38,994
Okay, you guys.
Okay, you got me.

543
00:41:39,031 --> 00:41:41,455
But this is no time
for fooling around.

544
00:41:41,492 --> 00:41:43,952
You know, we have to figure
out what to do about the suits.

545
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:45,805
There are no suits, Les.
There's no suits,

546
00:41:45,842 --> 00:41:47,586
- there's no super-powers-
- And Les,

547
00:41:47,623 --> 00:41:49,755
Les, you know you're our bro
no matter what, man, but-

548
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:52,586
You're losing your mind, man.
You're losing your fucking mind.

549
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:54,710
Really?
If I don't have powers,

550
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,798
then how do you
explain this?

551
00:41:58,175 --> 00:41:59,760
Explain what?

552
00:41:59,796 --> 00:42:01,762
This.

553
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,479
You can't see this, Joey?

554
00:42:05,516 --> 00:42:07,601
You're just reaching
your arms out.

555
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:09,186
You honestly
can't see this?

556
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:12,481
I don't know what
I'm supposed to see-

557
00:42:12,517 --> 00:42:13,946
- Joey!
- Les,

558
00:42:13,982 --> 00:42:16,276
I don't know what
I'm supposed to see.

559
00:42:16,313 --> 00:42:18,575
Everett?

560
00:42:18,612 --> 00:42:21,073
Les, man,
I can do it too.

561
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,370
Okay.

562
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,557
They must have-

563
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:43,554
They must have
already got to you.

564
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,847
Who got to us, Les?

565
00:42:45,884 --> 00:42:47,229
The suits!

566
00:42:47,266 --> 00:42:50,232
The suits- they know
that you're my friends,

567
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:53,605
so they must have put you
in some sort of mind shield

568
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:56,275
so that you can't
see my powers.

569
00:42:56,311 --> 00:42:59,616
Mmm.
It's genius.

570
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:01,905
No no no, Les, Les,
it's totally-

571
00:43:01,942 --> 00:43:04,163
Crazy! Crazy, right?

572
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:07,619
They want me to think
that I'm going crazy.

573
00:43:07,656 --> 00:43:09,251
Les-

574
00:43:09,288 --> 00:43:10,706
That's how they
like it.

575
00:43:10,742 --> 00:43:13,172
Les, Les...

576
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:16,420
I think we might need to
get you some medical attention.

577
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:19,673
Is there a doctor or someone
we could take you to?

578
00:43:23,844 --> 00:43:25,554
That's a good idea.

579
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:52,664
Do you really think
he's taking-

580
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:54,666
taking us to
a real doctor...

581
00:43:54,703 --> 00:43:56,793
Or just an imaginary one?

582
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:02,262
Don't worry.

583
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:04,718
Dr. Dobson will
explain everything.

584
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,308
Stop the car!

585
00:44:12,184 --> 00:44:15,562
- What the hell?
- Where'd he go?

586
00:44:17,105 --> 00:44:19,608
There he is.

587
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,241
Les!

588
00:44:22,277 --> 00:44:24,780
What are you doing, man?
Get down from there.

589
00:44:24,816 --> 00:44:27,282
Somebody stole my purse!
He stole my purse.

590
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,284
- Don't worry, ma'am.
- No!

591
00:44:35,624 --> 00:44:37,396
I've got it.

592
00:44:37,433 --> 00:44:39,169
Thank you.

593
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,427
Ma'am,
in the future,

594
00:44:42,464 --> 00:44:44,758
please be careful walking
around this neighborhood

595
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,531
after dark.

596
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:48,261
I will.

597
00:44:54,768 --> 00:44:56,853
It's like a move
straight out of "Urban War. "

598
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,456
You just- booyah!

599
00:44:58,492 --> 00:44:59,987
Quit encouraging him.

600
00:45:00,023 --> 00:45:02,489
You could have seriously
messed yourself up, dude.

601
00:45:02,526 --> 00:45:05,362
Why is it so hard for you to
believe that I have special powers?

602
00:45:05,398 --> 00:45:08,365
Special powers?
Are you listening to yourself?

603
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:10,247
People don't have
special powers.

604
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:12,332
- I believe you, Les.
- No, you don't.

605
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:14,705
Yes, I do. How else could
he have done what he did?

606
00:45:14,741 --> 00:45:16,503
- It was awesome.
- It was stupid.

607
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,875
You wouldn't recognize a miracle
if it bit you in your ass.

608
00:45:18,912 --> 00:45:21,145
- A miracle?
- Yes, a miracle.

609
00:45:21,182 --> 00:45:23,343
Miracles don't exist,
Joey.

610
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:27,384
You have become such a
downer lately, you know that?

611
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,308
Look, Les,

612
00:45:29,344 --> 00:45:33,056
You're part of a very small
group of people on this earth

613
00:45:33,093 --> 00:45:35,159
I actually give
a shit about, okay?

614
00:45:35,196 --> 00:45:37,463
Not because you got
special powers,

615
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:39,693
but because- well,
because you're you.

616
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,732
So I just can't fucking handle you
trying to kill yourself right now, okay?

617
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:44,648
Can you understand that?

618
00:45:44,684 --> 00:45:46,491
Yes, I can, Everett.

619
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:49,322
You can doubt my powers
all you want,

620
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,117
but you're about
to discover the truth.

621
00:46:02,753 --> 00:46:05,005
Dr. Dobson?

622
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:07,429
Can I help you?

623
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:10,406
It's okay.
We can trust them.

624
00:46:10,442 --> 00:46:13,346
Is this man
a friend of yours?

625
00:46:15,015 --> 00:46:17,356
You're not his doctor?

626
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:19,269
<i>For some
inexplicable reason,</i>

627
00:46:19,305 --> 00:46:21,151
he seems to be
under that impression.

628
00:46:21,188 --> 00:46:24,149
<i>He came around the other day
claiming to be part</i>

629
00:46:24,185 --> 00:46:25,864
of a medical study
we're conducting.

630
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:28,090
No no, we don't have time
for all this secrecy.

631
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:30,350
Okay? The suits, they already
know about my powers

632
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:32,574
and they somehow-
they brainwashed my friends.

633
00:46:34,451 --> 00:46:37,793
Okay? You have to
tell them everything.

634
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:40,832
I'm sorry, young man, but if
you come around here again,

635
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:42,769
I'll be forced
to call security.

636
00:46:42,805 --> 00:46:44,669
That won't be
necessary, sir.

637
00:46:44,706 --> 00:46:46,376
No, it's okay.

638
00:46:46,413 --> 00:46:48,011
We have to go.

639
00:46:48,048 --> 00:46:50,842
No! You have to warn them.
You have to tell them-

640
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,141
you have to tell them
about the suits.

641
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:56,890
Okay? They're after me. They could be
after all of us. These are my friends.

642
00:46:56,932 --> 00:47:00,185
I don't have any idea what
you're talking about, young man.

643
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:02,192
- The suits!
- Don't worry about the suits, Les.

644
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:04,481
- It's gonna be okay. Let's go.
- You don't understand!

645
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:07,150
Okay, they're very-
they're very powerful.

646
00:47:07,187 --> 00:47:09,319
They're very-
they're scary people.

647
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:11,451
That's why he's
packing up.

648
00:47:11,488 --> 00:47:14,324
Okay? That's why
he's scared, because-

649
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,368
see, he's running away,
you see?

650
00:47:16,404 --> 00:47:18,500
<i>He's running away.</i>

651
00:47:18,537 --> 00:47:22,170
I suspect your friend has ingested
some relatively harmless narcotic.

652
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:26,127
Have him drink this. It'll help clean
any residual chemicals in his system

653
00:47:26,164 --> 00:47:27,843
before it's absorbed
in his bloodstream.

654
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:30,090
Wait about six hours or so.
If he doesn't seem any better,

655
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:32,133
take him to
the Emergency Room. Okay?

656
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,682
Okay.

657
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:35,720
- Ahh!
- No no no no no.

658
00:47:35,757 --> 00:47:37,949
<i>Hee! Huh?</i>

659
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:40,127
What is this?

660
00:47:40,163 --> 00:47:42,232
The antidote?

661
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:45,110
This is the antidote,
isn't it?

662
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:47,946
Drinking this will
take away my powers?

663
00:47:47,983 --> 00:47:51,116
No no, it's gonna
strengthen your powers, Les.

664
00:47:51,152 --> 00:47:53,822
Les, if you drink that, man,
it's gonna strengthen your powers.

665
00:47:53,858 --> 00:47:56,621
Yeah yeah yeah.
Les Les, please. Please.

666
00:47:56,658 --> 00:47:59,035
- Just take it. It's not a big deal.
- You think I'm stupid?

667
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:01,162
- No, Les-
- You think I don't know what's going on?

668
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:03,003
No, I know that
you know what's-

669
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:05,083
- You don't know what's going on.
- We have to go, Les.

670
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,915
You're the one who doesn't
know what's going on.

671
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:08,712
- No, I do know-
- You don't know what's going on.

672
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:11,965
Okay? You're the one
who doesn't have a clue.

673
00:48:12,007 --> 00:48:14,806
I have a clue.
Not you, me.

674
00:48:14,843 --> 00:48:17,262
Come on, man, let him go.
You're scaring the shit out of him.

675
00:48:17,298 --> 00:48:19,598
Sorry, Les.

676
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:23,810
Haa!

677
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:58,887
"I saw a piece of shit on
the sidewalk the other day-

678
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:02,521
not dog-shit,
but from a person

679
00:49:02,557 --> 00:49:04,272
<i>and it made me
feel so hopeless,</i>

680
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:07,729
not just for whoever went there,
but for every person on the planet,

681
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:09,981
if you know what I mean. "

682
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:15,737
I told you he was a basketcase
before he ever came to us.

683
00:49:15,773 --> 00:49:17,702
<i>Put that down,
please.</i>

684
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:19,574
<i>Help me look
for the pills.</i>

685
00:49:19,611 --> 00:49:21,373
<i>Forget
about the pills.</i>

686
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:23,662
<i>What do you mean,
forget about the pills?</i>

687
00:49:23,698 --> 00:49:25,747
I say we wait for him
to come home,

688
00:49:25,783 --> 00:49:28,541
we knock the fucker out...

689
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:32,462
tie him up for
a few days

690
00:49:32,504 --> 00:49:34,631
<i>and wait for
his powers to go away.</i>

691
00:49:34,673 --> 00:49:36,487
<i>What do you say?</i>

692
00:49:36,523 --> 00:49:38,301
You can't be serious.

693
00:49:38,338 --> 00:49:39,766
Why not?

694
00:49:39,803 --> 00:49:43,223
We're not dealing with the
kind of people we're used to.

695
00:49:43,259 --> 00:49:46,643
This kind of guy could disappear
off the face of the earth

696
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:48,746
for a few days,

697
00:49:48,782 --> 00:49:50,814
Nobody would care.

698
00:49:53,483 --> 00:49:55,568
<i>Nobody would
even notice.</i>

699
00:49:59,155 --> 00:50:01,825
No no no no no,
I am out.

700
00:50:01,861 --> 00:50:03,957
I don't care anymore.

701
00:50:03,994 --> 00:50:06,663
This kid's gonna get hurt
running around in that state.

702
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:08,753
So what if
we lose everything?

703
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,501
At least I can get back to
getting some sleep at night.

704
00:50:11,537 --> 00:50:13,717
Well, excuse me
for not giving a crap,

705
00:50:13,753 --> 00:50:16,423
but I can't seem to muster up
any sympathy for you right now.

706
00:50:22,262 --> 00:50:23,888
Ahh!

707
00:50:25,974 --> 00:50:28,184
Remember me now,
Dobson?

708
00:50:34,149 --> 00:50:35,442
Leave 'em off.

709
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:37,444
I said off!

710
00:50:41,489 --> 00:50:44,284
You didn't really think you could
get away this easily, did you?

711
00:50:44,325 --> 00:50:46,374
Huh?

712
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:48,705
Okay, turn on
the lights.

713
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:50,999
<i>Not the overhead one!</i>

714
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,626
This one.

715
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,678
Don't try anything funny.

716
00:50:58,715 --> 00:51:01,556
You understand me?
Don't do it.

717
00:51:01,593 --> 00:51:04,596
You're not gonna find
your file there.

718
00:51:04,632 --> 00:51:06,061
I don't believe you
anymore.

719
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:08,308
I don't believe anything you say.
You're a liar.

720
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:10,101
They made me shred it.

721
00:51:10,138 --> 00:51:11,399
Yeah, right.

722
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:13,938
Listen, Les, I'm very
sorry for everything-

723
00:51:13,939 --> 00:51:14,272
Ha!

724
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:17,567
Ha! Ha!
So you admit knowing me?

725
00:51:17,603 --> 00:51:18,949
Of course I know you.

726
00:51:18,985 --> 00:51:21,863
You're working for
the suits, aren't you?

727
00:51:21,899 --> 00:51:24,032
Maybe you should
take a seat.

728
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,958
No, I'm fine standing.

729
00:51:33,995 --> 00:51:35,770
Can I sit down?

730
00:51:35,806 --> 00:51:39,464
You sit down.

731
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:47,806
You have to understand
how much time and energy

732
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:50,475
I put into developing
this medication.

733
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:53,224
It became my whole life.

734
00:51:53,261 --> 00:51:55,939
- When?
- Pardon me?

735
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:59,239
When did you turn on me?

736
00:51:59,275 --> 00:52:03,410
We tested Specioprin
on thousands of subjects,

737
00:52:03,446 --> 00:52:06,991
but you were the first and only one
to have an adverse reaction like this.

738
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:09,541
No, but this is not
an adverse reaction.

739
00:52:09,577 --> 00:52:11,913
You wanted me to feel better.
You told me that.

740
00:52:11,949 --> 00:52:14,129
- You wanted this to happen.
- No.

741
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:18,378
A few weeks ago, we got an offer-
that's what I wanted to happen.

742
00:52:18,419 --> 00:52:20,672
What do you mean, offer?

743
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:22,470
To buy us out-

744
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:24,806
The drug,
all our research,

745
00:52:24,843 --> 00:52:27,178
the whole operation was
going to be absorbed

746
00:52:27,215 --> 00:52:30,145
by a sizeable corporation.
That's-

747
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:34,498
- that's what we worked all this time for.

748
00:52:34,535 --> 00:52:38,815
We were afraid that your
results would scare them off.

749
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:45,702
So this is-

750
00:52:45,738 --> 00:52:48,246
This is about money?

751
00:52:48,283 --> 00:52:50,931
We've done a terrible
injustice to you, Les,

752
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:53,580
And there's nothing
I can do about it now.

753
00:52:53,616 --> 00:52:56,421
But I've told
my partners I'm out.

754
00:52:56,457 --> 00:52:59,460
And I'll confirm your story
should you decide to

755
00:52:59,497 --> 00:53:02,260
take legal action.
And if you ask me,

756
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:04,716
you'll have a very strong
case against all of us.

757
00:53:04,752 --> 00:53:08,183
But, Les,
it's very important

758
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:10,805
that we get the medication
out of your system.

759
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:12,604
<i>- No. Never.
- Yes.</i>

760
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,059
I'll never let you
take my powers away.

761
00:53:15,096 --> 00:53:17,651
Give me the pills, Les.
Les!

762
00:53:17,687 --> 00:53:21,274
No no! Come on, spit 'em out.
Spit 'em out, Les.

763
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,651
Spit 'em out.
Come on, spit 'em out.

764
00:53:23,688 --> 00:53:25,612
Les!

765
00:53:26,738 --> 00:53:28,536
You can never take
my powers away-

766
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:32,368
You can never- you can never turn
me back into the person I used to be.

767
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:34,704
Nobody can!
Nobody can.

768
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:54,349
So, nice to
see you again.

769
00:53:56,392 --> 00:53:58,316
You don't scare me
anymore.

770
00:53:58,353 --> 00:54:01,689
Good. Then why don't you get
in and we can have a nice talk?

771
00:54:01,726 --> 00:54:04,864
You can't stop me now.
I'm too powerful.

772
00:54:04,901 --> 00:54:07,570
I'm not the kind of man
who takes kindly to threats-

773
00:54:07,607 --> 00:54:10,073
I know exactly
what kind of man you are.

774
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:15,828
I've been dealing with guys
like you my whole life.

775
00:54:19,374 --> 00:54:21,668
You think you're
so much more important

776
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:23,461
than everyone else,

777
00:54:25,088 --> 00:54:28,841
that you can do whatever
you want to whoever you want.

778
00:54:28,878 --> 00:54:32,011
Who do you think would care
if you disappeared?

779
00:54:34,347 --> 00:54:36,703
Who would care
about that, huh?

780
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,023
Who would care about
that, huh?

781
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:42,063
Do you think that anyone
would actually care

782
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:44,232
if you disappeared?

783
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:45,858
Pardon me?

784
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,538
What the hell
is he doing now?

785
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:09,679
This is no time
for Tai Chi, Les.

786
00:55:09,716 --> 00:55:13,261
We're willing to negotiate
a very fair deal with you.

787
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:29,944
Try to make me disappear?

788
00:55:31,612 --> 00:55:33,781
I'll make you disappear.

789
00:55:33,818 --> 00:55:35,867
Huh?

790
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:19,869
Ohh!

791
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:25,500
<i>You have no idea what
kind of man I am, motherfucker.</i>

792
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:33,633
Dahh!

793
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:41,641
Ahh!

794
00:56:41,677 --> 00:56:42,850
Ooh!

795
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,863
<i>You think Dobson
could protect you,</i>

796
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,991
<i>him and his sudden
burst of conscience?</i>

797
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:16,556
<i>Take it easy, Jonas.</i>

798
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:18,678
<i>You don't want to
kill the guy.</i>

799
00:57:18,714 --> 00:57:21,097
<i>Why not? You heard him.</i>

800
00:57:21,133 --> 00:57:22,687
<i>He's too powerful!</i>

801
00:57:22,723 --> 00:57:24,892
<i>He thinks he can make it
all disappear.</i>

802
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:26,524
<i>He thinks he can sue us.</i>

803
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:28,646
<i>He thinks he can
make it all disappear,</i>

804
00:57:28,683 --> 00:57:30,361
<i>everything we've
worked for!</i>

805
00:57:30,398 --> 00:57:32,796
<i>He thinks he can
make it all disappear!</i>

806
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:35,194
<i>You want to
let that happen, Theodore?</i>

807
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:38,578
<i>Everything we've
worked for-</i>

808
00:57:38,614 --> 00:57:41,701
<i>you want to have it ruined
by some maggot like this guy?</i>

809
00:57:41,737 --> 00:57:43,619
<i>Some nobody!</i>

810
00:57:43,656 --> 00:57:45,288
<i>Stop it, Jonas!</i>

811
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:51,711
<i>You're a worthless piece of shit!</i>

812
00:57:51,752 --> 00:57:54,046
<i>- Say it!
- Ooh!</i>

813
00:57:54,088 --> 00:57:56,007
<i>You're a nobody!</i>

814
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:57,805
I'm a worthless-

815
00:57:57,842 --> 00:57:59,886
<i>You're a nobody!</i>

816
00:57:59,927 --> 00:58:03,055
Oh! Ooh!
I'm a nobody.

817
00:58:03,097 --> 00:58:05,224
<i>You're nothing!</i>

818
00:58:05,261 --> 00:58:06,684
Oh!

819
00:58:12,398 --> 00:58:14,525
<i>You're nothing!</i>

820
00:58:14,562 --> 00:58:16,652
I'm nothing.
I'm nothing.

821
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:21,157
<i>You're a worthless
piece of shit.</i>

822
00:58:21,193 --> 00:58:23,159
Oh!

823
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:25,137
I'm a worthless

824
00:58:25,173 --> 00:58:27,079
piece of shit.

825
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:34,274
Oh!

826
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:36,756
I'm a worthless
piece of shit.

827
00:58:39,675 --> 00:58:41,594
Oooh!

828
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:45,973
Stop it. Ow.

829
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,612
<i>I swear,</i>

830
00:58:54,649 --> 00:58:56,525
<i>if I ever see you again,</i>

831
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:59,487
<i>if I ever hear from
you again, you're a dead man.</i>

832
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:03,241
<i>A fucking dead man.</i>

833
00:59:10,665 --> 00:59:12,755
Fuck you.

834
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:14,424
<i>You see?</i>

835
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,505
<i>You can't reason
with this maggot.</i>

836
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:19,470
<i>Put it down, Les.</i>

837
00:59:19,507 --> 00:59:22,260
<i>- You're gonna get hurt.
- Nooo!</i>

838
00:59:22,296 --> 00:59:25,852
No no!

839
00:59:25,888 --> 00:59:28,266
No!

840
01:00:08,598 --> 01:00:10,730
<i>Most people never stopto think</i>

841
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:13,352
<i>about the problems associated
with being a superhero.</i>

842
01:00:13,394 --> 01:00:15,651
<i>Instead they tend to
focus on</i>

843
01:00:15,688 --> 01:00:18,274
<i>the more glamorous aspects
of our lives.</i>

844
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,740
<i>They focus on
the powers we have,</i>

845
01:00:20,776 --> 01:00:23,195
<i>the things we can do
that no one else can.</i>

846
01:00:25,031 --> 01:00:26,913
<i>But the unfortunate
truth is that,</i>

847
01:00:26,949 --> 01:00:30,369
<i>while being different from
everyone can be exciting at first,</i>

848
01:00:30,406 --> 01:00:33,914
<i>Ultimately it can
get a little lonely.</i>

849
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:51,057
I'm sorry.

850
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:56,771
I just- I don't know
who to trust anymore.

851
01:00:56,807 --> 01:00:58,397
<i>I don't-</i>

852
01:01:06,238 --> 01:01:08,658
They couldn't have
gotten to you.

853
01:01:08,694 --> 01:01:11,077
They don't even know
I know you.

854
01:01:11,113 --> 01:01:13,496
I don't even know you.

855
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:21,087
What happ-

856
01:01:22,755 --> 01:01:25,800
happ- happened-

857
01:01:25,836 --> 01:01:28,844
to- to- to-

858
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,729
Shit.

859
01:01:33,766 --> 01:01:36,435
I'm sorry.
I sound-

860
01:01:36,472 --> 01:01:40,278
s- s- stupid.

861
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:42,900
I like the way
you sound.

862
01:01:44,652 --> 01:01:47,405
I do.

863
01:01:48,781 --> 01:01:51,659
Are you on drugs?

864
01:01:51,695 --> 01:01:53,762
Yeah.

865
01:01:53,798 --> 01:01:56,128
I am.

866
01:01:56,164 --> 01:01:58,421
Oh.

867
01:01:58,457 --> 01:02:01,127
What kind of drugs
did you take?

868
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:02,592
Pills.

869
01:02:02,628 --> 01:02:06,590
I took- I took
all my pills.

870
01:02:06,627 --> 01:02:08,777
You see?

871
01:02:08,813 --> 01:02:11,059
Yeah.

872
01:02:11,096 --> 01:02:13,269
Okay.

873
01:02:13,305 --> 01:02:16,392
Uh, we really need to-

874
01:02:18,728 --> 01:02:21,814
we really need to...

875
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:24,900
g- g-g-get you some help.

876
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:28,112
Tell me one thing,
please.

877
01:02:28,148 --> 01:02:30,870
What is it?

878
01:02:30,906 --> 01:02:33,242
Does this place
have a bathroom?

879
01:02:45,504 --> 01:02:48,632
I thought- I thought
I got rid of 'em all.

880
01:02:48,669 --> 01:02:50,640
The pills?

881
01:02:50,676 --> 01:02:52,391
Just-
no, the suits.

882
01:02:52,428 --> 01:02:55,765
The suits, they- they
wouldn't leave me alone.

883
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:57,868
They wouldn't,

884
01:02:57,904 --> 01:02:59,935
so I had to do it.

885
01:02:59,972 --> 01:03:02,188
I did.

886
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:09,361
D- d-did you
hurt someone?

887
01:03:09,403 --> 01:03:12,698
<i>Because that doesn't sound
like a very nice thing to do.</i>

888
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:15,618
- Ha-
- What's wrong?

889
01:03:15,654 --> 01:03:17,250
Nothing.

890
01:03:17,286 --> 01:03:20,289
I think there's-
there's a strong possibility

891
01:03:20,325 --> 01:03:22,684
that I'm losing my mind.

892
01:03:22,721 --> 01:03:25,044
I think
I'm losing my mind.

893
01:03:26,128 --> 01:03:28,464
<i>Come on, Les!</i>

894
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,799
<i>Can't you see me?</i>

895
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:32,927
<i>I'm standing right here.</i>

896
01:03:35,262 --> 01:03:36,972
Aren't you gonna
finish me off?

897
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:40,184
It- it's okay.

898
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,692
Shh.

899
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:45,278
Everything's gonna
be okay.

900
01:03:45,314 --> 01:03:48,692
Does this door lock
from the outside?

901
01:03:48,729 --> 01:03:50,783
Oh, I- I think so.

902
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:53,995
Can you- can you
lock me in here?

903
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:56,659
That doesn't sound like
a very good idea.

904
01:03:56,695 --> 01:03:58,845
Please, I'm not safe
to be around.

905
01:03:58,882 --> 01:04:00,996
You have to let me
take you to the-

906
01:04:02,665 --> 01:04:06,460
ho- ho-

907
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,172
to the E.R.

908
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:12,174
Please.

909
01:04:13,425 --> 01:04:14,927
Please.

910
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,805
Please.

911
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:22,017
You have to lock it
from out there.

912
01:04:22,054 --> 01:04:24,436
Uh, hold your horses.

913
01:04:39,785 --> 01:04:42,204
That- that should get you
through till morning.

914
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:49,925
Hey!

915
01:04:49,962 --> 01:04:52,965
You really do have
a beautiful voice.

916
01:04:58,304 --> 01:05:00,931
G- g-good night, Les.

917
01:05:35,007 --> 01:05:36,967
Goodbye, super-powers.

918
01:09:45,132 --> 01:09:47,676
<i>I suppose this will be
my last journal entry.</i>

919
01:09:47,712 --> 01:09:51,889
<i>I'm not looking forward to
returning to my old life.</i>

920
01:09:51,925 --> 01:09:54,576
<i>But the truth is,
with so many billions</i>

921
01:09:54,612 --> 01:09:57,191
<i>and billions of people
on the planet,</i>

922
01:09:57,227 --> 01:10:00,397
<i>most of us can't be unique or
important in any meaningful way.</i>

923
01:10:00,434 --> 01:10:03,734
<i>We go to sleep,
we wake up,</i>

924
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:06,200
<i>We go to work,
we eat,</i>

925
01:10:06,236 --> 01:10:08,369
<i>we spend time
with friends,</i>

926
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:11,825
<i>We watch TV,
maybe we even fall in love.</i>

927
01:10:13,202 --> 01:10:15,334
<i>But we don't have
any magical powers</i>

928
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:17,873
<i>and we don't have
any great battles to fight,</i>

929
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:21,423
<i>no evil forces
to defeat,</i>

930
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,546
<i>and no mysterious men
in suits chasing after us.</i>

931
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:27,132
<i>We just have reality.</i>

932
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:33,394
<i>And believing
anything else is just-</i>

933
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,683
<i>well, believing anything else
is just crazy, isn't it?</i>

934
01:11:30,278 --> 01:11:32,531
We better
get out of here.

935
01:11:36,034 --> 01:11:38,041
But he-

936
01:11:38,078 --> 01:11:40,622
We did what
we had to do.

937
01:11:45,627 --> 01:11:47,546
Come on.

938
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:30,482
Ted, what are
you doing?

939
01:13:30,518 --> 01:13:33,819
Ted!

940
01:14:15,193 --> 01:14:17,112
You can't make me stop.

941
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:31,042
You can't make me stop.

942
01:14:46,266 --> 01:14:47,851
You can't make me stop.
