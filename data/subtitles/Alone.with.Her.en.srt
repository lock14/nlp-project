1
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,100
Oh, my God, this is so cold!

2
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,100
What?

3
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,900
Get over here.

4
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,800
Go get it!

5
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,800
Come here, <i>perro</i>.
You wanna play some more?

6
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,900
Shit.

7
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,300
<i>Southland traffic, crash downtown L.A...</i>

8
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,900
- Good morning.
- <i>...east 101 at Coldwater...</i>

9
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
<i>I had to call,</i>
<i>because I'm experiencing the same thing,</i>

10
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,400
<i>and I could use your advice, bro...</i>

11
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,000
- <i>Can you blame her?</i>
- <i>No, I guess not.</i>

12
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,300
<i>You have to change the way you think.</i>
<i>If a woman sees that you're...</i>

13
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,600
Can I help you?

14
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Yeah, my wife and I
would like to, you know,

15
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,300
keep an eye on our nanny
while we're away from the house.

16
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Right, right.

17
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
We have all kinds of household objects
with built-in cameras.

18
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,000
Or you could do it yourself.

19
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,500
You can hide this one in anything--

20
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,200
you know, TV, clock-radio, VCR,
whatever.

21
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
How much is this?

22
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,700
This one goes for sixty-nine bucks,
and it comes with the receiver.

23
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:35,300
Hmm. Do-- do I--
do I need a license or something?

24
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,800
No, you're good to go.
It's totally legal.

25
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,500
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>It's hard. I mean--</i>

26
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,800
<i>Dan, you have to find out</i>
<i>what's important to her, okay?</i>

27
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,000
<i>I mean, you have to pay close attention</i>

28
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,500
<i>and really listen to what she says</i>
<i>with an open mind,</i>

29
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,500
<i>...some guys that actually</i>
<i>keep a small notebook handy,</i>

30
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,500
<i>and whenever they notice something</i>
<i>important to the girl...</i>

31
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
Beautiful.

32
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,100
Testing... testing.

33
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,000
Ahh.

34
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
No! Bad boy!

35
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,000
Bad boy! Ohh!

36
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,100
<i>¡Perro feo, eso no se hace!</i>

37
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,400
<i>Sólo que hay un tráfico terrible.</i>

38
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,900
Eso es Los Ángeles, ¿eh?

39
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,100
<i>Bueno.</i>

40
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,900
¿Ya trancaste las puertas?

41
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,500
- <i>Sí, mamá.</i>
- ¿Las dos?

42
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,500
<i>So, any sex with the ex?</i>

43
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
Shut up.

44
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,800
- <i>Did you see him?</i>
- No, thank God.

45
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,900
<i>Good. No drunk dialing either,</i>
<i>right?</i>

46
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,200
Yeah, Jen,

47
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,200
I got hammered with my parents
and snuck up to my room.

48
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,300
<i>I wouldn't put it past you.</i>

49
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,900
- Okay, I'm hanging up now.
- <i>No, no, don't.</i>

50
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,400
Mmm.

51
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,100
Me too. It was very, very powerful.

52
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,300
Yes, me too. Very powerful.

53
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,700
How did you like the wedding speech?

54
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,000
How did you like the wedding--

55
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,000
That's a great movie you have there.

56
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,800
I just saw it last night.

57
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,400
- Oh, me too.
- Really?

58
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,600
Yeah. It was very powerful.

59
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
God, tell me about it.

60
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,400
My eyes were so puffy by the end
that I looked like a boxer.

61
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,900
Cafe latte for Terrence.

62
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,600
How did you like
the wedding speech?

63
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,900
Oh, that was my favorite part.

64
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
- Big surprise.
- Totally.

65
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,700
Doug, double cappuccino.

66
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,200
- Well, uh, have a great day.
- You too.

67
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,000
Thanks.

68
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,000
- What do you think?
- I think you look really hot.

69
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,600
I don't like this, either.

70
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,300
Ohh, I just don't feel good.

71
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,700
Whatever. Guys love sad girls.
You're nice and vulnerable.

72
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Where's my boy?
Where is my boy?

73
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,900
Where's my boy?
Where's my boy...

74
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
Mmm...

75
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,400
Ohh... ohh...

76
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,600
Hey. How's it going?

77
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,300
Hi. Good. How are you?

78
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,700
Not too bad.

79
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,400
Seen any good movies lately?

80
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Uh, well, I-- I saw <i>Shampoo Village</i>
during the weekend.

81
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
That's so funny. Me too.

82
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,600
Oh. What did you think?

83
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,800
Oh...

84
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
- You?
- Same.

85
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,600
I felt like they were trying too hard.

86
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,500
That's exactly what I said.

87
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,600
And that whole road trip thing
just really didn't work for me.

88
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,900
It didn't work. I know.

89
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Next customer!

90
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,800
- Hello.
- Hi. Yes, can I please have

91
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,100
- a double tall cappuccino, please?
- Okay.

92
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,800
- And your name?
- Doug.

93
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,000
- Amy. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Amy.

94
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,800
So, what kind of music
are you into?

95
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Oh, uh, all kinds.

96
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,700
Basically whatever's on the radio,
whatever's popular.

97
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

98
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,200
- You?
- Same.

99
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,300
- Yeah?
- Yeah. A bit of everything. Totally.

100
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,800
There's this band that
I just discovered a few weeks ago,

101
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,200
they're really good.

102
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,900
They're kind of obscure.
They're called Skinny.

103
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,100
- Shut <i>up</i>!
- What?

104
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,300
- I love them!
- You do?

105
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Yeah! I have every one of their CDs.

106
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,600
- Huh. Really. Me too.
- That's so funny!

107
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,300
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I bought all mine
on the same day.

108
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,600
Holy shit!

109
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,300
Yeah, when I find a band
and they've got a lot of CDs

110
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,900
but I'm just finding out about 'em,

111
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,000
I just go and buy all the CDs
in one fell swoop, 'cause--

112
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,800
Doug, double cappuccino.

113
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,600
- That's you.
- Yeah.

114
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,900
- Uh-huh.
- Well, um, it was nice talking to you.

115
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,900
Yeah. I guess I'll see you around,
huh?

116
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,900
Yes. I can't wait to hear about
your taste in books.

117
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,400
Yeah.

118
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,800
- Bye.
- Take care.

119
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,000
So I met a guy
in the coffee shop today.

120
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,200
- <i>Was he cute?</i>
- I don't know. He's okay, I guess.

121
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,100
It's not like that. We just
had a lot in common,

122
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,000
like movies and music--
the exact same taste.

123
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,200
- <i>That's awesome.</i>
- And he loves that band Skinny.

124
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,000
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>Nobody knows about them.</i>

125
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,200
- Yeah.
- <i>So, do you like him?</i>

126
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,800
I hardly know him, Jen.

127
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,500
Seriously, I mean, I've talked to him
for like five minutes, total.

128
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,800
<i>Amy, swear to God. If you don't</i>
<i>give this a chance</i>

129
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,600
<i>I'm gonna kick your ass.</i>

130
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,100
Oh, shit.

131
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,900
- Hello?
- <i>What up, girl?</i>

132
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,400
- What?
- <i>I asked you first.</i>

133
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,500
- Who is this?
- <i>Ouch. That hurts.</i>

134
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,300
- Matt?
- <i>How's it goin', dude?</i>

135
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Who are you calling "dude"?

136
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,400
<i>So listen, unless you got a policy</i>
<i>against dating coworkers,</i>

137
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,300
<i>what do you say we go out</i>
<i>tomorrow night?</i>

138
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,400
<i>You know, a little dinner, movie,</i>
<i>candlelight...</i>

139
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,600
Well, I gotta say it's kinda short notice,
you know?

140
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,100
<i>Man, you're gonna make me squirm,</i>
<i>aren't ya?</i>

141
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
<i>Well, that's cool.</i>
<i>I'll just go stick my head in the oven.</i>

142
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,400
Well, I suppose I can
juggle a few things.

143
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,100
<i>No pressure.</i>

144
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,800
<i>So, what time does this</i>
<i>night of magic begin?</i>

145
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,800
<i>Let's see... pick you up at eight?</i>

146
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,300
<i>Sure.</i>

147
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,400
Hey.

148
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,300
What's up, dude?

149
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,300
So I'm a dude now, huh?

150
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,300
- No, I was just--
- What's up, dude? Ha ha!

151
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,400
- It's just an expression.
- I know. I'm sorry.

152
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,400
I'm just kidding. How's it going?

153
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,600
Good. Good.
Thank God it's Friday, huh?

154
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,900
Yeah, thank God.
What are you doing this weekend?

155
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,800
Well, tonight I thought we'd catch
our favorite band at Red Bar.

156
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,100
- What?
- Yeah, Skinny.

157
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
I just happen to have
an extra ticket to their show,

158
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,500
so, uh... you wanna come?

159
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,500
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

160
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,900
Yes, I was gonna go with my friend,
but he's sick,

161
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,600
and I know what a big fan you are,
so I thought you might like to go...

162
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,000
with me.

163
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,400
Oh, my God, Doug,
that's so sweet of you.

164
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,600
The show starts at ten,
so maybe we can grab some dinner first

165
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,300
or some drinks, or...

166
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,500
What?

167
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,800
I'm sorry, Doug, I can't go.

168
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,700
I made plans and there's
just no way I can break them.

169
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,100
Not even for Skinny?

170
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,400
It sucks, I know.

171
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,200
Well, they're only playing in town
for one night, so it--

172
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,700
It's a family thing.

173
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,000
They don't live here, and if I cancel,
they'd just kill me, you know?

174
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,800
I'm sorry.

175
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,500
It's okay.

176
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,500
- Any other night would be great.
- Yeah. Another night.

177
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,100
I know it's short notice,
I just thought, uh...

178
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,000
Well, I know someone else who would--
who would love to go, so...

179
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,400
don't worry about it.

180
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,300
- Really?
- Yeah. It's...

181
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
- You mean it?
- Yes. It's no big deal.

182
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,100
Don't-- look, I-- I better get goin'.
I have a meeting across town.

183
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Okay. I'm sorry. I won't keep you.

184
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,400
No, no. It's okay.

185
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,700
Okay.

186
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,500
- Have a great weekend.
- Yeah, you too.

187
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,900
Bye.

188
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,700
Augghh! Fuck!

189
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,200
Fuck! Fuck!

190
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,400
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, Matt.

191
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- It's Amy.

192
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
<i>Hey! You ready to rock?</i>

193
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,400
Oh, God--

194
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

195
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,000
I had to do it, Amy.

196
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,600
I'll make it better, I promise.

197
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,500
That's--

198
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,400
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

199
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,700
Thank you very much.

200
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,400
No, no, I-- I--
I can't ask you to do that.

201
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,300
No. Thank you. But--

202
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,900
Hey, stranger.

203
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,400
Hi, Amy. How are you?

204
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,100
Great. You?

205
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,400
- Well, I'm a bit nervous, actually.
- Why?

206
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,300
I called a cab twenty minutes ago,
but, uh...

207
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,000
What happened to your car?

208
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,400
I-- I don't know.

209
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,000
Oh-- be careful.

210
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,600
I don't know. I think the starter's broken.

211
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,800
I have a meeting in ten minutes
I can't miss, so I'm sorta...

212
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,100
Oh, geez.

213
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,800
Yeah.

214
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,100
You want a ride?

215
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,700
Oh-- no. No.
I-- I can't ask you to do that.

216
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,600
Well, you didn't ask. I offered.

217
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,200
Huh. Hmm.

218
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,400
- Where ya goin'?
- UCLA.

219
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,100
Well, that's right on my way.
Perfect. Seriously.

220
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,600
- Come on.
- Yeah?

221
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,900
- You're gonna be late.
- Okay, okay.

222
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,300
What are you studying?

223
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,300
Oh, no, I'm not a student.

224
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm a sales rep for
a small publishing house.

225
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,500
I go to colleges and push our textbooks.

226
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,100
- Cool.
- Well, I don't know about "cool."

227
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,400
It pays the bills
and the hours are good,

228
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,100
so it lets me do what I love
on the side.

229
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,300
- What's that?
- Photography.

230
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,300
Oh, cool. I mean it this time.
What kind of photography?

231
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,600
Mostly black and white landscapes.

232
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,000
Really. Would I have seen
any of your work?

233
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,800
No, no, I--

234
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,500
Fuck.

235
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

236
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,100
- Yeah.
- You sure you still want a ride?

237
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,800
Yeah-- yes, of course.
I think you're a great driver.

238
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,700
You know, I just put up a web site,
if you want to take a look.

239
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,700
Oh. I've been talking about
getting my own site for months.

240
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,200
- No, really?
- Yeah.

241
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,800
- For what?
- Painting.

242
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,300
- I paint on the side.
- Oh, wow.

243
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,500
I would be happy to do yours for you.
I'd only charge you a million bucks.

244
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,000
Nah.

245
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,900
No, I mean, it's the least I can do
after you saved my butt this morning.

246
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,900
All you need to do is
put your artwork on CD for me.

247
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Well, actually,
I've already done that.

248
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,900
Well, great. Then just give me the CD
and let me do the rest.

249
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,500
God, I mean, he's such a nice guy.

250
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,600
I just hope I'm not giving him
the wrong idea, you know?

251
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,900
<i>What does that mean?</i>

252
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I can't put my finger on it.

253
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,700
There's just something
a bit off about him.

254
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,400
<i>Well, look,</i>
<i>nobody's saying</i> marry <i>the guy.</i>

255
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
<i>Just have some fun, you know?</i>

256
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,800
<i>I mean, don't burn the bridge.</i>

257
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,100
<i>You don't know where</i>
<i>this thing with Matt is gonna go.</i>

258
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,700
<i>He could end up being, like...</i>
<i>really annoying.</i>

259
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,100
Oh, and thanks for
your message on Friday.

260
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,100
I really appreciate it, you know.

261
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,400
<i>Well, I think you're</i>
<i>an amazing artist.</i>

262
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,300
- Oh, stop it.
- <i>As a matter of fact,</i>

263
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,200
<i>I've got something I want to show you.</i>

264
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,900
- Hey.
- Hi.

265
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
Come on in.

266
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,700
Oh, hey. Oh! Hi!

267
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,400
What a-- wow, what a cool place.

268
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,300
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

269
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,600
- Whoa.
- Oh, sorry about that.

270
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,700
- Rocky, go to your bed.
- No, it's okay, I love dogs.

271
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,700
- Hey.
- Can I take your jacket?

272
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,300
No, I'm fine, thank you. I'm okay.

273
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

274
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,100
- So do you.
- Yeah, right.

275
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,600
Can I get you a drink?

276
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,400
Oh, uh, yeah, sure.
Just whatever you're having.

277
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,800
- It's like he knows you.
- Yeah.

278
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,200
Are you hiding a steak
in your pocket, or what?

279
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,800
Ha. No, no, nothin' like that.

280
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,400
Oh, my God.

281
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,900
I wanted to try and use
the same sort of tone as your paintings,

282
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,600
the same conceptual design,
and your color scheme...

283
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,100
It's just perfect, you know?
Absolutely perfect.

284
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,700
You see this little flash animation thing?

285
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,000
I don't know what to say.
I mean...

286
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,300
thank you.

287
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,400
- Thank you so much.
- No, it's my pleasure.

288
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,600
Um...

289
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,600
there's no way I'm paying you
fifty bucks for <i>this</i>. I mean...

290
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,100
Well, yeah, that's right, you're--
you're not gonna pay me anything.

291
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,700
- Doug.
- What?

292
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,400
Seriously.

293
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,000
I-- I'm serious. I really enjoyed doing it.

294
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,300
Good, I'm glad. But no way.
You're taking at least two hundred.

295
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,500
- No. No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

296
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,900
I would have paid ten times more
anywhere else.

297
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,500
I don't wanna take advantage.

298
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,800
You're not taking advantage.

299
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,800
Look, if-- if you wanna
take me out to dinner,

300
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,500
we can call it even.

301
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,300
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

302
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,600
- Have you been waiting long?
- No, no.

303
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,300
My best friend that I grew up with
was already living here, so...

304
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,400
- Made it easier.
- Of course. Much easier.

305
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,200
Yeah. How about you?
Did you move here with friends, or...?

306
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,500
No. Actually it was work
that brought me down here.

307
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,600
My family and friends
are all still in Seattle.

308
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Hmm.

309
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,600
It took a lot of courage
to do that, huh?

310
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,700
The truth is, I kind of wanted
to make a fresh start for myself.

311
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,700
I just got out of a serious relationship,
so

312
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
Oh.

313
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,800
Um...

314
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,200
...me too.

315
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,400
Really?

316
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,000
Yeah, it was right after college.
It was like...

317
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,500
Let's not go there.

318
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,100
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-- to--

319
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,100
No, no, it's fine.
Uh, I just wanted a sip, you know.

320
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,300
- It's just-- I was just trying to--
- It's totally fine.

321
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,100
It's funny, huh? I mean, scary.

322
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,000
- What?
- How much we have in common.

323
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

324
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,400
I know.

325
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,500
We're sitting in a restaurant
and the whole Mike thing came up, and...

326
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,500
What? Why would you bring that up?

327
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,900
- I didn't. He did.
- He brought up Mike?

328
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,800
He was talking about
why he moved here

329
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,600
and how he had just
got out of a relationship,

330
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,900
and I just said I did, too.

331
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,500
See, Ames,
there's so no reason to go there.

332
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,200
Can you help me find my fucking shoe?

333
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,100
The point is that he reached over
and he held my hand,

334
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,000
but it was all sweaty and <i>gross</i>.

335
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,400
- Fine. Then just blow him off.
- No, I don't want to hurt him.

336
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,900
It's just, things are good
with Matt right now.

337
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,100
Here's your shoe.

338
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
I'm just gonna slow it down.

339
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,800
Tell him I'm busy
whenever he wants to do something.

340
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,100
<i>...high of 84, winds northwest</i>
<i>at 5 to 10 miles per hour.</i>

341
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,100
<i>Tonight, generally clear skies</i>
<i>with a few...</i>

342
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,100
My fuckin' laptop was stolen
along with all my work stuff.

343
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,800
<i>You're kidding me! How?</i>

344
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,500
Well, I left it in the car,
I went to get a coffee,

345
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,300
and when I came out it was gone.

346
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,000
<i>Oh, my God. Ames.</i>

347
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,000
Twelve loan applications
with social security numbers,

348
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,600
- home addresses...
- <i>You didn't lock your car?</i>

349
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,600
I did. I <i>thought</i> I did.

350
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,400
So fucking stupid.

351
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,000
<i>Oh, shit, Ames, I wish I could</i>
<i>leave right now. I'm sorry I can't.</i>

352
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,300
God, it was so humiliating.

353
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,200
They had the security guard walk me out
in front of the whole company.

354
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it goin'?

355
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,800
Good. Come on in.

356
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,900
Come here, Rocky.

357
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,700
- Oh! Oh!
- Poor guy.

358
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,500
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

359
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm fine.

360
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,900
Seriously, I'm okay.

361
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,700
- You sure?
- Yeah.

362
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,300
- You want a drink?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

363
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,100
You ever thought about
doing your art full-time?

364
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,500
Yeah, but, um,
I don't think I can.

365
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,900
Not yet, anyway.

366
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Amy, trust me.
You can make a living at it.

367
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,300
You think so?

368
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,700
No.

369
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,100
Uh!

370
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,000
I mean it. I'm serious.

371
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,300
Mm-hm. You're bad.

372
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,300
I know.

373
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,200
I'm sorry...

374
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,100
I can't.

375
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,100
I'm so sorry. I just--

376
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,500
I can't right now.
It's just too fast.

377
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,900
That's okay.

378
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,500
My bad.

379
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,600
What did he say?

380
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Nothing, but...

381
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,800
he was practically limping
out the door.

382
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,200
What, with his big blue balls
rollin' behind him?

383
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,100
Come on, let's go.

384
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,300
Cocktails await the cock tease.

385
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm kidding.

386
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,000
Come <i>on</i>. let's go.
Don't make me kick you.

387
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,600
Ohh...

388
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,000
Ow.

389
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,400
Ohh...

390
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,700
Ay, fuck!

391
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
<i>No sé. Yo creo que fue algo</i>
<i>que me dio alergia.</i>

392
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,000
- Dios mío.
- <i>Es que me arde mucho la piel.</i>

393
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,900
Mija, quiero que vayas al doctor
ahora mismo.

394
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,800
<i>Espérame. Espérame.</i>

395
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,200
Fuck.

396
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,000
<i>I don't think you want to be seen</i>

397
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,300
in public with me right now.

398
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,500
<i>Shit.</i>
<i>We can't catch a break, huh?</i>

399
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah, I'm sorry. I know it's been
one thing after another.

400
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,900
<i>Hey, don't worry about it.</i>
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

401
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,800
Maybe you want to come over
and we can watch a movie or something?

402
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,400
I promise I'll sit across the room.

403
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,600
<i>You know, I-- I think I'm gonna</i>
<i>catch up on some work tonight.</i>

404
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,800
<i>Yeah, you know, I've been</i>
<i>dragging my ass on it for too long,</i>

405
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,500
<i>got a shitload of stuff.</i>

406
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,000
Um, okay.

407
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,700
Maybe next week or something, huh?

408
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,100
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.</i>

409
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,800
Okay.

410
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,600
<i>Yeah. Feel better.</i>

411
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,200
- Bye-bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

412
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,000
<i>Ay!</i>

413
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,000
Fuck!

414
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,800
<i>¿Por qué me pasa a mí esto,</i>
<i>carajo?</i>

415
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,300
Oh, no.

416
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,000
Oh, my God.

417
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Oh, my-- I'm sorry.

418
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,800
No, I'm sorry.

419
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,100
I think it's pretty much over.

420
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,200
Don't say that.

421
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,000
Can't blame him, really.

422
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,500
He must think
I'm a total pain in the ass.

423
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,300
God, Ames...

424
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,200
It's a friggin' patch of bad luck.

425
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,100
If he can't see that, then...
to hell with him. Seriously.

426
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,900
He's not worth it.

427
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,600
Have you heard from Doug at all?

428
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,300
I just hope he's not mad at me.

429
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,100
I'm sure he's fine.
Why would he be mad?

430
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,800
You should call him, you know?

431
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,600
Just to touch base.

432
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,500
- Hello.
- <i>Hi. Amy Ruis, please.</i>

433
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,800
Speaking.

434
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,300
<i>Amy, it's Todd Siegel calling</i>
<i>from Griffin Cafe in Brentwood.</i>

435
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,400
<i>I'm calling about your artwork.</i>
<i>Do you have a few moments?</i>

436
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
<i>Well, in short,</i>
<i>we're a five-star restaurant,</i>

437
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,000
<i>and for décor we display the work</i>
<i>of promising local artists.</i>

438
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,100
<i>What do you think about dropping by</i>
<i>this afternoon so we can talk?</i>

439
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,700
I think-- yeah. I mean, thank you.
This is great.

440
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,200
<i>No, no, thank</i> you<i>. And please</i>
<i>give our thanks to your friend again.</i>

441
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Sorry?

442
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,100
Hi, Rocky.

443
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,500
I thought you said you had
a bag over your head.

444
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,800
Well, this is the best I could do.

445
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,000
Well, uh...

446
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,900
you don't look so bad.

447
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,500
Because you can't see it.

448
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,200
No, no, I'm serious.
Here, I got you something.

449
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,700
Oh, you're <i>good</i>.

450
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,100
No, honestly, total fluke.

451
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,000
I had a lunch meeting there today,

452
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,000
and I took a look at
the pieces they had on the wall,

453
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,400
and I thought of you.

454
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,300
Because the pieces were good,

455
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,200
but they weren't anywhere
as good as yours.

456
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,200
- Oh, stop it.
- So anyways,

457
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,100
I thought that there would be
no harm in asking what it would take

458
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,400
- to get your work up there.
- No, none at all.

459
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,300
And the manager said, "Just talent,"
so I pointed him to your web site

460
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,800
and here we are.

461
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,900
Unbelievable.

462
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,500
Listen, my friend Jen's coming over
tonight with some Thai food,

463
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,200
just a little celebration dinner.

464
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,400
You want to join us?

465
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,000
Oh. Uh, I'd love to,
but I have to take a rain check.

466
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,200
Oh.

467
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,800
I'm sorry, but I promised this girl Kathy
I'd meet her in Long Beach tonight.

468
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,100
Hmm. Who's Kathy?

469
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,900
Girlfriend?

470
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,700
Well, I mean,
I don't know about "girlfriend."

471
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,100
They just started seeing each other.

472
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,300
Really.

473
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,500
Yeah. Kind of a blow to the ego.

474
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,000
Why? What do you care?
You guys are just friends, right?

475
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,800
You are so busted.

476
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,500
Yeah, Jen, I'm burning with jealousy.

477
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,700
Admit it, you want a poke
from that big butt worm.

478
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,200
Fuck off.

479
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,600
Seriously, though,
I need your help tomorrow.

480
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,400
He's coming here for lunch
and I want you to be here.

481
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
Why?

482
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,200
Just to be safe.

483
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,800
I mean, it's great
that he's moved on,

484
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,100
I just don't want to
encourage him again.

485
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,200
It's just, he's got no confidence,
you know?

486
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,500
Ohh! Ohh!

487
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,400
Fuck!

488
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,600
Fuck.

489
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,800
Fuck. Fuck.

490
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,500
<i>Hey, it's Doug.</i>

491
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,900
<i>I'm sorry, did I call too late?</i>

492
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Shit.

493
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,900
It's open.

494
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,800
Hey, it's me.

495
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,600
Oh, God, are you okay?

496
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,600
I think I'm gonna need
a few stitches.

497
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,200
Oh, geez, okay. Um...

498
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,800
Can you let Rocky outside?
I don't want him to get hurt.

499
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,200
Yeah. Yeah. Come on.

500
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,700
Okay. Um... okay. Wow.

501
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,400
Uh, well, let's get you a rag. Let's--

502
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,300
Let me just tie it.

503
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,100
- There. Okay?
- Uh-huh.

504
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,600
Let's get you to the hospital.
Can you stand?

505
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,300
Yeah.

506
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,800
- Oh, shit. No, no, no, no.
- Okay. Okay.

507
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,500
Here. Tell you what. Here.

508
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,900
I'm sorry about this.

509
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,600
It's okay. I'm stronger than I look.

510
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,200
I'll let him in.

511
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,700
The shelf in the kitchen fell
when I was out.

512
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,200
The one with all the glasses on it.

513
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,400
I stepped right into
a pile of broken glass.

514
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,200
I couldn't see anything.
The damn light was off.

515
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,300
He stayed with me
through the whole thing.

516
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,100
Even the stitches.
He's such a sweetheart.

517
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,500
Thank you so much.

518
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
I know I keep saying that, but...

519
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,700
Are you gonna be okay for tomorrow?
I mean, with Rocky...

520
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,500
Yeah. Jen's coming over
before work, so...

521
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,900
You've done enough. Seriously.

522
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,500
Uh--

523
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,800
At least somebody's
having a good night, huh?

524
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,900
Yeah.

525
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,900
Oh. Yeah.

526
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,400
So, are we still on for lunch tomorrow?

527
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,300
Yeah. Yeah.

528
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,700
Yeah, absolutely.

529
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,300
- Well, I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.

530
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,200
- All right. See you tomorrow.
- See ya.

531
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,400
When I think about
everything he's done for me,

532
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,200
it just blows my mind.

533
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,200
No shit.

534
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,200
I'm starting to feel like
a second fiddle around here.

535
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,600
Well, you can tell him
who's the boss at lunch.

536
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,000
- Oh, crap.
- What?

537
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,500
I can't do it today.
I have this fucking meeting.

538
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,700
I'm so sorry. I totally forgot.

539
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,600
That's okay. No worries.

540
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,600
Well, I mean, do you want to
call him and reschedule?

541
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,400
No. I can handle it.

542
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,000
What?

543
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,700
Nothing.

544
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,700
He's got a girlfriend.

545
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Yeah, we'll see how long that lasts.

546
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,900
Shit.

547
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,000
Be a good boy.

548
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,500
- Hey, come on in.
- Hi.

549
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,300
- Did you hear?
- No.

550
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,700
They sold my paintings!
All three of them!

551
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,800
You're kidding! Congratulations!
That is great!

552
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,500
- I know!
- When did this happen?

553
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,800
Today. And they want three more.

554
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,500
- So, do you know who bought them?
- No, they didn't say.

555
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,100
Well, not that it matters.

556
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,200
I don't think they tell you anyway,
do they?

557
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,500
I don't know. I mean, I guess not.
It's probably a privacy thing.

558
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,200
But whoever it was,
they got good taste, huh?

559
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,000
God, I am so happy for you. God.

560
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,100
Listen, get ready,

561
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,000
'cause I have a feeling that this is
probably gonna be your new job.

562
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,200
Imagine. What a dream, huh?

563
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,600
- Champagne, anyone?
- Hey!

564
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,500
- Hi! Don't get up. Don't get up.
- You made it.

565
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,500
Oh...

566
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,200
- I thought you had a meeting.
- Do you think I would miss this?

567
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,200
- No.
- Congratulations, sweetie.

568
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,500
- I got you a little something.
- Thank you. It's all him.

569
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,500
What'd you get her?

570
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,200
I'm just kidding. Hi, I'm Jen.

571
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,200
Hi, I'm Doug. It's nice to meet you.

572
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,700
Yeah. I was beginning to think
you were avoiding me.

573
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,400
- No, not at all. Why--
- She's kidding, Doug.

574
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,600
Yeah, I'm just kidding, honey.

575
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,900
- Chill.
- Oh. Ha ha.

576
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,800
- Who wants to get wasted?
- I do.

577
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,400
- I do too!
- Uh, I'll have a glass.

578
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,300
I have been telling her for ages
to get out there and sell her work,

579
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,300
- but does she listen to <i>me</i>? No.
- Would you give it a rest?

580
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,600
I'm just saying, you know?

581
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,300
Well, don't listen to her.
I've done a few shows.

582
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,400
I'm not talking about
a few little shows.

583
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,000
I'm talking about really getting out there
and selling the shit out of yourself.

584
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,000
Well, some people aren't
natural assholes like you.

585
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Do you want a little more champagne?

586
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,800
- No! Doug, help me!
- Oh, fuck!

587
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,200
Shit, dude, um, sorry.

588
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,000
- Here. Here.
- Thank you.

589
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,100
No, it'll-- it'll be fine.

590
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,200
- Jen.
- No, it's okay, really.

591
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,700
- It shouldn't stain.
- It's okay.

592
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,600
It's okay. It's all right.

593
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,400
Do you want some more champagne?

594
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,600
You're not from San Diego,
though, right?

595
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,200
- He's from Seattle. I told you.
- Oh, that's right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

596
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,100
I forgot. What part?

597
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,700
Uh, Beacon Hill.

598
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,200
Oh, very cool.

599
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:51,000
I mean, I don't really know Seattle,
but my cousin Mark is from there.

600
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,000
You, um, you have family still there?

601
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,200
Uh, yeah, uh, well, my parents,

602
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,400
but my dad's recently retired

603
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,800
and so him and my mother
are, uh, traveling through Europe.

604
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,400
- Hmm. Where?
- Retired from what?

605
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,600
Uh, medicine. He's an eye doctor.

606
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,100
Very cool.

607
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,600
I'll see if my cousin Mark knows him.

608
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,000
I don't know, but...

609
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,200
You know, the last time I was there
he took me to

610
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,400
this really great fashion district
called Ridgewood.

611
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,800
- Have you ever been there?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

612
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,300
- Do you mind if I use your restroom?
- No, not at all.

613
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,000
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

614
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,200
There's no Ridgewood in Seattle.
I completely made that up.

615
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,900
- Don't say anything right now, okay?
- Why not?

616
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,900
Because I don't want to
put him on the spot like that.

617
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,100
We don't know what's going on.
I'm sure there's a good reason for it.

618
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,800
- You could just ask him.
- I will, but not with you here.

619
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,500
Fuck. Fuck.

620
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,800
Hello?

621
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,900
This is him.

622
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,800
What? No, I-- I faxed that to him
on Monday.

623
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,200
Okay, well, you're gonna have to
give me an extra twenty minutes

624
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,500
because I'm on the West Side.

625
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,700
Okay, yes. Yes. Tell him
he will have it by two o'clock.

626
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,000
Okay. Yes. Thank you, Beth.
Good-bye.

627
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,500
- You have to go?
- Yes, I'm so sorry.

628
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,100
- So soon?
- Yeah, there's a mix-up at work,

629
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,900
- so I gotta go now. Sorry.
- Thanks for coming.

630
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,200
It's my pleasure.
Congratulations again.

631
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,000
- Thank you for everything.
- I'm so happy for you.

632
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,100
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, likewise.

633
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,800
<i>I really liked her. I can see</i>
<i>why you guys are best friends.</i>

634
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,800
Yeah, she's great. I mean, um,
she really liked you too, you know?

635
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,100
<i>She likes to ask a lot of questions,</i>
<i>doesn't she?</i>

636
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,400
She doesn't mean anything by it,
I swear.

637
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,400
<i>No, no-- I'm sure she doesn't, but--</i>

638
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,600
<i>by the way, she mentioned something</i>
<i>about Seattle,</i>

639
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,900
<i>like a, uh, shopping district</i>
<i>or something...</i>

640
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,900
- Yeah.
- <i>I can't remember.</i>

641
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,200
<i>I think it was called Bridgewood</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

642
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,400
Yeah, I think so.

643
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,600
<i>Anyways, um, I may have said</i>
<i>that I've heard of it,</i>

644
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,500
<i>and I-- I know that this is wrong,</i>
<i>but to be honest,</i>

645
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,700
<i>I-- I've never heard of it.</i>

646
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,300
<i>It's just that she was</i>
<i>asking so many questions</i>

647
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,000
<i>and I had to go to the bathroom,</i>
<i>and I didn't want to be rude, but--</i>

648
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:08,000
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes she's a real jerk, you know?

649
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,500
And you buy that?

650
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,000
Why wouldn't I?
You were totally grilling him.

651
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,900
Oh, God.

652
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,200
Just put this to bed, all right?

653
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,800
Seriously. It's so stupid.

654
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,700
Well, whatever.

655
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,500
You push me to go out with the guy
and give him a chance and--

656
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,900
Amy, I'm just saying, you know,
you're kind of fucked up right now

657
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,500
and you're not seeing clearly.

658
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,200
I mean, yeah, he's doing
all these nice--

659
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,200
What, Ames? Come on,
I'm just trying to watch your back.

660
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,400
You're trying to watch <i>your</i> back.

661
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,600
- You should just do whatever you want.
- I will.

662
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,500
- Okay, good.
- I'm not a fucking child, you know?

663
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,500
When did I ever say
you were a fucking child?

664
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,600
While you've been working, he's been saving my
ass every fucking day.

665
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,900
You know what? Forget it.
Forget it.

666
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,400
Just give him a fucking chance.
Please.

667
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,000
Seattle, please.

668
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,100
Mark Fowles on Baxter Drive.

669
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:38,100
Hey, hey, Mark, it's Jen.
What do you say, cuz?

670
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:42,700
Um, listen, can you call me
at home tonight?

671
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,200
I need you to track down this doctor
that used to work in Beacon Hill.

672
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,700
He's gone. Rocky's gone.
He's not on the patio.

673
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,800
- Was the gate open?
- I mean, <i>obviously</i>.

674
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,100
Fuck, Jen, did you check
outside the gate?

675
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah, <i>Amy</i>, he's not there.

676
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,300
He's probably next door
or down the street at the park.

677
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,400
All right, I'll go look.
Just stay there. Just stay there.

678
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,300
Rocky!

679
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,700
Rocky!

680
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,000
Come on, Rocky!

681
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,800
Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you.

682
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,600
What are you doing here?

683
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,100
I just spoke with Amy. I thought
I'd come out here and help you look.

684
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,400
No luck so far, huh?

685
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,800
No, but I'll be fine, thanks, okay?

686
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,600
Hey, look, maybe we should
just split up, okay?

687
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,800
You don't like me very much,
do you?

688
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,400
I don't even know you.

689
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,500
I mean, I know you're not
from Seattle, but...

690
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,500
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Just forget it.

691
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,300
Hey, how are you?

692
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,500
Oh. I can't talk right now.

693
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,900
What's wrong?

694
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,400
Amy, what--

695
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,400
Amy, what happened?
Talk to me.

696
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,300
What happened?

697
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,600
Jen's dead.

698
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:15,000
She fell down the stairs.
It was so dark.

699
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,100
What stairs?

700
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,000
At the park.

701
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,400
She was looking for Rocky,
and...

702
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,500
it was so wet and dark...

703
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,000
She must have slipped.

704
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,900
I couldn't go with her.

705
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,000
I couldn't go. I couldn't walk.

706
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,900
<i>I'm gonna stay at my parents</i>
<i>for a few more days.</i>

707
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,100
<i>Okay, I understand.</i>
<i>Come back when you feel ready.</i>

708
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,400
<i>Look, I want you to know that</i>
<i>I'm still looking for Rocky.</i>

709
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,600
<i>Thank you, Doug.</i>

710
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,000
Do you want some more?

711
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,600
I think I'm gonna go home now, okay?

712
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,800
How's Kathy?

713
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,200
Better, I'm sure, since this morning.

714
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,800
What do you mean?

715
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,200
She ended it.

716
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,200
Oh. I'm sorry.

717
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,000
It's for the best.

718
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,200
I haven't exactly been giving her
a lot of attention lately.

719
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,400
I know. I'm sorry.

720
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,500
No-- hey, no. Don't say that, all right?
It wasn't working out.

721
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,400
Hey. I mean that, Amy.
Okay?

722
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,300
Now, you're gonna call me
if you need anything, right?

723
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,500
I'll see you tomorrow.

724
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,500
You're the best friend I have.

725
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,200
- Look who's home.
- Oh, my God!

726
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,000
Oh, my God! Rocky!

727
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,400
Oh, my baby! Ooh, look at you!

728
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,900
Mmm...

729
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,600
So every night I've been
pretty much going around

730
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,100
the same sections of the neighborhood
callin' out his name, tryin' to find him.

731
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,700
And I'm sorta finishing my round,

732
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,700
and I figure that I should
check out that alley one last time.

733
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,500
So I go up to the alley
and I yell out Rocky's name,

734
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,100
- and then I hear this bark.
- Oh, my God.

735
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,600
So I run down the alley,
and there he is.

736
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,700
- That's-- that's it.
- Holy shit.

737
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,800
Okay, okay, hold on already.

738
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,200
- I'm just gonna get a water.
- Yeah, sure.

739
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,200
You're not running away
this time, boy.

740
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,100
Hey.

741
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,600
Is something the matter?

742
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,000
It's okay, Doug.

743
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,300
Fuck!

744
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,000
It's all right.

745
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,700
I shouldn't have done this.

746
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,400
- No, Doug.
- I can do it. I can do it.

747
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,100
- No.
- I can do it!

748
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,000
It's not that.

749
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,700
Please. Don't!

750
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,300
Get <i>off</i>!

751
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,500
I'm sorry.

752
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,200
I can't do this. It's just not right.

753
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,100
We made a big mistake.

754
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,600
- I'm sorry.
- How can you say that?

755
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,600
It's not a mistake.
How can you say that?

756
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,600
I don't want to hurt you.
I care about you a lot.

757
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,500
Why? What do you have
to go back to?

758
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,800
I know that you're alone,
and I-- I know that.

759
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,500
And I know that you're hurting.

760
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,400
We don't <i>have</i> to be alone. I--

761
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,400
- I think you should go home.
- No.

762
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,400
No, let's just-- let's just talk about this.

763
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,000
- I need you to leave.
- I have done <i>everything</i> for you.

764
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:43,300
When you-- when you lost your job,
when you hurt yourself,

765
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,200
when you had <i>nothing</i>,
I took care of you.

766
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,700
- I know you did.
- But you want to go back. To what?

767
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,400
Huh? To being alone?
To this empty room? To that brush?

768
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,500
Don't you get it?
I am here for you! I'm--

769
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,500
What the fuck are you talking about?

770
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,700
I love you!

771
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,900
You said "brush." My <i>brush</i>.

772
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:09,300
What the fuck did you mean by that?

773
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,200
How did you know that?

774
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,300
There's no way you could--

775
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:28,800
Oh, my God.

776
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,500
Fuck!

777
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,700
Fuck.

778
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,200
Let me out.

779
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,000
No, no, no, no, no.
I need to explain--

780
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,800
- Get out of my fucking way!
- I need to ex--

781
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,400
No! No! No! No!

782
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,000
Amy! Amy!

783
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,300
- Fuck!
- Let me in!

784
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,900
Amy!

785
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,200
Let me in!

786
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:36,900
Amy!

787
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,800
I don't want to--
I don't want to hurt you!

788
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,200
Just listen. I want you to listen.

789
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,400
I just wanted you to listen.

790
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,400
Please, Doug.
You have to let me out of here.

791
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,400
- I can't breathe.
- Shh. Just listen.

792
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,200
Just listen to me.

793
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,700
No...

794
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,300
When I saw you...

795
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,200
at that park, the first time...

796
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,100
you looked so much like--

797
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,200
--you looked so much like
someone I knew.

798
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,300
But-- but-- but different.

799
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,100
She was so cruel to me, Amy.

800
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,100
And I love her.
And-- and when she--

801
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,700
--when she didn't, I...

802
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
...I wanted to die.

803
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,400
I wanted to die. You see?

804
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,400
Oh, God.

805
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:45,100
But not anymore.
Not anymore.

806
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,700
Because of you.

807
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,700
When I first saw you
you looked exactly how I felt.

808
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,500
And I couldn't stop thinking about you.

809
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,000
And I wanted to talk to you,
but...

810
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,300
I just wanted you to give me a chance.

811
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,100
I just wanted you to look at me
and know that we are the same.

812
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,600
Look...

813
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,900
I'll take 'em down.

814
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,100
I'll take them all down,
Amy, I promise,

815
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,500
just please don't push me away.

816
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,100
I'm not gonna push you away, Doug.

817
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,500
I mean it.

818
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,200
- You really scared me, you know?
- I know. I know.

819
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,300
And I'm-- I'm so sorry.

820
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,600
I know you are.

821
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,900
And I know how hard it is.

822
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,400
When I moved here...

823
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:56,500
sometimes I felt like... I was dying,

824
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:02,000
like... I'd give anything
to not feel so alone.

825
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,100
I understand. I do.

826
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:10,200
I mean... I don't like what you did,
but...

827
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,000
but I understand.

828
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,700
In a way, I'm glad.

829
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:24,300
I feel like I'm really seeing you
for the first time.

830
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,800
Can you do something for me?

831
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,500
I want to know <i>you</i> more.

832
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:39,400
I want to know as much about you
as you know about me.

833
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,900
So come on.

834
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,400
I'm gonna get us some tea
and we're gonna talk, all right?

835
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,100
Hmm?

836
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,100
Come on.

837
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,400
Don't.

838
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,300
Hey, what's the matter, Doug?

839
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,700
We're just going to the kitchen.

840
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,900
I'm not gonna do anything.

841
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,800
We're just gonna talk, all right?

842
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,300
Let me out of here, all right?

843
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,100
Let me out!

844
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,700
<i>¡Te odio! ¡Púdrete en el infierno!</i>

845
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,100
Fucking cunt!

846
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,600
Ohh! Ohh!

847
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,100
