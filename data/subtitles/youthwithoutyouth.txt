1
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:48,752
<i>Sometimes I admit to
myself that it's possible</i>

2
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:51,987
<i>I will never be able
to finish my life's work.</i>

3
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:58,027
<i>My one and only book.</i>

4
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:03,400
<i>And that in the end,
without her...</i>

5
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:12,376
<i>...there will be nothing.</i>

6
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:14,411
<i>And I will die alone.</i>

7
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:33,097
<i>What are you doing here,
Coane Dominic?</i>

8
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,601
I have a migraine.

9
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:40,270
I thought a walk might help.

10
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:43,040
But in your pajamas
on Christmas Eve?

11
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,910
Don't catch cold. Look.

12
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:50,081
At the first opportunity,
I'll...

13
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:55,086
What do you do
at the first opportunity?

14
00:02:57,023 --> 00:03:00,292
At the first
opportunity, I have to- I have-

15
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:02,089
It's in the drawer.

16
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:05,164
I- I have saved-
I saved it for-

17
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:09,368
At the first opportunity,
I will open the blue envelope.

18
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:14,740
Not here in Piatra Neamt
where everyone knows me,

19
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,210
but somewhere far away.

20
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,748
Bucharest perhaps.

21
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,117
At Easter.

22
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,305
<i>Universal.</i>

23
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:54,111
<i>Universal.</i>

24
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:08,023
<i>Special Easter
edition. Universal.</i>

25
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:10,660
War clouds over Romania.

26
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,462
Oh, it's pouring.

27
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,643
<i>Universal.</i>

28
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:42,058
He was struck by lightning.

29
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:43,427
Call an ambulance.

30
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,798
Call for some help.

31
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:50,333
Look, who knows
what sins he has committed

32
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,036
that God would strike him
on Easter.

33
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:57,775
They say whoever dies during
Easter goes straight to heaven.

34
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:06,284
<i>Dominic.</i>

35
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:14,525
Oh...

36
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:18,262
<i>I will wish you.
You know what I mean. I mean...</i>

37
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:23,266
<i>I will love you
until the day I die.</i>

38
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:38,216
The eye seems intact,

39
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:42,487
but I don't know
if he is blind or not.

40
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:45,155
I don't even know
if he's conscious,

41
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:51,130
if he hears or
if he understands what he hears.

42
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:57,070
If you understand what I say,
squeeze my finger.

43
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:11,785
I'm Dr. Roman Stanciulescu.

44
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:14,518
I'm here to help you.

45
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,925
Good.

46
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:21,361
We wish to find out
your age.

47
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:25,932
For every 10 years,
squeeze my finger once.

48
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:31,338
Ten.

49
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:36,244
Twenty.
Twenty.

50
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,013
Thirty.

51
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:43,316
Forty.
Forty.

52
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:46,087
Fifty.
Fifty.

53
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:49,824
Sixty.
Sixty.

54
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,829
Seventy.
Seventy.

55
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:57,898
Seventy years old.

56
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:03,305
Seventy. I would
have thought less.

57
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:08,076
Well, in this larval state,

58
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,180
it's hard to estimate.

59
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:28,062
<i>I've never
met anyone like you.</i>

60
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:31,500
<i>You want to know
absolutely everything.</i>

61
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,965
Laura, try to imagine

62
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:36,805
conceiving a passion
for something,

63
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:39,275
having one desire,
dedicating your life to it

64
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:40,944
and then failing.

65
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:42,111
I am 26.

66
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:44,128
I have no accomplishments,

67
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:46,146
I've made no discoveries.

68
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:47,752
I'm a failure.

69
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:49,985
Do you have a wife?

70
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:52,687
No.
- No.

71
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,525
Nephew?

72
00:08:57,228 --> 00:08:59,228
Yes.
- Nephew.

73
00:08:59,229 --> 00:09:00,629
Nephew.
- Do you want us

74
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,601
to inform your nephew
about your condition?

75
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,702
No.

76
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:09,874
Let us know the first letter
of your name. Continue.

77
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,208
I am going to say
the alphabet.

78
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:18,784
A, B, C, D...

79
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:20,551
D.
- D.

80
00:09:20,552 --> 00:09:24,486
He doesn't live
in Bucharest.

81
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:28,659
He has only one relative,
a distant one,

82
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,428
and he has no wife.

83
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:32,896
Thank you.

84
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:39,769
He'll accept any test,

85
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:42,904
no matter how dangerous
or painful,

86
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:46,910
to verify whether
the optic nerve was damaged.

87
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:51,416
That's interesting.

88
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:06,633
How old did you say he was?

89
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:08,033
Seventy.

90
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,765
He's hiding his age.

91
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:13,071
He's a young man
in the prime of his life.

92
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,247
I didn't come here...

93
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:22,683
I came here for an education.
- Come.

94
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,852
What did you think
about the lecture?

95
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:26,985
Professor Matei
is getting senile.

96
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:29,756
He told us the same thing
three or four times.

97
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:32,158
I didn't
notice. I was asleep.

98
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,261
Let's go get
something to eat.

99
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:38,931
<i>Is it true?</i>

100
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,737
<i>Failure, success.</i>

101
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:46,738
<i>Such extremes, Dominic.</i>

102
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:49,177
You yourself taught me
about Chandrakirti.

103
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:52,647
The concept of tetralemma logic,
the four possibilities.

104
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:55,949
What you say is so,
or it is not so,

105
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,635
it's also so
and not so combined, heh,

106
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:01,320
or it's neither so
nor not so combined.

107
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:02,754
<i>You know,</i>

108
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,092
<i>I've never told you this,</i>

109
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,394
<i>but Dr. Chavannes' lecture
in Paris...</i>

110
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:07,561
I waited to see him.

111
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:11,699
I was hoping that he would
accept me as a student.

112
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,867
And he told me that if I didn't
master Chinese, Sanskrit,

113
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:19,640
Tibetan and Japanese,

114
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:22,543
I would never become
a great Oriental list.

115
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:23,777
But didn't you tell him

116
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:25,814
you wanted to study
only the Chinese language?

117
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,148
I did.

118
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,518
<i>I told him that
I'd been studying Chinese</i>

119
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:30,985
<i>for six months,
six hours a day.</i>

120
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:32,752
<i>He stepped up
to the blackboard.</i>

121
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:35,423
<i>He wrote
some 20 characters on it,</i>

122
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:36,824
<i>and he asked me
to pronounce them</i>

123
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:39,927
<i>one by one
and then translate the passage.</i>

124
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:42,797
<i>In order to master Chinese,</i>

125
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:45,934
<i>one must have
the memory of Mandarin.</i>

126
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:50,001
<i>Photographic memory.</i>

127
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:52,307
<i>A memory of a Mandarin.</i>

128
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,012
I remember hearing
about another case,

129
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,182
a priest hit by lightning.

130
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:02,081
Burned over his whole body

131
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:04,588
and would survive
many years afterwards.

132
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,821
True, he was left
blind and mute,

133
00:12:06,822 --> 00:12:08,723
as our man is also probably.

134
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:12,395
Don't talk so loud.
Maybe he can hear you.

135
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:14,397
I want him to hear me.

136
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:17,833
Let's see how he'll react.
Maybe he isn't mute at all.

137
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:19,535
No!

138
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:24,839
Not mute! Not mute!

139
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,711
Try to pronounce any word,
anything.

140
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:37,920
Blue envelope.

141
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:39,121
Envelope...

142
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:43,891
The teeth,
they're barely holding.

143
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:46,895
Call the dentist right now
and see if the x-rays are ready.

144
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,273
What's next?

145
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:59,011
"Romania may be forced
to negotiate with Hitler. "

146
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:01,844
France is abandoning us
to the Nazis.

147
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:04,148
He is right.

148
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,716
His x-rays have come in.

149
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:07,650
You really should
take a look at them.

150
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:13,457
The roots are healthy, but they
are being pushed up by new ones.

151
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,930
So we feel you're out
of danger.

152
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,936
Only now do you begin
to become an interesting case.

153
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:27,337
You understand why,
don't you?

154
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:29,138
The way the lightning
struck you,

155
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:32,343
you had to have been killed
on the spot,

156
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,513
or else to have died
of asphyxiation.

157
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:39,350
At best you'd
be left paralyzed,

158
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,189
mute or blind.

159
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:51,962
You are lucky,
I'll give you that.

160
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,001
Yes.

161
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,339
We had ordered a set of dentures
to allow you to eat

162
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:02,940
and above all,
to speak normally.

163
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,211
But the x-rays show
that, uh,

164
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:11,583
a new set of teeth
are ready to appear.

165
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,685
It's impossible.

166
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,055
Yes. It's simply impossible.

167
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:21,561
And yet the x-rays are clear.

168
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,262
You are getting new teeth.

169
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:30,471
This is no longer a case
of a living dead man,

170
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:32,272
but of something else.

171
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:35,643
What, exactly,

172
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:37,477
we still don't know.

173
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:41,214
Your recovery is amazing.

174
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:47,554
I don't want to tire you out.

175
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,258
Get some rest.
I'll be back tomorrow.

176
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:59,401
News stories
and feature articles

177
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:02,436
are starting to appear
in different papers,

178
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:05,906
the majority of them absurd,
ridiculous.

179
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:10,877
What are you doing?

180
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,091
New teeth!

181
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:28,462
But you must help us
understand this.

182
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:31,665
We have to know more about you,
who you are,

183
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,967
what your profession is.

184
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:35,705
What's your real age?

185
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:38,707
Please cooperate
a little more.

186
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,578
Were you so stubborn
when you were young?

187
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,016
Always.

188
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:50,788
<i>What is this you
insist on writing, young man?</i>

189
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:55,757
Well, I've almost finished
with antiquity, the Middle Ages.

190
00:15:55,793 --> 00:16:00,096
But the most exciting part,
the origins.

191
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:02,065
The origins of language, of-

192
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,966
But when will
you finish it, Dominic?

193
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:06,432
He needs 10 lifetimes
to do it all.

194
00:16:06,469 --> 00:16:09,306
The origins of
language, human consciousness,

195
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:11,174
even the idea
of time itself.

196
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:13,940
This would call for years
of research.

197
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:16,547
And what with the inexperience
of our provincial...

198
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:18,680
...librarians.

199
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:21,450
I'm terribly sorry,
professor.

200
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:27,357
I have an appointment.
I really must run.

201
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:33,329
He's brilliant. Brilliant. But-

202
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,236
Laura, I'm so sorry.
I completely forgot.

203
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:40,902
We have to talk,
Dominic.

204
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:42,574
It's very important
for both of us,

205
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,774
and I can't hide it
any longer.

206
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,441
Of course.

207
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:48,979
It's snowing. Should we go
to the Café Select?

208
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,718
No. And please don't interrupt.
It's not what you think.

209
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:06,164
I feel that you aren't mine,

210
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:08,964
that you are never here with me.

211
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,538
That you-
That you live in another time.

212
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,537
I'm not thinking
of your research,

213
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:19,444
which in spite of what
you believe, does interest me.

214
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:21,613
I wanted to help you
with that.

215
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:24,884
But you keep yourself shut away
in an alien world,

216
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:26,618
one I can't enter.

217
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:31,458
So for my sake and for yours,

218
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:34,393
we should break
our engagement and separate.

219
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:35,925
No.

220
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:36,993
Laura, no.

221
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:39,800
We are still young.

222
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:42,267
We both love life.

223
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:48,073
You will have more time
for your research.

224
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,378
You'll see later.

225
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:28,482
Tell the professor
what he wants to know.

226
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,953
Tell him you need
a new identity.

227
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,666
All right, you can go.
I'll be here all afternoon.

228
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:54,910
I understand
that you are willing

229
00:18:54,911 --> 00:18:57,144
to speak to me candidly.

230
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,884
You don't have to make
a great effort.

231
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:05,553
The words you cannot pronounce,
you can write.

232
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,529
My name...

233
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:17,532
is Dominic Matei.

234
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:23,137
On January the 8th...

235
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:25,706
I reached the age of 70.

236
00:19:25,742 --> 00:19:27,942
I am a teacher
in Piatra Neamt.

237
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:32,581
I live on Strada Episcopiei
at Number 18.

238
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:34,715
It is my house.

239
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,722
It contains a library of...

240
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:44,728
some 8,000 volumes...

241
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:50,702
which I have willed
to the lycée.

242
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:58,741
You're 70 years old?

243
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:05,514
Extraordinary.

244
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:08,753
If...

245
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:11,756
If you require further proof,
I can tell you the...

246
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:15,644
titles of the books
on my desk or any other...

247
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,531
There's an album
of photographs somewhere?

248
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:23,869
More precisely, with pictures
of you when you were young?

249
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:27,369
And some, uh, clothing?

250
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:30,775
I implore you
to be very, very discreet.

251
00:20:30,777 --> 00:20:32,827
Agents from the Secret Service,

252
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,843
they'll never believe
I'm past 70

253
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:39,484
and therefore they'll never
believe I am who I say I am.

254
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:42,519
Of course.
We'll be very careful.

255
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,691
Anything can happen
if you're interrogated by them.

256
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,492
I won't let that happen.

257
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,527
It's true, though,

258
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:52,231
these are difficult times
in Romania.

259
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:56,501
In truth...

260
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,908
I came here with the intention
of committing suicide.

261
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:08,180
I had saved an envelope
with enough strychnine in it

262
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:10,382
to end my empty life.

263
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:14,120
Please...

264
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:16,622
could you find me
a fictitious identity?

265
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,493
That's not a problem.

266
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:25,198
When your beard comes off,
you'll look like a man of 35,

267
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:29,101
or, um, 40, at most.

268
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:39,513
Don't worry.

269
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:51,525
You're handsome
without the beard, you know?

270
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:56,996
I have your jacket.

271
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:08,575
If you like, you can take me
to the movies sometime.

272
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,434
The sleeves are
too short.

273
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,282
And the tie is no good.

274
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,687
They look like
an old man's clothes.

275
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:38,540
Go with him.

276
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,882
I've seen that car before.

277
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,619
Last night in my dream.

278
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:55,123
Some people might say
that's a bad omen.

279
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,126
I'm not superstitious.

280
00:22:58,562 --> 00:23:00,130
They're waiting for us.

281
00:23:37,737 --> 00:23:39,536
Professor.

282
00:23:45,677 --> 00:23:47,544
Welcome. Thank you, doctor.

283
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,618
There's wild roses
somewhere.

284
00:24:02,895 --> 00:24:06,664
I want you to note down
all that passes through your mind.

285
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:13,305
All the books you've read,
all the languages you know,

286
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:16,874
everything, all the memories,
no matter how insignificant.

287
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,710
If you aren't in the mood
to write,

288
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:20,776
or if you have
too much to say,

289
00:24:20,778 --> 00:24:22,181
use this device.

290
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:31,089
German, I'm sorry to say.

291
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:33,491
A wire recorder.

292
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:41,098
How do I operate this?

293
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:49,408
<i>How do I operate this?</i>

294
00:25:27,415 --> 00:25:29,115
My memory...

295
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:34,455
My memory is unbelievable.

296
00:26:13,227 --> 00:26:15,429
I have a surprise for you.

297
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:17,883
Soon you'll receive
all the things

298
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,335
from your home
in Piatra Neamt:

299
00:26:20,336 --> 00:26:23,005
your reference books,
dictionaries,

300
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:24,907
personal belongings.

301
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,415
Ah.

302
00:26:33,317 --> 00:26:35,583
The watch she gave me.

303
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:39,423
I've brought
your family album.

304
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:43,457
The one with your pictures
from lycée and the university.

305
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,833
What are you thinking?

306
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:55,838
What kind of memories?

307
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:03,480
What kind of associations?

308
00:27:19,164 --> 00:27:22,398
When I look
at that photograph,

309
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:28,072
I sense the heat

310
00:27:28,074 --> 00:27:30,408
of that morning.

311
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:42,720
The fragrance of the oleander.

312
00:27:46,893 --> 00:27:49,227
Laura's scent.

313
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:51,529
Soap...

314
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,967
on her skin.

315
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:57,301
It's unforgettable.

316
00:28:10,782 --> 00:28:14,018
She married someone else,
you know.

317
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:19,059
And a year later
she died in childbirth.

318
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:28,097
It was awful.

319
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:33,205
It's a kind of hypermnesia
with lateral effects.

320
00:28:34,474 --> 00:28:36,511
It's...

321
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:38,547
too much,

322
00:28:39,014 --> 00:28:40,914
and it's useless.

323
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:43,349
It seems useless

324
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,555
because we don't know yet
what to do with it,

325
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,791
with this fantastic

326
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:53,562
recovery of memory.

327
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,726
It's useless.

328
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:57,197
Soon it will be learned

329
00:28:57,198 --> 00:28:58,566
that someone,

330
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:02,203
an old man of unknown origin,
was struck by lightning

331
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,334
and after 10 weeks

332
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,006
appeared perfectly healthy
and young again.

333
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:15,315
Let's hope the rest
will not be found out.

334
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:44,945
The anterior-posterior
diameter, 19 centimeters.

335
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:52,487
The height of the face,
12 centimeters.

336
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:03,431
And the length of
the nose, 6 centimeters.

337
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:08,603
The sexual
organs look like those of a man of 40.

338
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:10,707
They are fully functional.

339
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:14,310
My opinion: the patient
is clinically youthful.

340
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:20,216
I warned you there would be

341
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:23,120
a sort of international
consultation.

342
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,286
They had to see firsthand.

343
00:30:24,287 --> 00:30:25,790
They couldn't believe
the reports

344
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,522
<i>I published
in La Presse Médicale.</i>

345
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:31,828
Well, I wasn't expecting
such questions.

346
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:34,532
Especially since I was still
in the hospital and had no way

347
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:39,037
of confirming or ruling out
sexual possibilities.

348
00:30:39,073 --> 00:30:41,168
Excuse me.

349
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:45,542
In your notebooks,
you speak of erotic dreams.

350
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:48,112
Are you sure they were dreams?

351
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,916
I don't know.

352
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:55,486
But if I've confused erotic
dreams with real experiences,

353
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:57,378
my life is far more interesting
than I'd imagined.

354
00:30:57,379 --> 00:30:58,655
Good,

355
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:01,424
we value this information.

356
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:02,961
Thank you.

357
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:08,532
But in the case
of the young lady in Room 6,

358
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,268
my friend,

359
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:15,804
that woman was imposed on us
by the Secret Service.

360
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:23,048
What young lady in Room 6?

361
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:57,917
Have we met
somewhere before?

362
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,489
Of course we've met before.

363
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,494
Several times, in fact.

364
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:12,998
I am impressed.
You are very discreet.

365
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,969
Where?

366
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,972
And when?

367
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:23,476
Most recently,
last night in Room 6.

368
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:28,981
Your room is next door.

369
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,966
Open up!

370
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:27,438
Second floor is clear.

371
00:34:37,549 --> 00:34:39,751
Sir...
- Over here.

372
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:42,122
Over here or there?
- Hey, get out of the car.

373
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,522
Hey, you, stop
the car. Stop the car.

374
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:42,082
Don't worry.

375
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:44,514
It had to happen
like this,

376
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:47,086
for you to be confused
with others,

377
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:51,357
for people to think you can't
distinguish dream from reality.

378
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,560
Who is taking care of me?

379
00:35:53,561 --> 00:35:57,032
Did you think all you've gone
through is due to chance?

380
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:58,899
Who is watching over me?

381
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,135
It doesn't matter now.
You'll find out later.

382
00:36:02,136 --> 00:36:04,804
Besides, you've guessed
some of it already.

383
00:36:04,805 --> 00:36:07,575
Otherwise, why haven't you
told the professor

384
00:36:07,576 --> 00:36:11,545
about...
certain dreams like this?

385
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:12,880
Stop.

386
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:17,050
If you know
someone else exists,

387
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:20,287
why have you never
referred to it?

388
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:21,757
I must not think,
I must not think,

389
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:23,657
I must not think
of anything.

390
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:26,495
I must not think,
I must not think of anything.

391
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,464
<i>I must not think,
I must not think of anything.</i>

392
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,697
<i>I must not think,
I must not think...</i>

393
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:49,850
<i>Yes.</i>

394
00:36:49,886 --> 00:36:55,557
You learn more quickly,
more profoundly, in sleep.

395
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:57,994
You told the professor
that in sleep

396
00:36:57,995 --> 00:37:00,594
you continued your studies
of the daytime.

397
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,535
Little by little, you discovered
you'd mastered Chinese,

398
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:10,171
just as later, you discovered
you'd mastered other languages.

399
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:15,445
I'm beginning to understand
what's happening to me.

400
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:17,346
Yes.

401
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:19,248
Good.

402
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:24,117
The enormous concentration

403
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:29,091
of electricity that exploded
directly above me

404
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,095
regenerated me and...

405
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:38,604
amplified fabulously
all my mental faculties.

406
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,624
But this electrical discharge
also made possible

407
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,610
the emergence of a new
personality, a sort of...

408
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:48,679
double.

409
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,947
Yes.

410
00:37:52,084 --> 00:37:54,085
The formula of the double

411
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:57,752
is... correct and useful.

412
00:37:57,788 --> 00:38:00,924
But don't be in a hurry
to tell the professor.

413
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:38,163
So, what I can say?

414
00:38:38,165 --> 00:38:39,330
A man was about to

415
00:38:39,331 --> 00:38:41,667
cross the street.

416
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:44,670
He was 70 or 80 years old.

417
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:56,399
The young lady
in Room 6

418
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:59,151
disappeared
two days ago.

419
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,099
Your companion of a night,
or several.

420
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:15,269
I'm afraid it was several.

421
00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:17,971
Do you love me?

422
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:23,578
Yes, more than I could
have imagined.

423
00:39:24,978 --> 00:39:28,950
Tell me how you desire me,
how you long for me.

424
00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:33,319
You are my dream
and my goddess.

425
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,923
She recorded all your conversations

426
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:38,357
and transmitted them
to the Gestapo.

427
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:40,459
And when she asked you
questions

428
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,229
<i>in Russian, Polish
or German,</i>

429
00:39:43,265 --> 00:39:47,268
<i>you replied without difficulty
in all those languages.</i>

430
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:54,274
It's probable that after
listening to the recordings,

431
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:59,747
someone high up in the Reich
decided to kidnap you.

432
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:03,049
Kidnap me?

433
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,118
You have become

434
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:06,952
the most valuable human specimen

435
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,891
existing today
on the face of the earth.

436
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:13,628
Come, have your chicken.

437
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:17,899
All the medical schools
in the world

438
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,234
would like to study you.

439
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:23,188
As a sort of guinea pig.
- Professor.

440
00:40:23,224 --> 00:40:26,140
We are doing all we can
to prevent that.

441
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:28,076
Professor, ahem,

442
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:29,927
in your office,
you must come.

443
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:31,780
Please, professor,
immediately.

444
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:44,859
We are disturbed over your level
of cooperation, Herr Professor.

445
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,863
As you see, your government
has instructed you

446
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,497
to relinquish
the patient

447
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:52,834
and all relevant files
to our custody.

448
00:40:58,175 --> 00:41:03,113
I'm sorry, I cannot
comply with this one.

449
00:41:03,149 --> 00:41:05,615
"Cannot comply"?

450
00:41:05,616 --> 00:41:08,285
I will not turn over
the patient himself.

451
00:41:08,322 --> 00:41:09,818
As his doctor,

452
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:14,358
his condition won't allow
transfer at this time.

453
00:41:20,232 --> 00:41:23,633
I'll return
with a German doctor.

454
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:38,479
Good.

455
00:41:38,516 --> 00:41:40,950
You're behaving as you should

456
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:44,689
in order to create
the necessary confusion.

457
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:48,793
The double.

458
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:52,329
He always answers the questions
I'm ready to ask.

459
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,131
Like a true
guardian angel.

460
00:41:54,132 --> 00:41:58,470
Now that's a correct
and useful formula.

461
00:41:58,471 --> 00:42:00,137
Are there others?

462
00:42:00,173 --> 00:42:01,740
Many.

463
00:42:01,741 --> 00:42:03,674
For example?

464
00:42:03,675 --> 00:42:08,779
Along with angels and guardian
angels, there are powers:

465
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,814
Archangels,

466
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,820
seraphim, cherubim.

467
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:17,688
Intermediary beings
par excellence.

468
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:19,490
Intermediary
between consciousness

469
00:42:19,527 --> 00:42:22,428
and unconsciousness?

470
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:24,196
Well, of course.

471
00:42:25,364 --> 00:42:28,067
But also between
nature and man,

472
00:42:28,104 --> 00:42:30,970
man and the divine,

473
00:42:30,971 --> 00:42:35,039
reason and Eros.

474
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,444
Feminine and masculine,

475
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,597
darkness and light,

476
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:41,713
matter and spirit.

477
00:42:44,885 --> 00:42:48,088
So it's come back
to my old passion again:

478
00:42:49,256 --> 00:42:52,592
philosophy of religion.

479
00:42:52,593 --> 00:42:55,194
Yes,

480
00:42:55,195 --> 00:42:57,930
for you it will always
come back to that.

481
00:43:00,235 --> 00:43:02,735
But I can't believe
in the objective reality

482
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:05,972
of the person
with whom I'm conversing. I-

483
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:10,877
I can only think of him
as my double.

484
00:43:10,878 --> 00:43:13,580
Well, in a sense,

485
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:16,149
that's what he is, but...

486
00:43:17,584 --> 00:43:21,456
that doesn't mean
he doesn't exist

487
00:43:21,457 --> 00:43:23,825
in an objective way
independently.

488
00:43:23,861 --> 00:43:26,157
Oh, I'd like to be convinced,
but-

489
00:43:26,194 --> 00:43:31,132
In metaphysical controversies,
empirical proofs

490
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:33,966
lose their value, but...

491
00:43:38,274 --> 00:43:41,541
wouldn't you enjoy receiving

492
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:44,677
a few fresh roses

493
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:46,515
picked from the garden?

494
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:48,780
I've always liked roses.

495
00:43:48,817 --> 00:43:51,453
Well, where would you like me
to put them?

496
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:56,425
Not in the vase,
at any rate.

497
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:01,029
One right here

498
00:44:01,066 --> 00:44:03,498
in my hand...

499
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:09,238
as I'm holding it now, open.

500
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:20,883
And another on my knee?

501
00:44:27,189 --> 00:44:29,092
The third rose.

502
00:44:29,093 --> 00:44:32,095
Where do you want me
to put the third rose?

503
00:44:33,364 --> 00:44:35,430
Let's see.

504
00:44:38,535 --> 00:44:41,735
Things are more serious
than we thought.

505
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:46,275
We know now why the Gestapo
will try anything,

506
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:48,946
anything, in order to get
their hands on you.

507
00:44:50,748 --> 00:44:51,914
Why?

508
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:55,318
Among the intimates
of Goebbels,

509
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:58,355
there is an enigmatic
and ambiguous person,

510
00:44:58,356 --> 00:45:01,358
a certain Dr. Josef Rudolf.

511
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:09,233
<i>Dr. Rudolf believes that
electrocution by a current</i>

512
00:45:09,234 --> 00:45:11,235
<i>of at least a million volts</i>

513
00:45:11,236 --> 00:45:13,569
<i>could produce
a radical mutation</i>

514
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,839
<i>of the human species.</i>

515
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:20,076
<i>Word of these experiments</i>

516
00:45:20,077 --> 00:45:23,045
<i>has reached the ear
of Adolf Hitler,</i>

517
00:45:23,081 --> 00:45:26,751
<i>who has become personally
interested in your case.</i>

518
00:45:32,255 --> 00:45:35,326
Attention!
The experiment begins!

519
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:02,754
They want
us to lend you to them

520
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:05,324
for a period of time.

521
00:46:05,325 --> 00:46:07,160
God help me.

522
00:46:07,196 --> 00:46:08,995
Time, Dominic,

523
00:46:10,263 --> 00:46:13,333
we are running out of time.

524
00:46:23,411 --> 00:46:26,079
Austrian-Swiss
border. Passport control.

525
00:46:26,115 --> 00:46:30,349
Please disembark
with all luggage.

526
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:17,598
An order has just come in
from Vienna

527
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:21,135
that certain nationals
will be detained.

528
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:24,639
But why? I have
a valid passport and visa.

529
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,407
Please take a step back.

530
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:55,304
Go on!

531
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:59,241
My cooperation with the Nazis
is only symbolic.

532
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:01,010
Go ahead.

533
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,378
Thank you.

534
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,981
<i>Geneva.</i>

535
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:41,284
<i>1941, May the 7th.</i>

536
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:44,387
<i>Dominic Matei, dictation.</i>

537
00:48:51,362 --> 00:48:54,199
The documents in the Geneva
safety-deposit box

538
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,502
summarize my life,
which was profoundly changed

539
00:48:57,503 --> 00:48:59,569
in the spring of 1938,

540
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,841
in front of the Gara de Nord
railway station

541
00:49:01,842 --> 00:49:03,174
in Bucharest.

542
00:49:03,175 --> 00:49:04,640
My first experiences

543
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:08,581
were described and analyzed
by Professor Roman Stanciulescu,

544
00:49:08,582 --> 00:49:12,382
in reports which were
confiscated by the Nazis.

545
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:19,824
<i>The war rages around me.</i>

546
00:49:19,825 --> 00:49:22,627
<i>I am a fugitive
in neutral Switzerland,</i>

547
00:49:22,628 --> 00:49:24,396
<i>encircled by the Axis powers.</i>

548
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:33,405
<i>My Romanian homeland has
made a pact with the devil,</i>

549
00:49:33,406 --> 00:49:35,240
<i>Adolf Hitler,</i>

550
00:49:35,241 --> 00:49:38,012
<i>and may soon be under siege.</i>

551
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,515
<i>I've lost contact
with my dear friend,</i>

552
00:49:43,516 --> 00:49:45,149
<i>Professor Stanciulescu,</i>

553
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,686
<i>which could mean
that he's been killed.</i>

554
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:58,064
<i>I live in fear,</i>

555
00:49:58,065 --> 00:50:00,600
<i>dreading what awaits
in the alleyways.</i>

556
00:50:00,637 --> 00:50:02,799
<i>Eluding capture by my wits,</i>

557
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:05,372
<i>moving from hotel
to rooming house,</i>

558
00:50:05,373 --> 00:50:07,607
<i>always working on my book.</i>

559
00:50:10,076 --> 00:50:12,612
<i>November the 30th, 1941.</i>

560
00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:17,350
<i>Zurich. Dominic Matei.</i>

561
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:18,883
<i>I have explained
in portfolio B</i>

562
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,887
<i>how I instinctually
found the talent</i>

563
00:50:20,888 --> 00:50:23,591
<i>to preserve myself.</i>

564
00:50:23,592 --> 00:50:25,559
<i>Living like a secret agent,</i>

565
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,995
<i>I discovered abilities
to forge documents,</i>

566
00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:31,798
<i>change addresses
and prepare disguises.</i>

567
00:50:38,439 --> 00:50:41,875
<i>Shortly before he disappeared,
Professor Stanciulescu</i>

568
00:50:41,877 --> 00:50:44,379
<i>arranged a bank account
for me in Geneva</i>

569
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:46,881
<i>under the name
of William Pedersen.</i>

570
00:50:48,317 --> 00:50:50,853
<i>Now, without him,
these funds will be depleted.</i>

571
00:50:50,854 --> 00:50:53,120
Oh, good morning,
Mr. Pedersen.

572
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:55,823
<i>And I will have
to find other means.</i>

573
00:50:58,228 --> 00:51:01,665
<i>February the 20th, 1942.</i>

574
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:03,498
<i>Bern.</i>

575
00:51:03,499 --> 00:51:07,436
<i>I must face the undeniable
and chilling truth,</i>

576
00:51:07,472 --> 00:51:08,971
<i>that I am a mutant.</i>

577
00:51:08,972 --> 00:51:12,407
<i>Like a character
in a science-fiction novel,</i>

578
00:51:12,408 --> 00:51:16,012
<i>I am a strange superman
of the future.</i>

579
00:51:17,446 --> 00:51:22,316
<i>I have access to knowledge
unavailable to mankind.</i>

580
00:51:22,353 --> 00:51:25,587
<i>Powers I don't fully
understand.</i>

581
00:51:30,259 --> 00:51:34,530
<i>Despite this, I try to behave
as an ordinary intellectual,</i>

582
00:51:34,531 --> 00:51:36,732
<i>working to complete my book,</i>

583
00:51:36,733 --> 00:51:38,935
<i>documenting the origin
of language</i>

584
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:41,104
<i>and human consciousness.</i>

585
00:51:41,105 --> 00:51:45,141
<i>I began to realize that
with any text I had before me,</i>

586
00:51:45,177 --> 00:51:47,311
<i>if I wanted to know
the content,</i>

587
00:51:47,347 --> 00:51:51,113
<i>I simply... knew it.</i>

588
00:51:55,685 --> 00:51:59,688
<i>Lake Campione.
October the 23rd, 1942.</i>

589
00:52:03,392 --> 00:52:06,693
<i>I found I could augment
my income.</i>

590
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,268
<i>Winning just enough
not to arouse suspicion.</i>

591
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:12,901
No more bets.

592
00:52:12,938 --> 00:52:16,507
<i>Nothing is as it seems,
I am the proof of that.</i>

593
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,043
We've got a winner.

594
00:52:18,044 --> 00:52:19,994
Dominic Matei?

595
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:21,945
Dominic Matei.

596
00:52:21,946 --> 00:52:24,681
<i>I trust no one.</i>

597
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,417
Look at these.

598
00:52:27,418 --> 00:52:29,687
See? These were taken
at the clinic

599
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,557
of Dr. Stanciulescu...

600
00:52:32,594 --> 00:52:35,859
in 1938.

601
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,932
And to think, 10 months ago,
on January 8th,

602
00:52:39,968 --> 00:52:41,598
you turned 74 years old.

603
00:52:43,435 --> 00:52:44,534
Eleven again.

604
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:45,935
You're trying
to look older too.

605
00:52:45,936 --> 00:52:48,206
Those glasses aren't
even prescription.

606
00:52:51,078 --> 00:52:54,445
I still don't- Thank you.
I still don't know

607
00:52:54,446 --> 00:52:56,347
with whom I have the pleasure
to be speaking.

608
00:52:56,348 --> 00:52:58,482
Ted Jones, Jr.

609
00:52:58,483 --> 00:53:01,554
<i>I'm a correspondent
for LIFE magazine.</i>

610
00:53:01,591 --> 00:53:03,753
Listen.

611
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,826
Switzerland is entirely
surrounded by the Axis powers.

612
00:53:06,862 --> 00:53:09,895
I'm cashing out.
Thank you.

613
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:12,294
I'm on special assignment
for the United States.

614
00:53:12,331 --> 00:53:15,333
I really think you're
confusing me with someone else.

615
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:18,070
We can protect your identity,
completely.

616
00:53:18,071 --> 00:53:20,873
I have a very powerful
organization behind me.

617
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,044
I know I can be
of some service to you.

618
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,175
We can pay you, or we can make

619
00:53:26,212 --> 00:53:28,781
some arrangements for you,
anything that might help you.

620
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:37,824
You know,
your English is perfect,

621
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:40,394
but you're not saying anything.

622
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:46,532
I'm afraid I must remain
neutral in all of this.

623
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:48,201
Now, if you'll excuse me.

624
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:52,371
<i>If someone were to tell me
that there exist among us</i>

625
00:53:52,372 --> 00:53:57,210
<i>authentic magicians, saints,
bodhisattvas,</i>

626
00:53:57,212 --> 00:54:00,412
<i>or anyone endowed
with miraculous powers,</i>

627
00:54:00,413 --> 00:54:01,847
<i>I would believe them.</i>

628
00:54:01,884 --> 00:54:05,752
In a certain sense,
what you say is true.

629
00:54:05,753 --> 00:54:07,820
But you've attained
the freedom to accept

630
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:09,253
or reject
these new conditions

631
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:14,127
to use them to finish
your life's work, or not.

632
00:54:14,128 --> 00:54:16,563
Have you decided?

633
00:54:18,233 --> 00:54:21,168
To use them for good

634
00:54:21,205 --> 00:54:22,736
or for evil.

635
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:25,507
<i>Have you decided?</i>

636
00:54:45,628 --> 00:54:47,025
<i>Despite my precautions,</i>

637
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:48,864
<i>I was afraid
I would inadvertently</i>

638
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:51,699
<i>give myself away
conversing with professors</i>

639
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,868
<i>and colleagues
at the university.</i>

640
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:57,173
<i>I knew more than any of them
and understood things</i>

641
00:54:57,174 --> 00:54:59,640
<i>they never even
suspected existed.</i>

642
00:55:15,623 --> 00:55:16,991
I know you're
a good friend

643
00:55:16,992 --> 00:55:18,930
of the Romanian
Professor Stanciulescu.

644
00:55:18,931 --> 00:55:23,566
I'm very sorry. I heard he died
in a plane crash, an accident.

645
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:27,503
But we can talk about this
when my friend gets here.

646
00:55:27,504 --> 00:55:29,472
I told him to come at 9:00.

647
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:31,657
Your friend?

648
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:33,844
Dr. Monroe.

649
00:55:33,845 --> 00:55:37,280
The director of an important
gerontology foundation.

650
00:55:38,815 --> 00:55:42,786
He's Swiss, like me.

651
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:47,256
Like you.

652
00:55:53,663 --> 00:55:55,734
You know,
I do have a name.

653
00:55:56,636 --> 00:55:59,304
Would you like to know it?

654
00:56:10,215 --> 00:56:11,482
Be careful.

655
00:56:14,685 --> 00:56:17,471
He knows who you are.

656
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:20,256
Hello, I'm Dr. Monroe.

657
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:22,026
Head of the foundation
investigating

658
00:56:22,063 --> 00:56:23,760
the materials
of Professor Stanciulescu.

659
00:56:27,132 --> 00:56:29,835
I'm afraid I have no idea
to what you're referring.

660
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:32,202
The belief that youth and life

661
00:56:32,204 --> 00:56:34,373
can be prolonged in any way
other than by the purely

662
00:56:34,374 --> 00:56:35,707
biochemical ones.

663
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:36,976
You do know
what I'm referring to?

664
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,044
No, I'm sorry.

665
00:56:40,045 --> 00:56:43,081
Methods proposed
by that Nazi, Dr. Rudolf.

666
00:56:43,082 --> 00:56:48,455
Electrocution by means
of a million or more volts.

667
00:56:48,456 --> 00:56:49,952
Insane.

668
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,058
Fortunately, I believe
that method was never tried.

669
00:56:53,095 --> 00:56:56,129
But our informants said
that Professor Stanciulescu

670
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:59,466
had worked with a somewhat
analogous case of rejuvenation

671
00:56:59,467 --> 00:57:01,664
induced by a bolt
of lightning.

672
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,840
We know who you are,
Mr. Dominic Matei.

673
00:57:09,374 --> 00:57:12,244
Now, I have a prior engagement,
I really must run.

674
00:57:12,245 --> 00:57:14,343
I'm terribly sorry.
- I know.

675
00:57:14,379 --> 00:57:17,683
Perhaps we could have dinner.
Later tonight?

676
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,175
Mr. Matei?

677
00:57:41,176 --> 00:57:43,543
What do we do with time?

678
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,784
That question,
"what do we do with time"

679
00:57:49,786 --> 00:57:55,455
expresses the supreme ambiguity
of the human condition.

680
00:57:55,456 --> 00:57:58,291
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

681
00:57:58,294 --> 00:58:01,562
An opportunity has been
given to us.

682
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:05,468
We, the human race.

683
00:58:06,902 --> 00:58:08,403
"We"?

684
00:58:10,206 --> 00:58:11,273
No.

685
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:24,918
You and I both know
what is coming:

686
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:27,656
atomic warfare,
cataclysmic destruction.

687
00:58:27,657 --> 00:58:29,857
But unlike the others,

688
00:58:29,858 --> 00:58:34,330
I'm trying to find a meaning
to this impending catastrophe.

689
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,532
Think of me as the last
European optimist.

690
00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:39,135
This can be our life's work.

691
00:58:39,136 --> 00:58:40,938
Please.

692
00:58:44,273 --> 00:58:48,445
There are a few of us who since
1938 have known that you exist.

693
00:58:50,246 --> 00:58:52,348
The fact that you appeared
all of a sudden

694
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:54,549
means that you have
a special mission

695
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,853
and that you possess means
of knowledge much superior

696
00:58:57,854 --> 00:58:59,755
to those available to us.

697
00:58:59,756 --> 00:59:01,426
You are gravely mistaken.

698
00:59:04,095 --> 00:59:08,232
What is indispensable
to a truly human existence?

699
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:10,097
For instance,

700
00:59:10,134 --> 00:59:15,872
the Occidental artistic
treasury, music and poetry,

701
00:59:15,873 --> 00:59:19,144
but also a part
of classic philosophy,

702
00:59:19,145 --> 00:59:23,978
and above all, science.

703
00:59:24,014 --> 00:59:26,017
Post-historic man
will be allergic to science

704
00:59:26,054 --> 00:59:27,618
for at least
one or two centuries.

705
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:31,853
No, always science.

706
00:59:31,854 --> 00:59:34,560
Science above all.
Dominic.

707
00:59:34,561 --> 00:59:36,093
I'm surprised at you.

708
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:38,183
Dominic, don't believe
anything he says.

709
00:59:38,184 --> 00:59:39,496
Shut up!

710
00:59:39,497 --> 00:59:41,633
I will tell him the truth.

711
00:59:41,634 --> 00:59:43,967
Come, Dominic,
join me in this work.

712
00:59:43,968 --> 00:59:45,770
He is Dr. Josef Rudolf,

713
00:59:45,771 --> 00:59:48,038
Hitler's most
dedicated scientist.

714
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,975
Adolf Hitler?

715
00:59:55,547 --> 00:59:57,950
If you actually knew him...

716
00:59:59,451 --> 01:00:02,488
If you had ever been with him,
in his presence...

717
01:00:03,923 --> 01:00:05,957
If I could describe it to you...

718
01:00:07,626 --> 01:00:09,927
Well, uh,

719
01:00:09,928 --> 01:00:11,564
you will meet him soon enough.

720
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:19,739
No! The Gestapo
had Stanciulescu killed

721
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,304
and Rudolf was the one-
Traitor!

722
01:00:25,678 --> 01:00:28,181
You have no choice
in the matter.

723
01:00:28,182 --> 01:00:29,679
Dominic.

724
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:35,022
You were
the honey in my dreams.

725
01:00:35,058 --> 01:00:37,656
Forgive me. Please, forgive me.

726
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,465
It's true what he says.

727
01:00:45,798 --> 01:00:47,899
You really have no choice
in the matter.

728
01:02:02,377 --> 01:02:06,848
Geneva 1955, 20th of August,

729
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:09,351
about 10:31 a. m.
Dominic Matei.

730
01:02:09,353 --> 01:02:12,370
<i>I've decided to stop
making notes in English</i>

731
01:02:12,406 --> 01:02:15,389
<i>and instead to use
an artificial language</i>

732
01:02:15,426 --> 01:02:17,126
<i>of my own invention.</i>

733
01:02:17,128 --> 01:02:21,764
Now I can describe paradoxical situations...

734
01:02:21,801 --> 01:02:25,467
impossible to express in any existing language.

735
01:02:25,468 --> 01:02:27,736
This will permit me to reveal facts...

736
01:02:27,739 --> 01:02:31,174
I have not dared to confess in writing.

737
01:02:31,175 --> 01:02:33,675
This language will only be deciphered...

738
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:36,944
by means of a perfected computer.

739
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:40,382
So my testimony is addressed to the future...

740
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,388
let us say in the year 2010.

741
01:02:43,424 --> 01:02:45,188
But to whom?

742
01:02:45,189 --> 01:02:47,721
The coming nuclear wars...

743
01:02:47,757 --> 01:02:50,461
will destroy many civilizations...

744
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:53,697
Undoubtedly, this will unleash...

745
01:02:53,698 --> 01:02:59,537
a wave of deep pessimism, historically unprecedented.

746
01:02:59,574 --> 01:03:02,340
A general despondency.

747
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:05,676
My testimony, deciphered in the future...

748
01:03:05,677 --> 01:03:08,479
could counter the despair...

749
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,371
because it shows the potential of humanity:

750
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:13,253
<i>a species superior to Homo sapiens,</i>

751
01:03:13,254 --> 01:03:16,890
<i>born in a far-off future.</i>

752
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:19,660
<i>This depends on the preservation</i>

753
01:03:19,661 --> 01:03:23,096
<i>of the material in the safe-deposit box.</i>

754
01:03:23,097 --> 01:03:26,833
<i>I don't know how this will be assured.</i>

755
01:03:30,905 --> 01:03:34,074
<i>But I do not doubt that the material</i>

756
01:03:34,075 --> 01:03:37,743
<i>will be preserved.</i>

757
01:03:39,346 --> 01:03:42,849
<i>Otherwise,</i>

758
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:44,750
<i>my life would have no meaning.</i>

759
01:03:55,696 --> 01:03:56,863
Hello!

760
01:03:59,031 --> 01:04:00,665
Excuse me,

761
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:03,034
what's the best way
up to the top?

762
01:04:11,411 --> 01:04:12,811
Is it Laura?

763
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:15,447
She's afraid of curvy roads.

764
01:04:15,448 --> 01:04:17,615
I really don't think
you should go on.

765
01:04:17,616 --> 01:04:19,251
There's a storm coming in.

766
01:04:19,252 --> 01:04:24,322
We're used to mountain storms.
And anyway, we can't wait.

767
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:26,023
It is.

768
01:04:30,196 --> 01:04:32,631
Our vacation will
be over in a few days.

769
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:33,932
Maybe I can help.

770
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:39,269
That's it.

771
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:42,774
That's it.

772
01:04:43,943 --> 01:04:47,611
I'm Veronica.
What's your name?

773
01:04:47,612 --> 01:04:48,712
Dominic.

774
01:04:48,713 --> 01:04:51,315
With her,
you use your real name.

775
01:04:54,187 --> 01:04:55,887
Thank you.

776
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:04,260
Be careful.

777
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:06,029
Goodbye, Dominic.

778
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,935
<i>I can only guess what happened.</i>

779
01:05:10,936 --> 01:05:12,869
<i>When the big storm broke out,</i>

780
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,170
they were probably
on the road

781
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:15,805
that runs under
the mountain wall,

782
01:05:15,806 --> 01:05:18,007
where most
of the lightning struck.

783
01:05:18,008 --> 01:05:20,444
I'm afraid they could have
been buried in a rockslide

784
01:05:20,445 --> 01:05:23,814
or a close strike of lightning
can cause a heart attack.

785
01:05:26,484 --> 01:05:27,484
Your name?

786
01:05:27,485 --> 01:05:30,019
Martin Audricourt.

787
01:05:32,424 --> 01:05:34,224
Passport, please.

788
01:05:40,964 --> 01:05:44,468
You know, I can always
go in a taxi by myself.

789
01:05:46,036 --> 01:05:48,905
If I need help, I'll call
from the first service station.

790
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:03,018
I don't think they could
have had time to reach the shelter.

791
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:05,154
They could have taken refuge

792
01:06:05,155 --> 01:06:07,789
in one of the crevices
in the wall.

793
01:06:09,893 --> 01:06:11,760
Oh, there's their car.

794
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:16,698
There's a woman
over here.

795
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,581
She's dead.

796
01:06:41,723 --> 01:06:45,760
<i>Om, shanti</i>

797
01:06:45,761 --> 01:06:48,029
<i>Shanti</i>

798
01:06:49,364 --> 01:06:50,731
Veronica?

799
01:06:51,733 --> 01:06:54,936
What happened?
Are you all right?

800
01:06:59,575 --> 01:07:01,441
Sanskrit.

801
01:07:02,944 --> 01:07:04,711
How can it be?

802
01:07:41,114 --> 01:07:44,117
She's had a shock.
She's suffering from amnesia.

803
01:07:44,118 --> 01:07:46,553
What language is that?
What is she speaking?

804
01:07:46,554 --> 01:07:50,289
It's an Indian language,
I think.

805
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:56,296
Her papers identify her
as Veronica Buehler, age 25.

806
01:07:56,297 --> 01:07:57,863
Occupation: school teacher.

807
01:07:57,864 --> 01:08:00,599
Living in Liestal,
Canton Bâle-Campagne.

808
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,468
Excuse me.
- Please.

809
01:08:02,469 --> 01:08:04,970
You're the only one
who can calm her

810
01:08:04,971 --> 01:08:07,840
and speak her language,
Mr...?

811
01:08:07,841 --> 01:08:09,208
Audricourt.

812
01:08:09,209 --> 01:08:11,009
I'm a student of linguistics.

813
01:08:28,894 --> 01:08:34,098
Greetings.

814
01:08:34,968 --> 01:08:37,568
What is your name?

815
01:08:41,941 --> 01:08:46,511
It is a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

816
01:08:49,381 --> 01:08:52,350
My name is Rupini.

817
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,687
Thank you.

818
01:09:02,228 --> 01:09:03,994
Good morning.

819
01:09:06,965 --> 01:09:09,500
What can you tell us,
Mr. Audricourt?

820
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,014
The young woman believes

821
01:09:24,015 --> 01:09:26,350
she is living
in northeastern India

822
01:09:26,351 --> 01:09:27,617
14 centuries ago.

823
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,954
She feels
that she has spent

824
01:09:30,955 --> 01:09:35,625
several months
in a cave meditating.

825
01:09:37,262 --> 01:09:39,896
Now, this is where she was
when a big storm broke out

826
01:09:39,897 --> 01:09:43,801
and she saw lightning strike
above her on the mountain.

827
01:09:43,802 --> 01:09:49,172
Many large rocks were dislodged,
blocking the mouth of the cave.

828
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:52,908
Is that all?

829
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:56,146
She asserts her name
is Rupini,

830
01:09:57,714 --> 01:10:00,417
daughter of Nagabhatta,

831
01:10:00,418 --> 01:10:04,653
descended from one of the first
families to convert to Buddhism.

832
01:10:06,255 --> 01:10:12,495
She became a disciple
of the philosopher Chandrakirti,

833
01:10:12,496 --> 01:10:17,499
which is why she was in the cave
copying down his works.

834
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,334
I see.

835
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:24,439
Would you mind if I discuss this
a moment with my colleagues?

836
01:10:25,609 --> 01:10:27,441
Not at all.

837
01:10:45,595 --> 01:10:48,396
We will invite
some doctors from, uh,

838
01:10:48,397 --> 01:10:51,666
Zurich, Basel and Geneva
to come to see her.

839
01:10:52,869 --> 01:10:54,301
I...

840
01:10:54,302 --> 01:10:56,638
If I might make a suggestion?

841
01:10:56,639 --> 01:10:58,306
Yes.

842
01:10:58,307 --> 01:11:01,309
Perhaps some experts from
the Oriental Institute in Rome

843
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:02,810
might be necessary.

844
01:11:02,811 --> 01:11:06,180
Necessary for what?

845
01:11:06,181 --> 01:11:10,284
Well, to confirm
if what she's saying is fact.

846
01:11:11,154 --> 01:11:12,753
Fact?

847
01:11:12,754 --> 01:11:14,154
Exactly.

848
01:11:22,931 --> 01:11:25,331
I present to
you Professor Giuseppe Tucci

849
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:26,934
from the Oriental Institute
in Rome.

850
01:11:26,935 --> 01:11:28,768
I am Blasi, his assistant.

851
01:11:31,639 --> 01:11:34,408
Professor
Tucci, it's an honor.

852
01:11:42,616 --> 01:11:46,186
Before we begin,
who wrote the telegram

853
01:11:46,187 --> 01:11:48,021
that included
some of the particulars?

854
01:11:48,023 --> 01:11:50,156
I did, professor.

855
01:11:50,157 --> 01:11:51,691
You're a Sanskritist?

856
01:11:51,692 --> 01:11:54,326
Not exactly. Excuse me.

857
01:11:54,327 --> 01:11:56,664
Uh, but I have an interest
in Oriental studies.

858
01:11:56,665 --> 01:11:59,467
I came only because
of your report.

859
01:11:59,468 --> 01:12:00,798
Thank you.

860
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:03,568
You did well.

861
01:12:10,578 --> 01:12:14,213
Well-being, your ladyship.

862
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,917
Welcome to both of you.

863
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:23,656
Where am I?

864
01:12:23,657 --> 01:12:27,927
Why doesn't anybody
understand me?

865
01:12:30,163 --> 01:12:37,936
As in dreams, the mind presents
the appearance of duality.

866
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:41,239
We've had some of her
remarks translated into English.

867
01:12:42,908 --> 01:12:47,246
The young woman's knowledge
of Madhyamika philosophy

868
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:50,981
and her master, Chandrakirti,
is convincing.

869
01:12:52,185 --> 01:12:54,653
The discussion only became
delicate whenever Rupini

870
01:12:54,689 --> 01:13:00,224
asked what had happened to her,
where she was

871
01:13:00,226 --> 01:13:02,293
and why no one understood her.

872
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:04,228
What did you tell her,
professor?

873
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:06,397
I always
begin by reminding of Maya.

874
01:13:06,398 --> 01:13:08,599
The cosmic illusion.

875
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,102
The great witch.

876
01:13:11,103 --> 01:13:13,304
Actually it's
not a dream, I told her,

877
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:14,472
but it takes part

878
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:17,040
in the illusory nature
of dreaming,

879
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:22,313
because it is the future,
therefore, of time.

880
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:26,283
Now, time is
par excellence unreal.

881
01:13:26,284 --> 01:13:28,485
I don't believe
I convinced her.

882
01:13:28,486 --> 01:13:29,686
But fortunately, she's, uh,

883
01:13:29,687 --> 01:13:31,621
enthusiastic about logic
and dialectics,

884
01:13:31,622 --> 01:13:33,591
and that's mainly
what we discussed.

885
01:13:33,592 --> 01:13:35,059
Uh, professor,

886
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:38,863
could all this possibly be...?

887
01:13:38,864 --> 01:13:41,431
How shall I say?

888
01:13:41,432 --> 01:13:42,933
Fact?

889
01:13:42,934 --> 01:13:45,335
"Fact"?

890
01:13:47,272 --> 01:13:48,805
Mmm.

891
01:13:48,806 --> 01:13:50,674
I would suggest
a journey to India,

892
01:13:50,675 --> 01:13:53,410
more precisely to the province
of Uttar Pradesh,

893
01:13:53,411 --> 01:13:57,581
to the caves where Rupini
claims to have meditated.

894
01:13:57,582 --> 01:14:00,917
I should think
the Oriental Institute of Rome,

895
01:14:00,918 --> 01:14:04,754
of which I am president,
would sponsor the expedition.

896
01:14:04,755 --> 01:14:05,856
And, young man,

897
01:14:05,857 --> 01:14:08,657
I think you should
accompany us to India.

898
01:14:08,658 --> 01:14:10,393
I'd be delighted,
professor.

899
01:14:11,962 --> 01:14:14,597
It's been understood she will
be put into a deep sleep

900
01:14:14,598 --> 01:14:15,898
before leaving the clinic

901
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,500
and will continue
to sleep

902
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:20,702
until we reach the vicinity
of the caves.

903
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:06,614
Start rolling. Rolling!

904
01:15:06,615 --> 01:15:07,916
Tucci! Tucci, look here!

905
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:48,455
We are very close
to the frontier of Nepal.

906
01:15:48,456 --> 01:15:50,724
According to Rupini's account,

907
01:15:50,725 --> 01:15:53,493
this is where we'll find the
cave where she would meditate.

908
01:16:17,918 --> 01:16:20,685
We are very fortunate in having
a pandit from Gorakhpur

909
01:16:20,686 --> 01:16:23,055
familiar with
the Madhyamika philosophy.

910
01:16:23,056 --> 01:16:24,924
He'll be at her side
when she awakens.

911
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:38,537
Everyone,
hide themselves.

912
01:16:55,387 --> 01:16:57,755
No form,

913
01:16:57,756 --> 01:17:00,392
no feeling,

914
01:17:00,393 --> 01:17:01,627
no thought,

915
01:17:01,628 --> 01:17:04,529
no choice,

916
01:17:05,932 --> 01:17:08,032
no consciousness.

917
01:17:12,672 --> 01:17:15,173
Gone, gone,

918
01:17:15,174 --> 01:17:18,175
gone beyond,
completely gone.

919
01:17:19,144 --> 01:17:21,212
Enlightenment.

920
01:17:21,213 --> 01:17:22,846
So be it.

921
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,916
Welcome.

922
01:17:35,927 --> 01:17:39,697
Why did it take you so long?

923
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:42,466
I was already here.

924
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:13,162
I know this place.

925
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:35,852
Stay back. Hide yourself.

926
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:44,925
Over here!

927
01:19:04,714 --> 01:19:06,047
Ah!

928
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:09,684
Oh, God.

929
01:19:09,685 --> 01:19:11,019
Are you all right?

930
01:19:20,896 --> 01:19:23,031
Just be still. Lay still.

931
01:19:24,066 --> 01:19:25,466
Just rest.

932
01:19:25,467 --> 01:19:27,067
Veronica.

933
01:19:28,404 --> 01:19:30,338
She recognized it.

934
01:19:30,339 --> 01:19:32,773
This is the cave!

935
01:19:32,774 --> 01:19:34,307
But the entrance is blocked.

936
01:20:53,186 --> 01:20:57,488
I don't think
you'll be needing me for a while.

937
01:21:21,614 --> 01:21:23,348
She is awake,

938
01:21:23,349 --> 01:21:25,883
but she has not
opened her eyes.

939
01:21:33,358 --> 01:21:35,292
Greetings.

940
01:21:39,532 --> 01:21:43,301
How are you feeling, Rupini?

941
01:21:49,809 --> 01:21:54,211
Didn't we-? Didn't
we ask directions of you today?

942
01:21:56,848 --> 01:21:58,782
<i>My name is Veronica Buehler,</i>

943
01:21:58,783 --> 01:22:01,452
<i>and I speak three languages:</i>

944
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:04,021
<i>German, French and English.</i>

945
01:22:04,022 --> 01:22:07,191
<i>Have you ever tried to
learn any Oriental language?</i>

946
01:22:07,192 --> 01:22:08,358
<i>Never.</i>

947
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:10,828
<i>Or have you ever read anything</i>

948
01:22:10,829 --> 01:22:12,796
<i>about India
or Indian culture?</i>

949
01:22:12,797 --> 01:22:14,598
<i>Some popular books.</i>

950
01:22:14,599 --> 01:22:15,765
<i>Like?</i>

951
01:22:15,767 --> 01:22:18,702
<i>Heh. Rudyard Kipling,
I think?</i>

952
01:22:18,703 --> 01:22:19,966
The Jungle Book.

953
01:22:20,003 --> 01:22:21,571
<i>Have you ever heard</i>

954
01:22:21,572 --> 01:22:23,905
<i>the name Rupini?</i>

955
01:22:23,906 --> 01:22:25,609
<i>No.</i>

956
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:27,678
<i>In an earlier existence,</i>

957
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,346
<i>Veronica Buehler
had been Rupini.</i>

958
01:22:30,347 --> 01:22:34,650
<i>I would say, for the vast
majority of the Oriental lists,</i>

959
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:39,956
<i>a clear example of
the transmigration of the soul.</i>

960
01:22:39,957 --> 01:22:42,125
<i>And, young man, your opinion?</i>

961
01:22:42,126 --> 01:22:44,427
<i>As a neophyte Oriental list,</i>

962
01:22:44,428 --> 01:22:46,796
<i>I can only cite some classical
Indian conceptions,</i>

963
01:22:46,797 --> 01:22:50,099
<i>from Upanishads
to Gautama Buddha.</i>

964
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,101
<i>Excuse me. It is
precisely in the Upanishads</i>

965
01:22:53,103 --> 01:22:56,239
<i>in the Brhadaranyaka
and Chandogya Upanishads</i>

966
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:59,574
<i>that one can find this belief
for the first time.</i>

967
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:01,444
<i>This is karma, isn't it?</i>

968
01:23:01,445 --> 01:23:03,411
But it's hard for me to believe

969
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:05,046
that I ever existed before.

970
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:06,982
How did you say?

971
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:08,617
Metempsychosis.

972
01:23:08,618 --> 01:23:11,086
Metempsychosis.
- Mm-hm.

973
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:13,355
That absolutely
doesn't make sense to me.

974
01:23:15,358 --> 01:23:16,858
Maybe...

975
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:18,426
What?

976
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:21,362
Maybe I was possessed
by an evil spirit.

977
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:23,364
Well...

978
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:24,930
They never leave us alone.

979
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:27,903
It's all so confusing.

980
01:23:27,904 --> 01:23:30,005
I'm afraid
I'm going crazy.

981
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:43,317
Hello, Miss Veronica,
just an interview.

982
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:45,686
That's enough. Let's go.

983
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,287
Taxi!

984
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:53,561
Just drive, drive anywhere.

985
01:24:30,064 --> 01:24:33,832
I- I think
we should get away. I...

986
01:24:35,268 --> 01:24:38,171
I think we should go somewhere.
We should be alone.

987
01:24:38,172 --> 01:24:39,973
We should go to, uh,
somewhere beautiful,

988
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,140
a Mediterranean island.

989
01:24:43,076 --> 01:24:46,378
Dominic, that would make me
very, very happy.

990
01:25:36,762 --> 01:25:39,430
Look, that bird.

991
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:41,866
What kind of birds
do they have in Malta?

992
01:25:41,867 --> 01:25:43,468
That's a Maltese falcon.

993
01:26:03,188 --> 01:26:04,888
Welcome.

994
01:26:04,889 --> 01:26:07,424
Thank you.

995
01:26:13,231 --> 01:26:14,966
No, that's fine.
Thank you.

996
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:16,634
Thank you.

997
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,240
Thanks very much.

998
01:26:27,912 --> 01:26:29,979
Finally alone.

999
01:26:35,552 --> 01:26:38,288
Dominic,
it's beautiful here.

1000
01:26:38,289 --> 01:26:39,989
Yes, it is.

1001
01:26:49,934 --> 01:26:53,136
When I first opened my eyes
and saw you...

1002
01:26:56,339 --> 01:26:59,575
I confess I was thinking,

1003
01:26:59,576 --> 01:27:04,513
if I were three
or four years older and...

1004
01:27:07,384 --> 01:27:09,518
if he were
to ask me to marry him...

1005
01:27:13,556 --> 01:27:15,524
I would say yes.

1006
01:27:27,069 --> 01:27:28,603
Veronica.

1007
01:27:44,053 --> 01:27:45,819
My love.

1008
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:48,222
Is it true?

1009
01:27:57,132 --> 01:27:58,698
Yes.

1010
01:28:07,977 --> 01:28:10,077
I've always loved you.

1011
01:28:38,306 --> 01:28:40,073
Veronica?

1012
01:29:27,087 --> 01:29:28,421
Do you understand it?

1013
01:29:30,289 --> 01:29:32,724
I don't know this language.

1014
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:38,295
Ancient... Beyond...

1015
01:29:38,297 --> 01:29:40,098
Why else did you have
to know her?

1016
01:30:38,923 --> 01:30:40,457
Veronica?

1017
01:30:45,162 --> 01:30:46,162
Veronica...

1018
01:31:02,412 --> 01:31:03,546
It's all right.

1019
01:31:03,547 --> 01:31:05,615
That's all right.
It's all right.

1020
01:31:05,616 --> 01:31:08,317
I've got you.
I've got you.

1021
01:31:08,318 --> 01:31:10,586
I've got you, darling.

1022
01:31:10,587 --> 01:31:13,355
I've got you, Laura.

1023
01:31:13,356 --> 01:31:16,291
It's all right.

1024
01:31:16,292 --> 01:31:18,193
I've got you.

1025
01:31:18,194 --> 01:31:21,496
I've got you, darling.
I've got you, Laura.

1026
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:27,102
I love you, darling.

1027
01:31:27,103 --> 01:31:29,004
I love you.

1028
01:32:33,601 --> 01:32:35,368
Was that Rupini's voice?

1029
01:32:35,369 --> 01:32:37,736
Mm-hm. Yes.

1030
01:32:37,737 --> 01:32:39,906
She's moving back in time

1031
01:32:39,907 --> 01:32:43,610
from Sanskrit
to earlier languages.

1032
01:32:43,611 --> 01:32:45,311
That was Egyptian.

1033
01:32:51,251 --> 01:32:54,254
Perhaps you'll take us back
to a time before history.

1034
01:32:56,157 --> 01:32:58,290
The origins of language,

1035
01:32:58,291 --> 01:33:01,995
which is where I've always
wanted to go, but I never could.

1036
01:33:01,996 --> 01:33:04,564
But it's helping me
finish my work.

1037
01:33:04,565 --> 01:33:05,799
Good.

1038
01:33:07,167 --> 01:33:09,468
Good. I want to help you.

1039
01:33:09,469 --> 01:33:10,536
You know, I'm...

1040
01:33:12,672 --> 01:33:16,676
I'm 88 years old, really.

1041
01:33:21,848 --> 01:33:24,817
If I added up all the years
Rupini lived,

1042
01:33:24,818 --> 01:33:25,984
I'd be older than you.

1043
01:33:27,721 --> 01:33:28,787
Well, then let's go dancing.

1044
01:34:00,553 --> 01:34:01,853
Thank you.

1045
01:34:21,005 --> 01:34:22,506
I don't think
we'll be recognized,

1046
01:34:22,507 --> 01:34:25,008
even with our pictures
in all those magazines.

1047
01:34:25,009 --> 01:34:29,079
Well, our pictures
are still appearing.

1048
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,515
Let me see.

1049
01:34:49,299 --> 01:34:50,566
What's the matter?

1050
01:34:58,175 --> 01:35:01,110
I feel tired all the time,

1051
01:35:01,111 --> 01:35:04,247
and I don't understand why.

1052
01:35:04,248 --> 01:35:08,985
Something is happening
inside me. I can feel it.

1053
01:35:08,986 --> 01:35:10,520
And she's right.

1054
01:35:10,521 --> 01:35:13,789
The Para mediumistic ecstasies
have exhausted her.

1055
01:35:19,663 --> 01:35:21,464
Champagne?

1056
01:36:58,893 --> 01:37:00,526
Veronica?

1057
01:37:08,536 --> 01:37:10,470
Veronica!

1058
01:37:30,424 --> 01:37:34,126
No! Veronica, don't!

1059
01:37:35,862 --> 01:37:37,596
Veronica!

1060
01:37:38,131 --> 01:37:39,931
I was so worried!

1061
01:37:41,301 --> 01:37:42,735
What is it?

1062
01:37:42,736 --> 01:37:44,603
It was a dream.

1063
01:37:44,604 --> 01:37:47,706
A bad dream.

1064
01:37:47,707 --> 01:37:50,442
What was-? What was it?

1065
01:37:52,712 --> 01:37:55,981
I was somewhere beside a river,
and someone,

1066
01:37:55,982 --> 01:37:58,282
a stranger with a head
like a dog,

1067
01:37:58,283 --> 01:37:59,952
was coming toward me.

1068
01:37:59,953 --> 01:38:02,987
And in his hand, he-
He had...

1069
01:38:05,224 --> 01:38:06,925
Explain it to me!

1070
01:38:06,926 --> 01:38:09,694
I want to know
what Rupini knows.

1071
01:38:09,695 --> 01:38:13,364
She knows things
that we don't understand yet.

1072
01:38:13,365 --> 01:38:15,333
No. Let me-

1073
01:38:15,334 --> 01:38:17,567
No, no!

1074
01:38:17,568 --> 01:38:18,936
Don't ever leave me.

1075
01:38:18,937 --> 01:38:20,238
I'll never leave you.

1076
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,340
Don't ever leave me.
I'll never leave you.

1077
01:38:22,341 --> 01:38:24,259
Don't ever leave me.

1078
01:38:24,295 --> 01:38:26,176
I'll never leave you.

1079
01:39:11,922 --> 01:39:13,990
Veronica.

1080
01:39:21,866 --> 01:39:26,001
The stranger in your dream
was probably Shiva.

1081
01:39:28,638 --> 01:39:31,474
And in his hand, a skull.

1082
01:39:33,310 --> 01:39:38,313
For Shiva is both creator
and destroyer combined.

1083
01:40:32,902 --> 01:40:33,902
Dominic?

1084
01:40:33,903 --> 01:40:35,402
There's someone
who looks like you

1085
01:40:35,403 --> 01:40:37,504
spying on us.

1086
01:40:37,505 --> 01:40:38,807
I didn't notice anyone.

1087
01:40:38,843 --> 01:40:40,541
By the gate.

1088
01:40:40,542 --> 01:40:41,875
Come and look.

1089
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,086
There's no one there.

1090
01:41:02,063 --> 01:41:04,296
Maybe I was mistaken.

1091
01:41:06,467 --> 01:41:09,770
You've been in the sun too long.
Let's go inside.

1092
01:41:32,392 --> 01:41:36,528
<i>I'm 88 years old, really.</i>

1093
01:42:22,575 --> 01:42:25,510
She's in a
hyper-suggestive state.

1094
01:42:27,012 --> 01:42:28,513
Tell her you love her.

1095
01:42:30,549 --> 01:42:32,317
Tell her that you've
always loved her.

1096
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,222
I love you.

1097
01:42:39,558 --> 01:42:41,792
I've always loved you.

1098
01:42:53,772 --> 01:42:55,271
That's Sumerian.

1099
01:43:04,915 --> 01:43:06,416
No, it's Babylonian.

1100
01:43:22,234 --> 01:43:24,834
<i>After Egyptian and Babylonian,</i>

1101
01:43:24,835 --> 01:43:27,637
there followed probably
a sample of proto-Elamite

1102
01:43:27,638 --> 01:43:29,972
and one of Sumerian.

1103
01:43:29,973 --> 01:43:33,343
She is descending
deeper and deeper

1104
01:43:33,344 --> 01:43:34,677
into the past.

1105
01:43:34,678 --> 01:43:36,980
But how far back will she go?

1106
01:43:36,981 --> 01:43:40,515
Your life's work will
finally have what was missing.

1107
01:43:42,652 --> 01:43:44,687
<i>Every night for two weeks,</i>

1108
01:43:44,688 --> 01:43:48,257
<i>Veronica went
further back in time.</i>

1109
01:43:48,258 --> 01:43:50,358
<i>Through unknown languages...</i>

1110
01:43:54,696 --> 01:43:56,933
<i>unwritten history.</i>

1111
01:44:07,744 --> 01:44:10,112
<i>Getting closer...</i>

1112
01:44:10,113 --> 01:44:11,647
<i>and closer...</i>

1113
01:44:11,648 --> 01:44:15,983
to the inarticulate moment...

1114
01:44:15,984 --> 01:44:17,985
of the beginning.

1115
01:44:27,896 --> 01:44:30,631
<i>But at what cost?</i>

1116
01:44:32,635 --> 01:44:33,902
<i>Madam is not suffering</i>

1117
01:44:33,903 --> 01:44:36,004
from anything,
anything at all.

1118
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:37,305
Are you sure, doctor?

1119
01:44:37,306 --> 01:44:40,241
Yes. I've prescribed
a series of shots

1120
01:44:40,242 --> 01:44:42,909
with vitamins and minerals.

1121
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:44,947
Perhaps it's...

1122
01:44:44,948 --> 01:44:47,582
the nervous condition

1123
01:44:47,583 --> 01:44:50,118
that precedes menopause

1124
01:44:50,119 --> 01:44:52,487
in certain women.

1125
01:44:52,488 --> 01:44:56,090
Well, just how old do you
take her to be, doctor?

1126
01:44:56,091 --> 01:44:58,692
Late 40s, more or less.

1127
01:45:00,062 --> 01:45:01,462
She's 25.

1128
01:45:21,716 --> 01:45:23,083
Where have all
the mirrors gone?

1129
01:45:31,224 --> 01:45:33,393
Bring one to me.

1130
01:45:34,762 --> 01:45:37,363
Veronica, you're not well.

1131
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:41,333
Bring a mirror to me,
Dominic, please.

1132
01:45:44,539 --> 01:45:45,638
Maybe that one.

1133
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:09,921
I should have understood this
from the beginning.

1134
01:47:09,922 --> 01:47:11,422
One more regression,

1135
01:47:11,423 --> 01:47:13,590
she'll reach
the protolanguage.

1136
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:16,126
Your life's work
will be complete.

1137
01:47:18,362 --> 01:47:20,129
You know I'm right.

1138
01:47:38,882 --> 01:47:40,216
Dominic?

1139
01:47:42,853 --> 01:47:44,453
Dominic?

1140
01:47:51,295 --> 01:47:52,862
Look.

1141
01:47:58,769 --> 01:48:00,669
Come sit with me.

1142
01:48:03,107 --> 01:48:04,907
Come sit with me.

1143
01:48:10,646 --> 01:48:11,913
Veronica.

1144
01:48:11,914 --> 01:48:13,883
Veronica, I'm to blame for this.
No, it's me.

1145
01:48:13,884 --> 01:48:15,885
Listen to me. Listen to me
and don't interrupt.

1146
01:48:15,886 --> 01:48:18,487
Please, listen.

1147
01:48:18,488 --> 01:48:19,887
Listen to me.

1148
01:48:20,889 --> 01:48:22,324
If I continue to live with you,

1149
01:48:22,325 --> 01:48:23,992
by autumn
you will have perished.

1150
01:48:23,993 --> 01:48:25,527
I can't tell you more.

1151
01:48:25,528 --> 01:48:27,929
But I assure you,

1152
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:30,899
in reality, you haven't aged.

1153
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,566
The moment I disappear
from your life,

1154
01:48:32,567 --> 01:48:34,403
your youth and your beauty
will return.

1155
01:48:34,404 --> 01:48:38,472
Don't leave me, Dominic.
Please, don't leave me.

1156
01:48:38,474 --> 01:48:40,641
I was doomed to lose everything
that I love.

1157
01:48:40,642 --> 01:48:43,245
But I'd rather lose you young
and beautiful, the way you were,

1158
01:48:43,246 --> 01:48:47,382
the way you will be again
without me,

1159
01:48:47,383 --> 01:48:49,050
than to watch you perish
in my arms.

1160
01:48:49,051 --> 01:48:53,020
You promised me
you would never leave me.

1161
01:48:53,022 --> 01:48:57,390
I am going to leave you.

1162
01:48:57,391 --> 01:49:01,395
If you leave me,
I will die without you.

1163
01:49:01,396 --> 01:49:02,863
If in a few months,

1164
01:49:02,864 --> 01:49:05,832
you don't find yourself
as you were last autumn,

1165
01:49:05,833 --> 01:49:07,100
I'll come back.

1166
01:49:07,101 --> 01:49:09,771
The minute I receive
your telegram, I'll come back.

1167
01:49:09,772 --> 01:49:12,573
Three or four months,
just wait-

1168
01:49:17,846 --> 01:49:19,078
Somewhere...

1169
01:49:21,515 --> 01:49:23,583
far away from me.

1170
01:49:27,388 --> 01:49:30,890
Don't leave me.
Please. Please.

1171
01:50:03,758 --> 01:50:07,125
Dominic.

1172
01:50:29,482 --> 01:50:30,846
<i>The 3:10 train</i>

1173
01:50:30,883 --> 01:50:33,951
<i>from Bucuresti to lasi
will depart in five minutes.</i>

1174
01:50:36,756 --> 01:50:38,624
<i>The 3:10 train
from Bucuresti to lasi</i>

1175
01:50:38,625 --> 01:50:40,559
<i>will depart in five minutes.</i>

1176
01:50:57,943 --> 01:50:59,276
Good evening.

1177
01:51:01,246 --> 01:51:02,280
Audricourt.

1178
01:51:02,281 --> 01:51:03,981
Sign here, please.

1179
01:51:03,982 --> 01:51:05,583
Thank you.

1180
01:51:08,953 --> 01:51:11,023
On the second floor, Room 19.

1181
01:51:11,059 --> 01:51:12,022
Thank you.

1182
01:51:12,024 --> 01:51:13,390
By the way,

1183
01:51:13,391 --> 01:51:15,359
do you know if the Café Select
still exists?

1184
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,795
How could it not exist?
It's an historic monument.

1185
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:19,396
Of course.

1186
01:51:19,397 --> 01:51:23,034
Have you heard
of Professor Dominic Matei?

1187
01:51:23,035 --> 01:51:24,634
You know,
I was born here.

1188
01:51:24,635 --> 01:51:27,437
Then you know that
he frequented Café Select

1189
01:51:27,438 --> 01:51:31,041
the whole time he was
professor here in Piatra Neamt.

1190
01:51:31,042 --> 01:51:32,576
That's right.

1191
01:51:32,613 --> 01:51:34,111
Here's your key.

1192
01:51:35,114 --> 01:51:36,813
Nineteen?

1193
01:51:36,814 --> 01:51:37,914
The second floor.

1194
01:51:37,915 --> 01:51:39,049
All right.

1195
01:51:40,852 --> 01:51:42,519
Welcome home.

1196
01:51:49,727 --> 01:51:51,661
Café Select.

1197
01:52:30,834 --> 01:52:32,033
<i>Maman.</i>

1198
01:52:33,103 --> 01:52:35,071
<i>Maman.</i>

1199
01:52:36,073 --> 01:52:37,105
<i>Maman.</i>

1200
01:52:37,974 --> 01:52:40,609
<i>Maman.</i>

1201
01:53:06,468 --> 01:53:08,902
"Good and
evil lose their meaning,

1202
01:53:08,903 --> 01:53:10,671
"and in the absolute

1203
01:53:10,672 --> 01:53:14,509
being coincides
with nonbeing. "

1204
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:15,876
Yes, but what no one dares
to say

1205
01:53:15,877 --> 01:53:17,978
is that in the horizon
of these philosophies,

1206
01:53:17,979 --> 01:53:19,079
atomic wars must be,

1207
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,581
if not justified,
at least accepted.

1208
01:53:20,618 --> 01:53:22,282
No, I reject that.

1209
01:53:22,283 --> 01:53:24,785
True meaning of nuclear
catastrophe can only be this:

1210
01:53:24,786 --> 01:53:26,954
The mutation
of the human species,

1211
01:53:26,955 --> 01:53:28,422
and the arrival
of the new man.

1212
01:53:28,423 --> 01:53:29,555
Yes, but atomic wars

1213
01:53:29,556 --> 01:53:32,893
will destroy populations,
civilizations.

1214
01:53:32,894 --> 01:53:35,496
That is the price to be paid.

1215
01:53:35,497 --> 01:53:37,631
How can you even say that?

1216
01:53:37,632 --> 01:53:40,300
The resulting electromagnetic
pulse will create

1217
01:53:40,301 --> 01:53:42,535
an unlimited potential
for post-historic man.

1218
01:53:42,536 --> 01:53:44,304
Yes, but it could go
the other way

1219
01:53:44,305 --> 01:53:46,172
and provoke a regression
in the species.

1220
01:53:46,173 --> 01:53:48,409
All that matters is knowledge

1221
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:50,344
and the perfection
of the human being.

1222
01:53:50,345 --> 01:53:53,914
So you're saying that the end
justifies the means?

1223
01:53:53,915 --> 01:53:56,616
There is no other way.

1224
01:53:56,617 --> 01:53:58,917
Just as there was no other way
for Veronica, just aging

1225
01:53:58,918 --> 01:54:00,453
and suffering and then death.

1226
01:54:00,454 --> 01:54:02,488
There was no other way.

1227
01:54:02,489 --> 01:54:04,590
That's why you've never
finished your book,

1228
01:54:04,591 --> 01:54:06,592
why you'll always be a failure.

1229
01:54:06,593 --> 01:54:07,760
No.

1230
01:54:10,864 --> 01:54:12,899
Dominic, what have you done?

1231
01:54:14,435 --> 01:54:15,535
Oh, Dominic.

1232
01:54:15,536 --> 01:54:18,838
Save me.
Save me, Dominic.

1233
01:54:20,908 --> 01:54:22,642
Dominic, what have you done?

1234
01:54:22,678 --> 01:54:23,976
What have you done?

1235
01:55:58,269 --> 01:56:00,603
And the third rose?

1236
01:56:06,143 --> 01:56:08,744
Where shall
I put the third rose?

1237
01:56:12,283 --> 01:56:14,650
Oh, where shall I put it?

1238
01:57:40,168 --> 01:57:42,068
Dominic?

1239
01:57:44,972 --> 01:57:46,573
Dominic Matei?

1240
01:57:49,111 --> 01:57:53,046
<i>Cuconul Dominic Matei?</i>

1241
01:57:55,749 --> 01:57:58,051
Is it you?

1242
01:58:02,690 --> 01:58:04,488
Praise God,

1243
01:58:04,524 --> 01:58:06,892
you've returned.

1244
01:58:06,893 --> 01:58:10,295
Dr. Neculache, look.
He's back.

1245
01:58:12,199 --> 01:58:15,768
<i>Cuconul Dominic is here.</i>

1246
01:58:15,769 --> 01:58:17,003
<i>In other words,</i>

1247
01:58:17,004 --> 01:58:19,272
<i>the story begins
all over again.</i>

1248
01:58:19,273 --> 01:58:21,173
Old friend.

1249
01:58:21,174 --> 01:58:22,541
Dominic?

1250
01:58:22,542 --> 01:58:24,276
Look, it's you.
- I'm dreaming.

1251
01:58:24,313 --> 01:58:25,979
I am dreaming.

1252
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:27,279
When I wake up,

1253
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:31,183
it will seem like
I've just begun to dream indeed.

1254
01:58:31,184 --> 01:58:32,717
It's like, uh,

1255
01:58:32,718 --> 01:58:36,889
the story of Chuang-tzu
and the butterfly.

1256
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:39,392
The story of Chuang-tzu
and the butterfly?

1257
01:58:39,393 --> 01:58:40,492
Yes.

1258
01:58:42,462 --> 01:58:46,498
A king who was dreaming
that he was a butterfly

1259
01:58:46,499 --> 01:58:48,733
that dreamed he was a king,

1260
01:58:48,735 --> 01:58:50,603
who was dreaming
he was a butterfly.

1261
01:58:50,604 --> 01:58:53,371
I know very well
that I'm-

1262
01:58:53,372 --> 01:58:54,639
I'm dreaming,

1263
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:57,709
and in a minute or two
I will wake up.

1264
01:58:57,710 --> 01:59:00,378
<i>You are awake, Cucoane Dominic,</i>

1265
01:59:00,379 --> 01:59:01,914
but you are tired.

1266
01:59:01,915 --> 01:59:04,783
In fact, you look very tired.

1267
01:59:04,784 --> 01:59:05,784
All right.

1268
01:59:05,785 --> 01:59:09,521
Between December the 20th, 1938,

1269
01:59:09,522 --> 01:59:11,623
and this evening,
many things have happened.

1270
01:59:11,624 --> 01:59:14,526
<i>That is when it is happening,
Cucoane Dominic.</i>

1271
01:59:14,527 --> 01:59:17,194
This is December 20th, 1938.

1272
01:59:17,196 --> 01:59:19,431
I don't dare tell you

1273
01:59:19,432 --> 01:59:21,433
what year we are
really living in,

1274
01:59:21,434 --> 01:59:24,568
we who are outside this dream.

1275
01:59:24,569 --> 01:59:27,872
I know that if I were to make
the effort, I would wake up.

1276
01:59:27,873 --> 01:59:30,240
<i>You are not dreaming,
Coane Dominic.</i>

1277
01:59:30,241 --> 01:59:32,543
You're here with us,
your friends.

1278
01:59:32,544 --> 01:59:34,712
You're at the Café Select.

1279
01:59:34,713 --> 01:59:37,382
This is what we imagined
would happen.

1280
01:59:37,383 --> 01:59:40,050
<i>When Conul Dominic
comes to his senses,</i>

1281
01:59:40,051 --> 01:59:43,787
when he recovers,
you'll see.

1282
01:59:43,788 --> 01:59:46,223
He'll go straight
to the Café Select.

1283
01:59:47,725 --> 01:59:49,092
But if I'm not dreaming,

1284
01:59:49,093 --> 01:59:52,129
then you'd know about...

1285
01:59:52,130 --> 01:59:54,295
Hiroshima.

1286
01:59:54,331 --> 01:59:56,632
Of the hydrogen bomb,

1287
01:59:56,633 --> 01:59:57,935
of Neil Armstrong,

1288
01:59:57,936 --> 02:00:01,705
the astronaut who landed

1289
02:00:01,706 --> 02:00:03,207
and walked on the moon...

1290
02:00:04,275 --> 02:00:05,709
...last summer in July.

1291
02:00:07,244 --> 02:00:09,045
Dominic!

1292
02:00:10,214 --> 02:00:12,382
Dominic, it's true.

1293
02:00:12,383 --> 02:00:15,586
You've come back.

1294
02:00:15,587 --> 02:00:17,653
Welcome.

1295
02:00:27,798 --> 02:00:29,399
You look good.

1296
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:32,602
Welcome, old friend.

1297
02:00:32,603 --> 02:00:36,671
It's like that story of, uh,
the Chinese philosopher,

1298
02:00:36,672 --> 02:00:38,975
you know, the one
I've told you about many times.

1299
02:00:38,976 --> 02:00:40,576
Which Chinese philosopher?

1300
02:00:40,577 --> 02:00:44,147
The name escapes me now.

1301
02:00:44,148 --> 02:00:46,181
The one with the butterfly.

1302
02:00:49,485 --> 02:00:51,420
Well, it's too long to repeat.

1303
02:00:51,421 --> 02:00:54,156
I'll call for a sleigh
to take you home.

1304
02:00:54,157 --> 02:00:56,057
I don't need a sleigh.

1305
02:00:57,727 --> 02:00:59,561
I'm going on foot.

1306
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:06,601
The next time
the problem arises,

1307
02:01:06,602 --> 02:01:07,936
I shall know how to answer.

1308
02:01:10,506 --> 02:01:13,107
What problem, dear Dominic?

1309
02:01:18,681 --> 02:01:22,082
The problem which worries
all of us.

1310
02:01:26,089 --> 02:01:28,090
Dominic?

1311
02:01:28,091 --> 02:01:29,891
Is it your teeth?

1312
02:01:29,892 --> 02:01:32,159
Is it your teeth? Dominic?

1313
02:01:49,111 --> 02:01:51,312
Should I lock up
the door?

1314
02:01:51,313 --> 02:01:53,781
The guest in Room 19
hasn't come back yet.

1315
02:01:53,782 --> 02:01:55,416
He went to the Café Select.

1316
02:01:55,417 --> 02:01:56,984
I'll call.

1317
02:01:59,754 --> 02:02:02,189
Yes, he came here.

1318
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:04,190
He went into the backroom.

1319
02:02:04,191 --> 02:02:05,892
Uh, no one was there,

1320
02:02:05,893 --> 02:02:07,660
so he stayed only
a few minutes

1321
02:02:07,661 --> 02:02:10,029
and left without
saying good night.

1322
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:12,964
He was, uh, holding
his hand to his mouth.

1323
02:03:26,873 --> 02:03:28,806
<i>And the third?</i>

1324
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,543
<i>Where do you want me to put</i>

1325
02:03:32,544 --> 02:03:35,479
<i>the third rose?</i>
