2
00:02:57,207 --> 00:03:01,576
I feel great, man.
I get it. You live in an armpit.

3
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:04,614
What is so wrong with this town, huh?

4
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:07,082
Besides archaic beliefs
and backward mentality?

5
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,119
Hey, come on, I like it here.

6
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:11,017
- Sean?
- What?

7
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:16,082
We're almost drunk.
Can we have a little more booze, please?

8
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:20,528
- That's all.
- You're the best.

9
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,034
So you're just gonna stare at her
through plate glass all night?

10
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:27,468
She doesn't want to talk.

11
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:30,405
- I can tell by her posture.
- Pos...

12
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:36,678
Did you see that?

13
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:47,724
Eden.

14
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,521
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

15
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:53,358
No, it started raining.

16
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,799
- You and Eric will work everything out.
- Oh, yeah? How's that?

17
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:01,736
Hm... I have a feeling
for these kind of things.

18
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:24,592
Have some.

19
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,962
Hey, Ray.
How are you doing tonight?

20
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:43,540
- All right, I guess.
- Got your order all ready.

21
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:54,853
Here you go, Ray.
Have a good one.

22
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,562
- That man gives me the weebies.
- It's just a scar, Rachel.

23
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:04,294
Forget the scar.
It's his eyes, the way he stares you down.

24
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:06,199
Freaky.

25
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:04,160
So tell me, is that synthetic leather?

26
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:07,156
We got it at Lacey's in Baton Rouge.

27
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:12,134
<i>You</i> got it at Lacey's. I was in Barnes and
Noble. Do not make me part of your felony.

28
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:15,933
- You stole it?
- Well, I wasn't gonna buy it. It's too ugly.

29
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:18,873
And I felt bad taking a nice one.
I have a conscience.

30
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:22,036
- You're still a crook.
- Yeah, a crook with a nice rack.

31
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:24,808
Don't you think?

32
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,484
You may not want
to pull those out too often.

33
00:06:29,553 --> 00:06:32,021
- Ray!
- What are you doing? Stop!

34
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:34,216
- Ray! Hey, Ray!
- Tammy!

35
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:38,352
- Yeah, you like that?
- Tammy! That redneck ain't right.

36
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:41,397
So long, sucker!

37
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,107
- Come on.
- You're not touching my hair.

38
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:03,675
What?
You don't trust me? I'm offended.

39
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:08,816
Mitzi said if I get my license, she'll give me
a chair and I can build up my clientele.

40
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:11,918
Mitzi will have to die
before you get a clientele.

41
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:16,056
She rolls around on a stool now, cutting
hair and doing color. It will not be long.

42
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,124
I can wait.

43
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:22,335
- That's getting embarrassing.
- Tuition, car payment.

44
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:24,670
Tuition, car payment.

45
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,936
"Who's the scrub on the bike?"

46
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,808
"Oh, that's Dr. Sinclair.
She clips coupons, too."

47
00:07:30,314 --> 00:07:33,408
- Good night, Rachel.
- Good night, Eden.

48
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,845
Eden.

49
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:12,279
Eden, come on.

50
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:27,859
- What's going on?
- You broke up with me, Eric.

51
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,399
What are you talking about?
You broke up with me.

52
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:33,129
I said we should
get serious about me going away.

53
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:34,727
Yeah, to LSU, not Columbia.

54
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:37,000
The grants came through.
What was I meant to do?

55
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:41,773
How about telling me
you applied to Columbia in the first place?

56
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,710
I knew you'd get upset.

57
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,910
Oh, so you'd announce one day, "Oh, by
the way, I'm going to school in New York."

58
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:52,148
Not Baton Rouge like we'd planned. We
were gonna see each other on weekends.

59
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:56,181
There is nothing here for me.
I mean, you have your dad's business.

60
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:58,557
Be realistic.
I'm gonna have to move away.

61
00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:00,892
Listen.
You can't be a doctor here?

62
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:03,432
I don't want this town.

63
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,199
Are you sure?

64
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,265
Or is it me you don't want?

65
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,415
Great.

66
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:33,086
Everything OK here?

67
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:38,100
Actually, Ray, we're kind of in the middle
of something, you know? Private.

68
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:41,262
- Is this boy giving you trouble?
- No.

69
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:45,138
No, Ray, it's OK.
We're just talking.

70
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:48,840
Bridge ain't nowhere to park a car, boy.

71
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:52,348
- Use some sense.
- Thanks, Ray.

72
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,465
- Jesus!
- Who is it?

73
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:22,137
- It's Cece's grandmother.
- See what you've done?

74
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:25,670
- You were on the wrong side of the road.
- Look where your car is!

75
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:30,015
Both of you just shut up. She just moved.
Miss Emmie, are you OK?

76
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:32,179
Eric, no!

77
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:34,018
Ray! Help us!

78
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,887
Get out of the way.

79
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:43,230
- I'll take hold of her and pass her off, OK?
- OK.

80
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:58,774
It's OK. I got you.

81
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:00,840
The suitcase.

82
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:06,289
The suitcase, please.

83
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:09,348
You must... Oh, please...

84
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:12,354
Please... you must...

85
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:18,129
- It's OK. It's OK.
- You must...

86
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:20,032
You must...

87
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:22,398
OK. It's OK.

88
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:34,277
It's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be OK.

89
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:36,319
- What are you doing?
- Give me a second.

90
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:41,688
- Come on, Ray. Get the hell out of the car.
- It's OK, kid.

91
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:44,249
Please, just stay...

92
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:55,428
Ray!

93
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:58,235
Ray! No!

94
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:03,068
Ray! Ray!

95
00:13:03,146 --> 00:13:04,704
- No!
- Eric, no!

96
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:15,750
Fuck!

97
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:38,478
Oh, my God.

98
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,521
Get me up to speed.
What's going on?

99
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:54,051
Junior and the man got him out.

100
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,794
But they can't do much
about the car until the tide drops.

101
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:04,168
Jesus.

102
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,107
Something got a hold of him good
down there.

103
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:09,202
Messed him up real bad.

104
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,009
Damn swamp's full of snakes.

105
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:14,414
Check this out.

106
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:20,354
They retrieved it from the car.

107
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:24,683
What is that?

108
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,294
Some kind of Veve.

109
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:31,857
Old-time Creole.

110
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,234
My granddaddy
got stories about that woman.

111
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:37,136
Keep you up nights.

112
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:41,638
Look here. I want this bridge secured
and this road cleared.

113
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:44,373
Hold on, now.
My day off started two hours ago.

114
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:49,384
- How am I supposed to tow a tow truck?
- Goddammit, boy, hop to it.

115
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:51,249
Shit.

116
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,134
It was an accident, Eric.

117
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:10,137
They're both dead.

118
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:17,042
I should have gone in.
I should have tried to save him.

119
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:20,514
So what?
That you could have drowned too?

120
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:24,244
I should have done something.

121
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:28,851
Sheriff!

122
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:32,281
- Was there a suitcase?
- I'm sorry, child?

123
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:34,323
Was there a suitcase in the car?

124
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,756
Yeah, there was.
We pulled it out. It was empty.

125
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,987
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

126
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,927
Cece, are you OK?

127
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:44,091
- What happened?
- It was an accident.

128
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,601
What happened to Ray?
They said he was in the car.

129
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:49,069
The car went in the water.

130
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,834
He drowned.

131
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:52,636
Is that true?

132
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:57,237
Either that or the swamp snakes got him.
We don't know for sure.

133
00:16:57,313 --> 00:16:59,042
Oh, my God.

134
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:01,583
I need to go to my grandma's house.

135
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:04,984
- Take me to my grandma's house.
- You don't want to be there alone.

136
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:09,150
Please, please. My dad, he's in Biloxi.
He'll be there till Sunday.

137
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:13,025
Can you please just take me
to my grandmother's house?

138
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:16,327
All right. I'll take you.

139
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:28,738
Snakes.

140
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:30,676
I'm telling you.

141
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:36,378
I don't know, some damn swamp snakes
chewed his ass up.

142
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:39,353
I swear to Jesus. It's a mess.

143
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:45,918
I ain't seen nothing like this
since old man Hardy died in that mill fire.

144
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,063
Hold on a second.

145
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:42,549
Sorry about that.
He had a death rattle.

146
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:47,989
Well, Hank don't get in
till noon tomorrow.

147
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:53,860
I'm sorry, honey pie.

148
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,194
Yeah, me too.

149
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:00,693
Bye, girl.

150
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,601
Bye.

151
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:13,279
Jesus Christ.

152
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:54,942
Four years out of the academy
and he's giving me this bullshit.

153
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,612
Jesus!

154
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:00,612
Shit!

155
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:04,122
The sheriff is gonna have my ass...

156
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:07,651
<i> You done with that tow truck?</i>
<i>The sheriff's asking for you.</i>

157
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,925
Not now, bitch.

158
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:11,694
Pain in the butt.

159
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:36,855
Hey!

160
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:40,562
All right, now.

161
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,292
Who's in here?

162
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:09,854
Shit.

163
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:17,328
All right, now.

164
00:22:19,435 --> 00:22:22,404
This is Deputy Darrell Turner.

165
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:30,069
I want whoever's out here...

166
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:33,774
to show themselves.

167
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,365
Oh, shit!

168
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:59,269
- Give me the sheriff.
<i>- Turner. Where you at. Boy?</i>

169
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:02,140
Betty, just do what I say.

170
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:04,679
Get me the sheriff right now.

171
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:48,823
- Honey, how are you?
- I'm fine.

172
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:52,827
How'd you sleep?
Oh, thank God you're OK.

173
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:55,921
- What can I get you? Are you hungry?
- No. I'm OK, thank you.

174
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:58,933
- Coffee?
- Sure.

175
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:15,146
- New York?
- Yeah.

176
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:19,779
That sucks. Have you ever been there?
The place smells.

177
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:23,120
I don't know what's going on with her.
She's changed.

178
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:27,288
- It started when her dad got sick.
- Well, she needs to get over that shit.

179
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,171
- About last night...
- Yeah, what?

180
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:49,151
- I'm sorry, you know.
- Will you stop with that, please?

181
00:24:49,218 --> 00:24:52,278
Look around.
The world's a better place without that guy.

182
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:54,050
Come on, this has got to upset you.

183
00:24:54,123 --> 00:24:57,092
No. He was nothing to me, all right?

184
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,152
I mean, I didn't even speak two words
to this guy in my entire life.

185
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,462
He's a redneck piece of shit, he got
my mom drunk, and he left her pregnant.

186
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,968
That doesn't make him my father.

187
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:09,937
Jesus.

188
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:12,372
You know, the guy's dead.

189
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:14,932
When is this town
just gonna shut up about it?

190
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,786
I mean, are you sure it was Ray's tow
truck? Not a pickup, an SUV, a Miata?

191
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:20,886
There's no mistaking that truck.

192
00:28:20,963 --> 00:28:26,060
I don't know what to say.
I mean, it's kind of impossible, Eden.

193
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:31,399
Ray Sawyer was a dick.
I'm sorry. I know he's dead.

194
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:33,839
- Whatever. He's a dead dick.
- You're bad.

195
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:35,706
It was the scar that made him mean.

196
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:38,872
No. He's had that scar
ever since he was a kid, fighting.

197
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:41,473
- Some people are just born rotten.
- Or gay.

198
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,381
- Or bitchy.
- Or bitchy.

199
00:28:44,787 --> 00:28:48,689
Come on, hooker. We got a mall
to knock over. Ricky, you coming or not?

200
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:50,816
No, I've reached my daily limit.

201
00:28:50,893 --> 00:28:54,693
Come on.
I'll drop you off at Abercrombie.

202
00:28:54,763 --> 00:28:57,698
Let's go have some fun.

203
00:28:57,766 --> 00:28:59,495
Do you know about Cece's grandma?

204
00:28:59,568 --> 00:29:05,165
I heard the same stories as you. She was
a big-time mambo priestess or something.

205
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:08,901
What were you doing at the cemetery?

206
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:10,843
I went to see my dad.

207
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:16,147
Look, last night was rough.
It's been a rough year.

208
00:29:16,218 --> 00:29:18,118
Give yourself a break.

209
00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:21,748
- I'm crazy, huh?
- No. I'm the crazy one.

210
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:25,692
Now, I'm off soon.
You are gonna hang out with me today.

211
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:31,757
We're gonna go to the lake and you
are gonna forget about last night. OK?

212
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:52,514
- You don't need air.
- It'll take two seconds.

213
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:55,716
See? It's low.

214
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:59,557
- You're taking a dead man's air.
- Air's free.

215
00:29:59,628 --> 00:30:03,689
- Yeah. I'm gonna pee.
- You're using a dead man's toilet.

216
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:07,031
Oh, I promise to flush and be polite.

217
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:25,548
Hey, Tammy. If you wanted somewhere
to break in and enter, now's your chance.

218
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:29,921
- Will you hurry? We're gonna hit traffic.
- Shut up.

219
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:57,115
Oh.

220
00:30:58,921 --> 00:31:00,684
Ugh!

221
00:31:06,362 --> 00:31:08,159
Patty.

222
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:13,096
Patty, come on.
The mall closes at eight.

223
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:43,826
Patty. Come on, dude.

224
00:31:49,705 --> 00:31:51,730
Hey-hey!

225
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:02,115
Patty!

226
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:06,215
Patty?

227
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:24,569
Patty!

228
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:40,011
Goddammit. Fuck!

229
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:41,386
Patty!

230
00:32:41,457 --> 00:32:43,982
What the fuck?

231
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:04,106
Patty?

232
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:25,792
Agh!

233
00:33:57,332 --> 00:33:59,197
No! No!

234
00:33:59,268 --> 00:34:01,065
No!

235
00:34:15,851 --> 00:34:18,251
Please leave me alone.

236
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:27,723
Please.

237
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,798
Please!

238
00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:36,296
No! No!

239
00:34:39,474 --> 00:34:41,601
Oh, please!

240
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:52,077
No! No, no!

241
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:55,180
No, no, no, no!

242
00:34:55,257 --> 00:34:58,021
Please, no! Please!

243
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:09,770
- More beer!
- You're gonna have to work for it.

244
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:23,740
- You're drunk.
- You're drunk? You didn't have anything.

245
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:26,049
No, <i>you're</i> drunk.

246
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:29,822
I don't know, Eden.

247
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:33,827
I know it doesn't make sense,
but something really weird is going on.

248
00:35:33,895 --> 00:35:38,696
You saw it yourself. When Cece found out
Ray was killed by snakes, she flipped out.

249
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:41,065
Her grandmother just died, Eden.

250
00:35:41,136 --> 00:35:44,435
She was upset.
We're all upset.

251
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:46,701
I think I'm gonna go check up on her.

252
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:49,903
My mom says that Miss Emmie
lived out at the end of Fuller Road,

253
00:35:49,978 --> 00:35:51,673
and she's there all by herself.

254
00:35:51,747 --> 00:35:56,878
Hey, you know, I don't want you to get
all worked up about this voodoo shit.

255
00:35:56,952 --> 00:36:00,888
It's not real.
It's just Louisiana folklore.

256
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:02,548
Yeah, I know.

257
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:04,455
Hey.

258
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:07,620
Are we still fighting?

259
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:14,465
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I swear to God I am not making this up.

260
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,233
- You guys, what's going on?
- The town is upside down.

261
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:21,674
Deputy Turner and Terry Parker
who works at the morgue are missing.

262
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:26,339
And here's the really fucked-up part.
So is Ray Sawyer.

263
00:36:26,415 --> 00:36:30,511
- Ray's dead, Ricky.
- Yeah. That's the really fucked-up part.

264
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:32,610
His body's missing.

265
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:39,154
What the fuck
are you all looking at me for?

266
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:43,857
- Fuck this.
- Sean, where are you going? Sean! Sean!

267
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,027
- I'm gonna go check on Cece.
- Eric, stop him. He's drunk.

268
00:36:55,277 --> 00:36:57,142
Sean!

269
00:36:57,212 --> 00:37:00,477
What are you doing, man?
You can't drive like this.

270
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:03,279
He's not gonna go away.
He'll never fucking go away.

271
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:05,445
Get off the bike and we'll talk about it.

272
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,011
Oh, fuck this.

273
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:10,217
Drunk fucker.

274
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,364
This is where Cece lives?

275
00:37:50,432 --> 00:37:55,131
No, her grandmother does.
Come on, I think it's this way.

276
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,880
Nice house.

277
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:28,796
The mambo woman
meant business, huh?

278
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,862
All this voodoo shit
weirds me out.

279
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,981
Cece?

280
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,358
Just go in.

281
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:58,362
- What?
- What is that?

282
00:38:58,433 --> 00:39:02,426
- I don't know.
- I don't like it.

283
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:13,579
Cece?

284
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:23,189
I don't think she's here.

285
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:25,522
Check this out.

286
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:34,595
- What's it supposed to be?
- I don't know.

287
00:39:34,669 --> 00:39:37,365
It's a milking ceremony.

288
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:41,074
It's an old Haitian ritual.

289
00:39:41,142 --> 00:39:45,579
The mambo's saving the man's soul,
cleansing him of his evil.

290
00:39:46,414 --> 00:39:48,041
It's his last rites.

291
00:39:48,116 --> 00:39:51,574
The snakes
are charmed by the mambo.

292
00:39:51,653 --> 00:39:54,053
They suck out the man's evil...

293
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:57,591
so that his soul may pass on.

294
00:40:03,231 --> 00:40:05,756
What are you guys doing here?

295
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:08,166
We need to talk.

296
00:40:35,897 --> 00:40:39,424
Guess
this is all mine now, huh?

297
00:40:39,501 --> 00:40:41,059
You know what I'm gonna do?

298
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:44,902
I've been thinking about this.
I think I'm gonna repaint this place.

299
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:46,736
Yeah, spruce it up a bit.

300
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:50,266
Bring the business back
to the Happy Time gas station.

301
00:40:50,345 --> 00:40:54,509
What do you think, like a light blue,
maybe? A sunny yellow, perhaps?

302
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:57,211
Something real happy, right?

303
00:40:57,285 --> 00:40:59,845
Come on, Sean.
I'll take you home.

304
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:01,582
So how do I look?

305
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:04,716
Do I look like
I'm gonna be a good gas pumper, huh?

306
00:41:05,393 --> 00:41:09,261
'Course, I'm gonna have to get myself
a tattoo, right? And a big scar.

307
00:41:09,331 --> 00:41:13,165
'Cause if I'm gonna be the new town freak,
I gotta do it all the way, correct?

308
00:41:16,638 --> 00:41:19,334
Hear that?

309
00:41:21,643 --> 00:41:23,338
So what do you think, man?

310
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:27,313
Do you think I got what it takes? Huh?
Do I got what it takes?

311
00:41:27,382 --> 00:41:30,146
Are people gonna come through here
and ring my bell?

312
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:33,710
Huh? Are they gonna ring my bell?
You think they'll come through?

313
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:36,780
- Don't do this, man.
- Don't do what?

314
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:40,988
Yeah, don't worry, Dad.
I'll make you real fucking proud.

315
00:41:42,297 --> 00:41:45,698
Sean! Sean, come on, man!

316
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:49,801
Sean, stop it!

317
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,703
- Get the fuck off me!
- Come on.

318
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:17,057
Oh, shit!

319
00:42:48,596 --> 00:42:51,565
This is some weird shit.

320
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:53,897
I don't like it.

321
00:43:03,878 --> 00:43:06,972
When did Ray's body go missing?

322
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:12,714
I don't know, but I think I saw
his truck this morning at the cemetery.

323
00:43:20,095 --> 00:43:23,121
Who else is missing?

324
00:43:23,198 --> 00:43:25,496
Terry who works at the morgue...

325
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,559
and Deputy Turner.

326
00:43:28,636 --> 00:43:31,036
What's going on, Cece?

327
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:45,878
It's a voodoo temple.

328
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:50,391
Grandma was a mambo,
like her mother before her.

329
00:43:52,861 --> 00:43:55,261
It's in our blood, Eden.

330
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:04,366
For generations,
people would come here to worship.

331
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:08,034
It's a religion, like any other.

332
00:44:08,109 --> 00:44:11,601
It's full of spirits - both good and evil.

333
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:17,044
They're called loas.

334
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,518
Grandma helped a lot of people here.

335
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:23,648
She was a good woman.

336
00:44:25,026 --> 00:44:27,961
Your grandmother was wearing this.

337
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:33,324
It's a baka.

338
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:36,464
It's a charm that protects against evil.

339
00:44:38,706 --> 00:44:41,971
What was she doing
out so late last night?

340
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:48,244
You know over in Cypress,
where they're building that new mill?

341
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:51,513
There's an old Creole burial ground there.

342
00:44:51,586 --> 00:44:54,953
She was afraid of what
someone might find if they started digging.

343
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:57,253
The suitcase?

344
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:02,127
Grandma saved souls.

345
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:06,759
Murderers,

346
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:09,395
sadists,

347
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,802
the most vile men.

348
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,139
She milked them of evil.

349
00:45:17,045 --> 00:45:18,979
What was in that suitcase, Cece?

350
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:23,347
Every soul that she ever milked...

351
00:45:23,418 --> 00:45:25,318
was inside that suitcase.

352
00:45:26,154 --> 00:45:29,783
So if those snakes got set free
and if they killed Ray,

353
00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:34,795
the evil of countless souls
is inside of him right now...

354
00:45:35,864 --> 00:45:39,061
possessing his body.

355
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:42,296
You're really
starting to scare me, Cece.

356
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:47,232
You said it yourself.
You saw his truck outside the cemetery.

357
00:45:47,308 --> 00:45:52,336
Now his only instinct will be to kill
and to sacrifice to the dark loas.

358
00:45:52,413 --> 00:45:55,473
Nobody's safe, Eden.

359
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,415
Nobody's safe.

360
00:46:00,955 --> 00:46:03,423
Should we go now?

361
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:07,860
She's really out of it. I mean, she's saying
some weird stuff. I think she needs help.

362
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:11,456
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, but there's no phone here.

363
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:15,696
- Do you have your cell?
- Like we're gonna have reception here?

364
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:19,262
Listen. You guys need to go to my house,
get my mom and bring her here.

365
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,672
Call the sheriff.
Make sure he gets here too.

366
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:24,143
What is going on, Eden?

367
00:46:24,212 --> 00:46:26,578
I don't know, OK?
Just hurry.

368
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:28,912
I'll stay with Cece.

369
00:46:28,983 --> 00:46:30,746
Let's go.

370
00:46:30,985 --> 00:46:32,816
Let's go.

371
00:46:43,298 --> 00:46:47,359
- I sent Rachel and Ricky for help.
- You should've gone too.

372
00:46:47,435 --> 00:46:49,767
Grandma's dead.

373
00:46:49,837 --> 00:46:54,274
I'm the only descendant left.
Ray Sawyer will come here.

374
00:46:54,342 --> 00:46:58,802
He'll want me dead,
and he will kill anyone in his path.

375
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,179
- You need help, Cece.
- There is no help.

376
00:47:03,785 --> 00:47:08,484
You saw Ray at the cemetery because
he needs a sacred place to worship.

377
00:47:08,556 --> 00:47:14,620
Reaping the souls of all that he kills
is his only purpose now.

378
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:17,188
And he won't stop.

379
00:47:24,772 --> 00:47:27,707
- Did you hear that?
- What?

380
00:47:34,148 --> 00:47:35,945
It's nothing.

381
00:47:36,017 --> 00:47:38,417
Come on, come on.

382
00:47:43,257 --> 00:47:45,657
What the fuck?

383
00:47:48,162 --> 00:47:51,563
My fucking car!
I can't believe this.

384
00:47:56,004 --> 00:48:01,203
- That's what the bottom of a car looks like.
- I don't think that's funny.

385
00:48:06,814 --> 00:48:09,749
Is that Ray's truck?

386
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:20,018
What was that?

387
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:23,562
I don't know.

388
00:48:45,653 --> 00:48:48,213
Rachel.

389
00:48:51,926 --> 00:48:53,188
Rachel, go! Go!

390
00:48:55,496 --> 00:48:58,465
Don't go out there.
Don't go out there!

391
00:48:59,233 --> 00:49:01,394
Eden!

392
00:49:03,337 --> 00:49:07,706
- What's going on?
- It's Ray! It's Ray Sawyer!

393
00:49:07,775 --> 00:49:08,867
Oh, my God.

394
00:49:08,943 --> 00:49:11,878
Run! Run! Hurry!

395
00:49:11,946 --> 00:49:14,380
Run!

396
00:49:16,317 --> 00:49:18,182
- Rachel!
- Come on!

397
00:49:18,252 --> 00:49:20,618
Hurry!

398
00:49:21,122 --> 00:49:22,714
Oh, my God!

399
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:26,786
He's coming!
He's coming!

400
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:30,428
Argh! Argh!

401
00:49:30,498 --> 00:49:32,489
Close the door!

402
00:49:39,173 --> 00:49:42,006
- But we have to help him.
- No! No! Don't go out there.

403
00:49:43,111 --> 00:49:46,342
Argh! Argh!

404
00:49:51,652 --> 00:49:53,779
Aaargh!

405
00:49:55,289 --> 00:49:58,156
Aaaargh! Aaaargh!

406
00:50:04,832 --> 00:50:09,166
- We have to get out of here.
- No. We have to stay here. It's safe here.

407
00:50:09,237 --> 00:50:11,296
- No, it's not safe here!
- Yes, it is!

408
00:50:11,372 --> 00:50:13,499
The house is spelled.
He can't come in.

409
00:50:13,574 --> 00:50:17,840
- Oh, God! Ricky.
- Rachel, it's gonna be OK.

410
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,282
What the hell is he doing?

411
00:50:48,543 --> 00:50:51,512
How... how can he be alive?

412
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:55,140
We need a gun.
Did your grandmother have a gun?

413
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:57,741
- It won't help.
- Where's the fucking gun?

414
00:50:57,818 --> 00:51:00,844
I don't know.
The bedroom.

415
00:51:04,058 --> 00:51:06,390
Rachel.

416
00:51:06,894 --> 00:51:08,122
We're safe here.

417
00:51:08,196 --> 00:51:11,029
You're kidding, right?
Did you see that fucking thing?

418
00:51:11,098 --> 00:51:13,498
This house has been blessed.

419
00:51:13,568 --> 00:51:17,334
- It's protected against evil.
- Fucking great.

420
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:21,341
I'm glad your grandma hexed the house
when she should have installed a phone.

421
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,287
Jesus.

422
00:51:39,594 --> 00:51:44,588
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know. Come on, come on.

423
00:51:54,508 --> 00:51:56,476
Holy shit.

424
00:51:57,511 --> 00:52:00,071
Oh. Eden!

425
00:52:08,189 --> 00:52:09,884
Eric, get inside!

426
00:52:09,957 --> 00:52:11,948
Sean! Run!

427
00:52:12,026 --> 00:52:13,891
Get inside, Eric!

428
00:52:13,961 --> 00:52:16,953
Sean, come on!
Come on!

429
00:52:19,934 --> 00:52:22,698
- Tell me that wasn't Ray Sawyer.
- He killed Ricky.

430
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:26,171
It's OK. We're safe in here.
We're safe, right?

431
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,800
The altar room will be safest.

432
00:52:29,343 --> 00:52:31,743
- That thing can't be Ray.
- It's Ray, Sean.

433
00:52:31,812 --> 00:52:34,246
Yeah, but Ray's dead.

434
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:36,078
Sean!

435
00:52:36,317 --> 00:52:37,944
Sean!

436
00:52:38,686 --> 00:52:41,348
Sean, no!

437
00:52:44,158 --> 00:52:47,150
No! He's baiting you.
Don't go out there. Don't go!

438
00:52:56,404 --> 00:52:59,840
Sean! No! Sean!

439
00:53:01,742 --> 00:53:05,007
Get up! Come on! Come on!

440
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:07,570
Come on!

441
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,349
Eden, it's OK.

442
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:22,086
It's OK. Eden.

443
00:53:22,163 --> 00:53:24,859
You got him.

444
00:53:24,932 --> 00:53:27,162
You fucking got him.

445
00:53:28,736 --> 00:53:30,863
No!

446
00:53:35,543 --> 00:53:37,408
Sean! No!

447
00:53:39,013 --> 00:53:42,176
- No!
- Sean!

448
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,820
Oh, my God!

449
00:53:50,024 --> 00:53:52,891
- Sean! Sean!
Sean! Sean!

450
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,394
Come on, come on.

451
00:54:02,303 --> 00:54:05,761
Oh, my God! We need
to stop the bleeding! Get something!

452
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,774
Hurry up!

453
00:54:08,309 --> 00:54:10,709
Hurry up!

454
00:54:10,778 --> 00:54:13,269
Hurry up!

455
00:54:13,347 --> 00:54:16,009
It's not stopping!

456
00:54:16,617 --> 00:54:18,380
Sean! Sean! Sean!

457
00:54:18,452 --> 00:54:21,751
Help him, please!

458
00:54:21,822 --> 00:54:25,121
Please! Please!

459
00:54:25,926 --> 00:54:27,860
Fuck!

460
00:55:00,528 --> 00:55:02,758
He's just standing there.

461
00:55:22,883 --> 00:55:25,613
How do we stop that thing, Cece?

462
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:30,413
With the baka.

463
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:38,894
Grandma says it has power over the evil,
but without her, I don't know.

464
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:41,332
- It's impossible.
- No.

465
00:55:41,402 --> 00:55:43,233
There has to be another way.

466
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:47,900
You know this voodoo stuff. Can't you, like,
demilk him with a ritual or something?

467
00:55:47,975 --> 00:55:49,875
That's real mambo work.

468
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:53,880
I only know the little things,
like dolls and spells and...

469
00:55:54,982 --> 00:55:58,042
I can't.

470
00:56:01,355 --> 00:56:03,220
He's gone again.

471
00:56:04,558 --> 00:56:06,890
He didn't go far.

472
00:56:07,995 --> 00:56:11,829
- I can make a doll.
- A doll? What would that do?

473
00:56:11,899 --> 00:56:15,460
The evil is inside Ray's body.
I can't stop that.

474
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:19,529
But maybe I can stop his body
long enough for us to get out of here.

475
00:56:19,607 --> 00:56:23,043
- It's worth a try.
- Are you talking about a voodoo doll?

476
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,206
If I had something of Ray's,
like some hair or some clothing,

477
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:30,273
some actual part of him,
I could make a doll...

478
00:56:30,351 --> 00:56:34,344
So who's gonna go outside
and pull a lock of hair?

479
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:41,628
- Will blood work?
- What are you talking about?

480
00:56:41,695 --> 00:56:44,823
Sean's his son.
Ray's blood is running through him.

481
00:56:44,899 --> 00:56:47,390
That would work, right?

482
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:49,527
Blood works best.

483
00:56:49,603 --> 00:56:53,835
Eden, what the fuck are you talking about?
You can't be serious.

484
00:56:57,311 --> 00:56:59,871
What do we have to do?

485
00:57:00,948 --> 00:57:03,473
Help me move his body
into the altar room.

486
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:06,315
- What are you doing?!
- Trying to get us out of here.

487
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:09,515
By doing what?!
Making a human voodoo doll?

488
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:13,117
- Eden, we can't do this.
- He's dead, OK?

489
00:57:13,193 --> 00:57:15,991
- We will be too if we don't do something.
- It's wrong.

490
00:57:16,063 --> 00:57:19,658
What part of that thing
did you guys not see out there?

491
00:57:19,733 --> 00:57:22,167
I won't let you.

492
00:57:22,236 --> 00:57:24,966
If there's a chance that this can work...

493
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,201
the smallest chance...

494
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:42,281
Rachel.

495
00:57:42,356 --> 00:57:45,086
Help me make him more comfortable.

496
00:57:57,671 --> 00:58:02,301
Take this oil,
rub it on the temple of his forehead.

497
00:58:02,376 --> 00:58:04,867
Sprinkle this around his hands and feet.

498
00:58:04,945 --> 00:58:08,938
- What is it?
- Kempelan. It's blessing powder.

499
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,989
Go to the altar, and light all
of the green candles and three red ones.

500
00:58:27,368 --> 00:58:29,836
God help us, what are we doing?

501
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:34,299
I don't even know anymore.

502
00:59:08,275 --> 00:59:11,574
You're not gonna
stick pins in him, are you?

503
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:19,919
Oh.

504
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:24,651
I won't be a part of this.

505
00:59:24,725 --> 00:59:27,319
Let's... let's go to the other room.

506
00:59:42,976 --> 00:59:45,137
Are you OK?

507
00:59:52,986 --> 00:59:55,750
Follow me and do what I do.

508
01:00:36,563 --> 01:00:38,724
What's that?

509
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,977
Shit.

510
01:00:56,316 --> 01:00:57,647
Watch out!

511
01:01:18,238 --> 01:01:19,330
Come on!

512
01:01:21,842 --> 01:01:23,605
Come on! Come on!

513
01:01:28,682 --> 01:01:31,173
Cece, are you OK?

514
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:33,116
Ow.

515
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:37,819
Come on, Cece!

516
01:01:37,891 --> 01:01:40,883
Give me the knife! Give me the knife!
Hurry! Quick!

517
01:01:43,597 --> 01:01:46,691
- It's working!
- Do it again! Do it again!

518
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,161
Cece!

519
01:01:54,107 --> 01:01:56,871
Oh, my God.

520
01:02:01,915 --> 01:02:03,280
Fuck!

521
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,749
Eden!

522
01:02:05,419 --> 01:02:07,284
Cece!

523
01:02:07,354 --> 01:02:08,685
No!

524
01:02:14,261 --> 01:02:15,558
Eden!

525
01:02:15,796 --> 01:02:17,491
Eden!

526
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:19,792
Eden!

527
01:02:19,867 --> 01:02:22,836
- Come on. Come on.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

528
01:02:29,443 --> 01:02:31,172
Is he coming?

529
01:02:33,714 --> 01:02:36,274
I don't know.

530
01:02:39,219 --> 01:02:41,084
God.

531
01:02:45,926 --> 01:02:47,917
He won't stop coming!

532
01:02:49,396 --> 01:02:51,694
- Go faster!
- Hurry!

533
01:03:02,409 --> 01:03:04,400
Faster, Eric!

534
01:03:07,781 --> 01:03:09,874
Faster! Go faster!

535
01:03:10,751 --> 01:03:13,083
Come on, go faster!

536
01:03:13,487 --> 01:03:15,318
- Shit!

537
01:03:21,261 --> 01:03:22,922
Rachel!

538
01:03:25,165 --> 01:03:27,099
Do something!

539
01:03:28,268 --> 01:03:30,532
Get me down!

540
01:03:30,604 --> 01:03:31,901
Shit!

541
01:03:37,411 --> 01:03:39,276
Keep it steady!

542
01:03:41,548 --> 01:03:42,981
Rachel!

543
01:03:45,986 --> 01:03:47,749
No! No! No!

544
01:03:47,821 --> 01:03:49,482
Rachel!

545
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:02,158
Oh, my God.

546
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:17,645
We have to go. Go!

547
01:04:30,864 --> 01:04:32,991
Oh, shit!

548
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:36,231
She's dead. They're all dead. I can't...

549
01:04:36,303 --> 01:04:40,797
No, no, no, no! Eden, listen to me.
Listen, we have to keep moving. OK?

550
01:04:40,874 --> 01:04:45,004
We're gonna get through this. You and me
together. I'm going with you to New York.

551
01:04:45,078 --> 01:04:47,410
Fuck this town.

552
01:04:49,182 --> 01:04:51,241
Shit. Come on! Go, go!

553
01:04:51,318 --> 01:04:53,309
Come on!

554
01:04:54,221 --> 01:04:55,848
Come on!

555
01:05:10,203 --> 01:05:12,228
Eden.

556
01:05:15,575 --> 01:05:17,372
Come on.

557
01:05:17,444 --> 01:05:19,435
Come on. Come on.

558
01:05:45,405 --> 01:05:47,873
Where is he?

559
01:05:47,941 --> 01:05:50,637
Where'd he go?

560
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:53,076
OK. Come on.

561
01:06:03,156 --> 01:06:04,623
Eric!

562
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,585
I'm OK.

563
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:21,333
Run! Run!

564
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:32,808
Eric?

565
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,091
Eric?

566
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:48,430
Eric?

567
01:06:49,736 --> 01:06:51,567
Eric?

568
01:06:54,941 --> 01:06:56,966
Shit.

569
01:08:26,366 --> 01:08:29,233
Oh, no.

570
01:12:14,961 --> 01:12:16,986
Fuck you!

571
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:54,797
Keys. Keys. Fuck.

572
01:16:56,943 --> 01:16:58,205
Start.

573
01:16:58,277 --> 01:17:00,336
Start. OK.

574
01:17:00,413 --> 01:17:01,607
Yes.

575
01:17:04,217 --> 01:17:06,082
Come on. Come on!
