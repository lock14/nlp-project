1
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,460
We'll speak about the art of killing.

2
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,340
...one has to kill well.

3
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,020
A bad kill disgraces the man
and the bull.

4
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,060
A bullfighter must honour
his name, 'matador'...

5
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,700
and mustn't betray the
bull's courage.

6
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,220
The bullfighter watches the bull
and knows how to lead it.

7
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,900
He knows which horn it will use.

8
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,660
A good thrust is the result of
a great job, and in any great job...

9
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,300
there's a time when the bull asks
to be killed...

10
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,340
expecting his death.

11
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,340
The sword, according to the rules,
must be sunk behind the nape...

12
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,940
in the 'cross', between
the shoulder-blades.

13
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,740
This hole is called the
cleft of the clods.

14
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,660
The sword must be neither flat
nor straight but well directed...

15
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,980
to sink into the heart and lungs.

16
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,820
There are three basic ways
to face the kill.

17
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,740
The first one is to kill
when receiving.

18
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,300
To kill, the arm must be straight...

19
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,980
the sword must prolong the arm...

20
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,940
the hand must be level
with the heart.

21
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,980
On sinking the sword,
make the 'cross'...

22
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,700
for he who does not
is taken by the devil.

23
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,780
Slowly, we move the cape
to the bull's muzzle...

24
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,060
and bring it towards us.

25
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,620
Then, still looking
at the muzzle...

26
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,260
we sink the sword in the 'cross'.

27
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,380
But don't think that's all
because to kill it as it deserves...

28
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,140
not only must we use the sword
but also the heart.

29
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,900
Don't you undress?
- I'm not wearing anything.

30
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,500
You worked well today.

31
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,620
Maestro, we want a bull.
- So do I.

32
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,300
It's not our fault you're lame.

33
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,140
We're throwing a party tonight.
It'll be wild.

34
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,980
Want to come?
- No, not tonight.

35
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,940
The man's dead beat.

36
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,860
Those chicks want a good time.

37
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,220
We should go out one night
and see what we find.

38
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,220
Why? Don't you dare on your own?
- I've never tired to.

39
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,980
You've never been with a chick?
- No, never.

40
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,100
Chicks are just like bulls...

41
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,860
You've got to hem them in,
then it's easy.

42
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,260
Give it to me.
- But why?

43
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,860
I was going to fry it with garlic.
- It's amanita mascaria.

44
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,260
What is it?
- They're poisonous.

45
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,540
How do you know?

46
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,140
Because of the hood and the cap.

47
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,020
Pick them up and throw them out.
They're very dangerous.

48
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,940
I watched you while
I was speaking of killing.

49
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,340
You felt sick.

50
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,460
Clouds make me dizzy.

51
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,580
Could I have a glass
of water for a pill?

52
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,740
Yes, let's go upstairs. But pills won't
make you any less frightened.

53
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,580
Death doesn't scare me,
my own least of all.

54
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,540
Fear is good, at times
it gives you courage.

55
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,300
Were you scared?
- Yes, but fear is part of the game.

56
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,220
You mustn't be afraid of fear.

57
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,300
Your girl?  - It's Ava Gardner!
Don't you go to the movies?

58
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,980
No, my family is from the Opus Dei.

59
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,180
I've spent my life praying
and exercising.

60
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,620
I know her.
- Do you?

61
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,300
She's my neighbour.

62
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,820
Do you like her?
- She's very pretty...

63
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,940
but being a model,
she's stuck up.

64
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,580
No, she isn't, not Eva.
- You know her name.

65
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,460
She's my girlfriend.
- That's funny!

66
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,020
Listen, how about a game?
- All right.

67
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,340
You're really successful
with girls, aren't you?

68
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,940
Knowing I was a bullfighter
turns them on.

69
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,060
Why do you want to be a bullfighter?
You're not like the other kids.

70
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,900
Well... I don't know.

71
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,140
I suppose I like danger.

72
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,100
I mean, if you've got to die...

73
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,100
I want to do it in the ring,
it's more exciting.

74
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,580
Don't you think so?

75
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,780
You're too young to think about that.

76
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,500
Age doesn't matter.

77
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,700
At your age, one thinks
about killing... not dying.

78
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,940
Your turn.

79
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,980
To tell the truth, I can't play.

80
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,140
Besides, I told my mother
I'd be home early.

81
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,300
Angel... You don't happen
to like men, do you?

82
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,500
Why do you have to ask me that?

83
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,300
It just came to mind. At your age
a boy has been with a woman.

84
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,060
Always my age! I'm sick of
being taken for a moron!

85
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,340
Just forget it.
- I'll show you I'm no fairy.

86
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,660
But I believe you.
- I'll show you!

87
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,140
What are you doing in the dark?

88
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,740
I don't like you to lock yourself in.

89
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,540
Where are you going?
- For some air.

90
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,180
Open the window.
- I won't be long.

91
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,460
Don't forget that we eat in an hour.

92
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,020
Chicks are like bulls...

93
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,660
You've got to hem them in,
then it's easy.

94
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,220
What's going on?

95
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,380
I'm sorry.

96
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,340
Motherfucker!

97
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,180
Why don't you shower?

98
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
Come on, hurry up!

99
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,140
Stop admiring yourself!

100
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,140
The money I spend on stockings!

101
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,740
Oh Lord, bless the chicken soup...

102
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,300
the sole meunière...

103
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,020
and the custard which
we are about to partake.

104
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,460
You're a disaster.

105
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,620
Did anyone see you fall down?

106
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,020
I don't know, I didn't look.

107
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,700
By the way... when will you see
your spiritual director?

108
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,020
I don't know.

109
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,180
It was one of the conditions
of living in this house...

110
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,820
or had you forgotten?

111
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,580
What are you waiting for? You haven't
been to church in two months.

112
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,780
This is not a boarding-house.

113
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,260
There are rules.

114
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,100
I will not subsidize
a life of luxury and dissipation.

115
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,660
If you do not take the right path,
I prefer not to see you.

116
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,340
Loneliness does not scare me
because I'll never be alone.

117
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,340
What is it? Do I bore you?
- No, I was thinking.

118
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,220
About what?

119
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,140
Nothing... About the storm.

120
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,620
The storm! You certainly are stormy!

121
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,820
At times I think you're crazy, like
your father, may he rest in peace.

122
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,100
I think I'm crazy.

123
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,500
You do?

124
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,300
You should take me
to a psychiatrist.

125
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,540
You don't need a psychiatrist,
you need your spiritual director.

126
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,180
You'll go and see him tomorrow.
Now eat.

127
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,580
Eat, I said.

128
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,860
Allow us to experience, Lord,
on receiving the Eucharist...

129
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,180
peace of the spirit and the body,
through Jesus, our Lord.

130
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,460
The Lord be with you.
- And with your spirit.

131
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:29,780
May the blessing of
the Almighty be upon you.

132
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,940
You may go in peace.
- The Lord be blessed.

133
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,580
Tell him you want to confess.

134
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,500
He'll be pleased.

135
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,260
I'll wait for you at home.

136
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,100
Go on!

137
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,460
Go to the sacristy.
I want to see you go.

138
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,540
Good morning, Father.

139
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,420
Well! At last, you're back!

140
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,180
We've missed you.

141
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,300
Father, I want to confess.

142
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Good, I'm glad to hear that, my son.

143
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,620
Wait for me outside.

144
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,980
What do you want?

145
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,580
To see the inspector.
- What for?

146
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,980
I want to admit to raping a girl.

147
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,220
Some girls have all the luck!

148
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,660
There's the inspector,
holding a picture.

149
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,980
Thank you.

150
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,940
Come in.

151
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,140
Well, what is it?

152
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,340
I came to report a rape.

153
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,140
You were raped?

154
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,740
No, I was the rapist.

155
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,060
Are you sure?

156
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,300
Come in, tell me all about it.

157
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,820
Coming!

158
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,940
It smells good.
- It's paint.

159
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,940
What do you want?
- Police.

160
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,060
I can see that.
- Does Eva Soler live here?

161
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,660
She does. Why?

162
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,740
She was raped last night.
We caught the rapist.

163
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,220
My daughter? I doubt it very much.

164
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,460
She'd have told me.
Better luck next time.

165
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,340
One moment, Madam.
Somebody's coming.

166
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,300
What is it?
- Nothing. Go to your room.

167
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,740
What about her face?
Come here.

168
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,620
I slipped in the mud.
- Remember the storm?

169
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,220
He may do it again
if you protect him.

170
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,900
First of all, he didn't rape me.

171
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,700
And if he tries again,
I'll cut his balls off!

172
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,460
Please come with us.

173
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,540
But look at the state
the house is in!

174
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,380
I'm painting it and
I've got no one to help me.

175
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,660
Please, madam.

176
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,380
I can't, I've got a casting.

177
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,780
We've got a casting
and the house is a mess.

178
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,540
Be quiet!

179
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,540
Don't you scream at me
or you'll be in trouble!

180
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,180
It won't take long.

181
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,980
If you don't mind waiting
while we dress.

182
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,820
You don't want us to go to the
station looking at sight.

183
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,540
The worst isn't getting raped
but having to tell everyone.

184
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,220
Make yourself at home.

185
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,380
I'll close the door.

186
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,740
Please sit down.
- No, we're in a hurry.

187
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,820
Get to the point.

188
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,540
Very well.

189
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,540
Are you Eva Soler?
- Yes, I am.

190
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,500
Do you know Angel Giménez?
- Yes, we're neighbours.

191
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,220
You didn't behave very well, Angel.

192
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,740
How can she work now?

193
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,220
Madam, please don't interrupt.

194
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,460
Did Angel rape you last night?
- No, he tried to.

195
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,940
He says he did.
- No. He came between my legs.

196
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,580
I see.

197
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,700
Do you mind telling me
what happened?

198
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,500
Madam, you may wait outside.
- Who, me?

199
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,260
Yes, this isn't very pleasant.

200
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,820
It isn't, but I wasn't born yesterday,
and Eva tells me everything.

201
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,220
Besides, this isn't the first time.

202
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,700
How many times have they tried?

203
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,780
Three or four?
- Three.

204
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,700
What happened?

205
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,620
I went out. I suppose
Angel followed me.

206
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,260
What time was it?
- Eight o'clock.

207
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,660
You're positive? This is very
important. Think about it.

208
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,700
Absolutely, I had a date.
- Very well, go on.

209
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,180
He dragged me to
a dead-end street...

210
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,740
and threatened me with a knife.

211
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,780
You know the rest.

212
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,700
While he was trying...
he ejaculated.

213
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,540
Anything else?

214
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,620
Yes. He said he was sorry
and then fainted.

215
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,660
What about that wound?
Did he hit you?

216
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,060
No, I slipped and fell afterwards.

217
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,780
Can we go now?
- One moment.

218
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,100
Do you want to report it?
- No. What good would it do?

219
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,860
But you've got to report it.

220
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,300
Be quiet, you've done
enough for one day!

221
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,180
Your poor mother,
she who is so pious!

222
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,380
I'm sorry, Señora, I really am.

223
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,300
Well, control yourself next time.

224
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,420
If we weren't here, I'd tell you
a couple of things! Goodbye.

225
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,020
How strange... he seems happy.

226
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,380
What is it?

227
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,980
You've never seen a dead man?

228
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,420
I've seen a lot of them.

229
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,340
Why are you shaking?

230
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,620
Did you know him?
- Yes.

231
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,100
You did?

232
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,900
How did you know him?

233
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,740
I killed him.

234
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,140
What?

235
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,220
At his place.

236
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,420
He was very excited.

237
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,620
He just wanted to possess me.

238
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,540
He undressed right away.

239
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,260
And when he was about to take me...

240
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,380
I killed him.

241
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,700
And this one?

242
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,140
Did you know him?

243
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,620
It was more or less the same.

244
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,380
Tell me about yourself.
What do you do?

245
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,660
I'm going to college
for my mother's sake.

246
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,780
But I want to be a bullfighter.

247
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,140
You like bulls?

248
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,260
I take classes with Diego Montes
but she thinks I take gym.

249
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,620
Diego Montes?

250
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,020
Angel...

251
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,940
I'm going to show you some
pictures. Study them closely.

252
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,060
Please take your time.

253
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,460
Do you know them?

254
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,660
They went to class with me.

255
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,980
I killed them too.

256
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,100
You?
- Do you know me?

257
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,540
No, I don't think so.

258
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,980
My name's Maria Cardenal
and I'm your attorney.

259
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,420
Why do you want to defend me?
- I think you're innocent.

260
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,900
Well, you're wrong.
I'm more guilty than you think.

261
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,500
Just ask my mother.

262
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,780
I'll speak to her.

263
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,540
So far we only know you
tried to rape Eva Soler.

264
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,900
Isn't that enough?
She's my maestro's girl.

265
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,300
By the way...

266
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,340
call him and tell him I'm sorry...

267
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,780
that it won't happen again.

268
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,060
Your maestro is Diego Montes,
isn't he?

269
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,620
Yes. Do you know him?

270
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,700
I saw him fight a bull once.

271
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:53,380
Was he very good?
- For me, he was the best.

272
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,740
Let's get back to business.

273
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,540
From now on, I'll make all the
decisions. Is that clear?

274
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,420
All right, I'll do as you say.

275
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,740
I'm glad to hear it.

276
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,940
Don't admit to any more murders.

277
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,860
Four are enough to start with.

278
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,620
You're right.

279
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,180
Don't open your eyes. Play dead.

280
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,740
Luckily, the police have arrested...

281
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,460
Eva soler's rapist, Angel Giménez...

282
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,900
Bastards! They said
they'd keep it quiet.

283
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,220
...who is also accused of murdering
Ester Dominguez, Ana Vela...

284
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,460
Raul Ordoñez and Pedro Soto.

285
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,940
His defending attorney
is Maria Cardenal.

286
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,740
Naturally, several prominent
feminists...

287
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,260
were outraged on learning
about this.

288
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:12,020
Miss Cardenal stated that any
Spanish citizen...

289
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,220
has the right to an attorney...

290
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,860
thus proving her cold-bloodedness
and cynicism.

291
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,580
Fuck!

292
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,700
Can you drive me home?

293
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,220
Who would have thought...
- I don't believe it.

294
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,020
If he were a murderer, he'd have
killed me and raped me too.

295
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,860
Poor baby, it must have been horrible.
- Let's forget it.

296
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,660
I'd like to but the cops won't let me

297
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,900
Have they called you?
- Not yet, but they will.

298
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,020
Can I take some sausages?
Mum loves them.

299
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,980
I feel sorry for Angel, poor thing!

300
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,140
Don't be silly, he had a knife.

301
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,940
Are you jealous?
- Angel is crazy.

302
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,860
So am I, but about you.

303
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
Come on, let's go.

304
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,180
May I see madam?

305
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,980
I don't know. I'll go and see.

306
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,780
Ma'am, the girl we saw on television
wants to see you.

307
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,540
I cannot see her.
- I don't think she'll give up.

308
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,020
Tell her I'm busy, I can't see anyone.

309
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,620
I must be alone with my grief.

310
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,820
Madam is out.

311
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,100
What do you mean?
I just heard her speaking.

312
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,020
Yes, but she can't see you.
She's in a meeting.

313
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,300
I'll stay until she sees me.

314
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,380
Very well. What do you want?

315
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,340
I'm Maria Cardenal.
- So what?

316
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,180
I'm your son's attorney.

317
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,100
My son must accept
God's punishment.

318
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,580
God won't be in the court, Señora.

319
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,700
Do you happen to be an atheist?

320
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,820
Shall we remain standing
or do we sit down?

321
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,140
Very well, come in, but we have
nothing to talk about.

322
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,420
I won't give a cent to an attorney.

323
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:24,580
I didn't come to discuss my fee,
but Angel, your son.

324
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,300
He's not my son!
Such a monster cannot be my son.

325
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,860
God cannot ask me to bear so much.
- Forget God for a moment.

326
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,020
I need information.

327
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,500
What can I tell you?
I did my best to save him.

328
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
He wasn't like other boys.

329
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:49,220
As a child, he had dreadful visions.
There was evil inside him.

330
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,980
I tried to make him fear himself
but to no avail.

331
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,900
Do you realize your son's situation?

332
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,140
Do you realize mine?

333
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,820
You don't happen to be in jail.

334
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,500
Grief and shame
are the worst of all jails.

335
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,020
How can a mother refuse
to defend her son?

336
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,940
You should know that there are
people one cannot defend.

337
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,060
That's true. I'd never defend
someone like you.

338
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,260
Father!

339
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:47,020
You always said you knew how to
shoot but I never believed it.

340
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,140
I love you, Luke.

341
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,060
Don't cry, Pearl. Don't cry.

342
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,620
I had to do it.

343
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,420
I understand.
Let me hold you in my arms.

344
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,180
Yes, hold me, Luke.

345
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,260
Why are you following me?

346
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,620
This is the men's room,
didn't you notice?

347
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,740
You shouldn't trust appearances.

348
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,460
Let's have a drink
in a sweeter-smelling place.

349
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,300
I'm not thirsty.

350
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,220
But I want to speak to you.

351
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,740
All this is yours?

352
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,380
I bought it from the Town Hall.

353
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,860
It's so peaceful and sinister.

354
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,060
Do you like it?

355
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,980
Very much.

356
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,300
It must have cost you a lot.

357
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,420
Money doesn't worry me.
I've made enough.

358
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,220
It can't have been easy.

359
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,820
I've never done anything
because it was easy.

360
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,660
You like bulls?

361
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,260
I prefer bullfighters.
- I'm glad to hear it.

362
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,860
What I like is a job well done.
- Me too.

363
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:14,260
Can I have it?
- No. I can give you some sausages.

364
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,780
I'd prefer something personal.

365
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,140
Will this do?
- Better than nothing.

366
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,580
You teach with video?
- I tape the kids.

367
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,500
Angel!

368
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,460
I saw him this morning.
- I saw you on television.

369
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,060
Why do you defend him?
He says he's guilty.

370
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,300
I don't think he acted consciously.

371
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,980
What about when he raped my girl?

372
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,260
He was imitating you.
You're his maestro.

373
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,380
Don't be silly. He's dangerous.

374
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,460
Maybe... but he's so lonely.

375
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,060
I'm lonely too.
- You too are dangerous.

376
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,700
You wanted to kill me?

377
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,060
I must defend myself
from aggressors.

378
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,260
Give me my pin back.

379
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,260
No. I think I deserve it.

380
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,500
When about to kill,
one cannot hesitate.

381
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,740
It's a golden rule of bullfighting.

382
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,540
If that's a wedding dress,
I'll eat my hat.

383
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,340
Hide that scar.
They might think I beat her up.

384
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,100
Absolutely not! Disfigure her?

385
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,820
Nobody's going to disfigure my baby.

386
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,620
What is this? A fashion show
or an anti-aesthetic march?

387
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,820
A butchery, Señora.
- A butchery?

388
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,500
Francisco Montesinos?
- Yes.

389
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,460
Such a vulgar man!
- I heard that.

390
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,340
I wanted to interview you.

391
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,940
Tomorrow.
- It won't take a minute.

392
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,140
All right, go ahead.

393
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:18,860
Why did you call this show
"Spain Divided"?

394
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,340
Spain's always divided in two.

395
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,620
In how many? Two, did you say?

396
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,980
Yes, basically in two.
- What are they?

397
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,700
The envious and the intolerant.

398
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,340
Which are you?
- Both.

399
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,620
I've told you not to shoot up
in the dressing room.

400
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,460
I'm nearly finished.

401
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,740
Use the toilet to shoot up,
that's what it's for.

402
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,260
And these models are...

403
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,820
She's puked all over me.

404
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,340
Don't worry. Go out like this,
you look divine.

405
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,980
When she shoots, you fall down...

406
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,540
and spread the cape
so that it can be seen.

407
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,860
Who kills the boy with the cape?

408
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,020
The one in red.
- Why?

409
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:22,100
Because he's beaten her up
and she's got a temper, like me.

410
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,980
That's why she's all bloodied up?

411
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,820
That's right.
- How interesting!

412
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,460
Don't you believe in marriage then?

413
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:37,060
Well, marriage is necessary
or there'd be no wedding dresses.

414
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,420
I'm off.
- Francis, the gun.

415
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:46,540
Hide it in the bouquet, then kill him.

416
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,460
Mum, why don't you go and keep
Diego company?

417
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,780
Yes, so much genius
drives me berserk.

418
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,700
How is it going?
- What a mess!

419
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,500
I'm glad I never accepted
modelling jobs.

420
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,100
Want some?
- No, thank you.

421
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,660
What are you looking at?

422
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,820
Ah, the girl with the plait.

423
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,580
I have one too but mine's
more discreet.

424
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,380
Lovely, Pilar.
- Thank you.

425
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,100
Know who it is?

426
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,500
Angel's attorney.

427
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,660
I didn't know attorneys liked frills.

428
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,820
She's a bit whorish.

429
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,580
Pretty... but then one goes
with the other.

430
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,700
Excuse me, Pilar.

431
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,460
There's a rotten smell to this.

432
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,820
I saw someone commit suicide here.

433
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,980
I felt something strange...

434
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,180
as if I were empty,
outside my body.

435
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,940
I often come back.

436
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,500
You and I are alike.
We both feel obsessed by death.

437
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,900
Who doesn't?

438
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,420
But not like you.

439
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,420
What if I hadn't grabbed your hand
yesterday?

440
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,700
What if I hadn't defended myself?

441
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,100
Aren't you coming?

442
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,420
That again?
Aren't you being morbid?

443
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,940
I have to speak to you.
- Some other time.

444
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,900
It's got to be now.
- What is it?

445
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,620
The agency wants me to go to Japan.

446
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,740
Mum loves the idea but I don't.

447
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,660
It would be good for your career.

448
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,620
I don't give a shit.
I don't want to leave you.

449
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,540
It would be better.

450
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,460
What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

451
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,860
Is it because of that woman?

452
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,180
It can't be.

453
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,580
You left the shower together,
don't deny it.

454
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,500
I'm not.

455
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,940
Don't play games with me!

456
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,540
Or you with me!
Go! Leave me alone!

457
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,660
Very well, I will.

458
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,820
He's in a bad mood lately...

459
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,460
but don't worry, he'll get over it.

460
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,580
I wouldn't leave him,
even if he asked me to.

461
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,300
Yes, who is it?
- I need to see you.

462
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,900
Why not?
- Because.

463
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,820
Don't call me again,
I won't see you.

464
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:50,460
Don't tell me you work here too?
- Yes, twice a week.

465
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,620
Is Maria here?
- Yes, I t think so.

466
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,860
Give it to her when I leave.

467
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,020
What is it?
- A surprise.

468
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,140
I'll give it to her.

469
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,940
Where's her office?
- Over there...

470
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,420
but here comes her secretary.

471
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,900
May I help you?
- Miss Cardenal's expecting me.

472
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,780
What is your name?
- Diego Montes.

473
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,420
She didn't mention anything.

474
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,700
She's very reserved at times.

475
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,100
Wait here, but I doubt that
she'll receive you.

476
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,220
There's this guy to see you.

477
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,740
Didn't I tell you to wait?

478
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,740
Go... and close the door.

479
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,300
I don't want to see you.

480
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,660
I have to speak to you.
- Is it that urgent?

481
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,700
Not here. I'm working.

482
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,620
What do you want from me?

483
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,580
Everything.

484
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:59,100
Give me back my pin.
- Is that all you're worried about?

485
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,060
What's this? Blackmail?
- What are you afraid of?

486
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,980
You know very well.

487
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,620
Please leave.

488
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,620
Maria, we're destined for each other.

489
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,940
No one, not even ourselves,
can avoid it.

490
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,780
Leave... or I'll shoot myself.

491
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,020
Diego brought this for you.

492
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,740
He gave it to me when he came in.

493
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,860
You didn't tell him...
- No. Now let me be.

494
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:24,100
They're amanita mascaria.
- They're very poisonous.

495
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:28,900
See the hood?
That's where the poison is.

496
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,020
Can I take one?

497
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:35,180
Sure, but be careful, don't eat it.
- Don't worry.

498
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,300
I'm Inspector Del Valle.
Is the maestro at home?

499
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,940
He's in the ring, with the kids.
Shall I call him?

500
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,380
No need. He lives here, doesn't he?

501
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,820
Yes, upstairs. He gives his
theory lessons downstairs.

502
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,420
We'll take a look.

503
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,860
How long have you been with him?
- Ever since he started.

504
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:02,380
After he was gored,
I came here to give him a hand.

505
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,500
I live here,
in the house by the garden.

506
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,300
With your family?

507
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,980
They live in Toledo.
I go there at weekends.

508
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,980
What about the sausages?

509
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,260
I make them myself.
Diego likes them.

510
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,220
Angel Giménez.

511
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,460
Two cops came.
They're watching you now.

512
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,860
Where?
- Behind the trees.

513
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,860
The inspector put his nose
into everything.

514
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,700
I'm inspector Del Valle.
I'm investigating your classmate.

515
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:07,340
I'm Diego Montes.
- I know who you are.

516
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,580
Will you be long?
- No, we finish at seven.

517
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,220
Do you remember
the 20th of last month?

518
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,380
It was the last time Angel
came to class.

519
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:23,980
I remember. That's the day the
maestro taught us how to kill.

520
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,020
Do you remember if he went
directly home after class?

521
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,340
Did he speak to any of you?

522
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,980
He told me he was going home
to study.

523
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,220
See this?

524
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,580
Look at it closely.

525
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,060
Does it belong to any of you?

526
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,860
Look at it closely.

527
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,820
It's very pretty.
Have you seen it before?

528
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:01,100
I don't suppose you saw Ana Veler
and Ester... Ester Dominguez again?

529
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,260
They're dead.
- How do you know?

530
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:07,220
The papers said so.
- Maybe. We've no proof yet.

531
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:11,540
You're aware of Angel's situation?

532
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,420
Why don't you tell me about him?

533
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,780
Anything would do.

534
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,860
Well, if you suddenly get
your memory back...

535
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,780
you can find me at
the Tetuan police station.

536
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,140
All right?

537
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:39,100
Very well, carry on,
you're doing very well.

538
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,260
Could I speak to you?

539
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,620
Go to the car.

540
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,620
A bull gored you?

541
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:06,100
Yes, what about you?
- It's psychological.

542
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:11,100
Do you think Angel
is a homosexual?

543
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,700
You knew him well.

544
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,780
No, I didn't. I gave him classes,
that's all.

545
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:21,900
Really? You took him upstairs
on the last day.

546
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,140
He wanted some water.
What are you insinuating?

547
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,900
So, besides the classes,
you also gave him water.

548
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,380
He needed to take a pill
and we chatted for a while.

549
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,380
About what?
- Chicks.

550
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:37,820
And that evening,
he tried to rape your girl.

551
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,940
What do you say?
- That he's a son of a bitch.

552
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,660
I don't know.

553
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,660
He's not easy to classify.

554
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,420
He's very unusual.
- He certainly is.

555
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:55,420
The other day he told me
he admired you a lot.

556
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,340
He did?

557
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,380
I don't see why.

558
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:09,420
Remember when the two girls
disappeared?

559
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,580
One three months ago
and the other, four.

560
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,340
Do you know if it happened
at a weekend?

561
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,940
There's no class at weekends.

562
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,260
I see.

563
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,580
Where did you find it?
- In the bullfighting school.

564
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,860
Is it mascaria?

565
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,300
Of course.

566
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,420
By the way, how are you
getting on with Angel?

567
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:49,580
He has a huge guilt complex, but then
his mother's a member of Opus Dei.

568
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,060
Do you think he killed them all?

569
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,860
Is that all you're worried about?

570
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,460
Don't you wonder why he did it?

571
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,980
Why is that mushroom poisonous?

572
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,420
Because it's in its nature.

573
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:06,460
Ours is the same.
Evil thrives inside us.

574
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,860
And goodness.
- Goodness is a bore.

575
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:13,860
People are not like mushrooms.
- No, they're more complicated.

576
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:18,380
You must feel for Angel,
even if he's guilty.

577
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:23,140
Yes, I feel very curious about him.
- Is that all?

578
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:26,580
There are always people
I'd like to be guilty...

579
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,180
and others to be innocent.

580
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:34,460
As far as Angel's concerned...
I'd like him to be innocent.

581
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:37,620
See? You're not as mean
as you seem.

582
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:41,300
Shall we sleep together toninght?
- I said no.

583
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,700
You don't have to screw me,
just sleep with me.

584
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,620
Please...

585
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,060
He's deaf in one ear.

586
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,940
That's why he has vertigo.

587
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,620
Will he need an operation?
- There's no need.

588
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:58,260
He hears perfectly with the other.

589
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:03,460
Don't bother him today.
He'll feel dizzy and needs rest.

590
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:08,580
Do you think his vertigo could
make him hypersensitive and...

591
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:13,020
People don't go around murdering
just because they're deaf.

592
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,260
Mental illness is often caused
by physical stress.

593
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,900
I know you're dizzy
but we must speak about the pin.

594
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,300
Was it really yours?

595
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,620
What did you want
such a pretty pin for?

596
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,420
To kill.

597
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,580
Where did you buy it?

598
01:04:55,100 --> 01:05:01,020
What does it matter?
- To help you, Angel, I must know.

599
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:05,100
Why can't you all leave me alone?

600
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,620
I'd like to be in the desert...

601
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:14,020
alone...

602
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:16,900
with no one around.

603
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,020
I can't sleep.

604
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,100
I hear the knives slipping
in and out...

605
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,860
pins being plunged into napes...

606
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,060
shots echoing in my head.

607
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:38,260
I can't stand it any more.

608
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:45,420
If you knew how many murders
take place!

609
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:51,260
I don't care about other murders,
only yours.

610
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,020
Angel is too tired to be questioned.

611
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,580
It won't wait.
He knows more than he says.

612
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:01,140
He's with his attorney.

613
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:04,060
Didn't you tell me he was tired?

614
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:08,340
Ana looked very pretty.

615
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:14,620
I had been fighting her all afternoon.
I was very excited.

616
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:21,820
After class she waited for me
on the platform...

617
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,860
stark naked...

618
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,940
and I strangled her...

619
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,140
while I took her.

620
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:47,380
And Ester Dominguez?

621
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,460
I killed her in the bath.

622
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:55,780
Where are the bodies?
- I buried them in the garden.

623
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,740
Alone?

624
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,620
Let's go and find them.

625
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,940
You were eavesdropping.

626
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,420
I'll deny everything.

627
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,780
I've got a witness.

628
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,140
I didn't hear anything.

629
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:25,300
Cunts! You think you're helping him
but it's ridiculous sentimentalism.

630
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,780
I'd rather be ridiculous
and have feelings.

631
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,900
You have plenty.

632
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:33,100
Of what?
- Feelings.

633
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:40,060
Let's show the inspector those bodies.
It will make him feel better.

634
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:45,620
He can't go out, he has vertigo
and needs an injection.

635
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:48,500
Give it to him!
What are you waiting for?

636
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,180
In you go, scum!

637
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,620
Where did you bury them?

638
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:32,620
Come on, hurry up!

639
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,820
Look, a russula.

640
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,020
A russula.
- Yes a basidiomycete.

641
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:37,020
Help him to dig.

642
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:40,420
Leave the shovels, use pickaxes.

643
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,620
Get back, young man.

644
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,500
Get the bags.

645
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:07,100
What now?  - I don't know.
This is becoming a challenge for me.

646
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,060
Maestro...

647
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:13,620
I want to tell you I'm sorry about Eva.

648
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:16,540
Compared to this, it's nothing.

649
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,140
You're not angry?

650
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,580
Trust me.

651
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:28,780
Am I in danger?
- Yes, but you can trust me.

652
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,900
Take Angel to the car.

653
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:37,340
Why must you trust him?
- He still sees me as his maestro.

654
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:41,300
Aren't you?
- I certainly didn't teach him to dig.

655
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,820
He buries two bodies here
and you don't know?

656
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,380
I go out sometimes.

657
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,900
Your argument is thin.
- So is yours.

658
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,860
Get some better proof.
- I will.

659
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,980
Then I'll get better excuses.

660
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,340
We'll see.

661
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,940
I suspected it but I wasn't sure.

662
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,180
I want to show you something.

663
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:46,340
No one's been to my hiding place.

664
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:48,660
It's wonderful.

665
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,580
I have a surprise for you.
Close your eyes.

666
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:56,420
Careful, there's a step.

667
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:04,300
I can't see a thing.

668
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,220
Wait...

669
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,300
Open your eyes now.

670
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,780
My costume!

671
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,300
How did you get it?

672
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,420
Your assistant sold it to me.

673
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,180
And these?

674
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:42,660
The cleaning lady stole them
and sold them to me.

675
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:47,860
I must have been blind
not to see you.

676
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,380
When did you start this collection?

677
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,420
When I first saw you kill.

678
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,860
I looked for you
in all the men I've loved.

679
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:07,420
I tried to imitate you
when I killed them.

680
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,100
Why didn't you look for me?

681
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:15,860
Till today I'd no idea
you were still a matador.

682
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:23,100
At first I tried to avoid it
but I couldn't.

683
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:29,100
To stop killing was to stop living.

684
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:32,620
Men think killing is a crime.

685
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,700
Women don't see it like that.

686
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:40,780
Every murderer has
a feminine side.

687
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,060
And every murderess
a masculine side.

688
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:49,540
I've waited so long for this moment.
I wonder if I'm dreaming.

689
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:53,620
Ever since I met you
I've been unable to sleep.

690
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:55,660
I can't sleep either.

691
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,580
And if you don't sleep you don't live.

692
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:03,460
I don't think I'll sleep
while you're alive...

693
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,380
that I'll live while you're alive.

694
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,260
Your son cannot be guilty...

695
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:19,380
of one of the crimes he admits to.

696
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:25,300
He was in his bullfighting class and
arrived home fifteen minutes later.

697
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:30,020
Yes, but what about the others?
You have evidence.

698
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:34,860
The more they point to him,
the less I believe he's guilty.

699
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:37,780
A strange way to investigate.

700
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:44,740
I want you to speak to him.
He won't lie to you.

701
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:49,220
He's lied to me for the past
twenty-two years.

702
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,980
Like his father did,
may he rest in peace.

703
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,900
Speak to his psychiatrist then.

704
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:00,100
I'll go with you.
I want to hear the conversation.

705
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:22,060
Christ! He's fainted again.
Slap him hard, see if he comes to.

706
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,300
What happened?
- He fainted.

707
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,420
Quick, get some coramine.

708
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:39,100
He's very weak, he hardly eats.
- No, it's the wounded man.

709
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,060
He can't stand the sight of blood.

710
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:47,620
What? He can't stand blood?
- No, he isn't like me.

711
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:51,500
He's a coward, just like his father.

712
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:54,300
He could never wear a cilice.

713
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,220
One drop of blood
was enough to make him faint.

714
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,580
Do you realize what you're saying?

715
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:03,900
Of course. I'm his mother.

716
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:08,300
Do you think your son's a murderer?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

717
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:12,220
How, if he can't stand
the sight of blood?

718
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,980
I don't know.

719
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:21,500
The devil's ways are unfathomable.

720
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,820
Poor Angel!

721
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:42,100
Here's the coramine.
- He doesn't need it.

722
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:43,620
The moon will hide
the sun...

723
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:47,340
"The police believe Angel Giménez
is innocent."

724
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:52,180
...stars will shine,
birds will fly to their nests...

725
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:57,420
and wild animals will run to their
burrows, believing night has fallen...

726
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:00,980
not suspecting that the sun
will soon shine...

727
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:06,620
thus confusing these poor beasts
enslaved by their instinct.

728
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,860
Such a strange world!

729
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:15,020
Hundreds of scientists,
members of religious sects...

730
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,940
Shall we go to the movies?

731
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,620
Aren't you getting up?
- No.

732
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,140
Because of the eclipse?
- What eclipse?

733
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:27,140
They just spoke about it
on television.

734
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:30,060
You're a bit out of touch, Eva.

735
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,620
If it's Diego's fault, just forget him.

736
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:37,620
If you wanted, you could find
a better match.

737
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:42,540
A lawyer, a dentist, or a minister
would be easier to deal with.

738
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,220
Get one yourself.

739
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,580
Don't make the mistake I made.

740
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:52,420
At your age,
I was pretty and thin too.

741
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,700
But Mum, I love him.

742
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:58,620
I loved your father
and what good did it do?

743
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:06,580
Diego, I was thinking of you.

744
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:11,380
Please come and collect your things.
I gave them to Mariano.

745
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,980
I want to speak to you.
- It's useless.

746
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:19,180
I'm having a very bad time, Diego.
- It would be worse...

747
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,420
It's best like this.

748
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:23,620
But...
- Sorry.

749
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:31,980
You should assert yourself more.

750
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,380
Leave me alone!

751
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:43,860
Eva, darling, you've been
in there an hour.

752
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,980
Open the door, I'm getting worried.

753
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:50,620
I've made you some nice gazpacho.

754
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:59,620
You're so pale! Do you feel sick?
- No, it's the make-up.

755
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:04,740
Well, you look like a corpse.
- Good. Help me slip this on.

756
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:10,340
Where are you going?
- For a walk.

757
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:14,100
Like this? No wonder
they try to rape you.

758
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:20,020
You're going to see him?
- None of your business.

759
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:23,900
What can a poor mother do?

760
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:31,020
Diego's not at home
but he left a bag for you.

761
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:33,100
I came to pick it up.

762
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:38,740
I was just leaving... the eclipse...
I want to be there early.

763
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,620
No, you wait here.

764
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:53,300
Let me come in.
It's cold and I have to speak to him.

765
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:57,820
If you didn't go out half-naked...
- Let me in.

766
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:01,260
He's going to get angry.

767
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:05,100
He said not to let you in.
- Mariano, please.

768
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:12,140
Oh, all right, come in.
You two can make up

769
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,940
"Dear Diego, I love you."

770
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:47,900
Where's the poster?
- Behind the blackboard.

771
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:52,060
Don't worry about Mariano,
he didn't see you bury them.

772
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:55,420
But both girls disappeared
at a weekend.

773
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:59,780
Then the inspector knows
I'm alone here.

774
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:04,180
He suspects, that's all.
If he knew, he'd have arrested you.

775
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,980
But Angel knows...
- No, he guesses.

776
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,100
But I'm sure he won't talk.

777
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,300
I know the police.

778
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:15,580
They're postponing everything,
hoping you'll make a mistake.

779
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:19,620
Why wait any longer?
You, too, postpone everything.

780
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:24,940
Since I met you I've been waiting
for the greatest orgasm ever.

781
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:27,540
And I enjoy waiting for it.

782
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:33,820
You're not safe either. They know
Angel didn't kill those men.

783
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:37,940
So what? Nobody saw me with them.

784
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:42,740
I've only been seen with you.
You're my only danger.

785
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,820
Danger doesn't scare me.

786
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:49,900
But the police mustn't catch us.
That's not the game we want.

787
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:54,700
I'll give you the cape.
Angel will like having it.

788
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:58,220
I'm so excited
that I'm losing my mind.

789
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,740
Give me a week
to sort out the office.

790
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,860
A week, no more.

791
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,460
Do you want it as badly as I do?

792
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:11,780
More than you.
I've waited much longer.

793
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:16,180
You need a bag.

794
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,100
What is it?
- I'm sick of it.

795
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:34,660
What shall I tell Angel?
- Tell him...

796
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,180
Tell him thank you.

797
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:40,300
Only a desperate man
would say that.

798
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,220
I'm that man.

799
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,900
Call me, I'm in a hurry.

800
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:51,420
We'll get everything ready tonight.

801
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,180
Eva, come on out.

802
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:17,620
I told you not to come.
Why did you? Fool!

803
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,340
I heard it all.

804
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:28,380
I should never have trusted you.
- From now on, you'll have to.

805
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:32,700
Your future is in my hands.
- And yours in mine.

806
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,980
Aren't you afraid of me?

807
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:43,780
I'm only afraid of you leaving me.

808
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:46,980
I wanted to keep you out of all this.

809
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:53,380
It's best if you go and forget me.

810
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:59,420
I can't forget you.
I've tried but I can't. I love you.

811
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:03,180
You'll get over it. You'll see.

812
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,580
I don't want to.

813
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:10,700
It's that woman's fault.
You've gone mad!

814
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:15,460
Yes, I am mad, but it's too late now.
- No, trust me.

815
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:18,580
Forget me and everything you heard.

816
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:22,140
I'll forget if you stay with me.
We'll forget together.

817
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,820
I don't want to hurt you.

818
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:27,420
Don't make things more difficult.

819
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:31,140
Our love can be saved.
- Do you really think so?

820
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:33,700
I can rebuild it.

821
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:38,900
Trust me. Give me a chance.

822
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,460
All right... Rebuild it.

823
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:46,020
Let me stay with you.

824
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:49,820
Not today, I'm too upset. Tomorrow.

825
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,700
If I leave, you'll go to see her.

826
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:56,260
Promise me you won't.
- I promise.

827
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:59,900
But promise me you'll forget.

828
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:07,340
If you keep your promise,
I'll keep mine.

829
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:20,140
We made a deal.

830
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:26,660
Eva knows everything.
She heard us talking.

831
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:30,020
Damn brat! Hadn't you broken
with her?

832
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:35,300
How did she take it?
- I swore I'd go back to her.

833
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:37,940
I knew that girl would
be trouble.

834
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:41,060
We can't wait.
Where do I pick you up?

835
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:45,020
Well, I've got to buy something.

836
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:50,020
Shall we say in the jewellery shop
in twenty minutes?

837
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:54,300
What a bore you are.
- I won't be long.

838
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:14,220
I'm off, Pepita.
- But this gentleman...

839
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:18,220
Come back on Monday, won't you?
Here, take this to Angel.

840
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,860
What's wrong?
- Nothing... the eclipse.

841
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:31,100
I want to speak to you.
- Come back on Monday.

842
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:34,860
You wouldn't go to him,
you fucking whore!

843
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:07,220
I heard it all.
- So what!

844
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:08,980
You're in my hands.
- Really?

845
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:11,100
You know it.

846
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:17,220
What do you want?
- Leave Diego alone. He needs me.

847
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:21,380
Don't you think it's dangerous
to be with him?

848
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:25,020
I don't care about danger.
- What do you know?

849
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:29,180
He was a normal man.
- He's killed two girls.

850
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:33,900
That's because he was gored.
With my help, he'll be fine.

851
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:38,100
All you offer him is worthless.

852
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,780
Diego belongs to another species.

853
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:42,700
Mine!

854
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:47,580
I'll speak to the police.
You need me.

855
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:51,700
Nobody will believe your story.

856
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,700
When two heavenly bodies meet...

857
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,740
their lights apparently extinguish
themselves.

858
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:15,540
But for a brief moment...

859
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:19,420
they acquire a new brightness...

860
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,420
a bright and burning brightness.

861
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,860
What a lovely way
to describe an eclipse!

862
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:32,300
Something dreadful's going to happen.
- The eclipse affects your ear.

863
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,220
We must do something.

864
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:36,940
I have a theory,
it's not very scientific...

865
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:40,380
but every time you suffer
from vertigo...

866
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:43,300
you're in a half-hypnotic state.

867
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:48,860
I'd like to know what's going on
in your head.

868
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:53,700
We must do something to avoid it.
- I suppose we'll have to operate.

869
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:57,420
It's Diego.
- Can you see him?

870
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:00,660
Maria and him, in the car.
They're in danger.

871
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:03,540
What are they doing?
- They've stopped.

872
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:07,500
He's buying some flowers.
- That's not dangerous.

873
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:10,620
I'll buy a car like that one
when you grow up.

874
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:15,100
Flowers, handsome?
- Yes, roses.

875
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:18,460
Help yourself, I'm holding the baby.

876
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:22,700
Take another one,
I'm sure you can afford it.

877
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:29,620
Thanks, generous.
Here, let me read your palm.

878
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:43,820
What a pity!

879
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:48,260
You wouldn't accuse him
out of spite?

880
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:51,660
It's the truth.
Why don't you check?

881
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:53,820
Don't worry, I will.

882
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:01,860
Angel says Diego Montes
is in danger.

883
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:05,780
You too?
What's wrong with women today?

884
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:09,940
How do you know?
- Angel says so.

885
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:13,140
How does he know?
- He sees things we don't.

886
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:15,100
It's the occasion to prove it.

887
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:19,140
You're driving me mad!
Eva's here too.

888
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:22,740
She says Diego and Maria
are the murderers.

889
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:27,300
Then something is happening.
We're on our way.

890
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:30,460
What's going on?

891
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:35,300
I'd like to know...
- Well, find out.

892
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:50,700
Here he is.
- We must hurry up.

893
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:53,020
Just a moment.

894
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:57,020
If they met half an hour ago,
they're far away by now.

895
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,620
They're still here.

896
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,180
Angel, can you really see them?

897
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:07,500
Where are they?

898
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,980
There's a tunnel...

899
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:12,860
and a fountain with birds.

900
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,500
That's the road to Valencia.

901
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:19,060
Get an arrest warrant for Montes.

902
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,060
What about Maria?
- Go to her office.

903
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:26,980
If you're doing this for revenge,
get ready!

904
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:37,780
Where to?
- To Valencia.

905
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:44,140
Can you see the car?
- Yes. They're passing a factory.

906
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:49,060
The "Alcoholera de Chinchón"

907
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:53,140
Why do you believe him?

908
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,980
It's as if the eclipse
had hypnotised you.

909
01:33:56,260 --> 01:34:00,220
Some things cannot be explained.
That's one of them.

910
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,660
Home at last!

911
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:21,180
Can you give me a hand?

912
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:26,620
To have planned it for so long
and be taken by surprise!

913
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:34,460
For years I've felt that scar
inside me...

914
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:37,380
yet I never kissed it.

915
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:57,980
Wait for me in heaven, my love.

916
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:03,580
If you were to leave before me.

917
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:08,180
Wait for me.

918
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:10,460
For soon I will go.

919
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:15,980
Wherever you are.

920
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:22,300
Wait for me in heaven, my love.

921
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:27,260
If you were to leave first.

922
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:33,980
Wait for me, for soon I will go.

923
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:38,980
So we may stay anew.

924
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:46,980
Our love is so great.

925
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:52,540
So great that it has no end.

926
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,780
And life is so short.

927
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:00,500
Too short.

928
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:04,980
For our romance.

929
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:10,780
That's why I ask you, please.

930
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:14,980
To wait for me in heaven.

931
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:22,460
And there, among soft clouds.

932
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:27,700
We shall make our nest.

933
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:34,460
Nobody has ever kissed me like this.

934
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:37,980
Till now, I always made love alone.

935
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:41,740
I love you more than my own death.

936
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:45,300
Would you like to see me dead?

937
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:50,260
Yes... and for you to see me dead.

938
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,980
Can you hear them?

939
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:59,780
She tells him...

940
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:03,460
"Nobody has ever kissed me
like this."

941
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:08,300
"Till now, I always made love
alone"

942
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:12,820
"I love you more than
my own death."

943
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,940
"Would you like to see me dead?"

944
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:18,980
What does he answer?

945
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:23,660
"Yes... and for you to see me dead."

946
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:22,420
Look at me...

947
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,820
Look at me dying.

948
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,500
Look at me.

949
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,700
The eclipse.

950
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:09,300
I couldn't save him.

951
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:11,340
Nobody could.

952
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:14,060
It's better like this.

953
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:18,020
I've never seen anyone so happy.
