2
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,299
There is so little deep down.

3
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,100
Millions of millions of tons
of water, rocks and gas.

4
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,000
Affection.

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,500
Blood.

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,000
A hundred minutes, a thousand years.

7
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,200
Ashes. Light. Now.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,200
This now.

9
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,000
A while ago ...

10
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,500
Fire!

11
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:33,099
No!

12
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,700
I told you before, didn't l?

13
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,900
There are very few things ...

14
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,099
Silence and words.

15
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,900
The Secret Life of Words

16
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:16,000
Hanna Amiran, p lease come to the main office.

17
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,000
Hanna Amiran, right?

18
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,600
Yes.
- And you've been with us for four years?

19
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,899
Yes, that's right.

20
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,199
We're happy with you.

21
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,000
You don't have to worry,
as far as the company is concerned.

22
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,500
Very satisfied, l can assure you.
- Good.

23
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,800
The problem here is the others.

24
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,300
Your colleagues, your workmates,
the people you work with.

25
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,100
There's been ...

26
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,500
complaints, reports ...

27
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,600
The trade union committee, you know.

28
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,500
No, l don't.

29
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
Am l being fired?

30
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,399
Should l go now?
- Hanna,

31
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,399
l have just told you,
we are happy with you.

32
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,699
How could l sack you?

33
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:27,100
ln your four years with us, you've never
taken a holiday, never been sick or late.

34
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,800
How can l possible give you the sack?

35
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,399
Take a month holiday, for Christ's sake.

36
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,899
A whole month?

37
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:44,800
Yeah, l've got some brochures, here.

38
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,399
Just in case l decide to go myself,
one of these days.

39
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,800
You know, there's some beautiful,
heavenly places to go in the world.

40
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,699
Places that ...

41
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,899
Places with palm trees,
and lounges on the beach.

42
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,600
And waiters serving pina colada,
and that drink with the smoke in it.

43
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
And aerobics in the pool.

44
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,899
Here, look.

45
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,600
Take the ones you want.
l'll get more.

46
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,800
l've got plenty more.

47
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,399
What's the matter, don't you like palm trees?

48
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,199
Palm trees are okay, but ...
- But what?

49
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,699
Do they ...

50
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,199
Do they make you do aerobics in the pool?

51
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,899
What happens if you don't want to?

52
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,699
She has never seen my face,

53
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:53,000
but l'm her only company.

54
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,000
She sees me dressed
in red corduroy dungarees.

55
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,800
A light blue polo jersey.

56
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,800
The dungarees are always red.
The jersey's always blue.

57
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,699
Why?
She doesn't know why.

58
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,500
The hair is never the same.

59
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,300
Sometimes shoulder length,
and sometimes this way ...

60
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,399
Let me tell you,
a horrible pudding bowl cut.

61
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
l like cold milk.

62
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,800
When it's hot, makes me feel sick.

63
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,399
lnge speaking.

64
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:36,899
Hello?

65
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
Hello?

66
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,700
ls that you, Hanna?

67
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:51,000
We l l, if there,s no heavy breathing
or groaning,  l, l l know it,s you.

68
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,600
Did you answer my last letter?

69
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,500
Do you ever read them?
l wouldn't ask you to answer them.

70
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh, Hanna. Hanna ...

71
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,399
She told me stories tonight.
They were a bit scary.

72
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,200
And then, she lied down by my side
until l closed my eyes.

73
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,299
She's stroking my hair.

74
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
lt's too long.
l'll have to get it cut soon.

75
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,299
Sure, Claude Van Damme,s got more muscle,
but Vin Diesel,s a better actor.

76
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,000
There's not much difference
as far as muscle's concerned.

77
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,000
But there's no doubt about it,
Vin Diesel acts better.

78
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,299
Want a biscuit?

79
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,600
l didn't bring any chocolate ones,
because l know you're not a chocolate person.

80
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,500
Oh ...
- lt's nice to get out of there ...

81
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,299
Stretch your legs ...

82
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,399
Okay.

83
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,000
Look, we're not talking about over night,
are we?

84
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,899
Let me do things right, for once?
Or is this an emergency?

85
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Tell me we're talking about a real emergency.

86
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Yeah. Could l have a little more
sweet and sour sauce, and some hot sauce?

87
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,100
Sorry, just trying to eat, as if you didn't
know. lt's my lunch hour.

88
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,000
l know you're sorry about it.

89
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,000
Where do l find a nurse
to look after him till we get him off?

90
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Or a male nurse
who wants to spend a few days ...

91
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,299
l'll call you. l'll call.
Okay, bye.

92
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:47,700
l'm a nurse.

93
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:53,600
Sorry about the mess.
There's 3 of them, you know what it's like.

94
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,299
There's nothing else on the seat, is there?

95
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,899
You're luck the youngest wasn't sick today.
Smell takes ages to go away.

96
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,700
lt's awful. l mean, even if
it's your own kids, it's awful.

97
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:12,299
This'll only take a few weeks at the most,
until he's well enough for us to get him off.

98
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
After the death taking place
the company can't run any more risks.

99
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,799
l'm not speaking too fast, am l?
- No, l understand you.

100
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,899
The problem is the noise.

101
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,799
Boom, boom, the noise of the pumping.
There are places where you hardly notice it.

102
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
lt's no where to go on holiday, although ...
When the oil runs out, and it will soon,

103
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,200
our grandkids will
be using propane or chow shit, you'll see.

104
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,600
And when it runs out you'll see them turn
these places into hotels and theme parks.

105
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,000
l'm gonna stop off at the chemist
and get what Dr. Sulitzer wants.

106
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,299
Here's the list. Do you want to see it?
- lf the doctor said this, it'll be fine.

107
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,700
Of course.

108
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,600
There's levels, isn't there?

109
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,700
lf it comes from higher up ...

110
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,000
lt's a power pyramid, isn't it, eh?

111
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,000
Where is it going?
Does it really matter?

112
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,600
Do you think she really minds
floating above 50,000 tons of steel,

113
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,500
which are hit by 28,000 waves every day?

114
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,899
Sometimes more?

115
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,399
ls that all?

116
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,200
Killing time before time kills you.

117
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:16,399
ls that all?

118
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,200
Waves and more waves.
Never two the same.

119
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,500
This is Hanna, the nurse who's
looking after the casualty. What's his name?

120
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,399
Josef. The doctor's with him.
You'll find the way? Down there.

121
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,899
We've got to load the ...
- Should l take your stuff?

122
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,200
Okay?
- Come this way.

123
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,400
You alright, there?
Martin! Martin!

124
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,200
Martin, Martin!
Give us a hand, mate.

125
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,700
l don't know if it's further up.
l'm usually in the refinery, you know.

126
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,000
Only been here 4 or 5 times.

127
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:56,099
Make sure they give you the grand tour,
otherwise you'll keep getting lost.

128
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,700
l'll ask Dimitri,
he's the man in charge here.

129
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,900
You don't smoke, do you?
l forgot to tell you there's no smoking here.

130
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:08,200
Or you can imagine why.
- No.

131
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,299
Good. l'm trying to give up, myself.

132
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,799
Hello. You must be the nurse
that Victor managed to find.

133
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,900
Hanna Amiran.

134
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,599
Have you ever taken care of burns before?

135
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,099
That's what Victor said.
- Yes, l was in the burn recovery unit.

136
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,599
Oh, good. Good. Well, actually,
he has fractures too, to an arm and a leg.

137
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,799
There are burns to his body and face and ...

138
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
There's some damage to his corneas.

139
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,000
He won't be able to see anything
for the next two weeks.

140
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Maybe less, but by then,
he'll be out of here.

141
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,500
You better come this way.

142
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:21,099
lt was Josef's room, in fact.
lt's the nearest one to the sickbay.

143
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,500
Sorry,
l haven't had a chance to clear up yet.

144
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,200
The man who hired me
said there's a constant sound.

145
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,299
A noise.

146
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,299
Well, we're almost shut down.

147
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:40,099
Since the accident the rig's ...
Well, it's shutting down since the accident.

148
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:43,500
We're just waiting to find out
what'll happen to ...

149
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,000
To all of us.
You know, the company.

150
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,299
Shall we?

151
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:15,400
l've just given him a painkiller.

152
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,200
The facial injuries
have been giving him some trouble.

153
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,799
Like l said, he'll be blind for a while.

154
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,500
Shall l put some of this in the fridge?
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

155
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,700
Actually, put it all in there.

156
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,200
lt,s because of the damp.
lt,s unbelievably damp here.

157
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,599
So, you worked at a hospital in this country?
- No.

158
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:47,200
ls it that important? Fracture is fracture,
burn is burn. Here and everywhere.

159
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,799
l take care of the temperature chart,
give painkillers, help him urinate, clean him.

160
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,799
l,ve done it before with people
who were much worse than he is.

161
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,299
lf he gets really bad,
then l call you, l suppose.

162
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:07,900
Yes, of course. Forgive me.

163
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,099
Yes, you can call me from Dimitri's office.

164
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:25,000
l ... You know, my wife's a foreigner, too.
She's Columbian.

165
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,700
l mean ... l'm not prejudiced.

166
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,200
l wouldn't like you to think l'm prejudiced.
l'm not that kind of person.

167
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,299
Maybe you are not ...

168
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,000
But l am.

169

170
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,599
Josef, Hi. Here  l am.

171
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,900
l,m reading ''Letters of a Portuguese Nun,,,
again,  l know, it,s si l ly.

172
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,400
But, reading that book,
l fee l  like  l,m ta lking to you.

173
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,400
Like  l,m c lose to you, and if  l,m c lose to
you  l don,t fee l gui lty anymore.

174
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,799
l dream of you every night. Maybe because  l
go to bed  listening to the message you  left,

175
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,000
saying how much you  liked missing me.

176
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,700
Josef,  l  love you.
Like that Portuguese nun, even more.

177
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,299
Much more. Come on, ca l l me.

178
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,099
Ca l l me,  l know, it's not easy ...
But, but ...

179
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,700
Ca l l me, my  love, p lease?
Okay.  l  love you so much.

180
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,700
o much. Bye-bye. Bye.

181
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,900
Sulitzer?

182
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,299
Sulitzer, l need a drink
and l got to piss like a racehorse.

183
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,900
The doctor has gone.

184
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,000
l'm the nurse.

185
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,500
Nurse?
Am l ...

186
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,099
Where am l?
Did they take me somewhere?

187
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,900
No, we're still here. On the oil rig.

188
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,799
They brought you here to look after me?

189
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,799
Fuck, man. They must be really worried.

190
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:14,000
l'll get the bedpan.

191
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,900
Your name wouldn't be Cora,
by any chance, would it?

192
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,500
No.

193
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What's your name?

194
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:56,700
Now you,re holding my dick
and l,m pissing in front of you.

195
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,299
We could call each other by our first names.
Maybe even ...

196
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,599
Start a new life together.
Get married, have kids.

197
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,900
Where are you from?

198
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,900
Are you married?

199
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,900
Got a boyfriend?

200
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,700
Girlfriend?

201
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,000
Are you a day person
or a night person?

202
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,500
Do you prefer circumcised men, or do you
think it really doesn't matter anyway?

203
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:39,599
The last drop, as my mother used to say.

204
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,700
You don't have to answer
about being married, that was rude.

205
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,799
But the one about circumcised men?

206
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
l'm not leaving here
until you give me an answer.

207
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,400
Lift up your arm.

208
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:13,200
l like your accent.
ls it Swedish, or Russian?

209
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,400
That hurt. Oh, fuck.
- l'll get you a painkiller in a few hours.

210
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,400
Are you hungry?

211
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:34,299
Are you blond?
l bet you're a blond.

212
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,000
You got a blonde's voice.

213
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:42,599
Like butter, and cinnamon.

214
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:49,900
Like those Danish cookies
they sell in the round, blue, metal tins.

215
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,000
Here's some water.

216
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
lt's enough?

217
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:25,099
Are you sure your name's not Cora?
- l'll change your bandages tomorrow.

218
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,000
My body is itchy all over.

219
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,799
Guess that means l'm still alive.

220
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,799
Yippee.

221
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,400
Lift up your arm, again.

222
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,400
l'll go and fetch your supper,
and later l'll give you another painkiller.

223
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,500
Aren't you even gonna tell me your name?

224
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Cora.

225
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,900
You can call me Cora.

226
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,900
And l'm a redhead.

227
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,900
Hi.

228
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,000
l've come to ...
- You like ltalian food?

229
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,900
l hope so, because that's what's on tonight.

230
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Sorry, l'm Simon, the cook,
you must be Hanna,

231
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,299
Victor told me, how's Josef?
- He's...

232
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,000
Okay, Simon, Hanna, Victor, Josef.
l said four names in one sentence.

233
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,700
Considering his condition, he's alright.
l've come for his supper.

234
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:27,000
Yeah, gnocchi ''diavola,, and beef.

235
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,799
With basil leaves and pink pepper.

236
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,900
Where you from?
l could cook you something from your country.

237
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,900
lf you want.

238
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,799
Don't bother yourself.
- lt's no bother.

239
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,900
lt's what l do to stop going up the wall.

240
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,500
You know,
l cook something different, everyday.

241
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,599
l put on music
from the same place the recipe's from.

242
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:03,700
l've got to do something.
This place is a completely ...

243
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,200
How could l explain?
A real bore. Let's see ...

244
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,500
Shall l put the ice cream
on the tray, as well?

245
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,500
lt,s not real mascarpone, it,s Philly spread
with a dollop of fresh cream.

246
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,500
l think it'll be just right.

247
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,900
Will you come back after supper?
There's plenty of food.

248
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:29,599
lf you want l can fix up the gnocchi ...
- lt depends on how Josef feels.

249
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:35,599
Yeah, of course, of course.
Or l could bring your tray to your room.

250
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:51,000
Open.

251
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,799
lt's good.

252
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,700
What kind of pasta is it?
- l don't know. Open.

253
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,900
He said it was something like nokkies.

254
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,400
Simon's a good cook. l don't know why
he's wasting his time here for.

255
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,099
What's for dessert?

256
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,700
Don't you want some more?
There's beef, later.

257
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:26,200
ls it ice cream?
l love ice cream.

258
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,599
Yes. Cheese ice, he said, l think.
- Mascarpone, my favorite.

259
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,599
What kind of food do you like, Cora?

260
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,599
Open.

261
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:42,799
l like chicken.

262
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,799
Hallelujah, that,s the first piece of
information you,ve given me.

263
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,799
Aside from being a redhead,
which l don,t believe.

264
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,700
Go on. l'm excited now.
Chicken, what else?

265
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,900
Rice.

266
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,200
White rice, and apples.

267
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah, go on.

268
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,799
Nothing else.

269
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,000
Nothing else?

270
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,400
That's all you eat? Come on, now.

271
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:28,000
Don't you like chocolate?

272
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,799
Don,t you have a weakness
for coconut Bounty bars?

273
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:36,400
Sunflower seeds?

274
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,900
Honey roasted peanuts?

275
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,799
Häagen Dazs ginger and lychee ice cream?

276
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,599
Come on, Cora. What about spinach lasagna?

277
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,099
Come on. Lamb curry with currants and dates?
Jesus, what,s wrong with you, Cora?

278
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,000
What kind of rock you been hiding under?
- Want more ...

279
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,000
No. Just give me the fucking painkiller.

280
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,400
Chicken, white rice and apples.

281
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,300
You didn't come for dinner, last night.

282
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:04,800
l wasn't hungry.

283
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,699
Simon wanted to bring you a tray,
but l told him you ...

284
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,300
looked like someone
who wants to be left alone.

285
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,500
Thanks.

286
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:22,099
lt's alright.

287
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,300
l like to be left alone, too.

288
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Suppose that's why l'm here.

289
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,800
Like the rest.

290
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:39,400
The goose is called Lisa.

291
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,699
The man who died in the fire
brought her on board.

292
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Where can l wash my clothes?

293
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,800
Here is the washing powder.

294
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,900
Yeah, and here is the softener.

295
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:05,400
Ask Simon for anything else.

296
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:09,300
How many people work here?
- Now?

297
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,800
Simon and Abdul,
he's in charge of the cleaning. And ...

298
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,099
Scott, Liam, in the engine room.

299
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,800
Josef, you ... and me.

300
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,800
The guy that plays basketball?
- Martin?

301
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,699
He's an oceanographer,
he's been here a couple of months, now.

302
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,300
Measuring the number of waves that his us,
every day.

303
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:39,800
The strength of the sea.

304
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,900
And is the number of waves important?
- l don't know.

305
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:51,199
l'm not quite sure who he works for,
but it matters to him, certainly.

306
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,400
But ...

307
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,699
He doesn't speak too much to us.

308
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,699
Another one who wants to be left alone.

309
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,599
There are quite a few of us.

310
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,699
God makes them.

311
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,599
Cora?
Are you a nun?

312
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,599
You're a nun, aren't you?

313
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,000
That explains everything.

314
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:55,900
You are Cora,
Little Sister of the Chicken and the Rice.

315
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:03,300
Cora, Little Sister of the Helpless.

316
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:09,099
Blessed are the chapped ...
are the bed...

317
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,800
What kind of redhead are you?

318
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
L'Oreal?

319
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Henna?

320
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,500
For real, with red hair down below it all?

321
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,800
No, you,re not a nun. A nun would talk to me.

322
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,199
With their kind natures, and airs of being
above everything they know nothing about.

323
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,199
l'm in your sexy latex hands, Cora.

324
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,099
And ...

325
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,599
Your smell.

326
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,699
You don,t like Eau de Colognes,
you don,t use 'em.

327
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,500
l don't like perfumes either.
Fuckin' perfume. Fuck perfume.

328
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,900
You ... You have a clean smell.

329
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:30,800
Like a ...
Like a sweet almond soap.

330
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,099
Maybe that's why l mistook you for a nun.

331
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,599
Why do you call me Cora?
- Oh ...

332
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,800
Oh, you don't give out a bit of information,
and ...

333
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,300
Not one bit, just absurd lies.
Chicken, rice, apples.

334
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,099
Now you want me to tell all my secrets?
No, sorry. Don't work that way.

335
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,000
Now, you tell me ...

336
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:05,599
some information about yourself,
and l will tell you about Cora.

337
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,900
l'm deaf.

338
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,099
l wear a hearing aid. When l don't want
to listen to something, l turn it off.

339
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,000
And l can hardly hear anything.

340
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,800
Were you born that way?

341
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,199
No.

342
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Can l ask you how it happened?
- No, you can't.

343
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,400
There's this story l read a while ago.

344
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,500
There is this very young,
very pretty nurse, named Cora.

345
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,699
And there is this 15 year-old boy ...

346
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,400
who had to have his appendix taken out.

347
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:14,300
And he was very ashamed
that she had to bathe him, and ...

348
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,400
shave him and bedpan him ...

349
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,199
Anytime she's in the room he can't talk.

350
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,699
She didn't take him seriously, thinks he's a
child. Treats him like a baby.

351
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:38,199
Eventually there's complications.
lnfection, high temperature ...

352
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:42,800
Then the boy ...

353
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,300
gets very weak and ...

354
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:53,800
He's dieing and Cora ...

355
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,400
sits next to his bed,

356
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,900
talking to him and singing to him,
and hell ...

357
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,000
He's dying and she comes up,
real close to him and she says,

358
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:13,400
''Don't leave me,
don't leave me, don't leave me.''

359
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
''Don't leave.''

360
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:21,400
And the boy dies.

361
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,000
With her name, Cora, on his lips.

362
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,900
And she realizes that she loves him.

363
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,900
What's that?

364
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,300
A wave measuring device.

365
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:01,800
Do you know how many waves
the rig has weathered since it was built?

366
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,000
5 million?

367
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:12,000
Not bad. 25.

368
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,400
See, and without a machine.

369
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,000
Just guessing.

370
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:25,599
lt also measures the water temperature.

371
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:29,199
Since they stopped drilling,
it's fallen 10 degrees.

372
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,699
Whole colonies of mussels
stuck to the rig legs, have been lost.

373
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:40,000
Tropical mussels brought by some current
that l haven,t been able to identify. Look.

374
00:44:54,699 --> 00:45:00,599
lf we didn't know how many waves this thing
could weather we couldn't keep it standing.

375
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,699
Do you think it would be much of a loss?

376
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,199
Simon, for God's sake, what is this shit?

377
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:32,699
Seems like
we're eating fucking shaving cream.

378
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,099
Liam, do you think this is real food?
What the bloody hell is it?

379
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,500
l hate cheese.

380
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:41,500
How many times do l got to tell you?

381
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:48,400
We're going to turn into fucking mice.
- l think it needs a pinch of nutmeg.

382
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,800
Very little nutmeg, Simon.
You always had a problem with that.

383
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,800
Heads up.

384
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:59,699
Do us some burgers with fried onions.

385
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,000
ls that so difficult?

386
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:05,900
You peel and onion and fry it.
You do the same with the burger.

387
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:09,000
Then you put Deep Purple on,
and it's that easy.

388
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:12,099
Or chops. Or a fucking steak!

389
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,599
l'm heartbroken, but l'm out of Deep Purple.
- What about the Kinks?

390
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,699
Anything like that.
- Def Leopard.

391
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:23,699
Def Leopard?
They're a band.

392
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:28,000
Stick you your cockles
in your mussels, Martin.

393
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,599
Something you can sing along to.
- Bleeding salads ...

394
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,900
l think it's the best thing l've ever eaten,
in my whole life.

395
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:53,500
Can you do this everyday?
- Yes, if you want.

396
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:58,199
Cause you know,
it's important to keep up appearances.

397
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,400
You never know who might show up here.

398
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,599
Queen of England.
Santa Claus.

399
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,400
l've got a headache.
- That's because of the fever.

400
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:21,000
Your temperature has gone up, today.

401
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,699
You're the one who sends it up.
Sorry.

402
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,400
l'll shut up. l'm not going
to bother you with my foolishness, today.

403
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:40,000
No? That's a pity.
Just when l was beginning to enjoy myself.

404
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,300
l imagine that you are 15 years old.

405
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:50,099
l'm exactly 3 times 15.
And you?

406
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,699
l dreamed about you,
a couple of times.

407
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:59,800
Don't worry. ln no way erotic.
- That's a shame.

408
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:07,400
Don't make me laugh, hurts too much.
What do you dream about, Cora?

409
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,800
You know, in Japan they've
invented this kind of a ...

410
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:22,000
cybernetic pillow that you can
use to program your dreams.

411
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,099
You tell the machine what you want to dream.

412
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:32,000
Say ... what ever you like.
Say, l want to dream of a ...

413
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,000
Sean Connery in Highland dress and ...

414
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,400
l want it to be at the North Pole,
so l can hide under his kilt.

415
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:46,699
And ... whatever, something like that,
and it works.

416
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,500
And that night you dream you're
at the North Pole under Sean Connery's kilt.

417
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,800
What would you dream about, Cora?

418
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Me?

419
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,400
Not wearing a kilt.

420
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:11,000
Not wearing anything at all.

421
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,400
Tropical island.

422
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,599
ln a huge hammock.

423
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:23,400
And there's room for both of us.
Are you listening?

424
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,599
Yes.

425
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,699
Our bodies cuddled up close to one another.

426
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,800
Sweat mixing.

427
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:37,500
Where nothing else matters.

428
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:41,199
Just you and me, Cora.

429
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,300
Just you and ...

430
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,300
Are you looking at me, Cora.
- No.

431
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,500
Are you sure?

432
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,099
l think you were.

433
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:32,400
You're starting to lie to me, now.

434
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,000
Means you like me a little bit.

435
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,900
l,m reading ''Letters of a Portuguese Nun,,,
again,  l know, it,s si l ly.

436
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,599
Reading that book,
l fee l  like  l,m ta lking to you.

437
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:23,800
May l?

438
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:29,699
Well, Ducasse in person.

439
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,800
Wow!

440
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:39,800
What? Do l look that good?

441
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:44,599
Better than ever.
lt's an improvement.

442
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,500
You remind me of Coyote after
a ton of anvils have fallen on top of him.

443
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:59,900
Really, you are somewhere
between Coyote and Mr. Magoo.

444
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:04,099
You're looking handsome yourself,
now that l'm blind.

445
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,199
Thank you.

446
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,000
What have you brought me?
- Open your mouth.

447
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:12,099
Ah, ha, here we go.

448
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,199
Okay.

449
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:39,500
Have l ever told you that l love you?
- Yeah, but l know it's just for the sex.

450
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:41,699
Come on, another.

451
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,500
Did she ask you to come?
- Who?

452
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,099
Simon.
- No, l wanted to.

453
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,699
She didn't say anything to you?
- You know, she doesn't talk much.

454
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,000
What she like?

455
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,699
ls she a looker?
- Go to hell.

456
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,000
Sensitive!
You like her.

457
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,500
You like her, don't you?

458
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:21,599
l,m thinking of
devoting a day to Ethiopian cooking.

459
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,500
Dried meat and overcooked ...
- What are you talking about?

460
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:27,199
Shut up.

461
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,000
You're changing the subject.

462
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:33,699
lt's okay ...
- Josef, really, you are boring me.

463
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,800
Do you want some more?
- lt's okay that you like her.

464
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,599
You've been here for a month.

465
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,300
l'm sure she doesn't have
a husband or a boyfriend. lt's cool.

466
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:50,400
Of course. A woman who's free,
without any ties, wouldn't interest you.

467
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,099
Get the fuck out of here.

468
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:01,000
l have fruit salad or ...

469
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:04,500
Just go.
Get out of here.

470
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:22,500
Hey, Hanna, Hanna.

471
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:27,800
Want to see a picture of my family?
- Alright.

472
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,900
That's my wife Shirley. Tom.

473
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,099
Anna, and Amy.

474
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:39,099
She'll be 2 next month.

475
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,300
She's very pretty.

476
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:49,300
Kids are great, don't you think?

477
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:53,099
Yes.

478
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,900
Scott, he's got two daughters.
- Two?

479
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,800
Life is strange.

480
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,199
Yes.

481
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,900
Yes, a lot.

482
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,699
l love you ...
- Josef,  l  love you.

483
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,800
Like that Portuguese nun, even more.

484
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:08,800
Much more. Come on, ca l l me.

485
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,500
Ca l l me,  l know, it's not easy ...

486
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,300
lt's alright, l'm not sleeping.

487
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,000
l've been waiting for you.

488
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,599
Martin showed me ...

489
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,800
l don't want to hear
about anything from the outside.

490
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:06,699
You tell me something then ...
about yourself.

491
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,500
Can you keep a secret?
- Yes.

492
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:11,300
Are you sure you can keep a secret?
- Yes.

493
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,599
Alright.

494
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:17,300
l'll tell you but lean in close.
l've got to whisper it in your ear.

495
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:21,599
One.

496
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,500
Lean in closer so l can tell you.

497
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,500
Closer.

498
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,300
Are you connected?
- Yes.

499
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:45,199
l can't swim.

500
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,599
Ow.

501
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,000
lt,s pretty ridiculous, isn,t it?

502
00:59:03,699 --> 00:59:07,300
Alright, that's enough.
lt's not that funny.

503
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:10,300
lt's just that ... with ...

504
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:17,500
With ... working here it seems a bit strange.
- What ... ow.

505
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,000
People aren't lining up
to jump off the diving board of the oil rig.

506
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,199
lt's not an aquatic park, yet.

507
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:33,500
Never was good in the water.

508
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:41,300
There was this television series
when l was a kid.

509
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,000
You probably haven't heard of it,
it's about a submarine.

510
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:49,000
lt was called
''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,,.

511
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:52,400
And there was always these ...

512
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,000
There was this great noise
that the submarine made. lt went ...

513
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,400
l can,t do it. lt was something like ...

514
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,199
l was fascinated with this series, l ...

515
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:14,699
l had nightmares that
there were sea monsters coming after me.

516
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,500
One summer my parents decided,
''We,re going to do a beach holiday,,.

517
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:23,099
Everything was alright, for a while.

518
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:29,099
l made sure my parents didn,t realize
l wasn,t going anywhere near that water.

519
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,300
lt terrified me.
l couldn,t even go down to the water,s edge.

520
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,400
l couldn't even put my toe in,
because l was convinced ...

521
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:42,300
that these monsters were there,
waiting for me.

522
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:48,199
l was just busy building sand castles.

523
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,800
So, one day ...

524
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,699
my dad decides to rent a paddle-boat, and ...

525
01:00:56,199 --> 01:01:00,500
he got really angry, because
l wasn,t going to go on the paddle-boat,

526
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:04,300
because l was very busy with my sand castes.

527
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:09,300
He got furious and
he scooped me up and forced me on it.

528
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,000
And then he started to peddle furiously.

529
01:01:13,699 --> 01:01:17,300
With this kind of uncontrollable rage.

530
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:23,500
l was trembling, l was sobbing,
and he was saying,

531
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:29,500
''Spent 5 bucks on this. We're gonna have
a good time if it's the last thing we do!''

532
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:34,500
Before you know it,
we were pretty far away from the shore.

533
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:38,800
He stops pedaling, and ...

534
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:44,400
he stands up and he says something like ...

535
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,500
l,ve no idea what he said.

536
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:49,900
Picks me up ...

537
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,699
and he throws me in the water.

538
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,800
l start sinking to the bottom.

539
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,199
l keep going deeper,
and deeper, and deeper down.

540
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,599
And there, l swear, Cora.

541
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:11,000
There's this big,
black, gelatinous ... something.

542
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,400
lt had these big bulging eyes, and ...

543
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,500
tentacles.

544
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,000
And it saw me.

545
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,599
And it started coming after me.

546
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,400
And that was the last thing l remember.

547
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:37,099
l woke up in a hospital bed ...

548
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,500
You know what?

549
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:50,800
My father ...

550
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,800
When he ... when he threw me in the water.

551
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,599
He didn't know how to swim either.

552
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:20,199
Dr. Sulitzer?
Yes ...

553
01:03:21,699 --> 01:03:27,900
Well, we don't have that much to do, so ...
No, it's fine. lt's okay. Just waiting.

554
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,699
Hanna, the nurse here,
she wants to have a word with you.

555
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,400
Okay.

556
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,199
Hello.

557
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,900
Yes, no ... He's stable but he's ...

558
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,300
The problem is,
he isn't getting any better, so ...

559
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:52,500
He still is running a high fever.
lt comes in waves, morning, mid-afternoon.

560
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:57,900
l think he should be taken off the oil rig.

561
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,599
No, immediately.

562
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,599
The day after tomorrow?

563
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:08,900
You'll speak to ...

564
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,599
Okay. Good bye.

565
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,400
l think Sulitzer is looking for another job.

566
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:18,800
Aren't you?

567
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:24,000
The company can move me to another rig.
Maybe in ...

568
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,400
Chile, or Cuba.
Who knows?

569
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:34,599
Meanwhile, l stay here.
As long as they want.

570
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:40,900
l get edgy on dry land. l get ...

571
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,800
Dizzy.
- The accident?

572
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,900
How did it happen?
- You really want to know that?

573
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:57,199
They were drilling in ground that's like ...

574
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,199
Cheese with holes ... Swiss cheese.

575
01:05:01,699 --> 01:05:04,500
There are pockets of gas, down there.

576
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:10,900
And we hit one.
lt's not the first time it's happened.

577
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:14,900
Could it have been avoided?
- No. No.

578
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:20,000
Yes, maybe, if we'd
stopped drilling a long time ago. But ...

579
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:25,699
What happened to the man who died,
was no accident.

580
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:31,800
That man wanted to kill himself.
He threw himself into the flames.

581
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,400
Sorry.

582
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,099
So ... and ...

583
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,199
Josef, he tried to save him, but ...

584
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,900
lt all happened so quickly.

585
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,199
We all saw how he threw himself into the ...
into the blaze.

586
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:03,000
We haven't told the company everything.
We let them believe it was an accident.

587
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:07,500
That man left a wife and 2 kids.

588
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,099
So, what's the point in telling the truth?

589
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,699
Let them believe it was an accident.
That means some money for his family.

590
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,699
And ...

591
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,400
Deep down ...

592
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:28,500
everything is an accident.

593
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:35,099
He never speaks about him.
- Doesn't he?

594
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,400
Well ...

595
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,699
Hanna?
- Yes.

596
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,699
What?
- Nothing.

597
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,300
Yes?

598
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,500
Nothin'.
- What?

599
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:06,900
No, nothin'.

600
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,900
Oh, come on.

601
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,199
Nothing.
- Simon?

602
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,599
What?

603
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,199
Nothing.

604
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,699
No, what?

605
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,900
What?

606
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:33,199
Hanna?

607
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,699
Hanna?
- Yes.

608
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,500
Look at this!

609
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:53,199
Remember that you're not 15 years old.

610
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,000
Bodalo.
- What?

611
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,500
What do you think l just said?

612
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,699
ldiot? Dickhead? A little of both?

613
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,699
More or less, yes.

614
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,399
Which language?
- What difference does it make?

615
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:24,000
Here we go. Aren't you getting tired of
playing the mystery woman act with me?

616
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,300
Do you want more soup?

617
01:08:29,699 --> 01:08:33,199
Come on, l've told you my little miseries.

618
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,899
Tell me something.
No, l'm full up on soup.

619
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,699
Did you like ''Letters of a Portuguese Nun''?

620
01:08:52,699 --> 01:08:56,500
l thought you didn't like books,
just chicken and rice.

621
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,699
l used to read.

622
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:04,699
Yeah, well.
l don't remember it all that well.

623
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,300
Read it ages ago.
lt's a short book.

624
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:16,100
l only read short books.
Don't have patience for long ones.

625
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:21,399
Gave that book as a present to someone, once.

626
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,399
A woman.

627
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,500
l know l shouldn't have, but l did.
- Why?

628
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,100
Because it was another man's wife.

629
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:39,699
A man who loved her,

630
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,199
and whom she loved.

631
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,500
And who even l loved.

632
01:09:56,899 --> 01:10:00,800
There's certain things one should never do.

633
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,500
Like what?

634
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,399
One should never ...

635
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,899
give a book as a present to someone
who spends too much time alone.

636
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:18,300
One should never fall in love
with one's best friend's wife.

637
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,399
Above all,
one should never tell one's best friend.

638
01:10:39,699 --> 01:10:46,199
lt's terrible to tempt compassion.
lt's the last thing l want to arouse in you.

639
01:10:47,899 --> 01:10:50,399
Cora?
- Yes.

640
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:57,199
How does one live with what has happened?

641
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:02,100
The consequences.

642
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:09,000
How does one live with the dead?

643
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:19,000
l don't know.
You'll have to go on, l suppose.

644
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,199
Everyone keeps on living for the future,
some how.

645
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,100
Or not.

646
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,699
There are those who don't make it through.

647
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:45,699
A helicopter is coming to fetch you.
Tomorrow, or the day after.

648
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,399
Are you coming with me? Are you?

649
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,500
You gonna hold my hand?
Help me look at myself again?

650
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,600
l've  lost at  love before

651
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:20,399
Got mad and c losed the door

652
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,899
But you said try just once more

653
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,500
l chose you for the one

654
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,399
Now we're having so much fun

655
01:12:30,699 --> 01:12:32,800
you treated me so kind

656
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,199
l'm about to  lose my mind

657
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:39,899
you make me so very happy

658
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:47,399
l'm so g lad you came into my  life

659
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,500
The others were untrue

660
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,500
But when it came to  lovin'you

661
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:04,300
l'd spend my who le  life with you

662
01:13:04,899 --> 01:13:07,300
Cause you came and you took contro l

663
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:09,699
you touched my very sou l

664
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:12,000
you a/ways showed me that

665
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,300
Loving you is where it's at

666
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:19,300
you make me so very happy

667
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:28,199
l'm so g lad you came into my  life

668
01:13:35,899 --> 01:13:39,500
Don't you like the show?

669
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,000
l've seen it before.

670
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:48,600
Who do you work for, Martin?

671
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,199
The company.

672
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,199
And the company pays you
to check on the mussels?

673
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:01,300
The company pays me to measure
the wave impact strength, l told you.

674
01:14:02,199 --> 01:14:04,300
The mussels are my business.

675
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:14,100
Sometimes l forget that we're out at sea.
- No, we aren't in limbo.

676
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:17,699
We're up to our necks in water.

677
01:14:18,899 --> 01:14:21,199
Do you know what the problem is?

678
01:14:21,699 --> 01:14:23,699
The people think it's the oil.

679
01:14:23,899 --> 01:14:27,500
But it's not true.
lt's the water that we bring out with it.

680
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:33,399
For millions of years it rubbed shoulders
with the oil, stuck at the bottom of the sea.

681
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:39,600
You see, when we crack the water from the oil
and return it to the sea, it's shitty water.

682
01:14:39,699 --> 01:14:46,000
lt corrupts everything it touches. You know
what's happened to the fish that live here?

683
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:50,000
Contact with this water
has altered their hormones.

684
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:54,699
lt's delayed spawning. Colder currents
sweep the eggs away before they can hatch.

685
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:00,300
They're shutting down, anyway.
- Not if l can help it.

686
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,000
What will you do?

687
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,699
This could be used for lots of things.

688
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,800
Use the drilling motors to purge the water.
lt's possible to cleanse the water.

689
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,399
What will happen
if nobody takes any notice of you?

690
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,899
Well, l'll keep on measuring waves.

691
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:23,500
Collecting mussels.

692
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:30,300
And l'll keep thinking
that something can be done.

693
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,100
l envy you, Martin.

694
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,899
Really, l ... l didn't know
there were still people like you about.

695
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:52,600
l wish you luck.

696
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:22,000
How did you pass the night?
- The night?

697
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:28,199
l don't know.
Lousy, l guess.

698
01:17:30,199 --> 01:17:32,699
What time is it?
- 12. Are you hungry?

699
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,500
No.

700
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,100
When l was studying in Dubrovnik,

701
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:44,699
l always dreaded
when we had to clean the patients.

702
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,300
l felt ...

703
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:51,000
l felt uncomfortable.

704
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:55,000
Just thinking that they were uncomfortable.

705
01:17:55,899 --> 01:17:57,300
But ...

706
01:17:57,399 --> 01:18:02,600
l soon realized that ...
people like being clean.

707
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:07,699
No matter how you do it, or ...

708
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:14,000
or who does it.
They like being in your hands.

709
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,000
They like trusting you with their bodies.

710
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:23,199
As if they were saying, ''lt's only a body.''

711
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:29,100
''lt's only a body.
You'll never know what l am thinking,

712
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:32,800
or who l am.''

713
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:40,300
l had a ...

714
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:45,000
l had a friend who studied with me.

715
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,500
We got on very well.

716
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:55,199
She was ...
She was so cheerful.

717
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:02,000
l've never been cheerful.

718
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:08,500
l was so proud to be her friend.

719
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:14,500
We used to read all the same books
and stay up, late into the night,

720
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:19,100
just talking about them.
The books were always more real than ...

721
01:19:19,399 --> 01:19:22,500
More real than anything else.

722
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,899
We lived together during the war, and ...

723
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,600
We were 20 years old
when they closed the school.

724
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,800
And we decided to go back to the town
where we were both from.

725
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:44,800
We couldn't get in touch with our families.
They said terrible things were happening.

726
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:50,300
But you know, nobody really believed them.
l mean ...

727
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:56,300
People always exaggerate.
lt couldn't be true, l mean, war ...

728
01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:00,600
Somehow it always happens somewhere else.

729
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:06,500
So we borrowed a car, she could drive,
and we ...

730
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,300
We set off.

731
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:16,399
Nothing happened on the journey.
We saw ...

732
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:22,500
We saw fires far off, and ... dead dogs.

733
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,199
Nothing.

734
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:29,300
Lots of dead dogs.

735
01:20:31,699 --> 01:20:36,300
We listened to this
cassette of ltalian disco music.

736
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,399
And we laughed.

737
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,000
We laughed so much on that journey.

738
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:54,500
Do you remember, there was this song called,
La Do lce Vita?

739
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,800
lt was so stupid. lt was ...

740
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:03,300
We're  livin'  like a Do lce Vita

741
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
This time we got it right

742
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:09,399
We're  livin'  like a Do lce Vita

743
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:12,100
Got a dream ...

744
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,899
They stopped us just
2 kilometers from the town.

745
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:25,100
They took us to a hotel.

746
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:30,399
We thought they just wanted to steal the car.

747
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,800
We were very worried about
how we would explain this to the owner.

748
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:43,399
lt's ridiculous, isn't it?

749
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:48,300
Your whole life is about to ...

750
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,000
change ...

751
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:56,000
And you are worrying about an old Fiat Turbo.

752
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,699
The soldiers were our soldiers.

753
01:22:06,699 --> 01:22:11,100
They were soldiers, they spoke like me,
they spoke my own language.

754
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:19,199
Some of them were only 18 years old.

755
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:26,199
l remember, one day,
UN troops were brought in, and ...

756
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,899
We thought that day
that they were going to take us out of there.

757
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:35,800
No.

758
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:41,199
Voices like yours, Josef.

759
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:43,399
Talking like you.

760
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,699
l remember that one of them ...

761
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,300
apologized all the time.
He would apologize ...

762
01:22:56,899 --> 01:22:59,000
while smiling.

763
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,300
lf you can imagine that they ...

764
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:10,300
rape you, time and again, and whisper
in your ears, so only you can hear ...

765
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,500
l'm sorry, l'm so sorry.

766
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:15,000
Forgive me.

767
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:22,100
There were 15 of us women.

768
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:27,100
Sometimes more. We knew that when
the food ran out, they'd kill some of us.

769
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,800
They made a woman kill her daughter.

770
01:23:32,899 --> 01:23:37,300
They put a gun in her hand
and her finger on the trigger.

771
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:44,500
They put the barrel of the gun in the girl's
vagina. They made her pull that trigger.

772
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:50,899
Saying something like,
now you're not going to be a grandmother.

773
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,699
Something like that.

774
01:23:53,899 --> 01:24:00,300
So, the woman died soon after, of sorrow.

775
01:24:03,699 --> 01:24:06,800
One day dawned and she had died of sorrow.

776
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,600
Know what they did
to the ones who dared to scream?

777
01:24:12,899 --> 01:24:15,000
They said ...

778
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,500
''Now we are really going to
give you reasons for screaming.''

779
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:25,899
And they made hundreds of cuts
all over their bodies, with a knife.

780
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:31,899
And they rubbed salt in the wounds and
sewed up deeper cuts with sewing needles.

781
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:37,100
That's what they did to my friend.

782
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,199
And l couldn't ...

783
01:24:44,699 --> 01:24:48,600
They wouldn't let me clean her wounds, so ...

784
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,300
She slowly bled to death.

785
01:24:55,199 --> 01:25:00,300
lt was just so ...
lt was so slowly.

786
01:25:01,699 --> 01:25:05,500
And the blood ran down her arms,
and her legs.

787
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,199
l just prayed that she would die quickly.

788
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:13,600
l counted the screams.

789
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,800
The moans, l measured ...
l measured the pain.

790
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:25,800
And l thought ...
''She can't suffer anymore.''

791
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:30,600
''Now she'll die.''

792
01:25:31,899 --> 01:25:36,100
''Now. Please.''

793
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:39,699
''The very next minute, please.''

794
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,600
What was her name?

795
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,500
Your friend.

796
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,699
What was her name?

797
01:28:20,699 --> 01:28:23,199
Hanna.

798
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,100
Hanna?

799
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,899
Hanna!

800
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,600
Hanna!

801
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,600
Hanna!

802
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:35,100
Josef.

803
01:31:35,899 --> 01:31:38,899
Your bag.
- That's not mine.

804
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,300
lt's yours.

805
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,399
Would you come with me?

806
01:34:52,899 --> 01:34:57,699
Did you have a good trip? Do sit down.
- Yes, thank you.

807
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:03,100
ls this your first time in Copenhagen?
- Yes, it's quite nice.

808
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:05,500
lt's lovely.

809
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,300
What do you need from me?

810
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:16,800
Well, l've been thinking about what
l would say to you this entire journey.

811
01:35:17,399 --> 01:35:19,800
l'm not quite sure.

812
01:35:20,199 --> 01:35:24,899
As l told you on the phone,
l met Hanna when she was my nurse.

813
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:29,399
l never really ... got to see her.

814
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,000
Do you want a photo of her,
see if she's as beautiful as her voice?

815
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,800
No.
- No.

816
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,600
You wouldn't have come
all this way just for a photograph.

817
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:47,399
l was Hanna's councilor for 2 years.

818
01:35:47,699 --> 01:35:51,000
Since then l receive
a phone call, from time to time.

819
01:35:51,399 --> 01:35:57,100
She doesn't speak, she doesn't say anything,
but l know it's her, l know she's alive.

820
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:03,500
Why doesn't she say anything?
- That's between Hanna and me.

821
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:10,399
She ... she told me something.

822
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:15,800
About what happened ... in the hotel.

823
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,399
She must have trusted you.
- But l know ...

824
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:25,500
l know, don't ask me how or why,
but l know ...

825
01:36:25,699 --> 01:36:29,600
There's something she didn't tell me.
And many things ..

826
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:33,399
she didn't tell me, and l want to know.

827
01:36:33,699 --> 01:36:38,800
And you want me to tell you.
Haven't you had your ration of horror?

828
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,000
What do you want?

829
01:36:41,399 --> 01:36:46,500
What do you really want? Didn't you read
the newspaper during those 10 years of war?

830
01:36:49,399 --> 01:36:53,300
What? l don't know.

831
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,500
l think l want ...

832
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:03,899
to spend the rest of my life with her.

833
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:07,500
Oh, the rest of your life.

834
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,600
How romantic.

835
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:16,800
The rest of your life with a refugee
from a war that everybody has forgotten?

836
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:20,300
With a woman you've never even seen?

837
01:37:21,399 --> 01:37:25,000
With a woman that you
only know has suffered things ...

838
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:28,300
neither your nor l could bear?

839
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:35,699
Have you ever thought that what Hanna needs,
most of all, is to be left alone?

840
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:40,800
Yeah. Yeah, l've thought about that.

841
01:37:41,699 --> 01:37:46,199
But ... l know she needs me.

842
01:37:48,199 --> 01:37:49,699
And l need her.

843
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:52,500
l know it.

844
01:37:57,899 --> 01:38:00,199
Come with me.

845
01:38:12,699 --> 01:38:15,100
This is Hanna Amiran.

846
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:19,600
Here is everything you want to know.

847
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:23,500
But, even if you
really feel the way you say you do,

848
01:38:23,699 --> 01:38:26,699
does that give you
the right to see this tape?

849
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,699
Without her consent?

850
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:34,000
Do you know how many Hannas there are here?

851
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:38,699
Do you know how much blood?
How many deaths?

852
01:38:40,699 --> 01:38:44,199
Do you know how much hatred these tapes hold?

853
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:51,300
Do you know why we record them?
- No, why?

854
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:57,600
Before the Holocaust, Adolph Hitler
called his collaborators together,

855
01:38:57,699 --> 01:39:02,399
and in order to convince them
that he could get away with his plan,

856
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:07,000
he asked them, ''Who remembers
the extermination of the Armenians?''

857
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:08,699
That's what he said.

858
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:11,199
30 years later,

859
01:39:11,399 --> 01:39:16,800
nobody remembered the million Armenians
exterminated in the cruelest possible way.

860
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,500
10 years later ...

861
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:23,199
Who remembers what happened in the Balkans?

862
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:26,500
The survivors.

863
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:33,699
Those who managed,
by some twist of fate, to tell it.

864
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,500
lf they can.

865
01:39:38,899 --> 01:39:41,100
Those who are ashamed ...

866
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:45,899
of having survived.

867
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:47,600
Like Hanna.

868
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,300
That's the irony of it,
if you can call it that.

869
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:56,899
The shame they feel
for having managed to survive.

870
01:39:58,699 --> 01:40:00,399
And that shame,

871
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,800
which is greater than the pain,
which is bigger than anything else,

872
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,300
can last forever.

873
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,899
l believe l have a photograph of Hanna,
somewhere.

874
01:40:57,399 --> 01:40:58,600
Hanna.

875
01:40:58,800 --> 01:40:59,800
Hanna.

876
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:07,500
l knew you were blond.

877
01:41:09,699 --> 01:41:12,600
l came to bring you your backpack.

878
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:13,699
Thanks.

879
01:41:15,699 --> 01:41:18,699
You have done it, now you can go.

880
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:29,399
l ... l took a bar of soap.
Hope you don't mind.

881
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,500
No, l have lots.

882
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:40,899
lt's a nice scar that you've got.

883
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:49,100
Yeah, well, they said it won't look so bad,
after a while.

884
01:41:51,399 --> 01:41:56,600
They also told me that the nurse
that took care of me did a real good job.

885
01:41:56,699 --> 01:41:58,300
Good.

886
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,100
They shut down the rig.

887
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,399
Where is everyone going?
- They offered us work in Chile.

888
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:13,899
Simon is going to go back
and try the restaurant business.

889
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:18,300
Chile.
- l haven't decided what to do.

890
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:21,600
Still thinking about it.

891
01:42:22,899 --> 01:42:24,000
Good.

892
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:29,899
l thought ... you and l ...

893
01:42:30,899 --> 01:42:35,199
Maybe we could go away somewhere, together.

894
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,800
One of these days. Today.

895
01:42:39,899 --> 01:42:43,300
Right now.

896
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,699
Come with me, Hanna.

897
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,100
No, l ...

898
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:59,399
l don't think that's going to be possible.
- Why not?

899
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:11,899
Because l think that if we go away,
to someplace together ...

900
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,699
l am afraid that, one day ...

901
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:18,000
Maybe not today ...

902
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,300
Maybe not tomorrow either,
but one day, suddenly ...

903
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:31,300
l may begin to cry and cry so much
that nothing and nobody can stop me.

904
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:34,899
And the tears will fill the room,
l won,t be able to breathe,

905
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:39,600
and l will pull you down with me,
and we,ll both drown.

906
01:43:40,699 --> 01:43:42,300
l'll learn how to swim.

907
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,000
l swear.

908
01:43:49,899 --> 01:43:51,699
l'll learn how to swim.

909
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,300
l left a long time ago.

910
01:45:23,399 --> 01:45:29,500
Only sometimes, in these Sunday mornings,
when he's buying the papers and the bread.

911
01:45:29,899 --> 01:45:35,199
And she hears her children shouting from the
house next door, where they've gone to play.

912
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:38,500
Yes, yes she has 2 children now.

913
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,399
My brothers.

914
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:45,699
These cool and sunny winter mornings
when she has the house to herself.

915
01:45:45,899 --> 01:45:49,699
And she feels strange and fragile and empty.

916
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:53,600
And for a moment
she doesn't know it all has been a dream.

917
01:45:54,600 --> 01:46:00,100
Then l come back to her
and she cuddles me and strokes my hair.

918
01:46:00,199 --> 01:46:05,300
And nothing, nothing at all what happened
will ever come between us.

919
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:10,600
But l can hear the children coming back.
l go away.

920
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,000
l'm far away, now.

921
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:17,300
Perhaps, l'll never come back.
