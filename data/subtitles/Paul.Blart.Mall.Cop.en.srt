1
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,280
Let's go! Move it!

2
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,520
50 more yards!

3
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,920
All right, let's go! Pick it up!

4
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,360
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

5
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,000
You're running out of time, Bryant!

6
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,800
Make it all the way around the track!
Come on!

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,680
You want to be troopers?
You better move it!

8
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,200
All right, next, get up here!

9
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,640
Let's hit it now.

10
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
Dean, come on!

11
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,920
All right.
You've all completed the written exam.

12
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,440
However, you must now pass
the obstacle course

13
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,960
to be admitted into the training program.

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,800
And remember, survive this,

15
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,760
and you're on the front lines
of keeping New Jersey safe.

16
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,360
Yeah.

17
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,520
Sorry about the test, Dad.

18
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,520
We all have our crosses to bear, sweetheart.

19
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
Mine is named hypoglycemia.

20
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,080
Well, that's why you always have to have
sugar nearby.

21
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,960
Are you gonna have pie?

22
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,480
Not tonight, Ma.

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I'm gonna want some pie.

24
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,960
You...

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
No, I meant now, Ma. Get the pie now.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,880
- Okay.
- You said it,

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,320
and I just kind of got that
stuck in my head now,

28
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,360
and can't really get it out. Pie. Here we go.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
It really helps heal.

30
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,440
And, you know, not always, but sometimes,

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,920
you gotta do like the kids say,
and just say, "Whatever."

32
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,120
Kids don't talk like that.

33
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,360
Some do, sweetheart. The older ones, okay?

34
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,760
I hear them in the mall. You know?

35
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
Peanut butter.

36
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,240
It just fills the cracks of the heart.

37
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,040
Go away, pain.

38
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,280
- What?
- Paulie.

39
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,360
Oh, no. Come on, Ma.

40
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,120
I'm not ready for this right now.

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
- Dad.
- Please.

42
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,280
We just don't want to see you go through
another holiday alone.

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,920
But I'm not alone.

44
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,800
I've got you two. You know?

45
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,440
And besides, Black Friday's coming,

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,920
so my dance card's gonna be pretty full.

47
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,720
What?
It's the busiest shopping day of the year.

48
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,160
Yeah, I should have known better
than to try to explain it to civilians.

49
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,200
I wish I had a coworker here, like, "Tyler,
hey. You know, Black Friday's coming."

50
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,960
"Gee, Paul, you don't have to tell me
Black Friday's coming.

51
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
"Why do you think
I've been walking around here

52
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,320
"with the eyes of an eagle?"

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,760
- We prepare.
- Dad, what does all that have to do

54
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
with being happy for the rest of your life?

55
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,440
You said, and I quote,
"lf I don't have a girlfriend by November,

56
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,680
"I'll let you sign me up
for perfectmatch.com."

57
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,360
That was last year.

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Okay.

59
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,440
- Here we are.
- Okay.

60
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,000
"What are you looking for in a woman?"

61
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,040
Well, your mother certainly
had something special.

62
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,520
Yeah, illegal immigrant status.

63
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,080
She married you, got citizenship,
and then she left us.

64
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,040
That's not entirely true.

65
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,000
We did have some good times
back when she was still trying to trick me.

66
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,240
- Well, I hate her.
- Well, you shouldn't.

67
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,840
She gave me you.

68
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,000
- I am pretty great.
- You are. You are.

69
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,040
Okay, next question.
"Tell us about yourself."

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,520
Let's see.

71
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,920
I know a lot about sharks.

72
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,080
Let me stop you right there.

73
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,520
Well- built and a great hugger.

74
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Awesome, Grandma.

75
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,200
Not as awesome as this.

76
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,480
What are you doing?

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,760
Beefing up your profile with that
nifty video that you made a few years back.

78
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,120
Ma, no.

79
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,120
I don't know. Don't you think
it's a little too, "Hey, look at me"?

80
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,600
Well, that is exactly what we want.

81
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,080
Eyes on the prize.

82
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,240
And don't worry,
I will edit out the sweaty parts.

83
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,080
Dear God!

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,600
Hey! Back away from the vehicle.

85
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,920
Oh, dear God. Please.

86
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,960
Chompers, get down!

87
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,840
Hey, you know where a men's room is?

88
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,760
I do.
You're gonna want to go to Lord and Taylor.

89
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
They got 12 stalls and heated seats.

90
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,080
Okay, keep the balls in the pit, kids. Kids!

91
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,120
Okay, my lip is numb.

92
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,600
All righty.

93
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,280
- There you go.
- Thank you.

94
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Hey.

95
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,760
Yeah, I know.

96
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,720
That's not supposed to be here.
It's a minivan.

97
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,400
...he can't handle it.
The puck travels to the far board...

98
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,040
He keeps the play alive.

99
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,400
- Paul!
- Hey.

100
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,760
What is this?

101
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,040
That's my report on how to ease
traffic flow from Macy's

102
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
down through the specialty shops.

103
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,680
- How's that working out for you?
- Actually, it's for all of us.

104
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,080
You see, if we could reroute the customers
away from the food court,

105
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,040
it's gonna help the kiosks
and cut down on shopper frustration.

106
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,040
It's your classic two- bird,
one- stone scenario.

107
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,960
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

108
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,160
Why can't you just punch in, shut up
and punch out like the rest of us?

109
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Safety never takes a holiday.

110
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Did your mom crochet that on a pillow?

111
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,440
Blart.

112
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,880
This is Sims. He's a new trainee.
Let him trail you today.

113
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,120
Hey. Paul Blart. Ten- year veteran.

114
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,360
Wow. Veck Sims.

115
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,760
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.
Let's mount up.

116
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.

117
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,440
That's it. Treat her gentle, son.

118
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,640
Slap it, honor it.

119
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,000
So what made you want to pursue security?

120
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,560
I never finished high school.
This is all I could get.

121
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,040
Yeah, I'm currently working on becoming
a state trooper, myself.

122
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Right now, I'm goose egg for eight.
Hypoglycemia.

123
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,240
Confusing, right? Cut yourself some slack.

124
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,640
My first week riding on the job,
I got lost behind the Sears.

125
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,520
They found me later in the fetal position,
sporting a full beard.

126
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,120
I'm kidding. I can't grow a beard.

127
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,080
My uncle can. Stay snug.

128
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,600
Now, in the event
that you approach an assailant,

129
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,400
here's what I want you to do.
You're gonna pull up,

130
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,960
Ieft hip forward, placing your right hand
on your away hip thusly,

131
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,000
giving the illusion that you have a gun.
Which, of course, we both know

132
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,360
you don't.

133
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,560
Okay? But you know what we do have?

134
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,120
Our voices! We have our voices.

135
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,400
If you remember one thing
from today, it's this.

136
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,920
The mind is the only weapon
that doesn't need a holster.

137
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,200
Right. Awesome.
How long do we get for lunch?

138
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,360
Half hour. But I eat in 20, which leaves me
five minutes for social time,

139
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,560
five minutes to get refocused.

140
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,600
We got a high roller.

141
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,000
Sir, I'm gonna need you to pull to the right.

142
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,440
Please pull to the side, sir. Out of traffic.

143
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,480
Tan jacket, red scooter,
please pull to the right, out of traffic.

144
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Sir.

145
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
Thank you.

146
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,240
Driving kind of recklessly back there, sir.

147
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
You're kidding.

148
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,400
I don't joke about shopper safety.

149
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
issue you a citation.

150
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,960
Gonna need your first and last. Last first.

151
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,920
Sir. Sir. Sir, sir, sir.

152
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,240
Please don't make this more difficult
than it needs to be, okay?

153
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,680
Are you able to...
Sir. Sir! Sir. I am warning you, sir.

154
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,560
You're pushing it.

155
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,560
Sir. Sir. I am warning... Sir.

156
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,880
Sir. Sir. Sir.

157
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Okay.

158
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
This is adding up, sir. He'll be back.
He'll be back. He'll be back.

159
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,040
- Hey.
- Hi. Do you need something?

160
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,440
Yes. I'd like to welcome you to our mall.

161
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,680
Well, thank you.

162
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,080
Is there something else?

163
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,160
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

164
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,200
Just looking for some hair extensions.

165
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Need a little more volume up top.
Do you do men?

166
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,400
Do you do men hair? Do you do men hair?
On the men?

167
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,320
Are you the guy
that crashed into the minivan?

168
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,560
I don't think so. Which one?

169
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,200
Well, that one. That one right there.

170
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,400
Yeah. That one, yes. That...
You know, that one was me.

171
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,600
- Oh, wow. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah. Never better.

172
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,400
Although they're docking the paycheck
pretty good.

173
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,800
Yeah.

174
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,080
You know what you should do?
You should get the security tape,

175
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,560
and then, like, sell it to one of those shows,
you know, where people crash into stuff.

176
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,320
- Hello, early retirement.
- Yeah, right?

177
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,200
Volume. Right, let me just see what I've got.

178
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,320
Yeah, this is Blart.
If you need me, I'm over by the kiosks.

179
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,440
Who is this?

180
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,920
It's Officer Blart, reporting from Sector 5.

181
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
What the hell are you bothering me for?

182
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,640
- Just a Code B check.
- What a moron.

183
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,480
You know, I'll check in with them later.
It's pretty intense.

184
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,280
Oh, right, yeah. Life of a security guard.

185
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,280
- What, what?
- No, it's just that you said security guard,

186
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,720
and it's perfectly acceptable...

187
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,440
I'm so sorry if I called you the wrong thing.

188
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,160
No, no, no, no. You did fine, you know?

189
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,400
It's just that there's a huge,
huge controversy

190
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,680
brewing in the industry right now,

191
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,200
whether the title should be
Security Guard or Officer.

192
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,320
I'm sure you heard about it.

193
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
- I didn't.
- You will. You're gonna.

194
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,320
- But I'm sure I will.
- It's out there.

195
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,680
So, you all set
for the busiest shopping day of the year?

196
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,640
Yeah, right.
And the worst day for a birthday.

197
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,080
This year, it falls on a Black Friday, which
means I probably won't even get a card.

198
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,240
Everyone's too busy shopping.

199
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,400
You know what? Yeah. Autumn Ash.

200
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,760
- Yeah.
- I think that's your color.

201
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,360
- I think this'll work.
- It's a winner.

202
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,760
- So that's $9.95.
- $9.95?

203
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,320
- Yeah.
- Wow.

204
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,480
At those prices,
now you got me thinking ponytail.

205
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,160
All right. Thank you.

206
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,080
Thank you.

207
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,560
- Right. So there you go.
- Okay.

208
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,720
And, there you go.

209
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,120
Thank you, Amy.

210
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
Thank you, Officer Blart.

211
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,560
Hey, Blart. Wow, nice shirt.

212
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,480
You went with a medium?

213
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
It's a bit formfitting,

214
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,040
but that's 'cause we're required to wear
protective vests under our...

215
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,680
No. Not buying it. No.

216
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
'Cause I don't see any vest
underneath here, so...

217
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,240
No, but it's a thick T- shirt.
Basically like a thermal they have you wear.

218
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,480
Nope. Nope. No.

219
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,440
I don't understand why you're laughing.
I just called you fat.

220
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm not laughing.

221
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,720
Yeah, whatever. Amy.

222
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,760
Hey, everyone's going to American Joe's
tonight, and I want to see you there.

223
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,960
Okay?
We're gonna split some onion strings.

224
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,880
Wow. Wow.

225
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Good.

226
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,880
Good hang.

227
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,400
Wow, yeah. That's great.

228
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,120
Hey, Blart, they need you
at Victoria's Secret.

229
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,200
Okay, roger that.

230
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,600
Okay, I gotta go.

231
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,160
Okay. Bye.

232
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,680
- I found it first.
- No, you didn't.

233
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,920
Ladies. Problem.

234
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,600
What's the genesis?

235
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,720
She's trying to take
the last push- up bra in this size.

236
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,440
There's gonna be a new shipment tomorrow.
They'll be here by noon.

237
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,320
Well, I need this one now.
I have a date tonight.

238
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,320
Really? Is he blind?

239
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,080
Whoa!
Waterproof shoes and Baggies on the socks.

240
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,360
Not my first rodeo.

241
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,840
Okay, ladies, need to see some lD.

242
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,360
No, you don't.

243
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,960
Ma'am, I should warn you, I do have
the authority to make a citizen's arrest.

244
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,920
So does anyone.
I could arrest you right now.

245
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,440
- That's true. She could.
- Hey, not talking to you. Okay?

246
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,600
Can I see you for a second, please, ma'am?

247
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,360
Look, I understand your sensitivity.

248
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,280
I've had some issues with weight myself.

249
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,360
- Are you calling me fat?
- No. No, no, no, no.

250
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm just saying I've been down that road.

251
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,240
I mean... I mean, I'm still on it.
We both are, you know? Stranded.

252
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,720
Let's face it, we eat to fill a void, right?

253
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,040
But as soon as I started eating healthier,

254
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,240
I noticed I wasn't so moody.

255
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,800
And PS, your skin's gonna clear up.

256
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,240
- Can you hold onto these?
- Sure.

257
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,320
Ma'am.

258
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,360
You...

259
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,480
She's got tremendous upper body strength.

260
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,000
Backup! Backup!

261
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,400
She's biting my neck. She's biting my neck.

262
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,560
Backup!

263
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,760
Backup! Backup!

264
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,840
Look, I know you're new here and all,

265
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,360
but "backup" seems like
a pretty universal term.

266
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,080
Hey. Can I give you a lift?

267
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,480
What, on that?

268
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,680
With an inexperienced driver
I would recommend no,

269
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,720
but with me,
you'll be as safe as the President.

270
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,480
I don't know. Couldn't that get you fired?

271
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,040
Yes, it could.

272
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Okay.

273
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,360
- ls this all right?
- Absolutely.

274
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,680
And here you go. Safe and sound.

275
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,520
- '65 Mustang.
- Yeah.

276
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,360
Fun fact for you, a lot of people think
the Mustang was named after the horse.

277
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,040
It was actually named after
the P- 51 Mustang.

278
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,760
- That's a plane.
- I didn't know that.

279
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
Well, thank you for the ride, Paul.
That was so much fun.

280
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,640
No problem.

281
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,720
Listen,

282
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,680
if you ever, you know, need rides anywhere,

283
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,080
Dispatch, they can get me. You know.

284
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,800
- Or we could just text each other.
- Yeah.

285
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,960
- Yeah, give me your cell phone.
- My cell?

286
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,360
Yeah, and I'll punch my number in.

287
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,720
Left it in the casuals. You know what?

288
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,760
Just give me your number
and I'll remember it.

289
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,160
- Okay. Ready?
- Yep.

290
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,600
- All right. 555...
- Not yet. Just...

291
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,280
Now I'm ready.

292
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,840
- 555...
- 555...

293
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,080
- ...01...
- ...01...

294
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,600
- ...78.
- Eight. Got it.

295
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,760
That's it. It's locked.

296
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,000
Great, so I'll see you tonight
at American Joe's, right?

297
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,840
Yeah, I mean, everybody's going, so...

298
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,680
- Yeah.
- ...why not me, too? I'll be...

299
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,840
Yeah, I'm there.

300
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,120
- Great. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

301
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
- Hey.
- Hey! Hey. Glad you made it, Paul.

302
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,840
Good to be here.

303
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,320
- Fun fact for you...
- This place sucks.

304
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,040
- You want to get out of here?
- No.

305
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,760
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

306
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,640
No, I was just saying that

307
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,920
the first American Joe's actually opened
its doors in 1972.

308
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,200
And most people,
because of its service and theme,

309
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,200
think that it's derivative of Abe and Louie's,
but it's not.

310
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,080
It's its own thing.

311
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,080
You really know a lot of facts, Paul.

312
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,840
Hey, Blart, I heard you got your ass handed
to you by a fat chick at Victoria's Secret.

313
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,720
Well, I don't hit women,

314
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,160
- so I don't even know what...
- Yeah. Just minivans, right?

315
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,640
Hey, why don't you go over to the bar
and grab yourself one of those girly drinks?

316
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,120
- I'll meet you over there.
- Okay. Does anybody else want a drink?

317
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,440
- 'Cause Stuart's buying.
- No, no, no. They're good. They're good.

318
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,360
- So... They're good.
- Okay.

319
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,160
Hey, listen, l...
We're basically already together, so...

320
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,040
I wasn't... I didn't even realize that.

321
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,280
- And I was... I wouldn't... Doing anything.
- Yeah.

322
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,680
I just want you to grab a hold of it, tight.

323
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
- Okay?
- I got it.

324
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,960
I mean,
it's not like you really had a chance, okay?

325
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,800
Security guard? Really.

326
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,760
But you're a pen salesman, dude.

327
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,960
Yeah, and I just bought a Camry,
so you can eat me.

328
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,280
All right, bro. Back off.
You know, we're all just here having fun.

329
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,720
Okay, bro.

330
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,840
What?

331
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,200
Hey, thanks
for getting my back there, brother.

332
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,360
Security blood runs deep between...
Yeah, let's just go.

333
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,280
- Round six.
- Let's do this thing.

334
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,600
- Gentlemen ready?
- No.

335
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,280
Not yet. Now I'm ready. Okay.

336
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,960
And, go!

337
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,240
Leon, I can't give you the Heimlich,
so you better chew.

338
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,440
I know.

339
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,520
Told you, boy. You better hurry up.

340
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,000
There you go. Nachos in my face.

341
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,040
Oh, my God. These peppers.
The peppers are hot.

342
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,080
Oh, my God. Oh, that's a hot pepper.

343
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,600
Nachos are good, man.

344
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,320
Better inform all your friends, boy.
Nachos about to be gone.

345
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,400
You're lagging behind.

346
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,880
Come on, Paul. Playing games.

347
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,320
I love these nachos, I'll tell you that much.

348
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,120
- That lemonade is insane.
- Yeah, Paul.

349
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,520
- That's because it's a margarita.
- No. I don't drink.

350
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,640
Twist it.

351
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,120
Feel the nub.

352
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,280
- Hey, you want some? Here.
- Yeah.

353
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,560
You want fruit?

354
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,400
Bye! You blinked! You blinked.

355
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,000
Time to pluck the grape from the vine.

356
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,600
Still got the Baggies! Hot jiggity.

357
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,200
Coming on the left.

358
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,280
False alarm.

359
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,360
Told my mom everything about us.

360
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
What are you talking about?

361
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,480
You're acting coy. Come on. It's natural.

362
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,480
You know. You so know.

363
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,040
No, I'm sorry, Paul. I don't know.

364
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,000
Snap. Pop goes the weasel.

365
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,120
So happy!

366
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,320
Yeah!

367
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,960
Yeah!

368
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,000
I believe in magic!

369
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,960
No way!

370
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,120
I'm sorry it didn't work out, dear.

371
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,680
It's fine, Ma.

372
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,680
- Hey, Dad, why don't we check for matches?
- Yes.

373
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,760
Yeah, I don't think so, sweetheart.
I think I'm just gonna turn in.

374
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,000
Well, how about something special
for lunch tomorrow to cheer you up?

375
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,800
I don't think so, Ma. It's fine.

376
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,360
If something's gonna work,
it would be the sloppy joe.

377
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,400
But that would probably... You know.

378
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,520
You know, if you're doing the sloppy joe,
do the sweet potato fries.

379
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,480
But it... Whatever, you know.
Well done. Yeah.

380
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,720
Maya. Hey.

381
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,920
Dad. I'm so sorry.

382
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,920
It's okay.

383
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,440
There are other fish in the sea.

384
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,960
You just gotta keep looking.

385
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,200
And it doesn't matter what you do.

386
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,080
Because once someone takes the time
to get to know the real you,

387
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,680
all bets are off.

388
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,880
If it doesn't work out, you'll always have us.

389
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,840
I'm sorry, sweetie, I popped my ears.
I didn't hear a word you were saying.

390
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,840
You just have to...

391
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,440
Is that a tattoo?

392
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,520
I... Yeah, yeah, it is.

393
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
When did you get it?

394
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,960
- I got it last night.
- What is it?

395
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,880
It's the Loch Ness monster.

396
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,400
I don't drink.

397
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,600
- Hey.
- Hi.

398
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,120
That was

399
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,160
a little weird the other night, huh?

400
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,760
Yeah, you know, it had its moments. Yeah.

401
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,400
Was one of them
when I tried to make out with your purse?

402
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,040
You see, alcohol instantly turns to sugar
in the blood.

403
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,640
And what happens is the capillaries...

404
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,960
Yeah, look. A lot of people...

405
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,640
Pretty much everybody, you know, tends
to write me off.

406
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,200
And if you did, too, believe me, I get it.

407
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,600
I just...
I guess what I'm asking is that you don't.

408
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,320
Okay. You know, I'm sorry, I've just...

409
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,200
I've gotta cash my paycheck
before the bank closes. I'm...

410
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,600
No problem.
Maybe we could talk later or something?

411
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,360
- Yeah, sure. You could just text me, or...
- Okay.

412
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,840
- Yeah.
- I can do that. I can do that.

413
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,120
You know, Paul, everybody texts these days.

414
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,280
I can't believe you don't have a cell phone.

415
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,320
I'm not about all this technology, Vijay.

416
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,360
I prefer face- to- face interaction
or a nice handwritten sentiment.

417
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,640
300 bucks?

418
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,240
I dug myself into a really deep hole
with this girl, you gotta help me. Please.

419
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,760
Paul, you've always been a straight shooter,
so I'll tell you what.

420
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,520
Why don't you take my daughter
Parisa's phone?

421
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,800
- No, I can't do that.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

422
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,040
I'm punishing her.

423
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,600
No. What with all the parties
and that ex- boyfriend Pahud,

424
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,360
she went over her minutes.

425
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,960
When and if she decides to turn
her life around, I'll simply take it back.

426
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,840
Until then, you use it.

427
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,280
- Thanks.
- Sure.

428
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,720
- Stay within the minutes.
- Of course.

429
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,280
Hey. It's too late to go in that way, guys.
It's closed.

430
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,080
- No one's going in there.
- Yeah. I think we are.

431
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Hey, yo, Paul. Come here, man.

432
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,240
Look, I know you been feeling down,
so I got this for you.

433
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,400
"The Devil's Crotch."

434
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,400
Feel the burn, baby.

435
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,880
- Thanks, Leon.
- Get back at me, man.

436
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,080
- Loading dock's ready.
- Got it.

437
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah.

438
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,920
You need a pen, don't you?

439
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
You know what? No, I'm good.

440
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,800
- I'll just use one of their pens.
- Yeah, you do.

441
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,200
Yes. The Summit 5280 fountain.

442
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,400
- That's stunning.
- Yeah, I know.

443
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,800
How would you like to sign your name
with this panther?

444
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,160
You know what? More than anything.

445
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,960
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Here. Yeah.

446
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,840
It's yours. I insist.

447
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,320
Oh, hey, guys.

448
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
- Hey.
- Hey.

449
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,400
- Hey.
- Don't you just love Fridays?

450
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,040
- Yeah.
- Best night of the week.

451
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,120
Yeah.

452
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,160
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Hey.

453
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,520
Paul. Paul, can you help me out?

454
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,240
I need to shoot over to the bank
for a minute.

455
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,120
There's a few kids inside,
just finishing up their games.

456
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,640
Could you close up the arcade for me?

457
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,760
- Yeah, sure. No problem, Mr. Ferguson.
- Okay.

458
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,200
- You okay? You seem a little down.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

459
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,120
You know, video game might
cheer you right up.

460
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,720
Nah, I'm on duty.

461
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,240
Welcome to the games!

462
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,920
Get set.

463
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,880
Go.

464
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,080
Foul. Foul.

465
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,600
Foul. Foul.

466
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,320
Foul. Foul.

467
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,720
Foul. Foul. Foul. Foul.

468
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,800
Game over.

469
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,920
We are ready.

470
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,960
Let's do this.

471
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,600
Attention shoppers.

472
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,360
Please make your way to the nearest exits.

473
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,520
Unfortunately, the mall will be closing early.

474
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,560
- Everybody out!
- Everybody out!

475
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,800
Everybody out, now!

476
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
You, too!

477
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,320
Hi. Hey! Hey! You got me...

478
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,840
I'm at the West Orange Pavilion Mall.

479
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,240
Hey, yo. Hey, there's some crazy- ass people
trying to take over the mall.

480
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,920
- I'm out of here.
- Everybody on the floor!

481
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,200
Tell them to bring SWAT.
There may be hostages.

482
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,800
What are you doing? Get down.

483
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Oh, my God.

484
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,240
Surprised? I know.

485
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,400
But here's the craziest part.

486
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,520
I'm the leader.

487
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,920
Reports are, they're inside the bank
and they got hostages.

488
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,280
This is Sergeant Howard. I need four units
around the back to secure the perimeter.

489
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,080
See if we can establish visual.
Report back to me immediately.

490
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,440
Let's get all these civilians out of here.

491
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,240
See if we can gain access
into the loading dock.

492
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,000
- Go.
- I'm on it. 94, move 'em out.

493
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,160
Hello?

494
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,520
Feeling alive?

495
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,440
I'm sorry?

496
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,200
Parisa.

497
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,040
She makes you feel alive, doesn't she?

498
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,320
This must be Pahud.
Pahud, no, I'm not with Parisa.

499
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,440
My name's Paul Blart.

500
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,920
Parisa's dad took her cell phone away,
and he lent it to me.

501
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,960
Do not lie to me, Paul Blart.
Do not lie to me.

502
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,880
You are probably
sweating over her right now.

503
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,360
I'm not lying.

504
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,160
I mean, I am sweaty,
but I'm not sweating over anyone.

505
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,680
That woman is like an angelic goddess
who only brings goodness to this world.

506
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,120
Plus, she has some crazy sexy feet.

507
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,080
Paul, the pain of this breakup
is far too much for me to bear, man.

508
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,760
Pahud, no one can blame you
for being upset.

509
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,120
I mean, the holidays are tough enough
without adding heartbreak to the mix.

510
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,640
Wow. Them's some heavy words, Paul Blart.

511
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,600
Hey, life is heavy.

512
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,720
Indeed. Now, you are at the mall, huh?

513
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,960
So why do you not head over
to Orange Julius,

514
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,280
call up my friend Sameer Oh?

515
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,600
Tell him you are now my homeboy.
He will hook you up.

516
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,640
Wait a second.
How'd you know I was at the mall?

517
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,280
I track Parisa's phone with GPS.
Don't you judge me.

518
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,120
Closing time already.

519
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,800
Okay, there are 223 stores in this mall.

520
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,840
Here is a list of the 15 that I need you to hit.

521
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,440
And 15 for you.

522
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,120
Okay.

523
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,160
Now this is the key to retrieve the codes
from each store's credit- card machine.

524
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,160
They change every day, so make sure

525
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,040
that you bring me back the codes
for today, Friday.

526
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,920
Veck, six guys in standard formation,
just like you said.

527
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,960
Perfect.

528
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,720
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

529
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,840
And these little piggies went
all the way home.

530
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,880
Do it.

531
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,200
Gary usually delivers the leftovers
to the Mission.

532
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,960
Hey, everyone. A couple requests.

533
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,400
Kindly tie up the person beside you,
keep your mouths shut,

534
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,240
give up your cell phones,
and as a general rule, do as I say.

535
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,840
You do all these things...
Well, you'll be back at home in no time.

536
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,920
Back to your mediocre lives.

537
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,240
- I don't have one.
- Amy.

538
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,120
I was hoping that you and I could have
a whole Bonnie- and- Clyde thing going on.

539
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,800
You know, minus dying
in a hail of gunfire, of course.

540
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,400
What do you say?

541
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,600
Go to hell.

542
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,400
Ouch.

543
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,200
Hey, Stewie, you don't mind
that I'm hitting on your girlfriend, do you?

544
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,520
What? No. She's not my girlfriend.

545
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,800
But I specifically heard you say
that you two were "basically together."

546
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,960
No. I didn't say that we were together.
I said that she's into leather.

547
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,240
Have at it. If you...

548
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,280
God, you're an idiot.

549
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,600
Hello?

550
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,840
This is Sergeant Howard
of the West Orange Police Department.

551
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,240
- Who am I speaking with?
- Hi.

552
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,040
Yeah, well, so here's the deal.

553
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,200
As you learned the hard way,
I have motion sensors by all the doors,

554
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,560
so if you wanna enter my mall,

555
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,920
you might as well bring
at least six body bags.

556
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,680
He's drilling the safe,
and they have eyes on us.

557
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,560
See if we can tap into the security cameras.

558
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,800
Now look, no one's gonna try
and enter the mall.

559
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,320
Is there anything you need? Do you need
any food? Do you need any water?

560
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,320
Oh, man. This dude
doesn't deviate from the book at all.

561
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,600
You know, since you're asking,
I would love a Happy Meal,

562
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,200
you know, but...
Make sure the toy is the sea monster,

563
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,480
'cause I already have the dragon.

564
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,360
Okay, okay, now what is it you really want?

565
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,760
Silence.

566
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,960
Hey, I'm sorry, mall's closed,

567
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,000
but I can help you find the nearest exit
if you just tell me where you parked.

568
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,840
Sweet mercy.

569
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,040
This is not happening,
this is not happening, this is...

570
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,000
Oh, God. All right, think, Paul, think.

571
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,840
Now what are you trained to do?

572
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,840
Nothing.

573
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,320
Detect, deter, observe, report.
I gotta report it. Reporting it.

574
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,840
Yo, we got a straggler.

575
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,480
- It's a security guard.
- What should we do?

576
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,960
I don't know. Give up, I guess.

577
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,880
Guys, what is wrong with you?
We stick to the plan.

578
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,800
We got a 911 operator connecting us
with some guy named Paul Barth.

579
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,840
He says he's a security officer in the mall.

580
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,160
Hey. Blart? He's one of my guys.

581
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,640
Paul, this is Sergeant Howard
of West Orange Police Department.

582
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,200
The mall has been taken over,
and they have hostages.

583
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,200
I need you to exit the building immediately.

584
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,920
We don't need any wild cards
in this situation.

585
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,560
Copy that. Never been a wild card.

586
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,320
Unless you consider the game of Uno wild.

587
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,560
- Blart! Can we focus here, please?
- Yes. Yes, sir. On my way out.

588
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,920
Okay, okay. Come on, don't die. Don't die.

589
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,480
Blart.

590
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,960
Don't pee. Don't pee.

591
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,680
Guys, motion detector just went off
at Door 26. Everybody on it.

592
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,160
Amy.

593
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,440
What the hell is he doing? Come on!

594
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,640
- Paul, come on!
- Paulie, come on!

595
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,800
- What's he doing?
- Come on, Blart!

596
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,880
Blart, come on!

597
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,680
- Let's go! Move it!
- Come on! Come on!

598
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,240
- Get out of there!
- Come on!

599
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,120
Is he crying?

600
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,200
- I can't leave her.
- Where's he going?

601
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,360
- Blart!
- Where's he going?

602
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,360
Blart, get back! Will you talk to him, please?

603
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,040
Blart, this is Brooks. What's going on?

604
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,320
Sir, I took a sworn oath to protect this mall
and all inside it.

605
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,800
What oath? We don't have an oath.

606
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,880
I sort of made up my own.
It's on a plaque in my room.

607
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,360
Listen, I think you're making a big mistake.

608
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,960
SWAT's on the way.

609
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,040
And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
you're untrained, you're unarmed,

610
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,920
and let's face it, son,
you present a huge target.

611
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,680
With all due respect, sir,
I can't observe and report from the outside.

612
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,720
Over.

613
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,320
Well, Sergeant,
looks like you got your eyes on the inside.

614
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,320
Amy, Paul Blart here.
Are you still in the mall?

615
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,880
Send.

616
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,640
Got him.

617
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,880
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

618
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,800
Think. Think. Think, think, think,
think, think, think, think! Think!

619
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,680
Hold it together.

620
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,320
Heart of a warrior.

621
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,280
I missed lunch.

622
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,240
Thank you.

623
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,800
This isn't happening, this is not happening.

624
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,360
Hey! Don't make this hard.

625
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,840
You like that?

626
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,960
Brooks, I took out a girl,
but the guy, he ran away.

627
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,080
- Wow, Paul, you got one.
- Yes.

628
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,520
But let the record show,
I did not hit a woman. I just...

629
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,440
I put all my weight on her.

630
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,240
Oh, Paul.

631
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,200
No, no, no. She's fine, she's fine.

632
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,240
Well, good, let's get you out of there.

633
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,960
No can do, sir.
I am gonna finish what I started.

634
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,600
What the heck is this?

635
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,040
Give me that.

636
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,400
Paul, this is Sergeant Howard again.

637
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,240
Since you refuse to come out,
I'm gonna need you to go into the bank

638
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,080
and find out
where they're holding the hostages.

639
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,240
With honor, sir.

640
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,200
Good to know.

641
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,280
Hey, I haven't heard back
from Donner or Vixen.

642
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,200
Okay. I'm calling an audible here, everyone.

643
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,600
And I need to get this mall locked down
from the inside immediately.

644
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,200
Why don't we just start wasting hostages?
That'll stop them.

645
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,480
Well, that's one way to go, but our hostages
are the only thing keeping the cops outside.

646
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,400
I'm Commander Kent. My team is deploying.
I need this location secured.

647
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,000
- We got a three- block perimeter...
- Establish a perimeter

648
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,040
and get all these people out of here.

649
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,320
Whoa, whoa, this is all done already.

650
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,320
My men are gonna do it again, the right way.

651
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,680
Have your guys fall back, now.
Have there been any demands?

652
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,200
- A Happy Meal and absolute silence.
- Well, let's make some noise.

653
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,480
I got snipers at the ready,
communications in check.

654
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,400
Let's tap into security now,
and let's get some visuals.

655
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,840
You can't.
They knocked out the video cameras.

656
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:14,680
I'll be ready to take on- scene command
in three, two, one. I'm in charge.

657
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,040
Brooks, I'm observing the bank now.

658
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,040
They got one assailant
guarding the hostages.

659
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,840
There she is.

660
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,040
My, God. You are my angel pie.

661
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,960
Here come the love sweats.

662
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,840
Paul, your radio's still on.

663
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,200
Roger that.

664
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,400
- What's going on? Who is that?
- We got a guy on the inside.

665
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,760
Don't tell me one of your beat cops
is trying to be a hero.

666
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,120
No, he's neither. His name is Blart.
He's one of my security guards.

667
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,400
- Wait a minute. Blart?
- Yeah.

668
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,760
- Paul Blart?
- Yeah.

669
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,480
Are you kidding me? We used to abuse
that loser in high school. Give me that.

670
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,200
Blart.

671
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,400
This is Commander James Kent.
New Jersey SWAT.

672
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,480
We went to high school together.
Remember?

673
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,280
I set you on fire at the pancake festival?

674
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,760
Oh, yeah. Hey, Jimmy.

675
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,440
Go Green Hawks.

676
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,080
Yeah, listen. I've got 50 highly trained,
armed professionals out here.

677
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,160
At my command,
we are retaking this location,

678
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,200
and there's no way I'm compromising
this mission so that some mall monitor

679
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,360
who used to eat lunch
with his imaginary friend can screw it up.

680
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,760
Sorry, Jimmy, I had the button pressed.
All I heard was "lunch" and "friend."

681
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,000
Could you do me a favor
and put Chief Brooks back on?

682
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,160
Listen to me, Blart,

683
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,080
you are no longer communicating
with Chief Brooks. Is that clear?

684
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,200
Hello?

685
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,280
Hello?

686
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,320
Yeah? Oh, hey, Paul, how you doing?

687
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,400
Well, it looks like they moved the hostages
into the teller area.

688
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,760
I'm gonna get a closer look.

689
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,680
Veck.

690
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,520
There he is!

691
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,680
- Everyone in the back room, now!
- Come on, move, move!

692
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,840
Let's get in the back, huh?

693
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,480
Brooks. I lost visual on the hostages.
I couldn't get them out.

694
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,520
But I know who the leader is. It's Veck.

695
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,800
Veck? The trainee?

696
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,160
- No. The brainee.
- I don't believe this.

697
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,080
I'll pass it on to Howard.

698
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,720
Oh, God.

699
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,640
Trapped is fine by me.

700
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,320
Commence tanning. Three, two, one.

701
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,280
Yeah!

702
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,760
Yes!

703
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,280
Time for some big- game hunting.

704
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,400
Open, open, open! Thank God.

705
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,520
Oh, no.

706
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,520
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! We get it!

707
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,160
Get him! Get him! Get him!

708
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,080
You better run.

709
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,120
- Rudolph, where are you?
- I'm about to end this.

710
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,400
Amy, huh? What a coincidence.

711
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,080
We got a cute little redhead
down at the bank named Amy.

712
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,440
- Strawberry blonde, actually.
- Yeah?

713
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,080
Well, I guess I know who I'm killing first.

714
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,640
- Catch you later!
- Yeah?

715
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,880
Well, it looks like you just ran out of mall.

716
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,800
It'll be over quick. She won't feel a thing.

717
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,600
You aren't gonna touch her,
but you are gonna feel this.

718
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,360
Nobody wins with a head butt.

719
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,320
- Give me your cell phone.
- I don't have one.

720
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,440
What are you talking about?
Every kid has a cell phone.

721
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,760
I prefer handwritten sentiments.

722
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,480
Who are these sloppy joes for?
And who gave you this?

723
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,680
They're mine.
I'm late for my shift at Foot Locker.

724
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,600
We're getting the leader on the horn.
He wants to talk to you.

725
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,200
Silence, my ass.

726
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,120
What's the matter?
Throw a few jabs your way,

727
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,880
you curl up in a corner, suck your thumb?

728
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,440
If you don't go toe- to- toe
with that scumbag,

729
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,640
he's gonna roll over on you all night long.

730
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,720
It's all right. That's not my style.

731
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,720
Well, just in case, I wrote down
a couple of clever comebacks, like...

732
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,840
Here.

733
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,120
This is what you been doing?

734
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,880
"Yeah, you and what army?"

735
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,200
- What's wrong with that?
- He has an army.

736
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,720
Everyone deserves a card on their birthday.

737
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,400
So when you and Rudolph
were laughing it up back at the crib

738
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,840
about how easy all this was gonna be,
were you guys like,

739
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,120
"Man, any brain- dead mall cop
that gets in the way is gonna get smoked"?

740
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,760
And then... And then what?
You guys all high- fived?

741
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,160
- Veck, this guard is...
- Winning! I know this, because I am all set!

742
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,400
But sadly, no codes!

743
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,680
And I'd say, considering
all the luxury items that I have stacked up

744
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:22,160
in my Amazon shopping cart,
situation unacceptable!

745
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,160
No, no, no, no, no, no. He looking.

746
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,280
Give me a gun.

747
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,360
Put it down. Put it down.

748
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,520
What are you nodding about?

749
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,240
I was just wondering,
were you serious about that Happy Meal?

750
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,520
It isn't coming, is it?

751
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,960
What?

752
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,160
This is Commander James Kent,
New Jersey SWAT.

753
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,440
You wanted to speak to me?

754
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,440
I just wanna make sure
that no one does anything stupid.

755
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,440
You should know my men are deployed
and ready to bring this thing to a resolution.

756
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,640
The easy way or the hard way.

757
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,720
That is such a tough call, but...

758
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,240
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and go with C,
none of the above!

759
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,040
I'm Amy, by the way.

760
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,400
- Amy? From unbeWEAVEable?
- Yeah.

761
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,920
I'm Maya.
My father talked forever about you.

762
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,360
And I gotta say, he really does like you.

763
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,080
I'm gonna throw up.

764
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,600
Oh, that's not so bad.

765
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,800
Oh, my God.

766
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,280
They've got his daughter.

767
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,960
- Dad?
- Maya.

768
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,280
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- How's your blood sugar?

769
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,320
Don't worry about me, okay?
I'm worried about you.

770
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,360
I love you.
All right, now, I'm gonna get you all out.

771
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,080
You just hang in there, okay, sweetie?

772
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,840
I will. I'm a Blart, remember?

773
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,800
Yeah. I'll see you soon.

774
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,800
I'm supposed to be on my way
to the Cayman lslands with the hostages.

775
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,240
And where the hell is Rudolph?
He should be back by now.

776
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,520
"lf Veck gets the codes,
he's taking us to Cayman lslands"?

777
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,600
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.

778
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,800
Come and get me, Veck.

779
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,960
I got your codes
for the credit- card machines.

780
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,760
- Yo, you hear that? That's Paul, baby!
- Blart?

781
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,080
That's who's been screwing all this up?
You have got to be kidding me.

782
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,520
Give me a radio.

783
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,200
Let me tell you something.

784
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,720
You take hostages in my mall,
you are making a big mistake.

785
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,720
You seriously undermissed...

786
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,800
And you seriously...

787
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,160
Oh, no!

788
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,280
Blart?

789
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,800
Sugar. Sugar.

790
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,440
Blart? You there, Blart?

791
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,360
Hello, Blart. You there?

792
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,840
Hey, Blart!

793
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,560
I was hoping we could get an ETA
of when you're gonna give up.

794
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,840
How about now?

795
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,280
I'll meet you on the corner of Ne and Ver.

796
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,040
Yeah, you heard me. Never!

797
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,560
All right, Dad.

798
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,960
Hey, fellas! You looking for me?

799
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,080
Come on. Come on, come on. Come on.

800
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,080
Follow me.

801
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,520
There he is.

802
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,720
We got him trapped in Rainforest Cafe.

803
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,680
Great. Wait for me.
You know, my mom always said,

804
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,920
"lf you want something done right,
waste the guy yourself."

805
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,760
I'm paraphrasing, of course. You stay here.

806
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,560
Prancer, take the back.

807
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,760
Hey, you. Scuba Dooby- Doo.

808
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,520
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can I have my codes now, please?

809
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,760
Why? No codes, no Cayman lslands?

810
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,680
Looks like Paul Blart turned into
quite the badass.

811
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.

812
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,440
No.

813
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,120
One thing I know is
Paul Blart is not a badass.

814
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,640
Comet! Don't come back till he's dead!

815
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:51,080
Brooks. Only one more left.
Then it's just me and Veck.

816
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,800
Okay, who's talking to Blart?

817
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,760
Was it you, sugar mouth?

818
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,320
All right. Let's try this again.

819
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,920
Wait! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

820
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,440
It's her phone, it's hers.
She's talking to him.

821
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,440
She's talking to him, and I told her not to.
And it's under her leg.

822
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,600
The phone. Her right leg. Right there.
That's good.

823
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,800
Okay.

824
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,720
That was close.

825
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,520
He is a pro.

826
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,200
Listen, Blart, time's up. We're busting in.

827
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,000
Wait! Look, Veck's after
the credit- card codes, and I got them.

828
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,600
Just give me a few minutes.

829
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,680
No problem.

830
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,480
Isn't that cute?

831
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,040
- Hey, Amy. I'm on my way.
- Oh, hey, Blart.

832
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,760
Wow. Our boy Stuart just turned me on
to your profile

833
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,720
on lonelyloser.com.

834
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,120
"Likes morning rain, walks on the beach."

835
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,640
Who are you, Olivia Newton- John?

836
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,360
I was just speaking from the heart.

837
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,840
Yeah, well, I didn't have to go online, Paul,
to know that you love peanut brittle.

838
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,960
You're so pathetic.

839
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,520
Trippy.

840
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,920
This I can use.

841
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,560
What do you want, Veck?

842
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,840
I just want the $30 million
that I came here for.

843
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:58,440
But, you know, I would settle offing
your dream girl, or maybe your daughter.

844
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,760
You touch them, I swear I'll end you.

845
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,240
What're you gonna do, Paul?

846
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,560
You gonna pull up with your left hip forward
giving the illusion that you have a gun,

847
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,840
which you and I both know you don't?

848
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,160
- I could.
- You're not gonna do squat.

849
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,360
The next time I see you, Paul,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

850
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,880
I don't think so. I'm taking you down.

851
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,520
Blart!

852
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,040
Oh, Blart.

853
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,760
Sweet mercy.

854
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,600
I wish I had a bat. I would bust you open,
see how much candy fell out.

855
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,440
- Too tight!
- This is not happening.

856
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,600
- It's not happening.
- Come on.

857
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,720
Bravo. That was awesome.

858
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,600
And you were just so close
to making it, too, Paul. Just so close.

859
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,560
- It's not over yet.
- Yeah, I think it is.

860
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,640
Now the only thing I need are my codes,
which, judging from your text messages,

861
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,720
you have been so sweet as to enter them
into your phone just for me.

862
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,840
You think I'm gonna carry the phone
with me that actually contains the...

863
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,000
- Yello?
- Peanut Blart and Jelly.

864
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:16,360
What's up, man?
So good to hear your voice.

865
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,640
Yeah, it's good to hear
your voice, too, Pahud.

866
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,200
Listen, I'm gonna have to call you back.

867
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,960
- What? When?
- I don't know when. I'll talk to you later.

868
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,840
Okay, Paul, call me back!
Call me back, Paul!

869
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,680
I mean,
this just keeps getting better and better.

870
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,600
I mean, you are impossible
to underestimate.

871
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,440
I mean, you can't pass the trooper exam,

872
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,360
you black out if you don't have
a Snickers bar like every 20 minutes,

873
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,960
you had the chance to be the MVP,
and you blew it.

874
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,120
Again, like you always do.
Ain't that right, Maya?

875
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,480
What do you want me to say, Veck?
You're smarter than me.

876
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:02,200
You're good on computers,
you kept your weight under control.

877
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,840
I mean, people,
they look at me and you, and...

878
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,720
Yeah, it's a landslide.

879
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,640
It's no contest.

880
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,480
Sorry.

881
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,960
Right now, you're the man with the gun.

882
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,600
So here you go.

883
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,080
Come on!

884
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,560
Go get him!

885
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,840
Go, Dad.

886
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:43,840
What...

887
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,520
Probably should have capitalized on that.

888
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,320
Dad!

889
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,120
Lock and load, boys. We're going in.

890
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,200
Hey, we're on the move.

891
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,480
Let's go.

892
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,680
Come on, come on, come on.

893
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,960
Paul. Think, Paul. Think!

894
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:38,560
Let's go, men. Take it down.
Secure the suspects.

895
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,400
Get down!

896
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,600
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

897
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,040
Down. The other one. That's the back one.

898
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,400
No, no. That's the same one. No!
The other one!

899
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,040
Veck got away with my daughter and Amy.

900
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,800
Entry team, clear the mall. We'll pursue.

901
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,400
Light.

902
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,320
Open the door.

903
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,440
Let's do this.

904
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,320
Jimmy, give me your cell phone.

905
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:31,040
Gotta hand it to you, Blart.
You're really taking care of business.

906
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,000
What up?

907
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,640
Pahud, do you still have GPS
on Parisa's cell phone?

908
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:40,840
You know I do, Paul. You know I do.
What can I do for you?

909
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,560
I need to know where it's headed.

910
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,520
Paul, it looks like
they're on their way to McGuire Airfield.

911
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,680
I know where that is. Thanks.

912
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,000
Hang on.

913
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,960
My God. There they are.
Jimmy, take the wheel.

914
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,080
What?

915
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,600
Here we go! Here we go!

916
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,840
That was me. I can't...

917
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,800
Here I go! No!

918
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,360
Blart!

919
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,400
Don't do it! Blart!

920
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,760
Oh, God. Oh, God.

921
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,720
Maya! Maya, get inside.

922
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,640
- Oh, God!
- Dad!

923
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,760
Paul?

924
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,080
I really don't drink.

925
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,840
Come on. Oh, yeah?

926
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,280
- Dad!
- Come on.

927
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,640
Dad!

928
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,680
Man, that hypoglycemia is a killer.

929
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,520
I told you I'd take you down.

930
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,800
Blart!

931
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,120
Very impressive,
taking down an assailant without a gun.

932
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,600
I hope you don't mind if I use one.

933
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:06,920
What?

934
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,000
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

935
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,720
I guess
it's off to the Cayman lslands then, huh?

936
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,200
Soon as I get my money.

937
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:20,800
Yeah, well, you'll be needing this.

938
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,760
Just give it to him, Dad.

939
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,880
Oh, I will. Suck on that!

940
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,000
Okay. Situation update?

941
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,720
We have seven assailants in custody, sir.

942
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:38,240
- Great. Nobody talks to them but me.
- Yes, sir.

943
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,480
You see, jackass? I don't need the phone.

944
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,520
'Cause I got all the access codes
written on their arm.

945
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,640
Now, I kill you three,
there'll be no witnesses.

946
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,200
And since everybody thinks
this was a bank...

947
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:05,400
I got a newsflash for you.
Your flight's been canceled.

948
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,680
That's better than anything I got.

949
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,680
You did good, Dad.

950
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,960
Yeah, I am pretty great.

951
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,360
You know, she doesn't need a green card.

952
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,920
I don't know what to say.

953
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,920
I have something I want to say to you.

954
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,080
Happy birthday, Amy.

955
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,160
I heard you applied to be a state trooper.

956
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:46,760
You say the word,
my department would be proud to have you.

957
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,080
Thank you, sir. But I think
I'm gonna stick with what I do best.

958
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,320
It's protecting the people
of the West Orange Pavilion Mall.
