1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:38,778
<i>My niece is a basket case,
but she's a good kid.</i>

2
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,161
<i>She wants to be an actress.</i>

3
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:42,866
<i>Hmm..</i>

4
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,123
<i>Savannah, Georgia.</i>

5
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,786
<i>Flying won't work.</i>

6
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,121
<i>There's a pet,</i>

7
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,871
<i>and I have a crate full
of stuff at my house.</i>

8
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,758
<i>Miami to L.A.</i>

9
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:58,256
<i>Get an intern, they've
gotta be good for something.</i>

10
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:03,391
<i>No, we need someone
boring, predictable,</i>

11
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:06,941
<i>a real kiss-ass
kind of guy.</i>

12
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,351
Hello, Mr. Ragstan, beautiful
tie. Latte and...

13
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,730
Can you check yourselves
off please?

14
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Hi. How are you doing?

15
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:43,073
That's it.

16
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:49,283
"Whereas conduct is
expressly declared by law
to establish his complicity."

17
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,419
Keep reading,
please.

18
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,880
Hey! I need 50 copies of
these by tomorrow morning.

19
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:01,587
Thanks, Mr.Thompson, I can stay
late and get this done for you.

20
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:05,252
I like that tie, I do.
You want it collated?

21
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:09,761
All this work for what, Rick?
So that you can
end up like that guy?

22
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:12,639
No Carl. So I can end
up like that guy,

23
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:16,231
and be a
partner some day.

24
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,770
Just gotta get my
foot in the door first.

25
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,480
Maxwell McAllister, huh?

26
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,524
That's someone you want to
pattern your life after?

27
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:25,569
Eighty hours a week and an ulcer
the size of a grapefruit.

28
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,530
Well, see you in
the bar book, buddy.

29
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,829
As for me,

30
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:33,790
<i>I'm out of here.
Thundercats is on.</i>

31
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,412
It's only 4:20.

32
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:37,422
Exactly.

33
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,713
Don't you think it's
about time to move on?

34
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:05,418
Just make a
serious effort?

35
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:07,878
Look, I'm losing you.
I'm in the elevator.

36
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:09,888
Bye.

37
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:22,526
Thanks.

38
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:26,824
I just love
working here, sir.

39
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:30,911
Great firm, sir.

40
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:37,074
Yeah.

41
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:41,250
And if-if there's
anything I can ever do,

42
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,623
anything you need,
I'm talking anything, I mean--

43
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:47,631
I'm moving a few
things tomorrow,

44
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:50,759
I could use
an extra hand.

45
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:54,299
Yeah, I can move. I just--
I take stuff, and I put it--

46
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:57,594
I'm wondering if I should
tell you about my niece.

47
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:00,436
She's very beautiful.

48
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:04,351
Means the world to me.
I put her through college.

49
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:06,103
I don't think
I know her.

50
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:08,277
She's a bit of a talker.

51
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:12,532
And between you and me,
she's also a little...wild.

52
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:14,486
You know what I mean?

53
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,321
Yeah.

54
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,031
I mean, no, no.

55
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:22,995
If you touch her,
I will break every
little bone in your body.

56
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:25,502
8:00 am sharp,
my house.

57
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:28,458
Keep the
handkerchief.

58
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:30,799
See you
tomorrow.

59
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:33,760
Oh. Oh, can
I get my shoe back?

60
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,834
"A truck is waiting at
Paradise rentals.

61
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:14,712
"Pick up my niece
in Georgia and take her
to this address in L.A.

62
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:16,256
I expect change."

63
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:19,217
Inhale, step your foot
back to plank pose.

64
00:07:19,227 --> 00:07:21,724
Exhale, chadaranga.

65
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:25,223
Inhale, pull forward and up.
Open the heart center.

66
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,564
Exhale, hips to the sky.

67
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:29,569
Five deep breaths.

68
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:44,909
What is it?
I'm working out.

69
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,953
Carl, I need a number
for McAllister.

70
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:49,205
I've never even
seen the man.

71
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:51,582
Cell phones are not
allowed in class.

72
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:54,715
My wife just had
a miscarriage.

73
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,753
I'm so sorry.

74
00:07:55,763 --> 00:07:58,386
Yeah, you should be.

75
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:00,476
Go do your thing.

76
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:05,471
Carl, he wants me
to move his niece to
his house in Los Angeles.

77
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,098
I'm supposed to
pick her up in Savannah.

78
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,725
This is going to ruin
our entire study plan.

79
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:13,854
Ooh, Savannah.
Georgia. That means
that she's a Southerner.

80
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:15,856
Does she have
a nice little accent?

81
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:19,986
Look, the Bar's in four days.
I don't think I can make it.
I gotta talk to McAllister.

82
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:22,571
Rick, this is what
you've been dreaming about.

83
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:23,948
<i>No, it's not.</i>

84
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,617
You bet it is. It's your
chance to prove to McAllister

85
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:28,285
that you've got what it takes
to be a part of his team.

86
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:31,163
<i>You really think so?
Yeah, I'm sure of it.</i>

87
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:34,421
Rick, you're taxing me.

88
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,668
Now are you going to
get with the niece?

89
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:38,384
Look, he said he--

90
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,172
He said, and I quote,

91
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:43,050
"If you touch her, I will
break every bone in your body."

92
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,220
<i>He wrote that down.
Oh...forbidden love.</i>

93
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,097
This is so hot.

94
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:50,099
<i>I got an exam to
study for, Carl.</i>

95
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:51,308
<i>Will you please
focus?</i>

96
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:54,066
Rick, I ask you
this as a friend,

97
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,145
will you take
pictures?

98
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:57,314
We're going to drive
straight through.

99
00:08:57,324 --> 00:08:59,733
That's like three days.
It's plenty of time.

100
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:00,818
We're not
stopping.

101
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:01,985
You're with a girl.

102
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:03,445
Well,
we're not.
Yeah huh.

103
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:04,696
Nah-uh.
Yeah huh.

104
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:08,191
We're not.
When did you become
such a wuss?

105
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:17,918
An additional 35 cents per mile
on top of the rental fee.

106
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:20,963
Whaddya think, we're
giving things away here?

107
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:22,973
Next!

108
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:32,854
Hi, Margery.
That's a pretty name.

109
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,024
I have a reservation
for McAllister.

110
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,813
Maxwell McAllister?
Yeah.

111
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:39,948
I need a destination zip.

112
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,195
90212.

113
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:48,411
Miami to Los Angeles.
Superb.

114
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,331
That will be $35.95 a day,

115
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,371
I'll give you five days
to get there.

116
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:56,248
- Three.
- What?

117
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:59,673
Three days. I'll be
there in three days.

118
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:05,100
2,438 at 90 cents a mile,
that'll be 2,235.

119
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,051
See, he gave me 300 bucks.

120
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:09,928
You want the truck
for McAllister?

121
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:11,938
It's the last one left.

122
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:18,061
Can you put the
difference on the card?

123
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:21,216
I can put the whole
thing on the card.

124
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:24,609
Good, because that's
what I really want.

125
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:28,780
Passenger door sticks,
gauge is broken, you'll have
to fill it up every 100 miles.

126
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,785
I was wondering if
you guys had any...
We're out.

127
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,519
Hello?

128
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:49,743
Hello?

129
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:51,779
Michelle?

130
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:53,994
Is everyone decent?

131
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,096
Hey, you must be Rick.

132
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,348
Yeah.

133
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:21,642
I'm Michelle, these are
my roommates.

134
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:23,435
Roommates, I'd like
you to meet Rick.
Hi, Rick.

135
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:25,896
We're having a little
farewell party.

136
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:29,051
Nice, but we really
have to get going.

137
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:36,870
Here. I made
you something.

138
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,997
Thanks.
What is it?

139
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,952
Drink it.
It will relax you.

140
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:44,362
It's made from
angel's tears.

141
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,174
It's delicious.

142
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,879
Rick, have a seat.

143
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:54,304
Okay, but we really
gotta be going soon.

144
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:56,309
Okay.

145
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:00,555
I'm going to fall
out of this chair.

146
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:01,932
Wait, is my wing on fire?

147
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:19,884
As manager of McAllister,

148
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:22,558
Morganstern and Raphael,

149
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:25,765
I'm looking for two things
in a young lawyer:

150
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:28,064
his swing,

151
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:30,069
and his endgame.

152
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,699
Another hole-in-one.
You should be my partner.

153
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,993
I don't know if
you can afford me.

154
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:48,209
You know?

155
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,429
Your mom says go home.

156
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:07,186
Hey.

157
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:09,475
Is that it?
Yeah.

158
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:11,685
Please tell me
we're not taking that.

159
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:13,312
What? This?

160
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:16,695
Aww, this is Dorothy.
Oh, hi, baby girl.

161
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:19,156
Say hi!

162
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,413
Hi. Oh, I love you.

163
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:30,454
We're going to have
to drive all night.

164
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:31,997
You're mad, aren't you?

165
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:35,584
Look, I'm not exactly sure
what happened last night,

166
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:38,211
but I have to be back
in Miami in 92 hours

167
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:39,671
to take the Bar Exam.

168
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:42,387
My career-- my entire life

169
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:43,842
hangs in the balance.

170
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:48,560
We are driving
2514.5 miles.

171
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,599
Now, at an average
of 50 miles per hour,

172
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,435
that's 50 hours and 14
minutes driving time.

173
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:56,730
We have contingency hours
scheduled, for gas and
emergencies,

174
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,398
but thanks to you
and your friends,

175
00:15:58,408 --> 00:15:59,524
some of those are gone now.

176
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,865
How about laughing, huh?

177
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,570
Do we have any time
scheduled for laughing?

178
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,065
I just wanna know just
so I don't miss it.

179
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:10,624
Where are you from?

180
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,537
Wichita, Kansas.

181
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:13,830
Does your family still
live there?

182
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,415
Yeah.

183
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:18,251
We should stop by and say hi.
It's totally on the way.

184
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:22,088
It's not even remotely
on the way, so let's just
concentrate on the trip.

185
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,215
I can see why
my uncle picked you.

186
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:25,216
Really?

187
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:26,217
Mmm-hmm.

188
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:28,522
You make a great
babysitter.

189
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,899
I'll drive the next shift.

190
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:42,734
You're not on the insurance.

191
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:45,069
I'm driving straight through.
Not possible.

192
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:47,947
And no drinks.
I'm not stopping
for you to go again.

193
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:50,617
So he gives me this look in
the eye like he's gonna race me.

194
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,577
Like he's gonna take me
in my Camaro.

195
00:16:52,587 --> 00:16:54,621
He's got a Sunfire.
What's that gonna do to me?

196
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:56,039
You know what I'm saying?

197
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:00,084
So I told him I...I said...
I said..

198
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:02,094
Oh man.

199
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:05,181
You see her?

200
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:13,473
Gas and whatever she's got.

201
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,308
Well, what she got?

202
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:16,851
I dunno.

203
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,275
Well, y'all
wanna buy a mug?

204
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,313
No.
Are you sure?

205
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:22,023
You can hold a
lot more than Coke in this.

206
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:23,816
You can hold crawdads, whatever
you want.
Yes, I'm sure.

207
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:26,485
They're real good mugs y'know,
and you buy one of these you get

208
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:30,411
free refills on every
Tuesday and Friday.

209
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:34,535
Heck, before you say no,
I wanna let you know
I've had my mug for five years.

210
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:36,589
So durable.

211
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:40,708
You made me wreck
my mug.

212
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:43,507
We want the mug.

213
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,796
You want a mug?
I want the mug.

214
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:48,674
Oh great. Well,
you're real nice, lady.

215
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:51,302
Watcha doin' hanging out
with this Clark Kent,

216
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:54,346
when you could be
with a real Superman?

217
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:55,347
Just kidding you, boy!

218
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:58,856
My God, you see
his eyes? Dang.

219
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,394
Could I have my mug?

220
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:04,320
Oh yeah, hold on.
You want your change?
Nah.

221
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,733
For the kids.

222
00:18:05,743 --> 00:18:06,734
For the kids.

223
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:07,901
Here you go, sweetheart.

224
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:09,778
Fill 'er up.
Thank you, my love.

225
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,119
You owe me for my mug.

226
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,124
That's $3.99.

227
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:22,236
And I'm giving this
change to the kids.

228
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:38,312
Oh, Dorothy!

229
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:40,317
Nice try, Michelle.

230
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,817
So why Los Angeles?
Why you going there?

231
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,827
I'm an actor.

232
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:55,370
Doesn't L.A. have
enough waitresses?

233
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,077
No, they called while
you were asleep and said
they needed one more.

234
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:03,167
Oh, oh wait, doesn't Miami
have enough copy boys?

235
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,506
I have to pee.

236
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:10,755
Okay, well, we got a stop
planned in about two hours.

237
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:13,008
Uh-uh. I can't wait that long.
I have to pee now.

238
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,348
Do the kegel thing.

239
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:18,268
What? I am poisoning myself.

240
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:19,764
Right now.
This is very--

241
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:21,774
You know, forget it.

242
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:26,146
What are you doing?
I gotta pee.

243
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:29,471
No, no, no, no! Uh-uh.

244
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:44,269
Time's up. Let's go!

245
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,221
Okay. Ugh. Ugh!

246
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:53,798
Is that it?

247
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,717
Yeah, I peed.

248
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,229
Close the door.
Oh.

249
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:09,981
Come on, come on. No!

250
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,447
Hi, Margery, it's Rick.

251
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:14,277
The truck broke.

252
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:16,367
I think it's the engine.

253
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:19,579
I'm not really a car guy.

254
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,253
Call back if you get this.

255
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:37,725
I'm going this way.

256
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,265
I'll bet someone comes
in like five minutes.

257
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,516
I doubt it.

258
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,518
You're not going
to be here.

259
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:52,798
Then you'll have to
tell my uncle you left
me behind, won't you?

260
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,318
This is ridiculous.

261
00:20:56,328 --> 00:20:58,654
These are the kind of
woods men are raped in.

262
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:03,075
You okay?

263
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:04,660
Hello?

264
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,495
Yeah.
Wait, is that the car lady?

265
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,330
It's Carl.
Who's Carl?

266
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,379
He's my fat friend.

267
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:13,794
<i>Hey buddy, I was just wondering
if you wanted to come over
and watch  Family Ties.</i>

268
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:16,380
Carl, I'm in the
middle of the forest.

269
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,382
When are you
going to be done?

270
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:20,175
I'm moving McAllister's
niece, remember?

271
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:21,927
L.A.?

272
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:23,971
<i>What? I thought I told
you not to do that.</i>

273
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,180
You talked me into it.

274
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,349
No, no, buddy, I wouldn't
have told you that.

275
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,435
You said it was
a good career move.

276
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:32,771
Now come on over here
and have a grilled cheese.

277
00:21:32,781 --> 00:21:34,565
I'm in a different state.

278
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:35,983
<i>Carl, help!</i>

279
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:37,526
Is that her?

280
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:38,735
Yeah.
Yeah, what?

281
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:40,153
Is she hot?

282
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:41,864
I gotta go.

283
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:44,408
Okay, Rick, if she's hot,
say you're tired.

284
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:46,243
If she's not, say
it's hot outside.

285
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:47,828
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you talking about me?

286
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:50,956
<i>Wait, no no. If she's hot,
say it's hot outside.</i>

287
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:52,708
If she's not...
I'm hanging up.

288
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,501
Did you give it to her?

289
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:56,003
What did he say?

290
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:58,013
He said hi.

291
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:00,971
Oh, this is so spooky.

292
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:03,677
Do you have to go
all the way to L.A.?

293
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:05,178
Can't I drop you
somewhere closer?

294
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:07,188
Like here?

295
00:22:14,072 --> 00:22:17,404
Oh, look, civilization.

296
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:20,615
Maybe we should
go back and hitch.

297
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,362
Shouldn't we try
to get it fixed first?

298
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:24,739
What makes you think these
people can fix anything?

299
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:27,742
Well, if they can't, then
we'll go back and hitch.

300
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:29,244
Here.

301
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:30,996
What if we end up
buried in the forest?

302
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:33,581
Oh, what are
the chances of that?

303
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:35,417
Don't move or
I'll kill you!

304
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:39,467
You like that?

305
00:22:39,477 --> 00:22:42,720
Huh? Huh?

306
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,760
Tomek! You put down
that knife right now!

307
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,770
Here, take the baby.

308
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:51,391
I said, put down the knife.

309
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:54,978
I was only kidding.
I'm only gonna kid you-- git!

310
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:56,988
Git!

311
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,653
It's alright, baby.
You're just in time for dinner.

312
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:07,233
Nice pig. Come on.
Come on, bring the baby.

313
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:10,410
Watch out for my laundry.
It's getting dry.

314
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,997
We got us an antenna
over there.

315
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:16,874
Picks up all kinds of shows.

316
00:23:16,884 --> 00:23:19,794
<i>You know that I missed
Days of Our Lives
for a year-and-a-half?</i>

317
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:22,046
Marlena was a-killin'
everybody.

318
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:23,714
But then I found out
it was all make-believe.

319
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:26,175
I can't tell you
how relieved I was.

320
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:28,010
I feel like
we're imposing.

321
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,096
Don't be ridiculous.
Tomek can get your truck all
fixed up nice and new

322
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:32,390
right after you've had
a real good meal.

323
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,101
Oh, he's sorry. He was just
saying how hungry he was.

324
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:37,441
Yes, you were.

325
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:39,569
Have some.

326
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:43,399
Oh, he likes you.
Eat on up, clean your plate.

327
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:47,118
So, um, does
your jacuzzi work?

328
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:51,367
Of course it does,
honey. Why would we
have a busted jacuz?

329
00:23:51,377 --> 00:23:56,732
There ain't nothing
like a good long soak
after a good long meal.

330
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,757
Y'all got your suits?

331
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:05,077
Oh, I don't need mine.
I don't have one.

332
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:14,481
I wear my skin suit.

333
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:18,227
Lord, I better
go lock up the kids.

334
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:20,237
Kids! Get on
over here!

335
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:24,900
We keep the tub real natural,
none of that chlorine stuff.

336
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,866
Kills the skin, y'know.

337
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:30,369
You kids shut up
in there!

338
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:35,040
This is alone time.

339
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,045
There is nothing on.

340
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:40,624
Mikey, be careful
with that thing.

341
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:43,961
We are not changing the water
if you cut yourself again.

342
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:46,718
I'm about
this close, woman.

343
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,549
Mikey, look!

344
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,348
<i>Lifetimes of
the Rich and Famous.</i>

345
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,011
Look at that!

346
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:56,353
There is a pool
inside the house.

347
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:59,267
Honey, we are getting
one of those when
our ship comes in.

348
00:24:59,277 --> 00:25:03,442
Them kids are awful quiet.

349
00:25:03,824 --> 00:25:06,289
Rick, where are your clothes?

350
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:12,864
It's your turn
to check on 'em.

351
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:15,293
Tomek!
Hey, pop.

352
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:18,041
It's warm.

353
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:20,752
I fixed your truck.

354
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:21,832
Are you okay?

355
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:25,718
You look like dook.

356
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:39,599
They were really nice.

357
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:43,191
Nice nothing, they
burned my clothes.

358
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,196
They have good taste.

359
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:50,615
Hey, you know,
I could drive.

360
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,529
Nope.

361
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:55,198
Well, then why don't you
just, like, pull over
and take a break?

362
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,914
'Cause we don't
have time.

363
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:00,124
What's this?

364
00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:02,126
It's an energy drink.

365
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:04,379
Yeah?

366
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:06,756
What's in it?

367
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:10,885
Fruits, vegetables,
vitamins.

368
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:12,887
Yeah?

369
00:26:12,897 --> 00:26:15,890
Antioxidants,
various colors.

370
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,470
Have some.

371
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,852
Maybe later.

372
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:21,557
Maybe now?

373
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,434
Maybe you should
stop bothering me.

374
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:25,603
Maybe you should
just drink some.

375
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:27,615
Here.

376
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:32,620
Mmm, tasty.

377
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:08,734
Rick! What is
wrong with you?

378
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:09,730
Rick!

379
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,780
You gotta come see this!

380
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,497
Rick?
Rick?

381
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,832
Somebody help.

382
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,837
Help!

383
00:27:27,925 --> 00:27:31,794
I'm going to break every
little bone in your body.

384
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:33,170
He's not breathing.

385
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,595
The ruffles are
repressing his chakra.

386
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,675
Or maybe you should give him
some mouth-to-mouth.

387
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:40,552
Grab his ankles.

388
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:43,430
Oh no, now his belt is stuck.

389
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,849
Does he have an inny
or an outy?

390
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:50,234
Get the door!

391
00:27:50,244 --> 00:27:53,946
Open it.

392
00:27:53,956 --> 00:27:56,360
Why is He-Man the guardian
of Castle Greyskull?

393
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,196
The architecture is clearly
more suited to Skeletor.

394
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:02,266
It just-- it just
doesn't make sense.

395
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:27,771
Stellar résumé, kid.

396
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:29,643
What font is this?

397
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:30,810
Cyrillic bold?

398
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,736
Yeah.
Thank you, sir.

399
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,781
I want to offer you
a place here.

400
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:41,237
I want to start you off
with a little more
responsibility than most.

401
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:43,875
How's partner sound?

402
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,116
Sounds great, sir.

403
00:28:45,126 --> 00:28:47,327
I'm gonna write
down a number,

404
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,579
you tell me if you
like what you see

405
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:53,333
and then I'll tell you
if you like what I see.

406
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:55,632
Now clench those cheeks.

407
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:57,128
Come on!

408
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,213
Clench them tight.

409
00:28:58,223 --> 00:29:00,006
Sir?

410
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:03,473
Squeeze them. Hard.
One two, one two.

411
00:29:03,483 --> 00:29:04,886
<i>One two, one two.
That's it.</i>

412
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,262
<i>Feel it in the butt.</i>

413
00:29:06,272 --> 00:29:07,347
<i>Right in the glutes.</i>

414
00:29:07,357 --> 00:29:08,932
<i>Take the glutes
to the next level.</i>

415
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:10,350
<i>You need to feel it there.</i>

416
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,894
<i>When it's burning
in the glutes, you're alive.</i>

417
00:29:12,904 --> 00:29:15,521
<i>If you're not burning,
you're not doing it right.</i>

418
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:18,237
<i>One two, one two.</i>

419
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:20,109
<i>Good. Excellent.</i>

420
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,283
<i>Excellent. Okay.</i>

421
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,946
<i>We're gonna move on
to the calves after this.</i>

422
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:46,886
Oh, it's cold.

423
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:48,763
Whoa! Wait! Wait!

424
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:49,805
Calm down!
Calm down!

425
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:51,223
Everything's
under control.

426
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:52,892
Why am I naked
with another man?

427
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:53,976
Because he saved
your life.

428
00:29:53,986 --> 00:29:54,977
Yeah, that's right.

429
00:29:54,987 --> 00:29:56,646
I saved your life, man.

430
00:29:56,656 --> 00:30:02,656
Here,
see for yourself.

431
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:06,363
You got knocked unconscious
by the side of the road.

432
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,032
See, Orlie
was hitchhiking

433
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:09,325
and he heard me
screaming for help.

434
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:10,326
Who?

435
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:11,410
Orlie.

436
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,876
Short for Orlick.

437
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:15,920
Orlick Prescott Hope.

438
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:19,423
Pleased to meet you.

439
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:21,086
Anyways, we had
to transport your body

440
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:25,176
to the nearest motel we
could find to recuperate.

441
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,775
If you two will excuse me,

442
00:30:42,785 --> 00:30:46,779
I gotta go return a favor
to Mother Nature, again.

443
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:48,489
Okay, we gotta go now.

444
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:51,742
See, I kinda told him
he could come with us.

445
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:53,832
We don't have time.

446
00:30:53,842 --> 00:30:55,746
But he's on the way.

447
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:58,837
Look, I appreciate
what he did.

448
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:01,043
We can give him
a couple of bucks,

449
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:02,169
but he can't come with us.

450
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:03,587
Please?
No.

451
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:05,339
Please?
No, that's--

452
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:06,381
No, I don't.

453
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:07,424
Will you please--

454
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:09,598
How about now?
Okay! Okay!

455
00:31:09,608 --> 00:31:11,892
Yeah?

456
00:31:11,902 --> 00:31:13,180
Okay.
Promise.

457
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,348
Yeah.

458
00:31:14,358 --> 00:31:16,358
Ah!

459
00:31:18,195 --> 00:31:22,319
I know.
Going on a road trip.

460
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,529
Say hi
to your new friend.

461
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:27,444
I have a deep spiritual
connection to pigs.

462
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:29,196
You'll love Rick.

463
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:31,416
Come on, little one.

464
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:40,298
Shotgun!

465
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:45,008
Rick, we are we?

466
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:46,129
In ancient times,

467
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,631
the gods looked
down on humans,

468
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:49,936
jealous of their mortality.

469
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:53,678
Humankind strove to evoke
pity through animal sacrifices.

470
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:56,890
The smoke of the flaming
carcasses rose towards
the heavens,

471
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,523
as a billowing
plea for mercy.

472
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:06,774
Orlie. Orlie!

473
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:09,115
Get off!

474
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,111
Jeez.

475
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:11,988
As a token of goodwill,

476
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:14,324
I ask the gods to bless
our journey this day,

477
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,992
and my two new friends,

478
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:18,661
that they may find
whatever it is that
they are looking for.

479
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:19,913
Amen.

480
00:32:19,923 --> 00:32:22,373
So what, did you join
a cult or invent your own.

481
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:25,953
I'm a shaman of the
Native American church.

482
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:33,051
I'm sorry--

483
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:35,344
You don't look like any
Indian I've ever seen.

484
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:36,512
Don't mind him.

485
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:39,562
Your spirituality
is beautiful.

486
00:32:39,572 --> 00:32:41,225
Rick just has this
charming little way

487
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:42,977
of tearing down
everything you hold dear.

488
00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:45,396
He's just upset
because he's chosen
a life of moral bankruptcy

489
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:47,732
and a succession
of loveless marriages.

490
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:49,822
Really?
Yeah.

491
00:32:49,832 --> 00:32:50,818
That's terrible.

492
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:52,028
You know what?

493
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:53,279
The fact is, that
I've achieved everything

494
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:54,906
I've set out
to do in my life.

495
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:57,163
That bothers people.

496
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:58,826
Who wants to play
the alphabet game?

497
00:32:58,836 --> 00:33:01,167
I do.

498
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:03,878
You guys go ahead.

499
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:09,258
Okay...A.

500
00:33:09,268 --> 00:33:11,844
<i>Ah, a tree.</i>

501
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:13,591
Good one.
Thank you.

502
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:15,342
Okay...B.

503
00:33:15,352 --> 00:33:17,352
B.

504
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,566
Big sign.

505
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:25,394
Double high five.

506
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:26,395
Okay.

507
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,313
Okay...C.

508
00:33:27,323 --> 00:33:29,320
C, c--

509
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,608
Oh, I know.

510
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:32,823
<i>Can we get
some food?</i>

511
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,548
Yeah, that
was a good one.

512
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:39,325
Can you get me a veggie
burger and some fries.

513
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,077
Ooh, and a cherry
caramel milkshake.

514
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,537
Thank you.

515
00:33:43,547 --> 00:33:46,545
Wow, that sounds
really delicious.

516
00:33:46,555 --> 00:33:48,500
This is embarrassing,

517
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,593
but I'm a little
short on cash.

518
00:33:52,603 --> 00:33:54,381
I did save your life, man.

519
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:56,008
Fine.

520
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:58,823
Hundredfold, brother.
Hundredfold.

521
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:04,308
Will you stop hitting me,
please?

522
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:06,059
You know, you and Michelle
make a great couple.

523
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:07,185
We're not dating.

524
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:10,340
Good, 'cause I think
she's digging me.

525
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:12,274
Hey, let's see what
kind of loot she's got.

526
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,284
No.

527
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,280
Don't hit people
in restaurants!

528
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,406
Especially--

529
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:20,699
It's a toy, man!
What's your problem?

530
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,409
Yeah, it's a toy.

531
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:23,535
Get over it.

532
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:26,877
You have exactly
five seconds to apol--

533
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:29,583
Why would you even do that
to a cute, little Mexican kid.

534
00:34:29,593 --> 00:34:31,798
He's Japanese.

535
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,337
You can't just pick
where you're from.

536
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:35,881
Okay, stop talking.

537
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:38,696
My dad's gonna
kick your ass!

538
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:41,428
Dream on, kid.

539
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:44,723
<i>Okay? He took you and
he can take your padré.</i>

540
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:46,558
Is that so?

541
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,568
No, it's--

542
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:51,529
Let's go then.

543
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:58,167
Scram, it's not
your business.

544
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:03,536
He was pretty tough
for a little guy, huh?

545
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,539
So, Orlie,
where are you from?

546
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:12,208
My physical being
hails from Boston.

547
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:14,683
And your spiritual?

548
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,008
I'm what they classify
as a schismatic psyche.

549
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:22,218
In lay terms
that's renegade soul.

550
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:23,428
No way.

551
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:24,929
Yeah.

552
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:26,681
See, what happened is,

553
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,474
when my original body died,

554
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:29,684
the spirit got all freaky

555
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,935
and crossed paths
with someone else's.

556
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:34,188
Now they have my body
and I have theirs.

557
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,732
Happens quite
often actually.

558
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:36,691
That's crazy.

559
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,276
Yeah.

560
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:40,903
Spent the last four years
of my life looking for
a 25-year-old Walapai

561
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:45,078
who doesn't really fit
in with the native culture.

562
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:47,785
You're Indian.

563
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:49,328
That totally makes sense.

564
00:35:49,338 --> 00:35:50,455
Native American.

565
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:51,956
I'm sorry.

566
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:52,999
Isn't that amazing?

567
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,009
Unbelievable.

568
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:58,880
What's your story?

569
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,007
You don't seem
much of a lawyer.

570
00:36:01,017 --> 00:36:02,842
That's what
I've been saying.

571
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:05,011
You should take
a personality test.

572
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:06,554
I'll bet you're yellow.

573
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,894
No, no, he's blue.

574
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:11,193
Give me your palm.

575
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:15,359
Wow, check out
his lifeline.

576
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:17,364
What?

577
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,066
What's the point?

578
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,068
Well, it shows you where you've
been and where you're going

579
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,070
and without that,
you're nothing.

580
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,321
Like navel lint.

581
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:25,781
Nobody knows where
that comes from.

582
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,366
It comes from clothes.

583
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:28,492
That's not the point.

584
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:29,994
It might.
It does.

585
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:31,537
You know that
for a fact?

586
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:33,919
Yeah.
A hundred percent?

587
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,916
I'm pretty sure.
A hundred percent?

588
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:37,543
Okay, not
a hundred percent,

589
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:38,502
but 99.9--

590
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:39,795
See?

591
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,547
See what?
You're not always right!

592
00:36:41,557 --> 00:36:42,590
Here.

593
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,727
Make a wish.

594
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,181
Okay, I hate to beat
this to death

595
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:52,850
because I hate complainers

596
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,810
and I understand that
if we stop again,

597
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,981
the meal might once again
be interrupted by strange
circumstances,

598
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:03,699
but I for one am willing
to take that chance.

599
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:06,034
Oh, please, Rick?
Please?

600
00:37:06,044 --> 00:37:08,162
But we're--
we can't stop!

601
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,252
You owe me a Reuben!

602
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,998
Please, please.
I feel bad,
I do,

603
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:18,213
but we're--

604
00:37:18,223 --> 00:37:19,710
What's he doing?

605
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,711
Orlie!

606
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,004
You're killing him!

607
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:23,422
Orlie!
He's gonna die!

608
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:25,557
We're not stopping!

609
00:37:26,018 --> 00:37:27,175
Every minute we spend here

610
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:29,990
is a minute not spent
on the road.

611
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:34,474
Rick, that is a spiffy
watch you got there.

612
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:36,609
Can I see
it for a minute?

613
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:48,530
I'll get a better one when
your uncle gives me a job.

614
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,662
Oops.

615
00:37:50,672 --> 00:37:52,998
She put it in her boobs.

616
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:55,328
Shelly says you live
on the way.

617
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:56,538
Are we stopping?

618
00:37:56,548 --> 00:37:58,712
No.

619
00:37:58,722 --> 00:38:00,458
Can you please wipe
that off and give it back?

620
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:03,044
I'll give it back to you when
you don't need it anymore.

621
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:04,087
You visit often?

622
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:05,422
Not lately.

623
00:38:05,432 --> 00:38:06,756
Do you have
a girlfriend?

624
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:07,757
Huh! No.

625
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:08,842
He's keeping himself
available

626
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:14,310
for McAllister, Morganstern
and Raphael.

627
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,315
What about her?

628
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,935
She's working.

629
00:38:18,945 --> 00:38:21,860
You could totally
date her.

630
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:25,010
She probably thinks
I'm with Michelle.

631
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,073
Taken care of.

632
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,783
I dare you.

633
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:37,108
I double dog dare
you to go talk to her.

634
00:38:38,297 --> 00:38:41,546
Fine.

635
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:43,551
Watch this.

636
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:53,391
Hello-- Ahem.
Hello.

637
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:57,228
I'm not with her,
I'm single, alone.

638
00:38:57,238 --> 00:38:59,475
I just wanted to say hi,
that's all.

639
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:02,608
Oh...well, hi.

640
00:39:02,618 --> 00:39:04,613
Hello.

641
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:29,477
You know,
I have to go tinkle.

642
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:36,308
Yeah, I think
I'm just gonna go

643
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:38,399
look for some stuff.

644
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:57,668
<i># I called out your name #</i>

645
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:08,507
<i># In a mystic dream
last night #</i>

646
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:11,181
Don't force it.
Just relax.

647
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:16,351
Here.

648
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:23,850
Want a scrub down?

649
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,860
No, thanks.

650
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:32,567
Can I get a small favor?

651
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:35,977
I'm-- I'm a little
favored out right now.

652
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,435
Shelly's right,
you are a "no" person.

653
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:44,546
Okay, what is it?

654
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,958
Can't reach it.

655
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:49,000
Rubs real hard.

656
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:53,755
Maybe you should get
Michelle to do that.

657
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:55,715
No way!

658
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:56,716
Have you ever had a bimple?

659
00:40:56,726 --> 00:40:57,717
A what?

660
00:40:57,727 --> 00:40:58,718
A back pimple.

661
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:00,053
Or a butt pimple.

662
00:41:00,063 --> 00:41:01,930
I already taken care
of those this morning.

663
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,521
Yeah, I have, but--

664
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:05,517
Well, girls
don't get them.

665
00:41:05,527 --> 00:41:06,726
She'd think it's gross.

666
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:08,736
It is gross.

667
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,522
I don't know what to do.

668
00:41:10,532 --> 00:41:11,523
I can't function anymore.

669
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:12,982
It's all I think about.

670
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,734
I can't fit
my pack on right.

671
00:41:14,744 --> 00:41:16,825
They go away.

672
00:41:16,835 --> 00:41:19,786
Release me!

673
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:22,085
Please do it.

674
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:23,493
Please.
I'm not ready.

675
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:25,411
Come on, do it!
Just do it.

676
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:26,788
I can't.

677
00:41:26,798 --> 00:41:27,956
Just poke the bimple.

678
00:41:27,966 --> 00:41:28,957
It's gross.

679
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,833
Give him hell.

680
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:33,508
Look, one fell swoop.

681
00:41:33,518 --> 00:41:36,761
Okay?
Gone and finished.

682
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:38,768
I'm ready.

683
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:43,479
Do it.

684
00:41:54,117 --> 00:41:56,117
My brother!

685
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:01,205
I feel warm.

686
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:08,621
Wait, where's Orlie?

687
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:09,664
He wanted to stay here.

688
00:42:26,065 --> 00:42:30,893
You know, I wish I would
have been able to say
at least good-bye.

689
00:42:30,903 --> 00:42:33,521
Yeah, well, he told me that
I should tell you good-bye

690
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:38,572
for him because he was
going to take a long time.

691
00:42:38,582 --> 00:42:40,830
He was in a hurry.

692
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,835
You left him,
didn't you?

693
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:51,835
Yeah, I did.

694
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:54,041
Between the retainer
and the bacne,

695
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:56,168
I just couldn't
take it anymore.

696
00:42:56,178 --> 00:42:58,509
You could have asked me.

697
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:00,678
You said he could go!

698
00:43:00,688 --> 00:43:02,049
I didn't have
much of a choice.

699
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:05,140
Oh my-- you are
so selfish.

700
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,267
Me?

701
00:43:07,277 --> 00:43:09,223
Oh ho ho ho ho.

702
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:10,933
Oh, whatever!

703
00:43:10,943 --> 00:43:13,107
You're crazy!

704
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:17,528
I'm crazy not talking
to you anymore.

705
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:18,774
Really?

706
00:43:18,784 --> 00:43:20,609
Serious?

707
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:23,075
Well, finally!

708
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:32,376
<i># She's such a lovely
sunny day #</i>

709
00:43:32,386 --> 00:43:37,881
<i># She makes you happy
you've had the rage #</i>

710
00:43:37,891 --> 00:43:41,009
<i># Condensation really pays #</i>

711
00:43:42,808 --> 00:43:45,467
<i># When she makes you
feel this way #</i>

712
00:43:45,477 --> 00:43:47,928
Can she please
eat something else?

713
00:43:47,938 --> 00:43:49,304
<i># Like the blue sky #</i>

714
00:43:49,314 --> 00:43:50,764
Good girl, Dorothy.

715
00:43:50,774 --> 00:43:52,265
Yeah, keep eating.

716
00:43:52,275 --> 00:43:54,606
Go ahead.

717
00:43:54,616 --> 00:43:57,442
Whoa! Can we
stop the truck?

718
00:43:57,452 --> 00:43:59,022
I can't--
I can't do that.

719
00:43:59,032 --> 00:44:02,072
Aw, Rick!
It's the ocean!

720
00:44:02,082 --> 00:44:04,152
Can we please just pull over?

721
00:44:04,162 --> 00:44:06,162
No.

722
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,208
Pull over!

723
00:44:19,386 --> 00:44:23,009
Come on!

724
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:24,047
Get back in the truck.

725
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:25,048
Come on!

726
00:44:25,058 --> 00:44:26,925
I want to show
you something.

727
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:28,551
I'll wait here.

728
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:29,552
No!

729
00:44:29,562 --> 00:44:31,221
You are harboring
negative energy

730
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:32,680
and it's spilling on to me

731
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,814
and I don't want any!

732
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,228
Come on!
Please!

733
00:44:38,238 --> 00:44:40,788
I'm not playing
your games. No!

734
00:44:41,616 --> 00:44:45,990
Okay, so just look
at the ocean.

735
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,995
Now breathe.

736
00:44:52,048 --> 00:44:53,117
Slowly!

737
00:44:53,127 --> 00:44:54,911
Clear your mind.

738
00:44:54,921 --> 00:44:57,288
Just concentrate
on your breathing.

739
00:44:57,298 --> 00:45:00,046
Okay, in...out.

740
00:45:00,056 --> 00:45:02,840
In with the good,

741
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:06,511
out with the bad.

742
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:08,925
Oh!

743
00:45:08,935 --> 00:45:11,060
Please don't answer that!

744
00:45:12,855 --> 00:45:13,846
Hey, Carl.

745
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:14,931
Come on,
let me talk to him.

746
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:17,099
You have a minus-two
penalty to your hit roll

747
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:20,733
because you're blind
right now, think!

748
00:45:20,743 --> 00:45:22,396
Hey, Rick, I haven't
seen you in a while.

749
00:45:22,406 --> 00:45:23,439
Are you sick?

750
00:45:23,449 --> 00:45:24,440
What's the deal?

751
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,816
Carl, I'm
on the road.
Come on!

752
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:26,817
I'm moving McAllister.

753
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:29,367
Oh yeah.

754
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:30,363
Hey, is she there?

755
00:45:30,373 --> 00:45:31,530
Yeah.

756
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,157
Oh, wait, come on,
he wants to talk to me.

757
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:34,700
Stop it.

758
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:35,868
Listen, Bombadil,

759
00:45:35,878 --> 00:45:37,244
I'm the dungeon master.

760
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:38,621
You can either roll again

761
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:40,790
or I can dock you a thousand
experience points

762
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,957
for not playing in character.

763
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:44,752
<i>Carl! Carl!
Thanks.</i>

764
00:45:44,762 --> 00:45:46,629
Carl, I need you
to change my flight.

765
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:49,590
Get me on the last one
out of L.A. on Monday, okay?

766
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,591
Okay, sure.

767
00:45:50,601 --> 00:45:52,640
Come on!
Come on!

768
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,386
Will you shut up!
Come on.

769
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,020
I think we're done
for the day.

770
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,980
Carl?

771
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,607
Carl?

772
00:46:06,617 --> 00:46:09,823
I am so sorry.

773
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,779
Oh!

774
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:13,197
I'm so sorry.

775
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:15,199
It was an accident,
honest.

776
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:16,867
I just want you
to enjoy yourself

777
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:18,877
for at least
one minute.

778
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,430
I enjoyed that.

779
00:46:41,943 --> 00:46:43,101
Good?

780
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:44,519
Nope.

781
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:46,521
How long does
it take you, girl?

782
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:48,231
Oh, shut up!

783
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:49,316
How about now?

784
00:46:49,326 --> 00:46:50,400
No.

785
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:51,401
Now?
No.

786
00:46:51,411 --> 00:46:53,408
Now?
No.

787
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:55,113
No.

788
00:46:55,123 --> 00:46:56,114
Are you done?

789
00:46:56,124 --> 00:46:59,164
Yes.

790
00:46:59,174 --> 00:47:00,744
Aw, you've been
driving all day.

791
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:02,078
Aren't you tired?

792
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:03,121
Yes.

793
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:04,706
Well, then,
why can't I drive?

794
00:47:04,716 --> 00:47:06,458
Because--
I know how
to drive a stick.

795
00:47:06,468 --> 00:47:08,293
I-I believe you.

796
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:11,087
You know what?
If I died, it's your fault,
I'm going to be really upset.

797
00:47:11,097 --> 00:47:13,965
Uncle Max is going to be
devastated.

798
00:47:13,975 --> 00:47:17,140
Mr. McAllister
is going to freak out.

799
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,310
I know.
Please.

800
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,558
Okay look, let me make you
a deal. Just listen, okay.
Hear me out.

801
00:47:23,568 --> 00:47:27,771
How about we switch off,
we never have to stop,
and we just keep driving?

802
00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:30,690
Please, please,
please, please!
I...okay.

803
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,108
What?

804
00:47:32,118 --> 00:47:33,902
Okay.
Really?

805
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:36,868
Yeah.
Oh! Alright.
Come on.

806
00:47:36,878 --> 00:47:42,624
Putting my life
in my hands.
Oh, shhh!

807
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:43,620
Get it?  You got it?
Yeah.

808
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,633
Okay.
I got it.

809
00:47:50,845 --> 00:47:53,296
Are you good?
Yeah, I'm so
good. Whoo!

810
00:47:53,306 --> 00:47:56,387
This is nice.
Yeah, really.

811
00:47:56,397 --> 00:47:58,772
I think I'll
take a nap.
Okay.

812
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,815
What?
Nothing.

813
00:48:08,905 --> 00:48:11,115
You're just...
go to sleep!

814
00:49:22,186 --> 00:49:24,186
Your mommy says
go home.

815
00:49:25,814 --> 00:49:28,061
Hi, Richie.

816
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:30,522
Richie, hi.

817
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:32,527
What a surprise!

818
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,690
Mom?

819
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,151
Okay, I know you wouldn't have
done this for yourself,

820
00:49:39,161 --> 00:49:44,573
so, I looked at your driver's
license and I drove all night
and, you're home!

821
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:47,617
Now listen, you two
just get right in the
house and get warm.

822
00:49:47,627 --> 00:49:51,877
I'm going to make
you the best waffles
in the world.

823
00:49:56,386 --> 00:50:01,047
I can't believe you did this!
We should be in Arizona by now.

824
00:50:01,057 --> 00:50:04,055
Okay. Can't we just say hi?
Please?

825
00:50:04,065 --> 00:50:06,845
We're already here,
and she's making waffles.

826
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:08,855
We can't just leave.

827
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:13,818
Okay.

828
00:50:16,823 --> 00:50:19,608
There's something you
should know about my dad.

829
00:50:19,618 --> 00:50:21,067
He's different.

830
00:50:21,077 --> 00:50:23,077
He's weird.

831
00:50:30,712 --> 00:50:32,712
What's your name, son?

832
00:50:34,591 --> 00:50:36,591
Mrs. Robinson?

833
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,130
All right,

834
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,590
so, how do
we do this?

835
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,307
I like a lot of
strawberries.

836
00:50:47,317 --> 00:50:49,312
And syrup.

837
00:50:50,857 --> 00:50:52,857
And butter.

838
00:50:56,362 --> 00:50:58,896
So how long have
you had super powers?

839
00:50:58,906 --> 00:51:01,566
Who told you I
have super powers?

840
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:04,407
Oh, I have 'em, too.

841
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:07,201
How long has that
been going on?

842
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:10,621
Well, I've been able
to fly for about...

843
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:13,958
six-and-a-half years now.

844
00:51:13,968 --> 00:51:15,121
Flying's good.

845
00:51:15,131 --> 00:51:17,131
Yeah.

846
00:51:17,884 --> 00:51:20,344
Butter?
Yes, please.

847
00:51:22,722 --> 00:51:24,839
Would you like me to
warm this up for you?

848
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,849
Oh, yes, please.

849
00:51:32,023 --> 00:51:34,265
These waffles are
unbelievable.

850
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:36,570
Thank you.
it's my pleasure.

851
00:51:45,286 --> 00:51:49,864
Do you think I could
take a picture with
you, Mr. Robinson?

852
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:51,874
I guess so.

853
00:51:53,836 --> 00:51:57,376
Visible or
invisible?

854
00:51:57,386 --> 00:51:58,789
Invisible.

855
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:02,172
Can you wait
just a minute?
Yeah, yeah.

856
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:03,544
Oh, no
you don't!

857
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:06,297
Now you stop that.
You stop that,
right now!

858
00:52:06,307 --> 00:52:09,592
What have I said? Get
your-- Will you stop it?

859
00:52:09,602 --> 00:52:12,177
You can't see me!
I'm invisible!
Stop it! Right now!

860
00:52:12,187 --> 00:52:14,680
You can't see me!
Stop it, William.

861
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,181
Can't see me!
Yes I can.

862
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:19,977
William,
William, listen to me.
You are not invisible.

863
00:52:19,987 --> 00:52:21,987
Mom.

864
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,858
Rick.

865
00:52:25,868 --> 00:52:29,324
Hi, Dad.

866
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:32,286
What are you doing here?

867
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:34,918
We're having breakfast.

868
00:52:37,629 --> 00:52:41,545
Well, leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

869
00:52:41,555 --> 00:52:44,251
Oh honey, just go wait
downstairs, please.

870
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:47,661
He doesn't want you
to see him like this.

871
00:52:47,723 --> 00:52:50,392
It's okay.
Shhh.....

872
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
How ya doing?

873
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:03,695
Let's just go, okay?

874
00:53:37,105 --> 00:53:39,686
He's okay now,
he's sleeping.

875
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:42,350
He's really glad
you came, Richie.

876
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,601
I'm really sorry.
Honestly, I didn't know.

877
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:46,187
Oh, he'll be fine.
Don't you worry.

878
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:48,570
You're welcome
anytime.

879
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,692
Are you coming
for Christmas?

880
00:53:50,702 --> 00:53:52,443
I don't know
if I can yet.

881
00:53:52,453 --> 00:53:56,030
Oh honey, I'd much
rather you come and
see us than send checks.

882
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,657
We're not going to
starve, you know.

883
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,117
I know, Mom.

884
00:53:59,127 --> 00:54:03,584
Well, I told your father
you would come back, so...

885
00:54:03,594 --> 00:54:07,797
Could you please come
back for Christmas?

886
00:54:07,807 --> 00:54:09,502
Okay. Okay.

887
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:13,015
Oh great.
I'll be back for Christmas.

888
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:34,657
Was he always like this?

889
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:36,662
No.

890
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:41,330
He used to be
really cool.

891
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,120
But when I was about 15,
he lost his job,

892
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,080
and his mind,

893
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,087
and most of our money.

894
00:54:48,097 --> 00:54:50,584
It's a real treat
bringing friends home.

895
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:54,164
Especially when he
decided to be invisible.

896
00:54:55,766 --> 00:55:00,719
Yeah, well, if it makes you
feel any better, my father
actually was invisible.

897
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:06,183
He left when I was young,
and mom didn't really cope
with it well, so...

898
00:55:06,193 --> 00:55:09,144
I went to live with my
uncle when I was thirteen.

899
00:55:09,154 --> 00:55:10,145
I'm sorry.

900
00:55:10,155 --> 00:55:11,939
It's all right,
don't be.

901
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:14,244
I turned out okay,
didn't I?

902
00:55:15,577 --> 00:55:17,579
Oh, thanks.

903
00:55:18,956 --> 00:55:20,114
What?

904
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:21,949
Uh, nothing.

905
00:55:21,959 --> 00:55:24,368
Put your glasses on.
You're making me nervous.

906
00:55:24,378 --> 00:55:25,911
My eyes are tired.

907
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:27,121
You know, I could
always drive.

908
00:55:27,131 --> 00:55:29,712
Yeah, I don't think so.

909
00:55:29,722 --> 00:55:34,902
After what happened last time,
we'd probably end up in Alaska.

910
00:55:40,435 --> 00:55:43,262
I did mention the gas gauge
was broken, didn't I?

911
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:44,429
Yes.
Didn't I?

912
00:55:44,439 --> 00:55:45,931
Yes, yes you did.

913
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:48,934
And I accept the consequences
for it.
Consequences?

914
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:50,983
What would those be?

915
00:55:50,993 --> 00:55:54,116
My ass is on the line,
not yours!

916
00:56:00,038 --> 00:56:03,203
Whoa, whoa.
Rick. Rick!

917
00:56:03,213 --> 00:56:05,627
You ruined my life!

918
00:56:16,805 --> 00:56:19,140
That was rude, wasn't it?

919
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:26,518
Okay. Okay. You know
what we're going to do?

920
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:28,932
We are going to pretend
this didn't happen

921
00:56:28,942 --> 00:56:34,025
and that we're just taking
a little break, okay?

922
00:56:34,035 --> 00:56:36,236
Okay.

923
00:56:36,246 --> 00:56:38,738
And, I apologize.

924
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:43,952
Oh, you gotta be kidding.

925
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,180
Save Dorothy!

926
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:36,379
I can't believe this
is happening to me.

927
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:40,675
You do realize I have to
be on a plane in 24 hours.

928
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:42,588
Can't you take
the bar another time?

929
00:57:42,598 --> 00:57:45,388
I'll lose my job.

930
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:49,387
I was valedictorian.
Top of my class in law
school. Straight A's.

931
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:51,435
All the way through.

932
00:57:51,445 --> 00:57:53,849
I can't mess up now.
Not even this once.

933
00:57:53,859 --> 00:57:58,275
Do you really care
about this job that much?

934
00:57:58,285 --> 00:58:01,904
It's everything
I've worked for.

935
00:58:01,914 --> 00:58:03,859
It's everything
I've ever wanted.

936
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:06,826
Everything?

937
00:58:06,836 --> 00:58:08,831
Yeah.

938
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:13,369
Okay, then.

939
00:58:13,379 --> 00:58:16,539
Okay. If this job means
that much to you,

940
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:20,542
then I promise I will
do everything in my
power to get us there.

941
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:21,919
We're going to make it.

942
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:24,734
All right?
We're going to make it.

943
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:29,408
Just as soon as
someone comes along.

944
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:56,083
Hey guys!

945
00:58:56,093 --> 00:58:58,126
Orlie!

946
00:58:58,136 --> 00:59:00,258
I told you.

947
00:59:05,472 --> 00:59:07,808
Okay. Come on.

948
00:59:13,188 --> 00:59:15,823
Thanks a lot.
You're good to go.

949
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:36,326
No, d-d-don't
wake him up.

950
00:59:36,336 --> 00:59:38,376
Don't wake him up.
Sorry.

951
00:59:42,092 --> 00:59:45,382
So, what's your
ex-boyfriend do?

952
00:59:45,392 --> 00:59:47,387
He used to be
a fireman.

953
00:59:48,181 --> 00:59:49,964
Well, that's
interesting.

954
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:51,758
Wow.

955
00:59:51,768 --> 00:59:54,052
Well, there's not as
many fires as you think.

956
00:59:54,062 --> 00:59:57,477
So, why are you
scared of girls?

957
00:59:57,487 --> 00:59:58,765
I'm not.

958
00:59:58,775 --> 01:00:00,777
You can't talk to them.

959
01:00:00,819 --> 01:00:02,644
I'm talking to you.

960
01:00:02,654 --> 01:00:05,629
Well, that's a
little different.
How?

961
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:09,364
Okay, let's practice.

962
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:11,194
Pretend I'm
this beautiful,

963
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:13,368
very beautiful woman.

964
01:00:13,378 --> 01:00:16,032
And we're on a train,
and it's cold,

965
01:00:16,042 --> 01:00:18,242
so I have to sit
very close to you.

966
01:00:18,252 --> 01:00:20,833
Okay?
Okay.

967
01:00:20,843 --> 01:00:22,838
Hello.

968
01:00:26,511 --> 01:00:28,961
Hi, do you want
to go out with me?

969
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:30,296
Yeah, okay,

970
01:00:30,306 --> 01:00:33,508
or you could just
introduce yourself first.

971
01:00:33,518 --> 01:00:35,640
Okay.
Okay.

972
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,184
Hello.

973
01:00:38,194 --> 01:00:40,353
Hi, I'm Rick.

974
01:00:40,363 --> 01:00:42,308
Hello, Rick.

975
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:45,061
What do you do?

976
01:00:45,071 --> 01:00:46,812
I'm a law intern.

977
01:00:46,822 --> 01:00:48,272
Yeah, okay,
when you meet someone,

978
01:00:48,282 --> 01:00:49,941
you want to put
your best foot forward.

979
01:00:49,951 --> 01:00:51,400
Okay? So, say...

980
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,569
Say you're taking
the bar exam in 20 hours,

981
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:54,945
and you have
this amazing job
lined up

982
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:58,537
with the best
law firm in Miami.
All right?

983
01:00:58,547 --> 01:01:01,582
All right.

984
01:01:01,592 --> 01:01:05,044
So, Rick,

985
01:01:05,054 --> 01:01:07,713
where do you live?

986
01:01:07,723 --> 01:01:09,502
Miami, Florida, USA.

987
01:01:09,512 --> 01:01:12,218
Oh! Oh, Miami,
I love Miami!

988
01:01:12,228 --> 01:01:14,965
Oh, the beach,
the ocean, the sand...

989
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:17,431
oh, the water, oh...

990
01:01:20,152 --> 01:01:22,436
Are you okay?

991
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:24,647
I'm sorry.

992
01:01:24,657 --> 01:01:28,948
Wow, yikes.
Skin walkers are coming.

993
01:01:33,452 --> 01:01:36,111
I liked how you were
with my dad.

994
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:38,452
Yeah?

995
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:43,047
Well, actors have
a lot in common
with the mentally ill.

996
01:01:46,215 --> 01:01:50,130
Well, I'm glad
you're here.

997
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,971
I think we're
gonna make it.

998
01:02:02,356 --> 01:02:04,056
I gotta call Carl.

999
01:02:04,066 --> 01:02:06,058
Oh, good, because
I really need to tinkle.

1000
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:08,737
Don't force it.

1001
01:02:13,241 --> 01:02:16,068
...and all I see
around me are the stars,

1002
01:02:16,078 --> 01:02:19,284
I'm naked, and, uh,

1003
01:02:19,294 --> 01:02:21,031
I speak Portuguese
for some reason.

1004
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:22,365
Why Portuguese?

1005
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:25,619
Well, because it's
a beautiful language.
Hello?

1006
01:02:25,629 --> 01:02:26,870
Carl, it's Rick!

1007
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,330
<i>Who?
Rick.</i>

1008
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,377
<i>Rick who?
Copy room Rick.</i>

1009
01:02:30,387 --> 01:02:31,750
Hey, Rick.

1010
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,211
Oh, I booked you
on the 7:30 out of LAX.

1011
01:02:34,221 --> 01:02:36,129
It's the last one
if you want to make the Bar.

1012
01:02:36,139 --> 01:02:38,965
Great, we'll still have
a couple hours to spare.

1013
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:40,467
Hey, how's
the studying going?

1014
01:02:40,477 --> 01:02:41,968
Pretty good, pretty good.

1015
01:02:41,978 --> 01:02:43,345
Could we get
some more eel sauce?
Sure.

1016
01:02:43,355 --> 01:02:45,847
Thank you.
You want to go
get that right now?

1017
01:02:45,857 --> 01:02:48,141
Carl, you need to think
about the future.

1018
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:49,809
<i>In the immortal
words of He-Man,</i>

1019
01:02:49,819 --> 01:02:54,277
<i>"There is magic all around us,
if we stop to see it."</i>

1020
01:02:54,287 --> 01:02:56,524
<i>Or was that Lion-O
from the Thundercats?</i>

1021
01:02:56,534 --> 01:02:58,443
Uh, I have to go, Rick.

1022
01:02:58,453 --> 01:03:02,791
I'm... I'm
entertaining someone.

1023
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,868
Okay, come on,
let's go.

1024
01:03:06,878 --> 01:03:08,878
In a minute.

1025
01:03:09,881 --> 01:03:12,337
Dance with me.

1026
01:03:12,347 --> 01:03:13,917
What?

1027
01:03:13,927 --> 01:03:15,126
Dance with me.

1028
01:03:15,136 --> 01:03:17,295
Really? What about
the Bar exam?

1029
01:03:17,305 --> 01:03:19,213
What about your dream job?
What, did you forget?

1030
01:03:19,223 --> 01:03:21,554
Five minutes.
One dance.

1031
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,092
Live a little.

1032
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:24,510
What would Uncle Max say?

1033
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,929
I really don't care
what Uncle Max
would say right now.

1034
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:29,317
Oh...Oh!

1035
01:03:33,905 --> 01:03:39,822
<i># This night belongs
to you and me #</i>

1036
01:03:39,832 --> 01:03:44,827
<i># You can only
be what matters #</i>

1037
01:03:44,837 --> 01:03:47,830
<i># Because you're
seeing all I need #</i>

1038
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:52,168
<i># Your kiss was
all that mattered #</i>

1039
01:03:52,178 --> 01:03:58,132
<i># It would take the world
to bring me down #</i>

1040
01:03:58,142 --> 01:04:03,012
<i># The whole world to down #</i>

1041
01:04:03,022 --> 01:04:05,092
<i># It would take the world #</i>

1042
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:10,858
<i># To bring me down #</i>

1043
01:04:18,365 --> 01:04:21,155
That ain't yours!

1044
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,040
That happens.

1045
01:04:44,683 --> 01:04:47,828
Hey, what's happening--

1046
01:05:03,702 --> 01:05:06,445
You know, you're actually
a really good dancer.

1047
01:05:06,455 --> 01:05:08,455
Thank you.

1048
01:05:11,793 --> 01:05:14,428
Skin walkers are coming.

1049
01:05:24,306 --> 01:05:26,173
Oh, my God.
Orlie!

1050
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:27,758
Locke, don't open
the hatch!

1051
01:05:27,768 --> 01:05:29,973
Orlie,
are you okay?

1052
01:05:29,983 --> 01:05:32,100
Orlie.
Yeah, I'm okay.

1053
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:34,014
Rick, what are you doing?

1054
01:05:34,024 --> 01:05:36,683
Waiting for a semi
to come finish me off.

1055
01:05:36,693 --> 01:05:38,899
No, we can't
just give up.

1056
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:41,484
The truck's gone!
Wow.

1057
01:05:41,494 --> 01:05:43,570
Yeah, but
so is Dorothy.

1058
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,890
Well, at least
they didn't take
my stuff.

1059
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:52,907
Y'all okay?

1060
01:05:52,917 --> 01:05:55,623
Lost my truck.

1061
01:05:55,633 --> 01:05:57,078
Left it
right here.

1062
01:05:57,088 --> 01:05:59,586
What do you drive?

1063
01:05:59,596 --> 01:06:01,629
A Paradise.

1064
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,261
Paradise, I'm sorry--

1065
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:09,674
I'm sorry for that.

1066
01:06:09,684 --> 01:06:13,766
Earl, who'd steal
a damn Paradise truck?

1067
01:06:13,776 --> 01:06:16,019
Oh...

1068
01:06:16,029 --> 01:06:17,724
Oh, you think
the Lady's got it?

1069
01:06:17,734 --> 01:06:20,398
Maybe.

1070
01:06:20,408 --> 01:06:21,936
Now, when you guys
see the Lady,

1071
01:06:21,946 --> 01:06:24,694
you've got
to be respectful.

1072
01:06:24,704 --> 01:06:26,107
Is she someone
important?

1073
01:06:26,117 --> 01:06:29,687
Yeah, if'n you want
to get your truck back.

1074
01:06:31,956 --> 01:06:34,495
So, she knows
where it is?

1075
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:36,998
The Lady knows
everything.
Yup.

1076
01:06:37,008 --> 01:06:39,208
Lady knowed
everything.

1077
01:06:39,218 --> 01:06:42,336
You'll get
your truck back,

1078
01:06:42,346 --> 01:06:44,341
or...

1079
01:06:55,062 --> 01:06:57,054
It's that big door
over there.

1080
01:06:57,064 --> 01:07:00,187
Now, ya'll ask
for the Lady,

1081
01:07:00,197 --> 01:07:02,481
all right?
Okay.

1082
01:07:02,491 --> 01:07:03,769
Well, get out!

1083
01:07:03,779 --> 01:07:06,110
Come on, now!

1084
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,534
Thank you.
Get going.

1085
01:07:12,872 --> 01:07:14,321
All right, remember,

1086
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:17,908
don't let the door hit you
where the good Lord split you.

1087
01:07:29,889 --> 01:07:31,255
There's no one here.

1088
01:07:31,265 --> 01:07:35,723
Me and my friends
want to see the Lady!

1089
01:07:35,733 --> 01:07:39,565
No, no, just
wait a minute.

1090
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:47,401
Hi.

1091
01:07:47,411 --> 01:07:49,616
We're here
to see the Lady.

1092
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,527
Yeah.

1093
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:56,613
I have a bad feeling
about this.

1094
01:07:56,623 --> 01:07:59,700
Come on, show a little
backbone, will you?

1095
01:08:50,969 --> 01:08:52,377
You.

1096
01:08:52,387 --> 01:08:53,753
Yeah?

1097
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:56,047
What's the capital
of Kentucky?

1098
01:08:56,057 --> 01:08:58,179
Lexington.

1099
01:08:58,189 --> 01:09:00,932
Frankfort.

1100
01:09:00,942 --> 01:09:02,262
Louisville?

1101
01:09:02,272 --> 01:09:05,395
Frankfort.

1102
01:09:05,405 --> 01:09:08,982
Knowledge.

1103
01:09:08,992 --> 01:09:12,819
You know what
I'm saying?

1104
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:16,067
Now, I really don't cotton
much to strangers

1105
01:09:16,077 --> 01:09:19,445
just dropping by
uninvited in my little
establishment here,

1106
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:22,657
so, you'd better have
a very good reason.

1107
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:25,665
Someone stole
our truck.

1108
01:09:25,675 --> 01:09:29,210
I don't see anybody
talking to you, skirt.

1109
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,957
Yeah, but I--
Someone stole our truck.

1110
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:33,339
Mmm, you think I took it.

1111
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:35,388
No, I-- I mean,
never.

1112
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,427
But supposin' I did,

1113
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:41,597
I wonder what could
possibly be in it for me.

1114
01:09:41,607 --> 01:09:47,603
Oh, well...I've got,
like, 34 bucks in change.

1115
01:09:47,613 --> 01:09:51,107
And you can have him.

1116
01:09:51,117 --> 01:09:54,777
Or, you two boys
could work it off.

1117
01:09:54,787 --> 01:09:56,904
I've been
just itching...

1118
01:09:56,914 --> 01:09:59,615
to smell myself
some new blood.

1119
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:02,154
Hey, Vincent!

1120
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:05,366
Tell the boys we gonna
have ourselves...

1121
01:10:05,376 --> 01:10:08,249
a show!

1122
01:10:08,259 --> 01:10:11,544
I'm sorry, sir,
w-when you say "blood,"

1123
01:10:11,554 --> 01:10:12,957
what do you mean?

1124
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:15,464
Hey, you ever
see that movie?

1125
01:10:15,474 --> 01:10:17,003
It's called,

1126
01:10:17,013 --> 01:10:20,511
<i>Mad Max Beyond
Thunderdome.</i>

1127
01:10:20,521 --> 01:10:23,681
Only, like,
17 times.

1128
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:25,896
<i>Mad Max Beyond
Thunderdome.</i>

1129
01:10:43,163 --> 01:10:46,031
<i># Where are all
the real men now #</i>

1130
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:49,373
<i># One who leads the pack? #</i>

1131
01:10:49,383 --> 01:10:52,710
<i># Someone when the smoke
has cleared #</i>

1132
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:56,046
<i># He's ready to attack #</i>

1133
01:10:56,056 --> 01:10:58,721
<i># It's hard to be
a wrestler #</i>

1134
01:10:58,762 --> 01:11:02,386
<i># There's gonna be disaster #</i>

1135
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:04,716
<i># Because we need
a great defender #</i>

1136
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:08,308
<i># That will fight you
till the end #</i>

1137
01:11:08,318 --> 01:11:12,479
<i># Looking for the champion #</i>

1138
01:11:12,489 --> 01:11:15,018
<i># A hero that's going
right to the top #</i>

1139
01:11:15,028 --> 01:11:18,605
<i># He's got to be willing,
he's got to be bold #</i>

1140
01:11:18,615 --> 01:11:21,400
<i># No one can touch him,
It's for the gold #</i>

1141
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,658
<i># Looking for the champion #</i>

1142
01:11:24,668 --> 01:11:28,448
<i># A man made of armor,
a knight made of steel #</i>

1143
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:33,417
<i># He's got to be heavy,
he's got to be real #</i>

1144
01:11:33,427 --> 01:11:35,622
Let's not do this!

1145
01:11:35,632 --> 01:11:36,873
It's our destiny.

1146
01:11:36,883 --> 01:11:39,965
You boys put on
a good show, now,

1147
01:11:39,975 --> 01:11:43,552
because I'm going
to be thinking real hard

1148
01:11:43,562 --> 01:11:46,383
about what happened to that
there truck of yours.

1149
01:11:46,393 --> 01:11:48,301
I won't fail you.

1150
01:11:48,311 --> 01:11:50,892
Listen up!

1151
01:11:50,902 --> 01:11:55,647
Last man standing... wins!

1152
01:11:55,657 --> 01:11:58,061
So we can hit
below the belt, right?

1153
01:11:58,071 --> 01:12:00,986
Hey, Vincent,

1154
01:12:00,996 --> 01:12:04,828
give me 500 bucks down
on this here red boy.

1155
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,489
What about biting?

1156
01:12:09,499 --> 01:12:12,335
And gouging?
Can we gouge?

1157
01:12:15,046 --> 01:12:16,746
Okay, Orlie, we just
got to sell it.

1158
01:12:16,756 --> 01:12:19,045
Make it look good.

1159
01:12:35,817 --> 01:12:38,361
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

1160
01:12:45,368 --> 01:12:47,370
Go, Red, go!

1161
01:12:57,588 --> 01:13:00,169
Whoa!

1162
01:13:09,647 --> 01:13:11,509
Argh!

1163
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:13,975
Green! Green! Green!

1164
01:13:19,694 --> 01:13:21,185
Ohh!

1165
01:13:33,749 --> 01:13:35,749
Get him!

1166
01:13:45,511 --> 01:13:47,511
Ahhh!

1167
01:15:29,364 --> 01:15:30,897
Hey, Rick, are you okay?

1168
01:15:30,907 --> 01:15:33,488
Rick?

1169
01:15:33,498 --> 01:15:37,408
Aw, he'll be fine.

1170
01:15:38,748 --> 01:15:40,740
What about the truck
and the pig?

1171
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:44,165
Mmm...well.

1172
01:15:44,175 --> 01:15:47,705
Now, that would be sort of
unfortunate-like, because--

1173
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:49,374
You don't understand.

1174
01:15:49,384 --> 01:15:50,625
We've got to get
that truck back.

1175
01:15:50,635 --> 01:15:54,675
No. You don't understand.

1176
01:15:54,685 --> 01:15:56,964
Look, in the past three days,

1177
01:15:56,974 --> 01:15:58,758
I've been drugged
by Bohemians,

1178
01:15:58,768 --> 01:16:01,761
stuck in a filthy Jacuzzi
with a couple
hillbilly swingers,

1179
01:16:01,771 --> 01:16:04,263
woke up naked
in a motel next to him,

1180
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:08,142
and then was forced by a man
who calls himself the Lady

1181
01:16:08,152 --> 01:16:10,645
to fight in a cage
like an animal.

1182
01:16:10,655 --> 01:16:13,194
You put on one good show,

1183
01:16:13,204 --> 01:16:16,150
and I even made
a couple of bucks
off Little Red there,

1184
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:21,494
so, makes me feel all warm
and generous-like inside.

1185
01:16:21,504 --> 01:16:23,324
You earned it.

1186
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:27,244
But you little ones,
you be real careful, okay?

1187
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:35,377
All right, man, you did it!

1188
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,598
We're back on the road!

1189
01:16:47,655 --> 01:16:51,315
Om...

1190
01:16:55,037 --> 01:16:59,323
# 27 bottles of root beer
on the wall #

1191
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:03,077
# Take one down,
you pass it around #

1192
01:17:03,087 --> 01:17:06,752
# 27 bottles of beer
on the wall #

1193
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:12,169
Ah!
# 26 bottles of beer
on the wall... #

1194
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:15,489
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop the truck!

1195
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:36,730
This is it.

1196
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,862
Somewhere over there,

1197
01:17:38,872 --> 01:17:42,527
I'm going to find the place
where my body is waiting...

1198
01:17:42,537 --> 01:17:47,037
waiting for its true owner.

1199
01:17:47,047 --> 01:17:49,956
Congratulations.

1200
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:52,125
Take care, brother.

1201
01:17:52,135 --> 01:17:54,080
Thanks, Orlie.

1202
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:55,373
Sorry about
leaving you.

1203
01:17:55,383 --> 01:17:57,292
The whole bimple thing
threw me off a little.

1204
01:17:57,302 --> 01:17:58,460
No worries, friend.

1205
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,759
Here.

1206
01:18:00,769 --> 01:18:01,963
Take this.

1207
01:18:01,973 --> 01:18:05,013
I won't need
this anymore.

1208
01:18:05,023 --> 01:18:06,176
Thanks.

1209
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:10,477
Oh, you be careful.

1210
01:18:10,487 --> 01:18:12,984
Don't worry about me.

1211
01:18:13,026 --> 01:18:15,916
You two just keep up
the good work.

1212
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:24,245
Until we meet again.

1213
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:36,789
Well, just think,

1214
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,500
in a few hours,
this'll be all over.

1215
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:40,757
Finally.

1216
01:18:40,767 --> 01:18:42,420
Can't you just pretend
you're going to miss me

1217
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:44,130
for one minute?

1218
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,674
I could, but I'm really
tired right now.

1219
01:18:46,684 --> 01:18:49,515
Seriously.

1220
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:52,597
I mean, do you think
we'll see each other again?

1221
01:18:52,607 --> 01:18:55,146
Honestly...

1222
01:18:55,156 --> 01:18:57,779
I don't know.

1223
01:19:02,116 --> 01:19:06,026
Well, you don't fail
to spoil a moment, do you?

1224
01:19:06,537 --> 01:19:09,494
Well, what do
you expect? I mean,

1225
01:19:09,504 --> 01:19:12,867
we're both going to go
our separate ways.

1226
01:19:12,877 --> 01:19:16,787
You're going to go to Hollywood
to become a big actress.

1227
01:19:16,797 --> 01:19:19,999
And I'm going to be
a money-hungry lawyer.

1228
01:19:20,009 --> 01:19:23,007
It's very simple.

1229
01:19:23,017 --> 01:19:25,765
Really, what's changed?

1230
01:19:29,518 --> 01:19:32,271
Nothing, I guess.

1231
01:19:41,697 --> 01:19:44,332
Maybe you should
get some sleep.

1232
01:20:31,663 --> 01:20:33,832
You made it.

1233
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,045
You're late.

1234
01:20:48,055 --> 01:20:50,520
Well, we hit
a few snags, sir.

1235
01:20:52,559 --> 01:20:54,718
Can you open up
the crate for me?

1236
01:20:54,728 --> 01:20:57,392
Y-- Yeah.

1237
01:20:57,402 --> 01:20:59,181
There's a surprise
for you in there,

1238
01:20:59,191 --> 01:21:01,486
a token of my appreciation.

1239
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,950
Go on.

1240
01:21:24,966 --> 01:21:28,548
You're-- You're looking
for something...

1241
01:21:28,558 --> 01:21:30,553
quite small.

1242
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:47,539
I thought you
might like it back.

1243
01:21:52,952 --> 01:21:54,193
I called you a cab.

1244
01:21:54,203 --> 01:21:57,123
You can leave the truck here.

1245
01:22:20,688 --> 01:22:25,438
<i># At least, come join me #</i>

1246
01:22:25,448 --> 01:22:29,066
<i># Within the belly
of the big blue sea #</i>

1247
01:22:29,076 --> 01:22:32,987
<i># Set a sail,
catch a breeze #</i>

1248
01:22:32,997 --> 01:22:38,075
<i># Come on, don't forget
to fill your suitcase #</i>

1249
01:22:38,085 --> 01:22:40,202
<i># Now watch it sink #</i>

1250
01:22:40,212 --> 01:22:43,993
<i># Because where we're going
we don't need a thing #</i>

1251
01:22:44,003 --> 01:22:47,626
<i># Not a map, or a receipt #</i>

1252
01:22:47,636 --> 01:22:51,333
<i># Because where we've been
is who we used to be #</i>

1253
01:22:51,343 --> 01:22:55,092
<i># We started wrapping
our regrets in cloth #</i>

1254
01:22:55,102 --> 01:23:00,014
<i># Are you defined by all
the things you want #</i>

1255
01:23:00,024 --> 01:23:05,899
<i># Or did you get
caught up in the things
that we are not? #</i>

1256
01:23:05,941 --> 01:23:08,193
Airport?
All right.

1257
01:23:15,034 --> 01:23:17,034
Thanks.

1258
01:23:18,662 --> 01:23:22,411
<i># You were born to believe # </i>

1259
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:24,538
<i># You can't get lost #</i>

1260
01:23:24,548 --> 01:23:27,703
<i># So when you'd run,
you'd always get too far #</i>

1261
01:23:27,713 --> 01:23:32,087
<i># Now there's nothing
you haven't seen #</i>

1262
01:23:32,097 --> 01:23:35,841
<i># But where we're headed
we have never been #</i>

1263
01:23:35,851 --> 01:23:39,214
<i># Past the pavement
that we used to walk #</i>

1264
01:23:39,224 --> 01:23:44,308
<i># Past the people
that we used to know #</i>

1265
01:23:44,318 --> 01:23:46,852
<i># Oh, come on, go #</i>

1266
01:23:46,862 --> 01:23:50,392
<i># Past the people
that have broke our hearts #</i>

1267
01:23:50,402 --> 01:23:54,109
<i># We started laughing
at them from afar #</i>

1268
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:59,030
<i># But now we climbed
too high without a rope #</i>

1269
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,658
<i># Come on, go #</i>

1270
01:24:01,668 --> 01:24:07,664
<i># No, we are not swans #</i>

1271
01:24:07,674 --> 01:24:10,375
<i># Nor are we as ugly #</i>

1272
01:24:10,385 --> 01:24:15,046
<i># As we think we are #</i>

1273
01:24:15,056 --> 01:24:20,969
<i># We don't care for compliments
but please don't stop #</i>

1274
01:24:20,979 --> 01:24:23,305
<i># No, come on #</i>

1275
01:24:23,315 --> 01:24:25,260
<i># Come on #</i>

1276
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:27,726
<i># We are not swans # </i>

1277
01:24:27,736 --> 01:24:29,514
<i># We fit into each other # </i>

1278
01:24:29,524 --> 01:24:31,349
<i># We are Russian dolls # </i>

1279
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:35,984
<i># Where somewhere in the center
sits a beating heart #</i>

1280
01:24:35,994 --> 01:24:39,863
<i># But come on, come on #</i>

1281
01:24:39,873 --> 01:24:42,787
<i># We are not swans # </i>

1282
01:24:49,085 --> 01:24:50,702
Where's Michelle?

1283
01:24:50,712 --> 01:24:52,161
What, did you
change your mind?

1284
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:55,623
No, but I have something
I need to do right now.

1285
01:24:55,633 --> 01:24:59,841
And I love Michelle.

1286
01:24:59,851 --> 01:25:02,307
You love my niece?

1287
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:08,599
She's on the beach.

1288
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:10,685
Wait.

1289
01:25:10,695 --> 01:25:13,354
You take good care of her,

1290
01:25:13,364 --> 01:25:16,686
because I can still break
every bone in your body.

1291
01:25:16,696 --> 01:25:20,653
And we're opening
an L.A. office.

1292
01:25:20,663 --> 01:25:23,239
Go.

1293
01:25:23,249 --> 01:25:26,742
<i># Now do you feel
we've gone too far? #</i>

1294
01:25:26,752 --> 01:25:30,079
<i># Or do you fear
we reached the top? #</i>

1295
01:25:30,089 --> 01:25:35,042
<i># Or do you feel
like letting go? #</i>

1296
01:25:35,052 --> 01:25:38,212
<i># Well, come on, hold on #</i>

1297
01:25:38,222 --> 01:25:43,634
<i># We are not swans #</i>

1298
01:25:43,644 --> 01:25:47,096
<i># Nor are we as ugly... #</i>

1299
01:25:47,106 --> 01:25:49,181
Hey, Michelle!

1300
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:50,803
Ugh!

1301
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:54,770
What, you can't
say good-bye?
Ow! Ah!

1302
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:57,022
I thought you liked me.

1303
01:25:57,032 --> 01:25:58,435
I do!

1304
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:01,152
In fact, I--

1305
01:26:01,162 --> 01:26:06,699
I think I love you.

1306
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:08,654
Okay, then.

1307
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:13,289
<i># We have got each other,
I'd say that's enough #</i>

1308
01:26:13,299 --> 01:26:17,918
<i># So come on, come on #</i>

1309
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:20,384
<i># Come on #</i>

1310
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,894
<i># Mm, mm #</i>

1311
01:26:34,565 --> 01:26:37,479
<i># Oh, oh #</i>

1312
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:39,351
<i># Ooh, you said you don't #</i>

1313
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:45,028
<i># Put out your heart
just for me #</i>

1314
01:26:45,038 --> 01:26:46,942
<i># Yeah, you did, you know #</i>

1315
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:52,786
<i># Remember? Oh, yeah #</i>

1316
01:26:52,796 --> 01:26:56,790
<i># Finding out
what could have been #</i>

1317
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,210
<i># Is it just for free? #</i>

1318
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:03,714
<i># When suddenly,
it's in front of me #</i>

1319
01:27:03,724 --> 01:27:07,551
<i># It's all I need, you see #</i>

1320
01:27:07,561 --> 01:27:13,056
<i># I can't believe my eyes #</i>

1321
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:14,427
<i># Oh, my Lord #</i>

1322
01:27:14,437 --> 01:27:16,434
<i># I can't believe #</i>

1323
01:27:16,444 --> 01:27:20,272
<i># I can't believe my eyes #</i>

1324
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:24,943
<i># Woman #</i>

1325
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:27,450
<i># Oh, oh #</i>

1326
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:34,202
<i># Mm, mm #</i>

1327
01:27:34,212 --> 01:27:36,157
<i># Ooh, you know #</i>

1328
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:41,501
<i># I've never been
like this girl before #</i>

1329
01:27:41,511 --> 01:27:43,289
Rick, this is Carl.

1330
01:27:43,299 --> 01:27:45,458
I just wanted
to leave you a message.

1331
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:48,086
Your phone's
not working, for one.

1332
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,593
And second...

1333
01:27:50,603 --> 01:27:55,431
these questions were harder
than I thought they would be.

1334
01:27:55,441 --> 01:27:57,804
But I saved you a seat
in case you arrive late.

1335
01:27:57,814 --> 01:28:00,974
I mean, I don't know
if that does you any good,

1336
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:04,482
but uh...I just
want to tell you

1337
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:08,491
what a good friend
you've been, Rick.

1338
01:28:12,328 --> 01:28:15,118
I'm gonna call you back.
