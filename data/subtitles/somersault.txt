Hey, your dad told me
I should start charging you rent.

17
00:49:28,122 --> 00:49:30,882
Where have you been staying?
None of your fucking business.

18
00:49:30,882 --> 00:49:33,402
It's that Italian girl, isn't it?

19
00:49:33,402 --> 00:49:35,842
No.
I knew it was.

20
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:37,322
No, it's not, alright?

21
00:49:37,322 --> 00:49:39,202
Well, who, then?
You wouldn't know her.

22
00:49:39,202 --> 00:49:40,882
It's a big secret, is it?

23
00:49:43,202 --> 00:49:45,402
Well, I'll see you.
Yeah.

24
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:46,882
I fucking hate you.

25
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:51,282
You're just
jealous.

26
00:49:51,282 --> 00:49:52,682
It is that Italian girl.

27
00:49:54,082 --> 00:49:55,962

Here. Pete made you this.

31
00:50:08,082 --> 00:50:10,402
Does that mean I got the job?
Guess so.

32
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,522
Bianca,
how much are those doughnuts?

33
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:23,442
80 cents.

34
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,002
I might have one.

35
00:50:26,002 --> 00:50:28,482
You don't have to pay
for stuff like that.

36
00:50:28,482 --> 00:50:31,202
And you can have a drink
or chips or something.

37
00:50:31,202 --> 00:50:33,602
Can I have a doughnut?
Yeah, if you want.

38
00:50:40,522 --> 00:50:42,082
Mmm.

Hi.
So where's home?

47
00:51:35,922 --> 00:51:38,602
Um, I'm staying at the Siesta.

48
00:51:38,602 --> 00:51:40,442
Look what I got you, Karl.

00:51:40,442 --> 00:51:41,922
Ta.

50
00:51:43,522 --> 00:51:45,162
We've got a pony.

51
00:51:45,162 --> 00:51:48,162
What's his name?
Her name is Elsa.

52
00:51:48,162 --> 00:51:50,282
Must be expensive,
staying in a motel.

53
00:51:50,282 --> 00:51:52,282
Oh, no, I've got a flat.

54
00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:54,602
A flat?
Yeah, it's out the back.

55
00:51:54,602 --> 00:51:56,642
It used to be Irene's son's place.

56
00:51:56,642 --> 00:51:58,482
Did she tell you about him?

57
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:00,122
Nuh.

58
00:52:00,122 --> 00:52:02,602
He's in jail.

Well, he is.

60
00:52:06,242 --> 00:52:09,042
You can have a ride of Elsa
if you want.

61
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,722
Aren't I too big?

62
00:52:10,722 --> 00:52:12,722
You're alright.

63
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,682
Thanks for the lift.
Any time.

64
00:52:25,682 --> 00:52:27,082
See you, Bianca.

65
00:52:38,682 --> 00:52:40,082
Hi.

66
00:52:50,122 --> 00:52:52,602
Do you like being here?
Yeah.

67
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,842
With me?

68
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,442
Yeah. Otherwise
I'd be sitting here on my own.

69
00:53:01,562 --> 00:53:03,322
I like holding hands with you.

70
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:06,602
Yeah, I know.

71
00:53:06,602 --> 00:53:08,002
Do you like it?

72
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:13,162
I'm not a big hand-holder.

73
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:14,562
No.

74
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:19,802
What do you do if you like someone?

75
00:53:19,802 --> 00:53:21,762
I like to touch them, I suppose.

76
00:53:21,762 --> 00:53:23,922
Like what?

77
00:53:28,362 --> 00:53:30,242
(Giggles)
Like that. (Laughs)

78
00:53:32,122 --> 00:53:34,282
Yeah. What else?

79
00:53:37,242 --> 00:53:38,722
Like that.

80
00:53:41,682 --> 00:53:43,082
Is that all you do?

81
00:53:45,362 --> 00:53:47,962
No. That's just for starters.

82
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:51,842
What do you do?

83
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:53,602
Um...

84
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:56,882
I touch them.

85
00:53:56,882 --> 00:53:58,442
Yeah? Like how?

86
00:53:59,882 --> 00:54:01,602
Maybe on the hand.

87
00:54:01,602 --> 00:54:03,122
What else?

88
00:54:04,562 --> 00:54:06,122
I look at them.

00:54:08,762 --> 00:54:10,162
Show me.

91
00:54:11,402 --> 00:54:12,882
I can't.

92
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,282
Yeah, you can.

I found it on the path.

99

No, you've got to put it back.

100
00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:10,562
I'll get thrown out.
No, I ordered it.

101
00:55:26,202 --> 00:55:27,922

Um, at the BP.

01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:14,762
Go on, then.

198
01:04:30,962 --> 01:04:33,722
(Urinates)

199
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:44,522
Hi.

200
01:04:49,202 --> 01:04:51,522
Thought you might
like to have a drink.

201
01:04:51,522 --> 01:04:53,762
Did you?
Yeah.

202
01:04:53,762 --> 01:04:55,962
Look like you've had a good night.

203
01:04:57,722 --> 01:04:59,202
Yeah, it was great.

204
01:04:59,202 --> 01:05:00,682
It was a birthday.

205
01:05:04,922 --> 01:05:07,362
I don't know why I said it was great.

206
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:10,202
It was pretty bad, actually.
Better have a drink, then.

207
01:05:13,562 --> 01:05:17,002
When do you leave?
In about a week.

208
01:05:17,002 --> 01:05:18,842
Come back for the auction.

209
01:05:18,842 --> 01:05:21,202
Yeah, looks like you've been doing
some packing.

210
01:05:21,202 --> 01:05:23,402
Yeah, I had some friends down
to help.

211
01:05:25,562 --> 01:05:27,282
Should have got you round.

212
01:05:27,282 --> 01:05:29,442
I was only a phone call away, mate.

213
01:05:29,442 --> 01:05:31,122
Yeah, I'm sure.

214
01:05:32,682 --> 01:05:34,442
I helped you with that tractor.

215
01:05:34,442 --> 01:05:36,082
Yeah.
(Laughs) Yeah.

216
01:05:36,082 --> 01:05:37,562
You did.

217
01:05:37,562 --> 01:05:39,322
With Stuart.

218
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,442
Yeah.

219
01:05:47,002 --> 01:05:48,722
We just had a fight.

220
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:51,802
You and Stuart?
Yeah.

221
01:05:53,202 --> 01:05:56,922
Just a stupid fuckin' pussy argument.

222
01:05:56,922 --> 01:05:58,922
About?

223
01:06:00,882 --> 01:06:04,642
Oh, a girl that I know.
It's a... a friend.

224
01:06:04,642 --> 01:06:06,122
A friend?

225
01:06:06,122 --> 01:06:07,602
We're sleeping together,

226
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:10,882
but she's not like a close friend
or anything.

227
01:06:10,882 --> 01:06:13,562
Yeah, I've got friends like that.

228
01:06:13,562 --> 01:06:15,602
Yeah, it's nothing too heavy.

229
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,402
But you were arguing about her.

230
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:25,882
Yeah.

231
01:06:30,602 --> 01:06:32,762
You know, when you were a kid,

232
01:06:32,762 --> 01:06:35,842
did your mum ever used to spray
perfume in the air

233
01:06:35,842 --> 01:06:37,522
and sort of walk through it?

234
01:06:37,522 --> 01:06:39,442
Yeah, I think she did.

235
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:40,962
Yeah, well, she's like that.

236
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:43,562
Like perfume?

237
01:06:43,562 --> 01:06:45,322
No.

238
01:06:45,322 --> 01:06:49,402
See, when you leave,
you can still feel her on your skin.

239
01:06:52,562 --> 01:06:55,002
(Sighs) Fuck.

240
01:06:55,002 --> 01:06:56,802
(Thumps down glass)

241
01:06:56,802 --> 01:06:58,202
I'm full of shit.

242
01:07:03,762 --> 01:07:05,282
Have you got a boyfriend?

243
01:07:07,242 --> 01:07:08,642
Yes.

244
01:07:14,522 --> 01:07:17,202
Would you like me to give you
a lift home?

245
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:23,202
No, I'm alright.

246
01:07:25,122 --> 01:07:26,722
You're too pissed to drive.

247
01:07:43,122 --> 01:07:46,722
If you're looking for the bathroom,
it's down the hallway on the right.

248
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:01,962
Um... got you a blanket.

249
01:08:01,962 --> 01:08:03,602
I don't want a blanket.

250
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,482
I don't think you know
what you want.

251
01:08:19,882 --> 01:08:22,802

01:08:55,962 --> 01:08:58,402
Hi, Dad.

255
01:08:58,402 --> 01:08:59,802
Morning.

256
01:09:03,562 --> 01:09:05,882
Some coffee in the pot
if you want it.

257
01:09:10,322 --> 01:09:12,522
I'm alright. Might have a shower.

258
01:09:13,962 --> 01:09:15,722
Probably a good idea.

259
01:09:17,922 --> 01:09:20,202
(Sobs)

260
01:09:23,082 --> 01:09:24,602
I'm drunk. (Laughs)

261
01:09:26,682 --> 01:09:28,282
Yeah, I can see that, Joe.

01:09:42,402 --> 01:09:43,802
Don't wake your mother.

264
01:10:04,922 --> 01:10:07,642
Good morning, miss.
Hello, Irene.

265
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:12,282
Did anyone call for me?

266
01:10:12,282 --> 01:10:13,882
No, love. No-one called.

267
01:10:15,802 --> 01:10:18,322
You expecting a call, are you?

268
01:10:18,322 --> 01:10:19,722
Sort of.

269
01:10:24,682 --> 01:10:26,082
Aren't you working today?

270
01:10:28,482 --> 01:10:30,042
No.

271
01:10:31,722 --> 01:10:33,562
Where'd you get
all that lovely hair?

272
01:10:34,642 --> 01:10:36,602
I don't know.

273
01:10:36,602 --> 01:10:38,002
My mum, maybe.

274
01:10:45,042 --> 01:10:47,282
See you.
See you, love.

275
01:10:50,242 --> 01:10:53,482
What about this one?

276
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:55,522
Angry.
Good boy.

277
01:10:55,522 --> 01:10:57,522
(Laughs)

278
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,322
What about this one?
Very sad.

279
01:11:02,322 --> 01:11:03,802
Good boy.

280
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:05,442
BIANCA: Hi, Mum.
Hi.

281
01:11:06,922 --> 01:11:09,522
Hello, there.
Hi.

282
01:11:09,522 --> 01:11:12,042
Do you want a drink?
Yes, please.

283
01:11:14,922 --> 01:11:17,242
Hi, Karl.

284
01:11:17,242 --> 01:11:20,442
Do you remember Heidi, Karl?
She came in the car with us.

285
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,842
Yep.

286
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:26,362
What about this one?
What do you think he's doing?

287
01:11:26,362 --> 01:11:29,442
He ate something
that didn't taste good.

288
01:11:29,442 --> 01:11:32,162
Maybe. What else could he be doing?

289
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:34,202
Growling.

290
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:38,842
What's Mummy doing?

291
01:11:38,842 --> 01:11:41,002
(Laughs)
Smiling.

292
01:11:41,002 --> 01:11:43,402
We're both smiling. (Laughs)

293
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:56,922
She's got lovely eyes.

294
01:11:56,922 --> 01:11:58,562
Yeah.

295
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:02,922
Does Karl ride her?

296
01:12:02,922 --> 01:12:05,762
Sometimes. He talks about her a lot.

297
01:12:05,762 --> 01:12:08,642
He's sort of obsessed
with his rabbits.

298
01:12:08,642 --> 01:12:12,322
He's got Asperger's.
What's that?

299
01:12:12,322 --> 01:12:15,042
Do you know what empathy is?
Kind of.

300
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:17,482
It's like if you feel pain,
I can understand,

301
01:12:17,482 --> 01:12:19,882
or if I'm happy, you can tell.

302
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:22,042
He can't tell,
so he can't make friends.

303
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:23,962
Oh, right.

304
01:12:23,962 --> 01:12:25,842
He just says
exactly what he's thinking.

305
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:29,482
He doesn't know how it's gonna make
the other person feel.

306
01:12:29,482 --> 01:12:30,922
What else does he do?

307
01:12:32,002 --> 01:12:35,522
Well, if you tell a joke,
he waits for everyone else to laugh

308
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:37,242
because he doesn't know
what's funny.

309

01:13:12,842 --> 01:13:14,442
(Playfully) Get out!

312
01:13:14,442 --> 01:13:15,922
(Laughs)

313
01:13:15,922 --> 01:13:18,162
This is Heidi, Roy.

314
01:13:18,162 --> 01:13:20,722
Hello, Heidi.

315
01:13:22,122 --> 01:13:23,722
Hello.

316
01:13:23,722 --> 01:13:25,402
Wanna stay for dinner, Heidi?

317
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:28,362
We've met before, haven't we?
You came in looking for work.

318
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,402
Yes.

319
01:13:30,402 --> 01:13:32,802
Mum, can you take us
to the video shop?

320
01:13:32,802 --> 01:13:34,282
After dinner, then,
eh?

321
01:13:34,282 --> 01:13:36,082
Hey, I think I might go.

322
01:13:36,082 --> 01:13:38,802
Why?
I'm just a bit tired.

323
01:13:38,802 --> 01:13:42,002
I'll give you a lift back.
I'm on my way to squash.

324
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,482
You'll be early.

325
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:55,922
So, where are we off to, then?

326
01:13:55,922 --> 01:13:58,402
Um, the Siesta.

327
01:13:58,402 --> 01:14:01,042
Ah. You're staying there, are you?

328
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,122
Yeah. I've got a flat.

329
01:14:06,682 --> 01:14:09,082
I didn't know Irene had flats.

330
01:14:09,082 --> 01:14:10,762
Just one.

331
01:14:12,562 --> 01:14:14,082
Nice, is it?

332
01:14:31,762 --> 01:14:33,442
Where are we going to?

333
01:14:35,282 --> 01:14:36,802
I want to show you something.

334
01:15:01,082 --> 01:15:02,722
Pretty, eh?

335
01:15:07,242 --> 01:15:10,202
And you are a very pretty girl,
Heidi.

336
01:15:12,082 --> 01:15:13,762
Thank you.

337
01:15:13,762 --> 01:15:15,242
(Laughs)

338
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,242
You know, when the Hydro-Electric
flooded the valley,

339
01:15:22,242 --> 01:15:24,922
they... they left the old town there.

340
01:15:24,922 --> 01:15:28,642
Yeah. All the houses and the roads
and the shops.

341
01:15:28,642 --> 01:15:32,362
They're all there, under the lake.

342
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:34,402
Town's under the water?

343
01:15:34,402 --> 01:15:36,682
Hard to imagine, isn't it?

344
01:15:36,682 --> 01:15:40,362
All of thatjust... sitting there,

345
01:15:40,362 --> 01:15:42,522
under the surface.

346
01:15:48,322 --> 01:15:52,322
You know, Bianca's had
a pretty rough trot of it

347
01:15:52,322 --> 01:15:53,722
moving down here.

348
01:15:57,642 --> 01:15:59,922
We moved from Queanbeyan.
Did she tell you?

349
01:16:02,882 --> 01:16:06,922
She's a very good girl.

350
01:16:06,922 --> 01:16:09,362
She's really nice.

351
01:16:09,362 --> 01:16:12,962
You know, she's basically got
her whole life in front of her.

352
01:16:14,962 --> 01:16:16,642
And her mum and I...

353
01:16:18,922 --> 01:16:22,842
...we don't want anything to...
mess that up.

354
01:16:24,242 --> 01:16:25,762
Do you know what I mean?

355
01:16:28,242 --> 01:16:29,842
Yes.

356
01:16:32,882 --> 01:16:37,482
I think it would be better
if you don't see her outside work.

357
01:16:39,042 --> 01:16:42,002
I just think
you're two different types of girls.

358
01:16:42,002 --> 01:16:43,722
(Weeps gently)

359
01:16:50,122 --> 01:16:51,922
You understand me?

360
01:16:58,682 --> 01:17:00,282
Yes.

361
01:18:09,562 --> 01:18:11,242
Hi.
Hi.

362
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:15,962
Want a hot chocolate?

363
01:18:15,962 --> 01:18:17,402
No, thanks.

364
01:18:24,922 --> 01:18:28,202
Pete told me to tell you
to stop eating so much stuff.

365
01:18:30,642 --> 01:18:32,402
I thought we were allowed.

366
01:18:32,402 --> 01:18:34,122
Yeah, we are.

367
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:37,642
Within reason.

368
01:18:37,642 --> 01:18:39,042
Within reason?

369
01:18:42,922 --> 01:18:44,322
OK.

370
01:18:51,122 --> 01:18:52,642
It was fun yesterday.

371
01:18:57,082 --> 01:18:59,402
What's the matter?

372
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:00,962
What do you reckon?

373
01:19:00,962 --> 01:19:02,922
I don't know.

374
01:19:04,722 --> 01:19:06,682
Roy told me what you did.

375
01:19:06,682 --> 01:19:09,162
What?
(Scoffs)

376
01:19:09,162 --> 01:19:11,922
What did he say I did?
I didn't do anything!

377
01:19:11,922 --> 01:19:13,522
What did he say?
You know!
