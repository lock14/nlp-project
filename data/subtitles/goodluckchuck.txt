1
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:54,201
All right, Kent!

2
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:56,507
Go, Hayley.

3
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:57,539
Seven minutes.

4
00:00:57,636 --> 00:00:59,294
Go get 'em, cowboy.

5
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:01,337
See you in seven minutes.

6
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,873
Stu, run it by me again.

7
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:08,472
Kissing is first base.

8
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:09,821
Second base is boob.

9
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:11,416
- Third base is-
- Finger.

10
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:13,855
- Finger?
- Or thumb.

11
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:15,065
Okay.

12
00:01:15,169 --> 00:01:17,405
Charlie, trust me.

13
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:19,870
Second base is what
it's all about.

14
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:21,429
I'm all about
the boobies.

15
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:23,422
Okay.
Anything else?

16
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:26,071
An intentional walk
is a kiss on the cheek.

17
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:28,312
An inside park home run
is a blow job.

18
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:29,623
What's a blow job?

19
00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:31,220
I have no idea,

20
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,667
but I overheard
my dad saying

21
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:34,520
that he gets one
once a year on his birthday.

22
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:36,409
So it must be good.

23
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:49,909
Yeah!

24
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,733
You, me.

25
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:52,946
Closet.

26
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,195
Seven minutes.

27
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:55,191
Heaven.

28
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:57,557
He's so gross.

29
00:02:00,152 --> 00:02:01,297
Sorry, Jennifer.

30
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:10,100
Stop.

31
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:11,412
Don't touch me.

32
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,003
Stand on that side
of the closet,

33
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,222
and I'll say we kissed.

34
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:17,195
I will... if you say
we did the nasty.

35
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:19,951
No.
I'll say we kissed.

36
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:22,091
Say I touched
your boobies.

37
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:25,043
No!
I'll say we kissed.

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,928
Okay.

39
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:28,652
I kissed your boobies.

40
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,004
Anisha!

41
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,552
Stop staring.
You're freaking me out.

42
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:03,270
I'm looking at you
'cause I like you, Charlie.

43
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:04,615
It's okay.

44
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,242
Come on. You can
do what you want.

45
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:09,030
That's okay.
I'm kind of new at this.

46
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,505
Let me see your penis.

47
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:13,890
What's the matter?
Don't you want me?

48
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:16,707
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:18,216
That's my boy.

50
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,387
He's probably
blow-jobbing her.

51
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:28,193
Anisha!
I can't breathe!

52
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:29,309
I love you, Charlie.

53
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:30,362
I've loved you
since the third grade.

54
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,062
Um... thank you?

55
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,759
So you like to play
hard to get.

56
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:35,650
Back off!

57
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,244
I've read
in my mom's Cosmo

58
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,553
this is supposed
to increase pleasure.

59
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,485
Don't worry.
This is my first time, too.

60
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:45,476
First time what, killing?

61
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:46,880
No, Charlie.
Making love.

62
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:50,401
Get off me, you freak!

63
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:58,459
Charlie Logan, you are not
my boyfriend anymore.

64
00:03:58,561 --> 00:03:59,673
I hex you!

65
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:00,889
You what?

66
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:04,189
I hex you.
You will never be happy.

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,512
Around you love will fall
like rain.

68
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:10,462
But you won't hold it.
Your heart will pain!

69
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,315
Once the girl
has been with you,

70
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:14,618
to the next she will be true!

71
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:17,814
Was that Phil Collins?

72
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,134
What happened?

73
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:27,985
Did you thumb her?

74
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,990
Charlie, we could get arrested
for public indecency.

75
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:45,648
I like the way you think.

76
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,929
Okay.

77
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:14,829
All right!

78
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,158
Oh, my-
Oh, my God, Carol.

79
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,354
I love you.

80
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,590
I love you!

81
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,598
Thank you.

82
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:28,231
I love you, Charlie.

83
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:29,284
Oh, that's nice.

84
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:32,940
"That's nice"?

85
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,828
I'm licking the sand
off your balls,

86
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:36,040
and you say,
"That's nice"?

87
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,150
No, I said,
"Oh, my God" to that.

88
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,450
I said, "Oh, my God"
very enthusiastically about the ball lick.

89
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,917
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.

90
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:46,730
I just don't think the "L" word
should be thrown around casually.

91
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,314
The "L" word?
What are you, eight?

92
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:53,378
How about the "F" word
and the "you" word?

93
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,272
I can't believe
you and Carol went belly-up, man.

94
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,488
She was so into you.

95
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,340
Yeah, well, she was
a, uh, noisy eater.

96
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:22,338
It's that word, Stu: love.

97
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:24,738
I wanted to say it,
but I just- I couldn't.

98
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:27,138
How can I say something
if I don't feel it?

99
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:29,025
Easy. Lie.

100
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:31,425
What do you think
all relationships are based on, man?

101
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:32,538
Lies.

102
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,064
"No, honey, your ass
looks great in those jeans. "

103
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:37,625
"Honey,
I love your parents. "

104
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,031
"You're kidding me. That sore right there?
That's not herpes. "

105
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,242
You know what I'm saying?

106
00:06:41,346 --> 00:06:43,418
So, then, who are you
taking to Katie's wedding?

107
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:45,343
Oh, I don't know.
You want to go?

108
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,934
Do bridesmaids give head
in the coat room?

109
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,942
Of course I want to go!

110
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:52,601
You know how easy it is
to score at a wedding?

111
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,005
Have you ever scored
at a wedding?

112
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:56,859
Pacing myself.

113
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,453
Must be weird.

114
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:00,151
You were dating Katie
six months ago,

115
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,596
and now she's
marrying a doctor.

116
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:03,253
I'm a doctor.

117
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:05,331
He's a heart surgeon.
You're a dentist.

118
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:07,259
It's like saying
General Patton and Colonel Mustard

119
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:08,665
are both military men.

120
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:10,586
Hi, Dr. Stu.

121
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:11,611
Natalie.

122
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,444
I jerk off
to her mammograms.

123
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,485
God, I love my job.

124
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:23,992
Every day is like Christmas.

125
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,748
Who are you
working over today?

126
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:31,952
Dr. Charlie,
you're five minutes late!

127
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:33,649
You've got four fillings,
three cleanings,

128
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,060
two crowns, and a canal.

129
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,502
You've got too many patients,

130
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,290
and I've got too little patience

131
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,733
for you to be gabbing gossip

132
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,586
with Dr. Boob Jobs in the hallway.

133
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,180
How are you today, Reba?

134
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:45,075
Were you just
looking at my tits?

135
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,580
Because I am more than happy

136
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:48,270
with what the Lord Almighty gave me.

137
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:49,900
I wasn't looking at your-

138
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:52,371
Come on, Dr. Charlie.

139
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:05,447
I don't want anybody else

140
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:09,382
When I think about you,
I rub myself

141
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,612
I don't want
anybody else

142
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:17,573
When I think about you,
I touch myself

143
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:19,910
You are what-

144
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,159
Okay, you're my wingman.

145
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:22,855
If the blonde asks,

146
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,226
I'm the billionaire
who invented string cheese.

147
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:26,438
If it's that redhead,

148
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,363
tell her I wrote
"We Are the World. "

149
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:30,533
And, uh, if it's
that cheerleader hottie over there,

150
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,708
my penis is in
the Guinness Book of World Records:

151
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:33,989
girth, not length.

152
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:35,433
I want it to sound believable.

153
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:36,992
Holy shit.

154
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:41,830
Activate pelvis.

155
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:54,823
Yo, yo, yo, hold on
to your pantyhose.

156
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,407
The hostess
with the mostest

157
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:58,917
has got a toastess.

158
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:07,554
I just want to thank everybody

159
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:09,629
for coming to share
this day with us.

160
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,588
I couldn't imagine
being any happier

161
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,027
than I am right now.

162
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,012
Wait till tonight, sweetheart.

163
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,915
I know it's
a little unorthodox,

164
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,801
but I'd also like
to propose a toast...

165
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:24,217
to Charlie Logan.

166
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:29,112
Thank you, Charlie,
for being my lucky charm.

167
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:30,112
To Charlie!

168
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:32,119
- To Charlie.
- To Charlie.

169
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:39,255
So, you're that Charlie?

170
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,537
What Charlie?

171
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,836
You know, Charlie,
the- the dentist.

172
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:10,288
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:11,822
- Oh, no. Are you okay?
- That's horrible.

174
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,936
- I'm all right.
- I didn't- I didn't mean to.

175
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,179
Sorry about that.

176
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,490
Oh, jeez.

177
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:18,933
Here you go.

178
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,242
- Thanks.
- Sure.

179
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:21,904
Oh. There I am.

180
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:24,790
Join us.

181
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:28,461
So, what did I miss?

182
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:29,743
Not much.

183
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,569
Same old-
I do, I do.

184
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:32,879
"You may
kiss the bride. "

185
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:34,836
White cake
with raspberry filling,

186
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,558
and the doves
being released,

187
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,115
but the doves
refuse to leave.

188
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:43,499
I'm Cam. I went
to college with the bride.

189
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,741
I'm Charlie.
I used to date the bride.

190
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:46,824
Me, too.

191
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,856
Well, no. I mean,
it was a one-time-only

192
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:52,304
experimental thing,
sophomore year.

193
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,736
We were young.
And drunk.

194
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:03,433
Is this person
being dipped in acid?

195
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:07,081
Waiter, could we
have some chloroform for the singer?

196
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:08,743
What are you going to sing?

197
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:10,821
I'm thinking about
doing Bon Jovi "Livin' On a Prayer. "

198
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:12,355
Really?
That's the one I was going to do.

199
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:13,738
- Oh, really?
- No.

200
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:18,827
So, Cam, what do you do?

201
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:21,258
I run the Penguin Habitat
at Aqua World.

202
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:24,001
Seriously, what do you do?

203
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,209
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:27,209
I'm a serial killer.

205
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:29,379
My passion is killing people
I meet at weddings.

206
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:30,344
What do you do?

207
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:32,831
FBl.
You're under arrest.

208
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:34,793
Your run is over,
Miss "Wexler,"

209
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,060
if that's your real name.

210
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:40,456
Actually, I am a dentist.

211
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:41,730
You're a dentist?

212
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:44,068
You'll love me.
Perfect teeth. No cavities.

213
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,411
Want to see?

214
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,998
Oh, my! My legs!

215
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:49,924
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:51,069
Water!

217
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:53,662
Oh, no!

218
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:54,910
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:58,144
I'll just get in there and-

220
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:00,444
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

221
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:02,141
Wait.
Let me see, let me see.

222
00:12:02,244 --> 00:12:05,277
- Thanks.
- It looks like cum!

223
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:07,458
Well, here I am.

224
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:08,983
What are your other two wishes?

225
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,574
Stu, Cam.
Cam, Stu.

226
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:13,535
- Hi.
- Hi.

227
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,967
It's actually Doctor Stu.

228
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,439
I'm a reconstructive
surgeon.

229
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,122
If anyone has an accident
or is born with a deformity,

230
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:21,599
I'm there to help.

231
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:23,800
And by deformity,
he means small breasts.

232
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,718
He's just jealous

233
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,887
because he has to clean
plaque all day long

234
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,714
while I'm out
making the world a better place.

235
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,331
Cam, you will not
believe this doofus

236
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,217
that just tried to pick me up.

237
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:37,593
Oh. Hi.

238
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:38,554
Hi.

239
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:39,766
- Again.
- Yeah.

240
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,211
Yeah.

241
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:43,382
I got to go.

242
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:44,978
Nice to meet you.

243
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:47,220
Tits and teeth.

244
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:53,081
I don't think
she was into me.

245
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:55,382
Say, uh, ladies-

246
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:58,385
Hey, you.

247
00:12:58,489 --> 00:12:59,896
Hey.

248
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:01,487
- You look great.
- Thank you.

249
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:03,055
So do you.

250
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:05,364
So, how are you and Carol doing?

251
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,534
We're-

252
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:13,108
We're just giving each other
a little space right now.

253
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:15,378
I worry about you
sometimes, Chuck.

254
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:17,998
Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

255
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:19,694
It's better
to have loved and lost

256
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:21,487
than to have never
loved at all.

257
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:25,582
I'll buy that when you can honestly
tell me that you have loved.

258
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:26,829
<i>Touché.</i>

259
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,738
I just want to see you
happy, Chuckles.

260
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,984
Attention, hot mamas.

261
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:36,716
Can we have all
the single ladies

262
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:39,435
out on the terrace
for the tossing of the bride's bouquet?

263
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:40,683
See you.

264
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,414
Ready, ladies?

265
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,039
One!

266
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:54,247
Two!

267
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,811
Three!

268
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:15,815
Morning, Reba.

269
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:17,407
Good morning, Dr. Logan.

270
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:21,254
Good morning, Doctor.

271
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:23,208
I think I have a cavity.

272
00:14:23,304 --> 00:14:24,646
Me, too.

273
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,088
- Hey, Sharon. Is Stu in?
- Hi.

274
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:02,528
Sharon-
Oh, Dr. Logan.

275
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:04,665
Can you come back here
for a second, please?

276
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:12,346
Oh, I'm sorry.

277
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:14,519
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We need you.

278
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,379
Dr. Logan-

279
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,477
This is Pleasure.

280
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:20,694
Nice to meet you.

281
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,554
The pleasure's all mine.

282
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:24,180
Get it?

283
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:25,910
"The pleasure's all mine"?

284
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:27,900
My name is Pleasure.

285
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:32,469
That is... enormously clever.

286
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,313
We need
a second opinion.

287
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:37,623
What do you think?

288
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:40,024
Are they even?

289
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:41,170
So you knew they were even.

290
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,550
Of course they were even. I did them.

291
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,893
I just wanted you to see them

292
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:45,651
without having to pay
for a lap dance.

293
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:47,662
How did you get a license
to practice medicine?

294
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:48,978
You need a license?

295
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,592
Listen, have you noticed
anything different about me?

296
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:55,957
Other than your aversion
to fantastic, gigantic titties?

297
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,672
Women seem to be
coming on to me

298
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:00,596
in an unusual manner.

299
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,100
Really?

300
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,307
That's crazy.

301
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:15,371
Charlie! Stuart.

302
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,621
Carol.

303
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:18,992
Are these back
in season again?

304
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:22,064
You're getting married.

305
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:24,398
What can I say?

306
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:26,472
I guess you are
a lucky charm.

307
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,028
You have 14 new messages.

308
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,181
Message 1.

309
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:48,325
Hey, Charlie.
My name's Nicole Adams.

310
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:49,509
You don't know me,

311
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:51,468
but I got your number
from Amy in Radiology.

312
00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:53,451
I was wondering
if we could meet up

313
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:54,660
for drinks
one of these nights.

314
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,250
Hi, Charlie.
My name's Julia.

315
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:59,973
I normally don't do this, but I'm desperate.
Could you-

316
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:02,496
I'm not sure how you
choose your dates,

317
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:03,879
but I'm 5'10", blonde-

318
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,407
Hello, Charlie.
My name is Daisy.

319
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:07,913
Uh, actually in town-

320
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:10,179
Hi. My name is Bob.

321
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:12,103
No, it's not a wrong number.
Hear me out.

322
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:14,054
Hi. This is Cindy.

323
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:15,264
I'm a friend of Katie's-

324
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,189
Hey, my name's Colleen-

325
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,621
Hey, there.
We met at the gym.

326
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:20,667
StairMaster buddies?

327
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:27,074
Eat up, Shadow.

328
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,693
Last chance before bedtime.

329
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:31,738
Good boy.

330
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,233
Grumpy, don't be a pig.

331
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,569
Don't be a pig.
That's Chester's.

332
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:38,977
There you go.

333
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,279
Good boy.

334
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:43,549
Here, Dougie.
Gobble it up.

335
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,425
Come here, Tina.

336
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,765
Grumpy,
you're such a pig.

337
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:51,740
Joe, hurry up!

338
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,367
I want to go home.

339
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,649
Did you get lost
back there?

340
00:17:58,751 --> 00:17:59,798
Sorry.

341
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:01,179
Just taking five...

342
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,087
hits from my bong.

343
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,558
If they catch you with weed,
you're going to get fired.

344
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:08,083
They don't care
that you're my brother.

345
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,531
Oh, take a chillaxitive.

346
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,051
How is anybody
going to know?

347
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,710
Maybe 'cause you smell like you've been
bathing in bong water.

348
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:17,266
Sweet.

349
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:18,420
What's that in your pocket?

350
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:24,115
Oh, I was looking for this.

351
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:25,625
Three months.

352
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:27,413
Hey, Skully.

353
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:34,991
Joe!
Joe, I'm slipping!

354
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:43,343
And you think I look wasted.

355
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,802
Grumpy, no!

356
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:02,866
You okay?

357
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,350
I think I chipped a tooth.

358
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:09,000
It's great to finally meet you.

359
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,088
Let me get that for you.

360
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:11,600
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

361
00:19:13,937 --> 00:19:15,311
- All right?
- Yeah.

362
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:21,928
All right.

363
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:22,893
Are you ready?

364
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:24,365
Yeah, let's go.

365
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:31,050
Don't you want to, uh-

366
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:32,229
What?

367
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,591
I don't know,
have dinner first?

368
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,448
Is that how this works?

369
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,588
How what works?

370
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:40,619
The thing.

371
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:42,242
The thing. The magic.

372
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,427
The charm.

373
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:46,788
Wait a second.

374
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:50,303
Gretel, what the hell
are you talking about?

375
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,482
You're a lucky charm.
You have sex with someone,

376
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:54,277
and then they find
their true love.

377
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:55,490
Isn't that how it works?

378
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:56,705
Has everybody
lost their minds?

379
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:57,791
That's ridiculous.
That's absurd.

380
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,231
Do you want top
or bottom?

381
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,151
Put that back
in your secret booby place.

382
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:04,190
That's- No.

383
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:06,303
I don't want to take
advantage of you.

384
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:12,033
Look, don't take this
so seriously.

385
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:13,214
I'm certainly not.

386
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:14,943
I'm doing this on a lark.

387
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:17,412
And you won't be
taking advantage of me.

388
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,356
Do you know how many
loser boyfriends I have had?

389
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,940
Do you know how many times
I have given myself-

390
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:24,538
body, mind, soul-

391
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:26,716
hoping that this was it,
this was the one,

392
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:31,193
only to find out he was
just another asshole?

393
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,054
Look, if there's a chance-

394
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:37,943
I mean even a. 0001 %%% chance
that you're the key,

395
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:41,660
that being with you could
open the door to something better,

396
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,428
well, I think I'd be
taking advantage of you.

397
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:51,356
Do you want to have sex
before or after dinner?

398
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:53,789
Actually, I have dinner plans.

399
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:58,235
I got to get that.
It's my emergency line.

400
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,154
Oh. Emergency.
Now, that's sexy.

401
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,332
Dr. Logan speaking.

402
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:03,411
Hey, it's Cam Wexler.

403
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:05,403
Remember,
from the wedding?

404
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,354
The serial killer?

405
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:12,687
Yeah. Yeah, hi.

406
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:13,971
I'm sorry to bother you,

407
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,529
but I have a bit
of a dental emergency.

408
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:18,455
You don't have to make up stories, Cam.

409
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:21,586
If you want to see me,
all you have to do is ask.

410
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:23,248
No, seriously.
I chipped a tooth,

411
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:24,300
and it's Saturday night,

412
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:26,611
and I don't know
who else to call.

413
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:28,173
Oh, you chipped a tooth?
How?

414
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,166
I slipped while having
a fish fight,

415
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:31,407
slid down an ice ramp,

416
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:32,721
got tackled by a penguin,

417
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:35,026
and fell face-first
into a fake ice boulder.

418
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,100
This is very common.

419
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:38,798
Do you know
where my office is?

420
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,104
Yeah. I got your card
right here.

421
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:42,863
I can be there
in 20 minutes?

422
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:44,907
20 minutes.
I'm leaving now.

423
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,256
Okay.

424
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,493
Okay, all fixed.

425
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:01,902
Does that hurt?

426
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:05,356
Can you describe the penguin
that attacked you?

427
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,667
Very funny.

428
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:07,881
You can rinse.

429
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,358
So what really happened?

430
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:13,924
Did you get caught
in the middle

431
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:15,689
of some North Pole-
South Pole gang war?

432
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,830
There are no penguins
in the North Pole.

433
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:19,112
That's polar bears.

434
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,220
You really are
a penguin freak, aren't you?

435
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:22,787
Oh, you have no idea.

436
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:24,867
Obsessed is putting it mildly.

437
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:26,794
I believe you.

438
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:28,550
Oh, what's that?

439
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:31,880
Oh, I travel
to Guatemala every year

440
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:33,670
to help some
of the poorer villagers.

441
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,706
That's so sweet.

442
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,552
Sorry!

443
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:42,209
Oh! Oh, no!
They went in!

444
00:22:42,313 --> 00:22:43,174
They're in there!

445
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:44,483
- What's in there?
- The things!

446
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:46,046
Oh, here.

447
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,352
Oh, I'm sorry.

448
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:50,757
This is bad.

449
00:22:50,855 --> 00:22:51,870
- You're hurt.
- It's okay.

450
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:53,185
I'm so sorry.

451
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:54,628
Should have worn
that lead vest.

452
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:57,693
Oh, this always
happens to me.

453
00:22:57,798 --> 00:22:58,943
Are you okay?

454
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,158
Yes.
Yeah, I'm fine.

455
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:01,538
- You sure?
- I feel good.

456
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:05,249
Man. I hope you let me
buy you a new shirt.

457
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,966
No. No, really.
It's, uh, it's good.

458
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:10,620
But I hope you'll let me
take you out to dinner...

459
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:12,640
sometime.

460
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,910
Trust me, you can do
far more damage with a steak knife.

461
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:18,010
I'm sorry.
I- I can't.

462
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:20,185
How much do I owe you
for the tooth?

463
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:22,361
Wait a second.
So you will draw first blood,

464
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:25,246
but you won't
make it up to me?

465
00:23:25,344 --> 00:23:27,831
Please, how much?

466
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:28,884
No.

467
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,453
Your money's no good here.

468
00:23:31,296 --> 00:23:32,408
You sure?

469
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:33,784
I will not accept that.

470
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:35,829
Really?

471
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,797
Thank you.

472
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:37,844
Yes.

473
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:40,349
- I'm sorry.
- No.

474
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:44,315
See you in six months
for a routine stabbing.

475
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:46,866
- Bye.
- Bye.

476
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:03,092
Change your mind?

477
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:04,600
My car won't start.

478
00:24:05,497 --> 00:24:06,544
Sure it won't.

479
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:08,307
No, really.
I left my lights on.

480
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,592
Fine.
I'm pushing the car.

481
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:14,834
No, no, no, wait.
I want to jump you.

482
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:23,603
Now?

483
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:26,254
Not now.
Wait till I get this in here.

484
00:24:26,357 --> 00:24:27,404
Now?

485
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:32,013
Oh!

486
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:35,021
You okay?

487
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:36,138
Yep.

488
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:37,104
Let's-

489
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:38,283
I'm so sorry.

490
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:39,848
No, no. It's fine.
It's good.

491
00:24:39,954 --> 00:24:41,579
Cauterized my wounds.

492
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,009
Thank you.

493
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:47,657
Thank you for fixing my tooth

494
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:48,906
and jumping my car.

495
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:50,285
Don't mention it.

496
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:57,255
And thank you
for taking me home

497
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,268
to get my spare
set of keys.

498
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:08,201
I have a feeling
this kind of thing happens to you often.

499
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,823
My brother
calls me Murphy.

500
00:25:10,924 --> 00:25:11,785
Murphy?

501
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:13,672
You know,
like, Murphy's Law:

502
00:25:13,772 --> 00:25:15,495
anything that can
go wrong, will.

503
00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:16,805
Details.

504
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:18,532
Check out the thumb.

505
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,866
Holy crap!

506
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:22,912
What, did you get
pissed off at a stamp?

507
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:25,863
How many bones
have you broken?

508
00:25:25,962 --> 00:25:28,166
- 12.
- 12 bones?

509
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,753
I'm warning you,
keep a safe distance.

510
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:33,312
Come on. I can't believe
it's really that bad.

511
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,390
Is this the heat?

512
00:25:35,496 --> 00:25:36,423
No!

513
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:41,469
Convertible top.

514
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,549
Oops.

515
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:48,381
Keep the meter running.

516
00:25:48,486 --> 00:25:49,347
All right.

517
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:50,787
Oh, shit!

518
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:53,306
Shit! Shit! Shit!

519
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:54,689
Pardon my French.

520
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:57,854
I speak a little French,
and that sounded like "shit. "

521
00:25:57,955 --> 00:26:00,027
I left my house key
on the car ring-

522
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:01,341
You know what?
Doesn't matter.

523
00:26:18,432 --> 00:26:19,380
Got it!

524
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:28,082
- Sorry.
- You all right?

525
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,596
Yeah.

526
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:31,481
- Hope these are the right keys.
- Yeah.

527
00:26:44,922 --> 00:26:46,034
Thank you.

528
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,112
I'm sorry about the top,

529
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:50,518
and the, uh,
nerve damage in the back,

530
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:53,486
and the whole
electrocution thing, and-

531
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:56,210
I'd still like
to pay for the tooth.

532
00:26:56,312 --> 00:26:58,384
I told you.
Buy me dinner.

533
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:01,140
Lunch.

534
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:02,831
Vending machine.

535
00:27:02,935 --> 00:27:05,716
Drinks. Water.
I'm easy.

536
00:27:13,077 --> 00:27:14,321
I'm just...

537
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:16,909
not emotionally available
at this time.

538
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,419
I'm okay with that.

539
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:20,752
I'm looking for more of
a physical relationship anyway.

540
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,990
So I've heard.

541
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:25,229
I was kidding.

542
00:27:25,331 --> 00:27:27,851
That was a joke.
That was a stupid joke.

543
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:31,216
Okay. I- I get it.

544
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:32,524
So no way, then.

545
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:35,790
I'm sorry.

546
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:39,685
Good night, Dr. Logan.

547
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:48,940
Thank you.

548
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:51,110
I, uh...

549
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:53,002
Yeah.

550
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:33,821
Hi, Dr. Charlie.

551
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:35,965
Reba! What the hell
are you doing here?

552
00:28:36,068 --> 00:28:37,278
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

553
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,681
I used the key you left me
in case of emergencies.

554
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,820
What's the emergency?

555
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:44,443
I know about the charm.

556
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:46,370
Not you, too.

557
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:47,578
Somebody
posted about you

558
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:49,208
on perfectmatch. com

559
00:28:49,314 --> 00:28:50,874
It's an internet
dating site.

560
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:52,319
Yeah, I know what it is.

561
00:28:52,418 --> 00:28:53,530
This is out of control.

562
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:55,008
These stories
are just coincidence.

563
00:28:55,104 --> 00:28:56,381
That's what I thought.

564
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,198
But then I went
to urbanlegends. com,

565
00:28:59,297 --> 00:29:00,573
and nobody's disproved it.

566
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:03,355
Reba, I'll see you at work on Monday.
Good night.

567
00:29:03,456 --> 00:29:05,179
Dr. Logan, you've always
been there for me.

568
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,872
When you need a day off, yes.

569
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,568
When you need a lift home, yes.

570
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:10,493
When Reggie died
four years ago,

571
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:12,183
you sent that beautiful card.

572
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:13,627
Do you remember
what you wrote?

573
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:16,987
"If there's anything I can do,
please let me know. "

574
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:17,946
Yeah, but, uh-

575
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:20,411
Well, I'm letting
you know.

576
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:23,739
That's not
what I had in mind.

577
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:25,080
These panties are edible,

578
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,706
but I'd avoid the tush area

579
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:29,145
as I've been sitting
for about three hours.

580
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:30,836
Reba, I'm not the guy for you.

581
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:32,116
I'm not saying you are.

582
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:34,389
But the next guy might be.

583
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,951
Dr. Charlie, if we're together,

584
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:37,650
I know I'll find my soul mate.

585
00:29:37,753 --> 00:29:39,476
That- That's ridiculous.

586
00:29:41,752 --> 00:29:42,930
No.

587
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,723
No, Reba. Don't cry.
It's okay.

588
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:47,342
Come on, Dr. Charlie.

589
00:29:47,447 --> 00:29:49,334
You got to do this for me.
Please.

590
00:29:49,431 --> 00:29:50,292
- Reba!
- Charlie-

591
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:55,565
I can't do this.

592
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,164
Don't worry.

593
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,091
I'll do everything.

594
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:00,269
Please.

595
00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:02,827
Just close your eyes

596
00:30:02,932 --> 00:30:06,161
and imagine somebody beautiful.

597
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:19,277
I'll imagine you.

598
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,862
No one but you.

599
00:30:25,552 --> 00:30:26,413
Reba?

600
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:28,038
You slept with Reba?

601
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:29,387
Shut up.

602
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:30,348
You shut up.

603
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:32,072
What the hell's
the matter with you?

604
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:33,996
You're telling me
that you have the power

605
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:35,687
to turn any hot chick
out there-

606
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:36,999
any hot chick-

607
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:40,712
into a knob-gobbling,
lance-waxing flesh monger,

608
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:43,430
and you're out there
plowing the back 40 with Reba!

609
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:45,898
You don't know
because you weren't there.

610
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:47,403
Thank God I wasn't there.

611
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:49,508
It's disgusting.
It's revolting.

612
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:50,692
You're nasty.

613
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:51,810
How was she?

614
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:55,103
Dude, check it.

615
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:57,828
You see, that is
the kind of tail you should be chasing.

616
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,937
I could suck a fart
out of her ass

617
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,219
and hold it
like a bong hit.

618
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:08,550
Nice stop, kid.
Way to be.

619
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,813
Dude, these chicks,

620
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,983
they think that you're,
like, a lucky charm, man.

621
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,428
I mean,
you poke the poon,

622
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:18,014
she marries the next guy
she dates after you.

623
00:31:18,118 --> 00:31:19,328
It's not true.

624
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:20,574
Who cares if it's true?

625
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,172
Wake up, man.

626
00:31:22,277 --> 00:31:23,804
You got it made.

627
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:26,047
What is it
that all women want?

628
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:28,514
To get married,

629
00:31:28,612 --> 00:31:30,554
raise crib midgets,

630
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:32,186
and apparently, buddy,

631
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,560
you got the ticket
to the big show.

632
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,120
Do you know
what this means?

633
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:37,600
Trim.

634
00:31:37,698 --> 00:31:40,381
You're going to be seeing
trim like Tommy Lee,

635
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,823
like Colin Farrell,

636
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,928
like Ellen DeGeneres-
just-

637
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:48,694
Have you considered
the possibility the reason

638
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,261
you haven't been laid
in the last decade

639
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,822
has something to do with
your routine use of the word "trim"?

640
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:53,974
Yeah!

641
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,729
Seven days a week, 56 weeks a year, trim!

642
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:00,629
That's my bad.

643
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:02,970
Where's your manners, shithead?

644
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:04,476
What did you say to me?

645
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,507
Little help here, honey?

646
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:13,561
Look, you and I are different, okay?

647
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,481
Besides the fact
that I'm not retarded,

648
00:32:15,578 --> 00:32:17,269
I don't want
to take advantage.

649
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:18,483
- Dude.
- Yeah.

650
00:32:18,585 --> 00:32:20,952
Was Martin Luther King,
Jr. taking advantage

651
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,154
when he said that thing
in that place?

652
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:24,751
I don't think so.

653
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:28,718
Was Gandhi taking advantage
when he was doing his thing?

654
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:30,068
No.

655
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:31,989
And don't tell me
that Gandhi didn't score

656
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:33,875
some sweet-ass
Native American trim.

657
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:35,634
Gandhi was Indian.

658
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:37,644
They don't like
to be called that.

659
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,565
Dude, I thought
you wanted to feel love.

660
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:41,676
I do.

661
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:45,327
So stop dipping your foot in the pool
and dive the fuck in!

662
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:47,185
And think about this, man.

663
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:49,456
You'd be providing
a much-needed public service.

664
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:52,556
You'd be helping women find love.

665
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,936
Now, don't come bitching to me

666
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:55,377
you haven't found Miss Right yet

667
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,547
if you got women lining up
for the position

668
00:32:57,651 --> 00:32:59,822
and you're turning
your back on them.

669
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:04,168
Nice.

670
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,789
I guess.

671
00:33:07,888 --> 00:33:09,710
If I did it for the right reasons.

672
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:13,255
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, biznatch.

673
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:46,376
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa.
Don't take off my top.

674
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:48,415
Something wrong?

675
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:50,178
They're for the baby.

676
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,905
You have a baby?

677
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:54,724
No, but I will someday.

678
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:01,923
It's really good.

679
00:34:02,982 --> 00:34:03,909
Fuck me.

680
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:07,780
Fuck me harder.

681
00:34:09,732 --> 00:34:11,587
Oh.
Yeah.

682
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:12,993
Fuck me!

683
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,815
- Fuck me!
- I'm fucking!

684
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:17,533
Fuck me, you cocksucking,
cum-guzzling shithead!

685
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:18,747
Split my pussy in two!

686
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:20,956
You motherfucking asshole!

687
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,142
Is something wrong?

688
00:35:01,787 --> 00:35:03,129
Oh, God.

689
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,135
Oh, God!

690
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:10,127
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus Christ, almighty!

691
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:12,535
God, my savior!

692
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:16,756
I shall adore thee from now
until forever more!

693
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:19,125
Oh! Amen!

694
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:22,548
Would you like to
pray with me now?

695
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:25,613
Uh... no.

696
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:49,993
Yeah, I don't do that with men.

697
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,428
Oh, yeah.
That's it.

698
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:02,250
That's it!

699
00:36:02,351 --> 00:36:04,238
That's definitely it!

700
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:05,927
That'll be my wedding dress.

701
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,556
What do you think?

702
00:36:24,203 --> 00:36:26,057
Megan, I swear I know you
from some place.

703
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:29,668
We went to high school together.

704
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,363
Megan...

705
00:36:31,466 --> 00:36:33,092
What's your last name?

706
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:34,273
Gilles.

707
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:37,475
Gilles.
I knew a Matthew Gilles.

708
00:36:37,577 --> 00:36:39,878
God, you do look like him.
Is that your brother?

709
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:42,725
Actually, that was me
before the operation.

710
00:36:58,117 --> 00:36:59,360
Thanks.

711
00:37:02,116 --> 00:37:03,326
You're welcome.

712
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:08,542
- This just isn't working for me.
- Yeah, right.

713
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:10,429
You're just gonna give up
boning all these women?

714
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,471
These girls don't want
to be with me.

715
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:14,301
They want to be
with the next guy.

716
00:37:14,402 --> 00:37:17,500
So what? The road
to the next guy leads through you.

717
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,153
It's not that satisfying.

718
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,979
I'll tell you not satisfying.

719
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,698
Last night I masturbated
into a grapefruit.

720
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:27,800
I put it in the microwave.

721
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:29,527
I heated it up
a little bit, which helped,

722
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,491
but...

723
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,956
still.

724
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:43,417
You know, I read somewhere
that penguins like to eat their own shit.

725
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:56,086
You have 108 messages.

726
00:37:57,145 --> 00:37:58,967
Messages deleted.

727
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:15,028
The female lays a single egg

728
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,882
and rolls it onto
the feet of the male.

729
00:38:16,982 --> 00:38:19,534
The male stands
and incubates the egg

730
00:38:19,637 --> 00:38:22,484
until it hatches,
about 65 days.

731
00:38:22,581 --> 00:38:24,882
Having built up
a thick layer of fat

732
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:26,835
to sustain him
through the long winter,

733
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:29,484
he never leaves the egg
to hunt for food.

734
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:33,099
The female returns just
before the chick hatches.

735
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:38,730
If you have any questions,
please feel free to ask.

736
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:47,078
What are you doing here?

737
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:48,939
Are you telling me
that the male penguin

738
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,926
really lives off
his own fat for 65 days

739
00:38:51,023 --> 00:38:52,549
while he's protecting
the egg?

740
00:38:52,655 --> 00:38:54,596
You think that the female could bring him,
like, a mackerel burger?

741
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:58,182
Seriously, why are you here?

742
00:38:58,285 --> 00:38:59,627
Look, I don't buy the whole

743
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:01,830
"I'm not emotionally available" thing.

744
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:02,947
Are you dying?

745
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:04,394
Is that why you don't want
to get involved with me?

746
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:06,280
Because you don't wanna
hurt me when you die?

747
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,394
No, I'm not dying.

748
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,085
Well, I'm not dying either,
so what is it, then?

749
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:12,129
Am I not your type?
I can take it if it's that.

750
00:39:12,234 --> 00:39:14,754
I think you should go.

751
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:16,068
No, I think
I should stay,

752
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,820
because I paid $38.00
to see you today.

753
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:20,896
And I'm not leaving
until you pay me my money back.

754
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:22,277
Is this the dude?

755
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:24,132
- No. Joe!
- Have you been talking about me?

756
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:25,661
Why aren't you wearing your shirt?

757
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:27,109
- Has she been talking about me?
- Yeah.

758
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,353
- No!
- You're the dentist.

759
00:39:28,455 --> 00:39:30,277
I am the dude!

760
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,546
No, I mentioned you in passing.

761
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:34,053
I said you were funny.

762
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,710
- Oh.
- And you said he was-

763
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:38,682
And I said you were
charming and...

764
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:40,447
good-looking, and...

765
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:41,498
you have a nice smile.

766
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:43,579
Oh, I would not go out with me, either.

767
00:39:45,507 --> 00:39:48,027
Excuse me, miss?
How come the mommy penguin

768
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:50,400
doesn't bring back food
for the daddy penguin?

769
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,834
'Cause the daddy penguin
doesn't need any food, sweetie.

770
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:58,269
I have another question.

771
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,759
Why won't you go out with Charlie?

772
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,762
- She'd love to.
- Joe! You're my brother!

773
00:40:04,865 --> 00:40:06,752
Why are you taking his side?

774
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:08,790
Because I know
how long it's been-

775
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,610
Another word,
I hide your stash.

776
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:14,428
Go put a shirt on.

777
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,168
Look, how about this.

778
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,797
Why don't you eat,

779
00:40:19,902 --> 00:40:22,171
and I'll just digest my own lard.

780
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:25,558
Look...

781
00:40:25,661 --> 00:40:27,221
I just...

782
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,496
I know three women
you've gone out with.

783
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,603
I'm just not into dating
as a sport.

784
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,153
Wait, you said if anybody
had any questions-

785
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,160
- No! I'm not going out with you!
- That's not my question.

786
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:40,338
That was the little girl's question.
I have a new question.

787
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:42,546
What is that penguin
right there?

788
00:40:45,784 --> 00:40:48,086
That's a Gentoo,
one of several species

789
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:50,835
of penguin that is
completely monogamous.

790
00:40:50,935 --> 00:40:52,528
I hope that answers
your question.

791
00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:54,192
Oh, and penguins are unique

792
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:57,328
in that mate selection
is up to the female.

793
00:40:57,431 --> 00:40:59,535
Much like our relationship.

794
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:01,492
Why do you wanna take me
to dinner so badly?

795
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:02,734
You look hungry.

796
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,048
Seriously.

797
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:06,606
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

798
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:10,350
Because you remind me
of these penguins.

799
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:15,245
Yes, they're kind of
awkward and goofy.

800
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:19,501
Yet in the water,
they're so beautiful.

801
00:41:26,256 --> 00:41:27,565
Okay.

802
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:28,776
Okay, what?

803
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,767
- Okay, dinner.
- Will you put that in writing?

804
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,751
Don't push it.

805
00:41:32,848 --> 00:41:34,887
But only as friends...

806
00:41:34,991 --> 00:41:37,292
because if you must know,
there is someone else.

807
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:41,253
His name is Howard Blaine.

808
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:43,245
He is a foremost expert on penguins,

809
00:41:43,342 --> 00:41:46,059
and I'm meeting him
later this year at a conference.

810
00:41:46,157 --> 00:41:47,913
I'm interested in him.

811
00:41:48,013 --> 00:41:49,125
Well, I'm interested
in choreographing

812
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:51,683
a wacky line dance
that sweeps the nation,

813
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:54,210
but we both know
that's never gonna happen.

814
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:56,258
One date as friends.

815
00:41:56,363 --> 00:41:58,152
Fine.

816
00:41:58,251 --> 00:41:59,593
Bye.

817
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:02,656
I'm okay.
Just-

818
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:04,136
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

819
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:07,745
Bye.

820
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:26,628
So do sharks get cavities?

821
00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:27,838
No.

822
00:42:27,941 --> 00:42:29,697
- You have no idea, do you.
- I don't know.

823
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:33,151
I thought we were gonna
ask each other personal questions.

824
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:35,226
Isn't that the point
of 100 Questions?

825
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:36,542
Is that your question?

826
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:39,807
No, my question is...

827
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:42,208
Why penguins? Why?

828
00:42:42,307 --> 00:42:43,419
Why teeth?

829
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:44,569
Same as every other dentist.

830
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:45,688
Couldn't get
into med school.

831
00:42:45,794 --> 00:42:47,387
That's funny.

832
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:49,496
My parents didn't think so.

833
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:51,640
So really, why penguins?

834
00:42:51,745 --> 00:42:53,086
Couldn't get into shark school.

835
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,524
I don't know,
lots of reasons.

836
00:42:57,631 --> 00:42:59,867
For one, you can't help but smile
when you see a penguin.

837
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,315
Yeah, plus they have that bad-ass tuxedo
embedded in their flesh.

838
00:43:03,422 --> 00:43:04,600
I know! They're just so cute.

839
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:06,130
I just-
I just love 'em so much.

840
00:43:06,237 --> 00:43:08,823
I just love, love, love 'em!

841
00:43:08,925 --> 00:43:11,510
I even go to Antarctica
for research.

842
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:13,434
Oh, it's so beautiful there.

843
00:43:13,531 --> 00:43:16,182
You know they have
once-a-year sunsets?

844
00:43:16,283 --> 00:43:18,258
You haven't seen beauty
until you've seen that.

845
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:20,305
Oh, I don't know about that.

846
00:43:23,162 --> 00:43:26,031
And the penguin rituals
are just fascinating.

847
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,505
Okay now, by rituals,
do you mean, like,

848
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:30,008
eating their own poop?

849
00:43:30,105 --> 00:43:31,447
No.

850
00:43:31,545 --> 00:43:33,454
Like when a male
is sweet on a female,

851
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:34,935
he searches
the entire beach

852
00:43:35,033 --> 00:43:37,421
to find the perfect pebble
to present to her.

853
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:38,989
When he finally finds it,

854
00:43:39,095 --> 00:43:40,372
he waddles over

855
00:43:40,471 --> 00:43:43,188
and presents the stone
by placing it at her feet.

856
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:45,708
If she accepts,
they'll be life-long mates.

857
00:43:45,814 --> 00:43:47,439
It's kind of like
an engagement ring.

858
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,996
Yeah, it's unbelievable to watch.

859
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:55,916
I have a feeling

860
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,874
that you are
a very good kisser.

861
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:01,135
And I know this because I spent
an hour and a half inside your mouth,

862
00:44:01,235 --> 00:44:02,642
and I scoped it out.

863
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:04,942
What makes you think
I'll be kissing you, huh?

864
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,431
You all right?

865
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,526
You okay?

866
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:33,545
I guess I was wrong about
the "really good kisser" thing.

867
00:44:35,628 --> 00:44:37,035
Come on, we'll find
something you're good at.

868
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,180
What!

869
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,205
Perfectly imperfect?
What the hell does that mean?

870
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,484
I don't know.

871
00:44:44,587 --> 00:44:47,401
I mean, haven't you ever
fallen for someone's flaws?

872
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:48,806
I'm a plastic surgeon.

873
00:44:48,906 --> 00:44:51,775
I see a flaw,
I pour spackle over it.

874
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:53,572
Hey, are these new?

875
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:55,047
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, no!

876
00:44:55,144 --> 00:44:58,591
No, you don't touch these.

877
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,801
It's Pamela Anderson's
breast implants.

878
00:45:00,903 --> 00:45:02,845
Why are they not implanted
in her breasts?

879
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,503
It's a reduction, baby.
This is what came out.

880
00:45:05,606 --> 00:45:07,973
So you're hoping that
some sick dude will buy these?

881
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,338
Some sick dude already did.

882
00:45:10,437 --> 00:45:11,844
This dude!

883
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,396
What the hell do you want
Pamela Anderson's breast fillings for?

884
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:16,127
Why the hell do you want
Miss Penguin Pussy?

885
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,985
To each his own, buddy.

886
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:20,223
Oh, Miss Penguin Pussy.
Who the fuck are you?

887
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:22,975
Stu Klaminsky.
Nice to meet you.

888
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:26,141
Anyway, Cam's the one, man.

889
00:45:26,243 --> 00:45:28,577
When I'm with her,
I don't know, Stu.

890
00:45:28,674 --> 00:45:30,267
I mean, I feel like...

891
00:45:30,946 --> 00:45:32,604
She just-
She-

892
00:45:32,705 --> 00:45:33,883
Completes you.

893
00:45:33,985 --> 00:45:35,163
- Screw you.
- Screw you.

894
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:36,443
And can I just say

895
00:45:36,545 --> 00:45:38,300
that I'm an idiot
for listening to you?

896
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:39,328
Public service.

897
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:40,285
May I remind you

898
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:41,627
that you got
your axle greased

899
00:45:41,728 --> 00:45:42,972
a fair amount
in the process?

900
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:45,460
What's sex without love?

901
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,708
Sex!

902
00:45:47,807 --> 00:45:50,741
It's still sex!

903
00:45:50,846 --> 00:45:52,406
Jesus Christ.

904
00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:55,542
I never met a guy so bummed
to squirt a little baby gravy.

905
00:45:55,645 --> 00:45:56,757
Baby gravy?

906
00:45:56,861 --> 00:45:58,900
You know, man chowder.

907
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:04,276
Can't believe you're going
cold turkey for this chick.

908
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:06,135
If she wants me to be
more like a Gentoo,

909
00:46:06,235 --> 00:46:08,624
I'm going to be
like a Gentoo.

910
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:09,974
You lost me.

911
00:46:10,075 --> 00:46:12,496
Gentoo.
It's a monogamous penguin.

912
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:16,857
Who's ridiculed
by the other penguins

913
00:46:16,953 --> 00:46:19,157
for being a fag.

914
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:22,898
Here it comes!

915
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,757
You got some- right there.

916
00:46:32,854 --> 00:46:34,031
Thanks.

917
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:35,474
Do I have any on me?

918
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:36,434
No, no.

919
00:46:36,533 --> 00:46:37,777
You want to get that?

920
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,206
You're silly.

921
00:46:41,908 --> 00:46:43,697
I have something for you.

922
00:46:43,795 --> 00:46:44,744
Really?

923
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:47,217
A gift?

924
00:46:47,315 --> 00:46:48,777
Oh, bad form.

925
00:46:48,883 --> 00:46:50,224
A gift on the third date?

926
00:46:50,322 --> 00:46:51,532
Open it.

927
00:46:51,634 --> 00:46:52,975
Okay.

928
00:46:56,977 --> 00:46:58,951
You're an asshole.

929
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:00,965
Yes, but a thoughtful asshole.

930
00:47:01,072 --> 00:47:02,566
Thank you.

931
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:07,372
So, fess up about this charm.

932
00:47:08,432 --> 00:47:09,446
You heard about that.

933
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:11,917
Yeah. It's quite a scam
you got going.

934
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:13,444
- No, it's not me.
- Please.

935
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,630
It's not.
I'm serious.

936
00:47:14,735 --> 00:47:16,295
Somebody somewhere
got it into their head

937
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:17,958
that once a girl's
been with me,

938
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:19,141
she'll meet her true love

939
00:47:19,245 --> 00:47:21,001
with the next guy
she goes out with.

940
00:47:21,101 --> 00:47:22,083
Can you believe it?

941
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:23,530
Please.

942
00:47:23,629 --> 00:47:26,083
People will believe
whatever they want to believe.

943
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:40,927
Okay. I've got one for you.

944
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:42,494
Did you know
it is physically impossible

945
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:44,542
for a human being
to lick their own elbow?

946
00:47:44,649 --> 00:47:45,696
How do you know that?

947
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,749
No one can do it.

948
00:47:46,856 --> 00:47:48,416
All right.
I can do it.

949
00:47:52,902 --> 00:47:54,593
Can't do it, my friend.

950
00:47:54,695 --> 00:47:55,872
All right, fine.

951
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:57,021
I've got one.

952
00:47:57,126 --> 00:47:58,719
Did you know
that the average person

953
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:00,893
produces 10,000 gallons of saliva
in their lifetime?

954
00:48:00,997 --> 00:48:04,641
Did you know that I produce
10,000 gallons of saliva in one kiss?

955
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,722
That's disgusting.

956
00:48:05,828 --> 00:48:07,169
I'm going to show you.
Come here.

957
00:48:07,268 --> 00:48:08,609
I'm serious.
I'm serious about this.

958
00:48:08,707 --> 00:48:10,398
I don't like sloppy kisses.

959
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:42,807
Are you trying to unhook my bra?

960
00:48:42,908 --> 00:48:46,257
No. No.
I wouldn't do that. No.

961
00:48:46,364 --> 00:48:48,600
Why not?
Am I not your type?

962
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,609
You are definitely my type.

963
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:51,730
What's your type?

964
00:48:51,835 --> 00:48:54,291
Black and blue,
riddled with bandages.

965
00:48:55,707 --> 00:48:58,423
And braless.
Yeah. Definitely braless.

966
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:15,574
Your move.

967
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,157
That's it?

968
00:49:22,261 --> 00:49:23,723
Socks are next.
Slow down.

969
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:25,258
Wuss.

970
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:31,442
You really want to do this?

971
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,841
I mean, you really want
to take us further?

972
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,172
This is not happening.

973
00:49:51,663 --> 00:49:53,223
I got to get it.

974
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:55,149
It's- It's my emergency line.

975
00:49:55,247 --> 00:49:56,108
No. No.

976
00:49:56,206 --> 00:49:58,093
I got to get it.
I'll be back.

977
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,270
I'll be fast.

978
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,972
Dr. Logan speaking.

979
00:50:04,078 --> 00:50:05,703
Dude!

980
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:08,971
Is this an emergency?

981
00:50:09,068 --> 00:50:10,661
You're going to want
to hear this, man.

982
00:50:10,764 --> 00:50:13,665
Well, I am rather busy
right now.

983
00:50:13,772 --> 00:50:14,819
Good night!

984
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:16,679
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Did you bone her yet?

985
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:19,528
Look, unless
this is an emergency,

986
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:21,698
call my office
in the morning.

987
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:23,973
Fine. You want
to lose her forever,

988
00:50:24,073 --> 00:50:25,666
you hang up the phone
right now.

989
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:28,583
This is going to be
the best night of your life.

990
00:50:28,681 --> 00:50:30,207
Are you still there?

991
00:50:30,312 --> 00:50:33,573
Chuck. Are you there?

992
00:50:33,672 --> 00:50:34,915
What are you
talking about?

993
00:50:35,015 --> 00:50:37,218
Dude, it's that charm thing.

994
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:39,620
It turns out it's real!

995
00:50:39,718 --> 00:50:43,330
No. That's not true
because you told me yourself-

996
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:44,805
Uh-uh, but now I believe.

997
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:46,690
I started
calling all your exes.

998
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,066
They're married.

999
00:50:48,165 --> 00:50:49,627
Not just some. All.

1000
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:51,773
A to Z on your Palm Pilot, man.

1001
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:53,501
Susan Agrezzi
to Jeannie Zeigert.

1002
00:50:53,604 --> 00:50:55,840
Every single one
you closed the deal with.

1003
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,460
And did you see this month's
high school newsletter?

1004
00:50:58,563 --> 00:50:59,872
Sarah McDowell.

1005
00:50:59,971 --> 00:51:01,661
What, the girl
I lost my virginity to?

1006
00:51:01,763 --> 00:51:03,421
Did you see who she
wound up marrying?

1007
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:06,838
Tony Lamberto, that douche bag
she dumped you for!

1008
00:51:06,945 --> 00:51:09,814
You know what this means,
don't you?

1009
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:11,230
You shake the sheets with Cam,

1010
00:51:11,328 --> 00:51:13,400
she's going to marry
the next guy she dates.

1011
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:17,272
This- This-

1012
00:51:17,376 --> 00:51:18,619
I hate you.

1013
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,086
I really hate you!

1014
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,746
I got to go.
I got to go.

1015
00:51:26,845 --> 00:51:28,536
A dental emergency.

1016
00:51:28,637 --> 00:51:30,677
Freak accident.

1017
00:51:30,781 --> 00:51:33,235
Children, they thought
it was gumballs.

1018
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:34,747
Ball bearings,

1019
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:37,233
and it just fucked up
their shit.

1020
00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:40,537
You look great.
I had a good time.

1021
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:41,583
I got to go.

1022
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,537
I got to go!

1023
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:48,887
I can't believe you're
really considering doing this.

1024
00:51:48,985 --> 00:51:51,057
If you believe it
and everyone else believes it,

1025
00:51:51,161 --> 00:51:52,306
what else can I do?

1026
00:51:52,408 --> 00:51:53,423
Anything but this.

1027
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:54,575
I got to be sure.

1028
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,621
I've got to put the curse to the test.

1029
00:51:56,728 --> 00:51:58,516
Where is she?

1030
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,989
She's beached over there

1031
00:52:00,087 --> 00:52:03,315
by the giant garbage bag
full of doughnut holes.

1032
00:52:03,414 --> 00:52:05,519
Eleanor Skepple.

1033
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:09,266
She's angry, rude,
and she smells bad.

1034
00:52:09,365 --> 00:52:10,925
In addition to back acne,

1035
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:14,988
she's got front acne
and side acne.

1036
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:17,131
You see that glass of water there?

1037
00:52:17,236 --> 00:52:19,123
She keeps her teeth
in that glass.

1038
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:22,796
So you're saying
that she's single.

1039
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:24,208
She's your best bet, man.

1040
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:25,899
You sink the soldier all you want.

1041
00:52:26,002 --> 00:52:27,278
This chick ain't never
getting married.

1042
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,450
If she was the last woman
on the face of the earth,

1043
00:52:29,553 --> 00:52:32,401
humanity would come
to a screeching halt.

1044
00:52:49,262 --> 00:52:52,578
Hey, asshole,
got my peanut butter?

1045
00:52:52,685 --> 00:52:56,100
No. My name's Charlie.

1046
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:02,050
I'm sorry.
I was just wondering

1047
00:53:02,155 --> 00:53:05,122
if, um- if I could
take you out tonight.

1048
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:07,812
How does that-
How does that sound?

1049
00:53:10,826 --> 00:53:12,713
You want me to elaborate?

1050
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,631
No. I get your drift.

1051
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:16,256
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

1052
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:25,246
Pay you a hundred dollars
to go out with me tonight.

1053
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,216
$200.

1054
00:53:31,686 --> 00:53:32,765
Make me happy.

1055
00:53:40,803 --> 00:53:41,948
So a thousand dollars,

1056
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,571
and all you have to do
is take me to dinner?

1057
00:53:45,987 --> 00:53:48,441
Well, actually, I thought
that maybe we could,

1058
00:53:48,546 --> 00:53:51,480
you know, we-
you and I could, uh-

1059
00:53:56,896 --> 00:53:58,173
get physical.

1060
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,883
All right.

1061
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,877
I'm gonna fuck you
till you die!

1062
00:54:23,483 --> 00:54:25,076
And now we wait.

1063
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:32,790
Oh, Coco,
I know how you feel.

1064
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,777
We just put ourselves
out there,

1065
00:54:34,874 --> 00:54:35,953
and what happened?

1066
00:54:36,058 --> 00:54:37,650
I'm left hanging.

1067
00:54:37,753 --> 00:54:39,760
Huh, girl?

1068
00:54:42,425 --> 00:54:44,082
Has he called yet?

1069
00:54:44,184 --> 00:54:46,605
No, Joe, he hasn't.

1070
00:54:46,712 --> 00:54:50,323
Thanks for asking.
I really appreciate it.

1071
00:54:50,422 --> 00:54:52,756
God, I feel so stupid.

1072
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:55,090
Why did I act like that?

1073
00:54:56,406 --> 00:54:57,812
Why hasn't he called?

1074
00:54:57,909 --> 00:55:00,810
All this waiting
is driving me crazy.

1075
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:04,690
You know, there's always
some madness in love.

1076
00:55:04,788 --> 00:55:10,286
But there's also always
some reason in madness.

1077
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:13,259
Nietzsche.

1078
00:55:13,362 --> 00:55:15,303
Been using the pages
of this philosophy book

1079
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:16,457
for rolling paper.

1080
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:19,343
It's like I'm smoking
their thoughts.

1081
00:55:26,064 --> 00:55:27,012
It's him.

1082
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,941
Well, get it.

1083
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:30,565
I'm gonna let it ring.

1084
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:35,108
I'll screen it.

1085
00:55:35,214 --> 00:55:37,286
Sorry I haven't called,
but I've been really sick.

1086
00:55:38,573 --> 00:55:40,165
I can't even get out of bed.

1087
00:55:40,268 --> 00:55:42,853
Do you think maybe we could
just talk on the phone

1088
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:44,003
or on the computer?

1089
00:55:45,772 --> 00:55:47,594
I'd really, really like that.

1090
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:49,033
Call me.

1091
00:57:08,284 --> 00:57:09,658
I can't pretend
to be sick forever.

1092
00:57:09,755 --> 00:57:10,835
Come on, man.
You're my hero.

1093
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,849
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you gotta do this for me.

1094
00:57:12,955 --> 00:57:14,897
You got this, my brother.
You're a crazy train.

1095
00:57:15,002 --> 00:57:16,595
You're the man
in the mirror.

1096
00:57:16,698 --> 00:57:18,291
You're a force of nature.
Hurricane Stu.

1097
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:19,255
I can't do it.

1098
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,498
You have to do it.

1099
00:57:20,601 --> 00:57:21,942
No one's asked her out yet.

1100
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:24,430
Yeah, right. So I go out
with Eleanor Skepple

1101
00:57:24,536 --> 00:57:25,463
to test your curse,

1102
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,770
and what happens next?

1103
00:57:26,872 --> 00:57:28,464
I'm walking down the aisle
with Shamu!

1104
00:57:28,568 --> 00:57:29,582
I don't think so.

1105
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:31,345
Do you see what I'm doing here?

1106
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:33,873
The friend card, man?

1107
00:57:33,975 --> 00:57:34,869
Yeah.

1108
00:57:34,966 --> 00:57:35,948
That's mean.

1109
00:57:36,054 --> 00:57:37,995
You leave me no choice.

1110
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,315
Give me that,
you son of a bitch.

1111
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,980
If I marry her, Chuck,

1112
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:46,287
we're going to hunt you down
and eat you.

1113
00:58:00,114 --> 00:58:01,129
Yeah, Stu.

1114
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:07,088
I can't believe
you're still sick.

1115
00:58:07,185 --> 00:58:08,526
How long has it been?

1116
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:10,380
Two weeks. It's, uh...

1117
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,724
it's killing me,
but, you know,

1118
00:58:11,824 --> 00:58:13,100
I don't
want to infect you.

1119
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,272
At this point,
I wouldn't mind.

1120
00:58:17,295 --> 00:58:18,985
You know, I feel
like a kid again.

1121
00:58:19,087 --> 00:58:20,810
I haven't talked
on the phone this much

1122
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:22,154
since I was in high school.

1123
00:58:22,254 --> 00:58:23,498
That reminds me.

1124
00:58:23,597 --> 00:58:25,572
Would you go to the prom with me?

1125
00:58:26,861 --> 00:58:28,617
I love your voice.

1126
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:31,782
The crazy things is,
I can't picture you anymore.

1127
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:33,738
Okay, here's the update:

1128
00:58:33,836 --> 00:58:35,046
I am now 4' 3",

1129
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:38,529
I weigh 235 pounds,
and I've got a cleft eye.

1130
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,152
Can I ask you something?

1131
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,427
Yeah.

1132
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,766
Are you not into girls?

1133
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,055
No.
No.

1134
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:55,810
Are you... seriously, are you there?

1135
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:56,772
Yeah.

1136
00:58:56,871 --> 00:58:58,332
I'm not... not into girls.

1137
00:58:58,439 --> 00:59:00,227
You should have seen
my room growing up.

1138
00:59:00,326 --> 00:59:02,235
It was full of posters of... of girls!

1139
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:04,097
There was no guys.
It was girls!

1140
00:59:04,198 --> 00:59:07,263
Well, are you avoiding
actually seeing me?

1141
00:59:07,365 --> 00:59:10,659
No, Cam. I'm dying to see you.
It's killing me.

1142
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,690
Then come over.
Right now. Wash my back.

1143
00:59:13,796 --> 00:59:14,843
Come on.

1144
00:59:14,947 --> 00:59:17,019
I'll wear a mask.
You could wear a mask.

1145
00:59:17,123 --> 00:59:17,984
We'll play doctor.

1146
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:20,504
Ooh, boy. I want to,

1147
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:21,723
but with the-

1148
00:59:21,826 --> 00:59:23,353
No buts.
I need to see you.

1149
00:59:23,457 --> 00:59:25,431
I need to see if that
birthmark you have

1150
00:59:25,537 --> 00:59:26,617
really looks like Alfred Hitchcock.

1151
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:28,412
Now, wait. No. That-

1152
00:59:28,512 --> 00:59:30,584
That is a restricted area, okay?

1153
00:59:30,688 --> 00:59:31,931
Not everybody gets a peek

1154
00:59:32,032 --> 00:59:33,439
at the Master of Suspense,

1155
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:34,746
if you know
what I'm saying.

1156
00:59:34,847 --> 00:59:35,894
If I can't see you,

1157
00:59:35,999 --> 00:59:37,275
we should take
our phone relationship

1158
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:38,422
to the next level.

1159
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:40,695
What do you mean?

1160
00:59:43,198 --> 00:59:44,343
Oh, yeah.

1161
00:59:44,445 --> 00:59:46,104
That feels good.

1162
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:48,791
I like that.
Do you like that?

1163
00:59:48,894 --> 00:59:50,268
Like what?

1164
00:59:50,365 --> 00:59:51,609
That's my phone sex voice.

1165
00:59:51,709 --> 00:59:54,839
Come on, Charlie,
work with me here.

1166
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,722
I want to. I just don't
think that we should do that.

1167
00:59:57,819 --> 00:59:59,575
I mean, nothing to do with-

1168
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:00,754
Does your phone
receive pictures?

1169
01:00:00,859 --> 01:00:01,841
Yeah, why?

1170
01:00:01,946 --> 01:00:02,807
Sending.

1171
01:00:02,906 --> 01:00:04,018
Sending?

1172
01:00:04,122 --> 01:00:05,616
What are you sending to me?

1173
01:00:07,226 --> 01:00:08,087
Fuck!

1174
01:00:10,169 --> 01:00:11,249
- I got it.
- Got it?

1175
01:00:11,353 --> 01:00:12,846
I'm done for the night.
Thank you.

1176
01:00:13,913 --> 01:00:15,189
Oh, God.
Hold on one second.

1177
01:00:15,288 --> 01:00:16,215
Stu, what's up?

1178
01:00:17,688 --> 01:00:19,662
The deed is done.

1179
01:00:19,767 --> 01:00:21,807
I went out
with Eleanor Skepple.

1180
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,601
I'm not proposing to her,

1181
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,612
so you're in the clear.

1182
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:28,236
Are you there?

1183
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:29,902
Chuck?

1184
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:35,755
I feel better.

1185
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:24,227
Camcorder in the bedroom, huh?

1186
01:01:24,331 --> 01:01:25,258
Kinky.

1187
01:01:31,497 --> 01:01:33,831
So, for the, uh, camera,

1188
01:01:33,929 --> 01:01:36,417
do I have to sign a waiver
or something, you know,

1189
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,567
for internet purposes?

1190
01:01:37,673 --> 01:01:39,429
You really want
to talk right now?

1191
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,719
Whoa, those are nice.

1192
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,449
Oh, God bless you.

1193
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:47,364
You pushed me.

1194
01:01:47,463 --> 01:01:49,023
Sorry.
It's been a while.

1195
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:51,428
I can see I'm going
to have to wear protection.

1196
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:15,712
Stop staring at me.

1197
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:18,078
You're creeping me out.

1198
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:48,080
...no matter what your size.

1199
01:02:48,187 --> 01:02:49,648
You will not go to waste.

1200
01:02:49,754 --> 01:02:51,096
Sometimes it takes
a little love

1201
01:02:51,194 --> 01:02:53,527
to make someone want
to shed the pounds.

1202
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:55,185
Two main reasons-

1203
01:03:05,143 --> 01:03:06,604
What the hell?

1204
01:03:09,814 --> 01:03:10,796
Hello.

1205
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:13,203
"The deed is done"?
The deed is done!

1206
01:03:13,301 --> 01:03:14,348
I thought you said

1207
01:03:14,453 --> 01:03:15,795
you went out
with Eleanor Skepple.

1208
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:17,201
No, man. I just said that.

1209
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,827
What?

1210
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:20,273
I didn't want to risk it.

1211
01:03:20,372 --> 01:03:21,648
Marrying her?
Are you stupid?

1212
01:03:21,747 --> 01:03:22,859
But I saw you, man.

1213
01:03:22,963 --> 01:03:24,524
You asked her out.

1214
01:03:24,628 --> 01:03:26,537
No, man. I asked her
what time it was.

1215
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:28,236
She said it was 3:53.

1216
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:32,680
I can't believe
that I trusted you, Stu.

1217
01:03:32,786 --> 01:03:33,735
You fucked me!

1218
01:03:33,842 --> 01:03:34,987
Take out your friend card.

1219
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:36,616
What?

1220
01:03:36,722 --> 01:03:39,023
Take out your friend card now
and rip it up

1221
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:40,331
because you fucked me, Stu.

1222
01:03:40,432 --> 01:03:43,214
Oh, buddy, she's just a girl.

1223
01:03:43,312 --> 01:03:46,311
No. It's not a girl.

1224
01:03:49,071 --> 01:03:50,085
It's the girl.

1225
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:52,645
Now I'm going to lose her.

1226
01:03:55,918 --> 01:03:58,089
I'm not going to lose her.

1227
01:04:05,484 --> 01:04:07,426
Breakfast in bed.

1228
01:04:08,747 --> 01:04:12,576
Wake up! Good morning!
It's a beautiful day!

1229
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,089
Wow.

1230
01:04:14,186 --> 01:04:16,422
Am I supposed to eat
my way out of here?

1231
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:18,048
I walked into the supermarket.

1232
01:04:18,153 --> 01:04:20,357
I stood there. I was like,
"What does Cam want?"

1233
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:21,471
And I couldn't stop.

1234
01:04:21,576 --> 01:04:24,423
I was like, "She'll want that
and that and that," and I got it all.

1235
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,592
They didn't have Spam, though.
I talked to the manager.

1236
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,550
They won't have it in until next week.
Anyway, enjoy.

1237
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:30,240
Are you okay?

1238
01:04:30,342 --> 01:04:31,684
I am fantastic.
I feel like-

1239
01:04:31,782 --> 01:04:33,211
I did this-

1240
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,197
And then I gave myself
one of these. Look.

1241
01:04:35,301 --> 01:04:36,959
And I made out with myself.

1242
01:04:37,797 --> 01:04:39,074
You're acting kind of strange.

1243
01:04:39,173 --> 01:04:40,635
No. No, no.

1244
01:04:42,468 --> 01:04:44,355
Yeah, eat up. Eat up.
Try that. Try that.

1245
01:04:44,452 --> 01:04:45,597
Eat up.

1246
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:47,771
Hey, um, what are your plans

1247
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:49,303
for the rest of today?

1248
01:04:49,411 --> 01:04:51,777
I'm going to work.

1249
01:04:51,874 --> 01:04:53,467
I'm going to go
to work with you!

1250
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:54,748
I'm going to hang out.

1251
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,118
I got it all planned out.
I'm going to go.

1252
01:04:58,817 --> 01:05:00,726
I'm kidding.
I'm not going to work with you.

1253
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,010
Actually, Saturday.

1254
01:05:02,113 --> 01:05:03,356
What are you plans for Saturday- Sunday?

1255
01:05:03,456 --> 01:05:04,350
What are your plans
for Sunday?

1256
01:05:04,448 --> 01:05:05,625
Don't even answer that

1257
01:05:05,728 --> 01:05:07,102
because I'm already
thinking about Wednesday.

1258
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:08,279
What are you doing Wednesday?

1259
01:05:08,383 --> 01:05:09,943
Let's just seal it right now-
seal the deal-

1260
01:05:10,046 --> 01:05:11,475
and then I'll do my pineapple dance.

1261
01:05:11,582 --> 01:05:13,241
Yes, Wednesday?

1262
01:05:15,935 --> 01:05:18,356
This is your fault!
Everything!

1263
01:05:18,462 --> 01:05:21,778
You!

1264
01:05:22,909 --> 01:05:25,494
Jesus Christ, why me?

1265
01:05:25,597 --> 01:05:28,280
Just shut your lips, Stu.
Shut up!

1266
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:32,497
Hi, Cam. What's up?
It's Charlie.

1267
01:05:32,603 --> 01:05:33,618
How are you doing today?

1268
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:34,835
I just wanted to call

1269
01:05:34,939 --> 01:05:36,761
and make sure I had
the right number,

1270
01:05:36,859 --> 01:05:39,160
and I do, and I do.

1271
01:05:39,258 --> 01:05:40,337
How are you doing?

1272
01:05:40,442 --> 01:05:41,783
Having a good day at work?

1273
01:05:41,881 --> 01:05:44,117
Well, I'll let you get back,
but I wanted to remind you,

1274
01:05:44,217 --> 01:05:47,151
Wednesday night,
you and me, happily.

1275
01:05:47,256 --> 01:05:49,460
All right.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

1276
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:50,868
This is your fault!

1277
01:05:50,967 --> 01:05:52,308
His!

1278
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,484
You already ate.
Why are you-

1279
01:06:07,764 --> 01:06:10,414
Is there something different
in here since lunch?

1280
01:06:35,247 --> 01:06:37,515
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, banana

1281
01:06:37,614 --> 01:06:40,232
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, banana

1282
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,569
Got me lookin'
so crazy right now

1283
01:06:42,669 --> 01:06:45,418
Your love's got me
lookin' so crazy right now

1284
01:06:45,517 --> 01:06:47,905
Got me lookin'
so crazy right now

1285
01:06:48,012 --> 01:06:50,629
Your touch has got me
lookin' so crazy right now

1286
01:06:50,731 --> 01:06:53,283
Got me hopin'
you'd page me right now

1287
01:06:53,387 --> 01:06:56,289
Your kiss got me hopin'
you'd save me right now

1288
01:06:56,394 --> 01:06:58,782
Lookin' so crazy,
your love's got me lookin'

1289
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:03,298
Got me lookin' so crazy,
your love

1290
01:07:03,402 --> 01:07:05,027
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, got it.

1291
01:07:05,129 --> 01:07:07,234
Got me going,
so pay me right now

1292
01:07:09,097 --> 01:07:11,202
Raise the habitat.

1293
01:07:11,304 --> 01:07:13,311
Crazy, crazy, crazy

1294
01:07:13,415 --> 01:07:15,488
Crazy for you

1295
01:07:17,479 --> 01:07:18,427
Changed my mind.

1296
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,029
Took the day off
so I could hang.

1297
01:07:20,134 --> 01:07:21,312
I won't be in the way.

1298
01:07:21,414 --> 01:07:23,585
I know what you're thinking.
I'm going to be in the way.

1299
01:07:23,686 --> 01:07:26,435
But I think I'm going to blend in like this.
I think I'll blend. Look.

1300
01:07:26,533 --> 01:07:28,027
I know how to do that.

1301
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:31,329
Charlie, I'm working.

1302
01:07:36,707 --> 01:07:38,529
Or I could go.

1303
01:07:38,626 --> 01:07:39,968
Yeah, I-

1304
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:43,771
Get out of here.

1305
01:07:45,601 --> 01:07:46,648
No, no.

1306
01:07:46,753 --> 01:07:47,735
Thanks.

1307
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,460
Have a great day at work.

1308
01:07:58,463 --> 01:08:00,219
My car's this way.

1309
01:08:12,892 --> 01:08:14,004
Hi, Cam.

1310
01:08:21,946 --> 01:08:23,669
Work is done.
Time for fun.

1311
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:28,529
Hey.

1312
01:08:30,393 --> 01:08:31,887
Listen, I know
an amazing sushi place,

1313
01:08:31,992 --> 01:08:33,268
and the best part of all:

1314
01:08:33,368 --> 01:08:34,612
when you're finished
with your leftovers,

1315
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:36,816
they put them in a doggie bag-
or a penguin bag.

1316
01:08:36,919 --> 01:08:38,445
- Charlie-
- Oh, you don't like sushi.

1317
01:08:38,551 --> 01:08:40,045
Uh, Thai? Indian.

1318
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,997
Listen to me, you need
to leave me alone, okay?

1319
01:08:43,094 --> 01:08:44,337
I need some space.

1320
01:08:46,805 --> 01:08:48,015
So tonight is no good.

1321
01:08:48,117 --> 01:08:51,914
I'm very close
to changing my phone number.

1322
01:08:52,021 --> 01:08:53,776
Do you understand?

1323
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:11,751
If you were a hamburger
at McDonald's,

1324
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:14,126
I'd name you my
McBeautiful Tittie Sandwich

1325
01:09:14,225 --> 01:09:15,566
With Titties On Top.

1326
01:09:28,974 --> 01:09:30,631
- Can I see Stu?
- Just a sec-

1327
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:31,813
Yeah.

1328
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,568
Stu, I need you.
It's important.

1329
01:09:34,668 --> 01:09:36,773
I'm Dr. Charlie Logan.

1330
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:39,363
I don't know who this Stu
is you speak of.

1331
01:09:49,225 --> 01:09:50,086
Call me.

1332
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:51,167
I need your help.

1333
01:09:51,273 --> 01:09:53,094
Hey, are we still friends?

1334
01:09:53,192 --> 01:09:55,396
Cam is going to fall in love with
and get married

1335
01:09:55,496 --> 01:09:57,536
to the next guy she goes
on a date with, right?

1336
01:09:57,639 --> 01:09:59,646
I'm going to be that next guy.

1337
01:09:59,752 --> 01:10:01,213
Yeah.
You're a plastic surgeon.

1338
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:03,904
You're going to...
change my face up.

1339
01:10:04,006 --> 01:10:06,046
I don't care if you
give me a beak.

1340
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,972
I'm going to look
like a different guy.

1341
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,247
That way,
when I meet her-

1342
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:10,397
Hi. My name's Ronald-

1343
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:12,508
I'm the new guy
she falls in love with.

1344
01:10:12,613 --> 01:10:13,627
Let's go. Right now.

1345
01:10:13,733 --> 01:10:15,837
Don't look at me
in that tone of voice.

1346
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:18,306
I'm talking the truth.
Please?

1347
01:10:18,403 --> 01:10:20,290
Chuck...

1348
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,241
take a look around, man.

1349
01:10:22,338 --> 01:10:25,021
I mean, I can give you tits.
You want tits?

1350
01:10:25,122 --> 01:10:27,805
So you're
not going to help me.

1351
01:10:27,905 --> 01:10:31,200
Yes, but not by
rearranging your face, man.

1352
01:10:31,297 --> 01:10:32,889
Come here. Have a seat.

1353
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,422
There's got to be
a better way, right?

1354
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,269
I mean, I know
things are bad now,

1355
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:41,150
but things could be
a lot worse, right?

1356
01:10:41,248 --> 01:10:43,735
Listen, you could be
like my cousin, man.

1357
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,268
He found out last week

1358
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,098
he's got an inoperable
brain tumor.

1359
01:10:48,926 --> 01:10:49,787
That's horrible.

1360
01:10:49,886 --> 01:10:50,998
Yeah.

1361
01:10:51,102 --> 01:10:52,890
He's only got, like,
one week left to live.

1362
01:10:55,197 --> 01:10:56,375
That is...

1363
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,195
perfect.

1364
01:10:59,292 --> 01:11:01,431
That's perfect.
He's the perfect guy for her.

1365
01:11:01,532 --> 01:11:02,393
What?

1366
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:03,539
Yeah.
There's no harm, right?

1367
01:11:03,644 --> 01:11:05,269
He gets laid.
She falls in love.

1368
01:11:05,371 --> 01:11:06,451
He's dead within a week.

1369
01:11:06,555 --> 01:11:07,634
I swoop in, console her.

1370
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:08,786
Bing-bang-boom,
everybody's happy.

1371
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:09,872
Hey!

1372
01:11:09,978 --> 01:11:12,563
Why don't you club her
and have a wedding ceremony

1373
01:11:12,665 --> 01:11:13,429
while she's knocked unconscious?

1374
01:11:13,529 --> 01:11:14,739
That'd work!

1375
01:11:16,377 --> 01:11:18,515
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1376
01:11:18,616 --> 01:11:22,030
You have to let her go.

1377
01:11:22,136 --> 01:11:25,364
That's the one thing
I can't do.

1378
01:11:55,409 --> 01:11:57,296
- Next time I'll bring my suit.
- Yeah.

1379
01:11:57,393 --> 01:11:58,669
Oh, no.

1380
01:11:58,769 --> 01:12:00,459
Oh, no. That's not good.

1381
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:06,694
No.

1382
01:12:06,799 --> 01:12:08,871
It's over.

1383
01:12:08,975 --> 01:12:10,251
That has to be George.

1384
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:12,291
George.

1385
01:12:14,605 --> 01:12:16,165
Hey, George!

1386
01:12:16,269 --> 01:12:17,762
- What's up, George?
- What?

1387
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:19,145
- How you doing, George?
- I'm not George.

1388
01:12:19,244 --> 01:12:20,618
You're going to stay
away from Cam, all right?

1389
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:23,715
You're going to stay away
from Cam, you hear me?

1390
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:26,339
- You're George!
- Charlie!

1391
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:27,851
- I'm not George!
- Cam!

1392
01:12:27,947 --> 01:12:29,060
What are you doing?

1393
01:12:29,163 --> 01:12:30,985
I just met George.
He's a real jerk.

1394
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:32,424
You shouldn't like him.
I want to see you.

1395
01:12:32,522 --> 01:12:34,911
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

1396
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:35,945
No!

1397
01:12:36,617 --> 01:12:38,919
Falling.

1398
01:12:40,552 --> 01:12:41,762
What is wrong with you?

1399
01:12:45,959 --> 01:12:47,006
I'm being bitten!

1400
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:49,217
Does he have fish
in his pants?

1401
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:57,277
Oh, those fuckers
are vicious.

1402
01:12:57,381 --> 01:12:58,723
Yeah? Well, they don't like it

1403
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:00,381
when someone disturbs
their environment.

1404
01:13:00,485 --> 01:13:01,892
Time to go, buddy.

1405
01:13:01,988 --> 01:13:03,843
I know I've been acting crazy,
but there's a reasonable-

1406
01:13:03,941 --> 01:13:05,086
Let me guess, Charlie.

1407
01:13:05,188 --> 01:13:06,530
You believe
you're a lucky charm,

1408
01:13:06,627 --> 01:13:09,409
and you're afraid I'm going
to marry the next guy I date,

1409
01:13:09,507 --> 01:13:11,873
so you've been smothering me
and attacking my friends.

1410
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:12,985
What about George, okay?

1411
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:14,431
What about your date with George?

1412
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:16,352
Wednesday night?
What big date with George?

1413
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:18,075
George is my hairdresser!

1414
01:13:19,809 --> 01:13:22,328
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I was eavesdropping.

1415
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:24,254
Are you really
Charlie Logan the lucky charm?

1416
01:13:24,352 --> 01:13:26,839
Because... I was wondering-

1417
01:13:26,943 --> 01:13:28,950
I can't. I'm sorry.
Cam, listen. Cam-

1418
01:13:29,055 --> 01:13:30,877
- No. Charlie, I just don't think we can
do this anymore.

1419
01:13:30,974 --> 01:13:31,770
- Don't say it!

1420
01:13:31,871 --> 01:13:33,115
- It's not working.
- Please, Cam.

1421
01:13:33,214 --> 01:13:35,189
Please, just don't say it's over.

1422
01:13:37,278 --> 01:13:38,325
It's over.

1423
01:14:06,135 --> 01:14:06,996
Dr. Charlie?

1424
01:14:07,095 --> 01:14:08,917
Hi, Reba.

1425
01:14:09,015 --> 01:14:10,869
I've been
calling you all day.

1426
01:14:10,967 --> 01:14:12,014
Where have you been?

1427
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:13,907
Decided to take
another day off.

1428
01:14:14,007 --> 01:14:16,822
Hey, does our building
have roof access?

1429
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:19,984
Oh, things can't be that bad.

1430
01:14:20,086 --> 01:14:23,184
You know, I owe you a thank-you.

1431
01:14:23,285 --> 01:14:25,968
I met a guy, and he's wonderful.

1432
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:27,629
I really think he's the one.

1433
01:14:27,732 --> 01:14:31,561
That's great.
I'm happy for you.

1434
01:14:32,883 --> 01:14:36,112
You've done a good thing,
Dr. Charlie.

1435
01:14:36,211 --> 01:14:39,374
Helping people find love.

1436
01:14:39,474 --> 01:14:40,651
It's great.

1437
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,703
I bet you didn't think
you'd be responsible

1438
01:14:45,809 --> 01:14:47,401
for helping me
find true love again,

1439
01:14:47,504 --> 01:14:48,616
but you did.

1440
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,410
You did, Dr. Charlie.

1441
01:15:00,782 --> 01:15:02,570
Dr. Charlie, are you all right?

1442
01:15:02,669 --> 01:15:05,483
Love fall like rain.
I'm in pain.

1443
01:15:05,581 --> 01:15:07,010
She was right, Reba.

1444
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:08,064
It's raining.

1445
01:15:08,172 --> 01:15:09,928
Oh, my God!

1446
01:15:13,739 --> 01:15:15,429
Stu, I need
to Google something.

1447
01:15:15,531 --> 01:15:16,611
Unacceptable!

1448
01:15:16,714 --> 01:15:17,892
Hey!

1449
01:15:17,994 --> 01:15:19,107
I wish I hadn't seen that!

1450
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:21,065
A man can't masturbate
in his own house?

1451
01:15:21,161 --> 01:15:22,470
That is disgusting.

1452
01:15:22,569 --> 01:15:23,746
It's a known fact

1453
01:15:23,849 --> 01:15:25,343
that stimulation
of the prostate-

1454
01:15:25,448 --> 01:15:27,684
No, no, no, no.
Just get dressed

1455
01:15:27,784 --> 01:15:29,245
and wash your hands!

1456
01:15:31,848 --> 01:15:33,855
All I know is that I'm hexed.

1457
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:36,348
Yeah. If by hexed
you mean bat-shit crazy,

1458
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:37,566
then yeah,
you're hexed, man.

1459
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:38,684
Don't you remember?

1460
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:40,066
Black lipstick,
long fingernails. A total freak.

1461
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:41,726
She wanted me
to show her my penis.

1462
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:43,422
I wouldn't,
so she pulled my nipples

1463
01:15:43,525 --> 01:15:44,866
and put a hex on me.

1464
01:15:44,965 --> 01:15:47,582
Stu, I've lost the most
special person of my life.

1465
01:15:47,684 --> 01:15:49,626
I have to break this spell.

1466
01:15:49,732 --> 01:15:51,837
You haven't lost me, dude.

1467
01:15:51,939 --> 01:15:53,052
I'm here for you always.

1468
01:15:53,155 --> 01:15:54,781
Just drive the fucking car.

1469
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:00,668
Oh, I'm so sorry, buddy.

1470
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:06,812
Hey, what's up with Chester?

1471
01:16:06,913 --> 01:16:08,735
His girlfriend Molly's sick.

1472
01:16:08,832 --> 01:16:10,742
I sent her away for treatment.

1473
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:12,442
He stopped grooming himself.

1474
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,567
It's heartbreaking, you know?

1475
01:16:16,671 --> 01:16:18,012
If she doesn't come back,

1476
01:16:18,111 --> 01:16:20,445
he may never find another mate.

1477
01:16:25,886 --> 01:16:29,714
Murphy, maybe
you reacted too harshly.

1478
01:16:29,821 --> 01:16:31,576
You should call him.

1479
01:16:31,676 --> 01:16:32,854
I can't, Joe.

1480
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:34,865
You saw him.
He's crazy.

1481
01:16:34,972 --> 01:16:37,753
Love does that
to you sometimes.

1482
01:16:37,851 --> 01:16:39,923
I don't want another one
of your philosophy lessons, Joe.

1483
01:16:40,027 --> 01:16:41,881
He was smothering me.

1484
01:16:41,978 --> 01:16:44,050
I want to be part of someone's life,

1485
01:16:44,154 --> 01:16:45,266
not all of it.

1486
01:16:45,369 --> 01:16:49,525
Have you taken a look
at your bedroom lately?

1487
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:51,053
If you love something,

1488
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:54,476
sometimes you just want
to be surrounded by it.

1489
01:17:01,815 --> 01:17:03,440
That's it. That's it.

1490
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:09,577
How can I get her
to break the spell?

1491
01:17:09,685 --> 01:17:12,051
I don't know. She wanted to look
at your penis, right?

1492
01:17:12,148 --> 01:17:13,555
That was a joke.

1493
01:17:13,652 --> 01:17:14,829
Chuck?

1494
01:17:16,468 --> 01:17:17,645
Chuck, that was a joke.

1495
01:17:18,643 --> 01:17:19,592
Oh, my God.

1496
01:17:25,745 --> 01:17:27,884
Hi. Is your mother home?

1497
01:17:29,553 --> 01:17:32,106
Is your mother's name Anisha?

1498
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:34,412
What's with the 50 questions?

1499
01:17:34,511 --> 01:17:35,853
That was two questions.

1500
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,162
It's a hyperbole.

1501
01:17:37,263 --> 01:17:38,724
Sweetheart, who is it?

1502
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:44,201
Are you Anisha Carpenter?

1503
01:17:44,302 --> 01:17:46,156
Do I know you?

1504
01:17:47,597 --> 01:17:49,222
Charlie Logan.

1505
01:17:50,444 --> 01:17:52,997
Look, I know this is
going to sound crazy,

1506
01:17:53,099 --> 01:17:55,620
but you put a hex on me

1507
01:17:55,725 --> 01:17:56,837
so that all my girlfriends

1508
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,695
would fall in love
with other people,

1509
01:17:58,796 --> 01:18:00,356
and I need you...

1510
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,921
to reverse the spell?

1511
01:18:05,994 --> 01:18:07,106
Woo! That-
That's your pendant.

1512
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,519
You used to wear that!

1513
01:18:08,618 --> 01:18:11,399
You wore it at the party
when you pulled out my hair

1514
01:18:11,497 --> 01:18:13,023
and did the- with the thing.

1515
01:18:13,129 --> 01:18:14,438
And then you wanted
to see my penis,

1516
01:18:14,536 --> 01:18:15,518
and I said no.

1517
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:17,447
Go to your room, Lila.
Lock the door.

1518
01:18:17,544 --> 01:18:18,886
But this is just getting good.

1519
01:18:18,984 --> 01:18:19,911
Now.

1520
01:18:21,384 --> 01:18:23,390
I'm sorry.

1521
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:27,749
What can I do to convince you
to help me?

1522
01:18:45,186 --> 01:18:48,731
This spell-
turn it off, please.

1523
01:18:48,834 --> 01:18:50,175
Charlie, I was just a kid.

1524
01:18:50,274 --> 01:18:51,550
I didn't know
what I was doing.

1525
01:18:51,649 --> 01:18:52,892
I don't even know
what I did.

1526
01:18:52,993 --> 01:18:54,400
You fucked up my life!

1527
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:55,544
That's what you did.

1528
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,241
I asked you
to watch your language.

1529
01:18:57,344 --> 01:18:59,548
Your room. Now.

1530
01:19:02,335 --> 01:19:07,190
Anisha, I am begging you.

1531
01:19:07,294 --> 01:19:09,498
Have you ever wanted
someone so badly

1532
01:19:09,597 --> 01:19:11,669
that you would do anything
to get them?

1533
01:19:13,405 --> 01:19:15,739
If someone's
meant to be yours,

1534
01:19:15,837 --> 01:19:18,291
eventually they will be.

1535
01:19:22,235 --> 01:19:24,089
No.
Wait. No!

1536
01:19:24,186 --> 01:19:25,942
If you think
that by me being here,

1537
01:19:26,043 --> 01:19:27,122
we're supposed
to get together-

1538
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:30,073
I wasn't talking about you.

1539
01:19:31,609 --> 01:19:33,267
My husband Kurt.

1540
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:35,856
Really, Charlie, I was 10.

1541
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,782
I may have thought
I was in love,

1542
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,734
but I was also hot
for Scott Baio.

1543
01:19:41,175 --> 01:19:42,518
So-

1544
01:19:48,087 --> 01:19:50,803
I've blown it.

1545
01:19:51,798 --> 01:19:55,027
Well, then,
all you can do is let her go.

1546
01:20:05,619 --> 01:20:06,699
Yeah, dude!

1547
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:08,396
You're my hero!

1548
01:20:10,738 --> 01:20:13,226
How was she?

1549
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,312
Take me home.

1550
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:17,100
I'm not that easy, man.

1551
01:20:17,201 --> 01:20:20,070
You're going to have to
take me to dinner first.

1552
01:20:20,176 --> 01:20:22,248
You little munchkin.

1553
01:20:22,352 --> 01:20:23,945
I have to set her free,

1554
01:20:24,047 --> 01:20:26,021
let Mother Nature
take its course.

1555
01:20:26,127 --> 01:20:27,915
If you love something,
set it free, right?

1556
01:20:29,614 --> 01:20:31,621
I think Cam is really
going to respond

1557
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:32,936
to the new gay you,
Chuck.

1558
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:35,044
Take me home.

1559
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:36,710
I got a phone call to make.

1560
01:20:48,363 --> 01:20:51,144
Hi. I'm trying to find
Howard Blaine.

1561
01:20:51,242 --> 01:20:52,452
Hi, Howard.

1562
01:20:52,554 --> 01:20:54,114
Um, we've never met,

1563
01:20:54,217 --> 01:20:58,406
but I have a friend
that you really need to meet.

1564
01:21:04,423 --> 01:21:05,536
Howard?

1565
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:21,393
Eat me.

1566
01:22:21,496 --> 01:22:22,925
Eat me.

1567
01:22:23,033 --> 01:22:24,374
Gotcha.

1568
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,825
Owned.

1569
01:22:28,823 --> 01:22:30,710
Owned.

1570
01:22:30,807 --> 01:22:32,432
I'm getting married!

1571
01:22:33,559 --> 01:22:36,013
Chuck! I found my dream girl,

1572
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,932
and it's all because
of you I just proposed.

1573
01:22:39,029 --> 01:22:40,817
Lara, get your sweet ass
over here.

1574
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:42,094
You remember Lara?

1575
01:22:44,021 --> 01:22:46,028
Lara stepped out of heaven-

1576
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:50,353
and into my office
to correct a condition.

1577
01:22:50,451 --> 01:22:51,563
She's got polymastia.

1578
01:22:52,722 --> 01:22:54,445
Has more than two boobs.

1579
01:22:54,546 --> 01:22:56,618
Isn't that perfect for me?
Show him.

1580
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,583
No, no.

1581
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:58,925
No, no, that's okay.

1582
01:22:59,026 --> 01:23:00,203
Really. I don't mind.

1583
01:23:00,305 --> 01:23:02,443
Yeah, I used to be
embarrassed about it,

1584
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:04,268
but that was before
pookie pants here

1585
01:23:04,368 --> 01:23:06,441
made me realize
how special I am.

1586
01:23:06,544 --> 01:23:07,656
Oh, baby,
you're so goddamn special.

1587
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,483
Oh, I love you, monkey pie.

1588
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:10,958
- Okay, show him.
- Okay.

1589
01:23:13,902 --> 01:23:15,396
Is that or is that not

1590
01:23:15,502 --> 01:23:17,606
the most beautiful sight
you've ever seen in your life?

1591
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:20,744
It's like seeing
the Grand Canyon for the first time.

1592
01:23:20,846 --> 01:23:23,301
It's like seeing Earth
from space.

1593
01:23:23,405 --> 01:23:25,063
<i>Like Three's Company,</i>

1594
01:23:25,165 --> 01:23:26,987
but all Chrissies,
you know what I'm saying?

1595
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:28,164
I'm happy for you, buddy.

1596
01:23:29,388 --> 01:23:32,137
But, dude, that's not
why we came, okay?

1597
01:23:32,235 --> 01:23:35,497
Did you know that it smells
like shit in here?

1598
01:23:35,595 --> 01:23:37,351
You may want to open a window.

1599
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:38,792
It's making me a little-

1600
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:40,002
Okay, you tell him, baby.

1601
01:23:40,106 --> 01:23:42,593
Okay, so I'm friends with Katie,
who knows Cam,

1602
01:23:42,697 --> 01:23:44,672
and she said that Cam
said she's leaving today

1603
01:23:44,777 --> 01:23:47,264
for Antarctica
with some penguin guru.

1604
01:23:50,568 --> 01:23:53,415
That's nice.
I'm happy for her.

1605
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:59,070
You sure as shit
don't look happy.

1606
01:23:59,174 --> 01:24:02,207
I loved something,
and I set her free.

1607
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:03,870
She met somebody else.

1608
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:06,907
But I set her free.
That's what's important.

1609
01:24:13,091 --> 01:24:15,033
She's leaving, buddy...

1610
01:24:16,387 --> 01:24:17,630
for Antarctica...

1611
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:20,279
right now.

1612
01:24:20,386 --> 01:24:24,313
She is going.

1613
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:28,344
She's going.

1614
01:24:28,448 --> 01:24:33,564
She's... leaving.

1615
01:24:33,663 --> 01:24:34,939
What the fuck am I doing?

1616
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:36,151
That's what we're saying!

1617
01:24:36,255 --> 01:24:38,840
Go!
Go get your girl, will you?

1618
01:24:38,943 --> 01:24:39,891
He's a little slow.

1619
01:25:10,137 --> 01:25:12,471
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, guys.

1620
01:25:12,568 --> 01:25:13,713
Ma'am, excuse me.

1621
01:25:16,247 --> 01:25:19,247
Has the flight for
Antarctica boarded yet?

1622
01:25:19,351 --> 01:25:21,358
There are no direct flights, sir.

1623
01:25:21,463 --> 01:25:22,477
Connecting flight?

1624
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:24,470
Which one?
There are two.

1625
01:25:24,565 --> 01:25:25,613
Has the flight

1626
01:25:25,718 --> 01:25:28,205
with a passenger
named Cam Wexler boarded yet?

1627
01:25:28,309 --> 01:25:31,407
Sorry, sir.
Can't give you that information.

1628
01:25:31,509 --> 01:25:33,842
Sir, you won't be able to go
to the gate without a ticket.

1629
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:36,329
I have to get
to Antarctica,

1630
01:25:36,436 --> 01:25:39,403
so I will take a ticket
for both planes.

1631
01:25:39,507 --> 01:25:42,954
There are only first class
tickets available, sir.

1632
01:25:43,058 --> 01:25:46,123
Of course there are.
I'll take them both.

1633
01:25:47,633 --> 01:25:49,543
Are you traveling
with any baggage?

1634
01:25:49,649 --> 01:25:50,729
No.

1635
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:52,458
No.

1636
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,894
You do realize
that it's -60 degrees there.

1637
01:25:54,992 --> 01:25:55,974
Yes.

1638
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,653
And that'll be $17,412.

1639
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:08,194
Just do it.

1640
01:26:12,364 --> 01:26:13,444
Here you go.

1641
01:26:21,739 --> 01:26:24,073
Shoes, belt, watch.

1642
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,025
You've never been
to an airport, dummy?

1643
01:26:33,128 --> 01:26:34,372
What goes in pockets?

1644
01:26:34,472 --> 01:26:35,552
Change.

1645
01:26:35,655 --> 01:26:37,542
Change.
Change goes in pockets.

1646
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:38,621
Put it in the little bucket.

1647
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:40,068
Don't waste
my big bucket.

1648
01:26:40,167 --> 01:26:41,661
No.
Small bucket!

1649
01:26:41,766 --> 01:26:43,010
I don't need it.

1650
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:44,125
Want to make this quick?

1651
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:45,571
I am in a real hurry.

1652
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:46,978
Let's do this.
Take your pants off.

1653
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:48,386
What?

1654
01:26:48,485 --> 01:26:50,492
You heard me.
Take your pants off.

1655
01:26:52,453 --> 01:26:54,427
I'm kidding you, weirdo.
Don't do that.

1656
01:26:54,532 --> 01:26:55,906
Why would you do that?

1657
01:26:56,003 --> 01:26:57,248
Come on, let's go.

1658
01:26:59,076 --> 01:27:01,410
Go, go, go.

1659
01:27:21,791 --> 01:27:22,719
Cam.

1660
01:27:23,999 --> 01:27:26,006
Wait!
One more! Here.

1661
01:27:33,469 --> 01:27:34,516
I meant to do that.

1662
01:27:45,243 --> 01:27:46,104
Here.

1663
01:27:46,203 --> 01:27:47,130
Thanks.

1664
01:27:48,826 --> 01:27:49,774
Charlie?

1665
01:27:49,882 --> 01:27:52,053
I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad.

1666
01:27:52,153 --> 01:27:54,836
Antarctica? You couldn't have
just taken her to a movie?

1667
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:56,016
Charlie-

1668
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,192
Look, I know that it's
crazy that I'm here,

1669
01:27:58,296 --> 01:28:00,783
but it felt even crazier
not to come.

1670
01:28:00,887 --> 01:28:03,221
Excuse me.
You have to take your seats.

1671
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:04,180
Charlie-

1672
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:05,326
My entire life,

1673
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:07,023
I've been nothing more
than a stepping-stone

1674
01:28:07,127 --> 01:28:08,785
to every relationship
I've ever been in.

1675
01:28:08,886 --> 01:28:11,755
There's always been a next guy
who's better than me.

1676
01:28:11,861 --> 01:28:15,570
For once in my life,
I want to be that next guy.

1677
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:22,322
I've never said this
to anybody in my whole life.

1678
01:28:22,419 --> 01:28:23,368
Cam...

1679
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:29,034
I love you.

1680
01:28:29,138 --> 01:28:30,512
I love you, Cam.

1681
01:28:32,945 --> 01:28:35,432
Please don't go.

1682
01:28:36,881 --> 01:28:40,229
Charlie, I'm coming back
on Wednesday.

1683
01:28:40,335 --> 01:28:41,644
What?

1684
01:28:41,743 --> 01:28:42,604
Yeah.

1685
01:28:42,703 --> 01:28:43,815
But Howard and-

1686
01:28:43,919 --> 01:28:47,115
Have you met
Howard's wife Marilyn?

1687
01:28:47,215 --> 01:28:49,451
Howard's wife?

1688
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:50,980
Howard's wife.

1689
01:28:51,086 --> 01:28:52,013
Hi.

1690
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:53,452
Hi, Howard's wife.

1691
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:54,499
Howard's wife.

1692
01:28:54,606 --> 01:28:57,061
I know about your call
to Howard.

1693
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,758
I knew you wanted to meet him.

1694
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,682
I knew it would make you happy.

1695
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:02,885
I swear that's all
I've ever wanted to do.

1696
01:29:02,988 --> 01:29:05,638
Plus, mate selection
is up to the female.

1697
01:29:07,627 --> 01:29:09,634
But, Charlie,
you've been acting so-

1698
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:11,331
I know, I know.
Idiotic, nuts.

1699
01:29:11,435 --> 01:29:13,344
And no more lucky charm excuse.

1700
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:16,581
I'm done thinking
about the past and what could be.

1701
01:29:16,682 --> 01:29:19,463
All I care about now is what is.

1702
01:29:19,561 --> 01:29:21,830
And this-

1703
01:29:21,928 --> 01:29:24,067
This is.

1704
01:29:26,951 --> 01:29:28,576
Ladies and gentlemen,

1705
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:30,304
we are about to close
the cabin doors.

1706
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:31,454
Please take your seats.

1707
01:29:34,406 --> 01:29:35,453
That's for you.

1708
01:29:35,557 --> 01:29:37,051
Here.

1709
01:29:56,546 --> 01:29:57,560
Charlie!

1710
01:30:07,007 --> 01:30:08,599
Excuse me, are you that guy who-

1711
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:09,815
He isn't anymore.

1712
01:31:07,475 --> 01:31:08,620
Excuse me.

1713
01:31:22,865 --> 01:31:25,647
Giggle monkey,
what are you looking for?

1714
01:31:25,744 --> 01:31:26,988
Sex tapes.

1715
01:31:27,088 --> 01:31:30,567
What is the point in house sitting
if you can't scope out

1716
01:31:30,671 --> 01:31:33,605
some good old-fashioned
homemade porn!

1717
01:31:33,711 --> 01:31:35,914
- Score!
- You're a genius.

1718
01:31:37,966 --> 01:31:38,948
Okay.

1719
01:31:39,053 --> 01:31:39,980
Hold on.

1720
01:31:47,531 --> 01:31:49,353
Do it. Do it. Oh, yeah.

1721
01:31:49,451 --> 01:31:50,312
Babe.

1722
01:31:50,411 --> 01:31:51,905
Yeah, what?

1723
01:31:52,011 --> 01:31:53,026
Oh, you like that.

1724
01:31:53,131 --> 01:31:54,953
You like when I do
stuff with the-

1725
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:57,352
All right. I'll do it
for just one last time.

1726
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:58,311
This is it.

1727
01:31:58,409 --> 01:31:59,457
Okay.

1728
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:00,575
Because I'm not
into bestiality,

1729
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:01,957
and you know that.
That's documented.

1730
01:32:02,057 --> 01:32:03,486
No, I know. It's fake.

1731
01:32:03,593 --> 01:32:04,454
All right.

1732
01:32:04,553 --> 01:32:05,414
But it's hot.

1733
01:32:05,513 --> 01:32:06,374
Okay.

1734
01:32:06,472 --> 01:32:08,741
Hey. So, uh...

1735
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:09,985
so do you want to-

1736
01:32:10,087 --> 01:32:11,494
You come to this
glacier often?

1737
01:32:12,711 --> 01:32:16,059
I'm really interested in you
because you're a Gentoo soul.

1738
01:32:17,189 --> 01:32:18,466
You like that?

1739
01:32:18,565 --> 01:32:20,769
Yeah, I like that.
Do it faster.

1740
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:22,876
You like... when I do that?

1741
01:32:24,102 --> 01:32:25,924
You ever seen me
go down on a-

1742
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:27,134
Shh. It's okay. No, no.

1743
01:32:27,237 --> 01:32:28,546
Baby, baby, don't worry.

1744
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:31,744
Yeah, I like that.

1745
01:32:37,315 --> 01:32:38,427
You like that, don't you?

1746
01:32:38,531 --> 01:32:39,392
Yeah.

1747
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:40,472
Oh, that's so hot.

1748
01:32:40,578 --> 01:32:42,682
Shh. No more "Uhh. "
No more "Uhh. "

1749
01:32:45,569 --> 01:32:47,260
Do it. Yeah.

1750
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:48,222
Oh, yeah.

1751
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:52,182
That's really good.

1752
01:32:52,288 --> 01:32:53,630
Okay, now do the other thing.

1753
01:32:53,727 --> 01:32:54,807
Do the other thing.

1754
01:32:57,854 --> 01:32:59,828
Look at me. Here's
really what you like.

1755
01:32:59,934 --> 01:33:01,624
Yeah, you know what I like.

1756
01:33:01,726 --> 01:33:05,108
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm really
getting in the mood now.

1757
01:33:05,213 --> 01:33:07,035
You like when I eat
your penguin ass?

1758
01:33:07,133 --> 01:33:09,336
Yeah. Baby,
I think I'm ready.

1759
01:33:10,652 --> 01:33:14,034
Turn it off, baby.

1760
01:33:15,675 --> 01:33:16,788
You still in the mood?

1761
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:17,752
Yeah.

1762
01:33:17,851 --> 01:33:18,712
All right.
