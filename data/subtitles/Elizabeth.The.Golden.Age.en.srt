3
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:14,026
Why do you go
among the people, Majesty?

4
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,426
I tell you plainly,
you will be murdered.

5
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:19,144
Every Catholic in England
is a potential assassin!

6
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,514
Be warned
by the atrocities in France.

7
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,362
We know the Catholics
take their orders
from Spain.

8
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:27,179
The Spanish speak
openly of Mary Stuart

9
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:29,067
as Queen of England
in waiting.

10
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:31,074
Their loyalty is to
the Pope in Rome!

11
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:34,149
How many Catholics
are there in England, sir?

12
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:35,650
Lmmense numbers,
Majesty.

13
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:39,751
Half the nation
cling to the old
superstitions.

14
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,088
What would you have me do?

15
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:45,899
Hang half the people
of England
or just imprison them?

16
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:48,298
We must act, Majesty.

17
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:51,081
Our inaction
is perceived
as weakness.

18
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:54,507
If my people break the law,
they shall be punished.

19
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:56,776
Until that day,
they shall be protected.

20
00:03:56,843 --> 00:04:00,193
Majesty, we have
proven reason to fear
every Catholic in the...

21
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:03,137
Fear creates fear.

22
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:07,074
I am not ignorant
of the dangers, sir.

23
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:10,693
But I will not
punish my people
for their beliefs.

24
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,967
Only for their deeds.

25
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:16,449
I am assured
that the people of England
love their Queen.

26
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,269
My constant endeavor
is to earn that love.

27
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:48,288
My Queen.

28
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:06,822
Our friends write
to give us hope.

29
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,310
Soon England's
true believers will rise up

30
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:11,906
against the bastard
usurper Elizabeth

31
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:13,668
and slit her throat.

32
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:15,298
That's enough!

33
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:20,964
Slit her throat? Please.

34
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:25,954
And when that bastard
usurper is dead,
my lady will be queen.

35
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,168
Your bishops are preaching
that God is showing
his displeasure

36
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,345
because the Queen
is still unmarried,

37
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:39,750
some rudely
suggesting infertile.

38
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,822
What nonsense.

39
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:43,838
Dangerous nonsense.

40
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,399
Mary Stuart has a son.

41
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,504
Why does everyone
torment me with Mary Stuart?

42
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:51,779
It's not her fault
she's next in line
to the throne.

43
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:52,797
Don't hide your face.

44
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:54,398
So long as you
have no issue.

45
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:55,846
If you were
to produce an heir,

46
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:57,699
there'd be no more talk
of Mary, Queen of Scots.

47
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:01,084
I've heard it's customary
to obtain a husband
before producing an heir.

48
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:04,994
We shall have to hunt
out a husband
for you soon, Bess.

49
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:06,339
Not too soon,
my lady.

50
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,869
There are husbands
to be had.

51
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:09,285
You don't want
to be married?

52
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,692
I'll want to be married
if I want the man...

53
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,319
Austria. France.

54
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:15,237
Turkey. Turkey has a sultan.
China has an emperor.

55
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:17,670
I confine myself
to the possible.

56
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:20,288
That's where you and I
differ, Walsingham.

57
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:23,076
I find the impossible
far more interesting.

58
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:27,584
What kind of man
would you want?

59
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,502
An honest man
with friendly eyes.

60
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:32,901
And good legs.
And sweet breath.

61
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:35,072
So you can kiss him
without choking.

62
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,033
There must be
any amount of princes

63
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:42,403
in the undiscovered lands
across the sea.

64
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:46,656
Find me an honest one
of those.

65
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:05,826
Since when do we discuss
private matters
in public spaces?

66
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,932
I ask Your Majesty's
forgiveness.

67
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:12,096
Have my doctors
confirm that the Queen
is still fertile.

68
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:13,891
The people need
to be reassured.

69
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:14,939
I care
for your safety.

70
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:17,216
The threats to your
person are real.

71
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:18,779
You know very well
if I fall,

72
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:21,723
you'll all come
tumbling down after me.

73
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:23,803
The sea wall at Dover
is cracking, Francis.

74
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,875
We have no money
to rebuild our defenses.

75
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,250
Turn your mind
to that threat.

76
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:47,233
May we have wisdom
not to fear shadows
in the night.

77
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,595
And courage when the day
of danger truly dawns.

78
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:28,415
My time has come,
Majesty.

79
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:32,701
Send me back to England
to begin God's work.

80
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,201
Your Majesty.

81
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:15,003
Guards!
Take hold of him!

82
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:19,744
A puddle in the way,

83
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:21,693
Majesty.

84
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:28,475
A puddle.

85
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:51,928
Puddle.

86
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:00,596
You'll have to see
the Lord Chamberlain, sir.

87
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:01,849
Which one is he?

88
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:03,643
He's over there.

89
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:05,336
You can't come in.

90
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,807
So how am I to see him
if you won't let me through?

91
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,846
You must wait for him
to come out.

92
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:10,868
And when will he
come out?

93
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,056
There's no way
of knowing that.

94
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:15,542
I had less trouble
than this boarding
a Spanish ship.

95
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:21,495
What if enemy ships
should sail up the Thames,
can the docks be closed?

96
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,605
Not closed, Majesty.
But the gun positions...

97
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:25,304
Spanish...

98
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:31,416
Ambassador.

99
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,389
King Eric of Sweden,
Majesty.

100
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:36,698
Not again.

101
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:37,813
Still madly in love with you.

102
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:38,932
Still mad, you mean.

103
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,941
Lvan, Tsar
of all the Russias.

104
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,421
Where's Bess?

105
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,452
Known as
"lvan the Terrible," Majesty.

106
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:54,455
Late.

107
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:56,730
I beg
Your Majesty's forgiveness.

108
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:58,841
Given.

109
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:03,610
Once.

110
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:06,677
The Archduke
Charles of Austria, Majesty.

111
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:13,013
The puddle man
is outside, Majesty.

112
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:14,164
My suitors.

113
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:17,620
Younger brother
to Maximilian II,
Holy Roman Emperor.

114
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:20,115
Cousin of Philip of Spain.
Wealthy.

115
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,708
He's rather handsome.

116
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,034
How old is he?

117
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:28,475
Young,
I believe, Majesty.

118
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:32,087
An Austrian alliance
would keep France quiet.

119
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,360
And put Philip on a leash.

120
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,283
I've become
almost enthusiastic.

121
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,120
Send for him.

122
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,491
<i>Danke sch√∂n.</i>

123
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,969
How much longer
do you think I can play
this game, Francis?

124
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:48,946
Virginity is an asset
that holds its value well.

125
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,874
Walter Raleigh, Majesty.

126
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:55,731
Your Majesty, this man
is a notorious pirate.

127
00:11:55,803 --> 00:12:00,472
Spanish gold stolen
from Spanish ships,
attacked without provocation.

128
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:07,602
Well, sir, what do you want?

129
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:10,707
I have just returned
from the New World, Majesty.

130
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:13,299
I have claimed
the fertile coast
in your name

131
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:15,990
and called it Virginia

132
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:18,393
in honor
of our Virgin Queen.

133
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,215
Virginia?

134
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:23,894
And when I marry,
will you change
the name to Conjugia?

135
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,902
I ask your gracious
permission, Majesty,

136
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,556
to return to the New World
with your royal warrant

137
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,474
to found a colony
under the laws
and protections of England.

138
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:33,749
He wants money.

139
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:35,990
Who are they?

140
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:38,360
Natives of the
Americas, Majesty.

141
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,635
Have they no ruler
of their own?

142
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:46,389
None to match
England's Queen.

143
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:47,886
These gentlemen
are welcome.

144
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:49,717
See that they
are treated well.

145
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:51,696
I also come
bearing gifts
for Your Majesty.

146
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:56,144
These gifts, Majesty,
are the fruits of piracy,

147
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:58,388
the true property
of the realm of Spain.

148
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:01,873
Let's see, shall we?
What have you brought me?

149
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:12,855
<i>Patata, Majesty.</i>

150
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,855
You eat it.
Very nourishing.

151
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:36,719
Tobacco.

152
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:40,876
You breathe its smoke.

153
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,951
Very stimulating.

154
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,542
Gold.

155
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:59,727
Courtesy of a Spanish ship
that found itself unable
to complete its journey.

156
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,774
Forgive me, Majesty.

157
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:05,426
I find the air
has become stale.

158
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:08,878
I am sensitive
to the smell
of open sewers.

159
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:19,542
I cannot accept
the fruits of piracy,
Mr. Raleigh.

160
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:23,250
Philip of Spain is no friend
of England, Majesty.

161
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:27,509
The more gold I take from him,
the safer you will be.

162
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,995
Well, well.

163
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:31,924
A political pirate.

164
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,732
And Your Majesty's
most loyal subject.

165
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:39,731
Welcome home, Mr. Raleigh.
Lord Howard, the docks.

166
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,476
Master Raleigh.

167
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,403
You eat it...

168
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,268
You traitor!

169
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:14,158
Judas!

170
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:16,682
You're Walsingham's pawn!

171
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,368
Don't do this!
I didn't say anything!

172
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,885
You're a
Protestant traitor!

173
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:26,349
Don't do it! Don't!

174
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:37,261
Don't!
Hold his head!

175
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:39,754
You Judas! You Judas!
Stop!

176
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:41,104
You Judas!

177
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:09,873
The traitor's dead.
We must act!

178
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:17,458
Why do we not strike?
What are we waiting for?

179
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:23,336
You wait for my order.

180
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:30,926
Walsingham knows
too much already.
One traitor is dead.

181
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:34,546
Who can I trust now?

182
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:43,823
There's a visitor
waiting, sir.

183
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,573
William.

184
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,448
Hello, Francis.

185
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,863
You've always
been a fellow who
delighted in surprises.

186
00:16:57,937 --> 00:16:59,759
You look well,
Francis.

187
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:03,687
Well, you look dreadful.
They're not feeding
you in Paris.

188
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:07,087
You can't learn
the secrets of the universe
on an empty stomach.

189
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,246
<i>Then she my heart beguiled</i>

190
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:15,590
Mary. William.
Supper is ready.

191
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,019
William.

192
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:20,518
Have you spoken
to the Queen?

193
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:21,673
I speak
with the Queen daily.

194
00:17:21,744 --> 00:17:23,598
You work too hard.
You're a sick man.

195
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:25,224
William,
come over here
and sit by me.

196
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:26,638
William, if we are not
allowed to sin,

197
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:27,849
maybe we could
talk theology.

198
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,702
You have done enough.
No man could do more.

199
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:32,906
I can't leave
the court yet, Ursula.
She needs me.

200
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:34,602
Never listens to me.
Not a thought for his health.

201
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:36,013
So you talk to him,
he's your brother.

202
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,822
William, what do they say
in Paris about the Pope's
call for holy war?

203
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:40,869
Many welcome it.

204
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,602
Why must we talk
about war?

205
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:44,777
Tell us your nice
news, William.

206
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,887
Are you married yet?
Not yet.

207
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,131
Mary, would you leave
William alone, please?

208
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,851
Sweet, sit.

209
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,279
Grace?

210
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,348
Oh, Lord,
provider of all things,

211
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,333
we offer Thee
our humble thanks.

212
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:02,190
In the name
of the Holy Trinity, amen.

213
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,335
Amen.

214
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,726
More lines on my face.

215
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:18,919
Where do they come from?

216
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,030
Smile lines, my lady.

217
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:23,306
Smile lines?

218
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:27,017
When do I ever smile?

219
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,424
Now you have
smile lines, too.

220
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:43,148
<i>The beauty of Your Majesty</i>

221
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:47,403
<i>is dazzling to my eyes.</i>

222
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:58,278
I am overwhelmed.

223
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:01,644
I am conquered.

224
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,164
I die.

225
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:07,140
Only your love,

226
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,733
<i>my stattlich Elizabeth,</i>

227
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:11,845
can restore me into life.

228
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:15,875
Your Highness
does me great honor.

229
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:26,278
Oh, Elizabeth.

230
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:31,625
How blessed am I
to stand in your
fabled presence.

231
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,266
Ah, Elizabeth.

232
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:37,511
To speak your name
is to hear celestial music.

233
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:44,512
May that sweet sound

234
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:48,231
guide me through my life
to come, Elizabeth.

235
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,892
I have traveled here
to this illustrious court

236
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:57,866
in the hope that
our two great nations

237
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,416
might be
joined in love.

238
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:16,775
He interests me.

239
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:20,930
Talk to him.

240
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:24,068
Him, my lady?

241
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:25,250
Him.

242
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,541
I adore the natives
you brought. I don't suppose
you could get one for me.

243
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:34,984
They're not
dangerous, are they?

244
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:36,806
That depends
on what you propose
to do with them.

245
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:39,240
I'd dress him up
in mulberry
colored silk,

246
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:42,121
and have him walk
behind me,
carrying my cloak.

247
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:52,262
I have a secret,
my dear.

248
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:56,546
I pretend there's
a pane of glass,

249
00:20:56,616 --> 00:21:00,413
<i>eine Glasscheibe
between me and them.</i>

250
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:05,729
They can see me,
but they cannot touch me.

251
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:09,792
You should try it.

252
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:15,488
Majesty, I am...

253
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,989
It is something,
after all,

254
00:21:26,057 --> 00:21:31,271
to take a blank on the map
and build there
a shining city.

255
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:34,750
Which you will no doubt
name after yourself.

256
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:36,230
No doubt.

257
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:45,252
May I ask
a question in return?

258
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,301
Of course.

259
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,547
How am I to win
the Queen's favor?

260
00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:50,022
Why should I tell you that?

261
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:53,284
I've little enough to offer,
but whatever I have to give,

262
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:57,151
ask, and it's yours.

263
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:02,434
Say what you mean to say
as plainly as possible.

264
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:06,655
All men flatter the Queen
in hope of advancement.

265
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:11,238
Pay her the compliment
of truth.

266
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:13,058
I don't even know
your name.

267
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:14,653
Elizabeth Throckmorton.

268
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:16,614
A second
Elizabeth?

269
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,817
Everyone calls me Bess.

270
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:23,675
Your most serene Majesty,
bright star of our firmament,

271
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,452
we present our humble masque
of the heavenly spheres.

272
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:33,948
His Highness is tired
after his long journey.

273
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,957
No man
can become tired

274
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:40,740
in the presence of
so lovely a queen.

275
00:23:12,484 --> 00:23:16,990
His Highness, the Archduke
informs me that my charms
overwhelm him.

276
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,673
He will retire
to his private chambers
to rest.

277
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:31,842
I don't want him hurt
by your schemes.

278
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,395
So how should
we proceed?

279
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:36,606
Perhaps we should
all retire.

280
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:43,165
I suspect him of being
a professional charmer.

281
00:23:43,236 --> 00:23:44,347
Am I right?

282
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,234
He is certainly
charming, my lady.

283
00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:50,563
Well, there are
duller professions.

284
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,471
You like him, don't you?

285
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:55,929
He's a man
that lives in a world
far beyond the court.

286
00:23:57,572 --> 00:23:59,939
It's refreshing.

287
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:01,694
Well.

288
00:24:01,763 --> 00:24:03,803
We shall let him
come again.

289
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,074
Blue.

290
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,909
<i>Can you imagine
what it is to cross an ocean?</i>

291
00:24:15,714 --> 00:24:20,701
For weeks, you see nothing
but the horizon,
perfect and empty.

292
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:25,089
You live in the grip of fear.

293
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:26,839
Fear of storms.

294
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:30,240
Fear of sickness on board.

295
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:33,656
Fear of the immensity.

296
00:24:34,786 --> 00:24:38,080
So you must drive
that fear down deep
into your belly.

297
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:41,056
Study your charts.

298
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:43,615
Watch your compass.

299
00:24:44,354 --> 00:24:46,361
Pray for a fair wind.

300
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,789
And hope,

301
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:52,026
pure,

302
00:24:52,673 --> 00:24:54,079
naked,

303
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:56,380
fragile

304
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:59,198
hope.

305
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,711
Majesty, the Archduke
and court are waiting.

306
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:05,598
Let them wait.

307
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,982
Go on, Mr. Raleigh.

308
00:25:10,497 --> 00:25:12,951
You were hoping.

309
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:16,478
At first,
it's no more than
a haze on the horizon.

310
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:23,423
So you watch.

311
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,898
You watch.

312
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:34,070
Then it's a smudge,

313
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,688
a shadow on the far water.

314
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:41,565
For a day.

315
00:25:42,463 --> 00:25:44,286
For another day.

316
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:51,479
The stain slowly spreads
along the horizon taking form,

317
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:57,436
until on the third day,
you let yourself believe.

318
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,625
You dare to whisper
the word.

319
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:04,536
Land.

320
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,540
Land.

321
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:10,708
Life.

322
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:13,749
Resurrection.

323
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:17,270
The true adventure.

324
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,948
Coming out of
the vast unknown,

325
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:23,127
out of the immensity,

326
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:26,394
into new life.

327
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:30,394
That,

328
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:34,451
Your Majesty,
is the New World.

329
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:47,355
I like
your immensities.

330
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:53,499
Your ocean is an image
of eternity, I think.

331
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:57,842
Such great spaces
make us small.

332
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,560
Do we discover
the New World,
Mr. Raleigh,

333
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:04,978
or does the New World
discover us?

334
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:07,769
You speak like
a true explorer.

335
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:11,132
I like you,
Mr. Raleigh.

336
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:17,178
And I like you.

337
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:28,307
You know, of course,
that when I like a man,
I reward him.

338
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,510
I have heard that.

339
00:27:31,612 --> 00:27:33,400
And what have you
to say about it?

340
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:35,738
Reward my mission,
Majesty, not me.

341
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:38,008
Is the mission
not the man?

342
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:40,890
Then you leave me free
to like you in return.

343
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:48,438
Go on.

344
00:27:50,844 --> 00:27:53,145
I think it must be hard
for so great a queen

345
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:56,953
to know the simple pleasure
of being liked for herself.

346
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:05,009
Now you grow dull.

347
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:42,009
Come on!

348
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:09,296
Mine.

349
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,880
You have
the stronger horse.

350
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,741
Yours carries
the lighter load.

351
00:29:14,808 --> 00:29:16,182
No.

352
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:19,731
The Queen does not
give way to others.

353
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,866
Whoa! Whoa!

354
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:33,334
Forgive me, Majesty.
My horse doesn't seem
to know his place yet.

355
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:37,880
Have you ever
known your place,
Mr. Raleigh?

356
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:43,670
Oh, come on!

357
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:15,469
It's from her.

358
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:19,920
Mary Stuart
is the heart and soul
of our enterprise.

359
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:35,027
Make sure she
and only she reads this.

360
00:30:35,478 --> 00:30:37,451
We wait for her order.

361
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,492
The order
must be given clearly.

362
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:52,050
The jailer, madam.

363
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:56,971
My noble jailer.

364
00:31:00,117 --> 00:31:02,800
Am I a danger to England
even when I pray?

365
00:31:02,868 --> 00:31:06,000
As always, ma'am,
my concern
is for your safety.

366
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:11,538
I pray for
my cousin Elizabeth.

367
00:31:14,196 --> 00:31:16,499
Do you think
she prays for me?

368
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:25,810
Is it true

369
00:31:27,412 --> 00:31:31,088
that I've never known
the pleasure of being
liked for myself?

370
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,655
I hope you believe
I like you for yourself,
my lady.

371
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:43,538
Is anyone ever liked
simply for themselves?
I doubt it.

372
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:46,286
Are you?

373
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:51,757
Men like you
because you're pretty,

374
00:31:53,682 --> 00:31:57,031
and because you have
the ear of the Queen.

375
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:59,506
No doubt.

376
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,826
Him, too.

377
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:08,108
He likes you because
he wants my favor.

378
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:13,904
You do realize that.

379
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:17,799
Yes, my lady.

380
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,538
And the other thing,
too, of course.

381
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:24,398
But then,
all men want that.

382
00:32:24,465 --> 00:32:27,663
Male desire
confers no distinction.

383
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:31,721
Oh, I envy you, Bess.

384
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:38,184
You're free to have
what I cannot have.

385
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:41,740
You're my adventurer.

386
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:31,782
Thank you for coming.

387
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:34,344
You mustn't send
letters to the palace.

388
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:36,041
You know
what would happen
if I was caught.

389
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:37,933
I need your help.

390
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,291
More money?
No.

391
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,548
My father doesn't
want to hide
like this anymore.

392
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:45,573
Of course.

393
00:33:45,646 --> 00:33:47,851
We both want to get
back into favor
with the court.

394
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,381
That's impossible.

395
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,464
You know that
you're Papists.

396
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:52,845
Why impossible?

397
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:55,400
Everyone at court
has a Papist somewhere
in their family.

398
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:56,846
Francis.
Just as you have.

399
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,758
Speak to the Queen.
You are her favorite.

400
00:33:59,823 --> 00:34:03,238
My father and I
will embrace the new faith.

401
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,423
Cousin Bess.
No.

402
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:06,403
We have known
each other
all our lives.

403
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:09,445
I would do nothing
to harm you.

404
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,809
Why can't you help us?
They will kill us!

405
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:29,034
Oh. Do not tease me,
Mr. Raleigh.

406
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,371
There's nothing
I'd like to do more.

407
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:32,648
So why don't you?

408
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,190
All right, then. I will.

409
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:41,414
You see? You lie.

410
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:44,387
You don't want me
on your ship at all.
You're a liar.

411
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:49,864
Bess. Would you
like to go to sea?

412
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:51,460
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

413
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:54,250
Women bring bad luck
on board ship.

414
00:34:54,317 --> 00:34:55,527
Do they?

415
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:57,898
Lock up a hundred men
in a space smaller
than this room

416
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,135
for months at a time.

417
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:01,416
Men have needs.

418
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:04,103
A beautiful woman
would drive us all mad.

419
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,014
Men have needs?

420
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:14,086
Let them stay on land
and see to their needs.

421
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:18,565
Mr. Raleigh
is eager to sail away
to his maiden colony.

422
00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:23,525
We must persuade him
to stay a little longer.
Mustn't we, ladies?

423
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,746
Bess?

424
00:35:45,387 --> 00:35:46,335
No!

425
00:35:46,668 --> 00:35:50,246
Wait! What do you want?
Who are you?

426
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,927
Let me go, damn it!
Who the hell are you?

427
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:23,807
If you won't assist me,
perhaps your father will.

428
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,409
No.

429
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,260
Enough.

430
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:33,922
Enough.

431
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:36,610
Enough.

432
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,952
Yes?

433
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:44,126
You cannot
save England now.

434
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,391
The Enterprise
has begun.

435
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,221
Ambassador?

436
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:56,643
What do you know
of the Enterprise
of England?

437
00:36:56,713 --> 00:36:58,818
The Enterprise?
Forgive me, Majesty,
I'm not familiar...

438
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:02,184
Two armies landing
on the coasts
of Sussex and Norfolk.

439
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:05,063
Mary Stuart is to be
set free and placed
on the English throne,

440
00:37:05,128 --> 00:37:06,851
and I am to be
assassinated.

441
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,295
Does any of this
sound familiar?

442
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,538
I know nothing
of any invasion plans...

443
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:11,681
Well, I refer to
this plan as the
Enterprise of England,

444
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:14,599
<i>it should more
accurately be called
la Empresa de Inglaterra</i>

445
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:16,387
because it is
a Spanish plan.

446
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:18,278
The plan of my
one-time brother-in-law,

447
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:20,134
your king,
to attack my country.

448
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:24,161
Your country?
It is my country
that is under attack.

449
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,255
<i>Your so-called piratas,
your pirates attack
our merchant ships daily.</i>

450
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:32,485
And you...
You think we don't know
where the orders come from?

451
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:35,235
The whole world knows
these pirates sail up
the Thames,

452
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:38,947
all the way
to your royal bed.

453
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,076
You will leave
my presence, sir.

454
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,860
Go back to your rat hole.

455
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:59,108
Tell Philip I fear
neither him, nor his priests,
nor his armies.

456
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:01,443
Tell him if he wants to shake
his little fist at us,

457
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,688
we're ready to give him
such a bite,

458
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,483
he'll wish he'd kept his hands
in his pockets.

459
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,445
You see a leaf fall
and you think you know
which way the wind blows.

460
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:13,057
Well, there is
a wind coming, madam,

461
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,329
that will sweep away
your pride.

462
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,804
I, too, can command
the wind, sir!

463
00:38:23,878 --> 00:38:28,221
I have a hurricane in me
that will strip Spain bare
if you dare to try me!

464
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:51,706
What are you staring at?

465
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,228
Lower your eyes.
I am the Queen!

466
00:38:56,132 --> 00:38:59,231
You are not my equal, sir,
and you never will be!

467
00:40:14,755 --> 00:40:18,398
<i>The alignments of the planets
is most unusual this year.</i>

468
00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:21,442
Mars is due to take
the ascendant

469
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:25,434
three days
after the anniversary
of Your Majesty's birth.

470
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:28,800
And also on that day,
there is a full moon,

471
00:40:28,865 --> 00:40:33,820
which governs
the fortune of all princes
of the female gender.

472
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,896
Princes of the
female gender.

473
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:40,476
I mean to say,
a prince who is
also a woman.

474
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:43,840
Yes, Dr. Dee,
I am following you.

475
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:45,978
What does it mean?

476
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:52,639
It means the rise
of a great empire, Majesty,
and the fall of another.

477
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:54,751
Convulsions.

478
00:40:58,144 --> 00:41:02,137
Which empire is to rise
and which is to fall?

479
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,347
That I cannot say,
Majesty.

480
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:08,311
Astrology is,
as yet, more an art
than a science.

481
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:10,719
Nothing more, Dr. Dee?

482
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:13,304
No more specific calamities
we can guard against?

483
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:17,599
He means,
will I be assassinated?

484
00:41:17,664 --> 00:41:20,447
Walsingham, would you
leave us for a moment?

485
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,222
And the private life
of this prince
of the female gender,

486
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:34,360
what do the stars
foretell there?

487
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:37,114
These are matters
of state, Majesty.

488
00:41:37,184 --> 00:41:41,144
Surely the stars
foretell matters
of state, Dr. Dee.

489
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:46,431
For such a prediction
I must look
in a different chart.

490
00:41:55,391 --> 00:41:57,333
Wonderful.

491
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:00,534
Such strength.

492
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,532
You will need
all your strength
in the days to come.

493
00:42:05,342 --> 00:42:09,204
But you doubt yourself,
my child.

494
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:13,275
I have not seen
fear in your face
for such a long time.

495
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,775
Have I reason to fear?

496
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:16,985
Something has
weakened you.

497
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,623
There are
hard days coming.

498
00:42:25,534 --> 00:42:27,737
But I am no prophet.

499
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:31,677
I see no more
than the shadows
of ghosts.

500
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:37,565
Visitor, sir.

501
00:42:48,797 --> 00:42:49,974
Sorry to come
aboard your ship

502
00:42:50,045 --> 00:42:52,117
without permission,
Mr. Raleigh.

503
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:03,731
Welcome aboard.

504
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:06,548
The Queen wishes
to see you.

505
00:43:09,244 --> 00:43:10,454
She asks me
to assure you...

506
00:43:10,525 --> 00:43:12,532
I need
no assurances, Bess.

507
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:16,373
I'm no courtier.
Never have been.

508
00:43:16,445 --> 00:43:18,833
Then you should
say so in person.

509
00:43:26,364 --> 00:43:28,536
This is
my life, Bess.

510
00:43:29,947 --> 00:43:31,769
This is where
I belong.

511
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,594
It seems to be
a lonely life.

512
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:41,402
Sometimes.
But it's the life
I've chosen.

513
00:43:44,731 --> 00:43:46,672
I understand.

514
00:44:01,594 --> 00:44:04,016
You ask permission to go.

515
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,978
Yes, Majesty.

516
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:09,358
You plan to return
to your colony

517
00:44:09,434 --> 00:44:13,711
for two, maybe three,
four years.

518
00:44:13,786 --> 00:44:17,081
If Your Majesty grants me
your royal warrant.

519
00:44:18,043 --> 00:44:20,344
That is a long time.

520
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:23,574
There's nothing
for me here.

521
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:26,936
At sea,
I know what I'm to do.
I know the risks.

522
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:29,237
Here...
No. You're wrong.

523
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:32,601
You're needed here.

524
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:34,389
As captain of my
personal guard.

525
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,702
Captain of your guard?

526
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:36,717
Kneel.

527
00:44:36,793 --> 00:44:38,222
Majesty.

528
00:44:38,297 --> 00:44:40,599
I said, kneel.

529
00:44:45,144 --> 00:44:47,632
Sir Walter Raleigh.

530
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,460
Well, you may express
your gratitude.

531
00:44:59,768 --> 00:45:02,768
This is too great an honor.

532
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,059
If it's so great an honor,
why are you staring
at your boots?

533
00:45:07,768 --> 00:45:09,362
You know why.

534
00:45:10,552 --> 00:45:12,527
Now you stare
at the wall.

535
00:45:12,601 --> 00:45:14,836
Am I so hideous
you can't even look
me in the face?

536
00:45:14,903 --> 00:45:15,885
Why do you speak
like a fool

537
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,894
when you are anything
but a fool?

538
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,494
Fool?

539
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:26,094
Yes, I am a vain
and foolish woman.

540
00:45:26,168 --> 00:45:29,101
And you, you...
You come here

541
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:32,373
as if from another time.
And I've...

542
00:45:34,391 --> 00:45:38,864
You have real adventures.
You go where the maps end.
And I'd...

543
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:43,532
I would follow you there
if I could. Believe me.

544
00:45:53,623 --> 00:45:57,235
The storm clouds
are gathering.
You are needed here.

545
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,684
You cannot leave England.

546
00:46:30,902 --> 00:46:33,902
"For he that will
save his life
will lose it.

547
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:37,965
<i>"And he that will
lose his life for my sake
shall find it. "</i>

548
00:46:39,222 --> 00:46:41,972
Lord be with us
as the end approaches.

549
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:47,500
We will not fear the coming
of the shadow of death.

550
00:47:06,164 --> 00:47:09,262
Sorry, I didn't mean
to disturb you.

551
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:11,635
I thought I prayed
in silence.

552
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:12,878
You did.

553
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:25,224
Excuse me, sir.
I must go to the Queen.

554
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,367
The man who was
hanged today...

555
00:47:28,436 --> 00:47:30,856
He was your cousin.

556
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:35,567
Yes.

557
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:37,523
I'm sorry.

558
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:46,155
The last time
I saw him,

559
00:47:47,954 --> 00:47:49,777
he needed my help.

560
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:53,485
I did nothing.

561
00:47:53,554 --> 00:47:55,179
What could
you have done?

562
00:47:56,563 --> 00:47:58,603
I don't know.

563
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:01,711
Now he's dead.

564
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:06,449
I keep seeing his face.
I keep seeing his eyes.

565
00:48:06,514 --> 00:48:09,581
Believe me, there's nothing
that you could have done
that would have spared him.

566
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,177
I'm so afraid.

567
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:13,289
We're all human, Bess.

568
00:48:14,481 --> 00:48:17,068
We do what we can.

569
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:07,559
<i>Your laundress
was found to be carrying
letters in her washing.</i>

570
00:49:08,527 --> 00:49:10,438
Not her job, I think.

571
00:49:10,512 --> 00:49:12,650
How am I to send
my intimate letters?

572
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:15,239
Through me.
And you will read them.

573
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:18,159
With respectful
admiration.

574
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,744
Am I to have
no privacy?

575
00:49:20,815 --> 00:49:21,797
No.

576
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:23,431
You disappoint me, sir.

577
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:26,856
The Queen orders
these measures
for your protection.

578
00:49:26,927 --> 00:49:28,302
The Queen?

579
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:30,342
I am a queen.

580
00:49:42,286 --> 00:49:44,873
They call her
the Virgin Queen.

581
00:49:46,255 --> 00:49:47,815
Why is that, sir?

582
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:51,822
Can it be that no man
will have her?

583
00:51:21,356 --> 00:51:23,777
Let him
throw you round.

584
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:26,503
Be bold. Come on,
you can trust him.

585
00:51:26,572 --> 00:51:28,327
And jump.

586
00:51:28,396 --> 00:51:31,744
When I bend like this,
you take a leap
into the air.

587
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:34,922
The Volta.

588
00:51:34,987 --> 00:51:37,322
I require all my ladies
to learn it.

589
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:40,902
You see
how fearless Bess is?

590
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:43,556
You like your ladies
to jump at your command.

591
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:44,641
Do you think
that wrong?

592
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:47,780
No. You are the Queen.
You are to be obeyed.

593
00:51:48,746 --> 00:51:50,951
To tell you
the truth,

594
00:51:51,018 --> 00:51:53,157
I'm very, very tired
of always being
in control.

595
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:55,137
Nonsense.

596
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,414
What?

597
00:51:57,483 --> 00:52:01,126
You eat and
drink control.

598
00:52:01,195 --> 00:52:03,780
Is that so?

599
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:07,686
Bess.

600
00:52:07,755 --> 00:52:09,958
You should try a dance
with Sir Walter.

601
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:12,230
He's eager
to show us his skill.

602
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:15,811
No skill at all, Majesty.
I don't know the steps.

603
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,987
Come now.

604
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:26,239
You stand
like this,

605
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:29,663
with your hands here.

606
00:52:29,737 --> 00:52:31,231
And when she jumps,

607
00:52:31,306 --> 00:52:34,688
on the fifth step,

608
00:52:35,114 --> 00:52:37,318
you lift her.

609
00:52:37,385 --> 00:52:39,175
What could be simpler?

610
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:45,284
Take your position,
Sir Walter.

611
00:52:47,016 --> 00:52:48,358
I am to be obeyed.

612
00:52:50,664 --> 00:52:52,804
As Your Majesty
wishes.

613
00:52:55,016 --> 00:52:58,115
Hold her firmly.
I don't want her dropped.

614
00:53:05,512 --> 00:53:07,400
Play.

615
00:53:07,528 --> 00:53:08,804
Six counts.

616
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:12,003
One, two, three,
and lift, down.

617
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:49,572
Leave us.

618
00:53:51,014 --> 00:53:53,219
I want both of them
left alone.

619
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,755
Madam.

620
00:55:14,884 --> 00:55:16,541
I must reply.

621
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:20,384
"If our forces
are in readiness,

622
00:55:20,452 --> 00:55:23,648
"both within and without
the realm,

623
00:55:23,715 --> 00:55:29,313
"then your Queen commands you
to set the gentlemen to work."

624
00:55:29,378 --> 00:55:31,135
I think we have it.

625
00:55:37,987 --> 00:55:39,329
Yes.

626
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,228
Let God's
work begin.

627
00:56:00,387 --> 00:56:01,402
Where have you been?

628
00:56:01,474 --> 00:56:03,994
I met up
with some old friends.

629
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:06,271
From Paris, no doubt.

630
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:08,193
We haven't
seen you for days.

631
00:56:08,259 --> 00:56:09,784
Yes.

632
00:56:09,858 --> 00:56:11,746
Now you're back.

633
00:56:16,514 --> 00:56:20,987
Do you know,
I can still remember
the day you were born.

634
00:56:23,106 --> 00:56:25,920
I was 11 years old.

635
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:31,068
And you,
this helpless bundle.

636
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:32,958
I looked at you
in your crib,

637
00:56:33,025 --> 00:56:36,059
with your little,
wrinkled face,

638
00:56:36,128 --> 00:56:38,365
and I loved you
from the first.

639
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:42,806
I've failed you,
haven't I?

640
00:56:43,873 --> 00:56:47,003
Forgive me
if I haven't
loved you enough.

641
00:56:56,929 --> 00:56:59,831
Did you imagine
I wouldn't know?

642
00:57:05,601 --> 00:57:07,967
Your blessing,
Majesty. My little one.

643
00:57:08,032 --> 00:57:09,592
Your blessing?

644
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:20,123
Walk on.

645
00:57:36,351 --> 00:57:39,034
The Queen is at her prayers.

646
00:57:47,807 --> 00:57:49,432
Go!

647
00:57:50,431 --> 00:57:54,740
Elizabeth is a whore!
Mary Stuart is our
true queen!

648
00:57:56,766 --> 00:57:59,132
Elizabeth!

649
00:58:01,887 --> 00:58:03,927
Whore!

650
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:13,813
You bring news?

651
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:20,561
The Queen
has been attacked.

652
00:59:22,364 --> 00:59:24,949
The assassin seized.

653
00:59:29,788 --> 00:59:31,193
The Queen

654
00:59:33,244 --> 00:59:34,804
unharmed.

655
00:59:35,994 --> 00:59:36,976
Unharmed?

656
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:42,070
And you, ma'am,
are to be tried
for treason.

657
00:59:48,155 --> 00:59:49,978
Me?

658
00:59:51,931 --> 00:59:55,246
What has any of this
to do with me?

659
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:04,050
That's the trouble
with intrigues, isn't it?

660
01:00:04,123 --> 01:00:05,235
With so many secrets,

661
01:00:05,306 --> 01:00:08,818
you can never quite be sure
who's on whose side
till the game ends.

662
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:20,762
Walsingham has every
letter you've written.

663
01:00:25,273 --> 01:00:27,096
Traitor.

664
01:00:33,336 --> 01:00:35,759
Traitors!

665
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,967
Ready to die,
I see, Jesuit.

666
01:01:15,032 --> 01:01:17,300
I have done what
I was sent to do.

667
01:01:18,615 --> 01:01:20,949
Why was the gun
not loaded?

668
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,916
I need your help.

669
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:47,469
I, too,
have failed, brother.

670
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,135
What was the Jesuit
sent to do?

671
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:52,817
I told you everything I know.

672
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:55,635
So kill me.

673
01:01:57,911 --> 01:02:00,561
There's a better world
waiting for me.

674
01:02:03,574 --> 01:02:06,291
We'll all be judged
in the end, brother.

675
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:09,197
Even you.

676
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:13,389
William, you're
not a martyr.

677
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:17,492
You weren't even
much of a murderer.

678
01:02:21,974 --> 01:02:24,592
I'm going to have you
taken to France.

679
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:28,309
No one will know.

680
01:02:29,782 --> 01:02:32,563
You must never let me
hear of you again.

681
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,387
Francis.

682
01:02:38,452 --> 01:02:39,914
Francis!

683
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,614
Francis.

684
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:46,065
I've never seen her
so distressed.

685
01:02:46,132 --> 01:02:49,481
She's been alone
in her room since morning.
She'll see no one.

686
01:02:49,556 --> 01:02:50,603
Has she asked for me?

687
01:02:50,677 --> 01:02:51,724
No.

688
01:02:51,797 --> 01:02:54,130
But she needs you.
I know she does.

689
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,382
Go to her.

690
01:02:58,452 --> 01:03:01,005
Please.

691
01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:22,318
Are you here
to tell me I must
murder a queen?

692
01:03:23,251 --> 01:03:26,480
I would
never presume to tell
my Queen what to do.

693
01:03:26,612 --> 01:03:28,978
Only you know
where your duty lies.

694
01:03:32,628 --> 01:03:35,661
Was it my father's duty
to murder my mother?

695
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:39,817
She was a queen
for a time.

696
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:44,873
Oh, I would be
loath to die
so bloody a death.

697
01:03:48,818 --> 01:03:51,601
Since when were you
so afraid?

698
01:03:54,994 --> 01:03:57,099
I'm always afraid.

699
01:03:59,186 --> 01:04:02,634
Kill a queen,
and all queens are mortal.

700
01:04:07,795 --> 01:04:10,728
We mortals have
many weaknesses.

701
01:04:10,802 --> 01:04:12,710
We feel too much.

702
01:04:12,786 --> 01:04:15,023
Hurt too much.

703
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:17,936
All too soon we die.

704
01:04:18,865 --> 01:04:22,161
But we do have
the chance of love.

705
01:04:26,769 --> 01:04:28,657
Do we?

706
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,664
I have given
England my life.

707
01:04:39,664 --> 01:04:42,664
Must she also
have my soul?

708
01:04:43,056 --> 01:04:45,097
<i>Mary Stuart must die!</i>

709
01:04:45,264 --> 01:04:48,527
Must? Mary Stuart must die?

710
01:04:48,592 --> 01:04:51,724
Where is it written?
Who says so?
Have I ordered it?

711
01:04:51,793 --> 01:04:54,313
Majesty, this is
no time for mercy.

712
01:04:54,385 --> 01:04:56,653
Don't preach at me,
old man!

713
01:04:57,809 --> 01:05:00,460
Look at you.
You can hardly stand.

714
01:05:02,353 --> 01:05:05,255
Go home to your wife
and your bed.

715
01:05:06,576 --> 01:05:09,641
The law must
have its way.

716
01:05:11,856 --> 01:05:15,204
By whose authority
do you condemn me?

717
01:05:16,143 --> 01:05:18,119
God is my only judge.

718
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:23,021
The law
is for common men.
Not for princes.

719
01:05:24,047 --> 01:05:28,717
The law, Your Majesty,
is for the protection
of your people.

720
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,315
Leave me.

721
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:45,192
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

722
01:05:52,143 --> 01:05:57,610
<i>You know
neither who you are
or what you do.</i>

723
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:01,833
I know who I am.

724
01:06:01,902 --> 01:06:06,277
And if I die,
it shall be
as I have lived.

725
01:06:08,686 --> 01:06:11,108
As a queen,

726
01:06:11,182 --> 01:06:16,135
trusting in the mercy
of God, my Father.

727
01:06:55,403 --> 01:06:57,641
At which hour?

728
01:06:57,708 --> 01:06:58,690
At 8:00.

729
01:07:00,652 --> 01:07:02,724
Tomorrow morning.

730
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:07,302
It must be stopped!

731
01:08:08,777 --> 01:08:10,753
I want it stopped!

732
01:09:05,576 --> 01:09:08,872
I forgive you
with all my heart.

733
01:11:16,804 --> 01:11:18,943
<i>Forgive me, Majesty.</i>

734
01:11:20,868 --> 01:11:23,354
I have failed you.

735
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:26,338
How have you failed me?

736
01:11:26,756 --> 01:11:28,610
What am I
to forgive you for?

737
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:30,563
Philip of Spain
is a God-fearing man

738
01:11:30,627 --> 01:11:33,442
who cannot declare war
without a just cause.

739
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:38,876
I intercepted
every letter Mary Stuart
secretly dispatched,

740
01:11:40,323 --> 01:11:44,381
but failed to see that Spain
knew I was reading them.

741
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,905
They waited for her
to write the words

742
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,319
that would, in my eyes,
confirm her treason.

743
01:11:52,962 --> 01:11:55,134
Forgive me.

744
01:11:55,203 --> 01:11:57,886
I am trapped
in my own web.

745
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:03,606
And I ordered
Mary's execution.

746
01:12:05,345 --> 01:12:09,176
I murdered God's
anointed Queen.

747
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:16,381
And now God's most dutiful son
makes holy war to punish me.

748
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,851
We are at war.

749
01:12:49,921 --> 01:12:53,020
Who knows when
we will meet again?

750
01:12:53,345 --> 01:12:55,734
If we will meet again.

751
01:12:57,216 --> 01:13:02,136
If England falls,
my last days will be
in a Spanish prison.

752
01:13:03,391 --> 01:13:05,880
To die far from home.

753
01:13:05,952 --> 01:13:07,545
That is the
loneliest death.

754
01:13:07,615 --> 01:13:09,208
Never.

755
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,622
My thoughts
turn dark.

756
01:13:17,631 --> 01:13:19,573
What do you do
in a storm

757
01:13:19,648 --> 01:13:21,470
when you're facing
your death?

758
01:13:22,878 --> 01:13:25,268
The closer
I come to death,

759
01:13:25,376 --> 01:13:27,382
the more
I want to live,

760
01:13:27,456 --> 01:13:29,789
the hungrier
I am for life.

761
01:13:29,854 --> 01:13:34,078
Yes. To live
right to the end.

762
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,631
Why be afraid
of tomorrow when today
is all we have?

763
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:38,492
I wish...

764
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:43,449
I have never known
a woman like you.

765
01:13:46,686 --> 01:13:50,614
In some other world,
in some other time,

766
01:13:52,734 --> 01:13:55,515
could you have
loved me?

767
01:13:56,511 --> 01:13:59,228
I know only
one world.

768
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:03,802
And in this world,
I have loved you.

769
01:14:10,622 --> 01:14:14,135
There's something
you could do for me,

770
01:14:15,677 --> 01:14:20,761
something I
have not known
for a very long time.

771
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:26,229
If you felt
so inclined.

772
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,682
But it's not to be
spoken of afterward.

773
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:34,780
It must be forgotten.

774
01:14:36,412 --> 01:14:38,747
But just for now...

775
01:14:41,885 --> 01:14:43,511
A kiss?

776
01:15:17,115 --> 01:15:18,543
I die.

777
01:15:40,538 --> 01:15:41,520
I've given
Drake the orders

778
01:15:41,595 --> 01:15:43,154
to prepare the fleet
to defend the Channel.

779
01:15:43,226 --> 01:15:44,536
How soon can you
join him?

780
01:15:44,603 --> 01:15:47,351
We're waiting for supplies.
We can move as soon
as we're ready and armed.

781
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:48,498
Good.

782
01:15:52,377 --> 01:15:53,720
Bess.

783
01:15:54,395 --> 01:15:56,599
I have something
to tell you.

784
01:15:57,177 --> 01:16:00,277
I ask for nothing.
Is that understood?

785
01:16:02,011 --> 01:16:04,563
Your life is your own.
Nothing will change.

786
01:16:04,634 --> 01:16:06,260
What is this?

787
01:16:09,305 --> 01:16:11,444
I am...
You're with child.

788
01:16:12,217 --> 01:16:15,447
No one knows.
My plans are made.

789
01:16:15,514 --> 01:16:18,164
I shall ask the Queen
for permission
to leave court.

790
01:16:18,234 --> 01:16:19,280
Where will you go?

791
01:16:19,354 --> 01:16:21,493
To my
mother's house.

792
01:16:21,561 --> 01:16:24,114
I'm a ward of the Queen.
I can't court a man
without her permission.

793
01:16:24,185 --> 01:16:26,193
I can't marry
without her permission.

794
01:16:26,265 --> 01:16:28,983
As for having a child,

795
01:16:29,817 --> 01:16:31,377
your child...

796
01:16:33,081 --> 01:16:36,823
All I know
is nothing's as it should be.

797
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,546
Please, listen.

798
01:16:38,649 --> 01:16:41,715
You once said to me,
"Whatever I have to give,
ask and it's yours."

799
01:16:41,784 --> 01:16:42,734
Do you remember?

800
01:16:42,809 --> 01:16:44,238
Of course, I remember.

801
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:46,136
I ask that you
forget me.

802
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:49,582
Go to your ship.
Do your duty.

803
01:16:49,657 --> 01:16:51,926
Forget me.
Bess!

804
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,326
We're summoned.
Coming.

805
01:17:02,488 --> 01:17:07,954
This Spanish Armada
is at sea with an army
of 10,000 men?

806
01:17:08,024 --> 01:17:10,444
And Philip's friend,
the Duke of Parma,

807
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,716
has 15,000 men
on the French coast.

808
01:17:14,775 --> 01:17:18,421
They plan to cross
the Channel in barges
and sail into the Thames.

809
01:17:18,488 --> 01:17:21,007
They don't have
enough barges yet.
We have a little time.

810
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:25,837
And our forces
defend the mouth of
the Thames at Tilbury with...

811
01:17:25,911 --> 01:17:29,773
What? How...
Four thousand men?

812
01:17:30,262 --> 01:17:33,524
Three thousand.
Possibly.

813
01:17:33,591 --> 01:17:35,893
If the Spanish fleet
unites the barges,

814
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:38,326
their combined strength
will overwhelm us.

815
01:17:39,542 --> 01:17:42,356
Then we shall
engage them at sea,

816
01:17:42,422 --> 01:17:44,560
before they have
the chance to unite.

817
01:17:44,983 --> 01:17:46,356
Your Majesty,

818
01:17:46,422 --> 01:17:50,765
this vast Armada
will surely smash through
our naval defenses

819
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:52,365
and overrun
us on land.

820
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,597
We must prepare
for the worst.

821
01:18:34,997 --> 01:18:37,136
I need air.

822
01:18:38,356 --> 01:18:40,212
<i>With this ring,
I thee wed.</i>

823
01:18:40,277 --> 01:18:42,862
<i>With this ring,
I thee wed.</i>

824
01:18:42,932 --> 01:18:45,868
<i>With my body,
I thee worship.</i>

825
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:49,202
<i>With my body,
I thee worship.</i>

826
01:18:49,268 --> 01:18:52,399
And with all
my worldly goods,
I thee endow.

827
01:18:52,469 --> 01:18:56,079
And with all
my worldly goods,
I thee endow.

828
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,864
In the name
of the Father

829
01:18:58,931 --> 01:19:04,399
and of the Son,
and of the
Holy Ghost, amen.

830
01:19:09,171 --> 01:19:11,725
Bess!

831
01:19:13,939 --> 01:19:16,328
Bess!

832
01:19:16,404 --> 01:19:19,337
Bess Throckmorton!

833
01:19:24,115 --> 01:19:25,806
Here, my lady.

834
01:19:25,876 --> 01:19:28,210
Tell me,
is it true?

835
01:19:28,274 --> 01:19:30,926
Are you with child?

836
01:19:31,762 --> 01:19:33,618
Are you with child?

837
01:19:33,842 --> 01:19:36,331
Yes, my lady.

838
01:19:36,403 --> 01:19:38,770
You traitress.

839
01:19:38,835 --> 01:19:41,168
You dare to keep
secrets from me?

840
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:43,984
You ask my permission
before you rut!

841
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:45,195
Before you breed!

842
01:19:45,266 --> 01:19:48,364
My bitches
wear my collars!
Do you hear me?

843
01:19:48,434 --> 01:19:49,743
Do you hear me?

844
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:52,810
Majesty! Please,
dignity. Mercy.

845
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:55,086
This is no time
for mercy, Walsingham.

846
01:19:55,154 --> 01:19:56,332
You go to your
traitor brother

847
01:19:56,403 --> 01:19:58,606
and leave me
to my business.

848
01:19:58,675 --> 01:20:00,583
Is it his?

849
01:20:00,658 --> 01:20:04,039
Tell me. Say it.
Is the child his?
Is it his?

850
01:20:04,113 --> 01:20:06,024
Yes.

851
01:20:06,097 --> 01:20:10,985
My lady, it is
my husband's child.

852
01:20:13,488 --> 01:20:14,951
You bitch!

853
01:20:15,025 --> 01:20:16,586
Majesty.

854
01:20:17,585 --> 01:20:20,846
This is not the Queen
I love and serve.

855
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:29,104
This man has seduced
a ward of the Queen.

856
01:20:29,168 --> 01:20:32,649
And she has married
without royal consent.

857
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:36,582
These offenses
are punishable by law.
Arrest him!

858
01:20:36,657 --> 01:20:38,545
Go!

859
01:20:43,056 --> 01:20:46,439
You no longer have
the Queen's protection.

860
01:20:46,512 --> 01:20:49,065
As you wish,
Majesty.

861
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:50,445
Get out.

862
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,359
Get out! Get out!

863
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:59,622
Get out!

864
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:26,189
The fall of an empire,
you told me.

865
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:27,815
Did you mean
the English empire?

866
01:21:27,886 --> 01:21:30,985
Because, by God,
England will not fall
while I am Queen.

867
01:21:31,055 --> 01:21:33,421
If that is
your prophecy, sir,
you prophesy again.

868
01:21:33,487 --> 01:21:34,916
You want me to tell
Your Majesty

869
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,713
only what Your Majesty
chooses to hear.

870
01:21:36,783 --> 01:21:38,987
I will not be a toy
of the fates!

871
01:21:39,055 --> 01:21:41,738
Have I not faced
an assassin's bullet
and lived?

872
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:48,359
Just tell me
there's no certainty.

873
01:21:49,645 --> 01:21:50,954
That any outcome
is possible.

874
01:21:51,023 --> 01:21:54,121
The shadow of ghosts,
you said.

875
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:58,060
Please, just
give me hope.

876
01:21:58,126 --> 01:22:01,605
The forces that shape
our world are greater
than all of us, Majesty.

877
01:22:01,677 --> 01:22:05,158
How can I promise
that they'll conspire
in your favor,

878
01:22:05,229 --> 01:22:07,335
even though
you are the Queen?

879
01:22:10,094 --> 01:22:12,712
But this much
I know.

880
01:22:12,782 --> 01:22:18,497
When the storm breaks,
each man acts in accordance
with his own nature.

881
01:22:18,573 --> 01:22:20,994
Some are dumb
with terror.

882
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:24,233
Some flee. Some hide.

883
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:27,018
And some

884
01:22:27,085 --> 01:22:31,460
spread their wings
like eagles and soar
on the wind.

885
01:22:38,604 --> 01:22:41,801
You are a wise man,
Dr. Dee.

886
01:22:41,868 --> 01:22:44,935
And you, madam,
are a very great lady.

887
01:22:51,149 --> 01:22:53,604
Light the beacon!

888
01:23:43,113 --> 01:23:45,024
My lords,

889
01:23:46,059 --> 01:23:49,221
I can offer you
no words of comfort.

890
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:53,895
This Armada
that sails against us,

891
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:57,257
carries in its bowels
the Inquisition.

892
01:23:57,322 --> 01:23:59,743
God forbid it succeeds,

893
01:23:59,818 --> 01:24:03,135
for then there will be
no more liberty in England

894
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,762
of conscience or of thought.

895
01:24:08,297 --> 01:24:11,145
We cannot be defeated.

896
01:24:12,234 --> 01:24:14,851
The bells are to ring
from every tower.

897
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:18,751
Laborers are to
leave the fields,
and take up arms.

898
01:24:18,826 --> 01:24:20,801
The harvest must wait.

899
01:24:22,154 --> 01:24:26,244
All prisoners
are to be released.

900
01:24:27,113 --> 01:24:29,414
England is their country, too.

901
01:24:45,577 --> 01:24:48,576
And release Raleigh.

902
01:24:51,976 --> 01:24:54,398
He is forgiven.

903
01:24:57,159 --> 01:24:59,396
As I, too,
long to be forgiven.

904
01:25:06,631 --> 01:25:10,046
Let the fleet know
we're on our way,
Mr. Calley!

905
01:25:10,984 --> 01:25:13,634
Fire broadside
from the bow!

906
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:16,797
Run out the prime!

907
01:25:17,127 --> 01:25:20,356
From the starboard bow,
number one gun!

908
01:25:20,423 --> 01:25:22,912
On my mark!

909
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:24,957
Discharge! Two!

910
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:28,260
Three! Four!

911
01:25:52,326 --> 01:25:55,740
Majesty, the enemy
has been engaged.

912
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:58,139
What news?

913
01:25:58,215 --> 01:26:01,313
A brave action,
Your Majesty.

914
01:26:01,381 --> 01:26:03,237
Two ships lost.

915
01:26:03,301 --> 01:26:04,895
With what gain?

916
01:26:04,966 --> 01:26:07,387
The enemy continue
to advance.

917
01:26:15,109 --> 01:26:18,176
Tighten the buntlines
on the foresail!

918
01:26:19,237 --> 01:26:21,310
Another four
ships lost.

919
01:26:21,445 --> 01:26:24,761
We must continue
to engage and harass
the enemy.

920
01:26:25,797 --> 01:26:29,506
We're outgunned,
Drake. Decisively.

921
01:26:30,788 --> 01:26:35,067
We're losing too many ships.
We must fall back
and defend the coast.

922
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:38,431
If the wind
is with us, Walter,

923
01:26:38,501 --> 01:26:40,387
we can attack them
with fire ships.

924
01:26:40,453 --> 01:26:43,268
Six fire ships
into the Spanish formation,

925
01:26:43,332 --> 01:26:45,088
that may force
them to scatter.

926
01:26:45,155 --> 01:26:46,782
We can't get
anywhere near them.

927
01:26:46,853 --> 01:26:49,984
We have to break
their formation.
That's our only chance.

928
01:26:53,029 --> 01:26:55,449
The Spanish
are barely
a day away, Majesty.

929
01:26:55,524 --> 01:26:58,077
We must withdraw
to safe ground.

930
01:26:58,148 --> 01:27:03,449
I beg you to appreciate
the gravity of the situation.
There is very little time.

931
01:27:38,243 --> 01:27:41,210
My loving people.

932
01:27:43,682 --> 01:27:46,399
We see the sails
of the enemy approaching.

933
01:27:47,682 --> 01:27:51,228
We hear the Spanish guns
over the water.

934
01:27:52,865 --> 01:27:58,136
Soon now,
we will meet them
face to face.

935
01:28:00,514 --> 01:28:03,416
I am resolved in the midst
and heat of the battle

936
01:28:03,489 --> 01:28:07,002
to live or die
amongst you all!

937
01:28:10,913 --> 01:28:16,095
While we stand together,
no invader shall pass.

938
01:28:16,161 --> 01:28:19,871
Let them come
with the armies of hell!
They will not pass!

939
01:28:22,337 --> 01:28:25,752
And when this day
of battle is ended,

940
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:29,408
we meet again in heaven

941
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:34,489
or on the field of victory.

942
01:29:16,543 --> 01:29:19,478
Thomas! Get up!
Get up, man! Get up!

943
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,042
Help me!
Somebody, help me!

944
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,998
Help me!

945
01:30:14,622 --> 01:30:16,247
They've dropped anchor.

946
01:30:16,318 --> 01:30:19,317
These Spanish monsters
can't handle
our English seas.

947
01:30:20,157 --> 01:30:23,190
We have the wind
in our favor.

948
01:30:23,261 --> 01:30:24,822
Do we go?

949
01:30:27,324 --> 01:30:29,212
We go.

950
01:30:29,693 --> 01:30:31,699
Godspeed, my friend.

951
01:30:33,853 --> 01:30:35,511
Walter?

952
01:30:35,581 --> 01:30:37,369
Don't forget to jump.

953
01:30:52,668 --> 01:30:54,293
Calley!

954
01:30:54,395 --> 01:30:56,916
Enough tar!
Clear the deck!

955
01:30:57,948 --> 01:31:00,631
If that cannon's primed,
set the fuse!

956
01:31:03,228 --> 01:31:06,904
Get everybody
off the ship, now!

957
01:31:11,578 --> 01:31:13,587
Get off the ship!
Off the ship!
Go!

958
01:31:13,659 --> 01:31:15,863
Get over there!

959
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:18,418
Come on, boys!
Get going!

960
01:32:12,634 --> 01:32:14,520
The Spanish
continue to advance.

961
01:32:14,585 --> 01:32:16,920
Just five of their ships
are burning.

962
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:23,060
Not enough.

963
01:36:37,136 --> 01:36:39,307
Amen.

964
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:42,820
Francis?

965
01:38:00,942 --> 01:38:05,829
I have served Your Majesty
in all things.

966
01:38:07,596 --> 01:38:09,604
I know it.

967
01:38:11,885 --> 01:38:14,601
You won't need me anymore.

968
01:38:27,628 --> 01:38:29,538
You rest here,

969
01:38:33,645 --> 01:38:35,434
old friend.

970
01:39:12,747 --> 01:39:15,465
Elizabeth has a son.

971
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:20,037
You must be proud.

972
01:39:20,106 --> 01:39:21,929
Very.

973
01:39:21,994 --> 01:39:24,449
And fulfilled.

974
01:39:24,523 --> 01:39:27,011
As any man can be.

975
01:39:28,234 --> 01:39:32,577
Do you still dream
of your shining city
in the New World?

976
01:39:33,802 --> 01:39:35,591
Always.

977
01:39:57,770 --> 01:40:00,737
I'd like to give
your son my blessing.

978
01:40:01,962 --> 01:40:03,872
I'd be honored.

979
01:41:04,072 --> 01:41:07,006
<i>I am called
the Virgin Queen.</i>

980
01:41:08,519 --> 01:41:10,623
<i>Unmarried,</i>

981
01:41:10,694 --> 01:41:13,182
<i>I have no master.</i>

982
01:41:14,311 --> 01:41:16,581
<i>Childless,</i>

983
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:20,257
<i>I am mother to my people.</i>

984
01:41:20,871 --> 01:41:26,020
<i>God give me strength
to bear this mighty freedom.</i>

985
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:31,395
<i>I am your Queen.</i>

986
01:41:32,903 --> 01:41:35,586
<i>I am myself.</i>

987
01:42:04,161 --> 01:42:09,359
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]

988
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,104
