1
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:17,493
Grab it, Lu.

2
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:20,496
Give me that stick.

3
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:26,211
Drop.

4
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:29,905
Drop.

5
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:34,218
Drop it. That's a girl.
That's a girl.

6
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:07,710
Drop it. Good dog.

7
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:39,033
Lucy.

8
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:04,058
Come on back, girl.

9
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,852
Lu, where did you go?

10
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:46,361
Great dog, what's her name?

11
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:47,528
Lucy.

12
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,530
You're a sweetheart, Lucy!

13
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:51,032
What is she?

14
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:55,961
Don't know, really. A mix of
hunting dog and retriever.

15
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:59,423
Where's the closest
store around here?

16
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,336
I don't know. I'm not
from around here.

17
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,713
I'm just kinda passing through.

18
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:07,215
Where to?

19
00:05:07,216 --> 00:05:09,808
Going to Alaska.

20
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:11,977
I'm headed south.

21
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:16,391
Icky over there worked
the canneries last year.

22
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:19,276
Hey, Icky! This lady's
going to Alaska!

23
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,981
King Salmon!

24
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:25,984
It's fucking awesome up there.
You going to work?

25
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:28,236
Where you going?

26
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:31,830
Ketchikan.

27
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,576
It's good for greenhorns. Cooper River
is pretty good, too. Further north.

28
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:38,121
Lots of work on that slime line.

29
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:40,282
You should check out
Northwestern Fisheries

30
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:43,126
because their housing
is fucking awesome.

31
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:47,888
Tell Mike Murphy you met me,
because he's all right.

32
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:50,425
Okay, I might. Thanks.

33
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:52,719
The money's better there, too.

34
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,480
There's no expenses, you know?
You just walk with everything.

35
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,100
Well, whatever you do...

36
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:02,478
don't tell Old Man
Brutus that you met me.

37
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,275
Because he was a little upset when
I left in somewhat of a hurry.

38
00:06:07,276 --> 00:06:08,735
There was this incident...

39
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:12,613
involving me operating a
two-ton earth mover...

40
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:15,916
in a state slightly
less than sober.

41
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:18,453
Some friends of mine...

42
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:19,996
they were goofing around...

43
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:24,292
and we got the thing started, and
I put it in gear and that was that.

44
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:27,295
We drove the thing across
the construction site.

45
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:31,174
Getting it to stop, though.
No one told me that.

46
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:32,759
So, we finally had to jump off...

47
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,511
and the thing just rolled all the
way across the construction site.

48
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:38,139
We couldn't stop the thing.
We tried everything.

49
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,309
It snapped the retaining wires.

50
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,144
Huge spray of sparks.

51
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:46,314
The Cat went over the
hill head over heels...

52
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:48,524
ass over tit, right into the water.

53
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,604
It was probably a hundred
thousand-dollar piece of equipment,

54
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:52,612
gone in four fucking seconds.

55
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,831
But they couldn't pin it
on me, man, I was gone.

56
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:14,868
Good night, baby girl.

57
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,366
Wake up.

58
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,208
Ma'am.

59
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:13,135
You can't sleep here, ma'am.

60
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:14,879
You can't sleep out
here, it's not allowed.

61
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,097
Okay.

62
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:20,642
All right, get back, Lu.

63
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,493
My car won't start.

64
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:47,502
I can hear that.

65
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,665
You can't park here.
That's the rules.

66
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:54,092
Yeah, I got it, I got it, okay?

67
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:59,882
I don't know what it is.
It was fine yesterday.

68
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:03,351
You just gonna have to
get it off the property.

69
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:08,933
Well, where is that?
How far is the property?

70
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:13,153
Street. The street's public. You
just have to get it off the lot.

71
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,287
All right, jump in.

72
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,972
Lu!

73
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,725
What do you know about that...

74
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:52,727
station over there?

75
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:55,688
Seems to get business.
A lot of cars come and go.

76
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,573
He's the closest. He's
got that going for him.

77
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:02,320
What about, is there some kind
of grocery store around here?

78
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:04,322
Down the road there's Jack's.

79
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:08,500
Pretty good and pretty cheap.
That's where I normally go.

80
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:15,215
Stay, Lu.

81
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,325
Hey, Lu.

82
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:12,540
Look.

83
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:38,942
I know.

84
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,965
Okay. Be right back.

85
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,797
You're hungry, huh? Bet you are.

86
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,265
Come on, let's go.

87
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,658
I can't shut up, I'm choking.

88
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,044
So I said, man, I ain't
staying there, I'm going.

89
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:09,168
Yeah, like one out of what?
Is there like ten of us here?

90
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:13,255
Found a few cans and then I
went to this place over here...

91
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,674
and laid down under a
tree and went to sleep.

92
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,392
Lu.

93
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:18,677
Sit here.

94
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,304
There's a long line.

95
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:24,683
I think some of these machines are
broken today, so it's gonna be a while.

96
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,226
Why don't you buy
her cans from her?

97
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:28,854
I don't have any money to
buy her cans from her.

98
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,358
But, hey, I tell you what,
I'll take those. Hey, dog.

99
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:36,828
I'll take those from you and
I'll give you the money later.

100
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:40,623
I mean, you've only got....

101
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:45,204
It's not many cans.
It's not worth the wait.

102
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,039
I'll find you later.

103
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,875
Okay, you can just take
those. That's fine.

104
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,044
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, that's fine.

105
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,088
Hey, thanks. Thanks a lot.

106
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:56,598
Yeah. That's pretty cool.

107
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,393
Don't bother anybody, okay?

108
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,897
Be right back with a treat.

109
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,401
Hey.

110
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:11,404
What did I say?

111
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:18,912
Don't be a nuisance.
We don't need that.

112
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,896
Hey, Lu.

113
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:18,899
- Excuse me? Ma'am?
- Let go of me.

114
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,777
- I think you're forgetting something.
- Let go of me.

115
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:24,238
- But you have something.
- Let go of me.

116
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:28,541
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step inside the store, okay?

117
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:36,041
Sit here, please.

118
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,918
What's going on, Andy?

119
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,263
This customer neglected
to pay for a few items.

120
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,559
I watched the whole thing. I saw
her since she came in the store.

121
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:48,512
No. I'm sorry, that isn't true.

122
00:19:48,513 --> 00:19:51,105
Okay, well, what are
we talking about here?

123
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,983
Excuse me.

124
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:03,242
Sir, I wasn't done shopping yet.

125
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:08,240
I walked out of the door by accident
without paying for those cans...

126
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:12,077
because I was going to check on my dog.
My dog is tied up in front of the store.

127
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,246
Mr. Hunt, it was obvious
what was going on here.

128
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:17,207
Sir, your employee
has the wrong idea.

129
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,176
The rules apply to
everyone equally.

130
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:31,096
If a person can't afford dog
food they shouldn't have a dog.

131
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,980
Andy.

132
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,561
Sir, I just made a mistake
is all. I'm very sorry.

133
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:40,105
This isn't gonna happen again.
I'm really very sorry.

134
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,942
The food is not the issue. It's
about setting an example, right?

135
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:47,745
I'm not from around here,
sir, I can't be an example.

136
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,290
We have a policy, ma'am.

137
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,059
Hi, this is Andy Mooney
from Jack's on Lombard.

138
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:33,332
Sir, my dog is tied up out front.

139
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:39,213
- Sir, my dog is tied up outside.
- Just relax.

140
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:44,177
Face forward.

141
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:52,059
Left. Turn to your left.

142
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,634
Can I get my bag back?

143
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:16,894
Not yet.

144
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:23,860
This machine's gonna kill me.

145
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,195
We've got to do this again.

146
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:30,032
Okay.

147
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:08,321
Fifty dollars.

148
00:24:09,524 --> 00:24:11,483
Excuse me?

149
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:14,480
You can pay your fine now or
you can come back in two weeks

150
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:19,832
for a trial with a judge. Then you can
pay the 50 dollars plus court fees.

151
00:24:21,536 --> 00:24:25,038
I don't live here. I'm
just passing through.

152
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,800
If you get stopped in another state
you're just gonna end up right back here.

153
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:34,221
You could use a credit card.

154
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:46,275
Cash.

Lucy!

162
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,390
Lu!

163
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:04,311
Has anyone seen a dog?

164
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:09,184
Excuse me. Has anyone seen a dog?
She was tied out front this morning.

165
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:11,102
Yellow-gold.

166
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,946
You mean like a German
Shepherd or something?

167
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:18,159
Medium sized, yellow-gold in color.

168
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:21,780
I kind of remember seeing
a white van take a dog.

169
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,865
You do? What time was that?

170
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:25,659
Around noon?

171
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,662
Noon? You didn't even
start work until two.

172
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:30,163
Could have been later.

173
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:32,791
Excuse me, a white
van, like a city van?

174
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,210
I don't know. I could
be totally wrong.

175
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:37,428
She didn't see anything.

176
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,847
Lucy!

177
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:44,351
Lu!

178
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:54,195
Lucy!

179
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,399
Come here, Lu!

180
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,533
Lucy!

181
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:06,540
Lucy, come out now!

182
00:27:07,702 --> 00:27:10,211
What are you doing here?

183
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:14,215
Looking for my dog. She's gone.
I hope you're real happy.

184
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,551
Lucy, come!

185
00:27:35,896 --> 00:27:37,696
Lucy!

186
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:46,122
Come on, girl. Come on
out, girl! Come on, Lu!

187
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:51,001
Yeah, have a great night, okay?

188
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:59,009
You know, your son is a real hero!

189
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:01,212
Lucy!

190
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,556
Come now!

191
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:10,271
Lucy!

192
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:57,484
Have you seen my dog?

193
00:28:57,895 --> 00:29:01,071
Not since I saw you. Nope.

194
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:05,618
Is that fucking garage ever open?

195
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,458
Most days. Yep.

196
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:23,219
Is there a pound around here?
There's gotta be a pound close by, huh?

197
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:26,013
Not too far.

198
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,515
You all right, honey?

199
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:33,555
Yeah. I just need to
get to the pound now.

200
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:35,640
Well, that's easy.

201
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,893
You just take the
street right here.

202
00:29:38,894 --> 00:29:43,648
Go straight down till it
dead ends that way about...

203
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,701
just right till it dead ends, then
you head right about three miles.

204
00:29:48,404 --> 00:29:50,488
You lose your dog, is that it?

205
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,248
Yeah...

206
00:29:54,076 --> 00:29:55,785
that's what it looks like.

207
00:29:55,786 --> 00:29:59,129
That's a shame.
Somewhere around here?

208
00:29:59,373 --> 00:30:01,082
Yeah, that store.

209
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,293
Jack's?

210
00:30:03,294 --> 00:30:05,636
I'm sure someone's got her.

211
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:08,506
She couldn't have gotten too far.

212
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,758
I was gone kind of a long time.

213
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:15,145
I'm sure it wasn't that
long. She'll turn up.

214
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:20,484
Okay.

215
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:30,612
So I just go down this street,
and then I take a right?

216
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:34,532
I'm pretty sure it's closed now. You'll
probably have to wait until morning.

217
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,951
But you know, you can get the number
four right here on the corner.

218
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:39,954
It will take you right there.
Starts at six a.m.

219
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:42,840
I think I'm just gonna
head there now.

220
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,762
It's definitely closed.

221
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,348
Well, fucking Christ!

222
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:56,638
Well, if she's there she'll be
there in the morning, won't she?

223
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:59,898
A night in the pound
never hurt anyone.

224
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:07,690
You know, there's a good hotel
down the road. The Palms.

225
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,659
Really good clean rooms.

226
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:18,250
If I see anything
I'll let you know.

227
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:29,712
Hello?

228
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,805
Hey, Dan.

229
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:35,934
Wendy? Hold on, let
me turn down the TV.

230
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:40,898
Where are you?

231
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:43,901
In Oregon.

232
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:46,362
Raining?

233
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:50,157
Yeah, kind of, sort of. On and off.

234
00:31:51,026 --> 00:31:53,202
So what's up?

235
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:59,541
Nothing. I'm just calling.
Just, you know, just...

236
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:02,711
Nothing?

237
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:07,299
The car broke.

238
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:11,970
I don't know. It's kind
of bad here, actually.

239
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:16,600
Lucy's lost.

240
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,553
Who's that?

241
00:32:18,554 --> 00:32:20,972
It's your sister. She
broke down in Oregon.

242
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,940
Hi Deb.

243
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:26,402
Oregon? What does she
want us to do about it?

244
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:30,732
Nothing. I'm just calling.

245
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,950
She's just calling.

246
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:36,529
We can't do anything. We're strapped.
I don't know what she wants.

247
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,823
I don't want anything.
I'm just calling.

248
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,950
I can't talk with
everyone on the phone.

249
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:45,254
I'll talk to you when you're
done with Dan. Bye, honey.

250
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:48,257
Everything's all right?

251
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:51,009
Yeah. Everything's great.

252
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:55,965
You kind of sound like you're busy over
there, so I'm gonna call you later.

253
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:58,801
All right, if everything's
fine. See ya.

254
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:00,894
Yeah, see ya, bye.

255
00:33:57,194 --> 00:33:59,369
Lu!

256
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,961
Luce!

257
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,851
I was usually like the
only white person there.

258
00:34:24,012 --> 00:34:25,263
That's so weird.

259
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,889
Why does that girl
hate you so much?

260
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:32,402
I saw the cheerleading squad.
Madison's got some chunky cheerleaders.

261
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,031
Dude, fuck, there's
a lady in there!

262
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:37,900
Your mom's always tired.

263
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:40,994
Yeah, my mom's like,
always, always....

264
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,550
Just a minute!

265
00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:16,647
Good morning. Hello, Amy.

266
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,407
Hello, Mike.

267
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,610
What is going on with the traffic?

268
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:25,156
Well, we have activity on Northeast 53rd
Avenue between Gleason and Irving...

269
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:27,124
so it is closed.

270
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:54,727
She's medium sized.

271
00:35:54,728 --> 00:35:56,437
39 pounds.

272
00:35:56,438 --> 00:36:00,574
Yellow-gold in colour.
Her name is Lucy.

273
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:04,195
I left her tied up to a post and then
when I got back she wasn't there anymore.

274
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:07,698
Well, I don't see anything
here that matches.

275
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:12,669
But come on, let's go take a look in the
back. You never know. Okay? Follow me.

276
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:24,598
Okay, so you can go right
around the corner here.

277
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,765
Okay, no address?

278
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,468
And no phone either?

279
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:36,188
No. I mean, no, not right now.

280
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:41,026
I'm just passing through.

281
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:43,820
Do you have a previous address?

282
00:38:44,564 --> 00:38:47,525
My sister and her
husband. They live at...

283
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:52,329
East, 73 East Jackson...

284
00:38:52,447 --> 00:38:57,334
Muncie, Indiana, 47603.
You can use that.

285
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,787
Okay.

286
00:38:59,788 --> 00:39:01,539
Do you think that
you'll find her soon?

287
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,298
Well...

288
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:08,045
you're just gonna have to
keep checking in, okay?

289
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:10,806
It's gonna be up to you now.

290
00:39:10,924 --> 00:39:12,766
Okay.

291
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,061
Thank you.

292
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:11,741
I don't think so.

293
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:17,789
Okay, just set the Voltmeter
to the DC scale, all right?

294
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:21,710
Measure the voltage across
the battery terminals.

295
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:25,539
The volt meter reads
less than 14 volts...

296
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,334
you know, it should read 14.

297
00:40:28,335 --> 00:40:30,169
Okay?

298
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,264
If it reads less than 12
you might have a problem.

299
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,219
Okay, tell you what...

300
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,387
you turn on the heater...

301
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:42,973
you turn on the defogger...

302
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,726
you turn on the radio, and
you rev up the motor...

303
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:48,187
you're turning on everything
that draws power...

304
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:51,565
and then you turn on the
motor, you rev up the motor...

305
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:56,403
and if the Voltmeter reads
lower than 14 volts...

306
00:40:56,404 --> 00:41:01,917
your alternator's probably no
good. Okay? Well, good luck.

307
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:04,794
What's up?

308
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:07,414
Start talking, I'm listening.

309
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:10,501
I think I've got a
problem with my S-belt.

310
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,002
What?

311
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:16,382
With my S-belt. I think my
Serpentine belt is cracked.

312
00:41:16,383 --> 00:41:19,392
Oh, yeah. Serpentine belt?

313
00:41:20,387 --> 00:41:23,722
A guy in Salt Lake City said that
he thought it was cracked...

314
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:28,026
and that it would run about
150 dollars for a new one.

315
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:32,022
You were driving with the air
conditioning on? The engine jerked?

316
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,316
Steam came out? That kind of thing?

317
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:38,912
No. It just won't start. It just
makes this terrible sound.

318
00:41:41,658 --> 00:41:43,416
Yeah?

319
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:46,078
Oh, man.

320
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,839
You are blowing my mind.

321
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,710
You are messing up my mind.

322
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:55,171
Okay, I'll tell you what.

323
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:57,673
Yeah, yeah.

324
00:41:57,674 --> 00:42:00,968
50 on Trade Show.

325
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:03,186
No, that's it.

326
00:42:04,097 --> 00:42:08,517
Yeah, yeah, I said, you know, you're
really messing with my mind, man.

327
00:42:08,518 --> 00:42:10,561
Yeah, okay.

328
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,488
Yeah. I'll see you later.

329
00:42:17,777 --> 00:42:20,537
What kind of car are
we talking about?

330
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,489
Well, it's an Accord.

331
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,993
1988. It's right over there.

332
00:42:25,994 --> 00:42:27,786
Well...

333
00:42:27,787 --> 00:42:29,496
Easy enough to replace
the Serpentine belt.

334
00:42:29,497 --> 00:42:31,248
I don't know why the
ignition won't fire, though.

335
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,009
Who knows. Could be
the timing belt.

336
00:42:34,628 --> 00:42:37,512
How much is a new Serpentine belt?

337
00:42:39,132 --> 00:42:40,674
A hundred bucks.

338
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:45,520
125. Depends if we have to order
a new one. I'll have to check stock.

339
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:49,274
And it'll be 50 for labour.

340
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:52,478
That's the best you'll
find. I promise that.

341
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:56,315
Okay. And what about a timing
belt? How much is that?

342
00:42:56,316 --> 00:43:00,819
Could be a little bit more, but I
won't know until I have a look.

343
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,613
Okay.

344
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:07,959
And we're going to have to tow it
over, I guess. That adds another 50.

345
00:43:09,704 --> 00:43:11,747
But it's just right there.

346
00:43:11,748 --> 00:43:16,509
Well, it's always 50. But there's
no mileage here. So it's just 50.

347
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:25,310
30 bucks. I'll give you a deal.

348
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:28,855
Yeah.

349
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:15,670
How's the dog?

350
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,918
No news.

351
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:23,428
No luck at the pound?

352
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:26,598
Not yet.

353
00:45:29,677 --> 00:45:33,555
I had a Collie once that was gone
for two weeks before he came home.

354
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:37,483
They'll find her. They
always get their dog.

355
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:41,154
Yeah, I sure hope so.

356
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:46,777
Could I trade you for a quarter? I need
to use that pay phone over there.

357
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:50,406
All I've got is change and
it only takes quarters.

358
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:52,282
Lots of minutes. Feel free.

359
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:53,409
No, no.

360
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:56,461
No one uses a pay phone
anymore. Come on.

361
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,176
Thanks.

362
00:46:19,436 --> 00:46:25,031
Hi, my name is Wendy Carroll.
I lost my dog Lucy and I...

363
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:29,202
Yeah, yeah, hi.

364
00:46:29,446 --> 00:46:33,665
I was just calling to check and see
if there was any new information.

365
00:46:38,037 --> 00:46:43,549
Okay, alright, I understand. I'll keep
checking. Okay. Thank you. Bye.

366
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:04,938
How late are you here tonight?

367
00:47:04,939 --> 00:47:07,065
Eight o'clock. Eight to eight.

368
00:47:07,066 --> 00:47:08,700
Okay.

369
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:11,987
Better than my last job.
I'll tell you that.

370
00:47:11,988 --> 00:47:15,248
That was all night, every night.

371
00:47:16,993 --> 00:47:19,786
Not a lot of jobs around here, huh?

372
00:47:19,787 --> 00:47:21,538
I'll say.

373
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:24,215
I don't know what the
people do all day.

374
00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:28,803
Use to be a mill. But that's
been closed a long time now.

375
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,805
Don't know what they do.

376
00:47:35,512 --> 00:47:38,847
You can't get a job without
an address anyway...

377
00:47:38,848 --> 00:47:40,724
or a phone.

378
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:42,929
You can't get an address
without an address.

379
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:46,939
You can't get a job
without a job. It's all fixed.

380
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,866
That's why I'm going to Alaska.

381
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:54,412
I hear they need people.

382
00:47:54,781 --> 00:47:56,698
I hear it's really pretty up there.

383
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:58,541
Yeah.

384
00:48:00,662 --> 00:48:03,121
You know, if you need a contact
for the pound or anything...

385
00:48:03,122 --> 00:48:06,424
I'm just standing here with my
hands in my pockets all day.

386
00:48:08,545 --> 00:48:11,763
You can use my phone number
if you like, you know.

387
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:15,433
Yeah.

388
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:21,189
I might do that. That'd be good.

389
00:49:17,905 --> 00:49:20,907
You lost your dog?

390
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:23,076
Wow, bummer.

391
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:25,495
Wow, where did you lose it?

392
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:27,115
You don't know? Well,
I guess if you knew...

393
00:49:27,116 --> 00:49:29,083
- you'd know where to find it.
- Yeah, I guess so.

394
00:49:29,084 --> 00:49:32,044
Well, that's too bad. If I
see it, I'll give you a call.

395
00:49:32,045 --> 00:49:35,263
- Good luck.
- Thanks. Appreciate that.

396
00:50:28,184 --> 00:50:30,276
Lucy!

397
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:45,742
Anything?

398
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:47,835
Afraid not.

399
00:50:48,538 --> 00:50:52,340
They came and rolled your
car away about an hour ago.

400
00:50:54,794 --> 00:50:59,089
You know, I was remembering today,
when I was a boy I'd go hunting...

401
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,133
and sometimes we'd
lose the hound...

402
00:51:01,134 --> 00:51:04,052
so my daddy would take his
coat and leave it in the woods...

403
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:06,972
the last place that he saw the dog.

404
00:51:06,973 --> 00:51:11,400
And after supper he'd come
back to fetch the coat...

405
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:15,863
and more often than not he'd
come back with the dog as well.

406
00:51:17,191 --> 00:51:19,067
Could I use that phone again?

407
00:51:19,068 --> 00:51:21,035
Sure.

408
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:24,455
Thank you.

409
00:51:33,082 --> 00:51:38,010
Hello, I'm calling to check on a dog
that I reported missing. Lucy.

410
00:51:39,881 --> 00:51:44,100
Yeah, sorry, I've just been away from my
phone and so I thought I would check.

411
00:51:44,343 --> 00:51:46,303
Okay.

412
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:48,646
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

413
00:51:56,272 --> 00:51:58,614
Wait.

414
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:02,694
Did you say that the dog would,
the dog came back to a coat?

415
00:52:02,695 --> 00:52:04,029
Yes, indeed.

416
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:07,290
That's how I remember it.

417
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:43,784
Lucy!

418
00:52:46,197 --> 00:52:48,080
Lu!

419
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,482
Lu?

420
00:54:25,755 --> 00:54:28,472
Please, please, please.

421
00:55:46,752 --> 00:55:48,844
Man.

422
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:33,889
Don't look at me.

423
00:56:40,389 --> 00:56:42,982
This is a steep hill, huh?

424
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:45,818
Ain't it?

425
00:56:45,895 --> 00:56:50,398
Those kids coming down
on a cardboard...

426
00:56:50,399 --> 00:56:52,825
they're having some fun.

427
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:58,346
Of course if that cardboard
wasn't so worn and old, you know,

428
00:56:58,347 --> 00:57:00,691
they'd slide better, right?

429
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:20,185
I don't like this place.

430
00:57:23,057 --> 00:57:25,558
You know, it's the fucking people.

431
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:28,360
The fucking people that bother me.

432
00:57:29,188 --> 00:57:31,322
God, they have attitude.

433
00:57:35,277 --> 00:57:37,119
I mean...

434
00:57:40,866 --> 00:57:43,208
I'm out here...

435
00:57:43,911 --> 00:57:46,712
just trying to be a good boy...

436
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:51,091
and it's just like they
don't want to let me.

437
00:57:51,877 --> 00:57:53,886
You know?

438
00:57:54,421 --> 00:58:00,142
I mean, they treat me like
trash, like I ain't got no rights.

439
00:58:03,597 --> 00:58:05,856
I mean...

440
00:58:06,142 --> 00:58:10,069
they can smell the weakness on you.

441
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:14,524
Move it along, move
it along. Fuck you.

442
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:17,326
You know? Fuck you!

443
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:24,208
I mean, they gotta know I've killed
over 700 people with my bare hands.

444
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:36,428
We lost, man.

445
00:58:39,466 --> 00:58:42,309
Fuck if I know.

446
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:31,703
Hang on, girl.

447
01:00:31,704 --> 01:00:33,879
I'm coming.

448
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,709
You look a little stricken.

449
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,420
I've been here since eight.
Where have you been?

450
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:07,715
I had to take Holly's
son to school.

451
01:02:07,716 --> 01:02:10,301
It's my day off today too.

452
01:02:10,302 --> 01:02:13,679
You got a call after you left
here last night. The pound.

453
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,439
Really?

454
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,357
Yes, indeed.

455
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:31,614
Hi, this is Wendy Carroll calling.

456
01:02:31,615 --> 01:02:35,375
I got a message from you all
last night about my dog Lucy.

457
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:43,258
Are you positive?

458
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,685
Okay, where is she exactly?

459
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:58,398
Where the 30 meets Leif...

460
01:02:58,934 --> 01:03:02,110
Where the 30 meets Leif Erickson.

461
01:03:06,233 --> 01:03:09,944
Okay, well, I'll be there right
away. Thank you very much.

462
01:03:09,945 --> 01:03:12,120
Yep. Bye-bye.

463
01:03:13,365 --> 01:03:15,199
All right? Good news?

464
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,752
Yeah. That's good news...

465
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:19,954
- that's good news.
- Great.

466
01:03:19,955 --> 01:03:22,506
Someone took her home.

467
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:24,281
Someone took her home
the day she came in

468
01:03:24,282 --> 01:03:27,837
and that's why they had such a hard
time finding her. She's in a foster home.

469
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,800
Great. I told you they would find
her. Let that go on the record.

470
01:03:32,801 --> 01:03:35,227
It's on the record.

471
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,181
So, that's it, huh? You're
gonna be pulling out?

472
01:03:38,182 --> 01:03:40,183
Uh-huh, that's the plan.

473
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:42,685
Well, I hope it all works out.

474
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:44,736
I know it will.

475
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:52,286
I want you to take this.
Don't argue.

476
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:53,696
Just don't argue.

477
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:56,164
Don't let Holly see. Just....

478
01:03:57,826 --> 01:04:03,046
If you ever come by here again,
you just stop by and say hi, huh?

479
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:06,550
Thank you. I will.

480
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,545
Okay.

481
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:11,555
Bye-bye.

482
01:05:01,056 --> 01:05:03,106
Finally.

483
01:05:16,572 --> 01:05:19,122
- Good morning.
- Morning.

484
01:05:19,575 --> 01:05:21,625
You're up early.

485
01:05:23,495 --> 01:05:26,797
You want some coffee?
I think the first pot's ready.

486
01:05:30,502 --> 01:05:35,680
Yeah, Indiana plates. You're a
long way from home, aren't you?

487
01:05:37,092 --> 01:05:40,685
Got a long way to go, too.

488
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,690
Well, the guy was right
about the serpentine belt.

489
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,465
It's cracked all over the place.

490
01:05:46,466 --> 01:05:48,603
Just a matter of time before
the car gave out on you.

491
01:05:48,604 --> 01:05:50,521
Yeah, that's what he said.

492
01:05:50,522 --> 01:05:53,608
He wasn't all wrong, but
he wasn't all right either.

493
01:05:53,609 --> 01:05:57,111
The serpentine belt is worn out, but
that's not why the car won't start.

494
01:05:57,112 --> 01:05:58,529
No?

495
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:01,081
You've got milky oil.

496
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:06,120
I didn't ask you to check the oil.

497
01:06:06,121 --> 01:06:10,416
I'm just telling you. Look,
you snapped a piston rod.

498
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:12,376
Actually, you blew the
head gasket first...

499
01:06:12,377 --> 01:06:15,379
water got into the cylinder
probably when you cooled it down.

500
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:18,658
The rod can't compress the
fluid then. And there you go,

501
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:22,369
you ended up with what
they call "hydro lock".

502
01:06:22,971 --> 01:06:27,933
And if you want the car to drive again,
you'd have to rebuild the whole engine.

503
01:06:27,934 --> 01:06:30,392
Honestly, I don't think
it's what you want to do.

504
01:06:30,393 --> 01:06:33,430
It would end up costing
more than the car is worth.

505
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:39,028
Yeah?

506
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:41,822
No, I couldn't get
around to it yesterday.

507
01:06:41,823 --> 01:06:44,583
Can you call me back later?

508
01:06:44,743 --> 01:06:47,502
Righto. Bye.

509
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:50,998
Are you sure?

510
01:06:50,999 --> 01:06:53,758
Yeah. No question.

511
01:07:00,592 --> 01:07:02,551
How much?

512
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,603
To fix it?

513
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:07,772
Two thousand.

514
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,601
At least two thousand.

515
01:07:10,602 --> 01:07:14,779
Like I said, more than the car's worth. On
the other hand, it's less than a new car.

516
01:07:22,656 --> 01:07:27,910
Look, I know this is bad news. It's
not what anyone ever wants to hear.

517
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:30,268
But see, the thing is, the car's
taking up space out there

518
01:07:30,269 --> 01:07:33,023
and I need to know
what to do with it.

519
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:38,003
I'll tell you what, just make it
30 bucks for the tow, for the...

520
01:07:38,004 --> 01:07:41,424
to junk it, and we'll take care
of everything and that'll be it.

521
01:07:41,425 --> 01:07:45,393
It's just that I can't just leave the
car sitting out there, it's gotta go.

522
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:15,840
Okay. This is good here.

523
01:08:30,515 --> 01:08:32,274
Thank you.

524
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:26,971
Hey, Lu.

525
01:10:29,134 --> 01:10:31,886
Hey, Lu! Did you miss me? Huh?

526
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:34,354
You miss me? Huh?

527
01:10:34,806 --> 01:10:39,602
You miss me? Huh? Come here, Luce.
Come here. Did you miss me?

528
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:41,611
I'm sorry. Come here.

529
01:10:49,404 --> 01:10:51,663
I know, I know.

530
01:10:53,033 --> 01:10:55,667
Come on, Lu, don't be mad.

531
01:10:59,247 --> 01:11:01,005
Here.

532
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,384
I got you something.

533
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:08,012
Look at that.

534
01:11:09,257 --> 01:11:11,133
Go get it.

535
01:11:11,134 --> 01:11:13,218
Good girl!

536
01:11:13,219 --> 01:11:16,221
You're such a good
catcher, huh? Drop it.

537
01:11:16,222 --> 01:11:18,682
Yes, such a good dog.

538
01:11:18,683 --> 01:11:21,977
Go get it, Lu. Go get that stick.

539
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,979
Good dog.

540
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,448
You are the best catcher.

541
01:11:28,693 --> 01:11:30,702
Drop it, Lu.

542
01:11:31,196 --> 01:11:33,989
Lu. Lu, give me that stick.

543
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,992
Give me that stick, Lu.
Give me that stick.

544
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:40,086
Drop it. Good dog!

545
01:11:40,246 --> 01:11:42,464
Good girl.

546
01:11:44,292 --> 01:11:47,010
It's so nice here, Lu.

547
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:01,483
That man seems nice.

548
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:13,036
Yeah, you got a nice yard.

549
01:12:21,121 --> 01:12:23,129
I'm sorry, Lu.

550
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:34,891
I lost the car.

551
01:12:51,192 --> 01:12:53,201
You be good.

552
01:12:56,948 --> 01:12:59,082
I'll come back.

553
01:12:59,284 --> 01:13:02,669
I'm gonna make some
money and I'll come back.

554
01:13:10,045 --> 01:13:12,095
Okay, Lu?

555
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:14,514
Be good.
