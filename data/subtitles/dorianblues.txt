He died ten years ago,|and I still find...
its good to talk aboutit sometimes.
I findit's good to|talk about ev erything.
My therapist says|Io v erdo that.
That Io v eranalyze.
Of course, she's bulimic so|let'snot get too preachy.
But the first thing you|shou Id know about me: I'm gay.
I'm gay, and what's more,|a stereotypical gay.
Alwayslo v ed fashion,|hated sports,
and thoughit doesn't|always work to clich e,
it didin my family|where there was me,
and there was my|kid brother, Nicky.
He wou Idn'tlook at another|guy ex cept to ask for a beer,
wasour school's star|quarterback, great studen t.
When they sayhigh school are|the best yearsof yourlife...
there talking about|hislife,not mine.
Look at that smilelik ehe|grewupin a blue jeans ad.
Hey whoa,holdon a sec|Nick,let'em tak e youin.
Thanks.
Reallyhad to|twisthis arm,huh?
See, confidence for my|brother wasnev er anissue.
I don't careifits|with women, guys...
Oh, great, company.
Yeah, don't ask mehername.
Yeah, Hi.|How are ya?
Good to see ya.
No,it's OK Nick.
Goon, play.
I enviedhim,'cause|he was sonormal.
Dadlo v ednormal.
There's Dadnow,|fixin' theold set.
Dad wasusually|in a fou I mood.
This, actuallyisoneof|his more spiritual momen ts.
And there's mom,|rolling those pennies.
Thisis about 14|years backnow.
The funeral I showed you|is still a few yearsoff.
Thisis where we start.
Bush, the father, was|in the White House.
I was a seniorinhigh|school, my brother, Nicky,
a Junior, and Dad was|inhis raging prime.
Of courseit|wasn't all yelling.
There was the dinnerhour,|when we discussed politics...
or, more accurately,|Dad discussed, we agreed.
There was anunwritten|ruleinourhouse:
You didnot disagree|with my father directly,
especially about politics.
So, to ex ert your|individuality you simply...
agreed withhimin the most|original way you cou Id find.
Wel I, that wasour mistakein|givingup Vietnam was that we...
gave the communists the|idea that we didn'thave...
the resolve for along fight.
Uh, and thatour free press|was always going toundermineus.
Wel I put.
Well put.
You know Nicky, you make more|sense than men twice your age.
I mean doesn'the,|doesn'the?
Good job, son.
But as this particular dinner|con tinued, and Dad wen ton,
certainof ev erything,|something v erynerv e-wracking...
began tohappen to me.
For the first timein mylife,|I began to get theurge to disagree.
The more I fough t theurge,|the moreit grew, and grew,un til...
I disagree.
I'm sorry.|What was that?
I said, I disagree?|I think you're wrong.
-oh, I forgot the applesauce...|- No,no,no sit.
- It's rightin the refrigerator.|- No, sit.
Everyoneinourhousehas a|right to theirownopinion.
So what's yours, Dorian?
You tel Ius exactly|what I'm wrong about.
Nixon.
I don't thinkhe was|a good president,
I thinkhe was a bad|president and a bad man.
I think what Dorian|meanshereis...
I mean t what I said, Nick.
Why?
Why was Nixon a|bad president?
Wel Ihe wasn'thonest.
Oh.|Wel I, was Kennedyhonest?
Kennedy?
Yeah,uh, was|John F. Kennedyhonest...
with the wayhe won|the electionin 1960.
You know, with Cook|County I I Iinois and...
the West Virginia Primaries?
Wel I, I'm surehe|wasn't alwayshonest,
I don't think any|po Iiticianis.
Wel I then I'mlegitimately|confused becauseif they were...
both dishonest why|do youhate Nixon...
andhave a picture|of J F Kon your wal I?
Alotof reasons.
- You though t JFK was great.|- Right.
Wel I then, your criterion for|greatness can't behonesty,
otherwise b y yourown|admission you'd be ahypocrite.
I'mnot ahypocrite.
No,no.|I, I know.
That's what I'm strugg Iing with,|because without you being...
ahypocrite your|argument makesno sense.
Kennedy wasn't a|paranoid s chizophrenic.
Oh, Nixonis a paranoid|s chizophrenic.
I think so.
- So thisis an expertopinion.|- Expert?
Well, yeah.
I mean that's a rather|sophisticated ps y chological term;
paranoid s chizophrenic.
So I was wonderingif,if you|have any experiencein the field.
A psychiatric degree that|qualifies you to mak e...
such a conclusive diagnosis|on a man you'venever met.
No.
Maybe you think because you|have a few emotional problems...
of yourownit makes you sort|of anhonorary doctorof the stuff.
Dis cussiono ver.|Potatoes please.
You know, I wi I I give youone|pieceof advice via another...
great American president;|Abraham Linco In,
who said: "I wou Id rather sit|quietly andhave them think...
Ihav enothingin telligen t to|say rather thanopen my mouth...
and remo ve al I doubt.
I got shot down,|butit was worthit,
'causeit jarred something.
Later thatnigh t,|Ihad an epiphany:
For the first timein mylife,|I realized I was gay.
Not just confused,or going|through a phase but actually gay.
Thatnigh t I cameout|of the closet to myself.
But thisonly|made things worse.
I was anxiety-ridden|outof my mind.
Ineeded to talk to someone.
But there wasnoonein|my family I cou Id go to.
I didn'thav e any|friendsinhigh school.
High school.
Finallyin my desperation|I endedup down town...
at social services where I met|with a part-time social work er...
with a fewissuesofhisown.
You mindif I drink?
Uh,no.
We'renot, you know,|really supposed to drink.
Lookif you'rehaving|a bad day, I...
I amhaving a bad day,|because this morning...
my girlfriend and|Iof two years... sp Iit.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You wanna know the truth?
I think after the|initial shock wearsoff...
I'm really gonna see this|as a blessing, really.
Because this woman was|on my case from dayone.
I mean making demands|andnagging me and...
you know what she wanted|me to dolast week?
She wanted me to enro I I|inoneof these...uh...
what do you cal Iit...|anger management courses.
How'd you feel about that?
Pissed meoff.
Becauseit'snot about anger,|it's about changing me.
You know, about|changing my clothes,
and my friends and my... you|know, Ihave a motto, alright?
If you'renothapp y with me,|exactly the way I am...
then you canleave.
- So sheleft.|- Yeah sheleft.
Anyway, what can we at the|Family Mental Health C Iinic...
do for you today?
Iheard you can pro vide|low-rate therapists?
Maybe someone who specializes|in sexualorientationissues.
Sexual...
Someone who thinks|he might be gay.
Oooh.
H mm... Here you go,|a Doctor Mitchener.
Therap y for... what you got.
- Is this thelowered rate?|- Yeah.
I guess I can't|afford therap y.
Totallyo verrated|anyway, believe me.
Look pal, whatever's|bugging you,
justhashitout with|someonein yourown Iife.
Thatusually works.
- Really?|- Yeah.
Wel I I suppose I cou Id|try talking to my mother.
If you're mother's a good thing|in your Iife then that's great.
Mine wasn'tin mine.|But then she died.
Things arelookingup.
- Mom?|- Yes, s weetie?
Ineed to talk.
Then you sit right|there and talk.
Thank you.
- What are you doing?|- Seeing what we'reoutof.
I can do this and|Iisten to you.
Talk to me.
Mom.
Mom.
Mom, I'm afraid I'm different.
God madeus al I|differenthoney,
to keep Iifeinteresting.
- You,he made moody.|- That'snot allhe made me.
Look Mom, I've gotta faceit.
I'mnot Iike the|other guys at s choo I.
Younever wanted|to be Iike them.
You called them Neanderthals.
True, I didn't want to be Iike|them but maybe I wished...
toohard becausenow|I'mnot Iike anyone.
I find myself envying|the Neanderthals.
Wel I, you knowhow|I feel about envy.
Envy'snot the point.
Ok, justone secondnow|let me as you something.
-o K.|- Let me just ask this.
Al I right.
Last week I bought chocolate|chip cookies andnobody ate them.
Shou Id Inot get chocolate|chip ev er again...
and just stick withoatmeal?
Is that what you're|al I trying to tel I me?
Theonly difference between|my mother and the Berlin Wall?
Some people got|past that wall.
Well, thatnigh t I decided someone|was going tohear me sayit.
So before Nickleft for this|big party I madehim thelucky|someone.
Don't freakout.
Please, don't freakout.
Thank you for|not freakingout.
How many peoplehave|you to Id this to?
- Nobody.|- Don't. Ever.
Do youunderstand me?
Don't ever talk Iike|this around anybody.
Jesus Christ man,if Dad|everheard this shit...
he'd bury youin the basement.
I'mnot tel Iing Dad.
But I think some people|suspect already.
Who?
Wel I, some guys|at s choo I maybe.
Who at s choo I?
Who cares, Nicky?|Thisis who I am.
- I cannothideit forever.|- Thisisnot who you are.
You donothave a|clue who you are.
You've always been|the most confused,
s crewedupindividual...
I've been confused|about this.
Oh man, don't cry.
- Stop crying, Dorian.|- I'mnot.
Dude.
O K.
O K.
Look, I promised Kev Halen|that I'd get there early...
andhelphim setup so,um,|why don't you come...

No, that's O K.|You go.

Thanks.
Youneed to talknow,|don't you?
- Mmm-hmm.|-o K.
So we talk ed.
And when the phone started|ringing and the whole school...
wan ted my brother|at the party,
he told Mom to tell|themhe was sick.
Wehadourown party.
Got drunk, played pok er for|Aun t Bette's Easter money,
told jok es about Mom|and Dad tillithurt.
Turnedout to be|a greatnigh t.
Truly classic.
The kindofnigh t|that mak es you think;
maybehigh school really are|the best yearsof yourlife.
- Can Ihelp you?|- Yeah.
We were just wonderingif you cou Id|giveus the definitionof a word.
Dictionariesoutof print?
Wel I, you know we thought|it wou Id be easier...
to ask a smart person.
What word?
Uh, what was that again guys?
Oh yeah, yeah.
It was,umhomo...homosexual.
Cou Id you tel Iushow you|wou Id define the word;homosexual?
And then maybeuse|itin a sentence.
I wou Id defineit as someone|you're deathly afraidof.
So... shou Id we be|afraidof you?
Comeon, thatis so rude when|somebodyis talking right to you.
We'renot talking.
Listen, faggot.
I don't know who you think|you're dealing with.
Lookout, Cal.
Hey.
Aw.
Shit, man.
Hey, Nick, I was just|messing withhim.
Yeah?|That's al I you ever do, Cal.
You know, there's alot more|to Iife than messing with people.
Youought to branch|out a Iittle bit.
See what I mean?|People suspect.
Just keep denyingit.|Remember what Hitler said.
You tel I a Iielong|enough andloud enough,
eventually they'I I|believeit.
So your adviceis|be more Iike Hitler?
You know what I mean.
Yes.|Stayin the closet.
Yeah, andlock the door.

Hey, where'd you|disappear to after s choo I?
What are you, my keeper?

Don'tlook for me.

Hey, you know something?
Youlook kindof guilty.
Did you do something wrong?
Getoutofhere.
Hey, did you|do something... gay?
We connectedin this|Iike, s ci-fi moment.
It was Iike...
Yes.
We're both alike, we're|both "homo senturions."
Both aliens.
Do you feel Iike|an alien, Dorian?
Yes.|Do you?
Not any more.
- Howlong didit take you.|- A few years maybe.
Wel I,uh, I don't|have a few years, doc.
I've got to go to|N YUin the fal I.
You've got to get|me adjusted andnow.
Plus, I can't afford|al Iof these sessions,
I'm dippinginto my|savings for this.
Relax.
We'I I doour best.
Oh, there's a|great doctor Iine;
"relax, we'll doour best".
Usually followed by|"Sorry, we did al I we cou Id."
What do youlo ve most|about yourself, Dorian?
Uh, Ihave a goodheart.
And what do you|dis Iike the most?
U m, my anxiety.
What do youlo ve the|most about your father.
Oh, I see the questions get|progressively more difficult.
Why don't you tel I|him that you're gay?
Because,it wou Id be the|ug Iiest momentof my Iife...
and I amnot that strong.
See that dummyo ver there?
- Know who thatis?|- My father?
Very good.
I'd Iike for you to goo ver there|and tel Ihim that you're gay.
Just... talk tohim.
Hey Dad.
What?
He saysnow's|not a good time.
Hey Dad, thisis|Dr. Mitchener.
- I'mnothere.|-oh, al I right.
Dad, I've been seeing|this Dr. Mitchener,
andhe...uh,he's a doctor|of ps y chology, I think.
Uh, right,not an M. D. Uh...
I don't know whyhe|didn't go al I the way.
O K.
Anno ying,isn'the?
Yeah, buthe'snot|going to speak,
he's just going to Iisten.
Al I right.
Dad, I just wanted you to|know that I am...
ummm...uh...
Dad,umm...
Got some work to do,huh?
Did you ever get to spend any|time alone with your father,
just you andhim?
Wel I... there was the time|he taught mehow to drive.
- Know what you did wrong?|- No.
- You were driving too fast.|- No, Dad.
I was going the speed Iimit.
That speed Iimitis for|experienced drivers...
underideal conditions.
Not you,on a wet road.
To be fair,itis|nerve-wracking...
for any parent to teach|their chi Id to drive.
I don't know,he|also taught Nicky.
I got to tel I you, Nicky... youhave|the reflexesof a race car driver.
Doesn'the?
Doesn'the?
I want you to explore this|first major anxiety episode.
- You were seven.|- Yes.
Youinitially went to your|mother with this fear.
- Mommy?|- Yes s weetie?
- I'm s cared.|- What are you s caredof?
Going to war.
But thereisno war,honey.|Vietnam'so ver.
Mrs. Ti Ily says there's|always another war...
and then maybe I'mo Id enough.
If there's another war,|then you don'thave to go.
Really,how come?
Cause we wou Id al I packour bags|and mo ve straightup to Canada.
- Where's Canada?|- U pnorth.
And they don'thave|wars there, just moose.
- Whatisit?|- Dad's coming.
So, don't want to|go to war,huh?
Amen.|I canunderstand.
So what do you thinkinstead?|Goingup to Canada?
Mom says Canada|doesn'thave wars.
No,no, they don'thave wars.
They don'thave wars|because theyhaveus.
We're their Iineof defense|against the Communists.
But, what do you think might|happenif the Communists...
ever got windof the fact|that al Iour young men...
wou Id rather runup to Canada|than stay and defend this country?
They might getitinto their|head that they cou Id just...
have Texas and Oklahoma,|just for the asking.
And then Virginia,|Penns ylvania,
then New York and at that|point what wou Id stop them...
from running righton|upinto Canada as wel I,
looking for the Iikesof you,|and shooting you...
rightin the belly?
No, you'renot|going to Canada.
You're going to war.
And you may get ki Iled, but|you'I I get ki Iled Iike a man,
for your country.
Dad, I'm gay.
Ilo ve you.
It's a common development.
I thought that's|what you'd say.
What did you want me to|say, that Ilo ve you too?
Maybe.
Al I right, Dorian.|Ilo ve you too.
Not Iike that,not Iike|youlo ve al Iof mankind...
and I justhappen to|beoneof them.
Besides the fact that|you're a virgin, craving...
a first experience and that|you feel safe with me,
besides those things, what|exactly do youlo ve about me?
I guess that's|pretty muchit.
I'm sti I I flattered.
However, I donotunder any|circumstances sleep with my clients.
Cou Id you maybe refer|me to someone who does?
Forgive me father,it's been|awhile since mylast confession,
anduh, I've done some|of theusual sins, I guess.
I've disrespected my father|which to behonest...
I don't think I'm ever|going to stop butuh...
something bigger this time,|I kindofhad sex.
Wel I, that's a serious sin, butit|is common within your age group.
With a guy.
- Pretty big sin,huh?|- Yesitis.
Why?|Whyisit a sin?
Go back to your side.
I don't want to go|back to my side.
Please Father.|Comeon, you knowit's me.
It's a sin becauseit|says soin the Bible,
and the Bibleis|the wordof God.
Buthow do you know every bit|ofitis the wordof God.
I knowiton faith.
A faith which comes from|yearsof research and prayer.
Bothof which I suggest|you beginimmediately.
I don't know, Father.
I'mnot convinced I've|done anything wrong.
If you didn't do|anything wrong,
then why do you suppose you|feel so guilty aboutit?
What's gui It pro ve?
I mean, I feel guilty when|there's mud s Iidesin E cuador.
Evenifit weren't wrong,|wou Id you really Iike to...
Iive a Iife style which means|you cou Idnever get married,
neverhave chi Idren?
No, I want chi Idren.
Then youhaven't|thought this through.
But maybe I don't|get chi Idren.
Don't be so sure.
Often with a Iittle|prayer and effort,
thosein your situation find|that they can desire women.
- Really?|- Absolutely.
I've been counseling|for years.
The first man I talked to was|convincedhe cou Idn't behelped.
Todayhe Iivesin Ohio with|his wifeof fourteen years...
and theirnine chi Idren.
- Nine?|- Amen,nine.
He called themhisown|Iittle basebal I team.
Even got themuniforms.
You shou Id see them,|they're cute ashel I.
Hello, Dr. Mitchener?|Thisis Dorian Legatis.
I just wanted you to know I|won't beneeding any more sessions.
I've found another path.
But I wish youluckon|your journey and... amen.
- Ilo ve you, Dad.|- Ah.
Nicky.
Nicky.
- What?|- I can't doit anymore.
- Do what?|- It's wrong to be gay,
to actonit, anyway.
It's ev en wrong tohav e some|of the gay though ts I'm thinking.
It's wrong to even think?
Yes.|"Thou shaltnot co vet."
It's the tenth commandment:|Thou shaltnot co vet...
thyneighbor's wife,"|let alone thyneighbor.
- Whathave you been reading?|- The Holy Bible.
What thehel I are you|reading that for, man?
Ihaven't read that|since grade s choo I.
Wel I, you shou Id.
It's mostly about straight|sex, and believe me,
you'rein some deep shit too.
- Well, we're all sinners, righ t?|- Yes, that's right.
So then I'I I keepon sinning|ti I I I'm Iike, thirty,
and then I'I I repent|and takeup golf.
Isn't thathowit works?
But whatif you don't|Iive ti I I thirty?
Whatif you die|tonightin your sleep?
Look, Dor,if I'm so|s crewed being straight...
then what are you worried|about being gay for?
Cause I decided that|I want tohave kids.
Oh, well that'so v er.
Don't say that'so ver, don't|you dare say that'so ver...
it's what I want more than|anythingin the whole world.

- Base... youhate basebal I.|- Yes, but Ilo veuniforms.
So Ineed yourhelp.
I want you to teach me|how to think straight.
You want me to teach you?
Yeah, I want to turn this|around so bad and I've been...
thinking thatif someone|Iike you cou Id teach me
how you think sexually, you know,|maybe I cou Id reboot my brain.
- You want to turn this around?|- Yes.

Cause Ihav ehad some|though tson this.
Youhave?
Absolutely, I mean I didn't|want to push themon you...

When actually Ihad stumbled|on to something far worse.
It wasunreal.
I cou Idn't breathe... and|it wasn'tlong before...
I started toloseit, and|I was pretty much screwed.
Un til my mind coughed|up thisobscure memory.
Shit!
You brok e mynose!
Ah!
You're dead!
So dead!
I endedupin four daysin St.|Vincen t's for a serious concussion.
It was soironic.
Nickyhad been playing|football sincehe wasnine...
andhadnev er|gotten a concussion.
I was going for aliberal arts|degree and alreadyhad two.
So after this|muscle-maninciden t,
I declared my preference|a-sexual andhit the books.
Ov er thenext few years I|became ahighhonors studen t,
VPof my class and a bit|of a soap bo x activist.
Meanwhile, Nicky|wen t to Syracuse,
and throughhisletters I got|theimpression that things...
weren't going as easily|ashe wasused to.
It was the first time that|the angelshad turned their
backson my brother|and towards me.
I've been to the zoo.
- I'm sorry?|- I said, I've been to the zoo.
Zoo story,e dward Alb y.|Very good.
Now I know I'mnot|wasting my time.

Wel I, I to Id them I was bringing|a friend along, you know.
Just the though tof meeting|Ben's paren ts sen t me...
in to mynewest affliction;
hyperv en tilation.
I'dnev er met anyone's|paren ts before.
Literally, theonly|paren ts I'd met were myown,
and that didn't go v ery well.
I was terrified|they'd suspect.
Suspect what?
That we're more|than just friends.
Doesn't your brother|introducehis guy buddies...
to your parents al I the time?
- Yeah.|- Same thing.
You think?
Sure, they won't|suspect a thing.
Unless,of course, you do|something to tip themoff.
I'm kidding.|Just kidding.
So Dorian,how's your steak?
It's awesome.

- We know!|- We know!
They're super-Iiberal,|they don't care.
- We don't care!|- We don't care!
Dorian's parents are creep y|ultra-conservatives, so...
Thisis kindof|creep y, too, actually.
I cou Idn't believ e mylife.
Ihad met my sou I mate.
Andhis paren ts, thoughodd,|were completely accepting.
And then, just as|quickly, Benleft.
Nev er gav e a good reason,|just saidhe was tiredofus.

And Iobsessed.
- Thishas to stop.|- Itis stopping, I promise.
I justneed to ask|youone question.
Why did you breakup with me?
Because I didn't want|to be with you any more.
Cou Id you be more specific,|I'm trying to grow from this.
I don't know Dorian,it|just didn't takeoff.
I don't know, I'mnot|an expertinlo ve.
I don't analyze|everything Iike you do,
and I don't want tohurt you,|but really, knowit,it'so ver.
I'mnever gonna change|my mindon that.
It's done, we're done.|History,o ver, finished.
Did youneed more time|to think about this?
Jesus.
Just know that I amhere|if you everneed to talk...
ornot.
Your cal I,no pressure.
It was reallyo v er,|and I cou Idn't deal.
I started walking the|streets, began to drink,
the depression I'd always|liv ed with wen t clinical...
til all I sawin this|city were the seams.
In fact, I became|a seam myself.
I clung to thehope Ben's|fearof being alone...
wou Id driv ehim back|to me by default.
But ev en that was shattered|when Elle got someinsideinfo.
Benisnot alonehe's|with someone else.
What?
I just wan ted to crawlin to|bed for the en tire week end.
But the gods werenot|through with me yet.

They say a bo y becomes a|man the dayhis father dies.
For meithappened|a few dayslate.
I was getting fedup.
I'd already been through|twonigh tsof wak es,
listening to a million people|praise my fatherlik ehe was...
Ghandi's better brother.
And come the morningof the funeral|I'm brooding on the fron tlawn,
half hungo v er|and seriously considering...
not attending the days ev en ts,|and I think my mother knewit.
What are you doing?
Just trying to get|myheadon straight.
Don't waitup.
Headon straight about what,|you father?
He cou Id be a real son|of a bitch, couldn't he?
Ex cuse me?
What, you didn't|think I knew that?
I didn't think you'd sayit.
Wel I,he was very|angry... I know.
Like to talk about|you for a minute.
- You want to talk, Mom?|- Yes.
- About something?|- Don't.
Al I right, what do you|want to talk about?
Abouthow much you|remind meofhim.
- Of who, Dad?|- Yes.
Whatis that, some kind|of twisted comp Iiment?
It'snot a comp Iiment at al I.
I'm saying you're|angry too,honey.
Don't you seehow|angry you are?
I do.|Your Aunt Beth does.
I don't want that.
I don't wan t you to be angry|and hateful to ward people.
I want you to be good.
Even though your father|wasn't good to you...
and your mother didn'thave|thenerve to stophim.
I know, bab y... I shou Id|have stoppedhim.
Wel I, that's al I|Ihad to say.
It was alot actually.
It was alot,|becauseit was true.
My father didleav e|me pissedoff.
And you know why?
You know theone worst thing|that my father ev er did to me?
He convinced meit matters|what people thinkof you,
and truthis theynev er|think quite enough.
So from then,|I startedliving mylife...

Ev en when they|though t I was crazy...
and shou Id tak e myliberal views|and my pink shirt...
and mo v e to another planet,|I justhad tolaugh...
