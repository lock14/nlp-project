{2645}{2693}and thoughit doesn't|always work to clich e,
{2694}{2743}it didin my family|where there was me,
{2745}{2820}and there was my|kid brother, Nicky.

{3675}{3705}No,it's OK Nick.
{3707}{3736}Goon, play.
{3767}{3836}I enviedhim,'cause|he was sonormal.
{3837}{3887}Dadlo v ednormal.
{3889}{3941}There's Dadnow,|fixin' theold set.
{3943}{3990}Dad wasusually|in a fou I mood.
{3992}{4050}This, actuallyisoneof|his more spiritual momen ts.
{4052}{4128}And there's mom,|rolling those pennies.
{4129}{4180}Thisis about 14|years backnow.
{4181}{4250}The funeral I showed you|is still a few yearsoff.
{4252}{4284}Thisis where we start.
{4285}{4332}Bush, the father, was|in the White House.
{4333}{4393}I was a seniorinhigh|school, my brother, Nicky,
{4395}{4475}a Junior, and Dad was|inhis raging prime.
{4477}{4528}Of courseit|wasn't all yelling.
{4530}{4597}There was the dinnerhour,|when we discussed politics...
{4599}{4688}or, more accurately,|Dad discussed, we agreed.
{4689}{4734}There was anunwritten|ruleinourhouse:
{4736}{4791}You didnot disagree|with my father directly,
{4793}{4840}especially about politics.
{4841}{4894}So, to ex ert your|individuality you simply...
{4896}{4980}agreed withhimin the most|original way you cou Id find.
{5015}{5099}Wel I, that wasour mistakein|givingup Vietnam was that we...
{5101}{5179}gave the communists the|idea that we didn'thave...
{5181}{5220}the resolve for along fight.
{5222}{5332}Uh, and thatour free press|was always going toundermineus.
{5333}{5382}Wel I put.
{5384}{5432}Well put.
{5434}{5510}You know Nicky, you make more|sense than men twice your age.
{5512}{5555}I mean doesn'the,|doesn'the?
{5557}{5613}Good job, son.
{5614}{5690}But as this particular dinner|con tinued, and Dad wen ton,
{5692}{5763}certainof ev erything,|something v erynerv e-wracking...
{5765}{5812}began tohappen to me.
{5813}{5915}For the first timein mylife,|I began to get theurge to disagree.
{5917}{6033}The more I fough t theurge,|the moreit grew, and grew,un til...
{6057}{6081}I disagree.
{6173}{6209}I'm sorry.|What was that?
{6211}{6312}I said, I disagree?|I think you're wrong.
{6314}{6375}-oh, I forgot the applesauce...|- No,no,no sit.
{6377}{6412}- It's rightin the refrigerator.|- No, sit.
{6414}{6481}Everyoneinourhousehas a|right to theirownopinion.
{6483}{6516}So what's yours, Dorian?
{6517}{6581}You tel Ius exactly|what I'm wrong about.
{6583}{6611}Nixon.
{6613}{6650}I don't thinkhe was|a good president,
{6652}{6698}I thinkhe was a bad|president and a bad man.
{6700}{6721}I think what Dorian|meanshereis...
{6723}{6753}I mean t what I said, Nick.
{6755}{6781}Why?
{6783}{6845}Why was Nixon a|bad president?
{6847}{6876}Wel Ihe wasn'thonest.
{6877}{6937}Oh.|Wel I, was Kennedyhonest?
{6938}{6954}Kennedy?
{6956}{6989}Yeah,uh, was|John F. Kennedyhonest...
{6991}{7048}with the wayhe won|the electionin 1960.
{7049}{7097}You know, with Cook|County I I Iinois and...
{7099}{7133}the West Virginia Primaries?
{7135}{7177}Wel I, I'm surehe|wasn't alwayshonest,
{7179}{7220}I don't think any|po Iiticianis.
{7222}{7282}Wel I then I'mlegitimately|confused becauseif they were...
{7284}{7328}both dishonest why|do youhate Nixon...
{7329}{7379}andhave a picture|of J F Kon your wal I?
{7381}{7411}Alotof reasons.
{7413}{7452}- You though t JFK was great.|- Right.
{7454}{7525}Wel I then, your criterion for|greatness can't behonesty,
{7526}{7577}otherwise b y yourown|admission you'd be ahypocrite.
{7579}{7607}I'mnot ahypocrite.
{7609}{7644}No,no.|I, I know.
{7646}{7689}That's what I'm strugg Iing with,|because without you being...
{7691}{7744}ahypocrite your|argument makesno sense.
{7745}{7804}Kennedy wasn't a|paranoid s chizophrenic.
{7805}{7888}Oh, Nixonis a paranoid|s chizophrenic.
{7889}{7912}I think so.
{7913}{7960}- So thisis an expertopinion.|- Expert?
{7961}{7996}Well, yeah.
{7997}{8068}I mean that's a rather|sophisticated ps y chological term;
{8069}{8120}paranoid s chizophrenic.
{8121}{8216}So I was wonderingif,if you|have any experiencein the field.
{8217}{8304}A psychiatric degree that|qualifies you to mak e...
{8305}{8391}such a conclusive diagnosis|on a man you'venever met.
{8393}{8415}No.
{8417}{8468}Maybe you think because you|have a few emotional problems...
{8469}{8579}of yourownit makes you sort|of anhonorary doctorof the stuff.
{8654}{8721}Dis cussiono ver.|Potatoes please.
{8848}{8933}You know, I wi I I give youone|pieceof advice via another...
{8935}{9003}great American president;|Abraham Linco In,
{9005}{9100}who said: "I wou Id rather sit|quietly andhave them think...
{9102}{9190}Ihav enothingin telligen t to|say rather thanopen my mouth...
{9192}{9234}and remo ve al I doubt.
{9290}{9341}I got shot down,|butit was worthit,
{9343}{9394}'causeit jarred something.
{9396}{9447}Later thatnigh t,|Ihad an epiphany:
{9449}{9532}For the first timein mylife,|I realized I was gay.
{9534}{9624}Not just confused,or going|through a phase but actually gay.
{9625}{9688}Thatnigh t I cameout|of the closet to myself.
{9721}{9764}But thisonly|made things worse.
{9765}{9823}I was anxiety-ridden|outof my mind.
{9825}{9874}Ineeded to talk to someone.
{9876}{9939}But there wasnoonein|my family I cou Id go to.
{9941}{9994}I didn'thav e any|friendsinhigh school.
{9996}{10012}High school.
{10049}{10105}Finallyin my desperation|I endedup down town...
{10107}{10185}at social services where I met|with a part-time social work er...
{10187}{10242}with a fewissuesofhisown.
{10248}{10271}You mindif I drink?
{10273}{10291}Uh,no.
{10293}{10352}We'renot, you know,|really supposed to drink.
{10354}{10392}Lookif you'rehaving|a bad day, I...
{10393}{10459}I amhaving a bad day,|because this morning...
{10461}{10557}my girlfriend and|Iof two years... sp Iit.
{10559}{10590}Oh, I'm sorry.
{10592}{10618}You wanna know the truth?
{10620}{10663}I think after the|initial shock wearsoff...
{10665}{10739}I'm really gonna see this|as a blessing, really.
{10741}{10835}Because this woman was|on my case from dayone.
{10837}{10911}I mean making demands|andnagging me and...
{10913}{10968}you know what she wanted|me to dolast week?
{10969}{11038}She wanted me to enro I I|inoneof these...uh...
{11040}{11170}what do you cal Iit...|anger management courses.
{11172}{11196}How'd you feel about that?
{11198}{11245}Pissed meoff.
{11246}{11371}Becauseit'snot about anger,|it's about changing me.
{11373}{11429}You know, about|changing my clothes,
{11431}{11575}and my friends and my... you|know, Ihave a motto, alright?
{11577}{11645}If you'renothapp y with me,|exactly the way I am...
{11646}{11685}then you canleave.
{11687}{11727}- So sheleft.|- Yeah sheleft.
{11729}{11809}Anyway, what can we at the|Family Mental Health C Iinic...
{11810}{11836}do for you today?
{11837}{11895}Iheard you can pro vide|low-rate therapists?
{11897}{12009}Maybe someone who specializes|in sexualorientationissues.
{12011}{12033}Sexual...
{12034}{12099}Someone who thinks|he might be gay.
{12101}{12132}Oooh.
{12133}{12267}H mm... Here you go,|a Doctor Mitchener.
{12269}{12378}Therap y for... what you got.
{12380}{12426}- Is this thelowered rate?|- Yeah.
{12428}{12461}I guess I can't|afford therap y.
{12463}{12515}Totallyo verrated|anyway, believe me.
