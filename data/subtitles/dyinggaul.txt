-Anything I can do for you?
-Be happy.



Three out of four of the last presidents
have been governors...



which is why I think we should target
the money there rather.... Just a second.



Would you like me to take them?
You could have some time for yourself.



I can't think of anyone
I'd less like to spend time with.



-You sure?
-I'm positive. Thanks.



All right, well, be careful. Stick with Bella.



Bye.



Sorry. Target the money there
rather than on congressional races.



Yes.



Fatality.



Fatality.



Oh, my God.



Good morning.



Hey, I'm Olaf, Jeffrey's assistant.
Pleasure to meet you.



So, Robert, we are interested in your script.



-We're interested in The Dying Gaul.
-Okay.



So, that's that.



-Your agent is....
-Dead.



Yeah. Thanks.



Malcolm. Malcolm Cartonis.



-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.



Thank you.



-Who's taken over for him?
-Well, nobody.



Unfortunately,
he was kind of a one-man band.



Well, a good one obviously...



because I've read the script,
and Kohlberg's read it.



He has?



We don't green-light anything
without his approval.



Green-light?



No, I'm not saying we're making your script.



I'm saying we've all read it,
and we all think it's good.



And that's why I'm talking to you.



-Yes?
-Your wife.



Excuse me.



-Hey.
-Hi.



What's up?



Did we buy something
called Mortal Kombat?



Why? What is it?



It's this incredibly graphic,
violent video game...



with people's brains
blowing out of their head like tomato aspic.



Honey...



I've got somebody in the office.



-Oh, okay, sorry.
-Okay? We'll take care of it.



-Call me later.
-Okay.



-I love you.
-Love you, too.



So, where do you think you wanna go
with the script?



I'm sorry?



Where else do you wanna go
with the script?



Well, I thought I might take it
to some of the independents.



No, no. What a doll you are.



What kind of work do you wanna do on it?



-Oh, I'm sorry.
-That's okay.



That was just so sweet.



From acceptance to total rejection,
you took it all in stride.



What kinds of things
have you thought about or....



Well, it's as far as I could take it
without some kind of input from a director.



-And who's your dream director?
-Gus Van Sant, I guess...



-since Truffaut is dead.
-Good.



-Would you like me to show him the script?
-Yeah, sure. Why not?



That's good.
'Cause I already have and he likes it.



-I think I'm in the wrong office.
-He has some questions, as we all do.



And what's the title? Explain the title to me.



Well, you know, they go to that museum...



-Ken and Maurice.
-...in Rome...



-and they see the statue--
-Yeah.



But why is that the name of the movie?



-Hold on.
-Because--



Sorry.



Oh, I see.



I see. Because they feel that the sculpture...



in depicting the vanquished,
the dying soldier....



No, thank you.



-And the Gauls fought naked.
-Right.



-So, he's so young and defenseless...
-Beautiful.



...with just this little hole in his side.



And being that the statue
is by a Roman, by...



Wow.



...by someone from the side
responsible for the slaughter.



And they identify with the Gaul,
because they're gay...



and so many of their friends are dying...



and they're looking for
some kind of response from the enemy.



-Right.
-And remember that part...



when Maurice says...



"Maybe some kind of compassion
was awakened in the Romans...



"by seeing the sculpture?



"And at some future time,
as a result, maybe some other--"



-Gaul.
-Yes.



Will be spared.



It's kind of oblique.



No, I understand.
And it has a political overtone.



-That's right. Which I imagine--
-No, no.



We're not afraid of that.
We're not afraid of anything.



The idea is to have the broadest appeal,
so that we can make money.



But also...



so that to whatever degree
the movie affects people...



it can also be kind of a dying Gaul
for the viewers.



I mean, if you even look at a movie like...



well, say, just to pick something, Tootsie...



which we didn't make,
but which is a very good movie.



-Yeah. It's a great comedy.
-Yeah.



It says something,
in a small but totally amusing way.



You don't see it coming.
This guy is an arrogant...



you know, chauvinist.



He, for his own reasons,
feels he has to dress up as a woman...



and as a result he learns something
about what it means to be a man.



-And you feel good for him.
-Yeah.



So that's the kind of political statement
you can slip an audience...



without their feeling they've been had.



All right.



Well, The Dying Gaul isn't a comedy,
it's a weepy.



And these movies are very...



hard...



to sell.



They're very hard.



And they're my favorite kind of movie.



They just need to be made with care.



Okay? So...



I understand your reasons
for wanting the men to be men...



because of the political dimension...



-but Ken and Maurice--
-I'm not making them heterosexual.



-No, no. Please.
-I'm sorry.



I'm not asking you
to jettison any of your principles.



Sorry.



I think I know what kind
of person you are, Robert.



-Sorry.
-I mean, I read your script.



You hungry?



Early money is like yeast.



In other words.... Oh, wait, hold on.



Hello?



Oh, hi. Thanks for getting back to me.



Listen, do you have any video games
for an 8-year-old...



that don't involve human slaughter?



The Silence of the Lambs is another one
that touches on feminist ideology without....



-Did you like that movie?
-Yes and no.



-Did you make it?
-No.



-No, no. Why didn't you like it?
-The faggy portrayal of the killer.



-He's not gay. Jame Gumb is not gay.
-Yeah, that's what I heard...



but I think that's a bunch of bullshit
because he has the poodle.



I had a poodle.



My wife and I had a poodle.



Okay, but I bet you didn't wear nipple rings
and put on eyeliner.



And you probably didn't cut up women
because you wanted to be one.



-You never know.
-True.



Hey, you wanna meet Tim Burton?



It's just something's not working.



-Let me check.
-ls that a new battery?



I see.



What about Nick Cage?



I mean, he's losing his hair.
What's that about?



-So, do you want to sell this script?
-Sure.



-And do you wanna do the rewrites?
-What do you mean?



I mean, are you interested
in doing the rewrites or...



-No.
-...do you wanna sell the script outright?



No, I don't want somebody else
mucking around with my script.



Good.



-Oh, hey, did you talk to your dad?
-Don't ask.



-Why? What did he say?
-My father tells me...



if I dare set foot back in Egypt,
he will have me beheaded.



As in....



-Look. voila.
-Oh, hey. Yeah.



Sorry you don't have an agent.



But let's....



What....



Presumably, you are...



Iooking for something universal
in the experience of two gay men...



-which a broader audience will identify with.
-You could say that.



Would that be a true statement?



Now, don't say anything until.... Okay?



Most Americans...



Let's hold all my calls, please, Liz.



...hate gay people.



They hear it's about gay people,
they won't go.



What about Philadelphia?



Philadelphia is a movie about a man
who hates gay people...



and it's been done.



To get people into the movie theaters...



they have to think it's gonna be fun...



or sensational, or some kind of....



Make them feel fantastic about themselves.



No one goes to the movies...



to have a bad time or to learn anything.



-Do we agree with this?
-Yes.



What is important
is what they leave the theater with.



And if they don't enter the theater...



they don't get a chance to leave it.



Is this acceptable to you as a thesis?



No?



No one is going to see The Dying Gaul.



If you could make it with Tom Cruise...



who wouldn't go near it for $100 million...



and get Spielberg to direct...



and release it on 400,000 screens...



no one is going to see...



The Dying Gaul.



Now...



if we make Maurice a woman with AlDS...



and, let's face it,
heterosexuals are getting AlDS...



-in disastrous numbers.... Robert.
-I want nothing to do with that.



We'll make our own version
of The Dying Gaul...



Ioosely based on your script.



Fine.



Or, or.... Wait. Robert!



Fuck.



You didn't let me finish.



Or we'll give you $1 million for your script...



with which you can go out
and write 400 new screenplays...



about gay men with AlDS, without...



whatever's the most important to you.



-lf you want the script so much--
-We think it is good, Robert...



and we will pay you for it.



We will not make The Dying Gaul
with two men in bed...



falling in love, surviving pain,
and all the blah, blah, blah.



It's not gonna happen, ever.



Ever.



Ever!



Where you going, Robert?



You have virtually no idea
what $1 million would mean to me in my life.



I'm still paying off my college loans.



I've written 15 spec scripts
which no one will buy.



I'm paying child support.



And Malcolm, who just died, my agent,
was also my lover.



I'm sorry.



So, I can't, in good conscience,
take this money from you.



You are an amazing
and lovely person, Robert...



and you have succeeded
in making me feel like a total scumbag.



Good. I'm glad.



-How's your health?
-I'm negative.



-Good.
-Maurice and l.... Malcolm.



God.



-Can't I write you another script?
-We want The Dying Gaul...



and we want you to write it.



Take the million.



Write something else.



-Hello?
-Hi.



I knew you'd be up.



Hi.



I made $1 million.



-How?
-I sold a script. Isn't that incredible?



After all this time,
I wanted to call you and Mark first.



I'm gonna put a third of it aside
for his college fund.



Is he awake?



Well...



-I'm happy for you, Robert.
-Wait. Don't go yet, Kelli.



You ragged on me 17 ways
when I didn't come to Malcolm's memorial.



-I'm sorry.
-You know I don't have money.



-That isn't why you didn't come.
-Well.



Well, okay.



I'd really....



It would mean a lot to me
to share this with my son.



It's 2:00 in the morning, honey.



Okay.



Well, I'll call some other time.



Okay. Bye-bye.



I love you.



What?



We got it



Congratulations. May I read it?



Well, it's gonna change.



Before it does, may l?



-Please?
-Sure.



Hey. What's wrong?



Robert?



Tell me.



Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.



It's gonna be a beautiful movie.



And you are gonna write more movies.



And soon you're gonna be able
to write your own ticket.



I mean that, Robert.



Look at Spike Lee.
He writes movies he cares about...



about his own people,
and they make money.



I want that for you, Robert.



Give me a hug.



Come on.



Okay?



You are very handsome.



And I'm getting a little turned on.



Are you?



You can do anything you want,
as long as you don't call it what it is.



Understand?



Max, Debbon, I want you to meet someone.
Come on.



Hurry. Hurry.



What? Yes. That's why I'm not doing it.



Robert is a screenwriter
like Mommy used to be.



What a nice hat you have on.



She's going through a phase.



-Bath time.
-No!



-Did I ask your opinion? Go!
-No! No!



Everyday!



Hey, could you be louder?
Did you offer him something to drink?



Exactly.



-You have a child, Jeffrey says.
-Yeah. In New York.



-Do you miss it? Screenwriting?
-Oh, God, no.



I could only write the kinds of scripts
that Jeff would never make.



These agapanthus are beautiful.



-You know flowers?
-Elaine...



-offer him something.
-Can I offer you something to drink?



Well, I feel like I should say spring water,
but I'd really like a vodka.



-Peppered? Lemon? Ketel One?
-I'll drink them all and stay all night.



Just a plain.



But you should....



Some of these plants.



Okay. Yes. That's why I depend on you.



Some view, huh? Yes.



Okay.



There are days I wake up early....



Okay. God love you.



I'll look out and think,
"This is actually my home."



When is someone gonna march in here...



-and demand their keys back?
-Oh, God.



I wanna suck on you
till there isn't a drop left...



and lick you from head to toe
and have you inside....



Foreign markets and video.



You're gonna be able to have
a second house looking down on us.



Oh, everyone looks down on us.
That's nothing.



-Cheers, Robert.
-Thanks.



What does that mean?



-I'll make a call, then we'll go.
-Okay.



What part of town do you live in, Robert?



Oh, God,
I live in West Hollywood in a rental.



Not for long.



-I don't wanna change anything, for now.
-Oh, you will. You will.



Elevator going up, up and up.



The context shifts. Things you thought
were luxuries become essential.



-Cheers.
-Cheers.



Suddenly your decisions are impelled...



by your desire
to own another Balthus, or Bacon.



This is the first money he's ever seen
in his life.



-He's not thinking about--
-No?



Decide for yourself.



Cheers.



Hello? Yeah.



No, fuck him. Fuck him!



No, tell him I said it.



I'm perfect.... Okay, this is my message...



"Fuck you, Scott."



Fuck. If he asks why I'm angry,
tell him I said, "Fuck you."



Okay? No, I'll put it on vibrate.



-Jeff.
-All right, all right.



-I hate these test screenings.
-Why are you here, then?



I hear about a project for years, sometimes,
and I never meet the writers...



until we come to the mall.



I think they should spell it M-A-U-L.



Thanks, Danny.



I insisted on meeting you...



before I had to see you
completely crestfallen...



if your movie ever does get made.
Shaken, trembling, cast aside.



And Jeff made you sound like...



there was a glint of a human being
in there...



so I had to see for myself.



Hi.



He's gay!



Who's this mother fucker?



Keep your eyes on the road.



I can't stand it. Excuse me.



The road ahead of you instead.



Okay.



You suck on that, okay?



Robert, your script is so beautiful.



-Don't become one of them, all right?
-I won't.



-I'm sorry about your friend.
-So, what'd you guys think, huh?



-When did he die?
-January.



Of this year?



So, you're.... Oh, God.



Rough.



Sides of me, things I didn't even know
existed have sprung up and taken over.



-Such as?
-I'm, like, famished for distraction.



-Such as?
-I don't know.



I can sit for days on end, literally, though,
surfing the lnternet.



Do you do those chat rooms?



-What? He doesn't have to answer.
-I don't mind.



-I love them, actually.
-Here we go. Wish me luck.



They're like life after death, I think.



How so?



Well, there's no corporeal being.
There's just all these voices, you know?



Well, no, I haven't tried them, so....



Well...



you can make up anything
about yourself, right?



Right.



And do you know anything
about Buddhism?



A bit.



Buddhists believe in karma.



It's like the cumulative effect
of all our actions.



And that's what it's like...



just all this karma colliding
in the middle of nowhere.



What's your favorite really dirty chat room?



Well...



I like MenOnAParkBench, for one.



Park bench?



Yes!



To be continued.



Through the roof.



-Oh, that's great.
-lsn't that great?



Oh, I thought it was shit.



-That is the nicest person.
-lsn't he?



And the most fun I've had
with anybody in the industry in years.



Good.



-Hey, I'm in the industry.
-You are the industry.



You coming to bed?



I think I'm gonna just, you know,
check on some things.



Hi. You've reached Robert Sandrich.
Leave a message.



Listen, I hope that wasn't too weird tonight.



She never goes to these things,
but she insisted on meeting you. So....



She's...



...incredibly smart and frustrated
and working on herself.



Just being with you
got me dripping tonight.



So sweet dreams.



Thanks again
for putting up with all the hoopla.



I don't think so.



Yes.



-Hello.
-Okay.



Good luck.



Watch, watch!



-You okay? Sorry.
-Excuse me.



Excuse me.



Look who emerged. How are you?



-Shrimp with saffron?
-Hey, look who's here.



Nothing. Thanks, anyway.



-Oh, hey.
-You a vegetarian?



-You're not a Buddhist or something?
-Yes, he is.



-Well....
-Yes.



-Here, that's got vegetables in it.
-Jeff.



-How's the revision going?
-It's going great.



-No?
-No.



-It's going great.
-It's not.



-Well, make him help.
-He's the one who wants you...



-to change your perfect script. Perfect.
-I've offered, believe me.



Storm his office and demand
he spend the entire day and....



-Hi, Elaine.
-Hey, Abe.



I need to find a great lawyer.



My 14-year-old
somehow managed to find a way...



to hack into
the Defense Department database.



Why don't you spend
just an hour or so at my office?



-Okay.
-Really?



That was.... You all right?



You sure?



Robert?



-Hi. You thought I was avoiding you, right?
-A little.



Are you all right?



-You should pull that out.
-This? Why?



I've been meaning to tell you.



That right there is monkshood,
and over there.



The roots are dangerous.



-Really?
-Yes. Deadly.



I saw that. I saw that look.



You okay?



It was used...



to make spearhoods, spearheads,
and at executions...



-You sure you're all right?
-Yes.



...in primitive cultures.



It shuts down the entire
central nervous system completely.



You have to eat the roots, but still.



I don't think our children
will be eating roots.



-How do you know all this?
-Malcolm. He loved gardening.



I'm sorry.



He taught me stuff.



I think you should drink. Here.



Thank you.



I'm gonna stay up a bit.



-You wanna take a bath with me?
-I'm wired.



I need to pace, or something.



-You all right?
-Too much coffee.



-Okay.
-I'll be in.



Go away.



Anyone here ever lost a friend or lover?



I have.



It's only been a few weeks.



It gets worse.



Do you ever think of killing yourself?



All the time. See a shrink.



Oh, God.



-Got any recommendations?
-Yes, Marta Foss in Santa Monica.



-She's great.
-Do you see her?



Used to, for eons. My boyfriend did too.



-How did he die?
-TB of the brain.



They drilled holes into his skull
and injected the meds right into his brain...



an experiment that didn't work,
and put him through hell.



Did you help him die?



Damn it.



Hello?



Yes.



I'm sorry.



-I've never told anyone.
-Wow. How come?



Can't say.



Oh, God.



My grief has me thinking
I'm losing my mind.



-Is that natural?
-Yes.



What does one do?



Trawl these rooms
and sleep with all the wrong people.



Like me? You don't wanna fuck me?



I've already sort of got somebody.



Who?



-Oh, just some guy.
-Tell me.



-It isn't interesting.
-I'm interested.



Well, he's my boss on a project...



married, has two kids. I really like his wife.



See? Told you.



Sounds hot!



Well, you know how to reach me
if you change your mind.



Okay. See a shrink.



"Then, as Kabumpo
shook his head again"....



-Are you asleep?
-No.



Please, God, don't let me eat this child.



"Anxious.... Oh. Then as Kabumpo
shook his head again...



"the big boxer started off"....



Catch it. Catch it.



I'm sorry.



Hey, hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.



Baby. It's okay.



-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.



-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.



It's okay, baby. It's all right.



Don't be. Don't be sorry.



-You are so beautiful.
-No, I'm not.



I'll be the judge of that, thank you.



-You wouldn't like me if you really knew me.
-Yeah?



Would you care to elaborate?



-No.
-Good.



-Hello?
-Yeah, we got it all.



-What?
-Everything.



There was this ant when I was meditating,
right after Malcolm's funeral.



It was a big red ant and it bit me.



And I couldn't kill it...



because I thought, "What if that's him?"



But...



now....



And what about what I flush
down the drain without even meaning to?



Spiders and...



stomping on them...



microbes.



Everything I feel...



or touch, is a potential slaughter.



You lived. He didn't.



That's all.



Are you seeing someone, Robert?



What do you mean?



A shrink?



Oh, no, I did. But not now.



Why did you stop?



I didn't want....



Thank you.



-I don't know.
-It's none of my business.



No, it's not that.



But are you?



-No.
-What?



Seeing someone.



You gotta use this.



You gotta promise to use this.



It's too fucking wacky.



Make something good of this. Promise me.



I promise.



Traitor.



What?



Hi, DG.



Hi.



-Can I sit beside you?
-Sure.



Do you mind if we just talk?



No.



-How are you feeling?
-Okay.



-You sure?
-Yeah.



You seem sad.



Do I know you?



Yes.



Sorry, I don't remember our chatting.



Look at my name.



You're an angel?



Yes.



Does that mean you do nice things?
Is that what makes you an angel?



That's part of it.



Did you have a different name
when we talked?



Yes.



What was it?



If I tell you, you'll go away.



Okay. So, did we have sex?



Yes.



-More than once?
-Yes.



-Really?
-Yes.



Tell me what I like.



You're extremely versatile.
You like kissing most of all.



Am I right?



Go on.



You prefer it first thing in the morning...



but nights are also good.



Was I drunk? Did I tell you all this?



You like me to put a finger inside you
while I'm sucking you.



Tell me who this is.



No, I just wanted to say hi.



-Wait.
-Okay.



Did I date you?



Yes.



Wow. Male or female?



Male.



That narrows the field, a bit.



You've had your share.



How many men have I slept with?



A dozen or so. No, 18 to be exact.



-Who is this?
-Don't be afraid.



Dr. Foss?



She doesn't know
how many men you've slept with.



Tony?



-He doesn't even have a computer.
-How do you know that?



From up here I can see a lot.



It's difficult getting through.
It's taken me a long time.



I want to know who the fuck this is.



I love you, Robert.



I'll always love you.
Don't worry about selling the script.



Jeffrey?



Jeffrey doesn't know what we did in bed.
He just wants to get fucked.



Please tell me who this is.



-You know who I am.
-Who?



I'm with you every night. When you close
your eyes, I curl up next to you.



Say your name.



I know I couldn't stand that closeness,
being against you as we slept.



Malcolm?



I sleep with you and walk with you.



Is this Malcolm? Stop this, whoever this is.



-Sweet dreams, baby.
-God, please don't leave.



I'll never leave you.
I'm with you through eternity.



Malcolm?



Malcolm?



Yes, baby, yes.
I'm right here. And you're safe.



Write me tomorrow, little Bubber.
You're my little Bubber, okay?



Sweet dreams, baby. I'm....



Bye.



-Hello?
-Was that you?



'Cause I swear to Christ, Jeff,
if that was you, I'll kill you.



-What are you talking about?
-I mean that.



Okay.



I am fucked up enough to do it.



What's wrong, Robert?



-You swear that wasn't you?
-What?



Okay.



What's the matter?



Okay. Okay.



-I'm sorry. Goodnight.
-Hey, wait.



E?



Hey.



-Oh, sorry.
-Come to bed.



I wonder why Robert
never talks about his wife and son.



I wouldn't be able to stop thinking
about you if something happened to us.



Do you think....



Do you think it has something to do
with Malcolm?



-Maybe.
-I just worry. So much to deal with.



-Dr. Foss?
-Robert.



What's wrong? Come in.



-Sorry to bother you.
-It's all right. Come, sit.



-I just have to ask you a question, that's all.
-All right.



Are you ArckAngell?



I'm not sure....



Are you? Just say yes or no.



-I don't know what you mean. ArckAngell?
-Are you ArckAngell?



-'Cause if you are....
-Robert, have you taken something?



-Never mind. I'm just really sorry.
-No. I haven't heard from you in months.



Something is obviously distressing you.



Just forget all of this.
It was good to see you.



I'd like you to come and see me,
today, if possible.



We'll see. Thank you.



I expect to hear from you, Robert.



All right?



Hello. You got my e-mail?



Just now.



-Do you remember the principles?
-Of course.



I can't stay long this time.



I need assurances this is you.



I taught you to dig bottoms.
You were once a bottom. My dog bottom.



Then we found out I was positive
and I couldn't risk infecting you.



What else?



Remember the time right after I died,
you were meditating and there was an ant?



You remember the time I'm talking about?



Maybe.



It might be me, you thought, reborn.



You thought if it was born
the instant I left my body....



But life is like a current.
It flows through the ant...



and you and me.



Indivisible.



Look within.



More, I need more.



I fight to get through.



What is it like where you are?



Jeff!



Everything is wet now.



Hello?



I can see from here
that you will survive and go on to flourish.



-Hey.
-Hi.



-Is Jeffrey there?
-Hold on a sec.



Where did you go?



Jeff! Phone!



-Can you take a message?
-I'm on the toilet!



-Hello?
-Hi, it's me.



Robert? Hello?



-You all right?
-Yeah. I'm here....



I hear clicking.



I'm still here.



I'm typing up some....



I'm not Jeffrey.



You keep testing me.
I'm not Jeffrey. I'm not Foss.



You through?



So, what was that about last night?



Jeffrey obviously isn't clever enough...



to talk on the phone with you
and send you IMs at the same time.



Just....



Just what?



Sorry, I had some thoughts
about the script...



-and I wondered if I could see you.
-Today?



-Well, yeah, that would....
-Are you still there?



Yes.



-That would....
-Yeah, today.



-You sound really distracted, my friend.
-I am. Let me call you back.



Or what time could we....



Why don't we meet at my office
around 3:00?



-Do you remember The Middle Way?
-When? I'm sorry.



3:00. At my office.



-Robert, I'm not Jeffrey.
-Wait.



Okay, that's great. Is Elaine there?



I have to leave now.



Elaine? She's in the bathroom.



No, I'm all yours.



Are you sure?



All mine what?



Am I sure? Yes.



-Are you sure you're all right?
-Now.



-Yes, sorry.
-Meaning?



Okay. Bye.



Robert?



-Really, I am. I'll see you.
-I'm all yours now.



I'm sorry. Bye.



Okay.



I can only prove myself to you this one time.



If you don't believe, I'm gone.



Okay.



I'll tell you something Jeffrey doesn't know.



Kelli is my sister.



You left her and Mark for me.



I'll tell you something Foss doesn't know.



You've been drinking again...



and you've stopped meditating
and going to the gym.



-What you doing?
-Honey, I'm working.



-Please don't distract me, okay?
-Sorry.



Here is something no one knows.



You killed me.



You stopped my heart
when I might have gone on living.



You couldn't stand to see me suffer.



You stole potassium chloride from
the nurse's cart and injected it into my Iv.



I can't stay.



Wait!



What's with the fucking phone calls?
Are you out of your mind, huh?



-I thought somebody was fucking with me.
-Who?



-I don't wanna talk about it.
-How come?



Because it's resolved itself.



And I can't know about it?



You don't like secrets, do you?



No, I just, l....



I care about you.



No.



No. You just want a good script.



Once we go into production,
you're gonna dump me like that.



-ls that what you think?
-I don't know.



I can't tell anything about anything.



Malcolm, if this is you...



I know you think I've betrayed you,
sleeping with this man.



I feel so lost.



I don't love him...



or want to hurt his marriage.
His wife is about...



the only kind, loving person I know.



I don't want to do anything to anger him...



because he holds my future in his hands.



I think he's just using me for sensation...



because his marriage has gotten routine.



I don't think we'll last.



I need you to forgive me.



I'll end it as soon as I've finished the script.



I know you must...



judge me for changing the screenplay.



And I don't know how you feel...



about...



what happened our last day...



at the hospital.



You were in such pain...



and the doctors said...



that you would never recover.



That's what they were saying, isn't it?



I'm afraid I've lost your love...



and your pain hurts me more
than mine could ever. Please, Malcolm....



Please, God, let this be real,
let this really be you.



I love you more than I love my own life.



I want to be with you through eternity.



Now.



I can't bear this,
the pain of being without you.



You are my body and my heart...



and anything that is decent
and worthwhile in me.



And you are gone.



I want to be melded.



If you tell me to kill myself, I will.



Please, tell me what to do. Oh, please.



Do you love Elaine?



Yes.



I did once, very much. I really did.



And now?



Yes.



If, but....



If I could have seen the future...



maybe....



Sometimes I think, if it weren't
for Max and Debbon, you know....



You'd divorce her?



Yes.



Or....



Did you ever see
Crimes and Misdemeanors?



What? You'd kill her?



No.



-Stop--
-No. No, not really, not....



It's just a fantasy.



What? You never fantasize?



Mr. Moral, you never fantasize
about Malcolm?



You never saw him suffering...



and thought, "Christ,
I wish I could put him out of his misery?"



No. I never wanted to see him die, ever.



-Okay, I'm a jerk.
-Ever.



Dearest Bubber...



you did exactly as I hoped you would do...



and you have never done anything
short of the miraculous.



No one could have loved me as you did...



and you must go on living and writing.



The movie is a good thing...



and the money is, too,
if you use it for good.



I may not be able
to keep doing this for long.



I will watch over you,
and you will never put a foot wrong.



I will protect you. I promise.



Trust yourself.



Kelli will forgive you, and you and she
and Mark, will grow close again.



And you will have a long lifetime
of love and challenging work.



You deserve these things.



I will try to reach you when I can...



but you must know
that I am always with you...



always loving you, always saying yes.



Yes, for all of eternity, Robert.



And you must never doubt that,
never doubt my devotion to you...



and my gratitude.



Don't press your luck
or Robert will grow tired...



and want to break your spirit
as much as the rest of us.



I will hear you always.



So please be good to yourself.



Remember, suffering is a disease...



from which everyone may be truly cured.



Look within: thou art Buddha.



I love you.



I love you, too.



-You're so good.
-Oh, right.



No, you are.



I think I see parts of you
that no one else does.



And you don't know
how much goodness there is in there...



just waiting to stir up a storm.



It's time for you to start letting me go now.



No.



Yes, it is.



-Wait, what do I do?
-About?



Everything. Jeffrey?



Your love is like a beacon.



Anyone who crosses its path
will shine and be dazed.



Let him play, but be careful.



Is he falling in love with me?



Self-salvation is for any man
the immediate task.



You don't like him.



I will not pass judgment on this man.



I don't want to be responsible
for hurting anyone.



It isn't in your nature.



I want it to end gently.



You don't think he'd actually leave Elaine?



Only he knows what's in his heart.



What do you think, though?



I suspect he said that
to make you feel better.



Look within.



Sometimes...



I don't know, it's almost like...



he enjoys making Elaine look ridiculous.



Putting his dick in my hand
when she's in the house. Stuff like that.



And I don't want to wreck their marriage.



You couldn't.



You don't have that power.



I can't believe he talked about killing her.



You don't think he'd actually do it, do you?



Anything special you want today,
Miss Tishop?



-No, thank you.
-Okay, very well.



Are you there?



Yes.



He would, or you're there?



Emad, I don't want you to clean today.
Come tomorrow.



I need to concentrate on my work
and be alone.



Okay, very well.



Okay....



Only he knows what's in his heart.



He's so used to lying to get what he wants,
and he has...



so much money,
he could probably get away with it.



He seemed so guilty and ashamed
when he said it.



You will have many loves...



but I will have only one for all time.



Forgive.... Forgive yourself.



I feel you.



There's....



There's a disturbance.



Hi, you've reached Bella.



I'm either on the phone or out of range.
Leave a message.



Call me right away. It's urgent.



Hello?



-Hey.
-Hey.



What?



We have to talk.



Okay.



Something.... Now?



Robert's gonna come by to work in a bit,
15 minutes or so.



I need a little time alone.



-What's wrong?
-And then I need...



-some time alone with you.
-Okay.



Robert's not coming for the meeting.



-He's not? He called?
-I know.



-You know?
-Please...



don't insult me. It would be very bad
if you did anything now...



to try to convince me
that it isn't or hasn't happened.



-What has?
-Because then I would know you...



to be a liar and I have...



concrete proof of what has taken place,
is continuing.



I don't....



Already you're fouling the water
of what could only...



possibly be some kind of peace between us.



But...



you can't say another word...



or lie to me or I will leave you for good.



Thank you.



I need a little time to get over the fact
of what he showed me.... Facts.



Don't make me elaborate
about this right now, please, Jeffrey.



All right.



I'm asking you
to give me some time here by myself...



and then the two of us
can sit down together...



and work out
what we're going to have or not.



Look, I promise,
I swear, I won't see him anymore.



I'll give the movie to somebody else.
I'll fire him.



-That would be a start, but--
-Can you tell me what he said?



If you insist on grilling me,
then we can have it out now...



but I can't guarantee
what conclusions I'll reach.



All right, okay.



Go away. Come back at 6:30.



I'll kill him.



I would never hurt you on purpose.



Should I pick up the kids or....



They're at Shoshi's.



She's taking them for the night.



You sure?



I want to be alone with you.



I love you, E.



That's all I'm going to say.



-Hello?
-Oh, God. Where are you?



About eight minutes from home.
Did you call before?



If you see Jeffrey, don't stop to talk to him.



Turn off on a side street right now.



Don't let him see you if you can help it.



But if he does for some reason, don't stop.



-Call me back, all right?
-Hello?



-Oh, I have to go.
-Jeffrey?



Hello? Jeffrey?



-The door was unlocked.
-He had to cancel your appointment.



He said he couldn't get back here
until 6:30, at the earliest.



Oh, well.



Excuse me.



-Have him, Robert.
-What?



Have him. Please. Take him.



It will help my suit
if you're both more open about it.



Is there anything you want to say to me?



Robert, what is unconditional love like?



Can you tell me?



How do you....



Where do you find it in yourself...



to give, much less get?



I'm not even thinking about that.
That would be...



too terrible to contemplate.



Sit, please.



You and Malcolm...



where did you find it in yourself?



How did you manage to put up with all the,
literally, the shit?



So much compromise.



I never lied to him.



Or accepted one from him.



We simply said, "No more lies."



If you had to venture a guess,
in order to help me...



you would say...



I failed to see. I did....



I did what, from your perspective?



I would say....



I would say...



that you are responsible for all of it.



All the things that make us feel like victims,
it's a lesson.



Look within. No one is ever a victim.



Look for what is positive.



Well, good.



I'll look for the positive
in you fucking Jeffrey...



behind my back over and over again.



And all the while....
No, you will not walk out of here.



All the while,
I'm trying to be generous to you.



Don't do me any favors.



Self-salvation is for any man
the immediate task.



Please tell Jeffrey I'd stopped by.



ArckAngell is dead, Robert.



What?



He had to be...



deleted from his hard drive.



He doesn't even have a floppy anymore.



Nothing.



Self-salvation for all of us. Thanks.



How?



The nice thing is, you will never know.



Thieves and hackers,
unlike screenwriters, feel no need...



to leave their name emblazoned
all over their work.



I'm very sorry.



Forgive me?



-Hey.
-Hello.



Hey.



Here's Pinky. Pinky.



And your backpack.



You know what?
We're going to go visit Aunt Catherine.



Yay! Oh, let me drive.



Robert, open up.



Robert, I need to talk to you.



-Hang on.
-I've been calling you for hours.



-What the fuck, Robert!
-Jesus Christ! Hang on.



What did you say to her?



-Elaine?
-Yes, Elaine!



-What did you show her?
-Nothing. Nothing.



I don't believe you.



-I'm sorry.
-Tell me what you did.



I just went over there for our meeting
and she was all riled up.



Oh, yes, and you did nothing.
You said nothing.



No!



Nothing to her at all?



I said she should speak to you.



I was sorry.



You're sorry?



You are....



You are sorry.



Do I seem
enshrouded in illusion to you, Robert?



Do I seem less real to you?



I'm sorry if I don't live up to your standards.
The trouble is, I'm bisexual.



I like both. You want the truth?



But you're lucky to be only one thing.
I'm not. I'm not hiding in my marriage!



I need my marriage!



And not just for business reasons.



Jesus, half of Hollywood's
out of the fucking closet.



They're all on the covers of magazines,
proclaiming their pride.



Were you so....



I'm sorry I corrupted your poor little....



Give back the money
if it makes you feel so unhappy...



you have to piss in other people's wells.



I did not say anything to Elaine.



-She was very freaked out. She said...
-Yes, I got the note.



...that she had figured it out.



And I said that I was very sorry.



You have no reason to tell me the truth.



I have no reason to lie.



You don't think
that she'd try to hurt herself?



Yeah. Any word?



No. What? Tell me.



Tell me now.



No, I'm not driving.



Are they alive?



Tell me if they're alive.



Yes, Officer.



I would like to know
just the truth now, please.



No one survived the crash, sir.
They ran into a retaining....



The children are safe?



Sir.



A little boy and a little girl?
Max and Debbon?



There were two children in the vehicle.
Yes, sir.



All of them?



We can send someone for you.



There is going to be
the matter of identification.



I'm sorry to have to have....



Oh, God!



Help....



She drove them into a wall.
