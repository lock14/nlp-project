<i>♪ Happy birthday, ♪
♪ dear Janice ♪</i>



<i>♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪</i>



It's my
anorexic boss' birthday.



This means there's a certain
amount of inter-office pressure



to stand around
the conference table



eating crappy food and
pretending to worship her.



That's so good.



Acting for five minutes like Janice
doesn't make all our lives miserable



is the hardest work
I'll do all day.



My job title
is account manager.



I used to be called an account
service representative,



but a consultant told us we
needed to manage our clients



and not service them.



I have a girlfriend whom
I neither manage nor service.



That's my best friend, Barry, fucking
her on an lKEA kitchen table



I picked up
for a really good price.



I'm finding it hard to care
about anything these days.



In fact, the only thing I do care about is
the fact that I can't care about anything.



Seriously. It worries me.



My name is Wesley Gibson.



My dad walked out on my mom
when I was seven days old.



Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked into
my baby blues eyes and asked himself,



"Did I just father the most insignificant
asshole of the 21st century?"



Well, if you could get me the
consignment to me by the 28th... Yeah.



Do you have the numbers
in front of you?



Relax.



If your name had come up,
you'd be dead already.



We've had some
unexpected losses recently.



We'd like to know



where our competitor
is getting his munition.



It's clean.



Meaning?



Meaning it's untraceable.



Your competitor's very smart.



Get down!



Fuck it.



No one leaves
the Fraternity, Cross.



I have a new perspective
on the Fraternity.



Careful.



You don't destroy something that's
been around for a thousand years.



It's already destroyed.
He broke the code.



I have to stop this.



Really?
You know this.



So why don't you
face me yourself?



Never send sheep
to kill a wolf.



They were just
the decoys.



Goodbye, Mr. X.



Never send sheep
to kill a wolf.



They were just
the decoys.



Wesley!



What is it?



What do you mean,
"What is it"? Listen.



Well, how am I suppose to sleep
with all that fucking racket?



When are we gonna move so we don't
have to wake up to that shit?



I kind of like it.



It helps to drown out the sound
of your annoying, fucking voice.



Now, please, let me sleep.



Have you even thought
about our talk?



Yes.



Which one?



Perfect. That's perfect.



Feed Annabelle.



Sorry.



Oh, my fucking God.



I hope that's not my billing
report sitting on your desk.



Holy shit on an altar, it is.



I want that report
on my desk in one hour.



Okay, everybody, we're all
gonna stay an extra hour...



Want to hear
something sad?



I need an ergonomic keyboard to keep
my repetitive stress injury in check.



Just the fact that I repeat
something enough



that it causes me
stress is fucking sad.



Nice job, dude.
You seen Barry?



He had to go to the dentist.
Again.



Yes!



Barry!



You think they have that
morning-after pill here?



That thing works. Crush it
up, put it in her omelet,



"Hey, baby, breakfast in bed."
You can never be too safe.



Oh, God.



I lost my wallet
somewhere.



All this together?



No, no.
Yes.



He is the man.



How much is it?
Oh. Plus this.



$20.42.



Watermelon.



Chicks dig it.



Thanks.



See you next time.



Have a good night.



I love these
energy drinks, man.



I'm almost, like, kind of on
an energy drink cleanse,



where I do one for breakfast and
then, like, two or three for lunch.



I'm the man?



Yeah, right,
Barry, I'm the man.



In fact, I'm so much the man,



I have a standing prescription for
medication to control my anxiety attacks.



God, I wish I had something
else to relieve my stress.



Hello, Wesley.



You know, there are
people, beautiful people,



you just wish they could see you in a
different setting, a different place,



instead of where you are,
what you've become.



Nicole is so hot.



What?



Boom goes the dynamite.



But most of all, you wish
you weren't such a pussy



for wishing for things
that will never change.



Good God A'mighty, you're over here
like it's spring fucking break,



and I still don't have
that billing report.



Why do I even
keep you around, Wesley?



I'll get it done, Janice.



Like I never heard that before.
"I'll get it done."



"I'll get it done.
I'll get it done, Janice.



"I'll get it done."



Why don't you have anything
to say for yourself?



I'm sorry.



Well, you're worthless.



I'm the one who's sorry
I hired your ass.



You know what the best thing
is about the end of the day?



Tomorrow it starts
all over again.



Hi. How you doing?
Good.



I'm sorry?
You apologize too much.



Sorry about that.



I knew your father.



My father left the
week I was born, so...



Your father died yesterday on the
rooftop of the Metropolitan Building.



Sorry.



Look, the liquor rounds
are just over there, so...



Your father was one of the
greatest assassins who ever lived.



The man who killed him
is behind you.



This guy's just
shooting up...



Sorry. Sorry.



What... Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What the fuck just happened?



Please! Please!
Please drive faster.



Please be quiet. Please drive...
Please drive faster.



Please... Please understand
that I care about my life!



I don't know what the fuck
you did to piss this guy off,



but you're gonna have to let
me out and call the cops!



Hey! Hey!



What are you doing?
Oh, shit! Are you crazy?



Oh, shit!



I think we lost him.
I think we lost him.



Could you let me out
at the next corner, please?



Shit!



Fuck!



Oh, shit!



He's right there!



Look, I'm an accountant.
I'm just an accountant.



Oh, fuck!



He's fucking persistent,
you know.



Fuck!



You kick his ass!



Shoot him!



What are you doing? What are
you shooting our car for, huh?



Are you crazy?
Grab the wheel.



Where are you going?



Get back in here!



Oh, my God!



Oh, damn! I'm sorry.



Gun!
What?



Under the seat!



Here.



Oh, shit!



Shit!



Look out!
Get out!



Look out! Oh, my God!



Shit!



I'm sorry!



Behind you!



Fuck.



Shit. Shit.



Hello.



I don't have any money or...



I thought he'd be



taller.



Taller?



Sir...



Sir, I've been trying to explain to
the lady here that I'm an accountant.



I'm an account service representative...
I'm an account manager.



And I'm sure that if you
call my boss, Janice,



she'd fill you in on
whatever has gone wrong.



You can contact her by email or...
She'll put you straight.



Shoot the wings
off the flies.



I don't know
what that means.



Shoot the wings
off the flies.



I really think you have me
mixed up with somebody else.



On three.



Either you shoot,
or I do.



One.



Okay.



Two.



I can't even see them!



Three.



Okay. Okay.



That's impossible.



A lot of things for you weren't
possible before today.



What you experienced, Wesley,
was not a panic attack.



Your heart was beating in
excess of 400 beats per minute,



sending abundant amounts of
adrenaline into your bloodstream.



This allows you to see
and react faster than normal.



Only a few people
in the world can do that.



Your father could do it
and you can do it.



With a little work, you can
learn to control these attacks.



Stay away from me.



Just stay back from me.



I have a gun, sir.
All right?



My name is Sloan.



This is Fox.



And the others you see around you
are all very good at killing.



So, if I were you, I'd keep
the gun pointed at me.



You don't wanna
point it at any of them.



That's better.



You're insane.
No.



Insanity is wasting
your life as a nothing



when you have the blood of a
killer flowing in your veins.



Insanity is being shit on,
beat down,



coasting through life
in a miserable existence



when you have a caged lion locked
inside and a key to release it.



This gun you're holding is an Imanishi 17.
It belonged to your father.



He could conduct a symphony
orchestra with it.



And you're going to use it to kill the
man who shot him down in cold blood.



I can't... The same man who
tried to kill you tonight.



Your father was one of us.



A fraternity of assassins.
The weapons of fate.



We've transferred all of
his assets over to you.



And let me assure you,
they are substantial.



It is your
long-awaited destiny



to join us.



Back off. Back off.



You don't know
anything about me.



Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.



You stay away from me?



You stay away from me, please?
Will you let me through?



You know when you have a
dream and you're half awake,



but it's still in
the fringe of your brain?



Then you open your eyes and you're
so damn glad it was a dream.



This was nothing like that.



I'm sorry. Could you just give
me one second? Thank you.



Oh, shit.



Wesley.



Hey.



What's up with you?



What do you mean?



You're... You're here early.



Is... You seem
a little pepped up.



You all right?
Well, yeah.



Yeah.



I guess I feel



kind of different.



Whatever. I'm gonna go get some
Post-it Notes. Do you want one?



No.
Really?



Yeah.
Okay.



Jesus H. fucking Popsicle, I still
don't have my billing reports,



but you've got time to sit
here and Google your ass off.



Well, I know one thing.



You've got your review
coming up next week,



and I can't wait to start checking
me off some big fucking boxes.



Attitude, poor!
Performance, poor!



Management skills, poor!



Works well with others.
That's a fucking joke.



What is this bullshit?
Who's this prick?



Some loser gets his head blown
off at the Metropolitan...



Shut the fuck up!



She has one single
iota of tenuous power.



She thinks she can
push everyone around.



You don't need this.



I understand.



Junior high must have
been kind of tough,



but it doesn't give you the right to treat
your workers like horseshit, Janice.



I know we laugh at you,
Janice.



We all know you keep your stash of jelly
donuts in the top drawer of your desk.



But I want you to know



if you weren't such a bitch,
we'd feel sorry for you.



I do feel sorry for you.



But as it stands,
the way you behave,



I feel I can speak
for the entire office



when I tell you



go fuck yourself.



Yeah. That was great, bro.
Who's the man?



I'm the man.



That's a bad idea.



Couldn't find
your keys, huh?



That could be handy.
You going to teach me that?



I might need that.



So, Fox, right? What is that?
Is that a call sign?



Is it like Maverick
in Top Gun?



You could tell me,
but you'd have to kill me?



I'm just kidding.



Peter!



Check the shuttle rotation on this STB.
It should be 300 per minute.



This kind of cotton weave, the
opposing thread count should be 4,000.



Hey, this is
pretty awesome, huh?



Is it a front?



Front for what?
I don't know.



Assassinations.



You may think this is
a front for something,



all I can tell you
is this is a textile mill.



And George... George,
go help Peter up there.



Yeah.



This is a textile mill.



And a damn good one.



Yeah, that's cute,
but that's bullshit, right?



I mean, all these guys
are killers, aren't they?



I think you owe me
some answers.



All right.
Clearly I don't understand,



but do you make sweaters
or do you kill people?



That's an awful lot
of questions over coffee.



Are you sure you're
ready for the answers?



Yes, I'm sure.



I can't go back.



Not to my life.



He's all yours.



All right. We're up.



How you doing?



I'm The Repairman.



What do you repair?



A lifetime of bad habits.



Okay.
Would you do me a favor?



Just put your arms
behind your back.



Uh...



It's okay.
I don't know...



Just behind your back.
Is this okay?



Just relax.



Is this part of it?



There we go.



You going to put a bag
over my head?



No.
There's no need for a bag.



That's not too tight, is it?
No, that's nice.



Why did you come here, Wesley?



Well, you brought me here,
remember?



What the fuck
did you do that...



How many punches
did The Repairman throw



before he was counting sheep?



Well, I haven't spent a lot of time having
my face smashed in before, all right?



Did you spend a lot
of time with knives?



At breakfast,
lunch and dinner.



Fuck.



It was a rhetorical
question, culo.



You interrupt me again,
I use the business end.



Here's what you need
to know, puto.



Knives are easy to hide.



They don't jam and they
never run out of bullets.



They come in handy



when you have to do some
close contact work.



What the fuck, man?



Come here. Come here.
What?



Now, try to cut me.
What?



Try to cut me. Hey!



Just stick me with that... Be
careful with that. That's sharp.



Just stick and stick and stick.
Why?



Seriously, man, I could hurt you.
Hey!



Okay, pussy.



I'm not a pussy.
You're a pussy.



No, I'm not a pussy.
You're a pussy!



I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy
respect for the human condition.



Fuck that, you pussy!
I'm not a pussy!



You're a pussy!
I'm not a pussy!



Come on, pussy.
I'm not a pussy!



Hi. How you doing?



What the fuck?



The fuck!



Just a moment.
Just a moment.



Sorry.



Hello? Hey!



Hey, come back! Hey!



You must drink.
Drink. Yeah.



What is this?
This is the recovery room.



This bath stimulates white blood
cells and speed up the process.



In here, bruises, cuts, breaks
heal in hours, not days.



You shitting me?



Shh.



What is that? Vodka?
Yeah.



Are you Russian?
Yeah.



Get up.



This is The Gunsmith.



He knows more about a piece than anybody,
and he's gonna teach you how to use one.



How you doing?
Pretty good.



You know that Seltzer broke his leg?
Oh, really?



Yeah, in three places.



How'd he do that?
Jumped off a building.



So, is he okay? Yeah.
It's pretty bad, though.



Oh, my God.



Oh, my God, you guys,
that is so realistic.



He's been in recovery for,
like, three days now,



and they say they're not even
gonna let him out.



Oh, my God.



Oh, my God.



Oh, my God!



Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman!
She might be somebody's mom...



You need to know what it's like
to put a bullet in a body.



Why are you here?



You know, I thought I was learning
to be some kind of super assassin.



You know,
if I wanted to get beat up,



I would have stayed in
my cubicle, you know.



Fuck.



All right,
shoot the target.



From there.



You want me
shoot through Wilbur?



I want you
to curve the bullet.



How am I suppose to do that?



It's not a question of how,



it's a question of what.



If no one told you
that bullets flew straight



and I gave you a gun and
told you to hit the target,



what would you do?



Let your instincts guide you.



How the hell
did he do that?



Can you do that?
Can you do that? Hello?



Hey, I think
that's my old train.



Still is.



Shit! You fucking asshole!



Come on!



Let's go.



Are you out
of your fucking mind?



Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.



Oh, God, I feel...
I feel... I feel...



I feel kind of good.



He got Rictus. Perfect shot.
Impossible angle.



Cross is taking us out
one by one.



And Wesley is the only one
who can get to him.



Cross gets closer
with each hour.



Get back to work.



See that?



It's a shuttle.
Okay.



I want you to try
and catch it.



You want me to stick
my hand in there?



Yes. I want you to catch it.



You wanna put a gun
to my head?



I can just slow things down
like with the flies.



You need to learn to
control that by yourself.



Fuck, fuck, fuck!



This is bullshit! Fuck this!



How's it going today,
Wesley?



No. Fuck the loom
and fuck The Repairman!



I can shoot the wings off the
back of a fly! I'm ready!



You're ready when Fox
says you're ready.



Who put her in charge?
I did.



Wesley.



People think you use cheese
to catch these beauties.



But they go apeshit
for peanut butter.



Your father was a big fan of this.
Watch.



Plastic explosive
and peanut butter!



Sorry, Mickey.



Five, four, three, two, one.



Hey. Hey, Russian.



Good for one. Yeah.



Imagine if you had
a thousand.



They really fucked you up,
didn't they?



What the hell
did they do to you?



Throw you in front of
a moving train for no reason?



Beat the shit out of you?



You know, you can say it, this place
is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh?



Bullshit!



Repairman. Five minutes.



Heads up out of the question?



Fuck.



You're a waste of my fucking time!
Why are you here?



I don't know, so hit me.



Why are you here? I had a
shit life, so why wouldn't I?



I wanna kick your fucking ass!



Tell me what
you want me to say.



Why are you here?
I don't know!



Why are you here?



Why are you here?
I don't know why I'm here.



Why are you here?



Why are you here?



I don't know who I am.



What did you say?
I said...



I said I don't know who I am.



Do you really want
to know who you are?



Yeah. It's my room.



No.



This was your father's room.



What happened?



A member of this
fraternity went rogue.



Cross.



He started by killing the one
man who was better than him.



Your father.



Blindsided him
on a rooftop.



Betrayed him.



Everything in this room,



books, weapons, clothes,



belonged to him.



Now they belong to you.



Find a connection
in this room, Wesley.



It may be the only way
of finding out who you are.



Now I know why I could never
care about anything before this.



I was living a lie.



Finally, I have a chance to
step into my father's shoes.



Grow a pair. Live the
life I was born to live.



I've been pissing it all away like it
was another fucking billing report.



I have to train harder.



I have to be as good
as my father.



On these shelves, Wesley, are the
records of the Fraternity kills,



everything you will need
to kill your target.



To kill Cross,



the man who betrayed the Fraternity and
murdered my father, I must prepare.



I have to become his student,
memorize every move he ever made,



every attack he ever executed.



When he dropped a patient in an airtight
room surrounded by Secret Service agents.



When he took out that
businessman in the elevator.



His bullets untraceable,
of course.



Or how no matter what the weapon
or how he eliminated his target,



he was always
one chess move ahead.



One move more prepared.



One step quicker.



One shot more precise.



In fact, in all my research, I found
that he never missed a target.



Not until me.



Yeah!



First time in your life,
Wesley, you're in control.



Shoot the target.



You're crazy.



Welcome to the Fraternity.



We call this
the Loom of Fate.



After today, you will never
set foot in here again.



Why not?



Because, like an apostle,



your task is not to interpret,
but to deliver.



Every culture in history
has a secret code,



one you won't find
in traditional texts.



A thousand years ago,



a clan of weavers discovered a mystical
language hidden in the fabric.



They called themselves
the Fraternity.



I'll be honest with you,
all I see are threads.



Come here.



Look there.



Do you see that one thread
that missed the weave



and lies on top of the others?



Like a mistake?
No, it's a code.



If the vertical thread
is on top, it's a one.



If it's below, it's a zero.



Binary code?



What does it say?



It's a name.



A target.



Where do the names
come from?



Come out of a necessity,
Wesley.



A necessity to maintain
balance in the world.



They are orders
that must be executed,



entrusted to us so that we might
forge stability out of chaos.



This one is yours.



I don't...



Look, I thought you brought
me here to kill Cross.



You will.



In time.



This is your first assignment.



The loom provides,



I interpret,



you deliver.



You want me to kill
Robert Deane Darden?



Not me.



Fate.



The target will be in the conference
room, sitting at the head chair.



There are six windows.



You will shoot
through the fifth.



Fifth window.



Now.



What did he do
that he deserves to die?



You don't know.



I don't know if he was bad,
I don't know if he was evil.



I don't know
anything about him.



We get our orders from a loom.



Fate.



And we're suppose to take it on faith
that what we're doing is right.



Killing someone
we know nothing about,



I don't know if I can do that.



About 20 years ago,



there was this girl.



Her dad was a federal judge,



so she probably had it in her mind that
she was gonna follow in his footsteps.



So she's home one Christmas,



and her dad's on this big
racketeering case.



The defendants want
to get a softer judge.



One they can buy off.



So they hire this guy,



Max Petridge,



get him to pay her father
a visit.



And the way he pays
people a visit



is to break in



and tie up their loved ones,



and force them to watch



while he burns
his targets alive.



And then he takes a wire
hanger and twists it round



and brands his initials into each one
of them so they will never ever forget.



After I was recruited
into the Fraternity,



I found out that Max
Petridge's name had come up



weeks before the federal
judge was killed,



and that a Fraternity member had
failed to pull the trigger.



We don't know how far the
ripples of our decisions go.



You kill one, and maybe,



save a thousand.



That's the code
of the Fraternity.



That's what we believe in,
and that's why we do it.



Now!



Cross.



Not yet.



Your target will be
in a black limo.



He always travels the same
six blocks of Halsted.



You have three blocks
to kill him.



Shit.



I'm sorry.



Barry!
Could you feed Annabelle?



Barry!



Wesley. Hey, where have you been?
I have really missed you, man.



Look at the big man.
You fucking asshole! What?



What? You don't
show up for weeks,



now you're just gonna stop by
and use the bathroom?



You think you're a real
big shot now, huh?



No. You know what?
You are nothing!



No, you are less than nothing.



You're not even half
the man that Barry is.



Barry, he pleases me in ways
that you've never even heard of!



Who the hell is she, Wesley?
Your new whore?



Is that what it takes now?
You're paying for it?



Wesley?



He's the man.



You all right?
Yeah.



Yeah. I'm okay. Go sit down.
I'm gonna find a car.



Big night.
I got to get into recovery.



Shit.



Fuck!



Bull's-eye.



What's he doing here?



Come on!
Come on. Just stay with us.



Pull back his jacket.



Breathe. Breathe, all right?



It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.



A thousand.



Come on!



Come on!
No! No! Stay with us.



Come on.
Open your eyes!



Come on!



Come on!



Come on!



This bullet is the first
traceable bullet he's ever used.



It was made by this man.
His name is Pekwarsky.



He works out of what is now a
monastery in Eastern Moravia.



This place is where
the Fraternity was born.



He's taunting me.



He's sending me a message.



I'm gonna send him one back.



He's trapping you.



Leading you to a place
he knows very well.



Look, I know this. I...



This is what
you trained me for.



You can't go alone.



I go alone or he doesn't show.
He's not stupid.



Look, a member of the Fraternity
is dead because of me.



Okay.



Go.



Thank you.



I don't think
that's a good idea.



Your next assignment.



Pekwarsky?



Shit.



What are you doing here?



Lower your gun.



You recognize this?



I pulled this
out of my shoulder.



The guy who put it there
killed my father.



Now, I know you made it,
so tell me where he is.



I did mold this, but I can't be
responsible for the people who use them.



I don't give a shit.
Tell me where he is.



Look at my finger.



I can try and arrange a meet.



Have you ever thought about
doing things differently?



How do you mean?



I don't know.



Being somebody else.



Somebody normal.



No.



Shit.



Out of the way!



Stay.



Hey!



He's on the train.



He's alone.



Thank you.



Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!



Sir, sit down!
Nobody's gonna get hurt.



Sir, sit... Sit down!
Sir, sit down!



Get out of the way! Sit down!
Stay down! Stay down!



Stay down! It's okay!
Sit down!



Wesley.



Out of the way!
Out of the way!



No, no, no!



Wesley, listen to me.



Shut the fuck up!



You don't get to talk to me.



You don't get to talk to me.



Everything they told you
was a lie.



Shut up, you lying piece of shit.
You shut the fuck up.



You are my son.



What did you say?



What did you say to me?



Is it true?



Yes.



Why did you make me do this?



Because you are the only
person he wouldn't kill.



You knew, God damn it.



You knew the entire time.



Well, his name came up.



So did yours.



No, it was okay.
Never mind.



No. No, it was complete shit.



I promised your father
I'd bring you back here.



What the fuck?



He said it was the only
way you'd believe.



Your father was never more
than a camera click away.



That's me.



He was my father.



And I killed him.



To your father, protecting you
was worth giving up his life.



Protect me?



He was trying
to fucking kill me!



No. He wasn't trying
to kill you.



He was trying to rescue you.



When Cross
left the Fraternity,



Sloan hunted you down.



Ever since Fox had her teeth in you, he's
been trying to separate you from them.



Your father never wanted you
in the Fraternity, Wesley.



He wanted a different
path for you,



with things that
he could never have.



A home.



Peace.
No.



He hoped you would
find your own way.



Your father got
hold of this.



Decipher it yourself.



Sloan began manufacturing targets
of his own for profit years ago.



Your father found out
about it.



And he was going to do something
about it on his own, right?



But Sloan turned
everyone against him.



My father's name never
even came up, did it?



No. Holding to the code
made him a target.



Yes.



You want me to run?
No.



I want you to live.



You can have
a different life, Wesley.



Like your father
wanted for you.



We trained him well.



My father
was wrong about one thing.



Everything they told me
wasn't a lie.



They taught me how to kill,
how to feel no pain,



and most importantly, that every
job has a perfect weapon.



Well, I'm the perfect weapon.



And I'm supposed to run?



No, I've been doing that
my entire life.



So I say no.



I say kill them all and let
fate sort out the mess.



Kill him.



He's here!



Pussy.



Pussy, pussy.



Pussy, pussy.



Pussy.



Sloan!



My father wasn't a traitor.



This is a kill order.



And it's got
Sloan's name on it.



What did you say to me?



It's a name. It's a target.



I don't want this person dead.



Fate does.



Fate wanted you dead.



And he couldn't take it.



So he started manufacturing his
own targets for his own gains.



And that's when my dad found out
and decided to stand against him.



And that's when you
sent a man's son



to kill his father.



You're not an assassin
of fate, Sloan.



You're just a thug
who can bend bullets.



Is that true?



Here is what the truth is.



Your name came up.



Your name came up.



Your name came up.



Your name.



Your name.



Yours.



Everyone in this room.



If I had not done
what I did,



you would all be dead.



I saved your lives.



Now look where we are.
We are stronger than ever.



Changing the course
of history as we see it.



Choosing the targets
we select.



We can redistribute power
where we see fit.



The wolves rule.



Not the sheep.



Now, if any of you feel
the need to follow the code



of the Fraternity
to the letter,



I invite you to take your gun,



put it in your mouth
and pull the trigger.



That is what Wesley demands.



Otherwise,



shoot this motherfucker



and let us take our Fraternity
of Assassins to heights



reserved only
for the gods of men.



You choose.



Fuck the code.



Sloan!



Sloan!



Six weeks ago,
I was ordinary and pathetic.



Just like you.



But who am I now?



Account manager?



Assassin?



Or just another tool who was
mind-fucked into killing his father?



I am all of these.



And I am none of these.



Who am I now?



This is not me
fulfilling my destiny.



This is not me following
in my father's footsteps.



This is definitely not me
saving the world.



Still trying to figure
out who you are?



This is not me.



This is just
a motherfucking decoy.



Oh, fuck.



This is me taking control.



From Sloan,



from the Fraternity,



from Janice,
from billing reports,



from ergonomic keyboards,



from cheating girlfriends
and sack-of-shit best friends.



This is me taking back control



of my life.



What the fuck
have you done lately?
