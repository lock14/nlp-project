1
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:54,822
She's a real beauty, huh?
Yep, a real beaut.

2
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:57,982
This car is for you. Now, let me guess.

3
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:00,062
The man of the house
needs a second car

4
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:02,222
so the little lady
can go to the garden club

5
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,942
while he plays gin rummy
with the boys, huh?

6
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:07,862
Actually, we need a car
so we can go rock climbing.

7
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,542
Rock climbing?
Why would anybody go climb a rock?

8
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:11,622
Man, things are changing.

9
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:14,782
I remember when men were men
and women were gals

10
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:16,742
and we'd call coloreds, coloreds.

11
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:18,582
You know, actually,
I think we're gonna get going.

12
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:22,062
Hey, come on, sweetie, don't be a bitch.
Let's talk some numbers here.

13
00:01:22,142 --> 00:01:23,862
Hey, hey, hey,
don't talk to my wife like that.

14
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:28,742
Hey, boy, I fought in the big war.
I mean, nobody tells me what to do.

15
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:30,222
You understand? Hold this.

16
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:35,502
- Oh, my God.
- Audie Murphy, motherfucker.

17
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,255
Resync by Ajoull 
2014-06-11

18
00:01:37,422 --> 00:01:39,582
Somebody get Dick Lewiston off the lot.

19
00:01:39,662 --> 00:01:42,342
What's it matter anyways, Mr. Selleck?
No one's selling anything.

20
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:46,502
- It's a damn killing field out there.
- Mr. Selleck, I think I made a sale.

21
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:49,902
- Terrific. Good job, Teddy.
- And he wants to pay in cash,

22
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:52,622
non-sequential unmarked bills
neatly packed in this canvas bag.

23
00:01:52,702 --> 00:01:54,302
Well, that's a bank bag, Teddy.

24
00:01:56,662 --> 00:02:00,542
My eyes. My eyes. My LASIK.

25
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:02,822
- Shit. Somebody call the cops.
- It burns!

26
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:06,342
- Teddy, go flush your eyes out.
- I feel like a Smurf just jizzed in my face.

27
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:07,942
We got to do something.

28
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:12,062
I've had this lot 27 years,
and it's dying right before my eyes.

29
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:14,662
We either do something drastic,
or we pull the plug.

30
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:18,022
I'm thinking about calling a hotshot,
a weekend warrior.

31
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:21,182
I was thinking about
calling a mercenary.

32
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:22,302
What?

33
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:26,862
- A mercenary?
- Hell, Zooha, I got no choice.

34
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:31,022
The bank's crawling up my ass
for back payments.

35
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,182
If we don't turn this thing around
by August,

36
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:36,822
- this place is gonna be a TCBY.
- But a mercenary?

37
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:38,422
All they do is sell cars and move on.

38
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:40,942
There's no connection
to the community, Ben.

39
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:43,742
Don't do this.
It hasn't gotten that bad, has it?

40
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:47,342
Please, God,
forgive me for what I'm about to do.

41
00:02:57,262 --> 00:03:00,782
- By the way, great sale.
- Hear, hear.

42
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:02,262
Very good.

43
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:05,102
Thank you, darling.

44
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:08,062
I don't know why, but I can't enjoy
breakfast anywhere but a strip club.

45
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:10,382
My mom used to
always cook bacon naked.

46
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:12,902
She would cook bacon all day long.

47
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:18,222
Don "The Goods" Ready. Yes. Yeah.

48
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:23,022
You want some cars sold.
We'll be there.

49
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:27,222
Fourth of July weekend, three-day sale.
We got a dealership in the ICU.

50
00:03:27,302 --> 00:03:30,062
Two hundred and eleven cars
getting suntans on the lot.

51
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:33,062
Guess what, fellas?
We're going to Temecula.

52
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:34,742
Fuck, Don.

53
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:36,782
Honey, we just finished the last job
three hours ago.

54
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:38,142
I still smell like customer.

55
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:40,062
Don, I don't mean to complain,

56
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:43,142
but it's been a year and a half
since I've been home.

57
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,902
And I'm 90% sure
I left my front door open.

58
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:48,182
I don't know, Don.
I think we sit this one out.

59
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,302
You've been pushing us pretty hard
since 'Querque.

60
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:52,742
Forget about 'Querque, all right?

61
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,702
What do we do? We sell cars.

62
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:57,542
What does a tiger do?
Hunts and kills prey.

63
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:59,262
What else are we gonna do in this life?

64
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:03,622
I need every swinging dick in that field.
Babs, come on. Let's do it.

65
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:15,222
All right. We are headed
to Temecula, California.

66
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:16,942
Population 98,000.

67
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:20,902
It's a family business.
Owner, one Benjamin K. Selleck.

68
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,542
Married 30 years to wife, Tammy.

69
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:26,382
One daughter, lvy, age 29,
looks good in beat-up jeans.

70
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:27,942
Yes, she does.

71
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:32,782
One son named Peter, age 10,
loves robot dinosaurs and pizza night.

72
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:35,382
Looks like 10-year-old Peter
got a five o'clock shadow.

73
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:37,422
Yeah, it must be the fax ink.

74
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:41,062
God bless the Hacienda Court,
but their fax service...

75
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:43,582
- What are you doing, honey?
- Enjoying myself.

76
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,862
Sir, there's no smoking on airplanes.

77
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:51,582
I know. It's ridiculous, isn't it?
Don't worry about it, I'll be quick.

78
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:54,702
Sir, if you light that,
I'll have to report you to the FAA.

79
00:04:56,302 --> 00:04:59,542
Stacey, do you know when the first
commercial flight went smokeless?

80
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,662
- No.
- 1973.

81
00:05:01,742 --> 00:05:03,622
And did you know that in 1969,

82
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:05,662
when smoking was allowed
on all flights,

83
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:09,142
- we put a man on the moon?
- I had no idea.

84
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:10,982
Look.

85
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:14,702
You know what that is?

86
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,502
That's a remnant of a better time,
but they welded it shut.

87
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:21,102
And it starts with ashtrays,

88
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:25,422
and it ends with all of our precious
freedoms being stripped away.

89
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:29,262
I remember back in the day
when you got on a plane

90
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:31,622
and you knew
you were in for a good time.

91
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:33,702
- A little smoking, a little drinking.
- Yeah.

92
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,542
And the stewardesses.

93
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:41,222
Stacey, you come from a proud tradition
of blazing hot stewardesses.

94
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:45,022
And now you can't do one damn thing

95
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:48,982
without someone reporting you to
the Department of Homeland Security.

96
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:50,102
- Am I right?
- That's right.

97
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,502
- You listen to Don.
- I had to take my pants off

98
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:54,702
and nibble my Old Spice
down to three ounces

99
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:56,222
just to get on the plane, Stacey.

100
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:57,862
They made me throw out
my mouthwash.

101
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:59,422
I had to give up my bath jellies.

102
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:01,142
They made me breastfeed
some old man.

103
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:04,542
That's what I'm talking about.
But we don't have to take it, Stacey.

104
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:06,622
Like Henry David Thoreau
and Rosa Parks

105
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:08,782
and David Lee Roth
when he left Van Halen,

106
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:11,542
we can say, "Enough. Enough injustice."

107
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,542
And when you and I are old and gray,
we can look back on this

108
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:17,742
and remember when we were
30,000 feet above God's green earth,

109
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:22,262
and we smoked one,
we smoked one for America.

110
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,222
Yeah.

111
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:31,502
You motherfucker.

112
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:33,782
Nice work. Nice work.

113
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:36,462
Who are you?

114
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:40,462
I'm Don Ready, and I got the goods.

115
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,302
This is some killer kush.

116
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:56,102
Nun pops her head out and says,
"Shit. Guess I got to gargle."

117
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:02,542
Poor Don. It's like everything he does
is to make him forget about 'Querque.

118
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,022
Takes a lot of pain to sell cars
the way that man does.

119
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:30,982
- You're here from Selleck Motors?
- No, but my dad is.

120
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:33,982
You're supposed to put the name of the
party you're picking up, not your own.

121
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:35,462
I love the drawing, though.

122
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,142
Yeah, I'm a really good drawer.

123
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:39,102
I like to draw stomach muscles
the most.

124
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:42,662
I can also draw Darth Vader's helmet.
I can also draw him.

125
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:46,542
I can draw a saber,
a lightsaber or a regular sword.

126
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:47,982
It doesn't even matter.

127
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:50,982
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Are you drunk?

128
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:54,902
Are you retarded?
Because we're here to help you.

129
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:59,502
Don't move. Dad, Amber Alert! Adult!

130
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:03,622
Stranger danger! Stranger danger! Dad!

131
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,062
Here, relax, Peter, okay? Take a swig.

132
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:09,302
It looks like it wasn't the fax ink.
He's some sort of man-child.

133
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:11,182
It's a pituitary problem, ma'am.

134
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:14,262
He's 10,
in the developing body of an adult.

135
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:18,662
I'm sorry, buddy. I am totally sorry.
Put it up here. High five.

136
00:08:18,702 --> 00:08:21,262
Good effort there. You must be Ben.
I'm Don Ready.

137
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:23,462
- That's me.
- And this must be lvy.

138
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:27,702
Wow! Can I ask you a quick question?
How much does a polar bear weigh?

139
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:30,262
- No idea.
- Enough to break the ice.

140
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:32,222
- Don Ready. How are you?
- Wow.

141
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:34,422
- Went old-school with you.
- Impressive.

142
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:37,702
I'm Babs.
And, yes, the rug matches the drapes.

143
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:39,782
And this beautiful man is Jibby.

144
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:41,982
- Hi.
- What's up?

145
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:45,262
And who is this guy?
Well, you are a strapping young man.

146
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:49,222
- Brent Gage, sir.
- Brent Gage, now that is a strong name.

147
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:53,022
I don't know why, but right off the bat,
I like you a lot.

148
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:55,782
What's going on?

149
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:57,782
Peter, let's help the crew
with their luggage.

150
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:02,422
Awesome. Hold this, Dad. Transformer.

151
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:05,582
Cute, isn't he?

152
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:07,102
I'd fuck him.

153
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:10,382
Hey, what is wrong with you, lady?
He is a child.

154
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:11,582
We're only gonna be here
for three days,

155
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:12,702
so try not to fall in love with me.

156
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:14,662
I'm sorry, has a girl ever bought that?

157
00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:16,022
I'm just, you know, buckshot approach.

158
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:17,902
I'm just gonna keep firing
till I hit something.

159
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:19,542
That's delightful.

160
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:24,142
So, there was a kid up the street,
Chris Bamberger,

161
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:27,422
had one of those brand-new,
tricked out Krazy Kruisers.

162
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,462
Side brakes,
streamers off the handle grips.

163
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,182
In other words, fully loaded.

164
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:33,222
What am I driving?

165
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:36,422
<i>A fucking Hoppity Hip.</i>

166
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:39,302
<i>Basically a balloon with a handle on it.</i>

167
00:09:39,582 --> 00:09:41,542
<i>It might as well have had</i>
<i>a bumper sticker on the back that said,</i>

168
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,222
<i>"My parents don't work."</i>

169
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:46,982
<i>So I walk up to him, hop up to him.</i>
<i>I introduce myself,</i>

170
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,462
<i>and I say, "You seem like a cool guy."</i>

171
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,262
<i>"Why don't you have a Hoppity Hip?"</i>

172
00:09:51,622 --> 00:09:54,502
You know? I tell him it's faster,
it's cooler.

173
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:58,462
<i>It's got the finger-molded hand grip,</i>
<i>double-enforced bouncing axis.</i>

174
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:02,182
<i>I work this kid like a pro.</i>
<i>Walked him through the brochures.</i>

175
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:04,182
<i>Offered him a bubble gum cigarette.</i>

176
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:06,942
<i>Even threw in some night crawlers</i>
<i>to sweeten the deal.</i>

177
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,702
<i>Bottom line is,</i>
<i>this kid was actually happy</i>

178
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,142
<i>to bounce around on the balloon,</i>

179
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:15,822
<i>while I rode away on his brand-new,</i>
<i>tricked-out chopper.</i>

180
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:19,902
I like to think that was my first sale.

181
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:38,822
Right over there is Selleck Motors.
I thought you might want to take a look.

182
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:45,622
Jesus, Ben,
looks like a refugee camp for dirty men.

183
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:49,222
Looks like the bus station
in <i>Total Recall.</i>

184
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:53,342
We're gonna fix your place up, Ben.

185
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:55,222
We're gonna get you
a Creatable Inflatable,

186
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:57,902
goddamn American flag,
balloons, all that shit.

187
00:10:57,942 --> 00:11:00,182
Plus, we need a radio and TV blitz,

188
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:02,782
and we're gonna need to round up
a celebrity to make a lot appearance.

189
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,302
I know just who to call.

190
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:09,062
Now, let's hit the Hacienda Courts,
or as I like to call it, home.

191
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:30,822
I mean, I paid for it.
It'd be disrespectful not to masturbate.

192
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:37,062
All right, let's keep this anonymous.
Don't look at me. Don't look at me.

193
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:38,502
Don't even... Don't you look at me.

194
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:44,942
Yeah. <i>Dawson's Creek.</i>
James Van Der Beek, my nigger.

195
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:51,902
Okay, Peter,
it's time to go sit in your big chair.

196
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:56,302
Now, everybody dig in. Don't be shy.

197
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,422
I'm sorry, Mrs. Selleck.

198
00:11:57,502 --> 00:12:01,102
I'm one of those rare birds that prefers
takeout over a home-cooked meal.

199
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,582
Well, I got to tell you, Don,
that is flat-out weird and rude.

200
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:07,582
But you do what you need to do.

201
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:12,142
You know, Mr. Don Ready,
our lvy here actually left graduate school

202
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:14,862
to come back and help us out
with little Peter.

203
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,622
- Wow.
- That's the kind of girl she is.

204
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,022
You can take the girl
out of Temecula, but...

205
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,102
Hey, Brent.

206
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:21,182
...you can't take Temecula
out of the girl.

207
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,662
You see my wife over there?

208
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:24,862
Yeah.

209
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:27,662
It is a dead marriage.

210
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:31,422
But, you know, you learn to live with it.

211
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:36,782
You drive around, out at night,
windows down, music up.

212
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:40,182
Some people call it cruising.

213
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:43,782
Me, I call it looking for a friend.

214
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:46,862
- Are you my friend, Brent?
- No.

215
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:49,622
So tomorrow morning, our troops
will rendezvous with your troops

216
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,862
at 0700, and then
I'll hit the floor for my intro speech,

217
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:56,222
like a mountain lion
pouncing on an unsuspecting jogger.

218
00:12:56,302 --> 00:12:58,742
Make sure your underwear
is tight tomorrow,

219
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:00,022
because you will have a boner.

220
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,222
Amen.

221
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:07,022
I like the sound of that. Right, Brent?

222
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:09,782
By Tuesday, my friend,
you are back in the black.

223
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:11,342
Well, hear, hear.

224
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:13,262
Okay, Mr. Ready,

225
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:16,942
this business has been in our family
for 40 years, so no sleazy stuff, okay?

226
00:13:16,982 --> 00:13:17,942
Don't worry about it, darling.

227
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:20,342
We're not gonna break the rules.
We're just gonna bend them a little bit.

228
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:23,262
Okay, okay. I just... I know your type.

229
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:26,182
You know, it's all the thrill of the hunt.
I get it.

230
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:29,222
I mean, you crave it. You corner it.

231
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:31,542
But, Mr. Ready,
let me ask you a question.

232
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:33,342
Do you know what to do
when you catch it?

233
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:40,902
- Are we talking about pussy?
- Oh, my stars. You didn't.

234
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:43,062
- That's what she was saying.
- Oh, my goodness!

235
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:45,342
I'm sorry, I apologize.
I'm a Christian man,

236
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:47,822
or whatever religion dominates
the region that I'm selling in,

237
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:48,982
but you have to admit, it did sound like

238
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,342
she was talking about
the big vajayjay, right?

239
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:52,382
- Didn't it?
- Amen.

240
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,142
I guess it kind of did. Yeah.

241
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:57,622
Hey, come on, man.

242
00:13:57,702 --> 00:14:00,782
Jibby was a pro bowler
for two years on the tour.

243
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:02,102
Got a lot of great stories.

244
00:14:02,182 --> 00:14:05,422
Well, what can I say?
It was the go-go '80s,

245
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:10,702
the height of professional bowling,
girls, limos, wristbands.

246
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:13,542
Ivy, I think you got the wrong impression
of me earlier.

247
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:16,502
I'm a really sensitive person, all right?

248
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:19,422
For instance, I'm not a texter.
I'd rather hear your voice, you know.

249
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:23,062
- Hey, everybody, I'm lvy's fiancé.
- Look who's here.

250
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:25,702
Paxton, such a weird thing to say
when you enter a room.

251
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:28,302
Well, I'm just letting everybody
know the deal.

252
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:31,942
Well, I am Paxton Harding
of Harding lmports.

253
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:36,742
And you must be the guys who are
going to save Ben Selleck Motors.

254
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:40,262
- Yeah. That's the idea.
- I didn't catch your name, friend.

255
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:43,942
That's because
I didn't give it to you, friend.

256
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:47,822
Well, a couple of friends ought to know
each other's names, right?

257
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:50,422
- My name's Don Ready.
- All right.

258
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:53,862
I guess I won that little exchange.
You fell for it.

259
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:56,502
In fact, let me be the first
to tell you guys, good luck.

260
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:59,302
Everyone at Harding lmports
and every dealership in this town

261
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:00,382
is rooting for you guys.

262
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:03,782
You got a Harding guarantee on that.
I swear to God.

263
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:06,182
I'm off to rehearsal.

264
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:08,822
All right? I want to give my two ladies
a kiss on the cheek.

265
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:11,422
You are so sweet.

266
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:15,462
You know, Paxton here is in one
of those popular bands in Temecula,

267
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:16,582
Balls Out.

268
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:18,302
- No, Big Ups.
- Big Ups. Sorry.

269
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:19,822
Either way.

270
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:24,342
Big Ups is the name of the band.
It's me and Ricky and Jason, and we...

271
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:26,742
You know, we sing about life
and love and passion,

272
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:30,862
and I'm not gonna lie to you,
we have some pretty sick dance moves.

273
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,342
Are you in a boy band?

274
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:35,662
No, I'm in a man band.
We're all over 30, we call it a man band.

275
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,182
You're men in a boy band.

276
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:40,342
We opened for O-Town,
right here in Temecula, okay?

277
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,022
- Google it.
- No.

278
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:43,822
- Google it.
- No.

279
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:45,742
Why wouldn't you google it?
I just told you to google it.

280
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:47,662
- Google "Big Ups."
- You know, I googled it.

281
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:49,622
It said you fucking blow.

282
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,742
That was O-Town's website.

283
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:55,302
You know what? I'm rising above this.

284
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:59,422
While you guys are yukking it up,
I'm gonna go rehearse with Big Ups.

285
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:01,782
Ricky and Jason are in the car. Let's go.

286
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:03,822
- All right, bye-bye.
- See you all tomorrow.

287
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:05,382
Man, that dude is garbage.

288
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,542
What a jerk.

289
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:09,462
Who wants a big hunk of this meat?

290
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:16,102
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

291
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:18,182
<i>A couple guys came in here earlier</i>
<i>looking for Vanessa,</i>

292
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:21,342
<i>and I got a little bit of bad news for you,</i>
<i>Vanessa is dead.</i>

293
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:22,502
<i>Here's Radio Moscow.</i>

294
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,662
It's funny, I haven't been in Temecula in,
what, 23 years.

295
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:27,102
Last time I was here,

296
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:30,222
I spent two straight days
in a Hacienda Courts

297
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:32,782
with the third runner-up
to Miss Temecula.

298
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,102
Never saw her again.

299
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:36,182
Hey, what do you make
of this Selleck guy?

300
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,702
I got to be honest with you,

301
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:40,182
have you noticed him saying
overtly sexual things to me?

302
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:42,462
- Touching me?
- I haven't.

303
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,582
That is disgusting.

304
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,862
But don't get me wrong,
I have an erection.

305
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:49,542
Babs?

306
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:54,302
Can I tell you a deep, dark secret
I ain't never told anyone before?

307
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:57,462
Baby, I really would rather you not.
I'm tired.

308
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,182
I'm 42 years old,

309
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:04,422
and I ain't never, ever
made love to a woman.

310
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:06,902
- You're a virgin?
- Hell, no.

311
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:09,622
No, I've been with hundreds of women,
maybe thousands.

312
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:12,942
I just ain't never really ever made love
to a woman.

313
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:16,302
You know, I've done three ways,
four ways,

314
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:19,502
<i>ménage à trois, ménage cinq, six.</i>

315
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:24,222
I've 69ed, 89ed, 114ed.

316
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:28,102
Golden, diamond and platinum showers.
I like that.

317
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:30,822
I mean, I've ripped shit up.

318
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,422
Done all that.

319
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:38,382
But I ain't never, ever made love
to a woman.

320
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:40,022
You will, Jibby.

321
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:43,662
As long as we're being honest,

322
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:46,382
I've something I want to share with you.

323
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:49,102
I think I want to make love
to a 10-year-old boy.

324
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:50,342
What?

325
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:52,262
But he's in the body
of a 30-year-old man,

326
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:53,902
so who's to blame?

327
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:55,822
- You the adult.
- Right.

328
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:58,582
You'd be the one to blame.

329
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,382
Hey, Babs. Hey, Jibby.

330
00:18:02,462 --> 00:18:04,782
Hey, Don,
there are three hot dancers over there.

331
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:06,342
I think they might be good for the sale.

332
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:08,782
Yeah, sign them up. Good energy,
make the customers happy.

333
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:11,662
<i>Hey, guys,</i>
<i>get those food orders in quickly,</i>

334
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:15,062
<i>'cause in 25 minutes the kitchen</i>
<i>is rented out for a porno shoot.</i>

335
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:18,902
- <i>Are you disgusted? I am.</i>
- Book the DJ.

336
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:22,462
You sure, Don?
I just thought after 'Querque...

337
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:25,142
Hey. 'Querque was 'Querque.
This is this.

338
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:28,022
It's time for all of us to move on,
all right?

339
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:29,942
And it starts with booking that DJ.

340
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:39,662
Where is he? I even wore my tight
underwear for the boner speech.

341
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,902
Just relax, honey. He's getting ready.

342
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,622
As for the underwear,
I think it was just an expression.

343
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:45,662
Look, I may be old-fashioned,

344
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:47,062
but the man says,
"Wear your boner pants,"

345
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:48,582
I wear my boner pants.

346
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:53,902
You can do this. You are a winner.
Don Ready has the heart of a champion.

347
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:57,462
I'm a fucking stallion. I should be owned
by a goddamn Middle Eastern sheikh.

348
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,902
There's almost no doubt
you invented the phrase, "It's all good."

349
00:19:00,982 --> 00:19:04,502
In the schoolyard, a Don Ready
is a euphemism for a hard-on.

350
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:07,222
All right, fellas,
everybody gather around.

351
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:11,142
Now, you all know the deal.
Over the next few days,

352
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:14,222
Don Ready and his team
will be overseeing sales.

353
00:19:14,302 --> 00:19:17,022
Basically, they will be your boss
for the weekend.

354
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:20,822
Now, I trust them. And if you trust them,
together we will sell cars.

355
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,862
You were the first person to wear
a Von Dutch trucker hat.

356
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:26,982
- I really regret that.
- As well you should.

357
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:29,582
Look at my husband.
Looks like he's got a Don Ready.

358
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:31,342
Give me a minute.

359
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:41,302
I'm Babs Merrick.
I'm gonna tell you people a little story.

360
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:45,462
A story about a girl who grew up
in the worst part of the South Bronx.

361
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:49,262
Well, one day, this little girl fell in love
with a boxer named Winston.

362
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:53,222
But their love was too good to last,

363
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:56,542
and one day,
the Vice Lords came a-calling,

364
00:19:56,622 --> 00:20:00,422
saying, "Winston,
it's time to take a dive."

365
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:03,942
Coroner found two bullets in his heart.

366
00:20:04,022 --> 00:20:06,902
One of them
was meant for this little girl.

367
00:20:06,982 --> 00:20:11,342
<i>It's a hard world, mama</i>
<i>You got to push on through</i>

368
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:12,902
<i>'Cause life in the ghetto</i>

369
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:16,662
Well, everyone told this little girl
to shut her mouth and go away.

370
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:18,542
But she didn't do that.

371
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:21,862
She made sure every single one
of those pieces of human trash

372
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:22,982
looked her straight in the eye

373
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:26,222
before she pulled the trigger
on that platinum.357 Magnum.

374
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:27,742
Jose!

375
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:29,982
Ramon!

376
00:20:31,662 --> 00:20:33,942
<i>It ain't easy</i>

377
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:36,382
I got to tell you people, on TV,

378
00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:40,942
they don't show the dead man
when the poop leaves the butt.

379
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:43,662
Make no mistake, gentlemen,

380
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:49,342
when you die, poop leaves your butt.

381
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:53,462
Man. That is a dark story.

382
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:57,102
I know. I made it up.
Have a great sale, everybody.

383
00:20:57,182 --> 00:20:58,382
- What?
- Great sale.

384
00:20:58,462 --> 00:20:59,422
<i>It ain't easy</i>

385
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:01,782
- She made it up?
- It ain't easy.

386
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:03,622
I'm Brent Gage.

387
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:07,622
They call me The Magician.
I am a wizard with numbers.

388
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:12,782
I have never, never lost a sale
to bad credit.

389
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:15,182
Quick story. A couple years ago,
MC Hammer, remember him?

390
00:21:15,222 --> 00:21:17,782
He was in bankruptcy,
living on the street,

391
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:20,342
sleeping in the left leg
of his Hammer pants.

392
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:22,022
The next day,

393
00:21:22,102 --> 00:21:25,262
I financed that man a car,
no questions asked.

394
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:29,182
Hammer lived in that car
for the next year and a half.

395
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:31,062
So you guys are just taking over?

396
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:34,462
With your cool nicknames
and your confidence?

397
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:35,822
I mean, how are we supposed to feel?

398
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:38,182
Yeah, what about our sales?
Our commissions?

399
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:39,422
It's all good.

400
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:42,782
I'm Don "The Goods" Ready.

401
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:45,382
Everyone here told you their story.
Here's mine.

402
00:21:45,462 --> 00:21:49,142
I have hair on my balls and I sell cars.
The end.

403
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:54,422
All right. Today, tomorrow, Monday.

404
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:59,022
It's July 4th weekend, everybody,
and we're going to war, all right?

405
00:21:59,382 --> 00:22:01,502
When you guys are deep in the shit,

406
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:04,982
I want you to think about the real heroes
of this Independence Day.

407
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:09,502
The Revolutionary War soldier
who had his gangrene foot sawed off,

408
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:12,302
with nothing to numb the pain
except a shot of whiskey

409
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:15,862
and that guy with the weird headband
playing the flute.

410
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:19,582
What about Private Jones, huh?
Seventeen-year-old soldier.

411
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:24,942
Got his guts shot out
in a 'Nam rice paddy. All right?

412
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:26,542
Dick here knows what I'm talking about.

413
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:29,742
He's talking about freedom,
you fucking queers!

414
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:34,942
Don't even get me started
on Pearl Harbor.

415
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:38,102
Our Navy boys out there
enjoying the bright Hawaiian sun,

416
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:42,822
when all of a sudden, here comes
the Japs flying in low and fast.

417
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:47,142
This dealership is our battlefield.
Don't give up the fight.

418
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:51,142
We are the Americans,
and they are the enemy. Never again.

419
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:53,262
Never again.

420
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:55,582
Never again!

421
00:22:55,662 --> 00:23:00,262
- Never again! Never again! Never again!
- Never again! Never again! Never again!

422
00:23:00,302 --> 00:23:01,902
Let's get him!

423
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:05,542
Eat my shit!

424
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:11,022
- Dad, don't you think you should step in?
- No, he can take it. He's squirrelly.

425
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:13,542
Stop! All right, stop!

426
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:15,982
Everyone, calm down!
Put him down, Jibby.

427
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:21,142
Okay, we have all just participated
in a hate crime.

428
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:23,982
Was it a hate crime
or a freedom crime?

429
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:26,582
All right, everyone, just calm down.
Bottom line,

430
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:28,662
we have all just committed
a federal offense.

431
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:32,182
Which means that G-men
are gonna be crawling all over this lot.

432
00:23:32,782 --> 00:23:34,902
Let's get our story straight.

433
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:38,942
Dang came at us with a samurai sword,

434
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:41,702
fire extinguisher,
and Chinese throwing stars.

435
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:44,022
- Yeah.
- That seems plausible.

436
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:45,662
No, I did not. No, I did not. I...

437
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:48,422
We got to get a sword
and get his prints on it.

438
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:50,342
There was no weaponry of any kind!

439
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:53,822
Okay, Dang, how about this?
You get first dibs on customer ups.

440
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:58,182
In return, you agree to forget all about
being the victim of a hate crime.

441
00:24:00,142 --> 00:24:01,142
Okay.

442
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:05,742
- That's it, Dang. That's the guy we love.
- Thank you, Mr. Selleck. I'm really sorry.

443
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:07,982
I'm not even Japanese. I'm Korean.

444
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:10,182
Korean? Why didn't you say so?

445
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:13,862
On that note, let's man those
battle stations, everybody, all right?

446
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:14,982
Never again.

447
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:17,582
We got one hour.
Let's get this place in shape.

448
00:24:29,262 --> 00:24:32,862
Really simple, boys. If you take this six,
you flip it, that's the price.

449
00:24:32,942 --> 00:24:34,662
You know what you can do with this?

450
00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:37,702
You can take this
and turn it into that if you want.

451
00:24:37,782 --> 00:24:42,222
You've taken $3,000 off this car.
It's back down to your original price.

452
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:46,822
- Zooha, to sell you must...
- Confine, confuse, conflict.

453
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:50,022
Nice! Teddy Dang, to close, you must...

454
00:24:50,062 --> 00:24:52,742
Lie, loan, leave.

455
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,462
Nice. Mr. Dick Lewiston?

456
00:24:56,302 --> 00:24:59,382
Go fuck yourself,
you bald-headed son of a bitch.

457
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:03,022
- I've seen more hair on bacon.
- Good enough.

458
00:25:03,742 --> 00:25:05,422
Wow, you must be the girls
from the strip club.

459
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,222
- Yes. Heather.
- Hey, Heather. How are you?

460
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:09,702
Your job is to greet people,
get them in the buying mood, okay?

461
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:10,782
- I have an idea.
- Sure.

462
00:25:10,862 --> 00:25:13,502
Since it's July 4th, I thought it'd be good
to talk to the customers

463
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:16,582
about how this government
has been cutting benefits for veterans.

464
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:20,462
Let me guess, you are dancing to pay
for your Masters in Political Science.

465
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:22,502
- Yes. How did you know?
- I don't know.

466
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:23,862
Stripper stories,
they usually come in three,

467
00:25:23,942 --> 00:25:25,742
college student, single mom, cokehead.

468
00:25:26,182 --> 00:25:27,302
What's your son's name?

469
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:29,262
I'm kidding.
I don't even know what I'm saying.

470
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:31,502
I'm bananas.
You guys are doing an amazing job.

471
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:34,342
Sapphire, wipe your nose. God.

472
00:25:34,422 --> 00:25:37,702
<i>All right, we gonna be selling</i>
<i>some cars today.</i>

473
00:25:38,782 --> 00:25:41,582
<i>And tomorrow,</i>
<i>you know who we got coming in? I do.</i>

474
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:46,742
American Idol's <i>very own</i>
<i>Bo Bice's brother is coming down.</i>

475
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:49,622
<i>Yes. Eric Bice will be right here,</i>
<i>rocking the stage.</i>

476
00:25:49,702 --> 00:25:52,302
Hey, DJ. This place is about to pop.

477
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:54,342
Why don't you throw on
some Charlie Daniels?

478
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:55,382
Good call.

479
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:05,302
Nobody tells DJ Request what to play.

480
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:07,782
Let them tell you what to play,
they lose respect for you.

481
00:26:07,822 --> 00:26:10,942
They lose respect for you,
you lose control.

482
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:12,422
Not today.

483
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:15,982
All right.

484
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:19,022
- You want to thumb wrestle?
- Yeah, I'm awesome.

485
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:22,742
- You won.
- I totally beat you.

486
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:25,262
- What are you gonna do to me now?
- What?

487
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:29,862
- You better spank me or something.
- Babs! He's 10.

488
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:31,942
Ten and a half.

489
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:33,622
Do you hear that, Ready?
Ten and a half.

490
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,382
Brent. Those are my kids.

491
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:41,862
Yeah. And probably a good reason
you're not selling.

492
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:42,902
What are you talking about?

493
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:45,702
Zooha, let's face it.
You've got husky kids.

494
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:47,182
I know it, you know it,

495
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:49,662
and every Chuck E. Cheese
in a 50-mile radius knows it.

496
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:52,622
You know who doesn't need to know it?
The customer.

497
00:26:52,702 --> 00:26:53,862
I don't understand.

498
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:56,382
Look, you put up a picture of skinny kids.

499
00:26:56,462 --> 00:26:59,182
Customer thinks, "Oh, my lord,
this guy needs the commission.

500
00:26:59,262 --> 00:27:01,622
"He's got to feed those hungry mouths."

501
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:03,502
Okay. I get it. I get it.

502
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:04,942
Should I take down the picture
of my wife?

503
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:06,902
No, that's your closer.

504
00:27:06,982 --> 00:27:11,742
Fat kids, customer hates you.
Fat wife, customer pities you.

505
00:27:12,142 --> 00:27:15,862
Shit, Zooha. That's the best fat wife
I've seen in four or five years.

506
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:17,262
Can I have a copy of it?

507
00:27:19,502 --> 00:27:21,422
Nice balloons.

508
00:27:21,502 --> 00:27:23,702
Wow, that line must have
knocked them dead in the frat house.

509
00:27:23,782 --> 00:27:25,622
Come on,
I'm just trying to have some fun.

510
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:27,302
So, you pumped for the big day?

511
00:27:27,382 --> 00:27:28,422
Yeah, it should be great.

512
00:27:28,502 --> 00:27:31,182
They say you sell some cars.
Let's see you sell some cars.

513
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:34,142
No, no, I'm not talking about the sale.
I'm talking about your wedding.

514
00:27:34,222 --> 00:27:37,542
Excited to spend the next 60 years
of your life with...

515
00:27:39,502 --> 00:27:40,582
- Paxton?
- Paxton.

516
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:44,102
BMW boy band Paxton.
Seems like a super guy.

517
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:45,742
Now, now.

518
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:48,102
All right, what about you?

519
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:51,382
You have any relationships
that last longer than a lap dance?

520
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,182
Have you seen what these girls
do these days?

521
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:56,102
I mean, we are living in the golden age
of lap dances.

522
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,342
- Wow, that has got to be tiring.
- No.

523
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:00,542
You don't want a home life?

524
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:02,662
You don't want to live for somebody
other than yourself?

525
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:06,462
No time.
I'm on the road 51.5 weeks a year,

526
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:10,902
and I like myself a lot. I'm having a blast.

527
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:15,462
You know what? I don't believe you.

528
00:28:30,582 --> 00:28:35,182
Look at them.
They're like crazy boat people. I love it.

529
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:43,622
Give away free hot dogs
and put up an inflatable gorilla,

530
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:45,182
shit's gonna go down.

531
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:49,902
I feel exactly like I did before I landed
on lwo Jima, I swear to God.

532
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,942
There's no difference at all.

533
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:58,502
Attaboy, Teddy.
Pain is weakness leaving the body.

534
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:04,782
Sell these bastard cars! Sell the metal.

535
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,262
Sell the metal. Sell the metal.

536
00:29:08,342 --> 00:29:11,062
Sell the metal. Sell the metal.

537
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:21,862
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

538
00:29:31,022 --> 00:29:34,182
Welcome to Selleck Motors.
Let's get you in a car.

539
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:36,262
- Hi.
- Hi.

540
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:38,542
- Hi. Welcome to Selleck Motors.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,102
Welcome to Selleck Motors.

542
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:50,222
Thanks so much.

543
00:29:57,222 --> 00:29:59,622
What's wrong with her?
What's her name?

544
00:29:59,662 --> 00:30:00,702
Stephanie.

545
00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:03,862
Hey, little Stephanie.

546
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:09,542
You're amazing.
What did you say to her?

547
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:10,622
Shut the fuck up.

548
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:12,862
Why don't we get you into
one of these minivans?

549
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:14,942
Zooha!

550
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:24,062
- You feel it?
- Yeah.

551
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:26,662
I call it the divine rush.

552
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,862
Money for cars. Salesmen
putting themselves on the line.

553
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:32,902
Capitalism, it's my high.

554
00:30:33,422 --> 00:30:36,622
I haven't seen the lot like this
since I brought in the Bandit Car.

555
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,782
You know, rumor is that
that car is one of the cars

556
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:40,582
that was in <i>Smokey and the Bandit.</i>

557
00:30:40,622 --> 00:30:42,782
That weekend this place was hopping.

558
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:44,622
I was thinking we should get that
out of here, you know.

559
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:45,702
It's bad for business.

560
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:50,302
No, that car is a collector's car. That's
worth $200,000, won't take a cent less.

561
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:55,022
But in this <i>Auto Lister,</i> they have
the same exact car for $1,000 less.

562
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:58,062
Wow. What a great deal.

563
00:30:58,102 --> 00:30:59,822
- Excuse me, can I see that?
- Sure.

564
00:31:00,782 --> 00:31:02,262
My, my.

565
00:31:02,342 --> 00:31:04,502
If you can get this car for 1,000 less,

566
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:06,102
you should definitely buy.

567
00:31:06,182 --> 00:31:07,582
In fact, let me call.

568
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,062
Thank you.

569
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:13,062
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

570
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:15,142
<i>Hello?</i>

571
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:18,062
Hi, I'm calling about the car
you have advertised.

572
00:31:18,102 --> 00:31:19,902
<i>Can we get a drink?</i>

573
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:23,222
- No, I don't want to go for a drink.
- <i>Yeah, I can put you in my truck.</i>

574
00:31:23,302 --> 00:31:25,782
<i>We can drive around.</i>
<i>You can see how it handles.</i>

575
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:28,102
- Maybe go to the reservoir.
- Excuse me? I...

576
00:31:28,142 --> 00:31:30,702
- Put the lotion in the basket.
- Who...

577
00:31:30,782 --> 00:31:33,902
- <i>Put the lotion in the fucking basket.</i>
- Oh, my God.

578
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:36,102
See, I try to tell women all the time.

579
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:39,062
<i>Auto Lister's</i> like MySpace
for serial killers.

580
00:31:39,142 --> 00:31:42,622
I don't want to see another one of these
on this lot.

581
00:31:44,622 --> 00:31:47,622
I think I'll just take this car
right over here.

582
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:52,342
Okay, here's the deal, Gary.
I know the stereotype.

583
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:55,982
I'm a woman, got a luscious body,
provocative clothes.

584
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:57,542
I'm gonna use sex to sell cars.

585
00:31:57,622 --> 00:31:59,982
You know what's gonna sell this car?
Price, nothing else.

586
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:01,742
I mean, I like men.

587
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:03,662
I like men a lot.

588
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:08,262
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Do you know what I love?

589
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,862
I love women.

590
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,022
Yeah?

591
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,422
I mean, I'm talking me, an Asian chick,
and a schoolteacher in a shower.

592
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:21,062
- Yeah.
- Get all soapy together and so wet.

593
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:24,782
And you know what?
Maybe like a construction lady comes in,

594
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,702
like, you know,
like I can't even tell if she's hot or not.

595
00:32:26,782 --> 00:32:28,262
- Okay.
- But then she says,

596
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:30,062
"Looks like I could do some work here."

597
00:32:30,142 --> 00:32:32,742
- And she takes off her hat.
- It falls down. Sure.

598
00:32:32,782 --> 00:32:35,222
And then you guys come over
and all three of you undress her.

599
00:32:35,302 --> 00:32:36,502
- Yeah. Hey, hey, guess what?
- Yeah.

600
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:37,742
- What? No.
- I'm next door.

601
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:38,982
Yeah, 'cause I'm the superintendent,

602
00:32:39,062 --> 00:32:41,782
and I'm working on like paperwork,
like doing people's checks, I'm like...

603
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:42,982
Yeah.

604
00:32:43,342 --> 00:32:44,302
- "What is that noise?"
- Like, "That's weird.

605
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:45,502
"There's not supposed to be anybody
next door."

606
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:48,142
"Hey, who's in there?"
And I just hear, "Oh, oh."

607
00:32:48,222 --> 00:32:50,662
I listen by the door for a while,
then I open it up, I'm like, "Hello?"

608
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:54,182
- I still can't see the steam.
- Like, "I'm so scared. Who is it?

609
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:55,262
"Who is that man?"

610
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:56,342
"Hey, you're not supposed
to be in here."

611
00:32:56,422 --> 00:32:58,102
- Can I give you something to say?
- Yeah.

612
00:32:58,182 --> 00:32:59,142
Say this, say, say,

613
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:01,902
"Hey, I knew something was missing
in this apartment,

614
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:03,382
"a big cock."

615
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:06,622
"I knew something was missing
in this apartment, a big cock."

616
00:33:06,702 --> 00:33:08,342
And we're fucking, and then
someone else goes, "Oh, yeah..."

617
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:10,902
- Fuck. I just thought of something, man.
- What?

618
00:33:10,982 --> 00:33:12,822
How the fuck are you gonna get there?

619
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:14,502
I'm right next door, remember?
I'm just gonna walk over.

620
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,342
No, man, this is miles and miles away,
man. You got to get there soon!

621
00:33:17,422 --> 00:33:18,502
I'm, like, managing
a bunch of properties?

622
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:19,782
Yes!

623
00:33:19,822 --> 00:33:21,942
How are you... It's across town.
How are you gonna get there?

624
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:23,622
I don't know. I don't have a car.
I gotta get a bus...

625
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,822
No, man,
you got to fucking take this car.

626
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:29,022
Yes. I am gonna buy this car.
It's a good car, right?

627
00:33:29,102 --> 00:33:30,822
- No.
- I don't give a shit. I'll fucking push...

628
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:32,022
Go see the dudes in the back!

629
00:33:32,102 --> 00:33:34,182
- Run, man! Run!
- I'm gonna go buy this car.

630
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:37,182
In your country,
they would cut your hands off

631
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:39,142
because you're stealing from us.

632
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:41,542
You guys have got an amazing deal,
I can't believe it.

633
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:44,222
Mom! Mom!

634
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:02,742
- How we doing?
- Kicking ass.

635
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:05,342
I was worried earlier,
but we're gonna have a great day.

636
00:34:05,422 --> 00:34:08,342
- Check out that Blake kid. He's on fire.
- Yeah, I noticed.

637
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:09,702
Wasn't that your move?

638
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:13,422
Well, mine ended
with the two-gun salute to heaven,

639
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:15,102
but it's damn close.

640
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:18,382
You remember when I told you
that I partied with that beauty queen

641
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:20,622
23 years ago in Temecula?

642
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,942
I didn't put a hat on my jimmy.

643
00:34:23,902 --> 00:34:27,222
Jesus, Don. You don't think
Blake's your son, do you?

644
00:34:32,782 --> 00:34:34,222
I'll tell you what,
why don't you guys go to finance

645
00:34:34,302 --> 00:34:36,742
- and I'll meet you there, all right?
- Okay.

646
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:39,862
That's impressive, Blake.
You're a natural.

647
00:34:39,942 --> 00:34:41,662
Spend a lot of time
growing up around dealerships?

648
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:44,742
No, but my mom always said
that I had it in my blood.

649
00:34:44,822 --> 00:34:46,142
I remember this one time as a kid,

650
00:34:46,222 --> 00:34:48,222
I traded my crappy Huffy bike to this kid
down the block

651
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:50,022
for his brand-new shiny Schwinn.

652
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:52,022
- No shit.
- No shit, Don.

653
00:34:52,302 --> 00:34:55,782
Hey, was your old man around a lot
when you were growing up?

654
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:58,422
No. He took off before I was born.

655
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:00,422
I'm gonna go back to the sale, Don.

656
00:35:00,502 --> 00:35:03,462
- Blake, how old are you?
- Twenty-two.

657
00:35:05,742 --> 00:35:07,302
Hey, kid. Don.

658
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:09,782
Remember that guy
that wanted the Explorer?

659
00:35:09,862 --> 00:35:11,302
Here's what I got him to do.

660
00:35:11,382 --> 00:35:13,942
Buy his own house from himself for $1,

661
00:35:14,022 --> 00:35:15,742
which means nothing, but to the bank...

662
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:27,902
Don.

663
00:35:27,982 --> 00:35:30,022
- Hey.
- What's going on?

664
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:31,742
Good job.

665
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:35,262
What'd I do, Don?

666
00:35:37,462 --> 00:35:39,622
Fuck you, I don't need your validation.

667
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,382
Look at that number.
Seventy-one cars sold.

668
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:51,062
I am looking at some
real salesmen out here. Good work.

669
00:35:51,142 --> 00:35:54,022
Yeah, we've actually sold 34%
of the inventory.

670
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:55,622
Wow! I'm proud of you.

671
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:59,342
And, by the way, congrats,
whoever pulled off a Nigerian buyback,

672
00:35:59,462 --> 00:36:00,582
haven't seen that in years.

673
00:36:00,622 --> 00:36:04,702
- That was me. You can suck it.
- What's a Nigerian buyback?

674
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:08,502
Guy takes a customer's trade-in,
then 20 minutes later,

675
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:12,302
sells it right back to said customer
at a mark-up.

676
00:36:12,942 --> 00:36:14,942
And we're looking at
an even better day tomorrow.

677
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:18,222
Bo Bice's brother coming in here
to sing some tunes.

678
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:19,662
Shut up. Eric Bice?

679
00:36:19,702 --> 00:36:22,982
The very same.
So, I think we do a little celebrating.

680
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:26,502
And after a hot first day,
there's only one way to do it. 'Okie.

681
00:36:27,022 --> 00:36:28,462
- What?
- What's 'okie?

682
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:29,502
Tell them about it, Dick.

683
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:32,702
He's talking about karaoke,
you fucking queers.

684
00:36:32,782 --> 00:36:34,742
God damn,
Dick knows what I'm talking about.

685
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:38,182
- Let's go. Let's get into it.
- Nice job, everybody.

686
00:36:40,102 --> 00:36:42,302
I've been watching you out there, girl.

687
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:45,542
Your moves are probably responsible
for 10 sales.

688
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:49,302
Well, any individual who pursues
his or her own self interest

689
00:36:49,382 --> 00:36:52,702
actually promotes
the interest of society as a whole.

690
00:36:53,262 --> 00:36:56,462
It's all trade, baby.
That's what makes the world go 'round.

691
00:36:57,262 --> 00:37:01,062
That's funny. I always thought
love made the world go 'round.

692
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,462
See you.

693
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,222
Love.

694
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:12,822
Boy, you should be proud.

695
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:16,222
You took a rag-tag bunch of losers and
turned them into first-rate salesmen.

696
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:18,102
That's what I do, Ben.

697
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,902
- Hello, Ben.
- Hello, Stu.

698
00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:31,182
Looks like you guys had a heck of a day.

699
00:37:31,222 --> 00:37:35,062
Hey, Paxton, Lance Bass called.
He said he... Fucking forget it.

700
00:37:35,142 --> 00:37:36,822
Yeah, like he would have your number.

701
00:37:36,902 --> 00:37:39,342
Hey, Lance Bass never opened
for O-Town.

702
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,582
My boy did. You can google it.

703
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:45,302
Yeah, I told them that already, Dad.
They refused to google it.

704
00:37:45,382 --> 00:37:47,822
Well, let me cut to the chase
for you here, Ben.

705
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:51,182
My boy Paxton's band, Big Ups,
they're really starting to click,

706
00:37:51,222 --> 00:37:53,702
and we're running out of rehearsal
space over at Harding lmports.

707
00:37:53,782 --> 00:37:55,142
So Paxton had a good idea.

708
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:57,582
He said why not make an offer
on your lot,

709
00:37:57,662 --> 00:37:59,982
nice price, before the bank gets it?

710
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:02,222
That way,
Paxton's out front selling Beemers,

711
00:38:02,302 --> 00:38:04,982
then he runs around the back,
makes gold records. What do you think?

712
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:07,302
I don't know, Stu.
We had a pretty good day here.

713
00:38:07,342 --> 00:38:10,222
We had an outstanding day.
Don't be all humble, Ben. Come on.

714
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:11,742
All right, hold it, Don.

715
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,502
Give us a couple minutes alone,
will you?

716
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,662
- You got it, Ben.
- You too, Paxton.

717
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,622
Hey, you know, even if Ben doesn't sell,

718
00:38:18,702 --> 00:38:21,582
we're gonna get this place for pennies
on the dollar when he goes B-rupt.

719
00:38:21,662 --> 00:38:25,062
Really? You're gonna screw over
your future father-in-law?

720
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,382
It's called business, Don. Okay?

721
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:31,182
And besides, I would do anything
to take Big Ups worldwide.

722
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:33,742
So, lvy isn't enough for you?

723
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:41,222
You have a crush on my fiancée.
That is rich!

724
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,182
Here's the deal, old-timer. Get over it.

725
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:46,062
Here is why
I'm not threatened by that at all.

726
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:48,382
- A, I have a beautiful car.
- Yeah.

727
00:38:48,462 --> 00:38:51,622
- B, I have a $44 haircut.
- Right.

728
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:55,462
Yeah, and C, I have slick threads. Yeah.

729
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,782
- Men's Wearhouse. I like the way I look.
- Right.

730
00:38:57,862 --> 00:39:00,422
I'm Temecula's newest hard-on, dog.

731
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:02,862
A, it looks like you just snapped into
a Slim Jim.

732
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:04,102
B, your suit looks like it was...

733
00:39:04,182 --> 00:39:07,342
- I'm glad we could work all this out, Ben.
- Work what out?

734
00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:10,702
Well, Don, it's time I start thinking
about my future grandkids.

735
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,262
I sold the lot to Stu.

736
00:39:12,342 --> 00:39:15,142
He made me a real good offer.
Thank you for your support,

737
00:39:15,182 --> 00:39:17,942
and you'll be paid
for the whole four days.

738
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,102
But we're pulling the plug.

739
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:22,302
Can we get all of their stuff
out of here, pronto?

740
00:39:22,382 --> 00:39:23,342
We want to rehearse here tonight.

741
00:39:23,422 --> 00:39:25,182
Hold on. Hold on a second.

742
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,742
What about family? What about history?

743
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:31,062
What if we save this lot?

744
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:34,582
What if I could guarantee you
that I could sell every car off this lot?

745
00:39:34,662 --> 00:39:36,622
Ben, that's foolish.
You don't even know this guy.

746
00:39:36,702 --> 00:39:39,942
Look at him.
He's a gun for hire, a tramp.

747
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:42,902
Don, we're talking about over 140 cars.

748
00:39:42,982 --> 00:39:45,262
Sure, it'd help the lot,
but that's impossible.

749
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,942
All right.
Look, either I sell every car on this lot,

750
00:39:47,982 --> 00:39:50,782
or I leave Temecula
and get out of the game for good.

751
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:54,022
- Doesn't move me at all.
- And you get Brent Gage for the night.

752
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:57,422
Sorry, Stu, but the deal's off,
at least till I see how this thing pans out.

753
00:39:57,502 --> 00:39:58,902
Okay.

754
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:01,062
You know,
since you're almost family, Ben,

755
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:02,182
here's what I'm gonna do.

756
00:40:02,262 --> 00:40:07,182
I'm gonna save you a job on my lot,
after the bank forecloses on yours.

757
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:10,062
Damn it. Why are they standing
in the way of my dreams, Daddy?

758
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:11,382
Look it, here's the deal.

759
00:40:11,462 --> 00:40:14,302
Call your TV guy. Tell him we got to cut
some new spots right away.

760
00:40:14,382 --> 00:40:16,902
I have a script for you, never fails.

761
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:20,942
<i>More than words</i>

762
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:27,022
<i>Is all you have to do to make it real</i>

763
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:28,742
Wait, now, so,

764
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:32,902
he offered to pay us off
and we could leave town flush.

765
00:40:32,982 --> 00:40:34,542
And you said no.

766
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:36,422
Yep.

767
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:38,342
- Motherfucker.
- Hey, chill, chill!

768
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:40,502
Come on, man, calm down. It's Don.

769
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:42,182
He wouldn't do it
if he didn't have a good reason.

770
00:40:42,262 --> 00:40:44,382
And then I told Ben
that if we don't sell all the cars

771
00:40:44,462 --> 00:40:46,342
that he could have Brent for the night.

772
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:48,022
- Motherfucker...
- All right. All right.

773
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:50,422
- Jibby, handle him.
- Calm down. Calm down now.

774
00:40:50,502 --> 00:40:52,902
All right, here's the scenario, all right?

775
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:55,302
Tomorrow, I'm gonna sell
an assload of cars.

776
00:40:55,342 --> 00:40:58,742
And I suggest
you gentlemen do likewise.

777
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:03,622
What the hell we gonna do?

778
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:07,982
Why don't we chill a little bit, Jibs?
Just chill. Okay, it's cool.

779
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:10,142
Don said we got
TV spots tomorrow, right?

780
00:41:10,222 --> 00:41:13,382
Bice is hitting town.
We're gonna pull this off.

781
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:19,382
<i>I'm gonna hit you with a little Seger.</i>

782
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:21,742
<i>Superbad, eyes up here, let's focus.</i>

783
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,502
<i>This one goes out to Blake.</i>

784
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:28,382
<i>It's about a boy, the son of a man,</i>
<i>a mother's child.</i>

785
00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:30,942
<i>Let's get him a tissue,</i>
<i>'cause it's about to get raw.</i>

786
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,662
What the fuck is wrong with that guy?

787
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:36,222
<i>On a long and Ionesome highway</i>

788
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:38,022
<i>East of Omaha</i>

789
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,942
Okay, I got to ask you a question.
Does Don know what he's doing?

790
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:45,382
I've seen that man say a lot of crap
just to sell cars and move out of town.

791
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:48,662
But this time, he really means it.

792
00:41:48,742 --> 00:41:50,262
Truth be told,

793
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,782
he ain't been the same since 'Querque.

794
00:41:53,862 --> 00:41:56,262
- 'Querque?
- The Duke City.

795
00:41:56,302 --> 00:41:58,502
A-Town. Captain Kirk.

796
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:01,422
Albuquerque.

797
00:42:02,582 --> 00:42:04,902
- Who calls it Captain Kirk?
- I don't know.

798
00:42:06,142 --> 00:42:07,782
We lost a good man down there.

799
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:09,502
- He quit?
- Died.

800
00:42:10,182 --> 00:42:12,302
- From a car sale?
- Hell, yes.

801
00:42:12,382 --> 00:42:16,062
The rest of us come to terms.
Don's still fighting it.

802
00:42:17,742 --> 00:42:18,742
Wow.

803
00:42:18,822 --> 00:42:22,302
Only Jeff Robins wasn't looking,
so I pegged him in the head.

804
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:27,622
- What is it?
- It's really a fun juice.

805
00:42:27,662 --> 00:42:30,462
- Okay.
- Okay. Just don't tell your dad.

806
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,422
You know what else is really fun?

807
00:42:34,062 --> 00:42:36,102
Going to a motel and wrestling.

808
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:39,502
I love wrestling.
I can get you into a figure four leg-lock.

809
00:42:39,582 --> 00:42:42,742
Like this.
You know, your legs'll be all tied up.

810
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:43,942
Sold.

811
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,902
- You'd be screaming.
- That sounds fantastic.

812
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,102
Okay.

813
00:42:47,822 --> 00:42:49,862
- Are you good at keeping secrets?
- Absolutely.

814
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:52,142
'Cause I've got a present for you.

815
00:42:52,182 --> 00:42:53,702
Secret present outside,
by the dumpster.

816
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,742
Is it a baseball mitt?

817
00:42:55,822 --> 00:42:59,302
Fits you like a baseball mitt,
like a glove, I hope.

818
00:42:59,382 --> 00:43:00,782
Is it new or is it old?

819
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:02,582
It will be new for you.

820
00:43:02,662 --> 00:43:04,582
All right, that means
I'm gonna have to break it in.

821
00:43:04,622 --> 00:43:05,622
- Yep.
- I'm gonna have to break it in.

822
00:43:05,702 --> 00:43:08,662
I'm gonna have to...
I'll put a ball in there, and I'll tie it off.

823
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:09,702
Right.

824
00:43:09,742 --> 00:43:12,942
And then I'll put lotions and oil on it,
and I'll sleep with it under my pillow.

825
00:43:13,742 --> 00:43:16,462
<i>Yeah. That was</i> Turn the Page
<i>by Bob Seger.</i>

826
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:18,382
<i>I'm Don Ready. Good night.</i>

827
00:43:21,502 --> 00:43:24,022
So listen, let's meet outside
by the dumpster...

828
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:28,182
- Hey, it's 11:30, closing time.
- Oh, man.

829
00:43:28,262 --> 00:43:29,702
- I got to go home.
- No. No.

830
00:43:29,782 --> 00:43:32,142
No, I got to go home,
put my pajamas on, and I got to shave.

831
00:43:32,222 --> 00:43:34,182
I know, but, Peter, before we do this,
we'll just...

832
00:43:34,222 --> 00:43:36,662
- We can wrestle later.
- No. In fact, I'm gonna...

833
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,342
Waitress, can we get
another whiskey sour?

834
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:40,302
- Just for the road, and a...
- We're closed.

835
00:43:40,342 --> 00:43:43,542
...paper cup, please. God damn it!
Just one more drink.

836
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,702
I'll cut off your tits with a knife, you bitch!

837
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:49,062
Babs, listen, I like the energy.
Let's play through.

838
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:53,862
Party back at the Hacienda Courts.
Everyone's welcome. No guys.

839
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:57,182
<i>If you want to go far</i>
<i>Put yourself in a kicking car</i>

840
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:02,622
<i>At Selleck Motors</i>

841
00:44:03,502 --> 00:44:05,982
<i>I started Selleck Motors</i>
<i>almost 40 years ago,</i>

842
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:09,702
<i>and I've had a good run</i>
<i>here at my dealership, and in life.</i>

843
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:15,022
<i>But now I'm dying, Temecula.</i>
<i>I got cancer of the nads.</i>

844
00:44:15,582 --> 00:44:19,822
<i>But before I die, I want to see</i>
<i>one last big Fourth of July blowout.</i>

845
00:44:20,342 --> 00:44:23,662
<i>So, my family and I are asking you</i>
<i>to come on down to Selleck Motors</i>

846
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,942
<i>and buy one final car from us</i>
<i>before I'm dead.</i>

847
00:44:30,182 --> 00:44:35,182
<i>Looks like the chemo is kicking in,</i>
<i>so you better hurry.</i>

848
00:44:37,982 --> 00:44:41,502
- Jesus, Ben, why didn't you tell me?
- Daddy.

849
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:45,062
It's just a commercial, Peter.

850
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:48,262
And, Brent, my privates are fine,
I swear to God.

851
00:44:48,302 --> 00:44:50,022
Good for you, Ben.

852
00:44:51,662 --> 00:44:54,382
It's gonna work, Ben.
It's gonna work like gangbusters.

853
00:44:54,422 --> 00:44:55,382
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

854
00:45:00,222 --> 00:45:03,862
Okay, if you don't like the car,
then go buy a truck, cheapskates!

855
00:45:03,942 --> 00:45:08,422
Every day, it's a gay safari.
Give me the balloon back. Piece of shit.

856
00:45:08,462 --> 00:45:10,022
- Thank you. We appreciate this.
- I'm so sorry.

857
00:45:10,062 --> 00:45:12,182
If there's anything I can do...

858
00:45:12,262 --> 00:45:15,022
It's such a tragedy. Tammy's so brave.

859
00:45:15,062 --> 00:45:17,582
Hey, Don. I'm not sure this is working.

860
00:45:17,662 --> 00:45:21,622
I mean, people clearly care about me
and all, but we're not selling cars.

861
00:45:21,702 --> 00:45:22,742
Stay positive, Ben.

862
00:45:22,822 --> 00:45:25,262
We're gonna hit this hard until 3:00.
When Bice gets here,

863
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:27,182
he's gonna take it over the top.

864
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:30,182
Hey.

865
00:45:30,382 --> 00:45:31,902
Can you bring the mood up?

866
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:35,982
You know, play something good?
Like <i>Y.M.C.A.</i> by the Village People.

867
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:37,742
You read my mind.

868
00:45:42,462 --> 00:45:47,022
Just out of curiosity,
what time do you get down from there?

869
00:45:47,062 --> 00:45:51,382
Every day they will test you.
Every day they will push you to the brink.

870
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:55,142
You must fight them, DJ. Fight them.

871
00:45:57,782 --> 00:45:58,982
I'm gonna do something that I don't do.

872
00:45:59,062 --> 00:46:00,582
I'm gonna throw in some free floor mats,
all right?

873
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:02,822
Now hold on. Hold...

874
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:04,942
- Jesus.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

875
00:46:05,022 --> 00:46:06,302
Don! What's going on?

876
00:46:06,382 --> 00:46:08,222
You know what?
If you would've told me 10 years ago

877
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:10,742
that I were to hit the wall
in a three-day sale in Temecula...

878
00:46:10,822 --> 00:46:13,702
- You're hitting the wall now?
- Well, yeah.

879
00:46:13,782 --> 00:46:16,822
Let me ask you something.
What do you think this means?

880
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:19,142
- I had this dream. I was just saying...
- Yo! Hey!

881
00:46:19,182 --> 00:46:21,342
...you know, "Listen, Don, you're a..."
- Ivy, let's go.

882
00:46:21,422 --> 00:46:24,622
We got lunch with my mom in,
like, two seconds.

883
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:26,382
- Be right there.
- We got to hurry.

884
00:46:26,462 --> 00:46:29,342
She'll be drunk in about 15, so giddy-up.

885
00:46:29,982 --> 00:46:32,942
- Don, what happened in Albuquerque?
- Nothing. Nothing happened.

886
00:46:33,022 --> 00:46:34,662
You kidding? It was...

887
00:46:34,742 --> 00:46:40,302
Listen, go have a great lunch with...
With your fiancé.

888
00:46:40,982 --> 00:46:42,782
Time to hit the road.

889
00:46:43,462 --> 00:46:46,222
Hey, Don Ready,
looks like you had a rough day.

890
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,222
It's okay,
sometimes it happens in the auto trade.

891
00:46:49,302 --> 00:46:50,902
If you suck.

892
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:55,822
Hold on.

893
00:46:56,182 --> 00:46:58,822
You got to admit, dude,
that was a good exit line.

894
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:00,782
- Right? I got a better one.
- Yeah.

895
00:47:00,822 --> 00:47:04,942
Hey, Don Ready, I'll see you in
l-Don't-Know-How-To-Sell-Cars-Ville.

896
00:47:05,902 --> 00:47:07,662
Yeah, that one, granted, not as good,

897
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:11,102
but that's 'cause
I won't be in that town. Fucker.

898
00:47:11,982 --> 00:47:15,502
Damn it. Psych. Psych.
I just psyched you out.

899
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,902
I'm going that way, so fuck you.

900
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:19,782
<i>All right, people.</i>

901
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:24,422
<i>We got Eric Bice, brother of Bo Bice,</i>
<i>coming up in the next five minutes.</i>

902
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:26,222
<i>You might want to sit</i>
<i>in one of our cars...</i>

903
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:29,702
Hell of a turnout for Bice.
This day's starting to look up, huh?

904
00:47:29,782 --> 00:47:32,902
We need it.
We're getting killed out there today.

905
00:47:33,502 --> 00:47:35,942
- Don, we got problems, big problems.
- What's up?

906
00:47:36,022 --> 00:47:37,982
- Bice isn't showing.
- What?

907
00:47:38,062 --> 00:47:40,782
His booking agent said
he's got adult chickenpox.

908
00:47:40,862 --> 00:47:42,382
But he gave me some other options.

909
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:45,222
The mascot for the San Jose Sharks
hockey team.

910
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,462
He'll show,
but he can't wear the Shark suit.

911
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:49,422
What's this I'm hearing about Bice?

912
00:47:49,462 --> 00:47:52,102
He motherfucked us.
He motherfucked us like a pro.

913
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:54,022
- I'm going on.
- What?

914
00:47:54,102 --> 00:47:55,782
- I'm going on.
- No, wait, Don, be careful.

915
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:58,142
I'm getting a real sketchy vibe
from this crowd.

916
00:47:58,222 --> 00:47:59,822
Ivy, don't you see? This is everything.

917
00:47:59,902 --> 00:48:03,022
I get to sing, which sells more cars,
which helps your family.

918
00:48:03,102 --> 00:48:06,342
Plus, my son gets to see the old man
come through in the clutch.

919
00:48:07,822 --> 00:48:08,902
What son?

920
00:48:08,982 --> 00:48:11,742
Eric Bice! Eric Bice!

921
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:13,902
<i>Hey, everyone!</i>

922
00:48:14,742 --> 00:48:17,342
<i>I'm Don Ready. I'm a car salesman.</i>

923
00:48:17,422 --> 00:48:18,702
This is gonna go well.

924
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:21,062
<i>Yeah. Now, unfortunately,</i>

925
00:48:21,102 --> 00:48:26,502
<i>Eric Bice has adult chickenpox,</i>
<i>but I'm gonna be filling in for him.</i>

926
00:48:26,582 --> 00:48:27,942
<i>Drop it!</i>

927
00:48:31,022 --> 00:48:36,102
<i>Just take those old records off the shelf</i>
<i>I'll sit and listen to them by myself</i>

928
00:48:36,142 --> 00:48:38,902
He's no Bice! He's no Bice!

929
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:42,222
Yeah, I should've said something.
Don's a bad singer.

930
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:43,622
<i>I want that old time rock and roll</i>

931
00:48:43,662 --> 00:48:45,822
Fuck you!

932
00:48:45,902 --> 00:48:49,582
Aren't you people tired
of being screwed over?

933
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:52,222
Then let's fucking riot!

934
00:48:52,902 --> 00:48:54,502
<i>Hold up a minute!</i>

935
00:48:54,782 --> 00:48:55,782
Get him!

936
00:48:55,862 --> 00:48:57,062
<i>Stop it!</i>

937
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:58,982
<i>Hey... Hello! Hey, guys!</i>

938
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:01,382
Mr. Selleck, we got to get you
out of here. Come on.

939
00:49:01,422 --> 00:49:03,862
We got to hide, Brent.
We'll be safe in my room.

940
00:49:04,782 --> 00:49:06,302
Hold up a minute!

941
00:49:07,062 --> 00:49:09,542
Hold on! I got a big show!

942
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:14,342
<i>This does not look good for you,</i>
<i>Uncle Sam.</i>

943
00:49:18,102 --> 00:49:19,782
<i>And concussion.</i>

944
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:27,942
<i>Don't mess with him!</i>
<i>That kid's got retard strength!</i>

945
00:49:27,982 --> 00:49:29,262
Dork!

946
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:30,502
<i>See.</i>

947
00:49:35,942 --> 00:49:38,222
<i>Who the fuck brought alligators?</i>

948
00:49:39,582 --> 00:49:43,782
<i>I never thought I'd say this,</i>
<i>but thank God the police are here.</i>

949
00:49:43,822 --> 00:49:45,462
<i>Welcome, police.</i>

950
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:49,022
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>let's lock up some white people.</i>

951
00:49:49,942 --> 00:49:51,742
<i>Y'all are all retarded.</i>

952
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:53,222
<i>Hello?</i>

953
00:49:56,102 --> 00:49:58,302
This day is completely shot.

954
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:01,022
Can you believe these animals?

955
00:50:01,102 --> 00:50:03,422
What the hell's happening
to this country?

956
00:50:04,182 --> 00:50:07,662
What are you talking about, Dick?
You started it.

957
00:50:07,742 --> 00:50:12,102
You remember? Cops gave you a ticket
for inciting a riot. You old goat.

958
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:15,942
This is horrible. Let's face it. It's over.

959
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:18,622
It's not over. Over?

960
00:50:19,222 --> 00:50:23,982
When is the last time that there were
that many cameras on this lot?

961
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,862
We got five hours left in this day, okay?

962
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:29,102
Now, I intend to sell some cars,
all right?

963
00:50:29,182 --> 00:50:31,142
Now, get in here. Let's go over
some talking points. Come on.

964
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:37,662
<i>Baby, if you are true</i>

965
00:50:38,542 --> 00:50:40,422
<i>I'll keep doing it</i>

966
00:50:41,582 --> 00:50:43,942
<i>Doing it, right there, to you</i>

967
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:45,662
<i>Doing it</i>

968
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:47,982
<i>Doing it</i>

969
00:50:48,742 --> 00:50:50,302
<i>Doing it</i>

970
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:53,142
<i>Doing it to you</i>

971
00:50:53,222 --> 00:50:56,182
<i>Julio, pick up line nine. Julio, line nine.</i>

972
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,542
You know, look, guys,
the big problem here?

973
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:01,022
We need a bigger rehearsal space.

974
00:51:01,102 --> 00:51:02,982
Not a problem. Here's why.

975
00:51:03,022 --> 00:51:06,022
Huge riot down at Selleck Motors.
The place is going down in flames.

976
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,742
We're taking it over.
It is the new Big Ups rehearsal space.

977
00:51:08,782 --> 00:51:10,342
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

978
00:51:10,382 --> 00:51:11,862
We're gonna...
We're gonna take it over.

979
00:51:11,942 --> 00:51:12,902
Pardon me, boys.

980
00:51:14,902 --> 00:51:17,222
Some bad news from Selleck Motors.
Look at this.

981
00:51:17,262 --> 00:51:19,342
<i>Listen, people get excited</i>
<i>over used cars,</i>

982
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:21,782
<i>and, occasionally,</i>
<i>they'll punch and burn things.</i>

983
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:23,302
<i>Now, some call that a riot.</i>

984
00:51:23,382 --> 00:51:26,782
<i>Me? I call it excitement</i>
<i>over the low, low prices</i>

985
00:51:26,862 --> 00:51:29,222
<i>down here at Ben Selleck Motors.</i>

986
00:51:29,302 --> 00:51:31,662
<i>The police are the real heroes.</i>

987
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:33,222
<i>And because of that, we're offering</i>

988
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,982
<i>20% off and 0% financing</i>

989
00:51:36,062 --> 00:51:39,742
<i>to any police officer that comes down,</i>
<i>anyone with a police hat,</i>

990
00:51:39,822 --> 00:51:42,062
<i>anyone that says the word "police."</i>

991
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:46,862
This Don Ready is like the rash
between my balls and thigh.

992
00:51:46,902 --> 00:51:51,302
<i>And if you find an alligator in your car,</i>
<i>$500 off!</i>

993
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:54,102
Congratulations, Officer.

994
00:51:54,182 --> 00:51:56,702
You see that, Ben?
Just like that, we're back in business.

995
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:08,142
Motherfucker, I ring the bell.

996
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:10,022
The reason that the Japanese outsell us

997
00:52:10,062 --> 00:52:12,302
is because they make
more fuel-efficient vehicles

998
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:16,142
while Detroit insists on
pushing gas-guzzling SUVs.

999
00:52:16,222 --> 00:52:18,942
God damn, girl, you turning me on.

1000
00:52:20,062 --> 00:52:23,462
Would it be improper of me
to ask you out for a drink tonight?

1001
00:52:23,502 --> 00:52:27,182
I don't know, Jibby.
I've been hurt before.

1002
00:52:27,222 --> 00:52:31,182
Well, my problem is
I ain't never allowed myself to be hurt.

1003
00:52:31,262 --> 00:52:33,062
I'm trying to be more vulnerable.

1004
00:52:33,382 --> 00:52:35,462
Well, you're an honest man, Jibby,

1005
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:39,022
and honesty is the first step
to being vulnerable.

1006
00:52:39,662 --> 00:52:41,742
You can pick me up at 9:00.

1007
00:52:50,742 --> 00:52:52,822
- Hey, Don.
- Hey, Jibs.

1008
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:54,502
What's with the shit-eating grin?

1009
00:52:54,582 --> 00:52:56,822
For the first time in my life,

1010
00:52:56,902 --> 00:53:00,422
I have a chance
to make love to a woman.

1011
00:53:02,942 --> 00:53:04,102
Love.

1012
00:53:10,022 --> 00:53:11,742
I'm glad we found the right car for you.

1013
00:53:16,782 --> 00:53:18,422
Hey, Blake, you ready?

1014
00:53:19,022 --> 00:53:20,302
For what?

1015
00:53:20,622 --> 00:53:21,622
A little catch.

1016
00:53:22,222 --> 00:53:24,542
You know, I'm starting to think
that maybe lvy was right,

1017
00:53:24,622 --> 00:53:26,062
maybe it's time for old Don Ready

1018
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:29,782
to settle down and plant some roots
in this crazy old world.

1019
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:31,542
Great.

1020
00:53:31,622 --> 00:53:35,862
I mean, I've been on the move for
so long that I've never taken time to stop

1021
00:53:35,942 --> 00:53:38,982
and to hug the people
that are important in my life.

1022
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:42,582
And, Blake, don't ever think that
you're not important. All right?

1023
00:53:43,462 --> 00:53:44,662
Great.

1024
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:47,382
You ever think about your daddy?

1025
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:49,502
No.

1026
00:53:49,582 --> 00:53:50,662
I mean, who wants to think about

1027
00:53:50,702 --> 00:53:54,142
some piece of shit that gets
a woman pregnant and then takes off?

1028
00:53:54,222 --> 00:53:57,742
You know, I'm not bitter.
I did fine without him.

1029
00:53:59,342 --> 00:54:02,542
He's probably out there with no family,
nothing real to hold onto.

1030
00:54:02,622 --> 00:54:06,182
Can you imagine how meaningless
life must be for a prick like that?

1031
00:54:06,222 --> 00:54:07,462
What a douche.

1032
00:54:17,142 --> 00:54:18,342
- Hey.
- Hey.

1033
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:23,102
I cannot believe this riot actually helped.
You are insane.

1034
00:54:23,982 --> 00:54:25,662
You know,
I'm gonna be sorry to see you go.

1035
00:54:25,742 --> 00:54:28,742
Well, lvy,
goodbyes are an occupational hazard.

1036
00:54:30,822 --> 00:54:31,982
Okay, wow.

1037
00:54:32,782 --> 00:54:34,662
I don't know what's going on with you.

1038
00:54:34,742 --> 00:54:35,942
You are hot, you are cold.

1039
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:38,662
One minute you're happy,
then you're snapping at me.

1040
00:54:38,702 --> 00:54:39,862
I mean...

1041
00:54:40,782 --> 00:54:42,262
What happened in Albuquerque?

1042
00:54:42,342 --> 00:54:44,302
You don't want to know what happened
in 'Querque.

1043
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:46,422
Actually, I do.

1044
00:54:46,502 --> 00:54:50,022
Come on, what? You can trust me.
Just let your guard down.

1045
00:54:54,102 --> 00:54:56,302
McDermott was my best friend

1046
00:54:56,382 --> 00:54:59,662
and the greatest car-sale DJ
anyone's ever seen.

1047
00:55:00,142 --> 00:55:03,022
Damn it, it shouldn't have
gone down like that!

1048
00:55:03,102 --> 00:55:05,742
I was all wrapped up with this woman.
It wasn't gonna work.

1049
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:08,342
I knew that. Blah, blah, blah.
I was trying to impress her.

1050
00:55:08,422 --> 00:55:10,502
We had already sold a bunch of cars
that weekend,

1051
00:55:10,582 --> 00:55:12,102
but I wanted to take it over the top.

1052
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,822
So, I thought, hey,
let's put a few bucks into it, you know?

1053
00:55:15,862 --> 00:55:21,222
Get a good crowd in there. We'd airdrop
McDermott in, dressed as Abe Lincoln.

1054
00:55:21,302 --> 00:55:22,902
He would float in and say...

1055
00:55:22,982 --> 00:55:25,102
I freed the slaves, now I'm gonna free

1056
00:55:25,182 --> 00:55:27,782
those cars from the slavery
of high prices!

1057
00:55:27,822 --> 00:55:29,742
<i>We had a bunch of great lines</i>
<i>for him to say.</i>

1058
00:55:29,822 --> 00:55:31,502
Hey, just like John Wilkes Booth,

1059
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:35,022
our prices are gonna sneak up
behind you and blow your brains out!

1060
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:37,862
When I asked him, he didn't even blink.
He just did it.

1061
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:40,662
Thanks, buddy.
This is the thrill of a lifetime!

1062
00:55:40,742 --> 00:55:43,182
Drop zone! Drop zone!

1063
00:55:43,262 --> 00:55:45,662
Me, I was on the ground
with Mrs. Talero.

1064
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:49,022
We planned to meet
in the back of a Taurus.

1065
00:55:49,102 --> 00:55:51,782
That is so good. My husband never
does that to me anymore. Oh, yes.

1066
00:55:51,822 --> 00:55:54,542
She had me pack a bag
of sexual accoutrements.

1067
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:58,302
Basic shit, you know,
rubbers, lube, dildos.

1068
00:55:58,382 --> 00:56:01,382
Weirder stuff.
Executioners' masks, French ticklers.

1069
00:56:01,462 --> 00:56:02,422
Yeah! Take me away!

1070
00:56:02,502 --> 00:56:05,382
The only problem was
I took the wrong bag.

1071
00:56:08,902 --> 00:56:12,822
Fuck! Don gave me the wrong bag!

1072
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,102
I can only imagine
what was going through

1073
00:56:14,182 --> 00:56:17,542
McDermott's head
as he fell to his death.

1074
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,582
Got to try to get away from this dildo!

1075
00:56:19,662 --> 00:56:21,102
<i>The regrets he must've had.</i>

1076
00:56:21,182 --> 00:56:23,022
Most people who are in this situation,

1077
00:56:23,062 --> 00:56:27,622
their life flashes before their eyes
and they go through a list of regrets!

1078
00:56:27,662 --> 00:56:32,622
For the next 45 seconds, I want to go
through the list of things I've done right!

1079
00:56:32,702 --> 00:56:37,622
Number one, full-length back tattoo
of the Hawaiian Punch guy!

1080
00:56:37,702 --> 00:56:40,502
10% real fruit juice, motherfuckers!

1081
00:56:40,582 --> 00:56:43,422
He had a huge heart,
but, my God, was he stupid.

1082
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:48,182
Number three, had my wisdom teeth
put back into my skull!

1083
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:53,542
Christ, the dildo's back!

1084
00:56:54,902 --> 00:56:59,622
I'm gonna get into an aerodynamic tuck
and use the dildo to cushion my fall!

1085
00:57:02,382 --> 00:57:04,062
I killed my best friend.

1086
00:57:04,142 --> 00:57:08,382
I wish I could say
I didn't think it would end this way!

1087
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:11,462
But I got to tell you,
I always knew it would!

1088
00:57:11,502 --> 00:57:15,942
Falling to my death, dressed as
Abe Lincoln, holding a big, purple dildo!

1089
00:57:16,022 --> 00:57:18,182
This is how I drew it up.

1090
00:57:20,942 --> 00:57:23,702
<i>Next thing I know, it's raining dildos.</i>

1091
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:31,102
Had I just been focused on the sale,
it wouldn't have gone down like that.

1092
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:34,062
Now it's all happening again,
with you and Blake.

1093
00:57:34,142 --> 00:57:36,222
I'm losing who I am and my focus.

1094
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:39,142
You think that riot was an accident?
No, no, no.

1095
00:57:39,182 --> 00:57:42,902
It happened because I lost my focus.
That was damn good Seger.

1096
00:57:44,102 --> 00:57:47,742
And now I'm falling for you. Yeah, no,
not again. I'm not gonna do that.

1097
00:57:47,822 --> 00:57:49,022
Wait, Don, come on, don't go.

1098
00:57:49,102 --> 00:57:51,902
I'm gonna go sell some cars,
Mrs. Harding.

1099
00:57:54,662 --> 00:57:55,622
"Z."

1100
00:57:56,702 --> 00:57:57,662
Seven.

1101
00:57:58,582 --> 00:58:00,742
- Hey, guys.
- Brent.

1102
00:58:01,342 --> 00:58:03,302
I have to say something.

1103
00:58:03,342 --> 00:58:05,902
I think Don might think I'm his son.

1104
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:10,462
Now, I've met my dad. He lives in
Louisiana. I just wasn't raised by him.

1105
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:13,262
Don's going through
a lot of big changes in his life,

1106
00:58:13,302 --> 00:58:16,622
and right now you might be
the rock he's holding onto.

1107
00:58:18,422 --> 00:58:20,302
Are you saying
I should pretend to be his son?

1108
00:58:20,342 --> 00:58:21,582
Because, Brent, that's fucked up.

1109
00:58:21,662 --> 00:58:24,102
Is it? Or is it fucked down?

1110
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:28,502
Look, Don Ready would make
a damn good father to you,

1111
00:58:28,582 --> 00:58:31,622
and right now, I don't see a lot of guys
lining up for the job.

1112
00:58:31,702 --> 00:58:34,342
Think about that. And while you're at it,

1113
00:58:34,382 --> 00:58:37,102
you think about why your dad left you.

1114
00:58:38,742 --> 00:58:42,182
Come in here and blame Don.
That's pathetic.

1115
00:58:46,662 --> 00:58:50,342
<i>It's about 20 minutes on the down side</i>
<i>of 9:00 here at Selleck Motors.</i>

1116
00:58:50,382 --> 00:58:54,622
<i>I hope you're curled up with</i>
<i>your best girl, making music together</i>

1117
00:58:54,702 --> 00:58:56,702
<i>in between the sheets.</i>

1118
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:03,542
Look at this. You know, everyone's gone,
so you can shut it down. Thank you.

1119
00:59:03,622 --> 00:59:05,902
<i>Looks like that's gonna do it for me.</i>

1120
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:10,062
<i>Good night, sweet Temecula.</i>
<i>May all your loves be tender...</i>

1121
00:59:10,142 --> 00:59:13,422
- Seriously! Shut it the fuck down!
- Thank you.

1122
00:59:16,742 --> 00:59:21,542
<i>See, I don't do what I'm told.</i>
<i>I'm what's called contrarian, all right?</i>

1123
00:59:21,622 --> 00:59:23,902
<i>I hate...</i>

1124
00:59:23,982 --> 00:59:26,782
<i>You gonna turn the lights off on me?</i>
<i>Like that's gonna scare me?</i>

1125
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:28,782
<i>I don't give a fuck!</i>

1126
00:59:28,862 --> 00:59:30,542
I'm homeless, motherfuckers!

1127
00:59:56,782 --> 00:59:58,622
Wow! Hey...

1128
01:00:00,062 --> 01:00:01,222
Come on in.

1129
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:03,822
Shouldn't you be at home
with Bell Biv DeVoe

1130
01:00:03,902 --> 01:00:05,262
writing personalized vows or some shit?

1131
01:00:05,342 --> 01:00:08,182
Don, I'm here.
Don't make me change my mind.

1132
01:00:11,662 --> 01:00:14,862
<i>Yo, we're Temecula's</i>
<i>number-one pop sensation.</i>

1133
01:00:14,942 --> 01:00:16,062
- <i>Big Ups!</i>
- <i>Big Ups!</i>

1134
01:00:16,142 --> 01:00:17,342
<i>And we're gonna be kicking it live,</i>

1135
01:00:17,422 --> 01:00:20,022
<i>right here at Harding Imports tomorrow,</i>
<i>so come on down!</i>

1136
01:00:20,102 --> 01:00:22,542
- Congrats again on that. Yeah.
- Thanks.

1137
01:00:22,622 --> 01:00:24,862
- You want to turn it off?
- He needs to see this.

1138
01:00:24,942 --> 01:00:29,222
<i>With lease-to-own options</i>
<i>and a full-service garage</i>

1139
01:00:38,582 --> 01:00:40,462
We're gonna make love.

1140
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,582
Love.

1141
01:00:43,142 --> 01:00:44,462
Love.

1142
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:46,622
Love.

1143
01:00:48,702 --> 01:00:51,222
- Head & Shoulders?
- How'd you know?

1144
01:00:51,302 --> 01:00:53,142
My uncle uses it.

1145
01:00:57,062 --> 01:00:59,622
We're actually making love.

1146
01:00:59,702 --> 01:01:01,942
I'm making love.

1147
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:04,702
We're making love.

1148
01:01:04,782 --> 01:01:08,022
You know what nobody ever told me
about making love?

1149
01:01:08,102 --> 01:01:10,902
- What?
- How boring it is.

1150
01:01:10,982 --> 01:01:12,262
Yeah.

1151
01:01:13,742 --> 01:01:17,422
You can do anything you want.
My safe word is "blueberry pancakes."

1152
01:01:17,502 --> 01:01:18,582
Okay.

1153
01:01:27,662 --> 01:01:29,702
Let's have sex
in every corner of this room.

1154
01:01:29,742 --> 01:01:30,982
Okay.

1155
01:01:35,262 --> 01:01:37,182
I fucked up.
I should've got a bigger room.

1156
01:01:37,262 --> 01:01:40,262
- That's okay.
- I have points and I didn't use them.

1157
01:01:58,702 --> 01:02:00,782
Continental breakfast in bed.

1158
01:02:00,862 --> 01:02:02,942
- Hacienda Courts style.
- Wow.

1159
01:02:03,022 --> 01:02:04,742
You know why
this is the best breakfast?

1160
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:06,822
- Why?
- Bear claws, crullers,

1161
01:02:06,902 --> 01:02:09,622
prison-size orange juice.

1162
01:02:10,302 --> 01:02:13,862
You know, I actually feel bad for Paxton.

1163
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:17,462
I didn't mean to come in
and split you guys up,

1164
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:20,062
but engagements are made
to be broken.

1165
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:23,622
Don, I'm not leaving Paxton.

1166
01:02:24,902 --> 01:02:26,502
What?

1167
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,142
You don't love him.

1168
01:02:28,902 --> 01:02:31,462
Well, now, that's not necessarily true.

1169
01:02:31,502 --> 01:02:34,502
And, you know, I'm almost 30 years old.

1170
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,382
I mean, what am I supposed to do,
you know?

1171
01:02:37,422 --> 01:02:39,302
I want things,

1172
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:42,782
and I want a family,
and Paxton wants those things, too.

1173
01:02:46,942 --> 01:02:50,262
I mean, look, nobody dreams of buying
an '88 Lynx station wagon,

1174
01:02:50,342 --> 01:02:52,142
but we sold one yesterday, right?

1175
01:02:52,222 --> 01:02:53,622
And the people who bought it, bought it

1176
01:02:53,702 --> 01:02:56,942
because buying a 2007 Land Rover
wasn't an option for them.

1177
01:02:57,022 --> 01:02:58,662
So, what are my options, Don?

1178
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:01,382
What about us? What about giving us
a chance? I mean...

1179
01:03:01,462 --> 01:03:03,702
Where, in the Hacienda Courts
in Boise?

1180
01:03:03,782 --> 01:03:05,422
Or how about
the Hacienda Courts in Wichita?

1181
01:03:05,502 --> 01:03:06,582
'Cause if things go really well,

1182
01:03:06,662 --> 01:03:09,262
we could raise our kids
in the Hacienda Courts in Muskogee.

1183
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:11,662
What did you even come here for?

1184
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:16,182
Because I wanted one last fling.

1185
01:03:16,262 --> 01:03:19,862
And I know
you're not gonna stick around.

1186
01:03:19,942 --> 01:03:24,582
So, you're just gonna have sex with me
and then leave?

1187
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,902
This hurts!

1188
01:03:27,982 --> 01:03:30,262
Guess this is what
women mean when they say,

1189
01:03:30,342 --> 01:03:32,822
"So you're just gonna have sex
with me and leave? This hurts."

1190
01:03:34,702 --> 01:03:36,182
I'm sorry.

1191
01:03:36,262 --> 01:03:39,982
Something that I want is being taken
away from me, and I don't like it!

1192
01:03:40,022 --> 01:03:43,862
I don't like it!
This is exactly how I felt after 'Querque!

1193
01:03:43,942 --> 01:03:45,422
Screw everybody!

1194
01:03:45,502 --> 01:03:49,662
The only thing that I trust
in this world is cars!

1195
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:07,182
Come on, Don!

1196
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:08,582
Come on!

1197
01:04:08,622 --> 01:04:10,262
- What's going on?
- Don!

1198
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:12,422
Don's never been late
for the last day of a sale.

1199
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:17,902
Don's gone,
and you did not see me here.

1200
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:19,782
Okay.

1201
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,302
Well, did he go to the lot?

1202
01:04:21,382 --> 01:04:24,582
I don't know.
He kind of just freaked out and left.

1203
01:04:27,062 --> 01:04:29,062
'Querque all over again.

1204
01:04:29,102 --> 01:04:30,822
Fucking 'Querque.

1205
01:04:38,622 --> 01:04:40,182
He's gone.

1206
01:04:40,262 --> 01:04:43,782
Looked everywhere, called the cops.
No one knows where he is.

1207
01:04:45,062 --> 01:04:48,702
I'm sorry, fellas,
I apologize from all of us.

1208
01:04:48,782 --> 01:04:50,662
No. Hold on.

1209
01:04:50,702 --> 01:04:52,182
You guys did your best.

1210
01:04:52,262 --> 01:04:54,822
I mean, it was an uphill battle
from the beginning, right?

1211
01:04:54,862 --> 01:04:57,702
But, hey! We still sold some cars, right?

1212
01:04:57,742 --> 01:04:59,942
We still sold some cars!

1213
01:05:01,342 --> 01:05:03,422
Might as well dust off the old résumé.

1214
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:06,822
Hey, wait just a minute.

1215
01:05:07,702 --> 01:05:10,662
I practically built this dealership myself,

1216
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:13,142
and I remember a day when
we wouldn't hang our heads

1217
01:05:13,222 --> 01:05:15,262
or talk about closing the lot.

1218
01:05:15,782 --> 01:05:19,782
A customer would walk in here
and this place would pop!

1219
01:05:19,862 --> 01:05:20,902
There you go, Ben.

1220
01:05:20,982 --> 01:05:23,982
And having Don "The Goods" Ready
here for three days

1221
01:05:24,062 --> 01:05:27,942
made me remember why I became
a car salesman in the first place.

1222
01:05:31,022 --> 01:05:32,902
Mr. Selleck's right.

1223
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:36,502
We can do this.
Don has taught us all something.

1224
01:05:36,582 --> 01:05:39,982
He knew more about us
than we knew about ourselves.

1225
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:41,142
Yeah.

1226
01:05:41,222 --> 01:05:46,062
You know, I never much cared for Jews,
queers or fucking Eskimos,

1227
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:48,262
but that's just the way I was brought up.

1228
01:05:49,502 --> 01:05:50,582
Is that it?

1229
01:05:50,662 --> 01:05:53,462
Yeah. That's it.
I just wanted to put that out there.

1230
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:56,422
I thought we were opening up here!

1231
01:05:56,502 --> 01:05:59,182
Guys. We can sell these cars.

1232
01:05:59,262 --> 01:06:02,342
- There you go!
- Ready has carried us this far.

1233
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:05,262
Well, I say we start
carrying our own weight.

1234
01:06:05,342 --> 01:06:08,982
So let's get out there and sell the metal!
Who's with me?

1235
01:06:09,062 --> 01:06:10,342
- We are!
- We are!

1236
01:06:10,382 --> 01:06:12,582
- I'm with you! Listen to him!
- We are! We are!

1237
01:06:12,662 --> 01:06:17,102
- We are! We are! We are!
- We are! We are! We are!

1238
01:06:17,422 --> 01:06:19,742
- <i>We are! We are! We are!</i>
- <i>We are! We are! We are!</i>

1239
01:06:22,102 --> 01:06:23,062
<i>You don't even know this guy.</i>

1240
01:06:23,142 --> 01:06:26,302
<i>Look at him.</i>
<i>He's a gun for hire, a tramp.</i>

1241
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:30,782
<i>He's probably out there with no family,</i>
<i>nothing real to hold onto.</i>

1242
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,342
<i>And I know</i>
<i>you're not gonna stick around.</i>

1243
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:36,142
<i>James Van Der Beek, my nigger.</i>

1244
01:06:39,822 --> 01:06:42,782
Well, if it isn't
Don goddamn fucking Ready.

1245
01:06:42,862 --> 01:06:45,662
Holy fuck. McDermott?

1246
01:06:46,662 --> 01:06:49,542
<i>He has returned</i>

1247
01:06:49,622 --> 01:06:52,542
<i>He is McDermott</i>

1248
01:06:52,622 --> 01:06:54,022
Oh, my God!

1249
01:06:54,102 --> 01:06:57,102
I been waiting a long time
to set the record straight with you, man.

1250
01:06:57,182 --> 01:07:00,902
<i>He's setting</i>
<i>the record straight, motherfucker</i>

1251
01:07:01,382 --> 01:07:05,462
I trusted you, Don. I trusted that what
we were doing was bigger than all of us.

1252
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:08,822
But it turns out, all you wanted to do
was get your ball sack played with

1253
01:07:08,902 --> 01:07:10,742
by some woman with bad credit.

1254
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:13,662
<i>It's an age-old tale</i>

1255
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:17,062

They let angels out of heaven
to cuss at people?

1258
01:07:20,782 --> 01:07:23,302
Yeah, of course.
That's what's going down, dipshit.

1259
01:07:23,382 --> 01:07:26,822
<i>Fuck you, Don Ready, fuck your family</i>

1260
01:07:27,822 --> 01:07:30,382
I don't get it, McDermott.
Man, you used to be so easygoing and...

1261
01:07:30,462 --> 01:07:33,862
Yeah, I was. I was easy breezy.
And then, guess what?

1262
01:07:33,942 --> 01:07:38,022
I fell out of a plane and hit the ground,
and I didn't bounce.

1263
01:07:38,102 --> 01:07:41,382
But you know what did bounce?
My butthole through my face.

1264

1265

I'm so sorry, McDermott.

1267
01:07:51,862 --> 01:07:55,182
I need your help, man. I feel so empty.

1268
01:07:55,262 --> 01:08:00,102
Don't you get it, Don? This is where
all the cars we sell end up.

1269
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:03,022
It's not about the cars.
It's about the team

1270
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:06,022
and finding people you love. That's it.

1271
01:08:06,062 --> 01:08:08,542
- What do I do?
- You know what to do.

1272
01:08:08,622 --> 01:08:12,782
Get off the road, man.
I mean, after 35, it just looks pathetic.

1275
01:08:19,902 --> 01:08:25,022
It's okay, man. I'll see you in 28 years.

01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:32,622
Choking on a sausage patty
at a strip club.

1279
01:08:32,702 --> 01:08:35,622
Is there any way they could sing it?
'Cause it sounds sad.

1280
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:40,022
No, it's not very lyrical, and it is sad.
So, no.

1281
01:08:40,102 --> 01:08:41,102
- A little bit? A little...
- No.

1282
01:08:41,182 --> 01:08:44,902
We talked about it in the heaven
spaceship that brought us here.

01:08:44,942 --> 01:08:47,302
- We got to jump. Change your ways.
- No, no.

1284
01:08:47,342 --> 01:08:48,782
See you, Don.

Oh, my God, lvy and the team,
they need me.

1286

They need me right now. Need me.

1287
01:08:57,302 --> 01:08:58,902
Thank you, McDermott!

1288
01:09:09,822 --> 01:09:12,582
Get them out of the back lot
and into the front!

1289

Let's go, let's go!

1290

really like this car. It's a good fit.

Good news.

All of it.

01:10:13,182 --> 01:10:15,622
Makes all the sense in the world!

1302
01:10:15,662 --> 01:10:19,262
One, two, three! Jump!

1303
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:23,622
You got yourself a good deal there.

1304
01:10:23,662 --> 01:10:26,062
Pop the clutch! Pop the clutch!

1305
01:10:27,662 --> 01:10:31,702
We did it.
We sold every last car on the lot.

1306
01:10:31,782 --> 01:10:34,662
Man, I wish Don was here to see this.

1307
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:41,502
Hey, look, everyone! It's Superman!

1308
01:10:41,582 --> 01:10:43,942
I want to come down
right at Selleck Motors, all right?

1309
01:10:43,982 --> 01:10:45,382
- Got it.
- All right.

1310
01:10:47,102 --> 01:10:48,742
Where are the cars?

1311
01:10:48,782 --> 01:10:50,582
Wait a minute! Is that Don?

1312
01:10:50,662 --> 01:10:52,662
Look out! Run! Run!

1313
01:10:52,742 --> 01:10:55,382
Watch your head, team! Coming in hot.

1314
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,342
Hey, Jibby, where are all the cars?

1315
01:11:02,382 --> 01:11:05,582
Don, we did it.
We sold every single one of them.

1316
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:08,462
You're shitting me. That's fantastic!

1317
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:10,182
- They all stepped up.
- Unbelievable.

1318
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:12,262
I'm proud of you guys, all of you!

1319
01:11:12,342 --> 01:11:14,422
We couldn't have done it without you,
Mr. Ready.

1320
01:11:14,502 --> 01:11:16,662
You taught us all to stand on our own.

1321
01:11:16,742 --> 01:11:19,782
Your time here has been rich
and filled with wisdom.

1322
01:11:19,822 --> 01:11:21,462
I don't know what to say.

1323
01:11:21,542 --> 01:11:24,182
Why not start with the truth, Don?

1324
01:11:24,262 --> 01:11:28,422
Well, the truth is, you sons of bitches
saved Selleck Motors!

1325
01:11:30,462 --> 01:11:32,782
Fuck you, Don Ready!

1326
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:36,662
You didn't sell all the cars. You lose.
You're losers.

1327
01:11:36,742 --> 01:11:40,422
What are you talking about? All the cars
are gone. Lot stays with the Sellecks.

1328
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:43,862
Come on, Stu, a deal's a deal.
We sold all the cars on the lot.

1329
01:11:43,942 --> 01:11:48,022
Nobody sold the Bandit Car.
Rules are rules. The lot's mine.

1330
01:11:48,102 --> 01:11:49,142
The Bandit Car?

1331
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,742
Don said every car on the lot.

1332
01:11:51,822 --> 01:11:54,662
Bandit Car's a car and it's on the lot.

1333
01:11:54,702 --> 01:11:57,142
Hold on a second. That thing is a prop.

1334
01:11:57,222 --> 01:12:00,262
Don, that is not a prop.
That is a $200,000 automobile.

1335
01:12:00,342 --> 01:12:01,582
This is good.

1336
01:12:01,662 --> 01:12:06,182
Is this the great Don Ready complaining
about how hard it is to sell a car?

1337
01:12:06,262 --> 01:12:07,942
Did you hear that, everybody?
Did you hear that?

1338
01:12:08,022 --> 01:12:11,502
Maybe he's not so great.
Maybe he sucks!

1339
01:12:13,102 --> 01:12:14,702
So, I guess you lose!

1340
01:12:14,942 --> 01:12:18,782
Ben, you lose the lot.
Don, you have to skip town.

1341
01:12:20,862 --> 01:12:22,542
Right, everybody?

1342
01:12:30,622 --> 01:12:34,982
You know, Paxton, I been doing
a lot of thinking these past few days.

1343
01:12:38,022 --> 01:12:39,662
About what, asshole?

1344
01:12:40,342 --> 01:12:41,502
Dreams.

1345
01:12:42,462 --> 01:12:44,542
About how we either, you know...

1346
01:12:44,622 --> 01:12:46,982
We either cherish them
or let them die on the vine.

1347
01:12:47,022 --> 01:12:48,342
What'd you want to be
when you were a kid?

1348
01:12:48,422 --> 01:12:51,062
Me, I wanted to be a ref in the WNBA.

1349
01:12:51,142 --> 01:12:53,342
You know, 'cause I like women
and I like basketball.

1350
01:12:53,422 --> 01:12:54,422
Can you get off my back?

1351
01:12:54,502 --> 01:12:56,382
- You want to do this one on your own?
- Yeah, thanks, man.

1352
01:12:56,462 --> 01:12:59,262
I get that. Okay, you guys do your thing.

1353
01:12:59,342 --> 01:13:01,262
What'd you dream about, Paxton?

1354
01:13:01,342 --> 01:13:04,742
Music. Music's been my passion
ever since I fell in love with the classics.

1355
01:13:04,822 --> 01:13:07,462
Now, when you say classics,
what do you mean?

1356
01:13:07,502 --> 01:13:11,462
Well, it's a pretty short list.
You got your 'N Sync.

1357
01:13:11,542 --> 01:13:14,462
You got your 98 Degrees,
your Boyz II Men.

1358
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:15,782
And then pretty much
the Backstreet Boys

1359
01:13:15,862 --> 01:13:18,222
came along
and revolutionized music as a whole.

1360
01:13:18,302 --> 01:13:20,022
Hello!

1361
01:13:20,102 --> 01:13:21,542
What about O-Town?

1362
01:13:21,622 --> 01:13:23,142
That was the best night of my life.

1363
01:13:23,182 --> 01:13:27,502
See, I haven't had the best night
of my life yet. Someday though, huh?

1364
01:13:27,582 --> 01:13:30,382
All personal crap aside,
I hear Big Ups is pretty damn good.

1365
01:13:30,462 --> 01:13:32,902
- Come on, who said that?
- People talk.

1366
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:36,422
- Is he doing what I think he's doing?
- No way.

1367
01:13:36,462 --> 01:13:40,742
If he moves that car,
I'll eat my own pussy.

1368
01:13:40,782 --> 01:13:42,222
Attagirl.

1369
01:13:42,302 --> 01:13:44,422
Thirty-two years in the business
and I've never seen this,

1370
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:46,502
a dealer-to-dealer lot sale.

1371
01:13:46,582 --> 01:13:48,022
This is suicide.

1372
01:13:48,102 --> 01:13:50,462
Come on, Don, stay focused.

1373
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:51,502
Let me ask you something, man.

1374
01:13:51,582 --> 01:13:53,782
You ever think about just dropping
everything and going for it?

1375
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:56,062
I'm not talking about setting up
some studio in the back of a car lot.

1376
01:13:56,142 --> 01:14:00,302
I'm talking about you, Ricky and Jason
living the life, man,

1377
01:14:00,382 --> 01:14:03,862
and putting yourselves
on the line on a daily basis.

1378
01:14:03,942 --> 01:14:05,502
Wait. What are you doing?

1379
01:14:05,582 --> 01:14:07,222
Picture this, Paxton.

1380
01:14:07,782 --> 01:14:11,542
Big Ups touring
the Florida Panhandle, right?

1381
01:14:11,622 --> 01:14:13,782
Gainesville, sold out.

1382
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:16,902
Pensacola, sold out. Right?

1383
01:14:17,302 --> 01:14:19,582
And now it's Panama Beach.

1384
01:14:19,862 --> 01:14:21,262
Lights go down,

1385
01:14:21,342 --> 01:14:23,782
and all you can hear is 7,500 girls

1386
01:14:23,862 --> 01:14:26,702
screaming at the top
of their lungs, right?

1387
01:14:26,782 --> 01:14:29,622
And the bass, it starts pumping.

1388
01:14:29,702 --> 01:14:32,422
Pump, pump, pump, pump.

1389
01:14:32,462 --> 01:14:35,742
The girls start jumping.
Jump, jump, jump.

1390
01:14:35,822 --> 01:14:40,302
Ricky and Jason, they hit the stage.
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance.

1391
01:14:40,382 --> 01:14:42,062
What happens next, Paxton?

1392
01:14:42,142 --> 01:14:43,462
I don't know. What?

1393
01:14:43,502 --> 01:14:46,822
- An engine roars to life.
- What?

1394
01:14:46,902 --> 01:14:49,702
I mean, just fucking roars!

1395
01:14:51,702 --> 01:14:53,502
Who rises from beneath the stage?

1396
01:14:53,582 --> 01:14:54,862
- Who?
- Jesus.

1397
01:14:54,942 --> 01:14:56,902
The guy with the best hair
in the business.

1398
01:14:56,982 --> 01:14:59,342
- Paxton Harding!
- Yeah.

1399
01:14:59,502 --> 01:15:01,662
- In the goddamn Bandit Car...
- What?

1400
01:15:01,742 --> 01:15:03,742
...T- top, golden eagle on the hood.

1401
01:15:03,822 --> 01:15:07,862
And the word is,
it's one of only five used in the movie.

1402
01:15:07,942 --> 01:15:11,262
And the girls, they love it.
And you want to know why?

1403
01:15:11,342 --> 01:15:12,662
Yeah. 'Cause we're good.

1404
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:14,102
You're goddamn right, you're good.

1405
01:15:14,182 --> 01:15:18,742
You, my friend,
are a full-blown rock star in that car.

1406
01:15:18,822 --> 01:15:20,982
Holy shit. He might have him.

1407
01:15:21,662 --> 01:15:24,262
I feel like I'm watching
a wonder of nature,

1408
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:28,622
like a blue whale giving birth
or a pig going down on a hyena.

1409
01:15:29,182 --> 01:15:30,862
You know, Paxton,

1410
01:15:31,382 --> 01:15:33,662
a man much wiser than myself
once said that

1411
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:37,182
most men lead lives
of quiet desperation.

1412
01:15:37,262 --> 01:15:41,182
Now, do not silence Big Ups
before the girls,

1413
01:15:41,262 --> 01:15:42,542
nay,

1414
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:46,382
the world, has heard the first verse.

1415
01:15:46,622 --> 01:15:48,702
Pump, pump.

1416
01:15:49,142 --> 01:15:50,782
Pump, pump.

1417
01:15:51,182 --> 01:15:52,862
Pump, pump.

1418
01:15:53,102 --> 01:15:54,502
How much for the Trans Am?

1419
01:15:54,542 --> 01:15:57,702
200 grand. I'll give it to you for 80.
No payments till January.

1420
01:15:57,782 --> 01:15:58,982
I'll take it!

1421
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:00,462
He did it!

1422
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:12,902
Who just got 80 grand
for that prop, huh?

1423
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:15,022
- <i>Big Ups!</i>
- <i>Big Ups!</i>

1424
01:16:15,102 --> 01:16:17,062
This is the new band car!

1425
01:16:18,302 --> 01:16:19,422
Yeah!

1426
01:16:19,502 --> 01:16:21,502
Get it down!

1427
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:25,782
Hey, Brent, we would've had a wonderful
weekend up at that cabin, huh?

1428
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:29,582
You know what?
I'm gonna fucking knock you out.

1429
01:16:30,102 --> 01:16:32,022
You already have.

1430
01:16:32,102 --> 01:16:34,862
Basically, I have to <i>carpe diem</i> here, lvy.

1431
01:16:37,382 --> 01:16:39,102
See you!

1432
01:16:40,022 --> 01:16:42,502
Well, it's official. I am single.

1433
01:16:42,622 --> 01:16:44,822
I'm sorry, lvy. I was just selling a car.

1434
01:16:44,902 --> 01:16:46,702
Are you? Are you really sorry, Don?

1435
01:16:46,782 --> 01:16:48,942
Okay, you got me, I'm not sorry.
You know what?

1436
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:51,022
Paxton and the Bandit Car
were just parked on the spot

1437
01:16:51,102 --> 01:16:53,542
where I intend to plant some roots.

1438
01:16:55,462 --> 01:16:57,062
- You hear that, team?
- What?

1439
01:16:57,182 --> 01:16:58,182
What, honey?

1440
01:16:58,222 --> 01:17:01,942
Cutting up the Hacienda Court card.
Yep. I'm settling in Temecula.

1441
01:17:02,022 --> 01:17:03,422
- Don!
- Yep.

1442
01:17:03,502 --> 01:17:05,942
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about friends and family,

1443
01:17:06,022 --> 01:17:07,542
and I decided that I can't care for them

1444
01:17:07,622 --> 01:17:10,502
as much on the road,
so I'm settling here.

1445
01:17:10,582 --> 01:17:13,222
- Speaking of family, where's Blake?
- Right here, Don.

1446
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:14,822
Come here, Son.

1447
01:17:14,862 --> 01:17:18,422
Now, your father, he can't do anything
about the past, but I'll tell you

1448
01:17:18,502 --> 01:17:21,542
I can guarantee you I will always be
there for you in the future, all right?

1449
01:17:21,622 --> 01:17:23,782
Don, I'm like a foot taller than you.

1450
01:17:24,462 --> 01:17:26,062
Hug your father.

1451
01:17:26,622 --> 01:17:28,862
Come here, Son. There we go.

1452
01:17:28,942 --> 01:17:31,382
Thanks, Dad. Daddy.

1453
01:17:31,462 --> 01:17:35,462
I love it. As far as the beautiful
lvy Selleck is concerned, she's it for me.

1454
01:17:37,222 --> 01:17:39,982
- She's the one.
- That was just a one-night stand, buddy.

1455
01:17:40,062 --> 01:17:42,222
No, no, you're my woman.
That's my son. Don't overthink it.

1456
01:17:42,342 --> 01:17:44,342
Now, if someone went
and made a beer run,

1457
01:17:44,422 --> 01:17:47,702
I think we'd have everything we need
for a goddamn kickass party.

1458
01:17:47,782 --> 01:17:50,302
DJ! Play <i>We Are Family</i>
by Sister Sledge!

1459
01:17:50,382 --> 01:17:51,302
Drop it!

1460
01:17:51,382 --> 01:17:54,982
Finally! Somebody hit the nail on
the head. That's what I'm talking about.

1461
01:17:55,022 --> 01:17:56,902
That is a perfect song.

1462
01:17:59,462 --> 01:18:00,862
What the fuck?

1463
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:06,022
I warned you over and over again
not to tell me how to do my job.

1464
01:18:06,102 --> 01:18:09,342
You brought this on yourself.
Are you happy?

1465
01:18:09,422 --> 01:18:11,782
