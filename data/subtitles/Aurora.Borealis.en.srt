1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,471
- This is complete madness.
- Well... so what?

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,399
I'm not going to have a
single penny until springtime.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,594
But Mercedes, they say it's worth it.
You should see it, once in your life...

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,830
- It's unforgettable, amazing...
- And cold and expensive...

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,792
Oh fuck, it's cold.

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,757
- Are you sure it's here?
- Yes.

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,991
It doesn't look like it's open.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,034
They said at the Tourist Office
that it would be fine for the weekend.

10
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,518
- See anything?
- No.

11
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,598
It looks like
it's going to snow again.

12
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,390
Can you tell me once more
what they are again?

13
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,559
Thney are magnetic particles
in the atmosphnere.

14
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,397
- Will you wake me up at 4?
- Sure.

15
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,358
Once in a lifetime...

16
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,113
- Ouch, it's burning!
- Don't be stupid. Catch!

17
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,433
- Did you ask them?
- No.

18
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,595
But they are
from there aren't they?

19
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,512
Ask them yourself!

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,752
No,
I'm no good at languages.

21
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,674
Smile!

22
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,909
Go away, clouds!

23
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,358
Who are you Writing to?

24
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,959
Antonio.

25
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,515
Didn't he dump you?

26
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,871
Can I read it?

27
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,757
Okay, here.

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,238
We are in the asshole of nowhere,
far north of the polar circle.

29
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,797
We get up at daWn,
have breakkfast until dark, -

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,309
- it's a matter of a few hnours.

31
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,193
The night lasts for more
than twenty hours -

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,358
- but you can't even
go out for a feW drinks, -

33
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,109
- because the prices
are astronomical hnere.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,039
No wonder the Norwegians have
the world record in suicides.

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,156
We haven't seen any
polar bears or reindeers.

36
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,475
Mercedes sends her regards.
A big kiss. Ana.

37
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,640
- Do you think she's his wife?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,673
Look at that hat,
stylish or what?

39
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,597
Didn't you ask them?

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,228
No.

41
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,672
Mercedes! Do We have to
listen to thnat music?

42
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,396
Gimme a break!

43
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,396
Have faith! What if there
is a saint for thne northern lights?

44
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,991
No saints that far north, they don't
believe in those things here.

45
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,436
Listen Ana, you have dragged
me all the Way up here -

46
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,110
- promising me the fireWorks
of the sky, and We've only seen -

47
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,153
- streetlights and snow.

48
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,272
You came of your own free will.

49
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,917
- I'll Wake you up at four!
- Good night.

50
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,396
Look Ana!
The sky is clearing up.

51
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,469
Look at all those stars.

52
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,478
That's Orion. Let's go outside.

53
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,074
A shooting star!
Wish for somethning!

54
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,078
- Where?
- There over the mountain.

55
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,077
It's a satellite, it's orbiting.

56
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,272
What are they doing?

57
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,232
The satellites?

58
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,590
They carry soaps, -

59
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,996
- commercials for shampoo, -

60
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,516
- telephone conversations, -

61
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,394
- the last episode of Friends.

62
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,992
The dreams of the world.

63
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,670
But then they also
carry military secrets, -

64
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,471
- emergency signals, -

65
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,277
- women calling
to scold their husbands, -

66
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,074
- bad Weather forecasts.

67
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,910
The nightmares of the world.

68
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,676
- That's a shooting star.
- Yes.

69
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,835
Now you can
wish for something!

70
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,749
One...

71
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,549
Two...

72
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,354
Three...

73
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,758
To see the northern lights.

74
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,676
Nothing is happening.

75
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,991
Maybe you should wish
for something else.

76
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,436
- And you?
- Me?

77
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,876
A guy With the sexiest body
in the World!

78
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,871
But we have to
prebook the hotel!

79
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,398
Do you remember Lanzarote.
The dirty place we were staying in!

80
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,079
Are you going to stay
there all day? They'll get cold.

81
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,158
Tell them to
come in for supper.

82
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,833
Ragna wants to know if
you'd like some supper.

83
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,314
I'm glad
Anton isn't at sea.

84
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,874
Once in a lifetime...

85
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,790
Forget about that,
you can't expect so much from life.

86
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,197
- Come on, let's forget it?
- One, two, three?

87
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,437
Yeah.
But with concentration.

88
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,675
One.

89
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,915
Two.

90
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,712
Three.

91
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,278
- Anton...
- Yeah, what is it?

92
