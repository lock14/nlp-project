<i>[Man]
The night of the day he died,</i>

3
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:46,610
<i>without any preliminary decision,</i>

4
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:50,481
<i>almost, uh, unconsciously,</i>

5
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,179
<i>I went straight to his diary.</i>

6
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:11,894
<i>[Michael York As Isherwood]
That spring I realized
that I had fallen deeply in love...</i>

7
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:15,636
<i>with a boy whom I'd known
for only a short while--</i>

8
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,235
<i>Don Bachardy.</i>

9
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:22,874
<i>The 30-year difference in our ages
shocked some of those who knew us.</i>

10
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,851
<i>I, myself, didn't feel guilty about this,</i>

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,617
<i>but I did feel awed by the emotional
intensity of our relationship...</i>

12
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,681
<i>right from the beginning.</i>

13
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,321
<i>The strange sense
of a fated, mutual discovery.</i>

14
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:41,460
<i>I knew that this time
I had really committed myself.</i>

15
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:45,198
<i>Don might leave me,
but I couldn't possibly leave him...</i>

16
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,265
<i>unless he ceased to need me.</i>

17
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:51,573
<i>This sense of responsibility,
which was almost fatherly,</i>

18
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:56,174
<i>made me anxious but full of joy.</i>

19
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,424
And Chris knew exactly
what to do with me. Yes.

20
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:16,794
His role could be described...

21
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,999
as that of the arch villain.

22
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:24,977
He took this young boy,
and he warped him to his mold.

23
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,609
<i>He taught him
all kinds of wicked things.</i>

24
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:35,079
It was exactly
what the boy wanted,

25
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:38,648
and, um, he flourished.

26
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:50,565
Well, I mean, the idea
of this middle-aged man,

27
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:54,267
um, deflowering this young boy.

28
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,910
<i>And also what Chris was doing
to his own reputation.</i>

29
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:03,941
<i>I don't even think
that a lot of queers...</i>

30
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,454
<i>would have considered me
ripe enough yet.</i>

31
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,649
Chris told me
I was very sophisticated for my age.

32
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:14,092
And, of course,
that just enchanted me.

33
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:55,195
Chris was against
having an animal, a pet.

34
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,262
And his reason was...

35
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:03,743
that he felt that
when two people live together...

36
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,746
<i>who had an animal,</i>

37
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:12,081
<i>an awful lot of affection would
be siphoned off by that animal,</i>

38
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:15,645
<i>which otherwise would go
between the two people.</i>

39
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,714
And, of course,
he was absolutely right.

40
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:24,260
<i>The, uh, result was that
we became each other's animals.</i>

41
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,767
<i>I became the cat,
and Chris was an old horse,</i>

42
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,531
<i>an old dobbin.</i>

43
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:34,439
<i>On birthday cards,</i>

44
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:39,070
<i>he would always do
a little drawing of a dobbin...</i>

45
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,843
<i>in some act of homage to Kitty.</i>

46
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,911
<i>Kitty often rode the old dobbin.</i>

47
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:54,292
<i>We devised stories
about Kitty and Dobbin.</i>

48
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:58,058
<i>And they had all kinds of adventures,</i>

49
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,896
<i>which, uh, were just--</i>

50
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,028
<i>[Chuckles]
full of symbolic meaning.</i>

51
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:18,316
This is Chris's workroom,

52
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,751
where I've been sleeping for,

53
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:25,155
oh, eight
or nine months now.

54
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:29,663
And, uh, I moved
his day bed into the corner...

55
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,891
<i>under the windows.</i>

56
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:37,598
<i>At night I can lie down
and look up at the stars in the sky,</i>

57
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,233
and also I see the full moon
coming through the other window...

58
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,800
around 2:00 or 3:00
in the morning.

59
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,417
<i>The Hockney print,</i>

60
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:06,489
<i>which is a variation
on the painting he did of the two of us.</i>

61
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:11,266
<i>In the painting,
Chris is on the right in profile.</i>

62
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:17,503
<i>Here he is full-faced in the chair
that I'm sitting in in the painting.</i>

63
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,348
<i>And that was a piece
of Indian corn...</i>

64
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:27,217
<i>that Elsa Lanchester gave Chris.</i>

65
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:32,954
<i>They're no longer there, because we once
had a rat living in the house.</i>

66
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:38,021
<i>To force him out,
we locked up all the food cupboards,</i>

67
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:42,831
<i>and he was so desperate one night,
he ate the kernels.</i>

68
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,361
He cleaned almost entirely both cobs.

69
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,466
<i>And this is ancient corn.</i>

70
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,671
<i>It had to be
something like 50 years old.</i>

71
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:57,774
Imagine being so hungry.
[Laughing]

72
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,649
And finally we drove him out.

73
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:04,851
We didn't want to catch him in a trap,
but we did drive him out.

74
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:09,157
There was nothing left to eat.
[Chuckling]

75
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,298
<i>And these are watercolors...</i>

76
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,598
<i>by Chris's father.</i>

77
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,934
This one down here too.

78
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:22,965
This was by a professional
painter of houses in England.

79
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,876
And this is of the house
that Chris was born in--

80
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,436
<i>Wyberslegh Hall.<i></i>

81
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,462
<i>Chris was born in Cheshire, England...</i>

82
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,898
<i>to an upper-class family in 1904..</i>

83
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:57,210
<i>His mother, Kathleen,
was a dominant figure in his life.</i>

84
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:01,840
<i>And he often spoke more fondly
of his nanny than he did of her.</i>

85
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,449
He and Kathleen were adversaries.

86
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,186
They couldn't help but be,
because Kathleen had very clear ideas...

87
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,695
what she wanted,
what she expected of Chris.

88
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:21,429
She wanted him to be a don--
a teacher-- and, uh--

89
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,733
and that wasn't
his intention at all.

90
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,071
<i>His father, Frank, was an officer
in the British army.</i>

91
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:34,979
<i>And he was killed
in the First World War...</i>

92
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,576
<i>when Chris was just a young boy.</i>

93
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:51,288
<i>He later received a scholarship
to study history at Cambridge.</i>

94
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,356
<i>But Chris was rebellious...</i>

95
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:57,768
<i>and felt manipulated by the way
history was being taught at Cambridge.</i>

96
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,167
<i>[Woman]
He did fine in his first year exams,</i>

97
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,733
<i>and then in the second year,</i>

98
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:08,304
<i>he deliberately wrote joke answers.</i>

99
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:12,819
Wrote about the decoration of
the examining rooms, mocked the examiners.

100
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,014
And shortly after wards,
he was called back to school from London,

101
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,320
where he'd gone
for the summer holidays.

102
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:23,193
<i>And got expelled,
because he wanted to be,</i>

103
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,858
and I think because he wanted
to disappoint Kathleen...

104
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:29,129
and make it perfectly clear...

105
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:32,639
that he wasn't going to do her bidding.

106
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:36,506
Isherwood was searching for a place
where he could live...

107
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:40,206
and explore, I think,
among other things, his sexuality.

108
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,680
He was beginning to realize
that he was gay.

109
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:48,345
<i>England was a place
of confinement and strictures...</i>

110
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,859
<i>that made it hard
fora gay man to pursue that life,</i>

111
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:58,159
<i>if not openly, at least in a satisfying
and complete kind of way.</i>

112
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,002
Also his very good friend, W. H. Auden,

113
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:11,033
<i>one of the foremost poets
of the 20th century, had gone to Berlin.</i>

114
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:16,845
<i>He was writing letters back to Isherwood,
urging him to come to Berlin.</i>

115
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,590
<i>[Isherwood]
I was looking for a sort of homeland,</i>

116
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:33,429
<i>for somewhere where I could function
in a way where I would feel freer...</i>

117
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,230
<i>than I felt in England
at that particular time...</i>

118
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,567
<i>under the particular circumstances
I was living in.</i>

119
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,931
<i>I think it was partly a class thing,</i>

120
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,172
<i>but, of course, it was inextricably
mixed up with my homosexuality,</i>

121
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,236
because, um,

122
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:51,444
what I in fact started to encounter...

123
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,544
was the German working class.

124
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,055
<i>[York]
To Christopher, Berlin meant boys.</i>

125
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,458
<i>At school, Christopher
had fallen in love with many boys...</i>

126
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,800
<i>and been yearningly romantic
about them.</i>

127
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:16,866
<i>At college, he had at last managed
to get into bed with one of them.</i>

128
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:19,105
<i>Others experiences followed,</i>

129
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:23,673
<i>all of them enjoyable,
but none entirely satisfying.</i>

130
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,981
<i>This was because Christopher
was suffering from an inhibition...</i>

131
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:30,490
<i>then not unusual
among upper-class homosexuals.</i>

132
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:34,755
<i>He couldn't relax sexually
with a member of his own class or nation.</i>

133
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,197
<i>He needed a working-class foreigner.</i>

134
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:46,367
Isherwood just happened to be
at one of the most important spots to be in...

135
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,431
in the 20th century.

136
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,275
And that was in Germany
in the late 1920s, the early 1930s.

137
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:56,783
<i>This was the place
in which Nazism was developing,</i>

138
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,841
<i>emerging as an important force.</i>

139
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,979
<i>This was where Hitler's Germany
was on the rise.</i>

140
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,120
<i>[Bachardy]
Chris was observing everything
that was going on there...</i>

141
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,185
<i>and formulating ideas...</i>

142
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:13,791
<i>that would later go
into his two books about Berlin--</i>

143
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:18,600
<i>one a novel
and the other a collection of stories--</i>

144
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,641
<i>that really put him on the map
as an author.</i>

145
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:28,306
<i>The success ofthose two books
led to a play,</i> I Am a Camera,

146
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:32,910
<i>and a movie of the play
and eventually</i> Cabaret,

147
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:36,217
which was quite
a success on Broadway,

148
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,852
and then, of course,
the movie version with Liza Minnelli.

149
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:46,560
<i>Ladies</i> und <i>Gents,
fraulein Sally Bowles!</i>

150
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:55,136
Isherwood did not love
the way the movie was done.

151
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,574
He thought
Liza Minnelli was too good.

152
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,112
He made a funny comment
in interviews about, if--

153
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,013
if she opens her mouth
and she's every bit Judy Garland's daughter...

154
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,816
<i>and that there's no way a club in Berlin
could have housed such a talent.</i>

155
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,514
♪ Life is a cabaret ♪

156
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:15,619
<i>[Bachardy]
Five minutes after
Liza Minnelli had been on screen,</i>

157
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:21,293
<i>Chris leaned towards me and said,
"She's no good. "[Laughs]</i>

158
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,166
That's him.
[Laughing Continues]

159
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:29,174
He liked Michael York very much.
He thought he was just right for it.

160
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,268
But how could he like Liza Minnelli?

161
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:35,110
Because, um--

162
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,980
with her personality and talent,

163
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,919
she destroyed
the character of Sally Bowles.

164
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:47,621
Because if Sally Bowles isn't an amateur,
she isn't Sally Bowles.

165
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:53,394
<i>I think Christopher Isherwood
enjoyed the film. I think he would say,</i>

166
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,526
"Well, that's not what it was like."

167
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,536
But it was a point of view.

168
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:02,405
And when you write a piece,
you have to be prepared
for all kinds of points of view.

169
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:06,003
And, um, he liked
that people liked it so much.

170
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,539
<i>[Hodson]
Cabaret put him on the map
for the world at large,</i>

171
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,949
<i>for the general public.</i>

172
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,047
People who didn't read much
or may not have known
about Isherwood as an author--

173
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:19,319
<i>Cabaret</i> was really the ticket to fame.</i>

174
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,384
[Train Whistle Toots]

175
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:28,428
<i>Isherwood had to leave Berlin in 1933,
as so many people did.</i>

176
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:33,769
<i>And throughout the 1930s,
he'd wandered in Europe,</i>

177
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,934
<i>looking for a country
where he could settle...</i>

178
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,138
<i>with his German boyfriend,
Heinz Neddermeyer.</i>

179
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,810
<i>There were problems
about passports, papers, visas.</i>

180
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:49,845
<i>Heinz eventually was arrested
by the Gestapo...</i>

181
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:53,484
<i>and first served a prison sentence
and then went into the army.</i>

182
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,597
<i>This was very distressing.
This was a boy to whom, at the time,
he felt very committed.</i>

183
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,503
<i>[Hodson]
I think for both Isherwood and Auden,</i>

184
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:19,814
<i>they could see that there was
a war on the horizon in Europe,
without any doubt at all.</i>

185
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:23,822
And they recognized that they had no part
in that, because they were pacifists.

186
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:28,087
<i>So he and Auden turned
their backs on Europe.</i>

187
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,289
<i>They decided to emigrate
to the United States.</i>

188
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:36,996
<i>And they arrived in New York City
in January, 1939.</i>

189
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:47,246
<i>[Bachardy]
Chris didn't like the cold.
He didn't like the grime of New York.</i>

190
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:51,717
He didn't like the bustle,
and he longed for the West.

191
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,715
<i>He had a romantic vision of the West,</i>

192
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,022
<i>which he got from John Ford movies.</i>

193
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,790
<i>[Hodson]
So he headed out across country...</i>

194
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:07,231
<i>and ended up in Southern California.</i>

195
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:20,442
<i>Los Angeles offered a tremendously
varied cultural atmosphere...</i>

196
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:24,382
<i>for someone like Isherwood
to drop into the center.</i>

197
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,919
<i>There were the expatriates,</i>

198
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:31,321
<i>the artists, the musicians,
the actors, the directors--</i>

199
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,382
<i>a great boiling pot...</i>

200
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,557
<i>for all sorts of cultural
and artistic life and creativity.</i>

201
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:41,123
<i>He fit in beautifully.</i>

202
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:45,069
<i>Because he had something to offer,
they had something to offer him.</i>

203
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,698
He's one of the few writers
who will admit...

204
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,073
that writing for Hollywood
made him a better writer.

205
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:55,638
<i>He learned an economy of  language.
He learned how to use dialogue,</i>

206
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,650
<i>how to set something up visually
in a paragraph...</i>

207
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,653
<i>rather than in pages and pages.</i>

208
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,712
When he abandoned England...

209
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,351
and came to this place
where there were no rules,

210
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:12,763
<i>he also abandoned
the methodology...</i>

211
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:18,362
<i>and structures and styles
of traditional novel writing.</i>

212
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,067
<i>He wrote with this camera eye,
if you like,</i>

213
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,167
<i>influenced by the cinema.</i>

214
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:36,284
<i>[York As Isherwood]
I am a camera with its shutter open,</i>

215
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,883
<i>quite passive,
recording, not thinking.</i>

216
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,461
<i>Someday, all this will
have to be developed,</i>

217
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,729
<i>carefully printed, fixed.</i>

218
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,577
Pulling up roots from England,
coming to this country,

219
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,705
was an outward manifestation...

220
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:05,342
<i>of a spiritual crisis in his life.</i>

221
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,816
<i>The impending war
was getting him down,</i>

222
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:15,351
<i>and he really was in need
of some kind of guidance.</i>

223
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,900
And he certainly couldn't have got it
from the Church of England,

224
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:25,267
because he'd learned to, uh, loathe...

225
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:28,000
all that official religion in England.

226
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,000
<i>[Man]
He met Aldous Huxley,</i>

227
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,342
<i>who in turn introduced him
to Swami Prabhavananda,</i>

228
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,645
who had started the Vedanta Society
in Southern California.

229
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:41,483
And Isherwood studied Vedanta,
a branch of Hindu philosophy,

230
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:45,217
with Prabhavananda,
for the rest of his life, really.

231
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:50,588
Chris immediately told him
he was homosexual,

232
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:53,224
<i>and Prabhavananda didn't regard that...</i>

233
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,701
<i>as an insurmountable obstacle.</i>

234
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:02,700
<i>He became such a devout follower
of Vedanta and of the Swami...</i>

235
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,801
that he did seriously
consider becoming a monk.

236
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:08,245
<i>But there were two things
that stopped him.</i>

237
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,807
<i>He recognized in himself
that he wanted to have...</i>

238
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:17,050
a longtime personal commitment
to a serious relationship with a partner.

239
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:21,150
<i>The second thing he knew
is that he needed to continue writing,</i>

240
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,252
<i>that he could not give that up.</i>

241
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:26,585
Um, these are
my mother's own scrapbooks.

242
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,650
Um--

243
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,858
Joan Bennett, um--

244
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,733
<i>I think this is Nancy Carroll.</i>

245
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:41,035
Oh, Louise Brooks.
She had Louise Brooks here.

246
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,206
<i>Look at the trouble.
It's beautifully done.</i>

247
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:51,148
<i>How carefully all these things
are put in.</i>

248
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,084
<i>Imagine cutting out that so carefully.</i>

249
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:59,417
<i>I must get my orderliness
from my mother.</i>

250
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,361
<i>My parents were attracted
to the glamour of Hollywood,</i>

251
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:14,931
<i>especially my mother,
who loved movies and movie stars.</i>

252
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:21,874
<i>So as soon as they were married,
they traveled across country by car...</i>

253
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,917
<i>and settled in Los Angeles.</i>

254
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:28,442
<i>And soon my mother gave birth
to my brother Ted.</i>

255
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:33,083
<i>I was born four years later in 1934..</i>

256
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,726
<i>It was during World War II
when we were growing up,</i>

257
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,237
<i>and there was a big demand
on my father to work long hours,</i>

258
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,936
<i>because he worked
in the aerospace industry.</i>

259
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,413
<i>So while my father
was working overtime,</i>

260
00:21:55,482 --> 00:22:01,045
<i>my mother would take Ted and me
downtown by streetcar to the movies.</i>

261
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:40,022
This is one of the key theaters
I remember.

262
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:43,722
I think it's the first one
I remember being brought to--

263
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:47,630
to see a Joan Crawford movie
called <i>My Shining Hour</i>.

264
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,998
Um, I was four.

265
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:59,941
<i>[Man]
His mother would take his brother
out of school even,</i>

266
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:02,948
<i>and they would go to movies
during the day.</i>

267
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:06,247
<i>Then Don would even go on his own.
When he was--</i>

268
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,378
When he was very young, he would go.

269
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:10,445
He wasn't old enough
to actually get a ticket,

270
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:14,152
<i>and he would get someone to buy the ticket
for him to get into the theater.</i>

271
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:19,790
<i>At the theater, he was looking up close
at these big images of these movie stars.</i>

272
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:38,474
[Laughing]

273
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:41,884
<i>[Bachardy]
We started as ordinary fans,</i>

274

<i>sitting in the bleachers
outside the theater with our mother.</i>

275
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:50,290
<i>And eventually,
Ted and I had the idea--</i>

276
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,388
<i>when going to a premiere--</i>

277
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:57,425
<i>to put on our best jacket
and trousers and ties...</i>

278
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:00,700
<i>and try to look as though
we belonged there.</i>

279
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,210
<i>And we also brought our camera with us,</i>

280
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:17,917
<i>and we started taking pictures
of ourselves with the movie stars.</i>

281
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,774
<i>[Woman]
I met Don Bachardy all by himself.</i>

282

Round cheeks and bright eyes.

283
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:47,981
And he was one of those young kids
who would ask you to sign an autograph,

284
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:52,787
come next to you and--while you sign--
and his friend would take the picture.

285
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,956
<i>And years and years later, he found
the photograph and gave me a copy of it,</i>

286
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:00,659
<i>which is wonderful.</i>

287
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:19,141
<i>[Bachardy]
Ted and I went to the beach every weekend.</i>

<i>Ted mysteriously at first...</i>

289
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:27,548
<i>always wanted to walk us
about a mile and a half...</i>

290

<i>to Will Rogers State Beach...</i>

291
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:33,964
<i>for us to lay out our beach blanket.</i>

292
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:41,940
<i>I soon discovered that that was because
it was the queer beach in Santa Monica.</i>

293
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:50,204
<i>This is more or less the area of the beach...</i>

294
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:52,774
where I met Chris,

295
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:57,880
and that would have been
when I was probably 16.

296
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,685
<i>He was so friendly.</i>

297
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:08,860
<i>He had such a charming smile
and sparkling eyes.</i>

298
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,426
Eyes that had such energy.

299
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:14,064
Eyes that ate you up.

<i>Sometimes Chris and I would just
wave to each other in the distance.</i>

301
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:26,543
<i>And sometimes he would
come up to our blanket...</i>

302
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:30,248
<i>and engage us in conversation.</i>

303
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:35,260
<i>A t that time, I was only interested
in actors and actresses.</i>

304
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:39,662
<i>Writers were
an unknown quantity to me.</i>

305
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:43,995
<i>So I wasn't impressed by Chris as a writer.</i>

306
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,531
<i>And at the time, he was really
only interested in my brother Ted.</i>

307
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:52,271
<i>I knew they had slept together
a couple of times.</i>

<i>The first time I can say
that I met Chris socially...</i>

310

<i>was in October of 1952
when I was 18.</i>

311

Ted and I
were invited for drinks...

312

by a couple of, uh,
queer men we knew.

313
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:24,738
<i>And they'd had Chris for dinner.</i>

314
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:31,243
<i>And I think Ted and I
were invited for dessert.

315
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:36,481
Dessert for them and for Chris.

316
00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:46,157
<i>It was one of the first times
that I got drunk,</i>

317
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:50,293
<i>and I was very unused to drinking
and had too much to drink.</i>

318
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,805
<i>And Chris had been there
since before dinner,</i>

319
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:57,400
<i>so he was fairly drunk too.</i>

320
00:27:57,477 --> 00:28:01,811
<i>And we found ourselves standing up
in the dining room, kissing.</i>

321
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:09,009
<i>We lost our balance
and fell against a big window,</i>

322

<i>which was all panes of glass--
[Glass Breaking]</i>

323

<i>and we broke one of the glass panes.</i>

<i>That sound of glass breaking
brought me out of my alcoholic haze,</i>

<i>at the Redfern Gallery.</i>

666

This was my official introduction...

667
00:56:57,381 --> 00:57:00,373
to my identity as an artist.

668

<i>Don was interviewed
and photographed by the press,</i>

670
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:15,823
<i>while I kept away in a corner,
nearly splitting with pride.</i>

671
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:23,773
<i>I put on a rather disparaging expression,
like a parent who fears to show his pride.</i>

672
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:29,235
<i>Of course, I know it's the most
monstrous egotism on my part to be proud,</i>

673
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:32,976
<i>to claim any part
of what he has made of himself.</i>

674

<i>Just the same, I do.</i>

675
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:41,750
<i>[Bachardy]
He often said he'd never been denied...</i>

676
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:45,887
<i>any of the pleasures
and satisfactions of a parent,</i>

677
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,897
<i>because he'd met me...</i>

678
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,798

that he could still have...

679
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:54,463
an enormous influence on my development,

680
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:58,304

a crowning achievement.

682
00:58:06,017 --> 00:58:08,076
Yeah, I'm flexible,

683
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:11,144
<i>I had finally
established myself as an artist.</i>

684
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:17,058
<i>I had my own persona, as it were,
and I could function independently.</i>

685
00:58:17,128 --> 00:58:21,224
<i>The question was,
did I want to go on with the old life--</i>

686
00:58:21,299 --> 00:58:23,267
<i>which had brought me to this point--</i>

687
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:26,633
<i>or did I want to go on to fresher fields?</i>

688
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:35,237
<i>The thought crossed my mind
that I might think of leaving Chris.</i>

689

All kinds of very real problems

690
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:49,956

<i>of being deprived

<i>because of my life with Chris--</i>

<i>my life with somebody
so much older than myself--</i>

697
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,982
<i>[Meows]
I could voice it in terms
of a poor little kitten...</i>

698

<i>struggling against
insurmountable odds,</i>

699
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:20,121
<i>and how brave that little cat was,</i>

<i>and how dear and deep his love...</i>

701
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:26,559
<i>that, despite everything
that he was giving up,</i>

702
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,565
<i>he could still take care
of that old horse.</i>

703
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:38,604
<i>Chris had been open with me
about his past--</i>

704
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:43,409
<i>all his lovers,
all his adventures.</i>

705
00:59:43,481 --> 00:59:46,211
<i>I took the obvious position:</i>

01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:15,150
<i>Even the homophobes could usually
bring themselves to be polite to Chris,</i>

808
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:18,194
<i>because they knew
he was a distinguished writer.</i>

809
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:23,222
<i>But who was I? I was just this little
upstart faggot from their point of view.</i>

810
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,168
<i>[Freeman]
They were friends
with Anthony Perkins, the star of Psycho,</i>

811
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:29,364
<i>who wrestled and struggled
with his sexuality all his life...</i>

812
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,999
<i>and who, of course,
died of AIDS complications.</i>

813
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:34,066
<i>He would come
to Chris and Don's house,</i>

814
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:37,375
having just spent the entire day in therapy
trying to not be gay.

815
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,177
And I think they looked upon that
with much sadness,

816
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,275
because they were
so comfortable in their lives.

817
01:08:42,352 --> 01:08:47,016
<i>Christopher never took a woman
with him to a function
so that it would appear he was straight.</i>

818
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:51,117
<i>Don never did.
They went to parties together.
They went as a couple,</i>

819
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:55,597
<i>and there would be men
that they had had sex with
in the room with their wives.</i>

820
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:16,952
<i>[Bucknell]
Part of Isherwood's
whole endeavor as a novelist...</i>

821
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:21,457
involved emerging from the "closet,"
for want of a better word.

822
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:25,393
<i>There are obviously
some homosexual characters
in his early books,</i>

823
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:31,298
<i>but there's always a kind
of covertness and a coded quality
to how he talks about it.</i>

824
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:34,236
For example, in The Berlin Stories,

825
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:36,534
if you read it very, very carefully,

826
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:41,134
you can pretty much guess
that the narrator, the protagonist, is gay.

827
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:45,910
<i>But you don't know that.
It's not a big thing in the story.</i>

828
01:09:45,983 --> 01:09:49,578
<i>And as Isherwood remarked later on,
he didn't dare make it a big thing,</i>

829
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:52,520
<i>because if he had,
it would have been the whole story.</i>

830
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:58,050
I t was very i mportant that this observer
should have been rather sexless--

831
01:09:58,128 --> 01:10:01,188
at least how it seemed
to me at that time:

832
01:10:01,264 --> 01:10:04,927
rather unobtrusive,

833
01:10:05,002 --> 01:10:08,631
just a kind of a straight man to take--
I mean no pun here--

834
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:13,802
a straight man to take the-- to pick up
the other people's jokes, you know?

835
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:18,507
Later he told that story--
the story of a gay man in Berlin,
openly gay--

836
01:10:18,582 --> 01:10:20,880
he told that story
in Christopher and His Kind.

837
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:30,659
<i>[Isherwood]
"Christopher had taken longer than Wystan...</i>

838
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,696
<i>"to become aware
of his own change of attitude...</i>

839
01:10:33,764 --> 01:10:37,666
<i>"because he was embarrassed

840
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,793
<i>"his homosexuality.</i>

841
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:43,773
<i>"As a homosexual, he had been wavering...</i>

842
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,900
<i>"between embarrassment and defiance.</i>

843
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:50,174
<i>"He became embarrassed

844
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:54,240
<i>"a selfish demand

845
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:57,582
<i>"at a time

846
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:01,190
<i>"And he became defiant...</i>

847
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:03,920
<i>"when he made the treatment

848
01:11:03,994 --> 01:11:08,328
<i>"a test by which every political party

849
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:10,389
<i>"must be judged.</i>

850
01:11:14,337 --> 01:11:18,398
<i>"He must never again
give way to embarrassment,</i>

851
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:20,773
<i>"never deny the rights ofhis tribe,</i>

852
01:11:20,844 --> 01:11:24,177
<i>"never apologize for its existence,</i>

853
01:11:25,182 --> 01:11:29,084
<i>"never think of sacrificing himself
masochistically...</i>

854
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:33,020
<i>"on the altar of that false god
of the proletarians:</i>

855
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:36,389
<i>"the greatest good

856
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:39,327
<i>"whose priests are alone empowered...</i>

01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:42,923
<i>to decide what "good' is. "</i>

858
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:49,196
<i>[Bucknell]</i>
Christopher and His Kind <i>sold faster
than any book he ever published.</i>

859
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:53,971
<i>And when he went to this--
I think it was the Oscar Wilde Bookshop
in the Village to sign copies--</i>

860
01:11:54,044 --> 01:11:56,706
and he saw young men lined up
around the block...

861
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:00,011
<i>wanting to meet him
and have him sign their copy.</i>

862
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:02,881
<i>And he was absolutely thrilled about that.</i>

863
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:21,836
<i>[Bachardy]
I stopped driving
because I had my license taken away.</i>

864
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:29,408
<i>I was considered responsible
for an accident I was in...</i>

865
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:32,346
<i>in which nobody was hurt.</i>

866
01:12:32,415 --> 01:12:36,749
<i>My revenge was to give up driving.</i>

867
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:41,120
<i>I ride my bike everywhere,
all over Santa Monica.</i>

868
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:46,993
<i>I ride it into Beverly Hills.
I had lunch just last week in Beverly Hills.</i>

869
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:50,931
<i>And it was fun,
and I got good exercise.</i>

870
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:13,453
Well, now, here's this letter
from Oliver.

871
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:16,515
He wants us to go to this party.
What will we do about it?

872
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:20,620
[Bachardy] Well, do you want to go or not?
Well, he says we have to go
in armor, you know,

873
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:23,393
and mine's terribly rusted
to start off with.

874
01:13:23,466 --> 01:13:27,061
<i>[Bachardy]
From 1968 until the late '70s,</i>

875
01:13:27,137 --> 01:13:31,972
<i>we collaborated
and wrote six or seven scripts together.</i>

876
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:40,110
Uh, <i>Dr. Frankenstein</i>.</i>

877
01:13:40,183 --> 01:13:45,678
It's the only one of the screenplays
we wrote together that got produced.

878
01:13:47,357 --> 01:13:53,227
I still have such clear memories
of working on it.

879
01:13:53,296 --> 01:13:55,389
Chris made it such fun.

880
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:00,426
<i>We were very pleased with our idea,</i>

881
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:03,597
<i>which nobody else had thought of--</i>

882
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,664
<i>of the creature as being created...</i>

883
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:10,702
<i>and being such a success--
that he was a beautiful young man.</i>

884
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:15,674
You are beautiful.

885
01:14:17,454 --> 01:14:19,388
Beautiful.

886
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:22,857
<i>[Bachardy]
Eventually, the creature deteriorates...</i>

887
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:27,226
<i>and becomes scary-looking.</i>

888
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:30,630
<i>- [Hisses]
- And it's much more poignant,</i>

889
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:35,899
because he started out beautiful,
and then loses his beauty,

890
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:40,136
and like all of us, minds it terribly.

891
01:14:48,018 --> 01:14:53,388
These three, four, five drawers
are all pictures of Chris.

892
01:14:56,226 --> 01:14:59,525
Oh, these are-- are some nudes.

893
01:15:01,464 --> 01:15:05,195
This is end of June, uh--

894
01:15:05,268 --> 01:15:08,965
uh, '85.

895
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:26,485
Wow. Um--

896
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:31,516
Yes, they bring back
those days...

897
01:15:31,594 --> 01:15:36,031
and very much his mood...

898
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:39,330
and what it was like
being with him.

899
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:50,072
<i>[York As Isherwood]
I look at my body with its wrinkles
and slackness of the skin...</i>

900
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:54,549
<i>and other imperfections
which can never be set right anymore now.</i>

901
01:15:55,552 --> 01:15:58,214
<i>It is wearing out, tiring,</i>

902
01:15:58,288 --> 01:16:02,315
<i>getting ready,
whether it likes it or not, to die.</i>

903
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:06,760
<i>I am getting ready to die.</i>

904
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:12,792
<i>All very well to say I'm not my body
and even believe this.</i>

905
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:16,202
<i>Still, it is a parting.</i>

906
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:19,400
<i>All very well to say that my whole life
has been dying...</i>

907
01:16:19,476 --> 01:16:22,309
<i>and saying good-bye to the past.</i>

908
01:16:22,379 --> 01:16:24,472
<i>This will be different.</i>

909
01:16:24,547 --> 01:16:29,985
<i>Even if it is quite painless,
it will be different.</i>

910
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:34,319
<i>And there is saying good-bye to Don.</i>

911
01:16:34,391 --> 01:16:38,487
<i>Nobody who has ever loved anyone
as I love Don...</i>

912
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:44,227
<i>can seriously pretend that--
that it won't be painful.</i>

913
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,461
<i>[Bachardy]
Oh, in 1981,</i>

914
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:55,341
<i>they discovered cancer
in his prostate.</i>

915
01:16:55,412 --> 01:17:01,282
<i>It was helpful to me
to have a pretty good four years...</i>

916
01:17:01,351 --> 01:17:07,017
<i>to accustom myself
to the idea of losing him.</i>

917
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:11,527
<i>But no matter how much preparation
one thinks one has...</i>

918
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:15,121
<i>about losing a loved one,</i>

919
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:18,133
you can't real ly be prepared.

920
01:17:19,202 --> 01:17:22,262
<i>[Caron]
About a year before Chris died,</i>

921
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:25,239
<i>some close friends called me and said,</i>

922
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:28,471
<i>"Leslie, if you want to see Chris a last time,
you better come quickly.</i>

923
01:17:28,545 --> 01:17:30,479
<i>He's very ill. "</i>

924
01:17:30,547 --> 01:17:33,948
So we had this dinner
i n a Japanese restaurant.

925
01:17:34,017 --> 01:17:38,477
And I found Chris rosy, plump,

926
01:17:38,555 --> 01:17:41,649
just absolutely--

927
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:45,091
<i>the expression, "in the pink. "</i>

928
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:48,028
<i>And I said to him,
"Chris, I was told you were near death.</i>

929
01:17:48,097 --> 01:17:53,433
<i>Look at you. You look fantastic,
and you're so full of pep. "</i>

930
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:58,270
And he said, "Oh, well, I know.

931
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,468
"I was in a very bad way,

932
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:05,947
<i>but I decided
it wasn't the right time. "</i>

933
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,949
<i>And I said, "Why?</i>

934
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,986
You hadn't finished a book?"

935
01:18:11,054 --> 01:18:15,855
And he said, "No, it's"--
and he pointed to Don.

936
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:19,190
And he said,
"He isn't ready."

937
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:23,665
He was always upbeat
about my life after he was gone,

938
01:18:23,733 --> 01:18:27,169
and I was always, uh--

939
01:18:27,237 --> 01:18:30,434
uh, describing scenes...

940
01:18:30,507 --> 01:18:34,967
of wandering
the hideous byways, uh,

941
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:38,138
mewing outside a door
that never opened.

942
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,648
[Laughing]

943
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:44,448
Yes, we laughed a lot about that.

944
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58,029
Finally the last six months
of his life,

945
01:18:58,101 --> 01:19:01,537
I gave up working with anybody else
and worked with--

946
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:03,731
I only worked with Chris.

947
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:07,435
And we usually
did something every day,

948
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:11,844
and sometimes,
I would do as many as, um--

949
01:19:11,915 --> 01:19:16,375
uh, nine, 10 pictures of him.

950
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:22,153
<i>[White]
He was so profoundly affected...</i>

951
01:19:22,225 --> 01:19:25,388
<i>by the fact that he was dying,
and he knew he was dying,</i>

952
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:28,726
<i>and that Don was there
taking care of him to such an extent.</i>

953
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:30,732
<i>Because they were together
all the time,</i>

954
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,860
<i>and Don was painting him
and drawing him all the time.</i>

955
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:37,364
<i>Chris said over and over and over...</i>

956
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,671
<i>how much he loved Don
and how much it meant to him.</i>

957
01:19:40,743 --> 01:19:43,405
<i>Chris, as he was dying,
going through this period--</i>

958
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:46,937
<i>there was a kind of ecstasy
that he was going through--</i>

959
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:51,282
<i>that aspect of it--
his feelings of his love...</i>

960
01:19:51,354 --> 01:19:53,754
<i>being manifested with Don
and Don taking care of him.</i>

961
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:58,886
He was in great pain,
and it was a terrible situation,
what he was going through.

962
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:02,420
But I think what made
the situation bearable for him...

963
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:07,026
was his realization
that this love was manifested,

964
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:09,628
and that it was still his to the very end.

965
01:20:11,074 --> 01:20:14,100
<i>[Bachardy]
Of course, it's my instinct--</i>

966
01:20:14,177 --> 01:20:17,704
<i>Always when I work, I identify.</i>

967
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:20,442
<i>So I was in my artist mode,</i>

968
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:23,883
<i>but I was also identifying with Chris.</i>

969
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:26,888
<i>So in a way,
it became more and more...</i>

970
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:30,585
<i>like something
that we were doing together.</i>

971
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:35,527
<i>Here I was being an artist,</i>

972
01:20:35,598 --> 01:20:39,830
<i>and at the same time,
I was dying with Chris.</i>

973
01:20:43,306 --> 01:20:47,174
<i>And even when it was an effort for him,</i>

974
01:20:47,243 --> 01:20:52,647
<i>I excused myself
by saying to myself,</i>

975
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:54,808
<i>"Well, it serves him right...</i>

976
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:59,583
"for being responsible
for making me an artist in the first place,

977
01:20:59,656 --> 01:21:04,150
<i>"that I should devote myself
to this daily task...</i>

978
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:08,129
<i>of working with him. "</i>

979
01:21:11,668 --> 01:21:14,000
<i>In the later months,</i>

980
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:18,063
<i>he wasn't well enough even to sit up.</i>

981
01:21:18,141 --> 01:21:20,439
<i>And sometimes he was restless,</i>

982
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:24,503
<i>sometimes he was in a state
of half-sleeping, half-waking,</i>

983
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,913
<i>and moving a great deal.</i>

984
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:33,889
<i>Some of the pictures I did
were done in just a few minutes.</i>

985
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:38,256
<i>It was hard on him.</i>

986
01:21:39,262 --> 01:21:42,857
<i>And, uh, he would--
[Chuckles]
moan and--</i>

987
01:21:42,932 --> 01:21:45,867
<i>and be so weary of it.</i>

988
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:49,769
<i>But he would go on,
and so would I.</i>

989
01:21:51,507 --> 01:21:55,671
<i>And a lot of our sittings...</i>

990
01:21:55,745 --> 01:22:00,114
<i>began to take place at night
by artificial light.</i>

991
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:08,114
<i>And sometimes
I would look later at the pictures...</i>

992
01:22:08,191 --> 01:22:10,523
<i>and be shocked...</i>

993
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:15,326
<i>that I could do
such a stark picture of Chris.</i>

994
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:23,264
We're getting very close
to the end.

995
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:38,145
This is the first
of the drawings I did...

996
01:22:38,221 --> 01:22:40,781
after he was dead.

997
01:22:49,599 --> 01:22:52,397
<i>It was a Saturday morning...</i>

998
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:57,706
<i>and we were completely alone
in the house.</i>

999
01:22:58,775 --> 01:23:02,575
<i>And I spent the rest of the day, um--</i>

1000
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:04,579
<i>uh, drawing his corpse.</i>

1001
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:11,086
<i>I'd been drawing him steadily,
uh, every day.</i>

1002
01:23:11,154 --> 01:23:16,057
<i>I hadn't missed a day in--
in several weeks.</i>

1003
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:21,563
<i>I continued that day.
I wasn't sure I'd have the courage to do it.</i>

1004
01:23:21,631 --> 01:23:25,795
And one of the things
that spurred me on...

1005
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:29,770
was my belief that he--

1006
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:33,070
he would have been cheering me on,

1007
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:35,076
that he would say,

1008
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:38,910
"Yes, uh, that's
what an artist would do."

1009
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:50,482
And that's what an artist did do.

1010
01:23:57,333 --> 01:24:00,461
[Voice Breaking]
Yes, I know he would have been...

1011
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:04,296
proud of me.

1012
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:20,614
<i>[Boorman]
I was so impressed when Chris died,</i>

1013
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:23,682
<i>and Don said,
"I'm reading his diaries now.</i>

1014
01:24:23,759 --> 01:24:26,990
I'm starting from the present.
I'm working backwards."

1015
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:32,729
<i>And he said, "I just can't wait
to come to the point at which we met. "</i>

1016
01:24:32,802 --> 01:24:37,671
<i>So he would then have
Isherwood's account of their first meeting.</i>

1017
01:24:43,946 --> 01:24:46,938
[Water Running]

1018
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:07,865
<i>[Bachardy]
In a way, I've managed to satisfy
my acting ambitions,</i>

1019
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:13,876
<i>because what I'm really doing
is impersonating my sitter when I'm painting.</i>

1020
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:25,183
<i>Every face has to be important.</i>

1021
01:25:25,254 --> 01:25:28,018
<i>Every face.</i>

1022
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:31,617
<i>And when you think,
each individual...</i>

1023
01:25:31,694 --> 01:25:34,891
<i>is showing me a face...</i>

1024
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:40,231
<i>that he is living his entire life with.</i>

1025
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:44,239
<i>So it has to be
of immense importance.</i>
