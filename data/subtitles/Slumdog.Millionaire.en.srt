1
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:34,786
Name?

2
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:52,353
Good evening! Namaskaar,
Sasrakaar, Aadaam.

3
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:57,361
Welcome to "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"!

4
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:00,686
Are you ready?

5
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,420
Yes.

6
00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:06,265
<i>Please give a big round of applause,</i>

7
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,199
Good Luck Kid.
<i>To a very first contestant of the night,</i>

8
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,942
Jamal Malik from our very own,
Aarmchi Mumbay!

9
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,598
Hello, let's play.

10
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:28,114
Smile, you'll be fine.

11
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,450
Name.

12
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:37,473
Motherfucker, name?

13
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:39,550
Jamal. Malik.

14
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:41,050
You have a name.

15
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:43,789
Good. Stop, crying.

16
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:46,975
Thank you. Thank you.

17
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,697
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, very much.

18
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,149
So Jamal...

19
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:55,491
tell me something about yourself.

20
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:01,282
I work in a call-center...

21
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:03,900
in Juhu.
Good.

22
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:06,949
A phone basher..

23
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:09,282
And what type of call-center
should that be?

24
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,206
XL5 mobile phones.

25
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:14,615
So you are the one who calls me up

26
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:16,491
every single day of my life
with special offers?

27
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:20,483
No, actually I am an assistant.

28
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:22,447
An assistant phone basher?

29
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:28,681
And what does an assistant
phone basher do exactly?

30
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:32,199
I get tea for people and...

31
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,612
Chaiwalla?

32
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:35,069
A chaiwalla!

33
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:40,146
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,507
Jamal Malik...
one who serves hot tea from Mumbay,

35
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:47,104
let's play "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"

36
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:59,344
So, has he confessed yet?

37
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:02,346
Except his name I could not get
anything out of the runt.

38
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:05,163
You have been here the whole
bloody night, Srinivas.

39
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:06,479
What have you been doing?

40
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,246
He's a tough guy.

41
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,378
A little electricity will
loosen his tongue, give him.

42
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:12,585
Yes sir.

43
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:24,377
Ok, so were you wired up?

44
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:26,644
Mobile phone or a pager?

45
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:30,377
Or coughing accomplice in the audience?

46
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:33,754
Or microchip under your skin?

47
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,744
The chip is not here.
Not here?

48
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:43,185
No.
Ok, leave it.

49
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,781
Leave it. Leave it.

50
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,274
It's hot, and my wife is giving me hell.

51
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:53,718
I've got a desk full of murderers,

52
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,812
rapists,

53
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,634
extortionists, bomb bandits,

54
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:58,911
and you.

55
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:04,504
So why don't you save us
both a lot of time?

56
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:07,892
And tell me how you cheated?

57
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,893
I'm done sir.

58
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:32,793
Now listen.

59
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:36,824
Hello!

60
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:42,423
He's is unconscious, fucker.
What good is that?

61
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,101
How many times have I told you,
you should once...

62
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:47,425
I'm sorry sir.

63
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:48,540
Good, good, good Srinivas...

64
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:51,110
Now we'll have Amnesty
International here next

65
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,976
peeing in their pants about human rights.

66
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,338
Sir I was thinking...

67
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,776
Get him down, tidy him up please.
For God's sake!

68
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:01,139
Sir, what if he did know the answers?

69
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,369
Professors, doctors, lawyers,

70
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,708
general knowledge-wallas never
get beyond 60000 rupees.

71
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:11,339
He's on 10 million.

72
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,274
What the hell can a slumdog possibly know?

73
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:18,908
The answers!

74
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,072
I knew the answers...

75
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:10,928
If the planes won't kill you, we will!

76
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:29,404
Repeat it!
"You have sent for me, Sir?" said Athos.

77
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,756
So...

78
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:12,571
Mr. Malik,

79
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:15,413
the man who knows all the answers.

80
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,428
Talk.

81
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,514
Whoreson talk!

82
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:27,725
<i>So Jamal,</i>

83
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,905
<i>are you ready for the first
question, for 1000 rupees?</i>

84
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,697
<i>Yes.</i>

85
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:36,326
<i>Not bad money to sit on a chair
and answer a question.</i>

86
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,062
<i>Better than making tea, no?</i>

87
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:41,327
No. Yes. No.

88
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,759
No? Yes? No?

89
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,475
Is that your final answer?

90
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,988
So remember.

91
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:50,673
You have three lifelines.

92
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,219
Ask the audience.

93
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:54,033
50/50.

94
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:55,825
Call a friend.

95
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:59,019
So the first question, for 1000 rupees,
here we go.

96
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:04,817
Who was the star in the 1973
hit-film "Zanjeer"?

97
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:06,062
Amitabh!

98
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:10,808
Amitabh Bachchan!

99
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:52,799
Yea, got Amithab's autograph!

100
00:14:57,601 --> 00:14:59,313
A. Amitabh Bachchan.

101
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:03,336
Guess what, you're right.
You just won 1,000 rupees.

102
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,830
You don't have to be a genius.

103
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,222
I knew it was Amitabh Bachchan.

104
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,851
Like I said, you do not
have to be a genius.

105
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:21,254
He's the most famous man in India.

106
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:24,865
<i>A picture of three lions,</i>

107
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,527
<i>as seen on the national emblem of India.</i>

108
00:15:28,383 --> 00:15:30,787
<i>What is written underneath?</i>

109
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:51,812
What do you think, Jamal?

110
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:56,256
The most famous phrase of our country.

111
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:57,998
Do you like to call a friend?

112
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:00,311
Ask the audience.

113
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:04,111
<i>Put the poor man out of his
misery, ladies and gentlemen?</i>

114
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:07,345
My five-year old daughter
can answer that question,

115
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:08,731
but you couldn't.

116
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:11,567
That's strange for a millionaire genius.

117
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:13,830
What happened?

118
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:17,145
Your accomplice sneaked out for a piss?

119
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,208
The inspector is asking something.

120
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:23,476
How much is panipuri at
Dharisha store on Chowpatty?

121
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,485
What?

122
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,797
Panipuri.

123
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,389
One plate, how much?

124
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,879
10 rupees.
Wrong.

125
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:32,665
15 since Diwali.

126
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:36,979
Who stole Constable Varmy's bicycle

127
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,692
outside Santa Cruz station last Thursday?

128
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:42,750
You know who that was?

129
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,144
Everyone in Juhu knows that.

130
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,898
Even five year old.

131
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,995
Congratulations, Jamal.
You just won 4,000 rupees.

132
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:02,326
A 16 thousand rupees.

133
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:05,996
Religion.

134
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:08,333
Interesting.

135
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:11,659
In depictions of God Rama,

136
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,711
he is famously holding what in his right hand?

137
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:53,473
I wake up every morning wishing I did
not know the answer to that question.

138
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,834
If it wasn't for Rama and Allah...

139
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,759
I would still have a mother.

140
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,682
A bow and arrow.

141
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:17,661
Final answer?

142
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:21,386
Final answer.

143
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,903
Computer-ji, lock D.

144
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,881
You just won 16000 rupees.

145
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:37,790
Well done, my friend.

146
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:43,454
Time for commercial break.
Don't go away, now.

147
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:46,999
You got lucky, huh?

148
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,692
If I were you I'd take the money and run.

149
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,397
You're not going to the next one.

150
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:27,468
Welcome back to
"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"

151
00:23:27,502 --> 00:23:31,026
Our contestant, Jamal Malik,
call-center assistant from Mumbay,

152
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,900
is on 16 thousand rupees,

153
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,346
and has already used only one
lifeline, ask the audience.

154
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,330
So my friend,

155
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,575
you're into serious money.

156
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,837
Yes.

157
00:23:57,357 --> 00:23:59,842
A: Surdas.

158
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:02,098
B: Tulsidas.

159
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,931
C: Mira Bai.

160
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,436
D: Kabir.

161
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:04,333
Hello.

162
00:25:09,118 --> 00:25:10,165
It's hot, huh?

163
00:25:58,665 --> 00:25:59,665
Here son.

164
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:23,935
Arvind.

165
00:26:39,317 --> 00:26:40,217
Salim.

166
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:48,477
No.

167
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:50,177
Just give...

168
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:04,692
Come.

169
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,166
Surdas.

170
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:41,210
Surdas?

171
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:45,762
Surdas,

172
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:48,411
is your final answer?

173
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:51,373
Yes.

174
00:37:56,282 --> 00:37:57,605
Guess what,

175
00:37:59,818 --> 00:38:01,172
you're right!

176
00:38:12,282 --> 00:38:14,938
What happened to a girl?
They blinded her too?

177
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:19,893
They had other plans.

178
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,226
Well it took me a long time to find out.

179
00:41:39,307 --> 00:41:40,840
Is this heaven?

180
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:47,925
You are not dead, Jamal.

181
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,523
What is it?

182
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:52,706
Some hotel huh?

183
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:58,507
The Taj Mahal is considered the
finest example of Mugal architecture.

184
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:09,003
Taj Mahal was completed around 1648 using
the labour force of 20'000 workers.

185
00:42:09,338 --> 00:42:14,913
In 1980 it became a UNESCO
World Heritage Site and was cited as the...

186
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:51,744
Please, please.

187
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:53,768
What time is the next tour?

188
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:56,193
We are on tight schedule, you see.

189
00:42:56,193 --> 00:42:58,405
Have to see the Red Fort this afternoon.

190
00:42:59,268 --> 00:43:02,067
Please, would it be possible
to show us up round now?

191
00:43:02,867 --> 00:43:07,349
Obviously we understand that it
costs more for just the two of us.

192
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,626
But of course madam!

193
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,740
Please follow me.

194
00:43:14,268 --> 00:43:18,231
The Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Khurrama

195
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:23,565
for his wife Mumtaz, who was the
maximum beautiful woman in the world.

196
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:29,268
Then when she died, the emperor
decided to build this five-star hotel,

197
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:32,231
for everyone who would
like to visit her tomb.

198
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:35,217
But he died in 1587,

199
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:38,978
before any of the rooms were
built, or any of the lifts.

200
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:46,065
But this swimming pool as you can see was
completed on schedule in top class fashion.

201
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,831
Is says nothing of this in the guide book.

202
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:54,266
The guide book was written by a bunch
of lazy good-for-nothing Indian beggars.

203
00:43:56,898 --> 00:43:59,003
And this lady and gentlemen,

204
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,778
is the burial place of Mumtaz.

205
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,429
How did she die?

206
00:44:05,264 --> 00:44:07,764
A road traffic accident.
Really?

207
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,931
Maximum pile-up.

208
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:13,429
I thought she died in childbirth.

209
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:16,014
Exactly sir.

210
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:18,976
She was on the way to
hospital when it happened.

211
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,510
Ready?

212
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,407
Smile.

213
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:38,547
Shoes!

214
00:44:39,161 --> 00:44:41,244
American brands!
Shoes!

215
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:57,532
It's high temperature?

216
00:45:02,297 --> 00:45:03,454
Smile.

217
00:45:18,862 --> 00:45:23,161
This, Mr David, is the biggest
Dhobi Ghat in the whole of India.

218
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:24,626
That's amazing.

219
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:28,061
Come on, take a real good look at this.

220
00:45:28,996 --> 00:45:31,927
They say that every man in Uttar Pradesh

221
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:37,360
is wearing a kurta that has been
at least washed once out here.

222
00:45:43,632 --> 00:45:48,501
Move it around! Pit-stop's god
speed! Schumacher's style!

223
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,268
There are the cows or are those buffaloes.
What are those over there?

224
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:54,766
Go, go. Let's run!

225
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:04,123
Oh, shit.

226
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,224
What the hell happened here?

227
00:46:05,226 --> 00:46:06,226
Motherfucker!

228
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:12,927
Ok, that's enough!

229
00:46:14,295 --> 00:46:16,222
Ok. Hold it!
Hold it, will you.

230
00:46:16,259 --> 00:46:18,260
You've got the insurance don't you?

231
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:19,414
Are you ok?

232
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:22,043
You wanted to see a bit of real India?

233
00:46:22,257 --> 00:46:23,266
Here it is!

234
00:46:23,454 --> 00:46:24,556
Al right!

235
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,534
Well, here is a bit of
the real America, son.

236
00:46:29,565 --> 00:46:30,893
Oh, yes, yes! Jesus...

237
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:35,291
Here.

238
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:21,652
On an American 100 dollar bill,

239
00:48:22,253 --> 00:48:26,576
there's a portrait of which
American statesman?

240
00:48:44,195 --> 00:48:48,016
Pay or play, Jamal?

241
00:48:49,286 --> 00:48:50,887
You decide.

242
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:55,351
Oh god he's looking at the camera.
He hasn't got a clue.

243
00:48:56,286 --> 00:48:58,070
This is gonna be a walk away.
Stand by.

244
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:01,449
No, he's gonna play with him first.

245
00:49:02,286 --> 00:49:03,617
<i>Jamal?</i>

246
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:07,900
Get a lot of 100 dollar bills
in your in your line of work?

247
00:49:09,436 --> 00:49:11,717
A minimum tip for my services.

248
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:16,250
Oh, now I know why my
cellphone bills are so high.

249
00:49:16,485 --> 00:49:19,251
They tip the chaiwalla with 100 dollar bills.

250
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:22,766
It's C. Benjamin Franklin.

251
00:49:23,302 --> 00:49:24,516
<i>You're gonna play, huh?</i>

252
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,248
<i>I think I've just had, hadn't I?</i>

253
00:49:27,284 --> 00:49:28,766
<i>So you exactly have C, right?</i>

254
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,150
Who's on 1,000 rupee note?

255
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:33,346
I don't know.

256
00:49:34,699 --> 00:49:35,853
You don't know?

257
00:49:37,563 --> 00:49:38,775
Ghandi-ji.

258
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:42,469
I have heard of him.

259
00:49:45,284 --> 00:49:46,548
Don't get clever

260
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,047
or I'll get the electricity out again.

261
00:49:49,782 --> 00:49:50,782
Look.

262
00:49:51,248 --> 00:49:53,438
They didn't ask me that question.

263
00:49:53,751 --> 00:49:55,159
I don't know why.

264
00:49:55,882 --> 00:49:57,112
Ask them.

265
00:49:57,248 --> 00:50:00,347
It's funny, you don't seem
like you're interested in money.

266
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:05,255
<i>By the fact you have...</i>

267
00:50:06,585 --> 00:50:08,965
<i>one million rupees!</i>

268
00:50:14,195 --> 00:50:16,148
Explain the 100 dollar bill.

269
00:50:18,246 --> 00:50:21,791
Bombay had turned name to Mumbay.

270
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:27,101
Why don't you understand?

271
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:38,831
Two chicken burgers, two fries,
one mango rassi, one coke!

272
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,594
One mineral water!

273
00:51:43,278 --> 00:51:44,320
Shimla.

274
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:48,581
I'm going to Chowpatty, ok?

275
00:51:48,996 --> 00:51:50,244
Wanna come?

276
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:53,253
For god's sake,

277
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:55,043
you've got some disease?

278
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:57,661
You're forcing back to this shithole.

279
00:51:57,795 --> 00:52:00,242
We leave our friends, a good life,

280
00:52:00,476 --> 00:52:03,360
lots of money. For this?

281
00:52:03,394 --> 00:52:04,909
We came back to find her.

282
00:52:05,143 --> 00:52:07,541
You did.
I don't give a shit about her.

283
00:52:08,577 --> 00:52:10,643
Plenty of pussy in Bombay for Salim.

284
00:52:11,277 --> 00:52:12,309
Oh yes sir!

285
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:15,041
You should come back to
the Cages on Saturday night,

286
00:52:15,476 --> 00:52:18,539
instead of ghost searching
for your lost love.

287
00:52:19,275 --> 00:52:21,057
I'm going to Chowpatty.

288
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:23,407
I'm going to Chowpatty!

289
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:27,541
There are 19 million
people in this city, Jamal.

290
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:30,442
Forget about her.

291
00:52:31,277 --> 00:52:32,429
She is a street.

292
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,467
Benjamin Franklin.

293
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:47,202
I'm sorry...

294
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:15,117
Thanks.

295
00:54:34,534 --> 00:54:35,534
Know Cherry?

296
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:49,472
Where can we found Cherry?

297
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,990
You want Cherry?

298
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,445
Get lost! Go home.

299
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:08,833
Where's Cherry?

300
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:36,733
Cherry?
Inside.

301
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:47,217
So, is it her or not?

302
00:55:54,266 --> 00:55:56,481
She's sexy, man!

303
00:55:56,782 --> 00:55:57,782
Get on, Latika!

304
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:04,295
Who is this?
Jamal?

305
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:06,190
I'll get the bags.
Who are you?

306
00:56:06,204 --> 00:56:07,230
What do you want?

307
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:09,630
You stupid boys!
Pack it in! Put that.

308
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,067
How did you find me?

309
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,264
Later, later...

310
00:56:17,231 --> 00:56:18,496
Take the cash. Come on!

311
00:56:18,496 --> 00:56:19,641
Come on. We got it.

312
00:56:19,655 --> 00:56:20,858
Let's go! Let's go!

313
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,119
Shit.

314
00:56:24,231 --> 00:56:26,760
Look who we have here!

315
00:56:28,867 --> 00:56:30,375
Hello again.

316
00:56:31,217 --> 00:56:32,336
Jamal,

317
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,222
Salim.

318
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:38,077
I never forget a face.

319
00:56:39,264 --> 00:56:40,195
Right Punnoose?

320
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:43,047
Especially one that I own.

321
00:56:46,228 --> 00:56:51,929
You really thought you could just
walk in and take my prize away?

322
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:53,556
Latika, come.

323
00:56:59,427 --> 00:57:03,456
Have you any idea how much
this little virgin is worth?

324
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:04,811
Sisterfucker!

325
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,235
Please continue, Master-ji.
Ok, sir.

326
00:57:08,335 --> 00:57:09,896
Get them out of here!
No!

327
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:20,067
Move! Get over there!

328
00:57:21,228 --> 00:57:23,527
Let's not be foolish, Salim.

329
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:28,246
Heavy, isn't it?

330
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,724
Give it to me.

331
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,898
On your knees!

332
00:57:32,211 --> 00:57:33,211
Down!

333
00:57:35,777 --> 00:57:37,027
Both of you! Down!

334
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:42,989
Money!

335
00:57:44,925 --> 00:57:46,092
You can have money,

336
00:57:47,106 --> 00:57:48,094
here.

337
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,760
Look.

338
00:57:56,224 --> 00:57:57,425
Take it.

339
00:57:57,739 --> 00:58:01,940
Go, disappear with your friend
and we'll forget all about this, ok?

340
00:58:03,259 --> 00:58:04,836
Maman never forgets.

341
00:58:05,851 --> 00:58:07,376
Isn't that right?

342
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:09,967
Oh, Maman can make an exception.

343
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:14,210
I can't take that risk Maman.

344
00:58:15,123 --> 00:58:16,070
Sorry.

345
00:58:27,259 --> 00:58:28,349
Let's go.

346
00:58:30,224 --> 00:58:31,083
Stay!

347
00:58:31,297 --> 00:58:32,472
Jamal!

348
00:58:32,684 --> 00:58:33,784
Jamal!

349
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:39,940
Let's go! Let's go!

350
00:58:48,222 --> 00:58:52,396
Who invented the revolver?

351
00:58:58,255 --> 00:58:59,987
Samuel Colt.

352
00:59:01,222 --> 00:59:03,123
Final answer?

353
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:06,186
Final answer.

354
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,335
Jamal Malik,

355
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:11,422
you're on a dream run.

356
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,822
My heart says you're gonna win more.

357
00:59:16,257 --> 00:59:17,456
Computer-ji,

358
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,769
A lock.

359
00:59:27,255 --> 00:59:28,485
I was right.

360
00:59:29,221 --> 00:59:31,619
The chaiwalla has done it again.

361
00:59:34,722 --> 00:59:36,056
Incredible!

362
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,039
Reception!

363
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:01,739
Let's go.

364
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,130
Found something?

365
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:21,016
Stay there. Look away.

366
01:00:21,253 --> 01:00:22,782
Ok, ok.

367
01:00:23,217 --> 01:00:26,219
I'll know if you're looking.

368
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:27,481
No I'm not.

369
01:00:28,217 --> 01:00:30,105
Is Salim still there?

370
01:00:38,253 --> 01:00:39,375
Where is Salim?

371
01:00:42,768 --> 01:00:43,981
I don't know.

372
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,521
You're a sweet boy, Jamal.

373
01:01:42,175 --> 01:01:43,661
I'm looking for Javed.

374
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:47,675
Motherfucker!
He's not looking for you.

375
01:01:51,248 --> 01:01:52,980
I killed Maman,

376
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:55,913
and I'll kill you too.

377
01:02:00,248 --> 01:02:02,057
Easy.

378
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,271
Did you really kill him?

379
01:02:10,215 --> 01:02:11,291
Good.

380
01:02:12,405 --> 01:02:14,434
My enemy's enemy is a friend.

381
01:02:17,248 --> 01:02:19,108
Come here, my friend.

382
01:02:25,414 --> 01:02:27,614
I've been looking for someone like you.

383
01:02:35,246 --> 01:02:37,311
You came back for me.

384
01:02:39,246 --> 01:02:40,577
Of course.

385
01:02:44,213 --> 01:02:46,675
I thought you'd forgotten.

386
01:02:47,311 --> 01:02:49,226
I never forgot.

387
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:51,525
Not for one moment.

388
01:02:52,246 --> 01:02:54,510
I knew I'd find you in the end.

389
01:02:55,246 --> 01:02:57,710
It's our destiny.

390
01:02:59,244 --> 01:03:00,967
Destiny?

391
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:04,048
Ok.

392
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:21,748
Hey.

393
01:03:27,242 --> 01:03:28,474
Come.

394
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,210
No, brother. You had a lot to drink.

395
01:03:32,244 --> 01:03:34,027
I am the elder.

396
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,222
I am the boss.

397
01:03:36,244 --> 01:03:39,210
For once, you do as I say.

398
01:03:39,244 --> 01:03:40,873
Now get out!

399
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:44,208
Come on, I saved your life, didn't I?

400
01:03:44,244 --> 01:03:45,472
Salim, please...

401
01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:46,474
Shut up.

402
01:03:47,472 --> 01:03:48,905
I'll kill you!

403
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:49,907
Salim!

404
01:03:56,907 --> 01:03:58,007
I'll kill you!

405
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,907
I am number one now.

406
01:04:09,807 --> 01:04:10,807
Salim!

407
01:04:10,942 --> 01:04:12,018
Salim! Open!

408
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,871
Shut up!

409
01:04:16,206 --> 01:04:18,771
The man with the Colt 45 says shut up!

410
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:23,106
Go now or gun master-ji and I will
shoot you right between the eyes.

411
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,172
Don't think you won't.

412
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:29,405
I'm giving you five seconds.

413
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,240
One.

414
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:33,958
Two.

415
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,628
Go, Jamal.

416
01:04:40,528 --> 01:04:41,528
Go.

417
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,735
Let's go.

418
01:05:08,206 --> 01:05:10,304
So, did you see them again?

419
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:12,405
I wouldn't be here if I had.

420
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,121
Was she pretty?

421
01:05:19,556 --> 01:05:20,780
I guess not.

422
01:05:22,804 --> 01:05:25,547
The most beautiful woman in the world.

423
01:05:25,548 --> 01:05:27,161
You mean the bitch of the slum.

424
01:05:27,661 --> 01:05:28,661
Sisterfucker.

425
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:32,059
Hey hero.

426
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,762
Hey beat him!

427
01:05:36,764 --> 01:05:37,762
Hey lock him down!

428
01:05:37,864 --> 01:05:40,364
Lock him... he fights! Motherfucker!

429
01:05:40,753 --> 01:05:41,990
Well well...

430
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,280
The slumdog barks.

431
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:46,367
Money and women.

432
01:05:46,802 --> 01:05:49,704
The reasons for make most mistakes in life.
Correct.

433
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:52,797
Looks like you've mixed up both.

434
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:56,597
Srinivas,

435
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,277
you need the exercise.

436
01:06:00,012 --> 01:06:02,036
Go and get me something to eat.

437
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:03,902
Yes sir.

438
01:06:04,911 --> 01:06:06,244
And tea.

439
01:06:18,202 --> 01:06:20,157
Idiot, Srinivas.

440
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:28,166
You puzzled me slumdog.

441
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,099
Admitting murder to avoid child fraud.

442
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:34,802
Is not exactly clever thinking.

443
01:06:37,135 --> 01:06:38,764
Now why would you do that?

444
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:44,112
When somebody asks me a question,

445
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,112
I tell them the answer.

446
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:56,800
So, how did you manage to get on the show?

447
01:06:59,835 --> 01:07:02,016
Okay everyone, listen up.

448
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,800
It's been a big week for UK.

449
01:07:05,735 --> 01:07:07,463
Kat is back.

450
01:07:07,998 --> 01:07:09,268
But she is already back.

451
01:07:09,481 --> 01:07:10,500
Bardi...

452
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,329
Jamal?

453
01:07:12,817 --> 01:07:14,838
Oh, well, she did come back,

454
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:17,311
then she went away when
Alfie split up with her,

455
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,003
and now she's back again,

456
01:07:19,105 --> 01:07:21,197
but it looks as if Alfie
still fancies more...

457
01:07:21,231 --> 01:07:22,862
Thank you, Jamal.

458
01:07:23,597 --> 01:07:26,027
Bardi, keep up. The chaiwalla
knows more than you.

459
01:07:27,563 --> 01:07:31,056
Anyway, there's also the
festival in Edinburgh.

460
01:07:31,056 --> 01:07:32,748
Anybody knows Edinburgh, Edinburgh?

461
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:35,360
Kilts, castles,

462
01:07:36,175 --> 01:07:37,177
Haggis.

463
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,010
Ben Navis.

464
01:07:39,032 --> 01:07:40,164
Good, yes?

465
01:07:40,498 --> 01:07:44,097
Inspector Taggart, whiskey, Sean Connery.

466
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:47,099
Good, and "lochs". Their word for lakes.

467
01:07:47,539 --> 01:07:48,929
No filming.

468
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,565
Jamal?

469
01:07:56,978 --> 01:07:58,161
Come here.

470
01:07:58,795 --> 01:08:00,197
I'm on "Millionaire" duty today.

471
01:08:00,733 --> 01:08:01,755
Dev!

472
01:08:01,887 --> 01:08:04,083
Please, just for five minutes.
I can't.

473
01:08:05,563 --> 01:08:06,500
Sit here.

474
01:08:06,635 --> 01:08:09,364
If the team leader comes just pretend
you're on a call doing an upgrade for.

475
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:10,793
"Friends and Family", I know. Yeah.

476
01:08:11,893 --> 01:08:13,144
Two minutes.

477
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,206
<i>"Who wants to be a millionaire?"</i>

478
01:08:20,907 --> 01:08:22,962
<i>Dial this number now!</i>

479
01:08:27,543 --> 01:08:29,293
Hello. Hello!

480
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,345
I would like to be a contestant of
"Who wants to be a millionaire?"

481
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:38,158
Bloody bastard. I never get it.

482
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:41,194
You have to dial, when Prem says "if".

483
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:42,708
That's when they open the lines.

484
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,158
How the hell do you know that?

485
01:08:44,693 --> 01:08:47,694
That's what Anjum in Technical
says. He put a system in.

486
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:49,962
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

487
01:08:49,963 --> 01:08:53,024
<i>Forgetting someone there for god's sake?</i>

488
01:08:53,845 --> 01:08:57,418
<i>Hello?
Dear god will somebody talk to me?</i>

489
01:08:58,253 --> 01:08:59,305
Hello.

490
01:09:00,118 --> 01:09:02,498
Mrs. MacKintosh from...

491
01:09:02,912 --> 01:09:04,591
Kin.. gussie.

492
01:09:04,591 --> 01:09:08,094
<i>It's Kingussie, love.
Pronounced: "Kee-nu-ssi".</i>

493
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:11,056
<i>So where are you from?
Abroad I bet?</i>

494
01:09:11,391 --> 01:09:14,393
Just down the road from
your house, Mrs. MacKintosh.

495
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:16,560
Next to the "loch".

496
01:09:17,162 --> 01:09:19,291
<i>Ok, which "loch"?</i>

497
01:09:19,891 --> 01:09:26,225
"Loch" Big... "loch" Ben... "Loch" Big Ben.

498
01:09:26,226 --> 01:09:28,698
Next door to Sean Connery's flat.

499
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,096
<i>Look. I'd like to your supervisor, son?</i>

500
01:10:19,224 --> 01:10:20,506
<i>Yes?</i>

501
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:22,154
Salim?

502
01:10:22,189 --> 01:10:24,587
<i>Who is this?
Do you know what time is this?</i>

503
01:10:34,224 --> 01:10:35,225
<i>Hello?</i>

504
01:10:48,224 --> 01:10:49,225
<i>Hello?</i>

505
01:10:50,225 --> 01:10:51,225
<i>Hello?</i>

506
01:10:52,488 --> 01:10:54,353
<i>Who is this?</i>

507
01:10:56,188 --> 01:10:58,753
I'm calling from XL5 Communications sir.

508
01:10:59,189 --> 01:11:05,188
As a valued customer, we are offering you
a free upgrade with our "Friends and...

509
01:11:05,222 --> 01:11:06,551
family".

510
01:11:07,386 --> 01:11:08,551
<i>Jamal?</i>

511
01:11:10,064 --> 01:11:11,801
<i>Is that you, brother?</i>

512
01:11:12,422 --> 01:11:15,787
<i>Where are you?
I thought you were dead or something.</i>

513
01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:18,353
<i>Listen, we had to go Jamal.</i>

514
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:22,086
<i>Maman's guys...
they were searching the hotel.</i>

515
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,962
<i>Jamal?</i>

516
01:11:24,176 --> 01:11:26,287
<i>Say something, please!</i>

517
01:11:27,721 --> 01:11:29,150
Hello, Salim!

518
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:33,186
Cambridge Circus is not in Cambridge.

519
01:11:33,221 --> 01:11:35,149
Can I ask why?

520
01:11:35,185 --> 01:11:39,185
Too obvious. There's definitely
an Oxford Circus in London.

521
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,354
There's a rowing race between Oxford
and Cambridge, so there's probably

522
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:45,998
a Cambridge Circus too, no?

523
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,340
I'll go for D.

524
01:11:47,453 --> 01:11:48,265
London.

525
01:11:48,787 --> 01:11:50,087
Computer-ji,

526
01:11:51,201 --> 01:11:52,899
D lock.

527
01:12:00,407 --> 01:12:01,806
Jamal Malik,

528
01:12:02,121 --> 01:12:04,220
you are absolutely right.

529
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,283
<i>It's getting hot in here.</i>

530
01:12:17,818 --> 01:12:18,884
Are you nervous?

531
01:12:19,018 --> 01:12:20,048
What?

532
01:12:21,185 --> 01:12:22,947
Am I nervous?

533
01:12:23,182 --> 01:12:25,484
It's you who's in the hot seat, my friend.

534
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,248
<i>Oh yes, sorry.</i>

535
01:12:29,484 --> 01:12:31,382
Balli, he's got prey on the run.

536
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:33,047
Finally.

537
01:12:33,384 --> 01:12:34,748
<i>A few hours ago...</i>

538
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,481
you were giving chai
for the phone wallas.

539
01:12:38,717 --> 01:12:41,684
And now you're richer
than they will ever be.

540
01:12:42,219 --> 01:12:43,846
What a player!

541
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:48,381
Ladies and gentlemen, what a player!

542
01:13:30,216 --> 01:13:31,645
Jamal?

543
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:37,079
God is good, Brother.
God is good.

544
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,853
Maman's guys were out for us.

545
01:13:54,867 --> 01:13:56,193
We just had to escape.

546
01:13:56,213 --> 01:13:56,899
Liar.

547
01:13:57,113 --> 01:13:58,858
I left a message for you at work.

548
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:00,012
We waited for weeks for you at Nagpur.

549
01:14:00,014 --> 01:14:01,951
There was no message.
Brother.

550
01:14:02,265 --> 01:14:03,787
I definitely left a message.

551
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:07,103
There was no message! There was no message!
There was no message!

552
01:14:12,243 --> 01:14:14,225
I will never forgive you.

553
01:14:20,176 --> 01:14:21,402
I know.

554
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,280
That used to be our slum.

555
01:14:30,795 --> 01:14:32,292
Can you believe that, huh?

556
01:14:33,213 --> 01:14:35,778
We used to live right there man.

557
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:41,140
Now is all business.

558
01:14:41,676 --> 01:14:44,478
India is at the centre of
the world now. Brother.

559
01:14:45,212 --> 01:14:46,743
And I...

560
01:14:47,378 --> 01:14:50,877
I am at the centre of the centre.

561
01:14:53,313 --> 01:14:55,940
This is all Javed's houses.

562
01:14:58,176 --> 01:14:59,305
Javed Khan?

563
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,189
The gangster from our slum?

564
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:03,439
You work for him?

565
01:15:03,475 --> 01:15:04,476
Come on.

566
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,979
Who else would save us from Maman's guys?

567
01:15:07,311 --> 01:15:09,252
What do you do for him?

568
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:13,105
Anything he asks.

569
01:15:20,676 --> 01:15:21,908
He's coming.

570
01:15:22,222 --> 01:15:23,686
You need to go now.

571
01:15:24,801 --> 01:15:25,876
Take my card.

572
01:15:26,211 --> 01:15:27,240
What for?

573
01:15:27,475 --> 01:15:29,774
You think them gonna let you
out of my sight again?

574
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:32,175
You stay with me my younger brother.

575
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:34,338
Now go. My place.

576
01:15:35,351 --> 01:15:36,351
Salim!

577
01:15:37,173 --> 01:15:38,574
Where is Latika?

578
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:40,256
Still?

579
01:15:43,373 --> 01:15:44,807
She's gone brother.

580
01:15:45,421 --> 01:15:46,774
Long gone.

581
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,568
Now go.

582
01:15:49,381 --> 01:15:51,070
Go to my place.

583
01:16:15,173 --> 01:16:16,721
Ok, Sir. I'll be right there.

584
01:16:51,154 --> 01:16:52,255
Go.

585
01:17:36,849 --> 01:17:39,701
Brother-ji, I am your new
cook from the agency.

586
01:17:39,713 --> 01:17:42,068
Thousands apologies,
I'm so late for the Mensa.

587
01:17:43,003 --> 01:17:44,673
Just a minute.

588
01:18:00,865 --> 01:18:02,065
<i>Excuse me.</i>

589
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:04,533
<i>There's nothing about any cook.</i>

590
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:07,472
<i>There's a dishwasher being delivered.</i>

591
01:18:08,287 --> 01:18:09,567
<i>Do you know anything about that?</i>

592
01:18:10,202 --> 01:18:13,557
Oh brother, I... I'm your dishwasher.

593
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,221
Jamal!

594
01:19:22,201 --> 01:19:23,720
Look at you.

595
01:19:30,643 --> 01:19:32,244
I've found you!

596
01:19:36,144 --> 01:19:37,345
I've found you.

597
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:47,020
Your face.

598
01:19:48,162 --> 01:19:49,363
You've hurt your eye.

599
01:19:49,599 --> 01:19:50,930
Why are you here?

600
01:19:53,698 --> 01:19:54,923
To see you.

601
01:19:55,646 --> 01:19:56,646
Why?

602
01:19:57,161 --> 01:19:58,578
You see me,

603
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:00,689
now what?

604
01:20:10,962 --> 01:20:12,961
Why does everyone love this program?

605
01:20:14,197 --> 01:20:15,788
This is a chance to escape,

606
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:18,172
isn't it?

607
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:20,560
Walk into another life.

608
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:23,225
Oh, god.

609
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:29,761
Javed will kill you. Here.

610
01:20:30,896 --> 01:20:31,925
Javed?

611
01:20:32,759 --> 01:20:33,944
You are with him?

612
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,725
First, you want a dishwasher,

613
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,260
now you want this fucking cook?

614
01:20:49,551 --> 01:20:50,594
He's just...

615
01:20:50,606 --> 01:20:51,606
Shut up!

616
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:53,524
The cricket is on.

617
01:20:55,158 --> 01:20:56,985
And why you watch this shit TV?

618
01:20:57,587 --> 01:20:59,725
At least I am a millionaire.

619
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,726
Come on, I am hungry.
Make me a sandwich.

620
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:39,555
Come away with me.

621
01:21:40,989 --> 01:21:42,523
Away? Where?

622
01:21:44,157 --> 01:21:45,662
And live out what?

623
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:51,220
Love.

624
01:21:55,155 --> 01:21:56,756
Come away with me. Now.

625
01:22:13,014 --> 01:22:14,805
Salim will help us.

626
01:22:15,953 --> 01:22:16,953
Salim?

627
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:19,828
You still believe in Salim?

628
01:22:23,996 --> 01:22:26,811
Jamal,
I'll be gone soon anyway.

629
01:22:27,332 --> 01:22:29,261
We're getting out of Bombay.

630
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:32,619
Where?

631
01:22:33,154 --> 01:22:34,930
You think he'd tell me?

632
01:22:36,177 --> 01:22:38,100
No! No! No!

633
01:22:41,302 --> 01:22:42,500
Fuck.

634
01:22:58,153 --> 01:22:59,737
What is this shit?

635
01:23:01,438 --> 01:23:02,444
Get out!

636
01:23:02,957 --> 01:23:03,988
Get out!

637
01:23:07,078 --> 01:23:08,375
Motherfucker.

638
01:23:11,752 --> 01:23:14,019
Go, before he kills us both.

639
01:23:16,453 --> 01:23:18,051
You want to do something for me?

640
01:23:18,064 --> 01:23:19,086
Anything.

641
01:23:19,099 --> 01:23:20,353
Then forget me.

642
01:23:21,188 --> 01:23:22,414
What? No.

643
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:28,850
I will wait. The VT station.
5 O'clock, every day until you come.

644
01:23:33,185 --> 01:23:34,817
I love you.

645
01:23:36,353 --> 01:23:37,502
So what?

646
01:23:38,417 --> 01:23:40,966
It's too late, Jamal. Now go.

647
01:23:51,684 --> 01:23:52,748
So Jamal.

648
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:56,851
Which cricketer has scored the most
first class centuries in history?

649
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:12,649
But remember, if you answer wrong...

650
01:24:13,484 --> 01:24:14,942
you lose everything...

651
01:24:15,855 --> 01:24:17,162
just like this.

652
01:24:19,182 --> 01:24:21,283
So do you want to do this?

653
01:24:46,369 --> 01:24:48,448
Dreams of so many...

654
01:24:50,948 --> 01:24:52,420
on the floor.

655
01:26:11,618 --> 01:26:12,720
Latika.

656
01:26:16,618 --> 01:26:17,819
Latika.

657
01:26:26,619 --> 01:26:27,822
Latika.

658
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,520
Latika! Latika!!

659
01:26:46,521 --> 01:26:49,520
Jamal! Jamal!... Jamal!

660
01:27:20,423 --> 01:27:22,125
No Jamal!

661
01:27:24,024 --> 01:27:25,024
Latika!

662
01:27:28,626 --> 01:27:29,827
Latika!

663
01:27:30,426 --> 01:27:31,626
Latika!

664
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,939
Time for commercial break
ladies and gentlemen.

665
01:27:40,474 --> 01:27:43,640
I know, I know. I can't
stand the tension either.

666
01:27:43,876 --> 01:27:45,373
We'll be right back.

667
01:27:55,139 --> 01:27:56,966
Guy from the slums,

668
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,051
becomes a millionaire overnight.

669
01:28:01,173 --> 01:28:03,737
You know who's the only other
person who's done that?

670
01:28:05,171 --> 01:28:06,203
Me.

671
01:28:09,137 --> 01:28:11,104
I know what it feels like.

672
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:13,403
I know what you're being through.

673
01:28:14,136 --> 01:28:16,038
I'm not going to become a millionaire.

674
01:28:17,173 --> 01:28:19,354
I don't know the answer.

675
01:28:20,189 --> 01:28:22,264
You said that before, yeah...

676
01:28:22,698 --> 01:28:25,637
No really, this time I don't.

677
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:28,637
Come on, you can't take
the money and run now.

678
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:34,052
You are on the edge of history kid.

679
01:28:34,787 --> 01:28:36,663
I don't see what else I can do.

680
01:28:37,698 --> 01:28:39,400
Maybe it's written my friend.

681
01:28:41,136 --> 01:28:44,283
I don't know I just have
some kind of gut feeling,

682
01:28:44,596 --> 01:28:46,150
you're gonna win this.

683
01:28:46,172 --> 01:28:47,771
Trust me, Jamal.

684
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,288
You're gonna win.

685
01:29:23,134 --> 01:29:26,012
<i>Standby, everyone. We are on line in 13...</i>

686
01:29:26,048 --> 01:29:28,890
<i>Rakesh please give backup, man.</i>

687
01:29:30,021 --> 01:29:31,649
Yeah, he's gone. I'm just giving...

688
01:29:33,948 --> 01:29:35,282
Come fast.

689
01:29:36,132 --> 01:29:37,503
20 seconds!

690
01:29:43,132 --> 01:29:45,868
Do the right thing and in
approximately 3 minutes,

691
01:29:45,868 --> 01:29:47,426
you'll be as famous as me.

692
01:29:48,528 --> 01:29:49,797
<i>10 seconds!</i>

693
01:29:50,132 --> 01:29:52,194
And as rich as me.

694
01:29:54,507 --> 01:29:55,444
Almost.

695
01:29:55,766 --> 01:29:57,033
<i>5 seconds!</i>

696
01:29:57,247 --> 01:29:58,698
<i>4... 3...</i>

697
01:29:59,033 --> 01:30:00,939
From rags to Raja.

698
01:30:01,654 --> 01:30:02,663
It's your destiny.

699
01:30:02,664 --> 01:30:05,569
<i>We are on.
Applause and music please!</i>

700
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:16,668
Jugulu out, cut!

701
01:30:18,597 --> 01:30:21,798
Welcome back to
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"

702
01:30:22,332 --> 01:30:24,421
In the chair tonight is Jamal Malik,

703
01:30:25,235 --> 01:30:26,533
as if we don't know.

704
01:30:28,568 --> 01:30:30,347
<i>For 10 million rupees.</i>

705
01:30:31,682 --> 01:30:33,597
To question once again.

706
01:30:43,167 --> 01:30:45,329
No it isn't Sachin Tendulkar.

707
01:30:45,564 --> 01:30:46,796
That's a start.

708
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:52,030
So it could be Ricky Ponting,
Jack Hobbs or Michael Slater.

709
01:30:54,164 --> 01:30:55,961
I'll use a lifeline.

710
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:57,742
Fifty-fifty.

711
01:30:57,764 --> 01:30:58,795
Ok.

712
01:30:59,529 --> 01:31:01,729
Computer, take away the
two wrong answers please.

713
01:31:05,163 --> 01:31:07,948
Well, you were right
about Sachin Tendulkar.

714
01:31:08,381 --> 01:31:10,828
That leaves your fifty-fifty choice, Jamal.

715
01:31:11,162 --> 01:31:13,130
B: Ricky Ponting or D: Jack Hobbs.

716
01:31:15,164 --> 01:31:16,694
What do you think?

717
01:31:20,229 --> 01:31:21,328
Decision time.

718
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,140
For 10 million rupees.

719
01:31:25,162 --> 01:31:28,163
B: Ricky Ponting.

720
01:31:29,181 --> 01:31:31,679
Or D: Jack Hobbs.

721
01:31:45,163 --> 01:31:46,246
D.

722
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:54,192
Not B?

723
01:31:56,127 --> 01:32:00,527
The Ricky Ponting,
the Australian great cricketer?

724
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:05,626
D, Jack Hobbs.

725
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:07,292
You know?

726
01:32:11,127 --> 01:32:13,126
So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?

727
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:17,145
Or D, Jack Hobbs.

728
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:21,490
The final answer, D.

729
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:24,925
Computer-ji D...

730
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:27,238
D Lock.

731
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:29,559
D lock. Computer-ji D lock.

732
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:47,324
With 197 first class centuries,
the answer is...

733
01:32:51,659 --> 01:32:53,390
D, Jack Hobbs!

734
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:57,411
Jamal Malik!

735
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:00,225
Millionaire!

736
01:33:08,898 --> 01:33:11,398
Do the dance! Come on! Come on!

737
01:33:14,371 --> 01:33:15,627
Well done!

738
01:33:16,242 --> 01:33:17,333
Well done.

739
01:33:41,123 --> 01:33:44,822
So, are you ready for the final question?

740
01:33:45,157 --> 01:33:48,886
For 20 million rupees.

741
01:33:52,122 --> 01:33:53,171
No.

742
01:33:54,185 --> 01:33:57,335
But maybe it's written, no?

743
01:33:59,155 --> 01:34:00,386
Maybe.

744
01:34:02,122 --> 01:34:04,672
Okay. The final question!

745
01:34:05,186 --> 01:34:06,235
Who wants to be a...

746
01:34:11,957 --> 01:34:14,521
What a show ladies and gentlemen!
What a show!

747
01:34:15,157 --> 01:34:16,186
Join us tomorrow night,

748
01:34:16,422 --> 01:34:18,115
to see if Jamal Malik has made,

749
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:20,135
the biggest mistake of his life...

750
01:34:24,554 --> 01:34:25,837
This way.

751
01:34:33,371 --> 01:34:34,685
Great show.

752
01:34:38,618 --> 01:34:40,020
See you tomorrow ok.

753
01:34:40,154 --> 01:34:41,456
Be on time.
Yeah.

754
01:34:42,155 --> 01:34:43,155
Bye.

755
01:34:47,556 --> 01:34:48,957
Let's go!
Easy!

756
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:50,270
Easy!

757
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:53,470
No tricks!
What's going on?

758
01:35:00,118 --> 01:35:03,082
He's a cheat.
How do you know he's cheating?

759
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:07,368
Bloody village boy.

760
01:35:07,783 --> 01:35:10,634
I fed him the wrong answer,
and he never should call it right.

761
01:35:11,755 --> 01:35:13,182
You gave him an answer?

762
01:35:14,118 --> 01:35:15,217
Not exactly.

763
01:35:15,631 --> 01:35:17,247
Well that doesn't matter.

764
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,029
That's my show!

765
01:35:20,152 --> 01:35:21,752
My fucking show!

766
01:35:33,117 --> 01:35:35,747
It is a bizarrely plausible,

767
01:35:37,061 --> 01:35:38,073
and yet...

768
01:35:38,087 --> 01:35:39,184
Because,

769
01:35:39,197 --> 01:35:40,492
I'm a slumdog,

770
01:35:40,905 --> 01:35:42,216
a chaiwalla.

771
01:35:42,351 --> 01:35:43,734
I'm a liar right?

772
01:35:43,868 --> 01:35:45,082
Most of you are.

773
01:35:45,717 --> 01:35:48,716
But you are not a liar, Mr Malik.
That's for sure.

774
01:35:50,152 --> 01:35:51,515
You are too truthful.

775
01:35:55,150 --> 01:35:56,479
We're done.

776
01:36:00,613 --> 01:36:02,416
I don't know where they've taken her.

777
01:36:09,149 --> 01:36:10,551
Latika.

778
01:36:19,115 --> 01:36:22,314
I went on the show, because I
thought she'd be watching.

779
01:36:37,113 --> 01:36:42,112
<i>Did Jamal Malik, an uneducated 18 year
old boy from the slums of Mumbay,</i>

780
01:36:42,148 --> 01:36:46,078
<i>win one crore by fair
means or by foul play.</i>

781
01:36:46,113 --> 01:36:49,078
<i>And the crowd around me bears
an even bigger question:</i>

782
01:36:49,112 --> 01:36:53,212
<i>Will he be back tonight to play
for another 20 million rupees?</i>

783
01:36:55,216 --> 01:36:58,707
<i>Jamal Malik, a name which has
been in news in every town,</i>

784
01:36:58,721 --> 01:37:00,814
<i>neighbourhood, villages and homes.</i>

785
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,814
<i>18 year old Jamal Malik,</i>

786
01:37:02,828 --> 01:37:05,984
<i>is from Juhu Mumbai and
he's showing his elegance</i>

787
01:37:05,998 --> 01:37:08,939
<i>in the show
"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire".</i>

788
01:37:09,152 --> 01:37:15,516
<i>Jamal Malik has won 1 core rupees
and just one question away from...</i>

789
01:37:18,615 --> 01:37:20,417
Come on girls!

790
01:37:29,145 --> 01:37:30,911
Hey you come here, give me a kiss.

791
01:37:35,747 --> 01:37:36,975
Come on girls!

792
01:37:39,677 --> 01:37:41,478
Hey, move back.

793
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:59,509
<i>As if it wasn't enough drama in a
contestant reaching the final question,</i>

794
01:37:59,545 --> 01:38:04,307
<i>Jamal Malik was last night
arrested on suspicion of fraud.</i>

795
01:38:04,444 --> 01:38:05,769
That guy.

796
01:38:06,483 --> 01:38:07,764
He will never come.

797
01:38:09,578 --> 01:38:10,671
Ever.

798
01:38:13,144 --> 01:38:14,845
Crazy fucker.

799
01:38:22,444 --> 01:38:23,244
Go.

800
01:38:24,927 --> 01:38:25,728
Go.

801
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:27,073
But...

802
01:38:27,074 --> 01:38:28,095
Just drive.

803
01:38:29,309 --> 01:38:31,108
There won't be another chance.

804
01:38:36,743 --> 01:38:38,171
He will kill you.

805
01:38:38,172 --> 01:38:39,172
Yes ok.

806
01:38:43,109 --> 01:38:44,806
I'll take care of him.

807
01:38:50,144 --> 01:38:52,042
Salim, I can't.

808
01:38:55,859 --> 01:38:57,257
You have to.

809
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:07,117
God sake will take you out of this.

810
01:39:12,108 --> 01:39:13,671
Evil what I've done,

811
01:39:14,685 --> 01:39:16,220
please forgive me.

812
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:28,840
Have a good life.

813
01:40:00,105 --> 01:40:02,005
You're back on the show.

814
01:40:32,139 --> 01:40:33,139
Come on!

815
01:40:35,136 --> 01:40:36,137
Come on!

816
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,465
<i>The nation's gripped
with millionaire fever.</i>

817
01:41:16,099 --> 01:41:20,100
<i>As Jamal Malik, an uneducated young man
from the Juhu slum in Mumbay,</i>

<i>to see if he will make a one stage
further to 20 million rupees.</i>

822
01:41:38,201 --> 01:41:39,301
Come on!

823
01:42:01,134 --> 01:42:02,296
Where is everyone?

824
01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:03,932
Get back in there!

825
01:42:03,934 --> 01:42:05,597
Get back to work! Now.

826
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:10,033
Chaiwalla?

827
01:42:32,095 --> 01:42:35,997
Welcome back to
"Who wants to be a millionaire."

828
01:42:37,131 --> 01:42:39,060
I can safely say that tonight,

829
01:42:39,395 --> 01:42:42,561
is the biggest night of both our lives.

830
01:42:43,096 --> 01:42:45,694
<i>Jamal Malik, the call
assistant worker from Mumbay,</i>

831
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:48,060
<i>has already won 10 million.</i>

832
01:42:48,695 --> 01:42:50,846
<i>He can walk away with that
in his pocket or make,</i>

833
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:53,109
the biggest gamble in television history.

834
01:42:53,630 --> 01:42:55,359
Go for the final question,

835
01:42:55,595 --> 01:42:59,194
and a staggering 20 million rupees.

836
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:04,096
Are you ready for that question?

837
01:43:05,131 --> 01:43:07,470
Yes.
Jamal!

838
01:43:21,632 --> 01:43:22,923
<i>Big reader are you, Jamal?</i>

839
01:43:25,393 --> 01:43:26,860
I can read.

840
01:43:28,094 --> 01:43:29,458
Lucky.

841
01:43:48,127 --> 01:43:50,057
<i>A: Aramis.</i>

842
01:43:50,092 --> 01:43:54,095

C: D'Artagnan.

844
01:43:57,145 --> 01:43:59,559
Or D: Planchet.

845
01:43:59,659 --> 01:44:00,659
Porthos!

846
01:44:07,094 --> 01:44:10,292
Final question for 20 million
rupees and he is smiling.

847
01:44:10,426 --> 01:44:12,409
I guess you know the answer.

848
01:44:13,645 --> 01:44:15,891
Do you believe it, I don't.

849
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:18,657
You don't?

850
01:44:20,092 --> 01:44:23,292
<i>So you take the 10 million and walk?</i>

851
01:44:25,127 --> 01:44:26,208
No.

852
01:44:27,122 --> 01:44:28,269
<i>I'll play.</i>

853
01:44:31,091 --> 01:44:33,055
Let remind you, Jamal.

854
01:44:33,091 --> 01:44:35,590
If you get the answer wrong,

855
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:38,055
<i>you lose everything.</i>

856
01:44:39,091 --> 01:44:41,989
<i>10 million rupees, Jamal.</i>

857
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:45,456
<i>It's a fortune.</i>

858
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:49,489
I'd like to phone a friend.

859
01:44:51,425 --> 01:44:52,855
You're going to the wire.

860
01:44:54,091 --> 01:44:56,042
The final lifeline.

861
01:44:56,555 --> 01:44:57,903
Here we go.

862
01:45:05,123 --> 01:45:06,408
<i>It's ringing!</i>

863
01:45:12,443 --> 01:45:13,654
Who is it?

864
01:45:14,789 --> 01:45:16,552
That's my brother's number, but...

865
01:45:20,088 --> 01:45:24,588
The kind of brother, who go for a
walk on a 20 million rupee question?

866
01:45:26,122 --> 01:45:27,923
It's the only number I know.

867
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,840
You are on your own, Jamal.

868
01:46:02,021 --> 01:46:03,150
<i>Hello?</i>

869
01:46:07,386 --> 01:46:08,851
Hello, Jamal?

870
01:46:10,087 --> 01:46:12,886
I'm guessing that isn't your brother.

871
01:46:15,121 --> 01:46:16,452
This is...

872
01:46:17,087 --> 01:46:18,721
<i>My name is Latika.</i>

873
01:46:18,922 --> 01:46:20,149
Okay, Latika.

874
01:46:20,885 --> 01:46:22,747
You want to hear the
question one more time?

875
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:25,287
And let's be clear about this.

876
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:27,854
<i>20 million rupees right on your answer,</i>

877
01:46:27,854 --> 01:46:29,286
<i>you have 30 seconds.</i>

878
01:46:29,287 --> 01:46:30,287
Latika!

879
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,420
<i>Jamal.</i>

880
01:46:31,421 --> 01:46:34,885
Salim!
<i>Please read out the question to Latika now.</i>

881
01:46:38,921 --> 01:46:40,048
It is really you?

882
01:46:40,862 --> 01:46:41,682
Yes.

883
01:46:42,083 --> 01:46:43,650
The question, Jamal. The question!

884
01:46:45,086 --> 01:46:47,583
In Alexandre Dumas' book,
the "The Three Musketeers",

885
01:46:47,618 --> 01:46:50,083
two of the musketeers are
called Athos and Porthos.

886
01:46:50,119 --> 01:46:52,051
What was the name of the third Musketeer?

887
01:46:52,585 --> 01:46:53,774
Was it A:

888
01:46:53,887 --> 01:46:55,261
Aramis, B:

889
01:46:55,274 --> 01:46:57,274
<i>Cardinal Richelieu, C: D'Artagnan,</i>

890
01:46:57,287 --> 01:46:58,819
<i>D: Planchet?</i>

891
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,121
15 seconds!

892
01:47:01,636 --> 01:47:03,009
Where are you?

893
01:47:03,145 --> 01:47:04,614
I am safe.

894
01:47:05,149 --> 01:47:06,648
10 seconds!

895
01:47:07,381 --> 01:47:08,949
Latika, what do you think?

896
01:47:13,083 --> 01:47:14,500
I don't know.

897
01:47:16,913 --> 01:47:18,296
<i>I've never known.</i>

898
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:21,515
<i>Jamal, God will...</i>

899
01:47:30,582 --> 01:47:34,082
You really are on your own now, Jamal.

900
01:47:35,315 --> 01:47:39,118
Your final answer for 20 million rupees.

901
01:47:51,317 --> 01:47:52,317
A.

902
01:47:55,079 --> 01:47:56,845
A, because?

903
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,498
Just...

904
01:48:00,412 --> 01:48:01,493
because.

905
01:48:02,005 --> 01:48:03,046
Hey, Salim!

906
01:48:05,148 --> 01:48:06,948
You inside, you shameless Salim...

907
01:48:07,081 --> 01:48:08,346
Final answer?

908
01:48:09,247 --> 01:48:09,948
Latika!

909
01:48:10,579 --> 01:48:13,202
Yes, final answer. A,

910
01:48:14,216 --> 01:48:15,395
Aramis.

911
01:48:17,015 --> 01:48:18,716
Computer-ji, lock A.

912
01:48:27,315 --> 01:48:28,417
Jamal Malik,

913
01:48:28,430 --> 01:48:29,880
Salim! Salim!
Open the door! Salim!

914
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,679
Call centre assistant from Mumbay,

915
01:48:32,814 --> 01:48:33,945
chaiwalla,

916
01:48:35,079 --> 01:48:37,743
for two draws 20 million rupees.

917
01:48:38,979 --> 01:48:41,898
You were asked who
the third musketeer was,

918
01:48:41,911 --> 01:48:44,390
in novel by Alexander Dumas.

919
01:48:44,404 --> 01:48:45,945
You answered,

920
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:48,082
A,

921
01:48:48,395 --> 01:48:49,569
Aramis.

922
01:48:51,078 --> 01:48:53,979
Which is. I have to tell you.

923
01:48:55,715 --> 01:48:57,413
The right answer!

924
01:49:23,113 --> 01:49:24,493
Jamal Malik!

925
01:49:26,095 --> 01:49:27,694
Double millionaire!

926
01:49:30,529 --> 01:49:32,128
God is great.

927
01:49:38,738 --> 01:49:40,037
What a night!

928
01:52:12,569 --> 01:52:14,136
I knew you'd be watching.

929
01:52:15,569 --> 01:52:17,369
I thought we'd be together only in death.

930
01:53:03,601 --> 01:53:05,266
This is our destiny.

931
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,001
Kiss me.

932
01:53:26,024 --> 01:53:28,625
