1
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,376
Max?
- Uh-huh.

2
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,170
Ready to concede?

3
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,671
No.

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,230
I thought,
as it's your last night here,

5
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,650
it only appropriate that we open
something extra special.

6
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,236
- Bandol.
- Excellent choice.

7
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,824
Tempier Bandol, 1969.

8
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,369
The kind of wine that'll pickle
even the toughest of men.

9
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,957
I once saw a Castilian prizefighter

10
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:09,337
collapse in a heap
after drinking just a single glass.

11
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:13,674
Perhaps my knee
landing squarely in his testicles

12
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,637
may have been partly to blame.
What was I talking about before?

13
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,057
You said the importance of a good
blue suit can never be overstated.

14
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,475
Quite right.

15
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,686
A blue suit is the most versatile
of accouterments.

16
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:30,066
And more important than the suit itself,
is the man who fits it for you.

17
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,569
Once you find a good tailor,
you must never give his name away,

18
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,656
not even under the threat
of bodily harm.

19
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,580
Now, where were we?

20
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,415
- Whose turn is it?
- Mine.

21
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,583
Uh-huh.

22
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,130
Uh-huh.

23
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,301
Max, have I told you
why I enjoy making wine so much?

24
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,054
You don't make the wine,
that guy, Duflot, does.

25
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:04,517
In France it's always the landowner
who makes the wine,

26
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:08,187
even though he does nothing more
than supervise with binoculars

27
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,273
from the comfort of his study.

28
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,941
No, I enjoy making wine

29
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:17,446
because this sublime nectar is,
quite simply, incapable of lying.

30
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,949
Picked too early or picked too late,
it matters not.

31
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,077
The wine will always whisper
into your mouth

32
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:28,291
with complete, unabashed honesty
every time you take a sip.

33
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,629
Mm, delightful.

34
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,717
Now, Max-a-million, now you know why
I love wine so much,

35
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,261
have you anything
you want to tell me?

36
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,472
- Yes, I do.
- Yes, what is it?

37
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,062
Checkmate.

38
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,815
You little shit.

39
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,125
- Good morning, lab rats.
- Good morning, Max.

40
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,085
Today we're shifting gear.

41
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,755
Today is Greedy Bastard Day.

42
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:23,888
The secret to riches, lab rats,
is the same as the secret to comedy.

43
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,182
Timing.

44
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,020
115. 10, Max.
Feels like we should move now.

45
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,313
Now yet, Alf.

46
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,607
Boss, why do you keep calling me Alf?

47
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,443
Because you're
an aggressive little flunky, Kenny.

48
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,905
And as your boss, and genetic superior,
I can call you whatever I want.

49
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,825
- Max Skinner's phone.
- It's Kimberly.

50
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,285
- Is Max there?
- Yeah, one moment.

51
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,288
It's Kimberly.

52
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,584
- Sorry, Kimberly, Max isn't here.
- Where is he?

53
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,379
He and his fiancée
are at their wedding rehearsal today.

54
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,130
- What?
- You want to leave a message?

55
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,092
- No, I don't wanna leave him a message!
- Okay.

56
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,886
115.90.

57
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,181
116.00.

58
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,349
116. 10.

59
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,268
Right, lab rats, remember,
we're not here for the dental plan.

60
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,229
Fifty bid. People are buying.

61
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,397
Max?

62
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:15,898
Sell.

63
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,486
That's it! That's yours over there!
Yours over there! Keep selling it!

64
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,154
Sell that! That's yours!

65
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,366
Don't look at me! That's yours!

66
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,368
Don't look here,
the bonds over there!

67
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,668
That miserable sod. Skinner's
dumping bonds onto the market.

68
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,045
There's a gentlemen's
agreement on the exchange.

69
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,008
A gentlemen's agreement presupposes
there's a gentleman involved.

70
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,386
He put out 5 billion sell orders.
Prices are crashing through the floor!

71
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:50,891
Come on, people, get off your asses!
Come on, snap to it! Start selling! Sell!

72
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:59,525
They should bury you face down, Max.
Because that's the way you're going.

73
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,863
Maxie Boy, down!

74
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:08,743
Three big figures to 113.50!

75
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,954
- Sell! Sell!
- Still going down!

76
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,247
Buy.

77
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,291
Fucking buy it all back, Mickey Boy!

78
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,460
Buy it all back!
Immediately, buy it all back!

79
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,463
It's yours to buy back!
Don't worry about it! Buy it all back!

80
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,922
You're a genius, Max!

81
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,302
Filthy bugger.
He's forced down prices.

82
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,554
He's gonna buy everything back
on the cheap.

83
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:33,309
Start buying! Buying!
Now! Start buying!

84
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:40,399
For he's a jolly good fellow!

85
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,735
Which nobody can deny!

86
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,654
- Oh, I can!
- I can!

87
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,990
Well done today, lab rats.

88
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,243
Wonderful work. We all made
a spectacular amount of money.

89
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:56,290
Today we proved the adage
that winning isn't everything.

90
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,751
It's the only thing!

91
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,461
Yuck.

92
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,224
And there were strange
goings on the Bond Market today.

93
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,435
Prices crashed to 112.05

94
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,022
after Lawton Brothers unloaded
3 billion dollars in sell orders.

95
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,941
Then in an extraordinary move,

96
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,986
the company bought the bonds back
at a substantially reduced price,

97
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,240
making over $77,000,000
in the process.

98
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,576
Cries of foul play
were loud and widespread

99
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,496
with talks of an inquiry to follow.

100
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,791
- Morning, Mr. Skinner.
- Morning, Bert.

101
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,377
- And congratulations.
- Thank you.

102
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,462
You might have tipped me off,
Mr. Skinner.

103
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,300
I'll give you a tip, Bert.
Never pat a burning dog.

104
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,970
Wanker.

105
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,604
Oh, Henry. Bloody hell.

106
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,524
Ready for the fan mail?

107
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,443
Shoot, sunshine.

108
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,986
- "Bastard."
- Mm-hm.

109
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,613
- "Bastard."
- Uh-huh.

110
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,114
- "Burn in hell."
Right.

111
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,033
- "Rot in hell."
- Oh, lovely.

112
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,743
- "Die."
- Charming.

113
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:59,121
- Maxie?
- "Congratulations, you're my hero."

114
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,081
- Who sent that?
- Your lawyer.

115
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,333
- Right.
- Listen.

116
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,211
I just got off the phone with Auzet.

117
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,088
That's the notaire handling
your Uncle Henry's estate.

118
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,967
- She the one that sent me the letter?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:16,305
Anyway, listen,
seems that your Uncle Henry

120
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,683
hasn't updated
his will in over 20 years.

121
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:23,687
Which is why, in typical frog fashion,
they take over a month to notify us.

122
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,856
So, what do we do?
Is there a reading

123
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,275
or do we download
that sort of thing these days?

124
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,362
No, that's the point, Max.

125
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,572
Sorry?

126
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,574
- There is no legal will.
- Really?

127
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,495
You're his closest blood relative
so you get everything.

128
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,580
What, his clothes
and his Edmundo Ros LP's?

129
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,001
The house, you git.
You get to keep his house.

130
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,004
The old farmhouse,
and the vineyard and the grapes?

131
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,547
Must be worth a few quid.

132
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,010
- Ay.
- Hm.

133
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,679
- Anyway.
- Right.

134
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:01,267
I booked you a flight and an appointment
with Auzet for 3 tomorrow afternoon.

135
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,935
Just a few papers to sign.

136
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,979
Come on,
I can't go to France tomorrow.

137
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,275
I'm the toast of the town. I need to do
a few victory laps. Show off a bit.

138
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,776
Have a late night or two.

139
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,904
You heard the mail. It's times when
everyone hates you when it's fun.

140
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:18,242
Go on, Max. We'll take good care of the
place when you're gone. No problems.

141
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,370
Right. Ken.

142
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,081
Why don't you try and find
some small animals to hurt?

143
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,793
I know, find a poodle
and punt it off the balcony.

144
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,260
Mm.

145
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,553
- Tell me something, Max.
- Yes?

146
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,555
Did you care for him?

147
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,141
Yes, I did.

148
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,229
- When was the last time you spoke?
- A long time ago.

149
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,397
Why?

150
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,151
I don't know, probably got something
to do with me becoming an asshole.

151
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,904
Okay.

152
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,634
- Max.
- Hi. How are you?

153
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,887
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

154
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,598
Looking so much forward
to gloating through the room.

155
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,601
Well, follow me.

156
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,980
Tony. How are you?

157
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,024
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Austin.

158
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,692
Say hi to your dad for me.

159
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,445
- Love. How are you doing?
- Very well, how are you?

160
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,781
- Lucy.
- Hello.

161
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,283
I didn't realize that you two
knew each other. Whoops.

162
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,619
Adorable.

163
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,415
Magnificent bouquet.

164
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,085
Alluring nose of honey and spice.

165
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,252
And all things nice.

166
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:56,507
An inspection of the polyphenolics
reveals magnificent hues of brick red

167
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,842
indicative of a mature Bordeaux.

168
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,386
It's a Burgundy.

169
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,264
- Yes, I knew it was a Burgundy.
- Wine, sir?

170
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,726
I think I shall have an Eclipse.

171
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,144
Thank you.

172
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,648
Can we get our minds off
double-frontage, on French real estate?

173
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,317
- What do you think it's worth?
- Barely a day has passed

174
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:19,071
since you learned of the long-lost
uncle's departure from this world,

175
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,823
and all you can think of is money.

176
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,493
This same uncle is the man who taught
me every man needs a fuck-you million.

177
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,287
You gonna
furnish me with the particulars?

178
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,916
Because an estate agent needs
something he can sink his teeth into.

179
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:36,130
It's been a while since I've been there.
From memory, half a dozen bedrooms,

180
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,758
- pool, tennis court, decent kitchen.
- Thanks.

181
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,468
Eleven hectares vineyard.

182
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,763
Bloody hell, Max,
sounds like an estate to me. A chateau.

183
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,141
What's a chateau go for these days?

184
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,852
Well, we're obviously
in the f-you department, aren't we?

185
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,230
- Maybe several.
- Really? God bless Henry.

186
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,565
I won't cut my commission.

187
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,443
I wouldn't expect you to, Charles.
That's why I'm fond of you.

188
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,445
Well, in that case, Max,

189
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,197
here's to you.

190
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,147
Gemma.

191
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,505
- Yeah?
- Kenny?

192
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,256
I want the current 10-year yield.

193
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,092
I want an update on the figures
for non-farm payrolls.

194
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,554
And I want you to get your scrawny
little backside out of my chair.

195
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,098
Thank you.

196
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,560
How'd he know that?

197
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,609
Lance Armstrong!

198
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,712
Maxie! Hi, how are you?

199
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,341
Admit it. This is because I didn't
shag you at the Christmas party, isn't it?

200
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:48,595
Listen, I swear on my life, Max,
they didn't have any other cars.

201
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,640
So where are we, Max?

202
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,603
Bollocky sake!
I've gone to the end of that road.

203
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,814
Look! They're both the D-3.

204
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,316
I've got Ménerbes on my left,
Cavaillon on my right.

205
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,318
And they're both on the D-3.

206
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,781
- Shut up!
- Okay, hang on a minute, I'll help you.

207
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,118
I've got a GPS here
with a stutter and a...

208
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,328
Quite frankly, a shitty froggy attitude!

209
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,583
Okay, turn left and that'll take you
straight onto the N-7.

210
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,252
And if you really put your foot on it,

211
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,463
you might even get
to your appointment on time.

212
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,802
Bollocks! Bugger!

213
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,682
Mission control.

214
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,852
Right, love, please
reschedule my meeting with the notaire

215
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,104
- for first thing tomorrow morning.
- Okay.

216
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,981
What about the keys, Max?

217
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,610
Oh, there used to be a stone, you know?
By the front door.

218
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,655
Ask her to put the keys under the stone
and I'll pick them up from there.

219
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,699
Okay, copy that. Copy that.

220
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,446
Hello?

221
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,534
Henry?

222
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,394
Come on.
You're slower than your Aunt Midge.

223
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,398
That's it, Max-a-million.

224
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,276
It's not funny!

225
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,320
What are you? A man or a mouse?

226
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,739
Fine then. I'm a mouse.
Squeak, squeak.

227
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,212
Come on!

228
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,340
- Hopeless. You're hopeless.
- Oh, stop it.

229
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,189
Match point.

230
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,691
Ace!

231
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,653
- Game! Set! Match!
- You cannot be serious!

232
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,615
- Hey. Hey.
- You don't have to rub it in!

233
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,953
- The point is, why you aren't celebrating.
- Because I lost!

234
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,873
Well, a man should
acknowledge his losses

235
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,918
just as gracefully
as he celebrates his victories.

236
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,879
Come on, give us a jig.

237
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,589
- Give your uncle a jig!
- I lost!

238
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,009
- Arms up in triumph! Try harder! Focus!
- Yeah! Great! I lost!

239
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,637
- Uncle Henry won! Three cheers for him!
- Dance! Don't shimmy like an Italian.

240
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,016
Well done, Uncle Henry!
This is stupid!

241
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,646
You'll come to see that a man
learns nothing from winning.

242
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,066
The act of losing, however,
can elicit great wisdom.

243
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:39,696
Not least of which
is how much more enjoyable it is to win.

244
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,866
It's inevitable to lose now and again.

245
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:46,828
The trick is not to make a habit of it.

246
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,830
Drink?

247
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,310
Chicken shit.

248
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,978
Excuse me?

249
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,524
- On the roses.
- Oh, fertilizer.

250
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,318
Oh, Tati.

251
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,362
Hello.

252
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,906
Duflot?

253
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,491
- Max.
- My God!

254
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,494
Haven't you matured.

255
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:33,166
The floods of '78. Mistral of '86.

256
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,377
- Fanleaf disease in '93.
- Fanleaf disease.

257
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,881
With each vintage I've corked away
another year of my youth.

258
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,633
But I still have my wife, Ludivine.

259
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,009
- Ludivine.
- Yeah.

260
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,302
And my dog. Ha!

261
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,098
I expect you're hungry, no?

262
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,267
Please, come tonight.
My wife is roasting a lamb. Mm!

263
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:55,063
Tell the truth, I haven't had much
of an appetite since I learned of Henry.

264
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,233
In the very last years,
his sight was failing.

265
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,403
But I attended to things for him,
you know?

266
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,905
Became very close.

267
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,951
Almost like father and son.

268
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:12,914
Right. Well, I am most appreciative
that someone was here for him.

269
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,459
Well, my wife will come in the morning
with croissants. Okay?

270
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,461
She will resume her duties.

271
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,089
If you insist.

272
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,145
Hm.

273
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,274
"Welcome."

274
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,445
Well,

275
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,780
don't mind if I do.

276
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,581
Here's to you, Henry.

277
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,959
For devoting your life to the vines

278
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,670
and bottling the truth.

279
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,642
Well, that was honest.

280
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,645
Jesus. Should have
a "poison" sticker on it.

281
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,197
Coffee. Coffee.

282
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,785
What's in here? Here we are.
Okay. And...

283
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,369
Oh, bollocks.

284
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,505
Mm. Morning, Henry.

285
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,508
Milk.

286
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,355
- Maxie!
- Madame Duflot.

287
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,190
Maxie, Maxie, Maxie!

288
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,239
- Oh!
- Morning.

289
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,039
Ooh-loo-loo-loo-loo!

290
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,550
- Morning, Gemma.
- Are you enjoying yourself, Max?

291
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,051
Well, yes, as bereavements go.

292
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,553
This'll cheer you up.

293
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,513
You've been busted.

294
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,474
Morning Financial Times headline,

295
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,227
"Lawton Brothers Trade
Under Investigation."

296
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,146
You don't have to worry about that.

297
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,065
"The FSA today launched
an official inquiry

298
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,110
"into recent Lawton Brothers
trade activity."

299
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,154
I double-checked it all through Legal.

300
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,072
I covered our asses, okay?

301
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,449
It's just bollocks to placate
the Lustig Bank.

302
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,076
He doesn't think so.

303
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,413
- Nigel?
- Sir Nigel.

304
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:02,417
He wants a meeting with you today.
Five o'clock this afternoon.

305
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:06,421
It must be about something else. What
time is my meeting with the notaire?

306
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,423
A little over an hour from now.

307
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,216
My time or yours?

308
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,467
Oh, shit.

309
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,052
Oh, Gemma!

310
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,210
- Yes?
- How's the house?

311
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,837
Well, to tell you the truth,
it's a little shabby.

312
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,883
We don't say "shabby," we say
"filled with the patina of a bygone era."

313
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,968
- Right.
- How's the wine?

314
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,345
Bouquet of a wet dog.

315
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,766
Hits the palate like a razor blade
with a finish that hints of offal.

316
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:04,062
The house is falling apart, the vineyard
makes undrinkable wine. Excellent.

317
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,147
You are gonna need an oenologue.

318
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,150
- All right. What's that?
- It's a sort of licensed wine expert.

319
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,945
They take soil samples,
bits of the vine, test them.

320
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,738
There must be a couple near you.

321
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,325
And also, I would need a couple of sexy
snaps to get the punters clamoring,

322
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,495
and I have an e-mail address
for you to send them to, which is...

323
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,997
Hold on a second,
I'll just put you on speaker.

324
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,165
Okay, shoot.

325
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,168
Provence-listings@broadproperties.inc.

326
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,838
- Shit!
- Hello?

327
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,802
- Shit.
- Hello?

328
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,387
Oh!

329
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,181
- Max?
- Right. Go on.

330
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:07,959
Auzet?

331
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,215
Hello. Max Skinner.

332
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,342
The vigneron makes the wine

333
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,846
and the estate owner
maintains the property.

334
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,851
- Mr. Skinner?
- Yes? Right. Delightful.

335
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:30,315
This is how your uncle and Monsieur
Duflot worked for over 20 years.

336
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,985
Naturally Monsieur Duflot
will be anxious as to your intentions.

337
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,321
I think I can speed this up.

338
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,074
I have no intention
of becoming a wine maker.

339
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:46,831
So let Monsieur Duflot make the wine.
You enjoy the estate on the weekends.

340
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,125
I'm not sure you understand me.

341
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,712
My life is in London.
I don't do weekends.

342
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,506
I intend to sell La Siroque
as soon as possible.

343
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,217
And what about
Monsieur and Madame Duflot?

344
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,512
Look, in all cases like this,
it simply just comes down to a figure.

345
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,431
If there's nothing else, I have a plane.

346
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,060
Right.

347
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,037
You are selling La Siroque?

348
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,914
There has been a mistake, I think.

349
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,374
News travels fast.

350
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,254
But your uncle, he meant for you
to have it, not sell it.

351
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:39,258
I'm sure if he did, he would've written
that down in a proper will. He didn't.

352
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,011
You know, Henry was not
English the way you are.

353
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,765
He was a man of secrets, a man of
passion. He didn't write things down.

354
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,768
You would take me away
from my vines?

355
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,146
My vines, Duflot.

356
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:56,150
I live in them. I breathe in them.
They tear my hands.

357
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,821
Look, Francis,
when I sell the property,

358
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,031
I intend to make you
a handsome settlement.

359
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:06,494
Do you know, monsieur, what it is to
love something more than your own life?

360
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:10,998
To submit your days and nights
to the fickle will of nature?

361
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,334
I have only a few vintages left.

362
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,337
Soon my body and spirit
will be defeated by the terroir.

363
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:21,008
And you dare come here and take away
my last few chances of immortality!

364
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,136
Afraid so. Be in touch.

365
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,306
It's not over!

366
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,356
- Leaving now.
- Oh, good.

367
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,692
Because Sir Nigel
has made a special trip.

368
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,694
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

369
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:42,363
Good. Did you remember to take
the photos for Charlie?

370
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,366
Yes. Damn it!

371
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,285
Idiot.

372
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,089
Let's see you, then!

373
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,341
One!

374
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,678
Two! Hooray!

375
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,952
- Yes?
- Get in the car.

376
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,079
Get off my camera!

377
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,087
Bollocks!

378
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,316
Oh, come on.

379
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,026
Where's the ladder?

380
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,363
Where are you, you tosser?

381
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:33,909
Come on!

382
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,331
Come to Papa. Come to Papa.

383
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,133
Gemma, for God's sake, keep calling!

384
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:05,816
Hello.

385
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,069
No, don't worry about me.

386
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,782
I'm the pool man. I do this every
Thursday. It's just routine maintenance.

387
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,204
This is lovely chatting to you.

388
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,213
And you are a spectacular vision.

389
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,925
But any chance
for a rope or a ladder?

390
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,220
Is that your little car?

391
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:38,516
Yes, I'm a temporary custodian
of the lime-green roller skate,

392
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:42,019
but it's a hired car. It's a rental,
it's not for sale. Sorry? What?

393
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,814
- Can you swim?
- Well, yes. But not in a foot of cow shit.

394
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,069
Hello?

395
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,460
He's not on the flight.

396
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:10,923
Right. Right. Okay, roger that.

397
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:43,247
"What is it, Major Lawrence, that
attracts you personally to the desert?"

398
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:49,170
"It's clean.
I like it because it's clean."

399
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,796
You better be in prison, Maxie.

400
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,050
Yes, tell him I'm sorry.
There's nothing I could do about it.

401
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,469
Sorry's no good, Max. He's gone.

402
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,763
Oh, shit.

403
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,809
- What time is the first morning flight?
- Oh, there's no point in rushing back.

404
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,271
You know, the last thing Sir Nigel did
on his way out

405
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,899
- was to suspend you for a week.
- What?

406
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,693
What the... does he expect me
to do for a week?

407
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,320
Take a holiday.

408
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,240
- Christ, he didn't say that, did he?
- No, I just did.

409
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,283
Right. Gemma, never say that.

410
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:04,245
If anybody calls,
do not say I'm on holiday.

411
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,455
All right? That's worse than dying.

412
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,208
Now, look, I'll be back in the office
in a couple of days.

413
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,670
- Okay.
- Make sure every man in there is ready.

414
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,923
Set it up
so I can trade in Kenny's name.

415
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,260
Get him a clearance at the highest level
on Sir Nigel's recommend.

416
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,844
Are you mad, Max?

417
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,097
Who cares? Just do it.
And don't tell anybody.

418
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,849
All right?
Especially not that little shit Kenny.

419
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,561
- Max, is there a problem?
- No, I'm having a great time.

420
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,728
- You sure?
- Yes.

421
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,605
- Well, you just be careful, okay?
- Yep.

422
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,900
- Okay, ciao.
- Bye.

423
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,754
Oh, shit! Shit! Scorpion! Ludivine!

424
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,756
Scorpion!

425
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,132
Scorpion!

426
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,343
Oh, Scorpion! Bloody hell!

427
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,678
Get that little bastard!

428
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,976
- Of course.
- Okay.

429
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,377
- That fits very well. Beautifully.
- Max?

430
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,170
Are you back in blighty?

431
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,005
On the contrary, chuckles.

432
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:23,217
I've decided to stick around
for a couple of days.

433
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,302
So it's true, you are getting the sack.

434
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,390
No, I'm not getting the sack, Charlie.
I'm just exploring my options.

435
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,059
With a view to realizing
the potential of my inheritance.

436
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,104
Well, speaking of your inheritance,
how soon before we can view?

437
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:40,234
It's cosmetic stuff mostly, I'd say. It's
surprising how well it's been maintained.

438
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,277
So you don't need a contractor
or anything?

439
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:47,199
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Just needs
a coat of paint and a bit of a scrub.

440
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,409
Okay, you sure?

441
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,286
- No problem at all, Charlie.
- Good.

442
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,831
Charlie?

443
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,668
- Charlie, can you hear me?
- Yes.

444
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,795
- Can you hear me now?
- Yes.

445
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,507
Look, I wasn't joking before about what
I said about the wine they make here.

446
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:07,803
It is not, I repeat, not first-class.

447
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,764
- Will that affect our price?
- How bad can it be?

448
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,892
Well, it gives you a blinding headache
and it makes you angry.

449
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,729
I can't imagine the damage
a second sip might do.

450
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,482
Well, we just have to make sure our
buyers don't know anything about wine.

451
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,277
We'll concentrate on the Americans.

452
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,196
Just make sure she's match fit
in 72 hours.

453
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,949
Seventy-two hours. Righto.

454
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,747
A Lamborghini tractor.

455
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,457
Paintbrush, paintbrush, paintbrush.

456
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,630
Paintbrush.

457
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,228
You old bugger.

458
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,469
Duflot.

459
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,182
I was just about to use
that paintbrush.

460
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,517
It's my paintbrush.

461
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,311
Gee whiz, this is fun.

462
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,941
Tell you what, I'll give you 20 euros
for your paintbrush.

463
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:46,193
Hm? No?

464
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,612
Fifty.

465
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,115
I'll give you 100 for your paintbrush.
I don't care. What do you want?

466
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,956
When you sell, I stay vigneron.
I keep my vines.

467
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,707
You want to stay with your vines?

468
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:05,170
Fine. That means you must help me
fix the place up.

469
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:08,048
Do the gardens, paint the house,
clean the pool.

470
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,926
And I, if at all possible,

471
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,928
will attempt
to convince the new owners

472
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,430
of the worth and value
of your services.

473
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,311
A Frenchman's hand is his word.

474
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,190
An Englishman's word is his bond.

475
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,151
Deal.

476
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,779
- Frog tosspot.
- English prick.

477
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,005
Awfully sorry.

478
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,217
Goal, Angleterre.

479
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:55,238
- Bat. Come on.
- Skinner coming up to bowl!

480
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,823
How's that?

481
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,367
Second of the over.

482
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,039
- Best play.
- Come on!

483
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,461
All right, I'm 12 and I'm out.

484
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,674
Okay.

485
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,263
It won't last one month.

486
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:24,685
If things go according to plan, Francis,
it'll be somebody else's problem.

487
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,983
- Monsieur Max.
- Yes?

488
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:35,153
There is a person.

489
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,321
At the door.

490
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,156
- Person?
- A person!

491
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,420
The only country that issues
teeth like that is America.

492
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,340
- You speak English.
- Like a native.

493
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:58,760
I'm Christie Roberts.
I'm looking for Mr. Skinner.

494
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,304
You lucky devil. You found him.

495
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,975
Impossible. You're way too young.

496
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,395
You know, I was just thinking
the same thing about you.

497
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,731
I meant too young to be my dad.

498
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,153
Henry Skinner's my father.

499
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,115
She has Henry's nose.

500
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,287
Wow.

501
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:31,752
- This your mum?
- In all her Flashdance glory.

502
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,757
So is he around?

503
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,178
Oh, bollocks. Um...

504
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,893
- Sorry, I've forgotten your name.
- It's Christie.

505
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,520
You see, Christie,

506
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,981
Henry...

507
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:59,071
- He's dead, huh?
- A month ago.

508
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,206
Cup of tea? Yes?

509
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,334
Madame Duflot.

510
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,295
It's more than a wrinkle.
What if the girl turns out to be legit?

511
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,340
Oh, come on, she turns up
a couple months after he carks it?

512
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,050
It's too sweet. I'm not buying.

513
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:25,138
You need legal advice fast, in case
the little minx screws up the whole deal.

514
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,598
Asking price?

515
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,476
It's seven and a half.
Did you get that?

516
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,687
Right.

517
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,486
Christie,
I've just got to pop into town.

518
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:44,157
No problem. I booked a youth hostel
just in case the old man was schizo.

519
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:50,455
You mind dropping me off?
I really gotta get out of these clothes.

520
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,582
Why don't you get out
of your clothes here?

521
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,627
Got plenty of space. Lots of room.
You can clean up, take a shower.

522
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,838
- I'll be back in a jiff.
- You sure?

523
00:45:58,548 --> 00:45:59,881
Absolutely, absolutely.
Madame Duflot?

524
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,303
Voilà.

525
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,433
Under French law
there is no difference

526
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,769
between legitimate
and illegitimate children

527
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:15,730
when it comes to the right
to inherit.

528
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:18,942
Well, that's bloody ridiculous.
She never even met Henry.

529
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,610
She could very well be
an imposter.

530
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:26,074
That is precisely why she'd be required
to produce some form of documentation.

531
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:30,370
A photo or even correspondence,
a love letter.

532
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,748
Yes, yes, yes.
But what if I just sell the property

533
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,002
before she makes her claim?

534
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,797
No. Legally she could
invalidate the sale

535
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,674
even after the transfer of title.

536
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:43,842
Bugger.

537
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:48,054
My advice, Mr. Skinner,
is to treat her with the utmost respect.

538
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,806
That goes without saying.

539
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,350
And hope she'll be on her way.

540
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,186
Oh, yeah, hope she'll bugger off.

541
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,355
Don't let this end in court.

542
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,182
Joan of Arc?

543
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,853
Oh. Jacques Cousteau.

544
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:38,438
You tried to drown me.

545
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,274
And you tried to run me over
with your little car.

546
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:44,194
What are you talking about?
What sort of bollocks is that?

547
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,781
Down the road from La Siroque you were
driving your midget car on your phone.

548
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,162
And, I believe, had your head stuck
very far up your ass!

549
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,790
Look at the damage
you have caused me.

550
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,418
You try to kill me, I try to kill you!

551
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,550
My God.

552
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,427
She's fantastic.

553
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,182
Coming along. All right.

554
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,851
Hey, Max.

555
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:21,106
Look at the view. It's like Cézanne.

556
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,380
Francis?

557
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,633
In town today,

558
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:54,639
- I was passing by this restaurant...
- Her name is Fanny Chenal.

559
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:01,062
Many times I've seen
the same look on your uncle's face.

560
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,357
- But you deserve credit.
- Why's that?

561
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,902
You are now the town hero
for making her show her derrière.

562
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,910
She grew up around here, didn't she?

563
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,329
Who?

564
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,417
- Fanny Chenal.
- Oh, I believe. Yes.

565
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,878
Is she...

566
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,797
Is she otherwise spoken for?

567
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,050
She was once.

568
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:34,054
A football player for Lyons.
He was shit.

569
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,638
Just like his left foot.

570
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,141
He treated her very badly, you know?

571
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:43,229
Since then, it's rumored that
she will let no man near her heart.

572
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,159
So she's alone, then.

573
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,621
- Who?
- Fanny Chenal.

574
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:02,415
Max, recall what Proust said,

575
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,836
"Leave pretty women
to men without imagination."

576
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,546
Duflot, I'm a banker.

577
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,799
I have no imagination.

578
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,550
Stop.

579
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,598
Fred Perry.

580
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,227
René Lacoste.

581
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,201
- Ugh!
- Love-15.

582
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,456
Fifteen all.

583
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,421
Yes! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

584
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,091
No, no. Out.

585
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,552
You cannot be serious!
That was in by a mile!

586
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,512
Ball. Ball!

587
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,600
Good!

588
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,776
Bollocks!

589
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,462
My point?

590
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,558
Match point!

591
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:54,861
- Game.
- Mm.

592
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,698
Whoo.

593
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,877
Voilà.

594
00:52:56,632 --> 00:53:00,843
- Oh, Maxie!
- Oh, look, Ludivine,

595
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:05,765
she's my cousin. Well, she might be.
Could end up turning out to be relative.

596
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,102
From a cousinly perspective,
this is perhaps little over the top?

597
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:13,815
No. Half the aristocrats in France
have a liaison with their cousins.

598
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,275
Gosh, that explains a lot.

599
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,490
Oh, won't do.

600
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,703
Anything but La Siroque.

601
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,251
No label. That looks promising.

602
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,798
Careful on those steps.

603
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,470
What do you see up there?

604
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,641
Are you speaking in tongues, boy?

605
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:53,062
Fervere. It's a Latin term.
It means "to boil."

606
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:55,690
The native yeasts in your cellar

607
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:59,152
are converting the sugar
inside the grapes to alcohol.

608
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:03,823
The release of carbon dioxide gas
is what causes the bubbling effect.

609
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:07,702
I must be suffering from dementia. I
don't recall ever having taught you that.

610
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,456
You didn't.
Monsieur Duflot explained it to me.

611
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,042
Well done.

612
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:18,588
Proves the adage that wisdom
can be found in the most unlikely places.

613
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:24,093
To watch Duflot on bended knee doing
something as simple as weeding soil,

614
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:29,432
he brings a magnificent poetry
in his devotion to each and every grape.

615
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:33,061
Perhaps he'll inspire you

616
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,688
to find devotion
in what you do for a living one day.

617
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,860
I wanna be a professional poker player
when I'm older. Or a comedian.

618
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,195
Max-a-million,

619
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:47,617
ask me what is the most
important thing in comedy.

620
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,661
What is the most important thing
in com...

621
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:51,788
Timing.

622
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,543
Timing.

623
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,341
Have you tasted Dad's wine?

624
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,052
Oh, yes, indeed.
Bloody awful, isn't it?

625
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,639
But I recommend it for getting the paint
out from underneath your fingernails.

626
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:10,973
So you know.

627
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,394
Well, I'm more of a cognac drinker.
I'm too impatient to be a wine lover.

628
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,105
If I'm gonna get drunk,
I don't spend all night doing it.

629
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,190
Try that.

630
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,069
That's better.

631
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,780
It's extraordinary.

632
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,241
Like a Bordeaux,
only velvet rather than wool.

633
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:31,911
Well, well, guess who knows
a thing or two about wine.

634
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,790
Back in Napa, we're known
to gargle and spit on occasion.

635
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,084
That sounds like fun.

636
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:42,922
Is this made here? On the estate?

637
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,298
"Coin Perdu."

638
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,842
Doubt it.

639
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,886
Different bottles, same corks.

640
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,433
Well, Henry always was
a little bit of a mystery.

641
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:54,892
How so?

642
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,062
Well, he loved England,
but he lived in France.

643
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,022
And he loved women,

644
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:04,944
but never the same one
for more than a certain period of time.

645
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,029
He never got married.

646
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:10,032
And he loved adventure,
but every single one of my memories

647
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:14,245
takes place within about 100 steps
of this very spot.

648
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,289
Are they good memories?

649
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,499
No.

650
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,461
They're grand.

651
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,592
I'm gonna go upstairs.
Go finish my book.

652
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,471
Death in Venice. That's my book.

653
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,307
Don't tell me the ending.

654
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,106
Well, actually, I never got around
to finishing it.

655
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,609
Hello, old mate, how are you?

656
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,943
Just a quick question.

657
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,571
Yeah, hang on. Shirley.

658
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,074
- Yes?
- You'd know this.

659
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:55,995
In France, is it actually illegal
to shag your own cousin?

660
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,999
- Only if she's ugly.
- Right.

661
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,172
Bollocks.

662
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,927
Lance Armstrong!

663
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,765
You must be kidding!
I called up before.

664
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:19,352
- I know. I'm so sorry!
- I'm supposed to be here for 7:30.

665
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,938
- How long is it?
- Thirty minutes. I'm sorry.

666
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:24,357
- Oh, come on.
- I know. I know.

667
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,109
You said we'd be seated right away.

668
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,779
I know. Okay. You have a drink...

669
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:34,617
Olé will offer you a drink and you'll have
your table in less than 20 minutes.

670
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:38,538
All right, what I want is...
Get ready, write it down, double mai tai.

671
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,627
Caroline.

672
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:58,140
I hope your food's wonderful
because your service is lousy.

673
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,601
- Please, I'm too busy to ignore you.
- Where are all your waiters, love?

674
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:04,021
My hands are full
without games with you.

675
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,150
McDonald's is in Avignon.
Fish and chips in Marseilles.

676
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,703
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry. Done this before.

677
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,579
- Where?
- Worked through university

678
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,998
at London restaurants.

679
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,673
Okay. Okay, you can serve.

680
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:35,303
Remember, if there are any complaints,
in France, the customer is always wrong.

681
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,596
Table six.

682
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,196
Uh...

683
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,407
Sixteen.

684
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,001
Cheers. And what are we
gonna have here?

685
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:10,046
Garcon. Garcon, get over here.
I need help over here.

686
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,591
Where you going? Damn. Garcon!

687
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:18,554
Do you speak American? This menu is all
in French and we don't understand this.

688
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,973
But let me tell you
what I would like to have.

689
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:25,519
I would like a salad Niçoise-a
with ranch dressing on it.

690
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,146
Baby, lo-cal ranch dressing.

691
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:31,484
That's right, I'm still on my diet. I would
like lo-cal ranch dressing with no oil.

692
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,070
And could you sprinkle
some bacon bits on top?

693
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:38,324
McDonald's is in Avignon.
Fish and chips, Marseilles.

694
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,701
You people got some
serious attitude here.

695
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,011
Here are your tips.

696
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,223
Thank you for your help. You're fired.

697
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,190
You know, my vigneron
said that you grew up around Gordes.

698
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,359
Monsieur Duflot is mistaken.

699
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,445
I only visited Gordes
during the summer with my mother.

700
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,948
I used to spend my summers here.

701
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:20,866
I wonder if we ever met.

702
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:28,624
Well, if we did,
I hope I was unbearable.

703
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,753
You're a local,
you'd know the answer to this.

704
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:37,425
Where would a young man,
recently cashed-up,

705
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:40,261
take someone for a drink?

706
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,638
What?

707
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,182
Are you asking me on a date?

708
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,896
No, it's more of an apology.

709
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,357
I don't want you to think
I'm the sort of maniac

710
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:55,484
who goes around
running people off the road.

711
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,528
I'm not interested.

712
01:00:58,572 --> 01:00:59,780
Have a good night.

713
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:39,695
Sunday night, 8:00,
Place de l'Etang. Don't be late.

714
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,447
I shall see you there.

715
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,205
Oh, my God!

716
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:53,042
Help! Scorpions! Scorpions! Help!

717
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,461
Oh, my God!

718
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,156
You're welcome!

719
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,605
You dance very well, Ludivine.

720
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,816
Thank you.

721
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,110
I miss Henry.

722
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,861
He was an excellent dancer.

723
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,033
Do you wanna dance?

724
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:11,370
- Oh, what happened?
- The tennis with Francis.

725
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,621
Oh, poor boy.

726
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:14,748
- Do you want me to put a bandage?
- No.

727
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,792
- Antiseptic?
- No.

728
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,043
Oh.

729
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,422
You are coming to our house tonight.

730
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,882
To our home.

731
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,388
I am cooking for you, Max.

732
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,592
Francis Duflot, vigneron.

733
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,929
Christie Roberts, illegitimate daughter.

734
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:16,060
The resemblance to Henry
is unmistakable. The nose.

735
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:20,814
For 23 years,
I toiled side by side with your father.

736
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:24,943
Even now he works from there
and I from here.

737
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:30,115
That's when I first planted the vines.
But now they are sad and tired.

738
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,492
Except here.

739
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,119
Here? No. It's catastrophic.

740
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:37,289
Nothing but rocks and grief.

741
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,792
Limestones absorb the sunlight.

742
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,877
Keep the vines warm at night.

743
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:49,343
Wine brat. Spent summers working
in a vineyard in California.

744
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:52,638
In California they don't make wine,
they make Hawaiian punch.

745
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,432
Mondavi might argue with that one.

746
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:59,937
Maybe Henry's daughter would be
interested in a personal tour in the vines.

747
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:03,857
If we are lucky, his spirit will join us.

748
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,376
Pay to the order of François Hupert,
the plumber?

749
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,546
- How much?
- Eighty-seven francs.

750
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,966
Mm. Sign.

751
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,969
Henry Skinner.

752
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,055
- Next?
- The mechanic.

753
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,099
Not a sou to that grease monkey.

754
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,144
The old Jag's still coughing
like your Aunt Midge.

755
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:44,273
- Next?
- Jean-Pierre Lesourd.

756
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,900
- How much, how much?
- Two thousand francs.

757
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,902
Yes, okay, okay.

758
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,407
You're a genius, Max-a-million.

759
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:55,325
You could be me. Ha!

760
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,288
- The photos worked like a charm.
- Really?

761
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,039
- Massive interest, Max.
- Wonderful.

762
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,876
Yes. Money, money,
money, money, money.

763
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,171
So I decided it's time I was on-site.

764
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:10,048
So I booked a flight.
I'll be with you tomorrow afternoon.

765
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:14,136
Terrific. Well, I'll alert the staff
and chain up the dogs.

766
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,596
"Chain up the dogs"?

767
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:20,142
No, I don't have any dogs, Charlie,
it's a figure of speech, right? Okay, bye.

768
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:47,711
Max.

769
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,381
Pretty cool, huh?

770
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,093
Huh?

771
01:06:56,596 --> 01:07:00,349
- We must have an apéro.
- We must have a big one. Look at that.

772
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,523
Ludivine.

773
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:11,944
Maxie.

774
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,362
Hello.

775
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,410
Of course.

776
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:30,337
Ah. I took the liberty of inviting
Henry's daughter to join us.

777
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:36,176
Pastis?

778
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,720
Bonsoir, cuz.

779
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,643
I see you've managed
to ingratiate yourself with the help.

780
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:49,398
- Where'd you get the Halston?
- Dad's closet.

781
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:50,691
Ta-da.

782
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,568
I wonder what she wore home.

783
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,530
A simple meal after a day's work
in the fields.

784
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,741
Eggplant. Caviar d'aubergine.
Very good.

785
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,034
Headless larks.

786
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:04,037
Where are the heads? We didn't, like,
eat them already, did we?

787
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:08,166
Mushrooms of the region.

788
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,837
And finally civet of wild boar.

789
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,549
Marinated in red wine
and blood pressed from the carcass.

790
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,050
Why have it any other way?

791
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:21,555
Ludivine, help, help.

792
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,349
Wine, Max? La Siroque.

793
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,312
- Christie? Wine?
- No, I'm okay.

794
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,442
Oh! Papa.

795
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,697
Papa speaks Provençal. You know?

796
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,450
Oh, but very few still understand it.

797
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:46,121
It's now exclusively practiced
by poets and sodomites.

798
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,957
What a sodomite is, by the way?

799
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,543
I will explain you tonight.

800
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,338
Francis.

801
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,384
The asparagus is lovely.

802
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:02,721
- Thank you.
- Very chewy,

803
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:04,473
but lovely.

804
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:10,395
And the boar.
Well, perhaps the best boar I've had.

805
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:13,231
- Can I have some bread, please?
- Oh, yeah.

806
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,077
Sorry for this.

807
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,664
C'est Le Coin Perdu.
It's a local vin garage.

808
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:32,376
It's a garage wine.
Like a boutique wine.

809
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:37,255
Small vineyards, small productions.
Seriously big prices.

810
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,132
It's overrated, huh?

811
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:44,763
Didn't say that on the Web. Turns out
Le Coin Perdu is a Provençal legend.

812
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,724
Changes hands among collectors,
nobody knows who makes it.

813
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,645
Well, it's time for fromage. Okay?

814
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,980
You want fromage? Cheese?

815
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,694
And now... Now...

816
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:01,905
Papa. Papa.
Trouble you for a spot of the grog?

817
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:05,867
You know what it is, Christie?
It is Marc de Provence. I made it myself.

818
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:10,288
It's a little bit strong, but very good.

819
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,874
- Chin-chin.
- It's your father's recipe.

820
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,044
Yes. Max. Little bit?

821
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:22,259
Tell us, Madame Duflot, what makes
you so certain she is Henry's child?

822
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:25,303
Oh, but of course. The nose!

823
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:30,475
Oh, the nose! The glorious snout!
The prominent proboscis!

824
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,644
There something else? Anything?

825
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:36,982
No? Anything that might help
corroborate Christie's claim?

826
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:42,237
Henry ever discuss California?

827
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,491
Did he mention
a woman in California?

828
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:53,874
Funny. Any moments of drunken candor
where he might have mentioned

829
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,042
offspring? No?

830
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,670
I mean, seriously.

831
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:02,174
The last person Henry would ever
breed with would be an American.

832
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:08,096
Yes, but, in this moment, I see more
of Henry in Christie than I do in you.

833
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,765
Yes, yes.

834
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:13,810
Max. All I want
is to learn about my father.

835
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,022
This is my chance
to find out who made me

836
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,567
and I don't care
if you believe me or not.

837
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:35,540
Monsieur, Madame, Papa Duflot,
thanks for a lovely evening.

838
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,710
- Papa will walk you back.
- Oh, no, Ludivine. No.

839
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,797
The vines will guide me.

840
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:47,469
- Good night.
- It's okay?

841
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,554
I'm okay. Whoo!

842
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:17,040
- What're you doing?
- I lost my shoe.

843
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,126
- What?
- I lost my shoe.

844
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:23,380
Why can't Henry be my dad?

845
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:27,008
Because now that he's back in my life,
I'm not sure that I want to share him.

846
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:30,762
- You don't believe me, do you?
- Look, Christie, it's not a matter of that.

847
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:35,141
Ludivine told me that your
parents died when you were young.

848
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:39,646
You know,
I grew up without a dad too.

849
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:44,609
Doesn't it matter to you that I may be
the only blood relative you have?

850
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,196
Yes, it does.
That's why I need to be sure.

851
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,492
Right.

852
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,624
Whoa!

853
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,767
This was my room
when I was a little boy.

854
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,480
Sleeping here,

855
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,317
it was the safest place in the world.

856
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:29,446
No bedtimes, no chores.

857
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,282
No squabbling adults.

858
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:36,995
I loved Henry deeply
but I never got around to telling him.

859
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:40,373
It's a shitty feeling.

860
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:47,672
Those summers saved my life.

861
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,766
Thanks a million, Max-a-million.

862
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,730
Bloody hell, Henry.

863
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,358
Well, where does it come back in?

864
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:08,026
Bugger cooked the books.

865
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,787
- Yes?
- Max, my boy.

866
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,705
Amis, you old cheese.

867
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,166
So sorry to hear you're out.

868
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:27,170
Well, as usual, the only thing right
about your intelligence is it's all wrong.

869
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:29,381
You always were
at the back of the conga line.

870
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,217
You've crossed the line
one too many times, Skinner.

871
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,219
- You little runt!
- By the by,

872
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:39,891
thank you so much for your generous
contribution to my Aston Martin fund.

873
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,059
Did you get the flowers?

874
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:43,061
What flowers?
What you talking about?

875
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,480
- All of your little schemes and ploys.
- Do go on.

876
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,400
- Well, you're nothing.
- Plonker.

877
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,110
Oi, I heard that.

878
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:53,405
Who you calling a plonker,
you fat prat?

879
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,073
Hey? Hello?

880
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,744
Hello. I am Jean-Marie Brunier.

881
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,956
- Yes?
- I've come to test the vines.

882
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,041
Oh, the oenologue! Right. Great.

883
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:08,128
Well, grab your boots, off we go.

884
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,803
- Gemma, long time.
- Max,

885
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:22,225
I've just had a vision of you
serving Kenny a latte at Starbucks.

886
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,145
- Getting comfortable in my chair, is he?
- Yeah, listen.

887
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:29,941
Remember, we are not here
for the dental plan.

888
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,818
Sell. Sell.

889
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,863
He's even taken credit
for your trade this week.

890
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:40,285
He's telling everyone in the office that
he was the one that gave you the idea.

891
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:42,871
If he wasn't
an ambitious and mercenary bastard,

892
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,789
I never would've given him the job.

893
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:47,292
Yeah, but Max,
he's really trying to take your job.

894
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,629
Just give him his head and let him do
what he needs to do. All right?

895
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,012
Well?

896
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:03,683
- Wonderful. Wonderful.
- No. No, it's mean...

897
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:08,396
It's bad, you know? Yeah. Shit.

898
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:13,902
Chicken shit, non?

899
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,491
Is very terrible this one.
You know, it's like...

900
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:23,536
In French we say mort.
It's completely dead.

901
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,914
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

902
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:29,167
Look at this one. This is a little baby.
This is a baby.

903
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,169
Look at.

904
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,171
I test this one.

905
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:42,222
Very, very bad. I'm really sorry.

906
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:53,316
More like a quarry than a vineyard.

907
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:54,901
Look at this. Know what mean?

908
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:59,364
You cut off
two of every three branches,

909
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,450
what's left gets all
the nourishment, no?

910
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:04,744
Why would you do that?

911
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:09,499
Perhaps a peasant's last attempt
to salvage what he could, no?

912
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,756
Right, I think I follow you.

913
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,883
So what's the verdict?

914
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:23,805
Despite your vigneron's
admirable efforts, no?

915
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:27,016
This terroir is beyond help.

916
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,936
Nothing.

917
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,564
Shit. Nothing, no.

918
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:37,569
You might consider
growing potatoes or squash.

919
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:43,700
I will have my office
send a report and my invoice.

920
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,952
Thank you.

921
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:55,837
Oi! Wakey, wakey, beach bunny!
What the hell do you think you're doing?

922
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:58,631
These are Henry's private papers.
They're irreplaceable!

923
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:03,094
Did you know Dad mixed a martini
for Winston Churchill?

924
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:08,391
He also danced a waltz
with Amelia Earhart in 1975.

925
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,352
Well, considering Amelia Earhart
died in the 1930s,

926
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:14,689
that's a perfect example of the type
of exaggerator Uncle Henry was.

927
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,441
You wanna know
the real Uncle Henry?

928
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:19,277
Not the one your overactive
imagination's manufacturing?

929
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,822
The real Henry Skinner was so afraid
of committing to the real world,

930
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:26,326
he retreated from life to drink and
shag his way to a lonely, loveless end.

931
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:31,789
Everything I need to know
about my dad is right here.

932
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,459
It's right in front of me.

933
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:39,464
You know, and if this place meant
as much to him as I believe it did,

934
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,634
you're worse than I thought
for even thinking about selling it.

935
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,185
I'll leave tomorrow.

936
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:44,779
Uncle Henry!

937
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:48,366
- Let's see you, then.
- One, two...

938
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:16,227
- Yes?
- Hello.

939
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,895
You working hard on the house?

940
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,690
Charlie. Yes. At it since daybreak.

941
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:25,153
Really? I hate to think of you
toiling down there all on your own.

942
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:29,240
Well, we're English, Charlie, you know.
Born to rule and sacrifice.

943
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:32,493
- Yes.
- Where are you?

944
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:34,037
I'm outside.

945
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:38,416
Wow.

946
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:44,255
Max, take my original estimate
and shove it up my ass!

947
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,340
Shh! Shh!

948
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,676
If I can't get you five million
for this baby, I'm in the wrong sport!

949
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,178
What?

950
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,221
What?

951
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:55,350
- Oh, dear.
- What?

952
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,852
This is a disaster.

953
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:01,689
Mr. Froggy Wine Man has just knocked
a million off our sale price.

954
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,816
Oh, bugger it.
We'll just go to plan two.

955
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:06,444
Just flog it as fast as we can
for as much as we can.

956
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:10,281
And just keep in mind that the vigneron,
Duflot, stays on, he's part of the deal.

957
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,784
- Okay, I'll do my best.
- Right.

958
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:16,704
Max. So, what's on the agenda
for this evening? Steak-frites?

959
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,624
Bottle of pastis?
Evening game of bridge?

960
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,793
Charlie, please.
Real men don't play bridge.

961
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:26,923
And I have an obligatory cultural activity
in the village this evening.

962
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,550
Can I come? Will there be girls?

963
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,720
No and yes.

964
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:38,226
So you're leaving
your best friend alone

965
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,229
in an eerie chateau
on his first night.

966
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:45,441
Charlie. No. I'm leaving you alone.

967
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,736
And you're not as alone
as you think you are.

968
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:52,073
You'll find a friend. Okay?

969
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:19,183
Max. We thought you were dead.

970
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:22,603
I've had the word that Monday's
auction is gonna trade like a turd.

971
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:25,148
- Oh, yeah?
- A smart move

972
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:30,653
would be to sell 28 gilts short
at, say, 99. 10?

973
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:35,366
Good grief. Are you sure? It's risky
as hell. It'd seriously piss off the market.

974
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:37,535
Now, of course,
I'm not allowed to do the trading,

975
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:42,748
but you'll share credit with me when
the bouquets are passed around. Yes?

976
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,584
All right, Max. See you later.

977
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:46,377
Righto.

978
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:49,422
Boss, someone's shorting
Monday's gilt auction.

979
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:54,719
Skinner.

980
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:58,347
Not this time, you miserable sod.

981
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,892
Buy! Buy!

982
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,603
Get your hands
on as much as you can!

983
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,465
Hello?

984
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,091
Hello?

985
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,969
Anyone there?

986
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,472
- Hello?
- Who are you?

987
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:45,186
I'm Charlie's friend, Max. No, I'm not.
I'm Max's friend, Charlie.

988
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:49,023
Okay, Max's friend.

989
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:53,444
I need you to come up here
and take a look at my back.

990
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:00,284
Thanks.

991
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:18,135
Have I told you you're a vision?

992
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:22,682
Oui, from the bottom of the pool
when you were peeking up my skirt.

993
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,601
Gosh, guilty as charged.
Sorry about that.

994
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:30,481
- You look lovely.
- You too.

995
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:34,026
Sartorial elegance by Henri.

996
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:39,198
Wow. Le Coin Perdu.

997
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:41,909
I've never actually seen a bottle.

998
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,536
Have you heard of it?

999
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:44,787
It's expensive.

1000
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:50,668
- Are you trying to seduce me, Max?
- Oh, gosh. No, of course not.

1001
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:55,339
Thought would never even cross
my mind. Not more than six or 10 times.

1002
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:06,851
Yeah, right now it's sort
of the color of ripe pomegranate.

1003
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:08,311
Bummer.

1004
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,023
Could you look
in the medicine cabinet

1005
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:15,192
for some aloe, aspirin,
bucket of ice.

1006
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,485
Yeah.

1007
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,781
- I'm Christie, by the way.
- Charlie.

1008
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:25,202
- How do you do?
- Love your accent.

1009
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,121
Thanks.

1010
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:28,748
Love your bum.

1011
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:07,119
There's something you should know
about me, Max.

1012
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:08,204
Yes?

1013
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:11,165
I'm very, very choosy.

1014
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:13,292
Well, I'm very, very honored.

1015
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:19,006
I'm also very, very suspicious,

1016
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:20,883
very, very irrational,

1017
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:23,719
and I have a very,
very short temper.

1018
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:30,059
I'm also extremely jealous
and slow to forgive. Just so you know.

1019
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:32,311
Well, this promises
to be a lovely evening.

1020
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:39,026
I wouldn't go to Rome.
It is quite overcrowded.

1021
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,279
And there's more tourists
than pigeons.

1022
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,700
Gotta go somewhere. Maybe Venice.

1023
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:48,035
Yeah, but it's sinking.

1024
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,830
You know, one false move,
fall in the canal...

1025
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:52,456
Sorry.

1026
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:53,916
...run down by a gondolier.

1027
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,961
Whereas London, it's got it all.

1028
01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:01,632
Including your own personal tour guide.
Yeah. Moi.

1029
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,468
Charlie.

1030
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:07,680
Concentrate.

1031
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,640
Sorry.

1032
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:39,587
Alone at last.

1033
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:43,090
You've been candid with me,
I should be candid with you.

1034
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:49,889
I'm famously callous,
even to the point of being insensitive.

1035
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:55,144
And I have an absolute inability
to trust anyone.

1036
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:01,567
The only person I ever loved
was my Uncle Henry,

1037
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,529
and I didn't contact him
for the last 10 years of his life.

1038
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:08,949
He often expressed great sadness.

1039
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,870
As though he thought
you had been lost.

1040
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:14,789
You knew him?

1041
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:19,293
As a woman living here,
it was impossible not to know him.

1042
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,170
Right.

1043
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:25,508
He didn't, by any chance, ever get out
the Edmundo records and do the...

1044
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:26,842
Rumba?

1045
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,346
No.

1046
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:34,099
- Thank you.
- But of course I tried.

1047
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:37,019
Well, you would,
because he was absolutely lovable.

1048
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:38,729
Yes.

1049
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:43,067
I can't think of why
I stopped coming down here.

1050
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:48,739
I love this place.

1051
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:50,491
It's intoxicating.

1052
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,001
Scorpions!

1053
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:46,088
Scorpions!

1054
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:51,635
There are scorpions in my bedroom!

1055
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:56,307
I must go to work.

1056
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:58,893
Isn't that usually the man's line?

1057
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:09,820
Do you know the reason
why I spent the night with you?

1058
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:16,660
It is because once you have done
what you came here to do,

1059
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,621
you will not return.

1060
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:23,167
For us, there can be no future.

1061
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:27,087
There is safety in that.

1062
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:31,133
Well...

1063
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:38,015
There is absolutely nothing stopping us
from setting up your café in Notting Hill.

1064
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,643
London definitely needs
a decent bistro.

1065
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:43,646
How typical.

1066
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:48,984
To assume that I live in Provence
because I have no choice.

1067
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:52,738
Fanny, this place
just doesn't suit my life.

1068
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:55,574
No, Max.

1069
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:59,161
It is your life
that doesn't suit this place.

1070
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,430
What happened to the diving board?

1071
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:24,979
We did quite well, didn't we?

1072
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:29,566
Yeah, I don't think we did too badly
considering the oenologue's report.

1073
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:35,447
You know, Charlie,

1074
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,326
I think I'm in love.

1075
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,746
I don't blame you, mate, she's
a goddess. Even if she is your cousin.

1076
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:45,207
Not Christie, you silly sod.

1077
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:46,834
My...

1078
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:51,130
My obligatory cultural activity is a girl.

1079
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,967
A woman. Fanny Chenal.

1080
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:00,931
I've been thinking,
perhaps I shouldn't sell.

1081
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,017
Max, I think at the moment,

1082
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:06,770
your whole body is covered
in the eau de French girl,

1083
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:10,691
and when you have had a cold shower
things will look a little bit different.

1084
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:14,862
I could keep it as a pied-à-terre.
A weekender, holiday house, you know?

1085
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:18,032
Can I remind you what happened
when your boss and mentor,

1086
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:19,658
a man you loved,

1087
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:22,286
took his first holiday in 15 years?

1088
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:24,121
I stole his job.

1089
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:29,043
Max Skinner doesn't do weekends.
Max Skinner doesn't take holidays.

1090
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,210
Max Skinner

1091
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:34,757
makes money.

1092
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:38,135
So do what you do best, Max.

1093
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:43,807
If you're gonna sell it,
you gotta sign it.

1094
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,913
Why is he singing to them,
Uncle Henry?

1095
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:11,418
Well, you see, Max,
the terroir needs more than sun and rain.

1096
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:15,839
It needs harmony. It needs balance.

1097
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:35,692
My whole life people laughed at me
for singing to the vines.

1098
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,863
I explained that someday
the vines would sing back.

1099
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:43,242
Here they finally have.

1100
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:44,993
You don't know what you are doing.

1101
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:49,748
- What are you talking about?
- Here. Le Coin Perdu.

1102
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,543
That's not possible.

1103
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,629
The oenologue said you couldn't
even grow squash or potatoes...

1104
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:58,549
The oenologue was paid to say that.

1105
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:01,885
We thought that if you believed
La Siroque had no value,

1106
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:05,722
you would leave things as they were.
Sorte de status quo.

1107
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:08,976
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Why didn't you trust me?

1108
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:12,020
Max, would you trust you?

1109
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:14,481
These vines, they are illegal.

1110
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:19,236
Your uncle always intended
to leave the estate to you,

1111
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:21,989
but he worried about
what you had become.

1112
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:25,701
"My nephew is selfish,"
he used to say.

1113
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:27,911
"How can I give this place to a man

1114
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:31,290
"who can't even appreciate
the simple pleasures of life?"

1115
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,960
So it was never written.

1116
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,089
Alas, fate took him before
he could decide what to do.

1117
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:44,303
I've already sold it.

1118
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:51,268
Then you have done the very thing
your uncle feared you would do.

1119
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:57,566
You have sold his spirit
to the highest bidder, Max.

1120
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:01,278
And betrayed the only man
who ever cared for you.

1121
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,368
Here, Max.

1122
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:13,290
Here was Henry's fuck-you money!

1123
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:39,066
- This one.
- Well chosen.

1124
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,652
It's not quite there yet.

1125
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:45,447
Once you find something good, Max,
you have to take care of it.

1126
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:47,324
You have to let it grow.

1127
01:35:58,628 --> 01:36:00,420
Christie.

1128
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,547
What're you doing?
You can't just leave.

1129
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:03,840
Sure I can.

1130
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:07,427
Well, what about last night? I nursed you
through second-degree burns.

1131
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:09,263
You were sweet.

1132
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:12,099
And I seriously damaged
the ends of my fingers.

1133
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,184
Frostbitten.

1134
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:16,019
Like your heart.

1135
01:36:21,234 --> 01:36:23,485
Bye, Charlie.

1136
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,028
Bye, Christie.

1137
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:38,000
Where you headed?

1138
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,335
Not exactly sure.

1139
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:41,670
I brought you something.

1140
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:43,672
Your book.

1141
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:44,923
You didn't finish it.

1142
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:51,722
Christie?

1143
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:55,309
You do have his nose.

1144
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:02,149
Au revoir, cuz.

1145
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,572
Dear Max,

1146
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:12,034
I know it's been many years
since we last spoke,

1147
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:16,455
but I've found myself in a bit of a jam
and I'm afraid I need your help.

1148
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:19,791
The thing is, Max old boy, I'm dying.

1149
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:24,588
I know because Dr. Khan, my physician
has stopped talking about my health

1150
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:27,132
and begun discussing the weather.

1151
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:31,303
Convinced that death,
like all tradesmen,

1152
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:34,097
would be unable
to find my front door,

1153
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:38,935
and having always believed wills
to be written invitations to the reaper,

1154
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:42,356
I find myself impelled
to impress upon your kindness.

1155
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:47,903
I have a daughter.
Her name is Christie Roberts.

1156
01:37:48,154 --> 01:37:50,697
Sadly, we have never met.

1157
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:53,617
Her mother's name was Allison.

1158
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:58,705
She was a tour guide
at a tiny vineyard in Northern California.

1159
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:00,332
I should like you to find her.

1160
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:06,171
And to this end I should like
to leave her what is rightfully hers.

1161
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:08,465
I hope this decision
doesn't hurt your feelings,

1162
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:12,177
and as successful as you are,
you don't need it.

1163
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:13,762
I hope you understand.

1164
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:19,726
Because for me, even in its present
state, La Siroque is a place of magic.

1165
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:23,063
And it is my heartfelt wish

1166
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:26,775
that Christie should share
in that magic.

1167
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,569
I like to think of her here.

1168
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:33,657
After all, she and La Siroque
are all I leave behind.

1169
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:35,784
Your loving uncle...

1170
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:37,077
Your loving uncle...

1171
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:38,870
...Henry Skinner.

1172
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:41,706
...Henry Skinner.

1173
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:50,090
Il y'a un petit wrinkle.

1174
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,801
What do you mean?
What sort of wrinkle?

1175
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,389
Genghis. Back from the dead.

1176
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:01,935
Justin, lovely tie.
Do tell your mother I admire her taste.

1177
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:03,770
Welcome back, boss.

1178
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:05,480
I bet.

1179
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:07,691
You wanker!

1180
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:09,526
Kenneth, nice haircut.

1181
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:10,819
You set me up.

1182
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:13,905
Oh, dear boy, you haven't been fired
in my absence, have you?

1183
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:17,117
That short order.
Did my nuts in in less than an hour.

1184
01:39:17,285 --> 01:39:18,410
That's unfortunate.

1185
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:20,745
Lost us six million quid.

1186
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:23,748
Couldn't have anything to do with me,
Kenny. I was suspended.

1187
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:26,042
You bastard!

1188
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:27,627
Morning, lab rats.

1189
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29,671
Morning, boss.

1190
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:32,215
Morning, Max.

1191
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:46,438
You look different.

1192
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:50,066
Give me everything I need to read
to catch up and an espresso.

1193
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:52,736
- Max?
- Hm?

1194
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:55,947
Sir Nigel's waiting for you.

1195
01:39:57,575 --> 01:39:58,617
Make it a double.

1196
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:42,911
Van Gogh.

1197
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,208
I hope you've got a good lock
on the door.

1198
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:49,459
Don't be soft.

1199
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:53,880
It's not real.
Real one's in my vault. It's a copy.

1200
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:58,885
Two hundred grand for a knock-off.

1201
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,595
Sit.

1202
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:07,310
Art's a passion, Max.

1203
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:11,898
Got to have passions.
I have horses, cars, money...

1204
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,441
Are they passions or vices, sir?

1205
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:15,318
Have I finished talking?

1206
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:22,158
When I finish talking, that's
when you talk. And it better be good!

1207
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:26,871
While you've been on your little holiday,
I've been in a shitstorm!

1208
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:31,501
Sir, I do appreciate that my actions
may have caused some...

1209
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:32,919
Max!

1210
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:37,340
You're one of the ballsiest traders
in the Square Mile.

1211
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:42,887
But you've got to learn there are
consequences to your sort of behavior.

1212
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:47,809
There it is.

1213
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:50,979
You have one hour.

1214
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:58,570
So shall I pack my Smurfs?

1215
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:18,381
Oh, Max!

1216
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:20,717
Look after Madame Chenal's
daughter, Fanny,

1217
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:22,886
while I give her mother a tour.

1218
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:26,556
But I really wanna finish
the last chapter of Death in Venice.

1219
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:30,894
Well, given the book's title, I don't think
you'll be surprised by the ending.

1220
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:33,521
- You be good, Fanny.
- Come now, Madame Chenal.

1221
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:36,650
There are many attractions
here at La Siroque,

1222
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:39,694
beginning with the view
best seen from my bedroom.

1223
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:43,299
That's a lot of zeroes, Max.

1224
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:45,719
Or a full partnership for life.

1225
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:48,596
My choice.

1226
01:43:49,682 --> 01:43:51,850
Now, you listen to Mummy, Max.

1227
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:55,311
Partner, you're made for life.

1228
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:59,774
Sir Nigel didn't become partner
until he was 53 and look at him.

1229
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:03,403
Yes,

1230
01:44:03,904 --> 01:44:05,947
look at him.

1231
01:44:09,285 --> 01:44:13,955
Well, what's it to be?
The money, or your life?

1232
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:18,376
When do you ever see it, Nige?

1233
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:21,004
The real one.

1234
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:22,589
When do you look at it?

1235
01:44:22,798 --> 01:44:26,342
Do you make late-night pilgrimages
down to the vault just to see it or...

1236
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:29,554
What point are you making?

1237
01:45:08,761 --> 01:45:09,761
I think so.

1238
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:14,390
Sure you don't need more time?

1239
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:16,810
No, I know what I want.

1240
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:20,063
You're sure?

1241
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:23,942
Absolutely.

1242
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:29,739
So, what is it to be?

1243
01:45:31,784 --> 01:45:33,201
How's the soup?

1244
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:35,995
The soup is finished.

1245
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:38,248
Like my job.

1246
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:43,378
The fish?

1247
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:46,214
We've run out.

1248
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:49,592
That's like me with excuses.

1249
01:45:52,304 --> 01:45:54,931
Don't waste my time.
Choose something we have.

1250
01:45:58,727 --> 01:46:02,564
I would like a lifetime spent with
an irrational and suspicious goddess.

1251
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:10,446
Some short-tempered jealousy
on the side.

1252
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:14,659
And a bottle of wine
that tastes like you.

1253
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:16,870
And a glass that's never empty.

1254
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:43,229
You remember
what I whispered to you

1255
01:46:44,565 --> 01:46:47,150
when we were kids in the pool.

1256
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:49,736
And it seems that you do too.

1257
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:58,286
But it was not until just now
that I recognized you,

1258
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:00,371
Max.

1259
01:47:28,484 --> 01:47:31,110
- Little girl, listen to me!
- Duflot, I said no!

1260
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:34,447
No way! You are not
destemming those grapes.

1261
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:36,532
But this is the way
I've always done things!

1262
01:47:36,617 --> 01:47:39,160
We want structure and color
for the wine.

1263
01:47:39,244 --> 01:47:41,621
Leaving the stems on
will give it a kick in the ass.

1264
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:43,539
And the wine will taste like rocket fuel.

1265
01:47:43,624 --> 01:47:46,167
No way!
You are not destemming those grapes.

1266
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:47,669
All acid and tannins!

1267
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:49,921
- Oh, you say acid and tannins.
- Yes!

1268
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:53,508
I say flavor and cojones.
You know, Barolos, Super Tuscans.

1269
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:56,511
That's what's selling out there!
Not some wimpy wine from Luberon!

1270
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:00,807
Max. Thank God you are here.

1271
01:48:01,058 --> 01:48:03,768
I will not work
with this mad person! Never!

1272
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:09,148
I love her, this woman. She...

1273
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,943
She's like Henry, with a nice ass.

1274
01:48:15,072 --> 01:48:16,197
Oh!

1275
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:20,743
I can't deal with this guy, Max.

1276
01:48:21,078 --> 01:48:22,912
What is it with the French?

1277
01:48:23,956 --> 01:48:26,874
Oh, and by the way,

1278
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:29,752
you were running low on green ink
so I bought you some more.

1279
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:33,089
Never know

1280
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:34,882
you might wanna
write a letter or something.

1281
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:44,225
- Yes?
- How's Christie?

1282
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:45,727
How's the sale going, Charlie?

1283
01:48:45,894 --> 01:48:47,812
Apartments in this bracket
shift in a blink.

1284
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:50,314
I'm confident of getting you
more than you paid.

1285
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:51,524
Bullshit, Charlie.

1286
01:48:51,734 --> 01:48:54,610
If you don't get me a 40 percent yield,
you're off the gig. Got me?

1287
01:48:56,113 --> 01:49:00,700
Max, you do realize, of course, it's not
gonna last down there, don't you?

1288
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:02,243
You don't say.

1289
01:49:02,494 --> 01:49:05,580
And as impossible as it may seem,

1290
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:08,374
the very things
that are so unique and sexy now

1291
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:11,210
will soon be the dread
of your day-to-day existence.

1292
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:16,924
And after a few months
of eating and drinking and sleeping

1293
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:18,926
and shagging,

1294
01:49:19,011 --> 01:49:22,013
what have you got to look forward to,
you know? Boredom.

1295
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:25,641
I mean, what are you gonna do,
write a book?

1296
01:49:29,021 --> 01:49:30,313
Max, I'm your best friend.

1297
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:32,315
And I'm telling you, you won't last.

1298
01:49:33,650 --> 01:49:36,235
We'll see about that, Charlie.

1299
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:39,489
Like this, I do agree.
It's okay like this.

1300
01:49:39,698 --> 01:49:41,324
Thank you.

1301
01:49:51,168 --> 01:49:53,336
That was Charlie on the phone.

1302
01:51:12,708 --> 01:51:16,252
So are you an actual rapper?

1303
01:51:17,129 --> 01:51:18,963
No. He's the rapper, I'm the manager.

1304
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:22,592
Mm.

1305
01:51:23,886 --> 01:51:27,930
I'm Jesmenda, by the way.
Gemma for short.

1306
01:51:34,855 --> 01:51:35,938
Bollocks!

1307
01:52:34,706 --> 01:52:36,457
Viva la Armstrong!

1308
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:52,640
Be in touch.
