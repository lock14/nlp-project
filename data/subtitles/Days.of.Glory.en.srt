00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,832
We must rid France of the German occupation!

4
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,540
Come along! Come with me!

5
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,999
We must wash the French flag with our blood!

6
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,707
Come with me!

7
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,624

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,915
We must liberate France.

9
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,165
Liberate her!

10
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,582
We must save France from this situation.

11
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,499
Come on!

12
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:20,957
Saiid!

Come back!

14
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,040
Be reasonable.

15
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,374
Come back inside.

16
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,790
Your grandfather never came back.

17
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,332
Don't worry about me, Mother.

18
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,249
I want to help France.

19
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,790
I can manage.

20
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,707
They'll kill you!

21
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,499
I prefer the worst poverty to losing you.

22
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,374
You put up with too much.

23
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,582
Please, let me go.

24
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,165
It will be all right, Mother.

25
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,124
Pray for me.

26
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,707
Get in.

27
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,707
Move!

the mountain men,

33
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,915

34
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,457
better than the other Berbers,

35
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,082
and you'll prove it!

36
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,749
Listen carefully now.

37
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,999
We permit raids in enemy territory for food,

38
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,624
but hands off the women or you'll be shot.

39
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,290
In France, no raids at all.

40
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,874
We show discipline!

41
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,749

Let's go back home.

45
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,165
Serve France with pride.

46
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,957
Why did you get us enlisted?

47
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:31,874
For the money.

48
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,124
So we can marry you off.

49
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,624
Forward...

50
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,499

70
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,040
Don't salute me here.

71
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,540
They always pick officers as targets.

72
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,124

00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,457

reporting, sir!

75
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,165
What can your lads do?

76
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,290
No idea, sir.
They're my first group.

77
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,874
You got your rank how?

78
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,999
I passed the exam, sir.

79
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,332
I took mine with the Krauts.

80
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,332
CorporaI Leroux reporting, sir.

81
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,707
You can go.

82
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,374
Praise be to God.

83
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,874
Take this. It's a German rifle. The best.

84
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,290
You'll be the marksman.

85
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,707
Take it.

86
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,624
Hit the ground!

87
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,582
Don't blame him, sir.

88
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,249
They're still green.

89
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,790
I have the power of life and death over you!

90
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,040
Starting with you.

91
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,499
Yes, sir.

92
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,499
The Germans are dug in up there. At ease.

93
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,415
Our mission is to climb up to the Krauts

94
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,124
to flush them out.

95
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,582
We have to do it.

96
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,874
It's a light infantry job.

97
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,665
You'll lead the men.

98
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:26,374
Any trouble, take out a cigarette.

99
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,207
Before you light it, it'll be over.
Yes, sir.

100
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,957
It reassures the lads behind.
Yes, sir.

101
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,040
Hitting a soldier isn't allowed.

102
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,832
I know the sergeant well.
He's a good man.

103
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,207
He knows his job.

104
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,749
Where are you from, Saiid?

105
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,915
From totaI poverty.

106
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,582
Listen...

107
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,499
in that uniform,

108
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,249
you're like me now.

109
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,665
You're like all of us.

110
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,582
We're the same family.

111
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,415
The army means equality.

112
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,957
Wait a while.

113
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,249
You'll get your share of bullets tomorrow.

114
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,457
CorporaI,

115
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,582
are you afraid?

116
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,582
Enough talk.

117
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,040
Tomorrow, you'll know...

118
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,582
if you're soldiers or not.

119
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,040
Your coffee, Sarge.

120
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,207

121
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,499
CarefuI, it's hot.

122
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,915
We'll be in for it tomorrow.

123
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,165
Yes, we'll be in for it.

124
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,040

Guide us along the right path...

129
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:21,332
Guide us along the right path...

130
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,790
I declare there is no deity but God.

131
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,374
I declare that Mohammad is his prophet.

132
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,832
Move forward!

133
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,040
Abdelkader, move!

134
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,665

Shut up!

138
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,124
Move.

139
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,374
We'll die if we stay here.

140
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,915
Messaoud!

141
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,957

Larbi...

157
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,582
Don't be afraid, little brother.

158
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,290
We're not going to die today.

159
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,874

Stop that!

168
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,749
What are you doing?

169
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,499
We're soldiers, not savages.

170
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,749
Fuck you!

171
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:13,999

How many dead?

It's a magnificent victory.

178
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,999
For the first time since the 1940 defeat,

179
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,832

At ease.

188
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:34,915
What do you want?

189
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,582
I come to say thank you.

190
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,332
You save my life, Sergeant.

191
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:44,207
You want to thank me?

192
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,582
Make some coffee. You can replace Ali.

193
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,332
I'll make you a private if I'm pleased.

194
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,499
Well? What did he say?

195
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,040
Are we going home?

196
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,582
- Soon!
- Is it true?

197
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,332
Thank you, my friend.

198
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:15,374
Where's my chocolate?

199
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,665
Here.
Thank you.

200
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,790
No tomatoes for you.

201
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:36,374
Why?

202
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,124
They're not for you. Move!

203
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,290
What do you mean?

204
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,415
Let go of him!

205
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:55,124
You're cooking while he fights.
Yes, sir.

206
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,249
Move.

207
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,290
Why aren't the tomatoes for everyone?

208
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:07,040
He's right.

209
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,624
We want tomatoes too!

210
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,457
He's right!

211
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:17,082
Shut your mouths!

212
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,457
You're not happy?

213
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,915
No one will have any now...

214
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:19,457
They're ready to die for us,
but any injustice will cause mutiny.

215
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,457
You know the natives, Martinez.

216
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:22,707
Avoid that term, sir.

217
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,749
The Muslims
That's just as bad.

218
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,374
So what do I call them?

219
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,457
The men, sir. The men.

220
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,207
What's going on here?

221
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:47,624
Sir,

222
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:52,040
we fight alongside
our French brothers in arms,

223
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:55,999
on the same terrain, against the same enemy.

224
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,082
We must share the tomatoes too.

225
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,415
German bullets don't pick and choose, sir.

226
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,415
Sergeant, when we have tomatoes,

227
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:12,999
let everyone have them.

228
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,124
Yes, sir.

229
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,165
Thank you, sir.

230
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:29,874
My boys. my dear boys!

231
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,540
The dream for which so mary have died

232
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,915
is coming true at last!

233
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,040
Your wounds and suffering,

234
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:40,915
all the pain

235
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,415

00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,790
are the price to pay to be or this jourrey.

237
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:49,124

00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,207
We are going home!

239
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:44,457
PROVENCE - AUGUST 1944

240
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:41,999
Smell it.

241
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,874
It's not like at home.
No.

242
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,874
French soiI is better.

243
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,082
Look!

244
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:04,207
Long live France!

245
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,290
France!

246
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,790
Do you speak French?
Yes, I understand it.

247
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,374
What's your name?
Messaoud.

248
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:02,040
And what's your name?

249
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:03,790
Irene.

250
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,707
The sergeant says,

251
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,540
"Go up the mountain. "

252
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:21,040
I was scared,but I go up the mountain.

253
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:24,082
I go up the mountain,I run and run,

254
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,915
Messaoud to my right,Abdelkader to my left.

255
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,374
I'm not scared then.

256
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:34,874
But Germany shoots at us.
Left, right, everywhere it shoots.

257
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,082
Messaoud says,"Lie down in the hole. "

258
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:41,040
I don't speak. The sergeant looks at me,

259
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,790
I look at the sergeant.

260
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,749
I know what he wants.

261
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:49,624
I take the grenade,
pull the pin,and throw it at Germany.

262
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,707
All of Germany, they die.

263
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:03,207
I free a country, it's my country.

264
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,624
Even if I never saw it before.

265
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,832
It's my country.

266
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,499
Your country's all you like?

267
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:17,624
hrch' Allah. we'll beat Germany.
Thank you very much.

268
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,374
Look.

269
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,874
Iron Cross. German.

270
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:17,499
Very beautifuI.

271
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,999
Dangerous soldier.

272
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,165
Take this.

273
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:26,915
Good quality!

274
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,457
Iron Cross.

275
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,707
"Urlucky"

276
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,415
Why unlucky?

277
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,165
I didn't know you.

278
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,165
Sorry.

279
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,415
Good night.

280
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,332
Why were you scared?

281
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,207
The Germans won't be back.

282
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,499
You wiped them out.

283
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,957
It's not that.

284
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,082
But...

285
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:15,040
in my country,we don't go with French women.

286
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,040
Leave it!

287
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,749
Don't touch it!

288
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,124
It's a sin!

289
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,749
I swear in God's name.

290
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:42,624
Aren't you ashamed?

291
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:46,082
Why, Yassir?Is it God's?

292
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:51,207
Don't touch it.

293
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:52,957
All right.

294
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,124
Look.

295
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:20,332
Their God suffered a lot.

296
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:21,832
A lot.

297
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:27,374
Tell me, Yassir...

298
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:29,999
when I was little,

299
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:33,207
the French soldiers killed our whole family.

300
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,124
Did they massacre them?

301
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,082
What did they call it?

302
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,999
They called it...

303
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:46,165
pacification.

304
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:48,749
Pacification?

305
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,999
CorporaI, can you read?

306
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:18,582
Yes.

307
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,290
I can't read.

308
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,207
I never went to schooI.

309
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,332
You can learn.

310
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,624
Listen, Saiid...

311
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:50,874
CorporaI, come here!

312
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:00,915
What's that?

313
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,665
It's a military handbook, sir.

314
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,165
The hrfartry NCO's Hardbook.

315
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,207
You want to be a coloneI?

316
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,957
A sergeant first, sir.

317
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,999
Let me read you an extract.

318
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,499
"In theory,

319
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:26,040
no soldier should return home
illiterate from the army.

320
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:29,665
Classes are obligatory for all men

321
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,999
on their enlistment. "

322
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:38,124
Yet none of these African troops
can read or write.

323
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,999
Saiid!

324
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,624
You want to learn to read?

325
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,707
It's too late, sir.

326
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,040
And to read what?

327
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,040
Give me a clean shirt.

328
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:21,374
Messaoud

329
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,457
You'll come back?

330
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:28,457
Yes, I promise, I come back.

331
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,999
You wait for me?

332
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:31,999
Yes.

333
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:06,290
RHONE VALLEY - OCTOBER 1944

334
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:31,999
I never loved a girI like this.

335
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:36,582
I want to marry her,
have kids, and make a family.

336
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,457
You get worked up fast.

337
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:41,249
Marseilles is paradise. Here, CorporaI,

338
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:44,165
they respect me. I'm not a wog.

339
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:47,124
I swear!I make my life in France.

340
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:48,749
You'll always be a wog.

341
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:51,082
Shut it!Ever slept in sheets before?

342
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,624
Saiid! Get in!

343
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:57,207
Get in.

344
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:12,499
Aiicha!

345
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:49,332
"Me and mother 1903"

346
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:03,999
What is this shit?

347
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:07,082
Only you French guys get leave?

348
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:09,749
We've fought since Marseilles.
Us, Italy.

349
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:13,374
We're off to Paris.
You need to get back to wog land.

350
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,999
The wog fucks you.

351
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:35,332
You miss home?

352
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,540
Your family?

353
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,165
Why speak Arabic?

354
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:51,624
Me too.
I like to go leave and see my mother.

355
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:03,165
Any maiI for me?
There's no maiI for you.

356
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:05,207
You must look again.
It's not normaI.

357
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,499
I wrote three times. Messaoud Souni.

358
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:11,999
Or maybe I'm listed as dead.
I said no.

359
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,415
Private!
There's nothing for you.

360
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:29,290
Here's Aiicha!

361
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,249
How is she?

362
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:37,332
Has Sergeant Martinez repudiated you?

363
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,332
Marrying a Moroccan?

364
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:44,040
Why are you getting at me?

365
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,874
Go to your Marseilles girI.

366
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,790
An American's probably banging her now.

367
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:52,457
It doesn't matter.

368
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:54,165
You know why?

369
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,332
Here...

370
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:58,040
you're the one we want, Aiicha.

371
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,207
Our beautifuI Aiicha.

372
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:05,249
She takes care of us.

373
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,957
As God is my witness...

374
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:11,707
Saiid, calm down!

375
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:14,832
...if ever you call me Aiicha again...

376
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,582
If one of you...

377
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,665
No problem, my brother.

378
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,249
Everyone has understood.

379
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:27,915
Stop it.

380
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,790
Leave him be. Calm down.

381
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:31,915
If anyone calls me Aiicha,

382
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,457
I'll kill him.

383
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,582
Let go of him.

384
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:39,499
I'm not a child!
Let go of him!

385
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,040
Let go of him!

386
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:42,874
SAID

387
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,665
You're mad!

388
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:54,957
Are you soldiers, idiots, or what?

389
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:58,040
Get out of here!

390
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,915
Get out! Go on!

391
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,332
Hurry it up!

392
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:06,249
Don't try that again!

393
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,832
Listen to me, you.

394
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,082
You're not a slave.

395
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,374
There are no slaves here!

396
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,874
No one has bothered about me here,

397
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,332
except the sergeant.

398
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,415
Learn your book by heart and become a coloneI.

399
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:31,374
Who's becoming a coloneI?
This donkey?

400
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:33,207
This mule?

401
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:37,165
Why wouldn't they become colonels?

402
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:40,582
Why not him?

403
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:43,082
And even him?

404
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,499
We can try.

405
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,999
So try!

406
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,040
It's over!

407
00:50:58,666 --> 00:50:59,957
Get to your bunks!

408
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,165
Do it!

409
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,207
I want no more trouble!

410
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,207
THE VOSGES - NOVEMBER 1944

411
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,540
Yes, it looks ugly!

412
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:35,832
It'll be even worse in there!

413
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:38,999
It'll be tougher than Italy.

414
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,249
But I have faith in you.

415
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:46,374
I have faith in you to liberate your homeland.

416
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:51,665
The French have placed their fate in our hands

417
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,249
and are watching us with eyes full of hope.

418
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:59,582
We have to be up there by dark!

419
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:02,832
And, even dead, we shall be! Even dead!

420
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,749
Is it Omar, sir?

421
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:21,290
Sir...

422
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,499
I've taken the position.

423
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,832
I'm here, sir.

424
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,624
I'm in charge here!

425
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,540
I ordered you to regroup,
not to head off on your own!

426
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:39,749
I give the orders. Look where it's got us!

427
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:42,040
We've lost Omar!

428
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:53,207
Go to say we've taken the position
and request orders.

429
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:55,457
Yes, sir.

430
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:28,707
Sir?

431
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,749
I have news for you, Saiid.

432
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:35,332
You're promoted private.

433
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:37,499
You're transferred to HQ.

434
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:39,499
Take your pack and go there.

435
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,999
I don't want to be private, Sarge.

436
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:48,790
I'm fine like I am now.

437
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,082
I was kidding!

438
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:04,999
SAID

439
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:10,165
Learn to fend for yourself.

440
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,499
I might die one day.

441
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:18,832
You're not going to die, Sarge.

442
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:21,790
You not say that ever.

443
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:26,999
You're going to be alive

444
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:29,249
to become captain, irch' Allah.

445
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,874
Captain's too much paperwork.

446
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,665
Are French girls like this, sir?

447
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:58,790
She says she's with you
for life and then forgets you.

448
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,249
Is that how it is here?

449
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:04,082
When you get promoted,
pick a rich, pretty one.

450
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:06,915
She's beautifuI, CorporaI.

451
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:11,999
Look at the photo

452
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,915
and tell me what you think.
Tell me the truth.

453
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:18,457
Is she serious or not serious?

454
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,582
What's her name?
Irene.

455
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:22,915
Irene's a pretty name.

456
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:29,499
We have to see this war out.
We'll return in honor.

457
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:31,665
Irene will be proud of you.

458
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:51,082
Listen to this.

459
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,165
"After the war, I return, Irene.

460
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:56,874
I send you kisses. I think of you...

461
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,249
day and night. Messaoud. "

462
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,582
Pretty, huh?
It's like a song.

463
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,332
CENSORED

464
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:12,040
They're not idiots, sir.

465
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:15,957
They've been away 20 months,
they're freezing here...

466
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:17,249
I know, Sergeant!

467
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:19,582
The French get leave.
No ships!

468
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,165
There were ships to bring them,

469
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:24,249
but none to send them on leave?

470
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:28,415
We'd like to see our families,

471
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:31,124
like the mainland French. It's unfair.

472
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:36,957
And the French get promotion
before anyone from North Africa!

473
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:40,624
You're doing good work.
I'll put you up for promotion.

474
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:44,624
I don't want it.
My men deserve it as much as me.

475
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:47,457
CorporaI Abdelkader, for instance.

476
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:10,124
Don't sleep.

477
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,832
Wake up! Get up!

478
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,415
God rest his souI.

479
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:45,415
What's this?

480
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,124
What does it say?

481
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:49,082
Read it.

482
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:54,790
"Muslim soldier...

483
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:59,040
"know that you can cross to the German side,

484
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,957
"where you will be warmly welcomed

485
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:04,665
"and your life spared.

486
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:10,457
"Your leaders send you
to die rather than the French.

487
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:12,999
"Muslim soldier,

488
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:16,457
"you weren't born into slavery.

489
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:20,040
"Germany will give you your freedom.

490
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:26,124
The day of independence has come for Africa. "

491
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,957
What would you do with us,Abdelkader?

492
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:37,499
You have something in mind?

493
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:39,582
Out with it,

494
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,249
man to man.

495
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:46,582
De Gaulle said we're fighting for liberty.

496
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:51,124
I'm fighting with France against Nazism.

497
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,624
Come out of your holes!

498
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,207
We have leave!

499
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:35,707
Come out!

500
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:37,624
We have leave!

501
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,999
We're going home.

502
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:56,124
"Labor Exchange Office for German Workers"

503
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:15,332
Those aren't to go home in.

504
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:25,124
There'll be dancers tonight!

505
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:43,957
She hasn't written back.

506
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:46,999
Be patient.

507
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,999
There's a war on. The maiI hasn't arrived.

508
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:53,040
It has. There was nothing for me.

509
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:56,790
Leroux! Martinez!

510
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:02,832
Martinez,
you're promoted to staff sergeant. Bravo.

511
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:04,499
Thank you, sir.

512
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,040
And you're a sergeant now, Leroux.
Congratulations.

513
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:11,582
Try to find stripes.

514
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:14,999
Well done, Leroux.

515
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,540
Thank you, Staff Sergeant.

516
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:22,915
Messaoud!

517
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:28,874
The girls will go wild for you in those boots!

518
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:35,874
Do you like your coat, CorporaI?

519
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:38,040
Yes, I suppo se.

520
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,832
God preserve you.

521
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:51,082
Amen.

522
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:28,165
He's wearing me out!I have to go.

523
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,082
Here I am!

524
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,999
Sit yourself down.

525
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:42,249
Whisky?

526
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:44,832
Like America.

527
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,332
Sorry, Sarge, it burns!

528
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:00,999
Just a second.

529
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,457
Have a cigar.

530
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,499
Is it for me?
Of course it's for you.

531
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,040
You know...

532
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:28,957
I don't unusually smoke cigars,

533
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:30,499
but I will now.

534
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:37,374
I like you, Saiid.

535
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,040
Me too, Sarge.

536
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:44,124
I like you.

537
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,499
You deserve promotion.

538
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:50,957
The whole unit does. But they can't see that.

539
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,999
They can't tell. They don't know us.

540
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,332
We'll liberate the country and go home.

541
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,665
But, Sarge...

542
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:17,374
here too is our home.

543
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:19,999
It's France.

544
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:22,165
We're fighting for her,for the motherland.

545
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:23,415
Here is our home, and I know...

546
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:28,207
you're like us too...

547
01:06:31,166 --> 01:06:32,332
an Arab.

548
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:36,249
What did you just say?

549
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:41,582
I see the photo of your mother in the shirt.

550
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,790
It's incredible.

551
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:46,624
It's incredible.

552
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:48,749
Put the photo of your mother

553
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:54,040
next to the photo of my mother,
they look like two sisters.

554
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:56,124
You searched my things, bastard!

555
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:04,124
Shit-stirrer! Scum!

556
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,707
Never talk about that again or I'll kill you.

557
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:13,457
Get lost!

558
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:51,999
Fall in! Attention!

559
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,582
At ease!

560
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:44,040
What is this shit?

561
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:47,999
Sit down!

562
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:59,290
I'm taking my leave!I'm off to Marseilles.

563
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:23,707
With her potatoes Ard moldy bears

564
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:26,999
Frarce is our mother She feeds us

565
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:28,040
Listen!

566
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:36,540
Listen to me, my brothers!

567
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:41,624
When I enlisted,I listened to De Gaulle.

568
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,124
He said France was fighting for
freedom around the world.

569
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:50,165
I thought the war would give us
the rights of our French brothers.

570
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,915
We're all fighting against Hitler

571
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,874
for liberty,equality, and fraternity.

572
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:01,415
It's high time they gave us
some of that liberty,

573
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:06,749
that equality and,above all, that fraternity!

574
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:25,332
We're changing the destiny of France!

575
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,665
Things must change for us too!

576
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,499
Stand aside!

577
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:34,999
You're asking for it!

578
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,540
You keep stirring up shit all the time!

579
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:38,874
The French reward themselves,

580
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,874
then you French North Africans,

581
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,624
and the Africans are forgotten.

582
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:44,707
There are quotas.

583
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:48,207
Quotas?

584
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,165
Why didn't you tell us?

585
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:56,332
You can't understand,
so shut up and step down!

586
01:11:56,458 --> 01:12:00,999
Why can't I understand?
A wog has less of a brain than you?

587
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,999
Wogs aren't cut out to lead men.

588
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,999
That day will come, Sergeant.

589
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:13,374
Sorry, Staff Sergeant.

590
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,665
What are you doing here?

591
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:47,999
I tried to get to Marseilles.

592
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:52,665
The French get leave,we get nothing.
Is that normaI?

593
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:54,457
Is it normaI?

594
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:56,707
You tried to desert.

595
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:58,999
Are you crazy?

596
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:01,707
I have to see her.

597
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:09,165
Why are you here, CorporaI?

598
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:16,999
I had a fight with Martinez,the staff sergeant.

599
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:23,415
Got a Gauloise?
Yes.

600
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:34,874
They're on the front.
Their position is top secret.

601
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,249
Write to him.

602
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:42,374
I already have, severaI times.
There's been no reply.

603
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:49,457
Tell me...

604
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:52,457
is he dead?

605
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:56,832
Give me his name. We'll find out.

606
01:13:58,041 --> 01:14:00,999
Messaoud Souni.

607
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:05,499
He's with the 7th Algerian
Infantry Regiment.

608
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,999
If we hear anything, we'll let you know.

609
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:14,749
Thank you.

610
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:18,957
ColoneI, we must be firm with the Muslims.

611
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:21,874
Punish this corporaI as a warning.

612
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:25,165
Rambert, tell me something.

613
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,999
Yes, sir?

614
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:30,624
Before joining De Gaulle at the last minute,

615
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:32,582
what were you in Vichy?

616
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:40,790
Martinez.
Yes, sir.

617
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:44,249
You know the Muslims. What do we do with him?

618
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:46,874
He's loyaI to France, sir.

619
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:48,999
All my men are patriots.

620
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:57,790
You risk being court-martialled!

621
01:14:57,916 --> 01:15:00,415
There's injustice, sir.
Silence!

622
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:04,374
We must strive together
towards one goaI: victory.

623
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,249
France needs us, all of us.

624
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,082
Do you understand what I'm saying?

625
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:12,374
Yes, sir.

626
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:21,249
In Alsace, the 37th U.S. Division

627
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:22,749
has broken through.

628
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:27,915
They're under attack and require
reinforcements and ammunition.

629
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,957
We must hold this bridgehead

630
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:34,249
untiI the generaI attack due any day.

631
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:37,582
Captain Durieux needs brave men,

632
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:39,582
men of experience.

633
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:41,832
It's a very dangerous mission.

634
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,374
I'll volunteer for it, sir.

635
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:52,457
CorporaI,I give you my word of honor.

636
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:56,165
The rewards for yourself
and all the brave men

637
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:58,499
who contribute to this exploit

638
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:00,290
will be worthy of the feat.

639
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:04,457
You will be the first to reach Alsace.

640
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:07,957
All of France will watch and remember you.

641
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:12,665
I shall fight with my body and souI,

642
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,790
as I have always done.

643
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:20,665
CorporaI Abdelkader.

644
01:16:20,958 --> 01:16:22,749
He's a man of his word.

645
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:27,707
There's no time to lose.
Get your unit's ammunition.

646
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:29,749
Sir...

647
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,832
Private Messaoud is in jaiI.

648
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:37,207
We need our marksman. I'll see to it.

649
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:38,249
Thank you, sir.

650
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,415
Tell the men to keep quiet.

651
01:16:58,416 --> 01:17:00,915
Quiet!We're nearing the German lines.

652
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,165
Keep quiet and controI the mules.

653
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:20,624
Larbi!

654
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:55,874
Why?

655
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,124
Why, God? Why?

656
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:11,457
Why?

657
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:47,165
The captain and Leroux are dead.

658
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:51,415
We've lost five men too.

659
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:56,082
You're the one in charge now.

660
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:02,707
It's your decision.

661
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:09,040
Either you help the Americans
hold the position...

662
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,457
or you turn back.

663
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:30,624
Fetch the mule. We're carrying on!

664
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,749
We're out of ammunition!

665
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:34,082
He's right.
Silence!

666
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:37,415
We'll be the first French in Alsace.

667
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:43,499
If we manage to hold
the American positions, believe me...

668
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:46,165
we'll get what we deserve.

669
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:47,999
You'll get nothing.

670
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:50,415
Haven't you realized yet?

671
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:53,332
I've given my brother for France.

672
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:57,207
Enough!

673
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:02,999
CorporaI! Be reasonable!

674
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:04,332
Be reasonable!

675
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:06,457
You want to kill each other?

676
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:08,207
There have been enough dead!

677
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:10,207
CorporaI, pull yourself together!

678
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:12,874
Our comrades are dead.

679
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:16,499
Thanks to God,we're still alive.

680
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:21,124
God bless your family.

681
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,665
He's right.

682
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:28,332
It's no use anymore.
What's wrong with you?

683
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:31,790
You want to be a sergeant?
Too late.

684
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:34,665
You don't understand a thing!

685
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:38,957
We're doing our duty by going to Alsace!

686
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:44,207
Even if we pay 10 or 100 times more,

687
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:45,540
we'll pay!

688
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,915
And they'll recognize us for it.

689
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:55,165
What's wrong with you?

690
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:57,499
Listen.

691
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:02,457
You want to go home empty-handed?

692
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:04,124
We see it through to the end.

693
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:08,457
Larbi, rest his souI, won't have died in vain.

694
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:16,207
Saiid, please go.

695
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:18,415
Bring the mule back!

696
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:20,457
Don't fight anymore.

697
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:23,374
It's over. Hurry!

698
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:51,207
Come here.

699
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:54,499
Come here, beauty!

700
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:07,957
Come here.

701
01:23:10,041 --> 01:23:11,915
Don't make things worse.

702
01:23:12,958 --> 01:23:14,040
I'm tired.

703
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:17,374
Be good.

704
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:19,874
I can't run after you.

705
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,915
For the love of God!

706
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:50,707
Yassir, round the back.

707
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:27,374
The French!

708
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,082
You're alone?Where are the others?

709
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:38,249
We'll defend the position, sir.

710
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:42,207
We'll hold it untiI our troops arrive.

711
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,790
I would have done the same...

712
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:50,290
CorporaI.

713
01:29:58,375 --> 01:29:59,832
I have to go and see the men.

714
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:16,624
I hope you're going to die...

715
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,165
Sergeant.

716
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:25,832
Staff Sergeant.

717
01:32:46,291 --> 01:32:48,790
It's as if there was no war on.

718
01:32:51,083 --> 01:32:55,207
What are we doing here?

719
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:03,332
When the war is over,you'll stay in the army.

720
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:07,999
You'll rise up through the ranks to sergeant.

721
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:12,374
I don't want to be a sergeant!

722
01:33:15,875 --> 01:33:18,249
Some have the right to it and others don't.

723
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,582
God has forgotten me for now.

724
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:29,582
Have you ever given an order to anyone?

725
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:33,207
Never.

726
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:40,207
Tell me frankly.

727
01:33:41,333 --> 01:33:43,040
Will we get through this?

728
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:12,707
Listen, Saiid...

729
01:34:13,833 --> 01:34:15,415
we've always got through it...

730
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:17,665
together.

731
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:19,582
Have you forgotten?

732
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:24,165
Everything's in God's hands.

733
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:44,124
Thank you, ma'am.

734
01:34:52,541 --> 01:34:54,332
Enjoy your meaI.

735
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,082
Thank you, ma'am.

736
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,749
Who can live in this cold?

737
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:05,332
The French.

738
01:35:57,583 --> 01:35:59,082
Can I fetch milk?

739
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,415
Does she give a lot of milk?

740
