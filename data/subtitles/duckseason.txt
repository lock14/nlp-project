{34780}{34838}I told you not to use|that defence formation
{34848}{34872}You play, then

{35874}{35898}He passes the ball
{36738}{36788}-What the hell?|-It was a goal
{36796}{36840}-No goal|-Of course it was, it went in
{36846}{36894}He was right at the corner
{36908}{36966}-Yeah, but it didn't go in|-It was a perfect shot
{36972}{37050}-It was clearly a goal|-But it was a goal
{37054}{37092}It didn't go in
{37716}{37802}-It was about to hit the crossbar|-It's not true, it was going down

{38256}{38280}Martita?
{38302}{38390}Tell Jorge that|I'm going to be a bit late
{38396}{38436}I had a problem with a delivery
{38456}{38508}I'll be there in ten minutes,|don't worry
{38514}{38540}OK, bye
{38694}{38720}It was a goal
{40254}{40290}Don't you want to put it here?
{40494}{40530}So it won't get cold
{40798}{40822}Pay me
{41274}{41316}Isn't that a pretty picture?
{41364}{41390}It's horrible
{41466}{41510}Well, it's a matter of taste
{41528}{41582}It's a matter|of who fucks over who
{41888}{41948}His parents are fighting|over who gets to keep it
{42036}{42066}Who bought it?
{42096}{42162}They won it in a raffle|at a Christmas party
{42204}{42306}His dad had kept both tickets,|his and his mum's
{42344}{42420}One of them won, but they|were never sure which one it was
{42471}{42518}Chivalry says it was his mother's
{42578}{42684}Let's see -|if you had two raffle tickets...
{42690}{42762}...yours and your boyfriend's,|for a car, say
{42794}{42852}And you won the car...
{42858}{42968}...but you weren't sure|whose ticket was whose
{43024}{43094}Don't tell me you would give it|to your boyfriend?
{43184}{43230}And whose party was it?
{43238}{43266}His mum's
{43364}{43416}Well then,|if his mum hadn't gone...
{43424}{43478}...his father|wouldn't have been there
{43484}{43540}Yes, but if his mum had gone alone...
{43566}{43618}...there would only be one ticket
{43622}{43676}And maybe that wasn't|the winning ticket
{43986}{44010}What?
{44790}{44820}The alarm didn't go off
{44864}{44888}What's your name?
{44950}{44974}Juan Pablo
{45014}{45088}Pablito, you'll help me.|It's your fault my cake burned
{45180}{45224}You should exercise your memory
{45304}{45418}You have to care about something|to remember it, don't you?
{45980}{46022}You'll be hours
{46028}{46144}No I won't. It says here|preparation time is forty minutes
{46176}{46228}Help me chop the strawberries, OK?
{46272}{46296}Yes, sir
{46326}{46350}I know
{46380}{46406}I'm on my way
{46530}{46554}So that's it
{47083}{47111}Now you're fucked!
{47693}{47761}You have to sieve it well|or it will end up lumpy
{48303}{48357}Juan Pablo is John Paul,|like the Pope
{48411}{48457}They call me Moko, with a 'K'
{48549}{48579}My name is Rita
{48797}{48831}I saw the Pope once
{48879}{48989}I mean, I was really little,|when we went with my mum
{48995}{49055}He went down the Insurgentes|and we saw him
{49105}{49151}It was like a miracle, you know?
{49175}{49279}He was going by and all of a sudden|they stopped the Popemobile
{49335}{49399}And he started walking,|you know, all holy
{49419}{49511}And he walked and walked|and went right by me and my mum...
{49519}{49561}...and he stared right at me
{49659}{49725}-And then what?|-Nothing
{49765}{49823}If we don't clean it up,|it will get infected
{50085}{50131}How do you separate the yolks?
{50181}{50229}It doesn't matter,|just toss them in
{50353}{50411}-How old are you?|-Fourteen
{50513}{50537}I'm sixteen
{50623}{50693}-When is your birthday?|-6th June
{50729}{50763}6th June?
{50801}{50881}January, February,|March, April, May, June
{50885}{50939}Sixth of the sixth of... What year?
{50947}{51023}-'90|-1990? Let me see
{51029}{51113}Nine and nine is eighteen...|Ah, no, you're safe
{51117}{51157}From what?
{51163}{51235}From what? From being the Antichrist.|Six, six, six
{51651}{51713}I'm sorry, it squirted out.|Pardon me
{51759}{51805}-If you want, I can...|-No, leave it
{51871}{51913}Sure you don't want any water?
{52337}{52387}Set your watch|for twenty minutes, OK?
{52545}{52621}-Enough, I give up|-Relax
{52627}{52701}You have to be patient|to get the egg whites stiff
{52725}{52761}Yeah, but my arm hurts
{52809}{52869}But you're doing really well,|carry on
{52945}{52977}It's almost ready
{53133}{53161}What do you do...
{53227}{53251}...in life?
{53257}{53311}-I go to school|-Is that all?
{53381}{53453}I listen to music|and play video games
{53579}{53609}I sing in a band
{53671}{53695}A rock band
{53755}{53783}What's it called?
{53845}{53875}A Piece Of Cake
{53993}{54041}Hey, you fell for it!
{54513}{54575}They wouldn't charge me,|but there is a limit
{54661}{54697}You have to be more careful
{55235}{55259}What are those?
{55265}{55331}False nails.|I found them in the bathroom
{55347}{55413}-They're cool, aren't they?|-They're horrible
{55457}{55515}Well, the idea is not for them|to look pretty
{55557}{55581}Give me your arm
{55905}{55937}Relax!
{55953}{55983}I am relaxed
{56187}{56265}Ethologists study animal behaviour
{56313}{56359}I was going to be|a veterinarian but...
{56383}{56461}Lucía said I should study ethology
{56471}{56501}Maybe I should have
{56569}{56649}Lucía was my girlfriend,|but we broke up because...
{56655}{56723}...she said my great aunt|drove her mad
{56801}{56871}I live with my great aunt,|Lucha Elena
{56947}{56985}When I graduated...
{57023}{57087}...I wanted to go back to San Juan
{57107}{57169}But my great aunt|was really sick and...
{57177}{57227}...I had to stay|and take care of her
{57353}{57413}I couldn't find work here...
{57421}{57559}...until one day an uncle|recommended me for a job...
{57607}{57635}...at a dog shelter
{58027}{58079}We used to decide which ones lived...
{58085}{58123}...and which would be put down
{58187}{58223}At first, I wanted to...
{58265}{58371}...save a lot of dogs,|but which ones?
{58397}{58445}They killed them in the end anyway
{58609}{58649}There weren't any homes for them
{59103}{59185}It was like that for six months
{59269}{59327}And they started laying people off
{59375}{59495}The manager said|it was a budgetary luxury...
{59511}{59601}...to decide which dogs lived|and which didn't
{59687}{59735}They offered me the job of...
{59761}{59809}...killing the dogs
{60503}{60527}Until one day...
{60555}{60609}...I noticed...
{60637}{60699}...a patch one of the dogs had|between its eyes
{61323}{61353}And so I held him
{62183}{62213}And then I quit
{62239}{62331}They needed delivery men|at the pizza parlour
{62337}{62399}"Enthusiastic young men|looking to get ahead
{62421}{62519}"Monday to Sunday from twelve|to eight with Wednesdays off"
{62593}{62635}I don't like delivering pizzas
{62675}{62725}But as my Aunt Lucha Elena says...
{62751}{62849}..."Opportunities in life|are like bullets in a shotgun"
{62975}{63017}And I have already fired mine
{63517}{63587}<i>-What's this?</i>|-My lucky coin
{63673}{63701}Keep it
{63813}{63883}Don't heat it in the microwave|or it will get soft
{64447}{64471}Here, try it
{64655}{64679}Is it too hot?
{64727}{64761}It's disgusting!
{64797}{64829}Stop exaggerating!
{64905}{64935}No, it really is awful!
{64941}{65015}One day I bought pair|of yellow parrots
{65021}{65047}The kind that talk
{65077}{65165}And then, about two months later,|they mated
{65171}{65253}About six or seven little parrots
{65263}{65317}And I thought of selling them
{65321}{65409}But the room they were in|was really cold
{65433}{65465}And they died
{65471}{65545}The worst part is|that the pair died too
{65549}{65617}But right away,|l realised that was a great business
{65671}{65743}-So?|-So I'm going to try again
{65759}{65841}Look, with what I get|for my Christmas bonus...
{65847}{65885}...I can buy another pair
{65903}{65951}But as that will be in December...
{65957}{66029}...I will have to have saved|enough for a heater
{66053}{66127}Then, with the heater and the pair...
{66133}{66213}...I'll have to wait another|two months for them to go into heat
{66219}{66319}I hope the female is willing,|they usually are
{66327}{66401}Then, all of a sudden,|you have six or seven baby parrots
{66405}{66477}Then, you have to wait|another month for them to grow up
{66483}{66573}And when they're fully grown,|you could sell each one...
{66577}{66661}...for 2,000 or 2,500,|depending on who buys them
{66715}{66819}I have to save for two months|for the heater
{66825}{66907}I have to wait until December|for the Christmas bonus
{66913}{66967}Then... July, August until December
{66975}{67047}Two months for them to mate,|one month for them to grow up
{67053}{67095}Then I just need to sell them
{67097}{67193}Then I can bring over my Aunt Eugenia|to take care of Aunt Lucha Elena
{67199}{67263}And I can go back to San Juan.|What do you think?
{67271}{67319}I'll be gone within a year
{67559}{67615}We should make brownies,|they're easier
{67649}{67733}-You'll be making them by yourself|-What?
{67737}{67789}I already helped you make a cake
{68051}{68115}-Why don't you close your eyes?|-Why don't you?
{68141}{68171}OK, close them
{68341}{68393}-What?|-It feels funny
{68399}{68437}-What does?|-Your tongue
{68443}{68477}Well, that's the point!
{68503}{68563}Let's try again. Close your eyes
{68849}{68897}We were in the kitchen, you know?
{68913}{68961}We were making a cake
{68967}{69051}She was in the next chair...
{69055}{69097}...beating eggs, I think
{69103}{69167}An I saw her there all alone,|kind of bored
{69171}{69269}And I went up behind her and|started rubbing her back, like this
{69275}{69339}Then her hair... her scalp, like this
{69347}{69411}Then she turned around
{69425}{69481}As she turned,|we looked at each other...
{69489}{69529}...for three or four seconds
{69533}{69617}And I kissed her|for about ten or fifteen seconds
{69655}{69729}And then,|just before the kiss ended...
{69735}{69823}...we kind of pulled apart|and I saw her eyes were open
{69829}{69885}I asked her|why she hadn't closed her eyes
{69893}{69939}And she said, "Why didn't you?"
{69943}{70033}But I did have them closed.|So she said, "OK, let's try again"
{70037}{70069}You know how it is
{70075}{70189}And I said, "Here I come again,|but close your eyes"
{70193}{70313}So I went in again and the kiss|was about ten or fifteen seconds
{70319}{70429}And it was really cool,|but suddenly, she pushed me away
{70437}{70515}I said, "What? Now what?"
{70521}{70599}And she said she felt funny.|And I said, "What?"
{70603}{70685}An she said, "Your tongue".|But that's the point, isn't it?
{70707}{70771}I mean that's the thing|about French kissing
{70775}{70859}Then she said|"Again, but I'll do it to you"
{70865}{70957}So I wanted to play hard to get|and I waited a while
{70967}{71029}And then I got ready|and closed my eyes
{71035}{71101}She has going to kiss me|and just before that...
{71107}{71209}...I could feel her coming close,|about an inch away from my face
{71213}{71299}I didn't know what was happening.|She moved back and sucked my ear
{71307}{71379}She stuck her tongue in like this...|Licking all around
{71449}{71473}Then what?
{71527}{71555}Nothing
{71635}{71675}You really fancy her
{71753}{71783}How do you know?
{71869}{71909}So you do fancy her?
{71939}{71983}How can I tell if I do or not?
{72611}{72649}Did it get like this?
{72679}{72703}No
{72709}{72757}Well, this is a comic,|but more or less?
{72767}{72845}-I didn't look at it|-But you felt it?
{72867}{72891}Yes
{72955}{72999}Then you do bloody fancy her
{73111}{73137}What's that?
{73161}{73199}This knocks them dead
{73883}{73927}Don't suck my ears any more
{74017}{74075}It is easier to make brownies
{74411}{74467}-Can you smell that?|-No
{75067}{75101}Who are you thinking of?
{75145}{75169}What?
{75183}{75213}Are you sure?
{75459}{75487}Is it good?
{75571}{75601}Well, just a little
{75733}{75767}Blonde or brunette?
{75839}{75865}Blonde, right?
{75989}{76037}Why do you all like|blondes so much?
{76077}{76135}Like Lourdes Azcona from 302...
{76141}{76195}...not very pretty,|but she's blonde
{76201}{76243}So everyone is in love with her
{76267}{76313}And I'm not biased, really I'm not
{76387}{76419}but the girl is a retard
{76431}{76483}And I don't think she's very clever
{76515}{76553}I don't think she really cares
{76559}{76625}Or even realises|that she isn't clever
{76667}{76771}Because you need to be clever|to know if you are clever or not
{76819}{76855}I feel sorry for you
{76865}{76967}You're going to be bored to death|when you realise she's not clever
{77019}{77047}Maybe not
{77055}{77121}Maybe you don't care|about being with a clever woman
{77145}{77203}Or maybe you aren't clever either
{77223}{77265}But sooner or later...
{77271}{77337}...you're going to want|to be with someone clever
{77447}{77483}A palindrome
{77945}{78009}1991 is a palindrome
{78197}{78239}I was born in a palindrome
{78299}{78339}Where's the sieve?
{78345}{78395}I'm not going to dye|my hair, you know
{78419}{78493}Besides, the dyes cause cancer.|Did you know that?
{78535}{78617}Besides, it isn't just|a matter of being blonde
{78623}{78709}-It's the easiest thing in the world|to dye your hair, but no
{78715}{78771}You have to be a blonde|and exuberant
{78789}{78887}Because if you're just a blonde,|guys get disappointed
{78909}{78993}That's why I say it's not|so much the hair colour...
{78999}{79031}...it's the attitude
{79181}{79253}Aren't you going to tell me|who you were thinking about?
{79461}{79525}Mum wants to take the picture|with her to Morelia
{79749}{79791}My dad wants it to stay here
{79917}{79963}That's why they are fighting
{79977}{80055}Because that picture|has a lot of sentimental value
{80079}{80141}It reminds them of the year|you were born
{80237}{80293}It was in the cupboard|for thirteen years
{80523}{80563}Set it for twenty minutes, OK?
{80795}{80831}<i>We were at the Techno Motion</i>
{80911}{80943}<i>We were losing</i>
{80971}{81003}<i>It was my turn and I jumped</i>
{81023}{81077}<i>l spun around and landed on both legs</i>
{81277}{81309}<i>And he hugged me</i>
{81499}{81525}Who?
{81553}{81577}Flama
{81585}{81703}Sometimes the ducks feel|a great need to emigrate
{81783}{81857}That doesn't mean that a duck|that emigrates is a bad duck
{81865}{81937}But rather that its nature...
{81955}{81991}...makes it emigrate
{82063}{82113}Seeking new waters...
{82147}{82191}...or warmer climates
{82195}{82231}I don't know. They are ducks
{82323}{82421}And...|are these fantasies recurring?
{82451}{82479}More or less
{82615}{82689}<i>For example, in another|we were in the supermarket</i>
{82702}{82735}<i>It was strange because...</i>
{82773}{82843}<i>...there was no one but him and me</i>
{83071}{83109}<i>And we ate a plum</i>
{83311}{83335}What?
{83359}{83385}Nothing
{83411}{83447}No, what are you thinking?
{83731}{83791}The pizza was for both of us,|dickhead
{83797}{83839}-I'm sorry|-No
{83889}{83923}I'll make you a sandwich
{83973}{84017}-Have you got Cheez Whiz?|-Yes
{84235}{84263}What's up?
{84321}{84381}Fuck, just look at this mess
{84387}{84461}-It's not my fault|-You were with her, wanker
{84467}{84511}And you let her in, wanker
{84529}{84559}Move it
{84587}{84657}-No, my cake isn't done yet|-I don't give a shit
{84689}{84755}The trouble is that your oven|is in Fahrenheit
{84809}{84887}It's harder, because none|of the recipes are in Fahrenheit
{84913}{84971}It's almost done, right?|How long to go?
{84999}{85045}-Five minutes|-Five minutes
{85079}{85123}Wait a minute...
{85273}{85303}<i>Your cake is done</i>
{85353}{85385}Get out!
{85621}{85681}-It's my birthday today|-Happy birthday
{85769}{85799}At home they forgot
{85959}{86027}<i>Happy birthday, dear Rita</i>
{86033}{86103}<i>Happy birthday to me!</i>
{86559}{86595}Truth is...
{86631}{86665}...it is delicious
{87769}{87795}Weed?
{87957}{87993}What was in the jar?
{88139}{88177}Did you put marijuana in it?
{88661}{88705}That sounds bloody brilliant
{89039}{89067}Dry mouth?
{89960}{90024}Taste it! Taste it!
{90374}{90408}Thirty-eight
{90466}{90504}Thirty-nine
{90558}{90594}Forty!
{91380}{91412}Where did you get it?
{91422}{91454}It was my mum's
{91538}{91572}Your mum gets stoned?
{91596}{91628}Only on weekends
{91934}{92006}There are four of us,|like the Beatles
{92052}{92090}The Beatles were all men
{92132}{92166}John Lennon was a woman
{92294}{92354}-Make a wish|-How?
{92364}{92424}You think of a wish,|then think of a colour
{92430}{92484}Bite into it|and if it's your colour...
{92490}{92526}...your wish comes true
{92532}{92556}Look, red
{92642}{92666}Blue
{92720}{92750}Try again
{92792}{92816}Green
{92910}{92936}Yellow
{93354}{93392}Out of sixty-five sweets...
{93414}{93458}...I didn't get any colours right
{93492}{93526}Here we are in Acapulco
{93570}{93612}Here we are in Veracruz
{93658}{93688}You were so sweet
{93694}{93732}That's my cousin Julián
{93806}{93860}Here we are in Cuernavaca
{94002}{94026}What?
{94154}{94178}What?
{94244}{94292}Neither of your parents is ginger
{94482}{94526}Who in your family is ginger?
{94592}{94632}A grandfather, an uncle?
{94976}{95026}Don't be a twat, you're not adopted
{95032}{95072}Neither of my parents is ginger
{95078}{95104}Relax
{95226}{95266}Look. Who's this?
{95310}{95346}My mum, when she was young
{95402}{95442}Do you have one of your father?
{95610}{95652}They look alike, but the hair...
{95726}{95780}The colour changes with age
{95810}{95866}No. Once a ginger, always a ginger
{96048}{96072}Shit!
{96354}{96384}Who's that holding you?
{96428}{96470}I think he's a waiter in Acapulco
{96618}{96650}He has ginger hair
{96722}{96810}Maybe your parents went to Acapulco|and met this poor man...
{96816}{96900}...who couldn't support you|and gave you up for adoption
{97586}{97620}Come on
{97744}{97768}Can you see it?
{97946}{97976}Shit!
{98510}{98550}Are they moving?
{99018}{99038}Are they moving?
{99600}{99648}Do you know why ducks fly in a 'V'?
{99920}{100008}The first duck that takes off|clears the way for the second one
{100040}{100106}The second one clears the air|for the third one
{100124}{100228}The third one's energy impels|the fourth and then...
{100234}{100336}...the fifth and then the sixth
{100390}{100466}And so all the ducks go together...
{100486}{100540}...all sharing|the force of the flight
{100604}{100676}Together they rise...
{100696}{100780}...and soar through the skies
{100830}{100866}And when a duck tires...
{100896}{101002}...the lead duck|goes to the back of the flock
{101042}{101098}And another duck takes its place
{101162}{101216}And they take turns like that
{101222}{101306}One by one,|to the front and then to the back
{101358}{101438}And when a duck|becomes exhausted...
{101486}{101584}...two ducks leave the group|and fly with him
{101654}{101692}Until he recovers
{101738}{101764}Or falls
{103008}{103060}I have to find my real parents
{103188}{103240}I can't live without meeting them
{103632}{103674}Why don't we go to Acapulco?
{104002}{104030}Are you coming?
{104082}{104112}I can't move
{104308}{104334}OK, smile
{104368}{104398}Angry
{104406}{104430}Smile
{104470}{104500}You're the same
{104602}{104640}No fucking way!
{104682}{104760}Why are you so pissed off?|I told you you're not adopted
{104790}{104820}That's the point
{105436}{105470}So, who are you going with?
{105574}{105604}You see that bowl?
{105634}{105736}The other day, they spent two hours|arguing over who got to keep the bowl
{106012}{106066}But the next day,|it's not the bloody bowl
{106072}{106130}It's the dining room|or the fucking dishes
{106138}{106224}They use any fucking thing|as an excuse to fight
{106748}{106824}Let's help them decide|who gets the bloody Chinese vase
{107134}{107164}Ten points
{107178}{107232}That's a souvenir|from their honeymoon
{107542}{107568}Go!
{107654}{107686}Good shot!
{108700}{108724}What?
{108756}{108780}Nothing
{109332}{109404}You haven't asked me|what happened with the cake girl
{109420}{109464}What happened with the cake girl?
{109486}{109548}-l gave her a big kiss|-With tongues?
{109598}{109628}Did you like it?
{109706}{109774}-l liked the ear thing better|-Why?
{109804}{109834}l don't know
{109918}{109948}Close your eyes
{110040}{110098}-And Ill suck your ear|-No
{110160}{110202}So you can see how it feels
{110608}{110670}<i>-Who is it?|-Telepizza, your friendly pizza</i>
{110678}{110718}Does this look extra thin?
{110730}{110762}You are never satisfied
{110770}{110832}All I want is for the Cokes to be...
{110838}{110896}...the way they should be - cold!
{111294}{111322}Hello?
{111334}{111364}Who's calling?
{111382}{111412}Just a moment
{111528}{111534}-It's the manager for you|-Right
{111572}{111598}Hello?
{111650}{111712}Yes, I had a little problem|with a delivery
{111822}{111858}Fuck off!

{112026}{112062}I don't give a shit
{112088}{112134}-Thank you, Flama|-You're welcome
{112924}{112966}Im going with my mum

{113258}{113288}When are you leaving?
{113330}{113404}If the removal men come this week,|on Saturday...
{113634}{113670}No more Sundays
{113856}{113984}SUNDAY 8:00 PM
{114236}{114288}Out of 385 sweets...
{114294}{114338}...I didn't guess a single colour
{114344}{114428}-Well, it's a game|-A bit cruel, isn't it?
{115312}{115346}Congratulations
{115382}{115408}What for?
