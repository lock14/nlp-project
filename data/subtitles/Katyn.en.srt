September 17, 1939

19
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:13,400
Where to, folks?!

20
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,359
There are Germans behind us!

21
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:19,678
The Soviets have entered!

22
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:29,514
Where are you going?
Turn back!

23
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:31,874
The Russkies have entered!

24
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:36,912
Faster!

25
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:39,871
Germans are behind us...

26
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,258
Mrs. Anna! Mrs. Anna!
Where to?

27
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,297
I'm looking for my husband.
Where are they?

28
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:22,496
You don't know?
The Soviets attacked at dawn.

29
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:26,415
My husband told me to return
to Cracow immediately.

30
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:31,453
My husband knows
what's he talking about.

31
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:34,492
- Madam...
- They must know that we're safe.

32
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:38,971
Why jeopardize yourself and the kid?
Be reasonable.

33
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,450
- Madame, please.
- Start.

34
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,406
Nika!

35
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:58,444
Where are you?!
My God, Nika!

36
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:01,483
Nika...

37
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:05,482
Come, doggie.
Nothing to be scared of.

38
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:08,241
I told you to stick with me!

39
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:11,240
He's alone and scared.
Let's take him along.

40
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,518
We can't. We're in a hurry.
He may be waiting for his master.

41
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:21,756
Excuse me, do you
know where the 8th

42
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:26,274
- Cracow Uhlan Regiment is?
- The uhlans are no more.

43
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:29,033
And the officers?
Where's the staff?

44
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,951
There's a hospital
in the church.

45
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:38,550
They may know something.
Ask them.

46
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:29,693
- Is dad there?
- I don't know. We'll see.

47
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:06,360
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti...

48
00:07:14,957 --> 00:07:17,716
- Mom, the coat.
- What coat?

49
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:21,635
Dad's coat.
I can tell by the blue ribbon.

50
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:26,873
Hold this.

51
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:50,585
- What's happening?
- The President's address!

52
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:54,184
The president's address!
Come!

53
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:57,583
...until today has
withstood the onslaught

54
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,501
of the overwhelming
German forces,

55
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:07,699
our eastern neighbor
has invaded our lands in violation

56
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:12,378
of covenants, and the immutable
principles of morality.

57
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:15,297
Warsaw as the capital
is no more!

58
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:20,455
- Who's that?
- Molotov, Soviet Foreign Minister.

59
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:23,934
- The Soviets are everywhere.
- Where are the officers?

60
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:27,972
The POW's are at the station
if they're there.

61
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:32,451
- They were to be transported to Russia.
- Thank you. Hurry up Niki.

62
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:35,530
- You can leave her with me.
- I want to come along.

63
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,769
Wait here.
I'll be back with daddy.

64
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,847
I have another bicycle.
Take this for your husband.

65
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:45,206
- I'll be right back.
- Grzes, see the lady off.

66
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:48,525
Take the bicycle
and leave it there.

67
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:54,723
September 17, 1939

68
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:58,642
The Bolsheviks have entered.

69
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:03,440
Surrounded by Soviet tanks,
we surrender weapons.

70
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,157
They take us for POW's
though there was no war with them.

71
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,796
They have separated the officers
and let the soldiers go home,

72
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,435
but have retained us, the officers.

73
00:09:18,555 --> 00:09:21,954
I'll try to write from time to time
to let you know

74
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:26,752
what happen to me
if I died and didn't return.

75
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:30,351
Maybe this notebook
will be sent to you.

76
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:33,710
- They're dividing us.
- Wait a minute.

77
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,349
What're you doing?

78
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,788
I've decided to describe
everything I've seen here

79
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:40,547
day by day.

80
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:44,666
The Germans take our soldiers,
the Soviets, our officers.

81
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:47,905
Makes no difference.
Captivity is captivity.

82
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:50,344
No honor to an officer.

83
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:53,303
- I see only the dark side.
- Meaning?

84
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:56,702
Moscow hasn't signed
the Geneva Convention.

85
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:09,617
How long do you think
their friendship will last?

86
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:12,536
Hitler declared
a 1000-year-old Reich

87
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,776
and communism is forever.

88
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,414
Greetings to the representatives
of the German Army.

89
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,133
First Lieutenant of the NKVD Kozlov.

90
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,693
A thousand years at least.

91
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:28,131
- You never lose your sense of humor.
- My common sense rather.

92
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,329
- How goes it, comrades?
- Fine.

93
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:37,688
Their alliance won't last a year,

94
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:40,607
which means they'll
need us very badly.

95
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:41,886
Who?

96
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:47,325
One transport to Smolensk,
the second, to Belgorod,

97
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:49,724
and the third to Kharkov.

98
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,482
- Anna? Your wife?
- Why, She's in Cracow.

99
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:01,880
What're you doing here, Anna?
Why aren't you in Cracow?

100
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,479
- Where's Nika?
- Andrzej...

101
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,877
- Andrzej, I thought...
- Where's Nika?

102
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:11,676
You'll see her
in the presbytery.

103
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,755
What presbytery?

104
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:16,794
What presbytery?

105
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:20,193
Nearby. I have another
bicycle for you. Just change.

106
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:23,512
They're not watching closely.
I got thru with no problem.

107
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:25,511
What do you mean?

108
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:27,631
I want you to be with us,

109
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,710
to take care of me
and our daughter.

110
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,789
Anna, listen to me...

111
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:37,307
You're a wife of a Polish officer.

112
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:40,426
This conversation is pointless.

113
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:46,184
Pointless? I've traveled across
half of Poland to you!

114
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,863
I'm bound by my military pledge.

115
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:56,461
You swore to me...
before God.

116
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:59,900
Till death do us part,
you've forgotten?

117
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,779
I swore to them too.

118
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:09,256
You just don't love us.

119
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:13,535
- By God, Anna, calm down.
- I beg you...

120
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:19,653
I beg you, Andrzej...

121
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:23,492
No talking to the prisoner!

122
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:26,251
- Andrzej.
- All will be well.

123
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,849
- Daddy!
- Niki.

124
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,448
Don't go away!

125
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:40,846
Take her.

126
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:45,804
- Take her away.
- Come, darling.

127
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,563
Take care.

128
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,850
Nika!

129
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:35,606
Daddy!

130
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,846
Daddy!

131
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:44,563
Daddy!

132
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,720
THE YOUNGEST CAVALRY CAPTAIN...

133
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:08,835
Maybe the navy blue
would be better?

134
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:13,194
No, thank you, my dear.

135
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:16,073
I thought you were working.

136
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,351
I found an old paper
with Andrzej's photo

137
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:23,430
when he was the youngest
cavalry captain in the Polish Army.

138
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:29,828
Our son lives. He's in captivity,
but he lives.

139
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:36,026
Thank you.

140
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:40,504
- Will you have a speech today?
- Not today.

141
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:45,183
We have to listen to the lecture
of that SS officer... Müller?

142
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:49,181
- I told you.
- We need to buy a new jacket.

143
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:52,100
Müller. Doctor Müller.

144
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:08,095
Does he have
a scientific degree,

145
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:12,693
- that Müller?
- Yes. He calls himself

146
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:18,051
police government adviser.

147
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:20,011
Dr. Müller.

148
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,170
Jan...

149
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,608
...you don't want to go there?

150
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:32,726
Out of the question.
We all must be there.

151
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:35,645
We can't leave
the chancellor alone.

152
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:39,284
The Germans must believe
that we are of one mind

153
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:42,603
when it comes to the independence
of the university.

154
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,199
Cracow, Nov. 6, 1939
German Occupation Zone

155
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:01,197
Hello... hello.

156
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:08,074
Yes, Chancellor.
Hello...

157
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,149
Gentlemen,

158
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:30,986
We have been informed
that, at the university,

159
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:37,624
you start classes, seminars
and exams without our consent.

160
00:17:38,064 --> 00:17:41,303
You don't seem to realize
the plight you're in.

161
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:44,342
This kind of conduct

162
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:51,699
is a hostile act
against Germany.

163
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:59,337
In fact the university was always
a major hotbed of scientific struggle

164
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,536
against Germany, the center
of anti-German propaganda.

165
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:04,335
The university is closed.

166
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:09,133
You all are under arrest.
You'll go to a labor camp

167
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:13,572
where you'll have enough time
to think over your behavior until now.

168
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:17,131
- Excuse me...
- Any discussion is useless.

169
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:22,649
I categorically protest
on behalf of the university.

170
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:26,088
Comments are forbidden.

171
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:28,447
Whoever will try to disobey

172
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,405
orders will be shot.
Chancellor, you go first.

173
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:34,704
November 1939
Camp in Kozielsk, USSR.

174
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:41,702
Everybody fled: Police stations,
high command. I know only one word:

175
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:44,101
- Treason.
- Easy to judge others

176
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:47,380
- when you didn't fight.
- You didn't give me any weapon.

177
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,218
The camp does not justify
a breach of rules and conduct.

178
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:55,177
- It's a fitting term: Treason!
- Soviet propaganda, lieutenant!

179
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:58,576
- The truth is quite different.
- Look for it in Romania,

180
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:02,095
- where our C. -in-C. Has fled.
- Who's guilty

181
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:03,934
that we were unprepared?

182
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:07,173
History will judge
the guilty of the disaster.

183
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:11,372
Rehearsed platitudes, those, I think
though I have fewer stars than you.

184
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:16,090
- I'm an engineer, I design planes.
- The uniform is an honor.

185
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,089
- The Polish uniform.
- Shove the honor. I'd rather fight!

186
00:20:20,248 --> 00:20:24,127
Don't jump at each other's throat.
Here? Before the Soviets?

187
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:29,725
We still take part
in the war.

188
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,404
It's all over with us.

189
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:38,442
Try to find peace with this,
lieutenant.

190
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:09,512
November 1939
Soviet Occupation Zone

191
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:13,270
The Soviet Red Army
is your only friend.

192
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,709
Any further resistance is
pointless.

193
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:21,667
The Soviet Red Army
is your only friend.

194
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:27,665
Only she will liberate
the Polish nation from the war.

195
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:32,264
So that you could
start living in peace.

196
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,898
I can't find it.

197
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:51,137
Silence the baby.

198
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:53,577
- Name?
- Anna.

199
00:21:55,696 --> 00:21:58,975
Wife of a cavalry captain,

200
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:02,414
born in Cracow in 1910,
daughter Nika.

201
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:07,252
This checks out. Everything's correct.
So, what is it, citizen?

202
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:10,651
I already applied twice for travel
documents to Poland...

203
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:13,090
the General-Gouverenment, that is.

204
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:16,169
To my family.

205
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:19,448
Mussolini envies us already.

206
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:22,687
That's what is in our files.

207
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:25,526
And you were refused twice.
So what now?

208
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:28,645
I've applied again.

209
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,362
Refused!
Next one!

210
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:40,241
I used to live in Cracow before
the war. My family lives there.

211
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:44,239
She's a citizen of the General-
Gouvernement. Can she return there?

212
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,279
No!

213
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:49,038
Let me return to Krakow, please.

214
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:53,516
You can return of course,
but you cannot leave from here.

215
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:57,075
It's clear in black and white that
your husband is held

216
00:22:57,235 --> 00:23:01,233
in captivity. Don't you want to
wait till he returns? It's no good.

217
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:06,032
He'll be released and
no one will welcome him.

218
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:10,390
Name?

219
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:23,426
Cracow,
December 24, 1939

220
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:31,463
Where's Ewa?

221
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,621
Outside, looking
for the first star.

222
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:40,420
She wanted to look from here,
but it's the blackout...

223
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,859
Where's the plate for
an unexpected guest?

224
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:48,417
I put it over here
a moment ago.

225
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:51,016
This one is for the General.

226
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:03,132
Good.

227
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:18,386
Sir, I report that the first
star has been sighted.

228
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:20,626
Thank you.

229
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,540
Gentlemen...

230
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:43,538
I have no doubts
that in a year's time

231
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:47,297
we'll reminisce about our
present plight with a smile.

232
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:50,895
None of us thought that
the service prepared us

233
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:55,454
only for immediate victories. Defeat
is also part of the soldier's lot...

234
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:57,253
...and captivity,

235
00:25:57,373 --> 00:26:00,372
but also a return home
to resume fighting.

236
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:05,970
You don't lay down your arms before
an enemy but before yourself.

237
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:11,568
So it's only up to you if you
remain soldiers or losers.

238
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,407
A few words to those,

239
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:19,046
who, not career officers,
share our lot

240
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:23,524
and are the majority here,
as I see scientists, teachers,

241
00:26:23,804 --> 00:26:26,163
lawyers...
I even see a painter.

242
00:26:28,043 --> 00:26:29,522
You must endure,

243
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:34,600
because there won't be a free
Poland without you.

244
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,518
The aim for us, ordinary
soldiers, is to put Poland

245
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:42,518
again on the map of Europe.

246
00:26:43,277 --> 00:26:47,396
Yet you'll have to make
that Poland come true in Europe.

247
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,554
I wish you as well as myself

248
00:26:52,874 --> 00:26:56,353
to return home safe and sound.

249
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:02,111
To meet our nearest and dearest
as soon as possible.

250
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,229
God is born on earth,
powers tremble,

251
00:27:09,348 --> 00:27:13,987
Lord bereft of
heav'nly splendor.

252
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:20,145
Lustrous flames fade,
fires dissemble,

253
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:24,943
Infinite unending Wonder!

254
00:27:25,063 --> 00:27:30,341
Scorned yet clothed
in radiant glory,

255
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:35,779
Mortal though
He is Lord Jesus,

256
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:41,098
Thus the Word
became the flesh,

257
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:46,336
Dwelling without end
among us.

258
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,890
I wonder if they'll let us go.

259
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,009
You can stay here as long
as necessary.

260
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:10,807
Tadek will sure stay with
his uncle and aunt in Miechowo,

261
00:28:10,927 --> 00:28:13,487
while Kazimierz is in Starobielsk...

262
00:28:14,246 --> 00:28:16,485
I've brought a samovar.

263
00:28:24,123 --> 00:28:26,882
This is good medicine.

264
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:29,561
It will help.

265
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:31,440
Thank you.

266
00:28:45,196 --> 00:28:46,795
Mrs. Anna,

267
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:49,834
come to me for
a moment, please.

268
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:54,193
Go. I'll watch over Nika.

269
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:12,066
Please.

270
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:19,864
The tea must've gotten cold.

271
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:29,221
Unfortunately, it has.

272
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,779
Listen to me, Anna.

273
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,978
Please don't get me wrong.

274
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:39,497
I have your lot and that
of your sister at heart.

275
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:44,175
We talked about it, Captain.
That's absolutely impossible.

276
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:47,454
Yes, but the situation
has changed.

277
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:52,213
You were afraid I'd seize the
opportunity if you said yes.

278
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,972
Soon I'm off to
the Finnish front.

279
00:29:55,092 --> 00:30:00,050
It's not the way there like they say.
I've misgivings that I won't come back.

280
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:04,049
You cannot know about that.
Nobody can.

281
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,768
Maybe so.

282
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:10,087
As it happens,

283
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:13,126
we know what
we cannot know.

284
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:17,284
If you marry me, then without

285
00:30:17,404 --> 00:30:20,923
any consequences between us,
as I'm leaving before long.

286
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:25,281
If I'm killed, you as the wife
of a Red Army officer

287
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:29,240
will find it easier to save
yourself and your daughter.

288
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,119
I have a husband.
I won't marry you.

289
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,197
You a wife of a Polish officer.
It spells death.

290
00:30:38,317 --> 00:30:42,076
I told you
I have a husband!

291
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:46,954
- They are no more.
- What're you talking about?

292
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:53,272
I have letters from Andrzej,
who lives and will return.

293
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:55,751
Anna...

294
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:07,947
I know I don't
deserve your trust.

295
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:10,506
We just live
under the same roof.

296
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:13,265
I don't want anything for myself.

297
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:17,903
I'll tell you what
I've no right to say.

298
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,782
Wives of Polish
officers will go first.

299
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:30,059
Once, I wasn't able
to save my own family,

300
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:35,377
but I'd like to rescue
you and your daughter.

301
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:38,696
Please trust me.

302
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:43,255
Please.

303
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,011
- Take two.
- Yes, sir.

304
00:31:55,251 --> 00:31:56,850
Let's go quick!

305
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,920
Nika!

306
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:37,236
- Where's my mommy?
- Quiet, Nika.

307
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:40,675
Open up!

308
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:49,032
Elzbieta Aleksandrowna?

309
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:51,831
Born in Krakow in 1909?

310
00:32:52,151 --> 00:32:55,790
The wife of the Polish Army
officer Kazimierz Ignatowicz?

311
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,189
Pack your things.

312
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:17,223
Jesus...

313
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:31,778
What happened?

314
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:33,137
Fire?

315
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:35,416
What're you doing here?

316
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:39,055
And you?

317
00:33:39,695 --> 00:33:43,214
- I report, Comrade Captain.
- I live here.

318
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,853
- We've come to arrest...
- Who?

319
00:33:47,452 --> 00:33:49,931
Who have you
come to arrest? Me?

320
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:52,211
No.

321
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,850
Here's a warrant.

322
00:33:55,889 --> 00:34:00,248
Anna Aleksandrowna,
born May, 2, 1910...

323
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:04,167
wife of the Polish
officer Andrzej...

324
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:06,806
has a daughter Weronika.

325
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:09,405
No such person lives here.

326
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:13,043
- How come?
- No such person has lived here.

327
00:34:14,203 --> 00:34:19,641
For over a year.
I've lived here... alone.

328
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,279
- So we've come too late?
- Most likely.

329
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,078
Search somewhere else.

330
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:33,636
We certainly will.

331
00:34:40,634 --> 00:34:42,433
Why is the girl crying?

332
00:34:42,753 --> 00:34:46,192
Don't cry! Don't you want
to see your daddy? Be quick!

333
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:48,831
You're going
to your husband.

334
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,018
Niki.

335
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:32,376
Mommy,
not a peep from me.

336
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:34,815
I know, dear.

337
00:35:36,615 --> 00:35:37,934
I know.

338
00:35:45,772 --> 00:35:48,891
- Thank you.
- You must run away.

339
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:51,810
They'll be right back.

340
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,887
Thank you.

341
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,881
The German High Command
announces:

342
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:20,360
The situation near
Narvik hasn't changed.

343
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,198
German planes attacked
British marching columns

344
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:29,157
with MG fire and dispersed them.

345
00:36:29,757 --> 00:36:32,596
Cracow,
Spring of 1940

346
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:35,675
A British cruiser was
hit with a bomb...

347
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,954
My dear God...

348
00:36:40,753 --> 00:36:42,232
You're here.

349
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:47,071
Are you happy, Granny,
we'll be living with you?

350
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,310
I am.

351
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,749
I'm happy...

352
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:54,788
my darling.

353
00:36:57,707 --> 00:37:01,826
- Don't you have dolls, Grandma?
- Well, I didn't have a daughter.

354
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:06,784
This is your dad's teddy bear.

355
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:17,700
It was worst on the border.

356
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,619
I spent all my money and threw
in the ring from Andrzej to boot.

357
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:24,658
When was the last time
he wrote you?

358
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:28,737
In March. Everything
crossed out by the censor.

359
00:37:30,936 --> 00:37:34,335
I'll show you.
Bring me the bag, Nika.

360
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:40,053
Any news from Father?
They let

361
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:43,332
- them write from Sachsenhausen?
- He writes in a way

362
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:46,051
not to provoke the censor.

363
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:48,850
That he's fine,
they feed them well,

364
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,929
and he'll be back soon.

365
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:56,367
- And you don't believe it?
- No...

366
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:00,206
Yes.

367
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:06,244
- I believe my misgivings.
- What do they tell you?

368
00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:09,163
They've been
treating us too well.

369
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:12,082
Let us celebrate Xmas.
It's suspicious.

370
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,001
Don't tell anybody.

371
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:17,920
That 2nd lieutenant
tried to hang himself again.

372
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,319
The men are in bad shape.
We have to set an example.

373
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:22,598
How long?

374
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:25,117
England and France
will stand up for us.

375
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:28,556
They can't leave 20,000
officers behind the front line.

376
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:33,234
Cannons or tanks
can be rebuilt,

377
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:36,313
but a trained soldier
is irreplaceable.

378
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:39,912
I just hope it won't
cross the tovarishchi's minds.

379
00:38:40,072 --> 00:38:42,711
Chin up, lieutenant.

380
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:44,950
You don't look well recently.

381
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,709
It's my kidneys
and I get shivers.

382
00:38:50,149 --> 00:38:52,588
Here's a present for you.

383
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:56,347
- How come? And you?
- I have another.

384
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:59,745
Mother prepared me for the war
as if it were school.

385
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,344
This is her handwriting.
My name.

386
00:39:02,664 --> 00:39:05,983
Thank you.
I'll return it in a few days.

387
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:09,302
No need.
I really have another.

388
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:21,618
Mom,

389
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,657
Mr. Wieslaw's
brought a package for you.

390
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:28,096
- Hello, Madam.
- Hello.

391
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:30,135
It's from Germany.

392
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,894
You have to sign the receipt.

393
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:39,092
One moment. Here.

394
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,529
Thank you.

395
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:50,808
- Please wait.
- Not this time, Madam.

396
00:39:50,928 --> 00:39:52,727
Please forgive me.

397
00:39:57,845 --> 00:39:59,125
Read, please.

398
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:12,720
The Sachsenhausen camp
commander

399
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,798
regrets to inform you that
on March 4, 1940,

400
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:27,915
Prof. Jan died in jail of
an untreated cardiac defect.

401
00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:22,137
- Jesus' holy name be praised.
- For ever and ever.

402
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:47,808
- Here.
- Thank you.

403
00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:55,485
What's that list?

404
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:58,244
The names of all
they transport away.

405
00:41:58,524 --> 00:42:01,803
I have everybody from
the 1 st transport on April 3.

406
00:42:01,923 --> 00:42:06,721
Men are easy to lose, but their families
and the army are waiting for them...

407
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:11,640
- As they say, diaries don't burn.
- Buttons...

408
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,638
That's what will be left of us.

409
00:42:27,674 --> 00:42:29,833
I wonder where they send us?

410
00:42:29,953 --> 00:42:34,072
- To neutral countries maybe.
- Where did you hear that?

411
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:38,630
We were vaccinated against typhus.
With the Soviets that means

412
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,589
- we're off on a long journej.
- Attention!

413
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:44,269
I'm reading
the following names...

414
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:53,745
They've read your name.

415
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:13,658
Your things and off.

416
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:20,016
I'm staying.

417
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:24,815
Don't worry, Jerzy.

418
00:43:24,975 --> 00:43:28,573
This is not the last transport.
You'll come on the next one

419
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:31,093
and I'll get good
lodgings ready.

420
00:44:58,942 --> 00:45:04,860
Zygmunt Szymkiewicz, major doctor,
a letter from a Health Dept.

421
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,099
Cracow,

422
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:12,498

his student card

Edmund Baszkowski
b. In Kalisz in 1903,

429
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:43,087
lawyer.

430
00:45:43,727 --> 00:45:45,686
Marian Dobrowolski,

431
00:45:45,806 --> 00:45:48,725
lieutenant pilot,
engineer designer...

432
00:45:49,805 --> 00:45:53,444
- Goniec Krakowski, please.
- I got the latest. Here.

433
00:45:56,003 --> 00:46:00,961
Stanislaw Jakubowicz
lieutenant, no personal details.

434
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:05,120
Wladyslaw Deszczka,
cartographer,

435
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,038
b. March 2, 1892.

436
00:46:10,158 --> 00:46:15,636

437
00:46:15,756 --> 00:46:19,795

438
00:46:19,955 --> 00:46:24,113

00:46:24,393 --> 00:46:28,792
An inocculation certificate
from Kozielsk attached.

440
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:35,389
Daszkiewicz, 2nd lieut.
ID attached.

441
00:46:45,546 --> 00:46:48,065
- He isn't there?
- No.

442
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:56,622
One cannot lose
a husband and son.

443
00:46:58,062 --> 00:46:59,421
Right.

444
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:05,059
My sonny.
He's not there.

445
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:12,977
But I don't understand why
he didn't hide or escape.

446
00:47:13,137 --> 00:47:15,736
You told me
it was possible.

447
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:20,174
- Why didn't you persuade him?
- You know I tried.

448
00:47:22,093 --> 00:47:25,372
- Why wasn't I there?
- You wouldn't've helped.

449
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:29,051
Andrzej paid the same
duty to the uniform, as Father,

450
00:47:29,171 --> 00:47:32,810
- to the university.
- But he should've been rescued.

451
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:37,568
My son is necessary.

452
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:42,407
You think that
I don't know that?

453
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,726
That I don't feel it?

454
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:49,524
If he'd felt he was needed...
I don't know, maybe...

455
00:47:51,044 --> 00:47:54,682
He wouldn't have left you,
the child, me...

456
00:47:54,802 --> 00:47:57,601
Why do you speak
as if he were no more.

457
00:47:57,721 --> 00:48:00,160
He's not on that list!
Do you hear?

458
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,359
But that accursed list has
the name of that Lieutenant Jerzy

459
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:08,118
- and the general, their commander.
- So what?

460
00:48:08,438 --> 00:48:10,917
He's not there and that's that.

461
00:48:11,077 --> 00:48:13,636
If he could save himself,

462
00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:18,554
even all alone, he did because that's
what I feel. I feel that Andrzej lives.

463
00:48:18,714 --> 00:48:22,113
It can't be that something
happened to him somewhere,

464
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:25,552
which I don't know.
He is part of me.

465
00:48:25,712 --> 00:48:27,991
And no part of me has died.

466
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,709
Yes, yes...

467
00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:59,700
A letter has come, Mom.

468
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:04,698
Official. From the Germans.

469
00:49:05,618 --> 00:49:09,137
- Propaganda Abteilung...
- What can they want from you?

470
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:22,492
In connection with
the Katyn list.

471
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:24,851
They tell relatives
to come.

472
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:29,890
Let's go.

473
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,324
On behalf of our leader
Adolf Hitler,

474
00:49:45,484 --> 00:49:48,523
I'd like to express my
heart-felt condolences

475
00:49:48,683 --> 00:49:53,082
on account of the tragedy that
befell your husband, the General.

476
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,718
It's an unprecedented crime
committed by the Soviets

477
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,797
on Polish POW's in Katyn.

478
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:13,755
The Führer ordered to return
to you the Virtuti Militari cross.

479
00:50:14,874 --> 00:50:16,074
Thank you.

480
00:50:16,394 --> 00:50:20,352
Please see the statement
and next read it.

481
00:50:21,992 --> 00:50:24,671
News spread very fast
of finding...

482
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:28,790
bodies of Polish officers,
including my husband's...

483
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,709
The wife of the General,

484
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:35,027
I'll pray for the Soviet
criminals to be punished...

485
00:50:36,627 --> 00:50:39,826
The conversation
will be recorded.

486
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:46,743
I take it that everything
has been written out here.

487
00:50:46,863 --> 00:50:49,103
Your questions
and my answers.

488
00:50:51,862 --> 00:50:55,340
Exactly. Read it out
loud, please.

489
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,459
You can start now, please.

490
00:51:03,658 --> 00:51:05,937
You can start now, please.

491
00:51:10,775 --> 00:51:11,975
Read it!

492
00:51:15,893 --> 00:51:20,812
Madam, you need this
statement as much as we do.

493
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:28,569
You wouldn't like to send your
daughter letters from Auschwitz?

494
00:51:43,924 --> 00:51:45,763
Please come with me!

495
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,601
The daughter stays here.
Sit down!

496
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:57,039
- Don't you leave me here, Mom!
- Wait here.

497
00:51:57,319 --> 00:51:59,319
Please.

498
00:52:03,437 --> 00:52:06,036
Behind the front line
near Smolensk,

499
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:09,995
the Katyn Forest, the site
of a horrendous mass murder,

500
00:52:10,275 --> 00:52:13,634
where the butchers of Kremlin
ordered executioners

501
00:52:13,794 --> 00:52:17,392
to commit a bestial murder
on 12,000 Polish POW's,

502
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:19,632
officers and noncoms.

503
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:29,748
A German Medical Committee along with
a Polish forensic expert Dr. Praglowski

504
00:52:29,868 --> 00:52:34,786
ascertained the typically Bolshevik
way, a shot in the back of the head.

505
00:52:34,906 --> 00:52:39,545
The exit wound is in the forehead or in
the upper part of the victim's skull.

506
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:55,619
Father Jasinski is performing
exequies over the open mass graves.

507
00:52:58,698 --> 00:53:02,457
A symbolic handful of dust from
the General-Gouvernement

508
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:04,896
is thrown over the graves.

509
00:53:11,534 --> 00:53:16,012
All those Polish offcers were
murdered in the spring of '40.

510
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:19,771
There are many Polish
generals among the victims.

511
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:23,810
This bears out what fate
awaited all European nations

512
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,689
from the Bolshevik
murderous plague.

513
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:31,487
Yet with his heroic attitude, the
German soldier protects our continent.

514
00:53:34,806 --> 00:53:38,405
To complete the list
of names given before

515
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:42,803
of the murdered
by the Bolsheviks...

516
00:53:42,963 --> 00:53:44,403
Mom!

517
00:53:46,322 --> 00:53:47,602
Mom!

518
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:50,880
...we give you further
names of the victims:

519
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,799
Wladyslaw Godziszewski,
lieutenant,

520
00:53:54,919 --> 00:53:59,837
b. June 22, 1895,

521
00:53:59,997 --> 00:54:02,596
high school teacher.

522
00:54:03,596 --> 00:54:06,875
Lucjan Gawronski,
captain,

523
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:11,953
Olgierd Druchowicz, major,
electrical engineer.

524
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:18,991
Cracow, Jan. 18, 1945
- The hated Nazi flag hit the

525
00:54:19,311 --> 00:54:23,629
cobblestones of the Krakow marketplace.
Thousands of hands tore into pieces

526
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:27,788
the symbol of German rule over
the ancient capital of Polish kings.

527
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:12,213
Mom, see who's arrived?

528
00:55:12,373 --> 00:55:14,652
Our maid Stasia.

529
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:22,209
How elegant you look!

530
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:24,009
Stasia...

531
00:55:26,288 --> 00:55:30,566
- So we've survived.
- Yes...

532
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:33,565
Sit down.

533
00:55:35,405 --> 00:55:37,284
We worried about you.

534
00:55:38,004 --> 00:55:39,723
Well, it was hard.

535
00:55:41,882 --> 00:55:43,682
We had to hide.

536
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:49,760
My husband took to the forest.
He was in the People's Army.

537
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:56,477
- Could we help you?
- No, thank you.

538
00:55:56,597 --> 00:55:59,636
It's quite different now.

539
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,875
My husband Edek
can do a great deal now.

540
00:56:02,995 --> 00:56:05,594
Your things remained
here in the pantry,

541
00:56:05,754 --> 00:56:08,633
a whole trunk.
Ewa, fetch it please.

542
00:56:08,953 --> 00:56:11,232
Madam, I'd like...

543
00:56:12,552 --> 00:56:14,711
You remember?

544
00:56:14,831 --> 00:56:17,310
I'd like to return it.

545
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,189
I promised to keep it
and I did.

546
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,467
What have you
brought us?

547
00:56:36,264 --> 00:56:37,903
Dad's saber...

548
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:45,821
Thank you very much.

549
00:56:53,178 --> 00:56:55,657
- So I'll be going...
- Your trunk.

550
00:56:55,777 --> 00:57:00,576
No, no, give it to the Red
Cross for the poor.

551
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:04,534
My husband was nominated
the Starosta of Piotrkow.

552
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,573
So I have to go.

553
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:17,730
I thought you decided
to stay on as a maid.

554
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,969
I didn't see the General's
wife throughout the whole war.

555
00:57:21,288 --> 00:57:23,648
Now you are the lady.

556
00:57:24,727 --> 00:57:27,166
Yes, Madam, please.

557
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:08,712
Dad!

558
00:58:10,911 --> 00:58:13,710
- Andrzej.
- Dad!

559
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,630
Andrzej.

560
00:58:26,346 --> 00:58:29,585
Nika...
She's grown.

561
00:58:34,823 --> 00:58:36,583
Forgive her.

562
00:58:36,703 --> 00:58:39,862
She's looking forward to
seeing Father.

563
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:43,260
I'm sorry
to have disappointed you.

564
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,779
- But your face...
- You recognize me?

565
00:58:49,418 --> 00:58:52,577
You're Jerzy, a lieutenant
from my son's regiment.

566
00:58:53,297 --> 00:58:55,696
Yes, a major now, but it's me.

567
00:58:55,856 --> 00:58:58,455
But they said you were dead.

568
00:59:02,814 --> 00:59:05,693
I saw the name and rank

569
00:59:05,853 --> 00:59:09,411
- on the list everything...
- Yes, yes, but it's a mistake.

570
00:59:09,531 --> 00:59:11,691
I live as you see.

571
00:59:11,811 --> 00:59:13,890
Where's Andrzej?

572
00:59:15,449 --> 00:59:18,568
Do you know my son's
whereabouts?

573
00:59:20,728 --> 00:59:23,247
Unfortunately,

574
00:59:24,646 --> 00:59:26,885
I saw him
in 1940 last

575
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:29,804
when they took him
to another camp.

576
00:59:33,683 --> 00:59:35,482
That means...

577
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:38,561
Nobody knows,
and nothing is certain.

578
00:59:38,681 --> 00:59:41,880
So many mistakes.
You live...

579
00:59:48,438 --> 00:59:50,797
Anna will be happy.

580
00:59:52,677 --> 00:59:54,796
She'll be back soon.

581
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:59,554
I have some canned meat for you.
It can be of use...

582
00:59:59,674 --> 01:00:02,353
Thank you.

583
01:00:25,145 --> 01:00:26,465
Jerzy.

584
01:00:28,824 --> 01:00:34,102
- Why, you are on the Katyn list.
- I know. I've come...

585
01:00:35,662 --> 01:00:37,461
This is for you.

586
01:00:37,581 --> 01:00:38,861
Thank you.

587
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,099
You live.

588
01:00:46,538 --> 01:00:48,697
Where's Andrzej?
Do you know?

589
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:51,297
His name is not on the list.

590
01:00:51,456 --> 01:00:55,535
- I'm in place for him.
- What do you mean?

591
01:00:55,655 --> 01:01:00,253
The captain had a sweater
with my name.

592
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:05,132
Oh, God...

593
01:01:05,252 --> 01:01:09,770
Mrs. Anna. It doesn't mean
a thing. You should have...

594
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:11,650
Hope?

595
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:16,248
I've been living hope for five years,
so don't you tell me about it.

596
01:01:18,647 --> 01:01:22,246
You've come to tell me
that my husband is dead, yes?

597
01:01:22,366 --> 01:01:25,845
- You want to tell me that he's dead...
- Yes.

598
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:56,514
He said that Andrzej is dead.

599
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:17,646
Mrs. Greta...

600
01:03:10,409 --> 01:03:13,768
Soviets of the NKVD
are on the premises.

601
01:03:14,048 --> 01:03:16,487
Have you seen them?
Calm down.

602
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:19,806
They'll take us away
when they find this.

603
01:03:20,086 --> 01:03:22,245
They'll take us away anyway.

604
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,082
Hide all of this immediately.

605
01:03:38,199 --> 01:03:41,518
What are you doing here?
Do you have an order?

606
01:03:41,638 --> 01:03:44,597
I have an appointment
with the professor.

607
01:03:46,677 --> 01:03:50,315
Sir, the man says he
has an appointment with you.

608
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:52,634
I don't remember.

609
01:03:53,274 --> 01:03:56,353
You have a warrant, major?

610
01:03:57,793 --> 01:04:00,232
You don't remember me?

611
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:08,389
Jerzy... How come you here?
In this uniform?

612
01:04:09,389 --> 01:04:11,708
I came too late to Anders.

613
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:15,267
But for that, I would
be in London now.

614
01:04:17,266 --> 01:04:19,745
I'm here in private, sir.

615
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:22,544
You know that I'm
on the Katyn list?

616
01:04:24,184 --> 01:04:27,782
Forgive me, but I don't
know the list by heart.

617
01:04:33,301 --> 01:04:36,420
Things with my name
were my commander's.

618
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:39,019
That's why I've come here.

619
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,138
I think that his family

620
01:04:41,258 --> 01:04:44,577
would like to get them
before you pack them.

621
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:52,054
Have you found
an envelope with my name?

622
01:04:52,254 --> 01:04:54,133
I don't remember.

623
01:04:54,493 --> 01:04:58,572
How many names of your former
students could you have found here?

624
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:05,090
Dozens, sir.

625
01:05:13,127 --> 01:05:14,766
This is...

626
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:19,125
the address of the captain's wife.

627
01:05:21,044 --> 01:05:23,443
If you could find anything...

628
01:05:24,763 --> 01:05:27,122
I know you don't trust me.

629
01:05:27,242 --> 01:05:30,201
But it's not the point
that I've survived,

630
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:35,039
am in the new service,
in a new Poland, but you aren't.

631
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:37,799
That's not the point.

632
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:44,756
To you, this is just evidence,
but to her it may be relics.

633
01:05:46,236 --> 01:05:47,355
Aha.

634
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:36,578
On the strength of the decision
of the Extraordinary State Committee

635
01:06:36,738 --> 01:06:40,337
concerning the investigation
of the murder committed

636
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:44,536
by the German invaders,
a special commission was appointed

637
01:06:44,696 --> 01:06:48,614
to ascertain the circumstances
of the crime committed on Polish

638
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:51,333
officer POW's in the Katyn Forest.

639
01:06:51,453 --> 01:06:56,252
Each body underwent
detailed autopsy.

640
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:10,767
A shot in the back of the head,

641
01:07:11,087 --> 01:07:14,405
the favorite way of killing
of Gestapo murderers.

642
01:07:16,765 --> 01:07:20,763
Judging by autopsies, brains,
and clothes, we can determine

643
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:24,362
that the Polish POW's
were murdered not

644
01:07:24,522 --> 01:07:27,721
earlier than in the fall of 1941.

645
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,599
The Germans committed
the murder with utter cynicism,

646
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:37,198
which the bullet
wounds bear out.

647
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:40,636
That's how they shot the Poles.

648
01:07:40,996 --> 01:07:45,635
Delegations of the 1 st
Polish Corps in the USSR

649
01:07:46,035 --> 01:07:48,994
have come for the exequies.

650
01:07:49,114 --> 01:07:50,713
HONOR TO THE FALLEN

651
01:07:52,712 --> 01:07:56,631
During the ceremony,
the priest told the participants:

652
01:07:56,751 --> 01:08:00,230
"May the shed Polish
blood be a foundation

653
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:04,508
of our revived free homeland."

654
01:08:26,581 --> 01:08:29,140
- What's the matter?
- It's a lie.

655
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,699
It's a lie. Do you hear?

656
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:38,297
Please come with me.

657
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:40,096
It's a lie.

658
01:08:41,376 --> 01:08:42,735
Madam...

659
01:08:45,694 --> 01:08:47,614
Where do you know me?

660
01:08:47,734 --> 01:08:52,052
I received a commission
from the General before the war.

661
01:09:06,047 --> 01:09:08,446
I was there a year ago.

662
01:09:08,566 --> 01:09:10,046
Where?

663
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:15,084
In Katyn when the Soviets
sent us to the graves.

664
01:09:15,244 --> 01:09:17,363
What were you doing
there?

665
01:09:20,082 --> 01:09:23,681
Stalin needed us, officers
of the 1 st Corps, to testify

666
01:09:23,961 --> 01:09:27,040
about the impartiality
of their investigation.

667
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,399
- And?
- We did.

668
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:39,676
It's a lie.
And you know it.

669
01:09:39,956 --> 01:09:42,595
- They had eye-witnesses.
- Major...

670
01:09:42,715 --> 01:09:46,713
The Soviets must lie to cover up
the crime, but you don't have to.

671
01:09:47,033 --> 01:09:49,033
You mustn't.

672
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:51,512
I saw them...

673
01:09:51,672 --> 01:09:55,070
pull out of the pits
those I was with in Kozielsk.

674
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:58,429
I watched in disbelief
that I lived,

675
01:09:58,549 --> 01:10:01,708
whereas I should've
been there with them.

676
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:07,666
You should... major...
testify about the truth.

677
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:11,105
I could just as well
shoot myself in the head.

678
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,259
You salute murderers
as if they were victors.

679
01:10:28,379 --> 01:10:31,498
Makes no difference
whether Soviets or Germans.

680
01:10:31,658 --> 01:10:34,457
Nobody will resurrect
the dead anyway.

681
01:10:35,617 --> 01:10:39,175
We have to survive, forgive.

682
01:10:39,455 --> 01:10:41,055
We must live.

683
01:10:44,054 --> 01:10:46,053
You're the same as they.

684
01:10:48,132 --> 01:10:52,251
You may think differently,
but you do the same.

685
01:10:52,411 --> 01:10:56,330
What does it matter
that you think differently?

686
01:11:06,966 --> 01:11:10,245
The Katyn graves opened up

687
01:11:10,405 --> 01:11:15,003
for the third time
to reveal to the world

688
01:11:15,123 --> 01:11:17,482
the terrifying truth

689
01:11:17,642 --> 01:11:22,401
about still another
German murder

690
01:11:22,521 --> 01:11:27,039
committed on the Polish nation.

691
01:11:30,278 --> 01:11:35,236
- Will you drink?
- Miss Krysia, pour one for the major.

692
01:11:35,356 --> 01:11:40,274
- I'm cold after the service.
- They premiere a Soviet film in town.

693
01:11:40,434 --> 01:11:43,353
- What?
- Haven't you heard?

694
01:11:43,473 --> 01:11:47,432
A dozen thousand of our officers
were murdered in Katyn.

695
01:11:47,552 --> 01:11:52,350
- What're you talking about?
- To the victory over those criminals.

696
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:54,230
Jerzy!

697
01:11:55,029 --> 01:11:59,228
- What're you talking about, dammit?
- About the historical truth.

698
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:00,947
Miss Krysia,

699
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,466
vodka for everyone.

700
01:12:04,626 --> 01:12:07,065
The whole world didn't know...

701
01:12:07,225 --> 01:12:10,184
what to think about
that crime.

702
01:12:12,343 --> 01:12:15,462
There were horrible
rumors that

703
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:19,141
no one knew who and how...

704
01:12:20,181 --> 01:12:22,620
- But it's plain that...
- Stop it!

705
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,419
...it was the Germans in '41

706
01:12:25,579 --> 01:12:28,578
murdered everyone shooting
in the back of the head.

707
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:32,497
Piss off. You're drunk.

708
01:12:32,617 --> 01:12:34,936
- Miss Krysia.
- Don't pay.

709
01:12:38,095 --> 01:12:40,614
I want to pay
in memory of them.

710
01:12:45,212 --> 01:12:47,491
Get out of here.
You're drunk.

711
01:12:48,251 --> 01:12:51,570
Look, the people can be silenced.

712
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,969
You don't know
what you're talking about.

713
01:12:55,089 --> 01:12:57,008
That's why I'm talking!

714
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:00,407
You fool.

715
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:29,637
I don't know what I'm saying?
You all know the same.

716
01:13:30,917 --> 01:13:32,316
All.

717
01:13:33,196 --> 01:13:37,234
And you, and you,
and you.

718
01:13:37,394 --> 01:13:39,394
Get out of here!

719
01:13:44,072 --> 01:13:46,631
The Katyn Forest blood

720
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:51,190
is calling to us out loud...

721
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:55,868
calling us to take a merciless...

722
01:13:55,988 --> 01:13:58,147
revenge...

723
01:13:59,027 --> 01:14:01,186
Not for a moment are we

724
01:14:01,346 --> 01:14:04,265
allowed to forget

725
01:14:04,985 --> 01:14:08,584
about the terrible
death of our brothers...

726
01:14:10,463 --> 01:14:12,582
who were later dumped

727
01:14:12,902 --> 01:14:15,341
into a common pit...

728
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:19,940
and next dragged out of the pit...

729
01:14:22,979 --> 01:14:27,257
those jackals and hyenas.

730
01:14:28,457 --> 01:14:32,256
POW's were murdered

731
01:14:32,376 --> 01:14:35,415
in cold blood

732
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:39,373
calmly, systematically.

733
01:14:41,412 --> 01:14:44,811
Dumped into a common pit,

734
01:14:44,971 --> 01:14:50,569
professional officers,
engineers, doctors...

735
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:56,167
- What's your name?
- Lieutenant Klin.

736
01:14:56,287 --> 01:14:59,446
You'll be a witness.
Take him. Quick!

737
01:15:09,203 --> 01:15:12,922
Over 10,000 of Polish
intelligentsia,

738
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:17,960
whom the war dressed
in military uniforms.

739
01:15:31,955 --> 01:15:35,954
Agnieszka, I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

740
01:15:40,112 --> 01:15:44,031
News from the rising raised
doubts if anyone had survived.

741
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,910
I lucked up.

742
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:48,789
Thank God.

743
01:15:49,429 --> 01:15:52,348
My sister said
you were looking for me.

744
01:15:53,188 --> 01:15:56,267
I asked her to get in touch,
but she never came.

745
01:15:56,387 --> 01:16:00,505
Nothing will change her
and she won't return to church.

746
01:16:00,785 --> 01:16:04,344
You'll be disappointed in me.
I haven't come to pray.

747
01:16:06,143 --> 01:16:07,943
I was there.

748
01:16:08,823 --> 01:16:10,382
There?

749
01:16:12,261 --> 01:16:15,140
Over the Katyn graves

750
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,259
in 1943.

751
01:16:23,058 --> 01:16:28,336
In my presence, this rosary was
pried out of your brother's hand.

752
01:16:37,853 --> 01:16:43,131
You recognized him?
How?

753
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:49,129
By his service papers.

754
01:17:24,517 --> 01:17:27,316
I didn't want him
to look so serious.

755
01:17:31,074 --> 01:17:34,233
It was snapped when
he was appointed lieutenant.

756
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:39,512
He wasn't a professional officer,

757
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:43,830
but an engineer designer,
building a new sports plane.

758
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:46,429
He looks so glum,

759
01:17:46,549 --> 01:17:50,108
rather than happy
as he usually was.

760
01:17:50,268 --> 01:17:53,387
- May I?
- A pity I didn't have another photo.

761
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:56,826
I'll try to make
him look smiling.

762
01:17:56,946 --> 01:17:59,865
But it's a very beautiful photo.
I wanted to ask

763
01:17:59,985 --> 01:18:02,184
you if I could make a copy.

764
01:18:04,103 --> 01:18:05,823
Yes?

765
01:18:06,902 --> 01:18:09,261
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

766
01:18:09,381 --> 01:18:12,180
It didn't bring us luck.

767
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:16,139
It'll be ready tomorrow.

768
01:18:32,293 --> 01:18:35,252
Please come tomorrow.
Excuse me.

769
01:18:46,009 --> 01:18:47,128
Tadzio?

770
01:18:49,288 --> 01:18:50,287
Aunt.

771
01:18:51,847 --> 01:18:54,286
- Tadzio.
- Aunt Anna.

772
01:18:54,406 --> 01:18:56,285
- Tadzio.
- Hello, Aunt.

773
01:18:56,405 --> 01:18:59,004
God! What're you
doing here?

774
01:18:59,124 --> 01:19:01,923
You've grown so tall
that I hardly recognize you.

775
01:19:03,523 --> 01:19:06,002
And Ela?
Any news about mom?

776
01:19:06,122 --> 01:19:08,881
None since they took her away.
I thought you...

777
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:13,080
No. No answer to so many
letters I sent.

778
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,159
You know about Father.

779
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:17,238
He's on the list.

780
01:19:17,358 --> 01:19:20,157
Everything tallies:
The number, rank...

781
01:19:22,076 --> 01:19:24,076
- Good bye...
- Good bye.

782
01:19:24,196 --> 01:19:27,315
Where have you been?
With the aunt and uncle?

783
01:19:27,475 --> 01:19:30,753
After they took Mom with Halinka,
I stayed with the uncle.

784
01:19:30,873 --> 01:19:33,473
- There was nothing to return to.
- I worked in

785
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:37,071
a factory. When I turned 18
in the Kielce Province then.

786
01:19:37,191 --> 01:19:40,110
- In Kielce or in the country?
- Neither.

787
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:44,149
Tadzio...

788
01:19:59,384 --> 01:20:00,863
Thank you.

789
01:20:19,337 --> 01:20:20,376
Come...

790
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:23,455
Come, Tadzio.

791
01:20:25,135 --> 01:20:29,293
Mr. Wladyslaw, my nephew
has come to have his pictrue

792
01:20:29,453 --> 01:20:31,213
- taken.
- Yes, sir.

793
01:20:32,292 --> 01:20:34,332
What size photo?

794
01:20:34,452 --> 01:20:36,851
A passport photo.

795
01:20:37,011 --> 01:20:40,250
I read in the paper that
the Fine Arts Academy

796
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:43,329
is going to be opened.
If I start a new life...

797
01:20:43,449 --> 01:20:45,088
Wonderful.

798
01:20:46,248 --> 01:20:50,726
I like to draw.
Take a look, Aunt.

799
01:20:59,163 --> 01:21:03,802
Mrs. Anna we again have
college students in Poland.

800
01:21:03,962 --> 01:21:06,241
Exactly! And how clever.

801
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:08,720
Please follow me.

802
01:21:27,234 --> 01:21:29,193
To the left.

803
01:21:29,793 --> 01:21:32,752
My left, your right.

804
01:21:50,945 --> 01:21:53,904
In high school,
students don't smoke, sir.

805
01:21:55,224 --> 01:21:56,464
Sorry.

806
01:21:57,143 --> 01:22:02,062
- You fought in the forest?
- Yes, but there's an amnesty.

807
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:06,100
I see that you
attended secret classes.

808
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:11,139
You should get credits
for the senior year

809
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,697
and try to get a high school
diploma after intensive courses.

810
01:22:14,817 --> 01:22:17,137
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wonderful!

811
01:22:19,296 --> 01:22:22,095
Anything else?
Why are you staring at me?

812
01:22:22,215 --> 01:22:25,854
- Because I've seen you.
- Where?

813
01:22:26,013 --> 01:22:28,693
In a photo in
a photographic studio.

814
01:22:28,813 --> 01:22:31,212
Along with
a couple under a plane.

815
01:22:31,372 --> 01:22:35,010
- He was in a pilot's uniform.
- Which studio?

816
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:38,889
- Near the marketplace?
- Yes.

817
01:22:39,009 --> 01:22:41,368
- Madam...
- Yes?

818
01:22:41,648 --> 01:22:43,208
Come here for a moment.

819
01:22:43,368 --> 01:22:45,007
Good bye.

820
01:22:46,407 --> 01:22:48,646
Wait a minute.

821
01:22:48,886 --> 01:22:51,365
We have a problem here.

822
01:22:51,645 --> 01:22:54,084
- What?
- Your father.

823
01:22:54,204 --> 01:22:56,203
What about him?

824
01:22:56,723 --> 01:22:58,962
What did you write here?

825
01:23:02,761 --> 01:23:06,800
Something not clear? The Soviets
murdered him in Katyn in 1940.

826
01:23:17,996 --> 01:23:22,314
- I must lie about my father?
- Be reasonable.

827
01:23:22,434 --> 01:23:25,313
- In the forest...
- You're not in the forest.

828
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:30,192
- Your opponents are not Germans.
- This is treason, Madam.

829
01:23:30,311 --> 01:23:34,950
I only care for you to get the diploma.
This country must be raised from ruins.

830
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:38,389
Who'll do it if you all
let yourselves get killed.

831
01:23:40,068 --> 01:23:43,987
You'll make corrections
in your CV, yes?

832
01:23:51,384 --> 01:23:54,343
One have only one CV, Madam.

833
01:23:57,982 --> 01:24:00,141
What do we do about him?

834
01:24:00,261 --> 01:24:04,900
Your attitude to Katyn bespeaks
your loyalty to People's Poland.

835
01:24:06,779 --> 01:24:09,258
I admit him and
you see to it

836
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:12,857
that he be reasonable.

837
01:24:12,977 --> 01:24:16,256
You're his home
room teacher, right?

838
01:24:17,695 --> 01:24:22,973
- What if Poland becomes free?
- There will never be a free Poland.

839
01:24:23,093 --> 01:24:25,213
Mark my words.

840
01:24:27,172 --> 01:24:28,612
Never.

841
01:24:54,363 --> 01:24:57,682
I don't know Cracow.
Where do I run away?

842
01:25:16,115 --> 01:25:19,634
- Have you seen a boy in a brown coat?
- No, no, no.

843
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:04,279
The coast is clear.

844
01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:11,156
- Will we meet again?
- I don't know.

845
01:26:11,276 --> 01:26:14,435
But we will for sure.
It's destiny.

846
01:26:14,555 --> 01:26:20,193
Maybe... if you think so.
Yes, we'll meet.

847
01:26:20,313 --> 01:26:22,792
That's not what I think.
I want it.

848
01:26:24,232 --> 01:26:25,671
So do I.

849
01:26:27,271 --> 01:26:29,230
The world's laughing.

850
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:31,669
THE WORLD'S LAUGHING

851
01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:36,428
- I've never been to the movies.
- No kidding.

852
01:26:36,548 --> 01:26:40,626
Haven't you seen that Disney's
The Sleeping Beauty, remember?

853
01:26:40,786 --> 01:26:43,066
But that doesn't count.

854
01:26:43,225 --> 01:26:46,144
I've never sat with a girl
on the rooftop.

855
01:26:46,264 --> 01:26:49,343
Tomorrow in the movie house?

856
01:26:49,463 --> 01:26:50,423
At 6 pm?

857
01:26:51,383 --> 01:26:52,662
Good.

858
01:27:24,091 --> 01:27:26,451
Freeze or I'll shoot!

859
01:28:34,187 --> 01:28:35,667
Are you sure?

860
01:28:37,067 --> 01:28:39,786
We'll plait a braid first.

861
01:28:42,585 --> 01:28:44,584
You are saving my role.

862
01:28:45,504 --> 01:28:48,143
No character without hair, right?

863
01:28:48,263 --> 01:28:51,821
Those Germans who worked
at the theater during the occupation

864
01:28:52,141 --> 01:28:55,660
took all the wigs away,
didn't leave anything.

865
01:28:55,780 --> 01:29:00,538
- We'll plait a thick braid.
- What if I let the hair down?

866
01:29:02,178 --> 01:29:06,097
It won't grow after the camp.
It was Auschwitz, you see?

867
01:29:09,575 --> 01:29:13,254
It's a pity to cut it off.
Does your husband know?

868
01:29:13,494 --> 01:29:15,253
Do your duty.

869
01:29:18,372 --> 01:29:20,572
Don't you worry.
He'll return.

870
01:29:20,692 --> 01:29:25,330
Yesterday a technical help
from our theater returned.

871
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:27,769
All of us had bewailed him.

872
01:29:34,687 --> 01:29:38,605
Why live with
so much evil around?

873
01:29:39,565 --> 01:29:41,524
Lt'd be a true misfortune

874
01:29:41,644 --> 01:29:45,363
if my brother were left
without a grave after his death.

875
01:29:45,763 --> 01:29:47,762
And the rest.

876
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:50,002
It's indifferent to me.

877
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,760
Do you think I'm mad?

878
01:29:56,039 --> 01:29:59,678
How to judge a mad woman...

879
01:29:59,798 --> 01:30:03,437
...before the tribunal
of a madman?

880
01:30:05,156 --> 01:30:10,634
Who puts on a wig of someone's
hair, assumes his lot.

881
01:30:12,234 --> 01:30:15,033
I wouldn't wish that
on my worst enemy.

882
01:30:43,103 --> 01:30:46,022
- Count it.
- Would you like to see it?

883
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:52,060
LIEUTENANT PILOT

884
01:31:06,135 --> 01:31:08,455
You're looking for someone?

885
01:31:08,575 --> 01:31:11,254
I have an appointment
with the Canon.

886
01:31:11,374 --> 01:31:13,733
- The Canon is not here.
- So I'll wait.

887
01:31:16,692 --> 01:31:19,611
But he was taken away
last night.

888
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:24,169
- Last night?
- Last night.

889
01:31:25,329 --> 01:31:30,007
When the Germans dug out
the graves in Katyn in 1943,

890
01:31:30,127 --> 01:31:33,726
the Canon said Mass there?
Those from the International

891
01:31:34,006 --> 01:31:37,325
Red Cross who were there,
the NKVD arrested long ago.

892
01:31:37,445 --> 01:31:40,404
But I've brought a plaque
of my brother.

893
01:31:40,524 --> 01:31:43,683
- Did the Canon agree?
- Yes.

894
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:51,960
Lieutenant Pilot

895
01:31:53,559 --> 01:31:57,198
killed in Katyn in April 1940.

896
01:31:59,517 --> 01:32:02,276
But I cannot
put it up in the church.

897
01:32:02,396 --> 01:32:06,515
I thought temples differed from
government offices or papers.

898
01:32:09,474 --> 01:32:13,273
Those who took the Canon
away said they knew

899
01:32:13,392 --> 01:32:17,191
all enemies of the people's
power, including the Lord God.

900
01:32:17,351 --> 01:32:21,750
The Soviets did it in '40.
Everyone knows about it.

901
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:25,428
- You must agree.
- Did you think about the living?

902
01:32:25,548 --> 01:32:29,027
How this plaque may
change the lot of the Canon?

903
01:32:36,145 --> 01:32:38,424
Take it away.

904
01:33:08,734 --> 01:33:10,693
What do you want to do?

905
01:33:11,013 --> 01:33:14,971
To put it on our tomb
before it can hang in the church.

906
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:22,329
- Where have you been so long?
- What would you like to know?

907
01:33:22,489 --> 01:33:25,968
- You could sometimes drop a line.
- Have you forgotten that...

908
01:33:26,088 --> 01:33:29,566
- we had a brother?
- No, I haven't.

909
01:33:30,966 --> 01:33:32,685
So help me.

910
01:33:35,564 --> 01:33:38,683
- You're afraid.
- You know I can't.

911
01:33:39,003 --> 01:33:41,122
Join the Party.
That gives power.

912
01:33:42,162 --> 01:33:46,521
It's not that way. It's a different
time and no one will free

913
01:33:46,681 --> 01:33:50,399
us from it neither during
our life or that of our children.

914
01:33:50,519 --> 01:33:52,399
You've joined already.

915
01:33:55,478 --> 01:33:58,197
Even the Rising
taught you nothing.

916
01:33:58,317 --> 01:34:03,475
You won't change this world.
We can let them deport or kill us.

917
01:34:03,595 --> 01:34:08,073
Or build as much freedom
as we can here,

918
01:34:08,233 --> 01:34:10,712
as much Polish identity
as we can.

919
01:34:11,032 --> 01:34:13,631
You're too wise
not to understand that.

920
01:34:13,911 --> 01:34:16,910
You've found a place in
this new world of yours,

921
01:34:17,070 --> 01:34:20,549
whereas I am whole
in that where Piotr is.

922
01:34:20,669 --> 01:34:24,468
If I must choose,
I stay with him.

923
01:34:25,027 --> 01:34:27,547
You choose the dead,
which is morbid.

924
01:34:27,667 --> 01:34:32,065
No. I choose the murdered,
not the murderers.

925
01:34:49,019 --> 01:34:51,019
How long will it take?

926
01:34:51,139 --> 01:34:54,457
The work - 20 minutes,
but later even less.

927
01:34:56,057 --> 01:34:57,656
I don't understand.

928
01:34:57,976 --> 01:35:00,095
You asked how long
it would take.

929
01:35:19,569 --> 01:35:21,368
Do your work.

930
01:35:40,562 --> 01:35:45,360
I hear that you spread
false information about Katyn.

931
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,959
What do you think is false?

932
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:51,478
My brother's letter from

933
01:35:51,638 --> 01:35:54,237
April 6, 1940 is true.

934
01:35:54,357 --> 01:35:56,996
You know it was the Germans.

935
01:35:58,595 --> 01:36:02,194
You put a plaque in the cemetery

936
01:36:02,314 --> 01:36:05,273
with a false date of your
brother's death in 1940.

937
01:36:05,433 --> 01:36:09,632
- To slander the Soviet comrades?
- I'm interested in the truth.

938
01:36:09,912 --> 01:36:12,231
The truth is a given.

939
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:15,310
The Russians persuade
all it was the Germans.

940
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:18,469
The Germans accuse the Russians.
Even the Polish

941
01:36:18,629 --> 01:36:22,227
- government did not explain the affair.
- Hands on the table!

942
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:27,146
How can you say I spread
false information about Katyn?

943
01:36:27,266 --> 01:36:31,504
You'll sign a statement that
Katyn is a German crime.

944
01:36:33,583 --> 01:36:34,863
No.

945
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:43,380
Who did you fight in the Rising?
Saved by a miracle,

946
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:46,459
you don't want to live
in your own country?

947
01:36:46,619 --> 01:36:50,338
- You're in your own country.
- You find life unbearable?

948
01:36:50,938 --> 01:36:56,056
Major, the Germans tried that
with me for 5 years,

949
01:36:57,095 --> 01:36:59,894
and you in 5 minutes?

950
01:37:00,374 --> 01:37:03,293
We have much more time
than the Germans.

951
01:37:03,413 --> 01:37:09,171
Maybe so.
Just tell me where I am.

952
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:10,931
In Poland?

953
01:37:11,371 --> 01:37:13,050
Take her away.

954
01:38:17,988 --> 01:38:20,107
Nika!

955
01:38:21,307 --> 01:38:25,585
- Father's coming.
- No. You're again imagining things.

956
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:32,343
Yes?

957
01:38:32,623 --> 01:38:34,902
- This is for you.
- Yes?

958
01:38:35,022 --> 01:38:39,460
We don't return mementos
from Katyn to the families now.

959
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:42,379
- When I learned that the major...
- What major?

960
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:46,058
The one who asked
to give it to you shot himself.

961
01:38:46,178 --> 01:38:49,257
He shot himself.
So I decided to bring it.

962
01:39:04,812 --> 01:39:08,930
Kozielsk, April 7, '40.

963
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:11,969
For two days they've
been deporting us.

964
01:39:12,129 --> 01:39:14,568
Where and why?
Nobody knows.

965
01:39:16,448 --> 01:39:19,407
After a search at 4:55 p.m.

966
01:39:19,567 --> 01:39:22,286
Our Polish time 2:55 p.m.

967
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,958
We left the walls and barbed wires
of the Kozielsk camp.

968
01:39:44,078 --> 01:39:48,197
We were put in prison carriages.
I'd never seen such carriages.

969
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:53,275
They say that 50% of passenger
cars in the USSR are prison ones.

970
01:40:12,828 --> 01:40:16,587
8:30 a.m. Departure from
Kozielsk westward.

971
01:40:17,187 --> 01:40:19,986
9:45 a.m. Jelnia Station.

972
01:40:20,546 --> 01:40:24,504
I'm along with a major,
a colonel, and a few captains.

973
01:40:24,784 --> 01:40:28,423
Twelve altogether
with room for seven at the most.

974
01:40:28,543 --> 01:40:31,502
Judging by the pieces
of paper we found,

975
01:40:31,782 --> 01:40:35,581
we get off outside Smolensk
about 10 km. We'll see.

976
01:40:40,899 --> 01:40:43,138
We must be going to Smolensk.

977
01:40:43,258 --> 01:40:46,857
Gniezdovo Station.

978
01:41:09,489 --> 01:41:11,288
Lieutenant Pilot,

979
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:15,527
1 st Air Squadron, Deblin.

980
01:41:18,486 --> 01:41:23,524
April 10, 1940.

981
01:41:33,481 --> 01:41:37,080
4:45 a.m. They wake us up
in the prison cars.

982
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,159
Now by trucks...

983
01:41:56,313 --> 01:41:59,912
Arrival at Gniezdovo, :
402 km away from Moscow.

984
01:42:01,031 --> 01:42:03,950
Two Black Marias and
a truck for things.

985
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,119
Take off your belt.

986
01:43:55,232 --> 01:43:56,872
Next.

987
01:44:18,464 --> 01:44:22,263
Family name, patronymic, rank.

988
01:44:22,423 --> 01:44:25,062
The general's documents.

989
01:44:26,222 --> 01:44:30,940
Born April 2, 1892.

990
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:32,859
It checks out.

991
01:44:35,059 --> 01:44:37,258
Take him away.

992
01:44:41,456 --> 01:44:43,736
Next.

993
01:46:50,452 --> 01:46:56,410
5:00 a.m. We leave
in a Black Maria.

994
01:46:56,730 --> 01:47:01,649
They brought us to a forest,
a kind of spa. A thorough search.

995
01:47:01,808 --> 01:47:04,408
They didn't find
my wedding ring.

996
01:47:04,727 --> 01:47:08,686
They took away my belt,
penknife, and watch.

997
01:47:08,806 --> 01:47:13,404
It showed 8:30 a.m.,
our Polish time 6:30 a.m.

998
01:47:14,764 --> 01:47:16,683
What will happen to us?

999
01:48:58,728 --> 01:49:01,088
Our Father
Thou art in heaven...

1000
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:43,833
Thy will be done on Earth
as well as in Heaven.

1001
01:50:05,905 --> 01:50:08,345
Give us this day our daily bread...

1002
01:50:37,735 --> 01:50:40,134
...Forgive us our trespasses...

1003
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:54,329
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us...
