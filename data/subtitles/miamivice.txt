1
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:40,579
Hey, darling.
Two Bacardi mojitos and a gin and tonic.

2
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:42,581
Lemon or lime?

3
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:45,050
Lime.

4
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,052
Where you from?

5
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:49,522
<i>Lisboa.</i> That's in Portugal.

6
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:53,515
But you got your tan in Miami?

7
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,767
What's your name?

8
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:05,760
- Rita.
- Rita. Sonny.

9
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:13,134
See you later, Rita.

10
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:56,222
Hey, Michael.

11
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:57,790
- Neptune.
- Here are your dates.

12
00:02:57,825 --> 00:03:00,626
Hey, baby.

13
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:04,563
Here you go.

14
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:07,766
- Let me hit you now.
- No, no, no. Please, put it away.

15
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:09,268
- Be cool.
- Come on.

16
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:13,261
Hit me later.

17
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,703
What's with number three?

18
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:28,776
She's sick, man.

19
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:32,625
That's cool. I'll go with two.

20
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,618
Let's go, sweetheart.

21
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:42,928
Do you know how much
I'm losing tonight?

22
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:44,630
No.

23
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:56,598
Where you going?

24
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,983
Easy. Easy.

25
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:21,400
Neptune should ease up
on the merchandise.

26
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:25,393
Flip the girls upstairs and we got him.

27
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:27,106
His day will come.

28
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:33,201
Hello?

29
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:39,207
Hello?

30
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:40,386
Hello?

31
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:44,379
- <i>Sonny?</i>
- Yeah. Who's this?

32
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,161
Sonny?

33
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:50,829
Alonzo?

34
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:53,766
Alonzo, I can't talk.
We're in the middle of a deal right now.

35
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,669
Take care of Leonetta for me.

36
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:59,705
Ask Ricardo to do that.

37
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,907
<i>I gave up nothing on you.</i>

38
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:05,900
They're on their own.
It's all their deal, anyway. Fuck them.

39
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:10,783
Alonzo, what are you talking about?

40
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:13,719
I'm falling by the house,

41
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:15,320
and then I'm gone.

42
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:18,057
So whatever you can do for her,
okay, Sonny?

43
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:21,994
Alonzo.

44
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:25,898
Goodbye.

45
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:28,167
- What is it?
- Alonzo Stevens.

46
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:29,902
Something's wrong.

47
00:06:29,937 --> 00:06:33,895
He told you to look after Leonetta for him.

48
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:40,245
FBI Miami.

49
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,238
This is Detective Crockett, Miami-Dade PD.
Patch me through to your SAC.

50
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,697
<i>Leonetta, it's Rico.</i>

51
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:02,690
<i>Give me a call back</i>
<i>as soon as you get a chance.</i>

52
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:18,517
This is ASAC John Fujima.

53
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:19,818
Detective Crockett.

54
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:22,054
What's your Miami-Dade badge number
and date of birth?

55
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,057
447-Charlie-1292.

56
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:28,093
- 447-Charlie-1292.
- <i>07-02-70.</i>

57
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:29,328
<i>Miami-Dade PD Tech.</i>

58
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:30,429
Bobby G., it's Rico.

59
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:34,399
Hey, that transponder we had
on Alonzo Stevens' Bentley, it still running?

60
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,068
<i>When's the last time we used it?</i>

61
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:40,061
I don't know.
We ain't worked him in six months.

62
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:41,774
Okay. So?

63
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,042
<i>One of your deals</i>
<i>may be going bad.</i>

64
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:47,179
Confidential informant
we cut loose to you guys.

65
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:50,282
CI's name is Alonzo Stevens. He called us.

66
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:52,551
We haven't spoken to him in six months.

67
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:54,953
How do I discuss this over
an open phone line?

68
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:56,955
How the hell do I know?

69
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,057
We got the phone call from Alonzo
on an open line.

70
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:03,050
That is the hand we have been dealt
at 11:47 on Saturday night.

71
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:07,232
Now, I do not know what case
you have him on, but whatever it is,

72
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:11,225
it is going bad, and it sounds like
it is going bad right now.

73
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:26,808
It's a preliminary meet and greet.

74
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:29,288
<i>Meet and greet?</i>

75
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:32,124
<i>You flash me yours, I'll flash you mine?</i>

76
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,258
<i>Who are you?</i>

77
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:35,194
- Ricardo Tubbs.
- My partner.

78
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,097
Yeah, deal goes down another time,
another place.

79
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:42,367
- So, what? No HRT weapons team out there?
- <i>That's right.</i>

80
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:43,535
Colombians? Russians?

81
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,504
White supremacists.

82
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:48,307
And that tape
is not gonna look good in court.

83
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:51,043
Aryan Brotherhood? Mongols?
Nazi Low Riders? What?

84
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:55,036
We think Aryan Brotherhood,
but we don't know for sure.

85
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:59,518
- What's up?
- Get Michael out of there.

86
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:03,511
- What about Neptune?
- It's Neptune's lucky night.

87
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,959
What else did Stevens tell you?

88
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:10,952
He said that it went bad,
that he didn't give us up. Told us goodbye.

89
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:18,971
<i>Rico, we got the Bentley.</i>

90
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:22,964
<i>Hey, he just got on the 95 southbound</i>
<i>from the 195 causeway.</i>

91
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:49,557
We got meth, ice, glass, Es, Ks, ex,

92
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:52,604
Mitsus, Ames, Colombian H.

93
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,275
Ice.

94
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,243
Party down with the coke.

95
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:00,679
You're looking at 92% pure.

96
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:04,182
Not like that jumped-on powder
they sell up in Nuyorico.

97
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:13,981
Never seen green?

98
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:29,130
You got the green. We got the goods.

99
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:30,909
We party.

100
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:34,902
Larry'll call you in the a.m.
about quantity and money, time and place.

101
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:44,189
Hey, Ivan!

102
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:48,182
My brother.

103
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:55,089
How long have you been working
with the FBI?

104
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:35,029
Alonzo, pull over!

105
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:40,134
Pull over!

106
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,388
Stay back!

107
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:52,391
What'd you do?

108
00:11:52,426 --> 00:11:56,294
I fronted their undercover team
to these guys like usual, you know?

109
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,097
They're Feds, Russian speakers.

110
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:01,233
I was the middleman.

111
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:05,226
- What, 15%?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, to set up the meet.

112
00:12:08,073 --> 00:12:12,066
They grabbed Leonetta.

113
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:18,672
They took Leonetta.

114
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:23,722
I gave them up, man.

115
00:12:23,757 --> 00:12:27,715
Gave up the Feds. Everything.

116
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:32,164
Everything I knew. Rico, I got to go home.

117
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:36,157
Got people there now.

118
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,373
- How did they get onto you, Alonzo?
- How the hell do I know?

119
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:45,366
They knew one Russian was FBI
from the get-go, so...

120
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:48,780
They knew I knew.

121
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:52,117
- Rico, I gotta go.
Alonzo. Alonzo.

122
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:58,757
- Rico, I got to go. I got to go.
- Alonzo. Alonzo!

123
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:02,750
- I gotta fucking go!
- Hello?

124
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:17,431
You don't...

125
00:13:19,144 --> 00:13:22,747
You don't...

126
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:26,740
You don't need to go home.

127
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:32,424
They said they wouldn't hurt her, man.

128
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:36,417
They lied.

129
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:57,638
- Alonzo!
- No!

130
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:08,126
Prints on the fridge.

131
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:12,119
Hold on.

132
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:17,469
Yeah.

133
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:19,371
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>What's your QTH?</i>

134
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:22,374
Just a couple blocks away.
We can see the lights.

135
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:23,542
Turn around.

136
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:27,145
Turn around? Look, we know these people.

137
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,138
Meet me in 15 minutes, Standard Park.

138
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:59,711
- What the hell just happened?
What was that?

139
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:01,179
Who's this?

140
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:04,482
He needs to talk to you.

141
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:07,519
I'm Fujima. We talked on the phone.

142
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:10,388
- So, this was your operation?
- Yes, at command level.

143
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:13,792
We trusted our informant, Alonzo, to you,
and you got his whole family killed?

144
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:15,961
What, did you jump some amateurs
into a game they ain't ready for?

145
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:18,330
- What the fuck happened, man?
- Three men got killed!

146
00:15:18,365 --> 00:15:22,323
And so did our...
- Cool down.

147
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,863
They discovered my guys were undercover,
and we don't know how.

148
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,703
This was an interagency task force,
DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs.

149
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:39,851
The leak could have come
from any one unit.

150
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:42,821
I gotta assume
my operational security is compromised.

151
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:46,814
Compromised? Your whole op sec is blown.
You're stone cold dead in the water.

152
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:52,019
Meanwhile, it does not track.

153
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,932
White supremacist gang?

154
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:57,502
White prison gangs is tweakers
and meth labs and trailer parks.

155
00:15:57,537 --> 00:16:00,472
Bouncing the old lady around
until they get busted back.

156
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:04,465
And how did they get all high tech
with sophisticated counterintel?

157
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:09,047
And what we here
talking to you for, anyway?

158
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:13,040
Miami-Dade wasn't part of the task force.

159
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:15,287
Oh.

160
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:16,921
They don't know you.

161
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,791
So, you want to recruit us?

162
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:22,260
Identify them. Who are they?

163
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:26,253
- How did they cut into us?
- How do we cut into them?

164
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:29,701
How do we get
all close and personal with them?

165
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:32,604
Make a buy. That worked well.

166
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,507
Sell to them? We supply them?

167
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,542
No, they got a steady stream of supply.

168
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:40,412
Colombian named José Yero,
midlevel trafficker.

169
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,882
Okay. So what about Yero?
Can we get to them through Yero?

170
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,317
Possible.
- What does he need?

171
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,352
- Money laundering? Transpo?
Transpo.

172
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:50,088
He outsources his transportation.

173
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:52,057
Okay.

174
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:56,050
Do we run an undercover on José Yero?

175
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:00,665
So we transport a load for Yero
into this group?

176
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,402
So can we run a load for Yero
into this group? It's a question.

177
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:06,504
He transships out of Haiti.

178
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,497
Flies his product in from Colombia,
hires someone to run it from Haiti into here.

179
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:18,038
This is a FLIR image of someone's
go-fast boats running in a Yero load.

180
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:23,822
AWAC shot it.

181
00:17:23,857 --> 00:17:27,815
That's all we got.

182
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:32,764
All right. If they do this,

183
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,757
I'd like them deputized as federal under
OCDETF for the purposes of this case.

184
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:38,603
Fine by me.

185
00:17:38,638 --> 00:17:40,438
Because your op sec is blown,

186
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:44,431
your agency can't know anything about
how they do whatever it is they do.

187
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:49,136
That's why I came alone. Thank you.

188
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:53,741
Sorry about your men.

189
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:04,051
What'd you spot?

190
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:08,389
Go-fast boats running that close?
On radar they look like one, not two.

191
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:11,803
Total darkness?

192
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:14,406
Man, those are skill sets.

193
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:17,776
Plus, who runs four 250 Mercs
off a deep-V hull?

194
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,110
Sal Maguda.

195
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:23,103
- He that good?
- Oh, yeah.

196
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:27,619
Bleaching it down.

197
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:31,612
Must have just unloaded.

198
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:44,158
- Who are we?
- How's your Creole?

199
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:12,697
Do you know whose load this is?

200
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:16,690
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

201
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:05,817
Hello?

202
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:08,853
Hey, Nicholas, my ace. What's up?

203
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:10,522
Everything's good. You?

204
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:12,290
<i>We good. We all good.</i>

205
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:16,283
As a matter of fact, we're looking
to charge up your cash flow. Hold on.

206
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,133
- <i>Nicholas, how you doing?</i>
- Sonny. What's up?

207
00:20:22,168 --> 00:20:24,936
Somebody's something's got to go
somewhere, some when.

208
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:26,871
Not too distant in the future.

209
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:30,864
Except he had transpo problems.

210
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:33,177
Call Colombia.

211
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:37,170
- Man, that's José Yero.
Really?

212
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:41,642
He is AUC, you know.
Colombian right-wing paramilitaries.

213
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:45,979
You know who they are?
They are vertically integrated. They are...

214
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:49,661
You mean, they walk around
with constant erections?

215
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:52,864
No. They farm, process, produce, export...

216
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:54,632
I know what it means.

217
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:57,035
No, see, it gives them attitude.

218
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,971
A player negotiates too hard
and you never hear from him again,

219
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:03,608
'cause these guys kill everything!

220
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:04,976
I gotta know what's the skinny.

221
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:07,345
- It's none of your fucking business.
- It can come back on me, baby.

222
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,913
It can't come back on you, baby.

223
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:11,783
- Am I assured of that?
- Hey, sunshine.

224
00:21:11,818 --> 00:21:15,253
When has Rico or Sonny
ever lied to you, huh?

225
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:18,856
I mean, when has anything Rico told you
not happened exactly like he said?

226
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:21,025
You saying I lie to you?
No, I'm not saying that...

227
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,093
Yes, you are.

228
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:23,861
It's just there's variables,
you know?

229
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,663
Randomness, see? That's why.

230
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:27,799
- "That's why," what?
- Well, why, like, if you can't deliver,

231
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:31,035
this group goes from zero
to high-order violence like that.

232
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,939
You made a 15% commission
off three money-laundering prosecutions

233
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,741
I put you into,

234
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:39,577
you know, which is why you live
in your $4 million condo.

235
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:41,245
And you question Rico and Sonny?

236
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,238
Fuck that. I will cap your skanky ass
and throw it off that goddamn balcony.

237
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:48,820
Yeah, then we can kick back and
watch Marlins highlights on this 65" plasma.

238
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:51,623
After we clean this place up.
Don't you ever put anything away?

239
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:55,059
Plus he's gonna commission José Yero
for putting you to José Yero.

240
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:58,396
Anybody looking at his ill-gotten gains?
IRS looking into his shit?

241
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:01,165
Any reason
this does not go down?

242
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,103
That's the sound of air rapidly filling
the vacuum created by your departed body.

243
00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:09,096
On account of how fast I remanded your ass
back into custody.

244
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:11,776
Why is this happening to me?

245
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:13,878
Because you lead a life of crime.

246
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:16,614
Can't do time, don't mess with crime.

247
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:20,607
He's cool. He'll make the call.

248
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:12,804
Hey, you.

249
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,839
Wake up.

250
00:23:14,874 --> 00:23:17,875
What happened to you?
Aren't you excited to see me?

251
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,277
I can't talk about it.

252
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:23,270
- Mmm-hmm.
- This is all right.

253
00:23:56,414 --> 00:24:00,407
I'm just joking.

254
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:29,369
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep right here. That's it.

255
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:48,755
- Any word?
Nothing.

256
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,942
"Hey, Trudy." Hey, Sonny.

257
00:24:57,977 --> 00:24:59,577
Hey, Trudy. How you doing, darling?

258
00:24:59,612 --> 00:25:01,212
Who are we here?

259
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:05,205
It's the same fabricated fundamentals
as before.

260
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,186
Rico.

261
00:25:08,221 --> 00:25:12,190
3-to-5 on assault, Folsom B-wing,
Pelican Bay.

262
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:15,860
Sonny, Marine Corps,
Chicago, and 10 plus weapons.

263
00:25:15,895 --> 00:25:19,853
Five out of eight, and jumped parole.
Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.

264
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:22,533
And then it goes cold,

265
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:26,170
'cause presumably you're both too smart
and too fast to get jacked again.

266
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:28,372
What about this place?

267
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:31,475
It'll show up
leased under these aliases.

268
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,877
How'd they test?

269
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:36,080
- And who tested them?
- Helene in NYPD.

270
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:38,216
And she worked through
your false identities,

271
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:42,209
and then she found your deeper, hidden,
more criminal selves.

272
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:37,702
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- He's in.

273
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:41,572
You're on. The meet's in Haiti.

274
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:44,408
<i>He'll negotiate the price</i>
<i>in person.</i>

275
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:46,444
<i>Call me after you've landed</i>
<i>in Port-au-Prince,</i>

276
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:50,437
'cause only when you're on the ground
will he tell me where you are to go.

277
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:04,651
Be careful. Be cool.

278
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:23,514
Approaching. Turning to heading 340
down to 6,000 feet.

279
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:27,507
Clear to the ILS runway 1-0
for the approach to Port-au-Prince.

280
00:29:03,054 --> 00:29:07,047
Why do I get the feeling everybody knows
we're here 15 blocks out?

281
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:11,217
'Cause everybody knows
we're here 15 blocks out.

282
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,486
Sit.

283
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:09,553
José.

284
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:13,357
Sonny Burnett.
That's my partner, Ricardo.

285
00:30:13,392 --> 00:30:15,326
Thank you for coming down.

286
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:16,727
So, let's lay it out.

287
00:30:16,762 --> 00:30:18,829
Nicholas say you run a tight group.

288
00:30:18,864 --> 00:30:21,332
That's nice, 'cause we got product
that's got to move.

289
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,868
- Real tight. We move as fast as FedEx.
- Move to where?

290
00:30:23,903 --> 00:30:26,103
To New York, through South Florida.

291
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:28,639
Move when?
- Right now.

292
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:30,474
That's kind of all of an instant.

293
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,543
That means only one thing, real fast.

294
00:30:32,578 --> 00:30:35,913
So, the price, is it right?

295
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,715
Price is right.

296
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,708
But how I know if you any good at this shit?

297
00:30:45,623 --> 00:30:46,924
What's that?

298
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:50,628
Yeah, your business.
How much volume you do?

299
00:30:50,663 --> 00:30:52,830
Whose product you move?
Who you work with?

300
00:30:52,865 --> 00:30:56,823
Other than Nicholas,
who the fuck knows you?

301
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,863
Well, my mommy and daddy know me.

302
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,910
And we don't talk about who we work with.

303
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:07,845
And we didn't come down here
to audition for business.

304
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,838
Business auditions for us.

305
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:16,820
And knows all about us,
before they call Nicholas.

306
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:20,813
That way we don't waste avgas
or our motherfucking time.

307
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:35,239
You want us to be telling you
about our shit?

308
00:31:35,274 --> 00:31:37,408
You can't find out on your own?

309
00:31:37,443 --> 00:31:38,909
Why do I not buy that?

310
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:40,911
You with DEA? The Feeb? What's up?

311
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:44,181
They targeting our transpo line?
You with the Man?

312
00:31:44,216 --> 00:31:48,174
You wearing a wire?

313
00:31:53,757 --> 00:31:55,826
I'm gonna tell you
what's gonna happen.

314
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:57,795
People gonna come in here,
and you know what they gonna say?

315
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,996
They're gonna look around
and they're gonna go...

316
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:02,833
"That's some crazy
motherfucking wallpaper. What is that?

317
00:32:02,868 --> 00:32:06,826
"Jackson Pollock?"

318
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:11,965
"No, <i>viejo.</i> That was José Yero,
who got splattered all over his own wall."

319
00:32:13,277 --> 00:32:17,270
So, we can close each other's eyes
right now, real fast.

320
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:24,510
But then ain't nobody
gonna make no money.

321
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:29,927
José.

322
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:49,513
So let's talk equipment.

323
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:52,916
Adam A500s, carbon composite,
real stealthy.

324
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:55,586
1,400 nautical-mile range, low and slow.

325
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:58,622
We like Caravelles and 727s
to move the product from source countries

326
00:32:58,657 --> 00:33:00,357
to transshipment places like here.

327
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:02,493
Big loads, we like containers.

328
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:05,996
Smaller loads into South Florida,
we do go-fast boats.

329
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:07,464
So, what's the weight?

330
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:09,433
- First, let's talk logistics.
- Okay.

331
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:13,426
You pick up a load, you fly it in the hole,
we tell you the drop point,

332
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,072
and our people then move it on up the road.

333
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:19,065
Now, not so fast. People at the drop point
are our people, not yours.

334
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,503
You know, so there's no tweakers, dopers,
first-timers, people we don't know.

335
00:33:24,748 --> 00:33:26,984
They didn't do time with us,
they ain't doing crime with us.

336
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:29,553
Once we pick up the load,
the next time you hear from us

337
00:33:29,588 --> 00:33:31,388
it'll be a date, time, and a place.

338
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:34,992
Like, "There's a 18-wheeler in a parking lot
in north Miami with the keys in the ignition."

339
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:38,985
You pick it up, you drive away.
Smooth, that's how we do it.

340
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:45,291
So, when you looking to move it?

341
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:47,571
Never.

342
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:51,108
'Cause how you drop loads, I don't like,
so maybe this don't work.

343
00:33:51,143 --> 00:33:53,510
Then it don't work.

344
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:56,814
Red light, green light, José.

345
00:33:56,849 --> 00:34:00,484
They also call me <i>Cochi Loco.</i>

346
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:02,986
That means "crazy pig."

347
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:06,123
'Cause I run security and counterintel.

348
00:34:06,158 --> 00:34:10,116
I get people to tell me
what they don't ever want to say.

349
00:34:10,828 --> 00:34:13,931
And I have eyes everywhere.

350
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:17,924
That part of what I do,
you never want to find out about.

351
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:23,807
Other people negotiate money,
and go and no go.

352
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:27,800
Yes, no, maybe so.

353
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:30,848
Not me.

354
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:33,016
So, what the hell are we talking to you for?

355
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:36,553
- I had to lay my eyes on you.
Why is that?

356
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:40,546
To see if you go meet the Man.

357
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,353
And?

358
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:51,791
You seem okay.

359
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,971
But him,

360
00:34:54,006 --> 00:34:57,964
I don't like how he looks.

361
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:03,102
Do you want to fuck my partner,
or do you want to do business with us?

362
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:07,840
'Cause I don't give a shit
how you think he looks.

363
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:12,189
Wait by the phone in the hotel.

364
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:16,182
You get a call, or maybe you don't.

365
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:20,486
And then you can piss off
back to where you come from.

366
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:18,522
Yero said New York
through South Florida.

367
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:21,725
Then this load
does not go to the Miami group.

368
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,718
That may take load number two.

369
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:44,070
That was fast.

370
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,963
Four hours. They're dicking us around.
Call it.

371
00:37:12,676 --> 00:37:14,044
That's it.

372
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,037
Let's go.

373
00:37:56,987 --> 00:38:00,980
Put your guns on the table.

374
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,563
We didn't bring you here to kill you.

375
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:10,556
If we want you dead, you'd have been
no longer drawing breath in Miami.

376
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,876
$3,000 a kilo on small loads.

377
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:21,311
Thought we had
to meet the Man.

378
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:22,813
You do.

379
00:38:22,848 --> 00:38:26,806
- When is that?
- Right now.

380
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:49,061
Full signal, no service.
They're jamming the phones.

381
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:55,167
This is the type of stuff the CIA does.
In Baghdad.

382
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:59,205
Yeah. What's it doing on a dope deal?

383
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:28,668
Out of the car.

384
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:53,426
See the three trucks?
Move there now.

385
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:13,179
Where'd all the people go?

386
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:35,367
Ready, boss?

387
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:44,888
Excuse me, because I am very busy.

388
00:40:44,923 --> 00:40:48,892
I have many things to do,
so this will be brief. Yes?

389
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:52,885
I will try you out on one load to build trust.

390
00:40:54,865 --> 00:40:58,858
1,000 ki's out of Colombia.
Your end is $3 million.

391
00:40:59,903 --> 00:41:03,106
In all matters, when you work for me,

392
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:07,099
you must do
exactly what you say you will do.

393
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:11,437
In this business with me,
I do not buy a service. I buy a result.

394
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:14,518
If you say you will do a thing,

395
00:41:14,553 --> 00:41:18,511
you must do exactly that thing.

396
00:41:19,122 --> 00:41:23,115
Then you will prosper beyond your dreams
and live in Miami millionaire-style.

397
00:41:25,562 --> 00:41:28,031
You will contact and work
through José Yero

398
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:31,268
on logistics, communications, security.

399
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:35,261
To do with money and terms,
you will work through my Isabella.

400
00:41:36,106 --> 00:41:40,099
I look forward
to our doing more work together.

401
00:41:40,844 --> 00:41:44,837
Whether we do or do not,
it is unlikely that we will meet again.

402
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:50,776
I extend my best wishes to your families.

403
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:59,285
Thank you for making this trip to see me.

404
00:43:31,421 --> 00:43:35,425
<i>Flight 000 is airborne.</i>

405
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,418
<i>This is November 1206 Sierra.</i>
<i>Roger that.</i>

406
00:44:01,484 --> 00:44:05,477
Good afternoon.
Radar contact. Climb and maintain 7,000.

407
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:10,427
November 636
is coming your way from the northwest.

408
00:44:10,462 --> 00:44:14,420
636.

409
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:27,510
Opa-locka Departure,
good afternoon.

410
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:31,181
Radar contact. Climb and maintain 7,000.

411
00:44:31,216 --> 00:44:34,184
King Air 1206 Sierra,

412
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:38,177
<i>you see anything off your right side?</i>

413
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:46,051
<i>This is November 1206 Sierra.</i>
<i>Negative, Opa-locka.</i>

414
00:44:48,031 --> 00:44:52,024
I got a double hit.
I think there's another plane there.

415
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,017
Let me see.

416
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:09,753
Go down to 220.

417
00:45:09,788 --> 00:45:13,746
Ghost. One blip, one plane.

418
00:45:38,216 --> 00:45:39,282
Yeah.

419
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:43,275
<i>Oye,</i> Burnett. Our client got delivery.
Product's on the road. Good work.

420
00:45:43,553 --> 00:45:46,756
Yeah, but we had a problem
before your client showed up.

421
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:50,749
<i>Somebody tried</i>
<i>to rip off the load.</i>

422
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:57,500
<i>You know a detail shop</i>
<i>on Second and Overtown?</i>

423
00:45:57,535 --> 00:45:58,601
I do.

424
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:02,594
<i>Across the street we found a stash house.</i>
<i>10:00 a.m. Be there.</i>

425
00:46:09,112 --> 00:46:13,105
Here we go.

426
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:20,212
Only two.

427
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:39,331
They tried to jack your load.
We brought him home and discovered this.

428
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:44,347
Haitians stole this two weeks ago.

429
00:46:44,382 --> 00:46:46,549
That's my load. This is my product.

430
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:50,542
How'd they know where the drop was?

431
00:46:51,688 --> 00:46:55,681
- How'd they know?
- I find out.

432
00:46:58,328 --> 00:47:02,321
See you later.

433
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:12,764
I see you,
I see a load we lost two weeks ago

434
00:47:14,177 --> 00:47:15,778
all in the same place.

435
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:19,771
Well, you don't like us finding your load,
we can go ahead and lose it all over again.

436
00:47:20,283 --> 00:47:24,276
What other suspicions
did you mastermind today?

437
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:40,470
We want our product back.

438
00:47:40,505 --> 00:47:41,671
Sure.

439
00:47:41,706 --> 00:47:43,473
How much?

440
00:47:43,508 --> 00:47:47,477
How much...

441
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:51,470
- For what?
- For recovering that.

442
00:47:52,515 --> 00:47:54,918
Nothing.

443
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:56,853
Nothing?

444
00:47:56,888 --> 00:48:00,846
Consider it an investment

445
00:48:01,391 --> 00:48:05,384
in the future of a fine business relationship.

446
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:09,755
That is because it's yours.
What's yours is yours.

447
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:19,809
So is this a one-time deal?

448
00:48:19,844 --> 00:48:23,802
Or is something else coming up?

449
00:48:32,322 --> 00:48:36,315
Give them the shipment on the 17th.

450
00:48:40,396 --> 00:48:44,389
Conveyance?
- By ocean. Out of Barranquilla.

451
00:48:47,837 --> 00:48:51,830
José has details.

452
00:49:04,988 --> 00:49:06,456
Lay it out.

453
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:10,393
You're gonna get the longs and lats
for a transshipment point.

454
00:49:10,428 --> 00:49:13,263
Ma'am.

455
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:15,331
- Do me one favor.
- Yeah?

456
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:17,900
In return for the risks we took
in recovering your load,

457
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:21,893
allow me to buy you a drink.

458
00:49:27,844 --> 00:49:30,647
How fast does that go?

459
00:49:30,682 --> 00:49:34,640
Goes very fast.

460
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:37,020
Show me.

461
00:49:37,055 --> 00:49:40,523
Where would you like to go?

462
00:49:40,558 --> 00:49:44,394
What do you like to drink?

463
00:49:44,429 --> 00:49:48,387
I'm a fiend for mojitos.

464
00:49:48,498 --> 00:49:52,491
I know a place.

465
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:56,895
Partner.

466
00:49:58,274 --> 00:50:02,267
I know what I'm doing.

467
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:10,553
All right. The secured satellite comms,

468
00:50:10,588 --> 00:50:13,022
longs and lats for the transshipment points,
that's all cool.

469
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:14,991
But I need a vector, not a location.

470
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:16,859
Ships move, that's why they call them ships.

471
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:19,629
Ship stops, it's trying to impersonate
an apartment building.

472
00:50:19,664 --> 00:50:23,299
At sea, that is very suspicious.
Brings about attention.

473
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:27,292
AWACS, Coast Guard, U.S. Customs,
that's all bad.

474
00:50:43,586 --> 00:50:47,023
I take you to the best place for mojitos.

475
00:50:47,058 --> 00:50:49,392
Where is that?

476
00:50:49,427 --> 00:50:51,461
Bodeguita del Medio.

477
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:55,398
Oh, the Keys?

478
00:50:55,433 --> 00:50:57,834
Havana.

479
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:00,903
Havana?

480
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:04,040
Cubans don't like my business.

481
00:51:04,075 --> 00:51:08,033
- And they don't like my passport.
- It's okay, the harbormaster is my cousin.

482
00:51:26,062 --> 00:51:30,055
Grab the wheel.

483
00:51:40,076 --> 00:51:44,069
You do business in Cuba
with your husband?

484
00:51:44,414 --> 00:51:47,150
I never do business in Cuba.

485
00:51:47,185 --> 00:51:51,143
And Jesús is not my husband.

486
00:51:55,525 --> 00:51:59,518
I'm a businesswoman.

487
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:03,722
I do not need a husband
to have a house to live in.

488
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:21,533
- You like the mojito?
- Mojito's great.

489
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,150
Do you dance?

490
00:53:28,185 --> 00:53:32,143
I dance.

491
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:32,768
You will like it.

492
00:56:32,803 --> 00:56:35,271
Allman Brothers.
You know Allman Brothers?

493
00:56:35,306 --> 00:56:36,472
No.

494
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:39,008
Lynyrd Skynyrd? <i>Free Bird?</i>

495
00:56:39,043 --> 00:56:42,445
- No Skynyrd.
- Well, that was the music back then.

496
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,081
And he played all those Atlanta bars.

497
00:56:45,116 --> 00:56:49,074
But his luck was...

498
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:53,745
Well, my dad never got lucky,
so he started trucking.

499
00:56:54,757 --> 00:56:58,750
Yeah, I didn't see a whole lot of him.
But we were close.

500
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,791
- You look like your mother?
- Why?

501
00:57:08,738 --> 00:57:12,274
She died in Angola when I was 16.

502
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:15,878
She was a translator.

503
00:57:15,913 --> 00:57:19,871
I show you photograph. It's from wedding.

504
00:57:32,194 --> 00:57:36,187
This is a bad idea.

505
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,968
This is past a bad idea.

506
00:57:39,003 --> 00:57:41,437
And it has no future.

507
00:57:41,472 --> 00:57:44,874
That's right.

508
00:57:44,909 --> 00:57:48,444
So, then there's nothing to worry about.

509
00:57:48,479 --> 00:57:52,437
Come here.

510
00:58:47,102 --> 00:58:51,095
See?

511
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:56,579
Lucinda somebody's wedding.

512
00:58:56,614 --> 00:58:59,849
Everybody is with couples.

513
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:03,842
Husbands and wives, they all pose.

514
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:08,413
But she is the most special.

515
01:00:13,389 --> 01:00:17,382
Let's talk a different kind of deal.

516
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:28,092
You pay us zero.

517
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:31,206
Is it December?

518
01:00:31,241 --> 01:00:32,708
Why?

519
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:35,444
Did Christmas come early this year?

520
01:00:35,479 --> 01:00:37,680
No.

521
01:00:37,715 --> 01:00:41,383
We become partners on the loads we run.

522
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:45,376
What we want is 25% of that load in product.

523
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:49,625
And why, you're thinking,

524
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:53,228
would I be crazy enough
to cut in these <i>gringos</i> like that?

525
01:00:53,263 --> 01:00:57,221
It's because Sonny and Ricardo
can deliver to me what no one else can.

526
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:01,337
We guarantee loads.

527
01:01:01,372 --> 01:01:05,330
Comes up short, we make good.

528
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:09,534
Your operation will run
from now on out risk-free.

529
01:01:13,115 --> 01:01:17,086
And you are the 25% partner?

530
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:19,521
You?

531
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:23,514
What if I tell you
your ideas are too big for your skin?

532
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:28,653
And merely to propose this
is a dangerous thing.

533
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,169
Then I would say to you, this has been fun.

534
01:01:34,204 --> 01:01:38,162
Okay. So?

535
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:44,546
Think of the cash you don't have to front.

536
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:48,539
Cash is not difficult.

537
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:58,383
Seventeen.

538
01:02:00,062 --> 01:02:03,799
I would say you're five percentage points
away from a deal.

539
01:02:03,834 --> 01:02:07,792
Maybe I'm only one.

540
01:02:09,471 --> 01:02:13,464
You've convinced me.

541
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:27,412
- <i>What's up? Where are you?</i>
- I'm on my way back.

542
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:51,713
The meeting with Castillo
is in 45 minutes.

543
01:02:51,748 --> 01:02:54,383
- What's up, Sonny. You okay?
- Fine, darling.

544
01:02:54,418 --> 01:02:55,551
So, where you been?

545
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:57,653
Hit a couple of jazz clubs,
fell back to her place.

546
01:02:57,688 --> 01:02:59,121
- Where?
- Vedado.

547
01:02:59,156 --> 01:03:01,323
- Where's Vedado?
- Suburbs outside Havana.

548
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:04,226
- You went to Havana, Cuba?
- No, Havana, Louisiana.

549
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:05,461
Don't we have a meet?

550
01:03:05,496 --> 01:03:06,862
You making moves on Montoya's woman?

551
01:03:06,897 --> 01:03:08,697
- No.
- You're not making moves on her?

552
01:03:08,732 --> 01:03:12,690
- We're making moves on each other.
- Oh, so that's supposed to make it all right?

553
01:03:13,102 --> 01:03:17,095
Something like that.

554
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:22,133
- So what happened to the first load?
- Went to Dominicans in New York.

555
01:03:22,344 --> 01:03:26,337
We think load number two's going
to our guys. South Florida. Their big buyer.

556
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:30,853
- Okay, that's great.
- Yeah.

557
01:03:30,888 --> 01:03:34,490
But we wanna go beyond load number two.

558
01:03:34,525 --> 01:03:38,427
- Why are we going exploring?
- Who's the "we"?

559
01:03:38,462 --> 01:03:41,330
Only thing you've contributed so far to this
is bad intel.

560
01:03:41,365 --> 01:03:45,323
- How's that?
- José Yero, cocaine producer?

561
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:49,338
Yero's middle management,
part of a bigger transnational operation

562
01:03:49,373 --> 01:03:51,773
run by Arcángel de Jesús Montoya.

563
01:03:51,808 --> 01:03:54,843
Montoya's the new news. Globalized.

564
01:03:54,878 --> 01:03:56,145
Moving?

565
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,614
Colombian coke and H,
arms from the Ukraine,

566
01:03:58,649 --> 01:04:01,483
E from Holland,
pirated software from China into Brazil.

567
01:04:01,518 --> 01:04:04,887
What's this got to do
with the price of tea in China?

568
01:04:04,922 --> 01:04:07,189
We're seeing their ops.

569
01:04:07,224 --> 01:04:10,526
Transpo.
You know, money-laundering networks.

570
01:04:10,561 --> 01:04:13,729
It would take years
to put together a deal like this.

571
01:04:13,764 --> 01:04:17,722
We want to stay under,
run in load number two and keep going,

572
01:04:19,268 --> 01:04:23,261
and hold off busting the ABs or Yero.

573
01:04:23,305 --> 01:04:26,742
We illuminate Montoya's operations
from the inside.

574
01:04:26,777 --> 01:04:29,511
No one has ever tread before
where we are now.

575
01:04:29,546 --> 01:04:32,548
Well, the answer's no.

576
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:36,351
We take the Aryan Brothers, the shooters,
pressure them for the leak.

577
01:04:36,386 --> 01:04:37,486
It's a bird in the hand.

578
01:04:37,521 --> 01:04:41,479
I'm not changing my op plan
for speculation masquerading as intel.

579
01:04:42,157 --> 01:04:44,526
Look, I know undercover
requires aggression,

580
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:47,896
some outlaw attitude. You know,
how else do you lie down with dogs?

581
01:04:47,931 --> 01:04:49,364
- Okay, but that...
- Go fuck yourself.

582
01:04:49,399 --> 01:04:53,357
Chill. Sonny, chill.

583
01:04:54,203 --> 01:04:56,338
You know what this prick's game is?

584
01:04:56,373 --> 01:04:59,341
He'll get his picture in the <i>Miami Herald</i>
off a quick bust,

585
01:04:59,376 --> 01:05:02,211
save his punk-ass career
at the slug farm in DC.

586
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:06,204
- We are not backing off this.
That's it.

587
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:11,186
Where you on this?

588
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:15,179
100% with Sonny.

589
01:05:15,857 --> 01:05:19,850
Change the mission statement.

590
01:05:21,997 --> 01:05:24,199
I have to run it past my ADO in DC.

591
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:27,903
Hey, slick. Don't try and shine me on.

592
01:05:27,938 --> 01:05:31,373
You don't have the time or the skill.

593
01:05:31,408 --> 01:05:34,910
If I close this down,

594
01:05:34,945 --> 01:05:38,380
I will close it down right now.

595
01:05:38,415 --> 01:05:42,373
And you can sink in Washington.

596
01:05:44,386 --> 01:05:48,379
All right, do it.

597
01:05:48,757 --> 01:05:52,750
You fucking better be right.

598
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:02,404
- So, what's going on?
- As in?

599
01:06:02,439 --> 01:06:06,397
As in, there's undercover
and then there is, "Which way is up?"

600
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:11,502
Oh, you think I'm in so deep, I forgot?

601
01:06:14,716 --> 01:06:18,709
I will never doubt you.

602
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:18,613
Did you find it?
Yeah.

603
01:07:18,648 --> 01:07:21,817
Dominion or Blackstone hedge funds?

604
01:07:21,852 --> 01:07:24,920
Through Hong Kong bank?
Yes.

605
01:07:24,955 --> 01:07:27,322
Ukrainian shipment?

606
01:07:27,357 --> 01:07:31,315
Eight tons, small arms and RPGs

607
01:07:31,993 --> 01:07:34,763
on the 27th.

608
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:38,567
Tell me about the deal in South Florida.

609
01:07:38,602 --> 01:07:42,560
They want 18% of the product
to bring in loads. They guarantee them.

610
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:46,508
Our risk goes to zero.

611
01:07:46,543 --> 01:07:49,511
And Burnett?

612
01:07:49,546 --> 01:07:53,504
What does your intuition tell you?

613
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:58,943
My intuition about Burnett?

614
01:08:02,424 --> 01:08:06,417
I slept with him in Havana.

615
01:08:10,899 --> 01:08:14,503
And?

616
01:08:14,538 --> 01:08:16,705
A serious man.

617
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:20,698
Ambitious, but he has to be watched.

618
01:08:20,909 --> 01:08:24,902
After a few good runs,
he will renegotiate the deal upwards.

619
01:08:25,781 --> 01:08:29,484
That's my girl.

620
01:08:29,519 --> 01:08:33,188
But José Yero thinks you are wrong.

621
01:08:33,223 --> 01:08:37,181
On the next load, he wants
to front them silver, but pay them in lead.

622
01:08:44,032 --> 01:08:48,025
What do you wanna do?

623
01:08:49,871 --> 01:08:52,507
I like the diminished risk.

624
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:56,500
I like businessmen who are competent
because you can predict their behavior.

625
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:05,543
On the other hand, if what you wish
is <i>el plomo,</i> the lead, then do that.

626
01:09:07,122 --> 01:09:11,115
After the load is received,
we will close their eyes forever.

627
01:09:20,836 --> 01:09:24,840
We will try a few runs with these partners.

628
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:28,833
I will tell José.

629
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:21,923
<i>Hola, chica.</i>

630
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:25,894
<i>Hola, chico.</i>

631
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,603
Hey, what's up? This is Trudy, my girl.

632
01:11:34,638 --> 01:11:37,138
- It's a pleasure.
- Hey, nice club.

633
01:11:37,173 --> 01:11:38,306
I redid it.

634
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:42,299
And I got places in Medellín,
Foz do Iguaçu, and Rio.

635
01:11:43,712 --> 01:11:47,705
- You like clubs?
- Oh, yeah. I'm a disco guy.

636
01:11:52,122 --> 01:11:56,080
In the back.

637
01:12:08,603 --> 01:12:12,596
In Colón, in Panama, a Malaysian freighter
will transfer eight tons.

638
01:12:14,109 --> 01:12:17,145
Crates with Russian marking.

639
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,314
Do not open them.

640
01:12:19,349 --> 01:12:23,307
The 4,000 ki's you move into Miami,
you keep and release when we say.

641
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:29,013
So long as delivery goes down our way.

642
01:12:29,824 --> 01:12:31,326
Sure.

643
01:12:31,361 --> 01:12:35,230
But the crates,
they come back to Barranquilla.

644
01:12:35,265 --> 01:12:37,866
You want us to break down the load
for different buyers?

645
01:12:37,901 --> 01:12:41,859
No. It's one, my main South Florida guy.

646
01:12:42,971 --> 01:12:45,674
José, my ace.

647
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:47,909
Skies are crowded, man.

648
01:12:47,944 --> 01:12:51,913
AWAC's, ICE, DEA spies in the sky.

649
01:12:51,948 --> 01:12:55,906
Do you have any counterintel you could
contribute to the good and the welfare?

650
01:12:56,184 --> 01:12:58,653
Sure.

651
01:12:58,688 --> 01:13:02,646
Check your e-mail.

652
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:44,165
Hello?

653
01:13:47,237 --> 01:13:49,471
It's José.

654
01:13:49,506 --> 01:13:52,874
- José, what is it?
- <i>I don't like the Americans.</i>

655
01:13:52,909 --> 01:13:56,177
- Why?
- Too good at what they do.

656
01:13:56,212 --> 01:13:58,446
<i>So?</i>

657
01:13:58,481 --> 01:14:00,081
They are wrong.

658
01:14:00,116 --> 01:14:04,018
Somehow, somehow they are wrong.

659
01:14:04,053 --> 01:14:07,021
You ran them. Did you run them?

660
01:14:07,056 --> 01:14:11,025
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Do they check out?

661
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:12,527
Yes.

662
01:14:12,562 --> 01:14:14,729
<i>We made their deal.</i>

663
01:14:14,764 --> 01:14:18,722
And Isabella disagrees with you.

664
01:15:42,183 --> 01:15:44,886
Once I had a fortune.

665
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:48,879
It said, "Live now.
Life is short. Time is luck."

666
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:56,898
You got assets somewhere?

667
01:15:56,933 --> 01:15:58,933
Insurance?

668
01:15:58,968 --> 01:16:02,926
Why?

669
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:06,574
Things go wrong.

670
01:16:06,609 --> 01:16:10,567
The odds catch up.

671
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:17,441
Probability is like gravity.

672
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,513
You cannot negotiate with gravity.

673
01:16:25,093 --> 01:16:29,086
One day...

674
01:16:29,163 --> 01:16:33,167
One day you should just cash out,
you know.

675
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:35,336
Just cash out and get out.

676
01:16:35,371 --> 01:16:39,040
- Yeah?
- Yeah. As far and as fast as you can.

677
01:16:39,075 --> 01:16:40,608
Would you find me?

678
01:16:40,643 --> 01:16:43,912
Yes, I would.

679
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:47,916
This is very Cuban.
The protective male talking.

680
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:51,052
It's the talk of a man.

681
01:16:51,087 --> 01:16:53,588
If he were your husband,

682
01:16:53,623 --> 01:16:57,325
he would never put you at risk.

683
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,962
And he would never put you within
1,000 miles of anything

684
01:17:00,997 --> 01:17:03,898
that could hurt you.

685
01:17:03,933 --> 01:17:07,891
And where would you be?

686
01:17:08,269 --> 01:17:12,262
A while longer still in this business,
and then I'd find you.

687
01:17:12,941 --> 01:17:16,044
- Would you?
- Yes, ma'am.

688
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,037
If you couldn't,
I would have left the only thing I know

689
01:17:20,315 --> 01:17:24,308
since I was 17.

690
01:17:37,298 --> 01:17:40,735
But none of this will happen.

691
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:44,038
Because what do you see around?

692
01:17:44,073 --> 01:17:47,041
Look around you.

693
01:17:47,076 --> 01:17:51,034
It's controlled
by Arcángel de Jesús Montoya.

694
01:18:14,302 --> 01:18:16,704
Let me talk to Fujima.

695
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:19,407
- <i>Who's this?</i>
- Ricardo.

696
01:18:19,442 --> 01:18:21,976
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

697
01:18:22,011 --> 01:18:24,512
Listen, I want you to issue an alert.

698
01:18:24,547 --> 01:18:26,748
<i>An informant has revealed</i>
<i>that a freighter</i>

699
01:18:26,783 --> 01:18:28,449
departed Barranquilla

700
01:18:28,484 --> 01:18:32,253
for South Florida with plans
to transship contraband to go-fast boats

701
01:18:32,288 --> 01:18:35,323
<i>in broad daylight</i>
<i>one day next week off the coast of Miami.</i>

702
01:18:35,358 --> 01:18:37,158
Okay.

703
01:18:37,193 --> 01:18:39,227
For Customs, you say Monday.

704
01:18:39,262 --> 01:18:42,397
For FBI operations in DC, you say Tuesday.

705
01:18:42,432 --> 01:18:46,167
FBI Miami, you say Wednesday,
DEA on Thursday,

706
01:18:46,202 --> 01:18:50,160
Coast Guard on Friday.
And keep it classified, keep it discreet,

707
01:18:50,471 --> 01:18:54,464
keep it out of interagency communications.

708
01:20:48,389 --> 01:20:49,790
Yero hit me back.

709
01:20:49,825 --> 01:20:53,783
He says U.S. assets expects
our transshipment load on Tuesday day.

710
01:20:54,362 --> 01:20:58,355
Tuesday day only went out
to FBI Operations planted in DC.

711
01:21:00,735 --> 01:21:02,403
So what's up?

712
01:21:02,438 --> 01:21:06,396
Anything could be in
those crates out of Odessa.

713
01:21:08,743 --> 01:21:12,736
This one has too many moving parts,
too many unknowns.

714
01:21:14,215 --> 01:21:17,251
It's your call.

715
01:21:17,286 --> 01:21:18,586
Where you at?

716
01:21:18,621 --> 01:21:21,355
The message from Yero
locates the agency and the office

717
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:24,258
where the leak is coming from.
I call that progress.

718
01:21:24,293 --> 01:21:28,251
So, let's take it to the limit one more time.

719
01:22:22,483 --> 01:22:26,476
Move!

720
01:22:30,558 --> 01:22:34,551
We got to go. <i>Rápido.</i>

721
01:22:47,742 --> 01:22:49,710
Let's go. Let's go. Come on, let's go.

722
01:22:49,745 --> 01:22:51,946
- How we looking?
- I can take one more.

723
01:22:51,981 --> 01:22:55,939
Good. Let's move!

724
01:22:59,755 --> 01:23:03,713
That's it. Take off.

725
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:11,755
Let's hit it.

726
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:23,944
All right, Julio, break the lines
and straighten the load.

727
01:23:23,979 --> 01:23:24,979
Break the lines.

728
01:23:25,014 --> 01:23:28,972
We'll rendezvous in about eight hours.

729
01:23:40,461 --> 01:23:43,464
<i>If there's any place</i>
<i>where most people feel at home,</i>

730
01:23:43,499 --> 01:23:45,499
<i>it's right in their own backyard.</i>

731
01:23:45,534 --> 01:23:49,492
<i>And that's why today, more than ever,</i>
<i>homeowners are asking,</i>

732
01:23:50,004 --> 01:23:52,907
<i>"What can we do to make</i>
<i>our backyard a paradise,</i>

733
01:23:52,942 --> 01:23:55,943
<i>"a vacation destination</i>
<i>you can visit anytime,</i>

734
01:23:55,978 --> 01:23:59,936
<i>"without the hassle of air travel,</i>
<i>or even starting the car?"</i>

735
01:24:00,014 --> 01:24:04,007
<i>We'll answer these questions</i>
<i>and much more.</i>

736
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:59,929
Be loaded up in a minute.

737
01:25:18,592 --> 01:25:21,128
- Yeah?
- <i>Want you to listen to this.</i>

738
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:23,931
Who are you? Who is this?

739
01:25:23,966 --> 01:25:27,924
<i>Shut up and listen.</i>

740
01:25:36,911 --> 01:25:38,913
<i>Developing news</i>
<i>in weather today,</i>

741
01:25:38,948 --> 01:25:40,581
<i>there's new activity in the tropics.</i>

742
01:25:40,616 --> 01:25:43,684
<i>We turn things over to meteorologist</i>
<i>Ryan Phillips. What's developing?</i>

743
01:25:43,719 --> 01:25:46,153
<i>Coincidentally,</i>
<i>three years ago today, July 24th,</i>

744
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:48,923
<i>that's when Hurricane Danny</i>
<i>formed out across the Atlantic Basin.</i>

745
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:51,926
<i>And now we have our own tropical troubles</i>
<i>as Hurricane Ernesto, a category...</i>

746
01:25:51,961 --> 01:25:55,496
Somebody's proving it's right now.

747
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:56,564
Yeah.

748
01:25:56,599 --> 01:25:57,765
<i>All right, Ryan. Thanks.</i>

749
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,900
<i>And we've got</i>
<i>some good news about your electric bill.</i>

750
01:25:59,935 --> 01:26:01,535
<i>Your rates will not be going up.</i>

751
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:04,505
Say hello, honey.

752
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:07,208
Some nice friends you got.

753
01:26:07,243 --> 01:26:11,201
Urban trailer trash
with B.O. and a noisy fucking...

754
01:26:23,657 --> 01:26:26,227
Yeah.

755
01:26:26,262 --> 01:26:30,220
They know.

756
01:26:33,767 --> 01:26:35,169
Pay attention.

757
01:26:35,204 --> 01:26:39,162
I will now tell you when
and how this load will get dropped.

758
01:26:39,206 --> 01:26:41,509
This is happening our way.

759
01:26:41,544 --> 01:26:44,645
<i>You have 30 minutes from right now</i>
<i>to enter Government Cut.</i>

760
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,715
<i>Head up the Miami River.</i>
<i>You have 15 minutes</i>

761
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:49,950
<i>to make it to the First Avenue bridge.</i>

762
01:26:49,985 --> 01:26:53,921
When you're there,
I'll call you with the exact drop point.

763
01:26:53,956 --> 01:26:57,914
You fuck up, we fuck her up.

764
01:27:04,098 --> 01:27:08,091
<i>It's me. We're on.</i>

765
01:27:14,308 --> 01:27:15,776
What's the deal?

766
01:27:15,811 --> 01:27:19,769
For doing the deed, 30% off the load.

767
01:27:23,083 --> 01:27:27,076
J.C.!

768
01:28:08,362 --> 01:28:10,364
Zito!

769
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:14,368
Zito, you copy?

770
01:28:14,403 --> 01:28:18,361
<i>Don't hear you. Go again.</i>

771
01:28:20,808 --> 01:28:24,011
Zito, do you copy?

772
01:28:24,046 --> 01:28:28,004
<i>Go to marine 78.</i>

773
01:28:34,355 --> 01:28:38,348
<i>They took Trudy hostage.</i>

774
01:28:38,993 --> 01:28:41,161
What's the ask? What do they want?

775
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:44,365
<i>They want us to drop the load their way.</i>

776
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,000
<i>They got eyes on us.</i>

777
01:28:46,035 --> 01:28:49,993
<i>We're on a timetable. The next call that</i>
<i>we get will be at the First Avenue bridge.</i>

778
01:28:50,204 --> 01:28:51,672
<i>Where do we hook up?</i>

779
01:28:51,707 --> 01:28:53,941
Hook up at the Port bridge ahead of that.

780
01:28:53,976 --> 01:28:57,934
<i>Port bridge.</i>
<i>I got it.</i>

781
01:29:00,948 --> 01:29:03,083
<i>What did Trudy say?</i>

782
01:29:03,118 --> 01:29:06,353
Urban trailer park. Did you hear the roar?

783
01:29:06,388 --> 01:29:08,789
- Was it near the freeway?
- <i>No, no, no. Airport.</i>

784
01:29:08,824 --> 01:29:10,824
<i>Sonny, Rico,</i>

785
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:12,426
where is the drop site?

786
01:29:12,461 --> 01:29:15,029
<i>We'll know last minute.</i>
<i>They got Trudy.</i>

787
01:29:15,064 --> 01:29:17,231
Maybe in a trailer park near an airport.

788
01:29:17,266 --> 01:29:21,224
Look for antennas.
These guys manage a lot of signal traffic.

789
01:29:21,368 --> 01:29:24,371
They will not kill her
until they've got the goods.

790
01:29:24,406 --> 01:29:27,374
Once they've got the goods, she is dead.

791
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:31,378
When they see the boat, we slow this down.
Buy some time.

792
01:29:31,413 --> 01:29:34,048
Did they prove she's alive?

793
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:38,041
That's the first thing they put through.

794
01:29:48,762 --> 01:29:52,755
<i>Try Paradise Trailer Park near the airport.</i>

795
01:30:13,153 --> 01:30:17,146
<i>Sonny, I got a possible.</i>
<i>It has three HF antennas.</i>

796
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:21,451
<i>It's on the corner lot at the southeast end.</i>

797
01:31:10,377 --> 01:31:12,379
For you.

798
01:31:12,414 --> 01:31:14,181
Hello?

799
01:31:14,216 --> 01:31:16,750
Where are you?

800
01:31:16,785 --> 01:31:19,920
Geneva.

801
01:31:19,955 --> 01:31:23,824
Yero's buyer jacked one of our people.

802
01:31:23,859 --> 01:31:26,493
- What the fuck's going on?
- <i>What's he want?</i>

803
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:28,962
<i>To control the delivery.</i>

804
01:31:28,997 --> 01:31:32,533
It's Yero, not the buyer.

805
01:31:32,568 --> 01:31:34,835
<i>He wants to kill you.</i>

806
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:38,071
<i>I do not know what shit he's pulling, okay?</i>

807
01:31:38,106 --> 01:31:42,064
But whatever he tells you to do,
do not do it.

808
01:31:49,449 --> 01:31:53,442
- So?
- It's José Yero. Be a hit and a rip.

809
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:00,894
<i>Slow as we can go.</i>

810
01:32:00,929 --> 01:32:04,887
<i>Two and a half minutes</i>
<i>before we hit the drop site.</i>

811
01:32:05,899 --> 01:32:09,892
Copy that.

812
01:32:52,145 --> 01:32:56,138
Hold it.

813
01:33:31,585 --> 01:33:35,578
Clear.

814
01:34:01,682 --> 01:34:04,651
<i>Sonny. Ricardo.</i>

815
01:34:04,686 --> 01:34:06,186
Copy.

816
01:34:06,221 --> 01:34:10,179
<i>I'm approaching on a west parallel street.</i>

817
01:34:11,325 --> 01:34:15,318
It's clear. Sonny's in position on the east.

818
01:34:18,198 --> 01:34:22,191
Four people. Two shooters.

819
01:34:45,659 --> 01:34:49,652
Milano's Pizza.

820
01:34:55,535 --> 01:34:57,604
You order pizza?

821
01:34:57,639 --> 01:35:01,597
No.

822
01:35:06,246 --> 01:35:08,382
Hold it!

823
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:09,783
Hold it!

824
01:35:09,818 --> 01:35:13,776
Drop the detonator!

825
01:35:16,656 --> 01:35:20,649
Drop the detonator!

826
01:35:26,233 --> 01:35:30,226
Leon, no.

827
01:35:49,089 --> 01:35:53,082
Shoot me, she dies.

828
01:35:53,593 --> 01:35:56,763
Shoot me. Go ahead.

829
01:35:56,798 --> 01:35:59,266
Fuck it. We can all go.

830
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:00,700
- That's cool.
- That's not what happens.

831
01:36:00,735 --> 01:36:03,270
What will happen is...

832
01:36:03,305 --> 01:36:06,840
What will happen is, I will put a round
at 2,700 feet per second

833
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:09,409
into the medulla at the base of your brain,

834
01:36:09,444 --> 01:36:13,113
and you will be dead from the neck down
before your body knows it.

835
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:16,650
Your finger won't even twitch.
Only you get dead.

836
01:36:16,685 --> 01:36:19,519
So, tell me, sport, do you believe that?

837
01:36:19,554 --> 01:36:23,512
Hey...

838
01:36:25,659 --> 01:36:29,652
Get down!

839
01:36:32,732 --> 01:36:36,725
- Be still.
- We got her.

840
01:37:05,132 --> 01:37:09,125
- Motherfucker!
- He's dead.

841
01:37:09,436 --> 01:37:13,429
All right?

842
01:37:28,722 --> 01:37:29,789
<i>José.</i>

843
01:37:29,824 --> 01:37:33,782
Those guys and your product
are a no-show.

844
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:49,843
Stay here until we clear. Do you hear me?

845
01:37:49,878 --> 01:37:52,145
Our QTH is C-33.

846
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:56,138
We are in the northeast corner
of the trailer park.

847
01:37:56,249 --> 01:38:00,242
Clear!

848
01:38:20,173 --> 01:38:24,166
Maria.

849
01:39:00,747 --> 01:39:02,449
Get out of the car.
- I already called the medic.

850
01:39:02,484 --> 01:39:04,384
Get out!

851
01:39:04,419 --> 01:39:08,377
Open the door.

852
01:39:09,256 --> 01:39:10,790
Open the door.

853
01:39:13,728 --> 01:39:17,686
Come on.

854
01:39:49,896 --> 01:39:53,733
You know what gets me?

855
01:39:53,768 --> 01:39:57,570
The prospect of her losing her life.

856
01:39:57,605 --> 01:40:01,563
Of her losing her life
over this bullshit line of work.

857
01:40:01,941 --> 01:40:05,934
- Is that what she thinks?
- No, it's what I think.

858
01:40:05,979 --> 01:40:09,849
She'd tell me,
"Rico, I ain't playing. This is real.

859
01:40:09,884 --> 01:40:12,652
"Same as you. No less than you."

860
01:40:12,687 --> 01:40:16,645
Yeah.

861
01:40:17,891 --> 01:40:21,884
Hey.

862
01:40:22,629 --> 01:40:26,622
She's in recovery.
She has burns to 15% of her body.

863
01:40:27,334 --> 01:40:31,327
We're gonna keep her totally sedated
with a complete muscle relaxant.

864
01:40:31,838 --> 01:40:34,040
She's in a coma.

865
01:40:34,075 --> 01:40:38,033
And her right lung is collapsed,
burst spleen.

866
01:40:40,413 --> 01:40:42,048
So what's her chances?

867
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:44,584
The brain swelling worries us the most.

868
01:40:44,619 --> 01:40:48,577
You relieve the pressure?
- Not surgically. It's too diffuse.

869
01:40:48,722 --> 01:40:52,715
And any complication,
an infection, and she's...

870
01:40:55,428 --> 01:40:59,421
She's in bad shape.

871
01:41:03,903 --> 01:41:07,674
I will recover the load,

872
01:41:07,709 --> 01:41:09,609
but all I know

873
01:41:09,644 --> 01:41:13,012
is we don't have our load.
The Americans have our load.

874
01:41:13,047 --> 01:41:17,005
So I plead with you to look at this.

875
01:41:21,688 --> 01:41:25,681
Go ahead.

876
01:41:38,171 --> 01:41:42,164
Do you see this?

877
01:41:49,082 --> 01:41:53,075
This is not casual.

878
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:41,768
Yeah.

879
01:42:41,803 --> 01:42:44,637
<i>You okay?</i>
<i>I heard some bad shit happened</i>

880
01:42:44,672 --> 01:42:48,630
<i>with the crazy whites at a trailer park.</i>

881
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,882
Cut the crap.

882
01:42:55,917 --> 01:42:59,875
<i>You got my product, man.</i>

883
01:43:00,453 --> 01:43:02,222
- <i>You got my money.</i>
- That's right.

884
01:43:02,257 --> 01:43:04,023
- <i>Here's the deal.</i>
- We have a deal.

885
01:43:04,058 --> 01:43:07,527
Here's a new deal, cash money.

886
01:43:07,562 --> 01:43:11,520
Three a ki times 4,000 ki's is 12 mil.

887
01:43:12,599 --> 01:43:14,100
And we ain't waiting for a back nine.

888
01:43:14,135 --> 01:43:16,169
We had a different deal.

889
01:43:16,204 --> 01:43:20,162
This is the only deal, or else
I offload your shit to some other buyer.

890
01:43:21,741 --> 01:43:25,734
Mail you a refund, maybe.

891
01:43:28,648 --> 01:43:32,641
Okay, man. Let's do this.

892
01:43:33,019 --> 01:43:37,012
And I want you there.
None of your peckerwood proxies.

893
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:39,726
I'm out of town.

894
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:43,719
- <i>I'll wait.</i>
- Why?

895
01:43:44,297 --> 01:43:47,033
'Cause if you're there,

896
01:43:47,068 --> 01:43:51,004
guarantees it's for real.

897
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:52,605
Tomorrow night.

898
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:56,598
<i>I be there. We call you with the place.</i>

899
01:43:56,976 --> 01:44:00,969
You got my number.

900
01:44:02,148 --> 01:44:06,141
Yeah, well, follow up with the ME,
identify off the DNA samples.

901
01:44:08,955 --> 01:44:12,592
Yero's coming back to the U.S.
to recover his product.

902
01:44:12,627 --> 01:44:16,585
He's coming back himself.

903
01:44:20,066 --> 01:44:21,768
How do we deal? How do we do a deal?

904
01:44:21,803 --> 01:44:25,761
I mean, how's anybody
gonna believe anybody after tonight?

905
01:44:25,872 --> 01:44:27,807
Nobody does. He's compelled.

906
01:44:27,842 --> 01:44:31,800
We got his 4,000 ki's,
worth $60 million at wholesale.

907
01:44:32,612 --> 01:44:36,605
That's right.

908
01:44:40,019 --> 01:44:43,790
All right. Now, here's what's gonna happen.

909
01:44:43,825 --> 01:44:47,783
They will change out the place at
the last minute so we can't set up on them.

910
01:44:48,561 --> 01:44:51,898
And it'll be an L-shaped ambush.

911
01:44:51,933 --> 01:44:54,300
I run it.

912
01:44:54,335 --> 01:44:58,137
I run it.

913
01:44:58,172 --> 01:45:01,040
They won't initiate
until they got eyes on the product.

914
01:45:01,075 --> 01:45:05,033
And I won't let the product come in
until we've got their shooters in our sights

915
01:45:05,244 --> 01:45:08,081
- and you have cover.
- Okay.

916
01:45:08,116 --> 01:45:12,074
I don't care how much we want this guy.

917
01:45:13,386 --> 01:45:17,379
- Clear?
- Yeah.

918
01:45:43,016 --> 01:45:44,884
What shit have you pulled?

919
01:45:44,919 --> 01:45:47,920
- You know what Jesús will do, right?
- Yes, I do.

920
01:45:49,057 --> 01:45:53,015
Do you wanna call him?

921
01:45:57,930 --> 01:46:01,923
You're all mine now.

922
01:46:12,111 --> 01:46:16,104
- It's that time.
- Yeah.

923
01:46:16,449 --> 01:46:19,452
Badges get flashed, guns come out.

924
01:46:19,487 --> 01:46:22,288
Arrests get made.

925
01:46:22,323 --> 01:46:26,281
That's what we do.

926
01:46:26,726 --> 01:46:27,894
So?

927
01:46:27,929 --> 01:46:31,887
So, fabricated identity and what's really up

928
01:46:33,299 --> 01:46:37,170
collapses into one frame.

929
01:46:37,205 --> 01:46:41,163
You ready for that on this one?

930
01:46:41,974 --> 01:46:45,967
I absolutely am not.

931
01:46:49,015 --> 01:46:52,151
So, where you at with that?

932
01:46:52,186 --> 01:46:56,144
I'm with her 100%.

933
01:47:00,927 --> 01:47:04,920
She could be a white collar money manager.
She may even be true love.

934
01:47:08,434 --> 01:47:12,427
But she's with them.

935
01:47:13,372 --> 01:47:17,365
Like Trudy would say,

936
01:47:18,044 --> 01:47:22,037
I ain't playing.

937
01:47:31,824 --> 01:47:35,027
Time.

938
01:47:35,062 --> 01:47:39,020
Let's do this.

939
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:06,926
Yeah.

940
01:48:06,961 --> 01:48:10,919
<i>I'm on them. They're clean.</i>

941
01:48:15,603 --> 01:48:17,203
What's up?

942
01:48:17,238 --> 01:48:19,205
The location got changed.

943
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:23,198
Bojean shipyard, 27th and the river.

944
01:49:17,196 --> 01:49:21,189
I can't find the shooters.

945
01:49:21,234 --> 01:49:22,501
Stall.

946
01:49:22,536 --> 01:49:26,494
Copy that.

947
01:49:33,546 --> 01:49:37,539
- Where's the product?
- Where's the money?

948
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:40,152
How do I know
what you say is there, is there?

949
01:49:40,187 --> 01:49:41,921
Here's how that works,

950
01:49:41,956 --> 01:49:44,290
somebody from my side
lays eyes on the money.

951
01:49:44,325 --> 01:49:46,058
Only then do we call in the dope.

952
01:49:46,093 --> 01:49:48,961
Then somebody from your side
can go look at the product.

953
01:49:48,996 --> 01:49:52,498
The money's right here,
so send somebody over.

954
01:49:52,533 --> 01:49:56,491
Can't find the shooter.

955
01:50:03,576 --> 01:50:05,945
Where's Yero?

956
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:08,080
Right here!

957
01:50:08,115 --> 01:50:12,073
And I brought your friend.
<i>Oye, 'mano,</i> she mine now.

958
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:15,655
Jesús gave her to me

959
01:50:15,690 --> 01:50:19,648
to ask questions
and find out interesting things.

960
01:50:22,128 --> 01:50:24,263
We a couple now.

961
01:50:24,298 --> 01:50:28,256
After work, she and me go
catch a movie and grab a bite.

962
01:50:33,105 --> 01:50:35,241
When I get tired, I throw her away.

963
01:50:35,276 --> 01:50:38,678
Her leg in one place,
her head someplace else.

964
01:50:38,713 --> 01:50:42,671
You guys ever see that?

965
01:50:44,483 --> 01:50:47,086
Anyway, she here now

966
01:50:47,121 --> 01:50:51,079
to make sure everything go right.

967
01:50:57,596 --> 01:51:00,633
<i>Still no shooter.</i>

968
01:51:00,668 --> 01:51:04,626
My guy, show him the money.

969
01:51:05,037 --> 01:51:07,006
I don't want him!

970
01:51:07,041 --> 01:51:08,541
Why?

971
01:51:08,576 --> 01:51:11,310
- What difference does it make, Sonny?
- Listen to me, asshole,

972
01:51:11,345 --> 01:51:13,446
I do not want that motherfucker near me.

973
01:51:13,481 --> 01:51:17,439
You wanna see your dope?
You send Isabella.

974
01:51:18,951 --> 01:51:22,944
Or it travels.

975
01:51:30,129 --> 01:51:34,122
Stay here, bitch.

976
01:51:38,104 --> 01:51:42,097
Let her go.

977
01:51:45,144 --> 01:51:47,413
Check the dope,

978
01:51:47,448 --> 01:51:51,406
then come right back.

979
01:52:19,045 --> 01:52:23,038
Got one.

980
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:28,543
On the container. Hold it.

981
01:52:39,298 --> 01:52:41,133
I got number two.

982
01:52:41,168 --> 01:52:45,126
Port side, third deck,
middle of the superstructure.

983
01:52:48,174 --> 01:52:52,167
Fire.

984
01:53:46,532 --> 01:53:50,525
Go!

985
01:53:54,306 --> 01:53:58,299
Go!

986
01:54:02,681 --> 01:54:06,674
Go!

987
01:54:25,237 --> 01:54:28,407
Go!

988
01:54:28,442 --> 01:54:32,400
Move it, man. Run, run, run!

989
01:55:14,553 --> 01:55:18,546
Crockett. I'm on your right.

990
01:56:31,530 --> 01:56:35,523
Who are you?

991
01:56:40,706 --> 01:56:44,699
Who are you?

992
01:57:19,812 --> 01:57:21,613
Get up.

993
01:57:21,648 --> 01:57:25,606
Get up.

994
01:57:50,609 --> 01:57:54,146
Get in. Get in!

995
01:57:59,752 --> 01:58:03,745
- Zito?
- Yeah, he's okay.

996
01:59:19,865 --> 01:59:23,858
- What is this?
- It's a house we use.

997
01:59:34,146 --> 01:59:38,139
Gloria? Sonny. Is Frank around?

998
01:59:40,919 --> 01:59:44,912
All right. Just get him to call me right back.

999
02:00:22,261 --> 02:00:25,764
A man named Frank
is going to come in a boat.

1000
02:00:25,799 --> 02:00:27,733
He will run you into Cayo Sotavento.

1001
02:00:27,768 --> 02:00:31,726
And from there,
you can find your way to Havana.

1002
02:00:32,271 --> 02:00:36,264
And nobody will follow you.

1003
02:00:38,710 --> 02:00:42,703
Including me.

1004
02:00:54,893 --> 02:00:57,996
Remember,

1005
02:00:58,031 --> 02:01:00,933
I said

1006
02:01:00,968 --> 02:01:04,926
time is luck.

1007
02:01:05,037 --> 02:01:08,774
Yeah.

1008
02:01:08,809 --> 02:01:12,767
Luck ran out.

1009
02:01:16,348 --> 02:01:20,341
This was too good to last.

1010
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:56,203
Nurse?
