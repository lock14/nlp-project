1
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,600
Honey, I need more.

2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,660
This is gonna take all night.

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,540
Want a sandwich?

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,300
Maybe later.

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Okay.

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Hey.

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,100
Baby, where are the road snacks?

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,260
We gotta go.
Have you seen my guitar?

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Mom?

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,380
You're having a bad dream, baby.

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,180
No shit.

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,580
We're gonna have to have a
conversation about your language.

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,300
Yeah. That's clearly the biggest
problem we're having tonight.

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,620
Go back to bed.

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
Mom!
Now!

16
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,320
Whew.

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,820
Okay.

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,600
Quiet.
Quiet, Rufus.

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,660
Guess what I got for you!
Yummy, yummy! Shh!

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,800
Ooh! Look what I got ya!

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Cat.

22
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,280
Oh! Good!

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,220
There we go.

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,560
Nice Rufus.
Good dog.

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,860
See ya later.

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,180
Attention all units.

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,340
Arrest authorized.
Move in now.

28
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,440
You set?
- I'm good.

29
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,060
I have this theory.

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,400
Crime is contagious.

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,820
It's like it can just
kinda get in the air,

32
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,760
and it-- People can
catch it from each other.

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,580
And when they catch it,
they change.

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,920
And then they change...
other people.

35
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,180
The truth is we're all
capable of anything.

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,900
We don't want to believe it's true,

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,720
but it is.

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,700
I realized it for the first time

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,420
at Mindy and Bryce Arbogast's
Fourth of July party.

40
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,640
There you are!

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,920
Hi.
I knew you'd come!

42
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,180
Sorry I'm late.

43
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,100
Oh, my God.

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,260
I want you to now I forgive you.

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,880
What for?
- Don's okay?

46
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,840
He's--he's great.
We're fine. We're fine.

47
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,260
Hey, listen, I know you quit the club,

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,620
but if Don wants to play,
have him call me.

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,020
Oh, I--I'm sure he will,
but, you know,

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,980
he's got a whole bunch of big
interviews kind of lined up, and--

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,260
Yeah.
- Does he?

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,460
Uh-huh.

53
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,500
Oh, it's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,260
You're gonna be great!

55
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,180
Now--
- Yeah.

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,420
About the realtor.

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,460
I am okay about Coldwell.

58
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,540
They're big,
it makes sense.

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,140
But I would've cut my commission.

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,600
Mindy-- So just tell--What?

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,800
Oh, my God.
Bridget, I am so sorry.

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,260
It's not even listed yet.

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,140
I'm sure Don was gonna tell you.

64
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,235
To tell you the truth,
I don't really blame her.

65
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,120
I got downsized.

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,740
You're selling our house?

67
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,340
I'm no longer the breadwinner.

68
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,300
I don't bring home the bacon.

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,520
I produce no green.

70
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,020
You just-- You wanna
talk about this, sweetie?

71
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,180
Why on earth would I wanna talk about it?

72
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,460
It's over.

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,860
What is over?
- Everything.

74
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,340
No.
- Our lives!

75
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,540
Don, for God sakes!

76
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,420
You are going to find that job.

77
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,140
It's been over a year.

78
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,700
I have tried everything
I know how to try,

79
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,100
and I have failed,
all right?

80
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,540
No, no, no, no!
No, you did not fail, Don.

81
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,140
No! I refuse to believe that!

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,020
Those stupid multinational
corporations merged you out of a job!

83
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,420
So, sweetie,
you got failed on!

84
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,780
Really? You know, I am so
far past statistical comfort.

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,420
Look at this!

86
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,040
We are $286,000 in debt.

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,740
What?
- I wasn't kidding.

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
It's over.

89
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,020
Honey, why didn't you tell me?
We could have stopped.

90
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,820
What? Eating, driving,
living our lives?

91
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,100
We could live on less.
Lots of people live on less.

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,780
Absolutely. And soon,
we'll be living with them.

93
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,580
You know, hearing their
voices in the hallways,

94
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,300
smelling their cooking.

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,300
But, hey, at least we got our health.

96
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,940
Of course, we don't
have health insurance,

97
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,940
so if you need an X-ray,
I sell a kidney.

98
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,220
We'll do something.
We'll think outside the box.

99
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,620
Well, that's good, because
we're selling the box

100
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,460
and we're moving into a smaller box,

101
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,060
and soon that box will be so small,

102
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,140
it's the one they put us
in the ground with.

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,900
We'll get jobs,
any jobs, both of us,

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,580
and we're gonna make our payments
until this economy gets better, Don.

105
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,230
Yeah, well, good luck,
Bridget.

106
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,940
You've been out of
the workforce for some time.

107
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,460
Well, I've raised two children

108
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,740
and made a home.

109
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,900
My daughter is a clinical researcher

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,380
and my son is a systems analyst,

111
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,800
and my husband is,
uh, well...

112
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,240
on the sofa right now.

113
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,540
Your degree is in comparative literature.

114
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,020
Yes.

115
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,780
Sort of a slow sector
of the economy right now.

116
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,460
And your typing is sub-standard.

117
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,780
Are you proficient on
any kind of software?

118
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm good at Google.

119
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,060
Look, the truth is people
your age in the workforce

120
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,940
are generally considered...
real pains in the ass.

121
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,780
Are you aware that statement
is discriminatory and illegal?

122
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,740
See?

123
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,940
And you don't even work for me.

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,640
A drug test?

125
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,420
What kind of drugs would I have to take?

126
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Hello?

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,840
How old am I?

128
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,460
No, I haven't worked in a hotel.

129
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,220
I've enjoyed some wonderful
times at hotels.

130
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,300
Not yours.

131
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,000
As a waitress,
would--would I get benefits?

132
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,655
I don't think that's funny.

133
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,100
Of course I understand about outsourcing.

134
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,020
Yes.

135
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,435
Suppose I was willing to move to India.

136
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,100
Selina. Hi.

137
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,820
What are you doing here?
- Your check bounced.

138
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,140
That's the third one.

139
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,980
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

140
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,300
I've cleaned your house.
You owe me the money.

141
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,100
Of course.

142
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,700
Honestly, Selina, I don't really
have the money right now,

143
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,540
but as soon as we do--
and in the meantime,

144
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,220
if you need any kind of references--

145
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,260
I want cash.

146
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,860
I want cash, too.

147
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,380
Obviously, I don't really have any cash.

148
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,940
I did the work.
You owe me the money.

149
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,060
How about I come clean your house
for three weeks and we call it even?

150
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,400
My house is already clean.

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Ah!

152
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,180
That's yours.

153
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,700
Enjoy.

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Okay?

155
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,460
Oh, God.

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,040
Don't you know how to do anything?

157
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,620
We need benefits.

158
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,120
I know some place.

159
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,740
It's work like mine,
but they have benefits.

160
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,960
Why don't you do it?

161
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,660
They won't hire people
with a criminal record.

162
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,220
You have a criminal record?

163
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,100
Arson.

164
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,520
Long story.

165
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,060
Tell me about the job.

166
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,340
I didn't even know what the
Federal Reserve Bank does

167
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,740
before I came to work here.

168
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,140
Well, they set interest rates

169
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,860
and they hold extra cash from all
the other banks for safekeeping.

170
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,360
Yeah--No, I--I asked my husband.

171
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,380
Now that could be your
savings account right there.

172
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,100
I don't think so.
It has money in it.

173
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,740
Oh, we're running
a little bit behind today.

174
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,940
And don't think they won't notice.

175
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,900
Oh, they tell you it's for security,

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,180
but meanwhile,
the guys in the ties

177
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,380
are keeping track of how many
times a day we need a goddamn pee.

178
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,700
Ha! This place is like
a Las Vegas casino.

179
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,500
No windows,
no privacy,

180
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,580
and a shitload of money all around here.

181
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,060
The only difference is
nobody here ever has any fun.

182
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,240
Okay, 12.

183
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,875
I'm shifting to the east vault.

184
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,220
Now, keep your head down in here.

185
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
You know what I mean?

186
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,965
And don't spray directly on the monitors.

187
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,860
The secret here:

188
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,200
Don't want anything.

189
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,500
Don't even think about wanting it.

190
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,980
What you can think about,

191
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,280
what you can want...

192
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,400
is your job.

193
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,000
I do, yes.
Yes, sir, I do.

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,820
I--I am thinking about wanting...the job!

195
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,340
That's what I'm thinking
about wanting, sir.

196
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,245
Thank you so much for helping me.

197
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,700
Whoo!
Check this out!

198
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,140
How you doing, Nina?

199
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,620
Not bad.

200
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,020
New girl.

201
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Hey.

202
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Hard to watch, huh?

203
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Worn out.

204
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,460
We get the new bills from the mint.

205
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,780
There goes your car payment.

206
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,920
Oops! That's a new sofa.

207
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,910
Get the one by the desk there.

208
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,440
In.

209
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Whoa.

210
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Let's go!

211
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,440
It may not seem like much,

212
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,080
but I do feel like,
in our own way,

213
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,960
we do something kinda important here.

214
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Oh.

215
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,720
Oh! Oh, God, no!

216
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,020
How's it going?

217
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
God.

218
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,100
Hello?

219
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,060
Bridget!
- Mindy.

220
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,660
Hi!
- There you are.

221
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,900
I was just thinking about you actually.

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,980
We've got to talk.

223
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,060
Mindy, you know what?

224
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm out to dinner right now

225
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,220
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

226
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,600
I'll call you back.

227
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,740
I would love to do lunch.

228
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,940
Lunch? Great.
Tomorrow?

229
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,460
Well, not tomorrow.

230
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,875
But how about, um...
this weekend maybe?

231
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,920
That would be wonderful.

232
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,240
Anyway...bye.

233
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Bye.
- Bye.

234
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,620
Hey.

235
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,460
How'd it go?

236
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,300
Oh.

237
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,980
Honey.

238
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,420
You wanna talk about it?

239
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,020
You remember that Frontline we saw

240
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,260
on Third World slave labor?

241
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,020
Yeah.

242
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,095
Then I don't have to talk about it.

243
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Oh!

244
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,040
Don!

245
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,120
Don! Don!

246
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,960
You wanna know what she told me?

247
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,820
How the whole thing got started?

248
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Oh.

249
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,100
Looks like we're gonna
need a new one of these.

250
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,040
Let me show ya. You see?
You broke it right there.

251
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,160
She went shopping.

252
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,880
There's something about stuff...

253
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,660
that's on display.

254
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,200
See, even if you've got the same stuff,

255
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,720
they way they lay it out

256
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
makes you want.

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,080
Wanting is the root of all...

258
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
needing stuff.

259
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,580
I'll tell you what.

260
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,020
They say money can't buy happiness,

261
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,960
but it sure as hell buys everything else.

262
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,980
That's what she said

263
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,700
she was doing when
she got the whole idea.

264
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Just shopping.

265
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Being a good American.

266
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,620
Do you ever really think about money?

267
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,860
People think that they think
about money all the time.

268
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,840
But how often do we really look
at the actual physical cash?

269
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,620
Once you start to really
think about money,

270
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,120
you realize this stuff
gets touched a lot.

271
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,180
Who had it before you?

272
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,880
And what did they do with it?

273
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,020
It gets put in places you
may not wanna know about.

274
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,500
When you really stop and think about it--

275
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,980
money is actually pretty disgusting.

276
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,245
Well, I mean, we're a consumer
society, aren't we?

277
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
She got consumed.

278
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,160
We receive currency from over a
thousand banks in the Tenth District,

279
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,440
which arrives here and enters
a totally secure environment.

280
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,680
Utility rooms,
work rooms,

281
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,980
lunchroom,

282
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,880
lockers, stairs,
elevators.

283
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,520
Everyone, everywhere,
every minute.

284
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,640
Cash sorted.

285
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,820
We find one of only three
keys in the entire system

286
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,060
that will open a cash cart.

287
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,260
The Treasury Department inspection room,

288
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,220
where the second key
is held by Agent Wayne here,

289
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,660
decorated 30-year veteran
of the Secret Service--

290
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,160
Lost a tooth taking down Squeaky Fromme.

291
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,100
Nighttime. The key is locked
up in my security office.

292
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,880
The final step of the process,

293
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,960
the shredding room.

294
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,720
And here's the third key
wired to the system.

295
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,380
And that's all she wrote.

296
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,965
After this, there's
nothing left to steal.

297
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,940
Oh, this is good.

298
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,360
Okey-dokey. Here we go.

299
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,280
Okay.
Good enough.

300
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,640
Thank you so much, Don.

301
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,500
I'm gonna take care of you.

302
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,180
It'll be gone in no time.

303
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,560
My best to Bridget.

304
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,860
Oh, I'm sorry,
excuse me,

305
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,300
but it looks like you might
have dropped some money.

306
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,420
No, that's not mine.

307
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,420
Really?

308
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
Money?

309
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,460
I guess I ought to turn it
into the office, though, huh?

310
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,220
Oh.

311
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,800
Right.

312
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,560
He's a big fat no.

313
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,800
Oh, she's so in love with me.

314
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,180
I got this.
- Okay.

315
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Oh, I got it.

316
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Hey, beautiful.

317
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,280
You know, you got me so
cuckoo for your... cocoa puffs.

318
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
You hear me, baby?

319
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,420
You know what I think of
when somebody calls me 'baby?'

320
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay, tell me in my good ear.

321
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,020
I think of years of sleep deprivation.

322
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,440
Oh. Mmm.

323
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,060
Spit-up on the shoulder
of my last clean shirt.

324
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,860
Diarrhea in a diaper,
the green kind.

325
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,700
See, now that's the image
you just left in my mind.

326
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,980
Now what do you want?

327
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,580
Nothing, Nina. You have a good evening.

328
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,860
Fool.

329
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,100
Hey, call me.

330
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,520
What?

331
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,540
You got to howl at the bitches, dawg.

332
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,820
The woman's a working mother, Shaun.

333
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,900
So?

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,120
I'm not your dawg.

335
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,120
More for me.

336
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Oh, boy.

337
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,620
You wanna carpool tomorrow?

338
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Huh?

339
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,700
Oh. Uh...

340
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,140
can I ask you something?

341
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Excuse me?

342
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,300
Are you ever tempted?

343
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,980
What, him?

344
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,220
You find that appealing?

345
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,580
Ecch.
- No, no.

346
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,700
You think what I want
after along day on my feet

347
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,700
is to lie down under some skinny kid

348
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,060
for three minutes of push-ups?

349
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,420
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

350
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,940
I got around plenty in my party
girl days, but I got kids now.

351
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,440
No, no, I meant...

352
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,860
Don't you ever get tempted to just slip

353
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,940
a couple hundreds into your pocket?

354
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,820
Okay, I knew you didn't
look like a janitor.

355
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,020
Huh?
What do you mean?

356
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,740
Boy, they are good.

357
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,020
Those guys are sneaky,
I'll give 'em that.

358
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,920
What? You think I'm a weasel?

359
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,300
Or like a mole thing?

360
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,120
No. I'm serious.

361
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,460
I'm asking.
Just once?

362
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,100
Ever?

363
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,620
Is that what you being here is all about?

364
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,160
Look, nobody, not once,

365
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,340
has ever beaten the system
in, like, a hundred years.

366
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,060
So what are you, some kinda
like super genius or something?

367
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,900
No. That's what's so funny.
It's just staring you in the face.

368
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,820
You only have to see it.

369
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,700
And you don't think they've seen it?

370
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,100
No.
- Why?

371
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,175
Because they don't empty the trash.

372
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,140
What?
- No.

373
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,280
Uh-uh.
Leave me alone.

374
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,700
Here, Mom. You need
to sign this for school.

375
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,140
What is it?

376
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,420
It's a list of weapons
we're not allowed to bring.

377
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,580
Like there's some weapons
you are allowed to bring?

378
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,860
You just have to sign
that you understand.

379
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,445
Oh, I understand.
I just don't understand.

380
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,460
Hello?

381
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,685
You don't want the money?

382
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,180
I don't wanna go crazy,

383
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,580
and that's what makes everybody crazy.

384
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,940
Everybody always wants everything.

385
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,460
I don't want things I can't have.

386
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Do you live in America?

387
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,300
Hey, Mom, we got a white woman outside.

388
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,220
What's she doing?

389
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
Just standing there.

390
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,940
She's our new lawn ornament.

391
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,760
Well, she's coming.

392
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,740
Find someone else.
- I can't.

393
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,940
It only works with you in the
shredding room and someone from carts.

394
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,900
It might not even work then.

395
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,400
Maybe I'm crazy.
You tell me.

396
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,740
Okay.
All right.

397
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,740
Did you do something
wrong at school today?

398
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,050
No. You?
- Not with a lock.

399
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,980
How did you get this?

400
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,740
The same as the Fed does.

401
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,680
Master Lock Company,
mail order.

402
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,420
Completely legal.

403
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,420
The key won't fit.
No, it won't.

404
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,860
The Fed resets the cylinders

405
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,880
and makes their own keys.

406
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,860
Just think about it.

407
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,380
I'm not gonna think about it.

408
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,100
Oh, okay. That's a good idea.
Don't think about it.

409
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,260
I won't.

410
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,140
Great. Great.
Whatever you do

411
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,940
don't think about it.

412
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Give it up, Miss Daisy!

413
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,580
I have kids!

414
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,100
Yeah, well, so do I!

415
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,940
My husband and I after all these
years are still paying off--

416
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,860
I'm not talking about your
upper middle-class problems.

417
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
I'm a single mom.

418
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,140
If this thing goes bad,
I lose my children.

419
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,720
Oh.
- Uh-huh.

420
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,320
Now if that happens,

421
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
I will kill you.

422
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,180
You scared of me?

423
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,140
Yeah.

424
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,100
Good.

425
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
Now, who do we get from carts?

426
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,525
Somebody is definitely peeing in her cup.

427
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,420
Um...

428
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,460
Here, let me get that for you.

429
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,140
Here you go.

430
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
What on earth?

431
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Here.
- Thanks.

432
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
There you go.

433
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,880
Okay, then.

434
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,900
Well, we're not looking for a Girl Scout.

435
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,640
Well, we didn't find one.

436
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,020
When I was 9 years old,

437
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,100
I found out that every day
for the rest of my life,

438
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,460
I would be sticking myself with a needle.

439
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Early onset diabetes.

440
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,920
Okay.

441
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,380
I'm in.
- You're in.

442
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,660
Let's do it.

443
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,320
What?
That's it?

444
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,220
You don't want to think about it?

445
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,540
What's there to think about?

446
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,680
The...consequences.

447
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,460
Nope.

448
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,140
I'm down.

449
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,400
When do we go?

450
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,300
Well, I don't know.
I mean, obviously,

451
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,020
we have to review the plan.

452
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,500
Well, I got the plan.
Do you got the plan?

453
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,620
Do you have the lock?

454
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,260
She has it.

455
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
So why not?

456
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,060
'Why not' seems like a really
bad reason to do something,

457
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,980
don't you think?

458
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Why?

459
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Okay.

460
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,020
Why not?

461
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
All right.

462
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,420
We need a 'go' code.

463
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,500
Okay, I'm sorry,
but a 'go' code?

464
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,260
I don't think we want
to be walking around the Fed

465
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,940
saying 'Let's rob the Fed
today at work,' right?

466
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,700
No, you probably don't
want to be saying that.

467
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,420
There you go.
- Oops.

468
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
Thanks.

469
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,340
Okay.

470
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,100
We need a code word like, um--

471
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,580
Um, like...
- Liftoff.

472
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,320
Yeah. Liftoff.

473
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,740
That comes up really
easy in conversation.

474
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,140
Right.

475
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,540
'Cause you don't want it to be
something you could say accidentally.

476
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,260
You know, like, if our
'go' code was 'hot',

477
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,220
and I saw you and I said, 'Hey,
Nina, you look really hot today,'

478
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,820
and then you go and you
start stealing money,

479
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,420
that could be a problem.

480
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,700
The last time somebody
told me I looked hot

481
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,540
was about seven years nine months ago.

482
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,940
And I don't want to hear it again.

483
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,700
It's been seven years

484
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,940
since you had sex?

485
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,460
All right. Can we just
please focus for a minute?

486
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,900
I think that the signal should be...

487
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,320
a gesture, basically.

488
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,380
How about something that doesn't get us

489
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,980
into some sort of an incident?

490
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,900
How about something more like...

491
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,360
um, I don't know,
like this?

492
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,060
See?

493
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Right.

494
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,340
Works for me.

495
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,140
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

496
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,100
So...that's it, then.

497
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
We're good to go.

498
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,060
I know.

499
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,580
Um...

500
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,860
Jackie?

501
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,660
We need to talk to you about the drugs.

502
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,540
Okay.

503
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,620
It's none of our business--

504
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,340
It is our business.

505
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,260
We could go to jail.

506
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,840
Plus it's stupid.

507
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,500
If we see any signs that the drugs

508
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,340
are affecting your abilities in any way--

509
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,660
In any way--

510
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,740
We're gonna pull the plug.

511
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,700
Do you understand that?

512
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,060
Yeah. No warnings,
no excuses, no apologies.

513
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
You mess up, it's over.

514
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,985
Is this like an intervention?

515
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
You damn right.

516
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Wow.

517
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,460
I guess I could have told them,

518
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,200
but I was just really...

519
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,560
touched.

520
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,405
That they would take the trouble
and everything, you know?

521
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,620
This takeover bid is irresponsible!

522
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,800
I think the CEO has lost his mind.

523
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,060
And honestly,

524
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,300
the whole board ought to get 20 years--

525
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,520
Yeah, right.

526
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,940
Like white guys are gonna do time.

527
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,020
20 years?
Man, we'd get that

528
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,420
if we stole a candy bar
from a convenience store.

529
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,600
Hey! You listen to me!

530
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,500
You ain't no man
making jokes about crime.

531
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,740
Ain't no men in prison.

532
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,780
Just corpses don't know
enough to lie down.

533
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,860
Now that is not who you're gonna be.

534
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,060
I don't care what I gotta do,
you're not going that way.

535
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,540
Do you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.

536
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,860
I was gonna go steal candy bars,

537
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
but now I won't.

538
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,980
Come here.
Give me some love.

539
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,880
Okay.

540
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
That's good.

541
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
What?

542
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
You got a boyfriend?

543
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,820
What happened?

544
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,100
Just quit yelling.

545
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,220
I'm not yelling!
- Yes, you are! That's yelling.

546
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,580
Shh! Quiet.
- Not so loud.

547
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,420
Do you want to tell us
what happened, Jackie?

548
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,460
I had a bad feeling.

549
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,080
You had a...bad feeling.

550
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,100
I take my feelings seriously.

551
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,500
So nobody...said
anything or did anything?

552
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:29,820
No.

553
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,480
I had a bad feeling.

554
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,820
Okay, I'm sorry.

555
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,060
That's it.
I'm outta here.

556
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,340
No, no, wait!
- Wait? Wait for what?

557
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,620
Huh? The alarms?
They're going off!

558
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,395
Dimwit junkie alert!
Whacked out Martha Stewart wannabe.

559
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,145
What the hell was I thinking?

560
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,015
Seriously, it was real bad!

561
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,700
Quit pissing and moaning, people.

562
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,840
It's in your contract.

563
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,240
Section 41: 'Employees will submit

564
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,400
to full random security searches.'

565
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,880
Everyone, everywhere,
every minute.

566
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,140
Let's go.
Come on.

567
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,740
Ma'am?

568
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,280
Thank you.

569
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Come on, let's go.

570
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,240
4-9-3-7.

571
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
49-37.

572
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
Hold on.

573
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,140
Thanks.

574
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
It's my job.

575
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Right.
Mine, too.

576
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Back to work, then.

577
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,020
4937.

578
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,500
4937.

579
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
4937.

580
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Tilt down a little.

581
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,180
Down.

582
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,320
Sorry?
- About 9 degrees.

583
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Zoom in.

584
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,515
What we really need is thermal imaging.

585
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Amateur.

586
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,880
Shh!

587
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,880
Now I've got two reasons
to love control top.

588
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,580
I'm gotta get myself
some boring underpants.

589
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,900
I know.

590
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,995
I bet Victoria never had
this particular secret.

591
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,980
I can't get this in there.

592
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,280
Oh, that hurts.

593
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
We've gotta hurry.

594
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,840
Okay, there we go.
Got it?

595
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,175
All right, now everybody
quit smiling. Quit smiling.

596
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Next up?

597
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,700
Ahem.
- Oh.

598
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,880
Okay, thank you.

599
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Thank you.

600
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,660
How you doing today?

601
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,580
I'm good. You?

602
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,760
I'm...

603
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,740
I'm good.

604
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,720
Good.
Um, you know what?

605
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,980
I think you are always just...

606
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,940
You're so...

607
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,320
polite.

608
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Next!

609
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,380
What goes around comes around.

610
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Too true.

611
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,500
Spoken like a real gentleman.

612
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,700
I don't want to be forward and
this is not the best place to talk--

613
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Mrs. Cardigan!

614
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,440
Oh--
- Step back, please.

615
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,560
I think you dropped this.

616
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,060
Oh.

617
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,620
Thank you, Mr. Glover.

618
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,360
Everyone, everywhere,
every minute.

619
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,360
Carry on.

620
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,740
I was wondering maybe...
do you like jazz?

621
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,540
What?

622
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,320
Oh. Uh...no.
Sorry.

623
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,460
'Do you like jazz?'

624
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,020
Shut up!

625
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,120
Next!

626
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,980
Okay, wait a second.
Oh, 183.

627
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
183 equals...

628
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,980
Can everyone count to themselves, please?

629
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,660
What's up with all
these one-dollar bills?

630
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,820
I was in a hurry.

631
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,580
We're gonna have to get
this bug worked out.

632
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,720
Only large bills.

633
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,080
Okay. I have $32,000.

634
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,520
31.
- 28.

635
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,300
Damn.
- What?

636
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,460
What's the matter?

637
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,420
If we each give her one,
that leaves a thousand,

638
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,380
which is 333 each.

639
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,620
There's gonna be a dollar left over.

640
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,800
I might have change.

641
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Keep the change.

642
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,080
Gimme the money, baby!

643
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,400
Let's see mama making that cash!

644
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Don.

645
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Hi.

646
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Wanna lap dance?

647
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,260
You know something?
I would have thought

648
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,180
you would have been a whole lot happier.

649
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,660
Oh, forgive me for getting
insufficient kicks

650
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,860
when somebody I'm married to
commits a felony.

651
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,180
Don!

652
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,140
This money doesn't even
officially exist anymore.

653
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,540
That's the beauty of the whole thing.

654
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,880
Look at it.
It's worn out.

655
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,020
It's gonna be shredded.

656
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,180
So what do we do?
We take some. We spend it.

657
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,380
It goes to another bank.
It's still worn out.

658
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,740
So what do they do?

659
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,820
They pull it from the system...again!

660
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,060
It's like we're stealing
the same money over and over.

661
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,460
In fact, it's not even
like stealing money at all.

662
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,860
It's more like recycling.

663
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,660
Oh, recycling!

664
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,660
Yeah, your defense attorney's
gonna love that one, Bridget.

665
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,020
I'm not gonna get caught.

666
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,140
My God, Don, we're very careful.

667
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,380
We have signals and 'go' codes.

668
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,780
We have a system here that works--

669
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,860
Oh, please, God. Tell me you're
not planning on doing this again.

670
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,140
What--what, do you think I'm stupid?

671
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,860
Of course we're going to do this again.

672
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,060
At least until we get out of the hole.

673
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,900
Four or five more times.

674
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,380
Nina gets school paper,

675
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,940
and Jackie, honestly,
I really don't know

676
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,340
what the hell she is going to do.

677
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,180
You know something?
You've gone insane, Bridget.

678
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,380
Honey, you see
a $20 bill on the sidewalk.

679
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,060
Let me just ask you.
What do you do?

680
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,440
Do you walk away? No.

681
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,060
You know, I guess it would depend

682
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,940
on whether or not the sidewalk

683
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,380
were locked inside a Federal bank!

684
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,740
Honestly! When you have spent
months cleaning their toilets,

685
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,180
the whole Federal bank thing

686
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,820
doesn't seem like such a great big deal.

687
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,220
What about the overall
system of monetary flow, hmm?

688
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,460
What?

689
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,660
You know that they print
a certain amount of money

690
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,620
relating to assets in
other parts of the system.

691
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,060
Uh-huh. Where?
I don't know, but--

692
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,580
Yes!
- Seriously, you could be...

693
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,300
you could be throwing off
the entire balance of trade.

694
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,180
You could be endangering the
dollar against the--the yen.

695
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,080
Don, I am gonna keep doing this.

696
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,740
The yen is just gonna
have to take care of itself.

697
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,380
See, the problem is

698
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,940
we just don't accept
mid-semester transfers

699
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,100
or financial aid students. We--

700
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,100
I won't be needing financial aid.

701
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,620
I'm sorry?

702
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,420
I can pay now...
for the full year.

703
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,940
Oh.

704
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,100
I might also be inclined

705
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,740
to make a significant donation
to your new library...

706
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,965
if my sons were using it.

707
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,360
Well, that would...

708
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,620
be a different situation
now, wouldn't it?

709
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Can I pay you in crack?

710
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,420
I'm just kidding with you.

711
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,560
Oh.

712
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,080
It has to be under ten.

713
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,060
Anything over 10,000 is
automatically reported to the IRS.

714
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,200
I know.
You told me.

715
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,140
I'm gonna keep the engine
going while you're in there.

716
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,360
Relax.

717
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,380
We're making a deposit, Don.
We already robbed the bank.

718
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
That's not even funny.

719
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,820
Honey, you know what?
You gotta lighten up,

720
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,180
or I'm gonna have to have you whacked.

721
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,460
When did you even start
talking like that?

722
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,620
I'm kidding you.

723
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,460
But really, sweetie,

724
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,980
I'm the only person in the
whole world who thought this up.

725
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,380
Why can't you be proud of me?

726
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,900
I have no idea who you are anymore,

727
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,720
but I'm enormously proud of you.

728
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,360
Really?
- Yeah!

729
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,940
No, you are amazing.

730
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,220
Really? Are you proud of me?

731
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,955
Tell me again.
- You are so hot.

732
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,100
Oh, my God.

733
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,380
When was the last time
we did it in a car?

734
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,460
We've never done it in the car.

735
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,740
It'd be so stupid to do it in a car...

736
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,420
'cause we have a house.

737
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,780
Oh, God,
yes, we do.

738
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,940
We have a house.

739
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,980
Let's go do it in our house.

740
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,100
You know what?
- What?

741
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,020
They got a park right behind the bank.

742
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,700
Oh, that is such a good idea! Yes!

743
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,500
Okay, which ones do you want me
to get the cashier's checks for?

744
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,235
Baby, keep that engine running.

745
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,080
Shh.

746
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,680
Thanks.

747
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,840
Next!

748
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,040
Here's to a job well done.

749
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,900
Unbelievable,
terrifying,

750
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,320
and thankfully over.

751
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,735
Well, I think we should keep going.

752
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,700
Oh, no.
Sweetheart, that'd be--

753
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,660
No, that's--that's a bad idea.

754
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,900
Yeah. He's right.
That wasn't part of the deal.

755
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,980
We were supposed to just...

756
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,580
you know, get what we needed and get out.

757
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,560
I think we need more, right?

758
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,600
I could use more.

759
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,320
More wouldn't hurt.

760
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,140
No. See, don't get greedy.

761
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,740
See, that's how people get caught.

762
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,500
Exactly. I think we're
asking for trouble.

763
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,740
Don! You've worked your ass
off for 30 years and for what?

764
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,940
So you can see your wife
become a janitor?

765
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,980
And Nina?

766
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,580
You've spent years standing in one spot

767
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,860
throwing money into a shredder

768
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,300
so your boys could have a better life,

769
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,540
and were they one bit
closer to their dream?

770
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,140
Jackie.

771
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,740
There must be something
that you've always

772
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,300
wanted to do with your life.

773
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,960
Yes. I wanna see Brazil
and Czechoslovakia

774
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,700
and India--

775
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,980
Actually, there is no Czechoslovakia.

776
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,760
What?

777
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,460
It's--it's either the Czech
Republic now or Slovakia.

778
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,720
Since when?

779
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,420
1992.

780
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,800
India's still there,
right?

781
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,320
Yes. Yes.
Absolutely.

782
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,300
I wanna see those places for myself.
- Yeah.

783
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,420
And I don't care where we go

784
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,220
just as long as I don't have
to carry any more dead cows.

785
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,620
What's that?

786
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,180
Bob works for Allen
Brothers Meat Packing.

787
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,640
Oh. Oh.
- There you go.

788
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,260
Don.
- What?

789
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,180
Is it wrong? Is it really, really,
really terrible to want security?

790
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,360
Long-term financial security?

791
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,740
How about long-term maximum security?

792
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,260
Because that's where we're
headed if we keep doing this.

793
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,940
Never having to worry again

794
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,580
about sickness, old age, the real
estate market, corporate fallout,

795
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,580
your kids in college,

796
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,980
and a master bath with a walk-in closet.

797
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,260
What?

798
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,860
You almost sounded rational
there for a minute.

799
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,020
A walk-in closet?

800
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,720
We can't spend that money.

801
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,260
I'm sorry.
What?

802
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,580
You know how people get busted?

803
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,240
They brag and they flash.

804
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,380
You don't think it will
draw a little attention?

805
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,820
Three girls from the Fed start
spending money they can't explain?

806
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,580
I mean, if we're gonna do this,

807
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,260
no big-ticket purchases,

808
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,380
no lifestyle changes.

809
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,960
We just go slow and be smart.

810
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,300
Oh, man.

811
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,900
I hate being smart.

812
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,320
When it's enough,

813
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,060
we all move somewhere where nobody knows

814
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,100
we're not supposed to have
that kind of money.

815
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,500
Look, Nina, I understand that
you don't want to spend the money,

816
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,180
and you don't really want sex--

817
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,980
Wait a minute!

818
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,580
I want to have sex.
I want to have sex.

819
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,740
Actually, if you can
come back in a minute.

820
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,700
It's been seven years.

821
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,740
I want it all day and all night.

822
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,260
But while we're living in the real world,

823
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,020
if we're gonna do this, we're
gonna do it right or not at all.

824
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,140
You don't seem to understand.

825
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,840
This is my plan.

826
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,520
Okay. So go do your plan!

827
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,240
Oops. You can't, can you?

828
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,900
Not by yourself.
You can't tell me what to do.

829
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,660
Would you stop fighting?

830
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,000
My way or no way at all.

831
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,900
Okay.

832
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,860
Could I try this one on?

833
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,440
Of course.

834
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,060
Oh, my God.

835
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,020
How much?

836
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,400
62,000.

837
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,380
That's a lot.
Not Really.

838
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,480
You pay for quality.

839
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,740
What?
- You're spending the money.

840
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,780
What are you talking about?

841
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,900
Of course I'm not spending the money.

842
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,260
No?
- No.

843
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,260
What's this?

844
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,700
Uh--

845
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,260
Nina, it's nothing.
That's not even real.

846
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,580
It's not?
- No.

847
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,020
Wow.
- Wait! Hey!

848
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,500
Good!
- No! Wait!

849
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,940
Nina!

850
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,040
That's mine, Nina!

851
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,520
Okay! That was hostile.

852
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,720
Don't spend the money.

853
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,720
Oh!

854
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,780
Sorry I'm late.

855
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,980
Where have you been?

856
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,300
It's 33-40. Here.

857
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,020
No! Don't!

858
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,200
Oh!

859
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,420
Oh, shit!

860
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,040
What?
- The key!

861
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,940
Oh, shit!

862
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:03,900
Oh! Oh!

863
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,060
Okay, where's the spare?

864
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,300
It's in the drain.

865
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,500
You didn't get Jackie's key?

866
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,580
I already did the first floor.
I can't go back up.

867
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,340
Do you have Jackie's cell number?

868
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,100
No, I never put it in my phone.

869
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,420
I didn't want anything to tie her to me.

870
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,180
Oh, God!
Come on!

871
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,060
Look, I gotta go.
My break is over.

872
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,815
Okay, go, go, go.
I'll figure something out.

873
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,240
All right, okay.
Just calm down.

874
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,440
Um, I'll think of something here.

875
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,380
I'll call you right back.

876
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,605
Okay, bye-bye.
Oh, my God!

877
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,080
Five minutes.
Jesus, God.

878
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,740
Hey! Hey, what the hell
are you doing out here?

879
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,100
You're not on break time.

880
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,300
He's got an important call to make.

881
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,500
You work here?
Put the phone away.

882
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,100
Make the call.
Make the call.

883
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,060
You do and you're fired.

884
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,500
Hey, listen you know something, fathead?

885
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,420
Why don't you just put
the damn stopwatch down, huh?

886
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,340
This is a family emergency here.

887
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,260
Look around you!
These are people!

888
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,660
You know, if you fire this man,

889
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,100
each one of these guys is
gonna walk off this dock.

890
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,420
Right, fellas?

891
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,980
Fellas?

892
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,900
You're on your own, Spartacus.
- Nope.

893
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
They cut benefits, man.

894
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,020
Hey, baby.

895
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,940
Hey, doll face.

896
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,040
Prick.

897
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,040
Don. Don. Don.

898
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,425
What in the hell is that
woman doing in there?

899
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,860
Oh, that's not it.

900
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,960
Shit!

901
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,600
No!

902
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,060
Bob, no.

903
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,580
No, I can't go down there.

904
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,845
I can't go down there,
not until sorting finishes.

905
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,660
You all right?

906
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,480
Huh?
- You okay?

907
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,280
Yeah. Just, you know,
carpal tunnel.

908
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,405
Messes with me sometimes.

909
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,745
Fantastic. Yes.
All right. I love you.

910
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,320
Oh! Oh, my--

911
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,680
Mrs. Cardigan.
- Mr. Glover.

912
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,360
You spend an unusual amount
of time in this bathroom.

913
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,480
Everyone...

914
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,480
everywhere...

915
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,500
every minute.

916
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,340
Yeah.

917
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,180
Uh...

918
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,980
are you watching when
everybody goes everywhere?

919
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,040
I really hope so because...

920
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,260
maybe you can tell me

921
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,300
why they can't use the facility

922
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,540
in such a way as to keep
everything in the facility?

923
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,780
I'm a college-educated woman,

924
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,740
and I really don't
understand the physics.

925
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,980
Maybe--maybe you can
see how they even manage

926
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,020
to get what they get where they get it!

927
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,060
You know what we can do?

928
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,500
You and I could hang out.

929
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,660
You can get on the floor
like I do every day

930
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,860
and make a report!

931
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,980
How about that, Mr. Glover?
Huh? Do you like that idea?

932
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,860
What about that?
- Carry on!

933
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,960
Oh, my God.

934
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,300
Okay.
Let's go.

935
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,400
Think fast.

936
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,380
Hi!

937
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,480
Ooh!
Watch out.

938
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,540
What?

939
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,620
What?

940
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,140
I heard that.

941
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,220
You heard what?

942
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,720
I am married, asshole.

943
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,660
I ought to report you.

944
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,780
What the hell did you say to her, man?

945
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,660
Nothing.

946
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,760
Maybe she reads minds.

947
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,700
You need a hand with that?

948
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,660
No. No, no, no,
It's just fine.

949
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,260
Sometimes with these new
ones, you gotta wiggle them.

950
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,020
No, no, no.
Let me help you. I got it.

951
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,260
Your carpal tunnel and everything.

952
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,360
Oh!

953
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,740
Oh!

954
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,420
Hey!

955
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,900
Seriously, guys!
Grow up, okay!

956
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,230
I'm not your personal maid, all right?

957
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,520
Oh, yes!

958
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,260
Hi.

959
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,360
Slow it down.

960
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,180
Man!

961
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,860
This thing's really stuck.

962
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,960
Security.

963
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,670
I'll be right back.
One second.

964
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,620
Oh! Whose your pick for the playoffs?

965
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,260
What playoffs?

966
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,760
Oh!

967
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,380
Oh, my God.
I thought there were playoffs.

968
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,500
Oh, man.

969
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,600
Oh, my God.

970
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,180
Got it.

971
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,280
Great.

972
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,720
Told you.

973
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,420
Yeah?

974
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,660
Oh, thank God.

975
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,500
They're okay.

976
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,800
Oh, sweetheart.

977
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,360
Oh, yeah!

978
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,420
Oh, God!

979
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,520
Wow.

980
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,605
I'm sorry about your job.

981
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,640
I hated my job.

982
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,015
I used to think I did, too.

983
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,160
We need to talk.

984
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,140
Look, Barry, I know you're
probably a really nice guy and all,

985
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,860
and I don't want to make you feel badly,

986
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,295
but I'm really not in a
place in my life right now--

987
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,860
Unless you have half a dozen
very hard, rectangular breasts,

988
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,400
we need to talk.

989
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,400
Are you ought of your mind?

990
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,500
Look, if you're gonna bust me, bust me.

991
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,840
I don't need a lecture.

992
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,260
Who else is it?

993
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,900
The trash woman.
Who else?

994
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,740
I can't tell you that.

995
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,240
Tell them it's over.

996
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,020
What does he mean it's over?

997
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,060
Does it mean he turns
us in and we go to prison?

998
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,460
It's over, and nobody says anything?

999
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,700
We walk away it's over?

1000
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,380
I don't know. I'm just
telling you what he said.

1001
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,460
That's kinda like a major difference.

1002
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,900
Planning my weekend
or planning my bail hearing.

1003
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,580
Okay, okay.
Please stop fighting.

1004
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,740
Now now, not here.

1005
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,020
I think it meant walk away.

1006
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,180
Yeah, because?

1007
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,405
Because we're still here.

1008
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,300
Wow.

1009
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,220
And he...
he likes me.

1010
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,320
Hmm?

1011
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,820
He does like you,
doesn't he?

1012
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,560
A lot.

1013
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,360
Oh, no.
No. Uh-uh!

1014
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,060
That would be brilliant, Nina.
- No!

1015
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,740
If you guys got together,

1016
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,180
and then he was on our team, and then...

1017
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,660
we would be foolproof.

1018
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,940
So what are you saying?

1019
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,020
Do you know what it is when
somebody trades sex for money?

1020
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:32,980
Advertising.

1021
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,080
Public service?

1022
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,100
A good percentage of marriages.

1023
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,280
What is with you people?

1024
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,480
Now these are on me.

1025
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,060
Look, we got a good thing going here.

1026
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,940
And if getting Barry on our side

1027
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,700
is the only way we can keep going,

1028
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,140
I don't think it's asking too much
for you to take one for the team.

1029
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,600
Right.
I mean...

1030
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,920
besides, he's a total babe.

1031
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,340
And you know, honey,
we would do this for you.

1032
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,580
We would do this for you.
- Right.

1033
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,260
Except we happen to be married.

1034
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,340
And of course,
guess what?

1035
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,020
P.S., he doesn't even want us.

1036
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,300
He might not even want me.

1037
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,360
Oh, yeah, right.
Okay.

1038
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,740
Wake up!

1039
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,220
He's, like, all over you all the time.

1040
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,720
Nina,

1041
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,780
are you worried because
it's been so long?

1042
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:27,200
No, Nina, it's just like
riding a bicycle...upside down.

1043
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,420
Okay, look, I still know
how to do it, okay?

1044
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,900
I'm good, I promise you.

1045
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,100
I'm good in that department, all right?

1046
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,000
I'm just-- No.

1047
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,300
I'm worried about how
I'll feel in the morning.

1048
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,640
Sore.

1049
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,820
Rich.

1050
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,920
Why don't we just cut him in?

1051
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,900
All right.
Whatever works.

1052
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Absolutely.

1053
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,660
But seven years is a
really long time, Nina.

1054
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:58,280
Let's just leave it that I decide
what I think is right, okay?

1055
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,660
Just get his address for me.

1056
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,440
Okay.

1057
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,140
All right.
Just breathe.

1058
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,620
Just like riding a bike, Nina.

1059
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,760
Just like riding a bike.

1060
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,780
Okay.

1061
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,960
You like riding a bike.

1062
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,420
You ain't rode a bike in a while,

1063
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,520
but it's gonna be okay.

1064
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,540
Hi.
Hi.

1065
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,640
Hi there.

1066
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,460
Wow.

1067
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,040
Um...

1068
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,400
you mind if I come in?

1069
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,980
It's--it's kinda late.

1070
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,780
Um, maybe we could--

1071
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,960
Barry, who is it?

1072
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,980
I'm sorry. I didn't know about your mom.

1073
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,060
She needs someone to take care of her.

1074
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,400
Um, maybe we could...

1075
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,180
go out somewhere sometime.

1076
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,360
Why?

1077
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,360
Why?

1078
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,780
Cards on the table, huh?

1079
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,880
Don't you think?

1080
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,400
What happened to us

1081
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,960
is we found a way to get what we wanted.

1082
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,420
I mean, have you ever thought about it?

1083
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,060
What if you could have what you wanted?

1084
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,240
I think about it all the time.

1085
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,200
So what do you want?

1086
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,480
Wow.

1087
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,320
I'm so sorry.

1088
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,020
What the hell is the matter with you?

1089
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,060
I--I beg your pardon?

1090
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,620
Are you demented?
That is a fantastic woman.

1091
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,580
I know.

1092
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,300
Well? Are you afraid of her?
- No.

1093
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,820
I'm a little afraid of you at the moment.

1094
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,660
I don't think you're gay.

1095
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,060
Thank you.

1096
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,980
Yeah, so you get the girl,
you get the money.

1097
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,375
So what's the problem, huh?

1098
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,020
Okay. He'll join up.
He wants a full share.

1099
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,780
He just doesn't want sex
with you to be part of the deal.

1100
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,540
You're kidding.

1101
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,260
No.

1102
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,940
It's possible I'm gonna have a stroke,

1103
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,060
and they're gonna find
the words 'I told you so'

1104
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,580
blocking the blood to my brain.

1105
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,740
He says you're worth more than that.

1106
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,940
He said that?

1107
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,040
Yes.

1108
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,955
Oh, he sounds like a great guy.

1109
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,100
Yeah.

1110
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,340
You should just tell him
that you really want to.

1111
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,660
Now?

1112
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,260
Yeah.

1113
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,720
He probably thinks I'm--

1114
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,460
I told Prince Charming I'm a whore.

1115
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,060
He didn't say that.

1116
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,660
I told him I'm a whore.

1117
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,220
No, no, no. Come on.
Nina, he didn't say that.

1118
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,940
Don't get neurotic. I mean, really.
- Yeah.

1119
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,860
Okay, forget about it.
Okay, forget it.

1120
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,920
All right?
We're back in business.

1121
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,140
There's a random search on Thursday.

1122
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,520
So Friday, yeah?

1123
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,580
Works for me.

1124
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,620
Okay, is that it, Friday?

1125
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,015
Friday's good, right?
- Yes.

1126
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,380
This one's yours, right?

1127
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,480
Yeah, thank you.

1128
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,180
Look, I really owe you an apology.

1129
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,540
You did what you thought you had to.

1130
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,740
No.

1131
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,320
I'm not...like that.

1132
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,500
And I know you probably think that--

1133
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,900
Maybe you got the wrong message here.

1134
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,560
I never said I didn't want you.

1135
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,365
I just didn't want you like that.

1136
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,040
Well, look,
maybe we could just...

1137
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,040
start from scratch.

1138
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,900
Aah!
Oh, my God!

1139
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,180
Oh!

1140
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,460
Sorry.
- Excuse us.

1141
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,060
No, no, that's fine.
I'm actually very sorry.

1142
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,620
We'll be out in a minute.

1143
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,940
No, no, please,
take your time.

1144
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,980
Are you kidding me?
Everything's great.

1145
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:27,340
Yeah, we got federal crimes,
a house full of loot,

1146
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,260
and now people having sex in our closet.

1147
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,980
I know.

1148
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,840
Oh, come on, Bridget.

1149
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,900
Are you really fine with all this?

1150
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,100
Well, actually, I'm sort of hoping
she'll finally lighten up a bit

1151
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,940
and let us start spending
some of this money.

1152
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,140
What?

1153
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,555
I don't know.
Maybe I just wanted a job.

1154
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,860
What?

1155
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,680
Actually, I thought I was losing her.

1156
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,420
And all I could think of doing

1157
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:00,000
was try to make her need me again.

1158
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,600
All right, everyone,
listen up.

1159
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,380
What you need is a boyfriend.

1160
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,420
Hold up.
- Excuse me?

1161
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,800
What you need is to not--

1162
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,820
A rich one.

1163
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,060
Someone who's out of town a lot,

1164
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,940
gets you gifts,

1165
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,180
pays for your kids' tuition
at a fancy private school.

1166
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,280
And what you need is a job.

1167
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,780
Hey, man,
I'm looking, all right?

1168
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,620
Day trading, all right?
On-line.

1169
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,100
If anybody asks, you're
into short-term futures.

1170
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,700
If somebody wants a tip

1171
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,700
just tell them the market's
way too volatile.

1172
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,340
Can you write that down?

1173
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,260
Yes.

1174
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,820
Barry,

1175
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,900
your mom's gonna get
a big insurance settlement.

1176
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,740
Huge.

1177
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,420
Of course I will be doing

1178
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,780
freelance corporate
consulting out of our house,

1179
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,980
which we will have to remodel.

1180
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,080
Okay.
There you are.

1181
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,860
We all have jobs we need to do

1182
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,820
or the appearance thereof.

1183
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,920
Isn't he just great?

1184
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:55,120
Hot damn. We're finally organized crime.

1185
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:10,585
It's kinda hard to think
of ourselves as bank robbers.

1186
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,340
It got be kinda like a job.

1187
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,440
Hmm.

1188
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,940
Of course we had problems,
you know?

1189
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,720
Like where to put it all.

1190
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,120
We had it down to a science.

1191
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,360
The perfect money machine.

1192
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,800
Aw.

1193
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,740
Money...
...can buy you...

1194
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,060
happiness.

1195
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,305
Don't let anybody tell you different.

1196
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,580
What is Marjorie
gonna say about that, huh?

1197
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,740
Oh!

1198
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,000
I am so happy for you!

1199
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,380
Are you?
Everything is wonderful.

1200
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,300
Thank you.
Bridget, the good stuff.

1201
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,900
The good stuff,
thank you.

1202
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,635
The good stuff!
You're so funny!

1203
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,720
Hi, Bridget.
- Hi. Hello.

1204
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,300
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

1205
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,960
Oh, hi!

1206
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,480
Oh, how are you?

1207
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,360
Hey.
- Huh?

1208
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,760
You having fun?
- Yeah.

1209
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,100
You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

1210
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,220
Tom Gaffney just offered me a job.

1211
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,870
Senior VP, head of a division.

1212
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,220
They're impressed by how well
I've been doing as a consultant.

1213
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,780
Take it, Don.

1214
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,420
You think?
- Yeah.

1215
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,540
Is it weird wanting to sit in an
office all day when you don't have to?

1216
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,140
You're a manager.
You need something to manage.

1217
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,780
It's a pay cut.

1218
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,540
We're gonna have to pretend
to be living on less.

1219
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,740
Yeah, I know.

1220
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,540
You know,
you could quit.

1221
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,700
Seriously.

1222
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,300
I mean, we could survive

1223
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,900
being upper middle class
for a while, right?

1224
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,180
Honey, I don't know.

1225
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,660
I hate cleaning toilets,
but the money is so good.

1226
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,760
Well, think about it.

1227
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,800
Do you know that guy?

1228
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,720
No. Why?

1229
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,820
I don't know.

1230
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,920
Oh, my God!

1231
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,160
Oh! This is so exciting!

1232
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,120
Oh, my God!
- Thank you.

1233
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:11,320
Thanks.
- Ring, ring, ring!

1234
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,980
Good for you guys.

1235
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,600
Oh, that's great.

1236
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,600
Yes, girl! Uh-huh!

1237
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,340
Green-level employees,

1238
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,380
like this young lady here,

1239
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,800
are not allowed in red-level areas.

1240
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,760
Transitions to red-badge areas

1241
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:32,010
are modeled after Federal
maximum security prisons.

1242
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,905
red IDs to ascend beyond the cameras.

1243
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,220
It was that guy...

1244
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,720
showing up.

1245
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,180
The thing about
a perfect machine, though,

1246
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:49,040
is you drop in one loose screw...

1247
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,540
Bam!

1248
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,660
Oh! Jesus!

1249
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,660
I just came from the loading dock.

1250
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,700
I was dropping off a cart,

1251
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:55,660
when all of a sudden,

1252
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,900
Glover comes out of nowhere--

1253
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,260
Aah!
- Aah!

1254
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,360
Shh!
- Quiet!

1255
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,780
Just be quiet.
Just be quiet.

1256
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,980
Okay.

1257
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,680
What did you mean,
'We're busted'?

1258
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,165
This guy was looking
at me very strangely.

1259
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,620
I take my feelings seriously.

1260
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,220
Okay, Jackie, but let's
try not to panic, okay?

1261
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,460
Yeah, yeah. You said you
never saw him before, right?

1262
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,900
You don't know why he could be here.

1263
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,540
It could be nothing.

1264
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,380
It is not nothing.

1265
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,820
All right, we're just going
to try and find out, all right?

1266
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,920
Okay?

1267
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,480
All right.

1268
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,840
Okay.

1269
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:55,380
Ah! Service employees who
need access to red-level areas

1270
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,460
are given yellow I.D. badges.

1271
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,780
A yellow badge is only
allowed in secure areas

1272
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,320
under red-level supervision.

1273
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,940
Yellow badge employees are
given a rigorous screening

1274
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,740
in national databanks

1275
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,700
for criminal and psychiatric history.

1276
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,435
It turns out they're all crazy.

1277
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,880
That's a joke.

1278
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,160
Whoa, whoa.

1279
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,340
Aah!

1280
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,440
Whoopsie!

1281
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,520
Oh, I think we're all safe
in this room, don't you?

1282
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,180
Uh-huh.

1283
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,380
Let's go right. Moving on.

1284
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:39,080
Step right this way.

1285
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,680
So as you can see,

1286
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,780
there is simply no opportunity for theft,

1287
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,060
which is why there's never been a theft

1288
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,860
of even a single note at this facility

1289
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,020
and there never will be.

1290
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,120
Right.

1291
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,720
Look,

1292
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:00,640
these are not white-collar people.

1293
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,540
They would have to
physically steal the money,

1294
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,060
which I just told you is impossible.

1295
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,580
You're talking about women who...

1296
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:07,420
change trash bags.

1297
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,760
They push carts around,

1298
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,600
drop paper in a hole eight hours a day.

1299
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,940
You got to admit it's
kind of impressive, though.

1300
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,660
Impressive?

1301
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,900
Yeah, I mean, these people
have managed to acquire

1302
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,900
enormous sums of unaccounted for cash,

1303
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,140
and no one can figure out how.

1304
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,540
Isn't that odd? Are you
a little curious about that?

1305
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,420
Yes. So what we need to
do is get the KCPD on them,

1306
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,740
find out what they're up to.

1307
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,080
We have...for months.

1308
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,240
You've been watching them for months...

1309
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,500
and nobody told me?

1310
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,500
Yeah. We believe one of your
staff has been compromised.

1311
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,940
We had to assume the entire
security squad was corrupt.

1312
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,980
How the hell dare you come
in here slinging allegations

1313
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,200
when you have nothing?

1314
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,580
No evidence.

1315
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,420
They could have gotten this
money any number of ways.

1316
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,420
They--they could be involved
with drugs, computer crime?

1317
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,020
Well, they could have gotten
it turning in cans for deposit,

1318
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,580
but they work at a bank.

1319
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,020
Actually, your bank.

1320
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,620
You listen to me.

1321
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,660
I run the tightest lockdown
this side of Fort Knox!

1322
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,540
And until you can prove otherwise,

1323
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,940
you get your glorified
paper-pushing ass out of here

1324
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,525
and let some real men do their damn jobs!

1325
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,500
You know, I hope for
your sake you're right,

1326
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,300
and I hope this place is as airtight
as you seem to wanna believe it is,

1327
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,700
and I hope that you're
not a part of a conspiracy

1328
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,140
to steal from the Federal Government,

1329
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,500
because that would be a crime

1330
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,300
punishable to the fullest
extent of the law.

1331
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,865
You will be held accountable.

1332
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,820
He's a Federal Bank examiner.

1333
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,720
Mindy Arbogast called of course.

1334
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,260
He's talking to all of our neighbors.

1335
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,360
What was he asking?

1336
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,100
How we make our money.
What I do for a living.

1337
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,340
Are you sure it's
the same guy from the party?

1338
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,660
Yes. Yes, I am sure it's
the guy from the party.

1339
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,020
All right.
What we need to do

1340
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,420
is we need to talk to a lawyer.

1341
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,420
We'll give ourselves up.

1342
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,020
We are not going to do that. Mm-mmm.

1343
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,580
No. No, no, honey,
listen to me.

1344
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,580
Look, we still have most
of the money, right?

1345
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,740
So we'll give it back,

1346
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,660
and we'll negotiate some kind of,

1347
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,940
you know,
suspended sentences

1348
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,220
or something like that,
all right?

1349
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,820
Don, I can't do that.
We cannot do that.

1350
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,540
Bridget, please.
Look...

1351
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,140
We have so few cards to play.

1352
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:17,160
Honey, it's not shoplifting.

1353
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,460
It's a federal crime.

1354
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,680
Don! We can't turn
ourselves in because...

1355
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,740
they're gonna take Nina's kids away.

1356
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,920
And, uh...

1357
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,920
she'd kill me.

1358
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,040
No. Bob...

1359
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,940
it is not a surveillance blimp.

1360
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,780
Don?

1361
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,180
Don't worry.
I'll call you right back.

1362
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,280
I'm going to jail.

1363
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,240
No. No.
No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

1364
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,100
I am telling you
if they had any evidence,

1365
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,900
they would have arrested us already,

1366
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,420
and they're just fishing.

1367
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,420
So I'm saying we were careful, correct?

1368
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,540
Everybody spent within
the cover stories, right?

1369
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,060
Do investments count as spending?

1370
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,780
What investments?

1371
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,120
You said be a day trader.

1372
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,480
No, we didn't.
Oh, boy!

1373
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:22,020
We said pretend to be a day trader.
- Yeah.

1374
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,160
Well, I was...

1375
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,900
you know, getting into character, right?

1376
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,980
And I set up this portfolio.

1377
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,700
The Bob Fund.

1378
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,780
Oh, good God!
- And, uh...

1379
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,080
I am making 17%.

1380
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,820
Did you ever invest amounts
greater than $10,000 at one time?

1381
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,420
Oh, hell yeah!
- You did.

1382
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,380
Like big mondo chunks, man!

1383
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,260
Yeah, totally!

1384
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,860
I'm looking to make
the large green, hombre.

1385
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,820
You think I like thinking
of my wife on her feet

1386
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,510
from nine to five every day
ripping off the government?

1387
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,520
This is bad, right?

1388
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,340
Transactions over $10,000

1389
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,980
are automatically reported to the IRS!

1390
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,300
How many times do I have to say that?

1391
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,940
Well, I didn't-- I didn't know that.

1392
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:08,360
Look, you cannot blame me
for things I didn't know.

1393
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:09,220
That would not be fair.

1394
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,940
All right, look,

1395
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,060
it doesn't prove one thing.

1396
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,380
They can't arrest us without evidence.

1397
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,860
What about the piles of
cash in our houses?

1398
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,740
I mean, you don't think that
might be a little problem?

1399
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,860
Uh, well--

1400
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,220
We're gonna have to
get rid of it...tonight.

1401
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,600
No. We'll take it with us.

1402
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,820
We'll run. We'll get new identities.

1403
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,980
Good.
- No. Shut up, will you?

1404
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:29,860
What do you mean run?
To where?

1405
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:30,940
What so we tell our kids?

1406
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,260
Like they ever call us?

1407
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,180
It's too late.
- They're already watching us.

1408
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,425
There was blimp over our house.
- Bob!

1409
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,100
Come on.

1410
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,960
Bridget, please.

1411
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,260
We worked so hard.

1412
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,200
And that's it?

1413
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,200
Whew!

1414
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,740
We'll be all right.
We'll be all right.

1415
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,180
She'll--she'll do it...
really.

1416
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,520
Did you say 17%?

1417
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,940
17%.

1418
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,360
My God,
that's unbelievable.

1419
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,840
What, are you mad, babe?

1420
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,200
This is crazy.

1421
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,900
Listen, Nina,

1422
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,560
I know cops from work,

1423
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,000
how they do things.

1424
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,540
What happens when they
don't have enough evidence

1425
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,300
is they try and get one of us
to roll over against the other,

1426
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,520
testify.

1427
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,080
The thing is they only need one.

1428
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,260
Whoever rolls over first gets the deal.

1429
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,580
First-time offender,
single mom,

1430
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,620
they might deal you down to
probation if you roll now, alone.

1431
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,120
I can't-- I can't do that.

1432
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,300
We're all grownups here.

1433
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,320
We did what we did.

1434
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:44,200
The boys...

1435
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,120
you should know how it works.

1436
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,560
We could do it, you know.

1437
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,560
Get away.

1438
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,820
I don't want to.

1439
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:01,080
No?

1440
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,460
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I--

1441
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,740
I can't live with it just hanging
over us the rest of our life.

1442
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,220
I'm not sorry we did it,

1443
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,360
but I really...

1444
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,505
I'd really like this part to be over.

1445
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,640
Hang on.

1446
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,220
Yeah, we are in a police state.

1447
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,460
No, we're not in a police state.

1448
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,940
Yeah, we are.
It's like 1989.

1449
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,560
What?

1450
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,540
No!
Oh, no!

1451
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,640
God, what an idiot.

1452
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,000
Honey, I need more.

1453
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,120
Mom?

1454
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,860
Okay.

1455
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,780
Shh. Quiet.
Shh. Rufus.

1456
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,880
Good Rufus.

1457
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,530
Okay. They're on the move.

1458
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,600
Wow.

1459
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,920
Beautiful, doll.

1460
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,180
Uh-oh.

1461
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,425
This is the police.
Stop your vehicle.

1462
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,320
stop your vehicle.

1463
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,660
Exit with your hands above your head.

1464
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,225
Now we're under surveillance.

1465
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,160
Freeze!
KCPD!

1466
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,305
Keep your hands where we can see 'em!

1467
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,480
Freeze!
KCPD! Drop it!

1468
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,680
Drop it!

1469
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,360
Hold it!
Don't you move!

1470
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,020
Mom, what's going on?

1471
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,500
Stay in the house, boys.
Mom?

1472
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,480
We're going in.
You stay put.

1473
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,800
Wow.
Nice house.

1474
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,800
Kansas City Police!

1475
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,240
Up here.

1476
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,460
Hi.

1477
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,600
Um...

1478
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,830
I don't suppose anyone's seen my wife.

1479
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,960
No?

1480
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,340
Okay...

1481
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,320
Miss...Capone.

1482
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,260
King room,
no smoking.

1483
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,100
You'll be putting this on which card?

1484
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,780
I'm paying in cash.

1485
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,535
We still need a credit
card for incidentals.

1486
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,180
There won't be any incidents,

1487
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,280
will there?

1488
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,520
No, ma'am.

1489
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,600
Room 412.

1490
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,600
Right through there.

1491
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,820
You need to help yourself here.

1492
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,780
Yeah, well, I want to see a lawyer.

1493
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:43,080
Donde my abogato.

1494
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,040
Just tell us how they did it.

1495
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,800
Did you hear me?

1496
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,880
Lawyer.

1497
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,360
L-a-y...

1498
01:22:56,360 --> 01:23:00,000
w...e...r.

1499
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,620
She left you, man.

1500
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:07,120
Your wife ditched you.

1501
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,925
What are you gonna do about that?

1502
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,600
Wish her well?

1503
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,860
Your children are at
the Child Welfare offices.

1504
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,020
When you're indicted,

1505
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,380
we'll put them into
the foster care system.

1506
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,780
Now, the district attorney can help you

1507
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,880
if you help him.

1508
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,740
Hi.

1509
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,840
Hey.

1510
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:35,740
How much?

1511
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,540
How much what?

1512
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,040
How much did you take?

1513
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,260
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

1514
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,100
Why? How much do you think I took?

1515
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,940
We have no idea.

1516
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,700
Really?
That's right.

1517
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,620
You don't know?
- Nope.

1518
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,200
Oh. Good.

1519
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,520
You can't arrest me.

1520
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:01,160
You're a bank examiner.

1521
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,820
That's right.
- Right.

1522
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,260
Well, you've done your homework.

1523
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,540
What do you want?

1524
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,260
I guess I wanna know
what makes someone like you

1525
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,660
decide to do something like this?

1526
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,880
Well, I have a theory.
- Mm-hmm.

1527
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,400
Crime is contagious.

1528
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,820
Oh, brother.

1529
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:24,240
He is a piece of work.

1530
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:26,620
Oh, yeah.
Look in the camera.

1531
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,380
Greetings, Earthlings.

1532
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:33,240
You know those two
amazing women-- amazing--

1533
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,420
that they just arrested,

1534
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:38,600
and--and their families and my husband?

1535
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,820
They never really had a shot.

1536
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,580
I mean, they kept trying,
and they did their best,

1537
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,500
but what did they really get out of it?

1538
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,235
A gigantic untraceable fortune.

1539
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,720
Prove it.

1540
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,560
Hello?

1541
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,300
I've been told you want a deal.

1542
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,400
Yes.

1543
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,060
It should have been a little faster.

1544
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,580
Who?

1545
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,680
The girl.

1546
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:39,480
Kind of a hinky plea bargain.

1547
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:43,160
She says the deal is you get the walk.

1548
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,760
Full immunity.

1549
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,100
She tells us everything

1550
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,175
if you get to go home to your kids.

1551
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,400
Go figure people.

1552
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,420
What do you want?
Bridget, I didn't--

1553
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,660
I need a lawyer.

1554
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,650
I don't do criminal work, Bridget.

1555
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:17,960
You take that out of
this house this minute.

1556
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,020
You know, not everybody is like you.

1557
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,420
Some of us have morals and standards--

1558
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,520
Shut up, Mindy!

1559
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,840
I'm a tax attorney.

1560
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,320
I know that.

1561
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,180
Excuse me.

1562
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,620
What's going on here?

1563
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:32,700
Was she represented?

1564
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,420
Deal's done.

1565
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,380
I am this woman's attorney.

1566
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,860
You're what?

1567
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:38,980
The deal wasn't with her.

1568
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,460
It was with one of the other suspects.

1569
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,020
I represent them all.

1570
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,690
And I need to confer
with my clients...now.

1571
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,200
Wait right here.

1572
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,460
You have no case against my clients.

1573
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,800
We have a confession.

1574
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,260
She'll recant.

1575
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,940
They all will.

1576
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,500
What about the money,
the cars, the houses?

1577
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,180
There's no law against having money.

1578
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,180
Can you prove they stole it?

1579
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,320
Of course they stole it.

1580
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,780
Did they?

1581
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,660
These women robbed
your bank for three years

1582
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,180
without setting off a single alarm?

1583
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,085
Is that what happened,
Mr. Glover?

1584
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,380
According to our records,

1585
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,220
all currency that was
due to be destroyed...

1586
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,320
was destroyed.

1587
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,480
The Fed is a totally secure institution.

1588
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,060
We watch everyone...

1589
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,980
everywhere...

1590
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,080
every minute.

1591
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,720
It is impossible to remove
currency from our system.

1592
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:06,140
There's no evidence the crime
was even committed.

1593
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,580
You should never have arrested them.

1594
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,600
Not so fast,
counselor.

1595
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,700
IRS.

1596
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,480
Ever hear of U.S. Code Section 7201?

1597
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,120
Yeah.

1598
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,700
Well, Bridget,
you were right.

1599
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:30,860
You didn't pay taxes.

1600
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,420
On stolen money?

1601
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,840
I didn't hear that.

1602
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:38,560
The IRS is offering what I consider...

1603
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,220
a good deal.

1604
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,240
No jail time.

1605
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,320
Oh! Oh, thank you!

1606
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,700
But the fines and the penalties
will wipe you out.

1607
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,700
You can walk away from this if...

1608
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,080
you walk empty-handed.

1609
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,780
I didn't think we'd
be coming out of there.

1610
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,520
Christ, Arbogast,
he is so good.

1611
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,520
I had no idea.

1612
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:31,820
You didn't really think that I
would leave you in there, did you?

1613
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,920
Yeah.

1614
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:38,000
One hell of a ride, huh?

1615
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,080
Yeah.

1616
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,080
Hell of a ride.

1617
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,680
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1618
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,800
Bye, Nina.
Barry.

1619
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,280
Come on, boys.

1620
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,320
Hey, Junior.
- Hey, hey.

1621
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,140
Long time no see.

1622
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,140
I know. The place is looking nice.

1623
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,240
Yes, it is,
isn't it?

1624
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,100
Hey, Bridget.

1625
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,200
Oh!

1626
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,120
Jackie!
- Jackie!

1627
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,340
How you doing, girl?
I've missed you.

1628
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,600
How was the honeymoon?

1629
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,820
Was it?
Yeah, tell.

1630
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:56,000
Two very fine days.

1631
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,620
That's it.

1632
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,780
Oh, and the five of us crammed
up in that tiny apartment.

1633
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,780
Boy, you really got have
a good sense of humor.

1634
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,980
And we got the two incomes, so...

1635
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,220
I can't complain.

1636
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,320
Wow.
- Wow.

1637
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,920
Well, Bob got his job back.
- Okay!

1638
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,500
And I'm waitressing.

1639
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,660
And we figure in five years,

1640
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,060
we're going to South America.

1641
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,180
We're driving all the way to the bottom.

1642
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,280
There you go.

1643
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,595
Junior--
- There you go, ladies.

1644
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:26,940
This one's on the house.

1645
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,340
Like old times.

1646
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,460
No shit.

1647
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,240
We're going back to...

1648
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,240
work?

1649
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:38,200
Bob has access to a lot of beef.

1650
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,340
No. No.

1651
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,220
No.

1652
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,500
Okay.
- Yes, no.

1653
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,860
Okay.

1654
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,700
But we're moving.

1655
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,460
To the Caribbean.

1656
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,820
We're gonna open a little
bed-and-breakfast.

1657
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,380
I'm gonna cook.

1658
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,700
Don's gonna manage it of course.

1659
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,260
We've been talking about this for years.

1660
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:55,940
But we're just kinda waiting

1661
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,080
until it's not..,
so hot.

1662
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,880
Hot?

1663
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:02,740
It's chilly out.

1664
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,460
Yeah.

1665
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,020
Hey, wait. Did you ever hear
that expression 'mad money?'

1666
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,020
My mother used to say,
'Every woman should keep

1667
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,380
a little mad money
tucked away just in case.'

1668
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:14,840
Do you use mad money when you go mad

1669
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,560
or when you get mad?

1670
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:20,680
Why don't you decide for yourself?

1671
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,780
Junior?

1672
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:23,880
Uh-huh!
- Come on.

1673
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:26,320
Watch your step.

1674
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,520
Do you know?
- No.

1675
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:31,460
What are you up to?
Why are we down here?

1676
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:35,470
Relax. You just have to
have a little patience.

1677
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,040
Does this look familiar?

1678
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,160
Oh!

1679
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,140
Holy shit!
- Oh!

1680
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:51,040
Who did it?
- I did! Me!

1681
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,260
Oh, my God!

1682
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:01,440
You sneaky criminal mastermind!

1683
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,440
Oh!
