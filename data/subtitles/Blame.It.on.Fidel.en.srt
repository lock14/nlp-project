Meet local girls from Snapchat on

2
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:54,561
Blame it on Fidel

3
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,924
Why isn't she doing anything?

4
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,676
She doesn't speak French.

5
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,202
Her name is Pilar.
She is Spanish.

6
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:30,485
What's going on here?

7
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,802
Yes?

8
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,877
I'm teaching them
to cut fruit properly,

9
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:36,588
but they're not very gifted.

10
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,632
You're such a lady!

11
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,592
Children, you may leave the table.

12
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,963
Isabelle, forget about them.

13
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,328
Hurry up and make me
some grandchildren!

14
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,087
- There's no rush.
- Of course.

15
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:56,167
You should go kiss your grandpa.
He'd love that.

16
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,795
Isabelle, you look lovely!

17
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,468
You'll see.
You will have your own room.

18
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:10,080
Would you like to go swimming?

19
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,177
You could learn how to play music.

20
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:15,456
We'll go see clowns at the circus.

21
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:17,596
Do you like the circus?
What else do you like?

22
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:22,175
You'll see that in no time
you'll be speaking French.

23
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,532
That comes easy to you.

24
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:26,196
Cat!

25
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:30,651
François, don't!
You'll get me dirty!

26
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:33,003
Leave me alone!

27
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,642
Stop following me around!

28
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,085
Anna, be careful,
or you'll tear that veil!

29
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,817
Give it back to Isabelle.

30
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,270
Why is Dad always
with Pilar and her mom?

31
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:51,025
Don't bother them.

32
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,608
Life is tough
for your aunt and your cousin.

33
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:55,362
Give me a hand.

34
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,827
Was your bridal veil as long?

35
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,092
I had none.

36
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:03,049
We got married at City Hall.

37
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:05,882
You said there was a party there!

38
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:08,617
Just my parents, Mathieu,
and some cousins.

39
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:11,014
That's all?

40
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:13,035
It didn't matter to us.

41
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:15,628
Mathieu and Isabelle love festivities.

42
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:17,384
And it pleases your grandparents.

43
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,230
This is their place now.

44
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,567
They'll live with Granny and Grandpa?

45
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:26,335
Lucky them!

46
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:34,122
Mom, doesn't Isabelle
look like a princess?

47
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,294
You're not playing
with the other kids?

48
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:59,230
No. All they do is run.

49
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,325
If you stay here, I'll tickle you.

50
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,363
Tickle, tickle!

51
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,927
Stop!

52
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,784
Will Pilar and her mom
go back to Spain?

53
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:27,845
Not right now.

54
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,092
They're never going home?

55
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:38,009
There are laws in Spain
against people like Marga or Quino.

56
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:41,140
I'll explain some other time.

57
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,209
But you're a lawyer!
You can help them go home!

58
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,932
It's too complicated now.

59
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:51,356
In Spain, you can't do as you please.

60
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,691
Where will they go?

61
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,449
To our place in Paris.

62
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:57,734
In our home?

63
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,047
Until they find a place, yes.

64
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,857
Will that take long?

65
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:10,384
What is it, my princess?

66
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:15,123
They should just go home.

67
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,343
Anna.

68
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,999
Your uncle Quino died.

69
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:25,960
I had to smuggle them out.

70
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,241
I can't send them back there.

71
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,225
We have to take care of them.

72
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:43,286
If François was in danger,
wouldn't you help him?

73
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,383
Anna.

74
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,966
Don't pretend you don't understand!

75
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,493
She's my sister,

76
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,791
and in these past 10 years,
I never helped her.

77
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:55,075
I did nothing!

78
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:59,059
So we must all take care
of her and Pilar!

79
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,055
You may open your notebooks.

80
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:24,135
What did you get?

81
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:28,814
- And you?
- 9 out of 10!

82
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:37,789
Good morning,
Sister Anne-Marie!

83
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:44,455
See you later,
Sister Genevieve!

84
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:49,002
Take your Bible study notebook, girls.

85
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,861
Anna, homework time!

86
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:09,600
Why leave?
You can live here!

87
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:11,971
There's room for everyone!

88
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,865
I don't know if I can.

89
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,978
I don't know
what I am going to do.

90
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:17,538
I fought for 15 years.

91
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:20,650
15 years of my life.
Always with Quino.

92
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:23,465
Now I have nothing.

93
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:25,732
You could fight from here.

94
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,949
And what about your daughter?

95
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:29,720
You must think
of your daughter now.

96
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:31,911
This life isn't for me.

97
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,261
A family, a house, a job.
That's your choice.

98
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,503
I can't live that way.

99
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,150
But thanks, anyway.

100
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:45,691
- Thank you for...
- What are you doing?

101
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:50,059
Do your homework!
It will be time for your bath soon!

102
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,740
François, stop splashing me!

103
00:09:56,837 --> 00:10:00,864
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Mom.

104
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:04,385
Mom, I got 9 out of 10 on my essay!

105
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,012
In Bible study,
we did Genesis, my favorite!

106
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:08,706
Your favorite what?

107
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,579
Story. How the world began.

108
00:10:10,676 --> 00:00:00,306
You only like stories
about princesses.

109
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:02,240
You only like stories
about princesses.

110
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,933
Get up, François!

111
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,245
Mom, why has Dad quit his job?

112
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:23,533
I hope you didn't bother him.
I said to leave him alone.

113
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:26,242
He needs to think.

114
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:28,466
So, are you going to ask me?

115
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,770
It's the 25th of the month.

116
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,712
Your magazine!

117
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:44,935
I can't find Mom's article!

118
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:49,547
Anna, this is not the time!
Put it away!

119
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,054
Tell us about your essay.

120
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,330
It was about our vacation
in Bordeaux.

121
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:57,931
I wrote about Isabelle
and Mathieu's wedding.

122
00:10:58,015 --> 00:11:01,542
But I didn't write about Uncle Quino.
I didn't know what to say.

123
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:04,553
You did well.
Some things are secret.

124
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,892
Why?

125
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,693
Like having Communists in the family.

126
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,597
- What?
- Communists!

127
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,980
The <i>barbudos!</i>

128
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,078
I had to leave Cuba because of Fidel
and the Communists.

129
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,384
They took everything!
My house, my land, everything!

130
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:16,966
Damn them!

131
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,678
They almost caused a nuclear war!

132
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,540
A nuclear war?

133
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:24,283
Listen, Anna!
I hope your aunt leaves!

134
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:29,335
She'll warp their mind,
like all those dirty reds!

135
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:12,103
Third! You can do better than that!

136
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,522
How do you say <i>patata?</i>

137
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:40,006
Potato.

138
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:41,508
- Potato.
- Very good.

139
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:45,696
If your aunt is Spanish,
then your dad must be Spanish too?

140
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:47,783
Not really.
He never goes there.

141
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:50,376
His parents died when I was little.

142
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:54,090
- But he has an accent.
- Really?

143
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,306
<i>Judias verdes</i> is green beans.

144
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,113
I'd never seen someone
whose dad was dead.

145
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,246
But she seems normal.

146
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,195
Why can't they go home?

147
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:05,741
- They're Communists!
- What's that?

148
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,260
Filomena says
they're red and bearded.

149
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:12,059
But I think they don't fear the Lord,
and they move all the time.

150
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,656
- Really?
- Yes!

151
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:16,218
Pilar doesn't take Bible study
at school.

152
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,873
In Spain, they had to move
all the time!

153
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,372
Soon they're going to move again.

154
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:26,319
They're moving to an apartment.

155
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:30,622
Don't stay there, girls.
Take this to your parents.

156
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:02,877
Why did you invite them?

157
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,068
You're here all day.
We never go out.

158
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,010
Why them?
He's unbearable!

159
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,977
I thought it was a good idea.

160
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:13,057
Anna and Cecile get along well,
and her mother is nice.

161
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,880
No, she's not nice!

162
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:17,070
She's dumb!

163
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:20,616
They're just like the people
we are friends with.

164
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:25,535
You can't stand anything anymore,
locked up in your office all day!

165
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,882
Why won't you go to Spain?

166
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,000
Or do something about Spain?

167
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:33,577
- It's useless.
- Be a lawyer for refugees!

168
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,367
Even here, things are blocked.

169
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,822
Then, leave!

170
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:40,157
Go to Latin America!
Things are happening there.

171
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:42,254
What about you?

172
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:43,983
I'll come along!

173
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:45,761
You'd come?

174
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:48,675
Yes.

175
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,546
And the kids?

176
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:53,605
They'll be fine.

177
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,059
They've spent two weeks alone
with Filomena before.

178
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,018
Children!
Your parents are on the phone!

179
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,013
Hurry!

180
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:11,928
- What time is it there?
- <i>Almost noon.</i>

181
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,705
What presents will you bring back?

182
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,279
<i>Let it be a surprise.</i>
<i>I can't talk for long.</i>

183
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:22,141
<i>On the calendar I left you,</i>
<i>change the last date to November 20.</i>

184
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:24,840
- <i>Big kiss, my love!</i>
- Me too.

185
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,244
<i>Is everything okay, Anna?</i>

186
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:30,303
Dad, why did you change
your return date again?

187
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,830
<i>Things are happening here.</i>
<i>We'll tell you when we're back.</i>

188
00:15:33,924 --> 00:15:35,721
<i>How was it at Marga and Pilar's?</i>

189
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:37,945
I don't know. We didn't go.

190
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,603
<i>You didn't go?</i>
<i>Let me talk to Filomena.</i>

191
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,623
- Give it to me!
- Okay.

192
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,151
Dad, why so long?
When will you be back?

193
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,237
1... 2... 3...

194
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,798
They have changed
their return date three times!

195
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:53,358
They left so that Dad could think.

196
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,513
When they're back,
it will be just like before.

197
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:03,493
Dad says a lot is happening there.
That must mean it's good.

198
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:10,300
So, what else do you do on Sundays
with your parents?

199
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,321
We do tickle, tickle!

200
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:15,438
Then we all take a bath together!

201
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:17,389
All four of you?

202
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:18,695
Naked?

203
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,745
Sure!

204
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:24,330
Well! We've already missed Church.

205
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,216
You'll have your bath alone today.

206
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:30,405
All alone!

207
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,276
<i>People of France,</i>

208
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:55,819
<i>France is widowed.</i>

209
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:59,381
<i>In 1940, he saved our honor.</i>

210
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,444
General De Gaulle has died.

211
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:07,373
<i>In 1944, he led us</i>
<i>to liberation and victory.</i>

212
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:10,520
It's all over.

213
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:48,350
Chile is a rich land,
but it has too many poor people.

214
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,909
The wealth must be shared.

215
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,866
We must intervene in every sector:

216
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,937
Education, healthcare
and land reform.

217
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:59,024
We'll give free milk to every child
under the age of 4 every day.

218
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,145
We'll build 100,000 new houses,
so every family owns one.

219
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:05,427
Here, this is also for you.

220
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,582
It's a <i>momio.</i> A mummy.

221
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:15,601
In Chile, that's how they call those
who are against Allende.

222
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:22,089
We arrived in Chile
as elections were happening,

223
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,950
important presidential elections.

224
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,047
We were in Santiago.

225
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:31,761
It was a strange
and exciting moment.

226
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,159
Allende got elected,
but there were threats of a putsch.

227
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,044
What's a "poontch"?

228
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:42,119
It's when the army
overthrows the President.

229
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,866
They tried, but it didn't work.

230
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:48,213
Allende is now officially President.

231
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:51,810
Are you going to work with him, Dad?

232
00:18:51,939 --> 00:18:54,840
I'll help him
establish ties with France.

233
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:56,459
Are we going to live in Chile?

234
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,713
No, but we must make changes.

235
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:03,316
We must all be united and support
your dad's important work.

236
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,240
How will you get by?

237
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:09,184
- Marie, what will you do?
- Keep writing for <i>Marie Claire.</i>

238
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:11,797
I can pitch them many articles now!

239
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,663
What do we have to change?

240
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:16,039
You said there would be changes.

241
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,087
Don't worry.

242
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:19,791
If we all do our share,
we'll get by.

243
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,577
- Hands up! It's a "poontch"!
- Not funny.

244
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:47,109
François, go finish your breakfast!

245
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:49,702
Go on!

246
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:53,573
You don't want to eat?

247
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,125
Come.

248
00:19:55,686 --> 00:20:00,180
There. That's the first time
I measured your height.

249
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:03,011
This will be my first Christmas
without you.

250
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:04,822
It won't be a real Christmas.

251
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:07,396
Grandpa and Granny
won't be here either.

252
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,753
There will just be Marga and Pilar.

253
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,424
It's all because of them.

254
00:20:11,543 --> 00:10:12,307
Your parents say
they can't pay me anymore.

255
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:13,831
Your parents say
they can't pay me anymore.

256
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:17,423
But I know why I was fired.
They've become Communists!

257
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,914
Is that why we're moving?

258
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:20,092
You are like me!

259
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:22,218
I fled Cuba, driven from my home!

260
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:24,362
Now you, too,
must abandon your house!

261
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:28,239
- It's Fidel, he drives them nuts!
- Then...

262
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:30,686
Fidel is to blame.

263
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,502
Mom!

264
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,303
Mom!

265
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:20,831
Mom!

266
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,880
Anna! What is it?

267
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:25,498
I dreamt we were in our old house.

268
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:29,297
What's that noise?

269
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,804
It's a meeting for my work.

270
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:34,298
Again!
We always have people over!

271
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:38,097
Come say hello for once.

272
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:39,637
This is Emilio.

273
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,143
And Pierre.

274
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,946
They work with me
for Allende's government in Chile.

275
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,521
My daughter Anna.
My little mummy.

276
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:51,792
You mean... like those mummies?

277
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:53,886
Your daughter is reactionary?

278
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,176
She insisted on staying
in Catholic school.

279
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,224
She made a real scene!

280
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,114
You put her in Catholic school?

281
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:04,627
It was a long time ago.
Marie wanted her to go.

282
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:05,832
Why do you say that?

283
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,252
My school is fine!

284
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,987
You liked it, too!

285
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:20,921
Your brother sleeps well.

286
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:23,829
He breathes so loud,
it keeps me awake.

287
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,621
Don't exaggerate.

288
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:29,565
What's that?

289
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:35,192
I told you not to read this anymore!
Mickey Mouse is a fascist!

290
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:40,737
Don't sulk.
I am leaving tomorrow.

291
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:43,242
For as long as last time?

292
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:44,812
No.

293
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:47,516
And Mom is staying here.

294
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:50,269
And the lady
who picks you up from school.

295
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,264
- Panayota!
- Yes, Panayota.

296
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,349
She's nice, right?

297
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:59,919
Okay, she's not much fun,
but she's very unhappy.

298
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,921
Her husband is in jail.
She fled from Greece.

299
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:04,047
You know where that is?

300
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,567
Tomorrow look in your atlas.

301
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:09,652
Now go to sleep.

302
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,690
Filomena had to leave Cuba too,
to escape the <i>barbudos.</i>

303
00:23:12,774 --> 00:23:15,072
That's different.

304
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:17,329
Go to sleep.

305
00:23:33,754 --> 00:23:38,453
Hello, Sister Anne-Marie!

306
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,353
Miss Anna de la Mesa?

307
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,549
Your parents want you
out of Bible study.

308
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:53,405
This has been granted exceptionally
to Miss de la Mesa.

309
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,823
There will be no others.

310
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,680
Come, Anna.

311
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:38,047
I don't like the skin.

312
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:41,309
We can't eat yet.
We haven't had our bath.

313
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:44,117
Tomato skin is good for your health.

314
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:45,970
Eat!

315
00:25:21,077 --> 00:25:24,478
Is <i>Marie Claire</i> for me?

316
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:32,091
- It's late. I must leave.
- Thanks.

317
00:25:33,707 --> 00:25:37,370
You can leave the table, François.

318
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:50,713
It's very good.
You should taste it.

319
00:25:58,732 --> 00:26:00,632
Why can't I go to Bible study?

320
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,964
Didn't Dad explain?

321
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:05,560
He just said religious stories
were nonsense.

322
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:08,106
Anna, you insisted to stay
in that school,

323
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:09,877
and I promised you would.

324
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:15,174
But to convince your dad,
I had to make some concessions.

325
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,572
Now I'll heat your plate,
and you'll finish it!

326
00:26:22,022 --> 00:26:24,582
Don't waste food!
Some people have nothing to eat!

327
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:30,863
Your brother isn't so fussy!

328
00:26:30,947 --> 00:26:33,415
All these changes
are hard for him, too!

329
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:36,705
It's tough for me, too.

330
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,651
So help me. And eat.

331
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:41,552
- I want to go to Bible study!
- Stop it!

332
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,882
I want Bible study,
our big house and Filomena back!

333
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,047
You're not the only one
who wants things!

334
00:26:48,131 --> 00:26:51,100
I want your dad here!
I'm sick of unpacking!

335
00:26:51,217 --> 00:26:53,913
I want to write on politics,
not cooking!

336
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:55,929
With Filomena, life was better!

337
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:58,183
We ate normal food,
we had a garden,

338
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,217
we bathed before dinner!

339
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,335
You want a bath? Fine!
It will calm you down!

340
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,909
I'll calm down! I promise!

341
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:07,313
I'll calm down!

342
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:08,431
Are you done?

343
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:10,752
I hate you! I hate you!

344
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:11,980
I hate you!

345
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:23,550
Have you and Dad
become Communists?

346
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,140
Why do you ask?

347
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,194
Are we poor now?

348
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:28,284
Poor?

349
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:31,772
We eat weird things
in this tiny apartment.

350
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,844
Those people come all the time.

351
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:37,164
We have less money,
but we're not poor.

352
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:39,968
If you ask Grandpa and Granny
for money,

353
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,518
can we have our old house
and Filomena back?

354
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:45,010
Anna, please.

355
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,146
Do you want to sleep with me?

356
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:51,455
If we find money,
can life be as before?

357
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:56,294
You don't find money.
You earn it or save it.

358
00:27:56,391 --> 00:28:01,727
I won't ask my parents
to pay for my heating and light.

359
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,713
That's enough.
Let's sleep.

360
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:33,692
What are you doing?

361
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,738
Tell me, what are you doing there?

362
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:41,061
You talk of right and wrong,
and now you steal!

363
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:43,235
It's to pay our bills!

364
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:45,263
Next Thursday, you'll apologize.

365
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:46,730
Mom, my snack!

366
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:49,597
I forgot. This isn't the time!

367
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:52,933
You also forgot to comb me.

368
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:15,259
Your snack is a "blacklava."
It's very good.

369
00:29:33,947 --> 00:29:35,107
What are you doing?

370
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:37,183
We must not turn this light on!

371
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:40,684
- Why?
- Because.

372
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:48,136
François, turn it off!

373
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,688
What are you doing now?

374
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,729
Leave me alone!

375
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,746
I don't mind
that you quit Bible study.

376
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:25,618
Can I come for tea on Candlemas
and play in your garden?

377
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,985
Can I sleep over?

378
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:30,210
Quiet, girls!

379
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:36,917
There's enough daylight!

380
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,370
But...

381
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:49,512
Aren't you in the park?

382
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:51,554
Isabelle!

383
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:58,725
Why are you crying?

384
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:04,368
Is it because of the General?

385
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:08,106
- What's wrong with her?
- I'll explain later, not now.

386
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:09,675
We have to talk.

387
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:11,056
Don't worry.

388
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:13,475
- I can't stay with you?
- Take them outside.

389
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,870
- My sister-in-law needs me.
- All right.

390
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,675
You're not eating it?

391
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:39,133
Don't you want to go play?

392
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:46,131
You and I could play a game,
or I can tell you a story.

393
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:49,347
I can tell you a story of mythology.

394
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,169
Any princesses in it?

395
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,744
Even better.
There are goddesses.

396
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:57,797
To understand, you must know
that in the beginning...

397
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,323
The beginning?

398
00:31:59,425 --> 00:32:01,916
When the world started,
if you prefer.

399
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:04,698
Shall I go on?

400
00:32:05,315 --> 00:32:08,284
In the beginning,
there was only Raos.

401
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:09,595
Raos?

402
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:11,679
Like the word "chaos".

403
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:14,433
Everything was born out of Chaos.

404
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:17,541
First came the Day and the Night.

405
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,069
Then Gaia, the Earth.

406
00:32:20,163 --> 00:32:22,529
She's the oldest Greek goddess.

407
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:25,979
The Mother of all living beings.

408
00:32:26,085 --> 00:32:29,577
She gave birth to Uranos, the Sky.

409
00:32:29,672 --> 00:32:31,401
She made it just big enough

410
00:32:31,507 --> 00:32:37,412
so the Sky and the Earth
fit perfectly together.

411
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:56,723
This isn't the zoological gardens!

412
00:32:56,816 --> 00:33:01,583
I didn't say we would go there.
I said it was a surprise.

413
00:33:04,957 --> 00:33:07,619
- Hello.
- Hello.

414
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:10,524
Hello.

415
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:23,256
Free abortion and contraception

416
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,098
We're fighting the 1920 law.

417
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,377
- Hello.
- Hello.

418
00:33:44,364 --> 00:33:46,093
Here are your pills.

419
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:49,836
It's very simple.
Take one a day.

420
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:51,504
Is Suzanne here?

421
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,188
Yes. I'll get her.

422
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:59,415
You could say hello.

423
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,215
Are they gypsies?

424
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,264
What are you saying?

425
00:34:03,357 --> 00:34:05,052
Did you see how they're dressed?

426
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:10,222
Filomena said gypsies kidnap kids
and sell them to circuses!

427
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,187
I tried to call you.
Isabelle left.

428
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:14,436
Was Isabelle the surprise?

429
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:17,231
- What? I talked to her yesterday!
- I know, everything was fine.

430
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:19,863
But she spoke to your brother
and decided to leave.

431
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,143
Couldn't you stop her?

432
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,023
Marie, we help women
who want abortion and peace.

433
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,054
This is not jail.

434
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,909
Stay for a while!

435
00:34:28,015 --> 00:34:30,950
You wanted Anna to see the house.

436
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,400
- Would you like that?
- No, we'll go.

437
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,047
Don't take it that way.
You didn't force her.

438
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:39,431
An abortion is tough
on a young woman like her.

439
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,883
I want you to write that book.

440
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,607
So women like Isabelle
know they can choose.

441
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,933
Okay. I'll call you.

442
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:50,934
Let's go.

443
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,788
Mom, what's an abortion?

444
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,222
What's an abortion?

445
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,027
Don't shout!

446
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,918
I'll explain later.
Come along.

447
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,396
Don't be sad. It's normal
that she went to Bordeaux.

448
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,752
Her house and her husband are there.

449
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,215
Stop talking nonsense.

450
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,315
Mom!

451
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,471
Mom!

452
00:35:26,632 --> 00:35:29,795
Mom! I want to go to Bordeaux
for my vacation!

453
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:35,981
Tickle, tickle!

454
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:39,780
Tickle, tickle!

455
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:46,283
That's enough.

456
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:47,358
That's enough.

457
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:49,853
That's enough.

458
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:57,142
Calm down, kids.
See you later.

459
00:35:57,296 --> 00:36:00,094
- See you later.
- See you later.

460
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,802
Time for your bath.

461
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,975
Will you tell us a story with gods
in the bath?

462
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,527
Yes.

463
00:36:18,518 --> 00:36:20,213
It's cold! It's cold!

464
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:24,483
What's wrong with the heater?

465
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:44,716
When Isabelle came,
I was happy to be helpful,

466
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:46,548
but I failed.

467
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,927
You did the right thing.

468
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:03,969
I called Mom to tell her Anna
would like to go on vacation there.

469
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,862
She had the nerve to tell me Isabelle
was back, and things were fine!

470
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,646
I didn't even react to that!

471
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,389
I said nothing, like an idiot!

472
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:18,076
How can I write a book
against all this hypocrisy?

473
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,652
Marie, you confuse things.

474
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:24,452
Writing that book is a great idea.

475
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:27,356
You'll learn a lot.
You'll see.

476
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:33,923
Anna, wake up!

477
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:37,036
We're "Sundaying"
with Mom and Dad!

478
00:37:46,822 --> 00:37:50,019
Hello, kids.
Did you sleep well?

479
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,126
No "Sundaying" today?

480
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,025
Don't look so sad.

481
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:56,264
Today we'll show you
something important.

482
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,483
What?

483
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,142
Group solidarity.

484
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:04,921
In Spain, some people
are facing death penalty.

485
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:09,146
So, we go out in the streets with
other people to show we disagree.

486
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,898
A family must stay together
on Sunday.

487
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:16,426
See, it's not a good idea
to take the kids to a demonstration.

488
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,714
No, it's fine.
They must learn.

489
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:19,955
Come sit down.

490
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:21,776
Learn what?

491
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:24,052
For 15 years,
Quino and I fought together.

492
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,939
He died for nothing.

493
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,664
That's what I learned.

494
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:31,622
Marga, stop it!

495
00:38:32,868 --> 00:38:35,530
Dad, what's group solidarity?

496
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,374
Franco is a murderer!

497
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:39,466
Franco is a murderer!

498
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:54,632
Franco is a Fascist!
Stop the Franquists!

499
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,324
Franco is a Fascist!

500
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,859
Franco is a Fascist!

501
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:08,127
Are you all right?
Did I hurt you?

502
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,915
No death penalty!

503
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,276
No death penalty!

504
00:40:12,718 --> 00:30:12,687
You have to run!

505
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:14,211
You have to run!

506
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,674
Are you okay?

507
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:36,756
I want to pee.

508
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:40,292
Are you okay?
You're not hurt?

509
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:42,420
I'm hungry.
I want to go home.

510
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:45,609
Me, me, me!

511
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,507
That was group solidarity!

512
00:40:48,604 --> 00:40:50,538
We're here for your future!

513
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,342
My future?

514
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:55,427
When you're older,
you'll see that we were right.

515
00:40:55,528 --> 00:40:58,019
In Spain, they kill men like Quino
because of their ideas.

516
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:00,664
In Latin America,
the poor live in shacks!

517
00:41:00,774 --> 00:41:03,436
I know we have to help the poor
and be polite to them,

518
00:41:03,536 --> 00:41:05,663
but why do all that?

519
00:41:05,788 --> 00:41:07,813
Let's do what Granny does!

520
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:11,459
Where does Granny fit in?

521
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:14,284
Stop talking nonsense!

522
00:41:16,298 --> 00:41:18,789
- Are you both okay?
- Fine.

523
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:20,943
My love.

524
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,408
Come in, Anna.

525
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:30,702
Then stay there!

526
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,583
Think about what I told you!

527
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:33,655
I won't!

528
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,376
I'm glad I'm going
to Granny and Grandpa's!

529
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,026
They don't bother me
with group solidarity!

530
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,470
Anna, calm down!

531
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:12,568
I took the skin off.

532
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,841
Go on, eat!

533
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,594
You must be hungry.

534
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,905
Are things okay at school?

535
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,512
Yes, but it's hard to do homework
while sharing a room with François.

536
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:28,635
Oh, my dear,
that makes you even worthier.

537
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,718
Granny, I'm not allowed
to take Bible study.

538
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:37,903
Your parents did that?

539
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:40,297
Hi, Anna.

540
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:47,332
What is it?

541
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:49,143
Mom sewed it on for me.

542
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,013
Look.

543
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,600
I'm Anna de la Mesa.

544
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,035
I'm going to
Chateau de la Caussade.

545
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,223
They made her travel all alone.

546
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:08,034
Is she sick? What's wrong?

547
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,017
The Greek god of wine
was Dionysius.

548
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,728
You know what the Romans
called him?

549
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:19,523
No.

550
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,128
Bacchus.

551
00:43:21,248 --> 00:43:25,378
They told the same stories.
They just changed the names.

552
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,241
- Who came first?
- The Greeks.

553
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:32,002
Then the Romans took their stories.

554
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:36,144
So that's why Panayota
says the Greeks did it all.

555
00:43:36,263 --> 00:43:39,027
Even the beginning of the World.

556
00:43:39,124 --> 00:43:40,955
In what way?

557
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:46,646
The Bible says
God made everything in six days.

558
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:50,039
But Gaia and Uranos
were here before that.

559
00:43:50,135 --> 00:43:52,660
In Ancient times, people
believed all kinds of nonsense.

560
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,079
It was just stories
for ignorant people.

561
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,743
Look.

562
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,428
A fox got caught in this trap.

563
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:06,789
To be free, it gnawed off its paw.

564
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,712
We're taking all this
to the presbytery?

565
00:44:19,832 --> 00:44:25,600
First we'll ask our help
if they want any of it.

566
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:29,911
The presbytery gives it
to orphans and the poor?

567
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:31,985
Why do you ask?

568
00:44:32,077 --> 00:44:35,012
We've done this before.

569
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,075
Granny, do you think farmers
should share fields

570
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,412
among those who have lots
and those who have less?

571
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,043
Those are the ideas of your parents.

572
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:54,971
You think they're Communists?

573
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,843
Who are the Communists, Granny?

574
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:02,413
Students, workers,
people like everyone else.

575
00:45:02,516 --> 00:45:04,609
But most of them are poor.

576
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,644
- What do they want?
- Everything!

577
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,829
Our houses, our vines,

578
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:11,567
our clothes, our money,
and your toys.

579
00:45:11,658 --> 00:45:12,818
Why?

580
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:15,503
I guess they don't like us.

581
00:45:15,696 --> 00:45:16,685
They don't like us?

582
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:19,433
We give them milk, clothes,
we're polite to them,

583
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:20,830
and they don't like us?

584
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:27,400
What do you do next?

585
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:31,000
I leave it off,
until it gets really dark.

586
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,315
Sometimes, I turn the heater off.

587
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:38,391
Do you really think
it will change anything?

588
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:44,974
You should find a spot for yourself.

589
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,524
We're home.

590
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,953
Marie?

591
00:47:19,811 --> 00:47:22,336
Don't move!

592
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:24,938
Come, Anna.

593
00:47:35,277 --> 00:47:38,075
Come here.

594
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:04,948
Anna, what are you doing?

595
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:09,465
This is a nice little spot.

596
00:48:12,372 --> 00:48:14,806
Not really.

597
00:48:17,986 --> 00:48:20,454
So when can I come sleep over?

598
00:48:20,547 --> 00:48:23,778
You promised,
and my mom said yes.

599
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:25,818
Well, okay.

600
00:48:25,911 --> 00:48:29,972
Great, see you tomorrow!

601
00:48:33,085 --> 00:48:34,780
Well...

602
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:37,557
- Are you alone?
- No.

603
00:48:41,593 --> 00:48:44,255
Hi, Anna!

604
00:48:45,097 --> 00:48:47,497
Mom, who is the Chinese lady?

605
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,567
Anna, what did I tell you
this morning?

606
00:48:58,694 --> 00:49:00,286
If the doors are closed,

607
00:49:00,379 --> 00:49:02,939
I can't come in
because you're working!

608
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:05,881
They come to tell me their lives.
It's hard for them.

609
00:49:06,084 --> 00:49:09,850
Where is Panayota?

610
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,124
I forgot. I'm sorry.

611
00:49:13,225 --> 00:49:16,023
Panayota went home to Greece.
Her husband got out of jail.

612
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,587
Mai Lahn will be taking her place.

613
00:49:23,802 --> 00:49:25,030
What's her name?

614
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,978
Mai Lahn is from Vietnam.
We talked about that country.

615
00:49:29,116 --> 00:49:33,644
I know! It's where kids
are burnt with napalm.

616
00:49:33,745 --> 00:49:35,474
I should have warned you.
I'm sorry.

617
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:37,989
But don't burst in on me!

618
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:40,984
You said never to follow strangers!

619
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,883
You should have asked François.
He knows her.

620
00:49:58,337 --> 00:50:00,134
Anna, you're disqualified.

621
00:50:00,255 --> 00:50:02,348
It's a relay race.
You must pass the baton.

622
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:08,215
I can't believe it.

623
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:18,923
You have to comb her hair
before we leave.

624
00:50:19,107 --> 00:50:21,075
Tell me the rest of the story.

625
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:22,294
What story?

626
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,217
About the frog whose pool dried up.

627
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:27,000
It didn't want to die

628
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,439
and went to see
the Emperor of the Sky

629
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,323
to scold the Rain Genie.

630
00:50:31,503 --> 00:50:34,097
- What's a Genie?
- He's like a God.

631
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,392
Are there other genies,
like the genie of wine?

632
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:39,534
Not of wine, but of the Sea,
of the Moon.

633
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:42,281
Is there a story
about how the world began?

634
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:43,313
Yes.

635
00:50:43,432 --> 00:50:45,161
Not that one! I know it!

636
00:50:45,267 --> 00:50:50,295
I heard it while you were on vacation.
I want the end of the frog story!

637
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:54,847
The frog doesn't want to die.

638
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,459
So it decides to go see
the Emperor of the Sky.

639
00:50:57,562 --> 00:50:58,221
What?

640
00:50:58,338 --> 00:51:02,399
The Emperor of the Sky,
the boss of the Rain Genie.

641
00:51:02,617 --> 00:51:04,608
On the way...

642
00:51:04,711 --> 00:51:07,373
- As it's going there?
- Yes.

643
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,211
It meets other animals.

644
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:17,155
A crab, a fox, a bear,
and last a little bee.

645
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:21,317
The frog tells them
that if they'll come with it,

646
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:27,359
they'll have a better chance
of being heard.

647
00:51:27,476 --> 00:51:31,503
So the animals decide
to go with the frog.

648
00:51:31,596 --> 00:51:33,757
And they all leave together.

649
00:51:33,865 --> 00:51:35,856
It worked because
they went as a group?

650
00:51:35,984 --> 00:51:41,684
Yes, it worked
because they were numerous.

651
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:45,308
Who came first,
the Greeks or the Romans?

652
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:46,783
Well, girls?

653
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:51,187
Who thinks the Romans came first?

654
00:51:54,594 --> 00:51:59,896
Who else is for the Romans?

655
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,130
Are you done?

656
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,772
Are you done?

657
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,139
You're all wrong.

658
00:52:15,307 --> 00:52:18,299
I tried to be like the frog.
They all said the Romans.

659
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:21,174
So like the bear and the bee,
I went along.

660
00:52:21,279 --> 00:52:22,507
Grandpa had told me.

661
00:52:22,614 --> 00:52:27,210
I won't trust group solidarity again!

662
00:52:29,763 --> 00:52:33,130
I'm not sure I understand.

663
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:37,575
She confused group solidarity
with sheep behavior.

664
00:52:37,746 --> 00:52:40,772
Am I right?

665
00:52:41,933 --> 00:52:44,902
How can you tell sheep
from group solidarity?

666
00:52:45,086 --> 00:52:48,647
You're never mistaken?

667
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,083
Hello.

668
00:52:52,177 --> 00:52:53,041
It's that way.

669
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,439
Another "whatness"!

670
00:52:57,566 --> 00:53:00,000
You mean witness.

671
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:05,588
Your dad and I are proud
that you tried group solidarity.

672
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,173
And I'm glad
you're inviting friends again.

673
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:12,931
Cecile is sleeping over.
I spoke to her mom.

674
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:17,353
Cecile is coming here?

675
00:53:18,845 --> 00:53:21,109
- Hello.
- Hello.

676
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:32,210
I'll be right back.

677
00:53:47,999 --> 00:53:50,968
- Hello.
- Hello.

678
00:53:58,468 --> 00:53:59,901
- Thanks a lot.
- Good-bye.

679
00:53:59,995 --> 00:54:01,326
Good-bye.

680
00:54:01,496 --> 00:54:02,793
Where are you going, Mom?

681
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:04,083
To Marga's.

682
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,624
Mai Lahn is staying
until Dad is back.

683
00:54:06,726 --> 00:54:07,818
See you later.

684
00:54:08,003 --> 00:54:09,698
See you later.

685
00:54:16,144 --> 00:54:18,237
That's a lot of people
in such a tiny place.

686
00:54:18,405 --> 00:54:21,932
- It's not tiny!
- It is compared to your old house.

687
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:25,935
Here, we don't have to be careful.
We do what we want!

688
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,859
But you have to share a room.

689
00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:30,184
It's nicer with Anna.
I'm less scared.

690
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,395
Someone is always leaving
in our family.

691
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:36,809
And you don't have
a garden anymore!

692
00:54:36,923 --> 00:54:41,189
We go to the little park.
It's nice.

693
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,317
What's wrong with Cecile?

694
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:06,181
She saw Dad naked.
She'd never seen a dickie.

695
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,747
Sure, yours have been cut off.

696
00:56:08,923 --> 00:56:11,050
No, they haven't.
We have duckies.

697
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:13,346
And what are duckies?

698
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:15,656
Dickies that have been cut off!

699
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,263
Shut up! I want to sleep!

700
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:45,598
We need engineers.
They're important.

701
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,456
All the Americans will leave.

702
00:56:47,554 --> 00:56:49,351
To hell with them.

703
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:53,076
The Americans, sure,
but not the engineers.

704
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,344
Stronger towards them.

705
00:56:56,429 --> 00:56:58,590
- That's the important thing.
- I can't believe it.

706
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:02,472
- Benito.
- Thank you.

707
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,452
Anna?

708
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,142
Are you okay?

709
00:57:10,243 --> 00:57:11,938
Where are Mom and Dad?

710
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,454
Fernando went to get Marie
at your aunt's.

711
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,293
Go back to bed.

712
00:57:22,113 --> 00:57:23,978
Once you've nationalized,

713
00:57:24,082 --> 00:57:26,414
the imperialist pigs will leave
and destroy everything.

714
00:57:26,534 --> 00:57:29,662
Right! That's why
we're looking for people here.

715
00:57:29,754 --> 00:57:32,450
I am afraid I will forget
what I need to ask them.

716
00:57:32,565 --> 00:57:34,192
Stay here if you want.

717
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:44,459
You can't stop production.
You need that money.

718
00:57:45,612 --> 00:57:47,273
Anna!

719
00:57:54,287 --> 00:57:58,087
Are you sure
you don't want to go to bed?

720
00:58:01,553 --> 00:58:04,078
You want something?
Some food?

721
00:58:23,683 --> 00:58:25,378
Done.

722
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,411
Are you <i>barbudos?</i>

723
00:58:34,485 --> 00:58:36,646
What do you know about them?

724
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:40,673
They're Communists
who want nuclear war!

725
00:58:41,668 --> 00:58:45,900
Granny says they want
to take our money and our house.

726
00:58:45,997 --> 00:58:50,491
I see why Fernando
calls her a little mummy.

727
00:58:52,954 --> 00:58:56,390
Look, I'll show you something.

728
00:58:56,541 --> 00:59:01,308
Imagine that all the wealth
of the world is an orange.

729
00:59:01,446 --> 00:59:05,382
Some want to keep the orange
all to themselves,

730
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,501
once they've really peeled it.

731
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:13,344
And others want to divide it
in equal parts

732
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:16,153
to share it.

733
00:59:16,236 --> 00:59:22,800
Your father, your mother and us,
we're for sharing.

734
00:59:22,909 --> 00:59:26,504
So are the <i>barbudos.</i>

735
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:28,145
Taste it.

736
00:59:30,825 --> 00:59:33,521
Taste it.

737
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:49,531
This is the game.

738
00:59:49,661 --> 00:59:51,720
You buy a plate from me
for five francs.

739
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,789
What for?

740
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:56,307
To resell it for 10 francs!

741
00:59:56,409 --> 00:59:59,970
It's bad to make profits
and sell things for so much.

742
01:00:00,071 --> 01:00:02,938
Then some people
can't buy anything.

743
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:06,220
That's good.
That way you'll have money.

744
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:09,124
Please buy something from me.

745
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,596
Why can't it be free?

746
01:00:11,708 --> 00:50:14,213
We could swap things,
instead of always buying.

747
00:50:14,213 --> 00:50:15,407
We could swap things,
instead of always buying.

748
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,816
Look, I take this.

749
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:20,364
In exchange, I do you a favor.

750
01:00:20,466 --> 01:00:22,161
I could help with your homework.

751
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,229
Hey, we're playing shop!

752
01:00:25,363 --> 01:00:28,059
I've already done my homework!

753
01:00:30,076 --> 01:00:30,804
Mom!

754
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,673
Why aren't you in bed?
It's late.

755
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,533
We tried to explain

756
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:37,665
how to redistribute
wealth equitably, but...

757
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:40,893
She wouldn't buy it.

758
01:00:41,446 --> 01:00:42,140
Go to bed!

759
01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:45,156
I think she wanted to talk to you.

760
01:00:45,258 --> 01:00:46,054
Really?

761
01:00:46,234 --> 01:00:49,795
She'd never seen a boy's dickie!

762
01:00:49,904 --> 01:00:53,931
Without a little brother, you would
have been like your friend Cecile.

763
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,178
Didn't Granny tell you about it?

764
01:00:57,837 --> 01:01:00,772
Not even about the little seed?

765
01:01:00,898 --> 01:01:02,126
Not a chance!

766
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,921
Some parents don't tell their kids.

767
01:01:05,011 --> 01:01:06,774
Why?

768
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:10,828
Because some things can't be said?

769
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,834
Who told you that?

770
01:01:13,953 --> 01:01:18,913
Filomena and Granny.

771
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:23,721
Is it better to say or not to say?

772
01:01:24,255 --> 01:01:26,450
It's always better to talk.

773
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:31,299
But that's not your problem.
You're a talker.

774
01:01:32,163 --> 01:01:34,324
Go to bed!

775
01:01:34,449 --> 01:01:36,178
And be nice to your friend Cecile!

776
01:01:36,284 --> 01:01:37,911
But she's not nice!

777
01:01:38,002 --> 01:01:39,526
She didn't like Mai Lahn's rice,

778
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:43,274
she says we have a tiny home,
and there's no garden!

779
01:01:43,383 --> 01:01:45,408
I know someone
who complains about everything,

780
01:01:45,518 --> 01:01:47,213
who says that the park is dirty,

781
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,686
and who turns the heating off
in mid-winter.

782
01:01:49,797 --> 01:01:52,960
Do you know her?

783
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,828
No.

784
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,776
Come along.

785
01:01:58,831 --> 01:02:01,026
Miss de la Mesa.

786
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,311
Please.

787
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:09,142
Go wait in the study room.

788
01:02:11,135 --> 01:02:14,366
- Are you okay?
- Leave me alone.

789
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,641
Starting today, girls,

790
01:02:16,724 --> 01:02:20,683
we'll study the life
of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

791
01:02:41,582 --> 01:02:43,812
I was born in France in 1949.

792
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:46,344
I'm the third of a family
of seven children.

793
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:50,100
My father was a factory worker.
My mother was a housewife.

794
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,497
At the age of 16 and a half,
I worked in the factory.

795
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:57,079
I met a boy there,
and I got pregnant. That's it.

796
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,936
Don't try to tell your story
in chronological order,

797
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,703
or any kind of order.

798
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,980
Just say what comes to mind.

799
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:08,414
If we want more details,
we will ask you a question.

800
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:13,188
Go on.

801
01:03:14,065 --> 01:03:17,557
I didn't make enough money
to raise my baby alone.

802
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:21,434
He cried all the time.
I was exhausted.

803
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:23,742
Then he was put in a foster home.

804
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,002
I only saw him on Saturdays.

805
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:28,866
I had a nervous breakdown,

806
01:03:28,963 --> 01:03:32,899
and I was in a mental hospital
for 10 months.

807
01:03:33,025 --> 01:03:35,255
When I got out,
I wanted my son back,

808
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:39,855
but they said I had to show
three months of salary.

809
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:43,407
So I got a job as a typist.

810
01:03:43,536 --> 01:03:46,562
But I can't spell at all.

811
01:03:46,731 --> 01:03:48,824
And I am a single mother.

812
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:53,225
- So no "Sundaying"?
- Hush, let me listen.

813
01:03:53,312 --> 01:03:57,271
I would have done anything to keep
my baby, even go back to the factory.

814
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:01,224
Then May '68 came.
Anyone could go to college.

815
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,222
I managed to work and study
at the same time.

816
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:08,325
And I read books.

817
01:04:12,732 --> 01:04:15,530
Are you hungry?

818
01:04:21,432 --> 01:04:25,334
Dad, what's May '68?

819
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:32,347
During the month of May, in 1968,

820
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,420
people demonstrated
to change things.

821
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:39,235
- To change what?
- Lots of things.

822
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:42,311
A bit like what we're doing in Chile.

823
01:04:42,428 --> 01:04:44,555
Were you there, in May '68?

824
01:04:45,264 --> 01:04:47,960
I would have liked to,
but I had a job.

825
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:49,737
You saw nothing to change?

826
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:51,149
That's not it.

827
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:54,330
Sometimes you miss out.
Then it's too late.

828
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,739
There. It won't take long.

829
01:04:58,886 --> 01:05:01,616
Are there things to change now?

830
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,332
Sure.

831
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:08,216
There was Quino's death,
then Marga.

832
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,553
We went to Chile,
Marie decided to write her book.

833
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:14,982
So you were wrong, before?

834
01:05:15,152 --> 01:05:17,143
Not entirely.

835
01:05:17,238 --> 01:05:21,766
I have a beautiful family
with two beautiful kids.

836
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:24,717
Stop! Stop! Stop!

837
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,863
How can you be sure
you're not wrong now?

838
01:05:27,974 --> 01:05:31,273
I'm not wrong.
I try to help others.

839
01:05:31,419 --> 01:05:34,877
Look, I need 10 minutes,
then my work's done.

840
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,361
Is 10 minutes long?

841
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:43,573
Depends.
If you're busy, it goes fast.

842
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,880
Quick, hide!
There's a policeman!

843
01:05:57,445 --> 01:05:59,504
Move over!

844
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:07,100
Move your foot!

845
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:10,883
If he comes close,
will he throw napalm on us?

846
01:06:11,017 --> 01:06:13,247
No, napalm is only used in wars!

847
01:06:13,352 --> 01:06:15,752
They torture with napalm
during "poontches"!

848
01:06:15,855 --> 01:06:17,049
But not kids!

849
01:06:17,623 --> 01:06:20,091
Will he start a nuclear war?

850
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:23,957
You're confusing everything.
The <i>barbudos</i> start nuclear wars!

851
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:26,293
Like Filomena said,
they're red and bearded.

852
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:27,379
You got it all wrong!

853
01:06:27,475 --> 01:06:30,444
Santa Claus is red and bearded!

854
01:06:44,717 --> 01:06:46,582
Let's play Allende and Franco.

855
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:49,323
I'll be Allende.
He's the good guy.

856
01:06:49,447 --> 01:06:51,915
So is Franco.
Dad's dad knew him.

857
01:06:51,991 --> 01:06:53,891
He's bad in Pilar's song!

858
01:06:54,001 --> 01:06:55,901
What song?

859
01:07:06,297 --> 01:07:09,289
Jesus was crucified
on Mount Golgotha,

860
01:07:09,408 --> 01:07:11,638
in Jerusalem.

861
01:07:12,603 --> 01:07:15,197
- What do you do during Bible study?
- Nothing.

862
01:07:15,356 --> 01:07:17,187
- Don't you miss it?
- No.

863
01:07:17,308 --> 01:07:20,334
What do you do with God,
Jesus and the Virgin Mary?

864
01:07:20,853 --> 01:07:22,047
Nothing.

865
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,139
I know why she skips Bible study.

866
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,648
Her parents
have become "beatnik-hippy".

867
01:07:26,759 --> 01:07:28,693
They don't have
a big house anymore.

868
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,703
They live in a tiny crowded place,
and they eat weird food.

869
01:07:31,822 --> 01:07:33,050
It's not weird!

870
01:07:33,207 --> 01:07:36,370
Her parents go around naked.

871
01:07:36,544 --> 01:07:39,138
I won't invite you again!
You're an idiot!

872
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:41,831
So stupid you've never seen
a boy's dickie!

873
01:07:46,779 --> 01:07:49,976
What's a boy's dickie like?

874
01:07:50,174 --> 01:07:52,074
She doesn't even know
how kids are made!

875
01:07:52,176 --> 01:07:52,870
Yes, I know!

876
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:54,332
Oh yeah? How?

877
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,580
- I won't tell you!
- See, you don't know.

878
01:07:56,722 --> 01:07:57,450
Yes, I do!

879
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:58,639
No, you don't!

880
01:07:58,816 --> 01:07:59,305
Yes!

881
01:07:59,483 --> 01:07:59,847
No!

882
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:00,390
Yes!

883
01:08:00,518 --> 01:08:00,950
No!

884
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:02,237
Yes!

885
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,323
What's a "beatnik-hippy"?

886
01:08:15,407 --> 01:08:18,171
I don't know.

887
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:22,190
So how are babies made?

888
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,740
Your parents never told you?

889
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:29,133
When I ask,
they pretend not to hear me.

890
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:33,690
My parents do that too.
Especially my grandmother.

891
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,080
Why is that?

892
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:36,768
I don't know.

893
01:08:36,887 --> 01:08:40,914
My mom acts like a hen,
with her neck.

894
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:48,708
So how are kids made?

895
01:08:51,735 --> 01:08:54,966
- What happened?
- Please, ladies.

896
01:08:55,072 --> 01:09:02,035
- This is a scandal!
- What are you talking about?

897
01:09:02,129 --> 01:09:04,654
- You know what I mean!
- Not at all!

898
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:09,134
I can't even discuss it!

899
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:12,442
I'm leaving!

900
01:09:17,369 --> 01:09:19,963
Come along.

901
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:26,142
I want no sign of you for a while!
Scram!

902
01:09:35,554 --> 01:09:38,990
How is your married life now?

903
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,581
My life now?

904
01:09:40,668 --> 01:09:43,364
In four years of marriage,

905
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,413
my husband has always
seen me pregnant.

906
01:09:45,506 --> 01:09:47,997
The kids are sick all the time.

907
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:50,525
We're always short of money.

908
01:09:50,628 --> 01:09:54,894
I'm often irritated and tired.

909
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,083
I didn't want a fourth child.

910
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:03,112
So every time he touched me,
I turned him down.

911
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:05,954
It's no life for him.

912
01:10:07,019 --> 01:10:13,288
I asked my doctor for advice,
but he said I had marital duties.

913
01:10:13,417 --> 01:00:14,837
So every month I panicked.

914
01:00:14,837 --> 01:00:16,634
So every month I panicked.

915
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:21,382
I checked endlessly for my period,
but got pregnant again.

916
01:10:21,542 --> 01:10:25,069
I wanted to get rid of it,
but I was afraid.

917
01:10:25,271 --> 01:10:28,729
I was told that they sewed
the fetus back on in the hospital,

918
01:10:28,832 --> 01:10:32,233
or that they did
a painful curettage to punish you.

919
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:36,062
And I'm a Catholic.

920
01:10:47,518 --> 01:10:51,181
Faster! Faster!

921
01:10:53,907 --> 01:10:56,102
First! Great, Anna!

922
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:58,448
We're done for today.

923
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:02,752
Don't forget, there will be no class
during the Easter break.

924
01:11:16,413 --> 01:11:17,903
Hi, little mummy!

925
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:19,957
- Well? You sold everything?
- Yeah.

926
01:11:20,059 --> 01:11:22,926
You're rich now.
You can help the poor.

927
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,934
Hello.
How are you?

928
01:11:30,027 --> 01:11:32,928
Hello.
How are you?

929
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:37,833
Mom?

930
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,894
Are you okay?

931
01:11:40,012 --> 01:11:41,946
Hello.
How are you?

932
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,225
Hello.
How are you?

933
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:45,817
Hello.
How are you?

934
01:11:45,909 --> 01:11:48,537
Hello.
How are you?

935
01:11:48,712 --> 01:11:50,703
- Hello.
- Hello.

936
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:53,571
Hello, Miss.

937
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:58,204
Hello, Emilio.

938
01:11:58,305 --> 01:12:00,364
Hi, little mummy.
How are you?

939
01:12:00,474 --> 01:12:02,408
Will you help us win the elections?

940
01:12:02,534 --> 01:12:05,264
I don't know.

941
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:10,094
Dad?

942
01:12:10,209 --> 01:12:12,939
Dad, I thought Allende
had already won.

943
01:12:13,045 --> 01:12:14,740
Yes, that's right.

944
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:17,026
Excuse me.

945
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:20,590
But if the people aren't happy,
they can change things.

946
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:24,450
So, there are various elections.
These are municipal.

947
01:12:24,556 --> 01:12:26,751
If he loses, will Franco win?

948
01:12:26,834 --> 01:12:28,768
Of course not!

949
01:12:28,894 --> 01:12:30,794
But he'll win, don't worry.

950
01:12:38,846 --> 01:12:40,541
Hello.
How are you?

951
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:43,090
Hello.
Fine, thanks. And you?

952
01:12:43,183 --> 01:12:44,650
Fine.

953
01:12:44,768 --> 01:12:46,668
You speak French well.

954
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:49,261
You never talk to me when we meet.

955
01:12:49,356 --> 01:12:52,348
That's true.

956
01:12:53,193 --> 01:12:54,387
Is your school nice?

957
01:12:54,978 --> 01:12:57,208
It's okay, but Mom wants me
to be the best.

958
01:12:57,322 --> 01:12:58,983
Cat!

959
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:25,060
François gets it wrong!
He says "Ay Camellia, Ay Camellia"!

960
01:13:25,184 --> 01:13:28,176
It's not Camellia.
It's "Ay, Carmela! Ay, Carmela"!

961
01:13:28,295 --> 01:13:29,785
I knew it.

962
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,236
Bedtime!

963
01:13:31,356 --> 01:13:33,586
Come! Tomorrow you have school.

964
01:13:33,684 --> 01:13:35,379
And the election results?

965
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,962
We'll know tomorrow morning.
Five minutes more.

966
01:13:38,055 --> 01:13:40,023
We're leaving.

967
01:14:00,828 --> 01:14:02,295
Mom.

968
01:14:20,731 --> 01:14:23,222
- How much did he say?
- I don't know.

969
01:14:23,342 --> 01:14:25,867
Don't you speak Spanish?

970
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,794
You're our good luck charm,
our mascot.

971
01:14:36,922 --> 01:14:40,119
See? Things always end well.

972
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:44,286
<i>From the deep crucible</i>
<i>Of our homeland</i>

973
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:48,389

01:14:48,483 --> 01:14:52,613

<i>Poverty will be overcome</i>

985
01:15:45,048 --> 01:15:46,879
Explain this!

986
01:15:51,163 --> 01:15:53,597
How could you do this to me?

987
01:15:53,774 --> 01:15:55,708
On a day like this!

988
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,269
I signed a petition.

989
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:20,554
343 French women
dare admit they had an abortion.

990
01:16:21,385 --> 01:16:23,114
Everyone will talk about this.

991
01:16:23,303 --> 01:16:25,635
That bothers you?

992
01:16:25,731 --> 01:16:28,666
Everything's fine!
We won the elections!

993
01:16:28,759 --> 01:16:30,750
It's illegal!

994
01:16:30,861 --> 01:16:32,624
You know the 1920 law?

995
01:16:32,813 --> 01:16:36,214
Over 300 signed.
They can't touch us!

996
01:16:36,733 --> 01:16:39,224
You said I'd learn things
writing this book.

997
01:16:39,353 --> 01:16:41,412
You never had an abortion!

998
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:43,844
We needed to be
as numerous as possible.

999
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:44,830
That's it!

1000
01:16:45,025 --> 01:16:46,822
It's group solidarity.

1001
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:48,799
Precisely! That's what it is.

1002
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:59,477
Abortion.
That's what Isabelle did?

1003
01:17:03,877 --> 01:17:08,905
Abortion is when a woman
decides not to stay pregnant,

1004
01:17:09,016 --> 01:17:13,248
because she can't or doesn't want
to have a child at that moment.

1005
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,330
It's her choice, you see?

1006
01:17:24,147 --> 01:17:26,274
What's this macho act?

1007
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,368
Don't you start, like Marga!

1008
01:17:28,452 --> 01:17:30,920
Leave Marga out of it.
At least she fought!

1009
01:17:31,038 --> 01:17:34,201
Your pro-Franco family
is your burden.

1010
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:35,315
What burden?

1011
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,576
How about yours?

1012
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,177
You preach woman's liberation,

1013
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:41,171
and you let nuns and Granny
raise your daughter!

1014
01:17:41,264 --> 01:17:42,231
As for Isabelle...

1015
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,725
Deal with your own guilt,
but let me do my thing!

1016
01:17:45,836 --> 01:17:48,600
- As usual, you confuse everything.
- No, you do!

1017
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:52,166
You fight for a country that is
miles away, that isn't yours!

1018
01:17:52,259 --> 01:17:55,194
- Odd way to make amends.
- For what?

1019
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:57,463
For doing nothing

1020
01:17:57,572 --> 01:18:00,097
when Quino and Marga
risked their life in your country!

1021
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:04,339
For fleeing here rather than choosing
between your sister and your parents!

1022
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,743
You sneaked back once to see Marga,

1023
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,611
and once to introduce Anna
to her grandparents.

1024
01:18:08,742 --> 01:18:11,404
I worked for my family.
And for you!

1025
01:18:11,495 --> 01:18:15,022
You thought it was exotic
to marry a Spaniard,

1026
01:18:15,132 --> 01:18:17,293
as long as it didn't upset your world!

1027
01:18:17,417 --> 01:18:19,510
My family backed Franco,

1028
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:22,638
but you didn't mind
until Marga came!

1029

You're both out to get me!

1037
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,316
Let go of her!

What's gotten into you?

1039
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,479
What is it?
You scared her!

1040
01:18:46,613 --> 01:18:50,674
You should have told me you were
going to sign that manifesto.

1041
01:19:53,296 --> 01:19:55,992
Can we stop now?

1042
01:20:49,953 --> 01:20:55,482
Chile

1043
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,555
Are you okay?

1044
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,959
What are you doing?

1045
01:22:09,065 --> 01:22:12,831
Watching the clock.
Ten minutes is long here.

1046
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,413
"The king was pleased.

1047
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,176
Thinking it over,

1048
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:23,260
he approved of men
being responsible for what they ate.

1049
01:22:23,388 --> 01:22:26,357
After punishing him,
he said to the fisherman:

1050

'Give a man a fish,
you feed him for a day.

1053
01:22:39,212 --> 01:22:42,943
Can we go home now?

1054
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:56,438
I'm hungry!

1055
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,032
Here.

1056
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:59,658
Are you sure?
It won't be a fun trip.

1057
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:09,500
Where did you get this?

1058
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,909
In the library.

1059
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:15,338
Where's your house?

1060
01:24:18,395 --> 01:24:21,057
You lived in the countryside,
like Mom?

1061
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:25,445
It was more like a desert.

1062
01:27:39,929 --> 01:27:43,330
Long ago, my ancestors
tortured people on tables.

1063
01:27:43,516 --> 01:27:45,450
That's how we got our name.

1064
01:27:45,543 --> 01:27:47,238
"Mesa" is Spanish for "table."

1065
01:27:47,353 --> 01:27:49,878
They tortured them
in the house where you went?

1066
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:51,329
No.

1067
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:53,976
I don't know, maybe.
It's so sad.

1068
01:27:54,085 --> 01:27:57,521
Miss de la Mesa.
Repeat what I said.

1069
01:27:57,614 --> 01:28:00,082
"The goat was eaten
by the wolf for disobeying."

1070
01:28:00,199 --> 01:28:02,190
Sit down.

1071
01:28:02,285 --> 01:28:06,153
Getting eaten by the wolf
was its punishment.

1072
01:28:06,264 --> 01:28:09,062
So the text is about
the need for obedience.

1073
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:10,616
Sister, I don't get it.

1074
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:13,975
My grandpa showed me
the paw of a fox caught in a trap.

1075
01:28:14,072 --> 01:28:16,700
It gnawed off its paw to get free.

1076
01:28:16,799 --> 01:28:18,733
That's quite different.

1077
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:22,421
The goat wasn't trapped.
Mr. Seguin fed it, loved it.

1078
01:28:22,522 --> 01:28:25,855
But he kept it tied up.
It's in the book.

1079
01:28:26,025 --> 01:28:29,017
Are you saying
the goat wanted to die?

1080
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,314
That would be a sin.

1081
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,344
Sit down.

1082
01:28:31,456 --> 01:28:34,152
Animals aren't Catholic, Sister.

1083
01:28:34,984 --> 01:28:37,452
What do you think it says?

1084
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:40,300
The goat has two options:

1085
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:43,367
To stay at Mr. Seguin's
or escape to the mountains.

1086
01:28:43,459 --> 01:28:45,893
It leaves,
thinking the wolf won't eat it.

1087
01:28:45,995 --> 01:28:47,462
Stand up to speak!

1088
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:51,573
It goes up to the mountains,
hoping to become free.

1089
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:53,957
Well, it was mistaken.
And so are you.

1090
01:28:54,087 --> 01:28:55,179
Sit down.

1091
01:28:55,338 --> 01:28:58,739
I'll get a bad grade
and lose my bonus points.

1092
01:28:58,841 --> 01:29:02,277
We think you were right.
Trust us.

1093
01:29:02,395 --> 01:29:05,159
You also say Snow White
and Mickey Mouse are fascists.

1094
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:07,417
And the Americans, and napalm!

1095
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:10,238
You make mistakes, like Dad did.

1096
01:29:10,344 --> 01:29:12,005
He said he did.

1097
01:29:12,121 --> 01:29:15,352
Yes, sometimes we're wrong.
So is your teacher.

1098
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:18,621
So, no one's really sure
about anything?

1099
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:20,482
What do you think?

1100
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:24,547
Were you wrong about the goat?

1101
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:26,188
Are you sure?

1102
01:29:26,285 --> 01:29:26,876
Yes.

1103
01:29:26,978 --> 01:29:28,570
You see.

1104
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:31,204
I'm hungry.
Can we eat?

1105
01:29:31,315 --> 01:29:34,045
Yes, come help me.

1106
01:29:35,369 --> 01:29:38,099
Is that why you want
to change schools?

1107
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,401
You won't see
your friend Cecile anymore.

1108
01:29:40,525 --> 01:29:43,961
It doesn't matter.
It's like changing nannies.

1109
01:29:44,053 --> 01:29:45,577
How?

1110
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:47,914
It's sad when they leave,

1111
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:52,586
but if the next one is nice,
it's okay.

1112
01:29:56,332 --> 01:29:59,301
Thanks.

1113
01:29:59,619 --> 01:30:02,383
Here we are!

1114
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:08,067
It's like "Sundaying" on Wednesday!

1115
01:30:08,177 --> 01:30:10,111
Exactly!

1116
01:30:10,213 --> 01:30:11,373
Pasta!

1117
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:13,252
Yes!

1118
01:30:13,741 --> 01:20:15,450
Wait, put this here.

1119
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:15,916
Wait, put this here.
