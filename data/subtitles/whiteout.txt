1
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:43,809
Anderson, P-170. I have Stetko returning.

2
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:46,786
We'll be approaching in about five.
Am I clear?

3
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:49,858
It's all you. Come on in,
the party's already started.

4
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:52,222
Isn't it a little early for that?

5
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:54,830
First big winter storm
coming in later in the week.

6
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:57,297
We're swapping personnel
a couple days early.

7
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:59,800
Roger that. See you in a few.

8
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:48,474
Attention, flight teams:

9
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:52,088
Will the following pilots
please report to station chief ASAP...

10
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,751
Stetko, where have you been?

11
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:11,798
This is a 72-hour warning, people.

12
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:16,037
That's three days until the last flight for
those of you mathematically challenged.

13
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:20,081
I'm supposed to let you know that we have
one of those season-and-safety meetings...

14
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,185
...with Dr. Cochran
before tonight's station-closing party.

15
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:26,482
Everyone must attend. 1900 in the galley.

16
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:29,421
Hold on a second,
I was just handed a piece of paper.

17
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:33,552
Sam says that bag drag
will start at 0700 on Friday.

18
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:36,962
So all your gear must be in the hallway
by 0300.

19
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:39,694
Make sure all your personal belongings...

20
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,425
For those in the winter crew
who are staying on base...

21
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:14,366
...there will be a mandatory...

22
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:05,911
Carrie?

23
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:08,684
I'm in the shower, Doc.

24
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:11,324
I'll be right out.

25
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,794
Chicken.

26
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:22,604
Shrimp?
You've been holding out on me, woman.

27
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:24,764
You wanna hear about my trip?

28
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:28,935
I flew three hours to talk to a Ph.D.
reporting the theft of a botany sample.

29
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:30,774
A botany sample?

30
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:32,210
Cannabis sativa.

31
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,783
Ah. Of course, cannabis. Weed.

32
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:37,545
Always a dull moment.

33
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:41,715
By the way, big storm's coming in,
departure's been bumped up.

34
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:44,486
Bathing suit and sunscreen
are packed and ready to go.

35
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:46,322
Well, all you need.

36
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:49,061
- Stetko? You there?
- Hold on, hold on.

37
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:54,001
- Go.
- The station manager wants to see you.

38
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:56,469
Copy. See you at dinner.

39
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,370
No, you won't. This is dinner.

40
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,704
Better than that mess-hall crap.

41
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,544
- See you on the plane.
- What? You're kidding.

42
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:07,809
- No, you heard me.
- Doc?

43
00:10:08,552 --> 00:10:11,214
We'll talk about it later, okay?

44
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:19,389
Popsicle was spotted out here
at Haworth Mesa.

45
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:21,758
Pilot I borrowed from McMurdo
called it in.

46
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:25,163
Really? What was somebody
doing out there? That's no man's land.

47
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:28,998
It's probably a weather balloon or
an old tent. It's the guy's first year here.

48
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:32,301
I know you just got back,
but he reports it, you gotta follow it up.

49
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:35,076
Okay. Don't worry, I'll go grab Doc.

50
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:36,735
Hey, Carrie.

51
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:44,581
Sam, please don't waste my time.
Just tell me how many carats.

52
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:48,721
Well, don't gush until you see it.
Then you just let it flow.

53
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:57,759
You made as much on backgammon
as you did from the Marshal Services.

54
00:10:57,935 --> 00:10:58,959
You should go pro.

55
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:02,071
Maybe that's what I'll do
when I get back to the States.

56
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,232
You're still handing in your badge, huh?

57
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:10,404
Yeah. They even have
professional backgammon players?

58
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,958
The same rules apply
to all winter-over students.

59
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:26,562
You'll have 90 days
to turn in your analysis.

60
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,723
I want proxies for the earth's
temperature changes from 1600...

61
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:33,064
...to present day.

62
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,901
Let's see how long
before they're surfing in Kansas.

63
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:42,410
Attention, South Pole:
This is a flight notification for Papa 282.

64
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:45,946
That aircraft has been delayed
and is now due at 1530.

65
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:49,108
- Doc?
- All teams, adjust your schedules.

66
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:55,023
- Good day, marshal.
- Haden, have you seen Doc?

67
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:57,524
Yeah, he's outside with the newbies.

68
00:11:57,961 --> 00:12:01,089
Hey, marshal,
don't you owe me a strip search?

69
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,392
You were the second guy out the door,
right?

70
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:06,593
Yeah.

71
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:10,132
Yeah, not interested.

72
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,441
In less than three days,
we begin the winter-over.

73
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:20,743
The sky turns black
and it stays that way for half a year.

74
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:26,145
Now, nature did not intend
for you to survive out here.

75
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,551
But here you are...

76
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:34,130
...and here I am
to teach you how not to die.

77
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:36,657
Come on.

78
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:39,127
Nothing to it.

79
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:42,302
Time.

80
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:46,435
Core body temperatures have fallen
to approximately 97 degrees.

81
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,101
Thinking is impaired.

82
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:52,515
Motor skills failing.

83
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:55,845
You are, in short, gentlemen,
well on your way to dying...

84
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,748
...and it's only been three minutes.

85
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,855
the whiteout.

86
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:08,987
An unholy set of weather conditions
converge...

87
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,260
...and the world falls away.

88
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:16,497
Winds over 100 miles an hour
skip off the ice out here...

89
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:21,042
...and kick up snow so thick you can't
see six inches in front of your face.

90
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:24,437
You can lose yourself completely
out there.

91
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,247
And be gone.

92
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:32,045
All right.

93
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:37,926
Never underestimate the ice.
Put your coats on now.

94
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,532
Now, class, give a nice,
warm South Pole hello to Marshal Stetko.

95
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,969
Hello, Marshal Stetko.

96
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:49,230
Hi, guys.

97
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:51,533
- What's up?
- I need you to take a ride with me.

98
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,176
A pilot named Delfy thinks
he may have found a body on the ice.

99
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,472
This engine is ice cold.

100
00:13:57,647 --> 00:14:01,515
You can't put the goddamn blower on for
five minutes and expect to start the plane.

101
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:06,516
What changed your mind?
I thought you were wintering over again.

102
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,251
I got a card from my granddaughter
inviting me to her 5th birthday party.

103
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:11,587
You have a granddaughter?

104
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:16,358
I have a granddaughter, Carrie,
and I've never met her.

105
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,366
I've been down here way too long.

106
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:22,000
- You Delfy?
- Last I remember.

107
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:24,140
I'm Stetko. This is John Fury.

108
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:27,333
- Are you old enough to fly this thing?
- Certainly hope so.

109
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:31,245
Just try not to have a heart attack
on my plane, junior.

110
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:34,410
Smartass.

111
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:37,753
Well, I think I'm gonna like him.

112
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:45,926
ASB, ASB, come in.

113
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:49,429
This is November 178.
I'm five minutes out from Haworth Mesa.

114
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,191
How's the weather? Over.

115
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:53,302
Weather is clear.

116
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,268
Roger, ASB.
I'll inform you on turnaround.

117
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:01,000
You asleep?

118
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:02,372
Yep.

119
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:09,648
I could fly down here the rest of my life
and never get used to how beautiful it is.

120
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,404
How did he get here?

121
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:14,917
Maybe he was climbing,
fell from up there.

122
00:16:15,952 --> 00:16:17,783
Then where's his gear?

123
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:20,279
It doesn't make any sense.

124
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,921
How could he be all the way out here
without any gear?

125
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:37,240
He's a sticker. Give me a hand.

126
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:45,279
Okay.

127
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,046
Go.

128
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:13,074
Carrie?

129
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:16,605
Are you all right?

130
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:18,512
Yeah.

131
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:21,149
Let's see who he is.

132
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:24,878
Weiss.

133
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:29,152
Weiss. Yeah, I knew him.

134
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:33,854
Yeah, we wintered with him last year,
played cards a couple times.

135
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:38,228
- He's the one that cheated.
- The geologist.

136
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:39,891
Yeah.

137
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,799
Damn. Damn, damn.

138
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:48,636
What were you doing
all the way out here?

139
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:03,219
- Watch this.
- Yes.

140
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:05,160
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

141
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:07,756
Got it.

142
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:11,259
- Million-year-old ice, right?
- Yes.

143
00:18:14,804 --> 00:18:17,136
- Ten-year-old whiskey. Yeah?
- Ten-year-old whiskey.

144
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,168
This is cool.

145
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,118
Out of the way.

146
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:42,431
Ugh!

147
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,559
Move it!

148
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:48,070
Out of the way.

149
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:57,679
It bothers me that nobody's
reported him missing yet.

150
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:59,838
Maybe no one thinks he is.

151
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:11,186
What's this?

152
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:24,032
Well, let's find out.

153
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:40,116
It's a fresh wound.

154
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:43,291
- Somebody treated him in the field.
- Yeah.

155
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,655
And they were in a hurry.

156
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,999
What's happened up here?

157
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:08,480
Oh, my God.

158
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:12,951
What could have caused that?

159
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:16,121
Rough edges around the wound.

160
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,420
Ice ax, something like that.

161
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:25,292
So we got a geologist
out at Haworth Mesa.

162
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:27,595
He injures his leg, has it stitched...

163
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:30,069
...then manages to climb
a 100-foot ice wall...

164
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,903
...falls onto his own ax, which isn't
found anywhere near the body?

165
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:36,671
Doc, this wasn't an accident.

166
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:40,980
This means a federal investigation.

167
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:42,846
We're witnesses.

168
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:46,883
I know you wanna get out of here, Carrie,
and the last plane leaves in two days.

169
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,453
We could be stuck here for the winter.

170
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:53,054
Can you handle that?

171
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:54,963
No.

172
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,498
I mean, God, I don't know.

173
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:03,395
Say the word, I'll bag the body,
put it on the plane for McMurdo.

174
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:05,404
Let them sort it out. No big deal.

175
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,886
I won't take no for an answer, Jack.

176
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:26,386
I have plans Saturday.

177
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:29,964
Microwave popcorn and a six-pack
is not plans. We're clear.

178
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:31,259
Go.

179
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:36,338
How we doing? Good.

180
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,304
Why don't you get some sleep?
You earned it.

181
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:42,701
That was all you today.

182
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,079
Carrie.

183
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:47,711
So it was a popsicle.

184
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:51,945
But please, next time you find a dead body,
don't parade him down the corridor.

185
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:53,520
Sam, he was murdered.

186
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:57,552
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

187
00:21:57,727 --> 00:22:00,787
His name was Weiss.
He was one of ours. We gotta call it in.

188
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:03,488
Yeah.

189
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:06,633
See how the FBI wants to handle it.

190
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:11,034
- What camp's he with?
- I don't know. I gotta talk to McGuire.

191
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:15,940
131, confirming to
instruct Departure 133.0, Squad 4233.

192
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:18,205
Anton Weiss.

193
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:22,743
Michael Rubin. John Mooney.

194
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,380
- What do they do at that camp?
- One One is an ablation zone.

195
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:30,853
- English?
- It's a good place to find meteorites.

196
00:22:31,027 --> 00:22:32,961
It's right there.

197
00:22:33,663 --> 00:22:36,291
Well, Weiss was nowhere near that camp
when we found him.

198
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:38,525
Wait a minute. Weiss?

199
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:42,603
A few days ago, someone
from Delta-One One called, looking for him.

200
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:44,899
I asked around, but nobody had seen him.

201
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:48,976
Didn't you think it was odd that they called
here looking for one of their own guys?

202
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:50,271
Not at the time.

203
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:53,539
Was that the last communication you had
with that camp?

204
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:55,149
Let me see.

205
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:05,126
What's their frequency?

206
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:08,694
11553.

207
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,969
Delta-One One, South Pole, this is
United States Marshal Carrie Stetko, over.

208
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:21,276
Delta-One One, South Pole,
this is United States Marshal Stetko.

209
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:23,378
How copy? Over.

210
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:27,677
Let me see the log.

211
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,977
Carrie Stetko, please call Comm at 282.

212
00:23:35,158 --> 00:23:37,092
- Stetko.
- Marshal, it's Jamie.

213
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,125
I've got some guy holding from Vostok.

214
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:41,763
He won't give his name.
He says he has to talk to you.

215
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:44,456
Vostok? All right, patch him through.

216
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:46,124
You're on now.

217
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:48,566
This is Marshal Stetko. Who is this?

218
00:23:48,738 --> 00:23:50,797
This is John Mooney, marshal.

219
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:52,441
What happened out there, Mooney?

220
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:53,973
You know who I am?

221
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:57,037
- Come in and let's talk.
- No.

222
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,340
I can't come in.
You have to come to Vostok.

223
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,010
Only you.

224
00:24:02,185 --> 00:24:05,552
- Why would I want to go to Vostok?
- Just come to Vostok. Please.

225
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,119
Look, I got a better idea.
I'll send a plane. You come here.

226
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:12,853
Just come to Vostok
and you'll understand everything.

227
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,436
Rhonda,
we have a real situation developing.

228
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:35,550
This storm is coming in fast,
10 hours earlier than we first calculated.

229
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:38,116
Fly eight runs?

230
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:40,983
Sorry, guys. We need to put up
as many planes as possible.

231
00:24:41,157 --> 00:24:43,250
What is this, Top Gun?

232
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:46,990
How am I supposed to make eight runs
on three hours' sleep?

233
00:24:47,163 --> 00:24:50,030
by the skin of your teeth.

234
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:54,091
- Rhonda, I need a plane to Vostok.
- Good luck. All my planes are committed.

235
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,795
Pullouts are completely screwed
because of this front.

236
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,838
I need Delfy.

237
00:24:59,742 --> 00:25:01,937
Rhonda, I'm not asking.

238
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:04,273
Listen up, all personnel.

239
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:08,440
The expected storm is now calculated
to arrive 10 hours earlier.

240
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:11,212
New evac timetable
has therefore been accelerated.

241
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,412
All personnel will be on the tarmac...

242
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:16,387
- ...10 hours before previous embarkation.
- Why don't you get sleep?

243
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,753
You earned it.

244
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:20,122
That was all you today.

245
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:36,677
Jack!

246
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:38,744
Jack!

247
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:42,575
This is a station-wide announcement:

248
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:45,482
All department heads
must attend a meeting at 1900 hours...

249
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:48,954
..to discuss the updated evac schedule.
This meeting is mandatory.

250
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,490
Whoa, what's going on?

251
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:54,363
So I'm in McGuire's office.
One of Weiss's missing team members calls.

252
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,589
- Which one?
- Mooney.

253
00:25:56,766 --> 00:25:58,324
Yeah, I heard of him.

254
00:25:59,702 --> 00:26:02,330
Anyway, he's at Vostok,
the old Russian base.

255
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:04,964
I thought they already evac'd
for the winter.

256
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:07,803
Far as I know, they did.
He wouldn't talk over the phone.

257
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:09,672
Who's on your wing?

258
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:12,176
Delfy. I'll be fine.

259
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:15,181
You will be fine or you are fine?

260
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:21,919
Now, that's the same look you had
when you first came into my office.

261
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:24,787
That's not true. I had a great tan then.

262
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:27,327
Carrie, it's Delfy. You there?

263
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:30,623
- Go.
- All fueled up and clear skies...

264
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,961
...with a balmy minus-50.
Ready when you are.

265
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:34,728
That will be now.

266
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:39,633
You know how I feel?

267
00:26:42,845 --> 00:26:44,176
Frustrated.

268
00:26:44,347 --> 00:26:47,145
I've been down here for two years,
dealing with misdemeanors.

269
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:50,683
Mindless, simple.
No thinking, no problem.

270
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:52,377
That was the plan, and it worked.

271
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:55,915
- I thought I was past it.
- Miami.

272
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:58,022
Yeah. Ever since I saw Weiss's body...

273
00:26:58,194 --> 00:27:02,324
...it's been like 85 degrees
and 80 percent humidity.

274
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:05,023
Yeah, well, time is irrelevant.

275
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:08,899
That's why they invented Scotch.

276
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:12,438
- There are now only 56 hours...
- Have a good trip.

277
00:27:12,608 --> 00:27:15,270
- ...left for all personnel on the winter fly out.
- Thanks.

278
00:27:15,444 --> 00:27:17,674
Be sure that you begin
your preparations on time.

279
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:43,294
- We really ought to get back to base.
- There's one more building to check.

280
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:48,339
It's really dropping out there.
You sure you want to do this?

281
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:50,911
Sure you want to be there
when I open this door?

282
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:59,437
Mooney? It's Carrie Stetko.

283
00:29:07,957 --> 00:29:09,447
Mooney?

284
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:16,598
Mooney?

285
00:29:24,874 --> 00:29:26,205
Mooney?

286
00:30:05,815 --> 00:30:07,146
Shit.

287
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:30,788
Aah!

288
00:31:58,727 --> 00:32:00,126
Ooh!

289
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,565
Oh.

290
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:19,040
Why don't you get some sleep?
You earned it.

291
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:37,296
Jack!

292
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:39,995
- Jack!
- Hey, Carrie. Carrie, it's me.

293
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:43,037
You're okay. Carrie, it's me.
It's okay.

294
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,300
Hey, hey, Carrie. Hey, Carrie.

295
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:47,737
It's me, it's Delfy.

296
00:32:49,745 --> 00:32:51,269
You're okay.

297
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:54,279
You all right? You with me?

298
00:32:55,217 --> 00:32:56,775
You're okay.

299
00:32:59,221 --> 00:33:02,418
I found you in the ready room
half-conscious. I carried you here.

300
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,220
You've been out ever since.

301
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,099
Mooney's dead.

302
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:15,968
There was a man.
He... He killed Mooney.

303
00:33:16,138 --> 00:33:17,628
And he tried to kill me too.

304
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:20,698
He must still be here somewhere.

305
00:33:22,945 --> 00:33:24,412
How's your chin?

306
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:26,579
It's better than your hand.

307
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:30,875
How bad?

308
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:33,811
Bad enough you don't wanna see.

309
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:36,890
I gotta get back out there.

310
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:05,982
Hey. Let me see your hands.

311
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:08,123
- Hit the lights.
- Right.

312
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,090
- Who are you?
- Relax. I've got ID.

313
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:13,828
Where are the lights?

314
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,357
Get that light out of my face now.

315
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:18,693
Robert Pryce?

316
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:22,127
I'm with the U.N.
Special Investigations Division.

317
00:34:22,304 --> 00:34:23,771
Got it.

318
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,265
I went to Pole
to talk to you about Weiss.

319
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:30,310
- How do you know about Weiss?
- FBI notified us.

320
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:32,874
Your base commander, Murphy,
called it in.

321
00:34:33,048 --> 00:34:35,209
I was dropped here
after the weather cleared.

322
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:38,547
Been here for a few hours,
thought I'd let you two sleep.

323
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,151
You mind lowering that gun?

324
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:46,390
Mind telling me why the U.N.'s
interested in the murder of a geologist?

325
00:34:46,762 --> 00:34:48,195
This isn't just a murder.

326
00:34:48,364 --> 00:34:50,332
This is the first murder in Antarctica...

327
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:53,991
...and now our second. I don't
have to tell you how sensitive this is.

328
00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:57,332
We don't want this to become
an international issue.

329
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,406
- Right.
- U.N. wants our eyes on the ground...

330
00:35:00,576 --> 00:35:02,908
...someone to track it,
control the information.

331
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:05,808
- And that's you?
- That's me.

332
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,010
It's late. We better get to Delta-One One
while the weather holds.

333
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,086
Wait. I don't need your help.

334
00:35:13,455 --> 00:35:16,015
I can see we're getting off
to a really good start here.

335
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:18,489
You don't want to share your toys.
I can do that.

336
00:35:19,662 --> 00:35:22,654
Like I can say, I'm within my rights
to commandeer your plane...

337
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,924
...and your pilot if I have to.

338
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:29,497
He can.

339
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:35,604
It's your choice.

340
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:46,880
You got to Pole awfully fast.

341
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:50,890
I was in McMurdo when the call came in.

342
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:54,160
You didn't get a look at the guy
who came after you?

343
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:58,026
Yeah, 6 feet, 175,
ECW gear head-to-toe.

344
00:35:58,434 --> 00:35:59,696
Sound like anyone you know?

345
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:02,398
I got there after the whiteout.

346
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,668
So you say.

347
00:36:07,976 --> 00:36:09,807
Oh, jeez.

348
00:36:10,512 --> 00:36:12,707
Haven't acclimated yet.

349
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:19,579
Well, if you were in McMurdo,
you weren't there long.

350
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:22,785
We're on approach. Buckle up.

351
00:36:23,692 --> 00:36:25,489
ASB, this is November 178.

352
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:29,222
I'm landing at camp Delta-One One with
Marshal Stetko and Agent Robert Pryce.

353
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:31,798
Can you give me an update?

354
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:35,595
November 178, there's been no
significant change in the approaching system.

355
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:38,331
I'll keep you updated
if anything develops.

356
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,941
Roger, ASB.
We'll inform you on turnaround.

357
00:37:01,663 --> 00:37:04,757
- Be careful around him.
- Right.

358
00:37:42,504 --> 00:37:44,404
Here's a map of their work site.

359
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:49,869
They searched it in a grid pattern.

360
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:52,811
Looks like they stopped on grid 104.

361
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:56,107
I've only been out here
a couple of months...

362
00:37:56,451 --> 00:38:00,319
...but when did det cord and blasting caps
become standard issue for geology camps?

363
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:02,586
There's gotta be 40 pounds of plastic.

364
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:04,848
What the hell were they doing?

365
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:08,519
They were supposed to be searching
for meteorites on the surface.

366
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:14,029
We better head out there.

367
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:31,978
You seem to know
your high explosives, Delfy.

368
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:34,679
I learned to recognize them pretty quick.

369
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:36,586
Karbala?

370
00:38:36,758 --> 00:38:38,589
Baghdad. Support runs. You?

371
00:38:39,895 --> 00:38:41,522
Somewhere in the same region, yeah.

372
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:45,965
Well, my friend, it looks like
we just traded one desert for another.

373
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:49,533
But one hell of a lot colder.

374
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:05,449
So how we doing?

375
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:08,289
- We're almost there.
- Good.

376
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:13,090
How does ex-military wind up down here
working for the U.N.?

377
00:39:13,262 --> 00:39:14,456
It was an open post.

378
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:20,300
So really, how does a U.S. Marshal like you
end up in Antarctica?

379
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,631
Open post.

380
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,507
We're here.

381
00:39:38,987 --> 00:39:40,818
There's nothing here.

382
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:44,018
Let's head back.

383
00:39:55,804 --> 00:39:57,362
You sure this is right?

384
00:39:57,539 --> 00:39:59,564
Section 104. These are the coordinates.

385
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:01,834
Maybe you wrote it down wrong.

386
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:15,350
This ice has been worked.

387
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:22,191
They were digging here.

388
00:40:22,364 --> 00:40:25,959
Looks like they spread the ice out
to cover whatever they found.

389
00:40:28,937 --> 00:40:30,461
Marshal!

390
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,970
Stetko!

391
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:35,202
- Stetko!
- Marshal!

392
00:40:35,777 --> 00:40:37,005
- Marshal.
- Uhn.

393
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,371
You okay?

394
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:41,542
Just sit tight.

395
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:44,743
I saw a rope in the Cat.

396
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:49,515
If you're hurt, try not to move.

397
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:04,062
Watch the rope.

398
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:07,032
Okay, I'm coming down.

399
00:41:27,462 --> 00:41:29,953
Guess they found
what they were looking for.

400
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:38,337
What the hell happened here?

401
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:40,634
You see all that blood behind us?

402
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:42,299
Yes, I did.

403
00:41:59,861 --> 00:42:01,795
It's a cargo plane.

404
00:42:03,298 --> 00:42:04,458
Is it American?

405
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:09,434
No, I don't think so.
But whatever it is, it's an antique.

406
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,574
How long do you think
this has been here?

407
00:42:15,644 --> 00:42:17,134
Russian vodka.

408
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:21,948
Could be an Antonov An-12.
These things haven't flown for 50 years.

409
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:28,079
Oh, my God.

410
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:30,622
- What? What is it?
- It's a body.

411
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:40,431
Looks like he's been shot in the head.

412
00:42:44,406 --> 00:42:45,873
Here's another.

413
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,343
We got another one over here.

414
00:42:57,586 --> 00:43:01,249
- Why is one of the pilots back here?
- Who knows?

415
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,575
We really should be heading back.

416
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:30,207
Stetko.

417
00:43:56,578 --> 00:43:59,945
Well, that would explain
how they crashed.

418
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:01,839
They were in the air.

419
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:06,249
Pilot stayed at the stick while the copilot
went back to take out the passengers.

420
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:12,258
He must have surprised the
first guard, but missed the others.

421
00:44:13,628 --> 00:44:18,065
And the other guards returned fire
on the copilot. Bang, bang.

422
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:23,599
The guards and the copilot take each
other out, and the pilot caught a stray.

423
00:44:28,977 --> 00:44:32,276
Ice swallows them whole. Jesus.

424
00:44:33,381 --> 00:44:34,643
But over what?

425
00:44:38,286 --> 00:44:39,548
Where's Pryce?

426
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:42,083
What have you found?

427
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:44,850
Nothing. We're too late.

428
00:44:46,494 --> 00:44:47,927
Be careful.

429
00:44:49,264 --> 00:44:52,665
Oh, God. Looks like fresh blood.

430
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:54,967
It's gotta be Weiss's.

431
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:01,804
Weiss had an injury to his leg.

432
00:45:03,278 --> 00:45:05,838
He must have cut it
getting into this box.

433
00:45:06,615 --> 00:45:09,516
Whatever was in there
was what they were after.

434
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:12,481
That's his blood in the shaft.

435
00:45:12,821 --> 00:45:15,153
He left a trail as they dragged him out.

436
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:17,418
Right.

437
00:45:21,529 --> 00:45:23,963
You're not surprised by any of this.

438
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,234
You knew this was here.

439
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,267
Talk to me, Pryce.

440
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:36,534
Two days ago...

441
00:45:37,212 --> 00:45:40,841
...someone down here contacted
an arms dealer on the watch list.

442
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:45,916
He was arranging the sale of six canisters
recovered from an old Soviet transport.

443
00:45:46,087 --> 00:45:48,715
- Containing what?
- We're not sure.

444
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:51,154
During the '50s,
the Soviets mined down here...

445
00:45:51,326 --> 00:45:54,295
...for material to use
in their nuclear program.

446
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:56,930
If that's what the geologists found
in this box...

447
00:45:57,098 --> 00:45:59,225
...and it makes its way
onto the open market...

448
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:02,199
- Why didn't you tell me any of this before?
- I wasn't sure...

449
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,361
...if your murders and my canisters
were connected.

450
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:05,665
Oh, they're connected.

451
00:46:07,776 --> 00:46:09,141
You hear that?

452
00:46:28,096 --> 00:46:30,621
We're gonna run out of air
long before anyone finds us.

453
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:33,233
Yeah, that's if
we don't freeze to death first.

454
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:47,171
Anything?

455
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,149
No.

456
00:46:50,885 --> 00:46:51,943
Great.

457
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:57,355
Well, it looks like we're gonna
have to dig ourselves out of here.

458
00:46:57,892 --> 00:47:01,453
With what?
That ice has got to be 20 feet deep.

459
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:04,355
Just trying to keep it upbeat.

460
00:47:05,066 --> 00:47:06,533
Nobody knows we're down here.

461
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:10,003
Yeah. Thanks for reminding me.

462
00:47:21,149 --> 00:47:23,413
Don't make them like that anymore.

463
00:47:29,991 --> 00:47:33,051
Let's hope Captain America over there
has got a plan.

464
00:47:33,828 --> 00:47:37,992
The backup oxygen's empty,
must have been damaged in the crash.

465
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:40,062
Oh, great.

466
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,403
- Hey.
- Yeah?

467
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:51,909
You think when that guy boarded this plane,
he had any idea he'd end up like this?

468
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:59,442
- Oh, my God.
- What?

469
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:04,655
That's why Weiss wasn't wearing
any ECW gear when we found him.

470
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:07,693
That's why there was no ax
found near the body.

471
00:48:08,863 --> 00:48:11,127
Wait, wait, wait, you're losing me.

472
00:48:11,399 --> 00:48:14,391
The only way in or out of Vostok
is by plane...

473
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:17,265
...which means the killer
had to have access to one.

474
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:19,839
That's why Weiss was so busted up.

475
00:48:20,008 --> 00:48:22,169
You think that's why
he was at Haworth Mesa?

476
00:48:22,343 --> 00:48:25,471
Yeah, I think somebody killed him
and dropped him out of a plane.

477
00:48:34,689 --> 00:48:38,056
This little revelation doesn't happen
to come with an escape plan, does it?

478
00:48:39,427 --> 00:48:40,451
We're fucked.

479
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,806
Listen, Delfy, I've been thinking.
Does this plane have a main-hold bail out?

480
00:48:55,977 --> 00:48:59,310
Yeah, it's usually on the ceiling,
in case of an ocean landing.

481
00:49:00,682 --> 00:49:02,081
Here.

482
00:49:05,053 --> 00:49:06,714
Explosive bolts.

483
00:49:08,223 --> 00:49:11,090
We blow the hatch,
we punch a hole through the ice.

484
00:49:11,593 --> 00:49:14,585
At this angle, the surface can't
be more than 10 feet above us.

485
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:17,458
No, no, no. Whoa,
you're asking a lot of 60-year-old bolts.

486
00:49:17,632 --> 00:49:20,658
If the ice is too thick,
the blast will come right back on us.

487
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:24,601
We can blow ourselves up, suffocate,
or freeze to death. You take your pick.

488
00:49:25,874 --> 00:49:27,205
Do it.

489
00:49:31,212 --> 00:49:33,009
We need a power source.

490
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:36,480
Here, there may be enough juice
left in the SAT-phone battery.

491
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:38,118
Oh, that's smart.

492
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:39,913
Come on, it's cold.

493
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,494
You guys might want to take some cover.

494
00:49:57,071 --> 00:49:58,732
Fire in the hole.

495
00:50:14,155 --> 00:50:16,316
Oh, that's beautiful.

496
00:50:16,491 --> 00:50:19,392
Now let's stack these crates
and get the hell out of here.

497
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,833
Carrie! Delfy! Come on!

498
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:40,115
Okay, let's hope
we have enough juice left to start it.

499
00:50:45,088 --> 00:50:46,487
Come on.

500
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:56,025
Oh, fuck. All right, all right.
Let's just let it sit for a second.

501
00:51:00,837 --> 00:51:04,329
Oh, don't.
It'll lower your core temperature.

502
00:51:10,914 --> 00:51:12,848
All right. Give me some of that.

503
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:17,049
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought.

504
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:32,161
Crazy.

505
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,631
I understand a bunch of Cold War Russians
killing each other over that box...

506
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:39,867
...but how did three Ph. D's
get wrapped up in some shit like this?

507
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:42,238
It's this place. Try it again.

508
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:45,506
Come on, baby.

509
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:47,681
Yes.

510
00:51:56,093 --> 00:51:58,425
Attention, the transport plane...

511
00:51:58,595 --> 00:52:02,691
...will arrive at 0900 hours for anyone
who is not staying on base for the winter.

512
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:06,199
Bag drag must be completed two hours
prior to wheels up.

513
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:07,768
All gear, equipment...

514
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:11,339
- You need to get your hand checked out.
- I will.

515
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:12,941
Failure to do so will result

516
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:19,344
I'm gonna update my office
and tell them what we found.

517
00:52:20,183 --> 00:52:21,946
You're not listening to me, Bill.

518
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:24,849
Look, I've already got two bodies
on my hands...

519
00:52:25,021 --> 00:52:27,319
...and God knows what
stolen from a Russian plane.

520
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:28,856
I know, it's a bad situation.

521
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:31,118
I wanna evac the base. No winter-overs.

522
00:52:31,294 --> 00:52:33,262
Evac the base?
I'm not sure we can do that.

523
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:36,558
- I have to call you back.
- You're pulling everybody off the ice?

524
00:52:36,733 --> 00:52:39,725
I can't take the chance
of having my people stranded down here...

525
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:42,804
...with this guy running around.
- Don't think I can do my job?

526
00:52:42,973 --> 00:52:44,804
That's not what I said.

527
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:48,777
Any calls on Rubin?

528
00:52:48,945 --> 00:52:52,176
No, but we've got his face out
to all bases.

529
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:53,407
Fine, thanks.

530
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:55,575
Carrie.

531
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:57,743
Attention, all personnel:

532
00:52:57,921 --> 00:53:01,049
The station manager has just informed me
of a change in schedule.

533
00:53:01,224 --> 00:53:03,920
Due to recent incidents,
the base is going into lockdown...

534
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:06,221
...for the duration of the winter season.

535
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,560
This includes all international
science teams.

536
00:53:12,736 --> 00:53:14,704
Repeat, this is a mandatory...

537
00:53:17,307 --> 00:53:19,002
All are required to depart on the plane.

538
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:20,200
What the hell?

539
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:22,402
- No one will be wintering over.
- Carrie.

540
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,446
It's not that you aren't capable
of handling this.

541
00:53:26,616 --> 00:53:30,484
- I'm just trying to keep my people safe.
- Sam, when I examined Weiss...

542
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:32,622
...his core wasn't frozen solid yet...

543
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:36,156
...so his body can only have been out
in Haworth Mesa for a day, at most.

544
00:53:36,326 --> 00:53:38,658
- Yeah?
- So I'm searching the flight logs...

545
00:53:38,828 --> 00:53:43,288
...to see which pilots were in the air hours
before he was found. This is what I got.

546
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:46,702
Doesn't make any sense.

547
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,840
Sam, Weiss's body
was thrown from a plane.

548
00:53:53,009 --> 00:53:56,501
Whoever flew it is trying to cover
their tracks. I gotta talk to the pilots.

549
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,172
Look, they're out evac'ing camps.
We're wheels up in less than 20 hours.

550
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,113
Shit.

551
00:54:02,285 --> 00:54:03,912
What happened to your hand?

552
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:05,816
I lost my glove.

553
00:54:05,989 --> 00:54:09,220
Look, I'm gonna go to channel six.
Radio me when the pilots come back.

554
00:54:09,392 --> 00:54:12,589
- Take care of that hand, okay?
- Please report any contact with...

555
00:54:12,762 --> 00:54:15,731
Keeping these people safe
is supposed to be my job.

556
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:20,994
He's wanted for questioning in connection
with recent incidents...

557
00:54:21,171 --> 00:54:22,638
...and is considered dangerous.

558
00:54:22,806 --> 00:54:28,039
Repeat, please report any sightings
of Michael Rubin to the station manager.

559
00:54:33,984 --> 00:54:35,383
How long since you last slept?

560
00:54:36,953 --> 00:54:38,477
Oh, I don't know.

561
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:41,515
Oh, my God.

562
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,475
You feel that?

563
00:55:01,645 --> 00:55:03,875
- Report to the station manager's office...
- No.

564
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:05,571
...for final checkout...

565
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:07,544
Now?

566
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:14,456
Nothing?

567
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,565
I'm gonna have to amputate
these fingers.

568
00:55:25,735 --> 00:55:28,033
- No. no way.
- They're dead, Carrie.

569
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:32,072
If I don't do it now,
infection will set in.

570
00:55:32,776 --> 00:55:34,607
You'll lose your hand.

571
00:55:38,648 --> 00:55:40,479
Sorry, kid.

572
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:44,443
I'm so sorry.

573
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:58,829
How ironic. Our last days here...

574
00:55:59,769 --> 00:56:01,930
...and both of our jobs
get so complicated.

575
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,776
Guess I'm your warm-up
for when you get home.

576
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:10,178
You okay?

577
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:16,916
You're gonna practice
back in Chicago, aren't you?

578
00:56:20,423 --> 00:56:23,984
I'm just gonna go back
and focus on my granddaughter.

579
00:56:26,162 --> 00:56:29,461
Don't see kids down here too often.
You forget what they're like.

580
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,795
And dogs.

581
00:56:33,903 --> 00:56:34,927
Trees.

582
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:40,605
Still, there's a few things I'll miss.

583
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:44,112
Like what? The zero humidity?
The color gray?

584
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:47,716
Winter '06, radio-darts championship.

585
00:56:49,085 --> 00:56:50,985
We spanked Norway.

586
00:56:51,154 --> 00:56:52,280
Yes, we did.

587
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:56,285
Two winters together, Doc.

588
00:56:59,729 --> 00:57:01,822
It wasn't all bad.

589
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,559
It wasn't all bad.

590
00:57:14,944 --> 00:57:16,536
Are you okay?

591
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,254
You're doing great, kid.

592
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:28,581
We're halfway there.

593
00:57:40,537 --> 00:57:42,437
Thirty-two. Knots dropped down...

594
00:57:42,605 --> 00:57:44,095
Knots dropped down...

595
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,975
Sixteen, 16...

596
00:57:47,811 --> 00:57:50,245
Cloud cover is now at 10,000 feet.

597
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:53,915
Attention, South Pole:

598
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:57,712
The storm is now approximately
only 500 miles from the station.

599
00:57:57,887 --> 00:57:59,946
Please commence
runway-clearance protocols...

600
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:02,523
...in anticipation
of the transport planes arriving.

601
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:05,286
Will flight crews please begin
clearing off the runway?

602
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:07,896
Shit. Fuck. Aah! Aah.

603
00:58:09,532 --> 00:58:11,932
way in the next five hours.

604
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:17,730
Not now.

605
00:58:21,444 --> 00:58:24,777
- Attention, all personnel:
- I stopped by the clinic.

606
00:58:25,348 --> 00:58:26,940
Doc told me.

607
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:30,649
Pretty tough marshal, huh?

608
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:36,926
Well, I don't know.
You were pretty tough on me.

609
00:58:38,127 --> 00:58:39,924
I needed to know if I could trust you.

610
00:58:41,431 --> 00:58:42,796
Badge didn't do it, huh?

611
00:58:45,768 --> 00:58:47,429
A badge is just a badge.

612
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:54,900
What happened to you, Carrie?

613
00:58:56,145 --> 00:58:57,578
Why are you down here, really?

614
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:07,949
There was this case
my partner and I were working.

615
00:59:09,092 --> 00:59:10,923
Drug trafficker.

616
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:13,961
After months of work,
we'd finally nailed this guy.

617
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,188
That was all you today.

618
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:17,657
Why don't you get some sleep?
You earned it.

619
00:59:17,834 --> 00:59:20,166
I was feeling so good.

620
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:25,701
I woke up, and I got this bad feeling.

621
00:59:30,146 --> 00:59:31,374
Sorry, we woke you.

622
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:33,482
No, it's too hot to sleep.

623
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,049
But everything seemed fine.

624
00:59:35,218 --> 00:59:38,210
- You wanna take over?
- Sure, just give me a second.

625
00:59:54,437 --> 00:59:55,495
Jack?

626
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:59,631
My first thought was for my partner.
Was he hurt?

627
01:00:04,047 --> 01:00:06,641
Emergency traffic,
prisoner escape in progress.

628
01:00:06,816 --> 01:00:09,683
He got away from us.
My partner is down. Repeat...

629
01:00:10,386 --> 01:00:12,820
Suddenly, I was in a nightmare.

630
01:00:17,694 --> 01:00:18,718
You son of a bitch.

631
01:00:20,296 --> 01:00:22,161
How much to let him escape?

632
01:00:22,332 --> 01:00:24,596
- Carrie.
- To let him kill me?

633
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:27,262
How much?

634
01:00:28,938 --> 01:00:30,235
Hell of a lot.

635
01:00:34,243 --> 01:00:35,710
Okay.

636
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:38,340
I know this is bad.

637
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:40,345
But listen to me.

638
01:00:40,817 --> 01:00:42,114
Please.

639
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:44,110
Carrie.

640
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:03,601
I killed him.

641
01:01:06,442 --> 01:01:08,069
He gave you no choice.

642
01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:12,007
No.

643
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:15,810
But what I can't get away from
is that...

644
01:01:15,985 --> 01:01:20,217
...Jack had turned
and I didn't have a clue.

645
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:26,460
And if I missed that,
then maybe I just don't have it.

646
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:32,729
From what I've seen,
you haven't missed a beat.

647
01:01:34,237 --> 01:01:37,138
And if you've really given up
on yourself...

648
01:01:37,306 --> 01:01:40,537
...you would've turned your badge in
a long time ago, but you haven't.

649
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:44,237
So you come down here
in the worst marshal's post on the planet...

650
01:01:44,647 --> 01:01:46,137
...to what?

651
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,681
Punish yourself.

652
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:51,513
Okay, well, you've done that.

653
01:01:52,722 --> 01:01:57,386
But you're better than this,
and I think you know that.

654
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,097
Let me help you.

655
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:20,072
Carrie, do you copy?

656
01:02:25,121 --> 01:02:27,681
- Yeah.
- Rubin's just been spotted on the base.

657
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:30,018
- Where?
- He just left the Science Building.

658
01:02:30,193 --> 01:02:31,490
Great.

659
01:02:32,428 --> 01:02:34,328
Updated weather tracking shows...

660
01:02:34,497 --> 01:02:36,829
- ...that this is a Category 4 storm.
- I'm right behind you.

661
01:02:37,266 --> 01:02:40,724
I've been informed there are personnel
securing their workstations.

662
01:02:41,738 --> 01:02:45,538
You have only three hours to complete
all work and winterize the science station.

663
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:50,077
Repeat, you have three hours. We're gonna
cut it close, people, so please move it.

664
01:02:50,613 --> 01:02:51,705
Rubin?

665
01:02:52,949 --> 01:02:54,644
What happened out there?

666
01:02:58,821 --> 01:03:00,550
I know about the plane.

667
01:03:05,328 --> 01:03:06,818
Rubin, it's okay.

668
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:08,896
Talk to me.

669
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:16,735
We were out looking for meteor samples.

670
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:20,601
We'd found nothing for weeks.

671
01:03:20,877 --> 01:03:25,576
And then, the radar went off the charts.
We hit something big.

672
01:03:26,115 --> 01:03:28,208
We debated what it could be.

673
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:31,717
We came back to base
to report what we'd found.

674
01:03:31,888 --> 01:03:35,346
That's when we heard the story
about the lost Russian plane.

675
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:39,391
Instead of filing the report,
we went back out there.

676
01:03:39,562 --> 01:03:42,759
We blasted our way through the ice
and found the plane...

677
01:03:45,134 --> 01:03:46,601
...with that goddamn box.

678
01:03:48,604 --> 01:03:51,767
- Aah!
- Weiss tore up his leg getting into it.

679
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:54,875
He was losing a lot of blood.

680
01:03:55,044 --> 01:03:56,978
We tried to stop the bleeding.

681
01:03:57,146 --> 01:04:01,674
We were afraid to move him,
so I radioed for help.

682
01:04:02,451 --> 01:04:06,410
The plan was for him to call us when he
got to Pole to let us know he was okay.

683
01:04:08,224 --> 01:04:10,124
Mooney was right.

684
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:13,394
- He said we couldn't trust him.
- Trust who? Who's after you?

685
01:04:15,264 --> 01:04:16,595
Carrie?

686
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:27,938
Stop him! Somebody stop him!

687
01:04:36,419 --> 01:04:38,819
Please, let me help you. Rubin.

688
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:57,102
Rubin, open the door.

689
01:04:58,307 --> 01:05:00,605
Open the door. Rubin.

690
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:31,570
Help!

691
01:05:31,741 --> 01:05:34,369
Wait. Wait. Wait. Help!

692
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:40,740
Help me! Help me!

693
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:49,682
Help me!

694
01:06:11,414 --> 01:06:15,475
Carrie. It's okay, you got him.
You got him.

695
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:21,588
I've already told you.
My name is Russell Haden.

696
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:24,926
I'm an Australian citizen.

697
01:06:25,094 --> 01:06:27,562
And I demand to speak
with my consulate.

698
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:31,700
- He say anything more?
- Same chorus.

699
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:34,767
For a guy who's going down
for a triple homicide...

700
01:06:34,937 --> 01:06:37,235
...I think you'd be interested
in helping us out.

701
01:06:37,406 --> 01:06:39,169
What did you find in that plane?

702
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,433
So, marshal.

703
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:42,739
Remember the strip search you owe me?

704
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:46,879
I reckon you'd be good for it now
that you're missing a couple of parts.

705
01:06:47,049 --> 01:06:48,573
Pryce.

706
01:06:48,918 --> 01:06:50,783
Attention, all base personnel:

707
01:06:50,953 --> 01:06:53,114
Good news.
A transport plane has just landed.

708
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:58,493
Hey, hey, hey! You son of a bitch.
Take your fucking hands off me.

709
01:06:58,661 --> 01:07:01,789
- You got a foul mouth, mate.
- I'm not your fucking mate, all right?

710
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:07,964
My name's Russell Haden.
I'm an Australian citizen.

711
01:07:11,774 --> 01:07:14,174
Let's see how cute you are
with a few parts missing.

712
01:07:14,343 --> 01:07:16,140
All right, all right, all right!

713
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:19,279
We know you flew out to 104
to help Weiss.

714
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:21,973
What did you do with the canisters, huh?

715
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:23,846
Where did you hide them?

716
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:26,989
They're in my gear.
I hid them in my goddamn gear.

717
01:07:35,765 --> 01:07:37,460
You crazy bitch.

718
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,860
Let's lock him up
till we get him on the plane.

719
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,615
Come on! Move it, move it!

720
01:07:56,085 --> 01:07:58,019
Let's go, people. Get on!

721
01:07:58,187 --> 01:08:00,417
- All right.
- Attention, everybody...

722
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:02,216
Yeah, all right!

723
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,193
- Asshole.
- Shut up.

724
01:08:06,562 --> 01:08:08,427
Storm's on our ass. We gotta get moving.

725
01:08:08,597 --> 01:08:10,565
But we can't leave
without those canisters.

726
01:08:10,733 --> 01:08:13,861
- Fifteen minutes. That's all I can do.
- I'll take it.

727
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:17,233
I'm gonna see if any of his bags
made it to the transport.

728
01:08:17,606 --> 01:08:18,732
Sam.

729
01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:21,876
Thanks.

730
01:08:23,245 --> 01:08:25,008
I'll see you on the plane.

731
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:44,893
All exterior doors will
be locked according to winterize procedures.

732
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:48,302
Once you leave, you will not be able
to reenter the station.

733
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:53,238
We've got a Category 5 storm bearing
down on us. Move your ass, people.

734
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:11,717
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Shit.

735
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,308
Oh, God.

736
01:09:36,185 --> 01:09:37,618
Delfy.

737
01:09:42,124 --> 01:09:43,523
Whoa!

738
01:09:43,692 --> 01:09:45,159
It's me.

739
01:09:46,962 --> 01:09:49,624
I went looking for Doc.
I couldn't find him.

740
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,868
Carrie.

741
01:09:57,406 --> 01:09:58,873
Okay.

742
01:10:02,077 --> 01:10:04,170
We need you in the Comm Center.
Delfy's hurt bad.

743
01:10:04,346 --> 01:10:06,405
- What happened?
- He's been stabbed.

744
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:08,049
Be right there.

745
01:10:09,985 --> 01:10:11,350
What the hell's going on?

746
01:10:11,987 --> 01:10:13,579
- Haden's out.
- What?

747
01:10:13,756 --> 01:10:16,156
Yeah. Somehow, he escaped.

748
01:10:19,094 --> 01:10:21,153
Carrie, give me some room.

749
01:10:21,397 --> 01:10:23,661
Carrie, where the hell are you?
Where's Doc?

750
01:10:23,832 --> 01:10:27,427
- He's with us. We're still inside.
- You gotta leave. The base is locking down.

751
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:30,936
We can't. Haden's loose.
He tried to kill Delfy.

752
01:10:31,106 --> 01:10:32,539
Oh, man.

753
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:34,699
Look, we're not gonna make it
to the plane.

754
01:10:34,877 --> 01:10:38,438
Carrie, listen to me.
If we leave, you're stuck here all winter.

755
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:43,017
We know.

756
01:10:44,453 --> 01:10:46,785
Good luck. Be careful.

757
01:10:47,156 --> 01:10:49,681
All right. We gotta get him
to the clinic. Help me.

758
01:10:50,826 --> 01:10:53,590
Station-wide evacuation is in effect.

759
01:10:53,762 --> 01:10:57,562
Repeat, station is now
in emergency lockdown.

760
01:11:16,085 --> 01:11:20,920
Haden's taken the keys to his plane.
He's gonna try to beat the storm.

761
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:16,808
He's gone!

762
01:12:21,784 --> 01:12:24,912
He's going back. He's gonna lock us out.

763
01:12:44,406 --> 01:12:47,307
I'll check Operations.
You check Building D.

764
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:48,943
Be careful.

765
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:34,112
Doc.

766
01:14:34,283 --> 01:14:35,807
Doc!

767
01:17:06,535 --> 01:17:08,127
Oh!

768
01:18:38,827 --> 01:18:40,488
What are you doing?

769
01:18:41,797 --> 01:18:45,164
Finding out what's inside.
Don't you wanna know?

770
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:48,799
Well, not if it's radioactive, no.

771
01:18:50,605 --> 01:18:54,371
Well, don't you think the Soviets
would've put some kind of marking on it...

772
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:56,340
...if it were?

773
01:18:57,079 --> 01:19:01,015
Yeah, sure.
The mark would be on the cap.

774
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,143
But is it worth the risk?

775
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:24,630
What the...?

776
01:19:35,784 --> 01:19:38,514
Well, unless Haden
was smuggling radioactive jellybeans...

777
01:19:38,687 --> 01:19:40,211
...then he has a partner.

778
01:19:40,388 --> 01:19:42,856
- Yeah.
- Who?

779
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:47,051
He must've gotten out on that plane.

780
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:50,192
Yeah, he must have.

781
01:19:56,104 --> 01:19:58,004
Sour apple.

782
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:02,770
Sam, it must be on the transport.

783
01:20:03,111 --> 01:20:04,976
I don't know what to tell you.

784
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:07,911
- We've searched everything.
- You've searched all passengers?

785
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:10,551
Yeah. We found nothing suspicious.

786
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:12,118
It must be hidden on the base.

787
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,221
Are you sure everything on the manifest...

788
01:20:14,389 --> 01:20:17,358
...made it onto the plane?
- No, I'm not sure. We were so rushed.

789
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:19,721
- Do you have the manifest?
- I can get it.

790
01:20:19,895 --> 01:20:22,591
Yeah, fax it to me, Sam. Do it now.

791
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:24,890
So, what did he say?

792
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:29,261
They're still going through everything.
He'll call me when they're done.

793
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:32,296
You must be pretty wiped out, huh?

794
01:20:32,474 --> 01:20:34,567
Yeah, I'm gonna go clean up.

795
01:20:55,363 --> 01:20:56,830
Come on, Sam.

796
01:21:36,671 --> 01:21:40,767
Two-fifty-eight through
260, Science Building.

797
01:26:08,776 --> 01:26:10,368
It's a fresh wound.

798
01:26:11,146 --> 01:26:13,546
- Somebody must've treated him in the field.
- Yeah.

799
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:15,910
And they were in a hurry.

800
01:26:19,754 --> 01:26:22,882
Say the word, I'll bag the body,
put it on a plane to McMurdo.

801
01:26:23,057 --> 01:26:26,026
Let them sort it out. No big deal.

802
01:28:19,173 --> 01:28:20,435
They're diamonds.

803
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:26,241
Purest, the most valuable.

804
01:28:26,648 --> 01:28:28,912
They don't look like much till they're cut.

805
01:28:34,822 --> 01:28:37,017
You don't have a granddaughter.

806
01:28:37,525 --> 01:28:39,220
Do you?

807
01:28:41,396 --> 01:28:43,455
I don't have anything.

808
01:28:54,776 --> 01:28:58,075
Twelve years at Northwestern,
20 years of private practice...

809
01:28:58,246 --> 01:29:01,238
...and what the hell am I doing now?
I'm down here treating...

810
01:29:02,317 --> 01:29:05,445
...frostbite, hangover, whatever.

811
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:09,686
Those diamonds were under that ice
for 50 years. Who's gonna miss them?

812
01:29:09,857 --> 01:29:13,816
It was my chance to take back
something of what they took from me.

813
01:29:13,995 --> 01:29:15,622
From you?

814
01:29:16,331 --> 01:29:18,322
How about what you took from them?

815
01:29:19,233 --> 01:29:20,825
From me?

816
01:29:27,508 --> 01:29:29,066
We were friends.

817
01:29:36,084 --> 01:29:37,312
How's the hand?

818
01:29:39,987 --> 01:29:41,511
It hurts.

819
01:29:46,294 --> 01:29:48,819
Yeah, it will for some time.

820
01:29:49,864 --> 01:29:54,062
And even though they're gone,
you're gonna feel like they're there.

821
01:29:54,502 --> 01:29:56,766
I gotta turn you in, Doc.

822
01:30:00,475 --> 01:30:02,409
Yeah, I know that.

823
01:30:14,255 --> 01:30:16,951
I never meant for anyone to get hurt.

824
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:19,252
But Haden was too greedy.

825
01:30:19,427 --> 01:30:21,418
Hell, we all were.

826
01:30:24,766 --> 01:30:29,328
The aurora australis
is pretty special this time of year.

827
01:30:33,674 --> 01:30:36,336
You haven't really watched it, have you?

828
01:30:38,646 --> 01:30:40,011
No.

829
01:30:44,018 --> 01:30:46,384
I'd like to see it one last time.

830
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,227
Okay.

831
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:05,202
You owe it to yourself
to see it sometime.

832
01:31:11,612 --> 01:31:13,637
It's a hell of a show.

833
01:32:57,351 --> 01:32:58,716
Yeah.

834
01:33:01,222 --> 01:33:02,519
I feel a spare coming on.

835
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:06,126
I guarantee you don't split those posts.
This is sad. It's embarrassing.

836
01:33:06,294 --> 01:33:09,229
- Has he broken a hundred yet?
- Watch and learn.

837
01:33:10,431 --> 01:33:12,365
Oh, so sad.

838
01:33:13,134 --> 01:33:15,534
- I intimidate you, don't I?
- Oh, yeah.

839
01:33:15,703 --> 01:33:18,399
- Where are you going?
- I gotta do the rounds.

840
01:34:12,503 --> 01:34:22,399
THE END
