Listen.
Can you hear it?
The music.
I can hear it everywhere.
In the wind...
in the air...
in the light.
It's all around us.
All you have to do
is open yourself up.
All you have to do...
is listen.
Hello, Porky!
Where's your little friend?
- I don't know, Mr. Mannix.
- Find him, or your big butt's mine.
Where I've grown up...
Evan!
They tried to stop me
from hearing the music.
But, when I'm alone...
it builds up from inside me.
And I think if I could learn
how to play it...
they might hear me.
They would know I was theirs...
and find me.
Knock-knock.
- Knock-knock.
- Knock-knock.
- Wake up.
- Who's there?
Who's there?
Freak.
Freak!
- Said "knock-knock", freak.
- Who's there?
Your long lost mommy and daddy.
Can you hear them?
Yes.
No, you can't.
I Can.
You don't have no family.
You can't hear anything.
Say it.
- Say it.
- Say it.
- Say it!
- Say it!
Say it!
Yes.
I Can.
He doesn't hear anything.
What is he?
He's a freak.
Sweet dreams, freaks.
Sometimes, the world tries
to knock it out of you.
But I believe in music the way that
some people believe in fairy tales.
I like to imagine
that what I hear...
came from my mother and father.
Maybe the notes I hear are
the same ones they heard...
the night they met.
Maybe that's how
they found each other.
Maybe that's
how they'll find me.
Louis! Louie, where are you?
- Lyla?
- She's here.
What are you doing?
They're waiting for us.
Sit up straight, please.
Where are you, baby bro?
We didn't follow you from
San Francisco to play for free. Yeah?
We need this one, baby bro.
All right? I need this one.
Don't forget to smile.
And look relaxed.
All right, not that relaxed.
Come on, come on.
I believe that,
once upon a time...
long ago...
they heard the music
and followed it.
I break
I borrow
I live
I lose
I pray
I'm hollow
I'm dead confused
I'll find you.
Once you're here, you're never gone
Once you're here, you're never gone.
Fallen from a night of cold
A piece of me that I can't hold
I love you as I lose you more
I break outside this open door.
Catch me as I wash away.
You'll catch me as I wash away.
Well, catch me as I wash away.
Far away from me
I break.
Not bad, Connelly. Not bad.
Where's the main man?
Goddamn it, Louis.
Just wait, man.
Louis? Louis, wait up, man!
Girls! We are going
to a party tonight.
It's a full moon,
you know what that means, right?
Lyla!
It's a great sound, isn't it?
What are you doing?
Listening.
What are you doing?
I... I just came up here to...
Get away?
Have B Seat.
Come on.
Be brave. Front row, center.
Can you hear that?
What is that?
It's a wish.
Now, what does that sound like?
Well, it's a marvelous night
for a moon dance.
With the stars up above
in your eyes.
A fantabulous night
to make romance.
Beneath the cover
of October skies.
When I was a young fellow...
I used to talk to the moon.
Are you making that up?
God, I haven't done
that in a long time.
Does it ever talk back?
Well, it used to.
Now, I just find myself on
a roof talking to myself...
like a loon.
Just out here on me own.
Well, I'm here.
Yes, you are.
I'm Louis.
Lyla.
So, what's your story, Lyla?
I don't know. I'm just...
I'm just me.
What are you looking at?
You.
Next.
What did he want?
What did you say?
You know, same old junk.
New guy.
My name is Mr. Jeffries.
I'm with Child Services...
for the state of New York.
Okay, Evan.
Born December 17th, 1995.
Legal adoption to
New York Children's.
How long have you
been here, Evan?
11 years and 16 days.
I've been counting.
That's a long time.
How do you do that?
Do what?
Well, it's just imitating
the wind chimes.
You don't wanna be placed
with a real family?
I have a family.
Yes, you have parents and all,
but they don't live with you.
Not now.
But still, you don't have
contact with them.
Yes, I do.
You do?
What, do they call you?
Come and visit you? Send...
I don't wanna be sent away.
I understand.
You see, there's a lot
of children who...
are scared that if they leave
their first home...
their parents would never
be able to find them.
Right?
But my job is to make sure that nothin'
like that will ever happen to you.
So, there's nothing
to be scared of.
Thank you.
I'm gonna do something
I never do.
This is my number.
If you ever need
to talk to me...
about anything...
you call.
Think about what I said too.
There's a whole world out there
with millions of wind chimes.
I know.
You can go now.
Mannix says we're never gonna see
our real parents again.
Mannix is a big liar.
Yeah, I know. But...
what if he's right? I mean...
what if they don't ever come?
I don't even remember what
my mom looks like, you know?
Well, if they don't find us,
we'll just have to go find them.
Morning.
- I have to go.
- Let me walk you home.
NO!
My dad's waiting at the Sherry.
I've never done this before.
I'm in so much trouble.
Meet me here at 10 by the arch.
- Say yes.
- Put him out of his misery. Say yes.
Say yes.
Say yes.
I'll take that as a yes!
You are gonna be
in so much trouble.
You should have left
your dad a note.
Yeah, a ransom note.
You know what? I don't even care.
I just had the most
incredible night of my life.
Taxi!
Louis. She ain't coming.
Man, one girl?
Come on, we're gonna
miss the flight.
- Taxi!
- Louis!
Where you going, Louis?
Excuse me.
Louie!
You are not going anywhere.
Lyla!
Dad, I'm not going with you!
Lyla! You listen to me.
- Don't you dare walk away.
- I'm not going with you.
Lyla!
Get in the car right now.
Lyla! Lyla!
Louis!
Do you remember what Dad used
to say about princesses?
They're always looking for their
prince. And you ain't no prince.
How would you know?
What am I gonna do now?
I know they're out there somewhere.
I don't know where it comes from.
But it's what I hold on to.
And I can't let go.
Somewhere inside me...
I know that they
always wanted me.
Maybe they just got lost.
Walking through wintertime.
When the stars all shine.
The angel on the stairs.
Will tell you I was there.
Under the front porch light.
On a mystery night
I been sitting, watching life
pass from the sidelines.
Been waiting for a dream
To seep in through my blinds
I wondered what might happen
If I left this all behind.
Would the wind be at my back?
Could I get you off my mind?
This time?
What's the point in
singing, Marshall?
She's not gonna hear me.
I'm leaving the band.
I'm sorry, Marshall.
Don't quit on us, Louis.
The things I left behind.
Everything you've given up,
everything I've given up...
I can't do it. I'm sorry, Frank.
I can't do it, man.
- Louie, listen to me.
- No!
- You know what I mean, Lyla?
- Dad!
How to approach this problem.
Where are you gonna put the baby?
And what about this boy?
He's not here now. He's not here now!
- I'm leaving!
- You can't leave!
- Where you going, then?
- Just let me go! Just let me go!
Louis.
Lyla!
Hey, Louis.
Lyla!
We have fetal distress.
Baby's heart rate is falling.
It's falling.
I'm sorry.
He's gone.
Picked him up on the thruway
outside of Montrose.
Just wandering down the road.
Said he's following the music.
Moon told him to. Kid's a space cadet.
Look, I got a busy day
ahead of me.
All right, big guy, out you go.
This Jeffries guy wasn't
in his office yet.
So I left him a message to pick you
up right here when he does.
Here. Hold on.
And don't lose it.
If he doesn't show in an hour, give
another call. You can handle that?
You got any money?
Here's 12 bucks.
Damn, kid, put it in your pocket.
See you.
Get on the sidewalk!
Give me your money.
Come here, sweet honey.
Come here, baby.
Okay, citizen.
You paid. Any requests?
NO.
All right then.
Father, hear me when
I call your name
I need you to answer me now.
Father, here I am.
Weak in your sight.
Can you rescue me now?
I'm crying out
Can't figure it out on my own.
Whoa, back off! Away, away!
You, son, you messing
with my equilibrium.
Nobody touches this instrument
but me. Roxy's my girl.
Son, we done here, so why don't
you go find your mommy, all right?
I don't know where she is.
Good, that's great. Cops show up
around six. Tell them you're AWOL.
They'll send you back
where you come from.
I don't wanna go back there.
Whatever. Good. This day has been
a bust anyway. I'm out.
What?
I don't have a place to stay.
Do I look like a real estate
tycoon to you?
How many dead presidents you got?
Nuggets? Shorts?
Show me the money.
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?
No, I'm thinking something else.
I'm let you buy me a pizza.
I've been doing this for
ten years, Bob. I said 10%.
We need to close the deal.
Hold on a second.
No. We said 10%.
Yeah, well, it makes the world
go around, doesn't it, Bob?
Just get me the 10%, will you?
Thanks.
Shit.
- Need anything, sir?
- Do you know any hit men?
I do know a bass player who
might be able to help you out.
Likes to get in fights
with lead singers.
Nick?
What are you doing, man?
I'm still driving. Paying off those
wedding bills from last year.
Oh, fair play to you.
She's a nice girl.
So, you playing at all?
Nope.
Why the hell not?
Your fingers fall off?
Well, you move on.
What about the lads?
Seen any of them lately?
We still mess around, but...
the "Connelly Brothers" never really
bounced back minus one brother.
You seen Marshall lately?
Have you?
It's my birthday on Saturday.
Session's at my place.
Come, bring your girlfriend.
It's great seeing you, man.
Reminds me of New York.
The good old days, eh?
I know!
I know.
I know. Okay, I don't know.
F? R Elise, by Beethoven.
And you should know that one.
Oh yeah.
Will you be our teacher forever,
Miss Novacek?
Well, at least until your
old teacher comes back.
But only if you call me...
- Lyla!
- That's right.
- You're crazy, Miss Novacek.
- Megan?
Got everything?
Bye!
Thanks!
There you are.
Now before you say no...
okay, picture this.
You onstage, me accompanying,
thousands of people.
- Liz.
- The New York Philharmonic.
I just got the invite.
They want you back.
It's just one night,
but they want you back.
I don't want to be up there.
Lyla.
When are you gonna let
yourself be happy again?
I am happy.
I'm talking about when
everyone else goes home.
Look...
Look. I know. Okay? I know.
Just think about it. You're a music
teacher who doesn't play any more.
Call me crazy.
Okay, Crazy.
I'll see you at home. Okay?
An right.
Nah. I ain't got no daddy.
See, my pops was a drunk.
And my mama, she took off with
this crackhead named Little Jesus.
But, you know, he wasn't no Little
Jesus, you know what I'm saying?
Nah. They never gave
a damn about me.
Come on, man!
This is us right here.
- I've been with Wizard for years.
- Who's Wizard?
He's a real piece of work,
that's what he is.
His real name is
Maxwell Wallace.
He took me in. He said
that I was an investment.
He gave me Roxy here.
He bought it in the old days.
Well, he really didn't buy it.
Guess you'd kind of say he found it.
All right, he stole it.
Wizard, he gave me his
place at the Square.
My parents?
They ain't give me nothing.
We all going be big stars someday.
What's the password?
Open the damn door already.
You getting on my nerves
is the password.
Okay, follow me.
What's your name again?
It's Evan, right?
This is our home, son. It's kind of
crazy in here, so stay on your feet.
Yeah, I been living here
for a while. Come on, man.
- So, how much money you make today?
- I made ten dollars.
- I am not lying.
- What'd I tell you about that?
I'll be laughing
at your funeral!
I'm going to go play basketball.
My life, the sky
Like a feather I'll fly.
Man, you should've knocked him
on his head or something.
Pizza!
You better hurry
before Wizard shows.
He'll be pissed if he'd
seen you bought a pie.
I ain't take no family money.
Citizen bought it.
Hello, music lovers!
Ah, while the cat's away...
Who likes pizza?
Who did this?
Arthur?
- What is he?
- He's a damn fool!
He's a damn fool!
He's gonna get it good.
What are you, Arthur?
I'm a real piece of work, Wizard.
You're on thin ice.
I didn't take no family money!
He bought it.
What?
You look crazy.
I am crazy.
SEE?
Come here.
Now!
Come on.
What's your name?
Evan, sir.
What are you doing here?
I followed the music.
Where'd you pick this one up,
Arthur? Bellevue?
You never played
a note in your life.
Do you know what music is?
God's reminder there's something
else besides us in this universe.
Harmonic connection between
all living beings everywhere...
even the stars.
Is this a school?
Yeah, the school of "Screw you
and take all your damn money".
- Yeah, we're top of the class!
- Not!
It's a business.
Pockets!
Pockets!
Peanut. Well done.
I got eyes in the
back of my head.
Good job.
Chain is only as strong...
as its weakest link.
Come on, Arthur.
That's chump change.
You got Washington Square.
That was my spot for ten years.
Go ahead, before I change my mind.
You kids are gonna put me
in the poorhouse.
All right, little mice, scurry back
to your holes. Go, go!
Harmonic dreams, sweet children.
Roxanne!
Man, I'm gonna kill him!
You know what's out there?
A series of higher tones.
It's arranged by nature...
it's governed by the laws of
physics of the whole universe.
It's an overtone, it's an energy,
it's a wavelength.
And if you're not riding it,
good Lord, you'll never hear it.
Where do you think
it comes from?
What I hear?
I think it comes from all around you,
really. I mean, it's...
Comes through us, some of us.
It's invisible, but you feel it.
So, only some of us can hear it?
Only some of us are listening.
Do you think my parents
are listening?
I hear you, kid.
Like?
Yeah.
Are you hearing a word I'm saying?
Louis!
Come on.
It's about time I met your family.
Listen, Jen, maybe this
isn't such a good idea.
Grow up. Come on.
Come on.
- The angel on the stairs.
- Are all Irish people this loud?
Yeah.
Will tell you I was there.
Under the full moon's light
On the mystery night
I been sitting, watching life
pass from the sidelines.
Been waiting for a dream
To seep in through my blinds.
Hey, Marshall, your brother's here.
Louis!
Hey, Nick.
Oh my God!
Is that you?
When were you gonna tell me
you were in a band?
I'm sure there's a lot of things
our Louis hasn't told you, darling.
- Like who'd you write the song for?
- I told you this was a mistake.
That's it, go on.
Walk out on us again.
- Hey, Louis.
- Say what you gotta say.
Come on, say what you
have to say.
- Come on, say it. Come on.
- That the best you got?
- Come on, say it!
- That the best you got, man?
Come on! Hit me!
Come on, hit me!
Feel what? Come on! Hit me!
I'm suffocating in here!
You all right, man?
You all right, man?
Welcome to the Connelly clan.
Jennifer.
You know, it was good having
the old Louis back in there...
even if it was only for a second.
Louie...
aren't you supposed to be
in the car with the girl...
as she drives off into the sunset?
Get your suit dirty
sitting there, man.
This is a message for Lyla Novacek.
Please call Good Samaritan Hospital.
I'm calling about your father,
Thomas Novacek.
I wasn't sure you
were going to come.
My will is in the top drawer
of the desk in my study.
Dad, stop, come on.
Lyla, please...
there's more.
All I ever wanted for you to have
all that promise, all that life.
But you were so young.
We had so much work to do.
You weren't ready.
That's plenty, Dad. Really.
I mean, a baby, that...
A baby, he could have hurt you.
He could've hurt you, and I wasn't
going to let that happen, Lyla.
I made a choice for us.
Oh my God!
A choice for us.
Wait...
I'm sorry.
Where?
Where is he?
I didn't mean...
Where is he?
I don't know.
I don't.
You gotta love music
more than you love food.
More than life.
More than yourself.
You feel it?
Then, show me.
Play it for your parents.
You're flying, kid.
You know what I'm thinking?
You're supposed to say:
What are you thinking, Wizard?
What are you thinking, Wizard?
I'll teach you everything
I know for free.
You get Roxanne.
You get my corner of the Park.
You get to keep half your tips.
We're like a team.
There's something wrong
with that picture.
What?
I don't think performing in parks
and corners is gonna be enough.
It won't?
Evan.
We're gonna need get you a new name.
Something with a little more pop.
I mean, in the whole world,
what do you want to be?
Close your eyes and
think about that.
Found.
Doesn't have enough "yin".
Little more "yang", you know?
Yeah, let's see.
Talk about wishful thinking.
See that?
What name stands out
to you on that?
Beach?
It's a good name for a band,
but not for a performer.
You can't say:
Please, welcome Beach.
No. August Rush!
August Rush. Doesn't that
warm you up a little bit?
I can see it:
Wizard Productions presents...
the number one heat wave...
"August Rush!"
It's me! Yeah! August! August!
It gives me a rush!
That gives me chills!
The hair on the back of my neck's
standing up. Look at that.
Quick, check it out. Yeah!
Yeah! August!
- August Rush!
- August Rush! August Rush!
That's you!
New York, Lyla?
What are you doing in New York?
Lizzy, I mean, I've always
felt that he was alive.
I see kids that would be his age,
and I imagine what he'd look like.
- Big blue eyes like his dad, and...
- Oh my God, Lyla.
Lizzy, I used to lie in bed at night
and I swear I could hear him.
- I swear I could hear him.
- Lyla, calm down.
Calm down?! How can I be calm?
How can I be calm?
I've been calm for over ten years,
and look where it's gotten me!
Lyla, you're losing it.
You're right.
And maybe it's about time.
Don't do anything crazy,
okay, sweetie?
We're on our honeymoon,
but We're leaving.
We'll get there
as soon as we can, okay?
Okay, Jack, he's worth three times
what you're offering him, okay?
- You heard him in the Park!
- Wallace, you're a pain in the ass!
250 if he can play for
two hours straight.
- No, five, or he walks.
- 500?!
- I'll give him 250...
- 500 or he walks, all right?
- He walks?
- We have lightning in a bottle!
No parents. I'm his guardian.
I'm his representation,
that's why I'm making the deal.
May I help you?
I'm trying to find my son.
Name?
Mommy!
I don't know.
I'm sorry, ma'am, we're closing.
Please, I just,
I want to know his name.
To even consider re-establishing
contact with a child...
there is a detailed process.
I don't care about your process!
Okay?!
Ma'am, we're closed.
Come back tomorrow.
Lyla.
Novacek.
- Hi, this is Lyla...
- And Lizzy...
and we're not here right now.
So, leave a message.
Arthur!
What'd I tell you about
talking to strangers?
Yeah, what's your name?
My name is Mr. Jeffries.
And yours?
Arthur. We ain't strangers now.
Look, Mr. Wallace,
I'm here making my normal rounds.
I'm trying to find these kids.
This girl, her name is Geralda,
she should be about 14 now.
Don't know her, Mr. Jeffries.
Okay, well, maybe you can help me
with this young man.
Little boy that came up missing
recently. His name is Evan Taylor.
He's about 12.
And what if I find this Evan
and I turn him over to you?
What then?
You don't care about a kid
after he's in the system.
- It's not like that for...
- I know exactly what it's like.
You don't follow up.
And you throw him
from place to place.
Eventually you end up in a place
where they kick the crap out of you.
Go to bed at night and...
he tries to close his eyes,
ears, shut out the world.
What happens to that kid?
What do you think he hears?
What do you think he hears?!
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- He's good!
14th Precinct.
Sergeant O'Malley.
No. That doesn't cut it.
NO!
Oh, is that final?! Okay,
here's my final offer: We're history!
- Deal's off.
- But I wanna play.
You play when I say play. Breathe
when I say breathe. You got that?
But I have to play.
Wizard, I need them to hear!
You forget about your parents!
They were quick to forget about you.
You don't know how
it could be for you.
You do not know how
precious your gift is.
You're just a kid,
you don't know.
I do, August.
- Wizard! Wizard!
- Talk to me. What happened?
It's Arthur.
The cops chased him back here.
- Okay, split up. You know the drill.
- We gotta help Arty.
Forget about Arty.
Arty's on his own. That's the book.
NO!
- August! August!
- Grab him! Grab him! There he goes!
Up there! You see him? See him?
Hey, you! Cops! Cops!
Cops! Over here!
Listen, you can't let
the cops catch you.
If they do, you don't tell them
your real name...
because they'll send you right back
where you came from, you got that?
I don't want to lose you. But if we
get separated, we meet at the arch.
Do not tell them your name.
When I say run, you run, okay?
Let me see your hands.
Now!
Run, August! Run, August!
Run!
Hey, kid, stop!
Open the door!
How I don't need that man
But they don't understand.
There's far too many
questions in reality.
Dealing with the pain of stress
And poverty.
And I gotta be myself
Because there's nobody else for me.
Hang in there with me.
Sometimes it takes a different
kind of love to raise a child.
So don't give up
When pressures come down.
Sometimes it takes a different
kind of dream to make you smile.
So raise it up
Hang in there with me.
Sometimes we need another
helping hand to show the way.
So don't give up
When pressures come down.
Sometimes it seems impossible
That's why we pray.
Seems to be nothing left for me.
Mama's gone
Daddy didn't wanna be.
Now I'm all by myself
wondering where is love.
Or should I just give up, you know.
Life falls down on me
Cuts into my soul.
But I know I got the strength
to make it through it all.
Cause I'm still standing tall
Breaking through these walls
I'm gonna give my all, hey
I'm feeling like a motherless child.
Pain cuts into my soul.
It's beaten me down
Can't find a smile.
On the face of a motherless child.
Gonna break down these walls
Gonna give my all.
Sometimes it takes a different
kind of love to raise a child.
So don't give up
When pressures come down.
Sometimes it takes a different
kind of dream to make you smile.
So raise it up
Hang in there with me.
Sometimes it takes another's
helping hand to show you the way.
So don't give up
When pressures come down.
Sometimes it seems impossible
That's why we pray.
Hi.
I know how this looks, you know.
I'm not crazy.
Nobody thinks you're crazy.
What's your name?
Lyla Novacek.
Well, it's like the woman
explained to you.
- You fill out a couple forms...
- No, no, six months, they said.
I don't have six months for forms.
Then, I can't help you there.
Explain something to me now.
Why now?
Why not before? Why is it so
important that you want him now?
I've always wanted him.
I've waited 11 years,
two months, and 15 days...
to find out that he's alive.
I've been counting.
- Hi, this is Lyla...
- And Lizzy...
and we're not here right now.
So leave a message.
When the one thing you're looking for
Is nowhere to be found.
And you're back-stepping
all of your moves.
Trying to figure it out.
What are you waiting for?
You see, I know this girl that lives
across the street. Lyla Novacek.
I've been standing outside
here waiting, you know?
I wrote her a song.
Oh, the musician.
She keeps me up half the night.
But I haven't seen her in a few days.
She's off on her honeymoon.
Thanks.
And you want give up
You want to give in.
Your head's wrapped around
What's around the next bend.
You wish you could find
something warm.
Because you're shivering cold.
But it's the first thing you see
As you open your eyes.
The last thing you say.
As you're saying goodbye.
But something inside you
Is crying and driving you on.
And this isn't your signature.
You do realize that he's probably
placed with a family, correct?
Do you have children,
Mr. Jeffries?
I did.
Then you know.
What's his birthday?
December 17th, 1995.
Yeah, I know.
Excuse me a minute.
This is him.
Yeah.
You're the one slept under my bed?
Do you live here?
Me and my grandma do,
till our boat comes in.
Do you like music?
More than food.
Do you know your notes?
I've never seen them
like that before.
See here.
Every Good Boy Does Fine.
On the lines. And...
F-A-C-E, in-between.
And Great Big Dogs Fight Animals...
and All Cars Eat Gas.
Get it?
You're like an angel.
Okay. I gotta go.
Gotta go to school.
Can I borrow this?
Later.
Holy...
Reverend James!
You're not gonna believe this,
Reverend J! Come quick!
Slow down, Hope.
You've gotta see what's happened.
Remember in Music Appreciation
we had a class on Mozart?
Remember you said he was
like a musical "pod"?
- Prodigy.
- Exactly!
Well, I have one of those,
and he's living under my bed.
So, I showed him the scales and
when I came home, he was...
Mr. Jeffries, hi.
It's Lyla Novacek again.
I was just checking in.
Right, I understand.
You know, if there's any more
information or... just call.
I'll take it.
How long do you think
you'll be staying?
As long as it takes.
Sorry.
I don't know, Lizzy.
It's like...
I just woke up and I should
start playing again.
I should play.
I know it sounds crazy,
but maybe he'll hear me.
Hey, Marshall. It's me.
I'm in New York.
Is the band still minus
one mad Connelly brother?
Having you guys here
it'd be great, you know?
Just an idea.
Hey, Frank!
It's Louis.
Louis Connelly.
And?
I played here with me band a couple
a years ago. About ten years ago.
Hey, listen, Frank!
I'm going to play you one song,
all right? Just one song.
And if you don't like it,
you can throw me out.
You brought us a prodigy,
Reverend.
He is a mystery.
Dean, I thought he was an angel.
There's no record of an
August Rush anywhere.
It's about foundation, starting
with a very simple, orderly chord.
As you open your eyes.
The last thing you say
As you're saying goodbye.
But something inside you.
Is crying and driving you on
Lyla. Just relax.
You're pushing yourself too hard.
I don't know if I can do this.
You're playing with the Philharmonic.
That's great.
Okay, let's keep going.
Start with a C major chord,
then a modulation to G.
Once we get to G,
you go back to C, very simple.
And we go C, G, C.
From the very beginning,
C major chord.
We have this chaotic evolution
into a remote G major.
What's this? August?
The diminished fifth, sir.
Key change here.
And then the rise with
those round horns...
the oboes, into the
allegro staccato strings.
Mr. Rush.
I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizing, August?
Sometimes I don't listen and I don't
do homework like I'm supposed to.
Well, I'm sure you'll
do better in the future.
The New York Philharmonic Orchestra
is having a concert.
In the history of this school...
we've never performed the work
of a first year student...
and certainly no one of your age.
But now, we've asked them if they
could perform your rhapsody.
Would you like that?
Oh! Good. Good.
How many people will hear it?
Well, it would be performed in
Central Park, on the Great Lawn.
A hundred?
Much more. Thousands.
Okay. Because I need to play it
to a lot of people. Lots and lots.
We'll see what we can do to help.
August, three artists
will be performing...
and you will be featured last.
How do you do it?
How does the music come to you?
I just hear it.
Sometimes I wake up
and it's there...
or I hear it when I'm
walking down the street.
It's like someone is
calling out to me.
Writing it all down is like
I'm calling back to them.
Who?
The ones who gave me the music.
You sure you're ready
for this, Louis?
Are you?
Bravo, August!
Good one!
August.
Boy, you're a hard guy to find.
- Been looking everywhere for you.
- Excuse me.
- You're interrupting a rehearsal.
- A rehearsal, right!
And you are?
Come here to me, son.
Come here.
What'd they do to you?
Nothing.
These people could
steal your soul.
Sir, whoever you are,
you don't have the right!
I'm his father, all right?
I have every right.
I'll take you home now. Come on.
But I have a concert.
I like it here.
- He's a remarkable boy...
- You don't think I know that?!
What'd you do, you just
snatched him up off the street?
That gives you the right?
Wait a moment, we've been
teaching him here.
What are you gonna do? Fill his head
with classical theory and rules?
You can't learn music from books!
It's out there.
You teach him?!
He teaches you.
You learn from him!
We are. I assure you,
Mr. Rush, every day.
Come on.
You should be with family.
Mr. Rush, please!
Do you've any idea of the importance
of the concert tomorrow for August?
August. Wait, listen.
You gotta tell me right now:
Is this man really your father?
You can tell me the truth.
I know your real name.
Evan.
August.
Evan.
Is he your father?
He taught me everything I know.
And we are back, we are back.
Don't make it harder for yourself,
Aug. Wizard's not so bad.
You saw the kid, right? He's a freak
of nature. Okay, here's the deal:
Thousand a night, two weeks minimum,
three cities guaranteed.
Then we ship him out to your
partner on the West Coast.
He just ain't feeling well.
He said you the only one who
gonna make him feel better.
Competition. All right,
I'll be back. You do what you do.
I'm his representation.
That's why I'm making the deal.
Come on. No, there's no parents.
Great sounds, kid.
Gibson J-200?
It's beautiful.
Can I see her?
It's okay.
I'm a musician, too.
Nice action.
You're pretty good.
Thanks.
See what you can do with mine.
How long you been playing?
Six months.
Six months? How'd you learn how
to play like that in six months?
Juilliard.
Juilliard?
Yes, sir. I have my
own concert tonight.
So you reckon
I should believe you?
Yeah. But I can't go.
Why's that?
It's kind of a long story.
Well, if I went to Juilliard
and I had a concert tonight...
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Yeah.
But what if something bad
would happen if you did it?
You never quit on your music.
No matter what happens.
Because anytime something bad
happens to you...
it's the one place you can
escape to and just let it go.
I learned that the hard way.
And anyway, look at me...
nothing bad's gonna happen.
Gotta have a little faith.
I'm Louis.
Ev... August. August Rush.
August Rush.
Cool name.
August!
Come on!
I gotta go, August.
Bye.
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye.
Yes, I made him memorize our number.
I understand. Your department's
doing everything they can.
Do you think anything bad
happened to him?
I'm sure he's fine.
I prayed for him. Did you?
Yeah.
Well, if his father loves him
like he should...
then he'll do what's best
for his son.
You believe that, don't you?
Yeah.
Good. Now go get ready.
Welcome to our Concert
in the Park...
and the Mercedes Drive Your
Future Scholarship Celebration.
Now, it is with enormous pleasure...
that I welcome back to the concert
stage one of Julliard's own...
Lyla Novacek.
So long you've been running in circles
around what's at stake.
But now the time's come for your feet
to stand still in one place.
You wanna reach out
You wanna give in.
Your head's wrapped around
what's around the next bend.
You wish you could find
something warm.
Because you're shivering cold.
It's the first thing you see
As you open your eyes.
The last thing you say
As you're saying goodbye.
Something inside you is crying
Driving you on.
Because if you hadn't found me
I would have found you
I would have found you
I have to go now.
I'm not coming back this time.
He's just kidding, Wizard.
Me and August have a understanding.
Don't we?
Aug, you can't leave me, man.
Yes, I can.
Because you have to find
your parents, right?
Yeah. My concert's starting.
All my money's on the fact your
folks won't be able to find you.
You know why?
Because they can't hear you.
Because they're probably dead.
You're not going anywhere.
Nowhere to go, son.
Run, boy!
Run, August, run!
I would have found you
August!
August!
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Music has always
fascinated us...
in the way that it communicates,
without words...
without pictures.
And that leads us to
our final performance.
Say, how much longer
to the airport?
Man, it's jammed up with traffic.
Bring you back to
the old days, Louis?
August Rush.
Evan Taylor?
Unfortunately, our last
performer seems to...
He's here. He's here. He's here!
Oh! Excellent.
Perhaps there's no one else who
can better personify the mystery...
that is music...
than our final composer.
Hey, what's that?
Concerts in the Park
every spring.
Let me out.
Let me out! Let me out!
The music is all around us.
All you have to do is listen.
