1
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,228
Listen.

2
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,649
Can you hear it?

3
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,237
The music.

4
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,825
I can hear it everywhere.

5
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,288
In the wind...

6
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,000
in the air...

7
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,837
in the light.

8
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,428
It's all around us.

9
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,983
All you have to do
is open yourself up.

10
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,287
All you have to do...

11
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,499
is listen.

12
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,300
Hello, Porky!

13
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,302
Where's your little friend?

14
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,681
- I don't know, Mr. Mannix.
- Find him, or your big butt's mine.

15
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,684
Where I've grown up...

16
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:22,976
Evan!

17
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,691
They tried to stop me
from hearing the music.

18
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,989
But, when I'm alone...

19
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,618
it builds up from inside me.

20
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,707
And I think if I could learn
how to play it...

21
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,714
they might hear me.

22
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,342
They would know I was theirs...

23
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,804
and find me.

24
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,933
Knock-knock.

25
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,519
- Knock-knock.
- Knock-knock.

26
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,730
- Wake up.
- Who's there?

27
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,356
Who's there?

28
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,816
Freak.

29
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,568
Freak!

30
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,363
- Said "knock-knock", freak.
- Who's there?

31
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,367
Your long lost mommy and daddy.

32
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:22,953
Can you hear them?

33
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:25,747
Yes.

34
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,379
No, you can't.

35
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,757
I Can.

36
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,764
You don't have no family.

37
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,142
You can't hear anything.

38
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,144
Say it.

39
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,855
- Say it.
- Say it.

40
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,566
- Say it!
- Say it!

41
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,070
Say it!

42
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,614
Yes.

43
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,406
I Can.

44
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,328
He doesn't hear anything.

45
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,250
What is he?

46
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,253
He's a freak.

47
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,008
Sweet dreams, freaks.

48
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,228
Sometimes, the world tries
to knock it out of you.

49
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:38,279
But I believe in music the way that
some people believe in fairy tales.

50
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,481
I like to imagine
that what I hear...

51
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,088
came from my mother and father.

52
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:19,528
Maybe the notes I hear are
the same ones they heard...

53
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,530
the night they met.

54
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,951
Maybe that's how
they found each other.

55
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,124
Maybe that's
how they'll find me.

56
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,376
Louis! Louie, where are you?

57
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,254
- Lyla?
- She's here.

58
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,882
What are you doing?
They're waiting for us.

59
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,842
Sit up straight, please.

60
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,844
Where are you, baby bro?

61
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,848
We didn't follow you from
San Francisco to play for free. Yeah?

62
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,351
We need this one, baby bro.
All right? I need this one.

63
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,395
Don't forget to smile.
And look relaxed.

64
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,358
All right, not that relaxed.
Come on, come on.

65
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,405
I believe that,
once upon a time...

66
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,991
long ago...

67
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,996
they heard the music
and followed it.

68
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,066
I break

69
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,652
I borrow

70
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,780
I live

71
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,366
I lose

72
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,244
I pray

73
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,413
I'm hollow

74
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:40,085
I'm dead confused

75
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,421
I'll find you.

76
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:52,681
Once you're here, you're never gone
Once you're here, you're never gone.

77
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:58,103
Fallen from a night of cold
A piece of me that I can't hold

78
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,272
I love you as I lose you more

79
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,484
I break outside this open door.

80
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,986
Catch me as I wash away.

81
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,530
You'll catch me as I wash away.

82
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,742
Well, catch me as I wash away.

83
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:32,054
Far away from me

84
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,724
I break.

85
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,337
Not bad, Connelly. Not bad.

86
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,340
Where's the main man?

87
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,218
Goddamn it, Louis.
Just wait, man.

88
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,431
Louis? Louis, wait up, man!

89
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,230
Girls! We are going
to a party tonight.

90
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,108
It's a full moon,
you know what that means, right?

91
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,246
Lyla!

92
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,335
It's a great sound, isn't it?

93
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,212
What are you doing?

94
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,298
Listening.

95
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,427
What are you doing?

96
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,849
I... I just came up here to...

97
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,852
Get away?

98
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,316
Have B Seat.

99
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,359
Come on.

100
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,322
Be brave. Front row, center.

101
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,140
Can you hear that?

102
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,601
What is that?

103
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,895
It's a wish.

104
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,031
Now, what does that sound like?

105
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:43,912
Well, it's a marvelous night
for a moon dance.

106
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:48,667
With the stars up above
in your eyes.

107
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:53,296
A fantabulous night
to make romance.

108
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,384
Beneath the cover
of October skies.

109
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,846
When I was a young fellow...

110
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,682
I used to talk to the moon.

111
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,144
Are you making that up?

112
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,273
God, I haven't done
that in a long time.

113
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,403
Does it ever talk back?

114
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,282
Well, it used to.

115
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,537
Now, I just find myself on
a roof talking to myself...

116
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,290
like a loon.

117
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,296
Just out here on me own.

118
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,176
Well, I'm here.

119
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,847
Yes, you are.

120
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,107
I'm Louis.

121
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,986
Lyla.

122
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,906
So, what's your story, Lyla?

123
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,702
I don't know. I'm just...

124
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,791
I'm just me.

125
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,591
What are you looking at?

126
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,469
You.

127
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,778
Next.

128
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,197
What did he want?
What did you say?

129
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,284
You know, same old junk.
New guy.

130
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:33,081
My name is Mr. Jeffries.
I'm with Child Services...

131
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,875
for the state of New York.

132
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:42,340
Okay, Evan.
Born December 17th, 1995.

133
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,760
Legal adoption to
New York Children's.

134
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,766
How long have you
been here, Evan?

135
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,977
11 years and 16 days.

136
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,689
I've been counting.

137
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,567
That's a long time.

138
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,319
How do you do that?

139
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,237
Do what?

140
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,453
Well, it's just imitating
the wind chimes.

141
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,719
You don't wanna be placed
with a real family?

142
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,262
I have a family.

143
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:34,601
Yes, you have parents and all,
but they don't live with you.

144
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,019
Not now.

145
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,856
But still, you don't have
contact with them.

146
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,024
Yes, I do.

147
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,944
You do?

148
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,282
What, do they call you?

149
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,537
Come and visit you? Send...

150
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,542
I don't wanna be sent away.

151
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,255
I understand.

152
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,052
You see, there's a lot
of children who...

153
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,055
are scared that if they leave
their first home...

154
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,432
their parents would never
be able to find them.

155
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,310
Right?

156
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:22,857
But my job is to make sure that nothin'
like that will ever happen to you.

157
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,403
So, there's nothing
to be scared of.

158
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,572
Thank you.

159
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,415
I'm gonna do something
I never do.

160
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,584
This is my number.

161
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,212
If you ever need
to talk to me...

162
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,007
about anything...

163
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,426
you call.

164
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,803
Think about what I said too.

165
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,891
There's a whole world out there
with millions of wind chimes.

166
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,810
I know.

167
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,945
You can go now.

168
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,207
Mannix says we're never gonna see
our real parents again.

169
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,251
Mannix is a big liar.

170
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,880
Yeah, I know. But...

171
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,757
what if he's right? I mean...

172
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,009
what if they don't ever come?

173
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,470
I don't even remember what
my mom looks like, you know?

174
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:40,101
Well, if they don't find us,
we'll just have to go find them.

175
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,061
Morning.

176
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,108
- I have to go.
- Let me walk you home.

177
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,651
NO!

178
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,694
My dad's waiting at the Sherry.

179
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,281
I've never done this before.
I'm in so much trouble.

180
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,703
Meet me here at 10 by the arch.

181
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,163
- Say yes.
- Put him out of his misery. Say yes.

182
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,083
Say yes.

183
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,835
Say yes.

184
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,217
I'll take that as a yes!

185
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,974
You are gonna be
in so much trouble.

186
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,851
You should have left
your dad a note.

187
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,728
Yeah, a ransom note.
You know what? I don't even care.

188
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,940
I just had the most
incredible night of my life.

189
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,608
Taxi!

190
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,201
Louis. She ain't coming.

191
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,329
Man, one girl?

192
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,207
Come on, we're gonna
miss the flight.

193
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,587
- Taxi!
- Louis!

194
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,881
Where you going, Louis?

195
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,634
Excuse me.

196
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,971
Louie!

197
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,474
You are not going anywhere.
Lyla!

198
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,476
Dad, I'm not going with you!

199
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,478
Lyla! You listen to me.

200
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,773
- Don't you dare walk away.
- I'm not going with you.

201
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,533
Lyla!

202
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,917
Get in the car right now.

203
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,422
Lyla! Lyla!

204
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,229
Louis!

205
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:35,317
Do you remember what Dad used
to say about princesses?

206
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:39,572
They're always looking for their
prince. And you ain't no prince.

207
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,075
How would you know?

208
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,827
What am I gonna do now?

209
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,302
I know they're out there somewhere.

210
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,944
I don't know where it comes from.

211
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,491
But it's what I hold on to.

212
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,872
And I can't let go.

213
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,004
Somewhere inside me...

214
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,841
I know that they
always wanted me.

215
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,846
Maybe they just got lost.

216
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,267
Walking through wintertime.

217
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,729
When the stars all shine.

218
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,611
The angel on the stairs.

219
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,868
Will tell you I was there.

220
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,748
Under the front porch light.

221
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,792
On a mystery night

222
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:27,055
I been sitting, watching life
pass from the sidelines.

223
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:34,312
Been waiting for a dream
To seep in through my blinds

224
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:40,526
I wondered what might happen
If I left this all behind.

225
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,946
Would the wind be at my back?

226
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,952
Could I get you off my mind?

227
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,328
This time?

228
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,331
What's the point in
singing, Marshall?

229
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,334
She's not gonna hear me.

230
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,213
I'm leaving the band.
I'm sorry, Marshall.

231
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,340
Don't quit on us, Louis.

232
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,804
The things I left behind.

233
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,099
Everything you've given up,
everything I've given up...

234
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,395
I can't do it. I'm sorry, Frank.
I can't do it, man.

235
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,230
- Louie, listen to me.
- No!

236
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,440
- You know what I mean, Lyla?
- Dad!

237
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,236
How to approach this problem.
Where are you gonna put the baby?

238
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,572
And what about this boy?
He's not here now. He's not here now!

239
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,407
- I'm leaving!
- You can't leave!

240
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,119
- Where you going, then?
- Just let me go! Just let me go!

241
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,335
Louis.

242
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,255
Lyla!

243
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:45,716
Hey, Louis.

244
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,719
Lyla!

245
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,370
We have fetal distress.

246
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,123
Baby's heart rate is falling.

247
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,419
It's falling.

248
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,492
I'm sorry.

249
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:59,207
He's gone.

250
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,605
Picked him up on the thruway
outside of Montrose.

251
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,141
Just wandering down the road.

252
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:10,736
Said he's following the music.
Moon told him to. Kid's a space cadet.

253
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,619
Look, I got a busy day
ahead of me.

254
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,653
All right, big guy, out you go.

255
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,750
This Jeffries guy wasn't
in his office yet.

256
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,481
So I left him a message to pick you
up right here when he does.

257
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,673
Here. Hold on.
And don't lose it.

258
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,552
If he doesn't show in an hour, give
another call. You can handle that?

259
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,429
You got any money?

260
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:37,888
Here's 12 bucks.

261
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,516
Damn, kid, put it in your pocket.

262
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,310
See you.

263
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,891
Get on the sidewalk!

264
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:16,922
Give me your money.

265
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:22,178
Come here, sweet honey.

266
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:26,223
Come here, baby.

267
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,373
Okay, citizen.
You paid. Any requests?

268
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,209
NO.

269
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,003
All right then.

270
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:05,386
Father, hear me when
I call your name

271
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:09,850
I need you to answer me now.

272
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:14,021
Father, here I am.

273
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,149
Weak in your sight.

274
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:21,153
Can you rescue me now?

275
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:27,368
I'm crying out
Can't figure it out on my own.

276
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:31,246
Whoa, back off! Away, away!

277
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,998
You, son, you messing
with my equilibrium.

278
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:36,418
Nobody touches this instrument
but me. Roxy's my girl.

279
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,436
Son, we done here, so why don't
you go find your mommy, all right?

280
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,006
I don't know where she is.

281
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:45,302
Good, that's great. Cops show up
around six. Tell them you're AWOL.

282
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,193
They'll send you back
where you come from.

283
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,806
I don't wanna go back there.

284
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:53,686
Whatever. Good. This day has been
a bust anyway. I'm out.

285
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,292
What?

286
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,212
I don't have a place to stay.

287
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,674
Do I look like a real estate
tycoon to you?

288
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,054
How many dead presidents you got?

289
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,932
Nuggets? Shorts?

290
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,434
Show me the money.

291
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,815
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

292
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,484
No, I'm thinking something else.

293
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,947
I'm let you buy me a pizza.

294
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,925
I've been doing this for
ten years, Bob. I said 10%.

295
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,470
We need to close the deal.
Hold on a second.

296
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,848
No. We said 10%.

297
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,644
Yeah, well, it makes the world
go around, doesn't it, Bob?

298
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:20,356
Just get me the 10%, will you?

299
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,232
Thanks.

300
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,486
Shit.

301
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:29,114
- Need anything, sir?
- Do you know any hit men?

302
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,938
I do know a bass player who
might be able to help you out.

303
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,286
Likes to get in fights
with lead singers.

304
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,623
Nick?

305
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,001
What are you doing, man?

306
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,798
I'm still driving. Paying off those
wedding bills from last year.

307
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,384
Oh, fair play to you.
She's a nice girl.

308
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,553
So, you playing at all?

309
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,263
Nope.

310
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,808
Why the hell not?
Your fingers fall off?

311
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,394
Well, you move on.

312
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,399
What about the lads?
Seen any of them lately?

313
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,152
We still mess around, but...

314
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:11,156
the "Connelly Brothers" never really
bounced back minus one brother.

315
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,204
You seen Marshall lately?

316
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,581
Have you?

317
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,294
It's my birthday on Saturday.

318
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,048
Session's at my place.
Come, bring your girlfriend.

319
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:32,678
It's great seeing you, man.
Reminds me of New York.

320
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,014
The good old days, eh?

321
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,441
I know!

322
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,609
I know.

323
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,238
I know. Okay, I don't know.

324
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:55,117
F? R Elise, by Beethoven.
And you should know that one.

325
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,119
Oh yeah.

326
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,204
Will you be our teacher forever,
Miss Novacek?

327
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,875
Well, at least until your
old teacher comes back.

328
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,462
But only if you call me...

329
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,089
- Lyla!
- That's right.

330
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,258
- You're crazy, Miss Novacek.
- Megan?

331
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,218
Got everything?

332
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,597
Bye!

333
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,189
Thanks!

334
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,401
There you are.
Now before you say no...

335
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,235
okay, picture this.

336
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:35,908
You onstage, me accompanying,
thousands of people.

337
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:37,284
- Liz.
- The New York Philharmonic.

338
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:40,204
I just got the invite.
They want you back.

339
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,040
It's just one night,
but they want you back.

340
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,710
I don't want to be up there.

341
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,504
Lyla.

342
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,632
When are you gonna let
yourself be happy again?

343
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,801
I am happy.

344
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:58,388
I'm talking about when
everyone else goes home.

345
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,939
Look...

346
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,817
Look. I know. Okay? I know.

347
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:17,116
Just think about it. You're a music
teacher who doesn't play any more.

348
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,993
Call me crazy.

349
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,788
Okay, Crazy.
I'll see you at home. Okay?

350
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,748
An right.

351
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,220
Nah. I ain't got no daddy.

352
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,347
See, my pops was a drunk.

353
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:45,018
And my mama, she took off with
this crackhead named Little Jesus.

354
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:48,230
But, you know, he wasn't no Little
Jesus, you know what I'm saying?

355
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,150
Nah. They never gave
a damn about me.

356
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,277
Come on, man!

357
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,863
This is us right here.

358
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:01,160
- I've been with Wizard for years.
- Who's Wizard?

359
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,537
He's a real piece of work,
that's what he is.

360
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,873
His real name is
Maxwell Wallace.

361
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,501
He took me in. He said
that I was an investment.

362
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,880
He gave me Roxy here.
He bought it in the old days.

363
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,550
Well, he really didn't buy it.
Guess you'd kind of say he found it.

364
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,177
All right, he stole it.

365
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,304
Wizard, he gave me his
place at the Square.

366
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,015
My parents?
They ain't give me nothing.

367
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,187
We all going be big stars someday.

368
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,023
What's the password?

369
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,816
Open the damn door already.

370
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,320
You getting on my nerves
is the password.

371
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,242
Okay, follow me.

372
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:48,207
What's your name again?
It's Evan, right?

373
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:54,588
This is our home, son. It's kind of
crazy in here, so stay on your feet.

374
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:02,512
Yeah, I been living here
for a while. Come on, man.

375
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,962
- So, how much money you make today?
- I made ten dollars.

376
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,603
- I am not lying.
- What'd I tell you about that?

377
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,609
I'll be laughing
at your funeral!

378
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,861
I'm going to go play basketball.

379
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,659
My life, the sky
Like a feather I'll fly.

380
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,079
Man, you should've knocked him
on his head or something.

381
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,348
Pizza!

382
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,290
You better hurry
before Wizard shows.

383
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,167
He'll be pissed if he'd
seen you bought a pie.

384
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,587
I ain't take no family money.
Citizen bought it.

385
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,218
Hello, music lovers!

386
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:25,470
Ah, while the cat's away...

387
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:29,224
Who likes pizza?

388
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,894
Who did this?

389
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,356
Arthur?

390
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,697
- What is he?
- He's a damn fool!

391
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,365
He's a damn fool!

392
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,326
He's gonna get it good.

393
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,995
What are you, Arthur?

394
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,456
I'm a real piece of work, Wizard.

395
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:55,959
You're on thin ice.

396
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,796
I didn't take no family money!
He bought it.

397
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,220
What?

398
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,889
You look crazy.

399
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,516
I am crazy.

400
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,229
SEE?

401
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,399
Come here.

402
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,944
Now!

403
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,364
Come on.

404
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:29,826
What's your name?

405
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,745
Evan, sir.

406
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,955
What are you doing here?

407
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,458
I followed the music.

408
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,758
Where'd you pick this one up,
Arthur? Bellevue?

409
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,764
You never played
a note in your life.

410
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,767
Do you know what music is?

411
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:59,356
God's reminder there's something
else besides us in this universe.

412
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,568
Harmonic connection between
all living beings everywhere...

413
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:05,862
even the stars.

414
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,240
Is this a school?

415
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:11,618
Yeah, the school of "Screw you
and take all your damn money".

416
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,788
- Yeah, we're top of the class!
- Not!

417
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,334
It's a business.

418
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,380
Pockets!

419
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,383
Pockets!

420
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:33,807
Peanut. Well done.

421
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,810
I got eyes in the
back of my head.

422
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,312
Good job.

423
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:42,440
Chain is only as strong...

424
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,650
as its weakest link.

425
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,863
Come on, Arthur.

426
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,781
That's chump change.

427
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:53,076
You got Washington Square.
That was my spot for ten years.

428
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,292
Go ahead, before I change my mind.

429
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,590
You kids are gonna put me
in the poorhouse.

430
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,330
All right, little mice, scurry back
to your holes. Go, go!

431
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,183
Harmonic dreams, sweet children.

432
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:49,628
Roxanne!
Man, I'm gonna kill him!

433
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,865
You know what's out there?

434
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:21,493
A series of higher tones.

435
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,328
It's arranged by nature...

436
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:27,374
it's governed by the laws of
physics of the whole universe.

437
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,461
It's an overtone, it's an energy,
it's a wavelength.

438
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:35,799
And if you're not riding it,
good Lord, you'll never hear it.

439
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,301
Where do you think
it comes from?

440
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,471
What I hear?

441
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:45,308
I think it comes from all around you,
really. I mean, it's...

442
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,560
Comes through us, some of us.

443
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,524
It's invisible, but you feel it.

444
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:55,568
So, only some of us can hear it?

445
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,239
Only some of us are listening.

446
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,244
Do you think my parents
are listening?

447
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,038
I hear you, kid.

448
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,085
Like?

449
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,546
Yeah.

450
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:21,094
Are you hearing a word I'm saying?

451
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,558
Louis!

452
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,728
Come on.
It's about time I met your family.

453
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,736
Listen, Jen, maybe this
isn't such a good idea.

454
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,531
Grow up. Come on.

455
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:44,909
Come on.

456
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:51,291
- The angel on the stairs.
- Are all Irish people this loud?

457
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:53,333
Yeah.

458
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,588
Will tell you I was there.

459
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:04,387
Under the full moon's light
On the mystery night

460
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:15,982
I been sitting, watching life
pass from the sidelines.

461
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:24,616
Been waiting for a dream
To seep in through my blinds.

462
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,744
Hey, Marshall, your brother's here.

463
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:30,580
Louis!

464
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,416
Hey, Nick.

465
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:37,587
Oh my God!

466
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,590
Is that you?

467
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:45,011
When were you gonna tell me
you were in a band?

468
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:50,683
I'm sure there's a lot of things
our Louis hasn't told you, darling.

469
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:54,270
- Like who'd you write the song for?
- I told you this was a mistake.

470
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:57,398
That's it, go on.
Walk out on us again.

471
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,237
- Hey, Louis.
- Say what you gotta say.

472
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,530
Come on, say what you
have to say.

473
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,990
- Come on, say it. Come on.
- That the best you got?

474
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,827
- Come on, say it!
- That the best you got, man?

475
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,204
Come on! Hit me!
Come on, hit me!

476
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,706
Feel what? Come on! Hit me!

477
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,209
I'm suffocating in here!

478
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,467
You all right, man?

479
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,388
You all right, man?

480
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:30,890
Welcome to the Connelly clan.

481
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,233
Jennifer.

482
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,261
You know, it was good having
the old Louis back in there...

483
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:11,180
even if it was only for a second.

484
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,309
Louie...

485
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,562
aren't you supposed to be
in the car with the girl...

486
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:19,772
as she drives off into the sunset?

487
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,034
Get your suit dirty
sitting there, man.

488
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:50,053
This is a message for Lyla Novacek.
Please call Good Samaritan Hospital.

489
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:53,348
I'm calling about your father,
Thomas Novacek.

490
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,610
I wasn't sure you
were going to come.

491
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:09,321
My will is in the top drawer
of the desk in my study.

492
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:11,282
Dad, stop, come on.

493
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:13,952
Lyla, please...

494
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,120
there's more.

495
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:28,675
All I ever wanted for you to have
all that promise, all that life.

496
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:31,260
But you were so young.

497
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:34,389
We had so much work to do.
You weren't ready.

498
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,933
That's plenty, Dad. Really.

499
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:42,105
I mean, a baby, that...
A baby, he could have hurt you.

500
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:49,362
He could've hurt you, and I wasn't
going to let that happen, Lyla.

501
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:56,995
I made a choice for us.

502
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,208
Oh my God!

503
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,878
A choice for us.

504
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,465
Wait...

505
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,472
I'm sorry.

506
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:22,478
Where?

507
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,400
Where is he?

508
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,902
I didn't mean...

509
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:31,738
Where is he?

510
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,364
I don't know.

511
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:37,201
I don't.

512
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,880
You gotta love music
more than you love food.

513
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:53,384
More than life.
More than yourself.

514
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,100
You feel it?

515
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,230
Then, show me.

516
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,232
Play it for your parents.

517
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,492
You're flying, kid.

518
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,089
You know what I'm thinking?

519
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,592
You're supposed to say:
What are you thinking, Wizard?

520
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,761
What are you thinking, Wizard?

521
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:21,806
I'll teach you everything
I know for free.

522
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,059
You get Roxanne.
You get my corner of the Park.

523
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:28,146
You get to keep half your tips.
We're like a team.

524
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:32,191
There's something wrong
with that picture.

525
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:34,694
What?

526
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,989
I don't think performing in parks
and corners is gonna be enough.

527
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,322
It won't?

528
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:43,451
Evan.

529
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:47,790
We're gonna need get you a new name.
Something with a little more pop.

530
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,168
I mean, in the whole world,
what do you want to be?

531
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:53,546
Close your eyes and
think about that.

532
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:57,800
Found.

533
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:04,307
Doesn't have enough "yin".

534
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:07,310
Little more "yang", you know?

535
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,187
Yeah, let's see.

536
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:12,565
Talk about wishful thinking.

537
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:14,566
See that?

538
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,822
What name stands out
to you on that?

539
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:21,073
Beach?

540
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:23,576
It's a good name for a band,
but not for a performer.

541
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,286
You can't say:
Please, welcome Beach.

542
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:28,371
No. August Rush!

543
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:31,250
August Rush. Doesn't that
warm you up a little bit?

544
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:35,004
I can see it:
Wizard Productions presents...

545
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:37,840
the number one heat wave...

546
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,552
"August Rush!"

547
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:46,223
It's me! Yeah! August! August!

548
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:49,060
It gives me a rush!
That gives me chills!

549
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,854
The hair on the back of my neck's
standing up. Look at that.

550
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:54,273
Quick, check it out. Yeah!

551
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:56,943
Yeah! August!

552
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:59,862
- August Rush!
- August Rush! August Rush!

553
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:01,364
That's you!

554
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,872
New York, Lyla?
What are you doing in New York?

555
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:55,250
Lizzy, I mean, I've always
felt that he was alive.

556
00:54:55,251 --> 00:55:00,256
I see kids that would be his age,
and I imagine what he'd look like.

557
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,426
- Big blue eyes like his dad, and...
- Oh my God, Lyla.

558
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:08,221
Lizzy, I used to lie in bed at night
and I swear I could hear him.

559
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,100
- I swear I could hear him.
- Lyla, calm down.

560
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:13,144
Calm down?! How can I be calm?

561
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:14,937
How can I be calm?

562
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:18,441
I've been calm for over ten years,
and look where it's gotten me!

563
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:20,735
Lyla, you're losing it.

564
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:24,488
You're right.
And maybe it's about time.

565
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,467
Don't do anything crazy,
okay, sweetie?

566
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,172
We're on our honeymoon,
but We're leaving.

567
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,536
We'll get there
as soon as we can, okay?

568
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:53,726
Okay, Jack, he's worth three times
what you're offering him, okay?

569
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,687
- You heard him in the Park!
- Wallace, you're a pain in the ass!

570
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,356
250 if he can play for
two hours straight.

571
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:01,442
- No, five, or he walks.
- 500?!

572
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:05,029
- I'll give him 250...
- 500 or he walks, all right?

573
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:08,491
- He walks?
- We have lightning in a bottle!

574
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,494
No parents. I'm his guardian.

575
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:14,497
I'm his representation,
that's why I'm making the deal.

576
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:16,916
May I help you?

577
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:19,251
I'm trying to find my son.

578
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:21,545
Name?

579
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,928
Mommy!

580
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,440
I don't know.

581
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,959
I'm sorry, ma'am, we're closing.

582
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:04,380
Please, I just,
I want to know his name.

583
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:09,802
To even consider re-establishing
contact with a child...

584
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:14,056
there is a detailed process.
I don't care about your process!

585
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:16,058
Okay?!

586
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:36,287
Ma'am, we're closed.
Come back tomorrow.

587
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:41,374
Lyla.

588
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:44,336
Novacek.

589
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:49,842
- Hi, this is Lyla...
- And Lizzy...

590
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:52,845
and we're not here right now.
So, leave a message.

591
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,950
Arthur!

592
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,620
What'd I tell you about
talking to strangers?

593
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,663
Yeah, what's your name?

594
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,415
My name is Mr. Jeffries.
And yours?

595
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:24,335
Arthur. We ain't strangers now.

596
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:29,131
Look, Mr. Wallace,
I'm here making my normal rounds.

597
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,674
I'm trying to find these kids.

598
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:34,344
This girl, her name is Geralda,
she should be about 14 now.

599
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:35,679
Don't know her, Mr. Jeffries.

600
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:38,933
Okay, well, maybe you can help me
with this young man.

601
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:43,103
Little boy that came up missing
recently. His name is Evan Taylor.

602
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:45,856
He's about 12.

603
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:51,862
And what if I find this Evan
and I turn him over to you?

604
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:53,656
What then?

605
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,408
You don't care about a kid
after he's in the system.

606
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:59,662
- It's not like that for...
- I know exactly what it's like.

607
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:01,664
You don't follow up.

608
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:03,832
And you throw him
from place to place.

609
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:07,545
Eventually you end up in a place
where they kick the crap out of you.

610
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:10,256
Go to bed at night and...

611
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:14,927
he tries to close his eyes,
ears, shut out the world.

612
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,972
What happens to that kid?
What do you think he hears?

613
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,933
What do you think he hears?!

614
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:24,728
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

615
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:29,649
Are you all right?

616
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:31,860
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- He's good!

617
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,746
14th Precinct.
Sergeant O'Malley.

618
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,417
No. That doesn't cut it.

619
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,170
NO!

620
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,800
Oh, is that final?! Okay,
here's my final offer: We're history!

621
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:58,470
- Deal's off.
- But I wanna play.

622
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:02,891
You play when I say play. Breathe
when I say breathe. You got that?

623
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,518
But I have to play.

624
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,687
Wizard, I need them to hear!

625
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:11,317
You forget about your parents!
They were quick to forget about you.

626
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,992
You don't know how
it could be for you.

627
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:22,828
You do not know how
precious your gift is.

628
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:25,581
You're just a kid,
you don't know.

629
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:32,838
I do, August.

630
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,313
- Wizard! Wizard!
- Talk to me. What happened?

631
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:52,107
It's Arthur.
The cops chased him back here.

632
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:55,027
- Okay, split up. You know the drill.
- We gotta help Arty.

633
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,279
Forget about Arty.
Arty's on his own. That's the book.

634
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,530
NO!

635
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,283
- August! August!
- Grab him! Grab him! There he goes!

636
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:20,302
Up there! You see him? See him?

637
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:24,556
Hey, you! Cops! Cops!

638
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,810
Cops! Over here!

639
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,907
Listen, you can't let
the cops catch you.

640
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:44,618
If they do, you don't tell them
your real name...

641
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:48,372
because they'll send you right back
where you came from, you got that?

642
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:53,085
I don't want to lose you. But if we
get separated, we meet at the arch.

643
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:57,715
Do not tell them your name.

644
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,593
When I say run, you run, okay?

645
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:10,102
Let me see your hands.

646
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,352
Now!

647
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,023
Run, August! Run, August!

648
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:17,359
Run!

649
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:30,205
Hey, kid, stop!

650
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:36,962
Open the door!

651
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:13,164
How I don't need that man
But they don't understand.

652
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,793
There's far too many
questions in reality.

653
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,922
Dealing with the pain of stress
And poverty.

654
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:26,804
And I gotta be myself
Because there's nobody else for me.

655
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,514
Hang in there with me.

656
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:31,725
Sometimes it takes a different
kind of love to raise a child.

657
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:35,354
So don't give up
When pressures come down.

658
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:38,774
Sometimes it takes a different
kind of dream to make you smile.

659
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:42,276
So raise it up
Hang in there with me.

660
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:45,531
Sometimes we need another
helping hand to show the way.

661
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:49,117
So don't give up
When pressures come down.

662
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:54,206
Sometimes it seems impossible
That's why we pray.

663
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,668
Seems to be nothing left for me.

664
01:03:57,876 --> 01:04:00,504
Mama's gone
Daddy didn't wanna be.

665
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:05,008
Now I'm all by myself
wondering where is love.

666
01:04:05,217 --> 01:04:07,302
Or should I just give up, you know.

667
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:11,265
Life falls down on me
Cuts into my soul.

668
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:14,977
But I know I got the strength
to make it through it all.

669
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:18,689
Cause I'm still standing tall
Breaking through these walls

670
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:21,817
I'm gonna give my all, hey

671
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:25,237
I'm feeling like a motherless child.

672
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,031
Pain cuts into my soul.

673
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:31,743
It's beaten me down
Can't find a smile.

674
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:34,413
On the face of a motherless child.

675
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:40,252
Gonna break down these walls
Gonna give my all.

676
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:47,509
Sometimes it takes a different
kind of love to raise a child.

677
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:50,888
So don't give up
When pressures come down.

678
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:54,307
Sometimes it takes a different
kind of dream to make you smile.

679
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:57,811
So raise it up
Hang in there with me.

680
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:01,314
Sometimes it takes another's
helping hand to show you the way.

681
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:04,735
So don't give up
When pressures come down.

682
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:08,906
Sometimes it seems impossible
That's why we pray.

683
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:18,290
Hi.

684
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:21,710
I know how this looks, you know.

685
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,295
I'm not crazy.

686
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:26,548
Nobody thinks you're crazy.
What's your name?

687
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:28,926
Lyla Novacek.

688
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,302
Well, it's like the woman
explained to you.

689
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:33,863
- You fill out a couple forms...
- No, no, six months, they said.

690
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:36,391
I don't have six months for forms.

691
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,269
Then, I can't help you there.

692
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:43,273
Explain something to me now.
Why now?

693
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:47,611
Why not before? Why is it so
important that you want him now?

694
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,906
I've always wanted him.

695
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:57,537
I've waited 11 years,
two months, and 15 days...

696
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:00,582
to find out that he's alive.

697
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,796
I've been counting.

698
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:25,273
- Hi, this is Lyla...
- And Lizzy...

699
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:28,151
and we're not here right now.
So leave a message.

700
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:40,122
When the one thing you're looking for
Is nowhere to be found.

701
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:46,336
And you're back-stepping
all of your moves.

702
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:48,380
Trying to figure it out.

703
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,923
What are you waiting for?

704
01:06:50,132 --> 01:06:53,885
You see, I know this girl that lives
across the street. Lyla Novacek.

705
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:56,388
I've been standing outside
here waiting, you know?

706
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:57,889
I wrote her a song.

707
01:06:58,098 --> 01:07:01,393
Oh, the musician.
She keeps me up half the night.

708
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:05,397
But I haven't seen her in a few days.
She's off on her honeymoon.

709
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,193
Thanks.

710
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:15,407
And you want give up
You want to give in.

711
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:20,829
Your head's wrapped around
What's around the next bend.

712
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:24,332
You wish you could find
something warm.

713
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:27,210
Because you're shivering cold.

714
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:38,680
But it's the first thing you see
As you open your eyes.

715
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,474
The last thing you say.

716
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:43,518
As you're saying goodbye.

717
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:50,233
But something inside you
Is crying and driving you on.

718
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,402
And this isn't your signature.

719
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:58,658
You do realize that he's probably
placed with a family, correct?

720
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,703
Do you have children,
Mr. Jeffries?

721
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,880
I did.

722
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,300
Then you know.

723
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,309
What's his birthday?

724
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:27,312
December 17th, 1995.

725
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:30,315
Yeah, I know.

726
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:44,955
Excuse me a minute.

727
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:15,527
This is him.

728
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,533
Yeah.

729
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:02,365
You're the one slept under my bed?

730
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:09,289
Do you live here?

731
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,209
Me and my grandma do,
till our boat comes in.

732
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,546
Do you like music?

733
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,258
More than food.

734
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:24,137
Do you know your notes?

735
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,224
I've never seen them
like that before.

736
01:10:27,225 --> 01:10:28,600
See here.

737
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:33,271
Every Good Boy Does Fine.

738
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:35,857
On the lines. And...

739
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:40,236
F-A-C-E, in-between.

740
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:44,366
And Great Big Dogs Fight Animals...

741
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:48,286
and All Cars Eat Gas.

742
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:50,080
Get it?

743
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,706
You're like an angel.

744
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:54,376
Okay. I gotta go.

745
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:56,336
Gotta go to school.

746
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:02,801
Can I borrow this?

747
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:06,012
Later.

748
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:35,101
Holy...

749
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:40,398
Reverend James!

750
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,304
You're not gonna believe this,
Reverend J! Come quick!

751
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:12,597
Slow down, Hope.

752
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:14,682
You've gotta see what's happened.

753
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:39,373
Remember in Music Appreciation
we had a class on Mozart?

754
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:41,418
Remember you said he was
like a musical "pod"?

755
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:43,837
- Prodigy.
- Exactly!

756
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:47,006
Well, I have one of those,
and he's living under my bed.

757
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:58,435
So, I showed him the scales and
when I came home, he was...

758
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:34,888
Mr. Jeffries, hi.
It's Lyla Novacek again.

759
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:37,265
I was just checking in.

760
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:41,644
Right, I understand.

761
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:46,858
You know, if there's any more
information or... just call.

762
01:15:00,914 --> 01:15:02,457
I'll take it.

763
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:05,293
How long do you think
you'll be staying?

764
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:08,379
As long as it takes.

765
01:15:29,776 --> 01:15:31,069
Sorry.

766
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,197
I don't know, Lizzy.
It's like...

767
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:38,952
I just woke up and I should
start playing again.

768
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:40,912
I should play.

769
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:44,749
I know it sounds crazy,
but maybe he'll hear me.

770
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:03,309
Hey, Marshall. It's me.

771
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:07,188
I'm in New York.

772
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:11,442
Is the band still minus
one mad Connelly brother?

773
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:15,280
Having you guys here
it'd be great, you know?

774
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:17,532
Just an idea.

775
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:19,366
Hey, Frank!

776
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:20,910
It's Louis.

777
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,328
Louis Connelly.

778
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:24,789
And?

779
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:29,711
I played here with me band a couple
a years ago. About ten years ago.

780
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:34,424
Hey, listen, Frank!

781
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:38,636
I'm going to play you one song,
all right? Just one song.

782
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:42,348
And if you don't like it,
you can throw me out.

783
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:01,451
You brought us a prodigy,
Reverend.

784
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:03,411
He is a mystery.

785
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:07,373
Dean, I thought he was an angel.

786
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:11,628
There's no record of an
August Rush anywhere.

787
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:16,049
It's about foundation, starting
with a very simple, orderly chord.

788
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:19,093
As you open your eyes.

789
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:23,806
The last thing you say
As you're saying goodbye.

790
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:26,351
But something inside you.

791
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:31,356
Is crying and driving you on

792
01:17:40,073 --> 01:17:43,451
Lyla. Just relax.

793
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,286
You're pushing yourself too hard.

794
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,455
I don't know if I can do this.

795
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:52,710
You're playing with the Philharmonic.
That's great.

796
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:56,255
Okay, let's keep going.

797
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:07,475
Start with a C major chord,
then a modulation to G.

798
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:10,978
Once we get to G,
you go back to C, very simple.

799
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,940
And we go C, G, C.

800
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:23,366
From the very beginning,
C major chord.

801
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:27,495
We have this chaotic evolution
into a remote G major.

802
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:44,178
What's this? August?

803
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,265
The diminished fifth, sir.

804
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:48,933
Key change here.

805
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,978
And then the rise with
those round horns...

806
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:56,274
the oboes, into the
allegro staccato strings.

807
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,656
Mr. Rush.

808
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:08,911
I'm sorry.

809
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:11,289
Why are you apologizing, August?

810
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:16,294
Sometimes I don't listen and I don't
do homework like I'm supposed to.

811
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:19,005
Well, I'm sure you'll
do better in the future.

812
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:33,144
The New York Philharmonic Orchestra
is having a concert.

813
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,563
In the history of this school...

814
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:38,053
we've never performed the work
of a first year student...

815
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:41,027
and certainly no one of your age.

816
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:45,114
But now, we've asked them if they
could perform your rhapsody.

817
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:46,574
Would you like that?

818
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:50,452
Oh! Good. Good.

819
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:52,163
How many people will hear it?

820
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:58,628
Well, it would be performed in
Central Park, on the Great Lawn.

821
01:19:58,878 --> 01:19:59,879
A hundred?

822
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,800
Much more. Thousands.

823
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:08,262
Okay. Because I need to play it
to a lot of people. Lots and lots.

824
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:11,682
We'll see what we can do to help.

825
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,938
August, three artists
will be performing...

826
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,440
and you will be featured last.

827
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:37,041
How do you do it?
How does the music come to you?

828
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,837
I just hear it.

829
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,572
Sometimes I wake up
and it's there...

830
01:20:46,634 --> 01:20:49,637
or I hear it when I'm
walking down the street.

831
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,896
It's like someone is
calling out to me.

832
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:02,984
Writing it all down is like
I'm calling back to them.

833
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:04,235
Who?

834
01:21:05,862 --> 01:21:08,072
The ones who gave me the music.

835
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:16,976
You sure you're ready
for this, Louis?

836
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,875
Are you?

837
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:20,895
Bravo, August!

838
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:24,899
Good one!

839
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:32,490
August.
Boy, you're a hard guy to find.

840
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,620
- Been looking everywhere for you.
- Excuse me.

841
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:41,165
- You're interrupting a rehearsal.
- A rehearsal, right!

842
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:42,625
And you are?

843
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:44,335
Come here to me, son.

844
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:55,763
Come here.

845
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:00,685
What'd they do to you?

846
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:03,521
Nothing.

847
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:08,192
These people could
steal your soul.

848
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,320
Sir, whoever you are,
you don't have the right!

849
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:14,573
I'm his father, all right?
I have every right.

850
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:21,247
I'll take you home now. Come on.

851
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:25,126
But I have a concert.
I like it here.

852
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:27,837
- He's a remarkable boy...
- You don't think I know that?!

853
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:30,297
What'd you do, you just
snatched him up off the street?

854
01:23:30,298 --> 01:23:31,799
That gives you the right?

855
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,593
Wait a moment, we've been
teaching him here.

856
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:39,807
What are you gonna do? Fill his head
with classical theory and rules?

857
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:42,768
You can't learn music from books!

858
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:44,770
It's out there.

859
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:48,232
You teach him?!

860
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:52,278
He teaches you.
You learn from him!

861
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,031
We are. I assure you,
Mr. Rush, every day.

862
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:57,908
Come on.
You should be with family.

863
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:03,039
Mr. Rush, please!

864
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:06,087
Do you've any idea of the importance
of the concert tomorrow for August?

865
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:09,336
August. Wait, listen.

866
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,798
You gotta tell me right now:
Is this man really your father?

867
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,972
You can tell me the truth.

868
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:22,516
I know your real name.

869
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:25,186
Evan.

870
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:27,146
August.

871
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:29,315
Evan.

872
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,360
Is he your father?

873
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:40,242
He taught me everything I know.

874
01:24:52,797 --> 01:24:56,008
And we are back, we are back.

875
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:02,431
Don't make it harder for yourself,
Aug. Wizard's not so bad.

876
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:07,812
You saw the kid, right? He's a freak
of nature. Okay, here's the deal:

877
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,420
Thousand a night, two weeks minimum,
three cities guaranteed.

878
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,900
Then we ship him out to your
partner on the West Coast.

879
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:15,903
He just ain't feeling well.

880
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:19,156
He said you the only one who
gonna make him feel better.

881
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:30,251
Competition. All right,
I'll be back. You do what you do.

882
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:44,047
I'm his representation.
That's why I'm making the deal.

883
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:47,893
Come on. No, there's no parents.

884
01:26:18,174 --> 01:26:19,592
Great sounds, kid.

885
01:26:22,428 --> 01:26:24,096
Gibson J-200?

886
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:27,099
It's beautiful.

887
01:26:27,558 --> 01:26:28,976
Can I see her?

888
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:35,191
It's okay.

889
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,902
I'm a musician, too.

890
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,387
Nice action.

891
01:27:06,347 --> 01:27:07,431
You're pretty good.

892
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:10,351
Thanks.

893
01:27:11,352 --> 01:27:12,853
See what you can do with mine.

894
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:09,345
How long you been playing?

895
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:11,138
Six months.

896
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:15,726
Six months? How'd you learn how
to play like that in six months?

897
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:17,394
Juilliard.

898
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:20,356
Juilliard?

899
01:29:20,773 --> 01:29:24,193
Yes, sir. I have my
own concert tonight.

900
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:26,737
So you reckon
I should believe you?

901
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,449
Yeah. But I can't go.

902
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,326
Why's that?

903
01:29:33,077 --> 01:29:34,953
It's kind of a long story.

904
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:41,794
Well, if I went to Juilliard
and I had a concert tonight...

905
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:44,380
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

906
01:29:45,506 --> 01:29:46,673
Yeah.

907
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:54,681
But what if something bad
would happen if you did it?

908
01:29:56,392 --> 01:29:58,560
You never quit on your music.

909
01:29:59,353 --> 01:30:01,271
No matter what happens.

910
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:05,192
Because anytime something bad
happens to you...

911
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:09,405
it's the one place you can
escape to and just let it go.

912
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,409
I learned that the hard way.

913
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:17,371
And anyway, look at me...

914
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:20,541
nothing bad's gonna happen.

915
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:23,210
Gotta have a little faith.

916
01:30:34,388 --> 01:30:35,388
I'm Louis.

917
01:30:36,432 --> 01:30:40,060
Ev... August. August Rush.

918
01:30:40,853 --> 01:30:42,646
August Rush.

919
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:45,524
Cool name.

920
01:30:45,816 --> 01:30:46,816
August!

921
01:30:47,818 --> 01:30:49,445
Come on!

922
01:30:52,406 --> 01:30:54,283
I gotta go, August.

923
01:31:00,706 --> 01:31:01,748
Bye.

924
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,126
Yeah.

925
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:07,337
Bye.

926
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:19,141
Bye.

927
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:40,370
Yes, I made him memorize our number.

928
01:31:42,623 --> 01:31:46,126
I understand. Your department's
doing everything they can.

929
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:07,606
Do you think anything bad
happened to him?

930
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:10,150
I'm sure he's fine.

931
01:32:11,193 --> 01:32:13,278
I prayed for him. Did you?

932
01:32:14,363 --> 01:32:15,364
Yeah.

933
01:32:17,366 --> 01:32:19,952
Well, if his father loves him
like he should...

934
01:32:20,911 --> 01:32:23,997
then he'll do what's best
for his son.

935
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:27,417
You believe that, don't you?

936
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:29,419
Yeah.

937
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:32,214
Good. Now go get ready.

938
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,937
Welcome to our Concert
in the Park...

939
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:52,484
and the Mercedes Drive Your
Future Scholarship Celebration.

940
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:55,403
Now, it is with enormous pleasure...

941
01:32:55,404 --> 01:33:00,324
that I welcome back to the concert
stage one of Julliard's own...

942
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:02,160
Lyla Novacek.

943
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:02,804
So long you've been running in circles
around what's at stake.

944
01:34:05,766 --> 01:34:10,562
But now the time's come for your feet
to stand still in one place.

945
01:34:13,982 --> 01:34:17,736
You wanna reach out
You wanna give in.

946
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:21,865
Your head's wrapped around
what's around the next bend.

947
01:34:22,074 --> 01:34:24,451
You wish you could find
something warm.

948
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:27,412
Because you're shivering cold.

949
01:34:29,956 --> 01:34:33,794
It's the first thing you see
As you open your eyes.

950
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:37,756
The last thing you say
As you're saying goodbye.

951
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:43,261
Something inside you is crying
Driving you on.

952
01:34:44,888 --> 01:34:48,600
Because if you hadn't found me

953
01:34:49,309 --> 01:34:51,687
I would have found you

954
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:59,069
I would have found you

955
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:08,328
I have to go now.

956
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:23,343
I'm not coming back this time.

957
01:35:23,719 --> 01:35:26,012
He's just kidding, Wizard.

958
01:35:26,513 --> 01:35:29,182
Me and August have a understanding.
Don't we?

959
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:36,565
Aug, you can't leave me, man.

960
01:35:36,982 --> 01:35:38,442
Yes, I can.

961
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,987
Because you have to find
your parents, right?

962
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:44,823
Yeah. My concert's starting.

963
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:50,120
All my money's on the fact your
folks won't be able to find you.

964
01:35:50,287 --> 01:35:51,538
You know why?

965
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,584
Because they can't hear you.
Because they're probably dead.

966
01:35:55,959 --> 01:35:58,336
You're not going anywhere.

967
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:11,183
Nowhere to go, son.

968
01:36:22,194 --> 01:36:23,695
Run, boy!

969
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,740
Run, August, run!

970
01:36:32,412 --> 01:36:37,417
I would have found you

971
01:36:47,052 --> 01:36:49,012
August!

972
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:41,648
August!

973
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:04,254
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

974
01:38:05,255 --> 01:38:07,966
Music has always
fascinated us...

975
01:38:08,174 --> 01:38:12,929
in the way that it communicates,
without words...

976
01:38:13,179 --> 01:38:15,140
without pictures.

977
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:18,184
And that leads us to
our final performance.

978
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:24,274
Say, how much longer
to the airport?

979
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:26,902
Man, it's jammed up with traffic.

980
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:29,529
Bring you back to
the old days, Louis?

981
01:38:47,631 --> 01:38:49,132
August Rush.

982
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:51,092
Evan Taylor?

983
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:11,738
Unfortunately, our last
performer seems to...

984
01:39:11,947 --> 01:39:14,741
He's here. He's here. He's here!

985
01:39:16,326 --> 01:39:17,202
Oh! Excellent.

986
01:39:17,203 --> 01:39:22,331
Perhaps there's no one else who
can better personify the mystery...

987
01:39:22,332 --> 01:39:24,000
that is music...

988
01:39:24,626 --> 01:39:27,045
than our final composer.

989
01:41:19,032 --> 01:41:20,450
Hey, what's that?

990
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:23,286
Concerts in the Park
every spring.

991
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:52,732
Let me out.

992
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:56,486
Let me out! Let me out!

993
01:46:39,477 --> 01:46:42,021
The music is all around us.

994
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:45,775
All you have to do is listen.
