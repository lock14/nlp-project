1
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:39,634
# Hey, Mister Tambourine Man #

2
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:42,679
# Play a song for me #

3
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:46,725
- # In the jingle-jangle morning... #
- "B."

4
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:50,104
- # I'll come following... #
- "A."

5
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:52,023
You having fun, sweetheart?

6
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,194
Yes.

7
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,988
Ahh.

8
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:59,991
Well, I hope you're doing
better than me, baby.

9
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:02,578
- What are you making?
- A necklace for Mom.

10
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:04,829
Yeah? Let me see.

11
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:07,207
Wow. Another one?

12
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,835
- Yes.
- Woman: Honey?

13
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,670
That's two today.

14
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:13,548
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:15,132
Honey?

16
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,927
- Yeah?
- Waiting for the help to get that?

17
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:20,847
I thought you and I were the help.

18
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,936
- Go wash up for dinner, pumpkin.
- Okay.

19
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:28,566
Mmm, smells nice.
That takeout?

20
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:32,110
Mommy, look at-

21
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:41,996
No!

22
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:44,500
No! Ahh!

23
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,174
Oh! No no no!

24
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:54,801
You can't fight fate.

25
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:09,402
We gotta get the fuck out of here.
Come on!

26
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:14,032
Oh! Oh no!

27
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:19,455
Thug:
No!

28
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:22,334
- What the fuck are you doing?
- No!

29
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,795
Fucking stop!
Let's go!

30
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:26,963
Just shut the fuck up!

31
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,307
No!

32
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,819
It's cool.

33
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:47,487
Kids like me.

34
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:50,658
No! Heather!

35
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,204
No no!

36
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,854
- Nick.
- Bray, what's happenin'?

37
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:58,276
Willis is a rowing buddy of mine.
Where are we on his kid's case?

38
00:03:58,442 --> 00:03:59,860
- Willis?
- Yeah.

39
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:01,778
- Oh, I kicked it down to juvie.
- Why did you do that?

40
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:03,865
'Cause the case was a dog.
The kid was only 15 years old

41
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,657
when he committed the murder.

42
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:08,661
You wouldn't want to jeopardize
your 95% conviction rate.

43
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:10,788
- It's actually 96%.
- 96% now?

44
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:13,292
Yes. You gotta keep your books
better than that.

45
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,839
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were gunning for my job.

46
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,466
You do know better.

47
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,968
And you know that I'm aiming
much higher than that.

48
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,680
They filed a motion to dismiss,

49
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,682
but there's no way that
Judge Abrams honors it.

50
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:28,059
I think that we can
get him on RICO.

51
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,728
All that time and that's
what you come back with, Sarah?

52
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:33,730
You might want to reevaluate
your research skills.

53
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,733
- What else have we got?
- Nick: She's right.

54
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,026
Mr. Rice?

55
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,653
RICO's designed
for this kind of thing.

56
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,240
Check out section 901 of
the Organized Crime Control Act.

57
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,617
And you should let Sarah
try this case too.

58
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,786
Mr. Rice, last I checked,
I was running this room.

59
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,290
She's already done the leg-work.
I'll oversee it.

60
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,250
I mean, Helen Keller
could try this case.

61
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:56,007
Okay, Boy Wonder,
she fucks up, it's on you.

62
00:05:02,264 --> 00:05:04,100
Cantrell wants to see you.

63
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,560
All right, I'll be right there.

64
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:09,230
No, Nick.
He wants to see Nick.

65
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:11,940
You still torturing Bringham?

66
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:14,319
Let's just say I'm less impressed
with his Harvard degree than he is.

67
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:15,819
Well, we can't all have
gone to Fordham.

68
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:17,237
I went to Fordham night school.

69
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:19,615
You know what I learned
in Fordham night school?

70
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,076
Law school's got nothing
to do with law.

71
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:23,495
Guess you skipped the course
on inter-office politics.

72
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:26,417
All I need is a jury to like me.
Isn't that what you told me, Jonas?

73
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:29,461
The Shelton case-
where are we?

74
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,338
It went sideways last night-
Judge Burch.

75
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,882
Ahh.

76
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:34,843
Bad news. What now?

77
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,721
- Let's make the deal.
- They killed a little girl, Nick.

78
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:40,764
- It's an imperfect system.
- And we its imperfect servants.

79
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:44,519
- However you could win this case.
- No, can't take that chance.

80
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:47,314
Some justice is better
than no justice at all.

81
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,483
You need to tell the husband.

82
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,860
Okay.
That's part of my job.

83
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:54,988
Good, because he's waiting
for you right now.

84
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:56,824
What?

85
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:09,007
- How are you doing?
- Good. How are you doing?

86
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,759
Good. Sit. Sit.

87
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:14,428
Well, I didn't hear back from you

88
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:17,764
and made some notes
on the case.

89
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:20,851
I had some good ideas.

90
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,687
Yeah, let me
take a look at it.

91
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:26,065
Well, they're just-

92
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:33,699
I was gonna talk to you
about those.

93
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:37,079
Do you trust me?

94
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:42,127
Do you trust me, Clyde?

95
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:44,879
Yeah, of course.

96
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:50,761
Darby has agreed to testify
against Ames.

97
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,514
With Darby's testimony,

98
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,475
Ames will go
to death row.

99
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:03,483
Um, what about-
what about Darby then?

100
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:07,153
Darby will plead
guilty to murder.

101
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,992
- In what degree?
- Third.

102
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:12,619
He serves, what?
Five years...

103
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:15,372
at best?

104
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,418
I don't understand.
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:22,422
We had a setback. The judge ruled
that the DNA was inadmissible.

106
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:25,550
- What?
- Exclusionary rule.

107
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:27,552
The opposing counsel
maneuvered it.

108
00:07:27,718 --> 00:07:29,887
You said this part of
the case was clear-cut.

109
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,555
We had the blood on his shirt-

110
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:33,391
It's covered under
the same rule.

111
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:34,893
What about the rest of
the forensic evidence?

112
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,689
It's not conclusive, Clyde.

113
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:44,281
Okay, that's okay.
'Cause I saw- I saw their faces.

114
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:47,492
I saw them do it.
I mean, he killed my little girl, Nick.

115
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:50,536
You blacked out, Clyde.
Your testimony won't be reliable.

116
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,456
You get on the stand and
the defense will tear you apart.

117
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:56,043
No no, the jury's gonna
believe me though.

118
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,338
- Because it's the truth! We can-
- We can lose.

119
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:02,257
And then we'd have nothing.

120
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:04,802
You will waste a whole year,
spend millions of dollars,

121
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:06,887
and then both of them could
end up going free.

122
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:10,600
Nick, both of them are guilty,
especially Darby!

123
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,769
- You know that.
- It's not what you know, Clyde.

124
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:15,355
It's what you can
prove in court.

125
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:21,612
Please don't make a deal
with this man.

126
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,824
Please don't make a deal with this man.
He's a monster-

127
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:26,495
I'm sorry, the deal is done.
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:28,497
I made the deal.

129
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:31,625
What?
How could you do that?

130
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:35,379
This is just how
the justice system works.

131
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:39,633
Listen, I know you don't
think it right now,

132
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,552
but this is a victory for us.

133
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:48,475
Woman: Your office has certified
this agreement?

134
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:49,894
Yes, Your Honor.

135
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:53,942
Mr. Reynolds, any great insights
to share with the court today?

136
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:57,111
I'm a defense attorney, Your Honor.
I don't have many of those.

137
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:03,369
No, Your Honor.
No insights.

138
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:06,330
Good, then I trust that we can
move forward with Mr. Ames's trial

139
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:10,000
unimpeded by continuances.
A triaI date is imminent.

140
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,965
Yeah?

141
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:17,509
There's no cell phones
in my courtroom, Mr. Rice.

142
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:19,009
- We've been over this-
- I'm sorry.

143
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:20,302
and over this, over this...

144
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,139
Yeah, I had some
exigent business I-

145
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:25,269
Next time it's mine.

146
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:31,942
- Ah, you married?
- Excuse me?

147
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,111
Are you married?

148
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:39,243
Please fuck this up
so I can destroy you.

149
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:47,084
I wish ill for no man,

150
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,921
but Ames deserves to
suffer for what he did.

151
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:54,259
I mean, you can't
fight fate, right?

152
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,476
Nick.

153
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,229
Once you make a decisión,
live with it- move on.

154
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,565
This job, your best asset's
a short memory.

155
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,777
Don't beat yourself up. Too many other
people out there doing that already.

156
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,195
Look, there's some of them
right now.

157
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,322
Isn't this where you tell me
some type of old fable

158
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,284
or wives' tale-

159
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,288
All right, all right, I got one.

160
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,373
Marcus Aurelius hired a servant
to walk behind him

161
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,125
as he made his way through
the Roman town square.

162
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,376
And this servant's only job

163
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:28,212
was to whisper in his ear
when people praised him,

164
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,674
"You're only a man.
You're only a man. "

165
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,261
- Okay, man?
- Okay, man.

166
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:34,679
- Okay, man.
- That's some bullshit.

167
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:35,847
That's good.

168
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,307
I don't think you even know
what that story means.

169
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:39,602
You're missing the point, Nick.
It doesn't matter what they say.

170
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,270
Okay, I got this now.

171
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:47,068
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
one at a time, one at a time.

172
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:48,988
So you'll be seeking
the death penalty?

173
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:51,155
- For Rupert Ames, we will be.
- And for Darby?

174
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:53,826
He has pled guilty to murder,
but he is a cooperating witness.

175
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:56,370
The DA's office has committed
all of its resources

176
00:10:56,537 --> 00:10:59,038
to ensure that justice
will be served.

177
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:00,875
Did you make any kind of-

178
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,793
Do you think this is
a fair sentence for Darby?

179
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:09,345
I just wanted to say
thanks for being in my corner.

180
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:12,514
It's nice when
the system works, right?

181
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:14,808
Get away from me.

182
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,311
Officer:
Move. Move.

183
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,570
Let's go.

184
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:57,523
- Nick?
- Hey.

185
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,331
Nuh-uh, what happened?

186
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,750
What happened to what?

187
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:18,088
What's wrong?

188
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,426
You call my job boring. "C-"?

189
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:24,136
Yes.

190
00:12:25,263 --> 00:12:28,390
Well...
okay now...

191
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:30,434
you gonna tell me
what's wrong?

192
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,148
Can I talk to my daughter
for a little bit?

193
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:37,275
- Oh, please. No no no.
- Gonna lay down.

194
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:39,778
Please?

195
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:42,072
First of all,
this is your father speaking.

196
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,948
- Yeah, she didn't know that.
- You never know.

197
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:46,911
I want you to stay in there
as long as you can.

198
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:49,245
'cause there's a lot
of crazy-ass people out here.

199
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:51,167
Language.

200
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:54,379
Your mother's a hardass, but-

201
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:55,798
I'm right here.

202
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:59,552
And Daddy- Daddy wants you to
come out and be Daddy's little girl.

203
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:02,388
Woman: I want her to come out
'cause she's on my bladder.

204
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:04,389
Ahh!

205
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:08,019
Anybody seen my phone?

206
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:15,735
- Hey, have you seen my phone?
- It's not strapped to your hand?

207
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:17,861
No, it's not strapped to my hand.

208
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,740
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

209
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,366
You're not gonna have
some of my French toast?

210
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:23,284
- French toast? You made French toast?
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:26,331
I can't, honey.
I'm running late.

212
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:27,750
Okay.

213
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:31,004
All right, here- Mmm.

214
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:32,797
- Mmm, that's good.
- Thank you.

215
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,006
- You did this by yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:35,884
I'm just gonna take
this whole plate to work.

217
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,510
All right- no.

218
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:40,346
You're only 10 years old?

219
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:42,515
- You better than your mother.
- I heard that.

220
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:45,269
Smells good in here.
Your lifeline.

221
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:47,270
'Morning, baby.
Give me a kiss.

222
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:50,482
Mmm! You going to your daughter's
recitaI this afternoon?

223
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:55,363
Um, I thought you were gonna
order the DVDs.

224
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,197
Video's not the same, Nick.

225
00:13:57,365 --> 00:14:00,370
Mom, it's okay.
Dad's got to work, I know.

226
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:03,414
See? It's all right. Dad's got to work.
And what is Dad doing today?

227
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:05,250
- Lock up bad guys.
- And why does he do that?

228
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:06,753
- To keep us safe.
- Yeah.

229
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:09,839
She understands.
'Cause he wants us to be safe.

230
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:11,798
- Baby, get your cello.
- All right.

231
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,009
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

232
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:17,054
- Little Julia Child.
- Mmm.

233
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,767
You know she's
10 years old, right?

234
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,184
- You know that?
- I know that.

235
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:23,894
She doesn't understand why
you're never around.

236
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:26,063
This good-guy, bad-guy stuff-
that's just talk to her.

237
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,899
Don't do this, come on.

238
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,777
I can't come today.

239
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:32,115
You know you have not been
to one recitaI-

240
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:33,866
- How many has she had?
- Enough.

241
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,369
Okay.
Well, we'll get the video,

242
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:40,664
we'll sit down and we'll
watch it together as a family.

243
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:42,959
I love you.

244
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,418
All right?

245
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,671
- Thank you for the toast.
- Love you.

246
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:47,963
- Love you too!
- Bye.

247
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,051
Love you.

248
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:52,095
Huh.

249
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,014
- So how's Chip?
- It's Chester.

250
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,557
What happened to Chip?
I liked Chip.

251
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:58,350
There is no Chip.

252
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:00,894
And now there's no Chester.
He kept calling.

253
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:03,398
- Sarah, that's a good thing.
- I know, but I kept cancelling.

254
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:05,399
My caseload's crazy.

255
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:08,238
You know you don't have to
go to this if you don't want to.

256
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:10,948
Yeah, I do. I...

257
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:12,534
What's it like?

258
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,995
No biggie.
Like watching somebody fall asleep.

259
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,164
Except for
the not-waking-up part.

260
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:19,167
Does it bother you?

261
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,918
Not anymore.

262
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,014
Sarah, your legs are looking
real good in those heels.

263
00:16:10,181 --> 00:16:13,268
Fuck off.

264
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:16,063
What are you doing here, Reynolds?
Your DVD player broken?

265
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,650
Ames has no family. I felt like
someone should be here for him.

266
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,238
Wow, that's nice.

267
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,409
Breathe.

268
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:48,057
Rupert Ames, do you have
anything you want to say?

269
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:51,187
Yeah.

270
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:52,605
Uh-huh.

271
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:58,403
Ames:
What I did that night was wrong.

272
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:02,323
I should have never been there.

273
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,122
But I swear to God,
I didn't kill those people.

274
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,711
The wrong man's dying here today.

275
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:19,502
The wrong man's dying.

276
00:17:20,176 --> 00:17:22,261
That's all.

277
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,750
Look at me.

278
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:52,087
Look at me!

279
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,992
Ahh! Fuck!

280
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,538
Fuck!

281
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,709
Ahh! Fuck!

282
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,502
Oh, God.

283
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:08,008
- Oh, God.
- Take her- take her out.

284
00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:10,385
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

285
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:15,682
Ahhh!

286
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,048
What could have caused
the unexpected reaction of the inmate?

287
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,218
We'll keep you informed.

288
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:48,636
You okay? Huh?

289
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:50,471
Yeah.

290
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:54,434
So somebody killed the guy
you were trying to kill?

291
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:55,853
What are we calling this?

292
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:57,645
Clear violation of his
Eighth Amendment rights-

293
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,606
- cruel and unusual punishment.
- Law schooI.

294
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:01,983
Yeah. The machine-
how does it work on a good day?

295
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:04,319
It's designed to be pain-free.

296
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:07,030
It's three drugs administered
in a specific order.

297
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:09,367
From this point on, we're operating
under the assumption

298
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:10,952
that the machine was corrupted.

299
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:14,040
We're gonna need a list of all
the people with access to that machine.

300
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,794
- My people would not do this.
- I appreciate that, Warden,

301
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:20,338
but I'm gonna need more than
a hall pass and a note from Mom.

302
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:22,549
Detectives, got this off
the back of the machine.

303
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:24,969
- Check it out.
- Let me see it.

304
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:27,096
Right there.

305
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:29,097
"Can't fight fate. "

306
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:30,933
Cantrell:
What is it, Nick?

307
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:33,354
During the home invasión,
Ames's accomplice

308
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,689
said to one of the vics,
"You can't fight fate. "

309
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:39,151
And then he said the same thing
to me in the courtroom- prick.

310
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:42,028
I can't remember his name, though.

311
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:44,740
Have a look at this-
your guy?

312
00:20:44,906 --> 00:20:47,117
- Clarence James Darby.
- He's a cutie.

313
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:49,204
- You got history with him?
- Nick: Put him away.

314
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:52,083
All right, three years. That the going
rate for murder these days?

315
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,794
There was extenuating
circumstances.

316
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,256
The only extenuating circumstances
should be he didn't do it.

317
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,134
Still, three years at Marion?
Fucking gladiator academy.

318
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,094
You expect him to come back
a modeI citizen?

319
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,680
Well, if you scholars wouldn't
contaminate the crime scenes,

320
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,222
I could keep them
locked up longer.

321
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,433
Authorities have refused
to comment at this point,

322
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,560
but foul play cannot be ruled out.

323
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,271
The prisoner had been on death row
for the past 10 years-

324
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,898
his name, Rupert Ames.

325
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,442
All we know at this point

326
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,903
is what was supposed to be
a painless execution

327
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,867
has turned into something
out of a horror film.

328
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,167
Yeah?

329
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:32,420
- Clarence Darby?
- Who's this?

330
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:35,589
That's strike three for you:
coke on the table,

331
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:38,343
bitch on the floor- life in prison.

332
00:21:39,886 --> 00:21:41,971
Who the fuck is this?

333
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:44,849
Voice: Look out your window,
south side.

334
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:48,980
- Is this a joke? Get up!
- Ahh!

335
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:51,398
South side.

336
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:57,198
Motherfucker.

337
00:21:57,365 --> 00:22:00,160
Shit. Out of the way!

338
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:14,384
- Stay down!
- You're all crazy!

339
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,303
He's heading north!
Go go!

340
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,263
- Damn.
- Move it, move it. Go on!

341
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:31,153
- What now?
- Wipe the prints off the gun.

342
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,448
- Get rid of it.
- No no.

343
00:22:33,615 --> 00:22:37,326
You fired six times, genius.
You bring any ammunition?

344
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:39,203
- Lose it.
- Why are you doing this?

345
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:41,038
I want to keep you
out of prison.

346
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:43,958
See the abandoned factories?
Go toward them.

347
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,125
Why?

348
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:47,087
There's a cop car there
with a cop in it.

349
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:48,422
What the fuck?

350
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:51,217
I Tasered him, but he'll be waking up
in about 90 seconds,

351
00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:53,219
so you'd better move.

352
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:14,368
Rise and fucking shine, bitch.
Wake the fuck up!

353
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:16,371
Let's go!
Start the fucking car!

354
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:17,622
- Okay!
- Do it.

355
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:20,083
- Take it easy, take it-
- Come on!

356
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,917
- Okay, let's go.
- Take it easy.

357
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:24,962
Let's go!
Get in gear, shithead, now!

358
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,464
Do it! Go go go!

359
00:23:42,983 --> 00:23:45,194
Get the fuck out.

360
00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:52,618
Let's go.

361
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:54,746
Get the fuck down there!

362
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:58,917
Okay. What about my wife?
My little girl?

363
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:02,297
- I'll never see them again.
- Fucked up, ain't it?

364
00:24:02,462 --> 00:24:05,340
Oh oh oh.

365
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:07,926
You don't mind if
I take this, do you?

366
00:24:08,094 --> 00:24:10,346
My guardian ángel.

367
00:24:10,512 --> 00:24:12,351
I am impressed.

368
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:16,563
You know why I'll never see
my wife and little girl again?

369
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:23,529
'Cause you took 'em from me.

370
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:32,913
You remember me?

371
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:36,500
Sure you do.

372
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:39,378
You came over to my house
once before.

373
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,590
You don't remember?

374
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:47,973
This tetrodotoxin...

375
00:24:48,974 --> 00:24:51,478
should be nicely into
your system by now.

376
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:55,398
It's isolated from the liver
of a Caribbean puffer fish.

377
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:59,152
So it paralyzes you,

378
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:02,364
but leaves all the other
neurological functions

379
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,409
perfectly intact.

380
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:07,912
In other words, you can't move...

381
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,624
but you feel everything.

382
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:17,130
It does absolutely nothing
to blunt the pain.

383
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:20,090
And you're about to
experience more of that

384
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:22,637
than you could ever
fucking imagine.

385
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:34,067
These are tourniquets

386
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:38,320
so you don't bleed out,
'cause you may be here a while.

387
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:40,574
Saline solution-

388
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,285
that should keep us going.

389
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:47,538
Clamps- nice and secure.

390
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:51,586
Comfortable?

391
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:54,383
You really are shaking.

392
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:56,801
Sure you're all right?

393
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,222
You'll love this-

394
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,474
adrenaline.

395
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:07,729
Now this is so you
don't pass out.

396
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:11,483
There you go.

397
00:26:11,651 --> 00:26:14,820
How's that feel? Good?

398
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,451
Now what we don't want
is you swallowing your tongue,

399
00:26:19,617 --> 00:26:21,744
so bear with me.

400
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:31,632
Now this is for your penis,
but we'll get to that later.

401
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,512
Scalpel...

402
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,640
for your eyelids,

403
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,643
in case you insist
on fucking shutting them.

404
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,855
You see,

405
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:49,692
I know what it feels like
to be helpless.

406
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,279
just like when I watched you
slaughter my whole family.

407
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:59,621
You know you can't
fight fate, right, Darby?

408
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:02,875
Oh!

409
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:07,463
And look-
I made this especially for you.

410
00:27:10,134 --> 00:27:13,761
You like it? Yeah,
I didn't want you to miss anything.

411
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:19,434
Now you have the best
view in the house.

412
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:21,480
You hear that?

413
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:24,857
Your heart is beating so fast.

414
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:28,987
No, me too.

415
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:30,614
Okay.

416
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:36,702
Now they get to
watch you suffer.

417
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:42,086
They'll be the last thing
you ever see

418
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:45,548
as I cut off every single one
of your fucking limbs.

419
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:49,010
See, I wasn't lying

420
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:52,890
when I told you that I wanted
to keep you out of prison.

421
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,936
That was the truth.

422
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:36,313
Thanks for the car.

423
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:04,553
Sarah: Okay, these are all
the case files on Darby.

424
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,390
I vetted through what I could.
We have crime-scene photos-

425
00:29:07,556 --> 00:29:09,392
Don't need to see 'em.

426
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:12,103
Okay.

427
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:20,573
- What's bothering you?
- It's Darby.

428
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,576
All the crimes he's committed
have one thing in common,

429
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:25,912
and that was violence.
But yesterday at that execution,

430
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:28,079
- that wasn't violence. That was-
- What?

431
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:30,540
- That was intellect.
- Okay.

432
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,877
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know.

433
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:37,715
I'm just thinking maybe
we shouldn't be looking for Darby.

434
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,438
Jesus Christ.

435
00:30:02,994 --> 00:30:04,747
Rice.

436
00:30:04,913 --> 00:30:07,833
Detective:
Good news, Counselor. We found Darby.

437
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,086
I gotta say though,
he's looked better.

438
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:15,007
They found him in about 25 pieces:

439
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:18,635
no legs, no arms,
eyelids were sliced off- gruesome.

440
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:20,637
- Shedding tears for Darby?
- Not quite.

441
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:23,808
- I see your wheels tunning.
- Think motive- who has one?

442
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:26,644
The husband, the father.
What do we know about him?

443
00:30:26,811 --> 00:30:28,566
He owned the warehouse
where they found Darby.

444
00:30:28,732 --> 00:30:30,067
- What else?
- He's a tinkerer-

445
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:33,988
uh, little inventions, gizmos.
He holds two dozen patents

446
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:35,740
that made him some money.

447
00:30:35,906 --> 00:30:38,742
He liquidated most of
his wealth a few years ago

448
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,538
to buy some industrial
properties around airports,

449
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:44,583
chemical plants,
raiI yards.

450
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,252
- It doesn't add up.
- No, it's weird, right?

451
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,878
Search 'em all, Sarah.
See what you find.

452
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:08,050
Freeze!

453
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:11,306
- Get down, go!
- On your knees!

454
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:15,102
- Face down, face down!
- Pull him down and cuff him!

455
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:54,436
Crazy men scare
the shit out of me.

456
00:32:54,604 --> 00:32:56,730
Detective:
Is this guy a lawyer?

457
00:32:56,897 --> 00:32:58,357
No.

458
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:02,154
He's an engineer.

459
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:05,365
Nick, look at this.

460
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:45,493
We have zero evidence.
Gonna need a confessión.

461
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,413
He give you any trouble
on the way in?

462
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:48,789
No, nothing.

463
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:51,709
He wasn't too happy when
we took his bracelet, though.

464
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:03,181
- Can I help you?
- Package for the Rice family.

465
00:34:03,347 --> 00:34:06,268
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

466
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:11,648
Mom, the video from my recital came.
Can we watch it?

467
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:14,360
- Please?
- No, not you.

468
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:17,112
No, please, we said we were
gonna wait for your father, remember?

469
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,365
- Please?
- No, not now.

470
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:21,617
Okay.

471
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,163
Uh-huh, yes.

472
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,168
Yes, absolutely.

473
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:50,275
Mommy!

474
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,505
Don't worry, he's just disarming
the guy, letting him feeI easy.

475
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:13,885
What I'm about to tell you
I don't want anybody else to hear.

476
00:35:14,052 --> 00:35:16,804
As a prosecutor, I'm breaking
all the rules right now,

477
00:35:16,972 --> 00:35:19,684
and I don't give a damn
because I'm a father.

478
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,769
I have a little girl.

479
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:25,690
And what you did... bravo.

480
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:31,862
The worid is better
without Darby and Ames.

481
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,536
You're not gonna see a tear shed
from me or anybody in my office.

482
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:43,920
With that being said...

483
00:35:44,086 --> 00:35:46,297
I have a job to do.

484
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:50,927
I'm gonna ask you some very simple
and direct questions.

485
00:35:51,094 --> 00:35:54,972
I suggest that you
answer them in the same fashion.

486
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:57,141
Is your name Clyde Alexander Shelton?

487
00:35:58,143 --> 00:35:59,228
Yes, sir.

488
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:01,146
And you've waived
your right to counsel, correct?

489
00:36:01,313 --> 00:36:05,110
- Yes, sir.
- You sure you want to do that?

490
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:06,485
Yes.

491
00:36:06,652 --> 00:36:10,074
Did you murder Clarence Darby?

492
00:36:11,452 --> 00:36:14,038
I wanted him dead.

493
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:15,873
He killed my wife and child.

494
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:19,251
Rupert Ames-
did you murder him as well?

495
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,797
Rupert Ames deserved to die.

496
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:25,925
They both deserved to die.

497
00:36:26,092 --> 00:36:29,679
So you arranged
both of those murders?

498
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:32,181
Yes, I planned it...

499
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:36,186
in my head, over and over again.
It took me a long time.

500
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:41,190
All right.

501
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:43,528
I guess we're done here.

502
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:46,282
Counselor?

503
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:51,704
You might want to canceI
your 12:30 lunch with Judge Roberts.

504
00:36:52,706 --> 00:36:54,333
Excuse me?

505
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,835
In fact, you might want to
cancel the rest of the week,

506
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:59,713
'cause you're gonna be busy.
Sit down.

507
00:37:01,673 --> 00:37:04,092
We're done here.
We have your confessión.

508
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,594
Mmm. Oh, you do?

509
00:37:06,762 --> 00:37:08,347
On tape.

510
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:11,351
See, in our professión,
we consider that a slam-dunk.

511
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:14,271
Oh, really?
I don't think so. Let's think back.

512
00:37:14,438 --> 00:37:16,106
What did I say?

513
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:19,277
That I wanted to kill
Clarence Darby?

514
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,780
Yeah, sure.
What father wouldn't?

515
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:24,574
That both Darby and Ames
deserved to die?

516
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,369
I think most people
would agree with that.

517
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:29,789
That I planned it over and over
again in my head?

518
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,208
Yeah. Who wouldn't
fantasize about that?

519
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,088
None of these are
an admissión of guilt, Nick.

520
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,965
- You might want to check the tape.
- We know you did it.

521
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:42,469
Well, it's not what you know,
it's what you can prove in court.

522
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,096
Didn't you tell me that once?

523
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,597
The only problem with your theory

524
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,891
is that Darby's body was
found on your property.

525
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,230
One of my many properties-
an old abandoned warehouse, Nick.

526
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:54,317
Junkies, they trespass there
all the time.

527
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:56,568
Isn't Darby involved
in the drug trade?

528
00:37:56,737 --> 00:37:59,447
That's an unsavory worid.
I bet you a jury would agree.

529
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:02,659
Or perhaps someone was
trying to frame me.

530
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,536
You know, Clyde,

531
00:38:04,702 --> 00:38:07,789
there's a lot of assholes in prison
that thought they were smarter than me.

532
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:10,501
Let's stop fucking around.

533
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:13,628
Nick, unless you have any
hard evidence,

534
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:16,172
then why are we even here?
Why are we having this-

535
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,759
- What do you want?
- -conversation?

536
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:23,056
Well, that's easy.

537
00:38:23,222 --> 00:38:26,519
Now you're the one who
makes deals with murderers, yeah?

538
00:38:26,686 --> 00:38:28,898
So I've come to make mine.

539
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:33,568
I will give you a confessión,
a real confessión.

540
00:38:33,735 --> 00:38:35,905
You just have to
give me something in return.

541
00:38:36,072 --> 00:38:39,242
Yeah, well, since you
are a murderer, what might that be?

542
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:41,577
A bed.

543
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,541
But a nice bed.

544
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,128
I want a nice new one
for my cell.

545
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:50,795
Very simple.

546
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:53,507
You're gonna have to deal with that,
because the one I have is lumpy, Nick.

547
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:55,563
It's making me crazy.

548
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,471
Clyde, I think you've got me
confused with detail people.

549
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,724
See, I don't deaI
with prison conditions.

550
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:03,143
I believe those cots
are bolted into the cells.

551
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:06,398
Well, that's what wrenches are for,
dumbass.

552
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:09,818
You know, one of those new
Duxiana beds

553
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:13,322
with the adjustable- you know,
adjustable lumbar support,

554
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:14,824
- that's the one.
- I've seen the commercial.

555
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,409
- That's the one I want.
- Those are nice.

556
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:18,411
- 'Cause really-
- Comes on late at night.

557
00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:20,246
- And frankly I don't think-
- Two old people laying on the bed.

558
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:21,831
- I'll be able to focus
on anything

559
00:39:21,998 --> 00:39:24,166
untiI I've had a good
revitalizing night's sleep

560
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,585
in my therapeutic Duxiana bed.

561
00:39:26,753 --> 00:39:28,463
So that's the deal:

562
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,175
you get me my bed,
you get your confessión.

563
00:39:32,342 --> 00:39:35,181
Okay, let me think
about that for a second.

564
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:37,474
How about...

565
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,434
fuck no.

566
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,449
Hey, what are you doing?

567
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:53,742
- What do you mean?
- Why did you tell him no?

568
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:57,038
A mattress? He doesn't make
those kinds of decisions.

569
00:39:57,204 --> 00:40:00,373
Take your ego out of it, Nick. Shelton's
got a point: this case is shit.

570
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,876
We need a confessión.
And a mattress for a murder confessión?

571
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:05,253
- That's a pretty good deal.
- He's playing us, Jonas.

572
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,922
Well, then we will play him.

573
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,677
Nick?

574
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:11,387
There's an urgent call from your office.
They say you're not answering your cell.

575
00:40:11,554 --> 00:40:14,391
I need to finish up here and then
I will be home as soon as I can.

576
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,476
Listen to me:
the things on this video-

577
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:19,271
Nick, I have never seen
anything like it.

578
00:40:19,438 --> 00:40:20,773
Please come home.

579
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,777
Listen, you need to calm down.
Tell her that it's not real...

580
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:26,612
- Okay.
- ... and that I love her.

581
00:40:26,778 --> 00:40:27,822
Come home.
Come home soon, please.

582
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:29,824
- Kelly, did you see his face?
- No.

583
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,076
It was covered with something.
I couldn't see.

584
00:40:32,242 --> 00:40:35,246
Okay, baby, let me finish up here and
I'll come home as fast as I can, okay?

585
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:37,291
Okay.

586
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:40,543
This motherfucker sent a DVD to my house
of him killing Darby.

587
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,507
- What?
- My daughter saw it.

588
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,844
He recorded it?
We've got him.

589
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,472
No no, he had on a mask.
We need that confessión.

590
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,766
You still want to bargain
with this man?

591
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:55,144
The art of the possible, Warden.

592
00:40:55,311 --> 00:40:56,813
Make the deal.

593
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:02,445
Hey, come on, man! Give us one!

594
00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:18,380
Back problems, Warden-
the worst.

595
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:20,965
You got bigger problems than that.

596
00:41:21,132 --> 00:41:23,719
It's the have-nots in here, son.

597
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:27,556
I don't know that I want
to be the one "have. "

598
00:41:30,476 --> 00:41:32,811
Turn around.

599
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,485
I don't think he likes me.

600
00:41:41,028 --> 00:41:42,864
Nice bed.

601
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:46,702
Thank you.

602
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:49,371
It's a single.

603
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,086
I'd watch my fucking back
around here, you hear?

604
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:56,882
In the cell, let's go.

605
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:02,596
We can't put
Clyde Shelton anywhere-

606
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:04,847
not in a job, not in a city,
not even the country.

607
00:42:05,014 --> 00:42:08,061
So I dug a little deeper and I found
something from his missing years:

608
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:11,731
a couple of contract payments to Clyde
from the Department of Defense.

609
00:42:11,898 --> 00:42:14,567
- And his real estate?
- He bought nine properties

610
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,652
under his own name,
then he transferred them

611
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,987
to some corporation in Panama.

612
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:20,030
We can't get to the addresses.

613
00:42:20,197 --> 00:42:21,615
A lack of reciprocity
is our problem.

614
00:42:21,782 --> 00:42:23,367
So I'm gonna circle
back to the farmhouse.

615
00:42:23,534 --> 00:42:26,748
That's a waste of time. He wanted us
to find it and find him there.

616
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:29,126
It's the industrial stuff
that's curious.

617
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:31,795
All right, I don't care what you
have to do and who you have to piss off.

618
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:34,465
If we have to invade
Panama again, fine.

619
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:37,135
Clyde is hiding those properties
for a reason. Find him.

620
00:42:37,302 --> 00:42:38,552
Got it.

621
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:53,360
- Baby, you leave it cracked?
- Hmm? Yeah, I left it cracked.

622
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:56,239
- Night light?
- Isn't she too old for a night light?

623
00:42:56,405 --> 00:42:58,659
Yeah, I left a night light.

624
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,704
- Good.
- Look,

625
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:02,706
I told her that
that video wasn't real.

626
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:05,125
- Okay.
- It's some sort of horror film-

627
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,793
something she shouldn't
be looking at anyway.

628
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,670
- Okay, good.
- She'll be okay.

629
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,338
Yeah. And you?

630
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,425
- Am I what? Okay?
- Yeah.

631
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:15,637
Of course.
Don't I look okay?

632
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:17,681
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

633
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:22,226
Nick is always okay.

634
00:43:22,393 --> 00:43:25,021
Always- I'm extra good.

635
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,650
I love you.

636
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:30,235
I love you too.

637
00:43:36,076 --> 00:43:38,579
In light of Mr. Shelton's
economic means

638
00:43:38,746 --> 00:43:40,456
and his potential flight risk,

639
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:44,043
the egregious nature of both
Mr. Ames's and Mr. Darby's deaths,

640
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:48,047
the state requests that
bail be denied, Your Honor.

641
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:51,385
Seeing as how you've...

642
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,554
waived your right to
counsel, Mr. Shelton,

643
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:56,974
do you have anything to say?

644
00:43:57,141 --> 00:43:59,143
Mr. Shelton?

645
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:03,648
Do you have anything
that you'd like to say, Mr. Shelton?

646
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:06,150
Yes yes yes, Your Honor.

647
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:09,197
- Should I stand?
- Please.

648
00:44:17,456 --> 00:44:20,333
Your Honor, I'm a law-abiding citizen.

649
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:22,378
I'm just a regular guy.

650
00:44:22,545 --> 00:44:25,340
I am not a flight risk.

651
00:44:25,507 --> 00:44:28,092
And this is my first alleged offense.

652
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,889
And the prosecution has not presented
one single piece of evidence against me.

653
00:44:34,391 --> 00:44:36,434
Now in these circumstances,

654
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:39,103
unless the state has obtained
some new piece of information

655
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:42,025
relating to my involvement
in the matter in question,

656
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:46,112
then I find it highly prejudiciaI,
even constitutionally offensive,

657
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,574
to keep me detained without bail.

658
00:44:48,742 --> 00:44:50,827
It's a slippery slope,
Your Honor.

659
00:44:50,994 --> 00:44:54,123
Haven't we seen the result
of such violations,

660
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:56,708
both internationally and domestically?
Case in point

661
00:44:56,875 --> 00:45:01,170
would be Day v. McDonough,
docket #041325.

662
00:45:03,215 --> 00:45:07,927
I am actually inclined
to agree with you, Mr. Shelton.

663
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:12,266
Your Honor, Mr. Shelton has
agreed to give us a full confessión.

664
00:45:13,684 --> 00:45:15,396
Has he given it, Mr. Rice?

665
00:45:15,563 --> 00:45:17,023
No, Your Honor.

666
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,860
Well, then in my opinion,

667
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:22,780
the state has failed to establish
a compelling basis

668
00:45:22,947 --> 00:45:26,117
for its motion,
and I will grant bail in the amount of-

669
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:28,452
Your Honor,
I would caution you not to do that.

670
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:31,288
Thank you.

671
00:45:31,454 --> 00:45:33,000
Excuse me?

672
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,793
No, I don't think I will excuse you.

673
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,838
You see, this is what
I'm talking about.

674
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:40,923
You were about to let me go.
Are you kidding me?

675
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:44,510
This is why we're here
in the first place.

676
00:45:45,596 --> 00:45:48,431
You think I don't remember
who you are, lady?

677
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,436
I would tread carefully, Mr. Shelton.

678
00:45:51,603 --> 00:45:53,313
Well, how carefully
should I tread?

679
00:45:53,481 --> 00:45:56,193
Because apparently
I just killed two people,

680
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,822
and you were about to let me
walk right out that door!

681
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:02,365
How misguided are you?

682
00:46:02,532 --> 00:46:05,869
I feed you a couple of
bullshit legal precedents,

683
00:46:06,036 --> 00:46:09,123
and there you go- you jump
on it like a bitch in heat.

684
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:11,751
- Folks, you all hang out-
- I'm warning you, Mr. Shelton!

685
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,835
- -in the same little club.
- You will be held in contempt!

686
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:16,213
And every day you let madmen
and murderers back on the street.

687
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,800
- You're too busy treating the law-
- One more time!

688
00:46:18,967 --> 00:46:20,344
- -like it's a fucking assembly line!
- One more time.

689
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,221
- Do you have any idea what justice is?
- You are now-

690
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:24,307
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- -in contempt of court.

691
00:46:24,474 --> 00:46:27,561
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- Remove this man.

692
00:46:27,728 --> 00:46:30,188
- Whatever happened to the people?
- Bail denied!

693
00:46:30,356 --> 00:46:32,315
- Whatever happened to justice?
- Bail denied!

694
00:46:32,483 --> 00:46:35,695
And I bet you take it up
the fucking ass, bitch.

695
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:37,028
Bailiff.

696
00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:38,989
Hey, see you later, Nick.

697
00:46:40,242 --> 00:46:42,452
Insanity?

698
00:46:43,536 --> 00:46:46,373
That's what you're building
your defense on? Insanity?

699
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:51,211
Nick, I told you I would
give you a confessión.

700
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:53,088
And I- I meant it.

701
00:46:53,255 --> 00:46:55,340
- I saw a movie today.
- You did?

702
00:46:55,507 --> 00:46:58,346
My daughter saw the same movie.

703
00:46:58,512 --> 00:47:01,391
Well, you taught your daughter
about good versus eviI?

704
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:03,226
I don't have to.

705
00:47:03,393 --> 00:47:06,856
Well, that's what this movie was about:
good conquering evil,

706
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:09,358
the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

707
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:11,443
I didn't get that.

708
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:14,614
I'm gonna give you
one more chance, Clyde.

709
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,284
And don't test me
'cause I will run you over.

710
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:20,369
Fair enough.

711
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:23,079
You did get me my bed.

712
00:47:23,246 --> 00:47:25,541
A deal's a deal.

713
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,420
That was you on video
killing Clarence Darby, wasn't it?

714
00:47:28,586 --> 00:47:30,338
Yes, that was me.

715
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:36,139
Okay, fair enough.
That was me, Clyde Shelton,

716
00:47:36,304 --> 00:47:38,181
on the video,
killing Clarence Darby.

717
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:40,434
Not good enough, Clyde.
I need specifics.

718
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:46,440
I took his fingers with bolt cutters,

719
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:47,817
his toes with tin snips,

720
00:47:47,983 --> 00:47:50,320
his balls with a hacksaw,

721
00:47:50,487 --> 00:47:53,782
and his penis with a box cutter.

722
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:55,659
How's that for specifics?

723
00:47:56,744 --> 00:47:58,119
And Ames?

724
00:47:58,286 --> 00:48:01,916
Switching the canisters was easy.
Everything's automated these days,

725
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:04,335
so I just hacked into
the shipping company's server

726
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:07,423
and swapped a few numbers around
so the package came to me.

727
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,800
Then I switched
the potassium chloride

728
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:14,264
with something a little more...
deliberate.

729
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:17,643
Well, I'm tired of
hearing your bullshit.

730
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:19,728
I got everything I need.

731
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,063
What now?

732
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:23,983
I go home;
you go to prison.

733
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,568
You know, the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

734
00:48:26,735 --> 00:48:28,987
That ought to make you
feel better about the system.

735
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:30,447
What if I had another
confessión to make?

736
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:32,324
Call a priest.

737
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,369
But another confessión would
mean another deal, Nick,

738
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:37,581
so you would have to
give me something in return.

739
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:44,798
You ever been to Del Frisco's?
They cater.

740
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:48,802
So for lunch, I would love
a 20oz porterhouse steak,

741
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:51,431
medium,
maybe a little bit charred,

742
00:48:51,597 --> 00:48:55,893
with all the trimmings-
pommes frites, asparagus, butter squash.

743
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:58,606
Fuck you and your pommes frites.

744
00:49:00,273 --> 00:49:02,777
I'll tell you what:
can I have my iPod as well?

745
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,780
I'd love a little bit
of music with my meal.

746
00:49:05,947 --> 00:49:08,824
First rule of negotiating, Clyde: you
gotta have something to bargain with.

747
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,494
Would the life of
Bill Reynolds suffice?

748
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:21,007
Open it.

749
00:49:23,509 --> 00:49:25,510
Who the fuck is Bill Reynolds?

750
00:49:25,677 --> 00:49:27,347
Darby's attorney.

751
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:29,932
Tell me you located him.

752
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:33,686
I've got his wife.
She reported him missing three days ago.

753
00:49:33,853 --> 00:49:35,050
Thank you, Mrs. Reynolds.

754
00:49:36,242 --> 00:49:38,942
Well, looks like I got something
to bargain with after all, Nick.

755
00:49:40,485 --> 00:49:43,114
At the moment,
Bill Reynolds is still alive.

756
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,157
I'll tell you exactly where he is.

757
00:49:46,324 --> 00:49:50,164
Just bring me my meal and
my music at 1:00 exactly.

758
00:49:50,331 --> 00:49:52,751
00 sharp.

759
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:55,045
00, Nick.

760
00:50:08,893 --> 00:50:10,936
That's good, right there.

761
00:50:14,856 --> 00:50:16,650
All right, up!

762
00:50:22,951 --> 00:50:26,538
- It's 5 to 1:00.
- I don't take orders from him or you.

763
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:28,583
And inmates don't have
access to the time.

764
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:31,668
- We tell them what time it is.
- I don't care if he has a Rolex or not.

765
00:50:31,835 --> 00:50:33,880
We need to stick to the timeline
that was agreed to.

766
00:50:34,047 --> 00:50:36,173
Fuck him, Nick.
Let him wait.

767
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,050
Christ, he sawed a guy's dick off.

768
00:50:38,217 --> 00:50:40,387
Whether you like it or not,
we are on his time.

769
00:50:40,552 --> 00:50:42,429
Check it again.

770
00:50:46,268 --> 00:50:48,811
Are you shitting me with this?!

771
00:50:51,606 --> 00:50:53,108
This motherfucker!

772
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,327
Man, come on!
I'm fucking hungry!

773
00:51:06,123 --> 00:51:08,335
Steamed asparagus,

774
00:51:08,501 --> 00:51:11,338
- lobster macaroni and cheese...
- Wow.

775
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,052
...porterhouse steak,
seared, medium rare.

776
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:19,179
Mmm!

777
00:51:23,643 --> 00:51:25,311
Hmm.

778
00:51:25,478 --> 00:51:27,563
- Napkin, Nick.
- Napkin.

779
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:32,862
Oh, excuse me, waiter?

780
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,076
You might want to put 30%
down for yourself, my man.

781
00:51:39,161 --> 00:51:42,039
- Hey, what time is it?
- It's 1:00.

782
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,876
Is that right, Nick?

783
00:51:45,043 --> 00:51:48,755
- It's 1:08.
- That's disappointing, Warden.

784
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:51,132
I mean, how can you expect me
not to fuck with you

785
00:51:51,298 --> 00:51:52,842
when you can't even
be honest with me?

786
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:56,887
Late or not, Clyde, you have what you
asked for. Now where's Reynolds?

787
00:51:57,054 --> 00:51:58,974
Can I have some silverware,
gentlemen?

788
00:51:59,141 --> 00:52:00,559
Silverware.

789
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:03,021
You get a spork.

790
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:06,068
Idiot.

791
00:52:08,402 --> 00:52:10,072
Thanks.

792
00:52:18,996 --> 00:52:20,958
Come on, Clyde.

793
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,132
Okay.

794
00:52:27,298 --> 00:52:30,050
Here we go:

795
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:33,346
39N57'...

796
00:52:33,512 --> 00:52:35,097
04",

797
00:52:35,264 --> 00:52:38,938
075W10'22".

798
00:52:39,103 --> 00:52:40,731
And you'd better hurry, Nick.

799
00:52:40,898 --> 00:52:43,442
'Cause by anybody's watch but
the warden's, you're already late.

800
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:46,320
- Open the door!
- Inmate: Where's my lunch?

801
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,289
I'll take a ground unit!

802
00:53:17,146 --> 00:53:20,067
So I suppose if I don't
share this with you, you're gonna-

803
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:21,693
I'm gonna get the fuck up,

804
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,862
I'm gonna cock back
my right hand,

805
00:53:24,028 --> 00:53:27,615
and I'm gonna split your whole
fucking skull in two. How about that?

806
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:32,456
Well, come on over here. Join me.
There's plenty to go around.

807
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:40,422
Here, enjoy.
Have some pasta.

808
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:42,715
It's good.

809
00:53:42,882 --> 00:53:44,510
What about some steak?
You want steak?

810
00:53:44,675 --> 00:53:46,177
- Mmm.
- Here, have some steak.

811
00:53:46,344 --> 00:53:48,474
Here's a big piece for you.

812
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:50,768
There you go.

813
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,940
Good, huh?

814
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:08,036
What'd you do
to get in here, anyways?

815
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,541
I did what I had to do.

816
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,965
So you got a girl or something?

817
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:25,349
Mmm, it's a long story.

818
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:31,230
Pilot, how much longer?

819
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:34,483
Two minutes.

820
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,739
How about you?
You have a girl?

821
00:54:39,907 --> 00:54:42,409
- Got a few giris back home.
- Oh, yeah?

822
00:54:42,576 --> 00:54:44,244
Yeah.

823
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:47,414
- You have a boyfriend in here or no?
- Get the fuck out of here.

824
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:03,474
This is- it's Reynolds's.

825
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,978
- Not a good sign, Nick.
- Just dig.

826
00:55:20,992 --> 00:55:22,827
- Jesus Christ!
- Reynolds!

827
00:55:22,994 --> 00:55:26,041
- He's unconscious.
- Reynolds!

828
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:29,213
He's gone, Nick.
He's gone.

829
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,423
- Oxygen?
- Get something to get him out!

830
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,094
Detective: He's got IV lines
going to his-

831
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,387
He's got him cuffed!

832
00:55:37,554 --> 00:55:41,016
Nick: Listen, you got your keys
to the cuffs?

833
00:55:42,726 --> 00:55:44,978
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

834
00:55:45,146 --> 00:55:46,856
Shit.

835
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:49,693
Oh, God, I'm so happy.

836
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,362
Your lucky day, huh?
Get some food.

837
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,407
Here, wanna take a shot at this?

838
00:55:55,574 --> 00:55:57,701
- What is it?
- Know how to use it?

839
00:55:57,867 --> 00:56:00,121
No.

840
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:19,768
Oh, shit! Check this out!

841
00:56:22,855 --> 00:56:25,106
He's crazy!

842
00:56:25,273 --> 00:56:26,775
Don't stop now, partner!

843
00:56:26,943 --> 00:56:29,778
Finish him, come on!
Take his head off!

844
00:56:29,945 --> 00:56:34,201
Take it off!

845
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:06,403
I need a shower, Warden.

846
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:07,780
Get him out of there!

847
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,788
Nick: Dunnigan,
what time do you have?

848
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:17,335
37.

849
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:19,295
Took us roughly 15 minutes
to get here.

850
00:57:19,461 --> 00:57:20,545
Yeah?

851
00:57:20,713 --> 00:57:23,215
Reynolds's air was rigged to
shut off at 1:15.

852
00:57:23,382 --> 00:57:26,135
If Shelton would have got
his lunch on time, he'd still be alive.

853
00:57:26,302 --> 00:57:27,594
Fuck this guy, Nick.

854
00:57:27,762 --> 00:57:31,516
He wants to play games,
we can play games too.

855
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:34,018
We need to take the gloves off.

856
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,894
No.

857
00:57:40,025 --> 00:57:43,070
Nick, it's Sarah.
Listen, Clyde murdered his cell-mate.

858
00:57:43,237 --> 00:57:47,117
The warden is furious.
He's moving him to solitary.

859
00:57:47,284 --> 00:57:49,536
That's all I know right now.

860
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:23,240
How are we doing?

861
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:26,329
Great. Can you believe this?

862
00:58:26,496 --> 00:58:29,623
Checking his iPod for clues.

863
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:31,333
I do the same thing
with my daughter's.

864
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:33,210
Learn anything?

865
00:58:33,378 --> 00:58:35,797
Yeah, they both got
shit taste in music.

866
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,217
We got a game plan
with this guy or what?

867
00:58:40,385 --> 00:58:41,969
Game plan?

868
00:58:42,137 --> 00:58:44,014
I tell you, I got a game plan.

869
00:58:44,179 --> 00:58:46,891
Give me five minutes alone with him
and I'll cripple the fucker.

870
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:50,061
I don't give a shit
what happened to his family.

871
00:58:50,228 --> 00:58:51,688
It's no excuse.

872
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:00,367
Wow.

873
00:59:07,498 --> 00:59:09,166
Stop right there.

874
00:59:17,844 --> 00:59:19,554
Step into the cell.

875
01:00:05,773 --> 01:00:08,235
We found Reynolds.

876
01:00:08,402 --> 01:00:11,362
Moments too late,
from what I hear.

877
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:15,284
I had to call his wife and tell her
that her husband had been buried alive.

878
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:18,286
Justice should be harsh, Nick,

879
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:20,956
but especially for those
who denied it to others.

880
01:00:21,123 --> 01:00:23,710
And your cell-mate?
What was that about?

881
01:00:27,463 --> 01:00:30,257
You murdered a man
because your lunch was late.

882
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:32,260
No.

883
01:00:32,427 --> 01:00:36,682
No. No, you murdered him
because you couldn't keep your word.

884
01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:39,936
We made a deal, you and I:
00 PM.

885
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,983
That's a pretty important principle
I'd like you start learning, Nick:

886
01:00:43,148 --> 01:00:45,068
- keeping your word.
- Oh, really?

887
01:00:45,235 --> 01:00:48,155
What principle was at work when
you tortured and killed those people?

888
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,199
That everyone must be held
accountable for their actions.

889
01:00:58,331 --> 01:01:01,083
You think your wife
and daughter would feel good

890
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:04,086
about you killing in their name?

891
01:01:29,826 --> 01:01:33,371
My wife and daughter
can't feeI anything.

892
01:01:34,748 --> 01:01:36,750
They're dead.

893
01:02:12,706 --> 01:02:14,668
Hey, Nick?

894
01:02:14,835 --> 01:02:17,170
On Clyde's real estate,
Judge Stansfield shut us down.

895
01:02:17,336 --> 01:02:20,800
He's looking for some sort of legal
precedent that I'm not sure exists.

896
01:02:20,967 --> 01:02:22,010
- But?
- But...

897
01:02:22,177 --> 01:02:23,469
I think I may have found
a way around it.

898
01:02:23,637 --> 01:02:25,806
- I'll call in a favor from a friend.
- Who's your friend?

899
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:28,141
You don't name your friends
or they stop doing you favors.

900
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:29,976
Something else Cantrell said.

901
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:34,148
No, that was all you.
Jonas, hi.

902
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:38,277
She's thinking just like you, Nick.
Guess you trained her well.

903
01:02:38,445 --> 01:02:41,447
- One day she'll have my job.
- Let's get some air.

904
01:02:44,492 --> 01:02:46,829
Clyde's government contract payments
were bothering me,

905
01:02:46,994 --> 01:02:49,581
so I pulled some ancient strings.
We're meeting someone.

906
01:02:49,748 --> 01:02:51,208
Who might that be?

907
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:55,213
Someone who does some really nasty shit
so we can live the American dream.

908
01:03:07,393 --> 01:03:09,355
So Clyde finally lost it?

909
01:03:09,521 --> 01:03:11,648
Somebody must have
really pissed him off.

910
01:03:11,815 --> 01:03:14,150
You worked with Shelton,
is that right?

911
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:18,030
Okay, first of all,
I was never here and we never spoke.

912
01:03:18,197 --> 01:03:20,824
Tell us what we're dealing with.
Shelton was a spy or-

913
01:03:20,992 --> 01:03:23,577
Spies are a dime a dozen.
I'm a spy.

914
01:03:23,744 --> 01:03:27,251
Clyde is a brain.
He's a think-tank type guy.

915
01:03:27,418 --> 01:03:29,920
His specialty was low-impact
kinetic operations.

916
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:32,465
Is this a hell of a fancy way
to say that he kills people?

917
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:33,757
We kill people.

918
01:03:33,923 --> 01:03:36,427
He figured out how to do it
without ever being in the same room.

919
01:03:36,594 --> 01:03:39,931
It was his gift,
and he was the best.

920
01:03:40,097 --> 01:03:42,516
One time we're tasking
this tricky target.

921
01:03:42,682 --> 01:03:45,186
I mean, we're using cruise missiles
and predators

922
01:03:45,353 --> 01:03:49,148
and we even had a B-2 bomber
flatten this guy's villa with a JDAM.

923
01:03:49,315 --> 01:03:50,943
All right? We're burning up
millions in ordnance

924
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,443
and we're getting nowhere
with this guy.

925
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:55,530
So we call Clyde and
we ask him to solve our problem.

926
01:03:55,697 --> 01:03:57,615
Clyde develops a Kevlar thread

927
01:03:57,782 --> 01:04:00,452
with a high-tech ratchet
made of carbon fiber

928
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:02,498
put in a necktie.

929
01:04:02,664 --> 01:04:05,251
Two days later, Mrs. Bad Guy
comes home,

930
01:04:05,418 --> 01:04:08,130
finds Mr. Bad Guy dead
on the bathroom tile,

931
01:04:08,297 --> 01:04:09,632
choked to death.

932
01:04:11,425 --> 01:04:14,302
What I'm saying is, just assume
that this guy can hear and see

933
01:04:14,469 --> 01:04:16,137
everything that you're doing.

934
01:04:16,304 --> 01:04:18,431
Nick: No, we've got him locked away,
maximum security.

935
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:21,601
Man: If he's in jail, it's because
he wants to be in jail.

936
01:04:21,768 --> 01:04:25,438
He's a born tactician. Every move
that he makes, it means something.

937
01:04:26,481 --> 01:04:28,943
That cell-mate that he killed-
you think that was random?

938
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,280
No.

939
01:04:32,447 --> 01:04:35,077
That's a pawn being
moved off the board.

940
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:39,498
If I were you,
I'd be looking for the next piece.

941
01:04:39,664 --> 01:04:42,335
Anybody who had anything
to do with that case,

942
01:04:42,501 --> 01:04:44,503
he's gonna be coming after you.

943
01:04:45,505 --> 01:04:49,717
So what are you saying?
You saying we can't stop him?

944
01:04:51,802 --> 01:04:54,639
Walk into his cell
and put a bullet in his head.

945
01:04:56,516 --> 01:04:59,478
Aside from that?
No, you can't stop him.

946
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:02,106
If Clyde wants you dead,
you're dead.

947
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:16,581
- Hello?
- Sarah? Sarah, it's Nick.

948
01:05:16,748 --> 01:05:18,501
Set up a meeting
with Judge Burch.

949
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:20,670
We need her to help us
keep Clyde on ice.

950
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:23,463
Help us with what, Nick?
The man's in prison.

951
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:25,340
He's worse than we thought.

952
01:05:25,507 --> 01:05:27,969
- Chester's your boyfriend, right?
- Chester.

953
01:05:28,135 --> 01:05:29,971
Yeah.

954
01:05:30,137 --> 01:05:33,349
Good. Maybe stay a few days
at his place.

955
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:36,561
And have Dunnigan send
a patroI car to my house.

956
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:38,480
Sorry about this, Sarah.

957
01:05:45,697 --> 01:05:47,951
Judge Burch:
I can't supersede the penal code.

958
01:05:48,117 --> 01:05:49,577
You've already got him in solitary.

959
01:05:49,744 --> 01:05:51,996
A half-decent paralegal will have him
out of there by next week.

960
01:05:52,163 --> 01:05:53,831
We just want to limit his options;

961
01:05:53,998 --> 01:05:55,666
give him less contact,
less access,

962
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:59,128
even if it's just rescinding his
mandatory exercise period for a week.

963
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,423
- Under what cause?
- Whatever cause you want.

964
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,800
Wrap it around whatever
piece of legal doctrine

965
01:06:03,967 --> 01:06:07,554
that helps you rationalize it,
Your Honor.

966
01:06:09,347 --> 01:06:10,557
So let me get this straight:

967
01:06:10,724 --> 01:06:13,393
you want me to violate
his God-given civil rights

968
01:06:13,561 --> 01:06:16,396
in the name of some murky sense
of the greater good.

969
01:06:16,563 --> 01:06:18,693
Is that the gist of it, gentlemen?

970
01:06:25,451 --> 01:06:27,911
Okay. I'm game.

971
01:06:28,913 --> 01:06:33,083
Just don't plan
on it sticking for long, all right?

972
01:06:36,588 --> 01:06:38,297
Wait, you're gonna take that,

973
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,550
after all the grief you've
given me over cell phones?

974
01:06:40,717 --> 01:06:43,635
That's one of the benefits of
being a judge, Mr. Rice.

975
01:06:43,802 --> 01:06:46,849
I can pretty much do
whatever I want.

976
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:50,644
Hello?

977
01:06:53,315 --> 01:06:54,943
Oh my God.

978
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,695
Back out. Back out.

979
01:07:00,572 --> 01:07:04,536
at city hall, though
we are unable to confirm the details,

980
01:07:04,702 --> 01:07:06,829
we do know that
at least one person is dead

981
01:07:06,996 --> 01:07:09,125
in what officials are calling
a possible murder.

982
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,543
We have reporters
on the ground...

983
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:12,961
Up.

984
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,885
Somebody's helping this guy-

985
01:07:20,052 --> 01:07:22,304
a bomb in that phone,
and she doesn't know about it.

986
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:25,432
Who had access?

987
01:07:25,601 --> 01:07:27,311
Are you okay?

988
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:30,148
I've survived the war
and two ex-wives. I'll be fine.

989
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:33,987
How are you holding up?

990
01:07:34,152 --> 01:07:36,447
I'm good.

991
01:07:52,213 --> 01:07:54,007
So you're killing judges now?

992
01:07:54,175 --> 01:07:58,304
In my experience, Nick, lessons not
learned in blood are soon forgotten.

993
01:07:58,471 --> 01:08:01,101
And vengeance keeps you
warm at night.

994
01:08:01,268 --> 01:08:03,269
Vengeance?

995
01:08:05,063 --> 01:08:07,983
That's what you think this is about?
Vengeance?

996
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,818
What else could it be?

997
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:14,239
No, Nick, I had 10 years
for vengeance, if that's what I wanted.

998
01:08:14,405 --> 01:08:18,036
You don't think that I watch you
go to work every morning at 8:00 AM?

999
01:08:18,202 --> 01:08:22,122
Or that I watch Kelly take Denise
to schooI, 8:15?

1000
01:08:22,289 --> 01:08:26,043
No, I could have slaughtered you
or your family anytime I wanted!

1001
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:28,921
You even think about
touching my family-

1002
01:08:29,088 --> 01:08:32,634
you even think about touching
my family...

1003
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:43,273
I do my job.

1004
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,817
I'm the best at it.

1005
01:08:45,984 --> 01:08:48,235
- It works.
- You were doing yourjob

1006
01:08:48,403 --> 01:08:52,698
the way that best served you, Nick-
the way that best served you.

1007
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:56,118
- That has to change.
- What do you want, Clyde?

1008
01:08:56,286 --> 01:08:58,829
You at war with the whole worid?
It's not gonna bring anybody back.

1009
01:08:58,997 --> 01:09:02,292
No, I'm at war with this-

1010
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:05,505
this- this broken thing-

1011
01:09:05,671 --> 01:09:07,715
this thing that brought
you and I together.

1012
01:09:07,881 --> 01:09:10,302
This broken thing works
for people that are sane.

1013
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:12,847
You think doing what you're doing
is gonna change anything?

1014
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:15,516
You and whoever else
you have helping you

1015
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,685
are gonna pay.

1016
01:09:19,354 --> 01:09:21,481
I don't think you
have any idea

1017
01:09:21,648 --> 01:09:24,193
who's helping me
or what I'm doing.

1018
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:25,487
It's a matter of time.

1019
01:09:25,653 --> 01:09:27,905
See, you see the bodies,
you see the smoke,

1020
01:09:28,073 --> 01:09:31,117
but the larger picture
still eludes you.

1021
01:09:31,283 --> 01:09:33,369
Do tell.

1022
01:09:34,412 --> 01:09:37,582
I would like to...

1023
01:09:37,748 --> 01:09:39,583
but I would rather show you.

1024
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:45,676
I still have faith in you,
so I'm gonna give you one last chance.

1025
01:09:45,842 --> 01:09:47,176
Here's the deal:

1026
01:09:47,344 --> 01:09:51,766
release me and drop
all charges by 6:00 AM.

1027
01:09:51,932 --> 01:09:54,685
- 6:00 AM, Nick.
- Or what?

1028
01:09:57,396 --> 01:10:00,233
Or I kill everyone.

1029
01:10:11,578 --> 01:10:13,331
- Hello?
- Nick: Yeah, Sarah,

1030
01:10:13,497 --> 01:10:16,502
he has to have an accomplice-
probably somebody inside the prison.

1031
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:20,006
We have to go through all the prisoners'
files to find some sort of connection.

1032
01:10:20,173 --> 01:10:21,884
Do you want the files
brought to the office?

1033
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:25,261
No, there isn't time. Get everybody
together and bring them to the prison.

1034
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:26,889
We're moving in.

1035
01:10:45,117 --> 01:10:47,243
Stop looking at your watch.

1036
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,125
Anything from your friend?

1037
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:52,917
This treaty with Panama is a mess.

1038
01:10:53,085 --> 01:10:56,047
We can't access anything about
specific property holdings,

1039
01:10:56,213 --> 01:10:58,091
but my friend found
this tiny loophole

1040
01:10:58,257 --> 01:11:01,470
that grants us access to
Clyde's corporate expenses.

1041
01:11:01,636 --> 01:11:03,137
Does that help?

1042
01:11:07,475 --> 01:11:11,396
So we match sale prices
of industrial properties sold in Philly

1043
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:14,274
up against purchases made
by his corporation.

1044
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,778
Okay, I got it.

1045
01:11:26,497 --> 01:11:29,542
- Hey, Nick, can I ask you something?
- Hmm?

1046
01:11:32,462 --> 01:11:34,672
Would you do it
the same way now?

1047
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,342
Would you still cut
a deal for Darby?

1048
01:11:39,177 --> 01:11:43,057
This is the job, Sarah.
We have to make choices.

1049
01:11:43,225 --> 01:11:47,061
- But did you make the right choice?
- We made the right choice, right?

1050
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,899
I don't know.

1051
01:11:52,067 --> 01:11:54,485
I'm 35, Nick.

1052
01:11:54,653 --> 01:11:56,613
And there are things-
there are possibilities

1053
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:58,533
that I'm not gonna have now.

1054
01:11:59,702 --> 01:12:03,622
And it's okay.
I know it's part of the deal.

1055
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:08,628
And don't get me wrong.
I love working for you.

1056
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:15,636
But I just want to make sure
I gave up those things

1057
01:12:15,802 --> 01:12:19,222
for more than just
a high conviction rate.

1058
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:40,914
Do you want any more coffee?

1059
01:12:41,082 --> 01:12:42,332
No.

1060
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:40,521
All right.

1061
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:43,027
All right, let's just get focused here.
This guy's not God.

1062
01:13:43,194 --> 01:13:45,613
He's not the All Powerful.
He's just well-prepared.

1063
01:13:45,779 --> 01:13:47,782
We need to be equally
well-prepared.

1064
01:13:47,948 --> 01:13:51,661
Take a couple of hours, go home,
come back. We'll get a fresh start.

1065
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:53,203
Okay?

1066
01:14:03,215 --> 01:14:07,052
Man: Come on, old man, let's see if
we can find you some breakfast.

1067
01:14:21,904 --> 01:14:24,155
Hey, Nick, get some rest.

1068
01:14:24,323 --> 01:14:28,661
Give Chester my regards.
When do I get to meet him?

1069
01:14:28,828 --> 01:14:32,081
Oh, he's not ready for that.

1070
01:14:33,332 --> 01:14:34,876
'Night, Jonas.

1071
01:14:46,221 --> 01:14:48,474
I don't know how
this one's gonna turn out, Nick.

1072
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,645
We're gonna stop him.
That's how it's gonna turn out.

1073
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:53,448
Ahh!

1074
01:15:02,907 --> 01:15:05,618
Sarah.

1075
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,710
Sarah.

1076
01:15:46,122 --> 01:15:49,667
Reporter: In the past 48 hours, six
officials from the Justice Department

1077
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:53,130
have been killed in a series of vicious
and premeditated attacks.

1078
01:15:53,296 --> 01:15:55,966
This marks the first time in
the history of the United States

1079
01:15:56,132 --> 01:15:59,012
where government officials have been,
by all appearances,

1080
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,140
systematically murdered.

1081
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:04,144
We'll continue to follow this story and
bring you up-to-the-minute details...

1082
01:16:08,148 --> 01:16:11,150
Nick, I'm sorry to have to do this now,
but we've got something here.

1083
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:14,029
Found this right outside the wall-

1084
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,989
radio beacon-

1085
01:16:16,157 --> 01:16:18,868
sent an arming signal to the car bombs
when they went through the gate.

1086
01:16:19,034 --> 01:16:21,621
Dunnigan: Security said they checked
every car before anybody got in them.

1087
01:16:21,787 --> 01:16:25,082
They didn't check the gas tanks.
That's where the clever prick put 'em.

1088
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,960
Real precise stuff too.

1089
01:16:27,126 --> 01:16:29,045
Could have taken out
a lot more if he wanted to.

1090
01:16:29,212 --> 01:16:32,009
- Cantrell: What about Nick's car?
- That's the weird thing.

1091
01:16:32,175 --> 01:16:34,761
It's clean-
hadn't been touched.

1092
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:38,015
I gotta go.

1093
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:47,609
Jesus Christ.

1094
01:16:56,117 --> 01:16:58,286
Privacy, please.

1095
01:17:00,081 --> 01:17:03,126
So let me get this straight:

1096
01:17:03,292 --> 01:17:06,213
not only do we
know who did it,

1097
01:17:06,381 --> 01:17:10,469
we have him locked up
and he's still killing people?

1098
01:17:11,845 --> 01:17:16,015
You boys sure
fucked this one up.

1099
01:17:16,182 --> 01:17:20,270
The press is gonna kill us.

1100
01:17:20,436 --> 01:17:22,064
Can someone explain this to me?

1101
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:23,942
We can't yet.

1102
01:17:29,447 --> 01:17:32,533
How did this get away
from you, Jonas?

1103
01:17:32,701 --> 01:17:34,911
It's complicated, April.

1104
01:17:35,078 --> 01:17:37,497
He's very smart.
He's very angry.

1105
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:40,293
We assume he has an accomplice
helping him on the outside.

1106
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:44,088
I'm not having
this conversation.

1107
01:17:44,256 --> 01:17:47,801
I don't care how smart he is
or who's helping him.

1108
01:17:53,432 --> 01:17:57,061
We'll release a statement saying we
have suspects, we're following leads-

1109
01:17:57,229 --> 01:18:00,106
- nothing alarming.
- Mayor, you have my word,

1110
01:18:00,273 --> 01:18:04,360
we are gonna stop this guy.
He's not gonna hurt anybody else.

1111
01:18:09,033 --> 01:18:11,743
I'm assigning security to
each of you from now on.

1112
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:18,545
Get this situation
under control, gentlemen.

1113
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:36,981
Dad?

1114
01:18:37,148 --> 01:18:39,484
I bet you don't remember
when I did that.

1115
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:42,069
I bet you I do.

1116
01:18:57,088 --> 01:18:58,881
What?

1117
01:18:59,048 --> 01:19:00,759
Nothing.

1118
01:19:00,926 --> 01:19:04,220
You and your mother are going away
on a little vacation, that's all.

1119
01:19:04,387 --> 01:19:05,972
- You like vacations, right?
- Yeah.

1120
01:19:06,139 --> 01:19:08,015
Good.

1121
01:19:08,182 --> 01:19:09,893
But why?

1122
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,229
Why not now?

1123
01:19:12,395 --> 01:19:14,564
Okay.

1124
01:19:14,731 --> 01:19:17,569
Don't need an excuse, right?

1125
01:19:21,113 --> 01:19:22,408
All right.

1126
01:19:22,576 --> 01:19:26,537
No phone calls, no credit cards,
no computers- just cash.

1127
01:19:26,704 --> 01:19:28,289
Daddy, are you coming?

1128
01:19:28,457 --> 01:19:31,335
Oh, yeah, of course.

1129
01:19:31,502 --> 01:19:33,837
- Of course I am.
- You'd better, Nick.

1130
01:19:39,469 --> 01:19:41,304
It was first grade, hmm?

1131
01:19:41,470 --> 01:19:43,640
Your mother helped you
with the spelling.

1132
01:19:43,806 --> 01:19:45,975
It was my birthday.

1133
01:19:46,143 --> 01:19:48,936
- Man: We need to go!
- Let's go.

1134
01:19:49,104 --> 01:19:50,771
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

1135
01:19:50,939 --> 01:19:53,274
- Love you, Daddy.
- Love you too.

1136
01:19:58,157 --> 01:20:00,701
- Nick, your phone lines are clear.
- Good.

1137
01:20:00,868 --> 01:20:03,913
No bugs; nothing's been tampered with.
You're good.

1138
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:54,369
You should have taken my deal.

1139
01:21:58,667 --> 01:22:03,338
That's six fucking innocent people.
Is that how you want to play it? Huh?

1140
01:22:03,506 --> 01:22:06,425
It's okay.
It's okay, Nick. I know you're angry.

1141
01:22:06,591 --> 01:22:09,345
That's good. That's what it takes.
That's how it has to be.

1142
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:11,180
What if I said you was right
and I was wrong?

1143
01:22:11,346 --> 01:22:14,143
What if I had said, "Well,
let's take them to trial"? Huh?

1144
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,936
Then I would say
you're making progress.

1145
01:22:16,104 --> 01:22:19,315
And we might have lost!
And Ames and Darby would both go free.

1146
01:22:19,483 --> 01:22:21,944
Don't you get that?

1147
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:23,362
Fuck.

1148
01:22:23,529 --> 01:22:25,739
You didn't care, Nick.
You didn't even try.

1149
01:22:25,905 --> 01:22:28,618
You could have walked out of
that courtroom with your head held high.

1150
01:22:28,783 --> 01:22:30,536
I could have lived with that, Nick.

1151
01:22:30,703 --> 01:22:32,497
I keep my head up.

1152
01:22:32,662 --> 01:22:36,458
And you will end this.

1153
01:22:38,252 --> 01:22:40,380
I'm just getting warmed up.

1154
01:22:40,546 --> 01:22:43,300
This is Von Clausewitz shit-
total fucking war.

1155
01:22:43,466 --> 01:22:45,386
You fuck.

1156
01:22:50,685 --> 01:22:52,103
No.

1157
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,365
I'm gonna pull
the whole thing down.

1158
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:07,494
I'm gonna bring the whole
fucking diseased, corrupt temple

1159
01:23:07,661 --> 01:23:10,122
down on your head.

1160
01:23:10,288 --> 01:23:12,875
It's gonna be Biblical.

1161
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:33,399
Cantrell:
Jesus, Nick, she was a good kid.

1162
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:36,778
Did we bring this all on ourselves?

1163
01:23:39,154 --> 01:23:41,490
Absolutely not.

1164
01:23:43,701 --> 01:23:46,203
You don't actually believe that,
do you?

1165
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,503
Gentlemen? Sorry,
but we need to get going

1166
01:23:53,671 --> 01:23:56,091
if we're going to make it
to the press conference.

1167
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:07,979
I want to read you something
from my speech before we go.

1168
01:24:11,149 --> 01:24:13,152
"We must not give in
to the fear.

1169
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:16,072
We must face
those things we fear the most.

1170
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:18,573
We must appeaI
to our better angels. "

1171
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,701
Too much?

1172
01:24:20,868 --> 01:24:22,787
I'm sorry.

1173
01:24:22,953 --> 01:24:26,541
It's just before, when you asked
if we brought this on ourselves-

1174
01:24:26,707 --> 01:24:28,792
we didn't.

1175
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,546
I did.

1176
01:24:32,506 --> 01:24:36,720
When I was young,
I really wanted to change the system.

1177
01:24:36,887 --> 01:24:41,559
You know, I was ready to fight.
I was gonna be the best no matter what.

1178
01:24:41,725 --> 01:24:43,936
You give an inch here,
you give an inch there,

1179
01:24:43,972 --> 01:24:46,773
you get caught up
in the game.

1180
01:24:46,939 --> 01:24:50,443
And then you realize that the system
that you're trying to change-

1181
01:24:50,609 --> 01:24:53,113
it changed you.

1182
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:55,198
Jonas, I've lost my way
somewhere.

1183
01:24:55,364 --> 01:24:57,868
Look, remember what I told you?

1184
01:24:58,034 --> 01:25:01,706
The hard part isn't
making the decisión.

1185
01:25:01,872 --> 01:25:05,795
It's living with it.

1186
01:25:09,215 --> 01:25:12,176
Everybody stay sharp.

1187
01:25:12,344 --> 01:25:13,929
We're on the move.

1188
01:26:34,728 --> 01:26:36,729
- We all right?
- Dunnigan: It's dead.

1189
01:26:36,895 --> 01:26:38,731
Electrical system's fried.

1190
01:26:38,898 --> 01:26:41,150
Man over radio:
What's going on back there?

1191
01:26:44,195 --> 01:26:46,367
Dunnigan, tell them to
get Jonas away from here.

1192
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:57,045
What the fuck is that?

1193
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:00,673
Get down, get down!

1194
01:27:24,952 --> 01:27:27,371
Jonas! Jonas!

1195
01:27:28,372 --> 01:27:29,997
- Jonas! Jonas!
- No, Nick! Get back!

1196
01:27:31,457 --> 01:27:33,793
Jonas! Get your hands off me!

1197
01:27:33,961 --> 01:27:36,630
Jonas! Get out of the car!
Jonas!

1198
01:27:36,796 --> 01:27:38,884
Get out of the car! Get off of me!

1199
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:40,467
Dunnigan:
Please listen to me!

1200
01:27:47,516 --> 01:27:49,060
Jonas!

1201
01:27:49,226 --> 01:27:51,020
Jonas.

1202
01:28:11,545 --> 01:28:14,381
I told you to handle this.

1203
01:28:14,547 --> 01:28:16,550
You didn't.

1204
01:28:16,716 --> 01:28:18,217
Now we have a jailed psychopath

1205
01:28:18,385 --> 01:28:21,805
that's managed to bring this
entire city to its knees.

1206
01:28:22,932 --> 01:28:25,685
One of my friends
was just murdered.

1207
01:28:26,685 --> 01:28:30,442
More than one of my friends
is gone, Mayor.

1208
01:28:30,609 --> 01:28:33,362
What I should do is fire you.

1209
01:28:33,529 --> 01:28:35,989
Hmm?
Right now.

1210
01:28:37,073 --> 01:28:39,868
I resign.

1211
01:28:40,034 --> 01:28:44,081
- Is that your real answer?
- I think that's best.

1212
01:28:49,003 --> 01:28:50,588
No.

1213
01:28:51,631 --> 01:28:53,926
I'm not gonna allow that to happen.
Bring me the Bible.

1214
01:28:54,091 --> 01:28:58,514
I'm not gonna let some criminal decide
whether Philadelphia has a DA or not.

1215
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,100
As of now, you're acting
District Attorney.

1216
01:29:01,265 --> 01:29:04,271
We'll have a formal
swearing in later.

1217
01:29:04,438 --> 01:29:07,649
For now this will suffice.
Stand up.

1218
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,822
Put your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.

1219
01:29:11,988 --> 01:29:13,823
Repeat after me.

1220
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:15,951
- I, Nicolas Rice...
- I, Nicolas Rice...

1221
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:18,162
- ... do solemnly swear...
- ... do solemnly swear...

1222
01:29:18,328 --> 01:29:20,122
- ... that I will support...
- ... that I will support...

1223
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:21,372
- ... obey...
- ... obey...

1224
01:29:21,539 --> 01:29:24,210
...and defend the Constitution
of the United States...

1225
01:29:24,376 --> 01:29:26,252
...and defend the
Constitution of the United States...

1226
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:29,381
...and the Constitution of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania...

1227
01:29:38,394 --> 01:29:41,188
People aren't going to work;
kids aren't going to schooI.

1228
01:29:41,354 --> 01:29:43,815
They're scared,
and I don't blame them.

1229
01:29:43,983 --> 01:29:48,194
So I'm implementing the emergency
provisión of the Philadelphia code.

1230
01:29:48,362 --> 01:29:49,654
We're gonna lock this city down.

1231
01:29:49,822 --> 01:29:52,992
Starting now, no one moves
in this city unrestricted.

1232
01:29:53,451 --> 01:29:55,787
I want a show of force
for the public-

1233
01:29:55,953 --> 01:29:58,539
uniforms, detectives,
12-hour shifts.

1234
01:29:58,707 --> 01:30:00,583
Put an armed cop on every corner.

1235
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:03,378
If you have to give shotguns
to the meter maids, do it.

1236
01:30:03,545 --> 01:30:05,631
There should be no doubt
in people's minds

1237
01:30:05,797 --> 01:30:09,092
that this city is secure
and under our control.

1238
01:30:12,097 --> 01:30:13,807
Okay.

1239
01:30:19,355 --> 01:30:23,027
Okay, Clyde.
I get it.

1240
01:30:26,738 --> 01:30:29,824
Listen, that contraption
that killed Cantrell,

1241
01:30:29,992 --> 01:30:33,246
it was a weaponized
bomb-disposal robot.

1242
01:30:33,412 --> 01:30:34,454
Can you believe that?

1243
01:30:34,622 --> 01:30:37,542
Damn thing had video, night visión-
you name it.

1244
01:30:37,707 --> 01:30:40,837
It's like military APl,
for Christ's sakes.

1245
01:30:41,003 --> 01:30:43,881
That's anti-tank rounds, Nick.

1246
01:30:44,048 --> 01:30:45,970
I think he's saving you for last.

1247
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:51,016
Nick, I'm serious.

1248
01:30:52,685 --> 01:30:55,604
I appreciate the insight.

1249
01:30:59,274 --> 01:31:02,695
Nick, you gotta get in front of
this guy if you want to stay alive.

1250
01:31:05,533 --> 01:31:07,576
I may have a way-

1251
01:31:07,743 --> 01:31:11,329
something a friend
is helping me out with.

1252
01:31:11,497 --> 01:31:12,872
Who's your friend?

1253
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:15,667
A friend named Chester.
I'll call you back.

1254
01:31:17,461 --> 01:31:19,716
Thank you, Sarah.

1255
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:29,851
This is Nick.
Give me the real-estate listing

1256
01:31:30,019 --> 01:31:33,439
of every industrial property sold
here in the last 10 years.

1257
01:31:58,967 --> 01:32:01,386
Motherfucker.

1258
01:32:19,739 --> 01:32:21,533
You're kidding me, right?

1259
01:32:22,534 --> 01:32:24,953
You're saying Clyde
owns this place?

1260
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:28,042
Something about it
sticks out, right?

1261
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:30,127
Yeah.

1262
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:36,469
What- are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

1263
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:41,224
- What about his civil rights?
- Fuck his civiI rights.

1264
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:46,061
Yes!

1265
01:33:31,029 --> 01:33:33,448
There's got to be
something in here.

1266
01:33:33,614 --> 01:33:35,327
Dunnigan: Yeah.

1267
01:33:51,051 --> 01:33:53,680
Remember this from
outside the house?

1268
01:34:00,604 --> 01:34:02,189
Yeah.

1269
01:34:02,354 --> 01:34:04,233
Get that right there.

1270
01:34:20,836 --> 01:34:23,546
Dunnigan:
Un-fucking-believable.

1271
01:34:37,228 --> 01:34:39,480
Look at this.

1272
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:46,657
Watch your step.

1273
01:34:51,997 --> 01:34:54,623
This guy tunneled into prison?

1274
01:35:22,322 --> 01:35:24,615
Oh, shit.

1275
01:35:29,537 --> 01:35:31,539
Fuck- Semtex.

1276
01:35:35,795 --> 01:35:39,423
Got police uniforms,
other disguises.

1277
01:36:03,034 --> 01:36:05,078
He tunneled into every cell.

1278
01:36:06,078 --> 01:36:07,788
Over here.

1279
01:36:14,128 --> 01:36:16,672
He wanted to be
transferred to solitary.

1280
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,551
Surprise, motherfucker.

1281
01:37:02,475 --> 01:37:05,604
- He's not here!
- If he's not there, then where is he?

1282
01:37:11,319 --> 01:37:12,945
Nomos, what happened to your eye?

1283
01:37:13,113 --> 01:37:14,614
Oh, long story.

1284
01:37:14,782 --> 01:37:17,743
Stop right there, sir.

1285
01:37:17,909 --> 01:37:20,037
Let me see your ID, please.

1286
01:37:20,203 --> 01:37:22,247
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1287
01:37:22,413 --> 01:37:24,958
Turn around, sir.
Extend your arms.

1288
01:37:26,668 --> 01:37:28,295
Something going on tonight?

1289
01:37:28,462 --> 01:37:31,882
- The mayor.
- Mmm, mayor.

1290
01:37:39,393 --> 01:37:41,395
Look at this.

1291
01:37:41,561 --> 01:37:44,023
He tapped into the prison cameras.

1292
01:37:44,189 --> 01:37:46,274
Jesus, he's got
cameras everywhere.

1293
01:37:46,442 --> 01:37:48,194
- Shit.
- Is that your house?

1294
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:51,197
Yes.

1295
01:37:52,198 --> 01:37:54,659
Baby, please tell me you're okay.

1296
01:37:54,826 --> 01:37:56,286
Denise- where is she?

1297
01:37:56,453 --> 01:37:58,162
Is she with you?
Are you sure?

1298
01:37:58,329 --> 01:38:00,082
Okay.

1299
01:38:00,248 --> 01:38:02,710
Stay where you are.
I'll explain later.

1300
01:38:02,876 --> 01:38:04,712
I love you.

1301
01:38:14,725 --> 01:38:16,935
Nick:
Von Clausewitz.

1302
01:38:21,439 --> 01:38:22,983
Look at that.

1303
01:38:30,365 --> 01:38:32,158
He's at City Hall.

1304
01:38:33,661 --> 01:38:35,704
You're free to go, sir.

1305
01:38:35,871 --> 01:38:38,876
- Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
- No, don't worry about it.

1306
01:38:40,293 --> 01:38:42,922
Better to be safe
than sorry, right?

1307
01:38:44,382 --> 01:38:46,426
Dunnigan:
Get ready to evacuate the building.

1308
01:38:46,594 --> 01:38:48,595
We'll need a tactical unit
and a bomb squad.

1309
01:38:48,762 --> 01:38:50,014
Bad idea.
Have them come in soft.

1310
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:52,850
If Shelton spots them or
any of us, we're fucked.

1311
01:39:16,627 --> 01:39:18,921
Hey.

1312
01:39:21,466 --> 01:39:23,092
- Where's the tactical team?
- En route.

1313
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:25,470
- They're coming in soft- no sirens.
- Bomb squad?

1314
01:39:25,637 --> 01:39:27,180
You're looking at it.

1315
01:39:27,347 --> 01:39:30,643
Right, okay. We take the north surge;
you take the west.

1316
01:39:30,810 --> 01:39:32,228
We'll call.

1317
01:39:37,274 --> 01:39:38,859
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- IDs, please.

1318
01:39:39,025 --> 01:39:41,444
- He's the fucking DA.
- Good for him. IDs, please.

1319
01:39:41,612 --> 01:39:43,613
What's going on here tonight?

1320
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:45,993
- Security meeting with all the brass.
- What floor?

1321
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:48,078
6th floor- caucus room.

1322
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,753
- What floor is this?
- That's the 5th floor, sir.

1323
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:56,963
Directly below the caucus room.

1324
01:39:57,131 --> 01:40:00,885
You catch this motherfucker red-handed,
we gotta take him alive.

1325
01:40:22,992 --> 01:40:24,828
Where is he?

1326
01:40:24,996 --> 01:40:27,582
What the fuck are we looking for?

1327
01:40:27,748 --> 01:40:29,833
Wait wait wait.

1328
01:40:30,001 --> 01:40:31,212
Right there.

1329
01:40:31,378 --> 01:40:34,090
Garza: Stand back.
Don't touch anything.

1330
01:40:35,382 --> 01:40:38,136
It wasn't exactly my first instinct.

1331
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:19,140
Can I see your ID, please?

1332
01:41:26,189 --> 01:41:28,565
All right, next car, pull forward!

1333
01:42:03,104 --> 01:42:06,650
Garza:
Malglinite.

1334
01:42:06,817 --> 01:42:09,322
That's napalm, basically.
This shit'll take out the entire floor

1335
01:42:09,488 --> 01:42:11,323
and the one above us.

1336
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:15,494
Looks like it's- looks like it's
triggered by this cell phone here.

1337
01:42:15,662 --> 01:42:19,791
What?
So an incoming call arms it?

1338
01:42:19,957 --> 01:42:23,920
Yeah. Maybe 30 seconds
till boom time.

1339
01:42:24,921 --> 01:42:27,216
- Jesus.
- Dunnigan, what are you doing?

1340
01:42:27,382 --> 01:42:29,051
- I'm calling the mayor's security.
- We can't.

1341
01:42:29,217 --> 01:42:32,596
Clyde is watching. He sees him evacuate
and he will detonate this thing.

1342
01:42:32,764 --> 01:42:35,390
We don't tell the mayor anything.

1343
01:42:37,976 --> 01:42:39,938
So what do we do?

1344
01:42:50,493 --> 01:42:52,162
Wait a second.

1345
01:42:52,328 --> 01:42:54,204
We've got something.

1346
01:42:54,372 --> 01:42:56,207
Man over radio:
He's pulling up.

1347
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:20,402
Mayor April Henry.

1348
01:43:29,994 --> 01:43:32,664
Thank you for coming in
on short notice.

1349
01:43:39,381 --> 01:43:40,840
I have one simple question.

1350
01:43:43,301 --> 01:43:46,304
Why is Clyde Shelton still in my city?

1351
01:43:48,265 --> 01:43:50,394
Now I refuse to believe

1352
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:54,981
that one man is smarter
than Homeland Security,

1353
01:43:55,149 --> 01:43:59,570
the FBl, the sheriff's department,
or Philly PD.

1354
01:43:59,738 --> 01:44:01,989
I don't care how we do it,
or what kind

1355
01:44:02,157 --> 01:44:05,409
of obscure legaI justification
we have to invoke, gentlemen.

1356
01:44:05,577 --> 01:44:08,622
I don't care what laws
we have to bend.

1357
01:44:08,788 --> 01:44:12,708
I am sure that there is a provisión
of the Homeland Security Act

1358
01:44:12,876 --> 01:44:15,462
that we can activate.

1359
01:44:15,628 --> 01:44:18,757
Just get him out of here
by tomorrow.

1360
01:44:25,475 --> 01:44:26,976
Nick: Clyde?

1361
01:44:31,355 --> 01:44:33,609
Nick.

1362
01:44:33,774 --> 01:44:35,694
I wasn't expecting company.

1363
01:44:39,113 --> 01:44:42,243
Yeah, I would have-
I would have cleaned up a little.

1364
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:45,204
Never seen anybody
tunnel into prison before.

1365
01:44:51,002 --> 01:44:54,965
And the solitary confinement?
That was clever.

1366
01:44:55,131 --> 01:44:57,466
Well, that's how winners play.

1367
01:44:57,634 --> 01:45:00,805
We convince the other guy
he's making all the right moves.

1368
01:45:01,806 --> 01:45:04,310
So did you ever catch my accomplice?

1369
01:45:04,478 --> 01:45:06,145
Yeah, I did.

1370
01:45:06,313 --> 01:45:08,689
It's the end of the road
for you now.

1371
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:15,697
You played us, Clyde.
You played us real good.

1372
01:45:15,863 --> 01:45:17,740
Thank you.

1373
01:45:17,908 --> 01:45:20,953
You know, I'm glad you finally
get to appreciate

1374
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,037
some of the effort that
I put into all of this.

1375
01:45:23,204 --> 01:45:25,457
Well, you set out to
make a point, Clyde.

1376
01:45:25,623 --> 01:45:26,710
You made it.

1377
01:45:26,876 --> 01:45:28,587
No, people still don't get it.

1378
01:45:28,752 --> 01:45:32,509
They don't appreciate what I'm trying
to say, Nick, but they will soon enough.

1379
01:45:32,676 --> 01:45:34,552
A man I cared about
once told me

1380
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,889
that we can't retract
the decisions that we've made,

1381
01:45:37,055 --> 01:45:39,600
we can only affect the decisions
we're going to make from here.

1382
01:45:39,766 --> 01:45:42,560
- Are you trying to save me now, Nick?
- I'm giving you a way out.

1383
01:45:42,728 --> 01:45:44,354
Big difference.

1384
01:45:44,521 --> 01:45:46,606
Stand up for those principles
you've been preaching.

1385
01:45:46,774 --> 01:45:50,362
See, we're all held accountable, Clyde.
That includes you.

1386
01:45:50,529 --> 01:45:52,197
Why don't we do
the right thing here?

1387
01:45:53,198 --> 01:45:55,701
I'm doing the right thing, Nick.

1388
01:45:57,703 --> 01:45:59,371
You just have to see it that way.

1389
01:45:59,537 --> 01:46:00,913
By murdering all those people,

1390
01:46:01,081 --> 01:46:03,917
all you're doing is
destroying the memory of your daughter

1391
01:46:04,083 --> 01:46:07,631
and causing the same pain
that you're suffering from.

1392
01:46:14,347 --> 01:46:18,769
So what do you suggest, Nick?
Make another deaI?

1393
01:46:18,935 --> 01:46:22,021
One final offer?
Is that what it is?

1394
01:46:24,984 --> 01:46:28,654
I don't make deals with
murderers anymore, Clyde.

1395
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:30,823
You taught me that.

1396
01:46:35,369 --> 01:46:39,082
Finally.

1397
01:46:41,252 --> 01:46:43,838
Well done. Bravo.

1398
01:46:44,006 --> 01:46:46,966
Maybe I wasn't such
a bad teacher after all.

1399
01:46:47,134 --> 01:46:49,345
If you go through with this, Clyde,
it's a decisión

1400
01:46:49,511 --> 01:46:52,097
you'll have to live with
for the rest of your life.

1401
01:47:15,957 --> 01:47:17,835
I'm sorry, Nick.

1402
01:47:20,506 --> 01:47:22,423
Me too.

1403
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,478
Like I said, Clyde,

1404
01:47:34,645 --> 01:47:37,605
it's a decisión you'll have to
live with for the rest of your life,

1405
01:47:37,773 --> 01:47:41,109
which I figure by now
is about 25 more seconds.

1406
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:13,726
# Ain't seen a night #

1407
01:51:13,893 --> 01:51:16,563
# Things work out right #

1408
01:51:16,729 --> 01:51:20,108
# Go by #

1409
01:51:22,234 --> 01:51:24,613
# Things on my mind #

1410
01:51:24,779 --> 01:51:27,239
# And I just don't have the time #

1411
01:51:27,407 --> 01:51:30,869
# And it don't seem right #

1412
01:51:33,622 --> 01:51:35,707
# Ain't seen a day #

1413
01:51:35,875 --> 01:51:38,670
# That I don't hear people say #

1414
01:51:38,837 --> 01:51:41,922
# They know they're gonna die #

1415
01:51:44,967 --> 01:51:47,847
# This may seem a little bit crazy #

1416
01:51:48,015 --> 01:51:52,226
# But I don't think you
should be so lazy #

1417
01:51:56,231 --> 01:51:58,693
# If you think
you've heard this before #

1418
01:51:58,859 --> 01:52:00,694
# Well, stick around #

1419
01:52:00,862 --> 01:52:04,573
# I'm gonna tell you more #

1420
01:53:31,172 --> 01:53:34,009
# One just like the other #

1421
01:53:34,176 --> 01:53:36,136
# Sin's a good man's brother #

1422
01:53:36,302 --> 01:53:40,015
# But is that right? #

1423
01:53:42,434 --> 01:53:44,936
# You tell me that I don't #

1424
01:53:45,104 --> 01:53:47,314
# Then I say I won't #

1425
01:53:47,481 --> 01:53:51,235
# But then I might #

1426
01:53:53,947 --> 01:53:56,658
# You said this is the way
it's supposed to be #

1427
01:53:56,824 --> 01:53:59,328
# But it just don't seem
right to me #

1428
01:53:59,493 --> 01:54:03,457
# And that's outta sight #

1429
01:54:05,043 --> 01:54:07,962
# Some folks need an education #

1430
01:54:08,130 --> 01:54:12,511
# Don't give up
or we'll lose the nation #

1431
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:19,184
# You say we need a revolution? #

1432
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:20,685
# It seems to be #

1433
01:54:20,853 --> 01:54:24,814
# The only solution. #
