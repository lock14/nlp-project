Coyotes, go! Get! Back! Back, coyotes!

13

Get out here! You not eat another baby.

You ugly black one, too.
You be here long time.

17

Nobody ever come and say,
"Give me the ugly, black one."

18
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,000

The ugliest baby I ever seen.

<i>so I was buddyless for a while.</i>

60

<i>And because of Rasputia,</i>
<i>for the first time in my life,</i>

<i>I had a real family.</i>

84

128

"Hos, ain't no man gonna pay for
the cow if he can get the milk for free."

130

You ain't got to worry

'cause he just bought
the whole damn cow.

Sing that shit, girl.

135
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,400
Them are not dimples.
Them are potholes in her ass.

136
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,800
Look like an Escalade

-Oh, yeah. Way jealous.
-Wish I had one like that.

141

Norbit, let me talk to you for a second.

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,100
Look, just so we clear.

143
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,600
lf you ever hurt my sister in any way,

144
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,500
make her cry,
even make her sad one time,

145
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,200
I'm coming at you

-You hear me?
-Yes.

147
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm talking pain, boy.

148
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,800
Searing, mind-numbing pain.

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,400
I understand.

150
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,700
-You understand me?
-Yes, yes, yes.

151
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,100
all right.

152
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,600
-Welcome to the family.
-Thank you.

What y'all looking at?
I ain't had no cake.

155
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,200
You better mind your damn business.

156
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,600
Hey, hey! Everyone!

157
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,300
I am Mr. Wong.
I am best man in wedding.

158
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,800
I feel it my place to say something,
make a toast to bride and groom,

159
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,800
tell story about Norbit.
I like Norbit father.

160
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,500
I raise Norbit. He like my own child.

161
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,000
And I want to say that
I very, very confused, Norbit,

162
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,400
that you... You marry Latimore.

163
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,300
I don't understand it, because
when you was a little boy, you say,

164
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,800
"One day I find the girI of my dreams."
And then you marry a gorilla.

165
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
I joke, I joke, I joke.

166
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Why you not know joke
when you hear joke?

167
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,200
Why you wanna make fight at wedding?

168
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,700
CooI off, before I have to
bust somebody ass in here. Okay.

169
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,600
When Norbit just little boy,

170
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,000
he like to always
run all over place naked. Always naked.

171
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,800
And Norbit, when he was just little boy,
had a pee-pee the size of an egg roll.

172
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,100
-You know, Norbit.
-That's true.

173
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,000
And one day, down by creek,
Norbit run around naked

174
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,100
and poisonous snake jump up
and bite Norbit right on ass.

175
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,900
Very close to hole.

176
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Norbit pass out. I think Norbit is dead.

177
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,300
I go to check the boy puIse.
He still allve. He still allve!

178
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,000
"Okay," I say,
"I must do something to save child."

179
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,200
So, I start to think,

180
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,200
"Do I suck poison out of Norbit's ass
or do I let him die?"

181
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,800
I do the most responsible thing.

182
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,900
I say, "Hell to the no!

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,900
"Norbit is out of here,

184
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,900
"because it is long time in hell

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,400
"before Wong suck poison
out of another man's ass."

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,400
But strange, mystical thing
happen, Norbit.

187
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,600
Even though poison is in Norbit,
he not die.

188
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,100
Norbit get stronger and stronger.

189
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,600
That why I know, Norbit,
deep down inside, you very, very strong.

190
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,800
You strong like warrior.

191
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,200
That's why I say to you, Norbit,
you can survive anything.

192
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
Even...

193
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,000
So I say to everyone here, and to Norbit,

194
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,700
I wish you much happiness and peace
and love,

195
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,400
and lots of bananas for your new gorilla.

196
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,500
I only kidding. To Norbit and Rasputia.

197
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,000
Norbit, you know
what would be so romantic?

198
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,200
lf you'd carry me over the threshold
like a little chocolate drop.

199
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,300
Be delicate, now.

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,900
Put your back into it.

201
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,400
Come on, now. Be a man.
You ain't no man.

202
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,600
Pathetic.

203
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,100
Rasputia, I know we're both nervous
because we've never done this before,

204
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,800
but we can take our time, darling.
ln sweet time.

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,400
<i>Rasputia was so fulI of love.</i>

206
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,500
Merry Christmas!

207
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,400
Ho, ho, ho!

208
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,000
<i>It was a love that sustained us</i>
<i>through the years.</i>

209
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,200
HaIt!

210
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,800
187. Officer down.

211
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,100
<i>And it's still going strong.</i>

212
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,600
Happy Presidents' Day!

213
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,400
God bless America.

214
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,600
<i>And so, we began our life together,</i>
<i>like any other happily married couple.</i>

215
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,400
Morning, Rasputia.

216
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,000
"Morning, Rasputia," my ass.

217
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,200
I tell you what. You better do something
about that goddamn dog,

218
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,500
because I ain't gonna be
getting terrorized

219
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,900
by no dog on my own property.

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,200
I'm sick of it! I'm gonna go out
and purchase me a pellet rifle!

221
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,800
And then I'm gonna give him
something to bark about

222
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,500
when I start popping pellets
in his little bug-eyed bastard's ass.

223
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,000
Messing around with you,
now I'm gonna be late for dance class.

224
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,300
God damn it, Norbit.

225
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
How many times I got to tell you, when
you drive my car, don't adjust my seat!

226
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,900
-I haven't touched your seat.
-Then why is it up so damn far?

227
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,200
It looks like it's back
as far as it goes, Rasputia.

228
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,900
No, you moved it. I can tell, 'cause look,

229
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,900
when I inhale,
my titty make the horn honk. Listen.

230
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,300
You see that?

231
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,100
-That ain't right.
-I hear it.

232
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,300
That scientifically prove
that you was adjusting my seat.

233
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,500
-That's not science.
-It is. Now just let it go.

234
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
-It's not science.
-I said let it go.

235
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,800
-I'm just...
-I said it was science, God damn it.

236
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Why you think I want to sell
Golden Wonton Restaurant?

237
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,600
I got a good business.

238
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,200
It practically run itself.
I make a lot of money here.

239
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,600
Every man got a price.
We think this might be yours.

240
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,900
And here is my counteroffer.

241
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,000
-Excuse me.

242
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,800
I not like rest of town people.
I not intimidated by Latimore.

243
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,700
-You wrong, Wong. Relax, man.
-Be cooI with that thing, Mr. Wong.

244
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,500
Ling Ling, get my pistol!

245
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,700
That dude is crazy.
Let's get the hell out of here!

246
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,400

256
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,100
I stepped in poo, better wipe it off.
One, two, three, four.

257
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,900
Now, pump, pump, pump, pump,

265
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
Pump, pump, pump, pump,

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,200
And one, two, three, four, five, six,

Very good.

269
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,000
Excuse me, Buster?

270
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,700
I think I need
a little adjustment over here.

271
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,000
Look at you,
looking like the Great Pumpkin, girl.

272
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,900
Trick or treat. What's going on?

273
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,200
Well, see, I was born with a trick hip
and it made me real bendy.

274
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,800
See, I'm just like licorice. Look.

275
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,300
Goddamn, girl,
that look like the harvest moon.

276
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,600
-Turn a brother to a werewolf.
-You just need to stop.

277
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,000
You know what?
Do you do any private lessons?

278
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,100
I could do private lessons
if you could do me a little favor.

279
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,300
What's that?

280
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,000
Just need you talk to your little brothers
about funding my little video tape.

281
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,900
I'm trying to make power-tap
more international.

282
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,500
I'm trying to be like Billy Blanks,

283
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,200
but double the money
and half the Blank.

284
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,100
That's a good idea.

285
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,300
Maybe I will, maybe I will.
But, first, I got to get that private lesson.

286
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,500
Okay. Call me, girl.

287
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
-I'll call you.
-I'll be your private dancer.

288
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,200
-Must be Saturday.
-Why is that?

289
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,100
Because here come Norbit,
right on schedule.

290
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,100
Almost set your watch to him.

291
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,600
Hey, Pope Sweet Jesus
and Lord Have Mercy.

292
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,900
How you guys doing, fellows?

293
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Business is good.

294
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,700
Business is good.
It's almost like the good old days.

295
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Yes, indeedy.

296
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,100
What do you mean,
"the good old days"?

297
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,800
The good old days, man,
back when we was pimping, Norbit.

298
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,900
You know.

299
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,300
-You guys used to pimp?
-"Used to"?

300
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,700
That's a violation. still pimping.
Once a pimp, always a pimp.

301
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,000
-Always. Forever.
-Boss player.

302
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Rasputia sent me down here
to get the usual.

303
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
You guys are open, right?

304
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
We always open.
Go on and take yourself in there, Norbit.

305
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,800
We'll stack that up for you.

306
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,900
-Moniqua!
-Yes, Daddy.

307
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,500
Can you get King Kong
three large buckets, extra sauce?

308
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,100
-Please don't trim the fat.
-Yes, Daddy.

309
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,400
Please don't trim that fat.
She wilI kilI me.

310
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,000
Norbit, while I got your attention,

311
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,400
can I interest you in some new shoes,
maybe a haircut?

312
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
How about a bath or a sink?

313
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,200
Hey, don't tell me
you guys bought the bath store, too?

314
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,700
It's a perfect fit, man.
We used to sell bitches to johns.

315
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,200
Now we selling johns to bitches.

316
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,500
-Beds, bitches, and beyond!
-Sound like money to me.

317
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,700
No, thanks, guys.

318
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,000
I got to go do a puppet show
for the kids at the orphanage.

319
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,000
At the orphanage?

320
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,400
That's a nice thing you do
for them little kids over there.

321
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,000
Why don't you take
these little tater puffs

322
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
over there to them little children?

323
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,300
Oh, that's great, guys. That's sweet.

324
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,100
Wait, my puppets! I forgot my puppets!

325
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,600

326
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,600
-Where's his puppets?
-He ain't got no puppets.

327
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,300
What's Rasputia doing home so early?

328
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,500

329
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh, yeah, girl.

330
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,700
Come on, girl, that's sweet chocolate!

331
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,400
Okay, you in trouble, now.
You in trouble. You in trouble, now.

332
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm Willy Wonka.
Get up on that Oompa Loompa.

333
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,300
That's sweet. Oh, yeah.
Take all that, girl.

334
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,100
Take it with your big old self, girl.
You ain't never had it like this.

335
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,400
You ain't never had it like this!

336
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,200
Hell, yeah.
Come on, we gonna do pig in a blanket.

337
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,700
Come on, pig in a blanket.

338
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,400
-Now squeal. Squeal! Squeal!
-Oink, oink, oink!

339
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,600
Take it from the back.

340
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,400
Damn, I feel like Willy Wonka,
all this sweet chocolate up in this...

341
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:42,000
Hey. How you doing, man?
What's good with you, brother?

342
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,200
How's it going, man? How you doing?

343
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm Bust-a-move Perkin.
How you doing?

344
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,100
Man, your wife was
just talking about you.

345
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,900
Man, she love you.

346
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,200
-You're Rasputia's tap dance teacher.
-Man, actually, I'm her power-tap guru.

347
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,900
I was just here
giving her a little tap lesson.

348
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,700
But you're naked.

349
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,300
That's just so she could see
the various muscle groups

350
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,800
as I go through the various routines.

351
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,500
You see that there?
You can't see that with a turtleneck.

352
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,600
And you have an...

353
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,800
Oh, man,
I'm just real passionate about dance.

354
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,500
You can say the word "dance"
and he just jump up. Dance!

355
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,400
See that? See that there?

356
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
'Sputia?

357
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,800
Norbit, Buster's a guest in our home.

358
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
How dare you insinuate
something like that?

359
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,300
Yeah, Orbit!

360
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,700
How dare you insinuate
something such like that!

361
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,500
You know, I am actually offended
by your accusization, you understand?

362
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,000
And rather than sit here and have
a belligerent confrontation with you,

363
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,500
'cause I am a God-fearing man,

364
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm'a do like Jesus H. Christ
would do in a situation such as such

365
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,900
and I'm gonna turn the other cheek.

366
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,300
Amen.

367
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,900
You happy now?

368
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,000
Rasputia, you cheated on me!

369
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,800
Look, I told your ass
ain't nothing happened,

370
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,900
and the next time you say
it happened again,

371
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,500
I'm gonna knock your teeth
out your mouth.

372
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,600
Rasputia, we took vows.
I'm your husband.

373
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,100
Rasputia, we took vows,
and you cheated on me!

374
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,300
It never happened!

375
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,500
Yes, it did!

376
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,700
And that makes you
the queen of whores!

377
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,600
Hey, Norbit!

378
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,700
Run for your lives!

379
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,100
Bastard! Come here!

380
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, sweet Moses! Oh, my God!

381
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,400
Come here! Come here!
Come here to me!

382
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,700
No! Leave me alone!

383
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,400
You ain't nothing
but a goddamn coward!

384
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,900
Saddle tramp!

385
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,000
That's what your stupid black ass get!

386
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,200
I hope you broke your ass!

387
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,500
Since you feel like running, Norbit,

388
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,400
why don't you run your ass
down to the Rib Shak

389
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,900
and get me a short stack of ribs?

390
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,800
and get me a short stack of ribs?

391
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,400
Extra hot sauce.

392
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,900
all this setting you straight
done got me famished.

393
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,900
I'm Little Red Riding Goose,

394
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,700
walking through the forest,
minding my own business,

395
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,700
when all at once...

396
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,900
Hello.

397
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,700
-Who are you?
-I'm the big, bad pig of the forest.

398
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,500
My, what big eyes you have, Pig.

399
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
The better to see you with, Goose.

400
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,000
And my, what a big nose you have, Pig.

401
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,700
The better to smelI them scrumptious
goodies you got in your basket.

402
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,500
Hey, let me take a look in there.

403
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,700
Oh, no, you don't.
You're gonna try to steaI my food.

404
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,300
No, I won't steaI your food.

405
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,200
Don't let that pig
push you around, Goose.

406
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,400
Yeah, I'm tired of
you pushing me around.

407
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,600
Look, I'm tired of
playing with your ass, bitch.

408
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,300
I know you got ribs in that basket.

409
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,800
You better give them up smooth

410
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,300
or I'm gonna break my hoof off
in your goose ass.

411
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,200
Oh, really? Well, why don't you get up
off of your lazy behind

412
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,400
and go down to the Rib Shak
and get your own ribs?

413
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,100
Or better still,
why don't you just call Buster

414
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,300
and tell him to come over
and power-tap you,

415
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,600
because in addition to being
the pig of the forest,

416
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,500
you're aIso a saddle tramp,
whore, bitch pig...

417
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,700
Norbit! What you doing?
This supposed to be a children's show.

418
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,800
This remind me
of Chinese snuff film I once co-star in.

419
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,400
I'm sorry. I got a little carried away.

420
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Wow, Norbit,
that was some puppet show.

421
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,100
Oh, come on. You don't remember me?

422
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,400
-Kate. Kate.
-Come here!

423
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,900
Kate! Kate! Oh, God!
I can't believe it! Kate!

424
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,300
Well, can I have a hug?

425
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,700
Norbit.

426
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,400
It just like old times.

427
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,200
Maybe you two go take poop together.

428
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,100
This place has not changed at all.

429
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,900
Oh, yeah. Some of this furniture's
even come back in style.

430
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,300
So, how long are
you gonna be visiting for?

431
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,600
No, I'm not visiting. I'm moving back.

432
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,600
Really? Wow.

433
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,400
I sold my clothing business in Atlanta,

434
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,700
and I'm going to use the money
to buy the orphanage.

435
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,200
What?

436
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,300
Mr. Wong's getting older.
He wants to go whallng, so...

437
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,800
You know, it's always been my dream
to come back here and take over.

438
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,900
That's great.

439
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,100
Norbit, look.

440
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,600
That's the tree we got married under.

441
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,400
You know, I've still got my ring.

442
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,200
I ate mine.

443
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,400
I missed you so much when you left.

444
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,500
I missed you, too.

445
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,600
That's my car.

446
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,900
We didn't really get a chance
to catch up much.

447
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,500
I'll be back in town on Tuesday.
You wanna have lunch?

448
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,600
Yeah, I would love to
have lunch on Tuesday.

449
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,900
-I love lunch.
-Okay.

450
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,800
Lunch, yes. For sure.
I love lunch. Tuesday.

451
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,300
I'll see you Tuesday.

452
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,000
I'll see you on Tuesday.
We'll have lunch on Tuesday.

453
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,500
Tuesday.

454
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,600
Tuesday. Tuesday.

455
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,400
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday.

456
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,400
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday...

457
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,400
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
Tuesday, Tuesday...

458
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,200
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

459
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,500
<i>Tuesday, Tuesday...</i>

460
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,500
Say "Tuesday" again
and you ain't gonna see Wednesday!

461
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,700
I got it. I'll get it. Tuesday.

462
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,200
Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

463
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,900
-Buster. How you doing? You look great.
-Hey.

464
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,200
-Oh, thank you, man.
-Good to see you. Good to see you.

465
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,300
Thank you.
I thought you were gonna be at work.

466
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,600
Yeah, I'm on my way out now.

467
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,900
But hey, look,
there's cold beer in the refrigerator

468
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
and there's fresh sheets on the bed.
Go have a great dance lesson.

469
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,400
-all right.
-all right.

470
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,800
Power-tap.

471
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,700
Very good, very good.

472
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,100
Tuesday.

473
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,800
What's wrong with your boy?
He real cooI all of a sudden.

474
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,800
Yeah, I don't know what the hell got
into him, but I know I got dance fever.

475
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,300
Ready for a little power-tap, huh?

476
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,600
Lord, give me strength.

477
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,900
Hey, Sam, happy Tuesday.

478
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
Norbit.

479
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,400
Norbit.

480
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,400
-Hey, Kate. Hi.
-Come on, I got us a table.

481
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,200
Great. I've been looking forward to this
all week.

482
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,800
Good.

483
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,500
Hey.

484
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,200
Hey. Who's he?

485
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,400
Norbit, this is my fiancé, Deion Hughes.

486
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,500
How you doing, my man?
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

487
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,700
-This is your fiancé?
-Yes, sir.

488
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,600
I was just telling Deion that you and l
were buddy partners at the orphanage.

489
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Now she and I are buddy partners.

490
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,700
Shame on you, man,
letting a girI go like this. I feel for you.

491
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,300
And so Deion's got all this experience
in real estate,

492
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,300
so he's going to help me buy
the orphanage, Norbit. It's so exciting!

493
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,100
No, wait, wait. No, no.
Slow down, slow down.

494
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,900
I mean, you know,
we're just out here just scouting it out.

495
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,100
all right? This is her nest egg,
you know.

496
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,900
I don't want her
making any hasty decisions

497
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,800
that she might regret later, you know?

498
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,400
She worked too hard for this money,
man, you know what I mean?

499
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,000
Deion, you take
such good care of me, baby.

500
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,800
It's my job. Stop it.

501
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,900
Okay?

502
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,200
Don't you just love Tuesdays?

503
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Lloyd, just tell me why it has to hurt
so GD much.

504
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,400
What's the matter, boy?

505
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,500
You sensing an earthquake
or some other sort of naturaI disaster?

506
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,800
That's just my...

507
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,800
My wife.

508
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,200
A man needs his own space.

509
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,600
Finally! For the love of Cain.

510
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,000
Moses!

511
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,300
I'll see you suckers
tomorrow at the picnic!

512
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,400
Damn it, Norbit!
How many times I got to tell you,

513
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,900
don't be messing with my car seat!

514
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,800
Nobody touched your old, stupid seat.

515
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,300
Then how come
it's all mushed up like this, then?

516
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Well, you know, Rasputia,
you've been eating so much lately

517
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,100
there's a very strong possibility that...
The car is shrinking.

518
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Might be shrinking.
The car is being smaller.

519
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah, you might be right. Been raining
a lot lately. all this moist weather.

520
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,600
-Oh, yeah? That'll make it shrink.
-This weather's so moist.

521
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,700
How you doing?

522
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,400
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was hot like me</i>

523
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,300
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was a freak like me</i>

524
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,100
<i>Don't cha</i>

525
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,300
Look at that dog over there,
eyeballing me.

526
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,100
Rasputia, what are you doing?

527
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,400
Shut up!

528
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,700
-Hey, slow down! You're gonna hit him!
-I got you now. I got you now!

529
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,800
-Stop it! No!
-I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

530
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,000
Rasputia, don't! No! No! No!

531
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,900
I know what that sound means!

532
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,300
I know what that sound means!

533
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,700
Bark! How you doing!

534
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,000
Lloyd!

535
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,200
Enough is enough.

536
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,300
Now, where in the hell
do you think you're going?

537
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,300
Lloyd's in the hospitaI because of you!

538
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Yeah, that's right.
I put his little dog ass in the hospital.

539
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,100
And I'd have put it in the morgue, too,
if you didn't mess with my car seat.

540
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,600
It threw off my driving skilIs.

541
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:02,300
Rasputia, you are a mean, selfish, cold,
heartless woman, and I am leaving you!

542
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,500
-You leaving me?
-Yes!

543
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,000
Well, where the hell
you think you're going, big shot?

544
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,800
You ain't got no money.
You ain't got no family.

545
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,500
Everything is in my name, the car,
the house...

546
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,100
You ain't nothing and you ain't gonna
never be nothing without me, Norbit!

547
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,100
Norbit, you just can't leave!
Norbit, please, I'm with child!

548
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,200
With child?

549
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,800
Oh, yes, Norbit, can't you tell?
I'm getting a little belly.

550
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,800
And my titties is all achy and itchy-like.

551
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,300
Oh, Norbit, we gonna be a family.

552
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,100
Oh, Norbit, come hug me,
Daddy, please.

553
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,900
Please, Norbit.

554
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
I understand, little pony.

555
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,600
I know your pain.

556
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,900
Oh, yes, I know.

557
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Excuse me, snow bunny.

558
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,500
I don't come in your jurisdiction,
throwing town picnics.

559
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Yet here you is all up in mines,
pimping hos.

560
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,300
It's just a kissing booth.

561
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,100
Call it what you will,
but Pope Sweet Jesus

562
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,900
is taking half.

563
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,500
You work for me now, ho.

564
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Sure.

565
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,400
Let me taste the goods.

566
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,900
Put it on me.

567
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,900
-Greasy.
-Greasy.

568
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,900
We back in business.

569
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,300
I wanna be a ho. How do I apply?

570
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,600
Please, Lord Jesus, help me!
Look, look, tickets! Hey, tickets, tickets.

571
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,300
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Line up with your buddy.

572
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,600
Line up with your buddy.

573
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,100
-You got one, sweetie.
-Can we go on the jumper?

574
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Yeah, yeah, you go.

575
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,300
Baby, you know I love you.
I love these kids.

576
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
It's just that
I don't think buying an orphanage

577
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,600
is the right move financially right now.
That's all.

578
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Hey, this is not
a financiaI decision, Deion.

579
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,300
-I thought you understood that, baby.
-No. No, I do. I do, baby.

580
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,100
But this the call I was telling you...
The business call, it's very important.

581
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,100
Let's talk about it
when I get back to the house, okay?

582
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,400
You're not going to stay?

583
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,900
No, very important. Here.

584
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,000
Hello? It's never a bad time for you.

585
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Stop it! Stop!

586
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,000
Norbit!

587
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,200
-Hey.
-Hi.

588
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Hey.

589
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,700
-I didn't know you were gonna be here.
-Oh, yeah.

590
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,200
Hey, you know, I just saw Deion leaving.

591
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,600
He had some business to take care of.

592
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,700
So, who are you here with?

593
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,000
My wife.

594
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,000
-Norbit, I didn't know you were married.
-Yeah.

595
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,200
-Well, that's wonderful. Really.
-Thank you so much.

596
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,900
So, where is she?

597
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,100
Right over there in the print outfit.

598
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,200
The one talking to the girI by the bench?

599
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,000
No, the one sucking the jelly
out of them donuts.

600
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Oh, yeah. She's pretty.

601
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,900
That's cherry.
Is that cherry or strawberry?

602
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,500
What are my kids doing? Peter! Theo!

603
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,000
I don't want you bothering anyone.

604
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,800
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Rice.

605
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,100
Mrs. Rice?
My name ain't no damn Mrs. Rice.

606
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,600
Oh, I just thought
'cause you're married to Norbit...

607
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,900
Who the hell are you?

608
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Kate, this is my wife,
Rasputia Latimore,

609
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,500
and, Rasputia, this is Kate.

610
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,300
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

611
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,700
Kate's an old friend of mine
from the orphanage.

612
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,500
Latimore, as in Latimore Construction?

613
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,500
Yes, that's right,
as in Latimore Construction.

614
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,800
That's right. Why?

615
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,300
Well, just that this is perfect,

616
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,900
'cause I was going to come see
you guys about a renovation of...

617
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,600
I ain't come out here for that.

618
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm out here to enjoy these festivities,
not to be talking no business.

619
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,600
You wanna talk business,
my brother is Big Black Jack

620
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
over there by the BB guns.

621
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,500
Go over there and talk to him.
I ain't got no time for this.

622
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,400
Oh, sure, okay.

623
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,200
Well, go on, get.

624
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,100
-Okay.
-Okay.

625
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,100
-Come here.
-What, Rasputia?

626
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,700
You thinking about creeping, ain't you?

627
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,900
We're just friends.

628
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,700
What'd I tell you about having friends?

629
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,300
Go over there
and get me another wine cooler.

630
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,700
It's hot as hell out here.
Don't you see I'm sweItering?

631
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,400
-Rasputia, you can't drink wine.
-Why the hell not?

632
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,200
-You're with child.
-With child? I ain't with no...

633
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,300
Oh, that was... I had gas. I still got it.

634
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,500
There's your child.
Now, go get me something to drink.

635
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,300
Twins!

636
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,600
Hey! You come back here!

637
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,800
-Oh, my God!
-Move your fat ass, boy.

638
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,100
Look, you got one!

639
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,600
Get him. Get him, Big Black.

640
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
Are you Big Black Jack?

641
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,800
What it look like?

642
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,200
Oh, well.

643
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,500
Me and my fiancé
are buying the Golden Wonton...

644
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,900
Wong's place? He's selling it to you?

645
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,600
Yeah. Why is that surprising?

646
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,800
Miss Thomas, Miss Thomas, let's go.
They're starting the music.

647
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,400
-Oh, great!
-Come on. Let's go.

648
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,000
Can we finish this up later?
Apparently I have to go dance now.

649
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,600
all right, baby. You go dance now.

650
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,200
The orphanage is in play.

651
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,100
Y'all better give me my hat.
Give me the hat!

652
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,600
Here, take her hat.

653
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,400
You think I won't come up in here?
I'm gonna come up in here.

654
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
You think I'm playing?

655
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,500
Give me the hat right now,
or I'm gonna tear your leg off.

656
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,400
Hey, Norbit, come on!

657
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,400
Oh, no. No, I can't.
Rasputia's waiting for me.

658
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,900
-Come on, dance with us.
-No, really, I shouldn't...

659
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,600
Don't think I won't kilI a child.
I'll kilI a child in front of everybody.

660
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,600
Little street urchins.

661
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay. That's it.
Now it's time to bring the pain.

662
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,600
Dance, Norbit, dance! Come on!

663
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,500
My hat!

664
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,800
It's raining little white women.

665
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,800
My prayers have been answered!

666
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,000
She'd better move,
'cause my prayer is for a Cadillac.

667
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,500
You little bastards.

668
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,500
Where the hell is Norbit
with that wine cooler?

669
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,400
I'm thirsty as hell.

670
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,400
Oh, hell, no.

671
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,100
Oh, he's lost his mind.

672
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,200
Bitch, that's my wine cooler!

673
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,500
It's my birthday! It's my birthday!

674
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,800
It's your birthday?
You think it's your birthday, huh?

675
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,300
Norbit's got moves, everybody! Yeah!

676
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,800
You got him loose, don't you,
you little skinny bitch?

677
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,100
I see what you trying to do.
I see just what you trying to do.

678
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,000
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!
Come on, everybody!

679
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,100
Go, Norbit!

Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

681
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,100
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit!

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,900
Go, Norbit! Go, Norbit! Go...

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,100

00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,400
Hey, buddy partner.

690
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,400
Hi, Kate. Hi, nice to see you.
How you doing?

691
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,600
I'm good, but how about you
and your head?

692
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,400
Oh, I'm doing better.

693
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,000
The doctor said if it weren't for
my hard Afro, it could have killed me.

694
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,200
Are you sure you're okay, Norbit?
That sounds kind of fast.

695
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,600
Oh, well, they're doing some tests.
They're kind of monitoring me.

696
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,200
Well, I don't know about this stuff,
but 1 10 beats per minute,

697
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,200
that's kind of high. 120...

698
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,800
Oh, my goodness, 130!

699
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,300
Yeah, maybe the machine's broke.
I'm just gonna take these off.

700
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,700
You Deion Hughes?

701
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,200
Who's asking?

702
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,300
We the Latimores.

703
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,600
Yeah. Latimore Construction.

704
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,400
And we run this town.

705
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,800
Your woman was telling us how y'all
was planning on buying the orphanage.

706
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,700
Kate has her plans and I have mine.

707
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,200
Well, it looks like the only plans you got,
my man, is leaving.

708
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,100
I ain't sticking around
raising no damn orphans.

709
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,600
I got kids of my own
I ain't even bringing up.

710
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,400
So, you was just hustling her?

711
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,700
Break it to her gentle for me,
would you? I'm out!

712
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,800
Hold up, player.
I think you missing the flow here.

713
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,800
That orphanage she buying,
that's a huge property,

714
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,000
outside of town, zoned commercial.

715
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,600
Even got a liquor license.

716
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,100
lnteresting.

717
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,400
It's a perfect place for a titty bar.

718
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,100
-Did you say "titty bar"?
-Titties.

719
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,600
We got it all worked out.

720
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,300
We gonna call it Nipplopolis.

721
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,900
Nipplopolis.

722
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Shit got a ring to it, don't it?

723
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,500
We talking about overpriced,
watered-down alcohol

724
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,500
and fake tig old bitties in abundance.

725
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,300
Ain't gonna be nothing but tax-free,

726
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
under-the-table, pure cash money.
Big time!

727
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,400
That's right.

728
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,800
all you got to do is swing us the deal
and we make you partner.

729
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,200
And what about Kate?

730
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,800
lf you marry her,
it's as much yours as hers.

731
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,400
Norbit, I really want you
to be a part of the orphanage.

732
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,800
The kids are crazy about you.

733
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,900
-They're good kids.
-Yeah.

734
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,600
You know, I'm gonna take them
bike riding tomorrow, down by the lake.

735
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,600
Why don't you come?

736
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,800
I don't know if I could go for a bike ride.

737
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I never... I didn't really know how, the...

738
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,400
I can't ride a bike still.

739
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,300
You never learned? What?

740
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,500
Well, you left, you know,

741
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,100
and there was nobody
there to teach me.

742
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
And Wong don't ride.

743
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,700
Okay, we'll do something eIse.
The water park.

744
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,600
The kids have been begging me
to take them there.

745
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,400
Oh, I don't know about the water park.

746
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,700
Come on, it's a Saturday.
You don't have to work.

747
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,200
Yeah, I know, but it's the park
and it's watery,

748
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:21,000
and there's a potentiaI hell to pay
if I were to be there maybe...

749
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,500
Hey, what are you doing
with those things, Kate?

750
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,700
Well, I'm just going to have to shock you
tilI you say yes.

751
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,600
Hey, come on, Kate.
Don't play with those.

752
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,400
-Those things are plugged in. It's hot.
-Clear.

753
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,900
No, no clear. No clear. Stop, Kate.
Stop, Kate.

754
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,700
Come on. Yes.

755
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,100
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes! Okay, stop. Nurse!

756
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:57,500
Oh, my God, Deion. This is beautiful.
I didn't even know you could cook.

757
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,800
I just wanted to do something special
for you, you know, from the heart.

758
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,800
Well, I am feeling it.

759
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,800
Let's do it. Let's get married, right away.
I don't wanna wait.

760
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,000
-Deion.
-Church is free on Saturday.

761
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,800
You're serious?

762
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,000
-Baby, we belong together.
-Yeah.

763
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,300
-I want to. Saturday.
-Yeah. Yes!

764
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,200
-Thank you.
-Oh, no, thank you.

765
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,800
Norbit!

766
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,800
Hi. Hey. Good morning, Rasputia.

767
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,600
Good morning.
How are you this morning?

768
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,400
Where the hell you going?

769
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,600
Nowhere special.
I was just gonna go out to...

770
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,100
-I was just going over to Raging Waters.
-Raging Waters?

771
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,300
Yes. It's this thing
I got roped into, darling.

772
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,900
You know, I was at this orphanage
when I was raised, and...

773
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,100
And the people from the orphanage

774
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,200
and now they're taking other orphans
to Raging Waters

775
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,400
so they asked me to come
and give back to the community,

776
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,100
so I'm trying to, you know, do my part.

777
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,000
Little Miss Skinny Bitch gonna be there?

778
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,200
You mean Miss Ling Ling?

779
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,400
You know damn well
I ain't talking about no Miss Ling Ling.

780
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,800
I'm talking about Miss Thing Thing
from that picnic.

781
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,400
Miss Thing Thing from the picnic?

782
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,600
Who are you talking about, sweetheart?
I don't even...

783
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,000
Wait, I think I remember now.
A girl, she had the foreign name.

784
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,600
-Something Russian.
-Kate, bitch!

785
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,900
Kate! Of course it's Kate. Yes,
I don't know if Kate's gonna be there.

786
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,800
I hadn't even thought about it.
It didn't even cross my mind.

787
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:56,100
I wonder, wilI Kate be there?
Damn good question.

788
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,100
Well, I'm going.

789
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,400
No!

790
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:00,900
You don't like water parks,
Rasputia. No.

791
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,700
You don't like water parks,
Rasputia. No.

792
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,800
Who don't like water parks? I love them.
They're just like amusement parks,

793
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,100
except you ain't got to get off the ride
to go to the bathroom.

794
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,500
How you doing?

795
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,400
Great.

796
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,800
There you go. Have fun.

797
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,900
There you go, Brian.
Nick, there's one for you.

798
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,100
all right, kids, everybody please be nice
to Mrs. Latimore, okay?

799
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,600
-Okay.
-Okay.

800
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,800
Kate, I hope you don't mind.
I asked Rasputia to join us.

801
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,100
Of course not.
I'm really glad you could come.

802
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,000
Well, are we gonna stand around here
all day or we gonna go inside?

803
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,300
Excuse me.

804
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,000
Excuse me, ma'am.

805
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,900
What?

806
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,600
Are you wearing bottoms?

807
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,100
Of course I'm wearing bottoms!

808
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,400
Okay. Come on in.

809
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,500
How dare you?

810
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,100
Oh, hell, no.

811
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,900
How you doing!

812
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,400
This ain't like no real beach,

813
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,500
'cause on a real beach you got people
walking around with ice chests

814
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,000
and you can get all kinds of treats
like sandwiches and potato chips

815
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,800
and Mentos and Skittles
and all sorts of delectables.

816
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,600
You can't get shit here!

817
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,800
Well, you know,
there's a concession stand.

818
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,200
You going?

819
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,400
No, I already ate.

820
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,700
Well, you could have fooled me.

821
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,800
I'm sorry?

822
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm just trying to say
you too damn skinny. Look at you.

823
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,100
See, most men like a woman
that got a little... Or a little...

824
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,900
You ain't got nothing.
You just skin and bones,

825
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,400
just sitting in that chair
all bones and skin.

826
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,100
I feel sorry for you.

827
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,600
Well, I just feel that we're all made
exactly the way we're supposed to be.

828
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,100
Oh, no. Hell, no. I'm a Christian,

829
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,600
and you ain't gonna sit there
and blame God for how you look, okay?

830
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,600
You the one that
pushed that plate away.

831
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,900
My Norbit is always telling me
there's two kinds of women,

832
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,600
big old good ones
and good old big ones.

833
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,200
Really?

834
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,600
That's right. And, sister, let me tell you,
just between the two of us,

835
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,800
I can't keep Norbit off me.

836
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,700
He is the biggest freak
you ever wanna meet

837
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,300
and he be blowing my back out,

838
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,700
trying to put me
through the headboard every night.

839
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,400
I'm thinking about
going on a little diet or something

840
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,200
so I can get
all emaciated-looking like you,

841
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,600
then he'll think I look disgusting

842
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,700
and I can get a rest
or some sleep for a little while,

843
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,300
because he want it all the time.
Just boom, bam, boom, boom, boom.

844
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,800
But I ain't mad at him, hey.

845
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,800
I'm gonna go on a diet for sure,
next week.

846
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,600
Right now I'm gonna get me
a lamb kabob and a wine cooler.

847
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,900
How you doing?
Where is that wine cooler section?

848
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,400
Miss Thomas, we're all going off
the Leap of Doom. Come on.

849
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,900
Slowly. Slowly.
Someone's gonna fall down.

850
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,600
You're gonna break your head in half
in a second. Slow down!

851
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,000
Wait for me!

852
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,700
I tell you, it sure is tiring chasing these
kids all around the water park, isn't it?

853
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,100
Especially for us skinny folk.

854
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,700
What?

855
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,600
Never mind.

856
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,400
So, Norbit, I have some news.

857
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,100
Deion and l
decided to move up the wedding.

858
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,800
What wedding?

859
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,600
Our wedding.

860
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,600
We're going to get married on Saturday.

861
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,900
You're getting married on Saturday?

862
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,300
Yeah, we just figured, "Why wait?"
You know?

863
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,700
Well... Congratulations, then.

864
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,400
Thanks.

865
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,100
-Yeah.
-I'm really happy.

866
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,600
Oh, so am l. It's wonderful.

867
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,100
So, there it is, the Leap of Doom.

868
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,400
Yeah, go and have fun.
I'll wait for you at the bottom.

869
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,500
You go have some fun.

870
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,300
-Okay.
-Okay.

871
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,100
Okay, kids, one at a time.

872
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,700
I guess this is me.

873
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,500
What are you looking at, Norbit?

874
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:16,300
I was just watching the... Some kids.
They're about to come down the slide.

875
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,700
I wanted to watch
the kids come down safely.

876
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,600
-Kids, huh?
-Yeah.

877
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,500
So, you wanna watch a bitch
come down a slide?

878
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,000
Well, I'm gonna show you
how a bitch come down a slide.

879
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,700
Oh, no...

880
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,200
Excuse me, ma'am?
We have a 300-pound weight limit.

881
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,700
I don't weigh no damn 300 pounds.
I weigh 165. How you doing?

882
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,600
That was awesome.

883
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,100
What's that?

884
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,100
It's Rasputia.

885
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,000
I'm gonna show you
how a bitch go down a slide.

886
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,100
I'm sliding, bitches!

887
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,900
Mary, Mother of God.

888
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,200
Slow down! Stop! Stop!

889
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,300
How you doing?

890
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,700
Why does she have to go
and get married, Lloyd?

891
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,800
Things were going so well.

892
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,400
There it is.

893
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,100
Hey. Sorry about the concussion.

894
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,500
-It's okay.
-And the whiplash.

895
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,300
-It's okay.
-And the bruised stomach.

896
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,500
And the blood clot.

897
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,500
Nothing.

898
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,300
You know damn welI that's your baby.

899
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,500
You know it's yours. Got the same chin.
The same lip.

900
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,500
That baby got the same head as you
and the same eye...

901
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,900
Go take the test. Take the test.

902
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,600
<i>You want to hear the test resuIts?</i>

903
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,100
ln the case of the little baby...

904
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,300
<i>Well, the test says that is your baby.</i>

905
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,700
How you doing?

906
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,100
Latimore Construction, Norbit speaking.

907
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,800
<i>Hey, Norbit, it's Kate.</i>

908
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,300
<i>Is there any way you can meet me</i>
<i>in town right now?</i>

909
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,500
Yeah, sure.

910
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,000
<i>Great. I'm at McCormick's.</i>

911
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,700
Okay. Fine.

912
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,400
Rasputia, I'm just loaded up
with paperwork up to my ear.

913
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,700
I was wondering, could you run
these permits downtown for me?

914
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,000
Now you tell me
what in the hell I look like,

915
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,400
running some goddamn permits
down to City Hall for your ass.

916
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,600
You do it.

917
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:17,900
You do it.

918
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,900
Okay.

919
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,100
-What's the surprise?
-No, I'm not telling you.

920
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,900
TelI me. Hey, no, what are you doing?

921
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,700
-Not tilI the last second.
-What? What?

922
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,400
-You ready?
-Yeah, what is it?

923
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,900
I know you don't think
I'm gonna get on that thing.

924
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,300
-I think you're gonna get on that.
-Hey, no way. Hey.

925
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,100
Come on! Look where you wanna go.
You're doing great.

926
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,000
You got it? You got it? You got it?

927
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,200
Watch out for the fence!

928
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,600
And the mailbox.

929
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,300
Rasputia, the painters from
the Crestview site got food poisoning.

930
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,300
There's vomit everywhere!

931
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,200
You know damn well
you clean up all the vomit. You do it!

932
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,400
-I don't feel safe.
-Yeah! You're doing great!

933
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,700
Yeah.

934
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,500
The Portosans at Drummond's
tipped over!

935
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,500
Well, go clean the shit up!

936
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,500
Rasputia?

937
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,400
You do it!

938
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,500
-I got it!
-Go!

939
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,700
I'm getting it! I'm doing it!

940
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,200
You're doing it! Yeah, but slow down!

941
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,300
-How?
-With the brakes! The brakes!

942
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,300
Oh, no. Are you okay?

943
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,500
Yeah. Actually, that was kind of fun.

944
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,600
-Come on.
-Okay, help me.

945
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,800
-Okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

946
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,500
So, I'm going to Giovanni's tonight
to choose the food for the reception.

947
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,600
You wanna come? Help me decide?

948
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,500
What about Deion?

949
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,100
I just don't trust him with food.

950
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,600
You know,
he made dinner for us the other night.

951
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,900
It tasted like cheap take-out.

952
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,600
-Well, I'll go.
-Good.

953
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,600
Well, I just have to go get my dress,
and then we can meet, say, at 7:00?

954
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,000
Okay, that's great.

955
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,900
-Perfect, Norbit.
-Okay, see you at 7:00.

956
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,600
Norbit!

957
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,200
all right. Yeah, Norby.

958
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,300
7:00, don't be late.

959
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,200
You guys are all pervs.

960
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,800
I love it.

961
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,100
What's wrong?

962
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,700
Are you sure we're not rushing things?

963
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,000
I know we're not. I know we're not.
I couldn't be happier.

964
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,800
Norbit, that's a date.

965
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,200
No, it's not. She just wants someone...

966
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,100
Are you paying for this encounter
this evening?

967
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,200
Of course not!

968
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,100
Then that's a date.
Don't be trying to tell a pimp his game.

969
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,700
Come on, baby.

970
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,100
-Thank you.
-Carmen, honey!

971
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,700
all right.

972
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,200
Well, who are you getting all fine for?

973
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,200
Hello, Rasputia. Well, that's nice.

974
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,200
Oh, yeah, right.
Why you trying to look all extra today?

975
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,800
Oh, I'm just, you know, being a girl.

976
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,600
My fiancé likes it
when I take care of myself.

977
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,800
Look to me like
that fish already in his net.

978
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,100
You look like
you fixing to catch you a new fish.

979
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,100
What? No. God. Don't be silly.

980
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,200
You're married. You're here.

981
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,900
I don't do this for my husband.

982
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,700
Girl, I do this
because I have a reputation to uphold.

983
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,800
Everybody in this town know that
Rasputia Latimore is fine. Ain't I fine?

984
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,800
-You fine, girl! You are fine.
-Sister!

985
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,100
Everybody knows.

986
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,200
But even a delicate flower like me
need a little water from time to time.

987
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,600
Or a little lye in her kitchen
to help straighten out them petaIs.

988
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,000
How you doing?

989
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,300
Rasputia.

990
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400
Helga waiting on you, girl,
to do your bikini wax.

991
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,700
Here I come, girl.

992
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,100
I got to go, girl. Every now and then
I got to mow the lawn.

993
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,000
You just make sure
all that sprucing up is for your fiancé.

994
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,200
Helga, here I come, girl.
It's a fulI moon, too.

995
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,800
Here we go, dear.

996
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,400
I was looking for Norbit's police whistle.

997
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,800
Go fish.

998
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,600
What's up?

999
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,600
Everything on schedule
with the wedding?

1000
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,700
I got my own problems, but I'll handle it.

1001
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,500
What's this situation
you're talking about?

1002
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,600
The liquor license on the orphanage.

1003
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,600
It won't rolI over
when the property changes hands,

1004
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,000
not without one of
these transfer requests upfront.

1005
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,400
Yeah, and getting a new license
could take years.

1006
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,200
Yeah, we'd be out of business
before we get started.

1007
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,000
You think you can get Kate to sign that?

1008
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,800
Hell, no. She's planning on
closing the restaurant.

1009
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,500
It'd raise too many suspicions.

1010
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,800
all right, smart-ass,
then what we gonna do now?

1011
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,300
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1012
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,800
Norbit.

1013
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,500
-Where you going, Norbit?
-Sit your punk ass down.

1014
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,700
Guys, I told Rasputia
the toilet needed to be reinforced

1015
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,400
and she said
that I should take care of it,

1016
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,700
so I'm gonna go take care of that.

1017
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,900
Forget that.

1018
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,700
I can't. No, guys,
it's an accident waiting to happen.

1019
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,700
-I have to deaI with it.
-I said forget that.

1020
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,400
We need you to
get these papers signed tonight.

1021
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Oh, no. I can't do it tonight, guys.

1022
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,700
There's an accident waiting to happen.
I have to deaI with this...

1023
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,400
Norbit, if you don't
get these papers signed tonight,

1024
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,300
we can't start
the remodeI on the orphanage.

1025
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,400
That's right, punk ass.

1026
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,100
BulIshit. I'm going for mine tonight.
I got things to do!

1027
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,300
Norbit, you better find that Kate Thomas

1028
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,700
and get her to sign.

1029
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,000
Yeah.

1030
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,100
Kate Thomas?

1031
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,900
You want me to get these papers
to Kate Thomas?

1032
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,200
Yeah.

1033
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,600
Okay, that's more important.

1034
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,900
I'll take care of this for you guys.
I'll get these to Kate Thomas.

1035
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,600
-That's what I told you to do.
-Get your punk ass up.

1036
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,900
Okay, I'm gonna go take these to Kate

1037
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,100
and take my punk ass to Kate Thomas
right now.

1038
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,000
Excuse me, pardon me.
Let me get through here. Thank you.

1039
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,600
-Excuse me. Going through. Hi.
-Bitch ass.

1040
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,300
Yes, I am a bitch ass. Excuse me.
Kate Thomas.

1041
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,000
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1042
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,600
Man, it's time for
a pimpallcious makeover. Let's do this.

1043
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,200
all right. But nothing too flashy now.
I wanna be flashy, but not...

1044
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,300
Class. I don't want no....

1045
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,600
Now, that's pimping.

1046
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,200
all right, hair's bigger.

1047
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:19,700
Okay. Well, I guess this is it, guys.
Thanks a lot for all your help.

1048
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,600
Thanks for making me fly.

1049
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,900
You fly like a flock of birds, baby.

1050
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,600
-You look good.
-Thanks, guys.

1051
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,400
-Handle this business for us, brother.
-I'm gonna handle it. Gonna handle it.

1052
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,400
-Do the walk, Norbit.
-I got you.

1053
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,500
Yeah. Norbit!

1054
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,300
Wow, Norbit!

1055
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,100
I just picked these
on the side of the road,

1056
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,800
'cause this is just a casuaI get-together.

1057
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,900
Sure. And you put the wires
up the stems, too. That's a nice touch.

1058
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,600
-Norbit!
-Hey, Sam.

1059
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,300
You dressed to kill, huh?

1060
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,400
Katerina, you look beautiful.
Come sit, please.

1061
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,700
I'm making my speciaIty just for you.

1062
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,000
Hey. Did you make my favorite?

1063
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,900
What do you think, huh?

1064
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,800
I'm gonna take the flowers,
put them into water, okay?

1065
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,900
He's a nice man.

1066
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,300
Your favorite?

1067
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,800
I guess you and Rasputia
come here a lot, huh?

1068
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,600
Oh, no. We used to,
but she got banned for life

1069
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,700
because Sam had
an all-you-can-eat buffet once

1070
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,800
and she took it as a personaI challenge,
and it got pretty ugly.

1071
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,500
I wanna make a toast.

1072
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,900
Oh, sure.

1073
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,600
To old friends.

1074
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,700
To old friends.

1075
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,000
We were buddy partners, all right,
Norbit. We were.

1076
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,000
I tell you, you know,

1077
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:01,400
sometimes I think
I should've never married Rasputia.

1078
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,700
What do you mean, Norbit?

1079
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,000
I was just really young, you know,
and she latched on to me

1080
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:11,400
and kind of helped me fit in
and gave me a family, so...

1081
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,000
We had nobody, Norbit.

1082
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,600
I mean, who can blame us
for wanting to feel safe, you know?

1083
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,600
Yeah, safe.

1084
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,900
Like you and Deion?

1085
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,500
Yeah.

1086
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,400
I mean,
it's different with Deion, obviously.

1087
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,600
So, what have you got here?

1088
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,400
Those are just construction papers,

1089
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,000
permits and stuff that you have to sign.

1090
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,700
Kate, can I ask you
a personaI question?

1091
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,400
Sure, what?

1092
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,800
Do you love Deion?

1093
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,800
Of course. Yeah.

1094
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,800
Otherwise,
why would I be marrying him, right?

1095
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,700
Right?

1096
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,200
-Got your pizza.
-It is about time.

1097
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,600
I'm about to disappear up in here
I'm so hungry.

1098
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,600
Norbit out draining a swamp
or something.

1099
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:27,900
Yeah, he's definitely draining a swamp.
He's draining a swamp like he would be.

1100
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,500
-Why you looking at me like that?
-Where's Norbit?

1101
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:39,800
Draining a swamp.
And why are you looking at me like that?

1102
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,500
He's out there in the woods,
draining a swamp. I told you before.

1103
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,600
I don't know nothing.

1104
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,200
I don't know nothing, okay?

1105
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,700
He's on a date with that fine skinny girl!

1106
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,600
It's pain time here! I ain't having this!

1107
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,600
Oh, hell, no. And on top of that
he been messing with my seat again?

1108
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,300
Damn it, Norbit!

1109
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,800
He got me destroying my shit.

1110
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,500
This is it.

1111
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,700
It's always so beautifuI in here.

1112
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,800
Peaceful.

1113
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,300
-Hello, Kate, Norbit.
-Hey.

1114
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,800
Didn't know anybody was here.
I was getting ready to close up shop.

1115
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,700
You know, Kate,
this all happened so fast,

1116
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,000
I reallzed we never had
a chance to rehearse.

1117
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,900
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1118
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,100
So, come on up here.

1119
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,600
Let me at least show you
where you're gonna stand.

1120
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,300
-Come on.
-all right.

1121
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,500
Rasputia. You know
you no allowed in here.

1122
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,800
The hell with that. Where's Norbit?

1123
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,200
I don't see Norbit.
Anybody is a see Norbit?

1124
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,700
-No.
-He hasn't been here.

1125
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:21,600
Then who was eating a turkey ass?

1126
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,200
Run! Run! Run!

1127
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,600
At which point
you'll give your vows to Deion.

1128
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,600
You want to practice those?

1129
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:37,600
Well, I hadn't actually gotten to that
quite yet.

1130
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,000
You don't even know
what you're gonna say yet?

1131
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,100
Well, what would you say, Norbit?
I don't know.

1132
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,000
What would I say?

1133
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,400
Norbit!

1134
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,800
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was hot like me</i>

1135
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,000
<i>Don't cha wish your girlfriend</i>
<i>was a freak like me</i>

1136
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,000
<i>Don't cha</i>

1137
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,000
What would I say if I was saying vows?

1138
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,000
I guess...

1139
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,200
Kate,

1140
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,800
I think about you all day long.

1141
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:19,400
And when I'm not near you,

1142
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,400
all I think about is being near you.

1143
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,200
And when you are near me,

1144
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:27,000
I feel like I'm at peace
with the whole world.

1145
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,100
I know that...

1146
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,600
I know I'll never have to
ask God for anything

1147
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,000
'cause, as long as I have you in my life,

1148
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:40,500
I got everything I ever wanted.

1149
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,700
And the only thing
I really wanna do is just

1150
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:51,600
spend the rest of my life making you
as happy as you've made me.

1151
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,500
Because I love you, Kate.

1152
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,400
I love you.

1153
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,800
I don't know. Something like that.

1154
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:07,000
And after the vows you would then...

1155
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Okay.

1156
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,100
Oh, my God.

1157
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,900
I'm sorry, I have to go.

1158
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,000
I'm sorry.

1159
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,800
-Awkward.
-Yeah.

1160
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,800
Give me that crowbar.
I got some killing to do.

1161
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,900
Damn it!

1162
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,300
I'm a Christian. You got me
up in this church cursing, Norbit.

1163
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,800
Death do us part, huh? Okay, Norbit.

1164
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,000
Look like you done moved up
the goddamn schedule.

1165
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,700
I'm cursing again.

1166
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:36,900
Pray, bitch, pray.

1167
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,700
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1168
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,300
Thy kingdom come, thy wilI be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1169
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,900
Kate, please. Kate, please, I'm sorry.

1170
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,200
Kate, please, stop and talk to me.

1171
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,200
Please, please, Kate.
Talk to me, please.

1172
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,100
I can't, Norbit.

1173
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,200
I'm just too confused right now.

1174
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,800
I'm sorry. It was all my fauIt.
I never should have kissed you.

1175
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,900
No.

1176
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,400
I wanted you to.

1177
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,200
That's why I'm so confused.

1178
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,200
Good night.

1179
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,100
She wanted me to.

1180
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:37,400
-Where the papers at, Norbit?
-Got them for you right here.

1181
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,200
I'd hate to be you right now.

1182
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,700
Why?

1183
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,600
Go on in the house.

1184
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,600
Go on in.

1185
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,600
Go ahead, fool. What you waiting for?

1186
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,300
Get on in.

1187
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,200
Hello?

1188
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,100
Chocolate drop, I'm home.

1189
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,900
Lollipop?

1190
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,000
Mail.

1191
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,500
Expecting a letter, Norbit?

1192
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,300
You frightened me.
No, I was just looking through.

1193
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,700
How was your date?

1194
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,500
Date?

1195
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:49,100
That was no date. That was just...

1196
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:53,800
I just was over at
what's-her-name's wedding rehearsal.

1197
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,500
That's all. It wasn't a date, though.

1198
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,300
Oh, really?

1199
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,800
Lloyd. Is that you, Lloyd?

1200
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,000
Lloyd, what am I gonna do?

1201
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,200
KilI the bitch.

1202
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,600
Excuse me? What'd you say?

1203
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:35,400
You heard me. Rub her out.
Take her down. lce the bitch.

1204
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,300
Hey. Lloyd, you're talking.

1205
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:43,100
She took my legs, Norbit.
She took my legs.

1206
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,200
You know what it's like to be a dog
with no legs?

1207
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,100
I can't raise one up to pee.

1208
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:53,100
Hell, I can't even hump no more, Norbit.
Humping was my thing.

1209
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,400
What is this, Norbit?

1210
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,700
Some kind of weird, satanic potato art?

1211
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,700
What's this?

1212
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,400
It looks like the acid
that we use down at the quarry.

1213
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,600
Right!

1214
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:11,400
But this is
Miss Pretty Little Thang's little face.

1215
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,700
And, Norbit, if you ever see her again,
if you ever talk to her again,

1216
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,100
if you ever so much
as think about the bitch again,

1217
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,800
this is what's gonna happen to her.

1218
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,500
How you doing?

1219
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,600
You get the picture, Norbit?

1220
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,400
Deion, I just think that
we need to take a beat.

1221
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,700
It's not you, it's me.

1222
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,500
Just if we slow down, l...

1223
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,500
Oh, good, you're up.

1224
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,400
-Deion, we need to talk.
-Yes, we do.

1225
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,500
I was just at Latimore Construction,
you know, with the renovation plans,

1226
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,100
and I found this on Big Black's desk.

1227
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,700
What is it?

1228
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,200
It's a request to renew
the Golden Wonton's liquor license

1229
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,900
and put it in the Latimores' name.

1230
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,700
What?

1231
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,300
Baby, you signed it yesterday.
Look at the date.

1232
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,800
No. No, I didn't sign anything.

1233
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,400
Just some permits
that Norbit gave me, but...

1234
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,700
Well, did you read them?

1235
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,700
-No.
-No. Great.

1236
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,200
I don't get it, though, Deion.

1237
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,400
Why would the Latimores
want me to renew the liquor license

1238
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,700
at the orphanage?

1239
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,500
Baby, people say
they've been trying to get their hands on

1240
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,900
that orphanage for years.

1241
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,900
Apparently they want to turn it
into a strip joint.

1242
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,400
Disgusting.

1243
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,600
First you gonna clean the basement,
then you gonna clean the garage,

1244
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,700
then you gonna go upstairs
and clean the attic.

1245
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,900
We don't even have an attic.

1246
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:40,600
Well, then you build a damn attic, then,
Norbit! And then clean it!

1247
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,600
I'm going upstairs to take a bubble bath.

1248
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,600
Bitch! You bitch!

1249
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,500
Finally.

1250
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,900
I needed this.
Let me submerge this ass.

1251
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,900
How you doing?

1252
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,800
Good and hot.

1253
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,800
Sounds like it's raining outside.

1254
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,600
Oh, no.

1255
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,600
Kate!

1256
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,700
Norbit.

1257
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,000
Over here. Over here.

1258
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,700
I need to talk to you.

1259
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,000
Do you know what was in those papers
you had me sign last night?

1260
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,000
Yeah, the construction permits.

1261
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,200
No, that's not all.

1262
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,100
Norbit.

1263
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,000
Hey, just... Just go away, Kate!
Get out of here!

1264
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,300
What?

1265
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,100
You heard what I said!
Just get out of here! Scram!

1266
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,900
The Latimores are trying to
take controI of the orphanage, Norbit.

1267
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,100
Well, why don't you go and find
somebody who gives a rat's ass,

1268
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,800
because I sure as hell don't!

1269
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,400
-You don't care?
-No, I don't care.

1270
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,900
-And I don't care about you, either!
-Norbit.

1271
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,700
The only woman I have ever,
ever loved and ever cared about

1272
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,300
was my darling wife, Rasputia!

1273
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,600
But last night...

1274
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:26,200
Last night I was just trying to naiI you,
you know, score?

1275
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,900
But now I reallze I don't have to do that!

1276
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,500
all I need is my beautiful,
precious wife Rasputia!

1277
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:39,900
She's all the woman I need, so
you can just go on and get out of here,

1278
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,500
you screwy dame! Who needs you?

1279
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,400
Damn, Norbit.

1280
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,700
Did that skinny little thing
figure out your plan?

1281
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,400
Girl, you just don't get it, do you?
Norbit played you.

1282
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,800
You got her to sign those papers,
didn't you?

1283
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,600
Yes, darling.

1284
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,200
He been setting you up
from that moment

1285
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,400
from the very first day you got here.

1286
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,900
How you doing?

1287
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:06,700
Don't you ever talk to me again!

1288
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,200
Kate.

1289
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,000
Damn, Norbit,
you pissing off everybody today.

1290
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:17,300
Don't you ever talk to me again!
Don't you ever talk to me again!

1291
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,000
Never again!

1292
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,700
Hey, Norbit.

1293
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,500
Mr. Wong,
what are you doing around here?

1294
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,300
I just going for a walk, Norbit.
Just going for a walk.

1295
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:06,100
I live in this neighborhood long time.
Long time.

1296
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,100
Soon I be moving on.

1297
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,700
Yes, as I look around this neighborhood,

1298
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,300
I reallze there
no good dry cleaners here.

1299
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,100
I could make killing.

1300
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,600
Why you got suitcase?

1301
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,800
I'm getting the H out of here.
I'm leaving town for good.

1302
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,000
What? Leaving town?

1303
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,400
I thought you stick around,
help Kate run orphanage.

1304
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,500
She's getting married
to Deion tomorrow,

1305
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,100
so there's no reason
for me to stay around here.

1306
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,700
No reason?

1307
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,500
No, she won't even see me.

1308
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,000
And besides,
I'll just wind up getting hurt again.

1309
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:40,400
Norbit, you listen to me.
You very speciaI to me.

1310
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:45,400
I love you like my own child,
like boy child, not girI child.

1311
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,800
Wong once have girI child
back in Shanghai.

1312
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,500
When she two years old,
I trade her for yak.

1313
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,100
That sort of thing happen in China
from time to time.

1314
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,900
Yak very hard to come by.

1315
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,700
Oh, yeah, sure. I appreciate that.

1316
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,700
You can't run
from your problems, Norbit.

1317
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,800
Black people run fast,
but problem even faster.

1318
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,000
That's kind of racist.

1319
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:11,200
Yes. Wong very racist. I no like black.
I no like Jew either.

1320
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:14,100
But black and Jew love Chinese food.
Go figure.

1321
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,400
Always remember two things, Norbit.

1322
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:22,000
One, even though you're very ugly,

1323
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,900
you're very strong inside, like warrior.

1324
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,300
And two, maiI come late on Friday.

1325
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,300
Wong Dry Cleaning.

1326
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,900
It could have been huge.

1327
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,700
You don't even have to clean nothing,
you just spray with starch.

1328
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,200
Mr...

1329
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,200
I gotta warn Kate.

1330
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:17,900
<i>Hello?</i>

1331
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,100
Hello, Kate. Kate, it's Norbit.
I have to talk to you.

1332
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,600
<i>-Please don't call me anymore.</i>
-No, Kate, it's very important.

1333
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,500
Kate?

1334
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,900
Going somewhere, Norbit?

1335
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,300
No, I was... No.

1336
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,100
What did I tell you
about leaving this house?

1337
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,700
I was just going to get some fresh air.

1338
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,300
Boy, you ain't going nowhere
tilI after that wedding's done.

1339
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,100
We got too much riding on that.

1340
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
What do you have
riding on the wedding?

1341
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,500
Soon as your little friend says, "I do,"

1342
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,800
Deion and us is gonna
turn the orphanage into a titty bar.

1343
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,400
But what about the little orphans?

1344
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,600
Hell, they can come too,
if they pay the cover.

1345
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,600
John the Baptist, stop their eviI plan.

1346
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,500
Get your ass down in the basement.

1347
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,500
Get down there!

1348
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:26,200
It's a madhouse! A madhouse!

1349
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,000
-Come on, Rasputia! We gonna be late.
-Yeah.

1350
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,000
I know y'all better stop rushing me.

1351
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:49,600
Beauty takes time.
This don't just happen.

1352
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:50,900
Oh, no.

1353
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,200
You get out the car.

1354
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:52,700
You gonna stay here
and make sure Norbit don't go no place.

1355
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,100
You gonna stay here
and make sure Norbit don't go no place.

1356
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,700
What? Why I gotta stay?

1357
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,300
Because everybody know
you the smartest.

1358
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,800
Three minutes to show time.
Not too late to chicken out.

1359
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,300
No, I'm ready.

1360
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,900
Okay. You look beautiful.

1361
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,800
<i>P-O-W-E-R.</i>

1362
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:50,100
<i>T to the A to the mother-stanking P.</i>
<i>Power-tap the fat, move back.</i>

1363
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,000
<i>Power-tap the fat, move back.</i>

1364
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,000
What are the Latimores doing here?

1365
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,400
Don't worry. It's your day.
You look beautiful.

1366
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,200
Nuts.

1367
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:30,300
<i>-Tap, tap, tap. Tap it off.</i>
-Tap, tap. Tap...

1368
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,300
Norbit!

1369
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,700
Norbit? Norbit?

1370
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,600
Oh, damn. He escaped.

1371
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,200
Norbit! Norbit!

1372
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,300
Your ass is mine, Norbit!

1373
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,200
Yeah.

1374
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,800
-Just now? Shit.
-Is he all right?

1375
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,400
Norbit escaped. He gonna be
headed this way. Come on.

1376
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,000
Hell, no.

1377
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,200
-Norbit is coming.
-For shizzle?

1378
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,500
We have to figure out way
to stall wedding.

1379
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,900
Just calm down, Mr. Wong.

1380
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,200
I've ruined plenty of weddings
back in the day. I got this.

1381
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,700
Dearly beloved,

1382
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,900
we are gathered here today
to join these two in holy matrimony.

1383
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,700
Your Honor, I object!

1384
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,800
Object? Sir, we've not gotten to
that part yet.

1385
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,800
Then I'm objeculating prematurely,
Reverend.

1386
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,700
No offense, my brother, but we're just
trying to keep the train rolling here.

1387
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,200
Oh, well, if you want to
get the train rolling, you know...

1388
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,400
You got to use the big "L".

1389
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,800
Lesbians.

1390
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,100
No, man.
I ain't talking about no lesbians.

1391
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,700
-AIthough, late at night.
-Yes.

1392
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,400
-Right?
-Yes.

1393
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,500
-No, brother, we talking about love.
-Love.

1394
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:06,200
Love is the engine
that drives the train forward, backwards,

1395
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:11,100
side to side,
round and round love does go.

1396
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,700
You understand me? I got this, brother.

1397
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:18,300
I'm not talking about no $20 up in here,
back seat of the car,

1398
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,400
stanky-stanky, hanky-panky.

1399
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,400
-No.
-No.

1400
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,900
I'm talking about good, wholesome,

1401
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
fortified with
eight essentiaI vitamins love.

1402
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:28,600
That cost anywhere...

1403
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,700
How much it cost?

1404
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,800
About $136, Monday through Fridays.
$212 on the weekends.

1405
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,800
Because of inflation.
Can I get an "Amen"?

1406
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,000
Amen!

1407
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,200
Where the hell you going, Norbit?

1408
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:53,300
None of your GD beeswax, Rasputia!

1409
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,400
Look at you, you old stupid fool.
You can't even ride a bike.

1410
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,500
Oh, yes, I can, because Kate taught me!

1411
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:12,200
Brothers and sisters.
This particular one's for the brothers.

1412
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:16,000
When you buy the ones that say,
"Ribbed for her pleasure,"

1413
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:20,700
turn them inside out
and they ribbed for your pleasure.

1414
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,000
-Can I get an "Amen"?
-Amen!

1415
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,600
Now, speaking of ribs and pleasure.

1416
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:30,500
Yes. For a limited time only,
we are proud to present to you

1417
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,800
our barbeque, baby back, horseradish,

1418
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,900
mustard and
peanut butter-encrusted ribs

1419
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,700
with a slight Jagermeister infusion
sprinkled with chamomile leaves

1420
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,500
with a horseradish
and dandelion salad on a bed of rice.

1421
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,700
Buy one Pimp Platter,
get the whole bones free.

1422
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,800
No, no, no! That's enough talking.

1423
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,900
It's time to get back to the wedding.

1424
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,600
It ain't never enough talking
when you talking about love, brother.

1425
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:01,900
-Ain't that right?
-Yeah!

1426
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,600
Let me hear you say it, people!

1427
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:04,700
Love!

1428
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,800
Let me hear you sing it, choir!

1429
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,000
<i>Love!</i>

1430
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,100
-I'm gonna rip your head off.
-Rasputia.

1431
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,600
-What?
-Car!

1432
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,400
I don't give a damn about no car.
I'm ready to die.

1433
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,900
Car!

1434
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,900
I'm ready to die!

1435
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:34,400
I'm ready to die.

1436
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,300
I ain't gonna let you ruin Nipplopolis
for me, boy! Damn!

1437
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,400
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die up in here.

1438
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:41,500
Drive the car, God damn it!

1439
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,700
What's up, white man?
Pay for your sins. Pay for your sins.

1440
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,300
We gonna change your name to Leroy.

1441
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,700
Amen!

1442
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,200
That's enough!

1443
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,600
That's enough! Enough! Enough!
Enough! Enough!

1444
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,600
-Stop the music!
-Hold on.

1445
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,100
Shut up! You two, shut up!

1446
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,100
That's it. This is husband-and-wife time.

1447
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,800
Now, let's go. Let's go.
Husband-and-wife stuff.

1448
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:14,900
Dearly beloved,

1449
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,100
we are gathered here today...

1450
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,500
I object!

1451
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,000
Oh, for Christ's sake!

1452
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,900
-Norbit.
-Norbit.

1453
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Norbit.

1454
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,900
<i>Norbit</i>

1455
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:29,400
This wedding is a sham
and I'm here to stop it.

1456
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,400
Norbit, what are you doing?

1457
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,200
I'm being a man
for the first time in my life. Kate...

1458
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Kate, I love you.

1459
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,900
What the hell did you just say?

1460
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:46,000
You heard what I said, strumpet.
I love Kate!

1461
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:48,400
That's right. I love you, Kate.

1462
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:51,900
And the last two weeks I spent with you
have meant more to me

1463
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,800
than my whole entire miserable life
with you, Rasputia!

1464
01:29:54,900 --> 01:30:00,000
It's over! Norbit Albert Rice
is no longer your bitch!

1465
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,500
You're dead! Get off me!

1466
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,200
Get your hands off me, Black.
Don't go hitting me.

1467
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,500
What's wrong with you, girl?
What's wrong with you? Get off of me.

1468
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,800
You don't talk like that with me.

1469
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:12,900
No, wait!

1470
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,200
No, no, wait, baby girl,
he's ruining our wedding.

1471
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,600
Let's just get back to the nuptiaIs.

1472
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:18,400
We just heard condom advice
from an ex-pimp.

1473
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:21,100
I think we can survive
a few words from Norbit.

1474
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:24,200
Deion is a fake. He's marrying you
just to get your money.

1475
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,300
What?

1476
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,500
Him and the Latimores.
They thought this whole scheme up.

1477
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,800
He's been married four times in the
last six years to four different women,

1478
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:34,900
and he cheated the women
out of $300,000 in divorce settlements.

1479
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,800
Yeah, I heard all about it!
And something eIse.

1480
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,100
They were gonna try to steal
the orphanage from you.

1481
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,400
That's what this whole thing is about!

1482
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,700
You crazy! He's got a big crush on you.
He's making this stuff up.

1483
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,600
Oh, yeah? I'm crazy?
I'm making it all up?

1484
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,900
-Yes, you making it up.
-Then what about this, then?

1485
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,800
This evidence that I have.
Look at this!

1486
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,100
This, well...

1487
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:57,900
This used to, before it felI in the pond,
it had numbers

1488
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,500
and there was information.

1489
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,700
There was people's names
and dates and addresses

1490
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,400
and all kinds of incriminating things.

1491
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:09,800
I felI in the pond, but you can't read it.
But, boy, did I have your ass!

1492
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,400
That's nice, Norbit. Really nice.
Did you write that yourself? Pathetic.

1493
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,000
Kate, you have to believe me.

1494
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,400
Yeah, yeah, believe him, Kate.

1495
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,900
Remember the one that got you to sign
the papers to steaI the orphanage?

1496
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,200
Remember that?
Believe him. Go ahead.

1497
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:26,200
I'm so sorry, Norbit.
I just don't trust you anymore.

1498
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:34,300
Well, well, well, Norbit. You lose again.

1499
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:38,300
Once a loser, always a loser, huh?
Now, come on! Let's go!

1500
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,500
Yeah, I thought you'd feel
that way about it, Kate.

1501
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
And that's why I took the liberty

1502
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:50,700
of inviting some of
Deion's ex-wives down

1503
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,100
so maybe they could tell you
for themselves.

1504
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,900
Ladies!

1505
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,500
Hello, Antoine.

1506
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,600
-I've been looking for you.
-Daddy!

1507
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:02,200
Antoine? He told me
his name was Luther!

1508
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,300
Who is that ho?

1509
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,000
He told me he was gay.

1510
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:09,100
No, no, no. Y'all got me confused with
my gay twin brother, Antoine Luther.

1511
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,700
-You dead, gold digger!
-Get your butt back here!

1512
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,900
I'm out!

1513
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Looks like the wedding's off, bro.

1514
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,500
Church!

1515
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,900
-God damn it, Norbit!
-Oh, snap!

1516
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,900
Get him!

1517
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,200
Norbit!

1518
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:27,100
Mother Mary! Jesus! Noah! Christ!

1519
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,300
Good.

1520
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,300
You going somewhere, Norbit?

1521
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
-You messed up, boy.
-That's right.

1522
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,500
Now you gonna pay. Big time!

1523
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,000
Latimore! Keep your fakakta hands
off him!

1524
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:09,600
Go back to your shop, Abe,
before I kilI you, too!

1525
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:12,900
Hey! You gonna have to kilI me, as well!

1526
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,800
Yeah, and me, too!

1527
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,200
Rasputia!

1528
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,800
How you doing?

1529
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,700
I kick the shit out of you.

1530
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,300
Mind your goddamn business.

1531
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,900
Mind your business. Get out of here.
Move it.

1532
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,700
No, you didn't!

1533
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,700
Bye-bye.

1534
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,500
Bring it, bitches!

1535
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:55,500
Oh, hell to the no.

Get out of the way.

1539
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,600
His ass is mine.

1540
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,200
'Sputia? Rasputia?

1541
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,400
You remember "tilI death do us part,"
don't you, Norbit?

1542
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,600
No!

1543
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,300
Whale, ho!

1544
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:30,500
Did somebody just call me a whale?

1545
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,800
Yeah, and a ho!

1546
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,600

01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,300
<i>ln the end, I guess you could say</i>
<i>everything worked out just fine.</i>

1557
