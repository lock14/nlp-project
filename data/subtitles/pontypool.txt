1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,418
Mrs. Frenchie's cat is missing.

2
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:38,212
The signs are posted
all over town:

3
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:41,676
"Have you seen Honey?"
We've all seen the posters...

4
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:44,094
but nobody has seen "Honey"
the cat.

5
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:45,512
Nobody...

6
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,929
<i>until last Thursday morning...</i>

7
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:50,932
when Ms. Colette Piscine
swerved her car to miss Honey...

8
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:53,600
while she drove across the bridge.

9
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:55,936
Well, this bridge,
now slightly damaged,

10
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:57,603
is a bit of a local treasure.

11
00:00:57,603 --> 00:01:00,356
and even has
its own fancy name:

12
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:02,775
'Pont de flaque'

13
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:08,114
Now, 'Colette'...
that sounds like 'culotte'...

14
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,573
That's 'panty' in French.

15
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:12,159
And 'Piscine' means "Pool"...

16
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,117
"Panty Pool"

17
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,412
'Flaque' also means pool in French.

18
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:20,248
So, Colette Piscine,
in french 'Panty Pool',

19
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,210
drives across the 'Pont de flaque'...

20
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,418
or 'Pont de Pool',
if you will...

21
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:25,337
to avoid hitting
Mrs. French's cat...

22
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:27,504
that's been missing in Pontypool.

23
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:32,926
Pontypool... Pont de Pool...
Panty Pool... Pont de flaque...

24
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,677
What does it mean?

25
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,473
Well, Norman Mailer,
he had an interesting theory...

26
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,099
that he used to explain the...

27
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,727
strange coincidences
in the aftermath...

28
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,853
of the JFK assassination:

29
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:46,771
In the wake of huge events,

30
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,314
after them and before them,

31
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:51,150
physical details -
they spasm for a moment.

32
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,276
They sort of unlock,

33
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:54,152
and when they come back into focus,

34
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:57,865
they suddenly coincide
in a weird way:

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,075
street names and birth dates
and middle names...

36
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:03,870
all kinds of superfluous things
appear related to each other.

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,579
It's a 'ripple effect'

38
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,373
So, what does it mean?

39
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:12,418
Well, it means something's
going to happen...

40
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,378
Something big...

41
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,757
But then,
something's always...

42
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:19,091
about to happen.

43
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,146
No, no, nothing has got to do with you.

44
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:35,397
You gotta be the worst fucking agent
in the world!

45
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:40,067
Come on!
It's not enough to say "I'm working".

46
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:42,735
It's not enough, do you understand?

47
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:47,783
Well, if you think it is enough, then
maybe we're not thinking the same way?

48
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:48,824
You know what I mean?

49
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:57,792
You know what, Rick?

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,461
You're fired! You're fired!

51
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:05,713
Good.

52
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:08,967
Now we're both in the same boat...

53
00:03:15,473 --> 00:03:17,974
Oh, Jesus...

54
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,576
What?

55
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:43,871
Hey!

56
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:44,872
Hey...

57
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:45,873
Hey!

58
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:47,334
Hey...

59
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,668
Who are you?

60
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:50,795
Who are you...
Who are you...

61
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:53,715
Who are you...
Who are you...

62
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:59,521
Okay Mazzy,
come on boy, please.

63
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:01,689
Be positive.

64
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:07,860
Morning Mr. Mazzy.

65
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,947
Good morning, Laurel Ann.

66
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:14,783
I loved your 'Isn't It Ironic?'
this morning.

67
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:16,244
Love Norman Mailer.

68
00:05:16,244 --> 00:05:17,452
Thanks.

69
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,831
You know, it takes a girl with
big feet to dig old Norm'.

70
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,084
So, did you give me the good stuff?

71
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,886
Let's make radio!

72
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:39,680
Laurel Ann, do me a favor...

73
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,557
Look up all the information you can
on 911 calls.

74
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:45,893
How many in a 24h period,
how many hang-ups...

75
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:47,060
That sort of thing...

76
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:48,853
and... thanks.

77
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:51,939
Let's make radio!

78
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,855
Good morning, Pontypool.

79
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,814
This is Radio 660, the beacon.

80
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:44,692
Down here in the dungeon,
under the street they call 'Drum'.

81
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:47,028
I'll be...

82
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:49,656
banging the drum for you
all morning.

83
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,533
I'm Grant Mazzy
and as always...

84
00:06:52,533 --> 00:07:00,624
I'll be takin' no prisoners.
Now... mmm... I got my coffee here.

85
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:02,415
and taking a look outside...

86
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:06,838
I'd say... that's our
top story for today, folks.

87
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:12,216
Now, I had a... a strange experience
on my way in to work this morning.

88
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:16,052
And I'd like to get some advise
from you people later on.

89
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,641
When do you call 911?
Think about it!

90
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,935
I should mention,
our producer,

91
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:27,271
the lovely and talented
Ms. Sydney Briar, is here.

92
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,939
And 'lucky' Laurel Ann Drummond...

93
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,317
she'll be our technical cowgirl today.

94
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:36,946
Now, I didn't know this, maybe you did...
but, uh... this is news to me...

95
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:42,283
Laurel Ann did a tour of duty
in Afghanistan not too, too long ago...

96
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:45,245
You're right, there, new guy.
Everybody does know.

97
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,831
She was a "Grand Master"
at last year's Fall Fair.

98
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,917
- Yesterday's news.
- Hey.

99
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,293
I'm... sorry Laurel Ann.

100
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:54,670
I wasn't the "Grand Master",
I was the "Homecoming Hero"

101
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,379
I am sorry, I... okay?
I'm very bad.

102
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:00,591
Oooh, Sydney, Sydney, Sydney!
Hey, come on, girl!

103
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,468
- I'm sorry!
- It's okay.

104
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:05,137
Well, you just heard an honorary
apology from Sydney Briar.

105
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:09,348
She probably... owes Laurel Ann
quite a few more! Stay tuned!

106
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:12,810
Now, in our top story today...

107
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,896
a big, cold,
dull, dark, white...

108
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,401
empty, neverending,
'blow-my-brains-out'...

109
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:22,694
seasonal affective disorder...

110
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:24,778
freaking 'kill-me-now'
weather front...

111
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:27,324
that'll last... all day.

112
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:31,617
Or maybe,
when the wind shifts, later on...

113
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:34,995
we'll get a little green-house
gas relief from the industrial south.

114
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,707
'Hail Mary, Yea, though I walk'...
we go to Ken Loney...

115
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:41,251
in the 'Sunshine Chopper'.

116
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:44,754
It's always brighter
above the clouds, Grant.

117
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:46,755
Hey, Ken, how're you doin'?

118
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:50,592
How are things in that bird up there?
You're gonna stay up there during the storm?

119
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:53,135
Yes, Sir.
Yes, Siree,

120
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:55,513
Well, that can't be safe.
Is that safe, Ken?

121
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:58,057
Well, I'll be up here, Grant,
on storm watch,

122
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:00,476
watching all of the routes
in and around our region.

123
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,644
- Really?
- Really, yup.

124
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:07,984
Okay, Ken. Boy, I wouldn't wanna be a bird,
if this storm hits the way it's supposed to.

125
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:10,400
Well, folks,
in and outta the region...

126
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,610
Don't call it bird, by the way, Grant.
And leave Ken alone!

127
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,738
go slow folks,
we do have a tractor-trailor...

128
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:14,990
I think he's just concerned.

129
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,615
carrying wind generator blades...

130
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:19,701
along the 4-0-1.
So, slow going east-bound.

131
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,703
That's it from the 'Sunshine Chopper'.

132
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:25,288
Remember drink that fruit,
get's you up, keeps you going.

133
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,124
Thanks you, Ken Loney.

134
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:30,376
Breaking news
out of Caesarea this morning...

135
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,043
Come on, boy...

136
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,087
There we go!

137
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:35,090
Breaking news:

138
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,927
The Ontario Provincial Police,
are reporting a major bust...

139
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:44,514
of a significant grow operation
in a quiet cul-de-sac in that town.

140
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,559
Constable Howard Ing says
it's a sign of things to come.

141
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,812
These, uh... operations in suburban
small town neighborhoods...

142
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:54,690
are the grow-method
of choices...

143
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,149
Do you smoke pot, Syd?

144
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,525
Yes, I do.

145
00:09:57,525 --> 00:10:00,193
Don't make global warming jokes.

146
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:02,446
What? I didn't make a joke,
I quoted the Bible.

147
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:03,989
Ain't no jokes in the bible.

148
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:07,241
Speaking of the Bible,
we are in a church, not a dungeon.

149
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:12,245
Thanking you, Constable Howard Ing,
of the Ontario Provincial Police.

150
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:14,164
You know...

151
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:16,542
Our local pot growers...

152
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:20,128
are engaged in a deadly
serious business.

153
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:23,755
Deadly, uh...
booby-traps...

154
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,966
protecting their operations
from prying eyes.

155
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,467
Land mines...
have been found...

156
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:29,678
- in the backyards...
- Cool it, Grant!

157
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:33,182
They have vicious attack dogs and
enough ammunition to arm a small country!

158
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,640
Now, these
are family neighborhoods, folks!

159
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:38,894
If Junior throws a ball
through one of their windows...

160
00:10:38,894 --> 00:10:41,812
he's just liable to trigger
a death squad!

161
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:42,813
What are you doing?

162
00:10:42,813 --> 00:10:46,067
My producer says... she's talking in my ear.
Luckily you can't hear her.

163
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:48,528
- Nobody cares, Grant, about your...
- Sydney says nobody cares.

164
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:49,736
- Maybe she's right.
- You forgot to do the closures...

165
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:53,489
- after the billboard, I need you to...
- But I think you do care, region.

166
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:55,990
"Taking no prisoners"...
you know what that means?

167
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,076
It means full disclosure,

168
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:59,370
- whatever the consequences.
- No, it's not 'full disclosure', Grant!

169
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,328
'School closure'.

170
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:03,539
I need you to read school closures.
That's what people need!

171
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,668
This is Radio 6-60,
the beacon...

172
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:09,836
Hey!... You can't just cut me off
like that! Jesus'...

173
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,966
OK, you know, Grant,
the whole 'full disclosure' schtick...

174
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,634
works better in a bigger context.

175
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,177
Well, actually,
this won't get me fired.

176
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,886
Well, there's that to.

177
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:23,432
The thing is... is that small towns,
already come without prisoners.

178
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,268
It's called "gossip" and it's
way ahead of you.

179
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,936
No no, Sidney,
I'm not talking about gossip.

180
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:31,730
I'm talking about building
a relationship with my listeners.

181
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,357
You know? Shaking 'em up...
a little bit.

182
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,485
OK, we do news, weather,
sports, local spots.

183
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:39,488
- That's what I need you to do.
- Hmm.

184
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:43,073
What the hell do you think
you have to disclose to us anyway?

185
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:46,451
And what it this that you think
we need to hear from you?

186
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:48,245
I don't know.

187
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:51,788
Well...
Actually, I do know, Sidney.

188
00:11:52,832 --> 00:11:54,750
I am trying
to piss a few people off,

189
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,504
because that's how it's done...
simple as that.

190
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,214
You see, a pissed off listener...

191
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:03,383
is wide awake listener,
and he ain't gonna change the station.

192
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:07,095
In fact, he may just call his pissed off
buddy, and get him to listen too.

193
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:09,679
And then, his pissed off buddy,
he might call his pissed off...

194
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,097
I don't know...
preacher.

195
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:17,520
And that, Lady Briar, is how you build
a loyal listening audience.

196
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:24,692
Uh... okay, well, I... That all sounds
perfectly pleasant, I'm sure, okay?

197
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:25,903
Um...

198
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,405
You know, Grant, you're first rate,
and you're doing a first rate job...

199
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:31,822
but just let me
tell you something...

200
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:35,952
Small towns, they're... they're...
they're fiercely proud places,

201
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:37,703
with... with proud people.

202
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:41,790
People who need to know
if the school bus is coming.

203
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,918
And so, if you come in here with your
'take no prisoners' "this"...

204
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:47,379
and your 'pissing everyone off'
"that",

205
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:51,673
people are just gonna think
you're a dick!

206
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,094
Okay... Okay.

207
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:58,388
I... I mean, you're going to
embarrass and alienate...

208
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:00,139
Okay,
I said okay.

209
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:02,850
I'm sorry,
it's just the reality.

210
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:04,436
Okay, uh... Grant,
I...

211
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:06,644
- I... I want your maziness.
- Okay.

212
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:08,938
I hired your maziness.
I want the maziness.

213
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:11,316
I just need the maziness
to come in a little slower,

214
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:16,196
a little more 'get to know you'.
A little... a little slower.

215
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,490
Yeah, I get it.
I'm not stupid.

216
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,240
That's not what I meant.

217
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,826
I wanted to hear
what he was gonna say.

218
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:26,870
Come on, he was just gonna talk
about himself.

219
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:31,333
Okay, Pontypool,
good morning.

220
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,503
You know, I wanna talk to you
about something that has been...

221
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:36,004
bugging me,

222
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:38,004
all morning.

223
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:52,393
Here's my question, Pontypool.

224
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:54,311
Here... here's my story.
Now, hold on...

225
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:59,191
I'm driving in to work today, I... and I
pull up to the stop sign at Drum and Main,

226
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:04,027
and... it's 6.30 in the morning,
and it's cold, and it's dark...

227
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:08,447
and suddenly, this woman
appears outta nowhere...

228
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,659
I didn't hear her,
and I barely was moving my car.

229
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:14,745
Suddenly...
she's at my passenger window.

230
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,038
She's babbling something
but I can't...

231
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:19,499
I can't understand her,
I can't hear her, I don't know what it is.

232
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:23,086
And then... 'poof'!
She's gone!

233
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:32,927
So, what do I do?
Do I call 911?

234
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,053
Who do I call?

235
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:37,097
No one.

236
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:41,851
Our number is
519-555-3486

237
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:45,062
Let me know
what I gotta do.

238
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:04,830
Good morning.

239
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:07,166
Oh, where are you calling from?

240
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:08,667
Uh-huh.

241
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,003
And what would you like to say
to Grant this morning?

242
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:17,590
- I'm sorry, what?
- Has my sister called in yet?

243
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:18,926
No.

244
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,219
Oh, that's weird...

245
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:23,846
My sister never, ever, ever,
misses a day.

246
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:26,139
And where's Roger?
It's almost 10.

247
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:28,015
What are those?

248
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:30,434
Grant gave us Valentines.
You can put them up somewhere.

249
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:34,022
You know, he, uh...
he's doing okay.

250
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:36,190
So, okay sweetheart,
I'm gonna call Mrs. Tripp.

251
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,107
Something's coming in
on the radio.

252
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:40,945
Roger, where are you?

253
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,361
Yeah. Roger that.

254
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:46,073
We still have a Code 48 in progress.
It's the fish hut.

255
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:47,908
- Sydney! Syd!
- Code 48 in progress...

256
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:51,662
requesting back-up,
weapon's present, 10-4...

257
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:53,955
Roger that.

258
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,125
- Sandy Hook and Wilmont, Code 48.
- Tell me, so what's Code 48, Laurel Ann?

259
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,629
It means
we have a hostage situation.

260
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,673
- Please, stand by.
- There's nothing on the wires,

261
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,966
so I'm gonna key in
right off the police radio.

262
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,967
Really, there's nothing on the wire?

263
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:12,471
Okay, so let's not do anything
with this yet.

264
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:19,519
Fat no,
I'm not getting anything either.

265
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,437
Whatever you do,
don't feed this in to Grant yet.

266
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,898
Oh, shit!

267
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:33,029
Yeah, Grant, it's Gordon calling, uh...
I just wanna throw this idea out there...

268
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:34,907
about the 9, uh...
the 911...

269
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:38,951
What if you had another number, that was,
I don't know, like, 912 or something,

270
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:41,163
that was not for total emergencies,

271
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:43,831
so if you had to...
get in a gray area...

272
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:47,334
and, uh... you weren't sure whether
you wanted to call 911, you'd call 912...

273
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,543
I... I... I just have a feeling
it just might catch on.

274
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:52,047
Some people might,
you know, uh... take it.

275
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:55,424
Gord, that's a great idea.
You should be running the world.

276
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:58,677
Pontypool... my Pontypool...

277
00:16:59,136 --> 00:17:01,096
We interrupt
our call-in segment...

278
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:04,516
to bring you breaking news
out of our area this morning:

279
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:08,019
Out on Sandy Hook and Wilmont
we have a hostage situation.

280
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:10,855
Two men are holding
a van load of people at gunpoint.

281
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:14,400
The van is apparently towing...
a fishing hut.

282
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:18,153
- Sporadic gunfire has been reported.
- Okay, lose the story, Grant.

283
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:21,488
We're going to Ken Loney.
We're going to the 'Sunshine Chopper'.

284
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:24,699
No one knows as yet
what these hostage takers want,

285
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:26,284
- or whether or not, they even know...
- We know they're drunk,

286
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,201
- the people in the van.
- Grant, it's the end of ice fishing season.

287
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:31,372
but... this being the end
of ice fishing season...

288
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:33,624
ice hut removal time...

289
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:36,419
the chances that everyone
on the ice this morning is drunk,

290
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,670
is a very distinct reality.

291
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:42,338
Drunk ice fishermen... dare I say:
drunk policemen?

292
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:43,798
Drunk officers of the law.

293
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,759
Drunk...
Ontario Provintial Police.

294
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,387
It is not yet confirmed
by our sources, of course.

295
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:52,182
But, police,
possibly drunk,

296
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:56,602
are reporting that the hostage situtation
has resolved itself.

297
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,895
They have two suspects in custody.

298
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,272
Both unarmed, as it turns out,

299
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:06,153
and the three people they were
holding have, in fact, fled the scene.

300
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,904
One can only hope,
the Breaking News theme music...

301
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,323
will accompany this story
at some point.

302
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,615
There we go.

303
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:16,035
Oh, the state of drunkenness
have levelled off...

304
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:17,744
to acceptable levels
this morning,

305
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:21,748
as 'Buddy' Bob Roseland and 'Dead Eye'
Derek McCormack, OPP Pontypool Division...

306
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:25,042
- Wrap it up, Grant!
- have contained the hostage situation.

307
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,253
We'll be back with updates,
as the situation hiccups.

308
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:31,923
We now go to Ken Loney
in the 'Sunshine Chopper',

309
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:34,468
for a little perspective
on your morning drive.

310
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:39,054
Keep an eye out for crazy ladies
in the snow, and remember:

311
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,849
Wherever you're headed,
get there safe!

312
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:56,193
Come on, you gotta learn to laugh
at yourself sometimes!

313
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,531
The story is not funny.

314
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:04,451
Derek McCormack
is an alcoholic.

315
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:08,747
Bob Roseland is an alcoholic.
They're trying to keep their jobs.

316
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,998
Oh...

317
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,210
Derek's my brother-in-law.

318
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:17,211
Ex... ex-brother-in-law.

319
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:19,798
Ouch!

320
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,799
- Grant...
- Hm.

321
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,179
Ken Loney is not in a chopper.

322
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,015
What?

323
00:19:31,223 --> 00:19:34,769
The 'Sunshine Chopper'
is Ken's Dodge Dart.

324
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,519
He plays sound effects.

325
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:43,609
Ken sits up on a hill,
for his aerial view.

326
00:19:45,403 --> 00:19:47,570
And... people are thrilled...

327
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,281
to have him up there in the sky,

328
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:52,660
flying around in his
'Sunshine Chopper', even though...

329
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,578
Oh man, I bet they are.
Okay.

330
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,204
Okay.

331
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,584
Syd...

332
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,044
Yeah?

333
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:07,506
I hate winter.

334
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:11,550
- Everybody does.
- No, not like me.

335
00:20:12,425 --> 00:20:15,512
These late winters, I feel like I'm living
in the basement of the world,

336
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:18,765
and it's so cold,
and so dark.

337
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,269
Yeah... it is.

338
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:25,688
Well, you're gonna...
it's gonna be okay.

339
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:32,777
Oh, and Grant, I... I'll tell you what: when
the whole fish hut story gets confirmed,

340
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:34,822
we'll bring it straight to you,
right away, okay?

341
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:36,655
And it's yours,
even if it's not legitimate...

342
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:39,909
you can do your whole...
"take no prisoner" thing, okay?

343
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:42,326
And you'll find it funny this time?

344
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:45,746
I'll find it as funny as I did
the last time, I'll betcha'!

345
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:08,391
I was talking to Constable Roseland...
he's totally serious!

346
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:10,352
I mean, he has completely freaked!

347
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,228
Something happened
this morning on the ice...

348
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:16,022
and it's put them on to a state...
and now, he wants us to drop the story.

349
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:17,023
Drop it?

350
00:21:17,023 --> 00:21:18,567
Now, it's probably nothing.

351
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,651
- And probably just a hoax,
- Probably.

352
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:22,819
Anyway, so, we've got the
'Laurence of Arabia' cast coming in,

353
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,570
so we're gonna brighten up
the day with that.

354
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:26,530
Laurel Ann here.

355
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,992
Okay, okay.
It's Ken Loney.

356
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:33,371
Hey, Ken!
Oh, Ken, slow down...

357
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:34,579
Yeah.

358
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:36,749
Ken, where are you?

359
00:21:37,457 --> 00:21:38,583
Okay.

360
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,585
Ken, slow down.

361
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:43,255
Slow down, and...
and how many?

362
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:49,925
Okay, Ken,
just a second.

363
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,136
Okay, wrap up
'Pontypool Corner', Grant.

364
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,721
We have a big story breaking.
Listen to me...

365
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:55,931
Keep it hard, okay?

366
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:58,099
Ken, just a second.

367
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:01,478
Just a second,
we're going live.

368
00:22:01,478 --> 00:22:03,605
We do double bill
this weekend...

369
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:05,315
so, I'll check it out
and make sure it's right,

370
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:06,732
that the're both
at the same time,

371
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:08,401
but that's what it looks like.

372
00:22:10,694 --> 00:22:13,655
We have breaking news
out of our region this morning.

373
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:17,491
It appears, it seems that a large
group of people have gathered...

374
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:23,122
outside the officies of Dr. John Mendez.

375
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:26,375
It appears to be a protest of some kind,

376
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:31,253
and officials are describing
the crowd as 'unruly'.

377
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:33,923
Now, Dr. John Mendez, you may recall,

378
00:22:33,923 --> 00:22:39,134
He was the... he was under investigation
for writing unnecessary prescriptions.

379
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:41,887
We have an exclusive live report,

380
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:45,641
from Ken Loney in the...
in the 'Sunshine Chopper'.

381
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,601
What can you see there, Ken?

382
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:50,519
Grant, I am...
I'm watching hundreds,

383
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:54,648
literally hundreds of people
packed in and around this building.

384
00:22:54,648 --> 00:22:56,900
and it... it looks pretty odd
from up here.

385
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,529
They seem to be, uh... trying to
cram themselves inside...

386
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:02,989
Oh!
Ohh!

387
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:04,699
What's happening, Ken?

388
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:09,536
The side of the office... this building
has just burst open, it's spilling people...

389
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:11,621
It... it...
it just kind of exploded!

390
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:12,663
Oh! Ooh...

391
00:23:12,663 --> 00:23:17,085
Jesus! It's an explosion of... of...
of people! Oh, my God!

392
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:20,797
People are... are...
they're getting trampled.

393
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:23,757
These people are getting killed
down there! Oh!

394
00:23:23,757 --> 00:23:24,924
Oh!

395
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:27,551
Ken, do you see any police?

396
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:31,805
Is anybody trying to restore order,
um... down there?

397
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:34,642
No! No... I don't see...
Wait... wait... wait... wait...

398
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:38,144
There's a... convoy of trucks...
military vehicles...

399
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:40,313
Where did they come from?
What the hell...

400
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:42,897
Helicopters...

401
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,732
Uh...
There's a...

402
00:23:44,732 --> 00:23:47,361
helicopter at my 2 o'clock
and one at, uh...

403
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:51,239
Holy shit, I gotta...
I gotta back up outta here.

404
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:54,575
Okay, Ken...
Ken... Get safe!

405
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:57,535
Now you just...
just try to get outta there.

406
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:58,911
The road is blocked.

407
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,085
There's definitely fatalities here, uh...
down there. People have just died, Grant.

408
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:08,127
I... I don't know what the hell
has just happened.

409
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:11,382
Well, we're, uh... we're gonna
have to see if we can, uh...

410
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:12,589
- Grant...
- Ken, what?

411
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:15,469
Ken?
Are you there, Ken?

412
00:24:16,051 --> 00:24:18,637
- We got nothing on this, Grant.
- We gotta get some information...

413
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:20,013
on what's clearly happening.

414
00:24:20,013 --> 00:24:22,473
- Christ, this is 5 km from here.
- Not more than 3...

415
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:24,974
uh... 5 km,
from the station itself.

416
00:24:24,974 --> 00:24:27,603
Don't say a lot, Grant
We need to get this confirmed somehow.

417
00:24:27,603 --> 00:24:31,148
Something has happened
at a doctor's office, here in Pontypool,

418
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:34,151
involving a possible riot.

419
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:36,943
- I can't get through to the OPP.
- Clearly, something has happened,

420
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:38,153
here in Pontypool.

421
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:39,945
Okay, we've lost Ken.
Go to break,

422
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,949
- go to recap, Grant!
- You heard Ken Loney describe...

423
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:46,411
what he saw, or at least
what he thinks he saw.

424
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,080
You know, the french philosopher
Roland Barthes...

425
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,794
once described trauma
as a news photo without a caption.

426
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:59,423
And that, folks, is what I think
we have here now.

427
00:25:05,218 --> 00:25:06,554
Is Ken back?

428
00:25:06,554 --> 00:25:07,511
We're trying.

429
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:09,722
We're trying in getting Ken back,
we're trying to reach the police.

430
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:12,433
Grant, we still have nothing
on the wire on this entire story.

431
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:15,060
Laurel Ann and I are gonna work the phones.
We're gonna work our sources.

432
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,979
We gonna try and find out something
solid we can put on the air.

433
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:19,521
Okay, and what do you want
me to do?

434
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:26,528
Well, um... "Lawrence and The Arabians"
have, uh... have come all this way. Yes, hi.

435
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:29,364
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

436
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:33,076
Grant, I don't need you
to be a problem right now.

437
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:36,621
But Sydney, Sydney, we got the hook,
and you can't just cut the line like that!

438
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:38,372
I just need you to do your job.

439
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:41,499
These 5 people, you're gonna interview them
and then they're gonna sing a song...

440
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:42,917
Sydney, do you really think...

441
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:47,421
that this is what our audience
is expecting to hear from us right now?

442
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,467
So Laurel Ann and I
will dig up a story on this,

443
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:53,969
that we can put on the air.
Thank you.

444
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,141
Okay. Okay, fine...
let's do it!

445
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:05,438
Let's find out how the fuck rehersals
are going in fucking Arabia!

446
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,481
Come on, gang!
Come on!

447
00:26:28,623 --> 00:26:30,040
Listen to this, Rick.

448
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:38,048
This is Lawrence of Arabia.

449
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,806
Something's definitely happening,
we can't just leave this.

450
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,599
We can't go back on the air
without something solid.

451
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,935
Laurel Ann, find me somebody
I can put on the air.

452
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:56,063
Well, I've got Aline Freethy
on line two.

453
00:26:56,063 --> 00:26:58,441
She's hysterical, but she seems to be
in the middle of things.

454
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,777
Okay, see if you can calm her down,
see what she's got.

455
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:04,445
Why isn't there anything,
anywhere, on this?

456
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:07,948
These are prior...
Bedouin girls.

457
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:09,824
Grant, we're trying for eye witness...

458
00:27:09,824 --> 00:27:12,619
we'll have somebody for you
when your singers are done.

459
00:27:14,372 --> 00:27:16,414
This is Osama bin Laden.

460
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:44,145
Fuck you, Rick.

461
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,861
Okay, now that was... Tony Burgess,
Maureen Hinkle, Nancy Freethy,

462
00:27:51,861 --> 00:27:56,199
Jay Pullman and Colin Pullman
singing "The Nefud Desert"

463
00:27:56,199 --> 00:28:00,117
I can't remember how it ends,
I can't remember how it ends...

464
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,246
How what ends, Faraj?

465
00:28:04,246 --> 00:28:07,040
It just keeps starting over and over...
and over and over...

466
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,962
and it is not called 'The Lawrence and...
the table' is it? No, not anymore...

467
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:32,855
Okay, folks.
I guess that's it.

468
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:36,483
Ok, I've got Steve Van Denzen.
He's at the Mendez' office,

469
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:39,443
and he's talking about a mob, or parade,
or something. He's very excited.

470
00:28:39,443 --> 00:28:41,153
- Have you any word from Ken?
- Nothing.

471
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,697
Shit! I'm gonna keep trying
Roseland.

472
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:46,075
see if you can get any straight talk
from Van Denzen.

473
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:59,501
Sydney, there's something very weird
going on with our... girl Faraj there.

474
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:02,963
Ok, you were great, Grant!
You did your job and...

475
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:04,090
Didn't you hear?

476
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,259
Yeah, I know you really wanted to stay
with the story.

477
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:10,011
I needed you to buy us some time,
and I appreciate it. I really do.

478
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:13,890
So... I have something now,
and I'm tossing it all back at you.

479
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,308
- Okay, great! What do you got?
- There's still nothing...

480
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:18,227
anywhere on the wire
regarding this mob scene,

481
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,561
I've got ten
eye witnesses in town.

482
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:22,230
We're going live,
with Steve Van Denzen.

483
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,148
That's great!

484
00:29:23,148 --> 00:29:26,567
- Fuck the wire if we've got eyes!
- Okay, keep it hot, Grant!

485
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:28,778
Girl, you got it! Hit me!

486
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:31,864
Any word from Ken?

487
00:29:31,864 --> 00:29:33,365
Nothing.

488
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:35,616
Welcome back, folks...

489
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,367
to our developing story...

490
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:40,703
where it appears that hundreds
of people have been involved in a riot,

491
00:29:40,703 --> 00:29:45,542
in and around the offices
of Dr. John Mendez.

492
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:49,961
You heard our own Ken Loney
describe the violent scene.

493
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:54,883
We now go t... live,
to eye witness Steve Van Denzen.

494
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:56,175
Steve?

495
00:29:59,221 --> 00:30:02,848
Steve?
Steve Van Denzen?

496
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:07,894
Okay, I... I'm afraid
we've lost the signal from, uh...

497
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:11,021
Steve Van Denzen. We'll try
and return to him later, but, uh...

498
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:15,150
we have just had a report from a
Pontypool resident, that confirms...

499
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,195
indeed, a mob was spotted,
earlier today...

500
00:30:19,195 --> 00:30:23,907
headed through town, headed toward
the offices of Dr. John Mendez.

501
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,492
Apparently they were moving...

502
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,994
And, uh...
they, uh... they, uh...

503
00:30:28,037 --> 00:30:29,954
- we're still waiting to learn exactly...
- Shit, I've lost my eye witness!

504
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:34,040
what motivated this crowd,
this, uh... this mob, uh...

505
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,794
- to organize in a seemingly...
- Grant...

506
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,586
- spontaneous, fashion.
- I think people are fucking with us.

507
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,338
You know, it's...
it's very difficult...

508
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,923
at this moment, to get a fix
on what has happened, but clearly...

509
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:46,094
Well, you heard our own
reporter Ken Loney earlier...

510
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,555
I don't know, Grant. I don't know,
we can't get Ken back on the line.

511
00:30:49,555 --> 00:30:52,015
- We are still trying to, uh, get...
- This is completely...

512
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:54,602
- Ken back on the line.
- fucked! I don't know what's going on!

513
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,353
C.L.S.Y.

514
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:02,191
Can you slow down?
I can't understand what...

515
00:31:02,357 --> 00:31:04,025
- C.L.S.Y.?
- Okay, hello?

516
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:11,073
We have also learned that some of the
perpetrators are speaking in bizarre ways.

517
00:31:11,073 --> 00:31:13,409
They're babbeling in ways
that no one understands...

518
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:18,788
and we don't know if this is a way of... of,
trying to terrorize people? We don't know.

519
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:20,499
Hello, C.L.S.Y.

520
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,709
I'm sorry, what did you say?

521
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:25,836
We still do not have
an official version of these events...

522
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:27,795
- Okay, sounds good.
- but it has been reported...

523
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:30,213
- that up to 75 people are dead.
- Sounds honest.

524
00:31:30,213 --> 00:31:31,508
- It is honest.
- And, uh...

525
00:31:31,508 --> 00:31:34,635
- at least twice that number are injured.
- I've CBC and CFRB on the line,

526
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:35,677
wanting to talk to you.

527
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:38,721
We now take you to
Constable Bob Roseland,

528
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:42,517
of the Pontypool unit of the OPP.
He's on the line, live.

529
00:31:42,557 --> 00:31:46,060
Constable Roseland,
what's happening out there?

530
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:51,150
At 7 o'clock this morning
our officers answered a 911 call,

531
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,152
to the Golden Dawn facility,

532
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:56,863
to discover a large number of people
occupying the building.

533
00:31:56,863 --> 00:32:00,865
They seemed to be trying to get
into the elderly woman's room...

534
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:04,786
and this woman has since died,
from incidental injury...

535
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:06,287
- Grant, appearently these people were...
- as a result of people...

536
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:08,498
- chanting something, a little creepy...
- piling into her room.

537
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:11,083
- chanting something...
- And what where they saying?

538
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:14,336
They were repeated things
this woman was saying.

539
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,548
She's all senile,
so she's babbling about Hitler...

540
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:18,882
and some hurricane...

541
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,299
- Crazy talk. Get off, Grant!
- that killed her mother and father...

542
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:22,717
Okay, thank you,
Constable Roseland.

543
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:27,932
Now, we are also hearing...
about a herd...

544
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:33,602
Well, that's how it's been described:
a herd of people...

545
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,025
near the edge of the forest
near Highway 26, in Edenvale.

546
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,693
Where is Edenvale, Sydney?

547
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:43,987
That's northwest.

548
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:46,698
Now, Edenvale is northwest of us.

549
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,490
And, also, between here and there,

550
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,076
- in Phelpston, a couple...
- Please, keep holding. Thank you.

551
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:57,998
with their 2 young children had been trapped
in their car, under a mountain...

552
00:32:57,998 --> 00:32:59,708
- A mountain of people...
- Okay. Apparently, Grant, I'm being told...

553
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:01,291
by Rachel Jones,
that these people were...

554
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,795
- Now, this sounds strange, folks...
- imitating windshield wipers.

555
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:06,255
- but this what's being reported to us.
- Making the sound of windsheild wipers.

556
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:13,679
The police say they haven't been able to,
uh... actually see the car in over an hour.

557
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,930
- Can I put your call on hold for a sec?
- They sound like bugs.

558
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:19,266
- Sydney, I've got BBC World on the line.
- BBC?

559
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:20,977
There are a growing number
of eye witness accounts,

560
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:25,896
but we still have had nothing official. No,
uh, no press conference, uh, has been held,

561
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:27,732
- and we have no official statement.
- Grant,

562
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:29,567
I've got Nigel Healing for you.

563
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:30,817
What?

564
00:33:30,817 --> 00:33:33,278
Yes, Nigel Healing from the BBC.
Don't talk to me, talk to him.

565
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,154
Listen! It's our air, their air,
they wanna go live. Let's just do it!

566
00:33:36,154 --> 00:33:38,867
We're talking to Grant Mazzy,

567
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:44,079
the news radio anchor from Pontypool,
Ontario in Canada, who broke this story.

568
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,623
Mr. Mazzy, are you there?

569
00:33:47,957 --> 00:33:50,919
- Grant!
- Yes, Nigel. Hi.

570
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:57,133
Mr. Mazzy, is it true that French-Canadian
soldiers have set up road blocks...

571
00:33:57,133 --> 00:34:00,510
preventing people from leaving
and entering your area...

572
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,136
- in rural Canada.
- I havn't heard anything...

573
00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:04,640
about this, Grant. I don't think he knows
what he's talking about.

574
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,516
And if so, does this have anything
to do with your country's history...

575
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:10,684
of separatist terror groups?

576
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:13,436
Well, uh...

577
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:17,983
Nigel, um...
none of that is true. Um...

578
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:22,153
The military, of course, is, uh...
is rumored to be involved,

579
00:34:22,153 --> 00:34:26,574
and, of course, the police are
responding as we speak, but, uh...

580
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:30,619
from what we can tell
there's nothing organized, uh...

581
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:36,416
nothing political, uh... cartainly not
terrorist... or... or... or separatist.

582
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:42,086
But, uh... Mr. Mazzy, this certainly
looks like an insurgency of some kind.

583
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:45,090
Large groups of people
are involved.

584
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:50,219
But, if it's not organized, as you say,
and it's not political,

585
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,097
then can you help our viewers...

586
00:34:53,097 --> 00:34:57,016
uh... at home understand exactly
what it is we've been reporting on?

587
00:34:57,016 --> 00:34:58,518
He's good.

588
00:34:59,603 --> 00:35:05,398
Nigel, the honest truth is that no one
has officially come out ahead on this.

589
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:09,693
Uh, we...
simply do not know.

590
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:10,778
There you have it.

591
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:14,657
A series of strange riots
and violent mob scenes...

592
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:20,079
in rural Canada, that no one, I repeat,
no one can explain.

593
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,414
Meanwhile, reports presist that
French-Canadian riot police...

594
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:26,876
have been called in to
crush this insurgency.

595
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:30,128
Fuck you, Nigel!
He knows nothing!

596
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,213
Where are you?

597
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,050
Okay, I'm gonna pass you
through to Syd.

598
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,969
- I've got Ken.
- Ken!

599
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:43,681
That was Nigel Healing
from our affiliate station, BBC.

600
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:48,311
We now go to Ken Loney,
live in the field in Pontypool.

601
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:50,521
Our reporter Ken Loney.

602
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:52,313
Ken? Ken?
Are you there, Ken?

603
00:35:53,815 --> 00:35:55,108
Yes...

604
00:35:55,108 --> 00:35:57,152
Yes, I'm here.

605
00:35:58,027 --> 00:36:00,362
Send someone,
I'm not safe here.

606
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:02,364
Not safe where, Ken?

607
00:36:02,364 --> 00:36:03,949
Oh, don't say where he is,
in case something happens...

608
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:06,326
at the grain silo.
I'm near the train tracks.

609
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:08,621
It's a big silo,
not the little ones.

610
00:36:08,621 --> 00:36:12,456
I ran here from the entrance
of the Imecan National Park.

611
00:36:13,414 --> 00:36:16,041
They came after me...
You gotta send police.

612
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,543
There's no contact
with the police, Grant.

613
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:19,211
There's no reaching the police.

614
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:22,340
Can you tell us what heppened?
What's happening there, Ken?

615
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:24,967
I'll tell you this...

616
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,760
I just saw...

617
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:32,974
I've seen things today that are gonna ruin
the rest of my natural life, Grant...

618
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:36,684
and I'm... I'm scared...
I'm scared...

619
00:36:38,103 --> 00:36:40,938
Ken... Ken, listen to me.

620
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:42,733
Uh...

621
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:45,818
It sounds like you're okay,
where you are,

622
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:48,612
so don't move,
and you just stay there,

623
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:49,947
- and we're gonna...
- They're like cannibals,

624
00:36:49,947 --> 00:36:54,449
some of them are naked,
and... they're like dogs.

625
00:36:55,201 --> 00:37:01,916
Their eyes... that look...
it's just, uh... startled, wild...

626
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,126
Oh God, Grant!

627
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,336
- Okay Ken, listen... listen...
- No, no, no!

628
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:09,672
You don't understand,
I'm looking, uh...

629
00:37:09,672 --> 00:37:12,340
through a little door, there's a little door
at the base of the door...

630
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,302
some kind a... a cat door, or something.
and I can... I can see the... uh...

631
00:37:18,054 --> 00:37:22,016
Okay... let me move
so I can see the...

632
00:37:22,434 --> 00:37:23,684
No!

633
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:28,896
Look Out!... Oh God, they're...
they're pulling 2 people out of a van.

634
00:37:28,938 --> 00:37:30,148
Who are they, Ken?
Who are they?

635
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:33,275
There's a bunch of them, they're...
they're people, but... but they're crazy.

636
00:37:33,275 --> 00:37:37,905
They're... they're pulling these 2
out of the van. Oh, my God!

637
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:39,947
They're... they're biting them!

638
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:40,949
They're...

639
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:44,411
actually carrying them
to the ground in their mouths!

640
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,789
I can't, oh...

641
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:54,585
I can't see, they're... they're biting,
there's just biting, they look like, a...

642
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:57,838
a school of fish,
like a frenzy... or a piranha.

643
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:00,257
It's almost as if, uh...
like, uh...

644
00:38:00,882 --> 00:38:02,009
It's just what it looks like...

645
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:06,137
It really looks like these pople are
trying to climb, or eat their way inside!

646
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:09,764
They're so desperate,
like they have to be inside...

647
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:15,186
One has his entire leg and
another his arm... it's right inside...

648
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:16,396
Stop this, Grant!

649
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:18,648
- Now they're pulling themselves apart!
- Okay Grant, stop this now!

650
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,358
Fuck!

651
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,318
Oh shit! He heard that...
one of them looked over.

652
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:28,572
He heard me. Oh, he's coming. Holy shit!
I gotta hide! He's running! He's running!

653
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:34,744
Ken, get out of there.

654
00:38:35,204 --> 00:38:41,083
Ken? Ken, it's Grant. Are you...
are you injured? Have you've been hurt?

655
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,168
No.

656
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:50,592
No. I'm... just lying here.
I'm in the dark.

657
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:53,762
It... It crashed through the wall,
it was...

658
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:56,639
huh... Mary Gault's boy.
- Oh my god.

659
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,849
- Her big teenager Jessie, or Jake...
- Jessie...

660
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:02,101
or something? It was him.
He, uh... he had no hands...

661
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:04,936
- The kid had no hands...
- Grant, let's stop this now!

662
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:08,940
- What's he doing now?
- Not on the air, Grant.

663
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,735
I'm not gonna listen to somebody
get killed on the air.

664
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:13,862
He's looking at me...

665
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:19,949
I think he can't move, uh...
He must've, uh... broken some bones.

666
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:25,163
I can see his eyes...
He can't move... Wait, wait...

667
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:29,250
- I think he's... hang on...
- No.

668
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:33,295
Ken, whatever you do,
don't go near him.

669
00:39:36,547 --> 00:39:41,927
He's... he's whispering something.
He's... he's saying something...

670
00:39:42,092 --> 00:39:45,514
I'm gonna get closer and see if I can just
hear what he is saying...

671
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:48,059
No, I wouldn't do that, Ken.

672
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,291
What the hell was that?

673
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,293
- Ken?
- They cut into our signal!

674
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,547
Ken? Do we still have Ken?

675
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:26,757
- No, we've lost Ken.
- We've lost Ken, folks.

676
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,219
We are working
on a translation of, uh...

677
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,721
of the message
we just received live on the air.

678
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:35,639
It's something about
"avoid family members"...

679
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:38,726
"Talk only to babies"...
It's crazy shit.

680
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:42,896
- however, working on a translation.
- Okay, I've got it!

681
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:44,023
It's on your screen.

682
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:46,817
Okay, we have the translation.
Now, I'm gonna read this,

683
00:40:46,817 --> 00:40:50,318
reminding our listeners that the source
has not yet been identified...

684
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:52,862
and early analysis has identified...

685
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:55,239
this as possibly a hoax
of some kind.

686
00:40:55,824 --> 00:41:00,829
And I remind you that the source was not us,
and indeed, we do not know the source.

What've you got?

695
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:47,951
That was Bob Roseland.
He said we have to stay inside.

696
00:41:48,702 --> 00:41:50,746
Pontypool's under quarantine.

697
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:53,456
Everybody's have to stay inside
at all times.

698
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:02,130
Did you get...?

699
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,505
Hello. Hello.

700
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:05,259
- Did you get that?
- Ken?

701
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:08,594
I'm sending you some audio with my phone.

702
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:11,137
- Thank God, Ken! Are you there?
- Did you get that?

703
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:14,474
No, Ken, I didn't get that. I didn't,
I don't get anything right now.

704
00:42:14,474 --> 00:42:19,438
Okay, okay, listen, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna try that again. Okay, listen...

705
00:42:19,438 --> 00:42:22,190
and... and... and keep in mind...
picture this...

706
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:29,445
This is what you... you're about to hear
is coming from Mary Gault's big teenage boy.

707
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:32,490
He's lying here, in the dark,
with his body...

708
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:35,784
It's broken to pieces, and his wrists.
I... I can see them... They're stumps.

709
00:42:35,784 --> 00:42:39,329
They're not stumps,
they're pointing up... at his sides.

710
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:41,371
No, Grant! What are we doing?

711
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:43,248
Listen... listen...
listen... listen...

712
00:42:51,798 --> 00:43:00,264
Mommy... Mommy...
Help me...

713
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:06,728
Help me... Mommy...
Help me...

714
00:43:06,728 --> 00:43:09,480
Help me please...

715
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:16,777
Did you hear that? I do not even know
how he's doing that.

716
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:23,492
It sounds like there's a... a child
is screaming inside his breath...

717
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:28,079
- Is this actually happening, Ken?
- Easy, Grant. Easy!

718
00:43:33,626 --> 00:43:38,211
Alright.
That was our own Ken Loney.

719
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,260
What?

720
00:43:44,427 --> 00:43:48,472
That was our own Ken...
Ken Loney...

721
00:43:48,472 --> 00:43:52,391
- You're on the radio, ain't cha...
- interviewing...

722
00:43:52,391 --> 00:43:55,894
- You are on the radio, you big...
- a screaming baby...

723
00:43:55,894 --> 00:44:01,733
coming from Mary Galt's eldest son's
last dying gasps.

724
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:03,652
Mazzy in the morning...

725
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:04,902
- Grant.
- What?

726
00:44:05,152 --> 00:44:08,239
Grant... fish,
there were gold fish in it.

727
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:11,949
There was a little baby...
A tiny little baby...

728
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:15,161
- Grant!
- What?

729
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:27,047
Hey, Grant. Listen to this.
BBC is going wide with the Mendez story.

730
00:44:28,255 --> 00:44:31,757
He just said "Honey". He just said
"Honey, the missing cat poster".

731
00:44:32,884 --> 00:44:35,052
- What?
- He said "Honey" the missing...

732
00:44:36,762 --> 00:44:38,932
"Honey, the missing cat", Grant?

733
00:44:46,563 --> 00:44:48,146
Grant?

734
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:54,985
Oh, jeez. Laurel Ann, let's go out.
School closures... 5, 4...

735
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,583
Are you finding this funny, Syd?
Are you laughing?

736
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,963
It's not a joke, Grant.

737
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:17,507
Honey, I'm beginning to think
this is not a joke.

738
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,094
Grant, everything that I've got
looks real.

739
00:45:22,885 --> 00:45:24,471
The cat?

740
00:45:24,887 --> 00:45:27,264
Well, Nigel Healing said,
apparently...

741
00:45:27,306 --> 00:45:31,434
"Nigel Healing said, apparently"...
Can you fucking hear yourself?!

742
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:36,648
Don't yell at me, Grant!

743
00:45:38,733 --> 00:45:40,483
Oh, uh...

744
00:45:41,235 --> 00:45:42,360
I'm sorry...

745
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:51,284
Syd... you know I'm having...
lots of trouble here... believing this.

746
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:55,538
I know, Grant.
I know. Me too, okay?

747
00:45:55,748 --> 00:45:58,583
I mean, is somebody...
pulling my leg, are they, uh...

748
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:01,918
like, uh... taking a piss
out of me? You know?

749
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:06,005
Like it's some kinda stunt?

750
00:46:08,965 --> 00:46:10,927
Well, there's some dead people.

751
00:46:12,471 --> 00:46:14,472
A pretty big number, I think.

752
00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:23,771
Look, I gotta get outta here, okay?

753
00:46:23,771 --> 00:46:26,981
I'm having a lot of trouble believing
that this is actually happening, ok?

754
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:30,110
So, uh... I'm just gonna get
outta here for a minute.

755
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:32,653
Grant. Grant, I just need you
to sit back down...

756
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:36,072
You stay there, okay? I need you
in your chair. You need to sit back down.

757
00:46:36,072 --> 00:46:38,199
Okay, we've got crickets.

758
00:46:38,951 --> 00:46:40,702
- Laurel Ann, go to pre-tape.
- What pre-tape?

759
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:44,371
I don't care! Anything, just go to pre-tape!
Wait... where you going?

760
00:46:55,132 --> 00:46:58,759
Hey, um... you know,
I need you back in the chair, okay?

761
00:46:58,759 --> 00:47:01,094
Uh... I never did this.
Oh, man.

762
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:04,306
I gotta go outside, and, uh...
take a look at, uh...

763
00:47:04,306 --> 00:47:05,556
Grant?

764
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:09,476
Grant, I can't have dead air!

765
00:47:09,518 --> 00:47:13,271
Sydney, does this have
something to do with me?

766
00:47:13,855 --> 00:47:15,523
What are you talking about?

767
00:47:15,523 --> 00:47:21,820
This! I mean... why? Why are they
carrying dead cat pictures, huh?

768
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:25,699
I mean, this is me going crazy.

769
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:31,079
You know, I need to feel that there's
something solid. I need to confirm...

770
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:35,458
I need to... to know that there's
more happening to everyone,...

771
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:38,710
then than what's happening
to just me, you know?

772
00:47:39,585 --> 00:47:40,461
Grant, come on!

773
00:47:40,503 --> 00:47:43,172
You! You are fucking with me!

774
00:47:43,672 --> 00:47:45,423
You are fucking with my head!

775
00:47:45,423 --> 00:47:48,719
And you!
Don't you fuck with me!

776
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:59,103
Grant! Grant, come on!

777
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:00,603
It's dangerous!

778
00:48:01,063 --> 00:48:03,983
- Don't go, Grant! There's people dying.
- People are dying, Grant.

779
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:07,275
I gotta take a look out there.
I gotta see what's going on out there!

780
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,820
Don't go in the blizzard...
I need you on the radio!

781
00:48:10,862 --> 00:48:12,739
Don't walk out on me, Grant!

782
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:14,490
Please, I need you!

783
00:48:15,032 --> 00:48:16,159
Shit!

784
00:48:16,242 --> 00:48:19,079
Fine, just fucking fall apart!

785
00:48:19,454 --> 00:48:22,414
There nothing...
Just a cold, cold, cold day.

786
00:48:22,414 --> 00:48:23,706
Oh, shit!

787
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:24,750
What're you looking at?

788
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,126
Shit! Move!

789
00:48:28,878 --> 00:48:30,463
"Don't you walk out on me, Grant"
"Please, I need you".

790
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,547
- What was that?
- We have an enemy, sir.

791
00:48:33,798 --> 00:48:35,635
Laurel Ann, 'we've got an enemy'?

792
00:48:37,177 --> 00:48:38,637
Okay, what's going on?

793
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:41,139
Those are my words...

794
00:48:41,554 --> 00:48:42,599
Those are my words...

795
00:48:44,684 --> 00:48:46,184
What is going on?!

796
00:48:47,311 --> 00:48:48,811
- I'm scared!
- Sydney, listen...

797
00:48:48,811 --> 00:48:51,563
I'm scared, too.
You're cut!

798
00:48:51,563 --> 00:48:54,483
- Laurel Ann, we've got a first aid kit?
- Yeah, okay.

799
00:48:54,483 --> 00:48:56,443
- What's going on?
- Sydney, focus here.

800
00:48:56,443 --> 00:48:59,070
Focus. Look at me.
Where're your kids?

801
00:48:59,445 --> 00:49:01,197
They're with him.
They're in the city.

802
00:49:01,657 --> 00:49:03,615
That's a hundred kilometers away.
They're safe, right?

803
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:05,784
Oh, God. Yeah.

804
00:49:05,784 --> 00:49:07,661
They're safe, okay. We've got work to do.
I'm going back on the radio.

805
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:10,454
This is a hell of a shift, Sydney.
What's up first?

806
00:49:10,454 --> 00:49:11,706
Obituaries.

807
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:13,583
Obituaries?
Okay, but I've got nothing taped.

808
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,918
Then we'll go live!

809
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,003
Live! That's what I wanna hear.
Let's go!

810
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:22,715
"Gwendolyn Parker...

811
00:49:22,715 --> 00:49:27,469
was taken from this life in her 45th year
by her beloved husband Stanley...

812
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,266
who left this world suddenly, at the hands
of family members Fiona and Michael,

813
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:36,686
who then died at each other's hands in their
12th and 17th years respectively".

814
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:40,190
"Janice Gwynne has departed
from her abiding husband...

815
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,900
and by his own hand,
in her 34th year of her life".

816
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,360
Jack Gwynne survived long enough
to add four names...

817
00:49:46,902 --> 00:49:49,572
Paul Hieghton, 43,
Alice Hieghton, 42,

818
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:53,202
Brenda Hieghton, 12,
and young Jesse Hieghton, 10...

819
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:57,913
to a list of passages before himself
losing his life as a result of an accident".

820
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:03,041
"Greg Olan, 56, has been killed
by Yolanda Olan, 61...

821
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,543
who also removed Frieda Olan, 81...

822
00:50:05,543 --> 00:50:06,670
Patsy Owen, 12, John Freethy, 33,
Peter Stamp, 38 and Leslie Reid, 42...

823
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:16,135
who had, between them, caused the
untimely passings of Joel Froth, 67,

824
00:50:16,135 --> 00:50:18,597
Sandra Weydon, 23...
Tim Drummond, 17...

825
00:50:18,597 --> 00:50:21,016
Cynthia Drummond, 46...
Darren Drummond, 51...

826
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:23,934
and Alicia Drummond, 91".

827
00:50:24,434 --> 00:50:28,481
"The Drummond's were survived on
Cynthia's side by the Hindman family,...

828
00:50:28,481 --> 00:50:30,983
until shortly before noon today...

829
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:33,818
when they were sadly removed
from this world by a bus...

830
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:37,280
driven by the recently departed
Brenda Lockland, 43...

831
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,909
which was missed, briefly, by her husband,
Gary, 37... now deceased".

832
00:50:43,534 --> 00:50:46,538
You are listening to "In the Mourning" on
CLSY Radio.

833
00:50:48,623 --> 00:50:52,543
"David and Susan Varier Jones
married for 51 years...

834
00:50:52,918 --> 00:50:54,960
died suddenly in each other's arms,
by each other's grip".

835
00:50:55,628 --> 00:50:56,963
Are you listening to this?

836
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,965
I'm really trying not to...

837
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:04,929
Shit! I left my cell phone
in the sound booth.

838
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:08,014
I wanna talk to the kids.

839
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:10,641
When he's got them,
he turns the cell phone off.

840
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:12,851
Or doesn't pick up,
I don't know.

841
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,936
He's a jerk.

842
00:51:19,523 --> 00:51:24,987
So, did anything... this crazy
ever happen to you in Afghanistan?

843
00:51:26,739 --> 00:51:30,826
No. Sir. I believe the situation
I brought back in my head.

844
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:38,456
What do you... what do you mean?

845
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,295
I don't really know.

846
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:48,257
I'm gonna go see if Mr. Mazzy's missing.

847
00:51:50,259 --> 00:51:55,431
Missing... missing... missing

848
00:51:55,431 --> 00:52:01,851
I mean, Mr. Mazzy... Mr. Mazzy's missing,
as in 'he's not here'.

849
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,396
Well, honey. He's in the sound booth.

850
00:52:04,978 --> 00:52:08,065
- Yes, I know... I just...
- Ok?

851
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:12,152
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go...

852
00:52:49,184 --> 00:52:50,603
Excuse me?

853
00:52:52,688 --> 00:52:55,773
Sorry, please don't be alarmed.
I'm Dr. John Mendez.

854
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:57,108
I've not had a lot of time...

855
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:58,317
I've literally been crawling...

856
00:52:58,317 --> 00:53:00,735
on my hands and knees throughout
town, all over... and... and...

857
00:53:01,362 --> 00:53:07,324
OK, don't say anything, okay? Oh boy!

858
00:53:07,742 --> 00:53:09,367
She's has just started doing this.

859
00:53:09,994 --> 00:53:13,496
Sorry, I'm a doctor. We should slip out.

860
00:53:14,373 --> 00:53:16,625
Laurel Ann? Laurel Ann, honey.
Are you okay?

861
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:21,170
No, no. It's time to go and keep moving.
She'll follow our voices. We have to...

862
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,505
What's that?

863
00:53:22,505 --> 00:53:23,588
It's the sound booth.

864
00:53:23,588 --> 00:53:25,840
Life boat! Let's go!

865
00:53:25,922 --> 00:53:32,804
Mr. Mendez is missing Mazzy... No!
No, I'm Missy Mazzy and I have to...

866
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:36,641
We just need to get a bit
of lead time a head of her.

867
00:53:36,641 --> 00:53:37,768
Don't worry.
She doesn't have a voice...

868
00:53:37,768 --> 00:53:39,726
- What's wrong with her?
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!

869
00:53:43,146 --> 00:53:44,481
Grant! Grant!

870
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:49,235
- It's Dr. John Mendez.
- Mendez?

871
00:53:50,362 --> 00:53:52,239
You had the building that exploded?

872
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:54,197
I think he probably has
quite a story to tell.

873
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:55,699
Doctor, would you like
to have a seat?

874
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:56,949
- You mean, on the radio?
- Yeah.

875
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:59,119
Oh, yes, I have a story
one to tell.

876
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:04,456
No, guys. Wait! I'm not missing anymore.
I don't miss Mr. Mazzy...

877
00:54:04,456 --> 00:54:05,750
I think it might be
a little bit more interesting...

878
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,418
than with Nigel Healing, huh?

879
00:54:08,795 --> 00:54:11,128
- What going on?
- Your friend is sick.

880
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:12,630
I've seen a lot of this lately.

881
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:15,300
She doesn't know it yet,
but... she's hunting us.

882
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,302
I don't miss Mr. Mazzy.
I'm not missing anymore. Sydney!

883
00:54:28,978 --> 00:54:30,438
- She doesn't look...
- Hey, come on!

884
00:54:30,438 --> 00:54:32,231
We can't just leave her out there.
I wanna talk to her, Grant,

885
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:33,231
- put the sound out...
- No, no, no, no, no!

886
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:35,400
Let's leave the sound
sealed in here with us...

887
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,443
She might lose track of where we are,
if she can't hear us.

888
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:51,496
You are listening to 'The Beacon'.

889
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:57,043
We are holding our own here today,
and we are taking no prisoners, friends.

890
00:54:57,293 --> 00:55:01,965
However, today we are those prisoners.
We are tired and we are scared.

891
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,217
But, we have live with us Dr. John Mendez.

892
00:55:06,217 --> 00:55:07,971
Now, you may know him,

893
00:55:08,012 --> 00:55:12,014
or you may recall our own
Ken Loney's vivid account...

894
00:55:12,014 --> 00:55:18,103
of the violence that took place,
when the mob destroyed his practice.

895
00:55:18,436 --> 00:55:21,358
Now, Dr. Mendez,
we're looking to you.

896
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:26,277
You've had some special experience
with these, uh... with these events.

897
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:29,864
We would like any insights
that you can provide...

898
00:55:33,407 --> 00:55:35,869
Laurel Ann, don't do that! Stop!

899
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:39,206
Oh, she is rooting for voices. Huh-huh.
This will grow vicious.

900
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:49,713
I should mention that, uh, sadly...
very sadly, our own 'Homecoming Hero',

901
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,965
Laurel Ann Drummond,

902
00:55:51,965 --> 00:55:57,512
is right now experiencing
some kind of... dangerous seizures.

903
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,514
I've seen this,
what your friend's experiencing.

904
00:56:02,474 --> 00:56:04,143
Ok... can I? Ok.

905
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:08,313
I've seen elements of this.
She doesn't have a victim yet...

906
00:56:08,438 --> 00:56:12,900
So I'm not sure how this will end.
I mean... A victim suicides.

907
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,568
But.. the victim needs a victim
to suicide into.

908
00:56:15,568 --> 00:56:17,570
I know this is horribly
upsetting to you,

909
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:20,615
and I'm sorry to be the bearer
of such disturbing news, but...

910
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,449
- Sydney.
- I've seen this violent behaviour...

911
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:23,951
at my office all morning.

912
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:25,369
Yeah... Okay, we're going live.

913
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:28,371
- I've got Ken.
- Okay, thank you Dr. Mendez.

914
00:56:28,371 --> 00:56:29,623
We are now going to our...

915
00:56:29,623 --> 00:56:35,170
own reporter, Ken Loney, live in the field.
He's in a grain silo near Pontypool.

916
00:56:35,335 --> 00:56:36,461
Are you there, Ken?

917
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:41,257
I'm here, uh... Ken Loney,
reporting from inside the grain silo.

918
00:56:41,257 --> 00:56:43,927
And we were
very worried about you, Ken.

919
00:56:43,927 --> 00:56:49,556
I think I... I'm okay, but, uh... the person
that was in here with me, he has died.

920
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:53,101
Have you been there
all this time?

921
00:56:53,101 --> 00:56:54,518
Yeah, I... I haven't moved,

922
00:56:54,518 --> 00:56:58,856
but... you can hear, uh... crowds,
from time to time, passing by outside.

923
00:56:58,856 --> 00:57:01,108
Can you hear what they're saying?
Are they saying anything?

924
00:57:01,108 --> 00:57:05,610
Yeah, I have... you can hear them.
A group went by about an hour ago...

925
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:08,574
and they were talking about...
uh... "U-boats"

926
00:57:08,739 --> 00:57:12,242
Well, they weren't talking, really...
They were just sort of, uh... chanting...

927
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:15,244
Something about
"Look out for U-boats".

928
00:57:15,244 --> 00:57:18,289
"Look out for U-boats".
"Look out for U-boats".

929
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:21,583
Where they all saying this, Ken?

930
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:24,628
Yeah, yeah, all of them...
it's a symbol of the disorder.

931
00:57:24,628 --> 00:57:27,505
A 'symbol' of the disorder?
You mean... a 'symptom'...

932
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:33,135
It a simple... uh... it...
I have a problem.

933
00:57:33,385 --> 00:57:36,347
What's happening there, Ken?
Do you need to get to someplace safer?

934
00:57:36,347 --> 00:57:38,807
No, no... that's not it...
I, uh... I, uh...

935
00:57:39,224 --> 00:57:40,434
What's going on, Ken?

936
00:57:40,434 --> 00:57:44,061
It's gonna... it's gonna sound weird...
I can't stop thinking.

937
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,856
Do you have a 'sample'?

938
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:52,695
You said sample? Um...
a... a sample of what?

939
00:57:52,695 --> 00:57:56,739
Uh... just... a sample,
I think a simple kinda sample...

940
00:57:58,657 --> 00:58:03,786
You hear what I'm saying? I need to..
I can't stop... sample...

941
00:58:05,038 --> 00:58:06,706
It's so sample...

942
00:58:06,748 --> 00:58:10,626
sample... of what I'm trying...
sample of what I'm trying to say...

943
00:58:10,668 --> 00:58:14,003
- Just try to stay calm, Ken.
- I can't what I'm trying to say,

944
00:58:15,255 --> 00:58:17,590
- Grant, Grant...
- Ken...

945
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:20,592
- Ken?
- I'm just gonna try to... try to...

946
00:58:22,137 --> 00:58:24,472
- Can you think?
- I can't, I can not...

947
00:58:24,554 --> 00:58:26,306
Let's stick to simple questions, simple!

948
00:58:26,306 --> 00:58:28,224
Simple questions, simple...

949
00:58:28,224 --> 00:58:29,893
simple... simple...

950
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:32,853
That's it, he's gone.
This is what he is now...

951
00:58:32,853 --> 00:58:34,605
He's just a crude radio signal.

952
00:58:34,605 --> 00:58:35,688
He's seeking.

953
00:58:35,688 --> 00:58:42,403
Simple, simple, simple...
Simple, simple, simple...

954
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:47,157
I think it's time to say goodbye, Grant,
to our man in the 'Sunshine Chopper'.

955
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:49,409
Simple, simple, simple...

956
00:58:49,701 --> 00:58:54,038
Allright. Goodbye, Ken.
Goodbye from all of us,

957
00:58:54,914 --> 00:59:00,920
everyone listening,
I hope you can hear me, Ken. Goodbye.

958
00:59:07,007 --> 00:59:11,844
He's gone. Well, I mean.
He's gone... somewhere.

959
00:59:15,014 --> 00:59:16,974
I'm so sorry, Sydney.

960
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:23,813
Ken was, uh... he was a... he was a...
a really good friend of yours, wasn't he?

961
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,065
No, he's a...
he wasn't a friend...

962
00:59:27,983 --> 00:59:30,027
Ken Loney was a pedophile.

963
00:59:30,027 --> 00:59:32,987
I mean, not really a pedophile.

964
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:36,407
We just never let our kids
go anywhere near him.

965
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:42,871
It's just... I shoud've
not known him 17 years.

966
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:49,043
It's just...
such a long, long time.

967
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,677
Shit!

968
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:02,679
I wasn't a very good bucket.

969
01:00:08,851 --> 01:00:10,228
What's this now?

970
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:19,695
We're on, sir.

971
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:25,074
Uh... folks, um...
we're still here and huh...

972
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:28,452
little Laurel Ann
has joined us again.

973
01:00:28,452 --> 01:00:31,956
and, uh... anyway she's...
uh... looking... worse.

974
01:00:31,956 --> 01:00:34,373
She... she looks like,
she's been...

975
01:00:34,373 --> 01:00:36,918
- trying to eat something.
- Stop it.

976
01:00:36,918 --> 01:00:38,711
You sure she can't hear us?

977
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:41,170
No. No, she can't.

978
01:00:43,757 --> 01:00:45,425
Can she read lips?

979
01:00:46,384 --> 01:00:47,635
Good question...

980
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:51,597
Read lips...

981
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:52,641
What?

982
01:00:52,766 --> 01:00:58,186
Their timing, that's a very interesting
thing you just said. Can they read lips?

983
01:00:58,769 --> 01:01:03,523
Really? I know,
uh... interesting how? How?

984
01:01:03,523 --> 01:01:04,650
Uh...

985
01:01:04,817 --> 01:01:06,985
I should yet...
remind our listeners,

986
01:01:06,985 --> 01:01:10,280
- we are talking to...
- No! No, it can't be...

987
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,074
Can't be, it's impossible!

988
01:01:13,324 --> 01:01:15,159
What's impossible, Doctor?

989
01:01:15,284 --> 01:01:18,244
It's viral, that much is clear.

990
01:01:18,663 --> 01:01:20,704
But, uh... not of the blood.

991
01:01:20,704 --> 01:01:26,543
Of blood, not in the air.
Not on, or even in, our bodies.

992
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:29,755
It is here!

993
01:01:32,257 --> 01:01:33,467
Where?

994
01:01:37,762 --> 01:01:39,596
It is in words.

995
01:01:40,889 --> 01:01:42,222
Not all words...

996
01:01:42,222 --> 01:01:43,974
Not all speaking...

997
01:01:43,974 --> 01:01:45,601
But in some.

998
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:49,480
Some words are infected.

999
01:01:50,648 --> 01:01:53,817
And it spreads out when the
contaminated word is spoken.

1000
01:01:54,775 --> 01:01:56,068
Oh...

1001
01:01:56,068 --> 01:01:59,905
We are witnessing the emergence
of a new arrangement for life,

1002
01:01:59,905 --> 01:02:02,992
and our language is its host.

1003
01:02:02,992 --> 01:02:07,369
It could, uh... have sprung
spontaneously out of a... perception.

1004
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:09,996
If it found its way into language,

1005
01:02:09,996 --> 01:02:13,668
it could leap into reality itself,
changing everything!

1006
01:02:13,668 --> 01:02:18,670
It may be boundless...
It may be... a God bug!

1007
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,967
Okay, Dr. Mendez,
I don't even believe in UFOs,

1008
01:02:21,967 --> 01:02:25,844
so I gotta stop you there,
with that 'God bug' thing.

1009
01:02:25,844 --> 01:02:28,514
Oh, really? Well, that's really sensible,

1010
01:02:28,514 --> 01:02:30,099
beause UFOs don't exist,

1011
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:33,934
but I assure you, there is a monster lose,

1012
01:02:33,934 --> 01:02:36,936
and it's bouncing through our language,

1013
01:02:36,936 --> 01:02:39,856
frantically trying to keep its host alive.

1014
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:48,322
- Is this transmission itself. um...
- No, no, no, no, no, no...

1015
01:02:48,322 --> 01:02:51,199
If... if the bug enters us,

1016
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:54,869
it does not enter by making contact
with our eardrum. No.

1017
01:02:55,411 --> 01:03:01,626
It enter us when we hear the word
and we understand it. Understand?

1018
01:03:01,626 --> 01:03:08,047
It is when the word is understood,
that the virus takes hold,

1019
01:03:08,047 --> 01:03:12,550
and... it copies itself
in our understanding.

1020
01:03:20,766 --> 01:03:24,103
Well... should we be...
talking about this?

1021
01:03:24,103 --> 01:03:26,688
What are we talking about?

1022
01:03:26,688 --> 01:03:30,275
Should we be... talking at all?

1023
01:03:30,275 --> 01:03:37,447
Well, to be safe - no, probably not.
Talking is risky.

1024
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:43,869
And, well... talk radio is...
high risk, so... we should stop.

1025
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:52,253
But, we need to... tell people about it.

1026
01:03:52,253 --> 01:03:55,880
People need to know.
We have to... get this out.

1027
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,132
Well, it's your call, Mr. Mazzy.

1028
01:03:58,132 --> 01:04:00,467
Let's just hope
what you're getting out there...

1029
01:04:00,467 --> 01:04:02,719
isn't going to destroy your world.

1030
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,659
The whole world can hear you breathing.

1031
01:04:31,202 --> 01:04:33,204
It's fine, you're breathing.

1032
01:04:33,204 --> 01:04:35,164
That's your top news story!

1033
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:37,248
It can't take your breath away,
if you're breathing.

1034
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,416
- Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe...
Go to muzak, Grant.

1035
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,710
Muzak, key 14.

1036
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:47,050
Seems we're still talking.
Should we make our moratorium official?

1037
01:04:57,807 --> 01:05:00,811
- Hello?
- Here she comes.

1038
01:05:01,436 --> 01:05:04,146
Hey, Honey!

1039
01:05:07,065 --> 01:05:10,693
Hey, Sweetie...
are you and Brandon okay?

1040
01:05:12,695 --> 01:05:16,240
I miss you too so much, Honey.
I'll see you tomorrow, huh?

1041
01:05:20,827 --> 01:05:23,663
That's great, Honey.

1042
01:05:29,168 --> 01:05:33,420
Is your daddy there?
Can I talk to him really fast?

1043
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:37,423
Honey, I didn't forget to call you.
I just couldn't get through, Sweetheart.

1044
01:05:37,423 --> 01:05:39,010
You shouldn't be talking
to anyone who calls!

1045
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,637
And no "Sweethearts", please.

1046
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:43,097
You should be breathing more.
Breathe... breathe... breathe...

1047
01:05:44,139 --> 01:05:46,599
Just talking out loud.
Just talking out loud.

1048
01:05:46,891 --> 01:05:48,934
Could you please get your daddy on?

1049
01:05:53,148 --> 01:05:56,440
It's not your birthday today, Lulu.
it's Valentine's Day, Sweetie.

1050
01:05:57,275 --> 01:05:58,985
It's not really
a good time right now, Sweetie.

1051
01:05:59,027 --> 01:06:00,862
Can you just put your daddy on?

1052
01:06:05,532 --> 01:06:12,914
Happy Valentine's Day to you, Lulu!
Happy Valentine's Day to you, Lulu!

1053
01:06:12,914 --> 01:06:17,458
'Cause I love you...

1054
01:06:22,088 --> 01:06:26,092
Lulu? Lulu? Hello?

1055
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,887
Hello?
Oh, honey?

1056
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:34,266
Shit!

1057
01:06:38,186 --> 01:06:39,938
The phone lines are dead.

1058
01:06:43,148 --> 01:06:47,277
Something strange is happening to her,
I've haven't seen this before.

1059
01:07:12,047 --> 01:07:15,009
I forgot to give her at
Valentine's Day card.

1060
01:07:16,177 --> 01:07:20,137
Grant, thanks for the Valentine card.

1061
01:07:21,347 --> 01:07:24,474
I didn't say anything, I'm sorry,
It was very nice.

1062
01:07:39,237 --> 01:07:42,532
So, this is what happens when a
victim can't find a victim.

1063
01:07:42,532 --> 01:07:46,784
This is the fate they're trying to escape.
My God, that was impressive!

1064
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:48,746
Oh, oh, oh...
and... and... and singularily...

1065
01:07:48,746 --> 01:07:51,498
mostest defies comprehension!
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

1066
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,376
Breathe... breathe...
breathe...

1067
01:07:55,126 --> 01:07:56,836
Oh... here they come now.

1068
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:02,757
There must be hundreds of them,
pressed against the walls of this building.

1069
01:08:04,175 --> 01:08:05,675
What we need is a flamethrower.

1070
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:07,971
I thought we weren't supposed to talk.

1071
01:08:07,971 --> 01:08:11,641
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
You're right, you're right, you're right.

1072
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:00,993
Sydney Briar is alive

1073
01:11:03,787 --> 01:11:07,541
Sydney Briar is alive

1074
01:11:09,417 --> 01:11:12,421
Sydney Briar is alive

1075
01:11:13,587 --> 01:11:17,757
Sydney Briar is alive

1076
01:11:19,009 --> 01:11:20,426
I looped it.

1077
01:11:20,426 --> 01:11:23,470
Sydney Briar is alive

1078
01:11:23,637 --> 01:11:26,640
Sydney Briar is alive

1079
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,226
Sydney Briar is alive

1080
01:11:30,226 --> 01:11:33,020
Sydney Briar is alive

1081
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:36,442
Sydney Briar is alive

1082
01:11:36,442 --> 01:11:40,109
- Sydney Briar is alive
- We can breathe again...

1083
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:42,945
Sydney Briar is alive

1084
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:45,864
Sydney Briar is alive

1085
01:11:46,032 --> 01:11:49,243
Sydney Briar is alive

1086
01:11:49,243 --> 01:11:52,246
- Sydney Briar is alive
- breathe... breathe... breathe...

1087
01:11:52,246 --> 01:11:55,332
- Sydney Briar is alive
- breathe... breathe... breathe...

1088
01:11:55,332 --> 01:11:58,792
- Sydney Briar is alive
- breathe... breathe... breathe...

1089
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:02,002
- Sydney Briar is alive
- breathe... breathe... breathe...

1090
01:12:02,002 --> 01:12:05,300
Sydney Briar is alive

1091
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,719
Sydney Briar is alive

1092
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,595
Sydney Briar is alive

1093
01:12:11,595 --> 01:12:14,724
Sydney Briar is alive

1094
01:12:14,724 --> 01:12:18,310
Sydney Briar is alive

1095
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:21,604
Sydney Briar is alive

1096
01:12:21,604 --> 01:12:24,815
Sydney Briar is alive

1097
01:12:24,815 --> 01:12:27,734
Sydney Briar is alive

1098
01:12:27,734 --> 01:12:31,572
Sydney Briar is alive

1099
01:12:31,904 --> 01:12:34,782
- Sydney Briar is alive
- It's only the English that's infected.

1100
01:12:54,256 --> 01:12:56,634
Do you speak French?

1101
01:12:57,217 --> 01:12:59,552
A little bit?

1102
01:13:02,806 --> 01:13:05,350
We speak in French.

1103
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:10,811
Let's go.

1104
01:13:14,565 --> 01:13:15,609
Can I go?

1105
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:19,445
In French! In French!
Stay here.

1106
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:22,114
Goodbye!

1107
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:01,148
Where now?

1108
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,818
To the kitchen.

1109
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,873
Grant! Run... run now!

1110
01:14:21,873 --> 01:14:23,417
"Grant! Run... run now!"

1111
01:14:33,342 --> 01:14:34,594
Come get me!

1112
01:14:34,594 --> 01:14:37,095
"Come get me...
come get me"...

1113
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:16,587
He's still going!

1114
01:15:27,014 --> 01:15:29,181
Maybe... he is dangerous?

1115
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:32,601
Yes.

1116
01:15:33,185 --> 01:15:36,438
Are you going to kill the doctor?

1117
01:15:38,564 --> 01:15:40,024
No.

1118
01:15:41,358 --> 01:15:44,278
You killed the kid...

1119
01:15:44,278 --> 01:15:47,782
...you go kill the doctor.

1120
01:15:48,532 --> 01:15:52,201
I... I didn't kill the kid.

1121
01:15:52,284 --> 01:15:53,286
Yes.

1122
01:15:53,286 --> 01:15:54,703
- No.
- Yes!

1123
01:15:54,703 --> 01:15:56,162
- No.
- Yes!

1124
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,207
You killed the kid.

1125
01:15:59,207 --> 01:16:01,626
Not me!

1126
01:16:02,042 --> 01:16:03,711
Okay.

1127
01:16:04,671 --> 01:16:06,797
I killed the kid.

1128
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:09,215
So...

1129
01:16:09,466 --> 01:16:12,719
you kill the doctor.

1130
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,970
I? Please... no...
I'm...

1131
01:16:16,012 --> 01:16:18,347
I'm not gonna kill
the doctor. No.

1132
01:16:21,769 --> 01:16:22,976
Okay.

1133
01:16:28,774 --> 01:16:34,069
If the doctor attacks us...
I will kill him!

1134
01:17:09,976 --> 01:17:11,228
Here he comes!

1135
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:15,439
The door! the door!

1136
01:17:31,534 --> 01:17:34,037
Sydney Briar is alive

1137
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,207
Goodbye!

1138
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:10,860
He's saving us...

1139
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:38,260
Sydney Briar is alive

1140
01:19:37,978 --> 01:19:40,438
My name is Sidney Briar
and today I killed a girl.

1141
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:49,070
I'm so sorry.

1142
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:20,222
Why don't you speak up?

1143
01:20:22,182 --> 01:20:23,809
French!

1144
01:20:27,561 --> 01:20:30,021
Sorry!

1145
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:33,984
Continue.

1146
01:20:34,693 --> 01:20:36,403
Don't talk.

1147
01:20:43,242 --> 01:20:45,787
My head hurts!

1148
01:20:48,372 --> 01:20:53,667
For Christ's sake, give it up, Grant.

1149
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:59,881
There's no secret escape plan hidden
in the words that Nigel said to you.

1150
01:21:00,507 --> 01:21:02,509
Stop!

1151
01:21:14,853 --> 01:21:16,188
Stop it!

1152
01:21:29,448 --> 01:21:30,658
Syd...

1153
01:21:31,074 --> 01:21:35,662
We're not talking. I'm drunk.
This is how my last relationship ended.

1154
01:21:36,537 --> 01:21:38,872
Why do you stop understanding this?

1155
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:43,418
Oh, God!

1156
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,671
You're gonna eat me soon, aren't you?

1157
01:21:49,256 --> 01:21:53,427
That's OK. You be the killer.

1158
01:21:54,554 --> 01:21:56,221
I do not want to be the killer.

1159
01:21:56,221 --> 01:22:01,309
Something Dr. Mendez said: He said that
understanding a word copies the virus.

1160
01:22:01,309 --> 01:22:04,185
So how do you... how do you not
understand a word?

1161
01:22:04,685 --> 01:22:07,814
OK, you're talking... a lot...
right now...

1162
01:22:08,898 --> 01:22:10,525
Honey, I don't understand something.

1163
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:14,444
How, somethin' we understand automatically.
How do you take, you know, a word...

1164
01:22:14,444 --> 01:22:17,364
How do you make it strange?

1165
01:22:18,573 --> 01:22:24,953
We're gonna have killers in here soon,
if you keep killing your own rules, Grant.

1166
01:22:28,207 --> 01:22:32,377
I do not understand what disinfects it.
You see, that's the question.

1167
01:22:33,418 --> 01:22:38,173
If it disinfects it, without distorting it,
how... how do you do that?

1168
01:22:39,216 --> 01:22:43,094
You kill the word
that's killing you.

1169
01:22:43,094 --> 01:22:46,472
Oh, you kill the word that's killing you.
That's good, that's good! You repeat it!

1170
01:22:46,472 --> 01:22:48,307
Yeah, I remember as a kid,
I used to, uh...

1171
01:22:48,307 --> 01:22:51,185
I used to repeat words
over and over and over again...

1172
01:22:51,185 --> 01:22:53,854
'till whey were...
incomprehensible.

1173
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:56,730
Do you think that's what it is?
Is that why they're repeating things?

1174
01:22:56,773 --> 01:23:00,525
Is it some kinda
immune system response?

1175
01:23:01,818 --> 01:23:03,904
You have to kill...

1176
01:23:05,698 --> 01:23:06,657
all the killing.

1177
01:23:06,657 --> 01:23:10,534
Yeah, but it doesn't work, because they
repeat the words and still get sick.

1178
01:23:10,868 --> 01:23:14,037
So how do you make it...
unrecognizable?

1179
01:23:14,037 --> 01:23:17,332
How?
And what word?

1180
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:22,796
"Kill"...

1181
01:23:22,796 --> 01:23:26,631
Kill... kill... kill...

1182
01:23:26,631 --> 01:23:31,427
Syd...
are you okay?

1183
01:23:32,804 --> 01:23:37,974
Okay, Syd, Syd, alright
Look, Sydney,

1184
01:23:37,974 --> 01:23:41,603
I think you got an infected word.
You're infected.

1185
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:44,230
But we know the word...
Don't say anything. Don't say anything.

1186
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:45,774
No, no, no. Stop!

1187
01:23:45,774 --> 01:23:47,899
Stop! We know the word!

1188
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:52,070
Okay, 'kill' isn't 'kill...
Sydney, 'kill' isn't 'kill...

1189
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:59,578
'kill' isn't 'kill...
'kill' isn't 'kill...

1190
01:23:59,578 --> 01:24:02,871
Oh God. I do not know! I don't know...
I don't know... Okay! Okay!

1191
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:03,747
Alright...

1192
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:06,957
"Kill" is "blue" "Kill" is "wonderful"
"Kill" is... "Kill" is "loving"

1193
01:24:06,957 --> 01:24:09,501
'Kill" is the... 'Kill" is "baby"
"Kill" is the...

1194
01:24:09,501 --> 01:24:12,671
'Kill" is "Manet's Garden"...
'Kill" is, uh... "Beautiful morning...

1195
01:24:12,671 --> 01:24:14,047
"Kill" is everything
you ever wanted"...

1196
01:24:14,047 --> 01:24:16,173
"Kill" is...
"Kill" is "Kiss"

1197
01:24:16,173 --> 01:24:17,300
"Kill" is, uh...

1198
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:20,845
"Kill" is...

1199
01:24:20,845 --> 01:24:27,016
"Kill" is "Kiss". "Kill" is "Kiss".
"Kill" is "Kiss"! Is that it?

1200
01:24:27,976 --> 01:24:32,645
"Kill" is "Kiss"? "Kill" is "Kiss".
"Kill" is "Kiss". "Kill"... is... "Kiss".

1201
01:24:32,645 --> 01:24:36,899
"Kill" is "Kiss". "Kill" is "Kiss"?
"Kill" is "Kiss".

1202
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:38,862
What is "Kill"?

1203
01:24:40,028 --> 01:24:41,988
"Kiss"...

1204
01:24:44,573 --> 01:24:46,742
- Kill me...
- What?

1205
01:24:47,908 --> 01:24:50,619
Kill me...

1206
01:25:09,511 --> 01:25:12,472
"Kill" is "Kiss".
I got it.

1207
01:25:16,725 --> 01:25:18,770
Okay...

1208
01:25:18,935 --> 01:25:22,230
- Shh... shh... shh...
- Okay, I feel better.

1209
01:25:23,314 --> 01:25:25,817
- I feel better.
- Me too.

1210
01:25:28,444 --> 01:25:30,738
What just happened?
It's really confusing,

1211
01:25:30,738 --> 01:25:32,864
Seriously, seriously.
What just happened?

1212
01:25:33,573 --> 01:25:34,699
We just kissed.

1213
01:25:34,699 --> 01:25:37,577
- I know, I know, I know...
- It felt good.

1214
01:25:38,119 --> 01:25:40,872
What just happened...
to us, I know.

1215
01:25:40,997 --> 01:25:46,877
Sydney, I think...
something big just happened.

1216
01:25:47,627 --> 01:25:54,716
I think I just cured you.
Sydney... this is big. This is huge!

1217
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:55,760
Where you going?

1218
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,886
We gotta let people know about this.
We just found a way outta this!

1219
01:25:58,886 --> 01:26:03,182
Shit! Grant, wait, listen to me... Grant,
what're we doing? What're we doing here!

1220
01:26:03,182 --> 01:26:05,560
Come on, girl! One last show!

1221
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,895
One last... what? Grant...
Grant... Listen to me!

1222
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:12,774
We're not supposed to be even out here...
What are we doing here? It's not safe.

1223
01:26:12,815 --> 01:26:17,194
Syd, we're gonna save the fucking world.
Right now. How you feeling?

1224
01:26:17,194 --> 01:26:19,279
You don't even know
what you did, rather what you did,

1225
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:21,488
or how you did it.
Listen, listen, Grant! Stop!

1226
01:26:21,488 --> 01:26:22,864
Listen, you're way ahead of yourself!

1227
01:26:22,864 --> 01:26:26,578
We're okay, okay? We're okay. We're
save up there, if we just don't talk.

1228
01:26:26,578 --> 01:26:29,747
We have to stay safe,
what Mendez said. Take it easy.

1229
01:26:29,747 --> 01:26:31,791
Shit, Grant!
We shut up or die!

1230
01:26:36,543 --> 01:26:40,546
People are already dying, Syd,
while we we're playing muzak.

1231
01:26:40,546 --> 01:26:44,551
Do we really wanna provide
a genocide with elevator music?

1232
01:26:44,969 --> 01:26:48,512
I don't know what I did up there, Syd,
but I gotta try!

1233
01:26:48,512 --> 01:26:52,475
- Because if I don't... what?
- Okay, okay... it's okay.

1234
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,185
- Yeah!
- Oh, you're killing me, Mazzy.

1235
01:26:55,478 --> 01:26:57,563
Now, get go,
go, go, go, going!

1236
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:03,650
- You there? You there?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

1237
01:27:03,693 --> 01:27:04,985
I'm here,
I'm here, Grant.

1238
01:27:04,985 --> 01:27:05,987
- Hello?
- Grant?

1239
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:07,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm here.

1240
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,822
Okay, we're gonna do what we can.

1241
01:27:08,822 --> 01:27:11,158
Now that French thing,
tha... that French thing, he said, uh...

1242
01:27:11,158 --> 01:27:14,409
he said, uh... terms of endearment
and baby talk, okay?

1243
01:27:14,577 --> 01:27:17,078
And, uh... we got your word, we know
how to clean that one up, right...

1244
01:27:17,078 --> 01:27:18,787
and what was Laurel Ann babbling about?

1245
01:27:18,787 --> 01:27:21,625
- I don't know, I don't remember.
- Oh, well, Ken Logan he was saying,

1246
01:27:21,625 --> 01:27:23,586
uh... 'sample'.
Was that it, 'sample'?

1247
01:27:23,586 --> 01:27:25,378
Okay, we need a list.
Can you make a list?

1248
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:26,671
There is no time for a list, Grant.

1249
01:27:26,671 --> 01:27:29,590
You would only start to confuse people.
What'd you... what do you planning to do?

1250
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:31,466
Okay, put me on,
put me on, come on!

1251
01:27:32,425 --> 01:27:33,635
You're on!

1252
01:27:34,886 --> 01:27:40,182
Hello Pontypool. This is Grant Mazzy here
and today we're taking no prisoners.

1253
01:27:40,182 --> 01:27:44,478
In fact, today folks, we set those
prisoners free.

1254
01:27:44,645 --> 01:27:48,689
So here we go, folks:
"Kill" is "Kiss"

1255
01:27:49,355 --> 01:27:51,775
'Kill' is definitely 'Kiss'...

1256
01:27:51,775 --> 01:27:56,613
Now 'Sample'...
'Sample' is 'Staple'.

1257
01:27:56,613 --> 01:27:58,448
- Sweetheart...
- It's too specific, Grant.

1258
01:27:58,448 --> 01:28:01,408
Sidney Briar!
Are you still alive?

1259
01:28:01,408 --> 01:28:03,911
Listen to me, folks,
everything is something else.

1260
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:05,121
- Okay?
- Sidney Briar! Are you still alive?

1261
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:08,581
If you are sayng "Happy"
it means "Sad"...

1262
01:28:08,581 --> 01:28:12,292
"Happy" means... No, that's the opposite,
it can't be that. Okay, can't be that.

1263
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:15,170
'Happy' is 'Handy'...
'Happy' is 'Handy'.

1264
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:18,716
Move things around, people,
just move it around, just...

1265
01:28:20,341 --> 01:28:27,096
You have to stop understanding...
Stop understanding what you are saying...

1266
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:29,890
Stop understanding
and listen to me...

1267
01:28:30,099 --> 01:28:34,563
"Sample"... "Sample" is a 'Color',
"Sample" is a "Color"...

1268
01:28:34,563 --> 01:28:36,439
Okay, Grant,
you're making sense,

1269
01:28:36,439 --> 01:28:39,983
but if... if you say "don't understand it"
it defeats the purpose.

1270
01:28:40,568 --> 01:28:42,234
Okay, okay,
here we go...

1271
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:48,114
Sidney Briar! Stop the broadcast!
Stop the broadcast!

1272
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,534
The man speaking is sick!

1273
01:28:52,787 --> 01:28:57,914
The "Sky" is a "Person"...
"Laughter" is "Walking".

1274
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:03,587
"Yellow" is "Crowded"...
"Friends" are "Verbs". "Teeth"...

1275
01:29:03,587 --> 01:29:05,213
- Sounds like shitty Haiku, Grant.
- are "Enteric"...

1276
01:29:05,213 --> 01:29:08,006
I may be wrong, Grant, but I don't think
we're saving the world with shitty Haiku!

1277
01:29:08,006 --> 01:29:09,841
Okay, for Christ-sake...
everybody is a critic.

1278
01:29:09,841 --> 01:29:14,221
Help me out here...
"Cling"... "Cling"...

1279
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:15,347
"Intake"...

1280
01:29:15,389 --> 01:29:17,015
- 'Trespass'...
- 'Sniper'...

1281
01:29:17,015 --> 01:29:18,225
- 'Swimming'...
- 'Tomorrow'...

1282
01:29:18,225 --> 01:29:19,766
- 'Fidelity'...
- 'Monologue'...

1283
01:29:19,766 --> 01:29:21,560
- 'Savage'...
- 'Sausage'...

1284
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,645
- Uh... 'Tomorrow'...
- 'Money'...

1285
01:29:23,645 --> 01:29:28,024
- 'Ceiling'...
- Uh... yeah, I don't... Grant...

1286
01:29:28,024 --> 01:29:29,400
'Rhinoceros'...

1287
01:29:29,818 --> 01:29:30,985
'Laughter'...

1288
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:34,447
Shit!

1289
01:29:34,863 --> 01:29:37,948
They're just shooting people, Grant!
They're just killing people!

1290
01:29:39,451 --> 01:29:41,994
Sidney Briar!
Stop the broadcast!

1291
01:29:41,994 --> 01:29:45,913
Stop killing people!
You gotta stop killing people!

1292
01:29:45,913 --> 01:29:51,837
You gotta stop! You gotta stop!
Stop! Stop!

1293
01:30:06,015 --> 01:30:08,100
Just listen to me...

1294
01:30:09,394 --> 01:30:12,813
I said, listen to me...

1295
01:30:14,273 --> 01:30:16,565
I think everyone's dead.

1296
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,198
You're just killing scared people.

1297
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:28,243
It's what you always do.

1298
01:30:28,243 --> 01:30:31,203
You're killing scared people.

1299
01:30:32,162 --> 01:30:37,501
You are like dogs...
You smell fear and you pounce.

1300
01:30:37,501 --> 01:30:40,211
Well, what the fuck happened
today, folks?

1301
01:30:40,252 --> 01:30:42,587
Someone took a buzzsaw
to your middle...

1302
01:30:42,587 --> 01:30:45,173
and they pulled out
a wheeling devil...

1303
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:49,261
and they spilled it
right across your anthill.

1304
01:30:49,761 --> 01:30:51,430
But you know what, friends?

1305
01:30:52,221 --> 01:30:54,472
We were never making sense.

1306
01:30:54,722 --> 01:30:58,435
We were never making sense.

1307
01:30:58,935 --> 01:31:06,609
And today, today when Armageddon
leached out in your good, good mornings...

1308
01:31:06,609 --> 01:31:10,362
You know what?
It's just another day.

1309
01:31:10,654 --> 01:31:13,073
Another day in Pontypool.

1310
01:31:13,113 --> 01:31:16,783
The sun came up.
You did what you did yesterday,

1311
01:31:16,783 --> 01:31:19,996
and it's exactly
what you'll do tomorrow.

1312
01:31:19,996 --> 01:31:22,457
