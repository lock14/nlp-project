1
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
He's clean.

2
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,000
So..

3
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,600
Why are you here? Hm?

4
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,300
<i>There was a time.</i>

5
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,300
4:35.

6
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,399
You misunderstood.

7
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,300
I wasn't asking for the time,
I was just saying, "There was a time."

8
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,100
There was a time?

9
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,799
Mm-hm.

10
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,100
Take brown sugar back there, for example.

11
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
<i>She's pretty fucking foxy, right?</i>

12
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,100
She's 70.

13
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,100
If she's a day.

14
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,700
But there was a time.

15
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,100
- I don't follow.
- The name's Smith. I'm from out of town.

16
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
- Listen, Mr. Smith..
- Just Smith.

17
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,600
The reason I'm in town,
in case you're wondering..

18
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,400
is because of a Kansas City Shuffle.

19
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,000
What's a Kansas City Shuffle?

20
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,500
Kansas City Shuffle is when everybody
looks right and you go left.

21
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,500
- Never heard of it.
- Hm.

22
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,700
It's not something people hear about.

23
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,400
Falls on deaf ears mostly.

24
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,400
But this particular one's
been over 20 years in the making.

25
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,900
<i>20 years, huh?</i>

26
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No small matter.

27
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Requires a lot of planning.

28
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
It involves a lot of people.

29
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,400
People connected only
by the slightest of events.

30
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,400
Like whispers in the night..

31
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,200
in that place that never forgets
even when those people do.

32
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,600
It all starts with a horse.

33
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,800
<i>It's what they called back then
a drugstore handicap.</i>

34
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
<i>A guy wants what the fella calls a sure
thing, so he schemes to make it so.</i>

35
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,138
<i>He calls in the doc, a
nobbler from Antwerp</i>

36
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:36,600
<i>known for his savvy but
not for his discretion.</i>

37
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,100
<i>Oh, fuck me, baby, fuck me, baby.</i>

38
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,300
<i>The same could be said
for Doc's jelly on the side - Gloria.</i>

39
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
- Almost there, almost there.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

40
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,300
Hey, which horse did you say
it was again, baby?

41
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,200
<i>Which brings us to Abe, because Gloria
was too much jelly for one outfit.</i>

42
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,200
Hey, baby, is your wife around?

43
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,500
<i>- What do you want?
- Who is it, Abe?</i>

44
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,100
<i>Ah.. it's Seymour.</i>

45
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,300
<i>Sure, tell that bitch to open her eyes,
maybe then she'd see more.</i>

46
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,300
Seymour says hello.

47
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,900
What are you doing calling me here?

48
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,400
Christmas came early this year, baby.
I got a present for you.

49
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,100
Remember my friend Doc?

50
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,700
<i>Now Abe wasn't a nosy fella,
but he had a nose.</i>

51
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,700
<i>And right below his nose was his mouth.</i>

52
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,699
<i>Do you remember Gloria the hooker?</i>

53
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,400
Well, Gloria's got this friend Doc
who's got a line on a doped-up racehorse.

54
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,499
<i>The fix is in at Aqueduct.</i>

55
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,800
- Seventh horse. Tenth race.
- Doped up?

56
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,500
<i>And then there was this
joker who had ears..</i>

57
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,900
<i>Let's get back.</i>

58
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,200
<i>Who looked like somebody's uncle.</i>

59
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,299
Max, who's your favorite uncle?

60
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,500
OK, who's your second favorite uncle?

61
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,300
Just pay attention.

62
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,200
I got something here.

63
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,900
<i>And before you know it, folks are
getting a big dose of the gimmies,</i>

64
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
<i>and men start talking their hats off.</i>

65
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,788
<i>And that Manischewitz
Grapevine Wine spills in</i>

66
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:09,100
<i>your ear and tells you,
you got a sure thing,</i>

67
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,600
<i>and what's worse is, you
start to believe it.</i>

68
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,500
<i>At least that's how it went with old Max,</i>

69
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
<i>who wasn't so much old, as he was tired.</i>

70
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,400
<i>Tired of being a dog without a day.</i>

71
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,800
<i>Tired of waking up and finding
that his dreams were only dreams.</i>

72
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,100
We're leaving.

73
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,700
<i>But mostly,
Max was tired of not having a front lawn.</i>

74
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,700
Make sure he doesn't come home late.

75
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,100
- I will.
- I was talking to your son.

76
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,500
- You think that's funny, do you?

77
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Uh-huh. Bye, Mom.

78
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,500
Yeah. Bye, Mom!

79
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,800
Love you.

80
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,100
<i>They're off.</i>

81
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,100
All right, if your ma asks,
where were we today?

82
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,599
- Shea Stadium.
- To see?

83
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,500
- Mets v Phillies.
- Good man. Give me the post-game.

84
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,200
Stallard gave up six runs
in the first five innings.

85
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,388
Ed Kranepool hit a
line drive down right

86
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:03,500
field but it hit the
wall, fouled by a foot.

87
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
Gonder hit a groundball
between first and second

88
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,100
but he's so slow, second baseman
Tony Taylor tagged him out at first.

89
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,300
Did you get all that from the radio?

90
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,599
Mm -hm.

91
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
You're good.

92
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,199
OK, I'll be right back.

93
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,500
No, no, no. You've got to stay in the car.

94
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,199
Why?

95
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,100
Because they don't let little
boys inside the track.

96
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Saul's dad takes him to the track.

97
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,100
Well, Saul's dad is a degenerate gambler.

98
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,500
And if you're the son of a
degenerate gambler, they let you in.

99
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,500
It's economically viable.

100
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,800
Are you going to be a degenerate gambler?

101
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,000
Hey. You know better than that.

102
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,000
Your old man's smart.
He only plays a sure thing.

103
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,600
Look. This money's gonna
get you through Harvard.

104
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,400
And you're gonna be a doctor.

105
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,800
But until then..

106
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,800
you've got to stay in the car.

107
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,000
Hey.

108
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,000
Next weekend, you and me go to a ballgame.

109
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,800
- OK.
- OK.

110
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,600
I love you, kid.

111
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,300
I love you too, Dad.

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,900
Wait, watch. Watch, watch, watch.

113
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I almost forgot. 15 minutes.

114
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,000
Start counting.

115
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,100
<i>The next race at the
Aqueduct is the tenth race.</i>

116
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,800
<i>- Come on, come on.
- The field is making towards</i>

117
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,300
<i>the final turn, and Number Seven has moved
into fifth position on the outside.</i>

118
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,700
<i>- Number Two has the lead..</i>

119
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,400
Come on.

120
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,299
<i>Number One is against the rail.</i>

121
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,100
<i>And Number Seven is beginning
to pick up the pace on the outside.</i>

122
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,299
Yes!

123
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,100
<i>Yes, come on, baby, come on!</i>

124
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,200
- Let's go!

125
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,800
<i>To challenge, goes clear
and Number Seven takes the lead!</i>

126
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,800
<i>It's Number Seven who now has the lead.</i>

127
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,000
<i>It's strolling clear.</i>

128
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes!

129
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,100
Oh!

130
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
<i>Number Seven has fallen!</i>

131
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,300
<i>Number One comes home
and takes the lead to win it.</i>

132
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,699
<i>Max woke up to find his dreams
had just been the stuff of pipes.</i>

133
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
- I want to place a bet.
- How much?

134
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
20 large.

135
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Oh, you must feel real lucky.

136
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,900
<i>I'll take your bet.</i>

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
And lay it off.

138
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,500
I've got a bookie's bookie.

139
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,300
I'll give you 2-1 on the horse.

140
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,000
Uh-uh. The racing form says 9-1.

141
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,900
So you go to a ticket vendor
with your 20 grand in hand,

142
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,800
and you get 9-1 if the spread sticks.

143
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,500
You come in here with your
pockets turned out, you get 2-1.

144
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,800
The juice is ten.

145
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,100
That means if you lose,
you're all in for 22 grand.

146
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
20 for the bet, two for the juice.

147
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,700
Can you pay these monies? Huh? Can you?

148
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
Yeah.

149
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,400
<i>Just to be clear,</i>

150
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,100
<i>if you lose..</i>

151
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,999
you're gonna owe a lot of money
to the kind of men

152
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to.

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,500
Henry!

154
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,700
Henry!

155
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Henry!

156
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,900
Henry!

157
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,500
Hey, buddy. You got a light?

158
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,599
No. Henry!

159
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,900
In that case, how about the 20 Gs
you just blew on the Seven horse?

160
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,100
- What have you done with my son?
- He's on his way home. Just like you.

161
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,100
Urgh!

162
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,300
Where am I?

163
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,500
Roth, he'll tell you everything, I swear.

164
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
He already has.

165
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,100
Please.

166
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I have a family.

167
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
<i>Please.</i>

168
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,800
<i>Please!</i>

169
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,500
<i>Where's my boy?</i>

170
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,100
<i>Henry!</i>

171
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,000
<i>Where are they?</i>

172
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,100
<i>Henry!</i>

173
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,600
<i>Henry!</i>

174
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,900
Fuck.

175
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,400
Shit.

176
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,900
Jesus.

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,900
"Fuck, shit, Jesus" is right.

178
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,900
I don't understand.
Why did they kill Max's family?

179
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,800
New outfit in town.

180
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,000
They didn't want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them.

181
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,300
Trying to make an impression.

182
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
That's a fucking story, man.

183
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,300
Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin
look-a-like contest in Monte Carlo

184
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
and came in third.

185
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,400
Now that's a story.

186
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
This..

187
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,500
This is something else.

188
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
So that's a Kansas City Shuffle?

189
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,000
No.

190
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,000
It's just the inciting incident.

191
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,000
The catalyst.

192
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,200
This - is a Kansas City Shuffle.

193
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,500
<i>They look right..</i>

194
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,700
And you..

195
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,700
go left.

196
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Sorry about that, son.

197
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,300
Sometimes there's more to
life than just living.

198
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,700
Besides.. you can't have a Kansas
City Shuffle without a body.

199
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
<i>- He's down!
- Get the roof!</i>

200
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,100
<i>Up there!</i>

201
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,700
I'm coming!

202
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,400
Coming.

203
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,100
It took you long enough.

204
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,600
You're not Nick.

205
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,000
You're not as tall as I thought you'd be.

206
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Well, I'm short for my height.

207
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,400
That makes sense because I can usually
tell how tall someone is by their knock.

208
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,500
You have a deceptively tall knock.
Congratulations.

209
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,900
So it's a good thing?

210
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,000
I open the door expecting you to
be up here, you're down here.

211
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,300
That combined with a low centre
of gravity - forget about it.

212
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,100
Who are you?

213
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
I'm Slevin.

214
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
And what happened to your nose?

215
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,700
I was using it to break some guy's fist.

216
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,700
Somebody hit you?

217
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,900
Yeah.. I was kind of
expecting it, though.

218
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
You were kind of expecting it?

219
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,000
Well, they say bad
things happen in threes.

220
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,500
<i>First.. I lost my job.</i>

221
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,800
<i>Then I came home to find
my apartment building had been condemned</i>

222
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,400
<i>due to a hybrid breed
of Ecuadorian Super Termites.</i>

223
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
<i>So I went to my girlfriend Kelly's.</i>

224
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
<i>I had a key so I let myself in.</i>

225
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,700
- Hey, don't stop on my account.
- Oh shit!

226
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,400
Slevin.

227
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,300
It was an accident.

228
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,900
What, like he tripped and you fell?

229
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
<i>Slevin, do you know what time it is?</i>

230
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,400
I'm at the airport,
are you sure you want me to come out?

231
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,700
<i>Yeah, two weeks in New York
and the only Kelly you'll remember</i>

232
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,400
<i>is the Kelly who gave you your first
hand job on the bus to summer camp.</i>

233
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,300
Kelly Perkins. Said her hands were dry
and she needed..

234
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,900
<i>She said that to a lot of guys,
that's why we called her Jerkins Perkins.</i>

235
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,600
<i>- Just call me when you land, all right?
- Yeah.</i>

236
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
Yeah, I just got into town, Nick.
I'm on my way over to your place.

237
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,600
Say, man, you got the time?

238
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,900
Ya, man, it's uh.. 7:23.

239
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,900
So you're probably still asleep?

240
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,500
- Yo, you got a smoke?
- No, I don't smoke, man.

241
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,800
<i>Why don't you just go ahead and give me
your wallet and I'll buy my own smokes?</i>

242
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,400
Am I being mugged?

243
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Man!

244
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
And so here I am.

245
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,500
You said three.

246
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,800
- What?
- You said bad things happen in threes.

247
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,600
You lost your job, your apartment was
condemned, Kelly was cheating on you

248
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,500
<i>and you got mugged - that makes four.</i>

249
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
When you're on a roll, you're on a roll.

250
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,300
Interesting, although I would add,

251
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,100
not the ever so clever hold-up man
one hears so much about.

252
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,399
- Well, he did break my nose.
- But overlooked your suitcase.

253
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,500
Maybe it wouldn't make
for a speedy getaway.

254
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,599
True, but then there's the matter
of your watch. Pretty fancy.

255
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,500
- It's a fake.
- But he didn't know that.

256
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,300
- Maybe he didn't see it.
- He saw it. He asked you for the time.

257
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,300
You say this was your third mugging?

258
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,999
Uh.. I travel a lot.

259
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Where's Nick?

260
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,999
I don't know. He was supposed to
meet me here. He never showed up.

261
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,900
<i>- How did you get in?
- Door was open.</i>

262
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,100
- Door was open?
- Yeah.

263
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,300
- Open or unlocked?
- I don't remember.

264
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,888
You said open.

265
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,399
Could have been. What
was your name again?

266
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Lindsey. I live across the hall.

267
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,700
- Oh.
- I came over to borrow a cup of sugar.

268
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,100
<i>- Where's your cup?
- I came to borrow a cup of sugar.</i>

269
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,300
If I had a cup, I'd have
come to borrow sugar.

270
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
- Touché.

271
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,500
Maybe that's Nick. It's right there.

272
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Hello?

273
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,100
Hello?

274
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,000
They hung up.

275
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,400
I have an idea. Have you used the phone
since you've been here?

276
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,400
No, except for that.

277
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,800
Sorry, wrong number.

278
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,600
That was the Hotel Cheval.

279
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,500
What are you doing?

280
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,400
We know who he called. Who called him?

281
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,700
- Columbo says three things..
- Columbo?

282
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, Columbo was this TV detective
played by Peter Falk..

283
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,300
I know who Columbo is. Yeah.

284
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,300
He looked for three
things at a crime scene.

285
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,700
What's there now that wasn't before.
What was there before that isn't now.

286
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,000
- And what's been moved.
- Is this a crime scene?

287
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,000
- I think Nick's in trouble.
- Ah.

288
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,400
Sorry, wrong number.

289
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,499
That was the Hotel Cheval again!

290
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,200
So what? He called the hotel,
the hotel called him back. Makes sense.

291
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,700
So, maybe it's a clue.

292
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,000
- A clue to what?
- A clue to what happened to Nick.

293
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,300
<i>- We don't know anything did.
- We don't know anything didn't.</i>

294
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,700
You're here, he's not. The door was open.
Bad things happen where you..

295
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,700
Shit. I've got to stop by work.

296
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,638
Just for a couple of hours.
I'll come back,

297
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,500
then we can start
the investigation.

298
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,900
- The investigation?
- Uh-huh. It'll be fun.

299
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,800
OK.

300
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
I totally forgot..

301
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,400
Yeah.

302
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Sorry.

303
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,700
- May I borrow a cup of sugar?
- What?

304
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,400
<i>I never gave it much thought
until I put up a fresh pot of coffee.</i>

305
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,200
I was on my way to the store
and I thought Nick'd have sugar.

306
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,700
You tell me your story,
I leave, sugarless.

307
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,900
I come back, you put your
penis on exhibition.

308
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,800
Although the coffee's probably gone bad
by now, I insist on following through.

309
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,100
It's like a Norman Rockwell painting.

310
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,300
What, my penis?

311
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,899
No. No, the sugar.

312
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,500
<i>Neighbors borrowing
sugar from one another.</i>

313
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,400
It's very um.. Andy Griffith.

314
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Yeah.

315
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,100
<i>That's Andy Griffith.
The penis thing is not very Mayberry.</i>

316
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,700
No.

317
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Thanks for the sugar.. sugar.

318
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,100
I wanted to try and catch the next show.

319
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,700
I don't go on again till eight.

320
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,300
Whew!

321
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
It's not nearly eight o'clock yet.

322
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,200
- The Boss wants to see you.
- Who..?

323
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,100
- The Boss.
- Who's The Boss?

324
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,300
- The guy we work for.
- Jesus!

325
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,300
Come here and sit your punk ass down.

326
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,300
Go.

327
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,200
I'm not the guy you're looking for.
I don't live here.

328
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
Well, you look like the
guy that lives here.

329
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,700
Then you don't know what he looks like.

330
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,700
He means to say you look
like you live here.

331
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,900
Yeah, that's what I mean to say.

332
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,900
I look like I live here, but I don't.

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,500
I'm just visiting, I just
got in this morning.

334
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,800
The cat I'm looking for, his name is uh..

335
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,200
- His name is Nick, man.
- Nick.

336
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
The cat's name is Nick. Now..

337
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,400
Who are you?

338
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,800
I'm Slevin.

339
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,200
You got some ID?

340
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,800
The funny thing about that is
I got mugged this morning.

341
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,400
Look, look.

342
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,300
Tell it to the One Legged Man.

343
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,300
So he can bump it off down the road.

344
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,999
- Hey, listen, motherfucker..
- Yo, I got this.

345
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
- Slow, slow, slow, slow your roll, man.
- I got this.

346
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,700
Just let me. Just let me, all right?

347
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,600
Motherfucker!

348
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,600
All I know is,
The Boss slides me this here address,

349
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,600
and he says, "Sloe" - that's him.

350
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,299
"Elvis" - that's me.

351
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,800
"Bring me the cat
who resides at this here address."

352
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,400
Now he told me that today.

353
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,900
You just so happen to be here today.

354
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,100
So I guess you the cat
I'm supposed to pick up.

355
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Today.

356
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,500
But I'm not Nick.

357
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,300
Yeah, well, unfortunately for you,

358
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,500
you're not the first cat to tell me
you wasn't the guy I was looking for.

359
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,200
You can ask Lindsey, she lives
across the hall. She lives here.

360
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,500
Hold on, man, I ain't
asking nobody nothing.

361
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,000
Nick, Slevin, Clark Kent -
whatever your name is.

362
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,900
The Virgin Mary could come waltzing up
with her fine ass,

363
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,700
titties hanging out and everything.

364
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,088
If she told me your name
was Jesus Christ, I

365
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:17,400
still gotta take you to see The Boss.
Know why?

366
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,400
No.

367
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Orders.

368
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,800
Now, you do know what orders is, right?

369
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,100
<i>Orders is orders.</i>

370
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,388
So I guess no-one ever
taught you not to use

371
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,700
the word you're defining
in the definition?

372
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,100
Say something else, I will break
your motherfucking nose. I ain't playing.

373
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,800
My nose is already broken.

374
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
<i>- Can I just say one more thing?
- What?</i>

375
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,899
Can you turn the heat up in here
cos it's really cold?

376
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,499
Uh.. yeah.

377
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Y-You.. You should have thought about that
before you started in with all the lip.

378
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,700
Ah, Jeez.

379
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
- It's cold out there.
- Let's hurry it up, man.

380
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,300
Yo, grab his ass.

381
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
<i>The boss is right up there, chump.</i>

382
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,900
Well, listen.

383
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,700
Your boys Elvis and Sloe
picked up the wrong guy.

384
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
<i>- I'm not Nick Fisher.
- Mr. Fisher?</i>

385
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,900
Are you familiar with
The Shmoo, Mr. Fisher?

386
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
A comic strip I liked as a boy.

387
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,999
The Shmoo was a loveable creature, really.

388
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,800
<i>Laid eggs..</i>

389
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,500
gave milk..

390
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,600
and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger.

391
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,599
The Shmoo loved to be eaten.

392
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,800
It could taste like any food you desire.

393
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,200
Shmoo hide, cut thin, made fine leather.

394
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,600
<i>Even Shmoo whiskers
made excellent toothpicks.</i>

395
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,200
In essence, the Shmoo supplied
all of the world's wants.

396
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,938
I only bring up the
Shmoo because it's

397
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:17,200
relevant to you and why
you were brought here.

398
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,600
I'm sorry, who are you?

399
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,100
I'm The Boss.

400
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,900
I thought he was The Boss.

401
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Why?

402
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,000
Do we look alike?

403
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,100
So, Mr. Fisher..
you were gonna tell me something?

404
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,100
I don't know, you brought me here.

405
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,500
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

406
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Back when you thought I was him.

407
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,699
I never thought you were him.
I thought he was you.

408
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,700
I was trying to tell him, you..
that they picked up the wrong guy.

409
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,200
- Wrong guy for what?
- What you wanted to see me about.

410
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,200
- Know what I wanted to see you about?
- No.

411
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
Then how do you know I have the wrong guy?

412
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,500
- Because I'm not..
- Maybe I wanted to give you $96,000.

413
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
In that case, do I still
have the wrong guy?

414
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,900
Do you want to give me $96,000?

415
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,900
<i>No, do you want to give me $96,000?</i>

416
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,400
No, should I?

417
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,400
I don't know, should you?

418
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
I don't know, should I?

419
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,300
Long story short.

420
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,188
I think we're well
past that point.

421
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:20,200
I'll bet it was that mouth
that got you that nose.

422
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,588
OK, I'm under the
impression that you're

423
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:27,900
under the impression
that I owe you $96,000.

424
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,400
No, you owe Slim Hopkins $96,000.

425
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
You owe Slim, Slim owes me.

426
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,500
You owe me.

427
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
<i>Well, in that case, is Slim around?</i>

428
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,400
Hey, Slim. Do you know this cat?

429
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Slim?

430
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,800
No use.

431
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,000
Ever since somebody shot him,
old Slim went deaf.

432
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,000
What happened to make Slim go deaf?

433
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,300
Why?

434
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,500
Because I owe you $96,000 and I might have
a slight problem coming up with the money.

435
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh, OK.

436
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,400
Well, why don't we just
make it an even 90?

437
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,600
I may have exaggerated the slightness.

438
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Hm.

439
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,900
Well, why don't I just cancel the whole
debt in exchange for a small favor?

440
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Well, that depends on the favor.

441
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,100
<i>That was my son.</i>

442
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Notice how I said "was"?

443
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,999
Yeah.

444
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
That's because he's dead.

445
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Murdered.

446
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
Relegated to the past tense.

447
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,400
<i>Sent from an is to a was
before he'd had his breakfast.</i>

448
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,200
Bummer.

449
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,500
Lex Talionis.

450
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,900
The Law of Retaliation.

451
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
<i>A pact was broken.</i>

452
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,600
My son was murdered, so The Rabbi's
son must share the same fate.

453
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,100
Whose son?

454
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,800
The Rabbi's.

455
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,800
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

456
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,200
Because..

457
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,599
Because he's a rabbi.

458
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Who's his son?

459
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,200
- Yitzchok.
- Yitzchok. Yitzchok and The Rabbi.

460
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Yitzchok the Fairy.

461
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,600
Why do they call him The Fairy?

462
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,800
Because he's a fairy.

463
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,200
He has wings, can fly?
Sprinkles magic dust all over the place?

464
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,200
- He's homosexual.
- Right.

465
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Come on.

466
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,000
- So how does The Rabbi feel about that?
- He doesn't know.

467
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,200
- You know, but he doesn't?
- Everybody knows.

468
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,100
- Except The Rabbi.
- That's right.

469
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,899
So where do I fit in?

470
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,500
You?

471
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
You're the trigger man.

472
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,700
Me?

473
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,600
You.

474
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,200
Aren't there professionals? People you
can hire to do this sort of thing?

475
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,900
Of course there are.

476
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,900
Yes.

477
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,900
But you owe me $96,000.

478
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Why should I go out and pay someone else
when I've already paid you?

479
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:58,000
Hm. Sorry, kid,
but your money just isn't long enough.

480
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,600
Which means you're in my pocket.

481
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,300
Which means
if you don't do what I want you to do,

482
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,900
you're gonna go from my
pocket to my fridge.

483
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,800
Slim could use the company.

484
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,700
I could use the Shmoo.

485
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,900
So I'll expect your answer by morning.

486
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Is there anything else?

487
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,699
Well, I don't suppose I have to say
anything as trite and clichéd as,

488
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,899
"Go to the police and you're a dead man."

489
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,200
I think you just did.

490
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,700
I guess I did.

491
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,200
So, let me see if I've got this right.

492
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,138
I'm paying you a lot of
money to kill somebody

493
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:40,500
and you're getting
somebody else to do it?

494
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,500
Don't worry.

495
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,500
I'm gonna kill somebody.

496
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,400
Better call Brikowski.

497
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,000
Tell him there's a new face in town.

498
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,200
- Hey.
- Nick still hasn't shown, huh?

499
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,199
- No.
- What's with you and that towel?

500
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,800
Oh.. Lindsey..

501
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,288
It's a very long story.

502
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:41,999
Get dressed, and tell
me about it on the way.

503
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,300
Where are we going?

504
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,200
All we know is that somebody called Nick
from the Hotel Cheval.

505
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,300
<i>I spoke to a friend who works there.</i>

506
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,300
<i>They keep a record of every call made.</i>

507
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,700
<i>She can access the computer and we can
find out what room the call came from.</i>

508
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,400
What is it?

509
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,400
<i>- I know this guy.
- Who?</i>

510
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,900
This guy.

511
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
You know that guy?

512
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,300
Yeah, I met him.

513
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,700
He was dead.

514
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,100
You met a dead guy?

515
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,199
Yeah.

516
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
In a walk-in freezer.

517
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,800
Bookmaker Slim Hopkins reported missing.
Police have no leads.

518
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,400
Blah, blah, blah. Yada, yada..

519
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,400
A spokesperson commented off the record,
"Ironic that Hopkins should go missing,

520
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,100
considering he's allegedly been behind
a few disappearing acts himself."

521
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,300
I think it's time you told me that story
about why you're still wearing that towel.

522
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,700
- Do you mind if I get dressed first?

523
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,500
Could be my friend from the hotel.
Be right back.

524
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,500
Hm.

525
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,400
Hey, Lindsey, I don't think it's such
a good idea that we continue to..

526
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,500
Put your shoes on, Schlomo
wants to see you.

527
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,000
I don't know anyone named Schlomo.

528
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,500
Someone named Schlomo knows you.
That is your only concern.

529
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,000
Let's go.

530
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,800
Like I said, I don't know..

531
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
Aaahh.. better..

532
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,100
I think it's better if you
let me do the talking.

533
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,700
You think?

534
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,100
What is it?

535
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,499
He's sorry that he hit you.

536
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
<i>- Do you always speak for him?
- Yes.</i>

537
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,299
Hm.

538
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,300
So, he's a mute, then.

539
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,300
Not quite.

540
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Well, what, then?

541
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,900
It's personal. You'll have to ask him.

542
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
- Hm. How would he tell me?
- He wouldn't.

543
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,700
- Hey, are we going to the..?
- No.

544
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,100
- But he's right there.
- A different outfit entirely.

545
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,400
<i>Right across the street from one another?</i>

546
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,588
At one time they were
one with one another.

547
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:13,700
And then they tried
to kill one another.

548
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:19,200
<i>And now neither man leaves
his respective tower of isolation</i>

549
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,600
for fear of what the other
man will do to him.

550
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Let me guess, all the way up?

551
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Penthouse.

552
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,300
Gentle piano music

553
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,900
You must be Mr. Fisher.

554
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,300
Must I? Because.. that hasn't been
working out for me lately.

555
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,000
- But I'm afraid you must.
- Well, if I must.

556
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,600
Do you know for what reason
you've been brought here?

557
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,800
For starters, I'm unlucky.

558
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,799
The unlucky are nothing more than a frame
of reference for the lucky, Mr. Fisher.

559
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,600
You are unlucky so I may
know that I am not.

560
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,100
Unfortunately, the lucky never realize
they are lucky until it's too late.

561
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,700
Take yourself for instance. Yesterday
you were better off than you are today,

562
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,338
but it took today for you
to realize it. But..

563
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,900
today has arrived, and
it's too late, you see?

564
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,300
<i>People are never happy
with what they have.</i>

565
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,700
They always want what they had,
or what someone else has.

566
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,100
Kinda like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster,

567
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,100
a gangster who would rather be a rabbi.

568
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
I mean, what is that?

569
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,399
Some sort of grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing?

570
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,600
<i>I mean, how do you justify being a rabbi</i>

571
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,800
and a gangster?

572
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,200
I don't.

573
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,300
I'm a bad man who doesn't waste time
wondering what could've been,

574
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
when I am what could've
been or not have been.

575
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,100
I live on both sides of the fence,
and my grass is always green.

576
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
Consider, Mr. Fisher..

577
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,200
there are two men
sitting here before you,

578
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,738
and one of them you
should be very afraid of.

579
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,200
Where's my money?

580
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,200
- I've been hearing that a lot lately.
- My father used to say,

581
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,800
"The first time somebody calls
you a horse, you punch him."

582
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,600
The second time somebody calls
you a horse, call him a jerk.

583
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,738
"But the third time
somebody calls you a horse,

584
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,800
perhaps it's time to go
shopping for a saddle."

585
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,888
I don't have your money.

586
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:53,700
This isn't like skipping
out on the check.

587
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,100
You owe me money.
I have interests, you owe them money.

588
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,588
I don't even know how
much money I owe you.

589
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:00,000
$33,000.

590
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,400
- But I'm not Nick fisher.
- Then who the hell are you?

591
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,600
I'm just a guy who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

592
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,800
You have 48 hours to get my money.

593
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,100
Saul will keep an eye on you.
In the meantime, you may go now.

594
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,500
Wait, I just have one question.

595
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,000
I wasn't frisked.

596
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,299
I see. So, being a rabbi, a..
a religious man..

597
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,500
There are three things a Jew may not do in
order to save a life, including his own.

598
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,400
He may not idol-worship, commit adultery,
or perform an act of premeditated murder.

599
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,400
Killing you before you killed me
would have been..

600
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
- Kosher.

601
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
Acceptable.

602
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,900
I've wired half the money
to your bank in the Caymans.

603
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,199
The other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground.

604
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Now I can expect that when?

605
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,700
- Very soon.
- Good.

606
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,400
So, tell me. The kid..

607
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
<i>What do you want with him?</i>

608
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,400
The kid and I have unfinished business.

609
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,700
If there's one thing I know,
it's when someone is lying.

610
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,900
A man in my position,
it's all he has to go on.

611
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,900
To know a lie when he hears it, it's the
difference between life and death -

612
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,600
your own, someone else's.

613
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,700
That being said, he wasn't lying.

614
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,200
That's not Nick Fisher.

615
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,400
I know.

616
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,838
I came back here, you were gone.
So, I went

617
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:20,000
to the hotel without
you to see my friend.

618
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,999
She says the call to Nick
came from Room 1009.

619
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,700
A fellow registered under the name
of Smith, if you can believe that.

620
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,638
It's one of the most
common names in the

621
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:30,500
world, so there's bound
to be a couple of 'em.

622
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,799
But I get the feeling that
this ain't one of 'em.

623
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,799
I get up to the tenth
floor, and just as I do,

624
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,600
the door to room 1009 opens
and there's our Mr. Smith. In the flesh.

625
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,038
So, I pretend I'm walking
to the elevator instead

626
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:44,400
of coming from it and we
take it down together.

627
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
He smiles at me - thanks - I smile back.

628
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,800
<i>But I have no idea who he is
but I think you might,</i>

629
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,100
<i>so I take a picture using my cell phone
which I thought was a total waste</i>

630
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,600
cos the photos look like
shit and I never use it.

631
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,188
So there I am pretending
to dial a number, and

632
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,700
taking Smith's picture
- him none the wiser.

633
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,600
This is Smith. Recognize him?

634
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,400
No.

635
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,538
I didn't think you would,
but it was worth a shot.

636
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,800
Anyway, we take the
elevator to the lobby,

637
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,600
and the man who calls himself Smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab.

638
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,500
So I followed him.

639
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
<i>He went down
into an apartment building downtown.</i>

640
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,100
<i>So I wait. An hour goes by.</i>

641
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,400
And just when I'm getting ready to leave -
who walks outside?

642
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,200
- Smith?
- You.

643
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,400
Me?

644
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,300
<i>You out of the same building with two
Hasidic Jews on either side of you.</i>

645
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,100
Friends of yours?

646
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,499
Not exactly.

647
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,700
I think it's time you told me that story.

648
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,100
Well, there's this guy
and they call him The Boss, right?

649
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,499
And then, right across the street
there's this man they call The Rabbi.

650
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,600
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

651
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,000
So now I have to "take out",
to use the vernacular,

652
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,899
The Fairy, in order to scratch a debt
that isn't even mine.

653
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,688
And if that's not enough,
I have 48 hours to

654
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:21,500
come up with $33,000
or The Rabbi's gonna..

655
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
I don't know who Mr. Smith is.

656
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,200
And the worst part about it is,
I'm not Nick Fisher.

657
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,700
Ironic.

658
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,300
I know, I don't even gamble.

659
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,500
No, I mean the mobster having a gay son.
That's ironic.

660
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,099
We are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here.

661
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,988
Things like that aren't
supposed to be real.

662
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:44,899
It's like amnesia.

663
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,100
Notwithstanding, here you are,
and Nick's nowhere to be found, so..

664
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,300
I'd say you're fucked.

665
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,300
Fucked.

666
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,900
Shouldn't you be a little
worried about this?

667
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,200
I have Ataraxia.

668
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,400
Ataraxia?

669
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,988
It's a condition
characterized by freedom

670
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:08,500
from worry or any other
preoccupation really.

671
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,000
I have to have my answer
to The Boss in the morning.

672
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,100
Oh, what are you gonna say?

673
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,000
What a man with two penises would say
when his tailor asks him

674
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,288
if he dresses to the
right or to the left.

675
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,500
What's that?

676
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,000
Yes.

677
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,900
I knew you had sense.

678
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,200
Sense is something you have
when you have a choice.

679
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,000
Sometimes.

680
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,500
Sometimes it's when you know you don't.

681
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,400
Nah, don't move that bishop!
It's an obvious sucker bet.

682
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,600
If you don't, y-y-you can
have him in four moves.

683
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,000
If you do, he's gonna
have you in mate in one.

684
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,400
He doesn't see it.

685
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,000
Wouldn't matter if he did.

686
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,600
Elvis lets me win.

687
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,800
<i>Everybody lets me win.</i>

688
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,400
Wait a minute. You know this game?

689
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,100
You got three days.

690
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,599
I was thinking it would take me a week.

691
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh, you were thinking that, were you?

692
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,200
With all your experience killing people?
I'll tell you what.

693
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,200
You win this game, you got your week.

694
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,200
Hm.

695
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,100
So, what's the plan with Yitzchok?

696
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,299
Was gonna play it by ear.

697
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,400
Well, if it's all the same,
I'd write it down. It's a tough tune.

698
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,800
And, by the way, he has shadows.

699
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,300
Shadows?

700
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,900
Bodyguards.

701
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,600
With him all the time.

702
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,200
Military.

703
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,000
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

704
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,300
They go where he goes,
round-the-clock. Ex-Israeli Mossad.

705
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,300
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

706
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,000
That doesn't sound good.

707
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,300
<i>They live in the apartment next door.</i>

708
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,400
He wears a panic button on a chain
around his neck.

709
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
<i>Looks like an ordinary Star of David.</i>

710
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,600
He presses that button
and, well, we all know how that ends.

711
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,100
What's this?

712
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,300
Oh, God! No, you didn't?

713
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,900
- Get down!

714
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,700
<i>Response time's gonna be
three to five seconds.</i>

715
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,699
He's gonna have to hit him
when he least expects it.

716
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,700
Where?

717
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,500
- Where?
- The apartment.

718
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,400
How do I get in his apartment?
I can't just walk in the front door.

719
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,400
No, I was thinking you'd
use the back door.

720
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,699
Then what?

721
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,900
He does the kid, I do him.

722
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,299
I plant my gun. Clean, no history.

723
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,300
And Yitzchok - fire a round,
get some powder burns on the hands.

724
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,200
Take the clothes off-make it look like a,

725
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,538
"You do me, I do you,
we're both gay, the

726
00:48:34,551 --> 00:48:36,800
world doesn't understand
us," double suicide.

727
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,900
And that's all there is to it.

728
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Is that all there is to it?

729
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,500
Yeah. It's all there is to it.

730
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,000
Peww!

731
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,900
I'm not such a bad guy, you know.

732
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,700
<i>Some folks have grown pretty fat off me.</i>

733
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,300
Some have grown pretty dead.

734
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,100
You're a conundrum, you.

735
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,588
You walk in here shooting
your fucking mouth off

736
00:49:18,601 --> 00:49:20,800
like you don't give a
fuck if it gets shot off.

737
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,400
You can only kill me once.

738
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,800
Checkmate.

739
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,000
Nobody says I have to kill you quick.

740
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,000
Cat.

741
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,800
Mouse.

742
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,400
You've got three days.

743
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,200
Excuse me.

744
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,700
Who the fuck is this guy?

745
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,000
<i>Dunno. But whoever he is, he's either in
very deep shit or I don't know what,</i>

746
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,388
because he's playing in
the sandbox with the

747
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:27,700
Darkies, the Skullcaps
and who knows who.

748
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,700
Call Murph and see if he got a match
on that photo Marty snapped.

749
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,800
Yes, boss.

750
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,100
I want a complete rundown on this fucker.
Everything from A to Z.

751
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,100
Who he is. Who does he know?
The people he knows, who do they know?

752
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,500
I want to know what the fuck he
is doing in my fucking city.

753
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,700
- What have you got?
- Get this.

754
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,200
The Kat's in town.

755
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,400
Good Kat?

756
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,099
- It's the song junkies are singing.
- What's the happenstance?

757
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,299
Didn't know the happenstance.
Just said the word was the Kat's in town.

758
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,500
Um.. who's er.. who's Good Kat?

759
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,100
<i>Real heavy hitter.</i>

760
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,100
- The heaviest.
- He shows, people die, he vanishes.

761
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,600
No-one knows who he is,
or what he looks like.

762
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,599
And he hasn't worked New York
in, like, two decades.

763
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,600
<i>Just what we need.</i>

764
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,800
All right.

765
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,038
And get some different fucking
coffee in here, will you?

766
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:26,500
I gotta get to the
fucking morgue.

767
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,100
- Hey! I figured it out.
- Hey. What did you figure out?

768
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,700
You said that Slim Hopkins worked
for The Boss, right?

769
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,500
Well, listen.

770
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,400
The Rabbi also had a bookie - Benny Begin.

771
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,100
Benny's at the morgue.
Somebody killed him and his goons.

772
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,400
- The morgue?
- Didn't I say I was a coroner?

773
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,100
No, you didn't say you were a coroner.

774
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,000
Benny Begin - killed by a baseball.

775
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,500
My guess was a fastball.

776
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,400
Well, either way it proves
that the good Lord has a sense of humor.

777
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,200
- Good morning, Detective.
- Morning.

778
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,400
- You know this guy?
- Big-time bookie. Worked for The Rabbi.

779
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,300
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

780
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,200
Between you and me..

781
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,700
20 years ago he used to be my bookie.
I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.

782
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,600
What about the other two?
Did you get anything on them yet?

783
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,500
These two were poisoned.

784
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,000
Something exotic.

785
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,300
- I'm running it down.
- Well, let me know.

786
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,200
<i>Will do.</i>

787
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,700
Prick.

788
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,200
- Have a good day.
- You too, Detective.

789
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,600
Jimmy, I'm taking my lunch break.

790
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,700
Don't you see? Nick isn't missing,
he's hiding. He set you up.

791
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,600
- Nick set me up?
- Like a bowling pin.

792
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,100
Nick found himself in a jam.
He got you to take his place.

793
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,700
He paid a street thug to mug you, but
all he wants is your wallet and license

794
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,600
<i>so he ignores the watch and suitcase.</i>

795
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,400
<i>Then Nick kills Slim Hopkins and Benny,</i>

796
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,900
the only guys who know what he looks like,
and now you're left holding the bag!

797
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,600
- But I called Nick. I initiated contact.
- Well, maybe it just seems that way.

798
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,988
What about Smith?

799
00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:10,300
I still can't figure
him out in all this.

800
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,700
Hm.

801
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,100
- You should run.
- I can't.

802
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,900
- They'll kill you if you stay.
- They'll kill me if I leave.

803
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,438
Go to the police!

804
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:19,899
These guys buy cops
like cops buy doughnuts.

805
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,900
This isn't the first
time this has happened.

806
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,300
This isn't the first time a crime lord
asked you to kill the gay son of a rival

807
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,188
to pay off a friend's
debt whose place

808
00:53:27,201 --> 00:53:29,000
you're staying in because
you lost your job

809
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,000
and found your girlfriend
with another guy?

810
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,388
It is the first time it happened.
But Nick has

811
00:53:33,401 --> 00:53:35,700
been painting me into a
corner since we were kids.

812
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,000
I guess I've always been a
better friend to him..

813
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,900
Yeah, I'd love to hear the rest of this
but I've really gotta go back to work.

814
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,000
- Oh, hey. Hey.
- Hey.

815
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,338
I was just thinking that
if you're still alive

816
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:50,600
when I get back from
work tonight, maybe..

817
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,200
I don't know,
we could go to dinner or something?

818
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,499
Yeah, that would be great, yeah.

819
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,500
- Really?
- Yeah.

820
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,099
- Yeah.

821
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,100
OK. Um.. No. Bye.

822
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,000
Hm..

823
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,600
Weird.

824
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,800
What?

825
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,888
I was just thinking about
what it would be like

826
00:54:28,901 --> 00:54:30,900
if we'd met under
different circumstances.

827
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,938
See, I think people
should only fall in love

828
00:54:32,951 --> 00:54:34,900
if there's a great story
behind how they met.

829
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,600
You know, seeing as you have to tell it
over and over again.

830
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,099
If you and I fell in love,
we'd have one hell of a story to tell.

831
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:46,200
We'd be at a dinner party and someone
would ask, "How'd you two meet?"

832
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:51,400
And I'd say, "You tell the story, dear."
And you'd say, "No, you tell it better."

833
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,000
So, come here often?

834
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,700
No. But I heard about someone who does.

835
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,800
- You mean.. The Fairy?
- Yeah.

836
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,900
- Is he..?
- Yeah.

837
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,400
Where?

838
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,400
This is absurd. What are you thinking?

839
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,600
- I'm thinking of a new option.
- What?

840
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,500
- Talking with him.
- Talking with him?

841
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,300
Talking.

842
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,338
You're gonna go over
and say, "I'm Slevin,

843
00:55:25,351 --> 00:55:27,300
some bad dudes think I
am someone I am not."

844
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,200
And I'm gonna have to take you out
or they're gonna take me out

845
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,400
"and I was wondering,
you wanna talk about it?"

846
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,600
- I can't do that.
- You think?

847
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,200
Look, I can't just walk over there.
He's got bodyguards.

848
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,000
Aside from that, you're
pretty much dead-on.

849
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,938
Bodyguards?

850
00:55:41,951 --> 00:55:43,800
Yeah. Right behind him.
Two of them. Israelis.

851
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,300
Beards. Right behind him.

852
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,200
<i>See 'em?</i>

853
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,900
- You're getting good at this.
- Thanks.

854
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,700
How are you gonna have a talk with him?

855
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,100
When he goes to the bathroom,
I'll follow him in.

856
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,900
What do you think?

857
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,900
<i>Could someone tell me why I'm in the van?</i>

858
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,500
<i>Because I could only get
a reservation for two.</i>

859
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,400
<i>All right, The Fairy's at
a table in the middle.</i>

860
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,900
<i>Bodyguards nearby.</i>

861
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,800
<i>Our boy's not far away
but I can't make out who's with him.</i>

862
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,500
<i>- Did Murph get a beat on him yet?
- Murph says, whoever he is, he's a ghost.</i>

863
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,100
<i>Can't find anyone who's ever even bumped
into him, much less tripped over him.</i>

864
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,000
<i>The Fairy's going to the bathroom.</i>

865
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,900
<i>And our boy's making a move. Shit.</i>

866
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,000
<i>- Marty, the door's locked.
- Relax.</i>

867
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,700
It's not gonna go down in the men's room.

868
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,600
I got it next.

869
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,400
- What went down in the men's room?
- We talked.

870
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,200
And?

871
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,300
I told him I thought we
should get together.

872
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,799
- You didn't?
- I did.

873
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,700
And?

874
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,600
- I got a date.
- Do you think this is safe?

875
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,600
It can't be any worse than what's
waiting for me behind door number two.

876
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,900
It's gonna be tough. I think
I picked up a pigtail.

877
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,100
- A what?
- The cops.

878
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,400
Oh, a pig tail. Cute.

879
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,500
I ran into a nosy cop in the men's room.

880
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,400
You and me need to talk.

881
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,400
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

882
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,700
Listen, I'm sorry, no
of fence, but I'm not..

883
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,400
I'm not gay.

884
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,488
I'm a cop.

885
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:11,500
Well, I'm not a robber
if you catch my drift?

886
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,200
I've been watching you.

887
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,900
I know what you're into. Who are you?
I mean, I know who you're not.

888
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,600
You're not Nick Fisher.
The guy whose apartment you're in.

889
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,399
I know because Nick
spent eight years in Dade Correctional

890
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,300
for forcing himself on a
14-year-old cheerleader.

891
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,300
Dade County sent me a
picture of Nick Fisher.

892
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,300
And you.. are not him.

893
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,600
So.. who the fuck are you?

894
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,000
I'm just a guy whose
dinner's getting cold.

895
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,000
May I leave now?

896
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,800
- Come here.
- What?

897
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,338
Dead bodies in refrigerators.
Cops in men's rooms.

898
00:58:48,351 --> 00:58:50,800
You remind me of.. James Bond.

899
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,500
That is the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

900
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,400
And The Boss, he could be Kananga.

901
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,300
Kananga?

902
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,100
- No, The Boss is no Kananga.
- Well, who's The Boss?

903
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,200
Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

904
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,500
Which one? Donald Pleasance?
Telly Savalas? Max von Sydow?

905
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,800
You know your Bond. But alas, I
was referring to Anthony Dawson.

906
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,400
Who?

907
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,100
Well, he played Blofeld
in From Russia With Love.

908
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,500
Well, you never see Blofeld's face
in From Russia With Love.

909
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,688
And that's when the villain
is most effective,

910
00:59:24,701 --> 00:59:26,800
when you don't know
what he looks like.

911
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,700
So..

912
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,300
See you later.

913
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,000
- Ah, that was incredible!
- You..

914
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,200
- I just realized something.
- What's that?

915
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,299
- I just made love to you.
- You're just realizing that now?

916
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,488
And I have no idea
who specifically you

917
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,700
were referring to when
you said James Bond.

918
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,900
Because earlier when you were telling me
that I reminded you of James Bond,

919
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
and I was saying that it was the nicest
thing anybody's ever said to me,

920
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,100
I naturally assumed..

921
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,300
You naturally assumed
you knew who I was talking about.

922
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,738
Because if you don't -
if you weren't talking

923
01:00:52,751 --> 01:00:55,000
about the guy I think that
you're talking about,

924
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,488
well, you have me mistaken
for somebody else,

925
01:00:57,501 --> 01:00:59,900
because in my mind there
is only one Bond.

926
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,000
Well, on that we agree.

927
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,500
Same time on three.

928
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,299
- One..
- Two..

929
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,100
- Three. George Lazenby.
- Roger Moore.

930
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,499
- George Lazenby?
- Roger Moore? I was kidding.

931
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,000
- Yeah, I was kidding.
- You were?

932
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,099
The only James Bond is..

933
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,200
- Timothy Dalton.
- Pierce Brosnan.

934
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,500
- Scotland forever.
- I feel so much better.

935
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,300
Why are you going?

936
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,900
I'm just going to get us some coffee.

937
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,700
OK.

938
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,900
Hurry back to me.

939
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,099
After Laughter

940
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:17,100
When you're in love, you're happy

941
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,700
Oh, and when you're in her arms

942
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:26,800
You gain

943
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,100
After..

944
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,100
Hey! Police.

945
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,200
Aw, come on, man.

946
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,700
I already talked to your buddy.

947
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,300
After..
After your laughter

948
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,400
Good morning. I'm Detective Dumbrowski.

949
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,600
Good morning, Detective.
Am I being kidnapped?

950
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,700
Nope. We just want to have
a quick, friendly word with you.

951
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,300
Is this standard operating procedure
you'd find in the policeman's manual

952
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,900
if you look up "quick, friendly word"?

953
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,600
There is no SOP for the box
you got yourself into.

954
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh.

955
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,100
- So what do you want to talk to me about?
- You.

956
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,300
- What about me?
- Who are you?

957
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,900
- Philosophically speaking?
- Name.

958
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,400
- Rank, serial number..
- You should really play ball.

959
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,500
You think I'm tall enough?

960
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,100
- What is your name?
- Oh, yeah, I remember. Slevin Kelevra.

961
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,400
K-E-L-E-V-R-A.

962
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,200
<i>- Kelevra.
- Look, kid,</i>

963
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,300
I don't know what's going on,
or how you're into this,

964
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,800
but when I figure out what
there is to figure out,

965
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,800
I'm not gonna be so nice to you.

966
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,800
Oh, this is nice. Don't do me any favors.

967
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,000
<i>Last chance to come clean.</i>

968
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,600
Take a walk.

969
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,500
I think this is the part
where you tell me not to walk too far.

970
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,199
When you're in love

971
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,100
You're happy

972
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,600
Oh, and when you're in her arms

973
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:06,500
You gain

974
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,500
After
This doesn't matter..

975
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,000
I have to go to work.

976
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Hey.

977
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,500
After
After..

978
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,800
- Hey, guys, what are you doing here?
- Now's the time.

979
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,100
I've got at least.. Jesus.

980
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,400
The Boss says he wants you to look nice
for The Fairy.

981
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,500
You're early.

982
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,288
Why don't you come in and
fix yourself a drink?

983
01:07:15,301 --> 01:07:17,200
I was just getting ready.

984
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,300
<i>You'll have to excuse the..</i>

985
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,100
I wasn't expecting you for..

986
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,800
<i>You look good.</i>

987
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,900
<i>- You want some wine?
- No.</i>

988
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Is something the matter?

989
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,200
Somebody's trying to kill you.

990
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,900
Who?

991
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,800
Me.

992
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,800
- That was close.
- Yeah.

993
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,400
Close.

994
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,500
<i>I hired you to do a job.</i>

995
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
It wasn't supposed to look like a job.

996
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So you take out the Israelis,
bomb the damn building..

997
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:43,000
and now the job
that was not supposed to look like a job's

998
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,300
beginning to look very much

999
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,400
like a job.

1000
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,900
All right. Fuck it.

1001
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,400
If the Rabbi wants a war..

1002
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,800
I'll give him a war.

1003
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,500
Saul.

1004
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,500
- Saul.

1005
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,199
<i>Saul, the phone's been..</i>

1006
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,200
Oh.

1007
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,200
I thought you were Saul.

1008
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,100
People have been thinking
I'm somebody else.

1009
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,999
Your predicament reminds me of a story.

1010
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,400
Hitchcock. North By Northwest.

1011
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,000
The movie where everybody thinks Cary
Grant is a man named George Kaplan,

1012
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,588
but the thing is there
is no George Kaplan.

1013
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:47,100
It's just a made-up name.

1014
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,500
But names, even made-up ones..

1015
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,200
can bring about quite a bit of trouble.

1016
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,500
Now..

1017
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,799
the woman in the picture with Grant,

1018
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,200
<i>- her name was er..
- Eva Marie Saint.</i>

1019
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:05,000
- Oh.. you know this movie.
- I know this movie.

1020
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,200
I took my father to see it in 1959.
His English wasn't very good,

1021
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,100
but boy, did he like Miss Saint.

1022
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,000
After the movie he turned to me and
he said, "She's a real Buick."

1023
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,500
You see, he couldn't pronounce
the word beauty, so he'd say Buick.

1024
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,500
- Caused quite a bit of confusion.
- Using the wrong name'll do that.

1025
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,599
Is that my money?

1026
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,000
This is everything I owe you.

1027
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:07,000
It's the Sabbath. You see,
we don't answer the phone on the Sabbath.

1028
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,900
I know.

1029
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,800
Normally Saul turns off the ringer.

1030
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,000
Saul!

1031
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,700
I tell you, you can't find
good help these days.

1032
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,700
Saul's dead.

1033
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,600
<i>They're all dead.</i>

1034
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,100
Oh, I've been in this room before.

1035
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,500
Looks the same as it did 20 years ago.

1036
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,700
Somehow..

1037
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,900
Somehow it seems different.

1038
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,600
The way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it.

1039
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,900
Then again, it's been 20 years
since I've been in a car.

1040
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,199
Two decades spent behind three inches
of bulletproof glass

1041
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,800
due to a natural fear of high-powered
rifles and quiet.. rooftops in New Jersey.

1042
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,900
20 years..

1043
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,100
locked away in my own paranoia,
a prisoner in my own home.

1044
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,200
Only to be delivered to fate by a boy.

1045
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,000
<i>Well, Anthony, it looks as though you've
won, if such a term may be applied.</i>

1046
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,600
<i>If I were wearing a hat,
I would take it off.</i>

1047
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,100
Should we get on with it, then?

1048
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,300
You can keep your hat on, Schlomo.

1049
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:03,500
Looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman.

1050
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Nice speech, though.

1051
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,900
I wish I was standing for it.

1052
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,700
You.. you brought this upon our heads.

1053
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,900
- Me?
- You.. you hired Good Kat to kill my son.

1054
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,800
After you murdered my son?

1055
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:41,299
- I had no hand in that.
- Oh, sure.

1056
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,300
Just like in '84?

1057
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,300
I suppose you had no hand in that either.
Just a finger, maybe?

1058
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,900
Time's up, Rabbi.

1059
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,300
Lying to a dead man's
the same as lying to yourself.

1060
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,100
You were getting too big.

1061
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,800
See..

1062
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,100
problem when two men
are standing in a room

1063
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,000
is you can only look at one of them
and they were looking at you

1064
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:15,400
with their backs turned,
their shirt collars smiling at me.

1065
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,300
Then they called you The Boss.

1066
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,300
It was clear what had to be done.

1067
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,200
Try and appreciate how
it feels, Schlomo..

1068
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,400
to wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach.

1069
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,500
Lying in a pool of your
own blood and shit.

1070
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,600
The dead eyes of..

1071
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,500
of your wife.. staring back at you.

1072
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,099
The only thing keeping
you from passing out

1073
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,100
is the sound of the footsteps of the man
going down the hall..

1074
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,400
looking for your son.

1075
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,400
I managed to save my son, Schlomo.

1076
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And now..

1077
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,100
after all these years..

1078
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,500
in spite of our agreement!

1079
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,299
You.. you..

1080
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:29,200
fucking backstabbing Philistine.

1081
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,200
You managed to take my son away from me.

1082
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,600
Well..

1083
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,899
now I've taken your son away from you.

1084
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,800
I told you I had nothing to do with..

1085
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,500
You haven't heard.

1086
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,500
Will I?

1087
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:58,600
Look at my face, Schlomo.
Look at my smile.

1088
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,100
Your son is dead.

1089
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,400
Your son is dead.

1090
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,500
I'm gonna kill you. Hm.

1091
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,800
<i>Rabbi.</i>

1092
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,100
<i>Are you familiar with the Shmoo?</i>

1093
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,900
Fisher.

1094
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,600
Fisher, listen to me.

1095
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,800
I already told you,

1096
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,900
I'm not Nick Fisher.

1097
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Then who is Nick Fisher?

1098
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,100
I think you mean, who was Nick Fisher?

1099
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,500
Fisher was the answer to a question.

1100
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,200
How do you get to two men
that can't be gotten to?

1101
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,800
<i>You get them to come to you.</i>

1102
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,900
<i>But to do that.. I needed a name.</i>

1103
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,800
<i>And where do you find names?</i>

1104
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,900
<i>In books.</i>

1105
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,600
<i>And who has books?</i>

1106
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,300
<i>Well, your bookies have books.</i>

1107
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,200
He's clean.

1108
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,200
<i>Crooked bookies..</i>

1109
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
<i>- .. who work with big-time crooks.
- So.. why are you here?</i>

1110
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,900
<i>I was looking for a gambler.</i>

1111
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,100
<i>One who was in both books..</i>

1112
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,100
<i>with a lot of red in the minus column.</i>

1113
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,300
Got him.

1114
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,400
<i>And that's when I found Nick Fisher.</i>

1115
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
<i>A lowlife that no-one was gonna miss.</i>

1116
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,999
1729.

1117
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,200
Nick Fisher.

1118
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,200
OK.

1119
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,400
<i>There was a time.</i>

1120
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,000
All that was left to do
was make the phone ring.

1121
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:21,300
<i>All I had to do was pull the trigger
and wait for you to call the man</i>

1122
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,600
<i>who does the jobs that no-one else wants.</i>

1123
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,600
<i>I want an outsider brought in.</i>

1124
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,200
There's a specialist.

1125
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,300
Calls himself Mr. Good Kat.

1126
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,000
Fine.

1127
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,800
Tell him he can expect me in the morning.

1128
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,300
Are you ready?

1129
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,300
Yeah.

1130
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:00,200
It's just that one last thing.

1131
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,200
<i>Mr. Good Kat.</i>

1132
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,800
It's been a long time.

1133
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,188
I'm sorry to have kept you
waiting, Mr. Good Kat.

1134
01:23:19,201 --> 01:23:21,400
So I'll get right
down to business.

1135
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:26,200
Slim Hopkins, the man who ran my book,
was hit yesterday.

1136
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,000
And I guess you've already heard about..

1137
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,000
<i>- .. my son.
- Yes, I heard.</i>

1138
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,700
I need you to sort it out for me.

1139
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,400
Who's the mark?

1140
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,000
Yitzchok.

1141
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,800
Yitzchok, The Rabbi's son?

1142
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,000
<i>You remember The Rabbi?</i>

1143
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,900
I remember The Rabbi well.

1144
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,500
<i>Thing is..</i>

1145
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,000
it can't look like a job.

1146
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:56,300
<i>If Yitzchok gets hit, The
Rabbi will go to war.</i>

1147
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,100
So.. I need you to make it look like
it ain't what it is.

1148
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,699
<i>Can that be done?</i>

1149
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,700
Anything can be done.

1150
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,100
Good. How?

1151
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,300
Kansas City Shuffle.

1152
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,900
I'm not familiar with the term.

1153
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,600
I'll need to see Slim's books.

1154
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:29,100
Slim's books were taken when he was hit,
but.. I do keep copies.

1155
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,700
What are you looking for?

1156
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,600
This is our guy. Nick - 1729.

1157
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,300
1729.

1158
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,700
Nick Fisher.

1159
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,900
Why him?

1160
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,600
A loser.

1161
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,900
Pick him up. Bring him here.

1162
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,300
<i>Still not talking to each other, huh?</i>

1163
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,400
<i>Can't say that I blame you.</i>

1164
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,500
- Why are you here?
- Big job.

1165
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,600
I was under the impression
you no longer worked New York.

1166
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:12,700
Like I said.. very big job.

1167
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,788
And you thought, as
long as you're in town,

1168
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:16,800
you'd drop by and see
your old pal Schlomo,

1169
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,600
and say, "Hello. How about them Yanks?"

1170
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,800
No. But something like that.

1171
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,699
Only problem is you and
I aren't old friends.

1172
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,200
And I hate baseball.

1173
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,400
And since we're not friends and you hate
baseball, why the fuck are you here?

1174
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,300
It's because we're not
friends that I'm here.

1175
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:42,700
Because if we had been friends, I wouldn't
have been hired to kill your son.

1176
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,088
Because that is right at
the top of my list of

1177
01:25:45,101 --> 01:25:47,400
things that friends do
not do to their friends.

1178
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,600
The good news for you is,
my friendship is for sale.

1179
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,600
You see, it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive

1180
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,600
than he does to The Boss dead.

1181
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,800
And more money means more to me
than less money.

1182
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:02,900
And you are the guy that sleeps with
all that green under your mattress.

1183
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,200
I'm listening.

1184
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,238
You will pay me double
to kill The Boss what

1185
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:09,200
The Boss was paying
me to kill Yitzchok.

1186
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,300
- Ohh.
- And that..

1187
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:16,000
And that will make us friends.

1188
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,700
Right, Rabbi?

1189
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,100
Hm?

1190
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:29,600
And.. since friends do favors for their
friends, you will do a favor for me.

1191
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:32,500
Pray tell? What is this favor?

1192
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:36,000
Concerns a matter of debt collection.
One debt in particular.

1193
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,200
Whose?

1194
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:40,200
A flop. From Benny's book.
Goes by the name of Nick Fisher.

1195
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,400
Who is he?

1196
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,499
Just a loser.

1197
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,500
You just made a lot of money.

1198
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,900
<i>And then I was free
to come and go as I pleased.</i>

1199
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:07,099
Hm?

1200
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:10,100
Whatever they're paying you..

1201
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,000
Oh.

1202
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,100
There is nobody.

1203
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,300
I did this to you.

1204
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,300
- Me.
- You.

1205
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:30,800
Me.

1206
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,600
Who are you?

1207
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,100
<i>Who is he?</i>

1208
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:47,300
Considering he no longer has fingerprints,
I'd say it's unlikely we'll ever know.

1209
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,200
What about dental records?

1210
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:51,938
Sure, find the bottom
half of the jaw, then all

1211
01:27:51,951 --> 01:27:54,600
we need to do is find out
who the dentist was.

1212
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,400
What a fucking mess.

1213
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:01,000
<i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Marty, you there?</i>

1214
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:05,000
<i>We found two more bodies to go along
with the two you've already got.</i>

1215
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,000
All right, I'll be right over.

1216
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,138
Did you ever get a hold of
The Rabbi so he can get

1217
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:11,200
down here and identify
what's left of his kid?

1218
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:14,599
<i>Negative. We've been calling
for the last hour, no answer.</i>

1219
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,100
Send somebody over.

1220
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,300
<i>Copy.</i>

1221
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,999
You all right? You look a little shook-up.

1222
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,800
No, I'm fine.

1223
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,900
All right.

1224
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,400
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, Brikowski, it's Murphy.</i>

1225
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,000
Hey, Murph, what's up?

1226
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:56,100
<i>Harry Kello came by today.
You remember Harry?</i>

1227
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,038
He retired a few years ago.
His wife just died,

1228
01:28:58,051 --> 01:28:59,900
so he comes in a couple
of times a week,

1229
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,999
talks shop, tells stories to the rooks.

1230
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,788
Starts every sentence
with, "The way things

1231
01:29:03,801 --> 01:29:05,600
used to be". Guy
living in the past.

1232
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,199
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, what about him?
- We're making small talk.</i>

1233
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,700
Guy says he can't complain,
then all he does is fuckin' complain.

1234
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,100
His dead wife, the leg he got shot in,
his crappy pension,

1235
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:18,700
but then he stops when he sees the picture
Marty snapped of your kid.

1236
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:22,500
Just stares at it.
I say, "What is it? You know the kid?"

1237
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,200
Thing is, he ain't looking at the picture,
but at the name.

1238
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:28,600
I've got it written at the bottom.
He knows that name: Slevin.

1239
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,800
I have that same phone.

1240
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,788
<i>About an hour later
the phone rings, it's</i>

1241
01:30:03,801 --> 01:30:05,900
<i>Harry, talking like a
goddamned machine gun,</i>

1242
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,400
going on and on about a
horse race back in '79.

1243
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,100
<i>Aqueduct.</i>

1244
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,300
Seven horse, tenth race - ring a bell?

1245
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:25,700
<i>It was a drug store handicap.</i>

1246
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:29,600
<i>Big wind-up, around the time The Boss,
The Rabbi set up shop in New York,</i>

1247
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,600
<i>before people started
waking up with knives in their backs.</i>

1248
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:37,200
Anyway, he goes on about this
local legend, about this kid.

1249
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:39,000
His name was Max.

1250
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,400
<i>Max placed a bet with a bookie named Roth.</i>

1251
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,700
Roth laid the bet off.

1252
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,300
On you.

1253
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,100
And you.

1254
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:09,400
But when The Rabbi and The Boss
find out the fix is in,

1255
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,400
they are the opposite of happy.

1256
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,400
Word comes down an example is to be made.

1257
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,300
Aargh!

1258
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,600
These guys kill everyone!

1259
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:18,900
<i>And I mean every one.</i>

1260
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:23,100
<i>Max, his wife, his kid, Roth..</i>

1261
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,000
<i>even the goddamned horse died.</i>

1262
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:28,500
These guys went to town with a tomahawk.
It was a fucking massacre.

1263
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:34,200
<i>They had to bring in a specialist to do
the kid cos nobody would take the job.</i>

1264
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,600
What have you done with my son?

1265
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,900
You?

1266
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
No.

1267
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:15,300
You're dead.

1268
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,100
You're dead!

1269
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:29,100
<i>So Harry's going on about how they had to
bring in a specialist to kill the kid,</i>

1270
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:33,200
but I ain't seeing the connection, so I
says, "What has this to do with the case?"

1271
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,299
<i>He says, "The horse's name."</i>

1272
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,400
<i>I say, "What about the horse's name?"</i>

1273
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:41,700
<i>He says the horse's name was
Lucky Number Slevin.</i>

1274
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,700
- What is your name?
- Slevin Kelevra.

1275
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,500
Do you remember this part?

1276
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,700
Please! I have a family.

1277
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,600
Not any more, you don't.

1278
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,400
Henry!

1279
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,400
You fucking bastards!

1280
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,500
You fucking bastards!

1281
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:40,600
The two of you killed
everything I ever loved.

1282
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,500
Fuck you both.

1283
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,800
<i>Now, there is no such person as
Slevin Kelevra, as far as I can tell.</i>

1284
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,000
<i>Which means the kid was using a pseudonym.</i>

1285
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:22,000
<i>Which is interesting,
him picking the name of a dead racehorse</i>

1286
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:24,300
and keeping company
with The Boss and The Rabbi,

1287
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,500
seeing as they had some involvement
with that very horse.

1288
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,200
<i>I thought to myself, maybe
it means something.</i>

1289
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:34,900
<i>Then again, maybe it's just a coincidence,
name's gotta come from someplace - right?</i>

1290
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,600
<i>I guess none of this really matters
now that the kid's gone cold.</i>

1291
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,400
<i>Ah, one more thing,
we've got a new guy in the precinct.</i>

1292
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,600
<i>Jewish fella, funny
little guy, talks a lot.</i>

1293
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,800
<i>Anyway, in case you're interested,
he says the name Kelevra is Hebrew.</i>

1294
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,000
<i>He says it means..</i>

1295
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,000
Bad dog.

1296
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,899
<i>20 years ago, he used to be my bookie.</i>

1297
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:11,000
<i>I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.</i>

1298
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,500
Brikowski? You there?

1299
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:20,000
<i>Your girl made me.</i>

1300
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,700
She took my picture.

1301
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,600
She's got to go in the ground.

1302
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,800
OK.

1303
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,400
I have something I have to tell you.

1304
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
He told me that we needed to kill you.

1305
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:04,100
You're gonna have to trust me.

1306
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:17,000
Shit!

1307
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,800
He's going to shoot you here.

1308
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,900
I didn't think you'd understand.

1309
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,400
I understood.

1310
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
How did you find out about us?

1311
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,200
I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead.

1312
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:48,300
How do you think I found out?

1313
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,600
I thought you might want this.

1314
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,600
I want to go home.

1315
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,900
Neither of us is going
home for a long time, kid.

1316
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,600
My name is Good Kat.

1317
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,600
You can call me Mr. Good Kat.

1318
