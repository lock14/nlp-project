1
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:05,814
Attention all fellow deer!

2
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,624
If you find deer feed
in the middle of the forest,

3
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,323
be a bit suspicious.

4
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:12,004
'Morning, sir.
How are you doing?

5
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,203
Good.

6
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:15,603
I'm looking for a 20-gauge,

7
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:19,284
maybe a Coach or a Western
Competition Special.

8
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:21,883
Yeah, I think I have
just what you need.

9
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:28,123
- Try this one on for size.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:29,723
- Hey, Cliff.
- Yeah?

11
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:32,244
The 12-gauge and 20-gauge shotgun
shells should be here by Thursday.

12
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:35,123
Make it Tuesday
with the 454 Casull.

13
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:41,164
Good job.

Just a couple questions here.

45
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:47,085
All right, it was a 12-gauge?

46
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:48,766
A 20-gauge.

47
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,646
So it was a Coach gun?
You were behind the counter?

48
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:53,605
Sir, here's your contract.

49
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:57,045
I hate these shotgun cases...
a real pain in the ass.

50
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:59,040
And he had a shell in his pocket
when he came in here.

51
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,765
Inside his jacket.

52
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:03,126
- He brought his own ammo?
- Then he was up there.

53
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:06,085
The guy scattered all over this place,
and every blob of him a biohazard.

54
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:09,606
Hey, Carl, he's over here
in Fishing too.

55
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:12,486
Yeah, a real pain in the ass.

56
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:13,885
All right, thanks.

57
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,326
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

58
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:18,886
All right, we're wrapping it up.

59
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:22,726
Three grand just to wipe the asshole
up off the floor.

60
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:26,046
Hey, you can handle this report
tonight, can't you?

61
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,006
I got a thing I gotta do.

62
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:31,205
Is it a blonde thing
or a brunette thing?

63
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,446
You are strong.

64
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,440
You are powerful.

65
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:44,366
You can do anything.

66
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:48,006
You are a winner.

67
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,726
- Ooh. Hey.
- Aunt Norah's here.

68
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,006
Finally. Thank you.
I'm gonna be so late for class.

69
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:57,966
And she brought Crunchy Corn.

70
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,246
Crunchy Corn, Crunchy Corn,
Crunchy Crunchy Crunchy Corn.

71
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:02,846
- Hey.
- Sorry.

72
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,446
Mm!

73
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:08,806
Guys, don't eat too much of that.

74
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,646
He's gonna be hyper all night,
you realize that?

75
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:12,967
Yes. Yes, I do.

76
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:14,887
All right. How do I look?

77
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:17,486
- Good.
- Yeah?

78
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:19,647
I'm kidding.

79
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:21,286
I love you.

80
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,247
And don't tell him any more
Lobster Man stories.

81
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:25,007
He had nightmares all week.

82
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:28,167
Okay, just use some
common sense, okay?

83
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:30,846
Okay. "Thank you so much".
You're welcome.

84
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:34,207
He hears this horrible sound.

85
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,967
This is how it goes.

86
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,927
Snap.

87
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:40,247
Snap, drag.

88
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:42,407
Snap. Snap, drag.

89
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,367
And the thing is that he knows

90
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:46,967
that Lobster Man
is out there somewhere,

91
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:49,287
and he's totally screwed

92
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,407
'cause his tongue
is stuck to the mailbox.

93
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:53,647
Well, then why did he lick
the mailbox?

94
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:56,447
Because he has OCD

95
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,887
and is obsessed with
licking mailboxes.

96
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:01,287
Well, then why wasn't he
in school?

97
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:03,927
Are you gonna let me tell the story
or are you gonna drive me crazy?

98
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:07,846
Well, maybe he didn't go to school
because he had the ACD.

99
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:14,846
Sorry.

100
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:19,727
You should hear the way he goes on

101
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:22,648
about his lean body mass

102
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,767
weight index bullshit. God.

103
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:28,767
When was the last time
you even played basketball, Mac?

104
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:30,728
He needed to be brought down
a peg or two.

105
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,207
I'm sure you pulling your groin muscle
really impressed him.

106
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,407
I should introduce him
to your sister.

107
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:40,848
Oh, yeah, Norah and a cop...
that's a good idea.

108
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:46,328
Hey, you know, I was working
a scene today

109
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:49,648
where this guy offed himself
in a sporting goods store.

110
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,368
So they brought this
cleaning crew in, right?

111
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:55,408
You would not believe
how much they charge for that shit.

112
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:58,128
With the body there?

113
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,048
No, the body's gone.
It's just blood and stuff.

114
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:02,488
That's gross.

115
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,328
Yeah, well, if you ask me,
it's a racket.

116
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,448
You ought to get into that.

117
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,328
Do you think that's all I can do,
is clean up other people's shit?

118
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,808
Come here.

119
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:16,167
Come here.

120
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:34,068
You know that's not what I think.

121
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,929
- Will there be anything else?
- Yes, please.

122
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,728
- Yes, sir.
- A cup of coffee and your name.

123
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,288
Oh, forgive me.
I forgot my nametag.

124
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:45,889
Yeah, I noticed.

125
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,609
- It's Emma Jean.
- Emma Jean, I'm Stan.

126
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,048
Nice to meet you, Stan.

127
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:54,198
Hey.

128
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:57,208
I thought your class got over at 9:30.

129
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,889
Why isn't he in bed?

130
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,689
He said he was scared.
I think he was faking it, though.

131
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,168
Here.

132
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:07,809
No, don't.

133
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,808
- Take it. It's 10 dollars.
- No.

134
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:12,329
I know you need it.
Dad told me about you getting fired.

135
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,068
Great.

136
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:18,208
What happened?

137
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,728
You know what, Norah?

138
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,689
When you're gonna grow up
and start taking responsibility

139
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,409
and start taking some pride...

140
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,169
Rose, you love it
when I fuck up, okay?

141
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,489
Me screwing up
gives you the hugest woody.

142
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,768
Shh.

143
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,769
Take the money.

144
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,129
Please.

145
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,209
There was a diner scene earlier,

146
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,689
with a waitress.

147
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,209
Any pie?

148
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,169
Completely pie-free.

149
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,449
Hi.

150
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,570
Excuse me, we're all finished.

151
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:12,410
Because it's our first visit,
we did the blinds and the appliances,

152
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:15,649
but we're gonna alternate those
weekly in the future.

153
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,889
- And nobody mentioned...
- Rose?

154
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,849
Rose Lorkowski.

155
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,090
Yeah.

156
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:26,449
Paula Datzman,
cheerleading squad, junior year.

157
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,530
Paula Datzman, hi.

158
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:32,850
Wow. How are you?

159
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:37,009
Great.
Well, I'm Paula Datzman-Mead now.

160
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,530
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thanks.

161
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:43,169
We're expecting our second
in a couple of months.

162
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,490
God, you know, I was always
so envious of you...

163
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:50,504
head cheerleader,
dating the quarterback.

164
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:54,650
Did you and Mac
end up getting married?

165
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:58,810
No. No, you know,

166
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:02,929
I heard that he married
Heather Volkmann.

167
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:06,050
It's so great seeing you.

168
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:08,570
- Here, let me get your information.
- Okay.

169
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:11,210
And I'll send you an invite
to the baby shower.

170
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,850
Fantastic. Great.

171
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:16,491
It'll be like a big reunion.

172
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,490
The whole gang from high school
is gonna be there.

173
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:21,011
Yeah?

174
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:23,050
So what are you doing now?

175
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:26,010
I just got my real estate license.

176
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:28,850
Real estate?

177
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:30,810
Yeah, this is just a temporary thing

178
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:33,211
until I phase over into real estate
full time.

179
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:35,890
You're kidding. I'm in real estate
with Long & Foster.

180
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:37,331
Really?

181
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,251
Who are you with?

182
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:43,410
Me? I haven't decided yet.

183
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:47,570
Maybe I'll check out Long & Foster.
They look nice.

184
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:04,611
Come on.

185
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:15,930
Shit.

186
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:20,291
Hello.

187
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:22,331
- Hello, Miss Lorkowski?
- Yeah.

188
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,891
This is Mrs. Pierce
from Sandy Elementary School.

189
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,252
- Oscar's in trouble again.
- Okay.

190
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,491
His teacher and the principal
are in conference,

191
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:33,051
and they really want to meet
with you immediately.

192
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:53,331
It's not just this incident.

193
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:57,652
There have been
several episodes during the last year

194
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:59,972
where Oscar has engaged

195
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:02,492
in disruptive behavior.

196
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:04,932
There was the incident
in the gym class.

197
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,972
I paid the damages for that.

198
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,332
And the time when he locked
Jeremy Johnston in the...

199
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,932
Okay okay.

200
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,732
What did he do this time?

201
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,852
Now it's licking.

202
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:19,651
First it was the pencil sharpener

203
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:21,612
and then the aquarium.

204
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:24,812
It's unsanitary and it's disturbing
to the other children.

205
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:29,172
We feel that Oscar might benefit
from an environment

206
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:32,166
where he could receive
more specialized attention.

207
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:35,252
What does that mean,

208
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:38,012
"specialized attention"?

209
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:40,931
He licked my leg.

210
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:45,172
In situations like this

211
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:48,252
- we generally recommend medication.
- I'm not doing that.

212
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:52,612
Actually, it's not so much
a recommendation as it is a requirement.

213
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:55,892
There are many drugs
that are very effective

214
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,611
with very few side effects.

215
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:02,892
We all feel that this is the best
solution for everybody involved.

216
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:04,852
Sure. Come on, let's go.

217
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:06,807
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- It's okay.

218
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:08,293
It's not you. It's them.

219
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:11,012
I'll tell you one thing for sure...
we are not coming back here.

220
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:13,412
Okay? Okay.

221
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:17,132
We just have to figure something out.

222
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:21,052
I'll just figure something out.

223
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:29,052
- Hi. Is your daddy home?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:31,773
- Can I talk to him?
- Sure.

225
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:33,493
Hello.

226
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:35,733
Hi, Mac. It's me.

227
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:38,453
What are you calling here for?

228
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:41,532
I know. I'm sorry,
but I really needed to talk to you.

229
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,853
Look, Heather could have
easily picked up.

230
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:46,293
They want to put Oscar
on medication

231
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:49,013
and I need to get him out of this school
and get him into a private school

232
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:50,773
or something, I don't know.

233
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:52,733
Why don't we talk
about this later?

234
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:55,253
Because it can't wait, Mac.

235
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:58,453
I need to make some money. I need
to make some good money, like, now.

236
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:01,053
What about that crime-scene thing
I told you about?

237
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:03,213
I know, but do they make
good money?

238
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,013
Yeah, it seems like they do
pretty well.

239
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:07,213
And it's just like cleaning up a house

240
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:08,853
but there's blood there?

241
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:10,773
Yeah, basically... body fluids.

242
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:13,454
Okay.

243
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:15,733
So do you think that you could
hook me up with that

244
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:17,974
with your connections or...?

245
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:19,214
Please?

246
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:21,453
Okay. Right, yeah.
Let's talk later.

247
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:23,413
I gotta go. Bye.

248
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:40,173
So what do you think?

249
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,814
- Norah.
- What?

250
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:47,493
Norah, are you even
listening to me?

251
00:14:47,494 --> 00:14:48,974
No, thank you.

252
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,813
What else do you have to do?
You don't go to school.

253
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:53,094
You don't have a job and you live
with Dad. And no offense, Dad,

254
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:55,414
but do you really want to live
with Dad for the rest of your life?

255
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:58,454
You really think you can make a ton
of cash cleaning up after dead people?

256
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,534
I know I can.
It's very lucrative.

257
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:03,494
- Let's have a nice pleasant dinner.
- It's a racket.

258
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:06,054
Rose, you buy generic cigarettes
with couch change.

259
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,894
How are you gonna afford
private school?

260
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:10,134
It's only until I get
my real estate license.

261
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,734
And I quit smoking, by the way.

262
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:14,134
- Who's going to private school?
- Nobody, Dad.

263
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:16,694
- Did Oscar get kicked out again?
- Yeah.

264
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:18,174
- No.
- Oh, for God's sake, what is wrong

265
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:20,334
with those people?
He's an imaginative kid.

266
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:21,974
Don't they have any sense at all?

267
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:23,934
I want to have my birthday at Hinkle's.

268
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:27,414
No Hinkle's this year.
This year I'm taking you to Disneyland.

269
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:28,495
- Dad.
- Really?

270
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:29,814
- I'm taking him to Disneyland.
- Dad, don't.

271
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:32,254
I'm taking him to Disneyland.

272
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:35,174
Who wants to split a combination plate?

273
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,174
- Hi there.
- Hi.

274
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:42,895
- Norah.
- Hi, Grandpa.

275
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:44,935
Norah.

276
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:47,174
Come on, I'm here.

277
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:49,175
- Are you sure you're okay with this?
- Yeah, absolutely.

278
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:50,935
But this boy's got to
get back to school.

279
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,534
What are you doing
about school?

280
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,134
I'm working on it.
Thank you.

281
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:58,615
What did Mac tell you
about this, Rose?

282
00:15:58,616 --> 00:16:00,415
It's a crime scene.

283
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,495
- With blood?
- Maybe.

284
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:05,095
I hate Mac.

285
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:14,734
Hi.

286
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:19,175
Some sort of domestic disturbance
kind of deal.

287
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,775
It was the lady got the last word,
I guess,

288
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:24,894
but of course she's in jail now.

289
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:29,534
I heard one bullet completely
shot off his ring finger.

290
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:32,455
How long have you guys been doing
this kind of work?

291
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:34,735
A while.

292
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,414
The last one on the left there.

293
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,575
It's fine.

294
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:22,375
I found it.

295
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,135
Do you think they loved each other?

296
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:36,016
Yeah.

297
00:17:44,337 --> 00:17:46,016
Car. Things.

298
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:47,776
Yeah.

299
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:56,495
Ew.

300
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:03,856
Spritz.

301
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:10,296
It's not working.

302
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,336
If you scrub and I wipe,
then it works.

303
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:15,257
- I'm spraying as well.
- Can you spray and scrub?

304
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:19,016
More and more people
are turning to wholesome foods.

305
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:21,616
Are you telling me this fancy corn
stuff is some kind of health food?

306
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:24,336
Well, it's candy and it's a health food.
That's what I'm telling you, yeah.

307
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,256
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Here.

308
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,456
- We don't have much more shelf space.
- Right, okay.

309
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:30,536
Look at the ingredients in here.
What does this say?

310
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:32,497
Look at that... glycerone...

311
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:34,376
glyc... gly...

312
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:37,337
I can't even pronounce it.
It's all chemicals.

313
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:40,376
How can you call it food
if it hasn't got any vowels in it?

314
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:42,497
Take a look at this now.
What has it got in there?

315
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:44,417
- High fructose...
- No no no. Look.

316
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:47,577
The first ingredient there is...

317
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:49,217
- Corn.
- Corn!

318
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:52,417
Corn... can you imagine
anything more healthful than corn?

319
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:55,537
It's made right here
in Albuquerque too.

320
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:58,537
You know, I've been reading
that the chemicals...

321
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,257
Hey, do you know if they sell
fancy corn here?

322
00:19:01,258 --> 00:19:03,136
I don't know.

323
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:06,897
I heard the strawberry fancy corn
gives you bionic strength.

324
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:08,977
It's true.

325
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:11,177
There's some sort of chemical
in strawberry flavor.

326
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:14,497
And that means if you eat a whole
lot of it, you get bionic strength.

327
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,177
I don't believe you.

328
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:18,737
I don't care if you do or not.

329
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:20,657
You're not gonna get rid
of me very easily.

330
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:22,577
Well, I understand that as well.
However,

331
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,737
I don't have any room on the shelf
for your product.

332
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:27,457
- Yeah, well...
- Like I said,

333
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,777
I already put in all the orders
I want for this year.

334
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:34,377
Excuse me, do you carry something
called fancy corn?

335
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:37,258
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

336
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,418
That was really something, Oscar.
That was really terrific.

337
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,377
You got the moves.
You got the nerve.

338
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:44,297
You're a real sharp cookie.

339
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:46,738
- No, I'm not. I'm stupid.
- No, you're not.

340
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:49,137
Why are you saying that?
Why do you say you're stupid?

341
00:19:49,138 --> 00:19:52,178
It's true. The teachers want
to put me in retard class.

342
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:53,777
Who wants to put you
in retard class?

343
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:55,697
The teachers.

344
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:58,338
They don't know how to deal
with somebody as intelligent as you are,

345
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:01,338
that's what the problem is.
You are a very very smart kid.

346
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,978
- Do you get bored a lot?
- Yeah.

347
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:04,737
- Do you look out the window?
- All the time.

348
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:07,932
That proves how intelligent you are.
They should be catering to you.

349
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,698
They should be doing
something special for you.

350
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:11,898
- You really think so?
- I know so.

351
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:15,177
On top of that, I think you're
a goddamn genius.

352
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:18,458
Hi.

353
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,378
You gals did a real nice job.

354
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:22,857
Thank you.

355
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,138
$500.

356
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:28,258
You can call us anytime.

357
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:31,018
Call you anytime.

358
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:34,498
It was so disgusting.

359
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,378
And the smell was just bad.

360
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:38,618
Yeah.

361
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:41,618
I can't even really describe it.

362
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:44,938
But, you know,
we took all that stuff away

363
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,418
- and we made it better.
- Yeah.

364
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:47,858
We made it right.

365
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:50,298
Hey, I'm really sorry.

366
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:51,818
No.

367
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,658
No, I feel like I got you
into this mess.

368
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:56,498
You know what I'm gonna do?

369
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:58,498
I'm gonna pay for your
real estate classes.

370
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:00,018
Okay?

371
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:01,378
You can get your license,

372
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:05,058
get your little picture
in the Real Estate section.

373
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:07,779
And then you can drive
people around all day

374
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,538
talking about...

375
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:14,978
gosh, what would you talk about?

376
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,418
Crown molding?

377
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:23,898
I'll definitely talk about
crown molding.

378
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,579
Um, square footage.

379
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,538
Oh, yeah.

380
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,378
- Property easements.
- Oh, yeah.

381
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,859
- Appliances.
- Yes.

382
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,973
- Come on, what else? Come on.
- You're crazy.

383
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,698
Come on, what?

384
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,299
Why did you pick Heather?

385
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,298
What?

386
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,539
Why did you pick her?

387
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,019
Come on, you know
it wasn't like that.

388
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,419
How was it like?

389
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,419
Okay, if this is gonna get all...

390
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,739
No no, don't.

391
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,419
Okay?

392
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:25,380
How long is this gonna take?

393
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:27,300
All we have to do is go in there

394
00:22:27,301 --> 00:22:30,859
and throw everything away... cake.

395
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,419
Oh. Oh my God.

396
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,340
I think it just takes
a little getting used to.

397
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:42,140
Just give it some time.

398
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:06,699
Great. Now we're gonna have to
clean that up too.

399
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,500
We need to get the stink out.

400
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,740
What do we do with that?

401
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:28,540
Dumpster.

402
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,699
Come on.

403
00:23:35,462 --> 00:23:38,500
Oh, God, it smells bad.

404
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:41,941
Slow down. Fuck, Rose,
just slow down.

405
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:44,101
- I'm not going fast, Norah.
- You are going fast.

406
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:46,021
No, I'm not. How can I be
walking faster than you?

407
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:47,701
I'm walking backwards.
I have the hard job.

408
00:23:47,702 --> 00:23:50,021
You're in control of it.
You're the one pulling it.

409
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:53,141
- How can I pulling it?
- I haven't got a good grip on it, Rose.

410
00:23:53,142 --> 00:23:54,901
- Fucking slow down.
- Here.

411
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:59,380
Oh my God, Rose,
you fucking idiot.

412
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:02,700
My face is burning.

413
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:07,541
You know what?
You fucking do it yourself, dumb-ass.

414
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:09,940
- Norah, come on.
- Do it on your own, idiot.

415
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:12,460
It'll wash out.

416
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,941
Where did you get those?
What are you doing with those?

417
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,861
I found them in the closet.

418
00:24:25,862 --> 00:24:28,901
Let me take a look at them
for a minute.

419
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:30,541
Let me see them.

420
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,661
Let me look at them.
They're not yours, Oscar.

421
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:35,101
Let me look at them.

422
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:38,582
You'd better let me hang onto these
for a while, Oscar.

423
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,061
Why?

424
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,301
Because they belonged
to your grandma.

425
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:44,101
But I don't have a grandma.

426
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:48,180
Well, you used to have one. And when
you had one, these were her glasses.

427
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,621
- I'll get you another pair.
- Really?

428
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:53,461
Yeah, I'll get you a better pair
than this.

429
00:24:53,462 --> 00:24:56,781
Okay.

430
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:03,461
I think it, like, seems wrong

431
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:06,861
to throw everything away
like we're erasing her, you know.

432
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:09,781
It's our job.

433
00:25:14,982 --> 00:25:17,301
I bet this is her.
I bet that's her.

434
00:25:17,302 --> 00:25:20,581
Probably.

435
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:29,261
Look at this.
Rose, look at this.

436
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:34,701
It's her daughter, I think.

437
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:39,142
Shouldn't we do something,
like try and find her or something?

438
00:25:39,143 --> 00:25:42,822
It's none of our business, Norah.

439
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:45,821
What? What? What?

440
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:48,582
Just give me the dustpan.

441
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:51,662
I got it.

442
00:25:56,943 --> 00:25:59,142
What if she doesn't know?

443
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:02,902
I mean, wouldn't you want to know
if this was Mom?

444
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:07,622
Mom was not like this.
Mom never would have been like this.

445
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:08,903
- Winston.
- Hi.

446
00:27:08,904 --> 00:27:11,343
Hi. I spoke with you on the phone.
I'm Rose Lorkowski.

447
00:27:11,344 --> 00:27:13,303
- Hi, Rose. How are you doing?
- Hello.

448
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:17,022
So our situation is that...

449
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,784
we are doing some post-mortem

450
00:27:21,785 --> 00:27:23,903
kind of specialized cleanup stuff

451
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:26,623
- and we had this really difficult...
- Smelly.

452
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:28,383
...really smelly job

453
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,343
where this woman had died
and she'd been there for a while.

454
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:32,023
A decomp.

455
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:34,343
Yes, a decomp.

456
00:27:34,344 --> 00:27:35,863
Follow me.

457
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,703
The lingo, I guess.

458
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:41,983
You have your
general-purpose cleaners,

459
00:27:41,984 --> 00:27:44,303
your extraction cleaners,
your odor control,

460
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:47,544
disinfectants, stain removers
and shampoos.

461
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:50,264
Steamers, buffers, foggers...
that kind of stuff's right here

462
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:51,944
for rent or purchase.

463
00:27:51,945 --> 00:27:55,224
And quick-absorbing sawdust...
it's good for vomit.

464
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:57,664
Personal protective gear
is right there.

465
00:27:57,665 --> 00:27:59,983
If you have any questions,
come find me.

466
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:04,944
- Cut it out.
- Let's get what we need.

467
00:28:04,945 --> 00:28:08,863
Suits, protective wear or something.

468
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:12,304
Just go over there.

469
00:28:12,305 --> 00:28:14,904
- I'm on it.
- Just get stuff.

470
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:18,384
- Winston.
- Hey, how are you doing, Carl?

471
00:28:18,385 --> 00:28:21,064
Did you hear there's a couple
of amateurs poaching jobs?

472
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,823
No, I didn't.

473
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:25,064
Bruce said they did a decomp
for 500 bucks.

474
00:28:25,065 --> 00:28:26,864
- 500?
- Yeah.

475
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:29,224
What do you want to bet they threw
all that shit right in the dumpster?

476
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:31,664
Well, I certainly hope not.
What else you got there?

477
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:35,344
I got five gallons of Quick-Dissolve
and this here.

478
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:38,104
- Have a good day.
- You too, brother. See you soon, Carl.

479
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:45,583
Rose.

480
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:52,184
One, two, three, four, five of those.

481
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:53,864
Five.

482
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,545
I have that puzzle.

483
00:28:56,546 --> 00:28:59,344
It's a tough one.

484
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:03,344
I got lost in the fur and gave up.

485
00:29:04,305 --> 00:29:06,265
That's $68.24.

486
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:08,464
Do you like cats?

487
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:14,144
Nice going. You freaked him out.

488
00:29:14,145 --> 00:29:16,505
I asked him if he liked cats.
I was being nice.

489
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,504
You want to bring these back
when you're done...

490
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:23,064
rules and regulations,
biohazard cleanup, you know?

491
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:26,425
For you.

492
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:29,744
How much was that again?

493
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:35,225
Turns out it's against the law
to throw biohazards in the dumpster.

494
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:37,305
Who knew?

495
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:41,264
How perfect was he
with the one arm?

496
00:29:41,265 --> 00:29:42,504
Hmm?

497
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:46,225
The creepy guy, you know.
I wonder if he was born like that.

498
00:29:46,226 --> 00:29:47,665
He wasn't creepy.

499
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:49,904
Dude, he has one arm.

500
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:53,425
They think we're a couple of hacks.

501
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:55,945
We are a couple of hacks.

502
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:57,865
Oh, okay, here it is.

503
00:29:57,866 --> 00:29:59,425
Let me out here.

504
00:29:59,426 --> 00:30:00,505
Why?

505
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:02,985
Because I got shit to do, okay?

506
00:30:02,986 --> 00:30:05,105
I got a thing.

507
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:09,385
I'm dropping Oscar off at 7:00.

508
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:11,065
You got class tonight?

509
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:13,466
Mortgage Lenders and Financing.

510
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:15,865
Mortgage Lenders?

511
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:20,625
Well, Heather's pregnant again.

512
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,745
Do you know that?

513
00:30:24,746 --> 00:30:27,545
He's never gonna leave her.

514
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:32,145
You're pathetic.

515
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:55,146
"Wiseman".

516
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,746
Why are you following me?

517
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:42,826
I'm not following you.

518
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:44,827
- You're following me.
- No.

519
00:31:44,828 --> 00:31:47,466
- You're following me.
- No, I'm not.

520
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:50,346
- You're not?
- Following you... no.

521
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:57,546
I'm sorry.

522
00:31:58,188 --> 00:32:00,346
I really thought
you were following me.

523
00:32:00,347 --> 00:32:02,866
It's all right.

524
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:07,066
Now it's not moving.

525
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,627
Maybe if we push the alarm.

526
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:15,267
I'm sure it'll start up in a minute.

527
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,267
Again, I'm really sorry.

528
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:31,387
Don't even worry about it.

529
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:37,787
You have nice veins.

530
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:44,787
You should give blood.

531
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,787
Yeah, could you check
if there's any messages for me?

532
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:08,147
Room 211.

533
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:12,268
Okay.

534
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:15,188
Thank you.

535
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:21,267
I am strong.

536
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:24,827
I am powerful.

537
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:27,948
I am a fucking loser.

538
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:39,028
"Sunshine Cleaning".

539
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:40,989
Yes, I thought we'd put
a positive spin on things.

540
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,829
- Nice.
- My son drew the design.

541
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,629
Hi there. That's a real nice job
you did there.

542
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,668
Um, where's your arm?

543
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,029
- Oscar.
- That's all right.

544
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,308
- I'm sorry.
- Kids.

545
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:53,709
- Kids.
- He's cute.

546
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,989
Thank you.

547
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,989
I was hoping that I could put
some of these out by the register.

548
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,789
Yes, sure.
Put them right over there.

549
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,469
This is great, but you guys
might want to consider

550
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,469
getting out there and really
marketing yourselves.

551
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,709
Marketing ourselves like...?

552
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,069
Like funeral homes,
property managers.

553
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,109
You can get in with insurance companies.
They'll throw you a ton of work.

554
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,069
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

555
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,029
- Insurance companies?
- Oh, yeah.

556
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,628
That's a really good idea.

557
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,589
You guys have your BBP, right?

558
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,309
A BB-what?

559
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,909
Your BBP... bloodborne pathogens
certification.

560
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:33,269
No, I don't.

561
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,144
I could sign you up
for the next seminar if you'd like.

562
00:35:40,145 --> 00:35:43,150
- Yeah, I'd like.
- Okay.

563
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:44,630
- Thank you.
- You're welcome,

564
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:47,749
Rose from Sunshine Cleaning.
You gotta love that.

565
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,189
Sorry.

566
00:35:59,151 --> 00:36:02,350
I think you're gonna like
this Econoline.

567
00:36:02,351 --> 00:36:04,670
The girls have gone into their own
business, Sherm.

568
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:07,150
They're doing crime scene
and trauma cleanup.

569
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:10,510
- It's a real growth industry.
- Sounds kind of gory.

570
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:12,590
Yeah, it can be. It can be.

571
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:15,790
We're gonna be taking some contaminated
materials to the incinerator,

572
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:17,749
so we're gonna need
some space in the back.

573
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,350
- There you go.
- How much is it?

574
00:36:20,351 --> 00:36:22,590
It's $1999.

575
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:26,030
Whoa. Any room
to come down on that?

576
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:27,950
Oh, that's the ground floor.

577
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,270
I'm probably gonna lose money
on this one.

578
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,110
I just want to make room
for some new product.

579
00:36:32,111 --> 00:36:34,030
We can pay cash.

580
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:36,510
We have some cash.
We have some cash we can put down.

581
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:37,670
Cash is good.

582
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:39,510
What about all this rust here
on the thing?

583
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:41,390
- Character.
- That's bullshit.

584
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:43,511
We were just at Motor Mart
down on Lomas.

585
00:36:43,512 --> 00:36:47,751
They had a Chevy G-series
for $1900.

586
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:49,230
Power steering?

587
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:51,150
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

588
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:53,070
What's this?

589
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:55,390
Oh, that's a CB.
What you do with that is

590
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:58,871
you push down on that thing
and hold that other thing down

591
00:36:58,872 --> 00:37:01,830
and it makes your voice go up
in radio waves.

592
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:03,710
It goes right into the heavens.

593
00:37:03,711 --> 00:37:05,910
- Heaven?
- Uh-huh.

594
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:08,630
How about a test drive?

595
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:10,430
There you go.

596
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:29,591
And don't forget about
some personal protective equipment.

597
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:54,672
Oh, shit.

598
00:38:54,673 --> 00:38:57,311
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

599
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:09,751
What, you think I don't know?

600
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:13,392
You may have been hot shit
in high school.

601
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:16,152
What are you now, hmm?

602
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:21,752
Nothing.

603
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:33,713
Okay, you got 20 bucks
and you want to buy three pizzas.

604
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:36,993
The pizzas cost $3 apiece.

605
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:39,473
No, let's make that $5 apiece.

606
00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:42,033
You got a coupon that takes $2 off.

607
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:44,432
Okay, $2.

608
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:47,312
The delivery boy shows up.

609
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:50,113
He's a friend from school
who's very very poor,

610
00:39:50,114 --> 00:39:51,953
so you give him a tip
of five bucks.

611
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:53,993
- Okay, $5.
- What do you end up with?

612
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:58,753
Okay, you have $2 left,
and you spent $18.

613
00:39:58,754 --> 00:40:01,032
You just figured that out?

614
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:03,832
Yeah, it's not that hard.

615
00:40:05,674 --> 00:40:07,833
Here's Frank.

616
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:23,153
That's it. There's our shrimp.

617
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,033
They look pretty damn good.

618
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:27,433
Shove them in there.

619
00:40:27,434 --> 00:40:29,992
How many boxes we got?

620
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,913
See? That's the difference
between an ordinary person

621
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:38,594
and a person
with business acumen.

622
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:40,553
That's a good word for you to remember...

623
00:40:40,554 --> 00:40:42,233
business acumen.

624
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:45,312
We're gonna be rich, pal.

625
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:54,233
We're gonna make some money grow
because that's the smart way.

626
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:57,273
It's capital, and you don't spend that.
You invest it.

627
00:40:57,274 --> 00:41:01,314
So that way we can get the new SP250
and have money left over.

628
00:41:01,315 --> 00:41:02,434
What are you talking about?

629
00:41:02,435 --> 00:41:05,913
The binoculars Grandpa's getting me
for my birthday.

630
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:09,953
What binoculars Grandpa's
getting you for your birthday?

631
00:41:12,794 --> 00:41:14,594
These binoculars.

632
00:41:14,595 --> 00:41:17,273
They've got some internal
stabilizer thing. It's electronic.

633
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,834
So that way if you're on a speedboat
or something, it won't matter.

634
00:41:19,835 --> 00:41:22,554
And when it's really cold outside,
they won't freeze, so...

635
00:41:22,555 --> 00:41:24,754
Honey, honey, come here.

636
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:26,034
Listen to me.

637
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:28,393
Sometimes Grandpa
promises things

638
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:31,514
and he really wants
to make it happen, you know?

639
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:33,394
No, he's really gonna get them.

640
00:41:33,395 --> 00:41:35,594
He has a plan.

641
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:37,754
- He has a plan?
- Mm-hmm.

642
00:41:37,755 --> 00:41:40,314
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

643
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:44,433
Okay, if you say so.

644
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:47,554
Squeeze that for me.

645
00:41:47,555 --> 00:41:49,914
Again.

646
00:41:49,915 --> 00:41:52,794
Don't be nervous.
People do this all the time.

647
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:56,074
I'm not nervous. I'm fine.

648
00:41:56,756 --> 00:41:59,314
Oh, that's the needle?

649
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:01,914
That's a fucking cocktail straw.

650
00:42:01,915 --> 00:42:04,114
Trust me. I'm really good at this.

651
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:11,955
Okay.

652
00:42:11,956 --> 00:42:13,394
Wasn't that fun?

653
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:16,274
I think you might have oversold it.

654
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:26,954
There's a thing tonight...

655
00:42:26,955 --> 00:42:28,914
oh, never mind.

656
00:42:28,915 --> 00:42:31,115
- What?
- No, it's nothing.

657
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:35,074
It's just my friend...

658
00:42:36,476 --> 00:42:38,235
- What is it?
- You wouldn't like it.

659
00:42:38,236 --> 00:42:40,475
I might like it.

660
00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:46,595
I knew you wouldn't have
any fun here.

661
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:48,754
No, I'm having a good time.

662
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:51,354
It's okay.

663
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:55,675
Oh, no, thanks.

664
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:57,955
It's just lamb's breath. It's mellow.

665
00:42:57,956 --> 00:42:59,835
Yeah, thanks.

666
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:02,435
Straight edge?

667
00:43:02,436 --> 00:43:05,754
No, I'm just...

668
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,915
What?

669
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:10,949
You'll just think it's weird.

670
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,915
What? No, I like weird stuff.

671
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:15,195
Okay.

672
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:18,675
Well, sometimes I think that
when you get high or when you drink,

673
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:21,115
- when you alter your consciousness...
- You don't drink either?

674
00:43:21,116 --> 00:43:24,555
No. I just think that when you do
stuff like that,

675
00:43:24,556 --> 00:43:27,875
it weakens you psychically,
like it creates cracks

676
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:30,635
and then bad stuff
can seep into those cracks

677
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:33,956
and maybe never go away.

678
00:43:33,957 --> 00:43:35,995
That's so weird.

679
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:38,916
Sorry.

680
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:42,275
You should probably just
tell people you're a Mormon.

681
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:45,715
Maybe.

682
00:43:49,637 --> 00:43:53,996
Your boyfriend's winning
the necklace game.

683
00:43:54,357 --> 00:43:57,675
He's not really my boyfriend.

684
00:43:58,757 --> 00:44:01,916
You just tickle my neck a little bit.

685
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:04,836
I'm totally gonna win.

686
00:44:08,677 --> 00:44:12,875
You still have your whole necklace.

687
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:21,676
I like the white ones.

688
00:44:22,757 --> 00:44:25,396
I'm gonna try a white one.

689
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:41,076
It's pretty good.

690
00:44:41,077 --> 00:44:46,156
I need some beer.

691
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:57,396
- What are you doing?
- This is Cary Fleming live at the scene

692
00:44:57,397 --> 00:45:00,156
at Wyoming Indian School.
Tragedy struck today

693
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:02,957
when an out-of-control driver
crashed into this autoshop

694
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:04,116
killing one employee.

695
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:06,076
The driver of the automobile...

696
00:45:06,077 --> 00:45:08,116
apparently suffered a heart attack
at the wheel

697
00:45:08,117 --> 00:45:09,957
- and is in critical condition.
- Hello.

698
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:12,037
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, I'm watching it now.

699
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:14,997
Okay. All right.

700
00:45:14,998 --> 00:45:17,077
Okay.

701
00:45:17,078 --> 00:45:19,037
Dude, get off.

702
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:26,677
The guy's driving down here
and has a heart attack,

703
00:45:26,678 --> 00:45:29,117
comes right through the front window
at a high rate of speed,

704
00:45:29,118 --> 00:45:30,996
and hits one of the employees
in here.

705
00:45:30,997 --> 00:45:33,957
The poor guy's in about five pieces
and there's quite a bit of blood.

706
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,837
You guys are BBP-certified, right?

707
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:38,117
We adhere to all proper procedures
when handling

708
00:45:38,118 --> 00:45:40,797
potentially hazardous situations.
We're very professional.

709
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:43,517
- I thought you went to that thing.
- I did. I'm not done yet.

710
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:48,152
It's fine, trust me. If you could get
the Wet Vac and the Burnbox...

711
00:45:48,153 --> 00:45:50,072
Are you guys all finished up in there?

712
00:45:50,073 --> 00:45:51,477
Yeah.

713
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:55,197
Great, then I can handle it
from here, can't I?

714
00:46:09,038 --> 00:46:11,797
What's a "bastard"?
Jeremy told me I was a bastard.

715
00:46:11,798 --> 00:46:14,237
So what's a "bastard"?

716
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:17,677
It just means your mom wasn't married
when she had you.

717
00:46:17,678 --> 00:46:19,157
It's no big deal.

718
00:46:19,158 --> 00:46:21,517
You know, in a couple of years
you're gonna find

719
00:46:21,518 --> 00:46:25,077
it's a free pass to cool, all right?

720
00:46:25,078 --> 00:46:29,518
You'll probably start a band
called Bastard Son,

721
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:32,558
use it to impress the chicks.

722
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:35,278
The whole bastard thing
is working for you.

723
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:37,558
You're the coolest bastard I know.

724
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,238
- Really?
- Yeah.

725
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,638
Hello. Sunshine Cleaning.

726
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:45,078
Of course.

727
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:49,078
2327 Grove Avenue.

728
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:51,318
Okay, we got it.

729
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:52,958
No, thank you.

730
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:54,678
All right, goodbye.

731
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:56,878
What was that?

732
00:46:56,879 --> 00:46:59,798
A suicide.

733
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:05,757
It's a good thing.

734
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:13,798
Oh, man.

735
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:16,398
Okay.

736
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:19,358
Stay in the van, okay?

737
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:23,078
If you get thirsty, there's some soda
in the blue cooler, okay, sweetie?

738
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,198
Okay.

739
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:29,918
Hi. Mrs. Davis?

740
00:47:29,919 --> 00:47:31,079
Yes.

741
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,398
We're the cleaning crew.

742
00:47:33,399 --> 00:47:36,798
Yes, I wanted to give you the keys.

743
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:38,639
Okay.

744
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,679
In the den

745
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,639
where my husband...

746
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,598
I had bread.

747
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:46,879
And when I...

748
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,239
Do you need me to show you?

749
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,679
Oh, no no no.

750
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,639
We can find it.

751
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,718
Okay, that's good then.

752
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,959
My son-in-law is coming

753
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,159
to take me to lunch
at the Howard Johnson's.

754
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,758
They have such nice rolls
at the Howard Johnson's.

755
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,359
Um...

756
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,758
Mrs. Davis.

757
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,959
Mrs. Davis,

758
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,639
would you like me to sit with you
for a little while?

759
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,759
Yes, dear.

760
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,720
I believe I would.

761
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:31,358
Okay.

762
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:44,640
Bye.

763
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:52,760
Is she okay?

764
00:49:52,761 --> 00:49:54,920
Yeah, she'll be okay.

765
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:11,640
Why is that lady so sad?

766
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,881
Well, her husband died

767
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:15,760
and she misses him.

768
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:17,881
Maybe we could let her
use our CB.

769
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:20,320
And then she could talk to him.

770
00:50:26,642 --> 00:50:28,961
Tengo mariscos para ustedes

771
00:50:28,962 --> 00:50:31,480
at a very good,
very very good price.

772
00:50:31,481 --> 00:50:35,320
Cien dÃ³lares para usted y...

773
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:37,641
I can give you a deal.

774
00:50:37,642 --> 00:50:39,601
Smell these shrimp.

775
00:50:39,602 --> 00:50:42,200
Take a whiff of these shrimp.

776
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:44,240
Yeah, it's good.

777
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,201
- Oh, no.
- ¿Por qué no?

778
00:50:46,202 --> 00:50:47,800
No no no.

779
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:50,081
No no, digame.

780
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:02,801
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

781
00:51:02,802 --> 00:51:05,441
Norah, is that you?

782
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:06,841
Yeah.

783
00:51:06,842 --> 00:51:10,321
Have you ever been trestling?

784
00:51:16,922 --> 00:51:20,041
So when you're at the crime scenes,
are the bodies still there?

785
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:22,001
No, the bodies are gone.

786
00:51:22,002 --> 00:51:23,962
But it's weird, you know,

787
00:51:23,963 --> 00:51:25,882
'cause we're, like,
connected to them

788
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:29,081
in a strangely intimate way.

789
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:31,362
And, I don't know,

790
00:51:31,363 --> 00:51:33,961
I guess it's weird.

791
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,801
I have seen a dead body once, though.

792
00:51:46,802 --> 00:51:48,441
Really?

793
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:50,601
My mom.

794
00:51:52,962 --> 00:51:56,156
She was in a Movie of the Week once,
you know.

795
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:58,522
- Really?
- Yeah.

796
00:51:58,523 --> 00:52:01,842
There was this bunch
of Hollywood people

797
00:52:01,843 --> 00:52:04,522
and they were filming
in Old Town.

798
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:06,482
And they saw my mom

799
00:52:06,483 --> 00:52:08,642
and they just thought
she was beautiful

800
00:52:08,643 --> 00:52:11,962
and talented,
'cause they gave her a speaking part.

801
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:13,162
Oh, yeah?

802
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,442
- Do you want to hear it?
- Mm-hmm.

803
00:52:15,443 --> 00:52:17,722
"I recommend the pecan pie".

804
00:52:17,723 --> 00:52:20,842
"I recommend
the pecan pie".

805
00:52:20,843 --> 00:52:24,642
Yeah, that was her line.
That was it.

806
00:52:24,643 --> 00:52:27,083
That's pretty cool.

807
00:52:27,084 --> 00:52:30,322
It was on TV and everything.

808
00:52:34,683 --> 00:52:37,042
Me and Rose didn't see it.

809
00:52:37,043 --> 00:52:41,442
But Rose said that Mom
talked about it all the time.

810
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:45,402
I don't remember.

811
00:52:45,883 --> 00:52:49,802
I don't remember her much at all.

812
00:52:51,803 --> 00:52:54,842
But I have a box of her stuff.

813
00:52:54,843 --> 00:52:57,483
Um...

814
00:52:57,484 --> 00:53:00,002
it's just things that she touched

815
00:53:00,003 --> 00:53:04,162
and little things.

816
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:07,523
How did she die?

817
00:53:09,564 --> 00:53:13,442
It was a do-it-yourself kind of thing.

818
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:19,482
I think the train's coming.

819
00:53:19,483 --> 00:53:21,443
Yeah.

820
00:53:21,444 --> 00:53:23,403
Yeah. Yes, it is.

821
00:53:23,404 --> 00:53:25,483
Oh, yeah, okay.
So this is where we climb

822
00:53:25,484 --> 00:53:29,002
up to that girder.

823
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:39,003
What was I before I was born?

824
00:53:44,124 --> 00:53:47,363
What happens when we die?

825
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:52,603
I'm not climbing up there.

826
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,883
Come on, this is trestling.

827
00:53:54,884 --> 00:53:57,844
This is what it's all about.

828
00:53:57,845 --> 00:54:01,723
It's like this big pissed-off God

829
00:54:01,724 --> 00:54:04,763
and he's right up in your face,
like, screaming at you, you know?

830
00:54:04,764 --> 00:54:08,284
He's so close,
you can smell the metal on his breath.

831
00:54:08,285 --> 00:54:11,404
If you already live in heaven,

832
00:54:11,405 --> 00:54:14,643
where do you go when you die?

833
00:54:26,004 --> 00:54:29,283
Whoo!

834
00:54:32,925 --> 00:54:37,283
Whoo!

835
00:54:52,324 --> 00:54:55,404
Can you see
everything down here?

836
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:44,084
Rose.

837
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:49,205
Hey, beautiful.

838
00:55:49,206 --> 00:55:51,044
Hi.

839
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:58,605
I started thinking that you were
on a date or something.

840
00:55:58,606 --> 00:56:02,404
I was...

841
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,245
I got you something.

842
00:56:05,246 --> 00:56:06,845
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

843
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:09,445
It's for your business cards.

844
00:56:09,446 --> 00:56:13,125
You put your cards in there

845
00:56:13,126 --> 00:56:17,764
and, I don't know, impress people.

846
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:21,885
It's beautiful.

847
00:56:21,886 --> 00:56:25,125
You don't like it?

848
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:28,605
Look, this thing

849
00:56:28,606 --> 00:56:32,485
that we've been doing...
it's not...

850
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:37,285
Let's not do that.

851
00:56:39,326 --> 00:56:42,405
I don't want this anymore.

852
00:56:45,727 --> 00:56:47,845
So that's it.

853
00:57:03,127 --> 00:57:06,085
That's it then.

854
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:32,206
Brown or flowery?

855
00:57:32,207 --> 00:57:33,646
Brown.

856
00:57:33,647 --> 00:57:34,926
- Sure?
- Mm-hmm.

857
00:57:34,927 --> 00:57:37,246
All right, good call.

858
00:57:37,247 --> 00:57:39,406
Okay, go get your stuff together,
please.

859
00:57:39,407 --> 00:57:41,246
Okay.

860
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:43,806
Thank you.

861
00:57:46,687 --> 00:57:48,886
Sunshine Cleaning.

862
00:57:48,887 --> 00:57:50,607
Hello, this is Henry Schmeer,
State Farm.

863
00:57:50,608 --> 00:57:52,966
State Farm. Oh, State Farm. Hi.

864
00:57:52,967 --> 00:57:56,006
- I spoke with you about a month ago.
- Yeah, what can I do for you?

865
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:58,366
We've got a house we need to turn around
and our regular guys

866
00:57:58,367 --> 00:58:00,966
are busy in Santa Fe today.
I thought I'd give you a call.

867
00:58:00,967 --> 00:58:02,527
Today?

868
00:58:02,528 --> 00:58:05,566
The house on 60 Howard Avenue

869
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:08,206
in Antelope Springs.

870
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:10,526
All right. All right, thank you.

871
00:58:10,527 --> 00:58:11,967
Bye-bye.

872
00:58:11,968 --> 00:58:13,047
Shit.

873
00:58:13,048 --> 00:58:14,646
Blow off the shower.

874
00:58:14,647 --> 00:58:17,126
I can't blow it off. I RSVP'd.

875
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:21,167
- Just tell them we can't do it, Rose.
- This is an insurance company, Norah.

876
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,286
They can throw us a ton of business.
This is our in.

877
00:58:23,287 --> 00:58:27,207
Yes, it's our in.
So don't go to the damn baby shower.

878
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:29,286
Norah, these are my old buddies
from high school.

879
00:58:29,287 --> 00:58:31,766
It's really important to me.
Just go and get it started

880
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:34,246
and I promise I will come
and help you finish it up, okay?

881
00:58:34,247 --> 00:58:37,566
- Fine. Fine.
- Thanks.

882
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:44,527
- Oh, pee-yew.
- Stay out here.

883
00:58:44,528 --> 00:58:47,447
- But why do I always...?
- Because I said so. Stay here.

884
00:58:50,168 --> 00:58:52,647
Dad.

885
00:58:52,648 --> 00:58:55,247
Daddy.

886
00:58:55,248 --> 00:58:58,567
Shit. Dad.

887
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,447
Oh, shit.

888
00:59:00,448 --> 00:59:01,847
Damn it, you scared
the shit out of me.

889
00:59:01,848 --> 00:59:04,247
I'm busy here.

890
00:59:06,048 --> 00:59:08,927
Dad, what are you doing?

891
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:11,807
The goddamn restaurant bastards
wouldn't buy my shrimp,

892
00:59:11,808 --> 00:59:14,687
giving me this crap about
the Board of Health or some bullshit.

893
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:17,487
They shut me out.
They just shut me out.

894
00:59:17,488 --> 00:59:21,407
They got some kind of goddamn
restaurant syndicate, I'm sure of it.

895
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:29,448
Dad, I need you
to watch Oscar today.

896
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:31,768
- I can't.
- Why?

897
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:33,728
I can't. I'm busy today.

898
00:59:33,729 --> 00:59:35,608
Dad, come on, I'm kind of
in a bind right now.

899
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:38,088
Yeah, well, it's tough bringing up a kid
by yourself, isn't it?

900
00:59:38,089 --> 00:59:40,728
Try two.

901
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:56,247
I'm over here.

902
00:59:56,248 --> 00:59:58,008
Hi.

903
00:59:58,009 --> 01:00:01,848
Hi. I was wondering
if Oscar could hang out here with you

904
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:03,808
for a while.

905
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,448
I don't...

906
01:00:05,449 --> 01:00:08,688
See, I have this baby shower thing

907
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:12,568
and Norah has a job
and my dad is incapacitated.

908
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:15,968
So would that be okay?

909
01:00:15,969 --> 01:00:18,088
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

910
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:20,488
You are a lifesaver.

911
01:00:20,489 --> 01:00:23,768
You did your hair different.

912
01:00:23,769 --> 01:00:26,168
Yeah, I did.

913
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:27,928
Do you like it?
It's, you know...

914
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:29,528
Yeah, I do.

915
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:32,608
- All right, you be good, okay?
- Okay.

916
01:00:32,609 --> 01:00:34,928
You be good.
And I will be back

917
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:37,328
as soon as I'm done
with everything.

918
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:39,608
Okay. You good? You okay?

919
01:00:39,609 --> 01:00:41,408
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

920
01:00:41,409 --> 01:00:42,648
You're welcome.

921
01:00:42,649 --> 01:00:45,448
You'll do good, Rose. Okay.

922
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:49,048
All right. A Porsche... great.

923
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:55,448
Hi, it's good to see you.

924
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:59,808
Everybody is here. Fantastic.

925
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:05,568
Hello, everybody.

926
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:36,049
Ugh.

927
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:04,010
So, Rose, how are you doing?
Are you still cleaning houses?

928
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,289
No, that was just a temporary thing.

929
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:08,769
Rose has gone into real estate.

930
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:09,890
Really?

931
01:02:09,891 --> 01:02:12,729
Actually, I own my own business.

932
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,610
Oh, what kind?
Is it a real estate business?

933
01:02:14,611 --> 01:02:18,530
No, it's a biohazard removal

934
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:20,730
and crime-scene cleanup service.

935
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:23,250
It's a real growth niche industry.

936
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:25,449
It's highly competitive and technical.

937
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,690
And what is that exactly...

938
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:30,330
a biohazard removal whatever?

939
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:33,210
Well, a lot of times

940
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:35,170
when people die,

941
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:37,129
it can be kind of messy, you know.

942
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,050
So what we do is, we go in
and we clean up the mess

943
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:44,129
and make sure that everything
is clean and sanitary.

944
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:47,090
'Cause people don't realize
the safety risks

945
01:02:47,091 --> 01:02:50,770
involved with the removal
of blood and body fluid.

946
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:54,570
I cannot imagine.

947
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:56,610
You like doing it?

948
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:58,970
Yeah.

949
01:02:58,971 --> 01:03:01,651
I do.

950
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:05,010
Um, we come into people's lives

951
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:09,690
when they have experienced
something profound and sad...

952
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:13,171
they've lost somebody, you know?

953
01:03:13,172 --> 01:03:16,571
And the circumstances...

954
01:03:16,572 --> 01:03:18,330
they're always different,

955
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:20,291
but that's the same.

956
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:24,410
And we help.

957
01:03:26,332 --> 01:03:29,690
In some small way, we...

958
01:03:29,691 --> 01:03:33,370
we help.

959
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:46,771
What's that?

960
01:03:46,772 --> 01:03:48,730
That is a propeller.

961
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:51,491
And when I'm done prepping this wing,
it will go on the end.

962
01:03:51,492 --> 01:03:52,931
Like that?

963
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:54,451
Yeah.

964
01:03:54,452 --> 01:03:56,771
It doesn't fly.

965
01:03:56,772 --> 01:04:00,051
Right, like my helicopter.

966
01:04:05,452 --> 01:04:09,290
Must be hard to build models
with just one hand.

967
01:04:10,532 --> 01:04:12,491
It is.

968
01:04:14,212 --> 01:04:16,850
Yeah.

969
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:33,091
No no no no no.

970
01:04:33,092 --> 01:04:36,331
Come on, kitty.

971
01:04:39,172 --> 01:04:41,891
Here, kitty kitty kitty.

972
01:04:42,693 --> 01:04:45,491
Good kitty. Good kitty.

973
01:04:45,492 --> 01:04:47,451
Come on.

974
01:04:47,452 --> 01:04:49,692
Aww, did you get left behind?

975
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:52,091
You are the sweetest thing.

976
01:04:52,092 --> 01:04:55,052
You are the cutest thing ever.

977
01:04:55,053 --> 01:04:59,051
Did you get left behind,
little kitty kitty kitty?

978
01:05:01,807 --> 01:05:04,212
Oh, shit. Um, uh...

979
01:05:04,213 --> 01:05:06,731
um...

980
01:05:06,732 --> 01:05:08,692
shit.

981
01:05:08,693 --> 01:05:11,811
Okay, can you stay there?

982
01:05:11,812 --> 01:05:13,931
Oh my God.

983
01:05:19,973 --> 01:05:22,411
Come on.

984
01:05:22,933 --> 01:05:26,891
Fuck. Fuck.

985
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,651
Fuck.

986
01:05:35,493 --> 01:05:38,852
Oh, please, help!

987
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:42,572
No, God damn it!

988
01:05:42,573 --> 01:05:45,412
I've taken five different
chocolate bars

989
01:05:45,413 --> 01:05:47,292
and melted them
in these diapers.

990
01:05:47,293 --> 01:05:51,052
You can taste, look and smell.

991
01:05:51,053 --> 01:05:53,692
And the first to guess
all five correctly, wins.

992
01:05:53,693 --> 01:05:56,692
Crunchy.
Crunchy poop.

993
01:06:00,533 --> 01:06:02,692
Um, Paula,

994
01:06:02,693 --> 01:06:05,092
I'm sorry, I need to go.

995
01:06:05,093 --> 01:06:07,532
There's somewhere
that I need to be.

996
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:11,212
No, you can't leave now.
We're just starting to play the games.

997
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:14,212
Yeah, well,

998
01:06:14,213 --> 01:06:17,772
yeah.

999
01:06:44,974 --> 01:06:46,973
Oh, no.

1000
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:53,052
Norah!

1001
01:06:53,854 --> 01:06:56,332
Norah!

1002
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:59,693
Fuck. Norah.

1003
01:06:59,694 --> 01:07:02,173
Norah,

1004
01:07:02,174 --> 01:07:04,373
what happened?

1005
01:07:04,374 --> 01:07:06,533
- It was an accident.
- You did this.

1006
01:07:06,534 --> 01:07:08,933
- It was an accident.
- Oh my God.

1007
01:07:08,934 --> 01:07:10,893
It was an accident, Rose.

1008
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:12,533
Oh my God.

1009
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:15,133
Norah, what the fuck happened?

1010
01:07:15,134 --> 01:07:18,853
Norah, come out here.
Get out of this car.

1011
01:07:18,854 --> 01:07:21,534
- Rose, calm down.
- I have to deal with this by myself.

1012
01:07:21,535 --> 01:07:24,173
No, I am not going to calm down.
Fuck.

1013
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:26,853
- It was an accident.
- Oh my God.

1014
01:07:46,254 --> 01:07:50,334
Winston. Winston.

1015
01:07:51,655 --> 01:07:54,174
- Sorry.
- Hey, Rose. Are you okay?

1016
01:07:54,175 --> 01:07:56,814
Just everything is really
horrible right now, you know?

1017
01:07:56,815 --> 01:07:58,614
Oscar is asleep in the back.

1018
01:07:58,615 --> 01:08:00,974
Okay, good. Good.

1019
01:08:00,975 --> 01:08:04,134
Norah ruined everything.

1020
01:08:04,135 --> 01:08:06,614
She burned down a house.

1021
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,974
A house... she burned down
a client's house.

1022
01:08:08,975 --> 01:08:10,894
Yeah.

1023
01:08:10,895 --> 01:08:12,214
How do you know?

1024
01:08:12,215 --> 01:08:14,574
Carl told me.

1025
01:08:15,576 --> 01:08:17,534
How does he know?

1026
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:21,174
It's his job.
It's what he does.

1027
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:25,049
We burned down a client's house.

1028
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:27,334
How do you get around that?

1029
01:08:27,335 --> 01:08:29,614
Insurance.

1030
01:08:31,015 --> 01:08:35,733
Oh. See, I thought I would get
a better rate once I was certified.

1031
01:08:38,095 --> 01:08:41,934
There's not a lot that I'm good at.

1032
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:46,415
I'm good at getting guys
to want me...

1033
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,855
not date me or marry me,
but want me.

1034
01:08:48,856 --> 01:08:52,575
I am good at that.

1035
01:08:52,576 --> 01:08:55,575
And...

1036
01:08:55,576 --> 01:08:57,854
and cheering.

1037
01:08:57,855 --> 01:09:01,095
I was really good at cheering.

1038
01:09:01,096 --> 01:09:04,655
Cheering is good.

1039
01:09:05,696 --> 01:09:08,854
Yeah, but it's not as marketable
as you'd think.

1040
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:29,135
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

1041
01:09:29,136 --> 01:09:31,175
Do you mind keeping an eye
on Oscar for a while?

1042
01:09:31,176 --> 01:09:32,295
Yeah, sure.

1043
01:09:32,296 --> 01:09:34,615
I just gotta go get a couple
of my shifts back.

1044
01:09:34,616 --> 01:09:37,695
Don't go back to being a maid.

1045
01:09:37,696 --> 01:09:39,735
It's not a good job for you.

1046
01:09:39,736 --> 01:09:41,935
Dad, I need a job.

1047
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:45,256
I owe, like, $40,000 on that house,
and that's on top of everything else.

1048
01:09:45,257 --> 01:09:46,455
So I just...

1049
01:09:46,456 --> 01:09:50,015
Yeah, well, you're not gonna earn
$40,000 by cleaning houses.

1050
01:09:50,016 --> 01:09:53,015
I'll figure out something to do.

1051
01:09:53,016 --> 01:09:54,895
I will.

1052
01:09:54,896 --> 01:09:57,135
Can I make a sandwich?

1053
01:09:57,136 --> 01:10:00,855
Yeah, go ahead.
You know where everything is.

1054
01:10:03,097 --> 01:10:06,455
Go make up with your sister.

1055
01:10:07,017 --> 01:10:09,415
She's your sister.
Go make up with her.

1056
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:12,495
Dad, please.

1057
01:10:20,737 --> 01:10:23,015
What's this?

1058
01:10:23,016 --> 01:10:25,895
Just open it.

1059
01:10:38,537 --> 01:10:40,656
Why do you have my mom's ID?

1060
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:43,656
I found it

1061
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:45,536
at work.

1062
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:47,976
Me and Rose did a job
a while back,

1063
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:52,216
and there was a woman

1064
01:10:52,217 --> 01:10:56,296
who had...

1065
01:10:56,297 --> 01:10:58,736
look, we're supposed
to throw everything away,

1066
01:10:58,737 --> 01:11:00,776
but I mean, she kept
these pictures of you and I...

1067
01:11:00,777 --> 01:11:02,617
This is her fanny pack?

1068
01:11:02,618 --> 01:11:06,176
I couldn't throw them away.

1069
01:11:07,577 --> 01:11:10,336
You were following me that day.

1070
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:12,496
I should have told you.
I know that.

1071
01:11:12,497 --> 01:11:16,776
And I... so stupid,
I just got scared and I...

1072
01:11:18,378 --> 01:11:20,376
I didn't know what the situation was

1073
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:22,376
between you and your mom.

1074
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:24,257
I don't know what went on.

1075
01:11:24,258 --> 01:11:27,937
But I just thought that of everybody,
that I would understand.

1076
01:11:27,938 --> 01:11:29,297
You would understand?

1077
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:32,816
My mom was a pathetic drunk.

1078
01:11:35,977 --> 01:11:37,496
I'm an idiot.

1079
01:11:37,497 --> 01:11:40,657
I actually thought
that you were interested in me.

1080
01:11:40,658 --> 01:11:44,017
I just wanted
to do the right thing.

1081
01:11:44,298 --> 01:11:46,976
- Please don't.
- Don't call me.

1082
01:11:59,498 --> 01:12:01,937
- You got that?
- Yeah, it's light.

1083
01:12:01,938 --> 01:12:04,417
I'm sure I'll be able
to turn this around pretty quick.

1084
01:12:04,418 --> 01:12:07,617
Thank you for everything.

1085
01:12:08,298 --> 01:12:10,897
Are you coming to my party?

1086
01:12:10,898 --> 01:12:13,817
We're having Oscar's birthday party

1087
01:12:13,818 --> 01:12:16,457
at Hinkle's on Saturday.
It'd be great if you came.

1088
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,097
Sounds like a blast.

1089
01:12:18,098 --> 01:12:20,217
Yes!

1090
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:28,977
I know what you're thinking, Oscar,

1091
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:31,977
but the ones we saw at the store
were full of gimmicks.

1092
01:12:31,978 --> 01:12:33,897
They didn't have the heft
that these have.

1093
01:12:33,898 --> 01:12:35,858
They didn't have the weight.
There's no history.

1094
01:12:35,859 --> 01:12:37,977
Wow, is that an old Zeiss?

1095
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:39,258
Yeah.

1096
01:12:39,259 --> 01:12:41,458
Some classic binoculars
you got there.

1097
01:12:41,459 --> 01:12:43,177
Cool.

1098
01:12:43,178 --> 01:12:47,097
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, look at you.

1099
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:49,858
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, dear.

1100
01:12:53,898 --> 01:12:55,857
Where are you going?

1101
01:13:05,098 --> 01:13:07,417
Get it together.

1102
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:21,458
Okay, I'm sorry.

1103
01:13:21,459 --> 01:13:24,778
I know that you think
that I ruined everything

1104
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:28,138
and that I fucked up really huge,
and I'm sorry, okay?

1105
01:13:28,139 --> 01:13:30,458
You know what I don't get, Norah?

1106
01:13:30,459 --> 01:13:33,378
It's that I ask you to do one thing...

1107
01:13:33,379 --> 01:13:36,178
I can't even ask you to do one thing
without you messing it up.

1108
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:38,539
I mean, Jesus, Norah, it's not like
I don't have enough

1109
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,218
to deal with in my own life, but now
I have to take care of you on top of it,

1110
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:43,339
and I can't.
It's too much. I can't do it.

1111
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,938
I'm not asking you to.

1112
01:13:44,939 --> 01:13:47,938
This business was
everything to me, Norah.

1113
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:49,418
Well, why weren't you there?

1114
01:13:49,419 --> 01:13:51,858
I was going to be there.
I told you I was gonna be there.

1115
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:54,818
You couldn't just wait
to burn the house down?

1116
01:13:54,819 --> 01:13:57,179
Yeah, but you weren't there
and I couldn't...

1117
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:00,498
I couldn't do it by myself.

1118
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,898
I just...

1119
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,219
I should have been there.
I know.

1120
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:13,779
But...

1121
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:20,379
I just...

1122
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:24,498
I really wanted to go
to that baby shower.

1123
01:14:25,899 --> 01:14:28,579
So stupid.

1124
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,098
I just didn't want those girls
looking at me like I was just a maid.

1125
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,858
You're better than them, Rose.

1126
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:44,258
What are you gonna do now?

1127
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,059
I don't know.

1128
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:49,499
They said that I could have
my old job back if I wanted.

1129
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,218
I can put in a good word for you.

1130
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:56,499
I don't need you
to take care of me anymore.

1131
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:01,938
It's not your job. It never was.

1132
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:09,299
Well, somebody had to take care
of you, Norah.

1133
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:19,859
You know what I remember
about her funeral?

1134
01:15:23,821 --> 01:15:26,819
My shoes.

1135
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:30,219
They were too small
and my feet hurt.

1136
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:33,259
That's what I remember.

1137
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,940
You know what I remember?

1138
01:15:41,781 --> 01:15:45,620
You wouldn't take your shoes off
after that.

1139
01:15:47,101 --> 01:15:51,420
You wore them forever.
It drove me crazy.

1140
01:16:05,421 --> 01:16:08,020
I'm still mad at you.

1141
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:10,660
- All right.
- Like, really mad at you.

1142
01:16:10,661 --> 01:16:13,300
Okay.

1143
01:16:13,581 --> 01:16:15,820
I hear you make model airplanes.

1144
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:18,739
Yeah.

1145
01:16:19,021 --> 01:16:20,900
Is there any money in that?

1146
01:16:20,901 --> 01:16:24,940
No, not really.

1147
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:28,181
Hey, what did you get?

1148
01:16:28,182 --> 01:16:30,781
Winston gave it to me.

1149
01:16:30,782 --> 01:16:32,821
Thank you.

1150
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:34,860
You're welcome.

1151
01:16:34,861 --> 01:16:37,420
You can open my present.

1152
01:16:37,821 --> 01:16:39,981
Okay.

1153
01:16:39,982 --> 01:16:43,180
So the guy said that if you're careful
they'll last a whole month.

1154
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,900
- So you can't shower and shit.
- That's good.

1155
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:48,461
Now these are guaranteed to make you
look like a total badass.

1156
01:16:48,462 --> 01:16:51,901
What does that say?

1157
01:16:51,902 --> 01:16:54,500
"Lil Bastard".

1158
01:16:55,582 --> 01:16:57,860
Custom-made.

1159
01:16:59,341 --> 01:17:01,620
It's cool, Norah.

1160
01:17:03,382 --> 01:17:05,741
I'm thinking of taking a road trip.

1161
01:17:05,742 --> 01:17:07,661
- Where?
- How?

1162
01:17:07,662 --> 01:17:09,261
In the van.

1163
01:17:09,262 --> 01:17:11,901
- No, I'm selling the van.
- What?

1164
01:17:11,902 --> 01:17:13,861
Don't sell the van.

1165
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,861
I can't afford the payments,
guys, come on.

1166
01:17:15,862 --> 01:17:17,861
- Just wait a while.
- Give me a break, please.

- Pick up, pick up, pick up.
- Hello.

1172
01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:06,541
Norah, turn on the TV, channel 65.

1173
01:18:16,783 --> 01:18:20,062
I probably shouldn't,
but what have you got for sweets?

1174
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:22,542
Oh, I recommend the pecan pie.

1175
01:18:22,543 --> 01:18:26,102
All right.

1176
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:34,421
One pecan pie coming up.

1177
01:19:33,263 --> 01:19:35,862
Hello.

1178
01:19:43,344 --> 01:19:45,943
Mom?

1179
01:19:50,104 --> 01:19:53,022
Today was Oscar's eighth birthday.

1180
01:19:53,704 --> 01:19:57,703
And we did a big thing for him
at Hinkle's.

1181
01:19:58,144 --> 01:20:01,383
And Winston came.

1182
01:20:01,384 --> 01:20:05,263
After dinner Norah and Oscar
played centipede

1183
01:20:05,264 --> 01:20:08,903
and put ASS as their initials

1184
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:12,223
and got in big trouble by the manager.

1185
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,184
I don't know

1186
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:22,223
if you're in heaven or not,

1187
01:20:22,224 --> 01:20:25,143
but I know that you're not here.

1188
01:20:25,944 --> 01:20:28,184
And that is too bad for you,

1189
01:20:28,185 --> 01:20:31,063
because you really missed out.

1190
01:20:32,944 --> 01:20:36,063
You've missed out
on some really great stuff.

1191
01:20:47,505 --> 01:20:50,503
I hope you can hear me.

1192
01:21:29,105 --> 01:21:30,904
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

1193
01:21:30,905 --> 01:21:33,504
I gotta talk to you.

1194
01:21:33,505 --> 01:21:34,584
Okay.

1195
01:21:34,585 --> 01:21:36,905
I have to move in
with you and Oscar for a while.

1196
01:21:36,906 --> 01:21:38,784
- Why?
- Just temporarily,

1197
01:21:38,785 --> 01:21:40,185
just until I get my own place.

1198
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:42,704
You lost the house.

1199
01:21:42,705 --> 01:21:45,144
- No.
- Dad, how could you lose the house?

1200
01:21:45,145 --> 01:21:47,104
I didn't lose the house.
I sold the house.

1201
01:21:47,105 --> 01:21:49,659
I had a very good business opportunity
and I took it.

1202
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:51,585
I hope it's not shrimp.

1203
01:21:51,586 --> 01:21:54,104
No, it's not. It's nothing fly-by-night.
I have a partner.

1204
01:21:54,105 --> 01:21:56,144
I have a really good partner
who knows the ropes

1205
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:59,064
and I'm gonna be working
under them.

1206
01:22:03,506 --> 01:22:06,104
Dad.

1207
01:22:13,746 --> 01:22:16,304
"Since 1963"?

1208
01:22:16,305 --> 01:22:18,705
Yeah, it gives us a sense of stability.
People like that.

1209
01:22:18,706 --> 01:22:20,465
But it's a lie.

1210
01:22:20,466 --> 01:22:23,305
It's a business lie.
It's different from a life lie.

1211
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:25,624
Okay.

1212
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:28,025
I can live with that.

1213
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,905
You'll be the boss.

1214
01:22:29,906 --> 01:22:31,865
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1215
01:22:35,906 --> 01:22:38,504
