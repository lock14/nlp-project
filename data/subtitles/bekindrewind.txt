1
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,931
<i>Everyone thinks Harlem
was the capital of jazz in the 1930s.</i>

2
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:40,634
<i>That all of New York flooded uptown
at night to party till dawn.</i>

3
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:44,743
<i>Nice story, but unfortunately,
it's just not true.</i>

4
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:49,041
<i>It was all happening in the little town
of Passaic, New Jersey.</i>

5
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,748
<i>Passaic was the capital of jazz
in the '20s and '30s...</i>

6
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,353
<i>... because of its own native son...</i>

7
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:57,216
<i>... Thomas "Fats" Waller...</i>

8
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,052
<i>... one of the greatest entertainers
of all time.</i>

9
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,694
<i>Chapter 1, the birth of Fats Waller.</i>

10
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:07,162
<i>It all began right here,
a hundred years ago...</i>

11
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,801
<i>... in Passaic, New Jersey.</i>

12
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,732
<i>Right here, on this block.</i>

13
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:14,031
<i>It was a different neighborhood then,
but look here...</i>

14
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,868
<i>... he was born at 261 Main Street.</i>

15
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,875
<i>When he was young, he used to follow
his father around the streets...</i>

16
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,309
<i>... because his father
was a street minister.</i>

17
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:25,247
<i>He started playing piano, as I understand,
out in the streets here in Passaic...</i>

18
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,442
<i>... on a harmonium.</i>

19
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,077
<i>Poor boy put on pounds
faster than the price of aluminum.</i>

20
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,419
<i>One-forty-seven.</i>

21
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,084
<i>Thomas, you're gonna break
Dr. Benton 's scale.</i>

22
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,752
<i>You're getting worse.</i>

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,457
<i>Maybe that's why he would have to play
a very huge instrument.</i>

24
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,296
<i>So he would spend nights here,
at the great organ.</i>

25
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,064
<i>Fats used the church
as his training ground.</i>

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,142
<i>And soon, all of Passaic
would know his name.</i>

27
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,676
<i>Fats lived his life all in excess.</i>

28
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:58,442
<i>Loads of music, loads of food
and loads of women.</i>

29
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,351
<i>Who would expect a simple influenza virus
would get him in his bed?</i>

30
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,252
<i>A sleeping-train bed, though.</i>

31
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:10,226
<i>But still, the train had been stopped
in the freezing cold winter...</i>

32
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,990
<i>... in the train station in Kansas City.</i>

33
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,329
<i>Fats, are you okay? Fats? You okay?</i>

34
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,529
<i>Is there a doctor on the train?</i>

35
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,246
<i>Fats was the star
that made the whole town shine.</i>

36
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,993
Hey, Jerry, hand me Number 9.

37
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,994
<i>I will give you</i>

38
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,226
<i>- Okay. All right.
- Number 9</i>

39
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,293
<i>Handing you number</i>

40
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,406
<i>- Would you shut up?
- Number 9</i>

41
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,803
Could you just paint
and be quiet, please?

42
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,467
Knock it off.

43
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,805
It's terrible.

44
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,186
- What the duck, Jerry?
- What?

45
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,657
I asked you to give me Number 9,
the nose.

46
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,022
Yeah, that's what I did.

47
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:20,131
No, you didn't. This is Number 6.
This is the eye.

48
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,564
All right, well, how am I supposed to tell
the difference between a six and a nine?

49
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,261
Because we did both the eyes already,
you doofus.

50
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,463
<i>Come on, get organized.</i>

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,904
I told you, put the finished ones
in a separate pile.

52
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,543
Look, what's the difference, man?

53
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,703
A nostril and an upside-down eye
are the same anyway. It looks fine.

54
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,783
Oh, is that supposed to be funny?
Are you trying to say Fats had big nostrils?

55
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:41,476
- Jerry.
- Hi, officer, how's it going?

56
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,817
Look what happened. Last night,
some hoodlums came and did...

57
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,925
- Oh, really?
...all this stuff here, this...

58
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,584
- Here we go again.
- It's disgusting.

59
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,697
- I hate graffiti.
- Yeah, they even left the ladder.

60
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,231
That's, like, evidence.
We should confiscate it.

61
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,767
- Catch them.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

62
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,768
You're getting on my nerves.

63
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,136
You keep this up,
you'll be spending the night in jail.

64
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,300
- Okay.
- Moron.

65
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,673
If... If they come back for the ladder,
we'll catch them.

66
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,749
Hey, fellas, is that supposed to be
Biggie Smalls or something?

67
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,944
No, man, that's that dead old blues guy,
Louis Armstrong.

68
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,454
No, my ignorant little buddies,
this is Fats Waller.

69
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:20,524
<i>- Really?
- Famous jazz musician.</i>

70
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:24,151
He was born in my building
about a hundred years ago.

71
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,628
<i>- Ice cream, anyone?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

72
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,135
That's what I'm talking about.

73
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,806
Mr. Fletcher, you know,
really, seriously...

74
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,501
...if you don't like the painting,
you can... You can tell me.

75
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,581
I know that there's something wrong
with the nose, I don't know if you noticed.

76
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,279
What about the authorities, Mike?

77
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,182
The city already has issues
with the building as it is.

78
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,789
Mr. Fletcher, you don't have
to worry about the police.

79
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,927
- I worked my magic on them.
- Yeah, he did confuse them.

80
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,085
Okay, they think some gangsters did it.

81
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,288
- And you confused them?
- Yeah, with my finesse.

82
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,491
Yeah, I feel great. You sure
this is gonna bring us more customers?

83
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:05,865
I hope so. I mean, anyway, don't you think
it's time the people around here...

84
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:09,439
...started to learn a bit little about, you
know, the history of their neighborhood?

85
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,009
I mean, people don't even know
who Fats is.

86
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,874
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Hey. Hey. That's not true.

87
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,846
- We know who Fats Waller is.
- Is that right?

88
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,281
<i>Bet you can't sing a jazz song.</i>

89
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,354
- Oh, challenge.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

90
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,250
<i>That's not jazz.</i>

91
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:27,483
<i>Fuzzy, oh, oh</i>

92
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,619
<i>Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear
Fuzzy jazzy had no hair</i>

93
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:34,129
<i>Fuzzy wuzzy wasn 't fuzzy, was he?</i>

94
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,895
<i>Yes, he was, he was Fuzzy
Had a fuzzy face</i>

95
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,370
<i>Check this out and let me say
One thing to you</i>

96
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,009
<i>Watch me play my fuzzy bass</i>

97
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,339
Standup bass.

98
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,051
I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher.

99
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,745
It's all right, Jerry. I got it.

100
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,514
Actually, you gotta go back to work.

101
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,023
Duty calls. You gotta
go back to the microwave.

102
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:03,093
I think I saw one of your creations
just roll by.

103
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,355
- Turn the microwave on high.
- You think it's a joke?

104
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,056
Let me tell you, you're gonna
be responsible for my brain tumor.

105
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,429
- All of you guys are.
- Where the hell is Jerry?

106
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,831
Man, what's her problem?

107
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,336
She said she wanted a sporty car,
now she's freaking out.

108
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,599
You did that?

109
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:22,106
- I don't want this.
- Don't forget your salad bowl.

110
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,476
I told you she wouldn't be
into them big pipes.

111
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,379
Polish or not, she's still a girl.

112
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,918
Come on, Wilson.
She couldn't get the doors open.

113
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,522
Well, she could have went through
the window.

114
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,386
These damn helmets.

115
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,188
I don't think they're helping
with the microwaves at all.

116
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,694
Oh, you'll thank me.

117
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:41,799
- All right, I'll see you in the morning.
- All right, thanks.

118
00:06:57,783 --> 00:07:00,217
Good night, Mike.
Don't forget to turn out the lights.

119
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,251
Good night, Mr. Fletcher.

120
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,799
<i>A rent party was the place to be
in the '20s and '30s.</i>

121
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:20,996
They were jumping.

122
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,232
If you didn't have enough money
to cover your rent...

123
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,607
...you'd invite a few musicians,
charge for drinks, and you'd get it on.

124
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,248
Everybody would throw
just a little bit in the pot.

125
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,281
<i>A dollar, whatever they could spare.</i>

126
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,885
Jerry doesn't believe you've ever been
to a rent party, Mr. Fletcher.

127
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,079
What are you talking about?
I never said that.

128
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,587
Oh, man, I used to go to all of them.

129
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,919
That's where I'd meet
all the girls on Saturday night.

130
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,653
I can't imagine you with a girl,
Mr. Fletcher.

131
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,957
Oh, nice, that's great. That's perfect.

132
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,566
Yeah, what about you, Jerry?

133
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,261
I don't see much action
coming out of your trailer at night.

134
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,669
When I was your age,
my balls were flapping so hard...

135
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,605
... I had to scrape them off the ground
and beg them to come home with me.

136
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,178
- Come on, balls.
- Yeah, come on.

137
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,406
Come on. That's hilarious.

138
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:04,606
What about you, Mike?

139
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,718
When was the last time you heard
some action coming out of his room?

140
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,376
Why are you all worried about me for?

141
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,249
I heard some action sometime.

142
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:13,823
Now, it's more like a trumpet solo.

143
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,953
Trumpet solo.

144
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,063
Could you close your mouth
when you chew? Thanks.

145
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,960
How come you never got married,
Mr. Fletcher?

146
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,796
Well, the common story is...

147
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,201
...the girl that you was gonna ask,
you waited too long to ask...

148
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,706
...and she went on
and married somebody else.

149
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:33,970
And then you can't find anybody
that compared to her.

150
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:37,047
So, what happens? You get old.

151
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,117
Obviously we're looking
at a real improvement in quality of life.

152
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,263
These brand-new condominiums
are gonna bring us...

153
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,455
...the fresh blood
that we need for our community...

154
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:56,499
...and transform this slum forever.

155
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,002
<i>"Slum"? Hey, this is not a slum.</i>

156
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:04,199
Hey, sure, the place needs a few repairs,
but I'm taking care of it.

157
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:06,503
Look, look,
business is about to pick up.

158
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,907
I can feel it.

159
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,243
I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher,
but the building is condemned.

160
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:15,183
It violates structural,
fire and plumbing standards.

161
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,118
I don't see wheelchair access.

162
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,053
Your video store is a tenement.

163
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,854
You have 60 days from this notice
of demolition...

164
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,998
...to bring it up to code,
otherwise we will have to demolish it.

165
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,157
- But we will relocate you...
- Yes.

166
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,236
...to a property
of proportionate fair-market value.

167
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:33,962
Projects aren't so bad, you know.

168
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,039
Move to the projects?

169
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,967
How am I gonna tell Mike?

170
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:44,241
Look, I just wanna improve the life
of the people of Passaic, that's all.

171
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,847
You know, you don't have to pay me
this month, Mr. Fletcher. I'm okay.

172
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:54,459
Don't worry about the money, Mike.
I'll pay you soon.

173
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,360
I n fact, l... I need for you
to take over for me.

174
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,590
- You're retiring?
- Oh, no, no, no.

175
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,531
This year's the 60th anniversary
of Fats' death.

176
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:08,161
<i>And there's a ceremony
that's being organized in commemoration.</i>

177
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,207
We gonna all get together
in that abandoned train where he died...

178
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,470
...and we're gonna play his records
until morning.

179
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,443
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

180
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,411
I wanna come. Can I come with you?

181
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,675
No.

182
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,785
I just told you,
I need you to take over for me.

183
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,912
Oh, right, right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Okay.

184
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,320
You want me to just run the shop
while you're gone?

185
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,858
You think I could do that?

186
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,757
You tell me.

187
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,922
I'm not gonna let you down,
Mr. Fletcher.

188
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,127
Good, just don't set the place on fire.

189
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,294
Oh, no. Service, quality, safety,
you can count on that.

190
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,336
Excellent.

191
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,634
Here's something really important:

192
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,901
You must never...

193
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,045
Slam the door, because
the building will collapse.

194
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:51,205
No, Mike. I mean, yes,
but that's not what I wanted to say.

195
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:54,079
- You must never...
- Use the VCR to rewind the tapes...

196
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,619
No. Why do you always
have to finish my sentences?

197
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,950
- Okay, just listen.
- Okay. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

198
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:01,957
Okay, you must... Damn it.

199
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,995
Now I forgot what I had to say.

200
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,564
- But it's very...
- Lock the door.

201
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,262
- Mr. Fletcher, have a good trip.
- I'll have a good trip.

202
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,835
Take some pictures and call me.

203
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,528
Oh, yes, yes. l... I remember.

204
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:15,996
See, you wanted to finish my sentence.

205
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,633
- I lost my focus. I can't...
- No, no. I was listening. I was listening.

206
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,906
Hey, Mike. Mike. Keep Jerry...

207
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,346
I can't hear you.

208
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,910
Keep Jerry out. Out, out.

209
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,718
What? I don't know what that means.

210
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:35,485
<i>"Peek your edge too.
Peek your edge..."</i>

211
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:40,665
<i>"Tuo. Too. Peek your edge too."</i>

212
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,664
That's what it is.

213
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:46,037
I just found out something sad today.

214
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,531
Mr. Fletcher can't spell.

215
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,943
Maybe his parents
couldn't afford school.

216
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,808
Did he have parents?

217
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,943
- Yeah.
- I nteresting.

218
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,450
Don't mention this to anybody.

219
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,021
- Just keep this between us. Don't...
- Of course not, that would be racist.

220
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,455
Peek your... Pick.

221
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,117
Your age. Pick your age.

222
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:12,319
He's talking gibberish.

223
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,126
It's nonsense, but it's not his fault.

224
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,331
The power plant's controlling us.
I know it.

225
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,439
- Through microwaves.
- Mm-hm.

226
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,371
They're using it to make us do things.

227
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,738
To buy things, to accept things.

228
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,278
<i>And who...? Who...? Who are they?
Who are "they"?</i>

229
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,281
The government, the FBI, of course.

230
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,045
- And I say no more.
- Right.

231
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,347
I'm gonna sabotage
the power plant tonight...

232
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,888
...and you're gonna help me.

233
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,618
Look, I got a map.
Completely worked out.

234
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,921
We short-circuit this
with whatever that thing is.

235
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,961
And that blows up the transformer.

236
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:47,792
All we gotta do is climb the fence...

237
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:51,800
...and throw this sweet grappling hook
right into the transformer. Boom.

238
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,566
You know what I mean?

239
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,331
Yeah.

240
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:57,907
This, my friend, is your camouflage.

241
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,374
Camouflage.

242
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,569
Bones.

243
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,111
We need that electricity.

244
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,444
You know, we got the machines, we...
And nobody rewinds the tapes.

245
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,551
- This is more important than that.
- You gotta rewind the tapes.

246
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,311
That's the lamest excuse
I've ever heard.

247
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,252
It's totally non-sequitury,
what you're saying to me.

248
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,255
- It's a lame excuse?
- Yeah, it's lame.

249
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,621
Really? And the power plant
is controlling us?

250
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,422
That's not nonsense?
That's not paranoia?

251
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,690
<i>Okay, it sounds crazy,
and you know why?</i>

252
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,266
- Because it's affecting my brain too.
- Mm-hm.

253
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,459
<i>It's paranizing it.</i>

254
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:27,571
Mr. Fletcher left me
in charge of the store.

255
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:30,537
Me. He trusted me with the store.
Do you know what that means?

256
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,678
No, actually I don't.
Maybe you could explain it to me.

257
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,438
- It means that I'm not doing this.
- What?

258
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,911
- I'm not doing this with you.
- Okay.

259
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,743
So you'll just do anything
Mr. Fletcher says...

260
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:40,851
...even though, by the way,
he's not your real father.

261
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,850
- So... So what?
- And he's completely illiterate.

262
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:44,318
- He's not...
- But you won't do anything for me...

263
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,219
...your best friend,
who has a melting brain.

264
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:49,827
Can l...? Can l...? Can I help you
make a selection? Because if not...

265
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,123
... I'm gonna have to ask you
to make space for the other customers.

266
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,725
<i>Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
it was rush hour.</i>

267
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,300
I won't bother you anymore.

268
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,495
You know, it does get busy unexpectedly.

269
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,105
And you know, he's not illiterate.

270
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,072
First of all, because if he was illiterate,
smart guy...

271
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,768
... he wouldn't be able to write:

272
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,776
<i>"Peek your edge too."</i>

273
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:12,110
Which is... It's probably Buddhist
or something.

274
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,081
It's like... Like a chant.

275
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,687
<i>"Peek your... Pick your edge too."</i>

276
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,123
<i>- Smart guy.
- I'm not saying he's illiterate.</i>

277
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,454
I mean, he could just use some
night-schooling to perfect his spelling.

278
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,118
Just go.

279
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,194
Slow. Slower.

280
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,069
You all right?

281
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,673
Come on over. It's easy.

282
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,111
<i>Freeze.</i>

283
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,881
They always come at night
and bother me.

284
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:55,356
- Oh, come on, it's my turn tonight.
- No way. This is my baby.

285
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,757
Department of Homeland Security.

286
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,329
Wake up.

287
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,897
Be invisible.

288
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,226
Shh, did you hear something?

289
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,993
Yeah.

290
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:09,271
There's that ladder again.

291
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,942
What do you think?

292
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:15,944
I don't know, some kind of ladder gang
or something?

293
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:17,843
Oh, the ladder gang.

294
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:20,382
Let's go get some ice cream.

295
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,130
<i>- "Peek your edge too."
- What's so funny?</i>

296
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:34,526
<i>"Keep Jerry out."</i>

297
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,431
<i>- Who cares about that right now?
- He's not illiterate. "Keep Jerry out."</i>

298
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,936
- He's not illiterate.
- Who cares? Get over...

299
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,097
- What are you doing?
- I can't be here for this.

300
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,072
What are you doing? Mike, no. Mike.

301
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,644
- Mike, put that ladder back.
- I can't let you in the store.

302
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,281
- Mike, you're coming over the thing.
- Mr. Fletcher trusted me.

303
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,940
Mr. Fletcher's not gonna yell at you,
he's way too laid back.

304
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,518
I know he's not gonna yell at me.
That's part of the problem.

305
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,882
He's very good to me. I can't
let him down. I can't disappoint him.

306
00:15:58,056 --> 00:15:59,080
Listen, you don't need me.

307
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,089
- You're almost there.
- I'll never speak to you.

308
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,693
I will never speak to you again.

309
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,261
Mike! Mike!

310
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,327
Traitor.

311
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,658
I'll do it alone, baby.

312
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,294
Solo mission.

313
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,302
Solo sabotage.

314
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:25,382
Mike! Come back!

315
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:44,932
No, Jerry, no.

316
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:47,697
No. No. You have to go.

317
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,235
<i>You see the signs? "Keep Jerry out."</i>

318
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,809
This is in, that's out.

319
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:57,472
Go home, take a shower, lie down.

320
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:14,564
Oh, come on.

321
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,298
Get out of the street.
Get out of the street.

322
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,372
Wipe your face.
Jesus. Stand right there.

323
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,600
I'll get you some water.

324
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:27,534
Don't move, just wait a minute.

325
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:40,016
Oh, you feeling better now?

326
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:45,186
Mike, aren't you gonna ask me
how the sabotage went?

327
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,490
No, I wasn't, actually.

328
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,634
Oh, come on,
ask me how the sabotage went.

329
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:51,735
Okay, how'd the sabotage go?

330
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,428
Terrible. It was a two-man operation.

331
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,034
- It was a two-person sabotage.
- Shh.

332
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,145
Ma'am, if you need any help,
just let me know.

333
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,043
How about if I need any help?
Should I let you know?

334
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,309
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Yeah, apparently not.

335
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,043
Thanks.

336
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,490
Oh, that's not in alphabetical order.

337
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:18,629
I know that, it's the new order.
Excuse me.

338
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,560
- Do you work here? I don't think so.
- Jerry.

339
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,064
Haven't you heard
about the new West Coast Video...

340
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,863
...more efficient,
non-alphabetical order...

341
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:27,732
... Miss l-Know-Where-to-Put-the-Videos?

342
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:33,277
No, it's time for me
to educate your customers.

343
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,709
Do you put everything in your house
in alphabetical order?

344
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,349
- Like all of your food in the refrigerator?
- You know, maybe...

345
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,281
- Apples, bananas, carrots.
- She might, and that would be fine...

346
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,785
- Ding-Dongs.
...because she didn't do anything wrong.

347
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:46,515
<i>You know what I just realized?
I bet she's super-organized.</i>

348
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:49,558
She's really like:
I hate those kind of people.

349
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,628
- You are incredibly rude.
- Don't attack me, lady.

350
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,288
- You're incredibly rude, mister.
- Are you done yelling in my ear?

351
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,490
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- I'm sorry.

352
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,362
Did I put your forks
into the spoon drawer?

353
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,527
- Go home.
- Don't put the TV next to the radio.

354
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:01,194
- Why don't you just go, go, go?
- Get some rest.

355
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,000
- Lunatic!
- You're the cuckoo. Hey. Hey.

356
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,201
Don't put the shoes in the refrigerator,
because they'll get cold.

357
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,110
- Wow...
- Dumb broad.

358
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,340
- I am really, really sorry.
- Yeah.

359
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:12,676
He's a veteran, actually.

360
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,718
He's had a lot of exposure to,
you know, chemicals and stuff.

361
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:19,880
If there's anything you need, we got...
We got books, we got albums.

362
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,253
I got some refreshments
in the icebox.

363
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,519
Okay, I appreciate it.

364
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,219
You're welcome.

365
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:37,765
Fletcher...

366
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:44,872
...you'll pull through. Every time you think
it's the end, you always pull through.

367
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,245
Look here, look here, Mo.
I wish it was that easy, man.

368
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,818
But not this time.

369
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,717
I can't adapt, and that's why I'm broke.

370
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,723
Fletcher, this is America.

371
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,453
Anybody can make money.

372
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,792
But you...
No, let me show you something.

373
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,662
We made a ton of money
with this little thing.

374
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,429
- What, this is a dish-squirting brush?
- Mm-hm.

375
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,438
- And the soap goes in here?
- Yep. Yep.

376
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,769
- A great idea.
- You know, the squirting idea...

377
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,274
... has been around for years.

378
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,744
But we didn't make squat
until we added this.

379
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,076
A stainless-steel cover on the handle.

380
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,048
<i>People going crazy over it.</i>

381
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:24,711
- Man, our sales increased 800 percent.
- What?

382
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,725
And we expanded our market share
tenfold in two years.

383
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,353
You need to go visit all
of the successful renting businesses...

384
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,399
...and learn and adapt.
You said you can't adapt.

385
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,469
Adapt. Then just give the people
what they want.

386
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:43,096
- That's all you gotta do.
- Give the people what they want.

387
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,787
<i>Hello?</i>

388
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,192
<i>Hello, Miss Falewicz? It's...</i>

389
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,959
l... I know who this is, Mr. Fletcher.

390
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,865
l... I was hoping to hear from you.

391
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,371
<i>I was calling regarding the tape
of Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

392
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,031
Mike told me you still have it.

393
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:19,801
<i>Oh, do I?</i>

394
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,606
Well, I'll find it and...
And bring it by tomorrow.

395
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,806
Oh, no hurry.
I'm... I'm out of town anyway.

396
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,747
I'm doing a little work
and doing a little research.

397
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,217
<i>Oh? Well, how long will you be gone?</i>

398
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:32,549
<i>- A week at the most.
- Really.</i>

399
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,555
- Can I ask a favor?
- Yes.

400
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,593
Would you keep an eye out on Jerry
for me while I'm gone?

401
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,457
He destroys everything he touches.

402
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,232
Hi, good morning.

403
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:53,501
- It's blank.
- I'm sorry?

404
00:21:53,677 --> 00:21:56,441
Rewound this tape all over,
and it's blank.

405
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:58,241
Really? Did you check the...?

406
00:21:58,415 --> 00:22:00,144
Sure did. Checked that.

407
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:02,581
You know, sometimes
you gotta use head cleaner...

408
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:03,845
Okay. I did that, actually.

409
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:05,420
It'll eat the tapes.

410
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:07,352
I'll just pop it in, see what's going on.

411
00:22:07,524 --> 00:22:09,014
Excuse me, this video don't work.

412
00:22:09,193 --> 00:22:10,524
- Sorry?
- It don't work.

413
00:22:10,694 --> 00:22:12,321
It does... It won't play?

414
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:15,124
No, I rewound it,
I played it and everything.

415
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,028
<i>It's nothing but fuzz. Yeah, like that.</i>

416
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:20,331
Huh. Is your VCR NTSC?

417
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:21,562
No, it's brand-new.

418
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,639
Do you always blame
everything on the customer?

419
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:25,604
- No, not at all.
- Where is...?

420
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,038
Where's...? Where's Mr. Fletcher?

421
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:30,703
He's away on a...
On a memorial trip...

422
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:34,840
...so he left me in charge
as manager of the store.

423
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,418
So you know what I'm gonna do?

424
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:41,183
Both of you, free of charge, can have
any two tapes that you'd like in the shop.

425
00:22:41,358 --> 00:22:45,522
No, thanks. What I would like
is to be reimbursed my dollar.

426
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:47,186
- Okay.
- Because I've had enough.

427
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:49,924
Okay. Is there anything
that I could do to make...?

428
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,795
No, just my dollar.

429
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:53,630
I'll just... I was just...

430
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:56,599
- I'm really sorry about all this.
- Unfortunate.

431
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:58,332
Yeah, the whole thing is unfortunate.

432
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:00,636
This button... I'm really... Okay.

433
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:02,073
That one right there.

434
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:04,146
I tried... Oh, that's not it either.

435
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:05,838
You know what?
I think I have a dollar.

436
00:23:06,016 --> 00:23:07,881
- Okay, there it is.
- Good. Okay, great.

437
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:09,519
I'm really very sorry about that.

438
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:10,711
Thank you.

439
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:12,753
You don't have to mention this
to Mr. Fletcher.

440
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:14,515
- Give me my dollar.
- You can have it.

441
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:16,751
Okay, not... Not a problem.
I'm sorry about that.

442
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:19,020
- Uh-huh.
- All right, I got these two.

443
00:23:19,196 --> 00:23:21,596
Okay, that's... Okay, not a problem.

444
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:32,735
Stop.

445
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,116
No! No!

446
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:44,680
All the tapes are blank.

447
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:49,155
The movies, all of them, they're all...

448
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:52,056
They're all gone,
all the tapes are gone.

449
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:53,594
Where?

450
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,726
Mr. Fletcher's gonna flip
when he sees this.

451
00:23:58,902 --> 00:24:02,099
You know that look he has on his face.
He's gonna be so disappointed...

452
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:04,706
...that he left me with this responsibility.
Look, look, look.

453
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,706
What the duck?
All the tapes are like this.

454
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:08,742
All the tapes.
I tried every tape on this table.

455
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:11,676
Relax. It's the TV, Mike.

456
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:13,077
The TV's malfunctioning.

457
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,946
- It's not all the videotapes. Think about it.
- Well, show me what it's doing.

458
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,088
Show me how... What was that?

459
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:21,816
Maybe that's the picture coming back.
Wait, do... What was that?

460
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,851
Why is it doing that?

461
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,662
Does that happen when you do it?

462
00:24:28,832 --> 00:24:31,232
No, it hasn't done that at all... Wow.

463
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:35,601
What is that?

464
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:37,798
Why is it doing that when you do that?

465
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:39,272
What is wrong with you?

466
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:42,503
<i>You're magnetized.</i>

467
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,237
You...

468
00:24:44,414 --> 00:24:47,178
You erased these tapes.

469
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:48,409
It's you.

470
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:51,645
What happened
during the sabotage attempt, Jerry?

471
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:59,992
I didn't sabotage the power plant,
the power plant sabotaged me.

472
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:02,894
Really? The power plant
sabotaged you?

473
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:04,829
<i>- I'm gonna sabotage you.
- I'm magnetized!</i>

474
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:07,027
I'm not gonna get... Are you serious?

475
00:25:07,204 --> 00:25:09,536
Sabotage a power plant?
What are you, a superhero?

476
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:11,071
Don't do this, man.

477
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:13,368
You were right.

478
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,944
<i>I did have the Driving Miss Daisy tape
at home.</i>

479
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:17,842
Oh, good, that's really good.

480
00:25:22,252 --> 00:25:24,948
Thank you for returning the tape.

481
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:26,612
I like your ensemble.

482
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:31,083
<i>Listen, I wanna rent Ghostbusters.</i>

483
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:32,626
<i>Ghostbusters.</i>

484
00:25:33,697 --> 00:25:34,857
Is that out?

485
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:36,727
Isn't that a horror movie?

486
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,924
- Really?
- Yeah.

487
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,399
<i>- That could be interesting.
- Miss Falafelwicz...</i>

488
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:44,200
<i>- It's Falewicz.
- It's actually got a lot of nudity in it.</i>

489
00:25:44,374 --> 00:25:46,342
- So...
- Oh, you. Come on.

490
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,602
You're pulling my leg.

491
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:49,905
<i>We're right in the middle
of reorganizing.</i>

492
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,015
That's why all the tapes are there like that.
We're getting the stock together.

493
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,242
I think you should know
that Mr. Fletcher...

494
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,355
...calls me every night at 8 p.m.
just to see how I am.

495
00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:04,426
And I think he would not be pleased
to see his business go off the deep end...

496
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:08,361
...because some sort of boxing match
going on on his premises.

497
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:09,999
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I don't think so.

498
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,691
We're not boxing.

499
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:14,861
It's just... You know, it's just buddies...

500
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,269
...just, you know, horsing around.

501
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:20,171
- Yeah, well...
- It's nothing, just boys.

502
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:23,404
What I can do is that I can get that to you
first thing tomorrow morning.

503
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,138
No, I don't think so. Uh-uh.

504
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:27,579
I'm gonna come back before 7,
when you close.

505
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,878
- Oh, okay.
- And I really strongly suggest...

506
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:34,649
...that you get this place in order fast.
- Okay, well...

507
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:38,158
- Have a good day.
- Yeah.

508
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:46,124
She's a communist.
I don't like commies.

509
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:51,634
- I gotta get some rest, I still feel sick.
- Yeah?

510
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:53,207
Yeah, me too.

511
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:54,537
What time is it?

512
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:57,807
This is a message is for Mark.

513
00:26:57,981 --> 00:27:00,381
<i>I was wondering if you had a copy
of Ghostbusters?</i>

514
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,541
Hey, bro, is Pablo around?

515
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,311
I'm under a little bit of pressure here.

516
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:07,582
<i>Do you have a copy of Ghostbusters
that I could...? That I could borrow?</i>

517
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:09,692
You do? Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

518
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,819
No, no, no.
Because I don't need it on D VD.

519
00:27:13,997 --> 00:27:17,125
I need it on... I need it on VHS.

520
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:20,634
Yeah, well, you know,
they said that about laser discs too so...

521
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:22,396
Okay, take care.

522
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:24,369
Shit.

523
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:49,365
A clear image,
even in the middle of the day.

524
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,160
It's as powerful as the sun.

525
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:54,065
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry.

526
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:57,104
<i>Do you...?
Do you have Ghostbusters on VHS?</i>

527
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:59,902
There's no VHS here, buddy.

528
00:28:00,677 --> 00:28:02,668
Ho, ho, ho, Little Mikey?

529
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:05,176
What are you doing here, man?

530
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:07,749
- You know me?
- Of course I know you, Mike.

531
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:09,351
Oh, I get it.

532
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,147
Old man Fletcher sent you by here
to get a movie that he's missing.

533
00:28:12,322 --> 00:28:14,586
He's too embarrassed to get it himself.
Ain't that right?

534
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:16,385
- Now, ain't that right, Little Mikey?
- No, no.

535
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,788
- Yeah, that's right!
- No.

536
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:19,758
- Okay.
- I call it like I see it.

537
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,524
- All right, you take... You take care.
- I got you.

538
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:30,730
Tell me the truth, doc.
How long have I got left?

539
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:32,033
Ten minutes.

540
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:34,133
Ten minutes?

541
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:36,575
This should help.

542
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:13,539
<i>Miss Kobayashi had a fever of...</i>

543
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:17,050
I'm Bill Murray, you're everybody else.

544
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,415
<i>What, are you crazy?
She's never gonna buy it.</i>

545
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:24,185
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She doesn't know
what the movie's supposed to look like.

546
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:27,762
The only thing that she knows
is what's on this box.

547
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:29,626
She's never seen it before.

548
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,896
<i>If we stay 10 feet away from the camera
she's not gonna recognize us.</i>

549
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:37,063
We come up with some special effects,
we do it ourselves.

550
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,401
She's gonna be back in, like,
two hours and 45 minutes.

551
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:41,806
She's on the phone with Fletcher
every night.

552
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:43,775
The first scene is at the library.

553
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:46,541
And take that thing off, please.

554
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:48,507
Okay.

555
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:56,916
And action.

556
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:01,023
- Start over. Sorry, cut.
- What?

557
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:02,324
I looked right in the lens.

558
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:03,557
- We gotta start over.
- We can't start over.

559
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:05,701
- I looked right in the lens.
- You just have to do one good take.

560
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:07,632
All right? Don't...
Listen, what you're doing is good.

561
00:30:07,804 --> 00:30:08,862
- I am doing good, right?
- Just do the same thing.

562
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,529
- Yeah, just do the same thing.
- Am I doing great?

563
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:12,538
- You're doing great, but don't look...
- All right, you're doing good too...

564
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:15,507
...with the cinematography.
- All right, thanks. Okay, good.

565
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,805
Go check the cards.

566
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,175
Check the cards.

567
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,310
You're doing... That's good, that's right.
That's great. That's good.

568
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:25,921
- Put your head down, put your head down.
- I can't see.

569
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:28,023
Go back to the shelf.

570
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:32,686
Suspecting nothing, and ghosts.
Ghosts.

571
00:30:44,074 --> 00:30:47,703
<i>When you're walking down the street
And you see a little ghost</i>

572
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:51,314
<i>What you gonna
Do about Ghostbusters?</i>

573
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:55,383
<i>- What? What? What is that?
- That's the Ghostbusters theme song.</i>

574
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:57,954
- No.
- I'm pretty sure it is.

575
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:14,434
- About this stuff...
- We've got one right there.

576
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:16,572
Let's get a closer look.

577
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,039
Hey, have you talked to Elvis lately?

578
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:25,809
We're moving on to stage two.
We can capture her.

579
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:28,951
We have the megapixels.
You just have to stay with me, okay?

580
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,143
- Okay.
- Okay.

581
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:40,388
Excuse me.

582
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:46,563
We got her. We did it,
because we're Ghostbusters.

583
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:47,828
- All right.
- Pound it.

584
00:31:48,004 --> 00:31:50,939
I'm in the hotel reading area
for children...

585
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:53,337
...and I'm getting a lot of creepy vibes.

586
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,705
I think I did hear something.

587
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:58,279
You heard something?
Stay where you are, I'm on my way.

588
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:13,722
I got... I got slimed.

589
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:22,696
Okay, Wilson, go now. Wilson, now!

590
00:32:22,872 --> 00:32:24,396
- Wilson?
- Should I come in now?

591
00:32:24,574 --> 00:32:26,701
- Yes, for duck's sake, now, Wilson.
- I wasn't sure.

592
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:31,836
If you or any of your family
have seen ectoplasmic apparitions...

593
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:34,347
...or heard funny noises in your attic...

594
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,848
Call Ghostbusters.

595
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:38,419
We're fully staffed and ready
24 hours a day...

596
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:40,715
...to fulfill your supernatural needs.

597
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,415
- We're ready to believe you.
- We're ready to believe you.

598
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:45,652
Look at the refrigerator.

599
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:51,923
Hello, I need Ghostbusters, fast.
There's a strange alien in my refrigerator.

600
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:59,198
- Okay, go.
- Rock 'n' roll. How does it look?

601
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:01,344
<i>- Amazing, very real.
- Hey, come on. Yeah.</i>

602
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:04,105
Okay, now, the next scene
is the car screeching through the night.

603
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:05,475
- Okay.
- Well, not night...

604
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:08,015
...because we're not in the night.
We gotta just go with the day.

605
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:10,152
No, no, no. All dramatic scenes
are shot at night.

606
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,288
You got... You gotta...
You gotta shoot it at night.

607
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:15,618
- The day is fine. What are you doing?
- And then, you also have to wet the floor.

608
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:17,225
- You wet the floor.
- Would you stop?

609
00:33:17,394 --> 00:33:19,123
That's just a waste of water.
Would you stop?

610
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:21,127
Mike, I'm not gonna botch this job, man.

611
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,664
If you wanna do it in the day,
you'll find somebody else.

612
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:27,166
<i>Miss Falewicz will be back
in less than an hour. We don't have time.</i>

613
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:29,999
We just need a minimum amount
of professionalism.

614
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:32,437
I can shoot a night scene in the day,
give me the camera.

615
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:33,974
- No.
- Give me the camera.

616
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:35,543
Let me just show you how you...

617
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:40,813
You... You cannot touch the camera. You're
gonna erase everything that we've done.

618
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:44,715
<i>Mike, look on the side of the camera.
There's a button that says, "negative."</i>

619
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:47,755
See? Makes it look like nighttime
in the day. Am I right?

620
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:49,755
- Oh, there it goes.
- Thank you, you're welcome.

621
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:53,191
Your face is negative, though. Don't.

622
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:55,558
- There's something we can do about that.
- What?

623
00:33:55,732 --> 00:33:58,098
- Okay, go.
- All right.

624
00:33:59,402 --> 00:34:02,030
- Close your eyes.
- You're telling me that now?

625
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:04,298
Sorry. Good job.

626
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:10,709
Gotta run,
got a date with a Ghostbuster.

627
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:16,913
Busting makes me feel good.

628
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:21,180
Okay, Wilson.

629
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:25,525
- Ghostbusters, open the door!
- Wait, wait, do it one more time.

630
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:27,128
Ghostbusters, open the...

631
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:30,198
Are you the Gatekeeper
or the Keymaster?

632
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:33,530
Are you the Keymaster?
I want your key inside of me.

633
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:35,967
- Are you menstruating?
- That's not from the...

634
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,733
Back off, I'm the scientist here.

635
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:41,433
I'm gonna open that refrigerator door.

636
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:50,515
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

637
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:52,120
<i>We ionized it.</i>

638
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,280
It was a complete particle reversal.

639
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:56,949
Can I go now?

640
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:59,789
As the 100-foot marshmallow man
tried to kill them...

641
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:05,799
...they decided to reverse reality
by crossing their beams.

642
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:09,632
Run, everyone, run.
There's a Stay Puft Marsh...

643
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,036
Okay.

644
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,407
- Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.
- See you on the other side.

645
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:22,975
The end. Starring Bill Murray
and other actors.

- Yeah, I'm here.

650
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:39,098
By the way, it looks a load better.
Big improvement.

651
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:42,136
- Oh, yeah. We were just...
- Mr. Fletcher will be pleased.

652
00:35:42,305 --> 00:35:44,466
Yeah, we were doing...
We were doing inventory here.

A nice and tidy house.
First step to combating depression:

654
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:51,947
- To have an optimistic view of the future.
- Hey, that sounds...

655
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:54,242
You know what I do
whenever I'm feeling depressed?

656
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:56,442
- Oh, what's that?
- I clean my house.

657
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:58,849
- Oh, really?
- Honest to God, it clears the mind.

658
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:01,786
You'll see, in the morning
when the sun comes in.

659
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,688
- Uh-huh.
- Number one step for fighting depression.

660
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:08,297
<i>Here it is, Miss Falewicz, there you go.
Ghostbusters like you asked for.</i>

661
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:10,296
<i>When you're walking down the street</i>

662
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:12,367
<i>- You know what, l...
- And you see a little ghost</i>

663
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:15,299
- All right.
- I have a... I have a...

664
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:16,962
I was gonna say I have a...

665
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,608
<i>- What are you doing? I have a method.
- What you gonna do?</i>

666
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:22,643
<i>- A foolproof method for fighting depression.
- Ghostbusters</i>

667
00:36:22,812 --> 00:36:25,610
You get a notebook
and you, like, put four columns in it.

668
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:27,477
<i>- And the first column is...
- And you see a little ghost</i>

669
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,912
<i>...the effort you believe...
- What you gonna do?</i>

670
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:30,814
<i>...the dreaded task will take...
- Ghostbusters</i>

671
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:33,148
Tell me the other two tomorrow,
because I'm really...

672
00:36:33,323 --> 00:36:35,655
- Good movie you got there.
- I'm focused on those first two.

673
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:38,055
Wait a sec, 1 dollar, one tape,
one night, right?

674
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:40,355
<i>- No, Miss Falewicz, it's not a problem.
- I'm in it.</i>

675
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,430
- It's okay. That's on us today.
- Really?

676
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,623
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

677
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,827
- You're welcome. Take care.
- Enjoy the movie.

678
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,539
We should've had, like, a premiere
of that thing or something.

679
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,405
<i>- What?
- What are you talking about, "what"?</i>

680
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,638
She's not supposed to know
that we're in the movie...

681
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:00,680
<i>...because we're not in Ghostbusters.
- Yeah? Maybe I want her to know...</i>

682
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,977
<i>- Maybe I am in Ghostbusters.
- Why is it...?</i>

683
00:37:03,152 --> 00:37:05,586
- Because I'm proud of my work.
- Oh, you're...

684
00:37:05,755 --> 00:37:08,588
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Mike, you have zero ambition.</i>

685
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:10,885
- What's...?
- That's your problem.

686
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,427
You're gonna be stuck in this dump
for the rest of your life.

687
00:37:14,597 --> 00:37:16,258
Good night.

688
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:20,096
Wh...? What? What? What's a dump?

689
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,162
What's a dump?
My... My shop is a dump?

690
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:23,532
You live in a junkyard.

691
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:27,164
Not just the store,
the whole city is a swamp.

692
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:31,302
- It's a swamp now?
- Yeah, a dump swamp.

693
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:34,480
When you get stuck here,
you're stuck for life.

694
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:39,520
Come on, Mike, what is so great
about this town? Huh?

695
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:43,119
- The people.
- The people?

696
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:46,262
You're gonna make me cry.
The people.

697
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:49,865
The only reason there's anybody here
is because they have nowhere to go.

698
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:53,662
<i>Why don't you...? Why don't you
go somewhere, Mr. "Junkman"?</i>

699
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:57,033
We got a customer. We got a customer.

700
00:37:57,206 --> 00:37:59,697
- Mr... Mr. Jack.
- Hi, how you doing?

701
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:02,071
Yeah, actually, we're closed.

702
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:05,305
- I'm actually open later...
- It'll just take a moment, guys.

703
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:07,381
<i>- Rush Hour 2, that's all.
- Excellent choice.</i>

704
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,815
<i>It's out. But you come back tomorrow,
and I can... I can get you Ghostbusters.</i>

705
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:13,512
<i>Seen it. Jaws?</i>

706
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,386
- Whoa, what the duck?
- Whoa, what was that?

707
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:22,688
<i>How about Towering Inferno?</i>

708
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:24,628
- I saw it.
- Mr. Jack...

709
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,325
...if you just come back tomorrow.

710
00:38:26,502 --> 00:38:29,198
l... I'll take care of all of that tomorrow,
okay, Mr. Jack?

711
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:32,569
<i>I can't believe you don't have Rush Hour 2.
I'm gonna go to West Coast Video.</i>

712
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:34,767
No, you... No, you're not.
Dude, you'd better...

713
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:37,811
You don't do that, you...
Have some morals.

714
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:41,246
<i>Just wait till tomorrow.
I'll have Rush Hour 2 tomorrow.</i>

715
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:42,816
Good!

716
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:55,463
Lee, I'm coming.

717
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,801
I'm taking the stairs.

718
00:39:01,404 --> 00:39:02,666
Lee.

719
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:03,897
Lee.

720
00:39:04,073 --> 00:39:05,097
Cut, that was great.

721
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:21,850
Lee!

722
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:25,153
- Over here.
- Lee, what you doing down there, man?

723
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:27,159
Carter, behind you.
Behind you, look out.

724
00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:35,969
Lee, this Chinese bamboo
ain't gonna hold.

725
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:40,940
Don't worry, Carter,
Chinese bamboo, very strong.

726
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:52,480
This Chinese bamboo ain't strong.
I can't believe you got me out here.

727
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:56,523
Forget about the bamboo.
We gotta go solve a crime.

728
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:01,553
Go in for the kiss now, Jerry.
Go in for the kiss.

729
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:04,097
Go in for the kiss now.
Go now, kiss him now.

730
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:05,666
Hold on.

731
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:08,895
Why do I have to kiss Wilson?

732
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:11,097
- She's the bad guy, right?
- Right.

733
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:13,936
She's got the detonator...
He's got the detonator in his hand.

734
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,737
You have the bomb in your mouth.

735
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:18,176
You have to press it against her
to keep her from blowing your head off.

736
00:40:18,347 --> 00:40:20,042
- I'm not kissing Wilson.
- It's not a kiss!

737
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:23,117
I don't wanna kiss Wilson.

738
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:27,381
We've been working with him all day.
We can't replace him.

739
00:40:27,557 --> 00:40:28,922
- Could I just say something?
- What?

740
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:30,753
I quit.

741
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:34,260
- Amateurs. I hate this movie.
- Wilson...

742
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,091
Thanks, good work today.

743
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:37,991
Mike.

744
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:40,362
Mike, Mike. Listen to me.

745
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:43,232
Maybe you can understand that
I don't want the whole neighborhood...

746
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:47,502
...to think I'm having a homosexual,
interracial relationship with my mechanic.

747
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:48,905
Oh. Okay.

748
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:52,343
- So the interracial is the issue.
- Okay, forget about the interracial thing...

749
00:40:52,515 --> 00:40:57,111
...but kissing my mechanic is disturbing
and inappropriate.

750
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:59,584
He could sue me
for sexual harassment.

751
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:01,417
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, come on.

752
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:04,617
Mike, Mike, Mike. I got a better idea.

753
00:41:05,094 --> 00:41:06,721
Follow me.

754
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,695
Right, yeah,
There's a stain on this sweater.

755
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:12,596
- Okay. Okay.
- You see what I'm talking about?

756
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:14,566
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.

757
00:41:14,737 --> 00:41:18,605
We're moviemakers and we're making
a movie around the corner.

758
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:21,107
And we have a kissing scene,
and we need an actress...

759
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:23,108
<i>...and you are amazing.</i>

760
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:26,112
I'm sorry, I can't leave the store.

761
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:28,648
I have work to do, but my sister can.

762
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:30,786
- Alma.
- What?

763
00:41:30,953 --> 00:41:31,977
Come here.

764
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:36,118
These guys are making a film
around the corner. They need a girl.

765
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,782
What kind of film are you making?

766
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,895
Actually it's like comedy,
action, adventure.

767
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:43,725
- Like, the types of movies, you know...
- I don't think you understand...

768
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,265
- Like what kind?
...what we're offering you, though.

769
00:41:45,434 --> 00:41:48,733
- We want you to be a movie star.
- I told you I have to stay here.

770
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:51,635
I can't leave, but she should go,
she's a really good actress.

771
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:54,641
- I was in the school play.
- She was a fridge.

772
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:56,836
- A refrigerator?
- Yeah.

773
00:41:57,013 --> 00:41:59,208
So check it out.
Okay, so I'm standing in the kitchen...

774
00:41:59,382 --> 00:42:00,474
...and this is my door.

775
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,142
And then I had, like, to close my eye
like this, and I go like that.

776
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,379
- Okay, we're gonna take a quick meeting.
- That was the light.

777
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:07,750
- A quick producers' meeting.
- It's the light.

778
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:09,516
- You got it.
- She's horrible.

779
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:11,990
- What's the matter? She's...
- She's the worst actress I've ever seen.

780
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:13,492
Listen to me, I know a woman...

781
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:15,893
...who works across the street
at the diner, she's per...

782
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:19,330
Are you gonna kiss her or Wilson?
Because that's what it is at this point.

783
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:21,561
- You gonna kiss her?
- I hate you right now.

784
00:42:21,737 --> 00:42:23,534
Okay, we did it.

785
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,805
- Guess what, we just had a meeting.
- Yeah?

786
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:27,772
- You got the part.
- I got the part?

787
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:29,878
- Oh, yeah.
- So we should... We should go now...

788
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:31,104
...because we're actually...

789
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,304
- We're shooting right now.
- Thank you so much.

790
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,915
It's gonna be fun.
We're gonna makes some movies.

791
00:42:35,084 --> 00:42:36,642
I'm sorry, can...? Can...? Can...?

792
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:37,843
- Is this yours?
- Yes, it is.

793
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,318
- Can we use this just really quickly?
- No, no, no.

794
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:43,356
- She just dropped this off to be cleaned.
- Just really, really quickly.

795
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:44,993
- It'll be all right.
- You don't have to do that.

796
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:47,391
We'll bring it back.
We'll make sure it's in fine condition.

797
00:42:47,563 --> 00:42:48,655
- What's your name?
- Ann.

798
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:50,025
Ann. Miss Ann. Thank you so much.

799
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:51,928
We gotta make sure
she gets a wardrobe credit.

800
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:54,501
She will get a credit for sure,
and then some.

801
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,762
- I'm gonna be thinking about...
- Thank you.

802
00:42:55,938 --> 00:42:57,565
...parts for you in the future
of our films.

803
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,105
Not you, however. You blew it.

804
00:42:59,275 --> 00:43:00,867
I wanted to make you Marilyn Monroe.

805
00:43:01,043 --> 00:43:02,738
- Now you're just gonna be the cleaner.
- Okay, let's go. Thank you.

806
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:06,609
- Thank you for letting us use your sister.
- Alma, keep your tongue in your mouth.

807
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:08,511
<i>- We're gonna go down here.
- It's Rush Hour 2...</i>

808
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:10,276
...and you're gonna play the girl.

809
00:43:10,453 --> 00:43:12,216
Action, guys.

810
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:15,955
What...?

811
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:17,758
- Oh, damn. Damn.
- What was that?

812
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:20,358
Hold still.

813
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:22,191
- Stop.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

814
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:26,392
He got exposed to radioactive waves.

815
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:28,196
Are you radioactive?

816
00:43:28,371 --> 00:43:30,362
Is it contagious?
Am I gonna be radioactive now?

817
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:34,373
<i>Not radioactive! Magnetized!</i>

818
00:43:34,543 --> 00:43:35,567
Give me my bottle.

819
00:43:36,812 --> 00:43:40,304
I'm sorry, we didn't have a chance to...
It's not contagious.

820
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,511
I'm just gonna check...
Sorry. You're fine.

821
00:43:43,686 --> 00:43:45,415
- This came out pretty good.
- I'm fine?

822
00:43:45,588 --> 00:43:47,351
<i>- Not magnetized.
- Uh-huh, yeah. Okay, good.</i>

823
00:43:47,523 --> 00:43:50,048
<i>- Not magnetized.
- What about your friend?</i>

824
00:43:50,226 --> 00:43:51,318
Huh?

825
00:43:52,495 --> 00:43:54,929
Hey, Jerry. I'm really sorry
about hurting your feelings.

826
00:43:55,097 --> 00:43:57,657
I just, like... I got really scared
about the radioactive stuff.

827
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:00,428
Yeah, I know.
It's my fault, I should've warned you.

828
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:02,002
Yeah.

829
00:44:05,274 --> 00:44:06,468
Is that you?

830
00:44:07,343 --> 00:44:09,709
- I took the whole bottle.
- Why would you do that, Jerry?

831
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:12,473
I just wanted to go to sleep.
Am I gonna die?

832
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:16,550
Yeah, it's aspirin, not sleeping pills,
you dummy. Why be a dummy?

833
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:19,153
You are not going to die, okay?

834
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:21,187
- lf you do what I say, okay?
- What's happening?

835
00:44:21,357 --> 00:44:22,756
I need you to go to the bathroom...

836
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:24,825
...get me a bucket full of salt and water,
right now.

837
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:27,724
- Salt, salt.
- Okay?

838
00:44:27,897 --> 00:44:29,489
Just sit down, relax.

839
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,358
- I'm gonna die.
- No, you're not gonna die, I promise.

840
00:44:32,535 --> 00:44:34,264
- I've done it before.
- I have a good future.

841
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:37,736
Here, here. Drink it, drink it.

842
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:41,766
Good.

843
00:44:42,845 --> 00:44:45,575
- You okay?
- That was good.

844
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:48,842
Hey, look at me, I'm doing good.

845
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:50,280
Oh, that's me.

846
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:55,449
Oh, not again.

847
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:59,193
Why does he have to puke
outside of the shop every time?

848
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,296
Oh, good, now he's gonna
puke out all the bad stuff.

849
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:03,932
- You see?
- But in front of the shop?

850
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:06,695
Hi. Sorry.

851
00:45:08,638 --> 00:45:10,230
Wait, what's he doing now?

852
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:16,240
Oh, nice, nice. Pee.

853
00:45:16,412 --> 00:45:18,403
- You guys are so weird.
- It all came out in my pee.

854
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:19,946
Yeah.

855
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,481
Is his pee making it do that?

856
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:26,352
Thank God for my bladder.

857
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:28,615
Okay, good. Would you just finish
and come inside?

858
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:31,089
Alma, I owe you one.

859
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,888
Let's test it out. Let's test it out.

860
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,258
Let's test it out.
Is it warping the image still?

861
00:45:36,432 --> 00:45:38,297
- No. No.
- No? No?

862
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:41,129
<i>- It worked. It's working.
- I'm demagnetized, you're a genius.</i>

863
00:45:41,304 --> 00:45:42,635
- Thanks to me.
- You saved my life.

864
00:45:42,805 --> 00:45:45,467
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mr. Jack.

865
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:47,632
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, nothing.

866
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,301
We were just closing up, actually.

867
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:52,947
Yeah, so there it is.

868
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:56,175
I have to pay in mostly pennies.
That's okay?

869
00:45:56,352 --> 00:45:58,013
- Fine. That's... That's okay.
- Thank you.

870
00:45:58,187 --> 00:45:59,347
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the movie.

871
00:45:59,522 --> 00:46:00,955
Your pennies are always good here.

872
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:02,988
I'm gonna enjoy it, thank you.

873
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,217
Good night.

874
00:46:04,393 --> 00:46:06,554
- Enjoy the movie?
- Yeah, enjoy the movie.

875
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:08,321
We worked hard on it.
It's gonna be good.

876
00:46:08,497 --> 00:46:11,398
Yo, we gotta find new tapes.
We're gonna get caught.

877
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:12,864
- We can't keep doing this.
- What are you talking about?

878
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,127
It's going fine. So far, so good.

879
00:46:14,303 --> 00:46:18,069
<i>What? When Miss Falewicz
sees "Ghostbusters"?</i>

880
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,038
- Our version is better than the original.
- She's gonna say something...

881
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,839
...to Mr. Fletcher. First of all,
our version is only 20 minutes.

882
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:27,881
Yeah, but 20 minutes,
it's all the brain can concentrate for.

883
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,211
It's the perfect duration.
It's a biological fact.

884
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:31,648
- I study this, I know.
- Yeah.

885
00:46:31,821 --> 00:46:35,086
<i>And besides, Miss Falewicz has never seen
a science-fiction movie before.</i>

886
00:46:35,257 --> 00:46:38,556
She might think all of them are 20 minutes
long. And isn't she a little kooky?

887
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:40,821
<i>She probably won't even recognize us.</i>

888
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,932
Y'all need to chill out, all right?

889
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:49,629
Craig?

890
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:52,673
- What's up, old lady?
- Yo, come on in, guys.

891
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:55,003
Yo, Craig. What's up, man?

892
00:46:59,415 --> 00:47:01,747
Dude, you gotta check this out, man.

893
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:05,409
My auntie got this
from Fats' video store.

894
00:47:05,588 --> 00:47:07,021
<i>This is Ghostbusters.</i>

895
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:08,986
- Roshambo.
- Water.

896
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:10,648
- Laser.
- Water.

897
00:47:10,826 --> 00:47:13,488
- Whoa. Uh-oh.
- Oh, no.

898
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,961
<i>Miss Falewicz gave it to her nephew.</i>

899
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:19,058
It looks like they were disappointed
with the video.

900
00:47:19,235 --> 00:47:21,100
- Come on, guys.
- Do they have guns?

901
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,569
I can clearly see you
hiding behind the counter.

902
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:29,601
We was closed,
something's wrong with these lights.

903
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:30,803
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

904
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,471
Y'all open now.

905
00:47:39,288 --> 00:47:42,052
That wasn't bad. What else y'all got?

906
00:47:42,224 --> 00:47:44,419
- The whole store.
- No. No.

907
00:47:44,593 --> 00:47:47,562
<i>We actually...
We only have Rush Hour 2.</i>

908
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,563
No, man, he said the whole store.

909
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:52,564
- Why you lie to me, man?
- I'm not lying.

910
00:47:52,735 --> 00:47:54,225
Guys, make your choice.

911
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,838
- What is wrong with you?
- It just came out.

912
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:04,307
What you got?

913
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,107
Right. Yeah, that's for...

914
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:09,513
Hey, man, hand me one of them
little mint jump off, right there.

915
00:48:09,685 --> 00:48:12,483
We'd love to rent you out
these videos today...

916
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:15,351
...but Mr. Fletcher, right, he called.

917
00:48:15,524 --> 00:48:17,458
- Oh, yeah.
- We got the new policy.

918
00:48:17,626 --> 00:48:21,027
Two videos per day, per account, so...

919
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:23,165
All right then,
let me open an account right now.

920
00:48:23,332 --> 00:48:25,027
Yeah, man. Sign away.

921
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:29,035
We're gonna need your picture I D,
your phone bill...

922
00:48:29,205 --> 00:48:31,400
...your last three rent receipts,
your grades...

923
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:33,474
...a letter from your mother
if you're a minor...

924
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:36,042
...the last three countries
you visited prior to this trip...

925
00:48:36,212 --> 00:48:38,476
...your 10 favorite films
and your blood type.

926
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:40,842
You know, you're real lucky
we don't beat up girls.

927
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:42,711
- Word.
- For real.

928
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:44,978
Except Craig's aunt.

929
00:48:45,154 --> 00:48:46,951
Shut up, stupid.

930
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:49,353
We'll be back
with all the necessary documents.

931
00:48:49,825 --> 00:48:52,293
We still have two to choose, right?

932
00:48:52,461 --> 00:48:54,895
Here you go,
you pick two of those and we'll be...

933
00:48:55,064 --> 00:48:56,463
That's my choice.

934
00:48:56,632 --> 00:48:58,259
- You guys pick the other one.
- No, no, no.

935
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:00,664
You get to pick your choice,
and we gotta fight over ours?

936
00:49:00,836 --> 00:49:02,269
- Yeah.
- What kind of democracy is that?

937
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:05,100
Man, who told you
this was a democracy?

938
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:07,037
Hey, hey, you guys, you guys.

939
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:10,542
You guys, listen. You guys!

940
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,039
<i>Life without civilization is brutal...</i>

941
00:49:15,217 --> 00:49:19,654
... nasty and short.

942
00:49:19,822 --> 00:49:21,221
If you're gonna come around here...

943
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:26,089
<i>...and spread pizza
all over the walls with gats...</i>

944
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:28,162
...you're gonna miss out
on some good movies.

945
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,230
So this is what I'm saying.

946
00:49:30,399 --> 00:49:32,492
I'm gonna put all of these videos
into this bag.

947
00:49:33,002 --> 00:49:36,631
Alma, you're gonna pick out
two of these videos at random.

948
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:39,297
<i>Totally random.
It's the only way to do it civilized.</i>

949
00:49:39,742 --> 00:49:44,202
And everyone will survive. Pick it out.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

950
00:49:45,014 --> 00:49:47,312
- Here they are.
- These are your choices.

951
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:48,950
Done.

952
00:49:49,118 --> 00:49:50,517
How the hell?

953
00:49:50,686 --> 00:49:54,315
<i>Okay, who's the baby
that picked The Lion King? Hm?</i>

954
00:49:54,723 --> 00:49:56,315
Someone did.

955
00:50:00,362 --> 00:50:01,420
- What?
- Yeah.

956
00:50:01,597 --> 00:50:04,589
But we will have them for you
at 4 p.m. tomorrow...

957
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:07,327
...as long as you give us
$20 right now.

958
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:09,801
Twenty dollars?
Yo, that's a complete rip-off.

959
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:12,907
No, no, no.
These are custom made. Sweded.

960
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:17,171
- Sweded.
- It's a very rare type of video.

961
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:19,371
- Swede? Like Sweden?
- Yeah, Sweded.

962
00:50:19,548 --> 00:50:23,484
- It's a country, not a verb.
- Exactly. That's why it's expensive.

963
00:50:23,652 --> 00:50:26,883
Because it's a faraway,
expensive country.

964
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:28,353
- It's imported.
- Sweded.

965
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:34,925
A toast. Twenty bucks in one day.
That's never happened at Be Kind Rewind.

966
00:50:35,097 --> 00:50:36,189
- That's never happened. Never.
- Never happened at all?

967
00:50:36,365 --> 00:50:38,856
<i>- Nice with the civilization theory.
- Right?</i>

968
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:40,467
- I gotta say, that was nice.
- I pulled that out.

969
00:50:40,636 --> 00:50:42,763
I do some thinking at night.

970
00:50:42,938 --> 00:50:45,498
If I can't sleep,
I'm just thinking about stuff.

971
00:50:45,674 --> 00:50:48,142
<i>- Who picked The Lion King?
- That's what I was wondering.</i>

972
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:51,575
<i>The big guy, maybe.
One of those guys picked The Lion King.</i>

973
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:52,975
It was me.

974
00:50:53,148 --> 00:50:54,775
- You snuck it in there?
- Yeah.

975
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,247
You're a badass.

976
00:50:56,418 --> 00:50:58,943
<i>See, well, Pocahontas used to be,
like, my favorite movie, right?</i>

977
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:01,351
But then I couldn't find it
when you got the bag idea...

978
00:51:01,523 --> 00:51:03,218
<i>...so I just picked Lion King instead.</i>

979
00:51:03,392 --> 00:51:08,329
It is such a good movie too.
I cry every time when the father dies.

980
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:11,591
<i>Oh, man, I love The Lion King too.
It's my favorite picture, man.</i>

981
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:13,962
My mom loved it.

982
00:51:14,136 --> 00:51:15,603
- It's awesome.
- You like it too?

983
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:17,671
- Yeah, it's awesome.
- It's deeply deep.

984
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,398
- Oh, yeah.
- Because the uncle...

985
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:22,339
...kills the nephew's father.
- His father...

986
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:24,308
...which is his brother.
- That's his brother.

987
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,007
He kills his own brother, right?
That's some heavy, Shapeskearian shit.

988
00:51:28,417 --> 00:51:29,714
What's funny?

989
00:51:29,885 --> 00:51:31,546
- Shape... Nothing.
- Well, you know...

990
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,019
<i>Does anybody have any ideas,
Lion King lady...</i>

991
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:38,785
...about how we're supposed to shoot
an animated film?

992
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:43,227
Roar! I am the king!

993
00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:46,129
Roar! Jerry, I kind of see your head.

994
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:47,496
- What?
- It doesn't look real.

995
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,638
Well, Alma, stay on the voices.

996
00:51:49,805 --> 00:51:51,534
We'll be in charge
of the bodies and motion.

997
00:51:51,707 --> 00:51:52,969
- Okay.
- I need you to say this:

998
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:56,509
<i>"I'm gonna piss on the graves
of your ancestors. "</i>

999
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:58,237
- It's important in the story, Alma.
- Don't say that.

1000
00:51:58,414 --> 00:51:59,608
Roar!

1001
00:51:59,782 --> 00:52:02,842
I'm going to piss
on the heads of your ancestors!

1002
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:04,918
No, wait. Hold on.
This is a children's movie.

1003
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:08,284
This is the sequel.
We're doing part two.

1004
00:52:14,563 --> 00:52:16,190
Less choice...

1005
00:52:16,365 --> 00:52:20,233
...more copies of the same movie.

1006
00:52:21,103 --> 00:52:24,971
<i>Simplified categorization of genre.</i>

1007
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,232
Sir?

1008
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:27,432
Hi.

1009
00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:32,342
Noticeable outfit
and big badge on employee.

1010
00:52:32,514 --> 00:52:34,414
Sir, are you sure I can't help you?

1011
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:38,519
You've been here for the last two hours,
you can't seem to make up your mind.

1012
00:52:39,588 --> 00:52:41,021
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1013
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,250
<i>Do you carry a copy
of Stormy Weather?</i>

1014
00:52:44,426 --> 00:52:46,656
- What?
- No specific...

1015
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:51,766
...knowledge required.

1016
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:53,558
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1017
00:52:53,736 --> 00:52:55,363
Okay. Very helpful.

1018
00:52:57,673 --> 00:52:58,765
- That's it.
- Shoot him, Robo.

1019
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:01,034
I'm taking you downtown.

1020
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,542
- I'm coming to get you now...
- Well, you're gonna get shot.

1021
00:53:03,712 --> 00:53:05,680
...with my gun.

1022
00:53:05,848 --> 00:53:07,440
And there's more
where that came from...

1023
00:53:07,616 --> 00:53:09,208
- No!
...for you, cop lady.

1024
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:12,813
Y'all still shooting, man?

1025
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:14,012
- Yeah, we...
- Four o' clock.

1026
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:16,987
Y'all were supposed to be done.
I've been out there for 20 minutes.

1027
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:19,457
- Don't worry. I can handle this guy.
- No, no, I got it, man.

1028
00:53:19,628 --> 00:53:21,323
- Let me show you how to do this, man.
- We almost done.

1029
00:53:21,497 --> 00:53:25,297
I will shoot you
and I know robot karate.

1030
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:26,798
I got something for you, man.

1031
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:29,130
What do you think you're...?
I'll take you to the...

1032
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:31,502
- Robo!
- Yeah.

1033
00:53:31,673 --> 00:53:34,073
- You want some? Yeah, you want some?
- No.

1034
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:36,473
- Stay back.
- I'm wounded!

1035
00:53:36,645 --> 00:53:38,237
I'm giving you
till the count of three...

1036
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:40,075
...to drop your weapon.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

1037
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:46,784
That's not funny, y'all.

1038
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:48,183
- Cut.
- Whatever, y'all.

1039
00:53:48,357 --> 00:53:51,258
- It's kind of funny.
- No, it's part of the movie.

1040
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:52,860
- That was good.
- It went really well.

1041
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:54,996
- I like your badge.
- Thanks, I made it myself.

1042
00:53:55,164 --> 00:53:58,224
Great. Just... Who are these people?

1043
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,561
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

1044
00:54:06,842 --> 00:54:07,934
Let's go before they see us.

1045
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,601
Mike! Mike! Over here!

1046
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:13,339
Lookit, okay? You're gonna smile.

1047
00:54:13,515 --> 00:54:15,710
Pretend like you know
what you're doing, okay?

1048
00:54:15,884 --> 00:54:17,613
- I'm gonna take care of the rest. Yes.
- No.

1049
00:54:17,786 --> 00:54:19,219
This was really great...

1050
00:54:19,388 --> 00:54:21,618
...but it's too short.
It's so good, it should be longer.

1051
00:54:21,957 --> 00:54:24,255
Anyway, I told all my friends,
and they're excited.

1052
00:54:24,426 --> 00:54:26,621
- They want to join the store.
- Bring them in.

1053
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:28,023
Okay.

1054
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:30,222
Okay, it's open!

1055
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,832
Form two lines.

1056
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,436
Rentals on the right
and returns on the left.

1057
00:54:35,604 --> 00:54:36,832
The store policy is also...

1058
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:39,030
...two rentals per customer.

1059
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:41,369
Maybe you'd like to get a film
you didn't know about.

1060
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:45,110
Okay, guys, I'm accepting applications
in this line right here.

1061
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,611
- Hi.
- Hi.

1062
00:54:46,782 --> 00:54:48,807
- What would you like?
- This one Sweded, please.

1063
00:54:48,984 --> 00:54:51,646
Okay. Let me just check to see
if you have the proper documents.

1064
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,584
It seems like you have a lot of Cs.

1065
00:54:55,824 --> 00:54:57,815
I don't even think
you really should have passed.

1066
00:54:57,993 --> 00:55:00,962
So we're gonna need a $20
supplement fee for averageness.

1067
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,392
- Are you insane? Twenty dollars?
- I'm sorry.

1068
00:55:02,564 --> 00:55:03,861
I don't make the rules,
I just have to enforce them.

1069
00:55:04,032 --> 00:55:05,397
<i>You're crazy. You're insane.</i>

1070
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:07,296
- I'm leaving.
- You can bend a rule a little.

1071
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:10,029
- Your movies suck anyway!
- No.

1072
00:55:10,205 --> 00:55:11,638
Next!

1073
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:14,241
- Excuse me.
- Jerry.

1074
00:55:14,409 --> 00:55:16,104
I am RoboCop.

1075
00:55:16,512 --> 00:55:18,844
I heard there was a disturbance...

1076
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:22,006
...at Be Kind Rewind video store.

1077
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:24,414
Mr. RoboCop,
may I have an autograph, please?

1078
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:26,110
- For my grandson?
- Me too, me too.

1079
00:55:26,288 --> 00:55:31,282
Anything you say
can and will be held against you...

1080
00:55:32,194 --> 00:55:33,923
...in a court of RoboCop.

1081
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:35,487
<i>Miss Falewicz.</i>

1082
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:40,261
<i>- Hi, Miss Falewicz.
- Yeah.</i>

1083
00:55:40,435 --> 00:55:44,030
<i>- Can you Swede this for me?
- Oh, Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

1084
00:55:44,206 --> 00:55:45,833
I'd really rather not do this one.

1085
00:55:46,008 --> 00:55:49,000
I really never really got this movie.

1086
00:55:49,178 --> 00:55:50,805
I thought it was a little condescending.

1087
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:53,948
It's... It's a lovely movie.
Full of generosity and giving.

1088
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:56,050
- She teaches him to read.
- I know, ma'am.

1089
00:55:56,218 --> 00:55:58,812
How many movies
have that kind of heart?

1090
00:55:58,987 --> 00:56:00,318
Okay.

1091
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:03,424
Hoke, that's the spot.
Pull over the car.

1092
00:56:03,592 --> 00:56:05,651
- Stop the car right... Hoke!
- This is not the spot.

1093
00:56:05,827 --> 00:56:06,987
Are you...? Are you deaf?

1094
00:56:07,162 --> 00:56:08,595
- I wish I was deaf.
- This is the spot.

1095
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:10,823
Who is that hussy chasing after us?

1096
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:14,435
- Be gone, hussy. Hoke...
- You know we're not filming any of it?

1097
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:16,400
- We're just scouting.
- I know, I'm just practicing.

1098
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:18,403
I'm staying in character.
Come on, dude.

1099
00:56:18,574 --> 00:56:20,235
Let's keep in character, okay?

1100
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:22,809
- All right. Mm-hm.
- Come around the side and help me.

1101
00:56:22,978 --> 00:56:24,502
Help me get out of the car.

1102
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,942
- Hoke!
- Yes, ma'am.

1103
00:56:26,114 --> 00:56:27,843
- Jerry, have you ever seen the movie?
- Hoke.

1104
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:29,074
She doesn't act like that.

1105
00:56:29,251 --> 00:56:30,718
Don't you talk to me like that,
young missy.

1106
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:32,410
- She doesn't act like that.
- You stay over there.

1107
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:35,421
Hoke, go and find me the grave
that says Werthan on it.

1108
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:37,024
Go like the wind, run.

1109
00:56:37,192 --> 00:56:39,490
Run, Hoke. Please.

1110
00:56:39,661 --> 00:56:43,620
W-E-R-T-H-E-N.

1111
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:46,324
Hoke, can you hear me?

1112
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:48,435
Oh, no, Hoke.

1113
00:56:48,604 --> 00:56:50,231
You're illiterate, aren't you?

1114
00:56:50,405 --> 00:56:53,203
- Jerry.
- I'll teach you how to read.

1115
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:57,277
A W is like a mountain upside down.

1116
00:56:57,446 --> 00:56:58,811
Isn't that clever?

1117
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:01,211
<i>Now, what happens
if you add an "er"...</i>

1118
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:02,873
...to the W?
- Mike!

1119
00:57:03,051 --> 00:57:04,211
- What do you think?
- You get...

1120
00:57:04,386 --> 00:57:05,580
- Wer.
- Wer!

1121
00:57:05,754 --> 00:57:07,415
<i>Add a "then, " what do you get?</i>

1122
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:10,615
- Okay, Jerry, stop.
- Wer...

1123
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:12,350
- Would you stop?
- No.

1124
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:14,620
- Wer...
- Werthan, Werthan, Werthan, Werthan!

1125
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:16,229
Werthan, Werthan, Werthan, Werthan!

1126
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:17,831
- Mike.
- Knock it off.

1127
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,092
Mike, what are you doing?

1128
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:22,635
- Are we shooting?
- Jerry, come back.

1129
00:57:23,372 --> 00:57:25,135
Jerry.

1130
00:57:30,045 --> 00:57:32,639
- Hey.
- Don't mess around. I'm not in the mood.

1131
00:57:33,548 --> 00:57:36,039
You know, I was in character.

1132
00:57:36,218 --> 00:57:38,186
- I know.
- He didn't have to take it so personally.

1133
00:57:38,353 --> 00:57:42,346
Well, apparently he did. Jerry, like,
you crossed the line a little bit.

1134
00:57:42,557 --> 00:57:44,422
Don't you think
I have my share of humiliation?

1135
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:46,823
Who keeps on giving
the orders all day? He does.

1136
00:57:46,995 --> 00:57:48,223
- Uh-huh.
- Who keeps taking them?

1137
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:50,024
- Well, I kind of do all the time.
- No, no, no, no.

1138
00:57:50,198 --> 00:57:51,722
Me. And why should I?

1139
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,060
- Things have changed.
- Uh-huh.

1140
00:57:53,235 --> 00:57:54,725
<i>People recognize me in the street.</i>

1141
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:56,200
- Right, Simon?
- Yeah.

1142
00:57:56,371 --> 00:57:57,429
Yeah. Yup.

1143
00:57:57,606 --> 00:57:59,506
- Yeah.
- They love me. I want my own trailer.

1144
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:01,199
You have a trailer, okay?

1145
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:02,468
That is where you live.

1146
00:58:02,644 --> 00:58:04,009
- Is that spit on there?
- Yes.

1147
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:06,340
- Come on.
- Everybody does know you on the street...

1148
00:58:06,515 --> 00:58:09,313
...because all you do is go from your shop
to Mr. Fletcher's and back.

1149
00:58:09,484 --> 00:58:10,678
- It's true.
- No, you don't get it.

1150
00:58:10,852 --> 00:58:13,821
They look at me in a different way,
with love and resp...

1151
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:15,718
- I'm a star.
- You are a star.

1152
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:17,722
I want my own trailer
next to my trailer.

1153
00:58:17,893 --> 00:58:20,361
A movie trailer.
That trailer doesn't count.

1154
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,163
Get up, Jerry.

1155
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:26,062
- Everybody's ready.
- It's my time!

1156
00:58:26,234 --> 00:58:28,327
Ali's the man!

1157
00:58:31,373 --> 00:58:36,709
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

1158
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:38,345
It's okay. We're not suggesting...

1159
00:58:38,513 --> 00:58:42,279
As far as Foreman goes,
he was devastating that punching bag...

1160
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:45,386
...and we writers
were so frightened for Ali...

1161
00:58:45,554 --> 00:58:47,112
...that we were...
- It's incredible.

1162
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:50,816
The pilots are black, I'm black,
the whole plane is black...

1163
00:58:50,992 --> 00:58:53,051
...and we're not crashing.

1164
00:58:56,965 --> 00:59:00,025
Dave, it's me, HAL.

1165
00:59:00,202 --> 00:59:03,694
I'm afraid I can't open
the pod doors, Dave.

1166
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:07,035
Why don't you take a jog
around the space capsule?

1167
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:10,373
Okay, I'm ready. Go.

1168
00:59:45,614 --> 00:59:47,809
Alma! This is ketchup.

1169
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:51,214
- You said you were gonna use Kool-Aid!
- Sorry.

1170
00:59:51,386 --> 00:59:53,377
God, Alma.

1171
00:59:54,823 --> 00:59:56,586
Oh, where's the driver?

1172
00:59:57,492 --> 00:59:58,516
All right.

1173
00:59:58,693 --> 01:00:00,820
<i>We gotta stop off
and pick up an Enquirer.</i>

1174
01:00:02,197 --> 01:00:03,630
Find out what the aliens are doing.

1175
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:06,597
We're upside down!
Look, I'm upside down.

1176
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:11,000
The whole universe is in a marble!

1177
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:34,623
I'm glad you have come to your senses.

1178
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:36,695
I have a list of addresses here
for you to visit.

1179
01:00:36,864 --> 01:00:38,229
Hey, hey. No, no, no.

1180
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:41,800
Tomorrow, I am starting
a progressive transition...

1181
01:00:41,969 --> 01:00:45,405
...to a modern medium: the D VD.

1182
01:00:45,573 --> 01:00:48,599
You see, I've found
these affordable D VD players...

1183
01:00:48,776 --> 01:00:51,267
...that I'm going to recommend
to my customers.

1184
01:00:51,479 --> 01:00:53,447
Within a couple of months,
half of my catalogue...

1185
01:00:53,614 --> 01:00:55,673
...will be digital.
The rest, by the end of the year.

1186
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:59,013
Which means more titles
in the same space...

1187
01:00:59,186 --> 01:01:00,448
...and more business.

1188
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:02,646
Listen, if you don't want
the building demolished...

1189
01:01:02,823 --> 01:01:05,223
...then you're going to have to
make these renovations...

1190
01:01:05,393 --> 01:01:08,055
...with one of the city's
licensed contractors.

1191
01:01:08,229 --> 01:01:11,426
Do you have any idea of the kind of costs
we're talking about here?

1192
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,659
Here's an estimate
of the cost to repair the roof.

1193
01:01:14,835 --> 01:01:18,271
And that's the bare minimum
of work needed. I ...

1194
01:01:18,439 --> 01:01:20,999
- I just don't see it happening.
- Okay.

1195
01:01:21,175 --> 01:01:22,767
Okay, what?

1196
01:01:24,178 --> 01:01:25,270
I'll fix the roof.

1197
01:01:26,313 --> 01:01:27,678
Fine.

1198
01:01:27,982 --> 01:01:31,042
You now have six weeks before
Mr. Baker brings the demolition crew...

1199
01:01:31,218 --> 01:01:34,949
...then you're going to have to
relocate yourself at your own expense.

1200
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:44,989
Next!

1201
01:01:47,868 --> 01:01:49,096
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1202
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:50,601
Whoa, he cut the line!

1203
01:01:50,771 --> 01:01:52,602
- Hey, gramps.
- Hey.

1204
01:01:52,773 --> 01:01:55,003
Back of the line.
I've been waiting an hour out there.

1205
01:01:55,176 --> 01:01:56,803
- Yeah.
- I came all the way from New York.

1206
01:01:56,977 --> 01:01:58,205
New York, for real?

1207
01:01:58,379 --> 01:02:00,006
- Mike and Jerry are famous there?
- No.

1208
01:02:00,181 --> 01:02:01,705
- Hey, back out.
- My... My shop.

1209
01:02:01,882 --> 01:02:05,215
I'm really sorry, sir, but you're going
to have to go to the back of the line.

1210
01:02:05,386 --> 01:02:07,820
- I can't afford a riot in the shop.
- No, this is my business.

1211
01:02:07,988 --> 01:02:10,081
Can somebody explain to me
what's going on here?

1212
01:02:10,257 --> 01:02:12,623
- Hey, Mike! Where's Mikey? Mike!
- Mr. Fletcher.

1213
01:02:12,793 --> 01:02:14,420
- What's going on, man?
- Oh, hey.

1214
01:02:14,595 --> 01:02:16,426
I can... I can explain everything.

1215
01:02:17,064 --> 01:02:19,225
Something terrible happened
with the tapes.

1216
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,265
They all got erased.

1217
01:02:21,435 --> 01:02:24,233
I know you didn't want Jerry
to come into the store...

1218
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:25,667
...but...
- Jerry?

1219
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,037
All right, this is the last autograph.
My fingers are getting tired. I'm serious.

1220
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,700
- Oh, man.
- I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1221
01:02:30,878 --> 01:02:33,005
Let me take your bag for you,
then I can explain...

1222
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:36,115
Uh-oh, who's back? Mr. Fletchy.
Hey, welcome home, man.

1223
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:37,773
I got the slogan. Check it out:

1224
01:02:37,952 --> 01:02:41,183
<i>"Be Kind Rewind, Videos a la Carte.</i>

1225
01:02:41,455 --> 01:02:42,820
You name it, we shoot it.

1226
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,821
<i>Be Kind Rewind, Videos a la Carte. "</i>

1227
01:02:44,992 --> 01:02:46,823
- Jerry.
- That's great. I think he gets it.

1228
01:02:46,994 --> 01:02:49,827
- Thanks, Jerry.
- It's snappy. Just put a little drums under it.

1229
01:02:49,997 --> 01:02:51,828
- We'll just...
- I didn't mean to scream at you.

1230
01:02:51,999 --> 01:02:54,297
- I didn't know that you were the boss.
- You know what I mean?

1231
01:02:54,468 --> 01:02:56,902
Listen, kids.
I appreciate your creativity...

1232
01:02:57,071 --> 01:02:59,403
...but let's be realistic for a second.

1233
01:02:59,573 --> 01:03:03,407
We will never hit that number,
and the building will be gone.

1234
01:03:03,577 --> 01:03:05,204
Oh, no, Mr. Fletcher. We can do it.

1235
01:03:05,379 --> 01:03:07,210
We've... We've been doing really,
really good.

1236
01:03:07,381 --> 01:03:09,349
You know, we've been working hard.
We grow every day.

1237
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:12,611
It's far from enough.
We need to adapt to the market.

1238
01:03:12,787 --> 01:03:15,415
So to hell with documentaries...

1239
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:17,784
...oldies, cult movies.

1240
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:20,085
We need to simplify.

1241
01:03:20,261 --> 01:03:21,523
Two sections.

1242
01:03:21,695 --> 01:03:24,630
Action-adventures, comedies.
That's it.

1243
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,199
We got to keep the silent movies,
the Fats movies.

1244
01:03:27,368 --> 01:03:29,928
No, no. Quiet. I don't wanna hear
any more about Fats Waller.

1245
01:03:30,504 --> 01:03:33,439
New rules apply
from tomorrow morning.

1246
01:03:35,709 --> 01:03:38,177
Oh, and I forgot.

1247
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:42,645
D VDs.

1248
01:03:42,817 --> 01:03:44,284
D VD, what?

1249
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,143
No more tapes.

1250
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,756
The entire catalogue has to be on D VD
by the end of the year.

1251
01:03:49,924 --> 01:03:51,152
And our films?

1252
01:03:51,325 --> 01:03:53,259
Yours and whatever we rent
from my store.

1253
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:05,972
I don't know why he's doing this.

1254
01:04:06,674 --> 01:04:09,404
It's like everything
that we've been doing...

1255
01:04:09,577 --> 01:04:12,546
...is just nothing? It's... Just like...

1256
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:15,015
- We can't keep doing this.
- No way.

1257
01:04:15,182 --> 01:04:19,209
We are doing better business
than this store has ever done.

1258
01:04:19,386 --> 01:04:21,013
We're... We're celebrities now.

1259
01:04:21,188 --> 01:04:23,452
We're on the power list.
He has to listen to us.

1260
01:04:23,624 --> 01:04:26,388
No. No, he don't.
I should've known.

1261
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:30,155
It's my fault. I should've known.
He don't like... He don't like remakes.

1262
01:04:31,065 --> 01:04:32,225
It's worthless to him.

1263
01:04:32,399 --> 01:04:35,493
It's like I'm nothing to him.
I just... I just work here.

1264
01:04:40,474 --> 01:04:42,499
Filthy little punk.

1265
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:50,475
No way this punk kid
gonna put his filth on my piano.

1266
01:04:57,558 --> 01:05:00,550
<i>No, I erased all the tapes.</i>

1267
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:02,526
I'm the little punk.

1268
01:05:03,898 --> 01:05:07,197
Why is it always about you guys?

1269
01:05:07,368 --> 01:05:08,801
What about me?

1270
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:10,800
What about Alma?

1271
01:05:11,772 --> 01:05:14,832
I wanna be a filthy punk too,
you know?

1272
01:05:15,576 --> 01:05:19,376
These are not just simple remakes.

1273
01:05:19,546 --> 01:05:21,741
They are way more creative.

1274
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:24,384
Of course, if the business
maintains its current progress...

1275
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:26,576
...we won't hit the objective.

1276
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:29,154
But if we shorten
the length of the films...

1277
01:05:29,323 --> 01:05:30,984
...we can shoot more of them.

1278
01:05:31,158 --> 01:05:35,117
And we will incrementally increase
the increase of the income.

1279
01:05:35,296 --> 01:05:37,821
- Can you repeat the last...?
- No, Alma.

1280
01:05:37,998 --> 01:05:41,434
- People will feel swindled.
- Not if we include them in the films.

1281
01:05:41,602 --> 01:05:43,001
We'll give them parts to play.

1282
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:46,196
This way: A, with their help,
we can make more movies...

1283
01:05:46,373 --> 01:05:49,001
... B, the films can be shorter
and they won't feel swindled.

1284
01:05:49,176 --> 01:05:52,339
They're not gonna feel cheated,
they won't feel swindled...

1285
01:05:52,513 --> 01:05:54,606
...and they'll see their selves as a part...
- Yes.

1286
01:05:54,782 --> 01:05:56,147
...of the neighborhood.
- They'll become the stockholders...

1287
01:05:56,317 --> 01:05:57,614
...of their own happiness.

1288
01:05:57,785 --> 01:06:00,379
You guys, this is something
we can build on.

1289
01:06:00,554 --> 01:06:03,455
If we do more movies
in a shorter time, we can...

1290
01:06:03,624 --> 01:06:05,455
- We can rent more movies.
- That's what I'm saying.

1291
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:08,219
- Wait, that's what I just said.
- I thought it before you said it.

1292
01:06:08,395 --> 01:06:10,022
- Doesn't matter who said it first.
- No... Jerry.

1293
01:06:10,197 --> 01:06:11,789
We're all saying...
We're all on the same page.

1294
01:06:11,966 --> 01:06:14,594
- I agree, I agree.
- I wanna be a part of this team officially.

1295
01:06:14,768 --> 01:06:16,429
It's like... What do you call that,
when snow falls...?

1296
01:06:16,603 --> 01:06:19,003
- Avalanche.
- No, when... Snowballing.

1297
01:06:19,173 --> 01:06:21,971
- Snowballing. Getting bigger and bigger.
- That's an avalanche.

1298
01:06:22,142 --> 01:06:25,202
<i>And it incrementally increases
the snowball size.</i>

1299
01:06:25,379 --> 01:06:28,473
- Come on. Right here. I can feel this.
- We need to do this.

1300
01:06:28,649 --> 01:06:30,742
- Go.
- Explode! Big success.

1301
01:06:34,955 --> 01:06:39,790
<i>Do you really wanna buy these expensive
and overly complicated D VD players?</i>

1302
01:06:40,094 --> 01:06:42,187
<i>No. No way.</i>

1303
01:06:42,363 --> 01:06:45,924
<i>So for only $ 20,
you can purchase this digital unit...</i>

1304
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:49,069
<i>... you can simply tape or glue
into your VCR...</i>

1305
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:53,199
<i>... and then it upgrades
into our Be Kind Rewind D VD player.</i>

1306
01:06:53,374 --> 01:06:56,343
<i>And only then is when
you can play our Be Kind Rewind...</i>

1307
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:59,206
<i>- That is good.
...D VDs.</i>

1308
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,541
<i>Vacation with Chevy Chase.
Comedy, please.</i>

1309
01:07:01,715 --> 01:07:03,205
- That's not Sweded yet. Sorry.
- Comedy.

1310
01:07:03,384 --> 01:07:06,012
<i>- Comedy.
- The Jerk, action.</i>

1311
01:07:06,186 --> 01:07:08,620
Wrong genre. That is a comedy.

1312
01:07:08,789 --> 01:07:10,723
I must exclude you for the day.

1313
01:07:10,891 --> 01:07:12,984
You can come back tomorrow.
That's the new system.

1314
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,422
You have to say the right thing.

1315
01:07:14,595 --> 01:07:16,290
Man, the new system sucks, man.

1316
01:07:16,463 --> 01:07:18,226
I'm sick and tired of all these rules.

1317
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,197
<i>- Hey, Lord of the Rings is not a comedy.
- We didn't insult your new rules.</i>

1318
01:07:21,368 --> 01:07:23,836
<i>Now, listen. I want The Jerk...</i>

1319
01:07:24,171 --> 01:07:26,639
...Sweden by tomorrow.
- Sweded, Sweded.

1320
01:07:26,807 --> 01:07:28,434
- Sweded.
- Sweded by tomorrow...

1321
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:31,203
...or this little thing that's in your...

1322
01:07:31,378 --> 01:07:33,312
Let me see, let me see.

1323
01:07:33,781 --> 01:07:36,841
I'd be lying if I said
I was not waiting for this opportunity...

1324
01:07:37,017 --> 01:07:38,211
...to teach you a lesson.

1325
01:07:38,385 --> 01:07:40,819
Mr. Fletcher,
this is really hurting my arm, okay?

1326
01:07:40,988 --> 01:07:42,956
<i>Listen, I apologize, okay?</i>

1327
01:07:43,123 --> 01:07:46,024
- Good, good.
- l... I will follow the new rules.

1328
01:07:46,193 --> 01:07:47,626
Good. But more importantly...

1329
01:07:47,795 --> 01:07:50,195
...you should never
threaten your auntie again.

1330
01:07:50,364 --> 01:07:52,832
She works very hard
to keep a roof over your head.

1331
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,297
And these guys...

1332
01:07:54,468 --> 01:07:56,959
...are working very hard to save ours.

1333
01:07:57,137 --> 01:07:58,536
- You get my drift?
- Yeah, I got it.

1334
01:07:59,006 --> 01:08:00,997
Thank you for the lesson.

1335
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:06,071
Sounds like Fats Waller's
back in the house.

1336
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:07,508
It's... It's his house.

1337
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:12,908
<i>Now, my boy, do you know where
our Fats...</i>

1338
01:08:13,087 --> 01:08:15,146
<i>... did record most of his tunes
and why?</i>

1339
01:08:15,322 --> 01:08:17,017
<i>- I know that one.
- I'm not sure.</i>

1340
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:18,590
<i>- I know the answer.
- Mike?</i>

1341
01:08:18,859 --> 01:08:20,622
<i>At RC A Studios in Camden.</i>

1342
01:08:20,794 --> 01:08:24,252
<i>They liked to drive there on the train on the
way to the studio so they can get drunk.</i>

1343
01:08:24,431 --> 01:08:26,058
<i>Sometimes they didn 't
even get to the studio...</i>

1344
01:08:26,233 --> 01:08:28,463
<i>... because they would get in a fight
or they'd get arrested.</i>

1345
01:08:28,635 --> 01:08:31,604
<i>Mr. Fletcher, I don 't really see
the connection with my lesson.</i>

1346
01:08:31,772 --> 01:08:34,741
There is none.
We changed the subject.

1347
01:08:38,278 --> 01:08:39,575
Set up the cameras over there.

1348
01:08:39,746 --> 01:08:42,180
We wanna get in the red car
to do a little make-out session.

1349
01:08:46,053 --> 01:08:48,851
<i>We're walking in the rain.
It's kind of warm and fuzzy, and I kiss you.</i>

1350
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:51,982
And we're like young lovers.

1351
01:08:53,427 --> 01:08:54,860
Wow, these guys are good.

1352
01:08:56,563 --> 01:08:57,621
They can shoot any style.

1353
01:08:57,798 --> 01:08:59,425
We cast Jack and his friends.

1354
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:01,960
- Whatever, man.
- You hear what he's saying, man?

1355
01:09:02,136 --> 01:09:03,831
Yo, see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
01:09:04,004 --> 01:09:05,995
Come on.
You want some of this, buddy?

1357
01:09:06,173 --> 01:09:08,073
I'm shooting him.

1358
01:09:08,242 --> 01:09:10,676
Oh, no. Derek!

1359
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:12,235
Why?

1360
01:09:12,412 --> 01:09:14,676
Look at the pool of blood around him.

1361
01:09:14,848 --> 01:09:16,008
He's with Jesus.

1362
01:09:16,183 --> 01:09:19,209
What's happening to our 'hood?
It's no good.

1363
01:09:19,386 --> 01:09:22,844
<i>It's senseless, the violence.</i>

1364
01:09:36,103 --> 01:09:38,799
Kids, I have to admit...

1365
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:42,334
... I was wrong.

1366
01:09:42,509 --> 01:09:45,307
To movies with heart.

1367
01:09:45,812 --> 01:09:48,007
<i>- And soul.
- I remember the sandwiches too.</i>

1368
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:50,150
<i>- We had pig ears.
- Just look at Mr. Fletcher there.</i>

1369
01:09:51,518 --> 01:09:53,247
<i>- Pig ears and white bread.
- I smell elephant.</i>

1370
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:56,079
You're the number one hunter
in the world.

1371
01:09:56,256 --> 01:09:57,985
When you see that elephant,
you know that you have to kill it.

1372
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:00,724
- That's great. We did it.
- And cut.

1373
01:10:00,894 --> 01:10:01,918
Now we're like animals.

1374
01:10:03,497 --> 01:10:05,362
I love you, I love you.
I'm having sex with you.

1375
01:10:10,304 --> 01:10:13,000
We're nearly there. One more week.

1376
01:10:13,173 --> 01:10:15,971
<i>"Jerry and Alma in..."
"Jerry and Alma in..."</i>

1377
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:21,504
Jerry and Alma, Jerry and Alma,
Jerry and Alma.

1378
01:10:22,616 --> 01:10:24,584
Are you jealous or something?

1379
01:10:24,751 --> 01:10:26,810
No. No, I'm not.

1380
01:10:26,987 --> 01:10:29,581
Forget about what I even said.
Don't... I'm sorry.

1381
01:10:29,756 --> 01:10:31,724
Well... Well, really. I mean...

1382
01:10:31,892 --> 01:10:35,350
... how come he's always
the one with you in the movies?

1383
01:10:35,529 --> 01:10:36,996
It's always him.

1384
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:41,032
Well, Jerry said
that you complained about my...

1385
01:10:41,201 --> 01:10:42,293
That is a dirty lie.

1386
01:10:42,469 --> 01:10:46,303
I never said a word about your mustache.
I didn't say anything about it.

1387
01:10:47,774 --> 01:10:50,709
I never said my mustache.

1388
01:10:51,144 --> 01:10:52,736
Okay, so Jerry was telling the truth.

1389
01:10:52,913 --> 01:10:54,904
And that's why you never wanted
to kiss me or anything.

1390
01:10:55,082 --> 01:10:57,141
No, no. I never complained about that.

1391
01:10:57,317 --> 01:10:59,217
Mike, I never said the word,
and you did.

1392
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:00,546
So how would you know, huh?

1393
01:11:00,721 --> 01:11:03,212
Because he complains about it
all the time, to tell you the truth.

1394
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:04,482
What's the difference?

1395
01:11:04,658 --> 01:11:06,922
- You think I have one, right?
- No. Really, to be perfectly honest...

1396
01:11:07,094 --> 01:11:09,187
... I don't even think you have one.
- I wish I was dead right now.

1397
01:11:09,363 --> 01:11:11,422
Just really quick. Let me see.

1398
01:11:14,201 --> 01:11:16,601
You know what? I don't see anything.

1399
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:19,999
- I don't see anything.
- You don't see it?

1400
01:11:20,173 --> 01:11:21,663
No.

1401
01:11:22,943 --> 01:11:23,967
Thanks.

1402
01:11:24,144 --> 01:11:26,078
Maybe I should give you a blind test.

1403
01:11:26,246 --> 01:11:27,804
Yeah, I think we need a blind test.

1404
01:11:32,586 --> 01:11:34,110
So?

1405
01:11:35,122 --> 01:11:37,920
Hey! You're trying to kiss me.

1406
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:39,820
<i>- Why not?
- "Why not"?</i>

1407
01:11:39,993 --> 01:11:42,018
- Are you in love with me?
- Huh?

1408
01:11:42,195 --> 01:11:43,787
Mm-hm.

1409
01:11:43,964 --> 01:11:45,090
Well, how do I know that?

1410
01:11:45,265 --> 01:11:46,857
You know you're in love
with a person...

1411
01:11:47,034 --> 01:11:50,026
...when you talk to them for a minimum
of 20 minutes a day in your head.

1412
01:11:50,203 --> 01:11:53,195
What if I talk to a guy in my head
for 20 minutes? What would that mean?

1413
01:11:53,373 --> 01:11:54,965
You're in love with Jerry.

1414
01:11:55,142 --> 01:11:57,440
- Huh? Ew, no. We're closed.
- Yes, you are in love with Jerry.

1415
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,340
- No, I'm not.
- Hey, Mike, you hear the door?

1416
01:11:59,513 --> 01:12:01,344
Not at all. No, that's not... It c...

1417
01:12:01,515 --> 01:12:03,005
Listen, it could be anybody.

1418
01:12:03,183 --> 01:12:05,845
- Mr. T, Fats.
- You are in love with him.

1419
01:12:06,019 --> 01:12:07,919
- I know it.
- Mr. Elroy Fletcher.

1420
01:12:08,088 --> 01:12:09,919
Yes.

1421
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:11,216
To whom it may concern...

1422
01:12:11,391 --> 01:12:15,191
...copyright infringement is punishable
by state and federal law.

1423
01:12:15,362 --> 01:12:18,126
Now, I hold in my hand a restraining order
from Trenton...

1424
01:12:18,298 --> 01:12:23,201
<i>...and, actually, a warrant of seizure
from Washington D.C.</i>

1425
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:24,962
- So you, the defendant...
- What's up?

1426
01:12:25,138 --> 01:12:27,800
... have declined to attend
the judgment proceedings...

1427
01:12:27,974 --> 01:12:31,239
...so the studios are coordinating
to assess...

1428
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:34,209
...the damages from...
How many titles is it?

1429
01:12:34,381 --> 01:12:36,281
- Approximately 200.
- Okay. So...

1430
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,008
Oh, what do we have here?

1431
01:12:38,185 --> 01:12:40,016
- A record of rental.
- Oh.

1432
01:12:40,187 --> 01:12:42,951
- What?
- Two hundred titles times...

1433
01:12:43,123 --> 01:12:44,283
... how many average viewings?

1434
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:45,982
Sixty-three times per tape.

1435
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:50,027
Times 250,000 maximum in damages...

1436
01:12:50,197 --> 01:12:54,463
...and/or up to five years in prison...

1437
01:12:54,634 --> 01:12:57,398
...per offense.
- Which adds up to...

1438
01:12:57,571 --> 01:13:01,200
...3. 15 billion dollars in fines...

1439
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:03,036
...which would need to be paid back
to the studios...

1440
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:05,838
- I'll write you a check.
...and/or...

1441
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:09,808
...63,000 years in prison.

1442
01:13:09,983 --> 01:13:14,420
Which, of course, would have to be served
before you could reopen the store.

1443
01:13:14,588 --> 01:13:17,056
But we made the movies ourselves.

1444
01:13:17,224 --> 01:13:18,623
- They're our...
- And people like them.

1445
01:13:18,792 --> 01:13:21,818
You're... You're right. But technically,
you're wrong. You see, these tapes...

1446
01:13:21,995 --> 01:13:23,223
...belong to the studios.

1447
01:13:23,397 --> 01:13:26,560
Look, it's written.
FBI warning, right there.

1448
01:13:26,733 --> 01:13:28,064
It's at the beginning of the tape
as well.

1449
01:13:28,235 --> 01:13:32,228
- But we erased that, so...
- I think it's...

1450
01:13:32,406 --> 01:13:34,601
People come here because
they want to see these movies.

1451
01:13:34,775 --> 01:13:38,404
That's why they come here. They're not
interested in those formulaic big movies.

1452
01:13:38,578 --> 01:13:40,307
They're not interested in them.
They don't wanna see them.

1453
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,777
Sir. Sir.
Taste has nothing to do with this.

1454
01:13:41,948 --> 01:13:43,506
Don't listen to them.
Mr. Fletcher, you can kick them out.

1455
01:13:43,683 --> 01:13:45,241
- The entire film industry is crumbling...
- They're trespassing.

1456
01:13:45,419 --> 01:13:46,545
...because of pirates and bootleggers.

1457
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,188
And we intend to stop it.
Right now, right here.

1458
01:13:49,356 --> 01:13:52,382
We're not selling boots,
and we're not... We're not pirates.

1459
01:13:52,559 --> 01:13:54,925
- And we don't have viruses.
- I'm sorry, Mr...

1460
01:13:55,095 --> 01:13:56,653
- Fletcher.
- Mr. Fletcher.

1461
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,627
I mean, look.
I have a family too, okay?

1462
01:13:58,799 --> 01:14:01,393
I didn't say I do. I mean,
what has this got to do about a family?

1463
01:14:01,568 --> 01:14:04,662
Nevertheless,
this writ gives us permission...

1464
01:14:04,838 --> 01:14:08,399
...to destroy all your black-market tapes
by the end of the day...

1465
01:14:08,575 --> 01:14:11,669
...and all of these assets
in the store...

1466
01:14:11,845 --> 01:14:14,814
<i>...are hereby seized
to pay these penalties to the studios.</i>

1467
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:17,040
No, no, no. These are... No, no, no.
Not the...

1468
01:14:17,217 --> 01:14:18,650
We just want to get in and out...

1469
01:14:18,819 --> 01:14:21,219
...as painlessly as possible.
- Those are Sweded!

1470
01:14:21,388 --> 01:14:22,548
Hey, let him go.

1471
01:14:28,628 --> 01:14:30,027
Mr. Fletcher?

1472
01:14:30,197 --> 01:14:31,630
Mr. Fletcher.

1473
01:14:31,798 --> 01:14:33,595
I could save the building.
I got a plan B.

1474
01:14:33,767 --> 01:14:37,396
This is a application to make it
a historical landmark.

1475
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:39,971
I can't believe
that I didn't remember it before.

1476
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,506
It's gonna be easy,
because Fats was born here.

1477
01:14:43,076 --> 01:14:45,943
No, Mike, it's not so simple.

1478
01:14:46,112 --> 01:14:48,171
Why not?
You can go get his birth certificate.

1479
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:50,976
The address has got to be on the birth
certificate. Go check the public records.

1480
01:14:51,151 --> 01:14:53,619
No, Mike,
we can't provide any documents...

1481
01:14:53,787 --> 01:14:56,620
...to prove that Fats lived here.

1482
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:58,758
You wanna know why?

1483
01:14:59,459 --> 01:15:00,926
Huh? You wanna know why?

1484
01:15:02,629 --> 01:15:04,221
- Because...
- No, no.

1485
01:15:04,397 --> 01:15:05,659
- No, no, listen.
- I don't wanna...

1486
01:15:05,832 --> 01:15:07,663
Now you don't want
to finish my sentences, huh?

1487
01:15:07,834 --> 01:15:09,267
Boy, look here. I'll finish it.

1488
01:15:09,436 --> 01:15:12,997
We can't prove
Fats Waller lived here...

1489
01:15:13,173 --> 01:15:15,368
...because he never did.

1490
01:15:28,188 --> 01:15:30,179
I think you should come one more time.

1491
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,951
Just tell me why.

1492
01:15:39,566 --> 01:15:42,433
Well, they started as bedtime stories.

1493
01:15:42,602 --> 01:15:44,695
I was trying to make this place
bearable for you.

1494
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:49,399
And then I could never bring myself
to tell you the truth.

1495
01:15:49,576 --> 01:15:52,010
Well, why Fats Waller?

1496
01:15:52,178 --> 01:15:53,543
You could have picked anybody.

1497
01:15:54,781 --> 01:15:58,080
I mean, Duke Ellington
or Louis Armstrong or...

1498
01:15:58,251 --> 01:16:00,014
Fats was a happy man.

1499
01:16:00,186 --> 01:16:02,848
And I thought
it would make you happy.

1500
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:06,123
And it's true, I lied.

1501
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:09,487
Now I'm going to hell, upstairs.

1502
01:16:17,737 --> 01:16:20,729
Here we are, we're the villains, right?

1503
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:56,370
Hold that.

1504
01:17:11,824 --> 01:17:13,758
Mike!

1505
01:17:13,927 --> 01:17:16,157
We want more movies.

1506
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:18,160
We want more movies!

1507
01:17:18,331 --> 01:17:20,162
Come on, baby.

1508
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:23,234
Mike, wake up, baby.
We need to make more movies.

1509
01:17:23,403 --> 01:17:25,667
- What are you doing?
- Look at all these people here.

1510
01:17:25,838 --> 01:17:27,635
- We want more movies, man.
- Yeah.

1511
01:17:27,807 --> 01:17:31,470
We cannot do these movies anymore.
It's illegal.

1512
01:17:31,644 --> 01:17:32,906
You can make your own.

1513
01:17:33,079 --> 01:17:36,845
- I don't have ideas for movies, Jerry.
- Oh, bullpucky.

1514
01:17:37,016 --> 01:17:40,144
You have got tons of ideas.
Brilliant ideas.

1515
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,379
I hear them,
you mumble them in your sleep.

1516
01:17:42,555 --> 01:17:45,991
Mike, we can make
any movie we want.

1517
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:49,322
We don't have to make one... They can't
sue us if we're making new ones.

1518
01:17:49,862 --> 01:17:53,491
<i>Make whatever you want.
Make Rush Hour 6, whatever.</i>

1519
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:55,133
You know what I mean?

1520
01:17:55,301 --> 01:17:58,498
<i>Let's make Scary Town 5000.</i>

1521
01:17:58,671 --> 01:18:00,434
We make it up, baby.

1522
01:18:00,607 --> 01:18:02,404
- You're the best director I know.
- Wait a minute.

1523
01:18:02,575 --> 01:18:03,599
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm the best actor...

1524
01:18:03,776 --> 01:18:05,368
...that I know.
- I have an idea.

1525
01:18:05,545 --> 01:18:08,309
And together we're a team
that can't be stopped!

1526
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:11,848
Mike. Where did you go? Come back.

1527
01:18:12,018 --> 01:18:13,076
Come on, Mike.

1528
01:18:13,252 --> 01:18:15,220
I want Mr. Fletcher to see.

1529
01:18:15,388 --> 01:18:17,720
Mr. Fletcher.

1530
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:21,158
Mr. Fletcher!

1531
01:18:21,327 --> 01:18:22,726
What do you need me for?

1532
01:18:23,329 --> 01:18:24,796
To hell with them, Mr. Fletcher.

1533
01:18:24,964 --> 01:18:28,058
We don't have to move to the projects
if we don't want, we can stay right here.

1534
01:18:28,234 --> 01:18:30,498
How do we do that, exactly?

1535
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:32,535
We're gonna make a movie, all of us.

1536
01:18:32,705 --> 01:18:34,536
All of these people
came out to support us.

1537
01:18:34,707 --> 01:18:36,265
We're gonna make a movie together.

1538
01:18:36,442 --> 01:18:37,704
Like the city that saves itself?

1539
01:18:37,877 --> 01:18:40,311
No, no. Check it, check it.

1540
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,847
We're gonna do a movie
about Fats Waller's life.

1541
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:46,076
Your hero, my hero.

1542
01:18:46,252 --> 01:18:50,018
And we don't need permission
to make movies on our own.

1543
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:51,679
This is for us to watch.

1544
01:18:51,858 --> 01:18:54,725
- The whole town is participating.
- It'll be ours.

1545
01:18:54,894 --> 01:18:57,886
<i>The movie could be called
Fats Was Born in Passaic.</i>

1546
01:18:58,064 --> 01:19:00,828
- Yeah!
- Everybody knows I was lying.

1547
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,231
- You gonna humiliate me again?
- No. No, Mr. Fletcher.

1548
01:19:04,404 --> 01:19:06,565
No, he's trying to prove you were right.

1549
01:19:06,739 --> 01:19:10,573
Our past belongs to us,
we can change it if we want.

1550
01:19:10,743 --> 01:19:13,735
Sure. My mom...

1551
01:19:13,913 --> 01:19:18,077
My mom saw Fats Waller playing...

1552
01:19:18,251 --> 01:19:21,516
Playing the piano right here
in the Passaic Theater.

1553
01:19:21,688 --> 01:19:25,146
Sure. Anybody wanna
say anything about that?

1554
01:19:25,324 --> 01:19:26,484
Yes, me.

1555
01:19:26,659 --> 01:19:31,119
My grandfather used to watch him
play Bach every night in the church.

1556
01:19:31,297 --> 01:19:34,357
- There you go.
- My great-uncle saved his life.

1557
01:19:34,534 --> 01:19:38,800
He took the train to Camden
to record in the RCA studios.

1558
01:19:38,971 --> 01:19:41,405
He really did take the train to Camden.

1559
01:19:41,574 --> 01:19:42,836
That's right!

1560
01:19:43,009 --> 01:19:45,239
Mike. We only have a week
before the demolition.

1561
01:19:45,411 --> 01:19:46,776
It's not a problem. That's okay.

1562
01:19:46,946 --> 01:19:48,937
We'll shoot the whole thing in a week.

1563
01:19:49,115 --> 01:19:51,106
And we could take donations
to see the movie...

1564
01:19:51,284 --> 01:19:52,945
...and use the money
to save the building.

1565
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:56,020
- I'll play Fats.
- No, no. You're not. I'm gonna play Fats.

1566
01:19:56,189 --> 01:19:57,247
We'll see who plays Fats.

1567
01:19:57,423 --> 01:19:59,357
- You're not gonna play Fats.
- We'll see. There'll be an audition process.

1568
01:19:59,525 --> 01:20:00,924
No, there's not.
You're not gonna play Fats.

1569
01:20:01,094 --> 01:20:02,652
- May the best man play Fats.
- Okay.

1570
01:20:02,829 --> 01:20:04,091
Anyway, we should do it.

1571
01:20:05,698 --> 01:20:07,165
Good idea.

1572
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:18,571
- Test, test, test.
- It looks like it's working.

1573
01:20:18,745 --> 01:20:19,939
- I can't tell if it's working.
- I think it's working...

1574
01:20:20,113 --> 01:20:21,171
...because this is pressed down.
- All right.

1575
01:20:21,347 --> 01:20:23,212
<i>- Test. I can 't tell.
- It's working.</i>

1576
01:20:23,382 --> 01:20:25,077
- Yeah, that's... Okay.
- It's working.

1577
01:20:25,251 --> 01:20:28,982
But it all started right here
at 261 Main Street.

1578
01:20:29,155 --> 01:20:33,353
<i>Miss Falewicz, can you tell us
some of the true history of Fats Waller?</i>

1579
01:20:33,526 --> 01:20:36,791
Fats was born
in Mr. Fletcher's video store.

1580
01:20:36,963 --> 01:20:39,431
He was the youngest
of seven children...

1581
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:44,036
...and all of them died
before they even got to be 5.

1582
01:20:44,203 --> 01:20:45,500
- Gangsters killed them all.
- Yep.

1583
01:20:45,671 --> 01:20:49,163
- They came low-riding.
- Yup, they just shot them. They were like:

1584
01:20:49,342 --> 01:20:50,775
- They were like ninjas.
- Yeah.

1585
01:20:50,943 --> 01:20:52,535
But, boys, there's nothing fun about it.

1586
01:20:52,712 --> 01:20:54,612
- They were awful.
- It was kind of fun, though...

1587
01:20:54,781 --> 01:20:55,805
...if you think about it.

1588
01:20:55,982 --> 01:20:59,179
What is the first instrument
that Fats learned to play?

1589
01:21:00,052 --> 01:21:03,783
- From what I recall it was the piano.
- I think it was the harmonium, actually.

1590
01:21:03,956 --> 01:21:06,186
Yes, she's correct.

1591
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:11,353
And he moved on to play one of the
biggest instruments in the music business.

1592
01:21:11,531 --> 01:21:12,555
And that's the organ.

1593
01:21:12,732 --> 01:21:16,498
He would spend nights here
playing, like, Bach.

1594
01:21:16,669 --> 01:21:19,331
You know, here at the great organ here.
Right here.

1595
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:24,472
You guys, listen. There's a lot of
different ways we can start the movie...

1596
01:21:24,644 --> 01:21:28,580
...but I'm just putting my vote in,
we start at Fats' birth.

1597
01:21:28,748 --> 01:21:29,840
Boring.

1598
01:21:30,449 --> 01:21:33,213
Hey, man. I think we should have the
gangsters. You know what I'm saying?

1599
01:21:33,386 --> 01:21:36,378
- With the:
- I like that.

1600
01:21:36,556 --> 01:21:39,525
Everybody, listen, listen.
Start with the death.

1601
01:21:39,692 --> 01:21:42,024
- But that's backwards.
- No, it's not backwards at all.

1602
01:21:42,195 --> 01:21:44,459
<i>That is like Citizen Kane.
You are an original.</i>

1603
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:45,961
If you're going backwards...

1604
01:21:46,132 --> 01:21:49,727
...then do the people talk, like,
backwards in the scene?

1605
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:10,347
<i>Ain 't misbehavin '
Saving all my lovin ' for you</i>

1606
01:22:13,926 --> 01:22:16,190
You know... I'm fat. Fats is fat.

1607
01:22:16,362 --> 01:22:18,922
That's his name.
So I thought I could...

1608
01:22:19,098 --> 01:22:23,933
You thought wrong.
But let's have a conversation about this.

1609
01:22:24,103 --> 01:22:25,593
Just a brief conversation.

1610
01:22:25,771 --> 01:22:28,433
He's not even fat.
I don't even think he looks like him at all.

1611
01:22:28,608 --> 01:22:30,371
- Be quiet.
- Go outside.

1612
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:34,170
Somebody's about to get knocked out.

1613
01:22:35,548 --> 01:22:37,413
Kansas City, the train station,
the death scene.

1614
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:39,710
Mr. Jack, Mr. Jack. It's going.

1615
01:22:39,886 --> 01:22:42,320
It's good. It's good.
Thank you, Andrea.

1616
01:22:42,488 --> 01:22:44,649
<i>- What the hell is a "harmoninium" anyway?
- Harmonium.</i>

1617
01:22:44,824 --> 01:22:47,349
Okay, what is it, just a weird thing
that makes harmonies?

1618
01:22:47,526 --> 01:22:48,584
- It's fine.
- I give up.

1619
01:22:48,761 --> 01:22:50,126
You got the keyboard here already.

1620
01:22:50,296 --> 01:22:51,786
Fats liked to tickle the piano, right?

1621
01:22:51,964 --> 01:22:53,932
So my hand touches
the black keys, the white keys.

1622
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,431
- It's wrong.
- And then we tickle.

1623
01:22:55,601 --> 01:22:57,728
- Tickle, tickle, tickle.
- Fats played a piano, not a finger machine.

1624
01:22:57,904 --> 01:22:59,895
- You gotta put something there with keys.
- It's funny.

1625
01:23:00,072 --> 01:23:02,836
<i>It's cheating. You're just lazy.
You gotta put something in there.</i>

1626
01:23:03,009 --> 01:23:05,273
Doesn't look very much like the '20s.

1627
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:06,934
- It's clearly a bathtub.
- This goes?

1628
01:23:07,113 --> 01:23:09,513
No, forget it. You know what?
Forget it. I got a better idea.

1629
01:23:09,682 --> 01:23:12,082
We gotta have a bunch of them anyway.
You know what I'm thinking?

1630
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:14,344
- What?
- Get me some cardboard.

1631
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:20,358
Hey, look, this is how
you make it look old.

1632
01:23:20,526 --> 01:23:23,256
The fan give the impression
that it's a old film.

1633
01:23:23,429 --> 01:23:25,294
And the string is for the scratches.
See?

1634
01:23:25,464 --> 01:23:26,931
This is for the voice-over.

1635
01:23:27,099 --> 01:23:29,624
<i>Miss Falewicz, can you tell us
some of the true history...?</i>

1636
01:23:29,802 --> 01:23:31,827
And also this is for the music.

1637
01:23:32,004 --> 01:23:35,531
<i>Fats was born
in Mr. Fletcher's video store.</i>

1638
01:23:37,576 --> 01:23:39,373
And push and breathe.

1639
01:23:39,545 --> 01:23:43,311
<i>And make a groaning sound like,
"Oh, there's a baby coming out of me."</i>

1640
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:45,950
Wilson, send the kids.

1641
01:23:46,118 --> 01:23:47,813
<i>- Some gangsters killed them all.
- Yep.</i>

1642
01:23:47,987 --> 01:23:51,081
<i>- They came low-riding.
- They were like ninjas.</i>

1643
01:23:54,827 --> 01:23:57,227
<i>And I heard
that there was glass everywhere.</i>

1644
01:23:57,396 --> 01:23:59,387
<i>The gang was like a pizza gang.</i>

1645
01:23:59,565 --> 01:24:02,500
<i>And when they killed you, there was
always a pizza behind you on the wall.</i>

1646
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:04,898
Fall, fall. Mr. Jack, fall.

1647
01:24:05,838 --> 01:24:08,636
<i>When he was young he used to follow
his father around the streets...</i>

1648
01:24:08,808 --> 01:24:11,038
<i>... because his father
was a street minister.</i>

1649
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:15,442
Even if I ascended to heaven,
thou art there.

1650
01:24:15,614 --> 01:24:17,479
Clap your hands.

1651
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,345
- Does it look good or what?
- Yeah.

1652
01:24:19,518 --> 01:24:21,179
Continue to jiggle.

1653
01:24:21,354 --> 01:24:23,254
- Tickle the keys, Mike.
- I'm doing it.

1654
01:24:23,422 --> 01:24:25,014
I can clearly see
that you're not doing it.

1655
01:24:25,191 --> 01:24:27,182
- I barely can see...
- I'm clearly doing it.

1656
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:30,387
Yeah. Okay.

1657
01:24:31,597 --> 01:24:34,088
Wilson, how do you drive a train?

1658
01:24:34,266 --> 01:24:35,858
Push up the switches
on the generator.

1659
01:24:36,035 --> 01:24:37,400
Okay. I got it.

1660
01:24:40,039 --> 01:24:41,404
Yeah!

1661
01:24:50,383 --> 01:24:51,850
Alma, you in position?

1662
01:24:52,018 --> 01:24:54,145
We're just crossing the river now.
You see us?

1663
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,084
<i>Yeah, I can see you.
I'm starting the camera.</i>

1664
01:24:59,058 --> 01:25:02,550
Come on, blow that trombone harder.
That is not a piccolo. Mike.

1665
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:07,097
You need to act more drunker.
Come on, you guys are better than that.

1666
01:25:07,266 --> 01:25:08,290
Action!

1667
01:25:16,409 --> 01:25:20,004
<i>Let me tell you, rent party
was the place to be in the '20s and '30s.</i>

1668
01:25:20,179 --> 01:25:23,410
<i>Man, they were jumping.</i>

1669
01:25:26,052 --> 01:25:28,816
Clear out, clear out. Cops are coming.
Cops are coming, come on.

1670
01:25:39,331 --> 01:25:40,355
Alma.

1671
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,431
Go, go, go.

1672
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:44,034
Aren't you guys being
a bit ambitious here?

1673
01:25:44,203 --> 01:25:45,670
No. This is what makes the movie.

1674
01:25:45,838 --> 01:25:47,703
All right, all right.
This is getting dangerous.

1675
01:25:47,873 --> 01:25:52,105
- Promise me this is it.
- We promise, Mr. Fletcher.

1676
01:25:52,278 --> 01:25:54,678
Okay, go, go.

1677
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:58,744
Not the big one, not the big one.

1678
01:25:58,918 --> 01:26:01,478
- What's it matter?
- Do the little one, okay?

1679
01:26:01,654 --> 01:26:04,214
<i>- No, no, no. It says use other door.
- Jeez.</i>

1680
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:07,655
- Okay, fine, just shield your...
- Just let the car go by.

1681
01:26:17,403 --> 01:26:19,997
- What is this? What the crap?
- God dang it.

1682
01:26:20,172 --> 01:26:22,367
I told you I wanted
to break the big glass.

1683
01:26:31,083 --> 01:26:33,108
Why? It's like a hall of mirrors.

1684
01:26:33,285 --> 01:26:35,685
- What the crap, what is this?
- That's it. I'm going home.

1685
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:40,751
Come on, let's go.

1686
01:26:42,027 --> 01:26:46,157
- Be careful. It's over there.
- Shut up.

1687
01:26:47,466 --> 01:26:49,024
- You got it?
- Yep.

1688
01:26:49,201 --> 01:26:52,170
You got it?

1689
01:26:52,805 --> 01:26:53,999
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1690
01:26:54,173 --> 01:26:55,640
What...?

1691
01:26:55,808 --> 01:26:57,537
Mike?

1692
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:00,577
- Mike, what are you doing?
- Nothing. We were leaving, don't hurt us.

1693
01:27:00,746 --> 01:27:03,579
- Of course I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Why do you got that knife then?

1694
01:27:03,749 --> 01:27:06,081
- I thought you were robbers, man.
- Jerry, help me.

1695
01:27:06,252 --> 01:27:08,311
Okay, hold on. Hold on, hold on.

1696
01:27:08,487 --> 01:27:10,455
Release.

1697
01:27:14,126 --> 01:27:17,960
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1698
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:20,394
Are you...? Are you sleeping here?

1699
01:27:20,566 --> 01:27:22,329
I n the hardcore-porn room?

1700
01:27:22,501 --> 01:27:25,993
Temporarily, yes,
I am sleeping here, okay?

1701
01:27:26,172 --> 01:27:28,106
I don't want anybody
to know this, all right, please?

1702
01:27:28,274 --> 01:27:29,298
Fellas, I tell you what.

1703
01:27:29,475 --> 01:27:33,070
I'll fix the windows,
you keep that quiet.

1704
01:27:33,245 --> 01:27:34,269
- Okay.
- Please.

1705
01:27:34,446 --> 01:27:35,879
We just gonna go.

1706
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:38,778
Okay, let's go. Stealth.

1707
01:27:48,194 --> 01:27:50,685
- Don't get involved. Don't get involved.
- Is that it?

1708
01:27:52,665 --> 01:27:54,462
I tried to hold them back
as best I could. Guys, we can't...

1709
01:27:54,633 --> 01:27:55,657
- We got a job to do.
- I know you do.

1710
01:27:55,834 --> 01:27:57,802
- It's on. It's on.
- All right.

1711
01:27:59,171 --> 01:28:01,935
Come on in. Everybody, don't
forget to put money in the can.

1712
01:28:02,107 --> 01:28:04,473
- We're trying to raise money.
- Every dollar helps.

1713
01:28:04,643 --> 01:28:08,079
You know, if you got a 20, that's gonna
help even more. That's more valuable.

1714
01:28:08,247 --> 01:28:10,078
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

1715
01:28:10,249 --> 01:28:11,511
Hey there. Yes, sir. Thank you.

1716
01:28:11,684 --> 01:28:13,311
Make sure you have
a donation for church.

1717
01:28:13,485 --> 01:28:16,283
I will do. All right then. Thank you, sir.
The check will be fine.

1718
01:28:16,455 --> 01:28:17,581
All right.

1719
01:28:17,756 --> 01:28:20,953
Can you put the TV a little bit higher?

1720
01:28:22,261 --> 01:28:23,285
All right.

1721
01:28:23,462 --> 01:28:26,056
This is exciting. Oh, a 20.

1722
01:28:26,232 --> 01:28:27,824
It's gonna work, right?

1723
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,661
Well, I took the offer.

1724
01:28:29,835 --> 01:28:31,928
It looks like we're gonna be
moving to the projects.

1725
01:28:32,104 --> 01:28:36,040
The money we collect tonight is not gonna
be enough to even start the work.

1726
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:40,167
So, what we gonna do is watch the movie.
And then we go.

1727
01:28:40,346 --> 01:28:42,075
- Come on. All right?
- She can't see the TV.

1728
01:28:42,248 --> 01:28:43,272
- Can you see it now?
- Yeah.

1729
01:28:43,449 --> 01:28:45,974
- Hey, where's Mike?
- Okay.

1730
01:28:46,151 --> 01:28:49,086
Have a little faith, you guys,
he's gonna be here.

1731
01:28:49,255 --> 01:28:52,713
If you can just remain patient,
and don't forget to put money in the can.

1732
01:28:52,891 --> 01:28:56,418
<i>- Mike, Mike, Mike!
- Everybody stay cool.</i>

1733
01:28:56,595 --> 01:29:01,157
<i>Mike, Mike, Mike!</i>

1734
01:29:10,609 --> 01:29:14,841
<i>Who would expect a simple influenza virus
would get him in his bed?</i>

1735
01:29:15,014 --> 01:29:17,983
Mike. Mike, stop shooting now.

1736
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:20,948
- What are you doing?
- I'm just getting the end shot.

1737
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,554
- I have to get the end titles.
- It doesn't have to be perfect.

1738
01:29:23,722 --> 01:29:27,453
Yeah, I know what time it is.
I've been looking... I've been here all day.

1739
01:29:27,626 --> 01:29:31,027
Yeah. No, we... I didn't start the job.

1740
01:29:31,196 --> 01:29:35,929
I can't demolish a building
with a hundred people in it, that's why.

1741
01:29:36,101 --> 01:29:37,625
Right, good idea.

1742
01:29:37,803 --> 01:29:39,065
He's coming down.

1743
01:29:40,472 --> 01:29:42,406
What is this?

1744
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:48,603
- Mike's here.
- Hey, look who's here.

1745
01:29:50,783 --> 01:29:53,809
Oh, no.

1746
01:29:55,354 --> 01:29:58,653
No one could see it,
so I had to put it up on a higher thing.

1747
01:29:58,824 --> 01:30:01,088
- You messed up the TV, man.
- I messed up the TV.

1748
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,421
So how we gonna watch it?

1749
01:30:05,564 --> 01:30:09,193
Yo, Fletcher.
What the hell's going on here?

1750
01:30:09,368 --> 01:30:13,771
Well, right now, we need you, baby.
We need you.

1751
01:30:13,939 --> 01:30:15,702
- Right here, right here.
- What is that?

1752
01:30:15,874 --> 01:30:18,308
- Is this what you've been looking for?
- It's a projector?

1753
01:30:18,477 --> 01:30:21,241
- Where shall I put the monster?
- Right here, right here.

1754
01:30:21,413 --> 01:30:23,506
Put this right here.
This is the finest machinery...

1755
01:30:23,682 --> 01:30:25,707
...made for mankind.
- Oh, my God.

1756
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:27,374
- I saved the day.
- Yeah.

1757
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:29,578
- Okay. That's good.
- It's dangerous in here.

1758
01:30:29,755 --> 01:30:32,349
To tell you the truth, I don't think people
could have seen the little TV...

1759
01:30:32,524 --> 01:30:34,151
...from the back anyway.
It would've been...

1760
01:30:34,326 --> 01:30:35,884
I think everybody should turn around
and watch...

1761
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:38,529
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Everyone, turn your seats around.

1762
01:30:38,697 --> 01:30:40,961
We're gonna watch the movie
up on the wall now.

1763
01:30:41,133 --> 01:30:42,691
- Yes, we are.
- And it's much better.

1764
01:30:42,868 --> 01:30:44,768
It's actually... It's a blessing in disguise.

1765
01:30:44,937 --> 01:30:46,734
Because the TV...
We were gonna watch it on a TV this big.

1766
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:48,065
You ain't gonna see an image
brighter than this.

1767
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,832
You will never see an image
sharper than this.

1768
01:30:50,008 --> 01:30:53,239
Now, that's a premiere.
Make it as big as you can.

1769
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:57,143
Make it as... Yeah.
Stretch it from there all the way to there.

1770
01:30:57,316 --> 01:30:59,216
Anything you need...

1771
01:30:59,385 --> 01:31:01,512
Just keep your hands off this.
This is fine machinery.

1772
01:31:01,687 --> 01:31:04,656
- I will. I promise.
- We did it!

1773
01:31:07,559 --> 01:31:09,925
All right, let's get it going.
Let's get this show on the road.

1774
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:13,656
- Yeah!
- That's what we waiting for.

1775
01:31:32,684 --> 01:31:36,347
<i>Well, it all began right here,
on this spot.</i>

1776
01:31:36,522 --> 01:31:38,080
<i>It was a different neighborhood then,
but look here...</i>

1777
01:31:38,257 --> 01:31:40,191
<i>... he was born in 261 Main Street.</i>

1778
01:31:40,359 --> 01:31:42,486
<i>It's a boy.</i>

1779
01:31:47,332 --> 01:31:48,731
Here's our part. Here's our part.

1780
01:31:48,901 --> 01:31:51,495
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah!

1781
01:31:52,438 --> 01:31:55,100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1782
01:32:15,561 --> 01:32:18,724
<i>Yes, in the Century Theater,
right here in Passaic.</i>

1783
01:32:18,897 --> 01:32:20,831
Mr. Fletcher? What's going on?

1784
01:32:20,999 --> 01:32:23,433
Oh, hi, Mr. Baker.

1785
01:32:24,937 --> 01:32:27,201
- Let's step outside.
- Wait, hold on a second, Mr. Fletcher.

1786
01:32:27,372 --> 01:32:29,135
I'm sorry, but time is up.
We agreed on this.

1787
01:32:29,308 --> 01:32:31,572
Now, you must evacuate the building
so we can start.

1788
01:32:31,743 --> 01:32:35,144
Okay. Mr. Baker, you're right.

1789
01:32:35,314 --> 01:32:37,646
We should've evacuated an hour ago.

1790
01:32:37,816 --> 01:32:42,014
But, please,
let us watch our film. Okay?

1791
01:32:42,187 --> 01:32:45,679
And if you give me just one hour,
I promise there won't be a riot.

1792
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:49,025
An empty building,
and you can pull it down.

1793
01:32:49,194 --> 01:32:51,253
It's all yours.

1794
01:32:51,763 --> 01:32:54,994
- Please.
- You have one hour.

1795
01:32:56,168 --> 01:32:57,430
One hour.

1796
01:33:00,973 --> 01:33:04,773
<i>Fats' life was on a train.</i>

1797
01:33:04,943 --> 01:33:06,240
<i>He had given up flying.</i>

1798
01:33:06,411 --> 01:33:10,575
<i>He was tired of being refused entrance
to the plane because of his color.</i>

1799
01:33:12,751 --> 01:33:15,982
<i>Once, however,
segregation saved his life.</i>

1800
01:33:16,688 --> 01:33:21,523
<i>The plane he had been rejected from
crashed in Kansas City.</i>

1801
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:57,294
<i>Fats, are you okay?</i>

1802
01:33:57,462 --> 01:33:58,861
<i>Fats, you okay?</i>

1803
01:33:59,798 --> 01:34:02,096
<i>Oh, my God, you're... Fats, wake up.</i>

1804
01:34:02,267 --> 01:34:04,599
<i>Fats.</i>

1805
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:07,398
<i>Is there a doctor on the train?</i>

1806
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:13,007
<i>Help! Help! Help!
Is there a doctor on the train?</i>

1807
01:34:13,178 --> 01:34:14,475
<i>We need a doctor!</i>

1808
01:34:14,646 --> 01:34:16,978
<i>He 's my friend!</i>

1809
01:34:17,149 --> 01:34:21,245
<i>Anybody? This train 's not leaving
until we get a doctor!</i>

1810
01:36:00,986 --> 01:36:05,013
<i>Say up in Harlem at a table for two</i>

1811
01:36:05,957 --> 01:36:09,654
<i>There were four of us
Me, your big feet and you</i>

1812
01:36:10,328 --> 01:36:13,297
<i>From your ankle up
I'll say you sure are sweet</i>

1813
01:36:14,099 --> 01:36:17,000
<i>From there down
There 's just too much feet</i>

1814
01:36:17,169 --> 01:36:19,603
<i>Yes, your feet's too big</i>

1815
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:23,473
<i>Don 't want ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>

1816
01:36:24,843 --> 01:36:27,607
<i>Can 't use you 'cause your feet's too big</i>

1817
01:36:28,447 --> 01:36:32,008
<i>I really hate ya 'cause your feet's too big
Yeah</i>

1818
01:36:38,557 --> 01:36:40,616
<i>Where 'd ya get 'em?</i>

1819
01:36:42,694 --> 01:36:46,221
<i>Your girl, she likes you
She thinks you're nice</i>

1820
01:36:46,932 --> 01:36:50,231
<i>Got what it takes to be in paradise</i>

1821
01:36:50,402 --> 01:36:52,302
<i>She said she likes your face</i>

1822
01:36:52,471 --> 01:36:54,268
<i>She likes your rig</i>

1823
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,873
<i>Man, oh, man, them things are too big</i>

1824
01:36:58,043 --> 01:37:00,477
<i>Oh, your feet's too big</i>

1825
01:37:01,313 --> 01:37:04,544
<i>Don 't want ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>

1826
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:08,777
<i>Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big</i>

1827
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:12,186
<i>I hate ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>

1828
01:37:31,009 --> 01:37:33,000
<i>Are you good? Is that good?</i>

1829
01:37:33,512 --> 01:37:38,074
This Chinese bamboo ain't strong.
I can't believe you got me out here.

1830
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:42,550
Forget about the bamboo,
we gotta go solve a crime.

1831
01:37:59,805 --> 01:38:06,643
<i>There 's more to life
Than this old place, hey</i>

1832
01:38:07,045 --> 01:38:11,778
<i>Put your dreams in suitcase</i>

1833
01:38:13,819 --> 01:38:20,622
<i>Go to explore another land</i>

1834
01:38:21,092 --> 01:38:27,292
<i>Stand in a spot you never planned</i>

1835
01:38:28,133 --> 01:38:34,697
<i>You can scoot
Or put down roots</i>

1836
01:38:35,307 --> 01:38:41,542
<i>Use my boot
I'll be there too</i>

1837
01:38:42,214 --> 01:38:48,278
<i>You can scoot
Or put down roots</i>

1838
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:55,286
<i>Use my boot
They'll be there too</i>

1839
01:38:56,161 --> 01:39:02,191
<i>You'll meet new folks
And listen close</i>

1840
01:39:03,435 --> 01:39:07,872
<i>This song hits brand-new notes</i>

1841
01:39:10,475 --> 01:39:16,710
<i>Our town 's not great
But nothin ' wrong</i>

1842
01:39:17,682 --> 01:39:23,814
<i>Far from the world where we belong</i>

1843
01:39:24,656 --> 01:39:30,720
<i>You can scoot
Or put down roots</i>

1844
01:39:31,696 --> 01:39:37,396
<i>Use my boot
I'll be there too</i>

1845
01:39:38,637 --> 01:39:44,974
<i>You can scoot
Put down roots</i>

1846
01:39:45,644 --> 01:39:51,879
<i>Use my boot
They'll be there too</i>

1847
01:40:07,165 --> 01:40:13,263
<i>Sit before me
Tell your story</i>

1848
01:40:14,339 --> 01:40:18,867
<i>Now here I'm close to you</i>

1849
01:40:21,646 --> 01:40:27,881
<i>Pocket a book
Of letters you got</i>

1850
01:40:28,954 --> 01:40:33,323
<i>I'll tell it better than you thought</i>

1851
01:40:36,294 --> 01:40:42,597
<i>You can scoot
Or put down roots</i>

1852
01:40:43,601 --> 01:40:49,938
<i>Use my boot
I'll be there too</i>

1853
01:40:50,909 --> 01:40:56,905
<i>You can scoot
Put down roots</i>

1854
01:40:57,816 --> 01:41:03,914
<i>Use my boot
I'll be there too</i>

1855
01:41:05,457 --> 01:41:11,919
<i>You can scoot
Put down your roots</i>

1856
01:41:12,097 --> 01:41:18,969
<i>Use my boots
They'll be there too</i>
