2
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:21,896
Hart, can you get me
Miss Arizona's number?

3
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:25,192
-Why would l do that, Clonsky?
-Because she needs a man in her life.

4
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:27,494
Yeah? Where do you fit in?

5
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:31,332
-Nice. Nice talk. Not too congenial, Hart.
-Yeah.

6
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:34,067
lt says right here
you're supposed to be real amiable.

7
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:36,939
That's three weeks ago.
l've been amiable since then...

8
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:38,909
...and now l just
wanna hit somebody.

9
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:40,844
Well, this could be your chance, Hart.

10
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:43,610
Okay, let's go over this one more time.
The Housewives...

11
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:47,016
...they knocked off nine banks in a month
and wounded two guards.

12
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,523
We got a tip this bank is their next target.
So stay frosty. Keep your heads up.

13
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:56,394
You know you can't wear a swimsuit
on this mission, right, Hart?

14
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:57,926
That's good.

15
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,502
-What happened to world peace?
-lt comes and goes.

16
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:19,752
Control to Big Mama.

17
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:21,822
Check your baby.

18
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:25,283
Hey, honey.

19
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:31,363
-Control, this is Big Mama. Confirm.
-Confirm, Big Mama. Proceed on in.

20
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:37,229
-Big Daddy and Big Mama are inside.
-Copy that.

21
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,336
l hope we wrap this early.
l have Yankee tickets tonight.

22
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:44,674
What are you up to?

23
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:48,248
Just basic paperwork, and then
l got company coming over for dinner...

24
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,250
...so l just need to do a little--
A little defrosting.

25
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,754
-Oh, your boyfriend Eric's coming over?
-He's not my boyfriend. Just--

26
00:02:55,924 --> 00:03:00,657
We're just friends, you know? Friends
and coworkers. Friendly coworkers.

27
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,060
Hey, you ever been to the Poconos?

28
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,799
Where is that? What is that,
New York? Pennsylvania?

29
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:11,402
You think it'd be hard
to get a reservation there?

30
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:13,905
What, for you and your coworker?

31
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:17,705
-That's so sweet, two agents in love.
-Yeah.

32
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,247
So l guess this is a good time to tell you
that this is not your baby.

33
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,988
Housewives, front door. Housewives.

34
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:35,988
How old?

35
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:38,428
-Thirty-five.
-No, the baby. Can l take a peek?

36
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,626
No, get lost, lady.
We haven't changed his diaper in a week.

37
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:45,967
You're that Miss Congeniality lady.

38
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:49,238
No, l'm not. l'm not. l'm not.

39
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:51,902
l saw you on TV
on the Miss United States pageant.

40
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,843
No, ma'am. Ma'am, you did not.

41
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,382
-You're Gracie Hart!
-Ma'am, no. Ma'am, please--

42
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:57,813
-Gracie Hart?
-Gracie Hart?

43
00:03:57,986 --> 00:04:00,147
-Gracie Hart!
-No, l'm not! l'm not! l'm not!

44
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:01,619
-She's FBl!
-l'm not!

45
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,987
-lt's a setup!
-Okay, nobody move! Nobody move!

46
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,128
Nobody's moving. Ma'am, please be--

47
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,457
Please be quiet! Get down!
Nobody's moving.

48
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:12,327
-Get down, please! Please, get down!
-Down, l said. Down!

49
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,197
Nobody's moving. lt's okay.
Ma'am, get down! Get down!

50
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,329
We've got a hostage situation.
We need backup. Now!

51
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:22,606
-We gotta move, ladies!
-Okay. Okay, it's okay.

52
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:24,507
Get your hand out of the purse, Hart.

53
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:28,780
You too, hubby, get your hands up
where l can see them.

54
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:32,083
Tell me where every other agent is
in this bank.

55
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:38,820
Now.

56
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,027
Now!

57
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:45,598
There's one in the baby carriage.

58
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,906
-Freeze, FBl!
-FBl, freeze!

59
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:58,409
Put the gun down!
Put the guns down!

60
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:10,249
-Take her. Take--
-Got her.

61
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,159
Clonsky, where are you hit?
Where are you hit?

62
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:14,989
-ln the vest. l'm--
-Where?

63
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,926
l'm all right. l'm all right.

64
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,726
-Oh, my God.
-lt hurt like a mother.

65
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,492
l know.

66
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:29,134
But l got something that's gonna
make you feel a lot better.

67
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:34,442
Here we go, 602-555-01 99.

68
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:36,413
What's that?

69
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:38,551
Miss Arizona's number.

70
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:42,381
-You couldn't tell me earlier?
-No.

71
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:44,491
-What do we got?
-l'm okay.

72
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:47,059
Excuse me.

73
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:49,458
Would you mind?

74
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,808
Hart! Hart!

75
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:07,472
-Sorry, sir.
-Let's not make a bad day worse.

76
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:09,512
Sir...

77
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:13,176
...about the bank,
l don't know what happened.

78
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:16,756
lt was like my high school reunion,
except these people liked me.

79
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:19,826
Well, l think we can all agree
it didn't go according to plan.

80
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,429
But l wanna talk to you
about something else.

81
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:25,395
This is some fan mail we've gotten
for you since the pageant.

82
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:28,593
Letters, cards, chocolates.

83
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,103
l'll take the chocolates.

84
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:34,834
''Dear Miss Hart,
l saw you on the pageant...

85
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,410
...and the next night
l was coming out of a party...

86
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:40,139
...when this horrible guy
grabbed me in the parking lot.

87
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:44,680
So l did your SlNG self-defense,
and he totally backed off.

88
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:48,550
l've gone through some tough times lately,
and you have no idea what it means...

89
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:51,692
...to feel like you can stand up
for yourself again.

90
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:56,461
l just wanted to say thank you
and you look beautiful in your e--''

91
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,690
-Evening gown?
-Evening gown.

92
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,859
-She liked it?
-Lori, Newark.

93
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:06,038
Sir, you're reading my mail.
That's a class-B misdemeanor.

94
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,645
Hart, l've been getting five calls a day
for you to be on talk shows.

95
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:12,939
The Bureau's had
some bad publicity lately...

96
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:17,211
...and the director thinks you could be
the new face of the FBl.

97
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:22,651
Sir, l'm just a field agent.

98
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:26,851
Most field agents don't have the president
calling them at home to congratulate them.

99
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,792
l can't believe l hung up on him.
l thought it was Clonsky.

100
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:34,265
This is important, Hart.
Go home, have a nice dinner...

101
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:36,936
...and think about it.

102
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,466
Well...

103
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:42,269
...l could use a nice dinner, sir.

104
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:44,210
l'll think about it.

105
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:33,050
Hart.

106
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:36,229
Well, hello, Agent Matthews.

107
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:41,199
No, l'm just putting the finishing touches
on your chicken potpie. Yeah.

108
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:45,897
l think l'm gonna make some man
very, very happy someday.

109
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:47,905
Listen, l wanna ask you something.

110
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:51,239
Do you know if the Poconos
are in New York or Pennsylvania?

111
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:54,507
Because l cannot seem to get
a clear answer on this.

112
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:57,151
Because l was thinking
that maybe this weekend...

113
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:02,018
...we could take a little drive down there,
do a little exploring, do--

114
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:04,052
Why, aren't--?

115
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:08,729
Why do you wanna talk tomorrow? l mean,
aren't you gonna be here in 1 0 minutes?

116
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:17,335
Oh, well, l thought we were moving
at kind of a normal speed. l--

117
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:23,341
Well, l don't need any more space.
l mean--

118
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:27,572
You know, it's not like l expect us
to get married or anything, but l--

119
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:35,520
Well, what is it? l mean, is it--?

120
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:40,421
ls it the way l snort? l mean,
because l don't have to snort.

121
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:43,860
Or is it the--? ls it the sex? Because....

122
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:50,126
You know, l could--
l could get a manual or something.

123
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,210
Well, no.

124
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:03,181
No, you don't have to explain.

125
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:10,487
No. No, you know what? You know what?
l have to-- l have to go.

126
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,654
Don't worry about dinner. l....

127
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:19,027
Mrs. Flammenbaum next door
invited me to a surprise...

128
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:21,964
...keg party.
You know what? l have to go.

129
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,967
Okay.

130
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:27,507
Bye.

131
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:12,173
-This is where the health plan kicks in.
-You ain't kidding.

132
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:21,788
-Morning, sir.
-Hey.

133
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:24,720
l'd really like to talk to you
for a minute, if l could.

134
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:26,724
Hart, have you been crying?

135
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:30,729
No. No. l don't cry.
l don't even have tear ducts.

136
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:40,470
Sam Fuller. Transferred in
from Chicago last week...

137
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:43,270
...because of
anger-management problems.

138
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:47,006
Really? She seems like
such a people person.

139
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:50,416
l've been giving this a lot of thought...

140
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:55,318
...and given the fact that going out on ops
has become problematic in light of...

141
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,185
...the bank thing....

142
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:01,954
Well, l have decided to become
the new face of the FBl.

143
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,860
l really wanna be there
and support the Bureau...

144
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:09,265
...and be a positive role model for women.
l feel like this is a great ti--

145
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:12,905
Oh, yeah. No way you could've seen me
standing there.

146
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:14,302
-Sorry.
-You were saying?

147
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,501
Hey! Yo!

148
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:20,273
-How about a real ''sorry,'' huh?
-Come again?

149
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:22,245
-You heard me.
-This is gonna be great.

150
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,409
l said, how about a real ''sorry''?

151
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:28,889
You are about to feel some real pain
if you don't back off.

152
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:32,584
Hey, you know what? Don't talk to me
about pain, sister. l invented pain.

153
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,421
No, you didn't just call me sister.

154
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:38,760
l don't recall seeing a little, skinny-ass
white girl at the table growing up.

155
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,959
Hey! First of all,
thank you for calling me skinny.

156
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:44,195
Second of all, what is your problem?

157
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,806
And third of all,
you better apologize to me or--

158
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:49,375
-Make me!
-You know, l don't make trash. Come on!

159
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:54,311
-Come on.
-Knock it off, Fuller. Take a shower.

160
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:56,450
That's right, take a shower. Walk away.

161
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,950
-You lucky you still can walk!
-You want more?

162
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,611
-Take a shower. Go on.
-Come here.

163
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,957
That's right, go on. Keep walking.

164
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:08,052
Hart.

165
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:11,329
You were saying?

166
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:17,062
Oh, a positive role model for women, sir.

167
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:22,036
l want you to talk to someone
before we schedule any appearances.

168
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,735
Someone who can help
with personal-presentation issues.

169
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:27,746
Clothing, makeup, so forth.
He comes very highly recommended.

170
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,043
l just went through a makeover
for the pageant.

171
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:33,517
l'm still getting hairspray off my butt.

172
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:38,989
What? lt prevents the bathing suit
from riding up. Thank you.

173
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,425
Sir, l just don't wanna become
FBl Barbie again.

174
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:43,825
What's your option?

175
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:47,434
You can't go in the field without putting
yourself and agents in jeopardy.

176
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:50,537
-That part of your life is over.
-Sir, it can't be.

177
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:53,367
That's all that l know how to do.
That's all that l have.

178
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,533
You gotta make a choice.
Sit at a desk pushing papers...

179
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:59,680
...or be out there
boosting the Bureau's image?

180
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:03,609
Look, when you make up your mind,
let me know.

181
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:07,119
Rachel, did those transfer papers
for Matthews come through?

182
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:09,381
On your desk, sir.

183
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:14,461
Sir, is Agent Matthews
going someplace?

184
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,290
Miami.

185
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:22,267
He's gonna be assistant SAC.
Going to the top, that boy.

186
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:27,331
Sir.

187
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:31,010
Sorry.

188
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:36,078
You know, l'll meet whoever
you want me to meet.

189
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,945
Good.

190
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:54,294
Oh, l hope she's not a fatty.

191
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:57,461
Joel Myers, Gracie Hart.

192
00:15:57,939 --> 00:15:59,372
Oh, yes.

193
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,207
Yes.

194
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:04,345
l can work with this.

195
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:07,037
You will be my Mona Lisa,
my Sistine Chapel.

196
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:10,582
-l will find the sculpture in the stone.
-Slow down, da Vinci.

197
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,549
How do you feel about a pushup bra?

198
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,951
How do you feel about
a genital-shocking taser gun?

199
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:18,991
l'm open to it.

200
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:21,819
Okay.

201
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:25,124
Are you open to new experiences,
like becoming the face of the FBl?

202
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:28,894
-l did the pageant, l can do this.
-That was three days. This is your life.

203
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,935
That was teaching a dog
a few new tricks.

204
00:16:31,105 --> 00:16:33,539
This is teaching a dog
to become a butterfly.

205
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,939
Not that you're a dog.
They generally have smoother hair.

206
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:42,313
Look, just-- You know, just tell me
what you want me to do, and l'll do it.

207
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:45,612
-Rule number one, no hitting.
-What?

208
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:50,349
The face of the FBl uses her words,
not her fists or a chair.

209
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,550
Rule number two,
chew with your mouth closed.

210
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,922
-You don't know how l eat.
-You have ketchup stains all over you.

211
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:59,396
How did they get there
if they didn't fall from an open orifice?

212
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:03,465
l don't know.
Maybe l walked under a ketchup tree.

213
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:07,941
Rule number three, no snorting.

214
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:10,842
Why don't you just take the list.

215
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:20,943
And l truly believe you are capable
of great class and style.

216
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:28,391
And, may l say, l also recently
went through a breakup.

217
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,455
l didn't go through a breakup.

218
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:33,725
Puffy eyes, no sleep, irritable.

219
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:37,364
And some of the other agents
told me about it.

220
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:41,304
But believe me, you do as l say,
and you will make him regret it...

221
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:46,072
...because people care about people
who care about themselves.

222
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,982
-So it's all in here?
-No, it's all in here.

223
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:57,386
America wants a star.
So you have to become a star.

224
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:00,459
You have to dress and treat
your friends like you're a star.

225
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:03,028
You have to treat yourself like a star.
Before you--

226
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:05,026
l know, l know. l'm a big star!

227
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:08,657
Our next guest was the runner-up
at last year's Miss United States pageant.

228
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:12,297
We found out
she was actually an FBl agent...

229
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:14,839
...on a mission to thwart an attack
on the pageant.

230
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:16,874
You can read about it
in her new book...

231
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:19,535
...From Misdemeanors
to Miss Congeniality.

232
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:22,581
Here's Agent Gracie Hart.

233
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:25,983
-Hi, Gracie.
-Regis. Good to see you.

234
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:27,883
-Joy.
-How are you?

235
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:30,751
-What a great suit.
-Thank you, and you look fabulous.

236
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:34,725
-Thank you.
-This is not how l picture an FBl agent.

237
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:37,121
You don't look anything
like J. Edgar Hoover.

238
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:40,233
Oh, really? Because this is his dress.

239
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:45,066
-Listen, l watched the pageant--
-l bet you did, Regis.

240
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,400
Every year, actually. lt's embarrassing.

241
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:50,942
My favorite part was the women's
self-defense thing, you know?

242
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:52,579
Could you give us an encore?

243
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:56,046
Actually, l don't do that anymore.
l have someone who does it for me.

244
00:18:56,217 --> 00:19:00,176
So, if l could, l'd like to bring out
a little friend of mine, Agent Sam Fuller...

245
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:02,948
...who will be helping us
with the demonstration.

246
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:05,584
Here she is.

247
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:10,194
So, Regis, if we could have you
come over to the mat.

248
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:11,922
Fuller.

249
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,632
Stand right here
with Fuller in front of you.

250
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,497
-All right, Regis, grab her.
-She looks angry.

251
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:23,440
-Do l have to grab her?
-Go ahead. She has no place else to be.

252
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:28,881
All right, ladies, if you'll please remember,
the word is ''SlNG.'' Solar plexus...

253
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:31,382
...instep...

254
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:32,780
...nose...

255
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:35,980
-...and groin.
-Not the groin! No!

256
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:40,852
Very nice. Thank you, Agent Fuller.

257
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:43,792
Come on, Regis, let's get you up.

258
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:51,500
Thanks, Gracie. And as a special treat
for knocking my husband around...

259
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:55,130
...l have a little surprise for you.
l think you know these people.

260
00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:01,805
Here's Cheryl Frazier, Miss United States,
and Stan Fields, host of the pageant.

261
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:06,948
lt's you!

262
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:10,549
-l love your lipstick.
-You do? Stila made it for me.

263
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:13,956
-They named it after me. lt's called Gracie.
-That makes sense.

264
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:16,961
-You did something to your hair.
-Just a couple of highlights.

265
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:18,792
-A couple?
-Okay, okay...

266
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:22,424
...Miss l'll-Never-Grow-My-Bangs-Out-
Because-lt'll-Make-My-Face-Too-Long.

267
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,400
l feel we should all be sitting
under dryers.

268
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:28,041
That's what happens
when best friends get together.

269
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:31,711
Wish we could have invited my best friend,
Roger Coleman...

270
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:34,814
...but he got hit
by a Goodwill truck last week.

271
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:36,976
Really?

272
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:43,479
Don't we have a commercial coming up?
Please.

273
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:47,089
-lt's so good to see you.
-lt's so good to see you. l--

274
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:49,821
Gracie, l'm sorry to interrupt.
We have another taping.

275
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:52,488
Oh, Cheryl, Joel Myers, my stylist.

276
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:56,660
Miss United States, such a joy to meet you.
This is my hair assistant, Janine.

277
00:20:56,837 --> 00:20:59,067
-A pleasure.
-And on makeup and bass guitar, Pam.

278
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,970
-Your Majesty.
-And you're having a bad crown day.

279
00:21:02,143 --> 00:21:04,441
Excuse me, private conversation
in progress.

280
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:07,074
-Ticktock.
-Okay.

281
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:10,045
l'm sorry l haven't called in a while.

282
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:13,846
Don't apologize. We'll have plenty of time
to talk once l'm de-queened.

283
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:18,685
-Oh, that sounds painful.
-Oh, l really miss you.

284
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:20,827
-And Eric.
-Oh, well...

285
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:23,361
...actually Eric and l
aren't Eric and l anymore.

286
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:28,332
-What? Since when?
-Oh, just 1 0 months.

287
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:31,471
-Ten months?
-Yeah, l didn't wanna bother you.

288
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:35,507
You're busy, l'm busy. l didn't wanna call
and say, ''We broke up.'' lt's no big deal.

289
00:21:35,676 --> 00:21:38,611
Miss Hart? My daughter
would love your John Hancock.

290
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:39,939
-What's her name?
-Lauren.

291
00:21:40,114 --> 00:21:41,172
Lauren.

292
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:43,349
So, what happened?

293
00:21:43,517 --> 00:21:47,681
Oh, l just had to end it because
he was getting, you know, really clingy.

294
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:52,515
Yeah, but l'm fine. l'm good. l'm great.

295
00:21:52,693 --> 00:21:55,491
We need to get to Live at 5
for a wrestling demonstration...

296
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:58,655
...then there's a cocktail party
at your publisher's apartment.

297
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,767
l could go for a little tanning time.

298
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:04,098
You're gonna go for a little unemployment
time in about two seconds.

299
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:06,796
Could you be a sweetheart
and get me a Starbucks?

300
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:09,704
l am dying for an iced
Venti Caramel Macchiato.

301
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:11,538
Get yourself a little something too.

302
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:17,083
Let me tell you when l'm gonna get you
an iced Venti Caramel Macchiato.

303
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:22,086
When they elect a black woman president of
the Daughters of the American Revolution.

304
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,026
Okay. And if that happens,
l'd also like one of those little muffins.

305
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:29,028
Where would you like it?

306
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:34,259
Fuller, l'm sensing a little subtle hostility,
and l think we should talk about it.

307
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:37,167
Fuller, you shouldn't keep things
bottled up.

308
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:41,775
-Fuller! What is your problem?
-The problem is, l don't like you.

309
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:45,139
Why don't you quit. l let you have this job
as a favor to McDonald...

310
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:48,372
...because no one outside of the canine unit
would work with you...

311
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:52,110
-...because of your little attitude problem.
-You know what? l'm out of here.

312
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:54,846
Wait. Are you still going to Starbucks?

313
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:10,561
Go!

314
00:23:17,878 --> 00:23:21,609
No one beats my little bro!
Let's go, let's go, pay up.

315
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:23,977
Come on, pay up.
Come on, who's next?

316
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:28,182
Let's get the bets on the table because--

317
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,952
-Yeah?
-ls he there?

318
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:37,522
-Yeah, he's here.
-Well, has he got my money?

319
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:39,559
Hold on, l'll ask.

320
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:47,237
Excuse me, Highlander, you owe
Mr. Grant 500 bucks. You got it?

321
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:49,171
Get lost.

322
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:52,277
He says he doesn't have it, Mr. Grant.

323
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:56,675
Okay! Okay!

324
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:59,217
He seems to have discovered
some cash, Mr. Grant.

325
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:02,583
Good. All right,
l got another one for you boys.

326
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:05,187
Who's the mark?

327
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,589
This is gonna be one for your scrapbook.

328
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,361
-Thank you very much. Your name, please?
-Octavia.

329
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:16,662
l was wondering if you could tell me
what skin-care regimen you use.

330
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:19,067
Well, l like to catch as many felons
as possible.

331
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,939
lt really gets the heart pumping, and the
increased circulation helps my complexion.

332
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:26,272
-There you go. Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

333
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:28,039
-Hey.
-Hey. Your name, please?

334
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:30,615
-Priscilla.
-Priscilla.

335
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:32,479
l have to do a book report.

336
00:24:32,653 --> 00:24:35,622
And l wanna do it on your book
because l wanna be an agent too.

337
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:38,690
Oh, well, good for you.
Thank you, Priscilla.

338
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:40,952
-Hi. Your name is?
-Angela.

339
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:44,757
The other kids are doing their report
on Beyonce or Britney...

340
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:48,868
...but if you come to my school and talk,
they'd see why being an agent is so cool...

341
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:51,630
-...and stop getting on me.
-l would really love to...

342
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:54,706
...but as you can see,
the agency's got me pretty busy.

343
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,103
There you go. Thank you.

344
00:24:56,277 --> 00:25:00,475
What you could do is pull your hair up once
in a while. lt would open up your face...

345
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:05,085
...because remember, people care about
people who care about themselves.

346
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:07,414
-Okay.
-Hi. Your name is?

347
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:08,816
-Jason.
-Jason.

348
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:13,585
lf you change your mind, it's P.S. 31 ,
Priscilla, Miss Gordan's class.

349
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:15,991
Got it. Thank you very much.
Your name, please?

350
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:17,562
-James.
-Wait!

351
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:19,528
You're not writing it down!

352
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,533
Bureau training. l can retain
enormous amounts of information.

353
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:26,639
P.S. 31 , Priscilla,
Miss Gordan's class. See?

354
00:25:27,675 --> 00:25:31,008
And don't forget the hair tip.
Try some bows.

355
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:36,945
-There you go. Thank you.
-Nice to meet you.

356
00:25:37,117 --> 00:25:40,211
And sorry to hear what happened
to Miss United States.

357
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,151
What happened?

358
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:49,262
Cheryl Frazier was last seen outside
this Las Vegas senior-citizen home...

359
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,297
...accompanied by longtime pageant host,
Stan Fields.

360
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:55,128
The two were walking to a limo
after a goodwill mission...

361
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:56,894
...visiting the residents here.

362
00:25:57,071 --> 00:26:01,201
Apparently, Miss United States
and emcee Fields were forced into a truck....

363
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:04,173
Are they hurt? Are they alive?
What demands have been made?

364
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:07,280
That's all we know. You'll find out more
when you get to Vegas.

365
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:09,814
The director wants you
to handle publicity on this.

366
00:26:09,984 --> 00:26:12,111
Public sees you on TV,
they'll feel reassured.

367
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:14,049
Absolutely, whatever l can do to help.

368
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:17,315
Get your beauty team assembled
immediately. The jet leaves at 0800.

369
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:20,892
l want you to have a bodyguard out
of New York. They're strapped in Vegas.

370
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:23,757
-Sir, why do l need a bodyguard?
-Crowd control.

371
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:26,695
You're gonna be
the hottest celebrity in Vegas.

372
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:30,997
-Assuming Wayne Newton isn't in town.
-Oh, of course, sir. ''Danke Schoen.''

373
00:26:36,577 --> 00:26:40,069
Fuller! l want you on a plane
to Vegas with Hart.

374
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:43,114
She's gonna do publicity
on the Cheryl Frazier kidnapping.

375
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:45,084
Not going.

376
00:26:47,454 --> 00:26:50,617
-Did you just refuse an order?
-l can't take her, sir.

377
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:53,123
l'll kill her. And l'll enjoy it.

378
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:55,990
Fuller, you are this close to being gone.

379
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,994
Nobody wants to work with you
in Chicago or here.

380
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,191
That's fine by me. l like to work alone.

381
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:05,600
Then become a lighthouse keeper.
This is the FBl. We like partners.

382
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:08,071
She's a pain in the ass.
She's conceited and--

383
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:12,679
Keep people off her. Keep her safe. You
be a good bodyguard, l'll find you a partner.

384
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:16,907
You blow this, you're gone. Period.

385
00:27:17,484 --> 00:27:20,078
And by the way,
l loved you both on Regis.

386
00:27:47,715 --> 00:27:48,943
-Grant.
-Boys.

387
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:50,344
Mr. Grant.

388
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:52,178
Let's see what you got for me.

389
00:27:52,353 --> 00:27:56,380
-Stan Fields and--
-Miss United States.

390
00:27:56,924 --> 00:28:00,223
You know what the pageant
will pay to get her back? Millions.

391
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:03,625
-So you're saying we hold her for ransom?
-No.

392
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:06,891
l hold her for ransom,
and you get a taste.

393
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:09,194
Bring her to my car.

394
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:14,400
l'm a little bit hungry.

395
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:17,005
Hey! We grabbed her.

396
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:20,613
Moron, you can't handle this job.
The feds will come right down on you.

397
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:25,411
Don't call me a moron. l got a BA
in Fine Arts, and my brother....

398
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:29,086
-Don't call me a moron.
-You were unemployed when l found you.

399
00:28:29,256 --> 00:28:31,622
You couldn't keep a job
on the show in the Strip.

400
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:34,317
l made that show! lt was my concept.

401
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:38,295
Then suddenly they change it and tell me
and Lou we're not up to their standards.

402
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:39,693
You work for me now.

403
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:43,832
-Lou.
-l'm there.

404
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,708
Bring me back up!

405
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:04,286
She's yours! She's all yours!
Let me up! Let me up.

406
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:08,253
Just let me up.
Oh, God, let me up.

407
00:29:09,363 --> 00:29:11,888
Next time, he lets go.

408
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,394
You guys are crazy!

409
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:23,133
Now what?

410
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,302
Now we do exactly what he said.
We ransom her.

411
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,696
Please be careful.
My guns are in that Fendi.

412
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,894
Thank you. Thank you.

413
00:29:58,645 --> 00:30:01,409
Please tell me you have tickets
to see Cirque du Soleil.

414
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:04,715
-l'm your bodyguard.
-What?

415
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:08,582
McDonald thinks we have a bond
because of our performance on Regis...

416
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:12,555
...and TRL, Oprah, the Food Network.

417
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:17,595
Oh, hey, hey, we got some great recipes
from that one. The lemon chicken? Tangy.

418
00:30:18,232 --> 00:30:23,465
Now, look, like all great teams,
Hope and Crosby, Fred and Ginger...

419
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:25,229
...Outkast...

420
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:27,202
...the end must come...

421
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:29,569
...so bye-bye.

422
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:37,409
Let me make this simple for you, Hart.
McDonald gave me a mission...

423
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:42,378
...so that plane does not take off
unless we're both on it. Got it?

424
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:45,657
You might consider a Tic Tac.

425
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:24,130
Please...

426
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:27,096
...we're trying to cooperate.

427
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:30,065
-Shut your mouth.
-You can't talk to her like that.

428
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:32,933
-You trying to tell me what to do?
-No, l'm just the emcee.

429
00:31:33,106 --> 00:31:36,769
l've heard you sing.
Lucky l don't shoot you now.

430
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:39,344
Okay, let's line this up.

431
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:45,550
-And....
-l don't have my crown.

432
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:48,416
-Who cares?
-l care.

433
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:49,886
-Fine.
-Thousands of women...

434
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:52,321
-...all across America care.
-Give her the crown.

435
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:56,929
When in public, Miss United States
always proudly wears her crown.

436
00:31:57,097 --> 00:31:58,826
Okay?

437
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,528
All right, let's go again.

438
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:06,372
One, two, action.

439
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,509
We've been kidnapped,
and there's two men here...

440
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:13,009
...who say they're gonna kill us
by Friday at midnight.

441
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,307
But l don't want anyone
to pay them any money.

442
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:18,417
-Cut!
-That would be giving in to terrorism...

443
00:32:18,585 --> 00:32:20,416
...and l'm Miss United States...

444
00:32:20,587 --> 00:32:23,886
-Cut!
-...and l stand for fairness and decency...

445
00:32:24,057 --> 00:32:25,888
...and the American way!

446
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:29,825
l said, cut!

447
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:35,701
l'd be happy to say it if you'd like.

448
00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:37,928
l've done quite a bit of theater.

449
00:32:38,105 --> 00:32:42,201
l played lago in Twelfth Night.

450
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:30,153
Put two more choppers up.

451
00:33:30,724 --> 00:33:32,055
Sir.

452
00:33:36,897 --> 00:33:39,559
-Gracie Hart.
-Yes.

453
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,563
-l'm Walter Collins.
-Sir.

454
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:45,264
l feel as though
l'm in the presence of royalty.

455
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,930
Oh, no, sir, l'm not queen,
just runner-up.

456
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:51,343
l would like to present to you
Agent Sam Fuller.

457
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:53,211
-Fuller.
-Sir.

458
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,215
-Joel Myers, Janine and Pam.
-Joel, Janine, Pam.

459
00:33:58,385 --> 00:34:02,185
Why don't we get you to the hotel
while l give the agents a debriefing.

460
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:06,287
Oh, that's too bad. lt's been months
since l've had a good debriefing.

461
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,759
Although, l'm really more
of a boxers man.

462
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:18,135
Okay, wrong audience.

463
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:26,974
Agent Hart, Agent Fuller,
this is Agent Foreman. He's your liaison.

464
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:29,138
-You need anything, Jeff is your boy.
-Good.

465
00:34:29,316 --> 00:34:30,749
Welcome to Las Vegas

466
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:34,751
When my girlfriend found out that l would
be working with you, she almost died.

467
00:34:34,921 --> 00:34:36,445
Yeah, she's an agent too.

468
00:34:36,623 --> 00:34:39,217
She actually thought
that l was gonna fall for you.

469
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:44,125
-l told her-- l said, ''Janet, there's no way--''
-Foreman, we talked about this.

470
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:49,530
Sorry, sir. Anyway, you're obviously
too old for me, so....

471
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:53,733
Oh, good, well, that's a load off.

472
00:34:55,242 --> 00:34:59,008
Frazier and Fields make an appearance
at a senior center for a program...

473
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:03,775
...where the elderly spend time with kids.
Mr. Fields' mother is there.

474
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,508
I think what you're doing here...

475
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:09,815
...shows that different generations
have so much to learn from each other.

476
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,756
I mean, I know I learned a lot
from my grandmother...

477
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:16,919
...specifically, how to kill a chicken.

478
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:21,090
And even though it wasn't something
I enjoyed doing...

479
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:24,203
...I'll never forget the sound
of their death squawks.

480
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:28,603
But if I had to kill a chicken,
I'd know how.

481
00:35:28,975 --> 00:35:30,408
They finish their appearance.

482
00:35:30,577 --> 00:35:33,205
Head for the limo,
where they're attacked and kidnapped.

483
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,644
We got this video
from a surveillance camera.

484
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:41,384
All we have is two hooded figures, the
make of the truck and a fake license plate.

485
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:46,219
We talked to the limo driver, but he says
he didn't see anything. And that's it.

486
00:35:46,493 --> 00:35:49,018
These are your briefing folders.

487
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:54,090
Hart, you have a press conference
at your hotel at 0900 tomorrow morning.

488
00:35:54,267 --> 00:35:56,235
-Call me if there's any questions.
-Sir?

489
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,928
-We have to find her.
-l'll find her.

490
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:17,418
l know we're on a tight schedule...

491
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:21,425
...but if you guys wanna see any shows,
just let me know. Janet can get us tickets.

492
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:24,155
l don't know how she does it,
but she does it.

493
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:29,194
She's really great.
Expert marksman. She bakes.

494
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:33,271
Oh, almost forgot.
Here are your coded lD cards.

495
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,672
You're gonna need these to get into
the Bureau. And here are your earpieces.

496
00:36:37,844 --> 00:36:39,402
We're-- Thanks.

497
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:43,106
We're gonna be on frequency 1 1 45.

498
00:36:44,084 --> 00:36:47,053
Sorry, that is not FBl issue.

499
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,950
That's a sweater that l bought for Janet
for her birthday.

500
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:54,787
And that's the hat that goes with it.
Argyle. She's Scottish.

501
00:36:55,161 --> 00:36:57,459
Janet McCarren.

502
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:00,259
Look, l'm sorry. l'm just really in love.

503
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,769
Where's the best place
for me to throw up?

504
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:05,766
Well, l am thrilled for you, Jeff.

505
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:10,838
Because, unlike Agent Fuller,
l, too, am carbon-based.

506
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,782
The Venetian Hotel.

507
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:35,166
Miss Hart!

508
00:37:37,637 --> 00:37:41,869
What a fantastic pleasure. l am Roberto
Fenice, manager of the Venetian Hotel.

509
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,739
-Oh, hello.
-Your wish is my command.

510
00:37:45,912 --> 00:37:49,541
Oh, well, l wish you wouldn't kiss
my watch. lt's not water-resistant.

511
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:52,913
Although it's more action
than l've had in months, so go ahead.

512
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:55,987
-Miss Hart, you are delicious.
-Mr. Fenice.

513
00:37:56,156 --> 00:37:58,647
Hi, l'm Agent Foreman.
This is Agent Sam Fuller.

514
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:03,159
-Oh, my gosh! lt's Gracie Hart!
-You're kidding!

515
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,661
-Where?
-Right there!

516
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:06,423
Gracie!

517
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,567
Gracie! Hey! Grac--

518
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:10,191
Fuller!

519
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:12,929
-Oh, my!
-Fuller!

520
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,269
All right, down! Down!

521
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,535
Too much, too much, too much.
Fuller, Fuller.

522
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:22,614
Fuller, l don't think you fully understand
the concept of ''too much'' !

523
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:26,411
Hey, McDonald told me
to keep people off you.

524
00:38:26,586 --> 00:38:31,182
And l don't think grandpa's coming back.
At least, not under his own power.

525
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:38,488
Maybe we should've stayed
at Treasure lsland, huh?

526
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,293
-You don't see that in Jersey.
-lt's the best.

527
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:45,529
A ships sinks, and there's all
these scantily clad sailors around.

528
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:49,266
-Makes me wanna join the Navy.
-Yeah, you are just what they're looking for.

529
00:38:49,442 --> 00:38:52,309
Hey, Hart, you sure this suite
is big enough for you?

530
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:55,471
l can fit my entire room
inside your steam shower.

531
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:57,548
Feel free to move in there.

532
00:38:57,717 --> 00:39:00,948
Yeah, right. Right, let's go over
this schedule for tomorrow.

533
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,679
-Gracie?
-Yes.

534
00:39:02,856 --> 00:39:05,757
Gracie, there's something
about Cheryl on the TV.

535
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:11,529
We just received what appears to be
a ransom video...

536
00:39:11,698 --> 00:39:15,862
...which was e-mailed to our studios
a few hours ago from an anonymous source.

537
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:19,130
It was sent from an unknown location.

538
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:22,900
We've been kidnapped.
And there's two men here...

539
00:39:23,076 --> 00:39:27,308
...who say they're going to kill us
by Friday at midnight...

540
00:39:27,714 --> 00:39:32,083
...unless they're paid $5 million
by the pageant.

541
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:37,550
Once again, that's $5 million
by Friday at midnight.

542
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:40,887
l can't just sit here. l have to do something.
l should just see--

543
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:43,757
You should do exactly
what you came here to do, Hart.

544
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:47,232
Press conference at 9.

545
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:44,314
Limos.

546
00:40:44,724 --> 00:40:47,488
Limos, limos, limos.

547
00:41:07,747 --> 00:41:11,615
-Call for you, sir. Line two.
-Thank you.

548
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:18,316
-Collins.
-Yes, sir, hi, this is Gracie Hart.

549
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:21,426
l was looking at the visuals,
and l noticed that the limousine--

550
00:41:21,594 --> 00:41:24,085
-We talked to the limo driver.
-l realize that, but--

551
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:26,732
-We've got something on aerial.
-Don't worry about it.

552
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,891
Get some rest.
Have a nice press conference.

553
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:32,571
Okay.

554
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,471
Thank you, Janet.

555
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:41,947
Yeah, hi, is this Desert Limo Service?

556
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:44,743
Yeah, l'm trying to locate
one of your drivers.

557
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:46,749
A Mr. Tom Abernathy.

558
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:13,239
Hi, is Gracie Hart there, please?
l have FBl Director Wilson on the line.

559
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:15,313
We need to speak with her ASAP, please.

560
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:20,082
ls Gracie Hart here? Gracie Hart?

561
00:42:20,253 --> 00:42:24,383
-ls somebody calling for Gracie Hart?
-Yes, ma'am.

562
00:42:24,557 --> 00:42:26,718
l'm Gracie Hart.

563
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,155
-l recognize her! Gracie Hart's here!
-Yes?

564
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:34,528
-lt's FBl Director Wilson, ASAP. ASAP.
-Director Wilson. Thank you. Hart here.

565
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:37,433
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

566
00:42:38,371 --> 00:42:40,100
Yes, sir. l'm on it.

567
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:43,240
Thank you very much.
Okay, sir, bye-bye.

568
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:45,604
-Would you please sign this?
-Oh, sure, l--

569
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:47,803
My mom loves you.

570
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:50,973
-And she does not love easily.
-l love you too, Gracie.

571
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,084
-You're fabulous.
-You've got such great--

572
00:42:53,253 --> 00:42:56,745
Thank you, guys, so much
for your support.

573
00:42:56,923 --> 00:43:01,622
l'm here on business to talk to this man
about the Miss United States kidnapping.

574
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:03,318
-Mr. Abernathy?
-Yeah?

575
00:43:03,496 --> 00:43:05,327
What did you do?

576
00:43:05,498 --> 00:43:09,525
He was driving the limousine
that Cheryl Frazier and Stan Fields were in...

577
00:43:09,702 --> 00:43:11,192
...the day they were kidnapped.

578
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:14,966
l wanted to know why you parked so far
away from the entrance of the home.

579
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:17,166
Yeah, why would you do that? Why?

580
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:20,141
So if l could show you something....

581
00:43:20,313 --> 00:43:26,081
Well, it's not these. lt's not my badge.
Well, what do you--?

582
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,481
lt's my deployment schedule...

583
00:43:29,656 --> 00:43:34,184
...and if you can look where it says
''tomorrow's events.''

584
00:43:34,627 --> 00:43:38,119
-Yeah, go ahead, read aloud.
-''Nine a.m. press conference...

585
00:43:38,298 --> 00:43:42,496
-...at the Venetian''?
-Speak up, we cannot hear you!

586
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:45,331
He said, ''9 a.m. press conference
at the Venetian'' ...

587
00:43:45,505 --> 00:43:48,030
...where l will be in front
of channels two, four--

588
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:50,107
l mean, well, everybody's invited.

589
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:53,768
And l will probably have to say
that Tom Abernathy is a suspect.

590
00:43:53,946 --> 00:43:56,141
Why are you doing this to me?

591
00:43:56,316 --> 00:43:58,216
Because l wanna find my friends.

592
00:43:58,518 --> 00:44:01,612
And because you are sweating
in all three stress spots...

593
00:44:01,788 --> 00:44:06,748
...that people routinely start sweating in
before they undergo public humiliation.

594
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,091
l had it on Letterman.

595
00:44:10,129 --> 00:44:12,597
Okay, everybody,
l would love to stay and chat...

596
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:15,791
...but l have to go pick out my outfit
for the press conference.

597
00:44:15,968 --> 00:44:18,368
-Oh, what time was that again?
-Nine!

598
00:44:18,538 --> 00:44:21,871
Thank you. Watch the news,
l'll do a little shout out.

599
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,474
Thanks, Gracie.

600
00:44:23,643 --> 00:44:28,410
Hey! Hey! Hold up! Hold up. Wait.

601
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:34,952
Okay. Somebody came up to me
the day before.

602
00:44:35,121 --> 00:44:39,455
She offers me 200 bucks if l will park
far away from the entrance at the home...

603
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:43,891
-...and that's it. That's all l know, l swear.
-She? What did she look like?

604
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:52,671
-Oh, Miss Hart, would you mind?
-Oh, l'm actually in a hurry.

605
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:55,501
-ls it true you're seeing Prince William?
-Oh, l'm--

606
00:44:55,675 --> 00:44:59,577
No, we were just talking at a book party.
He's in love with me, but l hate castles.

607
00:45:00,113 --> 00:45:04,573
-Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hey.
-Let me explain something to you.

608
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:08,084
You didn't do what was on the schedule,
and l'm a schedule-type person.

609
00:45:08,254 --> 00:45:10,119
You missed the press conference.

610
00:45:10,289 --> 00:45:13,258
l went to the Bureau because
l got a tip from the limo driver...

611
00:45:13,426 --> 00:45:16,020
...who said that somebody
who looked like Dolly Parton...

612
00:45:16,195 --> 00:45:18,595
...paid him not to park
in front of the senior home.

613
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:20,665
-Did you hear what you just said?
-Yeah.

614
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:23,165
And why did you go out
without clearing it with me?

615
00:45:23,336 --> 00:45:25,930
Clearing it with you?

616
00:45:26,305 --> 00:45:28,239
Hey, l'll bet no one's had breakfast--

617
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:31,707
l'm sorry, but l don't work for you.
Okay? You work for me, so--

618
00:45:31,878 --> 00:45:36,008
-No, you didn't just say l work for you.
-You work for me.

619
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:38,173
-You work for me.
-Shut up.

620
00:45:38,351 --> 00:45:39,682
-You work for me.
-Shut up.

621
00:45:39,852 --> 00:45:42,616
Fuller, l don't have the time
for this, okay?

622
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:44,882
Listen, why don't we just get something--

623
00:45:45,057 --> 00:45:47,821
Okay, look. l am the face of the Bureau.

624
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:52,556
You are here to help me be the face of the
Bureau, which means that you work for me.

625
00:45:52,732 --> 00:45:53,960
lt's no big--

626
00:45:56,969 --> 00:46:01,565
Look, Hart, l am your bodyguard.
That means l need a body to guard!

627
00:46:01,974 --> 00:46:06,502
You hit me, which means
l could bring you up on charges.

628
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:10,809
lf l could just bring myself up
right now.

629
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,414
Okay, look, l don't work for you.
You don't work for me.

630
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:20,719
We're a team. Get it? As in ''l will kick your
sorry ass if you don't listen to me'' team.

631
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:23,157
lf you remember correctly,
it was ''skinny ass.''

632
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:26,594
And, second of all,
what is your problem, Fuller?

633
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:31,563
Do you honestly feel it's okay to go around
harassing people and bashing their faces in?

634
00:46:31,737 --> 00:46:34,331
Guess what.
You will never make it in this Bureau...

635
00:46:34,507 --> 00:46:37,533
...if you don't start using your head.
You just use--

636
00:46:38,678 --> 00:46:40,942
What, you start listening to me now?

637
00:46:43,216 --> 00:46:45,776
Stop it! Stop! Stop!

638
00:46:46,385 --> 00:46:47,613
All right.

639
00:46:47,787 --> 00:46:53,419
Fuller, violence is not the answer
to our problems, all right? lt's not.

640
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:56,653
And l'm not just saying that
because l'm ''scared'' of you. Okay?

641
00:46:56,829 --> 00:46:59,389
Because l'm-- What is that?!

642
00:47:04,136 --> 00:47:07,537
l am calling McDonald. Where's Joel?
l can't go into public like this.

643
00:47:07,707 --> 00:47:09,402
Hey, how are you? Joel!

644
00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:12,135
-Hello.
-You knocked my highlights off.

645
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:13,710
-What happened?
-Look!

646
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,905
-This will take an hour.
-Tell me about it.

647
00:47:16,082 --> 00:47:17,344
-Misting.
-Ladies.

648
00:47:17,517 --> 00:47:21,146
l really think we should call the networks
and set up another press conference.

649
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,845
You know what?
You're absolutely right. Okay.

650
00:47:24,023 --> 00:47:28,585
l'm gonna go back up to the room.
l'm gonna get a little spritz, a little refresh--

651
00:47:32,131 --> 00:47:36,158
lt's her. lt's her. Hold this.

652
00:47:37,136 --> 00:47:40,264
-We are not questioning Dolly.
-lt's not the real Dolly, so relax.

653
00:47:40,439 --> 00:47:42,600
l know it's not. Stay away from her.

654
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:44,743
Okay, l'm an adult.
l can act as l please.

655
00:47:44,911 --> 00:47:47,744
-You leave Dolly alone!
-Get your hands off me!

656
00:47:47,914 --> 00:47:52,146
Thank you very much.
Excuse me, fake Dolly!

657
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:54,411
Hi. Hello. FBl here.

658
00:47:54,587 --> 00:47:58,250
Yeah, l just would love to have
a few words with you if l could.

659
00:47:58,424 --> 00:48:00,016
-Hi, how are you?
-How you doing?

660
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:04,492
Yeah, thank you for your support.
Yeah. Get off me, you stalker! Get off me!

661
00:48:05,164 --> 00:48:06,597
Fake Dolly!

662
00:48:06,766 --> 00:48:08,427
Where are you going?

663
00:48:11,003 --> 00:48:12,231
Hart!

664
00:48:14,373 --> 00:48:15,670
-Fake Dolly!
-Gracie!

665
00:48:15,841 --> 00:48:17,172
-Stop!
-Hart, stop!

666
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:20,009
Dolly Parton!

667
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:23,979
What is it about this outfit that is making
everyone so uncooperative?

668
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,447
Gracie Hart!

669
00:48:29,188 --> 00:48:32,351
Blondie! No pictures. Hold on.

670
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:33,890
Excuse me. l need for you to--

671
00:48:35,328 --> 00:48:37,990
-Open! Just--
-Watch it!

672
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:41,565
-Someone stop that fake Dolly!
-Hart, stop!

673
00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:44,866
Stop her!

674
00:48:45,304 --> 00:48:46,532
Excuse me. Excuse me.

675
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:53,403
Please don't make me do something
that's not ladylike.

676
00:48:59,151 --> 00:49:01,984
Okay, FBl. l have just a few questions
for you.

677
00:49:02,154 --> 00:49:05,715
Me first! What is the matter with you?

678
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:07,825
Miss Hart! What are you doing?

679
00:49:07,994 --> 00:49:11,395
Miss Parton is here for a press conference
to announce her new world tour.

680
00:49:11,564 --> 00:49:14,192
There is no world tour,
and this is not Dolly Parton.

681
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:17,200
Okay, look. Look, these are absolutely--

682
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:20,806
What are you--? What is she doing?
That hurts!

683
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,274
-Why did you run?
-Some crazy woman was chasing me!

684
00:49:26,012 --> 00:49:30,039
Excuse me, excuse me. Miss Parton, ''Here
You Come Again'' was my wedding song.

685
00:49:30,216 --> 00:49:32,776
-l just love you.
-Honey, let's leave Miss Parton alone.

686
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:35,750
l love that song too.
That was an amazing song!

687
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:38,048
Why are you on top of me?

688
00:49:39,558 --> 00:49:42,186
l'm just a big fan.

689
00:49:42,928 --> 00:49:45,123
lt's also on CNN...

690
00:49:45,297 --> 00:49:47,697
...MSNBC...

691
00:49:48,034 --> 00:49:50,161
...and Al Jazeera.

692
00:49:50,336 --> 00:49:54,397
-l was trying to question her regarding--
-You really think you're something special.

693
00:49:54,573 --> 00:49:57,406
l have got 75 people
working on this case day and night...

694
00:49:57,576 --> 00:50:00,477
-...and they don't stack up to you, do they?
-The limo driver--

695
00:50:00,646 --> 00:50:03,740
l want you off this case.

696
00:50:04,116 --> 00:50:09,554
Well, l am sorry, sir, but you don't have
the authority to kick me off this case.

697
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,850
l could call the director,
who happens to be a close, personal friend.

698
00:50:16,028 --> 00:50:21,762
Or l could even call the president,
who invited me to dinner at his house.

699
00:50:22,134 --> 00:50:26,969
And l think we know which house
l'm talking about, don't we? lt's white.

700
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:28,697
Actually, it's eggshell, if you--

701
00:50:28,874 --> 00:50:33,334
l am the SAC in Las Vegas.
l have authority over my territory.

702
00:50:33,512 --> 00:50:36,413
And when the director sees you
on national television...

703
00:50:36,582 --> 00:50:40,416
...nose-tackling his favorite country-western
singer, he will back me up.

704
00:50:40,753 --> 00:50:44,189
Now, l want the two of you
on a jet back to New York today.

705
00:50:44,356 --> 00:50:47,951
Do you think you can handle
that tiny, little task, Foreman?

706
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,488
Of course, sir.

707
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:57,893
Okay. l got you the last three seats
on the flight.

708
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,470
Janine, Pam, you have to take
the next one. Sorry.

709
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,707
-Because we're just hair and makeup?
-We could go to the bar.

710
00:51:03,876 --> 00:51:06,344
For five hours?

711
00:51:06,512 --> 00:51:08,002
Okay.

712
00:51:13,786 --> 00:51:16,277
The director's gonna call me back
any minute.

713
00:51:16,455 --> 00:51:17,786
Good. And when he does...

714
00:51:17,957 --> 00:51:21,358
...you can let him know that chasing Dolly
was all your dumb idea.

715
00:51:21,527 --> 00:51:24,724
Oh, really? Well, let me ask you something,
Chatty Cathy.

716
00:51:24,897 --> 00:51:28,492
What happened to, ''Team, yo.
You and me in it together''?

717
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:32,103
Don't do that again.
And that was before you ruined my career.

718
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:33,499
-What?
-Yeah.

719
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:37,938
McDonald said that if l screwed this up,
then l'm out of the Bureau. Thanks, Hart.

720
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:40,442
What are you complaining about?
You're not famous.

721
00:51:40,613 --> 00:51:43,138
Nobody knows who you are.
You're a private failure.

722
00:51:43,315 --> 00:51:46,842
But you see this? You see this?
Everybody knows this.

723
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:49,419
So if l screw up, l'm failure face.

724
00:51:49,588 --> 00:51:52,386
Well, get your failure face
out of my ruined-career face...

725
00:51:52,558 --> 00:51:55,857
...because right now l'm mad,
and l'm pissed off and mad, so--

726
00:51:56,028 --> 00:51:58,189
Oh, okay, hold on.
So you're double mad?

727
00:51:58,364 --> 00:52:02,232
Well, if you're double mad, then l am
mad, mad, mad. All right? Top that one.

728
00:52:02,401 --> 00:52:04,335
-Back off!
-You gotta stop hitting me...

729
00:52:04,503 --> 00:52:06,437
...because every time you do,
it wrinkles!

730
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:08,573
Ladies, ladies!

731
00:52:08,741 --> 00:52:13,474
Calm down. Sit down. Sit down.
l'm gonna separate the two of you.

732
00:52:13,813 --> 00:52:16,179
Mad, mad, mad, mad. Four.

733
00:52:17,216 --> 00:52:18,683
l can still shoot her from here.

734
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:20,614
You have to lean over me
to get to her.

735
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:24,916
Now, let's calm down and try to focus
on the positive. We have our health.

736
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:28,526
-You'll be getting frequent-flyer miles.
-Foreman, what did you just say?

737
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:31,557
Frequent-flyer miles.
lt's a great way to get upgrades.

738
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,357
No, you said that she--

739
00:52:36,368 --> 00:52:40,998
You said that she would have
to lean over you to get to me.

740
00:52:44,543 --> 00:52:47,512
Look at what the kidnappers are doing.

741
00:52:48,414 --> 00:52:51,611
This guy is leaning over Cheryl
to get to Stan.

742
00:52:51,784 --> 00:52:54,844
Why would they do that
if they were after Cheryl?

743
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,647
Okay, and look at this. Look at this.
They're not even touching her.

744
00:52:58,824 --> 00:53:03,557
No, she's just stuck in there,
like a little Cheryl sandwich. She's-- She's--

745
00:53:03,729 --> 00:53:08,132
Oh, my God. She is grabbing them.
l taught her that wristlock.

746
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,930
-She's not defending herself. She's--
-She's defending Stan.

747
00:53:13,105 --> 00:53:17,007
Maybe they weren't after Cheryl.
Maybe they were after Stan.

748
00:53:17,877 --> 00:53:19,811
The man can't sing,
but is that a crime?

749
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:22,914
-That's what we're gonna find out.
-Hey, look, they're boarding.

750
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:24,947
-Let it go, Hart.
-Oh, Fuller, come on.

751
00:53:25,117 --> 00:53:28,814
Wake up and smell the iced Venti Caramel
Macchiato. You know l'm onto something.

752
00:53:28,988 --> 00:53:32,321
-Okay. Tell Collins.
-We have issues. He won't listen to me.

753
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:35,892
-And you think l am?
-Yes. Yes, l do.

754
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:40,691
You know, you don't get your miles unless
you're actually on the flight, so come on.

755
00:53:41,267 --> 00:53:43,599
-You're on your own, Hart.
-No, l'm not.

756
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:47,603
Because even though you refuse to dress up
or separate those eyebrows...

757
00:53:47,773 --> 00:53:49,832
...you cannot deny that you have a style.

758
00:53:50,576 --> 00:53:56,208
Gray suit, white shirt, masculine shoes.
You are an FBl agent.

759
00:53:56,382 --> 00:53:58,350
And that is all that you have.

760
00:53:58,517 --> 00:54:03,955
And like you said, if you go back there now,
you are out of the Bureau.

761
00:54:04,123 --> 00:54:08,355
Now boarding all rows
on flight 624 to New York.

762
00:54:09,995 --> 00:54:11,519
Fuller, l am begging you.

763
00:54:12,064 --> 00:54:15,033
Do you have any idea
how painful this is for me?

764
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,260
Usually, they give an epidural
for this kind of agony.

765
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:23,932
Fuller, please, just.... Just, please.

766
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,575
Hart, you better be right, or l swear--

767
00:54:30,749 --> 00:54:34,185
You're gonna kick my skinny white ass
and break my face. l know.

768
00:54:34,954 --> 00:54:39,721
l already paid for the seats, and l don't
get reimbursed unless you're on the flight.

769
00:54:46,298 --> 00:54:49,426
l'm letting you spend the night
because l wanna keep my eyes on you.

770
00:54:49,601 --> 00:54:53,002
-Tomorrow, you guys are on a flight.
-Okay, as soon as we go to the home.

771
00:54:53,172 --> 00:54:55,265
-Whose home?
-Where Stan Fields' mother lives.

772
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:58,274
She was the last person to see him.
Maybe she knows something.

773
00:54:58,444 --> 00:55:02,540
You're supposed to be in New York. You're
famous. Everyone there will recognize you.

774
00:55:02,715 --> 00:55:06,207
Not to worry. Joel will come up
with something to make us blend.

775
00:55:06,385 --> 00:55:09,513
-He's a born blender.
-l don't believe this.

776
00:55:10,556 --> 00:55:12,820
You guys are lucky
that Janet had to work late...

777
00:55:12,992 --> 00:55:16,587
...because if she was here,
she would not put up with any of this.

778
00:55:17,262 --> 00:55:20,561
Now, Janet-- Janet runs a tight ship.

779
00:55:23,168 --> 00:55:28,800
l love shopping in Vegas. Where else can
you find a 24-hour wiggery? Well, to work.

780
00:55:31,243 --> 00:55:33,336
Hey, hey! That's my room! Hey!

781
00:55:33,779 --> 00:55:34,768
Hey!

782
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:46,455
-l never would have suspected.
-What?

783
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:49,685
You as a dainty-travel-pillow type.

784
00:55:49,862 --> 00:55:52,422
-lt's hypoallergenic.
-Oh, really?

785
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:55,863
-And what are you allergic to?
-Besides you?

786
00:55:56,035 --> 00:56:01,098
Shellfish, cats, dogs,
any type of animal dander...

787
00:56:01,273 --> 00:56:02,831
...dairy products, dust--

788
00:56:03,008 --> 00:56:06,466
-You should be in a plastic bubble.
-Plastic.

789
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:10,615
-That explains it.
-Explains what?

790
00:56:10,783 --> 00:56:13,650
-Why you're so angry.
-l'm not angry, l'm allergic.

791
00:56:13,819 --> 00:56:16,219
All l was saying was that it just,
you know...

792
00:56:16,388 --> 00:56:20,324
...couldn't have been easy
being a kid sick like that all the time.

793
00:56:20,926 --> 00:56:27,092
l mean, not being able to have a dog
or a cat or ice cream or dust.

794
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,434
lt wasn't bad.

795
00:56:30,602 --> 00:56:34,368
-Really?
-l got to hang out with my dad a lot.

796
00:56:35,107 --> 00:56:40,670
He was a sportswriter, so we got to watch
all the games on TV together...

797
00:56:40,846 --> 00:56:43,178
...and he taught me how to box.

798
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:46,143
Taught me how to take care of myself.

799
00:56:50,089 --> 00:56:53,889
Well, l'm sure he was very proud of you.

800
00:56:55,461 --> 00:56:57,190
Was?

801
00:57:00,766 --> 00:57:04,293
Yeah, l read on your file that he died
before you became an agent.

802
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:08,372
-You read my file?
-l had to make sure you weren't crazy.

803
00:57:08,841 --> 00:57:13,801
-Yeah. Turns out you can't trust a file.
-Yeah, well, l guess you can't.

804
00:57:13,979 --> 00:57:18,382
l thought l would've liked a tough tomboy
from Jersey whose mom was an agent.

805
00:57:18,717 --> 00:57:21,686
-You read my file?
-Worse.

806
00:57:21,854 --> 00:57:23,082
Your book.

807
00:57:24,456 --> 00:57:26,515
Had to make sure you weren't crazy.

808
00:57:26,692 --> 00:57:30,093
Turns out you can't trust a book.

809
00:57:33,765 --> 00:57:36,199
Yeah, they brought in this writer...

810
00:57:36,668 --> 00:57:40,729
...who managed to turn the entire story
into some fairy tale.

811
00:57:40,906 --> 00:57:43,807
ln the first draft, he made it sound like
my mother died...

812
00:57:43,976 --> 00:57:48,345
...single-handedly saving the country,
when all it was was just, you know, a--

813
00:57:48,514 --> 00:57:51,506
lt was just a drug bust gone bad.

814
00:57:55,487 --> 00:57:56,749
Sorry.

815
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,583
Sorry about your dad.

816
00:58:04,329 --> 00:58:07,264
But l'm mostly sorry
you had to read that book.

817
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:10,733
l like the pictures, though.

818
00:58:11,336 --> 00:58:13,099
Oh, really?

819
00:58:13,272 --> 00:58:17,038
Yeah, especially that one with that guy.
What was his name?

820
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:19,270
Which one?

821
00:58:19,444 --> 00:58:22,936
The agent, the one
that was in the pageant with you.

822
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:26,885
Eric Matthews.

823
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,917
Yeah. He was hot.

824
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:33,418
l guess.

825
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:37,288
Night, Hart.

826
00:58:40,265 --> 00:58:42,096
Good night, Fuller.

827
00:58:47,869 --> 00:58:51,396
Foreman, we're in. Approaching target.

828
00:58:57,846 --> 00:59:00,815
Welcome to Prestige Assisted Living.
How can l help you?

829
00:59:00,982 --> 00:59:03,280
Hi, l'm Joel Flammenbaum,
and this is my mother.

830
00:59:03,451 --> 00:59:07,945
lda. lda Flammenbaum. How are you?
This is my lovely nurse, Rosie.

831
00:59:08,123 --> 00:59:09,750
-Hello.
-She's not very social...

832
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:14,294
...but she gives a superb enema
if you're feeling a little clogged up.

833
00:59:15,163 --> 00:59:17,256
Are you interested
in touring our facilities?

834
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:20,401
Oh, yes, we are very interested.
l can't wait to get rid of her.

835
00:59:20,569 --> 00:59:25,802
Oh, don't you listen to him. He's a mama's
boy. Come here, cutie. Let me fix your tie.

836
00:59:25,974 --> 00:59:27,805
-He's such a mama's boy.
-Mom, not now.

837
00:59:27,976 --> 00:59:31,776
Now, that is a mama's boy's face.
That's a mama's boy's face.

838
00:59:32,214 --> 00:59:34,648
Do you have a euthanasia program?

839
00:59:35,217 --> 00:59:39,051
We just need to fill out some forms.
lf you'll just give me one minute.

840
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:40,682
Keep the receptionist busy.

841
00:59:40,856 --> 00:59:44,314
We're gonna ask some questions,
assuming we can find anyone that can hear.

842
00:59:44,492 --> 00:59:47,359
Hold my purse. Let's roll, Rosie.

843
00:59:48,096 --> 00:59:51,827
Hello there. I'm Ida Flammenbaum.
I am new.

844
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,195
Well, l'm not new.

845
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:56,735
-And you are?
-Buster Harrison.

846
00:59:56,905 --> 01:00:02,810
Oh, Buster. ls it true that Stan Fields'
mother is residing here?

847
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:05,776
Yes, she's right over there.

848
01:00:06,882 --> 01:00:10,978
Carol? This is lda.
She wanted to meet you.

849
01:00:12,354 --> 01:00:18,452
Oh, Buster. Oh, Buster, l'm so sorry. Give
Buster one of your famous foot massages.

850
01:00:18,627 --> 01:00:22,495
Hey. While l'm at it, how about one
of my famous enemas?

851
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:24,598
Can you get two of them in a day?

852
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:27,929
Mrs. Fields, Mrs. Fields.

853
01:00:28,336 --> 01:00:30,702
Sounds like the cookie. lt's very funny.

854
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:33,568
Not after you've heard it
for 30 years, lda.

855
01:00:33,742 --> 01:00:35,972
l'm sure. l just wanted
to come over here...

856
01:00:36,144 --> 01:00:39,978
...and tell you how very sorry l am
about the kidnapping.

857
01:00:40,148 --> 01:00:43,515
Oh, yeah, poor, poor Stanley.

858
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:46,013
But he had it coming.

859
01:00:47,222 --> 01:00:48,689
Really?

860
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:52,918
Well, from what l hear from everyone,
he's such a mensch.

861
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:58,327
-l mean, who would wanna hurt him?
-Well, you know, he loved the sluts.

862
01:01:01,202 --> 01:01:03,067
He loved the sluts?

863
01:01:03,238 --> 01:01:05,502
-The sluts!
-The sluts.

864
01:01:05,674 --> 01:01:09,542
-The slut machines.
-Slot machines.

865
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:13,579
When he wasn't doing that pageant,
he was here in Vegas, gambling.

866
01:01:13,748 --> 01:01:15,579
l don't know where he gets that from.

867
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:20,312
So you were saying-- You were saying
that your son, he loves the slot machines.

868
01:01:20,488 --> 01:01:22,820
l begged him to stop. l said to him:

869
01:01:22,991 --> 01:01:26,051
''One of these days, gambling's
gonna get you in a lot of trouble.''

870
01:01:26,227 --> 01:01:28,752
l lent him 600 bucks,
l never got it back.

871
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:32,093
l was ready to break his legs,
and l'm his mother.

872
01:01:32,267 --> 01:01:34,258
Wait till the loan sharks
get ahold of him.

873
01:01:34,436 --> 01:01:38,270
The loan sharks every time will get you.
They're very--

874
01:01:42,544 --> 01:01:44,375
Loan shark.

875
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:49,241
-lt's the loan sharks.
-lda, you can walk!

876
01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:52,181
-Praise Jesus!
-Moses.

877
01:01:52,354 --> 01:01:55,653
Moses, l am walking again.
Sign me up for this place.

878
01:01:55,824 --> 01:01:58,349
l love it here, and the men
make me all fakakta.

879
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,364
Jeff, why are we here?

880
01:02:04,532 --> 01:02:06,727
-Because we had a deal, Gracie.
-Okay, look.

881
01:02:06,901 --> 01:02:10,701
Deals are like pearls. They're lovely,
but they fall apart all the time.

882
01:02:10,872 --> 01:02:13,340
l'm grabbing your luggage.
We're going to the airport.

883
01:02:13,508 --> 01:02:15,567
Didn't you hear
what Stan's mother said?

884
01:02:15,744 --> 01:02:18,212
Yes, l did. ''Sluts.''
l wrote it down, all right?

885
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,178
''Loan shark.'' That's why
we have to get back to the Bureau...

886
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:23,613
...do a CHC printout
of every loan shark in Vegas.

887
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:26,982
You can't go to the Bureau.
You are supposed to be in New York.

888
01:02:27,155 --> 01:02:29,817
And that is why you can go
and you can take--

889
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:32,186
-No! No!
-Okay, look, Jeff...

890
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,126
...l don't like to use my gun unless it's
in self-defense or at a really good sale...

891
01:02:36,297 --> 01:02:39,596
...but if you don't go back
and get those CHCs, l have to--

892
01:02:39,768 --> 01:02:41,292
You know, l have to shoot you.

893
01:02:41,703 --> 01:02:44,069
You won't do it, Gracie.

894
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:49,602
This is what l like.
Learning to work together.

895
01:02:49,778 --> 01:02:52,008
A little ''Ebony & lvory'' action.

896
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,411
-Guys, l can't do it.
-Stop being a wuss, Foreman. Be a man!

897
01:02:56,584 --> 01:02:58,051
Yeah, like Fuller.

898
01:02:58,219 --> 01:03:01,950
Okay. But this is it. Then we're going
to the airport. Enough's enough.

899
01:03:02,123 --> 01:03:04,216
-Absolutely. Okay.
-l'm putting my foot down.

900
01:03:04,392 --> 01:03:06,451
He's putting his foot down.

901
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:22,306
Got some high-def tapes for the new
ransom video. More production value.

902
01:03:22,477 --> 01:03:24,138
Bro...

903
01:03:24,446 --> 01:03:26,573
...maybe we should get out now.

904
01:03:26,748 --> 01:03:30,184
Are you kidding? We got them where
we want them. They're getting nervous.

905
01:03:30,351 --> 01:03:32,444
But if they don't agree
to our demands, we--

906
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:34,212
That's why we're making a new one.

907
01:03:34,389 --> 01:03:37,654
We're gonna have Miss United States say
we're moving up the deadline.

908
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:41,990
And either we get our cash wired to an
offshore account tonight, or she's dead.

909
01:03:42,163 --> 01:03:44,961
So, what do we do? Shoot them?

910
01:03:45,133 --> 01:03:50,332
No. We're gonna kill them
and get a little payback at the hotel.

911
01:03:50,505 --> 01:03:53,497
You know how location
is everything in Vegas, right?

912
01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:57,839
Well, after we pull this off, Treasure
lsland's gonna be a big, ugly crime site.

913
01:03:58,279 --> 01:04:01,043
-What, are we just gonna drive in?
-No.

914
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:04,652
Just before the show starts, we'll tie
them up at the bottom of the boat.

915
01:04:04,819 --> 01:04:08,152
That ship sinks,
so long, Miss United States.

916
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:19,760
-Hey, guys.
-Foreman.

917
01:04:19,934 --> 01:04:21,196
Nice job with Dolly Parton.

918
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:25,806
Yeah. We've been after Dolly for a long
time, but it took you to finally bring her in.

919
01:04:29,577 --> 01:04:32,045
-l can't do this.
-Yes, you can.

920
01:04:32,213 --> 01:04:35,705
Remember what Louis Vuitton said,
''lt's in the bag.'' You can do this.

921
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:37,679
Okay.

922
01:04:37,852 --> 01:04:39,080
He can't do this.

923
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:43,020
Going down like a fat woman
on a greased fire pole.

924
01:04:43,558 --> 01:04:45,549
l heard that.

925
01:04:58,907 --> 01:05:00,204
l'm going into the database.

926
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:03,776
-Great. Just keep us filled in.
-Okay.

927
01:05:04,379 --> 01:05:07,348
Someone left a can of soda
by the keyboard.

928
01:05:07,515 --> 01:05:08,846
l'm sweating profusely.

929
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:12,219
I think I left my oven on.

930
01:05:15,156 --> 01:05:18,353
-We're printing.
-Awesome, Jeff. Awesome. You did it.

931
01:05:18,526 --> 01:05:21,893
-Fuller just lost a bet.
-Not over yet.

932
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:25,358
-Agent Collins, if you could just answer a--
-Agent Collins!

933
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:28,661
All right, this is gonna be
the last question. Yes, go ahead.

934
01:05:28,836 --> 01:05:31,270
What happens if tomorrow's deadline
comes and goes...

935
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:33,134
...and there's no break in the case?

936
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:36,471
We've spoken with the pageant
administration. We will not negotiate.

937
01:05:36,644 --> 01:05:40,910
They have one choice, and that is to free
Miss Frazier and Mr. Fields, and that's it.

938
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:43,846
-No more questions. Thank you.
-Just one more question!

939
01:05:49,524 --> 01:05:51,424
-That's not right.
-What's not right?

940
01:05:52,126 --> 01:05:54,321
No. lt must be the height.

941
01:05:54,495 --> 01:05:57,191
-Jeff. Jeff, what's up? What's up?
-lt's Janet.

942
01:05:57,365 --> 01:06:00,027
l'm not sure,
but l think she's with....

943
01:06:00,201 --> 01:06:01,532
With what? With you?

944
01:06:01,703 --> 01:06:05,696
With holding evidence?
With child? With what?

945
01:06:05,873 --> 01:06:07,670
With what?!

946
01:06:08,376 --> 01:06:10,367
With Collins.

947
01:06:10,945 --> 01:06:12,207
Foreman!

948
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:14,244
Foreman.

949
01:06:17,986 --> 01:06:21,615
-What are you doing with CHCs?
-They're for the Miss United States case.

950
01:06:21,789 --> 01:06:24,622
-What about that case?
-Were the two of you just--?

951
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:27,420
Jeff, chill! Okay, you've just
gotta get out of there.

952
01:06:27,595 --> 01:06:29,790
Foreman, why do you have
those rap sheets?

953
01:06:29,964 --> 01:06:33,365
A general database check to see
if there were any suspects worth pursuing.

954
01:06:33,534 --> 01:06:37,732
l was doing a general database check to see
if there were any suspects worth pursuing.

955
01:06:37,905 --> 01:06:39,668
Were you two just--?

956
01:06:39,841 --> 01:06:44,574
This isn't a general database check. This is
a felony-specific search for loan sharks.

957
01:06:44,746 --> 01:06:46,737
Say you noticed
on the kidnapping video...

958
01:06:46,914 --> 01:06:49,474
...the assailants were attempting
to abduct Stan Fields.

959
01:06:49,651 --> 01:06:51,585
-Foreman, l want an answer.
-Say it again.

960
01:06:52,086 --> 01:06:54,020
l want an answer.

961
01:06:54,188 --> 01:06:57,487
-On the kidnapping video, the assailants--
-What is wrong with you?

962
01:06:57,659 --> 01:06:59,490
-Say it faster.
-What's wrong with you?

963
01:06:59,661 --> 01:07:02,289
The assailants were attempting
to abduct Stan Fields...

964
01:07:02,463 --> 01:07:05,660
...and you found out that Stan Fields
had a gambling problem. Water.

965
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:08,427
l saw the assailants attempting
to abduct Stan Fields...

966
01:07:08,603 --> 01:07:11,663
...so l pursued the matter and found
out he has a gambling problem.

967
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,774
You pursued the matter further?
Under whose authority?

968
01:07:14,942 --> 01:07:18,070
-You've gotta lie, Foreman.
-Foreman, l am waiting.

969
01:07:18,246 --> 01:07:21,511
Tell him that l'm dizzy from smashing
a suspect's head into the wall...

970
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:23,708
...and l can't remember.
That always works.

971
01:07:23,885 --> 01:07:25,682
You know what l like to do? Faint.

972
01:07:25,853 --> 01:07:28,617
We can't do this, guys. He's honest.

973
01:07:28,856 --> 01:07:31,916
-Jeff, tell him the truth.
-The truth?

974
01:07:32,093 --> 01:07:34,323
-Are you sure?
-Am l sure l want the truth?

975
01:07:34,495 --> 01:07:36,759
Foreman, l want you to get a CAT scan.

976
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:41,397
l didn't get this information.
Agents Hart and Fuller did.

977
01:07:41,569 --> 01:07:44,732
-How? They're in New York.
-Well, at the airport--

978
01:07:44,906 --> 01:07:47,067
They're not in New York.

979
01:07:57,318 --> 01:07:58,649
Hart?

980
01:08:00,421 --> 01:08:03,413
-Yes, sir.
-l assume that Agent Fuller is with you.

981
01:08:03,591 --> 01:08:05,752
-Yes, sir.
-And Joel.

982
01:08:05,927 --> 01:08:07,827
Hello, Walter.

983
01:08:10,865 --> 01:08:14,528
l want all of you
in the situation room now.

984
01:08:15,002 --> 01:08:17,436
-That is exactly what l want. That's right.
-Sir.

985
01:08:18,706 --> 01:08:21,539
l want you to know that none of this
was Agent Foreman's idea.

986
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:24,610
Oh, l know, l know.
Because Foreman doesn't have any ideas.

987
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:26,770
This has you written all over it, Hart.

988
01:08:26,948 --> 01:08:29,508
You've really gotta do things
your way, don't you?

989
01:08:29,684 --> 01:08:33,176
Dolce and Gabbana always said we should
express our own personal style, sir.

990
01:08:33,354 --> 01:08:36,016
-They were talking about a vest--
-You're no super agent.

991
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:40,524
You're just a loose cannon who lucked into
being in the right place at the right time.

992
01:08:40,695 --> 01:08:42,925
You don't have to be that hard on her.
She was--

993
01:08:43,097 --> 01:08:45,588
Oh, l am so glad you're with her
on this, Fuller...

994
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:48,668
...because you two are going down
together. The works.

995
01:08:48,836 --> 01:08:52,533
-Review board, departmental hearings--
-Sir, we got another message e-mailed.

996
01:08:53,007 --> 01:08:54,668
Show me.

997
01:08:55,276 --> 01:08:58,712
-Play it.
-This is Cheryl Frazier.

998
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,041
Hi, again.

999
01:09:01,215 --> 01:09:06,050
The deadline has been changed.
It's not tomorrow, it's tonight.

1000
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:09,246
The kidnappers are going to fax instructions
to the pageant...

1001
01:09:09,424 --> 01:09:11,187
...where the 5 million should be sent.

1002
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,795
And if they don't receive it,
I'm going to be dead.

1003
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:21,027
And I know it's a lot of money,
but it's my booty on the line.

1004
01:09:22,103 --> 01:09:24,264
-So....
-This is Stan Fields...

1005
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:29,968
...and she's too young to die.
And I'm not as old as I look. So please.

1006
01:09:30,378 --> 01:09:31,709
We also got this, sir.

1007
01:09:31,879 --> 01:09:35,975
A clerk at a print store saw a suspicious
man e-mail a message about an hour ago.

1008
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:40,086
Aerial spotted a pickup truck matching
the vehicle in the kidnapping video...

1009
01:09:40,254 --> 01:09:42,279
-...heading south on 1 5.
-You see this?

1010
01:09:42,457 --> 01:09:47,360
This is real information.
Not Dolly Parton and senior homes.

1011
01:09:47,528 --> 01:09:49,223
That's how we do it in Vegas.

1012
01:09:50,665 --> 01:09:54,226
l want roadblocks on l-1 5
and increased surveillance at the airports.

1013
01:09:54,402 --> 01:09:56,597
-Foreman?
-Yes, sir.

1014
01:09:56,771 --> 01:10:00,707
l want you to put agents Hart, Fuller and
Joel on the first flight back to New York.

1015
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:04,140
To make sure there's no problem,
Okun and Hills will be going with you.

1016
01:10:04,312 --> 01:10:07,179
And if you get it wrong this time,
you are fired. Do you copy?

1017
01:10:07,348 --> 01:10:11,079
That won't be necessary, because nobody
is getting fired, and nobody is leaving.

1018
01:10:11,252 --> 01:10:12,549
Wrong again, Hart!

1019
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,622
And if l ever see you in my city again,
you can forget about the review board.

1020
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:19,259
l will have you arrested
for obstruction of justice...

1021
01:10:19,427 --> 01:10:23,693
...and you can spend a very long time
in Las Vegas, in a jail cell.

1022
01:10:23,865 --> 01:10:29,326
l have really had just about enough of your
rudeness and insensitivity and cologne.

1023
01:10:29,504 --> 01:10:33,031
Oh, really? And what are you gonna do
about it? Call the director?

1024
01:10:33,207 --> 01:10:35,903
Go ahead. l got off the phone with him.
Know what he said?

1025
01:10:36,077 --> 01:10:38,978
He said that you are the biggest mistake
he ever made.

1026
01:10:39,647 --> 01:10:41,615
And he said, and l quote...

1027
01:10:41,782 --> 01:10:45,912
...that you ''have become a liability
and an embarrassment to the Bureau.''

1028
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:58,884
Now, get going.

1029
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:33,245
Okun.

1030
01:11:33,424 --> 01:11:37,326
lt's Collins.
Yes, sir, we're at the airport.

1031
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,792
-ls he mad at me?
-Sorry, sir, l'm losing you.

1032
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:43,365
-Does he wanna talk to me?
-Foreman! Leave him alone!

1033
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:46,068
Now boarding, flight 624 to New York.

1034
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:57,239
Yeah. l was looking at your ad...

1035
01:11:57,414 --> 01:12:01,316
...and l was wondering if you have
a Dolly Parton performer.

1036
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:03,609
No?

1037
01:12:05,556 --> 01:12:06,784
Okay.

1038
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:15,128
Hart, maybe you were right about Dolly.
Maybe you just had the wrong Dolly.

1039
01:12:15,299 --> 01:12:17,563
-You don't know if they have a Dolly.
-They don't.

1040
01:12:17,735 --> 01:12:20,568
l just called there, and they said
the only place in Vegas...

1041
01:12:20,738 --> 01:12:23,798
...that has a Dolly Parton performer
is the Oasis Drag Club.

1042
01:12:23,974 --> 01:12:26,306
Just get on the plane, Fuller.

1043
01:12:29,246 --> 01:12:32,682
-Do you wanna save Cheryl or not?
-l'm gonna get her killed.

1044
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:36,308
What's up with you? What happened
to that girl from the pageant?

1045
01:12:36,487 --> 01:12:38,284
She's gone.

1046
01:12:38,455 --> 01:12:42,323
Her boyfriend, Eric Matthews, broke up
with her, and it was absolutely devastating.

1047
01:12:42,493 --> 01:12:44,256
ls that what happened to you?

1048
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:48,190
Oh, that's pathetic. Come on.

1049
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:52,096
Plenty of guys have broken up with me.
You just beat them up and move on.

1050
01:12:52,269 --> 01:12:55,363
Only you and Foreman
turn it into some big soap opera.

1051
01:12:55,539 --> 01:13:00,476
Well. Of course you don't understand
how Jeff feels, because he's not a cyborg.

1052
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:06,080
He knows what it feels like
to be rejected and humiliated.

1053
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,044
To feel your heart ripped open...

1054
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:14,987
...because you finally took a chance
on that relationship...

1055
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:18,189
...and it wound up confirming
your worst fears...

1056
01:13:18,362 --> 01:13:22,458
...that you are worthless
and not worth caring about.

1057
01:13:27,204 --> 01:13:33,006
So you may not understand,
but that is how Jeff feels.

1058
01:13:41,318 --> 01:13:43,582
Matthews was right to dump you.

1059
01:13:46,457 --> 01:13:51,520
-Take that back.
-l would say, ''Make me,'' but you can't.

1060
01:13:55,365 --> 01:13:57,026
Okay.

1061
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:59,292
All right. Well...

1062
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:02,398
...then l just have two things to say.

1063
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:05,734
-What?
-First of all, we are in a public place...

1064
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:10,539
...so we have to display a sense
of decorum, and second of all...

1065
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:12,247
...l might break a nail.

1066
01:14:12,716 --> 01:14:16,083
Take it back! Take it back.

1067
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,683
Jeez!

1068
01:14:21,525 --> 01:14:24,426
All the stuff that Collins said back there
was a bunch of bull.

1069
01:14:24,595 --> 01:14:26,620
You figured out the limo driver was dirty.

1070
01:14:26,797 --> 01:14:29,163
You figured out that they were after Stan.

1071
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,597
You're not lucky. You're good.

1072
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:38,999
Thank you. But take it back,
take it back, take it back.

1073
01:14:39,176 --> 01:14:42,543
Okay, l'll take it back.
l'll take it back if you admit one thing.

1074
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,339
Oh, God!

1075
01:14:46,817 --> 01:14:51,345
For the first time in a long time,
you feel like the real Gracie Hart.

1076
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,820
Oh, my God.

1077
01:14:57,995 --> 01:15:00,020
Oh, my God.

1078
01:15:00,197 --> 01:15:03,530
Straining muscles
cutting off someone's air supply.

1079
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,099
Sweating like a pig.

1080
01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:10,568
You're right, l feel like a woman again.

1081
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:13,066
Good. l take it back. Now release.

1082
01:15:13,577 --> 01:15:15,067
You first.

1083
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:16,473
-On three.
-One.

1084
01:15:16,647 --> 01:15:19,115
Two. Three.

1085
01:15:20,884 --> 01:15:23,682
Oh, no.

1086
01:15:24,788 --> 01:15:26,688
Okay, just to show you l trust you.

1087
01:15:31,395 --> 01:15:36,025
Now boarding all passengers
for flight 624 to New York.

1088
01:15:36,767 --> 01:15:38,257
Thanks.

1089
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:40,465
All right.

1090
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:44,398
Okay, kids, time for the circus
to leave town.

1091
01:15:45,175 --> 01:15:47,143
Come on, girls.

1092
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:49,436
How are we gonna get rid of these guys?

1093
01:15:49,613 --> 01:15:51,604
l don't know. But it has to be subtle.

1094
01:15:51,782 --> 01:15:53,249
Keep it moving.

1095
01:15:56,587 --> 01:15:58,452
God!

1096
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:00,379
Lordy!

1097
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:02,218
Ladies' time.

1098
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:05,555
l have the cramps. l have to--
l have to go to the bathroom.

1099
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:07,128
There's one on the plane.

1100
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:11,290
l know, but, guys, PMS for me means
''pants might shred,'' so l gotta--

1101
01:16:11,468 --> 01:16:15,302
-Forget it, Hart.
-Guys, you don't understand. l bloat.

1102
01:16:15,472 --> 01:16:20,239
l take on water, and l expand, and l may
change the cabin pressure of that plane.

1103
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,401
l gotta take her to the bathroom.

1104
01:16:23,814 --> 01:16:27,250
-l need a tampon!
-You heard her, we got a agent down.

1105
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,885
We need tampons!

1106
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:33,278
-l'm not getting those.
-l don't do it for my wife.

1107
01:16:33,457 --> 01:16:35,789
This is a job for a real man.
Any particular brand?

1108
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:38,484
-Any brand.
-Janet liked the ones in the blue box...

1109
01:16:38,662 --> 01:16:39,959
...with the daisies on it.

1110
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:43,964
You're really not following this, are you?
Something's up.

1111
01:16:50,207 --> 01:16:52,107
Tampons.

1112
01:16:56,079 --> 01:16:57,910
Give them a couple minutes.

1113
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,053
Zero-one, what do you got?

1114
01:17:14,031 --> 01:17:17,933
-No movement. Good to go.
-Copy that. Griffin, go to green.

1115
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,585
FBl! Get down!

1116
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:43,292
-Nobody move!
-Clear!

1117
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,860
Sir, it's empty.

1118
01:17:46,596 --> 01:17:49,156
You heard the FBl, bro.
They're not gonna pay.

1119
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,857
They'll pay, or we'll kill Fields
and Frazier.

1120
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:54,503
Let's see them explain that
at their press conference.

1121
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:57,663
-How'd you know they'd come?
-Choppers.

1122
01:17:57,841 --> 01:18:00,366
Twice a day they fly to Vegas
to do traffic reports...

1123
01:18:00,544 --> 01:18:02,978
...but that last one didn't come
at rush hour.

1124
01:18:03,146 --> 01:18:04,636
l knew it was them.

1125
01:18:04,815 --> 01:18:07,249
l said, stay down!

1126
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:15,614
Griffin, secure a 500-foot perimeter
and get me something.

1127
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:19,558
Tire tracks, cigarette butts for DNA,
but something.

1128
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,755
You got it, sir.

1129
01:18:23,667 --> 01:18:27,933
Sir, l just got a call from Agent Okun.
Hart didn't get on the plane.

1130
01:18:30,273 --> 01:18:32,673
l need a minute with Agent McCarren.

1131
01:18:38,315 --> 01:18:41,580
Well, apparently, she faked a case
of cramps and escaped with Fuller.

1132
01:18:41,752 --> 01:18:43,310
Where's your idiot boyfriend?

1133
01:18:43,487 --> 01:18:47,446
Ex-boyfriend! He was on his way to buy
tampons for her when he left with them.

1134
01:18:47,624 --> 01:18:50,422
Oh, well, how very, very considerate.

1135
01:18:50,594 --> 01:18:54,587
l don't have time for this.
She is ruining my investigation!

1136
01:18:54,765 --> 01:18:58,462
She's just trying to get another bestseller
out of this, Walter.

1137
01:18:58,635 --> 01:19:01,729
This should be your bestseller.

1138
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:04,430
You're right.

1139
01:19:04,608 --> 01:19:06,075
You're right.

1140
01:19:06,243 --> 01:19:11,681
l want you to find her and Fuller
and arrest them for obstruction of justice.

1141
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:23,950
We're in the clear. Joel, where are they?
Someone's gonna see us.

1142
01:19:24,561 --> 01:19:26,927
They said they had to get ready
for the mission.

1143
01:19:27,097 --> 01:19:28,997
Well, we are running out of time.

1144
01:19:58,495 --> 01:20:00,963
-Come on, Laverne and Shirley, move it!
-Ready?

1145
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:03,099
-Armed.
-And fabulous, except for the--

1146
01:20:03,266 --> 01:20:05,564
Let's go. Jeff, you got the rap sheets.

1147
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:08,333
All right, this guy--
This guy's still in prison.

1148
01:20:08,505 --> 01:20:12,965
This guy is too short
to match the surveillance video.

1149
01:20:13,143 --> 01:20:16,135
This guy is--
This guy's brothers with this guy.

1150
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:17,541
Burglary, grand theft auto.

1151
01:20:17,714 --> 01:20:19,978
Hold on. How are we supposed
to get to Dolly?

1152
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:22,983
We go to the drag club,
flash our badges and interrogate her.

1153
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:24,745
And if she doesn't cooperate?

1154
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:27,048
Violence. l have some catching up to do.

1155
01:20:27,224 --> 01:20:30,853
Then she's gonna call the cops and say
that she was attacked by Gracie Hart.

1156
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:34,656
Then Collins is gonna find out about it,
and we'll all end up in the big house.

1157
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:36,822
-We gotta blend in.
-Not to worry.

1158
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,128
l know what to do. l've been waiting
for this moment my entire life.

1159
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:03,554
Let's go over this again. We're not leaving
until we find and interrogate Dolly Parton.

1160
01:21:03,727 --> 01:21:05,854
That's something
l never thought l'd say. Jeff?

1161
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:10,659
-l'm backup. lf Dolly tries to flee, l got her.
-l'm gonna check out the dressing rooms.

1162
01:21:11,001 --> 01:21:13,196
l'm really just here to have a good time.

1163
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:16,897
Oh, God, l just don't see why
l couldn't be Tina.

1164
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:19,337
-You don't see that?
-l am the Tina Turner fan.

1165
01:21:19,509 --> 01:21:22,808
Ladies, knock it off. We are here
to get information. Earpieces in?

1166
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:24,970
All right, let's move.

1167
01:21:45,969 --> 01:21:48,267
-l wanna go in there.
-Go backstage?

1168
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:55,973
Liza plus two, you're up next.

1169
01:21:57,981 --> 01:22:01,144
Hello. l'm Elizabeth Taylor.
What do we have here?

1170
01:22:01,718 --> 01:22:03,242
Tina and...?

1171
01:22:03,453 --> 01:22:06,251
-Coco.
-Where do you think you're going?

1172
01:22:06,423 --> 01:22:09,688
The only people who get to go
to the dressing rooms are our regulars...

1173
01:22:09,859 --> 01:22:12,123
...and our open-mikers
after they pass round one.

1174
01:22:12,696 --> 01:22:15,756
Could you step aside, Coco?
And you are?

1175
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:19,925
She's classy, she's lovely,
she's perfect to a T.

1176
01:22:20,103 --> 01:22:23,971
My very favorite, Liza with a Z.

1177
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:44,922
-Foreman.
-Jeff? Hi, it's Janet.

1178
01:22:45,095 --> 01:22:47,757
l just wanted to talk to you about us.

1179
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:51,890
-Now's not a good time.
-Is that Liza Minnelli in the background?

1180
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:56,334
Yeah. On the radio.
l'm just home, listening to Liza.

1181
01:22:56,606 --> 01:22:58,096
l don't want it to end this way.

1182
01:22:58,274 --> 01:23:01,072
l know that you're mad at me,
but l still care about you--

1183
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:04,702
-Got it.
-Just give me a call if you get a chance.

1184
01:23:11,888 --> 01:23:15,551
Two-block radius of Koval and Harmon.

1185
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:19,183
Liza Minnelli. l know where he is.
Let's move.

1186
01:23:35,812 --> 01:23:39,077
Oh, you go, Miss Minnelli!
You are definitely on to the next round.

1187
01:23:39,249 --> 01:23:42,013
Why don't you go rest up backstage.

1188
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:43,413
Wasn't she wonderful?

1189
01:23:44,754 --> 01:23:47,723
Bad news. We want in those
dressing rooms, we have to perform.

1190
01:23:47,891 --> 01:23:51,190
l am not going out there as a woman
pretending to be a man...

1191
01:23:51,361 --> 01:23:54,558
...pretending to be Tina Turner.
l can't afford therapy on my salary.

1192
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:57,359
What other choice do we have?
No! No!

1193
01:23:57,834 --> 01:24:02,362
You can do this. Okay, you can
because you are Sam Fuller, FBl...

1194
01:24:02,539 --> 01:24:04,666
...and nothing scares you.
l am Gracie Hart...

1195
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:08,743
...and at this moment, l am also Big Bird,
and nothing scares me...

1196
01:24:08,912 --> 01:24:14,873
...except losing Cheryl because having
a friend like her, having any friend, for me...

1197
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:17,952
...is a really, really rare thing, okay?

1198
01:24:18,955 --> 01:24:21,219
Okay, but l am not singing.

1199
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:24,121
--fabulous Tina Turner!

1200
01:24:24,294 --> 01:24:28,128
Everything is gonna be okay.
Just be Tina-ish.

1201
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:39,765
-You can do Tina.
-Just take it.

1202
01:24:39,943 --> 01:24:42,411
-l am not singing.
-Just take it.

1203
01:24:42,579 --> 01:24:46,208
How come he gets to go first?
l was here before him!

1204
01:24:46,382 --> 01:24:50,318
lt's all right here on my list, in alphabetical
order. Tina, then Tina, then Tina.

1205
01:24:50,487 --> 01:24:55,015
And you're all doing the same song anyway.
What's the difference? Hit it.

1206
01:24:56,893 --> 01:24:58,588
Smile.

1207
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,923
-You smiling?
-l am smiling.

1208
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:03,326
Come on, boys!

1209
01:25:25,155 --> 01:25:26,816
Bring back Liza!

1210
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:45,270
Thank you and good night.

1211
01:25:45,441 --> 01:25:48,638
No, no, we have to stay here.
Stay here. Shake. Shake.

1212
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:53,145
Oh, shoot. He's gonna give us the hook.
Sell it, Tina.

1213
01:26:10,533 --> 01:26:11,830
Rolling.

1214
01:26:17,307 --> 01:26:19,867
-l found Dolly!
-What's he saying?

1215
01:26:29,986 --> 01:26:31,886
Tinas of the world, unite!
Take the stage!

1216
01:26:32,055 --> 01:26:33,613
Shake!

1217
01:26:41,698 --> 01:26:43,723
l found Dolly.
He picked me up at the bar...

1218
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:47,927
...and invited me to dressing room five.
l'm glad l wore the heels.

1219
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:55,037
-Joel found Dolly in dressing room five.
-Got it.

1220
01:27:02,118 --> 01:27:04,678
-We need a big finish.
-Maybe l should take my top off.

1221
01:27:04,854 --> 01:27:06,549
No, we need a good big finish.

1222
01:27:12,562 --> 01:27:13,961
-Pick me up.
-No.

1223
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:15,722
FBl. Pick me up!

1224
01:27:26,376 --> 01:27:29,311
Settle down, settle down.

1225
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:31,940
-Smile!
-Well, l personally didn't love it...

1226
01:27:32,115 --> 01:27:33,844
...but what's love got to do with it?

1227
01:27:34,017 --> 01:27:36,986
The crowd decides and tonight
the drinks must be strong...

1228
01:27:37,153 --> 01:27:39,917
...because this Tina's moving on
to the next round!

1229
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:43,249
Come on, come on!

1230
01:27:47,764 --> 01:27:49,994
All right, he said dressing room
number five.

1231
01:27:50,166 --> 01:27:52,566
lt's that one right there.
Joel, let us handle this.

1232
01:27:52,735 --> 01:27:54,862
-He invited me!
-l'll get you his phone number.

1233
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:59,269
Hello? Can l help you boys?

1234
01:27:59,442 --> 01:28:02,104
What do you know about
the Miss United States kidnapping?

1235
01:28:02,278 --> 01:28:04,269
Tom Abernathy, the limo driver.

1236
01:28:04,447 --> 01:28:08,213
You paid him 200 bucks to park far away
from the entrance to the senior home. Why?

1237
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:11,478
l don't know what you're talking about.
Please leave.

1238
01:28:13,089 --> 01:28:17,583
You know, normally l would calmly
interrogate you, but l'm kind of in a rush.

1239
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,091
-l don't know anything!
-Talk!

1240
01:28:19,262 --> 01:28:22,129
-No, please! lt wasn't me. lt was some guy.
-What guy?

1241
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:24,960
l met him when l was a keno girl
at Treasure lsland.

1242
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:27,466
l borrowed money from him
and couldn't pay it back.

1243
01:28:27,637 --> 01:28:29,696
-He said he would dump--
-What was his name?!

1244
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:34,639
Ken? Cal? Karl? l don't remember.
He didn't tell me his last name.

1245
01:28:35,645 --> 01:28:37,442
Karl.

1246
01:28:37,647 --> 01:28:40,047
-Karl Steele was on that sheet.
-One of the brothers.

1247
01:28:40,216 --> 01:28:44,653
Lou and Karl Steele, armed robbery, grand
theft auto. You met him at Treasure lsland.

1248
01:28:46,022 --> 01:28:47,649
-Let's go.
-Where are we going?

1249
01:28:47,824 --> 01:28:49,849
Treasure lsland,
that's where they took them.

1250
01:28:50,026 --> 01:28:52,927
-How do you know?
-Dolly said the Steele brothers were pirates.

1251
01:28:55,565 --> 01:28:58,125
Janet is here with backup.

1252
01:28:58,301 --> 01:29:01,236
I repeat, Janet is here.

1253
01:29:01,504 --> 01:29:02,869
Jeff?

1254
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:05,132
-Where is she?
-Where is who?

1255
01:29:05,808 --> 01:29:08,333
-You are a lousy liar, Jeff.
-Yeah.

1256
01:29:08,978 --> 01:29:10,912
And you're a good one.

1257
01:29:14,217 --> 01:29:17,880
-How are we gonna get out of here?
-l don't know, but it has to be subtle.

1258
01:29:39,509 --> 01:29:43,445
Ladies and gentlemen, the next show
will be in 20 minutes.

1259
01:29:49,619 --> 01:29:51,519
Okay, let's go.

1260
01:29:52,722 --> 01:29:55,054
You both keep your mouths shut,
or you're dead.

1261
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:58,022
The Steele brothers were fired
from the Treasure Island show.

1262
01:29:58,194 --> 01:30:00,754
Cheryl said something
about her booty being on the line.

1263
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:04,457
Cheryl would never refer to her ass
as a booty or refer to her ass, period.

1264
01:30:04,634 --> 01:30:05,862
She calls it a po-po.

1265
01:30:08,738 --> 01:30:10,433
-Excuse me! Excuse me!
-Excuse us!

1266
01:30:10,606 --> 01:30:13,404
-FBl. We need your car.
-Well, that's not gonna happen.

1267
01:30:15,178 --> 01:30:17,146
Get lost. Hey!

1268
01:30:17,313 --> 01:30:18,871
Hart, Hart! Too much!

1269
01:30:19,048 --> 01:30:22,017
Yeah, l know, but now l kind of see
why you enjoy it so much.

1270
01:30:22,185 --> 01:30:26,053
You are fine citizens, and you will get
your car back. Thank you very much.

1271
01:30:26,222 --> 01:30:28,452
-All right.
-Okay, here l come.

1272
01:30:29,192 --> 01:30:30,921
-l'm sorry. l'm gonna turn.
-Okay.

1273
01:30:31,761 --> 01:30:36,095
Sorry, sorry. What did Joel do,
weld this thing on--?

1274
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:46,534
Just keep quiet, do as you're told
and nobody gets hurt.

1275
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:48,734
l believe him.
Don't you believe him, Cheryl?

1276
01:30:48,911 --> 01:30:52,039
-He wouldn't lie about a thing like that.
-Will you just shut up?!

1277
01:30:55,618 --> 01:30:56,846
Jeff.

1278
01:30:57,019 --> 01:30:58,884
Jeff! Gracie and Sam went to--

1279
01:30:59,055 --> 01:31:01,615
Go on, if you don't wanna spend
a few years in prison...

1280
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:03,986
...for obstruction of justice.

1281
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,325
Which prison?

1282
01:31:08,431 --> 01:31:10,524
Just in case l don't get a chance
to say it...

1283
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:14,033
...l'm sorry for getting on you
about that whole Matthews thing.

1284
01:31:14,203 --> 01:31:15,830
lt was none of my business.

1285
01:31:16,005 --> 01:31:17,836
That's all right.

1286
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,301
l scared him off.

1287
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:26,081
But the thing is, right,
he came back to save me.

1288
01:31:26,249 --> 01:31:32,415
l mean, why would somebody come back
to save someone if they didn't have...

1289
01:31:32,722 --> 01:31:35,282
...feelings? You know?

1290
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:39,690
l'm sure he liked you,
but maybe he was just doing his job.

1291
01:31:40,129 --> 01:31:41,596
Maybe.

1292
01:31:41,831 --> 01:31:45,927
Men. Can't live with them, you can't....

1293
01:31:46,435 --> 01:31:48,733
-No, that's about it.
-Yep.

1294
01:31:48,905 --> 01:31:50,270
Okay, hold on.

1295
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:56,541
Come on!

1296
01:31:59,015 --> 01:32:03,884
-Okay! Clearly that's not working.
-Don't start with me, Tina.

1297
01:32:13,229 --> 01:32:14,856
Are we gonna die?

1298
01:32:15,031 --> 01:32:17,295
Not if you develop gills
in the next five minutes.

1299
01:32:30,446 --> 01:32:32,505
Let's go back through the casino.

1300
01:32:53,202 --> 01:32:55,864
Okay. l'm gonna take this side,
you take that--

1301
01:32:57,573 --> 01:32:59,040
The Steele brothers.

1302
01:32:59,208 --> 01:33:02,939
Lou! Lou and Karl Steele, freeze! FBl!
Freeze! Freeze!

1303
01:33:04,847 --> 01:33:06,678
-Keep going.
-Move. Move, move.

1304
01:33:40,916 --> 01:33:41,905
Hey, hey!

1305
01:33:47,957 --> 01:33:50,084
We're gonna need more help
in sector four.

1306
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:58,731
Where are Cheryl and Stan?

1307
01:33:58,901 --> 01:34:00,664
-Where?
-You're breaking my wrist.

1308
01:34:00,836 --> 01:34:04,636
-Where are Cheryl and Stan?
-They're at the bottom of the boat.

1309
01:34:04,807 --> 01:34:06,240
What boat?!

1310
01:34:13,983 --> 01:34:15,314
Lou!

1311
01:34:16,052 --> 01:34:17,485
l'm coming, bro!

1312
01:34:19,789 --> 01:34:22,724
-l got your back.
-No, no. l got this. You go for Cheryl.

1313
01:34:22,892 --> 01:34:24,189
-You sure?
-l've got this!

1314
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:25,725
Twenty dollars on the sister.

1315
01:34:26,395 --> 01:34:30,058
You're good.
l'm gonna enjoy this.

1316
01:34:55,691 --> 01:35:01,926
-Nothing left to talk about, lady.
-l'm not gonna talk. l'm gonna sing!

1317
01:35:07,236 --> 01:35:10,000
Hope you weren't planning on reproducing.

1318
01:35:32,428 --> 01:35:36,364
-l'm coming! l'm coming!
-Gracie!

1319
01:35:36,532 --> 01:35:39,524
Everything's gonna be okay.

1320
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:44,367
-l've got you. Can you swim?
-Can l swim?

1321
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:48,374
l made junior lifesaver at Camp Mondago.
l was captain of the miniature golf team.

1322
01:35:48,544 --> 01:35:51,206
-Stan, just go! Go, go!
-Not without Cheryl!

1323
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:54,406
-Stan, l have her! Go! Go!
-Okay.

1324
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:57,177
-Where?
-The back is blocked.

1325
01:35:57,353 --> 01:36:00,686
-Go to the nearest porthole. Right here.
-Oh, okay.

1326
01:36:02,758 --> 01:36:04,623
There's a cannon in my porthole!

1327
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:18,297
-Pull! Come on, hurry!
-My God!

1328
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:20,933
lt's moving!

1329
01:36:21,143 --> 01:36:22,906
-Go!
-Here l go. Here l go.

1330
01:36:23,078 --> 01:36:25,103
Gracie!

1331
01:36:33,856 --> 01:36:36,324
Hart jumped in a few minutes ago.

1332
01:36:38,194 --> 01:36:40,822
-Okun, Hills, help him!
-l can't swim, sir.

1333
01:36:40,996 --> 01:36:43,328
l gave you an order.

1334
01:36:48,437 --> 01:36:50,371
Gracie--

1335
01:37:43,659 --> 01:37:48,596
-Miss United States.
-You can call me Cheryl.

1336
01:39:01,737 --> 01:39:04,433
lt's okay, we got you. We got you.

1337
01:39:05,107 --> 01:39:06,631
And so all of our clues...

1338
01:39:06,942 --> 01:39:08,773
...eventually led us here. Here she is.

1339
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:14,039
-Nice work, Hart.
-Thank you, sir.

1340
01:39:14,216 --> 01:39:16,810
-Proud to have you on our team.
-That's great.

1341
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:21,020
-Thank you very much.
-Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

1342
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:22,919
You threatened to throw her in jail.

1343
01:39:23,092 --> 01:39:26,528
Get on your knees and thank her
for solving a crime you couldn't solve.

1344
01:39:26,695 --> 01:39:30,028
-Take your little handshake and put it--
-Okay, Mr. Living-on-the-Edge.

1345
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:32,360
We're all on the same team.
lt's all right.

1346
01:39:32,534 --> 01:39:35,162
Well, l guess he doesn't wanna keep
the press waiting.

1347
01:39:35,537 --> 01:39:38,199
Gracie!

1348
01:39:38,874 --> 01:39:42,310
Oh, you must be getting really tired
of saving my life.

1349
01:39:42,478 --> 01:39:48,041
No, no, it's good exercise.
Oh, and thank you for the ''booty'' tip.

1350
01:39:48,917 --> 01:39:52,853
l felt so uncomfortable saying it,
but it was an emergency.

1351
01:39:53,022 --> 01:39:58,085
-And l knew you'd be listening.
-Yeah, well, what are friends for, right?

1352
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:02,289
Oh, and speaking of friends, l would like
to introduce you to Mr. Jeff Foreman.

1353
01:40:02,464 --> 01:40:07,401
Oh, we already met.
He's a wonderful swimmer.

1354
01:40:07,936 --> 01:40:09,995
Well, you're so buoyant.

1355
01:40:14,243 --> 01:40:18,202
Okay. Come here.
l gotta talk to you for a second.

1356
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,211
Just a couple words of advice.

1357
01:40:22,117 --> 01:40:25,382
Don't bring up the Poconos,
at least for a couple of months.

1358
01:40:26,388 --> 01:40:28,288
Okay.

1359
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:31,288
Now go get him.

1360
01:40:32,428 --> 01:40:35,556
Gracie, l'm so proud of you.

1361
01:40:35,731 --> 01:40:37,562
Oh, thank you.

1362
01:40:37,733 --> 01:40:42,466
And, you know, even without the makeup
and the gloss and all my magic...

1363
01:40:42,638 --> 01:40:45,664
...you've never looked more beautiful
than you do now.

1364
01:40:45,841 --> 01:40:47,866
Neither have you.

1365
01:40:48,844 --> 01:40:51,244
-Oh, thank you.
-Gracie.

1366
01:40:51,413 --> 01:40:53,313
-Oh, Stan.
-l'm so sorry.

1367
01:40:53,482 --> 01:40:56,042
-lt's okay, Stan.
-This was all my fault.

1368
01:40:57,453 --> 01:41:00,752
-l have this weakness for--
-For gambling. l talked to your mother.

1369
01:41:00,923 --> 01:41:02,390
-You talked to my mother?
-Yeah.

1370
01:41:02,558 --> 01:41:06,551
-Does she want her 600 back?
-Yeah, she wants that back.

1371
01:41:06,728 --> 01:41:08,252
But she's very proud of you.

1372
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:12,799
You just need to stay away from the sluts--
The slots for a little while. Okay? Okay.

1373
01:41:16,038 --> 01:41:17,835
Let's go.

1374
01:41:20,976 --> 01:41:23,137
-Over here, sir.
-Why'd you do it?

1375
01:41:29,284 --> 01:41:31,013
How you doing?

1376
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,582
-Good. You?
-Good.

1377
01:41:36,925 --> 01:41:41,521
Hey, you kicked some po-po out there.

1378
01:41:42,231 --> 01:41:45,723
-Thanks. You too.
-Thank you.

1379
01:41:48,337 --> 01:41:51,738
And thanks....

1380
01:41:55,544 --> 01:41:57,978
Thanks for coming back for me.

1381
01:41:59,181 --> 01:42:01,706
-lt's not like l love you or anything.
-l know.

1382
01:42:01,884 --> 01:42:04,216
-l was just doing my job.
-l know.

1383
01:42:06,822 --> 01:42:08,722
But l gotta admit...

1384
01:42:10,025 --> 01:42:15,520
...when you were saying that stuff back
there about not having any friends...

1385
01:42:16,598 --> 01:42:18,225
...l know what you mean by that.

1386
01:42:19,801 --> 01:42:21,860
You got a friend.

1387
01:42:22,671 --> 01:42:24,263
Yeah.

1388
01:42:26,842 --> 01:42:29,675
Agent Johnson, over in Mail Fraud?

1389
01:42:29,845 --> 01:42:32,211
l think he likes you.

1390
01:42:39,221 --> 01:42:41,314
Yeah.

1391
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:48,426
No, but if, you know....
lf that doesn't work out, then...

1392
01:42:53,168 --> 01:42:54,965
...you always got:

1393
01:43:09,184 --> 01:43:11,914
You know what? She's right down there.
You can talk to her.

1394
01:43:12,087 --> 01:43:13,315
Ms. Hart! Ms. Hart!

1395
01:43:13,488 --> 01:43:16,013
ls this going in your next book?

1396
01:43:16,191 --> 01:43:18,716
Guys, guys. l have two things to say.

1397
01:43:18,894 --> 01:43:22,660
First of all, there's not gonna be
a next book. Second....

1398
01:43:25,033 --> 01:43:27,627
No comment. Ever again. Ever.

1399
01:43:27,803 --> 01:43:32,137
Thank you, thank you.
Not listening. Not listening.

1400
01:43:32,941 --> 01:43:35,705
Mr. Collins, characterize
the investigation for us, sir.

1401
01:43:36,178 --> 01:43:39,443
l never gave up because the word ''quit''
is not in my vocabulary.

1402
01:43:39,615 --> 01:43:43,016
Neither is ''failure,''
''A for effort,'' ''abandon ship''--

1403
01:43:43,552 --> 01:43:46,487
And that is how we do it in New York.

1404
01:43:59,034 --> 01:44:01,628
Okay, listen up. Got a change
in the assignment schedule.

1405
01:44:01,803 --> 01:44:03,862
Hart's gonna be partnering with Fuller.

1406
01:44:04,039 --> 01:44:07,668
And the mayor's youth-crime prevention
program is back on.

1407
01:44:07,843 --> 01:44:10,903
-The director wants....
-You're my new partner.

1408
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:17,507
You have to like me. And back me up
if someone's shooting at me.

1409
01:44:17,686 --> 01:44:19,984
Not necessarily.

1410
01:44:20,622 --> 01:44:24,058
-Want some?
-Let's get to work. Keep your heads up.

1411
01:44:25,861 --> 01:44:29,126
We're partners now, but there's something
l need to take care of alone.

1412
01:44:29,298 --> 01:44:32,495
-Are you sure you don't need backup?
-This is solo.

1413
01:44:32,668 --> 01:44:33,965
-So we cool?
-Cool.

1414
01:44:34,136 --> 01:44:35,364
All right, l'm gonna roll.

1415
01:44:57,859 --> 01:44:59,087
Hi.

1416
01:45:00,329 --> 01:45:03,662
l'm sorry to interrupt.
l'm Gracie Hart of the FBl...

1417
01:45:03,832 --> 01:45:09,168
...and our information indicated that
a Priscilla was doing a book report on me...

1418
01:45:09,338 --> 01:45:13,502
...so l thought l would come by
and see if l could be of any assistance.

1419
01:45:13,809 --> 01:45:15,299
Oh, my God.

1420
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:16,738
Hey, Priscilla.

1421
01:45:16,912 --> 01:45:20,348
Well, l suppose we can skip ahead
to English...

1422
01:45:20,682 --> 01:45:24,482
...and let Priscilla give her report
in honor of our guest.

1423
01:45:25,387 --> 01:45:27,378
Let's put our math books away.

1424
01:45:30,992 --> 01:45:33,324
-Hi.
-Thanks for coming.

1425
01:45:35,664 --> 01:45:37,859
Since we're in class...

1426
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:41,201
...l would like to share with you
something l learned recently.

1427
01:45:41,370 --> 01:45:43,895
A little lesson, which is...

1428
01:45:44,506 --> 01:45:48,340
...people may care about people
who care about themselves...

1429
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:51,673
...but l just don't really care
about those people.

1430
01:45:53,014 --> 01:45:56,177
-Not really following you.
-No?

1431
01:45:56,852 --> 01:45:58,479
Come here.

1432
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:01,348
We'll just have to take this.

1433
01:46:02,824 --> 01:46:05,224
And then we'll take those.

1434
01:46:05,394 --> 01:46:07,692
And then we'll just....

1435
01:46:11,299 --> 01:46:12,823
There you are.

1436
01:46:13,902 --> 01:46:16,132
Now go do your book report.

1437
01:46:25,013 --> 01:46:28,141
Kids! Quiet!

1438
01:46:28,316 --> 01:46:30,443
Hey, hey, hey,
put a lid on it, all right...

1439
01:46:30,619 --> 01:46:33,452
...or l'm gonna have to rough
you guys up a little bit, okay?

1440
01:46:33,622 --> 01:46:34,850
Miss Hart?

1441
01:46:35,023 --> 01:46:39,426
Until you admit that fighting
is never the answer. Ever.

1442
01:46:39,594 --> 01:46:41,892
Because what do we really want?

1443
01:46:44,733 --> 01:46:46,064
Anyone?

1444
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:52,071
Nobody? Nobody knows?

1445
01:46:53,308 --> 01:46:55,071
Priscilla, what do we want?

1446
01:46:56,445 --> 01:46:58,072
World peace.

1447
01:46:59,448 --> 01:47:00,813
World peace.

1448
01:47:01,483 --> 01:47:05,078
And the strength
to hold fast to your beliefs...

1449
01:47:05,253 --> 01:47:10,088
...while society's forcing you to conform to
a Barbie-doll image, know what l'm saying?

1450
01:47:10,258 --> 01:47:14,217
You don't know what l'm saying?

-Not gonna happen.
-What other choice do we have?

1467
01:48:38,713 --> 01:48:41,705
On the kidnapping video,
you noticed that the--

1468
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:44,443
You know what to say, Jeff.

-Little further.
-Back up, back up, back up.
