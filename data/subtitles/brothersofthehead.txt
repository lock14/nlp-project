1
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,071
Cut it.

2
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,668
I got it back on.

3
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,593
It's really about the
innocence and loss of innocence.

4
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,198
And the exploitation of innocence,
always appeals to me because again

5
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,795
that happened in 'Tommy',
and I, and it certainly

6
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,589
began to happen with Tom and
Barry, the way they were bought.

7
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,194
Conjoined twins

8
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,557
desolate location, cut off
from everything, where they are,

9
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,709
where they grew up.

10
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,669
They're sold by their own father
and they move out into the world.

11
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,435
What happens to them then? I
mean, it's all incredibly Gothic.

12
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,873
Mum had been having these
terrible these terrible nightmares.

13
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,036
She thought she was expecting triplets.

14
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,594
Doctors got it wrong.

15
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,596
And mum passed away the next day.

16
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,079
Never even saw them.

17
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,516
And there they were my two brothers.

18
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,798
Joined together just here at the chest.

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,069
Peas in a pod.

20
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,748
The doctors wanted to
try separation surgery.

21
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,753
But father'd have none of it.

22
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,079
It was bad enough he'd lost his wife.

23
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,668
He wasn't having the doctors
messing about with his boys.

24
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,109
Father took us off to
live out on the Head.

25
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,598
Didn't let no-one near us.

26
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,748
No-one knew us.

27
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,676
We didn't go to school like other kids.

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,033
Dad taught us everything.

29
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,158
They were grand times.

30
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,115
Music hall. I trod the
boards before I could walk.

31
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,031
I did a double act with me mum.

32
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,399
Zelda and little Zak.

33
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,079
Ever heard of 'em?

34
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,994
Music business now is no
different to what it was then.

35
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,674
People want a show.

36
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,635
Punters wanna see
something a bit different.

37
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,950
Yeah, well, back in the late fifties and
sixties you know, if I'm being honest,

38
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,598
Zak Bedderwick was the king.

39
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,950
Whatever, whoever he wanted he had.

40
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,680
He reckoned The Noize was
gonna be the new Small Faces,

41
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,671
that Chris Dervish was gonna be

42
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,557
the new Steve Marriott.

43
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,792
The band collapsed when
Chris Dervish, the lead singer

44
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,869
took his 1968

45
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,554
Ford Shelby for a swim
in Staines reservoir.

46
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,510
The run of bad luck had left
Zak Bedderwick bruised and...

47
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,868
pretty battered.

48
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,231
He hadn't had a pop hit
of any kind for some years.

49
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,516
By 1974, he was ready
to, raise the stakes.

50
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,512
When my father signed that contract,

51
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,592
he believed he'd secured
Tom and Barry an income.

52
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,398
If you would just sign

53
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,193
there, please.

54
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,550
He wanted his boys to be
able to look after themselves.

55
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,950
Dad.

56
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,557
So many wanted to claim them.

57
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,758
In some ways, even more now
than when they were alive, but...

58
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,152
there's never been, like,
any real concern or love.

59
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,997
The contract stipulated that
Bedderwick Walker Entertainments

60
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,390
would own exclusive publishing
rights to the Howe twins' music.

61
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,873
In return, Albert Howe and his sons
were guaranteed a substantial salary.

62
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,078
Payable monthly for
a period of one year.

63
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,270
Hand on my heart, I never exploited
anyone who didn't want to be exploited.

64
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,678
Then Mr Couling took them away.

65
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,952
I never thought I'd be in a
rock band I thought, if we...

66
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,758
we might get away from,
from the head and that,

67
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,671
and I thought we might go
and get a job and that, but...

68
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,149
We listened to lots
of music, but it was...

69
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,309
Yeah, we like

70
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,719
and we always used to,
like, get the records on

71
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,631
and like at Christmas and
that, like, we'd always.

72
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,709
Put on some older.

73
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,236
Well, like, and, well, just generally,
we'd always, like, get on, like

74
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,355
but I, I think,

75
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,759
I dunno, we've got something special.

76
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,590
I mean

77
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,639
everyone who's ever been famous has always
had something that's special to them, and...

78
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,835
we've got something special.

79
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,435
But no-one, ever thought
we'd ever, ever, ever be...

80
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:57,918
Doing an interview.

81
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,672
Here, and, like, doing this with
a band and doing this, and...

82
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,320
Someone, someone
recordingan interview with us

83
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,230
actually, I mean no, no,

84
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,198
but I think it has always
been, like, sort of a, a dream.

85
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,156
A dream.

86
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,718
All right, hello, mate.

87
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,678
I just want a kind of a nice happy vibe,
but I'm gonna introduce you to the boys.

88
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,875
Sucking it out but holding it in.

89
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,913
This is, this is amazing stuff really.

90
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,475
Looking at it after all these years.

91
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,790
It was a weird place. Zak created
this, this magical wonderland.

92
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,677
He had every freak in the world there.

93
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,435
But, of course, the boys
were main attraction.

94
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,953
It was all about them.

95
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,959
I didn't have that much
going on myself at the time

96
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,635
so, they were gonna give me a
few bucks a week all my expenses

97
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,271
and I was gonna have the opportunity
to shoot whatever I wanted to about this

98
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,351
this weird idea.

99
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,316
Right?

100
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,629
Okay, now.

101
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,589
Hold them tight, press them down.

102
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,193
And just play those three.

103
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,835
Go on you'll get it.

104
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,356
Listen to him.

105
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,112
Just play the three that you want.

106
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,430
Most of the chords, you know, you can

107
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,677
put them anywhere.

108
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,273
You can write a fucking song with that.

109
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,716
Just keep doing that.

110
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,391
Make sure you've got it in your head.

111
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,955
I'm gonna put a song on.

112
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,191
No, it's do-do.

113
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,429
- Just don't tell me
- Don't argue

114
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:18,952
I'm not.

115
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,075
And listen.

116
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,434
Are you ready?

117
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,191
Yeah.

118
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,918
I want you to listen to this, right?

119
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,918
Paul, that's what I was playing.

120
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,039
And then all I have to teach you to
do is play another couple of chords

121
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,633
and you've got the song, mate.

122
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,034
Me and Zak go back to,
like, the mid-sixties.

123
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,793
He was always getting me
in to babysit the new kids.

124
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,715
Zak wanted singing Siamese twins

125
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,074
and he wanted them pop.

126
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,948
The name was his idea, The Bang Bang.

127
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,076
It was my job to sort
the boys out musically.

128
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,037
I can't reach. I hurt my fingers.

129
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,792
Well, it's gonna hurt, innit?

130
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,079
Tom, get off. You're getting in my way.

131
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,354
You're fucking it up!

132
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,675
I need to get that
plectrum now, don't I?

133
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,556
Where have you put it?

134
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,356
Well, Barry threw it.

135
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,475
No, I didn't.

136
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,518
Don't throw it.

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,911
Barry, look, at some point
you're gonna have to play it.

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,069
See what I'm doing?

139
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,637
You're gonna have to learn
this stuff at some point.

140
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,755
Won't.

141
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,909
Have a sing, then.

142
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,275
Sing it. Yeah, that's
a good idea. Sing it.

143
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,476
That's it.

144
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,355
Keep going.

145
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,398
A, E, A...

146
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,954
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

147
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,473
Well, share it.

148
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,151
- There you go.
- Thanks, Paul.

149
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,990
You're welcome.

150
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,356
Keep going. E, A, E.

151
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,994
That's it, mate.

152
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,113
That's almost in tune. Drink a
bit more and then it'll be in tune.

153
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,195
It works.

154
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,709
Maybe that's what we'll do.

155
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,710
We'll string a load of
those together and...

156
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,119
Bottle solo from Baz.

157
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,111
That's it.

158
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,150
That's it.

159
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,752
An apprenticeship, he called it.

160
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,710
My future in the entertainment industry.

161
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,313
Fucking hell, he's there!

162
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,710
Oh, he's got it Georgie Best!

163
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,672
Georgie Best!

164
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,829
They were a shock.

165
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,390
That's what they were
like. A real shock.

166
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,797
Fuck it!

167
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,279
Bedderwick had called me.

168
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,231
He told me, but he didn't tell me.

169
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,548
If you know what I mean.

170
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,792
Two-one!
Two-one...

171
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,279
I was just a henchman.

172
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,999
Just his henchman, you know?

173
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,672
Unpaid arsewipe.

174
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,556
Handling all those freaks was
just another shitty gig to me.

175
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,991
Here.

176
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,595
Paul. Paul.

177
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,240
Look, give the other one a guitar, yeah?

178
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,912
Give 'em both a guitar. It'll look good.
No, trust me, give 'em one each. Yeah?

179
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,830
Give 'em this one.

180
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,749
There you go.

181
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,839
Here you are, Barry. Barry.

182
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,511
No, it'll look good.

183
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,789
It's not gonna work, Paul.

184
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,392
It's a stupid idea.

185
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,198
Let's just start,
let's just Fucking hell!

186
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,318
Have you got something
to say to me, Barry?

187
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,149
You should turn it off.

188
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,514
It's a fucking joke.

189
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,230
There was a bit of a discipline problem
with Barry right from the start, you know.

190
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,232
So I used to hose him down
if he got out of control.

191
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,078
No, I'm serious.

192
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,559
You know, with kids and that

193
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,237
well, you've gotta have
a firm hand, ain't ya?

194
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,030
Barry, you know, he was
always holding something back.

195
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,190
There was always something
else going on with him.

196
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,592
I mean, a lot of people's take was
he's mischievous, he's a country kid

197
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,717
but, no, I think, very deep.

198
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,509
I think it was something
that ran real deep with him.

199
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,673
I'd like to be going home.

200
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,159
Why does he have to come in?

201
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,355
He's gotta come in, Baz.

202
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,158
- Why?
- Well, he's gotta see it, mate.

203
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,149
He'll see, you know,
how much you've improved.

204
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,915
Look, boys, I mean do
it for me, you know, cos

205
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,196
cos I'll get shit on if, if I'm
not seen to be doing my job, so...

206
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,917
Let's just do it.

207
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,433
I'm not playing if Nick comes in.

208
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,589
You have to, mate.

209
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,910
You have to. I can't get around
it. You gotta do it, you know.

210
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,514
And at some point you've gotta do
it in front of an audience, so...

211
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,150
I mean

212
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,231
you know, Nick's the
least of your worries.

213
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,870
So, Paul, we haven't really
spoken about Nick Sidney

214
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,110
and how he interacted
with Tom and Barry.

215
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,033
Why did you stand by when these
kids were getting beaten up?

216
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,512
Fuck off! Fuck off, Eddie!

217
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,558
What you fucking still doing here?

218
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,834
What's going on?

219
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,588
What you doing up there?

220
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,438
Both of you, down now!

221
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,475
Fuck off!

222
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,956
Do you...

223
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,756
Jesus!

224
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,994
Tom, what do you think
you're playing at?

225
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,956
This is silly.

226
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,229
Eddie, fuck off!

227
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,116
What was that?

228
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,313
Do you wanna be in the band?

229
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,550
Jesus Chr... little bastard!

230
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,233
I swear to God, if
you don't come down...

231
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,548
All we want, though.

232
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,353
You will not be in a
band. I will take you home!

233
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,155
Do you want it?

234
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,037
You fucking cunt, you'll be out of
a job if you fucking take us home!

235
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,031
You need us more than we need you!

236
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,432
What's Zak gonna say then, eh?

237
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,957
Yeah, sure, there was
a bad vibe, you know.

238
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,110
Barry was out of control, so what?

239
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,469
Barry delivered when he
was under the cosh, yeah?

240
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,516
The treatment I give him worked.

241
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,349
You see all them girls?

242
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,230
Yeah?

243
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,270
That's you.

244
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,196
He called me, he: said "The boys need
a band, and they need an original song".

245
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,872
Their signature, if you like.

246
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,433
And the only brief he gave me,
he wanted something a bit sexy.

247
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,433
So I thought, "Okay, well, we've
got two Siamese twins, well, you know

248
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,238
a pair of Siamese twins".

249
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,318
So I called up Tubs Puller,
the ex-Noize drummer.

250
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,632
And I knew this art school
kid, Spitz, on guitars.

251
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,194
And I was on bass.

252
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,269
Here we go.

253
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,759
Well, 'Two-Way Romeo', if
you Twolisten to the lyrics,

254
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,432
it'll tell you what it's about.

255
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,799
And then the chorus again.

256
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,077
We're gonna play down at this,
grotty little pub in Stokey.

257
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,873
But they had a great
reputation for good new bands.

258
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,669
I mean, back then, we had,
music three nights a week.

259
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,719
DJs Wednesdays bands
Fridays and Saturdays.

260
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,311
Now they'd rather have a meal.

261
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,630
Yeah, the bands used to
just walk through here.

262
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,473
There was a bar along here.

263
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,317
And over there in the
corner was the little stage.

264
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,832
It was a rough crowd that night.

265
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,359
Really nasty.

266
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,829
At Humbleden, these guys were protected.

267
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,599
But suddenly they were
thrusted to this audience.

268
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,999
They were dead nervous.

269
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,516
The crowd are just, I mean, they're
shouting things out at them, things like

270
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,036
you know, "Who are these two poofs
coming on cuddling each other?"

271
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,791
Chanting.

272
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,075
"Get off. Get off you queer wankers!"

273
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,354
Everybody just froze.

274
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,993
Everyone just froze.

275
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,349
Out of the blue

276
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,190
I'll never forget this,

277
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,034
Barry just grabs the mic stand
and starts screaming the lyrics.

278
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,439
I mean, really snarling it out.

279
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,397
I'd never seen anything
like that before.

280
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,914
Audience are going fucking
mad, throwing things at them.

281
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,479
And then one of the lads just

282
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,631
he just started kind of
taunting the audience back.

283
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,233
Barry's lifting his shirt up.

284
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,515
Tempting them, you know?

285
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,033
Showing them kind of where the join was.

286
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,758
Everyone in that audience

287
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,793
thought it was a gag.

288
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,511
"Show it, show it, show it!"

289
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,309
And then he just rips open his
shirt, and you just see this

290
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,474
incredible, you know, band
of skin joining them together.

291
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,756
It was like a freak show.

292
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,150
It was like

293
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,436
"Here I am.

294
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,750
Fuck you".

295
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,876
Bedderwick didn't want
no filming that night.

296
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,918
Just in case they flopped.
Well, they didn't flop.

297
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,273
That was The Bang Bang.

298
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,914
I called Zak straight away.

299
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,514
"Zak, you got a band. It's working. "

300
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,589
Happy Christmas.

301
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,350
What is it?

302
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,630
What is it?

303
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,236
That's a special from
Mr Bedderwick, mate.

304
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,272
There's a letter in there as well.

305
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,951
Let's have a look.

306
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,395
It's an antique. Don't just
gently, lads, gently, gently.

307
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,152
I hope you can do something with this.

308
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,639
With great expectations.

309
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,072
Zak...

310
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,070
Zak Bedderwick.

311
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,752
Let's have a look.

312
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,479
Look, it means a lot to
him that sheet music. Yeah?

313
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,833
What is it, Tom? Show me.

314
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,359
- 'Every Little Moment. '
- The Hilton Sisters.

315
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,556
Words and music by Bobby Jones.

316
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,359
Featuring the phenomenal
success. The Hilton Sisters.

317
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,509
The Hilton Sisters.

318
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,033
Yeah, they were another Siamese act.

319
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,314
Siamese sisters?

320
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,231
Gently, gently, it's an antique.

321
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,151
Well, what does he
want us to do with it?

322
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,150
I don't know.

323
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,319
You figure it out, boys.

324
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,795
God, right.

325
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,475
Go on then, sing it.

326
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,916
It's not a fucking joke. Come on.

327
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,036
It sounds like one of
our dad's old songs.

328
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,678
I don't care what it
sounds like, you know.

329
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,876
Change it, do something with it, yeah?

330
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,631
Just...

331
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,915
- We'll change it, we'll change it.
- Change it. Take it back.

332
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,275
Whole idea of it was
it was Zak's blessing.

333
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,715
It was, it was his blessing.

334
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,473
It was, it was his way of
saying "Go ahead, make an album.

335
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,959
Go for it, I'll pay for it. "

336
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,509
I mean, Zak...

337
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,311
Zak thought it: was just a matter of,

338
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,790
you know, padding out a couple of
catchy hits with a few extra tunes.

339
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,955
Nobody else, just me.

340
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,429
I wanted it to be me in the room, and
it felt like it was me in the room.

341
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,397
Yeah, the boom boom, bang bang thing.

342
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,391
Really really buzzing
from it. It was brilliant.

343
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,799
My ears are ringing and,
and I've just been so upset.

344
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,995
She's been so upset.

345
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,274
But I, I didn't care any more because.

346
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,033
Doesn't matter what you look like,
doesn't matter what you dress like.

347
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,075
Here to dance.

348
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,072
Oh, my mum's gonna kill
me when she finds out I...

349
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,469
When he undid his shirt,
we kind of fancied them.

350
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,278
If they can do that,
then we can do anything.

351
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,952
- That's fucking rocking.
- Yeah, yeah.

352
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,111
Zak Bedderwick wanted me to get
the photo for the album sleeve,

353
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,271
the record sleeve, you know, and...

354
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,920
well, I was going to do
this kind of Fontainebleau.

355
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,150
You know, the two women that
are holding each other's nipples.

356
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,117
Well, one's holding the other one.

357
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,835
So I thought that, you know,
with the play, with the twins,

358
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,230
with the join, with the
girls with the masks.

359
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,473
And then Barry

360
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,552
he took the whole thing
completely out of my hands.

361
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,993
The girls didn't know...

362
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,589
I didn't, I just thought
I've got to go with this.

363
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,439
Tom was, he was a little studious boy

364
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,876
that wanted to be a good musician,
that wanted to get it right

365
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,439
that wanted to please me.

366
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,431
And Barry wanted to fuck with me.

367
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,953
Testosterone.

368
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,313
That's what happened.

369
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,869
Well that's what I'm
talking about, they're,

370
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,793
they're threatening to
do an expose. Muck raking.

371
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,151
They're talking freaks, Henry.

372
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,434
- They're talking cruel training methods.
- Right.

373
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,674
...Mr Bedderwick, would you say that
the information in this proposed article

374
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,036
comes within any appreciable
distance of being accurate?

375
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,269
Well, that's what I'm worried about.

376
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,637
I know the journalist. So do you.

377
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,108
Laura Ashworth.

378
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,915
Laura Ashworth?

379
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,672
Laura Ashworth was a slapper, mate.

380
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,116
If you're in trouble
and you need a friend.

381
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,230
Laura Ashworth is the last person
you want coming round the corner.

382
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,949
Maybe a cowbell.

383
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,149
Hello, Laura.

384
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,549
How are you, sweetheart?

385
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,629
Good to see you.

386
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,556
It's been a while, ain't it?

387
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,038
Look at you.

388
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,348
Paul, what's this, who's this?

389
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,429
This is Laura.

390
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,468
- Laura Ashworth.
- Is it?

391
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,276
Yeah.

392
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,670
Bit old for a, a groupie,
aren't you, darling?

393
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,517
Actually, no, I don't think I am.

394
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,990
I think you are.

395
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,151
Do you?

396
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,468
- Yeah.
- Oi... gently.

397
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,468
It's Tom, isn't it?

398
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,118
That's right. You are correct.

399
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,590
I am Tom.

400
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,869
Good to meet you, Tom.

401
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,115
This is George.

402
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,757
- I thought it was Barry.
- Hi... I'm George.

403
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,478
George. Do you mind
if I call you, Barry?

404
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,959
Look, he's, he's joking.
I'm actually Barry.

405
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,758
- Call me Georgina if you want.
- I'm Barry.

406
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,070
Shake my hand. Touch my hand.

407
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,797
Hello.

408
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,835
I'm Barry.

409
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,509
Bloody hell.

410
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,989
What's the, what's the fucking gag then?

411
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,229
What is she doing here?

412
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,115
Haven't you been told?

413
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,077
She's gonna write your autobiography.

414
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,070
Is she fuck.

415
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,990
What?

416
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,871
No, I'm not writing your autobiography.

417
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,036
No, I know you're not. See you later.

418
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,351
Nick.

419
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,877
What?

420
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,311
What exactly have...?

421
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:17,917
So that's all right.

422
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,718
So what, are you a music
journalist then or...?

423
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,916
Well, not quite, but the...

424
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,309
I'm writing for an academic publication.

425
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,431
Yeah, you're gonna be in
an academic publication.

426
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,238
Academic publication no less.

427
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,753
- Academic publication.
- Yeah.

428
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,875
You're on the way up.

429
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,554
Well, you guys specifically.

430
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,231
What about us?

431
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,275
Well, you know

432
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,279
you're kind of you know,
you're, you're, you're different.

433
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,588
- You're...
- What?

434
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,237
- young and exciting and, you know.
- Young, exciting, give me, give me a third.

435
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,319
Listen, I'm, I'm actually writing

436
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,915
an article about exploitation
of the physically impaired.

437
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,592
Speak to Tubs, he's got a dodgy ankle.

438
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,915
Of course, I had this image of
these two young victims, these

439
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,117
poor defenceless boys that
were being totally exploited.

440
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,870
And then

441
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,592
when I see these, these, these, these

442
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,393
young, vibrant men with this
energy and this presence, and

443
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,632
it just threw me totally.

444
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,757
When Mr Bedderwick
approached me with the Laura

445
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,909
Ashworth problem

446
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,036
I suggested he took her on the payroll.

447
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,318
I knew she wouldn't be able
to resist recapturing her past.

448
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,517
And I knew she wouldn't be
able to resist the twins.

449
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,635
It was child psychology.

450
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,714
So have you interviewed loads
of other bands and stuff, Laura?

451
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,072
Unofficially, yes.

452
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,150
Off, off the record.

453
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,231
- Co, covert, covert operations.
- Off the record. On the QT.

454
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,912
- Yeah.
- Microphone down your panties?

455
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,956
Barry.

456
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,189
I have to keep him on a lead.

457
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,871
- Do you?
- Yeah.

458
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,313
Is that your job,
between the two of you?

459
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,833
Yeah. Yes.

460
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,109
- Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,477
How do you, how do you feel
about the people at Humbleden?

462
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,790
- Tubs and Spitz?
- Tubs and Spitz. It's...

463
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,312
And...

464
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,829
It's a great crowd.

465
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,756
You like them?

466
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,715
Yeah, well, the...

467
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,391
you know, there's lots of...

468
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,674
And Mick and Aaron and...

469
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,749
Felix and Ben.

470
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,150
Are there any people,
in particular that you

471
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,311
you get on with more than.

472
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,355
Ask him about Adelle.

473
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,270
Who's Adelle?

474
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,596
Adelle.

475
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,279
- Adelle?
- Just a girl I like.

476
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,951
Just a girl.

477
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,553
Oh, really? Is there interest already?

478
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,073
Well, you wanna ask Tom about that.

479
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,831
Tell me about Adelle.

480
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,194
No, it's not important.

481
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,278
No, go on, te...

482
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,876
Am I embarrassing you?

483
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,437
No, don't

484
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,669
What, what's that?

485
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,192
- What was he gonna hand me?
- It's just my songbook.

486
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,791
It's what I write my chords
in and that, and like...

487
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,199
Have you written a song about a girl?

488
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,871
No.

489
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,235
It's talking, talking dirty.

490
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,991
And,

491
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,631
says you, says you wanna, says you
wanna, says you wanna have sex with her.

492
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,153
What?

493
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,151
What? Oh, what?

494
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,831
Tommy does.

495
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,798
Tommy, Tommy wakes up in the
night, what, talking about

496
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,474
Adelle and that and that he wants to

497
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,754
he wants to touch her bum.

498
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,477
Shut up.

499
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,437
And, and he fiddles.

500
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,555
Shut up.

501
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,392
- He rubs himself up and down at night.
- Shut up.

502
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,469
- Shut up.
- He does.

503
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,754
- He does. He does.
- Shut up. Shut up.

504
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,751
- He wakes up in the night and he's always
- Just shut up. Just...

505
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,717
and I can feel the bed rolling
around and I know it's...

506
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,399
Look, just shut up, Barry.

507
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,390
What's that?

508
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,629
What's that, he likes to touch himself?

509
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,834
Barry, just shut up.

510
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,955
Right, guys, why don't we just Shut up.

511
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,393
- Cos Tommy likes...
- Shut up.

512
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,151
Does Tommy like to touch?

513
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,355
Just shut up!

514
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,919
- Just fucking shut up!
- Does Tommy like to touch himself?

515
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,635
Shut up!

516
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,517
Tommy fiddles with himself at night!

517
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,196
Just shut up!

518
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,599
Tom, you're a bit sensitive today.

519
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,556
Shut up.

520
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,275
He hasn't had his normal morning wank.

521
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,668
Probably heard it all before.

522
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,870
What?

523
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,272
Probably wanked boys off yourself.

524
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,676
Barry.

525
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,355
You two should go upstairs
and take your boots off.

526
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,796
And go in there and spread your legs.

527
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,836
Okay,so, can I ask you what

528
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,354
what happened there?

529
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,396
He speaks the truth.

530
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,036
Who, who does?

531
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,549
Hasn't got a name.

532
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,037
He's just there.

533
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,836
What?

534
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,955
It's nothing. sits there.

535
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,075
It's nothing, nothing's there.

536
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,831
Just...

537
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,473
just sometimes

538
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,109
I'm just interested to know.

539
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,038
<i>heil, Sieg heil, Sieg heil</i>

540
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,040
<i>In the first series forty-seven
left wing protesters were arrested.</i>

541
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,275
<i>Tension rose still higher
as the National Front march,</i>

542
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,399
<i>well over a thousand strong, reached
the entrance to Red Lion Square.</i>

543
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,237
<i>Their way was left-wingers</i>

544
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,595
<i>and both sides were
kept apart by the police.</i>

545
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,551
I noticed that Tom was writing
stuff down, he had a lot of ideas.

546
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,470
So I let him let him, you
know, just, just go with it.

547
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,471
I mean, it was like
an explosion of stuff.

548
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,198
If you listen to the lyrics of the songs

549
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,956
it was very small, it was all about
really the places they came from.

550
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,554
They always had an edge. They
always had a sense of danger.

551
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,309
Play it again, yeah?

552
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,914
Two to one and one is three.

553
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,230
Are you you or are you me?

554
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,872
Now you tell me what that's about?

555
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,319
Like all little kids, Tom and Barry had
a secret friend they used to talk to.

556
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,913
I had two myself.

557
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,033
Doola and Dawla.

558
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,039
They lived in my shoes.

559
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,752
I don't know what the
boys called theirs.

560
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,949
...bury me.

561
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,195
Bury me.

562
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,156
Kill me.

563
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,592
It was their secret friend brought
all those terrible nightmares.

564
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,879
His oldest trick, right, what it is,
is we got lots of rubber bands, right

565
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,713
from Robbie's box, like,
sewing box and that...

566
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,189
Robbie's box then we put them all
together, and that just stuck us together.

567
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,158
Tom grows on Barry
and Barry grows on Tom.

568
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,039
And that is...

569
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,473
And that is what it is.

570
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,596
Life is that...

571
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,677
Come on then.

572
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,477
Will you give us one...

573
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,595
You got the lyrics there?

574
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,157
As long as we're in
together, be all right?

575
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,628
Bang bang Ready?

576
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,197
Come on.

577
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,272
Too fucking right.

578
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,039
One more time!

579
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,955
You did and you didn't forget that they
were actually physically joined together

580
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,837
because they were two
very different people.

581
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,994
I found the way Tom held his

582
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,228
silence was attractive.

583
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,553
And Barry was

584
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,273
vulnerable and I tapped
into that very quickly

585
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,032
and although he made
me feel uncomfortable

586
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,237
because he was so in your
face a lot of the time

587
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,873
I just wanted to

588
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,639
protect him, really.

589
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,954
They're, they're, they're,
they're right through,

590
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,519
they're right through these posh girls,

591
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,319
hang out, whatever they've got,
the education got, you know, I'd...

592
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,828
you know, they lead

593
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,029
lead people astray, mate,
lead people astray, they

594
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,997
It's generally held that conjoined
held that conjoined separated

595
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,548
whenever medically possible
as early as possible.

596
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,517
The Howes were omphalopagus.

597
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,034
Joined at the lower chest.

598
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,999
As were the original Siamese
twins Chang and Eng Bunker.

599
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,949
Tom and Barry Howes'

600
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,550
circulatory system was inter
- interconnected.

601
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,471
And in addition they shared a liver.

602
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,157
An operation to separate the
twins would have been accompanied

603
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,471
by extraordinary dangers given
the medical knowledge of that time.

604
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,598
Especially as Barry had been born
with a congenital heart defect

605
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,035
which made him the weaker sibling.

606
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,229
However, I have no doubt that that
would have been the correct decision.

607
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,396
- Chang and Eng.
- Chang and Eng.

608
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,993
They were born in Siam.

609
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,750
- And they were like...
- They could have cut themselves apart.

610
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,757
We got a bread knife, cos
that's probably better,

611
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,469
but this is like, it's like, it's like,
like a hot knife through butter, that is.

612
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,556
Bye-bye, Ba... bye-
bye, Barry.

613
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,358
Bye-bye,
bye-bye, Barry.

614
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,429
Do you wanna be separate?

615
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,636
Might do, might not.

616
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:55,956
Could do.

617
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,070
Could not.

618
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,719
Are you guys gonna have kids?

619
00:46:59,200 --> 00:46:59,916
Dunno.

620
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,989
Are you gonna have a kid?

621
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,233
Imagine if I had twins.

622
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,199
Imagine if I had triplets.

623
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,879
Imagine if I had quads.

624
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,672
Imagine if I had.

625
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,995
Sextuplets.

626
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,274
Five-tuplets.

627
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,552
If I had conjoined twins

628
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,669
I would cut 'em down the
middle like a slice of bread.

629
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,835
I think Ken Russell should
stick to 'Women In Love'

630
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,992
which I think is brilliant.

631
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,149
But like a lot of biopics, you know,

632
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:12,435
they miss the essence,
the essential beauty.

633
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,033
- Are you done with those?
- Oh, my darling.

634
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:15,791
Thank you very much.

635
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,748
You're a star.

636
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,958
You're my wonderful woman.

637
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,235
- Excuse me.
- Adelle?

638
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,430
Adelle?

639
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,710
That's just how I like them.

640
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,395
Something I can dunk my soldiers
in if you know what I mean, Laura.

641
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,953
Do you like dunking
your soldiers, Barry?

642
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,439
I love to dunk my soldier.

643
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,831
You love it when I dunk my
soldier, don't you, Laura?

644
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,995
Shut up, Barry.

645
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,115
Oh, hard.

646
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,792
Never mind, never mind.

647
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,558
I reckon what we should do,

648
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,279
just to make this beautiful
sunny morning even better

649
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,030
put

650
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,630
Does it look nice?

651
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,392
- I love it. It's lovely.
- Thank you, Barry.

652
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,708
You look very pretty, Laura.

653
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,911
You do, you look very pretty
this morning, actually.

654
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,151
What?

655
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,035
What, Tommy?

656
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,275
Want a soldier?

657
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,309
Play something else, Tom.

658
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,630
Tom.

659
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,350
Tom.

660
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,832
Tom, play another fucking song.

661
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,599
Tom, you've been playing that song
for the last fucking half an hour.

662
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,193
Look, it wasn't an ideal situation,
and I know that, you know.

663
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,033
And I had my own anger
and frustration about it.

664
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,838
I fell in love with Tom.

665
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,074
You can't choose who
you fall in love with.

666
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,228
When Barry performed, it was
like he was fighting for his life.

667
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,673
It was like

668
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,348
he just wanted that

669
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:31,950
to keep going.

670
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,031
And I think he was afraid it would stop.

671
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,393
I think the thought of not
having that kind of sense of

672
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,154
of power, maybe.

673
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,153
Sense of being wanted.

674
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,835
Of being adored.

675
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,078
I think that frightened Barry a lot.

676
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,476
Fuck off!

677
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,796
Fuck off!

678
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,153
Stop it!

679
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,470
Stop it!

680
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,197
All right, Tom, all right.

681
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,110
Get off!

682
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,749
There were always fights, but...

683
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,073
one time in particular

684
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,275
Barry actually threatened
Tom with a knife.

685
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,793
And it got very real.

686
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,400
I actually examined the Howe brothers
on a, on a single occasion, just once

687
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,277
after one of those,

688
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,196
violent episodes that
they were prone to.

689
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,590
And it was here that I discovered
something very interesting.

690
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,113
This dark patch.

691
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,637
And growth of some kind.

692
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,959
Now, Barry's mood swings and
restlessness and general paranoia

693
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,635
are indicative of
amphetamine abuse, but...

694
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,436
those symptoms can also
be attributed to a tumour.

695
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,116
There have been cases where one
twin is encapsulated in a cyst

696
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,156
or tumour inside the other.

697
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,916
It's known as foetus in fetu.

698
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,710
There was the case of a
farmer, aged twenty-eight,

699
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,360
who went to the doctor
complaining of a stomach ache.

700
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,833
He was found to have a thirteen
pound foetal twin inside his abdomen.

701
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,239
On opening the head of the foetus,

702
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,471
two additional foetuses were
found in the cranial cavity.

703
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,353
It's conceivable

704
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,598
that Barry Howe

705
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,755
harboured the rudiments of a
third foetus in his cranium.

706
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,795
A lot of people have asked
me about this, this third head

707
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,957
on, on the shoulders
of the, of the brothers.

708
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,752
In the novel I just, I just simply
didn't believe it, because things

709
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,673
don't grow like that, whereas

710
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,389
a sort of growth on the... on
the back of the neck.

711
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,917
These, these things, you know, are
medically documented in such cases.

712
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,436
But I did think it was a
wonderful metaphor for their

713
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,875
for their genius, if you, if you like.

714
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,794
It was as though it, it, it
contained the essence of their being.

715
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,076
If you stopped and tried to
change the world every time

716
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,310
you've got the camera turning,

717
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,157
I guess you'd never make a
film, and maybe you shouldn't.

718
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,069
Maybe you should never be there for...

719
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:37,910
I know one thing.

720
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,913
We should have had a
psychiatrist at Humbleden.

721
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,913
You know, if you're gonna push all
those buttons with people's psyches

722
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,437
somebody should be there qualified to
handle it when it gets out of control.

723
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,590
Is there anyone here
tonight called William?

724
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,752
William? Is there anyone
called William here?

725
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,916
Yeah.

726
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,678
You're a fucking cunt!

727
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,357
Fuck off!

728
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,192
Get off the stage. Off.

729
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,236
Put your arm round me,
Barry. Put your arm round me.

730
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,548
Get the door, Tom.

731
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,272
Get round the fucking front.

732
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,759
Get in the back.

733
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,273
Get in the back.

734
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,353
Where are you, Tom?

735
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,269
What can you see?

736
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,909
Where's Barry gone?

737
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,035
He's whispering in his
ear. He's whispering.

738
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,917
Who's whispering Tom?

739
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,713
Is Barry whispering?

740
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,193
Growing out the sand.

741
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,672
What's it saying, Tom?

742
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,430
He's getting out.

743
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,793
He's getting out.

744
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,955
Tom, it's just a bad dream.

745
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,672
Just a bad dream.

746
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,553
There's nothing going on with the
band. Everything is good, Mr Bedderwick.

747
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,992
Well, you'll see for
yourself, won't you.

748
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,229
You'll see for yourself.

749
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,240
And when you see for yourself
you'll be very, very happy.

750
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,679
Tom, how's it going?

751
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,116
It's great, Eddie, it's
great. It's really great.

752
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,394
Yeah? What's happening?

753
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,638
Oh, Barry did a monster one, didn't he?

754
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,518
You don't have to answer
his questions, Tom.

755
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,989
Tom does one, Barry does one.

756
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,399
Goes in a circle, doesn't it, Barry?

757
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,799
- Barry.
- Eats itself.

758
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,032
Eats itself, don't it, Barry?

759
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,349
What's happening, Baz?

760
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,429
What's happening with you?

761
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,115
Tom does one.

762
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:35,917
One.

763
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,793
- Barry does one.
- No!

764
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,432
Barry does one.

765
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,315
Bang bang.

766
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,831
I know as time went on

767
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:50,352
that Tom became less and less happy

768
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,715
with his situation, and...

769
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,950
I know that may have been
something to do with me,

770
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,077
but if it wasn't me, it would have
been somebody else, you know, and...

771
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,278
I think he wanted his freedom.

772
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:06,279
The emotional and intellectual
lives of conjoined twins

773
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,758
are entwined in a, in
a highly complex way.

774
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,910
There may be a physical separation
that is successful, but...

775
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,952
in my opinionl think
it's very, very difficult

776
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,029
to have a successful
emotional severance.

777
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,599
Fuck all to do with me.

778
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,313
- Stop playing for two minutes.
- What?

779
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:53,996
Read it.

780
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,479
It's to Laura.

781
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,476
What?

782
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,230
Right.

783
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,230
Where's Laura?

784
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,275
Where's Laura?

785
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,190
Where is Laura?

786
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,035
Where is Laura?

787
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,710
I dunno.

788
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,872
Paul, what does it say?

789
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,433
It's from some doctor.

790
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,476
"Come in for a consultation"

791
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,635
with reference to
fucking separating 'em.

792
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:46,916
To Laura.

793
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:04,948
I received this letter
from Laura Ashworth

794
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,676
acting on behalf of the twins.

795
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,035
The gist is they wished to explore
the possibility of separation.

796
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:16,238
I didn't send that letter
to Allardyce Stevens.

797
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,072
Who else would have
wrote a letter like that?

798
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:18,831
Who would else

799
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,069
you know, who would
have had the connections,

800
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,390
who would have known them
sort of people, you know?

801
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,793
Course it came from Laura.

802
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,195
Got to, ain't it? Sort of
thing she would have done.

803
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,431
I have serious doubts that both twins
would have survived the operation.

804
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,239
As it was, my response went unanswered.

805
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,232
I never heard from them
or Laura Ashworth again.

806
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,477
Bedderwick, you know,
he went fucking apeshit!

807
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,993
He said that bitch had to go.

808
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,556
Someone had to shut her up.

809
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,998
I left because Tom didn't
ask me to stay, really.

810
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,638
You know, he didn't

811
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,236
say anything, he
didn't back me up. He...

812
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,439
I wasn't really in a
position to defend myself.

813
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,117
Or I didn't feel I was then, anyway.

814
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,511
Really I was set up.

815
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:30,474
Well... if you ask me, I think
Tom guessed who sent the letter.

816
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,111
So, are you guys gonna get separated?

817
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,511
Maybe when one of us...

818
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:44,836
What?

819
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:46,790
What?

820
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,470
He says when one of us dies

821
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,509
then we both die.

822
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,515
Together. We go together.

823
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,713
Go together.

824
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,516
Yeah.

825
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,914
Sounds fucking good.

826
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,352
It sounds fucking brilliant.

827
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,751
So let's get the bass right.

828
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,276
Bury me...

829
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,872
Tom was a very cool customer.

830
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,115
But...

831
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,315
I don't think he knew
how angry he was. I...

832
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,715
I think

833
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,193
I think that he was a walking time bomb.

834
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:39,109
This is a special
night for The Bang Bang.

835
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,759
First we'd like to welcome
the record company people.

836
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,040
And, of course, Mr Zak Bedderwick.

837
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,394
Bedderwick? She okay?

838
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,708
She didn't wanna come tonight, no?

839
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,950
No, no, no, no. Not tonight.

840
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,833
Tammy, have a nice evening,
pleased to meet you.

841
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,319
Hi, how you doing?

842
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,636
A lot of you have been here before.

843
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,156
You have seen 'em many,
many a fucking time.

844
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,071
So you know what's coming don't you?

845
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:08,871
Who do you want?

846
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,234
Bang Bang!

847
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,799
Who do we fucking want?

848
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,074
Bang Bang!

849
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,559
So here they are.

850
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,789
The Bang Bang.

851
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,512
Is there anyone out there called Zak?

852
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,278
This one's for you, Zak.

853
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:37,318
What you give you get back.

854
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,754
This was the future.

855
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,909
That's what we were trying to do.

856
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,672
It was something to do with the future.

857
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,593
And Barry and Tom just took
it into a different place.

858
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:54,595
Just build and build and build
and it was fucking wonderful.

859
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,270
Here.

860
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:23,670
Impossible to see exactly what happened.

861
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,228
I didn't see. I was...

862
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,474
I couldn't get to them. I just...

863
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,551
There's the guitar being
lifted, right there.

864
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,718
Now where's Barry?

865
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,993
There was a few rumours
going around, weren't there?

866
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,355
Some people said they saw this,
some people said they saw that.

867
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,078
But you can't...

868
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,757
I would have to say that
Barry had been struck.

869
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,676
Look how anguished Tom is here.

870
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,953
I just think that he snapped.

871
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,597
I mean, Barry was out of
it by then, and Tom was,

872
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,598
he was shaking when he come out.

873
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,112
He didn't speak or nothing.

874
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:18,756
White.

875
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,910
I didn't see the twins.

876
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,231
Nick bundled them off,
got them back to Humbleden.

877
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,831
All I know is that
they were in bad shape.

878
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,556
It's a long time ago,
mate, long time ago.

879
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,589
When I went to the big
house to collect my brothers

880
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,959
they were in terrible state.

881
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,511
And no-one could tell
me what had happened.

882
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,549
Tom was crying.

883
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,510
In anger.

884
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,395
And fear, too.

885
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,998
And Barry

886
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,273
just stared.

887
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,432
It's like he wasn't there at all.

888
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,832
Unbury me.

889
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,595
Unbury me.

890
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,796
"You better take us
home, Robbie," Tom says.

891
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,036
So I did.

892
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,070
Who's burying me?

893
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,230
I can't, I can't breathe.

894
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:51,757
Can't breathe, I can't
breathe, can't breathe.

895
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:23,990
Shall we do it, Tommy?

896
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,119
- Shall we do it?
- Go on then. One, two, three.

897
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,428
Go on, I'll close my eyes.

898
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,080
- Go on, do it, just do it.
- Hold the other side.

899
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:30,876
All right.

900
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,358
Ready?

901
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,159
One, two, three.

902
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,355
Look away a minute, look away a minute.

903
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,351
Yeah, I've done it.

904
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,077
Done it.

905
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,194
I just can't be bothered to move.

906
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,589
No. Can't.

907
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,634
That was where I found 'em.

908
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:21,159
They were... they were huddled together.

909
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,673
It was like they were sleeping.

910
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,470
Like when they were little kids

911
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:38,677
I'm not sure if Barry
had died first, but Tom

912
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,040
you could see where he'd
tried to sever himself

913
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,630
from his brother.

914
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,319
Where are you, Tom?

915
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,632
What can you see?

916
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,110
Sand.

917
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:22,916
Sand.

918
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,115
Where's Barry gone?

919
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,029
He's whispering... he's whispering.

920
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,111
Who, who's whispering, Tom?

921
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,039
He doesn't have a name. He doesn't...

922
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,675
Tom, it's just a bad dream.

923
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,433
It doesn't have a name.

924
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,517
Just a bad dream.
