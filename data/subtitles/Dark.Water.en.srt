1
00:00:45,904 --> 00:00:48,530
Dahlia, let's go inside now.

2
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:51,433
She'll come soon,
but let's go inside now.

3
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:56,121
What are we gonna do, Dahlia?

4
00:00:56,122 --> 00:01:00,525
What are we gonna do
about your mother always being so late?

5
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,351
- Hi.
- Hi.

6
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:39,081
Did you ring?

7
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:41,333
It's not 11.

8
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,902
You didn't ring.

9
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:55,889
Good. You're early.
You can come right in.

10
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,224
<i>- You've been subletting?
- Right.</i>

11
00:01:57,225 --> 00:02:00,602
<i>When my company moved me
to New York, the rents were outta sight,</i>

12
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,854
<i>so we only took a one-year lease.</i>

13
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:04,106
And when my wife asked me to leave,

14
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:06,858
I got a small one-bedroom
in Jersey City that's cheap.

15
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,319
- How much?
- 800.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,988
Where will Cecilia sleep then?

17
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:12,635
There's a pullout couch
in the living room,

18
00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:14,107
so when she comes
to stay with me,

19
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:17,452
I'll sleep there.
I can't afford two bedrooms.

20
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:18,393
How 'bout you, Dahlia?

21
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,263
We need to know what your
situation is gonna be.

22
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:23,208
Any luck in finding a suitable place
for you and Cecilia?

23
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,253
- I'm looking at apartments today.
- Where?

24
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:29,006
- Where?
- I told you, I'm moving to Jersey City.

25
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:30,473
There's a school
there, it's great.

26
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:32,509
And there's plenty of cheap
places to rent, so...

27
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,346
You got an apartment near me,
it would make the shared custody easier.

28
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:37,848
Why do you want her, Kyle?

29
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,223
What do you mean,
"Why do I want her?"

30
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,809
You were never
interested in her before.

31
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,467
What?

32
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,437
You know, he forgot
her 5th birthday.

33
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:45,272
- No. No, I didn't.
- No?

34
00:02:45,273 --> 00:02:49,318
No, I didn't. The plane was stuck
on the tarmac, and we didn't have a gate.

35
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,446
I told you a million times,
the phones didn't work.

36
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:55,157
No one believes you, 'cause everyone
knows what you were doing.

37
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:57,326
- "Everyone"? No, you. Only you.
- OK.

38
00:02:57,327 --> 00:03:00,078
You see? She's crazy.
You live in a world of your own.

39
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,039
I make one mistake,
and I don't care about Ceci?

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,566
- You don't like playing with her.
- You're insane.

41
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:18,472
Be honest with yourself. You can't
raise Ceci alone. You can't handle it.

42
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:21,833
Just be honest with yourself.

43
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,563
Isn't it funny
how small the cars look?

44
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:11,191
- Yeah.
- If you look at them from up here.

45
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:13,902
Fit them between your fingers,
if you squint.

46
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,137
Yeah.

47
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,850
Oh, look.
There's a tram.

48
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:27,565
And that's where we're going,
Roosevelt Island.

49
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:36,299
Mommy, that's not the city.

50
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,552
Sure it is.
Just a different part of the city.

51
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:42,764
No, that's the city over there.
That's not the city.

52
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:45,750
- She's right.
- Mm-hm.

53
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,985
Here we are.

54
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,112
It is chilly, though, isn't it?
Are you cold?

55
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:58,363
Yeah, a little bit.

56
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,867
Yeah? Hey, look,
that's where you'd go to school.

57
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,369
I don't want to go to school here.

58
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,829
Why not?

59
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,206
It's too small.

60
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,750
Oh, I see.

61
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,002
Mm-hm.

62
00:05:12,003 --> 00:05:14,713
- You know, I got your snack for ya.
- You do?

63
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,798
Yeah. Are you hungry now?
Do you want it now?

64
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:19,742
- Maybe I'll wait.
- OK.

65
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,305
Let's just check.

66
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:25,182
Let's see.

67
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:26,516
540...

68
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:28,977
Just...

69
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:30,896
40...

70
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,673
That way.

71
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,383
OK.

72
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,403
It's nice here.
It's like a small town.

73
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,614
I like the big city better.

74
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:43,617
Why didn't we rent that last place?
That was really nice.

75
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:45,582
It was. It was too
expensive for us, honey.

76
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:47,412
We need something
that's a better price.

77
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,248
But I don't want to live here, Mommy.

78
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,001
Why not, Ceci?

79
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:56,338
It's all the same.
And it's small. Too small.

80
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,632
"It's too small?"
I think you're too small.

81
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,550
- No, I'm not. I'm big.
- Small.

82
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,177
- I'm big.
- OK, good.

83
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:04,304
Then are you gonna be a big girl,
and give this one a chance?

84
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:06,181
Yeah? 'Cause otherwise
you know what happens?

85
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:06,681
What?

86
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:11,419
My itsy-bitsy muffin. I cover you
all up with jam like this, and then...

87
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:15,048
And then eat you up.

88
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:20,487
OK. That's us.

89
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:23,615
We are a little bit early.

90
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,868
We need...
Oh, golly. Five...

91
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,954
- Hi.
- Hi.

92
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,249
- Are you Mrs. Bernstein?
- No, I'm Ms. Williams.

93
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,127
Ah, Ms. Williams. Oh, you're early.
Mr. Murray. We spoke on the phone.

94
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,964
Listen, since the Bernsteins aren't here,
I can show you the apartment now.

95
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,465
You're lucky to get
a jump on them, actually.

96
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,633
OK, that'd be great.

97
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,176
- So we'll just go up, and...
- Thanks.

98
00:06:43,177 --> 00:06:46,120
- Hello.
- Hi.

99
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:52,561
These tend to go pretty quick.

100
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:55,897
You know, Manhattan is so expensive,
and this is practically in Manhattan.

101
00:06:55,898 --> 00:07:00,735
- I mean, it's five minutes away.
- Yucky. This is yucky.

102
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:03,889
It is yucky down here,
which is why we are repainting

103
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,699
all these lobbies this summer.

104
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,509
And I think they're replacing
all the doors, if I'm not mistaken.

105
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,786
It'll make it a lot brighter.

106
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:12,581
This is Mr. Veeck.
He is the super for building C.

107
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:14,332
Hello.

108
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,002
Mr. Veeck,
can you say hello?

109
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,336
- Hello.
- This is... What's your name?

110
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,089
- Dahlia. This is Ceci.
- I'm sorry. Dahlia and Ceci.

111
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,883
Uh... Mr. Veeck lives in 1A.
He's been here for 20 years.

112
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:25,385
He'll fix anything
that goes wrong.

113
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:27,053
- Oh, that's good.
- Which is a big savings,

114
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:29,306
'cause he does it for free.

115
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:32,058
There's also a doorman on duty
from four to midnight here,

116
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:36,479
so you don't have to worry about
coming in late. And that is the lobby.

117
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,609
Mr. Veeck, if the Bernsteins show up,
just send them right up to 9F.

118
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,027
- OK.
- 9F.

119
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,862
OK.

120
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,740
OK, so, we'll just head up here.

121
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:49,075
- Did you take the Tram?
<i>- </i> Yeah.

122
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:51,536
- Oh, you did. Did you like that?
<i>- </i> Yeah.

123
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:56,274
You get to do that every day
when you live in this building.

124
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:05,050
Oh, yeah. There's the camera.
Say hi. Mr. Veeck is watching us.

125
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,678
I'm gonna take you up to nine.
Almost our top floor.

126
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,512
I call it the
lower penthouse level.

127
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:11,389
Um... You get
some city views up there.

128
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,019
A little cut off, but you can
still see the city lights, at night.

129
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,647
Oh, you know,
we're two blocks from the school,

130
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:19,939
which is one of the best in the city.

131
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,566
Yeah, I was just reading that.

132
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,652
- Isn't that great?
- No.

133
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:26,488
- I don't like it here, Mommy. I wanna...
- Ceci, please.

134
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:29,491
- Sorry, Mommy.
- That's OK.

135
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,284
It's OK.
You're gonna love it up here.

136
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:34,149
And they just opened a
pizza place on the island.

137
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:36,039
Do you like pizza? I bet you do.

138
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,668
I like pizza, too.
I like it a little bit too much.

139
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,570
Wait, sweetie.
Don't run. Don't run.

140
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:55,583
What the...

141
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,848
Get stuck in here, huh?

142
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:38,643
- Mommy, what happened?
- Sorry. It's all right.

143
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,063
Dammit.
Another puddle.

144
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:44,207
Sorry about that.
I keep telling Mr. Veeck

145
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,151
he's gotta mop in there
every morning.

146
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,069
You know,
with all this rain we're having,

147
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,822
you can't stop some of it
coming down that elevator shaft.

148
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,784
There's just no way to stop it.
Anyway, here's 9F down here.

149
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:58,580
The building was built in 1976
by Stern-Jackson and associates,

150
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:00,415
in the brutalist style.

151
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,495
Um... Now, what they
were trying to create,

152
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:04,669
as you can see,
was kind of a little village,

153
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,213
kind of a Utopia, actually,
is what they had in mind.

154
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:09,966
And some of those ideas
have come together.

155
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,586
Some of their original
plans for the place

156
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:15,388
were a little crazy,
if you ask me, actually.

157
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,557
Hello.

158
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:20,351
Yeah, I just do that
just in case. It's vacant.

159
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:21,853
- Come on in.
- Shall I close this?

160
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:25,315
Yeah. Let me just apologize in advance.
The place is in a little bit of a mess.

161
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:26,649
Our last tenant
was a little messy,

162
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,736
but we're gonna put a fresh new
coat of paint on this whole place.

163
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:31,285
It's gonna brighten it up quite a bit.

164
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:33,031
Let's take a look at
your bedroom, sweetie.

165
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,867
This could be your room
if Mommy wants it to be.

166
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:39,662
- What do you think? Isn't that great?
- There's no air in here.

167
00:10:39,663 --> 00:10:41,003
Of course there's air in here.

168
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:43,416
If there wasn't air,
we wouldn't be able to breathe.

169
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:44,811
Uh... That window does not open,

170
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:47,337
but it lets a lot of natural
light in in the afternoons.

171
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:49,088
- It's really great.
<i>- </i> Strange.

172
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:52,801
I kinda like it. In the afternoon,
it brightens the place up quite a bit.

173
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,719
Anyway, here's the closet.

174
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,598
You could put your
dollies in there,

175
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,021
or, you know, Mom could
use it for storage.

176
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:04,854
- Lemme show you the bathroom. OK?
- OK.

177
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:07,732
Come on, honey.
Is this another closet here?

178
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,902
Yeah, that's the foyer closet.

179
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,174
The bathroom's
pretty self-explanatory.

180
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:15,615
It's in decent shape.
Once we clean it up.

181
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:17,784
You got the toilet, of course,
the sink, bathtub.

182
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:20,328
This glass is safety glass.

183
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:24,165
I mean, you could hit that
as hard as you want, it will not break.

184
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,961
And that is great for your peace of mind,
you know, when Ceci's taking a bath.

185
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:31,739
Hey, Ceci.
Come look in here.

186
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,212
Ah, you're right.
That's much better.

187
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:36,761
You can smell the river.
Can you smell it?

188
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,973
<i>- </i> Yeah.
- Let me show you the other bedroom here.

189
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:42,475
You know, it's tough
to get two bedrooms in Manhattan,

190
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:45,603
any of the boroughs,
for under a thousand dollars.

191
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,898
OK, that's a closet.
Scratch that. That's a closet.

192
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,277
Um... Kitchen.

193
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,572
Got the refrigerator, sink, stove,

194
00:11:55,573 --> 00:12:00,618
and this is kind of
a country eat-in dining room.

195
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,580
You see this.
It's just really smart how they did this.

196
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:06,541
See that little thing?
Boom - dining room.

197
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,585
You can put your stools around it,
and when you're done -

198
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:10,628
out of the way, no clutter.

199
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,966
The dishwasher, if you're entertaining,
very convenient to have.

200
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,218
Kitchen. OK.

201
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:20,413
And then here
is the other bedroom.

202
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:25,184
So, where's the living room?

203
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:26,769
Well, it's kind of
a living room slash bedroom.

204
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,732
It's called a dual-use room. You can see
it's the size of two rooms. It's huge.

205
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,484
Anyway, did you see the view?
Did you see that?

206
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:34,498
Look at that.

207
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,738
That is a million-dollar view
for $900 a month.

208
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,823
I mean,
I don't even have that where I live.

209
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,852
You're not gonna do better
than that, I guarantee it.

210
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,982
Listen, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase here.

211
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:16,569
We could have this painted this weekend.
You could move in on Monday,

212
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,905
and, you know, we could just
fill out the forms right now.

213
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:22,450
I understand - you want some time
to walk around, think about it.

214
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,535
- Let me just check on Ceci.
- Sure, sure. Yeah.

215
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,329
Ceci.

216
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,791
She's just making herself at home.
That's OK, Mom.

217
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,085
Ceci.

218
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:34,820
You know how they are.
She's just exploring.

219
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,904
- Mr. Veeck. Mr. Veeck.
- Did my daughter come down here?

220
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:00,863
- What?
- My daughter.

221
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:01,924
The little girl I came in with.

222
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:03,424
The little girl.
Did she get on the elevator?

223
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,910
No. I see no one.
Just him.

224
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:09,605
Yeah, there was a little girl
in the stairwell.

225
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:15,903
Ceci.

226
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:22,243
Ceci.

227
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,767
Ceci.

228
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,102
Ceci.

229
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,438
Are you in there?

230
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,190
- Hello.
- Yeah?

231
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:38,568
- What are you doing down here?
- I saw someone go in.

232
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:43,013
Did you check the stairs
all the way to the roof?

233
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:46,225
Ceci.

234
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,583
Look, Mommy.
Hello Kitty. I got a Hello Kitty bag.

235
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:56,753
Ceci. Don't you ever do that again.
Do you understand?

236
00:14:56,754 --> 00:15:00,715
Don't you ever run away from me,
and you never come up on the roof.

237
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:03,134
- Sorry.
- Do you understand me?

238
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,137
It's not safe for you up here.
You could have fallen.

239
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,186
- Sorry, Mommy.
- OK?

240
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,796
How can you leave this unlocked?
There's no railing here.

241
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,018
It's totally irresponsible.

242
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,188
- It's supposed to be locked.
- Well, it wasn't.

243
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,065
Yeah. Sorry.

244
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:19,675
- Are you OK, honey?
- Yeah.

245
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:30,161
You're so lucky you found that.

246
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,873
My niece loves Hello Kitty.
Did you look inside it?

247
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:36,584
- No. Mommy, can I look?
- It's not yours, sweetie.

248
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:37,737
Oh, I'm sure she can keep it.

249
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:39,921
There's no other children
in the building. Someone...

250
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:43,299
No children?
Why? It's so close to the school.

251
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,385
They all grew up.
You know, they're all teenagers now.

252
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:49,555
You know, hardly anybody
ever moves out 'cause of rent control.

253
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:51,367
Oh, there are other children
on the island.

254
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:52,767
You know, in the other buildings.

255
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:56,854
You would have many,
many friends.

256
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,981
So cute.

257
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:02,276
Mr. Veeck, why was
the door to the roof open?

258
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:03,528
- What?
- The roof.

259
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,780
My daughter found this on the roof.

260
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:08,574
- The roof? Where?
- Just lying there.

261
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:11,869
Mr. Veeck. Why didn't you
lock the door to the roof?

262
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,454
- I did.
- No.

263
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,998
She opened it and walked right out.
Now, what if she'd gotten hurt?

264
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:19,001
That's negligence, Mr. Veeck,
and I'll call the union myself.

265
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:21,462
You get fired for cause,
and you can kiss that pension goodbye.

266
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:25,216
What do you talk about?
I check it. Hour ago, it was locked.

267
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,093
- Someone else open it.
- Well, whose bag is this?

268
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:30,763
- What do I know?
- Well, look inside it, please.

269
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:32,348
I'm so sorry about this.

270
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:35,070
As you can see, we're having a little
bit of a communication problem.

271
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:35,977
We'll work it out.

272
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:37,895
I was wondering
if you have a card, so...

273
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,273
Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.

274
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,150
- Just don't wait too long.
<i>- </i> Hey. Hey.

275
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:45,403
Ceci.
That's not yours. OK?

276
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,360
You can't keep that.
Look, it's brand-new.

277
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:48,906
Someone's gonna come back for it.

278
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,284
Can you give it back, please?

279
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:52,952
- Doll.
- Ceci.

280
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:56,038
<i>- </i> Aw. Poor thing.
<i>- </i> Good girl. Thank you.

281
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,334
I'll tell you what. Mr. Veeck will hold
onto it for a week, and if no one comes,

282
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,378
then you can come by
and get it. OK?

283
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:04,630
- In one week.
- No one comes, it's yours.

284
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:06,299
You see? You'll see,
no one will come.

285
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,051
Thank you, Mr. Veeck.
Please check on that lock again.

286
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:10,845
Thank you.

287
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,722
We're gonna live here,
right, Mommy?

288
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:15,349
- What?
- We're gonna move here, right?

289
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,602
I want to.
I really wanna move here.

290
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,271
See?
From the mouths of babes.

291
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:24,442
<i>- </i> Excuse me just one moment.
- OK.

292
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,818
Talk about it, I guess.

293
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:29,864
Now, we don't have to move here
for you to get a Hello Kitty backpack.

294
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:31,199
- I know that.
- You know that?

295
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,660
I really like this place, Mommy.
I wanna live here.

296
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:37,580
You said it was
the right kind of price for us.

297
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:41,417
I did say that.
It's a little bit smaller than I hoped.

298
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:44,253
Please, Mommy.
Can we live here?

299
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:46,964
I'm over here.
Over here.

300
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,866
Over here.

301
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:57,350
- We'll take it.
- Oh, I have the Bernsteins...

302
00:17:57,351 --> 00:18:00,461
I'll give you a deposit right now.

303
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:03,731
- You're sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

304
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,524
- OK.
- OK.

305
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:07,721
Yeah. I have the forms here, if you want.
We can go in...

306
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:08,819
Let's go back in the office.

307
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,614
OK. Ceci,
you wanna come?

308
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:13,892
I'll be right back.
I can explain to them.

309
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:16,327
That's all right. They have
a lot of choices.

310
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:16,869
Come on.

311
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,413
'Cause it's insanely
inconvenient, that's why.

312
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:20,800
I gotta drive through the tunnel,

313
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:23,000
get uptown to cross the 59th
Street Bridge to Queens,

314
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,336
so I can cross another goddamn bridge
to get to the island.

315
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,921
- You could take the subway.
- The subway?

316
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:30,466
You want me to take the PATH to the F?
Are you kidding me? It'll take an hour.

317
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:31,342
I'm suing.

318
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:31,823
What?

319
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,261
You move there, I'll
sue for full custody.

320
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,430
Mr. Williams.
Threats are not appropriate.

321
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:38,766
- Ms. Williams has a right to rent...
- Are you moving to Roosevelt Island?

322
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,101
- Look at this.
- I want an answer.

323
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:43,312
Look at this. The elementary school there
is one of the best in the city,

324
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:44,749
and it's practically next door,

325
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:47,191
so all Ceci would have to do
is walk two blocks.

326
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,819
Just look at it.

327
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,488
If this is really about Ceci, maybe
you could move to Roosevelt Island,

328
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:54,907
'cause there are
lots of places for rent there.

329
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:56,951
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it? Why?

330
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,453
- I already signed a lease.
- You're lying.

331
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:01,122
- I'm not listening to this.
- She's there.

332
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:03,624
She's in Jersey City,
and that's what this is really about.

333
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,627
I'm done talking.
Better get yourself a lawyer.

334
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:09,196
A good one.

335
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:15,119
I'm sorry to say
that's good advice.

336
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,535
- Nobody came, right?
- What?

337
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:41,912
The Hello Kitty bag.
Nobody came, right?

338
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:46,834
It's only been four days, kid.
Don't get your hopes up.

339
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:49,295
Hey.

340
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:51,739
- Hello.
- Hello.

341
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:57,119
- After you, my love.
- Thank you.

342
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:13,444
Let's try...

343
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,764
- In here?
- No.

344
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:21,786
I'm ready for something to drink.
How about you?

345
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,830
Or maybe something to eat.

346
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:27,024
Ooh, let's put you in the box.

347
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:32,004
Can you hold your breath underwater?

348
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,215
- Yeah.
- You can?

349
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:36,675
How long do you think
you can hold it for?

350
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:38,427
- Seven.
- Really?

351
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:39,011
Uh-huh.

352
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:41,639
Look, Mommy.
Look how high I can jump.

353
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,350
Are you trying to break your new bed
on the first night?

354
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:46,185
- No.
- Don't break your bed.

355
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:50,088
OK. Look, Mommy.
I'm gonna reach the ceiling.

356
00:20:57,072 --> 00:21:00,116
What is that?

357
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:02,368
Looks like a leak.

358
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,353
How?

359
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:09,399
I'll have to tell them
about that in the morning.

360
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:12,753
Horrible.

361
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:17,282
- Anyway, what shall we read?
<i>- Muy Bien.</i>

362
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,597
Wow.

363
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:25,933
The sound really carries.

364
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:27,876
Yeah.

365
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,869
<i>- Mommy.
- Hm?</i>

366
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,830
<i>- Can you fix my hair?
- I'd love to fix your hair.</i>

367
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:52,126
What do you want?
Do you want a ponytail? Or a braid?

368
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:54,695
- A braid.
- OK.

369
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:59,216
You wanna practice for today?

370
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,385
OK.

371
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,721
Boys and girls,

372
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:07,433
today I want you to meet
your new classmate.

373
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:13,063
Her name is Cecilia Williams.
Everyone say hello to Cecilia.

374
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:16,508
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi.

375
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,489
I think you can do better than that.

376
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,991
Do you wanna try again?

377
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:26,059
OK.

378
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:30,831
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi, everybody.

379
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:32,875
That's my girl.

380
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:38,681
That's my smart,
beautiful, beautiful girl.

381
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:45,346
How's that?

382
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:48,332
It's perfect.
You do it perfect.

383
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,977
You get your shoes on,
which are right there.

384
00:22:51,978 --> 00:22:55,047
Keys, which are...

385
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:58,383
I know where they are.

386
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,780
Shit. Shit!

387
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,573
- Mommy.
- What?

388
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:07,201
- You cursed.
- Put your shoes on, OK?

389
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:09,102
OK.

390
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:18,195
- Do you need help with those?
- Yeah.

391
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:21,632
Pick up your finger paints
from the back of the room.

392
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,135
Remember to mix the colors.
Red and yellow make...

393
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:28,222
- Orange.
- Great.

394
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:30,891
Good morning. Hi.

395
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:34,687
Hi, Cecilia. You know what?
We are gonna have so much fun today.

396
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:37,189
We're finger-painting,
so we're gonna get all messy. Look. See?

397
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,109
- The messier the better.
- That's fine.

398
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,486
Are you ready to come
meet all your new friends?

399
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,656
Great. Why don't you come
with me, sweetheart?

400
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,992
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Wanna say goodbye to your mama?

401
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,560
Bye, darling girl.

402
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,832
- I'll be here at 3:30 to pick you up.
- Love you, Mommy.

403
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,835
Oh, I love you so much.
Go have fun.

404
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,404
Come on, sweetheart.

405
00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:06,385
OK, everybody.
Listen up, now.

406
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:12,686
I want you to give a big, warm, huge
welcome to our new friend Cecilia.

407
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:19,148
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi, everybody. I'm Cecilia.

408
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:22,318
Hi, Cecilia.

409
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,220
Wow, that was great.

410
00:25:01,858 --> 00:25:03,234
You want the elevator?

411
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:06,362
Uh... Actually,
I was looking for you. Um...

412
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:09,114
There's a leak
in my bedroom ceiling.

413
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:11,408
Breaking news, huh?

414
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,854
Pipes is 30 years old.
Leaks all over the building.

415
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:20,125
So does that mean
you won't fix it?

416
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:25,005
Fix a leak? Look,
all I can do is patch up the ceiling.

417
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:28,217
If you wanna fix the leak,
you gotta get Murray to call a plumber.

418
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:30,386
- Mr. Murray.
- Mr. Murray.

419
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:32,721
OK.
I'll call him.

420
00:25:32,722 --> 00:25:35,182
Do.

421
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:37,250
OK.

422
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:46,819
<i>So, you worked as a copy editor?</i>

423
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,781
Yeah. Back in Seattle, I did
copy editing and some fact checking.

424
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:54,493
Why do you want this job? Pay's not that
good, sure as hell ain't interesting.

425
00:25:54,494 --> 00:25:56,586
Oh, I'd try something
different, you know?

426
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,580
I've always been
interested in medicine.

427
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:01,917
Medicine?
Oh, honey, this ain't medicine.

428
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:05,212
See, what you do is you Xerox
their insurance card, hand them a form,

429
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:09,508
and give them
a pitcher of bug-juice to drink.

430
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:12,327
Are you sure you wanna do this?

431
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:19,292
Come on, you can tell me.
I'm not exactly a model citizen.

432
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:24,148
I'm separated from my husband.

433
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,568
My daughter and I
just moved to Roosevelt Island.

434
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:30,070
You're a five-minute subway ride,

435
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:34,850
the hours are perfect,
and you have a medical plan.

436
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:40,622
Well, you're hired, honey.
But you gotta promise me one thing.

437
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:41,165
What?

438
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,209
In six months' time,
when you find a better job,

439
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,754
please take me with you.

440
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:49,948
OK. Thank you.

441
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:52,176
<i>- Hello.
- </i> Hi. Mr. Murray?

442
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,511
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Hi. It's Dahlia Williams.

443
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,638
- Dahlia Williams.
<i>- From 9F.</i>

444
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:58,098
- 9F.
- Yeah.

445
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:59,391
<i>Hey, how was that paint job?</i>

446
00:26:59,392 --> 00:27:00,559
- Yeah...
<i>- Great work, right?</i>

447
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,147
Thank you, but, um... Actually,
I have a leak in my bedroom ceiling.

448
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:06,774
- A leak?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

449
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:07,983
Did you tell Mr. Veeck?

450
00:27:07,984 --> 00:27:10,861
I did, I told him.
He said that he could patch the ceiling,

451
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,697
but that to repair the leak,
you would need to call a plumber.

452
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,199
<i>I don't know
what he's talking about.</i>

453
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,493
If he needs to open the ceiling
and fix the pipe, he can do it.

454
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:20,454
He doesn't need a plumber.
Listen up.

455
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:22,003
Just tell him I said...

456
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:26,043
Just tell him Mr. Murray said
that he should fix the leak.

457
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,920
OK. I'll... I'll try.

458
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:31,006
Listen, say hello
to little Cathy for me, too, OK?

459
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,299
<i>Ceci.</i>

460
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,759
Ceci.
I'm sorry.

461
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,635
<i>OK.</i>

462
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:38,038
OK.
Bye-bye.

463
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,469
<i>Yes!</i>

464
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,209
- Hi.
- It's lunch hour.

465
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,294
Just quickly.
I spoke to Mr. Murray,

466
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:12,047
and he said that you should
fix that leak that I told you about.

467
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:15,634
Look, I'm not a plumber.
I keep telling him.

468
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,803
I'm not responsible
for building's plumbings.

469
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:20,013
My job is make sure
boiler's working,

470
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:22,391
mop floors, put out the garbage,
but I'm not a plumber.

471
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:26,103
No, I understand. It's just Murray
said that you could fix it.

472
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,713
Well, I can't.

473
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:28,427
Hello.

474
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:30,459
Wouldn't stop, right?
Took you up to ten?

475
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,451
Yeah, it does that sometimes.

476
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:33,295
It just goes up to ten,
no one's even called for it.

477
00:29:33,296 --> 00:29:35,929
I think when it rains a lot, it messes
with the contacts or something.

478
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:36,673
Which floor?

479
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,550
- Nine, please.
- OK, we'll take you back up,

480
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:39,760
and then I'll go down.

481
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:41,386
OK.
Thank you.

482
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:43,872
Shit.
Come on.

483
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:49,669
Who did this?

484
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,006
This building is falling apart.

485
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,013
- Bye.
- See ya later.

486
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:54,186
<i>I've talked to Veeck twice now,</i>

487
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:56,605
<i>and he says he's not a plumber
and he can't fix it,</i>

488
00:31:56,606 --> 00:31:58,222
<i>so I'm wondering, is there a super</i>

489
00:31:58,224 --> 00:32:00,484
<i>from one of the other buildings
who could do it?</i>

490
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,653
I can't do that.
See, C is Veeck, and Veeck is C.

491
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:06,907
If I do that, then I have
the union screaming at me

492
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:08,658
about violating work rules.

493
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:10,382
<i>It's really coming down now,</i>

494
00:32:10,384 --> 00:32:13,705
<i>and I can hear there's running
water upstairs, so...</i>

495
00:32:13,706 --> 00:32:16,625
You know, it might not even be a leak.
It might be flooded or something.

496
00:32:16,626 --> 00:32:19,711
- Did you say "upstairs"?
<i>- Right above me.</i>

497
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,463
- In 10F?
<i>- Upstairs.</i>

498
00:32:21,464 --> 00:32:24,758
You know, maybe it's their tub that's
overflowed or something, I don't know.

499
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,051
<i>No, that can't be right.</i>

500
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:29,221
Listen, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna call Mr. Veeck personally, OK?

501
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:30,430
I'm gonna take care of this.

502
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:32,766
So don't worry about it.
I'm gonna get right on it.

503
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,452
I'm sorry,
I'm with a client right now.

504
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,770
I'll call you later, as soon
as I take care of it, OK?

505
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:40,215
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- OK. No problem. Bye-bye.

506
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,805
<i>Mommy, wake up.</i>

507
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:32,517
Ceci?

508
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:09,053
Hello.

509
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,857
Hello.

510
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,211
Hello.

511
00:35:33,322 --> 00:35:35,073
Oh, God.

512
00:35:35,074 --> 00:35:37,475
Oh, God.

513
00:35:46,585 --> 00:35:49,504
What are you doing here?

514
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:51,923
Take it easy.

515
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:53,717
It's flooded.

516
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,928
The fuckin' brats.
I'm gonna kill 'em.

517
00:35:56,929 --> 00:35:59,014
- You see them coming outta here?
- Who?

518
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:03,852
Asshole Steve. 3F.
And his buddy, dumb Billy, 7E.

519
00:36:03,853 --> 00:36:05,353
- You don't know them?
- No.

520
00:36:05,354 --> 00:36:07,689
Look.
Here's the story.

521
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,693
10F's away.
Father's left the country.

522
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:14,595
Where the mother is, God knows.

523
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:19,034
They've been away for months.
Probably not coming back.

524
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:21,161
Those punks have stolen a key
and get in here.

525
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:23,121
- Why?
- What do I know?

526
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:27,000
Drugs.
Wacky baccy, you know.

527
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:31,171
Look, I clean up this place, and then...
Then I come down to your place, huh?

528
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:35,074
Murray called me.
I tell him I take care of it.

529
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:50,273
Yeah. I patch it up tomorrow,
when it's dry.

530
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,400
- No extra charge, you know?
- Thank you.

531
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:56,321
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i>

532
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:59,657
<i>- Went up the waterspout</i>
- Then what?

533
00:36:59,658 --> 00:37:01,826
<i>Down came the rain</i>

534
00:37:01,827 --> 00:37:03,953
<i>- And it washed the spider out.</i>
- OK.

535
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:04,954
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

536
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:07,165
You can be 10,
even 15 minutes late.

537
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:10,585
We have this after-school program
that runs until 5:30, so...

538
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:13,797
- Many of the kids stay for it.
- Uh... Is there a charge for that?

539
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,674
It's $30 a week.

540
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:19,386
- Which is actually quite reasonable.
- No, that's good. That's good.

541
00:37:19,387 --> 00:37:22,680
I think I'll have to do that, 'cause
I'll be working till five every day.

542
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:24,766
- OK. Well, we can set that up.
- OK.

543
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:28,210
Surprise, surprise, there's another
form you have to fill out,

544
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,521
but we can do that now.

545
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:31,231
This will be good for Cecilia.

546
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:34,609
It will help her fit in faster, and
she could use some real friends,

547
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:35,735
don't you think?

548
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:36,736
What do you mean?

549
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:40,115
Well, it's not unusual
to have imaginary friends at this age.

550
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:42,117
Nowadays we know
not to bug them about it,

551
00:37:42,118 --> 00:37:46,579
but it isn't so great that she's
playing with an imaginary friend

552
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,165
when there are real children
for her to play with here.

553
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:52,168
Are you saying
that Ceci has an imaginary friend?

554
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,504
<i>And washed the spider out</i>

555
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:59,426
<i>Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain</i>

556
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:02,720
<i>And the itsy-bitsy spider</i>

557
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:06,933
<i>Went up the spout again</i>

558
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:10,103
I made you a snack for after school.
I had it all wrapped up and ready to go,

559
00:38:10,104 --> 00:38:12,105
and then I was rushing,
and I forgot it.

560
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:14,549
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

561
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:18,069
- What did you think of your teacher?
- She was very nice.

562
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,613
- Did you make any friends today?
- Uh-huh.

563
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:22,849
Who?

564
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,118
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

565
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,953
Very funny name
for a friend, "Nobody."

566
00:38:26,954 --> 00:38:29,814
- Mommy.
- Nobody. "My name is Nobody."

567
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:36,838
- Did anyone come?
- What?

568
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:39,090
For Hello Kitty.
Did anyone come?

569
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:40,967
No. Not yet.

570
00:38:40,968 --> 00:38:43,428
Thanks for taking care of the ceiling
tomorrow. I appreciate it.

571
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:45,889
It looks really ugly now.

572
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,915
Good.

573
00:38:48,017 --> 00:38:50,518
Are you gonna stay
in my bed tonight?

574
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,087
Close your eyes.

575
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:59,719
I'm very proud of you for today.

576
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,139
Sweet dreams, honey.

577
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:18,922
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i>

578
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:23,618
<i>Went up the waterspout</i>

579
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:28,097
<i>Down came the rain</i>

580
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:31,768
<i>And washed the spider out</i>

581
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,313
<i>Out came the sun</i>

582
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:38,816
<i>And dried up all the rain</i>

583
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:43,780
<i>- The itsy-bitsy spider
- Itsy-bitsy spider...</i>

584
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:48,935
<i>- Went up the spout again
- ...the spout again</i>

585
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:55,250
Well, I still don't really know anyone
here, so I'm not really sure who to ask.

586
00:39:55,251 --> 00:40:01,256
Except Bill and Stacy, but he's Kyle's
friend from work, so I can't ask him.

587
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:04,217
I think it'd be a lot easier for her
back there in Seattle, you know?

588
00:40:04,218 --> 00:40:07,637
<i>Well, what about the mediators?
Maybe they can recommend somebody.</i>

589
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,223
Yeah, I asked them,
but they're supposed to be impartial

590
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:13,726
- so they can't recommend anyone.
<i>- Oh.</i>

591
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:18,231
I don't know. I guess maybe I'll try and
find someone out of the <i>Yellow Pages.</i>

592
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:23,010
<i>Dahlia, you can't pick some
random lawyer out of a phone book.</i>

593
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:26,447
I can't believe it.
Those kids are up there again.

594
00:40:26,448 --> 00:40:28,283
<i>What?</i>

595
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:30,159
Mary, I'm gonna have
to call you back later, OK?

596
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,662
I have to go downstairs
and deal with this.

597
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,897
- All right. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

598
00:40:38,794 --> 00:40:42,196
Stop it. She'll catch you.

599
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:45,883
No, I'm not allowed to go to the roof.

600
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:50,788
'Cause it's dangerous,
and by the ways, it's spooky at night.

601
00:40:51,473 --> 00:40:55,126
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody.

602
00:40:56,604 --> 00:41:00,381
Is it your friend Nobody again?

603
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:11,851
Do you have an invisible friend
only you can see?

604
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:17,624
Is it a boy or a girl?

605
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,792
Girl.

606
00:41:19,793 --> 00:41:24,047
- How old is she?
- My age. Almost exactly.

607
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:28,176
She was born a month before me.
So she's older.

608
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:31,429
Wow.
What's her name?

609
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,166
- Natasha.
- Natasha?

610
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:39,437
That's a really interesting name.
Where'd you get that name from?

611
00:41:39,438 --> 00:41:41,731
It's just her name.

612
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,258
Night, Mom.

613
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:50,114
I can't go up to 10F now. If I leave my
post and Mr. Murray finds out, I'm dead.

614
00:41:50,115 --> 00:41:53,660
OK, but if they leave the water running
then my bedroom ceiling could collapse.

615
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:55,787
- Understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

616
00:41:55,788 --> 00:41:57,789
But what you gotta understand
is if I leave now

617
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,333
I might as well go straight to
Unemployment. That's not gonna happen.

618
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:01,178
Look, I'm sorry.

619
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,711
I don't know if you want me to
call the cops or something.

620
00:42:03,712 --> 00:42:07,173
- Just give me a second. Hang on.
- It's all right, never mind.

621
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:10,551
I'll deal with it.
And thanks for your help.

622
00:42:10,552 --> 00:42:12,870
All right.

623
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,385
<i>Mommy, come.</i>

624
00:44:01,747 --> 00:44:04,290
Are you OK?

625
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:08,360
Can I help you?

626
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,077
I told you.
I told you to leave me alone.

627
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,389
Mom?

628
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,393
- Get away from me, you little bitch.
- Mommy?

629
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:27,814
- I hate you.
- Let me help you.

630
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:30,525
I hate you.

631
00:44:30,526 --> 00:44:35,262
- Do you hear me? I hate you.
- No.

632
00:44:35,864 --> 00:44:38,724
Just go! Go!

633
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:47,583
Mommy.

634
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:48,960
Wh...

635
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:51,379
- What?
- You're scaring me.

636
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,300
- What's wrong?
- You were having a bad dream again.

637
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,761
Again?

638
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,597
You always make that sound
when you sleep.

639
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,266
I do?

640
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,351
Ever since Daddy left.

641
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:07,603
- Stop doing that, OK?
- OK.

642
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:12,400
- It scares me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

643
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:14,969
It's OK.

644
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:18,222
There's nothing to be scared of.

645
00:45:48,103 --> 00:45:52,464
- Have a good day. See you later.
- OK. Bye, Mommy.

646
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,530
<i>Yeah, he was a frat brother
of Joe's at Wash U.</i>

647
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:01,324
<i>Joe says he's as smart as a whip.</i>

648
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,784
If he was at college with Joe
I guess he's been practicing for a while.

649
00:46:03,785 --> 00:46:06,287
<i>Well, actually, he got a late start
on being a lawyer.</i>

650
00:46:06,288 --> 00:46:08,748
<i>- He lost a decade to partying.</i>
- A decade?

651
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:10,750
<i>No, seriously,
Joe says he's really good</i>

652
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:12,668
<i>and he won't charge you
an arm and a leg.</i>

653
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:15,171
<i>- His name is Platzer.</i>
- OK.

654
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,381
<i>- P-L-A...</i>
- Right.

655
00:46:17,382 --> 00:46:19,325
<i>...T-Z-E-R.</i>

656
00:46:19,384 --> 00:46:23,512
Come on, Platz.
This mess was sloppy, unprofessional.

657
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:27,266
I mean, I know I get caught,
but my work? My craft?

658
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:30,102
My craft ain't sloppy.

659
00:46:30,103 --> 00:46:32,104
That much is true.

660
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:33,898
- Thank you.
- Hello?

661
00:46:33,899 --> 00:46:36,067
<i>Mr. Platzer, hi.
My name is Dahlia Williams.</i>

662
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:39,487
Hi, Mrs. Williams.
John told me you'd be calling.

663
00:46:39,488 --> 00:46:41,787
I can't meet till next week,
so you give me

664
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:43,616
opposing counsel's
name and number

665
00:46:43,617 --> 00:46:46,452
and I'll give him a call
and get up to speed on their issues.

666
00:46:46,453 --> 00:46:49,246
Sure. My husband's lawyer's name
is Carrie Simmons.

667
00:46:49,247 --> 00:46:52,750
That's OK, I know Carrie's number.
This is not gonna be so easy.

668
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:56,045
We should meet Monday. Where do you
work? I'll come by in your lunch hour.

669
00:46:56,046 --> 00:47:00,633
<i>It's Sutton Place Radiology.
585 East 58th Street.</i>

670
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:04,011
You're being very nice,
but I'm sorry, I just have to ask.

671
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:07,139
- How much is that gonna cost me?
- We'll figure the money out.

672
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,309
I'll call Carrie, get up to speed,
then we'll go over everything Monday,

673
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:13,562
- including my fee, OK?
<i>- OK. Thanks so much.</i>

674
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:16,065
- OK. Bye.
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>

675
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:20,111
Figure the money out? That's some
sweet thing you're figuring money for.

676
00:47:20,112 --> 00:47:25,074
- You gonna figure my money too?
- You're lucky I don't charge you double.

677
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:28,119
OK, so everyone looking at me.
And do you all have a piece of tape?

678
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,663
Show me, show me.
Put it somewhere silly.

679
00:47:30,664 --> 00:47:33,666
Somewhere silly. Your forehead,
your nose. Make a beard. OK.

680
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,876
Now put it on the back of your picture

681
00:47:35,877 --> 00:47:38,671
and then you're gonna follow me into the
hallway 'cause we're gonna put them up.

682
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:44,468
Ten, nine, eight, a-seven, a-six,
five, four, three, two, one.

683
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:47,221
Beautiful.

684
00:47:47,222 --> 00:47:49,348
- Anyone else need tape?
<i>- </i> I do.

685
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:51,100
If it's not sticking...

686
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,269
- Mom, you're early.
- I know.

687
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,688
The subway was so much faster
than the Tram.

688
00:47:55,689 --> 00:47:58,190
I was at work ten minutes ago.
Isn't that amazing?

689
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:00,555
I think we picked the
perfect place to live.

690
00:48:00,557 --> 00:48:02,236
Daddy doesn't like it here.

691
00:48:02,237 --> 00:48:05,281
He wants me to move with him
to that other city.

692
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,449
Oh.

693
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,200
- When did Daddy say that?
- Today.

694
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:12,163
He came to see
what my new school was like.

695
00:48:12,164 --> 00:48:13,247
Hm.

696
00:48:13,248 --> 00:48:15,583
- I gotta go.
- OK. I'll be waiting for you.

697
00:48:15,584 --> 00:48:18,277
OK.

698
00:48:18,754 --> 00:48:21,395
Yeah, he came by to give us
his cell phone number

699
00:48:21,397 --> 00:48:22,715
in case of an emergency.

700
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:28,871
He was with Cecilia for a few minutes.
He said hi, he looked at the room.

701
00:48:29,598 --> 00:48:32,349
Is there some problem?
Is he not allowed to?

702
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,435
Is there some restraining order
against him?

703
00:48:34,436 --> 00:48:37,980
No. No.

704
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,567
I was just...
wondering if Ceci was...

705
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:44,153
Still imagining things?

706
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:48,616
Actually, I'm glad you brought that up.
Her imaginary friend hasn't gone away.

707
00:48:48,617 --> 00:48:52,286
In fact, she threw somewhat of a tantrum
during circle time

708
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:54,580
when we wouldn't let her "friend"
sing along.

709
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:57,208
I had to have her take a time-out.

710
00:48:57,209 --> 00:49:02,505
I'm sorry. I'll certainly
talk to Ceci about that.

711
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,591
You know, the PTA provides
a psychologist, Katie Shoettle.

712
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:09,887
She's very nice. She comes every
Wednesday. It's absolutely no charge.

713
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:14,500
I'll talk to Ceci about it. It'll stop.
I'm really sorry about that.

714
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:18,145
You'll see.
Couple of days, blend right in.

715
00:49:18,146 --> 00:49:21,006
You won't see the difference.

716
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:25,010
I'm sure you're right.
Thank you.

717
00:49:26,154 --> 00:49:29,824
You know, those kids were up there
again last night, running around,

718
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:32,701
and I could hear them
running water. So...

719
00:49:32,702 --> 00:49:34,245
You know what I'm gonna do?

720
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:38,040
I'm gonna speak with Murray
about changing the lock on 10F.

721
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:41,085
You know what he told me?
Rimsky paid no rent this month.

722
00:49:41,086 --> 00:49:43,587
- He's probably not coming back anyway.
- OK.

723
00:49:43,588 --> 00:49:46,257
Well, that would be great
if you could change the lock.

724
00:49:46,258 --> 00:49:48,843
Starting to have nightmares
about what's going on up there.

725
00:49:48,844 --> 00:49:52,513
- Really? You gotta relax, huh?
- Can I get you something before you go?

726
00:49:52,514 --> 00:49:55,683
Yeah. Get me a reward
for all this hard work I've been doing.

727
00:49:55,684 --> 00:49:58,310
Yeah?
I think I have beer.

728
00:49:58,311 --> 00:50:00,729
- You want a beer?
- I don't drink beer.

729
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,982
Coffee? I could make
a pot of coffee if you want.

730
00:50:02,983 --> 00:50:05,392
Oh, forget it.
I've been working hard today.

731
00:50:05,394 --> 00:50:06,569
I'm tired. I'm going.

732
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,903
OK.
Well, thank you.

733
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:10,281
What about Hello Kitty?
Can I have it now?

734
00:50:10,282 --> 00:50:13,576
Oh, so sorry, kid.
Somebody came by for it today.

735
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,495
They were visiting town,
left it there by accident.

736
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:20,566
Oh, that little girl,
she was so happy to have it back.

737
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:22,418
- You're lying.
- Ceci.

738
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,171
He's lying, Mommy.
Nobody came.

739
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:27,631
You want to teach that goddamn brat
some manners, lady.

740
00:50:27,632 --> 00:50:30,576
Sorry.

741
00:50:30,886 --> 00:50:33,095
What is the matter with you?

742
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,096
Mm.

743
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:38,100
Mac and cheese. My favorite.
I love you, Mommy.

744
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,561
I love you too, sweetheart.
I love you very much.

745
00:50:40,562 --> 00:50:43,480
But, you know, it was very wrong of you
to call Mr. Veeck a liar.

746
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:47,401
- You know that, don't you?
- He is a liar.

747
00:50:47,402 --> 00:50:50,821
Ceci.
You don't know that he's a liar.

748
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:53,324
- Yes, I do.
- How? How do you know that?

749
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:58,412
Natasha told me he still had
the Hello Kitty backpack in his desk.

750
00:50:58,413 --> 00:51:00,998
I want to talk to you
about your imaginary friend, OK?

751
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:04,752
- She's not imaginary.
- She's not?

752
00:51:04,753 --> 00:51:09,656
She's lost. Her mommy forgot
about her and now she's lost.

753
00:51:10,258 --> 00:51:13,076
Like you.

754
00:51:14,095 --> 00:51:19,166
- What are you talking about?
- Your mommy forgot about you, right?

755
00:51:19,768 --> 00:51:22,252
Did someone tell you that?

756
00:51:22,938 --> 00:51:25,814
- You did.
- No.

757
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:29,151
I didn't tell you that, Ceci.

758
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:32,387
Who told you that?

759
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:38,285
Are you gonna answer me?
I'm asking you a question.

760
00:51:38,286 --> 00:51:40,704
- Who told you?
- Natasha told me.

761
00:51:40,705 --> 00:51:44,333
Stop it.
You stop lying to me.

762
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:46,902
Who told you?

763
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,089
Who told you?

764
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:53,075
Who told you?

765
00:51:59,724 --> 00:52:02,184
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, I'm just calling to arrange...</i>

766
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,760
What are you trying to do?

767
00:52:03,762 --> 00:52:07,273
Sneaking into her school,
telling her it isn't any good?

768
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:10,567
Talking to her about my mother?
How dare you talk to her about my mother.

769
00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:13,446
<i>Look, I don't know who or what
pressed your wacko button today,</i>

770
00:52:13,448 --> 00:52:14,405
<i>and I don't care,</i>

771
00:52:14,406 --> 00:52:17,283
<i>I'm calling to tell you
I'm picking up Ceci Saturday at nine.</i>

772
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:21,036
<i>I'll bring her back Sunday at six.
Don't play any games.</i>

773
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,689
<i>Have her there, 9am sharp.</i>

774
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,221
- I tell you punks. No skating in here.
- Yeah, yeah.

775
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,810
She's cute.

776
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:04,413
Daddy's here!

777
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:06,540
Hey!

778
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:08,900
Look at you.

779
00:53:09,836 --> 00:53:11,962
You shouldn't be smoking, Daddy.

780
00:53:11,963 --> 00:53:14,214
I'm gonna quit
real soon, honey. I promise.

781
00:53:14,215 --> 00:53:18,886
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Satisfied?

782
00:53:18,887 --> 00:53:22,056
As far as I'm concerned,
you can smoke as much as you like, Kyle.

783
00:53:22,057 --> 00:53:24,099
Honey.

784
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,810
- I'll bring her back tomorrow at six.
- OK.

785
00:53:26,811 --> 00:53:29,713
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, honey.

786
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:08,185
Hey, pretty lady.
What's happening?

787
00:54:08,186 --> 00:54:11,063
Laundry.
Excuse me.

788
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:14,966
I got some dirty things
I'd like you to clean.

789
00:55:09,956 --> 00:55:12,524
Sorry.

790
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:16,152
I forgot my smokes.

791
00:57:28,052 --> 00:57:30,662
Help!

792
00:57:33,141 --> 00:57:37,644
Smart-ass kids.
Steve and Billy. They did this.

793
00:57:37,645 --> 00:57:42,065
You'll see. Monday, the plumbers come.
They'll find something stuck in there.

794
00:57:42,066 --> 00:57:44,718
They gum 'em up.
Brats.

795
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,138
- Who's Natasha?
- What?

796
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:51,074
Who's Natasha Rimsky?

797
00:57:51,075 --> 00:57:54,936
Little girl. 10F.

798
00:57:55,622 --> 00:57:56,612
Where is she now?

799
00:57:56,614 --> 00:57:59,291
How do I know? With
her mother, I guess.

800
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:02,002
Couldn't stand living
with that crazy Russian husband of hers.

801
00:58:02,003 --> 00:58:06,298
Took the little girl with her.
That Russki, he was a piece of work.

802
00:58:06,299 --> 00:58:09,134
<i>"Suki yobanye."
"Blyad. Blyad."</i>

803
00:58:09,135 --> 00:58:11,053
Always <i>"blyad."</i>

804
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,722
Look, there's a Laundromat
down the block.

805
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:18,960
I'll get you some garbage bags
so you don't get wet carrying them there.

806
00:59:23,668 --> 00:59:29,968
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout</i>

807
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:05,316
Hi, Mommy.

808
01:00:08,337 --> 01:00:11,631
Glad you like spaghetti and meatballs.

809
01:00:11,632 --> 01:00:15,427
- It's my favorite.
- Your favorite?

810
01:00:15,428 --> 01:00:18,305
I love them, Mommy.

811
01:00:18,306 --> 01:00:20,724
I'm glad.

812
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:22,959
Mm.

813
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:25,937
I love you, Mommy.

814
01:00:25,938 --> 01:00:28,523
You haven't said anything
about what your dad's new place is like.

815
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,733
- I don't like it.
- Really?

816
01:00:29,734 --> 01:00:30,901
Yeah.

817
01:00:30,902 --> 01:00:32,986
Well, maybe it's just new
and you need to get used to it.

818
01:00:32,987 --> 01:00:35,322
But I don't wanna get used to it.

819
01:00:35,323 --> 01:00:40,768
I don't wanna stay with Daddy.
I only wanna stay with you.

820
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:46,249
Well, your dad loves you. He'll be happy
that you spent this time with him.

821
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:52,172
Itsy-bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout

822
01:00:52,173 --> 01:00:54,674
Down came the rain

823
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:58,553
- Honey, can you stop singing that?
- Why? It happened.

824
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:01,664
I want to go to bed now, Mommy.
I'm tired.

825
01:01:11,984 --> 01:01:14,361
- Mommy?
- Mm?

826
01:01:14,362 --> 01:01:17,948
I'm scared, Mommy.
I want to sleep with you.

827
01:01:17,949 --> 01:01:20,475
Yeah.

828
01:01:33,881 --> 01:01:38,618
I love you, Mommy.
Thank you for taking care of me.

829
01:02:05,746 --> 01:02:08,273
Ceci?

830
01:02:17,717 --> 01:02:21,011
- Hello?
<i>- Mommy, where were you?</i>

831
01:02:21,012 --> 01:02:24,973
- I was napping.
<i>- No, not now. Last night.</i>

832
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:30,145
<i>Where were you last night? I called
two times for you to say goodnight to me.</i>

833
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,898
<i>- Where were you?</i>
- Last night?

834
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:38,236
<i>OK, Daddy. Daddy says he's bringing
me home a half an hour early.</i>

835
01:02:38,237 --> 01:02:40,780
<i>OK, Daddy. 5:30.</i>

836
01:02:40,781 --> 01:02:43,450
<i>He says to be there in the lobby at 5:30.</i>

837
01:02:43,451 --> 01:02:45,744
<i>- Don't fall asleep again, Mommy.</i>
- OK.

838
01:02:45,745 --> 01:02:48,496
<i>I gotta go.
I'm getting chocolate cake.</i>

839
01:02:48,497 --> 01:02:50,248
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

840
01:02:50,249 --> 01:02:53,001
<i>Dahlia, where have you been?
I left two messages.</i>

841
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:55,462
I lost a day, Mary.

842
01:02:55,463 --> 01:03:00,717
I took a pill, just one pill,
and it knocked me out for 24 hours.

843
01:03:00,718 --> 01:03:02,636
That's never happened before.

844
01:03:02,637 --> 01:03:08,183
And I'm tired, really tired.
It's like I haven't slept at all.

845
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:12,270
<i>Dahlia, are you OK?
Are you really OK?</i>

846
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:15,982
My headache's gone.
But the leak is back.

847
01:03:15,983 --> 01:03:20,595
<i>It's back?
I thought they were gonna fix that thing.</i>

848
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,657
<i>- Dahlia?</i>
- Yeah?

849
01:03:23,658 --> 01:03:28,478
<i>- Are you OK?</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine.

850
01:03:28,788 --> 01:03:32,248
<i>You have five
new messages. First new message.</i>

851
01:03:32,249 --> 01:03:35,460
<i>Long nap, huh? Call me.</i>

852
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:37,921
<i>Message erased.
Next message.</i>

853
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:41,591
<i>Hi, Jeff Platzer here. I got the
preliminaries from your husband's lawyer</i>

854
01:03:41,592 --> 01:03:45,011
<i>and I need to touch base with you about
his accusations as soon as possible.</i>

855
01:03:45,012 --> 01:03:48,515
<i>Believe it or not I'm actually available
on Sunday afternoon until five.</i>

856
01:03:48,516 --> 01:03:52,377
<i>If you are, would you call my cell?
OK. Bye.</i>

857
01:04:01,445 --> 01:04:03,613
<i>- </i> Mrs. Williams?
- Yeah.

858
01:04:03,614 --> 01:04:06,241
Hi.
I'm your lawyer.

859
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:09,060
- Hi.
- Hi.

860
01:04:09,662 --> 01:04:12,080
- I'm sorry it's such a mess.
- No, it's OK.

861
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:15,542
I just moved into a new office
and they've painted it.

862
01:04:15,543 --> 01:04:18,569
I can't stand the smell
so I'm improvising.

863
01:04:19,296 --> 01:04:21,781
OK.

864
01:04:26,053 --> 01:04:29,514
- Hi.
- Hi.

865
01:04:29,515 --> 01:04:33,376
- So...
- OK.

866
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:37,647
Your husband's claiming
you're mentally unstable

867
01:04:37,648 --> 01:04:40,316
because your father
was physically abusive

868
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:44,070
and your mother was an alcoholic
who abandoned you.

869
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:46,597
That's...

870
01:04:48,075 --> 01:04:50,452
unbelievable.

871
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:52,818
What do my parents
have to do with this?

872
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:54,664
That's my question exactly.

873
01:04:54,665 --> 01:04:59,544
What's more relevant is that your husband
says you suffer from crippling migraines

874
01:04:59,545 --> 01:05:01,838
and paranoid delusions.

875
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,298
He says he'll submit school reports

876
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:06,926
that show your daughter
is beginning to share your fantasy life.

877
01:05:06,927 --> 01:05:08,511
"Cecilia is now having trouble

878
01:05:08,512 --> 01:05:11,014
distinguishing between
what is real and what is not."

879
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:13,016
It's a lie. It's a lie.

880
01:05:13,017 --> 01:05:16,019
In child custody briefs, it's standard
to make these kinds of accusations.

881
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,520
Don't take it too seriously.

882
01:05:17,521 --> 01:05:21,649
But I do need to know what, if anything,
in your husband's narrative

883
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:27,197
has some semblance, some shred of fact
that he might produce in court.

884
01:05:27,198 --> 01:05:31,618
Well, I get migraines.
Yeah. That's true.

885
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:35,997
But they've never interfered
with my ability to do anything.

886
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,340
You can talk to my doctor about that.

887
01:05:38,342 --> 01:05:41,544
He'll tell you they've
certainly never crippled me.

888
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:43,171
Um...

889
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:48,301
As for Ceci, I think
she's a little bit lonely right now.

890
01:05:48,302 --> 01:05:51,596
Her father's abandoned her and she was
forced to move from her neighborhood.

891
01:05:51,597 --> 01:05:54,099
So...

892
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:59,170
she's developed an imaginary friend.
But that's normal.

893
01:06:00,397 --> 01:06:02,817
That's fine.
But for future reference,

894
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:05,610
when you're talking to,
for example, a judge,

895
01:06:05,611 --> 01:06:08,363
I would stay away from phrases like,
"her father's abandoned her."

896
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:11,533
It's important, when the other side
is being so melodramatic,

897
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:15,036
- to sound like we're the sane ones.
- Right.

898
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:18,147
- That's all I'm saying.
- OK.

899
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:40,419
- I'd like to notch that.
- Oh, yeah, man.

900
01:06:47,611 --> 01:06:50,263
Hey, sweetheart.

901
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,117
- Mommy?
- Yeah.

902
01:06:54,118 --> 01:06:57,662
- Look what Daddy gave me.
- Wow.

903
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:02,750
- That's great, You're so lucky.
- Listen, next Saturday's a problem.

904
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:04,836
Can we do Sunday and I'll bring her
first thing in the morning

905
01:07:04,837 --> 01:07:07,172
for school on Monday?

906
01:07:07,173 --> 01:07:10,449
Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.

907
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:15,346
- Come on, honey. Say bye to Daddy.
- Bye, Daddy. Thanks for the Barbie.

908
01:07:15,347 --> 01:07:18,183
- Did you do that ponytail by yourself?
- Yeah.

909
01:07:18,184 --> 01:07:21,085
- It's a good one.
- Thanks.

910
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:29,135
- I like the collar.
- Thanks.

911
01:07:33,532 --> 01:07:36,159
Honey, you know what,
I forgot to do something.

912
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,453
I'm gonna be right back.
Will you wait right here for me?

913
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,663
- Don't go anywhere, OK?
- OK.

914
01:07:40,664 --> 01:07:41,789
Be right back.

915
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:45,901
Two... one.

916
01:08:20,412 --> 01:08:22,772
Ceci?

917
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:27,860
Ceci? Stay in the elevator.
I'm bringing you down.

918
01:08:30,297 --> 01:08:32,823
Ceci, can you hear me?

919
01:08:37,721 --> 01:08:42,600
Bake me a cake as fast as you can.
Roll it, pat it and mark it with a B.

920
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:45,071
No more pretending
to play with Natasha.

921
01:08:45,073 --> 01:08:46,396
She won't let me.

922
01:08:46,397 --> 01:08:50,108
Well, then you stop talking to her.
You tell her I said so.

923
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:53,319
You tell her your mommy said
you can't play with her anymore.

924
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,013
OK, Mommy.

925
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:02,704
<i>- Hello?
- </i> Hi, Mr. Platzer.

926
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,832
I'm sorry to call you late,
but I think my husband...

927
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:07,917
<i>Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night.
I can't talk.</i>

928
01:09:07,918 --> 01:09:12,046
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I just need
to tell you this as soon as possible.

929
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,257
I think my husband
is trying to drive me crazy.

930
01:09:14,258 --> 01:09:16,301
Either that or he's hoping
that I'm gonna act crazy.

931
01:09:16,302 --> 01:09:20,454
<i>- Hang on. Let me call you right back.</i>
- OK.

932
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:24,100
You say neither of the Rimskys
are living there?

933
01:09:24,101 --> 01:09:26,519
<i>No, no one's there.
So Kyle's paying these kids.</i>

934
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,313
<i>I mean,
he must be paying these kids</i>

935
01:09:28,314 --> 01:09:31,274
<i>to mess around with the water
and the backpack. And the elevator.</i>

936
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:34,902
<i>I went into the elevator the other day
and the buttons were burned off.</i>

937
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:38,072
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night
and I'm at the movies with my family.

938
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:42,076
If I don't want to be handling
my own divorce, I gotta get back. So...

939
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,412
I'll call you tomorrow
and we'll sort this out. All right?

940
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,272
<i>Yeah.
Absolutely.</i>

941
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:54,363
<i>Get down!</i>

942
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:21,532
This time make sure
you put it in the garbage truck.

943
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:23,785
- Where did you...
- Those kids have been playing games,

944
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:25,453
moving it around the building.

945
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:29,791
And they were upstairs again so now
there's water all over my bedroom floor.

946
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,959
- They're running the water again?
- Mm-hm.

947
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,087
I thought you were gonna
change the lock on 10F.

948
01:10:34,088 --> 01:10:37,632
Murray didn't authorize it.
He has to send me a 112B form.

949
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:41,469
- Look, is the plumber here yet?
- No, no. It's only 8:15.

950
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,812
OK, look. I left a message for Mr.
Murray.

951
01:10:43,814 --> 01:10:46,099
I told him I need my
problem fixed first.

952
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,851
So when the plumber gets here,
send him up to my apartment

953
01:10:48,852 --> 01:10:53,339
or you and Murray
can both talk to my lawyer. OK?

954
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,163
Do you remember
what we talked about last night?

955
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:12,733
- Yes, Mommy.
- OK.

956
01:11:15,379 --> 01:11:17,130
See you later, OK?

957
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:18,798
Hello.

958
01:11:18,799 --> 01:11:21,551
<i>- Hi. Jeff Platzer here.</i>
- Hi, Mr. Platzer.

959
01:11:21,552 --> 01:11:23,511
Listen, I did a little homework on Rimsky

960
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:25,331
and I think I turned up
the missing mother

961
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:26,431
in a hospital in San Diego.

962
01:11:26,432 --> 01:11:27,640
<i>Why are you looking for her?</i>

963
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:29,452
I figured the Rimskys
might want to know

964
01:11:29,454 --> 01:11:31,352
their apartment's being
used by strangers.

965
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:34,480
Mrs. Williams, we're never gonna prove
your husband's behind this harassment.

966
01:11:34,481 --> 01:11:38,734
And trying to do that is just playing
his game. He wants you to look paranoid.

967
01:11:38,735 --> 01:11:40,945
<i>We gotta deal with this straight,
as if it's all on the level.</i>

968
01:11:40,946 --> 01:11:43,322
<i>So that's what we'll do,
we'll play it straight.</i>

969
01:11:43,323 --> 01:11:45,867
I'm due in court, I'll call you
when I get ahold of Mrs. Rimsky.

970
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,786
In the meantime, just sit tight.

971
01:11:48,787 --> 01:11:51,414
<i>- I will. Thanks so much.</i>
- OK.

972
01:11:51,415 --> 01:11:53,708
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

973
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:57,420
- Abigail's making a storm, sweetheart.
- Done!

974
01:11:57,421 --> 01:11:59,474
Done? You remember
you have to sign your name

975
01:11:59,476 --> 01:12:00,590
so you know whose it is.

976
01:12:00,591 --> 01:12:04,969
You don't want me to take that home
and say I did it, do you?

977
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:08,247
I like that.
Pirates?

978
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,251
Stop it.

979
01:12:13,145 --> 01:12:15,563
Stop it, I told you,
leave me alone.

980
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:18,257
- We've got rainbows...
- Stop it!

981
01:12:18,442 --> 01:12:21,152
Stop it!

982
01:12:21,153 --> 01:12:23,529
Stop it!

983
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,015
Stop it!

984
01:12:30,787 --> 01:12:32,497
You're gonna get cleaned up
and when you're done

985
01:12:32,498 --> 01:12:36,667
you're gonna come back and sit with me
and we'll read a story together.

986
01:12:36,668 --> 01:12:40,362
Then maybe we'll talk about your friend.

987
01:12:42,674 --> 01:12:45,618
Go on.

988
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:15,814
Ceci!

989
01:13:19,253 --> 01:13:22,321
Go away!

990
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:47,071
- Where is she?
- She passed out in the bathroom.

991
01:13:47,072 --> 01:13:49,532
We don't know what happened.
There was water all over the place.

992
01:13:49,533 --> 01:13:51,200
- We took her to the hospital.
- Hospital?

993
01:13:51,201 --> 01:13:52,254
We just wanted to check her out.

994
01:13:52,256 --> 01:13:53,803
It's school policy.
We couldn't reach you.

995
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:56,956
I had an emergency at work,
I didn't get my messages for 2 hours.

996
01:13:56,957 --> 01:13:59,292
It's allright. We called her father
and he's gonna meet her at the hospital.

997
01:13:59,293 --> 01:14:03,004
- OK. Which hospital?
- It's the one right here on the island.

998
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:05,715
<i>Kyle took her.
They released her and he took her.</i>

999
01:14:05,716 --> 01:14:07,006
<i>Did they say what was wrong?</i>

1000
01:14:07,008 --> 01:14:09,318
They said, you know,
it's nothing serious.

1001
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:11,012
She fainted but...

1002
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:16,017
I'm trying to find him. I called his home
number, I called his cell phone number,

1003
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:18,603
I called his office number,
and he's avoiding me

1004
01:14:18,604 --> 01:14:21,397
so I need to know what to do.
Can I go to his apartment?

1005
01:14:21,398 --> 01:14:24,358
Mrs. Williams, I need you to calm down.
I need it, your daughter needs it.

1006
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,735
Just calm down, OK?

1007
01:14:25,736 --> 01:14:28,070
<i>I'm sorry. I know you don't know me,
but you have to believe me.</i>

1008
01:14:28,071 --> 01:14:30,323
I'm not crazy, I'm really not.

1009
01:14:30,324 --> 01:14:32,158
<i>- I believe you, Mrs. Williams.</i>
- I'm really not.

1010
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:36,162
Just go home. Your husband and your
daughter are probably waiting for you.

1011
01:14:36,163 --> 01:14:39,064
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1012
01:14:40,584 --> 01:14:42,651
Ceci.

1013
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,946
Ceci.

1014
01:14:49,259 --> 01:14:52,803
<i>- No new messages.</i>
- Oh, God.

1015
01:14:52,804 --> 01:14:54,722
Hello?

1016
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:58,059
<i>- Hello? It's Jeff. Are they there?</i>
- No.

1017
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:02,605
<i>- They're not there?</i>
- No. There's no message.

1018
01:15:02,606 --> 01:15:05,066
There's water everywhere.

1019
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:09,153
<i>Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Williams, calm down.
Calm down.</i>

1020
01:15:09,154 --> 01:15:11,656
- She can't be here.
<i>- What do you want me to do?</i>

1021
01:15:11,657 --> 01:15:13,783
Oh, God.

1022
01:15:13,784 --> 01:15:18,228
I can't be her mother,
I don't know how to be myself.

1023
01:15:18,789 --> 01:15:21,231
Ceci!

1024
01:15:28,674 --> 01:15:32,677
<i>I hate you.
Get away from me, you little bitch.</i>

1025
01:15:32,678 --> 01:15:34,929
<i>I hate you.</i>

1026
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,097
Fuck!

1027
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:39,600
I hate you!
I hate you!

1028
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:42,127
Bitch!

1029
01:15:52,197 --> 01:15:54,448
Sorry about this.
I really had no idea.

1030
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:57,267
I would've come down myself
a long time ago.

1031
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:15,536
Better open it.

1032
01:16:17,264 --> 01:16:19,724
Hello?

1033
01:16:19,725 --> 01:16:22,417
Hello?

1034
01:16:25,731 --> 01:16:28,298
Jesus.

1035
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:34,280
Look at this. This is appalling.
This is appalling.

1036
01:16:34,281 --> 01:16:35,544
The plumber's on his way.

1037
01:16:35,546 --> 01:16:38,576
I'm paying him double overtime
so he can get here tonight.

1038
01:16:38,577 --> 01:16:41,145
Hello?

1039
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:46,108
- I'll get some of these lights on.
- Mrs. Williams?

1040
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:51,172
- You OK?
- I'm awake.

1041
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:53,949
The plumber will be here in 15 minutes.

1042
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:55,395
Mr. Murray?

1043
01:16:55,397 --> 01:16:57,553
This is just a big
misunderstanding. OK?

1044
01:16:57,554 --> 01:17:00,765
Mr. Veeck did not keep me informed.
This will be fixed tonight.

1045
01:17:00,766 --> 01:17:04,435
- Or she's staying at the Plaza, right?
- It will definitely be fixed tonight.

1046
01:17:04,436 --> 01:17:07,588
- And I want to talk to Veeck.
- I will get him.

1047
01:17:11,318 --> 01:17:13,486
You OK?

1048
01:17:13,487 --> 01:17:17,556
- Migraine, huh?
- Yeah.

1049
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:24,246
- I'll keep my voice low.
- Thanks.

1050
01:17:24,247 --> 01:17:27,082
I spoke with your husband's lawyer
and Ceci's fine.

1051
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,460
Kyle will bring her to
school in the morning.

1052
01:17:29,461 --> 01:17:31,212
OK.

1053
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:34,298
Now, this part is gonna piss you off.

1054
01:17:34,299 --> 01:17:37,259
They want Ceci to see a psychologist
to be evaluated.

1055
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:43,098
There's nothing we can do about that
but say yes. So we're saying yes.

1056
01:17:43,099 --> 01:17:45,918
OK.

1057
01:17:47,354 --> 01:17:50,105
- Here we are.
- Mr. Veeck.

1058
01:17:50,106 --> 01:17:52,233
I had an interesting conversation
with Mrs. Rimsky today.

1059
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:55,236
She was very surprised to hear
her daughter isn't living upstairs.

1060
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:57,988
- In 10F?
- Mm-hm.

1061
01:17:57,989 --> 01:18:00,991
- You said they left together.
- That's what the Russian said.

1062
01:18:00,992 --> 01:18:04,078
No, she left without her daughter. She
didn't think she could take care of her.

1063
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:06,539
Mrs. Rimsky's an alcoholic.
She claimed she was going for treatment,

1064
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,291
and had to leave the girl behind
with the father.

1065
01:18:09,292 --> 01:18:11,902
You knew that, didn't you?

1066
01:18:12,045 --> 01:18:15,130
Only Mr. Rimsky didn't take
Natasha with him.

1067
01:18:15,131 --> 01:18:17,091
I spoke with Grandma Rimsky
in Moscow today

1068
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,718
and she said her son
is living with her alone.

1069
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:23,722
- So he lied to me. What do I know?
- You had to know.

1070
01:18:23,723 --> 01:18:25,633
Well, we'll find out tomorrow.

1071
01:18:25,635 --> 01:18:28,435
I have a phone appointment with Mr.
Rimsky.

1072
01:18:28,436 --> 01:18:30,441
Why did you lie about
the little girl?

1073
01:18:30,443 --> 01:18:32,857
I didn't want to get
involved, that's all.

1074
01:18:32,858 --> 01:18:36,218
Did you see Natasha
after her mother left?

1075
01:18:39,072 --> 01:18:41,574
It's a simple question, Veeck.

1076
01:18:41,575 --> 01:18:44,359
Yeah. I see her.
I see her that afternoon.

1077
01:18:44,361 --> 01:18:46,495
I see her playing on the stairs.

1078
01:18:46,496 --> 01:18:50,155
Then the next day the father
tells me she leave with the mother.

1079
01:18:50,157 --> 01:18:51,375
I ask no questions.

1080
01:18:51,376 --> 01:18:53,803
Well, if he killed her,
it's not my business.

1081
01:18:53,805 --> 01:18:54,753
"Killed her"?

1082
01:18:54,754 --> 01:18:57,398
"If he killed her"?

1083
01:18:58,884 --> 01:19:00,801
Plumber!

1084
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:04,788
You got a lot more than a leak to fix,
Mr. Murray.

1085
01:19:05,432 --> 01:19:07,916
Mr. Veeck.

1086
01:19:09,603 --> 01:19:13,772
- If you could just...
- Come on in, just right inside.

1087
01:19:13,773 --> 01:19:16,383
Thank you.

1088
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:19,236
Some kind of pipe or something.

1089
01:19:19,237 --> 01:19:21,162
Yeah, well, see, that
is a brand-new pipe.

1090
01:19:21,164 --> 01:19:22,907
So, this will all be patched tomorrow.

1091
01:19:22,908 --> 01:19:25,784
- By professionals.
- By professionals. Good as new.

1092
01:19:25,785 --> 01:19:30,789
It better be. I'm calling NYPD
to report a child is missing.

1093
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:35,044
OK. I mean, I'm sure there's
a simple explanation for that, but...

1094
01:19:35,045 --> 01:19:40,824
So, goodnight.
And, again, I am so sorry about all this.

1095
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:44,828
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1096
01:19:45,388 --> 01:19:48,874
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

1097
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:50,841
You sure?

1098
01:19:50,843 --> 01:19:54,313
Yeah, I'm feeling
much better, actually.

1099
01:19:54,314 --> 01:19:57,716
- I gotta go. Family.
- OK. Mm.

1100
01:19:58,318 --> 01:20:02,404
I'll keep my cell on all night
and if you need me just call.

1101
01:20:02,405 --> 01:20:05,057
- Any hour.
- Thanks.

1102
01:20:05,659 --> 01:20:08,727
- Thanks again. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

1103
01:20:20,507 --> 01:20:23,617
She left you behind.

1104
01:20:24,636 --> 01:20:28,080
They both left you behind.

1105
01:20:28,848 --> 01:20:32,876
<i>Help me.</i>

1106
01:21:04,217 --> 01:21:06,660
Wait!

1107
01:22:46,653 --> 01:22:49,655
I told Murray,
I told him a million times.

1108
01:22:49,656 --> 01:22:53,600
It's not my job.
I'm not a goddamn plumber.

1109
01:23:01,751 --> 01:23:04,044
How you feeling?
You OK?

1110
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:06,213
- You warmed up?
- I'm OK.

1111
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:10,968
Cops think Veeck probably left the
tank open and somehow she fell in.

1112
01:23:10,969 --> 01:23:14,054
They even think he might have discovered
she'd fallen in weeks ago.

1113
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:17,057
That's why he hadn't
cleaned it in so long.

1114
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:19,518
They might have enough to charge him
with criminal negligence.

1115
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:22,747
They'd arrest the parents,
but they're out of state

1116
01:23:22,749 --> 01:23:24,857
and there are no witnesses, so...

1117
01:23:24,858 --> 01:23:29,970
The truth is, they'll probably
never know what happened.

1118
01:23:30,613 --> 01:23:33,682
Her mother left her.

1119
01:23:34,617 --> 01:23:37,936
The father assumed
that she was with her mom,

1120
01:23:38,538 --> 01:23:42,941
and the mother assumed
she was with her father.

1121
01:23:46,796 --> 01:23:49,423
Guess everyone just assumed.

1122
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:52,342
No one really cared what happened to her.

1123
01:23:52,343 --> 01:23:55,745
That's what it looks like.

1124
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,436
I'll tell Mary you've been a prince.

1125
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:04,521
You just accomplished the impossible,
Mrs. Williams.

1126
01:24:04,522 --> 01:24:08,550
You actually made me glad
I went to law school.

1127
01:24:13,156 --> 01:24:15,932
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

1128
01:24:16,534 --> 01:24:18,702
I can probably get you
a year's free rent out of Murray.

1129
01:24:18,703 --> 01:24:21,705
Oh!
No, it's OK.

1130
01:24:21,706 --> 01:24:23,916
I'm moving.

1131
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:27,569
- Call me in the morning, OK?
- Yeah.

1132
01:24:44,354 --> 01:24:46,480
- Come on, princess.
- Bye, Daddy.

1133
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:49,174
Bye.

1134
01:24:57,784 --> 01:24:59,284
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

1135
01:24:59,285 --> 01:25:01,936
Yeah?

1136
01:25:04,916 --> 01:25:08,741
OK. I'll be here after school
to pick you up.

1137
01:25:08,743 --> 01:25:10,571
See you after school.

1138
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:17,827
- Hey.
- Hi.

1139
01:25:18,429 --> 01:25:20,973
Thank you for taking care
of Ceci yesterday.

1140
01:25:20,974 --> 01:25:25,143
It's OK. I'm really worried
about her mental state.

1141
01:25:25,144 --> 01:25:27,646
- I am too.
- You are?

1142
01:25:27,647 --> 01:25:29,606
Yeah.

1143
01:25:29,607 --> 01:25:33,151
So, I've been thinking...

1144
01:25:33,152 --> 01:25:36,321
I don't want her
to have to choose between us.

1145
01:25:36,322 --> 01:25:37,330
What do you mean?

1146
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:40,117
I want to look for a
place in Jersey City

1147
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:43,245
so that shared custody
will be easier for both of us.

1148
01:25:43,246 --> 01:25:46,915
And we can do, you know,
one week with me, and one week with you.

1149
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:50,402
Or maybe split the week.
We can see what works best.

1150
01:25:50,753 --> 01:25:55,465
- You serious?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1151
01:25:55,466 --> 01:26:00,220
Hey, you know, you were right about the
school here. I checked it out. It's good.

1152
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:03,390
- Maybe I could get a place...
- No, it's fine.

1153
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:08,211
After this, we'll get a...
a place in Jersey City.

1154
01:26:14,902 --> 01:26:17,429
I'll see you later.

1155
01:26:23,161 --> 01:26:26,830
- When are we moving?
- Not until next week, sweetheart.

1156
01:26:26,831 --> 01:26:31,585
This is winter stuff though
so we can pack it up now.

1157
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:35,071
You OK?
Are you feeling OK?

1158
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:50,312
What are you thinking about?

1159
01:26:50,313 --> 01:26:53,882
Why did her mommy forget about her?

1160
01:27:05,036 --> 01:27:07,937
Do you know how much I love you?

1161
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:13,502
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

1162
01:27:13,503 --> 01:27:16,774
Do you know I would do
anything for you?

1163
01:27:16,776 --> 01:27:17,865
Yes.

1164
01:27:18,674 --> 01:27:21,134
That's a promise.

1165
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:25,538
- Honey, do you want bubbles tonight?
- Uh-huh.

1166
01:27:29,102 --> 01:27:30,435
There you are.

1167
01:27:30,436 --> 01:27:32,156
<i>That's so great, Dahlia.</i>

1168
01:27:32,158 --> 01:27:35,524
Well, I think it's gonna be for the best.

1169
01:27:35,525 --> 01:27:38,985
And moving out of here,
that is definitely for the best.

1170
01:27:38,986 --> 01:27:43,031
What do you want to do?
Be a chef? OK.

1171
01:27:43,032 --> 01:27:46,601
Let's see if we
can make you a chef hat.

1172
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,248
There.

1173
01:27:51,249 --> 01:27:54,484
Now, what are you going to cook?

1174
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:57,421
Mac and cheese?

1175
01:27:57,422 --> 01:28:00,841
Look, I should go get Ceci out of the tub
before she turns into a prune.

1176
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,301
<i>- She's so cute.</i>
- So... Oh!

1177
01:28:03,302 --> 01:28:06,596
Here she is now.
Yeah. So I will talk to you tomorrow.

1178
01:28:06,597 --> 01:28:08,140
<i>- OK. Take care. Bye.</i>
- OK. You too.

1179
01:28:08,141 --> 01:28:09,433
Goodnight.

1180
01:28:09,434 --> 01:28:14,337
- Mommy, can you read me a story?
- Course I can, honey.

1181
01:28:18,943 --> 01:28:22,178
Let's see which one you picked.

1182
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:37,861
We haven't read this one
in a long time, have we?

1183
01:28:39,422 --> 01:28:44,968
"There were once a man and a woman
who had long in vain wished for a child."

1184
01:28:44,969 --> 01:28:48,246
We need more snow,
don't you think?

1185
01:28:48,848 --> 01:28:51,749
Then let's get some more snow.

1186
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:59,465
...beautiful Rapunzel.

1187
01:29:11,621 --> 01:29:15,457
Don't leave me.
I want you to be my mommy.

1188
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:18,168
- Don't leave me.
- Ceci!

1189
01:29:18,169 --> 01:29:21,070
You can't leave me.

1190
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:25,634
Ceci!

1191
01:29:25,635 --> 01:29:27,886
Ceci!

1192
01:29:27,887 --> 01:29:29,638
Ceci!

1193
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:31,915
Ceci!

1194
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:36,836
Ceci!

1195
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:40,131
No!

1196
01:29:41,108 --> 01:29:43,468
Ceci!

1197
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:51,618
Ceci!

1198
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:53,227
Ceci!

1199
01:29:54,121 --> 01:29:56,206
Oh, God.

1200
01:29:56,207 --> 01:29:59,943
Let her go!
You let her go!

1201
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:07,075
No!

1202
01:30:22,024 --> 01:30:24,442
No!
Please!

1203
01:30:24,443 --> 01:30:28,554
Natasha!
Let her go! Please.

1204
01:30:29,156 --> 01:30:32,475
We'll stay.
We'll stay here with you.

1205
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:37,355
What do you want?

1206
01:30:38,165 --> 01:30:40,834
I'll be your mother.

1207
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:43,486
- Please.
- Forever?

1208
01:30:45,756 --> 01:30:48,341
Forever.

1209
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:50,594
Forever. Yes.

1210
01:30:50,595 --> 01:30:53,972
I'll be your mother forever.

1211
01:30:53,973 --> 01:30:57,375
Take me.
Please, take me.

1212
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:06,169
<i>Yeah, OK. So we got
an 11-46, Caucasian female, aged 30,</i>

1213
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:09,589
<i>no apparent cause of death,
and a six-year-old girl with shock.</i>

1214
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:12,116
<i>Trying to locate the father.</i>

1215
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:26,422
Ceci.

1216
01:33:04,895 --> 01:33:09,841
Let's go home, honey.
Would you get the door?

1217
01:33:50,816 --> 01:33:54,819
<i>We did a whole bunch of them.
A whole neighborhood.</i>

1218
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:57,405
<i>What was this one about?
Do you remember?</i>

1219
01:33:57,406 --> 01:34:00,575
That was me and then that was you.

1220
01:34:00,576 --> 01:34:04,162
- That was a tree.
- A tree.

1221
01:34:04,163 --> 01:34:10,463
- And then that's a little angel.
- Beautiful gold wings on the angel.

1222
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:35,635
Come on.

1223
01:34:37,446 --> 01:34:40,431
OK, honey, let's walk.

1224
01:34:42,326 --> 01:34:45,478
What's wrong with you?

1225
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:52,068
Come on.

1226
01:34:56,048 --> 01:34:57,465
Ceci.

1227
01:34:57,466 --> 01:34:59,217
Ceci?

1228
01:34:59,218 --> 01:35:00,218
Ceci?

1229
01:35:00,219 --> 01:35:02,637
Open the door.
Push the button, Ceci.

1230
01:35:02,638 --> 01:35:05,957
Open it.
Open the door. Ceci!

1231
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:37,530
My beautiful girl.

1232
01:35:48,684 --> 01:35:51,669
Whenever you need me, I'm here.

1233
01:35:54,773 --> 01:35:57,967
OK, Daddy.
Let's go.
