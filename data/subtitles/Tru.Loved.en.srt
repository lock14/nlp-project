1
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,982
Gertrude, I just wanted
to welcome you

2
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,083
to Walt Whitman High.

3
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,924
You let me know
if there's anything you need.

4
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,291
Thanks, Mr. Bushnell.

5
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,457
And it's "Tru."
Just Tru.

6
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,365
Oh. Okay, Tru.

7
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,029
Good luck.

8
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:46,730
Yeah.

9
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,864
Sorry.

10
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,568
Watch where you're going, freak.

11
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,306
Isn't she new?

12
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,074
Yeah. She probably got kicked out
of her last school.

13
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,209
I think she looks like a dyke.

14
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,809
Well, yeah,
if she's trying to impress boys,

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,184
and that's the best she can do,

16
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,189
it's just sad.

17
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,384
Very sad.

18
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,355
Tru? Hello? Tru!

19
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,497
Hello!
I asked you how your day was.

20
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,498
Hell on Earth. The usual.

21
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,299
Well, do the teachers seem good?

22
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,065
I guess.

23
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,403
Any potential buddies?

24
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,407
Nope.

25
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,569
Glasses over there.

26
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,579
You're still furious about the move.

27
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,149
Yup.

28
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,309
Oh, honey, we had to move here.

29
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,444
This job was much too good
for Lisa to pass up.

30
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,352
I mean, she's going to be
designing houses,

31
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:14,051
not spending months
on those silly condo conversions.

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,685
Well, I'm so glad she's happy.

33
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:20,391
Making yourself and us miserable
is not gonna improve the situation.

34
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,564
Isn't it my prerogative as a teenager?

35
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,041
Okay!

36
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:36,912
That was pretty good...
for a group of pansies!

37
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,042
Give me four laps,
then hit the showers!

38
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,677
Move it!

39
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,215
I'm a frigging receiver.
What do I gotta run for?

40
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,851
I already ran 20 laps
before practice even started.

41
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,055
I think it's something
about shared pain and team spirit.

42
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,394
I got team spirit coming out my ass.
I ain't gotta run.

43
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,524
I have to save my energy.
I have a hot date tonight.

44
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,192
Tiffany?

45
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:56,996
No. Rhonda.

46
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,661
But I thought Rhonda
was going out with Joe?

47
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,102
She was.

48
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,498
Man, you're incredible!
How do you get away with this shit?

49
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,607
It's all charm, baby...
and a big dick.

50
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,308
You try that line on somebody
who hasn't seen you in the shower.

51
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,213
Okay, I may not be
the biggest man on campus,

52
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,410
but I sure get laid the most.

53
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,181
Or at least talk about it the most.

54
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,789
When was the last time
you got laid?

55
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,019
- None of your business.
- Exactly. A long time.

56
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,322
Man, whatever.

57
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,487
Man, fuck you.

58
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,622
You'd probably like that,
wouldn't you?

59
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,461
Oww!

60
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,810
I heard her mom's a dyke,
which explains a lot.

61
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,109
What about her dad?

62
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,708
Probably a dyke, too.

63
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,446
A dad can't be a dyke, stupid.

64
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,114
I don't think she has a dad.
Just two moms.

65
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,954
All right, that's just weird.

66
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,526
No. Two women?
That's hot.

67
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,492
Ugh!

68
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,119
You're so gross.

69
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,664
Come on, I feel sorry for her.

70
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,458
That's got to be hard.

71
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,693
Nobody makes her dress
like a freak.

72
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,667
Mm-mm.

73
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,295
She should make an effort.

74
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,703
I think she's kinda cute.

75
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,168
She is so not cute.

76
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,043
I am not I, if there be such an I.

77
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,346
Or those eyes shut
that make thee answer "I."

78
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,650
If he be slain, say "I,"
or if not, "No."

79
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,884
Brief sounds determine
of my weal or woe.

80
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,120
I saw the wound.

81
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,321
I saw it with mine eyes.

82
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,991
God save the mark!

83
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,197
Here... on his manly breast.

84
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,831
I don't get it.

85
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,236
What don't you get?

86
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,675
Why do the Capulets and Montagues
hate each other so much?

87
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:49,714
- What's their beef?
- Anyone? Class?

88
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,478
Tru, why do you think
the Montagues and Capulets

89
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,984
hated each other so much?

90
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:58,046
Um, it wasn't ethnic or religious,
so my guess would be economic.

91
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,091
They were probably
in competition for something.

92
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,251
Servants.

93
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,352
Good help is so hard to find!

94
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,764
Tru has got a good point.

95
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,458
While there were many reasons
for families to feud...

96
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,728
<i>Attention, students.</i>

97
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,532
<i>Mrs. Lewis will be holding auditions</i>
<i>for</i> West Side Story

98
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,505
<i>in the auditorium this afternoon</i>
<i>immediately following classes.</i>

99
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,474
Remember! Act 4!
Tomorrow!

100
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,316
Hey, so you gonna audition?

101
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,418
I can't sing.

102
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,248
Well, neither could Natalie Wood.

103
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,518
I don't think Walt Whitman High
is gonna let me lip sync.

104
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,559
You've seen it, right?

105
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,458
Just the movie,
which is completely amazing.

106
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,031
Yeah. I think it came out
before my mom was born,

107
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,964
but it totally holds up.

108
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,760
Um, so what about you?
Are you gonna audition?

109
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,999
Oh, no, I can't. Football.

110
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,597
Right.

111
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,477
I gotta get to my next class.

112
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,945
Oh, yeah. Right.
Sorry. Um...

113
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,983
Hey! Do you wanna
do something sometime?

114
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,955
Like, how about a movie...
tomorrow night?

115
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,654
Okay.

116
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,749
Okay.

117
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,035
Where you going, baby boy?

118
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,504
Out.

119
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,201
Oh, that little white girl, huh?

120
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,178
Okay, her name is Tru.

121
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,838
Tru? What kind of name is Tru?

122
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,111
It's short for Gertrude.
As in Stein.

123
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,311
She was a writer.

124
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:39,755
I know who Gertrude Stein was.

125
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:44,660
A rose is a rose is a rose.

126
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,629
Yeah, whatever. I gotta go.

127
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,463
I don't know why you can't date
a nice black girl.

128
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,498
I know they got plenty of black girls
over at that school you go to.

129
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,872
Mm-hmm. And Asian and Hispanic.
You know, it's practically the U.N.

130
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:04,380
Good. Then you can find
a nice black girl to date.

131
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,415
Oh, Gran.

132
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,749
Now, you see, that is your fault.

133
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,254
You are just too pretty.

134
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,119
You have spoiled me
for all other black women.

135
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,126
You little charmer.

136
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,695
Get out of here.

137
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,390
No sense in keeping her waiting.

138
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,933
White girls ain't got no patience.

139
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,443
So, what'd you think?

140
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,106
It was good. Funny.

141
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,683
Nah. The book was better.

142
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,308
You read the book?

143
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,320
It is possible to play football
and not be a total moron.

144
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,720
Sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

145
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,326
So, how are you enjoying
our fair city so far?

146
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,966
Agoura Heights is not a city.

147
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,466
But it's okay, I guess.

148
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,336
I mean, it just sucks having
to leave behind all my old friends,

149
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,600
you know?

150
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,903
We talk, we text,
but it's not the same.

151
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,341
And I guess Walt Whitman
hasn't exactly welcomed you

152
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,640
with open arms, right?

153
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,281
So far, you're the only one
who'll even talk to me.

154
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,284
I think everyone else
looks at me and sees... freak.

155
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,684
No, I think your look is tight.

156
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,614
Tight? No.
Uptight maybe.

157
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,125
You're gonna contradict a happening
young brother like myself?

158
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,327
I wouldn't dream of it.

159
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,767
So, okay.

160
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,603
I heard you have, like, two moms.

161
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,473
Is that right?

162
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,308
Yes.

163
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,341
What's that like?

164
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,545
It's normal for me.

165
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,086
Yeah, but you've never had,
you know, like a dad?

166
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,987
No, I have two, actually.
Back in San Francisco.

167
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:30,959
Okay, I got a B-plus in Biology.
You can't really have two dads.

168
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,066
Emmett is my biological father,
and Dom is his partner.

169
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:39,729
Wow. My parents are just divorced.
Pretty simple.

170
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,864
I know we're not exactly
the Brady Bunch,

171
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,740
but it's worked okay for us so far.

172
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,142
Thanks for the ride.

173
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,947
One of these days
I'm gonna get my license.

174
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,614
Oh, you're not out of my way.

175
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,355
I had a really good time tonight.

176
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,124
Yeah. Me, too.

177
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,764
So, I'll see you at school tomorrow.

178
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,239
Yeah. I'll... I'll see you tomorrow.

179
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,389
How was it?

180
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,025
Uh, it was funny.
Not as good as the book.

181
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,751
Uh, not the movie.

182
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,190
The date.

183
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,888
It wasn't a date.

184
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,397
When a boy asks you out
and you go, it's a date.

185
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,365
He's just being nice 'cause I'm new.

186
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,901
Did he kiss you?

187
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,628
Mom!

188
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,638
Oh. Sorry. Unfair question.

189
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,641
I'm going to bed.
Good night.

190
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,505
He kissed her.

191
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,600
I heard that!

192
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,078
Tongue?

193
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:55,875
I hope not.

194
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:56,879
Oh, God!

195
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,916
Hey, how's it going?

196
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,318
Good. How are you?

197
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,912
Can't complain.

198
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,388
I think Paris and Nicole miss you.

199
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,018
They'll live.

200
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,963
Hey, Manny, you heard the news?

201
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,900
Our player here has finally
found himself a steady girl.

202
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,096
Yeah, I heard.

203
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,231
I don't get it, man. You can get
any piece of tail on campus.

204
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,899
Why are you messing
with some egghead dyke?

205
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,874
Man, she's not a dyke!

206
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,502
All right, man. Chill back.
Whatever, man.

207
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,342
Hey!

208
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,510
Now, if you two ladies
are done making out,

209
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,282
get changed
and take it out on the field.

210
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,584
- Sorry.
- Sorry, Coach.

211
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,898
I hope this girl starts
putting out soon, loosen you up.

212
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,997
You're way too tense.

213
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,670
Seriously, man.
I don't mean nothing by it.

214
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,812
Look, bro, if you like her,
that's cool.

215
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,279
You know that, right?

216
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,751
Lo, I'm sorry.

217
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,662
So, when do we get to meet this boy?

218
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,863
Um... never?

219
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,531
Tru, whatever kids these days
are calling it,

220
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,973
this boy is interested in you.

221
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,442
You're not doing stuff together.
We need to meet him.

222
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,571
I told you. He's just a friend.

223
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,842
And we want to meet your friends.

224
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,817
Do you think we'll "embarrath" you?

225
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,223
Of course you'll embarrass me,
but I'm totally used to that.

226
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,814
Well, then, what's the problem?

227
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,483
He's gonna think I'm a dork
if I'm like,

228
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,062
"Yeah, you have to come over
and meet my parents."

229
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,263
Tell you what.

230
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,130
You can roll your eyes
and tell him what squares we are.

231
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,796
That's the time-honored way for kids
to deal with this sort of thing.

232
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,930
Right. So deal with it.

233
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,271
We'll wear our best overalls
and tool belts just to impress him.

234
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,612
That's probably exactly
what he's expecting.

235
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,945
Oh, well, good. Then it'll be
an educational experience for him.

236
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,551
On an historical footnote,

237
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,052
more and more things
are being found out...

238
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,419
found out about...
excuse me... the Montagues,

239
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,754
uh, specifically,
uh, Lady Montague,

240
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,455
who was the wife
and Romeo's mother.

241
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,293
Not too many people know this,
but she was lactose intolerant.

242
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,532
Where you goin', Mama?

243
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,765
I thought I told you, baby.

244
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,442
I got me a date.

245
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,068
So does Lo.

246
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:41,541
Mm-hmm.

247
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,875
Everybody got a date in this house
but me.

248
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,882
Well, how do I look?

249
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,986
Baby, you look so fine.

250
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,146
Don't be telling him that, Cynthia.

251
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,589
He's got a swelled head
enough as it is.

252
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,388
Where you taking the lucky lady?

253
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,995
Out for a night on the town.

254
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,227
Where'd you get the money for that?

255
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,822
I've been saving, Gran.

256
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,697
You better be saving for college,

257
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,101
instead of spending it all
on some white girl.

258
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,070
Now, here you go.

259
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,868
Mama, leave him alone!

260
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,843
I'm just happy you have found a girl
that you feel like this about.

261
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,210
Thank you for letting me use the car.

262
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:17,944
Don't wait up.

263
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,508
Hey, you be back by midnight
if you want to borrow it again!

264
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,886
And don't be running out of gas
on Lover's Lane.

265
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,186
Lover's Lane?

266
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,285
There ain't no Lover's Lane!

267
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,708
Bet you thought
you'd have trouble guessing

268
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,310
which one of us
is the biological mother, huh?

269
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,359
I'll go see if Tru is ready.

270
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,557
Uh, so, uh, I hear you're
on the football team.

271
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,498
What position?

272
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,196
- Quarterback.
-  Oh, wow!

273
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,831
What'd you think of Peyton Manning
in that final quarter?

274
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,876
Are you kidding me?
That guy was on fire!

275
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,978
I know! I couldn't believe
he got off that last throw!

276
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,738
There were, like,
five guys rushing him!

277
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,408
Ahem. Hey.

278
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,041
Oh.

279
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,579
Wow. You look great.

280
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,586
Thanks.

281
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,351
Whew.
Well, I guess we should get going.

282
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,553
Oh, yeah, yeah. Have fun.

283
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,055
And remember,
be home by midnight.

284
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,725
Oh, yes, Ma'am. Ma'ams!

285
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,166
Yeah.

286
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,067
Why didn't Tru tell us?

287
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,113
Well, maybe she doesn't know.
I mean, it's not that obvious.

288
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,207
Hold the phone.
What are you talking about?

289
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,848
What are you talking about?

290
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,249
He's black.

291
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,914
Of course he's black...
and he's gay.

292
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,582
What? Wha...?

293
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,858
I know it's hard to tell with guys,
but didn't your gaydar go off?

294
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,365
You know me. Unless they're
wearing a feather boa

295
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,903
or humming a Judy Garland tune,
I don't have a clue.

296
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,132
I'm telling you, that boy
is as queer as a three-dollar bill.

297
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,469
Well, if he's gay,
why is he taking out our daughter?

298
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,205
Okay, fine. Maybe you're right.

299
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,746
But let's stick to the subject.

300
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:30,644
What subject?

301
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,942
The boy is black!

302
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,116
I don't think an interracial romance
was done so badly by you.

303
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:41,254
Besides, if I'm right about this boy,
ain't gonna be much romance.

304
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,221
Sorry about my parents.

305
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,853
Despite being gay, they're actually
kind of old-fashioned.

306
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,693
Nah, it's cool.
They seem nice.

307
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,166
I told them this wasn't
any heavy thing, but they're like,

308
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,965
"He's taking you out. That's dating.
We want to meet him."

309
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,242
So... are we dating?

310
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,241
Do we have to label it?

311
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,505
No! Of course not.

312
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,614
I just want to know what to say

313
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,183
to all the other guys
who are asking me out.

314
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,980
Hello! Paging your sense of humor!

315
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,523
Are we going into the city?
I should have told my moms.

316
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,525
What they don't know
won't hurt 'em.

317
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,562
I know it's kind of goofy,
but I don't lie to them.

318
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,790
It's kind of a deal we have.

319
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,263
That's great.

320
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,300
Wouldn't work with my family.

321
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,733
Why not?

322
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,499
They don't really want to know
how things are.

323
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,106
They wanna hear
what they wanna hear,

324
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,199
so that's what I tell them.

325
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,211
But then they never really know
who you are, do they?

326
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,207
Guess not.

327
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,283
Don't you want them to?
You're a great guy.

328
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,319
Maybe if they knew the real me,
they wouldn't think so.

329
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,785
The real you?

330
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,955
Please don't tell me
you're an axe murderer

331
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,393
now that we're speeding away
from home at 70 miles an hour.

332
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,226
We're only doing 65.

333
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,866
Is that a yes or no
to the whole axe-murderer thing?

334
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,734
Where are we?

335
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,572
"The Marvelous Wonderettes."

336
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,578
It's, like, L.A.'s
longest-running musical.

337
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,342
It got killer reviews.
You're gonna love it.

338
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,441
It sounds great,
but weren't those expensive?

339
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,817
Hey, we're worth it.

340
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,189
Do you guys know each other?

341
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:24,728
What?

342
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,362
That guy.

343
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:27,724
Oh.

344
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,326
No. I was thinking he could,
you know, take our picture

345
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,732
to commemorate the occasion.

346
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,735
Do you mind?

347
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,572
- Uh... Okay.
- Just press it.

348
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,676
Smile!

349
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,177
-  Good.
- Okay.

350
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:43,739
Thanks.

351
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,178
You're welcome.

352
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,755
She should be home by now.

353
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,657
She's not late yet.

354
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,190
What?

355
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,855
I don't like this.

356
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,267
Is it possible that I've lived
with you all these years

357
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,701
and never realized
that you are a racist?

358
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,033
I'm black. I can't be a racist.

359
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,573
That makes no sense.

360
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:11,902
I'm not a racist.

361
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,978
It's just that I grew up
with boys like that.

362
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,912
"Boys like that?"
Do you even hear yourself?

363
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,643
I don't trust him.

364
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,949
I'm telling you,
this boy we can trust with Tru.

365
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:28,220
Where I come from, black boy,
white girl, that spells trouble.

366
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,328
So did a black woman
and a white woman,

367
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,793
but that never stopped us.

368
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,458
Yeah, well,
we were in San Francisco.

369
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,864
So, we're here now, aren't we?

370
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,098
Look, Tru is gonna make
her own choices,

371
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,299
and she'll have to deal
with the consequences.

372
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,399
That is life.

373
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,071
She's just a kid. We still get
to make some of her choices.

374
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,579
In case you hadn't noticed,

375
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:54,379
she's a 40-year-old
caught in a 16-year-old's body.

376
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,717
Sometimes I think she's smarter
than both of us.

377
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,256
Combined.

378
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,656
Ah. Speak of our little devil.

379
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,854
On the dot.

380
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:07,889
She's a good kid.

381
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,864
I know.

382
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,629
So stop worrying.

383
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,395
Okay.

384
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,268
I love you.

385
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,700
Love you, too.

386
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:07,615
Hello?

387
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,750
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

388
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,657
Hey, pumpkin! How you doin'?

389
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,024
Dom, pick up the phone.

390
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,827
Hey, little girl!
How's life in the boonies?

391
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,196
Boring. Tedious. Just fine.

392
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,827
Listen.

393
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,029
<i>I need some advice.</i>

394
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,606
Dom, alert the media.

395
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,903
Our teenage daughter
actually wants our advice.

396
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,477
It's about a boy, right?

397
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,239
What else are we experts on?

398
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,507
He seems to really like me.
He's just amazingly sweet.

399
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,378
He took me to see

400
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,111
<i>"The Marvelous Wonderettes"</i>
<i>last night. Can you believe it?</i>

401
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,050
Gay.

402
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,552
So gay!

403
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,214
- What was that?
- Oh, nothing, sweetie. Go on.

404
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:45,295
Anyway, I know he likes me,
but he hasn't even kissed me yet.

405
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,762
<i>And last night,</i>

406
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:50,026
I thought I felt this weird vibe
between him and this other guy.

407
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,497
Uh, honey, I'm trying to think
how to put this delicately...

408
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,801
He's gay, Tru!

409
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,274
Gay, gayer, gayest!

410
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,684
Hey, babe!
Come on, sit with us.

411
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,585
Okay.

412
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,987
Come on.

413
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,960
Hey, move out the way.

414
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,358
Hey.

415
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,156
Hello.

416
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,629
Whatever you do,
don't eat the mashed potatoes.

417
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,963
They're like library paste.

418
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,832
Thanks for the tip.
I wasn't even tempted.

419
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,133
Hey, guess where I took Tru
over the weekend.

420
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,233
Went to the city.
We had a blast, didn't we, baby?

421
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,333
Wow.

422
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,979
That sounds romantic.

423
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,843
Why don't you ever
do anything romantic?

424
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,407
'Cause you
ain't my girlfriend, woman.

425
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,542
You and me just having fun.

426
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,779
Ah, ha, ha!
He told you!

427
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,048
Not that much fun.

428
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,248
You tell him!

429
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,587
Ah, hell, no. Okay, you see
what's happening here, right?

430
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,750
You're making me look bad.

431
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,656
That's not exactly difficult.

432
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,763
Okay, see, now, you're just...

433
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,898
Okay, wait.

434
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,027
Yeah? What happens?

435
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,294
I'll put it down if you put it down.
I'll put it down if you put it down.

436
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,233
-  Down.
-  Say my name. Say my name!

437
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,999
Do you need a time-out?

438
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:02,801
I think you do.

439
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,667
Wait till practice, Lo.

440
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:16,082
You know, it's cool of your parents
just to let us hang like this.

441
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,712
They trust me.

442
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,720
I thought you said
they were old-fashioned.

443
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,156
I meant for leftist dykes
from San Francisco.

444
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,561
Can I ask you something?

445
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,269
Yeah, sure.

446
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,540
Have you ever
been attracted to a guy?

447
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,008
What?

448
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,277
You know,
'cause it's okay if you have.

449
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,980
I had a crush on this girl
back at my old school.

450
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,386
It never went anywhere, but...

451
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,425
Wait, are you trying to tell me
that you're gay?

452
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:58,051
No! No, no. l...

453
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,157
I'm just saying that it's okay
to have feelings

454
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,358
that people, you know,
who are uptight

455
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,935
might label a certain way.

456
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,868
What are you doing?

457
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:12,137
Well, you're not gay, right?

458
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,645
And, you know, we're kinda
going out, so I figured...

459
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,408
Okay.

460
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,244
Okay, truth time.

461
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,720
Why did you just kiss me?

462
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,520
What do you mean, why?

463
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,319
Why do boys kiss girls?

464
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,758
I'm not asking about boys.

465
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,727
I'm asking about you.

466
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,628
I just felt like it.

467
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,594
To prove something?

468
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,998
Lo, it's okay.
It's going to be all right.

469
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,441
I gotta go.

470
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,513
Lo, don't run away!

471
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,808
Look, I'm not trying
to insult you. l...

472
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,847
You don't know shit!

473
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,045
And you better not
be spreading lies about me.

474
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,849
What the hell is wrong with you?

475
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,117
Look, I'm just trying to get you
to admit what we both know.

476
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,750
You're gay!
Big fucking deal!

477
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,590
I ain't even trying to hear this shit.

I don't wanna talk about it.

486
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:40,255
Did he try something?
Because I will kick his ass!

487
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,727
No ass-kicking is required.
Believe me.

488
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,032
Well, he did something
to upset you.

489
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,628
I told you, I don't wann...

490
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,667
I'll get it.

491
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:04,684

Tru, it's Lodell.

493
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:29,345
Um... I'm so sorry.

494
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,005
It's okay.

495
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,645
I'm your friend.

496
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,980
You don't have to hide from me.

497
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,949
It's just, um...

498
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:45,754
I don't... want to be... gay.

499
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,230
As near as I can tell,
we don't get to choose.

500
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,168
Yeah.

501
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,004
Just kinda sucks, you know?

502
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,635
It's not that big a deal anymore.

503
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:05,842
Maybe not where you come from,
but where I'm from,

504
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,113
there's no such thing
as a black gay football player.

505
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,247
Most black folks I know think
being gay is some sort of white thing.

506
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,121
Well, that's just silly!

507
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:20,095
I mean, what about James Baldwin,
Langston Hughes, Bayard Rustin?

508
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,598
What football team do they play for?

509
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:30,298
Well, you don't have
to tell anyone till you're ready.

510
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,805
You won't tell?

511
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,479
Of course not.

512
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,549
It's your business.

513
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,719
I love you, Tru.

514
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,920
As a friend.

515
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,751
Yeah, I know.

516
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:46,983
Story of my life.

517
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,422
Bye, Mom.
Thanks for the ride.

518
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,625
Have a good day, sweetie.

519
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,527
Hey, guys, how you doin'?

520
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,128
Hey, Tru!
How's my girl?

521
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,832
Oh!

522
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,273
Whoo!

523
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,537
Fine. I'm fine.

524
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,037
Oh, look, she's shy.

525
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,480
Oh, so sweet, mama.
You're so sweet.

526
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,280
You know, you should try out
for the cheerleading squad next year.

527
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,148
You'd be great.

528
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,449
-  I don't know about that.
-  Look, look.

529
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,848
What you looking at, faggot?

530
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,459
- You trying to check out my ass?
- He didn't do anything.

531
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,493
He's looking at me.

532
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,496
So what if he is?
It's a free country.

533
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,657
Be grateful you have an ass
someone wants to look at.

534
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,168
That boy ain't gay,
else he be checking out my ass.

535
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,703
Checking out your ass?
Please.

536
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,329
Your ass can't hold a candle
next to mine.

537
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,772
Yeah, well, I never tried
putting candles up my ass, gay boy!

538
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,869
Yeah, right.
Try a lot of kickin'.

539
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,751
Hi. We were never
properly introduced.

540
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:49,581
I'm Walter.

541
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,587
Hey, I'm Tru.

542
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,954
Do you need a ride?
My car's right around the corner.

543
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,458
Sure.

544
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:03,261
Uh, thanks for saving my life,
by the way.

545
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:08,032
That may be a bit of an exaggeration,
but you're welcome.

546
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:12,475
So, are you gay,
or is just your boyfriend gay?

547
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,340
You shut up.

548
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,909
Who's incredibly hot.

549
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,313
I know. My luck.

550
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,676
So, you knew.

551
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,384
You can't tell anybody.

552
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,483
No problem. It's the least I can do
for my bodyguard.

553
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,757
Will you stop already?
It's no big deal.

554
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,093
It was to me.

555
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,397
I've been pushed around
for as long as I can remember

556
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,027
for being a sissy.

557
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,073
But a guy like Manuel,
he could break every bone in my body

558
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,904
before any one of the lunch ladies
would say "boo."

559
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,740
You can't be the only gay person
on campus.

560
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,407
I mean, maybe we just need
to raise awareness.

561
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,279
"Be Kind to a Queer" Week?

562
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,080
Or a gay-straight alliance.

563
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,586
You're serious?

564
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,657
Why not?
Other schools have them.

565
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,418
Who'd come?

566
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,892
I don't know.
Would you?

567
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,429
Hell, yeah.
Everyone knows I'm gay, anyway.

568
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,396
It's right there on my web page.

569
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,194
Then there'd be two of us.

570
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,828
You're gay. I'm straight.
Let's make an alliance.

571
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:22,235
So, what was that all about
the other day?

572
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,881
What? You mean with the gay guy?

573
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:29,317
No, I know what that was about.
I meant with me, before school.

574
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,116
What? I was happy to see you.

575
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,623
Lo, I said I wouldn't tell anyone.

576
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,320
I didn't say I'd be your Katie Holmes.

577
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,862
Look, everyone thinks we're a couple.

578
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,558
If we don't act like a couple,
they'll think we broke up.

579
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,567
It feels wrong, like lying.

580
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:49,470
Tru, come on, you are my girl,
just not in the way that people think.

581
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,667
It's not my fault
if people make assumptions.

582
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,711
This is it.

583
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,288
Are you sure
it can support our weight?

584
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,687
Yeah, I'm sure.

585
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,124
And we're not gonna get in trouble?

586
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,664
Nah. This house has been abandoned
for almost a year.

587
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,993
It's really cool.

588
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,692
Um, yeah.
It's like my own secret hideaway.

589
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:25,208
I come up here
when I need to think... or sing.

590
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,172
Sing?

591
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,107
Sing.

592
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,646
Well, I mean,
no one can hear me up here.

593
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,318
Last summer, I treated the squirrels
to the entire score of "Evita."

594
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,284
I was better than Madonna.

595
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,117
Does it really make your life easier
if people think we're a couple?

596
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,025
You have no idea.

597
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:50,931
It's like I don't have to waste time
and energy proving how normal I am.

598
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,465
Then, I guess it's worth it.

599
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:02,578
Maybe someday you'll sing for me.

600
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,375
Maybe.

Good practice, guys.

610
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,421
-  Thanks, Coach.
-  Thanks, Coach.

611
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:54,021
Lo, your new girl,
she's waiting for you outside.

612
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,192
And, boy, is she something else!

613
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,260
Yeah, Lodell's gonna
get himself some meow tonight.

614
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,232
Come on, come on.

615
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,898
Settle down.

616
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,907
You're only gonna last a minute.

617
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,069
I didn't for your mama.

618
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,656
I watched you guys practice.
You're really great.

619
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,193
Oh. Thanks.

620
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,262
No, I mean it.

621
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,127
I thought you were
just playing to... pass.

622
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,326
But you really like it, don't you?

623
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,902
I love it.

624
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,564
Okay, I know you're not supposed
to like football and musical theater,

625
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:36,799
but I do.

626
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,432
I guess I'm kind of weird.

627
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,736
You're great.

628
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:41,937
And who knows?

629
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:45,140
Maybe you'll be the first guy to write
a Broadway musical about football.

630
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,420
Come on, Lo!

631
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,285
You can do better than that!

632
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:57,926
Oooh!

633
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,530
That boy don't need no practice!

634
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,633
Ha, ha, ha!
Come on!

635
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,265
So, you see,
Mr. Velasquez,

636
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,898
we really believe
that a Gay/Straight Alliance

637
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:12,998
would be a good opportunity...

638
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,204
You're Gertrude Spivey-Johnson,
the new girl.

639
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,611
Yes, Mr. Velasquez.
But people call me "Tru."

640
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,683
Yes. Well, Gertrude,
I don't disagree,

641
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,479
but there are procedures
that must be followed.

642
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,077
You'll need permission
to use a classroom after hours.

643
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,213
Only registered clubs
can use school facilities.

644
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:26,847
Right.

645
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,358
All flyers and posters will need
to be cleared through my office.

646
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,085
Of course.

647
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:31,923
And you'll need a faculty advisor.

648
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,020
Mrs. Muller!

649
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:40,834
No. Definitely not. Gotta go.
Very busy. Very busy.

650
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,833
If you want to have this meeting
next week, as you say,

651
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,374
I suggest you get right on it.

652
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,966
Good morning.

653
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,356
Come on!

654
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,330
Oh, yeah, bitch!

655
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,105
I wonder what it's like in there.

656
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:20,003
Boring, I'm sure.

657
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,440
Hey, sorry to bother you,
Mr. Bushnell.

658
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,911
Do you have a minute?

659
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,040
What's on your mind?

660
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:26,980
Walter Amherst and I

661
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,450
are in the process of starting
a Gay/Straight Alliance,

662
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,250
and we were told
that we need a faculty sponsor.

663
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,653
I was hoping that maybe...

664
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,453
What...?

665
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,590
What made you come to me?

666
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,530
You're my favorite teacher.

667
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,257
Oh.

668
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,632
Thank you, Tru.

669
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,262
You're an excellent student,

670
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:52,240
and I really enjoy
having you in my class.

671
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,036
I wish I could help you.

672
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,575
I really do.

673
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,448
But I have to think of my reputation.

674
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,126
Tru, you know who you should try?

675
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,958
Uh, Marjorie Lewis,
the drama teacher.

676
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:16,464
She's married with two kids,
and everyone knows she's a liberal.

677
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:20,729
Thanks. I'll talk to her.

678
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,185
So, you see, we really think, um,

679
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,255
that a Gay/Straight Alliance
would be...

680
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,416
Gay/Straight Alliance!

681
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,288
Give me that.

682
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,194
I say we rock this joint!

683
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,715
Can you believe this crap?

684
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,788
Yes, I can believe it.
I'm helping organize it.

685
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,514
lt'd be great
if you guys could come today.

686
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,784
If the cool kids show up, it will be...

687
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,587
Oh, no, no, no. No cool kids
are coming to this thing.

688
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:20,391
- This ain't okay. It's jacked.
- Wait, wait, wait. I might want to go.

689
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,192
Me too.

690
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,292
Whatever.
Y'all just messing with me.

691
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,199
Everything's not about you.

692
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,239
I just don't think it's right.
God didn't make Adam and Steve.

693
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,967
Who made
all the gay people, then?

694
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,405
You think they're being assembled

695
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,068
by underage factory workers
in Malaysia?

696
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,371
I don't know who made 'em.

697
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,037
I ain't no theolo-magician
or whatever.

698
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,376
All I know is that shit ain't right.

699
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:39,641
If God's gonna punish gay people,

700
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,014
then they they certainly don't need
any additional crap from you.

701
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,883
Why can't you just leave 'em alone
and let them live their lives?

702
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,690
God! Shut your mouth!

703
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,589
What? Oh, now
I can't express my opinion?

704
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,390
Excuse me
for speaking my mind.

705
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,260
I better make sure she's okay.

706
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,527
Oh, Lo, let her go, bro.

707
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,236
Are you okay?

708
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,815
Tru, why didn't you tell me
you were gonna do this?

709
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,019
I didn't think you'd want
to be involved.

710
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,381
I don't.

711
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,279
You can't either.

712
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,584
Excuse me?

713
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,886
What are people going to think

714
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,858
if my girlfriend's running
the gay club?

715
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,953
Gay/Straight Alliance or GSA.

716
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,259
Yeah, whatever.
People are gonna talk.

717
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,130
Maybe they'll think
I'm an enlightened person.

718
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,099
They'll think you're a dyke!

719
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:37,340
What you're really worried about
is what they'll think about you.

720
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:46,613
Look, for the first time
in a long time,

721
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,083
I just, I feel kind of safe.

722
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,315
It's like I don't have to watch
every word, every move.

723
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:57,755
I'm happy that our friendship
has nice side benefits for you.

724
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:01,389
But making you feel comfortable
is not my number-one goal in life.

725
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,193
I know. I'm...

726
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,995
Okay, so don't give me crap
about this.

727
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,939
You're never gonna change people
like Manuel, you know.

728
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,641
Look, you're entitled
to choose your own friends,

729
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,480
but I'm not having lunch
with him anymore.

730
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,245
He's obnoxious and crude.

731
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,323
Maybe he doesn't hurt your feelings,
but he hurts mine.

732
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,914
Of course he hurts my feelings.

733
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,992
So say something to him!
Tell him he's being an ignorant shit.

734
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,595
I do! All the time!

735
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,630
Just not about this.

736
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,700
Look, I'm sorry. It's just
I've got a lot to lose here, okay?

737
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:42,433
Yeah, like your self-respect.

738
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,219
Hi!

739
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,716
We are here.

740
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,088
We decided we're converting.

741
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,024
- Yeah, men suck.
- Yeah.

742
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,152
Okay, um, take a seat.

743
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,163
It looks like it's going to be
a small group.

744
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,597
Okay.

745
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,732
Ooh!

746
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:59,082
Okay, then,
I guess we'll get started.

747
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,673
I'm Tru. This is Walter.

748
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,341
Welcome to the first meeting

749
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,785
of the Walt Whitman High School
Gay/Straight Alliance.

750
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,595
Man, I'm surprised
you're not at that meeting.

751
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,426
We have practice.

752
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,897
Otherwise you'd be there?

753
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,904
Look, it's important to Tru.
Tru's important to me.

754
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,303
You got a problem with that?

755
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,774
No, man, I don't. I'm just saying...

756
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,545
Take a knee.

757
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,120
Is that the best we can do, ladies?

758
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,728
Huh? Christ! What is it?

759
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:50,089
You don't want to be here?
Is that the problem?

760
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:54,000
I know!
You have somewhere better to be.

761
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,368
Why don't we just finish early,

762
00:42:56,473 --> 00:43:01,501
and then all of you can just go
to your little gay meeting, huh?

763
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,343
God! What is this world coming to?

764
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:10,386
Kids can't even say prayers in class.

765
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,921
But the fags, they get their own club!

766
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,249
Never would have happened
in my day. Never!

767
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,995
So, what's it gonna be, ladies?

768
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,066
Are we gonna put a little muscle
into these plays,

769
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,930
or we just gonna
call it quits for the day,

770
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:30,063
you can go meet your boyfriends
at the Fag Scouts of America, huh?

771
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,641
We want to play ball, Coach!

772
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,833
Who are we?

773
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,034
Chargers!

774
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,178
What do we do?

775
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,278
Play ball!

776
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,505
Then let's play ball!

777
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,077
I mean, the problem is

778
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,710
people just don't think of it
as a civil-rights issue.

779
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,117
Exactly. I think it's
absolutely absurd when people say

780
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,155
that gay marriage
is any less a civil-rights issue

781
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,589
than segregation was for blacks.

782
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,684
Right.
I mean, separate isn't equal.

783
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,128
If only today's courts had the guts
to legalize gay marriage.

784
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,789
We have something to say.

785
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,232
We're cool with it
as long as it's not our boyfriends.

786
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,963
Yeah.

787
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,835
Listen, it's great that everyone
has so much to say,

788
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,705
but we were actually supposed
to be out of here half an hour ago.

789
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,472
But we're gonna meet again
at the same time and place next week,

790
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,105
so, yeah, bring your friends.

791
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:13,977
That was great.

792
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,345
I'm totally psyched.

793
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,283
Me, too.
I think it went really well.

794
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:18,855
-  Yeah, it did.
- Excuse me.

795
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,013
Sorry.

796
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:23,093
I just wanted to say how much
I admire you both for doing this.

797
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:26,253
I mean, it's brave,
and it's really kind of wonderful.

798
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,193
Thanks.

799
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,094
Yeah, thank you.

800
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,461
- It was Trevor, right?
- Yeah.

801
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,432
Congratulations, kids!

802
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,662
What you're doing here is terrific.

803
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,773
I'm announcing it to all my classes.

804
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:38,636
Not to promote stereotypes,

805
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,939
but they don't call themselves
"drama queens" for nothing.

806
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:45,209
So, what are you guys up to now?
You wanna do something or...?

807
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,942
Oh, Walter's not going anywhere.

808
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,607
We've got rehearsal.

809
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:49,777
He's a Jet, you know.

810
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,443
And when you're a Jet,
you're a Jet all the way.

811
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,682
From your first cigarette
to your last dying day.

812
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:55,850
Say "Maria."

813
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,051
"Maria?"

814
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,892
No! Say it loud,
like it's music playing.

815
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:02,727
Maria!

816
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,198
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

817
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,566
I guess we're just gonna have
to keep looking for our Tony.

818
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,468
Come along, Walter.

819
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:10,562
- Bye.
- Bye.

820
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,112
So, where are we going?

821
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,576
Well, we are gonna go see the sights.

822
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,648
There are sights?

823
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,116
Oh, yeah.

824
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,187
Coming up on our left is the best
<i>taquería</i> north of Tijuana.

825
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,483
- Really?
-  Mm-hmm.

826
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:29,922
Well, I admit I have yet to achieve
my lifelong ambition

827
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,790
of eating at every one,
but I'm pretty close.

828
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,363
And this place is still the best.

829
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,693
Do you like Mexican food?

830
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,595
Who doesn't?

831
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,170
Wait! Even more important question.
Do you like used bookstores?

832
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,932
You mean dusty, narrow little shops
full of out-of-print books?

833
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,700
Usually with two guys
in the back...

834
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,105
With thick glasses and dandruff.

835
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,474
Arguing about whether or not
Kerouac is overrated.

836
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,341
Oh, my G... If there's a heaven,
I think that's what it smells like.

837
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:55,644
Okay. You're really weird.

838
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,947
I like that in a person.

839
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,646
Well, in case you are
into that sort of thing,

840
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,850
the only decent used book store
in the whole Valley

841
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,859
is actually right back there
on your left.

842
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,357
I don't have you in any of my classes.
Are you a senior?

843
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:12,265
Yep. I'll be going to UCLA
in the fall, actually.

844
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:15,701
Wow. Impressive.
What will you be studying?

845
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,969
I'm torn between undecided
and undeclared.

846
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:21,944
That's about it for the main drag,

847
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:25,640
but I do know the perfect spot
to watch the sun go down.

848
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:32,982
Wow. You were right.

849
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,786
This place is almost beautiful
from way up here.

850
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,027
We should get going.

851
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,101
My moms, they kind of...

852
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:51,004
Okay, I'm not that big of a fag hag.

853
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,508
What are you talking about?

854
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,771
I'm not gay.

855
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,176
Of course you are!

856
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,408
I think I'd know.

857
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,146
What were you doing at the meeting?

858
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,243
What were you doing at the meeting?

859
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,520
Oh, my God.
Do I really seem that gay?

860
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,423
You're good-looking
and well-groomed,

861
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:12,790
and you dress like a hipster.

862
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,091
I guess I just made assumptions.

863
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,691
And those are all bad qualities
in someone asking you out?

864
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,929
They're not.
Of course they're not.

865
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,131
Wait.

866
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,701
You're asking me out?

867
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,709
Do you already have a boyfriend
or something?

868
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:37,183
There's no easy way to explain this.

869
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:42,358
I guess you could say
that I have a friend who's a guy,

870
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,352
but it wouldn't be a problem
for me to start seeing you,

871
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:50,023
just as long as nobody
at school found out.

872
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,903
I'm sorry. What?

873
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,301
That sounded really bad, huh?

874
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,565
You know what?
Never mind.

875
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:57,367
I'm not the kind of guy

876
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,169
who's gonna sneak around
with someone else's girl.

877
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:00,436
No, no, it's not like that.

878
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,174
Everybody at school
thinks I'm dating this guy.

879
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:09,878
He's on the football team,
but really we're just good friends.

880
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,717
So, that's the big secret?

881
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,723
That you're not humping
this football player?

882
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,917
Yeah.

883
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,052
You see,
it's kind of important to him

884
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:22,620
for people to think
that we're, like, a couple.

885
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,890
Oh.

886
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,264
Oh.

887
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,804
Oh!

888
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,135
I think I'm starting
to get the picture now.

889
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,636
You're his Katie.

890
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,438
Yeah.

891
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:42,007
So, in reality, I'm totally available,
but I wouldn't wanna hurt him.

892
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,144
I get it, Tru.

893
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,985
It's all so twisted, huh?

894
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:51,117
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty twisted.

895
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:56,622
I really don't give a damn who knows
or doesn't know who I'm dating.

896
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:12,174
I'm so sorry!
I should have called.

897
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,512
Yes, you should have!
And why was your cell phone off?

898
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,243
Who was that boy?

899
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:16,614
Why are we paying
for your cell phone

900
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,051
if you don't even answer
when we call you?

901
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:18,644
I'm sorry!

902
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,882
Sorry is not good enough.
We were worried sick.

903
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,424
- Leslie and l...
- Will you stop, please?

904
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:26,189
This is the most exciting night
of my life, and you're ruining it.

905
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,627
What's going on?

906
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,359
I met a boy.

907
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,799
I thought he was gay, but he isn't.
He's a gay-acting straight boy.

908
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,872
Isn't that cool?
We're going out again this weekend.

909
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,908
No, you are not.
You are grounded this weekend.

910
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:43,569
No, mom, you can't. Please.
You were young once.

911
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,547
Don't you remember the excitement
you felt the first time you met Lisa?

912
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,548
Boy, she's good.

913
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,414
Please? Can we do
another punishment?

914
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,956
I'll do the dishes for a week.
I'll take out the trash.

915
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,888
Those are already your chores.

916
00:49:56,026 --> 00:50:00,019
But I'll really do them...
and without complaining. Please?

917
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:04,897
Okay. But we get to meet this boy.

918
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:08,232
And you have to be home by 10:00.

919
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,907
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

920
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,705
-  Homework.
- Okay. Okay.

921
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:19,546
"You were young once"?

922
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,173
She was talking to you.

923
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,752
Dad, I'm home.

924
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,756
Where you been?

925
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:34,561
Um, I've actually been on a date.

926
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:39,692
Kind of a date. I mean,
I met this really amazing girl today.

927
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:42,270
I'll make hot chocolate.
We'll talk all about it.

928
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,772
Dad, please don't go
all Golden Girls on me.

929
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,742
Can't you just punch me in the arm
and say, "Way to go"?

930
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,402
Way to go, stud.

931
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,479
Now, sit your ass down.
I'm making hot chocolate!

932
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:52,843
Okay.

933
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,316
Do you want to do something
Saturday night?

934
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,513
You know, like a movie
or something?

935
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:01,784
Can't. I already have plans.

936
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,382
Plans?

937
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,427
Oh, what, with your moms?

938
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:07,991
No.

939
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,723
With Trevor.

940
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,027
Who?

941
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,304
Trevor. He came
to the Gay/Straight Alliance.

942
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:16,667
Oh.

943
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,366
Is he really faggy
like that guy Walter?

944
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,145
Does the phrase
"internalized homophobia"

945
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,178
mean anything to you?

946
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,113
I'm not trying to say
there's anything wrong with that.

947
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,947
I'm just trying to figure out
if I know this guy.

948
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,585
That's him.

949
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:39,151
Blond hair, tall and lean,
with the other Honors geeks.

950
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,698
Yeah, well, he fits in pretty well
with the geeks.

951
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,598
You sound jealous!

952
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:48,033
That's ridiculous. Why would I be
jealous of some other gay guy?

953
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,938
Well, you shouldn't be.
You're still my best pal.

954
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,334
But he's not gay.

955
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,921
Slow down, Trevor.

956
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,550
I'm thrilled you're heterosexual,

957
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,960
but you don't need to prove it
on our first date.

958
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,895
Second date.

959
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:28,294
Look, I want to take things slow.

960
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,202
And if that's not okay...

961
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:34,903
It's okay. It's totally okay.

962
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:39,309
I'm sorry.
I just got a little over-excited.

963
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,781
You're beautiful.

964
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,914
You're so full of shit.
You're just horny.

965
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,749
Maybe.

966
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,986
But you are beautiful.

967
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,891
Even more so
if you don't even really know it.

968
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,496
You mean it?

969
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,659
Yeah, of course I mean it.

970
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,795
Now, can I please just feel you up?

971
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,097
Come here.

972
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,846
You must be thrilled.
Trevor couldn't be any whiter.

973
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,979
Will you stop?

974
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:24,459
Lodell is a very nice young man,
and so is Trevor, don't you think?

975
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:29,521
Yeah, but doesn't he also seem
a bit gay to you?

976
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,431
I mean, what if Tru
only attracts gay men?

977
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,628
He's straight.
Don't worry.

978
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,671
What makes you so sure?

979
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:39,832
They've been parked in his car
making out for the past half hour.

980
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,002
What? Why didn't you tell me?

981
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,146
Because I knew you'd wanna
go out there and stop them.

982
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,941
Yeah! Didn't you?

983
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:49,643
Yes, but I don't think
that's best for Tru.

984
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,720
She needs to learn
how to make her own choices.

985
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,254
You know what?
She's just a kid.

986
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:55,586
And boys like that, they know
how to put pressure on a girl.

987
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,683
"Boys like that"?

988
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,254
You set me up for that.

989
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,457
I'm just pointing out
that I'm not the only one

990
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,433
carrying around childhood baggage.

991
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:11,803
Fine, but if she ends up pregnant,
I'm holding you responsible.

992
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,203
So, I thought it'd be a good idea

993
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,369
if we went around the room
and introduced ourselves.

994
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,673
If you don't feel comfortable
giving your name, that's fine.

995
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,578
Just pass or make one up.

996
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,777
So, who wants to go first?

997
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:32,851
Hi. My name is Roberto,
and I'm an alcoholic.

998
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,626
What? Wrong meeting?

999
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:38,894
Actually, I'm just a fag.

1000
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,407
-  What's that song?
-  What?

1001
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,409
Nothing. Just something
I got stuck in my head.

1002
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,911
So, how many were there last week?

1003
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:51,844
Where?

1004
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,643
The fag group.

1005
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,718
Tiffany and Rhonda went.
Ask them.

1006
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:58,486
Coach is right.

1007
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,619
It's a sign of the moral decay
in America.

1008
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:03,989
Man, you are talking
completely out of your ass.

1009
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,358
You wouldn't know moral decay
from tooth decay.

1010
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,293
I know one thing...

1011
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,832
fags are taking over this school.

1012
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,629
It's not right.

1013
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,699
Okay, everybody,
we ought to wrap it up.

1014
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,704
Um, anyone who wants to help out
with Queer Awareness Week,

1015
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:18,796
Trevor has the sign-up sheet.

1016
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:22,400
And if anyone wants
PFLAG scholarship info, I've got it.

1017
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,810
And I got brochures
from L.A.'s Gay and Lesbian Center.

1018
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:28,111
I know it's kind of far, but they have
really great youth services.

1019
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,412
I hope you guys don't mind,

1020
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,079
but I thought a little publicity
might be just the ticket.

1021
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,123
I invited Adrienne.
She writes for the school paper.

1022
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,351
This was amazing.

1023
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,586
Was last week's meeting
this well-attended?

1024
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,560
No. It's definitely grown.

1025
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,927
Cool. Do you guys mind
if I get a picture?

1026
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,966
- Yeah.
-  Yeah.

1027
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,333
Cheese.

1028
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,139
You never say
that you're straight.

1029
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,908
She didn't ask.
That wasn't the point.

1030
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,007
Yeah, but everyone's gonna think
that you're gay.

1031
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,678
And the next logical step is
for them to think that I'm gay.

1032
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:07,256
Lo, you are gay,
in case you've forgotten.

1033
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:10,053
Yeah, and in case you've forgotten,
I'm not exactly ready to come out yet.

1034
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,323
- I thought you respected that.
- I did. I do.

1035
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,159
But you need
to respect my needs, too.

1036
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,462
Oh, you have a need
for people to think you're a dyke?

1037
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,032
God, we fight
like we are in a relationship.

1038
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,868
Why do I get all the grief
and none of the goodies?

1039
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:27,306
Well, I thought you were getting
the goodies from Trevor.

1040
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:29,875
What's that supposed to mean?

1041
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:32,840
Are you sleeping with him?

1042
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:34,973
What?

1043
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:38,213
No! That's not any of your business!

1044
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,457
You know, I think you're just jealous

1045
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,960
because only one of us
has a real boyfriend.

1046
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,654

Ohh!
Trouble in paradise. Watch out.

1053
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,232
What happened?
You two lovebirds get into a fight?

1054
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,133
Nah, nah, we're cool.

1055
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:32,606
Lo, I can't do this anymore.
I just...

1056
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,511
Lo and I are not
boyfriend and girlfriend, okay?

1057
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:40,446
We're just good friends.

1058
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,918
So, why'd you lie to us?

1059
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,884
It was my idea.

1060
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,691
Okay. Why?

1061
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,526
I wanted to help out Tru.

1062
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,757
She didn't want people thinking
that she was a lesbian.

1063
00:58:58,968 --> 00:58:59,935
Oh, shit!

1064
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,094
Are you serious? Guys!

1065
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:04,866
Look, seriously,
as far as I'm concerned,

1066
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:05,963
it's totally fine.

1067
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:09,408
Mm-hmm.
I love Rosie and Ellen.

1068
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,614
What?

1069
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,547
Man, I didn't even like her
when I thought she was straight.

1070
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:17,545
The feeling's mutual.

1071
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,815
I didn't like you even
when I thought you were straight.

1072
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,947
What are you talking about?
Ain't nobody straighter than me!

1073
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,820
Studies show guys
who are homophobic

1074
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:26,487
are the ones with the most latent
homosexual feelings.

1075
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:28,153
Take that back.

1076
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:30,594
Take what back?

1077
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:34,066
- I'm just telling you scientific data.
- No. You're calling me a faggot.

1078
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,933
Your actions
are saying things about you.

1079
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,972
- Don't turn your back on me, dyke!
- Or what?

1080
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:38,971
You'll hit me?

1081
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,135
Yeah, because hitting me
is gonna make you a real man, right?

1082
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,307
Yeah, let me show you
how much of a man I am!

1083
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,006
Let me go! Let me go!

1084
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:47,912
Are you crazy?

1085
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:50,247
You even lay a finger on her,
and you're off the team...

1086
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,945
...permanently!

1087
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,750
And you know that!

1088
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,691
- This ain't over, bitch!
- Walk!

1089
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:02,863
Whoa!

1090
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,030
Hey, Big Stuff.

1091
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:09,434
What's the matter? You can't say
hello to your Gran anymore?

1092
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,632
I know we raised you
better than that.

1093
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:12,867
Sorry, Gran.

1094
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,009
Hello.

1095
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,510
What's wrong?

1096
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,409
Well, you look like your dog died.

1097
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:20,880
We don't have a dog.

1098
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,145
Don't you sass me, boy!

1099
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,287
If you must know,
Tru and I broke up.

1100
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:29,049
That white girl?

1101
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,052
Yeah, the white girl.

1102
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,288
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

1103
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,092
I know you cared for her.

1104
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:36,995
Yeah.

1105
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,694
What happened?
You cheat on her?

1106
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,599
What?

1107
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:45,037
You did not just ask me that!

1108
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:49,578
I love you, baby boy,
but you're a man.

1109
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,877
And there's one thing Gran knows
is about men.

1110
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,042
You don't know about me.

1111
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,750
I know about men, and you a man,

1112
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:02,552
and it makes no difference
'cause that's the way you do it.

1113
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,752
So, what's everybody
in the mood for?

1114
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,954
Cosmos? Appletinis?

1115
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,190
Can't you make anything gayer?

1116
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,267
Don't fuss.
Whatever's easier.

1117
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,165
Look, sweetie.

1118
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,237
Look at you, pumpkin!

1119
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,274
What are you guys doing here?

1120
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:21,941
It's only been a couple of months,

1121
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,206
and you look
like you've grown about a foot.

1122
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,642
Is everything okay?

1123
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:28,308
Everything's fine.
We wanted to surprise you.

1124
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:31,683
Plus, we have
some special news to share.

1125
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:33,153
In person.

1126
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:37,022
You got married?
Congratulations!

1127
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,422
Thank you.

1128
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,292
Emmett totally surprised me
last weekend.

1129
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:44,127
It was very romantic.
Took me to Canada.

1130
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:46,758
I just wish it meant something
in this country.

1131
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,201
Doesn't matter. It's great.

1132
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:51,296
I'm really happy for you two.

1133
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,573
This is your happy face?

1134
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:56,110
I'm sorry. It's been a rough day.

1135
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,837
More boy trouble?

1136
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:01,280
Your gay boyfriend
or the straight one?

1137
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,408
The gay one.

1138
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,782
Invite him over.
Maybe we can straighten him out.

1139
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,479
So to speak.

1140
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,522
Oh, my gosh.

1141
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:37,385
Hey. Um, I didn't expect you to call.

1142
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:41,947
I'm still mad at you,
but I want you to come over tonight.

1143
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,650
My dads came into town
unexpectedly.

1145
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,291
Are you still there?

1146
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,790
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

1147
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,424
So, can you come over?

1148
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:59,369
Um, the thing is,
I've got a lot of homework, so...

1149
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:03,206
Well, we can work on it together.

1150
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:06,179
Or you can just come over
for a few minutes.

1151
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,306
It's just...

1152
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,781
<i>I think it'd be a really good thing</i>

1153
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,445
<i>if you could meet some gay men</i>
<i>who are happy and well-adjusted.</i>

1154
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:14,022
Yeah, tonight's not really good.

1155
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:17,615

eating lunch together
out in the open at school.

1161
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:48,250
Transgressive?
When did you swallow a thesaurus?

1162
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,052
Sorry, my dad's a novelist.

1163
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,751
Well, actually, he's my uncle, but...

1164
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:56,222
He's your father and your uncle?
How <i>Chinatown.</i>

1165
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,028
It's nothing gross, really.

1166
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:03,663
He's my uncle, but he raised me,
so I call him Dad.

1167
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,469
I don't really remember
my biological father.

1168
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,066
What about your mom?

1169
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,738
She's around.

1170
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:17,215
I see her Sundays, holidays.
No sharp objects. That whole thing.

1171
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,218
Wow.

1172
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:19,982
Yeah.

1173
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:22,148
And I thought my family
was complicated.

1174
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,283
You haven't heard the half of it.

1175
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:28,925
Tell me. I'd like to know.

1176
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:30,793
Yeah?

1177
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,095
Okay.

1178
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,533
<i>Reader's Digest</i> version.

1179
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,803
When I was about 4,
I went to live with my Uncle Daniel,

1180
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,377
and soon after, Papa Chad,

1181
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:46,915
which is what I called him,
moved in.

1182
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,950
Wait. Your dad/uncle is gay?

1183
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,579
Sorry. I thought I mentioned that.

1184
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:57,250
Anyway, he's a really, really
good guy.

1185
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,453
You should come over
and meet him sometime.

1186
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,029
Okay.

1187
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,898
Don't look now,
but isn't that your other boyfriend?

1188
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:23,451
Okay. Okay, that's good.
That's the curb.

1189
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,315
All right.
All right, we're here.

1190
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:29,949
Turn that off and then...
You gotta jiggle... turn it... I got it.

1191
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,524
Well, here we are.
Home sweet homo.

1192
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,394
Dad, I'm home!

1193
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,867
Jesus! You could have warned me.

1194
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:45,964
Sorry. This is Tru.
You said, "Bring her over any time."

1195
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:49,044
I meant any time
with a little warning,

1196
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,170
so I could be wearing clothes.

1197
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:54,181
Tru, sorry.
It's very nice to meet you.

1198
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:55,511
Nice to meet you, too.

1199
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:56,913
Please forgive the way I look.

1200
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,247
I work from home,

1201
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:01,152
so I don't usually have to get dressed
until late in the day.

1202
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,723
Or the next day.

1203
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:07,423
You look really familiar, sir.
Are you famous or something?

1204
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:08,758
Call me Daniel.

1205
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:11,924
I'm far too young and pretty
to be a "sir."

1206
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:13,228
Oh, God!

1207
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,527
And I'm semi-well-known

1208
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:21,008
by a very small, very insular group
of gay literati.

1209
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,202
Wait a minute.
You're Daniel Goldstein.

1210
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,904
You're, like, my dad's
favorite author.

1211
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,345
Are you kidding?
You've heard of him?

1212
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,746
Yeah. I read <i>Confessions</i>
<i>of a Short, Fat, Jewish Kid.</i>

1213
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:29,647
I loved it.

1214
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:32,585
Trevor, you must
marry this girl immediately.

1215
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,213
She's obviously a young woman
of taste and distinction.

1216
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:35,983
Oh, boy.

1217
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,389
Are you working on a new book?

1218
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,757
Tru, I think we should go
start on our homework now.

1219
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,329
I'll catch up with you later.

1220
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,692
Okay.

1221
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,844
All done with your homework?

1222
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:06,246
No. I... I can't seem to concentrate.

1223
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:08,856
It's 'cause I'm so sexy, isn't it?

1224
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:12,588
You are sexy, but...

1225
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:15,196
Look, why don't you just call Lo, huh?

1226
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,559
You mean now?

1227
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,190
Why not?

1228
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,700
You're not getting much work done.

1229
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,862
And quite frankly,
you're not such great company.

1230
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,166
I'm sorry.

1231
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,673
I know this is unfair to you.

1232
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,266
I'll survive.

1233
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,740
Just work it out, okay?

1234
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,105
lt'll be all right. I promise.

1235
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:48,062
<i>What up?</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

1236
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:55,831
Hi. You must be Lo's Mom. I'm...

1237
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:58,531
Gertrude.
How do you do?

1238
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,336
So happy to finally meet you.

1239
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:04,001
I keep asking Lo to bring you around,
but you know how he is.

1240
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,546
Yeah, I do.

1241
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:07,115
It's nice to meet you, too.

1242
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:08,774
Um, is Lo home?

1243
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:10,384
I really need to talk to him.

1244
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:12,579
He's not here.
He's hardly ever here.

1245
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,248
Mama said he was here
this afternoon and went out.

1246
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:17,188
Didn't say where he was going.

1247
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:18,988
Okay. Thanks.

1248
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,629
He didn't get you in trouble, did he?

1249
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:25,529
What? No! God, no!

1250
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,595
I'm sorry. It's just that...

1251
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,035
We used to talk, and, um,

1252
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:36,737
now I'm just trying to keep up
with what's going on in his life

1253
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:38,711
but he shuts me out.

1254
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,940
He was such a good boy.

1255
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,609
He's still a good boy.

1256
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:49,957
I know, but something's on his mind.

1257
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,728
If you see him,
can you have him call me?

Tru, don't come up here!

1267
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,983
Lo, you're being childish.
We're still friends. We need to talk.

1268
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:53,019
Tru, go away!

1269
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:57,116
I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

1270
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,561
Tru, wait!

1271
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:08,668
Oww! Oh, my foot!

1272
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,033
Lo, are you okay?

1273
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:11,333
Ooh, that hurts!

1274
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,375
God, I'm... I'm sorry.
Tell Walter I'm sorry, too.

1275
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:15,669
I didn't mean to interrupt you guys.

1276
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:16,301
I know.

1277
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,438
But, Christ, what do you two
think you were doing?

1278
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:20,571
I mean, I know what you were doing.

1279
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:22,412
But just this afternoon
you were parading around school

1280
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,518
with your arm around Tiffany.

1281
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,143
The two don't have anything
to do with each other.

1282
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:26,982
Does she know
you're screwing boys?

1283
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,919
She gets to be the girlfriend
of the star quarterback.

1284
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:30,048
I get what I want.
It's win-win.

1285
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,093
Except she doesn't know anything
about what you want.

1286
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,889
She's probably
half in love with you already.

1287
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:35,725
And what about Walter?
Is this fair to him?

1288
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,128
That's between me and him.

1289
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,461
You called him faggy.

1290
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,499
- You made fun of him.
- Shh.

1291
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:41,832
So, he's good enough to fuck,
but not good enough to hang out with?

1292
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:43,268
Look, you don't understand.

1293
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,100
Where I'm from,
this is just kinda how things work.

1294
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:47,141
You have your regular life,
and you have your other life.

1295
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,209
- You have to keep the two separate.
- And that's what you want?

1296
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,872
This ain't San Francisco.

1297
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:54,176
And I ain't some privileged white boy
who can fly a rainbow flag

1298
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:55,250
and march in some parade.

1299
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:56,113
I got plans.

1300
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,810
Okay, so, all of a sudden
you're a homeboy?

1301
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,785
All about, about keepin' it real,
livin' in the 'hood?

1302
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,355
We all live in the same world, Lo.

1303
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,752
Yeah, that's real easy for you to say.

1304
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,485
You've got your two moms
and your two dads,

1305
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,151
and they all love you
no matter what, right?

1306
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,026
I met your mom. She loves you.
God, does she love you!

1307
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,359
Wait, you met my mom?

1308
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:11,761
What did you say to her?

1309
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:15,359
God, is that all you can think about?
That I'm going to blow your cover?

1310
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,335
You know, it'd probably be
the best thing I could do for you.

1311
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,838
You wouldn't do that.

1312
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:19,930
Why not?

1313
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,701
Because you're my friend.

1314
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,472
Yeah.

1315
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,515
Not much of a friend
you've been to me lately.

1316
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,278
Tru, come on.
Please don't be mad at me.

1317
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:34,544
I'm not mad.
I'm just disappointed.

1318
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:38,286
And don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell on you.

1319
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,593
Is what she said true?

1320
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,631
Wait, Walter.

1321
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,234
- You think I'm a silly faggot?
- No.

1322
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:47,859
Good for getting your rocks off.
That's all.

1323
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:50,335
No! It's not like that.

1324
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:52,906
I think you're a great guy.

1325
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:57,375
You're smart, you're funny.

1326
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,912
You're completely comfortable
in your own skin. I just...

1327
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,650
But you don't want to be seen
in public with me.

1328
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,255
That's about me, not you.

1329
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,085
Yeah, well...

1330
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,820
...sneaking around
just kind of feels...

1331
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,292
...icky.

1332
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,362
I think I should go.

1333
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,884
See ya.

1334
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,210
Okay, I'm sorry.
You wanna make sure it stays.

1335
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:08,340
Here.

1336
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:09,745
Whoa!

1337
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,117
At least in my day,

1338
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:21,889
the queers had the good sense
to be ashamed.

1339
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,532
Practice is over!

1340
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,597
I feel sick to my stomach.

1341
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,937
Man, we gotta do something
about this.

1342
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:40,344
What are you talking about?

1343
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,041
Let 'em know this ain't right.

1344
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:44,585
Man, there's nothing we can do.

1345
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,484
Just forget about it.

1346
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:52,755
I get carsick with my eyes closed.

1347
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:55,523
Come on. It's just for a minute,
all right?

1348
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,622
Walter and I did something.
I think you're gonna love it,

1349
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:58,995
and I want you to get the full effect.

1350
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,726
I'm excited.

1351
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:04,897
Close your eyes, close your eyes!

1352
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,343
Who is that?

1353
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:14,009
Nobody was supposed to be here.
This wasn't part of the plan.

1354
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:27,720
Walter!

1355
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,233
Are you okay?

1356
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,438
That was the football team.

1357
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,377
Couldn't see any of their faces,
though. Could you guys?

1358
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,574
One of the cars was Manuel's.

1359
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:48,741
Okay, we've got them!

1360
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,680
If we report it, they'll cancel
the game on Friday,

1361
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,219
maybe suspend the whole team.

1362
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,720
Then the whole school's
gonna hate us.

1363
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:55,915
So, what are we supposed to do?
Pretend it didn't happen?

1364
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,355
Look, we're screwed if we report this.

1365
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:59,893
They'd probably cancel all the plans
that we've made, okay?

1366
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,222
Figure it's too risky.

1367
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,163
This is ridiculous!
So, there's nothing that we can do?

1368
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,169
Today is my birthday.

1369
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,398
So, who else have we got?

1370
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,238
Oh, Tru! Tru, honey,
come into the dining room.

1371
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,311
I'm busy!

1372
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:19,312
Gertrude, your dads are here.
Come say hi.

1373
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,747
Hi. Now, can I please
go to my room?

1374
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:24,749
See, she's not all sugar and spice.

1375
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,751
- What's wrong, honey?
-  What's wrong, sweetheart?

1376
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:29,323
Please, can we just drop it?
I have homework to do.

1377
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:32,860
Oh, good idea, because then
you'll be free for next Sunday.

1378
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,963
Why? What's next Sunday?

1379
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:38,362
Just our wedding.
You're maid of honor.

1380
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,626
What? You're... You're kidding!

1381
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:44,067
Technically, it's just
a commitment ceremony.

1382
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,902
The boys here inspired us.

1383
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:49,737
Yeah, I thought it was about time
I make an honest woman out of her.

1384
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:51,812
Congratulations!

1385
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:52,881
Thank you!

1386
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,949
We've got a lot of planning to do,
so we're gonna need your help.

1387
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,745
Of course.
Anything, anything!

1388
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,453
Can you come in for a minute?

1389
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,620
Sure, bro.

1390
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,012
Manny, if we were ever friends,

1391
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:27,104
you have got to promise me
that you're not gonna try to talk me

1392
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:28,614
into some bullshit stunt
like that again.

1393
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,344
Man, what are you talking about,
"If we were ever friends"?

1394
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:31,942
We're still friends now, man.
You're my best friend.

1395
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:34,545
Then just leave
Tru and her group alone, man.

1396
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,487
You don't have to like them.
Just leave 'em be.

1397
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:39,524
Bet you it's her.

1398
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:40,993
- It's Tru.
- Yeah.

1399
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,962
-  <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

1400
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,158
<i>I swear, I didn't know</i>
<i>anybody was gonna be there.</i>

1401
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,427
Is... Is Walter okay?

1402
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:49,662
He's furious, but he's okay.

1403
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:50,863
Thank God.

1404
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:52,702
We're all furious, Lo.

1405
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:55,402
I didn't think
I'd ever speak to you again.

1406
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,673
But at least you've made it right.

1407
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,372
Wait, what do you mean?

1408
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:03,017
The blast e-mail you sent out.
That was so brave.

1409
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,216
What are you talking about?
I haven't even logged on today.

1410
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,024
No fucking way.

1411
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:16,687
I didn't send this!

1412
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,026
<i>Somebody</i>
<i>hacked into my account!</i>

1413
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,327
Oh, my God!

1414
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,061
<i>l... Hey, I gotta go.</i>

1415
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:24,638
Lo, don't tell me this is why
we haven't been hanging out, man.

1416
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,572
This is a joke.
I didn't send this.

1417
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:29,701
Seriously, dude?

1418
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,539
Seriously!

1419
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,012
Look, somebody's trying
to get back at me

1420
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,139
for what happened tonight.

1421
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:37,116
- You must be pissed!
- Of course I'm pissed!

1422
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,381
But I can't blame them.

1423
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,418
What we did was fucked up.

1424
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:43,889
Come on, man.
We were messin' around.

1425
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:45,856
It was wrong, Manny.

1426
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,622
They're just trying
to teach a little tolerance.

1427
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:49,697
What were we trying to do?

1428
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,264
Listen, you'd better go.

1429
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:54,768
I've got to send out
a real e-mail right now.

1430
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,303
Yeah.

1431
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:00,732
So, you're not...

1432
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,400
I'll see you tomorrow, Manny.

1433
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:23,398
<i>Hey, hun.</i>

1434
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:24,863
Did you hack Lo's e-mail?

1435
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,968
Well, I couldn't have done it
without Walter.

1436
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,764
But wasn't that fantastic?

1437
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:29,996
<i>Revenge is so sweet.</i>

1438
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,970
Jerk! You're stooping to their level.

1439
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:34,234
Oh, wait, you're mad at me?

1440
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:35,876
We could have reported this
to someone...

1441
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,775
Principal Velasquez,
the ACLU, somebody.

1442
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:41,074
What about your other boyfriend,
the one who tore down our banner?

1443
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:43,615
Of course I'm mad at him,
but I know he's got issues.

1444
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:45,810
What, and I'm not allowed
to have feelings?

1445
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,082
Babe, Walter and I worked
on that thing for two weeks.

1446
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,181
<i>We wanted to surprise you.</i>

1447
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,157
This wasn't your secret to tell.

1448
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,889
You know what? It is always
the people in the closet

1449
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:56,327
<i>who are doing the most damage.</i>

1450
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:59,467
<i>If it's not some evangelical preacher</i>
<i>screwing a rent boy on the side,</i>

1451
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,559
<i>it's some Catholic priest</i>
<i>fondling his parishioners.</i>

1452
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:02,432
<i>I'm so sick of it.</i>

1453
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:03,435
Yeah, so am I,

1454
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:05,904
but if you would've just given me
a chance to talk to him,

1455
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,236
<i>maybe he could have found</i>
<i>the courage to do this himself.</i>

1456
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:11,676
Okay, yeah. I wouldn't put
my money on that one.

1457
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:14,079
I just...

1458
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,061
Can I sit here?

1459
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:53,310
Look, I'm sorry if I hurt you.

1460
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,288
We should have
checked with you first,

1461
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:57,654
but I'm not sorry that we did it.

1462
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,131
My moms are getting married Sunday.

1463
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:07,861
I'm maid of honor.

1464
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:12,867
You're my date, by the way,
so dress sharp.

1465
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:19,307
I'm supposed to help them
find someone to officiate,

1466
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:22,212
but I don't have a clue
where to start.

1467
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,342
This book is no help.

1468
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:27,751
You should just ask my dad.

1469
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,154
He has one of those
Universal Church of Life certificates.

1470
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:33,785
He used to do that stuff all the time
before he and Chad broke up.

1471
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:35,487
You think he'd do it?

1472
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:37,087
He might.

1473
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:41,161
For some crazy reason,
he really likes you.

1474
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:13,090
What on Earth are you doing?

1475
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,463
You can't marry Trevor.

1476
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,464
What are you talking about?

1477
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:17,867
Did he get you pregnant?

1478
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:19,803
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

1479
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:21,899
Well, then why else
would you be marrying him?

1480
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:23,305
I'm not marrying anyone.

1481
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:24,877
But the book.

1482
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,071
My moms are getting married
on Sunday.

1483
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:29,548
Your moms?

1484
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,618
Yeah. I was gonna call you.

1485
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:33,651
We want you to sing at the wedding.

1486
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:37,589
I mean, if you're not worried
about it spoiling your image.

1487
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:40,251
So, you're not really marrying Trevor?

1488
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,288
Get a grip, Lo.

1489
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,557
Hey, you wanna come in?

1490
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,225
I gotta go.

1491
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:00,044
Hey, kid.

1492
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:03,481
Trevor's not here.
Out picking up hookers, I think.

1493
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:04,483
Kidding.

1494
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:07,121
We always order in.

1495
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,222
What's up?

1496
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:11,986
I have a really big favor to ask.
Huge, actually.

1497
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,993
My moms are getting married
this Sunday,

1498
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:17,030
and we were hoping
that you would conduct the ceremony.

1499
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,497
Trevor's told me you've done it,
like, a million times.

1500
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:21,499
The little breeder sold me out!

1501
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:24,567
Would you do it? Please?

1502
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:27,107
I know you don't know them,
but that's kind of the point.

1503
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:29,607
We're new here, so we're inviting
lots of people we don't know

1504
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:31,144
so we can all
get to know each other better.

1505
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,043
Plus, you know me, right?
lt'll be fun.

1506
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:38,142
I hate weddings...
ever since Chad and I broke up.

1507
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:41,278
Happy couples make me nauseous.

1508
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:46,727
Well, if it's any consolation,
my moms fight all the time.

1509
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,227
There'll be liquor, right?

1510
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:49,727
Tons.

1511
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,161
Okay. I'm in.

1512
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:57,296
Although today's ceremony
does not yet have the power of law

1513
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:58,201
in this state,

1514
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:03,403
I believe that in the eyes of God...
or perhaps the Goddess...

1515
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:06,411
these two women
are already married.

1516
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:10,348
They have been since they committed
to love and cherish each other,

1517
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:13,785
since the day they decided
to raise a child together.

1518
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:16,254
They've been
through sickness and health.

1519
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:18,189
They've been through thick and thin.

1520
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:21,751
They've been through puberty.
They've been through all of it.

1521
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:24,354
And it's only made their love
grow stronger.

1522
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,729
Now, if that does not define
what a marriage is,

1523
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,269
I do not know what does define it.

1524
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:33,239
So, by the power vested in me
by the Internet...

1525
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,865
And this is legal.

1526
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:37,536
You could have gone to Vegas
and gotten an Elvis impersonator

1527
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:39,704
who would have charged you
a lot more money.

1528
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:45,083
I know pronounce you... committed.

1529
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:53,922
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1530
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:02,569
Come on! One more set!

1531
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,900
You can do it!
Come on! Come on!

1532
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:07,268
You are never going to believe this.

1533
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:08,409
Lo broke up with Tiffany,

1534
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:10,239
and there wasn't even a fight
or anything.

1535
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:13,347
Excuse me, ladies.
We are working.

1536
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:16,042
That clinches it.
Lo's definitely gay.

1537
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:21,881
What the hell
are you two talking about?

1538
01:24:22,023 --> 01:24:22,955
It's nothing, Coach.

1539
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,616
Where do you think he is today?

1540
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,556
A gay wedding!

1541
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:32,566
Get dressed.

1542
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:50,141
Go on. Talk to him.

1543
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:53,186
What? No, no.
I'm dancing with you.

1544
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:54,915
Technically.

1545
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:59,555
I'm sorry.
I just didn't think he'd come.

1546
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:00,992
You invited him, Tru.

1547
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:03,687
Go on. Ask him to dance.

1548
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:05,499
You don't mind?

1549
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:08,261
Sure, I mind, but it's better
than dancing with you

1550
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:09,597
while you're mooning at him.

1551
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:11,864
- I'm not mooning.
- Uh-huh.

1552
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:15,442
Just talk to him, okay?

1553
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:18,671
And maybe we can enjoy
the rest of the reception.

1554
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:21,580
Go.

1555
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:26,180
I didn't think you'd come.

1556
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:27,819
Neither did I.

1557
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:31,483
Hey, look who Dom
and Emmett brought to our wedding!

1558
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:33,458
You're David Kopay!

1559
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:34,721
Lo.

1560
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,055
The first pro athlete to come out.

1561
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:38,962
Back when we were kids.

1562
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,624
He was a pioneer.

1563
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:42,794
And I'm so glad things have changed,

1564
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:44,700
and there are
young gay athletes out there

1565
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,797
who don't feel a need to hide.

1566
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:50,670
Lo isn't actually out.

1567
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:52,871
He's here as a tourist.

1568
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:55,447
Let's get you something to drink.

1569
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:58,417
What?

1570
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:02,846
So, wanna dance?

1571
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:05,187
Okay.

1572
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:14,400
So, now you've been
to your first gay wedding.

1573
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:16,003
How does it feel?

1574
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:18,004
Weird.

1575
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:21,303
I don't...
Everybody just seems so normal.

1576
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,775
It's weird because everyone
seems so normal?

1577
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:25,402
You know what I mean. I mean...

1578
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:29,779
Okay, I was brought up to think that
gay people are weird and strange,

1579
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:32,614
but this wedding
was just like any other,

1580
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,620
except for no groom.

1581
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,523
Just swallow your pride.

1582
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:41,719
I, uh, broke it off with Tiffany.

1583
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:45,390
You were right. She was totally
falling for me, and it wasn't fair.

1584
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,025
I'm really proud of you.
That must have been hard.

1585
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:52,171
That living-on-the-down-low thing
sounded good for a while.

1586
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:55,367
I mean, my life is nobody else's
business, right? But...

1587
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:58,775
...I don't know how you do that
without hurting people.

1588
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,575
Like Walter...

1589
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,141
...and you.

1590
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:05,643
I'm fine.

1591
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,380
I just want you
to live a life you deserve.

1592
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:11,390
I don't want you sneaking around,
having sex in tree houses.

1593
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:13,926
Hey, that tree house is romantic!

1594
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:18,057
Hi. Mind if I cut in?

1595
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:20,327
Oh. Yeah, sure.

1596
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:23,767
Not her, silly.
You.

1597
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:24,667
Me?

1598
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:28,105
Hello! We're at a gay wedding.

1599
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:31,237
If we can't dance here,
where can we dance?

1600
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:33,612
Okay.

1601
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:41,747
Um, I thought you were mad at me.

1602
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:47,556
Mad doesn't even begin to cover it.

1603
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:51,563
If you wouldn't have danced with me,
I would have decked you.

1604
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:52,826
Well, you're a pretty good dancer,

1605
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,459
so it looks like I
made a good choice.

1606
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:07,506
Well, it looks like your dance card
is free again.

1607
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,944
May I?

1608
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:23,897
Son of a bitch.

1609
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:26,793
Get up, bastard!

1610
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:29,968
Lo, no!
You have nothing to prove! Lo!

1611
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:31,969
So, it's true, isn't it?

1612
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:35,509
Tiffany tried telling me you were
queer, and I wouldn't believe it.

1613
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:37,577
We grew up together, man!
You spent the night at my house!

1614
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:41,181
Man, it's not even what it looks like.
We were just goofing around.

1615
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,175
All right, then you tell me.
Are you a queer or not?

1616
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:49,013
Are you serious?

1617
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:51,255
Whatever.

1618
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,189
Rhonda says I can't call you "queer."

1619
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,057
Only queers get to use
the word "queer."

1620
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:04,427
Then, I guess I can say it.

1621
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:06,095
What the hell is this crap?

1622
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,167
You mean to tell me that I've got
a queer for a quarterback?

1623
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:12,872
Yeah, Coach, you do.

1624
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:15,345
Yeah, well, think again.
You're off the team!

1625
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:18,115
I don't think so, Coach.

1626
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:19,981
You see, that violates
district policy,

1627
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:21,953
not to mention common decency.

1628
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:25,183
you can reconsider that statement,

1629
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,850
or you can reconsider
your employment.

1630
01:29:26,994 --> 01:29:28,188
You go, girl!

1631
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:32,925
Uh, I mean, very well put, sir.

1632
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:46,409
You coming, Manny?

1633
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:56,256
He's my best friend, Coach.

1634
01:29:58,292 --> 01:30:00,157
Yeah. It figures.

1635
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:04,230
I'm surrounded
by a bunch of pansies!

1636
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,070
Thanks.

1637
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:18,805
Why didn't you tell me, man?

1638
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:21,073
You could have trusted me.
All you gotta do is talk to me.

1639
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:22,682
Talk to you?

1640
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:25,548
Manny, all you ever do is go on
about how much you hate fags.

1641
01:30:25,653 --> 01:30:27,018
Yeah, but I don't hate you.

1642
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:30,280
You're my boy, man.

1643
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,789
If this situation
was the other way around,

1644
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:33,588
I would've definitely trusted you
and come and told you.

1645
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:36,889
I... I'm sorry.
I didn't think you could handle it.

1646
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:38,465
Why? 'Cause you think
I'm an asshole?

1647
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,533
Um, you are kind of an asshole.

1648
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:43,932
Nobody asked you, guys.

1649
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:46,130
You just smack me upside the head
like you usually do

1650
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,468
and straighten me out, all right?

1651
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:50,067
-
- Oww!

1652
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:53,636
I didn't mean, like, right now, dick.

1653
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:57,206
I love you, man.
Nothing gonna change that.

1654
01:30:57,318 --> 01:30:59,980
Okay, everyone,
I think the show is over.

1655
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:04,289
Young man, I believe
we were promised a song.

1656
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:08,019
I don't know.
I only ever sung in church.

1657
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,027
Go!

1658
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:12,564
You nearly busted up this wedding.
I think you owe us a song.

1659
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:16,168
If it weren't such a cliché,
I'd suggest <i>I Will Survive.</i>

1660
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:19,834
Yeah, I don't know that one, but...

1661
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:22,876
Okay, I do have this thing
that I kind of wrote.

1662
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,537
Could I show the band?

1663
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,147
Hey, you know what really hurts?

1664
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:36,983
What?

1665
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,524
I spent hours in the gym
sculpting this amazing body,

1666
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:41,355
and I never saw Lo
check me out once.

1667
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:45,295
You are so vain.
You really should have been gay.

1668
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:46,991
It's a big loss to your community.

1669
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:50,228
Believe me, we're devastated.

1670
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:52,066
Mm-hmm.

1671
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:53,162

I got something to tell you.

-  Ah!

Don't say "ain't."
That's bad English.

is correct my grammar!

You ain't gay.

1753
01:38:05,613 --> 01:38:07,444
My mic...
my mic fell into my crotch.

1754
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:11,050
You just slap me upside the head
like you usually do

1755

I didn't mean right now, idiot.

1758
01:38:20,594 --> 01:38:23,461
Okay, then,
I guess we'll get started.

Oh. Oh, yeah.
Hold that, honey.

Oh, yeah. Push harder.

No, no, sorry. Very busy.
Don't have time.
