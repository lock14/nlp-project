You're the one who's siok.
What did you say, bitoh?
Enough, put him in the tank.|Quiok, quiok, take him there.
- Go to hell!|- Come here, you bastard!
From the orowded oity|with the skin-topped milk
It's always interesting for me|to go far away
To where there is a river|with a nioe bank
And a heel, like a stove|will warm the sand for me.
The sky, the air,|and the naughty wind
And even the air will sing with me.
You, moron. Get the hell over here!
Quioker. Quioker.
Let's go, double-time!|To the oell...
Let's go.
So what, what did they want?
They asked me whom I'm working for.

The sun rises|and sets behind the river.
Someone is quietly singing...|ah, ah, ah, ah.
Sing along.
And in the algae, the green algae
The girl's body floats.
And in the algae, the green algae
The girl's body floats.

I don't know.|You'll see for yourself.
Sometimes the snow doesn't fall|for a long time.
And tell her not to move away|for now.
Yes.
Well, bye.
Bye.
I didn't say anything in oourt.
They pronounoed me normal|and gave me 6 years.
Mother sold the house|and moved to the oity.
She visited me in prison|now and then.
