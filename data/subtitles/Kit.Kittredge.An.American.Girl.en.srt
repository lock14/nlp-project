00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:12,541
<i>It was May 2nd, 1934.</i>

2
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,257
<i>Even though the Great Depression</i>
<i>was in full swing around the world...</i>

3
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:19,205
<i>... it still seemed far away</i>
<i>from the world I knew.</i>

4
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:22,689
<i>I was focused on one thing.</i>

5
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:25,408
<i>I wanted to be a reporter.</i>

6
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:50,726
<i>I was more excited that day</i>
<i>than I'd ever been in my whole life.</i>

7
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,375
Next up, Clifton and Ludlow.
Everybody up for Clifton and Ludlow.

8
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:02,182
<i>If I hurried, I'd have just enough time</i>
<i>to see Dad at his car dealership.</i>

9
00:03:03,657 --> 00:03:06,689
Dad. Dad. Dad, look, I finished my article.

10
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:08,766
That's great, honey. Oh!

11
00:03:10,602 --> 00:03:12,707
- Wish me luck.
- You can do it, sweetheart.

12
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:14,336
Go get them.

13
00:03:16,393 --> 00:03:18,303
She's gonna be a reporter, that one.

14
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:19,619
You just wait and see.

15
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,650
Hobo crime spree
spreading across Ohio Valley.

16
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:26,883
Come get your paper. Hobo crime spree.

17
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:28,542
Hobo crime spree spreading...

18
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:31,780
<i>My brother Charlie</i>
<i>had arranged an introduction...</i>

19
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:34,976
<i>... at the</i> Cincinnati Register.

20
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:40,740
<i>Though I was going inside as a visitor...</i>

21
00:03:41,162 --> 00:03:44,773
<i>... I was certain I'd come out a journalist.</i>

22
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:51,969
<i>How could I have known</i>
<i>what life had in store?</i>

23
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,041
<i>I thought I was ready.</i>

24
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:57,189
Seven, please?

25
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:05,891
Excuse me, Mr. Peabody? Sir?

26
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:08,296
- Charlie Kittredge's sister.
- Yes, sir, I'm Kit.

27
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,039
Uh, Billy, and I'm only 19. I'm not
a sir yet. But thanks. Uh, follow me.

28
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:15,559
Charlie said you wanted
to see a real newsroom, and this is it.

29
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:17,732
Wow, the <i>Cincinnati Register.</i>

30
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:21,063
- Okay. So where's the editor?
- Uh, Gibson? Right there, why?

31
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:24,449
I've written this article,
and I'd like for you to give it to him.

32
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,360
- Uh, you'd like me to what?
- Give it to him, you know, to publish.

33
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:29,898
You're kidding.

34
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,485
You're not kidding. She's not kidding.

35
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:35,620
I'm not kidding.
It's about the Chicago World's Fair.

36
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:38,571
I've interviewed several people
who've actually been there.

37
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:39,812
Eyewitnesses.

38
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,500
Heh. That's what this is about?
You want an article published?

39
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:43,651
Yes, thank you.

40
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,571
Kid, you don't waltz up to the editor
of the <i>Cincinnati Register...</i>

41
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,449
...and expect him to publish your article.

42
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:55,210
The tragedy is the fact that
I paid you at all to write this drivel!

43
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:58,372
I want something new.
I want something fresh.

44
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,192
I want something real before I...

45
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:03,015
But how about I take a look at it?

46
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:05,287
Thanks, Billy, would you?

47
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:08,137
I'll just wait here.

48
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:10,375
- Ha, ha.
- But you take your time.

49
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,851
Uh, no.

50
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:14,502
You can come back another time.

51
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:16,585
That works too.

52
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,178
<i>He's just reading it, Ruthie.</i>

53
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,586
He might not even give it to Mr. Gibson.
Who knows?

54
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,782
- You're late. Let's go.
- Does Mother know you're coming with me?

55
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,211
Mother,
I'm going to Kit's house with Frances!

56
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:29,763
- Yes, dear.
- Now she does.

57
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:36,484
Good day.

58
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:38,925
Come on, let's go.

59
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:41,191
<i>I'm being sworn</i>
<i>Into the Treehouse Club</i>

60
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:44,174
- <i>I'm being sworn into the Treehouse Club.</i>
- Afternoon.

61
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,045
Hello.

62
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:51,078
You all know if the people who live here
might be interested in a barter?

63
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:53,614
Depends.
- What's a barter?

64
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:54,758
A trade.

65
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:57,997
See, my partner here and I'll work for food
and...

66
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,291
- Anyways, I'm Will, and this is Countee.
- Hey.

67
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:04,687
Mother's out back with her Garden Club.
Follow me.

68
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:07,216
<i>I'm being sworn</i>
<i>Into the Treehouse Club.</i>

69
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:11,020
Everything will be okay.
Everything will be fine.

70
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,142
I just heard you're moving, Louise.

71
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,555
My husband left weeks ago...

72
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:23,502
...and we're staying at the Netherland
until he sends for us.

73
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:25,639
The Netherland Plaza Hotel?

74
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,302
I heard it's magnificent.

75
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:29,000
We'd love to see the rooms.

76
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,147
Margaret, look.

77
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:32,458
Mother.

78
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,145
Hobos. We cannot trust them.

79
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:39,526
Hello.

80
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:40,942
How can I help you?

81
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:45,132
- Mother, this is Will and his friend...
- Countee.

82
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:48,614
And they're looking to make a barter,
which means work for food.

83
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:50,728
I can pretty much fix anything broke.

84
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,840
Windows, uh...

85
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,140
...fences, any kind of machine.

86
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:58,924
We're trustworthy and responsible.

87
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,683
Come back in the morning.

88
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:03,245
- We'll see what we can do.
- Thank you.

89
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,322
One moment.

90
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,065
Don't feed them, Margaret.

91
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:12,938
Why don't you take
something to eat before you leave?

92
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:15,244
Thank you, ma'am,
but, uh, we only take when we work.

93
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,096
I can't let you leave hungry.

94
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:20,910
Better be quick. I've already seen
Mrs. Culver dive headfirst into the nuts.

95
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:23,815
Who knows what she'll do
when she sees the sandwiches?

96
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,739
Please, take it as an advance.

97
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,659
Go on.

98
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:30,194
All right, as an advance. Thank you.

99
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:33,420
- We'll be working it off in the morning.
- See you then.

100
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,947
Let's go, Countee.
- Ahem.

101
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:40,876
My husband says let them go hungry.
It's the only way to keep them out of town.

102
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:42,504
Oh, Louise.

103
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:45,673
Can't help but think
that those boys are someone's children too.

104
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:47,054
Hmm.

105
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,556
Will, come on.

106
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:53,806
Okay, everybody. In your places.

107
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:56,910
"Member-o-belia."

108
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:00,979
Eleanor Roosevelt. Amelia Earhart.

109
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,404
Kit, Ruthie, Frances...

110
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:06,094
...and soon, Florence.

111
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:08,017
Do you, Florence Stone...

112
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:12,048
...swear to be true to the Treehouse Club
and only the Treehouse Club...

113
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:14,508
...as long as you shall live?

114
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:15,985
I do.

115
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:20,339
And if anyone should ask you
to join the 9th Street Club?

116
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:23,408
I will laugh in their faces.

117
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:26,443
You're supposed to say, "I will decline."

118
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:28,746
I will decline...

119
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,738
...and laugh.
- Ha, ha.

120
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:36,270
Now Ruthie will get the sacred water
off the sacred shelf.

121
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:38,543
I already did. It's in the sacred bowl.

122
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,242
Good.

123
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:44,368
Now Treehouse members
and potential Treehouse members...

124
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:48,147
...take your right hand,
and place it in the bowl.

125
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,661
We are one.

126
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:57,429
Now place two fingers
over your heart, like so...

127
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:01,168
...for the sacred Treehouse pledge.

128
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:03,187
All together:

129
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:06,036
Gwanga, gwanga, galoolie...

130
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,198
...kariba, kariba, kariv.

131
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:11,701
- I swear to be true to the...
- Betty Lou!

132
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:13,487
Robert, do something!

133
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,037
Sir...?
- Yep.

134
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,050
We're gonna be okay then.
- No, save that.

135
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:23,279
- Frances, look.
- That's your bed.

136
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:25,203
- What does that mean?
- My furniture.

137
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,815
"Foreclosure by order of the bank."

138
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:30,990
That means
the bank's taking our house away.

139
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,614
Ruthie, isn't that your father's bank?

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,105
Can you ask your father to give it back?

141
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:42,647
Just let them go. Betty Lou!
Just let them go.

142
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:49,043
Oh, what a pity. I had no idea.

143
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,510
Well, he lost his job months ago,
Lorraine.

144
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:54,226
They've been selling eggs just to get by.

145
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:59,181
- Will you excuse me?
- You just let them go, okay?

146
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:00,757
Come on, let's go.

147
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:04,467
But my picture's not up
on the member-o-belia wall yet.

148
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:06,291
Florence.

149
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,318
Everybody's watching, Lou.

150
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,456
Betty Lou.

151
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:25,808
Oh, I'm so sorry.

152
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:27,865
Come on.
- Where will they go?

153
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,881
I don't know.

154
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,551
I'm so sorry, Barbara.

155
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:50,297
There she is. How's my girl?

156
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,020
- Dad, Dad.
- Come here.

157
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:58,194
- What's the matter?
- Dad, look.

158
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,224
"The Stones lose their house."

159
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,906
<i>And that's why my</i>
<i>favorite stories are fairy tales...</i>

160
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:13,911
...because no matter how scary it gets...

161
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,115
...everybody always lives happily
ever after.

162
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:19,800
And often with some very nice outfits.

163
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:26,617
Thank you, Ruthie. Thank you.
Thank you, Ruthie.

164
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:30,906
Does, uh... Does anyone know
where Frances Stone is?

165
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:32,213
She's away.

166
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,747
Staying with family.

167
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:38,106
- Yeah, in a hobo jungle somewhere.
- Stop it, Roger.

168
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,920
Frances Stone is a good-for-nothing,
deadbeat egg seller...

169
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:43,932
...and everyone knows it.
She wore dresses made of feed sacks.

170
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:47,191
Roger. Ruthie, not another word.

171
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:50,521
Well, this seems like an opportune time
to let you know...

172
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:53,404
...that as a final class assignment
before summer vacation...

173
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,803
...we're going to help out
at a soup kitchen...

174
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,203
...where they provide food
for the poor and needy.

175
00:11:58,366 --> 00:11:59,861
Uh, Roger.

176
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:02,036
My dad says that people
eat at soup kitchens...

177
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:05,500
...are hobos who feed off the government.
That's why we're in a depression.

178
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,739
I understand, Roger.

179
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:11,130
Therefore,
anyone who doesn't wish to help out...

180
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:14,677
...can write a 1 500- word essay
on the history of volunteerism.

181
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,189
Roger's leading my team
for the soup kitchen.

182
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:20,502
Why, he's a nice boy.

183
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:25,012
He's a horrible boy. He just didn't want
to have to do that paper.

184
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,151
Mother, look. She's all alone.

185
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,458
Oh. Poor thing.

186
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,892
"Grace. Can't feed her anymore."

187
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,100
Can we take her?

188
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:44,758
Wha...? No.

189
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,270
She can be my birthday present for this year
and next year...

190
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,520
...and forever.

191
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,379
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

192
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:56,829
Wha...? What's that, Grace?

193
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:59,163
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

194
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:02,268
Okay, I'll tell her.

195
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:05,398
She said she'll be very quiet
and only eat scraps...

196
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,161
- Mm-hm.
- and be the very best dog...

197
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,636
...you could ever hope to have.

198
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,445
Can we at least bring her home
for one teeny-weeny meaningless night?

199
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,779
How can you say no to that face?

200
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:21,085
Mother.

201
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:23,198
Please, please, please.

202
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,402
All right, but one night only.

203
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:29,243
She said yes. She said yes.
You're coming home.

204
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:33,562
I'll take care of you. Don't worry.

205
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:38,429
Help! Stop him!

206
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:40,927
Help, stop, stop him.
- Help!

207
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:43,424
Stop him. Police.
- What happened?

208
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:46,401
Did you see that? In broad daylight.

209
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:48,668
- He took my wallet.
- Are you all right?

210
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:51,424
Yes, ma'am.
- What color was your wallet?

211
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:54,522
It was red. My son made it for me.

212
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,478
Did you see that tattoo on his arm?

213
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:58,747
It was odd. Something like a bird, maybe.

214
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:01,278
It was so fast,
I didn't really get to see it all.

215
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:05,598
All I noticed was that he was a hobo.

216
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:09,570
Get your dog.

217
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,629
I had a late lunch today, Margaret.

218
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,420
Save it for leftovers.

219
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:25,567
- Uncle Hendrick, more meatloaf?
- Thank you, no.

220
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:29,080
I'll tell you this, Jack, keep supporting
your president and his New Deal...

221
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:31,673
...and you'll see what'll happen
to this country.

222
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:33,054
Your own son quit college.

223
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,929
Well, he didn't quit. He postponed.
Right, Dad?

224
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:40,027
To join one of these newfangled programs.

225
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:44,899
CCC is a great program, Hendrick.
Charlie is building parks and fixing roads...

226
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:48,639
And sending money home
because business is a little slow.

227
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:51,262
There's no shame
in families helping each other.

228
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,055
Hmm.

229
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:55,489
Hard to think of you this way, Margaret.

230
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:57,594
Saving leftovers.

231
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:00,289
We like leftovers.

232
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:05,978
- I should be leaving.
- Oh, no. Please. Stay longer.

233
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:08,418
Ha-ha-ha.
You think I'm the voice of doom, Jack.

234
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,330
But I'll tell you this.
When people live beyond their means...

235
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,046
...in houses that are too big
for their pockets...

236
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,123
What's that noise?

237
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:20,187
Oh, you haven't met our newest addition,
Grace.

238
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:22,658
She's normally very quiet,
Uncle Hendrick.

239
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,669
Except for when she snores.
- And the drool.

240
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,987
It seems to me the last thing you need
is another mouth to feed.

241
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,186
Well, luckily, she doesn't eat very much.

242
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:35,811
Come on, Grace. Come on.

243
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:38,723
Good girl.

244
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,852
Shouldn't you fellows be getting on back
to wherever it is you live?

245
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:49,150
Yes, sir.

246
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,020
What's the capital of North Dakota?
Quick.

247
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,204
Bismarck.

248
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:57,280
Make sure your mother
doesn't work too hard.

249
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:18,046
I can't believe that none of
these people have money for food.

250
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:22,080
You come over here and chop that bread up
for everybody...

251
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,615
...back of the line, right there.

252
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:47,907
- Would you like some bread?
- Thanks, sweetheart.

253
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,598
Excuse me.

254
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:18,079
Dad.

255
00:17:58,124 --> 00:17:59,367
Tried.

256
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:06,217
How is she?

257
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,933
Uh, she's... She's up in the tree house.

258
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:18,603
Kit.

259
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,396
Kit, I know you're up there.

260
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:27,081
I understand if you're angry with me...

261
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:29,132
...or, uh, embarrassed.

262
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,578
Please come down, sweetheart.
I'd like to explain.

263
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,378
Kit.

264
00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:03,207
Kit.

265
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,386
Why were you there, Dad?

266
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,929
The bank took the car dealership.

267
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,829
- Ruthie's father did that to us?
- Kit.

268
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,711
This isn't personal.

269
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:27,336
Are we gonna lose the house?

270
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:30,792
We're gonna be fine.

271
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,380
Where's our car?

272
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,342
Daddy.

273
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:48,266
We're gonna be okay.

274
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:52,965
Hey, Kit, your father good enough
to eat at the soup kitchen? Ha, ha!

275
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:54,281
Just ignore them.

276
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:57,383
And now Kit will probably start
raising chickens, selling eggs...

277
00:19:57,552 --> 00:20:02,058
...and wearing feed-sack dresses,
just like Frances did.

278
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:03,718
What's a feed-sack dress?

279
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:06,790
It's a dress made out of the bag
that chicken feed comes in.

280
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:08,878
Are you really gonna wear one, Kit?

281
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,910
Sure she will.
Right after her family starts selling eggs.

282
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,735
We're not egg sellers.

283
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:16,207
And then it's just one step
before the poorhouse.

284
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,457
Come get your chicken and
your eggs from Kit Kittredge. Bock, bock!

285
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:26,218
You're all a bunch of freeloaders.

286
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:30,893
Why don't you come over here
and say that to my face, Roger.

287
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:34,473
Okay. You're all a bunch of freeloaders!

288
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:36,780
What's that you've got behind you?

289
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:43,207
Got any eggs? Bock, bock, bock!

290
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:45,352
How much for the eggs, Roger?

291
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,238
Bock, bock, bock!
Look at Mr. Feather Pants.

292
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,890
Ha-ha-ha!
- And how's our mural...

293
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:53,768
...coming?

294
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:57,516
But, Mother, it was Roger's fault.
- Oh, Kit.

295
00:20:57,682 --> 00:21:00,616
Please don't take everything
people say so personally.

296
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,563
Everyone's in trouble these days.

297
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:06,382
In fact, we've had to move
your things into the attic.

298
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:09,160
The attic? Why?

299
00:21:09,331 --> 00:21:12,331
Your mother and I have decided
we're gonna take in boarders.

300
00:21:13,684 --> 00:21:15,953
Boarders? Like...

301
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,326
...strangers?

302
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:22,859
That are gonna come and live in our house
and eat our food and sit on our sofa?

303
00:21:23,188 --> 00:21:25,742
There's no shame in it, honey.

304
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:28,014
Lots of people are doing it to get by.

305
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,416
We're not gonna start selling eggs,
are we?

306
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:32,467
Ha, ha. We hadn't planned on it.

307
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,333
This is only temporary, sweetheart,
I promise.

308
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:37,810
You know...

309
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:39,215
...once I get to Chicago...

310
00:21:39,604 --> 00:21:43,313
...I'll find a good-paying job,
just as quick as you can say "Plymouth."

311
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:44,653
Chicago?

312
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:46,606
What? You're leaving?

313
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,201
- I have some good leads in...
- No.

314
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:49,869
- No.
- Kit.

315
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,425
You said we were going to be okay.

316
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:55,051
We're not okay if we're not together.

317
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:09,646
Ah.

318
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:11,123
Don't let it beat you, Kit.

319
00:22:13,718 --> 00:22:15,212
You know, when I was about 14...

320
00:22:15,606 --> 00:22:19,664
...my dad traded some old farm equipment
for a used Model T.

321
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,317
One time I was cranking it, to start it...

322
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:25,557
...and the crank broke in half.

323
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:29,009
Car kind of groaned,
and it just died right in our front yard.

324
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:32,526
I wanted to junk the darn thing
when my dad walked in...

325
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:35,821
...and he said,
"Don't let it beat you, son."

326
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:38,260
Don't let it beat you.

327
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:41,619
Drove it for five more years after that.

328
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,485
So whether it's an old Model T...

329
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,052
...or a typewriter ribbon...

330
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:53,012
...or going to Chicago to find work...

331
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,031
...we can't let it beat us, sweetheart.

332
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:01,134
Come on.

333
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:03,409
It's time for bed.

334
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,459
What if you don't come back?

335
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,036
I, Jack Kittredge...

336
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,215
...do solemnly swear...

337
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,550
...that I will write you once a week.

338
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:32,945
And that there is nothing in this world...

339
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:35,348
...that could ever keep me
from coming back to you.

340
00:23:36,825 --> 00:23:39,060
Do you promise, Dad?

341
00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:40,849
Really promise?

342
00:23:41,368 --> 00:23:43,223
I do.

343
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:46,613
Gwanga, gwanga, galoolie...

344
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:51,984
Kariba, kariba, kariv.

345
00:23:57,113 --> 00:23:59,284
I love you, Dad.

346
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:03,665
- I love you.
- I love you too, sweetheart.

347
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:19,765
<i>Bye.</i>

348
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:40,176
<i>June 17th, 1934. Dear Dad.</i>

349
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:45,426
<i>Thanks for the letter. We miss you too</i>
<i>and hope you're finding work in Chicago.</i>

350
00:24:45,596 --> 00:24:47,156
<i>Here at home, things are hopping.</i>

351
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:50,868
<i>School's out, and I can't call my friends</i>
<i>because the phone's been disconnected.</i>

352
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:52,017
No phone?

353
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:56,049
<i>So now all I do is clean</i>
<i>and sweep and fold...</i>

354
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:58,772
<i>... and iron and wipe and cook.</i>

355
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,974
<i>And fold and clean and sweep and iron</i>
<i>and wipe and cook some more.</i>

356
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,035
<i>My grand plans for being a real reporter</i>
<i>are kind of on the back burner.</i>

357
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:09,433
<i>Don't get me wrong, Dad.</i>
<i>I'm not complaining. I'm just...</i>

358
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:12,466
<i>... well, complaining.</i>

359
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:17,107
<i>The house is chock-full of boarders,</i>
<i>which keeps us pretty busy.</i>

360
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,141
<i>Mrs. Howard and her son, Stirling,</i>
<i>moved into my bedroom.</i>

361
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:24,889
We're almost there, lamby.

362
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,149
Lamby.

363
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,672
<i>It's going to be strange</i>
<i>having a boy from my class living here.</i>

364
00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:33,527
<i>But I guess I'll get used to it.</i>

365
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,145
<i>Mother moved into the sewing room</i>
<i>so we can squeeze in another border.</i>

366
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:39,098
<i>I thought that was very clever of her.</i>

367
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:41,556
<i>Now your room belongs to Miss Dooley...</i>

368
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:45,369
<i>... a dance instructor</i>
<i>who likes to practice her steps out back.</i>

369
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:48,500
<i>Though, I'm not at all sure</i>
<i>Mrs. Howard approves.</i>

370
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:52,051
<i>Did you know Mother</i>
<i>divided the living room in half...</i>

371
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:55,004
<i>... to make room for Miss Bond,</i>
<i>a mobile librarian who moved in last week?</i>

372
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:59,133
<i>Now, if she can only learn the difference</i>
<i>between the gas and the brake...</i>

373
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:02,772
Oh, take cover!

374
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:05,111
<i>We'll all breathe a little easier.</i>

375
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:13,914
Where'd everyone go?

376
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:15,999
<i>You'll be happy to know</i>
<i>we've been using...</i>

377
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,028
<i>... Aunt Millie's Waste Not, Want Not tips</i>
<i>to make meals stretch.</i>

378
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:21,621
<i>Like cutting one piece of toast</i>
<i>into four triangles...</i>

379
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:24,028
<i>... to make a whole loaf</i>
<i>go for three meals.</i>

380
00:26:24,895 --> 00:26:26,323
<i>Mother says it's magic.</i>

381
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:29,844
- <i>But the real magician is our newest arrival...</i>
- Jefferson J. Berk...

382
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:35,414
...master of misdirection, dean of deception,
and escape artist extraordinaire.

383
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:38,551
Observe.
I need a volunteer from the audience.

384
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:41,046
Young man.

385
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:43,484
- What's your name?
- Stirling.

386
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:44,825
Stirling.

387
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:47,130
- Do you mind wearing these for a while?
- No. No.

388
00:26:47,295 --> 00:26:48,473
Come with me.

389
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,391
Notice the strong solid-steel cuffs.
Can you get out of that?

390
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,382
- Are you sure? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

391
00:26:56,544 --> 00:26:57,755
- Are you sure?
- Ha, ha!

392
00:26:57,921 --> 00:27:00,987
The only thing that can get you out of that
is this key.

393
00:27:01,474 --> 00:27:03,383
We hope.
Sometimes it doesn't work though.

394
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:05,974
And then we have to cut you out of it.

395
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:10,070
Oh, there we are. All right, now,
would you hold this key for me, please?

396
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:11,256
Yes.

397
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:14,560
Don't lose it.
Will you put these on my wrists, please?

398
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:16,062
Yes.

399
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:19,451
Now.

400
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,560
Would you like me to free myself
from these?

401
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:25,819
With brute force or with magic?

402
00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:27,926
- Magic.
- Magic.

403
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:30,431
All right, then. All right, then.

404
00:27:31,105 --> 00:27:33,080
Let's count. See how long it takes.

405
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:39,196
One, two, three...

406
00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:42,589
Wow.

407
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,299
Wow!

408
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:49,666
- How'd you do that?
- It's magic.

409
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:54,465
<i>And, Dad, please remember,</i>
<i>I miss you more than you know.</i>

410
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:58,239
<i>We all do. Never forget that.</i>

411
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:02,076
Hi.

412
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,312
Hi.

413
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:08,576
Sorry.

414
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:10,425
Allergies.

415
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:12,511
These are from your room.

416
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,297
Uh, just leave them there.

417
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:17,248
I'll put them away.

418
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:25,695
Is that...

419
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:28,060
...Ernie Lombardi?

420
00:28:28,227 --> 00:28:29,569
Yep.

421
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,864
A picture of the Schnoz.

422
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:36,704
Did you know
that he's the biggest player on the team?

423
00:28:36,868 --> 00:28:39,585
Six-foot-three, 230 pounds.

424
00:28:39,748 --> 00:28:40,958
He's my favorite.

425
00:28:41,123 --> 00:28:44,091
That's funny. He's got a huge nose
and you've got...

426
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:45,689
Huge ears.

427
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,995
- I know.
- Ha, ha.

428
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:50,019
That's why I like him.

429
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:54,243
I'm sorry we put you out of your room.

430
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:57,217
That's all right.
I can get more writing done here.

431
00:28:57,926 --> 00:29:00,379
- What do you write?
- News articles.

432
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:04,574
- For your family?
- And for the <i>Cincinnati Register.</i>

433
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:06,785
You write for the newspaper?

434
00:29:08,421 --> 00:29:12,098
Well, I haven't been in "print" print yet.
But I hope to be.

435
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:15,360
My brother's friend is a big reporter
for the <i>Register.</i>

436
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:17,382
Sorry, kiddo, not for the <i>Register.</i>

437
00:29:17,543 --> 00:29:20,192
But everyone wants to know
about the Chicago World's Fair.

438
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:24,514
Everyone and their second cousin's written
about the Chicago World's Fair.

439
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:28,833
- You know what Mr. Gibson says?
- Yeah, yeah, do it.

440
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:39,362
I want something new.
I want something fresh.

441
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:42,244
I want something real.
Don't sugarcoat your stories, boys.

442
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,790
This is the <i>Cincinnati Register,</i>
a beacon of cold, clear light...

443
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,925
...in a sea of sentimental flop.

444
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:52,417
So, what were you saying, Mr?

445
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:56,513
Uh, Peabody.
Sir, uh, William Peabody and nothing.

446
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,045
- I was just quoting you, sir.
- Oh.

447
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:01,762
Wait, Mr. Gibson.

448
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:03,267
Well.

449
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:06,336
Hello, sweetie, what's your name?

450
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:08,957
Kit Kittredge.
Well, actually, it's Margaret Mildred...

451
00:30:09,128 --> 00:30:12,990
...after my mother and an aunt. But when
I was younger, my father used to sing:

452
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,903
<i>Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag</i>

453
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,594
And it sort of stuck.

454
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:20,831
Sir.

455
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,942
- Fascinating.
- Wait.

456
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,521
I wrote an article
I think you should publish.

457
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:28,637
Oh.

458
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:31,525
Well, thank you very much.

459
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:35,134
And, by the way, I don't lisp.

460
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:05,188
Whoopsy daisy.

461
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:09,631
Whoo! Are you all right?

462
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:11,908
Uh, yeah, as long as that horn works.

463
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:14,497
Ha, ha. Now, can I interest you in a book?

464
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:20,161
- I don't have much time for reading.
- Well, you should take the time to read.

465
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,106
It's a wonderful way
to go wherever you want.

466
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:27,945
I've just finished reading this one.

467
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:30,311
<i>The Adventures of Robin Hood?</i>

468
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:33,258
He steals from the rich,
and then he gives to the poor.

469
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,200
And then what happened to him?
- Well, he'll have to tell you.

470
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:38,402
What about you, Countee?
Would you like one?

471
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:40,162
I can only read Hobo.

472
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,110
Oh, I've never tried that. Hmm.

473
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:46,275
How about I teach you to read books,
and you teach me to read Hobo?

474
00:31:46,443 --> 00:31:47,851
That'd be swell, Stirling.

475
00:31:49,612 --> 00:31:50,725
How about this one?

476
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,836
Thank you.

477
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:58,530
- It's a loaner, though.
- Okay.

478
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,227
Will?

479
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,390
- Are you okay?
- Ha, ha.

480
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,604
Will?

481
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:15,561
I want you to have
Mr. Kittredge's old boots.

482
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:17,606
No, ma'am, I couldn't.

483
00:32:17,772 --> 00:32:20,707
You've done wonderful work.
Beyond what you and Countee have eaten.

484
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:24,226
I insist you take these
before those things fall off your feet.

485
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:27,948
Thank you.

486
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:29,611
Go on.

487
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:34,380
- Miss Bond.
- Mrs. Kittredge.

488
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:36,068
Will.

489
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:38,952
Ruthie.

490
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:43,142
Hi, Ruthie. What's wrong?

491
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:46,092
- Morning.
- We're going on vacation.

492
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,670
Myrtle Beach, 10 days, starting Friday.

493
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,350
- And that's bad because...?
- It's so much more fun here.

494
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:56,333
You're all I ever talk about at home.
Even ask my mom.

495
00:32:56,494 --> 00:32:58,600
The other day,
I was telling her about you, Miss Dooley.

496
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,327
Aw, thank you.

497
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:02,949
She didn't say
what she was saying about you.

498
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:08,747
You know what you need? A novelette.

499
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:10,763
What are you writing?

500
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:13,347
You just gave me a great idea
for an article.

501
00:33:13,517 --> 00:33:16,006
I wanna write it down before I forget.

502
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:17,611
Here.

503
00:33:18,318 --> 00:33:21,352
I'll do this for you, and you go type it up
before you forget, okay?

504
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:24,364
- Are you sure?
- Go.

505
00:33:24,975 --> 00:33:27,277
Thanks, Ruthie.
- I have just the thing.

506
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,207
They fit real good.

507
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:34,598
Thank you.

508
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:38,888
Pretty.

509
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:46,671
Wish me luck.

510
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:50,830
Who is it?

511
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:52,716
Margaret Mildred Kittredge.

512
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,487
- What do you want?
- To be in print.

513
00:33:56,945 --> 00:33:59,563
Well, how do I say this nicely?

514
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:07,500
- But you haven't even read it!
- She's sorry, Mr. Gibson.

515
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,868
- Come on, Kit.
- Yeah, that's right, I am sorry.

516
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:14,888
I'm sorry you can't recognize a good story
when it's standing right outside your door.

517
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,555
What did you say?

518
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:22,379
Portrait of a boarding house, sir.
It's fresh. It's new. It's real.

519
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:26,769
What you're holding in your hand, sir,
is the story you've been looking for.

520
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,639
And you can throw me out if you want,
but I suggest that you read it first.

521
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,393
"A Kid's-Eye View of the Depression
in Cincinnati."

522
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:35,593
By Kit Kittredge, age 10.

523
00:34:35,762 --> 00:34:38,064
Ha, ha.
- That's enough.

524
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:01,994
You wrote this?

525
00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:04,049
Yes.

526
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,313
It's not bad.

527
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:11,505
Are you going to print it, Mr. Gibson?
- I'm sorry, kid.

528
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:14,092
"Not bad" is good...

529
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:15,853
...but it's not good enough.

530
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,714
Keep it up, kid.
We pay a penny a word for freelance.

531
00:35:22,227 --> 00:35:25,969
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

532
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,423
And guess what.
They pay a penny a word.

533
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:32,686
Which means, I can make two
or three dollars from just one article.

534
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:35,088
Whoo-ee!

535
00:35:35,252 --> 00:35:38,962
I was thinking about doing a story
on you and Countee, Will, if you let me.

536
00:35:39,189 --> 00:35:40,683
What's so interesting about us?

537
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,570
I'd like to find out,
shadow you for the day.

538
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:46,799
- That's reporter talk.
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:50,348
Well, actually, I'm on my way out
to get a few things...

540
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:51,761
...at my camp.

541
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,684
You can come if you'd like.

542
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:57,170
Unless you need us here, Mother.

543
00:35:57,397 --> 00:35:58,892
No, I can manage.

544
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,136
Come on, Countee.

545
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,834
Ruthie, Stirling.
Would you like to be my assistants?

546
00:36:10,262 --> 00:36:12,050
- Do we get paid?
- No.

547
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:14,349
- Okay.
- Yeah.

548
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:18,479
Will, Countee was saying something
about reading Hobo signs?

549
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:21,516
You know, he can read a sign
on a gatepost about 200 yards out.

550
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:25,646
- He's saved my hide about a hundred times.
- What kind of sign's on a gatepost?

551
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:27,855
The ones that hobos leave
to help each other.

552
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:31,218
- You see that?
- Looks like a cat.

553
00:36:31,382 --> 00:36:33,871
It is a cat. It's a good sign too.

554
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:36,466
It means a kind lady lives here.

555
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:40,498
- Not many houses want hobos, you know.
- You had a cat on your gate, Kit.

556
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:45,298
- We had a cat.
- Well, I live over there. Do I have a cat?

557
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:48,366
- Oh, I hope we have a cat.
- I'm sure you have a cat.

558
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:52,556
Sorry, Ruthie. No cat.

559
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,440
But you do have fish bones, see?

560
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:59,793
- Oh, what's that mean?
- Good garbage.

561
00:37:04,695 --> 00:37:07,412
So, what's it like riding the rails, Will?

562
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,234
Train whistles.

563
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,696
Engines smokes up,
and you run and you jump.

564
00:37:13,112 --> 00:37:15,730
And you let it take you
to a whole new life.

565
00:37:16,345 --> 00:37:19,279
- Makes a man feel free. Right, Countee?
- That's right.

566
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:21,780
So where's home, Will?

567
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:23,700
Uh...

568
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:25,556
Texas.

569
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:28,784
We had a farm.
Crops failed two years in a row.

570
00:37:28,953 --> 00:37:31,058
Daddy fought to keep it,
but when he couldn't...

571
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:34,608
...they headed out west with Belle
and Evelyn and my younger sisters.

572
00:37:34,778 --> 00:37:36,469
They wanted me to go too...

573
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:39,382
...but I figured it was time for me
to strike out on my own...

574
00:37:39,544 --> 00:37:43,702
...so I rode the rails, uh, made a few friends
and worked when I could.

575
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:48,693
That's when I met Countee and his father
in Oklahoma about 14 months ago.

576
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:50,996
Kind of stuck together after that.

577
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:53,683
- Called ourselves...
- "The Three Musketeers."

578
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:57,075
- Ha, ha.
- Yes, we did.

579
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:01,552
And, um...

580
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:06,129
And then the influenza came.

581
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:09,304
And my daddy didn't make it.

582
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:14,615
Now it's just us.

583
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:17,300
Thank the good Lord I've got him.

584
00:38:17,627 --> 00:38:21,009
Soon we're gonna make it out to California
and meet the rest of the family.

585
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:22,673
Are they gonna like me?

586
00:38:25,146 --> 00:38:26,554
No.

587
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:32,218
I'm just playing. Come on, let's go.

588
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:34,421
Let's get going.

589
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:38,644
You know what that means?

590
00:38:39,227 --> 00:38:40,633
Does it mean we're close?

591
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:42,705
That means we're near a hobo jungle.

592
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,599
What is a hobo, exactly?

593
00:38:44,764 --> 00:38:47,862
A person who hops the rails,
going from town to town looking for work.

594
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:50,353
Like a lot of these folks right here.

595
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:56,091
Here it is. Home sweet home.

596
00:38:56,731 --> 00:38:57,812
Come on.

597
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:04,694
<i>Life inside a hobo jungle sure isn't easy.</i>

598
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,763
<i>These people once had houses and jobs.</i>

599
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:10,388
<i>I guess we're all just a few strokes</i>
<i>of bad luck away...</i>

600
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,312
<i>... from being in that exact same spot.</i>

601
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:13,458
Eddie, down there.

602
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:15,384
<i>Every day's a challenge for food.</i>

603
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:17,883
<i>In most camps,</i>
<i>hobos share what they have:</i>

604
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:21,875
<i>Vegetables, potatoes</i>
<i>and, on a good day, maybe meat.</i>

605
00:39:22,046 --> 00:39:24,216
Would you mind if I took
a couple pictures of you?

606
00:39:24,382 --> 00:39:25,657
Of course you can.

607
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:29,946
<i>They put it in a pot and cook it</i>
<i>all together and call it hobo stew.</i>

608
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,347
- <i>Those that can contribute do.</i>
- Did you get meat?

609
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,641
<i>Those that can't</i>
<i>try harder the next day.</i>

610
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,108
<i>But everyone's welcome to share.</i>

611
00:39:39,038 --> 00:39:40,533
<i>They even have a hobo store...</i>

612
00:39:40,702 --> 00:39:43,638
<i>... where you leave what you don't want</i>
<i>and take what you do.</i>

613
00:39:46,015 --> 00:39:49,627
<i>For the most part, they seem like</i>
<i>a trustworthy group of people.</i>

614
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,541
<i>But trouble must follow them a lot.</i>

615
00:39:52,703 --> 00:39:55,768
<i>The first sign a hobo learns is danger.</i>

616
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:00,918
<i>They needed to protect themselves...</i>

617
00:40:01,086 --> 00:40:02,941
<i>... and each other.</i>

618
00:40:04,062 --> 00:40:06,933
<i>When times are tough,</i>
<i>people like to blame someone.</i>

619
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:10,458
<i>And hobos are an easy target, I guess.</i>

620
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:16,990
Here we are.

621
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:20,149
Bedroom.

622
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,775
Uh, lounge.

623
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:23,926
Bathroom.

624
00:40:26,337 --> 00:40:28,890
- Library.
Come on in.

625
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,414
You actually sleep here?
- Hi, doc.

626
00:40:31,584 --> 00:40:32,794
Will.

627
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:34,716
How's that throat of Countee's?

628
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:37,847
- Oh, it's doing much better. Thank you.
- Good.

629
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:39,477
Robin Hood, huh?

630
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:41,049
Yeah.

631
00:40:41,217 --> 00:40:43,551
Hey, uh...
Doc, what do you think about a person...

632
00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:46,528
...who steals from the rich
and gives to the poor?

633
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,629
Is he a good guy or a bad guy?

634
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,211
I'd have to say a good one.

635
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,374
Yeah, me too.

636
00:40:57,472 --> 00:40:58,934
See you, doc.

637
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,925
Will.

638
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:04,223
Hey. Y'all come out here.
I got someone to introduce you to.

639
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:05,728
Okay.
- Okay.

640
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,416
Welcome.

641
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:11,771
Sheldon Pennington III.

642
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:17,432
- Stirling Howard IV.
- Kit Kittredge I.

643
00:41:17,665 --> 00:41:18,843
I'm Ruthie.

644
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,148
- We're friends of Will and Countee.
- Ah.

645
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:24,610
Pennington's the name,
stocks and bonds were my game.

646
00:41:25,698 --> 00:41:27,488
My father used to be in stocks too.

647
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,748
Ah. Operative words, "used to be."

648
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:35,421
You'll find a lot of men around here
who used to be one thing or another.

649
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:39,614
When I acquire
some gainful employment...

650
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:42,048
...I am going to send for my wife
and two sons.

651
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:45,026
One of them is just about your age.

652
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:46,977
<i>Stirling Howard IV...</i>

653
00:41:47,268 --> 00:41:48,675
...where have you been?

654
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:51,230
With Will and Countee
at the hobo jungle.

655
00:41:54,498 --> 00:41:56,986
Don't you ever take him there again,
do you understand?

656
00:41:57,154 --> 00:41:58,332
Ever.

657
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,248
Yes, ma'am.

658
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,295
It wasn't his fault. Uh, uh...

659
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,361
- I was just...
- I gave them permission, Louise.

660
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:08,731
Excuse us.

661
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,002
I warned you about spending time
with those hobos.

662
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:13,311
Mom...
- A lot of them are criminals.

663
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:16,574
- Next time, you get permission from me.
- I have to go.

664
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:18,304
Come on.

665
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:24,132
Ah. I'm sorry, Mother.
- Oh, you don't have to apologize.

666
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:28,319
We just can't afford
to antagonize the boarders, that's all.

667
00:42:28,484 --> 00:42:30,142
Here, sit with me.

668
00:42:33,189 --> 00:42:35,360
I never wanted this for you.

669
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,685
Should be...

670
00:42:38,853 --> 00:42:43,905
...out playing, not worrying about boarders
and mortgages...

671
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:45,886
...and selling eggs.

672
00:42:46,054 --> 00:42:47,132
Selling what?

673
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:50,497
- Uh, eggs.
- But we don't have any chickens.

674
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,442
Yes, we do. Aunt Millie sent them.

675
00:42:53,765 --> 00:42:55,424
Kit, it will help us.

676
00:42:57,925 --> 00:42:59,332
- Oh, no.
- Kit.

677
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,054
- No.
- Kit.

678
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:04,483
Everyone knows that selling eggs
is one step away from the poorhouse.

679
00:43:04,646 --> 00:43:05,890
Margaret Mildred, sit down.

680
00:43:08,261 --> 00:43:09,374
Look at me.

681
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:12,837
Selling eggs, growing vegetables,
reusing everything we can...

682
00:43:12,997 --> 00:43:15,681
...may be the only thing
to keep us out of poorhouse.

683
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:18,978
And it's either that
or go to live with Uncle Hendrick.

684
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:21,862
Until your father finds work.

685
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:24,453
So, what'll it be?

686
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:26,652
The chickens or the uncle?

687
00:43:28,135 --> 00:43:29,859
Hmm?

688
00:43:30,343 --> 00:43:31,553
I'll take the chickens.

689
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:35,392
Thank you, thank you.

690
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,237
Thank you. Thank you.
I, Jefferson J. Berk...

691
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:41,669
...will suspend a person in midair.

692
00:43:42,376 --> 00:43:43,587
Levitation?

693
00:43:43,753 --> 00:43:46,434
Mm-hm.
No trickery, no distractions.

694
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:51,461
Right under your noses,
I will make someone in this room float.

695
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,560
Weightless.

696
00:43:56,104 --> 00:43:57,348
I need a volunteer.

697
00:43:59,944 --> 00:44:01,634
Miss Bond?

698
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:05,694
I have never levitated
a mobile librarian before.

699
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:08,062
Have you ever levitated
a dance instructor?

700
00:44:08,488 --> 00:44:10,278
Yes, but that's a long story.

701
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,065
- Come, Miss Bond.
- Oh, no.

702
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,021
Yes.
- No, Mr. Berk, I couldn't.

703
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,296
Yeah.
- Come on.

704
00:44:15,464 --> 00:44:16,675
There you go.
- Yeah.

705
00:44:16,841 --> 00:44:19,427
Miss Bond, Miss Bond, Miss Bond.

706
00:44:20,714 --> 00:44:22,600
Oh!

707
00:44:22,762 --> 00:44:25,249
- All right, but it won't work.
- Please sit down.

708
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,424
All right.
- Lean back.

709
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:32,233
All right.
- That's it, very good.

710
00:44:32,394 --> 00:44:36,070
Cross your arms over your chest.
Good. Close your eyes.

711
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:39,202
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

712
00:44:39,658 --> 00:44:41,219
- Are you comfortable?
- No.

713
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,240
Excellent. Children, the lights, please?

714
00:44:45,512 --> 00:44:47,400
Miss Dooley, would you accompany me?

715
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:48,903
I do.

716
00:44:49,065 --> 00:44:50,495
Will, yes.

717
00:45:08,714 --> 00:45:10,176
Miss Bond.

718
00:45:10,347 --> 00:45:12,769
You are getting sleepy.

719
00:45:12,938 --> 00:45:14,848
Very sleepy.

720
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,841
You're feeling as light as air.

721
00:45:17,004 --> 00:45:19,817
And you only hear my voice.
Only my voice.

722
00:45:19,979 --> 00:45:22,466
All other sounds fade away.

723
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:27,179
Your eyelids are getting heavy, very heavy.
You can barely keep them open.

724
00:45:27,947 --> 00:45:29,474
You...

725
00:45:29,772 --> 00:45:31,429
...are now...

726
00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:33,666
...asleep.

727
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,771
- Ah!
- Shh.

728
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,624
Please, Mrs. Howard,
any loud noise could awaken her...

729
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:41,314
...and she could fall.

730
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:15,148
Shh!

731
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,302
Yeah, yeah.

732
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:29,414
Miss Bond, ladies and gentlemen.

733
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:32,839
Well, I told you it wouldn't work.

734
00:47:35,696 --> 00:47:40,398
Mother, Mother, you should have seen it.
Mr. Berk just levitated Miss Bond.

735
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:43,244
Well, are you all right?

736
00:47:43,409 --> 00:47:45,798
Of course I am
because nothing happened.

737
00:47:45,969 --> 00:47:47,495
- Yes, it did.
- Oh, no.

738
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,875
- You were in the air.
- No.

739
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,382
- Is that the mail?
- Yes.

740
00:47:50,544 --> 00:47:53,861
- Uh, excuse me for a moment.
- Uh, but the mail's here, Mother.

741
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:56,138
- Mr. Berk.
- Thank you.

742
00:47:56,305 --> 00:47:57,483
- Miss Bond.
- Ooh!

743
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,984
- Is there one from Dad?
- No, sweetie, not today.

744
00:48:00,657 --> 00:48:02,544
Aw. He writes often enough.

745
00:48:02,705 --> 00:48:06,055
I must say, Mrs. K., if I marry,
when I marry...

746
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:08,648
...I hope my husband
is half as attentive as yours.

747
00:48:08,818 --> 00:48:11,633
My luck, I'll probably get some deadbeat
who never...

748
00:48:12,147 --> 00:48:14,534
Mind. Never mind.

749
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:18,022
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- Is anything wrong?

750
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:23,024
Oh, my poor cousin Frederich,
he was jumped by a hobo.

751
00:48:23,507 --> 00:48:25,710
Took his watch, his wallet...

752
00:48:25,874 --> 00:48:27,151
...and beat him pretty badly.

753
00:48:27,315 --> 00:48:28,908
- Oh.
- What a shame.

754
00:48:29,075 --> 00:48:30,504
Is his wife looking after him?

755
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:33,838
- No, he's not married.
- Oh.

756
00:48:34,002 --> 00:48:36,456
In fact, I'm the only family he has.

757
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:40,041
Mrs. Kittredge, would you mind if he came
and stayed with us for a few days?

758
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:44,171
I mean, when he gets better.
I promise, I will pay extra for his meals.

759
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,828
Of course, I have a spare cot in the attic.

760
00:48:46,995 --> 00:48:48,937
- I'll get it ready for you.
- Thank you.

761
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:51,758
Miss Bond and I were just talking
about these hobo crimes.

762
00:48:51,924 --> 00:48:55,600
Well, it's gossip, really.
You hear these things when you're mobile.

763
00:48:55,763 --> 00:49:00,106
But they say
there's been a slew of hobo robberies.

764
00:49:00,275 --> 00:49:04,531
- Well, not all hobos are alike.
- They've been ransacking people's homes...

765
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:08,009
...and mugging them in broad daylight.
Really, something should be done.

766
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,352
Well, there's talk of running them
out of town.

767
00:49:11,317 --> 00:49:13,006
They are ransacking people's homes.

768
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:15,922
I wonder if it's not a bad idea
if we don't lock up our valuables.

769
00:49:16,084 --> 00:49:18,092
I sew my money into my unmentionables.

770
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:20,628
Oh, Miss Dooley,
please, there are children here.

771
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:23,243
Don't they wear unmentionables?
I certainly hope so.

772
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:27,089
My father keeps our money
in the basement safe.

773
00:49:27,253 --> 00:49:31,277
Ha! Isn't that a kicker?
The banker who doesn't trust the bank.

774
00:49:31,443 --> 00:49:35,088
Mrs. K., would you mind keeping that
in your lockbox?

775
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:37,554
It's old and, they say, quite valuable.

776
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:39,727
Just in case.

777
00:49:40,053 --> 00:49:41,744
Of course. It's beautiful.

778
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:43,797
Uh, yes?

779
00:49:45,429 --> 00:49:47,917
Just wanna tell Ms. Kittredge
I found a place to put that coop...

780
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,671
...over in the north corner
by the, uh, clothesline there.

781
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:53,555
Excellent. Thank you, Will.
- Come on, Countee.

782
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:56,107
Good day.

783
00:49:56,277 --> 00:49:57,968
- Bye, Will. Bye, Countee.
- Bye.

784
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:00,403
I think perhaps I should lock these up
as well.

785
00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:02,955
Yes, I think I might follow suit.

786
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:06,672
I should hate to lose my father's watch.

787
00:50:09,814 --> 00:50:11,985
And these rings as well.

788
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:16,141
But that's your wedding ring.

789
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:20,336
It's okay.
It's just for safekeeping, Stirling.

790
00:50:23,191 --> 00:50:26,770
"Kindness and Honor
in the Hobo Community"?

791
00:50:27,577 --> 00:50:30,510
There's no question mark.
It's a declaration.

792
00:50:30,678 --> 00:50:33,329
"Kindness and Honor
in the Hobo Community."

793
00:50:33,493 --> 00:50:35,764
You've got to admit, it's fresh.

794
00:50:35,926 --> 00:50:37,585
Yes, but the thing is, sweetheart...

795
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,182
...you generally want people
to buy the newspaper, not laugh at it.

796
00:50:43,351 --> 00:50:45,523
There are good hobos and bad ones, sir.

797
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,733
Just like with apples.

798
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:49,646
And with...

799
00:50:50,104 --> 00:50:51,151
...editors.

800
00:50:53,111 --> 00:50:54,671
Come here, Kit.

801
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:57,263
See that map?

802
00:50:58,841 --> 00:51:02,005
Every one of those cities,
Dayton, Hamilton, Cincinnati...

803
00:51:02,169 --> 00:51:05,039
...has reported crimes
where hobos are the prime suspects.

804
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,525
They're offering $ 150
to anyone who catches the hobo criminals.

805
00:51:08,696 --> 00:51:12,887
So ask yourself, who's gonna pay a nickel
to hear what good folks hobos are?

806
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:15,662
That's exactly why
they should hear it now.

807
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:17,174
Let me give you a tip.

808
00:51:17,337 --> 00:51:20,633
Sometimes you gotta play the tune
your audience wants to sing to, Kit.

809
00:51:21,722 --> 00:51:24,144
There's been a burglary.
51 North Abbott Place.

810
00:51:24,794 --> 00:51:28,883
- Got an ID on a hobo with a limp.
- That's where Ruthie lives.

811
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:48,471
It was a hobo.
Jumped right out in front of me.

812
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:49,877
Right out in broad daylight.

813
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:51,602
- Had a limp too.
- Yes.

814
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:54,007
- Anything else?
- Did he have a tattoo?

815
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:56,211
Something unusual, like a bird, maybe?

816
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:59,991
- Okay, this is a crime scene, miss.
- Yeah, actually, he did have something.

817
00:52:00,154 --> 00:52:02,457
- Uh, bright colors.
- That's it.

818
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,007
- That's the tattoo.
- Frank?

819
00:52:05,178 --> 00:52:06,193
Over here.

820
00:52:11,964 --> 00:52:16,601
- What do you make of that, sheriff?
- That I'd say is a calling card.

821
00:52:18,747 --> 00:52:19,795
<i>Will?</i>

822
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:22,106
Will?

823
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:27,282
- Everything all right, Kit?
- Where's Will?

824
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:29,875
I don't know.
He was supposed to be here.

825
00:52:30,266 --> 00:52:31,925
Maybe he got held up.

826
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:33,171
Mail call.

827
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,675
Ah. If it was only that easy.

828
00:52:35,836 --> 00:52:40,592
Let's see, we have one for Mr. Berk.
I'll give that to him later.

829
00:52:40,988 --> 00:52:42,297
Of course, Mrs. Kittredge.

830
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,588
From Dad?

831
00:52:47,804 --> 00:52:50,193
Uh, it's from Aunt Millie.

832
00:52:50,364 --> 00:52:52,055
And, Stirling, there's one for you.

833
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:56,026
Mother.

834
00:52:56,189 --> 00:52:57,564
It's from New York.

835
00:52:58,077 --> 00:52:59,321
From Dad.

836
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:07,028
And there's one in here for you too.

837
00:53:16,445 --> 00:53:17,973
Forty dollars?

838
00:53:20,415 --> 00:53:22,202
Um...

839
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,885
Excuse me.

840
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,568
There you are.

841
00:53:44,735 --> 00:53:45,946
What are you doing up here?

842
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,597
- Sorry, I was just...
- No, no, it's fine.

843
00:53:48,766 --> 00:53:51,134
I'm just changing the sheets.

844
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,731
I was looking for you earlier.
I forgot to ask you about the letter.

845
00:53:56,896 --> 00:53:59,895
Does your father say
when he's coming back to Cincinnati?

846
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,115
Stirling?

847
00:54:10,463 --> 00:54:11,575
Oh, no.

848
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:14,716
He wants you to move to New York,
doesn't he?

849
00:54:17,218 --> 00:54:19,998
That's it. That's why you're so upset.

850
00:54:21,663 --> 00:54:23,802
Your father found a job in New York...

851
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:26,204
...and now he wants you to move
with him.

852
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:29,983
Why can't people find jobs in Cincinnati?

853
00:54:31,361 --> 00:54:33,433
I hate the mailman.

854
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,127
And mailing...

855
00:54:35,297 --> 00:54:37,271
...letters and words. I hate words.

856
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,855
- What are you talking about?
- Because you believe them.

857
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:43,165
Even when they're not true.

858
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:51,033
He said he'd write.
He said, "You'll hear from me."

859
00:54:51,842 --> 00:54:53,565
Your father?

860
00:54:53,762 --> 00:54:55,550
I made him promise.

861
00:54:55,905 --> 00:54:57,367
You did?

862
00:54:57,824 --> 00:54:59,516
He kept his word at first.

863
00:55:00,353 --> 00:55:02,557
I got a letter every week.

864
00:55:04,098 --> 00:55:06,619
Then they got fewer and fewer...

865
00:55:06,787 --> 00:55:09,306
...until one day, they just stopped.

866
00:55:11,906 --> 00:55:13,815
And then she took her ring off.

867
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:20,921
You wrote that letter to your mother?

868
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:25,215
She just needs to hear from him.

869
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:29,086
But there was money inside.

870
00:55:32,899 --> 00:55:35,583
He gave it to me before he left.

871
00:55:37,314 --> 00:55:39,289
For an emergency.

872
00:55:42,147 --> 00:55:44,864
I think I always sort of knew.

873
00:55:48,004 --> 00:55:50,459
He's never coming back to us.

874
00:56:49,287 --> 00:56:50,847
Hi, Kit.

875
00:56:52,134 --> 00:56:54,337
I got something for you.

876
00:57:02,982 --> 00:57:04,608
It's a scooter.

877
00:57:05,894 --> 00:57:06,876
Thank you.

878
00:57:07,848 --> 00:57:10,270
Will, what happened to your leg?

879
00:57:10,439 --> 00:57:11,683
I hurt it the other night.

880
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:14,781
Are you sure it didn't happen
yesterday morning?

881
00:57:18,151 --> 00:57:20,540
Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions, son?

882
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,139
No, sir.

883
00:57:25,128 --> 00:57:28,062
How exactly did you hurt your leg?

884
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:30,398
I was jumped.

885
00:57:31,016 --> 00:57:32,738
Is that so?

886
00:57:33,543 --> 00:57:34,885
Yes, sir.

887
00:57:35,047 --> 00:57:36,771
It was the other night.

888
00:57:36,935 --> 00:57:38,845
Someone jumped me
and kicked me in the knee.

889
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:42,498
Are those the boots you were wearing?

890
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,865
- No, he took my boots.
- Now, isn't that a shame?

891
00:57:49,193 --> 00:57:52,454
Now, if we wanted to identify a footprint,
we'd be hard-pressed.

892
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,095
Did you remember to report it?

893
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:01,123
- Being a hobo, sir, who's gonna listen?
- Hmm.

894
00:58:01,897 --> 00:58:03,304
Do you know the Smithens?

895
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,040
Ruthie Smithens?

896
00:58:08,426 --> 00:58:13,213
All these people seem to think
you know quite a bit about her.

897
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:17,059
- About her financial situation.
- No. I don't know.

898
00:58:17,225 --> 00:58:20,128
Did you or did you not know
the Smithens were out of town?

899
00:58:22,698 --> 00:58:24,584
I knew they were gone, yes, sir.

900
00:58:24,745 --> 00:58:26,339
Do you remember her telling you...

901
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:29,254
...they kept their money
in a safe in the basement?

902
00:58:30,762 --> 00:58:33,828
I'm gonna have to ask you
to remain local, son.

903
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:37,314
You flip a train
in the middle of the night...

904
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:40,384
...or you step one toe
outside the city limits...

905
00:58:40,554 --> 00:58:43,173
...I will track you down
and lock you up so fast...

906
00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:45,991
...you'll put those boots
right back on your feet.

907
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,813
You understand me?

908
00:58:51,435 --> 00:58:52,449
Stop! Thief!

909
00:58:53,259 --> 00:58:57,221
- Hey, you! Stop!
- Hello?

910
00:58:57,516 --> 00:58:59,337
Mother? Are you there?

911
00:58:59,499 --> 00:59:01,060
Kit? Stirling?
- Who's there?

912
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:04,228
- What's going on?
- We've been robbed!

913
00:59:04,396 --> 00:59:06,535
One more time, Mr. Berk.

914
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:08,233
I couldn't sleep.

915
00:59:08,394 --> 00:59:12,104
- I heard a noise, I thought, outside.
- So did I.

916
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:15,618
So I went to check,
and that was when I saw him.

917
00:59:15,788 --> 00:59:16,933
Will Shepherd?

918
00:59:17,323 --> 00:59:18,338
It was dark.

919
00:59:19,116 --> 00:59:22,149
It was Will.
And he was carrying the lockbox.

920
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:26,474
Ms. Kittredge, any of your belongings
in that lockbox?

921
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:28,355
Um...

922
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:30,629
...every penny we had
was in that lockbox.

923
00:59:31,148 --> 00:59:33,865
- He took your money?
- Of course he took their money.

924
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,068
Knowing they needed it for the mortgage?

925
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:39,332
- Let's pick him up, Frank.
- No.

926
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,332
What a horrible boy.

927
00:59:44,621 --> 00:59:47,042
He talked a lot about Robin Hood, Kit.

928
00:59:47,213 --> 00:59:48,871
About stealing from the rich.

929
00:59:49,037 --> 00:59:52,299
But we're not rich, and he knows that.

930
00:59:52,461 --> 00:59:54,698
I don't believe it. I just don't believe it.

931
00:59:55,437 --> 00:59:59,300
Will Shepherd?
Has anyone seen Will Shepherd?

932
00:59:59,981 --> 01:00:01,738
Will Shepherd?

933
01:00:13,294 --> 01:00:15,661
I'm sorry to bother you so early, ma'am.

934
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:18,949
No, it's fine. Come in, please.

935
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,313
- Morning.
- Morning.

936
01:00:31,054 --> 01:00:34,218
My deputy found these
in Will Shepherd's tent early this morning.

937
01:00:34,511 --> 01:00:36,650
We were hoping you could ID them for us,
ma'am.

938
01:00:38,543 --> 01:00:41,032
Are these the boots
you gave to Will Shepherd?

939
01:00:47,887 --> 01:00:49,164
And this?

940
01:00:49,615 --> 01:00:52,267
Oh, that's my brooch. Yes.

941
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:56,077
Did...? Did you happen
to see my mother's ring?

942
01:00:56,655 --> 01:00:57,866
No, son.

943
01:00:58,032 --> 01:01:00,072
We figured he started
at the Smithens' house...

944
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:02,761
...then moved on to yours.
It's an inside job, all right.

945
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:04,171
No, it's impossible.

946
01:01:04,432 --> 01:01:06,852
The man who robbed the Smithens' house
had a tattoo.

947
01:01:07,022 --> 01:01:10,187
I heard it from an eyewitness.
I have notes.

948
01:01:10,351 --> 01:01:13,450
- Will doesn't have a tattoo, sheriff.
- Sweetheart.

949
01:01:13,617 --> 01:01:15,177
Have you found him yet?

950
01:01:16,175 --> 01:01:18,085
Nobody's seen him.

951
01:01:18,256 --> 01:01:20,940
Nobody seems to know where he is.

952
01:01:22,864 --> 01:01:24,653
<i>Dear Dad, it's been weeks...</i>

953
01:01:24,816 --> 01:01:27,206
<i>... and there's still no sign</i>
<i>of Will or Countee.</i>

954
01:01:27,377 --> 01:01:29,318
<i>I just don't believe he'd rob us, Dad.</i>

955
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:31,660
<i>But someone did,</i>
<i>and now our money's all gone.</i>

956
01:01:31,824 --> 01:01:35,981
<i>Now there's a foreclosure sign in the middle</i>
<i>of our beautiful, beautiful lawn.</i>

957
01:01:36,145 --> 01:01:39,691
<i>If that's not bad enough, Uncle Hendrick</i>
<i>said we can't bring Grace with us...</i>

958
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:42,922
<i>... when we go to live with him.</i>
<i>We have to give her away, Dad.</i>

959
01:01:43,088 --> 01:01:45,227
<i>How can I give her away?</i>

960
01:01:45,393 --> 01:01:48,972
<i>I wanna ask Mother to talk to him again.</i>
<i>She's so sad, Dad.</i>

961
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,309
<i>She hardly ever smiles.</i>

962
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,903
<i>Dad, why aren't you here?</i>

963
01:01:53,073 --> 01:01:56,173
<i>Why haven't we heard from you?</i>
<i>You promised you'd write every week...</i>

964
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,339
<i>... and now it just keeps getting</i>
<i>longer and longer between letters.</i>

965
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,000
<i>You can't disappear.</i>

966
01:02:01,169 --> 01:02:03,722
<i>If you're not working in Chicago,</i>
<i>why can't you not work in Cin...?</i>

967
01:02:34,388 --> 01:02:37,616
<i>Dear Dad, I got a letter</i>
<i>from Frances and Florence yesterday.</i>

968
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:41,128
<i>They're settled with family</i>
<i>in Sacramento, California, doing great...</i>

969
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,022
<i>... just like you said.</i>

970
01:02:43,187 --> 01:02:45,839
<i>Did Mother mention</i>
<i>that Ruthie's father spoke to the bank?</i>

971
01:02:46,004 --> 01:02:48,654
<i>And they're giving us an extra month</i>
<i>to stay in the house?</i>

972
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:51,984
<i>I know that Ruthie pushed for us.</i>
<i>She's such a true friend.</i>

973
01:02:52,628 --> 01:02:55,945
<i>Last week, Mother made a dress for me</i>
<i>out of a chicken-feed sack.</i>

974
01:02:56,117 --> 01:02:58,417
<i>I wore it on the first day of school.</i>
<i>I didn't mind a bit.</i>

975
01:02:58,579 --> 01:02:59,659
It's so beautiful.

976
01:02:59,828 --> 01:03:02,610
<i>In fact, a few of the girls</i>
<i>thought it looked so smart...</i>

977
01:03:02,771 --> 01:03:05,587
<i>... she made some for them too.</i>
<i>For money.</i>

978
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:06,958
<i>Imagine that.</i>

979
01:03:07,124 --> 01:03:09,426
<i>All that feed-sack material</i>
<i>was being thrown away.</i>

980
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:10,931
<i>That's pure profit.</i>

981
01:03:11,093 --> 01:03:15,151
<i>Aunt Millie will be so proud,</i>
<i>and Uncle Hendrick will be horrified.</i>

982
01:03:15,316 --> 01:03:18,251
<i>I think I'll wear it the first day</i>
<i>we move in with him.</i>

983
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:21,901
I know your legs are short,
but you can do it.

984
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:23,476
Yes, good girl, good girl.

985
01:03:23,637 --> 01:03:27,216
<i>And selling eggs isn't as bad</i>
<i>as I thought. In fact, it's kind of fun.</i>

986
01:03:27,478 --> 01:03:31,952
Eggs! Get your eggs!
Fresh eggs. Fifteen cents a dozen.

987
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:34,356
Get your eggs. Fresh eggs.

988
01:03:34,517 --> 01:03:37,900
<i>Mr. Berk went to pick up his cousin</i>
<i>Frederich from the train station.</i>

989
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:40,458
<i>I think a new face in the house</i>
<i>will cheer us all up.</i>

990
01:03:40,629 --> 01:03:42,452
<i>And wherever Will and Countee</i>
<i>are, I only hope...</i>

991
01:03:49,878 --> 01:03:51,788
Is he wearing the diaper?

992
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:53,999
Yes, Jefferson.

993
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:56,306
A monkey?

994
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:03,602
His name's Curtis. Hmm. Heh.

995
01:04:05,527 --> 01:04:10,000
I love you, Curtis.
Who's my little monkey boy?

996
01:04:19,448 --> 01:04:21,203
He's so cute.

997
01:04:24,631 --> 01:04:28,560
Stirling, get away
from that hideous creature now.

998
01:04:28,727 --> 01:04:30,069
Oh, oh, oh!

999
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,087
Get it off. Get it off. Off, off, off!

1000
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:37,678
Curtis, come.

1001
01:04:39,095 --> 01:04:40,438
Scratch his little tummy...

1002
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,833
...and he'll be your friend forever,
won't you?

1003
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:44,951
If I scratch his...

1004
01:04:45,336 --> 01:04:46,384
Margaret.

1005
01:04:46,745 --> 01:04:50,062
It's a good thing we're moving
because otherwise, we'd move.

1006
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:56,816
Uh, Mr. Berk, there's a cot
ready for you upstairs now.

1007
01:04:56,983 --> 01:05:00,115
I'm sorry for the mess.
It's such a large house to pack up.

1008
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,808
There's no time to do it.

1009
01:05:01,977 --> 01:05:05,458
Thanks for your trouble,
ma'am. I'm only staying a few days.

1010
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:08,756
- Are you from Baltimore too, Mr. Berk?
- Call me Frederich.

1011
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:12,758
Originally, I'm from Canada.
- What a coincidence.

1012
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:16,086
- I thought you were from Poughkeepsie.
- Shh!

1013
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:19,959
Uh, but I moved to Baltimore in '22
to work with Jeff in the magic show.

1014
01:05:20,121 --> 01:05:23,635
We called ourselves Luigi and Sam.

1015
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,009
I was Luigi.

1016
01:05:26,394 --> 01:05:28,947
Yeah. Good times.

1017
01:05:29,114 --> 01:05:30,358
Anyway.

1018
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:33,140
Jeff would saw a woman in half
while Lola sang.

1019
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:36,280
- Lola?
- Yeah.

1020
01:05:37,338 --> 01:05:40,884
Lola. This was her favorite spot.

1021
01:05:41,116 --> 01:05:43,537
May she rest in peace.

1022
01:05:44,218 --> 01:05:46,837
The sheriff said it was an inside job.

1023
01:05:47,003 --> 01:05:49,393
So Mr. Berk knew
where Mother kept the jewels and money.

1024
01:05:49,564 --> 01:05:53,424
But how did Mr. Berk get the brooch
out of the lockbox and into Will's tent?

1025
01:05:53,594 --> 01:05:57,850
What if he never put the brooch
in the box?

1026
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,432
That's it. A sleight of hand.

1027
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:03,669
<i>Remember when Mr. Berk</i>
<i>put his watch in the jewelry bag?</i>

1028
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,966
<i>He must taken the brooch out,</i>
<i>put it in his pocket...</i>

1029
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:08,757
- And given it to...
- Frederich.

1030
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:10,745
He must have stolen Will's boots.

1031
01:06:10,907 --> 01:06:14,683
Right. And that means that Frederich
must have gone to Will's camp...

1032
01:06:14,843 --> 01:06:18,487
...dressed as a hobo
and hid the boots and jewelry in Will's tent.

1033
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,264
All Mr. Berk needed to do
was to make the sheriff suspect Will.

1034
01:06:22,908 --> 01:06:24,283
The limp.

1035
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:27,413
Will said someone kicked him
in the knee.

1036
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:31,125
They made him limp
and then committed a crime...

1037
01:06:31,292 --> 01:06:33,397
...where a limping hobo
could be identified.

1038
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:37,526
- At my house.
- That's why he did it in broad daylight.

1039
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,481
<i>He left the boot print in the mud...</i>

1040
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,065
<i>... and wanted someone to see him</i>
<i>limp away.</i>

1041
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:45,336
What's going on over there?

1042
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,850
We figured it out, Kit.
But now we have to go to the police.

1043
01:06:50,012 --> 01:06:51,091
No, not without proof.

1044
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,427
Do you know where?
- Of course.

1045
01:06:54,589 --> 01:06:55,603
I certainly hope so.

1046
01:06:57,149 --> 01:06:58,164
Perfect.

1047
01:06:58,334 --> 01:07:00,822
Let's go look in their room for the money.

1048
01:07:05,854 --> 01:07:07,797
If anyone comes back, blow this whistle.

1049
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:09,496
Are you sure about this?

1050
01:07:09,661 --> 01:07:12,051
Look, how often is the house
completely empty?

1051
01:07:12,222 --> 01:07:15,069
Everyone's gone. It's now or never.

1052
01:07:18,943 --> 01:07:20,372
Come on.

1053
01:07:28,734 --> 01:07:30,710
- Ruthie, keep watch.
- Okay.

1054
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:42,522
We need to find our money.
Where is it? It's all the money we have.

1055
01:07:43,553 --> 01:07:44,698
In mystery novels...

1056
01:07:44,864 --> 01:07:47,416
...there's usually a button
on the side of these trunks...

1057
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,469
...that opens a secret compartment.

1058
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:52,445
Where is it? Where's that button?

1059
01:07:56,607 --> 01:07:57,785
Ruthie, I found it.

1060
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:02,905
This is the red wallet.

1061
01:08:04,704 --> 01:08:07,038
Thought you said you had a map.
- I do.

1062
01:08:07,232 --> 01:08:08,508
I have one.

1063
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:11,159
- I just don't remember where exactly.
- Oh, that's great.

1064
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:14,678
- You need a map to find the map, right?
- I've got a map, Jeff.

1065
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:19,611
Ruthie, your mother's necklace.

1066
01:08:19,777 --> 01:08:21,436
But where's the lockbox?

1067
01:08:24,192 --> 01:08:26,080
Look at this.

1068
01:08:26,592 --> 01:08:30,041
Dayton. Cincinnati. Hamilton.

1069
01:08:32,898 --> 01:08:34,489
Sarnia? No.

1070
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:37,115
Columbus.

1071
01:08:37,506 --> 01:08:40,353
Cleveland. Ruthie, do you know
what this means?

1072
01:08:40,674 --> 01:08:42,103
Yes.

1073
01:08:42,274 --> 01:08:43,932
- No.
- Mr. Berk's cousin...

1074
01:08:44,098 --> 01:08:46,682
...has been in every city
where the hobo crimes happened.

1075
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,176
Holy cow.

1076
01:08:50,465 --> 01:08:52,538
Oh, my gosh. Where'd this come from?

1077
01:08:52,706 --> 01:08:53,753
Stirling.

1078
01:08:54,209 --> 01:08:57,058
The hobo sign for danger.

1079
01:09:01,634 --> 01:09:03,195
Shh!

1080
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:09,057
Make him stop that squealing.
Put him in that thing.

1081
01:09:10,882 --> 01:09:15,487
- He doesn't react well to tension.
- Neither do I. You don't hear me screaming!

1082
01:09:15,747 --> 01:09:18,236
All right, just give me the map.
Come on, let's go.

1083
01:09:19,204 --> 01:09:21,025
What are you doing?

1084
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,785
There is no map.

1085
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:29,884
Right? You buried the loot, but you have
no idea exactly where you buried it.

1086
01:09:30,052 --> 01:09:32,506
Let me think, all right?

1087
01:09:32,675 --> 01:09:35,610
- Just let me think.
- Yeah, well, that'll take forever.

1088
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:40,385
I put it somewhere I knew I wouldn't forget,
somewhere I was sure to find it.

1089
01:09:46,947 --> 01:09:50,013
You see?
I'm not the numbskull you think I am.

1090
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:53,180
Okay, great. Let's just get going, okay?
Come on.

1091
01:09:53,668 --> 01:09:55,707
Hey, what's this doing open?

1092
01:09:55,876 --> 01:09:57,534
Is everything still there?

1093
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,238
- Where is it?
- Shh.

1094
01:10:06,597 --> 01:10:09,564
You probably just left it open by accident.
Come on, let's go.

1095
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,596
Then what's this rock doing here?

1096
01:10:13,957 --> 01:10:16,446
It probably came from the out-of-doors.

1097
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:21,410
It's got Hobo writing on it, Jefferson.
It means danger.

1098
01:10:21,861 --> 01:10:23,323
I don't like it.

1099
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:25,473
Not one little bit.

1100
01:10:26,982 --> 01:10:29,087
All right, help me with this trunk.

1101
01:10:29,254 --> 01:10:32,101
- Where are we going with my trunk?
- No, we are not going anywhere.

1102
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:33,669
That would just raise suspicion.

1103
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,871
You are gonna tell me exactly
where the loot is buried.

1104
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:38,079
Then you're on a 4:00 train to Baltimore.

1105
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:41,114
Bal...? By...? By myself?

1106
01:10:41,413 --> 01:10:43,039
I hate traveling alone.

1107
01:10:43,877 --> 01:10:48,668
Frederich, if your instinct is right,
and I highly, highly doubt it...

1108
01:10:49,318 --> 01:10:53,246
...I don't want to have any nosy boarders
or ambitious little sheriffs sniffing around.

1109
01:10:53,414 --> 01:10:55,170
It's too risky. Do you understand me?

1110
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,375
- So let's go.
- What about Curtis?

1111
01:10:58,536 --> 01:11:00,739
I promise I'll bring him to you
next week, okay?

1112
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:04,896
- You won't forget he likes raisins?
- Can we just go, please?!

1113
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:08,005
Come on.

1114
01:11:10,151 --> 01:11:11,297
Wait, my coat.

1115
01:11:14,056 --> 01:11:15,714
It's right there on the chair.

1116
01:11:16,808 --> 01:11:18,214
Come on.

1117
01:11:20,935 --> 01:11:23,653
Come on, you have everything now?
- Yeah.

1118
01:11:34,218 --> 01:11:36,323
It's okay. It's okay.

1119
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:40,318
Shh! Good monkey. I'm getting in that car.

1120
01:11:40,487 --> 01:11:41,763
What? Where are you going?

1121
01:11:41,928 --> 01:11:44,612
- It's too dangerous. Stop.
- I need to get our money back.

1122
01:11:44,776 --> 01:11:47,165
It's the only chance
we have to keep our home.

1123
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:55,875
Kit, no.

1124
01:11:56,234 --> 01:11:57,661
Kit.

1125
01:12:01,929 --> 01:12:04,034
Oh, my gosh. Kit, what are you doing?

1126
01:12:09,257 --> 01:12:12,258
Stirling. Stirling, wake up. Are you okay?

1127
01:12:12,427 --> 01:12:13,986
Yeah.

1128
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:16,806
You and Ruthie get the police.
I'm going with them.

1129
01:12:17,193 --> 01:12:18,622
What?

1130
01:12:34,763 --> 01:12:38,056
Don't see why I gotta go.
- Because you have to.

1131
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:40,833
Curtis.
You can't take a monkey on a train.

1132
01:12:48,843 --> 01:12:50,370
I love you too, Curtis.

1133
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:52,837
Get in the car.

1134
01:12:54,923 --> 01:12:57,606
You know where everything is, right?
- Yeah, I know.

1135
01:12:57,771 --> 01:12:58,884
- Yeah, I know.
- Do you?

1136
01:12:59,052 --> 01:13:00,710
Then where am I going?
Which way do I turn?

1137
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:02,762
Left here.
- Thanks for telling me.

1138
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:04,581
- That's nice.
- Stop yelling at me!

1139
01:13:04,748 --> 01:13:08,578
I'm not. I'm trying to get information.
- I won't show you where.

1140
01:13:08,749 --> 01:13:12,131
I know where it is, not you.
Who's smart now, Mr. Mustache-Bald-Head?

1141
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,924
Moron!

1142
01:13:20,748 --> 01:13:22,210
Miss Bond.
- Miss Bond.

1143
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,195
What?
- Miss Bond. Stirling, come on.

1144
01:13:25,356 --> 01:13:27,593
- Miss Bond, we need you.
- Miss Bond. Miss Bond.

1145
01:13:27,756 --> 01:13:29,829
We really need you.
- What?

1146
01:13:29,997 --> 01:13:31,175
Really.

1147
01:13:31,342 --> 01:13:33,413
We found out
that the Berks stole the money.

1148
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,816
And Kit got in the back of the car.

1149
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:38,468
And they said something
about a train station.

1150
01:13:38,636 --> 01:13:40,546
Get in the car. Get in the car.

1151
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:42,757
I'm going.
- I'll call the police.

1152
01:13:51,757 --> 01:13:54,123
Whoa!

1153
01:13:57,005 --> 01:14:00,486
Whoa!
- Are you all right back there?

1154
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:05,127
Kit should never have gone with them.

1155
01:14:05,295 --> 01:14:08,611
- What train were they catching?
- The 4:00 to Baltimore.

1156
01:14:08,783 --> 01:14:12,263
It sounded like the money was buried
in the woods next to the train station.

1157
01:14:12,429 --> 01:14:14,339
Interesting.

1158
01:14:14,862 --> 01:14:17,830
Well, we've got to get there
before they find Kit.

1159
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:19,460
Okay, hang on!

1160
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,489
Whoa, nelly!

1161
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:36,099
Eight, nine, 10.

1162
01:14:38,094 --> 01:14:39,720
All right, we dig.

1163
01:14:39,887 --> 01:14:41,775
What do you mean "we"?

1164
01:14:45,167 --> 01:14:49,062
Three, two, one.

1165
01:14:50,127 --> 01:14:51,653
I got it now.

1166
01:14:52,015 --> 01:14:53,707
Seven.

1167
01:14:55,278 --> 01:14:57,134
Now, this is it.

1168
01:14:58,735 --> 01:15:00,263
Ow!

1169
01:15:02,032 --> 01:15:03,462
Alrighty.

1170
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:06,666
Oh, Miss Bond.

1171
01:15:14,224 --> 01:15:16,232
- Miss Bond, no.
- Shh.

1172
01:15:16,401 --> 01:15:19,019
Now, don't you worry.
Everything's gonna be just fine.

1173
01:15:19,185 --> 01:15:20,526
That's Mr. Berk's car.

1174
01:15:20,688 --> 01:15:23,023
I've called the police.
They'll be here any minute.

1175
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:26,220
Now, stay put, all right?

1176
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:41,414
- Come on, Ruthie. Let's follow.
- But she said to stay put.

1177
01:15:41,585 --> 01:15:43,015
Come on, hurry.

1178
01:15:54,034 --> 01:15:55,082
There she is.

1179
01:15:55,249 --> 01:15:57,389
- Kit.
- What are you doing here?

1180
01:15:57,746 --> 01:16:00,300
- Did anyone see you?
- No. Miss Bond brought us.

1181
01:16:00,467 --> 01:16:02,255
She's gonna help us. Look.

1182
01:16:02,772 --> 01:16:04,233
Is that it?

1183
01:16:05,235 --> 01:16:07,056
Easy, easy.

1184
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:14,760
- That's it. That's it.
- Shovel.

1185
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,528
Come on.

1186
01:16:21,492 --> 01:16:23,085
Yes.

1187
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,800
- They found the box.
- This isn't fair.

1188
01:16:25,971 --> 01:16:29,615
That's our box. That's our money.
That's all that we have.

1189
01:16:29,778 --> 01:16:31,918
We'll get it back to you, Kit.
Don't worry.

1190
01:16:32,082 --> 01:16:34,090
- Kit was in your car.
- They're blaming Will.

1191
01:16:34,259 --> 01:16:37,871
Miss Bond called the police.
They're on their way.

1192
01:16:38,611 --> 01:16:43,216
- Wait, where did Miss Bond call from?
- Your house, why?

1193
01:16:45,235 --> 01:16:48,203
Our phone doesn't work, Stirling.

1194
01:16:48,372 --> 01:16:50,859
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1195
01:16:51,124 --> 01:16:52,718
Miss Bond.

1196
01:16:52,884 --> 01:16:55,503
Miss Bond was in on it all along.

1197
01:16:57,941 --> 01:16:59,883
How could I have not have seen it?

1198
01:17:00,053 --> 01:17:02,322
Of course,
every magician has an accomplice.

1199
01:17:02,485 --> 01:17:05,713
- What are you talking about, woman?
- You can't really levitate someone.

1200
01:17:05,877 --> 01:17:08,747
- Unless they're in on the trick.
- Exactly.

1201
01:17:09,301 --> 01:17:11,025
What do we do now?

1202
01:17:12,343 --> 01:17:15,156
- turn around and go back right this...

1203
01:17:17,334 --> 01:17:18,381
Magic.

1204
01:17:19,574 --> 01:17:22,259
Yoo-hoo! Over here.

1205
01:17:22,423 --> 01:17:23,828
She's got a camera.

1206
01:17:24,852 --> 01:17:26,543
Kit!

1207
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:35,859
Yoo-hoo! Over here.

1208
01:17:36,598 --> 01:17:38,059
Ooh! Ooh!

1209
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:41,584
No.

1210
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:43,659
Get up. No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1211
01:17:43,989 --> 01:17:46,543
He's taking the loot. Get him.

1212
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:04,273
Get him. Get him.

1213
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:07,953
It's all right, Stirling.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1214
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,836
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1215
01:18:22,102 --> 01:18:24,306
Look, the hobo jungle. We can hide there.

1216
01:18:25,912 --> 01:18:27,504
I've got an idea.

1217
01:18:31,577 --> 01:18:32,689
What are you doing?

1218
01:18:33,368 --> 01:18:35,735
Giving us a head start.

1219
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:48,754
Oh, just let the Kittredges keep their money.

1220
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,376
- Oh, stop it.
- It was never part of our plan.

1221
01:18:51,545 --> 01:18:55,736
Okay, there was $250 in there.
I am not letting them keep nothing.

1222
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,904
You tell your girlfriend to button it.

1223
01:18:58,073 --> 01:19:00,047
Quiet.
- Girlfriend?

1224
01:19:00,217 --> 01:19:03,316
Oh, don't be so naive, Lucinda.
This is the way it's gonna be from now on.

1225
01:19:05,018 --> 01:19:06,098
Oh, lovebirds.

1226
01:19:07,802 --> 01:19:10,453
It's a good thing I read Hobo.

1227
01:19:11,674 --> 01:19:13,268
This way.

1228
01:19:14,779 --> 01:19:16,689
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1229
01:19:29,658 --> 01:19:30,869
Okay, I think we're close.

1230
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:34,864
Kit?
- Will.

1231
01:19:35,035 --> 01:19:37,402
- What are you all doing?
- They're chasing us.

1232
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:39,734
We know who did it.
The Berks and Miss Bond.

1233
01:19:39,898 --> 01:19:41,622
- Berks?
- I always knew it wasn't you.

1234
01:19:41,787 --> 01:19:43,347
- They're after us.
- They set you up.

1235
01:19:43,514 --> 01:19:44,628
Come on, let's go.

1236
01:19:50,459 --> 01:19:52,052
- Oh, yeah, that's great.
- Oh!

1237
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,781
Great, huh?

1238
01:19:54,076 --> 01:19:56,563
Boy, sure is a good thing you read Hobo.

1239
01:19:58,011 --> 01:20:01,307
Come on, let's go.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1240
01:20:15,006 --> 01:20:17,044
Hi. Ahem. Excuse me.

1241
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:19,034
I was wondering
if somebody could help us.

1242
01:20:19,196 --> 01:20:21,433
Uh, we just happened
to be picnicking nearby...

1243
01:20:21,595 --> 01:20:24,913
...and, uh, it seems that
we have lost our children.

1244
01:20:25,084 --> 01:20:26,393
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1245
01:20:26,556 --> 01:20:29,818
Yes. So, naturally, we thought
that they had wandered over here.

1246
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:33,144
Oh, naturally, naturally.
Has anyone seen any lost children?

1247
01:20:33,308 --> 01:20:35,197
Mm-mm.

1248
01:20:37,949 --> 01:20:39,291
No.

1249
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:43,124
Well, I, uh... I have, um...

1250
01:20:43,709 --> 01:20:45,084
Let's see. Uh...

1251
01:20:45,245 --> 01:20:47,963
Fifty, 70, 80.

1252
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,583
A hundred, uh, dollars...

1253
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:55,222
...that, uh, I'm sure would probably buy
a lot of food for that baby...

1254
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:58,357
...and, uh, be able to give some of you
a fresh start.

1255
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:00,217
So that you might once again become...

1256
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:03,257
...respectable members
of the community again.

1257
01:21:03,421 --> 01:21:05,494
Ah. Respectable members
of the community?

1258
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:08,339
- Yes.
- Like you?

1259
01:21:10,431 --> 01:21:11,675
- Achoo!
- Shh!

1260
01:21:18,878 --> 01:21:22,108
Hello, my little angels. Get them.

1261
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,268
Help! Help!

1262
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:28,797
Help! That's my money! Give it back!

1263
01:21:28,959 --> 01:21:31,031
Not so fast.

1264
01:21:32,351 --> 01:21:33,430
Let go of me.

1265
01:21:34,527 --> 01:21:36,916
Aah! No!

1266
01:21:40,415 --> 01:21:42,074
Thank you, ma'am.

1267
01:21:42,816 --> 01:21:46,012
- Anytime.
- Lucinda.

1268
01:21:46,465 --> 01:21:48,026
The magic is gone.

1269
01:21:52,256 --> 01:21:54,110
No. No.

1270
01:21:54,272 --> 01:21:56,923
No. Unh! Ow.

1271
01:21:58,465 --> 01:22:03,450
Forgive me, Kit.
All of you, I'm so sorry.

1272
01:22:03,616 --> 01:22:05,438
Somehow we convinced ourselves...

1273
01:22:05,601 --> 01:22:09,912
...that desperate times
justify desperate measures.

1274
01:22:10,081 --> 01:22:12,861
Well, Jefferson, I was being naive.

1275
01:22:13,984 --> 01:22:19,070
There we were gallivanting
across the country like Robin Hood...

1276
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:22,048
...stealing from the rich
to give to the poor.

1277
01:22:22,497 --> 01:22:23,958
When technically...

1278
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:30,360
...all we really did was steal from the rich
and the poor and kept it.

1279
01:22:32,577 --> 01:22:34,585
Really, that's what we did.

1280
01:22:34,977 --> 01:22:36,732
And you...

1281
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:40,666
...Jefferson Jasper Renee Berk...

1282
01:22:40,834 --> 01:22:43,006
- Ha, ha!
- Renee?

1283
01:22:44,515 --> 01:22:46,206
- are no Robin Hood.

1284
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:51,807
Mac, why don't we go to town,
tell the sheriff we solved the crime spree?

1285
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:53,629
Tell him it wasn't a hobo after all.

1286
01:22:53,795 --> 01:22:55,682
Yeah. That's right.

1287
01:22:56,322 --> 01:22:58,014
Hey, come on. Easy.

1288
01:22:58,754 --> 01:23:01,472
Goodbye, my friends.
- Bye, Miss Bond.

1289
01:23:02,883 --> 01:23:04,344
Where's Countee, Will?

1290
01:23:04,964 --> 01:23:08,347
You know how they say if you wanna
hide something, you do it in plain sight?

1291
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:11,002
- Uh-uh.
- Yeah. No.

1292
01:23:12,226 --> 01:23:13,851
Hey, Countee.

1293
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:25,499
You dressed him as a girl?
- I am a girl.

1294
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,873
He's a she? You're a her?

1295
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:32,446
Everyone,
meet Constance Angel Eudora Garvey.

1296
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,787
Sorry we had to fool you all...

1297
01:23:34,948 --> 01:23:37,666
...but, uh, I promised her daddy
I'd look out for her.

1298
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:40,961
- It's dangerous for girls to ride the rails.
- Are you mad?

1299
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:43,907
Of course we're not.
And I like your dress.

1300
01:23:44,612 --> 01:23:47,711
- Thank you.
- Do I have to call you Constance?

1301
01:23:48,004 --> 01:23:48,986
No.

1302
01:23:50,085 --> 01:23:51,329
Good.

1303
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:54,523
You may be a girl,
but you'll always be a boy to me, Countee.

1304
01:23:54,694 --> 01:23:56,995
Thanks, I think.

1305
01:24:01,222 --> 01:24:02,531
Yeah.

1306
01:24:36,358 --> 01:24:37,700
That looks good.

1307
01:24:37,862 --> 01:24:41,060
How exquisite.
- Lovely, Margaret.

1308
01:24:41,511 --> 01:24:44,031
Well, we certainly have a lot
to be thankful for.

1309
01:24:45,031 --> 01:24:47,070
Hear, hear. To Kit.

1310
01:24:47,238 --> 01:24:50,087
We certainly wouldn't still be here
without you.

1311
01:24:51,496 --> 01:24:53,089
To Kit.

1312
01:24:53,512 --> 01:24:55,038
Your father would be so proud.

1313
01:24:57,032 --> 01:24:59,879
And what do you hear from Chicago,
Margaret?

1314
01:25:08,038 --> 01:25:10,340
Kit, would you please pass the beans
to Miss Dooley?

1315
01:25:10,502 --> 01:25:11,779
Yes.

1316
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,836
Kit.
- Will? Countee?

1317
01:25:29,544 --> 01:25:30,527
Ma'am.

1318
01:25:31,496 --> 01:25:33,219
Sorry to disturb you all...

1319
01:25:33,385 --> 01:25:36,734
...but this being Thanksgiving,
we just wanted to show our thanks.

1320
01:25:36,905 --> 01:25:38,662
It won't be but a minute.

1321
01:25:38,825 --> 01:25:40,385
Come on in.

1322
01:25:40,745 --> 01:25:42,949
- May we?
- Please.

1323
01:25:45,001 --> 01:25:47,238
- Oh, Will.
- We didn't know how else to thank you.

1324
01:25:47,722 --> 01:25:49,893
This is yours.
- Hi. Thank you.

1325
01:25:50,058 --> 01:25:51,302
Hi.

1326
01:25:52,201 --> 01:25:53,696
Hi.
- Hi.

1327
01:25:54,058 --> 01:25:56,425
Can't thank you enough, Miss Kittredge.

1328
01:25:58,634 --> 01:26:01,286
Oh, my good... Will.

1329
01:26:01,451 --> 01:26:03,652
You can make a big stew.
- I've never seen...

1330
01:26:03,816 --> 01:26:05,027
Hi. Thank you very much.

1331
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:07,560
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1332
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:16,450
Oh, please. Please. Don't go. I...

1333
01:26:17,226 --> 01:26:21,634
I can't think of a better way
to celebrate than with all of you.

1334
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:24,617
Please, won't you join us?

1335
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:26,884
We'd... We'd be honored.

1336
01:26:29,515 --> 01:26:31,108
Hello?

1337
01:26:34,763 --> 01:26:36,422
Dad?

1338
01:26:38,412 --> 01:26:39,819
Dad!

1339
01:26:42,219 --> 01:26:43,593
Oh!

1340
01:26:43,755 --> 01:26:44,802
Oh!

1341
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:50,084
Oh, Kit. Come here. Let me look at you.

1342
01:26:51,499 --> 01:26:53,541
Oh, sweetheart.

1343
01:26:57,421 --> 01:27:00,552
You promised me
that you would write to me once a week.

1344
01:27:00,714 --> 01:27:02,722
- And it's been...
- Too long.

1345
01:27:02,891 --> 01:27:03,906
I know, Kit.

1346
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:07,686
Every day I kept thinking,
"Tomorrow there'll be better news."

1347
01:27:08,716 --> 01:27:10,724
But there never was.

1348
01:27:11,628 --> 01:27:13,188
And then I realized...

1349
01:27:13,547 --> 01:27:15,490
...that if I couldn't face you...

1350
01:27:15,661 --> 01:27:18,596
...or your mother, if I couldn't tell you
what was happening...

1351
01:27:19,181 --> 01:27:21,221
...it was like that old car.

1352
01:27:21,389 --> 01:27:22,850
I was letting it beat me.

1353
01:27:23,469 --> 01:27:24,810
I won't let it beat me, honey.

1354
01:27:27,469 --> 01:27:28,451
Kit?

1355
01:27:33,549 --> 01:27:35,044
Jack?

1356
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:44,459
I'm here.

1357
01:27:52,302 --> 01:27:53,895
And I'm gonna find a job.

1358
01:27:54,222 --> 01:27:56,132
I promise.

1359
01:27:56,431 --> 01:27:57,642
In Chicago?

1360
01:28:01,197 --> 01:28:02,921
No, Kit.

1361
01:28:03,246 --> 01:28:05,189
Right here in Cincinnati.

1362
01:28:05,358 --> 01:28:07,530
I'm home to stay.

1363
01:28:19,246 --> 01:28:20,938
Want some more juice?

1364
01:28:28,016 --> 01:28:30,220
I just thank you. This is delicious.

1365
01:28:30,384 --> 01:28:32,272
Thank you.

1366
01:28:32,817 --> 01:28:33,798
Mr. Pennington.

1367
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,974
Thank you, sir.

1368
01:28:43,345 --> 01:28:46,279
That son you've got around my age...

1369
01:28:47,023 --> 01:28:48,780
...write him, please...

1370
01:28:49,264 --> 01:28:50,377
...tonight...

1371
01:28:50,897 --> 01:28:52,305
...for me.

1372
01:28:59,247 --> 01:29:01,801
- Excuse me. Everybody.
- Wait, wait.

1373
01:29:01,968 --> 01:29:03,758
Quiet, please, everybody.

1374
01:29:05,712 --> 01:29:08,527
Countee has something she has to say.

1375
01:29:08,945 --> 01:29:10,571
Ready?

1376
01:29:16,657 --> 01:29:21,479
"The cow jumped over the moon."

1377
01:29:21,649 --> 01:29:23,722
What's the cow doing
jumping over the moon?

1378
01:29:23,889 --> 01:29:25,319
- Ha, ha!
- That's just silly.

1379
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:28,523
All this time I've been trying to read,
and this is what they say?

1380
01:29:30,737 --> 01:29:32,014
Come here. Aw.

1381
01:29:33,362 --> 01:29:35,020
I'm proud of you.

1382
01:29:44,243 --> 01:29:45,257
Hi.

1383
01:29:46,034 --> 01:29:47,791
Kit, sweetheart.

1384
01:29:48,595 --> 01:29:50,635
There's someone here to see you.

1385
01:29:51,444 --> 01:29:53,807
Margaret Mildred Kittredge.

1386
01:29:53,968 --> 01:29:55,398
Mr. Gibson?

1387
01:29:55,826 --> 01:29:58,958
Here you go, kiddo. Hot off the presses.

1388
01:30:03,347 --> 01:30:07,886
- You mean?
- Congratulations, reporter. You're in print!

1389
01:30:08,051 --> 01:30:10,735
Mother, Dad, did you hear it? I'm in print!

1390
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:15,438
Oh, sweetheart, I knew you could do it.
I always knew.

1391
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:18,001
Come on, let's show everybody.

1392
01:30:19,028 --> 01:30:23,338
Mr. Gibson, won't you stay for one drink?
It's a holiday. We're all celebrating.

1393
01:30:23,508 --> 01:30:28,811
- Well, perhaps just one, Mrs...
- Oh, it's miss. Miss Dooley.

1394
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:31,403
- Huh.
- Hmm.

1395
01:30:31,764 --> 01:30:33,454
But you can call me May.

1396
01:30:34,324 --> 01:30:36,626
That was my mother's name.

1397
01:30:36,788 --> 01:30:38,578
Ha. Golly.

1398
01:30:38,741 --> 01:30:41,195
That is a coincidence.

1399
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:47,504
Well, what sort of drinks
are you preparing tonight?

1400
01:30:49,014 --> 01:30:52,721
<i>That November,</i>
<i>we didn't dwell on what we'd lost.</i>

1401
01:30:52,883 --> 01:30:55,786
<i>Rather, we celebrated what we had.</i>

1402
01:30:55,957 --> 01:30:57,037
Is everyone ready?

1403
01:30:57,556 --> 01:30:58,539
Yes.

1404
01:31:01,429 --> 01:31:03,119
All right, then.

1405
01:31:10,581 --> 01:31:12,436
We are now one.

1406
01:31:16,917 --> 01:31:19,471
Oh, my gosh.
- I'm one with the monkey.

1407
01:31:19,638 --> 01:31:20,783
Don't tell my mother.

1408
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:26,701
No, wait. We haven't done
the sacred Treehouse pledge.

1409
01:31:27,606 --> 01:31:30,257
<i>The Depression had changed</i>
<i>each one of our lives.</i>

1410
01:31:31,446 --> 01:31:35,440
<i>And while it made us struggle,</i>
<i>it also made us strong.</i>

1411
01:31:35,607 --> 01:31:37,363
Gwanga, gwanga, galoolie.

1412
01:31:37,527 --> 01:31:40,145
Gwanga, gwanga, galoolie.

1413
01:31:40,311 --> 01:31:41,579
Kit, look,
the monkey's got your camera.

1414
01:31:42,487 --> 01:31:44,943
<i>Now, no matter what life had in store...</i>

1415
01:31:46,552 --> 01:31:48,557
<i>... I was ready.</i>

1416
01:31:50,391 --> 01:32:00,277
THE END
