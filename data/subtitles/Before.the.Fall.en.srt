1
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:44,208
Friedrich, time for a break !

2
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:59,958
- Friedrich, here's your day loan.
- Thank you.

3
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:02,708
Friedrich, watch where you're going !

4
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:11,000
Berlin Wedding, Late Summer 1942

5
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:39,250
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Yes, I see that. What's up?

6
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:40,875
I had to work.

7
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:43,750
This fight is very important
for us, understand?

8
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,542
Is that them?

9
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,917
Yes.

10
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:51,875
Students from Napola,
our new elite.

11
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:57,417
They may look nerdy. But don't worry,
they aren't any different than you.

12
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:08,542
Alright, you made it. But
don't get too excited about it.

13
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:14,708
What's up, punk?
Want a punch in the mug?

14
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,958
You won't be any uglier
than now, anyway.

15
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,417
And you?

16
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,292
Did you say something?

17
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,875
I don't hear anything...

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,958
What's going on here?

19
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,292
Is everything okay?

20
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,000
Next !

21
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,833
Good job !

22
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,583
Nicely done, you'll make it.

23
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,292
And don't forget to cover !

24
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,042
Box !

25
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,750
Attack him !

26
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:37,083
Now ! Catch him !

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,583
And nail him !
Bring it on ! Hit him !

28
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,208
Hold still...

29
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,500
Great fight.

30
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:07,458
You fought well,
Congratulations.

31
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,750
Heil Hitler !

32
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,958
I saw your fight,
I like your style.

33
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:22,958
- What school are you from?
- None, I just graduated.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,458
Did you hear about
the Fuhrer's schools?

35
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,542
Hitler's educational
outposts?

36
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:35,542
I teach Boxing and German at such a
school, at the Napola, in Allenstein.

37
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,542
We're currently
accepting applications.

38
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:44,500
If you report there tomorrow
morning, I may be able to help you.

39
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,625
What's your name?

40
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,958
Friedrich Weimer.

41
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,417
I'm Heinrich Vogler.

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,458
You've got talent, Friedrich.

43
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,417
Man, they're the "Elite"!

44
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,083
- Really?
- Sure !

45
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,583
They only accept the best.

46
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,833
-Heil Hitler, Friedrich.
-Heil Hitler.

47
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,917
It's good of you to come.

48
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:11,042
First we have to conduct some medical
procedures, then, it's the dexterity exam.

49
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,417
Understood?

50
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,667
Good.
Then get in queue.

51
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,458
Thirteen.

52
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,125
Ten.

53
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,083
Eye color?

54
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,042
15.

55
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,875
Hair color?

56
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,417
B.

57
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,208
Why did you choose this
school, youngster?

58
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,208
Because I want to serve the Fuhrer,
my country, and my motherland.

59
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,250
Nordic type,
class 1-B.

60
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,167
Where have you been?

61
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:56,167
- Boxing.
- At this late hour?

62
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,500
No, I...

63
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:06,667
I was applying to
the Napola school.

64
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,792
What did u say?

65
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,917
-You won't go there.
-But, papa...

66
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:27,292
It's a big chance for me, I
can become whomever I want...

67
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,458
Under no circumstance !

68
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,000
It's already too much, what
Hitlerjugend does to you all.

69
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,000
You're not going to any elite school. 

70
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:36,833
You're going to work in a factory !
End of discussion !

71
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:41,250
Why not? I'll get a secondary
school certificate there.

72
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:44,708
And you wouldn't have to pay...

73
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,375
Do as I say.

74
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:49,917
We've got nothing in common
with those people, understood?

75
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,333
Yes, father.

76
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:07,000
Why did dad get mad?

77
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,500
He won't let me go to that school.

78
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:12,542
What school?

79
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,542
A special one.

80
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:19,750
It's located in a castle,
they've got everything there,

81
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:25,250
showers, boxing hall,
not to mention the gliders.

82
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:30,750
After you graduate from
there, you become the elite,

83
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,875
and don't have to worry
about money anymore.

84
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,958
And dad doesn't want
to let you go there?

85
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It sounds really great !

86
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:52,667
You feel dirtier leaving this,
than when you enter it.

87
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,000
Same difference.

88
00:09:55,042 --> 00:10:01,167
You'll report first to Kindler,
then you'll start working in a month.

89
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,625
In one month?

90
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:10,458
So that you won't have any
time for stupid thoughts.

91
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, are you happy?

92
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:41,375
I'd rather stay here.

93
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,125
That's so stupid.

94
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,708
It'll be great.

95
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,625
Such a kindergarten is
just like a summer camp.

96
00:10:52,667 --> 00:11:01,083
You won't have to sit in a bunker all day,
and all your friends will be there too.

97
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:13,583
Hey...Is this the way for a
young German to behave?

98
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:09,417
Dear mother,
Don't be angry at me.

99
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:14,917
But I believe that this is the
chance of my lifetime. Your Friedrich.

100
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:23,250
Dear father, I forged your
signature on the permission.

101
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:28,375
If you pull me out of Napola,
I'll report all of

102
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:34,208
the bad things that you've
been saying about it.

103
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:47,875
Wake up, young man. We've
reached our destination.

104
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,292
Could you drop me
off right here?

105
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,875
Yes, sure I can.

106
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,750
- Thanks so much.
- You're very welcome.

107
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,250
But mom, I've already...

108
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:45,375
But Dad's just
butchered a pig...

109
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:59,792
No food?
Brought enough?

110
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,542
Stand still. Hug your
brother and smile.

111
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,625
What a beautiful Summer,
Mr. Von Brock.

112
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:12,375
- lndeed.
- Madam...

113
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,833
Friedrich.  Heil Hitler !

114
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,292
Good to see you. See? Your
dad finally let you come.

115
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,500
Not really,
but I came anyway.

116
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,083
Ah...
But, who signed your permission?

117
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,667
I did.

118
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,750
Well, at least you admit doing it.

119
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:43,667
A real sportsman
always tells the truth.

120
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:49,125
Well, that's exactly
what you're going to

121
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:54,500
learn here. Come,
we'll get you your uniform.

122
00:15:56,583 --> 00:16:02,292
- One clothing set,
in the right size, please. - Yes, sir !

123
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:06,292
We rarely admit
people of your age,

124
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:12,583
but you caught my eye.
I hope you can appreciate it.

125
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,125
Ah, Schneider, come here !

126
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:18,500
This is Friedrich Weimer,
he's new here... for your room.

127
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:22,042
Show him everything and
introduce him to friends.

128
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,333
Yes, sir !

129
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:28,583
I'm Christoph,
welcome to Allenstein.

130
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,958
Thanks.

131
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,583
Good, I'll show you the room first, then
you can change your clothes. -Uh huh.

132
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:40,792
Hey Hubscher, now WE've
got an Aryan too !

133
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,792
So, this is it !

134
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,042
So, this is your bed,
and that's your locker.

135
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:00,625
Track suit, denim-- bottom left,
sewing kit, clothes brush-- to the left.

136
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,458
top right--
private things.

137
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,750
Your cap's not supposed to lay,
but stand, on the brown shirt.

138
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,667
On the bottom--
towel, handkerchiefs.

139
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:13,208
Suitcase on top,
toiletries-- on the door hook.

140
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,458
Ok, keep your things 'straightened', or
the orderly will throw everything out.

141
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,292
You'll understand the rest. Oh,
and you're going to buy dessert.

142
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,667
What??

143
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,583
Never mind.
The first time doesn't count.

144
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,750
Boys, the assembly
is in 15 minutes !

145
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:34,875
Good, get changed,
then, come downstairs.

146
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,042
Friedrich ! Friedrich !

147
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,000
Over here !

148
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,458
Have a seat.

149
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,333
Be seated.

150
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,917
Young men !

151
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,583
Students !

152
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,917
I'd like to warmly welcome you to
our school in the new year of 1942.

153
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:31,042
I'd like to inform all new students
that they have come to the place,

154
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:35,500
where their future
will be shaped.

155
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:41,125
A farmer's son and an industrialist's
one are equals in this school.

156
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:46,750
Namely, you'll be the future elite
of a one thousand year old reich.

157
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:49,750
Men may create history,

158
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:52,708
but, WE
make the men.

159
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:59,792
To my uncut diamonds, we will keep
splitting and polishing you for as long

160
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:04,875
as it takes, until a shiny,
precious jewel emerges.

161
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,083
And when the final victory arrives,

162
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,417
we will need many new
regional party leaders.

163
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,792
And I don't mean just
for just Cartnen

164
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:18,917
or Mecklemburg, but posts
for Washington, Moscow,

165
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,125
London, or even Cape Town.

166
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:26,000
Make good use of your time here.

167
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:32,417
Sharpen your body and mind.
And be faithful, loyal companions.

168
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:36,375
We would like to say 3
times, a loud Sieg Heil...

169
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:41,125
to our brave soldiers
fighting on the frontlines of

170
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:45,667
the Reich and for our
beloved leader Adolf Hitler !

171
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,667
Listen, guys,
this is Friedrich Weimer.

172
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,417
He's new to the school
and to our room.

173
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,042
- Hi.
- Bon Appetit.

174
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,667
That's our Wilhelm,
we call him Hefe.

175
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,833
His father is head of catering.

176
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:44,292
- and that's why this minced meat
passed inspection. - Don't listen to him.

177
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,708
You still didn't tell me what you
wanted in return for your notebooks.

178
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,500
Yeah, 300 grams
of fine liverwurst.

179
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,125
- 300 grams? You must be joking ?!?
- No.

180
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:58,875
But as an extra reward I'll give
you a glimpse of the photo, huh?

181
00:21:58,917 --> 00:21:59,750
This is Tjaden.

182
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:03,292
He's the room champion
for the longest fart. -Hi.

183
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,333
The current record
is 8,5 seconds.

184
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,333
What's with this
whole 'photo' thing?

185
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:13,625
-Of my 3 sisters, all sweaty from dancing.
-What?

186
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:17,792
- My best source of income.
- I also trade socks for 2 marks.

187
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:21,917
- Does anybody buy this?
- You haven't met my sisters yet.

188
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,583
The one in the back
is Siggi...

189
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,250
Watch out !
Jaucher's coming !

190
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:28,375
Quick !

191
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,333
Friedrich, line up !

192
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,250
Attention !

193
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:46,708
- Is this our new recruit?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,250
Name??

195
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,292
Weimer, Friedrich.

196
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:02,000
I see, so YOU'RE the one ?!

197
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:06,125
You're quite famous,
for a new student.

198
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:09,292
Then you've got
to be pretty good.

199
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,208
Whose mess is this?

200
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,167
Move it, clean it up.

201
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,833
Stop sleeping !

202
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,208
Twenty push-ups, now !

203
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,542
One, two, three, four...

204
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,292
What's going on here?

205
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,500
Locker control.

206
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,708
Get up.

207
00:23:56,625 --> 00:24:00,792
Enough.
The boy is new.

208
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:04,500
Yes, sir.

209
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,458
Fall out.

210
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,500
You've just made your first enemy.

211
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,625
- Christoph?
- What?

212
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:42,083
- I just wanted to ask...
-It's forbidden to talk during 'lights out'.

213
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:30,458
[ Albrecht's Nocturnal Arrival ]

214
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:58,292
Get up ! Make the beds up !
Morning gymnastics !

215
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:12,500
Faster, Friedrich.

216
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,500
Thanks.

217
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:30,542
Sure, no problem. I learned
this at my previous school.

218
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:34,375
-I'm Friedrich.
- Albrecht.

219
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:36,042
Can't it go any faster?

220
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:41,083
This snail's pace of yours is
really beginning to bug me...

221
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,583
Move it to the assembly square !

222
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,750
Move your asses, don't be such sand bags !

223
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:02,083
I'll teach you a lesson !

224
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:06,000
You'll see the smoke coming
out of your asses !

225
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,417
Get in line !

226
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,375
Faster !

227
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,167
Now on the ground !

228
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,458
Push-ups !

229
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,750
One, two !

230
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:22,750
Schulze, straight shoulders !

231
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:25,500
Kruger, lower to the ground !

232
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:33,375
Siegfried Gladen has
pissed his pants again.

233
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:36,750
Attention !

234
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:41,542
Student Gladen,
three steps forward !

235
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:49,542
Go and get your mattress.

236
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:07,667
Take off your trousers.

237
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:15,167
- What? - You're to take off
your trousers, for God's sake !

238
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:22,417
Now start peeing.

239
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:27,542
C'mon, faster !!!

240
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,167
As you wish...

241
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:38,292
We'll bow, lie down, and jump !

242
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:41,375
Starting from now !

243
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:44,458
One, two, three.

244
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:55,625
Keep on jumping 'til this young
man finally decides to pee.

245
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:21,375
Alright, everybody stand up !

246
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,708
Thank him.

247
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:35,875
Take that mattress and get the
hell out my sight ! Fucking pisser !

248
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,375
The one who doesn't know how
to fight in this world of immortal war

249
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:45,042
is not worth life.

250
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,208
Bon appetit.

251
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,292
Young men !

252
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:55,792
I'd like to welcome a son of a great man,
of a good and personal friend of mine,

253
00:29:55,833 --> 00:30:00,125
and a party birth time companion.
With great pleasure:

254
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:03,375
Albrecht Stein,

255
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:06,250
son of our regional party
leader: Heinrich Stein.

256
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:10,250
-A very hearty welcome !
-Welcome !

257
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:16,417
Welcome Albrecht.

258
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:23,708
You're lucky, you were
given the best room.

259
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:29,375
Who's that?

260
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,333
That's Katharina.

261
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:36,167
- But she's already engaged in case
you wanted to know. - Who said that?

262
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,042
I did, you pig.

263
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:51,750
...something that Darwin
called species' evolution

264
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:56,208
can also be applied to "nation's
struggle for life" theory.

265
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,625
Today we'll cover the topic

266
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:02,500
"Roman writers and the Jew problem."

267
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:04,917
What means does Fuhrer...

268
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:08,000
...use to lead the party to victory?

269
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:14,458
Extermination of the weaker
guarantees survival of the stronger,

270
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,833
just like in the animal world.

271
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,833
Which Martin Luther
quotation fits here?

272
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,750
...and don't you even
dare to doubt...

273
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:24,958
...that, excluding the Devil,
he's the most furious

274
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,333
stubborn enemy of yours.

275
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:32,875
A real Jew will always be a Jew.

276
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:47,833
A modern bomber
carries 1800 bombs.

277
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:53,083
What area will he be able
to drop the bombs on

278
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:57,833
if he drops 1 bomb per second...

279
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:01,958
with the speed of 250
kilometers per hour?

280
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:38,167
What is it?

281
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:47,375
Preacher brought the names of
all the men killed on the front...

282
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:02,125
Are we here alone?

283
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,375
Yes.

284
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:12,500
Shall we begin?

285
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:18,042
Concentrate.

286
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,708
Harder !

287
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:27,792
C'mon.  More force !
Don't sleep !

288
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,125
Put your guard up !

289
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,375
You're to take him out !

290
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:34,625
Get your fists up !

291
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,875
Your fists up !

292
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,708
Move it !

293
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,875
You've got the strength and the skills, but
you still have to work on your technique.

294
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:45,375
Don't punch if you lack balance.

295
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,792
Use front hits only if you
feel you've got the advantage.

296
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:51,292
Of course, be as strong
as you can, understand?

297
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:56,500
At such moments you've got to
completely forget about being 'humane'.

298
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:58,958
This whole compassion
thing is just bullshit.

299
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,250
Only by doing so, will you
use your whole potential,

300
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:07,208
and be ready for bigger fights.

301
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,333
What big fights?

302
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:14,833
Come with me.

303
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:21,167
Here: the glory years of our boxers.

304
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:25,500
Frenz Jensen in 1937
at Napola's championships.

305
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:29,833
We were the best of all
the schools in the country.

306
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,000
And after that?

307
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:36,375
Well, since then, Potsdam
took over the cup.

308
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:38,625
When are the next Championships
going to take place?

309
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:39,875
In the winter.

310
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:43,458
If you train hard enough
you might take part in it.

311
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,542
Really?

312
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:50,292
Yes, who knows?

313
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:54,875
So, get under the shower.

314
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:26,417
Without mercy.

315
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:32,792
It's the only way he'll learn.

316
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:44,542
- Were you hit in the nose?
- Hehe, you're all sweaty !

317
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,083
Mail !

318
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:49,208
Hey, that's mine.

319
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:56,250
Friedrich,
a package for you.

320
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:58,458
The bathing photo !

321
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,542
- Yeah. - Look here, I was
supposed to get ALL of them !

322
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:05,167
You were just supposed
to have a look. Let's see.

323
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:12,417
- Want a glimpse? - Hey, why is he
allowed to look without paying?

324
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:15,667
Because you moan and
groan too much, Hefe.

325
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:18,875
Hey, you can't do that !

326
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,125
Just a little while...

327
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,375
C'mon, Christoph, please !

328
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,375
Dear Friedrich,
I hope that you are well.

329
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:40,042
I don't know if you know, but Dad was
visited by the Gestapo in the factory,

330
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:43,167
and now he must
work double-shifts.

331
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:46,250
Don't tell him that
I wrote to you.

332
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:48,750
Always be careful and brave.

333
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:52,083
Hans, under the circumstances
is doing well.

334
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:58,625
I miss you both very much. Looking
forward to hearing from you. Your mother.

335
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,250
Oh, yuck, you human pig !

336
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:07,917
Everybody, just take a deep
breath together, and it'll be over.

337
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:18,375
Yes?

338
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:22,917
Did you finish cleaning up?

339
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:31,375
- Do you head the school newspaper?
- I'm going to, starting from next issue.

340
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:33,500
Do you like to write?

341
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:36,917
Actually I do.

342
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:46,875
What do you have there?

343
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:49,958
My essays from my old school.

344
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
They've just been
sent back to me.

345
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,083
And?

346
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,292
Take a look yourself.

347
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,458
Give it back!

348
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:12,542
I'll put back the pages
that have fallen out.

349
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:16,625
See? there's nearly none left.

350
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:20,792
Now they're all here.

351
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:30,292
My mom always says that
everything I write is wonderful,

352
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:34,292
but she's never actually
read anything till the end.

353
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,000
If I were you I'd be happy.

354
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,042
It's like winning a battle
without having to fight.

355
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,042
No,

356
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:51,583
it's like being given a medal because
of their not wanting to see you fight.

357
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,667
Give it to me.

358
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,625
What do you need it for?

359
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:01,292
- I want to read it.
- You want to read a school essay?

360
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:02,917
Sure.

361
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:05,833
Are you afraid of my opinion?

362
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,417
No.

363
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,917
So?

364
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,000
Friedrich.

365
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:18,417
Um..would you like to
see "something" ?

366
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,042
- When did you discover this?
- Today.  This afternoon.

367
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,917
Do you really want
to take a look?

368
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:35,208
Yes, you'll help me up
and then I'll look.

369
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,833
Why should you be the first?

370
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:40,250
Because I found it. Besides I've
got to check if the coast is clear.

371
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:43,833
- You'll be a back guard.
-  But, I'd rather be a front guard.

372
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,500
Friedrich, please !

373
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:51,250
Okay, but only because
you discovered it.

374
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,667
And?
Do you see anything?

375
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,083
No, there's no one here.

376
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,542
Let me look.

377
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:13,708
There's nobody here.

378
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,250
What are you doing?

379
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:21,208
- It's MY turn.
-I've already said: there's no one there.

380
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:25,125
Doesn't matter !

381
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,042
And?
See anything?

382
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:46,583
Nothing. Nobody. Just like you said.

383
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,917
Shit !

384
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:07,583
Friedrich?

385
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,625
Yes?

386
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:15,792
How did you know she was there?

387
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:21,458
You held your breath for a moment.

388
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:27,667
Ready?

389
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:28,875
Ready.

390
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:34,625
Tug it!

391
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:38,958
Pull it!

392
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:46,042
Pull it, faster!

393
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:42,292
Goddamn it,
you're supposed to jump higher !

394
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:45,125
What a bunch of clumsy assholes !

395
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:47,917
Silence, let your sobbing be heard.

396
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,583
Follow me,

397
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:53,083
sightly virgin Freyn.

398
00:43:56,875 --> 00:44:01,500
"Gods have you been
foiling, noble knight,

399
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:06,125
but I'm afraid that
dragon will you not bite."

400
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:12,625
Na,na, that is German poetry for
you, gentlemen. Carry on.

401
00:44:32,542 --> 00:44:34,792
Oh! I'm sorry !

402
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:39,625
No, never apologize !
No one says: I'm sorry ! Come !

403
00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:46,833
And?

404
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:51,833
Well, it's ok.

405
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:53,875
Just ok???

406
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:59,042
It is good.
REALLY good !

407
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,417
Remember what I said:

408
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,167
Fight until he's out cold.

409
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:16,792
Only one of you can win.

410
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:20,833
If you make it through 2 rounds,
you've got a chance to win.

411
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:27,208
Make him cry !

412
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,375
You know the rules, fight
until the knock out !

413
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,500
To your corners !

414
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:59,125
Box !

415
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:27,500
Stop !

416
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,667
Alright...box !

417
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,958
Hit him, Friedrich !

418
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,875
Believe in yourself and hit him !

419
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:03,750
You're fighting 'till the knock out !

420
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:52,792
Friedrich wins by knock
out ! Friedrich Weimer !

421
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,958
Congratulations, my boy,
first class fight.

422
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,208
Thank you.

423
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:24,292
So short with us, and so much
progress made, an excellent example.

424
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:27,458
If we take over Potsdam's
cup in the winter,

425
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,958
I'll put in a good word for you
at the Berlin sport school.

426
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,750
The next Olympics are
just around the corner.

427
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:37,292
Keep on training.

428
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,583
We have great faith in you.

429
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:44,042
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

430
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:05,833
What's wrong?

431
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:08,750
Nothing.

432
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:13,833
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

433
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,958
You had no mercy,

434
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,458
he was already hanging on the ropes.

435
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,417
So?

436
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,458
He'd have done exactly
the same to me.

437
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,333
I've just seen him, and
he's still unconscious.

438
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,542
What did you expect?

439
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:35,833
- Would you rather see ME lying there?
- You didn't have to be so brutal.

440
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:38,750
- Are you maybe jealous of my victory?
- No

441
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:42,083
But couldn't you have
achieved it in a different way?

442
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:46,500
- No, I couldn't have !

443
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:00,250
Get up !

444
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,375
Siegfried,

445
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:16,333
where are you going so fast?

446
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:19,208
To the bathroom.

447
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,083
Turn around.

448
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:33,333
You're a shameful stain
on the school's honor.

449
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:38,708
What if the Fuhrer came tomorrow
and your room stunk of pee?

450
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:44,917
- What would your sport instructor
think about it?   - Please, no, I...

451
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:49,708
For 20 marks I'll forget the whole thing.

452
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:54,208
- I don't have that much money on me.
-  Then:  GET IT !

453
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:58,833
If you don't find it
before supper, your 

454
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:04,083
sport instructor will be
informed of your problem.

455
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:08,583
- Everything ok, Siegfried?
- Yeah.

456
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:13,167
A hand grenade has
an exploding range

457
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:16,125
of approximately 15 meters.

458
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:19,500
And it's splintered fragments
may fly even further.

459
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
To sum up:

460
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:26,125
Unscrew the lid,

461
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:31,250
pull the line -
and now it's triggered and sharp.

462
00:51:31,292 --> 00:51:33,875
Then we make a wide sweeping motion,

463
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:36,500
we throw it, then, take cover.

464
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:41,917
After pulling the line you've got
4,5 seconds till detonation.

465
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:44,583
Are there any questions?

466
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:46,583
Fine...

467
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,750
Christoph, come.

468
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:14,708
So: Pull it. Sweeping motion.
Throw. Duck.

469
00:52:19,417 --> 00:52:21,083
Very good.

470
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,083
Friedrich, next. Come.

471
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:35,917
So: Pull it. Sweeping motion.

472
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:38,500
Throw. Duck.

473
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,625
Wilhelm.

474
00:52:57,625 --> 00:53:00,417
And: Pull it. Sweeping motion.

475
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:02,958
Throw. Duck.

476
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,042
Albrecht, come.

477
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:25,292
And: Pull it.
Sweeping motion.

478
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:27,625
Throw it.
I said: THROW IT !

479
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,000
TAKE COVER !

480
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,750
GODDAMMIT !

481
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:44,958
Martin. Come.

482
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:58,667
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ??
THROW IT !!

483
00:54:50,042 --> 00:54:53,750
Our regional party leader has come

484
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:58,667
to pay a last tribute to
our hero's memory.

485
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:39,333
We are gathered here today
to pay tribute and to honor

486
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:41,583
the memory of our comrade,

487
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:45,417
Siegfried Gladen.

488
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:49,458
In a moment of terrible
and grave danger,

489
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,458
he sacrificed himself
for the good of others.

490
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,667
He gave up his own life

491
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:59,875
to save the lives of
twenty of his comrades.

492
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:02,167
The young man

493
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:05,333
who lies here now at this funeral

494
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:10,125
has filled the last seconds of
his life, not with hesitation,

495
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:13,208
but with action.

496
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,792
Our times don't need

497
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:18,250
timid solutions.

498
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:21,333
We don't need metrosexualists,

499
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:24,292
but men who actually do something.

500
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:28,250
Every one of us, standing
here now, should ask himself:

501
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:32,167
Why wasn't it me who
jumped on that grenade?

502
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:35,333
Did he find at that very moment,

503
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:39,917
the lives of his friends to be
more valuable than his own?

504
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:44,042
If so, why?

505
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,542
Our bodies are not our own property

506
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,167
but our nation's,

507
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,375
our country's

508
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:55,792
and before all, our Fuhrer's.

509
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:02,375
And what?... What can be a
better ending for our lives,

510
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:04,458
than a heroic death?

511
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:15,417
Siegfried Gladen,

512
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:19,000
our nation thanks you

513
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:25,083
and assures you that
it will never forget you.

514
00:57:40,042 --> 00:57:41,833
Lower !

515
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:45,583
I can't believe my own eyes !

516
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:51,583
It can always be done
just a little bit better.

517
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:54,167
Don't let the tiredness get to you !

518
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:59,083
Enough !

519
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:04,875
Young men,

520
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:08,208
today we'll practice high jumps,

521
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,792
my favorite sport discipline.

522
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:17,042
It requires absolute body control,

523
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:20,167
stomach muscles must
be hard as a stiff board,

524
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,542
as they support the whole body.

525
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,708
If you bend at the waist,

526
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,917
you won't achieve a thing.

527
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:32,417
Hard as a stiff board.

528
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,750
Who wants to try first?

529
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:40,125
Come here, boxer kid.

530
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:44,583
Hard as a stiff board. Go on.

531
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,875
Well? Hit me.

532
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,333
Fine,

533
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:11,875
Line up for first the jump !

534
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:31,542
Quite a brave act.

535
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:34,917
Will you come home
with me on Sunday?

536
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:38,833
It's my father's birthday.

537
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:42,625
- Heil Hitler, master Stein.
- Heil Hitler, Johan.

538
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:39,042
Albrecht, finally.
Good to see you.

539
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:43,417
Friedrich? I've heard so
much about you. Welcome.

540
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:46,375
- Thank's for the invitation.
- No need for thanks.

541
01:00:46,417 --> 01:00:50,917
- Mom, l...
- Tell me later, dear.

542
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:55,000
Come. Show me your room.

543
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,667
Not bad.

544
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:01,750
Yup, everything was already here...

545
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:06,000
- In the whole house?
- Yup.

546
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:14,167
Quick, quick quick !

547
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:38,583
Thank you, I'm very touched.

548
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:57,125
Happy Birthday.

549
01:01:57,167 --> 01:02:00,750
Good evening, father.
Happy Birthday.

550
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:02,625
Thank you, Albrecht.

551
01:02:02,667 --> 01:02:05,667
You've lost weight.
Are you playing enough sports?

552
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:10,458
Sure, of course.  Naturally.

553
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,625
This is Friedrich.

554
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:15,250
- You know...
- Of course.

555
01:02:15,292 --> 01:02:17,750
I've heard alot about
your boxing skills.

556
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:18,792
A warm welcome.

557
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,500
Dear Heinrich,

558
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:37,542
on behalf of your old mates
we wish you the very best,

559
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:41,250
and a good start in Warthegau.

560
01:02:41,292 --> 01:02:45,917
I hope you've got enough skills
to clean up the local mess !

561
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:48,292
Cheers !

562
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,000
Dear father,

563
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:06,875
I wrote a small
birthday poem for you.

564
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:12,625
Here it goes:

565
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:14,083
- At first...
- Thank you,

566
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:19,708
Albrecht, thank you very much.
I'll listen to it later.

567
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,292
Dear Franz,

568
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:31,333
party companions,

569
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:35,500
Thank you for this great party.

570
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:37,333
Let me tell you

571
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:40,083
that the task I was given

572
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,750
fills me with great pride.

573
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:47,583
I know, that it wouldn't have
been granted to me, in Berlin.

574
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:50,667
Some people simply can't
understand my methods.

575
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:55,333
But in this country, it's the Fuhrer
who decides, not the bureaucrats.

576
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:59,458
Cheers !
Carl.  Willhelm.  Franz.

577
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:07,500
How's your combat training?

578
01:04:07,542 --> 01:04:13,583
- Good.  - Albrecht's going to be a
Waffen SS officer after school.

579
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:20,250
Ah, then tasks of strength
might not be all that...

580
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:22,792
So, you're the boxer, are you?

581
01:04:23,042 --> 01:04:25,583
- And in perfect shape, I've heard.

582
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:29,833
- Really? Then maybe you could
show us some of your'moves'?

583
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:31,375
An excellent idea !

584
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:32,458
Gentlemen,

585
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:36,958
after dinner, I invite you to the
cellar, where our young elite

586
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,250
will show us something VERY special.

587
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:46,792
What a great idea.

588
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:56,500
Surprised, aren't you?

589
01:04:56,833 --> 01:05:01,167
-I train in my free time to keep in shape.
-Undress !

590
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:04,708
- Undress?
- Yes, you'll show us what you've learned.

591
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:11,375
- But Albrecht does't...
- Ahhh, every German should box.

592
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,917
And...Box !

593
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:29,167
What's that supposed to be?

594
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:33,583
Fight honestly, you don't
have to spare anyone here.

595
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:37,250
Fight honestly,

596
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:38,792
No.

597
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,417
Hit me !

598
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:47,958
- No.
- You're to box !

599
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,333
Hit me, coward !

600
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:57,125
You're to fight !

601
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:09,208
Albrecht !

602
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:17,833
Don't you worry.
Great punch.

603
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,917
Genius.

604
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:22,792
Hans, give our young
people some vodlka.

605
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:25,375
Our country needs
people like you.

606
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:31,792
More people like you on the Eastern front,
and we can close that chapter for good.

607
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:35,708
Cheers !

608
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:40,333
- But, sir...
- No refusing Heinrich.

609
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:57,833
- Shall we, young master?
- Yes, let's go.

610
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:34,083
Albrecht, listen...
[  Big sigh  ]

611
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:44,417
Attention !

612
01:07:57,458 --> 01:08:00,000
About face !

613
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:03,458
Young men...

614
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:09,167
Good news for you. Due
to intensified air battles

615
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:12,250
Wehrmacht has requested
some of Napola's students.

616
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:18,333
Yesterday our whole
eighth grade volunteered.

617
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:21,250
They're off to terrify the enemy !

618
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:24,125
And I'm filled with pride

619
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:28,125
that our second school certificate students

620
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:33,167
have embraced
the call, and have not

621
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:37,458
chosen to run from danger.

622
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:42,083
Heil Hitler, young men !
Heil Hitler !

623
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:52,833
Well, at least, they no
longer have to be here...

624
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:08,000
How long are you going
to stay mad at me?

625
01:09:08,042 --> 01:09:09,833
I'm not mad.

626
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:13,875
I'm afraid.

627
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:17,958
Of what?

628
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:34,000
Friedrich,

629
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:38,708
Wake up.

630
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:46,500
What's going on?

631
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:54,167
It's your father.

632
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:58,708
Let's Go !
Fall in line !

633
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,333
Attention !

634
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,125
Seventh grade reporting, sir.

635
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:24,208
Heil Hitler, young men !
Heil Hitler !

636
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:26,542
At ease.

637
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:30,750
Young men, we've got a problem.

638
01:10:30,792 --> 01:10:35,667
Day before yesterday, a transport
with war prisoners arrived at Allenstein.

639
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:40,458
12 Russians escaped into
the forests near Karlstadt.

640
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,125
They overpowered two guards,

641
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:44,833
and stole their weapons.

642
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:48,875
Nobody knows the local
area better than you do.

643
01:10:48,917 --> 01:10:50,917
So I ask for your help.

644
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:53,583
If you wish to take part
in this dangerous mission,

645
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,167
and help recapture
these wild monsters:

646
01:10:56,208 --> 01:11:01,917
Answer loudly: Yes, sir !
- Yes, sir !

647
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,542
Then, let's go !

648
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,000
Faster !

649
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,125
Take the ammo by yourself.

650
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:13,875
Live ammunition?

651
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:16,208
And what did you think?

652
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:18,625
That we were going to catch
them with our bare hands?  Next.

653
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:19,958
Go, go !

654
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:21,167
Get in !

655
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:27,125
Forward !

656
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:16,958
Young men. Do your best.
Don't let them escape.

657
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,208
I'll award the most zealous units

658
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:23,875
with a Contribution Cross myself.

659
01:12:23,917 --> 01:12:24,917
Load your weapons !

660
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:31,000
Unlock them !

661
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,375
March off !

662
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:38,541
Halt.  Don't move !

663
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:08,875
Halt !!!

664
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:11,291
Hands up,
or I'll shoot !

665
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:28,166
I saw one there, he had
something in his hands.

666
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:58,458
Oh my god, they're just children !

667
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:04,083
Bandages ! Hand them to me ! Hurry !!

668
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:15,666
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.

669
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:21,666
It won't be any help !
Albrecht !

670
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:41,541
Everything's ok...Calm down...
Everything will be fine...

671
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:37,000
He's dead.

672
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:39,833
It's high time.

673
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:41,541
Let's go !

674
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:43,791
What's happened here?

675
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,041
Report.

676
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:49,208
Five captives shot while trying to escape.

677
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,250
- Is that the last one?
- Yes.

678
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:53,666
Stand back, Albrecht.

679
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:59,791
Father, NO !!!

680
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,833
Don't you DARE defy me in public again !
Understand??

681
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:10,750
- DO you understand?!!
- Yes, father.

682
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:12,166
Good job, young men.

683
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:15,041
Let's go, there's more of
them to recapture.

684
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:17,291
You too ! Get moving ! And fast !

685
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:23,125
- Sir, we...
- Why suddenly the:  "Sir"  ?

686
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,458
Yes, of course, I mean:  Heinrich.

687
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:28,416
Come, Albrecht.

688
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:35,666
Let's go. Move it.

689
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:51,541
- Pull yourself together !
- Pull myself together??

690
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:57,208
Do you know what
we've just done??

691
01:17:57,250 --> 01:18:01,500
We didn't have to shoot !

692
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:04,625
I didn't give you an order !

693
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:07,833
But your father said
that they were armed !

694
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:10,583
What are you staring at??

695
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:12,208
I'm not looking at you.

696
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:16,125
I know what you're thinking...

697
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:20,166
Don't look at me like that !!!

698
01:18:21,166 --> 01:18:23,708
- Albrecht !
- Stay here.

699
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,916
It won't do any good.

700
01:18:42,875 --> 01:18:47,416
Hey Weimer,
were you the one who shot him?

701
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:49,500
Hey, say something.
Answer my question.

702
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:52,333
I asked you something.

703
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:55,333
Are you deaf ??

704
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:02,708
- Break it up !
- I'll take care of it.

705
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:05,333
Take their weapons.

706
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:10,458
Are you out of your minds??
This is a combat mission !

707
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,041
Get in.

708
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:57,291
Let's go.

709
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:05,250
You're lucky the Russians
didn't abduct you.

710
01:20:05,291 --> 01:20:08,083
You'll be leaving jail tomorrow.

711
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:10,208
You, that way.

712
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:58,791
Christoph?

713
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,708
Shut up, Hefe.

714
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:06,333
- I'd like to talk...
- Shut the fuck up.

715
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,166
Attention !

716
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:28,375
Sit down !

717
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:37,375
Take out your notebooks,
you're going to write an essay:

718
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:43,375
"Winter landscape as a background
for German Knight Sagas."

719
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:47,250
You've got an hour,
starting from now.

720
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:33,375
Alright, your time's up.

721
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:42,541
Christoph, come to the
front and start reading.

722
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:45,083
Please.

723
01:22:48,708 --> 01:22:53,625
German landscape as a
background for German Knight Sagas.

724
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:57,708
German landscape is a very important
background for Knight Sagas.

725
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,250
Oh, really, Christoph?

726
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:01,583
The earliest sources prove

727
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:04,666
the enormous role of winter
landscape in historic...

728
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:07,041
Enough. Take your seat.

729
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:09,833
Albrecht, come, you'll read.

730
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:20,791
Please.

731
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:27,416
Despite being a bit childish,

732
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:32,416
winter and a view of freshly
fallen snow awakens in us

733
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:36,041
a feeling of inexplicable joy.

734
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:41,541
Perhaps because as children, we
think of snow in relation to Christmas...

735
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:47,416
In my dreams I am the hero who
saves the virgin from the dragon.

736
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:51,875
One who frees the
world from evil.

737
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:56,041
When searching for
the escapees yesterday,

738
01:23:56,083 --> 01:24:00,041
I remembered the boy who
wanted to save the world from evil.

739
01:24:00,083 --> 01:24:01,333
Albrecht, enough.

740
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:07,333
Upon returning I realized
that I MYSELF am that evil...

741
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:11,541
The very evil I wanted
to free the world from.

742
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:13,083
Albrecht, enough.

743
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:15,833
Killing the captives was wrong.

744
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:19,833
- They weren't armed, as Stein had told  us,
just to bait us.     - Stop it.

745
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:25,833
- We didn't shoot men, but helpless
children.  - LEAVE THIS INSTANT !!!

746
01:24:56,333 --> 01:25:00,000
[ Head of Institution ]

747
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:12,958
How can you explain
your behavior?

748
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:27,250
Do you understand the
position you've put me in?

749
01:25:27,291 --> 01:25:36,916
I don't think you have the slightest
idea of all the privileges you have here.

750
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:46,583
Do you know how much I
would have sacrificed just

751
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:49,500
to be able to graduate
from such a school?

752
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:52,625
But I wasn't granted
such a chance,

753
01:25:52,666 --> 01:25:58,583
by the age of 16, I'd already
been working for 3 whole years.

754
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:02,458
And you..

755
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:05,500
All you do is to trample on everything.

756
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:08,291
But that's over now.

757
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:10,208
You're going to write an essay,

758
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:13,750
in which you'll tell
the 'real' version.

759
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:15,791
And I expect you

760
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:18,416
to voluntarily join the
Waffen SS by yourself.

761
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:21,208
I've already talked
to Borner, brigade leader.

762
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:25,000
Ukraine will suit you
the best, right now.

763
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:27,666
- I can't.
- What?

764
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:30,791
I won't write a new essay.

765
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:36,791
Yesterday, I wrote
what I really thought.

766
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:43,125
I'm to be given that essay
early tomorrow morning,

767
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:52,083
or else you won't survive this.

768
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:06,083
Alright, get out. End of jail.

769
01:27:08,916 --> 01:27:11,541
- What's going on?
- Haven't you heard?

770
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:14,250
Albrecht defamed his
father in an essay.

771
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:16,333
What ??

772
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:34,041
Albrecht !

773
01:27:37,291 --> 01:27:39,875
What's happened?

774
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:46,083
I'll be 17 in one week.

775
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:49,875
My father's shipping me off
to the Eastern front.

776
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:55,083
I'm to write another essay
to straighten things out.

777
01:27:55,125 --> 01:27:59,416
So why did you write that essay?

778
01:27:59,458 --> 01:28:01,250
I couldn't have done it any other way.

779
01:28:01,291 --> 01:28:03,666
What do you mean:
I couldn't...?

780
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:07,000
Yes, you couldn't neither...

781
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:09,250
when you punched the coach.

782
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:13,333
- That was something completely different.
- Oh, really?

783
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:17,083
- You didn't help anyone by doing so !
- Yes, I did.

784
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:22,250
So who'd you help? Explain it
to me. I can't understand it !

785
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:26,208
I helped myself...

786
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:28,333
Oh, really?
You helped yourself??

787
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:33,541
You didn't think about
anyone else, did you?

788
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:39,291
He ?! Say something !! He ?!

789
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:45,875
You fucking egoist !!

790
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:28,000
That's the first essay of mine
my father has ever read...

791
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:32,833
So what are you going to do now?

792
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:36,208
I don't know.

793
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:56,708
Get up ! In 10 minutes I want
to see everybody at the lake !

794
01:29:58,916 --> 01:30:02,375
When I say "in 10 minutes",

795
01:30:02,416 --> 01:30:06,625
then you ARE to be at the lake
in 10 minutes. Is that clear??

796
01:30:06,666 --> 01:30:07,708
Okay.

797
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:11,708
You'll enter this air hole here,

798
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:15,833
then, swim (underwater)
to the second one.

799
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:21,166
Whoever's ready... goes to wash
himself, then, it's on to breakfast.

800
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:23,083
Christoph, you're the first.

801
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:27,791
Well, c'mon, it's not getting
any warmer here !

802
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:03,208
Christian and Peter,
go to the second air hole.

803
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:47,166
Ok, it's back to your room. Hup !

804
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:52,333
Friedrich, you're next. Come !

805
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:19,833
Albrecht, your turn.

806
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:08,625
Tjaden, next.

807
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:53,541
Albrecht. Albrecht !!

808
01:33:56,291 --> 01:34:01,958
Albrecht, no !
NO !

809
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:14,625
Too weak...

810
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:20,291
He was simply too weak...

811
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:19,208
Obituary.

812
01:38:21,083 --> 01:38:22,750
Please !

813
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,458
Friedrich,

814
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:34,208
good to see you up.

815
01:38:38,625 --> 01:38:45,791
I'd like to have this printed
in the upcoming issue.

816
01:38:45,791 --> 01:38:47,500
[ Obituary ]

817
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,916
No.

818
01:38:50,083 --> 01:38:51,666
But,

819
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:55,000
then... they can't
yet bury him.

820
01:38:55,041 --> 01:39:00,000
- You can't do that...
- Amidst people who have died for Fuhrer,

821
01:39:00,041 --> 01:39:03,833
for motherland, and for the nation:
there's no place for suicides.

822
01:39:03,875 --> 01:39:06,083
His parents think the same way.

823
01:39:06,125 --> 01:39:08,083
They've seriously asked me

824
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:12,875
if I've forgiven you for the fact that
you're partly responsible for his death...

825
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:14,875
Both strongly feel that

826
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:18,375
their son changed greatly
since meeting you...

827
01:39:18,416 --> 01:39:21,708
But I defended you.

828
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:25,541
Don't worry. I know how
much that Saturday fight,

829
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:27,750
in the name of our
school, means to you.

830
01:39:27,791 --> 01:39:29,583
Strong proof of your faith

831
01:39:29,625 --> 01:39:33,791
in your tutors. And your
gratitude for the chance

832
01:39:33,833 --> 01:39:36,916
that you were given here.

833
01:39:36,958 --> 01:39:41,000
Thank you.
You may leave now.

834
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:55,875
How are you doing?

835
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:09,708
Friedrich, what happened back
there in the forest was terrible...

836
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:14,333
And Albrecht's
death is a severe loss.

837
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:18,083
But right now, it's all about
your life..., your future...

838
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:26,833
There are scouts from various
sport schools in the audience.

839
01:40:26,875 --> 01:40:32,083
Use this fact well.

840
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,958
Is everything alright?

841
01:40:42,666 --> 01:40:44,000
Make him cry !

You know the rules.

843
01:40:55,166 --> 01:41:00,166
No punches below the waist,
no head butting. Fight fairly.

844
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:02,041
Now to
your corners.

The underwear is also ours.

852

Dismissed.

Let's go, forward march !

855
01:47:51,291 --> 01:47:55,500
Up until 1945, there were
over 40 Nazi educational

856
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:58,791
outposts, with more
than 15,000 students,

857
01:47:58,833 --> 01:48:04,833
all within the territory
of the German Reich.

858

When the war was finally
acknowledged as being lost,

859
01:48:08,375 --> 01:48:11,833
they were still sent out
for the:   "Last Struggle"

860
01:48:11,875 --> 01:48:21,166
Blinded by instructed fanaticism and
despite being insufficiently armed,

861
01:48:21,208 --> 01:48:27,000
they offered a stubborn resistance.

862
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:42,541
Half of them died...
