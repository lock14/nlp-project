because I was
too busy running.

She couldn't have looked
like my mother

is very fat.

I wouldn't be able
to get into Heaven.

Take this, weirdo twerp!

77
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,786
Fall out!

78
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:50,879
Nun: Ten-hut!

Chins up, shoulders back,
and...

81
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:05,351

is where I am...

We love

87
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:19,949
Catholic school
is where I am.

88
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,245
Catholic school
will make me a man.

89
00:04:24,245 --> 00:04:27,874
Father, Son
and Holy Ghost.

90
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:31,419
We love St. Anthony
the most...

91
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:02,075
Mother Superior:
Mr. Battaglia...

92
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,952
you know if you were
more normal,

93
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:07,080
we wouldn't have to go
through this so often.

94
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,124
Why can't you act like
all the other little boys?

95
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:11,251
Huh?

96
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:15,964
Then you wouldn't have
so many enemies.

97
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:19,175
You might make
some friends.

98
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:20,343
So here we are,

99
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:23,346
once again faced with
the unsavory prospect

100
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:26,808
of having to call
your mother.

101
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:29,519
I don't like calling
your mother, Bruno.

102
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,396
To tell you the truth,

103
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:34,941
I don't really like
your mother.

104
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:39,821
Why do the two of you
always insist

105
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:44,617
on inspiring such
heartfelt disdain?

106
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:51,207
Can I use the bathroom?

107
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:56,004
All right.

108
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:57,672
Consolata!

109
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,466
Yes?

110
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:01,843
Have you finished
typing up the memos

111
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:03,595
for the other sisters
regarding the spelling bee?

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,762
I'm almost done.

113
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:08,391
Type faster.
And get Bruno a hall pass.

114
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:10,185
And when Mrs. Battaglia
gets here,

115
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:12,145
I don't want her
within 50 feet of my office!

116
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,022
This time I mean it!

117
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:16,107
Consolata: But I can't
stop her from...

118
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:18,735
- Understand?
- But...

119
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:21,321
That'll be all, sister!

120
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:22,780
Come on.

121
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:31,456
Shut the door
on your way out, sister.

122
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,167
Oh, Poppy, Poppy.

123
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,753
You're the Pope.

124
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:40,423
You're the top banana...

125
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:42,091
La da da.

126
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:47,722
Da da da da da da...

127
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,903
Bruno: Sometimes when
I closed my eyes,

128
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,072
I could pretend
I was in Heaven.

129
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:05,949
I could pretend
I was with two angels,

130
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:07,825
and they were my parents.

131
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:10,870
We held hands,
we laughed and had fun.

132
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,624
But then the father angel
let go.

133
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:16,709
Why did he go, Mom?

134
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,461
Mom?

135
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:20,129
Mom!

136
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:22,966
Woman: Bruno, where are you?

137
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:25,552
Come on, baby,
let's go.

138
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:30,348
Mommy's got bingo tonight,
come on.

139
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:49,742
Sister?

140
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:52,036
- What's wrong, Bruno?
- I don't know.

141
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,038
- Where's your mother?
- I don't know.

142
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:55,999
Did everything come out
all right?

143
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:57,375
- No.
- It didn't?

144
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,335
- No.
- Well, what's the matter?

145
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,337
It's all plugged up
and cloistered.

146
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:03,298
Consolata: Oh, my God, where?
Show me.

147
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:05,383
Here and here.

148
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:07,468
My God, you've gotta
see the nurse.

149
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:12,682
Don't move,
I'll get the pass.

150
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:25,737
You can't go in there!

151
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:30,200
Angela, if you threaten
me again,

152
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,868
I'm calling the police.

153
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:35,121
Then do something more about
those kids picking on my son.

154
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:37,290
I'm sorry, but I've done
everything I can.

155
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,292
If Bruno wants people
to stop picking on him,

156
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,794
he's gonna have to take matters
into his own hands!

157
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:43,880
How is he supposed
to do that?

158
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,300
By not acting like
such a little sissy!

159
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,553
How could you be
so friggin' heartless?

160
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:53,765
I'm not heartless,
I'm a Catholic nun!

161
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:56,809
You don't have
a Catholic bone

162
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:59,521
- in your goddamned body.
- Is that a threat?

163
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,814
You're friggin' right,
it's a threat.

164
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:02,941
That's it.
I'm calling the cops.

165
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:05,443
If I were you, I'd do more
than call the cops.

166
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:07,862
I'd get on this big,
black phone of yours,

167
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:11,282
and I'd call the Pope!

168
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:12,116
Ta-ta.

169
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:20,458
Angela: Let's go.

170
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,252
Girl: Bye.

171
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:33,388
Girl: Here she comes.

172
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:40,395
Boy: She's so fat.

173
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,480
Bruno: Sometimes I prayed
for a good angel

174
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,649
to come
and take me away.

175
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,237
But no matter how hard
I prayed, it never happened.

176
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:53,741
Boy: Hey, Bruno,
are you a pussy?

177
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:00,498
- Boys: Pussy, pussy...
- Is that your mother?

178
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:01,875
She looks like a house.

179
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,418
Come on, Mom.

180
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:04,878
"Come on, Mom. "

181
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,880
- Please.
- Ignore them.

182
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,423
Boys:
"Please. Ignore them. "

183
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:09,883
Little minds, little bodies.

184
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:14,262
Boys:
"Little minds, little bodies. "

185
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:22,520
- Let's go, Mom.
- Look at her waddle.

186
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,651
Let's watch the car tilt.

187
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:33,364
Let's see if it can move
with all that weight in it.

188
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:37,327
Let's watch the ties pop.

189
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:44,000
She's going backwards!
The fat fuck can't even drive.

190
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:49,839
Holy shit, run!

191
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:54,219
Run!
Get out of the way!

192
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:04,020
Boy: Shit,
that fat lady is crazy.

193
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:08,483
Boy:
Wait till tomorrow, Bruno!

194
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,618
So, how was school today?

195
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:19,869
Fine.

196
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:38,429
Let's go find some beauty.

197
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:40,098
Okay.

198
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:45,186
Woman: Coronation Pink.

199
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:47,897
It just came in today.

200
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:50,316
What do you say, Ange,
you want to give it a shot?

201
00:11:50,316 --> 00:11:51,150
Okay.

202
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:57,198
Woman: Oh, my God,
that is so you.

203
00:11:57,198 --> 00:12:00,535
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

204
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:01,578
So,

205
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,538
how's the dress business
treating you?

206
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:06,583
I've got three due by Friday.
I haven't started one.

207
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,668
Really?
Oh, look...

208
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:12,088
we have lipstick too,
that matches. Coronation Pink.

209
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:15,133
Look at this.
Isn't it a beautiful color?

210
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,927
And it comes in a nice,
gold tone compact

211
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:21,598
that's all faceted.
I just love facets, don't you?

212
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:23,558
And we have
matching nail polish.

213
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:25,143
Give me your hand.

214
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:27,645
Oh, no, I don't want
to ruin your manicure.

215
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:28,980
Don't want to ruin
mine, either.

216
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,484
Here, kid.
How about it?

217
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:35,445
Guess who came in
this morning?

218
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,487
Who?

219
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,156
A certain tramp...

220
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:41,492
who happens to be dating
your ex-husband.

221
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:44,829
- H mmm. She buy anything?
- She sure did.

222
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:46,080
What'd she get?

223
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,291
Nail polish.

224
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,251
What color?

225
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:56,007
Coronation Pink.

226
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:59,761
- What else?
- A little blush.

227
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:03,306
- What color?
- Coronation Pink.

228
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:06,017
She bought the polish,
she bought the blush,

229
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:08,603
and she bought
the lipstick.

230
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:11,439
- I'll take two of everything.
- It's too overpowering.

231
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:12,690
What the hell
you talking about?

232
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,401
That ain't overpowering.

233
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:16,861
Let's go.

234
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,321
- So soon?
- Yeah.

235
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:20,615
Woman: What's going on?
Where are you going?

236
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:22,158
Where are you going?

237
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:24,452
What about the blush
and the polish?

238
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:26,746
Angela:
Charge it to the tramp.

239
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:29,040
Waiter:
Hello, can I help you?

240
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,668
Five double burgers,
with cheese and bacon, rare...

241
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:34,170
Waiter: Excuse me, ma'am,
could you repeat that louder?

242
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,548
Five double burgers, rare,
with cheese and bacon...

243
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:39,259
- Louder.
- Five double burgers...

244
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,303
rare, with cheese and bacon!
Six clam strips,

245
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:45,723
lots of tartar sauce!
Three large fries, well done,

246
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:49,060
extra ketchup and two orders
of mozzarella sticks!

247
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:51,271
- What do you want?
- I'm not hungry.

248
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,439
You should eat before
you go to hockey practice.

249
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:55,859
I don't want to go
to hockey practice.

250
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:56,776
You have to go.

251
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,778
Your father's department
is the team sponsor.

252
00:13:58,778 --> 00:13:59,904
But I'm not any good.

253
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,489
That's because
you never eat.

254
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,157
I'm not hungry.

255
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:06,077
Waiter: Excuse me, ma'am,
are you finished?

256
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:09,205
Also, four extra crispy
apple pies,

257
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:11,374
a la mode, warmed,

258
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,585
and a large diet coke.

259
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:17,755
That'll do.

260
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:24,929
Waiter: That'll be $37.50.
Please drive around.

261
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,432
Thank you
for your order.

262
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:29,517
Boy:
Pass the puck around!

263
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:31,603
Coach:
Where's our goalie?

264
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:32,979
Where's Battaglia?

265
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:37,233
- You missed it!
- I'm open!

266
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:39,235
When you mention me
to your father,

267
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:41,321
I want you to study
the expression on his face

268
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:44,032
and memorize every detail
and report it back to me.

269
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:46,117
But he doesn't
make an expression.

270
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:49,662
Look closer, it's subtle.

271
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:52,248
Wish me luck, even though
I'm gonna win tonight.

272
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:53,291
Good luck.

273
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:57,378
You, too.
Bye, baby.

274
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:58,838
Bye.

275
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:14,687
- Coach: Capricci?
- Here.

276
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,022
- Mazzaratti?
- Yo!

277
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:17,398
- Ferguson?
- Here.

278
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:18,650
- Mallory?
- Here.

279
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:19,776
- Buchanski?
- Here.

280
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:21,152
- Landy?
- Here!

281
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,278
- Honeywell?
- Here!

282
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:25,198
- Battaglia? Battaglia!
- Mazzaratti: Hurry up!

283
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,577
- Here.
- Come on, Bruno.

284
00:15:46,052 --> 00:15:51,057
Bruno: Oof!

285
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:57,021
Mazzaratti:
You're such a dork!

286
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:58,064
Oops!

287
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:05,029
G-9-6... no, G-6-9.

288
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,115
Woman:
She's half in the bag.

289
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:12,537
Oh... goddamn it!

290
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:13,913
I-19.

291
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,585
O-65.

292
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,340
O-99.

293
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:26,634
No, O-66.

294
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:46,863
B-15!

295
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:53,411
B-6.

296
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,461
Hey, Donna Marie.

297
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:03,421
Ugh...

298
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:08,343
Oh, Christ.

299
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:12,805
Keep an eye on her.
I don't want any trouble.

300
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:16,684
Donna, in case she doesn't
hear when I yell "Bingo,"

301
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:18,436
I brought my lucky bell.

302
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:22,815
Let's hear it.

303
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:30,240
Is that bell legal?

304
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,576
Caller: N-32.

305
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,579
That bitch is wearing
Coronation Pink!

306
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:39,082
I can't belie v e your son
was married to that.

307
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:40,875
Yeah, well, I got him now.

308
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,752
A lot of people
have had him.

309
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:44,420
I don't think
that bell is legal.

310
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:47,632
There are no cowbells
allowed in the bingo hall.

311
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:49,217
What about her?
She's got a bell.

312
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:51,386
The only one I see
is the one you're holding.

313
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:53,388
I'm surprised she ain't
wearing it around her neck.

314
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:55,682
Another crack like that,
I'll use it to wring your neck.

315
00:17:55,765 --> 00:17:57,976
All right, that's enough!
Come on, give me the bell.

316
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,893
No.

317
00:17:58,893 --> 00:18:00,770
- Angela!
- No!

318
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:03,898
She's just jealous because
Dino left her for me.

319
00:18:03,898 --> 00:18:06,109
Dino did not leave me
for that tramp.

320
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:09,028
- Oh, yes, he did!
- He was always messing around.

321
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:11,948
Who would want to be married
to a fat cow like you

322
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:14,868
when he could marry
a body like this?

323
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:16,828
- Whore.
- Stop it.

324
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:18,913
- Donna: Elephant.
- That's enough!

325
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:20,373
- Bitch.
- I mean it!

326
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:21,958
- Tank.
- Step aside.

327
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,084
Mother of God.

328
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:23,835
U h-oh.

329
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,086
Mother Superior:
Angela...

330
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,754
Oh, my God,
she's gonna kill me!

331
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:29,757
Woman: Bingo!

332
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:32,802
Coach:
Block it!

333
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:46,024
- You think he's dead?
- I don't know, kick him.

334
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:50,528
Boy: Did the puck hit him
in the head, or something?

335
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:55,742
Superior: I think
you'd better leave now.

336
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:57,410
But she fainted
before I got to her!

337
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,081
Just take your cowbell
and go!

338
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:06,794
Mrs. Battaglia: Donna!
Wake up!

339
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,637
Angela:
Sit down, show's over.

340
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:22,727
Donna, wake up.
Oh...!

341
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:27,106
I'm gonna kill her.

342
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:31,611
Bruno:
Bye, you guys. Oof!

343
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:35,573
Boy: See you later,
brainiac.

344
00:19:54,968 --> 00:20:00,390
I'm sorry I fell again.

345
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:12,360
Hi, baby.
How was hockey practice?

346
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,820
Fine.

347
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:15,405
Are you going
to help me tonight?

348
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:16,739
Nope.

349
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,320
Hello.

350
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:03,870
Did Bruno
block any goals?

351
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,540
No, he didn't
block any goals.

352
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,960
What'd he do?

353
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:14,297
I'd rather talk about
what you did today.

354
00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:15,757
What do you mean?

355
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:19,636
You know damn well
what I mean.

356
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:22,972
She started it.

357
00:21:22,972 --> 00:21:26,518
I'm not talking about
your little...

358
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:31,397
fight with Donna Marie.

359
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:33,691
"At approximately 2:30
this afternoon

360
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:37,153
a 1970 yellow
Cadillac convertible

361
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:40,156
tried to mow down
a bunch of kids...

362
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:42,575
in front of St. Anthony's
Catholic Grammar School. "

363
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:45,787
That wasn't me.

364
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:48,915
"Pink interior,

365
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:51,626
peacock feather
down the side,

366
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:54,963
license plate, 'D-I-V-A.'"

367
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:58,299
- It was an accident.
- Cut the crap, Angela.

368
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:01,344
What is in your brain?
What are you thinking?

369
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:04,347
Why do you constantly
humiliate and embarrass me?

370
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:06,432
Angela: You're always thinking
of yourself.

371
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:07,809
What about us for a change?

372
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:10,520
I don't want Bruno anywhere near
that hockey arena anymore.

373
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,897
And if you...
if you go within

374
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:16,359
a two-mile radius
of that school,

375
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,405
I will personally
arrest you.

376
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,576
But we didn't hit anybody.

377
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,709
What is that?

378
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:35,837
- What?
- What he's got on.

379
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:38,131
It's a night shirt.

380
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:41,050
No, it's not.
It's a dress.

381
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:43,887
Angela: It's a nightgown.

382
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:45,555
What's he doing
in a nightgown?

383
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:48,349
Going to sleep.

384
00:22:48,474 --> 00:22:50,351
Dino: I thought we said
no more of that stuff.

385
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,312
Angela: You said no more
of that stuff.

386
00:22:52,312 --> 00:22:55,982
What kind of little boy
goes to bed in a nightgown?

387
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:59,736
One who plays hockey.

388
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:03,489
He doesn't play hockey.

389
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:09,204
Dino: And he's not gonna
play anymore.

390
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,289
- Why not?
- Because he stinks!

391
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:13,291
- He'll get better!
- No, he won't.

392
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,503
- How can you say that?
- He'll never get better!

393
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:19,631
Angela: If you were more
of a father and a husband...

394
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:22,133
Dino: I'm not your husband
any more, goddamn it!

395
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,593
I wish I never was!

396
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:26,846
- You didn't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

397
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,097
Look at you, Angela,

398
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:29,974
Look at what you've
let yourself become,

399
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:31,726
you're 450 pounds,

400
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:34,229
and your little boy
is sleeping in a dress.

401
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:37,565
How do you expect me
to feel?

402
00:23:37,565 --> 00:23:41,736
I am through
being embarrassed

403
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:45,907
and humiliated
by the both of you.

404
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,346
Bruno: I was taught we were all
born with original sin,

405
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,349
and may never achieve
forgiveness.

406
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:17,105
I wondered what
my sin was.

407
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,997
What book are we
gonna read tonight?

408
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:36,791
I don't wanna read.

409
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,419
How about a couple
of pages from the dictionary?

410
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,588
No, thank you.

411
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:43,256
It's Random House,
unabridged.

412
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,133
No.

413
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,471
Don't you want to prepare
for the spelling bee?

414
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:54,309
I'm prepared.

415
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:59,856
Maybe we should get you
some pajamas.

416
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,193
Fine.

417
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:09,324
I think I'm gonna start
my diet tomorrow.

418
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:14,120
- Do you think I should?
- Yes.

419
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,788
He used to read to us...

420
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:17,457
poetry.

421
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:19,334
And he used to sing opera.

422
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:21,336
He sang us to sleep,
do you remember?

423
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:22,587
No.

424
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:31,554
Good night, baby.

425
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:35,808
Good night.

426
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:41,356
Sweet dreams, baby.

427
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:51,212
Bruno: Sometimes what you wear
can bring God closer to you.

428
00:28:55,717 --> 00:28:59,679
But sometimes
what you want to wear

429
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,393
can separate you
from people.

430
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:15,195
Girl: Move it.
Watch out.

431
00:29:15,195 --> 00:29:18,448
Boy: Don't push.

432
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:20,408
Girl: Hey, remember me?

433
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:23,328
My name is Shawniqua Van Adams.
What's your name?

434
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,370
Bruno.

435
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:26,372
I'm new here, Bruno.
Do you want to be my friend?

436
00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:29,083
Hey, I said, do you want
to be my friend?

437
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:33,463
What are you looking at?

438
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:36,049
What are the nuns
like here, anyway?

439
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,676
Are any of them black?

440
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,054
- Get him!
- Hurry up!

441
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,348
Shawniqua:
What are you doing?

442
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,767
Stop it!

443
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:48,144
Hey!

444
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:50,021
Stop!

445
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:59,531
Shawniqua: Stop it!
Let him go!

446
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,951
Boy: Open the window.

447
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:05,870
Boy: What are you
going to do now, Battaglia,

448
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:08,790
without your fat ass mother
here to protect you?

449
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,417
We're really
gonna drop you now.

450
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:13,503
Boy:
Do it!

451
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:15,797
Shawniqua:
What are you doing?

452
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:17,966
Let's drop
the little geek.

453
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:20,051
- Here she comes!
- Guys, guys!

454
00:30:20,176 --> 00:30:22,345
Hey!
What is going on?

455
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:26,641
Boy: Holy crap,
it's Sister Drink A Lot!

456
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,184
Unh...!

457
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,272
He was hanging out
the window.

458
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:34,440
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were!

459
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,317
That kid was hanging him.

460
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:38,403
- No, he wasn't.
- Yes, he was!

461
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:40,405
I'm gonna put you
on punishment.

462
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,699
That's plenty.
That's enough from everyone.

463
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:47,287
Bruno, take your seat.

464
00:30:58,006 --> 00:31:04,179
Nun: Okay, Mazzaratti,
you know the drill.

465
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:07,515
And you, young lady...

466
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:09,601
I know you're new here
at St. Anthony's

467
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,561
and it might have been
permitted at your old school,

468
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:14,272
but here, we do not play
"Cowboys and Indians"

469
00:31:14,397 --> 00:31:16,149
in the classroom.
Give me the guns.

470
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,609
No!

471
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,779
What did you say to me?

472
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,573
I said, no.

473
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:25,658
Nun: If you do not
give me those guns,

474
00:31:25,658 --> 00:31:27,535
you will have to sit
in the corner

475
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,038
for the rest of the day,
facing the wall.

476
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:32,415
And you will not be able
to participate

477
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,377
in the spelling bee.

478
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:39,923
Good.
I hate spellin'.

479
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:42,342
Nun: First of all,
it's not "spellin'."

480
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:43,885
It has a "g"
on the end of it.

481
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:45,553
It's not "spellin',"
it's spelling.

482
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:47,013
"I hate spelling. "

483
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:50,266
Well, I ain't spell-ing
'caus e I ain't giving you my guns.

484
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:56,731
A- I-N-T, ain't.

485
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,651
Give me the guns.

486
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,570
I said, no.

487
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,907
If you do not
give me those guns,

488
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:09,118
you are going to be
very, very sorry.

489
00:32:09,118 --> 00:32:10,370
Phew!

490
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:16,751
Not as sorry as you look.

491
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,002
O- kay.

492
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,568
Consolata!

493
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,447
Bruno: In the beginning,
there was the Word

494
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:48,241
and the Word was God.

495
00:32:48,241 --> 00:32:50,743
I used to believe that
if I knew all the words,

496
00:32:50,743 --> 00:32:53,121
I could talk to God,
and God could talk to me.

497
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:54,706
But the more words I learned,

498
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,083
the further away from God
I seemed to get.

499
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:01,045
Predacious.
P- R-E-

500
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:02,714
D- A-S-

501
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,425
I- O-U-S.
Predacious.

502
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:08,052
That is incorrect.

503
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,430
Bruno, it's your turn.

504
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:16,686
The word, once again,
"predacious. "

505
00:33:18,354 --> 00:33:20,565
Predacious.

506
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:22,650
P- R-E-D-A-

507
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,611
C- I-O-U-S.

508
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:30,033
- Predacious.
- That is correct.

509
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:32,452
Patricia, it's your turn.

510
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:34,204
Your word is "apocalypse,"

511
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:37,248
as in Francis
Ford Coppola's

512
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,168
"Apocalypse Now. "
Apocalypse.

513
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,711
Shawniqua: Ha ha ha ha!

514
00:33:41,711 --> 00:33:46,090
You ain't never
gonna catch me!

515
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:49,636
Apocalypse.

516
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,638
A- P-P-

517
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:53,515
O- C-

518
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:57,894
Shawniqua:
Hey! Hey, stop!

519
00:33:57,894 --> 00:33:58,937
Knock it off.

520
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:03,399
I told you so.
Keep your hands up.

521
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:06,945
L- Y-P-S-E.
Apocalypse.

522
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,449
That is incorrect.

523
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,618
Shawniqua: Don't mess with me.
I mean it.

524
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,495
Move it!

525
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:36,474
Bruno: Sometimes on Earth
you can find something

526
00:34:36,558 --> 00:34:39,060
that resembles
a little piece of Heaven.

527
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,728
And sometimes, on Earth,

528
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:44,190
a little piece of Heaven
can find you.

529
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,359
Hi, Bruno,
remember me?

530
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,027
Yeah.

531
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:50,238
Did you eat
your lunch up there?

532
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:51,281
Yeah.

533
00:34:51,281 --> 00:34:54,617
- Guess where I ate mine?
- Mother Superior's office.

534
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:57,829
Hey, that's right.
She took my hat...

535
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,957
but I hid my guns
under my skirt.

536
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:03,459
Do you like guns?

537
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:05,128
No.

538
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:09,716
How'd the spelling bee go?

539
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,176
Fine. I won.

540
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,304
I knew it.
I knew you were smart

541
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,348
the minute
I laid eyes on you.

542
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,434
Hey,
where are you going?

543
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,979
Bruno, do you want to walk
a dog with me after school?

544
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:25,148
No.

545
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:29,652
Don't you want to be
my friend?

546
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:32,155
- No, I don't.
- Why?

547
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:33,406
Because you're too flamboyant.

548
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:36,743
I don't want another
flamboyant woman in my life.

549
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:40,079
- I'm just expressing myself.
- Do it someplace else.

550
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,082
What are you doing,
you little faggot?

551
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:46,127
Goddamn it, I'm gonna
have to kill you.

552
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:49,464
Leave him alone!

553
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:52,592
Back off, nigger.

554
00:35:52,675 --> 00:35:56,638
- Don't call her a nigger.
- What'd you say to me, faggot?

555
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:59,974
- Don't call her a nigger!
- You're dead, Ba-fag-lia.

556
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:02,477
There's a fight over here.

557
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:05,104
- Faggot.
- Drop him, Eddie!

558
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,193
Boy: Hit him
where it hurts, Eddie.

559
00:36:13,947 --> 00:36:15,823
Cut it out!
Get off.

560
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:18,034
I mean it!

561
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:22,080
- Nun: Fall in!
- It's the Sarge!

562
00:36:22,205 --> 00:36:24,791
Boy: Go home,
you stupid weirdo.

563
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:29,295
Mr. Battaglia.

564
00:36:29,379 --> 00:36:33,675
Here we are once again.
And Miss Van Adams.

565
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:39,931
Why doesn't this surprise me?

566
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,059
Didn't they teach you
where you came from

567
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:45,436
never to pick on kids
weaker than yourself?

568
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,438
I wasn't picking on him!

569
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,898
Oh, no?

570
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:50,233
Then what were you doing
on top of him?

571
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:52,026
I was protecting him!

572
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:54,195
Superior: You expect me
to believe that?

573
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,197
Why not?

574
00:37:00,994 --> 00:37:03,371
What do you have to say
about this, young man?

575
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:05,039
Okay.

576
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:07,750
Okay, what?

577
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,463
Okay, I'll be your friend.

578
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,976
Oh, God.

579
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:29,647
Bruno:
Daddy pine cone!

580
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:32,483
Another dad pine cone.

581
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,612
- Do you like Diana Ross?
- I like Maria Callas.

582
00:37:35,612 --> 00:37:37,363
Yeah, she's nice,
but when I move

583
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,365
to be a cowboy,
I'm taking Diana with me.

584
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:44,370
- You can come, too.
- Okay. I'll bring Maria.

585
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,247
Shawniqua:
Hey, do you sing?

586
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:47,999
Bruno:
No, but my dad used to.

587
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:50,084
He did?

588
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:55,215
- But he doesn't sing anymore.
- That's too bad.

589
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:57,592
Bruno: Do you think the tops
of the trees touch Heaven?

590
00:37:57,717 --> 00:38:00,011
Shawniqua: I don't know,
I've never been up that high.

591
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,305
Hey, do you smoke?

592
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:04,265
No, do you?

593
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:06,684
No, it's bad for you.

594
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,270
My mom says
it turns your soul black.

595
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:11,481
What's wrong
with a black soul?

596
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:13,358
Nothing.

597
00:38:16,486 --> 00:38:21,366
Oh, I'm cold.

598
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:25,036
Wanna wear my pants?

599
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,956
What?
You mean switch?

600
00:38:27,956 --> 00:38:31,584
Sure, I'll trade you
my pants for your skirt.

601
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:38,591
- Do you want to?
- Okay. Come on.

602
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,682
This is where we're gonna
make the switch.

603
00:38:45,682 --> 00:38:48,810
Do we have to go in here?
Grave yards scare me.

604
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,312
Well, they don't scare me.
Come on, Bruno,

605
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:55,483
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

606
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:58,611
Stick close to me.
I've got you covered.

607
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:01,739
Cowboys are very good
at protecting people,

608
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,908
and I'm the best
cowboy there is.

609
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,702
So don't you worry,
Bruno.

610
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:09,873
Anything jumps out at you,
I'll get 'em.

611
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:13,918
And besides,
dead people can't hurt you.

612
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:16,337
After they die
they be come angels,

613
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:17,589
and angels are nice.

614
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:20,175
- Not all of them.
- How do you know?

615
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,260
Have you ever seen one?

616
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,303
Yeah.

617
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,971
You have?

618
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,556
Yeah, lots of them.

619
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:28,433
Are any of the angels black?

620
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:29,475
What?

621
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:34,898
Are any of the angels black?

622
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:36,024
I knew it.

623
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,528
Hey, look.
That's where we're gonna change.

624
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:41,654
No, not in there.

625
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,531
Come on.

626
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:45,533
Shawniqua: I hate dresses,

627
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:48,119
except for my Communion dress,
and that's holy.

628
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,121
- A holy dress?
- Mm-hmm.

629
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:53,458
I have dreams about holy dresses.
Angels wear them.

630
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:54,792
Shawniqua:
Those are holy vestments.

631
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,504
They are?
I have a holy doll.

632
00:39:57,504 --> 00:39:59,589
It's an angel.
My mother made it for me.

633
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:00,965
Shawniqua:
I don't like dolls,

634
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,343
but I wouldn't mind
if it was an angel.

635
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:05,762
Oh, it's freezing in here.
Come on.

636
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:09,182
Now, let's go.

637
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:13,269
Hurry up, we got
a dog to walk.

638
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:14,395
Why?

639
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:17,315
- Gotta make some money.
- I get an allowance

640
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,192
for helping my mom
make dresses.

641
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:20,777
That's how I get
my money.

642
00:40:20,777 --> 00:40:22,111
You do?

643
00:40:22,111 --> 00:40:26,824
Shawniqua:
Mrs. Draco, are you alive?

644
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:27,659
Hello?

645
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,503
Heel, Baby, heel!

646
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,923
About face, Baby!
About face!

647
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:44,008
Bad dog, naughty Baby.

648
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:47,762
No, no, no, no!

649
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,764
What is going on here?

650
00:40:49,764 --> 00:40:51,516
Did you scare my Baby?

651
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,352
No, Baby tried
to scare my friend.

652
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:57,272
Don't be afraid.
Baby is an angel,

653
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:58,815
aren't you, sweetie?

654
00:40:58,815 --> 00:41:01,234
Okay, make sure
you take him

655
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:03,736
past his favorite
fire hydrant.

656
00:41:03,736 --> 00:41:05,697
Off you go.

657
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:06,865
Shawniqua: Come on, Baby.

658
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,616
Bye, girls.

659
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:10,410
Bye.

660
00:41:10,493 --> 00:41:11,744
Shawniqua: Heel, Baby!

661
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,621
You can't show fear.
They smell it,

662
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:16,040
and then they get scared.
That's why he growled.

663
00:41:16,124 --> 00:41:18,543
- He didn't seem very scared.
- Well, he was.

664
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,420
- Here, take the leash.
- No.

665
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,380
If you don't take it,
I'm letting go.

666
00:41:22,505 --> 00:41:27,594
See, if you don't show fear,
you can do anything.

667
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:33,016
Shawniqua: Now tell him
to lift his leg.

668
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:39,814
Come on in.
Now, don't you be scared.

669
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:43,234
Wow!
Is that your mother?

670
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,279
- Yeah.
- How old is she?

671
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:47,530
34.

672
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,576
How's she get so big?

673
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:56,581
- Surplussage.
- What's that?

674
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:58,458
She eats a lot.

675
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:02,337
- What does she eat?
- She's on a diet now.

676
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:04,088
She is?

677
00:42:05,673 --> 00:42:11,596
She's gonna be skinny
real soon.

678
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:32,784
- What's your mom like?
- My mom's dead.

679
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,244
She is?

680
00:42:34,244 --> 00:42:36,621
She died of breast cancer.

681
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:39,457
Her name was Brudell,
she was beautiful.

682
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:42,168
Who takes care of you?
Your dad?

683
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:44,879
No, my dad
lives in China.

684
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:46,756
Who takes care of you?

685
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,925
My brother Henry.

686
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,010
He runs a make up
and hair salon.

687
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,887
He likes Maria Callas, too.

688
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:54,973
- He does?
- U m-hmm.

689
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,140
Close your eyes.

690
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,143
And he owns
a Pontiac Firebird.

691
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,229
It's magenta.

692
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:03,314
Lipstick.

693
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:09,696
Go like this.

694
00:43:09,696 --> 00:43:13,658
Hmmm, fierce.

695
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:18,872
Do you think it's okay
that I wear dresses?

696
00:43:18,872 --> 00:43:21,457
Why not?
I wear pants.

697
00:43:21,457 --> 00:43:23,960
But that's different.

698
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,753
No, it's not.

699
00:43:25,753 --> 00:43:27,714
We're both just
free spirits

700
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:29,591
trying to express
ourselves.

701
00:43:29,716 --> 00:43:31,259
Well,

702
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:34,512
this is very
flamboyant.

703
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:41,186
Shawniqua: I'm a bad angel
disguised as a cowboy!

704
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:50,445
Stay down, Baby!
Stay, Baby!

705
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:55,366
Be a good dog!
Be good!

706
00:43:58,786 --> 00:44:02,874
No!

707
00:44:08,505 --> 00:44:10,381
Medic: Little girl
hit by a car!

708
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,258
She just ran
into the street.

709
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:15,178
Grandmother's on the way.

710
00:44:15,178 --> 00:44:17,138
Woman: I barely had enough time
to hit the brakes!

711
00:44:17,138 --> 00:44:18,097
Doctor: What do you got?

712
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:20,183
Heart rate's 110,
BP 80 over 50, 12 rest.

713
00:44:20,183 --> 00:44:21,851
- Level of consciousness?
- Unconscious.

714
00:44:21,851 --> 00:44:23,394
Okay, let's prepare to move.
On my count...

715
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,231
Ready?
One, two, three, go.

716
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,525
- Thank you very much.
- Very good.

717
00:44:28,525 --> 00:44:30,693
- Blood pressure?
- It's dropping.

718
00:44:30,693 --> 00:44:32,570
Pupils are fixed
and dilated.

719
00:44:32,695 --> 00:44:34,989
We got a concussion.

720
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:36,449
She wearing a wig?
Take this off.

721
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:39,786
Get the dress off, too.

722
00:44:39,786 --> 00:44:42,914
Oh, it's a little boy.

723
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:44,791
Prepare for a C T scan.
Call Radiology.

724
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:46,543
I want a full cervical
and spinal series.

725
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:47,585
Nurse: Right.

726
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:52,715
Make it portable.
Check the oxygen, please.

727
00:44:52,715 --> 00:44:55,635
Why can't you be more normal?

728
00:44:55,635 --> 00:44:58,221
No sissies in Heaven.

729
00:44:58,221 --> 00:45:01,349
- What's going on here?
- Pussy!

730
00:45:01,474 --> 00:45:03,768
...very, very sorry.

731
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:05,854
Hey, Bruno, you pussy.

732
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:12,193
As long as you don't show fear,
you can do anything!

733
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:55,278
Doctor:
Mrs. Battaglia?

734
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:56,404
I'm Dr. Pike.

735
00:45:56,529 --> 00:45:59,032
Oh, my God,
I think I'm gonna faint.

736
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:00,366
- Watch out.
- Ouch!

737
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:03,286
- Oh, sorry.
- How is he?

738
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:04,662
He's gonna be okay.

739
00:46:04,746 --> 00:46:08,833
Oh, thank God.

740
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:12,587
Hey.

741
00:46:12,587 --> 00:46:13,838
What the hell is that?

742
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:16,007
A wig.
Thank God he was wearing it.

743
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:17,675
He was wearing a wig?

744
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,677
We had to discard
the dress.

745
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:24,140
Oh, my God.

746
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,685
Believe it or not, the wig helped
minimize the boy's injury.

747
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:32,899
He just has a mild concussion,
it's nothing serious.

748
00:46:32,899 --> 00:46:34,359
Where is he?
Can I see him?

749
00:46:34,484 --> 00:46:35,818
No, he's resting
right now.

750
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:37,487
We want to keep him
overnight for observation,

751
00:46:37,612 --> 00:46:39,364
but he'll be able
to go home in the morning.

752
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:41,032
If you want to see him
you'll be able to

753
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:42,825
if you don't mind
hanging around for a while.

754
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:44,911
Okay, thank you.

755
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:47,205
Let's get the hell
out of here.

756
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:50,124
Dino, where in the hell
are you going?

757
00:46:50,124 --> 00:46:55,755
- Home.
- Listen to me... Dino!

758
00:48:02,363 --> 00:48:04,032
Mrs. Battaglia?

759
00:48:04,157 --> 00:48:05,700
Is he all right?

760
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,328
You can see
your son now.

761
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:10,413
- Thank you so much.
- Fourth door on the right.

762
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:11,873
Thank you.

763
00:48:32,393 --> 00:48:34,687
Shawniqua:
I'm glad you're okay.

764
00:48:34,687 --> 00:48:38,233
My daddy tanned my hide
real good

765
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:41,694
because you got hit
by that car.

766
00:48:41,903 --> 00:48:47,534
I thought you said
your dad was in China?

767
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:54,290
Give me another word.

768
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,584
Abom-in-able?

769
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,795
Abominable.

770
00:48:58,795 --> 00:49:05,051
A- B-O-M-I-N-A-B-L-E.
Abominable.

771
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:09,222
That is correct.

772
00:49:13,476 --> 00:49:17,564
Did it hurt?

773
00:49:17,647 --> 00:49:19,649
Yes.

774
00:49:19,649 --> 00:49:24,237
It always does.

775
00:49:39,878 --> 00:49:41,337
Hey, Delores.

776
00:49:41,337 --> 00:49:42,797
Hey, kids.

777
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:44,757
Hey, Delores.

778
00:49:44,883 --> 00:49:48,428
Well, if it ain't the little
resurrected accident victim.

779
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:50,513
How was your brush
with death?

780
00:49:50,513 --> 00:49:51,848
Fine.

781
00:49:51,848 --> 00:49:53,433
Why, did you see God?

782
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:54,893
No, but I saw angels.

783
00:49:54,893 --> 00:49:56,978
Did you see
my Auntie Francie?

784
00:49:56,978 --> 00:49:58,313
No.

785
00:49:58,313 --> 00:50:00,607
Should he be walking around?

786
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:03,026
He's fine. He's going back
to school tomorrow,

787
00:50:03,026 --> 00:50:05,111
but I told him he could have
an early Easter present.

788
00:50:05,111 --> 00:50:08,656
Ooh, a present!
For surviving death, huh?

789
00:50:08,656 --> 00:50:11,576
Yeah.

790
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:13,244
What are you
gonna get?

791
00:50:13,328 --> 00:50:14,913
- Pajamas.
- And a dress.

792
00:50:14,996 --> 00:50:16,581
A dress?

793
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:18,333
He can only wear it
in the house

794
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,001
and only
for a little while,

795
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:22,712
because he's getting
to be a big boy.

796
00:50:22,712 --> 00:50:25,131
I know lots of big boys
who wear dresses.

797
00:50:25,215 --> 00:50:27,509
You remember Jose?
He was wearing a dress...

798
00:50:27,634 --> 00:50:28,885
What?

799
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:30,220
Man: Yo, Mr. Mazzaratti,
how ya doin'?

800
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,139
Delores: You remember Jose?
He lived down the street from you...

801
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:34,933
Hold on, Eddie,
hold on.

802
00:50:35,016 --> 00:50:37,101
Delores: Oh, I see.
Jose's colorful,

803
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:40,230
there's nothing wrong with that.
Everybody likes Jose.

804
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:41,814
He's a great guy.
It's okay to wear dresses.

805
00:50:41,898 --> 00:50:43,900
Come on, Dad, let's go.

806
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,777
Delores: Hey, Bruno.

807
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,113
I think this calls for
a little fragrance.

808
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:51,491
- What do you say?
- What is it?

809
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:53,493
Eau de Celeste.

810
00:50:53,493 --> 00:50:56,496
The scent of Heaven.

811
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:57,455
Yeah.

812
00:51:02,043 --> 00:51:06,923
- You like it?
- Yeah.

813
00:51:07,048 --> 00:51:11,094
Come on, Mom,
let's go find some beauty.

814
00:51:11,094 --> 00:51:13,721
- Hey, come on.
- All right.

815
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:16,933
- Yeah, in here.
- You're the boss.

816
00:51:16,933 --> 00:51:19,978
Oh, come on, Mom.

817
00:51:19,978 --> 00:51:23,606
Okay, that should do it.
Call if you need anything.

818
00:51:23,606 --> 00:51:24,649
Okay.

819
00:51:55,638 --> 00:51:57,599
This is the one.

820
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,518
Is this what you saw
in Heaven?

821
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:03,354
Kind of. Almost.
It's the closest.

822
00:52:03,438 --> 00:52:04,189
Good.

823
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:10,320
Cash or charge, Ange?

824
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,448
Charge it to Dino.

825
00:52:13,448 --> 00:52:14,490
Good.

826
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,993
This is going to have to be
a little higher,

827
00:52:16,993 --> 00:52:18,661
maybe about that size.

828
00:52:18,661 --> 00:52:20,663
We're gonna have to
drape it over.

829
00:52:20,663 --> 00:52:22,415
You read my mind
about the shoulder.

830
00:52:22,415 --> 00:52:25,960
- I got the perfect color.
- We have to make this shorter,

831
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,754
and we're going to make it
flow like this,

832
00:52:27,837 --> 00:52:29,297
and we're gonna cut it
on the bias,

833
00:52:29,297 --> 00:52:30,673
because that makes it
flow better.

834
00:52:30,673 --> 00:52:32,008
- Okay.
- That's the whole point,

835
00:52:32,008 --> 00:52:33,384
but I think this is
the wrong fabric.

836
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:34,844
Easy.

837
00:52:34,844 --> 00:52:35,887
I picked it myself.

838
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:38,806
We're going to need
more sequins here.

839
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,141
That's good,
I like that.

840
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:41,392
We're going to have this
like this,

841
00:52:41,518 --> 00:52:43,394
and pull this out,
and pull it over there.

842
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:44,938
It's gonna be
a lot shorter, though.

843
00:52:44,938 --> 00:52:45,980
Okay.

844
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,691
If we take this
and make this part of the wing...

845
00:52:48,691 --> 00:52:50,777
- Wait, hold this like this.
- That's good.

846
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:55,281
Did Delores help you
pick that out?

847
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:40,410
Welcome...

848
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:43,121
to St. Anthony's
58th Annual Spelling Bee.

849
00:53:43,246 --> 00:53:45,957
The winner of this bee
will go on to compete

850
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:48,042
in the regional competition
next month.

851
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:50,003
The winner of the regional
will go on

852
00:53:50,128 --> 00:53:51,171
to the state competition.

853
00:53:51,254 --> 00:53:53,131
The winner of that bee
will go

854
00:53:53,131 --> 00:53:55,341
to the National Catholic
Spelling Championship

855
00:53:55,341 --> 00:53:57,844
in Washington, D C.

856
00:53:57,844 --> 00:54:02,724
the winner of the National
Catholic Spelling Championship

857
00:54:02,724 --> 00:54:05,435
will fly, all expenses paid,

858
00:54:05,435 --> 00:54:08,146
to the Vatican City,
in Rome,

859
00:54:08,146 --> 00:54:10,982
where he, or she,

860
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:13,359
will have a private audience

861
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:20,033
with Pope John Paul II.

862
00:54:21,701 --> 00:54:26,915
So, let's all bow our heads
in a silent prayer

863
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,253
as our little candidates
step onto the stage.

864
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:47,894
Superior: That's enough!

865
00:54:47,894 --> 00:54:51,731
All right,
that's enough.

866
00:54:56,861 --> 00:55:00,823
The next one to make a sound
will be expelled forever.

867
00:55:00,823 --> 00:55:03,826
Expelled from school
and Heaven... forever.

868
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:10,083
Now, will our first contestant
please step up to the mic?

869
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:15,088
Our first word
is "parsimonious. "

870
00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:17,507
As in,
"The Catholic Church

871
00:55:17,507 --> 00:55:21,886
is never parsimonious. "

872
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:26,140
Parsimonious.
P- A-R-

873
00:55:26,266 --> 00:55:28,142
S- I-M-

874
00:55:28,226 --> 00:55:30,103
O- N-

875
00:55:30,103 --> 00:55:33,857
E- U-S.
Parsimonious.

876
00:55:33,857 --> 00:55:37,318
That is incorrect.

877
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:43,449
Will the second contestant
step up to the microphone?

878
00:55:55,879 --> 00:55:57,213
Get him.

879
00:56:21,196 --> 00:56:23,406
What the hell
is he doing in a dress?

880
00:56:23,406 --> 00:56:25,366
Expressing myself.

881
00:56:25,366 --> 00:56:27,368
Besides, it's not a dress,
it's a holy vestment.

882
00:56:27,368 --> 00:56:29,537
Shut up.

883
00:56:29,662 --> 00:56:33,917
No, I will not shut up!

884
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:36,544
I'm going to continue
to express myself!

885
00:56:36,544 --> 00:56:39,464
You say angels help us.
Well, I believe that.

886
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:42,592
They give me power
with my dresses!

887
00:56:42,592 --> 00:56:45,512
Besides, Scotsmen
wear dresses,

888
00:56:45,595 --> 00:56:46,763
they're called kilts.

889
00:56:46,763 --> 00:56:49,349
King Tut wore a skirt
as most men in Egypt did,

890
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:54,062
a skirt of tufted wool.

891
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:56,439
The Dalai Lama wears
robe dresses,

892
00:56:56,439 --> 00:56:58,650
as have all
of his predecessors.

893
00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:01,861
Greek charioteers
wore short paneled skirts.

894
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:03,947
The Siamese kings
wore dresses.

895
00:57:04,072 --> 00:57:07,408
The Chinese Emperor Yao
wore a Pau styled robe,

896
00:57:07,492 --> 00:57:10,537
much like the kimono,
but more flared out at the bottom.

897
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,830
Now...

898
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,082
this was also worn...

899
00:57:14,082 --> 00:57:17,627
by high ranking women,
with fringes at the bottom!

900
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,630
- That'd be good for you, Mom.
- Easy.

901
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,507
Muslim men wear dresses.

902
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:24,926
H ungarian cowboys
wear dresses.

903
00:57:24,926 --> 00:57:27,303
Men in Africa wear dresses.

904
00:57:27,303 --> 00:57:31,391
Angels wear dresses.
Even the Pope wears a dress.

905
00:57:31,474 --> 00:57:33,685
All great masters
wear dresses.

906
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:37,105
Are you going
to call up the Pope

907
00:57:37,105 --> 00:57:41,693
and tell him
not to wear his dress?

908
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:46,281
He's right,
the Pope does wear a dress.

909
00:57:46,406 --> 00:57:50,368
You're pathetic.
Both of you.

910
00:57:50,368 --> 00:57:54,622
Go sit down.

911
00:57:54,831 --> 00:57:57,667
I us ed to think Dino left you
for that tramp, Donna Marie,

912
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,961
because you got fat.
But you're more than fat,

913
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:02,338
you're insane.
You're both insane!

914
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:05,175
Dino did not leave me
for that tramp.

915
00:58:05,175 --> 00:58:07,886
- Oh, yes, he did!
- He still loves me.

916
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:11,723
No, he doesn't!
They're engaged.

917
00:58:11,848 --> 00:58:14,225
And nobody loves you, Angela.
Nobody!

918
00:58:14,225 --> 00:58:15,185
Now...

919
00:58:16,644 --> 00:58:19,772
...when you go
to the regionals,

920
00:58:19,856 --> 00:58:22,358
you're going in a suit and tie.
Have I made myself clear?

921
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:26,112
- He's engaged?
- I'm going to the regionals?

922
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:27,572
You're going
all the way to the Pope.

923
00:58:27,697 --> 00:58:28,948
If you try and do it
in a dress,

924
00:58:29,032 --> 00:58:33,953
I'll rip it off
your sweet little ass myself.

925
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:48,134
Bruno: Come on, Mom.

926
00:58:59,896 --> 00:59:05,443
- Did you hear that?
- Let's go, Mom.

927
00:59:05,527 --> 00:59:07,612
- Gotcha!
- Happy Easter, homo!

928
00:59:07,737 --> 00:59:09,822
- Come on, Mom.
- Bull's-eye!

929
00:59:09,906 --> 00:59:11,991
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

930
00:59:11,991 --> 00:59:15,245
Get in the car.

931
00:59:15,245 --> 00:59:16,996
Oh, no!

932
00:59:18,456 --> 00:59:22,544
Bruno: Run faster, Mom.

933
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:27,966
Come on, Mom,
they're throwing eggs.

934
00:59:31,177 --> 00:59:32,762
Bitch, come on out!

935
00:59:32,762 --> 00:59:34,931
Come on, Mom,
you just got to start the car.

936
00:59:35,056 --> 00:59:38,810
You fat bitch!

937
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,478
Come on, you fat pig.

938
00:59:40,478 --> 00:59:42,021
Mom, please, help!

939
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:46,401
- Please, get away.
- Start it!

940
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:47,986
Get off!

941
00:59:47,986 --> 00:59:50,071
Boy: You little faggot.

942
00:59:50,071 --> 00:59:55,493
- Mom, just go faster!
- Get off!

943
00:59:57,453 --> 01:00:01,833
Kids: Get her!

944
01:00:14,053 --> 01:00:16,014
Hey, Murph,

945
01:00:16,014 --> 01:00:19,058
tomorrow's my boy's birthday.

946
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:21,853
No kidding,
whatcha getting him?

947
01:00:21,853 --> 01:00:26,983
I'm thinking about
getting him a dress.

948
01:00:29,903 --> 01:00:31,988
Dispatch: Any unit respond...

949
01:00:32,071 --> 01:00:33,740
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

950
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,325
Dispatch:... possible hit and run.

951
01:00:35,408 --> 01:00:38,036
Hysterical female driver
left the scene.

952
01:00:38,036 --> 01:00:40,955
1970 Cadillac,
yellow convertible

953
01:00:40,955 --> 01:00:48,546
License plates, 'D-I-V-A.'
Parked at residence.

954
01:01:15,365 --> 01:01:17,534
Mrs. Battaglia:
Stop that sissy singing.

955
01:01:17,659 --> 01:01:19,619
Oh, Mom, I want to sing
with the angels.

956
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:22,664
No son of mine is going
to grow up to be an opera singer.

957
01:01:22,664 --> 01:01:23,998
You're going to make
something of yourself.

958
01:01:23,998 --> 01:01:25,792
- Give me my record.
- No.

959
01:01:25,792 --> 01:01:27,335
- Give it to me.
- No, I said!

960
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,420
- Stop it!
- Stop what? You're a sissy.

961
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:33,716
- I'm not a sissy.
- You are a sissy.

962
01:01:33,716 --> 01:01:37,971
No, don't say that.
Don't call me that.

963
01:01:56,656 --> 01:01:58,199
Here you go, ma'am.

964
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:00,201
Where's Dino?
Where's my husband?

965
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:02,787
I need Dino!
I need him!

966
01:02:02,787 --> 01:02:05,498
- He's on another call.
- I need Dino!

967
01:02:05,498 --> 01:02:08,209
He's back at the station,
Angela.

968
01:02:08,209 --> 01:02:10,837
- I need him, Benny.
- He didn't want to come.

969
01:02:10,837 --> 01:02:12,380
- I need him!
- I tried.

970
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,382
- Please!
- Angela, calm down.

971
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:16,968
- Please!
- I tried. I tried!

972
01:02:17,093 --> 01:02:18,970
How could you
do this to me?

973
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,638
You gotta get
my husband.

974
01:02:20,722 --> 01:02:23,641
You gotta get him.
You gotta get my husband.

975
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:24,392
He won't come.

976
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,477
- Mrs. Battaglia.
- Just get him.

977
01:02:26,477 --> 01:02:28,980
Please, please, please.

978
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,942
- You gotta get him.
- Angela, please.

979
01:02:32,942 --> 01:02:35,111
You gotta get my...

980
01:02:35,236 --> 01:02:36,279
Angela?

981
01:02:38,156 --> 01:02:39,490
Mom!

982
01:02:46,289 --> 01:02:48,166
Mom!

983
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,918
Dino...!

984
01:03:26,955 --> 01:03:31,751
Didn't your mommy get you shoes
to match the dress?

985
01:03:31,751 --> 01:03:33,211
Shut up.

986
01:03:48,434 --> 01:03:50,812
Mr. Battaglia?

987
01:03:50,937 --> 01:03:52,897
She's had a mild heart attack.

988
01:03:53,022 --> 01:03:56,150
She's okay, but we're going
to keep her here for a while.

989
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:00,947
About a week.

990
01:04:05,118 --> 01:04:10,206
What about the kid?

991
01:04:18,256 --> 01:04:21,467
Come on.
I've had enough.

992
01:04:21,593 --> 01:04:23,678
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

993
01:04:23,678 --> 01:04:28,766
- Home.
- What about him?

994
01:04:29,601 --> 01:04:34,189
What about him?

995
01:04:34,189 --> 01:04:36,816
This boy needs
a father, Dino.

996
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,570
What the hell would you know

997
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:44,115
about what a little boy needs?

998
01:04:48,995 --> 01:04:50,038
Come on.

999
01:05:02,967 --> 01:05:05,803
Can I please see my mom?

1000
01:05:05,887 --> 01:05:08,181
I'm sorry, son,
she's sleeping right now.

1001
01:05:08,181 --> 01:05:10,475
Maybe tomorrow, okay?

1002
01:05:10,475 --> 01:05:15,688
I'll let you know
when she's stable.

1003
01:05:48,847 --> 01:05:54,894
Next thing we're gonna do
is get you the hell out of that dress.

1004
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:08,992
Hey! Hey, kid!

1005
01:06:09,075 --> 01:06:14,706
- Man: Hey, move already!
- Up yours!

1006
01:06:22,964 --> 01:06:24,924
You are gonna be so sorry

1007
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:27,969
when I finally get
my hands on you!

1008
01:06:28,052 --> 01:06:30,972
I'm gonna make
such a man out of you!

1009
01:06:31,097 --> 01:06:32,765
Slow down!

1010
01:06:37,228 --> 01:06:43,484
Sorry, kid,
but don't screw with me.

1011
01:06:49,949 --> 01:06:55,371
Bruno: What are you going
to do with that?

1012
01:06:57,457 --> 01:07:01,336
Your father's father ran the Star
Barbershop on Market Street.

1013
01:07:01,419 --> 01:07:05,381
When he died,
I had to take over.

1014
01:07:05,381 --> 01:07:12,388
People came from miles around
for one of my haircuts.

1015
01:07:14,557 --> 01:07:16,351
Mm-hmm.

1016
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:19,145
I have a fresh
shirt for you

1017
01:07:19,145 --> 01:07:22,398
and a pair of pants
for school tomorrow.

1018
01:07:22,398 --> 01:07:24,359
I'm going
to school tomorrow?

1019
01:07:24,484 --> 01:07:26,361
Of course you're going
to school tomorrow.

1020
01:07:26,444 --> 01:07:29,072
It does not matter how many
words you know how to spell,

1021
01:07:29,072 --> 01:07:29,697
there's always more to learn.

1022
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:32,408
You're going to make something
of yourself. Good night.

1023
01:07:32,492 --> 01:07:36,162
Good night, Helen.

1024
01:07:36,162 --> 01:07:38,331
Helen: Breakfast will be
on the table in the morning.

1025
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:43,336
I'll see you after school.

1026
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:29,424
Son!

1027
01:08:36,431 --> 01:08:38,391
What are you doing here?

1028
01:08:38,516 --> 01:08:41,311
Your kid... he didn't come home
from school today.

1029
01:08:41,311 --> 01:08:44,355
He's not at Angela's house.
He's not at my house.

1030
01:08:44,355 --> 01:08:47,066
I thought maybe you would know
where he would be.

1031
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:51,029
Try looking in the girls'
department at Levy Brothers.

1032
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:53,948
Don't be a smart ass.
I need your help.

1033
01:08:53,948 --> 01:08:55,491
Why should I help?

1034
01:08:55,491 --> 01:08:57,076
Because he's your boy.

1035
01:08:57,076 --> 01:09:00,496
He's a sissy.

1036
01:09:00,496 --> 01:09:06,753
That's what he is.
He's a goddamned little sissy.

1037
01:09:06,753 --> 01:09:10,423
Just like me...

1038
01:09:10,423 --> 01:09:14,052
...remember?

1039
01:09:31,903 --> 01:09:36,908
You're not a sissy, Dino.

1040
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:51,714
Find him yourself.

1041
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:10,275
You're looking good.

1042
01:10:10,275 --> 01:10:12,026
Thanks.

1043
01:10:12,026 --> 01:10:13,611
How are you feeling?

1044
01:10:13,611 --> 01:10:15,363
Fine.

1045
01:10:15,363 --> 01:10:16,948
Is there anything
I can get for you?

1046
01:10:16,948 --> 01:10:17,991
No.

1047
01:10:18,074 --> 01:10:21,828
So what did the doctor say?
When are you getting out?

1048
01:10:21,828 --> 01:10:24,539
I don't know.
Next week.

1049
01:10:24,664 --> 01:10:27,250
So, has Bruno been around?

1050
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:29,252
Not today yet.

1051
01:10:29,252 --> 01:10:30,920
Where does the kid
like to hang out

1052
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,463
in case he's sad,
or something?

1053
01:10:32,463 --> 01:10:38,845
He doesn't hang out anywhere.
He stays at home.

1054
01:10:39,053 --> 01:10:40,513
Okay, gotta go.

1055
01:10:40,513 --> 01:10:41,639
Helen?

1056
01:10:43,725 --> 01:10:48,646
I'm letting go
of Dino.

1057
01:10:48,646 --> 01:10:53,526
I'm letting go
of your son.

1058
01:10:56,571 --> 01:10:58,114
Helen?

1059
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,367
I mean it.

1060
01:11:02,493 --> 01:11:03,745
Good.

1061
01:11:07,207 --> 01:11:08,750
Bye.

1062
01:11:42,242 --> 01:11:44,118
Boy: Hey, guys,
there's a fight over here.

1063
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:48,915
You'd better come look
at this.

1064
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,835
Hey!

1065
01:11:53,294 --> 01:11:55,880
Hey! Hey!

1066
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,465
What going on here?

1067
01:11:57,465 --> 01:12:01,010
- You okay, kid?
- Yeah.

1068
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,470
Go ahead.
Now...

1069
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:04,848
does anybody here know
a Bruno Battaglia?

1070
01:12:04,848 --> 01:12:06,015
Who wants to know?

1071
01:12:06,015 --> 01:12:08,601
Never mind.
Has anybody seen him lately?

1072
01:12:08,601 --> 01:12:11,229
What's it to you, Butch?

1073
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:14,148
Listen,
you shit-eating dickhead,

1074
01:12:14,232 --> 01:12:16,025
I asked you a question!

1075
01:12:16,109 --> 01:12:18,736
- I haven't seen him.
- What is your name, kid?

1076
01:12:18,736 --> 01:12:21,030
- Eddie Mazzaratti.
- Well, Eddie Mazzaratti,

1077
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:23,199
if you should happen
to see Bruno Battaglia,

1078
01:12:23,324 --> 01:12:25,285
you tell him Helen
is looking for him!

1079
01:12:25,285 --> 01:12:27,287
You got it?
Have you got it?

1080
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,247
- Yes.
- Okay! Who's next?

1081
01:12:29,372 --> 01:12:31,875
Boys: Run! Run!

1082
01:12:31,875 --> 01:12:37,088
Guys,
get me down from here!

1083
01:13:22,759 --> 01:13:24,093
Hey, kid!

1084
01:13:26,513 --> 01:13:31,309
Come on, kid,
let's go home.

1085
01:13:31,309 --> 01:13:32,227
Come on!

1086
01:13:51,621 --> 01:13:54,123
Why do you want to be
a little girl?

1087
01:13:54,123 --> 01:13:56,543
I don't want to be
a little girl.

1088
01:13:56,543 --> 01:13:58,837
What do you
want to be, then?

1089
01:13:58,837 --> 01:14:00,797
An etymologist.

1090
01:14:00,922 --> 01:14:02,882
What the hell is that?

1091
01:14:02,882 --> 01:14:07,470
A scientist
of the derivation of words,

1092
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:12,058
as to the history
of logistic forms.

1093
01:14:12,809 --> 01:14:14,561
Whatever.

1094
01:14:16,646 --> 01:14:19,065
Why do you want
to wear these dresses?

1095
01:14:19,065 --> 01:14:24,153
Well, they're not dresses.
They're holy vestments.

1096
01:14:24,153 --> 01:14:26,364
They give me power.

1097
01:14:26,364 --> 01:14:28,449
What kind of power?

1098
01:14:28,449 --> 01:14:31,244
Well, the kind of power
that you have.

1099
01:14:31,369 --> 01:14:36,583
The power to be mean.

1100
01:14:40,003 --> 01:14:44,174
But when you wear
thes e holy vestment dresses,

1101
01:14:44,174 --> 01:14:45,758
people want to kill you.

1102
01:14:45,758 --> 01:14:48,469
I don't care.

1103
01:14:48,469 --> 01:14:50,972
You don't care?

1104
01:14:50,972 --> 01:14:56,811
No. I'm not afraid
of death.

1105
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,479
You're not?

1106
01:14:58,479 --> 01:14:59,939
No.

1107
01:15:06,905 --> 01:15:10,867
I like that.

1108
01:15:10,867 --> 01:15:14,746
That, I like.

1109
01:15:16,915 --> 01:15:19,125
You know, for a little boy
who wears dresses,

1110
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:21,294
you've got a hell
of a set of balls, kid.

1111
01:15:21,294 --> 01:15:23,087
I know.

1112
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:31,513
Want a shot of whiskey?

1113
01:15:31,513 --> 01:15:34,349
Okay.

1114
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:06,548
Here's to you,
wearing your holy dresses,

1115
01:16:06,548 --> 01:16:11,970
and to being you,
whatever the hell that might be.

1116
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:16,766
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1117
01:16:34,492 --> 01:16:35,952
Ahem...

1118
01:16:41,374 --> 01:16:43,668
You mind if I smoke?

1119
01:16:43,668 --> 01:16:45,128
No.

1120
01:16:46,087 --> 01:16:50,675
But it's gonna turn
your soul black.

1121
01:16:50,675 --> 01:16:52,427
Whatever.

1122
01:17:03,897 --> 01:17:06,524
Listen, if you're going
to continue wearing dresses

1123
01:17:06,608 --> 01:17:07,984
you and I are going
to have to teach you

1124
01:17:07,984 --> 01:17:12,155
how to protect yourself.

1125
01:17:12,155 --> 01:17:14,240
Um-hmm.

1126
01:17:14,324 --> 01:17:15,909
The point of this game is

1127
01:17:15,992 --> 01:17:18,912
you're supposed to hit me
before I hit you.

1128
01:17:18,912 --> 01:17:23,917
Okay?
Have you got it?

1129
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:28,296
Put up your dukes!

1130
01:17:39,682 --> 01:17:40,934
Hello.

1131
01:17:40,934 --> 01:17:43,520
Oh, you're Shawniqua
Van Adams.

1132
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,896
Where are your parents?

1133
01:17:44,979 --> 01:17:46,564
My mommy's dead

1134
01:17:46,564 --> 01:17:49,067
and my daddy
lives in Afghanistan.

1135
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:50,401
Who takes care of you?

1136
01:17:50,401 --> 01:17:53,029
My brother, Henry.
He graduated college.

1137
01:17:53,112 --> 01:17:57,700
Oh, he's one of us.

1138
01:17:59,786 --> 01:18:03,331
You're big.

1139
01:18:03,331 --> 01:18:06,876
You're black.

1140
01:18:15,009 --> 01:18:16,386
Helen: The more glitter
the better.

1141
01:18:16,469 --> 01:18:18,346
Henry:
It's very Diana.

1142
01:18:18,346 --> 01:18:20,974
If we're gonna do Diana,
we're gonna do Diana bigger.

1143
01:18:21,057 --> 01:18:22,725
Bruno: The more glitter,
the more glamour.

1144
01:18:22,725 --> 01:18:23,768
Henry: Miss Ross,
eat your heart out.

1145
01:18:23,893 --> 01:18:26,604
Hand me another needle and
give me the buttonhole thread.

1146
01:18:26,688 --> 01:18:31,693
Mom, I have to sew
the zipper on by hand.

1147
01:18:31,818 --> 01:18:34,946
Careful of the sequins,
Helen.

1148
01:18:35,029 --> 01:18:37,866
Are you gonna cut the fabric
on the crossgrain or the grain?

1149
01:18:37,866 --> 01:18:39,951
- Crossgrain.
- Good, I can get a crossgrain.

1150
01:18:39,951 --> 01:18:42,245
We have to make
every single

1151
01:18:42,245 --> 01:18:44,747
buck I've invested pay off.

1152
01:18:44,831 --> 01:18:47,125
This hat's never gonna do.

1153
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:49,836
I wonder if I should
relax that wig?

1154
01:18:49,836 --> 01:18:52,964
Do you like the wig, Bruno?

1155
01:18:52,964 --> 01:18:55,049
Bruno, what do you
think of the wig?

1156
01:18:55,175 --> 01:18:56,217
It's good.

1157
01:18:56,217 --> 01:19:01,931
Helen: I think we'd better
tease it higher.

1158
01:19:02,682 --> 01:19:03,808
Good.

1159
01:19:03,808 --> 01:19:05,685
Fluff it.

1160
01:19:07,061 --> 01:19:08,605
Good afternoon...

1161
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:11,649
and welcome to the Manhattan
competition

1162
01:19:11,649 --> 01:19:13,943
of the 33rd Annual

1163
01:19:13,943 --> 01:19:20,074
National Catholic
Spelling Championship.

1164
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:31,252
Nun: All of our little boys
and girls have worked

1165
01:19:31,252 --> 01:19:33,630
very hard to represent
their schools.

1166
01:19:33,755 --> 01:19:36,883
And we are very proud
of them.

1167
01:19:36,883 --> 01:19:40,512
But only one from this district
will get to go on

1168
01:19:40,512 --> 01:19:44,057
to compete in the state
competition next week.

1169
01:19:44,182 --> 01:19:47,393
So... let's give a warm
round of applause

1170
01:19:47,393 --> 01:19:50,647
to the smartest
little girls and boys

1171
01:19:50,647 --> 01:19:55,443
from District 79.

1172
01:20:30,144 --> 01:20:34,941
Boy: It's a boy!

1173
01:20:34,941 --> 01:20:39,737
Yay, Bruno.
You go.

1174
01:20:40,989 --> 01:20:42,240
Don't.

1175
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,283
Get out of my way.

1176
01:20:43,408 --> 01:20:47,370
Don't do to him
what I did to you.

1177
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:49,330
He wants to sing.

1178
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:51,207
Let him.

1179
01:20:51,207 --> 01:20:56,546
Let your son sing.

1180
01:20:58,631 --> 01:21:02,385
Nun: What the heck do you
think you're doing?

1181
01:21:02,468 --> 01:21:06,431
Come over here.

1182
01:21:10,101 --> 01:21:15,190
Let him go.

1183
01:21:16,983 --> 01:21:20,111
I said, let him go.

1184
01:21:20,195 --> 01:21:25,408
You don't let him go,
you'd better start praying.

1185
01:21:28,661 --> 01:21:31,039
Now, for those of you
who don't know it,

1186
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:35,960
this is a little boy,
a little boy in a dress.

1187
01:21:36,044 --> 01:21:40,840
Anybody got a problem
with that can leave.

1188
01:22:01,402 --> 01:22:06,074
May I please have
my wig back now?

1189
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:12,247
Give the kid his hair.

1190
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:18,294
Bruno: Sometimes
when you least expect it,

1191
01:22:18,294 --> 01:22:19,754
a miracle happens.

1192
01:22:19,754 --> 01:22:22,048
And people be come elucidated.

1193
01:22:22,131 --> 01:22:24,968
They understand.

1194
01:22:24,968 --> 01:22:29,764
Now let's start
this friggin' bee.

1195
01:22:32,058 --> 01:22:36,104
Will the first contestant
please stand up?

1196
01:22:36,104 --> 01:22:38,940
Reporter: Bruno, wait,
just a few questions.

1197
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:41,651
- Make it quick.
- Why do you wear a dress?

1198
01:22:41,651 --> 01:22:43,319
- Don't tell them.
- How did it feel to win in a dress?

1199
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:44,237
Good.

1200
01:22:44,237 --> 01:22:45,613
Do you plan to wear
a dress to the next one?

1201
01:22:45,613 --> 01:22:46,739
That's enough of that.

1202
01:22:46,739 --> 01:22:48,324
- One photo.
- All right, one photo.

1203
01:22:48,324 --> 01:22:51,244
Hold up your trophy.
Higher, kid, higher.

1204
01:22:51,244 --> 01:22:52,495
Show them what
you're made of.

1205
01:22:52,495 --> 01:22:58,001
Great, that's it.
Are you from "Hard Copy"?

1206
01:22:58,001 --> 01:23:04,174
Oh, God, help me.

1207
01:23:16,144 --> 01:23:17,312
Helen:
We need to make you royal.

1208
01:23:17,312 --> 01:23:19,814
- More meretricious.
- Yeah, more of that.

1209
01:23:19,814 --> 01:23:22,734
And more regal
and more royal, too.

1210
01:23:22,734 --> 01:23:25,653
- That's what I said.
- Yeah, whatever.

1211
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:29,073
Bruno: Sovereign.

1212
01:23:29,073 --> 01:23:31,075
Splendid, like you, Helen.

1213
01:23:31,075 --> 01:23:32,202
I'm imperious.

1214
01:23:32,202 --> 01:23:37,415
- That'll work.
- Magnificent.

1215
01:23:42,003 --> 01:23:44,506
- Superb!
- Lavish!

1216
01:23:44,631 --> 01:23:47,217
- Munificent!
- Outrageous!

1217
01:23:47,217 --> 01:23:50,470
Helen: I crown thee, Bruno,
Queen of the Bees.

1218
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:52,430
Bruno rules.

1219
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:55,475
Woman: Here they come!

1220
01:23:55,475 --> 01:24:00,146
- Look this way into the camera.
- Where's your father?

1221
01:24:00,271 --> 01:24:04,859
- Who makes your dresses?
- Are you ready for fame, kid?

1222
01:24:04,943 --> 01:24:07,987
Well, it's ready for you.
Let's move.

1223
01:24:07,987 --> 01:24:09,113
Out of the way of the kid.

1224
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:10,573
Don't mess with the kid
or the dress.

1225
01:24:10,573 --> 01:24:12,033
Are you from "Hard Copy"?

1226
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:14,536
Watch out!
Give us some room!

1227
01:24:14,536 --> 01:24:16,538
Do not touch the dress.

1228
01:24:16,538 --> 01:24:22,669
- That's my son!
- Come on, Angela.

1229
01:24:24,337 --> 01:24:26,548
Do you have time
for an interview?

1230
01:24:26,548 --> 01:24:27,465
All right, quick.

1231
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:29,342
Would you mind
stepping up?

1232
01:24:29,342 --> 01:24:31,845
Okay, hike it up.

1233
01:24:31,845 --> 01:24:34,264
I'm standing here
with Bruno Battaglia,

1234
01:24:34,264 --> 01:24:35,932
the 8-year-old,
cross-dressing

1235
01:24:35,932 --> 01:24:38,518
spelling bee champion,
dressed like a queen,

1236
01:24:38,643 --> 01:24:41,229
formerly from Queens,
and some might say

1237
01:24:41,229 --> 01:24:42,897
he is a little queen.

1238
01:24:43,022 --> 01:24:44,065
Nope.

1239
01:24:44,065 --> 01:24:46,150
Okay, well, Bruno,
can you at least tell us

1240
01:24:46,234 --> 01:24:48,319
how did you come
to want to wear dresses?

1241
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:51,239
It came to me in a dream.

1242
01:24:51,364 --> 01:24:53,658
Could you describe
this dream for us?

1243
01:24:53,658 --> 01:24:55,326
- Uh, no.
- Mrs. Battaglia!

1244
01:24:55,326 --> 01:24:57,495
What's it like
seeing your son in drag?

1245
01:24:57,495 --> 01:25:00,748
I think it is
absolute beauty.

1246
01:25:00,748 --> 01:25:03,877
He looks a hell of a lot
better than you do.

1247
01:25:03,877 --> 01:25:06,880
Aren't you afraid
of what might happen to you

1248
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,339
if you keep
wearing dresses?

1249
01:25:08,339 --> 01:25:10,133
No.

1250
01:25:10,216 --> 01:25:12,844
What if you lose?
Will you continue to wear dresses?

1251
01:25:12,927 --> 01:25:14,596
I'm not gonna lose.

1252
01:25:14,596 --> 01:25:15,972
Yeah.

1253
01:25:15,972 --> 01:25:17,932
- Where's your father?
- No.

1254
01:25:18,057 --> 01:25:20,435
You don't ask that kind of question.
That's private.

1255
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,811
What about
the planned protest?

1256
01:25:21,895 --> 01:25:24,314
The religious right says
they're going to form

1257
01:25:24,314 --> 01:25:26,816
a human barricade
in Washington to stop you.

1258
01:25:26,816 --> 01:25:28,359
Nope, nobody's going
to stop us.

1259
01:25:28,484 --> 01:25:31,613
Nobody.
Get that clear.

1260
01:25:31,696 --> 01:25:34,824
Hey, Bruno,
are you gay?

1261
01:25:34,824 --> 01:25:37,452
I said, are you gay?

1262
01:25:37,452 --> 01:25:43,291
You know what I taught you.
Go get the little dickhead.

1263
01:25:55,595 --> 01:26:00,683
Kick his ass, Eddie,
come on!

1264
01:26:00,808 --> 01:26:02,143
Ha!

1265
01:26:03,186 --> 01:26:06,731
This is Shelia Ribando Fire,
reporting that Bruno Battaglia

1266
01:26:06,731 --> 01:26:08,107
has just won the right

1267
01:26:08,107 --> 01:26:11,110
to go all the way
to Washington DC in a dress.

1268
01:26:11,236 --> 01:26:16,533
Bob and Sue, back to you.

1269
01:26:55,113 --> 01:26:58,449
- Are you all right, Mom?
- Yeah. You?

1270
01:26:58,575 --> 01:26:59,492
Yeah.

1271
01:26:59,492 --> 01:27:06,374
"Wear a dress. Go to hell!"

1272
01:27:42,785 --> 01:27:46,539
Nice outfit.
Like it.

1273
01:27:46,623 --> 01:27:50,084
You should be ashamed!

1274
01:27:50,168 --> 01:27:52,795
Officer:
Back those people up.

1275
01:27:52,795 --> 01:27:54,464
This way, folks.

1276
01:27:54,547 --> 01:27:58,510
Hello, everyone,
welcome.

1277
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:01,554
Well, hello, Bruno,
we've been waiting for you.

1278
01:28:01,554 --> 01:28:02,889
Thank you.

1279
01:28:03,014 --> 01:28:04,891
What a very nice outfit.

1280
01:28:04,891 --> 01:28:06,434
Thank you.

1281
01:28:06,434 --> 01:28:10,730
Right this way. Sister Mary
Vivianna will show you in.

1282
01:28:10,813 --> 01:28:11,773
She has seats
for all of you.

1283
01:28:11,773 --> 01:28:13,316
You come with me, Bruno.

1284
01:28:13,441 --> 01:28:17,487
Mary Vivianna:
Come along, now.

1285
01:28:29,082 --> 01:28:30,416
Sit down.

1286
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:36,172
I can't believe this.

1287
01:28:36,172 --> 01:28:42,428
Okay, children,
wait here for the curtain.

1288
01:28:42,512 --> 01:28:47,225
Boy: Where's he going?

1289
01:28:51,604 --> 01:28:53,565
O- kay.

1290

1297

and a private audience
with Pope John Paul II.

1298
01:29:29,851 --> 01:29:33,730
So have a warm welcome
for all our contestants.

1299
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:39,152

Definition, please.

1305
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:23,238
"Shaped like a fern,
or fern frond. "

1306
01:30:23,363 --> 01:30:25,657
Can I have
the language of origin?

1307
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,116
Latin.

"Penury. "

1319
01:31:02,026 --> 01:31:04,112
Does this word
mean poverty?

1320
01:31:04,112 --> 01:31:06,114
Or scantiness.

1321
01:31:06,197 --> 01:31:09,033
Would you please
use it in a sentence?

1322
01:31:09,117 --> 01:31:11,828
"Emma could not
understand

why Jane chose
the mortification

of Mrs. Elton's notice...

1325
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:20,920
and the penury
of her conversation

1326
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:23,923
rather than return
to those who loved her

1327

with real,
generous affection. "

1328
