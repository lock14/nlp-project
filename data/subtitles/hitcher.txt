1
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:29,863
It's 4:15 on a Saturday morning
in El Paso town.

2
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:33,347
This is Uncle Bruce here going on
with the farm and market report...

3
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,551
on the station
all El Paso listens to.

4
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:08,043
My mother told me
never to do this.

5
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:21,028
Bless you.

6
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:26,029
My name's Jim Halsey.

7
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,608
John Ryder.

8
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:34,182
So you want me
to drop you off somewhere?

9
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:37,670
I'm getting your car wet.

10
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:40,491
Oh, this isn't my car.
It's a drive-away.

11
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:42,412
The owner's in San Diego.

12
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:49,066
So where you headed?

13
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:55,786
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, sure.

14
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,213
You gonna tell me
where you're going?

15
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,871
Yeah, sure.

16
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:22,149
What are you looking
at me like that for?

17
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,301
Just looking.

18
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,711
What are you doing?

19
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,413
What'd you do that for?

20
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:51,182
I asked you a question.

21
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,397
Scare you?

22
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:07,371
Look, I think you better
get out now.

23
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:12,268
The ride's over.

24
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:18,727
Good-bye.

25
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,543
I'm gonna sit here...

26
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:43,077
and you're gonna drive.

27
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:52,239
Excuse me.

28
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:58,603
- What's wrong with that car back there?
- Why?

29
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,942
Thought I saw something,
that's all.

30
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:10,315
- I ran out of gas.
- So you need a gas station?

31
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,847
Would help.

32
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:13,448
Okay.

33
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:29,895
Gas stations have cigarettes.

34
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,512
What about gas?

35
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,855
I don't need gas.

36
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,951
What do you want?

37
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:55,375
What's so funny?

38
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,159
That's what the other guy said.

39
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,462
Who's the other guy?

40
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:05,265
The guy who was driving that car back
there. Picked me up before you did.

41
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:09,067
- Was that him in the car?
- I'm sure it was.

42
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:11,504
He couldn't have walked very far.

43
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,616
Why is that?

44
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,137
Because I cut off his legs...

45
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:24,650
and his arms...

46
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,586
and his head.

47
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:33,490
And I'm gonna do
the same to you.

48
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:00,490
Don't.

49
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:15,659
What part of Illinois you from?

50
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,177
- What?
- Your license plate.

51
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,651
Tell the man.

52
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:29,937
Chicago.

53
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:32,874
My wife's from Rockford.
You got a cigarette?

54
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:44,147
All right, the road's clear now.
Come on. Get going, sweethearts.

55
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,234
Drive.

56
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:17,775
You want to know what happens
to an eyeball when it gets punctured?

57
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:24,174
You got any idea how much blood jets out
of a guy's neck...

58
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:26,350
when his throat's been slit?

59
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:30,925
What do you want?

60
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,983
I want you to stop me.

61
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:42,094
You got the knife.

62
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,532
You'll stick me with it
before I can do anything.

63
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:48,307
That's right. So what have you
got to lose? Stop me.

64
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:55,821
Crying isn't gonna help.

65
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:01,940
Keep driving!

66
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:08,340
Please. I'll do anything.

67
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:11,153
Say four words:

68
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:14,829
Say...

69
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,156
"I want to die."

70
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:23,252
Say what?

71
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:27,858
"I want to die."

72
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,781
Say it.

73
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:35,439
- I don't know if I can say that.
- Sure you can.

74
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,845
Repeat after me.

75
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,667
"I...

76
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,165
want...

77
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:54,861
to...

78
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,365
die."

79
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:12,977
I don't want to die!

80
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:32,173
Fuck you, buddy!

81
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:10,455
Jesus Christ!

82
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,904
Hey! Pull over!

83
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:27,503
Pull over! The guy
in your car's a nut!

84
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:28,854
Shoot him.

85
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:32,337
That guy's a fucking nut
in your car! Pull over!

86
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,509
- Kill him.
- That guy will kill you!

87
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,383
That guy, get him
out of your car!

88
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:04,469
Where do you think you're going?
Come back!

89
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,875
Oh, fuck.

90
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,316
Come on, you son of a bitch.

91
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:47,347
Hey, stop! Stop!

92
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:48,950
Wait!

93
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,054
- Okay, see you at 4:00.
- Bye-bye.

94
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,035
Shit.

95
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:49,121
We're closed. We don't open
for another 45 minutes.

96
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:50,781
Please, I need to use a phone!

97
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:53,439
Sorry. I can't let you in.
We're closed.

98
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,655
No! Listen.

99
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:58,981
- Please, I have to call the cops.
- What happened?

100
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:02,044
I can't explain right now.
I just need to use the phone.

101
00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:08,133
If Jack saw me doing this,
he'd kick my butt.

102
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,029
Phone's around the corner. Go on.

103
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:16,447
You stink of gasoline.
Were you in an accident?

104
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,001
Hello, police? My name's Jim Halsey.
I know who killed those people in...

105
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:38,242
I picked this guy up hitchhiking...

106
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:40,997
Same guy blew up the gas station.

107
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:45,121
Jim Halsey. H-A-L-S-E-Y.

108
00:24:46,023 --> 00:24:48,478
I'm at the Longhorn Restaurant.

109
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:50,241
You do?

110
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:53,278
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I won't go anywhere.

111
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:12,477
Jesus.

112
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:10,595
If you think the cops are gonna arrive
soon, you got another thing coming.

113
00:26:10,664 --> 00:26:14,209
A guy got shot in the corner
a couple months ago.

114
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,858
It took them 45 minutes to get here
with the ambulance.

115
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:20,743
By that time
the poor guy was dead.

116
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:25,158
Specialty of the house.

117
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:29,152
Actually the cook's not here yet.
It's the only thing I know how to make.

118
00:26:29,224 --> 00:26:32,290
Thanks.
That's real nice of you.

119
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:34,335
Everything gonna be okay?

120
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,059
I hope so.

121
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:40,424
You sure look
a whole lot better.

122
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:43,042
Guess it's safe for me
to smoke now, huh?

123
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:52,167
Sorry I gave you
such a hard time, but...

124
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:55,297
you'd be surprised the kind of trash
that passes through here.

125
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:59,750
- How is it?
- Real good. Thanks.

126
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,825
My name's Nash.

127
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:09,480
I really appreciate this.

128
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:14,016
- Where you from?
- Chicago.

129
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:17,088
- Where you headed?
- California.

130
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:19,527
How'd you know that?

131
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:23,040
That's where everyone's going.
Hollywood?

132
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:24,870
No. San Diego.

133
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:27,207
I thought about moving
to California.

134
00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:31,652
Jeremy, who owns this place...
he's my cousin.

135
00:27:31,722 --> 00:27:34,536
And Uncle Jack does the cooking.

136
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:36,456
Like that, see?

137
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:39,075
We're all kind of interrelated.

138
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:42,787
It's kind of hard
to just pick up and leave.

139
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:45,061
But you never know.

140
00:27:48,683 --> 00:27:50,919
My brother Bill is from Mars.

141
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:54,630
Actually we're all from Mars here.
We keep our spaceship out back.

142
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:57,960
So, what planet are you from?

143
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:05,089
What?

144
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:07,976
You haven't heard a word
I said, have you?

145
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:10,245
Yes, I have.

146
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,281
That's okay. Go on.
Eat your cheeseburger.

147
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:16,485
I gotta get some stuff
out of the freezer anyway.

148
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:06,121
Stay where you are! Put your hands
in the air. Get down on the ground!

149
00:29:06,188 --> 00:29:07,846
Wait a minute!
He's in there!

150
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:11,046
Get your ass on the cement,
or we open fire!

151
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,970
I'm not gonna tell you again!

152
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:33,515
Put your hands
behind your back slow.

153
00:29:54,477 --> 00:29:56,516
- My wallet's in my pocket.
- Shut up!

154
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:58,760
We know how to do it.

155
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,301
Jesus!

156
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:19,747
Oh, my God! He put that there!

157
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:23,234
Now shut up.

158
00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:26,182
Don't move.

159
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:32,678
What's going on?
What'd you do to him?

160
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:37,352
- You keep to yourself.
- Why you arresting him?

161
00:30:37,422 --> 00:30:41,066
Pick up that stuff.
Do you know this guy?

162
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:43,755
Not really.

163
00:30:43,821 --> 00:30:46,187
Then what the hell
is he doing inside?

164
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:49,002
Half the cops in the state
are looking for this creep.

165
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:51,687
Let's get this sack of shit
out of here.

166
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:10,982
Where's your driver's license,
your I.D.?

167
00:31:12,942 --> 00:31:15,113
Where are your credit cards?

168
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:21,771
The guy I've been telling you about
took my wallet and planted the knife.

169
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,976
My license was in my wallet.

170
00:31:24,046 --> 00:31:26,412
I don't have any credit cards.

171
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:33,005
I suppose he took
your vehicle registration too?

172
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:42,093
What's a young kid like you driving
such a fancy car? You steal it?

173
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:47,686
The car doesn't belong to me.

174
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,864
It's a drive-away.

175
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:53,033
I'm supposed to be delivering it
to California.

176
00:31:53,103 --> 00:31:55,688
The guy's in San Diego.

177
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:59,685
What's his name?

178
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:13,190
I don't remember.

179
00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:20,391
But I know the number of the drive-away
company. Why don't you call them?

180
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:24,173
Hell, son. You better start calling
somebody 'cause you're in deep shit.

181
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,884
It's 312-399-2090.

182
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:31,496
I know the number so well
because I called them so many times.

183
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:33,902
I was on their waiting list
for a month.

184
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:36,836
I wanted a car going
to California.

185
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:38,766
That's why it took so long.

186
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,799
Thank you for calling
Midwest Drive-away.

187
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:45,319
Our Chicago office hours are
9:00 to 5:00, Monday through Friday.

188
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:47,301
Closed Saturday and...

189
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:50,671
Well, now what are we gonna do?

190
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:52,776
You got one more call.

191
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:57,223
Call my brother, for God's sakes!
He'll be home.

192
00:32:57,297 --> 00:32:59,533
It's 312-905-9044.

193
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:23,759
Maybe you didn't let it
ring long enough.

194
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:29,743
Do I look like a killer to you?

195
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:39,180
Folks coming in from Austin tomorrow
gonna be interested in talking to you.

196
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:42,118
I'm gonna give you a chance
to get some rest.

197
00:33:42,193 --> 00:33:45,160
Get him locked up.
Get him out of my sight.

198
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:49,550
Let's go.

199
00:33:51,826 --> 00:33:53,898
Jack?

200
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:57,100
That kid isn't a killer.
Any fool could see that.

201
00:33:59,282 --> 00:34:01,648
Okay, face front.

202
00:34:01,714 --> 00:34:03,688
Hold real still.

203
00:34:05,202 --> 00:34:07,056
Now turn to your right.

204
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,896
Steady.

205
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,976
Make it your left.

206
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:18,571
Oh, those are real good.
Your mama's gonna like those.

207
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:22,703
Let's go.

208
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,031
You behave yourself now.

209
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:00,395
Hello?

210
00:39:40,984 --> 00:39:43,798
Go! I'm right behind you.
Come on!

211
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,316
Let's go.

212
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:20,818
Come on, come on.

213
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:24,663
Stop!

214
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,617
- Take her easy!
- Tell me about it.

215
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:29,649
Get over by the car.

216
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,948
Those cuffs on your belt...

217
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:39,669
take them off and lock
your partner's hands behind his back.

218
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:42,073
- You mean me?
- I mean you.

219
00:41:42,138 --> 00:41:44,047
You! Yes, you!

220
00:41:48,187 --> 00:41:51,285
Okay. We're gonna go
for a little ride now.

221
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:54,072
You two get in the front.
I'll get in the back.

222
00:41:55,323 --> 00:41:58,584
- One of you open the door.
- Open the door, Jack.

223
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:04,121
Get in the car!

224
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:08,659
You and me, we're gonna
get in together, okay?

225
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:14,712
Ready...

226
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:16,305
steady...

227
00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:19,218
go.

228
00:42:25,947 --> 00:42:29,492
- Can I close the door?
- Shut the door.

229
00:42:30,588 --> 00:42:32,442
Start the car.

230
00:42:34,716 --> 00:42:36,887
Head for the highway.

231
00:42:54,076 --> 00:42:57,905
Can you call out on that thing and get
me connected with somebody in charge?

232
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,395
I'll try to get through
to Captain Esteridge.

233
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:05,330
Do it. But don't tell anybody
where we are.

234
00:43:07,996 --> 00:43:10,930
- Central, this is car number...
- I said don't tell them anything.

235
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:17,970
Central, this is one of your cars
and we've been hijacked by suspect.

236
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,095
He wishes to speak
to Captain Esteridge directly. Over.

237
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,808
Esteridge 10-11.
We'll try to locate. Standby.

238
00:43:26,877 --> 00:43:29,146
10-12, El Paso. Clear.

239
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:41,396
This is Captain Esteridge.
Do you read? Over.

240
00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:49,458
Captain, this is Jim Halsey.

241
00:43:49,533 --> 00:43:53,755
You gotta listen to me, Captain.
I swear I didn't kill those people.

242
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:56,887
I got framed by this guy
I picked up hitchhiking.

243
00:43:56,957 --> 00:43:58,866
What do you suggest
we do, son?

244
00:43:58,942 --> 00:44:01,625
Come on, man. You tell me.

245
00:44:01,693 --> 00:44:03,580
Why don't you
stop things right now...

246
00:44:03,646 --> 00:44:06,995
let my men go
and give yourself up?

247
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,012
I don't have identification.

248
00:44:09,118 --> 00:44:12,117
I don't have anybody to call
for you to check me out.

249
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,037
Are you willing to lay down
your arms and surrender?

250
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:19,379
I promise I'll do everything in my power
to see to it you're treated fairly.

251
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,543
I'm putting my trust in you, Captain.

252
00:44:29,054 --> 00:44:31,323
Take us in.

253
00:45:37,376 --> 00:45:38,902
Bang.

254
00:46:57,697 --> 00:46:59,551
Well, I know
you caught something...

255
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:03,359
because you're probably
the best dang fisherman around here.

256
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:05,945
But if that's the best
you can eat...

257
00:47:06,017 --> 00:47:08,570
I don't know what you're
gonna be able to do.

258
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:10,845
That'll tide us over until...

259
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:12,953
Looks to me like you best go.

260
00:47:13,026 --> 00:47:16,255
- Better get on the road.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

261
00:47:16,322 --> 00:47:18,591
Bye, Alice.

262
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:20,511
Well, what happened to you?

263
00:47:20,577 --> 00:47:22,584
Nothing.

264
00:47:23,553 --> 00:47:24,829
Nothing?

265
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:26,752
Nothing happened.

266
00:47:30,466 --> 00:47:33,761
- I need some coffee.
- It's brewing.

267
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:40,183
- Bring it to me at one of the booths.
- You okay, kid?

268
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:19,094
How do you like Shitsville?

269
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:26,526
Don't you move.

270
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:29,978
You stay seated
right where you are...

271
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:34,113
or I'll blow your brains
through your ass.

272
00:48:38,403 --> 00:48:39,929
The gun is empty.

273
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:54,750
You never checked it,
did you?

274
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:57,753
So help me,
I'll blow you in half.

275
00:48:59,748 --> 00:49:01,886
All right.
Squeeze the trigger.

276
00:49:01,956 --> 00:49:04,028
I will.

277
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:06,684
- Please.
- Oh, I will.

278
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:11,295
'Cause you can sure as shit bet
I'm gonna squeeze mine.

279
00:49:16,483 --> 00:49:17,944
Bam!

280
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,883
Why are you doing this to me?

281
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,386
Come here.

282
00:50:02,405 --> 00:50:04,674
You're a smart kid.

283
00:50:05,957 --> 00:50:07,811
Figure it out.

284
00:53:30,089 --> 00:53:33,471
I didn't do it.
I didn't do any of it.

285
00:53:34,824 --> 00:53:37,279
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

286
00:53:37,353 --> 00:53:39,207
I'm not a killer.

287
00:53:42,505 --> 00:53:44,839
This morning this guy
tried to kill me.

288
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:47,010
He's been following me
ever since.

289
00:53:47,081 --> 00:53:49,153
I don't know why.

290
00:53:52,265 --> 00:53:54,785
Do you believe me?

291
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:58,534
Sure.

292
00:54:02,442 --> 00:54:04,678
No, you don't.

293
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:06,916
I wouldn't either.

294
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:12,612
Let's go sit down.

295
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,501
What are you gonna do?

296
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:46,944
Give up.

297
00:54:48,587 --> 00:54:49,993
I have no choice.

298
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,856
Nice and easy. Come on.

299
00:55:14,923 --> 00:55:16,068
Step down.

300
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,254
All right, step down.

301
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:27,880
I'm turning myself in.

302
00:55:29,131 --> 00:55:32,840
Get out from behind the door!
Step away from the bus. Get down!

303
00:55:32,907 --> 00:55:34,467
Move!

304
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,321
Move your ass now!

305
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:41,034
I'm giving up
and I'm not guilty.

306
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,679
You just wasted
two of my friends.

307
00:55:53,323 --> 00:55:57,479
- You spit on my wrist.
- What?

308
00:55:57,548 --> 00:56:00,198
I said, "You spit on my wrist."

309
00:56:00,268 --> 00:56:02,537
Wipe it off.

310
00:56:04,268 --> 00:56:05,828
You can see I'm unarmed.

311
00:56:05,899 --> 00:56:07,655
Wipe it off!

312
00:56:07,724 --> 00:56:09,895
- Come on, Lyle. Go easy.
- Shut up!

313
00:56:09,964 --> 00:56:12,233
- Let's get him back to the station.
- I said, "Shut up!"

314
00:56:13,196 --> 00:56:14,657
Wipe it off!

315
00:56:14,732 --> 00:56:16,706
Put the gun down.

316
00:56:20,716 --> 00:56:22,952
Goddamn you.

317
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,271
Drop your guns! Don't turn around.
Just drop them.

318
00:56:29,837 --> 00:56:32,870
I can't believe you were gonna do
what you were gonna do.

319
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,914
Don't you know who he is?

320
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,435
You got the wrong man, Lyle.

321
00:56:40,557 --> 00:56:43,110
Like hell we do.
Now just settle down and...

322
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:46,442
- Don't come any closer.
- Hand me that gun.

323
00:56:50,829 --> 00:56:54,090
Just empty them.
You're in enough trouble already.

324
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:56,425
You just threw your life
down the toilet, girl.

325
00:56:56,493 --> 00:57:00,202
When the truth comes down,
I'll be just fine.

326
00:57:00,269 --> 00:57:03,335
I'm taking him to
the sheriff's office in Riley.

327
00:57:03,405 --> 00:57:04,615
You stay put.

328
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:07,879
Let's go.

329
00:57:31,245 --> 00:57:34,059
- Now what?
- We're going to Riley.

330
00:57:45,134 --> 00:57:48,647
- Do you know how to use the radio?
- I better let you out here.

331
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:51,303
No. If I'm in the car with you,
they're not gonna hurt you.

332
00:57:51,374 --> 00:57:53,992
- We can talk to them by radio.
- What are you gonna say?

333
00:57:54,062 --> 00:57:55,850
We're gonna turn ourselves in.

334
00:58:01,551 --> 00:58:03,917
Buckle your seat belt.

335
00:58:03,982 --> 00:58:05,508
Do mine.

336
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:20,008
Hello? Can you read me?
We want to turn ourselves in.

337
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,013
We're turning ourselves in.
Can you read me? Over.

338
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,515
Listen to me this time.
We are turning ourselves in.

339
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:37,452
We just want to turn ourselves in!
Do you read me?

340
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:39,373
Hello!

341
00:58:39,439 --> 00:58:41,413
The bastard's on his way.

342
00:58:43,343 --> 00:58:45,644
Hold it there.
That's a good speed.

343
00:58:46,703 --> 00:58:47,750
Shit.

344
00:58:52,879 --> 00:58:56,294
Get the gun! Use it!

345
00:58:56,368 --> 00:58:59,499
- No, I'm not gonna shoot anybody!
- Aim for the tire.

346
00:59:00,368 --> 00:59:03,117
- Oh, God!
- They're gonna kill us!

347
00:59:07,024 --> 00:59:09,511
- Use it! Shoot 'em!
- No!

348
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,348
I got you.

349
00:59:17,424 --> 00:59:19,049
Jesus Christ! Use the gun!

350
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,246
Shoot back!

351
00:59:30,736 --> 00:59:33,191
You got him. Watch it.

352
00:59:33,264 --> 00:59:35,817
She's got a gun.
Watch it. Get down.

353
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,567
You got him.

354
00:59:41,297 --> 00:59:42,540
I dropped the gun.

355
00:59:43,632 --> 00:59:45,486
You what?

356
00:59:57,745 --> 00:59:59,501
Get the shotgun!

357
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,839
Be careful, now.

358
01:00:17,873 --> 01:00:19,367
There you go.

359
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:22,632
Hold on!

360
01:00:24,401 --> 01:00:26,408
Holy shit!

361
01:00:51,506 --> 01:00:53,961
Are you okay?

362
01:00:54,034 --> 01:00:56,521
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

363
01:01:07,282 --> 01:01:09,999
1073, 221, are you okay?

364
01:02:08,051 --> 01:02:10,058
Let's go, you son of a bitch!

365
01:02:40,436 --> 01:02:41,646
Oh, God.

366
01:04:17,142 --> 01:04:19,563
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

367
01:04:24,662 --> 01:04:27,476
- Why didn't he kill us?
- Let's go.

368
01:04:30,326 --> 01:04:32,300
Why didn't he kill us?

369
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:37,484
Let's go.

370
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:40,980
Are you okay?

371
01:05:46,392 --> 01:05:49,010
Why'd you pick him up?

372
01:05:54,232 --> 01:05:56,370
I wanted to help him...

373
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:00,243
and I was tired.

374
01:06:00,311 --> 01:06:03,093
I thought he'd
help me stay awake.

375
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:08,374
Can I sit by you?

376
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,934
- What are you doing?
- I want to call my father.

377
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,334
- No. No calls.
- It's only my father.

378
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,025
I said, no calls.

379
01:06:28,056 --> 01:06:30,870
Not until we figure out
what we're gonna do.

380
01:06:30,936 --> 01:06:33,041
I can explain it.

381
01:06:33,112 --> 01:06:35,250
It's not that simple.

382
01:06:37,689 --> 01:06:39,543
I already tried.

383
01:06:41,529 --> 01:06:43,383
I'm scared.

384
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:48,405
Me too.

385
01:07:02,361 --> 01:07:03,887
Thanks.

386
01:07:44,762 --> 01:07:46,136
Nash?

387
01:07:49,306 --> 01:07:51,160
Are you awake?

388
01:08:22,202 --> 01:08:24,056
Let's head 'em out!

389
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:11,256
No, I'm okay. Don't...

390
01:09:13,019 --> 01:09:15,091
I'm okay.

391
01:09:17,308 --> 01:09:19,893
I just want you
to know where I am.

392
01:09:29,692 --> 01:09:32,691
Everybody's
got this whole thing wrong.

393
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:36,891
No, I sound funny,
but I'm okay.

394
01:11:30,526 --> 01:11:32,795
The Apostle Paul told us
to look within ourselves...

395
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,837
for the very spirit of faith.

396
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:37,757
You must look to nature where
the spirit is replenished daily.

397
01:11:37,823 --> 01:11:41,336
I'm Reverend Hollis Maxwell inviting you
to visit a church this Sunday.

398
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:45,779
This is Channel 3,
KCIK Television, in Texas...

399
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:48,026
licensed by the F.C.C.
in Washington, D. C...

400
01:11:48,094 --> 01:11:49,948
ending its broadcast day.

401
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,697
We invite you to join us
tomorrow at 6:00 A.M.

402
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,079
All right.
Don't hurt him, Ed.

403
01:13:17,153 --> 01:13:19,258
You take it easy now.
Are you Jim Halsey?

404
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:21,718
- Who are you?
- I'm Captain Esteridge.

405
01:13:21,793 --> 01:13:24,248
We spoke on the radio.

406
01:13:24,321 --> 01:13:26,295
Where is she?

407
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:30,012
You come along with us now.
We're gonna need your help.

408
01:13:39,265 --> 01:13:42,232
Hostage situation.

409
01:13:42,305 --> 01:13:44,159
Hold your fire.

410
01:13:50,369 --> 01:13:52,059
Hold it!

411
01:13:52,129 --> 01:13:53,917
Please, don't!

412
01:13:53,985 --> 01:13:56,668
Why don't you do something?
Fuckin' do something!

413
01:13:56,737 --> 01:13:58,395
We can't!

414
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:01,150
Hold it!

415
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:09,376
- No!
- Do something!

416
01:14:09,442 --> 01:14:12,638
If we shoot him, his foot will come off
that clutch, and that truck will roll.

417
01:14:16,897 --> 01:14:18,173
Please!

418
01:14:18,242 --> 01:14:22,170
Now, you get in there
and you see what you can do.

419
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:26,104
Please, do something!

420
01:14:26,178 --> 01:14:28,927
Please, help!

421
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:13,465
She's sweet.

422
01:15:20,387 --> 01:15:22,329
The gun is loaded.

423
01:15:24,323 --> 01:15:26,297
Go for it.

424
01:15:26,371 --> 01:15:28,542
Go ahead. Pick it up.

425
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:37,790
Tell you what... I'll let you hold
the gun on me before I do anything.

426
01:15:39,492 --> 01:15:40,898
They'll catch you.

427
01:15:40,963 --> 01:15:42,817
Please!

428
01:15:42,883 --> 01:15:45,501
Yeah. Sure.

429
01:15:47,139 --> 01:15:48,993
So what?

430
01:15:55,427 --> 01:15:57,848
Pick up the gun.

431
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:02,748
Do something!

432
01:16:03,716 --> 01:16:05,658
Put it in my face.

433
01:16:07,172 --> 01:16:08,219
Right there.

434
01:16:12,324 --> 01:16:14,495
That's good.

435
01:16:14,564 --> 01:16:16,451
You know what to do.

436
01:16:16,516 --> 01:16:18,490
Now do it.

437
01:16:19,556 --> 01:16:21,825
Squeeze the trigger.

438
01:16:28,036 --> 01:16:29,890
She'll die.

439
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,858
Oh, God.

440
01:16:52,037 --> 01:16:54,142
You useless...

441
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:57,054
waste.

442
01:17:19,109 --> 01:17:22,370
I can't tell you
how sorry I am for you, son.

443
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:30,467
Anything I can do for you?

444
01:17:35,269 --> 01:17:37,724
When you're finished here,
you should go see a real doctor...

445
01:17:37,797 --> 01:17:39,902
and get a complete checkup.

446
01:17:42,054 --> 01:17:44,388
We all know there
was nothing you could do.

447
01:17:54,534 --> 01:17:57,251
- Who is he?
- We don't know.

448
01:17:57,318 --> 01:18:00,001
No prison record,
no driver's license...

449
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:02,787
no birth certificate.

450
01:18:02,854 --> 01:18:05,504
We ran his prints
through the computers...

451
01:18:05,574 --> 01:18:08,607
and we came up with nothin'.

452
01:18:08,678 --> 01:18:12,540
I know we'll find something, but
right now, I don't even know his name.

453
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:20,580
How do you feel?

454
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,444
Tired.

455
01:18:26,887 --> 01:18:29,505
He can't see us or hear us.

456
01:18:32,839 --> 01:18:34,781
I want to talk to him.

457
01:18:34,855 --> 01:18:37,342
What's your name?

458
01:18:38,855 --> 01:18:40,229
Come on.

459
01:18:43,047 --> 01:18:46,308
Come on.
What's your name?

460
01:18:50,855 --> 01:18:52,545
Do you have a name?

461
01:18:52,615 --> 01:18:54,469
John Ryder.

462
01:19:00,423 --> 01:19:02,081
What'd you say?

463
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,242
His name is John Ryder.

464
01:19:07,335 --> 01:19:09,822
Do you have a police record?

465
01:19:14,343 --> 01:19:16,197
Where are you from?

466
01:19:19,624 --> 01:19:21,216
Disneyland.

467
01:19:23,687 --> 01:19:25,988
How long do we
have to play this game?

468
01:19:26,056 --> 01:19:27,910
Y'all give me a minute?

469
01:19:32,232 --> 01:19:34,086
Come on.

470
01:20:18,857 --> 01:20:22,980
All right, that's enough of that.
It was a bad idea in the first place.

471
01:21:13,129 --> 01:21:16,806
Captain Esteridge,
is it true that...

472
01:21:16,874 --> 01:21:18,728
No comment.

473
01:21:40,715 --> 01:21:42,569
All right, son.
Get in the car.

474
01:22:51,596 --> 01:22:53,450
Are you okay?

475
01:22:59,244 --> 01:23:00,902
You'll never hold him.

476
01:23:02,572 --> 01:23:06,249
All right, you listen up now,
and you listen good, son.

477
01:23:06,316 --> 01:23:10,309
There's something strange between you.
I don't want to know what it is.

478
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:13,030
But I'm telling you,
he is in our hands now...

479
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:17,543
and whatever happens to him,
it won't be decided by you.

480
01:23:17,613 --> 01:23:21,028
It doesn't have anything
to do with you anymore.

481
01:23:22,925 --> 01:23:25,030
Okay?

482
01:23:42,861 --> 01:23:45,511
Can I have one of your cigarettes?

483
01:23:45,581 --> 01:23:47,304
Sure.

484
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:55,179
Stop the car.

485
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:00,875
You're not gonna use that thing.

486
01:24:03,981 --> 01:24:07,047
Stop the car,
and don't do anything stupid.

487
01:24:20,366 --> 01:24:23,432
All right.
What's on your mind?

488
01:24:26,062 --> 01:24:27,436
Get out.

489
01:24:29,518 --> 01:24:31,372
You're gonna get yourself killed.

490
01:24:31,438 --> 01:24:34,787
And if you don't, you're gonna be
in a whole lot of trouble.

491
01:24:37,518 --> 01:24:39,372
I'm sorry, sir.

492
01:24:41,006 --> 01:24:44,235
- It's something I gotta do.
- You don't know what you're doin'.

493
01:24:45,358 --> 01:24:47,212
Yeah...

494
01:24:47,278 --> 01:24:49,350
I do.

495
01:26:35,504 --> 01:26:37,773
Hi, kid.

496
01:27:52,082 --> 01:27:53,936
Come on.

497
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:25,836
Come on!

498
01:33:23,737 --> 01:33:27,511
