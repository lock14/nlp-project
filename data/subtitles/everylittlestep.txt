1
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,779
I really want to talk about us.

2
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:27,078
Now, I don't know whether anything
will come of this.

3
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,087
Or whether there is anything in this.

4
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:34,218
I think we're all pretty interesting,
and that all of you are pretty interesting.

5
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,821
And I think that maybe
there's a show in there somewhere,

6
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,399
Which would be called A Chorus Line.

7
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,436
Five, six, seven, eight.

8
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,327
Okay. Let's do the ballet combination
one more time.

9
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,331
Boys and girls, do it together.
Don't kill yourselves.

10
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,197
Mark. A one, two, three, four, five, six.

11
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,547
Good, and...

12
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:37,145
Boys in the back, like that.
Round and round. Back to back.

13
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,524
Number nine. Number 10. Number 23.

14
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,762
It's numbers 15 through 22,
and my two ladies.

15
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,897
Forty-Five. Sixty-Three.

16
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,170
Number 75.

17
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,732
Everybody else, thanks a lot, guys.

18
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,505
Cassie.

19
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,607
I need you to sign in, get a dance card.
Remember your number.

20
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,846
What's going to happen
when you go upstairs.

21
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,186
Is we're going to go in in groups of 10.
We're going to do a double pirouette.

22
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,284
All we're looking at right now
is technique and type.

23
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,794
And then you're going to stay
or you're gonna go.

24
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,126
If you get kept,
there's a lot more dancing to be done.

25
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,291
But I just need you guys to be ready
as quickly as possible

26
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,732
So we can just sort of bang it out.

27
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,327
And then you can move on
with the rest of your life today, okay?

28
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,439
-Thank you.
-Thank you, ladies.

29
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,213
A Chorus Line, I think,
is every performer's story.

30
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,717
You understand them.

31
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,116
They're funny. They're real.

32
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,985
It's like the history of the dancer in theater.

33
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:20,025
A Chorus Line just stands
for what classic Broadway is.

34
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,527
I would love to sing Tits and Ass.

35
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,086
The whole show
is an audition for a chorus line,

36
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,358
And that's basically what we're doing now

37
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,558
In the whole audition process.

38
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,569
Every actor, everybody, thinks of that song,
God, I Hope I Get It,

39
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,934
Every time they go to an audition.

40
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,462
To begin auditions, we saw everybody.

41
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,260
First, we saw professionals. Actors,
Equity members who carried a union card.

42
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,858
And second,
we saw non-Equity, non-Professionals

43
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,927
Trying to get on Broadway for the first time.

44
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,867
Three thousand people
auditioned for the show.

45
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,603
If you said on your resume
that you could dance,

46
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,873
We basically saw you
at some point in the process.

47
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,911
Typically, it's not this busy, I don't think,
at open calls.

48
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,712
Yeah, this is the biggest one I've been to.

49
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,379
That holding room is great.
You should take a look. It's just like...

50
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,682
No, that's okay.

51
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,417
I mean, it's just like they can't move.

52
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,350
-I'm from Orlando, Florida.
-From Australia.

53
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,795
-I'm from Houston, Texas.
-I just moved here on Monday.

54
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,059
I took the Fung Wah Express last night.

55
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,930
I got here yesterday.

56
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,438
I started dancing... Oh, man.

57
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,269
-Since I was four years old.
-Six years old.

58
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,331
I was about nine.

59
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,004
My mom put me in dance when I was...
Couldn't even talk yet.

60
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,311
We're actually going to start with the jazz
combination, character shoes. Okay?

61
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,010
Great, thank you.

62
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,519
I was raised in New Jersey, in Parsippany.

63
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,722
-Mom, I'm ready.
-Okay.

64
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,093
My mom got me into dance when I was three.

65
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,000
When she first saw Chorus Line,
she knew that it was a show

66
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,097
That would be really right for me,
that I could really identify with.

67
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,701
I remember always being in my room,
kind of rehearsing.

68
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,679
Always rehearsing, always practicing,
always getting ready,

69
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,615
Because I knew this is what I wanted to do
since I was little.

70
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,744
As soon as I got out of school, every day,
that's what I wanted to do.

71
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,722
Not go to the movies with my friends.
My life would always be dance.

72
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,526
I got to class and had it made

73
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,688
And so I stayed
The rest of my life

74
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,760
All thanks to Sis
Now married and fat

75
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,396
I can do this

76
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,838
That I can do

77
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,340
I can do that

78
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:08,055
This whole thing with Chorus Line,
it's insane, 'cause it's here now.

79
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,286
I knew from the beginning

80
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,422
That I was gonna put all my eggs
in this basket

81
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,956
And work as hard as I can to get to here,

82
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,435
And that's why I think I'm here,

83
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,665
'Cause I didn't have anything to fall back on.

84
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:25,434
I feel like if you have something
to fall back on, you'll fall back.

85
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,073
I'd been talking to Donna a while ago
about an idea that I had for a show.

86
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,212
Michael called me and said,
"Will you come with me?

87
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,719
"I'm getting a group together,

88
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,750
"And we're going to talk about
what it's like to be in show business."

89
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:48,092
Then we'd go into this other room,
and we'd just sit down with reel-To-Reel track

90
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:52,001
And a big jug of wine, red wine. Terrible.

91
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:57,771
And we sat in this big circle,
and Michael started.

92
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,211
And what it is, is a group like we are.

93
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,278
Came to New York from various places.
We've been to Broadway shows.

94
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,850
But I want to tape it because
what I want to do is really like an interview.

95
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:15,360
It's really about examining
a group of people in this society.

96
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,327
First, you're gonna learn
the opening number.

97
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,561
Feet together.
Hand on the shoulder goes out, one.

98
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:27,639
Under the armpit, two. Elbow down, up, five,
and hook it in the back, six.

99
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,368
Push on the pelvic bone and lean back.

100
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,775
Down three, four,
squeeze it all the way down.

101
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,440
Passe allemande. Lunge and hook on six.

102
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,007
Don't do that. I know that's Cats.
Don't be doing that.

103
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:43,920
I know what show you did if you do this.
Five, six and one, two, three, four.

104
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,959
Left and turn and left and turn
and left and turn.

105
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,324
You know the term, "Eat nails"?

106
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:56,964
That's, you know, doing this combination,
you've got to really eat nails, okay?

107
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:01,939
And get down! Come on, get down.
A five, a six, a five, six, seven.

108
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,637
And one, two, three, four, five, six,
left, right,

109
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,613
Ieft, right, left, walk, step, hook and turn.

110
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,015
And one, two, three and four.
Dance in step, now turn.

111
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,781
Two, three, four, five and turn.

112
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:20,018
And step, step, kick, kick and chalet.

113
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,728
Turn, roll, step, baby step. Two.

114
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,127
Turn, roll, step, baby step. Two.

115
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,663
I met Michael Bennett...

116
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,058
He came to my dancing school
at 13 years old.

117
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:34,406
And then years later, Michael announced
that he wanted to start teaching,

118
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,100
And I started taking his class.

119
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,704
And then he told us that he wanted
to become a choreographer.

120
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:46,182
From the beginning, we knew
that Michael was somebody special.

121
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,687
First of all, in the way he danced.
There was a freedom.

122
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:58,028
I first met Michael on Hullabaloo,
bringing the jerk to new heights, you know.

123
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,273
I said, "Michael, what do you want to do
when you grow up?

124
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,866
"You can't keep doing this
the rest of your life."

125
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,878
And he said,
"I'm going to be a choreographer."

126
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:18,244
I first met Michael Bennett when we were
doing a European tour of West Side Story.

127
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,884
Michael was brought in
as the new Baby John,

128
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,081
And he was 16 years old.

129
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,750
I left school early in my junior year.

130
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,851
I got a telegram that said,
"Please come to New York.

131
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,864
"Jerome Robbins is auditioning people for
the European company ofWest Side Story."

132
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,991
And I went to my locker
and I took everything out,

133
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,695
And I walked out the door, and I left.

134
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,039
And I got on a bus for New York, and I said,

135
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:45,339
"I am not coming back. I am getting this job.
I am never coming back. "

136
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,105
Michael had tremendous ambition.

137
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:55,347
He knew he wanted to be a choreographer
from the get-Go, from the time he was a kid.

138
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,981
And the kid had a great brain,

139
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,993
And for some reason,
he always treated me like an older brother.

140
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:05,053
And we were best friends ever since.

141
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:11,203
Bobby, you know, was Michael's
creative partner for his entire career.

142
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,800
And the director of A Chorus Line,
Mr. Bob Avian.

143
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,943
So everybody in here is new
for the first time.

144
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,504
Well, welcome, everybody.
Thanks so much for coming today.

145
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,607
So Baayork's going
to teach you the combination

146
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,279
From the opening of the show,
so try and have a good time.

147
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,481
Casting always is the biggest challenge.

148
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:35,220
Just finding those people
and trying not to duplicate the original cast.

149
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,423
The roles, however, are very specific.

150
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,933
They corner you,
in terms of their age and their ethnicity,

151
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,561
And it's difficult to veer too much.

152
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,832
You know,
I just want to thank you all for coming today.

153
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,238
We're doing the first elimination down.

154
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,243
So, if I call your name,
you're gonna do the ballet.

155
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:57,271
Brian, Chris Klink, Eric, Cornelius and Seth.

156
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,115
Of the ladies that just went in,
you're all excused. Thank you very much.

157
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,678
You've been cut. Can you please get out?

158
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:08,352
And they just made a cut,
and I'm still here, so I survived.

159
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:14,822
Balance, pas de bourree, step, step,
jete, contretemps and hold.

160
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,800
Pirouette, step, two, two and hold.

161
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,274
One more time.

162
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,059
Guys, this is the tough part.

163
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,000
God, I really blew it, I really blew it

164
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,766
We're cutting down a little bit further,
but you're really all terrific.

165
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,104
Now I'll never make it! I'll never make it!

166
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,905
He doesn't like the way I look
He doesn't like the way I dance

167
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:07,081
They made a cut. Unfortunately, I didn't
make it, but they're gonna keep on dancing.

168
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,745
Eat nails.

169
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,110
It's also what slots we see you in.

170
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:42,143
They're all very defined, you know.
So I want to thank you all for coming,

171
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,018
-And Jay will read out your names.
-Okay, good.

172
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,249
Thank you.

173
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,157
May I see the following people?

174
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,420
God, I think I've got it
I think I've got it

175
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,830
Kieran Giovanni, Deirdre, Rachelle,

176
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,770
Nadine, Natascia, Charlotte, Yuka Takara,
J. Elaine Marcos.

177
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,799
-Jason Tam.
-Miss Alisan Porter and Miss Meredith,

178
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:10,179
Nikki Snelson, Chryssie, Tyce Diorio,
and Jessica Lee.

179
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,410
The rest of you, thank you very much.

180
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,887
Good news.

181
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,720
Thank you.

182
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:30,101
I need this show

183
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,541
-Yeah, he's doing the ballet now.
-Okay, good.

184
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,581
-Yeah, but you didn't see them do the jazz.
-I didn't see anything though.

185
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,742
-Okay.
-I had to leave right away.

186
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:49,220
-Okay, John. It's okay, sweetie. Okay.
-No, I trust you. I trust you guys. I trust you.

187
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:56,061
As the field whittled from thousands
to hundreds, things became trickier.

188
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,321
-Anybody Jewish around here?
-Why?

189
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,695
-Are you Jewish?
-Why?

190
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,563
I've got a name to read.
I don't know how to say it.

191
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,765
We start at 1 1 :00.
Last appointment, right now.

192
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,438
-Yokov? Yokov?
-Yeah.

193
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,477
Okay, great. Thanks.

194
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,445
Make your time for you to work with people
if you wanted to get up,

195
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,379
You to get up and play with people.

196
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:24,484
Rochmel Lev Ben Yokov...

197
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,454
Yokov Meyer Beckenstein.

198
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,790
Tomorrow we start at 10:00.
Cassies, Vals, Sheilas.

199
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,093
-And they're dancing at 10:00 first?
-They're dancing at 10:00.

200
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,633
-Okay. We should be able to go on this now.
-Yeah.

201
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:49,811
That's the story of my life
I remember when everybody was my size

202
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,641
Boy, was that great.
But then everybody started moving up,

203
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,849
And there I was, stuck at 4'10".

204
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,256
Do I get a chance to say
who I want to play my life? No.

205
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,954
-Yes, you do.
-No.

206
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,528
-So let's hit it.
-Okay. Tell me your name, stage name.

207
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,534
It has always been Baayork Lee.

208
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,834
Mother and father from two different
backgrounds and religions,

209
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,876
Buddhist and Muslim. Mucho conflict.

210
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,276
Born in New York City,
Lower East Side. Ghetto.

211
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:27,042
That night, that 24 hours, all the stories
came out of that first tape session.

212
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:32,785
The man upstairs was a dancing teacher,
and he saw something.

213
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,756
He said I was gonna be a ballerina.

214
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:43,533
So I was going to the School of
American Ballet to become a prima ballerina.

215
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:49,866
I just wanted to dance. But I never grew.
That was my problem. I never got any taller.

216
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,409
I used to hang from the parallel bars
by the hour,

217
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,447
Hoping I'd stretch just an inch more,

218
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,489
'Cause I was into dancing then,
and I was good.

219
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,424
And I wanted so much
to grow up to be a prima ballerina.

220
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,566
It's always hard for the girls,
'cause I'm sitting there

221
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,158
And I'm demanding so much from them.

222
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,236
-Ls she American born?
-Hey, Yuka?

223
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,033
-Yes?
-Where were you born?

224
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,870
-I'm from Okinawa, Japan.
-How long have you been here?

225
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,036
-Since '98.
-'98. Yeah, okay.

226
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:31,378
I'm going to work on Yuka's
American accent, which I know she can get.

227
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,083
There's something about
being born in America

228
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:37,953
-And fighting, at five years old, for a seat.
-Fighting for a...

229
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,253
-A seat on the F train.
-A seat on the...

230
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,622
-Okay.
-You know what I'm saying?

231
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:45,789
I was really nervous at the audition
because she was right there at the table,

232
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:51,166
And it was just nerve-Wracking, you know,
'cause she is Connie.

233
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,764
-Hey, you? Ten.
-Ten!

234
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,236
-Ten.
-Ten.

235
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,277
-Good. Dancing.
-Dancing!

236
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,747
There you go. Get out of here. Yeah.

237
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,646
I went to an agency

238
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,419
And they keep typecasting me

239
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,821
Yes, I'm Asian. I came from Saigon

240
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:17,055
But on Broadway I even played a blonde

241
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,063
I got more in me

242
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,361
And you can set it free

243
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,862
I can play any role that I can

244
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,568
Even Afro-American
Remember my name, Elaine

245
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,873
-Did you like her as Connie?
-I want her as Connie.

246
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,040
You want her as Connie.
She gets your vote, huh?

247
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,708
She gets my vote.

248
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:43,744
We started to bond,
and a lot of things started to come out.

249
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,650
Michael was very clever.

250
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:52,027
He would reveal something about himself
that nobody had ever heard or knew,

251
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:56,591
Myself included,
and it was kind of provocative

252
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,766
And touching and shocking.

253
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,202
We are in Israel rehearsing West Side Story.

254
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:09,213
For some reason, I ended up
on the roof of this hotel with Grover alone.

255
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,307
And the last thing I wanted to happen
was to get involved with Grover.

256
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,615
He opened certain doors
about his own privacy

257
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,155
And his own sexuality
and his own teenage angst.

258
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,953
Grover says, "Would you like a cigarette?"

259
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,053
Tries to light it and it keeps going out.

260
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,529
And he said,
"Would you like some brandy?"

261
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,031
And it's about 5:00 in the afternoon.

262
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,297
For me, I'm thinking
that's very early for brandy.

263
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:38,636
I remember saying, "I'm very sorry, but... "
and running.

264
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,139
Running and running down 13 floors
of this hotel's stairway

265
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,876
'Cause I'm gonna be straight!

266
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,416
And it was like he was saying,

267
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,444
"Okay, I give you permission now
to speak from your heart."

268
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,218
I was very effeminate as a child and I had...

269
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,123
I kept feeling her boobs.

270
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,128
She said,
"Don't you want to touch anything else?"

271
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,959
And I said, "No, I really don't. "

272
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,864
I really spray-Painted one boy silver.

273
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:06,665
As far as my tits are concerned,
that's the best thing I've ever done.

274
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,000
Good God!

275
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,140
As I was watching

276
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,206
Dancers just talk about Broadway
and their lives,

277
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,885
I began to hear musical numbers.
So Marvin, being a dance arranger,

278
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:25,014
For me, was the ideal person
to write this musical about dancers.

279
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,686
I had worked with Michael Bennett prior,
just as a dance music arranger,

280
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,229
And I thought this guy was a genius.

281
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:37,564
Now, I had gotten myself out to Hollywood
basically because that's where the work was.

282
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:41,697
And here I was receiving three
Academy Awards, couldn't believe it.

283
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:46,301
And about four or five weeks later
I get a phone call from this genius.

284
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,439
And the genius says that he wants me
to come back to New York now,

285
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:56,210
'Cause he has an idea for a show,
and he wants me to just drop everything.

286
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,653
Now, you can imagine.

287
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,419
I go to my agent and say,
"You know, now that we're at the top,

288
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:04,792
"And we can really field all the great offers,
I'm leaving," you know,

289
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,763
And then we'd have to revive him for a while.

290
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,197
So he tells me the following.

291
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,727
"I've been talking to a lot of chorus kids,
and I have these tapes.

292
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,533
"And these tapes are just them talking,

293
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,404
"And I have slowly but surely
had them typed out,

294
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:21,412
"And I want you to read these tapes because
I think that there's something in this. "

295
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,278
I come from a school of beginning,
middle and ends, right,

296
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,308
So I'm going, "Yes, and?"
"No, that's it. That is it."

297
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,287
So he has all these tapes, and he sat there
and said, "What is this thing?"

298
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,823
But he knew, the most important thing,
he knew it was going to take a long time.

299
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,922
And there came the great man, Joe Papp.

300
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,765
I mean, that was where
Michael found his genius producer.

301
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:49,239
And Joe said, "Okay, you've got the space.
Everybody makes $100 a week.

302
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,506
"That's the cast, you guys, the writers,
you name it."

303
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:57,036
And I said, "Michael, $100 a week,
how can we do this?"

304
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,644
And he said, "It's worth it.

305
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,048
"We're just going to gamble.
We're going to do it."

306
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,348
And I went, "Okay," as I've always done.

307
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,787
And we spent the summer in my apartment

308
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,791
Writing what amounted
to something like that.

309
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:17,267
This was the period in which people
wrote a show, went out of town,

310
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,362
Either had a hit, had a miss,
whatever, that was it.

311
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,270
There was no such thing as a workshop.

312
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,868
This was the first time
the workshop device had been used.

313
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,936
Michael, in a sense, created it with Joe Papp.

314
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,714
We did a first run-Through
in our first workshop

315
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,776
Where we had, like, one song at that point.

316
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,652
We refer to that day
as the Day of the Towering lnferno.

317
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:42,182
I mean, it was the most overdramatic,

318
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,331
-Melodramatic, indulgent...
-Lndulgent.

319
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:51,394
It was quite awful and really boring,
after all, because you could see,

320
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,906
Okay, we're only on four now,
and we've got how many?

321
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:59,273
One person steps out of the line
and tells you the story of his life,

322
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,472
And you look down the line and you go,
"Oh, my God, 16 more to go."

323
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,344
We were going to be in trouble.

324
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:10,582
So we decided on this kind of montage,
framed by Hello 13, Hello 14, Hello Love.

325
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:16,219
So when it's over, you'll have gotten,
in 15 minutes, what would have taken hours.

326
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,161
Hello twelve

327
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,665
Hello thirteen

328
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,066
Hello love

329
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,999
Changes, oh!

330
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,598
Down below

331
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:34,338
Up above

332
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:41,711
Then we took a break and edited it down
and added a few more songs.

333
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,154
So now comes the second workshop,

334
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,588
And in the second workshop,
things really start to come together.

335
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,129
We were doing something downtown.

336
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,460
Don't tell anybody
what we're doing downtown.

337
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:59,630
We were not supposed to tell, you know,
our boyfriends or spouses or anything.

338
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:04,937
But there was such a buzz around New York
that things were going on downtown.

339
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:09,341
The first song they wrote
on our second workshop was At The Ballet.

340
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,211
And we were all sitting there,
and it was like,

341
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:17,085
I knew that this was going to be
a great thing to be in, a great show.

342
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,515
We always talk about
where the heart and soul of the show is.

343
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,288
The heart and soul is in At The Ballet.

344
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:27,155
That lyric, that continuum
of three people telling you

345
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:31,263
About their lives, that's where the show
grabs the audience and says,

346
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,031
"Hey, this is important. "

347
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,933
I used to dance around the living room
with my arms up like this.

348
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,946
With my arms up like this.
My fantasy was it was an lndian chief,

349
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:46,745
And he'd say,
"Maggie, do you want to dance?"

350
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,819
And I'd say, "Daddy, I would love to dance."

351
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,416
She said, "You'll be very attractive,

352
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,327
"And you'll be different,
but you are not pretty. "

353
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,090
Different, she said
With a special something

354
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,158
And a very, very personal flair

355
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,828
...my mother, and when I was, like, five,

356
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,533
I remember helping her
dig earrings out of the car.

357
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,075
That I knew, at five...

358
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:15,135
When I was five, I remember my mother
Dug earrings out of the car

359
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,648
I knew that they weren't hers
but it wasn't something you want to discuss

360
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,949
Every time you have to go in
and start all over.

361
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,784
You have to sing again,
you have to dance again.

362
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,120
Everyone on that panel has to agree.

363
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,186
To me, Rachelle Rak is like...

364
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:34,096
If it were the '50s,
she is the classic sort of gypsy.

365
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:38,936
She fell 16 feet into the trap
in The Look of Love, right?

366
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,666
And she got up, she finished the show.

367
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,473
And then she said,
"And now I'm going to the hospital.

368
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,274
"And I'll see you in about two weeks,
and I'll be back."

369
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:52,578
The odds of everyone agreeing,
they are just slim to none.

370
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:57,385
She wanted to be a dancer.
She had all these scholarships and all that.

371
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:02,723
And when she got married, my father
made her give it up. Isn't this exciting?

372
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,927
And then she had this daughter, me,

373
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,826
And she made her
exactly what she wanted to be,

374
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,101
And it was fabulous the way she did it.

375
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:17,141
Am I tall enough? Am I pretty enough?
Am I good enough?

376
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,041
If you went into work every day saying,
"Do you like me?

377
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,944
"Can I do it? Can l...
Am I what you're looking for?"

378
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,845
My mother was raised like a little nun.

379
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,277
She couldn't even go out.
She couldn't even babysit.

380
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,953
Sheila, don't perform. Just talk.

381
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,047
And she made her what she wanted to be.

382
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:37,220
Well, first, she took me to see all the ballets,
and then she gave me her old toe shoes.

383
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,753
And I used to run down the sidewalk
on my toes at five.

384
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,357
And when she saw I really had to dance,
she said...

385
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,595
"You can't do it until you're eight,"

386
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,603
And by then I was only six,
and I just had to scream,

387
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,401
"But I've got to dance."
I mean, anything to get out of that house.

388
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:55,805
But everything was beautiful at the ballet

389
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:02,447
Graceful men lift lovely girls in white

390
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:09,484
Yes, everything was beautiful at the ballet

391
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:13,964
I was happy at the ballet

392
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,638
-You did great. You did great.
-Thanks.

393
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,301
-Lt was very interesting, your choices.
-Thank you.

394
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,402
-I really had a great time. Thank you.
-I really enjoyed it.

395
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,607
-Well, we're glad you came in.
-Okay. Bye. Thanks.

396
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:34,719
She is one of the few people
that understands Sheila. She is Sheila.

397
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,385
-Now, what's your mom's name?
-My mom's name is Laura Klein.

398
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:43,856
-Laura's your mother?
-She loves you, and she loves you, so much.

399
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,887
It's ridiculous.

400
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,190
-I'm speechless.
-And she was a Bebe?

401
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,324
Yeah.

402
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,159
Mother always said I'd be very attractive
when I grew up

403
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,795
When I grew up

404
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,205
Different, she said
With that special something

405
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,301
And a very, very personal flair

406
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,403
Though I was eight or nine

407
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,380
Though I was eight or nine

408
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,584
Though I was eight or nine

409
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,454
I hated her

410
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:18,887
And everyone was beautiful at the ballet

411
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:25,934
Every prince has got to have his swan

412
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,199
Yes, everything

413
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,934
Was beautiful

414
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,944
At the ballet, hey

415
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:41,112
I was pretty at the ballet

416
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,852
Just like her mother.

417
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,322
I can see her doing all the Bebe lines
and being that girl.

418
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,882
"Please, give me a break, you know.

419
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,360
"They told me Broadway was dead
when I got here."

420
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,488
-I can hear her do that.
-Yeah.

421
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:57,193
Everything, everything was...

422
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,097
Everything was, everything was

423
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:06,269
Raise your arms
And someone's always there

424
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:10,305
What makes At The Ballet so moving,
of course, is Maggie's crescendo.

425
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:17,116
At the ballet
At the ballet

426
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:21,147
At the ballet

427
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,223
You don't have to scream it, you know.

428
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:29,434
At the ballet
At the ballet

429
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,678
That's not easy.

430
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:52,586
Everything was beautiful at the ballet

431
00:29:54,759 --> 00:30:01,688
Raise your arms
And someone's always there

432
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:05,461
Yes, everything was beautiful

433
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:09,098
At the ballet

434
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:12,940
At the ballet

435
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:19,974
At the ballet

436
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:26,289
-Good girl, Mara. Very nice job.
-Thank you.

437
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:32,224
Michael said, "That's the score.
That's where I want the score to be.

438
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,791
"I want that kind of originality for the show. "

439
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,200
I want to be Val. I've got the boobs up.

440
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:47,738
Mom in Missouri is going to be so proud
that I just said that.

441
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,303
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm not trained for this.

442
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,576
You know, just do it by ear and have fun.

443
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,780
By the time the character of Val
steps forward and says,

444
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,823
"Well, the day I turned 18,

445
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,484
"L got on a Trailways bus
and headed for the Big, Bad Apple,"

446
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:06,690
You have heard about someone
at four, five, six, seven, eight.

447
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,097
You've heard all the dancers
take you, collectively,

448
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,103
Through childhood, adolescence,
and up to 18.

449
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:17,431
So the day after I turned 18,
I kissed the folks goodbye,

450
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:22,343
Got on a Trailways bus
and headed for the Big, Bad Apple.

451
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:26,940
That was my plan.
New York, New York, here I come.

452
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,883
Val is very difficult.

453
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,514
A lot of people get confused about that role
and they think she's a tough girl.

454
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,559
Let's get one thing straight.
I never heard of The Red Shoes.

455
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:39,586
I never saw The Red Shoes.
I don't give a fuck about The Red Shoes.

456
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,394
She's got a truck-Driver's mouth,

457
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:46,198
But she's really a sweetheart
and a very likable girl.

458
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,131
Except I have one minor problem.

459
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:53,805
-See, I was ugly as sin. I was ugly.
-Skinny.

460
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,573
-Homely.
-Unattractive and...

461
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,844
Flat as a pancake. Get the picture?

462
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,446
Tits and Ass wasn't getting any laughs.
Zero, zero, laughs.

463
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,046
I thought that was one of the funniest songs
I'd ever written,

464
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,490
And the girl was doing it great.

465
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,891
On the third preview, Michael said,

466
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:15,023
"Guys, if we don't fix this pretty soon,
you're gonna have to write another number."

467
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,327
I said, "Michael, you've got to be kidding."

468
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,659
Fixed the chassis

469
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,397
How do you do

470
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,166
Life turned into

471
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,832
An endless medley of, "Gee

472
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,899
"It had to be you. " Why?

473
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,275
-Tits
-And ass

474
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:33,247
Ed and I decided to look at the show
the way the audience did.

475
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,683
It was the first time
that we were handed a program.

476
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,981
We opened the program
and we immediately went, "Whoops!

477
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,754
"Oh, my God!
We're giving away the punch line. "

478
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:48,527
Have it all done
Honey, take my word

479
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,968
Grab a cab
Come on, see the wizard

480
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:57,769
On Park and 73rd

481
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:02,077
For tits and ass

482
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:05,682
Changed the title the next day
to Dance, Ten. Looks, Three.

483
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:10,419
They came to the lyric, "tits and ass,"
it got a laugh.

484
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,519
Tits and ass
Yes, tits and ass

485
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:22,556
Have changed my life

486
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,563
That was horrible. It was horrible.

487
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,372
-Nikki, have you ever played the part?
-No, I never have.

488
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,707
-It's really good.
-Thank you.

489
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,179
-You're really good.
-Thanks a lot.

490
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,217
They're talking about me. I hate that.

491
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,644
This girl's got it.

492
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,054
-She just needs to be, like, guided into it.
-That's all. It's all about pacing and timing.

493
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,149
-Hey, Amanda?
-Yeah?

494
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,490
So, they want you to come back on the 23rd.

495
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,085
-Okay, great, okay.
-Okay.

496
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,824
I got a callback!

497
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,855
Oh, my God, I just yelled that really loud,

498
00:33:55,933 --> 00:34:00,571
And there's somebody else auditioning
for Val. I feel bad. But I got a callback.

499
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:05,131
We're considering you for cover, okay?

500
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,445
-For cover for...
-For cover, right now, for Val,

501
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,947
-And maybe like a second casting cover.
-Okay.

502
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:15,349
If a dancer walks in, and they've got
that special little bit of magic,

503
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,850
You go that way. And if they can bring
something fresh to the role,

504
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:26,761
It's what you're attracted to. I mean,
the likeability factor is very important.

505
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,501
They're, like, "Chryssie,
we're totally in town for A Chorus Line.

506
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,694
"We want to see you for it."
And I was, "Yeah, that's right."

507
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,897
I mean, I totally had forgotten
that they were casting it.

508
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,064
And I was, like, "That's right."

509
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,201
I was, like, "What do you see me as?"
And I usually get... Sorry.

510
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,677
I thought,
"What are you thinking me of, as Judy?"

511
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,771
And she was, "No, actually,
we're thinking of you as Kristine."

512
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,409
And my first reaction was,
"Well, that's the girl that can't sing."

513
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:53,022
In my own little corner
In my own little chair

514
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:57,391
I can be whatever I want to be

515
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:02,665
I'm a slave from Calcutta
I'm a queen in Peru

516
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:06,794
I'm a mermaid dancing upon the sea

517
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,534
That's the most important thing.
You instantly liked her.

518
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,133
-You like her.
-And she's perfect with Tony Yazbeck.

519
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,078
That's always the bottom line thing,
like you said.

520
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,012
It's, you gotta like them right away.

521
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:23,478
It's funny, you know, when you audition,
you play it out in your head 100 times

522
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,318
Of how it could go,
and it never goes that way.

523
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,382
I picked up my foot, touched it
to the back of my head and said,

524
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,552
"This little girl could be a star."

525
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,958
When you're finally out there,
it's like this surreal feeling of,

526
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:40,129
"I'm auditioning right now. It's happening
right now. I'm thinking about my cat.

527
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:44,504
"I'm not thinking about the audition. I have
to focus. Oh, my gosh, what if I get this?

528
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,564
"What if I don't get this?"

529
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,476
There's, like, a million thoughts
going through your head.

530
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,639
Except I had this little...

531
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,077
Problem.

532
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,490
Interesting take, Jennifer. It's wonderful.

533
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,893
My sister would go home
and she would practice her routines

534
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:07,157
Downstairs in the basement,
and I would go down and I'd say,

535
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,826
"I can do that. " She would be working
real hard and I'd say, "I can do that. "

536
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:15,066
The people who are more used to shows
constructed like My Fair Lady,

537
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,074
I Can Do That is a lovely way
to put them at ease and say,

538
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,133
"That's all right.
You're going to see singing and dancing,

539
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,076
"And it's not going to be
a threatening experience."

540
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,073
I can do that

541
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,741
I can do that

542
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,313
Knew every step
Right off the bat

543
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,053
I said, I can do that

544
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,126
I can do that

545
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:42,492
One morning Sis won't go to dance class

546
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,428
I grabbed her shoes and tights and all

547
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,036
But my foot's too small, so

548
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,698
I stuff her shoes with extra socks

549
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,710
Run seven blocks in nothing flat

550
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,542
Hell, I can do that

551
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,548
I can do that

552
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:12,020
I got to class and had it made

553
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:16,158
And so I stayed the rest of my life

554
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,630
All thanks to Sis

555
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,866
Now married and fat

556
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,772
I can do this

557
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:34,041
That I can do
I can do that

558
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,849
That was fun. I did what I wanted to do,
and that's all that matters.

559
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,555
Sometimes nerves take over,
and you don't show them who you are.

560
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:50,363
But that's not what's going on.
That's my party in there, not theirs.

561
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:54,696
They're invited to my party.
For me, it's just, I'm not desperate.

562
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:59,109
My life goes on with or without it.
What's important is the work.

563
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:03,044
I go in that room for those 10 minutes,
I do what I want to do,

564
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,479
And the rest is whatever.

565
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,140
-Hey, Tyce?
-Yes?

566
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,076
They want you to come to callbacks.

567
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:18,492
I made it to the final callbacks.
Yes, for Kristine!

568
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,890
It went so amazing. Sorry!

569
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,302
Nicholas Dante's speech,
the speech that Paul makes

570
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,775
About his parents coming
and seeing him in drag,

571
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,106
Was heart-Stopping that night.

572
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,182
I knew I was gay, and that didn't bother me.

573
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,446
What really bothered me
was I didn't know how to be a boy,

574
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,322
And I used to wish I was a girl.

575
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,848
I started hanging around 42nd Street,
trying to meet friends that were gay,

576
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,760
That I could understand what it was I was.

577
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,993
And somebody told me that
they were looking for male dancers

578
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,035
For the Jewel Box Revue.

579
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:01,170
When Michael heard that, he said,
"I have to use that. "

580
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,871
This was so personal to him, because...

581
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:11,976
He felt all of that shame
of not being able to be honest,

582
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:17,985
Of being judged, self-Critical,
not his own best friend.

583
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:23,988
And he was tired of apologizing for living.

584
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,695
When Nicholas Dante,
the evening of the taped sessions,

585
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:31,462
Told me about his life, which was basically
what is the Paul monologue in the show,

586
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,198
What we call the Paul monologue,
I was so moved.

587
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:40,209
And not only moved by the story,
but moved by the way he expressed himself.

588
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,237
And I went down to audition. And they said,

589
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,647
"Well, you're too short to be a boy,
but would you like to be a pony?"

590
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,153
And I said, "What is a pony?"
And they said, "A girl. "

591
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,079
"You're too short to be a boy.
Would you like to be a pony?"

592
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,821
And I said, "What's that?"
And he said, "A girl."

593
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:02,292
And I said, "Well, what do I have to do?"
And they said, "Show us your legs."

594
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:06,462
"But I have hair on my legs."
"It's okay. Just come on upstairs."

595
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:07,868
So I went.

596
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,968
Well, they hiked up my dungarees

597
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,603
And they put on a pair of nylon stockings
and high heels.

598
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:22,109
And it was so pretty, so incredible.

599
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:23,254
Next to Cassie, probably Paul
is the biggest challenge of casting.

600
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:28,123
Next to Cassie, probably Paul
is the biggest challenge of casting.

601
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,852
I mean, I really wanted to perform.

602
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:35,131
One day my cousin told me,
"You'll never be an actor."

603
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:38,900
And I knew she was saying this
because I was such a sissy.

604
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,698
I don't know. No, he's not for us.

605
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,832
And I knew she was saying this
because I was such a sissy. I mean,

606
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,401
I was terribly effeminate.

607
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,604
Not bad.

608
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,012
I always knew I was gay,
but it didn't bother me.

609
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,883
What bothered me was that
I didn't know how to be a boy.

610
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,921
-Should this be a DTL?
-What is DTL?

611
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,580
-Down the line.
-Down the line.

612
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,181
-Did you make that up?
-It's a biz term.

613
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,158
-That's what we call it. That's what we do.
-That's casting.

614
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:06,560
What bothered me was that
I didn't know how to be a boy.

615
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,598
-This we know is no.
-No.

616
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:15,901
This we know is no. This we know is no.
This we know is no.

617
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,066
We saw so, so many Pauls.

618
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:22,044
And we searched and searched,
and Jason Tam came into the room.

619
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,341
We were doing this oriental number,

620
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:30,147
And I looked like Cyd Charisse.

621
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,418
I mean... No, Anna May Wong.
Anna May Wong.

622
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:38,361
I mean, I had these great big
chrysanthemums on either side of my head,

623
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:42,728
This huge headdress
with gold balls hanging all over it.

624
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,332
I was going on for the finale.

625
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:54,175
I was going down the stairs, and who should
I see standing next to the stage door?

626
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,709
My parents.
You know, they got there too early.

627
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:04,848
I freaked. I didn't know what to do,
you know, so I thought to myself,

628
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:09,782
"L know. I'll just keep walking past them
like all the others

629
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,487
"And they'll never recognize me."

630
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:16,090
And so I take a deep breath
and I walk down the stairs,

631
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:21,802
And just as I pass my mother, I hear her say,

632
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,138
"Oh, my God.

633
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,640
"Paul."

634
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,881
I died, you know, but what could I do?

635
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,785
You know, I had to go on for the finale,
so I just kept going.

636
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,784
After the show, I went to my dressing room,

637
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:45,522
And after I was done dressing
and taking off my makeup,

638
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,030
I went back downstairs.

639
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:54,029
And there they were,
standing in the middle of all of these...

640
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,742
All they said to me was,

641
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,301
"Please write.

642
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:06,507
"Make sure you eat,
and take care of yourself."

643
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,753
And just before my parents left,

644
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,292
My father turned to the producer
and he said,

645
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,295
"Take care of my son."

646
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:29,264
That's the first time he ever called me that.

647
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,176
So that was... That was it.

648
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,413
So I looked at the producer,
and he said, "Take care of my son."

649
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:56,323
That was the first time
he ever called me that.

650
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,055
Boy, you got me.

651
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,364
For an audition, Jesus, that's excellent.

652
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,469
-Okay. Wait outside.
-Thank you.

653
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,774
Thank you.

654
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,481
Oh, my God.

655
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,217
I'm crying.

656
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:56,187
I haven't cried in, what, 30 years.

657
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:58,696
Sign him up.

658
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:07,132
Cassie, stay on stage, please.

659
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,562
Wow!

660
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:15,208
-This audition is really interesting, isn't it?
-Yeah. What are you doing here?

661
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:18,844
-What do you think? I need a job.
-Ln the chorus?

662
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:23,512
Look, Zach, I'd love a part in the chorus,
but I'll take what I can get.

663
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:26,283
You're too good for the chorus, Cassie.

664
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,617
Too good? Wow.

665
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:32,523
I did a couple of dance spots, so...

666
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,928
You were featured.
You stopped two shows cold.

667
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,727
Your career was going fine
here in New York.

668
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,768
I can't get a job, Zach.

669
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:45,100
I definitely feel I've been around enough
to say those lines that Cassie says.

670
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:50,139
I understand being successful
and then not being able to get a job.

671
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,805
It's a role that I've always wanted to play.

672
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:56,717
It's one of the first Broadway shows
that I saw, when I was 1 1 years old.

673
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,984
I ran around as a kid singing
Music and the Mirror.

674
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:06,251
My whole thing is I haven't had my break yet.

675
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:13,234
I want to spend my time
on this Earth dancing.

676
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,596
This is the best part of me,

677
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:19,836
And that's what's resonant
about what Cassie talks about,

678
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:23,271
Because this is me.
When I can do this, I'm me.

679
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:28,643
The selection of the Cassie
is the most difficult role to cast.

680
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,586
I mean, it was built originally
for Donna McKechnie,

681
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:34,749
And it was based on her gifts.

682
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:43,231
Donna McKechnie was such an organic
dancer when it came to the music.

683
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,497
She just could hear it all
and physicalize it all.

684
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:06,949
To find that special gal who could sing
the role and dance the role and act the role,

685
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:11,723
It's a lot of subtle qualities
that you've got to find in one performer.

686
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,963
You just continue gossiping
and schmoozing with each other,

687
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:18,126
And I'm just gonna come around you
one at a time and get to know you

688
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,035
And get to meet you a little bit, okay?
And then Baayork's gonna teach you.

689
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:24,232
But I want to know who you are first,
before we start.

690
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,675
So I'll start with Colleen
'cause we know each other.

691
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,375
-Hi.
-Hi, sweetie. How are you?

692
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,004
-I'm good.
-Come say hello.

693
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,742
-Okay.
-How are you doing?

694
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,751
I'm such a fan. Your work is so amazing.

695
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,344
I saw you in Movin' Out
and, of course, in Fosse.

696
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,913
Nadine, right! I saw you in Paper Mill, right?

697
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,652
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Yeah, you were the Val, right?

698
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:43,715
Yes, I was.

699
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,125
-You replaced Lauren Kennedy...
-I did, yes. Yes.

700
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,560
...in Sunset Boulevard.

701
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,360
Reading this scene,
the scene we have for the sides today,

702
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,424
Was a little too close to home.
Do you know what I mean?

703
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:55,267
You go out to LA and you keep trying
and you keep trying and you keep trying,

704
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,000
And it just kind of eats at your soul.

705
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,270
So you're going through a slow period.
Happens to everyone.

706
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,209
Something will happen.

707
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,943
That's what I kept telling myself
in California.

708
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,744
You didn't work out there?

709
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:11,151
Well, sure. I was a go-Go dancer
in a TV movie of the week.

710
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,348
Let's see, commercials.

711
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:19,796
I almost got to squeeze a roll of toilet paper,
but I lost out in the finals.

712
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:24,224
And I was in California going,
"God, get me out of here."

713
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,065
I needed a real job. "I'm not happy.

714
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:31,065
"L want to work. I want to dance.
I want to sing. I want to act."

715
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,172
I need a job.

716
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:39,208
To have something that I can believe in

717
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,208
To have someone to be

718
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,584
Use me, choose me

719
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,485
I just can't see you
dancing in the chorus, Cassie.

720
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,894
-Why not?
-Listen, if you need some money,

721
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:57,729
-Call my business manager.
-Sure, I need money, who doesn't?

722
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,361
But I don't need a handout. I need a job.

723
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:04,669
I need a job, I don't know how else to say it.
I mean, do you want me to say it again?

724
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:08,802
-No.
-Okay. Fine. I got that far.

725
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,073
Look,

726
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,147
I haven't worked in two years.

727
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:16,951
Not really.

728
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:22,315
There's nothing left for me to do,
so I am putting myself on the line.

729
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,761
Yes, I am putting myself on your line.

730
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,428
I don't want to wait on tables.

731
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,366
What I really don't want to do
is teach other people how to be doing

732
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:34,301
What I should be doing myself.

733
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,339
God, I'm a dancer

734
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,039
A dancer dances

735
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:44,207
-Bravo.
-Very nice, very nice.

736
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:48,343
Natascia, we need to...
Baayork to work with you,

737
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:52,286
So I understand you want to stay today
and work some more later.

738
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:56,183
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

739
00:49:56,259 --> 00:50:01,196
That dance was very, very difficult to get,
so we just started with being.

740
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:06,693
And I didn't come up with the...
The first step he came up with was,

741
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,900
You know, "Do this.
I want this to be very stark and angular."

742
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:15,735
It's like... He said, "You know,
when someone used to do something,

743
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:19,646
"And they're not sure if they can do it?
It's like, I'll just try this."

744
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,207
When you turn around, you're there.

745
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,212
Look.

746
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,320
What happens for a dancer
in front of a mirror

747
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,299
And the sense of identity one gets

748
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,632
When one has grown up
in front of the mirror,

749
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:43,929
To see yourself in the mirror,
that you take that mirror away

750
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,373
And you don't replace it
with eyeballs or applause

751
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:49,344
Or something else to give you
that sense of who you are.

752
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,117
If she doesn't see herself, she feels invisible.

753
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:04,092
She feels so low
that she has to see herself in the reflection.

754
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:18,396
And bend, bend, bend.

755
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,203
Okay.

756
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:26,646
And then you just fall back
as far as you can.

757
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:27,978
-I'm sure it is.
-Okay.

758
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:31,714
Up, up and then...

759
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:35,315
And then you can plie, plie,
plie, plie and drop.

760
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:36,689
There you go.

761
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,251
Do me a favor, when you're down there,
can you switch it to that side?

762
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:40,421
Yeah.

763
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:44,365
-All right. Great, Charlotte.
-Was she the last?

764
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,369
The solo dance number
is tremendously taxing.

765
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:53,174
And it goes on for a long time,
and it's also running the four-Minute mile.

766
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:57,005
Turn, lunge, roll, step, pas de bourree,
one, two, three.

767
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,571
-One, two, three. But this is three?
-Yeah.

768
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:00,877
And one.

769
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:05,778
That's it, girlfriend.

770
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,153
-That's it.
-That's it.

771
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,089
-And you hear it in the accents.
-All right.

772
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:13,994
Okay. Here we go. That is it.
A five, six, seven and...

773
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,597
Turn, lunge, roll.

774
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:37,178
Anybody who says, "l have a right to live
and do what I want to do

775
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,188
"And do what I love,
even if you don't like it,"

776
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,281
Deserves a second chance.

777
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,053
When Cassie didn't get a job,

778
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:46,789
People walked out that night so depressed.
It was horrible.

779
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:51,266
We found out that there was something off
at the end.

780
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:54,235
We didn't know what it was,
but it wasn't right.

781
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:56,829
And it was just always, like, close,

782
00:52:57,374 --> 00:53:00,343
But it wasn't that thing
where you went, "Wow!"

783
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,672
But one day,
Marsha Mason came to the show.

784
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,147
She said to Michael
that she thought it was wrong

785
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:10,118
That Donna McKechnie, in that role,
did not get the job.

786
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,014
Marsha Mason said,

787
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:16,286
"The audience goes against you, Michael,
because the girl has done everything right.

788
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:20,295
"She's given up everything for this job,
and she may be overqualified,

789
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,853
"But she needs the job.

790
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,901
"You're alienating the audience
because you're getting rid of her

791
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,869
"Only because
you have got a problem with her."

792
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:34,207
So Michael, that night, changed the ending
and let Cassie get the job.

793
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,870
Standing ovation from that night on.

794
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:12,340
I would like to not care.
I would like to not care if I am a success.

795
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,276
I mean, I would like to know that,
for instance,

796
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:20,585
If my career should fall apart,
it's gonna be just fine.

797
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,591
Now, I probably can never do that.

798
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,564
No. This is a no. This is a no.

799
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,799
It's just about getting her motor going,
but she can act.

800
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:38,739
-I think he comes off a little young.
-I agree.

801
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:43,040
And as a Mike, he's the right age,
but he doesn't have the top notes.

802
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,910
I don't remember her.

803
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,178
I don't think she sings well enough.

804
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,309
-Judy or Kristine.
-Right.

805
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,854
Yeah, but you know what?
She doesn't have the voice.

806
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:55,687
-Yes. Don't you think?
-She'd be fine as a Sheila.

807
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,575
-Well, that's pretty good.
-Yeah.

808
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,115
-Okay.
-Great.

809
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:24,086
We could do a lot worse.

810
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:26,485
Nice job.

811
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,363
-You're gonna be onstage.
-For the final callout?

812
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,134
They're going to put you up on a line.

813
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,834
-It's hot.
-It's gonna be the, like...

814
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,740
-It's gonna be fun.
-It's gonna be the real deal for a minute.

815
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,642
-They're gonna put you on the line.
-I'm gonna start to cry.

816
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:52,045
-No, no. It's gonna be great.
-I have, like, all day long.

817
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:55,642
If I was going to be on that stage,
I was going to look like I belonged.

818
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,885
-It's the final, final callback.
-Final, final, so I need good shoes.

819
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,947
You've been doing this
for about eight months now?

820
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,890
-Yeah.
-Well, you know,

821
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:08,328
-The likes of Charlotte d'Amboise.
-She'll be there on Monday?

822
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,527
-That's great.
-Yeah, you're up with the big guys now.

823
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,900
I know, it's a little... Surreal.

824
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,997
-Well, it had to happen sometime.
-It's the way it should be, honey.

825
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,336
Broadway!

826
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:24,937
Of course, you see who's up here, honey.
Donna McKechnie.

827
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,882
I know!
She saw a video of me doing the dance.

828
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:32,888
She wrote me a letter
and gave me, like, words of advice.

829
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,981
She was like, "You're a beautiful dancer."

830
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,586
She's like, "Just always remember
that it's not... Don't work.

831
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,425
"Don't show the work, and just enjoy it."

832
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,293
Well, dance, ten
Looks, three

833
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,999
And I'm still on the unemployment
Dancing for my own enjoyment

834
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,269
That ain't it, kid
That ain't it, kid

835
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:57,008
What do I do to prepare for a final callback?

836
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,539
I'm probably gonna chant a little
and dance around my living room.

837
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,418
Good. It looks great.

838
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:07,320
You have to keep shaking your hair out,
though, because it gets wiggy.

839
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:12,018
To have something that I can believe in

840
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,224
To have someone to be

841
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,323
Beautiful.

842
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:23,737
Use me, choose me

843
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,345
Even my acting coach, he said,
"You are so right for this. "

844
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:38,547
I said, "l can't even hear it from anyone,"
because it's so deep

845
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,919
That I don't want it to hurt that bad.
Do you know what I mean?

846
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,823
You know how you just don't?
It's like love, it's like being in love.

847
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,190
You don't want to love someone so much

848
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:46,728
Because you know
it's going to hurt so much.

849
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:55,937
Okay. So tomorrow, you're coming back
at 10:00 at the Broadhurst.

850
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:57,430
Okay?

851
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,738
I'm nothing like Sheila,
but I think that's the fun part

852
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,041
Of being an actress is to find parts of you
that can connect to it

853
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,911
And other parts... Just go and have fun.

854
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:11,011
I need this job
because I'm out of unemployment.

855
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,248
You're out of unemployment?

856
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:17,450
So I really need this job!

857
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:21,526
It's not for the weak of heart,
I'll tell you that right now.

858
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:26,661
You have to... It teaches you to take things
and it teaches you how to live,

859
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,933
Actually, funnily enough,
if you have the stomach for it,

860
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:35,967
Because you have to go in and commit 100%
and be totally passionate about it.

861
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:40,016
Give your everything and risk it not working.

862
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,278
Right now, all of the sudden,
my heart's starting to race again,

863
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,081
-Thinking I'm going to be on the...
-Yeah.

864
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,280
Okay. So I'm at the theater.

865
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:48,821
This is too flimsy.

866
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,587
I called my father and...

867
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,754
Oh, my God,
and I had him say a prayer for me.

868
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,528
And he never... God, this is so stupid.

869
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,194
I've never had my father say a prayer for me.

870
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,764
Usually, I say the prayer,
and I had my dad say it.

871
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:08,834
So I just said, "Dad, I just need you
to say a prayer for me for tomorrow."

872
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:11,244
Like, "Whatever is supposed to be will be."
Because it's all good.

873
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:12,338
I don't even know why I'm crying.

874
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:14,975
I hate that, that I'm doing that
on the camera right now.

875
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,511
I remember my dad,
he just had both knees replaced.

876
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,386
He's a ballet dancer.

877
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:26,955
And I remember him literally, like,
weeping and just saying,

878
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,521
"Oh, my God, you know. I get it.

879
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,397
"L get what it is not to dance anymore."

880
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:39,664
Ask the gymnast, "Is it worth it?", that tore
her shoulder but was in the Olympics.

881
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:46,447
Ask the farmer, who have thick calluses
on their hands, the working-Man hand,

882
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:49,512
"Ls it worth it?" It's a price you pay.

883
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,650
You never know what's the next day.

884
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:58,558
So each night that you go on that stage
is opening night, but it's also closing night.

885
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,230
You don't know for sure.

886
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:04,323
It becomes everything there is, the cosmos.

887
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,699
The hardest thing is when you can't dance.

888
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:11,802
I think I was 40-Something
when that knee went out.

889
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:15,669
It really went out,
and I ended up in the hospital.

890
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:18,737
And you know,
"You're not gonna dance again."

891
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:23,117
That was hard,
because you begin to form who you are.

892
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:26,815
"L am a dancer. I am a dancer."
"Now you can't dance." "Who am l?"

893
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,985
But then I got a phone call
from Balanchine saying,

894
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,085
"When can you get back?"

895
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,188
So I was back onstage six weeks later.

896
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:41,100
And at the end of dancing,
my dance boot was full of blood.

897
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:43,531
-Bye, Daddy.
-All right. You take care.

898
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,267
I'll take care. Yes, I know.

899
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,638
-All right.
-All right.

900
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,677
You're going to take Shelby
and show it to her.

901
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,805
That's another reason why I like
A Chorus Line.

902
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,316
What we did for love.

903
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:35,881
Hi.

904
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:54,132
I just want to say,
you've just done so well to get here,

905
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,701
Because the competition was fierce.

906
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,014
Am I the first one here?

907
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:10,448
Now, today you're going to be nervous.
All I can say is use that.

908
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:12,323
That's what the play is about.

909
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,455
So when you're standing on the stage
and you're dancing

910
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:19,160
And we're checking you out,
take that nervousness onboard.

911
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:23,571
Use it.
Use it as actors, and don't be afraid of it.

912
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:28,838
Let it put you in the right place,
because that's what's going on today.

913
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:30,537
Okay?

914
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:33,639
And I thank you all for being here.
You did great.

915
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:36,378
I've got my fingers crossed for all of you.

916
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,750
All right. Thanks, everybody,
and good luck, okay?

917
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:40,254
Thank you.

918
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:45,625
A one and two, three, four.
Five and six, seven.

919
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,287
Accelerating, one, two...

920
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:54,034
Meredith! Oh, my God. Hello, honey!

921
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,128
We did also grow up together.

922
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,637
Okay, Baayork,
I'm going to count you off, okay?

923
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:06,940
One, a two, a one, two, three, four.

924
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:02,604
The way you get a job on Broadway
is you walk in

925
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,869
And at that particular moment,

926
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:11,479
You are giving an opening night,
finished performance.

927
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:14,072
I was up against my closest friend, Elaine.

928
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:18,749
I was happy that she was there,
but at the same time, it was a battle.

929
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,654
4'10".

930
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:25,293
4'10". That is the story of my life.

931
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:32,222
-I'm sorry. I need to take that one more time.
-Sure.

932
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:41,405
4'10". 4'10". That is the story of my life.

933
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,305
I remember when everyone was my size.

934
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:49,413
But then everyone started moving up.

935
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:54,890
4'10". 4'10". That's the story of my life.

936
01:04:55,491 --> 01:05:00,087
I remember when everybody was my size.
Boy, was that great.

937
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:05,259
But then everybody started moving up,
and there I was, stuck at 4'10".

938
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:11,204
Her enthusiasm and her animation.
She's the most like what the...

939
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:13,672
The physical-Ness
that you used to bring to it.

940
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,904
I'm glad you think I'm cute because I don't.

941
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:17,707
-Of course, I don't see myself that way.
-Right. Right.

942
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,771
-I'm a survivor, you know?
-Right.

943
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,976
It's hard, but...

944
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:27,514
-But I'll be happy either way. Yeah.
-Yeah, either way.

945
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,490
-I'll be... Yeah.
-Yeah.

946
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,556
Now we're really, like, fighting for it now.

947
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:36,229
I think it feels more like, okay,
down to the wire kind of thing.

948
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:37,823
Watch this!

949
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:50,070
He's serious. He's heavy, but very talented.

950
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,970
I got to class and had it made

951
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:57,641
And so I stayed the rest of my life

952
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:00,381
All thanks to Sis

953
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:02,920
Now married and fat

954
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:04,989
I said, I can do this

955
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,092
The beginning is wonderful.

956
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:12,634
I can do this

957
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,309
That I can do

958
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,534
I can do that

959
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:26,606
Beautiful.

960
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:29,082
They said I did a beautiful job.

961
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,988
I think it was Bob Avian who said,
"Beautiful job, Tyce. "

962
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,818
I watched everything
that had dancing on it on television.

963
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:39,520
Especially... Oh, God, every Sunday it was...

964
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:43,195
-Ed Sullivan.
-Right. Ed Sullivan,

965
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:44,562
Every Sunday. Like church.

966
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:47,761
-Every Sunday it was...
-Ed Sullivan

967
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:53,540
Ed Sullivan, every Sunday. Like church.

968
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:56,772
This man, he came around
to my house selling...

969
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,404
Lessons.

970
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,812
And he was a terrific salesman.

971
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:02,112
He put me up against the television set.

972
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,913
-He turned me around...
-Picked up my foot and...

973
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:05,920
-Touched it to the back of my...and said
-Head...

974
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:10,425
-"This little girl could be a star."
-"This little girl could be a star."

975
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,728
I did Fosse here for two and a half years.

976
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:18,289
So I went up to the top floor.
I went to the old dressing room,

977
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,461
And all of a sudden I just started...
My tears started coming.

978
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:25,303
Like just total...
Completely crying, like, thank you, God,

979
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,433
Iike, for... I'm so glad I'm here.

980
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:35,974
But everything was beautiful at the ballet

981
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:43,249
Graceful men lift lovely girls in white

982
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:50,698
Yes, everything was beautiful at the ballet

983
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:57,296
I was happy at the ballet

984
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,909
Good, Rachelle, great.
Just wait in the wings for a second.

985
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:04,204
Okay.

986
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,908
-Lt wasn't here today.
-Lt wasn't there at all.

987
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,210
I would give her an adjustment
and see what she does.

988
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:12,379
Okay.

989
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,824
-I want you to try it again.
-Okay.

990
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:21,795
You made some very different choices today
than you did the last time you read it.

991
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:26,324
You went to a very vulnerable place today
that you shouldn't have.

992
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:30,133
And when you came in last time,
you threw it all away. You were funnier...

993
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,231
-That's fine. Yeah.
-That's the girl I want.

994
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,332
Yeah. Yeah.

995
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:36,708
And he said, "I want you to do
what you did last summer. "

996
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:40,374
I didn't know what I did last summer.
I had broken up with my boyfriend.

997
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:44,146
I had all of this stuff last summer.
It was eight months ago.

998
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,688
And I don't know what I did last summer.

999
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:48,382
-All right. Can we do it again?
-Yeah. Absolutely.

1000
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:51,119
-Okay. Do you need a couple of minutes?
-Yeah, let me take a second.

1001
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,457
-Let me just...
-I'll see someone else and call you back.

1002
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:56,327
-Yeah, why don't you do that?
-Okay, okay.

1003
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,431
All right, Cyrus. I'll be back.

1004
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,001
Sheila, come downstage.

1005
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,168
Closer.

1006
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,011
Can I sit in your lap?

1007
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:14,540
Do you always come on like this?

1008
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:18,815
No, sometimes I'm aggressive.
Actually, I'm a Leo.

1009
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:20,649
What's that supposed to mean?

1010
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:24,625
It means the other 11 months of the year
need to watch out.

1011
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,689
-I'm very strong.
-Maybe too strong.

1012
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:32,332
Am I doing something you don't like?
You told me to be myself!

1013
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:33,959
-Bring it down.
-Bring what down?

1014
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,526
Your attitude.

1015
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:42,601
But everything was beautiful at the ballet

1016
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:50,309
Graceful men lift lovely girls in white

1017
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:56,689
Yes, everything was beautiful at the ballet

1018
01:09:56,759 --> 01:10:03,756
Hey, I was happy at the ballet

1019
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,801
-Good, Deidre.
-Bravo.

1020
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,270
-Thank you.
-You did really good.

1021
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:12,034
-Thanks so much, you guys.
-All right. Take care.

1022
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:13,165
Bye.

1023
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:14,543
Your mind can be really mean to you
about things like this.

1024
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:17,444
Your mind can be really mean to you
about things like this.

1025
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:20,676
Like maybe you're going to be too this
or too that or whatever.

1026
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:23,047
So it's just a matter of trying to zone out
about today.

1027
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:26,948
Let's get one thing straight.
I never heard about The Red Shoes.

1028
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:31,893
I never saw The Red Shoes.
I didn't give a...about The Red Shoes.

1029
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:36,728
Tits and ass
Bought myself a fancy pair

1030
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,962
Tightened up my derriere
Did the nose with it

1031
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:43,493
All that goes with it
Tits and ass

1032
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:49,909
Had the bingo-Bongos done
Suddenly I'm getting national tours

1033
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:54,313
Fixed the chassis
How do you do?

1034
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:58,945
Life turned into an endless medley
Of "Gee, it had to be you"

1035
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:01,421
Why? Tits and ass

1036
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,481
-Am I done?
-I think you are.

1037
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:04,548
-Okay.
-You've done great.

1038
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,094
That's great.

1039
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:11,290
Flat and sassy
I would get the strays and losers

1040
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,535
Beggars really can't be choosers

1041
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,127
That ain't it, kid
That ain't it, kid

1042
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:20,403
Fixed the chassis
How do you do?

1043
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:24,606
Life turned into an endless medley
Of "Gee, it had to be you"

1044
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,843
Why?
Tits and ass

1045
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,141
-That's all we need.
-Okay.

1046
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,413
-Thanks very much.
-Thank you.

1047
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:35,619
She's like the Hollywood starlet
version of her.

1048
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,024
You know what's funny,
is when we were dancing that day,

1049
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:44,031
This blonde girl that I had never seen before
was killing it, just dancing circles.

1050
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:47,466
And I thought, "Who's that girl?
I really hope she's not up for Val. "

1051
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,800
And I went up to her and I said,
"What part are you up for?"

1052
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:53,433
And she's like,
"I'm up for understudying Cassie and Val. "

1053
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,872
So the day after I turned 1 8
I kissed the folks goodbye,

1054
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:02,875
Got on a Trailways bus
and headed for the Big, Bad Apple.

1055
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,586
Because I wanted to be a Rockette.

1056
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:11,149
Yeah, let's get one thing straight.
See, I never heard about The Red Shoes.

1057
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,792
I never saw The Red Shoes.
I didn't give a frig about The Red Shoes.

1058
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:20,597
That was my plan.
New York, New York, here I come.

1059
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:25,268
Life turned into an endless medley
Of "Gee, it had to be you"

1060
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,435
Why? Tits and ass

1061
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:32,571
Where the cupboard once was bare
Now you look and someone's there

1062
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:35,916
You have got them, hey
Top to bottom, hey

1063
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:39,886
It's a gas
Just a dash of silicone

1064
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:44,253
Shake your new maracas and you'll find

1065
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:48,695
Tits and ass can change your life

1066
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:52,700
They sure changed mine

1067
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:57,160
-Do you have a cold today?
-Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1068
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:00,800
-All right.
-It's kind of hard to hear myself today.

1069
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:04,437
-All right, but you did really well, darling.
-Thank you.

1070
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:06,813
It's a cold.

1071
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:23,261
So I'm a little freaked out 'cause I got called
back onstage to do the scene again.

1072
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:26,859
So, I don't know.
Hopefully that's a good sign.

1073
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,403
-Today, you were working it a little hard.
-Okay.

1074
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,803
-Go at it a little easier.
-Okay.

1075
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:37,278
And think of her being a little...
What's the word? Less of a showgirl.

1076
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:39,075
-A little more innocent.
-Okay.

1077
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:42,549
-I don't know if that confuses you.
-No, that's good. I'm from St. Louis.

1078
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:44,108
-Okay. You knew what I meant.
-Yeah.

1079
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:48,948
Oh, yeah, let's get one thing straight.
I never heard about The Red Shoes.

1080
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:53,757
I never saw The Red Shoes.
I didn't give a frig about The Red Shoes.

1081
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:58,061
...you, Radio City and the Rockettes.
I'm going to dance on Broadway.

1082
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,791
Well, dance, ten
Looks, three...

1083
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:04,396
Good. Nicole. Nicole, much better, darling.

1084
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,407
-Yeah, is that more what you're going for?
-Yeah.

1085
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:09,774
-Okay.
-It's more honest, you know. It's...

1086
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:12,780
I was a little schmaltzy and nervesy
this morning, huh?

1087
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:14,247
-But this was good.
-Good.

1088
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:15,476
-Very good.
-Excellent.

1089
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,883
-I'm glad we had this moment again.
-I'm glad I came back.

1090
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,580
-Yeah.
-Excellent.

1091
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,684
What did I do last summer?

1092
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,359
Rack them.

1093
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:32,028
How am I going to repeat what I did,
I can't remember what I did?

1094
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,001
What does he remember that was so great?

1095
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,905
How do I get that back?

1096
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:42,239
That's when you start getting vulnerable.

1097
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:49,179
But she wanted to be a dancer. And she had
all these scholarships and all that.

1098
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:52,778
And when she got married,
my father made her give it up.

1099
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:54,952
Isn't this exciting?

1100
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:59,050
If you start to doubt or question,
you know, you're done.

1101
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:04,356
I couldn't get it back.
I couldn't get back that one day.

1102
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,191
You can't do it until you're eight.

1103
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:13,204
Well, by then, I was only six,
and I said, "But I've got to dance."

1104
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:16,911
Good, Rachelle. Good girl.
You did really good.

1105
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,812
Thank you. Did I get it?

1106
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:24,452
Jay, before you're done, I want to see you.

1107
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,856
When you have tried to have ideas,

1108
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:35,295
And for whatever reason it's not working,
that's when it becomes very frustrating.

1109
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,696
-Yes, Jay?
-I've been castrated, so...

1110
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:41,725
-I was going to say, what did she do?
-She said, "Listen, it's been eight months.

1111
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:44,533
"Tell me now. Did I get it or didn't l?"

1112
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:50,244
And she said, "I'm a big girl. I can take it.
Tell me right now. Did I get it or didn't l?"

1113
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,507
-What'd you say?
-I said,

1114
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:54,378
"It's between you and someone else,"

1115
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:57,907
And she said, "Go find out
who is going to play the part."

1116
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,216
She's not bitchy.
She said, "l just want to know."

1117
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,382
-Just tell her that she didn't get it.
-She didn't get it.

1118
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:03,856
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1119
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:07,660
He's not going to come back alive.

1120
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:10,289
He's going to come back
with an ax in his head.

1121
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:14,358
It's not you. It's just my fate, I guess.

1122
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:18,869
I'm on Broadway, just waiting and anxious.
If you only knew.

1123
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:21,868
-But it's all good.
-All right, then.

1124
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:27,875
Deidre walked onstage
and opened her mouth and there it was.

1125
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:32,649
I got it. No, I got it! I got it!

1126
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:37,525
That was one of the greatest joys
that we had.

1127
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,687
I'm about to piss my pants.

1128
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,696
I should do my laundry.
I should do my laundry,

1129
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:47,599
But I don't want to do my laundry.
I'd rather have a cocktail.

1130
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:58,943
I feel really good.
I woke up feeling good today.

1131
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:03,680
Twenty-Three is a good number for me,
and that's today, January 23rd.

1132
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,487
Cassie, stay onstage, please.

1133
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:21,094
Whenever you audition for any show,
it's never easy.

1134
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:22,193
Maybe... You know what it is?

1135
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:24,802
It's having all those lights on you
on the stage there

1136
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:27,068
'Cause you're not used to that.
You're used to black stage.

1137
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,609
Do I see him?

1138
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,935
I mean, am I talking to him or is it a voice?

1139
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:34,073
You can't really see him.
He's in the back row of the theater.

1140
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,310
So back there,
even though I see you, Michael.

1141
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,353
-Okay. I... I'm fine.
-Do you want me to move?

1142
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,786
No, no. The lights are in my face. It's fine.

1143
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,050
-I mean, I can block you out.
-Yeah.

1144
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:43,216
Okay.

1145
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:46,886
This audition's really interesting, isn't it?

1146
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:49,555
Yeah.

1147
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:56,032
-What are you doing here?
-What do you think? I need a job.

1148
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:01,899
-What do you think? I need a job.
-Ln the chorus?

1149
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:06,071
Zach, I'd love a part, of course.

1150
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:10,517
Look, Zach, I'd love a part, of course,
but I'll take what I can get.

1151
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:15,118
-You're too good for the chorus, Cassie.
-Too good?

1152
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:17,821
I did a couple of dance parts. So what?

1153
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:21,693
You were featured.
You stopped two shows cold.

1154
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:25,795
Your career's going fine around here.

1155
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:29,428
God, you sound like all of my friends,
my fans!

1156
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:35,302
Acting like I'm a star and don't know it,
when the truth is, I never even came close.

1157
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:38,504
And no one has the guts to tell me.

1158
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:43,984
Sure, it would be nice to be a star,
but I'm not. I'm a dancer.

1159
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:48,649
Well, it would be nice to be a star,
but I'm not.

1160
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:52,316
I'm a dancer.

1161
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:56,430
The next section.

1162
01:18:56,498 --> 01:19:00,400
I know this choreography.
I've done it, you know? So I know it.

1163
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,835
It's a question of just letting yourself fly.

1164
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:36,566
Play me the music

1165
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:39,732
Give me a chance to come through

1166
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:42,368
All I ever needed

1167
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,277
Was the music and the mirror

1168
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:51,616
And the chance to dance for you

1169
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:57,118
Give me a job
And you instantly get me involved

1170
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:03,295
If you'll give me a job
Then the rest of the crap will get solved

1171
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:04,925
Put me to work

1172
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,494
You would think that by now
I'm allowed

1173
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:15,305
I'll do you proud

1174
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:25,644
I'll do you proud

1175
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:29,789
Play me the music

1176
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:33,191
Give me the chance to come through

1177
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:35,388
All I ever needed

1178
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:39,331
All I ever needed was music

1179
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:44,629
And the mirror
And a chance

1180
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:48,506
To dance

1181
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:51,540
-You did great today.
-All right.

1182
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:55,310
Thanks, darling. That was great.
Your day is done.

1183
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,579
Thanks for working so hard.

1184
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:03,119
Natascia, you did really well today, darling.
Thanks so much.

1185
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,186
-You were beautiful.
-No, it was horrible.

1186
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,194
-God, please. Please.
-You were so beautiful.

1187
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:10,527
-Well, thanks. So were you.
-You were so beautiful.

1188
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,528
-It's great to see you again.
-Good luck, honey.

1189
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:15,399
We'll see what happens over the next phase.

1190
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:18,928
Yeah. Good luck, Natascia.
I'll speak to you soon.

1191
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:20,668
Do you want to tell her?
You want to go back and tell her?

1192
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:23,711
-All right. You're okay?
-Go back.

1193
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:26,943
-Take care.
-You, too.

1194
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,346
All right.

1195
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:36,790
It was the first time I didn't work,
and I was really sad,

1196
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:40,021
And I thought maybe
I wasn't supposed to do this anymore.

1197
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:43,064
And I even took
one of those aptitude tests, like,

1198
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:45,395
"What should you do
when you grow up" tests.

1199
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:49,131
And it said
you should use your intuition and perform.

1200
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:53,436
And so I get to keep doing it
a little bit longer.

1201
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:56,944
And I love it. It feels great. It just feels great.

1202
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,109
Hello? Hello?

1203
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,014
Yes.

1204
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,018
Yes.

1205
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:20,456
Hi, my darling.

1206
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,526
Hi. I have good news for you.

1207
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:23,866
Great. Let me sit down.

1208
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,998
-Yuka's getting the offer for Connie.
-Shut up!

1209
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:27,063
Yep!

1210
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,234
I'm a yep.

1211
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:34,308
I had a great audition for Chorus Line.

1212
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:36,881
I did what I did. I grew this much.

1213
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:38,380
Tyce isn't getting it.

1214
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:41,422
Tyce kind of melted down a little bit, frankly.

1215
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:45,949
His dancing yesterday was really wild.
His ego, it was out of control.

1216
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:50,430
I want my own show. I want to be
on a soap opera. I want a record deal.

1217
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:52,022
I want to do so many things.

1218
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,501
I see myself walking up some stairs
receiving an award somewhere.

1219
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:58,266
I try to just imagine
all these great things, you know?

1220
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,570
Everyone's doing it. Everyone's doing it.

1221
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,974
So many people are in show business.
How did they all get there?

1222
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,342
There's room for more. Why not?

1223
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:09,743
Mama?

1224
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:17,046
So, they just took me, like out, out.
You know, outside, after, you know,

1225
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:19,093
To tell me something.

1226
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:21,654
And I got the job!

1227
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:25,965
That's why I couldn't let you leave.

1228
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,327
We really liked you. We were gonna call you,

1229
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:32,100
But we figured we'd better let you know now.
Anyway, congratulations.

1230
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:34,038
Thank you so much.

1231
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:51,223
Thank you. Thank you.

1232
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:59,693
She's playing the role.
She's playing the role!

1233
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:01,929
Man, you know, I'm going to run
and kiss you right now.

1234
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:04,972
-Well, you should 'cause I'm pretty fabulous.
-Are you kidding me?

1235
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,634
-No, I'm telling you the truth.
-I think I'm gonna cry.

1236
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:10,141
I know. You sound like you're gonna cry.

1237
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:22,954
It's important
because it's a story about dancers

1238
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:25,458
And what we go through every day.

1239
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:29,527
And the stress
and what problems we have, you know.

1240
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:32,861
And dealing with it and living with it.

1241
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:39,330
And not regretting it
and just living our lives.

1242
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:46,281
I think that's why this work is so important,
'cause it's the truth.

1243
01:24:56,257 --> 01:25:00,421
It's one of those things probably
for the rest of my life that I won't get over.

1244
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:03,530
It's that one job that you've always wanted.

1245
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:11,502
I'll see you in a minute.
I'm gonna get changed. All right. Bye.

1246
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:14,508
You'd better look in the mirror,
and you'd better like yourself

1247
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:16,669
Because they're not gonna like you
all the time.

1248
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,742
There are going to be 100 nos to one yes.

1249
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,939
-Where's your picture?
-My picture's right there.

1250
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:22,039
See, right there?

1251
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,778
I'm still waiting for my break.

1252
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:29,017
I'm still... I'm still waiting to have my chance,

1253
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:32,821
To come out and be the lead on Broadway.

1254
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:39,529
And I know that's gonna happen.
I just... I know it's gonna happen.

1255
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,822
Well, sure, I can do terrific fan kicks,
but they weren't good enough.

1256
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:06,657
Of course, he was trying to tell me it was
the way I looked and not the fan kicks.

1257
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:10,892
So I said, "Fuck you,
Radio City and the Rockettes.

1258
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:12,728
"I'm gonna dance on Broadway."

1259
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:17,165
Well, we finally made it to the big night,
opening night on Broadway.

1260
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:19,866
God, I never thought it would happen.

1261
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:05,945
It's about us. It's about what we do.
It's about the hard work it takes.

1262
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,282
It takes your guts. It takes your soul.

1263
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:11,149
But you're willing to give it.

1264
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:18,091
One singular sensation
Every little step she takes

1265
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:24,867
One thrilling combination
Every move that she makes

1266
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:32,070
One smile and suddenly nobody else will do

1267
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:38,684
You know you'll never be lonely
With you know who

1268
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:45,386
One moment in her presence
And you can forget the rest

1269
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:52,161
For the girl is second best to none, son

1270
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:59,105
Ooh! Sigh! Give her your attention
Do I really have to mention?

1271
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:03,109
She's the... She's the...

1272
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:06,635
On my God, I'm on Broadway?
That's all I could say on that stage.

1273
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:07,976
I did it.

1274
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:13,452
...the one!

1275
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:17,822
It's his masterpiece. I think he'd be thrilled.

1276
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:20,452
I think he'd say,
"Thanks, Bob, for doing it again."

1277
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:35,271
I really wanted this.

1278
01:28:36,844 --> 01:28:42,009
And so many people
did so much to help me get this,

1279
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:45,917
And not only Joe Papp
and Marvin and Ed and Nick

1280
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:49,081
And Jimmy and Bobby
and the nine orchestrators,

1281
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:53,355
And Bobby Thomas and the cast
and my darling Donna McKechnie,

1282
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:57,865
But everybody that I've had the opportunity
to work with in the theater.

1283
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:03,029
I mean, they've all taught me things,
and I only wanted one thing.

1284
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:05,664
To be a Broadway director, and I am.

1285
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:09,198
And I wanted one moment and I have it,
and I thank you.

1286
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:23,780
I am very grateful that you have come
to spend this kind of time.

1287
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:29,524
I think that we're all pretty interesting,
and that all of you are pretty interesting.

1288
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:33,222
And I think that maybe
there's a show in there somewhere

1289
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:37,294
Which would be called A Chorus Line.
