I really want to talk about us.



Now, I don't know whether anything
will come of this.



Or whether there is anything in this.



I think we're all pretty interesting,
and that all of you are pretty interesting.



And I think that maybe
there's a show in there somewhere,



Which would be called A Chorus Line.



Five, six, seven, eight.



Okay. Let's do the ballet combination
one more time.



Boys and girls, do it together.
Don't kill yourselves.



Mark. A one, two, three, four, five, six.



Good, and...



Boys in the back, like that.
Round and round. Back to back.



Number nine. Number 10. Number 23.



It's numbers 15 through 22,
and my two ladies.



Forty-Five. Sixty-Three.



Number 75.



Everybody else, thanks a lot, guys.



Cassie.



I need you to sign in, get a dance card.
Remember your number.



What's going to happen
when you go upstairs.



Is we're going to go in in groups of 10.
We're going to do a double pirouette.



All we're looking at right now
is technique and type.



And then you're going to stay
or you're gonna go.



If you get kept,
there's a lot more dancing to be done.



But I just need you guys to be ready
as quickly as possible



So we can just sort of bang it out.



And then you can move on
with the rest of your life today, okay?



-Thank you.
-Thank you, ladies.



A Chorus Line, I think,
is every performer's story.



You understand them.



They're funny. They're real.



It's like the history of the dancer in theater.



A Chorus Line just stands
for what classic Broadway is.



I would love to sing Tits and Ass.



The whole show
is an audition for a chorus line,



And that's basically what we're doing now



In the whole audition process.



Every actor, everybody, thinks of that song,
God, I Hope I Get It,



Every time they go to an audition.



To begin auditions, we saw everybody.



First, we saw professionals. Actors,
Equity members who carried a union card.



And second,
we saw non-Equity, non-Professionals



Trying to get on Broadway for the first time.



Three thousand people
auditioned for the show.



If you said on your resume
that you could dance,



We basically saw you
at some point in the process.



Typically, it's not this busy, I don't think,
at open calls.



Yeah, this is the biggest one I've been to.



That holding room is great.
You should take a look. It's just like...



No, that's okay.



I mean, it's just like they can't move.



-I'm from Orlando, Florida.
-From Australia.



-I'm from Houston, Texas.
-I just moved here on Monday.



I took the Fung Wah Express last night.



I got here yesterday.



I started dancing... Oh, man.



-Since I was four years old.
-Six years old.



I was about nine.



My mom put me in dance when I was...
Couldn't even talk yet.



We're actually going to start with the jazz
combination, character shoes. Okay?



Great, thank you.



I was raised in New Jersey, in Parsippany.



-Mom, I'm ready.
-Okay.



My mom got me into dance when I was three.



When she first saw Chorus Line,
she knew that it was a show



That would be really right for me,
that I could really identify with.



I remember always being in my room,
kind of rehearsing.



Always rehearsing, always practicing,
always getting ready,



Because I knew this is what I wanted to do
since I was little.



As soon as I got out of school, every day,
that's what I wanted to do.



Not go to the movies with my friends.
My life would always be dance.



I got to class and had it made



And so I stayed
The rest of my life



All thanks to Sis
Now married and fat



I can do this



That I can do



I can do that



This whole thing with Chorus Line,
it's insane, 'cause it's here now.



I knew from the beginning



That I was gonna put all my eggs
in this basket



And work as hard as I can to get to here,



And that's why I think I'm here,



'Cause I didn't have anything to fall back on.



I feel like if you have something
to fall back on, you'll fall back.



I'd been talking to Donna a while ago
about an idea that I had for a show.



Michael called me and said,
"Will you come with me?



"I'm getting a group together,



"And we're going to talk about
what it's like to be in show business."



Then we'd go into this other room,
and we'd just sit down with reel-To-Reel track



And a big jug of wine, red wine. Terrible.



And we sat in this big circle,
and Michael started.



And what it is, is a group like we are.



Came to New York from various places.
We've been to Broadway shows.



But I want to tape it because
what I want to do is really like an interview.



It's really about examining
a group of people in this society.



First, you're gonna learn
the opening number.



Feet together.
Hand on the shoulder goes out, one.



Under the armpit, two. Elbow down, up, five,
and hook it in the back, six.



Push on the pelvic bone and lean back.



Down three, four,
squeeze it all the way down.



Passe allemande. Lunge and hook on six.



Don't do that. I know that's Cats.
Don't be doing that.



I know what show you did if you do this.
Five, six and one, two, three, four.



Left and turn and left and turn
and left and turn.



You know the term, "Eat nails"?



That's, you know, doing this combination,
you've got to really eat nails, okay?



And get down! Come on, get down.
A five, a six, a five, six, seven.



And one, two, three, four, five, six,
left, right,



Ieft, right, left, walk, step, hook and turn.



And one, two, three and four.
Dance in step, now turn.



Two, three, four, five and turn.



And step, step, kick, kick and chalet.



Turn, roll, step, baby step. Two.



Turn, roll, step, baby step. Two.



I met Michael Bennett...



He came to my dancing school
at 13 years old.



And then years later, Michael announced
that he wanted to start teaching,



And I started taking his class.



And then he told us that he wanted
to become a choreographer.



From the beginning, we knew
that Michael was somebody special.



First of all, in the way he danced.
There was a freedom.



I first met Michael on Hullabaloo,
bringing the jerk to new heights, you know.



I said, "Michael, what do you want to do
when you grow up?



"You can't keep doing this
the rest of your life."



And he said,
"I'm going to be a choreographer."



I first met Michael Bennett when we were
doing a European tour of West Side Story.



Michael was brought in
as the new Baby John,



And he was 16 years old.



I left school early in my junior year.



I got a telegram that said,
"Please come to New York.



"Jerome Robbins is auditioning people for
the European company ofWest Side Story."



And I went to my locker
and I took everything out,



And I walked out the door, and I left.



And I got on a bus for New York, and I said,



"I am not coming back. I am getting this job.
I am never coming back. "



Michael had tremendous ambition.



He knew he wanted to be a choreographer
from the get-Go, from the time he was a kid.



And the kid had a great brain,



And for some reason,
he always treated me like an older brother.



And we were best friends ever since.



Bobby, you know, was Michael's
creative partner for his entire career.



And the director of A Chorus Line,
Mr. Bob Avian.



So everybody in here is new
for the first time.



Well, welcome, everybody.
Thanks so much for coming today.



So Baayork's going
to teach you the combination



From the opening of the show,
so try and have a good time.



Casting always is the biggest challenge.



Just finding those people
and trying not to duplicate the original cast.



The roles, however, are very specific.



They corner you,
in terms of their age and their ethnicity,



And it's difficult to veer too much.



You know,
I just want to thank you all for coming today.



We're doing the first elimination down.



So, if I call your name,
you're gonna do the ballet.



Brian, Chris Klink, Eric, Cornelius and Seth.



Of the ladies that just went in,
you're all excused. Thank you very much.



You've been cut. Can you please get out?



And they just made a cut,
and I'm still here, so I survived.



Balance, pas de bourree, step, step,
jete, contretemps and hold.



Pirouette, step, two, two and hold.



One more time.



Guys, this is the tough part.



God, I really blew it, I really blew it



We're cutting down a little bit further,
but you're really all terrific.



Now I'll never make it! I'll never make it!



He doesn't like the way I look
He doesn't like the way I dance



They made a cut. Unfortunately, I didn't
make it, but they're gonna keep on dancing.



Eat nails.



It's also what slots we see you in.



They're all very defined, you know.
So I want to thank you all for coming,



-And Jay will read out your names.
-Okay, good.



Thank you.



May I see the following people?



God, I think I've got it
I think I've got it



Kieran Giovanni, Deirdre, Rachelle,



Nadine, Natascia, Charlotte, Yuka Takara,
J. Elaine Marcos.



-Jason Tam.
-Miss Alisan Porter and Miss Meredith,



Nikki Snelson, Chryssie, Tyce Diorio,
and Jessica Lee.



The rest of you, thank you very much.



Good news.



Thank you.



I need this show



-Yeah, he's doing the ballet now.
-Okay, good.



-Yeah, but you didn't see them do the jazz.
-I didn't see anything though.



-Okay.
-I had to leave right away.



-Okay, John. It's okay, sweetie. Okay.
-No, I trust you. I trust you guys. I trust you.



As the field whittled from thousands
to hundreds, things became trickier.



-Anybody Jewish around here?
-Why?



-Are you Jewish?
-Why?



I've got a name to read.
I don't know how to say it.



We start at 1 1 :00.
Last appointment, right now.



-Yokov? Yokov?
-Yeah.



Okay, great. Thanks.



Make your time for you to work with people
if you wanted to get up,



You to get up and play with people.



Rochmel Lev Ben Yokov...



Yokov Meyer Beckenstein.



Tomorrow we start at 10:00.
Cassies, Vals, Sheilas.



-And they're dancing at 10:00 first?
-They're dancing at 10:00.



-Okay. We should be able to go on this now.
-Yeah.



That's the story of my life
I remember when everybody was my size



Boy, was that great.
But then everybody started moving up,



And there I was, stuck at 4'10".



Do I get a chance to say
who I want to play my life? No.



-Yes, you do.
-No.



-So let's hit it.
-Okay. Tell me your name, stage name.



It has always been Baayork Lee.



Mother and father from two different
backgrounds and religions,



Buddhist and Muslim. Mucho conflict.



Born in New York City,
Lower East Side. Ghetto.



That night, that 24 hours, all the stories
came out of that first tape session.



The man upstairs was a dancing teacher,
and he saw something.



He said I was gonna be a ballerina.



So I was going to the School of
American Ballet to become a prima ballerina.



I just wanted to dance. But I never grew.
That was my problem. I never got any taller.



I used to hang from the parallel bars
by the hour,



Hoping I'd stretch just an inch more,



'Cause I was into dancing then,
and I was good.



And I wanted so much
to grow up to be a prima ballerina.



It's always hard for the girls,
'cause I'm sitting there



And I'm demanding so much from them.



-Ls she American born?
-Hey, Yuka?



-Yes?
-Where were you born?



-I'm from Okinawa, Japan.
-How long have you been here?



-Since '98.
-'98. Yeah, okay.



I'm going to work on Yuka's
American accent, which I know she can get.



There's something about
being born in America



-And fighting, at five years old, for a seat.
-Fighting for a...



-A seat on the F train.
-A seat on the...



-Okay.
-You know what I'm saying?



I was really nervous at the audition
because she was right there at the table,



And it was just nerve-Wracking, you know,
'cause she is Connie.



-Hey, you? Ten.
-Ten!



-Ten.
-Ten.



-Good. Dancing.
-Dancing!



There you go. Get out of here. Yeah.



I went to an agency



And they keep typecasting me



Yes, I'm Asian. I came from Saigon



But on Broadway I even played a blonde



I got more in me



And you can set it free



I can play any role that I can



Even Afro-American
Remember my name, Elaine



-Did you like her as Connie?
-I want her as Connie.



You want her as Connie.
She gets your vote, huh?



She gets my vote.



We started to bond,
and a lot of things started to come out.



Michael was very clever.



He would reveal something about himself
that nobody had ever heard or knew,



Myself included,
and it was kind of provocative



And touching and shocking.



We are in Israel rehearsing West Side Story.



For some reason, I ended up
on the roof of this hotel with Grover alone.



And the last thing I wanted to happen
was to get involved with Grover.



He opened certain doors
about his own privacy



And his own sexuality
and his own teenage angst.



Grover says, "Would you like a cigarette?"



Tries to light it and it keeps going out.



And he said,
"Would you like some brandy?"



And it's about 5:00 in the afternoon.



For me, I'm thinking
that's very early for brandy.



I remember saying, "I'm very sorry, but... "
and running.



Running and running down 13 floors
of this hotel's stairway



'Cause I'm gonna be straight!



And it was like he was saying,



"Okay, I give you permission now
to speak from your heart."



I was very effeminate as a child and I had...



I kept feeling her boobs.



She said,
"Don't you want to touch anything else?"



And I said, "No, I really don't. "



I really spray-Painted one boy silver.



As far as my tits are concerned,
that's the best thing I've ever done.



Good God!



As I was watching



Dancers just talk about Broadway
and their lives,



I began to hear musical numbers.
So Marvin, being a dance arranger,



For me, was the ideal person
to write this musical about dancers.



I had worked with Michael Bennett prior,
just as a dance music arranger,



And I thought this guy was a genius.



Now, I had gotten myself out to Hollywood
basically because that's where the work was.



And here I was receiving three
Academy Awards, couldn't believe it.



And about four or five weeks later
I get a phone call from this genius.



And the genius says that he wants me
to come back to New York now,



'Cause he has an idea for a show,
and he wants me to just drop everything.



Now, you can imagine.



I go to my agent and say,
"You know, now that we're at the top,



"And we can really field all the great offers,
I'm leaving," you know,



And then we'd have to revive him for a while.



So he tells me the following.



"I've been talking to a lot of chorus kids,
and I have these tapes.



"And these tapes are just them talking,



"And I have slowly but surely
had them typed out,



"And I want you to read these tapes because
I think that there's something in this. "



I come from a school of beginning,
middle and ends, right,



So I'm going, "Yes, and?"
"No, that's it. That is it."



So he has all these tapes, and he sat there
and said, "What is this thing?"



But he knew, the most important thing,
he knew it was going to take a long time.



And there came the great man, Joe Papp.



I mean, that was where
Michael found his genius producer.



And Joe said, "Okay, you've got the space.
Everybody makes $100 a week.



"That's the cast, you guys, the writers,
you name it."



And I said, "Michael, $100 a week,
how can we do this?"



And he said, "It's worth it.



"We're just going to gamble.
We're going to do it."



And I went, "Okay," as I've always done.



And we spent the summer in my apartment



Writing what amounted
to something like that.



This was the period in which people
wrote a show, went out of town,



Either had a hit, had a miss,
whatever, that was it.



There was no such thing as a workshop.



This was the first time
the workshop device had been used.



Michael, in a sense, created it with Joe Papp.



We did a first run-Through
in our first workshop



Where we had, like, one song at that point.



We refer to that day
as the Day of the Towering lnferno.



I mean, it was the most overdramatic,



-Melodramatic, indulgent...
-Lndulgent.



It was quite awful and really boring,
after all, because you could see,



Okay, we're only on four now,
and we've got how many?



One person steps out of the line
and tells you the story of his life,



And you look down the line and you go,
"Oh, my God, 16 more to go."



We were going to be in trouble.



So we decided on this kind of montage,
framed by Hello 13, Hello 14, Hello Love.



So when it's over, you'll have gotten,
in 15 minutes, what would have taken hours.



Hello twelve



Hello thirteen



Hello love



Changes, oh!



Down below



Up above



Then we took a break and edited it down
and added a few more songs.



So now comes the second workshop,



And in the second workshop,
things really start to come together.



We were doing something downtown.



Don't tell anybody
what we're doing downtown.



We were not supposed to tell, you know,
our boyfriends or spouses or anything.



But there was such a buzz around New York
that things were going on downtown.



The first song they wrote
on our second workshop was At The Ballet.



And we were all sitting there,
and it was like,



I knew that this was going to be
a great thing to be in, a great show.



We always talk about
where the heart and soul of the show is.



The heart and soul is in At The Ballet.



That lyric, that continuum
of three people telling you



About their lives, that's where the show
grabs the audience and says,



"Hey, this is important. "



I used to dance around the living room
with my arms up like this.



With my arms up like this.
My fantasy was it was an lndian chief,



And he'd say,
"Maggie, do you want to dance?"



And I'd say, "Daddy, I would love to dance."



She said, "You'll be very attractive,



"And you'll be different,
but you are not pretty. "



Different, she said
With a special something



And a very, very personal flair



...my mother, and when I was, like, five,



I remember helping her
dig earrings out of the car.



That I knew, at five...



When I was five, I remember my mother
Dug earrings out of the car



I knew that they weren't hers
but it wasn't something you want to discuss



Every time you have to go in
and start all over.



You have to sing again,
you have to dance again.



Everyone on that panel has to agree.



To me, Rachelle Rak is like...



If it were the '50s,
she is the classic sort of gypsy.



She fell 16 feet into the trap
in The Look of Love, right?



And she got up, she finished the show.



And then she said,
"And now I'm going to the hospital.



"And I'll see you in about two weeks,
and I'll be back."



The odds of everyone agreeing,
they are just slim to none.



She wanted to be a dancer.
She had all these scholarships and all that.



And when she got married, my father
made her give it up. Isn't this exciting?



And then she had this daughter, me,



And she made her
exactly what she wanted to be,



And it was fabulous the way she did it.



Am I tall enough? Am I pretty enough?
Am I good enough?



If you went into work every day saying,
"Do you like me?



"Can I do it? Can l...
Am I what you're looking for?"



My mother was raised like a little nun.



She couldn't even go out.
She couldn't even babysit.



Sheila, don't perform. Just talk.



And she made her what she wanted to be.



Well, first, she took me to see all the ballets,
and then she gave me her old toe shoes.



And I used to run down the sidewalk
on my toes at five.



And when she saw I really had to dance,
she said...



"You can't do it until you're eight,"



And by then I was only six,
and I just had to scream,



"But I've got to dance."
I mean, anything to get out of that house.



But everything was beautiful at the ballet



Graceful men lift lovely girls in white



Yes, everything was beautiful at the ballet



I was happy at the ballet



-You did great. You did great.
-Thanks.



-Lt was very interesting, your choices.
-Thank you.



-I really had a great time. Thank you.
-I really enjoyed it.



-Well, we're glad you came in.
-Okay. Bye. Thanks.



She is one of the few people
that understands Sheila. She is Sheila.



-Now, what's your mom's name?
-My mom's name is Laura Klein.



-Laura's your mother?
-She loves you, and she loves you, so much.



It's ridiculous.



-I'm speechless.
-And she was a Bebe?



Yeah.



Mother always said I'd be very attractive
when I grew up



When I grew up



Different, she said
With that special something



And a very, very personal flair



Though I was eight or nine



Though I was eight or nine



Though I was eight or nine



I hated her



And everyone was beautiful at the ballet



Every prince has got to have his swan



Yes, everything



Was beautiful



At the ballet, hey



I was pretty at the ballet



Just like her mother.



I can see her doing all the Bebe lines
and being that girl.



"Please, give me a break, you know.



"They told me Broadway was dead
when I got here."



-I can hear her do that.
-Yeah.



Everything, everything was...



Everything was, everything was



Raise your arms
And someone's always there



What makes At The Ballet so moving,
of course, is Maggie's crescendo.



At the ballet
At the ballet



At the ballet



You don't have to scream it, you know.



At the ballet
At the ballet



That's not easy.



Everything was beautiful at the ballet



Raise your arms
And someone's always there



Yes, everything was beautiful



At the ballet



At the ballet



At the ballet



-Good girl, Mara. Very nice job.
-Thank you.



Michael said, "That's the score.
That's where I want the score to be.



"I want that kind of originality for the show. "



I want to be Val. I've got the boobs up.



Mom in Missouri is going to be so proud
that I just said that.



I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm not trained for this.



You know, just do it by ear and have fun.



By the time the character of Val
steps forward and says,



"Well, the day I turned 18,



"L got on a Trailways bus
and headed for the Big, Bad Apple,"



You have heard about someone
at four, five, six, seven, eight.



You've heard all the dancers
take you, collectively,



Through childhood, adolescence,
and up to 18.



So the day after I turned 18,
I kissed the folks goodbye,



Got on a Trailways bus
and headed for the Big, Bad Apple.



That was my plan.
New York, New York, here I come.



Val is very difficult.



A lot of people get confused about that role
and they think she's a tough girl.



Let's get one thing straight.
I never heard of The Red Shoes.



I never saw The Red Shoes.
I don't give a fuck about The Red Shoes.



She's got a truck-Driver's mouth,



But she's really a sweetheart
and a very likable girl.



Except I have one minor problem.



-See, I was ugly as sin. I was ugly.
-Skinny.



-Homely.
-Unattractive and...



Flat as a pancake. Get the picture?



Tits and Ass wasn't getting any laughs.
Zero, zero, laughs.



I thought that was one of the funniest songs
I'd ever written,



And the girl was doing it great.



On the third preview, Michael said,



"Guys, if we don't fix this pretty soon,
you're gonna have to write another number."



I said, "Michael, you've got to be kidding."



Fixed the chassis



How do you do



Life turned into



An endless medley of, "Gee



"It had to be you. " Why?



-Tits
-And ass



Ed and I decided to look at the show
the way the audience did.



It was the first time
that we were handed a program.



We opened the program
and we immediately went, "Whoops!



"Oh, my God!
We're giving away the punch line. "



Have it all done
Honey, take my word



Grab a cab
Come on, see the wizard



On Park and 73rd



For tits and ass



Changed the title the next day
to Dance, Ten. Looks, Three.



They came to the lyric, "tits and ass,"
it got a laugh.



Tits and ass
Yes, tits and ass



Have changed my life



That was horrible. It was horrible.



-Nikki, have you ever played the part?
-No, I never have.



-It's really good.
-Thank you.



-You're really good.
-Thanks a lot.



They're talking about me. I hate that.



This girl's got it.



-She just needs to be, like, guided into it.
-That's all. It's all about pacing and timing.



-Hey, Amanda?
-Yeah?



So, they want you to come back on the 23rd.



-Okay, great, okay.
-Okay.



I got a callback!



Oh, my God, I just yelled that really loud,



And there's somebody else auditioning
for Val. I feel bad. But I got a callback.



We're considering you for cover, okay?



-For cover for...
-For cover, right now, for Val,



-And maybe like a second casting cover.
-Okay.



If a dancer walks in, and they've got
that special little bit of magic,



You go that way. And if they can bring
something fresh to the role,



It's what you're attracted to. I mean,
the likeability factor is very important.



They're, like, "Chryssie,
we're totally in town for A Chorus Line.



"We want to see you for it."
And I was, "Yeah, that's right."



I mean, I totally had forgotten
that they were casting it.



And I was, like, "That's right."



I was, like, "What do you see me as?"
And I usually get... Sorry.



I thought,
"What are you thinking me of, as Judy?"



And she was, "No, actually,
we're thinking of you as Kristine."



And my first reaction was,
"Well, that's the girl that can't sing."



In my own little corner
In my own little chair



I can be whatever I want to be



I'm a slave from Calcutta
I'm a queen in Peru



I'm a mermaid dancing upon the sea



That's the most important thing.
You instantly liked her.



-You like her.
-And she's perfect with Tony Yazbeck.



That's always the bottom line thing,
like you said.



It's, you gotta like them right away.



It's funny, you know, when you audition,
you play it out in your head 100 times



Of how it could go,
and it never goes that way.



I picked up my foot, touched it
to the back of my head and said,



"This little girl could be a star."



When you're finally out there,
it's like this surreal feeling of,



"I'm auditioning right now. It's happening
right now. I'm thinking about my cat.



"I'm not thinking about the audition. I have
to focus. Oh, my gosh, what if I get this?



"What if I don't get this?"



There's, like, a million thoughts
going through your head.



Except I had this little...



Problem.



Interesting take, Jennifer. It's wonderful.



My sister would go home
and she would practice her routines



Downstairs in the basement,
and I would go down and I'd say,



"I can do that. " She would be working
real hard and I'd say, "I can do that. "



The people who are more used to shows
constructed like My Fair Lady,



I Can Do That is a lovely way
to put them at ease and say,



"That's all right.
You're going to see singing and dancing,



"And it's not going to be
a threatening experience."



I can do that



I can do that



Knew every step
Right off the bat



I said, I can do that



I can do that



One morning Sis won't go to dance class



I grabbed her shoes and tights and all



But my foot's too small, so



I stuff her shoes with extra socks



Run seven blocks in nothing flat



Hell, I can do that



I can do that



I got to class and had it made



And so I stayed the rest of my life



All thanks to Sis



Now married and fat



I can do this



That I can do
I can do that



That was fun. I did what I wanted to do,
and that's all that matters.



Sometimes nerves take over,
and you don't show them who you are.



But that's not what's going on.
That's my party in there, not theirs.



They're invited to my party.
For me, it's just, I'm not desperate.



My life goes on with or without it.
What's important is the work.



I go in that room for those 10 minutes,
I do what I want to do,



And the rest is whatever.



-Hey, Tyce?
-Yes?



They want you to come to callbacks.



I made it to the final callbacks.
Yes, for Kristine!



It went so amazing. Sorry!



Nicholas Dante's speech,
the speech that Paul makes



About his parents coming
and seeing him in drag,



Was heart-Stopping that night.



I knew I was gay, and that didn't bother me.



What really bothered me
was I didn't know how to be a boy,



And I used to wish I was a girl.



I started hanging around 42nd Street,
trying to meet friends that were gay,



That I could understand what it was I was.



And somebody told me that
they were looking for male dancers



For the Jewel Box Revue.



When Michael heard that, he said,
"I have to use that. "



This was so personal to him, because...



He felt all of that shame
of not being able to be honest,



Of being judged, self-Critical,
not his own best friend.



And he was tired of apologizing for living.



When Nicholas Dante,
the evening of the taped sessions,



Told me about his life, which was basically
what is the Paul monologue in the show,



What we call the Paul monologue,
I was so moved.



And not only moved by the story,
but moved by the way he expressed himself.



And I went down to audition. And they said,



"Well, you're too short to be a boy,
but would you like to be a pony?"



And I said, "What is a pony?"
And they said, "A girl. "



"You're too short to be a boy.
Would you like to be a pony?"



And I said, "What's that?"
And he said, "A girl."



And I said, "Well, what do I have to do?"
And they said, "Show us your legs."



"But I have hair on my legs."
"It's okay. Just come on upstairs."



So I went.



Well, they hiked up my dungarees



And they put on a pair of nylon stockings
and high heels.



And it was so pretty, so incredible.



Next to Cassie, probably Paul
is the biggest challenge of casting.



Next to Cassie, probably Paul
is the biggest challenge of casting.



I mean, I really wanted to perform.



One day my cousin told me,
"You'll never be an actor."



And I knew she was saying this
because I was such a sissy.



I don't know. No, he's not for us.



And I knew she was saying this
because I was such a sissy. I mean,



I was terribly effeminate.



Not bad.



I always knew I was gay,
but it didn't bother me.



What bothered me was that
I didn't know how to be a boy.



-Should this be a DTL?
-What is DTL?



-Down the line.
-Down the line.



-Did you make that up?
-It's a biz term.



-That's what we call it. That's what we do.
-That's casting.



What bothered me was that
I didn't know how to be a boy.



-This we know is no.
-No.



This we know is no. This we know is no.
This we know is no.



We saw so, so many Pauls.



And we searched and searched,
and Jason Tam came into the room.



We were doing this oriental number,



And I looked like Cyd Charisse.



I mean... No, Anna May Wong.
Anna May Wong.



I mean, I had these great big
chrysanthemums on either side of my head,



This huge headdress
with gold balls hanging all over it.



I was going on for the finale.



I was going down the stairs, and who should
I see standing next to the stage door?



My parents.
You know, they got there too early.



I freaked. I didn't know what to do,
you know, so I thought to myself,



"L know. I'll just keep walking past them
like all the others



"And they'll never recognize me."



And so I take a deep breath
and I walk down the stairs,



And just as I pass my mother, I hear her say,



"Oh, my God.



"Paul."



I died, you know, but what could I do?



You know, I had to go on for the finale,
so I just kept going.



After the show, I went to my dressing room,



And after I was done dressing
and taking off my makeup,



I went back downstairs.



And there they were,
standing in the middle of all of these...



All they said to me was,



"Please write.



"Make sure you eat,
and take care of yourself."



And just before my parents left,



My father turned to the producer
and he said,



"Take care of my son."



That's the first time he ever called me that.



So that was... That was it.



So I looked at the producer,
and he said, "Take care of my son."



That was the first time
he ever called me that.



Boy, you got me.



For an audition, Jesus, that's excellent.



-Okay. Wait outside.
-Thank you.



Thank you.



Oh, my God.



I'm crying.



I haven't cried in, what, 30 years.



Sign him up.



Cassie, stay on stage, please.



Wow!



-This audition is really interesting, isn't it?
-Yeah. What are you doing here?



-What do you think? I need a job.
-Ln the chorus?



Look, Zach, I'd love a part in the chorus,
but I'll take what I can get.



You're too good for the chorus, Cassie.



Too good? Wow.



I did a couple of dance spots, so...



You were featured.
You stopped two shows cold.



Your career was going fine
here in New York.



I can't get a job, Zach.



I definitely feel I've been around enough
to say those lines that Cassie says.



I understand being successful
and then not being able to get a job.



It's a role that I've always wanted to play.



It's one of the first Broadway shows
that I saw, when I was 1 1 years old.



I ran around as a kid singing
Music and the Mirror.



My whole thing is I haven't had my break yet.



I want to spend my time
on this Earth dancing.



This is the best part of me,



And that's what's resonant
about what Cassie talks about,



Because this is me.
When I can do this, I'm me.



The selection of the Cassie
is the most difficult role to cast.



I mean, it was built originally
for Donna McKechnie,



And it was based on her gifts.



Donna McKechnie was such an organic
dancer when it came to the music.



She just could hear it all
and physicalize it all.



To find that special gal who could sing
the role and dance the role and act the role,



It's a lot of subtle qualities
that you've got to find in one performer.



You just continue gossiping
and schmoozing with each other,



And I'm just gonna come around you
one at a time and get to know you



And get to meet you a little bit, okay?
And then Baayork's gonna teach you.



But I want to know who you are first,
before we start.



So I'll start with Colleen
'cause we know each other.



-Hi.
-Hi, sweetie. How are you?



-I'm good.
-Come say hello.



-Okay.
-How are you doing?



I'm such a fan. Your work is so amazing.



I saw you in Movin' Out
and, of course, in Fosse.



Nadine, right! I saw you in Paper Mill, right?



-Yes, yes, yes.
-Yeah, you were the Val, right?



Yes, I was.



-You replaced Lauren Kennedy...
-I did, yes. Yes.



...in Sunset Boulevard.



Reading this scene,
the scene we have for the sides today,



Was a little too close to home.
Do you know what I mean?



You go out to LA and you keep trying
and you keep trying and you keep trying,



And it just kind of eats at your soul.



So you're going through a slow period.
Happens to everyone.



Something will happen.



That's what I kept telling myself
in California.



You didn't work out there?



Well, sure. I was a go-Go dancer
in a TV movie of the week.



Let's see, commercials.



I almost got to squeeze a roll of toilet paper,
but I lost out in the finals.



And I was in California going,
"God, get me out of here."



I needed a real job. "I'm not happy.



"L want to work. I want to dance.
I want to sing. I want to act."



I need a job.



To have something that I can believe in



To have someone to be



Use me, choose me



I just can't see you
dancing in the chorus, Cassie.



-Why not?
-Listen, if you need some money,



-Call my business manager.
-Sure, I need money, who doesn't?



But I don't need a handout. I need a job.



I need a job, I don't know how else to say it.
I mean, do you want me to say it again?



-No.
-Okay. Fine. I got that far.



Look,



I haven't worked in two years.



Not really.



There's nothing left for me to do,
so I am putting myself on the line.



Yes, I am putting myself on your line.



I don't want to wait on tables.



What I really don't want to do
is teach other people how to be doing



What I should be doing myself.



God, I'm a dancer



A dancer dances



-Bravo.
-Very nice, very nice.



Natascia, we need to...
Baayork to work with you,



So I understand you want to stay today
and work some more later.



One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.



That dance was very, very difficult to get,
so we just started with being.



And I didn't come up with the...
The first step he came up with was,



You know, "Do this.
I want this to be very stark and angular."



It's like... He said, "You know,
when someone used to do something,



"And they're not sure if they can do it?
It's like, I'll just try this."



When you turn around, you're there.



Look.



What happens for a dancer
in front of a mirror



And the sense of identity one gets



When one has grown up
in front of the mirror,



To see yourself in the mirror,
that you take that mirror away



And you don't replace it
with eyeballs or applause



Or something else to give you
that sense of who you are.



If she doesn't see herself, she feels invisible.



She feels so low
that she has to see herself in the reflection.



And bend, bend, bend.



Okay.



And then you just fall back
as far as you can.



-I'm sure it is.
-Okay.



Up, up and then...



And then you can plie, plie,
plie, plie and drop.



There you go.



Do me a favor, when you're down there,
can you switch it to that side?



Yeah.



-All right. Great, Charlotte.
-Was she the last?



The solo dance number
is tremendously taxing.



And it goes on for a long time,
and it's also running the four-Minute mile.



Turn, lunge, roll, step, pas de bourree,
one, two, three.



-One, two, three. But this is three?
-Yeah.



And one.



That's it, girlfriend.



-That's it.
-That's it.



-And you hear it in the accents.
-All right.



Okay. Here we go. That is it.
A five, six, seven and...



Turn, lunge, roll.



Anybody who says, "l have a right to live
and do what I want to do



"And do what I love,
even if you don't like it,"



Deserves a second chance.



When Cassie didn't get a job,



People walked out that night so depressed.
It was horrible.



We found out that there was something off
at the end.



We didn't know what it was,
but it wasn't right.



And it was just always, like, close,



But it wasn't that thing
where you went, "Wow!"



But one day,
Marsha Mason came to the show.



She said to Michael
that she thought it was wrong



That Donna McKechnie, in that role,
did not get the job.



Marsha Mason said,



"The audience goes against you, Michael,
because the girl has done everything right.



"She's given up everything for this job,
and she may be overqualified,



"But she needs the job.



"You're alienating the audience
because you're getting rid of her



"Only because
you have got a problem with her."



So Michael, that night, changed the ending
and let Cassie get the job.



Standing ovation from that night on.



I would like to not care.
I would like to not care if I am a success.



I mean, I would like to know that,
for instance,



If my career should fall apart,
it's gonna be just fine.



Now, I probably can never do that.



No. This is a no. This is a no.



It's just about getting her motor going,
but she can act.



-I think he comes off a little young.
-I agree.



And as a Mike, he's the right age,
but he doesn't have the top notes.



I don't remember her.



I don't think she sings well enough.



-Judy or Kristine.
-Right.



Yeah, but you know what?
She doesn't have the voice.



-Yes. Don't you think?
-She'd be fine as a Sheila.



-Well, that's pretty good.
-Yeah.



-Okay.
-Great.



We could do a lot worse.



Nice job.



-You're gonna be onstage.
-For the final callout?



They're going to put you up on a line.



-It's hot.
-It's gonna be the, like...



-It's gonna be fun.
-It's gonna be the real deal for a minute.



-They're gonna put you on the line.
-I'm gonna start to cry.



-No, no. It's gonna be great.
-I have, like, all day long.



If I was going to be on that stage,
I was going to look like I belonged.



-It's the final, final callback.
-Final, final, so I need good shoes.



You've been doing this
for about eight months now?



-Yeah.
-Well, you know,



-The likes of Charlotte d'Amboise.
-She'll be there on Monday?



-That's great.
-Yeah, you're up with the big guys now.



I know, it's a little... Surreal.



-Well, it had to happen sometime.
-It's the way it should be, honey.



Broadway!



Of course, you see who's up here, honey.
Donna McKechnie.



I know!
She saw a video of me doing the dance.



She wrote me a letter
and gave me, like, words of advice.



She was like, "You're a beautiful dancer."



She's like, "Just always remember
that it's not... Don't work.



"Don't show the work, and just enjoy it."



Well, dance, ten
Looks, three



And I'm still on the unemployment
Dancing for my own enjoyment



That ain't it, kid
That ain't it, kid



What do I do to prepare for a final callback?



I'm probably gonna chant a little
and dance around my living room.



Good. It looks great.



You have to keep shaking your hair out,
though, because it gets wiggy.



To have something that I can believe in



To have someone to be



Beautiful.



Use me, choose me



Even my acting coach, he said,
"You are so right for this. "



I said, "l can't even hear it from anyone,"
because it's so deep



That I don't want it to hurt that bad.
Do you know what I mean?



You know how you just don't?
It's like love, it's like being in love.



You don't want to love someone so much



Because you know
it's going to hurt so much.



Okay. So tomorrow, you're coming back
at 10:00 at the Broadhurst.



Okay?



I'm nothing like Sheila,
but I think that's the fun part



Of being an actress is to find parts of you
that can connect to it



And other parts... Just go and have fun.



I need this job
because I'm out of unemployment.



You're out of unemployment?



So I really need this job!



It's not for the weak of heart,
I'll tell you that right now.



You have to... It teaches you to take things
and it teaches you how to live,



Actually, funnily enough,
if you have the stomach for it,



Because you have to go in and commit 100%
and be totally passionate about it.



Give your everything and risk it not working.



Right now, all of the sudden,
my heart's starting to race again,



-Thinking I'm going to be on the...
-Yeah.



Okay. So I'm at the theater.



This is too flimsy.



I called my father and...



Oh, my God,
and I had him say a prayer for me.



And he never... God, this is so stupid.



I've never had my father say a prayer for me.



Usually, I say the prayer,
and I had my dad say it.



So I just said, "Dad, I just need you
to say a prayer for me for tomorrow."



Like, "Whatever is supposed to be will be."
Because it's all good.



I don't even know why I'm crying.



I hate that, that I'm doing that
on the camera right now.



I remember my dad,
he just had both knees replaced.



He's a ballet dancer.



And I remember him literally, like,
weeping and just saying,



"Oh, my God, you know. I get it.



"L get what it is not to dance anymore."



Ask the gymnast, "Is it worth it?", that tore
her shoulder but was in the Olympics.



Ask the farmer, who have thick calluses
on their hands, the working-Man hand,



"Ls it worth it?" It's a price you pay.



You never know what's the next day.



So each night that you go on that stage
is opening night, but it's also closing night.



You don't know for sure.



It becomes everything there is, the cosmos.



The hardest thing is when you can't dance.



I think I was 40-Something
when that knee went out.



It really went out,
and I ended up in the hospital.



And you know,
"You're not gonna dance again."



That was hard,
because you begin to form who you are.



"L am a dancer. I am a dancer."
"Now you can't dance." "Who am l?"



But then I got a phone call
from Balanchine saying,



"When can you get back?"



So I was back onstage six weeks later.



And at the end of dancing,
my dance boot was full of blood.



-Bye, Daddy.
-All right. You take care.



I'll take care. Yes, I know.



-All right.
-All right.



You're going to take Shelby
and show it to her.



That's another reason why I like
A Chorus Line.



What we did for love.



Hi.



I just want to say,
you've just done so well to get here,



Because the competition was fierce.



Am I the first one here?



Now, today you're going to be nervous.
All I can say is use that.



That's what the play is about.



So when you're standing on the stage
and you're dancing



And we're checking you out,
take that nervousness onboard.



Use it.
Use it as actors, and don't be afraid of it.



Let it put you in the right place,
because that's what's going on today.



Okay?



And I thank you all for being here.
You did great.



I've got my fingers crossed for all of you.



All right. Thanks, everybody,
and good luck, okay?



Thank you.



A one and two, three, four.
Five and six, seven.



Accelerating, one, two...



Meredith! Oh, my God. Hello, honey!



We did also grow up together.



Okay, Baayork,
I'm going to count you off, okay?



One, a two, a one, two, three, four.



The way you get a job on Broadway
is you walk in



And at that particular moment,



You are giving an opening night,
finished performance.



I was up against my closest friend, Elaine.



I was happy that she was there,
but at the same time, it was a battle.



4'10".



4'10". That is the story of my life.



-I'm sorry. I need to take that one more time.
-Sure.



4'10". 4'10". That is the story of my life.



I remember when everyone was my size.



But then everyone started moving up.



4'10". 4'10". That's the story of my life.



I remember when everybody was my size.
Boy, was that great.



But then everybody started moving up,
and there I was, stuck at 4'10".



Her enthusiasm and her animation.
She's the most like what the...



The physical-Ness
that you used to bring to it.



I'm glad you think I'm cute because I don't.



-Of course, I don't see myself that way.
-Right. Right.



-I'm a survivor, you know?
-Right.



It's hard, but...



-But I'll be happy either way. Yeah.
-Yeah, either way.



-I'll be... Yeah.
-Yeah.



Now we're really, like, fighting for it now.



I think it feels more like, okay,
down to the wire kind of thing.



Watch this!



He's serious. He's heavy, but very talented.



I got to class and had it made



And so I stayed the rest of my life



All thanks to Sis



Now married and fat



I said, I can do this



The beginning is wonderful.



I can do this



That I can do



I can do that



Beautiful.



They said I did a beautiful job.



I think it was Bob Avian who said,
"Beautiful job, Tyce. "



I watched everything
that had dancing on it on television.



Especially... Oh, God, every Sunday it was...



-Ed Sullivan.
-Right. Ed Sullivan,



Every Sunday. Like church.



-Every Sunday it was...
-Ed Sullivan



Ed Sullivan, every Sunday. Like church.



This man, he came around
to my house selling...



Lessons.



And he was a terrific salesman.



He put me up against the television set.



-He turned me around...
-Picked up my foot and...



-Touched it to the back of my...and said
-Head...



-"This little girl could be a star."
-"This little girl could be a star."



I did Fosse here for two and a half years.



So I went up to the top floor.
I went to the old dressing room,



And all of a sudden I just started...
My tears started coming.



Like just total...
Completely crying, like, thank you, God,



Iike, for... I'm so glad I'm here.



But everything was beautiful at the ballet



Graceful men lift lovely girls in white



Yes, everything was beautiful at the ballet



I was happy at the ballet



Good, Rachelle, great.
Just wait in the wings for a second.



Okay.



-Lt wasn't here today.
-Lt wasn't there at all.



I would give her an adjustment
and see what she does.



Okay.



-I want you to try it again.
-Okay.



You made some very different choices today
than you did the last time you read it.



You went to a very vulnerable place today
that you shouldn't have.



And when you came in last time,
you threw it all away. You were funnier...



-That's fine. Yeah.
-That's the girl I want.



Yeah. Yeah.



And he said, "I want you to do
what you did last summer. "



I didn't know what I did last summer.
I had broken up with my boyfriend.



I had all of this stuff last summer.
It was eight months ago.



And I don't know what I did last summer.



-All right. Can we do it again?
-Yeah. Absolutely.



-Okay. Do you need a couple of minutes?
-Yeah, let me take a second.



-Let me just...
-I'll see someone else and call you back.



-Yeah, why don't you do that?
-Okay, okay.



All right, Cyrus. I'll be back.



Sheila, come downstage.



Closer.



Can I sit in your lap?



Do you always come on like this?



No, sometimes I'm aggressive.
Actually, I'm a Leo.



What's that supposed to mean?



It means the other 11 months of the year
need to watch out.



-I'm very strong.
-Maybe too strong.



Am I doing something you don't like?
You told me to be myself!



-Bring it down.
-Bring what down?



Your attitude.



But everything was beautiful at the ballet



Graceful men lift lovely girls in white



Yes, everything was beautiful at the ballet



Hey, I was happy at the ballet



-Good, Deidre.
-Bravo.



-Thank you.
-You did really good.



-Thanks so much, you guys.
-All right. Take care.



Bye.



Your mind can be really mean to you
about things like this.



Your mind can be really mean to you
about things like this.



Like maybe you're going to be too this
or too that or whatever.



So it's just a matter of trying to zone out
about today.



Let's get one thing straight.
I never heard about The Red Shoes.



I never saw The Red Shoes.
I didn't give a...about The Red Shoes.



Tits and ass
Bought myself a fancy pair



Tightened up my derriere
Did the nose with it



All that goes with it
Tits and ass



Had the bingo-Bongos done
Suddenly I'm getting national tours



Fixed the chassis
How do you do?



Life turned into an endless medley
Of "Gee, it had to be you"



Why? Tits and ass



-Am I done?
-I think you are.



-Okay.
-You've done great.



That's great.



Flat and sassy
I would get the strays and losers



Beggars really can't be choosers



That ain't it, kid
That ain't it, kid



Fixed the chassis
How do you do?



Life turned into an endless medley
Of "Gee, it had to be you"



Why?
Tits and ass



-That's all we need.
-Okay.



-Thanks very much.
-Thank you.



She's like the Hollywood starlet
version of her.



You know what's funny,
is when we were dancing that day,



This blonde girl that I had never seen before
was killing it, just dancing circles.



And I thought, "Who's that girl?
I really hope she's not up for Val. "



And I went up to her and I said,
"What part are you up for?"



And she's like,
"I'm up for understudying Cassie and Val. "



So the day after I turned 1 8
I kissed the folks goodbye,



Got on a Trailways bus
and headed for the Big, Bad Apple.



Because I wanted to be a Rockette.



Yeah, let's get one thing straight.
See, I never heard about The Red Shoes.



I never saw The Red Shoes.
I didn't give a frig about The Red Shoes.



That was my plan.
New York, New York, here I come.



Life turned into an endless medley
Of "Gee, it had to be you"



Why? Tits and ass



Where the cupboard once was bare
Now you look and someone's there



You have got them, hey
Top to bottom, hey



It's a gas
Just a dash of silicone



Shake your new maracas and you'll find



Tits and ass can change your life



They sure changed mine



-Do you have a cold today?
-Yeah. Yeah, I do.



-All right.
-It's kind of hard to hear myself today.



-All right, but you did really well, darling.
-Thank you.



It's a cold.



So I'm a little freaked out 'cause I got called
back onstage to do the scene again.



So, I don't know.
Hopefully that's a good sign.



-Today, you were working it a little hard.
-Okay.



-Go at it a little easier.
-Okay.



And think of her being a little...
What's the word? Less of a showgirl.



-A little more innocent.
-Okay.



-I don't know if that confuses you.
-No, that's good. I'm from St. Louis.



-Okay. You knew what I meant.
-Yeah.



Oh, yeah, let's get one thing straight.
I never heard about The Red Shoes.



I never saw The Red Shoes.
I didn't give a frig about The Red Shoes.



...you, Radio City and the Rockettes.
I'm going to dance on Broadway.



Well, dance, ten
Looks, three...



Good. Nicole. Nicole, much better, darling.



-Yeah, is that more what you're going for?
-Yeah.



-Okay.
-It's more honest, you know. It's...



I was a little schmaltzy and nervesy
this morning, huh?



-But this was good.
-Good.



-Very good.
-Excellent.



-I'm glad we had this moment again.
-I'm glad I came back.



-Yeah.
-Excellent.



What did I do last summer?



Rack them.



How am I going to repeat what I did,
I can't remember what I did?



What does he remember that was so great?



How do I get that back?



That's when you start getting vulnerable.



But she wanted to be a dancer. And she had
all these scholarships and all that.



And when she got married,
my father made her give it up.



Isn't this exciting?



If you start to doubt or question,
you know, you're done.



I couldn't get it back.
I couldn't get back that one day.



You can't do it until you're eight.



Well, by then, I was only six,
and I said, "But I've got to dance."



Good, Rachelle. Good girl.
You did really good.



Thank you. Did I get it?



Jay, before you're done, I want to see you.



When you have tried to have ideas,



And for whatever reason it's not working,
that's when it becomes very frustrating.



-Yes, Jay?
-I've been castrated, so...



-I was going to say, what did she do?
-She said, "Listen, it's been eight months.



"Tell me now. Did I get it or didn't l?"



And she said, "I'm a big girl. I can take it.
Tell me right now. Did I get it or didn't l?"



-What'd you say?
-I said,



"It's between you and someone else,"



And she said, "Go find out
who is going to play the part."



She's not bitchy.
She said, "l just want to know."



-Just tell her that she didn't get it.
-She didn't get it.



-Yeah.
-Okay.



He's not going to come back alive.



He's going to come back
with an ax in his head.



It's not you. It's just my fate, I guess.



I'm on Broadway, just waiting and anxious.
If you only knew.



-But it's all good.
-All right, then.



Deidre walked onstage
and opened her mouth and there it was.



I got it. No, I got it! I got it!



That was one of the greatest joys
that we had.



I'm about to piss my pants.



I should do my laundry.
I should do my laundry,



But I don't want to do my laundry.
I'd rather have a cocktail.



I feel really good.
I woke up feeling good today.



Twenty-Three is a good number for me,
and that's today, January 23rd.



Cassie, stay onstage, please.



Whenever you audition for any show,
it's never easy.



Maybe... You know what it is?



It's having all those lights on you
on the stage there



'Cause you're not used to that.
You're used to black stage.



Do I see him?



I mean, am I talking to him or is it a voice?



You can't really see him.
He's in the back row of the theater.



So back there,
even though I see you, Michael.



-Okay. I... I'm fine.
-Do you want me to move?



No, no. The lights are in my face. It's fine.



-I mean, I can block you out.
-Yeah.



Okay.



This audition's really interesting, isn't it?



Yeah.



-What are you doing here?
-What do you think? I need a job.



-What do you think? I need a job.
-Ln the chorus?



Zach, I'd love a part, of course.



Look, Zach, I'd love a part, of course,
but I'll take what I can get.



-You're too good for the chorus, Cassie.
-Too good?



I did a couple of dance parts. So what?



You were featured.
You stopped two shows cold.



Your career's going fine around here.



God, you sound like all of my friends,
my fans!



Acting like I'm a star and don't know it,
when the truth is, I never even came close.



And no one has the guts to tell me.



Sure, it would be nice to be a star,
but I'm not. I'm a dancer.



Well, it would be nice to be a star,
but I'm not.



I'm a dancer.



The next section.



I know this choreography.
I've done it, you know? So I know it.



It's a question of just letting yourself fly.



Play me the music



Give me a chance to come through



All I ever needed



Was the music and the mirror



And the chance to dance for you



Give me a job
And you instantly get me involved



If you'll give me a job
Then the rest of the crap will get solved



Put me to work



You would think that by now
I'm allowed



I'll do you proud



I'll do you proud



Play me the music



Give me the chance to come through



All I ever needed



All I ever needed was music



And the mirror
And a chance



To dance



-You did great today.
-All right.



Thanks, darling. That was great.
Your day is done.



Thanks for working so hard.



Natascia, you did really well today, darling.
Thanks so much.



-You were beautiful.
-No, it was horrible.



-God, please. Please.
-You were so beautiful.



-Well, thanks. So were you.
-You were so beautiful.



-It's great to see you again.
-Good luck, honey.



We'll see what happens over the next phase.



Yeah. Good luck, Natascia.
I'll speak to you soon.



Do you want to tell her?
You want to go back and tell her?



-All right. You're okay?
-Go back.



-Take care.
-You, too.



All right.



It was the first time I didn't work,
and I was really sad,



And I thought maybe
I wasn't supposed to do this anymore.



And I even took
one of those aptitude tests, like,



"What should you do
when you grow up" tests.



And it said
you should use your intuition and perform.



And so I get to keep doing it
a little bit longer.



And I love it. It feels great. It just feels great.



Hello? Hello?



Yes.



Yes.



Hi, my darling.



Hi. I have good news for you.



Great. Let me sit down.



-Yuka's getting the offer for Connie.
-Shut up!



Yep!



I'm a yep.



I had a great audition for Chorus Line.



I did what I did. I grew this much.



Tyce isn't getting it.



Tyce kind of melted down a little bit, frankly.



His dancing yesterday was really wild.
His ego, it was out of control.



I want my own show. I want to be
on a soap opera. I want a record deal.



I want to do so many things.



I see myself walking up some stairs
receiving an award somewhere.



I try to just imagine
all these great things, you know?



Everyone's doing it. Everyone's doing it.



So many people are in show business.
How did they all get there?



There's room for more. Why not?



Mama?



So, they just took me, like out, out.
You know, outside, after, you know,



To tell me something.



And I got the job!



That's why I couldn't let you leave.



We really liked you. We were gonna call you,



But we figured we'd better let you know now.
Anyway, congratulations.



Thank you so much.



Thank you. Thank you.



She's playing the role.
She's playing the role!



Man, you know, I'm going to run
and kiss you right now.



-Well, you should 'cause I'm pretty fabulous.
-Are you kidding me?



-No, I'm telling you the truth.
-I think I'm gonna cry.



I know. You sound like you're gonna cry.



It's important
because it's a story about dancers



And what we go through every day.



And the stress
and what problems we have, you know.



And dealing with it and living with it.



And not regretting it
and just living our lives.



I think that's why this work is so important,
'cause it's the truth.



It's one of those things probably
for the rest of my life that I won't get over.



It's that one job that you've always wanted.



I'll see you in a minute.
I'm gonna get changed. All right. Bye.



You'd better look in the mirror,
and you'd better like yourself



Because they're not gonna like you
all the time.



There are going to be 100 nos to one yes.



-Where's your picture?
-My picture's right there.



See, right there?



I'm still waiting for my break.



I'm still... I'm still waiting to have my chance,



To come out and be the lead on Broadway.



And I know that's gonna happen.
I just... I know it's gonna happen.



Well, sure, I can do terrific fan kicks,
but they weren't good enough.



Of course, he was trying to tell me it was
the way I looked and not the fan kicks.



So I said, "Fuck you,
Radio City and the Rockettes.



"I'm gonna dance on Broadway."



Well, we finally made it to the big night,
opening night on Broadway.



God, I never thought it would happen.



It's about us. It's about what we do.
It's about the hard work it takes.



It takes your guts. It takes your soul.



But you're willing to give it.



One singular sensation
Every little step she takes



One thrilling combination
Every move that she makes



One smile and suddenly nobody else will do



You know you'll never be lonely
With you know who



One moment in her presence
And you can forget the rest



For the girl is second best to none, son



Ooh! Sigh! Give her your attention
Do I really have to mention?



She's the... She's the...



On my God, I'm on Broadway?
That's all I could say on that stage.



I did it.



...the one!



It's his masterpiece. I think he'd be thrilled.



I think he'd say,
"Thanks, Bob, for doing it again."



I really wanted this.



And so many people
did so much to help me get this,



And not only Joe Papp
and Marvin and Ed and Nick



And Jimmy and Bobby
and the nine orchestrators,



And Bobby Thomas and the cast
and my darling Donna McKechnie,



But everybody that I've had the opportunity
to work with in the theater.



I mean, they've all taught me things,
and I only wanted one thing.



To be a Broadway director, and I am.



And I wanted one moment and I have it,
and I thank you.



I am very grateful that you have come
to spend this kind of time.



I think that we're all pretty interesting,
and that all of you are pretty interesting.



And I think that maybe
there's a show in there somewhere



Which would be called A Chorus Line.
