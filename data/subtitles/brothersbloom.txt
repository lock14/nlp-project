1
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,451
As far as con man stories go,
I think I've heard them all.

2
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:40,622
Of grifters, ropers, faro-fixers,
tales drawn long and tall.

3
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,335
But if one bears a bookmark
in the confidence man's tome,

4
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:50,382
it would be that of Penelope,
and of the brothers Bloom.

5
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,677
At 10 and 13, Bloom and Stephen,

6
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,721
the younger and the old,

7
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,640
had been through several foster families.

8
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:00,976
No!

9
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,895
Thirty-eight, all told.

10
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,565
Mischief moved them on in life,

11
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,859
and moving kept them close.

12
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,820
For Bloom had Stephen,
and Stephen, Bloom,

13
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,031
and both had more than most.

14
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,701
Another home, another Main Street.

15
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,537
Stephen looked around
and summed the burg up thusly.

16
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,415
Bloom, we've hit a one-hat town.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,920
One theater. One carwash. One cafe.
One park. One cat,

18
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,881
which, through some mishap, had one leg.

19
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,008
Sweet Jesus. Look at that.

20
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,219
One public school,

21
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,305
one tight-knit group of
local well-off kids.

22
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,100
Their pocket-change bought rocket pops.

23
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,184
The brothers...

24
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,602
Pixy Stix.

25
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,524
They were the they, all well-loved,
rooted, happy as you please,

26
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,152
always there in every town.

27
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,072
Playground bourgeoisies.

28
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,971
Could he simply...

29
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,305
Talk to her!

30
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,725
Just drop his fears and go?

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,396
Leave his brother in the woods,
and join the children?

32
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,234
No.

33
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:37,447
So, in the root of Stephen's psyche,
something now began.

34
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,077
A seed of grand epiphany. A hook. A tale.

35
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,996
- A plan.
- A fiction,

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,291
both for profit
and to ease his brother's heart.

37
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,003
A simple con in 15 steps.

38
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,964
And this is where we start.

39
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:59,970
And then, as if a curtain
had been pulled back from the sky,

40
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,100
some barrier
within the younger Bloom was broken.

41
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,602
Hi.

42
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:13,358
So Bloom performed his role
in Stephen's story to a T.

43
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,362
And being who he wasn't,
could be as he wished to be.

44
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,549
So, the tale. You tell them...

45
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,052
There's a hermit in the woods.

46
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,096
A one-eyed, steel-toothed vagabond.

47
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,015
- With blood-red eyes?
- That's good.

48
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,309
He stopped you, coming home from school.

49
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,727
And told me of a cave.

50
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,062
What kind of cave?

51
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,064
A cave of wonder.

52
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,399
Shut up, Dave.

53
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,402
At noon on every Sunday,
there appears a ball of light,

54
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,655
which flutters, like a butterfly.

55
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,573
- Awill-o'-wisp?
- That's right.

56
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,783
It guides you...

57
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,992
If you can keep up...

58
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,494
...to where the treasures lay.

59
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,579
- So where's this cave?
- Yeah, where?

60
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,582
The hermit didn't say.

61
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:15,087
He got this greedy,
glinting look, the filthy red-eyed leech,

62
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,840
and said he'd tell for 30 bucks.

63
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,469
Well, that's just 2 bucks each!

64
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,642
And so that Sunday, straight from church,

65
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,311
into the woods Bloom led.

66
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:41,154
They stopped. Their hearts leapt.
There it was.

67
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,573
Just like the hermit said.

68
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,719
For just one moment,
Bloom forgot himself and ran too fast.

69
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,722
He'd catch the light and find the treasure,

70
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,809
but the moment passed.

71
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,410
They didn't catch the will-o'-wisp,
but didn't really care.

72
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,747
It seems to me that in the end,
the perfect con

73
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,209
is where each one involved
gets just the thing they wanted.

74
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,004
Yeah, I guess so.

75
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,715
Our fledgling thieves were satisfied.

76
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,761
The children's parents, less so.

77
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,936
A bitter ending? Maybe.

78
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,105
But there's sweetness in the mix.

79
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,317
The brothers Bloom had found their calling,

80
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,361
as shown in number six.

81
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,696
"Cut" meant to negotiate.

82
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,032
"Percent," percentage deal.

83
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,535
O'Henry's was the town's
one dry-clean shop.

84
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,830
Pleasure doing business with you.

85
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,043
So how's it feel?

86
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:23,590
In truth, young Bloom
won't know for 20 years just how he felt.

87
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,301
And so, we'll skip ahead now in our story.

88
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,844
Let 'em melt.

89
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,728
He gets the scarab,

90
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,481
you get the money, and I get the girl.

91
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,818
So in the end,
everyone gets everything he wants.

92
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,531
Victor!

93
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:37,205
Charleston, what have you done?
Oh, my God.

94
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,084
Oh, God, he's dead!

95
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,087
He was the only one who knew
where our money was buried,

96
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,133
and you shot him! Charleston, you dunce!

97
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,179
The man named Charleston that you met

98
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,347
four months and 1, 000 years ago

99
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,558
in a hotel bar in Jodhpur is dead.

100
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:01,146
If we see each other again,
it'll be as strangers.

101
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,815
As for the money,

102
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,070
let it rot.

103
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,686
Wow!

104
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,815
"Wow" is the word you're looking for! Wow!

105
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,736
You're a genius, Stephen.

106
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,738
We're genius, Bloom.

107
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,952
Now, in defense of that shit-eating
grin on my older brother's face,

108
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,704
what he just pulled off was pretty amazing.

109
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,749
He hinged the entire con on this question.

110
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,627
Would Charleston, our spineless mark,

111
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,296
would he actually pull that trigger?

112
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,049
Maybe.

113
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,676
But Stephen wanted better odds.

114
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,220
He positioned me in the same spot where,
six years ago,

115
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,889
Charleston's wife had stood
and told him she was leaving.

116
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,891
He picked my suit to match her outfit.

117
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,019
He even phonetically matched
my final words to hers.

118
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,313
This is the end, Charleston.

119
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,649
You've always been such a dunce.

120
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,027
So in the end,
everyone gets everything he wants.

121
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,531
Tastes like tinfoil.

122
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,074
So does real blood.

123
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,867
Buy you a drink?

124
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,749
Nine months and 1,000 years ago.

125
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,378
He was quoting from Kipling.
He stole that from Kipling.

126
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,338
No, he didn't.

127
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,299
So where's this wrap party?

128
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,719
Make way, make room
for the brothers Bloom!

129
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,598
Yeah, yeah!

130
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,519
All right, here we go.
Gather round, friends and accomplices.

131
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,564
Think of a card. You got it?

132
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,276
No.

133
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,653
If I do it enough,
someday it's gonna work on someone.

134
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,282
And then it'll be
the best damn card trick in the world.

135
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,119
It's true you never work
with the same crew twice?

136
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,121
Well, shit. Except for the...

137
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,205
Bang Bang?

138
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,875
You know, I'm pretty big into anime.

139
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,336
She's our fifth Beatle.

140
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,172
She knows the ins and outs.

141
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,634
I don't think she speaks
more than three words of English.

142
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,801
Campari.

143
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,763
So, she's with you and Bloom till the end?

144
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,723
Till the wind changes.

145
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,914
Where is Bloom?

146
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,388
There you are.

147
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,764
You hiding?

148
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,224
Yep.

149
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,267
I've been learning.

150
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,353
Stephen likes to talk about you.

151
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,397
He tell you the cave story?

152
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,981
Is it true?

153
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,110
What else did he tell you?

154
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,155
You two kicked around
until your early teens

155
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,867
winding up in the grotty outskirts
of St. Petersburg,

156
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:48,623
where you learned the big con from an
old-school grifter named the Diamond Dog.

157
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,458
Is that true?

158
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,961
- That was his name?
- Yep.

159
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,672
And he was your mentor.

160
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,800
But I get the sense it ended badly.

161
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,303
Stephen took his eye out
with an antique rapier.

162
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,597
Why did he do that?

163
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,142
The brothers Bloom lit out on their own

164
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,769
to make their fortune as gentleman thieves.

165
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,105
Sounds romantic.

166
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,482
It does.

167
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,537
You don't understand what my brother does.

168
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,502
He writes his cons
the way dead Russians write novels,

169
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,214
with thematic arcs
and embedded symbolism and shit.

170
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,677
And he wrote me as the vulnerable antihero.

171
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,183
And that's why you think you wanna kiss me.

172
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,187
It's a con.

173
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,695
I'm going nuts.

174
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,034
There's the big two.

175
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,880
We missed the sunrise.

176
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,008
That would have been nice.

177
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,063
Is this the bathroom?

178
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,775
No. This is camels.

179
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,195
Hold on, I must make piss.

180
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,175
At least you're honest.
All right, let's do this.

181
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,678
Let's just get it done. So, first you say,

182
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,848
"I'm quitting, Stephen.
I'm out." Then I say...

183
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,975
- Do we have to go through this again?
- "Go through this again?"

184
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,102
And then you make a show
of putting on your jacket,

185
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,521
and you say, "No,
I mean it this time, Stephen.

186
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,481
"This time, I'm really out."

187
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,108
And then you say, "Let's have a drink,"

188
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,987
"and in the morning, Bloom,
you'll have come to your senses."

189
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,447
It's a major design
flaw in fake blood, by the way.

190
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,449
- "And we'll be moving on."
- Real blood turns brown...

191
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,868
- Listen to me, Stephen. I...
- ...after half an hour.

192
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,661
This Scotch cost more than your suit.

193
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,912
Listen to me.

194
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,205
The flask stopped a bullet in Normandy.

195
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,456
Listen!

196
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,671
Holy shit.

197
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,884
That's my new favorite camel.

198
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,892
I hate you. Okay?

199
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,901
Oh, God, I can't do this anymore.

200
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,946
I can't wake up next to another person
who thinks they know me.

201
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,532
And I'm 35 years old. I don't...

202
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,826
I'm useless. I'm crippled.

203
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,745
I don't...

204
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,957
I've only ever lived life
through these roles that aren't me,

205
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,376
that are written for me by you.

206
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,005
Tell me what you want.

207
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,925
Why? So you can write me a role
in a story where I get it?

208
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,260
You're not listening to me!

209
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,181
I want a real thing.

210
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,351
I want a...

211
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,729
I just... l want... l... want...

212
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,486
- You want an unwritten life.
- I want an unwritten life.

213
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,951
I'm going away,

214
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,202
somewhere where you and Bang Bang

215
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,411
won't even be able to track me down.

216
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,706
So don't try it, okay? No more stories.

217
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,628
I love you. Goodbye.

218
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,222
How'd you find me?

219
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,473
Bang Bang.

220
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,935
How'd she find me?

221
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,772
How you been?

222
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,775
Great.

223
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,199
I've been doing a lot of thinking
the past three months,

224
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,286
and I've come to the conclusion
that you don't want out.

225
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,872
You think you do, but you don't.

226
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,043
Hey, come here.
I wanna show you something.

227
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,794
I'm quit, Stephen.

228
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,218
Where are we going?

229
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,595
New Jersey.

230
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,890
Let me grab my coat.

231
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,901
So, where are we?

232
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,945
The largest private residence
on the Eastern Seaboard,

233
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,239
home of our final mark.

234
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,366
Daddy was an oil tycoon, a Hearst type,

235
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,828
built a Xanadu to match,
then died hunting quail.

236
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,290
Mom followed
into the hereafter two years ago,

237
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,919
after 10 years of fighting a disease
that I can't even pronounce.

238
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:13,049
Thank you. Leaving our sucker all alone
on this ludicrous estate

239
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,260
with an insane amount
of very liquid assets.

240
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,596
What the hell is that?
What are we, near an airport? What is that?

241
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,806
Duck.

242
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,604
What the hell?

243
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,312
Get the car.

244
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,440
- Bloom.
- No women. One rule.

245
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,151
You know we don't do women.

246
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,236
And it's not a morality thing or a thing.

247
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,822
It's... Whatever it is,
it doesn't matter what it is,

248
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,909
it's just our rule. So what are we...
Is this a '78 Caddy?

249
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,203
Controversial choice.

250
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,874
So no, is what I'm saying, all right?
I'm quits, anyway.

251
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,293
I'll be in Montenegro, drinking.

252
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,674
Ah, Penelope Stamp, 33.

253
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,427
Lived at home her whole life.

254
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,142
An eccentric shut-in rich bitch?
You're not helping your case.

255
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,687
She's bored. She's a
little seed in the snow.

256
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,398
We're going to put her on a grand
adventure, bring her to life.

257
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,275
She needs sprouting.

258
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,697
So this is the big plan, huh?

259
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:05,536
Lure me back in with some beautiful,
intriguing, elusive girl.

260
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,502
Seriously, Stephen. Amateur night.

261
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,681
I'm not saying yes, but what's the con?

262
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,018
It's actually pretty simple.
We're brothers, antiquities dealers.

263
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,229
We're traveling the world by steamer ship.

264
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,941
Bang! Give her
the old cackle-bladder and the brush-off.

265
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,109
And that's how it ends in Mexico,

266
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,696
burst of violence,
then a moment of truth on the beach.

267
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,740
What do you think?

268
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,659
You got something up your sleeve.

269
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:49,247
This is about me, right? Somehow.

270
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,752
Now, this might not be
something that you know,

271
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,171
but they've all been about you.

272
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,384
Maybe that's why they've none been perfect,

273
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:05,429
because I've never been
able to give you what you really wanted.

274
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,474
This isn't gonna give me what I want.

275
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,532
This will be the last one.

276
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,868
You'll let me go.

277
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,288
I'll never ask you to do another con again.

278
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,918
Make it a Schwinn.

279
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,560
There are less painful ways
to cut into a mark, you know.

280
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,564
Score to beat is 7.9.

281
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,484
Keep your head in the game.
The Japanese judge is very tough.

282
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,695
This is a banana seat, man!

283
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,948
Don't give me that blank look,

284
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,326
you know what a goddamn banana seat is.

285
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,618
Oh!

286
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,460
Shit.

287
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,845
Shit!

288
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,565
There's actually a knack to this.

289
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,693
If you're trying to fast track
into a mark's sympathies,

290
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,112
there's nothing quite as effective

291
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,531
as having your first conversation

292
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,951
be from a hospital bed they put you in.

293
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,259
What? Oh, come on.

294
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,688
I actually think this is kind of
a great thing, and I'll tell you why.

295
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,441
Dostoevsky was an epileptic.

296
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,986
His seizures were preceded
by an enlightened euphoria,

297
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,280
a soft of opening of his spiritual eye.

298
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:13,200
I think the fact that she saw your face
the instant before a seizure

299
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,037
is a pretty goddamn good foot
to start things off on, right?

300
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,962
The next step,

301
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,174
is to figure out a way to insinuate
yourself into their personal life.

302
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:35,181
I think they took my car.
Could you drive me home?

303
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,060
- Yeah.
- Okay.

304
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,605
I'm gonna...

305
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,541
Step three, engagement.

306
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,503
Find a connection with your mark
through conversation.

307
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,506
Get invited in for coffee.
Tell them the full tale.

308
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,007
Set your hook.

309
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,052
...didn't really have anyone
except each other growing up,

310
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:17,556
and our father was in the antique business.
He had a shop in Charleston.

311
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,018
We realized one day we saw the dealers

312
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,938
who were finding and
selling us the antiques

313
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,942
coming from exotic countries,

314
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,945
around the world, and...

315
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,323
The air would, like,

316
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,035
before a rain, you know,
the ions would line up,

317
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,162
and you could just

318
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,502
smell midnight trains to Paris

319
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,799
and steamer ships
and Calcutta bazaars, and...

320
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,848
It could... Excuse me; I'm sorry, uh...

321
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,934
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

322
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,395
- Sorry.
- Okay. All right.

323
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,063
I'm really bad at talking to people.

324
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,731
That's okay.

325
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,903
You want me to go?

326
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,823
No. No, I really want to talk to you.

327
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,381
So...

328
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,552
What kind of stuff do you do?

329
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,640
Nothing. Maybe you should go.

330
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,268
All right, I'll just finish my...

331
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,020
I collect hobbies.

332
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,315
I see someone doing something I like,

333
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,942
and I get books and I learn how to do it.

334
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,068
Hmm.

335
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,030
Anything interesting?

336
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,241
Not really.

337
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,147
Like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a...

338
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,316
- I really am not comfortable with this at all.
- I throw my right chainsaw...

339
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,902
- This is a running chainsaw.
- ...into the air and I will catch.

340
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,915
You just learn this stuff here by yourself?

341
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,543
Kind of sad?

342
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,836
No.

343
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,967
So, how do you plan to
use all these skills?

344
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,554
I don't know. I'm not a planner.
I just do stuff.

345
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:08,185
Like, look at this watermelon.
It's a pinhole camera.

346
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,398
You can make a pinhole camera
out of anything hollow and dark.

347
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,652
It's gotta warp the image though, right?

348
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,612
Yeah, yeah it does.

349
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,447
I mean, that's what's good about it.

350
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,075
I mean, you could point this baby

351
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,244
at the most menial, everyday little thing,

352
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,372
like the fabric, or you're...

353
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,209
Your face, or anything,

354
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,503
and depending on
how the pinhole eats the light,

355
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:39,425
it's gonna be warped and peculiar
and imperfect and odd,

356
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,928
and it's not gonna be reproduction,

357
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:46,014
it's storytelling.

358
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,560
It's a lie that tells the truth.

359
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,603
I don't know about truths.

360
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,356
A photograph is a secret about a secret.

361
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,817
The more it tells you, less you know.

362
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,238
What's changed between now
and 20 minutes ago?

363
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,700
'Cause this is sort of like a conversation.

364
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,455
Well, shit.

365
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,095
Throw my ticket out the window.

366
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,018
Throw my suitcase out there, too.

367
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,358
Throw my troubles out the door

368
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,236
I don't need them anymore.

369
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,239
'Cause tonight I'll be
staying here with you.

370
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,116
Well...

371
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,576
I should...

372
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,329
It's late.

373
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,623
- So...
- So...

374
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,586
I meet a lot of people in my job

375
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,880
I have to professionally act interested in.

376
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:05,385
It's a good feeling
to be genuinely interested in someone.

377
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,389
Are you leaving?

378
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,392
Yeah.

379
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Oh.

380
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,354
Coming back?

381
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,898
Well, next time I'm in town.

382
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,568
We're taking a steamer at noon tomorrow
off the docks,

383
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,862
to the continent for a few months.

384
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,989
Paris and Greece, I think.

385
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,952
I've got to get a hat.

386
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:34,164
Well, thanks for
the pinhole camera demonstration.

387
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,918
And the good conversation.

388
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,964
All right.

389
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,094
Goodbye, Penelope.

390
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,221
Goodbye, Bloom.

391
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,032
She isn't coming, man.
I need another day with her.

392
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,784
You'll have two weeks with her on the boat.

393
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,703
I need another day to get her on the boat.

394
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,496
She's not hooked. I've had one session,

395
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,208
and we mostly talked watermelons
and the optics of lensless photography.

396
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,961
It's not the talking that hooked her.

397
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,296
I think you're wrong.

398
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,881
Hey, get out of the street, idiot!

399
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,300
Watch it!

400
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,144
- Hey.
- Hi.

401
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,774
What are you doing here?

402
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,859
Uh...

403
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:51,408
I wanna give you this money
for the bike and for the whole thing.

404
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,661
- That's all right. It's not necessary, really.
- Oh.

405
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,752
Hey, where is this boat going?

406
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,361
Penelope, my brother Stephen.

407
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,613
Glad to make your acquaintance.

408
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,323
Bloom's told me so much about you.

409
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,951
You're the epileptic photographer?

410
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,369
Sort of.

411
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,955
And this is my personal assistant

412
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,750
and private masseuse, Mrs. Yueng Ling.

413
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,710
Yuengling like the beer?

414
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,295
No.

415
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,344
So, what are your plans in Greece?

416
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,554
- I don't plan.
- Good for you.

417
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:14,408
When they begin the beguine.

418
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:21,039
It brings back the sound
of music so tender.

419
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,250
You look very nice.

420
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:28,088
It brings back a night
of tropical splendor.

421
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:33,844
It brings back a memory of green.

422
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,433
What was your childhood like?

423
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,602
I made cameras out of watermelons.

424
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,647
Lonely?

425
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:55,157
When I was five, I got really bad rashes
and allergies and hay fever.

426
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,618
So my mom took me to the doctor,

427
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,620
and he did that test

428
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,124
where they use needles
to prick a grid on your back

429
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,585
with different toxins on them, you know,

430
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,879
to see which ones you're allergic to.

431
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,923
Next day I come in,
the doctor lifts up my shift,

432
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,884
and my back is a patch of oily, moldy,

433
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,720
blackish-green double-puff marshmallows.

434
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,848
I was allergic to everything.

435
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,185
So they sealed the house with plastic

436
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,395
and a special ventilation system,

437
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,066
and I spent the rest of my childhood
and adolescence indoors.

438
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,609
Alone.

439
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,861
Lonely.

440
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,572
- Wow.
- It wasn't till I was 19

441
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:40,827
they discovered what I was
actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy

442
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,663
the hypodermic needles were made out of.

443
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,375
Then I was gonna leave,

444
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,004
but my mom got sick. So I stayed.

445
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:55,008
She stayed sick a really long time.

446
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,427
Do you...

447
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,847
Feel cheated?

448
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,227
The trick to not feeling cheated
is to learn how to cheat.

449
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,104
So,

450
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:11,441
I decided this wasn't a story
about a miserable girl

451
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,986
trapped in a house that
smelled like medical supplies,

452
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:19,950
wasting her life on a dying person
she sometimes hated. No.

453
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:26,665
This was a story about a girl who could
find infinite beauty in anything,

454
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,209
any little thing.

455
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,046
And even love the person
she was trapped with.

456
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,551
And I told myself this story
until it became true.

457
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:44,724
Now, did doing this help me
escape a wasted life,

458
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:49,146
or did it blind me
so I wouldn't want to escape it?

459
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,315
I don't know. But either way,

460
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,193
I was the one telling my own story, so...

461
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,739
No, I don't feel cheated at all.

462
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,672
I don't suppose in all
your hobby-acquiring,

463
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,008
you ever learned how to dance?

464
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,429
I went through a phase when I was mildly
obsessed with the bolero.

465
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,556
Give me a minute.

466
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,973
It's a long time since I last encountered
the brothers Bloom.

467
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,977
Are you in antiques?

468
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,942
Antique?

469
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:22,530
I wonder, my dear, if you know
the true nature of the men you travel with.

470
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,874
A little fear might suit you, I think.

471
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,854
It isn't a Spanish band,
but they'll do their best.

472
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,572
Mmm...

473
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,880
And then... This is the
really important part.

474
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,757
You have to make a little,
itty-bitty, little hole.

475
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,518
The ship's too small for us
to be dancing around each other.

476
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,104
We might as well have this out now.

477
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,982
Penelope, do you know our friend?

478
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,526
Only as the creepy Frenchman.

479
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,945
Book-learned. You know your languages

480
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,572
but not your accents, mademoiselle.

481
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,116
- No, I am Belgian.
- Ah.

482
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,203
Maximilian Melville, at your service.

483
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,915
Also known in certain professional circles
as The Curator.

484
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,709
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
What do you do?

485
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:44,798
I am a curator, presently at
the National Musee in Prague.

486
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,508
Yeah. And yourself?

487
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,259
I'm an epileptic photographer.

488
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:52,639
Good for you. And you boys?
What do you do?

489
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,475
We run a legitimate
antique reselling business.

490
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,559
Ah.

491
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,065
We've gone straight, Max.

492
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:06,653
Pardon, but why would you ascend to
the great heights of the brothers Bloom

493
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,447
just to toss it away, huh? To do what?

494
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:14,327
To sell terra cotta
to blue-haired weekend antiquers?

495
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,330
- I don't think so.
- We did. Eat your waffles.

496
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,502
You know, the mademoiselle,
she seems a little confused.

497
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,087
Maybe she is unawares?

498
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,672
Eat your waffles, fat man.

499
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,634
Unawares that the brothers Bloom, in fact,

500
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,888
are the two most respected

501
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,184
smugglers of antiques in the Western world.

502
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,814
Were. We've been on the straight
for three years. So that's that.

503
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:47,026
Oh, oh. Well, if that is that,
then that indeed is that. If you say so.

504
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,404
Oh.

505
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,533
- Your name's Melville.
- Oui, vrai.

506
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,535
Right.

507
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,415
No, sorry, um, 'cause I noticed
before but I couldn't place it.

508
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,083
This ship is called the Fidele,

509
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:07,213
which is the name of the ship
in Melville's novel, The Confidence-Man.

510
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,467
- So that's weird.
- Oui.

511
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,724
I have never read that.

512
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:27,275
Smugglers. It's like an adventure story.

513
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,987
Whose idea was it to go straight?

514
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,741
Mine. Stephen always loved the life.

515
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,078
Then he was almost killed
on a run to Jakafta.

516
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,665
These two thugs
with heads like canned hams

517
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,542
worked him beyond all reason.

518
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,337
Have at me, you ham-headed bastard!

519
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,464
Shit!

520
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,051
Sometimes I think he'd
love to die on a job.

521
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,429
Cornered at midnight on a run to Jakarta.

522
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,265
That's his dream,

523
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,602
to tell a story so well it fulfills itself.

524
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,522
Somehow.

525
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:10,026
It would finally make it real for him.

526
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,154
That's kind of the thing we all want.

527
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:21,037
Well, trying to get something real by
telling yourself stories is a trap.

528
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,915
Trust me on that one.

529
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,722
She's different. She knows...

530
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,310
Sometimes I feel like she knows everything.

531
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,563
Doesn't that worry you?

532
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,275
No, but something about her
is worrying you plenty.

533
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,945
She feels like one of your characters.

534
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,371
The day I con you is the day I die, Bloom.

535
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,127
How'd you get the Belgian on our budget?

536
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,337
He's beautiful, right?

537
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,423
I didn't expect him to actually be Belgian.

538
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,009
I'm not sure he is. I'm off to bed.

539
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,845
Hey.

540
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,016
The only real danger in this whole play

541
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,602
is that you actually fall in love with her.

542
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,353
Hey, look at me.

543
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,607
Mexico is closer than you think.

544
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,776
Don't fall in love with her, Bloom.

545
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,918
Good luck, boys, with the antiquing, huh.

546
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,479
My French is a little rusty,

547
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:13,149
but I believe he said,
"My proposition stands."

548
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,693
He came out of nowhere last night.

549
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,404
Mademoiselle, I will
make you a proposition.

550
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,156
Oh, Lord. What has he got?

551
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,158
An 8th-century prayer book.

552
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,535
He steals pieces from his museum in Prague,

553
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,621
and sells them off through smugglers.

554
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,789
That's what he does.

555
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,207
I wonder who's his fence?

556
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,667
It's probably his Spanish guy, right?

557
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:31,709
Did he say who's buying?

558
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,254
Yeah, an Argentinean. Argentine? Argent...

559
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,632
A gentleman from the Argentine.

560
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:42,887
So, The Curator will sell it to a middleman
for $1 million US,

561
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:47,475
and then the Argentine...
The guy from South America,

562
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,311
he will pay $2.5.

563
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,523
It's not bad.

564
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,818
I'm sorry you had to deal with that guy.

565
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,612
Where's that cab going?

566
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,781
Train station.

567
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,449
Where's the train going?

568
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,701
Prague.

569
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,248
Come on! Let's be smugglers.

570
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,875
I mean, I think it'd be fun.
We should do this.

571
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,836
- No.
- Why not?

572
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,213
Well, first off, we don't have $1 million.

573
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,007
That's like, I've got, what...
That's whatever.

574
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,634
I mean, give me a real reason.

575
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,594
This is real. It's dangerous.

576
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,849
- This could go very bad.
- Hmm.

577
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,394
Well, I think
a little real danger might suit me,

578
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,063
so, if you three want to join
my smugglers gang,

579
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,691
I'll, you know, consider it.

580
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,446
This isn't an adventure story.

581
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,407
What are you talking about?

582
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,492
Well, it totally is!

583
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,134
Go, go, go. Go, go.

584
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,427
You there, come back here!

585
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,096
This is not for free.

586
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:17,774
Wait up. Where are you?

587
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,859
Come here. Come here.

588
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,572
We're smuggling.

589
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,951
From the snack car.

590
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,624
She's making a flag
for our smugglers gang, man.

591
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,794
This afternoon, when she was
writing in the observation car,

592
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,004
I thought she was writing
a letter, a journal.

593
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,507
No. Come on, she's getting
way too into this.

594
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,928
It's not funny. I don't like this
Prague con you've cooked up, either.

595
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,638
You're just leaving too much to chance.

596
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,847
Listen, the whole point of this

597
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,557
was to sweep her off her feet.

598
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,392
So why don't you let her enjoy it?

599
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,061
While it lasts?

600
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,864
This came through just now?

601
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,201
"Dear Stephen. Stop.
Word on the wire is..."

602
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:13,037
"...The brothers B.
Are bound for Prague.

603
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,622
"I'm heading there myself.

604
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:18,835
"Would love to see my boys.
Affectionately, D. D."

605
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,421
Our old Fagin is back. The Diamond Dog.

606
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,757
Wire him back for me.

607
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,551
Dear Dog. Stop.

608
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,762
Unless you feel an excess of eyeballs
left in your skull,

609
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,808
I highly suggest you stay far away from
me and my brother. Stop.

610
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,562
Affectionately... Et cetera.

611
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,909
You've taken this train before?

612
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,786
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

613
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,415
So this is all just like,
"Whatever" to you.

614
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,834
Well, I mean, usually, I'd just, you know,

615
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,378
play cards and drink with Bang Bang
in the snack car.

616
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,796
Bang who?

617
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,550
Yueng Ling.

618
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,052
- Bang Bang's her smuggler nickname.
- Ah.

619
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,638
So how about me?

620
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,307
Do I get a smuggler nickname?

621
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,558
No.

622
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,109
I think you're constipated.

623
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,195
In your fucking soul.

624
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,952
I think

625
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:40,791
you might have a really big load of grumpy,
petrified poop up your soul's ass.

626
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,794
- What?
- Bloom, I know.

627
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,380
I'm pretending to be a smuggler.

628
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,508
Right?

629
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,178
But what you don't know is,

630
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:57,183
I am a full-on smuggler.

631
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,020
'Cause I tell it like I own it.

632
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:06,692
You know what your problem is?
You just got to stop thinking so much.

633
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,862
I mean, just enjoy the ride, man.

634
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,697
I mean...

635
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,668
I love thunderstorms.

636
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,785
Oh, my God. I'm just so horny.

637
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,578
Goodnight.

638
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,843
Here's the big two.

639
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:26,272
Last time I was in Prague, I was in love.

640
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,107
What was she like?

641
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,944
Pale skin, long feet.

642
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,947
So...

643
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,534
And that's mine.

644
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:43,039
Bloom and I will secure lodging.

645
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,128
Miss Yueng Ling will scout out the museum.

646
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,088
You will go to the bank.

647
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,883
That wire should have cleared
if you put it in at Athens.

648
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,302
- Cash?
- No.

649
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,848
Only movie thugs and Russians
deal in suitcases of cash.

650
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,100
You're gonna get a certified check.

651
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,817
Who the hell is that?
Who is it?

652
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,819
A Candy-gram.

653
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,696
Max, it's us, for Christ's sake.

654
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:17,823
Whoa!

655
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,497
- Max! Max, it's us, Bloom.
- Max! It's Stephen and Bloom.

656
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,457
- Jesus, Max, easy...
- Jesus, whoa!

657
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,958
Whoa, now!

658
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,502
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good morning.

659
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,297
Come in. I have been drinking, you know.

660
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,510
So,

661
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:45,976
beside the basilica,
there are the offices of administration.

662
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,774
And underneath them,
and otherwise totally inaccessible,

663
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,318
there's a little section of catacombs.

664
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,279
And of course, the book.

665
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,699
But I am the curator, so I just walk in

666
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,160
and I pinch the copy girl's babouche.

667
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,705
I slip the book into my
briefcase, and I leave.

668
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,627
About 2:00 tomorrow, say?

669
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,594
It is you who I do business with, oui?

670
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,180
Right.

671
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,185
Oh, right.

672
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,191
Your smile is the sun, ma chere.

673
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,738
And fallen men, we need the sun.

674
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:21,006
Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a cane.

675
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,343
Bloom.

676
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,138
Bloom, Bloom, Bloom.

677
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,893
How long has it been?

678
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,020
Mmm?

679
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,981
Tea.

680
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,859
Can you believe it? Tea.

681
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,988
Been a long time, huh?

682
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,115
If I call Stephen down
here, he'll kill you.

683
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:50,035
You're terrified, huh? Don't be scared.

684
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,329
I'm an old man

685
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,834
with no depth perception.

686
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,378
You don't have to be scared of me.

687
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,842
You know, it's been a funny thing,

688
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:10,097
watching you boys take
what I taught you and eclipse me.

689
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,266
I am so proud

690
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:17,604
to be a footnote
in the life of the brothers Bloom.

691
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,856
But you

692
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,359
hate me.

693
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:31,243
You probably won't believe,
but I loved you both very much.

694
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,912
But love...

695
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,084
You know, folks like us,

696
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:43,088
you can always
blink and realize that it's a fiction.

697
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:48,302
And like Pete walking on water
or Wile E. Coyote running off a cliff,

698
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:51,096
if you look down in doubt,

699
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,224
you will fall.

700
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:01,565
That's the price of our lives,
the wax in our wings.

701
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,611
One day, Stephen's going to fall.

702
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:10,199
It may be glorious,
but he's going to fall hard,

703
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:14,161
and he won't be there to tell
you what to do, to protect you.

704
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,790
And without him, what would you do?

705
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:21,543
I remember all the other boys
when I went for the belt.

706
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,422
They would run. They would fight.
But not you.

707
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:29,093
You were so passive, paralyzed.

708
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:34,765
This is a warning, Bloom, and an offer.

709
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,683
When he's gone,

710
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,520
remember me.

711
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,026
Oh!

712
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,403
Stephen.

713
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,489
We were just talking about you.

714
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,993
Fuck you!

715
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,611
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

716
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,322
You can't always be there.

717
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,535
Yeah, I guess I can't.

718
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,515
Max!

719
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,230
Aren't we a little early?

720
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,822
Well, he's gone, that's for sure.

721
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,658
Probably halfway around the world by now.

722
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,952
Aren't you a wee bit early...

723
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,038
I don't get it.

724
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,248
If he was hightailing it,
why didn't he just wait eight hours

725
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,626
until we traded the book for the million,

726
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,086
then he'd a had some walking-around money.

727
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,133
Oh, well, back to antiquing.

728
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,719
Nothing lost, nothing gained.

729
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:36,803
Oh.

730
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,769
"Oh?"

731
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,026
The check was cashed yesterday afternoon.

732
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,321
He would have deposited it
in a Swiss account by now.

733
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,532
I'm sorry, Pen. I'm sorry.

734
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,742
Such a waste.

735
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:05,082
Poor man. Poor Argentina man.

736
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,211
I mean, he's never gonna
even see that book now.

737
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:12,965
It's just gonna rot away
in those catacombs.

738
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,678
No.

739
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,555
There is no book, all right.
We've been swindled.

740
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,015
Well, maybe there is. Maybe it's real.

741
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,477
- It's not real, it's a con.
- No.

742
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:28,897
You know what? It's my money,
so I'm going to find out for sure.

743
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,483
He gave us every piece
of information we need.

744
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,570
Well, we'd have to clear
the administrative offices.

745
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,446
Some sort of...

746
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,536
Disruption.

747
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:56,842
She's an artist with nitroglycerin.
It's kind of her thing.

748
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,428
I feel like I want to know more about her.

749
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,596
Yeah.

750
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:07,185
A few years back,
when we hit the top of our smuggling game,

751
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,354
she just appeared.

752
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:13,025
And we figure someday
she'll just disappear.

753
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,944
Check out the tat on the back of her neck.

754
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,864
It's an inky wisp of personal information.

755
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,866
Essentially, it means,

756
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:24,369
"When you're done with something,
blow it up."

757
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:38,008
The smoke detector is in
these empty rooms in the east tower.

758
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,302
We're gonna plant and
set off a tiny, tiny...

759
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,805
Tiny charge.

760
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,645
A puff of smoke
sets off the fire alarm in the rafters.

761
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,147
Fire drill ensues, offices empty.

762
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,690
Excuse me.

763
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,400
You have exactly four and a half minutes

764
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,320
to get through the access hatch,
into the catacombs,

765
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,948
grab the book and get out
before the fire brigade arrives.

766
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:05,994
The abort code, in case we have to abort,
is "corned beef."

767
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,705
For some reason.

768
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,333
Okay,
so she blows this one up.

769
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,251
This is Yueng Ling's backpack?

770
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,628
Yeah.

771
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,091
You know what I feel?

772
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,718
Horny?

773
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,553
Scared.

774
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,307
And all my big talk,
showing off all the time.

775
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:30,394
But, I mean, this isn't a story,

776
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,771
it's real.

777
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,108
It's freaky scary.

778
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,738
Well, as long as you focus on,

779
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,157
you know, second left, third right.

780
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,684
Okay.

781
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,194
All right?

782
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:46,780
Okay.

783
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,376
You know, for the record,
I'm still against this.

784
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,794
Why send her in alone?

785
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:04,256
Because going in alone
is a very important thing to do.

786
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:10,220
Listen, she's walking into
a tourism office during a fire drill

787
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:14,391
and taking a phony manuscript
from a lousy crawlspace.

788
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,853
Worst-case scenario,
a file clerk asks her if she's lost,

789
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,063
which isn't even gonna happen.

790
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,735
Okay, she's in position.

791
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,825
Because no one's gonna
even know we were ever here.

792
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,007
Fuck me.

793
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:02,564
Come on, don't do it.
Don't, don't, don't...

794
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:19,873
Abort! Corned beef, corned beef!

795
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,106
Wait, wait. We're fine. We're fine.
She's fine.

796
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,525
Listen, if the soldiers find
her wandering the halls

797
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:14,154
they'll assume she's a clerk.
They'll just shoo her out.

798
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:18,199
So as long as she doesn't
do anything suspicious, she's fine.

799
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:32,023
Oh, no.

800
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,650
It's the chief of police.

801
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,694
The chief of police!

802
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,455
Thank you.

803
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,175
I have, at different points in my life,

804
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:44,179
quite literally sold ice to an Eskimo
and sand to an Arab.

805
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,056
But I have no idea
what she could have said to that man

806
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,101
to have sweet-talked her way
out of that castle.

807
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,811
I could ask her.

808
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,688
How obtuse.

809
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,943
Let her sleep. Train
doesn't leave until 8:00.

810
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:05,700
That was real.

811
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,118
Yeah, I know.

812
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:10,121
Huh...

813
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,081
Freaky scary.

814
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,543
Miles from nowhere.

815
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:18,671
Guess I'll take my time.

816
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,091
Oh, yeah.

817
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,803
To reach there.

818
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,974
Look up at the mountain

819
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,520
I have to climb.

820
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,856
Oh, yeah.

821
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,318
To reach there.

822
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,947
Lord, my body.

823
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,575
It's been a good friend

824
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,870
I won't need it.

825
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:53,915
When I reach the end

826
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,585
Miles from nowhere.

827
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,089
Guess I'll take my time.

828
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,884
Oh, yeah.

829
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,012
To reach there

830
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,521
I creep through the valleys.

831
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:19,315
And I grope through the woods.

832
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:22,902
'Cause I know when I find it, my honey.

833
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,698
It's gonna make me feel good, yes.

834
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,867
An apple.

835
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,080
Yeah, it was part of an epiphany.

836
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,292
I love everything.

837
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:40,295
So don't it make you feel sad.

838
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:43,298
'Cause I'll drink to you, my baby.

839
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:48,511
I'll think to that Yes, I'll think to that.

840
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:51,347
I'll think to that

841
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,603
Miles from nowhere.

842
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:02,108
Guess I'll take my time.

843
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,154
Oh, yeah.

844
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,699
To reach there

845
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,204
Mexico.

846
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,877
Okay, we're rendezvousing
with the Argentina guys here,

847
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:24,339
on a isolated beach
just south of the Hotel Tampico.

848
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:25,757
A simple handoff.

849
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,343
Penelope, you and Yueng Ling
stay with the car,

850
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:31,179
Bloom and I will be doing the handing.

851
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:32,847
You guys seem a little tense.

852
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:37,393
Well, I'm not thrilled
they set this in Mexico.

853
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:41,522
There could be legitimate reasons,
but Mexico's...

854
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,359
And I don't like to simplistically vilify
an entire country,

855
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,652
but Mexico's a horrible place.

856
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:50,740
So we'll be careful.

857
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:10,176
This is gonna be dangerous tomorrow, right?

858
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:12,136
Yeah.

859
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,057
You should sleep at the hotel tonight.

860
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,892
I'll stay with Stephen at the beach house.

861
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,811
But you'll need sleep.

862
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:25,733
I'm really happy right now. Are you?

863
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:30,029
Right now I am.

864
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:36,119
I wanna be a smoggier
smuggle by day, drink by night.

865
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,579
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

866
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,149
The last box in our last con.

867
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,734
How's it feel?

868
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:33,050
Hey, what's up?

869
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:40,975
Bloom! What?

870
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,572
My brother and I are con men.

871
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,075
And...

872
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:03,414
Everything since you hit me
with your Lamborghini,

873
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,209
it's all fake, it's all

874
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,462
a con.

875
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,512
Stephen's gone into town
to prep the Argentina actors.

876
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:18,679
Money's in his place.

877
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,933
Money? I don't want the
money, let's just go.

878
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,608
Come on, come on.

879
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:41,744
You have to
switch it on at the base.

880
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,135
So, I told her our whole play.

881
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:02,473
And I'm here to take her money back.

882
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:06,269
How does that make you feel?

883
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:09,564
Disappointed.

884
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:11,399
This isn't the ending you wanted?

885
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:16,487
What does that matter?
This is the way it ends now.

886
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:20,157
So I might as well just get it over with.

887
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,409
- Where's the money?
- I ate it.

888
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:23,452
- Give me the money, Stephen.
- No.

889
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:24,787
I don't want the money.

890
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:27,039
He's not gonna keep a single piece of you.
Give me the money.

891
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:30,334
I'm sorry you fell in love with her.
She's a mark.

892
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:33,296
And all of this, all of it is just a con.

893
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,423
And every moment you share with her,

894
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:38,009
you're just playing the part
of a man falling in love.

895
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,678
That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

896
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,472
That you don't know the difference.

897
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,683
Or maybe that there
really is no difference.

898
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,685
That that's what love is, right?

899
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,354
Okay, we're leaving.

900
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:51,897
No.

901
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,692
You're too scared to leave.

902
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:57,194
You're too scared to ride
off into the sunset,

903
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,155
because real sunsets might be beautiful

904
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:01,907
but they turn into dark, uncertain nights.

905
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:06,746
No, you're not ready,
otherwise you wouldn't be here right now.

906
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,792
The money is in my bedroom.
It's right behind me.

907
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,963
But in my story you don't get the money
or the sunset or the girl.

908
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,217
Bloom,

909
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,804
let's just go.

910
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,515
Please.

911
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,398
Please?

912
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,104
Tastes like tinfoil.

913
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,203
I'm sorry.

914
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,376
Shh. Shh. Shh.

915
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,799
Get out of here.

916
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,386
Take the car and go.

917
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,098
I'm not going anywhere.

918
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:31,992
The storm is passed
There is peace at last.

919
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:37,414
I've spent my whole life sleeping.

920
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:42,002
Now there's not a sound.

921
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:46,674
No one to be found anywhere.

922
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:57,184
A shepherd and a sheep
will wind you to sleep.

923
01:20:57,894 --> 01:21:03,274
Where else on earth would you rather go?

924
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:09,572
To a land of wonder when you go under.

925
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:12,908
Why would we want

926
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:18,289
to come back at all?

927
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,151
Hey.

928
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,362
How'd you find me?

929
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:51,447
Bang Bang.

930
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:53,115
How'd you find Bang Bang?

931
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:56,744
She gave me her number
when we were in Mexico. Her cell.

932
01:21:57,203 --> 01:21:58,537
Bang Bang has a cell phone?

933
01:21:58,622 --> 01:21:59,747
Yeah.

934
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:04,543
I think she's kind of selective in
who she gives her number to.

935
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:12,718
Why are you here, Penelope?

936
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:16,764
Okay.

937
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:22,853
Well, l...

938
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:27,399
I've had a lot of time, you know,

939
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,276
to think, these past three months

940
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:35,199
and I want you to seriously consider this.

941
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:56,804
Go away.

942
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,726
Everything Stephen said was true.

943
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:04,937
I was just playing you as a mark.

944
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:09,024
Okay? Everything between us,

945
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,237
none of it was real.

946
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,448
Okay.

947
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,171
I don't believe you.

948
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:02,286
I let you do your monologue,
but you wanna know why?

949
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:05,456
I let her believe everything you said,

950
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,791
so she'd never want to see me again.

951
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:11,253
Get her away from all this for good.

952
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:35,486
- You wanna tell me what I'm doing here?
- You knew she'd come back.

953
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:39,823
What did you figure she was good for,
another million?

954
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,742
$1 .75 million.

955
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:47,831
Look, of course she came back.

956
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,667
She never got what she wanted.

957
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:53,253
Neither did you.

958
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,464
All right, look, we're gonna end this.

959
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:57,466
You built us into this,
you're gonna fly us out,

960
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:59,593
you're gonna end it, so
she's done with this.

961
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:02,387
End it all so she can't start up again.

962
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:07,101
Are you sure that's what you want?

963
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,853
I love her.

964
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,360
I don't want to turn her into me.

965
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,513
Well, we can't do the next job

966
01:25:44,597 --> 01:25:46,932
until we liquidate our assets
from the last job.

967
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:49,143
Uh-uh, you've got my million
from the last job, so...

968
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:52,396
That's profit, not capital,
the three of us already split that up.

969
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:56,567
So, step number one
is to sell the book of hours.

970
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,026
Ah.

971
01:25:58,611 --> 01:26:02,072
The one that you told me was fake, right?

972
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,449
Actually, with all your random expertise,

973
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:06,743
we couldn't risk a flat-out fake.

974
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:11,331
But to get top dollar,
we'll have to sell it deep black market.

975
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:15,752
And there's only one place
that's deep enough for that.

976
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:17,713
Where?

977
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,182
- Who'd you get, anyway?
- Hmm?

978
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:30,100
To play the Russians.

979
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:37,858
My boys.

980
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:42,321
I don't understand.

981
01:26:42,405 --> 01:26:46,033
We're sending Penelope off into the sunset,
that's what we're doing.

982
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:47,242
Why is he here?

983
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:50,954
We need someone to pass for the
Russian mob to sell our fake book to.

984
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,873
The Dog has his big store right here
in Saint Petersburg.

985
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:54,666
All right, stop.

986
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:56,960
I hate him, Stephen.

987
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:59,796
But this isn't that.

988
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,048
This is I don't trust him.

989
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:03,050
Yeah, what's he gonna do?

990
01:27:03,134 --> 01:27:05,636
Steal our fake money?

991
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,638
I have thought this through, believe me.

992
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:10,015
And we can't end it without him.

993
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:16,480
Trust me. It's gonna be okay.

994
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:25,739
Stephen,
still the grand architect.

995
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:31,662
Your symbols, red for temptation,
white for salvation.

996
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,458
And our hero must face the Minotaur
before he escapes the maze.

997
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:37,542
Uh-huh.

998
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,878
Pickup will be at your store.

999
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,881
Scare her,
think a movie version of the Russian mob,

1000
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:45,050
but don't hassle the girl.

1001
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:47,719
The girl? What's her name?

1002
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:49,805
You don't need to know her name.

1003
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,142
I know it. Penelope.

1004
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,437
I look forward to meeting the lady.

1005
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:00,107
All right, here we go.

1006
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:02,776
We got the back windshield
wired to explode,

1007
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:05,737
and there's a large charge
underneath the hood.

1008
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:09,157
After the handoff with the Dog,
we drive out of town.

1009
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:11,326
Late that night, we stop at a gas station

1010
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:13,704
where our fake Russians double-cross us,

1011
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:16,123
and kill us all in a moonlight ambush.

1012
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:20,252
We all die. Bloom takes a bullet
so Penelope can escape.

1013
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,671
The end.

1014
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,465
Okay.

1015
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,222
You've been awfully quiet.

1016
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:40,480
I'm doing this for her, you know.

1017
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:55,495
Tomorrow is the big day.

1018
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:34,534
Get down!

1019
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,527
- Out!
- Come on, come on.

1020
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,612
Get out, get out.

1021
01:31:03,749 --> 01:31:06,084
Bloom! Bloom.

1022
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:11,548
What happened?

1023
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:12,674
You okay?

1024
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:16,678
What happened? Where's Stephen?

1025
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:19,222
Stephen?

1026
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:20,765
I think...

1027
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,310
Bloom, I think they might have got him,

1028
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:26,354
because I think they double-crossed us
or something,

1029
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:30,150
because, you know,
I think they got Stephen, but...

1030
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:31,818
- Stephen's notebook.
- They're gonna want money

1031
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,070
so then we can get him back.

1032
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:36,948
Who's got him?

1033
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:40,452
Why, I think the Russians got him, Bloom.

1034
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:52,589
Stephen, God, please, what's happening?

1035
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:55,675
I don't know what to do, Stephen.

1036
01:32:02,099 --> 01:32:03,433
Shit!

1037
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:15,779
If you know what's happening, now would
be a really good time to speak up.

1038
01:32:25,081 --> 01:32:29,417
Oh, please. Please, not now.
I need your help here.

1039
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:31,670
I don't know what to do.

1040
01:32:58,197 --> 01:32:59,447
Thanks.

1041
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:19,759
I can't believe it.

1042
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:22,596
What, that Bang Bang fell for a car bomb?

1043
01:33:23,055 --> 01:33:24,598
Neither can l.

1044
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,183
Oh, you mean...

1045
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:30,478
You think maybe she faked it

1046
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:33,356
to make the Russians think she was dead?

1047
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:37,652
Bloom, what do we do now?

1048
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:46,161
It's a ransom note.

1049
01:33:46,245 --> 01:33:47,787
It says they have Stephen.

1050
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:51,458
It says they want the money
wired to a specific account.

1051
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:54,836
They give a bank to do it at,
a manager to ask for.

1052
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,881
Then an address to go to
at 2:00 p.m., in two hours.

1053
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,299
Okay.

1054
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:03,553
Well, I'll wire the money from my account,
and we'll go get Stephen.

1055
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:05,221
It's a lot.

1056
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,140
I'll do it. I want to. I've got...

1057
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:08,516
Well, how much are they asking for?

1058
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:10,393
$1 .75 million.

1059
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:12,270
Oh.

1060
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:18,401
Oh...

1061
01:34:27,244 --> 01:34:30,872
No! I'm gonna kill him.
I am gonna kill him if that's what this is.

1062
01:34:30,956 --> 01:34:33,249
If that's all that this
is, I will kill him.

1063
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,085
Kill who? What are you talking about?

1064
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:36,961
I will kill him. I will... No!

1065
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:38,713
What?

1066
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:46,429
I've been an idiot. This could all be a con
by my brother to get me to...

1067
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:51,601
Oh, God, he wanted me to end it,
and he gets your money.

1068
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:53,311
Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

1069
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:56,272
But would he do that? To you?

1070
01:34:58,150 --> 01:34:59,859
I don't know.

1071
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:03,655
Yes. Yeah, of course he would.

1072
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:06,783
To tell a story so well it becomes real.

1073
01:35:07,326 --> 01:35:10,036
The perfect con. That's his whole...

1074
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,248
God damn it, that's what.

1075
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:15,125
You know what? We don't know.

1076
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,461
- We better transfer the money.
- Son of a...

1077
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,547
It's your brother's life.

1078
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:24,050
I'm gonna wire the money.

1079
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:32,976
Okay.

1080
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,819
I'm coming in with you.

1081
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:44,738
No, stay here.

1082
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:49,576
Going in alone is a very
important thing to do.

1083
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:55,957
I'm so scared.

1084
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:03,006
Anything I can imagine
finding in there, I'm scared of.

1085
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:07,510
I'm gonna be here when you come out.

1086
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:54,224
Stephen?

1087
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:00,396
Game's up. Come on out.

1088
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:06,861
Come on, let's blow this one-hat town.

1089
01:37:42,773 --> 01:37:44,691
- Stephen!
- No, Bloom.

1090
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:51,072
Did Penelope wire the money?

1091
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:52,782
Yeah.

1092
01:37:57,663 --> 01:37:59,914
Stephen, tell me what this is.

1093
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:02,333
Jesus Christ, Bloom, I'm sorry.

1094
01:38:02,418 --> 01:38:05,086
I don't need sorry. I need the truth.

1095
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:10,091
God damn it, Stephen.
You tell me what to do.

1096
01:38:10,175 --> 01:38:11,885
- Get the hell out of here now!
- Tell me the truth.

1097
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:14,262
Is this a con or is it real?

1098
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:17,807
A con?

1099
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:21,519
It's real, Bloom.

1100
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:27,066
Hello, Bloom.

1101
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,068
God damn it, Bloom.
It's real, this is not a con.

1102
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:32,488
Are you happy to hear
from your old Diamond Dog?

1103
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:36,200
These are the Dog's men.
He's crossed us for revenge.

1104
01:38:36,493 --> 01:38:37,911
Damn it, Bloom, run!

1105
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:40,705
I told you Stephen would fall.

1106
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:45,001
And you? You are paralyzed,

1107
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:49,631
praying this is just
another one of Stephen's stories.

1108
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:51,633
Is it?

1109
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:55,345
Close your eyes now, sweet child.

1110
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:59,557
And I will tell you the truth.

1111
01:39:03,228 --> 01:39:04,312
No!

1112
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:17,659
Bloom!

1113
01:39:24,166 --> 01:39:25,917
He's got another gun!

1114
01:39:52,611 --> 01:39:54,862
Please tell me that's makeup.

1115
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:56,948
Please tell me that's a cackle-bladder,

1116
01:39:57,032 --> 01:39:58,574
and you just pulled off the perfect con.

1117
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,034
Please.

1118
01:40:26,645 --> 01:40:28,604
You said it, not me.

1119
01:40:32,317 --> 01:40:34,402
Can I get a "wow" for this?

1120
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:38,156
Wow.

1121
01:40:40,659 --> 01:40:43,119
You son of a bitch.

1122
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:55,923
You did it. You're done here.

1123
01:40:56,008 --> 01:41:00,344
I want you to promise me you'll never
come back to St. Petersburg again.

1124
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:10,646
Tastes like tinfoil.

1125
01:41:11,523 --> 01:41:15,109
All right, here's what I want you to do.
Bang Bang split?

1126
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:16,944
Yeah. Clean exit.

1127
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:18,071
How?

1128
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:19,572
Car bomb.

1129
01:41:19,656 --> 01:41:20,740
Good.

1130
01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:22,992
- Penelope?
- She's outside.

1131
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:24,660
All right, here's what.

1132
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:28,873
Take Penelope to Helsinki,
get that flight to Rio.

1133
01:41:28,957 --> 01:41:31,417
Play out the whole
"on the run from vengeful Russians" thing,

1134
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:34,045
that'll be fun for her.
Play it like I'm dead, actually.

1135
01:41:34,129 --> 01:41:36,214
That'll add some gravity to everything.

1136
01:41:36,298 --> 01:41:38,424
And I'll see you when I see you.

1137
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:42,136
- When?
- I don't know. Not too soon, I hope.

1138
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:44,889
Last thing you need is me hanging around.

1139
01:41:44,973 --> 01:41:47,642
Anyway, how am I going to top this?

1140
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:49,268
Bloom,

1141
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:52,105
pick a card.

1142
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:56,275
- All right.
- Got it?

1143
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:58,111
Yeah.

1144
01:42:05,869 --> 01:42:08,788
That's the best card trick I've ever seen.

1145
01:42:10,707 --> 01:42:13,084
Wish you had a bigger audience.

1146
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:16,254
You're the only audience I ever needed.

1147
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:29,016
I love you.

1148
01:42:32,062 --> 01:42:33,187
Bye.

1149
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:42,738
Shh. Shh. Shh.

1150
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:45,032
It's okay. It's okay.

1151
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:08,175
You know, he said this thing to me once.

1152
01:45:10,804 --> 01:45:13,055
He said to me,

1153
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:16,851
"There's no such thing
as an unwritten life.

1154
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:21,647
"Just a badly written one."

1155
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:29,030
Oh, God.

1156
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:34,035
I love you, Bloom.

1157
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:41,834
You know what we're gonna do?

1158
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:49,091
We're gonna live

1159
01:45:50,302 --> 01:45:53,763
like we're telling the best story
in the whole world.

1160
01:45:59,269 --> 01:46:01,020
Are you ready?

1161
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,824
And Stephen said
something else, once.

1162
01:46:14,993 --> 01:46:17,495
"The perfect con is one
where everyone involved

1163
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:20,081
"gets just the thing they wanted."

1164
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:28,464
Well...

1165
01:50:23,325 --> 01:50:25,451
You came to me.

1166
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:30,873
In the hospital ward
when I blew out my knee.

1167
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:36,503
But I wasn't there to
be cared for or carried.

1168
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:43,636
'Cause I was asleep.

1169
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:48,766
In my bed, in my house
at the end of our street.

1170
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:54,438
While you drove across town
at 3:00 in the morning.

1171
01:50:57,233 --> 01:51:00,819
It was fake.

1172
01:51:01,905 --> 01:51:05,074
For the sake.

1173
01:51:06,701 --> 01:51:10,245
Of making you take me for real.

1174
01:51:10,664 --> 01:51:17,336
But I guess you're even less impressed.

1175
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:27,930
If the world is a stage.

1176
01:51:28,473 --> 01:51:33,644
And we're all of us actors
in some cosmic play

1177
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:39,775
I am the man at the masquerade.

1178
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:45,114
Who was fake.

1179
01:51:46,616 --> 01:51:50,703
For the sake.

1180
01:51:51,621 --> 01:51:55,124
Of making you take me for real.

1181
01:51:55,625 --> 01:52:01,964
But I guess you're even less impressed

1182
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:08,721
I keep trying to paint a picture.

1183
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:13,267
'Cause what I drew.

1184
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:18,147
Could be improved

1185
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:21,775
if I could make you see.

1186
01:52:22,193 --> 01:52:27,489
More flame than flicker.

1187
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:31,326
These half-truths.

1188
01:52:33,288 --> 01:52:37,541
Could be improved.

1189
01:52:37,625 --> 01:52:41,837
With less of me.

1190
01:52:45,383 --> 01:52:48,343
And more you.

1191
01:52:53,808 --> 01:52:56,852
Believe what I speak.

1192
01:53:05,153 --> 01:53:09,156
At least just keep
