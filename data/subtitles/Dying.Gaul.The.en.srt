1
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,021
-Anything I can do for you?
-Be happy.

2
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:19,258
Three out of four of the last presidents
have been governors...

3
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:23,547
which is why I think we should target
the money there rather.... Just a second.

4
00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:26,297
Would you like me to take them?
You could have some time for yourself.

5
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:28,951
I can't think of anyone
I'd less like to spend time with.

6
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,095
-You sure?
-I'm positive. Thanks.

7
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:34,708
All right, well, be careful. Stick with Bella.

8
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,052
Bye.

9
00:01:36,158 --> 00:01:39,606
Sorry. Target the money there
rather than on congressional races.

10
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:40,694
Yes.

11
00:02:57,765 --> 00:02:59,456
Fatality.

12
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:18,048
Fatality.

13
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,439
Oh, my God.

14
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,414
Good morning.

15
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,160
Hey, I'm Olaf, Jeffrey's assistant.
Pleasure to meet you.

16
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:31,050
So, Robert, we are interested in your script.

17
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,620
-We're interested in The Dying Gaul.
-Okay.

18
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,197
So, that's that.

19
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,116
-Your agent is....
-Dead.

20
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,981
Yeah. Thanks.

21
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:50,286
Malcolm. Malcolm Cartonis.

22
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:54,631
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

23
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,135
Thank you.

24
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:00,267
-Who's taken over for him?
-Well, nobody.

25
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,858
Unfortunately,
he was kind of a one-man band.

26
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:04,810
Well, a good one obviously...

27
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:06,736
because I've read the script,
and Kohlberg's read it.

28
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:07,784
He has?

29
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:09,548
We don't green-light anything
without his approval.

30
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:10,665
Green-light?

31
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:12,745
No, I'm not saying we're making your script.

32
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:15,633
I'm saying we've all read it,
and we all think it's good.

33
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:16,876
And that's why I'm talking to you.

34
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:18,353
-Yes?
-Your wife.

35
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:19,530
Excuse me.

36
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:21,453
-Hey.
-Hi.

37
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:22,762
What's up?

38
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:25,167
Did we buy something
called Mortal Kombat?

39
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:26,413
Why? What is it?

40
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:28,905
It's this incredibly graphic,
violent video game...

41
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,657
with people's brains
blowing out of their head like tomato aspic.

42
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:34,000
Honey...

43
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:36,850
I've got somebody in the office.

44
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:41,099
-Oh, okay, sorry.
-Okay? We'll take care of it.

45
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:42,416
-Call me later.
-Okay.

46
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:44,307
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

47
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,188
So, where do you think you wanna go
with the script?

48
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:49,516
I'm sorry?

49
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,687
Where else do you wanna go
with the script?

50
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:57,872
Well, I thought I might take it
to some of the independents.

51
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,593
No, no. What a doll you are.

52
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:03,188
What kind of work do you wanna do on it?

53
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:06,261
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

54
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:08,237
That was just so sweet.

55
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,540
From acceptance to total rejection,
you took it all in stride.

56
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,709
What kinds of things
have you thought about or....

57
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:18,190
Well, it's as far as I could take it
without some kind of input from a director.

58
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:21,973
-And who's your dream director?
-Gus Van Sant, I guess...

59
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,796
-since Truffaut is dead.
-Good.

60
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:27,443
-Would you like me to show him the script?
-Yeah, sure. Why not?

61
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,262
That's good.
'Cause I already have and he likes it.

62
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:34,866
-I think I'm in the wrong office.
-He has some questions, as we all do.

63
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,326
And what's the title? Explain the title to me.

64
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,657
Well, you know, they go to that museum...

65
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,316
-Ken and Maurice.
-...in Rome...

66
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,208
-and they see the statue--
-Yeah.

67
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,478
But why is that the name of the movie?

68
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,068
-Hold on.
-Because--

69
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:51,317
Sorry.

70
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,935
Oh, I see.

71
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:57,850
I see. Because they feel that the sculpture...

72
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:00,916
in depicting the vanquished,
the dying soldier....

73
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:02,838
No, thank you.

74
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:04,915
-And the Gauls fought naked.
-Right.

75
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:07,574
-So, he's so young and defenseless...
-Beautiful.

76
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,913
...with just this little hole in his side.

77
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,177
And being that the statue
is by a Roman, by...

78
00:07:13,404 --> 00:07:14,484
Wow.

79
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:19,995
...by someone from the side
responsible for the slaughter.

80
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:23,323
And they identify with the Gaul,
because they're gay...

81
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,917
and so many of their friends are dying...

82
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,194
and they're looking for
some kind of response from the enemy.

83
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:28,789
-Right.
-And remember that part...

84
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:30,967
when Maurice says...

85
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,202
"Maybe some kind of compassion
was awakened in the Romans...

86
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,677
"by seeing the sculpture?

87
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:38,907
"And at some future time,
as a result, maybe some other--"

88
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,884
-Gaul.
-Yes.

89
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,156
Will be spared.

90
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:46,389
It's kind of oblique.

91
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:49,945
No, I understand.
And it has a political overtone.

92
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,904
-That's right. Which I imagine--
-No, no.

93
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:54,870
We're not afraid of that.
We're not afraid of anything.

94
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,950
The idea is to have the broadest appeal,
so that we can make money.

95
00:07:58,016 --> 00:07:59,358
But also...

96
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:04,993
so that to whatever degree
the movie affects people...

97
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:10,491
it can also be kind of a dying Gaul
for the viewers.

98
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:14,496
I mean, if you even look at a movie like...

99
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:17,339
well, say, just to pick something, Tootsie...

100
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,352
which we didn't make,
but which is a very good movie.

101
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,938
-Yeah. It's a great comedy.
-Yeah.

102
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:27,102
It says something,
in a small but totally amusing way.

103
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:29,921
You don't see it coming.
This guy is an arrogant...

104
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:32,026
you know, chauvinist.

105
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,417
He, for his own reasons,
feels he has to dress up as a woman...

106
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,915
and as a result he learns something
about what it means to be a man.

107
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:41,763
-And you feel good for him.
-Yeah.

108
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:44,797
So that's the kind of political statement
you can slip an audience...

109
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:47,203
without their feeling they've been had.

110
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:49,503
All right.

111
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:55,036
Well, The Dying Gaul isn't a comedy,
it's a weepy.

112
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:57,282
And these movies are very...

113
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:01,630
hard...

114
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:04,863
to sell.

115
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:09,664
They're very hard.

116
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,735
And they're my favorite kind of movie.

117
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:20,417
They just need to be made with care.

118
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:22,310
Okay? So...

119
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:25,664
I understand your reasons
for wanting the men to be men...

120
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,013
because of the political dimension...

121
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:29,088
-but Ken and Maurice--
-I'm not making them heterosexual.

122
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:31,812
-No, no. Please.
-I'm sorry.

123
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,626
I'm not asking you
to jettison any of your principles.

124
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:35,679
Sorry.

125
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:40,576
I think I know what kind
of person you are, Robert.

126
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,098
-Sorry.
-I mean, I read your script.

127
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:51,876
You hungry?

128
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:56,769
Early money is like yeast.

129
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,399
In other words.... Oh, wait, hold on.

130
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:00,835
Hello?

131
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,882
Oh, hi. Thanks for getting back to me.

132
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:05,444
Listen, do you have any video games
for an 8-year-old...

133
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:07,687
that don't involve human slaughter?

134
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:12,102
The Silence of the Lambs is another one
that touches on feminist ideology without....

135
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:15,369
-Did you like that movie?
-Yes and no.

136
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:17,540
-Did you make it?
-No.

137
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:22,595
-No, no. Why didn't you like it?
-The faggy portrayal of the killer.

138
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,256
-He's not gay. Jame Gumb is not gay.
-Yeah, that's what I heard...

139
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:27,715
but I think that's a bunch of bullshit
because he has the poodle.

140
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,219
I had a poodle.

141
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,881
My wife and I had a poodle.

142
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:35,595
Okay, but I bet you didn't wear nipple rings
and put on eyeliner.

143
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:38,533
And you probably didn't cut up women
because you wanted to be one.

144
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:41,509
-You never know.
-True.

145
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,759
Hey, you wanna meet Tim Burton?

146
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,615
It's just something's not working.

147
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:50,955
-Let me check.
-ls that a new battery?

148
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:51,973
I see.

149
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:58,662
What about Nick Cage?

150
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,070
I mean, he's losing his hair.
What's that about?

151
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:03,526
-So, do you want to sell this script?
-Sure.

152
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:06,545
-And do you wanna do the rewrites?
-What do you mean?

153
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:09,870
I mean, are you interested
in doing the rewrites or...

154
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:13,228
-No.
-...do you wanna sell the script outright?

155
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:17,927
No, I don't want somebody else
mucking around with my script.

156
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:20,199
Good.

157
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:23,784
-Oh, hey, did you talk to your dad?
-Don't ask.

158
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:26,609
-Why? What did he say?
-My father tells me...

159
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:29,774
if I dare set foot back in Egypt,
he will have me beheaded.

160
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:31,468
As in....

161
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:36,916
-Look. voila.
-Oh, hey. Yeah.

162
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,539
Sorry you don't have an agent.

163
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:40,972
But let's....

164
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:44,554
What....

165
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:48,685
Presumably, you are...

166
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:54,379
Iooking for something universal
in the experience of two gay men...

167
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:57,169
-which a broader audience will identify with.
-You could say that.

168
00:11:57,238 --> 00:11:58,896
Would that be a true statement?

169
00:12:00,662 --> 00:12:04,940
Now, don't say anything until.... Okay?

170
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:11,159
Most Americans...

171
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:14,001
Let's hold all my calls, please, Liz.

172
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:19,123
...hate gay people.

173
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:22,289
They hear it's about gay people,
they won't go.

174
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,702
What about Philadelphia?

175
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:26,289
Philadelphia is a movie about a man
who hates gay people...

176
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,408
and it's been done.

177
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,554
To get people into the movie theaters...

178
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,894
they have to think it's gonna be fun...

179
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:34,066
or sensational, or some kind of....

180
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,408
Make them feel fantastic about themselves.

181
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:38,416
No one goes to the movies...

182
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:41,716
to have a bad time or to learn anything.

183
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:45,012
-Do we agree with this?
-Yes.

184
00:12:45,786 --> 00:12:48,754
What is important
is what they leave the theater with.

185
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:52,820
And if they don't enter the theater...

186
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:55,572
they don't get a chance to leave it.

187
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:58,168
Is this acceptable to you as a thesis?

188
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:01,715
No?

189
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,602
No one is going to see The Dying Gaul.

190
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,478
If you could make it with Tom Cruise...

191
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:19,127
who wouldn't go near it for $100 million...

192
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:20,921
and get Spielberg to direct...

193
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,511
and release it on 400,000 screens...

194
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:25,687
no one is going to see...

195
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,281
The Dying Gaul.

196
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,372
Now...

197
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,272
if we make Maurice a woman with AlDS...

198
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:39,351
and, let's face it,
heterosexuals are getting AlDS...

199
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:42,457
-in disastrous numbers.... Robert.
-I want nothing to do with that.

200
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:50,560
We'll make our own version
of The Dying Gaul...

201
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:52,086
Ioosely based on your script.

202
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:53,143
Fine.

203
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:56,959
Or, or.... Wait. Robert!

204
00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:01,274
Fuck.

205
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:20,321
You didn't let me finish.

206
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:23,289
Or we'll give you $1 million for your script...

207
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:27,200
with which you can go out
and write 400 new screenplays...

208
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:29,373
about gay men with AlDS, without...

209
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:30,556
whatever's the most important to you.

210
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:33,050
-lf you want the script so much--
-We think it is good, Robert...

211
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:34,302
and we will pay you for it.

212
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,275
We will not make The Dying Gaul
with two men in bed...

213
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:41,146
falling in love, surviving pain,
and all the blah, blah, blah.

214
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:43,261
It's not gonna happen, ever.

215
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:45,661
Ever.

216
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:47,901
Ever!

217
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,792
Where you going, Robert?

218
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:09,669
You have virtually no idea
what $1 million would mean to me in my life.

219
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:12,448
I'm still paying off my college loans.

220
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:15,519
I've written 15 spec scripts
which no one will buy.

221
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:17,251
I'm paying child support.

222
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:22,758
And Malcolm, who just died, my agent,
was also my lover.

223
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,807
I'm sorry.

224
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:29,057
So, I can't, in good conscience,
take this money from you.

225
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:36,417
You are an amazing
and lovely person, Robert...

226
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:39,809
and you have succeeded
in making me feel like a total scumbag.

227
00:15:41,194 --> 00:15:42,601
Good. I'm glad.

228
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:45,601
-How's your health?
-I'm negative.

229
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:50,026
-Good.
-Maurice and l.... Malcolm.

230
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:53,579
God.

231
00:15:57,644 --> 00:16:00,874
-Can't I write you another script?
-We want The Dying Gaul...

232
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:03,624
and we want you to write it.

233
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:06,662
Take the million.

234
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:09,443
Write something else.

235
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:55,497
-Hello?
-Hi.

236
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:00,849
I knew you'd be up.

237
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:03,786
Hi.

238
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:11,372
I made $1 million.

239
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,323
-How?
-I sold a script. Isn't that incredible?

240
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,615
After all this time,
I wanted to call you and Mark first.

241
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:24,938
I'm gonna put a third of it aside
for his college fund.

242
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:28,301
Is he awake?

243
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:37,133
Well...

244
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,836
-I'm happy for you, Robert.
-Wait. Don't go yet, Kelli.

245
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,165
You ragged on me 17 ways
when I didn't come to Malcolm's memorial.

246
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:49,293
-I'm sorry.
-You know I don't have money.

247
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:54,163
-That isn't why you didn't come.
-Well.

248
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:58,547
Well, okay.

249
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,788
I'd really....

250
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:04,916
It would mean a lot to me
to share this with my son.

251
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,827
It's 2:00 in the morning, honey.

252
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:11,311
Okay.

253
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:15,379
Well, I'll call some other time.

254
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:21,743
Okay. Bye-bye.

255
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:23,414
I love you.

256
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:39,927
What?

257
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,642
We got it

258
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:45,497
Congratulations. May I read it?

259
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,013
Well, it's gonna change.

260
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:51,863
Before it does, may l?

261
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:54,327
-Please?
-Sure.

262
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,562
Hey. What's wrong?

263
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:00,735
Robert?

264
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:03,872
Tell me.

265
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:08,610
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

266
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:12,510
It's gonna be a beautiful movie.

267
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,977
And you are gonna write more movies.

268
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:19,040
And soon you're gonna be able
to write your own ticket.

269
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:20,894
I mean that, Robert.

270
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:24,711
Look at Spike Lee.
He writes movies he cares about...

271
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:29,093
about his own people,
and they make money.

272
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:31,466
I want that for you, Robert.

273
00:21:32,554 --> 00:21:33,765
Give me a hug.

274
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:36,258
Come on.

275
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,265
Okay?

276
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:47,074
You are very handsome.

277
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:52,069
And I'm getting a little turned on.

278
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:54,052
Are you?

279
00:21:56,588 --> 00:22:00,647
You can do anything you want,
as long as you don't call it what it is.

280
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:04,329
Understand?

281
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:07,693
Max, Debbon, I want you to meet someone.
Come on.

282
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:10,791
Hurry. Hurry.

283
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,430
What? Yes. That's why I'm not doing it.

284
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,023
Robert is a screenwriter
like Mommy used to be.

285
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:19,851
What a nice hat you have on.

286
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,855
She's going through a phase.

287
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:24,810
-Bath time.
-No!

288
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,399
-Did I ask your opinion? Go!
-No! No!

289
00:22:27,535 --> 00:22:28,615
Everyday!

290
00:22:28,687 --> 00:22:31,917
Hey, could you be louder?
Did you offer him something to drink?

291
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:33,318
Exactly.

292
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:36,458
-You have a child, Jeffrey says.
-Yeah. In New York.

293
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:40,424
-Do you miss it? Screenwriting?
-Oh, God, no.

294
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:44,265
I could only write the kinds of scripts
that Jeff would never make.

295
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,961
These agapanthus are beautiful.

296
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:48,203
-You know flowers?
-Elaine...

297
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:50,891
-offer him something.
-Can I offer you something to drink?

298
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:54,922
Well, I feel like I should say spring water,
but I'd really like a vodka.

299
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:59,120
-Peppered? Lemon? Ketel One?
-I'll drink them all and stay all night.

300
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:01,070
Just a plain.

301
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,112
But you should....

302
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,537
Some of these plants.

303
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,539
Okay. Yes. That's why I depend on you.

304
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:12,745
Some view, huh? Yes.

305
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,631
Okay.

306
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,643
There are days I wake up early....

307
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,211
Okay. God love you.

308
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:24,689
I'll look out and think,
"This is actually my home."

309
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,145
When is someone gonna march in here...

310
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:31,636
-and demand their keys back?
-Oh, God.

311
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:36,042
I wanna suck on you
till there isn't a drop left...

312
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:39,466
and lick you from head to toe
and have you inside....

313
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:41,361
Foreign markets and video.

314
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:43,983
You're gonna be able to have
a second house looking down on us.

315
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:46,443
Oh, everyone looks down on us.
That's nothing.

316
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,526
-Cheers, Robert.
-Thanks.

317
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:49,842
What does that mean?

318
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:55,604
-I'll make a call, then we'll go.
-Okay.

319
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:07,950
What part of town do you live in, Robert?

320
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:11,286
Oh, God,
I live in West Hollywood in a rental.

321
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:12,530
Not for long.

322
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:17,400
-I don't wanna change anything, for now.
-Oh, you will. You will.

323
00:24:17,465 --> 00:24:19,799
Elevator going up, up and up.

324
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:23,890
The context shifts. Things you thought
were luxuries become essential.

325
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,369
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

326
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:28,079
Suddenly your decisions are impelled...

327
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:32,049
by your desire
to own another Balthus, or Bacon.

328
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:34,130
This is the first money he's ever seen
in his life.

329
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:36,723
-He's not thinking about--
-No?

330
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:39,318
Decide for yourself.

331
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,448
Cheers.

332
00:24:48,828 --> 00:24:50,803
Hello? Yeah.

333
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:53,687
No, fuck him. Fuck him!

334
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:55,637
No, tell him I said it.

335
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,847
I'm perfect.... Okay, this is my message...

336
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:00,284
"Fuck you, Scott."

337
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:04,179
Fuck. If he asks why I'm angry,
tell him I said, "Fuck you."

338
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:06,708
Okay? No, I'll put it on vibrate.

339
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:08,210
-Jeff.
-All right, all right.

340
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:11,514
-I hate these test screenings.
-Why are you here, then?

341
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:15,859
I hear about a project for years, sometimes,
and I never meet the writers...

342
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:17,658
until we come to the mall.

343
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:20,596
I think they should spell it M-A-U-L.

344
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:23,261
Thanks, Danny.

345
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,406
I insisted on meeting you...

346
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,838
before I had to see you
completely crestfallen...

347
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:32,540
if your movie ever does get made.
Shaken, trembling, cast aside.

348
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,839
And Jeff made you sound like...

349
00:25:34,912 --> 00:25:37,149
there was a glint of a human being
in there...

350
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:40,151
so I had to see for myself.

351
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:41,369
Hi.

352
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,644
He's gay!

353
00:25:48,225 --> 00:25:49,719
Who's this mother fucker?

354
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:52,544
Keep your eyes on the road.

355
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:55,193
I can't stand it. Excuse me.

356
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:58,047
The road ahead of you instead.

357
00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:01,883
Okay.

358
00:26:01,954 --> 00:26:03,929
You suck on that, okay?

359
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:11,774
Robert, your script is so beautiful.

360
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:15,069
-Don't become one of them, all right?
-I won't.

361
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:33,631
-I'm sorry about your friend.
-So, what'd you guys think, huh?

362
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:36,702
-When did he die?
-January.

363
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,491
Of this year?

364
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:41,890
So, you're.... Oh, God.

365
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:44,093
Rough.

366
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:49,222
Sides of me, things I didn't even know
existed have sprung up and taken over.

367
00:26:49,383 --> 00:26:52,318
-Such as?
-I'm, like, famished for distraction.

368
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:55,036
-Such as?
-I don't know.

369
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:59,230
I can sit for days on end, literally, though,
surfing the lnternet.

370
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,207
Do you do those chat rooms?

371
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:06,567
-What? He doesn't have to answer.
-I don't mind.

372
00:27:06,632 --> 00:27:10,244
-I love them, actually.
-Here we go. Wish me luck.

373
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:16,607
They're like life after death, I think.

374
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:17,696
How so?

375
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,704
Well, there's no corporeal being.
There's just all these voices, you know?

376
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:23,527
Well, no, I haven't tried them, so....

377
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,835
Well...

378
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:28,862
you can make up anything
about yourself, right?

379
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,149
Right.

380
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:32,521
And do you know anything
about Buddhism?

381
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,825
A bit.

382
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:35,208
Buddhists believe in karma.

383
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:37,250
It's like the cumulative effect
of all our actions.

384
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,752
And that's what it's like...

385
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:42,689
just all this karma colliding
in the middle of nowhere.

386
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,419
What's your favorite really dirty chat room?

387
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,190
Well...

388
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,657
I like MenOnAParkBench, for one.

389
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:56,903
Park bench?

390
00:27:56,973 --> 00:27:58,085
Yes!

391
00:27:58,381 --> 00:27:59,657
To be continued.

392
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:00,870
Through the roof.

393
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:03,047
-Oh, that's great.
-lsn't that great?

394
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:04,579
Oh, I thought it was shit.

395
00:28:09,102 --> 00:28:11,590
-That is the nicest person.
-lsn't he?

396
00:28:11,854 --> 00:28:15,368
And the most fun I've had
with anybody in the industry in years.

397
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:16,387
Good.

398
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:19,496
-Hey, I'm in the industry.
-You are the industry.

399
00:28:21,007 --> 00:28:22,436
You coming to bed?

400
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:27,845
I think I'm gonna just, you know,
check on some things.

401
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:02,833
Hi. You've reached Robert Sandrich.
Leave a message.

402
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:09,192
Listen, I hope that wasn't too weird tonight.

403
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:14,730
She never goes to these things,
but she insisted on meeting you. So....

404
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,863
She's...

405
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:23,185
...incredibly smart and frustrated
and working on herself.

406
00:29:29,493 --> 00:29:32,013
Just being with you
got me dripping tonight.

407
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:35,179
So sweet dreams.

408
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,225
Thanks again
for putting up with all the hoopla.

409
00:30:20,794 --> 00:30:22,354
I don't think so.

410
00:30:32,987 --> 00:30:34,296
Yes.

411
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,809
-Hello.
-Okay.

412
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:39,768
Good luck.

413
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,843
Watch, watch!

414
00:31:50,913 --> 00:31:52,669
-You okay? Sorry.
-Excuse me.

415
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:02,587
Excuse me.

416
00:32:23,877 --> 00:32:27,674
Look who emerged. How are you?

417
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,723
-Shrimp with saffron?
-Hey, look who's here.

418
00:32:29,797 --> 00:32:30,812
Nothing. Thanks, anyway.

419
00:32:30,885 --> 00:32:33,122
-Oh, hey.
-You a vegetarian?

420
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,197
-You're not a Buddhist or something?
-Yes, he is.

421
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,994
-Well....
-Yes.

422
00:32:37,062 --> 00:32:38,971
-Here, that's got vegetables in it.
-Jeff.

423
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,972
-How's the revision going?
-It's going great.

424
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:44,094
-No?
-No.

425
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:45,312
-It's going great.
-It's not.

426
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:47,620
-Well, make him help.
-He's the one who wants you...

427
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:50,589
-to change your perfect script. Perfect.
-I've offered, believe me.

428
00:32:50,663 --> 00:32:54,558
Storm his office and demand
he spend the entire day and....

429
00:32:54,632 --> 00:32:55,974
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hey, Abe.

430
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,895
I need to find a great lawyer.

431
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,808
My 14-year-old
somehow managed to find a way...

432
00:33:00,872 --> 00:33:03,294
to hack into
the Defense Department database.

433
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,954
Why don't you spend
just an hour or so at my office?

434
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,065
-Okay.
-Really?

435
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:10,689
That was.... You all right?

436
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:13,281
You sure?

437
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:14,914
Robert?

438
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:18,471
-Hi. You thought I was avoiding you, right?
-A little.

439
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:20,515
Are you all right?

440
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:30,305
-You should pull that out.
-This? Why?

441
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:31,786
I've been meaning to tell you.

442
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:34,699
That right there is monkshood,
and over there.

443
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,608
The roots are dangerous.

444
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,690
-Really?
-Yes. Deadly.

445
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:40,520
I saw that. I saw that look.

446
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:45,251
You okay?

447
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:46,600
It was used...

448
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,108
to make spearhoods, spearheads,
and at executions...

449
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,155
-You sure you're all right?
-Yes.

450
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:54,823
...in primitive cultures.

451
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:57,795
It shuts down the entire
central nervous system completely.

452
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,811
You have to eat the roots, but still.

453
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:02,187
I don't think our children
will be eating roots.

454
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:05,734
-How do you know all this?
-Malcolm. He loved gardening.

455
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,896
I'm sorry.

456
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:14,888
He taught me stuff.

457
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:18,088
I think you should drink. Here.

458
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,817
Thank you.

459
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:30,314
I'm gonna stay up a bit.

460
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:34,255
-You wanna take a bath with me?
-I'm wired.

461
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:35,946
I need to pace, or something.

462
00:34:36,017 --> 00:34:39,083
-You all right?
-Too much coffee.

463
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:42,026
-Okay.
-I'll be in.

464
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:55,762
Go away.

465
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:01,623
Anyone here ever lost a friend or lover?

466
00:36:07,256 --> 00:36:08,271
I have.

467
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:14,580
It's only been a few weeks.

468
00:36:18,618 --> 00:36:19,829
It gets worse.

469
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:24,470
Do you ever think of killing yourself?

470
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:29,008
All the time. See a shrink.

471
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:32,856
Oh, God.

472
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:41,265
-Got any recommendations?
-Yes, Marta Foss in Santa Monica.

473
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,129
-She's great.
-Do you see her?

474
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:47,258
Used to, for eons. My boyfriend did too.

475
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:52,018
-How did he die?
-TB of the brain.

476
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:57,658
They drilled holes into his skull
and injected the meds right into his brain...

477
00:36:57,726 --> 00:37:01,141
an experiment that didn't work,
and put him through hell.

478
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:06,167
Did you help him die?

479
00:37:22,272 --> 00:37:23,319
Damn it.

480
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:32,824
Hello?

481
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:36,729
Yes.

482
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:41,883
I'm sorry.

483
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:49,121
-I've never told anyone.
-Wow. How come?

484
00:37:51,106 --> 00:37:52,186
Can't say.

485
00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:00,224
Oh, God.

486
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:05,436
My grief has me thinking
I'm losing my mind.

487
00:38:05,507 --> 00:38:07,777
-Is that natural?
-Yes.

488
00:38:08,548 --> 00:38:09,857
What does one do?

489
00:38:10,404 --> 00:38:13,306
Trawl these rooms
and sleep with all the wrong people.

490
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:17,724
Like me? You don't wanna fuck me?

491
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:21,661
I've already sort of got somebody.

492
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:23,996
Who?

493
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:27,359
-Oh, just some guy.
-Tell me.

494
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:30,465
-It isn't interesting.
-I'm interested.

495
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:42,593
Well, he's my boss on a project...

496
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:46,370
married, has two kids. I really like his wife.

497
00:39:02,313 --> 00:39:03,774
See? Told you.

498
00:39:08,361 --> 00:39:09,571
Sounds hot!

499
00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:18,241
Well, you know how to reach me
if you change your mind.

500
00:39:20,714 --> 00:39:23,104
Okay. See a shrink.

501
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:29,519
"Then, as Kabumpo
shook his head again"....

502
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:31,373
-Are you asleep?
-No.

503
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:40,201
Please, God, don't let me eat this child.

504
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:45,959
"Anxious.... Oh. Then as Kabumpo
shook his head again...

505
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:48,139
"the big boxer started off"....

506
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:51,055
Catch it. Catch it.

507
00:42:16,698 --> 00:42:17,713
I'm sorry.

508
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:22,517
Hey, hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

509
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:27,251
Baby. It's okay.

510
00:42:27,323 --> 00:42:29,712
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

511
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,839
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

512
00:42:35,772 --> 00:42:37,976
It's okay, baby. It's all right.

513
00:42:43,805 --> 00:42:46,139
Don't be. Don't be sorry.

514
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,860
-You are so beautiful.
-No, I'm not.

515
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:11,668
I'll be the judge of that, thank you.

516
00:43:13,984 --> 00:43:16,766
-You wouldn't like me if you really knew me.
-Yeah?

517
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,316
Would you care to elaborate?

518
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:24,736
-No.
-Good.

519
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,206
-Hello?
-Yeah, we got it all.

520
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:43,289
-What?
-Everything.

521
00:43:44,162 --> 00:43:48,352
There was this ant when I was meditating,
right after Malcolm's funeral.

522
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,550
It was a big red ant and it bit me.

523
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:54,748
And I couldn't kill it...

524
00:43:55,555 --> 00:43:57,857
because I thought, "What if that's him?"

525
00:43:57,923 --> 00:43:58,971
But...

526
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:00,987
now....

527
00:44:02,372 --> 00:44:05,187
And what about what I flush
down the drain without even meaning to?

528
00:44:05,252 --> 00:44:06,561
Spiders and...

529
00:44:07,972 --> 00:44:09,346
stomping on them...

530
00:44:11,493 --> 00:44:12,835
microbes.

531
00:44:17,893 --> 00:44:19,584
Everything I feel...

532
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:23,291
or touch, is a potential slaughter.

533
00:44:28,422 --> 00:44:30,080
You lived. He didn't.

534
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:36,227
That's all.

535
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:39,709
Are you seeing someone, Robert?

536
00:44:40,903 --> 00:44:42,430
What do you mean?

537
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,058
A shrink?

538
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:48,482
Oh, no, I did. But not now.

539
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,302
Why did you stop?

540
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:56,673
I didn't want....

541
00:44:58,281 --> 00:44:59,426
Thank you.

542
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,588
-I don't know.
-It's none of my business.

543
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:05,250
No, it's not that.

544
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:11,238
But are you?

545
00:45:13,738 --> 00:45:15,233
-No.
-What?

546
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:18,242
Seeing someone.

547
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,780
You gotta use this.

548
00:45:48,685 --> 00:45:50,889
You gotta promise to use this.

549
00:45:53,998 --> 00:45:56,551
It's too fucking wacky.

550
00:45:57,518 --> 00:46:00,006
Make something good of this. Promise me.

551
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,410
I promise.

552
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:06,344
Traitor.

553
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:10,086
What?

554
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,530
Hi, DG.

555
00:46:36,946 --> 00:46:37,960
Hi.

556
00:46:38,993 --> 00:46:42,310
-Can I sit beside you?
-Sure.

557
00:46:43,987 --> 00:46:46,027
Do you mind if we just talk?

558
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:48,171
No.

559
00:46:48,627 --> 00:46:50,667
-How are you feeling?
-Okay.

560
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:53,288
-You sure?
-Yeah.

561
00:46:54,035 --> 00:46:55,410
You seem sad.

562
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,864
Do I know you?

563
00:46:59,892 --> 00:47:00,907
Yes.

564
00:47:03,732 --> 00:47:06,154
Sorry, I don't remember our chatting.

565
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:11,793
Look at my name.

566
00:47:15,957 --> 00:47:17,451
You're an angel?

567
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:19,534
Yes.

568
00:47:20,726 --> 00:47:24,022
Does that mean you do nice things?
Is that what makes you an angel?

569
00:47:24,086 --> 00:47:25,646
That's part of it.

570
00:47:27,703 --> 00:47:29,361
Did you have a different name
when we talked?

571
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,379
Yes.

572
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,587
What was it?

573
00:47:34,071 --> 00:47:35,827
If I tell you, you'll go away.

574
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:44,375
Okay. So, did we have sex?

575
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,743
Yes.

576
00:47:45,816 --> 00:47:47,725
-More than once?
-Yes.

577
00:47:48,312 --> 00:47:50,167
-Really?
-Yes.

578
00:47:52,057 --> 00:47:53,748
Tell me what I like.

579
00:47:55,193 --> 00:47:59,252
You're extremely versatile.
You like kissing most of all.

580
00:47:59,386 --> 00:48:00,629
Am I right?

581
00:48:03,162 --> 00:48:04,339
Go on.

582
00:48:07,738 --> 00:48:10,356
You prefer it first thing in the morning...

583
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,409
but nights are also good.

584
00:48:14,202 --> 00:48:16,591
Was I drunk? Did I tell you all this?

585
00:48:17,915 --> 00:48:21,560
You like me to put a finger inside you
while I'm sucking you.

586
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:25,270
Tell me who this is.

587
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,252
No, I just wanted to say hi.

588
00:48:29,545 --> 00:48:30,952
-Wait.
-Okay.

589
00:48:46,794 --> 00:48:48,223
Did I date you?

590
00:48:48,747 --> 00:48:49,827
Yes.

591
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:52,134
Wow. Male or female?

592
00:48:52,427 --> 00:48:53,540
Male.

593
00:48:54,508 --> 00:48:56,963
That narrows the field, a bit.

594
00:48:57,547 --> 00:48:59,336
You've had your share.

595
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,464
How many men have I slept with?

596
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,810
A dozen or so. No, 18 to be exact.

597
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:22,693
-Who is this?
-Don't be afraid.

598
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,675
Dr. Foss?

599
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,452
She doesn't know
how many men you've slept with.

600
00:49:28,526 --> 00:49:29,541
Tony?

601
00:49:30,158 --> 00:49:33,225
-He doesn't even have a computer.
-How do you know that?

602
00:49:33,295 --> 00:49:35,335
From up here I can see a lot.

603
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:43,044
It's difficult getting through.
It's taken me a long time.

604
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,508
I want to know who the fuck this is.

605
00:49:45,968 --> 00:49:47,626
I love you, Robert.

606
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,528
I'll always love you.
Don't worry about selling the script.

607
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:52,746
Jeffrey?

608
00:49:53,328 --> 00:49:57,387
Jeffrey doesn't know what we did in bed.
He just wants to get fucked.

609
00:49:59,857 --> 00:50:01,864
Please tell me who this is.

610
00:50:02,161 --> 00:50:04,879
-You know who I am.
-Who?

611
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:09,447
I'm with you every night. When you close
your eyes, I curl up next to you.

612
00:50:10,162 --> 00:50:11,503
Say your name.

613
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:15,629
I know I couldn't stand that closeness,
being against you as we slept.

614
00:50:16,434 --> 00:50:17,579
Malcolm?

615
00:50:17,938 --> 00:50:20,491
I sleep with you and walk with you.

616
00:50:22,963 --> 00:50:26,127
Is this Malcolm? Stop this, whoever this is.

617
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:30,099
-Sweet dreams, baby.
-God, please don't leave.

618
00:50:30,804 --> 00:50:33,968
I'll never leave you.
I'm with you through eternity.

619
00:50:35,188 --> 00:50:36,333
Malcolm?

620
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:40,013
Malcolm?

621
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:43,406
Yes, baby, yes.
I'm right here. And you're safe.

622
00:50:45,973 --> 00:50:49,771
Write me tomorrow, little Bubber.
You're my little Bubber, okay?

623
00:50:50,293 --> 00:50:53,108
Sweet dreams, baby. I'm....

624
00:50:54,614 --> 00:50:55,792
Bye.

625
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,029
-Hello?
-Was that you?

626
00:51:18,104 --> 00:51:20,592
'Cause I swear to Christ, Jeff,
if that was you, I'll kill you.

627
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:23,152
-What are you talking about?
-I mean that.

628
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:26,288
Okay.

629
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:29,237
I am fucked up enough to do it.

630
00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:31,471
What's wrong, Robert?

631
00:51:34,874 --> 00:51:37,208
-You swear that wasn't you?
-What?

632
00:51:38,874 --> 00:51:39,889
Okay.

633
00:51:42,906 --> 00:51:44,467
What's the matter?

634
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:46,359
Okay. Okay.

635
00:51:46,522 --> 00:51:49,239
-I'm sorry. Goodnight.
-Hey, wait.

636
00:51:54,267 --> 00:51:55,249
E?

637
00:51:59,772 --> 00:52:00,786
Hey.

638
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:03,579
-Oh, sorry.
-Come to bed.

639
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:22,681
I wonder why Robert
never talks about his wife and son.

640
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:27,837
I wouldn't be able to stop thinking
about you if something happened to us.

641
00:52:30,271 --> 00:52:31,765
Do you think....

642
00:52:32,927 --> 00:52:35,578
Do you think it has something to do
with Malcolm?

643
00:52:35,647 --> 00:52:38,942
-Maybe.
-I just worry. So much to deal with.

644
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,189
-Dr. Foss?
-Robert.

645
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:54,012
What's wrong? Come in.

646
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,239
-Sorry to bother you.
-It's all right. Come, sit.

647
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:06,110
-I just have to ask you a question, that's all.
-All right.

648
00:53:09,698 --> 00:53:11,323
Are you ArckAngell?

649
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:14,689
I'm not sure....

650
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:16,859
Are you? Just say yes or no.

651
00:53:17,251 --> 00:53:20,699
-I don't know what you mean. ArckAngell?
-Are you ArckAngell?

652
00:53:21,123 --> 00:53:24,538
-'Cause if you are....
-Robert, have you taken something?

653
00:53:27,075 --> 00:53:30,938
-Never mind. I'm just really sorry.
-No. I haven't heard from you in months.

654
00:53:31,012 --> 00:53:33,402
Something is obviously distressing you.

655
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:37,371
Just forget all of this.
It was good to see you.

656
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,184
I'd like you to come and see me,
today, if possible.

657
00:53:41,253 --> 00:53:42,911
We'll see. Thank you.

658
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:47,651
I expect to hear from you, Robert.

659
00:53:47,878 --> 00:53:49,088
All right?

660
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:34,569
Hello. You got my e-mail?

661
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,187
Just now.

662
00:54:39,562 --> 00:54:42,377
-Do you remember the principles?
-Of course.

663
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:47,010
I can't stay long this time.

664
00:54:53,612 --> 00:54:55,783
I need assurances this is you.

665
00:54:59,276 --> 00:55:03,335
I taught you to dig bottoms.
You were once a bottom. My dog bottom.

666
00:55:03,596 --> 00:55:07,557
Then we found out I was positive
and I couldn't risk infecting you.

667
00:55:08,621 --> 00:55:09,831
What else?

668
00:55:14,253 --> 00:55:18,476
Remember the time right after I died,
you were meditating and there was an ant?

669
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:21,095
You remember the time I'm talking about?

670
00:55:26,254 --> 00:55:27,367
Maybe.

671
00:55:28,398 --> 00:55:30,853
It might be me, you thought, reborn.

672
00:55:31,247 --> 00:55:34,596
You thought if it was born
the instant I left my body....

673
00:55:34,671 --> 00:55:37,868
But life is like a current.
It flows through the ant...

674
00:55:37,936 --> 00:55:39,627
and you and me.

675
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,709
Indivisible.

676
00:55:41,968 --> 00:55:43,310
Look within.

677
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,513
More, I need more.

678
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:50,029
I fight to get through.

679
00:55:52,113 --> 00:55:54,218
What is it like where you are?

680
00:55:56,529 --> 00:55:57,675
Jeff!

681
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:00,303
Everything is wet now.

682
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,352
Hello?

683
00:56:05,426 --> 00:56:09,256
I can see from here
that you will survive and go on to flourish.

684
00:56:10,194 --> 00:56:11,918
-Hey.
-Hi.

685
00:56:13,715 --> 00:56:16,530
-Is Jeffrey there?
-Hold on a sec.

686
00:56:22,035 --> 00:56:23,562
Where did you go?

687
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:26,091
Jeff! Phone!

688
00:56:26,228 --> 00:56:29,130
-Can you take a message?
-I'm on the toilet!

689
00:56:36,564 --> 00:56:37,971
-Hello?
-Hi, it's me.

690
00:56:38,037 --> 00:56:40,939
Robert? Hello?

691
00:56:41,525 --> 00:56:43,892
-You all right?
-Yeah. I'm here....

692
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:46,379
I hear clicking.

693
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:49,259
I'm still here.

694
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:51,117
I'm typing up some....

695
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,717
I'm not Jeffrey.

696
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:57,744
You keep testing me.
I'm not Jeffrey. I'm not Foss.

697
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:01,107
You through?

698
00:57:01,879 --> 00:57:04,246
So, what was that about last night?

699
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:07,283
Jeffrey obviously isn't clever enough...

700
00:57:07,351 --> 00:57:11,126
to talk on the phone with you
and send you IMs at the same time.

701
00:57:12,056 --> 00:57:13,136
Just....

702
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:14,484
Just what?

703
00:57:14,552 --> 00:57:17,455
Sorry, I had some thoughts
about the script...

704
00:57:17,593 --> 00:57:19,895
-and I wondered if I could see you.
-Today?

705
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:22,928
-Well, yeah, that would....
-Are you still there?

706
00:57:24,857 --> 00:57:25,905
Yes.

707
00:57:25,978 --> 00:57:28,018
-That would....
-Yeah, today.

708
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:31,955
-You sound really distracted, my friend.
-I am. Let me call you back.

709
00:57:32,026 --> 00:57:34,098
Or what time could we....

710
00:57:34,169 --> 00:57:35,860
Why don't we meet at my office
around 3:00?

711
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,127
-Do you remember The Middle Way?
-When? I'm sorry.

712
00:57:39,194 --> 00:57:40,918
3:00. At my office.

713
00:57:40,987 --> 00:57:44,632
-Robert, I'm not Jeffrey.
-Wait.

714
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:48,055
Okay, that's great. Is Elaine there?

715
00:57:48,123 --> 00:57:49,716
I have to leave now.

716
00:57:49,787 --> 00:57:51,958
Elaine? She's in the bathroom.

717
00:57:52,156 --> 00:57:53,782
No, I'm all yours.

718
00:57:54,235 --> 00:57:55,664
Are you sure?

719
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,169
All mine what?

720
00:57:58,428 --> 00:57:59,802
Am I sure? Yes.

721
00:57:59,868 --> 00:58:02,105
-Are you sure you're all right?
-Now.

722
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:04,180
-Yes, sorry.
-Meaning?

723
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,313
Okay. Bye.

724
00:58:09,373 --> 00:58:10,682
Robert?

725
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,565
-Really, I am. I'll see you.
-I'm all yours now.

726
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,485
I'm sorry. Bye.

727
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:17,205
Okay.

728
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:20,092
I can only prove myself to you this one time.

729
00:58:20,894 --> 00:58:23,131
If you don't believe, I'm gone.

730
00:58:25,087 --> 00:58:26,134
Okay.

731
00:58:36,704 --> 00:58:39,551
I'll tell you something Jeffrey doesn't know.

732
00:58:45,696 --> 00:58:47,355
Kelli is my sister.

733
00:58:48,352 --> 00:58:50,491
You left her and Mark for me.

734
00:58:53,153 --> 00:58:55,870
I'll tell you something Foss doesn't know.

735
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:02,529
You've been drinking again...

736
00:59:02,594 --> 00:59:05,628
and you've stopped meditating
and going to the gym.

737
00:59:05,698 --> 00:59:08,480
-What you doing?
-Honey, I'm working.

738
00:59:08,547 --> 00:59:11,482
-Please don't distract me, okay?
-Sorry.

739
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:26,272
Here is something no one knows.

740
00:59:33,765 --> 00:59:35,194
You killed me.

741
00:59:38,085 --> 00:59:41,380
You stopped my heart
when I might have gone on living.

742
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,365
You couldn't stand to see me suffer.

743
00:59:43,429 --> 00:59:47,969
You stole potassium chloride from
the nurse's cart and injected it into my Iv.

744
00:59:53,063 --> 00:59:54,404
I can't stay.

745
01:00:03,784 --> 01:00:04,864
Wait!

746
01:00:14,472 --> 01:00:17,986
What's with the fucking phone calls?
Are you out of your mind, huh?

747
01:00:22,281 --> 01:00:24,518
-I thought somebody was fucking with me.
-Who?

748
01:00:24,585 --> 01:00:27,236
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-How come?

749
01:00:27,401 --> 01:00:29,507
Because it's resolved itself.

750
01:00:31,114 --> 01:00:33,056
And I can't know about it?

751
01:00:35,371 --> 01:00:37,575
You don't like secrets, do you?

752
01:00:37,706 --> 01:00:39,233
No, I just, l....

753
01:00:40,138 --> 01:00:41,633
I care about you.

754
01:00:42,827 --> 01:00:43,874
No.

755
01:00:44,523 --> 01:00:46,727
No. You just want a good script.

756
01:00:46,795 --> 01:00:49,129
Once we go into production,
you're gonna dump me like that.

757
01:00:49,196 --> 01:00:51,530
-ls that what you think?
-I don't know.

758
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,979
I can't tell anything about anything.

759
01:01:11,886 --> 01:01:14,821
Malcolm, if this is you...

760
01:01:16,846 --> 01:01:19,629
I know you think I've betrayed you,
sleeping with this man.

761
01:01:21,486 --> 01:01:23,047
I feel so lost.

762
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:25,705
I don't love him...

763
01:01:25,775 --> 01:01:28,808
or want to hurt his marriage.
His wife is about...

764
01:01:28,879 --> 01:01:32,076
the only kind, loving person I know.

765
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,102
I don't want to do anything to anger him...

766
01:01:37,423 --> 01:01:40,042
because he holds my future in his hands.

767
01:01:45,776 --> 01:01:48,526
I think he's just using me for sensation...

768
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,451
because his marriage has gotten routine.

769
01:01:55,346 --> 01:01:57,233
I don't think we'll last.

770
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:02,183
I need you to forgive me.

771
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:07,436
I'll end it as soon as I've finished the script.

772
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:10,091
I know you must...

773
01:02:11,347 --> 01:02:13,802
judge me for changing the screenplay.

774
01:02:16,115 --> 01:02:18,385
And I don't know how you feel...

775
01:02:19,379 --> 01:02:20,525
about...

776
01:02:23,188 --> 01:02:25,905
what happened our last day...

777
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:30,957
at the hospital.

778
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:34,229
You were in such pain...

779
01:02:34,325 --> 01:02:36,081
and the doctors said...

780
01:02:36,437 --> 01:02:38,380
that you would never recover.

781
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:43,027
That's what they were saying, isn't it?

782
01:02:44,374 --> 01:02:46,197
I'm afraid I've lost your love...

783
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:50,997
and your pain hurts me more
than mine could ever. Please, Malcolm....

784
01:02:51,862 --> 01:02:55,124
Please, God, let this be real,
let this really be you.

785
01:02:55,703 --> 01:02:58,354
I love you more than I love my own life.

786
01:02:58,455 --> 01:03:01,139
I want to be with you through eternity.

787
01:03:01,623 --> 01:03:02,703
Now.

788
01:03:02,968 --> 01:03:06,067
I can't bear this,
the pain of being without you.

789
01:03:06,136 --> 01:03:08,373
You are my body and my heart...

790
01:03:08,632 --> 01:03:11,948
and anything that is decent
and worthwhile in me.

791
01:03:12,057 --> 01:03:13,617
And you are gone.

792
01:03:14,073 --> 01:03:15,731
I want to be melded.

793
01:03:16,601 --> 01:03:19,056
If you tell me to kill myself, I will.

794
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,780
Please, tell me what to do. Oh, please.

795
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:35,763
Do you love Elaine?

796
01:03:37,242 --> 01:03:38,322
Yes.

797
01:03:40,123 --> 01:03:43,058
I did once, very much. I really did.

798
01:03:45,883 --> 01:03:47,061
And now?

799
01:03:47,772 --> 01:03:48,819
Yes.

800
01:03:50,171 --> 01:03:51,349
If, but....

801
01:03:52,988 --> 01:03:55,290
If I could have seen the future...

802
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,878
maybe....

803
01:04:00,925 --> 01:04:04,187
Sometimes I think, if it weren't
for Max and Debbon, you know....

804
01:04:07,165 --> 01:04:08,758
You'd divorce her?

805
01:04:09,085 --> 01:04:10,133
Yes.

806
01:04:11,037 --> 01:04:12,085
Or....

807
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:16,633
Did you ever see
Crimes and Misdemeanors?

808
01:04:18,526 --> 01:04:19,933
What? You'd kill her?

809
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:21,589
No.

810
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:26,686
-Stop--
-No. No, not really, not....

811
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,274
It's just a fantasy.

812
01:04:36,064 --> 01:04:38,235
What? You never fantasize?

813
01:04:39,424 --> 01:04:41,792
Mr. Moral, you never fantasize
about Malcolm?

814
01:04:41,857 --> 01:04:44,028
You never saw him suffering...

815
01:04:45,217 --> 01:04:48,992
and thought, "Christ,
I wish I could put him out of his misery?"

816
01:04:54,786 --> 01:04:57,404
No. I never wanted to see him die, ever.

817
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:02,873
-Okay, I'm a jerk.
-Ever.

818
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:32,092
Dearest Bubber...

819
01:05:32,773 --> 01:05:35,490
you did exactly as I hoped you would do...

820
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:38,973
and you have never done anything
short of the miraculous.

821
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:43,909
No one could have loved me as you did...

822
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:46,494
and you must go on living and writing.

823
01:05:47,302 --> 01:05:48,993
The movie is a good thing...

824
01:05:49,063 --> 01:05:51,452
and the money is, too,
if you use it for good.

825
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:55,196
I may not be able
to keep doing this for long.

826
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:59,298
I will watch over you,
and you will never put a foot wrong.

827
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:01,857
I will protect you. I promise.

828
01:06:02,952 --> 01:06:04,381
Trust yourself.

829
01:06:05,864 --> 01:06:10,337
Kelli will forgive you, and you and she
and Mark, will grow close again.

830
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,757
And you will have a long lifetime
of love and challenging work.

831
01:06:15,529 --> 01:06:17,417
You deserve these things.

832
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:22,177
I will try to reach you when I can...

833
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:24,679
but you must know
that I am always with you...

834
01:06:24,745 --> 01:06:27,615
always loving you, always saying yes.

835
01:06:28,906 --> 01:06:31,972
Yes, for all of eternity, Robert.

836
01:06:32,682 --> 01:06:36,512
And you must never doubt that,
never doubt my devotion to you...

837
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:38,308
and my gratitude.

838
01:06:39,851 --> 01:06:43,429
Don't press your luck
or Robert will grow tired...

839
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:47,074
and want to break your spirit
as much as the rest of us.

840
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:50,827
I will hear you always.

841
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,511
So please be good to yourself.

842
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,842
Remember, suffering is a disease...

843
01:06:57,036 --> 01:06:59,819
from which everyone may be truly cured.

844
01:07:00,365 --> 01:07:02,951
Look within: thou art Buddha.

845
01:07:05,966 --> 01:07:07,242
I love you.

846
01:07:10,862 --> 01:07:12,324
I love you, too.

847
01:07:13,966 --> 01:07:16,202
-You're so good.
-Oh, right.

848
01:07:16,271 --> 01:07:17,645
No, you are.

849
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:21,766
I think I see parts of you
that no one else does.

850
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:28,333
And you don't know
how much goodness there is in there...

851
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,466
just waiting to stir up a storm.

852
01:08:22,388 --> 01:08:24,559
It's time for you to start letting me go now.

853
01:08:24,629 --> 01:08:25,643
No.

854
01:08:25,716 --> 01:08:26,796
Yes, it is.

855
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:29,133
-Wait, what do I do?
-About?

856
01:08:30,037 --> 01:08:31,793
Everything. Jeffrey?

857
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:33,869
Your love is like a beacon.

858
01:08:34,261 --> 01:08:38,123
Anyone who crosses its path
will shine and be dazed.

859
01:08:38,934 --> 01:08:41,422
Let him play, but be careful.

860
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:43,791
Is he falling in love with me?

861
01:08:43,895 --> 01:08:46,993
Self-salvation is for any man
the immediate task.

862
01:08:47,671 --> 01:08:49,296
You don't like him.

863
01:08:49,622 --> 01:08:52,110
I will not pass judgment on this man.

864
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:55,501
I don't want to be responsible
for hurting anyone.

865
01:08:55,576 --> 01:08:57,398
It isn't in your nature.

866
01:08:58,263 --> 01:09:00,052
I want it to end gently.

867
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,637
You don't think he'd actually leave Elaine?

868
01:09:03,736 --> 01:09:06,103
Only he knows what's in his heart.

869
01:09:06,424 --> 01:09:08,312
What do you think, though?

870
01:09:08,824 --> 01:09:12,021
I suspect he said that
to make you feel better.

871
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:14,103
Look within.

872
01:09:14,489 --> 01:09:15,831
Sometimes...

873
01:09:16,537 --> 01:09:18,872
I don't know, it's almost like...

874
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:21,653
he enjoys making Elaine look ridiculous.

875
01:09:21,722 --> 01:09:25,999
Putting his dick in my hand
when she's in the house. Stuff like that.

876
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:30,930
And I don't want to wreck their marriage.

877
01:09:32,091 --> 01:09:33,465
You couldn't.

878
01:09:34,395 --> 01:09:35,856
You don't have that power.

879
01:09:36,731 --> 01:09:38,870
I can't believe he talked about killing her.

880
01:09:39,515 --> 01:09:41,971
You don't think he'd actually do it, do you?

881
01:09:46,076 --> 01:09:48,564
Anything special you want today,
Miss Tishop?

882
01:09:48,636 --> 01:09:50,840
-No, thank you.
-Okay, very well.

883
01:09:59,805 --> 01:10:01,179
Are you there?

884
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:10,261
Yes.

885
01:10:11,262 --> 01:10:13,150
He would, or you're there?

886
01:10:13,982 --> 01:10:17,147
Emad, I don't want you to clean today.
Come tomorrow.

887
01:10:17,983 --> 01:10:21,082
I need to concentrate on my work
and be alone.

888
01:10:21,151 --> 01:10:22,613
Okay, very well.

889
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:26,840
Okay....

890
01:10:32,544 --> 01:10:35,643
Only he knows what's in his heart.

891
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,056
He's so used to lying to get what he wants,
and he has...

892
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:47,481
so much money,
he could probably get away with it.

893
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:52,990
He seemed so guilty and ashamed
when he said it.

894
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:02,370
You will have many loves...

895
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:05,627
but I will have only one for all time.

896
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:08,448
Forgive.... Forgive yourself.

897
01:11:11,044 --> 01:11:12,353
I feel you.

898
01:11:13,188 --> 01:11:14,464
There's....

899
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:16,766
There's a disturbance.

900
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:30,371
Hi, you've reached Bella.

901
01:11:30,437 --> 01:11:33,733
I'm either on the phone or out of range.
Leave a message.

902
01:11:34,822 --> 01:11:37,026
Call me right away. It's urgent.

903
01:11:40,006 --> 01:11:41,053
Hello?

904
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:48,035
-Hey.
-Hey.

905
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:50,494
What?

906
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:52,028
We have to talk.

907
01:11:52,135 --> 01:11:53,117
Okay.

908
01:11:53,736 --> 01:11:55,361
Something.... Now?

909
01:11:56,072 --> 01:11:58,887
Robert's gonna come by to work in a bit,
15 minutes or so.

910
01:11:58,952 --> 01:12:00,927
I need a little time alone.

911
01:12:02,216 --> 01:12:04,321
-What's wrong?
-And then I need...

912
01:12:04,392 --> 01:12:07,076
-some time alone with you.
-Okay.

913
01:12:07,304 --> 01:12:09,443
Robert's not coming for the meeting.

914
01:12:09,513 --> 01:12:11,521
-He's not? He called?
-I know.

915
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:14,148
-You know?
-Please...

916
01:12:14,473 --> 01:12:17,091
don't insult me. It would be very bad
if you did anything now...

917
01:12:17,161 --> 01:12:21,668
to try to convince me
that it isn't or hasn't happened.

918
01:12:21,738 --> 01:12:24,160
-What has?
-Because then I would know you...

919
01:12:24,234 --> 01:12:26,241
to be a liar and I have...

920
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:30,949
concrete proof of what has taken place,
is continuing.

921
01:12:33,771 --> 01:12:35,080
I don't....

922
01:12:36,075 --> 01:12:39,556
Already you're fouling the water
of what could only...

923
01:12:39,628 --> 01:12:42,977
possibly be some kind of peace between us.

924
01:12:43,596 --> 01:12:44,676
But...

925
01:12:45,036 --> 01:12:47,109
you can't say another word...

926
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:50,570
or lie to me or I will leave you for good.

927
01:12:53,932 --> 01:12:55,176
Thank you.

928
01:12:56,461 --> 01:13:00,617
I need a little time to get over the fact
of what he showed me.... Facts.

929
01:13:01,229 --> 01:13:05,452
Don't make me elaborate
about this right now, please, Jeffrey.

930
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,037
All right.

931
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:12,169
I'm asking you
to give me some time here by myself...

932
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:15,654
and then the two of us
can sit down together...

933
01:13:15,727 --> 01:13:18,378
and work out
what we're going to have or not.

934
01:13:18,447 --> 01:13:22,124
Look, I promise,
I swear, I won't see him anymore.

935
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:26,596
I'll give the movie to somebody else.
I'll fire him.

936
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,074
-That would be a start, but--
-Can you tell me what he said?

937
01:13:32,144 --> 01:13:35,144
If you insist on grilling me,
then we can have it out now...

938
01:13:35,216 --> 01:13:38,250
but I can't guarantee
what conclusions I'll reach.

939
01:13:38,321 --> 01:13:39,597
All right, okay.

940
01:13:39,664 --> 01:13:43,462
Go away. Come back at 6:30.

941
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:46,832
I'll kill him.

942
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,159
I would never hurt you on purpose.

943
01:14:06,355 --> 01:14:08,559
Should I pick up the kids or....

944
01:14:11,828 --> 01:14:13,486
They're at Shoshi's.

945
01:14:14,612 --> 01:14:16,849
She's taking them for the night.

946
01:14:17,172 --> 01:14:18,514
You sure?

947
01:14:20,117 --> 01:14:21,742
I want to be alone with you.

948
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:28,372
I love you, E.

949
01:14:31,894 --> 01:14:33,869
That's all I'm going to say.

950
01:14:56,664 --> 01:14:58,901
-Hello?
-Oh, God. Where are you?

951
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:01,838
About eight minutes from home.
Did you call before?

952
01:15:01,913 --> 01:15:05,011
If you see Jeffrey, don't stop to talk to him.

953
01:15:05,272 --> 01:15:07,639
Turn off on a side street right now.

954
01:15:07,992 --> 01:15:10,229
Don't let him see you if you can help it.

955
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:13,713
But if he does for some reason, don't stop.

956
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,700
-Call me back, all right?
-Hello?

957
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:17,914
-Oh, I have to go.
-Jeffrey?

958
01:15:19,386 --> 01:15:21,012
Hello? Jeffrey?

959
01:15:24,282 --> 01:15:27,796
-The door was unlocked.
-He had to cancel your appointment.

960
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:33,401
He said he couldn't get back here
until 6:30, at the earliest.

961
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:34,837
Oh, well.

962
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:39,768
Excuse me.

963
01:15:50,492 --> 01:15:52,696
-Have him, Robert.
-What?

964
01:15:53,565 --> 01:15:56,697
Have him. Please. Take him.

965
01:15:57,533 --> 01:16:00,795
It will help my suit
if you're both more open about it.

966
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:07,289
Is there anything you want to say to me?

967
01:16:17,727 --> 01:16:21,371
Robert, what is unconditional love like?

968
01:16:22,112 --> 01:16:23,606
Can you tell me?

969
01:16:24,992 --> 01:16:26,421
How do you....

970
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:31,574
Where do you find it in yourself...

971
01:16:32,673 --> 01:16:35,837
to give, much less get?

972
01:16:36,641 --> 01:16:39,008
I'm not even thinking about that.
That would be...

973
01:16:39,073 --> 01:16:41,015
too terrible to contemplate.

974
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:43,743
Sit, please.

975
01:16:49,506 --> 01:16:51,099
You and Malcolm...

976
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:55,745
where did you find it in yourself?

977
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:06,400
How did you manage to put up with all the,
literally, the shit?

978
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:10,016
So much compromise.

979
01:17:13,092 --> 01:17:14,783
I never lied to him.

980
01:17:15,525 --> 01:17:17,347
Or accepted one from him.

981
01:17:17,412 --> 01:17:19,649
We simply said, "No more lies."

982
01:17:21,253 --> 01:17:24,482
If you had to venture a guess,
in order to help me...

983
01:17:25,093 --> 01:17:26,587
you would say...

984
01:17:27,654 --> 01:17:29,988
I failed to see. I did....

985
01:17:30,054 --> 01:17:32,421
I did what, from your perspective?

986
01:17:36,774 --> 01:17:38,269
I would say....

987
01:17:38,919 --> 01:17:40,512
I would say...

988
01:17:42,566 --> 01:17:46,658
that you are responsible for all of it.

989
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:51,780
All the things that make us feel like victims,
it's a lesson.

990
01:17:53,064 --> 01:17:55,585
Look within. No one is ever a victim.

991
01:17:58,568 --> 01:18:00,478
Look for what is positive.

992
01:18:03,144 --> 01:18:04,454
Well, good.

993
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:09,890
I'll look for the positive
in you fucking Jeffrey...

994
01:18:09,961 --> 01:18:13,158
behind my back over and over again.

995
01:18:13,226 --> 01:18:16,575
And all the while....
No, you will not walk out of here.

996
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:19,945
All the while,
I'm trying to be generous to you.

997
01:18:23,306 --> 01:18:25,194
Don't do me any favors.

998
01:18:25,803 --> 01:18:28,837
Self-salvation is for any man
the immediate task.

999
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,875
Please tell Jeffrey I'd stopped by.

1000
01:18:46,509 --> 01:18:48,134
ArckAngell is dead, Robert.

1001
01:18:53,102 --> 01:18:54,182
What?

1002
01:18:54,925 --> 01:18:56,354
He had to be...

1003
01:18:56,782 --> 01:18:58,309
deleted from his hard drive.

1004
01:18:58,382 --> 01:19:01,611
He doesn't even have a floppy anymore.

1005
01:19:02,862 --> 01:19:03,909
Nothing.

1006
01:19:06,318 --> 01:19:08,740
Self-salvation for all of us. Thanks.

1007
01:19:08,943 --> 01:19:10,022
How?

1008
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:15,909
The nice thing is, you will never know.

1009
01:19:16,687 --> 01:19:20,550
Thieves and hackers,
unlike screenwriters, feel no need...

1010
01:19:20,624 --> 01:19:23,275
to leave their name emblazoned
all over their work.

1011
01:22:18,848 --> 01:22:20,277
I'm very sorry.

1012
01:22:27,905 --> 01:22:28,985
Forgive me?

1013
01:22:48,771 --> 01:22:50,047
-Hey.
-Hello.

1014
01:22:55,907 --> 01:22:56,954
Hey.

1015
01:22:57,219 --> 01:22:59,423
Here's Pinky. Pinky.

1016
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:01,922
And your backpack.

1017
01:23:01,987 --> 01:23:05,337
You know what?
We're going to go visit Aunt Catherine.

1018
01:23:10,564 --> 01:23:13,215
Yay! Oh, let me drive.

1019
01:24:53,742 --> 01:24:55,303
Robert, open up.

1020
01:24:56,782 --> 01:24:58,538
Robert, I need to talk to you.

1021
01:24:58,798 --> 01:25:00,903
-Hang on.
-I've been calling you for hours.

1022
01:25:00,974 --> 01:25:03,876
-What the fuck, Robert!
-Jesus Christ! Hang on.

1023
01:25:04,431 --> 01:25:05,772
What did you say to her?

1024
01:25:05,839 --> 01:25:07,083
-Elaine?
-Yes, Elaine!

1025
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:09,868
-What did you show her?
-Nothing. Nothing.

1026
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:11,981
I don't believe you.

1027
01:25:12,047 --> 01:25:14,414
-I'm sorry.
-Tell me what you did.

1028
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:17,578
I just went over there for our meeting
and she was all riled up.

1029
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:19,470
Oh, yes, and you did nothing.
You said nothing.

1030
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:20,583
No!

1031
01:25:25,169 --> 01:25:26,827
Nothing to her at all?

1032
01:25:27,281 --> 01:25:29,452
I said she should speak to you.

1033
01:25:30,353 --> 01:25:31,662
I was sorry.

1034
01:25:32,017 --> 01:25:33,391
You're sorry?

1035
01:25:34,449 --> 01:25:35,693
You are....

1036
01:25:37,138 --> 01:25:38,545
You are sorry.

1037
01:25:42,994 --> 01:25:45,067
Do I seem
enshrouded in illusion to you, Robert?

1038
01:25:45,138 --> 01:25:47,724
Do I seem less real to you?

1039
01:25:49,586 --> 01:25:53,296
I'm sorry if I don't live up to your standards.
The trouble is, I'm bisexual.

1040
01:25:53,363 --> 01:25:55,633
I like both. You want the truth?

1041
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:59,656
But you're lucky to be only one thing.
I'm not. I'm not hiding in my marriage!

1042
01:25:59,732 --> 01:26:01,358
I need my marriage!

1043
01:26:04,436 --> 01:26:06,541
And not just for business reasons.

1044
01:26:06,612 --> 01:26:08,751
Jesus, half of Hollywood's
out of the fucking closet.

1045
01:26:08,821 --> 01:26:12,618
They're all on the covers of magazines,
proclaiming their pride.

1046
01:26:12,724 --> 01:26:14,699
Were you so....

1047
01:26:17,141 --> 01:26:19,563
I'm sorry I corrupted your poor little....

1048
01:26:19,638 --> 01:26:21,809
Give back the money
if it makes you feel so unhappy...

1049
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:23,601
you have to piss in other people's wells.

1050
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:27,085
I did not say anything to Elaine.

1051
01:26:27,158 --> 01:26:30,639
-She was very freaked out. She said...
-Yes, I got the note.

1052
01:26:31,607 --> 01:26:33,647
...that she had figured it out.

1053
01:26:35,031 --> 01:26:37,365
And I said that I was very sorry.

1054
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,530
You have no reason to tell me the truth.

1055
01:26:40,599 --> 01:26:42,454
I have no reason to lie.

1056
01:26:46,072 --> 01:26:50,131
You don't think
that she'd try to hurt herself?

1057
01:26:50,969 --> 01:26:52,398
Yeah. Any word?

1058
01:26:53,945 --> 01:26:55,472
No. What? Tell me.

1059
01:26:57,209 --> 01:26:58,550
Tell me now.

1060
01:26:59,513 --> 01:27:01,139
No, I'm not driving.

1061
01:27:04,698 --> 01:27:06,159
Are they alive?

1062
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:10,031
Tell me if they're alive.

1063
01:27:10,682 --> 01:27:12,405
Yes, Officer.

1064
01:27:12,826 --> 01:27:15,674
I would like to know
just the truth now, please.

1065
01:27:16,283 --> 01:27:19,250
No one survived the crash, sir.
They ran into a retaining....

1066
01:27:19,322 --> 01:27:21,046
The children are safe?

1067
01:27:22,235 --> 01:27:23,315
Sir.

1068
01:27:23,387 --> 01:27:25,656
A little boy and a little girl?
Max and Debbon?

1069
01:27:25,755 --> 01:27:28,090
There were two children in the vehicle.
Yes, sir.

1070
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:39,417
All of them?

1071
01:27:41,373 --> 01:27:43,347
We can send someone for you.

1072
01:27:43,421 --> 01:27:45,942
There is going to be
the matter of identification.

1073
01:27:46,781 --> 01:27:48,669
I'm sorry to have to have....

1074
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:51,547
Oh, God!

1075
01:28:07,551 --> 01:28:08,696
Help....

1076
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,007
She drove them into a wall.
