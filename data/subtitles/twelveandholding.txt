I'll give you that third birthmark
right on your ass.



Let's go!



I'll take that hockey mask
and shove it right up your butt.



You see him?



No.



Come on, Jacob.
It's cool.



Ow!



Oh, you got him.



Come on, come on.



What the hell is that?
Piss.



Hurry up. Go!



Oh, shit!



It's piss!



You and your ugly-ass brother
are so dead.



Anytime you're
ready, dickhead.



Stop throwing up!



You're dead!



I'm past the deadline
on my thesis, Lee.



I don't have time to debate you.
She's your daughter.



Ma!
I need help.



You know what, Lee?



Any parent would be
parent of the year...



next to you, selfish prick.



Yeah, well...



You're late.



Yeah, well,



I began menstruating
this morning,



and I had some difficulty
inserting the tampon.



What? It's a natural process.



You know I could conceive...



and carry and birth
a child right now?



Big deal. You won't.



But I could.



Do you think I should
have Mom look at it?



Our birthday
comes once a year,



and you ask for
a hockey mask.



You don't even play.



Jason from Friday
the 13th wears one.



He's bad-ass.



I dropped piss
on Kenny's head.



What?



Jeff and Kenny were here.



I dropped the piss
I've been saving...



on their heads.



Why were you saving piss?



Just in case.
Pretty smart, huh?



No. It's stupid.



'Cause now they're
gonna come back here...



and kick all of our asses.



You're such a butt munch!



You guys!



It's your birthday!



Try to get along.



Malee. Take this up, please.



Cheese.



Okay, you got
your small gifts this morning.



Now for the big ones.



Oh, my God!



Yes! This is too cool.



Do you like it, Jacob?
Thanks.



It's ten acres.
- I'm not selling that land.



I'm willing to pay top dollar.



All right, you know
what I'm gonna do?



I'm gonna write
down a number.



Look, our kids play
in those woods...



all the time.



You can't put a price on that.



I believe I can.



Go, man! Come on!



They're gonna...



tear down the tree
house tonight.



We gotta stop them.



So? It's just a tree house.



You suck.



Leonard, you in?



You don't have to go
if you don't want to.



I'll go.



Let him go.



Rudy?



Unless you're coming with me,
I don't wanna hear about it.



Jeff and Kenny pick
on you all the time,



and you don't do shit.



It's my problem.



No, it's my problem, too,
because we're brothers.



That's what brothers do.



I don't feel that way.



'Cause you're a pussy.



Rudy?



What?



Maybe we shouldn't talk.



Just listen for 'em.



And don't you fall asleep.



I'm wide awake.



Can you stop walking?



Wait up.
I've gotta get my lighter out.



All right, hurry up, man.



Come here.



We're gonna burn it down.
Here, come here.



Hell yeah, man.



Let's go.



Light mine, too.
- It's lit!



Move. You go first,
you go first.



All right.



Go.



You suck.
- Got it.



What?



You hear that?
Put it out!



Aw, shit, man!
They're in there!



Where are you going? !
- Go! Run!



Get back here!



Leonard! Aah!



Come on, wake up!



Come on!



Come on, you better get... Shit!



Oh, my God.



'Cause you're a pussy.



My baby!



Oh, my God!



Oh, my... my baby!



Jim, I, uh... I've gotta leave.



Again, I'm just...



I'm so, so sorry.



You still interested
in buying that land?



We can talk about it
later if you'd like.



Build houses,
condos, 7-Eleven,



I don't care.



I just don't wanna recognize it
ever again.



Okay.



This hospital is a nightmare.



How are you feeling?
- My head hurts.



You're lucky you
didn't get killed.



I told you I'm sorry.



I've never been
so scared in my life.



And... poor Rudy.



Was it a friend or family?



Huh?



The person who died.



Friend.



I'm sorry.



Well, you're...
you're gonna like Dr. Chung.



This is only my
second session.



She's really good.



I'm not a patient.
I'm her daughter.



Oh, yeah!



I can see the resemblance.



You trying to make me sick?



Miss Farland,
you can come in now.



Mr. Maitland?



I... I'll be just a second.



You're upset...



...and that's good.



And it's okay to
cry, you know?



Ma.



I know it's okay to cry, okay?



I don't need you to tell me
it's okay to cry.



If I wanna cry, I'll cry.



Fine.



You've gotta eat something.



Leonard has a condition.



It's called anosmia.



Oh, my God.
Is it serious?



No. Anosmia is when a person
loses their sense of smell.



It's not uncommon in patients...



who suffer severe
head injuries.



Unfortunately, it's
also affecting...



his ability to taste.



Again, not uncommon.



I-is it permanent?



That depends upon
the patient.



What... what do we do?



He can't eat.



Oh, he can eat.



He just can't taste
what he's eating.



I... I can't believe
this is happening.



Considering what Leonard...



could have suffered,
he's lucky.



And he is severely overweight.



Perhaps a loss of appetite
will be a benefit.



It feels gross, this
film on my tongue.



Hey.



I don't like apples.



So, you can't taste it, right?



Maybe you'll like the crunch.



Oh, my God.



That guy...



I... I. , like, know him.



He... he's one of
my mom's patients.



So?



Should we go over and say hi?



I just wanna get out of here.



You coming, Malee?



Tommy Camacho.



Jacob Carges.



Rudy Carges.



Rudy Carges.



He's not in class anymore.



Now, how do you know?



'Cause he's dead.



It is not funny
to joke like that...



about a fellow
classmate's death,



Mr. Carges.



Are you...
- His brother.



Was.



And I'm not kidding.
He's dead.



I'm so sorry.



Eight.



Ooh!



The state's requirement...



for upper body strength
is ten chin-ups.



Leonard, you're up.



Come on, son.



Come on, son!
Fight it.



Hey. That's enough.



All right, good job.



Who hasn't gone?



Did anyone practice
over the summer?



Great. Well, we still have
a fall recital coming up.



If anyone would like
to perform a solo,



the sign-up sheet
is on the door.



Class dismissed.



Not you, Leonard.



Center. That's the position
you'll be playing in two years.



Football?



You don't like football?
- I love it.



It's just...



I'll never make the
weight requirement.



Oh, there's no weight
requirement...



in high school, son.



These are your new bibles.



One on nutrition,
the other exercise.



Now, you do what they say,



and you can play for me
once you come to high school.



Thanks.



Coach, why are you
doing this for me?



Because I've never met a child
so out of shape in my life.



I'm being stupid?



No, they are wrong.
You call them back.



Ashley, I talked to the lawyer.
He wouldn't lie.



What's going on?



You know what?
This is all your fault.



Me?
- Yes.



Because if you'd
done what I said...



and gone to the trial,



this never would
have happened!



We both agreed it
would be too painful!



We both agreed!



You agreed!



Mom, what happened?
Tell him.



Tell your son.



The boys who killed Rudy
cut a deal.



They got a year in juvenile hall
and five years' probation.



One year.
That's what his life is wroth.



Ashley.
- One year.



Just calm down.



How can you be so
unaffected by this?



Your son was murdered!



It was an accident.



It was an accident.



And those boys
were juveniles.



So that makes it okay?



You're dead!



You don't believe me.
No, they're wrong!



It was an accident.



One.



That's what his life
is worth. One year.



Ashley, just...
Your son was murdered!



I can't believe
how much you suck.



I want them dead.



I wanna kill them.
I could handle a year in prison.



Don't you miss him?



You don't even care!



It's not that we don't care.



It's just...



Life goes on.



It does.



You have to deal with it.



You know 90% of people's
problems are...



due to their inability
to get over the past?



How do you know?



Mom tells that to
all her patients.



I've eavesdropped...



on some of her
therapy sessions.



That's cool.
Can I listen in sometime?



No.



Anyway, she says
if a person wants closure,



they gotta deal
with their problems head-on.



Go see these guys
and tell them how you feel.



Juvy hall's only
like 40 minutes from here.



Take a taxi.



I hate you!
You know that? !



Hmm?



All this happened
'cause of you.



You deformed retard!



Every night I lie in bed
and plan your murder.



I'm shaking.



I'm gonna take a kitchen knife
and chop off your fingers.



Then your nose,
and then your tongue.



Then I'm gonna take scissors
and cut off your ears.



When they find you, it'll be like...



putting a jigsaw
puzzle back together.



You kill me, you come here.



So? What do I have
to look forward to?



You destroyed my life!



What happened
was an accident!



There are no accidents.



You're gonna pay
for what you did.



And it's gonna hurt like hell.



Don't I know you?



You're Dr. Chung's daughter.



Yeah. You remember. Um...



We were never introduced.
My name's Malee.



Oh, hey.



Hi.



Gus. Hi.



What are you doing here?



I... I was in the mood
for a picnic, um...



And I thought this would be
a nice place to have one.



Move that fucking truck!



Right.
- Um...



Would you like to join me?
'Cause there's plenty of food.



Uh, you know what, I
don't go for lunch...



for another ten minutes, so...



I'll wait.



Meet me by that cement mixer
when... when you're ready.



So last time I saw you,



you were just getting
back from a funeral.



How are you doing?



Okay.



Death is, like, so
weird, you know?



I mean, it's sad...



...but I also feel
like I've been given this sign.



A sign which is telling
me life is short,



so you gotta do what
makes you happy.



You gotta take chances and...



get crazy!



And what are you
doing to get crazy?



I... I play the flute.



Well, you know,
that's... that's totally nuts.



The flute.



No, not like that.



Just, you know, like every year
my school has this recital.



Um, and, you
know, every year,



I've been, like, too
chicken to play a solo...



in front of people.



Um, but I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it this year.



You know what, good for you.



That's great.
Good for you.



When is it?



Why do you care?



Oh, 'cause I'm gonna come.



What?



Yeah.
- You can't go!



Sure I can.



Nobody goes to these things.



I don't even think
my mom's coming.



Well, you're gonna
need somebody...



to root for you, right?



And besides, I love music.



And, you know, I owe you
for this terrific lunch, right?



Are we having company?



It is all for you.



Your favorites.



Oh, and I made everything
extra spicy...



so you can taste it.



Mom, it doesn't matter
how spicy the food is.



So you're not
gonna even try it?



I'm sure it's delicious.



Forget it.



Don't eat.



You can't just eat
apples all the time.



Why not?



It's unhealthy.



But why now, though?
I mean, I...



I haven't fought fires
in over three years.



Something stirred
your unconscious.



If we can figure
out what that was,



we can get some answers.



Okay.



All right!



Let's do it!



You said that your
nightmares started...



around the time that
you moved here.



Yeah.



Let's explore that.



Why did you move here?



A friend of mine was
working construction.



He got a job offer...



over at the... the
Lindsay Acres job,



and, uh, I thought
it'd be a good idea...



to come work with him
for a little while.



Are there any
recurring elements...



to your dreams?



Faces?



Burnin' for You keeps playing.



Burnin' for you?



Yeah, you know,
the Blue Oyster Cult song?



Dad?
- Jacob.



Y-you okay?



Fantastic.



You know...



For the past few weeks,
I sat in this house...



I couldn't move.



Everything reminded
me of Rudy.



And then from
out of nowhere...



...I had a revelation.



I'm alive.



Your mother is alive.



And I became overcome...



...with joy, because I realized...



how lucky we are
to still have you.



Me?



Jacob.



I love you.



I went to work today
for the first time in weeks.



I was fearless.



It was as if I'd just
gotten out of college.



I went after accounts
I'd avoided for years...



because I thought
they were out of my league.



And I was amazing.



I was magic!



But then when I came home...



to share the news
with your mother,



I found her asleep,



and then when I
looked at the house,



I realized that her office,
for lack of a better word,



was also piled up,
so I took to the house.



I have made it my duty
to clean this place...



from top to bottom,



even if it takes me
all freakin' night.



Jacob.



Yeah?
- Will you join me?



Join me in this
symbolic gesture...



of cleaning out the old...



and bringing in the new.



Do I have to?



No.



Thank you.



A wonderfully
rousing rendition.



Our next soloist
is Malee Chung.



She will play the theme
from Love Story...



on the flute.



Thank you, Mr. Farmer.



Um, there's actually
been a change.



I'm not gonna play the theme
from Love Story.



Um, this is a s... s...



What?



I can't hear you!



Anyway, um, this is a song
from the Blue Oyster Cult.



One, two, three, four.



Can I see that?



Malee, you are always
surprising me.



That was great.



Malee.



Wow! Wow, wow, wow.



You... you were awesome.



Really?
- Yeah.



Be honest, because I'd rather
you told me I suck than lie.



No, no. You were...
you were great.



Hi, I'm Leonard Fisher.
It's nice to meet you.



Hey. Gus.
- Gus.



Excuse me.



Okay, okay, I'm leaving.
Nice to meet you.



We'll see you later.



Y-you really enjoyed it?
- Yeah, yeah.



It's a good song.
- Yeah.



What made you choose that?



My mother. She
was humming it...



all last week, you know,



'cause she's a big B.O.C. fan.



Right.
- Yeah.



Was she here?
- No. No, she's got class.



Hmm.
- Yeah.



Well, she missed out.



You're so sweet.



Malee, I, uh...
I had a really good time.



I... I gotta run, but, uh...
- Okay.



But thank you.
Really, thanks.



Bye, hon.



Leonard threw our candy
down the gutter.



What? !
- What?



You suck!
- Shut up.



Hey. Hayley.



Hey. Why'd you
throw their candy away?



It's crap.



I'm gonna ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.



Are you in a cult?



Grace.



This is exactly what happens
when kids join cults.



The first thing they change
is their diets.



I'm not in a cult.



The issue is that
you have stolen...



one of the most exciting
nights of the year...



from your sisters.



If anybody had done
this to you...



when you were a kid,



we never would've
heard the end of it.



Exactly.
- Now, get upstairs.



Now!



I wish somebody
had done it to me.



Maybe then I wouldn't be
such a fat pig.



What'd you say to him?



Just stop.



Why are you doing this?



To remind you.



How could we forget?



You've been coming
here for months...



to remind us.



No one's forcing
you to talk to me.



Anything to get out of my cell.



Is your cell small?



Yes.



So is a coffin.



Look, I'd do anything
to bring him back,



but I can't.



It's not easy being in here.



You saw Jeff.



Oh, what happened to him?



Pissed the wrong guy off.



Jeff's totally fucked right now.
- Good.



Look, don't come back
here ever again.



Free country.
I'll come if I want.



Don't expect me to show up!



Get off me, man!



I am not taking your
Halloween candy.



Come on.



If I wanna keep this
firm ass as an adult,



I gotta develop good
eating habits now.



And this is not good.
Not good for me.



All right, maybe just,
uh, the spider ring.



Okay.



All right.



So, work is good.



You know what, to
be honest with you,



I can't wait till
this job is finished.



Kind of creepy here, you know.



You know that a...
a boy died here?



Right before we
started this job?



Rudy. His name was Rudy.



Oh, you knew him?



Yeah. Um, he's one
of my best friends.



You remember that
funeral I went to?



Yeah. That was him, huh?



Some kids
threw a flaming cocktail at him.



Can you imagine
killing someone like that?



I mean, how evil can you get?



Gus?



Yes.



You okay?



Yeah.



Jeff Laskey is dead.



What?



He committed suicide
in his jail cell last night.



Carol Evey just
called to tell me.



Justice is served.



End of story.



What the hell do you want?



I'm sorry about Jeff.



Like you give a shit!



I bet when you heard,
you started dancing.



Hmm.



Ha!



Uhh!



I was watching that.
- Well, finish your homework.



So because you're an atheist,



I don't get to
celebrate the holidays?



Just because I don't
turn our home...



into a Jesus-themed
disco once a year...



does not mean I'm an atheist.



All I'm asking for is a tree, Ma.
Maybe a stocking.



How does nailing a
sock to the wall...



reconnect you with God?



I don't know.
- Hmm?



Forget it, Ma, okay?



An iPod? Sweet!



Do you like it?



I love it.



You guys went crazy this year.



May I be excused?



No.



I'm gonna take a shower.



No, we have one more present.



I thought we were gonna wait.



No, do it now!
Come on, do it now!



Your father and I
have seriously discussed...



...adopting for many
years now, so...



we decided to adopt a baby.



Hopefully a boy.



Don't worry. White male infants
are the hardest to come by.



60 Minutes did a
whole story on it.



Any adoption agency
worth its salt...



has at least a
three-year waiting list.



By the time your
parents get a kid,



you'll be in college.



You think they'll
want to start over...



with that baby shit?



No. It's just... It's like
they're trying to replace Rudy.



Doesn't matter, man,
'cause it's not gonna happen.



I'm thirsty.



Can you get us some drinks?



Why me?



'Cause it's the
gentlemanly thing to do.



I'll get drinks.
- I'll go with you.



Why are you guys...



all of a sudden
going to get drinks?



Because you've upset me,



and I don't wanna talk
to you right now.



Fine. I'll get the drinks.



I need you to hide
something for me.



What?



Promise you won't freak?
- I won't.



Holy shit!



You said you wouldn't freak!



That's a gun!



Wh-where did you get it?



I can't tell you.



I just need you to
hide it for a while.



Why can't you keep it?



My mother's a total snoop.



She goes through my stuff,
like, all the time.



Please, Jacob.



Somebody's life
might depend on it.



Here's the deal.



You know how my company
flies me to Florida every year?



Yeah. You and I go every year.
It's the guys' week off.



This year I'm taking the girls.



Just the girls.



You're staying home.



Why can't we all go?



I'm not staying here all alone.



Besides, like you said,
you've been going for years.



Give your sisters a chance.



Whatever.



I need money.



What for?



New clothes.



Nothing I have fits anymore.
- Your father and I aren't rich.



You can't get a new wardrobe
anytime you want.



What am I supposed to do?
Go to school naked?



Wear a belt.



I'll... give him some cash.
You can get some clothes.



No!



Grace.
- What? !



The X-men one's pretty sweet.



The last batch was awesome.



I gotta go.



Wait. Wait.



Parole board feels
I've been a model prisoner.



They're giving me
an early release.



How can they do that?
- I don't know.



They just did.



You're pissed, aren't you?



I knew you'd be.



What happened
was an accident, Jacob.



So, you're gettin' out.



Gonna head back to school?



Fuck school.



I'm going to New Mexico.



Live with my dad.



Works on a ranch out there.



You can't leave the state.
It violates your probation.



My dad won't tell anybody.



No one will even
notice I'm out there.



Your mom will.



Jacob, the entire time
I've been in here,



you're the only one
that came to see me.



She won't care.



Malee!



Wow. My God!



You look, uh...
- Different?



Beautiful.



You look beautiful.



Well, I bet you are...



driving the boys
at school crazy.



Boys my age are so immature,
you know?



I'm more attracted
to older gentlemen.



Well, you know, you
don't wanna date...



somebody older than you,



do you?



I mean, an age difference,
that can cause problems.



What kind of problems?



Well, I don't...
you know, problems.



You know, I think
when a couple...



has an age difference,



they, um... they end
up splitting up...



because they want
different things.



You mean sex?



Uh, no. No.



No.



Well, yeah, yeah.



Let's say, you know,
you're 12, right?



And a boy
just a few years older than ya,



well, you know,
he'll be more experienced,



and boys... they
can be impatient...



about that sort of thing.



Are you impatient?
- No.



But I was when I was a kid.



Yeah.



Why don't you have
a girlfriend?



Well, I did, but that didn't, uh...



That didn't work out so well.



How old was she?



About my age.



See that?



Age wasn't an
issue, you know?



You still wanted
different things.



I don't think it's about age.



I think when two
people really connect,



they connect for
other reasons.



And since soul
mates are eternal...



...they have no age.



Take care of your mom, huh?



Have fun.



Bye.



We're home.



Hi.
- Hi.



He's here.
Why don't you come out?



Jacob. This is Keith Gardner,



your new brother.



Keith, our son Jacob.



It's nice to meet you.



Help!



Leonard?



...pour it in slowly.
or all of this crust...



Leonard!



...wash away.
Just put it in nice and easy.



See, it's kind of thick already.



What's wrong?



It's on top of me!
I can't get up!



Mom, there's so much blood!



Leonard?
I'm bleeding!



Oh, Jesus!



Leonard? Leonard?



Leonard?
Leonard, where...



Leonard, where...
What are you doing?



What... Are you okay?



Leonard, what...
Don't shut the door.



Open the door.



Leonard...
Leonard, what are you doing?



Leonard? Leonard,
open the door.



You get top bunk.



No offense, but I never thought
my future brother would be...



...a brotha.



I never thought my
future brother...



would have a Kool-Aid stain
smeared across his face.



Fuck you!
It's a birthmark.



Leonard, what are you doing?
Open the door.



That's what this is about?



Food?



I'm trying to save
your life, Mom.



I don't need you
to save my life.



I need you to open
the fucking door!



I'm doing this
because I love you.



Because she's getting older
and she needs a father.



Call collect.



Ma, is that Dad?
Let me talk to him, okay?



That's not good enough.
You can't just...



He hung up.



What do you expect, Ma?



All you ever do is yell at him.



Oh, Malee.



You don't know
what you're talking about.



If you keep this up...



...I'll leave this place...



and go live with him.



Really? I would love to
hear his reaction...



to that proposal.



You're a bitch.



What did you just say?



Come here.
No, no!



Come here, sit down.
- Let go of me!



You wanna call him?
You wanna go live with him?



Look at me when
I'm talking to you!



Here! I'll dial the phone!
Okay?



What is wrong with you?



There is nothing
wrong with me!



You wanna go live with him?



Don't you realize that
if your father...



wanted you in his life,



the phone wouldn't be...



the only means of
communication?



I mean, wake up, Malee!
He's gone!



I gotta get out of there, man.



I can't live in that
house one more day.



I wanna come with you
to New Mexico.



No way.



You've never even
been out on of the road.



So?



You don't need me
to run away from home.



And you wanna go with me,
of all people.



That was an accident.



I can be helpful.



I can get everything
we need ready.



As soon as you're
released, we'll go.



Please, Kenny.



If this is what you want...



...all right.



Help!



Leonard!



Leonard!
Open the door now!



Unh!



Leonard!



Let me out of
here, God damn it!



Leo...



Leonard!



Damn it, let me out!



Leonard!



Oh, my God.



I smell gas.



Leonard.



Leonard!



Don't you smell the gas? !



Leonard!



Leonard! The gas!



The gas is on, Leonard!



Leonard, the gas...



Okay, okay.



Leonard!



Aah!



Leonard.



Leonard.
Leonard, wake up.



Leonard.



No!



Please!



Aah!



Please!



What the hell is this?



I made dinner, my love.



Right.



And I have a surprise.



You've been in here before,
haven't you?



Oh, Malee.



Malee, you gotta...
you gotta put on your clothes.



Don't you like my body?



Now, Malee.



It's okay.



I love you.



Malee. Stop.



Touch me.



Where are you going?



To call your mother.



But we're soul mates.



I... I don't even...
know what to say.



It's alive.



What happened?
- Gas leak.



My mom, is she...
- She'll be fine.



She broke her hip
and a few ribs.



We're trying to get your father
on the phone right now.



I have to see her.
- Shh.



You need your rest.



Everything is fine now.



Uh, you know, it's...



Before we begin, I
want to apologize...



You know what? It's my fault.



Uh, I knew she
had a crush on me.



I... I just felt bad
for her, you know?



She's a very lonely girl.



If it's any consolation, uh...



the whole thing
was kinda therapeutic for me.



Right.



Sorry.



I, uh...



It's okay.



It's your therapy, not mine.



Well, so, how was
it therapeutic?



I don't remember the last time
I slept so deep and so sound.



Don't remember dreaming.



Nothing.



Why do you think that is?



One of the last fires
I ever fought...



was a brownstone.



Whole families wiped out.



During the inspection,
I went upstairs.



And I found a little girl.



The whole right
side of her face...



was burned off.



But her eyes were open.



She was still alive.



Uh...



You know that the... the pain
must've been...



...excruciating.



You know?



She was... she was
begging for me...



to... to kill her.



And what did you do?



I did what she
wanted me to do.



I killed her.



I kept telling myself...



that that was the
right thing to do.



You know, it's... just...



But, uh...



I've never been so sure.



I'm sorry.



Gus, that's devastating.



What does all this have to do
with Malee?



When I saw her last night...



...she had the same
look on her face...



as that little girl.



She just wanted me
to take her pain away.



Doctor?



I heard it's supposed to rain,
so I packed a poncho.



You're acting weird, man.
You're not gonna be a chicken.



No.



I'm telling you, man,
it's gonna be great.



You ain't gonna be
a pussy, right?



No.



Wanna play some catch?



Where the hell did
you get that? !



Did I say you could touch this?
Did I? !



Okay, everything... and
I mean everything...



in this house is mine.



You got it?



You are not allowed
to touch a thing,



including this glove!



What's wrong now?



I was just looking at a picture...



of you and Rudy
when you were born.



God, I miss him.



But you have Keith now.



What the hell does that mean?



You have Keith.



Two boys again.
Everything's fine.



We didn't adopt Keith
to replace Rudy.



Didn't you?



No. Your father and I
discussed adoption for years.



Honey, we... we told you that.



Right.



Maybe if it was me that
died, you wouldn't...



need another kid to get over it.



What are you talking about?



I wouldn't wish that
on any of my children.



But one of us died.



And I bet if you could
choose which one,



you wish it was me.



You know what? I...



I know that you feel
we favored Rudy.



You did! Admit it.



I admit that he was
easier to raise,



but that doesn't
we loved him more.



Honey, Jacob, you were born...



with a different
set of challenges.



My birthmark?
- Yes.



And it's not easy
being different.



I'm not different!



You always made it seem...



like there was
something wrong!



There's nothing
wrong with me!



I know that...
- No, you don't!



It's like you don't know
what to do with me.



You never did.



Well, I'm sorry that
you feel that way.



You know,



you do what you
can as a parent...



and sometimes you don't
always make the right choices,



but you are my son
and I love you,



and I would do
anything for you.



I would fight for you,
I would kill for you,



I'd die for you!



Rudy used to say
the same thing.



And he was right.



And as un-Christian
as it sounds,



I still want the...



...boy that killed Rudy dead.



And someday, when
you grow up,



you'll understand that.



Someday.



A week?



No...



Dad. Dad, I can
take a train alone.



I understand.



You, too.



He really hates me.



He doesn't hate you.



I'm just gonna go see him.



That is not a good idea.



He doesn't wanna
see me. Fine.



I just want him to
look me in the eyes and say it.



I can handle it, Ma.
- You don't know him.



That's the problem.



Aren't you sick of being
angry at him all the time?



He hurt me.



But you have to
take me to see him.



You have to.



Okay.



You're late.



Put this on.



What the fuck is that?



You didn't bring a disguise?



No one gives a shit
what I'm up to.



Where are you going?



The main road's this way.



Yeah, but if we cut
through the construction site,



we'll hit the railroad
tracks faster.



Good point.



After you.



I'm sorry, Mom.



I just wanted to help you.



I spoke with your father.



He and the girls caught a flight.



They should be
here by morning.



Did you tell him
what happened?



I told him there was a gas leak.



I meant the...



I know what you meant.



I didn't tell him.



I don't think I will.



Are you mad?



You know...



Even if I could
manage the food...



...can you really see me
running a marathon?



You just have to run
to the end of the block.



It's not as hard as
you think it is.



Easy for you to say.



No.



It's not.



Okay.



I'll try.



Ow, ow, ow.



Son of a bitch!



I knew you'd chicken out.



Where'd you get that shit?



Is that real?



You killed him.



Come on, man.
Stop jo...
