1
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,096
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

2
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,937
It has been one week
since my last confession.

3
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,603
I took the Lord's name
in vain 211 times.

4
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,850
Goddamn it.

5
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,545
I had 22 impure thoughts.

6
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,386
- I contemplated murder.
- Murder?

7
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,725
Only in thought, Father.
Only in thought.

8
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,861
Get back here, you bastards.

9
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,337
Surely there must be some
self-abuse, my son.

10
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,243
I have committed
22 sins of the flesh.

11
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,482
You're a pervert.

12
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,417
You're not even making an appearance
in purgatory with that record.

13
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,318
Really? I had no idea.

14
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,449
I'm not even sure I have
the power to forgive you.

15
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,255
Please, Father.
I'll try harder.

16
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,796
Harder?
That's the problem.

17
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,526
You should talk to a priest,
not me, kid.

18
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,111
I can't believe
I actually told them...

19
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:34,118
that I'd abused myself
22 times in the last week.

20
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,784
Twenty-two times?

21
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,453
And I thought
I was going to hell.

22
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,192
Is it Grace or Gracie
for your grandmother?

23
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,763
Grace.

24
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,268
Come on!

25
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,503
Put out that cigarette.
You're breaking school rules.

26
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,875
Hey, Chester, I need to smoke.

27
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,450
It calms my nerves.

28
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,349
We're having confession
later today.

29
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,588
Thought you might like
to join us, Walker.

30
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,859
Gorilla.

31
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,861
Think there's a world record
for hanging?

32
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,025
Probably not.

33
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:24,092
Even if there isn't, I could announce
that I'm gonna set one.

34
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,109
Look, I can hang here all day.

35
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,810
Did you see that attempted catch?

36
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,285
Who would've guessed
she'd have such reach?

37
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,633
Thanks.

38
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,879
Get me Mr. Walker. Again.

39
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,889
You know, the green of your sweater
brings out the color of your eyes.

40
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,753
Makes them sparkle.

41
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,416
Really?

42
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,428
That's the sweetest thing
anybody ever said to me.

43
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,089
Ever?

44
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,070
Yes.

45
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,503
Father Fitzpatrick will see you now.

46
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,234
Thank you.

47
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,507
Good afternoon, Father.

48
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,080
How are you today?

49
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,341
Sit.

50
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,721
You were smoking
on school property.

51
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,620
Technically, yes...

52
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,750
but I was practically
off the grounds.

53
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,455
Technicalities are the cornerstone,
Mr. Walker.

54
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,396
Now there's too much documentation
on you already.

55
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,401
Are you purposefully trying to get
yourself kicked out of St. Magnus...

56
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,199
or is there another reason
I'm completely overlooking...

57
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,275
for your utter inability to fit in?

58
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,967
I'm destined for greatness.

59
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,704
You're 14 years old.

60
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,871
Greatness is not an option.

61
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,144
Now don't you think your grandparents
have enough to worry about?

62
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,812
A week of weeding
Father Zinger's gardens. That's all.

63
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,980
But, Father, I was only smoking.

64
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,320
Two weeks.
That will be all.

65
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,785
And one thing more.

66
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,460
Nothing gets by me,
Mr. Walker.

67
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,134
Absolutely nothing.

68
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,001
- Mr. Walker.
- Here's my late slip.

69
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,805
- You think so?
- Nietzsche does.

70
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,213
Independent seatwork
for the remainder of the period.

71
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,079
Have you read Nietzsche?

72
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,379
Is he that Chinese guy?

73
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,045
No, he's that philosopher guy.

74
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,952
Was he Catholic?

75
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,828
Seems odd not to be studying Catholics
in religion class.

76
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,160
Besides, I thought we were
having a test.

77
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,565
We're not. It's far too sunny out
for testing. Wouldn't you agree?

78
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,137
I'm hoping Nietzsche will be
better for your brain.

79
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,871
Well, I suppose so.

80
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,157
Sorry about your face.

81
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,594
What's wrong with my face?

82
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,162
Nothing.

83
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,959
I meant the cut from baseball.

84
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,530
In fact, it's a wonderful face.

85
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,504
Thanks.

86
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,673
It's about time
we went on a date, Collins.

87
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,605
Really, Walker?

88
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,440
Dinner, maybe.

89
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,573
Something formal,
but within bike-riding distance.

90
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,446
I want our first date
to be memorable.

91
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,850
And I want it to be
Good Friday every day.

92
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,717
Good! Next Friday night.

93
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,950
I'll come by around 7:00.
No, make that 7:30...

94
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,083
just to give you some extra time
to get ready.

95
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,433
Paging Dr. Edwards.
Please come to Admitting.

96
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,606
How's it going,
my Mr. Walker?

97
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,008
Mom, absolutely
couldn't be any better.

98
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,777
You?

99
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,440
Growing wings as we speak.

100
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,245
I figured as much.

101
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,287
Everything still working out
staying at Chester's house?

102
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,593
I like it there. Honest.

103
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,328
Do you go by the house?

104
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,197
Just to cut the grass.

105
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,694
Here you go, Emma.

106
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,272
Hello, Ralph.

107
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,633
Hey, Alice,
is that a new hair clip?

108
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,734
Don't mess with me, kid.

109
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,814
No, seriously.
It looks stunning.

110
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,991
Did you conquer the world today,
my Mr. Walker?

111
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,160
I've got a date with Claire
next Friday.

112
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,854
I like that girl.

113
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,995
Here.

114
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,265
I bought this for you.

115
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,216
I know, and I feel the same.

116
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,118
Not quite the haircut
I had in mind.

117
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,291
I think it's too short.

118
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,157
You could pull it off.

119
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,732
Not many could.

120
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,802
You make a fantastic scarf selector.

121
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,964
- Thank you, Ralph.
- You're welcome.

122
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,905
Your father would be proud.

123
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,728
Walker residence.

124
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,932
How may I direct your call?

125
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,407
Cut the crap, Ralph.
It's Chester.

126
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,604
Do you really think anyone's gonna believe
that's your grandmother?

127
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,646
Do you want to go swimming today?

128
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,513
I thought you hated swimming,
Chester.

129
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,177
My brother says you can see...

130
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,085
right inside the women's change room
from a certain angle.

131
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,317
I need to see naked girls.

132
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,725
I wish Fred had told me exactly
where you're supposed to look.

133
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,964
- Do you think he was lying?
- Couldn't have been.

134
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,708
This is useless.

135
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,801
I'm leaving.
You coming?

136
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,903
Christ, Chester.

137
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,482
No.

138
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,746
We haven't even dived yet.
I'm staying to work on my flips.

139
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,117
I've been reading
about Olympic divers.

140
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,690
Doesn't seem like there's
much competition in that field.

141
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,128
See ya.

142
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,122
Holy Christ.

143
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,189
Fred was right.

144
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,773
What's the matter with that boy?

145
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,908
Is he having a seizure?

146
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,282
Looks more like a fit
if you ask me.

147
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,826
With a seizure,
you're into the whole body...

148
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,727
including the brain.

149
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,164
However, with a fit... -

150
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,099
Fouling!

151
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,875
You're pulling the noose tighter,
Mr. Walker.

152
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,211
Old Testament depravity
has no place in this school.

153
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,807
I expected so much more...

154
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,046
especially from you.

155
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,248
Your father died a war hero.

156
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,793
But, Father, I can explain.
Honestly.

157
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,691
Obviously you've a deviant mind.

158
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,162
Now, mortal sins have been committed.

159
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,392
You will attend 6:00 a.m. mass daily...

160
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,695
to restore your spiritual purity...

161
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,567
and you will join the cross-country team
to deal with your...

162
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,230
energy surplus.

163
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,305
Now, Mr. Walker,
this will be your last warning.

164
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:36,040
Your next stop
will be public school...

165
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:40,050
where there is
no spiritual safety net.

166
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,779
Public school?

167
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,926
You're not joining
the cross-country team, are you?

168
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,937
Of course I'm not joining.

169
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,734
I was conscripted.

170
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,333
Why do you guys run?
I mean, what's the point?

171
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,742
It's in our blood.
We have to.

172
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,572
All right, gentlemen.

173
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,742
See you at Chorley Park.

174
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,945
All right. Let's go.

175
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,181
We run in cross-country, so...

176
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,191
run.

177
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,690
How in the name of Christ
did I ever end up here?

178
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,064
I ask myself that every day.

179
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,869
Did Father Fitzpatrick say the incident
would go on your permanent record?

180
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,670
He didn't mention it.

181
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,334
It probably won't then.

182
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,140
Do you think anyone knows
what happened at the pool?

183
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:51,222
Wanker! Wanker!
Wanker! Wanker!

184
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,119
I'd say so.

185
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,697
All right, gentlemen.

186
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,325
Silence!

187
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,040
Gentlemen...

188
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,041
I am deeply disappointed.

189
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,337
Shame on all of you!

190
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:16,813
This boy's father is dead,
and his mother is in the hospital.

191
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,352
Come on.

192
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:25,014
Leave him alone, Father.
Mr. Walker can stand up for himself.

193
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,724
We all need a little help
standing up, Father.

194
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,920
Leave him alone.

195
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,380
She had a rough time last night.

196
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,715
But don't worry.
We're watching her pretty closely.

197
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,375
Hi, Mom.

198
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,944
How are you feeling?

199
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,537
For a sick person,
I couldn't be any healthier.

200
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,207
Don't worry.

201
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,847
Give me a kiss, babe.

202
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,452
What's wrong?
Doom and gloom?

203
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,755
What was the most embarrassing thing
you ever did?

204
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,431
What happened?

205
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,437
I got caught committing
a venial sin in the pool.

206
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,270
It was an accident, obviously... -

207
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,279
a technical oversight
by the pool's manufacturers...

208
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,516
if you want to blame anyone.

209
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,920
Mom... -

210
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,424
Mom?

211
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,353
Mom?

212
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,930
Mom?

213
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,501
Alice, I need help!

214
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,504
Mom?

215
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,163
- Alice!
- What's wrong?

216
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,867
Out of the way.
Move, move, move, move.

217
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,944
She's breathing,
but something's happened.

218
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,775
- I'll check her pulse.
- We need oxygen stat!

219
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,678
Stand back.

220
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,799
- Hiya, Ralph.
- Hi, Mr. Karl.

221
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,502
How's your mom?

222
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,375
They say she'll be coming home
any day now.

223
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,813
Karl...

224
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,478
I know I was here last week...

225
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,078
but are you looking
to buy anything these days?

226
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,353
I'd feel better if your grandparents
came in themselves.

227
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,055
Here's a note from my grandmother.

228
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,132
But call if you want to.

229
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,201
They just don't get out
as much as they used to.

230
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,376
- Yes?
- Good evening, Mr. Collins.

231
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,438
I've come to pick up Claire.

232
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,640
You have? For what?

233
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,950
Our date.

234
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,814
What time would you
like her home by?

235
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,753
Why don't you just wait here
for a minute?

236
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,427
Claire?

237
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,326
Any of you kids have names?

238
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,593
I'm Ralph.

239
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,331
- Is it true about the pool?
- Yeah.

240
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,964
Because of you,
our swimming lessons were canceled.

241
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,635
Well, they didn't really
have to drain the pool.

242
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:43,010
After all, the chlorine
would've killed the... -

243
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,743
We need to talk.

244
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,511
Alone.

245
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,285
I didn't really think you'd show.

246
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,194
- I mean, after the... -
- The what?

247
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,798
- The pool.
- Oh, yeah.

248
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,638
Well... -

249
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,207
I'm sorry, 'cause I really can't
go on a date with you.

250
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,800
- Really?
- I'm becoming a nun.

251
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,540
Just because of the pool?
I mean, it was an accident.

252
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,446
- No, no, of course not.
- Good.

253
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,350
Listen, even if you are
becoming a nun...

254
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,391
I really don't think God would
hold one date against you.

255
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,050
He might.

256
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,328
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,334
Here, take these.

258
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,173
I got them because the whites
reminded me of the whites of your eyes.

259
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,477
Thanks.

260
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,087
Claire has clearly decided to put
the Great Wall of China defense on me.

261
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,486
I'm positive this whole nun thing...

262
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,559
is basically a way of denying
her true feelings.

263
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,692
- Understandably.
- What are you doing?

264
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,992
I'm trying to wake up my mom.

265
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,768
Sit down.

266
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,309
The doctors are saying...

267
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,779
it'll take a miracle
to wake her up.

268
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,347
A miracle?

269
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,886
I had no idea.

270
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,956
Well, she was already
pretty weak, Ralph.

271
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,094
Christ, Alice.

272
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,095
I'm sorry.

273
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,440
So, St. Francis,
who had grown up very rich...

274
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,669
left Assisi one last time... -

275
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,214
this time, decided to give away everything
he had, even the clothes off of his back.

276
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,546
Soon thereafter, he performed
the miracle of the stigmata.

277
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,812
Just like Christ, he bled.

278
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,478
Do you need to be a saint?

279
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,556
What? For what?

280
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,215
To produce a miracle.

281
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,127
No.

282
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,458
It's not a bad question though.

283
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,556
There are three considerations
necessary for that, Mr. Walker... -

284
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,101
faith, purity and prayer.

285
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,932
For faith...

286
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,063
you need to truly believe
in something...

287
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,472
that doesn't make
any logical sense.

288
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,807
For prayer, as you know, you need to be
in direct communication with God.

289
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:32,181
And for purity, you need to be
completely free from sin.

290
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,650
So anyone could perform
a miracle?

291
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,650
Technically, yes.

292
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,986
A word with you,
Father Hibbert, if I may.

293
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,695
Certainly, Father.
Excuse me for a minute, gentlemen.

294
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,526
Father?

295
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,797
Were you aware
that Nietzsche was a communist?

296
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,235
I can assure you, Father,
your sources are wrong.

297
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,809
Who are you reading?

298
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,276
Stick to the catechism, Father.

299
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,315
Nietzsche has no place
in a ninth-grade religion class...

300
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,509
nor any religion class
in my school.

301
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:10,349
These students won't survive
unless they follow the rules.

302
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,417
Nietzsche wrote that.

303
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,219
I think there's
some truth to it, Father.

304
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,662
Don't push it, Father Hibbert.

305
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,300
Yes, Father.

306
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,385
Father Hibbert?

307
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,355
What is it, Mr. Walker?

308
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,984
Producing a miracle is possible?

309
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,094
Flying to the moon is possible,
but it's never gonna happen.

310
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,289
I can see what you mean.

311
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,925
Hills on the way over
were pretty brutal.

312
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,222
The workout hasn't started yet.

313
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,796
That's the hill.

314
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,598
All right, gentlemen,
let's get started.

315
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,140
Only 180 training days left
until the Boston Marathon.

316
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,937
Father...

317
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,274
about the Boston Marathon...

318
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,279
does everyone from the team
get to go?

319
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,812
Do we really have a chance
of winning?

320
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,384
What?

321
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,252
You mentioned that there was 180 days left
until the Boston Marathon...

322
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,792
and I was wondering if we were all going
because I'd really like to see Boston.

323
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,987
- Will we be fund-raising to pay for it?
- I was kidding.

324
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,999
Boston is one of the world's
most prestigious footraces.

325
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,125
Anyone on this team winning
the Boston Marathon...

326
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,602
would be a miracle to rival
the loaves and fishes.

327
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,708
A miracle?

328
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,970
All right, gentlemen,
on your marks.

329
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,137
Okay then.

330
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,942
Let's run some hills!

331
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,910
- What's wrong with that kid?
- Who knows.

332
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,287
But I hear they're gonna put him into
an orphanage when his mother dies.

333
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,095
Hey, you gettin' a boner
from these ropes, Chester?

334
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,172
- No.
- Me neither.

335
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,972
I was thinking about running
the Boston Marathon.

336
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,874
But you told me
you hated cross-country.

337
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,312
Besides, what makes you think
you can actually run a marathon?

338
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,182
Leave some room
for the Holy Spirit, Mr. Walker.

339
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,817
Ralph. Ralph.

340
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,126
Run Boston, Ralph.

341
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,560
Run Boston,
and it'll be a miracle.

342
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,299
Are you okay?

343
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,341
I was having a moment with God.

344
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,809
He was giving me some instructions.

345
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,910
Mr. Jones, take Mr. Walker
to the nurse's office, please.

346
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:37,090
Mr. Walker,
an unsolicited visit for once.

347
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:40,255
I heard about your head injury
from Father Gregg.

348
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,890
We must be vigilant
about temptation.

349
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,628
Father...

350
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,363
I just wanted to ask you a question...

351
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,837
since you're the closest one to God
I know around here.

352
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,603
You have my undivided attention.

353
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,941
Father Hibbert told us
that it would take a miracle...

354
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,106
for anyone from the cross-country team
to win the Boston Marathon.

355
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,548
Father Hibbert
would probably know.

356
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,579
Well, my mom needs a miracle
to get out of her coma.

357
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,678
And?

358
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,453
Me winning the Boston Marathon
could be that miracle.

359
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,028
God told me.

360
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,031
God told you?

361
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,295
Today at gym,
when I fell off the ropes.

362
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,370
Did he tell you how to do it?

363
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,496
No. That's why I need your help...

364
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,074
especially with the purity part...

365
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,268
and prayer probably.

366
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:30,314
I believe that what you're talking about
could be bordering on blasphemy...

367
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,440
even if it is unintentional...

368
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,108
so let's be careful.

369
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,914
God did not ask you...

370
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,387
to win Boston
to get your mother out of a coma.

371
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,957
It doesn't work like that.

372
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,653
- How does it work?
- Why would he ask you?

373
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,855
Well, I don't know.

374
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,431
He just did.

375
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,262
Precisely. You don't know.

376
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,199
It wasn't God.

377
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,861
It was the bump on your head... -

378
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,667
a hallucination at best.

379
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,106
Father, I don't mean
to be disrespectful, but... -

380
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:02,305
Mr. Walker, trust me. You are not
going to perform any miracles.

381
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,309
You're not running Boston.

382
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,282
Is that clear?

383
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,012
Yes, Father.

384
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,220
Father, forgive me,
for I have lied...

385
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,191
to a priest.

386
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,076
How far have we run, Father?

387
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,544
- One mile.
- That's it?

388
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,013
- Turn back if you want to.
- I can't.

389
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,018
All right, stop.

390
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,083
I heard you talked
to Father Fitzpatrick.

391
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,659
Yes, Father.

392
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,456
Let's get something straight
right here and now, all right?

393
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,656
So there's absolutely no confusion.

394
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,562
Forget about miracles, please.

395
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,301
I would've thought you
of all people... - a priest... -

396
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,167
would believe in miracles.

397
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,172
I'm trying to help you, Ralph.

398
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:07,005
Father Fitzpatrick is upper clergy,
monsignor material.

399
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,875
Not a man you want
to go up against.

400
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,881
Your friend Nietzsche wrote,
and I quote...

401
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,651
I'm trying to be both.

402
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,558
That's not what Nietzsche meant.

403
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,388
I don't care.

404
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,726
Okay, so the cosmic events
stacked up...

405
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:30,062
and I was still unsure about it
until my conversation with God.

406
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:33,535
Unfortunately, you'll still be in a coma
for a few months...

407
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,663
because Boston's not until April...

408
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,038
but that's better
than the rest of your life.

409
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,874
Excuse me for a second, Mom.

410
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,647
Claire.

411
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,550
What's wrong with your grandmother?

412
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,085
She's not my grandmother.
This is Mrs. Scarlet.

413
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,213
She's a patient here.
I volunteer at the hospital.

414
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:55,292
Mrs. Scarlet,
Ralph Walker.

415
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,985
Hello.

416
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,562
Can I talk to you for a second?

417
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,063
I need some advice on religion...

418
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,693
specifically stuff
of a miraculous nature.

419
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,931
Miracles? Why?

420
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,667
So tell me again.
What did God look like?

421
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,269
- Santa Claus.
- Really?

422
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,110
I've been praying since I was five
for a divine tap on the shoulder.

423
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,117
I envy you.

424
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,153
So what's your question?

425
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,753
I just want to make sure
I'm not missing anything.

426
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,325
I do those three things...

427
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,724
and all I have to do
is show up for Boston and I'll win?

428
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,026
Wrong. That's where
the faith part comes in.

429
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,965
You have to believe
that you're gonna win Boston.

430
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,832
I do. God told me.

431
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,463
Do you believe it
right down to your bones?

432
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,142
Just as I suspected.

433
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,475
You see, God won't be in your corner
unless you believe you're gonna win.

434
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,641
There's no way I'll be able
to improve that much.

435
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,378
Well, if you feel that way, Ralph,
of course you won't win.

436
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:58,182
It's obvious you don't have faith,
and you're done before you started.

437
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,984
Don't you see?

438
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:03,185
Good point, Collins.
You got me there.

439
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,626
- You'll be in my prayers every night.
- I will?

440
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,558
If I can in any way help
with a miracle...

441
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,465
I might be able to skip purgatory
altogether.

442
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,409
Chester, pedal harder.

443
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,885
Isn't the idea you run faster?

444
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,547
Listen, I'm doing the best I can...

445
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,921
but I've gotta train my legs
to accept speed...

446
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,653
so give it all you've got.

447
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,669
You're slowing down.
Come on, Ralph!

448
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,900
Chester, stop!

449
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,301
Goddamn it!

450
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,206
Oh, shit.

451
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:05,479
Sorry. Are you all right?

452
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,826
Yeah.

453
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,325
I don't mean to sound like a know-it-all,
but what are you doing?

454
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,335
There's no way you're gonna finish Boston.
Never mind winning it.

455
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,598
On top of that,
there's the Fitz factor.

456
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,004
Fitz doesn't scare me...

457
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,077
not if I can train harder
than anyone's ever trained before...

458
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:30,079
even if it means
being dragged behind a bike.

459
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,844
After that,
the miracle is in God's hands.

460
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,783
Don't you see?

461
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,522
Get on the bike.

462
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,129
This is from your garden.

463
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,430
Sorry about this.

464
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,566
I picked it up from Baxter
this morning.

465
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,304
Mrs. Kopolous doesn't want me
to have her dog's business.

466
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,513
When you get out of your coma,
I'm sure you'll hear all about it.

467
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,082
What are you doing?

468
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,353
Nothing.

469
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,825
I read that smell
is the strongest memory.

470
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,330
So you're making your mom
smell that?

471
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,899
Yeah.

472
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,901
Well, I started with
my dad's old sweater.

473
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,972
But that didn't work,
so I moved on.

474
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,775
- What's this?
- I thought it might help with the miracle... -

475
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,072
you know, reading about Catholics
who got it right.

476
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,806
Thanks.

477
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:40,145
It was an Easter present
from Sister Bernadette last year.

478
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,809
It's been blessed.

479
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,420
I could use that.

480
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,430
I'm trying to be pure.

481
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,194
I'm trying to apply some of the martyrs'
pain techniques to running.

482
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,166
Martyrs were marathoners?

483
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,205
No. Endurance athletes of a sort.

484
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,968
Plus there's stuff
on purity and prayer as well...

485
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,306
which will come in handy
for the miracle.

486
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,941
How could you fail a Latin test?

487
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,811
I don't have the gift of tongues.

488
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,656
Please sign it.

489
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,984
You'd never tell them it was me,
would you?

490
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,424
Oh, my.

491
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,459
Are you all right,
Mr. Walker?

492
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,529
Fine, Father.

493
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,722
Thanks.

494
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,959
What's this for?

495
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,625
I got that from the library.

496
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,999
Well...

497
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,664
you look like a runner.

498
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,873
- I do?
- You do.

499
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,012
Thanks.

500
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:29,223
the marathon is
the ultimate test of fortitude.

501
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:33,889
Therefore, once the decision to run
has been made...

502
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,663
Father Hibbert?

503
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,002
I think, as a rule, the more tension,
your steps get shorter.

504
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,734
But let's talk about that later.

505
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,470
All right. I'm asking.

506
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,983
What's with the outfit?

507
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,984
Well, just like the martyrs,
I'm embracing pain.

508
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,646
The more pain I can take,
the better runner I'll be.

509
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,950
If I can get used to running
with all this stuff on...

510
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,617
imagine how much better I'll run
when I finally take it off.

511
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,726
Father, how'd you do
in the 1936 Olympics?

512
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,636
What did you say?

513
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,137
You ran the 1936
Olympic Marathon for Canada.

514
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,264
No, I didn't.

515
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,002
- I saw it in a book.
- The book was wrong.

516
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,737
Follow me, gentlemen.
Come along, Mr. Walker.

517
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,823
Ralph, what's wrong?

518
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,488
I'm fine.

519
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,122
Just a little light-headed...

520
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,791
that's all.

521
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,903
You fainted.

522
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,272
Yeah, I'm fine.

523
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,679
I might have run too far today.

524
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,776
You run? Cross-country?

525
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,617
No. The marathon.

526
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,190
The marathon?

527
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,957
I used to train with
the Finnish marathoners.

528
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,996
You were a runner?

529
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:17,460
No, I was a Canadian nurse
on overseas assignment...

530
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,196
and amateur bobsledder.

531
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,966
If you're serious about training,
you should come over sometime...

532
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,541
and we can lift weights.

533
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,873
Paavo Nurmi did,
and he won nine Olympic gold medals.

534
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,446
Wow.

535
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,220
You okay?

536
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,020
My glucose levels are down.

537
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,856
Claire, listen.

538
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:47,396
The book on martyrs has helped,
but I still can't pray.

539
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:51,832
Well, divine revelations aside,
you've obviously got a serious blockage.

540
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,403
Are you sure you were baptized?

541
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,439
No. And it's kind of hard
to ask anyone right now.

542
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,007
Yeah, sorry.

543
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:02,943
Why don't you try rubbing your knees
with sandpaper until they bleed...

544
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,447
and then kneeling down
in a pan of alcohol to pray?

545
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,454
What grit paper?

546
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,794
I thought I had a big appetite.

547
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,563
What's with the gluttony?

548
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,569
I'm trying to win
the Boston Marathon.

549
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,142
It's actually true.

550
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,905
You think you can
perform a miracle?

551
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,480
Yeah.

552
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,650
Weirdo.

553
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,452
Let's get out of here.

554
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,394
What do you think that kid is doin'?

555
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,595
I have absolutely no idea.

556
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,736
Isn't that the kid
with the mother in the coma?

557
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,976
He was caught strangling
his chicken in a pool.

558
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,545
That's the one.

559
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:47,277
Ralph, it's not like you're permanently
gonna deep-freeze your dick.

560
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,148
Chester, think about it.

561
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:52,848
The martyrs swam in the St. Lawrence
during winter to purify themselves.

562
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,424
Why can't I?

563
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,870
Goddamn it.

564
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,065
Well, that's the sin of blasphemy.

565
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,834
- Sorry.
- Come on. Lift the weight!

566
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,702
- Sorry.
- Be a man! Be a man!

567
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,169
Be a man.

568
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:00,649
You know, you can come
to our house for Christmas.

569
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,521
I'll be fine.

570
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,924
My cousins from Chatham
will be here.

571
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,497
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

572
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,201
Besides, I have my race.

573
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,430
Okay, careful.

574
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,979
Visiting hours are over.

575
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,945
My mother's room is in 309.
I know where it is.

576
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,216
As I've already said,
visiting hours are over.

577
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,792
But Nurse Alice always lets me
go in anyway.

578
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,528
I'm not Nurse Alice.
Visiting hours are over.

579
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,329
Please. It's Christmas Eve.

580
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,459
You can see your mother
first thing tomorrow.

581
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,248
Don't tell me you're planning
on running the whole race.

582
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:34,181
I was gonna ask you
the same thing, granddad.

583
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,752
Runners, on your mark.

584
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,753
Three, two, one... -

585
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:44,558
Slow down, kid.
You'll never last 10 miles at that pace.

586
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,789
There's only one way to find out.

587
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,031
- Who's that kid?
- I've never seen him before.

588
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,908
I knew you wouldn't last.

589
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,526
How was the race?

590
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,860
- I lost.
- And?

591
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,661
I thought I was gonna win.

592
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,895
I've only got 14 good weeks
of training until Boston.

593
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,904
Fourteen weeks is a lifetime.

594
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,212
Stop.

595
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,783
- How many miles a week are you running?
- Sixty.

596
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,284
- That's not nearly enough.
- It isn't?

597
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,079
- Longboat said it should be plenty.
- Longboat?

598
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,089
Longboat went insane.

599
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,790
What are you doing for workouts?

600
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,226
Well, every run,
I go as hard as I can...

601
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,355
and I eat five raw eggs
for breakfast...

602
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:31,366
and I always sleep
with my head facing north.

603
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,163
It's complete idiocy.

604
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,831
I can tell you right now,
you're never gonna win Boston.

605
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,374
But if you still insist on running it,
I'll coach you.

606
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,407
- I knew you'd come around.
- You did? How?

607
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,607
I could see it in your eyes.

608
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,082
Well, then you're as nuts
as Longboat.

609
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,812
I'll coach you
only on one condition... -

610
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,388
you promise never to mention
anything about miracles.

611
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,855
Just mine or all miracles?

612
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,983
Yours.

613
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,062
I have nothing against miracles
in general.

614
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,649
I think Tennyson got it right
with that one.

615
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,223
Don't you, Mom?

616
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,752
Usually I hate poetry...

617
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,919
but we've been learning
this new poem in English...

618
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,497
and I've decided to memorize
the whole thing...

619
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,361
you know,
just for when I get bored.

620
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:40,570
Ralph, come quick. I think I found
something that'll help you pray.

621
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,804
Go on, Ralph. Touch it.

622
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,210
Look, I heard the nurses talking.
He just died.

623
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,873
Even the family doesn't know.

624
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:56,783
I mean, his soul could be
going to heaven right now...

625
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,354
and if you connect with that...

626
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,355
that could break
your whole prayer blockage.

627
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,391
So come on. Close your eyes
and say a Hail Mary.

628
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,586
He's cold.

629
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,890
- I think we missed it.
- Close your eyes.

630
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,761
Hail Mary, full of grace.

631
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:14,634
Dear God, please tell me there's
a rational explanation for all this.

632
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,404
- You still watching my back?
- Yes.

633
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,982
Keep your arms relaxed.
Shake them out.

634
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:29,211
- How's your breathing?
- Fine.

635
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:45,134
Yes. You shouldn't have tried
to stay with me when I surged.

636
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,362
Now you're broken.
Once you break, it's over.

637
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,371
In running, you can never recover.

638
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,168
You can redline all you want...

639
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,574
but you never go past the breaking point
until the final sprint.

640
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,168
All right?

641
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,510
- You okay?
- Fine.

642
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,378
Okay.

643
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,850
Jog easy for five minutes,
and then we'll try again.

644
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,021
By the way, you have
an incredible capacity for work.

645
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,991
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

646
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,996
Read it.

647
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,735
wife of the late Grant Walker...

648
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:29,271
passed away on January 7, 1949.

649
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,948
She died of a heart attack.

650
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,577
- Grace Wa"...-
- That's enough.

651
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,047
Obviously, it has come
to my attention...

652
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,283
that your grandparents are dead.

653
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,755
No, they're not, Father.

654
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,628
Are you suggesting
the obituary's fiction?

655
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,531
No, not at all, Father.

656
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,627
Then what am I missing?

657
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,205
I've seen their graves.

658
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,771
Section 16, row 12, plot 6...

659
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,778
Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.

660
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:08,746
Oh, you mean my dad's parents.

661
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,877
I thought you were
talking about my mom's.

662
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,888
And where do they live?

663
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,093
Ireland.

664
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,358
Well, maybe it's time
you visited them.

665
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,223
Maybe it's also time you explained
who wrote all of these notes.

666
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:28,031
I know you don't have the writing skills
to pull something like this off.

667
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,042
So, what are you giving up for Lent?

668
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,748
Self-abuse.

669
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,513
Impossible.

670
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,251
If you could do that,
you'd have your miracle.

671
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,122
Chester?

672
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,597
Fitz knows the notes are fake.

673
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,165
Oh, shit.

674
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,901
You didn't tell him it was me?

675
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,906
Don't be an idiot.

676
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,908
Fitz has no idea who wrote them.

677
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,271
I'm done.

678
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,404
My penmanship will sink me.

679
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:16,151
I'm in a life that might sink me.

680
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,264
Kid's lookin' better.

681
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,795
At least he's not running backwards.

682
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,164
Good. Stay on pace.

683
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,741
Don't get caught up in the surges.

684
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,209
And don't go into oxygen debt.
Breathe.

685
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,779
Use your arms.

686
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,780
Stride 20 feet.

687
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:20,349
Good.

688
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:28,091
5:28. Good man.

689
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,687
That's enough for today.

690
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,030
You look great.
How do you feel?

691
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:37,523
Like I could eat mountains.

692
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,534
I know that feeling.

693
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,536
So why'd you quit running?

694
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,506
Two weeks before Berlin, I got injured.
My knee went out.

695
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,406
There was no way
I was gonna come back in time.

696
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:58,420
I was 20 years old
and the fastest marathoner in Canada.

697
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:04,825
I was disappointed, to say the least,
but I knew there'd be other Olympics.

698
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,955
The war came,
and I joined the priesthood.

699
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,358
You joined the priesthood
because of the war?

700
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,070
I hope not.

701
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,974
The day I entered the seminary
was the last I ever ran.

702
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,176
Why?

703
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,573
They told me Basilians don't run.

704
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,843
Should've joined theJesuits.

705
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,355
Not one day of missed running
in the last 42.

706
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,736
I now can bench-press
almost a hundred pounds...

707
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,067
and stay in the water
for almost five minutes.

708
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,205
Mom, I think we're closing in
on miracle country.

709
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,980
Sorry it's gonna take so long.

710
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,481
My mom says she saw you
running in Dundas.

711
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,284
Did you jog all the way?

712
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,226
Maybe.

713
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,885
That's a long way...

714
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,297
even to drive.

715
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,660
Thanks.

716
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,170
Your documentation
is very thorough, Father.

717
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:59,504
Yes, Ralph Walker
has fallen through the net.

718
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:03,067
But the Children's Aid Society has
no authority to just come in and take him.

719
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,011
Takes time.

720
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,878
A few weeks, at least.

721
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,178
In the meantime,
he stays by himself?

722
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:13,252
Legally, it's a loophole,
but we follow the law.

723
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,914
What about the boy's welfare?

724
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,425
Is that really what's
at stake here, Father?

725
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,290
What do you mean?

726
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,557
You once had my welfare in mind.

727
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,292
Grade-nine Latin.

728
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,836
49.5 final mark, if I recall.

729
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,838
Surely there was room
in my participation mark.

730
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,340
You sat in the back row.

731
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,774
My welfare never had
the chance to thank you...

732
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,312
for the two months I spent
with you that summer...

733
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,111
rereading the stories
of Caecilius, Lucretia...

734
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,483
and their stupid,
stupid dog Grumio.

735
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,788
Good day, Father.

736
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:58,658
I still don't think you're ready for
this workout, especially in the dark.

737
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,965
I love running in the rain.
Of course I'm ready.

738
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,302
Besides, I'll be getting
the full moon effect as well.

739
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,308
Forget about the full moon.
You can hardly see the moon.

740
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,708
Dennis Longboat
was institutionalized.

741
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,907
But Canadians ran great under him,
and they've done nothing since.

742
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,046
All right, let's get this over with.

743
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,714
- Ready?
- Yeah.

744
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,289
Set.

745
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,984
Run.

746
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,438
Reach! Reach, reach!

747
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,346
Reach! Reach!

748
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:52,119
Good. 4:46. Not bad.

749
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,689
Run.

750
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,901
4:51. Very good.

751
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:11,473
Go.

752
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,450
4:33. Number 10.
You're halfway there, Ralph.

753
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:33,928
Pick it up. You're falling off pace.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

754
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,657
4:56.

755
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:38,393
Use your arms. Use your arms,
Mr. Walker. Use your arms.

756
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,940
Stride. Stride.
Old Longboat would be proud.

757
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:48,499
Use your arms. Use your arms.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

758
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,312
4:53. Take it.

759
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,720
I thought I had one more to do.

760
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:00,687
You do.

761
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,158
Where are you going?

762
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,657
I think you should do this one
without me.

763
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:08,788
Why?

764
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,196
You'll get more
out of the moon alone.

765
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,818
Stay on pace.

766
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:37,620
Be a martyr. Be a martyr.

767
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,926
Relax your arms, Ralph.

768
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,004
You heard me.
Relax your arms.

769
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,328
See? I told you it'd work.

770
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,512
4:25.2.

771
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,312
That's your fastest mile of the 20.

772
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,785
Congratulations.
You were flying, young man!

773
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,719
I know.

774
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,792
It felt great.

775
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:45,360
All right, stand up,
before you cramp.

776
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,098
All right, jog home. Slowly.

777
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,962
Loosen up your legs
and go straight to bed.

778
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:52,625
- Yeah.
- I'll have that watch.

779
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:56,664
Good job.

780
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:59,139
- Thanks for timing me.
- You're welcome.

781
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,274
You know, I never thought
you'd be able to make that workout.

782
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,005
Thought it would break you.

783
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,980
I don't want to be an orphan.

784
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,988
You'll win Around the Bay
on Sunday.

785
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,251
- I will?
- You will.

786
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:17,826
What about Boston?

787
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:20,054
They're entirely different beasts.

788
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,334
Good night, Mr. Walker.

789
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,130
Good night, Father Hibbert.

790
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,672
Back for more, kid?

791
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,203
- I suppose I am.
- Ready! Set!

792
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,777
You'll never finish.

793
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,392
You wanted to see me, Father?

794
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,960
Do you know anything about this?

795
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:00,769
Yes.

796
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,337
He's come a long way.

797
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:06,374
He says that he's going to win
the Boston Marathon.

798
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:10,879
He also says that it will be
a miracle when he does.

799
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,845
It will be.

800
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,611
- He won't win.
- That's not what I mean.

801
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,549
How long have you been
coaching him?

802
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:23,624
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it coaching. More like...

803
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,694
steering him in
the right direction, if you... -

804
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,353
Semantics.

805
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,556
I thought I'd made myself
very clear.

806
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,032
- You did, Father.
- Then?

807
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,799
He needed help.

808
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,964
Ralph Walker does not need...

809
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,440
that kind of help.

810
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:43,478
He needs to learn
his place in the world.

811
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,879
All of our students
need this from us.

812
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,713
It's what we do as teachers,
Father Hibbert.

813
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:51,684
It's our gift!

814
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,925
Tell him it's over.

815
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,128
That he can't run Boston?

816
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:05,593
But, of course, he can.

817
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:08,330
It's outside of school jurisdiction.
You can't control that.

818
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,167
Watch me.

819
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,798
If Ralph Walker runs Boston...

820
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,638
and is absent from this school...

821
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:18,111
his career as a student is over
here at St. Magnus.

822
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,739
That's my jurisdiction.

823
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,178
And if you have any part of it...

824
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,186
you are done with this order.

825
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:27,547
There have already
been discussions.

826
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,625
His mother is dying.

827
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,318
And that's...

828
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:34,692
the reason he is still
a student here.

829
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,357
I'm trying to help the boy.

830
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,997
He'll be put in a home
as soon as the paperwork is done.

831
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,742
Thank you.

832
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,573
That's all, Father Hibbert.

833
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,049
Yes, Father.

834
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:02,120
it is paramount that
all distractions disappear.

835
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,921
It's equally important
that all doubts...

836
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:07,053
be cast aside.

837
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:11,361
Remember, the marathon
is not without adversity...

838
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,042
You're certainly no martyr.

839
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,983
I'm not even going in deep... yet.

840
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:33,613
Somehow, when you said massage, I was
thinking of something totally different.

841
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:36,817
It's only a bruise. In a couple of days
you'll be just fine.

842
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,630
Mr. Walker.

843
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:44,699
What happened?

844
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,701
- I fell.
- You fell?

845
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,864
Ralph, you're not gonna
be able to run Boston.

846
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,669
The race is 10 days away.
Of course I'm gonna run.

847
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,403
You broke your promise to me.

848
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,806
You said you'd never
mention miracles.

849
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,882
is the miracle my mother will need
to get out of her coma."

850
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:09,424
- We had a deal, Ralph.
- I didn't break my promise.

851
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:11,652
I thought you meant
not to mention miracles to you.

852
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,319
Well, you thought wrong.

853
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,863
- That's not fair!
- Listen to me, Ralph.

854
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,968
Father Fitzpatrick says
he'll expel you...

855
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,536
if you run.

856
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:25,095
I'd never let a priest tell me
whether I can or cannot run.

857
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,639
- I learned that from you.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

858
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,372
Thanks.

859
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:34,609
I'll sell the rest of the stuff
in the house...

860
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:37,083
and I'll use the money to pay
for a train ticket to Boston.

861
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:38,881
But you can't run.

862
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,286
Fitz is gonna
kick you out of school.

863
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,950
Hibbert's right.
Call it off.

864
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:47,393
I'm running. Besides,
I'm getting kicked out already.

865
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,432
It's only a matter of time,
so I have nothing to lose.

866
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,694
You have everything to lose.

867
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:56,329
You've set yourself up to be
the laughingstock of Hamilton.

868
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,839
Trust me.
People are talking.

869
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:02,900
Chester, I honestly don't care
what anybody's saying.

870
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:05,606
See, that's the difference
between me and you.

871
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,842
Your knee's wrecked,
you can't pray...

872
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,508
you're certainly not pure...

873
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,247
and your mother has been
in a coma for seven months.

874
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:14,482
She's not coming out.

875
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,918
She is so.

876
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:19,324
No, she is not.

877
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,092
Goddamn you.

878
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:32,368
Hey, hey.
Hey! Stop! Break it up!

879
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,999
I forged letters for you!

880
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,737
I put myself on the line!

881
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:38,814
No, you didn't, Chester!
You've never put yourself on the line!

882
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,448
- Hello?
- Ralph, it's Claire.

883
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,789
I was wondering if you wanted to go
to Holy Thursday mass with me.

884
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:53,657
You know,
work on your praying?

885
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,663
Holy Thursday.

886
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,232
Let me see.

887
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:04,065
Yes, I believe I'm free.
Thanks.

888
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,114
Don't you just love Holy Week?

889
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,255
Nice try, Ralph.

890
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,457
Seducing me on Holy Thursday?

891
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,360
Did you think
I was gonna fall for that?

892
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,068
- Honest, I thought you wanted to.
- Me?

893
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,403
Ralph, I'm supposed to be a nun.

894
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,736
And all I was trying to do
was help you with a miracle.

895
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,642
And now look what you've done.

896
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,500
Wake up.

897
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,701
Wake up. Wake up.

898
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,766
Wake up.

899
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,270
Wake up!

900
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,740
Wake up!

901
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:30,552
Wake up!

902
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,315
Wake up! Wake up!

903
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:36,550
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Ralph!
What are you doing?

904
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,456
I thought the music
might wake her up.

905
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,621
- Well, it won't.
- I know.

906
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,825
I know.

907
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,492
Oh, honey.

908
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:13,214
Where's the boy?

909
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,785
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

910
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,867
I'm sorry about your house.

911
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:37,262
Yeah, me too.

912
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:40,408
Could have been worse.

913
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,007
I don't even have
a picture of them.

914
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,577
At least you're not dead.

915
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,487
And don't worry.
Arrangements have been made...

916
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,056
for you to stay temporarily
at Chester's house.

917
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:58,018
Thanks, Father.

918
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,594
Am I correct in assuming...

919
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,721
that your Boston Marathon
quest is over?

920
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:16,302
Well, you are in all our prayers.

921
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,747
Thanks, Father.

922
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:33,828
Don't listen to him.

923
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,298
Fitz was right.

924
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,358
You were right.

925
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:42,596
She's not coming out
of the coma.

926
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,207
I'm not running.

927
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,004
Goddamn it...

928
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,011
you just burned
your house down.

929
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:54,282
The least you could do
is run Boston.

930
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,277
What's the point?

931
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,355
Nothing would
piss Fitz off more.

932
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:01,923
And...

933
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,295
l... -

934
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,097
I believe you can win the race.

935
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,289
Father Hibbert?

936
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,952
Father Fitzpatrick.

937
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:16,254
I just wanted to let you know
I won't be at school on Monday.

938
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:17,662
And why is that?

939
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:20,768
I'm going to Boston.

940
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,036
It's the least I can do for Ralph.

941
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:31,612
It's why I joined the priesthood... -
to help people.

942
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:34,148
Best way for you to help Ralph Walker
is to convince him...

943
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:37,412
that running Boston
is the biggest mistake of his life.

944
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:38,986
Is it, Father?

945
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:42,990
We are God's servants.
Chasing after miracles is blasphemy.

946
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,197
You know what?

947
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,269
Before I met that young man...

948
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,167
I didn't much believe in anything.

949
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:02,343
But now I'm starting to think
that one day, when my time is up...

950
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:10,717
Did you ever not know
and still jump?

951
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:13,947
Did you ever just
close your eyes and...

952
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:16,958
let go?"

953
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,962
Right now, Father, my answer...

954
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,829
So I am closing my eyes.

955
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,873
You're blind.
You're as deluded as Ralph.

956
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:34,738
And there will be
serious ramifications...

957
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,471
not only in this school,
but within the Basilian order.

958
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,545
I know.

959
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:42,207
Thank you.

960
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,111
As far as anarchists go...

961
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:50,525
Nietzsche really had nothing
on Christ.

962
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:53,294
You know?

963
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:55,963
All right.

964
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,278
Now boarding on track 14...

965
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:22,517
train 72 to Buffalo
with connections to Raleigh... -

966
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:26,185
- Ticket to Boston, please.
- Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland... -

967
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:47,481
Did you see this?

968
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:56,489
who recently lost his house to fire...

969
01:14:56,592 --> 01:15:00,028
hopes that his winning ways
continue in Boston.

970
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:03,996
The race will be broadcast live
on CHCH Radio starting at noon.

971
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:07,496
Oddsmakers give him
an outside chance at best."

972
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:11,165
Screw it.

973
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:13,104
He's got more
than an outside chance.

974
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,908
When we reached Mr. Walker,
he told us that...

975
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:29,722
who has been coaching Ralph Walker
for the past few months...

976
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:32,851
says that it is entirely possible...

977
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:34,895
that the ninth grader...

978
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,794
could win Boston.

979
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:40,493
Miracles happen every day."

980
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,506
Damn him.

981
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:52,380
Thanks.

982
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,358
You're wasting energy.
Sit down.

983
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,523
- Father Hibbert, when did you get here?
- Just now.

984
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:12,429
You think I'd miss the greatest upset
in Boston Marathon history?

985
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,001
Sit.

986
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,632
What about Father Fitzpatrick?

987
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:22,039
Yes, well, we'll worry about him later.
Are you ready?

988
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,311
Mostly.

989
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,903
Do you have faith you can win?

990
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,572
I do.

991
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:31,142
But I'm still not pure,
and I can't pray.

992
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:35,256
Well, if you promise not to take the lead
until at least halfway...

993
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,325
I can solve your purity problem.

994
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,224
- How?
- Do you promise?

995
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:42,463
Yes.

996
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:44,088
And I mean it this time.

997
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:47,535
All right.

998
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,863
All I have to do
is hear your confession.

999
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,100
Then I can absolve you
of your sins...

1000
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,342
and guess who's pure.

1001
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,611
Father Hibbert...

1002
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:00,045
why didn't I think of that earlier?

1003
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:02,514
I could have been sinning
all along.

1004
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,054
That's not exactly
in the spirit of reconciliation.

1005
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,389
Shall we do it now?

1006
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,219
No.

1007
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:12,691
Let's wait until
the last moment possible.

1008
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,695
Who knows what sins of thought
might go through my head?

1009
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:19,567
But there's still praying.
I can't do it.

1010
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,467
Well, for myself,
in times of greatest stress...

1011
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,733
I've always been able to pray.

1012
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:27,536
So I wouldn't worry about it.

1013
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:29,935
Most marathoners will tell you...

1014
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:32,240
around mile 20...

1015
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:34,815
they start praying for any kind
of help they can get.

1016
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,648
The weather is unsettled,
with showers threatening...

1017
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:48,484
though for the moment
the skies are holding.

1018
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,057
And so...

1019
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:53,685
welcome to the 53rd running
of the Boston Marathon...

1020
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:56,696
one of the world's
most prestigious footraces.

1021
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:58,823
Our field is strong this year...

1022
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,836
and, given the current cool conditions,
ripe for a fast time.

1023
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:06,300
They're bunched at the line.

1024
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:33,930
The race is under way.
I repeat, the race is under way.

1025
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:45,704
At five miles, there's a large group
of 20 or so runners.

1026
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:47,805
In there are all the favorites...

1027
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:51,716
including the greatJohn Bannon,
the defending champ...

1028
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,811
the Finn, John Halvorson...

1029
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:55,685
Red Sparks from Maryland...

1030
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,692
Edward Croggin from California...

1031
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,921
Alan Majors from Ireland... -

1032
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:05,523
Excuse me for the interruption...

1033
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:08,728
but this is a special broadcast
of the Boston Marathon...

1034
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:12,136
in which one of our students,
Ralph Walker, hopes to win.

1035
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,639
I, for one, think he'll do it.

1036
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:18,645
He won Around the Bay, and there's no
reason why he can't do the same in Boston.

1037
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:22,615
Not a three-mile race,
though the Boston Irish community...

1038
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:25,777
- is showing all sorts of encouragement.
- What's going on, Miss Roddy?

1039
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:28,583
Bannon is running strong.

1040
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,214
Who's in there?
Open this door!

1041
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,987
Open up!
Who's in there? Open up!

1042
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:37,758
Open up!

1043
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,959
Down Beacon Street
toward the Charles River.

1044
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:44,505
It's a drop of 150 feet
that is brutal on tired legs.

1045
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,574
Who will survive
this punishment?

1046
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:51,541
I knew he was the forger.

1047
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,341
Mr. Jones!

1048
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,912
Open up this door
immediately!

1049
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,678
It's early in the game still.

1050
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:59,617
There are 10 runners tightly bunched.

1051
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,916
The winner will surely
come from this group.

1052
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,048
There are all the usual suspects...

1053
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,525
and one surprising addition... -

1054
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:08,289
runner 157.

1055
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:09,988
Let me see.

1056
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:12,760
Ralph Walker from Canada...

1057
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,563
age 14... -

1058
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:21,538
But give the lad credit
for gumption in hanging in this long.!

1059
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:25,135
The runners arejust approaching
the first water station on West Central.

1060
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:28,944
We're eight miles into this thing, folks,
and Bannon is leading... - not surprising... -

1061
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:33,146
closely followed by Fox and Monahan
and this kid Walker.

1062
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:36,452
- The sun has come out again.
- Mr. Jones!

1063
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,288
Relatively flat for the next few miles.

1064
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:40,952
It's no use.

1065
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:45,163
The PA room used to be the school safe.
You'd have to dynamite it open.

1066
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:47,867
Don't tempt me.
Get it open.

1067
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:49,630
The runners are approaching
11 miles...

1068
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,969
and are about to round the Natick
town commons with Bannon in the lead.

1069
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:56,976
Halvorson and Monahan are still very much
in the race, as is Ralph Walker.

1070
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:58,875
You look fantastic. Be patient.

1071
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,175
Be patient!
Stay exactly where you are!

1072
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:03,717
You heard right, folks.
I can't believe it either.

1073
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:06,150
Ralph Walker is running
with the leaders.

1074
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,018
The youngest previous winner
of this race was Edmond Davy...

1075
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:11,217
who was 20 years old.

1076
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,557
The weather has cleared,
but rain still threatens.

1077
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,995
The pack continues to remain
tightly bunched...

1078
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,225
and there's plenty ofjostling
for position.

1079
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:22,895
I'vejust got word that Fox has bumped
Walker in an attempt to get to the lead.

1080
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:25,131
The kid was hit hard
but has surged back...

1081
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,209
and is trying to put some distance
between himself and the rest of the field.

1082
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,710
Bannon needs to go with him.

1083
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:33,144
We're too far into this race
for anyone to be pretending.

1084
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:35,307
Ralph Walker is definitely a threat.

1085
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:37,544
He wasn't on anyone's radar
before the race...

1086
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,882
and he's leading
the Boston Marathon.

1087
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:42,548
A 14-year-old
is leading the Boston Marathon.!

1088
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:45,888
Bannon is closing the gap
and is now back with Walker.

1089
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:49,760
Fox has dropped off and appears done,
as has Monahan.

1090
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:53,630
Folks, it's down to two as we approach
Heartbreak Hill at 19 miles.

1091
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:56,431
This is the spot that Bannon
made his move last year.

1092
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,005
It looks like Bannon is moving.

1093
01:22:58,106 --> 01:23:00,438
His head is down,
and he's starting to press.

1094
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:03,375
Bannon is looking very strong,
and Walker is now struggling.

1095
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,412
This could be the race.

1096
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,708
Walker is definitely in trouble.
Bannon is pressing.

1097
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,580
Hail Mary, full of grace,
don't redline.

1098
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,915
You can do it, Ralph.

1099
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:18,919
You can do it, Ralph!

1100
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:20,995
You can do it! It'll be a miracle!

1101
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:24,497
Come on! Run, Walker! Run!

1102
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,134
Run!

1103
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:31,268
- Walker's marathon looks to be over.
- Run!

1104
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:33,398
He can't have anything left
at this point.

1105
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,341
Wait.! It appears that Walker
is not quite finished.

1106
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:38,241
Incredibly, he's coming back.!

1107
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,572
Folks, I can't believe it.

1108
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,845
Walker's with Bannon again,
and now they're through the hills.

1109
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:48,082
We only have two miles left, and Walker
and Bannon are matched step for step.

1110
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:52,250
Reports are that both runners look
exhausted but are not slowing down.

1111
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,322
They're coming up
Coolidge Corner.

1112
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:00,526
The crowds have increased
as we approach the finish.

1113
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,803
Walker has pulled even again.

1114
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:07,033
He's not backing down one bit
from the greatJohn Bannon.

1115
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:10,139
And they are rounding
the final corner.!

1116
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:14,045
Here we go, folks.!
365 yards to go.!

1117
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,674
They're dead even on the 26th mile.!
Who would believe it?

1118
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:18,946
Run, you bastard. Run.

1119
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,522
The kid has got legs.
But can he hold on?

1120
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:24,683
This just might be the closest
Boston finish in history.!

1121
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,784
Walker and Bannon,
step for step.!

1122
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,523
Bannon's straining.!
I've never seen him look this tired.!

1123
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:33,158
The crowds are going crazy.!
The noise is deafening.!

1124
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,168
They've been waiting
hours for this.!

1125
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,965
Walker surges.!
Walker surges.!

1126
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,972
He has a half step on Bannon.!

1127
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,838
No.! Bannon answers.!
They're dead even again.!

1128
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:43,877
And neither one is breaking.!

1129
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:47,209
Bannon is giving everything he's got,
and Walker is still not letting up.!

1130
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:50,580
100 yards to go, and Walker
has now taken the lead.!

1131
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:54,052
- They're closing in on the finish line.!
- Win it.

1132
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,755
They're coming down the stretch,
ladies and gentlemen.!

1133
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,828
Who would believe it? Bannon's never
been tested like this before.

1134
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,897
Fifty yards to go.!

1135
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:05,363
Bannon now slightly ahead.
Does Walker have one last surge?

1136
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,332
Walker giving it everything he has!

1137
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,596
The runners appear utterly drained...

1138
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:11,467
but they are sprinting...

1139
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,871
willing themselves to the finish line.!

1140
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:17,433
This is now a battle of wills,
sheer determination.!

1141
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:35,022
Bannon's starting to move.!

1142
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,927
Bannon is starting to move.!

1143
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:39,829
Walker's got to go now
ifhe has any hope of winning.!

1144
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:44,132
Bannon still has the lead
and is driving furiously for the line.!

1145
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,434
And John Bannon wins Boston.!

1146
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:49,669
John Bannon wins
the Boston Marathon.!

1147
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:55,983
The 1953 champion repeats
in spectacular fashion.!

1148
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:58,746
The laurel wreath is his.!

1149
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:01,947
It took 26 miles to decide it...

1150
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:04,388
but we finally have a winner.!

1151
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:07,387
Oh, my goodness.!

1152
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:12,660
I can't remember a marathon
ever coming down to the wire like this.!

1153
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:17,232
You havejust been a part
of sporting history.!

1154
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:56,192
You did us all proud.

1155
01:28:58,066 --> 01:28:59,693
I lost.

1156
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:05,034
You made us feel like
we were all part of something big.

1157
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:08,040
That doesn't happen every day.

1158
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:15,272
I believed I was gonna win.

1159
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:23,376
Ralph Walker defied me,
and you defied me.

1160
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:25,111
Well, he followed his heart.

1161
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:28,255
Walker! Walker!

1162
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:40,265
I spoke to the press this morning
about your instrumental role...

1163
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:42,836
in Mr. Walker's marathoning success.

1164
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:46,968
Probably wouldn't look too good
if I had to turn around and tell them...

1165
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,440
you kicked St. Magnus's
most famous student out.

1166
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:51,974
No, probably not.

1167
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:04,320
I think he may still
need my prayers.

1168
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:07,421
We all do, Father.

1169
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,022
We all do.

1170
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:16,764
I still can't believe
you actually did it.

1171
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:19,673
Me either.

1172
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:22,800
I never thought I'd have suspension
on my permanent record.

1173
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:25,312
Are you all right?

1174
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:29,672
Somehow I think it all
mostly worked out...

1175
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:31,911
even though my mom didn't
come out of her coma.

1176
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:36,381
My mom says we could adopt you.

1177
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,921
I'm too old to be adopted, Chester.

1178
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:43,130
Yeah, I suppose we all
eventually pass that point.

1179
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,301
Thanks, Chester.

1180
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:49,903
You're welcome.

1181
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:10,687
I'm going straight to hell
because of you.

1182
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:13,451
Sorry.

1183
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:15,028
- We could... -
- I'm kidding.

1184
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:17,825
Necking is a venial sin,
not a mortal one.

1185
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:20,628
- God works in mysterious ways.
- He does.

1186
01:32:47,161 --> 01:32:49,391
- Father Hibbert!
- Mr. Walker.

1187
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:54,132
I was wondering what
your running plans are for the future.

1188
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,260
Well, what are your coaching plans?

1189
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:58,065
That depends.

1190
01:32:58,172 --> 01:33:01,608
Well, the Olympics are next year,
and I suppose I intend to win them.

1191
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:06,413
Well, if we're not chasing after miracles,
what's the point, eh?

1192
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:08,072
I couldn't agree with you more.

1193
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:38,239
Ralph?

1194
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:44,440
