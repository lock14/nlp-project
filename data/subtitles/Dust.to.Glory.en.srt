00:00:26:Weatherman to all checkpoints.
00:00:28:I'm looking for status on 99 Alpha, please,|between Valle de Trinidad and Milling.
00:00:38:They race the clock|in a land that defies time.
00:00:41:sharing an adventure in a place|where reality is on holiday.
00:00:45:It's the most beautiful place in the world.|It's the most scary place in the world.
00:00:49:And it's the most|desolate, quiet place.
00:00:51:You love it, you hate it, you love it,|you hate it, you love it, you hate it.
00:00:54:You don't wanna be there,|you wanna be there.
00:00:55:It's like a girl that breaks your heart.
00:00:57:"l hate you, I never|wanna see you again.
00:00:59:I'm sorry.|Can I come over?"
00:01:01:You look up at the stars|and there's no smog.
00:01:03:You smell the ocean breeze,|you hear the birds.
00:01:06:You hear the whales,|you hear the seals.
00:01:08:I think Baja gives you|that opportunity to feel that,
00:01:12:to get closer to something|that's more instinctual.
00:01:15:It's difficult to put into words|because it's an emotion.
00:01:19:That's what Baja is,|something you feel.
00:01:36:What do you call a race where|anybody with any vehicle can enter.
00:01:40:a race where 200.000 spectators|come but no one pays admission.
00:01:45:a race that takes 32 hours|for 1.200 people
00:01:48:to battle 1.000 merciless miles|for a million different reasons?
00:01:51:Call it the Tecate Score Baja 1 000.
00:01:55:Someone asked Parnelli Jones,
00:01:57:and he said it's like being|in a 24-hour plane crash.
00:02:00:'Cause the 1000,|so much can go on.
00:02:03:Think about what happens,|you know, in the Daytona 500.
00:02:07:And they're going|around a smooth track,
00:02:08:and the pit's|in the same spot every time.
00:02:11:You know, we got|buses and cows and horses and...
00:02:14:Mountains and beaches and deserts.
00:02:16:You're in dust, you're in rocks.
00:02:17:It's gullies, it's washouts,|it's 100 miles an hour, 20 miles an hour.
00:02:21:So many roads out there,|and little ranches here and there.
00:02:24:Every one of these jumps,|every one of these turns
00:02:26:is different than the last one.
00:02:27:Tell you what,|you don't fall asleep here.
00:02:31:I lived it, I ate it, I slept it,|and I can totally understand
00:02:35:when other people|get caught up in the mystique of it,
00:02:38:trying to beat time itself|and get to the finish line.
00:02:41:It's an unreal feeling.
00:03:29:It's only about 100 miles|south of San Diego.
00:03:32:but Ensenada is a whole nother world.
00:03:34:and the closer you get to it.|the more confusing it becomes.
00:03:38:Mouse had the inspiration|and Fish gave his approval.
00:03:41:but it was my good buddy Scott Waugh|who convinced me to make this movie
00:03:44:about the longest nonstop
00:03:45:point-to-point race in the world.
00:03:47:My name is Dana Brown.
00:03:49:And when I thought I knew.|I hadn't a clue.
00:03:59:We got Dana Brown.|Dana just came out of Step Into Liquid.
00:04:02:They are doing a feature|called Dust to Glory
00:04:05:on the Tecate Score Baja 1 000.
00:04:07:That's Sal Fish. He's in charge.
00:04:09:An honest promoter.
00:04:11:Why not? This whole thing started|with a stuntman nicknamed after a rodent.
00:04:16:- There's the odds.|- Hey, we're three-to-one.
00:04:18:Look at this.|I'm two-to-one favorite.
00:04:21:This is Mouse. a real force of nature.
00:04:24:Somehow you always end up doing|whatever he's doing.
00:04:27:Take his posse--one legend|and two childhood friends.
00:04:30:Also getting sucked into Mouse's orbit|were the Griders. Andy and Neil.
00:04:33:Andy won the 1 000 last year.
00:04:35:- Can you bet this?|- Y eah, at Caliente.
00:04:38:Hey, Billy, you can bet this|at Caliente.
00:04:41:Let's put some odds on ourselves.|Let's go bet on ourselves.
00:04:45:I think in Mexico you can do that.|It's not like...
00:04:47:Who's that guy--Pete Rose?
00:04:49:Seems like everybody|enters the 1000.
00:04:51:They've raced everything here|from Rolls-Royces to Winnebagos.
00:04:54:The Bago didn't make it very far.
00:04:57:These racers are|from all walks of life.
00:04:59:including the prodigal son.|the Hawaiian surfer.
00:05:02:the father. son. and grandson.|King of the Beetles.
00:05:05:Team Estrogen.|the perennial champs.
00:05:07:the greatest ever.|and those Indy dudes.
00:05:09:They don't close|the race course off for anybody.
00:05:13:You're out there with Joe Public,|or in this case, Jose Public.
00:05:18:For the people of Baja. this is|one of the biggest days of the year.
00:05:21:We can really relate to racing,|off-road racing.
00:05:24:And you meet people,|you just start talking.
00:05:27:Start talking about|the last race, the next race.
00:05:31:"You remember this|and you remember that."
00:05:32:You end up with four|or five guys around you,
00:05:34:and that's called picking up dust|here in this town.
00:05:38:As the party atmosphere fades.
00:05:41:all the contradictions and metaphors|begin to make sense to me.
00:05:44:This isn't about a race.|it's about the race. the human race.
00:05:48:which I figure is exactly|how Sal Fish intended it.
00:05:51:The roads aren't closed.|Locals driving backwards on the course.
00:05:55:You've got locals racing|right next to you.
00:05:57:You've got chase vehicles, and they're|on the course where they shouldn't be.
00:06:01:You know, I mean, this is|not for wusses. Let's face it.
00:06:05:Without question.|Sal Fish is the Baja 1000.
00:06:09:He marks a different course each year.
00:06:10:He deals with the concerns|of the ranchers. of the police.
00:06:14:as well as demands|of contestants and spectators.
00:06:18:I haven't met anyone that has|the stupidity, I guess, that I have
00:06:21:that would do it the way I do.
00:06:23:And I never stop thinking about this.|It's a 24-hour deal and I love it.
00:06:27:Get families together
00:06:29:and guys with the $10,000 vehicle|and guys with the $2 million vehicle.
00:06:33:I could never imagine|having Sal Fish's job.
00:06:36:Having 300 people|like Robby Gordon showing up there
00:06:39:wanting to go racing,|and everybody has their own agenda.
00:06:41:Everybody plays by the same rules.|They all pay the same entry fee.
00:06:44:I wanna make sure|our hardcore grassroot guys
00:06:47:are always at Score|and there's a place for them to race.
00:06:50:Sal's values are reflected|in a race that's open to everyone.
00:06:54:from the little guy to the big guy.|the famous and anonymous--
00:06:57:all equal. all simply racers.
00:07:08:Pre-dawn.
00:07:09:Air temperature. 45 degrees.
00:07:11:Motorcycles and quads|will start three hours ahead of the field.
00:07:14:A flurry of flashbulbs|announces Johnny Campbell's arrival.
00:07:18:A win today would be|a record-breaking seven in a row.
00:07:21:Trying to keep loose|was 62-year-old J. N. Roberts.
00:07:24:a true legend in off-road racing.
00:07:26:Always gotta keep moving.|Harder target to hit.
00:07:30:Mouse arrived.|He's very quiet. Unusually subdued.
00:07:34:Mouse doesn't know this but when|I was a little kid, he was my hero.
00:07:38:He'd go out smokin' everybody.
00:07:40:"Wow, who's this Mouse McCoy?"|Then all of a sudden, disappeared.
00:07:44:I started racing|when I was four years old.
00:07:47:And by 1 7 I was just flat burned out.
00:07:49:Nothing you could do about it.
00:07:51:You don't have any context|of what you're doing as a kid.
00:07:53:All you know is you hate it,|you're done, you're sick of it.
00:07:56:Actually that's the best thing|that's ever happened to me
00:07:58:'cause now I love|riding motorcycles more than ever.
00:08:00:And maybe I wouldn't have loved it|so much had I kept going.
00:08:02:For every bike there's usually|three. four. or five riders.
00:08:06:Johnny Campbell would be riding|the first 205 miles
00:08:09:before handing it over|to Steve Hengeveld.
00:08:11:We'll see ya at the finish line.
00:08:12:J. N. would ride 1 10|before giving it to his son Jimmy.
00:08:16:Mouse McCoy wouldn't|run 100. 200. or even 500 miles.
00:08:21:Mouse had a different plan.
00:08:23:He was gonna race|the entire Baja 1 000 solo.
00:08:28:One man's name is synonymous|for racing the Baja solo--
00:08:31:the Ironman. Ivan Stewart.
00:08:33:Well, to do a 1,000-mile race|in a car is tough,
00:08:37:but at least you can sit down|and get a drink of water
00:08:40:and you're protected a lot more.
00:08:41:And to do it on a motorcycle,|I mean, I can't fathom it. That's tough.
00:08:45:Anybody can trail ride the thing|for the thousand miles.
00:08:48:But to be competitive and do it|was a whole different deal.
00:08:51:And I knew I looked up to him,
00:08:53:and now, wow, I'm really gonna|look up to him if he finishes this thing.
00:08:56:This is gonna be amazing.
00:08:57:People say, "Don't you|worry about your son?"
00:08:59:No, I don't worry about him|because he's gifted.
00:09:02:And he usually gets there.
00:09:04:I think Mouse is one of the best|when it comes to preparing.
00:09:08:He pre-ran down here|more than anybody I've ever seen.
00:09:16:Supercross legend Ricky Johnson.
00:09:18:who's like Mouse's big brother.|had some reservations.
00:09:21:Not because he's a bad rider.|He's a great rider.
00:09:24:Not because he was out of shape.|He was in great shape.
00:09:27:But for those exact things.
00:09:28:He knew how good a shape he was in|and he knew how fast he was.
00:09:32:And I knew if he got into a competition
00:09:34:with other riders that are|fresher, fresher, fresher, fresher,
00:09:38:I was afraid he was gonna die.
00:09:40:Survival. That's all it is.|You survive, you'll win it.
00:09:45:Soft and smooth, brother.|Soft and smooth.
00:09:50:At 6:30 the race began.
00:09:53:They'll leave 30 seconds apart.
00:09:55:At 6:31 and 30 seconds.|Johnny Campbell takes off.
00:09:59:Chris Blaze of the Honda B Team|leaves the line at 6:33.
00:10:04:J. N. Roberts. 6:37:30.
00:10:14:If a car pulls out in front|of a speeding car.
00:10:17:results are dented metal|and possible injury.
00:10:20:If a car pulls out|in front of a speeding motorcycle.
00:10:22:results are probable death.
00:10:24:which was exactly the fate of former|Baja champion Danny Hamel in 1 995.
00:10:30:only a few miles|outside of Ensenada.
00:10:42:Mouse McCoy. 6:37.
00:10:45:And the rhythm|of the race begins.
00:11:08:At 6:46:30. the quads|began to join the fray.
00:11:26:Mile 38. there|is no flagman. No flagman.
00:11:40:By the 50-mile mark. Johnny Campbell|had settled into his usual lead.
00:11:45:In second was Chris Blaze|of the Honda B Team.
00:11:49:Mouse. in an effort|to show his newfound maturity.
00:11:52:had gone from sixteenth|to fourth in the first hour.
00:12:01:For a motorcyclist to compete|at the front of the pack
00:12:04:he has to fully commit.
00:12:05:He has to hurl himself into the void.
00:12:38:Mouse was on fire.
00:12:40:And just as amazing was J. N. Roberts|passing riders a third of his age
00:12:44:until our camera helicopter got|a little close and J. N. went down.
00:12:48:We missed the shot.
00:12:50:And 30 miles away.|Jimmy Roberts had
00:12:52:a sudden premonition|that he'd miss his ride.
00:12:55:If J. N. couldn 't get back|on the bike. their day was over.
00:13:00:It didn 't seem fair.|J. N. 's a living legend.
00:13:03:winner of the first|Baja 1 000 back in 1 967.
00:13:07:That was an era
00:13:08:when as many as 3. 000 riders|would start a California desert race.
00:13:12:and J. N. Roberts|would win 27 in a row.
00:13:15:When I was growing up, of course|he was the man in the desert.
00:13:18:And any time we'd be out|riding motorcycles
00:13:20:and I'd do something that|my dad thought was pretty good,
00:13:22:he'd say, "Oh, all right, J.N.|Good job, J.N."
00:13:24:So J.N. was this|mythical figure in my mind.
00:13:26:So when I had the chance|to actually race with him
00:13:28:it was a pretty awesome|experience for me.
00:13:31:I wanna make sure it works for J.N.
00:13:33:First time back in 30 years|to Baja for him.
00:13:35:It's kind of exciting|to go riding with him.
00:13:37:He can't seem to get the bike|started, though.
00:13:41:- New technology.|- Get it to the top of the stroke.
00:13:47:J.N. won two|of the first three Baja 1000s.
00:13:50:He'd come back to team with Jimmy.|who was racing in his first.
00:13:53:He just recently won|the Vet World Championships.
00:13:55:And now here he is|two weeks later racing Baja.
00:13:57:And then in January|he signs up for Social Security.
00:14:00:So he's had quite a year.
00:14:02:Don't rub it in.|Hey, Social lnsecurity.
00:14:05:Yeah.
00:14:06:J.N. didn't get a lot of time|to reminisce about his past victories
00:14:10:because Jimmy. Mouse. and Greg Tracy|had him on a rigorous pre-run schedule.
00:14:15:Pre-running is when you get to practice|your section of the course.
00:14:19:Now. in Mouse's case.|all the sections were his section.
00:14:21:so J. N. got to do a lot of pre-running.
00:14:24:I'll tell you what, the ol' butt|in the last few days is taking a lickin'.
00:14:27:- Taking a lickin'.|- No pun intended.
00:14:29:We still live in different states,|so we don't see each other all the time.
00:14:33:But when we do see each other,
00:14:34:it's usually around|a motorcycle-based environment.
00:14:37:And he's so, like,|compulsive disorder kind of--
00:14:40:Really goes over things|over and over and over.
00:14:42:And I can see myself when I'm|by myself becoming that a little bit myself.
00:14:47:I love you to death, but some|of your habits drive me crazy.
00:14:50:But the roles reverse. It's just funny.|It's just the way it is. It's life.
00:14:55:Look at the McCoys.|We've seen that yesterday with them.
00:14:57:Yeah, they have|the same relationship, kind of.
00:14:58:They're kind of bagging|on each other all the time.
00:15:01:Like a couple ol' hens|most of the time.
00:15:02:What can you do about it?|It's your blood. They can't fire ya.
00:15:06:Jimmy and J.N. are less father and son.|they're more like clones.
00:15:10:Well, I know I'm|a lot more cautious than he is.
00:15:12:Let's try and be nice.
00:15:14:He's just, you know,|"Yeah, pin it, Dad."
00:15:16:Well, I don't know|what's over that hill.
00:15:18:So I back off and roll it off a little bit
00:15:20:because I'm gonna go home|and cut wood this winter.
00:15:22:I got things I gotta do.|Where he's just got a little more--
00:15:25:You gotta have a little faith,|trust yourself.
00:15:27:I do trust myself,|but that's still who I am.
00:15:30:I don't have it that way, but I think|that comes with doing a lot and age.
00:15:36:J. N. may talk about getting old.
00:15:37:but how many 62-year-olds can|pick up a 300-pound motorcycle?
00:15:41:No matter his age.|J. N. 's a father.
00:15:44:and he's not about|to let down his son.
00:16:00:By any standard. J. N. Roberts|is a true motorcycle legend.
00:16:04:50% of a legend is better|than 1 00% of someone like me.
00:16:21:When Jimmy finally got his turn|he took full advantage of it.
00:16:24:getting all the way up|to eighth place overall
00:16:26:and not being passed|for 300 miles.
00:16:31:J. N. 's shoulder was possibly separated.|putting in jeopardy
00:16:34:the plan for him to ride the last 50 miles|to the finish later that night.
00:16:38:In the meantime|there was nothing to do
00:16:40:but sit back and reminisce|about the good ol' days.
00:16:43:A few of the old-time boys|used to come down here and...
00:16:47:But long before it was a race.
00:16:49:Just to see if they could get|from Tijuana down to La Paz.
00:16:53:And just to find|your way was a chore.
00:16:55:You telegraph the time you leave|and you pick up the telegraph
00:16:58:and check in your time|when you get to La Paz.
00:17:01:That's the only way|you could document it.
00:17:03:There wasn't anybody down here with|helicopters flying in those days to follow us.
00:17:08:When promoter Ed Perlman announced|plans for the inaugural Mexican 1000.
00:17:12:race legend Malcolm Smith|immediately thought of two things--
00:17:15:get J. N. Roberts for his partner|and buy a map.
00:17:18:I tried to get him to read|the guidebook so he'd know his way.
00:17:22:He said, "l don't need any guidebook.|I can always find my way."
00:17:25:On the day of the race.|the press was told
00:17:27:the first vehicle would arrive|at San Ignacio. the halfway point.
00:17:31:at around 5 a. m.
00:17:32:Malcolm arrived at 5 p. m..|a full 1 2 hours earlier.
00:17:36:and eight hours ahead|of the next vehicle.
00:17:38:As evening settled in.|J. N. began his journey
00:17:41:guided by a weak front headlight|and a unique sense of direction.
00:17:44:I seen this light and I thought|I was going the right direction,
00:17:49:and it was a star,|and I just kept following it.
00:17:50:I said, "There's a checkpoint.|It's gotta be a checkpoint."
00:17:52:Kept going on. I totally went|to the other side of the coast,
00:17:55:which I shouldn't have went to.
00:17:57:Out of gas. J. N. managed to refuel|at a local fishing village.
00:18:01:He then crossed the entire peninsula|one more time.
00:18:03:where he ran out of gas again.
00:18:05:He had traveled hundreds of miles and|hadn't made an inch towards the finish line.
00:18:09:We found him sleeping under a cactus.
00:18:11:He says, "l don't have a clue|where I am. Can I follow you in?"
00:18:15:I think it took him, I don't know,|14 hours or something.
00:18:18:But he slept six of 'em anyway.
00:18:21:I'll tell you what.|I don't remember half of it.
00:18:23:It was the '60s and '70s, wasn't it?
00:18:25:Yeah, the '60s and '70s|were real good to me.
00:18:28:Despite the nocturnal adventure.|J. N. and Malcolm
00:18:30:would be crowned|the inaugural motorcycle champions.
00:18:33:You know, as you go through life,
00:18:35:if you knew you were making history,|you would've paid more attention to it.
00:18:42:If one man legitimized the Baja 1000.|it was Parnelli Jones.
00:18:45:Winner of the 1963 Indy 500.|his presence.
00:18:49:along with fellow competitors|Steve McQueen and James Garner.
00:18:52:gave birth to the Baja mystique.
00:18:54:And over the years. everyone|seems to have raced the Baja.
00:18:57:But there's one notable exception|who's never managed to make it until now--
00:19:01:the greatest race car driver ever.|Mario Andretti.
00:19:04:Great opportunity,
00:19:05:and so happy that I did it|because I got some taste of it.
00:19:09:Sal Fish invited Mario to be|this year's grand marshal.
00:19:12:His mere presence can make|grown men act like schoolchildren.
00:19:15:Mario Andretti could've been|anywhere in the world,
00:19:18:and he was in Ensenada|at the Score Baja 1 000.
00:19:21:That, to me, I'll never forget that.|It was a highlight of my career.
00:19:24:Say the name Andretti, and that's speed,|that's auto racing. That's it.
00:19:28:And it's global.|It's a universal word.
00:19:31:He's the best.|I love that guy.
00:19:34:I gotta get the car heated up and my seat|buffed 'cause Mario's coming.
00:19:37:He's gonna sit right there.
00:19:38:For Todd. this culminated|years of hero worship.
00:19:41:a chance to bond with his idol.
00:19:43:Mario's, I think, taken the bait.
00:19:46:He's thinking,|"You know, I can do this."
00:19:49:I want you to drive it slowly,|and I'm gonna sit there--
00:19:52:Yeah, sure.
00:19:53:He took the wheel before|Todd could cry for help.
00:19:58:There's a very good reason the name|Andretti is synonymous with speed...
00:20:04:Because it's synonymous with speed.
00:20:08:Feeling the pre-run truck here,
00:20:10:I could see how you could|all of a sudden find yourself in a ditch
00:20:13:upside down really easy.
00:20:16:All of a sudden he's|pushing the thing pretty hard,
00:20:19:we're on the right-hand side,|stuff's going right by me.
00:20:22:So I said, "Hey, Mario, you gotta slow down.|I think there's some horses coming up."
00:20:25:There weren't horses coming up,|but anything to get this thing slowed down.
00:20:38:What did you think of that?
00:20:40:What did you think of that?|I loved it.
00:20:43:Todd's hyperventilating had stopped.
00:20:46:Unfortunately. so did his truck.|20 miles from civilization.
00:20:51:It's died.|We've got no battery.
00:20:55:Didn't go fast enough.
00:20:58:You didn't go fast enough|to charge the battery.
00:21:03:Eventually a ride pulled up.
00:21:05:The lady in the truck|obviously didn't follow racing.
00:21:08:but she knew a good head|for hats when she saw one.
00:21:13:I'm sorry to do this to you, but...
00:21:16:The husband. on the other hand.|knew instantly
00:21:18:that the man carrying his|dirty laundry was a living legend.
00:21:22:- Chris and Sam, you're my saviors.|- Mario Andretti, it's a pleasure to meet you.
00:21:25:I've heard of you|for years and years.
00:21:29:The couple happily drove|20 miles out of their way.
00:21:31:compensated with a mere autograph.
00:21:34:Pure Baja magic.
00:21:35:Everything goes wrong|and then works out perfectly.
00:21:38:See, you turned out to be|the highlight of our day.
00:21:41:Well, you're the highlight of ours, too.
00:21:43:Mario couldn't get over the potential|in off-road racing.
00:21:48:It's incredible, you know,|what has been developed.
00:21:52:But I keep saying, I mean,|the imagination is the only limit.
00:22:00:These are for the rock stars|of the Baja. the unlimited classes.
00:22:04:the big-money race teams that use|choppers for chase vehicles.
00:22:07:It's the most dynamic thing you can do.|You have everything you want.
00:22:10:You have 800 horsepower,|you've got three feet of suspension,
00:22:13:you got a chromoly cage,|you got a breathing apparatus,
00:22:17:you got a co-rider telling you|you need to do these different things.
00:22:19:If you could look under "macho"|in the dictionary, there'd be a trophy truck.
00:22:24:The racer most identified|with the Baja 1000
00:22:27:is NASCAR driver|Robby Gordon.
00:22:28:I mean, this is his world.
00:22:30:It isn't in NASCAR.|This is where he's the king.
00:22:34:And you can see everybody|defer to him here.
00:22:37:Robby was just a kid|when I took him for a ride
00:22:40:out in Saddleback|in one of the blazers,
00:22:42:and I can remember seeing|his helmet up here.
00:22:44:You know, he just loved it.
00:22:46:Robby became|Baja's boy wonder.
00:22:48:He's gone on to make millions racing|from Daytona to Indy.
00:22:51:but he never forgets his roots.
00:22:53:I left home on Sunday night,|we flew out in a helicopter,
00:22:55:got on a commercial airline,|and flew to L.A.
00:22:57:Left at 5 a.m. to come down here.|We pre-ran Monday and Tuesday.
00:23:00:Did the whole course in two days.
00:23:01:He was a little cocky and, you know,|it probably hurt him in a lot of ways.
00:23:05:I know where everybody's at.
00:23:06:I'm gonna watch every car|go by the wayside.
00:23:08:The car's good enough
00:23:09:that at 75%, it's as fast|as everybody else.
00:23:12:You know, a lot|of good race drivers are cocky.
00:23:14:Numbers are drawn for starting position.|Robby got the last spot.
00:23:20:While starting at the very front of|the line was Hawaiian Alan Pflueger
00:23:23:in his very first race in a trophy truck.
00:23:25:You can't really describe it.|You've gotta experience it.
00:23:28:And it's awesome.|It's a controlled explosion.
00:23:32:It's like trying to hold a piece of dynamite,|keep the explosion in your hand.
00:24:19:It's driving that fine line where|you get off that line, it gets hairy.
00:24:23:It gets really hairy.
00:24:25:But it's fun.|It's fun on that line.
00:24:57:You need binoculars to drive|'cause you don't look at the bumps.
00:25:01:You just look at, you know,|like an aurora
00:25:03:that you might come off this side|and hit the other side.
00:25:23:You've got the ability to go so fast.
00:25:26:But the challenge is to be smart enough|to go slow enough to finish the race.
00:25:30:'Cause any dummy can go out there|and put their foot down and go fast.
00:25:33:But you gotta know when to lift|and put that brake on.
00:25:36:The highways are open|to all traffic during the race.
00:25:39:Matter of fact. all the roads are.
00:25:40:They have things like speed limits.|but since it's a race
00:25:43:and boys will be boys.|most ignore 'em.
00:25:45:After all. who's gonna catch 'em?
00:25:51:I wasn't speeding.
00:25:52:Well. the authorities were slightly miffed.
00:25:54:But Pflueger immediately|saw the error of his ways
00:25:56:and turned state evidence|and was deputized.
00:26:04:When we were listening on the radio|to where the cars were,
00:26:06:I hear there's a bunch of cops have|pulled over all the heroes in the sport
00:26:10:and they're on the side of the road|having a doughnut convention.
00:26:13:And just like that.|two of Baja's finest
00:26:16:stopped 70 people|and $50 million of race equipment.
00:26:20:Meanwhile behind them. the open-wheeled|brother to the trophy truck.
00:26:23:the Class 1 buggies.|surged off the line.
00:26:26:These vehicles are unlimited.|meaning the engine size is unlimited
00:26:30:and so is the budget.
00:26:31:Ranging between $300.000|and $ 1 million.
00:26:35:these are expensive cars.
00:26:36:If you win. four grand maybe.
00:27:04:Behind the big money|of the Class 1 buggies is a lot of heart.
00:27:08:a quality best exemplified|by an off-road racing dynasty.
00:27:11:the McMillin family.
00:27:13:My dad and brother decided they were|gonna race one race in 1 976
00:27:18:for the Baja 1 000, just race it once,|and then sell the car.
00:27:21:Just to say they did it, you know?
00:27:24:And when I was in that Class 9|with eight inches of wheel travel,
00:27:28:a 50-horsepower motor, I really|thought I was gonna win overall.
00:27:32:I mean, I thought,|"l got a chance here."
00:27:36:At 74. Corky McMillin is still|chasing his dream.
00:27:40:You know, people ask me today,|with my age and everything---
00:27:42:I said, "Well, the only person|I really have to please is myself."
00:27:46:And if I feel like I'm competing|and doing good and hanging in there,
00:27:51:I'm happy, I'm satisfied.
00:27:53:The McMillins are a successful family|in more ways than one.
00:27:56:And I see Corky still line up to get|a shower in the morning before the race
00:28:02:in a line at a campground behind|all the guys that work in his company.
00:28:06:And you can't tell which one's Corky|and which one's driving nails the next day.
00:28:09:It makes us all have something|in common to kind of get together with,
00:28:14:and it's not the bosses|and the employees.
00:28:17:I mean, we're all just a bunch of people
00:28:19:trying to have fun and enjoy life,|and we're doing it.
00:28:22:He's had to miss a couple because|of health reasons, but you know what?
00:28:25:Take one race at a time,|and the next race he was back.
00:28:27:My body thinks|my brain's gone crazy.
00:28:32:The McMillin with|the most championships is Mark.
00:28:35:He's also one of the most successful|drivers in the history of the Baja 1 000.
00:28:39:but it's been 1 4 years|since his last victory.
00:28:41:There's ups and there's downs.
00:28:43:But something that I've always taken from|my dad and I'm trying to give to my boys
00:28:48:is you never, never, never give up.
00:28:51:Whether it's at work,|whether it's racing,
00:28:54:or something you're trying to accomplish|at home with your family,
00:28:56:we just never, ever, ever give up.
00:29:00:Mark McMillin got off to a fantastic start.|roaring through the first 80 miles.
00:29:05:But once again. bad luck struck.
00:29:07:At Ojos Negros he'd have to change|his entire transmission.
00:29:11:Way too early. Way too early.
00:29:14:It'll be a long day. We'll get a finish|out of it, that's for sure.
00:29:18:And off the line in Scott McMillin's|buggy was a rookie driver.
00:29:21:his 16-year-old son Andy.
00:29:23:Ever since like I was two or three years old,|I used to go pre-running with my dad.
00:29:27:I started driving a clutch when I was|probably six or seven years old.
00:29:30:I had a lot of trust in him as we, you know,|developed our relationship driving
00:29:35:and just taught him|what I learned from my dad.
00:29:37:At first Andy had|a little problem staying on course.
00:29:42:Watch it. Remember. there's|a hole here. Remember? Stop.
00:29:47:Here. go this way. Stop!
00:29:50:I think about it,|and I think when I have a kid,
00:29:53:I'm never gonna have like|the trust that he has in me.
00:29:55:Now take your time.|Take your time doing it.
00:29:57:But he settled down.
00:30:01:Go. You're running|with the big dogs. boy.
00:30:06:The trust that Scott had in his son|was well deserved.
00:30:08:After a couple of wild rides early.|Andy had gotten it together
00:30:12:and was in first place in his class|when he turned it over to his father.
00:30:19:Probably hit him a little too hard. bud.
00:30:21:You got it. you got it.|Make some dust. Good man.
00:30:28:While the McMillins have fun|on the cutting edge of technology.
00:30:31:there are those who enjoy something|slightly more antiquated.
00:30:40:This is Class 1 1. which gives a whole|new definition to the word "underdog. "
00:30:44:You really get the satisfaction of talking|to someone that races a trophy truck,
00:30:48:a Class 1 motorcycle,|looking at you and saying,
00:30:51:"Oh, you race Class 1 1.
00:30:52:Guy, you must be crazy."
00:30:55:Hey, those guys are|the toughest guys out there.
00:30:58:You know, they've got|little support, you know,
00:31:01:vehicles that are extremely challenged,|and they go for it.
00:31:04:That's the hardcore|Baja racer right there.
00:31:09:These are unmodified|Volkswagen Beetles.
00:31:11:Not the New Beetle.|but the old Beetle. pre- 1982.
00:31:15:No modification of the suspension|or engine is allowed.
00:31:18:We are losing our dashboard.
00:31:28:What they lack in speed|they more than make up for in passion.
00:31:32:It's a feeling inside of this one.
00:31:36:We born know Bajas,|and we die knowing Bajas, too.
00:31:41:I think they're real men.|I mean, there's some stuff
00:31:43:that I have no idea|how they get through.
00:31:46:Racing Class 1 1, it's very,|very important to finish the race.
00:31:53:Sometimes there are no signs left.
00:31:56:Our time limit is sometimes|very, very narrow for us.
00:32:01:So it's very significant to go through
00:32:04:whatever you have to|go through in getting there,
00:32:08:just getting there.
00:32:10:Stand by. He's on his way.|Air clear.
00:32:14:Looks like we're going right.
00:32:16:By noon everyone|had left the starting line
00:32:19:and racers began|to settle into their groove.
00:32:22:which isn't always a good thing.
00:32:29:Well, that's the end of our race.
00:32:31:Isn't that a shame?
00:32:33:Yeah, that sucks, man.
00:32:35:That rock is what got me.
00:32:38:Just the average person|who has a 9-to-5 job
00:32:40:has 10,000 close calls|over the course of a life.
00:32:42:It's the light|that you run through.
00:32:44:Go through an intersection|and that split second later
00:32:46:somebody runs a red light and goes|behind you, you never even saw it.
00:32:49:Down here you're doing like|all 10,000 in one day.
00:32:53:I think when you get back home,|after you do something like that,
00:32:55:it's like slo-mo, life is slo-mo.|Everything else, that's no big deal.
00:32:58:You got a job interview|or you're showing up for something big,
00:33:01:well, what's the worst thing|that could happen?
00:33:03:Somebody says no,|you know, to a sales job?
00:33:05:Well, I just almost got killed 40 times.|So not really that big of a deal.
00:33:10:It's key to deal with adversity.
00:33:12:Al Hogan uprighted his truck|and was back in the race.
00:33:14:We know it was gonna roll over.|It don't seem to phase this one.
00:33:19:This truck likes it, I guess.
00:33:22:Rides better now than it did before.
00:33:24:Getting them shocks broke in|from rolling it over.
00:33:27:Yeah.
00:33:30:What was that all about?
00:33:32:I don't know. Good thing|there wasn't a rock there, though.
00:33:36:Mike, I'm telling you, the back end|is just softer. It's just too soft.
00:33:40:The good Baja racer|is prepared for anything.
00:33:43:Like number 560. who did a complete|roll just outside of Ensenada.
00:33:47:Unphased. he straightened|the windshield wipers out
00:33:50:and his daughter. who knew a thing or two|about twist ties. got the door shut.
00:33:53:And believe it or not. he finished|the race 835 miles later.
00:33:57:twist tie in place.
00:33:59:Then you have the example|of Team Hibachi.
00:34:02:who opted for an impromptu|pit stop to demonstrate
00:34:04:two very distinct methods|of firefighting--
00:34:07:the hyperkinetic smother method|which got the flames 60% contained.
00:34:11:and the much more laid-back|low-altitude water drop.
00:34:17:But there are those|who are just not prepared.
00:34:19:Iike this fella.|who lost his gas cap.
00:34:21:And the fire, it was about this wide|when I looked back.
00:34:24:You got a gas cap?
00:34:26:We got something we could|probably set up for ya.
00:34:31:Look at that fit.|That'll work.
00:34:34:You got some tools|that are salvageable in here.
00:34:36:You don't see help like this every day.
00:34:37:You need a flashlight?
00:34:38:Jason, I think you're|gonna be okay, my friend.
00:34:41:We're pretty sure he made it.|despite some evidence to the contrary.
00:34:45:There are things that are|impossible to prepare for.
00:34:48:Iike your engine falling off.|sitting there. mocking you.
00:34:53:Near the ostrich ranch.|1 5-year-old Kevin Denault was prepared.
00:34:57:his video camera at the ready to shoot|his Uncle Bob as he raced past.
00:35:09:The ostriches were in shock.|Even cars fly better than they do.
00:35:14:It turned out that young Denault|had the only footage of his uncle's wreck.
00:35:17:which had taken place|right in front of him
00:35:19:at the only place their paths|would cross for a thousand miles.
00:35:22:What are the odds?
00:35:24:Probably about the same|as being eaten by an ostrich.
00:35:31:The buggy wasn 't prepared to stop|in the middle of the road.
00:35:34:And the Volkswagen wasn 't prepared|for such little room.
00:35:38:Neither were prepared that the buggy|would start from the bumpers touching
00:35:42:and that the Volkswagen wouldn 't start.
00:35:45:Then a good Samaritan came along.
00:35:47:waved along the truck.|which got its fender ripped off...
00:35:51:... thus starting the Volkswagen.
00:35:53:A pattern had begun to develop.
00:36:02:There's one element that is more|feared and loathed than any other--
00:36:06:silt.
00:36:08:Silt is bottomless talcum powder.
00:36:11:When you get home,|the silt still comes out
00:36:13:of your eyes and your nostrils|for two and three days later.
00:36:17:You can't fathom
00:36:18:what Baja is until you've experienced it.
00:36:20:Explaining silt to someone,|that you hit it and you can't see anything
00:36:24:and you have|to keep your foot down.
00:36:25:I thought I had it all figured out.
00:36:27:The first time I hit silt,|I was going, "Oh, my--"
00:36:30:Don't let off the gas.|Whatever you do, do not let off the gas.
00:37:00:In Baja. everyone agrees|about two things--
00:37:03:silt sucks. and you should|never question authority.
00:37:08:The civility displayed by the racers|during the trophy truck debacle
00:37:12:had convinced the police|to let them off with a stern warning
00:37:14:and an escort off the highway.
00:37:17:Now. for some reason.|Mark Post decided
00:37:19:starting second|wasn 't asking too much.
00:37:22:Mark Miller. already in second.|wasn 't buying it.
00:37:25:So Post decided to settle|for starting third.
00:37:29:Third place Herbst was indignant.|A feud had begun.
00:37:34:Ironically. the roadblock|and police escort
00:37:37:had erased the 30-second gaps|used at the start of the race.
00:37:39:which meant a concern|for safety would spawn
00:37:41:a 20. 000-horsepower free-for-all.
00:38:04:Nice, very nice.
00:38:07:Alan Pflueger. who had already|been crowned the season champ
00:38:09:in the protruck class.|was making his debut in a trophy truck
00:38:13:and shocking everyone.|He was running away with it.
00:38:16:Go, go, go, Pflueger, go!.
00:38:18:Running second through Valle de Trinidad|was Mark Miller and Ryan Arceiro.
00:38:24:Mark Post had been knocked back|to sixth place by vengeful Herbst.
00:38:28:but not for long.
00:38:29:He was roaring back.|hellbent on getting even.
00:38:32:Bouncing past Dan Smith.|terrible Herbst lies ahead.
00:38:54:They hit Valle de Trinidad like something|out of the Book of Revelations.
00:38:58:through the center of town|side by side at over 1 00 miles an hour.
00:39:13:Amazingly. no one was hurt.
00:39:15:Just some metal got bent--|the racer's calling card.
00:39:18:The only way people know in|off-road racing that a car's behind you,
00:39:22:you come up and give 'em|a little bump in the back
00:39:23:and they kind of move over 'cause they|know a faster vehicle's behind 'em.
00:39:26:If they don't move out of the way,|take 'em for a ride.
00:39:28:You don't know fear until you look|in the rearview and see Robby Gordon.
00:39:32:Got Ken on your tail.|He's catching up to you pretty quick here.
00:39:38:Everything that could've|gone wrong went wrong.
00:39:44:It's not a pit stop.
00:39:46:Got one crazy mad driver right there.
00:39:52:Robby had gotten a flat|but his pit crew was unprepared.
00:39:55:putting Robby in full tilt.
00:39:57:He blazed through 30 miles on a flat tire
00:39:59:to nearly be in first place|before finally getting a change.
00:40:07:While the trophy trucks|and Class 1 buggies
00:40:09:represent the power and glamour|of the Baja 1 000.
00:40:12:the true symbol of victory|is the motorcycle.
00:40:14:specifically a motorcycle ridden by|Johnny Campbell and Steve Hengeveld.
00:40:19:With six straight overall titles.|Johnny and Steve stand atop a mountain
00:40:22:with seemingly|nowhere to go but down.
00:40:25:The pressure of winning is always there.
00:40:28:And when you win|several times in a row,
00:40:31:not only do you wanna|do it again for yourself,
00:40:33:but, you know, when you got a corporate|company like Honda, let's say,
00:40:37:for Johnny and Steve, they want|them to win, and they know that.
00:40:40:You don't see it the way you used|to see it when you used to look up.
00:40:44:You know you've conquered it,|you've won it,
00:40:46:and you just wanna win another one.
00:40:49:You expect it. You just expect it.
00:40:52:Anything less is unacceptable.
00:40:55:To beat the elements,|to have the equipment stay together,
00:40:59:there's really a lot|of things against ya.
00:41:01:I mean, I've bounced off|of front ends of cars,
00:41:04:I've bounced off of fences,|I've bounced off of cattle.
00:41:07:You know, it's a little bit|like Russian roulette.
00:41:10:After he won his tenth|Baja 1000.
00:41:12:Larry Roeseler decided to stop competing|for the overall title on a motorcycle.
00:41:16:He felt his time was due.
00:41:19:The next year. Danny Hamel.|starting in Roeseler's traditional spot.
00:41:22:would have his fatal accident.
00:41:26:There is certain risks you take.
00:41:28:You can't live in a box,|or you're just gonna run from everything.
00:41:32:"How do you let him do what he does?"
00:41:34:And I said, "One, we make our living at it.|Number two is,
00:41:36:"the day I tell him that he can't,|he's gonna die in a car accident
00:41:39:going up the 405|to Torrance, you know?"
00:41:41:I mean, when it's your day,|it's your day.
00:41:43:He's expecting Honda 1-X.
00:41:46:Like everything else in Baja.|communication is difficult.
00:41:49:It can take a while to hear bad news.
00:41:51:We need a new front axle|and a new front wheel. Do you copy?
00:41:55:I copy, a new front axle|and a new front wheel.
00:41:59:That's affirmative. He had a problem|early on and clipped a big boulder
00:42:03:and had to change a front wheel|once already but the axle's tweaked
00:42:06:and this wheel's wobbly. so he'll need to.|just like you say. make it right.
00:42:12:Johnny had dislocated his thumb.
00:42:14:and all he wanted to do was turn the bike|over to Steve and assess the damage.
00:42:35:Only two minutes behind came|Chris Blaze of the Honda B Team.
00:42:41:For the first time in years.|Johnny's lead was tenuous.
00:42:44:He'd tape his hand|and be ready for the next leg.
00:42:52:Unfortunately there are accidents|that require more than gauze and tape.
00:42:56:That's when it's time for the Weatherman.
00:42:58:From a repeater station|atop Mount Diablo.
00:43:00:Bob Steinberger is the eyes|and ears of the race.
00:43:02:Score Ops, copy Weatherman.|I have an emergency.
00:43:07:Advise the hospital|that we need immediate...
00:43:09:For over three decades.|Steinberger's been head of communications
00:43:12:for the 1 000. a job he does for free.
00:43:15:In the early '70s|he was doing relays,
00:43:18:and he was putting up|an antenna with weather balloons
00:43:20:and someone called him|the Weatherman, and it stuck.
00:43:22:You know, my dad's 65 years old.|He climbs to the top of this 50-foot tower
00:43:26:on top of an 1 1,000-foot peak|and puts this antenna up,
00:43:30:and right over it's like|a 5,000-foot drop down a sheer mountain.
00:43:33:It's crazy. I mean, he's a great guy|and he loves this sport.
00:43:37:We have an injured driver|at race mile 55.
00:43:41:Weatherman. Score helicopter.
00:43:42:Okay. we have|two injuries. two back injuries.
00:43:45:We are transporting|the first one right now to Ensenada.
00:43:49:Weatherman. could you contact|operations. advise the hospital?
00:43:53:We have a spectator hit|by motorcycle. no pulse.
00:43:56:So we need immediate transfer.
00:43:57:I heard somebody saying they|had a spectator with no pulse.
00:44:02:I have no comeback on that yet.
00:44:04:Weatherman, that's affirmative.
00:44:07:26. 9. spectator hit|by motorcycle. no pulse.
00:44:12:Okay, this is an emergency.|Stand by, everybody.
00:44:16:Spectator hit by a motorcycle|at 26.9, no pulse.
00:44:24:Rescue One. Rescue One.|do you copy?
00:44:26:Helicopter 0-830.
00:44:29:ETA approximately|17 minutes. 1-7 minutes.
00:44:33:Score helicopter, copy Weatherman.
00:44:36:We copy. Weatherman.|We'll be on our way there.
00:44:39:It's gonna be...
00:44:41:Boy. it's gonna be an ETA|of probably about 20 minutes or so.
00:44:49:Weatherman.
00:44:54:I don't know what to do at this time.
00:45:08:The spectator that died|wasn't hit by anyone in the race
00:45:10:or any vehicle in the race.|but by another spectator
00:45:13:on a motorcycle going|the wrong way on the course.
00:45:16:My biggest fear|is not me tearing up the truck,
00:45:18:me getting hurt,|it's me killing some kid,
00:45:22:me swapping out|and going into the group of people
00:45:24:or some guy pulling a truck out|and I bounce off of him
00:45:27:and kill these people|that weren't doing anything.
00:45:29:But why quit what you love|for a situation?
00:45:32:You don't quit driving on the road because|somebody gets in a car accident and dies.
00:45:36:I mean, I'm not gonna stop flying|because of 9/1 1.
00:45:38:Do I feel anguish for it? Yeah.
00:45:40:I don't ever want that,|or want that for anybody.
00:45:43:But I can't stop my life because of it.
00:45:46:They don't understand.|I don't understand.
00:45:48:I just do it. I just do it.
00:45:51:The Weatherman knows death|is neither fair norjust.
00:45:54:and there's nothing to do|but to go back to work.
00:45:57:I was concerned|that he had checked out.
00:45:59:to make sure he's all right|or are there other problems.
00:46:01:Everything will be fine.
00:46:03:Great. Brian passes along|a thank-you to you.
00:46:08:Fortunately there would be|no more fatalities.
00:46:13:Jetboat. Greg Tracy. Mace.|and his son Chad were on a mission.
00:46:16:They wanted to get|to Race Mile 205 and set up pits
00:46:19:in plenty of time for Mouse.|who was now in third place.
00:46:28:- Do I hear a bike?|- I hear a bike.
00:46:30:No, I hear a tractor.
00:46:39:Ricky Johnson. slated to race|that night in a protruck.
00:46:42:stopped on by|to see if he could help.
00:46:44:- He's a mile and a half out.|- Coming up on five--
00:46:47:Coming up on five minutes.|So we got two more minutes to sweat.
00:46:52:Senior McCoy seemed nervous.|although he denied it at every turn.
00:46:57:That's a good look, Greg.
00:47:00:He's trying to go for that whole retro,|"I'm chillin', I'm not nervous" look.
00:47:04:And the E.M.|Erin's man.
00:47:08:But they know nothing other than|a married man would ever wear that.
00:47:12:Could mean every chick's man.|Don't put that in the film.
00:47:18:- That's him.|- That's it, that's it.
00:47:26:Ricky Johnson decided to pitch in|and give Jetboat a hand.
00:47:30:As I'm doing the tire change,|he's in my ear going,
00:47:32:"Slower's faster, slower's faster."
00:47:34:And that just gave me chills.
00:47:36:A seven-time national champion,|a hero, a god to a lot of people,
00:47:39:is helping me do a tire change.
00:47:41:- They didn't?|- No, you're 1 3 miles up to the Honda pit.
00:47:45:I feel good, bro.|I'm having fun.
00:47:48:"Relax. You got|a thousand miles to go ride.
00:47:51:You need to just relax and chill."|"No, I'm good, I'm good."
00:47:54:"Don't try to win this."|"I'm not. I'm not."
00:47:56:See you guys at 31 9.
00:47:57:You know, he's giving me|the answer that I wanna hear.
00:48:01:I watched him take off.|You know, I say a prayer.
00:48:04:You know, we go down to Mexico|as a band of brothers.
00:48:09:The Baja is a family affair passed down|from one generation to another.
00:48:13:My dad always talked about|Baja 1 000, Baja this, Baja that.
00:48:17:"Wow, that'd be neat, you know?"
00:48:19:You know, I had a real tight family|and we rode motorcycles, we surfed.
00:48:23:My father suddenly passed|when I was 16,
00:48:27:at a point in time where a boy
00:48:28:kind of needs|some direction and stuff.
00:48:31:And my mom was there|and she saw that
00:48:33:we wanted to race,|and so she supported us.
00:48:36:Before, it was Honda, factory.
00:48:37:And so we used to|run it up and down,
00:48:39:do all the pits ourselves.|So it was fun.
00:48:43:In Mexico.|Johnny Campbell is the hero.
00:48:45:Even more than|the charismatic Robby Gordon.
00:48:47:it's Campbell's posters that can be found|from Tijuana to Cabo San Lucas.
00:48:52:He takes this responsibility|seriously as he's very aware
00:48:55:of the impact his heroes had|on him as a kid.
00:48:59:You are his idol.
00:49:00:Yeah?
00:49:05:You know, sometimes you just gotta|step out of the element for a little bit,
00:49:08:think about what's really going on.
00:49:13:So, you know, I thought the best thing|I could do is just give the kid a jersey.
00:49:20:It's not a replica or something|that can be bought in a store.
00:49:23:It's the real thing.|a Johnny Campbell race jersey.
00:49:26:Johnny Campbell's a good man.|His father would be proud.
00:49:30:His mother is.
00:49:33:Women in general have|had a big impact in Baja.
00:49:36:including this year. with the BC- 1 0.|an all-woman team
00:49:40:comprised of the wives|and daughters of other racers.
00:49:43:We were kind of|on the sidelines last year,
00:49:47:and all the guys|were out there racing.
00:49:50:And we kind of all looked|at each other and we're like,
00:49:55:"Why are we standing here?|Why aren't we out there racing?"
00:49:58:My sister raced,|my mother raced.
00:49:59:They had enough girls at that time
00:50:01:where they raced a class|that was called powder puff.
00:50:03:And they would race|after the guys raced
00:50:06:in whatever cars were left over,|and go out and race each other.
00:50:10:By the time I came along,|they just didn't have that anymore,
00:50:13:and I was determined|I was gonna race.
00:50:15:And here I am, still racing.
00:50:18:All of us know that we have to get|the car to the next one.
00:50:22:And, you know, to finish first,|you have to first finish.
00:50:25:I think also women have this image|of not being good drivers.
00:50:29:But we always|tell people on the tours
00:50:31:that the women tend to do|better than the men
00:50:33:because we don't have|quite that ego behind us,
00:50:36:- like something to prove.|- Exactly.
00:50:37:Women will ask for directions.
00:50:42:A lot of times you're|taken as a joke
00:50:44:until you go out and show|that you're not a joke.
00:50:46:You know, you're taken very lightly.
00:50:48:Call BCA|and tell them we're on their ass.
00:50:53:- I'll hit 'em when I have to.|- Okay.
00:50:58:The horn was my job. As soon|as we were getting close to someone,
00:51:02:that was my job, to hit the horn,
00:51:04:warn 'em,|and Bekki sure rammed 'em.
00:51:08:Okay.
00:51:09:- I think they must know I'm here.|- Oh, yeah.
00:51:12:We all have someone that we're|competing against that we're related to.
00:51:16:And I think that's pretty uncommon,
00:51:18:that a family can come together|and support each other
00:51:21:even though they're competing|against one another.
00:51:24:We started off bonding when they|were just that high by skiing together.
00:51:29:But what it really does|is that it makes you friends.
00:51:32:And if you're friends you have respect,|and that makes for a great family.
00:51:36:I've always had that competitive edge
00:51:38:to hopefully beat my husband|out there, so that'd be nice.
00:51:41:Actually having my wife compete|in the event this year
00:51:44:meant more than I ever thought it would.
00:51:46:She's happier, healthier,|she's more just full of herself.
00:51:49:Bob Sutton|putting together the girls' team
00:51:51:happens to be|one of the biggest moves
00:51:53:that I've had|in my little career down here.
00:51:57:Families compete as well as friends.
00:51:59:When the Honda helicopter|informed Steve Hengeveld
00:52:02:that his lead had been cut in half.|Steve didn't even ask why.
00:52:05:He knew his friend Andy Grider|had gotten on the bike.
00:52:10:Andy. Steve. and Johnny|had been teammates the previous year
00:52:13:on the Honda A Team.
00:52:14:He was one of|the defending champs.
00:52:17:It's probably the highest notch|on my wall right now,
00:52:20:besides being a father, you know.
00:52:22:It's right under being a father.
00:52:24:A corporate decision|bumped Andy from the A Team
00:52:26:just two weeks before the race.
00:52:28:He and his father Neil|were headed home
00:52:30:when Chris Blaze asked if he wanted|to race on the Honda B Team.
00:52:33:It's not about the race.
00:52:35:It's about being down here,|having fun, being with your family.
00:52:38:When I say family, I mean|the whole community of off-road racing.
00:52:41:And once I figured it out,|everything started clicking
00:52:44:and the race just went|smooth from there.
00:52:46:It doesn't matter|if you're racing off-road
00:52:49:or playing the piano,|you try, you give your best to life.
00:52:53:And when you have a son that does|that, it brings me to tears sometimes.
00:52:57:I mean, I was so proud of him.
00:52:59:Andy and Neil had a plan--
00:53:01:prove the folly of leaving Andy|off the A Team.
00:53:04:They wanted to lead the race.|not just on time.
00:53:06:but physically. so they|would be making first dust.
00:53:09:Through checkpoint four.|Andy had been reeling Steve in.
00:53:12:The once four-minute lead|had shrank to 30 seconds.
00:53:15:It took me probably 50, 60 miles|for my arms to loosen up.
00:53:18:But in that time I was catching Steve.
00:53:20:I could see the helicopter|getting closer and closer
00:53:22:and then all of a sudden|I was in his dust.
00:53:24:"Okay, just take it easy.|Let the pit strategy get you in the lead
00:53:29:and see what happens after that."
00:53:31:If the rear tire holds.|the impossible can be achieved
00:53:34:and Andy will be at the front|of the entire Baja 1 000 field.
00:53:38:It's 22 on the highway.
00:53:39:There's about a 30-second split|between 1-X and 1 1-X.
00:53:45:Knowing that Andy|had started behind him,
00:53:48:Steve has|no choice except to pin it.
00:53:51:And that's gonna tear his tire up,|which is okay with him
00:53:55:because he knows he's getting|a new tire at this pit.
00:53:57:What he didn't know was that we were|running a different tire compound.
00:54:10:- Front wheel okay, Steve?|- Yeah.
00:54:15:Gas only!. Gas only!.
00:54:17:Gas only!. Gas only!.
00:54:23:Go!.
00:54:33:1 1-X. 1:05:55.|30 seconds apart.
00:54:38:1-X is right behind him.
00:54:42:Andy didn't only wanna take the lead.|he wanted to keep it.
00:54:45:The first place he led|was the last place he wanted to--
00:54:48:the silt beds. where a motorcycle|can be swallowed whole.
00:54:51:He took a center line.|held it wide open. and prayed.
00:55:15:While Andy headed for the coast|as fast as he could go.
00:55:18:Johnny took the perfect line.
00:55:19:He knew where every nook was|and every cranny.
00:55:31:As luck would have it.|one of the few witnesses of this race
00:55:35:was the man who cut Andy|from the Honda A Team.
00:55:37:He's riding in that helicopter.
00:55:43:While the course is marked.|there is sometimes certain creativity.
00:55:46:although you do run the risk|of missing a checkpoint
00:55:49:because the checkpoints|are kept secret.
00:55:52:A lot of racing down here|is doing your homework.
00:55:55:Part of Baja|is a lot of free running.
00:55:57:I had some alternate ways|and lines and stuff,
00:56:00:and if I had to use them I would.
00:56:26:At the top of the screen|is Andy's dust cloud.
00:56:28:For Johnny.|it's like a red cape to a bull.
00:56:41:He's flat out|at 1 10 miles an hour.
00:56:44:One kelp pocket or tide washout.|and his day ends in a heartbeat.
00:57:02:Andy holds his lead.
00:57:21:Miles later. Johnny tries it again.
00:57:40:Coming up on the left-hand|side of the screen.
00:57:42:Andy Grider neck-and-neck|with Johnny Campbell.
00:57:46:Andy holds the lead|and will all the way to the highway.
00:57:50:Today is his day.
00:58:07:By this point in the race.
00:58:09:Andy had battled the 1-X bike|for over 200 miles.
00:58:12:It seemed beyond comprehension.
00:58:15:Neil had set up Andy's pit
00:58:16:1 2 miles down the road|from the Honda A Team.
00:58:22:For Johnny.|this was the end of the race.
00:58:25:Steve would ride|the next 350 miles to the finish.
00:58:27:Get Mark with the oil.
00:58:29:Tell Mark we need oil. Oil.
00:58:34:Andy was finished as well.
00:58:36:Chuck Dempsey would take over the bike.
00:58:38:We're probably gonna need|to patch it at both ends.
00:58:40:Hey, my radio ain't working.|I can't hear Bruce for some reason.
00:58:49:Steve was off.
00:58:50:He had 12 miles of pavement|before he hit new dust.
00:58:58:- Go!.|- Let's go, let's go!.
00:59:00:- Go!.|- Good job, good job.
00:59:03:Make some dust!
00:59:04:Make some dust, buddy!.|Make some dust, Chuck!
00:59:06:Clear it out, clear it out.
00:59:14:Go, go, go!
00:59:37:Steve Hengeveld. the best night racer|in the world. was flat out.
00:59:40:Trying valiantly.|Chuck Dempsey could not close the gap.
00:59:43:But it didn't matter.
00:59:44:Because for an afternoon.
00:59:46:Andy Grider had accomplished|the impossible.
00:59:48:I've had what I would consider|a few moments that I felt greatness
00:59:53:when I raced.
00:59:54:A lot of people, if you ask them--
00:59:55:if you say, "Okay, break it down.|What was your best race?"
00:59:58:And it might not be they won,|but they had a moment
01:00:02:that you're so present|in everything that's happening--
01:00:05:flawless and effortlessly.
01:00:07:And outside is utter chaos,
01:00:09:but that chaos is around 'em,
01:00:12:and they're sitting|in the middle of the tornado,
01:00:13:the eye of the storm.
01:00:15:You make a correction|before a reaction starts.
01:00:19:They're not scared, they're not afraid.
01:00:21:They don't think they can be hurt.
01:00:23:You don't have time to be afraid.|Afraid's afterward.
01:00:26:You know, it's like...
01:00:28:"Man, I just avoided death once again."
01:00:35:A father and his son.
01:00:37:An icon and his legacy.
01:00:39:An epic race witnessed|mostly by cactus.
01:00:41:No TV. no adoring crowds.|just the clarity of the moment.
01:00:45:A clarity that can give a racer a greater|appreciation of place and of people.
01:00:50:An awareness of the give and take.|the golden rule.
01:00:53:For six-time champion|Malcolm Smith.
01:00:55:giving back is more important|than any victory.
01:00:57:One of Malcolm's favorite things to do|is to visit a little community
01:01:01:just outside of Trinidad.
01:01:02:He and his son Alex|bring their bikes and buggies
01:01:04:and give the local kids a thrill.
01:01:07:How can I give back to Baja|some of the enjoyment I've had?
01:01:10:We started donating time|and effort and money
01:01:13:about eight years ago here.
01:01:16:They only had a little bit of one house done|when we first started here.
01:01:20:No, it's really fun.
01:01:22:We come down here every year|and I've been seeing kids here
01:01:25:for eight years now.
01:01:26:And it's kind of nice to come down here|and see 'em over and over again.
01:01:31:Two days after we filmed this.
01:01:32:Malcolm. Alex.|and a dozen of Alex's classmates
01:01:35:poured the foundation for a library|to be built right there on turn four.
01:01:38:The kids truly appreciate the time|and attention the Smiths give them.
01:01:42:Being orphans.|they know it's not always available.
01:01:47:They are all from Mexicali,|Tijuana, Ensenada.
01:01:51:And we have a few|from the local town, Valle de Trinidad.
01:01:56:It brings tears to my eyes
01:01:57:thinking of these kids being abandoned|on the streets of Mexico,
01:02:01:and now to think what they have here|and what opportunities they have here.
01:02:05:To me that's the most important thing|about Malcolm.
01:02:09:He wants to be here.
01:02:10:He wants to feel|what it's to be with our kids
01:02:12:and, you know, spend some times|and, you know, give them some joy,
01:02:17:not only the bunk beds they receive,
01:02:20:not only the water pump they receive,
01:02:23:or all the things they have|because of Malcolm Smith.
01:02:26:I learned lessons from 'em,|like you can never quit down here
01:02:30:'cause if you do,|it's a major problem for you.
01:02:32:You can never quit on any race,
01:02:34:'cause then, I mean, somebody else|might have the same problem you do
01:02:37:and they might quit.
01:02:38:But if you don't quit, you might win.
01:02:48:Among the original Baja racers.|giving back is an unspoken tradition.
01:02:53:Baja has a magic to me.
01:02:55:I can be kind of sick|and have a backache and come down here
01:02:59:and ride my motorcycle and be free,|and I feel better right away.
01:03:04:I mean, the farther you get away|from the civilization
01:03:07:on these really back roads,|the more the magic is.
01:03:14:The back roads of Baja are endless.
01:03:17:And a beauty can be found|in the most unusual places.
01:03:19:Take Coco's Corner.
01:03:21:a kingdom built|from what's been left behind--
01:03:23:old beer cans|and bent motorcycle frames.
01:03:26:the unexplainable.|the bizarre. and the long-forgotten.
01:03:30:This is a place where a man's dream|only needs one leg to kick reality's rear.
01:03:34:Of course.|Coco wouldn't tell you anything like that.
01:03:37:Because for him. this is just his place.
01:03:39:and everybody is invited.
01:03:41:Okay, you can go inside|and camping, please.
01:03:44:Yes, this is free.|I no charge nobody.
01:03:46:Fifteen years ago.|Coco was a valet in Ensenada
01:03:49:when a car accident took his leg.
01:03:51:Soon after. bound to a wheelchair.|his supposed friends took his self-worth.
01:03:55:I wanna stay in Ensenada.|And everybody, he close.
01:04:00:He said, "You too old, you sick."
01:04:04:So that's why I come here.
01:04:06:That's why I open this place|1 3 years, seven...
01:04:11:So. Coco's Corner is|a ticked-off plan B.
01:04:14:Buy a little campground|just outside of nowhere
01:04:16:where the 1000 races past|every now and then.
01:04:18:and in time.|the pre-runners and pit crews stop by.
01:04:21:and Coco has 'em sign this book.
01:04:23:Write or draw.|as long as you make your mark.
01:04:26:Coco has created an off-road oasis.|a kingdom where nothing is disposable.
01:04:29:and the only thing that outnumber|the beer cans are his friends.
01:04:34:- How are you, my friend?|- Good to see you.
01:04:36:Thank you coming back again.
01:04:38:While he's never competed in the race.
01:04:39:Coco embodies the spirit|of the Baja 1000.
01:04:42:Good luck, everybody.
01:04:45:Baja has a wonderful way|of just grabbing ahold of you.
01:04:50:And you're just|lookin' around going, "Wow.
01:04:51:Where's all this coming from?"|You know?
01:04:54:Actually, we have stopped|just to look around.
01:04:58:They battle a peninsula.
01:04:59:a place between the old west|and the twilight zone.
01:05:01:They challenge it|not for money or fame.
01:05:02:but for simple bragging rights.
01:05:24:During the Second World War,
01:05:26:President Roosevelt turned|to the Mexican government
01:05:29:and said, "We want to put guns|along the coastline
01:05:32:"to protect ourselves from the Japanese.
01:05:34:Could we not put a little paved road|down the length of Baja?"
01:05:37:Well, Mexico is neutral,|so they said no.
01:05:40:So that was the end of that.
01:05:41:Just imagine if they'd put|in a paved road the length--
01:05:43:if they had said yes.
01:05:46:Maybe we wouldn't be sitting here.|There wouldn't be any off-road racing.
01:06:07:A little water for ya.
01:06:08:I ain't getting my truck all dirty|and scratched up.
01:06:11:What the hell's wrong|with these people?
01:06:13:They're getting all hot now.
01:06:14:They're getting splashed|all with water on their face.
01:06:44:It's a long. tough day.
01:06:46:Race for an afternoon in the Baja.
01:06:47:and you'll have|a year's worth of stories.
01:06:51:At least. that's the case|for Mike and Robby Groff
01:06:53:and Indy Car champion|Jimmy Vasser.
01:07:00:Vasser has a relationship|with the Groffs
01:07:02:a lot like Larry Fine had|with Moe and Curly Howard.
01:07:05:Twenty-five minutes,|and he said,
01:07:06:"For sure I knew|it was Robby Gordon, you know?"
01:07:10:And when he finally caught|and passed,
01:07:12:it was like a truck full of Mexicans|going, "Go! Go! Go!"
01:07:19:My earliest memory|of the Groff brothers
01:07:22:was in Columbus, Ohio,|at the Grand Nationals in 1974.
01:07:25:At eight years old,|he was already a stud,
01:07:27:and he has this leather racing jacket,
01:07:29:and he has this patch with Wile E. Coyote|holding the Roadrunner by his neck,
01:07:33:and it said "Beep-beep my ass."
01:07:35:And I said, "l gotta know this guy."
01:07:38:And here we are.
01:07:40:Last year's 1000|was their debut as a team.
01:07:42:A series of problems led to Vasser|getting in the car at sunset
01:07:46:while the light bar was|still a hundred miles away.
01:07:49:And I jumped in the car with no lights,|and the sun was going down,
01:07:53:no moon or nothing.
01:07:55:You know, like a Toyota pickup--|looked like they were inebriated--
01:07:57:were honking their horn at me|trying to go around.
01:07:59:That's how slow I was going.
01:08:01:And I'm in the race, right?
01:08:04:And eventually, we found a stop,
01:08:06:and I borrowed two lights|off of the paraplegic lsraeli team,
01:08:10:I swear to you.
01:08:11:But he said, "I'll give you that one|and that one."
01:08:14:So I got 'em|and I rigged 'em on the front.
01:08:16:I had two lights|to go like a hundred miles,
01:08:18:and with no front brakes, I might add.
01:08:21:I had to have a Lear jet pick me up.|I had to abandon the race.
01:08:24:I had a Lear jet pick me up|in the bay of L.A. on a dirt strip
01:08:28:'cause I had to get back|to this cart banquet.
01:08:30:They wouldn't let me get out of it.
01:08:31:Otherwise, they wasn't gonna|give me the prize money for the season.
01:08:33:It was a nightmare.
01:08:34:I slept in the runway|and in, you know, the desert.
01:08:36:I started reminiscing.
01:08:38:I started looking back,|thinking about it
01:08:39:and started telling stories|to my friends, what happened.
01:08:41:I thought, "l had a great time."|You know?
01:08:44:I finally realized.
01:08:46:Took a couple months|for me to figure it out--I had a great time.
01:08:48:Unfortunately. this 1000 would give|the Groffs and Vasser many more stories.
01:08:53:Electrical problems ended their day|before the sun set.
01:08:56:Others had problems. too.|Iike Mouse McCoy who got a flat tire
01:08:59:and had to ride on it|for 40 miles to get a spare.
01:09:02:Still. he forged ahead. mile after mile.
01:09:06:Eleven hours straight|at that kind of pace--
01:09:09:physically, yeah, it's tough,|but more so mentally.
01:09:12:'Cause you don't wanna make a mistake,|especially at night, you know.
01:09:16:They might find you the next day.
01:09:18:So it just--really,|mentally just wears you down.
01:09:23:- Is that--|-That's him, that's him!
01:09:27:Reaching the halfway point of the race.|Mouse is greeted by Jetboat and crew.
01:09:30:plus Andy and Neil Grider|who waited to see how he was doing.
01:09:34:Hey, you're okay.|You're fine.
01:09:36:I got a flat coming off the beach.
01:09:38:I had to ride for 40-something miles|till I got up to Catavena,
01:09:42:and then I scrounged a wheel|off some dudes.
01:09:44:I'm having a little bit of problems|with my hands, Greg.
01:09:46:Yeah.
01:09:47:They're really like this.|They're locked up, man.
01:09:50:Fresh gloves and goggles|if you want 'em.
01:09:52:Yeah, I need a fresh...
01:09:54:You're not far back.|Eight came through here not long ago.
01:09:56:Who?
01:09:57:Eight, and 449 just passed|a minute ago.
01:10:01:- They did?|- Yeah. A minute ago.
01:10:02:I'll get 'em back.|Hey, I lost like 45 minutes.
01:10:05:I was third overall, back--|gonna pass the guy.
01:10:08:Started what, 16th?|Or something like that.
01:10:10:And I was gonna pass the four--|or third overall.
01:10:14:- I was--|- You'll get 'em in the woods.
01:10:16:- You'll get 'em in the woods.|- I'll get 'em in the woods.
01:10:18:But I'm feelin' it.
01:10:20:You're doing|a huge accomplishment.
01:10:22:Take--keep yourself hydrated|and take it easy.
01:10:24:You're doing great.
01:10:26:I was in third, Neil, almost.
01:10:27:I know. That's okay.|You're doing fine.
01:10:29:- Then that flat, dude.|- You'll get it back.
01:10:30:He's right up there.|Don't worry.
01:10:32:- It's only half over.|- I know.
01:10:35:Mouse remembers|something important to tell Andy.
01:10:37:I had to ride for 40-something miles|till I got up to Catavena,
01:10:41:and then I scrounged a wheel|off some dudes.
01:10:43:I'll get 'em back.|Hey, I lost like 45 minutes.
01:10:46:I was third overall, back--|gonna pass the guy.
01:10:57:He's telling you a story.
01:10:58:He was a click out of delirious.
01:11:00:Bike's running, he's telling you a story.|It was great.
01:11:02:"Wait, I got four more seconds.
01:11:03:I have a great story.|You're gonna love this one."
01:11:07:The pit crews are the backbone|of the Baja 1000--
01:11:09:guys like Jetboat.
01:11:11:I was on lndy Car teams|for years--Arceiro's.
01:11:13:At lndy, changing a tire close to the wall|with a car coming in at 120,
01:11:17:your adrenaline's pumping|for about 1 5 seconds,
01:11:20:and then it leaves, you're done.
01:11:21:This race,|just all the planning and preparation
01:11:24:and wondering where Mouse is at,
01:11:26:your adrenaline's pumping|for about 24 hours.
01:11:29:And it's just the most amazing high|that you can ever be on in your life.
01:11:33:While Jetboat chases Mouse.|others wait for their racers.
01:11:37:These are the pit crews|of the big-money unlimited classes.
01:11:40:Their surroundings are|like a gearhead Xanadu.
01:11:43:and they live like firemen.|ready whenever for whatever.
01:11:46:We may drive by and just wave|and say, "Hey, thanks for being here."
01:11:49:But if we need something, they're there.
01:11:51:You could not be a mechanic|workin' full-time in the racing business
01:11:55:if you didn't love it.
01:11:57:And they just--you know,|it's almost an addiction.
01:12:00:You're coming down here, the truck's|only gonna be here for like 40 seconds.
01:12:04:- Done, and we're done.|- No, we're packing up.
01:12:06:You gotta find something to do.
01:12:08:Drove all this way,|you gotta do something.
01:12:12:Idle hands|can be the devil's playthings.
01:12:16:Oh, my God!
01:12:18:The pit crews are forced|to amuse themselves for hours on end.
01:12:21:As night falls. a full 25%|of the field has dropped out.
01:12:25:and many pit crews'jobs|are just beginning.
01:12:27:But for Jimmy Roberts.|his day is over.
01:12:30:He's gotten his team back|into the top ten.
01:12:31:Get off.|Your work is done.
01:12:34:Good job, bro.
01:12:35:Greg, my dad crashed.
01:12:37:Greg Tracy would take over the bike.
01:12:39:and take it the next 300 miles|into the night.
01:12:41:It's only half over.|And Greg's a hell of a night rider.
01:12:45:If my dad's there,|I'm sure he'll take it in at the end,
01:12:47:but if he's not,|he's gonna have to ride it in.
01:12:49:- Good job, man.|- Yeah.
01:12:51:- Good job, brother.|- Thanks, man.
01:12:52:Give me your helmet.
01:12:54:Jetboat and crew are headed|back to Ensenada with one obstacle.
01:12:57:The first 15 miles of their trek back|was on a live course.
01:13:00:They were going 50 miles an hour|headed north.
01:13:02:while coming at them were trophy trucks|at 1 40 miles an hour.
01:13:06:And their lights are so bright,|you can't see.
01:13:08:And those roads are so tight that|you literally have to just close your eyes.
01:13:11:Jesus.
01:13:13:And it's like a spaceship passing|on the road.
01:13:19:Around dusk. the first automobile|in the race. Alan Pflueger.
01:13:22:pulled into the pits.
01:13:24:His front end was coming off.
01:13:26:They tried welding everything to it--
01:13:27:wrenches. golf clubs.|whatever it would take.
01:13:30:Forty-five long minutes later.|after being passed by five different cars.
01:13:34:Pflueger's day had turned for the worst.
01:13:36:But the Hawaiian kept an even keel|and remained positive.
01:13:41:Down the road.|Robby Gordon pulled into his pits
01:13:44:Iike a tornado|pulling into a trailer park.
01:13:46:His crew looked ready|to run screaming into the night.
01:13:49:but Robby's not the kind of guy|to stand back and whine at people.
01:13:51:He jumps right in there.
01:13:52:busting his knuckles|and shouting at the top of his lungs.
01:13:55:It's the kind of insane intensity|you can't help but admire.
01:14:06:Off went Robby raging into the night.
01:14:09:playing the beast|to the beauty of the all-woman team.
01:14:11:They'd been in first place in their class|until their transmission failed.
01:14:14:Ieaving them stranded in the pits.
01:14:15:Iooking far too clean. too cute.|and too composed.
01:14:18:When do you guys think|you'll be pulling back into Ensenada?
01:14:25:As the night progresses.|things just get weirder.
01:14:28:The crowds don't dwindle but increase.
01:14:31:They come in droves.
01:14:32:The later it gets.|the more people show up.
01:14:34:It's 4:30 in the morning.
01:14:36:We're off in the middle--
01:14:37:We're nowhere near any road,
01:14:38:and people are out there, you know,|with their coolers, their little barbecue,
01:14:42:a little fire going,|cheering you on all night long.
01:14:46:Since elementary school,|our families took us there.
01:14:48:So it's very, very important for us|that people still are waiting for us.
01:14:54:We have a lot of good reactions,|like the Jeep--they make like bets.
01:15:00:Is it gonna make it?|Is it not gonna make it?
01:15:01:And once we get there,
01:15:03:they start like celebrating and stuff,
01:15:05:and they really pump you up,|you keep going.
01:15:09:The Volkswagen is painfully far behind.
01:15:11:which for them is right on schedule.
01:15:15:Meanwhile.|at the other end of the race.
01:15:17:Mouse. amazingly.|was still going strong.
01:15:22:Scott Dunlavey was now|in charge of his pits.
01:15:24:and he brought with him racing legend|Eddie Mulder to surprise Mouse.
01:15:28:Just trying to keep him focused,|you know.
01:15:29:He was very tired at that point.
01:15:30:Got some food in him,|and got some liquids in him.
01:15:35:And, you know,|he's complaining about his hands.
01:15:37:We were third overall,|and I got a flat out on the beach.
01:15:39:I've been trying to gather those guys|back up for a while, man.
01:15:43:I was pretty bummed out,|'cause first of all, 40 miles on a rear flat.
01:15:47:Push it to third overall, man.
01:15:48:You're rockin', dude.|You're rockin'. I know.
01:15:49:I feel strong, but my wrists go numb.
01:15:52:They just lock up.
01:15:53:That's my issue right now.
01:15:55:If I could shake that flat off...
01:15:56:You know, it works your brain over...
01:15:59:I had to slow down.
01:16:01:Hey I lost like 45 minutes.
01:16:04:I was third overall, back--|gonna pass the guy.
01:16:07:Go get 'em, Mouse.
01:16:10:Dunlavey and Mulder will chase Mouse|on his journey to the finish line.
01:16:14:- He's a little wrung out, huh?|- Yeah, he's a little--he's pinging.
01:16:19:On Mount Diablo.|the temperature dropped to freezing
01:16:21:and the wind was blowing|50 miles an hour.
01:16:23:All hell was breaking loose.
01:16:25:The nearby observatory|started to complain
01:16:27:about the light that was leaking|from the Weatherman's tent.
01:16:29:threatening to ruin experiments
01:16:31:that had been going on|for a quarter century.
01:16:34:So the Weatherman put his assistant|on the 30-gallon trash bag duty.
01:16:39:Meanwhile. Robby Gordon 's day|continued to unravel.
01:16:42:Why is Robby stopping here?
01:16:44:Because he ran out of gas|like half a mile back.
01:16:47:We've got one pissed-off driver.
01:16:49:And we're hoping that he stops.
01:16:50:And if he doesn't, we're gonna|have to chase him to the next pit.
01:16:53:It hasn't been a good day.
01:16:59:- Rob, how many you want?|- Tell 'em it's pump gas only.
01:17:01:Tim, it's pump gas only.
01:17:02:No! Get it out.|Don't put that stuff into my car.
01:17:05:- Get out of the way!|- Ready to go.
01:17:07:You got 30 miles left.
01:17:11:Again. Robby disappeared|into the darkness.
01:17:14:joining a long list of things|to be feared in the Baja night.
01:17:17:When you're a little kid,|and the coat rack turns into the monster,
01:17:21:you know there's something|under your bed.
01:17:22:Well, when you're in Baja|and on a motorcycle by yourself,
01:17:26:there is, you know.
01:17:28:You're driving at night|when you see a forest of cactus.
01:17:31:I mean, they're absolutely|just flying by you,
01:17:33:and these things look like they're alive.
01:17:34:They look like|they're talking to you, you know?
01:17:37:I went to go the bathroom,|so I left the car running,
01:17:40:and then my ears|were starting to hurt.
01:17:44:And then I saw like a light.
01:17:46:And I told this kid, "Check out this light.
01:17:48:It's like a flying saucer or something."
01:17:50:"You're full of it."
01:17:51:But it was a real one, you know?
01:17:52:Very close--like a block,|you know, from here.
01:17:54:But he was very, very, very scared.|And I was, too, yeah.
01:17:58:Strange lights can be disconcerting.|No lights can be downright depressing.
01:18:01:That's what happened to Andy McMillin.|with his lead so great.
01:18:04:that when engine problems|slowed him.
01:18:06:he checked the rearview|and didn't see a flicker.
01:18:08:And then they got disoriented out there|and thought maybe that they were lost.
01:18:11:And we got on the radio with him
01:18:13:and said,|"Andy, just put trust into your GPS."
01:18:35:Good job.
01:18:37:Got a left here.
01:18:40:Kind of funky on this side.|All right!
01:18:45:Weatherman. 6-7.|you are breaking up.
01:18:48:Okay. You're the most important|guy on the course right now.
01:18:51:The storm atop Mount Diablo|seemed to engulf the whole peninsula.
01:18:54:the epicenter now located|at the aptly named Zoo Road.
01:19:00:Clear the road!|Get out of the way!
01:19:05:Weatherman. copy.|Just confirmed San Felipe.
01:19:12:Weatherman...
01:19:16:We have a fire that started.
01:19:19:Nobody knows how...
01:19:27:He's onto the right course.
01:19:30:Some people have changed|the course markers. Ieading people astray.
01:19:40:Score. copy. Weatherman.
01:19:41:We are in the helicopter|with a doctor onboard.
01:19:44:I need somebody to respond to me.
01:19:49:When Mouse hit pit 1 1.
01:19:50:he didn 't talk about the usual 40 miles|he'd spent getting another tire
01:19:54:or how he'd been in third place overall.
01:19:55:Instead he had a very specific question.
01:19:57:How far ahead|was the bike in front of him?
01:19:59:That was third place.
01:20:02:I'm gonna get back to my goal,|which was being on the podium.
01:20:05:I really wanted|to get on the podium solo.
01:20:23:He had about 30 miles|up in the mountains,
01:20:25:came back down,|picked up like three spots.
01:20:27:Hauling ass.
01:20:29:I mean, here's a guy|that's blowing bubbles,
01:20:30:and he just picked off two guys|who were fresh.
01:20:34:Through checkpoint 12.
01:20:35:Mouse was only 60 miles away|from the finish line in Ensenada.
01:20:39:He was about to|make the impossible possible.
01:21:13:Broken ribs. slight shoulder separation.|broken finger.
01:21:17:In danger of being run over.|Mouse crawled to the shoulder.
01:21:20:Baja has a way of educating you.
01:21:24:Push that edge that far down there,|and you're done.
01:21:28:It was around 5:00 in the morning|when Robby Gordon.
01:21:31:who'd stayed in the race on sheer fury.|finally had to admit defeat.
01:21:34:If we were to continue down|to the big bumps we were at in San Felipe,
01:21:37:we'd basically break|the back half of the truck off
01:21:39:with it slamming as hard|as it was slamming.
01:21:41:We made a unanimous decision|to load the thing on the trailer,
01:21:43:and that was probably|one of the hardest things to do,
01:21:45:especially all the hard work
01:21:47:that the whole team put|into getting to the Baja 1000.
01:21:50:If you can't win,|you at least wanna finish.
01:21:52:And this year's 1000 we didn't finish.
01:21:55:A driver will often work up to eight hours|to get back in the race.
01:21:59:When he sees the trailer. it's a feeling|of embarrassment and emptiness.
01:22:02:Why do they do it?
01:22:05:It's not 'cause you're crazy|or you got a death wish.
01:22:08:It's competition.
01:22:09:Fighters don't fight to hurt people,|they fight to win.
01:22:12:Racers don't race|because they wanna die.
01:22:15:They wanna go fast.|That's my high.
01:22:17:That's the way I manipulate my life,
01:22:19:is through mechanics|of a machine.
01:22:23:Off-road racing is chasing rainbows.
01:22:25:It's not like lndianapolis|where if you did something,
01:22:28:you'd get something for it.
01:22:29:All you're doing down here is just|endangering yourself for the glory.
01:22:33:When you first start racing, the first thing|you wanna do is to win a race.
01:22:37:Then you wanna win a championship.|Then you wanna win the Baja 1000.
01:22:40:You want all these things.
01:22:42:And then there's gonna be some day when|you're probably gonna win your last race.
01:22:45:Probably five or six miles|from the end I kept thinking,
01:22:48:"Gosh, I wish it would go on."
01:22:50:You know, 'cause I don't want it|to come to an end.
01:22:52:Gimme another mile.|Gimme another half mile.
01:22:54:I want this feeling|just a little bit longer, you know.
01:23:12:By race's end.
01:23:14:27 vehicles will have placed first|in their individual classes.
01:23:17:but only one will be fastest overall.
01:23:19:This is the domain of legends|like Stewart. Roeseler. Smith. and Evans.
01:23:23:And this year's winner belonged|to that company.
01:23:25:Approaching the baseball stadium.
01:23:27:his name being announced|for the seventh year in a row.
01:23:29:with a time of 1 5 hours.|39 minutes. and 52 seconds...
01:23:33:I wanna introduce to you|the motorcycle champion
01:23:37:for the Baja 1 000--
01:23:41:Steve Hengeveld|and Johnny Campbell. Steve.
01:23:44:Until you experience it,
01:23:47:you can't really explain it|'cause it's just so great.
01:23:50:It has so much mystery|and experiences
01:23:53:and the stories we get out of it,
01:23:55:and it's a lifetime of experience,|each and every one.
01:23:58:The second fastest motorcycle|was the Honda B Team
01:24:01:that included Andy Grider.
01:24:04:John Gregory|was fastest on the quad.
01:24:07:The fastest on four wheels|was the Class 1 buggy of Doug Fortin.
01:24:09:while Ryan Arceiro crossed the line|with the quickest trophy truck.
01:24:14:But the most impressive story|on four wheels
01:24:16:was that of 1 6-year-old Andy McMillin.
01:24:18:a high school junior who'd just gotten|his license three months earlier.
01:24:21:Andy finished second in class|and sixth overall--
01:24:25:the most impressive debut|since Robby Gordon 1 8 years earlier.
01:24:28:I'm proud of ya.|You did a great job.
01:24:31:Great job.|Thanks for everything, you guys.
01:24:33:What a great family.|Honor to have you guys with us, it really is.
01:24:37:I had a friend tell me today that in Baja,|if you're dumb, you better be tough.
01:24:43:Having survived 300 miles|with a faulty headlight.
01:24:46:Greg Tracy's arrival|meant J. N. was back on the bike.
01:24:49:Well, if we get third, we'll be good.
01:24:51:Well, whatever we get.|Dude, we had no friggin' lights.
01:24:54:Jimmy didn't need to worry
01:24:56:because his dad had been|within two blocks of the stadium
01:24:58:for quite a while.
01:25:00:He couldn't find the entrance.
01:25:01:When he did make it.|victory towel
01:25:04:wrapped around his neck.|just like the old days.
01:25:06:well. it was 1 967 all over again.
01:25:10:But that's what happened the first time,|so that's only fitting.
01:25:14:Some things are timeless.
01:25:16:There he is standing there,|you know, 30 years later.
01:25:19:He had that smile,
01:25:20:and you could feel the excitement|of there he was, you know,
01:25:23:at the finish line of the 1000.
01:25:24:And gosh, again,|he could be anyplace in the world
01:25:27:and doing anything he wants to do.
01:25:28:And there he is.
01:25:30:You can get|your social security check now.
01:25:33:A little past 5:00 in the morning.|the number 227
01:25:36:of Matt and Steve Scaroni|collected the win in the protruck class.
01:25:40:After a dozen tries.|the father and son team had finally done it.
01:25:43:They give a lot of the credit|to the third driver. Ricky Johnson.
01:25:48:You fall back to the little kid|in the underwear and the six-guns
01:25:52:and the cowboy hat.
01:25:53:You're a cowboy.
01:25:54:At sunrise. two-thirds of those cowboys|were still out in the course.
01:25:58:some as far back as the halfway point.
01:26:00:Iike number 806 of Todd Wyllie|and Mark Julius.
01:26:03:who'd had a rotten night.
01:26:04:They'd lost a transmission.|Iost a front end. simply got lost.
01:26:08:but could not lose|Jethro the know-it-all.
01:26:12:You never finished a 1 00-mile race,|you never finished a 500-mile race.
01:26:16:Come down here, how's he gonna finish|a 1,000-mile race?
01:26:21:Mark Julius. in an attempt|to lose his publicist Jethro.
01:26:24:was off and running.
01:26:25:And then a funny thing happened.
01:26:27:A race broke out for 195th place.
01:26:44:The buggy's race strategy|was hard to figure.
01:26:47:After closing a half-mile gap|in a matter of minutes.
01:26:49:he simply locked onto the rear bumper|and stayed there as if hypnotized.
01:26:54:And the one chance he had|to make a pass.
01:26:56:he saw open air.|and it scared the hell out of him.
01:26:58:He went right back|to his happy place.
01:27:01:After hitting the straightaway.
01:27:03:the buggy couldn't keep pace|with Julius and the truck.
01:27:05:And where it had taken 20 hours|to finish the first half of the race.
01:27:08:it only took him a mere eight hours|to come into the finish.
01:27:12:Julius and Wyllie had done it.
01:27:18:Where's my key?
01:27:20:We made it. We made it.|A thousand miles.
01:27:24:Buddy.
01:27:26:Good job, Mark.
01:27:28:Best adventure of my life.|Thank you, sir.
01:27:30:I couldn't begin to tell ya.
01:27:34:The dreams will come true, man.
01:27:38:Where do we go from here?
01:27:42:Rewarded with a pin.|finishers celebrate all day long.
01:27:45:hour after hour as the clock ticks down|to the 32-hour time limit.
01:27:49:In spite of being denied|a record-breaking 1 0th overall Baja 1 000.
01:27:53:Mark McMillin crossed the finish line|with a big grin on his face.
01:27:57:T old ya I'd make it back for ya.
01:27:59:You did.|You stayed true to your word.
01:28:01:No, we don't give up.|We don't give up.
01:28:04:Proving that even rich|handsome guys don't give up.
01:28:07:Alan Pflueger crossed the line|with a big aloha smile.
01:28:10:It was up front.|It was up front.
01:28:13:See that.|Then the front broke off.
01:28:16:- Hawaiians never quit.|- That's true.
01:28:18:Same hula gal,|or did you replace the hula gal?
01:28:21:No, same hula girl.
01:28:22:Gotta get her a new grass skirt,|but that's all right.
01:28:25:Yeah, I like this one.
01:28:26:Kind of had to do|some testing on this thing.
01:28:28:The ukulele ones last.
01:28:29:The other ones lose their arms,|so it's all good.
01:28:37:Although there are many examples|of Baja's never-say-die spirit.
01:28:41:few have as good a time
01:28:42:as the off-road version|of the Terminator--Al Hogan.
01:28:45:You'll be able to find pieces of his truck|all the way back to the starting line.
01:28:49:Nothing left but his pride|and his sense of the obvious.
01:28:52:Tired, man.
01:28:55:What can you say?|That's Baja.
01:28:57:Sometimes the course wins.
01:28:59:We only got 364 more days|till the next one, right?
01:29:04:One after the other.|they would cross the line.
01:29:06:dusty and tired.|but overjoyed they finished.
01:29:08:As the day wore on.|there were still many on the course.
01:29:11:Amy Thomas searched for the BC- 1 0.
01:29:13:which was still a hundred miles out.
01:29:15:headed for home|in a race against the clock.
01:29:19:And only seconds|behind the women's team
01:29:21:came Eric Solorzano's Volkswagen
01:29:23:bouncing up the goat trail|outside of Trinidad.
01:29:25:hoping to finish.|just to finish.
01:29:28:While the Volkswagen wouldn't make it.
01:29:30:the women's team would.|with ten minutes to spare.
01:29:41:It was Mouse's drive to finish|that had us worried the night before.
01:29:44:We decided to send helmet cameraman|Louis Franco out to find him.
01:29:47:hoping he'd bring him back.
01:29:53:Mouse was up.|but not in the best condition.
01:29:56:Lucky for him.|Jeff Kaplan happened by.
01:29:59:I just saw him|out of my peripheral vision.
01:30:01:He told me that the next place|I could see somebody,
01:30:03:tell 'em that he was stuck there.
01:30:05:And I just told him to follow me in.
01:30:07:But we ended up going fast.|Really fast.
01:30:09:Surprisingly fast for one light.
01:30:12:At speeds|near a hundred miles an hour.
01:30:14:Kaplan paced Mouse for over 20 miles|until finding Scott Dunlavey.
01:30:18:The motorcycle's junk.
01:30:20:I beat the thing into submission|so it was at least halfway rideable.
01:30:23:He's goofy,|he doesn't even know if it's left or right.
01:30:26:He'd hit the wall,|he'd pushed through the wall
01:30:27:and kept going and going|and going and got bit.
01:30:29:And now it was a matter to get back|to some sort of semblance of focus
01:30:34:to get to bring it all the way home.
01:32:07:Mouse McCoy--|18 hours. 2 minutes. 40 seconds.
01:32:11:The sixth motorcycle to finish.|the twelfth overall vehicle.
01:32:15:Not too bad.
01:32:16:There were 246 vehicles behind him.
01:32:21:There's a connection|between people who make a commitment.
01:32:24:a passion shared.
01:32:34:You let me ride side by side|all the way to Ojos, man.
01:32:37:I'll never forget you.|You got me there.
01:32:40:This wasn't just a solo effort.
01:32:41:It might've been a solo effort|as far as me being in the saddle,
01:32:45:but the collective effort
01:32:46:was about my friends and family|carrying me through it,
01:32:49:and that's why it means so much to me,|that we all did it together.
01:32:53:- Congratulations.|- Yeah, congratulations.
01:32:56:Thank you, guys, for letting us|in your country to race here.
01:33:05:Hey, anybody know|where a good taco stand is?
01:33:09:A cold beer?
01:33:10:A cold beer and a taco is what I need.|I haven't eaten much today.
01:33:26:It's a hell of a race.
01:33:28:A race against the clock|in a country that defies time.
01:33:31:in a competition|which forges lifelong friendships.
01:33:35:Maybe only one drives.|but they search for glory as a team.
01:33:38:They look for it in the win.|in the finish. and in the attempt.
01:33:42:because the journey|can justify the destination.
01:33:45:In one word,|the Baja 1 000 for me is...Iove.
01:33:52:It's romantic.
01:33:53:It's awesome.
01:33:55:Tough.
01:33:57:Exciting.
01:33:58:A challenge.
01:34:00:Perseverance.
01:34:01:Tough.
01:34:03:Patience.|A lot of patience.
01:34:06:It's beautiful.
01:34:07:For me, it's just adventure.|I mean, it's such an adventure.
01:34:11:Well, I got a different word,|now that I'm thinking about it.
01:34:12:It's more mystical.
01:34:15:It is mystical.
01:34:16:It has a sense and a spirit of its own.
01:34:19:I think it's just life.
01:34:20:In one day, you kind of get|to experience everything.
01:34:22:You get great things happen|and terrible things happen,
01:34:25:and it's how you deal with 'em|at the end of the night.
01:34:28:It's like life.
01:34:31:A thousand miles and 32 hours|can be a lifetime in a blink.
01:34:35:Do they find glory?
01:34:36:I couldn't say.|because the race never ends.
01:34:39:But if they do. it's in the dust.|and it won't wash away.
01:35:04:What it is, it's like a flying couch.|You know?
01:35:08:That is probably the best way|to explain it.
01:35:12:It's like sitting in your living room.
01:35:14:Yeah, it is a living room|and a flying couch
01:35:16:and just stay out of the big ditches.
01:35:19:My buddy,|here's my buddy Steve Matzinger.
01:35:21:Yeah, baby.|Oh, yeah. Baja!
01:35:25:- He really wants to make the cut.|- I wanna be in the movie!
01:35:28:- He's not gonna be on the movie.|- I wanna be in the big pictures.
01:35:31:Baja!
01:35:33:And as soon as we turned off|the little light on the generator,
01:35:36:we saw the--|thought the floor was moving.
01:35:38:We turned it on,|and it was solid cockroaches.
01:35:40:I was, like, "Oh, my God."
01:35:41:So I ran out to my pack|and got a gallon of gas
01:35:44:and ran a moat around my pack.
01:35:47:And me and Bob, we had to sleep|in the same bed.
01:35:49:I said, "We're probably|gonna get asphyxiated,
01:35:51:but at least we're not gonna get eaten."
01:35:53:And in the morning there was|a bunch of melted cockroaches.
01:35:56:I'm Don.|I'm one of the sound mixers.
01:35:59:Right now we're making up cables,|custom cables for each camera.
01:36:05:We've got one of Don's--|What kind of mike is that?
01:36:09:Active--a 48-volt mike,|which is a supercardioid pattern.
01:36:13:Check, check, check.|Check, check, check one, two.
01:36:16:Check on this side, right,|check on left side.
01:36:19:Check. Check.
01:36:21:When those motorcycles turn on,|it's loud. Loud!
01:36:25:We're yelling right now
01:36:27:because we've got a bunch|of loud motorcycles back here.
01:36:29:So we're just checking the levels,|and see how they're doing.
01:36:32:How's that?
01:36:34:These cameras have a lot of switches|that need to be in the right places,
01:36:36:we discovered.
01:36:37:Right.
01:36:38:What would Scorsese do?|Talk real fast. We know that.
01:36:42:You know, Joe Pesci, he hit|all these guys in the head with a shovel.
01:36:45:Not bad.
01:36:46:Not bad. But where we gonna|get Joe Pesci, let alone a shovel?
01:36:52:Editor...Dana Brown.
01:36:55:He's trying to cover up Matzinger,|which I got it.
01:36:58:I still got--|I can still make out Matzinger.
01:37:05:Do you mind?
01:37:06:With the constant--|the constant paparazzi trip.
01:37:09:Like a candid camera.
01:37:10:You know what you do?|You can fix your hair in this thing.
01:37:14:Hey, there's a camera|behind that big piece of glass.
01:37:18:Dana's crazy. This is the biggest,|craziest movie ever made.
01:37:25:Ever.
01:37:37:Sorry man, I'm just going, "Whoa,|I'm gonna knock that guy on his butt."
01:37:40:I saw.
01:37:41:Yeah, well, you only missed him|by about 12 inches.
01:37:43:Yeah?
01:37:44:What were you shooting,|Herr producer?
01:37:47:We were shooting a little place|called Valle de Trinidad.
01:37:53:- See all that spit fly like that?|- Yeah. Yeah.
01:37:56:That's the effect that I have.
