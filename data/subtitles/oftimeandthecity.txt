1
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,471
Into my heart an air that kills

2
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,712
From yon far country blows

3
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,519
What are those blue
remembered hills

4
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,992
What spires,
what farms are those?

5
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,754
That is the land
of lost content

6
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,718
l see it shining plain

7
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,475
The happy highways
where l went

8
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,030
And cannot come again

9
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,549
l met a traveller from an antique land
who said:

10
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,430
Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert

11
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,115
And on the pedestal
these words appear:

12
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,272
''My name is Ozymandias,
King of Kings:

13
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,513
''Look on my works, ye mighty,
and despair!''

14
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,319
Nothing beside remains

15
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,951
Round the decay of
that colossal wreck, boundless and bare

16
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,036
The lone and level sands
stretch far away

17
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,628
''lf Liverpool did not exist, it would
have to be invented.'' (Myrbach)

18
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,117
We love the place we hate,
then hate the place we love

19
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,111
We leave the place we love,

20
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,034
then spend a lifetime trying to regain it.

21
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,990
Come closer now

22
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,232
and see your dreams.

23
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,349
Come closer now...
and see mine.

24
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,672
No meat on Friday.
Confession on Saturday,

25
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,753
emerging cleansed
and pleasing to God.

26
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,549
Mass on Sundays,
and Holy days of obligation.

27
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,399
Despite my dogged piety,
no great revelation came.

28
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,836
No divine balm
to ease my soul.

29
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,719
Just years wasted in useless prayer.

30
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,792
lf l pray long enough,
l would be forgiven.

31
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,714
lf l am forgiven,
l would be made whole.

32
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,634
All l'll need then is the girl.

33
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,276
Suddenly, l knew, suddenly, l thought...

34
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,113
it's all a lie.

35
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,316
Paradise betrayed.

36
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,914
There was no God, only Satan,

37
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,677
sauntering behind me with a smirk,
saying, ''l'll get you in the end''.

38
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,038
<i>Tu es Petrus.
You're a brick, Pete.</i>

39
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,873
Here, people married.

40
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,554
Here, people died and were buried.

41
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,790
ln deconsecrated Catholic Churches,

42
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,192
now made into restaurants
as chic as anything abroad.

43
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,275
Now the congregation can eat
and drink in the sight of God,

44
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,829
who will, no doubt,
disapprove of cocktails in Babylon.

45
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,319
ls this happiness?

46
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,675
ls this perfection?

47
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,072
As you are now, we once were.
(James Joyce)

48
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,235
They that go down to the sea
in ships

49
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,675
and that do business
in great waters,

50
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,356
these see the works of the Lord,
and his wonders in the deep.

51
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,514
''Removed from the sight
of happier classes

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,390

On slow Saturdays,

56
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,156
when football, like life,
was still played in black and white,

57
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,515
and in shorts as long as underwear.

58
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,398
When it was still not venal.

59
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,269
When sportsmen and women
knew how to win and lose with grace

60
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,989
and never to punch the air in victory.

61
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,479
Match over; pea soup made;
my mother calling from the kitchen;

62
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,473
my eldest brother listening to
the football results

63
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,029
in front of the Bakelite radio,

64
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,829
marking his coupon,
hoping to win millions.

And on ever slower Sundays,

68
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,671
when it felt as if the whole world was
listening to the ''Light Programme'',

69
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,070
Kenneth Horne, promptly at 2 o'clock

70
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,152
and long before the repeal
of the Sexual Offences Act,

71
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,359
would visit two of
his very special friends.

72
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,990
<i>"l was recommended
to a firm of solicitors in Lincoln's lnn.</i>

73
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,594
<i>The brass plate on
the door read: Bona Law.</i>

74
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,308
<i>Hello! Anybody there?</i>

75
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,552
<i>Oh, hello, l'm Julian
and this is my friend, Sandy.</i>

76
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,429
<i>l've got me articles
and he's taken silk... frequently.</i>

77
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,878
<i>Well, Mr Horne, how nice to
varder your dolly old eek again.</i>

78
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,996
<i>Oh, what brings you trolling
in here?</i>

79
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,832
<i>Can you help me? l've erred.</i>

80
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,152
<i>Yeah, we've all 'eard, ducky.
lt's common knowledge, innit, Jules!</i>

81
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,675
<i>- Will you take my case?
- Depends on what it is.</i>

82
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,559
<i>We've got a criminal practice
that takes up most of our time.</i>

83
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,874
<i>- Yes, but apart from that.
- Oh! Ain't he bold!"</i>

84
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,316
But the law proscribed
and was anything but tolerant.

85
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,232
As when, contemporaneously,

86
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,516
two gay men were arrested
and convicted

87
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,636
and were to be made an example of.

88
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,394
And the judge said to them
before he was passing sentence,

89
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,233
<i>''Not only have you committed
an act of gross indecency,</i>

90
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,870
<i>''but you did it under

93
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,192
At seven, l saw Gene Kelly
and Singin'in the Rain

94
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,878
and discovered the movies, loved them
and swallowed them whole.

95
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,394
And my love was as muscular
as my Catholicism,

96
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,997
but without any of the drawbacks.
Musicals, Melodramas, Westerns,

97
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,709
nothing was too rich or too poor
for my rapacious appetite

98
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,874
and l gorged myself with a frequency
that would shame a sinner.

99
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,200
But soon, darker pleasures.

100
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,511
At 15, l saw Dirk Bogarde
in Victim

101
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,309
and discovered something
entirely different.

102
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,633
And when l was not at the movies,
on Friday nights,

103
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,475
l was at the Liverpool Stadium
watching the wrestling.

104
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,349
Not for its pantomimic villainy
but for something more illicit.

105
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,114
And in short, l was afraid.

106
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,510
As l struggled with
my adolescent desires,

107
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,511
as l waited at the top of the aisle,

108
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,989
as the wrestlers swaggered up
from the ring,

109
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,310
their trunks tight across the buttocks,

110
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,439
l could feel their body heat
as l furtively touched a back or a thigh,

111
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,272
choking with schoolboy guilt

112
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,069
and trembling with the fear
of the wrath of God.

113
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,439
Oh, save me from those dark desires
which thrill and compel.

114
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,151
The world. The flesh.
And the Devil.

115
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,313
Caught between Canon
and the criminal law,

116
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,278
l said goodbye to my girlhood.

117
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,271
Here, l wept...

118
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,752
wept and prayed until my knees bled,
but no succour came -

119
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,593
no peace granted.

120
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,160
Here was my whole world.

121
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,110
Home. School. The Movies.

122
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,669
And God.

123
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,513
You, who damn but give
no comfort.

124
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,035
Why do l plead?

125
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,113
Why do you not respond, angel eyes?

126
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,519
Jesus, mercy. Mary, help.

127
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,996
Lull me to safety.

128
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,598
Between sleeping and waking,
Earth does not revolve.

129
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,638
And slow turns the life
of meagre timbre,

130
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,631
of dullest breath.

131
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,431
Between birth and dying,
some lovely moments grow.

132
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,433
And sorrows not known until tomorrow,

133
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,673
cloud the happy hours
spent dreaming in the sun.

134
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,110
Between joy and consolation,
no easy path.

135
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,874
Some flights of fancy,
some colour.

136
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,157
Glorious old Hollywood;
small, comic England.

137
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,833
Black and white.

138
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,348
Between loving and hating,
the real journey starts.

139
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,353
Let go the latter,
embrace the former,

140
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,910
then fall to heaven on a gentle smile.

141
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,513
Between waking and sleeping,
the earth resumes its turn.

142
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,679
The soft light fills the room,

143
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,071
the nightly demons perish from the bed,

144
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,835
and all humanity braves
another day.

00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,757
* Dirty old town *

175
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,513
The year moves towards November.

176
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,399
Bonfire night, a penny for the guy,

177
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,869
someone singing
Keep the Heaven Fires Burning...

178
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,792
As Jimmy Preston and me, the only
ones left now, roast potatoes on sticks.

179
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,240
We sit, quiet at the last.

180
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,710
Jimmy Preston who was a real boy,
and whom l envied.

181
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,633
Jimmy Preston who once put
his hand on my shoulder,

182
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,916
and l didn't want him to remove it.

183
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,915
''Don't go in just yet.
Please, not just yet...''

184
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,239
But he does.

185
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,833
Twilight and evening bell.

186
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,195
And after that...

187
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,749
...the dark.

188
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,434
<i>"l would have liked to have
worked on,</i>

189
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,558
<i>but they threw me out
because l was old.</i>

190
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,950
<i>lt's a sin to grow old, you know.</i>

191
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,318
<i>We had an old lady here, and...</i>

192
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,076
<i>Everybody would run and get her
a cup of tea and they'd wait on her,</i>

193
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,869
<i>and do all those little things, but
she'd always say, "Nobody wants me."</i>

194
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,600
<i>Well, l mean if you take that attitude,</i>

195
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,513
<i>you can't expect anyone
to want you, can you?"</i>

196
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,038
Oh, watch and pray.
Watch and pray.

197
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,672
Do you remember, you who are
no longer young, and you who still are?

198
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,435
Do you remember the months of
November and December?

199
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,197
Wet shoes and leaking galoshes,
and for the first time...chilblains,

200
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,557
with Christmas in the air.

201
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,712
God was in his heaven,
and oh, how l believed!

202
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,394
Oh, how fervent l was!

203
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,677
And on Christmas Eve,
pork roasting in the oven,

204
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,276
the parlour cleaned,
with fruit along the sideboard.

205
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,318
A pound of apples, tangerines
in tissue paper,

206
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,395
a bowl of nuts
and our annual exotic pomegranate.

207
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,710
Do you remember?

208
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,075
Do you?

209
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,038
Will you ever forget?

210
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,349
My mother,

211
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,036
generous with the small nest egg
of twenty five pounds she'd borrowed.

212
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,712
Love and cellophane.

213
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,429
My brothers, with their made
to measure suits, bought on HP.

214
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,070
My sisters and a dab of scent,
maybe only Evening in Paris,

215
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,109
but making it seem as if the whole world
was drenched in Chanel.

216
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,599
Being taken to the Pictures, and in all
those movies, it was always Christmas

217
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,672
and it was always perfect.

218
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,719
<i>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,
Young at Heart,</i>

219
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,348
<i>All That Heaven Allows.</i>

220
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,958
But all...
all are gone - the old familiar faces.

221
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,236
And yet, time renders -

222
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,234
deceives the eye; deceives the heart,

223
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,960
a valediction and an epitaph.

224
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,915
Now voyager, go forth, to seek and find.

225
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,119
But my eldest brother, lying in
an army hospital in Leamington Spa.

226
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,273
He will not go to war.
He will be safe.

227
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,395
Cometh the hour. Cometh the man.

228
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,437
Cometh the Korean War.

229
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,109
For Queen, country and the Civil List.

230
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,239
And yet all over the country,
street parties were held

231
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,279
to celebrate the start of
the Betty Windsor show.

232
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,752
When the golden couple married,
in 1947,

233
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,673
the following was lavished
on the ceremony:

234
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,912
jewellery from other royals,
a washing machine,

235
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,437
a fridge, 76 handkerchiefs,
148 pairs of stockings,

236
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,478
38 handbags, 16 night gowns,

237
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,519
500 cases of tinned pineapple,
10,000 telegrams,

238
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,116
2000 guests, 5 Kings, 7 Queens,

239
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,033
8 Princes and 10 Princesses,

240
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,636
and for the 10,000 pearls
sewn onto her wedding dress,

241
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,839
Her Majesty allegedly saved
all her clothing coupons.

242
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,040
Even more money was wasted
on her Coronation,

243
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,671
as yet another fossil monarchy justified
its existence by tradition

244
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,549
and deluded itself
with the notion of 'duty'.

245
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,474
Privileged to the last, whilst in
England's green and pleasant land,

246
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,279
the rest of the nation survived
on rationing

247
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,273
in some of the worst slums in Europe

248
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,270
And in 'Bonny Scotland', they gave
Her Majesty a 21 hose salute.

249
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,477
Or maybe they were just taking the piss.

250
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,515
After Korea, EOKA and Mau-Mau,

251
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,638
lndia had gone, soon Africa would go.

252
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,677
Then Suez as a last hurrah,

253
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,799
leaving only a fading memory
of when most of the globe was red

254
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,593
and Victoria was the first and only
diminutive bourgeois imperatrix.

255
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,036
Betty and Phil
with a thousand flunkies.

256
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,753
''The trouble with being poor
is that it takes up all you time.''

257
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,956
(Willem de Kooning)

258
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,272
The trouble with being rich, is that it
takes up everybody else's.

259
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,279
After farce. Realism.

260
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,595
The heart that beats beneath the heart
is tender, is not savage

261
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,834
lt beats in time, though years apart,
from struggles silent marriage

262
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,992
Of storm and stress,
of quiet love

263
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,188
As when the lights begin to fall,
and he just smiles as she just hums

264
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,794
A tune that fitted like a glove

265
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,033
But tapped its rhyme,
still and small, into their room

266
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,591
When nightfall thrums,
a kind of peace that soothes the heart

267
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,719
And lets the years fall
from nought and down

268
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,190
As they shuffle off to bed, apart

269
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,273
Then meet again
beneath the eiderdown

270
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,876
By the waters of Babylon,
where we sat down,

271
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,828
Yea we wept,
when we remembered Zion.

272
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,956
And they that carried us away captive

273
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:19,797
Required of us a song, saying
''Sing us one of the songs of Zion.''

274
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,078
But how shall we sing
in a strange land?

275
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,474
And in an era when pop music
was still demure,

276
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,915
before Presley, before The Beatles.

277
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,073
John, Paul, George and Ringo -
not so much a musical phenomenon,

278
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,800
more like a firm of provincial solicitors.

279
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,635
When they are given
the freedom of the city,

280
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,554
Teddy Johnson and Pearl Carr,
Dicky Valentine, Lita Rosa,

281
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,429
Alma Cogan, sedate British Pop
was screamed away

282
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,511
on a tide of Mersey beat.

283
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,240
And the witty lyric
and the well crafted love song

284
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,520
seeming as antiquated
as antimacassars or curling tongs.

285
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,833
After the rise of Rock and Roll,
my interest in popular music waned,

286
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,754
and as it declined,
my love of classical music increased.

287
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,869
Sibelius, Shostakovich,
and my beloved Bruckner.

288
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,271
Then, in my overwrought
adolescent state of mind,

289
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,919
l discovered Mahler

290
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,074
and responded completely
to his every overwrought note.

291
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,994
And in Classical Music, they have
such wonderful foreign names.

292
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,675
Amy Shuard, Otto Klemperer,
Elizabeth Schwarzkopf,

293
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,673
Anneliese Rothenberger,
Furtwangler and Munch,

294
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,115
Knappertsbusch and Gauk,

295
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,479
Robert Merrill and Jussi Björling -
The Pearl Fishers.

296
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,116
But there was still ballroom dancing.

297
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,793
As staid as a funeral parlour,

298
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,236
hectares of tulle, Brylcreem
and the fishtail,

299
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,473
accompanied by Victor Silvester
and his famous orchestral whine,

300
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,315
as thin as a two-step,
as quick as a foxtrot.

301
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,668
Liverpool! Liverpool!

302
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,236
<i>"A thousand throng Aintree
Racecourse for The Grand National.</i>

303
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,916
<i>Even umbrella weather won't stop the
crowds coming to this racing classic."</i>

304
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,116
All of Britain listened to
the Grand National,

305
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,192
on radios as small
and brown as Hovis.

306
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,397
Made bets, off-course
and absolutely illegal,

307
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,233
but it was only once a year
and a shilling win.

308
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,231
So where was the harm?

309
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,312
Sundew, E.S.B, Early Mist.

310
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,519
Even Mum opened her purse
for her annual little flutter and said,

311
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,195
''l really fancy
Quare Times...each way.''

312
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,875
<i>"As they turn back towards
the fourteen jumps again..."</i>

313
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,237
Bob Danvers-Walker,
the voice of British Pathe,

314
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,075
Michael O'Hare, Peter O'Sullivan -
the voices of racing.

315
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,678
Listening to their controlled excitement
pouring through the wireless.

316
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,752
<i>"And Quare Times, who cost his owner
only 300 guineas,</i>

317
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,911
<i>has won the National..."</i>

318
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,595
Mum smiling at her small win,
and those who've lost think,

319
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,228
''Well, there's always next year...

320
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,152
...God willing.''

321
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,315
The 12th of July and the Orange Day
Parade through the city.

322
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,438
Winding their way towards
Exchange Station in Southport

323
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,955
to toast King Billy in a perruque
and say,

324
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,112
''Fuck the Pope
and all those Fenian bastards.''

325
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,829
Whatever, whoever they were.

326
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,356
And on the train coming home,
slightly the worse for wear,

327
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,069
howling at the papist moon.

328
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,511
But no religious divide in my street,

329
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,878
just quiet acceptance that Catholics
did everything in mysterious Latin,

330
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,112
while Protestants sang,
Jesus Wants me for a Sunbeam ,

331
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,238
in plain, no nonsense English.

332
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,633
Although sometimes,

333
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,112
it felt as if one's entire world
was one, long Sunday afternoon.

334
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,078
Nothing to do. Nowhere to go.

335
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,714
Then Mum or one of my sisters
would say,

336
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,677
''Let's have a day out next week.''

337
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,277
And the ensuing seven days
were streaked and gilded.

338
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,429
But you still had to wait.

339
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,353
Those days, queuing was de rigueur.

340
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,195
Queuing modestly for modest
entertainment at the local fête.

341
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,113
ln posh parts of the city,
like Stoneycroft,

342
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,068
where they sounded their 'H's
and knew what sculleries were.

343
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,234
A jumble sale, a fancy dress parade,

344
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,119
a foot race, with someone collapsing
with heat stroke

345
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,319
because the temperature rose
a couple of degrees above freezing.

346
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,552
The Scouts, darts
and a May Queen crowned.

347
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,918
A Nation deprived of luxury,
relishing these small delights.

348
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,030
Decorated prams and bicycles,
a smattering of applause.

349
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,395
All the fun of the fair.

350
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,830
So, to New Brighton.
Only a ferry ride away,

351
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,831
but happiness on a budget.

352
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,228
They board in black and white
then disembark in colour.

353
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,470
For things were changing.

354
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,237
World War ll was over,
peace time and hardship eased.

355
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,513
And all day on the beach,
completely unsupervised

356
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,558
with no factor 200 sun block
and safe as houses...

357
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,358
...little baby Joyce.

358
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,958
Tarquin and Gemma,
being as yet, unknown.

359
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,590
Stiff at ''Joy Time'' with Aunty Lil.

360
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,231
Bathing Beauty Competitions,
in their day, harmless.

361
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,072
Now, as quaint as the bustle,

362
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,994
now, as unacceptable
as Chinese foot binding.

363
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,880
Pretty young women being kissed
by the Lord Mayor,

364
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,636
given a sash, a trophy
and some small, modest fame.

365
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,553
And oh...how we laughed!

366
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,432
A stroll along the Prom,
deckchairs and the floral clock.

367
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,273
Sand in the egg sandwiches.

368
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,830
Tea at three, then a snooze.

369
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,150
New Brighton rock as sweet as sick

370
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,790
and gobstoppers that would last
until your middle age.

371
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,959
A ride or two, then the miniature railway.

372
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,998
Then maybe to the dance,
maybe a jive,

373
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,948
maybe a gin and orange,
and maybe...love.

374
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,397
Kiss me quick and roll me over,
announce an engagement,

375
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,278
plan a wedding.

376
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,194
Taffeta skirts and blue serge,
youth that cannot end,

377
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,351
hopes as high as Blackpool Tower,

378
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,036
when all the world was young
and knew no bounds.

379
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,676
Then the journey home. Tired.

380
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,470
Cocoa and toast
and happiness unlimited.

381
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,797
''The golden moments pass
and leave no trace.'' (Chekhov)

382
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,192
We had hoped for paradise.

383
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,794
We got the 'Anus Mundi'!

384
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,316
Rise, oh, rise.
Oh, surely thou shalt rise.

385
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,232
But not before the opening

386
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,994
of the Metropolitan Cathedral
of Christ the King,

387
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,357
inaugurated by Cardinal Heenan
in his brand new frock -

388
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,273
the Vatican's response to Schiaparelli.

389
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,193
l had lived my spiritual and religious life
under popes Pius Xll,

390
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,352
John XXlll
and Clitoris the umpteenth,

391
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,909
which is enough to turn anyone pagan.

392
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,356
As far as l knew, Holy Mother Church
still wanted me.

393
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,988
But l no longer wanted her.

394
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,551
For l was now a very happy,
very contented, born again atheist.

395
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,553
O come, all ye faithful.
Have another plateful.

396
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,030
Municipal architecture.
Dispiriting at the best of times,

397
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,875
but when combined with
the British genius for creating the dismal,

398
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,079
makes for a cityscape
which is anything but Elysian.

399
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:18,111
Out to sea, the dawn wind
wrinkles and slides.

400
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,392
l am here, or elsewhere.

401
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,711
ln my end is my beginning.

402
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:35,959
"We meet our destiny on the road
we take to avoid it." (Carl Jung)

403
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,788
l said to my soul, be still
and let the dark come upon you

404
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,918
which shall be the darkness of God.

405
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,471
l said to my soul, be still
and wait without hope,

406
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,108
for hope would be hope
for the wrong thing.

407
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,909
Wait without love, for love
would be love of the wrong thing.

408
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,832
There is yet faith.

409
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,675
But the faith, the love and the hope
are all in the waiting -

410
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,912
the rest is not our business -

411
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,230
at the still point of the turning world,

412
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,359
suspended in time
between pole and tropic.

413
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,478
And all is always now.

414
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,995
Home is where one starts from.

415
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,913
As we grow older,
the world becomes stranger,

416
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,789
the pattern more complicated
of dead and living.

417
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,520
There is a time for the evening
under starlight;

418
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:33,549
a time for the evening under lamplight;
the evening with the photograph album.

419
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:39,033
Love is most nearly itself
when here and now cease to matter.

420
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,909
l said to my soul, be still

421
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,596
and accept this, my chanson d'amour
for all that has passed.

422
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,514
But where, oh, where are you
the Liverpool l knew and loved?

423
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,148
Where have you gone without me?

424
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:58,393
And now l'm an alien in my own land.

425
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,950
''O Tempora o mores.''

426
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,510
Oh, the times, oh, the fashions.

427
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,349
Tread gently, stranger
as you softly turn the key

428
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,674
To unlock time and cause the years
to fall towards their end

429
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,037
Speak low, Love, but speak wisely

430
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,431
For frail time hangs by a thread
above the world

431
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,592
With only hope to keep us safe

432
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,515
Tap lightly at the door,
then close it with a silent shock

433
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,673
But never, ever yield to the night

434
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,070
We shall return with hope
to the good earth.

435
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,279
And you, my dear children,
you are the earth.

436
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:42,353
l reason, earth is short -

437
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,670
And anguish - Absolute -

438
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,308
And many hurt,

439
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,232
But, what of that?

440
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,513
I reason, we could die -

441
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,151
The best vitality
Cannot excel decay,

442
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,039
But, what of that?

443
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,395
I reason, that in Heaven -
Somehow, it will be even -

444
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,632
Some new equation, given -

445
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,911
But, what of that?

446
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,514
We shall not cease from exploration.

447
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,673
And the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started

448
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,274
and to know the place for the first time.

449
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,156
Through the unknown remembered gate,

450
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,677
when the last of earth left to discover
is that which was the beginning.

451
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:24,392
A condition of complete simplicity
costing not less than everything.

452
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,235
And all shall be well

453
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:32,235
And all manner of thing
shall be well.

454
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,075
lf all the world and Love were young

455
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,708
And truth in every shepherd's tongue

456
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,474
These pretty pleasures might me move

457
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,712
To live with thee, and be thy love

458
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,270
But time drives flocks from field to fold

459
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,079
When rivers rage and rocks grow cold

460
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,708
And Philomel becometh dumb

461
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,758
The rest complains of cares to come

462
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:08,276
The flowers do fade, and wanton fields
to wayward winter reckoning yields

463
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,954
A honey tongue, a heart of gall

464
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,556
ls Fancy's spring but Sorrow's fall

465
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,030
Thy gowns, thy shoes,
thy beds of roses

466
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,557
Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies

467
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,872
Soon break, soon wither,
soon forgotten

468
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,874
ln folly ripe, in reason rotten

469
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,315
Thy belt of straw and ivy buds

470
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,392
Thy coral clasps and amber studs

471
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,757
All those in me no means
can move

472
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,957
To come to thee and be thy love

473
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,476
But could youth last
and love still breed

474
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,155
Had joys no date
nor age no need

475
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,915
Then those delights
my mind might move

476
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:57,119
To live with thee and be thy love

477
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,671
We are being gathered in...

478
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,553
...at gloaming.

479
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,275
ls it sleep?

480
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,034
Or is it death?
