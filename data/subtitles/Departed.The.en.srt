1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,060
<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i>

2
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:52,874
<i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i>

3
00:00:56,078 --> 00:00:58,341
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

4
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:03,143
<i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>

5
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,682
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:10,051
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:13,623
<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i>

8
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:15,025
<i>True guineas.</i>

9
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:17,722
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

10
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,299
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i>

11
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:28,603
<i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i>

12
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:32,079
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

13
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:36,515
<i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

14
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:38,813
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

15
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:40,888
<i>You have to take it.</i>

16
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:06,111
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:02:06,283 --> 00:02:08,774
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:15,219
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

19
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,485
You should be proud.

20
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:32,865
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:50,993
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

22
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,162
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:56,466 --> 00:03:00,699
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

24
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:03,431
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

25
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:08,169
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

26
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:12,038
You do good in school?

27
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:17,187
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:19,949
They call that a paradox.

29
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:25,057
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,829
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

31
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,701
You know where I am on L Street?

32
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:39,502
Good.

33
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:42,201
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:44,414 --> 00:03:48,146
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,311
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:53,615
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,090
<i>- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.</i>

38
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,820
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

39
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:02,489
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,828
A man makes his own way.

41
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:06,596
No one gives it to you.

42
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,635
You have to take it.

43
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,074
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

44
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:15,710
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,576
...tried to tell me what to do.

46
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,516
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:26,689
Maybe like that:

48
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:37,192
Jeez. She fell funny.

49
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:42,605
Francis, you really should see somebody.

50
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:46,074
<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>

51
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:49,509
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

52
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:54,209
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

53
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:57,149
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:57,322 --> 00:05:00,884
When you're facing a loaded gun...

55
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:05,024
...what's the difference?

56
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:09,997
<i>That's my boy.</i>

57
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:13,300
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

58
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:16,168
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:19,435
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9mm hollow-point.

60
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:23,240
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:26,283
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>

62
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,615
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

63
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:30,915
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,526
<i>...tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

65
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:38,254
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

66
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,329
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:52,307
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,175
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,141
Pencils.

70
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,185
Begin.

71
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:15,923
What are you looking at?

72
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,137
Forget it.

73
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:23,935
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

74
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:30,213
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:32,177
They are.

76
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:35,913
So she tells me, "You never finish
anything. You finish the police course...

77
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,528
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

78
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:44,528
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

79
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:45,721
Fuck yourself.

80
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:48,264
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

81
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:50,995
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

82
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:54,437
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

83
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:58,108
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:01,372
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:05,314
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:10,855
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:12,959
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

88
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:16,221
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:30,435
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right
out of the gate, congratulations.

90
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,377
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:45,316
School's out.

92
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,028
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,821
You earned it.

94
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:54,057
No more pencils, no more books.

95
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:57,759
All right.

96
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:59,461
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

97
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:01,540
<i>- ... this is the state police.
- And fire!</i>

98
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,834
<i>Your training will
illustrate the difference.</i>

99
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:06,708
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

100
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,245
<i>What's the difference?</i>

101
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:10,815
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

102
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:14,045
<i>- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

103
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:17,384
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:31,303
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

105
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:34,965
- ...to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,009
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

107
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:42,013
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

108
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,682
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:48,846
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

110
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:53,052
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

111
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:55,595
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:04,996
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

113
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:09,801
You can go in there now.

114
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:17,711
You can sit.

115
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:24,390
So...

116
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:28,326
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,294
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:35,163
...and leave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:37,828
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:41,932
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

121
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,634
We would be cunts.

122
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:45,837
Are you calling us cunts?

123
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:48,414
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

124
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:51,519
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

125
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,148
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:58,850
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

127
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:05,667
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:10,134
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

129
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:14,037
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:18,144
That's right.

131
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:20,706
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

132
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:23,113
Closed casket?

133
00:10:24,788 --> 00:10:26,551
That's right.

134
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:29,091
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

135
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,386
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:34,961
...you had an uncle met his demise
like that?

137
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:40,903
I got a question.

138
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,129
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,543
Hi, Darlene.

140
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:02,952
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:07,929
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

142
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:12,061
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

143
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:15,363
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

144
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:18,201
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:23,110
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:25,375
You got any suits,
or do you like...

147
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:28,383
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

148
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,384
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

149
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:36,924
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

150
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:40,120
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:43,630
- ...from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,563
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:52,907
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:56,638
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

155
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:59,908
This is an elite unit.

156
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:04,350
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

157
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:06,581
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:09,486
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:12:09,658 --> 00:12:12,423
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:14,758
And we will do it.

161
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:18,389
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:20,864
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

163
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:23,096
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:25,203
Last known photograph.

165
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:28,836
Costello uses three key guys.

166
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,540
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:35,413
<i>She's straight out of Going My Way.</i>

168
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:37,678
Delahunt, muscle.

169
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:41,813
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:44,722
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

171
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,057
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,359
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

173
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:52,298
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:54,768
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:57,908
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

176
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:00,543
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

177
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:03,179
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:07,216
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

179
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:10,287
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

180
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:12,751
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:16,793
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

182
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:19,192
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,298
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:25,731
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,873
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,532
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,474
Yup.
You have different accents?

188
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:38,538
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

189
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:41,947
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,088
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,750
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

192
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,990
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,491
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

194
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,298
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

195
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:05,764
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,110
We have a question.

197
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:16,948
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,419
It's an honest question.

199
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,253
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:25,054
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

201
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,028
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

202
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,465
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,727
Hey, he can't help you.

204
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,871
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,403
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:39,010
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

207
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:41,145
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,842
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

209
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,851
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

210
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,855
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

211
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,620
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:58,456
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,722
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:06,630
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,736
You don't have much family.

216
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,404
I don't have any family.

217
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:22,419
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

218
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:25,523
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

219
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:29,092
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:33,096
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

221
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:38,260
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

222
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,673
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:45,868
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:48,740
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:53,615
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:58,552
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

227
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:05,697
Do you need some money for the funeral?

228
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,730
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:17,335
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,139
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,544
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,676
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

233
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,258
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

234
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,990
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

235
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,995
A state-police detective.

236
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,500
And are you a married
state-police detective?

237
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,168
No.

238
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:46,767
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

239
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,965
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:53,837
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

241
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,312
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:58,947
Sure.

243
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:04,255
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

244
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,950
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:10,325
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

246
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:13,694
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,665
Amen.

248
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,092
So what do I do?

249
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:44,229
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

250
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,492
...but there's a bonus involved.

251
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:49,000
Tax-free.

252
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,906
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:58,807
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

254
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,038
Given your nature.

255
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:03,218
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:05,910
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,781
...the whole nine yards.

258
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:12,284
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

259
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:14,818
We need you, pal.

260
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:17,864
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,990
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

262
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,502
Do it again.

263
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:28,336
For me.

264
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:05,579
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:08,648
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

266
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:12,151
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:14,983
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

268
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,838
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

269
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,943
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:19:37,113 --> 00:19:40,105
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:44,450
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:46,884
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

273
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:49,287
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:52,822
So you know.

275
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:55,828
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,800
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:02,096
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

278
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:04,901
My mother's dead.

279
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:09,469
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

280
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:12,205
I was at a funeral myself, man.

281
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:15,384
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

282
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:19,815
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

283
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,151
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

284
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,651
I got, like...

285
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:29,287
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

286
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:32,230
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:35,065
In your line of work, if I gave you...

288
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:38,935
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

289
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:42,474
You know what you...

290
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:44,977
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

291
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:49,244
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

292
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:53,320
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,116
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:01,830
I'm not a cop, all right?

295
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:06,165
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

296
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,131
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:14,868
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:18,573
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:22,219
<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>

300
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:25,480
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:28,625
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:32,228
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

303
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:35,855
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

304
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,467
This side of Worcester.

305
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:41,365
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

306
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:43,529
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:45,539
...concerned.

308
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:51,582
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,115
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

310
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:57,048
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

311
00:21:57,221 --> 00:21:59,689
Well, I knew his father.

312
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,585
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

313
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,251
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

314
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:07,396
Fucking guineas.

315
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:10,066
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

316
00:22:11,336 --> 00:22:13,326
Cranberry juice.

317
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,666
It's a natural diuretic.

318
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:20,038
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:23,144
What, do you got your period?

320
00:22:27,352 --> 00:22:29,786
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

321
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:36,588
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:22:38,063 --> 00:22:39,654
Do you know me?

323
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:41,693
No. No.

324
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:46,067
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:22:46,238 --> 00:22:48,229
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:22:48,406 --> 00:22:50,397
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:52,838
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:55,673
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

329
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:58,874
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:04,246
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:23:05,757 --> 00:23:09,352
I fucking know you. I know your family.

332
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:11,487
You make one more drug deal...

333
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:14,497
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,962
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:21,230
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:26,140
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:29,570
What are you drinking?

338
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:38,548
A cranberry juice.

339
00:23:39,892 --> 00:23:42,019
What is it, your period?

340
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:48,295
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,865
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:23:58,477 --> 00:24:00,707
What? "Oh," fucking what?

343
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:05,848
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:07,685
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:10,788
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:12,548
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:24:12,726 --> 00:24:14,955
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:17,356
Okay, my people are out there.

349
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:20,089
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:22,701
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:25,701
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

352
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:28,806
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:31,240
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:33,674
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:35,680
Good. Today, girls...

356
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:37,749
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:42,250
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

358
00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:44,981
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

359
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,421
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:50,426
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

361
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:52,427
...from a couple hundred miles away.

362
00:24:52,598 --> 00:24:55,432
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

363
00:24:55,602 --> 00:24:58,162
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:24:58,337 --> 00:25:01,272
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:03,500
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

366
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,042
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:08,374
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

368
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,105
Southie projects.

369
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:12,945
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

370
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,145
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:25:16,323 --> 00:25:18,051
- ...which happens to...
- South Boston?

372
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:21,285
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:24,657
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,559
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,169
We're here to nail Costello.

376
00:25:31,337 --> 00:25:32,805
All right, look. We got a guy...

377
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:35,499
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:38,144
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:40,711
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

380
00:25:40,882 --> 00:25:44,317
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

381
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,215
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

382
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,988
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:52,854
Maybe fuck yourself.

384
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:55,358
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

385
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:57,430
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:25:57,596 --> 00:25:59,223
You girls have a good day.

387
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:03,696
Normally he's a very nice guy.

388
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:05,770
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

389
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:12,006
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,909
I knew Myles.

391
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:16,914
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

392
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:19,244
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

393
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,412
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

394
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:25,423
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

395
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:27,424
Allegedly.

396
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:29,590
Allegedly.

397
00:26:29,763 --> 00:26:32,231
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

398
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:34,368
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:36,594
He did something else wrong?

400
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:41,898
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

401
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:45,940
I mean, fuck yourself.

402
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,050
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

403
00:26:50,218 --> 00:26:53,653
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,623
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:27:10,372 --> 00:27:12,635
You making a house call?

406
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:15,265
Have I seen you professionally?

407
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:18,935
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:27:19,114 --> 00:27:22,777
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

409
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:26,546
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

410
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:30,556
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

411
00:27:30,726 --> 00:27:32,386
I have an appointment on this floor.

412
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,019
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

413
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:38,290
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

414
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:40,559
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

415
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:43,864
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

416
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,336
Suffolk, nights?

417
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:48,374
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

418
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:52,037
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

419
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,979
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

420
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,811
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:27:57,986 --> 00:28:00,784
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

422
00:28:00,957 --> 00:28:06,054
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:08,458
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

424
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:11,656
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

425
00:28:11,835 --> 00:28:13,325
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

426
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:26,942
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

427
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:29,949
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

428
00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:33,246
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:36,549
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

430
00:28:36,726 --> 00:28:38,022
All right, have a nice day.

431
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:41,023
Cut him here.

432
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:43,265
Bye-bye.

433
00:28:47,503 --> 00:28:48,528
Jerk-ass!

434
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:51,366
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

435
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,067
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

436
00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:58,213
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

437
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:00,872
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

438
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:04,076
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:05,481
I'm trying to help you.

440
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:09,090
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:12,717
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

442
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:16,355
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:19,366
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:21,970
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:25,005
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:27,403
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

447
00:29:27,577 --> 00:29:29,807
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:33,073
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

449
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:34,772
You fellas come from Providence?

450
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:37,010
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:39,711
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

452
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:52,729
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

453
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:54,663
Fuck!

454
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:58,000
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:05,280
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:15,618
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

457
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:19,854
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

458
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:28,503
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:30,230
Was your meal okay?

460
00:30:30,406 --> 00:30:31,964
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

461
00:30:32,143 --> 00:30:35,544
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,048
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:46,155
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:47,688
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,798
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

466
00:30:57,968 --> 00:30:59,833
...in your office all day long?

467
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:02,633
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

468
00:31:03,974 --> 00:31:06,340
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

469
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,910
- No, no, no.
- No?

470
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:10,411
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:13,978
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,550
Yeah, I do.

473
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,884
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

474
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:22,691
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:28,326
Don't you?

476
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:31,968
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

477
00:31:32,136 --> 00:31:33,569
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:36,297
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:40,740
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

480
00:31:41,712 --> 00:31:44,045
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

481
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:47,378
So you're up shit's creek with a
client list full of mick cops.

482
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:49,542
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

483
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,882
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,218
Some people do get better.

485
00:31:58,229 --> 00:31:59,559
Fair enough.

486
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:03,429
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

487
00:32:04,403 --> 00:32:05,631
Including the criminals?

488
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:08,067
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,968
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

490
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:15,971
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

491
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:18,240
I'll arrest you right now.

492
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,352
<i>My word against yours.</i>

493
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,446
...then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,659
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

495
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:32,854
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

496
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:37,933
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

497
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:41,970
Schuyler.

498
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:57,951
Do you know who I am?

499
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:02,717
No.

500
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:11,066
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:23,738
His real name Mr. French?

502
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:28,314
No.

503
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:33,893
Come with me.

504
00:33:38,431 --> 00:33:42,697
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:49,365
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:53,411
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

507
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:02,318
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:04,650
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,557
What they're gonna do...

510
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:11,322
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

511
00:34:11,498 --> 00:34:14,523
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

512
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:17,101
Unless I stop them.

513
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:19,338
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:24,704
Is this something I can't do personally?

515
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,380
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,847
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:34:33,018 --> 00:34:35,748
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,791
Shoes.

519
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:45,922
I knew your father.

520
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:52,233
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:56,074
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:34:56,842 --> 00:34:59,902
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

523
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:02,811
Yeah, that was his problem.

524
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:04,815
Who said he had a problem?

525
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:09,646
I just said he had a fucking problem.

526
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,289
There's a man could've been anything.

527
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,860
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,465
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:21,498
- He's clean.
- Arm.

530
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:22,931
Yeah, come on.

531
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:24,628
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:35:24,804 --> 00:35:28,137
Show me your arm. Flip it.

533
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:38,476
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,552
He's clean.

535
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,987
And if I can slander my own
environment...

536
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,958
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,090
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

538
00:35:54,268 --> 00:35:58,568
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:01,673
I just can't know.

540
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:06,340
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

541
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:10,742
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

542
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:14,255
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

543
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,255
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:23,096
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

545
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,393
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:29,596
All right, all right, all right.

547
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,568
You're okay. You'll be all right.

548
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,974
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:41,606
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:46,512
As for our problem with Providence...

551
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:50,153
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

552
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:55,663
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,266
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:37:04,206 --> 00:37:05,673
She's on her way out.

555
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,900
We all are. Act accordingly.

556
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,440
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:37:11,614 --> 00:37:13,775
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:17,043
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

559
00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:20,547
Do you trust him?

560
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:22,416
Well, these days...

561
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,717
...who's reliable?

562
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,228
His Uncle Jackie was.

563
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:32,389
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

564
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,036
I'm reliable.

565
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:43,277
Arnold, you're one in a million.

566
00:37:43,445 --> 00:37:46,108
Ten. Ten million.

567
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,746
What about your wife, Arnold?

568
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:54,813
Well, I thought she was.

569
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,088
She wasn't.

570
00:38:00,396 --> 00:38:02,262
Well, she got reliable.

571
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:07,393
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:38:08,572 --> 00:38:10,597
Another county heard from.

573
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:12,501
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:14,768
Answer this for me, will you?

575
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,159
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

576
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:43,032
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd appreciate
it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:38:43,206 --> 00:38:45,971
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

578
00:38:46,143 --> 00:38:47,610
Thanks.

579
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:54,108
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

580
00:38:54,284 --> 00:38:56,081
Can I meet you for lunch?

581
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:57,514
All right, see you then.

582
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,722
Who's the lead detective?

583
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:06,726
Good. He's a lox.

584
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:18,967
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas for
the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:20,871
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

586
00:39:21,043 --> 00:39:25,344
Look in his car, you'll find the gun that
did it, registered, official. Providence.

587
00:39:25,516 --> 00:39:27,710
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

588
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:31,043
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,989
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:40,460
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,695
Have a seat, Bill.

592
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:58,847
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:03,010
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

594
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:07,684
Lennon said:

595
00:40:08,425 --> 00:40:10,121
"I'm an artist.

596
00:40:10,295 --> 00:40:14,697
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

597
00:40:18,969 --> 00:40:20,300
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

598
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:23,735
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:33,514
Smart-mouth.

600
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:36,351
Too bad.

601
00:40:37,554 --> 00:40:39,853
If you'll indulge me...

602
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:42,748
Now what?

603
00:40:44,295 --> 00:40:46,230
Choir practice.

604
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:48,596
Choir practice...

605
00:40:53,438 --> 00:40:55,871
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:40:57,007 --> 00:41:00,773
...a man could look at anything...

607
00:41:00,978 --> 00:41:02,606
...and make something out of it.

608
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,248
For instance...

609
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:06,815
...I look at you and I think:

610
00:41:07,753 --> 00:41:10,152
What could I use you for?

611
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,152
Get rid of this.

612
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:15,815
French.

613
00:41:15,994 --> 00:41:18,463
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>

614
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,326
Maybe we could work something out.

615
00:41:21,164 --> 00:41:24,463
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

616
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:26,603
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:29,001
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:41:29,641 --> 00:41:31,108
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,943
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

620
00:41:43,054 --> 00:41:45,818
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

621
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:48,684
<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>

622
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,125
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:53,697
<i>- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.</i>

624
00:41:53,865 --> 00:41:56,164
<i>- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.</i>

625
00:41:56,335 --> 00:41:59,202
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:02,306
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

627
00:42:02,474 --> 00:42:04,873
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:42:05,043 --> 00:42:07,307
<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>

629
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,469
...you let us know.

630
00:42:12,452 --> 00:42:14,646
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:42:15,554 --> 00:42:17,318
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:19,480
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:22,954
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:25,460
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

635
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,827
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

636
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:30,831
I believe it's been in the papers.

637
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:34,039
You seem quite happy with that result.

638
00:42:35,574 --> 00:42:37,202
It's a fucking result.

639
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:40,641
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:42:40,813 --> 00:42:43,838
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:49,085
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:52,416
- Where's your license?
- What license?

643
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,525
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

644
00:42:55,695 --> 00:42:58,822
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

645
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:02,398
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

646
00:43:02,568 --> 00:43:05,094
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

647
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:07,204
...into Mr. Costello's area.

648
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:15,139
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:43:15,315 --> 00:43:16,338
Hey.

650
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:19,614
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:26,521
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

652
00:43:27,661 --> 00:43:29,322
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:31,293
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:43:31,465 --> 00:43:33,364
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:43:33,532 --> 00:43:36,831
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:43:37,003 --> 00:43:39,630
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

657
00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:41,900
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

658
00:43:42,074 --> 00:43:44,599
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:47,905
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:50,949
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

661
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:55,349
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

662
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:57,248
Hi, Captain.

663
00:43:57,425 --> 00:43:58,619
This crazy fuck...

664
00:43:58,793 --> 00:44:00,920
- ...knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

665
00:44:01,094 --> 00:44:03,188
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:44:03,364 --> 00:44:06,197
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

667
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:07,628
He reached into his coat.

668
00:44:07,802 --> 00:44:10,032
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:44:10,204 --> 00:44:12,637
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:44:12,806 --> 00:44:14,865
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:17,306
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:44:17,478 --> 00:44:18,809
...which is the right thing.

673
00:44:18,978 --> 00:44:21,606
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:44:22,115 --> 00:44:24,016
Bottom line...

675
00:44:24,186 --> 00:44:26,278
...we think we might have a problem.

676
00:44:26,454 --> 00:44:29,320
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

677
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,391
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

678
00:44:33,561 --> 00:44:35,858
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

679
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,625
No, no, not presently.

680
00:44:38,798 --> 00:44:40,231
But I'm working on that.

681
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,527
Here, Bill, this is for you.

682
00:44:43,204 --> 00:44:46,833
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:50,500
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:53,577
You wait. We'll call you.

685
00:44:53,746 --> 00:44:55,407
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

686
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:58,518
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

687
00:44:58,686 --> 00:45:00,313
Good.

688
00:45:01,822 --> 00:45:03,686
Hi, Dad.

689
00:45:04,391 --> 00:45:06,655
I got promoted. All right.

690
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:26,179
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:29,079
You know...

692
00:45:30,351 --> 00:45:32,717
...if your father were alive...

693
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:34,947
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:37,387
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:40,356
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:42,759
And he could do it...

697
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:47,233
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

698
00:45:52,007 --> 00:45:56,603
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

699
00:45:56,777 --> 00:46:00,269
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

700
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,746
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

701
00:46:03,818 --> 00:46:05,445
Your Uncle Jackie...

702
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:10,387
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

703
00:46:12,393 --> 00:46:14,987
And I think about this.

704
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:23,597
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

705
00:46:24,405 --> 00:46:27,306
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

706
00:46:27,476 --> 00:46:29,501
School?

707
00:46:31,514 --> 00:46:34,244
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

708
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,510
...school is out.

709
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:40,016
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

710
00:46:41,824 --> 00:46:43,085
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:47,260
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,092
You recall our chat?

713
00:46:50,398 --> 00:46:52,492
Little boys...

714
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:57,099
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

715
00:46:57,706 --> 00:47:00,106
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

716
00:47:02,177 --> 00:47:07,514
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:47:07,684 --> 00:47:11,710
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

718
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:17,192
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,760
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:47:21,563 --> 00:47:23,724
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

721
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,594
Pay them.

722
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:29,963
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:47:36,778 --> 00:47:39,907
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

724
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:42,449
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

725
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:44,552
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

726
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:47,280
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:47:47,456 --> 00:47:50,119
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

728
00:47:50,293 --> 00:47:52,920
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

729
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:55,063
Beeper number.

730
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:58,063
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

731
00:47:59,135 --> 00:48:01,434
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

732
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,143
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:10,438
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:48:10,947 --> 00:48:14,041
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

735
00:48:14,217 --> 00:48:16,275
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

736
00:48:16,452 --> 00:48:17,715
- It's off?
- You're good.

737
00:48:17,887 --> 00:48:20,550
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,052
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

739
00:48:23,226 --> 00:48:26,684
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

740
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:29,856
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

741
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,693
...I need to be made aware of?

742
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:36,398
I beeped you.

743
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:39,699
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:43,277
- That's it?
- That's it.

745
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:47,916
You need to call your mother...

746
00:48:48,085 --> 00:48:50,384
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:48:55,092 --> 00:48:58,619
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

748
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:05,231
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:49:05,469 --> 00:49:08,996
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:12,532
So make the call.

751
00:49:17,181 --> 00:49:20,639
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:49:22,052 --> 00:49:24,715
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:46,000
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:49:46,177 --> 00:49:48,110
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

755
00:49:49,646 --> 00:49:52,581
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:56,849
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

757
00:49:57,021 --> 00:49:58,784
Bye.

758
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,188
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:20,539
Thank you.

760
00:50:21,847 --> 00:50:23,280
So who are you?

761
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:26,884
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:50:27,052 --> 00:50:28,713
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:32,219
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

764
00:50:32,389 --> 00:50:35,085
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

765
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,353
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:50:37,528 --> 00:50:40,896
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,876
The light's nice here in the morning.

768
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:01,478
So do you wanna talk about last night?

769
00:51:08,126 --> 00:51:11,653
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

770
00:51:17,235 --> 00:51:19,170
It's actually quite common.

771
00:51:19,338 --> 00:51:20,931
I gotta go to work.

772
00:51:30,148 --> 00:51:31,980
Do you lie?

773
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:35,876
Why? Do you?

774
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:37,750
No, I'm asking if you lie.

775
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:41,224
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:43,487
Yeah, you lie.

777
00:51:43,663 --> 00:51:44,822
You lie.

778
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,655
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

779
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:49,893
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:51:50,536 --> 00:51:55,496
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

781
00:51:58,945 --> 00:52:00,936
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:06,545
Did you?

783
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:08,346
No.

784
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:12,420
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:15,186
Talk about how you feel.

786
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:19,293
<i>How I feel.</i>

787
00:52:19,465 --> 00:52:21,365
<i>How I feel.</i>

788
00:52:42,222 --> 00:52:43,951
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

789
00:52:49,228 --> 00:52:52,163
No. Please. No.

790
00:52:52,331 --> 00:52:54,128
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:52:57,637 --> 00:52:58,969
<i>You sit there...</i>

792
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:01,369
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:03,336
A mass murderer.

794
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:06,706
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,510
And your hand...

796
00:53:11,184 --> 00:53:12,583
...steady.

797
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:19,289
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

798
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,655
...does not shake.

799
00:53:22,463 --> 00:53:23,952
Ever.

800
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:34,932
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,402
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

802
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:41,782
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:46,750
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

804
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,081
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

805
00:53:49,255 --> 00:53:52,452
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:55,856
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

807
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,391
Should I?

808
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:02,032
So do they all come in here...

809
00:54:02,202 --> 00:54:04,432
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:54:04,938 --> 00:54:07,907
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:54:08,074 --> 00:54:11,271
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

812
00:54:11,445 --> 00:54:13,572
Use their weapons?

813
00:54:14,114 --> 00:54:15,581
Let me tell you something.

814
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,047
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:20,686
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:54:20,855 --> 00:54:23,755
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:26,951
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

818
00:54:27,128 --> 00:54:28,925
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:54:36,371 --> 00:54:38,271
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

820
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,967
I see that you have a record of assault.

821
00:54:42,143 --> 00:54:43,666
Yeah.

822
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:45,971
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

823
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,612
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:54:50,784 --> 00:54:52,615
Did something happen to you?

825
00:54:52,987 --> 00:54:54,420
No.

826
00:54:56,623 --> 00:55:01,083
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:55:01,262 --> 00:55:04,663
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:07,733
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

829
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:10,268
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

830
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:12,030
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:55:12,206 --> 00:55:15,335
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

832
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:18,639
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

833
00:55:18,813 --> 00:55:21,179
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:24,911
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:55:25,086 --> 00:55:27,112
How about we just erase your file, huh?

836
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:29,052
How about we erase your file...

837
00:55:29,224 --> 00:55:31,659
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

838
00:55:31,827 --> 00:55:35,057
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

839
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:38,826
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

840
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:41,128
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

841
00:55:41,302 --> 00:55:43,532
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:55:43,706 --> 00:55:49,076
- ...you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:55:49,244 --> 00:55:53,146
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:56,009
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:59,483
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:55:59,655 --> 00:56:01,213
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:56:01,389 --> 00:56:03,755
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:07,722
When are you gonna take Costello?

849
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:10,025
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:13,498
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:56:13,668 --> 00:56:15,364
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:18,474
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:22,338
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,206
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

855
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,143
Will you shut up?

856
00:56:26,315 --> 00:56:28,681
We are building a case and it takes time.

857
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:30,079
You know that.

858
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,253
Something's wrong.

859
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,855
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

860
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,452
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:56:40,028 --> 00:56:42,759
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

862
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:44,929
No bullshit.

863
00:56:45,467 --> 00:56:48,630
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

864
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,065
You serious?

865
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:55,039
I'm afraid so.

866
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,608
Have you heard anything like that?

867
00:57:01,784 --> 00:57:03,445
Jesus Christ.

868
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,485
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:09,454
Just a little while longer.

870
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:11,923
We are this close:

871
00:57:13,996 --> 00:57:15,726
All right?

872
00:57:17,032 --> 00:57:18,762
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

873
00:57:18,934 --> 00:57:21,733
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

874
00:57:22,304 --> 00:57:24,829
But now that you're here...

875
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,905
...what do you want?

876
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:28,744
You want the truth?

877
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:32,606
Valium.

878
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,077
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:39,653
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

880
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:43,521
- ...before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:48,027
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

882
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:49,789
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

883
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,490
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

884
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,364
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

885
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:56,369
...and you're gonna close my file?

886
00:57:56,539 --> 00:58:00,168
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

887
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:02,936
- ...the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

888
00:58:03,114 --> 00:58:07,244
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

889
00:58:07,418 --> 00:58:08,407
...and what do you do?

890
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:12,646
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,556
You're fucking ridiculous.

892
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,130
Two pills?

893
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,164
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

894
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,500
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

895
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:33,666
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

896
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,244
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:58:36,414 --> 00:58:40,851
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:43,846
<i>Fuck.</i>

899
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:55,224
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

900
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,197
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,268
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

902
00:58:59,438 --> 00:59:04,534
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody that
you have to see or they put you in jail.

903
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,576
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

904
00:59:09,614 --> 00:59:11,172
What's this?

905
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,483
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

906
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:16,210
Yeah?

907
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:18,014
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:21,081
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

909
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:23,420
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:27,326
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:59:27,498 --> 00:59:31,128
You know, and too damn bad if you
don't like my initial clinical reaction.

912
00:59:31,302 --> 00:59:32,565
Thank you.

913
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:36,364
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

914
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:38,532
- Good.
- Okay.

915
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,271
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:59:49,121 --> 00:59:51,987
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

917
00:59:52,157 --> 00:59:53,521
Come on in.

918
00:59:54,626 --> 00:59:58,619
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:59:58,797 --> 01:00:00,389
Yes, those.

920
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:04,295
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
01:00:04,469 --> 01:00:06,994
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

922
01:00:07,172 --> 01:00:09,436
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

923
01:00:09,641 --> 01:00:13,202
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

924
01:00:13,378 --> 01:00:15,242
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

925
01:00:15,414 --> 01:00:18,474
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

926
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,016
Our unit will not take action.

927
01:00:20,652 --> 01:00:24,519
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:26,884
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

929
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:31,018
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:34,797
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

931
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:37,492
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,434
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
01:00:40,606 --> 01:00:42,938
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

934
01:00:43,108 --> 01:00:45,134
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

935
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:49,873
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

936
01:00:54,987 --> 01:00:57,114
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

937
01:00:57,289 --> 01:00:59,451
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

938
01:00:59,626 --> 01:01:02,117
<i>- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.</i>

939
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:04,862
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

940
01:01:05,164 --> 01:01:08,530
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
01:01:08,701 --> 01:01:10,862
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

942
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,172
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

943
01:01:18,077 --> 01:01:19,840
Your mother will be proud.

944
01:01:20,012 --> 01:01:21,876
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:24,672
The readiness is all.

946
01:01:25,451 --> 01:01:29,318
You know the players. Call the game.

947
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,251
Thank you.

948
01:01:33,492 --> 01:01:35,427
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

949
01:01:35,596 --> 01:01:38,759
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:41,661
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
01:01:41,835 --> 01:01:44,769
A confessional seal, these days...

952
01:01:44,936 --> 01:01:46,563
...I'm not so sure.

953
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:54,275
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

954
01:01:54,715 --> 01:01:56,945
All cellphone signals
are under surveillance...

955
01:01:57,117 --> 01:01:59,880
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

956
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:06,188
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

957
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:10,556
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:47,996
All right, here we go.

959
01:02:50,672 --> 01:02:52,969
There's Costello. Mr. French.

960
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:54,969
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

961
01:02:55,342 --> 01:02:57,173
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

962
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,217
Time is 10:46.

963
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,347
All right, turn off your cellphones.

964
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:13,516
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

965
01:03:36,284 --> 01:03:39,309
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

966
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:41,387
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

967
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:44,286
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

968
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:47,518
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

969
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:56,896
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

970
01:03:57,304 --> 01:04:00,934
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

971
01:04:14,657 --> 01:04:17,181
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

972
01:04:17,626 --> 01:04:20,492
Government man. Scared.

973
01:04:20,896 --> 01:04:24,592
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

974
01:04:24,766 --> 01:04:28,168
...to come to a business transaction...

975
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:30,233
...with automatic weapons.

976
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:40,047
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

977
01:04:40,215 --> 01:04:42,842
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

978
01:04:43,018 --> 01:04:46,317
Because here, in this country...

979
01:04:46,755 --> 01:04:49,280
...it don't add inches to your dick.

980
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,652
You get a life sentence for it.

981
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:12,579
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

982
01:05:12,748 --> 01:05:14,909
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cellphones.

983
01:05:15,418 --> 01:05:17,612
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

984
01:05:17,786 --> 01:05:20,186
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

985
01:05:20,355 --> 01:05:21,822
Then narrow the area.

986
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:24,550
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

987
01:05:24,726 --> 01:05:26,626
Why did they turn their phones off?

988
01:05:26,795 --> 01:05:29,764
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

989
01:05:41,945 --> 01:05:43,809
The buyers are there.

990
01:05:47,483 --> 01:05:50,851
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

991
01:05:51,019 --> 01:05:52,510
Not to my guy.

992
01:05:53,056 --> 01:05:55,786
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

993
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:57,420
Oh, who the fuck are you?

994
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,088
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

995
01:06:04,233 --> 01:06:07,567
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

996
01:06:07,737 --> 01:06:12,003
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

997
01:06:17,146 --> 01:06:20,583
What we generally do, in this country...

998
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,880
...is one guy...

999
01:06:23,186 --> 01:06:25,246
...brings the items...

1000
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,719
...and the other guy...

1001
01:06:28,023 --> 01:06:29,320
...pays him.

1002
01:06:33,061 --> 01:06:35,121
No "tickee"...

1003
01:06:35,731 --> 01:06:37,961
...no laundry.

1004
01:06:46,409 --> 01:06:48,503
Go ahead, Fitz.

1005
01:07:04,628 --> 01:07:07,619
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1006
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,391
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1007
01:07:11,568 --> 01:07:16,630
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell
me that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

1008
01:07:21,211 --> 01:07:24,146
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1009
01:07:29,987 --> 01:07:32,217
Did you put a camera in the back?

1010
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:36,153
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1011
01:07:38,496 --> 01:07:40,726
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1012
01:07:41,565 --> 01:07:43,088
You fucked this whole thing up!

1013
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:46,532
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1014
01:07:46,704 --> 01:07:49,969
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1015
01:07:50,307 --> 01:07:52,503
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1016
01:07:52,675 --> 01:07:54,905
<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>

1017
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:58,072
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1018
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,275
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1019
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:03,079
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1020
01:08:03,255 --> 01:08:06,088
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1021
01:08:06,257 --> 01:08:07,724
<i>- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.</i>

1022
01:08:07,891 --> 01:08:10,952
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1023
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:14,291
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1024
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:18,493
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1025
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:22,197
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1026
01:08:22,373 --> 01:08:26,833
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1027
01:08:27,011 --> 01:08:29,479
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1028
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:31,512
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1029
01:08:31,682 --> 01:08:34,743
<i>- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.</i>

1030
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,014
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1031
01:08:44,029 --> 01:08:47,192
...changing your life radically.

1032
01:08:47,365 --> 01:08:49,765
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1033
01:08:49,935 --> 01:08:51,960
- Right?
- Yeah.

1034
01:08:54,873 --> 01:08:57,239
How long you been with this guy?

1035
01:08:58,076 --> 01:09:00,703
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1036
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:06,613
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1037
01:09:06,786 --> 01:09:08,310
Do you love him?

1038
01:09:10,488 --> 01:09:12,957
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1039
01:09:13,123 --> 01:09:14,488
It's very serious.

1040
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:18,356
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1041
01:09:18,965 --> 01:09:20,989
No more than I am.

1042
01:09:21,634 --> 01:09:23,625
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1043
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:26,498
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1044
01:09:26,671 --> 01:09:29,003
People have doubts and problems.

1045
01:09:29,475 --> 01:09:33,137
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1046
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,645
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1047
01:09:44,657 --> 01:09:48,024
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1048
01:09:48,194 --> 01:09:51,720
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1049
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,989
Right? We talked about that.

1050
01:09:59,537 --> 01:10:01,506
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1051
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:04,099
Want a French doughnut?

1052
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:06,077
Yeah.

1053
01:10:07,512 --> 01:10:09,104
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

1054
01:10:09,515 --> 01:10:10,743
Sure.

1055
01:10:13,386 --> 01:10:16,014
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1056
01:10:16,188 --> 01:10:18,349
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1057
01:10:18,824 --> 01:10:20,292
Look, I respect who you are...

1058
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:22,619
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1059
01:10:22,796 --> 01:10:24,387
We might have company.

1060
01:10:24,563 --> 01:10:26,554
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1061
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,701
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1062
01:10:30,871 --> 01:10:34,568
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1063
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:35,930
Yeah?

1064
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:39,042
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1065
01:10:39,212 --> 01:10:42,738
Because I believe in public service.

1066
01:10:44,516 --> 01:10:47,884
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1067
01:10:48,654 --> 01:10:51,122
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

1068
01:10:51,856 --> 01:10:54,417
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1069
01:10:54,594 --> 01:10:56,288
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1070
01:10:56,462 --> 01:10:57,930
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1071
01:10:58,198 --> 01:11:00,324
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1072
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,694
You live here now. You're a resident.

1073
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:06,399
Mayor Sullivan's office.

1074
01:11:06,573 --> 01:11:09,371
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

1075
01:11:09,842 --> 01:11:11,140
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:11,311 --> 01:11:12,836
What?

1077
01:11:13,313 --> 01:11:15,439
I think it's a guy with...

1078
01:11:15,614 --> 01:11:19,608
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1079
01:11:19,786 --> 01:11:22,948
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1080
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:26,155
Something for work.

1081
01:11:26,326 --> 01:11:30,194
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

1082
01:11:30,398 --> 01:11:32,662
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1083
01:11:32,832 --> 01:11:35,461
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

1084
01:11:35,635 --> 01:11:37,329
<i>- Yeah.
- She moved in.</i>

1085
01:11:37,503 --> 01:11:41,234
- You better get organized, quick.
- Last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1086
01:11:41,408 --> 01:11:43,238
...and you're not in jail.

1087
01:11:43,409 --> 01:11:46,810
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1088
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:50,712
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1089
01:11:53,421 --> 01:11:54,786
Yes. Yes, I do.

1090
01:11:54,956 --> 01:11:56,582
So earn it.

1091
01:11:57,457 --> 01:11:59,516
I'm getting the feeling...

1092
01:11:59,693 --> 01:12:01,592
...we got a cop in my crew.

1093
01:12:01,895 --> 01:12:04,296
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1094
01:12:04,465 --> 01:12:07,262
He's one of yours. Inside.

1095
01:12:07,434 --> 01:12:08,525
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

1096
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:12,297
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1097
01:12:12,472 --> 01:12:13,667
<i>- Doing my best.
- Your best?</i>

1098
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:16,707
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1099
01:12:16,877 --> 01:12:18,435
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1100
01:12:18,613 --> 01:12:22,480
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All
right? Now, what I need you to do...

1101
01:12:22,649 --> 01:12:26,108
<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>

1102
01:12:26,287 --> 01:12:28,220
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

1103
01:12:28,389 --> 01:12:32,552
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1104
01:12:32,726 --> 01:12:35,992
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:36,163 --> 01:12:39,360
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1106
01:12:39,533 --> 01:12:44,061
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1107
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:46,034
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

1108
01:12:46,207 --> 01:12:48,641
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1109
01:12:48,809 --> 01:12:51,003
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1110
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,908
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

1111
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:56,243
<i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

1112
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:59,716
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1113
01:12:59,886 --> 01:13:02,377
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1114
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:11,564
How are you, Francis?

1115
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:20,229
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1116
01:13:20,408 --> 01:13:23,207
And your father called you the tumor.

1117
01:13:23,377 --> 01:13:26,038
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1118
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:30,207
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

1119
01:13:30,385 --> 01:13:32,511
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1120
01:13:32,688 --> 01:13:36,590
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1121
01:13:36,757 --> 01:13:38,748
You're lying to me.

1122
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:41,894
Not exactly.

1123
01:13:42,064 --> 01:13:45,521
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1124
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:48,663
Microprocessors.

1125
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:50,399
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:13:50,572 --> 01:13:53,734
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1127
01:13:53,908 --> 01:13:57,242
...at the border carrying some
light sockets or something.

1128
01:13:58,948 --> 01:14:01,780
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1129
01:14:02,452 --> 01:14:05,113
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

1130
01:14:05,287 --> 01:14:09,246
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1131
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:14,391
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1132
01:14:14,564 --> 01:14:16,588
...or your life.

1133
01:14:17,567 --> 01:14:20,559
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1134
01:14:21,203 --> 01:14:22,932
Okay, then just say that.

1135
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,386
All right, I will.

1136
01:14:27,023 --> 01:14:29,184
Oh, that's the movers.

1137
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:31,122
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1138
01:14:32,094 --> 01:14:34,255
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1139
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:38,060
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1140
01:14:38,502 --> 01:14:40,470
I'm gonna get you.

1141
01:14:41,671 --> 01:14:44,503
If you could've, you would've.

1142
01:14:44,774 --> 01:14:48,336
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1143
01:14:48,511 --> 01:14:52,881
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1144
01:15:00,923 --> 01:15:01,912
<i>Frankie.</i>

1145
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:04,326
<i>Frankie!</i>

1146
01:15:05,194 --> 01:15:07,287
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

1147
01:15:12,068 --> 01:15:13,932
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1148
01:15:14,104 --> 01:15:16,128
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1149
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:19,139
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1150
01:15:19,309 --> 01:15:23,712
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1151
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,371
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1152
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:31,345
My God, is that French out there?

1153
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,681
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1154
01:15:33,858 --> 01:15:35,792
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1155
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:38,949
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1156
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:42,895
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1157
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:45,328
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1158
01:15:45,502 --> 01:15:49,404
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1159
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,229
Fuck!

1160
01:15:51,408 --> 01:15:54,707
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1161
01:15:54,878 --> 01:15:58,837
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1162
01:15:59,015 --> 01:16:01,506
He'll trade you out.

1163
01:16:01,886 --> 01:16:04,582
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1164
01:16:04,755 --> 01:16:07,849
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1165
01:16:08,024 --> 01:16:11,016
It fucking hurts!

1166
01:16:18,536 --> 01:16:20,765
Hey. It's me.

1167
01:16:20,938 --> 01:16:23,270
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1168
01:16:25,475 --> 01:16:28,239
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1169
01:16:28,412 --> 01:16:32,712
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1170
01:16:32,884 --> 01:16:35,250
He's a protected fucking informant.

1171
01:16:35,418 --> 01:16:39,650
I mean, aren't they always trying to make
it a federal case and it never gets made?

1172
01:16:40,824 --> 01:16:43,453
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1173
01:16:47,164 --> 01:16:50,532
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1174
01:16:55,605 --> 01:16:57,301
That's my son, Patrick.

1175
01:16:57,609 --> 01:17:00,737
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1176
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:04,279
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1177
01:17:04,448 --> 01:17:05,938
No. No, thanks.

1178
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:09,712
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1179
01:17:09,887 --> 01:17:11,515
Come on.

1180
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:48,287
You want some coke?

1181
01:17:53,832 --> 01:17:55,731
There it is.

1182
01:17:56,368 --> 01:17:58,859
Don't move till you're numb.

1183
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:15,819
Come on. Get inside.

1184
01:18:18,157 --> 01:18:19,988
Boss wants your real name...

1185
01:18:20,693 --> 01:18:23,685
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1186
01:18:23,862 --> 01:18:25,954
I don't have a bank account.

1187
01:18:26,131 --> 01:18:29,328
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1188
01:18:29,502 --> 01:18:33,438
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your
real name and all your account numbers.

1189
01:18:33,605 --> 01:18:35,436
Then we wait here.

1190
01:18:36,274 --> 01:18:39,005
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1191
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:52,516
Put the forms in there.

1192
01:18:56,029 --> 01:18:58,395
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1193
01:18:58,564 --> 01:19:01,226
But fuck it, you know?

1194
01:19:01,734 --> 01:19:04,202
No, no, no. Come here.

1195
01:19:09,175 --> 01:19:11,166
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1196
01:19:11,344 --> 01:19:13,505
That ain't fucking right.

1197
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:14,940
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:19:15,113 --> 01:19:16,411
Look at this. Look.

1199
01:19:17,182 --> 01:19:19,173
"Citizens." Look.

1200
01:19:19,519 --> 01:19:20,850
Billy, he said to stay here.

1201
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,744
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1202
01:19:23,922 --> 01:19:25,287
Where the fuck are you going?

1203
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:29,622
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1204
01:19:48,948 --> 01:19:50,974
- Hey.
- Hi.

1205
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,078
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1206
01:20:01,994 --> 01:20:03,859
Look...

1207
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:05,793
- ...if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.

1208
01:20:05,966 --> 01:20:08,594
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1209
01:20:11,438 --> 01:20:13,405
So you moving out or you moving in?

1210
01:20:14,173 --> 01:20:16,335
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1211
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:27,180
That's me.

1212
01:20:30,257 --> 01:20:31,747
Yeah, I know.

1213
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:41,529
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1214
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:43,301
You have to choose.

1215
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:46,131
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

1216
01:20:46,306 --> 01:20:49,707
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1217
01:20:49,877 --> 01:20:52,141
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1218
01:20:52,311 --> 01:20:54,905
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1219
01:20:55,849 --> 01:20:58,750
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1220
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:14,796
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1221
01:21:20,007 --> 01:21:21,668
Is it real?

1222
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:27,309
I think so.

1223
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:35,086
You don't have any cats.

1224
01:21:35,256 --> 01:21:36,814
No.

1225
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,555
I like that.

1226
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:53,060
I don't get it.

1227
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:58,599
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1228
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:01,938
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1229
01:23:02,112 --> 01:23:06,344
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1230
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:10,680
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1231
01:23:10,854 --> 01:23:14,118
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1232
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:17,623
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1233
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:19,261
I have an immaculate record.

1234
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:22,394
How is your wedding coming along?

1235
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,998
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1236
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:27,935
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1237
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:30,229
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1238
01:23:30,407 --> 01:23:33,307
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1239
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:36,137
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1240
01:23:36,313 --> 01:23:40,373
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1241
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,618
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1242
01:23:44,054 --> 01:23:46,783
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1243
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:38,534
Be dirty, be dirty.

1244
01:24:40,711 --> 01:24:42,905
Yeah...

1245
01:24:48,118 --> 01:24:50,849
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1246
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,747
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1247
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,824
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1248
01:24:57,994 --> 01:25:02,055
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1249
01:25:02,432 --> 01:25:04,127
You're not cracking up, are you?

1250
01:25:05,069 --> 01:25:07,628
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1251
01:25:07,805 --> 01:25:09,704
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1252
01:25:09,873 --> 01:25:13,037
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1253
01:25:13,644 --> 01:25:15,305
I own the place.

1254
01:25:17,614 --> 01:25:20,208
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1255
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:25,283
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1256
01:25:25,989 --> 01:25:27,457
How the fuck do you know that?

1257
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:29,922
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1258
01:25:30,095 --> 01:25:33,655
I gotta find myself.

1259
01:25:33,832 --> 01:25:35,423
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1260
01:25:36,033 --> 01:25:38,432
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1261
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:42,798
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1262
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:45,032
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1263
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:49,646
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1264
01:25:49,814 --> 01:25:51,645
- Right now.
- Collie...

1265
01:25:51,815 --> 01:25:54,216
...laying low is not what I do.

1266
01:25:54,386 --> 01:25:57,047
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1267
01:25:57,221 --> 01:25:59,452
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1268
01:25:59,622 --> 01:26:01,215
What good am I if you don't listen?

1269
01:26:06,363 --> 01:26:09,162
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1270
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:10,994
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1271
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:14,762
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1272
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:19,470
Okay.

1273
01:26:23,314 --> 01:26:26,181
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1274
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:30,377
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1275
01:26:30,555 --> 01:26:34,787
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1276
01:26:35,726 --> 01:26:38,217
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1277
01:26:38,396 --> 01:26:43,561
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1278
01:26:43,734 --> 01:26:46,168
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1279
01:26:46,706 --> 01:26:49,072
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1280
01:26:50,309 --> 01:26:54,871
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1281
01:26:55,046 --> 01:26:56,707
Right?

1282
01:26:56,881 --> 01:26:59,510
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1283
01:26:59,684 --> 01:27:04,314
...for me to get cunt that I never
understood jerking off in a theater.

1284
01:27:10,828 --> 01:27:12,386
Christ.

1285
01:27:14,533 --> 01:27:17,059
Who knows what's easy?

1286
01:27:17,837 --> 01:27:22,501
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1287
01:28:07,252 --> 01:28:08,720
Shit!

1288
01:28:47,627 --> 01:28:49,060
Fuck.

1289
01:30:07,207 --> 01:30:08,697
Hey, how you doing?

1290
01:30:08,876 --> 01:30:11,037
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1291
01:30:15,216 --> 01:30:17,081
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1292
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:18,945
Have a good one.

1293
01:30:42,077 --> 01:30:44,238
I smell a rat.

1294
01:30:50,885 --> 01:30:52,113
Jesus Christ.

1295
01:30:53,188 --> 01:30:54,779
You got a girlfriend?

1296
01:30:56,725 --> 01:30:58,386
No.

1297
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,618
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1298
01:31:02,363 --> 01:31:03,729
It depends.

1299
01:31:05,934 --> 01:31:09,563
I'm sure by now you know...

1300
01:31:10,171 --> 01:31:13,300
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1301
01:31:14,275 --> 01:31:15,503
Cop.

1302
01:31:15,676 --> 01:31:20,944
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1303
01:31:21,115 --> 01:31:23,277
Jesus Christ.

1304
01:31:24,886 --> 01:31:27,515
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1305
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:31,858
It ain't the FBI.

1306
01:31:32,895 --> 01:31:34,828
Ex-wife.

1307
01:31:36,131 --> 01:31:38,189
Old girlfriend.

1308
01:31:39,568 --> 01:31:41,502
Or stupid.

1309
01:31:42,671 --> 01:31:46,037
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1310
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:47,904
Stupid, huh?

1311
01:31:48,577 --> 01:31:50,476
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1312
01:31:54,716 --> 01:32:00,086
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1313
01:32:00,823 --> 01:32:03,256
Everybody who works for me.

1314
01:32:03,725 --> 01:32:06,023
Right. You know, Frank...

1315
01:32:06,195 --> 01:32:08,288
...I look around at your other guys...

1316
01:32:09,097 --> 01:32:12,033
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1317
01:32:12,702 --> 01:32:15,864
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1318
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:21,104
And all I can answer myself is:

1319
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:24,636
"What's the difference?"

1320
01:32:25,381 --> 01:32:27,712
Give them up to the Almighty.

1321
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,947
You see, that's my point, you know?

1322
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:36,215
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1323
01:32:36,391 --> 01:32:37,722
You accuse me twice...

1324
01:32:39,362 --> 01:32:41,261
...I quit.

1325
01:32:41,864 --> 01:32:46,268
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1326
01:32:46,435 --> 01:32:49,371
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1327
01:33:00,515 --> 01:33:04,179
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1328
01:33:06,323 --> 01:33:10,350
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1329
01:33:11,226 --> 01:33:13,524
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1330
01:33:13,697 --> 01:33:16,029
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:33:16,198 --> 01:33:18,497
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1332
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:22,262
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1333
01:33:22,439 --> 01:33:24,565
I haven't needed the money...

1334
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:28,871
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1335
01:33:29,046 --> 01:33:32,310
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1336
01:33:33,783 --> 01:33:35,614
But I like it.

1337
01:33:36,787 --> 01:33:39,551
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1338
01:33:39,721 --> 01:33:42,555
...I got this rat...

1339
01:33:42,725 --> 01:33:47,024
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1340
01:33:47,195 --> 01:33:49,595
...and it brings up questions.

1341
01:33:49,766 --> 01:33:53,760
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1342
01:33:55,003 --> 01:33:56,835
Girlfriend...

1343
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:03,543
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1344
01:34:04,314 --> 01:34:06,976
Social-security numbers.

1345
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:10,086
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1346
01:34:10,253 --> 01:34:13,051
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1347
01:34:13,222 --> 01:34:15,622
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1348
01:34:15,792 --> 01:34:17,726
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1349
01:34:17,895 --> 01:34:21,194
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1350
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:22,764
I'm not the fucking rat.

1351
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:26,198
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1352
01:34:27,104 --> 01:34:28,627
You said there is one, all right?

1353
01:34:28,805 --> 01:34:32,332
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1354
01:34:32,509 --> 01:34:34,601
Sure. Sure, Will.

1355
01:34:34,778 --> 01:34:39,271
You, William. What would you do?

1356
01:34:44,287 --> 01:34:45,811
Frank, how many of these guys...

1357
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:48,390
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1358
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,529
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1359
01:34:51,694 --> 01:34:54,663
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1360
01:34:54,832 --> 01:34:58,359
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1361
01:34:59,203 --> 01:35:03,697
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1362
01:35:04,641 --> 01:35:07,805
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1363
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:12,515
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1364
01:35:15,019 --> 01:35:17,043
You wanna be me?

1365
01:35:20,759 --> 01:35:23,421
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1366
01:35:23,595 --> 01:35:25,085
Yeah, I know that much.

1367
01:35:26,398 --> 01:35:29,457
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1368
01:35:29,634 --> 01:35:31,898
I don't wanna be you.

1369
01:35:32,904 --> 01:35:37,841
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1370
01:35:38,344 --> 01:35:39,777
Yeah.

1371
01:35:40,612 --> 01:35:43,079
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

1372
01:35:43,247 --> 01:35:47,344
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1373
01:35:49,854 --> 01:35:52,721
You know what I like about restaurants?

1374
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:54,756
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1375
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:59,162
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1376
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:03,731
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1377
01:36:04,703 --> 01:36:07,536
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1378
01:36:07,704 --> 01:36:10,868
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1379
01:36:15,046 --> 01:36:20,279
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1380
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,384
I got it. Okay?

1381
01:36:25,757 --> 01:36:27,315
Excuse me...

1382
01:36:27,493 --> 01:36:30,154
- ...French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1383
01:36:30,328 --> 01:36:31,318
...cigarette.

1384
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:36,631
Eat something.

1385
01:36:45,277 --> 01:36:46,265
Problem?

1386
01:36:46,444 --> 01:36:49,971
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1387
01:36:50,149 --> 01:36:52,481
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1388
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:54,778
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1389
01:36:54,953 --> 01:36:58,480
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1390
01:36:58,657 --> 01:37:02,217
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1391
01:37:02,395 --> 01:37:03,384
Fucking prick.

1392
01:37:03,796 --> 01:37:06,787
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1393
01:37:06,966 --> 01:37:09,297
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1394
01:37:09,636 --> 01:37:12,969
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1395
01:37:13,739 --> 01:37:16,333
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1396
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:20,871
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1397
01:37:22,614 --> 01:37:25,515
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1398
01:37:27,853 --> 01:37:31,118
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1399
01:37:31,289 --> 01:37:34,054
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1400
01:37:34,226 --> 01:37:35,454
No.

1401
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:40,832
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1402
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,297
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1403
01:37:45,471 --> 01:37:47,337
...who is here in SIU.

1404
01:37:49,109 --> 01:37:51,475
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1405
01:37:59,118 --> 01:38:01,747
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

1406
01:38:01,954 --> 01:38:06,186
<i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i>

1407
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:11,161
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

1408
01:38:12,599 --> 01:38:14,590
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

1409
01:38:17,537 --> 01:38:20,769
<i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

1410
01:38:21,408 --> 01:38:24,344
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1411
01:38:24,944 --> 01:38:27,105
...I'd be through it in a year.

1412
01:38:28,414 --> 01:38:30,314
If I wasn't a trooper.

1413
01:38:34,621 --> 01:38:37,453
But another city. I was thinking that.

1414
01:38:38,692 --> 01:38:40,421
Another city.

1415
01:38:40,661 --> 01:38:42,993
Another city, huh?

1416
01:38:44,497 --> 01:38:47,626
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1417
01:38:48,168 --> 01:38:51,434
<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>

1418
01:38:53,774 --> 01:38:55,570
If we're not gonna make it...

1419
01:38:55,743 --> 01:39:00,203
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1420
01:39:01,515 --> 01:39:05,849
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1421
01:39:14,628 --> 01:39:18,462
<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>

1422
01:39:36,716 --> 01:39:39,480
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1423
01:39:39,654 --> 01:39:42,680
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1424
01:39:42,856 --> 01:39:46,122
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1425
01:39:46,295 --> 01:39:47,283
Yeah.

1426
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:51,158
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1427
01:39:51,798 --> 01:39:54,631
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1428
01:40:00,574 --> 01:40:02,542
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1429
01:40:05,113 --> 01:40:07,842
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1430
01:40:09,618 --> 01:40:11,949
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1431
01:40:12,119 --> 01:40:14,417
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1432
01:40:25,934 --> 01:40:29,961
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1433
01:40:31,707 --> 01:40:36,337
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1434
01:40:36,511 --> 01:40:40,708
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1435
01:40:41,483 --> 01:40:44,042
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1436
01:40:45,052 --> 01:40:47,145
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1437
01:40:47,322 --> 01:40:49,619
- ...and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1438
01:40:52,027 --> 01:40:53,654
You're a cop.

1439
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,461
What?

1440
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:57,756
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1441
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,530
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

1442
01:41:03,971 --> 01:41:07,100
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1443
01:41:07,274 --> 01:41:09,208
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1444
01:41:16,051 --> 01:41:19,112
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1445
01:41:19,287 --> 01:41:22,484
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1446
01:41:22,657 --> 01:41:25,956
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1447
01:41:26,128 --> 01:41:27,561
<i>- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.</i>

1448
01:41:27,729 --> 01:41:30,095
<i>- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.</i>

1449
01:41:30,265 --> 01:41:33,722
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1450
01:41:33,903 --> 01:41:37,668
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1451
01:41:39,542 --> 01:41:41,168
It ain't Bill.

1452
01:41:41,344 --> 01:41:43,106
No way, he says.

1453
01:41:55,625 --> 01:41:57,990
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1454
01:41:58,162 --> 01:41:59,685
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1455
01:41:59,862 --> 01:42:04,265
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1456
01:42:05,301 --> 01:42:06,996
Good. Thank you.

1457
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:13,775
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1458
01:42:13,944 --> 01:42:15,844
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1459
01:42:16,011 --> 01:42:19,175
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1460
01:42:19,347 --> 01:42:23,113
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1461
01:42:23,286 --> 01:42:25,277
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1462
01:42:25,456 --> 01:42:28,983
<i>- I just don't like it. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...</i>

1463
01:42:29,158 --> 01:42:31,889
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1464
01:42:32,061 --> 01:42:34,359
So just follow him and don't get made.

1465
01:42:37,701 --> 01:42:40,568
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1466
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:18,268
Hey. Where are you?

1467
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:20,409
<i>Look down the car.</i>

1468
01:43:21,813 --> 01:43:24,280
<i>- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.</i>

1469
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:26,313
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1470
01:43:26,817 --> 01:43:28,216
No.

1471
01:43:29,854 --> 01:43:32,686
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1472
01:43:34,024 --> 01:43:37,654
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1473
01:43:37,828 --> 01:43:40,092
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1474
01:44:16,033 --> 01:44:19,230
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1475
01:44:19,404 --> 01:44:21,929
You got that? 344 Wash.

1476
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:27,738
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1477
01:44:32,317 --> 01:44:34,979
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1478
01:44:36,487 --> 01:44:39,786
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

1479
01:44:40,625 --> 01:44:42,114
He's getting spooky, captain.

1480
01:44:42,292 --> 01:44:43,418
- What?
- I just saw him.

1481
01:44:43,595 --> 01:44:46,119
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1482
01:44:52,704 --> 01:44:55,139
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1483
01:44:55,773 --> 01:44:58,742
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1484
01:44:58,909 --> 01:45:02,436
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1485
01:45:02,613 --> 01:45:04,945
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1486
01:45:11,789 --> 01:45:14,759
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

1487
01:45:14,926 --> 01:45:16,621
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1488
01:45:16,795 --> 01:45:19,592
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1489
01:45:19,765 --> 01:45:23,029
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1490
01:45:24,103 --> 01:45:25,161
Yeah?

1491
01:45:25,337 --> 01:45:28,033
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1492
01:45:28,207 --> 01:45:30,538
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1493
01:45:30,708 --> 01:45:32,141
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1494
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:37,341
<i>- Yeah.
- Where are you?</i>

1495
01:45:37,515 --> 01:45:39,814
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1496
01:45:40,284 --> 01:45:42,275
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>

1497
01:45:42,453 --> 01:45:45,047
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1498
01:45:45,224 --> 01:45:46,657
All right, we'll see you there.

1499
01:45:47,192 --> 01:45:48,420
- What?
- You were followed.

1500
01:45:48,594 --> 01:45:50,185
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1501
01:45:50,362 --> 01:45:51,795
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1502
01:45:51,963 --> 01:45:54,694
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1503
01:45:55,667 --> 01:45:57,192
Come on!

1504
01:46:03,841 --> 01:46:06,310
What the fuck is going on?

1505
01:46:07,412 --> 01:46:10,246
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

1506
01:46:11,149 --> 01:46:13,583
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1507
01:46:13,752 --> 01:46:17,051
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

1508
01:46:21,994 --> 01:46:24,828
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1509
01:46:28,902 --> 01:46:30,698
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1510
01:46:30,868 --> 01:46:32,699
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1511
01:46:32,872 --> 01:46:35,898
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1512
01:46:53,525 --> 01:46:56,086
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1513
01:46:56,261 --> 01:46:59,287
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1514
01:46:59,466 --> 01:47:01,559
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1515
01:47:01,734 --> 01:47:03,760
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:47:20,086 --> 01:47:23,078
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1517
01:47:27,426 --> 01:47:29,452
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1518
01:47:30,262 --> 01:47:32,322
What the fuck?

1519
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,390
Fuck.

1520
01:47:36,569 --> 01:47:38,470
What do you mean,
off the building?

1521
01:47:38,637 --> 01:47:41,333
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1522
01:47:50,048 --> 01:47:51,948
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1523
01:47:52,118 --> 01:47:54,882
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1524
01:47:55,488 --> 01:47:56,979
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1525
01:47:57,158 --> 01:47:58,954
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1526
01:47:59,126 --> 01:48:00,490
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1527
01:48:00,661 --> 01:48:02,322
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1528
01:48:02,494 --> 01:48:04,019
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

1529
01:48:04,198 --> 01:48:07,132
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1530
01:48:07,301 --> 01:48:09,359
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1531
01:48:09,537 --> 01:48:11,663
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1532
01:48:11,838 --> 01:48:13,203
What came off the roof?

1533
01:48:13,373 --> 01:48:14,863
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1534
01:48:15,042 --> 01:48:16,805
Fuck this.

1535
01:48:24,885 --> 01:48:26,511
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1536
01:48:28,021 --> 01:48:30,957
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1537
01:48:31,125 --> 01:48:32,752
All right. I got him.

1538
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:41,395
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1539
01:48:41,569 --> 01:48:44,970
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

1540
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:47,164
<i>Send some back...</i>

1541
01:49:04,525 --> 01:49:07,689
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1542
01:49:07,863 --> 01:49:09,694
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1543
01:49:09,864 --> 01:49:12,025
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1544
01:49:12,199 --> 01:49:14,930
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1545
01:49:15,103 --> 01:49:17,502
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1546
01:49:18,404 --> 01:49:20,065
Fucking piece of shit!

1547
01:49:20,242 --> 01:49:21,731
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1548
01:49:21,909 --> 01:49:23,274
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1549
01:49:23,444 --> 01:49:26,608
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1550
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:28,942
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1551
01:49:29,117 --> 01:49:31,346
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1552
01:49:31,519 --> 01:49:34,920
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1553
01:49:35,090 --> 01:49:36,181
That's a fucking lie.

1554
01:49:36,358 --> 01:49:39,918
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1555
01:49:40,095 --> 01:49:41,686
I need access to those files.

1556
01:49:41,863 --> 01:49:44,890
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1557
01:49:45,065 --> 01:49:47,193
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1558
01:49:47,368 --> 01:49:50,167
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1559
01:49:50,337 --> 01:49:53,204
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1560
01:49:53,376 --> 01:49:56,310
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1561
01:49:56,478 --> 01:49:58,844
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1562
01:49:59,014 --> 01:50:02,414
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1563
01:50:02,583 --> 01:50:04,051
Good.

1564
01:50:05,887 --> 01:50:07,479
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1565
01:50:09,425 --> 01:50:11,256
- I need those codes.
- No.

1566
01:50:11,426 --> 01:50:13,552
You want those codes.

1567
01:50:16,666 --> 01:50:18,395
So where the fuck were you?

1568
01:50:20,069 --> 01:50:22,628
Well, boss told me to go home.

1569
01:50:22,804 --> 01:50:27,002
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

1570
01:50:27,176 --> 01:50:28,643
So where the fuck were you?

1571
01:50:29,244 --> 01:50:32,145
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1572
01:50:32,314 --> 01:50:34,305
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1573
01:50:34,481 --> 01:50:37,507
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1574
01:50:37,686 --> 01:50:39,746
Billy. Billy.

1575
01:50:46,127 --> 01:50:47,652
Yeah?

1576
01:50:49,865 --> 01:50:51,856
Yeah?

1577
01:50:52,335 --> 01:50:54,496
You know what I thought today?

1578
01:50:56,305 --> 01:50:58,000
What's that?

1579
01:50:59,007 --> 01:51:02,466
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1580
01:51:05,948 --> 01:51:07,313
Yeah?

1581
01:51:08,350 --> 01:51:12,150
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1582
01:51:14,055 --> 01:51:16,286
When I called you...

1583
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:18,689
...I made a mistake.

1584
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:22,661
I gave you the wrong address...

1585
01:51:22,832 --> 01:51:26,666
...but you showed up at the right one...

1586
01:51:27,136 --> 01:51:29,036
...didn't you?

1587
01:51:30,305 --> 01:51:32,865
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1588
01:51:34,143 --> 01:51:35,474
Tell me why.

1589
01:51:58,368 --> 01:52:01,769
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1590
01:52:01,936 --> 01:52:03,734
He's dead.

1591
01:52:03,907 --> 01:52:05,533
I'm going home.

1592
01:52:05,708 --> 01:52:08,506
<i>- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.</i>

1593
01:52:08,677 --> 01:52:10,703
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1594
01:52:10,881 --> 01:52:12,347
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1595
01:52:12,515 --> 01:52:15,712
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1596
01:52:15,886 --> 01:52:18,547
<i>- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.</i>

1597
01:52:18,721 --> 01:52:20,189
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

1598
01:52:20,356 --> 01:52:24,417
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1599
01:52:24,594 --> 01:52:26,027
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

1600
01:52:26,195 --> 01:52:29,859
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1601
01:52:30,033 --> 01:52:32,091
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

1602
01:52:32,269 --> 01:52:35,931
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1603
01:52:37,608 --> 01:52:39,269
Sweetheart.

1604
01:52:39,443 --> 01:52:41,637
You're giving me a hard-on.

1605
01:52:42,244 --> 01:52:43,644
Are you sure it's me?

1606
01:52:44,148 --> 01:52:47,412
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1607
01:52:47,885 --> 01:52:49,876
Watch your fucking mouth.

1608
01:52:50,052 --> 01:52:52,487
No. You watch it.

1609
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:55,488
Let me straighten you out.

1610
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:06,268
I tried to call you a few times.

1611
01:53:09,474 --> 01:53:11,237
I know.

1612
01:53:37,636 --> 01:53:41,537
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1613
01:53:46,676 --> 01:53:48,577
I'm sorry.

1614
01:53:55,051 --> 01:53:56,780
Yeah...

1615
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:02,987
...I know.

1616
01:56:11,623 --> 01:56:13,113
Yeah.

1617
01:56:13,926 --> 01:56:17,157
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1618
01:56:17,597 --> 01:56:19,155
Who are you?

1619
01:56:19,399 --> 01:56:21,662
So it is you.

1620
01:56:22,868 --> 01:56:25,860
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1621
01:56:27,273 --> 01:56:28,899
Who are you?

1622
01:56:29,809 --> 01:56:31,833
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1623
01:56:32,011 --> 01:56:33,774
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1624
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:36,505
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1625
01:56:36,684 --> 01:56:38,015
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

1626
01:56:38,184 --> 01:56:41,381
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1627
01:56:41,555 --> 01:56:43,750
We're all very upset.

1628
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:47,154
<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>

1629
01:56:48,127 --> 01:56:51,029
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1630
01:56:52,498 --> 01:56:53,488
<i>We'll meet...</i>

1631
01:57:32,673 --> 01:57:34,971
<i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i>

1632
01:57:35,141 --> 01:57:37,109
<i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i>

1633
01:57:37,278 --> 01:57:40,270
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

1634
01:57:40,448 --> 01:57:42,939
<i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i>

1635
01:57:43,117 --> 01:57:46,086
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

1636
01:57:46,252 --> 01:57:47,810
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

1637
01:57:47,988 --> 01:57:50,389
<i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>

1638
01:57:50,556 --> 01:57:54,015
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1639
01:57:54,261 --> 01:57:57,719
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1640
01:57:57,898 --> 01:57:59,832
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1641
01:58:00,001 --> 01:58:02,628
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1642
01:58:02,802 --> 01:58:04,963
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1643
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:07,266
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1644
01:58:07,442 --> 01:58:09,671
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1645
01:58:10,042 --> 01:58:11,340
I'm embarrassed.

1646
01:58:12,012 --> 01:58:14,675
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1647
01:58:14,849 --> 01:58:19,377
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1648
01:58:19,753 --> 01:58:21,948
...so I won't look for the cop.

1649
01:58:23,224 --> 01:58:24,850
Are you soft, Fitz?

1650
01:58:25,025 --> 01:58:29,985
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1651
01:58:30,164 --> 01:58:33,100
...you dump him in the marsh.

1652
01:58:34,135 --> 01:58:37,434
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1653
01:58:37,605 --> 01:58:39,698
...to get a fucking blowjob!

1654
01:58:40,475 --> 01:58:42,636
Don't laugh!

1655
01:58:43,478 --> 01:58:46,378
This ain't reality TV!

1656
01:58:50,318 --> 01:58:52,081
Proceed.

1657
01:59:14,542 --> 01:59:16,009
- What?
- Yeah.

1658
01:59:16,177 --> 01:59:18,942
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1659
01:59:19,113 --> 01:59:22,675
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1660
01:59:22,851 --> 01:59:23,978
So get rid of them.

1661
01:59:24,153 --> 01:59:27,247
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1662
01:59:27,422 --> 01:59:29,653
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1663
01:59:34,596 --> 01:59:36,154
All right.

1664
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:45,667
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1665
01:59:45,841 --> 01:59:48,639
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1666
02:00:04,961 --> 02:00:08,293
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1667
02:00:08,465 --> 02:00:10,831
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1668
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,662
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1669
02:00:13,868 --> 02:00:15,234
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

1670
02:00:15,404 --> 02:00:18,065
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1671
02:00:18,239 --> 02:00:21,175
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1672
02:00:21,377 --> 02:00:23,845
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1673
02:00:24,014 --> 02:00:26,175
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1674
02:00:26,347 --> 02:00:28,782
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1675
02:00:28,952 --> 02:00:31,944
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1676
02:00:52,309 --> 02:00:54,368
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1677
02:00:54,543 --> 02:00:57,137
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1678
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:22,962
Load it.

1679
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:33,279
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1680
02:01:34,551 --> 02:01:36,519
Were you not in the fucking car?

1681
02:01:36,686 --> 02:01:39,747
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1682
02:01:42,958 --> 02:01:44,756
Load.

1683
02:01:52,336 --> 02:01:54,167
Go, go!

1684
02:01:56,606 --> 02:01:58,164
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1685
02:02:00,243 --> 02:02:02,371
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1686
02:02:02,546 --> 02:02:06,003
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1687
02:02:15,025 --> 02:02:17,460
Cocksuckers.

1688
02:02:23,466 --> 02:02:26,027
Motherfucking shit!

1689
02:02:29,474 --> 02:02:31,135
Motherfucking...!

1690
02:02:34,545 --> 02:02:36,809
Back the fuck up!

1691
02:02:36,981 --> 02:02:39,074
They fucking shot me.

1692
02:02:42,787 --> 02:02:43,912
Get down!

1693
02:02:46,923 --> 02:02:48,481
Come on, fucking bastards!

1694
02:03:07,212 --> 02:03:08,679
Fuck it.

1695
02:03:48,119 --> 02:03:51,886
How the fuck did this happen?

1696
02:03:53,292 --> 02:03:55,886
You're an FBI informant?

1697
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:58,256
Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
02:03:59,730 --> 02:04:01,426
Grow up.

1699
02:04:02,134 --> 02:04:05,069
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1700
02:04:05,238 --> 02:04:06,728
Do they know who I am?

1701
02:04:08,673 --> 02:04:13,042
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

1702
02:04:14,078 --> 02:04:16,512
Nobody knows nothing.

1703
02:04:18,115 --> 02:04:19,605
Frank.

1704
02:04:19,918 --> 02:04:22,819
Frank. Frank.

1705
02:04:22,988 --> 02:04:24,979
Do they know about me?

1706
02:04:26,692 --> 02:04:29,216
I know about you, Collie.

1707
02:04:29,395 --> 02:04:32,228
You know I'd never give you up.

1708
02:04:32,965 --> 02:04:35,729
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

1709
02:04:36,636 --> 02:04:40,002
To you? Is that what this is about?

1710
02:04:40,972 --> 02:04:45,306
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1711
02:05:07,332 --> 02:05:09,766
Fucking rat prick!

1712
02:05:31,358 --> 02:05:32,949
<i>Frank?</i>

1713
02:05:33,126 --> 02:05:34,615
Yeah?

1714
02:05:36,363 --> 02:05:37,591
Who's this?

1715
02:05:39,498 --> 02:05:41,126
Gwen?

1716
02:05:42,268 --> 02:05:44,360
Where the hell's Frank?

1717
02:05:45,438 --> 02:05:47,234
Frank got shot.

1718
02:05:50,076 --> 02:05:52,475
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1719
02:06:00,854 --> 02:06:02,480
I got him!

1720
02:06:02,655 --> 02:06:05,090
I got Costello here!

1721
02:06:09,229 --> 02:06:11,720
Hey, good job, sarge.

1722
02:06:12,498 --> 02:06:14,056
No, it's...

1723
02:06:15,469 --> 02:06:17,060
For you.

1724
02:06:18,137 --> 02:06:21,198
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1725
02:06:24,712 --> 02:06:27,943
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1726
02:06:28,148 --> 02:06:30,582
How'd you get him without the files?

1727
02:06:30,751 --> 02:06:33,548
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

1728
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:35,886
You know that guy?

1729
02:06:36,056 --> 02:06:38,923
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1730
02:06:46,365 --> 02:06:48,027
Good to see you, trooper.

1731
02:06:48,202 --> 02:06:50,863
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1732
02:06:51,037 --> 02:06:52,595
- Yeah.
- So.

1733
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:55,904
Now, how long were you undercover?

1734
02:06:56,077 --> 02:06:57,976
Long time.

1735
02:06:58,145 --> 02:06:59,975
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1736
02:07:00,381 --> 02:07:05,318
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1737
02:07:08,155 --> 02:07:11,488
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1738
02:07:11,658 --> 02:07:13,354
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1739
02:07:14,295 --> 02:07:16,661
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1740
02:07:18,699 --> 02:07:20,497
It's the highest honor we got.

1741
02:07:20,667 --> 02:07:23,466
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1742
02:07:23,637 --> 02:07:25,628
- That's all.
- All right.

1743
02:07:25,806 --> 02:07:28,707
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1744
02:07:28,876 --> 02:07:32,470
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1745
02:07:32,747 --> 02:07:35,716
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1746
02:07:35,882 --> 02:07:39,841
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1747
02:07:42,489 --> 02:07:44,787
How's that working for you?

1748
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:46,689
Is it helpful?

1749
02:07:47,427 --> 02:07:50,192
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1750
02:07:52,801 --> 02:07:56,032
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1751
02:07:56,471 --> 02:07:59,167
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1752
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:02,502
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1753
02:08:02,676 --> 02:08:06,511
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

1754
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:09,274
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1755
02:08:09,449 --> 02:08:12,010
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1756
02:08:12,186 --> 02:08:14,347
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1757
02:08:14,521 --> 02:08:16,921
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1758
02:08:17,091 --> 02:08:18,490
Fair enough.

1759
02:08:19,094 --> 02:08:23,554
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1760
02:08:25,733 --> 02:08:26,756
It's my name.

1761
02:08:27,569 --> 02:08:29,935
William Costigan Jr.

1762
02:08:30,104 --> 02:08:33,369
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1763
02:08:33,942 --> 02:08:35,876
It's your name.

1764
02:08:37,979 --> 02:08:39,378
All right.

1765
02:08:39,547 --> 02:08:42,243
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1766
02:08:42,417 --> 02:08:44,648
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1767
02:08:44,819 --> 02:08:47,083
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1768
02:08:47,256 --> 02:08:51,021
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1769
02:10:24,354 --> 02:10:28,189
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1770
02:10:59,155 --> 02:11:00,918
I know.

1771
02:11:02,458 --> 02:11:04,949
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

1772
02:11:05,228 --> 02:11:06,819
I'm not.

1773
02:11:09,033 --> 02:11:12,297
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1774
02:11:12,469 --> 02:11:14,903
Something I need you to keep.

1775
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:16,663
For me.

1776
02:11:18,943 --> 02:11:20,534
Okay?

1777
02:11:24,148 --> 02:11:28,448
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1778
02:11:28,619 --> 02:11:32,578
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1779
02:11:32,756 --> 02:11:35,317
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1780
02:11:36,927 --> 02:11:38,520
Please.

1781
02:11:42,065 --> 02:11:44,466
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

1782
02:11:44,636 --> 02:11:47,332
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1783
02:11:47,505 --> 02:11:50,770
I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1784
02:11:52,210 --> 02:11:54,371
There's no one else.

1785
02:11:55,145 --> 02:11:57,876
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1786
02:11:58,481 --> 02:12:00,449
You know, I have...

1787
02:12:00,618 --> 02:12:03,052
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1788
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:05,416
...think about it real hard, all right?

1789
02:12:05,588 --> 02:12:09,115
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1790
02:12:38,890 --> 02:12:40,823
I was dreaming I was dead.

1791
02:12:42,193 --> 02:12:46,390
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1792
02:12:47,332 --> 02:12:50,563
- What's this?
- Open it.

1793
02:12:59,411 --> 02:13:02,073
- Really?
- Yeah.

1794
02:13:03,113 --> 02:13:04,581
Really?

1795
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:06,774
Yeah.

1796
02:13:06,951 --> 02:13:10,511
And they say
that this little speck...

1797
02:13:10,689 --> 02:13:12,884
...is a penis.

1798
02:13:16,162 --> 02:13:18,027
It's a boy.

1799
02:13:18,195 --> 02:13:20,993
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1800
02:13:22,501 --> 02:13:24,492
Can you still...?

1801
02:14:15,054 --> 02:14:17,045
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

1802
02:14:17,222 --> 02:14:21,421
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i>

1803
02:14:21,594 --> 02:14:25,256
<i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i>

1804
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:28,264
<i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i>

1805
02:14:28,435 --> 02:14:33,737
<i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

1806
02:14:33,905 --> 02:14:37,103
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i>

1807
02:14:37,275 --> 02:14:39,641
<i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i>

1808
02:14:39,813 --> 02:14:43,213
<i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i>

1809
02:14:43,382 --> 02:14:47,251
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

1810
02:14:50,923 --> 02:14:52,481
What?

1811
02:14:56,095 --> 02:14:57,586
What?

1812
02:14:59,899 --> 02:15:02,198
<i>- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

1813
02:15:02,368 --> 02:15:06,328
<i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

1814
02:15:06,506 --> 02:15:07,837
<i>- You seen anything?
- Frank.</i>

1815
02:15:08,007 --> 02:15:11,603
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

1816
02:15:11,778 --> 02:15:16,340
<i>- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.</i>

1817
02:15:16,516 --> 02:15:19,452
Hey, I can explain that!

1818
02:15:24,625 --> 02:15:26,649
Costello recorded everything.

1819
02:15:26,827 --> 02:15:31,389
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1820
02:15:31,564 --> 02:15:33,055
His lawyer came to me.

1821
02:15:33,233 --> 02:15:34,996
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1822
02:15:35,167 --> 02:15:37,158
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

1823
02:15:37,837 --> 02:15:41,034
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1824
02:15:41,541 --> 02:15:44,135
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1825
02:15:44,311 --> 02:15:46,337
...you two-faced faggot.

1826
02:15:46,645 --> 02:15:50,479
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1827
02:15:50,650 --> 02:15:52,585
You keep your cell on.

1828
02:16:04,698 --> 02:16:06,462
Open the door.

1829
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:14,463
Open... Didn't we already talk about this?

1830
02:16:15,643 --> 02:16:17,804
This is my job.

1831
02:16:43,069 --> 02:16:45,060
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1832
02:16:45,238 --> 02:16:46,763
Put the fucking gun down!

1833
02:16:46,941 --> 02:16:50,172
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1834
02:16:50,343 --> 02:16:51,902
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1835
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:54,104
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1836
02:16:54,281 --> 02:16:57,877
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1837
02:16:58,051 --> 02:17:01,021
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1838
02:17:01,188 --> 02:17:04,680
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1839
02:17:04,860 --> 02:17:06,851
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1840
02:17:07,029 --> 02:17:08,894
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1841
02:17:09,063 --> 02:17:11,462
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1842
02:17:11,632 --> 02:17:14,466
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1843
02:17:14,636 --> 02:17:16,536
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1844
02:17:16,704 --> 02:17:19,969
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1845
02:17:20,141 --> 02:17:23,270
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1846
02:17:23,444 --> 02:17:26,106
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1847
02:17:26,281 --> 02:17:28,748
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1848
02:17:28,916 --> 02:17:31,612
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1849
02:17:31,787 --> 02:17:36,246
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1850
02:17:36,424 --> 02:17:39,189
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1851
02:17:41,930 --> 02:17:44,159
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1852
02:17:44,333 --> 02:17:46,028
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1853
02:17:46,468 --> 02:17:48,368
Get up.

1854
02:17:49,538 --> 02:17:52,564
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1855
02:17:52,742 --> 02:17:55,266
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1856
02:17:55,443 --> 02:17:58,810
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1857
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:01,950
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1858
02:18:02,117 --> 02:18:04,244
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1859
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:06,649
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1860
02:18:06,822 --> 02:18:10,519
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1861
02:18:10,691 --> 02:18:15,355
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1862
02:18:17,765 --> 02:18:19,700
Maybe you do.

1863
02:18:19,869 --> 02:18:21,995
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1864
02:18:22,170 --> 02:18:25,138
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1865
02:18:25,307 --> 02:18:28,275
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1866
02:18:28,443 --> 02:18:30,537
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1867
02:18:30,712 --> 02:18:32,907
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1868
02:18:36,218 --> 02:18:38,049
You know who I am.

1869
02:19:03,179 --> 02:19:05,043
Shut up.

1870
02:19:06,082 --> 02:19:09,108
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1871
02:19:09,284 --> 02:19:10,478
...you fucking cocksucker.

1872
02:19:10,653 --> 02:19:13,177
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1873
02:19:24,334 --> 02:19:26,631
Just fucking kill me.

1874
02:19:28,237 --> 02:19:30,398
Just fucking kill me.

1875
02:19:32,675 --> 02:19:34,735
I am killing you.

1876
02:20:10,948 --> 02:20:13,677
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1877
02:20:13,916 --> 02:20:16,215
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1878
02:20:16,386 --> 02:20:18,081
It's you and me now, you understand?

1879
02:20:18,254 --> 02:20:21,121
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1880
02:20:34,737 --> 02:20:36,329
Give me that.

1881
02:20:51,755 --> 02:20:55,122
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

1882
02:21:03,334 --> 02:21:05,529
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

1883
02:21:05,701 --> 02:21:10,229
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

1884
02:21:10,407 --> 02:21:12,568
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

1885
02:21:12,744 --> 02:21:15,177
<i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i>

1886
02:21:15,345 --> 02:21:17,540
<i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

1887
02:21:17,715 --> 02:21:20,878
...and discovered that they had expired.

1888
02:21:24,055 --> 02:21:26,318
I just wanna go on record.

1889
02:21:27,058 --> 02:21:31,016
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1890
02:21:42,005 --> 02:21:44,337
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1891
02:21:44,510 --> 02:21:47,411
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1892
02:21:47,578 --> 02:21:50,377
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1893
02:21:50,548 --> 02:21:52,879
May his soul and the souls...

1894
02:21:53,050 --> 02:21:57,886
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1895
02:21:58,056 --> 02:21:59,647
Amen.

1896
02:22:29,086 --> 02:22:31,316
Detail. Half left. Face.

1897
02:22:32,691 --> 02:22:34,682
Prepare to fire.

1898
02:22:34,926 --> 02:22:36,554
Fire.

1899
02:22:36,728 --> 02:22:39,219
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1900
02:22:40,131 --> 02:22:43,157
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:22:43,602 --> 02:22:46,900
Detail. Half right. Face.

1902
02:23:00,319 --> 02:23:02,685
I'll catch up with you guys.

1903
02:23:09,961 --> 02:23:11,792
What about the baby?

1904
02:23:29,514 --> 02:23:31,141
Hi, pup.

1905
02:24:02,682 --> 02:24:04,308
Okay.
