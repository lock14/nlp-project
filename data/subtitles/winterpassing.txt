00:44:51,468 --> 00:44:53,835
He writes literary nightmares

Pulling out Uzis at People's Park<i>!

506
00:44:56,012 --> 00:44:59,787
<i>She wrote about upper-middle-class</i>
<i>American executive types...

508

her fair share of literary nightmares<i>!

509
00:45:05,676 --> 00:45:10,051
<i>I actually think she wrote pseudo-literary</i>
<i>love stories disguised as social satire.

510
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:14,051
Well, obviously you would know
better than I do<i>!

517
00:45:29,484 --> 00:45:31,939
<i>And it's funny.

518
00:45:32,044 --> 00:45:34,891
As a teacher, he was always preaching
compositional velocity<i>!!!

519
00:45:34,988 --> 00:45:39,047
And boring your fingers into the keyboard
as though fiction is some kind of sport<i>!

520
00:45:39,149 --> 00:45:42,629
<i>And now,</i>
<i>getting a paragraph out ofhim...

521
00:45:42,732 --> 00:45:46,955
is like pulling a piano out of a pond<i>!

522
00:45:52,845 --> 00:45:54,950
Would he ever show you his stuff?

523
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,670
I've had to buy every book he's written<i>!

524
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,387

Won't do much for your self-esteem<i>!

528
00:46:08,717 --> 00:46:10,855

- <i>Nothing.

530

542
00:47:27,756 --> 00:47:30,985
So you've never actually met him?

543
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:33,539
- I'm basically just a fan<i>!</i>
- Excuse me, Reese!

544

- Mr<i>!</i> Holden has- has recently expired<i>!

549
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,489
- <i>Expired?</i>
- That's right- expired<i>!

550
00:47:56,589 --> 00:48:00,964
- He died?
- He's officially concluded
all of his earthly business<i>!

551
00:48:01,068 --> 00:48:03,435
And he's no longer around
to talk about it<i>!!!

552
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:06,848
So please remove yourself from the premises
or I'll be forced to seize your person<i>!

553
00:48:06,956 --> 00:48:09,607
- <i>Is that understood?</i>
- Totally understood<i>!

554

<i>Could you please stop</i>
