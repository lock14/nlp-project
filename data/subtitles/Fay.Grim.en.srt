2
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:09,900
Fay?

3
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:13,904
Are you okay?

4
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:16,911
I'm afraid.

5
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,143
Why? Has something happened?

6
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,646
I'm afraid for my son.

7
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,622
He's 14.

8
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,864
Boys have been known to survive that, Fay.

9
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,893
I'm afraid he'll grow up to be...

10
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,372
...well... like his father.

11
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,410
I know... I know what you're thinking.
Forgive the man...

12
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,644
...nobody's perfect.

13
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,874
But I go forgive him.

14
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,147
I always did.

15
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,883
That's my problem.

16
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,624
I mean, like, who was Henry anyway?

17
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,358
We lived together for 7 years.

18
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,662
Had a child. Shared a home.

19
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,393
And I don't even know where he came from.

20
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,859
You must miss him very much, I think.

21
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,270
Excuse me.

22
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,270
Hi, it's Fay.

23
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,265
Fay.

24
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,634
Thank you for coming.

25
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,835
This is the end of the line for you, Mister.

26
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,779
- But, Mom...
- Sit up straight.

27
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,873
Let's step inside.

28
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,185
Ned brought this pornographic
device to school today...

29
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,382
...and was caught showing it off
to the other children.

30
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,519
- What is it?
- See for yourself.

31
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,893
- Mom, you got to turn it on.
- Where?

32
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,891
It has a crank thing on the side.

33
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,901
Wow...

34
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,139
That's cool, huh?

35
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,033
Where did you get this?

36
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,309
It came in the mail.

37
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,543
- Whose mail?
- Our mail.

38
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,912
- Since when do you open the mail?
- It was addressed to me.

39
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,046
Well, then who sent it to you?

40
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,381
I don't know.
There was no return address or letter or anything.

41
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:39,854
It's an orgy.

42
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,155
Yeah, I know that, Ned.

43
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,523
Fay, where he got it is not the issue.

44
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:47,256
The point is he can't bring
this sort of thing into the school.

45
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,662
You're grounded like... forever.

46
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,256
- Come on. Let's go.
- Fay.

47
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,923
Can I have a word with you in private?

48
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,904
It's no secret in this school,
or in this town, of course...

49
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,747
That Ned's father was no model citizen.

50
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,743
Tell me about it.
I took back my maiden name.

51
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,252
Yes... your maiden name.

52
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:21,294
But it is also not lost on your neighbors
or Ned's classmate that his uncle...

53
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:28,401
...your brother, is the notorious
and controversial poet, Simon Grim.

54
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,536
Yes. We're very proud of Simon.

55
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,870
Fay, your bother is in a state penitentiary.

56
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,375
So?

57
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,141
Well he's hardly a role model.

58
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,375
Ned can't help who his family is.

59
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:49,887
Fay.

60
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,759
Have you ever thought of moving
to a different town?

61
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,267
Hello.

62
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,416
- Good afternoon, Fay.
- Hi.

63
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,613
Mister James is expecting you.
Can I take these?

64
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:22,890
This way please.

65
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,293
Fay, Hello. I'm Angus.

66
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,528
It's nice to meet you finally after all these years.

67
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,896
You're not going to stop publishing
Simon's poetry are you?

68
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,265
What? No.

69
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,738
His royalty checks are the only thing
we have to live on, we just moved to a new home.

70
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,774
No, no, not at all. Please. Fay, no.

71
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,943
Simon's been a gold mine.
I'd be insane to drop him.

72
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,379
And don't you worry about those royalty checks.

73
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,476
And if I may say so...
I consider Simon my friend.

74
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,153
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

75
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:58,389
Nevertheless,
and you might be surprised to hear this... Fay.

76
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,895
Iconoclastic avant garde... poetry of
the kind your brother has come to personify.

77
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:06,856
This marginal yet vital form
of artistic expression...

78
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,163
...is becoming less and less popular in America.

79
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:16,137
- Oh no, really?
- Yes, but I have an idea.

80
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:22,281
Fay, are you aware that I once read
your husband's book? His Confessions?

81
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,650
Yes, Simon tried to get you to publish them.

82
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:25,846
That's right, he did.

83
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,013
And I decided against it...

84
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:32,191
...even though Simon threatened to renege
on our deal to publish his own poetry.

85
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,160
I remember.

86
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,123
It was a trying time.

87
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,533
To be perfectly frank, Fay...

88
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,732
...I must tell youl thought
Henry's book was quite bad.

89
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,265
- Simon thought so too.
- Yes, he did.

90
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,500
Nevertheless...

91
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,847
Since your brother's trial five years ago,
things have changed.

92
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:58,551
Simon, you're being charged with the
willful obstruction of justice...

93
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,921
...aiding and abetting a known criminal...
...of falsifying official documents.

94
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:06,792
Why would a world... famous poet,
a literary celebrity,

95
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,895
stoop to help a man of such
negligible redeeming value

96
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,491
at such cost to his
own reputation and livelihood?

97
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,267
He was my friend.

98
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:22,268
Or was it what he was carrying was more
valuable in your eyes than the pursuit of justice!

99
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,378
What was he carrying, Simon?

100
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,283
What did Henry Fool have with him...

101
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,618
...as he boarded that flight
to Sweden pretending to be you.

102
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:38,620
His book. His Confessions.
Eight or so notebooks.

103
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,865
And some extra shirts.

104
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,668
As a result of all this,
Simon Grim fans the world over...

105
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,671
...as well as his most fierce
and dedicated detractors...

106
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:58,177
...have seized upon this mysterious friend,
Henry Fool, and his fabled Confessions...

107
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,411
...as an essential key

108
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:04,049
to the deeper understanding of the incarcerated
garbage man poet of Woodside, Queens.

109
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,746
It's been great for business.

110
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,720
But, you see, it won't last forever.

111
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,292
Henry is larger than life now.

112
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,529
And his Confessions a desperately sought
after commodity now.

113
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,492
The time to strike is now. We've got to get
our hands on those books and publish them.

114
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,502
But they're bad, right?

115
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,541
Not worth publishing.
You said so yourself.

116
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,034
Well, we can't be too hard-line
about these things, Fay.

117
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:35,243
Anything capable of being sold...
...can be worth publishing.

118
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,016
You haven't...

119
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,618
I mean... Henry hasn't...

120
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,385
you know... Been in contact with you.
Has he?

121
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:49,893
No.

122
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,358
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,525
It's okay.

124
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:58,161
I realize you must... well, miss the man.

125
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,744
I hope I never see him again.

126
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,513
Really...

127
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:07,915
I mean it.

128
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,378
I'm single.

129
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:13,617
Sort of.

130
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,617
I was wondering...

131
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,919
Yeah?

132
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,763
Well, I was wondering if, perhaps,..

133
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,163
I was wondering if you'd care to have dinner
with me some night this week?

134
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,145
You mean, like, you know... a date?

135
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:47,786
I'm afraid so.

136
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,788
Agent Fulbright, CIA.

137
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,524
This is Agent Fogg,
but you can call him Carl.

138
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,426
Hi.

139
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,394
How did you get in here?

140
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,430
We're professionals, Fay.
They teach us stuff like that, at the Academy.

141
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,401
Fay, we'd like to ask you some questions
about your husband.

142
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,801
When will this end?

143
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,536
How long are you going to harass me!

144
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,506
I have no idea where my husband is!

145
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,509
I'm single. Sort of.

146
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:49,505
Yeah, we know. But the case
is still open and new evidence has arisen.

147
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,744
Evidence of what?

148
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,789
Fay, where were you...
...when Henry boarded that plane for Sweden?

149
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,192
At home, I didn't go to the airport.
Only my brother Simon was with him.

150
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,889
We went over all this during the trial.

151
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,830
But Simon didn't actually see him board
the plane. Did he?

152
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,933
Your brother last saw Henry at the departure
gate, having by already then...

153
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:12,671
...successfully forged documents permitting him
to leave the country under a false identity.

154
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,504
Well, yeah. But so what?

155
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,910
Well so, maybe he never got on the plane.

156
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,645
Why wouldn't he have gotten on the plane?

157
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,181
He was in trouble. He was running away.
That was the whole point.

158
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,882
Last minute pangs of conscience?

159
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,884
Conscience? Henry? Please.

160
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,521
He may have suddenly felt full force
the love that he had for you, his son...

161
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,823
...his friends, the community.

162
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:31,848
Easy, Carl.

163
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,019
Henry would have gotten on that plane.

164
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,926
And, anyway, if you ask me,
its what he should have done.

165
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,133
Fay, he killed a man.

166
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,304
It was an accident.

167
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,899
He was defending himself.
The man he killed was gross.

168
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,775
Do you really have so little faith in society?

169
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,811
I mean... why are you so certain
Henry wouldn't have been exonerated?

170
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,906
Carl, that's enough. Fay, look.

171
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,053
It appears that Henry boarded
the plane posing as your brother Simon.

172
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,614
But he didn't get off the plane in Stockholm.

173
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,622
Which makes us think that
he had an accomplice at the airport.

174
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,062
You mean, besides Simon?

175
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,765
Does the name Konchalovsky
mean anything to you?

176
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,257
- No.
- Bebe.

177
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,860
Bebe Konchalovsky.

178
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:24,410
We understand that Henry kept a diary,
some kind of a journal, many volumes.

179
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,412
What he referred to as his Confessions.

180
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,506
Yeah so?

181
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,373
Did you ever read this book?
These Confessions?

182
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,185
A little. Once. By accident.

183
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,916
Could you tell us about what you've read?

184
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:36,655
I'd rather not.

185
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,251
Was it treasonous?

186
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:46,898
Did it seem to discuss subjects potentially dangerous
to the security of the United States of America?

187
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,360
I just read the dirty parts.

188
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,938
The dirty parts?

189
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,032
You get that, Carl?

190
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:55,642
Got it.

191
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:58,009
What are you saying,
that Henry was some sort of a spy?

192
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,143
Or worse...

193
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,023
Look, Fay...

194
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,023
What?

195
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,125
Fay, Henry's dead.

196
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,144
Ma, you okay?

197
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,387
Yeah.

198
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,617
Did you eat?

199
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,426
I'll make something.

200
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,862
What time is it? Where have you been?

201
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,390
It's 7:30.

202
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,730
I was at the library. Didn't they call you?

203
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,636
Who?

204
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,502
The school.

205
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,637
I had my cell phone turned off.
Why? What happened now?

206
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,891
I've been expelled.

207
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,136
Ma?

208
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:31,872
Ma? You okay?

209
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,008
Go eat.

210
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,818
Don't do anything... drastic.

211
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:50,189
Like what... drown myself because
you've been expelled from school?

212
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,823
Go away and leave me alone!

213
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,622
Conceited little monster.

214
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:20,052
Then after all that the school calls
and tells me Ned's been caught getting a blow job

215
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,655
from these two 16 year old girls right down
the hall from the Principal's office.

216
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,022
Now he's expelled.

217
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,855
Wait a minute. Back up.

218
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,628
They actually said Henry's dead?

219
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,401
When? Where?

220
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:38,763
Berlin, Germany. Two days after he ran away.

221
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,041
And you believe them?

222
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,808
They're the CIA, Simon.

223
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,776
The Government of
the United States Of America.

224
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,645
God! Get with it.

225
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,137
Do you have the package from Angus?

226
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,729
They think there was an accomplice
at the airport.

227
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,863
- You mean, besides me?
- Yes.

228
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,400
There was no accomplice at the airport.

229
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,597
But you didn't actually see him
get on the plane, did you?

230
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,163
Well, no, not exactly. But...

231
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,042
What wouldn't he have gotten on the plane?

232
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,842
He was running away.
That was the whole point.

233
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,281
Maybe he had, you know, second thoughts.

234
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:25,616
Maybe he felt all at once the... the ahh...

235
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,252
What?

236
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,059
Forget it Simon,
you've got to get out of jail.

237
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,927
I can't handle all this on my own.

238
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,897
Ned needs a father figure or something.

239
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,732
What do you want me to do, escape?

240
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,536
You might be eligible for early parole
on account of your good behavior.

241
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,405
Ask.

242
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:47,306
I won't be eligible for another couple of years.

243
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,807
We can't wait that long!

244
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,909
They'll send Ned to reform school.

245
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,402
He'll be in prison before he's...
...old enough to get a driver's license.

246
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,044
Look, if you need anything at all,
just ask Angus.

247
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:01,914
She's got a date with him.

248
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:03,790
What?

249
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,058
He's taking her to the theater...
...and supper and stuff.

250
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,152
Calls her all the time.

251
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,495
Evaporate.

252
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:11,865
See you later.

253
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,735
You're dating my publisher?

254
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,899
You got a problem with that?

255
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,885
Simon.

256
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,118
I spent a lot of time
and money tracking this book down.

257
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,522
I'm fairly certain it is book
six of Henry Fool's Confession.

258
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,830
If it's for real, keep it with you.

259
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,026
It's safer there.

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,368
I'm beginning to think
your suspicions are correct.

261
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,138
I chose not to tell Fay everything.

262
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,500
Perhaps the less she knows the safer she'll be.

263
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,370
We'll talk soon.

264
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,010
Yours, etc. Angus.

265
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,017
I want Simon released from prison.

266
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,052
That's not as easy as it sounds, Fay.

267
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:10,188
The Governor's gonna kick and scream...
...if the feds try to negotiate his release!

268
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,890
You understand, don't you, Carl?

269
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,792
I mean, he is up for parole soon.

270
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,660
Years from now. Forget it.

271
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,027
Carl, go take a walk in the rain.

272
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,069
Bye Carl.

273
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,163
Leave him alone.

274
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:26,898
He likes me.

275
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,869
That's his problem.

276
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,510
I won't cooperate unless Simon
is released from prison.

277
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,919
Ok. We'll see what we can do about your brother.
But I'm not promising anything.

278
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,479
Now, will you do it or not?

279
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,857
What do you want me to do, exactly?

280
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,724
I mean, what's this all about?

281
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,531
That's not how it works, Fay.

282
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,299
We tell you just enough
for you to complete your mission.

283
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,536
Then, if all goes well and
we decide to move on, we tell you more.

284
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,404
It's called plausible denyabilty, Mom.

285
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,906
Why isn't this kid at school?

286
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:03,308
- Ned, go upstairs.
- I'm hungry.

287
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,508
Here. Go buy yourself a pizza, scram.

288
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:25,023
French Secret Service have
two books of Henry's Confession.

289
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,766
Really? Where'd they get them?

290
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,901
They were found in the possession
of a notorious drug smuggler

291
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,030
who swears he got them
from Bebe Konchalovsky.

292
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,172
And who is that?

293
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,173
Nobody knows for sure.

294
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:35,942
A terrorist.

295
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:38,741
Wanted by the Russians,
the Israelis, the French, and us.

296
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,745
What would terrorists want
with Henry's notebooks?

297
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,847
What would anybody want
from Henry's notebooks?

298
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,721
Got me.

299
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,063
The books contain information the French
can use to blackmail the United States.

300
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:58,895
With what?

301
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,028
Who cares with what. Besides, it's classified.

302
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,903
Fulbright... Henry was a garbage man.

303
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,905
Yeah, for five years here in Woodside Queens,
he was a garbage man.

304
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,311
And?

305
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:15,406
So, what the hell was
he doing in Afghanistan in 1989, for instance?

306
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,620
- What?
- We have evidence Fay. Witnesses.

307
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,191
Luckily we got some bad dope
on the French at the moment

308
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,286
which might urge them to back off
if we get compromised.

309
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,597
Really? What do you need me for?

310
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,897
The French are in a tight spot.

311
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,905
The German's, the Belgians,
the Israelis, China...

312
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,773
...nobody wants the French to hand
over those books to the U.S.

313
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,309
However, there's a treaty, an old one,
and a loophole in that treaty...

314
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,312
...which prevents the French government
from impounding an American citizen's property...

315
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,048
...under certain narrowly defined conditions
which we have recently had broadened...

316
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,817
...due to the current unstable international
terrorist situation, etc.

317
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,185
So, the books written by Henry...

318
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,922
...and you are Henry's widow,
the books obviously belong to you.

319
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,823
The French will take a lot of crap
from the European Union...

320
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,058
...for a week or two, but then so what.

321
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,826
Believe me, Fay, this is critical.

322
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,921
And you're the only one
who can do what needs to be done.

323
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:09,363
I want Simon released from prison.

324
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,376
I think it's real.

325
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,809
Are you sure?

326
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,544
Angus, has it ever occurred to you...

327
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:25,507
...that, perhaps, Henry's Confessions were
simply too completely awful to be true?

328
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,052
You mean as in bad?

329
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:28,653
- Inept.
- Idiotic?

330
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,056
- Right.
- Oh yes, that was my first impression, certainly.

331
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,753
Try to remember what you read.

332
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:36,157
Try to peel away the layers of
masturbatory self indulgence.

333
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:41,666
The ego-maniacal rant, the paranoid obsessions,
the sexual preoccupation.

334
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,033
Would there be anything left?

335
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,403
Look over my left shoulder.

336
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,167
There's a prisoner down the row reading a book.

337
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,047
Yeah, I see him.

338
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,481
His name is Herzog.

339
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,720
He once worked for the CIA.

340
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,014
He was what they called...

341
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,884
...an encryption specialist.

342
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,853
He invented codes.

343
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,025
Go talk to him.

344
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:16,861
Ask him about operation Inferno.

345
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,163
He's expecting you.

346
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,273
I was the chief attache to the US operative in...

347
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,749
Bitch!

348
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:39,882
...in a certain South American...
country during it's first free and open elections.

349
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,161
Put that thing down.

350
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,899
Ned look, if I do this thing for them in Paris,
they're gonna get uncle Simon out of jail.

351
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,137
- No way!
- Yes way.

352
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,311
And besides it will give me
an opportunity to wear this nice coat...

353
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,280
...that Angus has got me.

354
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,357
Did your father ever tell you...

355
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,431
Unusual bedtime stories when I wasn't around.

356
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,162
Sure. All the time.

357
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,363
What were they about?

358
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,403
About the places he'd been to.

359
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,498
Things he got away with.

360
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,901
Those were the best ones.

361
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,503
Like what things?

362
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,184
He told me not to tell you.

363
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,744
Come on Ned, I mean it.

364
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,390
I promised.

365
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,890
You were 5 years old.

366
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,985
He had no right to make you promise anything.

367
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,359
But I did.

368
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,272
Do we have like a map of
the world or something?

369
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,880
Where's Afghanistan?

370
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,615
There.

371
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,883
- Did your father ever tell you about Afghanistan?
- Yeah.

372
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:19,488
Really?

373
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,193
Sure.

374
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:23,895
See, the mountains, here,
leading up to the Hindu Kush,

375
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,627
across the Himalayas, then on to Tibet.

376
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,267
He said he'd been there too?

377
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:30,892
He'd been everywhere.

378
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,804
See Jerusalem here.

379
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,640
Mecca. Iraq.

380
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,941
Rome. The Vatican-city.

381
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,638
The Pope threw a chair at him once.

382
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,504
Okay. Stop. That's enough.

383
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,274
Do you believe them?

384
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:44,614
Who?

385
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,852
Fulbright. You believe Dad's dead?

386
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,127
Hello?

387
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,666
He was shot in the street, returning to the office.

388
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,535
He'll be ok, they think.

389
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,670
He was very lucky. But he's raving.

390
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,162
They're getting ready to operate now.

391
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:13,545
- Angus!
- Fay, thank God!

392
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,276
Milla, get my trousers! Let's get out of here!

393
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,650
Angus, cool it! You've been shot. Calm down.

394
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,785
Listen, Fay, think!

395
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:24,289
You, Simon, and myself... are the only people
who ever read the Confessions.

396
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,124
You think you've been shot
because you've read Henry's notebooks?

397
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:29,386
Yes. Isn't it obvious?

398
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,259
No, it isn't.

399
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:36,599
Look, Fay...

400
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,672
I found one of Henry's books
and I had you smuggle it into Simon.

401
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:43,808
He's right, Henry was in South America.
In the 70's.

402
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,176
That's impossible.

403
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,779
He was an eye witness to
the overthrow of Governments there.

404
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,180
He mentions Fulbright by name.

405
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:50,882
Twice. And there's more...

406
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,051
Sorry, miss,
we've got to get him into surgery right away.

407
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,285
Fay, I'm sorry.

408
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,881
Someone knows we have that book
and they will kill to get it.

409
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,294
When you disembark at Paris
you go directly to the ladies room.

410
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,896
Before you clear customs.

411
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,664
It'll be on your left as you enter the terminal.

412
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,258
The operative will establish contact.

413
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,767
How?

414
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:10,895
Impossible to say.

415
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,305
Check the time before you enter the ladies room.
Wait only 5 minutes.

416
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,866
If contact isn't established in 5 minutes, abort.

417
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,883
If these guys don't get Uncle Simon out
of jail by six o'clock this evening...

418
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:26,417
...call me right away at the hotel
and leave a message.

419
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,249
Okay.

420
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,423
- You've got the number, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

421
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,016
Okay.

422
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:44,898
You don't fly much do you?

423
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,003
I do, often.

424
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,276
It will be over in no time.

425
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,242
My name is Andre.

426
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,139
- Fay.
- Enchanted.

427
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:17,536
What's this?

428
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:20,267
Angus bought Mom a new couch.
Come on, Check out my new computer.

429
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,546
Simon, what are you doing out of jail?

430
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,415
What are you doing out of the hospital?

431
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,950
I'm a sitting duck in the hospital, Simon.

432
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,952
Someone's trying to kill me, haven't you heard?

433
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:35,820
You'd be safer in jail too.

434
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,754
Where's Fay?

435
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,491
She cut a deal with the Feds.

436
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,496
She's on her way to Paris
to retrieve two of Henry's books

437
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,764
How could you let her do that!

438
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,299
I didn't know until an hour ago.

439
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,767
She negotiated for my release.

440
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,863
Here, take a look at this. It came in the mail.

441
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:01,377
Wow.

442
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,377
- It's an orgy.
- It sure is.

443
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,403
You see, it was not so bad after all.

444
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,737
Thanks so much. I really enjoyed myself.

445
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,633
I am in Paris for the week.

446
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,374
- Perhaps I can see you again?
- Sure. Okay.

447
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,819
- Welcome home Simon.
- Thank you Father.

448
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,921
Sorry to get you out of bed so early.

449
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,015
We need your help.

450
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,487
You have to look into it and turn the crank.

451
00:28:58,771 --> 00:28:59,864
Sorry Father.

452
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,807
We need to know about the writing on the wall...

453
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:05,910
...behind the three people, you know, on the...

454
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,745
Yes, on the wall behind
the two girls with the goat.

455
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,715
We thought it might be Latin.

456
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:57,922
Old. Ancient.

457
00:29:58,931 --> 00:29:59,899
Hebrew maybe.

458
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,898
Semitic, certainly.

459
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,737
No, Slovak.

460
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,138
I can't tell really
with all the foreground debauchery.

461
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:09,807
Why is this important?

462
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,242
We think Henry might have sent it.

463
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,136
They told Fay he was dead.

464
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:14,912
And offered no proof.

465
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:18,549
Just hear-say. A rumor off the Internet.

466
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,951
Why would they deceive her?

467
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:24,188
Because the only way they can get those books
away from the French is if Fay is a widow.

468
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,423
The French?

469
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,191
What the French got to do with it?

470
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,760
And which books?
Simon, what's going on?

471
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,297
We think Fay's been roped in to some
kind of international espionage, Father.

472
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,631
By whom? And why?

473
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:41,637
I was mistaken about Henry's book
when I read it seven years ago.

474
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,474
It was not what I thought it was.

475
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,739
Keep this phone with you.

476
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:51,309
Clear customs, retrieve your luggage...

477
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,777
...and meet Monsieur Picard

478
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:57,011
and his people from the Ministry Of Security
just outside the baggage claim.

479
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,043
I will be in touch.

480
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:02,618
Father...

481
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,856
Look, father, this is book six.

482
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:09,060
Simon's fellow inmate, Herzog,
claims that in 1973...

483
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:12,897
Henrry was taught a basic but now
outdated CIA encrypting method...

484
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,766
...by one of his associates probably
this guy Fulbright.

485
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,401
You mean, its code.

486
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:22,907
Sort of, an old fashioned technique
of composing sentences...

487
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:27,278
...in some sort of consistent but
obscure relationship to a pre-existing text.

488
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:31,649
Whereas in the original text,
what's called the concordance...

489
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,419
...there is a noun,
in the new communique there is a verb.

490
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,380
Likewise, the placement of adverbs
and adjectives are reversed.

491
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,118
The result is usually gibberish

492
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:44,161
Well, you've both read it.

493
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,530
Is that how you describe Henry's Confession?

494
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,300
No. Illogical. Pedantic.

495
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,669
Contradictory. But not gibberish.

496
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:56,307
Using this method, only a certain type of
idiot savant would be capable of constructing...

497
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,042
...an intelligible alternate meaning,

498
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:00,376
however crazy, for the length of,
say, a sentence or two.

499
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,282
Henry wrote eight volumes.

500
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:07,514
How do we begin?

501
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,146
We'll need this to start.

502
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,856
Milton's Paradise Lost.

503
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,257
I believe it's the concordance.

504
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,005
Hello?

505
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:32,043
Listen carefully.

506
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:35,546
At the Ministry Of Security...
...the French will give you two books.

507
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:38,549
In one of those books, on the 17th page...

508
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,551
...two paragraphs from the bottom,

509
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:43,750
there will be a paragraph written
in blue ink rather than black.

510
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,857
The third sentence of this paragraph
will be in quotations.

511
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,256
Do you understand me?

512
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:53,157
Repeat it for me.

513
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:59,303
Page 17, second paragraph from the bottom
in blue ink, third sentence in quotations.

514
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:00,538
Good.

515
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,908
Afterwards, as you leave,
you will see a woman on the staircase.

516
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,644
She will drop her pen and
lean down to pick it up.

517
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:09,780
If either one of the notebooks have
a paragraph written in blue ink...

518
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,651
...on the 17th page
with the third sentence in quotations...

519
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:16,622
...hold the package containing them
in your left hand.

520
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,252
Otherwise, hold them in your right.

521
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,021
Do you understand?

522
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:25,488
- Yes.
- Good.

523
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:28,897
And then what?

524
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:33,630
Keep this phone with you,
turn off the ringer and put it on vibrate.

525
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,873
Place the books in the hotel safe.
Your work will be done.

526
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,271
What do you got Ned?

527
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,415
I've created a program,
where we type in the confession...

528
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,147
...the computer translates all the nouns
and the verbs and everything.

529
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,883
As long as it can recognize the concordance.

530
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,424
That means we'll have to type
in all of Paradise Lost too, won't we?

531
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,525
This could take days.

532
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,926
I found it online, Angus.

533
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,663
Now we just have to see if we can download
and import it into Ned's program.

534
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,155
Oh that's easy. Let me see.

535
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,903
My apologies. But it's crucial I think.

536
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:06,772
I bet.

537
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,138
What is it Rabbi, can you read it?

538
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:11,871
The dame with the big caboose
is always in the way.

539
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,375
Hold it!

540
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,240
There it is.

541
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,742
I see it. But I can't read it.

542
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,150
It's not Hebrew.

543
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,254
- Maybe it's Chinese.
- That's a Roman alphabet, Rabbi.

544
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,253
I'm not so sure.

545
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:35,026
Father, you know
I think this might be Arabic.

546
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,414
I am happy to say
they are not the words of the prophet.

547
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:24,548
But you can read it, right?

548
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,051
Yes I can.
But not because it's Arabic. It's Turkish.

549
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,285
- No!
- Oh yes.

550
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,015
Let me see that.

551
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,121
Am I wrong?

552
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,886
Well... No.

553
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:37,863
Maybe.

554
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,765
It says... how to translate?

555
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,597
It's a complaint.

556
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,803
The truth teller...

557
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,404
it's much more than that...

558
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,136
the one who says what is...

559
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:55,139
...will always be... what?

560
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,613
Odds with the world... against the grain.

561
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,146
An honest man is always in trouble.

562
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:08,285
Yes. In fact, yes, that is a rough,
but accurate translation.

563
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:13,495
Simon!

564
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:17,897
What is it?

565
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,364
An honest man is always in trouble.

566
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:25,140
That's the first line of Henry's Confession.

567
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,617
This is not just an orgy, Simon.

568
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,520
It's a harem.

569
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,148
Don't worry. It's just a precaution.

570
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:58,896
Having just narrowly escaped...

571
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,899
...death by torture in Chile during
the overthrow of the government there...

572
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,669
Henry surfaces in Nicaragua amazingly
and accidentally...

573
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,038
...as a double-agent for the Sandinistas
and the US backed Contras.

574
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,943
Soon enough, he's wanted dead
or alive by both sides.

575
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:19,183
Pursued by as he says the infernal "F" whom
I think we can take to mean Agent Fulbright.

576
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:23,787
He crosses Honduras, enters Belize,
and at the last possible minute...

577
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:27,658
...is given safe passage to Cuba by
some Hungarian Communists who later claim...

578
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,295
...that Henry sold them information about
the Iran Contra guns for hostages scandal.

579
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:34,832
Which later, here, in part 7, Henry denies,
claiming he knew nothing about it...

580
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:38,068
...and that the Hungarians were only
interested in his radical re-interpretation...

581
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:42,406
of Blake's Marriage Of Heaven And Hell
and, it seems certain of his chemistry experiments.

582
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,174
For which reason,
they promptly fly him to Bucharest.

583
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,309
Thanks, Milla.

584
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,278
Henry was a chemist?

585
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,376
More to the point, Father,
how old a chemist was Henry?

586
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,841
He drank too much and smoked constantly.

587
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,286
He slept little, ate badly, and lived hard.

588
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:01,058
It's difficult to say but Henry could
have been a ravaged man in his early 30's...

589
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,427
...or a well preserved 50 year old.

590
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:05,529
Didn't he have a driver's license, Simon.

591
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,499
- A passport?
- Not that I know of.

592
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,902
Hold on... Here it is.
Their marriage certificate.

593
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,070
What's it say?

594
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:15,870
Husband's date of birth, 1591.

595
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,045
A common error.

596
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,648
Surely he mean 1951.

597
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,844
That would make sense, right?

598
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,483
Barely, let me see that.

599
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:51,741
My American friend has a reservation.
Miss Hopper.

600
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,006
Like the painter.

601
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:04,054
Oh yes, Miss Hopper.
We have your luggage already in your room.

602
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,490
May I ask you for your passport?

603
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,153
May she place an item in the hotel safe?

604
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:11,893
Bien Sur.

605
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:15,130
Are you all right?

606
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,867
I'm sorry about this Fay. I really am.

607
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:25,368
So am I like, you know,
a hostage or something?

608
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,181
This is your receipt. Your passport.

609
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,650
This gentleman..will show you to your room.

610
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,483
Have a pleasant stay Miss Hopper.

611
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,387
You are not a hostage.

612
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:42,257
But you would not be safe if anyone
knew you were in Paris with these books.

613
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:49,900
I wish we had met under
different circumstances.

614
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:50,802
Me too...

615
00:42:50,803 --> 00:42:53,601
Vous etes extraordinary.

616
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,140
Thanks.

617
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,763
Madam?

618
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,249
Yes?

619
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,049
Where are you?

620
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,651
I don't know.

621
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:42,883
Another hotel. Some other part of town.

622
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:44,616
Where are the books?

623
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,057
In the Hotel safe.
I have the receipt.

624
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:47,889
What's happening?

625
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:50,060
Don't worry. I'll find you.

626
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,155
Keep the phone on. I can trace it.

627
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,139
- Simon it's me.
- Fay...

628
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:03,505
...you should not have done this.

629
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:07,137
I had to get you out of prison,
Simon and see it worked.

630
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:11,011
Now Ned can get home schooling from a you
and I won't have to send him to reform school.

631
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,842
Listen, Fay,

632
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:19,385
this Agent Fulbright
has not been telling you the truth.

633
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:23,023
I don't care!
I'm just so glad that you're out of prison, Simon!

634
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,923
Fay. Henry's alive.

635
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:33,633
Fay?

636
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:38,606
Simon.

637
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,811
I'm sorry I realize that...

638
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:46,911
I was just getting used to the idea
that he was you know... dead.

639
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:50,821
- He isn't.
- How do you know that?

640
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:52,518
How can any of us know that?

641
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:57,385
This toy, this binocular thing
that came in the mail...

642
00:44:58,663 --> 00:44:59,892
Hold on. There's someone at the door.

643
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,731
- Hello?
- Fay, it's me.

644
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,367
Andre?

645
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,171
Fay, please. We must talk.

646
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,265
Hold on, Simon.

647
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,615
- Simon, I gotta call you back.
- No, Fay wait.

648
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,354
Your contact is an imposter.

649
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,120
Fulbright's been tricked.

650
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,156
You know about Fulbright?

651
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,889
I worked with him in Afghanistan.

652
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:34,831
I was, in fact, a double agent...
...leaking his secrets to the Russians.

653
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:35,925
But he doesn't know that.

654
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,896
So what, you're like a spy or something?

655
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,502
You sound disappointed.

656
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:46,141
I thought you liked me.

657
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:49,377
I do.

658
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:59,890
I do like you.

659
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:01,257
That's why I feel I must warn you.

660
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,153
About what?

661
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:07,531
This woman who contacted you,
her name is Juliet...

662
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:09,626
...she's an agent of the Israeli Secret Service.

663
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,031
And so, is that like a bad thing?

664
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:16,540
Your husband seemed to know a good deal
about global satellite positioning systems.

665
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:17,509
Really?

666
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,035
Does that surprise you?

667
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:23,780
Each of those books you read today,
when placed side by side...

668
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:28,014
...list the exact coordinates of three US
satellites over a 10 month period in 1994.

669
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:31,386
Towards the middle of each,
certain words are written in red ink.

670
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,190
That's right.

671
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:36,893
But she told me to look
for a blue paragraph on page 17...

672
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,296
- With the third sentence in quotations.
- Right.

673
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:42,065
Proof that its the wrong book.
A decoy.

674
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:44,262
And it's not, is it?

675
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:48,031
There was no blue paragraph in either of them.

676
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,906
Now she knows they're real.

677
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:53,810
She will come for them.
You're in great danger

678
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,413
What's the big deal about
these satellite coordinates anyway?

679
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:59,509
They indicate the location of
an Israeli nuclear missile base.

680
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:01,511
And that's what, not allowed?

681
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:03,387
It's a violation of treaty?

682
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,145
- The missiles?
- And the satellites.

683
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,257
Look, I want to give you these.

684
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,522
Books one and two
of your husband's Confession.

685
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,800
The Russian Secret Service extorted them
from the North Koreans.

686
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:19,669
Who were led to believe
they contained instructions for scrambling...

687
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,161
...the radar for American Spy planes.

688
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:27,637
Why are you doing this?

689
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:33,040
Convince your friend Angus James to part
with the volume in his possession...

690
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,618
...book six. We know he has it.

691
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:43,620
You shot Angus.

692
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:46,392
Not myself, personally.

693
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:48,895
I'm sorry.

694
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:51,261
We needed to impress him.

695
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:57,641
Henry was working at a top secret facility
near Bucharest in 1988.

696
00:47:57,642 --> 00:47:58,942
He disappeared driving a truck

697
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,811
carrying two tons of a poison no one else
in the world even knows about yet.

698
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,947
- It's still missing.
- You're lying! I knew the man.

699
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:06,183
I was married to him.
He was never in these places!

700
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:07,951
There was a scandal. I don't know the details.

701
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:10,285
A girl, her mother, the girl's cousin.
Anyway...

702
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:13,847
Think about it.

703
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:16,121
Think about Angus.

704
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:21,626
We need book six.

705
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:51,294
You will go to the concierge and present
your receipt for the item you placed in the safe.

706
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:54,898
Once you have received the item, we will
cross the lobby and enter the service staircase.

707
00:48:54,899 --> 00:48:56,933
I will take the item and descend it
to the parking garage.

708
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,902
You'll continue to your room.

709
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:00,735
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

710
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,866
There is a gun at your son's head
this very moment.

711
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,778
Pull yourself together. Let's do this.

712
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,872
It'll be over in a minute.

713
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:23,927
Mademoiselle?

714
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:25,863
Oh it's nothing. Sorry.

715
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,859
A man was just run over in the street.

716
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,801
I'd like the package I put in the safe please.

717
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,770
Shall I keep these?

718
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:35,603
Yeah sure, whatever. Thanks.

719
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:39,876
Well done.

720
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,276
Au revoir. Now, don't get me wrong.
I like Americans.

721
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:47,908
I'll take the notebooks, please.

722
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:53,914
Drop the gun Amin and hand me the books!

723
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:15,634
Milla, how can this be! I trusted you!

724
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,642
There will be no peace before Israel
is safe within its borders!

725
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,475
All right, come on. Get her out of here.

726
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:28,280
Hello.

727
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,287
Hey Ma! You won't believe
what's just happened!

728
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,723
Carl just arrested Milla.
She was about to blow my brains out!

729
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:35,622
Fay?

730
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:37,490
Fay?

731
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:40,264
Miss Hopper?

732
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,263
Ca va?

733
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,402
It's all right, Miss. We'll take care of her.

734
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:46,936
- Sir.
- Picard?

735
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,072
He's been hit. Looks bad.
He's on the way to the hospital.

736
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:50,640
The Arab kid is wounded
and trapped in the alley.

737
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:51,808
Who gives a damn.
What about Konchalovsky?

738
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:53,777
- We lost her.
- Fuck!

739
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,912
They've apprehended the accomplice back
in New York.

740
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:56,946
Good. Keep me informed.

741
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,783
Fulbright! They were going to kill my son!

742
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:02,754
Fay, trust me,
we never would have let it go that far.

743
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:05,518
What?

744
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:09,384
Look what they did to her face.

745
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,754
- Is it bad?
- It becomes you.

746
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:15,432
Don't you dare flirt with me, Fulbright.

747
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:17,527
What happened in South America?

748
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:21,028
- What?
- And what's it got to do with Henry?

749
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,540
Who have you been talking to?

750
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,737
He mentions you by name. Twice.

751
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:28,737
I thought you hadn't read the Confessions.

752
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,047
Like I said, a little.

753
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:32,649
Once. By accident.

754
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,651
Yeah, I remember. Just the dirty parts.

755
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,484
He mentions you in the dirty parts.

756
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:44,854
Why are you asking this?

757
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,432
Because I want to know what's going on.

758
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:50,667
Oh yeah, since when?

759
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,303
Since you've decided you can use me
and my family as bait...

760
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:55,637
...for capturing some scary chick in high heels.

761
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:06,049
Henry was an operative of the CIA in Chile...

762
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,284
...during a time when it became necessary
for the United States...

763
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,254
- ...to help overthrow the government there.
- Why?

764
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:11,922
Why what?

765
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:13,618
Why'd we have to overthrow the government?

766
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,150
It was inappropriate
to the needs of the American economy.

767
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:21,164
Hey! Don't get all fuckin' sensitive on me...

768
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:25,125
...that coat you're wearing was most likely made
by a bunch of seven year-olds in Kuala Lampur.

769
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,669
- Really?
- Damn straight.

770
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,305
And you don't see the Malaysians going out
and electing communist governments, right?

771
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:30,540
I don't know.

772
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,809
Exactly, you don't know...

773
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,608
Civilization, Fay...

774
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:38,479
Shit happens.

775
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:47,524
Henry had been a janitor
at the University in Santiago...

776
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:49,192
...with his eyes on the chief librarian job.

777
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:51,160
We led him to believe
that we could help him with that.

778
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,663
That is, in exchange for information
he could gather from the school

779
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:55,832
which was crawling for Russian "advisors".

780
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,534
But aren't the Russian's our friends now?

781
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:59,536
Nobody's our friend, Fay. Remember that.

782
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:01,304
Times change. Alliances shift.

783
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:03,039
Something we were proud of a year ago...

784
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,409
all of a sudden becomes something we've got to
apologize for in front of the United fucking Nations.

785
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,903
Anyway, things went wrong.

786
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:13,883
Our contact in the military assassinated
the president's top general...

787
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,952
...and we were forced to back him up
and instigate a civil war.

788
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:17,654
Henry disappeared in all that.

789
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:20,423
It seems he was captured
by the opposition and tortured...

790
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:24,761
...forced to write a confession which reliable
sources indicate ran to something like 136 pages.

791
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:28,893
As far as we know, laying out the details of the
entire US espionage network in South America.

792
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:32,370
They tortured him?

793
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:36,399
Are you listening to me?

794
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,505
He was so afraid of pain.

795
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,509
You mean to tell me he never let
on to you about any of this?

796
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:54,255
Sometime he'd say things, but you know...

797
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:58,061
...Henry said all sorts of stuff.

798
00:54:58,062 --> 00:54:59,758
It was hard to know what to believe.

799
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:01,531
Look Fay.

800
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:03,933
...look, I'm sorry we had to use you
and Ned to draw fire.

801
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:08,030
We've had Milla pegged for months nothing
would've happened to you or your son.

802
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:09,705
What about Angus?

803
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,544
Ok, I admit, that took us by surprise.

804
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:18,815
What we have to do now, though, is figure
out who exactly Konchalovsky's working for?

805
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,910
- The Israelis, apparently
- Impossible.

806
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,886
Whatever, Fulbright. It's your party after all.

807
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:24,718
Okay...

808
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:28,389
Suppose your right. How do you know this?

809
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,519
Andre told me.

810
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,163
Andre who?

811
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,933
You know, Andre from Afghanistan.

812
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:38,732
He sat next to me on the plane.

813
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:43,773
- Why didn't we know about that.
- Sir?

814
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:47,643
Get Washington on the line and tell them Andre
Soltani was in New York yesterday afternoon!

815
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:49,812
- Right.
- Fuck!

816
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,748
- Relax.
- Will you see him again?

817
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:54,913
Maybe.

818
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,924
I under-estimated you.

819
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,621
Imagine that.

820
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:04,895
What else did he tell you?

821
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:06,397
- Andre?
- Yeah.

822
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:09,065
He leaked your secrets to the Russians
back in Afghanistan.

823
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:11,501
Well, I knew that. I was feeding him
bad information anyway. What else?

824
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:12,733
Sir.

825
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:15,938
This just in from Tel Aviv.

826
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:19,042
Milla's a runaway agent of
the Israeli Secret Service.

827
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:23,003
Suspected operative of an ultra right
wing Zionist pressure group out of Brooklyn.

828
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,050
It's all Greek to me, Fulbright.

829
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,144
I'm going home.

830
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,658
Anything on Andre Soltani?

831
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:38,061
He was killed twenty minutes ago,
three blocks from here.

832
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,394
Shot in the stomach and hit by a car

833
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:41,932
When does she fly home?

834
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:42,833
First thing in the morning.

835
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:43,900
- Direct?
- Yes.

836
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,935
Notify the authorities.
Have her detained when she lands in New York.

837
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:47,268
- Suspected murder?
- No.

838
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:50,641
Espionage.

839
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,285
- Are you Bebe Konchalovsky?
- Yes.

840
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:04,654
I am Bebe Konchalovsky.

841
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:06,146
And I am in big trouble.

842
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:09,885
Come on, we got to get out of here.

843
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,136
He ruined me.

844
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,363
- Who did?
- Henry.

845
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:23,865
But I deserved it, I guess.

846
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:29,246
Fay, we are in love with the same man!

847
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,048
I do not love that man. Got it?

848
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:33,483
It was all just a...

849
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,516
Besides he's dead. They said so.

850
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:40,523
They're lying. And you are too.

851
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:42,525
You wouldn't be here
if you thought he was dead.

852
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:44,761
You wouldn't be here
if you didn't love him.

853
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:46,355
He's alive and he needs our help.

854
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,503
He did unspeakable things to me.

855
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:01,901
I'm sure he did.

856
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:03,377
Why?

857
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:07,509
I stole them.

858
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,519
I stole the Confessions.

859
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:22,524
I thought they were the notebooks
of the famous Simon Grim.

860
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:34,811
Sir, you'll have to stow your luggage
in the over head compartments

861
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:36,371
or let me store them in back.

862
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:43,854
What's in them?

863
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:45,890
Books.

864
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,860
That's all he's taking with him to Sweden,
a bunch of books.

865
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:51,862
Asshole.

866
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:54,262
Bebe, he's Simon Grim.

867
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:57,760
You mean the poet?

868
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,030
He's getting the Nobel Prize.

869
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:03,635
I fell in love at once.

870
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:09,905
He told me everything.

871
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,277
How he wanted to be alone.

872
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:14,842
How he was misunderstood.

873
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:20,622
How for him...
fame has become such a terrible burden.

874
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,492
A curse even.

875
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,153
He needed me to help him find some peace.

876
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,870
We drove all night and made it
to Berlin the next day.

877
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,857
I was tired of being a stewardess.

878
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:02,765
I knew some drug dealers in Paris
who would buy the notebooks...

879
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,735
...of the famous Simon Grim.

880
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:22,785
Don't worry about him.

881
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:25,017
He cheated me. He deserves worse.

882
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:02,857
I went to Hamburg and got a regular job.

883
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,503
Oh... the things he did to me.

884
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,476
You can not imagine.

885
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,046
I told him everything.

886
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,242
He forgave me.

887
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:28,513
And by then I loved him impossibly anyway.

888
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,152
Is that crazy?

889
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:36,385
No. Here, have another napoleon.

890
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,027
Thank you. I am so hungry.

891
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,429
And I have a sweet tooth,

892
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,666
which of course you know is not
so good for the figure of a stewardess.

893
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:45,397
And you never heard from him again?

894
01:01:46,303 --> 01:01:49,772
No. And then those drug dealer
friends of mine told...

895
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:52,308
...everyone I am some kind of spy or something!

896
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,776
They think you're a terrorist.

897
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:57,373
Yeah, it's impossible.
I can't go anywhere with my actual hair color.

898
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,481
Is Bebe Konchalovsky your real name?

899
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:05,019
No... My name is Olga.

900
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:08,517
But call me Bebe. It's prettier.

901
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,891
Fay, please don't let
this Juliet woman find me.

902
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:16,165
If she catches me
they'll send me back to Chechnya.

903
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:18,901
She told the government
I am a spy for the rebels there...

904
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,069
...helping with weapons.

905
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,670
But that was only once.

906
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:22,938
I had no idea.

907
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:26,042
I am not a spy. I am a stewardess.

908
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:28,310
Really! Sometimes a topless dancer...

909
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,509
...but really a stewardess. I was trained.

910
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:42,749
Look... take this money...

911
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,485
Go to the airport tonight.

912
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:47,759
Get a room at the hotel there...

913
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:52,258
...and meet me at the information center
tomorrow morning at 7 am. Okay?

914
01:02:58,775 --> 01:02:59,902
I knew you would be good.

915
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,507
I just knew it.

916
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,506
You are my idol.

917
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:21,895
Hello?

918
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,030
Simon, the world is a mess.

919
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:28,505
It's your mother.

920
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:30,906
I just want a normal life, Simon.

921
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,899
A totally normal life.

922
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,145
That's impossible, Fay.

923
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:41,882
I know.

924
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:47,146
Fay, this toy that arrived in the mail.

925
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:50,357
- There's...
- Simon.

926
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,930
We might not be, you know, alone.

927
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,263
If you know what I mean.

928
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:00,893
Carl, she's onto us.

929
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,912
The... party was wild.

930
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:14,010
Our friend was there.

931
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,248
Yeah. When?

932
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:25,723
On Thanksgiving.

933
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:42,645
The new couch arrived.

934
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:44,376
Oh yeah? How's it look?

935
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:48,616
Foreign.

936
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:57,522
Goodnight, Fay.

937
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:10,504
You got to be kidding me!

938
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,510
Fay. Help me. Please.

939
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,818
Well, you see,
that's what you get for being a terrorist.

940
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:24,186
My arm is broken.

941
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:26,884
So's your leg, I think.
How'd you get away from those guys?

942
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:28,924
I have a mission. I must complete it.

943
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,160
Oh shut up, you can't even stand.

944
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,129
It must be set.

945
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:34,865
What?

946
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:36,133
I need your help.

947
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,128
I can walk with a stick.

948
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:40,871
You need help setting your arm, you mean?

949
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,371
Yes. Please.

950
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:43,867
Why should I help you?

951
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:51,838
Okay. Look...

952
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,512
You know how to do this?

953
01:05:55,785 --> 01:06:01,824
You must pull my arm straight, then...
tie it to something so that it is... you know, bent.

954
01:06:01,825 --> 01:06:02,758
Right.

955
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:05,859
At the elbow. I get it.

956
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:07,861
I saw this on TV.

957
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:10,256
You know this is gonna hurt, right.

958
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,768
I am a soldier of God.

959
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:14,670
Well that's a relief.

960
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:15,764
Bite into this.

961
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:17,632
Hold onto something.

962
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:21,873
You are a good woman, Fay.

963
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,280
Thanks.

964
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:28,719
Someday, when this is all over,
and we have destroyed Western civilization...

965
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,890
It's her. Juliet.

966
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:40,929
Fay, my life is worthless.

967
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,490
But don't allow her to have these books
Promise me.

968
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:08,858
Where are you hurt?

969
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:13,853
I was lucky...

970
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:15,359
It was just a flesh wound.

971
01:07:17,067 --> 01:07:18,262
This is pretty bad.

972
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,170
I think we should get you to a hospital.

973
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:22,538
I've had worse.

974
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:23,632
I'll do it myself.

975
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:25,602
Help me to the bathroom.

976
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:45,492
Sorry.

977
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:50,766
Sacrifices need to be made occasionally.

978
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:52,258
Oh yeah? For what?

979
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:54,131
For a better world perhaps.

980
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,739
What kind of better world is made
by shooting a 14 year old boy in the head?

981
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,901
Children are dying all over the world, Fay.

982
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:03,914
Lift your leg.

983
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:11,753
Shit!

984
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,860
Those thing become human, Fay.

985
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,594
Some dirty work needs to be done.

986
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:24,800
Civilization ought to thank those of us
who are willing to do it.

987
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:29,267
Why is it whenever someone starts talking about
civilization I hear the sound of machine guns?

988
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:31,602
You Americans are soft.

989
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:34,511
Still, I appreciate your help.

990
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:38,180
I just don't want you to die in my hotel room.

991
01:08:38,181 --> 01:08:39,740
I've got to sleep in here tonight

992
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:42,875
There. It's done.

993
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:44,484
Get out.

994
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,020
What happened to the porter?

995
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,523
- What?
- The Arab kid.

996
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:53,855
You were the last to see him.

997
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:57,998
He fell off the side of the building.

998
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:09,379
Here. I want you to have these.

999
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:11,740
Are they real?

1000
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,015
Perhaps. Who knows?

1001
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:16,275
The Arab kid has what I need.

1002
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,518
I seem to have bled on your couch.

1003
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,725
Actually, that's an ottoman.

1004
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:26,528
You Americans,
you know all about home furnishings...

1005
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:29,021
...but have no clue what's happening
in the world around you.

1006
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,260
I know I don't want the killing to continue.

1007
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:35,404
And you think that's generosity of spirit,
don't you?

1008
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:37,135
I thought you liked Americans.

1009
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:38,872
That's true.

1010
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,641
It's said they can be so easily used.

1011
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:32,861
She's on her way.

1012
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,368
I'll see you in New York.

1013
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,911
- Where is she?
- We don't know.

1014
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:59,752
I swear to God, Fulbright,
if you've lost Fay we'll cripple you.

1015
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:03,525
It was me.

1016
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:05,160
My bright idea.

1017
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:07,062
To create a series of convincing forgeries...

1018
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:09,531
...of the confession Henry
was supposed to have composed

1019
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:11,934
for the interrogators in Chile back in '73.

1020
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:14,268
But the Russians caught on and followed suit.

1021
01:11:15,071 --> 01:11:16,071
And the British.

1022
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:16,906
So did the Chinese.

1023
01:11:16,907 --> 01:11:19,308
Pretty soon the Pakistanis got hold
of a German translation...

1024
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:22,311
...of a British forgery and followed
coded instructions found within it...

1025
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:24,042
...to build a nuclear bomb that almost worked.

1026
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:29,785
So you see, your Dad's masterpiece
is a collection of fakes...

1027
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,154
...of a book that has never itself been written.

1028
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:37,526
A self perpetuating literature of obfuscation,
hearsay... rumor,

1029
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:40,162
innuendo, and out right lies.

1030
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:41,296
A best seller for sure.

1031
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,931
Settle down, you lunatics!

1032
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:44,900
It's fucking psychological terrorism.

1033
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:46,733
A kind of germ warfare of the brain.

1034
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,938
And we've got to get our hands on...
...whoever's orchestrating this.

1035
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:50,773
Henry?

1036
01:11:50,774 --> 01:11:52,366
- Not necessarily.
- Who then?

1037
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:55,544
Yesterday a freelance Russian spy,

1038
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:59,414
an Iranian named Andre Soltani
was found shot to death in a Paris side street.

1039
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:00,882
You think there's a connection?

1040
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:03,952
Unfortunately, yes. I do.
Fay had been with him earlier in the day.

1041
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:04,921
So?

1042
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:11,883
You have anything to drink?

1043
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:19,263
Thank you.

1044
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:31,179
The bungled coup in South America got me in all
sorts of trouble with the brass back in Washington.

1045
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:36,619
And, well, for my sins,
I was sent to the middle of nowhere.

1046
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:42,524
Fulbright,
we're not clear on the American position.

1047
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,526
Yeah, well, neither am I.

1048
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:47,162
So, I've got to get over to the US Embassy...
...in Pakistan and find out.

1049
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,256
I'll be back in a few days.

1050
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:51,066
There may very well be a new government
here when you return.

1051
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:54,069
No. Andre, can I give you my own
personal estimation of things?

1052
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:54,804
Of course.

1053
01:12:54,805 --> 01:12:56,938
When the present government collapses,
there will be no new government.

1054
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:58,774
Only chaos. Unless...

1055
01:12:58,775 --> 01:12:59,542
Unless what?

1056
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:01,176
You've got to organize the rebels.

1057
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:05,137
Get someone now, before the shit
hits the fan, who's reasonable.

1058
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:09,651
And by reasonable you mean someone who
will do whatever the American's want him to do.

1059
01:13:09,652 --> 01:13:12,019
Yeah, well, maybe. Why not?

1060
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:15,891
Look, Fulbright, there are reasonable men.

1061
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:18,862
Even men who are not reasonable...
...but who will do whatever America wants.

1062
01:13:19,429 --> 01:13:21,663
But these are not the men
the people will listen to.

1063
01:13:21,664 --> 01:13:23,432
These are not the men the population will follow.

1064
01:13:23,433 --> 01:13:24,401
Who will they follow?

1065
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:26,861
Jallal Said Khan.

1066
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,630
And who's he when he's at home?

1067
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,840
A garbage man from Kandahar.

1068
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,176
He wrote this.

1069
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:35,177
What is it?

1070
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:36,178
A sort of manifesto,

1071
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:38,547
written under the guidance of a foreigner
who is his closest adviser.

1072
01:13:38,548 --> 01:13:40,141
- Here in Kabul?
- No. In Herat.

1073
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,418
The government had him imprisoned
for pornography as a result...

1074
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:44,910
...but I managed to get him released.

1075
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:48,280
It is a powerful document and
has attracted many followers to him.

1076
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:50,425
Where is he now?

1077
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,761
Jallal Said Khan?

1078
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:53,855
In the north.

1079
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:56,832
His group has been troublesome
for the Russians as they retreat.

1080
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:59,067
Capturing weapons and even some tanks, I hear.

1081
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:00,302
Is this foreigner with him?

1082
01:14:00,303 --> 01:14:01,134
It's hard to tell.

1083
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:02,897
Who is he? The foreigner?

1084
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:04,866
He got a name?

1085
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:08,878
No way!

1086
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:11,381
Incredible!

1087
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:14,816
And he was gone from Mazar e Sharif...
...when I got there 2 days later.

1088
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,752
But you found Jallal Said Kahn?

1089
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:18,820
Yeah. But I couldn't get near him.

1090
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:20,522
He was already an anti-western threat.

1091
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:22,791
Pressure from his allies forced him
to split with Henry...

1092
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:26,061
...whom our best intelligence has
crossing the border into Uzbekistan in 1989.

1093
01:14:26,062 --> 01:14:30,532
In the meantime, Said Kahn's
become a superstar Mujahedin...

1094
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:34,302
A sort of cowboy holy man with a stolen AK-47.

1095
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,304
You think Henry's working
with Said Khan again?

1096
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,639
Connect the dots, Simon.

1097
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,174
Henry to Khan, Khan to Andre.

1098
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:42,043
And now... well, Andre to Fay.

1099
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,945
- But surely you don't think...
- Yes, I do think.

1100
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:45,781
Just hold on a minute, Fulbright.

1101
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:46,750
Face it, Simon.

1102
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,016
Fay's gone over to the other side.

1103
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:51,147
The other side of what?

1104
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:53,889
The other side of the playing field, wise guy!

1105
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:55,423
Khan's operation has become a magnet...

1106
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,256
...for every anti-American
hoodlum in existence.

1107
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:00,160
You're saying you think Fay's a terrorist?

1108
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:04,399
Look, Simon, people do these things
for funny reasons.

1109
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,667
Love, for instance.

1110
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,769
I think
she'd do anything to be with Henry again.

1111
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:09,171
Sorry, Angus.

1112
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:11,869
You set her up, you sent her out there.

1113
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:13,873
She could've come back in.
Her work was done.

1114
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,182
Work with me.

1115
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:22,551
Tell me what you know.
No charges will be brought against her.

1116
01:15:22,552 --> 01:15:24,748
In the meantime,
she might lead us to Said Khan.

1117
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:25,885
What about Henry?

1118
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,256
You know where Fay is, don't you?

1119
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:32,427
What's the agency's directive regarding Henry?

1120
01:15:32,428 --> 01:15:33,162
I can't tell you that, Simon.

1121
01:15:33,163 --> 01:15:34,255
You're going to kill him.

1122
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:37,299
The guy's wanted for manslaughter

1123
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,031
and he might very well be collaborating
with international terrorists!

1124
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:45,841
Sir, Picard came to in Paris.

1125
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:51,136
He admitted they issued Fay a fake
passport under the name of a... Emily Hopper.

1126
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:53,048
Any leads?

1127
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:56,284
Yes, a Emily Hopper boarded a plane
in Paris this morning.

1128
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:57,116
Where to?

1129
01:16:01,824 --> 01:16:02,917
Istanbul.

1130
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:20,735
Thank you, Miss Hopper.

1131
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:23,870
When will the room be ready, you think?

1132
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:26,047
In about an hour.
Can we store your luggage?

1133
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:27,649
Yes. Just this one.

1134
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:28,481
Very well.

1135
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,299
Bebe, don't wander off like that.

1136
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,800
Can we buy some baklava?

1137
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,068
I'm so hungry.

1138
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:48,803
We haven't even had breakfast yet.
Come on.

1139
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,805
But it's good for breakfast! It's so sweet.

1140
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,941
With a nice cup of black coffee. Perfect.

1141
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,911
No. Come on. We don't have much time.

1142
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:04,486
Thank you, Miss Najinski.

1143
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:07,151
- Do you have any luggage?
- Yes, this one.

1144
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:14,886
Wait for my call.

1145
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:16,496
Don't leave the room.

1146
01:17:17,433 --> 01:17:18,628
Don't talk to anyone.

1147
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,509
Can I check my email anywhere?

1148
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:41,482
- Fulbright gone?
- Yeah.

1149
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:43,151
Go check your email.

1150
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:49,898
There she is!

1151
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:52,767
Palas Hotel. Istanbul. Room 315.

1152
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,170
She's got a good head start.
This is from 7 hours ago.

1153
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,901
Ned, go distract those guys in the van.

1154
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:02,177
As soon as I'm gone,
you call the hospital, right?

1155
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,373
Yeah. Yeah...

1156
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,254
Does this mean anything to you?

1157
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:18,426
No miss. It does not.

1158
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:21,158
It's not Turkish or Arabic or anything?

1159
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:24,264
Not miss, it is not.

1160
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,266
H F

1161
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:32,368
Is everything all right, miss?

1162
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:33,876
H-F.

1163
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:35,878
Excuse me?

1164
01:18:36,312 --> 01:18:37,644
It was upside down.

1165
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:41,613
It's the letters H, and F.

1166
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,384
Ahh yes, So it is. That explains it.

1167
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,023
- Explains what?
- What it is.

1168
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:49,156
- What is it?
- Initials.

1169
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:51,751
I know it's initials. But...

1170
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:54,857
whose initials are they?

1171
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:58,493
He's kind of a puppet, do you say.

1172
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:00,902
On strings and wires.

1173
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,633
Traditional. Very old.

1174
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,774
Here, I'll show you.

1175
01:19:05,775 --> 01:19:07,909
There is a shop in the bazaar near the palace...

1176
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,037
...just under the old harem.

1177
01:19:09,812 --> 01:19:12,372
I'll get you a taxi. He'll bring you there.

1178
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:24,891
Call the hospital.

1179
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,897
Yeah. Now go!

1180
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:41,776
So ahh... you really think your Mom likes me?

1181
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:42,904
Yeah. Definitely.

1182
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,547
What about this Angus guy?

1183
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:47,380
She just keeps him around for his money.

1184
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:49,718
Rich bastard, huh?

1185
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:51,186
He's okay.

1186
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:53,421
She's concerned about my education.

1187
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:55,914
Yeah, right. Yeah, I can understand that.

1188
01:21:16,172 --> 01:21:17,367
You are an American.

1189
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:20,271
Yes, I am.

1190
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:24,144
I can tell by the way you walk.

1191
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:29,852
Are you blind?

1192
01:21:30,653 --> 01:21:32,485
For many years. Yes.

1193
01:21:47,937 --> 01:21:49,633
There's always this character.

1194
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:52,139
The one with the big mouth.

1195
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:53,898
That's him.

1196
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,742
The "Harem Fool."

1197
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,376
That's our specialty.

1198
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,374
He is a popular story.

1199
01:22:02,952 --> 01:22:04,052
A legend.

1200
01:22:04,053 --> 01:22:05,749
Like Scheherazade.

1201
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:08,015
Many centuries ago...

1202
01:22:09,191 --> 01:22:11,524
...a stranger, a westerner,

1203
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:17,065
found his way
into the harem of the Sultan's palace.

1204
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:20,301
He had seduced all the sultan's concubines...

1205
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:22,537
...by the time he was discovered.

1206
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:27,542
The sultan was about to kill him
when the stranger asked...

1207
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:30,778
...to be allowed to confess
his sins before he died...

1208
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,881
...as he was, so he said... a Christian.

1209
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:36,184
The sultan was an open minded tyrant...

1210
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:40,188
...so he sent for a priest
from the Christian community...

1211
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:42,158
...just outside the city walls.

1212
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:49,530
The confession took many years
to complete because the stranger...

1213
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:54,068
...had committed so many sins
that the sultan couldn't believe it

1214
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:55,901
and always wanted to hear more.

1215
01:22:57,673 --> 01:23:03,408
Finally, everyone forgot that
he was a prisoner awaiting his death...

1216
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:07,274
...and he was thought of as the harem fool.

1217
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:13,746
I have one of these toys.

1218
01:23:16,292 --> 01:23:18,022
They are quite popular.

1219
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:23,855
Yes.

1220
01:23:29,405 --> 01:23:30,998
Have you been here before, then?

1221
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:39,273
No. I've never been here before.

1222
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:50,888
The toy was sent to me.

1223
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,357
By a friend, I think.

1224
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:07,604
What story does the toy tell?

1225
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:23,150
The toy tells the story...

1226
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:29,020
...of the harem fool...

1227
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:36,766
...seducing the sultan's concubines.

1228
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:53,622
You have come a long way
and put yourself in great danger.

1229
01:24:56,892 --> 01:24:57,723
Where is he?

1230
01:24:58,527 --> 01:24:59,495
Where is Henry?

1231
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,153
That is not for me to say.

1232
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:05,896
Lock the door and turn the sign around.

1233
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:08,497
Lower the blinds.

1234
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,743
Ghesam?

1235
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,642
Maybe we should call the hospital now.

1236
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,373
Nonsense. I'm fine.

1237
01:25:49,912 --> 01:25:52,280
If we call the hospital,
it'll alert what's his name out there...

1238
01:25:52,281 --> 01:25:53,781
- Carl...
- Yeah, Carl.

1239
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:55,883
They'll investigate and realize Simon's gone.

1240
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:57,876
Let's wait at least until he gets to Istanbul.

1241
01:26:28,951 --> 01:26:30,385
Now we must wait.

1242
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,251
Where am I?

1243
01:26:32,888 --> 01:26:34,188
You do not want to know that, Fay.

1244
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,282
What's going to happen?

1245
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:38,526
A man will talk to you.

1246
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,359
Answer his questions honestly.

1247
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:42,430
And remember not to ask questions.

1248
01:26:42,431 --> 01:26:43,831
Will he take me to Henry?

1249
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:45,900
Don't be impatient.

1250
01:26:45,901 --> 01:26:47,668
Answer his questions.

1251
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:49,638
If necessary, ask for his guidance.

1252
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:52,498
We may have to wait some time.

1253
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:56,811
Miss Hopper registered, left her luggage
and said she was going for a walk.

1254
01:26:56,812 --> 01:26:58,179
Where's her luggage?

1255
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:00,281
- In her room.
- We need to examine that luggage.

1256
01:27:00,282 --> 01:27:03,116
I can not let you into her room.
That is against hotel policy.

1257
01:27:04,653 --> 01:27:05,920
We'll need to get the locals involved.

1258
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:07,788
Notify the police.

1259
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:08,916
Watch all the entrances.

1260
01:27:36,652 --> 01:27:38,143
What is it you have come here for?

1261
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,848
I'm looking for my husband.

1262
01:27:45,661 --> 01:27:46,629
Your husband.

1263
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:47,863
What is his name?

1264
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:52,902
Henry.

1265
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,869
How is it you have come to lose your husband.

1266
01:28:10,552 --> 01:28:11,520
He ran away.

1267
01:28:14,423 --> 01:28:15,254
He was in trouble.

1268
01:28:18,827 --> 01:28:19,851
I see.

1269
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:28,268
And has this trouble passed?

1270
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:35,138
No.

1271
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:39,907
He's still in trouble then?

1272
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:42,714
Yes.

1273
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:48,490
You want to protect him from these troubles?

1274
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:51,885
If I can.

1275
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,258
You want to share these troubles with him?

1276
01:28:58,533 --> 01:28:59,728
If I have to.

1277
01:29:12,881 --> 01:29:14,247
Where do you intend to look for him?

1278
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:32,267
I was hoping you might choose to advise me.

1279
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:42,378
You can go now.

1280
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:14,873
It's nothing. Just clothes.

1281
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:22,481
Okay. Come on.

1282
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,382
About fucking time, your Excellency!

1283
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:04,623
Where's the new stove you promised me!

1284
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:07,762
Hey, scum bag, go get me some more wood!

1285
01:31:07,763 --> 01:31:09,764
I'll freeze to death in here, Jallal,

1286
01:31:09,765 --> 01:31:11,859
and then you'll have that on your conscience too.

1287
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,602
How goes the jihad you cheap fuck!

1288
01:31:25,547 --> 01:31:27,782
Why can't you find
a nice kerosene heater somewhere?

1289
01:31:27,783 --> 01:31:30,417
Save you from having to chop up
the furniture to keeps us warm.

1290
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:33,149
It's only you who needs to be kept so warm.

1291
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:35,289
I mean, if I were a world famous terrorist.

1292
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:37,850
I am not, a world famous terrorist.

1293
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:39,857
Yeah, and whose fault is that?

1294
01:31:42,297 --> 01:31:44,899
And... and... where are those books I asked for?

1295
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,893
This is cruel and unusual punishment,
my friend.

1296
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:51,405
If the opinion of the world
is of no consequence to you

1297
01:31:51,406 --> 01:31:54,775
I'd think you'd at least have enough...
self-respect to act like a gentleman.

1298
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:57,645
You are not of course now suggesting
that you are a gentleman?

1299
01:31:57,646 --> 01:32:01,845
Hey! I was suave enough in my day.

1300
01:32:02,951 --> 01:32:07,655
I've lost a little of my polish,
it's true, stuck down here in this vault.

1301
01:32:07,656 --> 01:32:09,190
And for what?

1302
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:10,791
For being a friend to you!

1303
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:13,284
Exactly, for being a friend to me.

1304
01:32:16,932 --> 01:32:18,666
You know where I am.

1305
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:20,499
No one can know where I am.

1306
01:32:20,936 --> 01:32:22,169
Besides, I've needed you.

1307
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:24,905
That's really mighty white of you, Jallal.

1308
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:26,941
I suppose you lock up everyone you need.

1309
01:32:26,942 --> 01:32:28,638
Incarcerate all your friends.

1310
01:32:29,311 --> 01:32:30,644
If I have to, yes.

1311
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:31,874
There's too much at stake.

1312
01:32:33,415 --> 01:32:38,285
Listen. The wood, the books,
materials of every kind...

1313
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:39,481
...they've been hard to get.

1314
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:42,481
Our supplies have been cut off.

1315
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:47,023
We're hoping for support from
our contacts across the border in Iran

1316
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:49,858
I may have to return.

1317
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:52,867
- To Afghanistan?
- Yes.

1318
01:32:59,307 --> 01:33:00,275
Are you crazy?

1319
01:33:01,776 --> 01:33:04,871
The time has come to stop hiding.

1320
01:33:07,883 --> 01:33:08,851
You'll be decimated.

1321
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:16,013
There will be set backs, losses, I agree.
In the short run.

1322
01:33:17,192 --> 01:33:18,285
But in the long run...

1323
01:33:18,894 --> 01:33:20,661
They will see we can manage.

1324
01:33:20,662 --> 01:33:22,756
They will not be able to beat us down forever.

1325
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:25,165
There is a better way.

1326
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:27,668
Even you... even you came back, Henry.

1327
01:33:27,669 --> 01:33:29,865
I was just passing through, Jallal.

1328
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:34,174
I was in trouble and you owed me favors,
whether you care to admit it or not.

1329
01:33:34,175 --> 01:33:36,543
Don't pin any medals on me, please.

1330
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:38,178
Besides, that's just the way I am.

1331
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:40,814
I gravitate to the lowest
common denominator.

1332
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:41,908
On principle.

1333
01:33:42,417 --> 01:33:45,751
Go ahead. Insult me.

1334
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:48,520
There was a time when you said
I could do no wrong.

1335
01:33:48,924 --> 01:33:50,256
It's true.

1336
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,158
You were extraordinary.

1337
01:33:52,761 --> 01:33:55,663
I don't pretend to understand either
your religion or your politics.

1338
01:33:55,664 --> 01:33:57,831
...but you used to be a sensible dude.

1339
01:33:57,832 --> 01:34:01,535
And now look, me... your best friend.
I'm your prisoner.

1340
01:34:01,536 --> 01:34:04,171
Henry, you're a fugitive criminal.

1341
01:34:04,172 --> 01:34:05,367
An alleged murderer.

1342
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:08,809
A mistake. I regret it.

1343
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:10,244
But what's done is done.

1344
01:34:10,545 --> 01:34:14,181
Of course, when you came to me,
desperate and hurt... I took you in.

1345
01:34:14,182 --> 01:34:18,882
But now our friendship is well known
to intelligence agencies all over the world.

1346
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:21,922
Go ahead and complain about it
why don't ya'...

1347
01:34:21,923 --> 01:34:26,927
And now you are not merely a wanted criminal,
but are suspected of being an American traitor.

1348
01:34:26,928 --> 01:34:30,064
Some of their best citizens
have been described thusly.

1349
01:34:30,065 --> 01:34:33,399
But, now, the worst thing possible...
you're famous!

1350
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:42,633
A legend. Yes, the mythic mentor
of the notorious Simon Grim.

1351
01:34:46,047 --> 01:34:47,743
- Really?
- It's true.

1352
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:51,381
A new trend. A sensation even.
We saw it on CNN.

1353
01:34:59,427 --> 01:35:00,156
You see!

1354
01:35:00,829 --> 01:35:04,766
They have to bludgeon a man into obscurity
before they'll acknowledge his genius!

1355
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:07,627
It's a ploy.

1356
01:35:07,902 --> 01:35:08,870
A what?

1357
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:12,773
The CIA suspects that if they find you,
You will lead them to me.

1358
01:35:12,774 --> 01:35:15,409
Yes, of course, it's all about you Jallal!

1359
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:16,901
But Henry, it is.

1360
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:19,413
You arrogant bastard!

1361
01:35:19,414 --> 01:35:21,181
You didn't even know how to talk
when I met you!

1362
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:23,151
You were afraid of your own fucking shadow!

1363
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:28,918
Your past is catching up with you.

1364
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:48,809
- Fulbright?
- Yes.

1365
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:50,142
That fuck...

1366
01:35:53,882 --> 01:35:54,713
How?

1367
01:35:56,951 --> 01:35:57,919
Sit down.

1368
01:36:07,529 --> 01:36:08,497
What?

1369
01:36:10,432 --> 01:36:11,525
She's here.

1370
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:14,630
Whose here?

1371
01:36:14,803 --> 01:36:15,827
Fay.

1372
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:24,945
- Are you kidding me!
- It's true.

1373
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:26,814
Shit! You gotta comb?

1374
01:36:26,815 --> 01:36:29,950
No, wait. Hold on!
How the Hell did she find me?

1375
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:31,283
We sent for her.

1376
01:36:34,055 --> 01:36:34,886
Why?

1377
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,919
She seems to love you very much.

1378
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:42,763
No... Did she say that?

1379
01:36:42,764 --> 01:36:43,493
Forget it...

1380
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:48,270
Henry, I have to go

1381
01:36:48,937 --> 01:36:49,563
Jallal!

1382
01:36:50,772 --> 01:36:53,503
Fulbright was using her to draw me out.

1383
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:54,776
And it worked?

1384
01:36:54,777 --> 01:36:57,544
She caught on early enough... and tricked him.

1385
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:59,179
But he's catching up with her too.

1386
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:00,614
You can't do this.

1387
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:03,784
Jallal, you can't bring Fay
into all this madness.

1388
01:37:03,785 --> 01:37:06,787
She's already in all this madness.
You yourself made sure of that.

1389
01:37:06,788 --> 01:37:08,422
Hey! I just fell in love with her.

1390
01:37:08,423 --> 01:37:11,621
I didn't send her a note...
...and ask her to join some half-assed jihad!

1391
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:17,162
Henry, it's difficult to be your friend.

1392
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,767
Yeah, well stand in line, pal

1393
01:37:20,768 --> 01:37:26,139
We called Fay here to take you away rather
than to put you in front of a firing squad.

1394
01:37:46,161 --> 01:37:48,662
- My friend...
- I am not just your friend.

1395
01:37:48,663 --> 01:37:50,664
I don't make decisions by fiat.

1396
01:37:50,665 --> 01:37:54,067
I have protected you over
the last three years from the justified...

1397
01:37:54,068 --> 01:37:57,771
...if somewhat reactionary elements
of my administration.

1398
01:37:57,772 --> 01:38:00,541
They would have killed you back in 1989.

1399
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:02,033
...if I hadn't sent you away.

1400
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:07,915
Every decision I make has consequences
I can barely stand to carry.

1401
01:38:11,186 --> 01:38:12,745
I am not a man any longer.

1402
01:38:14,822 --> 01:38:15,915
I am an instrument.

1403
01:38:18,426 --> 01:38:19,257
A pity.

1404
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:22,387
I prefer it that way.

1405
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:25,395
Go ahead.

1406
01:38:27,535 --> 01:38:28,867
Martyr yourself.

1407
01:38:33,942 --> 01:38:35,137
Die a saint.

1408
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:39,403
Yes, of course... I can see right through you.

1409
01:38:45,286 --> 01:38:48,822
If anything happens to Fay, Jallal...

1410
01:38:48,823 --> 01:38:53,921
...I'll torture your wives, your family,
your children and their children.

1411
01:38:55,163 --> 01:38:57,997
There'll be a disease upon this earth
with your name on it.

1412
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,803
The only thing anyone will inherit
from Jallal Said Khan...

1413
01:39:02,804 --> 01:39:06,366
...is a long life time of intolerable pain.

1414
01:39:12,547 --> 01:39:13,378
Sorry.

1415
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:17,115
That's just the kind of guy I am.

1416
01:39:38,406 --> 01:39:42,542
Hello. I'd like to leave a note
for my friend in room 315.

1417
01:39:42,543 --> 01:39:43,374
Yes, sir.

1418
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:53,485
Thanks.

1419
01:40:05,533 --> 01:40:06,501
Do you know who I am?

1420
01:40:08,069 --> 01:40:09,401
No.

1421
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:10,400
Good.

1422
01:40:12,073 --> 01:40:13,405
Do you know where you are?

1423
01:40:16,311 --> 01:40:17,142
Not really.

1424
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:20,111
Turkey?

1425
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:22,384
Fair enough.

1426
01:40:23,951 --> 01:40:25,385
I'm a friend of Henry's.

1427
01:40:27,055 --> 01:40:28,023
Oh good.

1428
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:32,426
I am also an enemy of the United States.

1429
01:40:32,427 --> 01:40:36,523
I don't keep count, but I've killed
at least hundreds of your fellow citizens.

1430
01:40:37,065 --> 01:40:40,160
Many, many more of your soldiers
and professional spies.

1431
01:40:47,809 --> 01:40:49,243
May we continue talking?

1432
01:40:53,648 --> 01:40:54,479
Okay.

1433
01:41:01,923 --> 01:41:03,118
Did you kill Andre?

1434
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:05,857
- No! I...
- I believe you.

1435
01:41:07,428 --> 01:41:08,623
Did he give you anything?

1436
01:41:11,165 --> 01:41:12,895
Two books of Henry's confession.

1437
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:16,996
Good. Are they with you?

1438
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:20,001
At the hotel.

1439
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:26,609
Fay...

1440
01:41:27,949 --> 01:41:30,885
Henry is a wanted man
in more ways than you know.

1441
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:34,614
Can I see him?

1442
01:41:36,057 --> 01:41:37,150
Is he all right?

1443
01:41:37,892 --> 01:41:38,860
He's safe.

1444
01:41:40,061 --> 01:41:40,892
But not for long.

1445
01:41:42,296 --> 01:41:44,891
You said you would share
his troubles and protect him.

1446
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:48,498
The time has come for you to do that.

1447
01:41:53,541 --> 01:41:54,409
You must decide.

1448
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:56,901
If you wanna to be with him, you must decide.

1449
01:41:58,179 --> 01:41:59,613
There will be no turning back.

1450
01:42:01,549 --> 01:42:04,041
He is an exile.
You, too, will be an exile.

1451
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:06,879
You will not be able to go home again.

1452
01:42:13,761 --> 01:42:15,127
I understand

1453
01:42:28,176 --> 01:42:32,179
Hasan will give you directions
to a certain pier on the Bosporus.

1454
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:36,140
At 6:15 this evening a boat will dock
for a few minutes at this pier.

1455
01:42:37,051 --> 01:42:38,051
Be there.

1456
01:42:38,052 --> 01:42:39,145
Get on the boat.

1457
01:42:40,054 --> 01:42:42,823
Henry and you will be taken up
into the Black Sea

1458
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:44,524
and sometime tomorrow...

1459
01:42:44,525 --> 01:42:48,485
...you will be transferred to another vessel,
bound for Odessa.

1460
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:55,392
I'm afraid from there on,
you are on your own.

1461
01:43:17,892 --> 01:43:22,262
Fay, please, when we drive off,
stand where you are and count to twenty.

1462
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:25,766
- Do you understand the directions I gave you?
- Yes.

1463
01:43:42,183 --> 01:43:52,182
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

1464
01:44:21,889 --> 01:44:23,255
Excuse me, where is the men's room.

1465
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:25,359
To the right of the elevator.

1466
01:44:38,673 --> 01:44:39,402
Who are you?

1467
01:44:40,174 --> 01:44:41,904
Are you really Simon Grim?

1468
01:44:43,544 --> 01:44:44,375
Where's Fay?

1469
01:45:04,832 --> 01:45:06,528
She should have been back by now.

1470
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:08,895
She told me to wait.

1471
01:45:14,642 --> 01:45:15,909
Who are you, what's your name?

1472
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:17,410
I am Bebe Konchalowsky, okay?

1473
01:45:17,411 --> 01:45:20,046
But only sometimes.
I am mostly Olga Najinsky.

1474
01:45:20,047 --> 01:45:22,744
And I am very hungry.
Can I get something to eat please?

1475
01:45:32,793 --> 01:45:33,761
Hello?

1476
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:34,761
Simon!

1477
01:45:48,943 --> 01:45:52,141
Get your stuff.
I'll meet you in the lobby in five minutes.

1478
01:45:54,048 --> 01:45:57,283
Yes. Grim, Fay. US passport.
Or Hopper, Emily. Same.

1479
01:45:57,284 --> 01:45:58,551
No. I'm sorry. No one.

1480
01:45:58,552 --> 01:45:59,886
She may have been traveling
with another women.

1481
01:45:59,887 --> 01:46:02,522
A Russian passport.
Possibly registered as Konchalovsky. Bebe.

1482
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:05,191
- No. No Konchalovsky.
- What about Chekov. Ilyanna?

1483
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:06,292
No. No Chekov.

1484
01:46:06,293 --> 01:46:08,662
Tchiakovsky. Bernadette.
Maybe a Danish passport.

1485
01:46:08,663 --> 01:46:10,495
- Possibly Sweden.
- No.

1486
01:46:11,766 --> 01:46:12,597
How about Olga?

1487
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:15,168
- Just Olga?
- Yeah. No family name. Just Olga.

1488
01:46:15,169 --> 01:46:17,001
- Najinsky.
- First name Olga?

1489
01:46:18,906 --> 01:46:21,137
Najinsky, Olga.

1490
01:46:21,409 --> 01:46:22,409
Russian passport.

1491
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:23,844
Room 315! Okay, let's go!

1492
01:46:25,413 --> 01:46:27,382
I listened to you when I was in misery.

1493
01:46:28,783 --> 01:46:30,012
When I was lost.

1494
01:46:31,819 --> 01:46:34,846
And it helped me to see the light and to win.

1495
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:41,752
But when I was winning,
I chose not to hear you anymore.

1496
01:46:43,764 --> 01:46:44,595
I know...

1497
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:53,897
And I'm sorry for that.

1498
01:47:17,932 --> 01:47:18,900
Where's Bebe?

1499
01:47:24,538 --> 01:47:25,538
Where is Fay?

1500
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:26,734
I don't know.

1501
01:47:27,408 --> 01:47:30,410
Perhaps you would prefer being handed over
to our Russian Associate here...

1502
01:47:30,411 --> 01:47:32,645
...and being taken back
to face charges in Chechnya?

1503
01:47:32,646 --> 01:47:33,880
Please! Enough!

1504
01:47:33,881 --> 01:47:34,948
Bebe..

1505
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:39,786
My government will offer you and Fay diplomatic
asylum if you can lead us to Henry Fool.

1506
01:47:39,787 --> 01:47:42,188
Hold on, what is this?

1507
01:47:42,189 --> 01:47:43,656
- Fulbright?
- Picard, you can't do that.

1508
01:47:43,657 --> 01:47:45,023
Fay's an American citizen!

1509
01:47:50,431 --> 01:47:52,024
Only Fay has this number.

1510
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:55,895
Come on, let's do it then.

1511
01:47:56,303 --> 01:47:57,032
Fay?

1512
01:47:57,772 --> 01:47:58,865
Put Bebe on.

1513
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:01,407
I can't. It's dangerous right now.

1514
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:02,501
I'll call you back.

1515
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:04,608
No.

1516
01:48:05,646 --> 01:48:06,739
She's not letting me.

1517
01:48:09,283 --> 01:48:10,251
Put Bebe on.

1518
01:48:20,928 --> 01:48:24,126
Fay... don't let them send me away.

1519
01:48:24,765 --> 01:48:27,860
Bebe, no one is going to hurt you.

1520
01:48:29,069 --> 01:48:30,264
Do you understand me?

1521
01:48:30,771 --> 01:48:32,906
- But they...
- They will let you go.

1522
01:48:32,907 --> 01:48:33,897
I promise.

1523
01:48:36,043 --> 01:48:36,874
When they do...

1524
01:48:38,045 --> 01:48:39,741
...go to where the sweet things are.

1525
01:48:40,881 --> 01:48:41,849
Understand?

1526
01:48:43,551 --> 01:48:45,383
If you understand don't say anything.

1527
01:48:45,653 --> 01:48:46,484
Understand?

1528
01:48:50,658 --> 01:48:51,751
Put Fulbright on.

1529
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:02,893
Fay, let me bring you in.
This has gotten out of hand.

1530
01:49:03,771 --> 01:49:04,602
Let Bebe go.

1531
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:08,270
Where is Jallal Said Khan?

1532
01:49:10,311 --> 01:49:12,779
I don't know. Nearby. I think.
But he's going away.

1533
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,781
Khan's nearby and he's on the move.

1534
01:49:14,782 --> 01:49:16,182
Fulbright, let her go, she's unimportant.

1535
01:49:16,183 --> 01:49:18,184
No! Where's Fool?

1536
01:49:18,185 --> 01:49:20,518
We need Fool! You don't understand!

1537
01:49:20,788 --> 01:49:24,924
We cannot help suppress related
terror groups if Khan is not in custody.

1538
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:25,893
We must have Khan.

1539
01:49:25,894 --> 01:49:28,828
Fay, you're in no real position
to strong arm anybody, you know.

1540
01:49:28,829 --> 01:49:30,627
Bebe has told us everything.

1541
01:49:42,309 --> 01:49:45,905
Listen, you jerk,
that entire building is wired to explode.

1542
01:49:47,815 --> 01:49:48,908
Bomb threat.

1543
01:49:51,185 --> 01:49:52,278
She's bluffing.

1544
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:57,523
Maybe, but she's been able
to make contact with Said Khan.

1545
01:49:57,524 --> 01:49:59,058
None of us in London have managed that.

1546
01:49:59,059 --> 01:50:01,893
Not even us, with all our contacts in Moscow.

1547
01:50:02,162 --> 01:50:04,859
It seems she's better connected
than we imagined.

1548
01:50:06,066 --> 01:50:07,400
Shit, what now?

1549
01:50:07,401 --> 01:50:10,069
Sir, the power's been cut.
All communications are down.

1550
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:11,804
Fay, listen... take it easy.

1551
01:50:11,805 --> 01:50:13,640
Let Bebe go. Now!

1552
01:50:13,641 --> 01:50:15,909
And if anyone else leaves
that building before 15 minutes...

1553
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:18,038
...the entire place explodes. Got it?

1554
01:50:18,312 --> 01:50:20,144
Okay. Where are the books?

1555
01:50:22,650 --> 01:50:23,879
Let Bebe leave the building.

1556
01:50:28,188 --> 01:50:29,188
She's gone.

1557
01:50:29,189 --> 01:50:30,189
Give me that quick...

1558
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:32,750
Call back the number.
We'll have the exact coordinates.

1559
01:51:22,776 --> 01:51:23,607
Angus?

1560
01:51:42,830 --> 01:51:44,628
Wait! They've got Khan!

1561
01:51:45,299 --> 01:51:46,899
- Where?
- In Diyarbakir.

1562
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,167
On his way to the border with Iran.

1563
01:51:48,168 --> 01:51:50,262
- Captured?
- Surrounded. He's wounded.

1564
01:51:51,171 --> 01:51:52,503
You must keep him alive!

1565
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:54,040
