1
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,850
Fuck it.

2
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,349
One or two?

3
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:42,948
I beg your pardon?

4
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:44,748
One or two?

5
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:50,347
What am I supposed to say?
-Home win or away win?

6
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:56,446
Let's say... away win.
-Really?

7
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,545
OK. I'll listen to you.
Let's see if you bring me any luck.

8
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:10,244
Experience?
-I worked two years at Pita's.

9
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:13,944
Until the cafe was closed.
-And the owner!!!

10
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:23,942
Night shifts?
-I can. No problem.

11
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:27,742
You have a husband,
child... that stuff? -No.

12
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:32,841
Only fools have children at this
time and day. What's your name?

13
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:35,741
Esma.

14
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,941
Mom.

15
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:41,742
Mom.

16
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:00,037
No, mom!
I'll wet my pants!

17
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:26,333
That's it. -Stop it.
-I have won.

18
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,833
Sara. Stop it.

19
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:36,232
Do you hear me?
Stop it!

20
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,030
Go and get ready.
You 'll be late to school.

21
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:23,825
What's your problem?!

22
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:42,122
Hit her!
Now!

23
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:48,221
Enough! Stop it!

24
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:51,221
What happened?
Stop it!

25
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,820
She hit me first!
-He started it!

26
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,920
Why do you play a men's sport?

27
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,220
You kick me because I am a better
player. -Enough. Come on, a kiss.

28
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,119
What? -Kiss each other.

29
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,819
No way! -He's gay!
-What?!

30
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:11,218
I want your parents to come
tomorrow! Yours too!

31
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:15,118
My mom is sick.
-Your father can come then.

32
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:17,917
Sara does not have a dad.

33
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:21,317
My dad is a shaheed (martyr).

34
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:24,216
Your mom can come.
When she feels better.

35
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:28,016
Come on now. Hurry up.
Go to your classrooms!

36
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,111
<i>I've waited for somebody
just like you</i>

37
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:06,010
<i>to have you wrapped
around my finger.</i>

38
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,609
<i>I wont't be sorry,
no, not at all</i>

39
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:14,209
<i>if I make you cry.</i>

40
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:19,808
<i>-All these years you would give
for just one night</i>

41
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:25,207
<i>but you can not have me
I'm going to the other one...</i>

42
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:37,597
Do you have anything... ?
-No really, I don't. -Nothing?

43
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:43,696
I need 200 EUR for Sara's school
trip. By the end of this week.

44
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:49,795
We'll get the money somehow.
Make it a bit tighter here.

45
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:56,494
You know how many of us
will come to the school reunion?

46
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:00,893
Eleven! Only 11 people out of 41.

47
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:05,293
Those who were not wasted
left the country. -I won't go.

48
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:09,192
Yes, you will, I tell you.
-No. I have to work.

49
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:13,192
You always have an excuse!
You must come! -Be quiet!

50
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:20,791
You want me to narrow it more?
Or make it loose... Sabina! Hey.

51
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,089
Fine, I'll come.
-You'll lie! -No.

52
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:32,889
I give you my young pioneer's
word. -Swear on Tito's name.

53
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:37,788
Come on, turn around.

54
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:40,788
So, do you want it looser
or tighter? -Make it looser.

55
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:42,787
You can see the love handles.

56
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:11,383
Hey!

57
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:17,282
What do you want?

58
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,082
Come here.

59
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:22,782
No, you come here.

60
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,678
My dad is a shaheed (martyr) too.

61
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,174
Sometimes I dream
that same voice

62
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:20,973
I don't see the face, but I
can hear the voice saying

63
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:25,473
"You have five minutes
to leave the house!"

64
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:31,572
I try to cram a plastic bag
with my mom's photographs

65
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:35,371
but they just fell through
and fall to the floor.

66
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:39,570
I look down and I see my mom
smiling at me. God forbid.

67
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,169
When I sleep,
I dream our house...

68
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:54,268
the way it used to be.

69
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:59,468
Beige walls,
hardwood woodwork

70
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,767
doors, windows...
My Ismet made it all himself.

71
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:09,366
And when I'm awake,
I can't see our house.

72
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:13,866
I can't remember
Ismet's face...

73
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,765
not even my child's face.

74
00:12:22,564 --> 00:12:25,764
And now, as you speak, Vasvija?
-Come on, cut the crap!

75
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:27,963
Give us some money
or work if there's any.

76
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:39,062
Not everybody shares your opinion
about the centre.

77
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:44,961
Some women have the need
to talk about their feelings.

78
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:53,960
Being reticent is the worst
thing we can do.

79
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:01,259
Some of you have never spoken
about what happened to them.

80
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:06,958
But my experience tells that there
can be no healing without talking.

81
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,657
And... there's no work
at the moment.

82
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:16,956
There's work for you!
You are taken care of!

83
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:30,254
It's OK Dzemilla!

84
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:33,854
Continue!

85
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:45,452
Esma Halilovic.
-Esma!

86
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:51,751
It is eighty now.
Less than before.

87
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:55,051
It's better than nothing.

88
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:08,349
Can I ask you...

89
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,648
Is there any way for me to
get an advance payment?

90
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:16,848
Sara is going on a school-trip...
-No, please don't !

91
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:23,147
I get monthly grants for all of you.
There's no way to pay in advance.

92
00:14:24,147 --> 00:14:26,946
OK. Thank you.
-Esma.

93
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:33,645
You should come to the Center more
often, not only when money is given.

94
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:38,844
Why? You have enough
nutcases without me around.

95
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:47,643
One trout.
A bigger one.

96
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:53,642
Trout is Sara's favorite.

97
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,438
Yummy!
Something smells nice.

98
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:31,437
Hi.
-Go wash your hands.

99
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:38,236
How was school?
-Fine.

100
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:43,335
What about Geography?
-The teacher didn't call my name.

101
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,835
The teacher wanted us to talk
about book assignments.

102
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:54,034
He wanted Keno
to answer a lesson.

103
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:57,933
Keno just kept silent.
Oh... -Yes.

104
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:01,932
Suddenly, he fell to the floor.
We all stood up.

105
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:05,232
So, Keno was on the floor,
saliva coming out of his mouth.

106
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:11,731
The teacher sent Amer to call an
ambulance but Keno just stood up.

107
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:15,430
You understand?
-No.

108
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,930
He was pretending. -Come on,
eat. It will get cold.

109
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:25,429
It's good, isn't it?
-It's great.

110
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,928
I don't know if they'll let
Keno go on the school trip.

111
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:32,828
It has to be paid by
the end of the week.

112
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:40,627
Keno said that he would go even
if they don't let him go with us.

113
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:44,826
What's with your nails?

114
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:50,825
Go cut your nails.
-The meal will get cold...

115
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:51,825
Now!

116
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:04,423
I don't know how to cut
the nails on my right hand.

117
00:17:14,222 --> 00:17:15,222
Oh, mom!

118
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,820
It's got cold.
-Eat it!

119
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,519
No. It's cold now.
-I told you to eat!

120
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,319
No, I will not!

121
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,618
You are late!

122
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:44,618
There is your work wear.
Change your clothes.

123
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:09,214
If you listen to me,
show your tits.

124
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:12,414
You'll get more tips.

125
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:32,911
You see... God gave women their
bodies so they rule the world.

126
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,610
But they don't use it.

127
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:43,309
Help me.

128
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:54,307
Jabolka.

129
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:59,607
Esma? -Esma from Bosnia?

130
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,906
Yes. -It's as bad as being
a Ukrainian!

131
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:20,904
Thanks.

132
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:26,694
Go to sleep! Turn the light
off. Do you hear me?

133
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:44,691
Out of my room! -If only you
were my, I would show you.

134
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:46,891
You spinster!

135
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,390
That poor woman,
why did God punished her so?

136
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,689
You stupid cow!

137
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,180
Are you OK?
-Yes.

138
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:11,579
Are you sure?
-I am.

139
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:33,176
You need a ride?
-No, thank you.

140
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:42,674
Come on. Get in.
Don't shilly-shally.

141
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:54,573
How did you bet on Valencia vs. Real?
-One, home win.

142
00:22:55,772 --> 00:23:00,072
You?
-Bloody two.

143
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:03,271
Only a fool can bet on an
away win with Real.

144
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:06,171
How many double picks
do you have? -Six.

145
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:10,070
What about Saran?
-He's got 12.

146
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,170
He'll miss them all again.

147
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:21,669
Where to? - Grbavica.
-I live at Grbavica too.

148
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,468
We'll drive Cenga home first.

149
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:28,768
I could have won big time with
Real's away win. -You didn't.

150
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,267
Fuck them all!
Stupid phonies.

151
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:15,761
We are at Grbavica.

152
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,860
Sorry. I just...

153
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,860
Thank you. Good night.
-See you.

154
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,958
I think I know you from
somewhere. -I don't know.

155
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:39,657
You are. -We've seen
each other in 'America'.

156
00:24:40,357 --> 00:24:43,757
I know. But that's when
I realized I know you.

157
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,356
Where do you go out?
-I don't go out. Nowhere.

158
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:50,256
Do you come to identifications?

159
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:56,055
I used to come.
-That's where I know you from!

160
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:59,454
Who are you looking for?

161
00:25:00,654 --> 00:25:04,954
I already found... my father.
And you?

162
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:07,553
I'm looking for my old man too.

163
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:10,453
You haven't found him yet?
-No.

164
00:25:11,353 --> 00:25:15,052
I was once sure I had found him.
A hundred corpses were excavated.

165
00:25:16,152 --> 00:25:20,251
I saw on one corpse the same watch
as my father used to have.

166
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,651
I looked at his feet and
saw the same black shoes

167
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:26,451
that he was wearing
when he left the house.

168
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,450
I was sure it was him.
I started crying and talking to him.

169
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,849
Suddenly a woman jumped in
and said: "Father, my father!"

170
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:41,548
I said: "Hey, how do you know
this is your father?" She said:

171
00:25:42,348 --> 00:25:46,348
"I recognized his watch, the shoes
and the golden tooth."

172
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:50,647
She opened his mouth
to look at the teeth.

173
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:53,447
I forgot to do that.

174
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:57,446
I liked the man as if
he had been my dad.

175
00:25:58,146 --> 00:26:00,046
I even went to his funeral.

176
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:06,445
Two more mass graves will be
excavated here around Grbavica.

177
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:10,544
I hope my dad
will be among them.

178
00:26:15,343 --> 00:26:20,743
Why am I bothering you with his?
-You are not bothering me. No.

179
00:26:25,442 --> 00:26:27,642
You want us to cruise
around the city?

180
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:29,941
I am tired.
I need to go.

181
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:37,240
Come on, we won't be long.
-Some other time.

182
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,940
I did bore you.

183
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,639
No, really. I'm just tired.
I have to get some sleep.

184
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,539
Good night.
-See you.

185
00:28:31,424 --> 00:28:35,923
Writing poetry is very hard,
not everybody can write.

186
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:40,722
I will recite a poem grand
because school trip is around.

187
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:51,021
If your parent is a shaheed, bring
cerfiticate, money you don't need.

188
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:59,420
If your parent was disabled in war,
a discount is what you should aim for.

189
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,819
We wish our kids to travel safely
and enjoy school-trip greatly!

190
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:16,917
Tell me a city and a number.

191
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:18,717
Paris. Seven.

192
00:29:22,716 --> 00:29:25,216
Sara! How is your mom?

193
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:33,116
Oh, what's wrong with her?

194
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:37,114
Cancer.
-Cancer?!

195
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:41,514
Come on, don't cry.

196
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:42,913
Be brave!

197
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:50,612
My aunt died of cancer.

198
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:53,212
I don't give a damn!

199
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,109
Where are my yellow socks?
-In the bathroom.

200
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:18,208
Get the laundry out of the
washing machine please.

201
00:30:19,908 --> 00:30:23,008
Those who bring certificates
pay just some of the price.

202
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,607
For what?
-For the school trip.

203
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:30,706
What certificate?

204
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,606
That my dad is shaheed (martyr).

205
00:30:36,606 --> 00:30:38,605
But they still have not find the body.

206
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,305
You can give me a certificate
that he was a soldier.

207
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:44,304
All right
I will find it!

208
00:30:47,704 --> 00:30:49,404
I have to take it to the school
now.

209
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:54,003
I have to find it first.
-Well, find it now.

210
00:30:56,903 --> 00:30:58,802
Come on, Sara.
It's not burning!

211
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:30,998
Esma! -Aunt!

212
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:36,597
Dear girl. I just come from Mula's
tehvid. You know Jusuf's wife?

213
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:42,296
Good day. -Hello, dear. -You go.
I'll be with you in a minute.

214
00:31:42,896 --> 00:31:44,996
She's the spitting image
of your late mother.

215
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:51,095
That's life. Your mom thought you
would be a doctor and get married.

216
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:55,694
She wanted a grandchild so much.
Maybe it's good she didn't live

217
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:58,494
to see this one.
Sorry, Esma.

218
00:31:58,994 --> 00:32:02,493
Sorry, I give you hard time.
-It's OK.

219
00:32:03,193 --> 00:32:07,192
Sara goes on a school-trip.
-Really? That's great!

220
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:13,292
I haven't got my salary yet.
Can you lend me some...

221
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:18,391
I would pay you back quickly.
-Yes.

222
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:22,790
You know how small pensions are.
If it weren't for Harun,

223
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,490
who rarely sends some money from
America, I would starve to death.

224
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:30,489
Before, pensioners
were appreciated!

225
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:32,889
They even went to
the seaside for free.

226
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:36,188
I can't remember when
I last saw the sea.

227
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:42,787
What can you do? That's life.
Here, give it to the girl.

228
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:29,481
How do I resemble my dad?

229
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,280
What do you mean?

230
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:40,979
Do I look like him?

231
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,078
No, you look like me.

232
00:33:47,178 --> 00:33:50,877
And what I have from my dad?
-From your dad?

233
00:33:56,277 --> 00:33:57,376
Hair.

234
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:01,976
Really?
-It's the same color.

235
00:34:16,274 --> 00:34:19,573
Who is that Esma who
started working with us? -Dunno.

236
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:24,972
But I don't think she'll stay
long. -Why? -She is clumsy.

237
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:33,871
Why do you ask?
-No particular reason.

238
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,970
What's up, boys? You have
forgotten your war commander?

239
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,869
What's up, Puska?
-Come on. Follow me.

240
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:53,268
Where is this world
going to, Chenga?

241
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:57,468
Young hotties fuck their brains
out. I can't satisfy them all.

242
00:34:58,968 --> 00:35:00,967
Well, it's no wonder with your
looks... -Don't fuck me.

243
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:06,866
How is your mom? -She's fine.
-Don't let me hear that your mom.

244
00:35:07,866 --> 00:35:10,666
lacks something! She has to have
everything she needs.

245
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:14,565
You still work with
that dickhead? -Yeah.

246
00:35:15,265 --> 00:35:20,264
While we fought against Chetniks,
he sold coffee at 150 DEM a kilo.

247
00:35:20,964 --> 00:35:27,363
You forgot that? -If I remembered
everything, I'd kill myself.

248
00:35:28,363 --> 00:35:31,863
Tell me, is this Pelda stupid?
-A bit. -No, tell me, really.

249
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:36,662
He is an expert. He knows
the business. -I say that, too.

250
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:40,262
How come that you two
intellectuals work for an idiot?

251
00:35:40,961 --> 00:35:43,661
Explain it to me, please.
-That's just the way it is.

252
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:47,161
Cenga, I want to help you
settle down. For your sake.

253
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:54,060
I want you to earn some money.
Saran won't dare do anything.

254
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:57,159
When I screwed him in
jail he just kept whistling

255
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:02,758
and looking at me like this.
I fuck him and he just goes...

256
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,657
The proposal is still
on the table.

257
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:17,956
I'll give you ten grand
and you'll get the car.

258
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:23,355
Make it look as if he was killed
by Serbs, Talibans...

259
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:28,755
I don't give a shit.
I just want him gone.

260
00:36:31,254 --> 00:36:34,854
It's OK, Puska.
-What do you mean? -Let's go!

261
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:48,852
Think about it!

262
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:56,650
Fuck it, people loved each
other more during the war.

263
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,050
Stop talking bullshit.

264
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:13,748
You want me to show you
something?

265
00:37:31,145 --> 00:37:34,645
Are you crazy? -Just pass.
I put this ribbon here.

266
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:01,641
Do you ever see dead people?

267
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:05,640
I am not insane! Come on down.

268
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:19,738
The first kiss, long forgotten
The first party not remembered.

269
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:22,338
Come on, shut up!

270
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:26,038
Hug me and hold me tight...
-Don't sing folk songs, please.

271
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:39,936
The first kiss... -Stop it!
-Let's skip classes today!

272
00:38:42,735 --> 00:38:44,235
You are an eager-beaver?

273
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:48,134
No, but my mom will
go berserk, if she fins out.

274
00:38:49,234 --> 00:38:51,834
She won't find out.

275
00:38:56,333 --> 00:39:03,532
It passes, everything passes...
-Will you stop singing?

276
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:12,731
It disappears, everything
disappears. Years go by...

277
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,329
Sabina will be here in an hour.

278
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,929
I don't want her to come.
-Sara!

279
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:30,728
Sabina is stupid!
-Don't speak like that!

280
00:39:31,528 --> 00:39:33,328
She just wants to get married.

281
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:38,727
What is wrong with wanting
to get married?

282
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:43,626
Promise me you will
never get married.

283
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:51,025
Promise.
-Sara, please.

284
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,425
Promise. -Stop it.

285
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:58,524
Promise. -Enough!
No more nonsense!

286
00:39:59,424 --> 00:40:01,124
You will abandon me!

287
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,623
Come here.
Come here!

288
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:22,021
I will never ever
abandon you. Understand?

289
00:40:58,115 --> 00:40:59,915
Sara open the door!
I know you are in there.

290
00:41:02,815 --> 00:41:04,615
You are nerving me.

291
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:10,914
Open, you stupid girl,
I'm freezing.

292
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:45,209
Esma, the boss
wants to see you.

293
00:41:49,408 --> 00:41:50,808
You are my lucky girl!

294
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:57,207
It was an away-win. From now
on you will always buy my bet-tickets.

295
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:02,206
Mister Saran, can I ask you...
I have... a problem... -Yes?

296
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:06,606
Can I have my salary earlier?
Some advance maybe?

297
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:09,205
We'll talk about that tomorrow.

298
00:42:27,303 --> 00:42:28,002
Look!

299
00:42:33,702 --> 00:42:36,601
I can make you the same.
-You will?

300
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:41,600
I could.

301
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,300
Stand up.

302
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:10,096
You said 'some other time.

303
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,895
I really feel sorry about Brazilians.

304
00:43:22,095 --> 00:43:25,494
I can not stand
to see them suffer.

305
00:43:26,594 --> 00:43:32,793
I saw a documentary the other day
about a poor Brazilian.

306
00:43:35,593 --> 00:43:39,692
He had been killed and no one
wanted to come to his funeral.

307
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:43,691
He was left utterly alone.

308
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,290
You're nuts.

309
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:02,989
What do you do for Saran?

310
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:07,088
Different things.

311
00:44:09,788 --> 00:44:13,587
You are like his bodyguard?

312
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:22,486
You know, I studied economics
before the war. -Really? -Yes.

313
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,985
When the war ended I didn't
have the nerve to continue.

314
00:44:29,485 --> 00:44:32,884
I smoke three packs
of cigarettes a day

315
00:44:33,984 --> 00:44:37,284
and I am supposed to listen to
lectures with some kids? No way.

316
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:39,483
I would be embarrassed.

317
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:45,682
What would I do if I graduated
anyway? Where would I find a job?

318
00:44:47,282 --> 00:44:48,982
Well, people find jobs.

319
00:44:51,282 --> 00:44:54,781
I don't know.
I'll be here some time.

320
00:44:56,681 --> 00:44:58,981
Then I'll go join my sister
in Austria. Knittelfeld.

321
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,680
She is trying to get me
the papers.

322
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,375
Can you feel it?

323
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:44,074
The smell.
Just it used to be.

324
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:35,367
Please, I need to sleep.
Do you hear me?

325
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:41,966
What's the matter with you?
I work like a dog whole night.

326
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:45,965
How can you behave like that?
I came home completely exhausted.

327
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:49,365
At least you didn't have to walk.

328
00:46:54,464 --> 00:46:55,164
Go to your room!

329
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:26,159
Come on, eat.

330
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:32,858
When did we get humanitarian
aid? -This is not huma...

331
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:37,458
Yesterday.
We got it yesterday.

332
00:47:38,657 --> 00:47:41,657
How much sugar?
-256 grams.

333
00:47:43,557 --> 00:47:46,356
Per person?! -Yeah.
It's better than nothing.

334
00:47:48,456 --> 00:47:52,655
And butter? -Well,
butter is short these days.

335
00:47:53,255 --> 00:47:55,555
Don't tell me there
is no butter again.

336
00:47:56,555 --> 00:47:57,655
They will send butter.

337
00:47:58,954 --> 00:48:01,154
It's important. They promised
to give some butter.

338
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:05,154
Eat. Come on.

339
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:14,252
Take some bread.

340
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:47,947
Where are you going? -Out.
-Take care, please.

341
00:48:49,147 --> 00:48:49,947
I'll come tomorrow.

342
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:53,946
Don't say that. Only God knows
when something will happen.

343
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:59,146
Stop kissing me! -I won't.
-Find yourself a wife.

344
00:49:00,246 --> 00:49:02,945
Your father had two of you
when he was your age!

345
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:07,045
Get out! You bloody bastard!
-I love you, mom.

346
00:49:20,743 --> 00:49:22,842
You didn't get laid
for a long time?

347
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:28,142
OK! Calm down!

348
00:49:28,741 --> 00:49:30,041
Have you got a barbecue?

349
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:32,341
A what?
-A barbecue!

350
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:37,240
You need it for some business?
-Fuck business.

351
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,139
It figures! That's it?
-What are you talking about?

352
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,639
Forget nature. Fuck her in
a hotel. -Go fuck yourself!

353
00:49:50,938 --> 00:49:52,838
Puska called me.
-Fuck Puska.

354
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:56,237
What he says does not
sound crazy to me.

355
00:49:56,737 --> 00:49:58,637
No, because you are crazy,
you fucking idiot.

356
00:50:00,237 --> 00:50:01,537
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

357
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:42,231
Where did you get it?
-It's from my late dad.

358
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:48,030
Chetniks killed him in Zuc.
They slaughtered him.

359
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:52,129
His friend told me. My dad
did not want to escape

360
00:50:52,529 --> 00:50:54,329
from the trench.
They caught him alive.

361
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:01,428
How did your dad get killed?
-I don't know.

362
00:51:02,828 --> 00:51:06,627
You have to know that!
You know how to shoot?

363
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:11,327
I'll teach you.

364
00:51:14,126 --> 00:51:15,126
Are those real bullets?

365
00:51:16,026 --> 00:51:19,525
Of course! You'll see on
the school trip when I shoot!

366
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:23,125
You'll carry the gun
on the school trip?!

367
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:27,624
Give it to me!

368
00:51:43,522 --> 00:51:44,722
I won't more!
Give me more!

369
00:52:13,418 --> 00:52:15,817
Maybe somebody
should examine Sara?

370
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:20,217
What do you mean 'examine'?
-Not exactly 'examine'.

371
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:23,716
Maybe somebody should talk
to her. -About what?

372
00:52:25,116 --> 00:52:27,016
She didn't act normally
the other night.

373
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:30,915
She threw my bag through
the window and called me names.

374
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,015
She even tried to hit
me with an ashtray.

375
00:52:34,714 --> 00:52:35,814
She is still a child.
She plays her little games.

376
00:52:36,714 --> 00:52:38,714
Come on, she is not just a child.
She doesn't act normally.

377
00:52:40,714 --> 00:52:42,713
She is a bit touched
in the head.

378
00:52:43,113 --> 00:52:45,613
Maybe she needs some
professional help.

379
00:52:48,113 --> 00:52:51,612
What do you know about children?!
You don't know anything!

380
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:54,012
Nor will you ever know!

381
00:55:48,286 --> 00:55:52,586
Bosnia is my bloodied soil,
The land of ancestors,

382
00:55:54,186 --> 00:55:57,785
Bosnia is love,
and a flower in my hair...

383
00:56:00,985 --> 00:56:02,984
And the land of my dreams.

384
00:56:03,884 --> 00:56:04,784
What a stupid poem.

385
00:56:05,784 --> 00:56:07,384
Why don't you write
a better one?

386
00:56:09,383 --> 00:56:11,183
Whoever meddles
with Bosnia...

387
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,782
What happened with
you and Sabina?

388
00:56:17,782 --> 00:56:19,182
Nothing.
Why do you ask?

389
00:56:20,282 --> 00:56:22,181
She complained about you.

390
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:27,081
I didn't do anything to her.
I really didn't.

391
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,180
I didn't want to eat and
she started insulting me.

392
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:38,979
She said you didn't raise me
properly, she kept yelling at me.

393
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,879
I threw her purse
throw the window.

394
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:44,378
Sara, you shouldn't
have done that!

395
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:47,878
And she can do
whatever she wants.

396
00:56:48,878 --> 00:56:50,777
You are grounded
for the next 5 days.

397
00:56:51,677 --> 00:56:54,177
Mom, please don't.
It's Ena's birthday tomorrow.

398
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:57,476
Don't argue with me.
-Mom, please.

399
00:56:58,176 --> 00:57:00,776
Sara, come on...
-Mom.

400
00:57:02,576 --> 00:57:03,475
Yes?

401
00:57:05,575 --> 00:57:10,774
I am. Hi. I can't now...

402
00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:22,173
Call me later.
Right. Bye.

403
00:57:28,272 --> 00:57:29,872
Who was that?

404
00:57:31,671 --> 00:57:32,871
Sabina.

405
00:57:35,571 --> 00:57:42,570
Listen, I decided that you
should stay alone tonight.

406
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,269
What do you say about that?
-What?

407
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:51,668
I want to see if you can
take care of yourself.

408
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,868
Alone?
Without Sabina around?

409
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:57,868
Absolutely alone!

410
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:05,566
Really?
-Yes.

411
00:58:43,661 --> 00:58:45,861
You don't mind me...
-No.

412
00:58:59,959 --> 00:59:01,358
You are some nice girl.

413
00:59:03,058 --> 00:59:06,358
We used to inhale glue
in our student days.

414
00:59:07,757 --> 00:59:13,257
Students of medicine. Once,
we were standing in front of the

415
00:59:13,757 --> 00:59:16,856
classroom and the professor
appeared from somewhere,

416
00:59:17,256 --> 00:59:19,656
but I did not notice him.
my eyelashes were

417
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:22,955
closed with glue. The professor.
asked me something and

418
00:59:23,455 --> 00:59:25,655
I was just twinkling like this.

419
00:59:26,455 --> 00:59:27,955
God knows what crossed
his mind at this moment.

420
00:59:29,654 --> 00:59:32,654
I said you're nuts.

421
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:54,051
What?

422
01:00:12,648 --> 01:00:14,648
You're really nuts.

423
01:00:22,047 --> 01:00:25,746
Hey, let's eat.
-OK.

424
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,239
Mom, have you
found the certificate?

425
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:16,839
I have to go to the
municipality office to get it

426
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:23,338
and then stamp it in the court.
You will go on your school trip.

427
01:03:56,816 --> 01:04:00,715
You know what I really
would like? To have my people

428
01:04:01,615 --> 01:04:05,614
and my own company. They would
work for me, I would deal with

429
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:10,514
interest rates, buy Mercedes C
class with darkened windows,

430
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:15,413
wide tires. I would have
my own bodyguards.

431
01:04:16,413 --> 01:04:18,312
So you don't get beaten
up again.

432
01:04:19,412 --> 01:04:21,412
I was looking for him today.
With the gun.

433
01:04:22,012 --> 01:04:25,511
When I get hold of him,
I will stick it in his ass.

434
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:30,111
You have it here?

435
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:35,110
Yes, why? -Give it to me.

436
01:04:50,008 --> 01:04:52,108
It will stay with me till
you calm down.

437
01:04:54,007 --> 01:04:55,807
Give me the gun! -No!

438
01:04:58,207 --> 01:05:01,606
Give it back! -If you think
that I am your friend you

439
01:05:02,406 --> 01:05:10,205
will leave it here. -Ok,
but take good care of it.

440
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,502
Excuse me, Mr. Saran.

441
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,501
Here is my lucky girl. Come in!

442
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:41,700
Remember when I asked you,
If I can get some advance payment?

443
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,200
Come in! -It'll be on Tuesday,
I guarantee. -Cut the crap!

444
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:57,198
How much? -Two hundred.
-Of what? -Euros.

445
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:07,997
Thank you.

446
01:06:09,296 --> 01:06:10,896
Screw you guys and him too!

447
01:06:12,096 --> 01:06:14,496
Give me the bet-ticket.

448
01:06:15,295 --> 01:06:17,195
Third Tuesday.
Fucking Tuesday.

449
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:19,895
Give me the bet-ticket.

450
01:06:27,994 --> 01:06:28,094
I'm sorry.

451
01:06:33,193 --> 01:06:36,392
I could have won 300 marks.
You fucking clumsy bitch!

452
01:06:37,992 --> 01:06:39,492
Come on, fuck 300 marks.

453
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:42,791
Yeah, fuck 300 marks.

454
01:06:44,491 --> 01:06:48,191
So, why didn't you pay
for the bet-ticket?

455
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:50,190
Hey, let her go!

456
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,989
Hey, stop it!
Let him go!

457
01:07:01,189 --> 01:07:02,489
What's your problem?
Are you crazy!

458
01:07:03,788 --> 01:07:06,388
He'll kill us unless we kill him.
-Why didn't you let me kill him?

459
01:07:06,888 --> 01:07:08,588
Get in the car!

460
01:07:16,287 --> 01:07:17,986
You are all animals!

461
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:11,270
I told you everything
was going to be OK.

462
01:09:22,868 --> 01:09:24,768
Crypussy!

463
01:09:26,868 --> 01:09:28,367
You look like shit.

464
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:34,167
Cry more,
you'll piss less.

465
01:09:36,866 --> 01:09:37,966
Your mom is here!

466
01:09:43,565 --> 01:09:44,565
Have you brought it?
-It's all paid for.

467
01:09:45,165 --> 01:09:48,265
With certificate?
-No, I got my salery.

468
01:09:48,964 --> 01:09:50,464
You'll go to the school-trip.

469
01:09:51,164 --> 01:09:53,264
And certificate?
-We don't need it.

470
01:09:53,664 --> 01:09:56,163
Good afternoon.
I'm teacher Muharem.

471
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,563
It's good to see
that you feel better.

472
01:09:58,663 --> 01:10:02,662
Sara told me about...
What can I say? Fight for it.

473
01:10:03,562 --> 01:10:05,862
I know a woman who cured
it with herbal teas.

474
01:10:10,361 --> 01:10:11,961
Where is the certificate?
-What illness?

475
01:10:13,061 --> 01:10:17,660
Where is the certificate?
-You brat!

476
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:23,260
Mom, give me the certificate!
Give it to me! Mom!

477
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:28,250
How come that you shaheed's child
still have to pay the school-trip?

478
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:31,850
She lies, she is not on the list!

479
01:11:35,849 --> 01:11:38,849
You stupid cow, come here!

480
01:11:40,748 --> 01:11:44,148
My father is shaheed!
Cetniks slaughtered him in Zuc.

481
01:11:44,848 --> 01:11:47,547
He did not want to leave
the trench. Memorize this!

482
01:12:07,344 --> 01:12:08,144
Esma. -What?

483
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:11,644
I am leaving.
I got the papers.

484
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,141
Who will identify your
father if you leave?

485
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:35,940
He will be alone on
those plastic sheets.

486
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,440
Who will identify the body?

487
01:13:38,531 --> 01:13:40,231
How come you are not at school?

488
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:43,630
How come you did not
bring the certificate?

489
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:47,130
Fuck off!

490
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,929
I am the only one
that is not on the list.

491
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:57,628
Where is the certificate?

492
01:14:06,127 --> 01:14:09,327
Shut up, or I will show you
as never before.

493
01:14:10,427 --> 01:14:14,826
Do you know who my father is?
-How dare you?

494
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:18,425
You don't know! You don't
even know who fucked you.

495
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:02,019
Where did he die?
-Sara, give me the gun.

496
01:15:02,519 --> 01:15:05,319
Where did he die?
-Give me the gun.

497
01:15:06,118 --> 01:15:10,118
Tell me, where did he die?
-On the line. -What line?

498
01:15:11,918 --> 01:15:15,017
First. -Where is that line?
-Sara, please!

499
01:15:16,717 --> 01:15:20,016
You don't know! You are
lying to me my whole life!

500
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:24,816
I want to know the truth!
Tell me the truth!

501
01:15:28,515 --> 01:15:31,515
You want the truth!?!
You want the truth!?!

502
01:15:34,514 --> 01:15:35,414
They raped me!

503
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:38,614
They raped me in the war-camp!

504
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:40,613
You were born in that camp!

505
01:15:41,713 --> 01:15:46,113
You are Chetnik's bastard!
Chetnik's bastard!

506
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:07,610
I am not!
My father is a shaheed!

507
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:41,205
When flowers are in full bloom
When the whole world is perfumed

508
01:16:49,903 --> 01:16:58,902
The soul cries in desire
We parted a long time ago

509
01:17:08,801 --> 01:17:18,399
These red roses
Are crimsoned with blood

510
01:17:26,498 --> 01:17:35,097
Blood and tears remain
For the killed heart

511
01:17:44,695 --> 01:17:56,394
The sky above us
Is nothing but a shadow of curtain

512
01:18:04,093 --> 01:18:15,091
Seven floors of heaven
tear our chest apart

513
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:32,889
Spring is in us
When soaked with tears

514
01:18:39,588 --> 01:18:50,186
Even the desert blossoms
And turns to paradise

515
01:20:45,769 --> 01:20:47,869
I wanted to kill her.

516
01:20:51,468 --> 01:20:55,368
I hit as hard as I could

517
01:21:04,966 --> 01:21:09,066
but nothing happened.

518
01:21:10,766 --> 01:21:13,865
My belly grew bigger.
With her inside.

519
01:21:20,064 --> 01:21:25,663
They were coming even then.
Every day.

520
01:21:26,363 --> 01:21:28,963
Two or three of them.
Every day.

521
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:38,762
In the hospital,
when I gave birth,

522
01:21:42,261 --> 01:21:47,460
I told them not to
bring her to me.

523
01:21:54,059 --> 01:21:57,959
She was crying.

524
01:22:00,258 --> 01:22:02,058
I heard her through the walls.

525
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:10,657
Next day, milk started
to flow from my breasts.

526
01:22:13,656 --> 01:22:22,755
I said that I would feed
her just once. Just once.

527
01:22:25,155 --> 01:22:34,054
When they brought her to me,
when I held her in my arms,

528
01:22:40,153 --> 01:22:42,052
she was so tiny.

529
01:22:51,551 --> 01:22:53,251
She was so beautiful.

530
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:03,549
I had forgotten that there was
anything beautiful in this world.

531
01:25:44,895 --> 01:25:49,175
<i>We grew up together,
my city nand I.</i>

532
01:25:49,369 --> 01:25:53,677
<i>The same blue sky
dedicated a verse to us.</i>

533
01:25:53,868 --> 01:25:57,840
<i>Below Trebevic we dreamed
our dreams.</i>

534
01:25:58,072 --> 01:26:02,396
<i>Who will grow
faster, grow prettier.</i>

535
01:26:02,692 --> 01:26:06,702
<i>You were big when I was born.</i>

536
01:26:06,878 --> 01:26:10,838
<i>Smiling from Igman
you sent me sleep.</i>

537
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:15,149
<i>The boy who grows up fell
in love with you,</i>

538
01:26:15,344 --> 01:26:19,324
<i>and stayed here,
together with his city.</i>

539
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:23,780
<i>Where ever I go I only
dream of you,</i>

540
01:26:23,948 --> 01:26:28,255
<i>all my roads
are leading back to you,</i>

541
01:26:28,457 --> 01:26:32,270
<i>I longingly wait to see
your lights</i>

542
01:26:32,405 --> 01:26:36,479
<i>Sarajevo my love.</i>

543
01:26:36,779 --> 01:26:40,812
<i>You have your songs,
and I sing them</i>

544
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,837
<i>want to share my dreams
with you.</i>

545
01:26:45,477 --> 01:26:49,503
<i>My joys and your happiness,</i>

546
01:26:49,711 --> 01:26:53,414
<i>Sarajevo my love.</i>

547
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:58,600
