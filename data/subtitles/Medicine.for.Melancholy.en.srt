1
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,209
- Oh, hey.

2
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,648
Where you guys going?

3
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,517
- We're just gonna head out, man.

4
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,543
- I got some cereal

5
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,988
if you guys want to stay.

6
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,013
- I think we're good,

7
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,007
but thanks,
man.

8
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,081
Thanks.

9
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,116
Thanks for the party.

10
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,130
- All right.

11
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,802
- Sorry.

12
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:39,307
I'd say something, but, you know,
I'm just kind of hungover.

13
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,624
- Medicine cabinet.

14
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,958
- Appreciate that.

15
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,096
Coffee?

16
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,092
I know a place.

17
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,195
It's not too far from here.

18
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,675
It's a bit of a walk,
but it's really good.

19
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,838
Cool,
it's just over the hill in Noe.

20
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,683
Seriously, not too far.

21
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,229
So-so what do you do?

22
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,365
Like, what do you do?

23
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,210
What's your occupation?

24
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,112
- Where do I work,
or what do I do?

25
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,446
- Both.

26
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,714
- Americano.

27
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,448
Double macchiato.

28
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,319
Food will be out in just a minute, okay?

29
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,349
- Appreciate that.

30
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,996
- I don't have a job.

31
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,002
- How do you pay rent?

32
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,295
- Who says I pay rent?

33
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,232
- Nobody.

34
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,368
Nobody said you pay rent.

35
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,608
I was just-
I was just asking questions.

36
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,636
You don't have a job.

37
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,671
That's cool.

38
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,975
- I'm figuring it out.

39
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,149
- Figuring it out.

40
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,834
You're not gonna ask me?

41
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,769
- Ask what?

42
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:45,828
- What I do.

43
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,331
- No.

44
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,006
- This is a little embarrassing,

45
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,951
but I kind of forgot your name.

46
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,921
- I don't know if we ever got there.

47
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,283
- Yeah.

48
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,054
I know we didn't.

49
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,391
We were pretty drunk.

50
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,657
I'm Micah.

51
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,859
- Angela.

52
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:19,463
- Nice to meet you, Angela.

53
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,338
- And here you go.

54
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,570
Eggs over easy on wheat

55
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,637
and one Belgian waffle for the lady.

56
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,376
Do you guys need anything else?

57
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,474
- I think we're good, man.

58
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,509
Appreciate it.

59
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,201
So which way are you headed?

60
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,902
- Why?

61
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,240
- We can share a cab.

62
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,970
Marina?

63
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,505
Cow Hollow?

64
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:12,718
I'm just saying 'cause, you know,
I'm also headed that way.

65
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,591
So we could-

66
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,255
You know what?

67
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,456
I'll get us a cab.

68
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,433
Unless you want to race cabs
or something.

69
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,342
- Excuse me.

70
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,015
Left, right here?

71
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,047
- To the right.

72
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,115
- To the right.

73
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,217
- At the curb.

74
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,956
- Okay.

75
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,758
It's $12.50, please.

76
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,600
- Oh, I got it.
I got it.

77
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,036
It's cool.

78
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,061
Wait, Angela.

79
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,664
Angela, Angela.

80
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,199
Keep it running.

81
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,279
Angela.

82
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,382
- Sir, sir?

83
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,617
Meter's still running.

84
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,125
- I know, man.

85
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,826
- How far you have to go?

86
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,528
- Tenderloin.

87
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,127
- I thought you lived here.

88
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,695
- Man, just drive.

89
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,297
- Okay.

90
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:23,748
# #

91
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,953
- # Woke up with fingers crossed #

92
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:32,863
# In a boy's bed with your pants off #

93
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:38,200
# After polite declines
of coffee and toast #

94
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:43,607
# Walked home itching
in last night's clothes #

95
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:48,979
# Past the Phone Booth
and Beauty Bar #

96
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:54,214
# The broken windows
of your neighbor's cars #

97
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:59,816
# Through the back door
to a message from sis #

98
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:04,125
# Asking,
"Who was your New Year's Kiss?" #

99
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:15,836
# #

100
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,274
- Okay, sir.

101
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,401
- How much?

102
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,379
- It's $24.50, sir.

103
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,450
- Shit.

104
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,884
I don't have that much.

105
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,253
- That's her purse on the floor.

106
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,314
- What?

107
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,792
- That's her purse on the floor.

108
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,319
- Man, that's not a purse.

109
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,389
It's a wallet.

110
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,128
- Whatever.

111
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,259
- Think you slick.

112
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:46,048
# #

113
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,249
Uh, yeah, I'm looking for an address.

114
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,842
Joanne Hardwicke.

115
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,945
Yes, Hardwicke.

116
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,786
No, no, not the J. Hardwicke
in San Mateo.

117
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,382
It's Joanne Hardwicke.

118
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:29,994
Hardwicke is spelled
H-A-R-D-W-I-C-K-E.

119
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,696
Yes, ma'am, with an E at the end.

120
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,002
Yeah.

121
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,167
Cornelius Street in Oakland?

122
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,076
No, I got that one already.

123
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,137
Thanks.

124
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:55,284
# #

125
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,647
- What are you doing here?

126
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,147
- Yeah, that address on your license:
it's wrong.

127
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,210
- Uh-

128
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,417
Thank you.

129
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,394
- Can I come in?

130
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,147
- Oh.

131
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,920
Mm-hmm.

132
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,168
Uh, do you want something to drink?

133
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,044
- Uh, yeah.

134
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,912
Uh, water is cool.

135
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,941
- All right.

136
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,221
Hey.

137
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,256
- Oh.

138
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,270
Appreciate that.

139
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,652
So you don't pay rent here?

140
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,854
Who does pay rent here?

141
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,328
- No one.

142
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,463
- Okay, who pays the mortgage here?

143
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,798
- My boyfriend.

144
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,828
- Your boyfriend.

145
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,863
- My boyfriend.

146
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,898
- And where is he?

147
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,643
- London.

148
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,446
- London.

149
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,110
- Yes, London.

150
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,779
Would you stop repeating me?

151
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,219
- Oh, all right.

152
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,779
What's he do?

153
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,691
- He's a curator.

154
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,627
- A curator.

155
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,527
Sorry, sorry.

156
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,931
It just seems weird that as a curator,

157
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,095
he doesn't really have
any art on the walls.

158
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,900
Like, none.

159
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,337
I mean, it just seems like

160
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:05,241
they probably got, like, an extra painting
or a sculpture lying around

161
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,371
that he could have brought home.

162
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,007
Sorry, sorry.

163
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,038
Is he white?

164
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,147
- Does it matter?

165
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,849
- Yes and no.

166
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,886
- What if I told you he is white,

167
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:24,157
and we met in a volunteer program
in Bayview?

168
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,754
Would that matter?

169
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:27,988
- Yes and no.

170
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,022
- Oh, okay.

171
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,056
I see.

172
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,535
You're one of those people.

173
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,628
- "Those people"?

174
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,298
- Yes, those people

175
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,206
that think that Black History Month
is in February

176
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,642
because it's the shortest month
in the year.

177
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,543
- It is.

178
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,605
- Black History Month is in February

179
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,016
because Carter G. Woodson
wanted Negro History Week

180
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:51,455
to coincide with the births
of Frederick Douglass and Lincoln,

181
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,391
both in the same week in February.

182
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:57,918
Okay, well,

183
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:02,195
thank you for returning my wallet,
but you have to go.

184
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,135
- Well, we're just getting started.

185
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,297
- You need to leave.

186
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,738
- What did I say?

187
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:09,763
- Nothing.

188
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:10,968
I need to take a shower.

189
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,135
- A shower?

190
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,166
- Yes,

191
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,579
which you should have done
before you got here.

192
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,480
- How do-how do you know?

193
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,541
- Did you?

194
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,085
Okay, well,

195
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,611
all right.

196
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,851
- Wait, hold on.

197
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,052
Hold, hold.

198
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,052
- Excuse me?

199
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,726
What are you doing?

200
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:53,680
- # A beautiful day for a neighbor. #

201
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,711
# Would you be mine? #

202
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,849
# Could you be mine? #

203
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:04,658
# Won't you be my neighbor? #

204
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,427
# Won't you please? #

205
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,494
# Won't you please? #

206
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:17,600
# Won't you be my neighbor? #

207
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,135
Hey, there,
one-night stand neighbor.

208
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,238
Want to go to
the Land of Make Believe

209
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,909
with me and King Friday

210
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,182
and all the magical critters
and creatures?

211
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,753
- I'm going to take shower.

212
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,525
So weird.

213
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,118
Coffee?

214
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,428
- Oh, thank you.

215
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,526
- There's milk and sugar
in the kitchen.

216
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,561
- Oh, appreciate it.

217
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,276
Can we try this again?

218
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,513
I'm Micah.

219
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,279
- Joanne.

220
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,313
- I know.

221
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,157
Miss Hardwicke, with an E.

222
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,092
Can I call you Jo?

223
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:56,928
Cool.

224
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,233
- Can I call you Mike?

225
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,261
- No.

226
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,831
It's not the same.

227
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,396
- Hey, love.

228
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,592
Hmm.

229
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:33,297
Just having a cup of coffee.

230
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,272
Yeah, I went.

231
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,037
I was bored.

232
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,669
Mmm,

233
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:47,674
down on Market?

234
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,711
Within an hour.

235
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,523
Uh, I'm not gonna ride my bike.

236
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,721
I'm gonna take a cab.

237
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:09,071
Uh, okay, I'm gonna ride my bike.

238
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,940
Are you happy now?

239
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,312
You're never happy.

240
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,075
Okay.

241
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,243
I love you.

242
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,274
Bye.

243
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,253
- I figured the walls needed
a little artwork,

244
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,820
like the lights and darks
and the crosshatching and stuff.

245
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,127
Very artistic.

246
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,569
- I have an errand to run.

247
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,698
- You want some company?

248
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,935
- Sure.

249
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,237
- Cool.

250
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,767
- I'm gonna go get dressed.

251
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:09,457
# #

252
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,367
Right over here.

253
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,674
- Oh.

254
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,422
- Hey, can you lock my bike up for me?

255
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,449
- Yeah, sure.

256
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,492
Hey, wait.

257
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:19,833
- Will you wait?

258
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:20,860
- Why?

259
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,372
- You have to wait right here.

260
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,034
- Why?

261
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,702
- Just think about it.

262
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,304
- Hey.

263
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,342
You forgot your wallet.

264
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,297
- Hi, can I help you?

265
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,330
- Yes.

266
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,969
I'm here to see Sierra Ornielias.

267
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,103
- Okay, is she expecting you?

268
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,636
- Concerning the Santos piece.

269
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,841
- Okay, and what was your name?

270
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,544
- Joanne Hardwicke.

271
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,020
- Thanks.

272
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,285
So are you working on the Santos piece?

273
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,551
- Um, no.

274
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,615
My boyfriend is.

275
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,651
- Oh, okay.

276
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,054
- Hi.

277
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,090
- Joanne.

278
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,519
- Hello.

279
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,224
Yeah, it's all done.

280
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:57,724
Um, she was very nice, very sweet.

281
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,329
Okay.

282
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:08,676
E, 15, 6, 6, 5.

283
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,705
It's the same sequence.

284
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:19,180
I'm gonna go for a walk or something,
or just-something.

285
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:24,427
Yeah.

286
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:29,832
Um, the weather's nice.

287
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:33,634
The weather's nice.

288
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,400
Yeah, I will.

289
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,465
Okay.

290
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,876
No, no, not at all.

291
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:46,214
I'm just-
I'm just a little hungover.

292
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,309
Okay.

293
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,325
Okay.

294
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,624
I love you too.

295
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,653
Bye.

296
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,513
Excuse me, sir.

297
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,642
What's up?

298
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,050
- What now?

299
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,917
- Let's go to MoMA.

300
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,752
- I don't want to go to MoMA.

301
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,257
- What's wrong with MoMA?

302
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:31,194
- No comment.

303
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,697
- Okay, black man.

304
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:38,134
So what do two black folks do
on a Sunday afternoon?

305
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:43,539
- Go to church, eat fried chicken.

306
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,373
What do two black folks not do
on a Sunday afternoon?

307
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,469
- What?

308
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,844
- Go to a museum.

309
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:50,870
- That is not funny.

310
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,177
- It is funny.

311
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,411
- It's not funny.

312
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,011
- It's funny 'cause it's not funny.

313
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,731
Sylvia Striplin.

314
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,198
- What?

315
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,223
- Sylvia Striplin.

316
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,257
It's a game.

317
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:14,169
Name a song that she
had sampled and by who.

318
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,638
Come on, Sylvia Striplin.

319
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,301
- I don't listen to music like that.

320
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:21,710
- All right, Sylvia Striplin,
<i>You Can't Turn Me Away</i>

321
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,543
or Lil Kim's <i>Get Money.</i>

322
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,570
- How's it go?

323
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:31,479
# You can't turn me away. #

324
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,251
- Okay, I think I remember.

325
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,316
It's basically the same song, right?

326
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,759
- Yeah, yeah.

327
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:40,286
You might have a push on that one.

328
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,804
- Why does yours sound like
a farting trumpet?

329
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:52,936
MoAD, Mama.

330
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,343
Not MoMA.

331
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,087
- Hey, good afternoon.
Welcome to MoAD.

332
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,113
- Thank you.

333
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,147
- How you doing today?

334
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,181
I'm all right, yeah.

335
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,785
Can I get two tickets?

336
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:14,821
- That'll be $10.

337
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:47,475
# #

338
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:18,073
- The first objects which saluted my eyes
when I arrived on the coast

339
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:22,780
were the sea and the slave ship

340
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:28,952
as well as the multitude of black people
of every description

341
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,961
chained together,

342
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:39,835
every one of their countenances
expressing dejection and sorrow.

343
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:45,571
No, I no longer doubted my fate.

344
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,172
But I was not long suffered
to indulge my grief,

345
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:56,175
for I was soon put down
under the decks.

346
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:05,094
There I received such a salutation
as I had never experienced in my life.

347
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,011
- Wait.

348
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,218
We should walk somewhere.

349
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,249
- Okay.

350
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,694
- Have you been there before?

351
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,099
- The opening and a few times after that.

352
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,130
- I didn't even know it was there.

353
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:47,081
# #

354
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:13,011
- It looks like LA.

355
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,984
- I've never been.

356
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,920
- Yeah, like the view from the hills.

357
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:21,288
It's like the hills in LA.

358
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,324
- This is a one-night stand.

359
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,857
- It's only been one night.

360
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,266
Can't do nothing about that.

361
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,176
I mean, it is what it is.

362
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:51,212
# #

363
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,670
Watch out for the plant there.

364
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,736
You got it?

365
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,838
- Yes.

366
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,008
- Cool, cool.

367
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,848
You can put your bike right here.

368
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,877
Watch out for the aquarium.

369
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,283
- That's cute.

370
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:21,423
Whose bike is that?

371
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:24,025
- It's my ex's.

372
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,660
- Oh.

373
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,900
- I took it back.

374
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:32,571
Do you want something to drink
or something?

375
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,634
- No, I'm fine.

376
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,269
- Some water?

377
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:39,112
- Fine.

378
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,254
What are you doing?

379
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,781
- I got to pee.

380
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,655
- Okay, well, pee then.

381
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,686
- Cool.

382
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,858
You familiar with that?

383
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,960
- Um, kind of.

384
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,402
I'm a transplant.

385
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,269
- Born and raised.

386
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,796
My folks lived out there.

387
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:11,865
Imagine the Lower Haight,

388
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:15,936
nothing but black folks
and white artists.

389
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:16,968
- Hmm.

390
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,546
But why would you put it on your wall?

391
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,108
I know you're not supposed to forget,

392
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:25,053
but it's not like you'd forget
without seeing it every day.

393
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,078
- Oh, no, no.

394
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,647
It's not like that.

395
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:30,592
You know, people just walk around
this city like everything is so perfect,

396
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,219
and it's all good and everything.

397
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:33,251
And I don't know.

398
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,787
This just reminds me,

399
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,322
you know, poor folks still got it hard.

400
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:40,496
Like, you look at Mission Bay,
and this poster's still relevant.

401
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,934
Oh, I'm just saying.

402
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,807
You want some tea or something?

403
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:51,837
Cool.

404
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:52,871
I washed my hands.

405
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,905
I promise.

406
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:54,940
You can check.

407
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,976
- Stop.

408
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,196
Do you even like it here?

409
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:15,034
- What?

410
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,166
- It seems like this city
just pisses you off.

411
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,233
- No, I love this city.

412
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:25,544
I hate this city,
but I love this city.

413
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,348
I mean, the hills, the fog.

414
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:33,015
Any man who can find a street corner
has got himself a view.

415
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:37,686
San Francisco is beautiful,
and it's got nothing to do with privilege.

416
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,630
It's got nothing to do with beatniks
or hippies or yuppies.

417
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,132
It just is.

418
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:47,160
You shouldn't have to be
upper-middle class to be a part of that.

419
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,417
Hey.

420
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,757
- Hey.

421
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:13,194
- Were you sleeping?

422
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,424
- Maybe.

423
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,737
What are you doing?

424
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,569
- Getting in my bed.

425
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:24,699
- No, you're not.

426
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:26,470
- Yes, I am.

427
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,343
- No, you haven't showered.

428
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:30,846
- So?
It's my bed.

429
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,873
- Not while I'm in it.

430
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,214
- You don't pay rent here.

431
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:39,484
- All day today, last night, no shower.

432
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,081
That's disgusting.

433
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,489
- I've been with you all day.

434
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,584
You know where I've been.

435
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:47,063
- Exactly.

436
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,086
- For real?

437
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,120
- Yes.

438
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,372
- Fine.

439
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,408
I'm not using soap.

440
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,883
And I might not dry off either.

441
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,149
I'm all clean.

442
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,716
Are you happy now?

443
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,162
I can get in my own bed?

444
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:23,884
- So what do you do?

445
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:32,091
- I'm the number two aquarium guy
in the whole Bay Area.

446
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,290
- Number two what?

447
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,457
- Aquarium installer.

448
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,933
You know, fish tanks and stuff like that.

449
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:38,957
But more than that.

450
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:43,462
Like, there's a guy,
he's the number one guy.

451
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:49,207
And he does all kind
of high-end corporate shit.

452
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:52,841
But then after that,
I'm point man on everything else.

453
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:57,911
It's mostly doctor's offices,
stuff like that.

454
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:00,821
- What's it like?

455
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,451
- Well, I got a little setup
over on Fulton.

456
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,755
I send my tanks there.

457
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:05,784
I go get the right rock.

458
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,763
And then I go over
to San Leandro

459
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,732
where there's a warehouse
where I get all my fish.

460
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,462
I get 'em straight from Fiji,
Indonesia.

461
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,936
It's cool.

462
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:18,429
But you can go to a store,
and you might be looking for an angelfish.

463
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,000
They might have one angelfish
in that whole store.

464
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,512
You're married to that angelfish.

465
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:27,745
But the warehouse,
they got all kinds of angels.

466
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,746
For a lot of people,
getting an aquarium is like set dressing.

467
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,257
Like, they know
the type of fish they want.

468
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,125
You know, they got the tank
already set in place.

469
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:42,120
But for other folks,
it's like curating.

470
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:45,191
They don't know what they want.

471
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,295
They just want it to be beautiful.

472
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:52,069
That's my job, to make it beautiful.

473
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,645
- How'd you get into it?

474
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,207
- When I was a kid,
we had a tank in our house,

475
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,481
and you could hear it
through the whole place.

476
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,890
I used to leave my door open
and just fall asleep to the sound of it.

477
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,230
- That's sweet.

478
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,231
- Thanks.

479
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,304
Where you going?

480
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,300
- I make T-shirts.

481
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,326
- What?

482
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:59,433
- It's kind of what I do.

483
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:00,943
Like this one.

484
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,835
- Okay.

485
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,914
- Did you wonder
what this name meant?

486
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,953
- I just thought it was a name
of some Ikea furniture.

487
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,324
Like a Loden sofa.

488
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,695
- It's the name of a filmmaker.

489
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:23,961
I screen-print them,
different women directors.

490
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,935
I do it at a friend's studio.

491
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,131
- You make money off that?

492
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:30,639
- It's not about that.

493
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,343
I'm gonna play you a song.

494
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,369
- All right.

495
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:39,712
What you gonna play?

496
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,114
- Okay.

497
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,757
I can't play with you looking at me.

498
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,225
- Okay.

499
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,297
Uh, I'll turn around.

500
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,900
There.

501
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,378
I'm not looking at you.

502
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:14,076
- I'm gonna turn around too.

503
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,514
- I'll cover my eyes anyway,

504
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:25,051
just to show you
that I'm a trustworthy guy.

505
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:43,903
# #

506
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:37,757
# #

507
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:53,773
# #

508
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,817
- # You are a sun #

509
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,849
# You are a sea #

510
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:17,833
# You are the ones that I see #

511
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:22,641
# You're the one I dream of #

512
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:27,082
# Giving me no zero #

513
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:33,716
# You're the one I dream of #

514
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:37,955
# I dream of #

515
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:10,355
- Hey.

516
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,352
- It's okay?

517
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:16,388
- Yeah.

518
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:28,603
- I'm hungry.

519
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:30,670
- Say what?

520
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,604
- Hey.

521
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,213
Hey.

522
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:39,653
- Yeah?

523
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:41,281
- We need to eat.

524
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:07,781
And we need an onion.

525
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,377
- Onion?

526
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,048
Your breath is gonna be kicking
after that.

527
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:14,750
I'm just-
no, you can get an onion.

528
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:18,283
I'm just saying, you know,
don't try to tell me any secrets.

529
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:24,427
Oh, and check it out.
Check it out.

530
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,230
How do you do today?

531
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,170
Me and the boy
have to talk about things,

532
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:34,507
because he doesn't understand
responsibility.

533
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,739
I do impressions.

534
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,838
Every black guy
has a Bill Cosby impression.

535
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,042
- I think so.

536
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,072
- Yeah.

537
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:44,018
I won a Cosby-tition in Oakland.

538
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:48,615
It was part chili cook-off,
part Bill Cosby competition.

539
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:51,456
I took first place for my Cosby,

540
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:55,726
second place
for the chili cook-off, though.

541
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:58,165
We good?

542
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,170
Cool.

543
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,850
- And we were like,
"What are you talking about?"

544
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,292
And they were like,
"Property values and blah, blah, blah."

545
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,317
I was like, "What?

546
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,387
Property values mean more
than human lives?"

547
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:31,400
And I think-unfortunately,
I think that's what happened to the Castro.

548
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:35,427
As the upscale people moved in,
the attitudes became, you know,

549
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:37,871
more of the attitudes of the upper class.

550
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:41,434
There is this sense in this town
that we are becoming a city

551
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:42,876
of the very rich and the very poor.

552
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,404
We all know people have been
pushed out at an alarming rate.

553
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,508
I mean, I would say thousands
and thousands of people

554
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:50,109
have been pushed out
in the last 12 years

555
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:53,554
from mainly the eastern side of the city
where all the renters are.

556
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,650
- The mayor,
in this last election campaign,

557
00:59:56,693 --> 01:00:02,154
and all the people opposing him
never used the words "rent control" at all.

558
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,666
There were nine or ten other people
opposing the mayor.

559
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,191
None of them mentioned it

560
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:07,930
in the description
of what they believed in

561
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,199
and what they're interested in.

562
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,502
And the mayor, who's been in office
for how many years now,

563
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,338
has never used the words "rent control."

564
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,003
So they are trying to make this

565
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,069
into something that
no one can put their fingers on.

566
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,239
It's just gonna happen.

567
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,647
- They're already building
market-rate condos in Bayview,

568
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,914
and you know that they're not gonna have
market-rate condos next to projects.

569
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:24,977
You know what's gonna go,

570
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,818
and it ain't gonna be
the market-rate condos.

571
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:27,914
We're already seeing that.

572
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,891
Bayview is gonna go the way
that Fillmore did,

573
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,791
and they're gonna gentrify
the neighborhood

574
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,659
and push out the people
who are living there now

575
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:34,993
and bring in more upscale people.

576
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,056
- Well, when the Fillmore
and the Western Addition

577
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,036
and all that gentrification happened,
we're still feeling those effects.

578
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,197
And then anyone who's gone
through the dot-com boom

579
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,936
knows that, you know,
it looks good now in comparison,

580
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,809
because then people
literally were renting out closets,

581
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,111
literally renting out closets
for, like, $600 to $800.

582
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,138
- They still are.

583
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:57,675
- Is there any, like,
options for people that make-

584
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,689
I mean, there's no affordable housing
for actual poor people?

585
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,658
- Move to the East Bay,
which is what people are doing.

586
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,627
- I like in Berkley and Oakland,

587
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,359
and that has been the tale
of the last ten years.

588
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:10,423
And unfortunately,

589
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:12,866
a lot of us from the East Bay
are getting pushed out

590
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:15,200
by people who have been
pushed out of San Francisco.

591
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:18,071
- There's a ballot initiative
that supposedly is about

592
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,369
eminent domain issues

593
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:22,173
but actually will repeal rent control
throughout the state.

594
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,771
So San Francisco could lose
rent control next June.

595
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:28,079
Think of over 350,000 apartments

596
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:29,948
suddenly losing rent control
in San Francisco

597
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:32,682
and all the people
that could get displaced potentially

598
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:33,814
by something like that.

599
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:34,845
As far as I'm concerned,

600
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,985
it's the end of the whole East Side
of San Francisco.

601
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,291
The whole East Side
will just gentrify overnight.

602
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,787
And all of the great things
that we love about San Francisco

603
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,994
would be gone overnight.

604
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:57,070
# #

605
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:33,081
- # With every passing moment gone
another up, another down #

606
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:36,745
# Completely unbelievable #

607
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:40,620
# Back and forth
back and forth #

608
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:44,422
# Here I am tonight #

609
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,258
# Who knows how I got here? #

610
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,820
- Wow.

611
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:49,889
- What?

612
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,160
- The light.

613
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,189
- Oh, yeah.

614
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,328
I put that in there
'cause the fixture's too bright.

615
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,771
See?

616
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:01,299
All you need is a glow, mama.

617
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:07,037
You want some wine?

618
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,448
- Yes.

619
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:12,850
- # Amazing how the ceiling falls #

620
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:14,823
# Another twist
another tell #

621
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,223
- You keep it in there?

622
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,728
- Yeah.

623
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:23,789
- # Back and forth
back and forth #

624
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:27,394
# Here I am tonight #

625
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:30,837
# Who knows how I got here? #

626
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:34,206
# I'm too tired to fight #

627
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:40,011
# And you will every time #

628
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,073
- Thanks.

629
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:50,716
Not bad.

630
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,284
- Thanks.

631
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:55,559
- # You took my heart and flew away #

632
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:59,090
# You took my heart and flew away #

633
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:02,195
# You took my heart and flew away #

634
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:06,231
- Got to love that secondhand smoke.

635
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,783
All right.

636
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:19,254
<i>Under Pressure</i> or <i>Ice, Ice Baby?</i>

637
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:23,247
- <i>Under Pressure,</i>
no question.

638
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,919
- But Vanilla Ice used the beat better.

639
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:27,395
- I don't care.

640
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:30,661
Vanilla Ice versus Queen and Bowie?

641
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,932
No question.

642
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:37,439
I got one for you.

643
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,873
<i>Super Freak</i>
or <i>U Can't Touch This?</i>

644
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,900
- Oh, oh.

645
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:44,936
- And I'm not talking about the songs-
the videos.

646
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,243
- Oh, oh, shit.

647
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:47,806
- Yes.

648
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,545
- Um, okay.

649
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:53,954
Uh, <i>U Can't Touch This:</i>

650
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:57,983
Hammer with the big poofy pants,
bunch of thick chicks in kneepads,

651
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,358
everybody working it, right?

652
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,693
- Yes.

653
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,255
And <i>Super Freak,</i>

654
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:06,826
Rick James in a big white room
with some Euro hos

655
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:08,598
just grinding on him and his guitar?

656
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:09,764
Right?

657
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:10,794
- Yes.

658
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,569
Right.

659
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:17,341
- Uh, all right, I'm gonna
have to pay my respects

660
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,406
and go with Rick James
on this one.

661
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,349
Like, Hammer was tight and all,

662
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:26,344
but Big Rick,
he got that high angle going.

663
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,380
And he was just working it
on that guitar.

664
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:31,860
Like, them girls was just in the way,
and he was still just playing

665
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:33,862
and just calling 'em out by name,
just saying,

666
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:35,693
"You're a super freak."

667
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:40,566
Like, they can get mad and walk out.

668
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,595
That's how hard he was.

669
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:08,263
Hey, I'm gonna fix your bike for you.

670
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,033
- What's wrong with my bike?

671
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:15,060
- Your brakes were sticking.

672
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,731
- What?

673
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:19,434
- You should get yourself
a fixed-gear bike.

674
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,037
No, you'd be real hot.

675
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:25,047
You'd be like Mae Jemison,

676
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:31,247
first black woman to ride
a fixed-gear bike through the Marina.

677
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,313
Hell, you're probably the first
black woman in the Marina.

678
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:42,930
Hey, you ever think about how black folks
are only 7% of this city?

679
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:47,124
- You have a real issue with race.

680
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,193
You know that?

681
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:49,499
- Obviously, but I'm serious.

682
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,472
And this ain't the weed talking.

683
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:54,340
You ever think about
how we're only 7% of this city?

684
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:56,277
- You're not 7%.

685
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:57,336
You're Micah.

686
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,109
- You know what I mean.

687
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,776
Like, black folks are 7% of this city.

688
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:05,184
And then you take whatever,
1% or 2%

689
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:08,748
considers itself, like, punk
or indie or folk

690
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,954
or, you know,
just not what you see on BET,

691
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:15,225
like, you ever realize
just how few of us there really are?

692
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:17,164
- Mm, no.

693
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,188
- I mean, check it.

694
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,565
You might go to a show,

695
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:27,873
and for every, like, 300 people,
there's probably one black person.

696
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:31,368
And they're damn near guaranteed
to have their arm around somebody white.

697
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,311
I'm just saying.

698
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,689
All right, check it.

699
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,523
How do you define yourself?

700
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,222
- Excuse me?

701
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,628
- Like, how do you define yourself?

702
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,222
If you had to describe,

703
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:53,895
you know, your idea
of how you see the world,

704
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:56,700
like, how would you do it in one word?

705
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,400
- That makes no sense.

706
01:07:58,441 --> 01:07:59,533
People aren't that simple.

707
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,237
How can you define yourself in one word?

708
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,267
- Easy.

709
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:04,301
Me?

710
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:05,335
I'm a black man.

711
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,370
That's how I see the world.

712
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,882
That's how the world sees me.

713
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,909
But if I have to choose one,
I'm black before I'm a man.

714
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,820
So therefore, I am black.

715
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:16,689
- I don't see it that way.

716
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:20,388
- Why not?

717
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,659
- That's your problem.

718
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,928
You feel you have to define everybody.

719
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:28,266
You limit them to the point
where they're just a definition

720
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,602
and not people.

721
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:31,901
- How do you figure?

722
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,136
- You just said it.

723
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:36,508
You went from, "I am Micah,"

724
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,536
to, "I am black."

725
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:39,741
- I'm not?

726
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,979
- Yes, but you're everything else too.

727
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,851
- That's not how society sees it.

728
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:51,349
- Well, who gives a shit
about what society thinks?

729
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:59,427
I don't-
I don't want to talk anymore.

730
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,698
Let's-let's do something.

731
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,898
- What you want to do?

732
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:07,670
- I want to dance.

733
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,270
- All right.

734
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:13,338
White folks or black folks?

735
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:15,873
My bad.

736
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:17,909
But you are not taking this.

737
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:22,413
No, no, you are much too high
to ride a bicycle.

738
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:23,447
Mm-mm.

739
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:27,588
No, you can't toke and ride.

740
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:32,294
No, if you do that,
you'll give marijuana a bad name.

741
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,633
Go ahead and put those shoes on.

742
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,868
You don't want to go out there
in sock feet.

743
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:41,399
Then everybody will know you're high.

744
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:52,478
# #

745
01:09:53,989 --> 01:10:00,553
- # Baby, tell me please #

746
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:03,759
# Is this a dream #

747
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:11,638
# Spending the night with you
beneath the cherry trees? #

748
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:17,340
# Just make a wish #

749
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:21,748
# And everything comes true #

750
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:28,314
# Whoa, oh, whoa
oh, whoa, whoa #

751
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:31,451
# Whoa, oh, whoa
oh, whoa, whoa #

752
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:35,327
# Ah, ah, ah #

753
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:51,136
# #

754
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:31,951
- # You look like Audrey Hepburn
when you get all dressed up #

755
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:40,053
# I have seen all your movies
'cause Audrey's a stone fox #

756
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:43,997
# So let's ride bikes into the sea #

757
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:47,491
# And catch a bus outside the reef #

758
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:50,903
# Drive so deep where we can see #

759
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,534
# Thinks that we have to get off #

760
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:58,012
# The bus driver laughs,
and he shakes his head #

761
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,072
# Says, "You're okay" #

762
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,844
- # Tick-tock #

763
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:03,909
# I'm drinking alone #

764
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:04,941
# Tick-tock #

765
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,955
# I'm drinking alone #

766
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,457
# You take it like your perfect song #

767
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,583
# Well, come on #

768
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:11,593
# Tick-tock #

769
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:13,686
# I'm drinking alone #

770
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,434
- # Keep on rockin', baby #

771
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:30,438
# Come on #

772
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,201
# Keep on rockin', baby #

773
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,208
# Come on #

774
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,574
# Keep on rockin', baby #

775
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:42,580
- # She's got that look in her eyes #

776
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:44,381
# She's got too much on her mind #

777
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,409
# She wants to relax #

778
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:47,285
# She says she thinks it's time #

779
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:52,282
# And I know her fingers taste like home #

780
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:55,319
# She said "Go" #

781
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:02,560
# Just shut up #

782
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,799
# It's not like that #

783
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:08,139
# She retracts like a brick wall #

784
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:13,809
# Behind the cracks #

785
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:18,286
# Her eyes just pop like lightbulbs #

786
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,413
# And I know we can turn this #

787
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:26,156
# We can turn this round #

788
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:30,291
# Her eyes just pop like lightbulbs #

789
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,823
# And I know we can turn this #

790
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:35,428
# We can turn this round #

791
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,439
# But she won't try #

792
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,747
# She's got that blood in her eyes #

793
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,413
# She's got that blood on her thighs #

794
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:53,751
# She wants to react #

795
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,256
# But she can't cut the ties #

796
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,364
- Hello.
How you doing?

797
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:05,559
- Good.
- What are you having?

798
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:06,590
- Two tacos.

799
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:08,364
- Hot salsa or mild salsa?

800
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:09,427
- Hot.

801
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:11,336
- I'll have mild, mild.

802
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:12,362
- Mild.

803
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:14,534
- For here or to go?

804
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:19,036
- To go, to go, to go.

805
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,545
- Hey, what's going on, brah?

806
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:26,679
You need something?

807
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,017
- Ah, no, we're good, man.

808
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:30,081
We're good.

809
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,422
- No, check it, check it, check it.

810
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,620
Bust them out;
bust them out.

811
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:35,596
You know, we got that Formula 50, man,

812
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:39,533
Arizona Tea, Kombucha, and Sobe.

813
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:40,592
You know what I'm saying?

814
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:41,898
You look like you need
something up in you.

815
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:43,063
- No, we're good, man.

816
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:44,436
We're good.
Appreciate it.

817
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:47,533
- Man, you look like you need
some hydration in you, man, you know?

818
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,134
- No, man, I'm hydrated enough.

819
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:52,010
- All right, man, all right.

820
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:54,607
- I'm already hydrated.

821
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,175
- Two tacos, hot salsa.

822
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,208
- Yeah.

823
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:00,278
- Okay.

824
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,153
And two tacos with mild salsa.

825
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,179
- Oh, cool, man.

826
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,658
- Thanks a lot.

827
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:05,990
- How much do I owe you?

828
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,256
- Ooh.

829
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:59,071
- Who was that?

830
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,776
- What?

831
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:04,183
- Is it any surprise?

832
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:11,716
I mean, is it any surprise
that folks of color in the scene

833
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,321
date outside their race?

834
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:16,626
- Okay.

835
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:17,654
- I mean, think about it.

836
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:18,996
Like, everything-
- No.

837
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:20,023
- Every-think about it.

838
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:25,335
Everything about being indie
is all tied to not being black.

839
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:26,636
- I don't want to talk about this.

840
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:29,610
- Like, everything is all tied
to not being black.

841
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,113
Like, friends who are indie: white.

842
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,980
Bands who are indie:
like, okay, you got TV on the Radio,

843
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:36,177
but the rest of them are white.

844
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:37,651
- Okay.

845
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:41,144
- No, it's not okay.

846
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:42,747
It's not.
Like, everything.

847
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:48,855
I mean, people call it interracial dating,
but there's nothing interracial about it.

848
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:52,492
Nine out of ten times,
it's somebody of color

849
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:55,128
hanging on to a white person.

850
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,263
You never-you never see-

851
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:58,294
- Watch your step.

852
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,638
- Fuck my step.

853
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,904
You never see, like, a-

854
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:07,108
you never see a fucking, like,
a black girl and a Asian dude.

855
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:11,711
You never see an Indian guy
and a Latino girl.

856
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:14,381
It's always one of us
clinging on to one of them.

857
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:15,685
I mean, look at you.

858
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,158
Why the fuck you got to date
some white dude?

859
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:25,194
- Why are you doing this?

860
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,360
What do you want from me?

861
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:30,599
You think just because I'm black
and you're black

862
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:32,664
that we should just be together.

863
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,074
We're just one, right?

864
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:39,409
We fucked,
and I didn't even know you.

865
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:43,111
I've been spending the last 24 hours
cheating on my boyfriend,

866
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:45,949
and you think because I'm black
and you're black

867
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:48,455
that we should be together.

868
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:51,482
You're so fucking crazy.

869
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:27,979
Wait.

870
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:30,218
I have to go to the bathroom.

871
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,524
- I have to go too.

872
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:50,795
- I'm leaving.

873
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:56,701
- Wait.

874
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,372
- I have to go.

875
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:00,536
I'm leaving.

876
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:01,640
- It's okay.

877
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:06,943
- I got to go.

878
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:08,114
- Why?

879
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:14,754
Just stay here tonight

880
01:22:14,796 --> 01:22:17,458
and go back to your life tomorrow.

881
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:33,343
Just stay.

882
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:36,373
Stay.

883
01:24:54,456 --> 01:25:02,454
# #

884
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:16,307
- # You went out
with your best sweater on #

885
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:21,577
# With every intention
of dancing till dawn #

886
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:26,679
# But when the DJ played that song,
it all went wrong #

887
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:34,186
# Crying in the cab ride home #

888
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:40,896
# With Frank Sinatra on the radio #

889
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:43,460
# It might as well have been Lil Kim #

890
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:48,841
# When every song you hear
still reminds you of him #

891
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:53,242
# You'll say that it's no big deal #

892
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:58,082
# But it's the shake in your voice
that gives away how you feel #

893
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:05,150
# And you couldn't slam the door
any faster #

894
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:10,621
# Take your time #

895
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,295
# And you'll say that it's no big deal #

896
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:56,106
# But it's the tears on your face
that give away how you feel #

897
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:58,738
# And you'll say tonight #

898
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:03,547
# Tonight was a disaster #

899
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:11,583
# #
