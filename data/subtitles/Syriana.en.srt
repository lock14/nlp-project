1
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:22,044
Tehran, Iran

2
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:51,844
Bobby, where have you been?

3
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:53,644
Whiskey, whiskey.

4
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:57,044
- You want some whiskey?
- No, champagne.

5
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,444
- Champagne? Yeah.
- Bob.

6
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:01,344
My brother wants to know...

7
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:04,844
...have you ever tried liquid MDMA?

8
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:07,444
Liquid MDMA? No.

9
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:12,844
Tehran is the world capital.

10
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:14,244
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

11
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,744
You've got a... friend there.

12
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:26,744
How's the kid?

13
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:29,944
He's fine.

14
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,044
He's...

15
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:33,844
He's fine.

16
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:41,244
Arash, when you wanna do this?

17
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:44,544
After prayer.

18
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:51,344
Okay.

19
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:13,244
- You said they were both for you.
- What do you care?

20
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:43,744
Not a move!

21
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,644
Okay. Okay.

22
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:47,344
I was looking for the bathroom.

23
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:50,044
Not a word. Shut up!

24
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:52,044
Okay.

25
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:01,644
You don't speak Farsi, do you,
you son of a goat?

26
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:36,744
Georgetown
Washington, DC

27
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:49,444
Mr. Whiting, I'm Bennett Holiday.

28
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,444
A very big company, Connex, our client...

29
00:06:56,344 --> 00:07:01,544
...loses a huge natural-gas contract
in the Persian Gulf...

30
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:04,144
...to the Chinese. At the same time...

31
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:09,144
...a smaller company, Killen,
somehow gets the rights to Kazakhstan...

32
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:12,344
...one of the largest
untapped oil fields in the world.

33
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:15,844
The big company, our client,
merges with Killen...

34
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:19,144
...Justice wants to know
how Killen got those rights.

35
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:22,944
You've been scrutinizing
exactly these types of deals...

36
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:25,244
...so if there's something to find...

37
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,144
...I expect you to get it before they do.

38
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,444
And come straight to me.

39
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:36,944
Bennett.

40
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:38,544
Sir?

41
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:44,244
At my firm, I have a flock of sheep...

42
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:47,044
...who think they're lions.

43
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:52,544
Maybe you're a lion
everyone thinks is a sheep.

44
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,544
No, I wanna talk about the Gulf,
and how a goddamn emir...

45
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:01,044
Connex Oil
Houston, Texas

46
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:04,044
- What is an emir anyway?
- King, it's a king.

47
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:09,044
A king. Well, how some Podunk king
tossed you out on your ass.

48
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:14,244
Every company in the world
wanted into Kazakhstan...

49
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:17,744
...into the Tengiz, but Killen got it.

50
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:22,344
And then Connex wanted Killen,
and here we are.

51
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:28,144
I made investments.

52
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:32,244
Investments that'll bear fruit
for this company.

53
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:37,144
Hell, Tommy, we've all got
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act...

54
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:39,544
...committed to memory.

55
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:43,744
I got a little copy of it taped
to the wall of my head. Right here.

56
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:46,644
Thanks, Jimmy.
We appreciate hearing your point of view.

57
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,144
However, a U.S. Attorney...

58
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:53,244
...is looking into your relationships
in Kazakhstan...

59
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:56,744
...and the U.S. government is holding off
on approval of our merger.

60
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:58,544
So Mr. Janus and I have brought...

61
00:08:58,744 --> 00:09:00,944
...Connex's Washington counsel,
Sydney Hewitt...

62
00:09:01,144 --> 00:09:04,444
...down here to talk about
our strategy for the next 30 days.

63
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,344
Sydney?

64
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:16,144
In a way, I feel like Switzerland.

65
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:22,044
I'd like to remind everybody in this room
they've signed confidentiality agreements.

66
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:28,144
Allow me to introduce my associate,
Bennett Holiday...

67
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:30,944
...who will be... How shall I put it?

68
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:34,344
- building consensus day-to-day.

69
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:35,744
Good morning.

70
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:54,244
You've just visited what
someday soon...

71
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:56,944
...could be the most profitable
corporation in America.

72
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:58,944
Provided the government
approves the merger.

73
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:01,644
Provided we don't start
running automobiles on water.

74
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:04,644
And provided there's still chaos
in the Middle East.

75
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:08,244
Now the job is, find the problem,
fix the problem.

76
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:12,044
And if you do not find a problem,
then there is no problem.

77
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,944
And when the government
approves this merger...

78
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:17,444
...it's gonna buy a lot of houses
in the Vineyard.

79
00:10:17,644 --> 00:10:19,444
Maybe even yours.

80
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:23,944
Geneva, Switzerland

81
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:37,544
Cheerios again?

82
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:41,844
- Max!
- Max!

83
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:49,744
- Hey, man.
- Let's not read at the table, okay?

84
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:52,144
- Put this hand here. Block me.
- Sweetie, sweetie.

85
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:54,544
- Mommy? I want bacon.
- Yeah?

86
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:57,544
- You have bacon.
- I want real bacon.

87
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:01,344
You have real bacon,
only it's made from soy beans.

88
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:04,944
I want pig bacon.

89
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:08,044
I want pig bacon too.

90
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,144
- Don't say it.
- I'll try it if you try it.

91
00:11:12,344 --> 00:11:14,444
- I don't know if I can bite this.
- It's crunchy.

92
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,944
- How'd you do that?
- It's kind of hard to cut.

93
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:23,244
- It's pretty bad.
- You be quiet.

94
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:28,744
<i>A merger between two U.S. oil companies
is taking place in Houston.</i>

95
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:31,744
<i>The new company,
Connex-Killen Corporation...</i>

96
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:35,544
<i>... will become the fifth largest
oil and gas company in the world.</i>

97
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:40,444
<i>The move affects 37,000 workers
in 160 countries...</i>

98
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:45,044
<i>... and, with revenues larger than the gross
domestic product of Pakistan or Denmark...</i>

99
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,944
<i>... will create the world's
23rd largest economy.</i>

100
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:53,244
<i>Mr. Leland Janus, chairman of Connex,
spoke today of synergy...</i>

101
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:56,444
<i>... and a desire to pass on savings
to the consumer.</i>

102
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:59,244
The merged operations
will create economies of scale...

103
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:03,044
...to deliver the best products to
the consumer at the lowest possible prices.

104
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,744
LELAND JANUS
CEO, CONNEX OIL

105
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:07,844
<i>It's a merger of necessity
for Connex, Rebecca...</i>

106
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:12,044
<i>... who wants Killen's fields in Kazakhstan,
after gas blocks they pursued in the Gulf...</i>

107
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:14,444
<i>... were awarded
to a Chinese consortium.</i>

108
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:17,844
<i>Producer nations continue to look
toward developing markets in Asia...</i>

109
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:20,444
<i>... which is having a powerful effect
on crude prices.</i>

110
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:24,644
<i>There's at least 10 to 12 dollars
of instability premium.</i>

111
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:28,044
You have protests in Iran,
the threat of more strikes in Venezuela...

112
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:32,644
...and the Turks still making noise about
Russian crude through the Bosphorus.

113
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:35,544
All right, thanks for having me, Rebecca.

114
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:41,344
<i>I'm playing. That's my job, playing.</i>

115
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:45,444
Yeah, well, that's a very,
very good job for you to have.

116
00:12:45,644 --> 00:12:48,644
<i>- Tell Daddy you love him.
- I love you, Daddy.</i>

117
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,144
Hey.

118
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:56,444
The emir's summer party,
Marbella, this weekend.

119
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,244
Any interest?

120
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,344
Well, I can't. I got, you know...

121
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:02,944
Guy could be huge
for the company, Bryan.

122
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:06,344
It's Maxie's birthday this weekend, so...
So we have Saturday...

123
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:10,444
Hey, Bryan, I just need your help on this...
The emir's party. I'll take that.

124
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:13,244
Through finagling,
we have an audience with the emir.

125
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,244
He wrote the strategy, and he's not slick.

126
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:17,944
I'll bet you a thousand he can't sell it.

127
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:19,244
I didn't say I could go.

128
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:20,644
Dollars or Swiss francs?

129
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:22,244
- Dollars.
- Fine.

130
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:27,044
Come on. Take the children with you.
The beach, summer, Marbella. Max'll love it.

131
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:29,544
- Can I do that?
- Sure you can.

132
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:31,744
Besides, they love children.

133
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,144
John D. Rockefeller.
Founded the University of Chicago.

134
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:37,544
Come on.

135
00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:59,744
<i>That's fine. You're a good song leader,
Mr. Rockefeller.</i>

136
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:06,344
The Persian Gulf

137
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:44,544
The Connex/ Al-Salwa facility
is under new ownership...

138
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:48,344
...and your services are no longer needed.

139
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:56,344
What did he say? I can't hear.

140
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:57,844
He's telling us to scram.

141
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:59,244
"Scram"?

142
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:02,844
What do you mean, "scram"?

143
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:08,844
Your immigration permit through
this company is no longer valid.

144
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:14,744
You must report to the Department
of lmmigration within two weeks...

145
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:18,844
...or you may be deported.

146
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:25,044
The Chinese are smart people,
but such bad drivers.

147
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:28,544
They should not be allowed
even to wash cars.

148
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:36,044
When I was your age, in Pakistan,
there was always in the distance...

149
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,944
Snow-covered mountains.
Yes, I know, Papa.

150
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:41,544
That's right.

151
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:46,144
Three hours away, but right there...

152
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:49,244
...across the entire sky...

153
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:52,944
...like you could reach out
and touch them.

154
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:56,444
Snow-covered mountains.

155
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,544
As soon as we can...

156
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:06,244
...we'll get a house and bring
your mother here.

157
00:16:07,144 --> 00:16:08,844
I promise.

158
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,744
<i>Bob's freaking out
about this other missile.</i>

159
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:38,544
"Where's the missile? Who has it?"
He wrote a memo.

160
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:40,744
Central Intelligence Agency
Langley, Virginia

161
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:43,344
I just finished convincing
Brit and French intel...

162
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,944
...we had nothing to do
with the Amiri job.

163
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:49,144
What do we say to them now?
"Well, something's missing."

164
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:52,744
<i>He's gotta stop this.
He's gotta stop with the memos.</i>

165
00:16:57,744 --> 00:17:01,244
<i>Okay. Here's something.
You put him up for promotion.</i>

166
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:04,644
He's due. He's a good man.
He saved our ass in Beirut in '85.

167
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:07,844
That's great. Terry likes him.
We'll get him an audition downtown.

168
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,344
<i>You get him an audition downtown.</i>

169
00:17:10,544 --> 00:17:13,044
<i>They're going crazy about Iran now.
Bob's an expert.</i>

170
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:14,744
<i>Speaks Farsi, for chrissake.</i>

171
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:17,644
<i>Bob has never had a desk job.</i>

172
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:20,144
<i>He's never done 9 to 5,
never been on committee.</i>

173
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:23,944
He's gotta show up to work every day.
He's gotta stay on message.

174
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,744
Absolutely.

175
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:30,544
<i>I'll prep him.</i>

176
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:34,244
In fact, we just pulled
one of our officers out.

177
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,944
I took the initiative to ask him
to come down here.

178
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:42,544
He infiltrated Hezbollah in Beirut
in the '80s, won himself some nice medals.

179
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,744
We're thinking about
giving him a station.

180
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:48,444
Beirut in the '80s,
is that a résumé-builder?

181
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,844
Don't chomp down on any bait.

182
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:54,244
We're fine.

183
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:56,244
Iran is fine.

184
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:57,944
Fine.

185
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:03,644
And our analysis seems to be on the mark.
We're getting good satellite coverage.

186
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:05,944
We're reprogramming resources
into Iran...

187
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:09,144
Thank you for coming.
Welcome back and forgive me if I wade in...

188
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:12,244
...but forgetting for a second
your bureaucratic checklist...

189
00:18:12,444 --> 00:18:15,844
...l'm trying to get
undigested information.

190
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:21,244
- Well, to the best of our ability...
- India is now our ally. Russia is our ally.

191
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:22,944
Even China will be an ally.

192
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,444
Everybody between Morocco
and Pakistan is the problem.

193
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:32,044
Failed states and failed economies,
but Iran is a natural cultural ally of the U.S.

194
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,244
Persians do not want to roll back
the clock to the eighth century.

195
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:39,144
I see students marching in the streets.
I hear Khatami making the right sounds.

196
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:43,244
And what I'd like to know is,
if we keep embargoing them on energy...

197
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:46,244
...then someday soon,
are we gonna have a nice, secular...

198
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:49,444
...pro-Western, pro-business government?

199
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:56,144
It's possible. It's complicated.

200
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,344
Of course it is. Thank you for your time.

201
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:10,744
They let young people march in the street.
Next day, they shut down 50 newspapers.

202
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:15,144
<i>Put a few satellite dishes up on the roofs,
let them have My Two Dads.</i>

203
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:16,844
That doesn't mean the ayatollahs...

204
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:20,444
...are surrendering one iota of control
over that nation.

205
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:22,644
Mr. Barnes,
the reform movement in Iran...

206
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:25,844
...is one of the president's
great hopes for the region...

207
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:29,644
...and crucial to the petroleum security
of the United States.

208
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:33,044
These gentlemen are with the CLI.

209
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:40,344
The Committee for the Liberation of Iran,
Mr. Barnes.

210
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:46,744
Princeton, New Jersey

211
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:53,844
Maybe you'll get made ambassador
to somewhere cool.

212
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:57,744
Like France or Italy or Ghana.

213
00:19:58,044 --> 00:20:02,044
It's not beyond the realm
of possibility, is it?

214
00:20:05,044 --> 00:20:06,844
How's your mom?

215
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:10,044
Great. She's great.

216
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,844
So I know it's still a year away...

217
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:16,344
...but I'll have to have a car,
a decent car.

218
00:20:16,544 --> 00:20:22,044
Nothing too fancy, but it has to run
so that I can get into Boston and New York.

219
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:25,144
They have a great crew.
That's what they told me.

220
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:27,844
I said, "Crew of what?"
And they said, "Rowing."

221
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:30,444
- So if I wanna row, it'd be kind of fun.
- Thank you.

222
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:32,444
Robby, listen.

223
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:35,344
I live in Maryland...

224
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:40,844
...which means that you have
residency in Maryland.

225
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:43,244
For the University of Maryland.

226
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:51,244
I'm sorry, can I steal this from you?
Thank you so much.

227
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:57,344
I just want a normal senior year, Dad.

228
00:20:57,744 --> 00:20:59,944
I want a normal house.

229
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:02,944
I want Cinemax and prom.

230
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:06,144
You know what prom is like in Pakistan?
Prom sucks in Pakistan.

231
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:08,744
It's complicated, you know.

232
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:11,344
I may have really screwed up at work.

233
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:12,944
How?

234
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:15,544
I was supposed to keep
my mouth shut and I didn't.

235
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:25,044
What does Mom do, again,
that we have to live in Islamabad?

236
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:37,244
- She's a secretary.
- Secretary.

237
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,444
Robby.

238
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:46,744
Both of my parents are professional liars.

239
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:48,344
Hey.

240
00:21:56,144 --> 00:21:58,244
Did you guys just get a party?

241
00:21:58,444 --> 00:22:00,144
I do too.

242
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:04,144
This is a party not for you.

243
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:08,844
Marbella, Spain

244
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:14,444
<i>It is my pleasure to personally welcome
each of you...</i>

245
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:15,744
All right, guys.

246
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:17,544
<i>... to the Casa de las Palmas...</i>

247
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:20,044
<i>... our oasis of palms in the south of Spain.</i>

248
00:22:20,244 --> 00:22:22,544
- Does somebody live here?
- Yeah, in the summertime.

249
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:28,344
<i>I hope everyone is having
a wonderful day...</i>

250
00:22:29,044 --> 00:22:34,744
<i>... and taking time from your hectic lives
to relax with friends and family...</i>

251
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:39,544
<i>... whether it is enjoying the flowers in our
bountiful gardens...</i>

252
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:44,544
<i>... or sampling the myriad delicacies...</i>

253
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:48,744
<i>... prepared by chefs from
our prosperous home.</i>

254
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:53,144
Please eat and socialize...

255
00:22:53,744 --> 00:22:58,344
...and enjoy your time with us.

256
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:06,744
I am happy to welcome the Chinese
to my country.

257
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:11,344
My father welcomes the Chinese
to our country.

258
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:14,244
Of course.

259
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:18,244
Please.

260
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:20,644
Right there.

261
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:25,644
Thank you.

262
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:32,644
Arabs are very family-oriented,
as a people.

263
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:35,644
Is that racist?

264
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:37,444
Sure.

265
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:40,044
- It is?
- A little.

266
00:23:40,344 --> 00:23:43,544
Well, no. I mean, I guess
if what you're saying is positive.

267
00:23:47,544 --> 00:23:49,544
You have to go in.

268
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:52,844
Don't.

269
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:57,944
Let him work it out on his own.
It's important for his autonomy.

270
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:07,144
All right!

271
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:23,944
An announcement.

272
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,644
If man is made in God's image...

273
00:24:27,744 --> 00:24:31,644
...then God is deeply messed up.

274
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:41,844
You afraid?

275
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:43,044
Afraid of the buzz?

276
00:24:43,244 --> 00:24:44,744
I'm afraid of your breath.

277
00:24:44,844 --> 00:24:47,844
Hakim hasn't had any.
And he wears jewelry.

278
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:52,944
He thinks that little bracelet's gonna
get him girls.

279
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:54,644
Hakim!

280
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,344
<i>Hakim! Hakim! Hakim!</i>

281
00:25:00,744 --> 00:25:03,044
I want to talk to your uncle about work.

282
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:05,244
There isn't any work.

283
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:06,644
Farooq!

284
00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:07,944
You said you'd introduce me.

285
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:09,444
Don't be such a pest.

286
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:11,944
Hakim! Hakim!

287
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,444
Are you here to see the emir?

288
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:16,144
Yeah.

289
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:18,644
Me too.

290
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:22,944
What do you do?

291
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:28,844
I'm a partner in
a derivatives-trading company in Geneva.

292
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,544
- Energy?
- Yeah.

293
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:33,044
Right.

294
00:25:33,244 --> 00:25:34,644
- Bryan Woodman?
- Yes.

295
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:36,244
- Good evening.
- Hi.

296
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,444
Hi, Bryan Woodman.

297
00:25:38,644 --> 00:25:41,544
We regret that His Highness
will be unable to see you.

298
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:45,644
However, we are authorized
to hear your proposition on his behalf.

299
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,844
Oh, okay.

300
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:53,044
What, here? Now?

301
00:25:56,644 --> 00:25:59,244
Okay. Well...

302
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:04,444
Okay. Our position is that
the real worry for you guys...

303
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:07,044
...is another year of record pricing.

304
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:11,644
There are no more elephant fields,
not even in natural gas...

305
00:26:11,844 --> 00:26:14,744
...and as structural alternatives
become more fully realized...

306
00:26:14,944 --> 00:26:19,344
...you'll need new strategies to maximize
every penny of your existing resources...

307
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,544
...particularly in a climate
of falling prices.

308
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:27,344
And that's what, you know, our firm is
prepared to help problem-solve with you...

309
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,344
...the, you know, foreseeable...

310
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:34,444
...and unforeseeable problems
you encounter.

311
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:40,144
This house is a Genius-Home.

312
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:43,144
One of my sons had it wired by experts
from the United States.

313
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:44,344
Watch.

314
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,544
Your Highness, that is incredible.

315
00:26:56,644 --> 00:27:00,444
Prince Nasir, isn't that amazing?

316
00:27:01,944 --> 00:27:03,144
Fascinating.

317
00:27:04,244 --> 00:27:06,944
The Chinese take the trouble
to learn Arabic.

318
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:08,844
Look, it's getting dark.

319
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,244
Better turn on the pool lights.

320
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:22,744
Send a fool on a fool's errand.

321
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:26,844
Moussa, come fix this remote control!

322
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,144
Are you not talking?

323
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:56,544
Come on, sweetheart.
Just a little bit, okay?

324
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:59,944
You're the shark, and you try
to tag us as we swim across.

325
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:02,444
All right? You jump in,
count "one, two, three"...

326
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:04,444
...then we try to get to the other side.

327
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:07,144
- All right? Okay.
- Okay. Come on.

328
00:28:07,344 --> 00:28:09,244
Come on, go. Go.

329
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:13,944
Yeah. Okay.

330
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:18,644
- Come on, jump in.
- Come on.

331
00:28:18,844 --> 00:28:21,244
- Come on. Jump in!
- Sissy!

332
00:28:21,844 --> 00:28:23,944
Just jump, come on!

333
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:36,344
Max?

334
00:28:36,544 --> 00:28:38,344
- Max!
- Oh, my God!

335
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:42,744
Cut the power! Cut the power!

336
00:28:43,544 --> 00:28:45,344
Max! Max!

337
00:28:45,444 --> 00:28:47,444
- Let go!
- Somebody cut the power!

338
00:28:51,944 --> 00:28:54,544
- Max!
- Come on. Come on.

339
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:56,844
- That's my son!
- Oh, my God.

340
00:28:57,044 --> 00:28:58,444
- Get out of my way!
- Okay.

341
00:28:58,544 --> 00:28:59,944
- Oh, my God!
- Take him!

342
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:03,944
Take him! Take him out.
Take him this way. Take him out.

343
00:29:04,444 --> 00:29:06,144
Put him down. Down, down.

344
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:09,444
- Sweetie?
- Someone get a doctor, doctor, doctor!

345
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:11,444
He's not breathing. He's not breathing.

346
00:29:11,644 --> 00:29:13,744
- Get a doctor!
- Is anybody a doctor?

347
00:29:14,144 --> 00:29:16,544
Do something! Help us!

348
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:26,644
<i>I hear phrases thrown around like
"the corrupting influence of money"...</i>

349
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:28,244
Washington, DC

350
00:29:28,444 --> 00:29:31,844
<i>... or "the evil influence
of dollars in politics "...</i>

351
00:29:32,044 --> 00:29:34,844
<i>... when more money was spent
on the syndication rights...</i>

352
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:37,644
<i>... to the Seinfeld television program...</i>

353
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:41,744
<i>... than on the whole of
the last presidential election.</i>

354
00:29:41,944 --> 00:29:45,144
<i>Last election cycle,
I spent $300,000.</i>

355
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,844
<i>I have pictures of myself with the president
that I use all over the world.</i>

356
00:29:48,944 --> 00:29:50,544
I didn't make this coffee for you.

357
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:54,644
<i>People don't know Danny Dalton, but they
know the president of the United States...</i>

358
00:29:58,344 --> 00:30:00,144
<i>- In a free society...
- Making it for me.</i>

359
00:30:00,244 --> 00:30:01,944
<i>... the one written into law...</i>

360
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:03,744
You...

361
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:06,744
<i>- ... it's the people, individually...
...l'm making oatmeal.</i>

362
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:09,344
<i>- ... and organized into committees...
- Then you sleep.</i>

363
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:11,944
<i>... not the U.S. government,
who decide the issues....</i>

364
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,444
You look like shit.

365
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:15,744
<i>... of a political campaign.</i>

366
00:30:15,844 --> 00:30:18,244
<i>In our country, we don't...</i>

367
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:21,644
<i>... stuff dollars into ballot boxes.</i>

368
00:30:21,844 --> 00:30:23,144
<i>- What we do...
- You working?</i>

369
00:30:23,244 --> 00:30:25,844
<i>- ... is turn money into votes.
- I had trouble at work.</i>

370
00:30:26,044 --> 00:30:27,444
<i>The ability of a candidate...</i>

371
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:30,244
There's beer in my fridge,
so you don't die of the DTs.

372
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:31,844
Please don't smoke in my house.

373
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:38,144
<i>- meaning, not so loosely translated,
that money is speech.</i>

374
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:45,044
<i>And, last time I heard, speech in
the United States of America is protected.</i>

375
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:50,044
<i>You can't limit my advocacy
just because it works.</i>

376
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:57,644
<i>I have a sovereign, inalienable right
to petition my government.</i>

377
00:30:58,244 --> 00:31:01,644
<i>And why is it some dirty little secret...</i>

378
00:31:01,844 --> 00:31:07,644
...that it's in America's interest
to do business overseas?

379
00:31:34,044 --> 00:31:37,544
Two of my wife's kids were deported
from this country.

380
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:39,744
You know why?
Because they didn't have work.

381
00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:41,344
You don't have to pay me.

382
00:31:41,544 --> 00:31:44,544
Give me something to do.

383
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:46,844
Then decide.

384
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:53,244
I'm sorry. I already have a
long list for that job too.

385
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,644
And if you want to work in this country...

386
00:31:56,744 --> 00:31:58,144
...learn the language.

387
00:31:58,344 --> 00:32:00,544
Learn Arabic!

388
00:32:05,244 --> 00:32:09,044
Foreign workers' compound
The Persian Gulf

389
00:32:16,444 --> 00:32:18,044
Why are they running?

390
00:32:19,244 --> 00:32:21,244
Maybe the small one...

391
00:32:22,144 --> 00:32:25,444
...committed a crime or something.

392
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:33,044
They gave us french fries
at the Islamic school.

393
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:40,044
Close the door, Papa.

394
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:43,844
His sister has a thing for you.

395
00:32:44,244 --> 00:32:46,644
His sister has a big ass.

396
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:50,044
Of course, at the Islamic school you
don't have to worry about that.

397
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:53,244
And lamb. We got skewers of lamb.

398
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:55,644
I like lamb.

399
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:06,944
<i>Have your identification card ready.
No talking in line.</i>

400
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:14,444
<i>Have your identification card ready.
No talking in line.</i>

401
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:19,144
I can't remember it this hot.

402
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:21,844
Old man, you don't want to talk here.

403
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:23,044
Stop talking.

404
00:33:26,044 --> 00:33:27,944
Tough guy.
What's your name?

405
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:29,444
What's your name?!

406
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:31,044
Johnny.

407
00:34:50,144 --> 00:34:52,144
Mommy!

408
00:34:57,844 --> 00:34:59,744
Mommy!

409
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:03,844
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Mommy.

410
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,944
Come here, bear. Come here.

411
00:35:07,144 --> 00:35:08,444
You okay?

412
00:35:08,644 --> 00:35:11,044
I wanna look out the window.

413
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:14,644
You wanna look out the window?
Come on.

414
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,944
I spy a bird.

415
00:35:32,744 --> 00:35:36,744
<i>Well, if on Monday,
Iran refuses the IAEA inspectors...</i>

416
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:39,544
<i>... you can look to crude prices
to spike yet again.</i>

417
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:48,444
Right. Well, it's not exactly a secret
that Iran will refuse snap inspections.

418
00:35:50,544 --> 00:35:52,944
Okay, Rebecca. Thank you.

419
00:35:56,044 --> 00:35:57,644
Go home.

420
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:01,844
It was a stupid fucking question, Henry.

421
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:06,144
The prince's man called again.

422
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:09,544
I'm just telling him.

423
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,544
U.S. Department of Justice
Washington, DC

424
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:25,044
Hey, how bad is it?

425
00:36:26,744 --> 00:36:28,844
When a Volvo dealer says that...

426
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:31,944
Okay. You're honorable, decent guys.

427
00:36:32,044 --> 00:36:33,444
Right.

428
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:36,644
My wife and our narrow driveway...

429
00:36:36,744 --> 00:36:39,444
- How the hell are you?
- Well, you know, can't complain.

430
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:42,844
That's not good, kiddo.
That's suffering quietly.

431
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:45,044
Married? Kids?

432
00:36:47,444 --> 00:36:49,944
There is no way a company like Killen...

433
00:36:50,044 --> 00:36:52,844
...pulled off a deal like this
without paying somebody off.

434
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,744
Why don't you tell me what you have
so I can respond.

435
00:36:57,044 --> 00:36:59,644
I used to think there was
something wrong here.

436
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:02,144
Now I know there's
something wrong here.

437
00:37:06,244 --> 00:37:09,544
Either you don't find anything,
because you don't know how to look...

438
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:14,444
...or you do and they carve you out
and light you on fire.

439
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:17,544
That's gotta be the play here, right?

440
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:21,444
Bennett Holiday.

441
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:24,244
Sydney Hewitt's new boy.

442
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:26,544
How many of those have I seen?

443
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,144
Six? Seven?

444
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:31,744
They're all gone.

445
00:37:31,944 --> 00:37:34,544
He's still Sydney-fucking-Hewitt.

446
00:37:36,844 --> 00:37:38,344
Fourteen-11.

447
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:40,144
Match point.

448
00:37:40,744 --> 00:37:43,244
I think they've got someone
inside the deal.

449
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:44,744
Someone they can squeeze.

450
00:37:45,644 --> 00:37:48,444
You mean like an informant?

451
00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:52,544
Yes, sir, like an informant. Just my opinion,
based on their overconfidence.

452
00:37:52,844 --> 00:37:54,644
Match point.

453
00:38:03,544 --> 00:38:05,044
Thank you.

454
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:10,644
You know, if people in oil deals...

455
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:14,444
...talked to U.S. Attorneys,
there'd be no oil business. Dean.

456
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:18,544
Bennett Holiday, you know Dean Whiting,
founding partner of our firm.

457
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:20,744
- Good to see you, sir.
- How are you?

458
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:23,444
We've been discussing
the Connex-Killen merger situation.

459
00:38:23,644 --> 00:38:26,744
Will they get approval?
Hell of a large company if they do.

460
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:28,444
I mean, client.

461
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:31,644
Well, the Tengiz field,
Killen's largest asset...

462
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:35,544
...is being looked into pretty heavily
by the U.S. Attorney's office.

463
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:37,744
Well, Bennett, as they say in the Bible:

464
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:41,244
"There are many, many ways
to light Europe."

465
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:02,744
<i>Yeah, well, there's an arrow on the ceiling
pointing towards Mecca.</i>

466
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:06,144
The Binladin Group
air-conditioned Mecca.

467
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,844
It was a huge project.
They made billions and billions.

468
00:39:12,744 --> 00:39:16,444
<i>All the women are dressed in black
from head to toe...</i>

469
00:39:16,644 --> 00:39:19,044
<i>... walking 5 feet behind the men.</i>

470
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:24,644
<i>It's 125.</i>

471
00:39:24,844 --> 00:39:27,644
<i>Literally, 125 and humid.</i>

472
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:31,744
<i>When I walked out of the airport,
it was like a wall fell on me.</i>

473
00:39:33,444 --> 00:39:35,844
<i>The men are all wearing white sheets.</i>

474
00:39:36,044 --> 00:39:40,344
<i>And they're spotless white sheets.
I don't really understand that.</i>

475
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:42,444
<i>They kind of say:</i>

476
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:45,844
<i>"It's hot and I don't have to work."</i>

477
00:39:46,044 --> 00:39:48,444
<i>I don't understand how
you could do anything in that.</i>

478
00:39:48,644 --> 00:39:50,944
<i>I'd like to see these guys play baseball.</i>

479
00:39:55,744 --> 00:39:57,644
Are you okay?

480
00:39:58,844 --> 00:40:00,644
<i>You sound strange.</i>

481
00:40:00,844 --> 00:40:02,744
No, I'm fine.

482
00:40:25,644 --> 00:40:27,844
They will try to disguise the difference...

483
00:40:28,044 --> 00:40:31,444
...to make Muslims who speak
about religion...

484
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,744
...appear to be fanatics
or backward people.

485
00:40:34,844 --> 00:40:39,144
They will tell us the dispute is over
economic resources...

486
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:41,244
...or military domination.

487
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:45,244
If we believe that,
we play right into their hands...

488
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:49,844
...with only ourselves to blame.

489
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:51,744
It is not possible...

490
00:40:51,944 --> 00:40:54,744
...to bridge the divide
between human nature...

491
00:40:55,144 --> 00:40:57,944
...and modern life through free trade.

492
00:40:58,144 --> 00:40:59,244
Impossible.

493
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:04,244
The divine and the worldly
are but a single concept.

494
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:06,444
The Koran.

495
00:41:06,944 --> 00:41:11,544
No separation of religion and state.

496
00:41:12,844 --> 00:41:14,144
The Koran.

497
00:41:15,144 --> 00:41:18,244
Instead of kings legislating
and slaves obeying...

498
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,744
...the Koran.

499
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:24,544
The pain of modern life
cannot be cured by...

500
00:41:24,744 --> 00:41:26,544
...deregulation...

501
00:41:26,644 --> 00:41:28,044
...privatization...

502
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:29,444
...economic reform...

503
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:31,244
...or lower taxes.

504
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:35,944
The pain of living in the modern world...

505
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:38,544
...will never be solved by a liberal society.

506
00:41:41,744 --> 00:41:44,344
Liberal societies have failed.

507
00:41:44,844 --> 00:41:46,944
Christian theology has failed.

508
00:41:47,544 --> 00:41:49,344
The West has failed.

509
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:55,744
This was a birthday and graduation present
a couple years ago.

510
00:41:55,844 --> 00:41:57,144
Cap d'Antibes, France

511
00:41:57,244 --> 00:42:00,044
What happened was,
I was about to graduate from Oxford...

512
00:42:00,244 --> 00:42:04,544
...and my mother had a horse
in the Royal Ascot race, right?

513
00:42:04,744 --> 00:42:06,944
The horse won...

514
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:10,544
...that same day that I was graduating.
And my trust fund matured.

515
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:15,044
So that tops any birthday present that
any of you have bought for me tonight.

516
00:42:18,844 --> 00:42:22,744
Capitalism cannot exist without waste.

517
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:26,444
We should write thank-you notes
to Mr. Whiting and the U.S. A...

518
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,244
...for producing one-quarter
of the world's garbage...

519
00:42:29,444 --> 00:42:31,644
...and one-quarter of the demand.

520
00:42:32,044 --> 00:42:33,844
You're certainly welcome.

521
00:42:34,044 --> 00:42:35,744
Our pleasure, really.

522
00:42:39,144 --> 00:42:40,844
Prince...

523
00:42:41,944 --> 00:42:45,644
...is there anything
that we can do for you?

524
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:50,444
Americans are always happy to drill holes
in other people's countries.

525
00:42:50,744 --> 00:42:55,944
I've heard of you, Mr. Whiting.
The cat's-paw of the Saudi princes.

526
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:02,844
I know your brother, the foreign minister.
He's very bright.

527
00:43:03,044 --> 00:43:04,244
I know your father too.

528
00:43:04,844 --> 00:43:08,444
He threw the second creepiest party
I've ever been to in Washington.

529
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:11,044
And as far as I can see...

530
00:43:11,744 --> 00:43:15,744
...you could probably use
a bit of the cat's-paw yourself.

531
00:43:16,244 --> 00:43:20,144
Second-born son,
so beaten down by his family...

532
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:24,044
...he can't even tell me what he wants
when he's asked straight-out.

533
00:43:24,244 --> 00:43:28,244
A grown-up baby
who's afraid of his brother...

534
00:43:29,844 --> 00:43:32,844
...and maybe wants to be king?

535
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,244
Maybe?

536
00:43:36,444 --> 00:43:38,844
Well, prince...

537
00:43:39,644 --> 00:43:41,844
...are you a king?

538
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:45,044
Can you tell me what you want?

539
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,044
<i>All right, what's next?</i>

540
00:43:52,144 --> 00:43:54,344
<i>The lethal finding on Nasir came through.</i>

541
00:43:54,544 --> 00:43:57,044
<i>That was quick. You have a timetable?</i>

542
00:43:57,244 --> 00:44:00,044
<i>He'll be in Beirut next week.
We could do it there.</i>

543
00:44:00,244 --> 00:44:02,544
<i>That's good. Anybody around?</i>

544
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:05,444
<i>Actually, yes.
I made contact with Mussawi.</i>

545
00:44:05,544 --> 00:44:07,844
<i>He'd be happy to work
with whoever we send.</i>

546
00:44:09,344 --> 00:44:11,944
I was thinking it would be good for Bob.

547
00:44:15,744 --> 00:44:18,344
I'll let you have him
without going through Terry...

548
00:44:18,544 --> 00:44:21,544
...but everything better go exactly right.

549
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:24,344
And tell him, "Easy on the memos."

550
00:44:24,544 --> 00:44:28,544
This is the prototype
of an oil-rich Arab monarchy.

551
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:33,244
Since prevailing in the tribal conflicts
of the 1920s...

552
00:44:33,444 --> 00:44:37,144
...the Al-Subaai family have ruled
their kingdom effectively...

553
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,944
...and, by most accounts, benignly.

554
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:44,044
However, they face enormous challenges
in the future.

555
00:44:44,444 --> 00:44:47,544
The fact of the matter is that
at current levels of production...

556
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:49,644
- Welcome, Bob.
- Hi.

557
00:44:49,844 --> 00:44:53,444
Good news. I think we've got something
for you, something you'll like...

558
00:44:53,644 --> 00:44:57,944
...that utilizes your specific skill set.

559
00:44:58,744 --> 00:45:00,744
You know this guy?

560
00:45:01,944 --> 00:45:05,344
- Prince Nasir Al-Subaai.
- His money's in a lot of dark corners...

561
00:45:05,544 --> 00:45:08,944
...paying for weapons
that could be used against the U.S.A.

562
00:45:11,444 --> 00:45:13,444
Paperwork on polygraphs.

563
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,344
Wire transfers to Qaeda fronts.

564
00:45:15,544 --> 00:45:19,544
Letters instructing his water ministry
to employ Mohammed Sheik Agiza...

565
00:45:19,644 --> 00:45:21,444
...the guy who has your missile.

566
00:45:21,544 --> 00:45:24,144
He's traveling to Beirut.
You have experience in Beirut.

567
00:45:24,344 --> 00:45:26,144
It's a great city.

568
00:45:26,944 --> 00:45:28,744
This is a bad guy.

569
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:32,444
And, who knows, maybe you'll find
your blue-eyed Egyptian.

570
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:36,144
- I sent you a report on...
- Sorry, I gotta get going.

571
00:45:36,344 --> 00:45:38,444
My daughter's got a soccer game.

572
00:45:38,644 --> 00:45:40,244
Big one.

573
00:45:41,144 --> 00:45:44,344
Did you see my missile report?
I reset the guidance to blow 10 feet...

574
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:45,744
Bob, you just don't get it.

575
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:50,344
Nobody wants to hear about
a missing missile, not right now.

576
00:45:50,444 --> 00:45:53,144
This is top of the director's list.

577
00:45:53,444 --> 00:45:55,644
Hit a walk-off home run...

578
00:45:56,244 --> 00:45:57,744
...you get any desk you want.

579
00:45:57,844 --> 00:46:02,844
Sheik Hamad has not yet made
a decision about who will succeed him.

580
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:06,344
In our view, Prince Nasir...

581
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:10,244
...is likely the more ambitious
of the two brothers.

582
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:12,144
This, however, does not mean...

583
00:46:12,344 --> 00:46:16,844
...that he will prevail
in any succession struggle.

584
00:46:39,944 --> 00:46:44,444
Your generosity is bigger than a mountain
that shades us from the burning sun.

585
00:46:44,944 --> 00:46:47,744
My house has grown too small
for my family.

586
00:46:47,944 --> 00:46:51,744
If we had more land...

587
00:46:51,944 --> 00:46:54,544
...then my son could build his own house.

588
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:23,044
My father has ordered
the Marbella estate to be razed.

589
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,544
There'll be a park.

590
00:47:30,444 --> 00:47:33,044
We're so sorry for your loss.

591
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:49,744
Six more North Field blocks
are being developed.

592
00:47:50,344 --> 00:47:53,044
We'd like to offer your firm the rights.

593
00:47:54,844 --> 00:47:56,644
Six blocks?

594
00:47:56,744 --> 00:47:59,544
- Which phase?
- Third phase.

595
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:04,044
Okay, so we'd be
in the stream for...

596
00:48:04,244 --> 00:48:06,644
...10 one-hundredths of a cent.

597
00:48:07,944 --> 00:48:10,144
So $ 75 million.

598
00:48:10,344 --> 00:48:12,044
Seventy... Great. That's great.

599
00:48:12,244 --> 00:48:14,244
How much for my other kid?

600
00:48:21,244 --> 00:48:24,344
You know, if I were your economic adviser,
I'd tell you that...

601
00:48:24,544 --> 00:48:27,344
...that's not the stupidest thing,
financially, you've done...

602
00:48:27,544 --> 00:48:31,244
...but probably just the dumbest thing
you'll do today. Probably.

603
00:48:31,444 --> 00:48:33,444
But why would you need
an economic adviser?

604
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:35,744
Years ago, you had
the highest GNP in the world.

605
00:48:35,944 --> 00:48:38,844
Today, you're tied with Albania.
So good work.

606
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:41,644
Your second biggest export
is secondhand goods...

607
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:45,144
...followed closely by dates,
for which you lose 5 cents a pound.

608
00:48:45,344 --> 00:48:47,444
You know what the business world
thinks of you?

609
00:48:47,644 --> 00:48:51,444
We think 100 years ago, you were living
in tents, chopping each other's heads off...

610
00:48:51,644 --> 00:48:54,044
...and that's exactly where you'll be
in another 100.

611
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:57,144
So, yes, on behalf of my firm,
I accept your money. Thank you.

612
00:48:57,344 --> 00:49:00,344
Fine. I'll have the funds
transferred to your firm immediately.

613
00:49:00,544 --> 00:49:01,844
Great.

614
00:49:02,044 --> 00:49:04,344
And I'll give you 100 million
for the other kid.

615
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:10,644
So now you're my economic adviser...

616
00:49:10,744 --> 00:49:14,244
...why don't you tell me something
I don't already know.

617
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:21,044
All right. You want an idea?
Here's an idea.

618
00:49:22,944 --> 00:49:25,044
There's the Eurasian triangle.

619
00:49:25,144 --> 00:49:28,744
Your kingdom is here. Iran is there.
You've been selling your oil...

620
00:49:28,944 --> 00:49:34,744
...sticking it on ships and watching
as it sails away around Africa to there.

621
00:49:34,944 --> 00:49:38,244
Pretend for a second that
this is excess Iranian pipeline capacity.

622
00:49:38,344 --> 00:49:41,544
That's your route. Right there.
Overland, through Iran.

623
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:44,244
Hook up with these pipes.
Commoditize it, control it...

624
00:49:44,344 --> 00:49:46,744
...take it to the doorstep
of every home in Europe.

625
00:49:46,944 --> 00:49:50,744
I just doubled your profit.
I think that's a pretty good idea.

626
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:57,244
777 Ranch
Hondo, Texas

627
00:50:07,644 --> 00:50:10,944
My granddaddy was a wildcatter.
Same with my daddy.

628
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:13,544
That's how I got my start.

629
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,044
Luck and hard work.

630
00:50:16,244 --> 00:50:18,144
Nobody handed me shit.

631
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:20,244
Now I got...

632
00:50:20,444 --> 00:50:24,044
...libraries and parks named after me.

633
00:50:24,444 --> 00:50:28,744
And I'll probably ruin my grandkids.

634
00:50:32,544 --> 00:50:34,244
You wearing a wire, Bennett?

635
00:50:35,444 --> 00:50:36,944
No.

636
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:50,444
Mr. Janus...

637
00:50:50,944 --> 00:50:53,044
...chairman of Connex...

638
00:50:53,944 --> 00:50:57,044
...and Dean Whiting,
founding partner of your firm...

639
00:50:57,444 --> 00:51:01,244
...are proud members of
the Committee to Liberate Iran.

640
00:51:01,344 --> 00:51:03,944
Danny D. here is too.

641
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,244
D is for "Dalton."

642
00:51:06,444 --> 00:51:10,244
- I was on the other side of the Tengiz deal.
- "The other side"?

643
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:14,144
<i>El Presidente Nazarbayev's best pal
in the whole world.</i>

644
00:51:14,344 --> 00:51:16,844
She's a beautiful field, the Tengiz.

645
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:21,344
Goddamn, is she a beautiful field.

646
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:27,744
What is it? "Irish..."

647
00:51:27,944 --> 00:51:29,144
Rockville, Maryland

648
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:32,544
"The Irish pray on their knees,
the Scots prey on their neighbors."

649
00:51:35,244 --> 00:51:37,144
How's Margaret?

650
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,344
You guys divorced yet?

651
00:51:39,544 --> 00:51:42,644
- We're not getting divorced.
- I don't think, in our line of work...

652
00:51:42,844 --> 00:51:47,444
...there's two people with your security
clearances who have made a marriage work.

653
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:49,544
I'm telling you, Bobby, my boy...

654
00:51:49,644 --> 00:51:51,944
...number three. That's the charm.

655
00:51:52,144 --> 00:51:54,444
- That's the number, huh?
- Yeah.

656
00:51:56,044 --> 00:51:58,044
I like consulting.

657
00:51:58,244 --> 00:52:00,244
No, I love it.

658
00:52:00,544 --> 00:52:02,644
Love it. And I'll say this for it:

659
00:52:02,844 --> 00:52:05,844
Private business is efficient.

660
00:52:06,244 --> 00:52:08,044
There, I've said it. Fucking cliché.

661
00:52:08,144 --> 00:52:11,944
And the CIA is, like, what,
a 30-billion-a-year business...

662
00:52:12,144 --> 00:52:15,144
...so anybody who wants to sell anything,
a pencil, a computer...

663
00:52:15,244 --> 00:52:19,244
...they gotta interface through
a security clearance. Don't give me shit.

664
00:52:19,544 --> 00:52:23,544
I got two kids in college,
and we're doing our kitchen.

665
00:52:25,244 --> 00:52:27,544
Stan, I got a chance to go back to Beirut.

666
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,744
I wanna go back.

667
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:32,044
Is it safe for me?

668
00:52:35,344 --> 00:52:38,144
Are we talking about with your wife
or with the wackos?

669
00:52:46,044 --> 00:52:48,144
Clear it with Hezbollah.

670
00:52:58,444 --> 00:53:02,744
Hezbollah-controlled suburb
Beirut, Lebanon

671
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,144
Said Hashimi. Said Hashimi.

672
00:53:44,344 --> 00:53:45,944
Said Hashimi.

673
00:53:46,144 --> 00:53:48,744
I'm Canadian. It's okay. Canadian.

674
00:53:49,044 --> 00:53:50,344
Said Hashimi.

675
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:54,444
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

676
00:53:55,244 --> 00:53:56,544
It's okay.

677
00:54:54,744 --> 00:54:58,644
I have a good feeling
about American people, Bob.

678
00:54:59,044 --> 00:55:00,744
A good people.

679
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:05,044
There are 10 million Muslims
in the U.S.

680
00:55:08,144 --> 00:55:10,244
Thank you for this audience.

681
00:55:10,444 --> 00:55:14,044
I have a business proposal for Mussawi,
one that benefits everyone.

682
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:17,344
Mussawi is an energetic young man.

683
00:55:17,744 --> 00:55:20,544
Your Arabic is very good.

684
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:26,244
I thought it would be prudent to say that
I have no interest in Hezbollah.

685
00:55:26,544 --> 00:55:29,144
This is business
and it doesn't concern Hezbollah.

686
00:55:37,944 --> 00:55:40,644
If what you say is true...

687
00:55:41,444 --> 00:55:44,044
...consider yourself welcome in Lebanon.

688
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:48,844
They can lift 10 times their weight,
and jump 20 times their height.

689
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:50,844
But I still don't understand...

690
00:55:51,044 --> 00:55:54,244
The spider is a symbol
of the sin of man.

691
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:57,444
He bites the finger of Peter Parker...

692
00:55:57,644 --> 00:56:00,344
...who is now half dark and half light.

693
00:56:01,544 --> 00:56:06,944
A real spider captures, stings
and immobilizes...

694
00:56:07,544 --> 00:56:12,244
...then watches
as the prey takes days to die.

695
00:56:14,044 --> 00:56:16,544
They'd never show that.

696
00:56:24,044 --> 00:56:25,044
Are we in trouble?

697
00:56:25,144 --> 00:56:26,444
Peace be upon you, boys.

698
00:56:27,344 --> 00:56:28,644
No, it's not a problem.

699
00:56:30,644 --> 00:56:31,644
Look around you...

700
00:56:32,244 --> 00:56:38,144
...at your brothers united by faith in God
and submission to his law.

701
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:47,444
We're all brothers.

702
00:56:47,644 --> 00:56:49,244
We're one family.

703
00:56:50,544 --> 00:56:51,744
Wasim is still a virgin.

704
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:54,344
That is good.

705
00:56:55,144 --> 00:56:56,944
Fornication is a serious crime.

706
00:57:00,144 --> 00:57:01,144
I'm a virgin too.

707
00:57:01,744 --> 00:57:03,144
That is good as well.

708
00:57:04,044 --> 00:57:05,744
"Abstain from sex out of wedlock.

709
00:57:05,944 --> 00:57:07,644
It is an attack on honor...

710
00:57:07,744 --> 00:57:09,244
...and shows contempt for sanctity."

711
00:57:09,444 --> 00:57:11,044
God has spoken the truth.

712
00:57:13,444 --> 00:57:16,144
Let us pray together.

713
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:48,944
Rumors of Bob, but never Bob.

714
00:57:50,044 --> 00:57:52,244
It is "Bob," right?

715
00:57:54,344 --> 00:57:56,844
What is it you tell people
you do these days, Bob?

716
00:57:56,844 --> 00:58:00,844
Between State Department and Defense.

717
00:58:05,244 --> 00:58:07,544
It's just me, buddy.

718
00:58:07,544 --> 00:58:11,544
As requested.

719
00:58:11,744 --> 00:58:15,744
I'm gonna get
some information out, Jimmy.

720
00:58:16,444 --> 00:58:19,544
- My name is Mussawi.
- Okay, Jimmy.

721
00:58:27,644 --> 00:58:30,444
He's traveling in Beirut.

722
00:58:30,444 --> 00:58:34,444
It's dangerous to travel. He'll disappear.

723
00:58:38,244 --> 00:58:41,744
Take him from his hotel, drug him,
put him in the front of a car...

724
00:58:41,744 --> 00:58:45,744
...and run a truck into him
at 50 miles an hour.

725
00:58:50,244 --> 00:58:53,344
It's good to have you back in town, Bob.

726
00:59:18,244 --> 00:59:21,444
We begin the process of empowering
a new generation of Arabs...

727
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:24,244
Beirut.

728
00:59:24,244 --> 00:59:27,644
No, no. He invited me
to come with him.

729
00:59:28,144 --> 00:59:32,044
I think he thinks he's some kind
of reformer or something.

730
00:59:32,044 --> 00:59:36,044
Anyway, he's got a nice private plane.

731
00:59:36,644 --> 00:59:40,644
Hold on, Vincent.

732
00:59:43,044 --> 00:59:44,844
Hey.

733
00:59:45,244 --> 00:59:48,244
Beirut? It's great. It's like the...

734
00:59:48,244 --> 00:59:51,644
It's like the Paris of the Middle East.

735
00:59:51,644 --> 00:59:54,044
Yeah, it's like... It's like winning the NIT.

736
00:59:54,044 --> 00:59:57,744
- however, unlike Washington's
Greater Middle East Initiative...

737
00:59:57,944 --> 00:59:59,844
It's a bad... Just never mind, never mind.

738
01:00:00,244 --> 01:00:04,244
...we respect each country's right
to move at its own pace.

739
01:00:44,744 --> 01:00:46,244
Make room.

740
01:00:52,444 --> 01:00:54,344
American?

741
01:00:55,244 --> 01:00:57,144
Canadian.

742
01:00:57,144 --> 01:00:59,744
Don't see many Occidentals these days.

743
01:01:11,844 --> 01:01:15,844
It's too bad.

744
01:04:12,845 --> 01:04:16,045
- This is November, '94.
- Yeah. Excellent, excellent.

745
01:04:16,045 --> 01:04:19,045
- Did you find the others?
- I couldn't. Joe's looking for it.

746
01:04:19,045 --> 01:04:21,745
- He'll bring it out when he does.
- Where is he?

747
01:04:21,745 --> 01:04:24,145
He's back there looking.
He'll bring them out.

748
01:04:24,145 --> 01:04:25,945
Okay. Thank you, Susan.

749
01:04:34,845 --> 01:04:36,545
Hello?

750
01:04:36,545 --> 01:04:38,445
Yeah.

751
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:40,045
Who's this?

752
01:04:44,945 --> 01:04:47,445
Yeah. Okay.

753
01:04:52,845 --> 01:04:54,745
How you doing, sir?

754
01:04:54,745 --> 01:04:58,745
Somebody called me.

755
01:05:17,445 --> 01:05:19,245
Bob.

756
01:05:21,145 --> 01:05:23,045
What do you know about
torture methods...

757
01:05:23,145 --> 01:05:25,745
...used by the Chinese
on the Falun Gong?

758
01:05:27,545 --> 01:05:30,045
Method number one.

759
01:05:30,545 --> 01:05:32,545
What's your guess?

760
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:37,245
Water dungeon.

761
01:05:38,645 --> 01:05:40,845
Did you guess water dungeon?

762
01:05:43,545 --> 01:05:45,945
Number two method?

763
01:05:46,645 --> 01:05:50,345
Number two, twisting arm
and putting face in feces.

764
01:05:52,345 --> 01:05:54,645
Not interested in two.

765
01:05:56,645 --> 01:05:58,745
Number three.

766
01:06:00,245 --> 01:06:02,545
Number three is called...

767
01:06:03,445 --> 01:06:06,145
..."pulling nails from fingers."

768
01:06:08,045 --> 01:06:09,945
What do you think, Bob?

769
01:06:10,745 --> 01:06:12,845
Number three sound good to you?

770
01:06:15,045 --> 01:06:19,645
The purpose is to get the monks
or whatever...

771
01:06:19,845 --> 01:06:22,345
...to recant their beliefs.

772
01:06:24,945 --> 01:06:27,545
What if I had to get you to recant?

773
01:06:28,845 --> 01:06:30,745
That'd be pretty difficult, right?

774
01:06:32,145 --> 01:06:33,845
Because...

775
01:06:33,945 --> 01:06:37,945
...if you have no beliefs
to recant, then what?

776
01:06:42,645 --> 01:06:45,045
Well, then, you're fucked is what.

777
01:06:46,945 --> 01:06:48,845
Bob.

778
01:06:51,045 --> 01:06:52,645
You're gonna give me the names...

779
01:06:53,545 --> 01:06:56,045
...of every person
that's taken money from you.

780
01:07:06,645 --> 01:07:08,745
Oh, that is disgusting.

781
01:07:10,745 --> 01:07:13,045
Come on, Jimmy,
you're not a Koran-thumper.

782
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:15,845
My name is Mussawi.

783
01:07:30,145 --> 01:07:33,945
You fucking fuck, fucking fuck,
stupid fuck!

784
01:07:34,145 --> 01:07:36,745
What the fuck? This is a war.

785
01:07:36,945 --> 01:07:41,645
Fuck! You're a PO-fucking-W!
Give me the fucking names!

786
01:07:43,545 --> 01:07:44,745
Fuck it.

787
01:07:46,345 --> 01:07:48,545
I'm cutting his fucking head off.

788
01:07:55,145 --> 01:07:57,645
I'm gonna cut your head off, Bob.

789
01:08:04,445 --> 01:08:07,545
Said Hashimi is very angry with you,
Mussawi.

790
01:08:07,845 --> 01:08:10,745
Said Hashimi keeps his word.

791
01:08:10,945 --> 01:08:13,745
You're a guest of Hezbollah too, Mussawi.

792
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:47,245
I'm going to show you
something really cool.

793
01:09:02,145 --> 01:09:05,445
American-made. Good quality...

794
01:09:06,945 --> 01:09:09,545
...but nearly impossible to hit anything.

795
01:09:14,645 --> 01:09:16,645
By shaping the charge...

796
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:20,945
...this will send a blast
of molten copper...

797
01:09:21,845 --> 01:09:25,645
...through 30 inches of steel.

798
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,845
Careful!

799
01:09:44,845 --> 01:09:46,945
It's very dangerous.

800
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:33,845
Jane.

801
01:10:34,445 --> 01:10:37,445
We've just received a dispatch
from Damascus, eight minutes old.

802
01:10:37,645 --> 01:10:40,245
Mussawi's shopping a story
that we sent Bob to Beirut...

803
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:42,545
...to assassinate Prince Nasir.

804
01:10:47,645 --> 01:10:49,545
We better go talk to Terry.

805
01:10:51,645 --> 01:10:54,745
Can we get this guy?
I mean now, real-time now.

806
01:10:54,845 --> 01:10:57,545
- Mussawi?
- I'll call you back.

807
01:10:57,945 --> 01:11:01,145
The practical answer is no.
Not before he goes into another mosque...

808
01:11:01,245 --> 01:11:03,845
...or a newspaper
and the story gains traction. No.

809
01:11:04,045 --> 01:11:05,345
- He have Bob's name?
- Not his real name.

810
01:11:05,545 --> 01:11:08,245
Mussawi's shopping photos
of them doing the deal, long lens.

811
01:11:08,445 --> 01:11:11,045
Photos of Bob being held.
We're lucky this guy is alive.

812
01:11:11,245 --> 01:11:14,545
The whole contact was a setup.
Mussawi now apparently works with Iran.

813
01:11:14,745 --> 01:11:18,245
First he tortures our guy,
then he peddles the CIA connection.

814
01:11:20,345 --> 01:11:22,745
Put some space between us and Bob.

815
01:11:23,945 --> 01:11:27,045
Bob has a long history
of entrepreneurial operations.

816
01:11:27,145 --> 01:11:29,345
We haven't really had a handle
on Bob for years.

817
01:11:29,545 --> 01:11:33,345
After 9/11, some people got leeway,
let their emotions get the best of them.

818
01:11:33,545 --> 01:11:35,045
These are complex times.

819
01:11:35,145 --> 01:11:39,645
There's already an active investigation
into Bob's activities in... Help me out here.

820
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:42,845
Tehran, the Amiri brothers job.

821
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:45,745
We're finding out who hired Bob
for the Amiri brothers job.

822
01:11:45,945 --> 01:11:48,245
Could the same people
be behind the Nasir job?

823
01:11:48,645 --> 01:11:51,245
A lot of people probably want
this Nasir dead...

824
01:11:51,445 --> 01:11:53,945
...and Bob knows lots of people.
Fill in the rest.

825
01:11:54,145 --> 01:11:55,545
Send me everything.

826
01:12:04,245 --> 01:12:07,545
Walter Reed Hospital
Washington, DC

827
01:12:12,045 --> 01:12:15,145
<i>You first established contact
with the Amiri brothers in 1998?</i>

828
01:12:15,345 --> 01:12:16,545
<i>Yeah.</i>

829
01:12:16,745 --> 01:12:19,045
<i>- You met them at a party in France?
- Yes.</i>

830
01:12:19,245 --> 01:12:21,145
<i>A party given by Reza Reyhani?</i>

831
01:12:21,245 --> 01:12:22,945
<i>Reza, yes.</i>

832
01:12:23,045 --> 01:12:25,245
<i>Were you aware they were
in illegal arms trade?</i>

833
01:12:25,445 --> 01:12:27,345
<i>Of course I was aware.
That's why I went.</i>

834
01:12:27,545 --> 01:12:31,545
<i>Were you aware these two men
were Iranian intelligence officers?</i>

835
01:12:33,345 --> 01:12:36,045
- What do you think?
- This is a diplomatic incident.

836
01:12:36,245 --> 01:12:37,745
Two men have been murdered.

837
01:12:37,945 --> 01:12:40,245
We've been tasked
with the damage assessment.

838
01:12:40,445 --> 01:12:43,245
We'll need you to turn
your passport over to us.

839
01:12:43,445 --> 01:12:44,645
Passports.

840
01:12:54,345 --> 01:12:55,945
Hey.

841
01:12:56,645 --> 01:12:58,445
Hey, I found this.

842
01:12:59,045 --> 01:13:01,045
Wire transfer.

843
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:04,945
In Russian. I don't speak Russian.

844
01:13:05,545 --> 01:13:07,345
Get it translated.

845
01:13:11,745 --> 01:13:13,945
Do you speak Russian?

846
01:13:17,345 --> 01:13:19,645
- These are dead.
- Oh, thanks.

847
01:13:19,845 --> 01:13:21,145
What are these?

848
01:13:22,345 --> 01:13:25,745
Orphans. You know,
things that don't make any sense.

849
01:13:25,845 --> 01:13:27,445
That one's pretty interesting.

850
01:13:27,645 --> 01:13:30,645
The Lily School.
It's a boarding school in Switzerland.

851
01:13:32,145 --> 01:13:33,545
Paid for by wire transfer.

852
01:13:39,945 --> 01:13:42,445
The meeting's already started.
You're not on the list.

853
01:13:42,545 --> 01:13:45,745
This is not an open function.
You're not wearing a badge.

854
01:13:45,945 --> 01:13:47,945
You don't have a wristband.

855
01:13:50,945 --> 01:13:53,745
This is a private gathering.

856
01:13:54,545 --> 01:13:59,245
Take this to Sydney Hewitt.

857
01:14:01,345 --> 01:14:03,745
<i>They are pushing
for the segregation of universities.</i>

858
01:14:03,945 --> 01:14:05,145
Please.

859
01:14:05,345 --> 01:14:08,645
<i>And the banning of the wearing
of colorful clothing.</i>

860
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:13,445
<i>But two-thirds of Iran's population
is under 30.</i>

861
01:14:13,545 --> 01:14:14,845
How you doing?

862
01:14:14,945 --> 01:14:17,445
<i>More than 60 percent
of university students are women.</i>

863
01:14:17,645 --> 01:14:20,445
<i>And those restrictions
are like a small pebble...</i>

864
01:14:20,645 --> 01:14:22,845
<i>... in front of a massive tidal wave
of reform.</i>

865
01:14:24,745 --> 01:14:26,745
<i>Iranian resources are abundant...</i>

866
01:14:26,945 --> 01:14:28,945
<i>... and given the chance,
there is no limit...</i>

867
01:14:29,545 --> 01:14:32,845
<i>... to what the Iranian people can achieve.</i>

868
01:14:33,045 --> 01:14:36,745
<i>Their hopes are the same
as all people in every land...</i>

869
01:14:36,945 --> 01:14:40,645
<i>... to live lives of dignity
in a nation at peace.</i>

870
01:14:40,845 --> 01:14:44,245
<i>And America will help them.</i>

871
01:14:44,445 --> 01:14:47,845
Killen Oil, through Daniel Dalton
and Petroika Energy Consultants...

872
01:14:48,045 --> 01:14:49,845
...created assetless shell companies...

873
01:14:50,045 --> 01:14:52,345
...owned by the heirs
of Nurzan Detayev...

874
01:14:52,545 --> 01:14:55,245
...Republic of Kazakhstan's
minister of Domestic Resources.

875
01:14:55,445 --> 01:14:57,845
This was discussed
at the Upstream Division meeting...

876
01:14:58,045 --> 01:15:00,045
...in January, 2003 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

877
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,745
I was at the meeting,
but I don't focus on those details.

878
01:15:02,945 --> 01:15:06,145
Wherein it was described
that Killen bore all financial risk...

879
01:15:06,345 --> 01:15:11,545
...but Minister Detayev's children, while
attending The Lily School in Switzerland...

880
01:15:11,745 --> 01:15:14,745
...were entitled to all of the profits.
Seventy million dollars.

881
01:15:14,945 --> 01:15:18,545
I attended the meeting, but as I said,
I don't focus on those kind of details.

882
01:15:18,745 --> 01:15:21,945
Further, Daniel Dalton Jr.
and Petroika Energy Consultants colluded...

883
01:15:22,045 --> 01:15:24,945
A firm retained by Killen
prior to Connex's involvement.

884
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:28,345
Oh, for chrissake, Tommy.
We both got letters from the grand jury.

885
01:15:28,545 --> 01:15:32,245
- It's not your own private pity party.
- A good faith purchaser is in good faith...

886
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:35,845
...only if they didn't know of the problems
at the time of the purchase.

887
01:15:36,545 --> 01:15:38,545
This is the oil business
we're talking about?

888
01:15:38,745 --> 01:15:42,645
Lowliest little shareholder knows we deal
with the most stank places on earth.

889
01:15:42,845 --> 01:15:44,845
And it is illegal to offer gifts, money...

890
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:48,645
...the promise of money or anything
of value to influence foreign officials.

891
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:50,045
Is it?

892
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:53,445
I have personally seen a bill
from your law firm...

893
01:15:53,545 --> 01:15:57,245
...to the government of Saudi Arabia
for $36 million.

894
01:15:57,445 --> 01:16:00,745
A one-line bill for "services rendered."

895
01:16:00,945 --> 01:16:04,945
The business of Whiting Sloan
is not under discussion at this time.

896
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:07,845
Well, it ought to be.

897
01:16:09,345 --> 01:16:11,845
Danny's a good man.

898
01:16:12,745 --> 01:16:14,945
And he's a friend of mine.

899
01:16:19,245 --> 01:16:20,745
A Mareva injunction?

900
01:16:20,945 --> 01:16:24,945
Some people, cousins of mine, actually,
sued my father in the Commonwealth...

901
01:16:25,145 --> 01:16:26,445
Geneva, Switzerland

902
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:29,745
...alleging he broke an agreement
to repay funds from the state.

903
01:16:29,945 --> 01:16:33,145
It calls them "aggrieved royals."
Aggrieved about what?

904
01:16:33,245 --> 01:16:37,245
That he tried to cut their allowances
from 100,000 a month to 80?

905
01:16:39,445 --> 01:16:41,045
I want to see my father.

906
01:16:41,745 --> 01:16:42,845
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

907
01:16:43,045 --> 01:16:45,845
Your father is not feeling well.

908
01:16:59,945 --> 01:17:05,245
My cousins aren't bright enough
to be anything but finger puppets...

909
01:17:07,045 --> 01:17:12,145
...and my brother has faith
only in his own cunning.

910
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:21,245
What do you suppose they're up to,
my brother and these American lawyers?

911
01:17:22,545 --> 01:17:24,145
Tell me...

912
01:17:24,845 --> 01:17:26,845
...what are they thinking?

913
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:31,545
What are they thinking?

914
01:17:31,745 --> 01:17:33,945
What are they thinking?

915
01:17:34,045 --> 01:17:36,845
They're thinking that it's running out.

916
01:17:37,045 --> 01:17:39,045
It's running out.

917
01:17:39,145 --> 01:17:42,945
And 90 percent of what's left
is in the Middle East.

918
01:17:43,545 --> 01:17:45,445
Look at the progression.

919
01:17:45,645 --> 01:17:51,945
Versailles, Suez, 1973,
Gulf War One, Gulf War Two.

920
01:17:52,845 --> 01:17:55,145
This is a fight to the death.

921
01:17:55,245 --> 01:17:57,245
So, what are they thinking? "Great."

922
01:17:57,445 --> 01:18:00,345
They're thinking, "Keep playing,
keep buying yourself new toys.

923
01:18:00,445 --> 01:18:03,645
Keep spending $50,000 a night
on your hotel room.

924
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:05,745
But don't invest in your infrastructure.

925
01:18:05,945 --> 01:18:07,445
Don't build a real economy."

926
01:18:07,645 --> 01:18:12,045
So that when you finally wake up,
they will have sucked you dry...

927
01:18:12,245 --> 01:18:15,945
...and you will have squandered
the greatest natural resource in history.

928
01:18:20,545 --> 01:18:22,545
Come with me, please.

929
01:18:26,845 --> 01:18:30,445
I studied at Oxford.
I have a Ph.D. from Georgetown.

930
01:18:30,645 --> 01:18:32,145
I want to create a parliament.

931
01:18:32,245 --> 01:18:34,045
I want to give women the right to vote.

932
01:18:34,245 --> 01:18:36,245
I want an independent judiciary.

933
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:39,045
I want to start a petroleum exchange
in the Middle East...

934
01:18:39,245 --> 01:18:41,545
...cut the speculators
out of the business.

935
01:18:41,745 --> 01:18:45,645
Why are the major oil exchanges
in London and New York anyway?

936
01:18:45,845 --> 01:18:48,545
I'll put all of our energy
up for competitive bidding.

937
01:18:48,745 --> 01:18:51,545
I'll run pipe through Iran to Europe,
like you proposed.

938
01:18:51,745 --> 01:18:53,345
I'll ship to China.

939
01:18:53,545 --> 01:18:56,545
Anything that achieves efficiency
and maximizes profit.

940
01:18:56,645 --> 01:19:00,045
Profit which I will then use
to rebuild my country.

941
01:19:00,145 --> 01:19:02,945
- Great, that's exactly what you should do.
- Exactly.

942
01:19:03,645 --> 01:19:07,645
Except your president
rings my father and says:

943
01:19:07,845 --> 01:19:14,045
"I've got unemployment in Texas,
Kansas, Washington state."

944
01:19:14,245 --> 01:19:17,145
A phone call later, we're stealing
out of our social programs...

945
01:19:17,345 --> 01:19:20,045
...in order to buy overpriced airplanes.

946
01:19:20,845 --> 01:19:24,145
We owed the Americans,
but we've repaid that debt.

947
01:19:24,945 --> 01:19:28,245
I accepted a Chinese bid,
the highest bid...

948
01:19:28,445 --> 01:19:32,445
...and suddenly I'm a terrorist.
I'm a godless communist.

949
01:19:38,845 --> 01:19:40,745
Dean Whiting...

950
01:19:41,445 --> 01:19:44,545
...who represents not only these
aggrieved royals and my brother...

951
01:19:44,745 --> 01:19:46,145
...but also Connex Oil...

952
01:19:46,345 --> 01:19:50,345
...they've been pressuring my father
to invalidate the Chinese contract.

953
01:19:50,745 --> 01:19:52,645
But they underestimate him.

954
01:19:53,445 --> 01:19:56,345
This is about his legacy to his people.

955
01:19:56,745 --> 01:19:59,145
I know it seems like
people sitting in hotel rooms.

956
01:19:59,345 --> 01:20:01,045
That's how they do business.

957
01:20:01,245 --> 01:20:04,445
But we're...
We're talking world historical stage here.

958
01:20:04,645 --> 01:20:08,045
I mean, with the... With the delivery deals
we could make in Europe...

959
01:20:08,245 --> 01:20:09,645
...transport through Iran.

960
01:20:09,745 --> 01:20:13,745
This guy might be able to revolutionize
not just his country, but the whole region.

961
01:20:14,245 --> 01:20:18,645
As soon as his father keels over,
this guy could be like Mossadegh in '52...

962
01:20:18,845 --> 01:20:21,945
...in Iran. The real democracy
rising up organically.

963
01:20:22,445 --> 01:20:24,645
If we can be a part of
any of these countries...

964
01:20:24,745 --> 01:20:28,045
...getting a parliament,
helping them find efficiency, showing...

965
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:31,545
- You know, showing them how...
- Stop it. Stop it.

966
01:20:34,445 --> 01:20:37,245
Julie, the little company
that I started working for...

967
01:20:37,445 --> 01:20:39,945
...is now chief economic adviser
to Prince Nasir.

968
01:20:40,145 --> 01:20:41,745
Do you understand what that means?

969
01:20:41,845 --> 01:20:43,345
It's like...

970
01:20:43,445 --> 01:20:46,745
...somebody put a giant ATM
on our front lawn.

971
01:20:46,845 --> 01:20:48,245
Here's a question:

972
01:20:48,445 --> 01:20:52,145
How do you think it looks to profit
off the death of your 6-year-old?

973
01:20:53,845 --> 01:20:55,445
Fuck you.

974
01:20:55,845 --> 01:20:57,645
Fuck you.

975
01:21:00,745 --> 01:21:03,845
I changed the diapers.
I put cream on rashes.

976
01:21:04,045 --> 01:21:06,145
I took him to his checkups.

977
01:21:06,345 --> 01:21:09,245
I cared about every fucking percentile.

978
01:21:13,145 --> 01:21:15,945
I did everything right.
I did everything right.

979
01:21:22,845 --> 01:21:24,845
We're going back to the States.

980
01:21:25,545 --> 01:21:26,845
Good.

981
01:21:43,845 --> 01:21:45,445
Riley?

982
01:21:46,645 --> 01:21:49,045
Sweetie, sweetie, be careful.

983
01:21:50,445 --> 01:21:52,245
We're gonna go now, okay?

984
01:21:52,445 --> 01:21:54,845
You wanna say goodbye to your dad?

985
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,745
You can see him later, okay?

986
01:22:08,045 --> 01:22:13,245
<i>When I die I want the people who inherit
my possessions to do the following.</i>

987
01:22:13,645 --> 01:22:14,545
<i>One...</i>

988
01:22:14,745 --> 01:22:17,745
<i>... the people who prepare my body
should be good Muslims...</i>

989
01:22:18,545 --> 01:22:22,845
<i>... so this will remind me of God
and his forgiveness.</i>

990
01:22:22,945 --> 01:22:23,945
<i>Two...</i>

991
01:22:24,145 --> 01:22:28,145
<i>... I don't want anyone to rip their clothes
or slap their faces...</i>

992
01:22:28,645 --> 01:22:30,445
<i>... because this is an ignorant thing to do.</i>

993
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:31,845
<i>Three...</i>

994
01:22:32,045 --> 01:22:36,345
<i>... I don't want a pregnant woman to come
and say goodbye to me...</i>

995
01:22:36,445 --> 01:22:38,245
<i>... because I don't approve it.</i>

996
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:40,345
<i>Four...</i>

997
01:22:43,845 --> 01:22:46,845
<i>Some trust-fund prosecutor
got off message at Yale...</i>

998
01:22:46,945 --> 01:22:49,045
<i>... thinks he's gonna run this
up the flagpole?</i>

999
01:22:49,245 --> 01:22:50,645
<i>Make a name for himself?</i>

1000
01:22:50,745 --> 01:22:53,645
<i>Maybe get elected some two-bit
congressman from nowhere...</i>

1001
01:22:53,845 --> 01:22:55,845
<i>... with the result that China or Russia...</i>

1002
01:22:56,045 --> 01:22:58,145
<i>... can suddenly start having,
at our expense...</i>

1003
01:22:58,345 --> 01:23:00,145
<i>... all the advantages we enjoy here?</i>

1004
01:23:00,545 --> 01:23:02,645
No, I tell you. No, sir.

1005
01:23:03,245 --> 01:23:06,045
Corruption charges. Corruption?

1006
01:23:06,345 --> 01:23:08,445
Corruption is government intrusion...

1007
01:23:08,645 --> 01:23:11,345
...into market efficiencies
in the form of regulation.

1008
01:23:11,645 --> 01:23:15,245
That's Milton Friedman.
He got a goddamn Nobel Prize.

1009
01:23:15,445 --> 01:23:18,745
We have laws against it precisely
so we can get away with it.

1010
01:23:18,945 --> 01:23:20,745
Corruption is our protection.

1011
01:23:20,945 --> 01:23:23,145
Corruption keeps us safe and warm!

1012
01:23:23,345 --> 01:23:26,145
Corruption is why you and I are
prancing around in here...

1013
01:23:26,345 --> 01:23:29,345
...instead of fighting over scraps of meat
out in the street.

1014
01:23:29,545 --> 01:23:32,745
Corruption is why we win.

1015
01:23:34,945 --> 01:23:37,045
<i>How'd it go?</i>

1016
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:39,345
Well, he's got kids, a wife.

1017
01:23:39,545 --> 01:23:41,945
He broke the law.

1018
01:23:43,745 --> 01:23:46,445
Mr. Janus himself wanted me
to extend you an invitation...

1019
01:23:46,645 --> 01:23:48,745
...to Oilman of the Year.

1020
01:23:49,145 --> 01:23:50,845
He's being honored...

1021
01:23:51,045 --> 01:23:53,345
...so it should be a nice weekend.

1022
01:23:54,245 --> 01:23:57,645
Relax. Catch yourself a massage.

1023
01:23:57,845 --> 01:23:59,945
Congratulations.

1024
01:24:34,145 --> 01:24:37,345
- Is Jane in?
- She's in a meeting.

1025
01:24:37,445 --> 01:24:38,645
How about Fred?

1026
01:24:38,845 --> 01:24:40,645
He's in a meeting.

1027
01:25:09,645 --> 01:25:10,945
Bennett, hey.

1028
01:25:11,145 --> 01:25:13,945
Come on, take a ride with me.

1029
01:25:14,745 --> 01:25:16,745
Do I have a choice, Don?

1030
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:20,345
Of course you do.
This is just a courtesy call.

1031
01:25:21,345 --> 01:25:25,945
I know you know about the crime-fraud
exception to attorney-client privilege.

1032
01:25:26,145 --> 01:25:27,645
I do, Don. Very well.

1033
01:25:27,745 --> 01:25:31,245
Then you also know your client
is into some shady stuff...

1034
01:25:31,445 --> 01:25:34,045
...and it's starting to look like
you could be involved...

1035
01:25:34,245 --> 01:25:37,445
...in hiding the true nature
of the transactions.

1036
01:25:39,145 --> 01:25:41,245
That's quite a statement, Don.

1037
01:25:46,045 --> 01:25:47,545
One word:

1038
01:25:48,945 --> 01:25:50,345
Dalton.

1039
01:25:52,645 --> 01:25:54,045
Danny Dalton?

1040
01:25:54,245 --> 01:25:57,545
Defrauded the government of Kazakhstan
of funds to which it was entitled.

1041
01:25:57,745 --> 01:26:01,245
Defrauded the people of Kazakhstan
of the right to the honest services...

1042
01:26:01,345 --> 01:26:03,545
...of their elected and appointed officials.

1043
01:26:03,645 --> 01:26:06,145
Seven years. Does three,
maybe two and a half...

1044
01:26:06,345 --> 01:26:08,745
...on your recommendation.
- Now, let me guess.

1045
01:26:08,945 --> 01:26:12,145
This was a solo act, without
the knowledge of Connex or Killen Oil...

1046
01:26:12,345 --> 01:26:15,945
...and Mr. Lee Janus or Jimmy Pope.

1047
01:26:16,145 --> 01:26:17,845
Dalton's a bit of a rogue, it's true.

1048
01:26:18,045 --> 01:26:20,745
And he'll have a nice little trust fund
when he gets out.

1049
01:26:20,945 --> 01:26:23,045
Not so little, I imagine.

1050
01:26:26,045 --> 01:26:28,545
Look, Don, we can spend
the next five years in court...

1051
01:26:28,745 --> 01:26:31,945
...to get back to the very place
that we're at right now.

1052
01:26:33,345 --> 01:26:35,245
And they will fight tough.

1053
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:36,845
They'll fight dirty.

1054
01:26:37,045 --> 01:26:38,345
They'll pressure your boss...

1055
01:26:38,545 --> 01:26:40,545
...the people who appointed your boss...

1056
01:26:40,645 --> 01:26:43,045
...the wives of the people
who appointed your boss.

1057
01:26:43,145 --> 01:26:46,745
And you will never hit them any harder
than this, and you know it.

1058
01:26:50,145 --> 01:26:52,345
I'm sorry, Bennett.

1059
01:26:52,545 --> 01:26:55,345
I don't think Dalton's enough.

1060
01:27:14,745 --> 01:27:16,145
What are you looking at, man?

1061
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:20,345
- I didn't say anything.
- That's because you have nothing to say.

1062
01:27:33,845 --> 01:27:35,845
You fucking asshole.

1063
01:29:00,745 --> 01:29:02,645
There we go.

1064
01:29:03,445 --> 01:29:05,445
Okay, pal.

1065
01:29:06,245 --> 01:29:08,645
Come on. Yeah, I know.
I know, I know, I know.

1066
01:29:08,845 --> 01:29:10,745
- Hey, Fred!
- You've been such a good boy.

1067
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:12,145
Fred.

1068
01:29:12,845 --> 01:29:14,445
Hey, Bob.

1069
01:29:15,545 --> 01:29:18,145
There you go, pal.
I tell you what, Katie, take that in.

1070
01:29:18,245 --> 01:29:20,045
Hey, Jack. Your sister.

1071
01:29:20,645 --> 01:29:22,045
You first.

1072
01:29:27,045 --> 01:29:29,345
Take the kids inside.
I'll be right in, okay?

1073
01:29:30,945 --> 01:29:33,045
What's going on, Fred?

1074
01:29:34,145 --> 01:29:36,345
It's okay. Be in in a sec.

1075
01:29:39,345 --> 01:29:42,145
FBI's got it, Bob. That's pretty clear.

1076
01:29:42,345 --> 01:29:45,145
Nothing I can do, you know it.
It's a criminal investigation.

1077
01:29:45,345 --> 01:29:47,945
- Two men were killed.
- I was almost killed.

1078
01:29:48,045 --> 01:29:52,645
Now they're asking me questions
about the Amiri brothers, about Tehran.

1079
01:29:53,645 --> 01:29:56,945
Understand, this wrecks careers.
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

1080
01:29:57,145 --> 01:30:00,945
I punched in "Prince Nasir Al-Subaai,"
and my computer gets seized.

1081
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:03,945
Where'd that job come from?
Where did the Nasir job come from?

1082
01:30:04,145 --> 01:30:06,045
I'm advising you to drop it.

1083
01:30:06,245 --> 01:30:07,845
Why am I being investigated?

1084
01:30:08,745 --> 01:30:11,545
Why am I being investigated, Fred?

1085
01:30:14,545 --> 01:30:16,345
Goodbye, Bob.

1086
01:30:20,145 --> 01:30:22,745
It's okay. Hey, hey.

1087
01:31:06,445 --> 01:31:07,845
What's up?

1088
01:31:12,745 --> 01:31:15,145
If I truly lack faith...

1089
01:31:16,745 --> 01:31:19,245
...then I am not the right person.

1090
01:31:19,845 --> 01:31:23,645
The questioning means
that you have faith...

1091
01:31:23,745 --> 01:31:25,645
...and makes it stronger.

1092
01:31:26,345 --> 01:31:28,645
That's a lot of shit, I think.

1093
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:34,945
We'll be able to intervene in the
affairs of family members.

1094
01:31:36,345 --> 01:31:38,945
We'll be able to help them with
whatever they need.

1095
01:31:39,545 --> 01:31:42,045
You'll be able to get your mother here.

1096
01:32:11,445 --> 01:32:12,845
Please.

1097
01:32:17,845 --> 01:32:19,645
I am tired.

1098
01:32:20,045 --> 01:32:21,345
Father...

1099
01:32:23,045 --> 01:32:24,945
...who will be emir?

1100
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:32,045
Your brother.

1101
01:32:32,145 --> 01:32:33,545
Praise be to God.

1102
01:32:34,045 --> 01:32:37,245
I would ask you to remain
as foreign minister.

1103
01:32:37,345 --> 01:32:39,745
You cannot do this.

1104
01:32:41,045 --> 01:32:45,045
He is barely qualified to run a brothel,
much less a country.

1105
01:32:48,445 --> 01:32:50,745
I like Europe.

1106
01:32:51,945 --> 01:32:54,545
I will be happy to stay here.

1107
01:32:57,145 --> 01:32:59,245
My decision is final...

1108
01:32:59,445 --> 01:33:03,045
...and I ask you to support your brother.

1109
01:33:04,145 --> 01:33:06,745
I cannot do that.

1110
01:33:19,445 --> 01:33:25,245
For centuries Arabs have been ruled by
people with no respect for law...

1111
01:33:26,145 --> 01:33:29,245
...monopolies handed out for the
things that people want...

1112
01:33:29,645 --> 01:33:33,645
...commerce stifled, young people
unable to find jobs.

1113
01:33:34,345 --> 01:33:38,345
Anyone who criticizes is thrown in jail...

1114
01:33:39,145 --> 01:33:41,545
...or put to death.

1115
01:33:42,145 --> 01:33:43,945
And women...

1116
01:33:44,345 --> 01:33:48,045
...are treated as second-class citizens.

1117
01:33:48,245 --> 01:33:52,745
The coronation is tomorrow, and your
brother has the support of the Americans.

1118
01:33:53,045 --> 01:33:57,045
And 10,000 of their troops
are stationed in our country.

1119
01:34:00,145 --> 01:34:01,545
True.

1120
01:34:02,845 --> 01:34:06,445
My father is ill and weak, and unwilling
to oppose the Americans.

1121
01:34:08,545 --> 01:34:11,145
But others are willing.

1122
01:34:11,645 --> 01:34:15,145
When a country has 5 percent
of the world's population...

1123
01:34:15,345 --> 01:34:20,045
...but does 50 percent
of its military spending...

1124
01:34:21,445 --> 01:34:27,345
...then the persuasive powers of that
country are on the decline.

1125
01:34:36,245 --> 01:34:38,045
<i>They're worried.</i>

1126
01:34:38,745 --> 01:34:41,345
<i>About fallout. They're worried...</i>

1127
01:34:42,845 --> 01:34:44,445
...you might wanna talk about it.

1128
01:34:47,345 --> 01:34:50,345
But if you're already
under investigation...

1129
01:34:53,545 --> 01:34:55,545
What about Mussawi?

1130
01:34:56,245 --> 01:34:58,245
He's a soldier.

1131
01:35:00,845 --> 01:35:02,745
He's just like you.

1132
01:35:06,845 --> 01:35:12,445
Why are they doing a damage assessment
on the Amiris and on me for doing my job?

1133
01:35:13,645 --> 01:35:17,645
This is about our interests in the region.

1134
01:35:19,445 --> 01:35:25,245
So if Prince Nasir won't allow
our military bases in his country...

1135
01:35:25,445 --> 01:35:28,145
...and his little brother will...

1136
01:35:30,045 --> 01:35:32,945
...well, we'll probably have to
do something about that.

1137
01:35:34,845 --> 01:35:37,645
Who's worried about the Nasir job?

1138
01:35:39,445 --> 01:35:42,445
Who's worried about me talking?

1139
01:35:45,745 --> 01:35:47,145
Stan.

1140
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:52,845
Who's worried?

1141
01:36:07,045 --> 01:36:08,245
Hello?

1142
01:36:08,445 --> 01:36:10,645
<i>Hello, is this Mr. Whitting?</i>

1143
01:36:11,145 --> 01:36:13,445
<i>This is Homeseal Security.</i>

1144
01:36:14,745 --> 01:36:16,745
Yes, this is Mr. Whiting.

1145
01:36:16,845 --> 01:36:21,445
<i>Hi, we're showing a motion-sensor failure
in your downstairs study.</i>

1146
01:36:21,645 --> 01:36:22,845
Yes?

1147
01:36:23,045 --> 01:36:25,545
<i>Like I said, we're getting
a failure message.</i>

1148
01:36:25,645 --> 01:36:28,745
<i>Want me to stay on the phone
while you walk around, or send a car?</i>

1149
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:42,345
I'll walk around.

1150
01:37:01,745 --> 01:37:04,045
Everything seems fine.

1151
01:37:11,645 --> 01:37:13,145
<i>How are we doing, Mr. Whiting?</i>

1152
01:37:13,345 --> 01:37:15,345
Everything's fine.

1153
01:37:29,245 --> 01:37:32,045
<i>- The door's unlocked.
- Did you leave it unlocked?</i>

1154
01:37:32,245 --> 01:37:35,245
Send a car, you imbecile.

1155
01:38:09,245 --> 01:38:12,045
You were in Beirut in '84.

1156
01:38:14,945 --> 01:38:17,045
I lost friends there...

1157
01:38:17,445 --> 01:38:19,945
...as I'm sure you did.

1158
01:38:23,045 --> 01:38:26,245
I got a peek at your file.
You're a good man.

1159
01:38:26,445 --> 01:38:31,245
One whose experience
is narrow and deep.

1160
01:38:31,445 --> 01:38:33,545
Your entire career...

1161
01:38:33,645 --> 01:38:35,545
...you've been used.

1162
01:38:36,245 --> 01:38:40,145
And probably never even known
what for.

1163
01:38:40,345 --> 01:38:43,145
I didn't use to need to know.

1164
01:38:44,345 --> 01:38:47,945
In this town, you're innocent
until you're investigated.

1165
01:38:50,445 --> 01:38:54,345
Innocent until investigated? That's nice.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1166
01:38:56,645 --> 01:38:59,345
I bet you've worn some miles
on little sayings like that.

1167
01:38:59,545 --> 01:39:01,245
Thank you.

1168
01:39:01,545 --> 01:39:03,345
- Thank you.
- No.

1169
01:39:03,945 --> 01:39:07,945
Gives the listener the sense of the law
being written as it's spoken.

1170
01:39:13,745 --> 01:39:16,545
If anything happens to me or my family...

1171
01:39:16,745 --> 01:39:19,845
...an accident, an accusation, anything...

1172
01:39:20,745 --> 01:39:23,545
...then, first, your son will disappear.

1173
01:39:23,645 --> 01:39:26,645
His body will never be found.
Then your wife.

1174
01:39:27,245 --> 01:39:31,145
Her body will never be found either.
Now, this is guaranteed.

1175
01:39:31,545 --> 01:39:34,345
Then whatever is the most dangerous
thing that you do...

1176
01:39:34,445 --> 01:39:36,645
...it might be flying in a small plane...

1177
01:39:37,245 --> 01:39:39,145
...might be walking to the bank...

1178
01:39:39,345 --> 01:39:41,145
...you'll be killed.

1179
01:39:43,245 --> 01:39:45,345
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1180
01:39:47,045 --> 01:39:49,445
I want you to acknowledge
that you do understand...

1181
01:39:49,545 --> 01:39:53,045
...so that we're clear
and there won't be any mistakes.

1182
01:39:55,045 --> 01:39:58,145
Beirut rules, Mr. Barnes?

1183
01:40:03,745 --> 01:40:06,145
I want my passports back.

1184
01:40:41,945 --> 01:40:43,845
We are a small group...

1185
01:40:44,445 --> 01:40:48,445
...the ones who carry convictions
and ambitions.

1186
01:40:50,045 --> 01:40:51,845
And within this group...

1187
01:40:52,245 --> 01:40:54,545
...there is another, smaller group...

1188
01:40:55,145 --> 01:40:57,845
...who flee from the worldly life...

1189
01:40:58,545 --> 01:41:01,245
...in order to spread the true faith.

1190
01:41:03,045 --> 01:41:05,345
You're ready.

1191
01:41:12,345 --> 01:41:18,445
<i>Connex-Killen Oil announces the gift
of a new children's hospital...</i>

1192
01:41:18,545 --> 01:41:21,045
<i>... to be built in honor of the new emir.</i>

1193
01:41:21,545 --> 01:41:24,245
I wanted to be on a bobsled
in the Olympics.

1194
01:41:24,445 --> 01:41:25,545
What's a bobsled?

1195
01:41:29,945 --> 01:41:32,245
Wasim knows what a bobsled is.

1196
01:41:32,345 --> 01:41:33,645
Papa, I need to ask you...

1197
01:41:33,745 --> 01:41:35,745
Tell him about the bobsled!

1198
01:41:38,845 --> 01:41:40,845
Tell him what a bobsled is.

1199
01:41:42,145 --> 01:41:43,645
It's a little car.

1200
01:41:43,845 --> 01:41:46,245
A little car that goes down a track
of ice and snow.

1201
01:41:46,345 --> 01:41:48,845
Papa, may I borrow some money
for the bus?

1202
01:41:49,745 --> 01:41:53,745
Oh, how the snow sparkles,
the crunch of it under your feet...

1203
01:42:22,345 --> 01:42:24,645
Dalton's not enough.

1204
01:42:25,745 --> 01:42:27,945
I would be real careful.

1205
01:42:28,845 --> 01:42:32,445
You dig a 6-foot hole,
you'll find three bodies.

1206
01:42:32,645 --> 01:42:35,245
But you dig 12, and maybe you'll find 40.

1207
01:42:38,245 --> 01:42:40,645
China's economy ain't growing
as fast as it could...

1208
01:42:40,845 --> 01:42:43,145
...because they can't get
all the oil they need.

1209
01:42:43,245 --> 01:42:45,745
Now, I'm damn proud of that fact.

1210
01:42:47,445 --> 01:42:49,945
We need another body, Mr. Pope.

1211
01:42:55,345 --> 01:42:57,245
What if...?

1212
01:42:57,945 --> 01:43:00,945
What if it involved somebody
at your firm?

1213
01:43:01,645 --> 01:43:04,445
Someone way the hell above you.

1214
01:43:07,745 --> 01:43:11,345
We'd have to have an understanding.

1215
01:43:18,545 --> 01:43:20,445
Well...

1216
01:43:22,245 --> 01:43:23,945
...if...

1217
01:43:24,745 --> 01:43:27,145
If he's as big as you say...

1218
01:43:27,345 --> 01:43:31,345
...then when he goes down,
the merger will be approved.

1219
01:43:32,845 --> 01:43:34,445
Just like that?

1220
01:43:37,945 --> 01:43:41,545
We're looking for the illusion
of due diligence, Mr. Pope.

1221
01:43:42,045 --> 01:43:45,045
Two criminal acts
successfully prosecuted...

1222
01:43:45,145 --> 01:43:47,345
...it gives us that illusion.

1223
01:43:54,445 --> 01:43:56,545
Call me Jimmy.

1224
01:44:48,345 --> 01:44:53,245
He's a visionary. He's like Faisal or Atatürk.
The people love him. And he's...

1225
01:44:53,445 --> 01:44:55,545
The country's gonna be his by Monday.

1226
01:44:56,945 --> 01:44:59,545
It's not like you guys have backed
the wrong horse here.

1227
01:45:13,445 --> 01:45:15,645
No, no. No, look,
he's got nine of 11 generals.

1228
01:45:16,145 --> 01:45:19,745
We're on our way to the palace right now.
This is really happening.

1229
01:45:25,445 --> 01:45:26,745
Silver Range Rover.

1230
01:45:27,045 --> 01:45:28,345
<i>With a sunroof.</i>

1231
01:45:28,445 --> 01:45:31,745
Silver Range Rover, sunroof,
fourth from lead.

1232
01:45:33,245 --> 01:45:35,545
- Guys, help me out here.
- It's coming now.

1233
01:46:00,845 --> 01:46:03,245
His wife will be there. Pat.

1234
01:46:07,145 --> 01:46:08,945
This is good.

1235
01:46:10,045 --> 01:46:11,745
You done good.

1236
01:46:18,345 --> 01:46:20,445
Lee, you have guests.

1237
01:46:23,945 --> 01:46:26,045
- Syd.
- Leland.

1238
01:46:26,745 --> 01:46:28,345
- Bennett Holiday.
- How are you, sir?

1239
01:46:28,445 --> 01:46:30,645
- Lee Janus. How are we doing?
- Well.

1240
01:46:30,845 --> 01:46:34,845
Those number crunchers can get
a little overzealous, can't they?

1241
01:46:36,745 --> 01:46:42,645
Christ, when we write the GAAP rules
like some sort of abstract painting...

1242
01:46:43,045 --> 01:46:46,045
...you stare at that liability
hard enough...

1243
01:46:46,245 --> 01:46:49,245
...and before long, it'll turn into an asset.

1244
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:50,845
No, thank you.

1245
01:46:53,745 --> 01:46:56,445
- You don't drink?
- No.

1246
01:47:02,745 --> 01:47:05,745
It is really beautiful out here.

1247
01:47:16,245 --> 01:47:18,845
- What is that?
- What?

1248
01:47:19,045 --> 01:47:20,745
In front of them.

1249
01:47:52,545 --> 01:47:55,045
The Bedouin always have right of way.

1250
01:47:56,545 --> 01:47:59,045
Lawyers say, "If you can't trust
a Big Five accounting firm..."

1251
01:47:59,245 --> 01:48:01,145
The accountants say,
"We're not lawyers."

1252
01:48:01,445 --> 01:48:04,045
Legal didn't understand.
Accounting didn't understand.

1253
01:48:04,145 --> 01:48:07,645
Nobody understood anything.
Regulatory bodies scratched their heads...

1254
01:48:07,745 --> 01:48:09,945
...that nobody at Connex or Killen
was at fault.

1255
01:48:10,145 --> 01:48:13,345
But this merger is so balance-positive
for American consumers...

1256
01:48:13,545 --> 01:48:15,445
...that, ultimately, Justice wants it.

1257
01:48:15,545 --> 01:48:18,945
Federal courts want it.
Everybody wants it.

1258
01:48:19,145 --> 01:48:23,145
Our real client, after all,
is us, the American people.

1259
01:48:23,445 --> 01:48:28,045
And we are increasing American access
to oil in Kazakhstan.

1260
01:48:28,245 --> 01:48:31,745
So all they ask is that we give them
a little something meaningful...

1261
01:48:31,845 --> 01:48:33,445
...which we did.

1262
01:48:33,645 --> 01:48:35,745
And they got out of our way.

1263
01:48:36,445 --> 01:48:39,245
Something besides Dalton?

1264
01:48:39,445 --> 01:48:41,645
Unfortunately, yes.

1265
01:48:42,145 --> 01:48:44,745
And the best option seemed to be...

1266
01:48:45,645 --> 01:48:48,545
...a secret deal for excess
Iranian pipeline capacity...

1267
01:48:48,745 --> 01:48:51,145
...that I uncovered during the diligence.

1268
01:48:51,345 --> 01:48:53,545
A little side deal benefiting
the lead lawyer...

1269
01:48:53,745 --> 01:48:56,345
...involved in the Connex-Killen
merger approval process.

1270
01:48:56,545 --> 01:48:58,045
What...

1271
01:48:58,145 --> 01:48:59,645
...do you think you're doing?

1272
01:48:59,845 --> 01:49:02,645
It's illegal for an American
to control these rights.

1273
01:49:02,845 --> 01:49:04,745
Stop right now.

1274
01:49:07,345 --> 01:49:09,245
Is there...

1275
01:49:10,045 --> 01:49:13,545
...something that
you wanna tell me, Syd?

1276
01:49:23,845 --> 01:49:28,345
Connex/ Al-Salwa LNG loading facility
The Persian Gulf

1277
01:49:35,545 --> 01:49:36,845
Good afternoon.

1278
01:49:37,045 --> 01:49:39,645
I wanna thank our host
for a wonderful spread.

1279
01:49:39,845 --> 01:49:42,245
The strawberry juice is delicious.

1280
01:49:45,145 --> 01:49:48,345
Let me just say,
on behalf of Connex-Killen...

1281
01:49:48,445 --> 01:49:51,645
...how pleased we are
to be back in the Gulf.

1282
01:51:10,945 --> 01:51:14,645
Your Highness?
Why don't you ride together.

1283
01:51:16,045 --> 01:51:18,045
Oh, thank you, Bryan.

1284
01:51:41,645 --> 01:51:43,445
Ladies and gentlemen...

1285
01:51:43,645 --> 01:51:46,945
...this year's Oilman of the Year:

1286
01:51:47,045 --> 01:51:51,845
Mr. Leland Janus of Connex-Killen.

1287
01:52:36,645 --> 01:52:38,845
Who the hell is that?

1288
01:52:52,445 --> 01:52:55,145
Excuse me. Hey, are you seeing that?

1289
01:52:58,445 --> 01:52:59,845
Hey!

1290
01:53:00,645 --> 01:53:01,945
Hey!

1291
01:53:10,445 --> 01:53:12,045
Could you tell who that is?

1292
01:53:17,145 --> 01:53:19,545
Hey! Hey!

1293
01:53:19,745 --> 01:53:21,745
No, no, no! No!

1294
01:54:06,945 --> 01:54:09,745
- Take the target out.
- Roger.

1295
01:54:15,545 --> 01:54:17,045
Four miles.

1296
01:54:27,645 --> 01:54:29,245
Two miles.

1297
01:54:45,445 --> 01:54:46,945
You're the Canadian.

1298
01:54:54,245 --> 01:54:55,645
Target destroyed.

1299
01:54:57,445 --> 01:54:59,445
23:44 EDT.

1300
01:55:14,445 --> 01:55:17,845
I'd like to accept this award...

1301
01:55:17,845 --> 01:55:23,345
...on behalf of the employees
of Connex-Killen.

1302
01:55:23,445 --> 01:55:27,445
Our people, the finest in the world.

1303
01:55:28,345 --> 01:55:32,645
Guys, could I get you to stand up
for a moment? Please stand up.

1304
01:55:32,845 --> 01:55:36,845
Connex-Killen.

1305
01:56:15,345 --> 01:56:17,445
And I'd also like to thank...

1306
01:56:17,545 --> 01:56:20,145
...our strategic friends from
around the globe who are here tonight.

1307
01:56:21,345 --> 01:56:24,045
Most especially...

1308
01:56:24,045 --> 01:56:26,745
...Emir Meshal Al-Subaai.

1309
01:56:26,845 --> 01:56:30,845
Emir. Thank you so much.

1310
02:01:00,645 --> 02:01:04,645
Come on, man.

1311
02:01:04,845 --> 02:01:08,845
Leave the beer.
