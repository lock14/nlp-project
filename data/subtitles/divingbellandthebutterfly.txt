1
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,656
The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

2
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:17,887
Look! He's waking.
- Dr. Cocheton, come to room 119.

3
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:19,967
Dr. Cocheton to room 119, please.

4
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:23,018
No, no, Jean-Dominique,
open your eyes.

5
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:24,607
Keep your eyes open.

6
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:27,346
Mr Bauby, keep your eyes open.

7
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:32,487
You've been asleep for a long time.
Can you hear me?

8
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,587
<i>I hear you.</i>

9
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:40,337
<i>What is happening...?</i>

10
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,872
<i>Jesus. I'm in a hospital.</i>

11
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:48,021
Mr Bauby, keep your eyes open.

12
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:53,057
Try to keep them open, please.

13
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:57,219
Good man.
Follow the light with your eyes.

14
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:05,387
Great.

15
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:09,942
Don't be alarmed.
You're in a hospital.

16
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:15,819
I'm a doctor. My name's Cocheton.
These are nurses.

17
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:19,382
We're here to take care of you.

18
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,617
Do you remember what happened?

19
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,767
Do You remember
what happened?

20
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:30,576
<i>I said. Vaguely.</i>

21
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:39,305
You're in the Naval
Hospital, Berck-sur-Mer.

22
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:41,487
On the coast. In Calais.

23
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:44,627
You were treated first
in Paris, and then...

24
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:45,727
brought here.

25
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:48,887
Do you remember that?
- <i>Not really.</i>

26
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:51,557
You see, Jean-Dominique...

27
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:53,727
you've had a stroke.

28
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:56,927
You've been in a coma for almost 
three weeks.

29
00:03:57,027 --> 00:04:00,682
But now you're waking up and
you'll be fine.

30
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,067
I promise you.

31
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:05,907
<i>Thanks</i>

32
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:08,927
I'm just going to give
you a few simple tests.

33
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:11,727
I want you to keep
your eyes on me.

34
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,827
Good. You understand.

35
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:18,464
<i>Yes, Yes.</i>

36
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:28,256
When I say blink, please blink.

37
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:35,387
Excellent.

38
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,376
Now, tell me your name.

39
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:42,480
<i>Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

40
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,767
Come on, try hard, say your name.

41
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,462
<i>I did.</i>
- Try saying your name.

42
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,847
<i>Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

43
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:53,701
Try saying your children's names.

44
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:58,618
<i>Théophile, Céleste, Hortense.</i>

45
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,822
All right, don't worry.

46
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:08,498
It's a slow process.
Your speech will come back.

47
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:13,303
<i>What? Can't you hear me, 
Doctor? Doctor?</i>

48
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:16,658
<i>Oh, Christ. I can't speak.</i>

49
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,984
<i>They can't hear me.</i>

50
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,087
<i>I can't speak.</i>

51
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:25,382
<i>What's happened to me?</i>

52
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:30,020
<i>My name is
Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

53
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:32,227
<i>Doctor?</i>

54
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,067
<i>It's okay, okay.</i>

55
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:37,497
<i>All right, I've had a
stroke - my speech...</i>

56
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,407
<i>will come back. My
memory will come back</i>

57
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:43,767
It will take some time, Mr Bauby.
We will take care of you.

58
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,867
<i>I'll be patient</i>

59
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:49,187
<i>Okay...</i>

60
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,507
<i>I believe you.</i>

61
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:05,586
<i>Who brought the flowers?</i>

62
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,067
<i>Roses.</i>

63
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:13,423
<i>Click, click...</i>

64
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,987
<i>Inès.</i>

65
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:40,697
How did you sleep?

66
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:44,947
Now let's see...

67
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:58,689
This morning you have
an important visitor.

68
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,607
Dr. Lepage, your neurologist...

69
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:03,087
so we want you at your best.

70
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:21,445
<i>If I could only be that frog.</i>

71
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:34,672
Hello. My name is Alain Lepage, 
I'm your neurologist.

72
00:07:34,772 --> 00:07:35,567
You know Dr. Cocheton.

73
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,387
Jean-Dominique... No.
Your friends call...

74
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:38,487
you Jean-Do...

75
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:40,069
so that is how I will address you.

76
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,967
I want you to think
of me as your friend,

77
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,607
<i>Just be my doctor.</i>

78
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:48,223
Jean-Do, 
I know how difficult this is for you.

79
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,764
No one has told you the extent of...

80
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:56,689
your condition. That is
my job...yes, my job.

81
00:07:56,827 --> 00:08:01,696
You've had what we call a 
cerebrovascular accident.

82
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,647
It has put your brain
stem out of action.

83
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:09,233
The brain stem is an
essential component...

84
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,628
of our internal computer...

85
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:14,367
the link between the
brain and the spinal cord.

86
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:17,474
In the past, we would have
said you suffered ...

87
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:20,007
a massive near-fatal stroke.

88
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:26,080
But now with some improved techniques...

89
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,082
we're able to prolong life.

90
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,307
<i>Is this life? Is this life?</i>

91
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:34,381
Yes, prolong life.

92
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,762
I'm not going to mince words.

93
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:42,837
You are paralyzed
from head to toe.

94
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:46,592
And, as you now
must have realized,

95
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,732
you are unable to speak.

96
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:54,687
The name for your condition
is...

97
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,777
'locked-in syndrome'.

98
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,218
<i>'locked-in syndrome'.</i>

99
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:11,607
It will be of no comfort to you but
your condition is extremely rare.

100
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:14,527
And we simply don't know the 
cause of it.

101
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:17,087
You do not smoke, you
drink with moderation...

102
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:19,927
So, I'm afraid it's just
without explanation.

103
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:25,499
However, apart from being
totally paralyzed...

104
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:28,607
we believe you are normal
in every other respect.

105
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:31,257
<i>Normal?</i>
- So there is hope.

106
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:35,292
We know you have
good brain function.

107
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:36,886
You're able to understand us.

108
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:39,127
You follow our movements
with your eyes.

109
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:42,627
But I'm not content
with your right eye.

110
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,659
That muscle isn't working well.

111
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:51,546
And there is no irrigation.

112
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,504
We may need to cover it ...or not.

113
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:58,707
<i>Cover it?</i>

114
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:02,857
<i>What is covered?</i>

115
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,946
I may need a second
opinion on that...

116
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:09,881
We want you to take it
easy for a few days.

117
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:11,804
<i>What do you think I'm doing now?</i>

118
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,487
Very soon two beautiful
women will visit you.

119
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:17,835
I envy you because
when I say beautiful,

120
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,287
I mean beautiful.

121
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:24,415
They're therapists and
they're miracle workers.

122
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:28,859
And so, as I say, there's hope.

123
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:31,487
<i>You already said that.</i>

124
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:34,181
I'll come again, soon.

125
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:38,245
<i>How nice. Leave.</i>
You will be well looked after.

126
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:43,933
<i>Oh Christ. 
Noirtier de Villefort...</i>

127
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:31,227
Hello.

128
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:36,760
Hello.

129
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:39,987
<i>I'm dead and I've gone to heaven.</i>

130
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:40,887
I'm Henriette.

131
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:42,127
I'm Marie.

132
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:45,127
I'm told you can blink your eyes.

133
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:49,222
I want you to blink once for yes, 
twice for no.

134
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:54,407
<i>What luck. I've got these two 
by my bed and I'm helpless.</i>

135
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:56,887
Can you read what this says?

136
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,127
Good.
- <i> Are you married?</i>

137
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:05,887
I'm the Physical Therapist, and my
job is to get you to swallow.

138
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:09,387
I'll be working on
your tongue and lips.

139
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:12,047
<i>Sounds fun.</i>
- And I'm the Speech Therapist...

140
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:14,785
We need to find a way for you
to communicate...

141
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:17,127
until you can speak again.

142
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:20,039
Honestly, We have never treated 
this condition.

143
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:20,867
<i>Great.</i>

144
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:24,447
There will be much work.
- So, we won't waste time.

145
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:29,063
I just came to introduce
myself. See you later.

146
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:32,307
<i>See you later.</i>

147
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,267
Jean-Do, I want you to know...

148
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:47,807
this is the most important job I've 
ever undertaken.

149
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:51,087
And I'm determined to succeed.

150
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,187
With your help, of course.

151
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:59,657
We're going to start by asking
some more questions.

152
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,847
Okay?

153
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,378
Remember, you answer by blinking,
once for yes...

154
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:07,478
or twice for no.

155
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:11,547
Am I a man?

156
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,907
Am I a woman?

157
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,307
Is the sun too bright for you?

158
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,987
Is it midnight now?

159
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:26,812
<i>Strange questions.</i>
- Are we in Paris?

160
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,907
Are we in Berck?

161
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:34,503
Does wood float on water?
- <i>What do you think.</i>

162
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,492
do you remember having your stroke?

163
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,906
Were you the editor of Elle magazine?

164
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:45,664
<i>I was the editor-in-chief of Elle magazine.</i>

165
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,767
Your right eye isn't working properly.

166
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,867
Did you hear me?

167
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:32,452
Your right eye isn't working.
I have to sew it up.

168
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:35,492
<i>Sew it up?</i>
- It will be alright.

169
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:39,847
It will prevent an ulcerated cornea.

170
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,899
I would have been here sooner,
but I've been skiing.

171
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,999
St. Moritz is wonderful this time of year.

172
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,347
<i>You fool.</i>

173
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:52,087
There is nothing like sailing down
a slope with the wind in your face.

174
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:53,847
<i>Don't come near me.</i>

175
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:56,412
<i>Don't touch me.</i>

176
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:59,567
<i>Please, no.</i>

177
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:04,007
<i>No, Doctor. Please.</i>

178
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:09,261
<i>No, please don't . God, please. 
Don't do it.</i>

179
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:13,202
I have done it a thousand times.

180
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,527
Don't worry.

181
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:30,381
I am almost done.  Almost...

182
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:34,375
Very good.

183
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,067
There. Finished.

184
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:47,527
We're here to dress you.
Good for the morale.

185
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:48,942
Then we have a surprise.

186
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:20,252
Good. Now try him in the wheelchair.

187
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:26,387
Great.

188
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,424
Wheel him around, will you?

189
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,524
Turn.

190
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:37,547
I want to be sure that sitting like that...

191
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:40,607
won't trigger uncontrolled muscular spasms.

192
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:42,127
Understand?
- Yes.

193
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:46,347
He needs a cushion for his head.
- Sorry bear with us.

194
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:48,699
Excellent, excellent.

195
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:52,047
You can handle the wheelchair.

196
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:55,256
<i>Excellent? This sounds like a 
life sentence.</i>

197
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,907
And now for the surprise.

198
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:13,685
<i>Oh my God, who's that?</i>

199
00:17:13,827 --> 00:17:14,885
<i>Is it me?</i>

200
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,860
<i>I look as if I was submerged...</i>

201
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
<i>in a vat of formaldehyde.</i> 

202
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:24,147
<i>How terrible.</i>

203
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:28,384
<i>Is this my surprise? 
To see myself</i>

204
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:43,947
<i>Céline.</i>

205
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:54,377
How are you? I better explain.

206
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,607
Isn't this a wonderful surprise, Jean-Do?
Your first visitor. Your wife.

207
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:03,217
<i>She's not my wife. She's the 
mother of my children.</i>

208
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,703
He understands everything. Everything.

209
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:10,621
If you ask a question, make it a 
yes-or-no question.

210
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:14,887
He'll blink. Once for yes, twice for no.

211
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:20,049
It is important to speak to him...

212
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:22,497
here in front of him. Okay?

213
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:26,727
If you stand here, he can't see you...
or over here.

214
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:30,007
Speak to him here. 
Yes,Jean-Do?

215
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:34,627
I'll go. I'm sure you have a lot to 
say to each other.

216
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:56,175
They say that you're...

217
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:03,107
Everyone prays for you and 
hopes the bests for you.

218
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:07,242
I didn't bring the children.

219
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,267
I wanted to see you first.

220
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,242
The children are okay.
They miss you.

221
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:17,027
Céleste prays every evening for you.

222
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,987
Do you want me to bring them?

223
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:26,627
You don't want to see them.

224
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,667
Laurent wants to visit.
Do you want to see him?

225
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:41,307
Him? You want to see him.

226
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,427
I'll tell him.

227
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:08,072
Has she already visited you?

228
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,772
I've met the speech therapist.
I like her.

229
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:22,057
She thinks that she can help you.

230
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:32,618
I beg you...

231
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:35,318
Please, don't cry.

232
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:43,014
<i>I know Berck station.</i>

233
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:45,847
<i>I can see it now.</i>

234
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:48,487
<i>It's the most depressing place 
in the world.</i>

235
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:53,087
<i>It certainly was when I had
holidays here as a boy.</i>

236
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:55,907
<i>The end of summer.</i>

237
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:59,087
<i>Waiting for the train to Paris 
with my father.</i>

238
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:04,202
<i>It was desolate then... 
and must feel more desolate now.</i>

239
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:09,397
<i>I have treated her so badly. 
And the children too.</i>

240
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:15,386
<i>And now I can never make up for it.</i>

241
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,847
<i>Not at all.</i>

242
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:20,947
Look at this.

243
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:26,143
This is not the alphabet 
you learned in school.

244
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:31,507
The letters are listed in the order 
of the frequency of their use. Understand?

245
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:36,343
E, S, A, R, I, N, T,U,L,
O,M,D,P,C,F....

246
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:39,342
<i>Frequency of use?</i>

247
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:48,647
I have done research, and
discussed it with my colleagues...

248
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:51,047
in the hope we can create
a working system.

249
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:54,207
<i>Good for you.</i>
- This is how it works...

250
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:58,152
Think of  what you wish to say.
then use blinks.

251
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:03,184
I will read out the letters slowly one by one.

252
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:06,527
When I say your first letter, blink.

253
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:11,417
I write it down, and we go to the
next letter.

254
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,687
So we make words and phrases.

255
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:18,727
One more thing: 
If a word is finished, give two blinks.

256
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:24,437
As if you were typing. 
If I make the wrong letter, you blink rapidly.

257
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:29,127
It does not sound easy, but it will work.

258
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:33,052
Your friends and family will profit too.

259
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:36,552
Are you ready,Mr. Bauby? 
Look at me.

260
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:41,944
Do you want to try? 
You have something to say?

261
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:43,847
Very well.

262
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,922
Let's try it. 
- <i> Wait, no...</i>

263
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:50,607
<i>Let me think what I will say.</i>
- E.

264
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:54,616
Is E your first letter?
- <i>No.</i>

265
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:56,713
E is not the first letter.

266
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:59,087
<i>I don't even know what to say.</i>

267
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:03,522
I know this is difficult. 
We'll go slowly.

268
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:07,578
E, S, A...

269
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,027
<i>This goes too slow.</i>

270
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:21,716
<i>I can't keep my eye 
open this long.</i>

271
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:23,816
<i>Hurry up.</i>

272
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,987
<i>I.</i>

273
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:30,827
I?
- <i>Bravo.</i>

274
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,667
Is I your first letter?

275
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:38,322
<i>My first word is I. 
I start with myself.</i>

276
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:40,347
E, S...

277
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:41,767
S?

278
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,867
<i>No.</i>
- No?

279
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:46,786
Not S. 
</i>That went too fast.</i>

280
00:23:50,747 --> 00:23:54,527
<i>This will never work. Your idea 
is a nightmare.</i>

281
00:23:54,627 --> 00:23:56,127
Do we continue?

282
00:23:58,627 --> 00:23:01,627
<i>Noirtier de Villefort</i>

283
00:24:03,787 --> 00:24:06,187
<i>Just leave me alone.</i>

284
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,857
<i>Up, down, up.</i>

285
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:37,147
<i>Under my arms.</i>

286
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:40,527
<i>The back of my legs.</i>

287
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:43,503
<i>I am 42 years old...</i>

288
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:47,992
<i>and I'm handled like 
a big baby.</i>

289
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:53,261
<i>My ass is washed and diapered.</i>

290
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:57,077
<i>It's simply laughable.</i>

291
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:00,896
<i>But as the poet said:</i>

292
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:05,187
<i>Only crazy people laugh 
when there is nothing to laugh about.</i>

293
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:07,662
 I want you to blow me a kiss.

294
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:08,767
<i>Say what?</i>

295
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,867
Go ahead.

296
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:13,627
Try it.

297
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,227
Go ahead.

298
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:23,547
Try.

299
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:26,007
It is difficult.
- <i>Please, no mirror.</i>

300
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,367
You have to do this.
- <i>Not that face.</i>

301
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:32,953
When you're resting or watching TV,

302
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:35,542
I want you to blow me kisses.

303
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:37,747
Okay?
- <i>Yes.</i>

304
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:41,047
Another thing you should practice...

305
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:43,937
Is sliding your tongue...

306
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:46,237
to the back of your palate.

307
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:50,499
That's how you'll learn to swallow.
Watch.

308
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,077
<i>God, this isn't fair. Not fair at all.</i>

309
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:09,899
Your turn.
- <i>Away with that mirror.</i>

310
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:12,947
Open your mouth.

311
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:15,447
Good.

312
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:19,457
Try sliding your tongue backwards.

313
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:24,607
<i>I can't do it.</i>
- Go on, try it.

314
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,743
<i>I can't do it.</i>

315
00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:29,327
That's great. You moved your tongue.


316
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:33,847
<i>Don't make me do this, Dear.</i>
- Do it again.

317
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:40,019
Incredible. It's good.
- <i>It's weird.</i>

318
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:48,664
I will help you to move your head...
Like this.

319
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:54,219
<i>You're doing it all.</i>
- And left.

320
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,147
Very good.

321
00:26:57,187 --> 00:26:59,940
Now right. Good.

322
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:04,227
And left again.

323
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:17,545
Do you feel my hands on your face?

324
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:19,407
<i>No.</i>

325
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:22,397
Never mind. You will.

326
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:29,017
We all feel honoured to have you here.

327
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:34,272
I'm a regular reader of Elle.
I love it.

328
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:38,517
But I think all the models look
like boys.

329
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:47,297
<i>Do you think?</i>
- They are all becoming so thin.

330
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,867
A strange trend.

331
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,303
<i>She is so beautiful.</i>

332
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:59,260
I have a strong faith.
I pray for you every day.

333
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:04,254
He can only see  with his right eye.

334
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:06,447
Look at him directly when you speak.

335
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:08,547
<i>Who is this?</i>

336
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:15,747
<i>Pierre Roussin.</i>
- Hello.

337
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:21,063
Do you recognize me?
- <i>Of course.</i>

338
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,872
He blinks once for yes...

339
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:24,887
<i>I never called him back.</i>

340
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:28,302
should I leave?  - No,no.
- <i>Please stay.</i>

341
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:31,087
<i>Why haven't I called him back?</i>

342
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:34,097
I heard what had happened to you...

343
00:28:34,197 --> 00:28:35,397
and I wanted...

344
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:41,577
No. I was compelled to come
because of what happened to me.

345
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:47,387
In a way, I know what you're going through.

346
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:53,312
Being taken hostage is not so different...

347
00:28:53,412 --> 00:28:55,412
from your situation.

348
00:28:56,347 --> 00:28:58,472
You understand?
- Hostage?

349
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:04,487
Jean-Dominique was kind enough
to give me his seat on a plane.

350
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:07,901
The flight was hijacked and I...

351
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,996
became a hostage in Beirut. 4 years...

352
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:14,745
4 years,4 months, 
2 weeks, 5 days...

353
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:16,607
and 7 hours.

354
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:21,462
I was held in a small, dark cellar.

355
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,962
It was hard to breathe.

356
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:27,097
I called it my tomb...

357
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:35,944
I know about wines.
-  <i>What happened to his hands?</i>

358
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:39,533
Each day I recited aloud the classes...

359
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:42,863
of the best Bordeaux wines from 1855.

360
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:48,687
Château Margaux, Château 
Lafite Rotschild, etc...

361
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:56,102
That kept me sane. 
Or what passed for sanity.

362
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:06,546
Most of the time I was desperate, 
suicidal and angry.

363
00:30:09,227 --> 00:30:12,740
The beatings, the filth, the cruelty...

364
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:17,342
especially the waiting.
That was the worst.

365
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:19,867
But I survived...

366
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:23,963
by keeping a grip...

367
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:26,663
on my own humanity.

368
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:31,942
I had no choice.

369
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:35,842
That's all I had... Just like you.

370
00:30:38,907 --> 00:30:45,176
Cling to your own humanity and 
you will survive.

371
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:50,823
<i>Humanity? Not easy.</i>
- I had to come and say this to you.

372
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:56,487
<i>Why didn't I  call him 
after he returned from Beruit?</i>

373
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,327
<i>I felt guilty.</i>

374
00:30:58,427 --> 00:31:03,432
I had to tell you.
- <i>I am ashamed of myself.</i>

375
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,747
V?

376
00:31:17,187 --> 00:31:19,187
E?

377
00:31:19,787 --> 00:31:21,787
I want?

378
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:24,267
What do you want , Mr Bauby?

379
00:31:34,587 --> 00:31:36,587
M.

380
00:31:45,107 --> 00:31:47,107
O.

381
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:58,307
U.

382
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:04,502
R. Mourir. To die.

383
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:07,547
You want to die?

384
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:11,547
How can you say that?

385
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:18,567
There are people who love you, 
who care for you.

386
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:22,047
I hardly know you, but 
I care for you already.

387
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:25,007
You're alive. So don't say
that you want to die.

388
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:27,487
It's an offense. It's obscene.

389
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,867
Do you want to continue?

390
00:32:36,227 --> 00:32:38,227
Very well.

391
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:41,787
I hope you will change your mind.

392
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,703
I apologize.

393
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:18,265
<i>Why?
- I went too far.</i>

394
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:24,347
Rest well.

395
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:39,257
Do you like it.

396
00:33:39,357 --> 00:33:42,007
I didn't really know what to bring.

397
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:44,827
I also brought this.

398
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:48,860
One moment
-<i>What are you doing?</i>

399
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,227
<i>What is that?</i>

400
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:55,347
<i>Oh no.
I will look like a rabbit.</i>

401
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:58,947
I'll read the letters and you blink.

402
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:00,047
Okay?

403
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:02,147
<i>Just leave.</i>
- Okay?

404
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:09,135
S or A?
- <i>You chose.</i>

405
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:13,260
A.
- <i>Okay then, A.</i>

406
00:34:20,147 --> 00:34:22,147
N?

407
00:34:22,347 --> 00:34:24,347
<i>Okay, N.</i>

408
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,667
<i>Anna.</i>

409
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:32,967
<i>You must look at me, Laurent.</i>
- Sorry.


410
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,230
I forgot to look at you.

411
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,047
Sorry, I'll start again. Slower.

412
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:40,297
<i>Whatever...</i>

413
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:49,167
<i>Too funny.</i>

414
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:52,225
I've never been a good hospital visitor.

415
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:54,700
I usually brings grapes and then 
eat them.

416
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,807
This is aweful.

417
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:57,687
Why did this happen to you?

418
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:01,247
You hear people talking.
Yesterday in Cafe de Flore...

419
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:04,201
Someone said,
'Did you know that ...

420
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:06,767
Jean-Do is now a 
complete vegetable?'

421
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:09,347
<i>Vegtable?</i>
- He can't see you there.

422
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:11,807
<i>Who said that?</i>

423
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:16,822
<i>Am I a carrot, a potato, 
a Kosher pickle?</i>

424
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:24,222
<i>Yes, go. Go on. Leave the carrot.</i>

425
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:20,622
<i>Noirtier de Villefort</i>

426
00:36:29,907 --> 00:36:31,963
<i>Today my whole life seems like...</i>

427
00:36:32,063 --> 00:36:35,293
<i>nothing but a  chain of small failures.</i>

428
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:39,454
<i>The women I was unable to love...</i>

429
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:41,527
<i>the opportunities missed...</i>

430
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:45,567
<i>moments of chance that I 
let escape.</i>

431
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,447
<i>A race whose result I knew 
in advance...</i>

432
00:36:48,547 --> 00:36:52,202
<i>but in which I never made a bet 
on the winner.</i>

433
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,712
<i>Was I blind or deaf?</i>

434
00:36:55,907 --> 00:36:58,195
<i>Or did I need a disaster...</i>

435
00:36:58,295 --> 00:37:02,845
<i> to see the truth 
about myself.</i>

436
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:11,267
I'm still here.

437
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:17,422
Are you feeling more co-operative?

438
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:25,187
Good.

439
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,367
We're going to master this.

440
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:30,697
Are you ready?
- <i>Yes, Teacher.</i>

441
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:32,867
Very well.

442
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:35,187
I'll begin.

443
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,667
M?

444
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:53,427
E?

445
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,667
R?

446
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:07,541
C? Merci?

447
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,467
Thank you?

448
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:12,947
Thank you.

449
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:16,447
May I call you Jean-Do??
- <i>Women are so uncomplicated.</i>

450
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,547
Thank you, Jean-Do.

451
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:31,747
J?

452
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,667
A? I have?

453
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:42,965
<i>I have decided not to pity 
myself any longer.</i>

454
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:51,487
<i>Two of my parts other than 
my right eye are not paralyzed.</i>

455
00:38:51,987 --> 00:38:53,787
<i>My imagination...</i>

456
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:56,947
<i>and my memory.</i>

457
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:13,934
<i>Imagination and memory are what
 I must use....</i>

458
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:16,139
<i>to escape my diving bell.</i>

459
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:43,699
<i>I have realized I can imagine
anything, anyone, anywhere.</i>

460
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:54,007
<i>I can feel the waves caress 
me on the Isle of Martinique.</i>

461
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:57,742
<i>I can visit the women I love....</i>

462
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:08,437
<i>Bow down before...</i>

463
00:40:08,537 --> 00:40:11,512
<i>Ozymandias, king of kings.</i>

464
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,415
<i>I can imagine anything at all.</i>

465
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:24,995
<i>I make my childhood dreams live; or my 
ambitions as an adult.</i>

466
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,887
<i>And now I choose to remember myself 
as I was.</i>

467
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:32,607
<i>Handsome, debonair, glamorous,
and devilishly attractive.</i>

468
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:35,462
<i>Yes. Glamorous and  handsome.</i>

469
00:40:35,562 --> 00:40:38,792
<i>This about me...
not Marlon Brando.</i>

470
00:40:38,795 --> 00:40:40,795
<i>THIS IS ME.</i>

471
00:41:12,307 --> 00:41:16,302
Is this Betty Mialet?
- ' Yes, this is she '.

472
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:21,421
I am Henriette Durand,
I'm a therapist at Berck sur Mer.

473
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:25,567
I'm calling on behalf of a patient,
Jean-Dominique Bauby.

474
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:28,386
Jean-Do? How is he?

475
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:32,487
Okay, but...
- I have heard that he was paralyzed...

476
00:41:32,587 --> 00:41:35,666
' he can't  communicate with anyone. '

477
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:37,766
That's not absolutely accurate

478
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,927
Come in.

479
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:44,305
I called  to ask if you could do 
something for him.

480
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,662
Of course. One moment.

481
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:49,007
' What does he want? '

482
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,327
He says that he has a book 
contract with you.

483
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,247
He said...? I thought he couldn't speak?

484
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:59,579
He communicates. I will explain later.

485
00:41:59,787 --> 00:42:01,365
About this book...

486
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:04,247
Yes, he has a contract with us,...

487
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:08,247
but now, given the circumstances...
- He wants to do it.

488
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:09,971
To write the book.

489
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:13,192
' I beg your pardon. 
It's not possible. '

490
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:17,017
I assure you it is possible for him.

491
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:23,899
But, do you think you can find someone 
to take his dictation?

492
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:26,107
Someone with patience.

493
00:42:26,787 --> 00:42:32,339
Someone available each day. 
A special someone.

494
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:35,505
I understand. I'll call you back.

495
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:40,507
Betty Mialet said Claude Mendibil 
was sent from heaven...

496
00:42:40,607 --> 00:42:42,696
perfect for this type of work.

497
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:46,607
Betty always exaggerates. I have to 
practice first with Henriette.

498
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:49,257
No problem. It won't take long.

499
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:51,787
He wants to say something.

500
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,627
A?

501
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:17,347
Don't panic.

502
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:24,108
Claude has taken a room
in Berck. You should...

503
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:26,207
make a schedule.

504
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:32,257
<i>The nurse wakes me at 5 a.m.,
then I decide what I will write.</i>

505
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:36,802
<i>You can come at 8 and 
I will dictate what I've prepared.</i>

506
00:43:37,507 --> 00:43:42,706
Very well. I'll do my best.
- <i>I'm sure of it.</i>

507
00:43:42,907 --> 00:43:46,392
<i>Can we can start tomorrow?</i>
- Yes sir.

508
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:19,746
<i>Behind?
- Behind the frayed curtain of my window...</i>

509
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,327
<i>a pale glow announces the breaking of day.</i>

510
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,967
<i>My feet hurt, my head weighs a ton.</i>

511
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:31,287
<i>My body is a prisoner in
this invisible diving-bell.</i>

512
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:35,007
<i>I compose these bed-ridden
travel notes,...</i>

513
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:38,847
<i>...as a castaway on the shores 
of lonliness.</i>

514
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:44,872
<i>This Hospital was once a home for 
children with tuberculosis.</i>

515
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:49,407
<i>In the large hall stands a white marble bust of...</i>

516
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:52,807
<i>Empress Eugénie, the wife 
of Napoleon III...</i>

517
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:55,906
<i>the founder of the hospital.</i>

518
00:44:56,006 --> 00:44:57,207
<i>She came frequently.</i>

519
00:44:57,307 --> 00:45:01,283
<i>It has been a fat farm, a school, a place...</i>

520
00:45:01,387 --> 00:45:05,167
<i>where the great Diaghilev rehearsed
his Ballet Russe.</i>

521
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:08,231
<i>It was here that Nijinsky reportedly...</i>

522
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,306
<i>leapt 12 feet into the air.</i>

523
00:45:13,867 --> 00:45:16,335
<i>No one here now leaps in the air.</i>

524
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:21,357
<i>Now everyone here is elderly and weak, 
or like me...</i>

525
00:45:21,457 --> 00:45:23,127
<i>rigid and mute.</i>

526
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:25,297
<i>A battalion of cripples.</i>

527
00:45:28,507 --> 00:45:30,775
<i>I enjoy being wheeled to a spot... </i>

528
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,167
<i>which I call Cinecittà .</i>

529
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:35,687
<i>A deserted terrace that opens 
on a landscape...</i>

530
00:45:35,787 --> 00:45:39,867
<i>that has a poetic charm like a movie set.</i>

531
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:42,306
<i>A handful of buildings at the...</i>

532
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:46,727
<i> foot of the dune look like a ghost town 
in a Western.</i>

533
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,807
<i>When I see the suburbs of Berck,...</i>

534
00:45:49,907 --> 00:45:52,546
<i>it's like a miniature train lay-out.</i>

535
00:45:54,027 --> 00:45:58,847
<i>The white foam of the sea is almost
created by special effects.</i>

536
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:02,092
<i>My favorite sight of all is the lighthouse.</i>

537
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:07,242
<i>Tall, robust, reassuring in 
red and white stripes.</i>

538
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:09,047
<i>I accept the protection...</i>

539
00:46:09,147 --> 00:46:10,687
<i>of this symbol of
brotherhood...</i>

540
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:12,907
<i>guardian not only of sailors...</i>

541
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:14,367
<i>but of the sick whom...</i>

542
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:17,367
<i>fate has cast to the far edges of life.</i>

543
00:46:17,467 --> 00:46:20,717
' The two peaks of this mini museum:

544
00:46:20,817 --> 00:46:23,167
the white marble bust...

545
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:26,230
which embodies the radiating youth...

546
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:29,447
of a princess who died at age 94;

547
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:31,527
...and also her empire. '

548
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:36,142
<i>Five hours of work. Not too bad.</i>

549
00:46:39,347 --> 00:46:42,347
<i> But, I'm no Balzac.</i>

550
00:46:43,027 --> 00:46:45,027
Do I continue?

551
00:46:48,587 --> 00:46:50,178
<i>I read Balzac.</i>

552
00:46:50,278 --> 00:46:54,107
' It was well to hear nothing.'
- <i>Graham Greene.</i>

553
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,807
' Then, incidentally, it became clear.'

554
00:46:56,907 --> 00:46:59,697
' Suddenly a policeman beat him. '

555
00:46:59,797 --> 00:47:02,976
' This was rather shocking to him. '

556
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:06,387
' He belonged to the upper class which...

557
00:47:06,487 --> 00:47:08,887
viewed the police as protection. '

558
00:47:08,987 --> 00:47:12,927
' I am 45, divorced,
and I want to call the consulate...

559
00:47:13,027 --> 00:47:16,785
regarding this policeman that 
called me a pig...

560
00:47:16,885 --> 00:47:18,825
and demand his passport. '

561
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:49,992
What's this?
- Is it a man or a woman?

562
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:56,522
I think a man.
- He winked at you.

563
00:47:58,907 --> 00:48:03,752
Pardon, but you have ordered a phone
with loud-spreakers?

564
00:48:09,107 --> 00:48:11,487
Did  you order a telephone?

565
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:15,987
We can come back later.

566
00:48:17,627 --> 00:48:20,847
What are you doing here?
Who let you in?

567
00:48:20,947 --> 00:48:23,527
We're from the telephone company.

568
00:48:23,627 --> 00:48:27,962
Then you should check in at reception.
- Nobody was there.

569
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:31,220
Then put it on the table, please.

570
00:48:37,747 --> 00:48:40,552
Be careful, please.

571
00:48:41,747 --> 00:48:44,007
We will tell your friends and family...

572
00:48:44,107 --> 00:48:46,367
then they can arrange times to call.

573
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:49,612
We will be sure then that there is 
someone with you.

574
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:58,887
Excuse me. Can't he talk?
- Don't act like he's not here.

575
00:48:58,987 --> 00:49:01,057
Do you have a question for him?

576
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:03,267
Excuse me. If he can't speak...

577
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:05,247
why does he want a phone?

578
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:07,642
Maybe he's a heavy breather.

579
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:13,162
Do you think you're funny?
<i>Ha ha ha...</i>

580
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:17,107
How dare they.

581
00:49:18,147 --> 00:49:21,717
<i>You have no sense of humor, Henriette.</i>

582
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,632
<i>A big black fly lands on my nose.</i>

583
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:50,431
<i>I twist my head to shake him off.</i>

584
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:51,927
<i>He just sits there.</i>

585
00:49:52,027 --> 00:49:54,127
<i>Olympic wrestling is nothing in comparison.</i>

586
00:49:54,227 --> 00:49:57,967
You moved your head. 
When did you start that?

587
00:49:57,987 --> 00:49:59,987
<i>Thank you.</i>

588
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:10,567
Now?

589
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:13,527
It's wonderful. You moved your head.

590
00:50:13,627 --> 00:50:15,598
<i>Always Marie sees miracles.</i>

591
00:50:15,698 --> 00:50:18,567
Dr. Lepage, he has moved his head.

592
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:19,367
Hello.

593
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:21,667
<i>A miracle: only one 'hello'.</i>

594
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:24,642
Progress. Progress.
- <i>Ha. This is better.</i>

595
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:31,612
Show me your tongue.
I'll open your mouth.

596
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:35,103
There.
- He moved it a little.

597
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:37,627
Then his speech will begin to progress.

598
00:50:37,727 --> 00:50:40,087
The tongue is essential.
There is hope.

599
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:42,496
Great, this is terrific.

600
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:47,212
We will work very hard, so you 
can begin to eat.

601
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:51,247
<i>A book does not exist until it is read.</i>

602
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:54,070
<i>I recall giving my father a shave.</i>

603
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,487
<i>I visited him one week before 
my accident.</i>

604
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,259
<i>He was not well, so I spent the night...</i>

605
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,367
<i>in his apartment in Paris.</i>

606
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:05,647
<i>In the morning I shaved him.</i>
- Leave me be.

607
00:51:05,747 --> 00:51:08,857
Who cares if I am shaved or not?

608
00:51:08,957 --> 00:51:10,657
I do.

609
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:14,021
I am terrified.
- Of what?

610
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:17,496
Of you shaving me.

611
00:51:19,027 --> 00:51:22,727
You were always so damned clumsy.
- It runs in the family.

612
00:51:22,827 --> 00:51:24,407
Yes.

613
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:26,543
Coffee?
- No. No.

614
00:51:29,307 --> 00:51:31,281
Don't tire him. He's not well.

615
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:34,322
How can a shave tire him?

616
00:51:40,107 --> 00:51:44,527
Your mother was prettier.
- That wouldn't be difficult.

617
00:51:44,627 --> 00:51:47,778
Do you still think of your Mother?
- Oh, that.

618
00:51:49,027 --> 00:51:53,902
You always ask me that and I always
say the same thing: ...not really.

619
00:51:57,427 --> 00:51:58,877
What are you reading at the moment?

620
00:51:58,977 --> 00:52:02,626
Re-reading. The Count of Monte Cristo.

621
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:03,787
Why?

622
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:07,815
I'm thinking of writing a modern version.

623
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:11,002
Of the Count of Monte Cristo?
- Yes.

624
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:15,225
Vengeance will still be the 
driving force...

625
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:20,306
but set in today's world, with the
main character a woman.

626
00:52:22,787 --> 00:52:25,927
<i>The Countess of Monte Cristo?
- Yes, a woman.</i>

627
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:28,045
I don't want to read it.

628
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,385
I haven't written it yet.

629
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:36,306
I have a contract with a publisher.

630
00:52:39,987 --> 00:52:43,812
If you cut me, I'll take you to court.

631
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:52,496
The doctor was here yesterday.
- And?

632
00:52:53,347 --> 00:52:56,285
He said that I would live to be 100.

633
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:59,247
Great. We can make a big celebration.

634
00:52:59,347 --> 00:53:03,959
I won't attend.
Who wants to live to be a hundred?

635
00:53:04,987 --> 00:53:08,377
Jean-Do, Don't tell a soul.

636
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:11,807
I still miss your mother.

637
00:53:13,507 --> 00:53:18,182
I won't tell. It will be our secret.

638
00:53:19,427 --> 00:53:22,076
You should have married Céline.

639
00:53:22,176 --> 00:53:24,697
What difference would it have made?

640
00:53:25,227 --> 00:53:29,209
You wouldn't have left her so easily...

641
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:30,767
and your children.

642
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:33,348
Can we talk about this another time?

643
00:53:33,448 --> 00:53:35,367
I know what I'm talking about.

644
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:42,066
No one had more affairs than I did.
Well, perhaps Casanova.

645
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:45,652
An affair is not enough reason to leave...

646
00:53:45,752 --> 00:53:48,132
the mother of your children.

647
00:53:48,227 --> 00:53:51,237
There are no standards anymore.

648
00:53:51,337 --> 00:53:54,397
It's not funny, it's true.

649
00:53:56,747 --> 00:54:00,527
Bring your children to see me.
Céline brings them.

650
00:54:00,627 --> 00:54:02,232
You need to also.

651
00:54:02,332 --> 00:54:05,367
Well, I've spent enough time 
with this.

652
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:07,935
What's that?

653
00:54:08,107 --> 00:54:12,737
Orange blossom.
- Should I smell like a tart?

654
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:16,902
It's an aphrodisiac.

655
00:54:17,867 --> 00:54:21,518
That will make the girls come running.

656
00:54:21,618 --> 00:54:25,057
Certainly, if they had the chance 
to smell you.

657
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:27,946
Let me look at myself.

658
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:46,772
Not bad. They don't make them 
like me anymore.

659
00:55:02,147 --> 00:55:05,642
I, I wanted to tell you something.
- Eh?

660
00:55:06,307 --> 00:55:09,767
I can't remember.
- It will come back.

661
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:11,287
I'm not so sure.

662
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:15,567
Not much comes back anymore.
- Don't exaggerate.

663
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:18,977
Oh, yes. I remember what I wanted 
to tell you.

664
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:26,179
I am proud of you. 
Really, very very proud.

665
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,427
And another thing...

666
00:55:38,307 --> 00:55:40,423
I've forgotten.

667
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:44,767
<i>My father's approval. I found it 
comforting then...</i>

668
00:55:44,867 --> 00:55:49,287
<i>...and I find it even more so now. 
We are all children.</i>

669
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,362
<i>We all need recognition.</i>

670
00:55:53,307 --> 00:55:55,457
<i>I want to see my children.</i>

671
00:55:56,427 --> 00:55:58,552
<i>I want to see my children.</i>

672
00:56:01,467 --> 00:56:05,585
Here we are. It's Father's Day.

673
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:08,056
Happy Father's Day, Papa.

674
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:22,247
<i>Even a rough sketch, a shadow...</i>

675
00:56:22,347 --> 00:56:26,407
<i>a tiny fragment of a dad is 
still a dad.</i>

676
00:56:47,347 --> 00:56:50,460
<i>Father's Day. My son wiping the 
saliva that...</i>

677
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,407
<i>escapes my lips.</i>

678
00:56:52,507 --> 00:56:56,785
<i>We never before celebrated 
this farcical holiday.</i>

679
00:57:01,307 --> 00:57:04,822
You cry because you did not...

680
00:57:05,027 --> 00:57:07,967
marry with such a beautiful boy.

681
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:12,807
Claude says you make good 
progress on the book.

682
00:57:12,907 --> 00:57:15,372
It's fantastic that you're writing it.

683
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:18,982
You are the most wonderful man 
that I know.

684
00:57:19,307 --> 00:57:21,432
Have you had many visitors?

685
00:57:25,427 --> 00:57:27,427
Laurent, Anne-Marie...

686
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,747
...Michel...

687
00:57:32,147 --> 00:57:35,139
Has she been? No, hmm?

688
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:40,677
Isn't she hopelessly in love
with you?

689
00:57:40,777 --> 00:57:42,777
Well, it's her business.

690
00:57:48,027 --> 00:57:50,577
Should we practice the alphabet?

691
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:38,487
<i>' When I began a diet a week 
before my stroke,...</i>

692
00:58:38,587 --> 00:58:42,137
<i>I never dreamed of such dramatic 
results.</i>

693
00:58:42,237 --> 00:58:45,797
<i>This is radical.'</i>
- You're crazy.

694
00:58:46,987 --> 00:58:51,228
<i>'Now they know how it is

695

00:58:54,707 --> 00:58:55,967
That's not nice.

697
00:58:56,067 --> 00:58:58,067
Kids.

698
00:58:59,627 --> 00:59:01,837
Do you want to play Hangman, Papa?

699
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:06,142
I'll help you. Whisper a word.

700
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:10,407
The first letter is C. The last is E.

701
00:59:10,507 --> 00:59:12,507
There are 7 letters.

702
00:59:55,227 --> 00:59:59,982
The kangaroo has leaped
over the wall...

703
01:00:00,187 --> 01:00:02,621
over the the wall of the zoo.

704
01:00:02,827 --> 01:00:07,662
Oh my, he jumped so high.

705
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:13,021
Oh my, he was so beautiful.
Oh my, he jumped so high.

706
01:00:13,187 --> 01:00:14,187
That's all.

707
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:17,092
Says good-bye to Papa, Kids. 
Let's go.

708
01:00:20,347 --> 01:00:22,347
Bye, Papa.

709
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:32,824
Bye, Papa. Until next week.

710
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:02,807
<i>There are no words to express the
grief that surges over me.</i>

711
01:01:02,907 --> 01:01:06,991
<i>I, their father, can't even ruffle 
their hair...</i>

712
01:01:07,091 --> 01:01:09,540
<i>hug their necks...</i>

713
01:01:09,747 --> 01:01:13,367
<i>or hold their warm bodies 
against me.</i>

714
01:01:13,467 --> 01:01:17,764
<i>However, I am happy to see them 
living, moving...</i>

715
01:01:17,864 --> 01:01:19,864
<i>and laughing.</i>

716
01:01:20,587 --> 01:01:23,499
<i>I call that a beautiful day.</i>

717
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:31,382
<i>I'm feeling sorry for myself again.
No?</i>

718
01:01:31,507 --> 01:01:33,632
You were genuinely happy.

719
01:01:34,587 --> 01:01:36,587
<i>You think?</i>

720
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,027
<i>Perhaps.</i>

721
01:01:45,547 --> 01:01:46,547
<i>Make this kick.</i>

722
01:01:47,547 --> 01:01:49,620
<i>Away from the T.V.</i>

723
01:01:52,327 --> 01:01:54,342
<i>Oh, shit. Sheesh.</i>

724
01:01:54,442 --> 01:01:57,442
See you later.
- <i> Yeh. Later.</i>

725
01:01:58,242 --> 01:02:00,342
<i>What are you doing?</i>

726
01:02:00,442 --> 01:02:02,242
Oh, God.

727
01:02:05,047 --> 01:02:07,530
<i>No T.V. dinner tonight.</i>

728
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:10,520
<i>Where will I dine this evening?</i>

729
01:02:11,467 --> 01:02:15,621
<i>I want to treat myself to a feast...</i>

730
01:02:15,721 --> 01:02:17,721
<i>at Le Duc.</i>

731
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:31,139
What a coincidence to find you here.
- Isn't it incredible?

732
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:34,347
An oyster?

733
01:03:12,947 --> 01:03:18,377
It seems like it was just yesterday 
when I first heard your name.

734
01:04:36,107 --> 01:04:38,107
Soft.

735
01:04:41,107 --> 01:04:43,607
Stop it. I don't like compliments.

736
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:48,007
What is the next chapter.

737
01:04:48,107 --> 01:04:51,497
<i>Sunday. Sundays are frightening.</i>

738
01:04:52,507 --> 01:04:55,132
<i>If someone turns on the 
T.V. for you,...</i>

739
01:04:55,232 --> 01:04:57,537
<i>you have to be alert not to miss it.</i>

740
01:04:57,707 --> 01:04:59,347
<i>It is high strategy.</i>

741
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:03,540
<i>Maybe you will have to 
wait 3 hours.</i>

742
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,167
<i>Before a Samaritan 
turns it back on.</i>

743
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:07,675
<i>Terrible Sundays.</i>

744
01:05:07,775 --> 01:05:10,007
<i>No speech therapy, no psycho-therapy.</i>

745
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:12,127
<i>No physical therapy. No visitors.</i>

746
01:05:12,227 --> 01:05:14,527
<i>Bare-bones staff.</i>

747
01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:17,007
<i>Sunday is a long desert excursion.</i>

748
01:05:17,107 --> 01:05:22,047
<i>But today, Marie has nobly 
suggested she take me to Mass.</i>

749
01:05:22,147 --> 01:05:25,210
<i>I explained to her that I am not religious,</i>

750
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:27,127
<i>but that was in vain.</i>

751
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:29,897
<i>Everywhere people are praying for me.</i>

752
01:05:29,997 --> 01:05:32,972
<i>First on the list is my daughter, Céleste.</i>

753
01:05:33,147 --> 01:05:35,147
<i>And Marie...naturally.</i>

754
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:39,041
<i>The most diverse deities 
have been evoked...</i>

755
01:05:39,141 --> 01:05:40,167
<i>to help me.</i>

756
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:43,837
<i>In Nepal they chant a mantra for me.</i>

757
01:05:43,987 --> 01:05:46,844
<i>In Cameroon a medicine man 
has procured...</i>

758
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:49,247
<i>the goodwill of the African gods.</i>

759
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:52,237
<i>I have delegated my right eye to him.</i>

760
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:55,143
<i>I can't deny it.
I've tried to organize...</i>

761
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,207
<i>this vast spiritual energy...</i>

762
01:05:57,307 --> 01:05:59,287
<i>to salvage my existence.</i>

763
01:05:59,387 --> 01:06:01,972
<i>It may not be admirable,</i>

764
01:06:02,072 --> 01:06:05,972
<i>it may even be hypocritical,
but I'll try anything.</i>

765
01:06:13,227 --> 01:06:15,522
I'm glad to see you here.

766
01:06:16,107 --> 01:06:18,088
I came to visit you a few days ago...

767
01:06:18,188 --> 01:06:20,847
I came to give you Communion...

768
01:06:20,947 --> 01:06:22,947
but you were sleeping.

769
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,456
Yes, that's right.
- <i>What?</i>

770
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:29,939
Do you want to take communion now?
<i>No.</i>

771
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:33,567
Yes.
- Do you want to be blessed?

772
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:35,667
<i>No.</i>
- Yes.

773
01:06:36,547 --> 01:06:39,476
Lord, have mercy on Jean-Dominique...

774
01:06:39,576 --> 01:06:41,407
who is cruelly afflicted.

775
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:46,456
Help his body to heal and 
keep his spirits light.

776
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:49,407
Help him to find faith.
- <i> My spirit is already lighted.</i>

777
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:51,483
In the name of the Father...

778
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:54,852
<i>You fucked me good.</i>

779
01:07:06,507 --> 01:07:08,507
My?

780
01:07:11,707 --> 01:07:13,707
My Father?

781
01:07:33,427 --> 01:07:37,706
<i>My Father, There are priests in bordeaux...</i>

782
01:07:37,806 --> 01:07:41,927
<i>who pray regularly for me.</i>

783
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:44,763
That's good to hear.

784
01:07:44,863 --> 01:07:47,767
<i>But there have been no results.</i>

785
01:07:47,867 --> 01:07:51,647
We must have patience.
- <i>Yes. That's what the doctors say.</i>

786
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:54,722
Perhaps I can make  a proposal?

787
01:07:54,907 --> 01:07:57,307
Soon, I will make a pilgrimage trip...

788
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,407
to Lourdes.

789
01:07:58,507 --> 01:07:59,567
<i>Lourdes?</i>

790
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:02,727
Marie and I thought that you 
might want to go.

791
01:08:02,827 --> 01:08:05,507
<i>I smell a trap.</i>
- Miracles have happened there.

792
01:08:05,607 --> 01:08:09,192
It's true.
- <i>I've already been to Lourdes.</i>

793
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:37,487
Why don't we stop and go back.
- I am not turning back.

794
01:08:37,587 --> 01:08:39,847
It is my car. I'll drive where I want.

795
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:43,047
You said you wanted a dirty week-end.
- I never said that.

796
01:08:43,147 --> 01:08:47,567
We can't have a dirty week-end
in Lourdes. It just isn't right.

797
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:50,642
You only have one thing on your mind.

798
01:08:52,267 --> 01:08:54,303
I want to see the Madonna.

799
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,075
I don't believe you.

800
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,847
I want to see it and to drink the water.

801
01:09:00,947 --> 01:09:02,947
Spare me, please.

802
01:09:04,627 --> 01:09:08,197
You can do it too. It would be good for you.

803
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:15,927
Impressive. Huh?

804
01:09:17,427 --> 01:09:18,667
Pfft.

805
01:09:18,767 --> 01:09:21,897
I'll go buy bottles for the water.

806
01:09:43,507 --> 01:09:45,641
I've had it. I won't stay here.

807
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:49,059
You're wrong. It might be good for you.

808
01:09:49,267 --> 01:09:51,767
Don't be so sure, it might be dangerous.

809
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,247
Imagine what might happen 
to a healthy person by the...

810
01:09:55,347 --> 01:09:58,407
appearing of the Madonna.
They could be paralyzed.

811
01:09:58,507 --> 01:09:59,707
You're terrible.

812
01:10:00,307 --> 01:10:02,423
Hello.
- Hello, Miss.

813
01:10:02,627 --> 01:10:05,517
Look, I have found my Madonna.

814
01:10:07,647 --> 01:10:08,801
Forget it.

815
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:12,901
I don't want anything more 
to do with you.

816
01:10:14,187 --> 01:10:17,179
Okay. Okay. I'll give it to you as a present.

817
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:21,266
Madame has a good eye.
This Madonna...

818
01:10:21,366 --> 01:10:23,407
was blessed by the Cardinal.

819
01:10:23,507 --> 01:10:26,647
Do you have more 318's?
- Look in the magazines.

820
01:10:26,747 --> 01:10:30,023
How much is it?
- 300 euro.

821
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:32,227
That much?

822
01:10:35,387 --> 01:10:40,147
Don't we know each other?
- No sir, I don't think so.

823
01:10:41,627 --> 01:10:43,627
I have no change.

824
01:10:45,547 --> 01:10:50,052
I can't make love with her watching.
- I understand.

825
01:10:50,407 --> 01:10:53,467
I wasn't stating fact. I was complaining.

826
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:55,767
Let me turn it off.

827
01:10:56,267 --> 01:10:58,267
No.

828
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:03,700
It's the only one blessed by the Cardinal.

829
01:11:06,147 --> 01:11:10,967
Josephine, back in Paris,
we will have to seperate.

830
01:11:11,787 --> 01:11:15,541
Because of her?
- No, because of everything.

831
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:20,459
Fine. You're right.

832
01:11:32,627 --> 01:11:34,252
I'm going out.

833
01:11:34,927 --> 01:11:36,552
Turn off the light.

834
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,627
But not my Madonna.

835
01:13:10,707 --> 01:13:12,707
Go ahead, Jean-Do.

836
01:13:16,907 --> 01:13:20,582
If you can say ' La '
you can also swallow .

837
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:22,982
Even say  'Lourdes'.

838
01:13:31,347 --> 01:13:34,225
Are you in a comfortable position?

839
01:13:49,907 --> 01:13:53,807
<i>' The Pressure-Cooker ' can be the title of the piece...</i>

840
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:57,287
<i>that I will write concerning my experiences here.</i>

841
01:13:57,387 --> 01:14:01,047
<i>Or I can call it  ' One Eye ' or ' Diving Bell '.</i>

842
01:14:01,147 --> 01:14:03,661
<i>The plot and location have been determined.</i>

843
01:14:03,867 --> 01:14:07,607
<i>A hospital room. Here Mr. L.,
in the prime of life...</i>

844
01:14:07,707 --> 01:14:10,751
<i>with locked-in syndrome,
strains to find...</i>

845
01:14:10,851 --> 01:14:13,367
<i>life after a severe stroke.</i>

846
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:15,452
<i>Ambitious and a little cynical,...</i>

847
01:14:15,552 --> 01:14:17,927
<i>since he knew nothing of failure,...</i>

848
01:14:18,027 --> 01:14:21,763
<i>...Mr. L. learns to acknowledge
his dire distress.</i>

849
01:14:21,867 --> 01:14:23,877
<i>We follow this slow transformation...</i>

850
01:14:23,977 --> 01:14:26,347
<i>via a personal inner-narration,...</i>

851
01:14:26,447 --> 01:14:28,047
<i>expressing the feelings of Mr. L.</i>

852
01:14:28,147 --> 01:14:31,247
<i>I have the last scene already. 
- It is night.</i>

853
01:14:31,347 -->  01:14:34,367
<i>Mr L. has been immobile 
from the very opening.</i>

854
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:36,909
<i>Suddenly he throws off his blankets...</i>

855
01:14:37,009 --> 01:14:39,767
<i>and jumps off the bed.</i>

856
01:14:39,867 --> 01:14:42,961
<i>Then it becomes dark and we hear...</i>

857
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,527
<i>this monologue
from Mr L.,...</i>

858
01:14:45,627 --> 01:14:48,007
<i>' Fuck. It was just a dream. '</i>

859
01:15:16,027 --> 01:15:18,939
Stand up. You can stand up.

860
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:21,147
All is well.

861
01:16:00,827 --> 01:16:04,167
' I want to remember what has happened to me.'

862
01:16:04,267 --> 01:16:06,267
You want me to ask someone?

863
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,067
No?

864
01:16:21,027 --> 01:16:23,872
Hello. Room 119.

865
01:16:26,627 --> 01:16:30,197
This is Claude.
I'm here with Jean-Do.

866
01:16:30,267 --> 01:16:31,716
' This is his father. '

867
01:16:31,816 --> 01:16:35,027
Yes. We had expected your phone call.

868
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:41,540
What do I need to do? 
Speak normally?

869
01:16:42,627 --> 01:16:45,927
' Jean-Do can understand you. 
He will answer you. '

870
01:16:46,027 --> 01:16:51,499
' You will hear me say letters... '
- Yes. Céline explained it to me.

871
01:16:54,747 --> 01:16:57,898
' Start when you're ready, Mr. Bauby. '

872
01:16:58,067 --> 01:17:00,067
Can he hear me?

873
01:17:01,627 --> 01:17:05,063
Jean-Dominique, It's Papa.

874
01:17:07,987 --> 01:17:11,582
' I'm sitting by the open window. '

875
01:17:13,987 --> 01:17:17,982
' How goes it with you?
- Oh. It's a stupid question. '

876
01:17:30,027 --> 01:17:32,407
<i>Yes. It is.</i>

877
01:17:35,747 --> 01:17:37,747
I miss you.

878
01:17:51,907 --> 01:17:53,907
<i>I miss you , too.</i>

879
01:17:56,307 --> 01:18:00,061
It's really impossible to have a 
conversation like this.

880
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:05,112
I forgot everything that I wanted to say.
No. I remember.

881
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:11,141
I've sent you a gift.
A surprise.

882
01:18:15,627 --> 01:18:17,627
<i>I've been reflecting...</i>

883
01:18:18,307 --> 01:18:22,346
concerning us.
- We are in the same boat.

884
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:30,022
I'm trapped in this apartment, and 
cannot go down or up the stairs.

885
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:34,003
Try climbing four floors...

886
01:18:34,103 --> 01:18:36,103
<i>when you're 82.</i>

887
01:18:37,267 --> 01:18:40,942
We both have locked-in syndrome.

888
01:18:41,147 --> 01:18:46,062
You are locked inside your body,
and I inside my apartment.

889
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:48,456
Jean-Dominique, remember...

890
01:18:48,567 --> 01:18:54,087
that in the upper-right hand 
drawer of my desk there is a letter.

891
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:58,087
In it is my Will.

892
01:18:58,187 --> 01:19:00,287
It's, Jean-Do...

893
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:07,999
......a file marked 'Miscellaneous'.

894
01:19:12,307 --> 01:19:14,307
I have to hang up...

895
01:19:28,467 --> 01:19:32,380
<i>Don't cry.</i>
- It isn't easy to speak.

896
01:19:32,587 --> 01:19:35,465
You're my son, damn it.

897
01:19:36,707 --> 01:19:38,917
It occurs to me, Jean-Do.

898
01:19:40,147 --> 01:19:44,482
I almost forgot. You have your
birthday soon.

899
01:19:44,787 --> 01:19:46,787
I'll call again.

900
01:19:48,027 --> 01:19:50,027
Happy Birthday.

901
01:20:32,907 --> 01:20:36,533
<i>It's not easy to speak to a son...</i>

902
01:20:36,633 --> 01:20:39,353
<i>when you know he won't reply.</i>

903
01:20:40,353 --> 01:20:49,553
<i>Noirtier de Villefort</i>

904
01:20:57,467 --> 01:21:01,122
I thought that a trip might please you.

905
01:21:02,267 --> 01:21:05,942
I have another surprise. Close your eyes.

906
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:10,104
Close them. Close them.

907
01:21:15,827 --> 01:21:17,427
Now. Open them.

908
01:21:17,527 --> 01:21:19,687
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

909
01:21:19,787 --> 01:21:21,726
<i>You shouldn't have.</i>

910
01:21:22,487 --> 01:21:23,826
<i>In two volumes.</i>

911
01:21:23,927 --> 01:21:27,852
It's not a first edition, 
but it's pretty old.

912
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:31,922
Shall I read a bit?

913
01:21:33,587 --> 01:21:34,822
Which chapter?

914
01:21:35,747 --> 01:21:38,092
<i>We use Roman numerals.</i>

915
01:21:38,192 --> 01:21:40,407
<i>I have to think.</i>

916
01:21:40,507 --> 01:21:43,047
<i>What would it be in 
Roman numerals?</i>

917
01:21:43,147 --> 01:21:46,856
<i>It becomes L... I...X</i>

918
01:21:47,907 --> 01:21:51,183
<i>I'll do it faster next time.</i>

919
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:55,137
50? Higher?
- <i>Yes. Higher.</i>

920
01:21:57,587 --> 01:21:59,587
Nine? 59? Okay.

921
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,221
Here we go then.

922
01:22:03,427 --> 01:22:07,967
<i>There is the illustration.
The coincidence frightens me.</i>

923
01:22:08,067 --> 01:22:10,702
' They took their places near him...'

924
01:22:11,787 --> 01:22:13,857
<i>' Noirtier de Villefort in his wheelchair... '</i>

925
01:22:13,957 --> 01:22:16,847
<i>' from the early morning until late at night. '</i>

926
01:22:16,947 --> 01:22:21,127
<i>' With a mirror Noirtier could see 
the entire apartment. '</i>

927
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:26,207
<i>' Thus he did not have to move
 himself. Indeed, it was impossible. '</i>

928
01:22:26,307 --> 01:22:29,207
<i>' Sight and hearing were the only 
senses... '</i>

929
01:22:29,307 --> 01:22:33,425
<i>' still working in his dying frame. '</i>

930
01:22:34,187 --> 01:22:37,065
' ...already 3/4 ready for the grave.'

931
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:41,417
<i>Don't you think that it sounds like me?</i>

932
01:22:41,987 --> 01:22:43,987
No.
- <i>Oh, yes.</i>

933
01:22:44,187 --> 01:22:47,304
<i>I make people shudder, too.</i>

934
01:22:48,587 --> 01:22:49,863
That's not true.

935
01:22:49,963 --> 01:22:53,007
<i>I should never have considered 
rewriting Dumas.</i>

936
01:22:53,107 --> 01:22:57,241
<i>Don't tamper with a masterpiece. 
It's a lesson.</i>

937
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:01,598
<i>I didn't know Noirtier was the
man... </i>

938
01:23:01,698 --> 01:23:03,007
<i>I was to become.</i>

939
01:23:03,307 --> 01:23:08,567
<i>My diving bell has dragged you down
to the bottom of the sea with me.</i>

940
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:10,160
Jean-Do, if sometimes I am...

941
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:13,027
at the bottom of the sea with you,..

942
01:23:13,127 --> 01:23:16,317
you are also my butterfly.

943
01:23:17,507 --> 01:23:19,972
<i>That's a love declaration.</i>

944
01:23:21,707 --> 01:23:24,301
<i>When we finish this book ...</i>

945
01:23:24,427 --> 01:23:28,127
<i>...we will write another one
about sports.</i>

946
01:23:28,227 --> 01:23:31,292
<i>Then, maybe, I will start to run myself.</i>

947
01:23:32,987 --> 01:23:35,687
' I have missed you at the festival.

948
01:23:35,787 --> 01:23:39,127
However, I hope to see you there
next year, Jean-Paul. '

949
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:41,502
Le Tango, Nîmes.

950
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:57,706
' Dear Mr. Bauby, 
Concerning your order of a custom-made camper.

951
01:23:57,807 --> 01:24:03,504
We can deliver it to you 6 to 8 
months after your order.

952
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:08,702
Yours sincerely, Henri Raynaud.
That is good news.

953
01:24:10,947 --> 01:24:12,947
This is from your father.

954
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:21,867
' This is a gift. '

955
01:24:24,547 --> 01:24:28,032
Look, 
a photograph of you when you were young.

956
01:24:29,467 --> 01:24:32,357
Jean-Do, eight years old, Berck sur Mer.

957
01:24:36,347 --> 01:24:38,347
From Anne-Marie.

958
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:44,461
The room of Jean-Dominique Bauby.

959
01:24:44,561 --> 01:24:45,687
' With whom am I speaking? '

960
01:24:45,787 --> 01:24:48,452
Céline Desmoulins. And you are?

961
01:24:48,707 --> 01:24:53,223
' This is Inès. 
I want to speak with Jean-Do. '

962
01:24:54,947 --> 01:24:56,947
One moment.

963
01:24:59,507 --> 01:25:02,527
The speaker is on, so he can hear you.

964
01:25:02,627 --> 01:25:05,937
I can't speak with you there.

965
01:25:06,147 --> 01:25:10,106
You have no choice. 
There is no one else.

966
01:25:10,267 --> 01:25:13,752
' Isn't the therapist there. '
- Not today.

967
01:25:21,747 --> 01:25:23,747
' Darling.... '

968
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:28,883
' I said I'd come to see you,  but...

969
01:25:28,983 --> 01:25:31,727
when I got to the station, I turned around. '

970
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:33,827
' I just can't face it. '

971
01:25:34,427 --> 01:25:36,807
' Please, please forgive me. '

972
01:25:40,587 --> 01:25:42,367
' Céline? '
- Yes.

973
01:25:42,467 --> 01:25:44,445
' Can you leave the room
to get a snack? '

974
01:25:44,545 --> 01:25:48,144
' I have some personal things to say. '

975
01:25:48,347 --> 01:25:50,815
' I'm sorry. '
- I cannot.

976
01:25:51,027 --> 01:25:55,107
There's no one else. 
Wait, he wants to say something.

977
01:26:03,627 --> 01:26:05,627
One?

978
01:26:13,027 --> 01:26:15,027
One minute?

979
01:26:15,187 --> 01:26:18,077
I'm leaving the room. But not for long.

980
01:26:24,187 --> 01:26:27,224
' Are you there? '

981
01:26:30,827 --> 01:26:32,827
' Darling,...'

982
01:26:33,427 --> 01:26:35,807
' I love you more than ever. '

983
01:26:37,467 --> 01:26:41,122
' I want to see you, but 
not as you are now. '

984
01:26:42,347 --> 01:26:45,152
' I only want to think of you as you were. '

985
01:26:47,107 --> 01:26:49,107
' You will heal? Huh?'

986
01:26:50,667 --> 01:26:52,703
' I miss you. '

987
01:26:53,227 --> 01:26:58,902
' I miss you, I feel alone without you.
It's unbearable. '

988
01:26:59,027 --> 01:27:01,407
' I know you can understand. '

989
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:06,696
' You're always in my thoughts. '

990
01:27:13,547 --> 01:27:17,096
' I know your family is there with you. '

991
01:27:22,067 --> 01:27:24,067
' Do you want me to come? '

992
01:27:25,267 --> 01:27:27,887
I'm back.
- ' Do you want me to come? '

993
01:27:27,987 --> 01:27:32,265
' Do you want me to come? ' 
- I'm here, Inès.

994
01:28:21,227 --> 01:28:23,227
Every day...

995
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:04,942
Every day I wait for you.

996
01:29:05,227 --> 01:29:08,447
' Will you please repeat. 
I didn't understand. '

997
01:29:08,547 --> 01:29:10,547
' I didn't hear you. '

998
01:29:12,467 --> 01:29:15,272
He said, 'Every day he waits for you.'

999
01:30:20,027 --> 01:30:23,537
Excuse me, but if I don't get a 
seat on this plane...

1000
01:30:23,637 --> 01:30:26,897
I'll miss my connection to Hong-Kong.

1001
01:30:28,907 --> 01:30:31,626
Please, take my seat.
- Thanks.

1002
01:30:32,027 --> 01:30:35,172
I'll take the next flight.

1003
01:30:35,867 --> 01:30:37,867
Bon Voyage.

1004
01:30:41,007 --> 01:30:43,672
Oh, shit. You're not going
to Hong-Kong...

1005
01:30:43,872 --> 01:30:48,672
You're going to Beirut.

1006
01:30:57,747 --> 01:31:00,892
Are you okay? It will be okay.

1007
01:31:00,907 --> 01:31:03,182
Don't worry.

1008
01:31:10,907 --> 01:31:13,966
<i>Generally, I forget my dreams, and people....</i>

1009
01:31:14,066 --> 01:31:17,367
<i> who tell their dreams annoy everyone.</i>

1010
01:31:17,467 --> 01:31:21,547
<i>But this one kept recurring.
I don't know why.</i>

1011
01:31:21,787 --> 01:31:23,787
<i>It frightened me.</i>

1012
01:31:24,547 --> 01:31:28,372
<i>The feeling of doom doesn't leave me.</i>

1013
01:31:28,427 --> 01:31:31,453
<i>It took what I can only describe as
a miracle ....</i>

1014
01:31:31,553 --> 01:31:33,678
<i>to lift my spirits.</i>

1015
01:31:34,867 --> 01:31:37,276
<i>It's dangerous to believe in 
personal miracles.</i>

1016
01:31:37,376 --> 01:31:39,727
<i>They tend to make one feel 
self-important.</i>

1017
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:43,286
<i>Nevertheless, I must report that I
believe something...</i>

1018
01:31:43,386 --> 01:31:45,897
<i>miraculous did occur.</i>

1019
01:31:45,997 --> 01:31:48,461
<i>I began to sing.</i>

1020
01:31:49,947 --> 01:31:52,745
<i>I grunt. I sing.</i>

1021
01:31:53,907 --> 01:31:55,651
<i>My hearing isn't so great, but...</i>

1022
01:31:55,751 --> 01:31:57,887
<i>sometimes, I think I hear 
my heart beating.</i>

1023
01:31:57,987 --> 01:32:00,087
<i>But I believe it's the sound...</i>

1024
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:01,667
<i>of butterfly wings.</i>

1025
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:04,058
<i>I'm making firm progress 
and I may...</i>

1026
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:06,227
<i>have developed butterfly hearing.</i>

1027
01:32:06,327 --> 01:32:10,007
<i>I look forward to the future.
Soon the summer will end...</i>

1028
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:14,187
<i>and I will begin my first autumn 
in this hospital.</i>

1029
01:32:15,067 --> 01:32:17,067
<i>My life is here.</i>

1030
01:32:17,307 --> 01:32:19,687
<i>A constant repetition.</i>

1031
01:32:20,547 --> 01:32:22,547
<i>In this place.</i>

1032
01:32:22,827 --> 01:32:24,827
How are you?

1033
01:32:26,587 --> 01:32:28,407
He speaks.

1034
01:32:28,507 --> 01:32:31,305
He's speaking.
- He sings, too.

1035
01:32:31,867 --> 01:32:34,437
Go ahead, sing for Laurent.

1036
01:32:34,667 --> 01:32:37,137
Please, do it for me.

1037
01:32:43,627 --> 01:32:46,202
<i>The kangaroo has leaped
over the wall...</i>

1038
01:32:46,302 --> 01:32:48,727
<i>Over the the wall of the zoo....</i>

1039
01:32:48,827 --> 01:32:50,301
<i>He jumped so high...</i>

1040
01:32:50,401 --> 01:32:53,291
<i>Oh my, he was so beautiful.</i>

1041
01:32:54,467 --> 01:32:56,467
Are you okay?

1042
01:32:56,507 --> 01:32:59,227
Did he finish?
- No more singing now.

1043
01:33:17,907 --> 01:33:19,907
<i>I have pneumonia.</i>

1044
01:33:22,227 --> 01:33:24,377
<i>Just when I had hope.</i>

1045
01:33:36,947 --> 01:33:40,498
<i>Like a sailor who watches land gradually
sink away...</i>

1046
01:33:40,598 --> 01:33:43,182
<i>I see my past fading.</i>

1047
01:33:44,147 --> 01:33:47,632
<i>More and more of it is reduced 
to ashes.</i>

1048
01:34:02,467 --> 01:34:04,467
<i>What a come-back.</i>

1049
01:34:04,787 --> 01:34:07,967
<i>My office. 
I know that couple,... </i>

1050
01:34:08,067 --> 01:34:10,787
<i>but I don't recall their names.</i>

1051
01:34:11,747 --> 01:34:13,747
<i>This is my car?</i>

1052
01:34:14,187 --> 01:34:16,187
<i>My new car.</i>

1053
01:35:28,667 --> 01:35:30,667
Where's the horn?

1054
01:36:13,047 --> 01:36:16,367
Bend down so I can hug you.
- Do you see my car?

1055
01:36:16,767 --> 01:36:18,467
Splendid.

1056
01:36:20,947 --> 01:36:22,947
Everything okay, Théo?
- Yes.

1057
01:36:23,147 --> 01:36:25,167
Have you had a good week?

1058
01:36:25,267 --> 01:36:30,047
Can we go to the theatre?
- The theatre? Yes we will go.

1059
01:36:30,147 --> 01:36:34,272
Can we eat oysters?
- You like oysters now?

1060
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:41,387
Don't  bring him back too late.

1061
01:36:43,227 --> 01:36:45,227
Here we go.

1062
01:36:46,707 --> 01:36:51,552
Can I get in the front?
- You bet. There's no other seat.

1063
01:36:57,627 --> 01:36:59,827
We'll have our time soon.

1064
01:37:01,027 --> 01:37:03,382
How do you like it?

1065
01:37:16,627 --> 01:37:20,327
Everything okay with the team?
- Yeh, the players are okay.

1066
01:37:20,427 --> 01:37:23,274
Do you have a shower afterwards?

1067
01:37:23,374 --> 01:37:26,689
We take a shower and change clothes.

1068
01:37:26,747 --> 01:37:30,487
Do you have your pubic hair?
- No, not yet.

1069
01:37:30,627 --> 01:37:36,099
When I was young,  one of the  boys 
didn't want to undress to shower.

1070
01:37:36,307 --> 01:37:39,268
The manager wouldn't let him play.

1071
01:37:39,368 --> 01:37:42,487
So his father wanted to fight with 
the manager.

1072
01:37:42,587 --> 01:37:47,432
But he didn't do it.
The mother calmed him down.

1073
01:37:48,147 --> 01:37:52,737
Finally nobody did a thing, but
the boy quit the team.

1074
01:37:55,427 --> 01:37:57,149
Do you have that problem?

1075
01:37:57,249 --> 01:37:59,207
No, you can't shower with clothes on...

1076
01:37:59,307 --> 01:38:02,458
You tell me if you do.
- Oh,no.

1077
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:04,969
Do you have any news?
Your Mom is okay?

1078
01:38:05,069 --> 01:38:06,647
She's okay.

1079
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:10,997
You see that?
- The road to Aunt Diane's.

1080
01:38:12,027 --> 01:38:14,097
Are you feeling hot?  No?

1081
01:38:15,547 --> 01:38:17,757
No. I don't feel hot.

1082
01:38:21,347 --> 01:38:23,347
We could have...

1083
01:38:24,387 --> 01:38:26,387
We could have...

1084
01:38:36,227 --> 01:38:41,752
It's about to rain. Wait. I'll stop.
I'll stop.

1085
01:38:58,027 --> 01:39:00,416
Papa, what's wrong with you, Papa?

1086
01:39:49,867 --> 01:39:53,017
Run to the house. 
Call your Mom.

1087
01:39:54,787 --> 01:39:56,816
' My last thought was...

1088
01:39:56,916 --> 01:39:59,447
we have to cancel going to 
the theatre..

1089
01:39:59,547 --> 01:40:04,575
We'd be late in any case.
- We'll go tomorrow night.

1090
01:40:05,587 --> 01:40:08,137
Then I sank into a coma. '

1091
01:40:46,187 --> 01:40:48,303
Does this make a book?

1092
01:40:58,467 --> 01:41:01,527
For Théophile, Céleste and Hortense.

1093
01:41:01,627 --> 01:41:04,824
I wish for them many butterflies.'

1094
01:41:07,067 --> 01:41:09,967
All my thanks to 
Claude Mendibil.

1095
01:41:10,067 --> 01:41:12,617
Without her understanding...

1096
01:41:12,717 --> 01:41:15,777
this book could not have 
been written.

1097
01:41:46,067 --> 01:41:48,067
I've always been there.

1098
01:41:48,107 --> 01:41:50,107
You know it?

1099
01:41:52,547 --> 01:41:55,767
These are great reviews.
Shall I read them?

1100
01:41:55,867 --> 01:42:00,567
' The man who dictates in silence, 
Without movement or speech,...

1101
01:42:00,667 --> 01:42:02,702
Bauby learned to communicate...

1102
01:42:02,802 --> 01:42:04,967
with an eyelid to write this book.

1103
01:42:05,067 --> 01:42:08,073
An emotional trip in the 
world of loneliness...

1104
01:42:08,173 --> 01:42:10,487
which haunts the hospital of Berck. '

1105
01:42:10,587 --> 01:42:12,587
By Bernard Chapuis.

1106
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:14,667
A very emotional book.

1107
01:42:21,067 --> 01:42:23,898
' Bauby, 43 years old, 
renowned journalist,...

1108
01:42:23,998 --> 01:42:26,407
dedicated father, free man...

1109
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:31,607
aspired to write a book about 
the revenge of women...

1110
01:42:31,607 --> 01:42:34,107
' The Countess of Monte Cristo. '

1111
01:42:37,067 --> 01:42:38,720
Two days after the publication of...

1112
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:40,567
'The Diving Bell and
the Butterfly'...

1113
01:42:40,667 --> 01:42:44,626
in 1996, Jean-Dominique
Bauby died.
