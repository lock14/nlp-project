00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,928
I have been in tons of VIP rooms.
Not exactly a VIP room virgin.

172
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,408
But seriously, call me back.

173
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,670
Oh, I was just in there. Robin Scherbatsky.
I'm on the list.

174
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,139
Name's already crossed off. Sorry.

175
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:17,443
But I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
I'm a reporter for Channel 1.

176
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,773
There's a Channel 1? Back of the line.

177
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,011
Should've snuck in with Brian Affleck.

178
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,851
(EXCLAIMING)

179
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,088
Coat wench, do not uncheck
that man's jacket!

180
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,357
Sorry, I was just being dramatic.
You're not a wench.

181
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,727
No, no, no, coat wench. I like it.
I should get a sign made up.

182
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,429
Wait. What are you doing here?
Lily let you go?

183
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,565
(SCOFFING) Lily? Who cares, right?

184
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,133
- You are so dead.
- Oh, I'm so dead.

185
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,235
- Well, I'm going home.
- No!

186
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,238
I put my ass and probably other parts
of my body on the line...

187
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,107
to come down here and party with my bro.

188
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,976
- Now damn it, we're gonna party.
- All right. One beer.

189
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,176
Yes. Finally I don't have
to wait a half an hour for a drink.

190
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,056
<i>Oh, man. I can't believe
I forgot to tell you this.</i>

191
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,591
<i>This is important to the story.</i>

192
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,926
<i>Earlier that day,
Marshall went to the dentist...</i>

193
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,095
<i>and got a temporary crown put in.</i>

194
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,195
<i>Okay, so anyway...</i>

195
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,617
Marshall, are you okay?

196
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,935
<i>(PHONE RINGING)</i>

197
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:35,825
<i>OLDER TED: Again, I wasn't there,
so I'm a little foggy on the details.</i>

198
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,348
Taxi!

199
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,524
- Hey.
- Hey.

200
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,194
Marshall just ditched out on our own party.

201
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,296
Can you get me in there?
I kind of need to kill him.

202
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:54,667
Actually, I can't even get myself in.
I was such a dork.

203
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,838
I get recognized one time
and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts.

204
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,339
I'm no VIP. I'm not even an IP.

205
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:07,201
I'm just a lowly little P
sitting out here in the gutter.

206
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,547
You know something?

207
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:13,152
I'd take a P in the gutter
over Julia Roberts any day.

208
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,869
Broke my tooth.

209
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,995
Do you have any aspirin?

210
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:38,607
Maybe there's a machine in the restroom.

211
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,621
<i>Now, to this day, I don't know
what happened in there.</i>

212
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,801
<i>But when Marshall came out
a few minutes later...</i>

213
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,835
- Rough night?
- Yeah.

214
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,708
These clubs are supposed to be fun, right?
Why do I hate them so much?

215
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:14,647
Because all of the stuff
you're supposed to like, usually sucks.

216
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,215
Like these clubs. Or cruises.

217
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,949
- Or New Year's Eve.
- Or the Super Bowl.

218
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,987
- Or parades.
- The Rockettes.

219
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,093
- Or parades.
- You said that already.

220
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,991
- I really hate parades.
- Okay.

221
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:36,569
He just left in the middle of our own party.
You don't do that.

222
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,338
Unless, of course,
you're chasing after somebody...

223
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,442
who's already done it,
and then I think it's okay.

224
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,712
Well, I hate to take his side.
But, come on, a winetasting?

225
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,149
What's the big plan for next Saturday?
Scrabble night?

226
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,249
Don't check your email.

227
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,587
Why are you becoming this person?

228
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:58,290
I heard that in college you flashed
a campus tour group on a dare.

229
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,555
Once on a dare.
The other times were just for fun.

230
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,431
I'm not in college anymore.

231
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:10,202
I'd love to go back and be that person
again, but you can't move backwards.

232
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,237
- You can only go forward.
- False.

233
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,341
You can go wherever you want.

234
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,509
I guess, the question is,
where do you want to go?

235
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,746
I want to go into this club
and find my fiancé.

236
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:25,215
- Well, that you can't do.
- You wanna bet?

237
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,051
Follow my lead.

238
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,121
Hey, big guy.

239
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,160
I said, follow my lead.

240
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,062
- Yes, please, please.
- Do it, do it.

241
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,665
- Follow her lead.
- You have to. Follow it.

242
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,765
Please.

243
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:50,774
Those were the four greatest
and only breasts I have ever seen.

244
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,583
Yeah. See, if everyone keeps telling you
something is supposed to be fun,

245
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,817
it's usually not.

246
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,019
- Right.
- Right.

247
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:05,190
So by that logic, if you and I were to,
say, go out on a date...

248
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,193
Well, then we couldn't go anywhere
that's supposed to be fun.

249
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,420
Right. The DMV it is.

250
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,065
- Then we'll get our teeth cleaned.
- Sounds awful. It's a date.

251
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,133
Okay.

252
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:19,333
But there's still one big question
that needs to be answered.

253
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:25,427
How many of these coats do you think
I could put on all at once?

254
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:30,011
I'll go this way, you go that way.

255
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,045
Okay. For the wedge.

256
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,768
Barney?

257
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,971
- Barney.
- Ted.

258
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,148
- Get your coat, we're leaving.
- What?

259
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,518
What happened to that cutlet
you were grinding with?

260
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,421
- That was my cousin Leslie.
- What?

261
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,091
No. No. No.
We are not laughing about this, Ted.

262
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,595
This is not gonna be some funny story
that we'll be telling in a couple months.

263
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,331
It's not going to be like,
'Hey, remember that time...

264
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,491
'when you were grinding with...' No!

265
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,702
And you know why?

266
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,636
Because, italics,
this night did not happen.

267
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,842
And you promise me
that you will never, ever, ever tell...

268
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,311
another living soul
what transpired here tonight.

269
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,448
- You promise. Promise.
- All right, I promise.

270
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,817
Let's get Marshall and go, okay?

271
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:16,507
Hey, thanks for saving my night.
I'll taIk to you soon?

272
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,258
- Hey, tip her, Barney.
- Why? I didn't check a coat.

273
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,493
And even if I did, on principle
tip jars have become so...

274
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,495
Funny story. Barney was grinding
with this girl all night...

275
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,595
Fine!

276
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,864
Just...

277
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,125
That's a handy new trick.

278
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,918
<i>So Marshall and Lily
rediscovered their youth.</i>

279
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,018
<i>It was nice.</i>

280
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,512
<i>And then it got... icky.</i>

281
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,867
(YELLING) I'm really glad
you guys came out tonight!

282
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,508
(YELLING) You know, dude,
can I just say something?

283
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,878
It kind of hurt that you guys
didn't invite me out.

284
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,315
I mean, I know things have changed
since I got engaged,

285
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,517
but it would've been nice to be asked.

286
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:23,622
- I'm sorry! I assumed you had other plans.
- They played some good songs tonight.

287
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,426
- I mean, lately...
- I know, I know, it just, seems like...

288
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,529
suddenly we're living
in two different worlds.

289
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,698
Maybe you've got more in common
with Barney.

290
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,063
- What?
- Are you crazy?

291
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,437
You think I like going to those clubs?

292
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,707
I'd so much rather go
to your fruity little winetasting.

293
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,375
Oh, my God, I'm gonna barf!

294
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,215
Where's my purse, where's my...
No, I'm okay.

295
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,350
The problem is you can't do
any of that couple stuff...

296
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,418
unless you have someone to do it with.

297
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,054
And the only way I'm gonna find
that someone is by going out...

298
00:20:56,154 --> 00:21:00,489
- and doing stupid single stuff with Barney.
- What?

299
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,926
But, man, when I find her...

300
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,366
we're gonna have some
bad-ass winetastings.

301
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,466
It's a plan.

302
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,638
Hey, maybe it'll be that cute coat-check girl.

303
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,639
Yeah. Maybe it will be.

304
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,874
<i>It wasn't.</i>

305
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,347
You know, Ted.
I don't say this nearly enough

306
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:27,377
- but I really value...
- Hey, that place has great salads.

307
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:34,384
