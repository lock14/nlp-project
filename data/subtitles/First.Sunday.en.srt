1
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,337
I can't remember
the last time this thing worked.

2
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,038
Son, you got a gift.

3
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,773
Your man, on the other hand....

4
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,912
Do me a favor,
tonight when you close...

5
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:27,416
...double check and make sure
everything is locked.

6
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,453
Had a few things walk out of here.

7
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,717
Now, you know, Soul Joe,
I'll never steal nothing from you.

8
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,394
After everything you did for me?

9
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,826
Just keep a lookout.

10
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,595
Damn.

11
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,800
Rob from the rich
and give to myself.

12
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,772
- LeeJohn, what the hell you doing?
- Getting my money on.

13
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,775
- Man, we putting that back.
- No, we not!

14
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,572
Put it back! It's going back in.

15
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,443
You gonna get us fired?

16
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,810
Hey!

17
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,007
No-- 

18
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,786
That's my TV!

19
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,427
Somebody gonna get pregnant
tonight. That's what's up.

20
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,062
Come on, Rell, man,
that's my new joint, man.

21
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,599
- You get the job?
- Do it look like I got the job?

22
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,736
I got us a job.

23
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,739
Where?

24
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,535
You need to take the stickers off.
You ain't even never got no weed.

25
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,241
Twenty- four- inch
chrome- plated rims.

26
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:06,046
Twenty- four- inch chrome plate,
real deal.

27
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,981
Custom leather seats.

28
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,487
Custom, cush leather seat.

29
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,063
Ten chairs. Twelve- hundred dollars
apiece.

30
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,857
You do the maths.

31
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,298
You have 24 hours.

32
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:31,673
Ticktock, gunshot.

33
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,207
Bullet. Bullet.

34
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,717
Bullet, bullet, bullet.

35
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,247
You think that's 24 hours from now...

36
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,422
...or from when he said it
1 0 minutes ago?

37
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,682
Hey, is that Jamaican time
or American time?

38
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,820
What is this, man,
Pimp My Wheelchair?

39
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,257
What this is,
is us getting paid $3000...

40
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,693
...to deliver these wheelchairs
across town.

41
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,194
What the hell was that?

42
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,679
What the hell?
Why you run the light?

43
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,050
Police!

44
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,923
I ain't going back to jail, man!
I ain't going back to no jail!

45
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,292
We've got a beige van
going over Fourth Avenue.

46
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,491
Police, black man, wheelchair?
That's jail!

47
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,068
All right, don't panic. Just roll.

48
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,113
You didn't lock the back latch!
We're losing chairs!

49
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,105
Oh, man!

50
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,648
It's not my van!

51
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,877
This is my cousin Doug's.
With the one eye.

52
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,179
This is his van.

53
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,447
He said he fixed it!

54
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,199
Yo! Yo, those are our chairs, man!
They're taking our chairs!

55
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,371
Don't worry about them chairs,
just worry about them cops.

56
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,273
They coming on us! They still on us!

57
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,876
They still on us, man.
Turn right here, right here.

58
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,706
Watch out! Watch out!

59
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,460
What had happened,
it was me and LeeJohn.

60
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,458
- We was driving-- 
- Shut up.

61
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,063
- Your Honor! I was-- 
- Yo, wait-- You better shut up.

62
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,564
Wouldn't be in this damn mess
if it wasn't for you.

63
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:36,894
- For me?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:41,130
Wait a minute, now it's my fault
because I was trying to help you out?

65
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,071
- Shut the hell up.
- The both of you, shut up!

66
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:45,900
Mr. Jackson...

67
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,138
...six months ago you were caught
shoplifting at a Stop and Shop...

68
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,579
...with a box full of Ding Dongs...

69
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,582
...and a six- pack of
banana- strawberry Boone's Farm.

70
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,578
Your Honor, it was Goober Grape.

71
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,491
When the arresting officer
searched you...

72
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,853
...he found a $20 bill
in your pocket.

73
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,358
Why didn't you pay for it?

74
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,556
Because this dude named Bo Peep
was on my ass about $20 and l-- 

75
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,161
And you, Mr. Washington.

76
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,931
You scored higher on your SAT than
anyone in your graduating class...

77
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,576
...and yet you've been
in three juvenile detention centers...

78
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,871
...twice on house arrest
and once on probation.

79
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,481
A perfect example of potential
with no purpose.

80
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,208
Zero.

81
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,785
Anything either of you
have to say for yourself?

82
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,650
If I go to jail,
they're gonna make me a woman.

83
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,350
LeeJohn Jackson has been shuffled
from one foster home to another.

84
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,053
Durell Washington is the product of a
single- parented home, Your Honor...

85
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,460
...never having the benefit
of a father figure.

86
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,433
Your Honor, the youth of our city
need to be given a chance.

87
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:46,969
Yes, the youth do.

88
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,664
But with respect, Your Honor,
these are grown- ass men.

89
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,776
- What is your problem?
- You need a hobby.

90
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,606
You need another hobby
besides sending black men to jail.

91
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,942
- I'll send any man to jail I want.
- Order in the court!

92
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,979
- You better watch your language.
- My bad, Your Honor.

93
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,485
Given the record that Mr. Jackson
and Mr. Washington have earned...

94
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:12,221
...I have every right to send the both
of you to jail for a very long time.

95
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,400
- Come on, man-- 
- But I'm not gonna do that.

96
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,169
Now, I've decided to forgo
any possibility of a jail sentence...

97
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,570
...under the condition that the both
of you perform community service.

98
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,142
- I love my community.
- I got no problem with that.

99
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,973
Five thousand hours
of community service!

100
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,410
Five thousand hours?

101
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,176
Goodbye, and good riddance.

102
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,321
- Do we get paid for this?
- I ain't doing no 5000 hours, man!

103
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,490
I ain't doing no 5000 hours. Get off!

104
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,990
- I said, let go! Hell, no!
- Five thousand-- 

105
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,789
Attica! Attica!

106
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,099
Get them out of here.

107
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,343
All right, lsh Kabibble.

108
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,774
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,972
I know. I know you sorry.

110
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,172
You know how I know?

111
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,181
Because you was sorry
in kindergarten...

112
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,482
...you was sorry in elementary,
and super sorry in junior high.

113
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,182
Would've been sorry in high school,
but you never went.

114
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,055
I went to high school.
I just didn't graduate.

115
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,822
I hate you.

116
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,659
Yeah? Well, I love you.
It could always be worse, Rell.

117
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,428
Worse? What could be worse?

118
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,940
Yo, Rell, you got to walk with me
over here, man.

119
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,669
Don't leave me hanging like this.

120
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,644
- That's your problem.
- Rell-- 

121
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,248
That's your problem.

122
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,218
Don't do it.

123
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,148
Yo, Blahka.

124
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,554
Blahk? Open up, Blahk.
Hey, what's up?

125
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:52,492
My favorite buffalo soldier.
Man, we heard you was in the region.

126
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,259
Myself and Durell.
Durell is gonna come over-- Durell?

127
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,528
I'm done with criminal activity.

128
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,764
Man, he ain't gonna come over
right now, because he's preoccupied.

129
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,740
But listen, man, we was looking for
you and searching high and low, baby.

130
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,574
Twenty- four hours was up
72 hours ago.

131
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,216
But you, I know, but-- 
What had happened was that-- 

132
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,821
Ten chairs. Twelve- hundred dollars
apiece.

133
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,018
You do the maths.

134
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:26,764
Ticktock, gunshot.

135
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,024
Blahka?

136
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,427
Blahka!

137
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,940
- Who is it?
- It's me.

138
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,245
Me who? It ain't nobody that pay bills
in here. Say your name.

139
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,922
Omunique, open the door.

140
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,289
You got a damn peephole.

141
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,657
What you want?

142
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,296
Not you.

143
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,762
I came to walk my son
to the bus stop.

144
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,331
Yo, move back.

145
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,029
- Now, where's my money?
- I ain't giving you nothing.

146
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,935
- Oh, really?
- I gave you money Friday.

147
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,337
- What you do with it?
- I bought gum.

148
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,604
Don't make me file
these court papers, Rell.

149
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,974
Don't make me do it.

150
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,845
Don't make me put the man in
the middle. I promise you I will.

151
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,786
Rethink it. Dig in them pockets
and pull out something.

152
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,346
That's what I thought.

153
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,083
- Might as well be pimping. Here.
- Give me....

154
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,252
Forty dollars?
What I'm supposed to do with this?

155
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,592
What you always do with it.
Complain about it, then go spend it.

156
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,258
You know what? You come here
every day with the same thing:

157
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,666
Nothing. He don't eat air.

158
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:41,931
Well, learn how to cook.

159
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,506
We got bills up in this house.

160
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,542
Why don't you contribute, pay,
do something?

161
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,304
Hey, Dad.

162
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,947
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

163
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,209
Rell? Come say hello to your father.

164
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,913
Girl, don't play with me.

165
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,988
Hey, hey, hey. What's up, man?

166
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,024
- How you doing?
- I'm doing good.

167
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:07,325
What's up with this hair?
Look like a S.O.S. pad.

168
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,900
Tell your mama you want your hair
done as good as she do her clients.

169
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,300
And you tell your father he should
either contribute to my business...

170
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,441
...or stay out of it.

171
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,642
Shit.

172
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,643
I put in some work.

173
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,852
What up, little gangster?

174
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:34,015
Hey, hey, man.
Watch your mouth around my son.

175
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,898
- Why you sweating?
- It's hot in here.

176
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,002
I've been trying to say
it's a little stuffy up in here.

177
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:49,538
Rell, go get your backpack
for school. And comb your hair.

178
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,436
Hey, what are you doing?

179
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,844
Fixing your raggedy- ass thermostat
before my son dies of heat stroke.

180
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,950
Anyway....

181
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,679
I'm thinking about moving down South
to Atlanta with my grandmother.

182
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,120
You out your rabid- ass mind?
You ain't taking my son nowhere.

183
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,151
What you say?

184
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,192
Listen, my lease is up on the shop.

185
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,628
The owner got somebody
to pay a year in advance...

186
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:19,032
...so unless you got $1 7,342,
I gotta go.

187
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,105
Why you can't do hair out
your house like you been doing?

188
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,573
I can't run an entire salon
out of my house, Durell.

189
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,911
I got equipment, I got employees.

190
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,308
You got clients.

191
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,142
And I got goals.

192
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,411
Durell, I was two stylists away
from filling up my shop.

193
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,617
I'm tired of struggling.

194
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,388
I'm tired of our son
watching me struggle.

195
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:45,587
I don't want to take Rell away from
you, but I gotta do what's best for him.

196
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,997
And I gotta do what's best for me.

197
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,225
What's best for him
is to be with his father.

198
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,425
Really?

199
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,902
What about what's best for me?
Or does that even matter to you, ever?

200
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,506
No, it don't.

201
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,303
Because you not my responsibility
no more, he is.

202
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,207
Why are you always doing this to me?

203
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,143
I'm not raising the next man's kid,
I'm raising your son!

204
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,875
- Your son.
- You keep your ass out of it, okay?

205
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,519
Stop disrespecting my clients!

206
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,951
Sit there and worry about getting
your hair burnt.

207
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,751
What you need to do is stand up
there and burn a job out.

208
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,085
That's what you need.

209
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,693
- Stop.
- I'll pull a track out.

210
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,263
You ain't gonna pull out nothing.
Not up in here, you ain't. I'm good.

211
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,127
Your client's disrespecting me.

212
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,359
Don't talk about her weave.
That's her hair.

213
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,630
Listen, I'm asking you right-- 

214
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,335
Baby, hey.

215
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:35,176
Come give me a hug.
You got your bags?

216
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,112
You gonna have a good day
at school?

217
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,944
Give me a soul kiss?

218
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,152
- I love you.
- Love you too.

219
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,354
You think he can fix the cable too?

220
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,620
No, why don't you fix the cable?

221
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,058
How you gonna ask another man
to fix the cable?

222
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,321
He fixed the air.

223
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,159
Old boy up there, he don't
be messing with you, do he?

224
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:59,497
No, he just sleeps all day, you know,
since the cable stopped working.

225
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:03,038
Yeah. Man, your mama
sure know how to pick them.

226
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,211
She picked you,
I mean, you weren't so bad.

227
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,870
What you mean, I wasn't so bad?
Don't be pushing on me, boy.

228
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,674
- You know I'm B- mo's finest?
- Yes.

229
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,513
Am I B- mo's finest? All right, then.
Let it be known. All right.

230
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,188
Okay, okay.

231
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,193
You ever finish that report on what
you want to be when you grow up?

232
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:25,488
Yeah, I wanna be
like LeBron James.

233
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,357
You and every other little kid
in the 'hood.

234
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,332
Just in case that don't work...

235
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:37,202
...not saying it won't, but if it don't,
you gotta have a plan B.

236
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,138
What's a plan B?

237
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,146
A plan B is like a backup plan
if your original plan don't work.

238
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:49,310
Okay. So, what's your plan B?

239
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,682
My plan B....

240
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,054
My plan B is...

241
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,219
...to make sure your peanut head
get on the bus on time every morning.

242
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,489
That's my plan A and B.

243
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,997
Dad, you need a plan C.

244
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,567
You need to get on that bus.

245
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,765
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

246
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,806
I know what my plan B is.

247
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,946
- What?
- It's to be just like you.

248
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,611
I want you to promise me something.

249
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,480
Promise me you'll be better than me.

250
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,322
- I want you to promise something too.
- What?

251
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,255
Please don't let Mom take me
to Atlanta.

252
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,928
Please?

253
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,658
Oh, man, don't worry about that, man.
Ain't nobody gonna take you nowhere.

254
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,172
All right, man.
Go on and make your bus.

255
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,881
Yeah, come on, Rell!

256
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,924
Get your lazy ass up.
Let's go to work!

257
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,797
Let's go, Rell, come on!
Get the molasses out your ass!

258
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,003
Seventeen thousand, three hundred
and forty- two dollars in a month?

259
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,303
Because she wants you
to pay her bills?

260
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,203
Selfish.

261
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,641
And she know damn well
I can't leave the state.

262
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:26,274
By the time I see my son again, he
gonna be graduated from high school.

263
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,312
There's always college.

264
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,488
You really don't care
somebody's trying to kill us?

265
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,593
Us? They're trying to kill you.

266
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,026
Now, this was your idea, remember?
I don't even know these dudes.

267
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,599
You got your ass in it,
you can get your ass out of it.

268
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:47,499
Matter of fact, all I'm really worried
about is getting 1 7 G's...

269
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,640
...so my son don't have
to move to Atlanta.

270
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,868
You see that whole conversation there
that came out of your mouth?

271
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,477
Selfish.

272
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,514
Yeah, that's me. Selfish.

273
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,646
Crenshaw. Crenshaw.

274
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,048
What?

275
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,351
May I have three slices of lemon...

276
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,188
...four packs of sugar
and a tall glass of ice water?

277
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,523
With no attitude.

278
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:13,993
So one lemonade?

279
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,826
Well, let me rephrase it for you...

280
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,765
...I know you was in special ed
and I'm gonna forgive you...

281
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,439
...but I would like
three free slices of lemon...

282
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:26,875
...four free packs of sugar
and a tall glass of free ice water.

283
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,043
And it's called baby hair
because it's for babies.

284
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,582
You know what? I got some more
baby hair, wanna see it?

285
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,848
You shouldn't have
never messed with that girl.

286
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,193
Durell, get down.

287
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,691
It's Blahka, man.

288
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,523
- It's Blahka.
- So?

289
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,029
I know where
we can get the money from.

290
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,929
- Who?
- Mordecai.

291
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,867
He gives out loans at a massage shop
in the west side of Baltimore.

292
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,237
I can get the money I need and
you can get the money you need.

293
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,070
Hi, how are you?

294
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,916
You speak my language.
We're here to see Mordecai.

295
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,284
Our Swedish massages
start at 49.50.

296
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,327
We need to talk to Mordecai,
we trying to get a loan here.

297
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,795
So, what sort of massage will it be?

298
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,559
Didn't you hear me?

299
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,570
Let me speak to you over here
for a minute.

300
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,935
That's the code, man. Damn, relax.

301
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,474
We came here to get a loan.

302
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,407
And I'm getting a massage.

303
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,604
- Are you coming or not?
- Not.

304
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:50,851
Let's go, baby.

305
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,117
You like Minnie Riperton?
I love Minnie Riperton.

306
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,796
- Yo, LeeJohn?
- I save that for special occasions.

307
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,226
Hey, LeeJohn?

308
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,167
Hey, yo, LeeJohn, we need
to find Mordecai and get out of here.

309
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,216
God.

310
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,049
Hey, man, let's go.

311
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,285
My name is LeeJohn Jackson,
and I'm a Leo.

312
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,158
King of the jungle.

313
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,128
Do you wanna know my name?

314
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,929
I just don't want to know your name,
I want you to whisper it in my ear.

315
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,900
Mordecai.

316
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,482
Bitches, help me! Shit.

317
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,324
That's a man, dog! LeeJohn!
That's a man!

318
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,289
I won't tell if you don't tell!

319
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,520
Don't bring your ass around here
unless you ready to borrow money!

320
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,722
Playing with my emotions.

321
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,636
Hey, yo, about last night?

322
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,441
About the fact that you was
enjoying that massage, by a man?

323
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,882
Hey, Durell, I was not enjoying
no massage by no nasty-- 

324
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:01,417
Just because a man sings a slow jam
while another man's massaging him...

325
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,390
...does not mean he was enjoying it.

326
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,621
- What does it mean?
- I'm in love with Minnie Riperton.

327
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,766
That song touches
a sensitive side of me...

328
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,401
...so I wanted to share it
with other men.

329
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,429
Hey, man! Yo, homey!
Yo, that could be one of our chairs!

330
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,630
No, not today.

331
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,400
- We gonna get creamed-- 
- Not today.

332
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,599
That's our chair.

333
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,608
- Don't worry about that chair.
- Blahka!

334
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,214
That's what you need
to be worrying about. That right there.

335
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,244
Now let the church say amen.

336
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,512
Or a- woman.

337
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,020
Hey there, Beige.

338
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,156
That's what I'm talking about.

339
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,523
See, now, that's the reason why I sing.

340
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,428
Yo, LeeJohn, where you going?

341
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,762
I'm gonna meet me
a Mary Magdalene!

342
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,836
- Get your ass out of the street.
- Wait.

343
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,974
Man, you better get back over here.

344
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,303
LeeJohn! Yo, LeeJohn!

345
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,368
Wait for me.

346
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,622
Durell, man, this is like Club Jesus.

347
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,492
And they got a open bar.
Look at this.

348
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,643
VlP.

349
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,448
In the cheap seats? Come on, man,
this is the Rosa Parks section.

350
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,053
You remind me of my uncle, man,
his name was Tom.

351
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,182
My knee.

352
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,072
Hey, y'all got Cheez Whiz?

353
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,241
I don't know what goes on in church.
I've never been.

354
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,575
You have a three- drink minimum?

355
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,111
I'm getting tore up from the floor up.

356
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,957
These people be feeling it.

357
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,399
The presence of the Lord...

358
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,194
...is here.

359
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,139
Hallelujah.

360
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,541
I would like all of our visitors here
in the church today to please stand.

361
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,814
- Right now.
- Welcome.

362
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,488
- That's all right.
- Welcome to the house of the Lord.

363
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,350
Y'all know,
the first time, you're a visitor...

364
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,151
...the next time, you're family.

365
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,852
Hallelujah. Welcome, sugar.

366
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,926
See, y'all visiting today, so y'all
may not know here at First Hope...

367
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,864
...we don't believe in last hope,
amen?

368
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,836
When you go for three months
without paying your electric bill.

369
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,207
And you hope they don't cut you off.

370
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,176
Say it now, preacher, say it!

371
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,043
I'm talking about you, Sister Baker.

372
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,017
You need to just slow down, baby.

373
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:04,455
Over the last year and a half,
we've raised almost $230,000.

374
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,358
- Say amen, church.
- Yes!

375
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,556
Bingo. Yahtzee.

376
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,871
Which, as you know...

377
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:22,035
...we are considering using
to build a new sanctuary...

378
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,875
...in a less....

379
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,381
- Urban.
- Congested neighborhood.

380
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,580
He's using big words now.
Sanctuary. Congested. That means....

381
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,258
- The ghetto.
- Ghetto. Yeah.

382
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:38,862
Oh, no, sugar. Right here, right here.
It's all right, right here.

383
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,429
Ain't nothing wrong.

384
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,567
Oh, Lord, my husband's
turning over in his grave.

385
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,828
Even if we don't move,
even if we stay right here...

386
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,399
...we still need some more money...

387
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,669
...to help us with these costly repairs
and improvements here in the church.

388
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,814
Like central air, for one thing.

389
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,911
So I'm calling on you because
we need your help.

390
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,385
Anybody in the church this morning
who's got $1 00 hope...

391
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,558
...stand to your feet right now.

392
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,189
Don't stand up if you ain't got it.

393
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,956
- That's a lot of $1 00 hope up in here.
- I'm getting them on camera phone.

394
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,032
Now, Malachi 3 and Verse 8,
it asks a simple question.

395
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:21,171
Will a man rob God?

396
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,705
Hundred dollar down to
a penny with a hole in it...

397
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,705
...stand to your feet right now.

398
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,942
Now, I want you all
to turn to your neighbor.

399
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,015
- Get some of these people-- 
- Look your neighbor in the eye...

400
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,482
...and say to him or her...

401
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,679
...the same thing that was said
over a thousand years ago.

402
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,983
- Will a man...
- Will a man...

403
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,355
- ...rob God?
- ...rob God?

404
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,789
I'm not robbing no church, man.

405
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,023
Would you-- ?

406
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,792
Ain't anybody talking about
robbing no church.

407
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,302
I'm talking about robbing
the people in the church.

408
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,407
Like they ain't never
done nothing wrong.

409
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,238
I remember one time, my foster mother
took me into a street service...

410
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:05,143
...and they was giving out free food
to people who was getting baptized.

411
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,012
And just because I wasn't getting
baptized, I couldn't eat.

412
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,483
- And I couldn't swim.
- Okay, get over it.

413
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,589
How many times
you gonna tell this story?

414
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,985
A million more!

415
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,352
Get over it.

416
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:21,994
Look, that is God's money,
and God do not want Blahka to kill us.

417
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:27,001
LeeJohn, I'm not robbing
no damn church.

418
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,695
All right, don't rob the church.

419
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:32,809
But when Durell Jr. is in Atlanta calling
some big, ugly black dude "Daddy"...

420
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,035
...don't be mad at me.

421
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,304
Watch your mouth.
My son ain't going nowhere.

422
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,414
I'll come across this table
on you, boy.

423
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,141
It ain't the first time
you came across the table on me.

424
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,547
- Won't be the last time.
- I'm telling the truth.

425
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,223
Now you wanna
explode in violence?

426
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:50,919
Yeah?

427
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,756
Durell, I'm leaving next week.

428
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,761
Next week?
What happened to next month?

429
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,129
Landlord said I have to have the
money by next week. I don't have it.

430
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,803
Do you?

431
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,570
- No.
- Of course you don't.

432
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,539
Now where you gonna get
the money from?

433
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,091
Record your message
after the tone.

434
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,231
Hey, Dad, it's me. You promised.

435
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,402
You promised that you won't
let Mom take me to Atlanta.

436
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,197
I love you. I gotta go. Bye.

437
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,676
Everybody and their mother
thought they was gonna win.

438
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,870
Well, you tell Scott when I get
his money I will give it to him.

439
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,345
Okay? He can't get what I ain't got.

440
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:47,742
Right.

441
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,183
I'm in.

442
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,188
Let me call you right back.
I'll call you right back.

443
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,951
Look, now, all we got to do...

444
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,359
...is get to whoever got the money
before they get to the bank.

445
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,897
No. We ain't letting the money
get out.

446
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,093
We gonna get it while it's still in there.
Tonight.

447
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,569
That's what I was saying.
We gonna go get the money tonight.

448
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,435
Before it walks out of there.

449
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,191
- Yes.
- Through here.

450
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,735
I don't care about that goddamn pole,
man. Let's go.

451
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,005
Wait, I see something.

452
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,048
Put that damn thing down.
Let's go.

453
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,383
That scared the hell out of me.

454
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,467
Come on, man.

455
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:14,865
Come on, D.

456
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:19,134
D? Let's go, baby.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

457
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,574
What the hell you doing?
What the hell you doing?

458
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,577
- Why you got that in my face?
- Just trying to....

459
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,250
Man, you're so dumb sometimes.

460
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,919
Damn. I broke it.

461
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,382
Durell, that's a sign, man.
That's a omen, man.

462
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,617
Things happen for a reason, Durell.

463
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,456
The universe
is starting to speak to us.

464
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,995
We can go that way.

465
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,198
I'm not climbing up there.
I'm not Spider- Man.

466
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,870
- And I'm not scaling no wall.
- Who plan was this?

467
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,040
This was my plan, but I ain't
said nothing about scaling no wall.

468
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,334
No. No. No, Durell, no.

469
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:56,775
Ten wheelchairs, 1 200 apiece.
You do the math.

470
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,111
Kiss my ass, Rell.

471
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,547
Don't bust your ass.

472
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,666
Who the hell you looking for?

473
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,805
- I ain't see you.
- I'm standing right here.

474
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,236
- I gotcha.
- All right. You gotta stop tweaking.

475
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,910
Get it together.
LeeJohn, get it together.

476
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,578
- Okay.
- Come on.

477
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,410
Hurry up.

478
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,753
That's my knee.

479
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,755
Mother- fletcher.

480
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,336
- Hey, Durell?
- What?

481
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,907
- He keep looking at me.
- Who?

482
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,571
White Jesus.

483
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,942
No matter where I go...

484
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,848
...the eyes go with me.

485
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,286
White Jesus!

486
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,827
Damn.

487
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,325
What happened?

488
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:23,056
My grandmama done gave 31 G's
to this church.

489
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,565
We should've robbed her ass.

490
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,470
- Hey, D?
- What?

491
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,509
You think there's really a hell?

492
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:39,342
Because I'm not a bad person.
I just be in bad situations.

493
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:44,080
You know what it is? My foster mother
used to beat me too much.

494
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,550
She used to come in and say:

495
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:49,090
"I'm gonna beat you till candy
come out. I'm gonna beat you till-- "

496
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,126
- What's this?
- Pastor's study.

497
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,373
Lock that door.

498
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,754
- Yo, Durell?
- What?

499
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,754
They doing the same thing.
Look at the eyes.

500
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,031
Don't worry about them pictures.

501
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,834
I didn't kill the dream.

502
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,657
Jackpot.

503
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,395
- Pot- jack. That's good work, homeboy.
- For shizzle.

504
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,106
We ain't got time for that.

505
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,301
- Be careful. Don't blow us up.
- Let's get this guap.

506
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,782
Man, you know that ain't
no damn cherry bomb. Come on.

507
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,379
You know what you doing?

508
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,852
- lf you blow us up, boy, I'll-- 
- Hit the deck!

509
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,292
Get your head down.

510
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,496
Try it again.

511
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,040
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I know what I'm doing.

512
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,080
Keep your mouth shut
and you won't get shot!

513
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,717
- Oh, my-- 
- Open up that safe.

514
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,012
What safe?

515
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,950
- That safe.
- Oh, man.

516
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,454
Still ain't open, man!

517
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,127
- All right, give me the combination.
- I don't know-- 

518
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,796
- Don't get cute, Pink!
- I don't know the combination!

519
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,488
You got the key,
but you don't know the combination?

520
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,894
Don't lie to me.

521
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,830
What are you doing?

522
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,370
Come here! Look, man.
What the hell wrong with you?

523
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,439
You know this is your plan?
You remember?

524
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,372
Not to put a grown- ass man
in time- out, it wasn't!

525
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,742
I'm climbing out that window,
and I'm jumping off that fire escape...

526
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,407
...and I'm gonna boogie- woogie
my black ass out of here, right now!

527
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,144
No, you ain't. No, you-- 

528
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,986
- Who is that?
- Don't know.

529
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,625
All right, Pink.
You know what I got in my pocket?

530
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,886
All right, get over here.
Open that door.

531
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,564
- Deacon?
- Okay, okay.

532
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:18,201
Why is this door locked, Deacon?
Oh, you have company.

533
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,869
Timmy, sit down over there.

534
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,266
Well, no smoking in the church.

535
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:24,863
Sorry.

536
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,544
I'm Doris McPherson,
the church secretary...

537
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,076
...and this is my son, Timmy.

538
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,748
Timmy, stop all that jumping.
Stop, stop.

539
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,980
And you are?

540
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,354
- Leonard.
- Leonard.

541
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,782
Leonard.

542
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,457
You're both named Leonard?

543
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,794
Yeah, but we say it differently.

544
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:49,729
It's a family tradition that both
the boy cousins is named Leonard.

545
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,958
Interesting.

546
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,466
The pastor would like
you to come to the meeting...

547
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,901
...so that we can get started
and leave early.

548
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,066
He'd also like you to bring
the financial records, okay? All right.

549
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,905
Timmy, come on. Baby, come on.

550
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,274
Very nice meeting you, Leonard.
Leonard.

551
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,151
Please bring the records now,
Deacon.

552
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,149
Who else is here?

553
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,822
- Everybody.
- Everybody?

554
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,652
Get over here.
Open that safe, right now!

555
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,195
Could you come now? Deacon?

556
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,161
- Let's leave right now!
- Shut up. Open.

557
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,459
If I don't go,
they're gonna keep coming back.

558
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,604
That's why we should be out of here.
Let's take flight!

559
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,433
- Deacon? The pastor, he's waiting.
- Come on, let's go.

560
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,175
Congregations move all the time,
Tianna. It's called progress.

561
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,814
No, Daddy, it's called profit...

562
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,849
...which is why the deacon
is always trying to get us to move.

563
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,952
Don't do that. Let me tell you,
you blow that bugle one more time...

564
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,627
...you hear,
Jesus himself gonna have to come...

565
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,126
...and get off the cross and save you,
you hear me?

566
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,526
Come on, baby,
just sit where you always sit.

567
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,724
- You find the deacon?
- He's behind me.

568
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,563
I told him to come,
we been here all day, everybody tired.

569
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,204
Stop with the imaginary friends.

570
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,068
- Slow down.
- Okay, relax. I'll do whatever you say.

571
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,368
Here's what we gonna do.

572
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,307
You go in there and you answer
whatever question they got...

573
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,539
...excuse yourself,
and then we gonna ease on out.

574
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,617
They ask who we are, we here
to fix the church, you got that?

575
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,050
Do you got this? Okay.

576
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,122
That is the most crackish idea ever.

577
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,987
What, more crackish
than selling wheelchairs?

578
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,493
I don't know yet.

579
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,497
But they don't know us.
They gonna know something's wrong.

580
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,532
The only way they gonna know
something...

581
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,467
...is if you act like something
is wrong, so don't.

582
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,942
Something is wrong!

583
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,339
- Oh, there he is.
- Oh, well, Deacon.

584
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,838
How gracious of you to return.

585
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,380
Tianna, don't start now.

586
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,953
Everyone, this is Leonard.
And this is....

587
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,180
- Leonard.
- So both of y'all named Leonard?

588
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,291
It's a family tradition.

589
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,724
All of the first boy cousins
are named Leonard.

590
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,363
Yeah, and they're doing some work
on the church...

591
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,125
...so I'm gonna straighten them out
and be right back.

592
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,166
I hope you work
on this air conditioning.

593
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,431
It's hotter than four sisters in a phone
booth with G- strings on, that's hot.

594
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,201
Why would we do work
on the old church?

595
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,938
I mean, we're obviously just gonna
move to a new church, right, Deacon?

596
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,979
That decision hasn't been made.
Hold on.

597
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,913
I thought the deacon had
already made that decision for you.

598
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,789
And for me. Oh, well,
and for all of us, actually.

599
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,153
Momma T, did you know that
the deacon cast your vote?

600
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,261
- Were you aware?
- You cast her vote?

601
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,555
No.

602
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,892
You mean that you let him
cast your vote and not cast mine?

603
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,663
Darling, I would never let anybody
take our voices away.

604
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,533
Lord have mercy.

605
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:44,833
What is this about?

606
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:49,570
Well, Momma T, that's
not entirely true, I didn't do that.

607
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,611
The money that we raise...

608
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:55,013
...should be used to fund
outreach programs in this community.

609
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,847
Yes, and a foster- care center
would be nice.

610
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,615
A convalescent home,
after- school programs.

611
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,759
The church
should inspire the community.

612
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,293
What about folks that walk to church
and can't afford transportation?

613
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,864
Maybe moving the church
will inspire them to get a job...

614
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,194
...so that they can
afford some transportation.

615
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,268
- Deacon.
- I thought we hadn't decided...

616
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,497
...whether we were gonna
move the church.

617
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:17,696
You know what?

618
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:21,366
I thought the same thing,
until I found these...

619
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,441
...on my daddy's desk.

620
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,886
Those are ideas, Pastor.

621
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:35,024
Just, you know, possibilities in case
we all voted to move the church.

622
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,557
I'm trying to be prepared.

623
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,388
Arthur, is this true?

624
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,867
As I told my inquisitive daughter....

625
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,003
- Nosy daughter.
- Deacon.

626
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:50,970
Momma T, I haven't made
any decision yet, okay?

627
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,234
That's why we're meeting here
this evening.

628
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,639
Right, and I wanna participate
but I have some-- 

629
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,213
Look, right there. He's planning
to put an ATM right in the church.

630
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,405
-- will be right back.

631
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,882
Well, you can't do any business yet.

632
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,315
Why not, lady? We gotta go.

633
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,356
Because we haven't prayed yet,
and we need to pray on this.

634
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,548
Lord have mercy.

635
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,194
Like my late husband
used to always say:

636
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,660
"Man should always pray
and not faint."

637
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,332
Luke's 1 8:1.

638
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,128
I don't mean to disrespect
your husband, Luke 1 8 and 1...

639
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,361
...but is he gonna help us
with this drywall?

640
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,040
Because I got to get these tools
off the truck.

641
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:27,142
Oh, he's so funny, don't you think?

642
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,943
You gentlemen...

643
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,676
...will join us in a moment of prayer,
won't you?

644
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,943
Everybody join hands.
Take his hand, Timmy.

645
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:37,876
Arthur.

646
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:40,581
Precious Father....

647
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,782
Precious Father

648
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,860
We need you now

649
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,029
We come to you this evening...

650
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,860
...thankful for yet another opportunity
to join as one.

651
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,298
Thankful for you today, right now

652
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,972
You said, where two
are gathered in your name...

653
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,731
Matthew's 1 8:20.

654
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:58,931
...there you'd be.

655
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,371
Thank you, Jesus.

656
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:05,072
We ask today that you not only
speak to our minds and our hearts....

657
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,476
Or our wallets.

658
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:11,280
Lord, pray for all the parents that keep
bringing their babies down here...

659
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:15,288
...to get baptized,
without giving them a hot bath.

660
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:19,394
Last time, there was a ring around the
pool, and Brother Bertware got gout.

661
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,097
But also to our purpose.

662
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:25,462
Yes, and speaking of that, please,
everybody...

663
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,796
...please pray for Sister Cora.

664
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:32,840
Pray for her, she got her head stuck
between the doors at Walgreens.

665
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,102
She was trying to change the station...

666
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,678
...on her iPod
her grandbabies bought her.

667
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,280
What a gift. What a gift.

668
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,144
We also seek your guidance today...

669
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,946
...so that we seek your will
and not ours.

670
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,088
- Or the deacon's.
- Or Tianna's.

671
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,281
All these things we ask....

672
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,858
In Jesus' name-- 
Let's get to work. -- amen.

673
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,858
Amen.

674
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,125
All right, I gotta go. I love you.
Gotta go home.

675
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,934
It's first Sunday. They not supposed
to rehearse till second Sunday.

676
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,663
- Well, they can't rehearse tonight.
- Why not?

677
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:07,173
Because it's just not a good night.
I'll be right back.

678
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,973
I'm gonna construct some construction
that needs to be constructed.

679
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,705
Exactly what I was talking about.

680
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,975
Wait, Tianna, hold on.
Why can't they-- ?

681
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,676
You're supposed to be singing
from your diaphragm.

682
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,618
And you are singing from somewhere
you have pain and anger.

683
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:21,813
We don't need that.

684
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,288
Why are you singling me out?

685
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,156
I'm not singling you out,
you are singling yourself out.

686
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:29,230
You can't be Deniece Williams,
you can't be a black butterfly.

687
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,163
- Somebody got to be a moth or one-- 
- Rickey, excuse me.

688
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,461
-- like a flying roach.

689
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,968
- Rickey.
- You not supposed to.

690
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,833
- You supposed to be the-- 
- Excuse me.

691
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,339
- Yes, may I help you?
- You can't meet here tonight.

692
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:42,410
Really? That's kind of interesting,
because I am here tonight.

693
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,513
- Why I can't be here?
- You can't meet...

694
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,148
...because we're meeting here.

695
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,148
You know what, is there a problem?
Is this personal?

696
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,150
I am the deacon here,
and you need to-- 

697
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,756
The problem, Rickey, is that he's
always trying to control everything.

698
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,392
That's exactly what his problem is.
Back to y'all.

699
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,562
One, two, three, four.

700
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,855
Excuse me!

701
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:06,963
Excuse me, man.

702
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,932
Excuse you?
Don't nobody even know you.

703
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,734
Come on, let's sing.
They letting strangers just walk in.

704
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:15,537
- How you doing?
- Good, thank you. Right, here we go.

705
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,506
- What's over there?
- I'm about to do something.

706
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,742
- What you about to do?
- Just go over there and sit.

707
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,613
Daddy, can I talk to you in private?

708
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,254
Hey there, Leonard.

709
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,053
-- replacement.
He is the head deacon.

710
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,590
Everybody! Shut the hell up!

711
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,022
All that construction
has poor Leonard on edge.

712
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,192
First of all, my name ain't Leonard.

713
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,731
- lt ain't?
- No.

714
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,596
- You Leonard?
- I'm still Leonard.

715
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:40,792
All right, Leonard.

716
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:45,031
Second of all, we didn't come
to repair this church.

717
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,231
We came to rob it.

718
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:49,139
Is this some sort of a joke, sir?
Nobody has time for this.

719
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:50,608
I'm gonna need everybody....

720
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,146
Who are these two clowns
you brought in here?

721
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,547
You have to tell us what's going on.

722
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:08,127
- Where you going? Get off of me!
- They won't shoot the baby.

723
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,400
Durell, you better get down,
somebody got a gun.

724
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:22,443
That's me with the gun, fool. Get up.

725
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:27,717
You got a gun?

726
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,909
In the church?

727
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,048
God gonna whip your ass!

728
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:34,588
Go lock all the doors.

729
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,955
Now, we didn't come here
to hurt nobody, but we will.

730
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,562
All we want is the money.

731
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:44,461
Take your two- ways,
cell phones, beepers...

732
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,762
...anything you got that beep, buzz
or get on my nerves...

733
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,029
...put it in the basket.

734
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:54,336
Drop it in the bucket.
Save yourself a trip to the hospital.

735
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,579
Now, we gonna take this deacon
to the back.

736
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,045
He gonna open up this safe
and we gonna get out.

737
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,115
Simple and plain.

738
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,614
- Oh, my God!
- What's wrong with him?

739
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,621
Get your ass back!

740
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,624
The hell wrong with you?

741
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,159
You sure you wanna do that?

742
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:17,231
Look around you. You're not gonna
get away with this. This is a church.

743
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,835
I'm gonna get away with it,
just like you been getting away with it.

744
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,335
Selling hope.

745
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,599
Take his ass to the back,
he gonna open up this safe...

746
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,401
...and we gonna walk out that door.

747
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,671
And I'm gonna hope
I don't have to pull this trigger.

748
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,050
I can tell you gonna be trouble.

749
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,517
We need to sit you down.

750
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,191
We've seen your faces,
and that's not good.

751
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,797
But perhaps...

752
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,528
...I can somehow persuade the others
to let the two of you just walk out...

753
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:58,731
...and we can pretend this never
happened. But if I open this safe....

754
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:03,976
Never mind.

755
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,164
- It's gone.
- Gone?

756
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:24,425
Who would steal money
from a church?

757
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:31,804
- What?
- See, this is exactly why...

758
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,500
...I wanted to move the church
out of this community.

759
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,440
To avoid this type of thing.

760
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,615
This has nothing to do
with the community.

761
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,375
This has everything to do
with these two fools here.

762
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,452
These two fools are the community.

763
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,619
Hold up. What's he talking about?
Who you calling "fool," chump?

764
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,918
The two fools
waving a gun in a church.

765
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,494
Don't call the two Leonards "fools."

766
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,426
I told you my name ain't Leonard.

767
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,567
- What is your name?
- I'm LeeJohn and that's Durell.

768
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,100
Oh, LeeJohn.

769
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,566
Leonard!

770
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,872
You just told them our real names.

771
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,399
Come back over here and sit down.

772
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:12,240
All right, one thing I do know,
whoever stole that money...

773
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,077
...is still up in here, right now.

774
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,479
Who's to say?

775
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,053
Was the safe broken into? No.

776
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,656
Is the money missing? Yeah.

777
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:24,793
Yet everybody that got the
combination is sitting right here...

778
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:28,362
...on the same night the money come
up missing. Ain't that a coincidence?

779
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,590
Leonard? Leonard!

780
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:34,595
Leonard! You and your crazy logic!

781
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,706
Now, how you know they the only
ones that know the combination?

782
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:41,608
Ain't nobody meeting on the money
and how to spend it...

783
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,372
...unless they know where it is.
Simple.

784
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,718
We certainly don't have it.
None of us. We just got here.

785
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:54,015
You should point this at whoever's
been here since the 1 :00 service.

786
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,283
Hanging around-- 
We certainly wasn't in here.

787
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,190
I was not gonna be in somebody's
meeting sweating my perm out...

788
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,228
...Iong as it take me
under some irons.

789
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:06,232
This is not even my church.
I saw this on MySpace.

790
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,165
I'm just not a good hostage in a-- 

791
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:11,739
Since nobody left the church,
that mean the money is still here.

792
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,706
So one of y'all either got it
or know where it is.

793
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:19,643
So we ain't leaving until we find it.
Now is the time to start snitching.

794
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,942
You know something?

795
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,210
If you didn't have that gun,
I'd come over-- 

796
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,411
Tianna. Hush.

797
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,591
I wanna see Jesus too,
but I don't wanna see him tonight.

798
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,221
Whose phone is that?

799
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,090
Who got a phone?
Didn't I tell you to put it in the basket?

800
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,857
That's probably Jesse Jackson
calling to free me.

801
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,064
That's your phone.

802
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,234
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Dad.

803
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,174
My PSP just stopped working.

804
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,072
Handle this.

805
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,252
- Handle what?
- Just sit there and hold that.

806
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,011
What, that?

807
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,657
Why there always got to be
a sidebar with you? Here.

808
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,566
- When's the last time you charged it?
- Last night.

809
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,431
Try turning it over
and just take the battery out.

810
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:16,795
Okay.

811
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,599
Wipe off the battery terminal...

812
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,678
...but not with your hand, okay?

813
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,471
All right.

814
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:27,808
It's his son.

815
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,021
Try it again.

816
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,413
It's working.

817
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,420
I gotta go. I love you, Dad.

818
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,296
I love you too.

819
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,065
I'm sick of this bullshit.

820
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,676
I need to know where this money
is right now!

821
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,404
Please, have some respect
for the house of the Lord.

822
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,809
I gotta use the bathroom!

823
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,779
Okay, let these people
finish robbing.

824
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:05,614
- I gotta use it now!
- Shut him up.

825
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:08,347
Why don't you just let the boy
go to the bathroom?

826
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,185
Just mind your own business.

827
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:14,124
You might as well let him pee
because he's gonna pee regardless.

828
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,559
I was watching him earlier.

829
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,290
He hadn't been drinking water,
so it's probably ammonia.

830
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:21,630
You don't want that strong smell.
I'm gonna take him to the house...

831
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,272
...and make sure he's hydrated
and get juice in him.

832
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,907
I'll bring him right back here.

833
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:28,839
And I'm gonna get Momma T,
I saw what you had for breakfast.

834
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,444
I know you probably bubbling.

835
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,275
LeeJohn, take that little boy
to the bathroom.

836
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,543
I'm not gonna let anybody take
my Timmy to the bathroom.

837
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:39,119
Well, then let him pee in your purse.

838
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,584
Sit down!

839
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,021
Okay, the double doors.
The first door on the left.

840
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:49,255
Make sure you jiggle the handle after
you use it because it'll make noise.

841
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:50,899
Go ahead, Timmy, go on.

842
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:55,227
Why do I have to take him
to the bathroom?

843
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,303
I gotta figure out
who got this money.

844
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,442
Why don't you take him and
let me figure out who got the money?

845
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,373
Wait a minute, this is my idea.

846
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,570
Why do you
always gotta give the orders?

847
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:07,306
- You wanna give orders now?
- Please don't let him.

848
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,950
- I might.
- All right.

849
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,779
We got church people held hostage.

850
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,785
The money we came to steal?
Somebody stole it.

851
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,959
They done seen our faces and
because of you, they know our names.

852
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,253
LeeJohn and Durell.

853
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:24,331
See? So, what you suggest, huh?

854
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,297
You the smart one now.

855
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,599
And make sure
you jiggle the handle too.

856
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:41,111
Tuck your shirt in so I can
take you back to your moms, man.

857
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,309
She ain't my mama!

858
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,346
What you mean,
she ain't your moms?

859
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,558
This is my mom and this is me.

860
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:58,862
She said she's coming back to get me.
Least, that's what she said.

861
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,867
Yeah, well...

862
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:08,274
...until she do,
tuck your shirt in your pants.

863
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:16,348
Boy, nobody never teach you how
to tuck your shirt in your pants?

864
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,077
No.

865
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,952
You know, that's all right.
Nobody never taught me either.

866
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:26,620
But this how you do,
you put the left in first.

867
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,024
Why?

868
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:31,799
Well, I don't know.
Who's doing the tucking?

869
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,798
Put your left in first...

870
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,170
...then you put your right in.
Let me see you do it.

871
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,810
Yep.

872
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,680
Yeah, that's it.

873
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,983
Why don't somebody tell them where
the money is so we can go home?

874
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,654
You know, Leonard...

875
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,123
...maybe you should ask someone who
wishes we didn't have the money...

876
00:54:57,327 --> 00:55:00,728
...so we couldn't move the church.

877
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,192
Deacon, you out of line.

878
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,128
- You are way out of line.
- Out of line?

879
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,665
Yeah, out of line.

880
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,030
- We need a safer environment.
- You have never-- 

881
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:12,004
- This is the wrong time to be arguing.
- Everybody just shut up! Shut up!

882
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:16,944
Y'all fuss and fight more
than me and LeeJohn up in here.

883
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,884
- Who's that?
- Mr. Wally.

884
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,520
He cleans the church.

885
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,690
Make a move,
I'll pop a cap in your ass.

886
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:31,225
You don't need to be scared.
He ain't got that many bullets.

887
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:34,295
He'd need one of them ones
where the bullets come all the way-- 

888
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,727
- He's legally blind.
- He can't see.

889
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,901
- He's partially deaf.
- He can't hear.

890
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,036
Then why y'all got this man
cleaning up?

891
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,102
He's free.

892
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,400
You don't need to clean
the church tonight.

893
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,600
Hey, man? Not tonight.

894
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,007
- Come again?
- Not tonight, man.

895
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:54,479
If I can't clean tonight,
it throws my whole week off.

896
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:58,051
What about my Monday appointment?
Can't do that till Tuesday.

897
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:02,485
What about my Tuesday appointment?
Can't do that till Wednesday.

898
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,387
What about my Wednesday
appointment?

899
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,653
Can't do that till Thursday.
What about my...?

900
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,057
He's free.

901
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:09,959
-- can't do that till Friday.

902
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:13,795
What about my Friday appointment?
Can't do that till Saturday.

903
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,971
Yo, who was that?

904
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,797
That was the blind and deaf
cleaning man.

905
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,600
You was supposed
to lock the doors.

906
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,835
I did! I ran out of chain!

907
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,673
Okay. Here's what we gonna do.

908
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,705
A little one- on- one session.

909
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,781
See if I can jog some memories.

910
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,850
So you, big mouth.

911
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,352
- Got your big mouth.
- Lay one hand on my daughter-- 

912
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,456
- I'll go first.
- No, no, no.

913
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:37,592
I'll go first. I'll talk to him.

914
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,296
I would go first, but first
has already been taken twice.

915
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:43,363
- I will go first.
- But, Pastor, listen-- 

916
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,227
- It's fine, Deacon.
- Daddy, you-- 

917
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,300
It's fine. Honey, it's fine.

918
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:51,770
It's fine. The Bible says first
will be last. I'm gonna be last first.

919
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,806
You can go first.

920
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,003
All right.

921
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:04,645
I'm gonna take his ass up there
and figure out where this is, okay?

922
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:08,847
You keep a eye on everybody.
Anybody move, you know what to do.

923
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:10,047
What?

924
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:13,625
- Take that.
- Another gun?

925
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,595
Who are you?

926
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,399
I'm telling you, King,
it's the mambo sauce.

927
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,728
That's the magic, my man.

928
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,303
- I hear you. I hear you.
- I'm telling you, boy.

929
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:26,137
Look at that. It's a disgrace.

930
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:28,037
The church owns that building,
right?

931
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:31,611
Yeah. If they're not gonna take care
of it, they should sell it.

932
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:37,012
Why would I steal money
from my own church?

933
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,414
We're here to find out.

934
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,918
Don't you got a Rolls- Royce?

935
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,988
- Bentley? Phantom?
- Ford.

936
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,456
- You throw some D's on that bitch?
- On a Ford?

937
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,562
I love Momma T. I do.

938
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:51,996
You are talking about
one of the sweetest, kindest...

939
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,796
...most gentle women ever.
But she'll steal.

940
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:56,631
At my age...

941
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,970
...the only thing
I'm looking to steal is time.

942
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:07,280
All the money in the world
can't buy that.

943
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:11,577
I love Sister Doris like-- 

944
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,222
Like she was my own sister.

945
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,455
But raising other people's children
is not cheap.

946
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,390
Kids is a necessary expense of life.

947
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,727
Every penny I get,
I put on that boy's costumes.

948
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:27,528
Last Christmas,
he was the Virgin Mary.

949
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:31,366
Thanksgiving, he was a drumstick.
Easter, he had to play a egg.

950
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:35,704
Anytime you wanna pitch in and help,
you are welcome. It is not cheap.

951
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,142
But I don't steal from nobody.

952
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,545
I love the deacon as....

953
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,421
It's endless. Got such
a dashing figure. Very articulate.

954
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,181
He's got to be getting some money.

955
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:52,020
Listen, I was brought here
to help fill the safe, not empty it.

956
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:54,253
Little pink shirts. I know they cost.

957
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,932
I think there's a lot of jealousy...

958
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:00,534
...about me and about
what I've done for the church.

959
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:04,798
Tianna. We talk like girlfriends.
Chitter- chatter.

960
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:08,444
Always, always, "How are you?"
"I'm good, how are you?" "I'm great."

961
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:11,170
She doesn't lie,
but you can tell she's thinking it.

962
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,576
Okay, but why would I steal
from my own father?

963
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:15,614
- Get your nails done.
- I do my own nails.

964
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,786
- Get your car fixed.
- I ride the train.

965
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,353
- Get your hair did.
- I don't have any hair!

966
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:24,124
To keep this church
from moving to the suburbs.

967
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:30,389
Help!

968
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,589
Shut it up!

969
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:33,268
Please don't make me use this!

970
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,767
- Yo, Durell?
- Please help us!

971
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,236
- You're hurting my arm!
- Everybody:

972
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,465
Be quiet!

973
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:41,610
Get up! Get in the basement.

974
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:46,111
Hurry up, Pink. Get up in there.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

975
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,977
LeeJohn, handle it.

976
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,219
Hey, Kirk Franklin, hold up.

977
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,615
I need to go with them-- 

978
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:55,052
- Boy, come on. You going with me.
- Where we going?

979
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,726
You gonna be the lady of the house.

980
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:01,324
Hello, upstanding gentlemen
of the law.

981
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,389
This church owns the building
across the street, right?

982
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,590
Yes.

983
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:08,828
Are you aware there's some
illegal activity taking place there?

984
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:13,236
Yes, my Lord

985
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,104
I'm just the choir director...

986
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:18,872
...but I will tell the pastor,
who is the shepherd of our flock.

987
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:21,573
We are sheep
and he shepherds us.

988
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:22,808
Don't be too late.

989
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,419
We saw some unsavory characters
lurking around there.

990
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,284
When you say unsavory,
you mean jaywalkers...

991
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:33,758
...or you mean like actual
robbers and thieves and killers?

992
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,931
Which one? Like, how unsavory?

993
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:41,160
Murder unsavory, or just regular,
run- of- the- mill unsavoriness?

994
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,772
Okay, well, you have a good evening,
all right? Just be careful.

995
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,834
Okay, then. All right.

996
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,445
Y'all can make this a base camp
at any....

997
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:56,281
- They was still talking to me.
- Thought that was cute, huh? Let's go.

998
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,115
Did it look like he was winking at us?

999
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,623
He's the choir director.

1000
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,496
All right, look.

1001
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:11,132
Don't y'all wanna go home?
I ain't got time for this.

1002
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,928
Now, y'all need to tell me
what I need to know.

1003
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:16,196
Don't y'all wanna go-- ?

1004
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,304
Don't y'all wanna go home?
Because I do.

1005
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,977
So somebody need to tell me
what I need to know.

1006
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,705
Look, if we have to comb this church
inch by inch....

1007
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:27,571
What now?

1008
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:31,618
It's all this humidity,
mixed with emotions and excitement.

1009
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:35,416
Mixed with the fact that we're being
held hostage by gangbangers...

1010
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,024
...in a church with no air.

1011
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:40,684
Tianna, get me a wet towel
for this child.

1012
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,831
Wait a minute, where you going?

1013
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,897
I'm getting her a wet towel.

1014
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:46,398
She needs some air!

1015
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:48,331
She needs to lose a few pounds...

1016
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,200
...if she's gonna be
landing on people like that.

1017
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:52,669
- Rickey.
- I'm just saying...

1018
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,070
...that would help
if people gotta catch her.

1019
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:57,644
- Thank you.
- Put it on the back of her neck, baby.

1020
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:01,078
All the money you making on
Sundays, why you can't get the air on?

1021
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:06,278
The air conditioning works,
it just don't work all the time, that's all.

1022
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:09,356
- Why doesn't somebody just fix it?
- Fix what?

1023
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,652
The air. Durell could fix anything.

1024
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:14,489
Remember that time your
aunt Cynthia's freezer broke...

1025
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:16,062
...after she went shopping?

1026
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,028
You came right over and fixed it.

1027
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:22,364
I don't remember.
Matter of fact, it ain't even hot to me.

1028
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:24,628
So we straight.

1029
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:28,202
- What church are you in?
- Rickey, sit down.

1030
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,106
What? No, get your hands off of me.

1031
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:33,646
- Sit down, man.
- lt is hot as Satan's toenails in here.

1032
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,841
Rickey? Are you all right?

1033
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:39,385
Yes, I'm all right.
Are you all right, Miss l- Just- Fainted?

1034
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,250
I'm just a little frustrated.

1035
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:45,553
I'm not scared no more.
I'm not just gonna keep being scared!

1036
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:50,427
Okay? So shoot me. Shoot me.
Here I am, shoot me.

1037
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,828
- Go ahead, shoot him.
- Shoot him. Go ahead.

1038
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:54,764
You'll probably really shoot me.

1039
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,233
Rickey, sit your butt down.

1040
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:01,308
Would you make sure that I look
good in my casket when l-- Lord!

1041
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:04,472
- Shut up!
- I'll scratch his eyes.

1042
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,147
Just fix the a.c., Durell.

1043
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:10,107
- Y'all get off of me! Get off of me!
- Don't trip out on me right now.

1044
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,117
Do anybody know
where this air- conditioning unit is?

1045
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,649
Hold up. Let me get that light.

1046
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,584
Come on, give it up.

1047
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:26,057
You're supposed to be fixing
the air conditioner, not taking a tour.

1048
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,668
I know.

1049
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,394
Let's go.

1050
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:35,871
First, we got to look for this money
in one more place.

1051
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:50,386
As hard as it is to keep crime out of
the streets, now it's in the church.

1052
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,390
Why would y'all steal money
from church?

1053
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,859
Because to them, it's not a church.

1054
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:57,464
It's a building on the corner
next to a liquor store.

1055
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,865
Where the neon wine- and- beer sign
is brighter than the cross.

1056
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:05,507
You know, if we separate the two
like I've been wanting...

1057
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,733
...maybe ours would shine brighter.

1058
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:09,741
Brighter because we're brighter,
Deacon?

1059
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,005
Or brighter
because we're separate?

1060
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:17,517
I want the key to that cabinet
right there...

1061
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,553
...and I know you got it, so don't lie.

1062
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,056
Were y'all trying
to blow open the safe?

1063
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,496
It wasn't my idea.

1064
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,189
You find it?

1065
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,397
Do it look like I found it? Let's go.

1066
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,232
What kind of name is LeeJohn,
anyway?

1067
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:19,444
When I was born, my mother had
two boyfriends. Lee and John.

1068
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,711
She ain't know who my real father
was, so she named me LeeJohn.

1069
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,643
Of course.

1070
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,623
I don't think I would've told that.

1071
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,722
Hot.

1072
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,566
You know...

1073
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,669
...if that doesn't work,
there's always Sho- Blo.

1074
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:50,141
Yeah, well, maybe it'll work
if I can get-- 

1075
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,477
If I can get the light pointed straight.

1076
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:57,210
Oh, yeah, the problem is the light.
It's my fault.

1077
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,579
I'm hungry.

1078
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,248
I'm hungry too.

1079
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,621
When are you not hungry?

1080
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:09,195
Well, I have some leftover chicken,
ham, potato salad, greens...

1081
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:12,993
...and some peach cobbler
from this afternoon's dinner.

1082
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:16,467
I could fix something up
if y'all would like to eat.

1083
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:22,974
What about a 8- year- old boy who was
hungry and didn't know how to swim?

1084
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:26,444
Was scared to get baptized because
he thought he was gonna drown?

1085
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,049
- How come he couldn't eat, huh?
- What?

1086
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,453
Is that a yes or a no on the chicken?

1087
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:46,196
How do you know how to fix
air conditioners, anyway?

1088
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:50,898
When you grow up in a house
and everything around you is broke...

1089
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:52,699
...that's what you do.

1090
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,933
You fix things. Watch this.

1091
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,314
Oh, my gosh.

1092
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,484
Hit that light.

1093
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,880
Don't wanna electrocute myself.

1094
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,250
Wow, you know, this thing has never
worked right. You're pretty good.

1095
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:11,620
I mean, you're obviously not good,
but what you just did was good.

1096
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:15,058
- You always so stank?
- Only when I'm hungry.

1097
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:19,132
And when I'm being held hostage at
gunpoint, I get a little a cranky.

1098
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,565
Maybe I got a good reason.
You ever think of that?

1099
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:25,070
You mean like Robin Hood?
Or, in your case, robbing the hood?

1100
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,606
Take from the poor
and give to the poor?

1101
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,675
Trying to give something
I never had.

1102
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,109
- A felony record?
- No, a father.

1103
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,077
Do you have a tissue I can borrow?

1104
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,251
I seem to have left mine
in the bucket...

1105
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:40,548
...along with anything that would
beep, buzz or get on your nerves.

1106
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:44,248
My mother died when I was 6.
You don't see me robbing a church.

1107
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,725
Yeah, sometimes you gotta do what
you gotta do to get where you going.

1108
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,261
Would that be jail?

1109
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:52,457
Parenting from within the penal
system, that would be brilliant.

1110
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,329
That's not smart.

1111
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:57,404
- You wouldn't even understand.
- And I don't want to.

1112
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,597
What you care for anyway,
church girl?

1113
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:01,367
- I don't.
- Good. Neither do l.

1114
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,976
- Good.
- Good.

1115
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,168
Good.

1116
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,540
G- double- O- D.

1117
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,010
- Good.
- Perfect.

1118
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:08,240
Wait a minute.

1119
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:16,784
- Thank you.
- Oh, Sister Doris' chicken.

1120
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:18,584
That's good.

1121
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:32,103
I brought you some food.
I know you hungry too.

1122
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,376
I don't have to get baptized, right?
Because I can't swim.

1123
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,375
No.

1124
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:40,611
- There you are.
- Thank you.

1125
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,075
It's good, ain't it?

1126
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:46,118
Something about you
remind me of my husband.

1127
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:50,891
I think it's your nose.
He had a wide one just like you.

1128
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:55,427
Oh, he was a beautiful man
inside and out.

1129
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,757
One of the best deacons this church
ever had. No matter what they say.

1130
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,829
He loved my cooking too.

1131
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:07,702
You know, today was his birthday,
and nobody remembered but me.

1132
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,378
He's been gone, what, six years?

1133
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:14,174
He loved the birthday parties
I planned for him.

1134
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:17,511
You like birthday parties, Leonard?
I mean, LeeJohn?

1135
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,019
- I don't know, I never had one.
- You never had a birthday party?

1136
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:25,660
When they took me to my foster home,
they lost my birth certificate...

1137
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:28,694
...so nobody never knew
when my birthday was.

1138
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,130
I know when it is.

1139
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,064
You do? When?

1140
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:36,863
Today.

1141
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:41,739
Give me your hand.

1142
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,217
Happy birthday.

1143
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,754
Come on, now.

1144
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:33,855
It's all right.

1145
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,362
It's all right.

1146
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:39,760
Yes, it is.

1147
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,303
It's all right.

1148
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:47,798
LeeJohn.

1149
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:50,904
The hell you doing?

1150
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,278
You hungry?

1151
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,212
It's blowing harder
than it's ever blown before.

1152
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,216
It's a miracle.

1153
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:03,687
It's air. The same air as before,
just a little cooler.

1154
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:06,053
A young man
as good with his hands as you are...

1155
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,093
...should have more options
than robbing.

1156
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,595
- I'm all out of options now.
- That's not true, son.

1157
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:12,232
Don't, that's not true.

1158
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,164
You're only out of options
when you stop looking for them.

1159
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:19,936
- Durell?
- Go back over there.

1160
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:23,270
- I need to talk to you.
- I don't wanna talk to you right now.

1161
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:25,470
Can I talk to you for one minute?

1162
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:29,447
I don't wanna do this anymore.
These people ain't did nothing to us.

1163
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:32,348
You came and got me from
my grandmama house with this...

1164
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:35,421
...and you don't wanna go through
with it? Trying to punk out?

1165
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:36,852
I ain't no punk, man.

1166
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:39,186
You ain't forgot
you need this as bad as me?

1167
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:42,193
I'll think of something,
and I don't know what it is.

1168
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,423
But I know...

1169
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,464
...it ain't gonna be this.

1170
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,194
Durell, not this.

1171
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:09,014
Our jobs would be easier if people
would just listen and go home.

1172
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,158
Pastor knows they
supposed to be out by 1 0.

1173
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,794
I don't know what y'all did,
but I don't like it.

1174
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:18,489
Now stop playing with me and just
give me the money and we can leave.

1175
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:21,192
For some reason,
y'all think I won't use these.

1176
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:23,803
It's simple! Just give up the money!

1177
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,497
I thought you were supposed
to be cleaning.

1178
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:27,869
I told you, he's blind.

1179
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,068
- Can't see, and he's deaf.
- He can't hear.

1180
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:33,510
I've been cleaning this church
for 30 years. Seen a lot of things...

1181
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:35,081
...found a lot of things too.

1182
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,013
Why y'all got this man cleaning?

1183
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,653
- Because he's free.
- But never nothing like this.

1184
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:44,023
Evening.

1185
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:48,786
All right, get back! Sit back!
Sit down.

1186
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,995
- Look at all that money.
- Yeah.

1187
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:57,195
It's probably just the cleaning man,
you know?

1188
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:01,735
Or not.

1189
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,977
We got a 1 0- 31 in progress at the
corner of Preston and Greenmount.

1190
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:11,516
A perp with a gun.
Request for immediate backup.

1191
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,051
That's our money.

1192
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:14,552
Son, that's God's money.

1193
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,929
LeeJohn, let's roll.

1194
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,662
LeeJohn.

1195
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:29,065
I think I'm gonna stay here
with them, Durell.

1196
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:39,211
It's your son, isn't it?

1197
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:42,206
Tell him what you're doing.

1198
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:50,618
You want him to hear it on the news?
Or read about it in tomorrow's paper?

1199
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:10,411
I get up every morning, and I take
my son to school every morning.

1200
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,907
He look at me, he don't see no thug.

1201
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:23,521
He see a man, all right?
I'm somebody to him.

1202
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,750
So you did this for your son?

1203
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,557
- Momma T.
- Momma T.

1204
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:35,498
You're doing this for yourself.

1205
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:41,869
Blaming everybody
but the one person responsible.

1206
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,775
You're a coward.

1207
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,283
Using foul language
and shooting guns off in the church...

1208
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,322
...you ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

1209
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,160
You deserve to lose your son.

1210
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:03,195
I'm not gonna lose my son!

1211
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:12,502
If this is what he sees in the morning
when he looks at you...

1212
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:15,475
...you've already lost him.

1213
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:18,976
A perfect example of potential
with no purpose.

1214
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,708
I know what my plan B is.
It's to be just like you.

1215
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:25,819
We can't lose any more sons.

1216
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:44,496
I'm not losing my son.

1217
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,939
Come on, LeeJohn, let's go.

1218
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:01,721
- lndividuals and suspects in the-- 
- Close the door.

1219
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,026
We want you
to release the hostages.

1220
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,855
Come out with your hands
in the air.

1221
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,894
Durell, man!

1222
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:11,664
We're going to jail!

1223
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,097
We're not going to jail!
Let me just think.

1224
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:18,000
What are you talking about?
They got this whole place surrounded.

1225
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:19,503
- We going to jail!
- Calm down!

1226
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,642
Pastor, isn't there something
we can do?

1227
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:25,973
Help the police put these criminals
behind bars where they belong.

1228
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:27,910
Deacon, I was talking to the pastor.

1229
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:29,310
You heard Momma T.

1230
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:32,248
They in here, waving
and shooting guns, and we're not-- 

1231
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:35,582
I haven't called your name all day!
Don't talk to me, okay?

1232
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,622
Quiet!

1233
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,250
I have an idea.

1234
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:43,022
Durell, come on, cut me out this chair,
I'll show you.

1235
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,220
Show me what?

1236
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,126
Son, I'm gonna show you
a better option.

1237
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:50,897
Come on, son.

1238
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,903
Pastor, they need to go to jail.

1239
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,439
They got two guns in here...

1240
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:58,602
...they're obviously gangbangers
and thugs and hoodlums.

1241
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:00,975
This doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't-- 

1242
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,242
Pastor? Pastor.

1243
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,579
- What?
- You're doing the right thing.

1244
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:10,156
What are you gonna do? You're
putting your ministry in jeopardy.

1245
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:14,125
Suspects inside the church!
Come out with your hands in the air!

1246
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:19,056
I am gonna go outside...

1247
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:24,261
...and tell those policemen this
was all just a big misunderstanding.

1248
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,839
You're gonna go out there and lie?

1249
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,703
Deacon, I'm gonna go and help.

1250
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,879
I'm gonna go out there,
and I'm gonna tell them the truth.

1251
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,846
That we were being held hostage
by terrorists.

1252
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:39,179
Or have we all forgotten that?

1253
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:44,492
What about forgiveness, Deacon?

1254
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,290
Or have you forgotten that?

1255
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,829
Pastor, these....

1256
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,390
I wasn't held hostage.

1257
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:57,003
- Neither was l.
- Me neither.

1258
01:17:58,273 --> 01:17:59,934
What's a hostage?

1259
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:04,636
A hostage is what we were in that
basement for four and a half hours.

1260
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:07,474
I'm gonna need therapy.
I need Dr. Ph-- 

1261
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:09,842
Okay, maybe not.

1262
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:11,883
Well, I was held hostage.

1263
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:15,250
And when the policemen get in here,
I'm gonna tell them exactly that!

1264
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:17,817
Do whatever you want.

1265
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,724
LeeJohn, Durell, y'all come on
with me. Come on.

1266
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:23,830
You can't be serious.

1267
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:27,866
You're a man of God,
and they're taking advantage of that!

1268
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,268
If we turn them in,
we can get a reward!

1269
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:34,101
We can do something.
We can do something to help.

1270
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:36,436
If you're going, I'm coming too.

1271
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:38,510
Hey, hey, hey.

1272
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:42,514
Where y'all going?
Sit down, sit down.

1273
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,482
Everybody's doing they part.
Sit down.

1274
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:47,814
Our part is singing.

1275
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:51,356
That's our part, what we do here
in the church as a choir, sing.

1276
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,460
We make things better, singing.

1277
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:57,462
Suspects, your time is up,
we are entering the building!

1278
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:17,408
- Police!
- Okay.

1279
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:18,847
Don't shoot! We're up here!

1280
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:20,749
There's a laundry chute
behind these.

1281
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:23,288
It's never been used,
first time for everything.

1282
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:24,891
Okay. Where does it go?

1283
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,529
To the basement. And there's a door
downstairs that'll get you out, I hope.

1284
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,290
- The rest is up to you.
- We gotta try.

1285
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,958
Pastor, what are you doing?
I'm getting the police.

1286
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,501
Police! We're up here!

1287
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:39,231
Let's go, guys, follow me.

1288
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,432
Hey, you better give me
those pistols.

1289
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:50,707
Thanks, man.

1290
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:52,784
You're doing the right thing.
Don't worry.

1291
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:55,286
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just have faith.

1292
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,159
Guess I'm supposed to go first,
right?

1293
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:01,954
I know you smarter than that.

1294
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,530
D, try not to break your neck.

1295
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,593
I didn't think you cared.

1296
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:14,503
I'll try.

1297
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:16,301
God bless you, son.

1298
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:22,012
Bye, LeeJohn!

1299
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:25,118
Goodbye, Timmy!

1300
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,918
Okay, let's go. Go, go, go.

1301
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,529
Durell, don't leave me!

1302
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,072
Come on, Rell, don't leave me!
Wait up!

1303
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:49,539
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

1304
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:53,111
- Spiderwebs! Spiderwebs!
- Go, go, go!

1305
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:58,976
Come on!

1306
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:02,788
Wait a minute.

1307
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:06,051
Yo, hey, that's our chair!
You ain't even crippled!

1308
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:50,629
Retreat!

1309
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:53,373
This way! Move!

1310
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,041
Yo, hold up.

1311
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,010
All right.

1312
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,439
This way, this way.

1313
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:03,209
Come on, come on, boy!

1314
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,113
Wait up! Wait up, Rell!

1315
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,617
- Rell!
- Hurry up.

1316
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,221
- Hurry up.
- Freeze!

1317
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:11,291
Back there, right there! Look!

1318
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:12,790
Freeze!

1319
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:22,959
You robbed a church?

1320
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:25,162
Your Honor, Mr. Judge,
it wasn't like that.

1321
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,500
We wasn't trying to rob.
We was gonna rebuild.

1322
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,973
We was gonna refurbish it
and everything. We-- 

1323
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:32,408
Allegedly robbed a church,
Your Honor.

1324
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:35,708
Your Honor, I haven't been to church
in a while-- I apologize.

1325
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:39,250
-- but the last I checked, the Holy Ghost
doesn't hold people hostage...

1326
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:41,149
...and the pastor isn't packing.

1327
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:44,450
- lf it pleases the court-- 
- I object to trying to please the court.

1328
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:47,526
Lewis, when are you going
to get a life-- ?

1329
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,822
You commit a crime,
you have to do the time.

1330
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:52,659
Can I speak?
Your Honor, can I speak?

1331
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:54,129
Can I speak for myself?

1332
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:56,629
- No objection to that, Your Honor.
- Why not?

1333
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:59,238
- I don't wanna go back to ja-- 
- Let me just say this.

1334
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:02,933
- We're in bad enough shape as it is.
- Okay, thank you. Just sit down.

1335
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:07,177
Judge Galloway, how many times
have you seen me in this courtroom?

1336
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:11,478
And how many times have you said
the same thing you saying today?

1337
01:23:11,686 --> 01:23:13,119
And here I am again.

1338
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,619
Man, my whole life
I done made bad decisions.

1339
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:18,122
Like the one you're making now?

1340
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:20,618
And my whole life,
I done blamed everybody...

1341
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,026
...but the person that's
responsible for those decisions.

1342
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:25,859
That's me.

1343
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:31,362
So it was my idea to go up
in that church. I want to apologize-- 

1344
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:35,304
Wait, that was my idea. We was
sitting in Cookie's that night and l-- 

1345
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,670
Sit your ass down!

1346
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:39,346
Now, Your Honor,
can we please get back to the facts?

1347
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:44,075
I have a witness that'll testify that
the defendants not only had firearms...

1348
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:48,745
...but they used them to
hold members of the church hostage.

1349
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:52,825
And they almost stole $64,000.

1350
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:58,398
Well, on first Sunday, you wrote down
that we took in $34,000.

1351
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:02,825
- Young lady, you'll have to sit down.
- But, Your Honor, I have proof.

1352
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,506
Bailiff, escort the young woman
to the witness stand.

1353
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,072
Go on up there, talk to him.

1354
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:08,867
Wait, what is that? What is that?

1355
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,545
Thieves in the temple.

1356
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:16,445
She's falsifying pieces of paper.
I don't know what that is, Pastor.

1357
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:24,284
In the report on first Sunday...

1358
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:28,121
...the deacon wrote down
that we only took in $34,000.

1359
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,297
- Pastor....
- He just said...

1360
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:33,865
...that they almost stole $64,000.

1361
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:38,099
- I did?
- Oh, now there's a discrepancy.

1362
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:41,332
- Why is she doing this to me?
- You see right here?

1363
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:45,412
Why are you doing this?
I'm not the one on trial.

1364
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,986
- ls there anything else?
- No. No, there isn't.

1365
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:54,617
- Deacon...
- What's going on, Deacon?

1366
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:58,281
...exactly how much money
was raised on the first Sunday?

1367
01:24:58,493 --> 01:24:59,960
Well, I object, Your Honor.

1368
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:02,356
- No, I object.
- Well, everybody objects.

1369
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:03,929
Answer the damn question.

1370
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:09,229
Look, the deacon is not on trial here.
However, these two miscreants are.

1371
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:12,406
Miscreants?
We are African- American.

1372
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:15,599
They held members
of the church hostage!

1373
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:20,846
These are criminals of the first order.
Period.

1374
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:23,142
The counsel will sit down.

1375
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,182
And the deacon
will answer the question.

1376
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:28,480
- The court is waiting.
- Yeah, answer the question.

1377
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:36,725
Well, Your Honor....

1378
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:38,159
If I may, Your Honor...

1379
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:42,894
...Iike you, I handle lots of paperwork
each and every day.

1380
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:45,732
And if an error was made...

1381
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:50,673
...in my haste, I must've mistakenly
entered a three instead of a six.

1382
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:57,309
I have never known the deacon
to make a mistake.

1383
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,885
Ridiculous.
People make mistakes all the time.

1384
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:02,784
You mistakenly got caught.
That's what happened.

1385
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:04,959
- Are you stealing the money?
- Of course not.

1386
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,390
I'm not angry.
If you did it, just say you did it.

1387
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:09,563
I came here to improve the church.

1388
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:12,699
I didn't steal the money.
I did not steal the money.

1389
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:14,562
I wasn't stealing money.

1390
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:17,067
Look, Pastor...

1391
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:19,530
...I'm investing it.

1392
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,674
He's an investor now.
Is he a stockbroker or a deacon?

1393
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:30,044
Order, order! Order in the court!

1394
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:31,980
Invested it where?

1395
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:37,086
In an escrow account for a piece of
land I wanted the church to purchase.

1396
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:38,850
Who? She don't go to this church.

1397
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:43,554
We aren't affecting the community,
the community is affecting us!

1398
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:46,996
I'm not infected.
I have papers to prove I'm not infected.

1399
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:50,171
It's them! These two right here!
They're the problem!

1400
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:55,168
Order, I said! Order in this court!
I've had enough.

1401
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:57,105
- Your Honor, let me finish.
- Sit down!

1402
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:59,576
- Sit down!
- Tough decisions have to be made!

1403
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:01,510
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

1404
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:03,946
- Sit down.
- You're lying again.

1405
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:05,414
Counselor?

1406
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:08,282
You have a witness to testify
that the defendants...

1407
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,957
...held members of the church hostage
with firearms...

1408
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:13,593
...while attempting to steal
from Sunday's offering?

1409
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:16,491
Look, Your Honor-- 

1410
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:18,632
Actually, Your Honor...

1411
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,795
...we have a lot of witnesses here...

1412
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:24,802
...that are willing to testify to
a lot of things, like embezzlement.

1413
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:28,237
- Embezzlement?
- Misappropriation of funds?

1414
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:30,001
Falsifying documents!

1415
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:35,547
Not to mention wearing a Easter suit
with a Halloween shirt- and- tie set.

1416
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,775
Now, that is not true!

1417
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:41,786
I will not have this man denigrating
my wardrobe in open court!

1418
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:43,924
Your Honor, can I just...?

1419
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:47,151
Let me just get a second here,
and I appreciate it, Your Honor.

1420
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:48,488
We need to have a word.

1421
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:52,792
Listen, I just need you to go up there
and tell him what is going on!

1422
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:54,229
Can you please have a seat?

1423
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:57,097
You have a degree, don't you?
Use it!

1424
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:59,671
- Counselor?
- Yes?

1425
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:01,599
Do you have a witness or not?

1426
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:05,576
Your Honor, if I may?

1427
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:09,546
It was a very long day,
and we had three services...

1428
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:12,015
...normally, it's two, and it was...

1429
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:14,617
...Iate...

1430
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:17,222
- ...and hot and dark.
- And no.

1431
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:20,189
No, Your Honor,
we have no more witnesses.

1432
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:22,887
Your Honor, if it pleases the court...

1433
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:27,500
...I would like to motion that the case
against Durell Douglas Washington...

1434
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:30,262
...and LeeJohn
James Jacob Jackson...

1435
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:34,771
...be dismissed due to
lack of evidence and witnesses.

1436
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,209
Yes, and because they didn't do it.

1437
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:44,245
Motion granted, case dismissed.

1438
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:52,491
This is a travesty!

1439
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:54,958
Praise the Lord.

1440
01:28:55,863 --> 01:28:57,330
Pastor! Pastor!

1441
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,635
Oh, yeah!

1442
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,241
I'm just trying to get-- 

1443
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:18,377
Ten chairs, $1 200 apiece.

1444
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,713
Check it out.
You stole them wheelchairs...

1445
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:22,753
...and then somebody stole them
from us.

1446
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:25,084
So the way I look at that,
I think we even.

1447
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:29,354
My baby mama might have
took my son away from me today.

1448
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:32,533
And if y'all gonna kill us
over some chairs, then go ahead.

1449
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:37,997
But kill him first
because it was his dumb- ass idea.

1450
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,174
We still have business.

1451
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:42,866
Go get your son, man.

1452
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:51,212
- Ticktock, gunshot.
- Leave me.

1453
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:54,750
Omunique?

1454
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,522
Omunique?

1455
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:06,892
Where did you get it, huh? Where?

1456
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:09,432
What is this?
I don't know what this is.

1457
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:12,663
Rell and I were leaving for the train
station when I hear a knock.

1458
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:15,707
I open it, nobody's there,
just this bag...

1459
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:20,472
...filled with $1 7,342 exactly!

1460
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:23,616
You stole it, didn't you?
Did you steal this?

1461
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:26,309
I know where it came from,
but I did not steal it!

1462
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,887
If I told you,
you wouldn't even believe me.

1463
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,149
I wouldn't even believe me.

1464
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:35,625
Look. Now, somebody gave me
this money.

1465
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:41,164
But since we got it,
I need to know something.

1466
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:43,963
You staying or you going?

1467
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:45,969
- That's not fair.
- You got enough money.

1468
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:48,870
You got what you need.
What you gonna do?

1469
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:51,337
You gonna take my son
away from me?

1470
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:53,677
And move to Atlanta?

1471
01:30:55,483 --> 01:30:59,351
Don't take my son from me. Okay?
That's all I got.

1472
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:04,850
All right, you wanna break me now?
He's all I got. I ain't got nothing else.

1473
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:07,960
I'll do whatever I can.
I'll come around more.

1474
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:10,995
Whatever you need from me,
I can do that.

1475
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:13,861
- I'm a different man now.
- What's different?

1476
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:18,129
I'm different. I'm changed.

1477
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:25,675
You gonna stay?

1478
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:30,741
What you gonna do?

1479
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:43,628
We're-- 

1480
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:47,200
We're gonna stay.

1481
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:54,341
Thank you.

1482
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,213
I told you. Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I tell you?

1483
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:08,252
- Yes.
- Ain't nobody gonna take you from me.

1484
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:11,148
Nobody.

1485
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:14,961
I love you.

1486
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,098
Thank you.

1487
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:35,742
It was no mistake how those two boys
landed in our church.

1488
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:42,412
They weren't all bad,
just 180 degrees from good.

1489
01:32:42,623 --> 01:32:46,559
They just needed a change
in direction...

1490
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:49,730
...and that's what we all need
sometimes.

1491
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:18,147
I figure...

1492
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:23,228
...if God can give these two boys
a second chance...

1493
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:26,664
... then why can't we?

1494
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:30,095
Why can't we?
